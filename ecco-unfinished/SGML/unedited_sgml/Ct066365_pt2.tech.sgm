<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IF Mi&s;s Villiers was elated with the &s;ud|den
return of her noble lover, a return
which &s;he, with great appearance of proba|bility,
attributed to the exce&s;s of his affec|tion,
and his inability to live longer ab&s;ent
from her; &s;he was &s;till more &s;o on receiving
<PB N="4" REF="5">
from him the next morning a letter, in
which, after &s;ome general profe&s;&s;ions of the
mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion, he intreated permi&s;&s;ion
to attend her in Berner's-&s;treet any evening
&s;he would appoint, when he could have the
plea&s;ure of entertaining her, without wit|ne&s;&s;es,
on a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence
to the future happine&s;s of <HI>his</HI> life,
and, he flattered him&s;elf, of <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>She read the letter a thou&s;and times; &s;he
ki&s;&s;ed the beloved name by which it was
&s;ub&s;cribed: her heart beat with emotions
equally new and delightful.</P>
<P>She had <HI>hoped,</HI> but till this charming mo|ment
&s;he could not with any propriety be
&s;aid to have <HI>believcd,</HI> the reality of that hap|pine&s;s
which now appeared to await her.</P>
<P>She &s;at down to write; it was the fir&s;t
letter in which &s;he had ever entered into &s;o
intere&s;ting a &s;ubject: Lord Melvile was the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
fir&s;t man &s;he had ever &s;uffered to &s;peak to
her of love, the fir&s;t man &s;he had ever re|garded
even with approbation.</P>
<P>She was embarra&s;&s;ed; &s;he took up the
pen; &s;he proceeded; &s;he found the letter
too tender; her delicacy was alarmed; &s;he
wrote another, &s;he found it too cold.</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;atisfied with every &s;entiment which
occurred, &s;he determined on &s;ending only a
card, to fix an evening when &s;he might have
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>But, what evening? was the que&s;tion;
and a que&s;tion not ea&s;ily an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Though &s;he would have wi&s;hed a conver|&s;ation
on which &s;o much depended, in re|&s;pect
to her future days, to have taken place
immediately, yet mode&s;ty (for &s;he was &s;upe|rior
to art), and that ba&s;hful timidity in&s;e|parable
from youth and &s;en&s;ibility like hers,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
influenced her to po&s;tpone Lord Melvile's
propo&s;ed vi&s;it till Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>She therefore wrote him, not an an&s;wer
to his letter, but a &s;hort card, inviting him
to tea, and, if he had no other engagement,
to &s;upper, on Thur&s;day evening.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t perfect ignorance of the
world, and the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting tem|per
exi&s;ting, will, in candid minds, but in
no other, apologize for Mi&s;s Villiers's ex|treme
imprudence in inviting Lord Melvile
to a <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> &s;upper; and that, in con&s;e|quence
of a declaration which was far from
being explicit as to its tendency.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
The exuberance of her joy had once
more hurried her beyond the bounds of that
indi&s;pen&s;able, that cardinal virtue, Di&s;cre|tion;
a virtue without which all others lo&s;e
their exterior lu&s;tre, and which is the only
adequate guardian of female honour.</P>
<P>The world will judge, and it has a right
to judge, by probable appearances; and
though innocence may e&s;cape the &s;nare it
has laid for it&s;elf in forming an indi&s;creet
appointment, yet reputation will be the in|evitable
&s;acrifice.</P>
<P>The dignity and purity of Maria's mind
left her without an idea of danger from &s;uch
an interview; and even, if a doubt had
ari&s;en, her unbounded e&s;teem for, and con|fidence
in, the object of her affection, would
have &s;ilenced it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
Convinced of the rectitude of Lord Mel|vile's
intentions, the lea&s;t &s;hadow of &s;u&s;pi|cion
would, in her own opinion, have ren|dered
her unworthy his generous, his di&s;in|tere&s;ted
tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her imagination repre&s;ented to her in the
livelie&s;t colours his tran&s;port at placing the
woman he loved in a &s;ituation &s;o worthy of
her.</P>
<P>She would have almo&s;t envied &s;uch ex|ce&s;s
of felicity to any being but Lord Mel|vile.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>HIS lord&s;hip &s;aw the whole affair
through a medium extremely dif|ferent.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
Maria's invitation left him not a doubt of
&s;ucce&s;s in his de&s;ign; a de&s;ign he had been
forming with great coolne&s;s and deliberation
ever &s;ince he left his father's &s;eat in York&s;hire.</P>
<P>He therefore &s;at down, to con&s;ider how
he &s;hould regulate the future hou&s;ehold,
and &s;tate the nece&s;&s;ary expences, of our he|roine,
whom from this moment he regarded
as a part of his equipage.</P>
<P>His marriage, the preliminaries of which
were &s;ettled, though he had not yet &s;een his
intended bride, and which was to be con|cluded
&s;oon after his father's return to town,
made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to think of taking
her to Gro&s;venor-&s;treet.</P>
<P>It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould have
a hou&s;e, and an e&s;tabli&s;hment of her own.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
Naturally liberal in every part of his ex|pence,
he was profu&s;e, and with a &s;trong
mixture of o&s;tentation, in his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>As no man of the world marries with any
view but that of paying off the old debts of
his paternal e&s;tate, in order to be able to
contract new ones in his turn, a mi&s;tre&s;s is
an almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able part of a matrimo|nial
arrangement in high life; unle&s;s, which
is a plan attended with &s;ome hazard, affairs
of gallantry with women in high life &s;hould
be preferred.</P>
<P>The declared mi&s;tre&s;s of a man of his
rank ought to appear with eclat.</P>
<P>The <HI>declared</HI> mi&s;tre&s;s it was determined
&s;he &s;hould be.</P>
<P>As vanity was the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of
his &s;oul, he could not re&s;i&s;t the triumph his
imagination promi&s;ed him, in producing (as
<PB N="11" REF="12">
&s;oon as decency after his marriage would
permit) &s;o much beauty, as his property,
to the world.</P>
<P>Indeed, this was his mo&s;t powerful motive
for making choice of our heroine, his in|clination
being much &s;tronger for Dorig|non;
but Dorignon was not hand&s;ome
enough to do honour to his choice.</P>
<P>He had however another rea&s;on for the
preference he gave to Mi&s;s Villiers.</P>
<P>The vivacity of Dorignon's temper ren|dered
her the mo&s;t improper mi&s;tre&s;s
breathing for a man who intended to
marry.</P>
<P>There would have been no an&s;wering for
the manner in which &s;he might have ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her ira&s;cible feelings, if &s;he had met
her honourable rival in public.</P>
<P>Mais, a nos moutons.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
The fortune of the de&s;tined Lady Mel|vile,
and the con&s;equent &s;ettlements to be
made by his father on him&s;elf, would ren|der
his &s;ituation affluent, and ju&s;tify a little
extraordinary expence in &s;o important an
article as a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villiers's per&s;on, her air, her con|ver&s;ation,
her deportment, her <HI>tout en&s;em|ble,</HI>
conveyed &s;o &s;trikingly the idea of a
woman of condition; &s;he was &s;o formed to
become an elegant &s;tyle of life; her pre&s;ent
appearance (if we &s;et a&s;ide her being in a
lodging) was &s;o corre&s;pondent to that idea,
that he could not think of offering her com|mon
terms.</P>
<P>Convinced, as he was determined to be,
that &s;he was an adventurer, and that her
views corre&s;ponded with his own; yet he
felt a kind of re&s;pect, when with her, for
which he could not account.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
It was not &s;ufficient to make him de&s;i&s;t
from his pur&s;uit, but it determined him to
make &s;uch an ample provi&s;ion for her as
&s;hould demon&s;trate to the world the gene|ro&s;ity
of his di&s;po&s;ition, and, at the &s;ame
time, give the often&s;ible godde&s;s of his ido|latry
that exterior &s;plendor which aims at
confounding ranks and characters, and put|ting
humble virtue out of countenance.</P>
<P>A dramatic writer, who&s;e name I forget,
&s;ays, &startq;Virtuous women walk on foot:&endq;
which mu&s;t not be under&s;tood to in&s;inuate,
that only vicious women go in carriages;
and can certainly mean no more than this,
that, if a woman is not born to a coach, &s;he
will never acquire one by her virtue.</P>
<P>From which premi&s;es we draw a conclu|&s;ion;
a conclu&s;ion which may not perhaps
be univer&s;ally &s;ub&s;cribed to, that a coach
is not, as &s;ome people &s;uppo&s;e, a nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="14" REF="15">
concomitant of human happine&s;s; &s;ince
heaven could never intend its creatures
&s;hould be le&s;s happy in proportion as they
de&s;erved to be more &s;o.</P>
<P>In other words, heaven could never or|dain,
that poverty &s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily the
companion of virtue; or, that &startq;Virtuous
women &s;hould walk on foot.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>A propos,</HI> I have often wondered at the
various ideas annexed to this re&s;pectable
word, virtue; a word which in ancient
Rome meant public &s;pirit; in modern Rome
means a ta&s;te in the fine arts; in England,
at lea&s;t in the female vocabulary, means
cha&s;tity; and in France has little or no
meaning at all.</P>

<P>THERE are lovers who would have
thought it a tedious interval between
the pre&s;ent hour and Thur&s;day evening.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Lord Melvile: the opera to-night,
and Bach's concert to-morrow&mdash;he did not
well know how to &s;pare Thur&s;day&mdash;if &s;he
had luckily fixed on Friday, he had no en|gagement.</P>
<P>Some true-born Engli&s;hman, &s;ome ge|nuine
&s;on of nature, who has not &s;oftened
his manners, and hardened his heart, by a
French education, may perhaps wonder at
the <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> and &s;toical deliberation, with
which Lord Melvile pur&s;ued a mi&s;tre&s;s,
whom he notwith&s;tanding intended to &s;up|port
at an extravagant expence.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
He will be &s;urprized that he &s;hould
coolly &s;it down and calculate this expence
with the preci&s;ion of a clerk in a merchant's
counting-hou&s;e; and be &s;o methodically
di&s;creet in an affair which &s;eems founded in
indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>He will &s;et no bounds to his a&s;toni&s;hment

is not deficient either in under&s;tanding or
good-nature, chu&s;es to incur the guilt of
&s;eduction without even the excu&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion
to alleviate his crime.</P>
<P>But a man of <HI>bon ton</HI> is a man of rea&s;on,
not of pa&s;&s;ion; he is invulnerable to the
&s;hafts of beauty; and is vicious from prin|ciple,
not inclination.</P>
<P>It is to the &s;hrine of Vanity, not to that
of Love, his adoration is directed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE lively red in the cheek of Maria
went and returned a thou&s;and times
in the cour&s;e of this narration; her heart
beat thick with contrary pa&s;&s;ions; fear, a
faint ray of hope, uncertainty, di&s;appoint|ment,
indignation, took their turns; the
latter at length prevailed, and enabled her
to bear this unexpected &s;troke with becom|ing
&s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">
She repre&s;&s;ed the tear which was ready
to &s;tart, the tear of blended re&s;entment and
di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She determined to make no further ap|plication
to the theatres till &s;he &s;hould glit|ter
in the gay circle as Lady Melvile; and
the moment that event, which could not be
far di&s;tant, &s;hould take place, to make a pre|&s;ent
of her piece to the other hou&s;e; let|ting
the manager who had treated her &s;o
contemptuou&s;ly know, <HI>who&s;e</HI> play it was he
had not conde&s;cended to read.</P>
<P>Elated with this idea, &s;he thanked Mr.
Hammond for the unplea&s;ing &s;tep he had
taken in the hope of &s;erving her; and re|placed
the unfortunate tragedy in her bu|reau,
with an air of tranquillity which ef|fectually
deceived him.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
He was now convinced of what he had
before, from her apparent anxiety, a little
doubted, that fame was the only object &s;he
had in view, and that no inconvenience
would ari&s;e from her waiting a more fa|vourable
moment.</P>
<P>Perfectly at ea&s;e in this point, he pro|ceeded
to give her his opinion on the gene|ral
&s;ubject of writing for the theatre; a
pur&s;uit in which her &s;ex, her delicacy of
mind, her rectitude of heart, her hone&s;t
pride, and perhaps her genius, were all
&s;trongly again&s;t her &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed her to keep her piece&mdash;not
nine years, but till more liberal maxims of
government &s;hould take place in the impor|tant
empire of the theatre; an empire on
the faithful admini&s;tration of which de|pended,
not only national ta&s;te, but in a
great degree national virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
&startq;The incoherent jumble of words with|out
ideas, which I have been repeating to
you, madam,&endq; pur&s;ued he, &startq;is, I am
told, the general an&s;wer to dramatic wri|ters,
who are intended to be di&s;gu&s;ted by
this unworthy treatment, which the ma|nagers
honour with the name of policy,
from thinking of any future applica|tions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That vulgar, unenlightened, minds
&s;hould act with this wretched imitation
of craft (for even craft is here too re|&s;pectable
an appellation), I &s;hould natu|rally
expect; but that a man of excellent
under&s;tanding, of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed
talents, the idol of the public; with as
much &s;ame as his mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes can
a&s;pire to, and more riches than he knows
how to enjoy; &s;hould de&s;cend to &s;uch
contemptible arts, with no nobler a view
than that of robbing the Dramatic Mu&s;e,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
to whom he owes that fame and tho&s;e
riches, of her little &s;hare of the reward, is
a truth almo&s;t too improbable to be be|lieved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Would it not have been wi&s;er, as well
as more manly, to have &s;aid, in the clear|e&s;t
and mo&s;t unambiguous terms,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, we have no occa&s;ion for new pieces
while there are only two Engli&s;h theatres
in a city &s;o exten&s;ive and opulent as Lon|don;
a city which, in the time of Eliza|beth,
when the frequenters of the theatre
were not a tenth part of the pre&s;ent, &s;up|ported
&s;eventeen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We will therefore never receive any
new production but when we are com|pelled
to it by recommendations which
we dare not refu&s;e: nor will I read the
tragedy you bring, le&s;t its merit &s;hould
make me a&s;hamed to reject it.&endq;</P>

&startq;This would have been indeed the lan|guage
of a thankle&s;s &s;on of the drama;
the language of a man having no object

gratitude to that publick, and to that
beautiful art, to which he was &s;o much
indebted; but it would have been the
language of a man, and a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
&s;ufficient courage to avow his principle
of action.&endq;</P>

reached the &s;ummit of theatrical
perfection.&endq;</P>

On a favourite theme the garrulous old

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>GRATEFUL as Mi&s;s Villiers really
was for Mr. Hammond's very friendly
interpo&s;ition in favour of her tragedy, &s;he
was not perfectly &s;atisfied with his mode of
application.</P>
<P>He had depended too much on him&s;elf,
and on his &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t with the acting
manager.</P>
<P>He had, be&s;ides, even from his own ac|count,
conver&s;ed with this gentleman in a
&s;tyle far removed from the per&s;ua&s;ive, and
not a little tending towards the dictatorial.</P>
<P>After all, the manager might not be &s;o
much to blame.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
Mr. Hammond had neglected adverting
to two circum&s;tances, which appeared to her
of infinitely more importance to her &s;ucce&s;s
than the protection of fifty peevi&s;h old fel|lows
like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances he had thus injudici|ou&s;ly
omitted to mention, would naturally
have had great weight with a man of ge|nius,
who as &s;uch could not fail of being a
man of delicate and refined gallantry, and
a zealous partizan of female excellence.</P>
<P>He &s;hould have urged, that the piece in
que&s;tion was the production of a woman
[he might, without the imputation of flat|tery,
have added, of a young and amiable
woman, of family and unblemi&s;hed charac|ter],
and that the part of the heroine was
exqui&s;itely adapted to di&s;play in full light
the brilliant powers of the actre&s;s who filled
the fir&s;t characters at his theatre.</P>
<P>She had hinted both the&s;e particulars to
Mr. Hammond the fir&s;t time he had at|tended
<PB N="39" REF="40">
her on this bu&s;ine&s;s; but a &s;arca&s;ti|cal
&s;mile of di&s;approbation had prevented
her entering further into the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The truth is, he declined u&s;ing tho&s;e ar|guments,
becau&s;e he thought them both
extremely unfavourable to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>She was not quite clear &s;he had acted
wi&s;ely in con&s;ulting <HI>this</HI> Mr. Hammond; he
might be a very good kind of man, but
apparently ignorant of the world; nor did
&s;he find that he was a man <HI>anybody knew.</HI></P>
<P>He was &s;plenetic, fretful; and &s;he could
not help believing, from the &s;evere &s;tyle in
which he &s;poke of theatrical direction in ge|neral,
that he had, in the early part of his
life, been a candidate, and an un&s;ucce&s;sful
one, for the dramatic laurel.</P>
<P>In this, however, &s;he was mi&s;taken; as
&s;he was in imagining &s;he knew the world
<PB N="40" REF="41">
better than a man who had pa&s;&s;ed all his
life, and that life not a &s;hort one, in the fir&s;t
company of which it is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>He had not indeed the honour of being
of a <HI>certain &s;et;</HI> but there were coteries ra|ther
more e&s;timable, where his merit re|ceived
the mo&s;t flattering di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>But to return to Mi&s;s Villiers.</P>
<P>She now wi&s;hed ardently &s;he had pur|&s;ued
her fir&s;t plan, of writing to, or &s;eeing,
the manager her&s;elf; &s;he was certain &s;he
&s;hould have &s;ucceeded better; nor &s;hould
&s;he, in that ca&s;e, have been without hopes
of prevailing on this great actor to perform
the character in her piece which &s;he had
written on purpo&s;e for him.</P>
<P>It was however too late to take this &s;tep,
and therefore regret was folly.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
She had judged ill in tru&s;ting this impor|tant
affair to a &s;tranger, but no matter&mdash;Lady
Melvile's play would undoubtedly be
<HI>received,</HI> though Mi&s;s Villiers's had not even
been <HI>read.</HI></P>
<P>She could not recollect this la&s;t humi|liating
circum&s;tance without feeling her re|&s;entment
again&s;t the manager revive.</P>
<P>The blu&s;h of anger had not left her
cheek, when Lord Melvile, unexpectedly,
entered the room.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip, who had been riding in
Hyde Park, had there met the lovely Lady
B&mdash;, who had in&s;i&s;ted &s;o earne&s;tly, before
twenty of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable people in
town, on his meeting her at Almack's on
Thur&s;day evening, that he mu&s;t have lo&s;t
all reputation as a gallant man had he re|fu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">
Not that he had the lea&s;t inclination for
Lady B&mdash;, or &s;he for him: on the contrary,
&s;he was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of giving the pre|ference
to her Lord; but &s;he was amazingly
<HI>the ton,</HI> and therefore to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
by her was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>What was to be done in this perplexing
&s;ituation? To have po&s;tponed an a&s;&s;igna|tion,
would have been as great a &s;oleci&s;m in
gallantry as to have refu&s;ed Lady B&mdash;'s
challenge: to anticipate it, would have a
much better air.</P>
<P>He &s;ettled it with him&s;elf, to call on Mi&s;s
Villiers before he went home; to di&s;&s;emble
a little impatience, and to prevail on her, if
po&s;&s;ible, to change the time &s;he had fixed
for their <HI>tete-a-tete,</HI> and permit him to &s;up
with her the approaching evening, after the
opera.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
He addre&s;&s;ed her with that per&s;ua&s;ive
ea&s;y grace &s;o natural to him on all occa&s;ions,
and &s;o extremely u&s;eful on mo&s;t, and found
very little difficulty in carrying his point.</P>
<P>Her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;etting her love
a&s;ide, made procra&s;tination extremely incon|venient
to her: &s;he had failed in one of her
great pur&s;uits; it was therefore indi&s;pen&s;a|bly
requi&s;ite &s;he &s;hould be clearly informed
what &s;he had to expect as to the other; and
an eclairci&s;&s;ement, though her mode&s;ty
would have deferred it, could not arrive too
&s;oon.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile returned home to dre&s;s;
and Maria &s;ent for Mrs. Merrick up &s;tairs,
to order her &s;upper.</P>
<P>She explained her&s;elf no farther than by
&s;aying, &s;he &s;hould have a friend to &s;up with
her, and de&s;iring to have the table &s;et out
with elegance.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
Mrs. Merrick &s;uppo&s;ed the expected gue&s;t
to be Lady Hardy, who had more than once
&s;upped with our heroine before; but had
too much re&s;pect for her young lady (&s;o
&s;he always called Mi&s;s Villiers) to a&s;k the
que&s;tion.</P>
<P>She withdrew, to make the nece&s;&s;ary ar|rangements
for the evening; and Mi&s;s Vil|liers
retired to her dre&s;&s;ing-room, to prepare
for the mo&s;t important hour of her life;
an hour, on the events of which depended
the good or ill of her whole future days;
an hour, which was to decide whether &s;he
was de&s;tined to be the mo&s;t wretched, or
the mo&s;t happy, of womankind.</P>
<P>Sanguine as &s;he naturally was, the di&s;ap|pointment
of the morning had a little abated
her pre&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
She had been, in idea, quite as certain of
&s;ucce&s;s in the one point as in the other; and
yet &s;he had failed.</P>
<P>But then&mdash;there was a very e&s;&s;ential dif|ference&mdash;
She was a &s;tranger to the manager,
and it was therefore ea&s;y to mi&s;take his cha|racter
and turn of thinking.</P>
<P>She had &s;uppo&s;ed (and &s;he might per|haps,
if any manager had elevation of mind
&s;ufficient to try the experiment, be ju&s;tified
in this &s;eemingly Utopian idea), that the di|rector
of a theatre mu&s;t at the &s;ame time ta&s;te
the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ure, and reap the mo&s;t
permanent advantage, in encouraging ge|nius
and gratifying the publick, by giving
pieces of &s;uperior excellence, without re|gard
to any con&s;ideration but that excellence
it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
On this &s;uppo&s;ition, after Mr. Ham|mond's
very favourable judgement of her
tragedy, &s;he had looked on it as certain it
would be received.</P>
<P>She had therefore only formed illu&s;ive ex|pectations
by the commone&s;t error in the
world; that of rea&s;oning right on principles
which, unhappily, were wrong.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to Lord Melvile the ca&s;e was
very different; &s;he was almo&s;t as well ac|quainted
with his heart as with her own.</P>
<P>Could that countenance deceive&mdash;But
away with &s;u&s;picion&mdash;Lord Melvile's mind
was as faultle&s;s as his form.</P>
<P>His &s;oul was an emanation of the divini|ty:
a lively image of the <HI>fir&s;t good, fir&s;t per|fect,</HI>
and <HI>fir&s;t fair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">
Be&s;ides, on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, her

to direct her conduct.</P>

&s;uperannuated policy, had, thank
heaven.! nothing to do in this affair.</P>
<P>Her hair-dre&s;&s;er interrupted this train of
reflections: he was de&s;ired to exert his ut|mo&s;t
&s;kill; he obeyed, but &s;he was far from
being &s;atisfied: he had never dre&s;&s;ed her &s;o
well, yet never found it &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to

<P>His work fini&s;hed, he ob&s;erved, with a
very re&s;pectful bow, that her lady&s;hip had
had the goodne&s;s to order her bill; he
&s;hould not have taken the liberty to remind

<P>This mild, inoffen&s;ive chit-chat filled up
the interval, a very &s;hort one, between his

&s;upper.</P>
<P>They &s;at down; Lord Melvile ate ama|zingly,

Mrs. Merrick had really this evening

to all the natural vivacity of her temper.</P>
<P>The bewitching melody of her voice; the

<P>Poi&s;oned as his ta&s;te unhappily was by
the boundle&s;s licence of vicious conver&s;a|tion,
he yet found a thou&s;and unexpected
charms in that of our heroine.</P>
<P>He even found her amu&s;ing, of which
till this moment he had not conceived the
remote&s;t idea.</P>
<P>As his &s;elf-love was gratified to its ut|mo&s;t

<PB N="55" REF="56">
to plea&s;e, by her &s;miles of undi&s;&s;embled af|fection

them with almo&s;t equal &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>He had, he was convinced, nothing $word$

not avow it? He even fancied &s;he expected

<P>Her tenderne&s;s for him was too evident

<P>THEY had &s;upped, the conver&s;ation
was beginning to grow intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile, after a thou&s;and prote&s;ta|tions
of the mo&s;t &s;incere attachment, had
gone &s;o far as to declare that the happine&s;s
of his future life depended entirely on pa&s;|&s;ing
it with her.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
He had proceeded, in expre&s;&s;ions which
were rather equivocal, to offer her <HI>carte
blanche</HI> in re&s;pect to &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>As her idea of the word &s;ettlement dif|fered
very e&s;&s;entially from his lord&s;hip's,
&s;he looked on their marriage as concluded,
and could with difficulty re&s;train the tran&s;|ports
of her heart.</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, looked aba&s;hed, dropped a
tear of mixed tenderne&s;s and gratitude, and
was for &s;ome time unable to &s;peak.</P>
<P>She at la&s;t a&s;&s;umed &s;ufficient courage to
tell him, though with he&s;itation, that &s;he
had the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of his lord&s;hip's
genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of &s;entiment; but
that &s;he loved him for him&s;elf alone, and
was indifferent to every other con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
As he looked on the&s;e as words of cour&s;e,
which meant nothing, he pre&s;&s;ed her to be
more explicit.</P>
<P>She was going to refer him to Col.
Dormer for an an&s;wer, when the door
opened, and a very genteel man, about
twenty-five, in regimentals, entered the
room, with an air of the mo&s;t perfect ea&s;e
and unconcern, humming a part of one of
the favourite &s;ongs in Montezuma.</P>
<P>He &s;topped &s;hort, appeared confu&s;ed,
looked round with a&s;toni&s;hment, and, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
Maria with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful air,
attempted to apologize for an intru&s;ion
which he had not intended.</P>
<P>&startq;Can you forgive me, madam? I found
the &s;treet-door open, and mi&s;took it for
my own apartment, which is in the next
hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
&startq;I am a&s;hamed of my indi&s;cretion, but
you have nothing to fear from it.&endq;</P>
<P>He hurried down, after he had &s;aid this,
without waiting for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Neither Mi&s;s Villiers nor Lord Melvile
could &s;peak; they were both petrified with
&s;urprize.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's was, however, a &s;urprize
mixed with uncertainty and chagrin.</P>
<P>He knew not how to give credit to the
&s;tranger's &s;tory of mi&s;taking the hou&s;e; it
was very improbable, to &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>He might be a lover, and a favoured
one; or, at lea&s;t, one who had been fa|voured,
and was &s;till in the li&s;t of her
friends.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
His familiar manner of entering the
room, his unembarra&s;&s;ed addre&s;s to Maria,
his retiring without waiting an an&s;wer, gave
Lord Melvile, who had been taught to
think ill of the human heart, &s;u&s;picions &s;till
more injurious to both.</P>
<P>He even fancied, and how creative is
fancy! that he had &s;een mutual glances of
intelligence.</P>
<P>He thought it more than po&s;&s;ible he was
in danger of becoming a dupe to the mo&s;t
infamous artifice; and that Maria, in her
&s;eeming attachment to him, had been only
acting an a&s;&s;umed character, in order to de|ceive.</P>
<P>His vanity combated, but could not con|quer,
this very mortifying idea.</P>
<P>Unable to recover his good-humour, or
to re&s;olve in what manner to take this ex|traordinary
<PB N="61" REF="62">
adventure, he found it impo&s;&s;i|ble,
and indeed he thought it impolitic, to
re&s;ume the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villiers, who was &s;till more di&s;con|certed,
without having merited to be at all
&s;o, had an air of perplexity and &s;elf-con|demnation,
which added &s;trength to Lord
Melvile's &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>She was much more at a lo&s;s than his
lord&s;hip, how to behave in &s;o uncommon a
conjuncture.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion &s;he felt on the &s;tranger's
entering the room, gave her the fir&s;t idea of
her own imprudence in allowing Lord Mel|vile's
midnight vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger's apology for his intru&s;ion,
though apparently re&s;pectful, &s;hewed too
plainly the light in which he regarded the
party.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
She was alarmed, &s;he was determined to
be more guarded for the future; &s;he en|treated
Lord Melvile to retire.</P>
<P>She was not without apprehen&s;ion as to
the continuance of his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>She dreaded lo&s;ing his good opinion by
that very indi&s;cretion of which her too great
anxiety to oblige him had been the &s;ole
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The delicacy in&s;eparable from real affec|tion
taught her to be the more careful of
her own honour becau&s;e it was &s;oon to be
his.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, without knowing well how to
develop her ideas, &s;he found them crowd
upon her too fa&s;t for expre&s;&s;ion; nor in|deed
were they &s;uch as &s;he would have
cho&s;en indi&s;criminately to communicate.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
The continuity of the &s;cene being broken
by this unexpected event, and both feeling
an embarra&s;&s;ment which made it very diffi|cult
to recover the thread of their di&s;cour&s;e;
each found a thou&s;and plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for
&s;eparating, and deferring the &s;ubject, on
which they were ju&s;t entering, to another
opportunity.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's politene&s;s, however, and
that art which he had taken &s;o much pains
to acquire, got &s;o entirely the better of his
di&s;plea&s;ure, that he left her without her en|tertaining
the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion that he at|tributed
to her any &s;hare in this my&s;terious
adventure.</P>
<P>He was really extremely at a lo&s;s, as well
how to determine on this important point,
as how to form a ju&s;t idea of her general
character.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
He he&s;itated whether to pronounce her
the mo&s;t artle&s;s, or the mo&s;t de&s;igning, of
her &s;ex.</P>
<P>As he very naturally, in which we wi&s;h
he had more imitators, looked on his father
as his firme&s;t friend, and the per&s;on mo&s;t
intere&s;ted in his happine&s;s, he with great
prudence re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend the pre&s;ent
negotiation till Lord Claremont's return to
town; to give his lord&s;hip, without di&s;gui&s;e
or palliation, a circum&s;tantial relation of the
whole tran&s;action, &s;o far as it had already
gone; and to a&s;k his advice whether he

breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">
The grave air of this good woman

<P>&startq;Very well, I thank you, madam,

<P>After fifty apologies, and as many pro|te&s;tations
that it was the fir&s;t time in her life
&s;he ever thought her in the wrong, &s;he took
the liberty, which her long and faithful at|tachment
<PB N="69" REF="69">
to the family of Mi&s;s Villiers ren|dered
ju&s;tifiable, of remon&s;trating gently on
the indi&s;creet party of the night before, and
its probable ill con&s;equences to her reputa|tion,
and of cour&s;e to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She placed the impropriety of this &s;up|per
in &s;o &s;trong a light, that Maria, who
had the utmo&s;t indulgence for her, in order
to remove her anxiety, confe&s;&s;ed to her, but
under the &s;tricte&s;t injunctions of &s;ecrecy,
that &s;he was in a very &s;hort time to be mar|ried
to Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>She added, that Lord Melvile's motive
for this &s;eemingly ill-timed vi&s;it, was to
con&s;ult her, without interruption, on the
nece&s;&s;ary &s;ettlements to be made on this
intere&s;ting occa&s;ion; and that he cho&s;e the
evening as the mo&s;t certain time to find her
without company.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70">
She de&s;ired her to be under no apprehen|&s;ion
of her di&s;plea&s;ure; a&s;&s;ured her &s;he did
not blame her, ignorant as &s;he was of the
only circum&s;tance which could render her
excu&s;able, for thinking the party indi&s;|creet.</P>
<P>She however told her, &s;he expected, after
&s;uch a proof of her unlimited confidence,
that, whatever vi&s;its &s;he might in future have
occa&s;ion to receive from Lord Melvile, &s;he
&s;hould re&s;t &s;atisfied with the propriety of
her conduct; which ever had been, and ever
&s;hould be, regulated by the mo&s;t punctilious
rules of virtue and honour.</P>
<P>She proceeded to inform her, that &s;he
&s;hould in a po&s;t or two, which was really
her intention, write to entreat Col. Dormer
to come to town, in order to arrange the
preliminaries of this marriage with Lord
Claremont.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="71">
Mrs. Merrick, who thought there was
no alliance to which her young lady had not
a right to pretend; who knew her incapa|ble
of even the &s;hadow of fal&s;ehood; and
who had, from his beauty to which women
are always partial, and his affability for
which all the world have the &s;ame prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
a &s;trong inclination to think highly
of Lord Melvile; was almo&s;t out of her
&s;en&s;es with plea&s;ure, on receiving this unex|pected
intelligence.</P>
<P>She made Mi&s;s Villiers a thou&s;and con|gratulatory

She looked on this as no breach of confi|dence

knew her brother to be an adept in the art
of keeping &s;ecrets, having been, in his
youth, for &s;everal years, the favourite do|me&s;tic
of one of the clerks in one of the
mo&s;t important of the public offices.</P>
<P>She was a woman of honour, and would

<P>THE hours pa&s;&s;ed heavily on with our
heroine the next three days.</P>
<P>She heard nothing of Lord Melvile; and
would not venture to make a vi&s;it, le&s;t he
&s;hould unluckily call during her ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>As the moments of expectation are not
the plea&s;ante&s;t that can be conceived, &s;he
determined, as &s;he was &s;itting at breakfa&s;t
the fourth day, to go that evening to a rout,
for which &s;he had received a card three
weeks before.</P>
<P>She re&s;olved however not to play, be|cau&s;e
&s;he had &s;carce money &s;ufficient for one
&s;take; but &s;he could no longer &s;upport her
own &s;ociety; and &s;ome &s;ort of di&s;&s;ipation
<PB N="74" REF="74">
was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to relieve
an anxiety rendered more exqui&s;ite by the
natural warmth and impatience of her tem|per.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ing for this purpo&s;e, when
her French milliner, who had ju&s;t been at
Lady Bla&s;t's, where &s;he had heard &s;ome
circum&s;tances not too favourable to our he|roine,
bur&s;t abruptly into the room, and,
with an air and manner to which Mi&s;s Vil|liers
had not been accu&s;tomed, demanded
in&s;tant payment of her bill.</P>
<P>To pay her from the &s;lender remains of
her own finances was impo&s;&s;ible; not to pay
her was di&s;traction.</P>
<P>In this tumult of her mind, hurried away
by hone&s;t pride and indignation, &s;he took a
&s;tep which that very pride would at any
other moment have infallibly prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="75">
She &s;at down, and wrote a note to Lady
Hardy, in which, after apologizing for tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ing
on her friend&s;hip, of which &s;he had
already received &s;o many &s;triking proofs, &s;he
entreated her lady&s;hip, till &s;he could order
a remittance from the country, to lend her
an hundred pounds, for which &s;he had an
unexpected and immediate occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>She added, that, being perfectly ac|quainted
with the noblene&s;s of her lady|&s;hip's
&s;entiments, &s;he knew &s;he was laying
her under a di&s;tingui&s;hed obligation by
making a reque&s;t which gave her an oppor|tunity
of evincing the &s;incerity of her re|gard,
and of tho&s;e obliging offers of &s;ervice
&s;o often repeated.</P>
<P>She ob&s;erved further, that this reque&s;t
was the &s;tronge&s;t mark &s;he could give of her
e&s;teem for her lady&s;hip's amiable virtues;
and concluded by reminding her, that,
<PB N="76" REF="76">
among&s;t real friends, the greate&s;t delicacy,
in points of this nature, con&s;i&s;ted in having
no delicacy at all.</P>
<P>At the moment when Lady Hardy re|ceived
this &s;entimental epi&s;tle, &s;he was deli|berating
with her&s;elf whether to &s;upport
Mi&s;s Villiers, and enter a caveat again&s;t
Lady Bla&s;t's whole proceeding; or ab&s;o|lutely
to give up her acquaintance, and ac|quie&s;ce
in the &s;entence of the venerable
court of dowagers.</P>
<P>In other words, &s;he was balancing in her
own mind the arguments for and again&s;t our
heroine's ever becoming Lady Melvile.</P>
<P>This letter removed every &s;hadow of
doubt, and operated like magic in making
the unfavourable &s;cale preponderate.</P>
<P>She called up Mi&s;s Villiers's new foot|man,

had been recommended by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Pray, Harry, is your lady out of her

<P>He fini&s;hed his narrative by informing
her lady&s;hip, that though he had no doubt
of Mi&s;s Villiers's having been kept by Lord
Melvile, yet he was inclined to believe the
affair was entirely over, and that his lord|&s;hip

reflections on an adventure with which he
had had &s;o much rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>

was jealous of the &s;trange gentleman,

the reply valiant, &startq;That he did
<PB N="81" REF="81">
not care how &s;oon:&endq; the bell was rung
for John, who was ordered to pay him the
little wages due, and to di&s;charge him.</P>
<P>This extraordinary &s;cene did not add to
the civility of the French milliner.</P>
<P>She renewed her &s;olicitation in pretty
lively terms, and Mi&s;s Villiers was reduced
to the mortifying nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring her to
call for her money the next morning; to
which, with a good deal of murmuring, &s;he
con&s;ented.</P>
<P>The next morning? And how was the
next morning to furni&s;h her with the means
of keeping this indi&s;creet promi&s;e?</P>
<P>Lady Hardy&mdash;a thou&s;and things might
happen&mdash;What thou&s;and? Her uncle&mdash;but
could &s;he procure it from her uncle the next

&s;he wrung from him his reluctant con&s;ent to

<P>She was however convinced &s;he &s;hould
get the money in time, though it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to divine how.</P>
<P>A thought &s;tarted; this rout&mdash;&s;he had
&s;till twenty pounds remaining; &s;he owed the

was determined to try&mdash;</P>
<P>This was a <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> re&s;ource; &s;he de&s;ired
no more; her &s;anguine temper elevated it
to a <HI>certain</HI> one.</P>
<P>She might even gain a much larger &s;um:
&s;he might be enabled to pay all &s;he owed:
&s;he had &s;een people win a va&s;t deal more at
guinea quadrille, at which &s;he determined
to engage.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="83">
She dre&s;t, and went to Mrs. Harwood's

<P>The lady of the hou&s;e, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by

Hardy and Lady Bla&s;t, the former of whom
had ju&s;t been apologizing for having ever
introduced <HI>this little adventurer</HI> (&s;o &s;he
&s;tiled her), to her acquaintance, received
her with a cold con&s;trained civility, which
a mind le&s;s ardent than hers would have
&s;een in a moment.</P>
<P>Warm, un&s;u&s;pecting, a little vain, and
ju&s;tly con&s;cious of having a right to tho&s;e
unmeaning, yet agreeable, attentions which
con&s;titute the bond of mixed &s;ociety, &s;he
had not an idea of their being omitted in
her regard; the omi&s;&s;ion therefore mu&s;t
have been glaring indeed, if &s;he had ob|&s;erved
it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="84">
Nor was Mrs. Harwood, who was a
woman of great good-nature, capable of
&s;hocking any per&s;on who was her gue&s;t;
and, though &s;he determined, in what &s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed ju&s;tice to her&s;elf, never to give
Mi&s;s Villiers another invitation, yet &s;he hu|manely
re&s;olved to drop her acquaintance
in the quiete&s;t and mo&s;t imperceptible man|ner
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As Maria pa&s;&s;ed through the apartments,
&s;he &s;aw &s;everal ladies at who&s;e hou&s;es &s;he
had vi&s;ited with Lady Hardy; one or two
half returned her curt&s;y; but the greater
part looked full in her face, without be|traying
the &s;malle&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having
ever &s;een her before.</P>
<P>She was a&s;toni&s;hed how to account for
this general want of memory in the ladies,
when, turning her head, &s;he ob&s;erved Lady
Hardy and Lady Bla&s;t in clo&s;e con&s;ultation,
<PB N="85" REF="85">
in a part of the room which &s;he could not
avoid pa&s;&s;ing by, in order to enter the
next.</P>
<P>Lady Hardy held a paper in her hand,
which &s;he was reading in a low voice to
Lady Bla&s;t, and which &s;eemed to afford infi|nite
entertainment to this amiable pair.</P>
<P>On approaching them, Mi&s;s Villiers, to
her great a&s;toni&s;hment, di&s;covered the paper,
which had &s;o much amu&s;ed them, to be her
own letter to Lady Hardy, reque&s;ting her to
lend her an hundred pounds.</P>
<P>She now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw Lady
Hardy in the light &s;he merited; and, trem|bling
with &s;urprize and re&s;entment, was
going to expre&s;s her &s;en&s;e of this infamous
treatment with the &s;pirit it de&s;erved, when
both ladies turned full upon her, bur&s;t into
a loud laugh, and, bru&s;hing rudely by her,
retired into the inner apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="86">
This in&s;olence, in which nothing but the
mo&s;t abandoned effrontery could have &s;up|ported
them, was more than the lovely
victim of their malevolence could bear.</P>
<P>She had, however, the courage to re|pre&s;s
the almo&s;t &s;tarting tear, to &s;truggle
with the ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion which agitated her
whole frame, and to a&s;&s;ume an appearance
of tranquillity which ill-&s;uited the tumul|tuous
emotions of her heart.</P>
<P>She felt the in&s;ult &s;trongly, but &s;he felt
it with dignity. She approached Mrs.
Harwood, and, with an air which was within
an atom of haughtine&s;s, related the affront
&s;he had received, and from whom.</P>
<P>She added, that &s;he had entered Mrs.
Harwood's hou&s;e, relying on that protection
from outrage which politene&s;s and ho&s;pita|lity
demanded, and to which both her birth
<PB N="87" REF="87">
and character gave her a right; that this
right had been violated by two per&s;ons
who&s;e pre&s;ence, after &s;uch behaviour, di&s;|honoured
every circle in which they ap|peared,
and that &s;he mu&s;t that moment
either give up her acquaintance or theirs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Harwood's heart was for our he|roine;
but her fears enrolled her in the
contrary party.</P>
<P>She dreaded tho&s;e envenomed tongues,
from which no innocence was &s;ecure; and
had the unpardonable weakne&s;s, in&s;tead of
&s;upporting her own honour, which was
wounded by this &s;hameful treatment of one
who, as her gue&s;t, had a right to her pro|tection,
to tell Mi&s;s Villiers, though in the
&s;ofte&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s
of her own conduct, but not of hers.</P>
<P>Maria &s;aw, and pitied, her pu&s;illanimity;
and, without making any an&s;wer, retired
<PB N="88" REF="88">
with an air of maje&s;tic di&s;dain, which almo&s;t
awed &s;lander it&s;elf into &s;ilence.</P>
<P>She returned home, her heart &s;welling
with hone&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>She &s;at down; &s;he reflected on the un|merited
in&s;ult &s;he had received, and on its
probable con&s;equences; &s;he &s;aw her &s;itua|tion
in its true colours.</P>
<P>She had expended the money &s;he brought
to town, &s;he had incurred debts which &s;he
knew not how to pay.</P>
<P>Even the wretched hope of relieving the
di&s;tre&s;s of the moment by play, a re&s;ource
equally infamous and uncertain, was at an
end.</P>
<P>She &s;aw her&s;elf, &s;he knew not why, driven
from the &s;ociety in which &s;he had lived
&s;ince her coming to town, and this in a
<PB N="89" REF="89">
manner the mo&s;t humiliating that the
keene&s;t malice could have contrived.</P>
<P>The French milliner, who had pre&s;t her
&s;o rudely for money, was to call the next
morning.</P>
<P>She was unable to &s;atisfy her; &s;he had
every thing mortifying to expect from her
re&s;entment on being di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>She had to &s;uffer, what was much wor&s;e,
the reproaches of her own heart, and the
painful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having broken her
word.</P>
<P>The tears, which &s;he had hitherto re|&s;trained,
now forced their way, and gave
&s;ome relief to the agonizing &s;en&s;ations of
her &s;oul.</P>
<P>The tide of blended pa&s;&s;ions, by degrees,
&s;ub&s;ided; &s;he &s;aw the in&s;ult &s;he had re|ceived,
<PB N="90" REF="90">
and the per&s;ons who had offered it,
with the contempt they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Her pecuniary di&s;tre&s;s was of a more
alarming nature; but even there, if &s;he
could gain a little time, &s;he had &s;till a va|riety
of re&s;ources.</P>
<P>Her mind, recovering its natural tone,
became every moment more tranquil and
collected.</P>
<P>She ranged the whole expan&s;ive region
of indulgent fancy for &s;ubjects of con&s;ola|tion;
nor did &s;he range that expan&s;ive re|gion
in vain.</P>
<P>The &s;torm indeed was gathering round
her, but &s;he &s;aw it unappalled.</P>

<P><PB N="93" REF="93">
A&s;toni&s;hment and joy rendered her mo|tionle&s;s.</P>

<P>ON returning home on Tue&s;day night

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the breakfa&s;t was fini&s;hed, and
the &s;ervants had retired, Lord Clare|mont
entered on the intended &s;ubject of this
conference, the important bu&s;ine&s;s of Do|rignon's
abdication.</P>
<P>&startq;You cannot conceive, my dear Melvile,
how much I value my&s;elf on this nego|tiation;
which, give me leave to &s;ay, re|quired
fifty times more dexterity than a
treaty between two crowned heads.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Having fir&s;t made Dorignon the confi|dante
of your intended marriage, and con|vinced
<PB N="99" REF="99">
her that &s;he had nothing to expect
in future from your attachment, I car|ried
my point, by flattering her with the
hope of marrying our We&s;t Indian.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This hope I am not clear &s;he will not
be able to reduce to certainty; at lea&s;t
if &s;he &s;teadily pur&s;ues the plan I have
taken the pains to trace out for her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is, you well know, ju&s;t arrived
from one of the mo&s;t uncivilized and bar|barous
of our We&s;t India I&s;lands, and
knows about as much of the world as a
country &s;chool-boy of thirteen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have regulated all Dorignon's future
mea&s;ures by the exacte&s;t &s;cales of &s;ound
policy and knowledge of mankind.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e propo&s;ed mea&s;ures are as much
calculated for her advantage as your
<PB N="100" REF="100">
&s;afety, though the latter was undoubt|edly
my fir&s;t principle of action.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is, by my intervention, &s;ecured in
a very liberal allowance from this young
man; and I have, unknown to him, pre|&s;ented
her, in your name, with three hun|dred
guineas for her <HI>menus plai&s;irs.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;They are to go abroad immediately;
not to France, becau&s;e there &s;he is rather
too well known.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not to Italy, becau&s;e the Italian women
are as amu&s;ing, and ten thou&s;and times
hand&s;omer than her&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But they are to make the tour of the
Northern courts, where the cards will be
almo&s;t played into her hands.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;She de&s;ired to &s;ee you before &s;he &s;et

<P>&startq;My chai&s;e will be at the door in half

<P>THEY &s;et out, and reached Mrs. Har|ding's

The ladies, that is to &s;ay, Mrs. Harding,
and her daughter, the de&s;tined Lady Mel|vile,
were in the dre&s;&s;ing-room of the lat|ter,
who was at her harp&s;ichord when her
noble vi&s;itants arrived.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile entered the hou&s;e with a
reluctance which he was &s;carce able to con|ceal.</P>
<P>As he had heard nothing of his bride
from Lord Claremont, but that &s;he was
rich, he had formed to him&s;elf an idea of
her the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing that can be con|ceived.</P>
<P>His imagination had painted her in the
mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting colours; and he had only
reconciled him&s;elf to the marriage by con|&s;idering
the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;tep to
the emancipation of the family e&s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="104">
Full of the idea that the woman one mar|ries

uneducated; in &s;hort, a chemical compound
of every &s;pecies of imperfection.</P>
<P>If &s;he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any uncommon ad|vantages,

Claremont would naturally have mentioned

<P>Judge then of his a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing,
in a <HI>de&s;habille</HI> as elegantly fancied as his

well made; a brunette, but of the

<P>Lord Melvile, from the information of
the harp&s;ichord, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k

<P>She made this di&s;covery with the greater
facility, as it was the &s;ide on which &s;he was
her&s;elf mo&s;t peculiarly vulnerable.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="107">
Without departing from what &s;he owed
to her&s;elf, &s;he behaved to him with that in|&s;inuating,
yet almo&s;t imperceptible atten|tion,
which &s;upplies the place of every
other &s;pecies of merit, where every other
&s;pecies of merit is wanting.</P>
<P>This was however far from being the
ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance.</P>
<P>She had, both from the gifts of nature
and tho&s;e of education, an undoubted right
to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>She had at lea&s;t her &s;hare both of mental
and per&s;onal perfections.</P>
<P>She had an agreeable figure, an excellent
under&s;tanding, a thou&s;and &s;triking fa&s;hion|able
accompli&s;hments, and, above all, had
&s;acrificed largely to the Graces.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="108">
But the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s enchantment by which
&s;he propo&s;ed to bind Lord Melvile in &s;ilken
fetters, was not the power of her own at|tractions,
but the lively &s;en&s;e &s;he &s;hould ap|pear
to have of his.</P>
<P>For her &s;ucce&s;s in this attack on the heart
of Lord Melvile, there were many very im|portant
rea&s;ons to be given, which we will
particularize in the next Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>SETTING a&s;ide the <HI>agremens</HI> of his
intended bride, &s;he could not have
found a more favourable interval in which
to &s;educe his inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="109">
He had lo&s;t Dorignon, and was piqued
at the equivocal conduct and &s;uppo&s;ed du|plicity
of the lovely Maria.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harding had be&s;ides every external
advantage over her rivals which her father's
almo&s;t princely fortune could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>It was not a French opera-girl, a woman
of abandoned character, &s;upported by his
infatuation; it was not a little unknown ad|venturer,
in a hired lodging, who now &s;oli|cited
his attention; but the heire&s;s of im|men&s;e
wealth, who&s;e attachment mu&s;t there|fore
nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;incere.</P>
<P>Her dre&s;s, her blaze of diamonds, her
apartment, her attendants, all &s;poke rather
an A&s;iatic queen than the daughter of an
Engli&s;h private gentleman.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was noble, and furni&s;hed with
all the &s;plendour of Ea&s;tern magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="110">
The table was &s;erved in the mo&s;t &s;uperb
&s;tyle, and covered with every co&s;tly delicacy
of every land, and almo&s;t of every &s;ea&s;on;
with a profu&s;ion of blended French and
Oriental luxury.</P>
<P>Excellent mu&s;ic, amu&s;ing company, dan|cing,
high play, the latter of which Lord
Melvile pa&s;&s;ionately loved, made the hours
pa&s;s away on rapid pinions.</P>
<P>But among&s;t all Mi&s;s Harding's auxilia|ries
in her conque&s;t of Lord Melvile, none
was more powerful in its effects than &s;ur|prize.</P>
<P>Lord Claremont, who knew the effect of
a <HI>coup de main,</HI> had intentionally bounded
his prai&s;es to the myriads Mi&s;s Harding was
to bring with her to her hu&s;band, without
hinting at her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one &s;ingle attrac|tive
quality be&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="111">
The event ju&s;tified this precaution.</P>
<P>Had Lord Melvile been told &s;he was a
pretty woman, very accompli&s;hed, and that
&s;he &s;ung like an angel, he would have
found her a pretty woman, very accom|pli&s;hed,
and who &s;ung like an angel; but
no more.</P>
<P>Contra&s;ted with the unplea&s;ing idea he
had formed of her in con&s;equence of his fa|ther's
affected &s;ilence on the &s;ubject, &s;he
appeared to him almo&s;t a divinity.</P>
<P>His imagination was dazzled; he forgot
Mi&s;s Villiers, or remembered her only to
feel him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed by the recollection.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this &s;tar of the Ea&s;t had, ere
four days had fully elap&s;ed, by flattering
his &s;elf-love, and leading him through a
round of the mo&s;t animated amu&s;ements,
<PB N="112" REF="112">
convinced him of the ab&s;urdity of his pro|jected
arrangement with Mi&s;s Villiers, and
determined him to put a &s;top to the treaty.</P>
<P>&startq;Why keep, and at a heavy expence, a
mi&s;tre&s;s who threatened, from her tire&s;ome
affectation of &s;entiment, to be as <HI>ennuieu&s;e</HI>
as a wife; when a wife was happily &s;elected
for him by a father he wi&s;hed to oblige,
who, be&s;ides bringing great riches into the
family, promi&s;ed, from her talents and <HI>en|jo&ucirc;ement,</HI>
to be as amu&s;ing as a mi&s;tre&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Many a man of fa&s;hion had married the

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>HE communicated this idea to Lord

fini&s;hed, and was beyond mea&s;ure plea&s;ed
with a plan which promi&s;ed many family

<P>Lord Melvile proceeded to inform his
indulgent parent of his &s;ituation in re&s;pect
to Mi&s;s Villiers, and of the offers he was
proceeding to make her, when the extraor|dinary
adventure of the &s;tranger threw a

<P><PB N="114" REF="114">
He de&s;ired his lord&s;hip's opinion and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance

<P>Lord Claremont kindly undertook the

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a con&s;ultation in what man|ner
to conduct this delicate affair,
without wounding either humanity or <HI>bien|&s;eance,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="115">
it was &s;ettled that Lord Melvile
&s;hould continue a few days longer at Har|ding-Place,
where a ma&s;querade was fixed
for the following Monday; and that Lord

pay Mi&s;s Villiers a vi&s;it, and employ all his
knowledge of the human heart, as well to
di&s;cover her true character, as to lead her
gently to the point of breaking off this idle
connexion.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile begged his father to &s;often
the blow, as well by &s;ome act of genero&s;ity
like that he had &s;hown to Dorignon, as by
every &s;oothing art in the power of man to
employ.</P>
<P>He intreated his lord&s;hip to be particu|larly

<P>Lord Claremont &s;miled rather &s;arca&s;ti|cally
at his &s;on's apprehen&s;ions on this head,

<P>WE &s;hould have ob&s;erved in the la&s;t

admiration of our heroine, from which a ray
of light had darted on the mind of Lord

The idea of di&s;po&s;ing advantageou&s;ly of

not the lea&s;t doubt that Lord Mel|vile's

of the &s;ame intimate kind as that with Do|rignon
(though Lord Melvile had a&s;&s;ured
him of the contrary), he re&s;olved on &s;eeing
her Lady Wat&s;on, and in the mean time on
&s;upporting her in the &s;ituation, whatever
that &s;hould be, in which his &s;on, as he &s;up|po&s;ed,
had already placed her.</P>
<P>As he had heard the &s;tory very imper|fectly,

as Virgil on the geography of his immortal

of his addre&s;s, for he was one of the be&s;t|bred
men in the world, di&s;pelled in five mi|nutes
<PB N="123" REF="121">
all the apprehen&s;ions to which &s;he had
given way before his appearance.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip was not only one of the be&s;t|bred,
but one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men in
town; and though con&s;iderably pa&s;t fifty,
might have pa&s;&s;ed for about thirty-eight.</P>
<P>He had beyond mo&s;t men, the happy art
of rendering him&s;elf agreeable to others,
by putting them in good humour with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>He practi&s;ed this art with &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s

Mi&s;s Villiers, that &s;he found her&s;elf inclined
to have as implicit a confidence in him, as
&s;he could have had in Col. Dormer had he
been pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When, by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t delicate
and well-directed flattery, he had brought
her mind to the very &s;tate he wi&s;hed, he
<PB N="124" REF="122">
proceeded to communicate, but by the gen|tle&s;t
gradations, the motives of his vi&s;it, and
his ideas in re&s;pect to her future conduct.</P>
<P>&startq;Will you, madam, pardon the liberty
I take, when I tell you, you are the mo&s;t
lovely woman I ever beheld?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have every thing to expect from
&s;uch a profu&s;ion of charms, but you do
not appear to know the u&s;e of them; and
want a friend to conduct you through the
devious path of life.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In me behold that friend; command
my utmo&s;t &s;ervices, and open your whole
heart to me without re&s;erve.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Depend on my cares to place you in
the &s;ituation to which your beauty gives
you the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible right to pretend;
but fir&s;t tell me, with that amiable &s;ince|rity
which is &s;o vi&s;ibly painted on your
<PB N="125" REF="123">
countenance, what is really the nature of
your pre&s;ent connexion with Lord Mel|vile.&endq;</P>
<P>The vivid crim&s;on on the cheek of Maria,
who was equally charmed and embarra&s;&s;ed
by a conver&s;ation which &s;eemed to lead to
all &s;he wi&s;hed; and the faltering of her
voice when &s;he attempted, but in vain, to
make a reply, confirmed his lord&s;hip beyond
the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt in his very proba|ble
conjecture in re&s;pect to their pre&s;ent in|tercour&s;e.</P>
<P>He therefore proceeded on that &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
and, willing to &s;pare her confu&s;ion,
continued his harangue without waiting for
an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>After telling her he was &s;orry &s;o tender
an intercour&s;e &s;hould be &s;o &s;oon interrupted,

been to have made a &s;ettlement on her for
<PB N="126" REF="124">
life, and to have continued her the mi&s;tre&s;s
of his heart, though family con&s;iderations
obliged him to give his hand to another.</P>
<P>He begged her to be a&s;&s;ured of the &s;in|cerity
of Lord Melvile's attachment, and of
the extreme difficulty he had found in con|vincing
him of the imprudence of the &s;tep
into which his pa&s;&s;ion for her had almo&s;t
&s;educed him.</P>
<P>He added, that as Lord Melvile's mar|riage
with Mi&s;s Harding, which was to take
place in a few days, would render the con|tinuance
of their connexion highly impro|per,
it was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
put an end to it, whatever regret &s;uch a &s;a|crifice
might cau&s;e Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>That, thus circum&s;tanced, and compelled

him&s;elf &s;uch happine&s;s in pur&s;uing, Lord

that no time &s;hould ever obliterate the re|membrance

&s;eemed unable to reply, and imagining the
a&s;&s;iduity of a new lover the mo&s;t effectual
con&s;olation for the neglect of an old one, he
proceeded to inform her of the conque&s;t &s;he
had made of Sir Charles Wat&s;on.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured her, as his opinion, that this
young man, who knew much le&s;s of the
world than Lord Melvile, might even be
brought in time, if &s;he played her cards
well, to change the ro&s;y fetters of illicit
Love, for the more durable and more re|&s;pectable
ones of Hymen.</P>

give a &s;upper, of which you &s;hall be the

<P>He he&s;itated, and was at a lo&s;s in what
manner to proceed, when, having recol|lected
her&s;elf, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed him in the fol|lowing

<P>&startq;I am too &s;incere, my lord, to di&s;&s;emble;

<P>&startq;Both Lord Melvile and my&s;elf have
been mi&s;taken: I, in imagining him a
man of honour; he, in &s;uppo&s;ing me a
woman devoted to infamy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am above di&s;gui&s;e, my lord; I will
not deny that I have loved Lord Melvile;
or rather, that I have loved the beautiful
idol of my own creation, the ideal, the
all-perfect Lord Melvile, who no longer
exi&s;ts but in the traces of my deluded

I am incoherent, my lord, but
it is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e at

<P>&startq;I do not condemn Lord Melvile; every

thinking.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am unknown to you, my lord, which
is your only excu&s;e for what I have ju&s;t

re&s;pect a woman who&s;e family is not in|ferior
to your own, who&s;e virtues do not

this in&s;tance has been owing only to her
youth, her inexperience of the depravity

her &s;ea&s;on of life.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps I am, however, &s;till more cul|pable,

After having apologized politely for what

<P>AFTER a tour round the garden, a

chat on the &s;ubject of old college
adventures; Col. Dormer, having fir&s;t ob|tained
Mr. Hammond's promi&s;e of &s;pend|ing
a few days at Belfont, pre&s;ented him to
the bright Loui&s;a, who appeared to him
only le&s;s charming than her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>For that &s;i&s;ter the good old man felt an
enthu&s;ia&s;tic partiality, which, had he been
<PB N="172" REF="169">
younger, would have amounted to a pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>He regarded Loui&s;a with admiration;
&s;he was, he acknowledged, lovely&mdash;But
Maria&mdash;</P>
<P>Loui&s;a had the fine&s;t blue eyes in the

<P>Maria's were eyes indeed&mdash;eyes informed
by the radiant blaze of genius&mdash;</P>
<P>The vivid glow of her complexion&mdash;the

</LG>
<PB N="173" REF="170">
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed a chearful evening, and re|tired
early to bed, in favour of Mr. Ham|mond's
fatigue.</P>
<P>He &s;lept little during the fir&s;t part of the

which occa&s;ioned his journey.</P>
<P>He found a thou&s;and difficulties in re&s;pect
to the manner in which he &s;hould enter on
the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Villiers's &s;ituation.</P>
<P>He might have &s;aid, with more propriety,
her <HI>indi&s;cretion,</HI> but he would not even allow
that &s;he was indi&s;creet.</P>
<P>He called her profu&s;ion the ebullition of
a noble mind; and found merit even in that
heedle&s;s inattention to forms which threat|ened
&s;uch dreadful con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="171">
He at la&s;t determined, as he intended &s;tay|ing
two or three days, to tru&s;t to the chap|ter
of accidents, and only be on the watch
to find a favourable moment.</P>
<P>He could not, even in this &s;hort inter|cour&s;e,
have mi&s;&s;ed Col. Dormer's prevail|ing
pa&s;&s;ion; and rightly judged that a mild
vernal &s;hower, or the blowing of a new
auricula, might have the be&s;t effect po&s;&s;ible
on the mind of his friend.</P>
<P>The morning being uncommonly fine, the
carriages were ordered to the door at eleven.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer propo&s;ed to give Mr. Ham|mond
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Burghley, the
celebrated &s;eat of the &s;till more celebrated
&s;tate&s;man who&s;e name it bears, from whence
Belfont was di&s;tant only a few miles.</P>
<P>To Burghley therefore they proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="172">
As a lover of the imitative arts, Mr. Ham|mond
was charmed with &s;eeing the noble
works of the divine ma&s;ters with which this
magnificent &s;eat is ornamented and en|riched.</P>
<P>But he felt (as a patriot worthy of the
name) a much &s;ublimer plea&s;ure in calling
to remembrance the public virtues of the
great, the wi&s;e, the uncorrupt, mini&s;ter,
who rai&s;ed the glory of his country to its
utmo&s;t &s;ummit.</P>
<P>He regarded his portrait with reverential
delight.</P>
<P>He fancied he &s;aw his venerable &s;hade in
every apartment through which he was con|ducted.</P>
<P>Our party returned to Belfont, but not
alone.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="173">
They met in the avenue, within a few
paces of the hou&s;e, Mr. Montague, the ru|ral
philo&s;opher of whom we have &s;poken
before, as lord of the manor of Belfont.</P>
<P>He was coming on a vi&s;it to the benevo|lent
ma&s;ter of this &s;uperb man&s;ion, who was
however, at this time, ab&s;ent in London.</P>
<P>His &s;on, the object that had reconciled
Loui&s;a to &s;hades and &s;olitude, and whom
our little family &s;uppo&s;ed to be attending
his &s;tudies at Cambridge, was with him.</P>
<P>They were both on hor&s;eback, and both
&s;topped on &s;eeing Col. Dormer's carriage.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague the younger had been ill
of a fever at college, and had been &s;ent
home (where he arrived the evening before)
for change of air, by his phy&s;icians.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="174">
His illne&s;s had left a palene&s;s which only
rendered his countenance, if po&s;&s;ible, more
intere&s;ting than ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond was &s;truck with a face &s;o
full of expre&s;&s;ion, and was going to a&s;k his
name, when he approached the chai&s;e in
which the good old man was with the lovely
Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing the object of her tendere&s;t af|fection
in a manner thus unhoped and unex|pected,
the cheek of Loui&s;a became &s;uffu&s;ed
with the livelie&s;t crim&s;on; her heart beat
thick, her voice faltered, and her repeated
attempts to &s;peak terminated in broken and
inarticulate accents.</P>
<P>By a movement, not only involuntary,
but unknown at the time to her&s;elf, &s;he,
with a trembling hand, let down the gla&s;s
of the carriage at Mr. Montague's ap|proach.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="175">
He addre&s;&s;ed her with an emotion which,
though perhaps favourable to his beauty,
was far from being &s;o to his elocution.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion, the agitation, the plea&s;ure
vi&s;ible in the countenances of both, were
too perceptible to e&s;cape Mr. Hammond's
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Their looks were &s;ufficiently intelligible
to &s;tand in no need of an hi&s;torian to inform
him of the &s;ituation of their hearts.</P>
<P>He now thought Loui&s;a as hand&s;ome as
her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>She had lo&s;t that air of &s;till-life which
had at fir&s;t &s;ight extremely di&s;plea&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Her blue eyes were become lovely by
being impa&s;&s;ioned.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="176">
In &s;hort &s;he appeared to him another
being; &s;o much does beauty depend on
animation.</P>
<P>She was no longer a faultle&s;s &s;tatue, but
an enchanting woman; an object, not merely
of admiration, but of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague left his &s;on by the &s;ide of
Mi&s;s Villiers's chai&s;e, and, giving his hor&s;e
to a &s;ervant, returned to Belfont in that of
Col. Dormer.</P>
<P>The party &s;eparated at Mr. Montague's
door, who invited him&s;elf, and his family,
con&s;i&s;ting of this &s;on, and a very amiable
daughter, to &s;pend the afternoon at Col.
Dormer's.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we la&s;t &s;et out for London,
we left Mr. Montague the younger
at Col. Dormer's gate, where he arrived in
the intention of explaining him&s;elf in the
cleare&s;t terms to Loui&s;a on the &s;ubject of his
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution we have ob&s;erved had
been a little precipitated by the report that
a man of great fortune had made propo&s;als
to Col. Dormer for his niece; which report,
however, happened not to be true.</P>
<P>As minute details of conver&s;ation between
lovers are much more intere&s;ting to the par|ties
concerned than to anybody el&s;e, we
&s;hall wave particulars, and only &s;ay, that
Mr. Montague was not di&s;&s;atisfied with the
interview; and that during the three weeks
<PB N="181" REF="178">
of his &s;tay at Belfont, for he went to college
a week &s;ooner than he intended, he had
brought her to promi&s;e never to marry any
other man, though &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing
to enter into any po&s;itive engagement with
him, unle&s;s with his father's mo&s;t perfect
approbation.</P>
<P>He went to Cambridge &s;atisfied in &s;ome
degree with this promi&s;e, and determined
to write the &s;tate of his heart to his father.</P>
<P>He was, however, prevented by a fit of
illne&s;s, brought on by his fears that Mr.
Montague, indulgent as he was, would not
approve an alliance in which intere&s;t had &s;o
little &s;hare.</P>
<P>He had forgot that this excellent father
was a philo&s;opher in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e
of the word; and that, &s;etting his philo&s;o|phy
a&s;ide, his very prejudices would in this
in&s;tance be in his favour.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="179">
In &s;hort, he was not, though he ought to
have been, exempt from the baneful error
of young people, in &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible
they can have any friend half as much in|tere&s;ted
in their happine&s;s as a parent.</P>
<P>He wrote, however, to his &s;i&s;ter, who had
always been the confidante of his pa&s;&s;ion,
and told her his determination to a&s;k his
father's permi&s;&s;ion to marry Mi&s;s Villiers,
as &s;oon as he &s;hould return to Belfont.</P>
<P>On hearing of his illne&s;s, alarmed for his
life, Mi&s;s Montague di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret to
her father, who had ordered his carriage to
be ready in the morning, in the intention
of going him&s;elf to fetch him from Cam|bridge,
when he arrived in a po&s;t-chai&s;e at
the door.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague, who thought happine&s;s
the fir&s;t object of every rational being, and
<PB N="183" REF="180">
knew it did not depend on wealth, was per|fectly
&s;atisfied with the choice his &s;on had
made; but as marriage is a &s;tep there is no
retrieving, he was anxious to be clearly in|formed
as to the inclinations of the young
lady, before he took any mea&s;ure prepara|tory
to a union, to which, &s;uppo&s;ing their
attachment mutual, he had not the &s;hadow
of an objection.</P>
<P>The ride of this morning had, acciden|tally,
&s;aved him much trouble on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>He had ob&s;erved the countenance of Mi&s;s
Villiers, on his &s;on's approach, with the
mo&s;t &s;crutinizing eye, and had not a doubt
remaining.</P>
<P>In the full conviction that the future feli|city
of both depended on their union, he
had taken his place in Col. Dormer's chai&s;e,
and had a&s;ked his con&s;ent to pre&s;ent his &s;on
<PB N="184" REF="181">
to Mi&s;s Villiers in the afternoon, as a can|didate
for the honour of her hand.</P>
<P>There was but one point in which the&s;e
two excellent men had di&s;agreed.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer was for deferring the mar|riage
two or three years longer, and Mr.
Montague for concluding it immediately.</P>
<P>When the former had exhau&s;ted all his
arguments, which Mr. Montague heard
with more patience than he was accu&s;tomed
to &s;how when contradicted, he made the fol|lowing
reply:</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot, my good friend, account for
your arguing &s;o unphilo&s;ophically, on any
principle except that of your &s;uppo&s;ing a
little a&s;&s;umed reluctance becomes you, as
&s;tanding in the place of the young lady.&endq;</P>

&startq;But let me entreat you to lay a&s;ide your
coyne&s;s for a moment, and talk like a rea|&s;onable

<P>&startq;My &s;on's happine&s;s depends on his
being united with Mi&s;s Villiers; and let
me, with the pardonable pride of a pa|rent,
add, that the qualities of his heart
promi&s;e that the happine&s;s con&s;equent on
this union will be reciprocal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You and I, by keeping in the formal
beaten track, may po&s;tpone the aera of

<P>&startq;I have not the lea&s;t objection to his
keeping the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;idence till that
time, which is not very di&s;tant: but I &s;ee

account, as he is not a candidate for a

<P>&startq;As to foreign travel, I am in this re|&s;pect

<P>&startq;A young antiquarian is every way a
&s;oloeci&s;m.&endq;</P>

in&s;tantly knew it to be that of Lady Bla&s;t.</P>
<P>Afraid of tru&s;ting &s;o dark a tran&s;action

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning after Mr. Hammond
had &s;et out for Belfont, Mi&s;s Villiers,
though the knew not half her danger, had
ri&s;en in a &s;tate of mind which Lady Bla&s;t
her&s;elf would almo&s;t have pitied.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="197">
She &s;aw the precipice on the borders of
which &s;he &s;tood, though &s;he &s;aw it not in all
its horrors.</P>
<P>She knew not Lady Bla&s;t's inventive ge|nius,
nor did &s;he know her&s;elf the object of
her malice.</P>
<P>She &s;aw di&s;appointment, &s;he &s;aw di&s;tre&s;s,
before her; but &s;he had not the remote&s;t
apprehen&s;ion of infamy.</P>
<P>She knew not the blow now levelled at
her &s;ame.</P>
<P>She knew not that the &s;troke, if given,
would probably be fatal; that the wounds
of calumny are never perfectly healed.</P>
<P>The human mind, impelled by its own
re&s;tle&s;s nature, fond of the marvellous, and
ever &s;eeking food for that curio&s;ity which
<PB N="201" REF="198">
carries us to &s;o much good and &s;o much
evil, imbibes with eagerne&s;s the animated
tale of &s;lander, becau&s;e animated.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate its truth, to withdraw the
veil which covers a well-invented fal&s;ehood,
requires a cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate exertion of the
under&s;tanding, a patience of enquiry, to
which few, not per&s;onally intere&s;ted, will
&s;ubmit.</P>
<P>It is an effort, and from all effort the mind
of man naturally flies.</P>
<P>Infatuated girl! Why did &s;he leave her
hou&s;ehold gods?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e hou&s;ehold gods are alone the cer|tain
guardians of female honour.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid, her quick &s;en&s;ibility of the
<HI>becoming,</HI> had prevented her writing, <HI>on
Monday,</HI> to Lord Melvile.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="199">
That &s;en&s;ibility gave way, <HI>on Tue&s;day,</HI> to
the augu&s;t idea of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Lord Melvile had a <HI>right</HI> to be heard in
his own defence.</P>
<P>After re&s;olving, doubting, re-re&s;olving,
an hundred times, &s;he &s;at down, and wrote
him a letter full of confidence and &s;enti|ment.</P>
<P>&startq;What incon&s;i&s;tency!&endq; It is true, but
the human heart <HI>is</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>She owned her tenderne&s;s; a tenderne&s;s
ju&s;tified, and even rendered meritorious, by
his virtues; by virtues which it would be
profanene&s;s even to doubt.</P>
<P>She recounted, but with as much &s;often|ing
as the ca&s;e would admit, the &s;uppo&s;ed
artifices of Lord Claremont to break this
<PB N="203" REF="200">
union of two enamoured hearts; of two
hearts &s;o evidently <HI>formed for each other.</HI></P>
<P>She proceeded, like a mi&s;s educated in
&s;hades, to promi&s;e him everla&s;ting love.</P>
<P>Could &s;he do le&s;s?&mdash;He was &s;o &s;uperior
to all his &s;ex!&mdash;&startq;To her the whole uni|ver&s;e

<P>In &s;hort, &s;he ran on in the high romance
&s;tyle the length of two quarto pages, and
then di&s;patched John to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e,
with orders to deliver it to him&s;elf, if at
home, and to wait his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Her chariot, which &s;he had determined
<HI>indeed</HI> to keep only that <HI>little week</HI> (a week
could not make much difference in the ex|pence),
drove up to the door about a quar|ter
of an hour after John &s;et off; and in five
minutes was obliged to give way to another;
<PB N="204" REF="201">
which Mi&s;s Villiers took for granted was
that of Lord Melvile.</P>
<P>Intere&s;ted as &s;he was in the que&s;tion, &s;he

to the window.</P>

to be &s;till in France.</P>

<P>The friend of her heart at the moment
when a friend was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>She was breathle&s;s with joy&mdash;</P>

&startq;Not yet&mdash;But I am &s;o happy to &s;ee

<P>At this moment John entered, and in|formed
Mi&s;s Villiers, that having a&s;ked for
Lord Melvile, he was informed his lord&s;hip
was gone into the country, to the &s;eat of
his intended father-in-law, Mr. Harding,
and would not be in town till after his mar|riage.</P>
<P>His marriage!&mdash;Her mi&s;ery was then
certain&mdash;&s;he &s;unk motionle&s;s into a chair.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Villiers had too little art to hide
her feelings, and Mrs. Herbert too much
knowledge of the world to mi&s;take them,
the latter was &s;oon <HI>au fait</HI> as to the intere&s;t
her friend took in all that related to Lord
Melvile.</P>
<P>She however &s;pared her confu&s;ion, told
her &s;he looked pale, that &s;he &s;aw the town
<PB N="207" REF="204">
did not agree with her, and in&s;i&s;ted on
taking her for three or four days to the villa
of her mother-in-law, Lady Sophia Herbert,
about twenty miles from town.</P>
<P>&startq;I will &s;end off one of my &s;ervants this
moment to apprize Lady Sophia of our
intended vi&s;it, and if you plea&s;e, my dear
we will be with her at dinner to-morrow:
this day I in&s;i&s;t on your &s;pending with me:
we will be denied, and chat over all our
Rutland adventures.&endq;</P>
<P>Our heroine was too unhappy at home,
and too weary of her own &s;ociety, not to be
delighted with the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>She endeavoured to hide the emotion &s;he
could not ab&s;olutely re&s;train; and Mrs.
Herbert, who &s;aw her di&s;tre&s;s, and wi&s;hed
to give her time to recover from the &s;hock,
pretended to have vi&s;its to pay, and left her
till dinner to her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="205">
We have &s;aid Mi&s;s Villiers had a mind,
which, though full of &s;en&s;ibility, was natu|rally
carried to &s;ee every thing on the
brighte&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert's ab&s;ence was, as &s;he ima|gined
it would be, a relief to her friend.</P>
<P>She &s;at down, &s;he read the letter John

<P>No ray of hope remained as to the fir&s;t

<P><PB N="209" REF="206">
&startq;Her next novel?&endq; Is &s;he not then

<P>Alas! my friend, it is plain you have

<P>&startq;And I, my dear brother, have this

<P>Mrs. Herbert, who ob&s;erved the emotion
which he endeavoured to hide, and who at|tributed

it all to the charms of Mi&s;s Villiers,
&s;miled at his affectation of unconcern, and
a&s;&s;ured him her friend was as amiable as &s;he

<P>With a figure &s;till elegant, and a face
which wanted only the bloom of youth to
be beautiful, &s;he had an air which &s;poke
her birth to have been the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed:
an air which would have been
commanding, had not its impre&s;&s;ion been
&s;oftened by the &s;mile of undi&s;&s;embled good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her countenance &s;poke, in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ive
language, that calm &s;un&s;hine of the
&s;oul which is the happy monopoly of virtue.</P>
<P>She was perfectly well-bred, without the
remote&s;t tincture of affectation.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="218">
She had mixed in the <HI>world;</HI> but her in|clination,
and the mediocrity of her for|tune,
had pre&s;erved her from mixing in the
<HI>ton.</HI></P>
<P>Left a widow extremely young, &s;he had
devoted her whole time to the care of edu|cating
Col. Herbert, her only child, and
pointing out his road to glory, by &s;howing
him the paths marked out by his illu&s;trious
ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>He had returned her cares by meriting
them, and by a filial affection which bor|dered
on enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Mr. Herbert's e&s;tate had been inherited
by his elde&s;t &s;on, born of another mother,
the hu&s;band of Mi&s;s Villiers's friend.</P>
<P>On his death, without children, what re|mained
of the family fortune had de&s;cended
to Col. Herbert.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="219">
He received it a good deal impaired by
his brother's profu&s;ene&s;s, and by Mrs. Her|bert's
jointure.</P>
<P>He had, however, remaining about &s;even
hundred pounds a year, which he divided
with his mother, who&s;e &s;ituation was before
by no means &s;uitable to her birth, but which
this addition made perfectly ea&s;y.</P>
<P>She had remon&s;trated, but to no pur|po&s;e;
he rightly ob&s;erved, that he was a
&s;ingle man, and that whil&s;t he continued &s;o,
a hand&s;ome lodging, and a hired chariot,
were all the exteriors for which he had oc|ca&s;ion,
and that his pride was much more
intere&s;ted in her lady&s;hip's appearance than
his own.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<P>A Word or two, gentle reader, in re|&s;pect
to this young man; after which
we will leave the party at Lady Sophia's to
get acquainted, and &s;ee what is become of
Mr. Hammond.</P>
<P>Col. Herbert had entered into the army,
as we have ob&s;erved, a perfect child, where
he had acquired all the frankne&s;s and gene|ro&s;ity
of the military character; to which,
by the cares of his mother, he had added a
competent &s;hare of learning, and a particu|lar
ta&s;te for polite literature.</P>
<P>He had travelled, not in the modern
&s;tyle, under his own guidance, at nineteen,
with &s;ome needy dependent French adven|turer
as an apology for a tutor, but with a
nobleman, his near relation, who had been
<PB N="224" REF="221">
amba&s;&s;ador at one of the fir&s;t courts in
Europe.</P>
<P>He had therefore literally &s;een courts,
and had conver&s;ed, not with little Abb&eacute;s,
Pari&s;ian <HI>Gens de Loix,</HI> or the de&s;picable
beings that in France a&s;&s;ume the name of
<HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> but with the fir&s;t, the be&s;t, the
mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, per&s;ons in every coun|try
through which he accompanied Lord
L&mdash;&mdash;.</P>
<P>Too poor to be flattered, too well-born
to de&s;cend to flatter others, he had acquired
dignity of mind without vanity or pride,
and ea&s;e and attention without &s;ervility.</P>
<P>He had fine &s;en&s;e, which his natural fire,
and proper &s;elf-confidence, produced on
all occa&s;ions to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>He was open, brave, generous, &s;incere,
well-bred; and, being in perfect good-humour
<PB N="225" REF="222">
with him&s;elf, was extremely in|clined
to be &s;o with others.</P>
<P>He loved women, but he al&s;o e&s;teemed
them, becau&s;e he had been accu&s;tomed to
the &s;ociety of the mo&s;t e&s;timable; and had
be&s;ides &s;een the female character in its mo&s;t
beautiful light at home.</P>
<P>His per&s;on was rather plea&s;ing than what
is generally called hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>He was of the middle &s;tature, well-made,
ea&s;y, genteel, and had the air and deport|ment
of a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>His education, and his military life, had
given him great perfection in tho&s;e exerci&s;es
which improve the figure, and are becom|ing
a &s;oldier and a gentleman.</P>
<P>His complexion was brown, and ren|dered
browner by his profe&s;&s;ion; he had
<PB N="226" REF="223">
very fine che&s;nut hair, and the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ive
dark eyes in the world.</P>
<P>Let us leave our friends to amu&s;e them|&s;elves
by little tours about the neighbour|ing
country; to read, chat, &s;ing, dance,
play at quadrille, and be happy, whil&s;t we
return a moment to town.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a comfortable night's &s;leep,
Mr. Hammond ro&s;e, in good &s;pirits,
to receive Lady Bla&s;t's vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She came, &s;he apologized, &s;he almo&s;t
blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>He menaced, &s;he trembled, &s;he acceded
to the conditions of forgivene&s;s he propo&s;ed,
<PB N="227" REF="224">
which were, to burn her delectable manu|&s;cript,
and give the hone&s;t compo&s;itor an
hundred pounds as a &s;mall reward for hav|ing
&s;aved her the infamy of publi&s;hing &s;o
&s;hameful a libel.</P>
<P>Our heroine's fame being thus re&s;cued
from the danger which threatened it, Mr.
Hammond pleaded bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;horten Lady
Bla&s;t's vi&s;it, and went to Mrs. Merrick's;
where, finding the good woman at home,
he learned that Mi&s;s Villiers was at Lady
Sophia Herbert's in Surry, where &s;he was
to &s;tay a fortnight longer.</P>
<P>His heart glowed with plea&s;ure; half his
work was done to his hands; he was the
intimate friend and near relation of Lady
Sophia, knew her virtues, the e&s;timation in
which they &s;tood, and the importance of
the vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Villiers.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="225">
He enquired into the &s;tate of her finances,
and, venturing to act as her parent for the
time being, paid the few debts &s;he had re|maining,
di&s;charged her lodging and her
chariot, wrote to Col. Dormer that &s;he was
in the country on a vi&s;it to the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable
woman in the world, where he
intended to join the party, and, attended by
Mi&s;s Villiers's faithful old John, who had
been left behind, &s;et out for Lady Sophia's
villa.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome people who have
the happy art of gaining, not only
your friend&s;hip, but your confidence, in a
moment.</P>
<P>Col. Herbert was one of the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="226">
Warm, &s;incere, open, undi&s;gui&s;ed him|&s;elf,
it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have di&s;|gui&s;e
with him.</P>
<P>He had made it a point to gain the
e&s;teem and confidence of Mi&s;s Villiers, and
had &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing five or &s;ix delightful days
at Greenwood, in that &s;weet &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e
of congenial minds which wants a
name, &s;he had taken courage, as they were
walking in the garden together, whil&s;t the
two ladies were paying a vi&s;it of form, to
mention the evening in Berner's-&s;treet.</P>
<P>&startq;I am a&s;hamed, Colonel,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, with
&s;ome he&s;itation, &startq;to own I have &s;een you
before, and feel mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly your deli|cacy
in not appearing to recollect a cir|cum&s;tance
&s;o little to my honour.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="227">
&startq;My indi&s;cretion did not merit this de|licacy;
and yet I feel that I could not
bear my folly &s;hould be known to any
per&s;on le&s;s candid than your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould even be &s;hocked if it was
known to Mrs. Herbert, though I love
her with the warme&s;t affection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As I mu&s;t appear to you at pre&s;ent in
a very unfavourable light, and as I have
the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of convincing you
I am not unworthy your e&s;teem, I will
beg you to hear me with patience whil&s;t
I explain to you every little particular in
re&s;pect to my acquaintance with Lord
Melvile, whom I blu&s;h to own I <HI>did</HI> love,
and whom perhaps I do not yet think of
with the indifference I ought.&endq;</P>
<P>She proceeded to relate her little hi&s;tory,
and to draw a faithful picture of her heart,
<PB N="231" REF="228">
with a &s;incerity in which Col. Herbert
found a thou&s;and charms.</P>
<P>She even owned that the &s;plendor of
Lady H's equipage had fir&s;t mi&s;led her, and
that ambition had had too large a &s;hare in
her partiality for Lord Melvile; though
&s;he in&s;i&s;ted, and with a vehemence which
Col. Herbert did not di&s;like, that &s;he really
<HI>had</HI> loved him.</P>
<P>He knew that a woman &s;eldom owns a
pa&s;&s;ion till it cea&s;es to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>He began to love her, and thought Lord
Melvile far from a dangerous rival, even
had not his &s;ituation in re&s;pect to Mi&s;s
Harding been what it was.</P>
<P>He, who was him&s;elf a man of fire, be|lieved
it impo&s;&s;ible a man of <HI>ton</HI> &s;hould in|&s;pire
a la&s;ting affection: &s;en&s;ibility alone is
the food of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="229">
He had been &s;truck <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI> with Mi&s;s
Villiers's per&s;on the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw
her, but thought no more of her till they
met at Mrs. Herbert's.</P>
<P>When he found her not only a woman
of honour, but the niece of his friend, her
charms appeared with redoubled lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>From that evening he determined to gain,
at lea&s;t, her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Her friend&s;hip! How are we mi&s;led by
words without meaning?</P>
<P>It was her love to which he a&s;pired, and
which he re&s;olved to gain.</P>
<P>Charming in London, at Greenwood he
found her divine.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="230">
Having with him no de&s;igns, no preten|&s;ions,
no views either dictated by ambition
or love, &s;he was with him perfectly at ea&s;e;
and only exerted that general de&s;ire of
plea&s;ing, which a young and beautiful
woman naturally feels with an amiable man
who &s;hews her particular attention.</P>
<P>The thorn of anxiety, which her vi&s;ionary
&s;chemes had planted in her bo&s;om, and
which had always given a con&s;traint to her
manner in her conver&s;ations with Lord
Melvile, was withdrawn, and had left her
all her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She was now natural, artle&s;s, gay, viva|cious,
unde&s;igning.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;he was the Maria of Belfont,
not of Berner's-&s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="231">
The ingenuity of the confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had
ju&s;t been making had touched Col. Herbert
in the mo&s;t lively manner.</P>
<P>It was not her beauty, her genius, her
various accompli&s;hments, which had riveted
his chains, but her noble &s;incerity, and the
feelings of her heart.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments for Lord Mel|vile,
of which he died to be him&s;elf the
object.</P>
<P>A momentary &s;ilence had taken place, and
both &s;eemed immer&s;ed in thought, when
they were arrou&s;ed by the &s;ound of car|riages.</P>
<P>As the road was directly under the low
wall on the top of which they were leaning,
Mi&s;s Villiers immediately knew Lord Mel|vile,
<PB N="235" REF="232">
who was in a &s;plendid chariot with&mdash;
Lady Melvile&mdash;for their hands had been
joined about an hour.</P>
<P>The train of attendant coaches, and the
white favours in the hats of the &s;ervants,
made it unnece&s;&s;ary for her to a&s;k any
que&s;tions.</P>
<P>A glow of mingled di&s;dain, expiring love,
and wounded vanity, &s;uffu&s;ed her cheek.</P>
<P>We need not &s;ay in what manner Col.
Herbert felt this event.</P>
<P>It is however nece&s;&s;ary to account for
the new-married pair's having pa&s;&s;ed Lady
Sophia's wall.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of Mr. Harding, though we did
not find this of con&s;equence enough to men|tion
&s;ooner, was only two miles di&s;tant from
the villa of Lady Sophia.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="233">
As the families did not vi&s;it, this had e&s;|caped
Mi&s;s Villiers's knowledge.</P>
<P>Lady Sophia kept little company, and was
extremely delicate in the choice of it: meer
money was by no means a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;|port
to the happine&s;s of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>She had a particular objection to admit|ting
Mr. Harding into her coterie, which
was that <HI>his</HI> father had been a menial &s;er|vant
to <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>But to our bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Our heroine was embarra&s;&s;ed, and Col.
Herbert a little at a lo&s;s how to re&s;ume the
conver&s;ation, when they were relieved by
the arrival of the ladies and Mr. Hammond,
who had accidentally met at the gate.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="234">
Mr. Hammond at Greenwood? Mr.
$word$ a friend of this family? What
a pie$&s;ing &s;urpri$e to the lovely Maria!</P>
<P>She $word$ however at the idea of his
being the $word$ of her author&s;hip.</P>
<P>She hoped he had too much honour to
betray her.</P>
<P>He approached her with all the gallantry
of &s;ixty-five, proclaimed his pa&s;&s;ion before
the whole company; and ob&s;erved, after
St. Evremond, that there was not the lea&s;t
impropriety in an old man's loving, though
there might be in his expecting to be be|loved,
to which happine&s;s he a&s;&s;ured her he
made not the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>After a turn round the garden, Lady
Sophia propo&s;ed adjourning to a party at
loo in the drawing-room.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="235">
Whil&s;t the cards were preparing, Mr.
Hammond regarded Maria with looks of
the &s;tronge&s;t compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot &s;uffer her to return to town.
I mu&s;t withdraw her from the precipice,
but without letting her &s;ee the hand
which &s;aves her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The utmo&s;t delicacy is requi&s;ite on this
occa&s;ion: a mind like hers will bear no
reproof but its own.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e were his reflections; and they pro|duced
a propo&s;al of making a tour of a
week, in which he was to be ma&s;ter of the
revels, with unlimited power to amu&s;e them
in whatever manner he thought proper.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villiers, who, not having money to
&s;ettle her affairs, was unable to quit London
intirely, who dreaded returning to it, who
<PB N="239" REF="236">
wi&s;hed to avoid even the po&s;&s;ibility of meet|ing
Lord Melvile, and who was too happy
in her pre&s;ent &s;ociety to think without re|luctance
of changing it, accepted the pro|po&s;al
with tran&s;port.</P>
<P>It was at lea&s;t throwing reflection at a
week's di&s;tance, which is an amazing point
gained.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Lady Sophia and Mrs. Herbert
were &s;ettling the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for
this little party, Mi&s;s Villiers and the Col.
&s;et down to picquet.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villiers had never ob&s;erved him &s;o
attentively before; the fire of his eyes, the
&s;pirit of his whole countenance, formed &s;uch
a contra&s;t with the mauki&s;h, unmeaning,
uninformed, macaroni faces about town, as
could not fail to &s;trike very forcibly a wo|man
of her turn of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="237">
He was certainly not &s;o hand&s;ome as
Lord Melvile&mdash;O! not a thou&s;andth part
&s;o hand&s;ome&mdash;</P>
<P>And yet &s;he knew not how&mdash;but he was
more intere&s;ting&mdash;had mor &s;oul&mdash;</P>
<P>There was an animation&mdash;&s;omething &s;o
&s;peaking in his every look&mdash;not an atom of
Lord Melvile's <HI>&s;ang froid.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, he was a very amiable man, and
though a woman would be unpardonable
who &s;hould <HI>love</HI> twice, yet there was cer|tainly
no impropriety in having a friend&s;hip
for a man of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o charming in his
attention to his mother&mdash;he was &s;o per|fectly
well-bred to women&mdash;&s;o much more
than well-bred, &s;o much in earne&s;t, &s;o <HI>em|pre&s;&s;&eacute;,</HI>
to oblige them&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="238">
But what was all this to her?&mdash;Lord Mel|vile
was fal&s;e, but his fal&s;ehood would be
a very inadequate apology for hers.</P>
<P>Yes, he was indeed fal&s;e, but he was &s;till
as dear to her as ever.</P>
<P>&startq;Adored object of my tenderne&s;s, whil&s;t
this heart beats, it &s;hall beat for thee.&endq;</P>
<P>Col. Herbert interrupted this &s;entimental
reverie by producing point, quint, and qua|torze,
which fini&s;hed the game almo&s;t as
&s;oon as it was begun.</P>
<P>The ladies and Mr. Hammond returned;
the play became general; loo took the place
of picquet: &s;upper was announced, Pam
retired; they chatted away an extremely
plea&s;ant evening, and &s;et out at nine the
next day; Lady Sophia and Mr. Hammond
in her lady&s;hip's po&s;t-chai&s;e; and Col. Her|bert,

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE plan of our travellers was to have
no plan at all, which we take to be
the mo&s;t rational and eligible that human
invention can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>They went every day exactly as far as
they cho&s;e, without giving attention either
to hours or mile-&s;tones; flew like the wind,
or pa&s;&s;ed lei&s;urely to ob&s;erve the face of
the country, ju&s;t as inclination pointed

<P>They mounted every hill that promi&s;ed
an agreeable pro&s;pect, whether it lay in or
out of the direct road; &s;topped at a twelve-penny
<PB N="243" REF="240">
hop, at a &s;trolling play, at a wake,

<P>Mi&s;s Villiers's heart &s;unk at the propo&s;al:
return to town! return to anxiety, to &s;oli|tude,
to di&s;tre&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="241">
She had been &s;o happy! They were be|come
&s;o much one family! She adored
Lady Sophia; perhaps &s;he might never &s;ee

<P>A &s;udden damp pervaded every bo&s;om:
they lamented that the hours of happine&s;s
&s;hould ever have an end; that friends &s;o
well &s;uited to each other &s;hould ever part.</P>
<P>A &s;igh of regret e&s;caped Maria; Col.
Herbert ob&s;erved it, and pre&s;&s;ed her hand
by an involuntary impul&s;e.</P>
<P>The dreaded order was given; the hor&s;es
heads were turned towards London, from
whence they were now di&s;tant eighty miles.</P>
<P>They travelled later this evening than
they had ever done before, in order to reach
an inn which Mr. Hammond &s;trongly re|commended,
<PB N="245" REF="242">
and which was kept by one of
his &s;ervants, for whom he had a great affec|tion.</P>
<P>In vain the ho&s;t of the inn they left ex|hau&s;ted
all the common-place rhetoric u&s;ual
on the&s;e occa&s;ions; a&s;&s;ured them the roads
were bad, being cro&s;s the country; that
there were highwaymen abroad; that it
threatened a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond was ob&s;tinate, the ladies
compliant, and the chai&s;es moved forward.</P>
<P>After they had gone about ten miles in
a very indifferent road, the night came on
almo&s;t imperceptibly.</P>
<P>To render its &s;hades more gloomy, a
thick cloud ob&s;cured the whole horizon.</P>
<P>They were now at the entrance of an ex|ten&s;ive
common: the po&s;tilions &s;topped,
<PB N="246" REF="243">
declared them&s;elves utterly unacquainted
with the road, and unable to proceed far|ther
without a guide, which it was now im|po&s;&s;ible
to procure.</P>
<P>It was happy for them that Col. Herbert
had been accu&s;tomed to <HI>reconnoitre:</HI> he
quitted the chai&s;e, mounted his &s;ervant's
hor&s;e, and directing the po&s;tilions to &s;top
till his return, undertook to be their <HI>avant

<P>The &s;torm now broke at once upon them;
the big tempe&s;t ro&s;e, the winds whi&s;tled
round and &s;hook the trees to their lowe&s;t

thunder rolled, the &s;treaming lightnings
ran along the ground, and produced a lu|minous
glare more terrific than darkne&s;s

<P>Col. Herbert had been gone from them
half an hour; an interval of which my
reader will imagine all the horrors.</P>

</LG>
<P>Their fears were more than doubled by
Col. Herbert's long ab&s;ence, and by their
anxiety on his account.</P>
<P>They called to him, but no &s;ound re|turned,
except that of their own voices,
reverberated by the echo.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to image the feelings of a mo|ther
on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; nor were tho&s;e of
Mrs. Herbert and Mi&s;s Villiers much le&s;s,
keen.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond &s;aid every thing he could
to encourage them, but to no purpo&s;e: their
apprehen&s;ions were rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t
pitch, all contributed to make them pant
<PB N="248" REF="245">
for an a&s;ylum, when Col. Herbert returned,
and informed them, that, dark as it was, he
had di&s;covered the track of wheels, and had
heard, though faintly, the barking of vil|lage
dogs.</P>
<P>With what tran&s;port they received this
intelligence none but tho&s;e who have been
in a &s;imilar &s;ituation can conceive.</P>
<P>They now hoped to regain the haunts of
men.</P>
<P>At all events Col. Herbert was &s;afe.</P>
<P>The &s;torm lo&s;t half its terrors from this
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>They advanced, though &s;lowly and with
caution, in the track Col. Herbert pointed
out, and in about an hour had the happi|ne&s;s
to hear a clock &s;trike; and to &s;ee,
through a coppice of trees, a glimmering
light at a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="246">
Directed by the light, they turned the
corner of the coppice, and pa&s;&s;ed a row of
cottages, at the end of which, a little de|tached
from the road, on a gently-ri&s;ing
ground, they &s;aw a hou&s;e from whence the
light which had directed them proceeded.</P>
<P>They rang at the bell, two &s;ervants came
with lights, a lady and gentleman followed
them to the gate, and on getting out of the
chai&s;e Mi&s;s Villiers found her&s;elf in the
arms of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>&startq;Maria!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Loui&s;a!&endq;</P>
<P>They could &s;ay no more: a&s;toni&s;hment
and joy rendered them breathle&s;s.</P>
<P>Col. Dormer, though not le&s;s happy to
&s;ee her, was le&s;s agitated, and enough ma&s;|ter
<PB N="250" REF="247">
of him&s;elf to do the honours of his
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was charmed to &s;ee Lady Sophia,

&s;ince &s;he had been a widow.</P>
<P>What &s;urprized Maria mo&s;t was, to find
Mr. Hammond &s;o well acquainted in the
family.</P>
<P>Our travellers entered the ho&s;pitable
walls of Belfont, and, in&s;tead of being in|truders
on &s;trangers, as they expected, had
the delight of finding them&s;elves at home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary to paint the joyous
evening at Belfont; but it may not be
ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Hammond was
in &s;uch &s;pirits after &s;upper, that he fairly
owned the meeting of this group of friends
to have been, not accidental, but a &s;urprize
of his contriving; and that he had commu|nicated
the &s;cheme, by letter, to Col. Dor|mer,
who therefore had expected and pre|pared
for them, but without betraying the
&s;ecret, even to Loui&s;a, who was as much
a&s;toni&s;hed at the meeting as her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t, however,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;that I
did not act in concert with the &s;torm,
though I found it a very u&s;eful auxiliary.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was under particular obligations to
the thunder, becau&s;e, being un&s;ea&s;onable,
<PB N="251" REF="249">
and therefore unexpected, it had ten
times the more effect.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t give the ladies credit for their
courage; they faced with heroi&s;m a war
of elements, which would have terrified a
<HI>macaroni</HI> into hy&s;terics.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Confe&s;s, ladies, did you ever &s;ee &s;o
charming an object as the light in this
parlour window?&endq;</P>
<P>The hours pa&s;&s;ed on &s;o rapidly, that it
was four in the morning before even the
female part of the company thought of re|tiring.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond, who was a <HI>bon vivant,</HI>
becau&s;e it had been the <HI>ton</HI> in his youth,
in&s;i&s;ted on one bottle of claret more to the
health of the ladies who had ju&s;t left them.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="250">
His &s;hare of this bottle elevated Col.
Herbert, who was before a little <HI>in alt,</HI> to
the pitch of declaring his pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s
Villiers to her uncle, and prote&s;ting, that,
though he was too poor at pre&s;ent to marry
her him&s;elf, he would run any other man
through the body who &s;hould dare to think
of her.</P>
<P>He was the be&s;t-humoured creature that
can be imagined, &s;ung <HI>beviamo tutti tre,</HI>
danced an allemande with Mr. Hammond,
drank the king's health, and the ladies, on
his knees, threw the gla&s;&s;es over his head,
and committed a thou&s;and indecorums, not
one of which had the lea&s;t analogy with the
pre&s;ent &s;tyle of elegant &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Not but that he was one of the &s;obere&s;t
men in the world, but&mdash;after a &s;torm&mdash;to
the health of one's prince, or one's mi&s;tre&s;s
&mdash;I forgive him with all my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="251">
It was with great difficulty Mr. Ham|mond
prevailed on him to retire to his
chamber, where, in&s;tead of going to bed,
he kept the good old man two hours to hear
him prote&s;t five hundred times over, and in
nearly the &s;ame words, that Cleopatra and
Helen of Greece were dowdies compared to
the divine Maria Villiers.</P>
<P>Morpheus at la&s;t took compa&s;&s;ion on Mr.
Hammond, and inclined our young &s;oldier
to let him retire to his apartment.</P>
<P>The leaden god kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
whole company till eleven the next day,
when on a&s;&s;embling in the breakfa&s;t par|lour,
they met Mr. Montague with his &s;on
and daughter, who, having heard of Maria's
arrival, with her friends, came to invite
them to a little ball the next day at the
manor-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="252">
The invitation was accepted, and the
Montagues con&s;ented to &s;pend the day at
Col. Dormer's.</P>
<P>Col. Herbert, after making a thou&s;and
apologies to Col. Dormer for having kept
him up the night before, took him into the
garden; and having, as in duty bound, paid
his devoirs to the reigning Sultana of his
green-hou&s;e, a hyacinth of di&s;tingui&s;hed
beauty, very <HI>&s;oberly</HI> a&s;ked his permi&s;&s;ion to
addre&s;s his lovely niece.</P>
<P>&startq;Your claret, my dear &s;ir, has done a
great deal for me, by precipitating my
confe&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I love Mi&s;s Villiers, and my rea&s;on and
my heart are equally touched. Be&s;ides
regarding her as the mo&s;t lovely of wo|men,
I find my&s;elf unhappy at the idea of
lo&s;ing her &s;ociety.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="253">
&startq;If I had a throne, I would offer it to
her; I have only a cottage, and I e&s;teem
her enough to believe, that, if I am &s;o
happy as to be agreeable to her, the dif|ference
between one and the other is not
e&s;&s;ential.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My paternal fortune is &s;mall; and I
divide it with my mother, who&s;e little in|come
before was really in&s;ufficient to &s;up|port
her with decency.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have only to offer, the glorious hopes
of a &s;oldier; a &s;oldier well-born, well-allied,
and fond of his profe&s;&s;ion, which
he has not di&s;graced.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If Mi&s;s Villiers will conde&s;cend to &s;hare
tho&s;e hopes, and, in the mean time, to
conform to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I &s;hall
be the happie&s;t man on earth.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="254">
&startq;My mother is at this moment plead|ing
my cau&s;e with Mi&s;s Villiers; may I
a&s;k you to add your per&s;ua&s;ions?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here &s;he comes her&s;elf, my dear
Charles, and I leave you to &s;ettle the
point with her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will &s;ay more for your&s;elf in five
minutes, than Lady Sophia and I &s;hould
&s;ay in ten years.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have only to ob&s;erve, that gain my
niece's con&s;ent, and you are &s;ure of mine
at any time.&endq;</P>
<P>There is no eloquence &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as the
language of an impa&s;&s;ioned heart: before
this conver&s;ation ended, Mi&s;s Villiers was
convinced of two truths very important to
female happine&s;s, that it is po&s;&s;ible to love
<PB N="258" REF="255">
twice, and to be happy without either a
coach and &s;ix or a title.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villiers left him not devoid of hope,
and ha&s;tened to dre&s;s with her &s;i&s;ter, her
own apartment being given up to Lady
Sophia.</P>
<P>During this interval the two &s;i&s;ters en|tered
into mutual confidence on all which
had happened to them during this ab&s;ence;
and Maria had the plea&s;ure to find the ami|able
Loui&s;a was in a few days to be united
to a man &s;he had always loved.</P>
<P>She then related her hi&s;tory, and dwelt
particularly on her fir&s;t interview with Col.
Herbert.</P>
<P>&startq;If I &s;hould marry him,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;it
would be the mo&s;t extraordinary com|mencement
of a matrimonial engagement
that ever happened.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="256">
&startq;I have been very indi&s;creet indeed,
Loui&s;a, but the inconveniences I have
found from that indi&s;cretion will make
me a pattern of circum&s;pection for the
future.&endq;</P>
<P>On relating the circum&s;tance of the hun|dred
pounds which had dropped from the
clouds, Loui&s;a's &s;u&s;picions fell very rightly
on Mr. Hammond.</P>
<P>The whole con&s;tellation of friends, the
Montagues included, were drinking their
coffee after dinner, when Col. Dormer's &s;er|vant,
whom he had &s;ent on bu&s;ine&s;s to Stam|ford,
returned, and brought $word$ his letters
from the po&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t he opened was from his tulip-merchant
at the Hague, with advice of his
having purcha&s;ed him a polyanthus, which
<PB N="260" REF="257">
he a&s;&s;ured him would grace the garden of
an emperor.</P>
<P>Joy lighted up his whole countenance on
reading the &s;econd; he gave it to Mr.
Hammond, who, by his de&s;ire, read aloud
as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;MY LORD, Naples, Jan. 15, 1775.</P>
<P>IT is my duty to inform your lord&s;hip,
that my old lord, your honoured kin&s;man,
the Earl of Clairville, died this morning,
and has left your lord&s;hip the family e&s;tate,
with &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds in the &s;tocks.</P>
<P>It is expre&s;&s;ed in the will that my lord
left the e&s;tate and money to your lord&s;hip,
both that it might not be divided from the
title, which is your lord&s;hip's by inheri|tance,
and to make you amends for his
having treated you har&s;hly in his life-time.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="258">
I hope to have the honour of being con|tinued
in your lord&s;hip's &s;ervice, and am,</P>
<CLOSER>My Lord,
With re&s;pect,
Your Lord&s;hip's dutiful Servant,
<SIGNED>WILLIAM JOHNSON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>P. S. I have directed the letter in your
lord&s;hip's old name, for fear of mi&s;takes at
the po&s;t-office.&endq;</P>
<P>The relation&s;hip was &s;o di&s;tant, and the
late Lord Clairville's treatment of the pre|&s;ent
&s;o unworthy, that grief could not be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have any &s;hare in the feelings
of the latter.</P>
<P>Congratulations are points taken for
granted, had not every per&s;on pre&s;ent been,
what however they were, per&s;onally inte|re&s;ted
in the change of Col. Dormer's &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="259">
&startq;I have always,&endq; &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing his
nieces, &startq;expected this event, but would not
communicate my hopes to you, le&s;t they
&s;hould end in di&s;appointment. I may
now be allowed to build ca&s;tles in the
air; it depends greatly on you, my dear
girls, to realize them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have more money than I know how
to make u&s;e of my&s;elf: I therefore pre|&s;ent
each of you with twenty thou&s;and
pounds, and leave it to your&s;elves to be|&s;tow
it as you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;h you (though in this I leave you
perfectly free) to fix in this neighbour|hood,
becau&s;e no acce&s;&s;ion of fortune
would make me amends for the lo&s;s of
your &s;ociety.&endq;</P>

&startq;Loui&s;a has already made a choice which

<P>&startq;Maria, are you determined on celi|bacy?&endq;</P>
<P>Her eyes were involuntarily turned on
Col. Herbert; &s;he perceived it, looked
down, and blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand you, and am happy: I will
&s;pare your confu&s;ion, my dear Maria, and
give you to my cadet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And now for my airy project; it is to
form a neighbourhood of per&s;ons en|deared
to each other by the mo&s;t tender
ties.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="261">
&startq;My duty to my prince and my country

<P>&startq;For our be&s;t, our rural, hou&s;e, as Lord
