THE MAID OF BATH, A COMEDY, OF THREE ACTS, As it is performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL, in the Hay-Market.</P>

<HEAD>TO SAMUEL FOOTE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very ungentleman-like treatment you have experienced from the avariciou&s;ne&s;s and per&s;onal envy of the managers of both hou|&s;es, in mutilating your plays and changing them into farces, determined you, long &s;ince, to &s;up|pre&s;s the publication of any future production. With an eye of pity you beheld the &s;ordid views and ungenerous di&s;po&s;itions of Mr. C. and Mr. G. A &s;pecies of dramatic writing they never could attain to, prompted them to injure you in in the nice&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, that of profitting by the labour and invention of a Gen|tleman, who&s;e abilities, as actor and performer, could &s;upport the expences of a theatre at a time, when with all their ingenuity and pageantry, they
<PB N="4" REF="3">
are under ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hutting up their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e motives, the Public had to regret the lo&s;s of tho&s;e pieces which do the greate&s;t honor to your literary merit.</P>
<P>ONE objection, only, was rai&s;ed to this pub|lication of the MAID OF BATH, <HI>viz.</HI> That whil&s;t the Publi&s;her rail'd at the avariciou&s;ne&s;s of others, he might be condemn'd for covetou&s;ne&s;s and un|generous treatment him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT the ca&s;e is materially different. As you never intended to benefit your&s;elf by a publica|tion, no injury can be done you by its being publi&s;hed by another hand. In &s;hort, Sir, could the lea&s;t injury accrue, no one would be more ready to forego every advantage; but whil&s;t the contrary is manife&s;tly the ca&s;e, you and the world will excu&s;e me for giving them the peru&s;al of a piece which they have long lamented as buried in oblivion; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who never could have an opportunity of &s;eeing the performance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Kitty, it is in vain to deny it. I am convinced there is &s;ome little, low, paltry pa&s;&s;ion, lurking in that brea&s;t of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear mother, you wrong me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear Mi&s;s, but I don't! What el&s;e could induce you to reject the addre&s;&s;es of a lover like this? Ten thou&s;and pounds a year! Gads my li&s;e, there is not a lady in town would refu&s;e him, let her rank be ever &s;o&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not his fortune, that I firmly believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! and who, now-a-days, marries for any thing el&s;e? Would you refu&s;e an e&s;tate becau&s;e it happens to be a little encumber'd? You mu&s;t con&s;ider the man, in this ca&s;e, as a kind of a mortgage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the di&s;proportion of years.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my dear Mother, our minds; how very widely they differ! my nature is liberal and frank, tho' I am but a little remov'd from mediocrity; but his heart, in the very bo&s;om of wealth, is &s;hut to every &s;ocial &s;en&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Mi&s;s, this heart you have had the happine&s;s to unlock. I hope you don't urge his offers to you as a proof of his pa&s;&s;ion for money! Why, you forget your&s;elf, Kate; who, in the name of wonder do yo think that you are? What, becau&s;e you have a baby face, and can bawl a few ballads&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, madam, you know I was never vain of my talents; if they can procure me a de|cent &s;upport, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repay my father and you for their kind cultivation&mdash;</P>

<P>And&punc; how long are you &s;ure your talents, as you call them, will &s;erve you?&mdash;Are a &s;et of features &s;ecure again&s;t time; and won't a &s;ingle &s;ore throat de&s;troy the boa&s;ted power of your pipe!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. L.</SPEAKER>
<P>What mu&s;t become of you then? Now by this means you are &s;afe, above the reach of ill fortune; be&s;ides, child, to put your own in|tere&s;t out of the que&s;tion, have you no tender feelings for us? Con&s;ider, my love, you don't want for good nature; and your con&s;ent to this

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s L.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deceive your&s;elf, indeed, my dear mother: He a friend! I dare believe, the fir&s;t proof you will find of his friend&s;hip, will be, his po&s;itive commands to break off all corre&s;pondence with every relation I have.</P>
</SP>
