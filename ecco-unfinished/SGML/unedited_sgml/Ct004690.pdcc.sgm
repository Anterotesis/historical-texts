<P>HE who hopes to increa&s;e his reputa|tion, (if he have any already) as a Writer, by &s;ketching a mere vehicle for Sing-&s;ong, and Shew,&mdash;is a Block|head. He who indites an elaborate Critici&s;m, on &s;uch a vehicle,&mdash;is a Block|head;&mdash;or, he is wor&s;e:&mdash;a malignant fellow, pretending to mi&s;take a Dra|mati&s;t's Jerkin, for his be&s;t 'Coat, that he may pick a hole in it.</P>
<P>Be it known to you, <HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs!</HI> that this &s;ame &s;cribbling <HI>in a jerkin,</HI>&mdash;but, by the way, it mu&s;t not be ragged,&mdash;is be&s;t &s;uited to &s;ome occa&s;ions; and not at all di&s;re&s;pectful to the Company.&mdash;To have aim'd at writing in <HI>full dre&s;s,</HI> in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance, would have been a wa&s;te of wardrobe;&mdash;and, as idle, and ex|travagant, as riding on hor&s;e-back, in Hyde Park, in a bag-wig and &s;word.</P>

<P>My Coadjutors, in this <HI>Spectacle,</HI> are the &s;ame as in <HI>Blue-Beard;</HI> and I have now, as full a tribute of prai&s;e, and thanks, to render to the Compo&s;er of the Mu&s;ick, to the Machini&s;t, and to the Scene-Painter, as I had to offer when they exerted their talents for me, la&s;t year.</P>
<P>To all the Performers, in the Piece, I make my be&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">In the Scene of the Banquet-Gallery, I owe &s;omething to a foreign Dramati&s;t. If any one &s;hould have curio&s;ity, or lei&s;ure enough, to inquire how much, or how little, I am obliged to him, let him peru&s;e <HI>Tarare,</HI> written by <HI>Mon&s;. Beaumarchais.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE THE LAST.</HI> On the right of the Stage, is the exterior of Ruthen|wolf Ca&s;tle. The Chief Entrance is repre&s;ented in a &s;ide view; con&s;isting of a Gateway, between two Turrets;&mdash;the Bridge drawn up. The Ca&s;t|le is partially moated;&mdash;the water lo&s;ing it&s;elf un|der a low arch, beneath the battlements, before it has completely encircled the building:&mdash;But the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
Battlements are continued beyond the place where the moat is lo&s;t; and at the ba&s;e of the&s;e is a Sally Port, clo&s;e to the ground. Above them, a black round Tower.<LB>From a window in the round Tower, and, al&s;o, from a window in one $word$ the turrets, are flights of &s;teps, which communicate with the ramparts.<LB>On the left of the Stage, are high tufted Trees: At the back, Mountains, in per&s;pective, and the Sun ri&s;ing above them.<LB>Fitzallan, Henry, and Orlando are drawn up on the left, with Soldiery and Cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. Pio|neers at work upon a Mine, at the mouth of the Sally Port; beneath the Round Tower. The moment the Scene is di&s;clo&s;ed, a loud Shout, and a heavy can|nonade, from Fitzallan's party;&mdash;with a &s;hower of Arrows&mdash;which is return'd by Ruthenwolf's Soldiery, who are thickly placed on the Turrets.</HEAD>
