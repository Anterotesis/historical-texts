<HEAD>AN <HI>ADDRESS,</HI> To the DIGNITARIES OF THE <HI>CHURCH OF ENGLAND;</HI> By the Rev. JAMES MURRY, <HI>OF NEWCASTLE,</HI> AUTHOR OF SERMONS TO ASSES, <HI>And of Two Sermons for the General Fa&s;t</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU always provide the inferior Clergy, your menial church &s;ervants, with a form of prayer, to be u&s;ed on the day of national fa&s;ting, but you totally neglect to furni&s;h them with &s;er|mons, &s;uitable for &s;uch an occa&s;ion.&mdash;Your remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in this particular, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tant with the tenour of your con|duct: you concur in the appointment of general fa&s;ts; but while you wallow in exce&s;s and roit, alas? you leave your Curates (poor &s;ouls,)to experience the practical part of fa&s;ting. In this you follow the example of your antient friends, the Phara&s;ees, "You bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens &s;houlders, but you will not move them with one of your fingers." How often my lords, have you &s;quandered more money at one entertainment, than two or three curates have for the &s;upport of them&s;elves, and their families for a whole year? The reflection would make any per&s;on blu&s;h, except a modern Bi&s;hop&mdash;Your con&s;ciences are &s;tupified through voluptou&s;ne&s;s; but the day is nigh at hand, when your titles will not avail, nor your lawn &s;leeves and mitres protect you, from the righteous judgment that will be pa&s;&s;ed on every one. When men will not receive a partial &s;entence, or be judged according to exter|nal appearance, but where all di&s;tinctions of character will be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A FEW EXTRACTS, <HI>Taken from the</HI> Rev MR. MURRRY'S <HI>fir&s;t &s;ermon, for the general fa&s;ts,</HI> in 1781, text, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, x. 16. <HI>Woe to thee Oh land! when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This land in which we live; one would think would have no rea&s;on to be afraid of the fir&s;t part of this heavy woe, in the text,&mdash;for the &s;overeign of the Briti&s;h Empire, has him&s;elf a nu|merous and <HI>beatiful</HI> family of children, which in one &s;en&s;e clears him of the imputation of being a child. With re&s;pect to the latter part of this woe, there may be &s;ome rea&s;on to he&s;itate,
<PB N="2" REF="2">The word in the text, which &s;ignifies princes, is not confined in its &s;ignification to princes of the blood royal, but may al&s;o be app$$ed to chief men, or the companion-of princes&mdash;or it may be u&s;ed to &s;ignify privy councellors, or mini&s;ters of &s;tate. When per&s;ons of this character mind eating in the morning, more than the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the commonwealth, it is truly a woeful thing to any nation.</P>
<P>It appears &s;ufficiently evident, that Solomon means in this place, by eating and drinking in the morning, tho&s;e nocturnal re$els, where people at up till three or four in the morning, and go to re&s;t when they &s;hould go to bu&s;ine&s;s, and are not fit for employment till the middle of the day.</P>
<P>The danger that $word$ to a nation, when princes eat in the morning is very gre$$ for when their judgments are blinde I and their imaginations $word$, they are ready to pur&s;ue tho&s;e ob|jects of de&s;ire, which fancy &s;ugge&s;ts, in&s;tead of tho&s;e which rea&s;on and judgment would dictate to &s;ober per&s;ons, and &s;o they either forget national concerns to pur&s;ue their own fancy, or manage all public concerns according to imagination and contrary to rea&s;on and found judgment. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their lord&s;hips, who have gone to bed gordged with high &s;ea&s;oned food, and &s;trong drink at four o'clock in the morning, can be well qualified to judge of an expre&s;s from Berlin, Madrid, or the We&s;t-Indias. For though they may be wi&s;er than other men (which is even problematical) yet they are not naturally &s;tronger, and mu&s;t have re&s;t and &s;leep as well as others. And it is plain that their wi&s;dom can be of little &s;ervice to the nation when they are a&s;leep. It is true, they have &s;ecretaries that are intended to wait upon bu&s;ine&s;s in their ab&s;ence:&mdash;but wicked fame &s;ays, that they al&s;o eat in the morning and &s;leep as long as their matters.</P>
<P>There is another woeful thing happens, when princes and privy councellors eat in the morning, and that is, it gives the world rea&s;on to infer, that the &s;overeign, though he may be a man in point of age, is but a child in conduct, when he employs &s;uch irregular and &s;lothful &s;ervants, to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s of the em|pire; for it &s;eldom happens that the fir&s;t and latter part of this woe is &s;eperated.</P>
<P>If Great Britain is at this day an exception, it will be a hap|py circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>When the king is a child, and princes eat in the morning, it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee tho&s;e muddy legi&s;lators exagerate modern &s;tatues, and enforce them by the &s;evere&s;t &s;anctions, which are diametrically oppo&s;ite and contrary to ancient laws, and fundamental in&s;titutions. Rulers cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed well qualified to make laws for others, when they are under the imme|diate influence of intemperance, and their &s;en&s;es and under&s;t|ings annhilated, and in a real del$um: princes and mini&s;ters of &s;tate, can but ill advi&s;e for the good of a nation, when they are led tottering from the $word$, to their palaces, and tumble into
<PB N="3" REF="3">their couches in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; &s;upported by &s;uch totter|ing pillars, it is no wonder the &s;tate &s;taggers, and the throne &s;hakes.</P>
<P>$hen rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with di&s;&s;ipation, they are ready to ima|gine, that the whole community is as fooli&s;h as them&s;elves, and for that rea&s;on endeavour to per&s;uade the people, that it is faction to oppo&s;e their mea&s;ures, and trea&s;on to maintain their own rights. Becau&s;e people will not mini&s;ter to the gratification of the lu&s;t and appetites of tho&s;e who want to en&s;lave them, they are called factious and rebellious.</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;arah will help us to under&s;tand what is proper|ly rebellion: he &s;ays, <Q>thy princes are rebellions, and the com|panions &startq;of thieves, every one $oveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fartherle&s;s, neither doth the cau&s;e &endq;of the widow come before them.</Q> From this $word$ is plate, that princes may be rebellious, and that when they are the com|panions of thieves, they come under that predicament, joining intere&s;t and partner&s;hip with thieves and di&s;hone&s;t per&s;ons. The&s;e are &s;uch as take what is not their own, and apply it to their own purpo&s;es, this is a $$$ur&s;e compliment to princes, but as it is given by an $word$ prophet, it cannot be taken ami&s;s. It is al&s;o di&s;hone&s;t to promote, or procure laws that make it le|gal, to give them more than the people can afford; this comes under the notion of theft, and rebellion, according to the pro|phet's idea.</P>
<P>The princes of Judea&punc; and I&s;r$$I&punc; went partner&s;hip with the &s;overeign in the plunder of the nation, they voted large &s;upplies to the king, becau&s;e they knew they &s;hould receive a &s;hare in the revenue and might promote a law for encrea&s;ing the civil lift, in hope of &s;erving in his majesty's hou&s;hold; but this was theft and $span$ ju&s;tice and the laws of the land.</P>
<P>Seeking $word$ gifts, and following after rewards, are joined rebellion, this probably refered to a vote of credit, which the ad|mini&s;tration of Judea, procured to an&s;wer the $word$ of &s;ecret &s;ervice, without any de&s;ign of going any thing with it for the good of the nation, this is joined with theft and rebellion.</P>
<P>And indeed, what can be a greater theft than to procure the credit of a nation, to $word$ money for the &s;ervice thereof, and apply it to private purpo&s;es? Were &s;uch a thing done in Britain, the whole nation would have rea&s;on to cry out again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Thus it is plain, that rebellion is not a crime, peculiar to the people only, but is &s;ometimes to be found in the &s;prings of go|vernment. Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion, but the &s;cripture informs us other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>As we are certain from the be&s;t authority, that even princes may rebel. The que&s;tion is&mdash;Ought they to be puni&s;hed like other rebels, and who can lawfully puni&s;h them: whether there is any difference between trying kings and princes for rebel|lion, and puni&s;h them without trying them? I &s;hall leave to the $word$ and $word$, to determine,</P>

<L>Now liberty's gone</L>
<L>Oppre&s;&s;ion will come,</L>
