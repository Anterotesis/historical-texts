<P>THE HYPOCRITE: A COMEDY.</P>

PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAD any objections been made to this play, worth taking notice of, I &s;hould be un|der no obligations to an&s;wer them, being ac|countable for none of it's faults, as I lay claim to none of it's beauties. Cibber's Non-Juror (bor|rowed from the Tartuffe of Moliere) has ever been reckoned an excellent comedy; but be|ing written to expo&s;e a party, it was no longer intere&s;ting, becau&s;e the folly and roguery it de|&s;ign'd to ridicule, no longer exi&s;ted: It was thought, that it might be render'd agreeable to the pre&s;ent times, by once more having recour&s;e to Moliere; and, with that view, I have endea|vour'd to &s;ub&s;titute his celebrated character of Tartuffe, in the room of Doctor Wolf.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick determin'd to do this about two years ago; but, becau&s;e the con&s;equence of &s;uc|ce&s;s wou'd be a benefit ea&s;ily gotten, he kindly put it into my hands, with &s;ome hints for the
<PB REF="4">
alteration. He did not think it was nece&s;&s;ary to have any thing new, be&s;ides a &s;hort character for that entertaining comedian, Mr. We&s;ton: Maw-worm therefore in this play is written by me, and &s;carce any thing more. For the re&s;t, the character of Doctor Cantwell, as it here &s;tands, is almo&s;t a verbal tran&s;lation from Moliere, as old Lady Lambert is a counterpart of Madam Pernelle.</P>
<P>All the world knows, that the Tartuffe is reckon'd among the <HI>Chef des Oeuvres</HI> of the French Theatre; I may therefore pre&s;ume with|out any vanity, in &s;pite of the ignorance and malevolence of little judges, that the man who takes two &s;uch plays as I have had to work upon, cou'd not, under the direction of Mr. Garrick, produce a very bad one; e&s;peci|ally if he pre&s;um'd to foi&s;t in little or nothing of his own: And the remarkably kind reception the public have given to this Comedy, makes me believe they are well content with my humble endeavour to entertain them.</P>
<P>Gratitude, however, obliges me to take notice of the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have receiv'd from Mrs. Abington and Mr. King. The former, in the character of Charlotte, (Cibber's admirable Maria) is &s;o excellent, that I cannot conceive it po&s;&s;ible for any actre&s;s ever to have gone beyond
<PB REF="5">
her. There is a natural ea&s;e and vivacity in her manner, and, in this part particularly, a fa&s;hionable deportment (if I may u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion) which gives a brilliancy to every thing &s;he &s;ays, and has in a very uncommon manner, engaged the attention and applau&s;e of the town. The latter, in the part of the Hypocrite, has &s;hewn that he is capable of a&s;&s;uming cha|racters the mo&s;t difficult, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite; and, by each new effort, to add to the e&s;teem which the public appears to have for him.</P>

<P>So I do, Sir, that I am her Father, and will di&s;po&s;e of her as I plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not di&s;pute your authority, Sir; but as I am your &s;on too, I think it my duty to be concern'd for your honour. Have not you countenanc'd his addre&s;|&s;es to my &s;i&s;ter? has not &s;he received them?&mdash;Mr. Darnley's birth and fortune are well known to you, and, I dare &s;wear, he may defy the world to lay a blemi&s;h on his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, &s;ince I am to be catechiz'd, I mu&s;t tell you, I do not like his character: he is a world|&s;erver, a libertine, and has no more religion than you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we neither of us think it proper to make a boa&s;t of our religion; but, if you will plea&s;e to en|quire, you will find that we go to church as orderly as the re&s;t of our neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you go to church! you go to church!&mdash;Wonderful! wonderful! to bow, and grin, and cough, and &s;leep: a fine act of devotion indeed.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but dear Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, you are an athei&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir! I am none: it is a character I abhor; and, next to that, I abhor the character of an enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you do &s;o; an enthu&s;ia&s;t!&mdash;this is the fa&s;hion|able phra&s;e, the bye-word, the nick-name, that our plea&s;ure-loving generation give to tho&s;e few who have a &s;en&s;e of true &s;anctity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, canting Sir&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what, Son, as I have told you more than once, you will draw &s;ome heavy judgment on your head one day or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;ays the charitable Doctor Cantwell: you have taken him into your hou&s;e, and, in return, he gives over half your family to the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not abu&s;e the Doctor, Colonel; it is not the way to my favour. I know you cannot bear him, be|cau&s;e he is not one of your mincing preachers.&mdash;He holds up the candle to your enormities, &s;hews you to your&s;elves in your genuine colours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always re&s;pect piety and virtue, Sir; but there are pretenders to religion, as well as to courage: and as we never find the truly brave to be &s;uch as make much noi&s;e about their valour; &s;o, I apprehend, the truly good &s;eldom or ever deal much in grimace.&mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="9">
To be candid, Sir, I make a di&s;tinction between hy|pocri&s;y and devotion, and can never pay the &s;ame regard to the ma&s;k, that I would to the face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; this is very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, I &s;hould be glad to know, by what authority the Doctor pretends to exerci&s;e the clerical function.&mdash;It does not appear clearly to me, that he ever was in orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no bu&s;ine&s;s of yours, Sir.&mdash;But I am better informed.&mdash;However, he has the call of zeal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I cannot &s;ee with temper, Sir, &s;o many re|ligious mountebanks impo&s;e on the unwary multi|tude; wretches, who make a trade of religion, and &s;hew an uncommon concern for the next world, only to rai&s;e their fortunes with greater &s;ecurity in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, let me hear no more: I &s;ee you are too hardned to be converted now; but &s;ince you think it your duty, as a &s;on, to be concerned for my errors; I think it as much mine, as a father, to be concerned for yours.&mdash;If you think fit to mend them &s;o; if not, take the con&s;equence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, may I a&s;k you without offence, if the rea&s;ons you have given me are your only rea&s;ons, for di&s;countenancing Mr. Darnley's addre&s;&s;es to my &s;i&s;ter?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, the dear good Lady, I will ki&s;s her hand; but what advice can &s;he give me? The riches of the word, Sir, have no charms for me; I am not dazzled with their fal&s;e glare; and was I, I repeat it, to accept of the tru&s;t you want to repo&s;e in me, heaven knows, it would only be le&s;t the means &s;hould fall into wicked hands, who wou'd not lay it out as I &s;hould do, for the glory of heaven, and the good of my neighbour.</P>

<P>Nothing, Madam; nothing.&mdash;But you were witne&s;s how the worthy Colonel treated me this morning&mdash;not that I &s;peak it on my own account,&mdash;for to be revil'd is my portion.</P>

<P>O Sir, 'tis plain; 'tis plain; your whole family are in a combination again&s;t m$&mdash;your &s;on and daughter hate me; they think I &s;tand between them and your favour; and indeed it is not fit I &s;hould do &s;o; for, fall'n as they are, they are &s;till your children,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, con&s;ider, Doctor&mdash;&s;hall my wicked &s;on then be heir to my lands, before repentance has intitled him to favour&mdash;No, let him depend upon you, whom he has wrong'd; perhaps, in time, he may reflect on his father's ju&s;tice, and be reconcil'd to your reward|ed virtues.&mdash;If heav'n &s;hould at la&s;t reclaim him, in you, I know, he &s;till would find a fond forgiving father.</P>

<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, young lady, be a&s;&s;ured, &s;o far am I from the unchri&s;tian di&s;po&s;ition of returning injuries, that your antipathy to me cau&s;es no hatred in my &s;oul towards you; on the contrary, I would willingly make

<P>Mr. Darnley, I am glad I have met with you here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have endeavour'd twice to-day, Sir, to pay my re|&s;pects to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll be plain with you&mdash;I went out to avoid you; but where the welfare of a child is concern'd, you mu&s;t not take it ill if we don't &s;tand upon cere|mony&mdash;However, &s;ince I have rea&s;on now to be more in temper than perhaps I was at that time, I &s;hould be glad to talk with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take it as a favour, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t allow, Mr. Darnley, that con&s;cience is the rule which every hone&s;t man ought to walk by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis granted, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me leave to tell you, Sir, that giving you my daughter, would be to act again&s;t that con&s;cience I pretend to, while I thought you an ill-liver; and con|&s;equently the &s;ame tie obliges me to be&s;tow her on a better man&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, Sir; to come to the point. Suppo&s;e the Doctor (whom I pre&s;ume you de&s;ign her for) actually con&s;ents to give me up his intere&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why do you &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, he will give up his in|tere&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only judge from what your daughter tells me, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="78" REF="84">
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appeal to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I appeal even to your&s;elf, Sir&mdash;Has not the Doctor, ju&s;t now, in the garden, &s;poke in favour of Mr. Darnley to you? Nay, pray, Sir, be plain; becau&s;e more depends on that, than you can ea&s;ily imagine or believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;en&s;ele&s;s in&s;inuation have you got into your head now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be &s;o kind, Sir, fir&s;t to an&s;wer me, that I may be better able to inform you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own he has declin'd his intere&s;t in favour of Mr. Darnley; but I mu&s;t tell you, Madam, he did it in &s;o mode&s;t, &s;o friendly, &s;o good-natur'd, &s;o con&s;cien|tious a manner, that I now think my&s;elf more than ever bound in honour to e&s;pou&s;e him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Sir, (only for argument's &s;ake) Suppo&s;e I could prove that all this &s;eeming virtue was artificial; that his regard for Mr. Darnley was neither founded upon mode&s;ty, friend&s;hip, good-nature, nor con|&s;cience: or, in &s;hort, that he has, like a villain, bar|ter'd, bargain'd, to give me to Mr. Darnley, for half the four thou&s;and pounds you valued his con&s;ent at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impious to &s;uppo&s;e it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, from what principle mu&s;t you &s;uppo&s;e that I accu&s;e him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>From an ob&s;tinate prejudice to all that's good and virtuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="79" REF="85">
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's too hard, Sir. But, the wor&s;t your opi|nion can provoke me to, is to marry Mr. Darnley, without either his con&s;ent or yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you brave me, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but I &s;corn a lie; and will &s;o far vindicate my integrity, as to in&s;i&s;t on your believing me; if not, as a child you abandon, I have a right to throw my|&s;elf into other arms for protection.</P>

<P>Dear Charlotte, how your &s;pirit charms me!</P>

<P>I am confounded. The&s;e tears cannot be counter|feit; nor can this be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I fear it is. Give me leave to a&s;k you one que&s;tion. In all our mutual cour&s;e of hap|pine&s;s, have I ever yet deceived you with a fal&s;hood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you then believe me, &s;hould I accu&s;e him even of crimes which virtue blu&s;hes but to mention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what extravagance would you drive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would before have undeceiv'd you, when his late artifice turned the hone&s;t duty of your &s;on into his own reproach and ruin; but knowing then your temper was inacce&s;&s;ible, I dur&s;t not offer it.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould be able to let you &s;ee his villainy, make him re|peat his odious love to me in your own hearing, at once throw off the ma&s;k, and &s;hew the barefac'd tray|tor.</P>

<P>Madam, your woman tells me, that being here, and alone, you de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir&mdash;but, that we may be &s;ure we are alone, pray &s;hut the outward door, and &s;ee that pa&s;&s;age be clear too&mdash;another &s;urprize might ruin us&mdash;is all &s;afe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken care, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am afraid I interrupt your meditations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, no; I was only looking over &s;ome pious exhortations here, for the u&s;e of a &s;ociety of cho&s;en brethren.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Doctor! what have you done to me? the trouble of my mind, &s;ince our la&s;t unfortunate conference, is not to be expre&s;s'd. You, indeed, di&s;covered to me, what perhaps, for my own peace, 'twere better I had never been acquainted with; but I had not &s;ufficient time to lay my heart open to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="88">
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whither, Madam, would you lead me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been unea&s;y too, not knowing how far you might mi&s;take my behaviour on the la&s;t accident that happen'd; but I was really &s;o &s;hock'd, &s;o terrified, I knew not what I was doing: only had I join'd in your defence again&s;t the Colonel, it would have been evi|dent I was his enemy, and I have u&s;es for his friend|&s;hip. Silence, therefore, was my only prudent part; and I knew your credit with Sir John needed no &s;up|port.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me pre&s;ume then to hope, that what I did, you judge was &s;elf-defence, and pure nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, after all, the accident was lucky; for Sir John, in order to obviate any ill con&s;tructions that may be put upon it, in&s;i&s;ts now that we &s;hould be more together, to let the world &s;ee his confidence in us both. This relieves us from re&s;traint, and I now dare tell you&mdash;but no&mdash;I won't&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why, Madam? let me be&s;eech you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! do not endeavour to decoy my fooli&s;h heart, too apt to flatter it&s;elf. You cannot, &s;ure, think kindly of me?</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, may I not with rea&s;on &s;u&s;pect, that this ap|parent goodne&s;s is but artifice, a &s;hadow of compliance, meant only to per&s;uade me from your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks this doubt of me &s;eems rather founded on your &s;ettled re&s;olution not to re&s;ign her. 'Tis &s;he, I find, is your &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, gentlemen, the affair is circum&s;tantially this&mdash;The Doctor called me out into the pavilion in the garden; appear'd in great di&s;order; told me there was a &s;udden &s;torm rai&s;ed, which he was not &s;ufficient|ly prepared to weather. He &s;aid, his dependance was upon me&punc; and, at all events, I mu&s;t $e ready to &s;wear, when he called upon me, I had &s;een him pay Sir John &s;everal large &s;ums of money. He talked confu&s;edly a|bout giving value for an e&s;tate, but I boldly refu&s;ed to perjure my&s;elf; and told him, on the contrary, I was &s;atisfied he had fleeced Sir John of &s;everal large &s;ums, under pretence of charitable u&s;es, which he &s;ecretly converted to his own.&mdash;This &s;tung him&mdash;and he fa&s;t|ened at my throat. Then, indeed, all temper left me; and, di&s;engaging my&s;elf from his hold, with a home|blow, &s;truck him down. At this, grown de&s;perate, he ran with fury to &s;ome pi&s;tols that hung above the chim|ney; but in the in&s;tant he reach'd one, I &s;eiz'd upon his wri&s;t; and as we grappled, the pi&s;tol firing to the cieling, alarm'd the family.</P>
