<HEAD>SECRET
MEMOIRS
OF A
Trea&s;onable Conference.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has often been &s;aid
in Publick, and once in
Print, by a noble Per|&s;on,
who became an
Author upon that very
Occa&s;ion: That there
were a Set of TORIES in this King|dom,
who were always &s;incere in the
Revolution-Principle, and loyal Sub|jects
to the Sovereign; Friends to
the E&s;tabli&s;hment in Church and
State, and who ought &s;till to be
<PB N="2" REF="3">
treated as true Lovers of their Coun|try:
The Rea&s;on given for this was,
becau&s;e they had &s;hewn them&s;elves
&s;o upon all Occa&s;ions; and e&s;pecially
in the late Reign, when the Whigs
and they joyn'd in again&s;t the la&s;t
Mini&s;try of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and again&s;t
the Mea&s;ures of that Time: It was
remembred of the&s;e Men, that they
came into the Intere&s;t of the Pro|te&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch &s;ea|&s;enable
Zeal and Affection, that the
King thought fit to entru&s;t &s;everal
of them with a Part in the Regency;
committing a Share of the fir&s;t Ad|mini&s;tration
to their Hands, as Per|&s;ons
who had given &s;uch Te&s;timony
of their Fidelity, as was not only &s;a|tisfactory
to his Maje&s;ty, but as had
even reconciled &s;ome of the be&s;t of
his Subjects to them; and upon this
Principle, many of them were very
kindly accepted, and <HI>all the re&s;t who
came in to their Mea&s;ures,</HI> were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the Name of <HI>REVOL&V;|TION
TORIES.</HI></P>
<P>It has &s;ince been ob&s;erv'd in their
Favour, that none of the&s;e Revoluti|on
Tories, e&s;pecially of the more con|&s;iderable
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of them, ever came into the
late Rebellion, or can be &s;aid to
have concerted any Mea&s;ures with
the Rebels; But, on the contrary, ad|hering
&s;trictly to the pa&s;&s;ive Do|ctrine,
which at fir&s;t went a great
way in denominating them as <HI>Tories,</HI>
they never &s;uffered <HI>Nature to act a|gain&s;t
Principle;</HI> No not even then,
when they thought them&s;elves not
treated according to their Merit.</P>
<P>But as it has all along been the
Opinion of &s;ome wi&s;e Men, that
<HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> however moderate,
are by the Nature of their politick
Notions, incompatible in the Admi|ni&s;tration
of this Government; &s;o it
could not be far, that Men of &s;uch
differing Foundations could go toge|ther;
NO: notwith&s;tanding their
Agreement in the main and funda|mental
Points of the Con&s;titution:
and tho' the Wi&s;dom of the Govern|ment
found it po&s;&s;ible, and perhaps
endeavour'd to have made it more
&s;o, to go on with the&s;e Men with a
great deal of Harmony and Unani|mity,
in the more general and e&s;&s;en|tial
Parts of the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and that they, on their part, &s;eem'd
to come heartily into tho&s;e common
Points, which are nece&s;&s;ary to all Go|vernment;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>re&s;i&s;ting the Rebels,</HI>
&s;ettling <HI>the Revenue,</HI> rai&s;ing <HI>Troops,
Taxes,</HI> &amp;c. yet when it came to the
Pu&s;h, in the nicer Parts of the Admi|ni&s;tration,
<HI>&s;uch as</HI> pro&s;ecuting nece&s;|&s;ary
Ju&s;tice upon Criminals, &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing
Riots and Tumults, entru&s;ting
needful Powers in the Hands of the
Sovereign upon extraordinary Occa|&s;ions;
putting in, and putting out
Per&s;ons, and &s;everal other like Ca&s;es;
the&s;e Gentlemen have been con&s;tant|ly
found to be a dead Weight again&s;t
the common Intere&s;t; and if the Ja|cobites
have not been vi&s;ibly joyn'd,
they have not fail'd to encourage
them&s;elves with the Expectation that
&s;ome time or other they might, by
the help of the&s;e <HI>Tories,</HI> embarra&s;s the
Government with it &s;elf, and open
a Gap, by the Di&s;&s;ention of Parties,
to break in upon the Con&s;titution,
and upon the Succe&s;&s;ion al&s;o.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Di&s;coveries, the Go|vernment
have frequently been obli|ged
to di&s;place and di&s;mi&s;s them
<PB N="5" REF="6">
from their Share in the Manage|ment;
and the King has at &s;everal
Times remov'd mo&s;t of them from
his Councils and Service, and that
not without due Re&s;entment again&s;t
their Conduct; NOW as this di&s;|plac'd
Circum&s;tance is greatly their
Di&s;advantage, as a Party, and to
their per&s;onal Mortification al&s;o; &s;o
it has not been thought to be the ea|&s;ie&s;t
to them of any thing in the
World; and therefore it will &s;ur|prize
no Body to hear that they
have, upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, laid
their Heads together, and joyn'd
their Intere&s;ts, in Order to retrieve
their Affairs, and if po&s;&s;ible to re|place
them&s;elves in the Favour of the
Sovereign, and by Con&s;equence in
their ancient Intere&s;ts and Employ|ments.</P>
<P>Nor
will it &s;eem &s;trange, that they
have taken into their Con&s;ultations,
and made a Confidence with &s;ome,
who have not been &s;o famous for
favouring the Revolution, as they
them&s;elves have been; tho' per|haps
they may not have come over
to the Jacobite Principle for all that;</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
It was &s;ome time ago, that the
Heads of this Party began to con|cert
their Mea&s;ures one with another,
for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing their Intere&s;ts,
and had not the Rebellion interven'd,
they had no Que&s;tion gone about it
much &s;ooner; But as Friends are
tryed by the Circum&s;tances which
tho&s;e are in who want them, &s;o it
was here.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved here, that
the&s;e <HI>Revolution Tories,</HI> have at di|vers
Times, played divers Sorts of
Games, &s;till aiming at the &s;ame End,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Re&s;toration of their In|tere&s;ts:
For Example; while the Court
proceeded in the ordinary Mea&s;ures
of the Admini&s;tration, they could
take none but ordinary Mea&s;ures to
introduce them&s;elves; but when the
Government &s;eem'd alarm'd, and
that a Rebellion appear'd in the
Heart of his Maje&s;ties Dominions:
they apparently acted an extraordi|nary
Part, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> they &s;et up
for a Kind of Neutrality in Poli|ticks,
<HI>as if they had told us,</HI> that they
wanted only to &s;ee if the Rebellion
&s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o turn
<PB N="7" REF="8">
into a <HI>Revolution;</HI> in which Ca&s;e they
&s;tood ready, as it might be &s;aid, to
plead Merit with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and
extenuate their taking part with the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by &s;hewing, upon
the weak and pa&s;&s;ive Part they had
acted, and how little Service they had
done: On the other Hand, if the
Rebellion fail'd, as they had rea&s;on
to believe it would, they had held
them&s;elves, as if in Appearance they
had been Friends to the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Hanover,</HI> and then had their Merit
to plead on that Account al&s;o.</P>
<P>This Abridgement of their Poli|ticks,
may receive &s;ome Evidence
from their pre&s;ent Conduct; and
therefore the following Parts of &s;e|cret
Hi&s;tory is laid open, which in
general, may &s;erve to clear up the
Eye-&s;ight of tho&s;e, who incline to
the old Game of A MOTTLEY
MINISTRY.</P>
<P>It was at a Hou&s;e bearing the
Name of one of the mo&s;t ancient
Kingdoms of the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy,</HI>
where upon a &s;elect Occa&s;ion the
Heads of the abovenamed male|contented
Party are &s;aid to have met,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the Occa&s;ion of the Congre&s;s, as we
are inform'd, was in &s;hort this.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Government had
thought fit upon Occa&s;ions, which
the&s;e Gentlemen e&s;teem'd TRI|FLING
and MEAN, to di&s;place,
as before, almo&s;t all the&s;e who we
call <HI>Revolution Tories;</HI> and had di&s;|mi&s;s'd
them from their Employments,
Favours, Tru&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a Word, had put
them out of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; and this,
Notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t of them had
declar'd in the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable time,
and in the mo&s;t acceptable Terms,
for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and
had appear'd &s;o hearty in the Inte|re&s;t
of King <HI>George,</HI> that the late
Party thought them irreconcilable,
and the pre&s;ent thought them
&s;incerely engaged in their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This, as it was fir&s;t a little &s;trange
to the People without Doors; &s;o the
Gentlemen complain'd of it, as high|ly
unju&s;t, and as in it &s;elf ingrate.
It is true, good Manners, and &s;ome
Principles of Duty, oblig'd them not
to reflect per&s;onally upon the King;
they therefore, according to the
old way, of laying all upon the Backs
<PB N="9" REF="10">
of evil Councellors, thought fit to
charge it as a Crime upon the pre|&s;ent
Mini&s;try; and after many private
and &s;ome publick Exclamations,
which by the way made them much
acquainted with each other's Re|&s;entment,
they came thereby to
communicate to one another their
Grievances, and at length to re&s;olve
upon clo&s;er Con&s;ultations for the
Remedies, and upon what were the
mo&s;t proper Mea&s;ures to do them|&s;elves
Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Before we enter far into their
Mea&s;ures, it &s;eems needful that we
&s;hould know &s;omething of the Per|&s;ons,
and e&s;pecially a little of the
Characters of tho&s;e, who were the
chief Movers in the Machine, which
was now form'd, and in this we
que&s;tion not to make the De&s;cripti|ons
&s;o plain, as that there need be
no Occa&s;ion for Names, in the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Part of the en&s;uing Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> was an eminent Per&s;on
of the fir&s;t Rank of Peers; it was
hard to &s;ay, whether his ancient
Hou&s;e, and the Dignity of his Birth,
or the high Stations he had been in
<PB N="10" REF="11">
under &s;everal Monarchs, had given
him the greater E&s;teem of him&s;elf:
but it &s;eems that this over rating
his own Merit, had been for 28
Years a &s;tated Rea&s;on for his not &s;uf|fering
any of his Sovereigns to conti|nue
long in his Favour; and by Con|&s;equence,
for his not being long in
theirs: He had indeed &s;ome valuable
Things in him, yet he rather was
thought wi&s;e, than was really &s;o;
and his Want of Con&s;tancy, in either
the wor&s;t, or the be&s;t of things, cau|&s;ed
him to pa&s;s neither for the wor&s;t
or the be&s;t of Men: He had not &s;o
little Fore&s;ight as not to joyn with
every ri&s;ing Side; but had &s;o little
Courage, as never to ri&s;que any
thing for the be&s;t of them: As long
as things run &s;mooth, the Mini&s;try
<HI>for the Time being,</HI> were &s;ure of him;
and when they ceas'd to do &s;o, they
were as &s;ure to lo&s;e him: The King
found him in the Place of Prime
Mini&s;ter, but he declar'd him&s;elf un|equal
to the Weight of that Em|ployment;
not for want of Capacity,
&s;o much as want of Application:
Indolence &s;o engro&s;s'd him, that he
<PB N="11" REF="12">
could rather bear the Reproach of
Impotence, than the Fatigue of Bu|&s;ine&s;s:
Thus he found him&s;elf in&s;en|&s;ibly
drop out of the publick Affairs,
and made him&s;elf a meer Invalid
in his Countries Service.</P>
<P>He had been ea&s;y enough in this
State, thro' the exce&s;&s;ive Love of
his own Quiet, nor could the Noti|on
of being &s;lighted affect him; be|ing
above it in Fortune, and below
it in Pa&s;&s;ion; if the re&s;tle&s;s Impor|tunities
of the mo&s;t impertinent good
Wife in the World, had not hurried
him out of a State of Negligence,
next Door to Stupidity, to the Cir|cum&s;tance
of a Malecontent, even to
a Degree, next Door to a criminal
Di&s;affection.</P>
<P>He had marry'd a Wife in a Coun|try
famous for politick Beauties;
whence he had brought Home a
Lady, who mu&s;t be thought eminent
for the fir&s;t, &s;ince without the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of the la&s;t, &s;he found Means
to remove her &s;elf from an abandon|ed
Condition, to the Arms of a Man
of Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
This Lady, of whom <HI>Fame</HI> tells
us, that &s;he was born laughing, and
bred up to talk to Kings and prin|ces,
as familiarly as they to their
Lap-Dogs; finding it would not do
in our Court, had liked to have
turned Malecontent before her
Lord; but as &s;he was impatient of
an outed-Condition when &s;he was
reduced to it, &s;he never left laughing
and &s;hewing her Teeth, till &s;he
made him re&s;olve to &s;et all the
Wheels he could think of a going,
to work him&s;elf into the Admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>It
was this <HI>Monoculus,</HI> who follow|ing
and teizing the re&s;t of his Male|content
Friends, brought them to
appoint this Congre&s;s, to con&s;ider of
their Affairs, the manner of which
may be as in&s;tructing in the Di&s;co|very,
as the Thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P>It was one Morning early, when
with his Head full of Chagrin, and
of mi&s;chievous Re&s;olutions, <HI>Monoculus</HI>
was gone abroad, uncertain whether
to guide his Thoughts, and to whom
to break the Di&s;contents, which yet
he was too big with to retain; when
<PB N="13" REF="14">
driving in his Coach by the King's
old ruin'd Palace, he met NIGRO|QUE,
an old di&s;carded State&s;man,
and a mo&s;t natural Malecontent, ju&s;t
coming out at the Gate, <HI>for it &s;eems
he lived within the Palace:</HI> he was
reading a long Scroul, containing
a Li&s;t of Names, and had not
&s;een his Grace, but that the latter
making a Motion towards him, and
&s;topping his Coachman, my Lord's
Coachman &s;topt al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Nigroque,</HI> neither in Dignity or
Antiquity of Blood equal to <HI>Mono|culus,</HI>
was neverthele&s;s <HI>a Peer;</HI> his
Family had rai&s;ed them&s;elves one
Generation only before him, and that,
as was &s;aid, from the meane&s;t Part
of the Practice of the Law, by which
Means we find him a Cou&s;in Ger|man
to the <HI>Plebeii,</HI> being two Re|moves
only from <HI>nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to this Original, he was
noble by Birth, rather than Di&s;po|&s;ition:
as he was a States-man by
Office, rather than Capacity: He had
newly made an Attempt to be ho|ne&s;t,
but per&s;onated the Patriot &s;o
awkwardly, that the Di&s;gui&s;e was
<PB N="14" REF="15">
a Burthen to him&s;elf, and like <HI>David</HI>
in <HI>Saul</HI>'s Armour, he was unea&s;y
till he was reduced to his State of
Nature: as he had not Skill enough
to keep him&s;elf conceal'd, &s;o he had
not worth enough to keep him&s;elf
employed; the King, who wanted
no forced Friends, and feared no Ene|mies,
had &s;uffered the Encumbrance
of him in his Council, in hopes, by
the Advantages of being faithful, to
bring him to the Love of it; But
finding him incorrigible, delivered
him&s;elf from one, who made no o|ther
U&s;e of his Favour, than to &s;hew
every Body that he knew not how
to de&s;erve it: His highe&s;t Ambition
&s;eem'd to center in two Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
To be rich, and a Politician: The
fir&s;t he obtain'd, <HI>if Fame lies not,</HI> at
the Expence of &s;ome Morals; the
la&s;t he fail'd in, as mo&s;t Men do,
who attempt things in Spight of
Nature: We have rarely heard him
blam'd for want of Devotion, but
often have heard it que&s;tioned, whe|ther
it was in him the Product of
Ignorance or Super&s;tition, <HI>be that as
it will,</HI> his Exce&s;s that way has en|titled
<PB N="15" REF="16">
him to two Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to
be the mo&s;t bigotted, and the mo&s;t
Prie&s;t-ridden Peer in the three King|doms;
both which a&s;&s;i&s;ted him much
in his pre&s;ent di&s;contented Circum|&s;tances,
and particularly as it gave
him an Opportunity to li&s;t him&s;elf
in the Service of the <HI>High Church,</HI>
which is at pre&s;ent in a State of
Humiliation; his Lord&s;hip being
wonderfully qualified thereby, as
well as by his natural Complection, to
talk DISMALLY, about her pre|&s;ent
Circum&s;tances, and to e&s;pou&s;e
her in the Quality of a Knight Er|rant:
It was in this Service that he
had long been employed to make
as many of his Acquaintance as he
could, be as malecontent as him&s;elf;
in which Work he be&s;tirred him&s;elf
Night and Day, with the &s;ame Di|ligence
which he was &s;o fam'd for
in a certain Office, where, it was ob|&s;erved,
he was always mo&s;t employ|ed,
where there was lea&s;t to do.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e
great De&s;igns for the Church, he
had drawn out a long and double
Li&s;t, of which we &s;hall &s;ay more in
<PB N="16" REF="17">
its turn; it is &s;ufficient for the pre|&s;ent,
to mention the Title, which was
drectly thus:

your Li&s;t are concerned in this weigh|ty
Affair.</P>
</SP>
<P>This &s;hort Conver&s;ation being
over, the new Allies, after mutual
A&s;&s;urances of Friend&s;hip and Con|fidence,
&s;eparated for a Time; <HI>Mo|noculus</HI>
went immediately back to his
<HI>Italian</HI> with the News, and gave her
a full and di&s;tinct Account of what
had pa&s;&s;ed; &s;he began to grin as &s;oon
as he but named the Per&s;on, but
<PB N="28" REF="31">
laughed &s;o loud, when he came to
the Story of the Li&s;t, and the two
Columns, that as familiar as her
Tittillations are to his Grace, he
could not but be a little interrupt|ed
with them: whereupon he pre&s;|&s;ed
her to abate a while, that he
might fini&s;h the Relation, but it was
in vain; &s;o he withdrew and left
her laughing.</P>
<P>But to return to the diligent Gen|tleman
we talked of: <HI>Monoculus</HI>
was no &s;ooner in his Coach, but
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> pur&s;ued the Progre&s;s he was
upon before; this was to go to a
certain Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, who his Lord|&s;hip
had of late renewed his Intima|$y
with; for between them the
Intere&s;ts of the Church were con|&s;tantly
taken Care of, <HI>after their man|ner:</HI>
This was the indefatigable Fa|ther
in God, <HI>Oracle</HI> Bi&s;hop of .....
This <HI>Oracle</HI> was a Bi&s;hop of the
la&s;t Promotion, and if modern Pro|phets
err not in VISION, his will
be the la&s;t Promotion of the Kind:
He had the Fame of a compleat State
Firebrand before his Exaltation, and
&s;ome have &s;aid of him, that his Share
<PB N="29" REF="32">
in the Pontificate, has but very little
abated the Acrimony of his Brains:
His Zeal for the Church, it &s;eems,
made him le&s;s a Friend to the <HI>Hano|ver</HI>
Succe&s;&s;ion, than he might other|wi&s;e
have been; being convinced,
that if that Family came to the
Crown, the Plague of Moderation,
which High-Church Men have gene|rally
in all Ages had an Aver&s;ion to,
would break out upon the Church,
and &s;pread over her whole Body,
to the Ruin of her Con&s;titution, and
of all tho&s;e who expected to tyran|nize
under her Protection, and by
her Authority: Be&s;ides this, it was
his profe&s;&s;ed Opinion, that the Pro|te&s;tant
Church of <HI>England,</HI> might
be very &s;afe under a Popi&s;h Pre|tender:
and that if not, the pre&s;erv|ing
that Succe&s;&s;ion was of &s;o much
more Moment, than pre&s;erving the
Church, that we ought to run the
Ri&s;que of the latter, to &s;ecure the
former: This Reverend Per&s;on was
now become the <HI>Oracle</HI> of the High-Church
Party, and had their E&s;teem
mo&s;t, for tho&s;e very things which
recommended him lea&s;t; he was, if
<PB N="30" REF="33">
Fame flatters him not, a Man of po|lite
Parts, but generally was thought
more of a State&s;man than a Chri|&s;tian,
more a Courtier, than a
Churchman; and more a Scholar,
than a Gentleman: His Zeal in
publick Matters was as warm, as
in religious Matters cold, and it
was thought, he would &s;ooner be a
Martyr for his politick Principles,
than his Religious; hence Whigs in
the State, were more his Horror,
than Hereticks in the Church; and
he was far more eager to extirpate
Republicans, than Socinians.</P>
<P>From hence al&s;o it came to pa&s;s,
that he was not only hearty in the
pre&s;ent De&s;ign, but was the Spring,
and fir&s;t Mover of the whole Work,
the Axis upon which it all turn'd,
and the Engineer by whom the
whole Scheme was laid, NIGROQ.
was indeed a good Second, and be|came
next to ORACLE, the grand
Wheel in the Movement; But
ORACLE was the chief.</P>
<P>As he had contriv'd the intended
Congre&s;s, in the Affair now to be
&s;poken of, &s;o he had not been want|ing
<PB N="31" REF="34">
to find proper Per&s;ons to form
the A&s;&s;embly, and had Agents rea|dy
on all Hands to fill it up, to what
Number might be found proper;
the Names which <HI>Nigroq.</HI> had drawn
up in a Li&s;t, were of his collecting,
the Characters of his giving, he had
&s;ounded the Depth, and tryed the
Temper of many of them, and as
he determin'd, more or le&s;s Weight
was put upon them, in the pre&s;ent
Affair: his Pains were indefatigable
in bringing over to his De&s;igns tho&s;e
who he thought might be u&s;eful,
and in managing Tempers, he had
&s;uch a Skill, that like Sathan, he al|ways
took hold of Men by the right
Handle.</P>
<P><HI>Buquinquhan,</HI> a Peer of the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite cunning, was a Pro&s;titute
to his Wit; in Spight of in&s;ufferable
Pride, and pretended Gravity; that
Duke &s;ubmitted to be managed by
his Dexterity; he made him &s;eem
pious, in Spight of an e&s;tabli&s;hed
Character to the contrary, and &s;et
him up to act for the Church, who
wanted the very fir&s;t Notions of
any thing that was religious.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35">
<HI>Oracle</HI> knew, this politick Peer
would neither &s;erve them, or any one
el&s;e, further than by oppo&s;ing his
Intere&s;t to the Mini&s;try, in the or|dinary
Cour&s;e, but would fail them
or trick them in any further Depen|dencies;
&s;o that he was too wary to
expect, and too cautious to de&s;ire
his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a publick and par|ticular
manner; but as he was a
Man of Council, he thought he
might be &s;ingularly u&s;eful: in the
more clo&s;e Con&s;ultations which they
had now re&s;olv'd to enter upon, for
the carrying on their Affairs; Be|&s;ides
which, ORACLE working
too and fro' in his Mind, what u&s;e
was to be made of this Engine, who
tho' too weildy to be turn'd about
at Will, yet by its own perver&s;e
Tendency, inclin'd always to move
Retrograde to the publick Good,
if he mov'd at all; he at la&s;t
marked out the Orbit of his Motion,
appointed him to be the Head of
the dead Weight for the Church,
and kept him in Petto for a Re&s;erve,
when the Battle &s;hould be be|gun.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">
It occur'd to this Church Politici|an,
that &s;ome Advantage might
be made for their new Mea&s;ures,
from the Di&s;contents of a certain
Northern Peer, who was lately di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
from great Po&s;ts in the Go|vernment,
as well Military as Ci|vil:
and it was not a little Pains
that he took, to get proper Agents
to improve the Chagrin they ex|pected
to find him in, at a Treat|ment,
which, without Que&s;tion,
was in its Nature &s;urpri&s;ing, as it
might be in its Circum&s;tances &s;ud|den
and unexpected; But as this
was a nice Point to manage, &s;o the
Reverend Father dur&s;t tru&s;t no
Body with it but him&s;elf: but he
met with a Repul&s;e, as we &s;hall

<P>The mu&s;tering up of Agents was
the fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s in Order to &s;ettle
a Juncto for their farther Con&s;ul|tations,
and he had been, <HI>as it may
be &s;aid, defeated</HI> in the two la&s;t men|tioned,
one being not worth having,
and the other not to be had.</P>
<P><HI>Nabuzaradan</HI> was the next Man;
he was eminent for his Birth,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
Wealth, and many good Qualities;
his Hone&s;ty was thought to be &s;o
much greater than his Capacity,
that he was believed to be much
fitter to be tru&s;ted, than employed:
his Temper qualified him for a male|content,
being much &s;ooner offended
than reconcil'd, and was peculiar in
the Manner of his Chri&s;tianity, in
that, tho' he might &s;ometimes for|give
an Injury, it was rarely known
that he would ever forget it: had
he been as capable of revenging, as
he was of re&s;enting, no Man that
had ever di&s;oblig'd him, could have
been &s;afe: but as his ill Temper
prevail'd enough in him, to make
him very apt to be angry, &s;o his
good Temper had always Power
enough to keep him from doing
Mi&s;chief: The Height of the Sta|tion
from which he fell was great,
the Fall it &s;elf precipitate, and cir|cum&s;tanced
as much to fire his Re|&s;entment,
as could be de&s;ir'd: But
as his private Fortunes were great,
and qualified him to fall ea&s;y, &s;o
they a&s;&s;i&s;ted to keep him &s;o; in a
Word, he had more Gall than

Spleen, knew how to be angry, but
not how to be envious; his Genius
was above foul Method of re&s;toring
him&s;elf, and a little below the Ma|nagement

by the Sorcerer that attack'd him,

even again&s;t Inclination; for being once
in the Circle, and taught to &s;peak the

Fate, and to every Member to bring
&s;uch as they found fitte&s;t for their

<P>It is &s;aid among &s;ome, who pretend

<P>That we may avoid Preambles, in

U&s;age, which, he &s;aid, he was &s;en&s;ible
many of the Per&s;ons there pre&s;ent had
received: notwith&s;tanding the good
<PB N="37" REF="40">
Services they had done, in adhering to
the pre&s;ent Intere&s;t, and notwith&s;tand|ing
they had been &s;o in&s;trumental in
pre&s;erving the Succe&s;&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent
King and his Hou&s;e: He was about
to touch upon the Ea&s;ine&s;s of their
having &s;ecur'd to them&s;elves better
U&s;age, if they had thought fit to
have e&s;pou&s;ed another Intere&s;t; but,
as he &s;aid, he mentioned it at that
time, not to bring any Thing relating to
that other Intere&s;t into their pre&s;ent
Debates, their Eyes being now upon
differing Objects: but to give them a
due Sen&s;e of their own Merit, and of
what Rea&s;on they had to expect other
things from tho&s;e, who had the Pow|er
now in their Hands.</P>
<P>He told them, he would not in his
Introduction give his private Thoughts
of what they were now to con&s;ult
of, which he &s;hould &s;peak to more
di&s;tinctly after they had made &s;ome
Entrance into their Bu&s;ine&s;s; he only
told them, the grand Affair before
them was, to look into the State of
the Nation, the State of the Church,
their own private Intere&s;t, and what it
was they were now to do, in Order to
<PB N="38" REF="41">
retrieve things in general, &s;ave their
Country from Ruin, and the Church
from impending De&s;truction; he en|couraged
them to be vigorous in their
Re&s;olves, plain and open in their Opi|nions,
and a&s;&s;ured them, that as he had
an entire Confidence in the Honour
and Sincerity of every one who was
there, and &s;hould &s;peak with the
greate&s;t Freedom in whatever he
&s;hould &s;ay to them, &s;o he hoped they
would have the &s;ame Confidence one
in another, that this was no Time to
be backward or diffident, their Cir|cum&s;tances
were not &s;o de&s;perate, as
to be pa&s;t hope of Retrieve, or &s;o
forward as not to want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
their Friends: and as they were not met
here to form any In&s;urrection, or to
break in upon the Repo&s;e of the Pub|lick;
but only to think of Methods
within the Compa&s;s of their Duty
and Allegiance to the King, to whom
they had all taken the Oaths; and to
re&s;tore the Admini&s;tration into &s;uch
Hands, as might put a Stop to the
Oppre&s;&s;ions they laboured under, and
pre&s;erve the Church and the civil Go|vernment
al&s;o in a flouri&s;hing and
<PB N="39" REF="42">
&s;afe Condition, which he believ'd
they all would allow was far from
the pre&s;ent State of Things.</P>
<P>Hereupon he &s;at down, beckning
to <HI>Nigroq.</HI> to &s;peak his Mind, who
&s;tanding up, and directing his Speech
to the Bi&s;hop, &s;eem'd to go on where
his Lord&s;hip left off: &startq;My Lord, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> I was glad to hear your Lord|&s;hip
mention, that we are not met
here upon di&s;honourable or di&s;loyal
De&s;igns, for this is agreeable to my
Notion of the Thing, we are not
going to levy War, or rai&s;e Rebel|lion;
we have nothing to &s;ay of the
Government it &s;elf, or the Per&s;on
of the King: When we come to
tran&s;act any Thing with, or relating
to the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty, I be|lieve
every one here would act as
becomes him. I &s;ee &s;everal Per&s;ons
of Honour here, who have always
&s;poken honourably and dutifully of
the King, and have &s;erved him faith|fully,
and are ready to do &s;o again,
when his Maje&s;ty &s;hall plea&s;e to open
the Door, that they may do it, as
they think they ought.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43">
&startq;But it is our Misfortune, that we
cannot have the &s;ame Opinion of
tho&s;e, into who&s;e Hands the Admi|ni&s;tration
of Affairs is now entru&s;t|ed,
which we had formerly. We
think they neither act wi&s;ely or
faithfully; we think neither Church
nor State &s;afe in &s;uch Hands: e&s;peci|ally,
my Lord, <HI>&s;aid he, directing his
Speech again to the Bi&s;hop,</HI> the
Church can never be &s;ecure in &s;uch
Mea&s;ures as the&s;e Men take, di&s;|couraging
the zealous Defenders of
her Intere&s;t, who have given many
Years Te&s;timony of their Fidelity
to her Cau&s;e, and Zeal for her Wor|&s;hip
and Authority, harbouring, nou|ri&s;hing,
and &s;upporting Phanaticks
and Presbyterians, gratifying the
Di&s;&s;enters upon all Occa&s;ions, &s;top|ping
legal Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t &s;uch
of them, as by their vile Pamphlets
in&s;ult the Church, of which we have
&s;o many Examples, that we need not,
as well as have not Time, to enter
into Particulars: and therefore our
Bu&s;ine&s;s, as I take it, is, to con&s;ider
of Men&s;ures to get &s;uch Hands re|moved
from the King, or, as we
<PB N="41" REF="44">
u&s;ually expre&s;s it, to have the King
put into better Hands. I need not
explain my &s;elf, my Lord, I believe
there is none in this honourable
Company but under&s;tands: here he
made a Bow to all the Lords round,
who&s;e Number by this Time was en|crea&s;ed
to no le&s;s than eleven, includ|ing
<HI>Monoculus</HI> and two Lords who he
had bought in with him.&endq;</P>
<P>One of the&s;e taking the Hint from
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> carryed on the Di&s;cour&s;e,
tho with a little more Warmth
than the other: He complimented
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> upon his conci&s;e Method, in
opening the Ca&s;e with an Eloquence,
as he &s;aid, peculiar to his Illu&s;trious
Family, and upon his coming &s;o di|rectly
to the Point in hand; he feli|citated
him&s;elf upon his being ad|mitted
to a Conference among Per|&s;ons
&s;o entirely affected to their com|mon
Intere&s;t, and to their Country's
Good, and e&s;pecially to the Safety
and Honour of the Church: at which
Words, he made a Bow to the <HI>Ora|cle;</HI>
but more particularly he ble&s;s'd
his Fate, that he came in Time to hear
his Lord&s;hip lead them by the
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Hand, &s;o plainly to the Bu&s;ine&s;s they
were met about, he told them, that it
had this Effect upon him, and believ'd
it had the &s;ame upon all the re&s;t:
That they had now nothing to do, but
to enter upon Mea&s;ures, for bringing
to pa&s;s a new Turn among the Mana|gers
of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;etting
proper In&s;truments at work for bring|ing
it to pa&s;s: That true it was, &s;ome
Mea&s;ures had been wrong taken, and
&s;ome Men had carried things too far:
but yet he hoped there might be &s;ome
Steps yet to be taken, which might
bring about what they de&s;ir'd, if not
pre&s;ently, yet in a rea&s;onable Time:
and he de&s;ir'd that every one would
give their Advice with Freedom in
the pre&s;ent Exigence, and that they
might be led into no more Precipitati|ons:
That their Strength was not
broken, tho' they were as it were
di&s;arm'd; and that they had many
ways to render them&s;elves con&s;idera|ble,
if not formidable, to the Court
Party; and that this was their pre&s;ent
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> &s;poke next, and &s;aid he
was &s;o plea&s;ed with what that noble
<PB N="43" REF="46">
Lord had &s;aid, and &s;o &s;en&s;ible that he
had dige&s;ted the&s;e Things thoroughly
in his Thoughts, that he could not
but be of the Opinion, that it was the
De&s;ire of the whole Board, that he
would be plea&s;ed to go on, and that
he would enter into &s;uch Explanati|ons,
of what he had &s;ugge&s;ted in ge|neral,
as his Lord&s;hip &s;hall think pro|per;
all the Lords bowed at the
Word, &s;ignifying their A&s;&s;ent, upon
which the other proceeded; He told
them &s;ince it was their Plea&s;ure he
&s;hould explain him&s;elf, he did it wil|lingly,
in Hopes it would lead them
into the Bottom of their De&s;ign, and
that they would &s;peak their Thoughts
$reely, as they came to the particulars;
he told them that as to the wrong
Mea&s;ures which had been taken,
he thought he need not to have ex|plained
it; their Lord&s;hips knew very
well that &s;ome Gentlemen, who were
heartily in the Intere&s;t, had driven
things on to an open Rupture, which
was quite foreign to the thing: That
their Bu&s;ine&s;s had been to have knit
them&s;elves in a &s;olid Intere&s;t at Court,
where they might have gradually,
<PB N="44" REF="47">
and wi&s;ely, yet &s;ilently and &s;a$ely
have proceeded; that every Man they
gain'd there was better than a Regi|ment
beaten in the Field; that this
E&s;tabli&s;hment was too firmly fixed,
to be cut up with the Sword; the mak|ing
a formidable Appearance at Court,
and in the Parliament, was better to
them, and a likelier way to Succe&s;s,
than rai&s;ing an Army: That they had
rather have a Majority of ten in the
Hou&s;e of Lords, or Commons, than of
Ten Thou&s;and in the Field; and had
much better bring over one Privy-Coun&s;ellor,
than take the &s;tronge&s;t
Garri&s;on in <HI>Britain</HI> by Storm; &startq;that
therefore taking to Arms was the
wronge&s;t Step in the World, and
&s;erved only to ruin their Friends,
not encrea&s;e them; to make their
Work more difficult, not more ea|&s;y:
That it was all owing to the
Precipitation of People abroad, who
were not only impatient of their own
Misfortunes, but apt to promi&s;e
more from their Intere&s;ts there, and
expect more from their Friends here,
than either they were capable, or
than ever it was probable they &s;hould
<PB N="45" REF="48">
produce: He told them, that it was
his Opinion, that rai&s;ing a War, was
what their Enemies de&s;ired above
all things, as the &s;ure&s;t Way to over|throw
the private Intere&s;t which
they &s;aw was too growing; and tho'
he would not believe his Maje&s;ty
could entertain &s;uch cruel Thoughts
to a Nation, that he expected &s;hould
one time or other be peaceably his
own; yet he could an&s;wer for it,
that they were not a few that de|&s;ired
a Conque&s;t, rather than an Union
of Parties; that placed all their
Expectation of their own Settlement
upon the De&s;truction of the Gen|try,
Nobility, and Clergy, of the
other Side; and to fly to Arms, was
the greate&s;t Gratification of tho&s;e
Peoples De&s;ire that could be; that
he thought the Friends of tho&s;e A|broad,
pu&s;hed us upon playing a
de&s;perate Game at Home, before
our Circum&s;tances were reduced to
the Nece&s;&s;ity of it; that it was ap|parent
things went well enough on
before, and nothing &s;eemed to
&s;tand in the way of their growing
Expectations, till &s;ome impatient
<PB N="46" REF="49">
People broke out into Tumults and
Rabbles, and &s;o by Con&s;equence to
Arms, before their Friends were
ready for them: That the Rebellion
was a Plot defeated, not a War de|&s;igned,
like the Story of the Gun|powder
Trea&s;on, where when <HI>Faux</HI>
was taken, and the Mine under the
<HI>Parliament Hou&s;e</HI> di&s;covered, the
re&s;t de&s;perately run to Arms, with|out
Probability of Succe&s;s, and were
defeated of Cour&s;e: That the Earl of
<HI>Mar</HI> &s;poiled all the Mea&s;ures at
Home, and the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> A|broad;
and had done ten times
more Service to the Intere&s;t, had
they lain &s;till, as Lord <HI>Boling broke</HI> did,
and advi&s;ed them to do; he re|ferred
it to their Lord&s;hips to look
back upon the Po&s;ture their Affairs
were in before the&s;e unhappy Mea|&s;ures
were entred into: <HI>Was not,</HI>
my Lords, continued he, <HI>the Coun|try
all our own? in &s;ome Counties, the
Clergy, the Gentry, ours to a Man?
Did not the Di&s;affection encrea&s;e in
all Places to our Satisfaction? Was not
the Country every where alarmed,
with the evident Dangers of the
<PB N="47" REF="50">
Church? And could we de&s;ire to &s;tand
in a better Po&s;ture at Court for the
Time it held? Were not many of us
in the Admini&s;tration, at lea&s;t in the
Councils and Cabinet? Were we not
po&s;ted within Doors, where we &s;aw
every thing that was done, and knew
every Step that was taken, and knew
thereby how to &s;uit things without
Doors to the great Event we aimed
at? Was not this,,</HI> my Lords, <HI>a pro|mi&s;ing
Scene? Were we not encrea&s;ing
every Day in Numbers, and Inte|re&s;t?
What need was there of Pre|cipitations
and Ruptures, to put Arms
into our Enemies Hands with which
to de&s;troy our Friends, when we might
have gradually and &s;ilently done all
at Home, and have at la&s;t given the</HI>
Coup de Grace <HI>at our own Plea|&s;ure</HI>?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He put them in Mind, how the
Tumults fir&s;t, and the War after|wards,
effectually broke into their
Mea&s;ures: how the falling upon the
Meeting-Hou&s;es, inflamed all the
Di&s;&s;enters at one Blow again&s;t them,
ju&s;t &s;aid he, when we had laid a
Scheme either effectually to have
<PB N="48" REF="51">
brought them in to be Malecontents,
or at lea&s;t to have divided them a|mong
them&s;elves, and &s;o have had
them &s;ome on one Side, &s;ome on the
other, <HI>which was,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to make
them be perfectly u&s;ele&s;s to both.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we made the be&s;t
of that Affair, by putting forward as
much as po&s;&s;ible that Vote of rebuilding
the Di&s;&s;enters Meeting-Hou&s;es at the
publick Expence, which we afterwards
fail'd not to improve in the Country,
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gentlemen and
Clergy, to &s;atisfie the People that the
Church could never be thought to be
the Concern of tho&s;e, who &s;o publickly
e&s;pou&s;ed her Enemies the Presbyteri|ans.</P>
<P>&startq;However he added, that this went
but a little way, compared to the
Injury that tho&s;e Tumults did, by
carrying the Di&s;&s;enters and all the
moderate Gentlemen away from them,
and therefore as he told them, they
could not but remember, they were
fain to conceal their Thoughts, and
joyn in again&s;t Rabbles of all Kinds
in general, as Things which all
Men, who de&s;ir'd to pre&s;erve the
<PB N="49" REF="52">
Peace of their Country mu&s;t equally
abhor; he told them it was plain
they were driven to the &s;ame Exi|gence
by the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and others
taking up Arms, which was indeed
the Ruin of all their De&s;igns; and
which they could not but declare
again&s;t, and joyn their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to
oppo&s;e, unle&s;s they would have been
ruin'd with them, and have put
them&s;elves into the &s;ame Predica|ment
with tho&s;e in Arms: he told
them, by that one ra&s;h Enter|pri&s;e,
abundance of the Gentry,
who would have been more u&s;eful
another way, were en&s;nar'd, hurried
into Jayls, or driven to declare
them&s;elves in meer De&s;peration, as
was the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>For&s;ter</HI> and
others in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Sir <HI>W&mdash;W&mdash;</HI>
Mr. <HI>H&mdash;</HI> and &s;everal o|thers
at Home, to the weakning the
Intere&s;t, on which better Mea&s;ures
were laid, and to the putting a full
Stop to all the Schemes they had
then laid for the propagating an
Intere&s;t another way.&endq;</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o lively, &s;o
much to the Purpo&s;e, and touched
<PB N="50" REF="53">
them all &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, that it was ea|&s;ily
&s;een, even in the very Countenan|ces
of the whole Body, that it was
very agreeable to them: and fre|quently,
upon his offering to &s;top, they
cryed, <HI>Go on, my Lord, Pray go on, my
Lord.</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>Pray, my Lords,
let &s;ome Body give their Opinions as
well as I;</HI> &s;ays one that &s;at right
again&s;t him, <HI>you &s;peak all our Opinions,
we entreat you to go on, my Lord;</HI> upon
the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ings, he continued his Di&s;|cour&s;e,
and &startq;told them, one of the
great Mi&s;chiefs the&s;e Tumults and
this Rebellion, <HI>for &s;uch he &s;aid it
was to them, as well as to the Govern|ment,</HI>
had brought upon them, were
the repealing the <HI>Triennial Bill,</HI>
for as for that of &s;u&s;pending the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, though it fell
heavy upon &s;ome of their Friends,
yet he told them they could not
blame the Court for taking that
Step, and that it was nothing but
what every Government had done
in their Turn, and would, and ought
to do again upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions;
and being temporary, would influ|ence
Matters but a little while;
<PB N="51" REF="54">
<HI>But this cur&s;ed Septennial Law,</HI> &s;aid
he, <HI>your Lord&s;hips are &s;en&s;ible has
ruined us all;</HI> Before that, <HI>he told
them,</HI> they had &s;ome View of retrie|ving
the Mi&s;chiefs which the wrong
Steps of the Rebellion and Rabbling
had brought upon them; and tho'
they had lo&s;t &s;ome Friends, and ma|ny
had brought them&s;elves into &s;uch
Circum&s;tances, as they could not
own them without manife&s;t Dan|ger,
yet they had cultivated the
general Di&s;affection to &s;uch a De|gree,
that upon a new Election of
Parliament, they made no doubt to
have given a new Turn to the
Gentlemen at Court, and to have
let his Maje&s;ty &s;ee, THAT <HI>the Inte|re&s;t
of the Church did not lye where
&s;ome People had placed it:</HI> THAT <HI>the</HI>
High-Party <HI>were not &s;o de&s;picable an
Intere&s;t as they had been repre&s;ented:</HI>
THAT <HI>it was not &s;afe to &s;light them,
as &s;ome Men would have them &s;light|ed:</HI>
and in a Word, <HI>THAT it was
his Intere&s;t to &s;hift Hands in the Ad|mini&s;tration,
if he would effectually
regain the Affection of his Subjects.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">
He went on here relating &s;ome of
the &s;ecret Mea&s;ures they had laid for
a Court Revolution, which, at pre|&s;ent,
our Author cannot &s;o exactly re|member,
but &s;ays he repeated them
much more regularly afterwards in
the Mea&s;ures he propo&s;ed for their
future Conduct, and therefore they
were omitted in this Part, he conclud|ed
thus: <HI>But,</HI> my Lords, <HI>the Court
falling upon this unlucky Expedient,
has broken all tho&s;e Mea&s;ures;</HI> at lea&s;t <HI>it
has adjourned them for five Years; which
is a terrible Length for Expectations, in
which we have &s;o much Rea&s;on to be im|patient.</HI></P>
<P>Having gone this Length, he made
a little Stop, and then told them, &startq;that
to be &s;hort, their pre&s;ent Work was
not to be di&s;couraged by any Di&s;ap|pointment
they had met with; but to
re&s;tore the Breach by effectual Ap|plications,
and to enter into &s;peedy
Mea&s;ures for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves
at Court, where, he &s;aid, it was his
Opinion, if they could but once
make their Way again into the Ad|mini&s;iration,
the Credit and Inte|re&s;t
of their Party in the Country
<PB N="53" REF="56">
would encrea&s;e, and they &s;hould be
in &s;uch a Po&s;ture, as never to be re|duced
again by the Whigs; for that
without the Concurrence of the
King, the Whig Intere&s;t was in it
&s;elf nothing; and if once the Court
came to be made &s;en&s;ible of it, and
to think fit to change Hands,
would dwindle into ju&s;t what it
was before, <HI>viz.</HI> a de&s;picable Faction of
Athei&s;ts, Hereticks, and Presbyteri|ans;
So that upon the whole, he
told them, they had nothing to do
but to endeavour to re&s;tore their
Intere&s;t at Court, and the Game
was all their own; and this he &s;aid
he &s;uppo&s;ed, was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
their pre&s;ent Meeting.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Oracle</HI> had heard this with much
Plea&s;ure, but was &s;o full of the Cau&s;e,
that he had &s;carce Patience to hold:
But my Lord ..... making a full
Stop, he told them, &startq;that they were
now come into the Heart of the
Work; that the Noble Per&s;on who had
been &s;peaking, had clearly &s;tated all
their Preliminaries, and made &s;o full
an Introduction to their Affair, that
nothing remained but to begin im|mediately
<PB N="54" REF="57">
upon the Scheme, and
that as he knew another noble
Lord, who he pointed out, by di|recting
his Speech to him; had
drawn up &s;ome Heads for their
Conduct, and for their pre&s;ent Pro|ceedings,
with the Names of Per|&s;ons,
of whom &s;omething was to be
&s;aid, he hoped his Lord&s;hip would
further open the Conference, by
laying it before them; this was
done, and contained among other
Things, the following Particulars.&endq;</P>
<P>1. To con&s;ider of Per&s;ons proper
to be talked with, and on
whom 'tis probable &s;ome In|fluence
might be expected,
from late Di&s;graces on one
Hand, or little Di&s;coveries of
Di&s;&s;atisfaction on the other.</P>
<P>2. To cultivate the Di&s;&s;atisfacti|ons
of the People in the Coun|try,
and to con&s;ider how to
make the Danger of the Church
more popular.</P>
<P>3. To form a Li&s;t of &s;uch Per|&s;ons,
who on a Turn at Court
are proper to be brought in;
and to acquaint them with
<PB N="55" REF="58">
their being named, as the effe|ctual
Way to make them more
heartily e&s;pou&s;e the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>4. To con&s;ider of &s;ome Per&s;on,
who may with all po&s;&s;ible Re|&s;pect,
getting Acce&s;s to the
King and Prince, counter-act
our Enemies, and fully per|&s;wade
his Maje&s;ty of our being
hearty in his Intere&s;t, as well
as the only Party power|ful
enough to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Heads were read in the
Meeting, they began to look upon
one another, as if they had been in
&s;ome Con&s;ternation, and it was ea&s;y
to &s;ee that their Thoughts concurr'd
in this, <HI>viz.</HI> that they had a difficult
Work before them.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus,</HI> Part of who&s;e Chara|cter,
as has been noted, was to avoid
all things difficult, as well as Things
dangerous, appear'd very de&s;pond|ing
upon the&s;e Propo&s;als: He told them
that he was very &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e
were very ju&s;t Mea&s;ures, but that
&s;ome of them were impracticable,
and e&s;pecially the la&s;t, which related
to the Per&s;on of the King: He &s;aid he
<PB N="56" REF="59">
was very &s;en&s;ible that the Intere&s;t of
the Whigs depended very much upon
the Favour the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try en|joyed
at Court, and the Intere&s;t they
had in the King's good Opinion; and
that on the other Hand it mu&s;t be
acknowledged, the Conduct of the
High Church had been &s;uch, and &s;o
imprudent &s;ince the Acce&s;&s;ion, that
if the King had entertained mean
Thoughts of them before, he mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be confirmed in them now,
and he could a&s;&s;ure them, the Steadi|ne&s;s
of the King to his Intere&s;t was
as firm, as his Judgment to know his
Intere&s;t was clear; and therefore he
could not advi&s;e the making any &s;uch
Attempt upon the King, at lea&s;t till
they were able to &s;upport their
Addre&s;s with one of the&s;e two Things.
1. An Evidence of their Superiority
in Parliament. Or, 2. of &s;ome male
Admini&s;trations in the Mini&s;try; as
to the fir&s;t, they were, he &s;aid, adjourn|ed
by the new Septennial Act, to &s;uch
a Di&s;tance, as that there was no
Room to think of it yet; <HI>as to the la&s;t,</HI>
he did not think it impo&s;&s;ible to bring
to pa&s;s, and &s;hould not be backward
<PB N="57" REF="60">
<HI>when it was,</HI> to improve it to their
Di&s;advantage, even with the King
him&s;elf, as far as Duty and Decency
would permit.</P>
<P>Here a Noble Lord, more fam'd for
Wit than Hone&s;ty, &s;tood up, &s;peaking
in a mo&s;t diverting Stile; &s;aid, MY
LORDS, <HI>I think his</HI> Grace <HI>has put
the Ca&s;e very right, about our Applica|tion
to the King:</HI> indeed we have ma|ny
Rea&s;ons again&s;t it, &startq;his Maje&s;ty
mu&s;t have a better Opinion of us
than he has yet, or perhaps than
we are like to merit from him, be|fore
you can expect any Favour
there: And as we can &s;eek nothing
of the King, but with the utmo&s;t
Re&s;pect, Deference, and Duty; &s;o
I am very loth we &s;hould come to
his Maje&s;ty, as the Gentlemen do
to the <HI>French</HI> King for the blue
Ribband: with <HI>Domine non &s;um
dignus:</HI> If you have any Thing to
charge upon the Mini&s;try that has
Weight in it, I think every one would
go on that Errand, and might be
&s;ure to be heard: But as the King
has too much Sen&s;e of Govern|ment,
not to hear a fair Charge; &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="61">
he has too much Penetration to be
trifled with; but methinks you
&s;hould not think the Mini&s;try &s;uch
infallible People, that they &s;hall ne|ver
be taken in a Mi&s;take; for my
Part, I neither think them &s;o quick,
or you &s;o dull, but that they may
be fir&s;t drawn into a Slip, and then
&s;napt in it.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Hum</HI> &s;ays <HI>Oracle: Hum</HI> &s;ays the
Lord that &s;poke the Introduction, and
added, &startq;that it was his Opinion, that
the Sum of all they had left for it,
was contained in what that Lord
had &s;aid: He told them that there
had very &s;eldom been a Mini&s;try in
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, but had acted &s;o
unwarily, whether by the Error of
their Employments, that they might
ea&s;ily be fallen upon by them that
came next. He told them there was
an eminent Lord of the la&s;t Age,
who u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if any Noble|man
was willing to be of the con|trary
Party, there was always Room
to come in and find Fault with
the Mini&s;try; and that he would un|dertake
to impeach, if he thought
<PB N="59" REF="62">
fit, all the Secretaries of State, Trea|&s;urers,
and Pre&s;idents of the Coun|cil,
that had been &s;ince the Re&s;tora|tion;
that as this was their
pre&s;ent Work, they had nothing to
do, but to concert Mea&s;ures to fall up|on
the Mini&s;try, that bringing
them into Di&s;grace, they might, as
had been the known Practice of
former Times, fill their Places up
with &s;uch Men as they had re&s;erv'd
in Petto, to &s;peak of in their Turn.&endq;</P>
<P>Here a certain Lord &s;tood up, who
had not &s;poken yet, for who&s;e De&s;cri|ption
this may &s;uffice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he
is a general Exception to that Maxim
in Phy&s;iognomy, <HI>that to go with the
Mouth open is the certain Sign of a
Fool:</HI> He took them up &s;hort, and
&startq;told them, he wondred to &s;ee them
fall &s;o earne&s;tly upon the la&s;t Head
of the Propo&s;itions fir&s;t; he added,
that he thought it was a little omi|nous,
that they &s;hould begin at the
wrong End of their Work, and &s;et
their Scheme with the Bottom up|ward:
That he hoped they would not
go on at that Rate all the Way: He
&s;aid, he ob&s;erved that the fir&s;t thing
<PB N="60" REF="63">
mentioned in the Propo&s;itions, was
what indeed was fir&s;t in the Nature
of the Thing, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to try to form
them&s;elves into a Body as a Party; to
encrea&s;e their Numbers, and make
them&s;elves formidable, by getting
over as many to their Party as they
could; and he wondered, he &s;aid,
they &s;hould not take hold of every
Man that Fate threw in their Way,
for Advantages given were always
to be taken; that it was an old
Maxim in <HI>Machiavell,</HI> that <HI>falling
Favourites are the Beginners of Fa|ction.</HI>
That in Order to overthrow
the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, their only
Way was, to make them&s;elves pow|erful
by Numbers; he concluded
thus, and <HI>is there not a Man ju&s;t
now fallen from the highe&s;t Pinnacle
of Favour! Can you think,</HI> my
Lords, <HI>he has no Re&s;entment, or
that he believes he had no Merit?</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ORACLE took up this Di&s;cour&s;e
immediately, and replyed, that his
Lord&s;hip aim'd right, and his Re|proof
had been ju&s;t, if he had it
not to a&s;&s;ure him, that Care was
taken to tamper with every Man,
<PB N="61" REF="64">
that gave the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to think
he was in the lea&s;t &s;ower'd or Cha|grin
in his Pro&s;pects; and that they
had &s;napt them all up as fa&s;t as
they dropt, except 2 or 3, who
they found undocible, and not
capable of receiving due Impre&s;&s;ions:
That particularly, for the great
Man he mentioned, he had not
failed fir&s;t by proper In&s;truments,
and at la&s;t by him&s;elf, to attack him
with all po&s;&s;ible Skill; but found
him either in &s;uch Hopes of retrieving
his Fortunes, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould of|fer,
or &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of his Mortifica|tions,
that he appear'd inflexible to
all that could be offer'd; and <HI>when I
found nothing el&s;e would work,</HI> &s;aid
Oracle, <HI>I attacked him with this im|portunate
Que&s;tion:</HI> My Lord, <HI>I
hope</HI> your Grace <HI>will be a Friend
to THE CH&V;RCH;</HI> He turn'd up|on
his Heel, and with an Air of
Contempt an&s;wered me, <HI>Always,</HI> my
Lord, <HI>when the Church is &s;o to her
&s;elf:</HI> and giving me no Time to
reply, walked away; <HI>&s;o I pre&s;ently
gave him up for a lo&s;t Man on both
Sides,</HI> (viz.) one that could &s;tand
<PB N="62" REF="65">
&s;till and &s;ee him&s;elf ..... u&s;ed, and
had no Sen&s;e of entring into Mea|&s;ures
to re&s;tore him&s;elf, at the Ex|pence
of tho&s;e that turn'd him out,
and one that had not Affection
enough for the Church to take
Share with us in her Intere&s;ts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He went on to tell them, that
finding that great Man, tho' di&s;|placed
in Publick, yet hankering
about the Court, and frequently
paying his Compliment to a certain
Prince, at lea&s;t in publick; it brought
to his Memory the Story of an
<HI>Engli&s;h&punc;</HI> Prince, who entertained his
Favourite <HI>Gave&s;ton,</HI> contrary to his
Father's Injunctions: and this put a
Thought in his Head, which, he &s;aid,
he acknowledged had &s;ome ill Na|ture,
if not &s;ome Trea&s;on in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
whether the &s;aid Prince, in Grati|fication
of his own Inclinations,
might not be brought to do &s;ome
di&s;obliging Thing in the Ca&s;e of
his Favourite, and that &s;o &s;ome
Mi&s;under&s;tanding might be pro|duced
between the two Chief
Heads of the Government:
But he acknowledged, that upon
<PB N="63" REF="66">
Reflection, he not only found that
the Prince was too wi&s;e, and better
advi&s;ed, than to do any Thing
which looked that Way; but, on the
contrary, acted with &s;uch Prudence,
&s;uch Caution, &s;uch Deference to his
Father's Mea&s;ures, and &s;uch Dete&s;ta|tion
of every Thing that looked
undutiful or unkind, that there was
no Room to hope for it; and on the
other Hand, the Thought looked
&s;o horrid, &s;o unchri&s;tian, and in
its own Nature &s;o trea&s;onable, that
he (<HI>Oracle</HI>) &s;aid he could not bear
to reflect on it him&s;elf; and therefore
he told them he hoped they would
find better Mea&s;ures than any of
the&s;e to think on, and which he
made no Que&s;tion would offer to
them in the &s;erious Enquiry they
were upon.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Nigroq.</HI> &s;miled at this Di&s;cour&s;e;
for though he politically acquie&s;ced in
the general Dete&s;tation of the Thing
it &s;elf, yet he &s;eemed to intimate as
if he would have made no Scruple to
&s;ow Divi&s;ions and Di&s;&s;atisfactions of
the wor&s;t kind, even in the Royal
Family it &s;elf, if it had been po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
and if it might have an&s;wered the
End another Way; but &s;eeing it was
not likely to &s;ucceed, all that knew
<HI>Nigroq.</HI> will acknowledge it was not
likely he &s;hould not condemn it.</P>
<P><HI>It came before them to con&s;ider of
the &s;econd Head,</HI> (viz.) To cultivate
the Di&s;&s;atisfactions of the People in the
Country, and to con&s;ider how to make
the Apprehen&s;ions of the Danger of the
Church more popular.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus</HI> &s;hook his Head at that
Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the Danger of the Church!</HI>
&startq;He told them he wi&s;ht they
would con&s;ider of &s;ome more pro|per
Engine than this, for that this
had been canva&s;&s;ed up and down,
and dwelt upon till it grew &s;tale,
and had not that Effect upon the
People as it would have, if it was
let &s;leep in the Grave of Forget|fulne&s;s
for a few Years; then he
&s;aid it might have a Re&s;urrection,
and come in Play again; but that
now he really thought it was worn
quite out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>He told them further,</HI> that the
Clergy them&s;elves began to be &s;ur|feited
with it; the People, were
<PB N="65" REF="68">
&s;ick of it, and it would not go any
farther in mo&s;t Places of the Coun|try;
but that which was very par|ticular
he told them, Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> and &s;ome of the Ja|cobite
Clergy, had now entred in|to
a Debate, even with the <HI>High-Church</HI>
it &s;elf; charging them all
with <HI>Here&s;ie</HI> and <HI>Schi&s;m;</HI> affirming
that the true Church of <HI>England</HI> re|mained
only with the <HI>Nonjurors:</HI>
This, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> had &s;o alarmed, and
di&s;obliged the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI>
unchurching them all at one Blow;
that they were all entring upon a
new Strife about it one with ano|ther,
and that here only the apparent
<HI>Danger to the Church</HI> was to be &s;een.&endq;</P>
<P>HERE he gave him&s;elf a loo&s;e, to
exclaim again&s;t the Nonjurors, charg|ing
them with Ingratitude to tho&s;e,
who had done &s;o many obliging
Things for them; alledging that even
this Notion of the Danger of the
Church, was it &s;elf begun and car|ried
on, to &s;erve them, and had
done them Service, though there
might be &s;ome other Ends in the
pu&s;hing it on: But for them to turn
<PB N="66" REF="69">
the Tables upon the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and at once to di&s;own her,
and reproach all her Clergy as Schi&s;|maticks;
was not only unkind, but
fooli&s;h; and opened the Mouths of
the Whigs, to lay the Danger of the
Church at their Door, and that in a
manner which could not be deny|ed;
all the&s;e Things, he &s;aid, urged
them to lay a&s;ide the Notion of the
Danger of the Church at this Time;
and therefore he was for con&s;idering
of &s;ome Equivalent.</P>
<P>My Lord&mdash;&s;econded this
Motion, and told them he was of the
&s;ame Mind, as to the Danger of the
Church; be&s;ides, he &s;aid the People, as
he thought, began on both Sides to have
no great Concern for the Thing,
or &s;o much as to enquire, whether
the Church was in Danger or no: But
the Difficulty was, what popular
thing to trump up in the Room of
it.</P>
<P><HI>Nigroq.</HI> told them, he wondered any
one &s;hould think to break an old
Proverb, that 'twas always ea&s;y to
find a Stone to throw at a Dog; that
he never expected to find this Nation
<PB N="67" REF="70">
in &s;o happy a Condition, that there
&s;hould be nothing to find Fanlt with;
that as long as Kings admini&s;tred their
Affairs by Servants and State&s;men;
the People would never want Oppre&s;|&s;ions
to cry out of, and Grievances
to complain of.</P>
<P>The Lord who came with <HI>Monoculus</HI>
put in here, and &s;aid, &startq;he under|&s;tood
ea&s;ily what they all meant,
but wondred to &s;ee they were all
&s;o &s;hy of &s;peaking plain <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI>
He hoped, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> they had no
Apprehen&s;ions or Di&s;tru&s;t about
them of any one that was there; if
they had, they were all in the
wrong to have &s;aid &s;o much, and
him&s;elf in particular: And if they
had not, the Want of Freedom and
Plainne&s;s would be the Ruin of all
their De&s;igns; That for his Part,
he had begun to &s;peak plainly, and
would go on &s;o: <HI>that it was true,</HI>
the Notion of the Danger of the
Church, was grown a <HI>by Word;</HI>
That the Whigs began to upbraid them
with it, and tell them that &s;uch and
&s;uch Things were done, &s;o many Years
were lap&s;ed, &s;o many Whig Se&s;&s;ions
of Parliament over, &s;o many Troops
<PB N="68" REF="71">
rai&s;ed, &s;o many Months the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> Bill &s;u&s;pended, &s;o long King
<HI>George</HI> had reign'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet the
Church &s;tood where it did &s;till; He
told them however, that they were not
to give that Point up, for that it was
really fact that the Church was in
Danger, and he did not doubt, but
it would appear at &s;ome Time or
other. &startq;<HI>But now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>we mu&s;t
turn our Di&s;cour&s;e to other Things:</HI>
Then he de&s;cended to Particulars,
and concluded that, in a Word, <HI>they
mu&s;t form a Party at Court:</HI> He
added, that the Mini&s;try are to be
blacken'd and expo&s;ed; we cannot
doubt, &s;aid he, but that they
will give us Room enough to lay
hold of them by, <HI>I do not know,</HI>
&s;aid he, <HI>whether it be in their Power
to prevent it, or whether they, or any
Mini&s;try, ever managed without giving
&s;ufficient Ground to expo&s;e and depo&s;e
them.</HI> This then mu&s;t be our Bu|&s;ine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,
<HI>&s;aid Monoculus,</HI> but then
you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Ground for
this; you cannot fall upon them
without &s;ome Pretence; and I a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="69" REF="72">
you, the Mini&s;try are Men that
will not ea&s;ily be &s;nared.&endq;</P>
<P>That mu&s;t be left to Time, &s;aid
the other Lord; but in the mean
Time, &s;ays he, if I under&s;tand our
Pre&s;ent Work right, it was to be
one Part of our Work now, to con&s;i|der
of WHO, and WHO, &s;hould be
appointed to &s;ucceed the pre&s;ent Mini|&s;try:
He added, that he would recom|mend
it to them, to think of Per&s;ons
that were acceptable to the King, ca|pable
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not too unpo|pular,
and that none &s;hould be na|med,
e&s;pecially at fir&s;t, who were in
the lea&s;t obnoxious to the hotte&s;t Part
of the Whigs; that had ever been
Favourers of the Pretender, or Abet|tors,
or &s;o much as Countenancers of
the late Di&s;turbances; we may alter
them afterwards, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> as we &s;ee
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I like all that well, <HI>&s;ays Oracle,</HI>
whatever we mean; and he added,
that he did not doubt, but that &s;ome
Gentlemen there, were come pro|vided
with Li&s;ts of &s;uch Names as they
thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73">
Upon this, &s;everal pulled out
Papers, in which divers Names were
put in; but as they differed very
much in their Li&s;ts, and that &s;ome Men
were put in, which, it is very probable,
had never been con&s;ulted in the Ca&s;e;
and above all, becau&s;e the Relator
hereof cannot charge his Memory
with the Particulars of &s;o many
Names, the &s;aid Li&s;ts are omitted.</P>
<P>It is true, there being &s;ome longer
Debates upon one Li&s;t, and &s;ome
Names in it for the particular Offices of
Secretary of State, and the Trea&s;ury,
it was ea&s;ier to recollect; and the
Author remembers, that my Lord
<HI>Cb</HI>&mdash;was named there, with
Mr. <HI>Br</HI>&mdash;as Secretaries of State:
and Mr. <HI>Bri</HI>&mdash;for fir&s;t Com|mi&s;&s;ioner
of the Trea&s;ury; the&s;e
were &s;aid to be named as unque&s;ti|onable
Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as between
all Parties, would give the lea&s;t Um|brage
of Di&s;content.</P>
<P>Not but that in reading over the
&s;everal Li&s;ts, the Author &s;ays, there
was not a Place of Profit or Tru&s;t,
or a Po&s;t of Honour in the Court,
Army or Navy, but new Men were
<PB N="71" REF="74">
named to them, and the Relator on|ly
wondered, they had not named a
new Man for the fir&s;t Po&s;t of all,
and brought out a new King too;
becau&s;e then the Turn would have
been univer&s;al and effectual, as one
of them expre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e upon the&s;e Li&s;ts
was very long, and &s;carce a Man was
named, who&s;e Character did not ad|mit
of &s;uch Exceptions, as after a
little Di&s;cour&s;e, obliged them to lay
him a&s;ide; &s;o that at la&s;t, they had
fixed on but very few, the Princi|pal
of whom are as above.</P>
<P>The Debates now began to draw
to a Clo&s;e, and e&s;pecially after what
a certain Lord Duke moved, upon the
Subject of entring, or not entring
immediately upon the&s;e Mea&s;ures;
fir&s;t he asked them, if they had no|thing
to charge upon the Court-Managers
ju&s;t now to begin with, that
they might attack them upon the
Spot; that they might have &s;ome
Time to expo&s;e them to the People
fir&s;t; and then at the King's Arrival,
they might repre&s;ent the Mini&s;try as
hateful to the Nation, and under
<PB N="72" REF="75">
who&s;e Conduct, the People were
made unea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>Monoculus,</HI> a Friend to doing nothing,
told them, that Lord had moved
well, but there were two unhappy
Circum&s;tances which rendered it
difficult to offer at that Matter at
this Time: <HI>One was,</HI> the Advance
of the publick Credit, which ju&s;t
then was run up to &s;uch a Height,
whether by the Nature of Things,
or by the Arts of the Managers, he
could not determine; as that the like
had not been known for many Years;
and they knew, he &s;aid, that the
ri&s;ing or falling of publick Credit
was always given as a Te&s;t of the
Ea&s;ine&s;s or Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Peo|ple
under the Admini&s;tration; and
therefore had ordinarily been made
u&s;e of, for, or again&s;t the Mini&s;try,
in all Reigns, as an Argument of
their good or ill Management. (2.)
<HI>The other was,</HI> the &s;etting on foot a
Treaty of Alliance with <HI>France,</HI>
which if it &s;ucceeded, would at this
Time give the Mini&s;try but too great
a Reputation for managing Things
abroad, and for their Penetration in
<PB N="73" REF="76">
the Affairs of Foreign Countries; That
tho' nothing was more true, than that
all that Part was owing to the Di|rection
of the King him&s;elf, and
might have been done, and indeed
would have been done, though
the Mini&s;try had been Ideots; yet
however, it was likewi&s;e very cer|tain,
that as when Things go ill,
the Mini&s;try have the Blame among
the People, whether they merit an
ill Word or no: &s;o on the con|trary,
when Succe&s;s an&s;wers Abroad
or at Home, it redounds to the
Honour and Advantage of the
Mini&s;try, though perhaps they had
no Hand at all in the conducting of
them.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, &s;ays
<HI>Oracle,</HI> your Grace does not think
it a proper Time to fall upon the
Mini&s;try NOW; I a&s;&s;ure you, I am of a
contrary Opinion.</P>
<P>A grave Per&s;on of Honour, who&s;e
Years added more to the Weight of
what he &s;aid, than his Judgment, told the
Meeting, he was of Opinion, they were
in the Right to re&s;olve to attack
the Mini&s;try as &s;oon as they had a
<PB N="74" REF="77">
fair Charge again&s;t them, but hoped
for their own Sakes they would take
Care not to begin till they were
&s;ure the Blow could not be warded
off; and therefore moved that they
&s;hould con&s;ider very well upon that
Part before they began.</P>
<P>Another moved, that a Meeting
&s;hould be appointed to draw Heads
of Articles, it having been &s;ugge&s;t|ed
that &s;ome in the Company were
backward to offer particulars, but in
a more private Manner, and that
therefore a &s;ecret Committee &s;hould
be appointed.</P>
<P><HI>Quinquhan</HI> had hitherto &s;ilently
li&s;&s;ened to all the grave Speeches of
the A&s;&s;embly, and if he had &s;aid any
Thing, it was only in whi&s;per to &s;uch
as &s;at next him, but had taken Notes
of all that had been &s;aid; and find|ing
every Man had given his Opi|nion,
at lea&s;t every one that in|tended
it: He took up his Notes,
and looking upon them, as if he
was going to &s;um up the Cau&s;e,
and to read &s;omething out of his
Paper, he began with recapitulating
the End and De&s;ign of that Meeting,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
which was, as he call'd it, to ob&s;erve
at what Gap they might break in
upon the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration; He
told them, it was evident Force was
not their Work, our ra&s;h Friends,
&s;ays he, have done us Harm in that
Part; but thank Heaven we have
no other Share in their Misfortunes;
and with that he &s;miled a litle.</P>
<P>He told them, he found &s;ome had
been in Hopes to keep up the Fer|ment
of the People by Mobbs and
Rabbles, but he thought that Way
would never do; becau&s;e the Govern|ment
would always fall upon the
People with Force; and though at
fir&s;t, the Gallows and the La&s;h
would but exa&s;perate, yet there be|ing
no Help at Hand, the People
would cool and be di&s;couraged: So
that upon the whole, &s;ays he, <HI>I do
not &s;ee that the Mini&s;try can be brok|en
in upon that Way.</HI> As for the Dan|ger
of the Church, he told them,
$e found they were all of the Opi|nion
that it was a thread-bare Com|plaint,
had been made u&s;e of as
long as there was any tolerable
<PB N="76" REF="79">
Room for it, and that being now
worn out, it &s;hould &s;leep a while,
and keep cold, and he added, that
he was of the &s;ame Mind.</P>
<P>As to the other Mea&s;ures, he
&s;aid, he found all that they pro|po&s;ed
might come to this: That they
&s;hould &s;et up what was formerly
called the Country Party, again&s;t the
Court; which indeed had formerly
been practi&s;ed with Succe&s;s, but that
Things were at pre&s;ent in &s;uch a
Po&s;ture, by the Steddine&s;s of the
Prince, and the Vigilance of the
Mini&s;try, that he did not &s;ee Room
for any Thing to be done that
Way, and that therefore he could
give them no Encouragement.</P>
<P><HI>Nil de&s;perandum,</HI> &s;aid ORACLE,
wi&s;e Men never de&s;pair of any
Thing. Adding, that though he
was not &s;o much in Ha&s;t to preci|pitate
Things before their Time; yet
he was not &s;o flegmatick as his
Grace was, who &s;poke la&s;t; the
Church, he &s;aid, had a &s;trong Par|ty
&s;till, and always would have &s;o;
and as their Intere&s;t was already
good, though &s;omething di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="77" REF="80">
by the late Di&s;orders, yet he did
not doubt but $word$ Time to retrieve
Things, and &s;o propo&s;ed three Parti|culars
to them.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That &s;eeing Things did
not appear &s;o ea&s;y and
practicable now, as it was
hoped they might do in
a little longer Time, they
&s;hould therefore defer their
Proceeding to another Op|portunity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That neverthele&s;s they
&s;hould not fail to corre|&s;pond
with their Friends
in all Parts, to cultivate
their Intere&s;ts, and increa&s;e
their Party.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That in the mean Time,
they &s;hould offer the pre|&s;ent
Mini&s;try all the Af|fronts,
Di&s;trubances, and
Unea&s;ine&s;s they could, &s;o
as not to bring them&s;elves
within the Reach of their
Power.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">
They had &s;everal other petty Re|&s;olves;
&s;uch as that they would up|on
all Occa&s;ions encourage R$bbits,
Tumults, Libels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> again&s;t the
Government, but e&s;pecially again&s;t
the Mini&s;ters of State: That every
Thing as might &s;erve to keep up the
Spirit of Di&s;content among the Peo|ple,
&s;hould be diligently watched for, and
propagated: That the &s;eptennial Bill
may be of as little U&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and
the Whigs may be as certain to lo&s;e
their Aim at the next Election as
they did before.</P>
<P>There were no Debates upon any
of the&s;e Heads, but the fir&s;t; &s;ome en|deavoured
to keep up their Spirits a
while, but after &s;ome few Di&s;cour&s;es,
it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olv'd in the
Affirmative, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that as things now
&s;tood, there was nothing could be
done, and that therefore it was pro|per
to wait a fairer Opportunity; and
&s;o the A&s;&s;embly broke up.</P>
