<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Affairs of</HI> Greece <HI>have lain
under &s;uch a general Su&s;picion, that
I think I ought not to publi&s;h any
Account of them, without premi&s;ing &s;ome|thing
concerning the Truth in Hi&s;tory. It
is this</HI> Plato <HI>calls the</HI> Property <HI>of it, and</HI>
Cicero <HI>its</HI> chief Law, <HI>and</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hing
Character: <HI>And it was in regard to this,
that I was deterr'd at my fir&s;t Entrance up|on
the</HI> Grecian <HI>Story, e&s;pecially when I
found the Ancients them&s;elves &s;o confoun|ded,
that few of them dated it from the
&s;ame Period. Some affirm there was no
Hi&s;tory of</HI> Greece <HI>before</HI> Phoroneus <HI>the Son
of</HI> Inachus: <HI>And others fix the</HI> Attick Aera
<HI>at the</HI> Flood <HI>of</HI> Ogyges, <HI>which happen'd a|bout
the &s;ame time.</HI> Plutarch <HI>makes an
Excu&s;e for beginning &s;o high as</HI> The&s;eus:
Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus <HI>&s;ays there was no|thing
certain before the</HI> Trojan <HI>War; and</HI>
Ephorus <HI>the</HI> Cnmaean, Calli&s;thenes, <HI>and</HI>
Theopompus <HI>dated their Hi&s;tories eighty
Years lower, from the</HI> Return <HI>of the</HI> Hera|clidae.
<PB REF="10">
Varro <HI>calls the Beginning of the</HI>
Olympiads <HI>the</HI> Hi&s;torical Times: Pliny
<HI>gives little Credit to all that is writ of</HI>
Greece <HI>before the Reign of</HI> Cyrus, <HI>which
began in the fifty fifth</HI> Olympiad; <HI>and
others place the mo&s;t ancient Hi&s;torians but
a little before the</HI> De&s;cent <HI>of the</HI> Per&s;ian.</P>
<P><HI>It is not to be imagin'd, that the</HI> Grecians
<HI>had for &s;o long a Tract of Time receiv'd no
Foot&s;teps of the former Ages; the Di&s;pute
is, at what time they came to be &s;o plain,
that they might trace them with Ea&s;e, and
tread in them with Safety. If we enquire
a little into the Origine of Hi&s;tory, we &s;hall
find the innate De&s;ire of Glory put Men up|on
finding out ways to Tran&s;mit their Names
to Po&s;terity even before the Invention of
Letters. They left their Images as an In|heritance
to their Sons; their mo&s;t remark|able
Atchievements were &s;ign'd by</HI> Hierogly|phicks,
<HI>or painted and engrav'd on their
Walls; and their Songs, tho' very rude and
ill-modell'd, pre&s;erv'd the Memory of their
great Captains, and were fre&s;h Incentives to
their Po&s;terity. When Writing was in U&s;e,
they erected Stones with In&s;criptions on
them: And</HI> Eu&s;ebius <HI>&s;ays, that</HI> Hermes
Tri&s;megi&s;tus <HI>wrote his Doctrine on Pillars,
lea&s;t upon the Inundation of the</HI> Nile <HI>it
&s;hould be lo&s;t. It mu&s;t be own'd it was very
late before Letters were receiv'd in</HI> Greece;
<PB REF="11">
<HI>and even after that, there was not the &s;ame
Care taken, as in other Nations, to apply
the U&s;e of them to Hi&s;tory. The</HI> Aegypti|ans,
<HI>who pretended to the greate&s;t Improve|ments,
as well in this, as in other Parts of
Learning, committed the Care of their pub|lick</HI>
Memoirs <HI>to their Colleges of Prie&s;ts:
Yet as an In&s;tance of the general Defect in
the Hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t Ages, they could not
even in</HI> Herodotus'<HI>s time give any certain
Account of the building their</HI> Pyramids, <HI>nor
of their great Monarch Se&s;o&s;tris. The</HI> Per|&s;ian
<HI>Hi&s;torians were the</HI> Magi, <HI>the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
among them both for Knowledge
and Station: And in</HI> Rome <HI>the</HI> Pontiffs <HI>had
the Charge of making their</HI> Annals. <HI>So that
the</HI> Grecians <HI>were the only People of Note,
who were carele&s;s in this re&s;pect, and for
many Ages follow'd only their fir&s;t Guide,</HI>
Tradition. <HI>It was this made them attri|bute
&s;uch immoderate things to Antiquity,
that where any Man excell'd in Virtue or
Power, he was in Proce&s;s of Time elevated
into a Deity; the Di&s;tance of Time magni|fying
things almo&s;t in the &s;ame Proportion,
as the Di&s;tance of Place le&s;&s;ens them. And
whatever the&s;e Traditional Stories were,
they were &s;till aggravated by the Poets, who
were undoubtedly their fir&s;t Hi&s;torians.
Hence it was, that their Hi&s;tory became &s;o
vitiated by &s;o many Different and Mon|&s;trous
<PB REF="12">
Relations of their Gods and Heroes;
and this is the chief Foundation of all the
Fables of Antiquity. <HI>Lactantius</HI> ob&s;erves
that the Poets writ the Truth, tho' they
di&s;guis'd it; but the Veil was &s;o thick that
it could never be perfectly thrown off: And
therefore the dark and confu&s;ed Accounts
we have of the fir&s;t Ages, &s;eem like In&s;crip|tions
upon ancient Medals half defaced,
where the defective Part is to be &s;upply'd
by Gue&s;s from the remaining Characters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But notwithstanding the Spirit of</HI> Ro|mance,
<HI>which runs through the</HI> Grecian <HI>Sto|ry,
one may venture to &s;ay of the fir&s;t</HI> Gre|cians,
<HI>what</HI> Mon&s;ieur de St. Evremond <HI>does
of the</HI> Romans, <HI>that</HI> They had &s;o many real
Excellencies to be admir'd for, that there
was no need of having Recour&s;e to Fables.
<HI>I make no que&s;tion, but there were &s;uch Men
as</HI> Hercules, The&s;eus, <HI>and many others,
who&s;e Stories are handed down to us; that
they did many of the Acts, which are ascri|bed
to them: And one Rea&s;on why Men
doubt of their Atchievements, may be, be|cau&s;e
they would not imitate them. For it
is a Natural Ob&s;ervation of</HI> Salu&s;t, <HI>that
we are too apt to take our Dimen&s;ions of o|thers
from our own Standard, and conceive
every thing feign'd, which exceeds our own
Power. But what I &s;ay of the&s;e fir&s;t He|roes,
I would have under&s;tood only of the
<PB REF="13">
mode&s;t Part of their Characters; for &s;ome
things a&s;crib'd to them, are too gro&s;s to
bear any Colour of Probability. What I
have endeavour'd in this &s;hort Survey, has
been to purge them, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from
the fabulous A&s;per&s;ions of the Poets, who
by advancing them &s;o far above the Stan|dard
of Humanity, have brought their real
Merit in que&s;tion, and eclips'd tho&s;e Virtues
they intended to adorn. If they &s;till &s;eem
to act too much above the Condition of Men,
I may be allow'd to appeal in their behalf
to a later Race of Heroes: And indeed it is
not the lea&s;t part of their Vindication, that
we &s;ee the Wonders of pa&s;t Ages &s;o gloriou&s;ly
atte&s;ted by tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent. I dare
not from hence take Occa&s;ion to enter into a
thorough Defence of Antiquity: I know it
would require a much abler Advocate; and
I am &s;en&s;ible how far it has already &s;uffer'd
in my following Account of it. I can only
pretend to have been cautious in affirming
any thing, where I doubted my Authority:
And tho' among the &s;everal Opinions of
Authors I have mark'd out what &s;eem'd to
me the mo&s;t probable, yet there is &s;till Room
left for the Reader to pa&s;s his own Judg|ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Here it may not be improper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing
of the chief Authors, from whom this
Hi&s;tory is collected, in order to &s;how how
<PB REF="14">
far we may depend upon its Credibility. The
fir&s;t from whom we receive any tolerable
Light into the</HI> Grecian <HI>Affairs, is</HI> Herodo|tus,
<HI>who is &s;tiled the</HI> Father of Hi&s;tory, <HI>ei|ther
becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t who reduc'd it
into any thing of Form, or at least the fir&s;t
whose Writings in that kind have been pre|&s;erv'd.
His Stile is &s;o ea&s;ie, &s;mooth, and
elegant, and his Matter &s;o entertaining,
that for this Rea&s;on his Books bear the
Names of the</HI> Nine Mu&s;es. <HI>His chief Care
was to plea&s;e rather than in&s;truct; and
therefore in&s;tead of the Wars between the</HI>
Grecians <HI>and</HI> Barbarians, <HI>which he promi&s;es
to treat of, he entertains you with a Colle|ction
of Antiquities, which he delivers upon
the Credit of the</HI> Aegyptian <HI>Prie&s;ts, and
gives you a Narrative of all he knows. So
that half his Book is Digre&s;&s;ion and</HI> Paren|the&s;is:
<HI>And in this Liberty he has been too
faithfully imitated by his Succe&s;&s;ors, many
of who&s;e Works are &s;uch perfect Grote&s;ques,
that in peru&s;ing them you often lo&s;e the
principal De&s;ign. The heavie&s;t Charge a|gain&s;t
him is his Fabulou&s;ne&s;s, and Credu|lity.
But they &s;eem not to be acquainted
with his De&s;ign, who blame him for want
of Truth: He was &s;o far from being a &s;evere
Hi&s;torian, that he endeavour'd only, as
the former Poets, to confine him&s;elf within
the Rules of Probability. Poetry was then
<PB REF="15">
at the Heighth, the</HI> Drama <HI>was carry'd
high by</HI> Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, <HI>and</HI> Euripi|des,
<HI>the</HI> Dithyrambic <HI>by</HI> Pindar, <HI>and the</HI>
Heroick <HI>by</HI> Homer: Herodotus <HI>&s;ought out a
new Glory, and diverted the Grecians with
Pro&s;e, or rather, as</HI> Quintilian <HI>&s;ays, with
more &s;ecret Numbers.</HI></P>
<P>Thucydides <HI>&s;oon gave another Turn to
Hi&s;tory, and at once reform'd, and perfect|ed
it. He declares he was apprehen&s;ive his
Hi&s;tory would not plea&s;e the pre&s;ent Age
for want of Fables: But yet he cho&s;e rather
to &s;atisfie the Judgment of Po&s;terity, and
by that means gain'd to his Work the Title
he de&s;ir'd of an</HI> Everla&s;ting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>His
Stile is grave, ma&s;culine, and noble, his
Expre&s;&s;ion clo&s;e and &s;ententious, his Rea|&s;oning
&s;trong and profound, always ju&s;t and
to the Purpo&s;e. He has many other Beau|ties
which are fully and hand&s;omly de&s;crib'd
by</HI> Mon&s;ieur Rapin, <HI>and others, who have
consider'd him as the compleate&s;t Model of
the</HI> Grecian <HI>Hi&s;tory. But I mu&s;t not di&s;|mi&s;s
his Character, without taking Notice
of that which occa&s;ion'd my mentioning him,
his Virtue and Sincerity. He adher'd &s;o
con&s;tantly and ob&s;tinately to the Truth, that
if he had not told you he was an</HI> Athenian,
<HI>you could never di&s;cover it by his writing;
much le&s;s would you imagine, that he was
engag'd in many of the Expeditions he de|&s;cribes,
<PB REF="16">
&s;ince he indu&s;triously omits all th$
faire&s;t Opportunities of extolling him&s;elf
and his Country, for fear it &s;hould look like
Pa&s;&s;ion and Di&s;gui&s;e. If any thing gives
a turn of Romance to his Hi&s;tory, it is his
&s;et Speeches, which perhaps may appear too
regular to be deliver'd in the Heat of Acti|on,
or upon any &s;udden Emergencies. But
they are &s;o admirably &s;uited to the Occa&s;ion,
and have &s;uch an agreeable it Mixture of O|ratory,
and good Sen&s;e, that we may ea&s;ily
pardon that as a Blemi&s;h in him, which in
others would have been look'd upon as their
greate&s;t Beauty. There &s;hines throughout
the other Parts of his Work &s;uch an Air of
Ju&s;tice, Candor, and Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that
perhaps no Heathen Writer ever equall'd him:
And the only thing to be wi&s;h'd for more
than what he has perform'd, is, that he
had taken in a larger Compa&s;s of Time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His Lo&s;s was in a great mea&s;ure repair'd
by</HI> Xenophon, <HI>who continu'd his hi&s;tory in
&s;o pure and ea&s;ie, &s;o &s;weet and unaffected a
Stile, that from thence he obtain'd the Name
of the</HI> Attick Bee. <HI>The Admirers of the</HI>
Sublime <HI>charge him with being too much
upon the Level: But it was his great Ar|tifice
to &s;peak properly, and yet not</HI> vulgar|ly;
<HI>wherein he re&s;embles a clear and gentle
Stream, which can hardly be perceiv'd to
flow, and yet never &s;tagnates. He was a
<PB REF="17">
perfect Ma&s;ter of Nature, and under&s;tood
the &s;ecret Graces of Simplicity; which as
it &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly upon his Readers, &s;o it
made his Narrative appear more &s;incere and
impartial. In &s;hort, he was the only</HI> Gre|cian,
<HI>who knew how to &s;upport the Digni|ty
of Hi&s;tory with the Plainne&s;s of Expre&s;|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus <HI>is to be valu'd for his
laborious Collections; and tho' he takes in
too many of the Fables of his Predece&s;&s;ors,
and adheres too much to the Traditions of
the Aegyptian Prie&s;ts, he &s;erves very well
to &s;upply, and compare with others.</HI> Mon|&s;ieur
de la Mothe le Vayer <HI>had &s;uch an O|pinion
of him, that he declares,</HI> He would
freely travel to the End of the World, if he
were &s;ure of finding that Part of him which
is lo&s;t, and envies Po&s;terity the bare Proba|bility
of recovering &s;o great a Trea&s;ure.
Plutarch <HI>has al&s;o pre&s;ented us with many
rich and uncommon Gleanings from the An|cients;
he has drawn his Heroes in their
full Proportion, and in their Lives com|pris'd
the Hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t remarkable Oc|currences.
He is generally cautious and im|partial;
but as he was a great Collector, he
is not always con&s;i&s;tent and of a Piece, ei|ther
as to Matter, or Stile. Be&s;ides one may
too ea&s;ily di&s;cover the old Man in him; he
loves a Story, tho' never &s;o foreign to his
<PB REF="18">
Subject; he tells it with too many Circum|&s;tances,
and with too great an Air of Su|per&s;tition.
I have always thought he would
make an excellent Abridgment: For where
he &s;peaks to the purpo&s;e, few &s;peak better;
and he has &s;carce been equall'd in the ju&s;t|ne&s;s
of his Characters, and the Wi&s;dom of
his Reflections. It is not the lea&s;t part of
his Merit, that he has pre&s;erv'd &s;o many</HI>
Sayings <HI>of the greate&s;t Men; and I have
been cautious of omitting any that were ma|terial,
becau&s;e, as he &s;ays him&s;elf,</HI> A Je&s;t,
or an Apothegm often &s;hews a Man more
than a Battel. <HI>The</HI> Lives <HI>of</HI> Nepos <HI>de&s;erve
Mention in this Catalogue: But they &s;eem
to be only Characters drawn from his gene|ral
Hi&s;tory, and are too short to give us a|ny
thorough Image of Antiquity. And in
this re&s;pect</HI> Ju&s;tin's <HI>Abridgement of</HI> Trogus
Pompeius <HI>&s;erves chiefly to make us regret
the Lo&s;s of the Original.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the&s;e Authors I have added the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of our Countrymen, Sir</HI> Wal$er Raleigh,
<HI>Dr.</HI> Howel, <HI>and the learned Sir</HI> John Mar|&s;ham,
<HI>who in his</HI> Canon Chronicus <HI>has ta|ken
a great deal of Pains to reconcile the
different Aera's of the fir&s;t Ages. And a|mong
the Moderns, I am particularly oblig'd to</HI>
Mon&s;ieur Tourreil, <HI>who in his Preface
before &s;ome of Demo&s;thenes's Orations, has
laid out an admirable Plan of</HI> Greece;
<PB REF="19">
<HI>wherein, as far as the Compa&s;s of his De|&s;ign
would permit, he has di&s;tingui&s;h'd the
mo&s;t remarkable Periods, di&s;cover'd the</HI> Ge|nius,
<HI>and unravell'd the Intere&s;ts of the &s;e|veral
States, and trac'd out the Steps, by
which they arriv'd to their Turns of Supe|riority.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having mention'd the chief Materials, of
which this Hi&s;tory is compos'd, it may be
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew in what manner I have
dige&s;ted them. As to the Method I have
made u&s;e of, I could not meet with any more
clear and ea&s;ie, than that laid down in the</HI>
Engli&s;h Collection <HI>of the</HI> Roman Hi&s;tory;
<HI>which I have therefore follow'd in my Di|vi&s;ion
of</HI> Books, Chapters, Sections, <HI>and
whatever el&s;e the Subject would admit of.
But as the Affairs of</HI> Greece <HI>and</HI> Rome
<HI>were very different, &s;o they could not be re|lated
altogether after the &s;ame manner.</HI>
Rome <HI>you &s;ee at one View, as well in its
Progre&s;s, as its Ri&s;e. For tho' in Proce&s;s
of Time &s;he branch'd out into &s;o many Colo|nies,
they were all Subject to her as their
Head; thence they receiv'd their Laws as
they were conquer'd; and they were always
one intire united People. Which makes
their Affairs admit of a more clear and even
Thread of Hi&s;tory, than tho&s;e of the</HI> Greci|ans;
<HI>who, be&s;ides that they had to do with
mo&s;t Parts of the then known World, were
<PB REF="20">
among them&s;elves &s;o many di&s;tinct Repub|licks,
almo&s;t wholly independent one of ano|ther,
differing in their Laws, and Cu&s;toms,
jealous of each others Superiority, and con|&s;equently
always jarring in their Intere&s;ts, un|le&s;s
when meer Nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd them to unite
again&s;t a common Enemy. So that in this
re&s;pect, one may &s;ay of them, as</HI> Florus <HI>did
of the</HI> Romans, <HI>that</HI> Theirs is not the Hi|&s;tory
of one People, but of Mankind. '<HI>Tis
true the &s;everal States of</HI> Greece <HI>agreed in
the main as to the one thing they contended
for, which was Liberty; but they had mo&s;t of
them different ways to obtain, and pre&s;erve
it: And hence proceeds &s;uch a Variety, and
Intricacy in their Affairs, that it is no ea|&s;ie
I ask to mar&s;hal &s;o many Events in due
Order of Time, and Place, and out of them
to collect an intire unbroken Body of Hi&s;tory.
This is what I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to
&s;ay in my own Vindication; tho' it is with|out
the lea&s;t thoughts of derogating from the
Merit of the</HI> Roman Hi&s;tory, <HI>which is &s;uf|ficiently
e&s;tabli&s;h'd both as to the U&s;efulne&s;s
of the De&s;ign, and the Exactne&s;s of the
Performance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to what further relates to this Un|dertaking,
the Reader will find</HI> Greece <HI>con|&s;ider'd
under two States: It is fir&s;t divided
into</HI> Kingdoms, <HI>the principal of which are
treated of &s;eparately in the fir&s;t Book, and
<PB REF="21">
carry'd down to the Abolition of the</HI> Regal
Power. <HI>The second Book con&s;iders it as
form'd into &s;ettled</HI> Common-wealths, <HI>and
relates its Affairs in a more united Manner.
To do this with the less Confu&s;ion, I have
observ'd a Rule of referring the chief Tran&s;|actions
to</HI> Athens <HI>as the Head, and menti|oning
the other States only as they had De|pendance
on it. For this reason I must own
a Liberty I have taken in the fir&s;t Book of
placing the</HI> Kingdom <HI>of</HI> Athens <HI>la&s;t, that
there might be no thorough Interruption in
the Story. Yet tho' I have been particularly
cautious of perplexing the Reader by too ma|ny
different Views, I have not neglected the
use of</HI> Chronology: <HI>In which I have chiefly
follow'd the Authority of Arch-Bishop</HI> U&s;her.
<HI>A&s;tronomical Niceties cannot be expected,
where a general Knowledge of the Time
is &s;ufficient; and if I have &s;ometimes made
u&s;e of a round Number, either as to Years,
Men, Ships, or the like, I hope it may be
allow'd in Ca&s;es of the mo&s;t remote Anti|quity,
e&s;pecially where the Difference in Hi|&s;torians
is &s;o great, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to
arrive at any Exactne&s;s. I have all along
intermix'd as much of the Antiquities, as
I thought nece&s;&s;ary to illustrate the Story.
And as I found my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;ay
&s;omething of Arts and Learning, in wri|ting
of a Country wherein they were &s;up|pos'd
<PB REF="22">
to have received their Birth, I have
a&s;&s;ign'd the general Periods of</HI> Poetry, <HI>and</HI>
Philo&s;ophy, <HI>and mention'd the greate&s;t Pro|&s;icients
in them, with a &s;hort Account of
their Per&s;ons and Writings. As this was
intended only for an</HI> Abridgment <HI>of the</HI>
Grecian <HI>Story, I have endeavour'd to reduce
the whole into as narrow a Compa&s;s as po&s;|&s;ible;
and notwith&s;tanding the great Variety
of Matter, I hope I have omitted nothing
material.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Original of GREECE, and
its Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>I. AS there has been a con&s;tant Di&s;pute
carry'd on by all Nations in their
Preten&s;ions to Antiquity, the <HI>Ae|gyptians,
Scythians,</HI> and others, who were re&s;ol|ved
not to be outdone by their Neighbours,
fancied them&s;elves the fir&s;t Race of Mankind,
and that they were of equal Duration with the
World. Nor can we exempt the <HI>Grecians</HI> from
their Share in this common Vanity; the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="26">
particularly gave out, That they were
produc'd at the &s;ame Time with the <HI>Sun,</HI>
and out of the &s;ame <HI>Soil</HI> that they inhabited.
However Pride and Emulation might contri|bute
to this Opinion, it might probably take
its Ri&s;e from the want of Letters, and Civil
Government in the fir&s;t Ages of the World;
and as from thence the Original of mo&s;t Na|tions
became ob&s;cure, &s;o con&s;equently mu&s;t the
mo&s;t plau&s;ible Accounts we have of them, be
very precarious. <HI>Greece</HI> we find in a more
particular manner labouring under the&s;e Diffi|culties:
For &s;he underwent a long Infancy,
and tho' &s;he often exerted her &s;elf, and &s;igna|liz'd
it by &s;ome generous Exploits; yet the
Fame of them being deliver'd down to Po&s;teri|ty,
either by uncertain Tradition, or rude im|perfect
Memoirs, gave occa&s;ion to their Hi&s;to|rians,
as well as Poets in &s;ucceeding Ages, to
make up in Fiction, what they wanted in au|thentick
Records. This is a &s;hort Account of
that which we call the <HI>Fabulous Age;</HI> and tho'
we find it &s;ufficiently clouded with Error and
Super&s;tition, yet there are &s;till &s;ome &s;catter'd
Intervals of Light, which mu&s;t &s;erve to direct
us in our Inquiry into the Birth of a People,
who have made &s;o glorious a Figure in the
World, as the <HI>Grecians.</HI> Upon the whole, we
may with &s;afety allot them a Place in Antiqui|ty,
but mu&s;t not give them the Precedency,
&s;ince it is allow'd by their own Hi&s;torians, that
they were In&s;tructed, and Civiliz'd by Colonies
planted among them from <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt;</HI>
the fir&s;t of which taught them Navigation,
Trade, and the U&s;e of Letters, and the latter
poli&s;h'd them by her Laws, gave them a ta&s;te
<PB N="3" REF="27">
of the Arts and Sciences, initiated them in her
My&s;teries, and in a Word gave them Kings
and Gods.</P>
<P>II. But before we treat of their Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;everal Name of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> it
will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a View of that Part of
the World, which went under the general
Name of <HI>Greece.</HI> As to the Name it &s;elf, the
<HI>Grecians</HI> were &s;o call'd either from a petty Bo|rough,
or <HI>Graecus</HI> a very ob&s;cure King, who&s;e
Subjects were thought to be originally Inha|bitants
of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and therefore &s;ome of the
ancient Authors confine <HI>Greece</HI> properly &s;o cal|led,
to that Country. This was an ancient
known Name among them; and the <HI>Romans</HI>
paid that ju&s;t Re&s;pect to their Antiquity, as to
call them by no other; but they &s;oon quitted
it them&s;elves for that of <HI>Hellenes</HI> or <HI>Achaei,</HI> tho'
one would wonder that a People &s;o fond of
Antiquity, &s;hould &s;o ea&s;ily part with the mo&s;t
eminent Mark of it. But it &s;eems it was a
Compliment &s;everal of their Kings expected
from them, &s;o that they chang'd their Names
almo&s;t as often as their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>But &s;ince, through a mixture of Pride and
Ignorance, they &s;eem to have corrupted the
Names of their <HI>Founders,</HI> and by that means
to have di&s;guis'd their true <HI>Origine,</HI> we mu&s;t
have Recour&s;e to the more ancient and un|doubted
Records of <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Greece</HI> was fir&s;t inhabited by the Sons
of <HI>Noah,</HI> as other Countries were, is a thing out
of di&s;pute, but by who&s;e immediate Po&s;terity,
is not &s;o generally allow'd. The Po&s;terity of
<HI>Japheth</HI> took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>I&s;les of the Gen|tiles,</HI>
which, according to the <HI>Hebrew Idiom,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="28">
comprehended not only &s;uch as were properly
&s;o call'd, but all tho&s;e Countries which lay
towards the Sea at any di&s;tance from <HI>Paelestine,</HI>
e&s;pecially between the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Mediterrane|an
Sea;</HI> and &s;o both <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> might
come under this Denomination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Javan <HI>thought to be the &s;ame with the</HI> Grecian Ion.</NOTE> His Son <HI>Ja|van</HI>
&s;eems mo&s;t probable to have peopled <HI>Greece,</HI>
from the exact Analogy he bears with the <HI>Gre|cian
Ion. Javan</HI> is the Scripture Word for
<HI>Greece;</HI> and it is ob&s;ervable, that tho' among
the <HI>Grecians</HI> themselves the <HI>Ionians</HI> were but a
Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> yet other Nations comprehend|ded
all under the Name of <HI>Ionians.</HI> The Me|mory
al&s;o of his Son <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> &s;eems to have been
pre&s;erv'd under the Name of the <HI>Aeoles,</HI> or
rather <HI>Elis</HI> of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> one part of which
by <HI>Homer</HI> is call'd <HI>Ali&s;ium;</HI> and &s;ome from
hence derive the <HI>Hellenes.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Colour the&s;e Opinions carry with
them, they are not &s;o unexceptionable, but
that we may give the <HI>Grecians</HI> leave to tell
their own Story. And of them the mo&s;t Ju|dicious
and Inqui&s;itive allow their Country
was fir&s;t inhabited by a barbarous People, dif|ferent
from them both in Language and Man|ners.
<HI>Strabo</HI> has given us a large Catalogue of
the <HI>Dryopes, Caucones, Leleges, Aones,</HI> and ma|ny
others: But the&s;e &s;eem not to have been
that ancient People, but &s;ome later Outca&s;ts
of the <HI>Carians,</HI> who made frequent Inroads
into <HI>Greece.</HI> So that the mo&s;t noted, and of
the greate&s;t Extent and Antiquity, were the
<HI>Pela&s;gi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of the</HI> Pela&s;gi.</NOTE> who&s;e fir&s;t or chief Place of Re&s;idence
was <HI>Arcadia;</HI> from whence the <HI>Arcadians</HI> chal|leng'd
to them&s;elves their Founder <HI>Pela&s;gus,</HI>
and from him deriv'd their Claim to an high|er
<PB N="5" REF="29">
Antiquity than their Neighbours. He pa&s;s'd
with them for an <HI>Autochthon,</HI> or <HI>Son of the
Earth,</HI> as the <HI>Grecians</HI> generally call'd tho&s;e of
whom they could give no better Account. But
as by this they betray'd their Ignorance of his
Original, &s;o they leave room for an Opinion
in&s;i&s;ted on by very learned Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pela&s;gus <HI>the &s;ame with</HI> Pha|leg.</NOTE> that by <HI>Pe|la&s;gus</HI>
was meant <HI>Peleg,</HI> or <HI>Phaleg:</HI> Which looks
like more than a probable Conjecture, if we
allow what is generally a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>Greece,</HI> and
indeed mo&s;t other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> were peopled
out of <HI>Scythia;</HI> from whence the Po&s;teri|ty
of <HI>Phaleg</HI> making their Way through <HI>Thrace,</HI>
and <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> which were already taken up by
the Sons of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> and others, might fix &s;ome
in <HI>Epirus,</HI> &s;ome in <HI>Hellas,</HI> and the greate&s;t part
in <HI>Pe&s;oponnelus,</HI> where they found the mo&s;t
empty and convenient Habitation. For it is
but rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the Places to|wards
the Sea were the la&s;t peopled, fir&s;t from
the want of the Conveniency of Navigation;
and afterwards, when that was e&s;tabli&s;h'd, for
fear of Pirates, who continually infe&s;ted their
Coa&s;ts. This De&s;cent of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Pha|leg</HI>
receives further Confirmation from the near
Affinity between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language and the
ancient <HI>Greek,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affinity be|tween the</HI> Grecian <HI>and</HI> Ea&s;tern <HI>Languages.</HI></NOTE>
which is almo&s;t univer&s;ally al|low'd
to be of <HI>Ea&s;tern Extraction.</HI> Nor can
we more plau&s;ibly account for the many <HI>Dia|lects,</HI>
into which the <HI>Greek</HI> was di&s;tingui&s;h'd,
than by its Mixture with other Languages:
And in the <HI>Dorick Dialect</HI> we have a plain In|&s;tance
of the broad Pronunciation &s;o peculiar
to the <HI>Oriental</HI> Tongues. There are al&s;o the
&s;ame Foot&s;teps of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Languages to be
met with in the Out-skirts of <HI>Greece,</HI> particu|larly
<PB N="6" REF="30">
in <HI>Crete</HI> and other I&s;lands, whither this
People naturally betook them&s;elves, as they
were expell'd <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> and the <HI>Continent.</HI>
Whoever the&s;e People were, we have no Ac|count
of them but under the Name of the <HI>Pela&s;gi;</HI>
from whom <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> had the Name
of <HI>Pela&s;gia.</HI> After they had di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves
throughout all <HI>Greece,</HI> they arriv'd in <HI>I|taly;</HI>
where they pa&s;s'd for the &s;ame with the
<HI>Tyrrheni,</HI> and as &s;uch were conceiv'd to be the
Original <HI>Founders</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> As they were a
&s;catter'd, wand'ring People, never throughly
&s;ettled, or incorporated with the other <HI>Greci|ans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hellen.</NOTE>
they were &s;orc'd to give way to <HI>Hellen,</HI>
who was generally reputed the Son of <HI>Deucalion,</HI>
tho' &s;ome &s;ay of <HI>Prometheus</HI> and <HI>Clymene,</HI> and o|thers
of <HI>Ion.</HI> He reign'd in <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> &s;ome time
after the <HI>Deucalionean Deluge,</HI> and being &s;eated
almo&s;t in the Heart of <HI>Greece,</HI> and he with his
Sons bearing a great Sway in tho&s;e Parts, main|tain'd
a Corre&s;pondence with the neighbouring
Cities, 'till by degrees they expell'd the la&s;t
Remains of the <HI>Pela&s;gi:</HI> And from thence it
was that he impos'd one Name, calling the
Country after him&s;elf <HI>Hellas,</HI> which was after|wards
call'd <HI>Phthiotis,</HI> and the People <HI>Hellenes.</HI>
This Name, tho' in Proce&s;s of time it was
transferr'd to &s;ignifie the whole Nation with
its Colonies, at fir&s;t reach'd no farther than his
own Dominions. For there were other Kings
as zealous as <HI>Hellen</HI> in propagating their Names,
in hopes it might prove a con&s;iderable Step
towards the <HI>universal Monarchy</HI> of <HI>Greece.</HI>
And this may account for the Variety of
Names we find, e&s;pecially among the Poets,
who us'd them promi&s;cuou&s;ly to expre&s;s the
<PB REF="31">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="7" REF="32">
Nation in general. The mo&s;t noted among
them were <HI>Achoai, Argivi, Danai, Dolopes, Hel|lenes,
Iones, Myrmidones,</HI> and <HI>Pela&s;gi,</HI> which
were particular Parts of Greece, &s;o call'd from
their re&s;pective Kings, or Founders. But as the
<HI>Grecians</HI> did nothing very con&s;iderable, either
at home or abroad, before the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, it
was that fir&s;t began to unite them under one
common Name, and Intere&s;t: Neither did they
pre&s;ume 'till after that to call the re&s;t of the
World <HI>Barbarians;</HI> that is, 'till they had one
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Name, and Nation to oppo&s;e to
them.</P>
<P>III. The Country which they anciently and
properly inhabited was <HI>Hellas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cripti|on of the Country.</NOTE> or <HI>Greece</HI> pro|perly
&s;o call'd, being the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Part of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
bounded chiefly by two Seas, the <HI>Ionian</HI>
on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> and the <HI>Aegean</HI> on the
<HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> which parts them from <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> On the
<HI>North</HI> was <HI>Macedonia, Illyricum,</HI> and <HI>Epirus;</HI>
both which latter had a mixt Dependance on
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and <HI>Barbarians.</HI> It was divided
by the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> a narrow Neck of Land be|tween
the two Seas; the large&s;t Part being with|out
the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> and the le&s;&s;er
within it to the <HI>South;</HI> which being &s;urroun|ded
every where by the Sea, except the <HI>I&s;th|mus,</HI>
made it a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> and from <HI>Pelops,</HI> who
reign'd there, was call'd <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> To the&s;e
Parts we may add the Multitude of I&s;lands,
which lye di&s;per&s;ed in the&s;e Seas: Of which
the mo&s;t remarkable is <HI>Crete,</HI> both for Fame and
Extent. The next are <HI>Euboea, Corcyra, Ce|phallenia,</HI>
and <HI>Zacynthus,</HI> with many others of
le&s;s Note. The&s;e Parts were al&s;o &s;ubdivided
<PB N="8" REF="33">
into le&s;s Countries, in the nature of Provinces:
The mo&s;t noted of which in the flouri&s;hing
Times of <HI>Greece</HI> were <HI>The&s;&s;aly, Locri Epicnemi|dii,
Opuntii,</HI> and <HI>Ozolae,</HI> the latter of which
lying more We&s;tward, is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd by
the Name of <HI>Locri He&s;perii, Baeotia, Attica,
Megaris, Phocis, Aeolia, Acarnania,</HI> and <HI>Do|ris;</HI>
all without the <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> Within the I&s;th|mus
were <HI>Achaia, Elis, Me&s;&s;enia, Laconia,
Argolis,</HI> and <HI>Arcadia,</HI> all comprehended under
the general Name of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were the native fix'd Seats of the <HI>Gre|cians,</HI>
'till increa&s;ing in Power, and pre&s;s'd with
Numbers, they threw them&s;elves out in Co|lonies,
and &s;o inlarg'd their Territories. By
the&s;e means they got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as well of the
remoter Parts, as tho&s;e which border'd upon
them, e&s;pecially the Sea-Coa&s;ts of <HI>Macedonia,
Thrace, Illyricum</HI> and <HI>Epirus;</HI> as al&s;o of <HI>Sicily,</HI>
the large&s;t I&s;land in <HI>Europe</HI> next our own,
with the <HI>Southern</HI> Part of <HI>Italy;</HI> both which
from the many Colonies planted there went
under the Name of <HI>Magna Graecia.</HI> As for
<HI>Macedonia</HI> in general, we are not yet to con&s;ider
it as a Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> 'till by a large Acce&s;&s;i|on
of Territory it grew formidable to the mo&s;t
remote and powerful States of <HI>Greece;</HI> and from
thence laid the Foundation of that Sovereignty
it &s;oon after a&s;&s;um'd under the Title of the
<HI>Third Monarchy.</HI> They had al&s;o in the <HI>Le&s;&s;er

<PB N="9" REF="34">
Colonies we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention
more particularly, as they fall in with the
Body of the Story. It may &s;uffice in general,
that they got footing in mo&s;t parts of the old
known World; and where-ever they planted
their Colonies, they generally propagated by
them their Race, Religion, Laws, Cu&s;toms,
and Language.</P>
<P>IV. We have no particular Account of the
State of <HI>Greece</HI> before the Foundation of her
<HI>Royalties;</HI> nor indeed can we expect any thing
worth our Notice from a People who were at
that time rude and unpoli&s;h'd even to Barbari|ty.
For it is certain they were unacquainted
with Agriculture, Building, and all the earli|e&s;t
and mo&s;t natural Inventions of providing
for the common Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, having no
Law but Force, and grazing like Bea&s;ts in the
open Air. So that to give them the lea&s;t
Tincture of Humanity, was &s;ufficient to gain
from them the Title of King, or God; wit|ne&s;s
the Divine Honours they paid to their
<HI>Pela&s;gus,</HI> who built them a &s;ort of Cottages to
fence them from the Inclemency of the Air,
clothed them with the Skins of Bea&s;ts, and
taught them to feed on Acorns, as a more whole|&s;ome
Nouri&s;hment than that of Herbs. This
new Diet, whatever other good Effects it
might have, wrought no great Change in their
Manners; &s;o that <HI>Greece</HI> was not for &s;everal Ages
after inhabited in any con&s;tant &s;ettled way. They
were &s;till the &s;ame lawle&s;s Rout, continually
roving and removing from one Place to ano|ther;
and &s;uch as were not content with their
own Fortune, were ea&s;ily tempted to invade
<PB N="10" REF="35">
their Neighbours. In this general Conte&s;t the
riche&s;t Countries fell to the &s;tronge&s;t: But as
the Conque&s;t was ea&s;ie, &s;o the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was
&s;hort, they being &s;oon &s;ucceeded by others up|on
the &s;ame Title. For this Rea&s;on <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI>
and <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and indeed all the fertile Re|gions
of <HI>Greece,</HI> chang'd their Ma&s;ters every
Year, with a great Part of their Inhabitants.
The Country which was lea&s;t mole&s;ted upon
the&s;e Accounts, was <HI>Attica;</HI> and it is imputed
chiefly to the Barrenne&s;s of its Soil. For there
being nothing worth contending for, the In|habitants
were continued quietly in a long and
regular De&s;cent: and this gave the <HI>A$enians</HI>
the be&s;t Title to Antiquity, or at lea&s;t the be&s;t
Proofs of it. But the greate&s;t Advantage was,
that it made them exert them&s;elves &s;ooner than
their Neighbours; it quicken'd their Inventi|ons,
di&s;pos'd them to a more ea&s;ie Reception
of Arts and Literature, when they got footing
among them, and in a manner laid the Foun|dation
of all that Grandeur, to which they af|terwards
arriv'd.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Greece</HI> in general, the other
Parts of it were over-run with Spoil and Ra|pine.
The continual Fear of being di&s;plac'd
made them live as it were by Chance, with|out
any further Pro&s;pect than their pre&s;ent Su|&s;tenance;
and &s;o cramp'd their Indu&s;try in ge|neral,
that we find nothing of the Arts and
Sciences at that time among them, no Trade
or Commerce, or any other happy Effects of
Peace and Security. They at la&s;t grew &s;en&s;i|ble
of the Nece&s;&s;ity there was of Civil Socie|ty,
as a Means to &s;ecure them from Violence
and Oppre&s;&s;ion. This put them upon impro|ving
<PB N="11" REF="36">
their Notions of Building; &s;o that their
Hou&s;es increa&s;ing in Number as well as Beau|ty,
grew in&s;en&s;ibly into <HI>Boroughs,</HI> and they
&s;ome time after into Cities. But neither could
this Advantage of Cohabitation throughly tame
and &s;often their Tempers; that being a peculi|ar
Honour re&s;erv'd (as was hinted before) for
<HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Phaenicia.</HI></P>

&s;ome Allowances for &s;uch a va&s;t Di&s;tance of
Time, and the want of Records; and &s;uppo&s;ing
<HI>Sicyon</HI> to be peopl'd &s;o early, as from the Fruit|fulne&s;s

rea&s;onably conclude it was, and we may yet
believe She had her Kings, that being the Go|vernment
which obtain'd in mo&s;t Countries, as
they came to be inhabited, after the Flood.</P>
<P>II. We can only ob&s;erve of the fir&s;t Kings
of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, that they are repre&s;ented
as Per&s;ons of great Worth and Renown, who
for their Courage, Prudence and other Virtues,
<PB N="15" REF="39">
were cho&s;en by the free and univer&s;al Con&s;ent
of the People. There &s;eems by their long and
quiet Reigns to have been a per&s;ect good Un|der&s;tanding
between Prince and People; who
as they yielded an intire and voluntary Obe|dience,
&s;o the Kings cho&s;e to Command rather
by Love, and E&s;teem of their Merit, than by the
Force of their Arms, and a &s;lavi&s;h Dread of
their Power. In all their Actions they pre|ferr'd
the Good of their Subjects, for who&s;e
Protection they knew and acknowledg'd them|&s;elves
to have been advanc'd, before any cove|tous
or ambitious De&s;igns of their own; and
the People plac'd &s;uch a Confidence in the E|quity
of their Prince, that <HI>Greece</HI> had not for
&s;everal Ages, after it was a little Civiliz'd, any
&s;tanding Laws, but the indefinite Will and Sen|tence
of its Kings. But this Harmony being
de&s;troy'd in &s;ucceeding Ages by Policy, Inte|re&s;t
and Thir&s;t of Empire, the People, as Op|portunity
offer'd, re&s;um'd the Power into their
own Hands; and this gave Ri&s;e to more different
Forms of Government in <HI>Greece,</HI> than in any other
Parts, or perhaps in the whole World be&s;ides.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Sicyon,</HI> it is certain that King|dom
never made any mighty Figure in this long
tract of Time, and that may be the chief Rea|&s;on
of its Ob&s;curity. Thus it lyes involv'd in
the Fate of &s;everal other petty Royalties, which
never contended for Superiority with the leading
States of <HI>Greece;</HI> &s;o that were it not for &s;ome
of their Princes Names, which are re&s;cu'd from
Oblivion by the Poets, we &s;hould never know
there had been any &s;uch Kingdoms in the

is the fir&s;t who did any thing memorable in

by attributing to all what was done by one,

from whence he return'd with &s;ome con&s;idera|ble
Force, seiz'd upon <HI>Tyrinthe,</HI> and gave his
Brother Battel, wherein they are the first re|corded
to have us'd Targets.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Targets fir&s;t us'd.</HI></NOTE> But it not be|ing
a deci&s;ive Battel, they came to an Accom|modation,
and divided the Kingdom, &s;o far at lea&s;t,
that <HI>Acri&s;ius</HI> kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Argos,</HI>
and let his Brother enjoy <HI>Tyrinthe,</HI> and &s;ome
other Maritime Places. <HI>Acri&s;ius</HI> had one only
<PB N="22" REF="46">
Daughter nam'd <HI>Danae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Danae.</NOTE> who the Oracle told
him &s;hould have a Son that would procure his
Death.</P>
<P>But before we proceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of Oracles.</HI></NOTE> it may not be ami&s;s
to give &s;ome Account of the&s;e <HI>Oracles,</HI> which
made up &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the <HI>Grecian
Super&s;tition.</HI> They were rank'd among the no|ble&s;t
and mo&s;t religious kinds of Divination,
the De&s;ign of them being to &s;ettle &s;uch an im|mediate
way of Conver&s;e with their Gods, as
to be able by them not only to explain things
intricate and ob&s;cure, but al&s;o to anticipate the
Knowledge of future Events, and that with far
greater Certainty than they could hope for
from Men, who out of Ignorance and Preju|dice
mu&s;t &s;ometimes either conceal, or betray
the Truth. So that this became the only &s;afe
way of deliberating upon Affairs of any Con|&s;equence,
either publick or private. Whether
to proclaim War, or conclude a Peace, to in|&s;titute
a new Form of Government, or enact
new Laws, all was to be done with the Ad|vice
and Approbation of the Oracle, who&s;e De|terminations
were always held &s;acred and invio|lable.
As to the Cau&s;es of Oracles, <HI>Jupiter</HI>
was look'd upon as the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of this and
all other &s;orts of Divination; he had the Book
of Fate before him, and out of that reveal'd
either more or le&s;s, as he pleas'd, to <HI>inferior
Demons.</HI> But to argue more rationally, this
way of Acce&s;s to the Gods has been branded as
one of the earlie&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t pieces of <HI>Prie&s;t|craft,</HI>
that obtain'd in the World. For the
Prie&s;ts, who&s;e Dependance was on the Oracles,
when they found the Cheat had got &s;ufficient
footing, allow'd no Man to con&s;ult the Gods

without co&s;tly Sacrifices and rich Pre&s;ents to
them&s;elves: And as few could bear this Ex|pence,
it &s;erv'd to rai&s;e their Credit among the
common People, by keeping them at an awful
di&s;tance. And to heighten rheir E&s;teem with
the better and wealthier Sort, even they were
only admitted upon a few &s;tated Days. By
which the thing appear'd &s;till more my&s;terious,
and for want of this good Management mu&s;t
quickly have been &s;een through, and fell to
the ground. But whatever juggling there was
as to the Religious Part, Oracles had certainly
a good Effect as to the Publick, being admirably
&s;uited to the Genius of a People, who would
join in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Expedition, and ad|mit
of any Change of Government, when they
under&s;tood by the Oracle it was the irre&s;i&s;ti|ble
Will of the Gods. This was the Method
<HI>Minos, Lycurgus,</HI> and all the famous Law-gi|vers
took; and indeed they found the People
&s;o intirely devoted to this part of Religion,
that it was generally the ea&s;ie&s;t, and &s;ometimes
the only way of winning them into a Compli|ance.
And then they took care to have them
deliver'd in &s;uch ambiguous Terms, as to ad|mit
of different Con&s;tructions according to the
Exigency of the times; &s;o that they were ge|nerally
interpreted to the Advantage of the
State, unle&s;s &s;ometimes there happen'd to be
Bribery, or Flattery in the Ca&s;e; as when <HI>De|mo&s;thenes</HI>

Ver&s;e. They found a &s;ecret Charm in

and weighty: And hence it became the
general Practice of Legi&s;lators, and Philo&s;ophers,
to deliver their Laws and Maxims in that
Dre&s;s; and &s;carce any thing in tho&s;e Ages
was writ of Excellence or Moment, but in Ver&s;e.
This was the Dawn of <HI>Poetry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dawn of Poetry.</HI></NOTE> which &s;oon
grew into Repute; and &s;o long as it &s;erv'd to

Poets were highly honour'd, and admitted into a

more mean and &s;ervile Ends; and as they pro|&s;tituted
their Mu&s;e, and deba&s;ed the Subject,
they &s;unk proportionably in their E&s;teem and
Dignity. As to the Hi&s;tory of Oracles, we
find them mention'd in the very <HI>Infancy</HI> of
<HI>Greece;</HI> and it is as uncertain when they were
finally extinct, as when they begun. For they
often lo&s;t their Prophetick Faculty for &s;ome
time, and recover'd it again. I know 'tis a
common Opinion, that they were univer&s;ally
&s;ilenc'd upon our <HI>Saviour's</HI> Appearance in the

<P>To return to <HI>Acri&s;ius;</HI> upon this Advice of
the Oracle, he kept his Daughter <HI>Danae</HI> un|der

with an Army out of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and conque|red
her. So that this Expedition may be more
properly plac'd after his Return home upon his

after he had deliver'd her from a Sea-mon|&s;ter,

<HI>Perfeus</HI> happening to meet him at &s;ome publick

<P>Per&s;$us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The repu|ted Fall of</HI> Argos <HI>upon the Death of</HI> Acri&s;ius.</NOTE> upon the foremention'd Accident,
took &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to <HI>Argos,</HI> that he tran|&s;lated
the Regal Seat to <HI>Mycenoe,</HI> where he

and therefore a&s;&s;ign but one Succe&s;&s;ion of
Kings to both Places. But others affirm, with

<P>III. Amid&s;t the&s;e Uncertainties let us return
to <HI>Mycenoe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foundation of</HI> Mycenae <HI>by</HI> Per&s;eus</NOTE> where we left Per&s;eus &s;ettling his

it does not appear, that the <HI>Grecians</HI> had yet
made any Inroads into the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> much le&s;s with
a Body of Men &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue &s;uch a va&s;t

Alums</HI> Father of <HI>Amphitryon, Sthenelus, Ele|ctyon</HI>
and <HI>Ma&s;tor.</HI> It is thought he was &s;ac|ceeded
by <HI>Ma&s;tor,</HI> and he by his Brother <HI>Ele|ctryon</HI>
Father of <HI>Alcmena.</HI> But this Opinion
not being generally receiv'd, we mu&s;t look up|on
<PB N="28" REF="53">
on <HI>Sthenelus</HI> as his immediate Succe&s;&s;or;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sthenelus</NOTE> and to
&s;alve the&s;e Difficulties, have Recour&s;e to the
common Method of <HI>Chronologers,</HI> who a&s;&s;ign to
&s;ome of the &s;ucceeding Kings an Over-plus of
Years to account for the two former, who&s;e
Reigns are uncertain. <HI>Sthenelus</HI> reign'd eight
Years, and by <HI>A&s;tydamia</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Pe|lops</HI>
left <HI>Eury&s;theus</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ery&s;the|us.</NOTE> who is noted
for the difficult Tasks he impos'd on <HI>Alcoeus,</HI>
better known by his Sirname <HI>Hercules,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Account of</HI> Hercules.</NOTE> given
him upon the Fame of his Exploits; of whom
we mu&s;t give &s;ome Account, &s;ince his Actions
are the mo&s;t talk'd of, tho' with the lea&s;t Cer|tainty,
of all the Heroes of Antiquity. For
&s;ome reckon up three, others four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many of that Name.</NOTE> <HI>Cicero</HI> six,
and <HI>Varro</HI> forty four of this Name. Almo&s;t
every Age and Country had its <HI>Hercules,</HI> it
being a common Cu&s;tom to call the mo&s;t an|cient
Kings by the Name of <HI>Saturn,</HI> their Sons
by that of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the mo&s;t Valiant and
Active of their Grand-&s;ons by this of <HI>Hercules.</HI>
Hence it became difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h among
so many; and therefore the Actions of all are
generally a&s;crib'd to this latter: So that it is ea|&s;ier
to &s;ay he was certainly very eminent in his
Time, than to tell you by what Means he be|came
&s;o. This <HI>Hercules</HI> was the Son of <HI>Am|phitryon</HI>
and <HI>Alcmena,</HI> both de&s;cended immedi|ately
from <HI>Perseus;</HI> tho' the Poets a&s;&s;ign <HI>Jupiter</HI>
for his Father, which may be under&s;tood of
&s;ome neighbouring Prince. His early Valour,
and being &s;o nearly related to the Crown, gave
<HI>Eury&s;theus</HI> &s;ufficient Umbrage; who therefore,
to be honourably rid of him, put him upon all
the dangerous Enterprizes he could devi&s;e. The
chief of which are included in his <HI>Twelve La|bours:</HI>

<PB N="29" REF="55">
But they are de&s;crib'd in &s;o Romantick
a manner, that it is hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the
Gravity of Hi&s;tory to relate them. For what
shall we &s;ay to his <HI>Nemean Lion,</HI> his <HI>Hydra,</HI>
his <HI>Erymanthian Boar,</HI> and the re&s;t of his in|credible
Acts, unle&s;s we under&s;tand by them
the mo&s;t notorious Robbers, Murderers, and
Tyrants &s;ubdu'd by him, which, like &s;o many
<HI>Pe&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Monrers of Mankind,</HI> at that time
infe&s;ted the World? To the&s;e twelve Labours,
which he perform'd chiefly at the In&s;tigation
of <HI>Eury&s;theus,</HI> who&s;e Jealou&s;ie gave the chief
ri&s;e to his Glory, we may add &s;everal others
which he undertook of him&s;elf: And our E|&s;teem
of them is not &s;o much the Effect of
a blind Zeal for Antiquity, as the Respect
Men naturally have for a generous Valour,
which protects the weak in&s;tead of in&s;ulting
them, and is &s;o far from committing Violence,
that it is always be&s;t pleas'd, and employ'd in
repre&s;&s;ing it. But withal it must be own'd
there was a great deal of the Spirit of <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI>
in the&s;e fir&s;t Ages of the World,
when the Heroes were not content to &s;ignalize
them&s;elves at home by freeing their Country,
but rov'd about in Search of foreign Adven|tures.
And hither may be referr'd the famous
<HI>Expedition</HI> of the <HI>Argonauts;</HI> which falling in
with the&s;e Times, and being the fir&s;t recorded
of that kind, must not be omitted.</P>
<P>The chief Captain of this Voyage was Ja|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Expedition of the</HI> Ar|gonauts.</NOTE>
a young Prince of <HI>Jolcus</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> the
Son of <HI>Aeon,</HI> and fourth in De&s;cent from <HI>Ae|lus;</HI>
who was put upon it by <HI>Pelias</HI> his Uncle,
who had u&s;urp'd the Kingdom. <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> reflect|ing
with him&s;elf what Renown <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> and o|thers
<PB N="30" REF="56">
had lately gain'd, clos'd with his Advice;
and declaring his Intention, was &s;econded by
many young Noblemen, in&s;omuch that above
fifty of the Flower of <HI>Greece</HI> gave in their
Names to the Expedition. The chief of which,
be&s;ides <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> were <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who
al&s;o writ an Account of it, <HI>Oileus</HI> Father of the
younger <HI>Ajax, Telamon</HI> Father of the other
<HI>Ajax,</HI> with his Brother <HI>Peleus</HI> Father of <HI>A|chilles,</HI>
both the Sons of <HI>Aeacus, Ca&s;tor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux</HI> Sons of <HI>Tyndareus</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and
<HI>Argus</HI> who built the Ship, which from him
was call'd <HI>Argo,</HI> and his Companions <HI>Argo|nautoe.</HI>
The De&s;ign of their Voyage was to fetch back the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> as the Fable calls
it, from Aeetes King of Colchos in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> or in
more plain terms to plunder him of &s;ome va&s;t
Trea&s;ure, which they had heard was in his
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Accordingly they fet fail from a
Bay in <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> near <HI>$olcus,</HI> And having touch'd
at <HI>Lemnos,</HI> and other Places, met with &s;everal
fabulous Encounters in their Pa&s;&s;age and Re|turn,
too many, and too incredible to enume|rate.
Such were the <HI>Symplegades, the Syrens,</HI>
the Harpies, Scylla and Charybdis, which were
di&s;guis'd by <HI>Orpheus</HI> under Poetical Morals,
And &s;eem to have been copied afterwards by
<HI>Homer</HI> in his Travels of <HI>Vly&s;&s;es.</HI> But being
arriv'd at <HI>Colchos,</HI> by the Afliflance of <HI>Medea</HI> the
King's Daughter, who fell in Love with <HI>Ja|&s;on,</HI>
they got the Trea&s;ure, and return'd home,
taking <HI>Medea</HI> with them by way of Repri&s;al,
(as they gave out) for <HI>Io,</HI> who was formerly
&s;tole from <HI>Argos. Medea</HI> was marry'd to <HI>$a|&s;on,</HI>
and afterwards, upon his abandoning her,
to <HI>Aegeus</HI> King of <HI>Athens;</HI> where her Skill in
<PB N="31" REF="57">
Magick and Witchcraft, and her many tragi|cal
Adventures, have furni&s;h'd &s;ufficient mat|ter
for the Stage.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Hercules,</HI> his End is made to be
of a piece with the mo&s;t extravagant Scenes of
his Life. His Applau&s;e in the World had gain|ed
him a &s;ufficient number both of Wives and
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; of whom the mo&s;t noted were <HI>Me|gara,
Iole, Deianeira,</HI> and <HI>Omphale:</HI> And whe|ther
he fell a Sacrifice to their jealous Re&s;ent|ment
by Poi&s;on, or burnt him&s;elf in a fit of
Phrenzy upon Mount <HI>Oeta,</HI> or what el&s;e became
of him, more than that he dy'd about the fifty
&s;econd Year of his Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Death of</HI> Hercules.</NOTE> is not ea&s;ily determin'd.
<HI>Eury&s;teus</HI> continu'd his Re&s;entment even after
his Death, and exprefs'd it to his Children, by
commanding <HI>Hyllus</HI> and the re&s;t, about &s;ixty in
number, as they grew up, to quit <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI>
They not being in a Capacity to re&s;i&s;t him,
betook them&s;elves to <HI>Athens,</HI> where they were
harbour'd and protected. <HI>Eury&s;theus</HI> finding
them thus &s;ettled in a Body, and carrying it
high upon their own De&s;cent, and their Fa|ther's
Merit, thought them &s;till too near him;
and therefore invaded <HI>Attica,</HI> with a de&s;ign to
extirpate them. But by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<HI>Athenians</HI> they made head again&s;t him, and &s;lew
both him and his Sons in the forty third Year
of his Reign; and then in their turn invaded
<HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> But the Plague raging there, and
the Oracle attributing it to their coming before
their time, they retir'd to <HI>Marathon.</HI> After
three Years they made another Attempt: For
&s;o they interpreted the Oracle, which told 'em
they mu&s;t &s;tay <HI>three Crops,</HI> but by which was
meant <HI>three Generations.</HI> The Armies being
<PB N="32" REF="58">
about to engage, <HI>Hyllus</HI> would decide the Quar|rel

his Uncle <HI>Atreus</HI> the Son of <HI>Pelops;</HI> who upon
his Nephew's Death kept Po&s;&s;c&s;&s;ion of it for him|&s;elf:
And hence the <HI>Pelopidae</HI> got the A&s;cendant
over the <HI>Per&s;eides,</HI> and became in effect Ma|&s;ters
of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Atrcus.</NOTE> <HI>Atreus</HI> is thought to have
reign'd jointly with his Brother <HI>Thye&s;tes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thye&s;tes.</NOTE> But
this latter being taken in Adultery with his
Wife <HI>Aerope,</HI> was bani&s;h'd; and when he was
afterwards recall'd, <HI>Atreus</HI> kill'd his Children,
and &s;erv'd them up to him at Table; whence
aro&s;e the Proverb of <HI>Thye&s;tes's Supper.</HI> At the
Horror of this Fact the Sun was &s;aid to go
back; by which &s;ome underhand <HI>Atreus's</HI> Skill

is al&s;o another Brother mention'd by the Name
of <HI>Pli&s;thenes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pli&s;thenes.</NOTE> Father of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Mene|laus,</HI>
who are therefore to be accounted only
the adpoted Sons of <HI>Atreus,</HI> to who&s;e Care they
<PB N="33" REF="59">
were committed. But <HI>Pli&s;thenes</HI> was rather
the Son of <HI>Atreus;</HI> and if he &s;ucceeded him,
(as it is probable he did) his Years may be
comprehended under <HI>Atreus</HI> and <HI>Thye&s;tes,</HI> to
whom is a&s;&s;ign'd a Reign of &s;ixty five Years.
However, it is certain <HI>Agamemnon</HI> &s;ucceeded as
next Heir of the <HI>Pelopidae:</HI> Who being a Prince
of Prudence and Courage, obtain'd the Sove|reignty
not only of <HI>Mycenae</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> but of
all as tar as <HI>Sicyon</HI> and <HI>Corinth,</HI> and the Coun|try
which was afterwards call'd <HI>Achaia.</HI> It
was no &s;mall Addition to his Titles to be cho|&s;en
General of the Expedition again&s;t <HI>Troy;</HI>
which happening at this time, mu&s;t be more
than barely mention'd, &s;ince it was an Action
wherein all the Parts of <HI>Greece</HI> were almo&s;t e|qually
concern'd.</P>
<P>IV. The De&s;trudion of <HI>Troy</HI> is one of the
mo&s;t famous <HI>Epocha's</HI> of Antiquity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King|dom, and War of</HI> Troy.</NOTE> being the
fir&s;t Term to which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Hi&s;torians re|ferr'd
their mo&s;t remarkable Tran&s;actions. It
was this Enterprize that properly put an end to
the <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> wherein &s;he try'd her
united Forces, and forewarn'd <HI>A&s;ia</HI> that &s;he
&s;hould one day &s;ubmit to her Yoke. But be|fore
we proceed to Particulars, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to premi&s;e &s;omething of the Certainty
of this War, which is not &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd, but
that &s;everal have call'd in Que&s;ion either the
Whole, or the greate&s;t Part of what the An|cients
have left us concerning it. For &s;ome will
not allow there ever were &s;uch Per&s;ons living as
<HI>Agamemnon, Achilles, Hector, Paris</HI> and <HI>Helena.</HI>
Others pretend to collect from ancient Aegyp|tian
Monuments, that <HI>Helena</HI> was actually mar|ry'd
<PB N="34" REF="60">
to <HI>Paris</HI> the Son of <HI>Priam;</HI> again&s;t whom
the <HI>Grecians</HI> out of a Motive of Jealou&s;ie en|ter'd
into a general Confederacy, and were
wor&s;ted in &s;everal Conflicts, in one of which
<HI>Achilles</HI> was &s;lain by <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the <HI>Grecians</HI> were far
from being exact in their Annals; from which
Neglect, together with the additional Fictions
of the Poets, by which they were adulterated,
have proceeded &s;o many different Accounts of
their mo&s;t noted Occurrences. But as the Ruins
of <HI>Troy</HI> are undeniable Arguments of its former
Greatne&s;s, they who reject the Story as
fabulous, a&s;cribe its Fall to Earthquakes and In|undations,
and call the Elements to their Aid to
maintain the Te&s;timony of a certain <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Prie&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to the common Con&s;ent
both of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Hi&s;torians. As to the
<HI>Hi&s;torians</HI> them&s;elves, it mu&s;t own'd mo&s;t of
tho&s;e who are tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, liv'd
&s;ome Ages after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War: (For <HI>Dares
Phrygius,</HI> and <HI>Dictys Creten&s;is,</HI> as they appear
now in the World, can hardly be accounted
<HI>Genuine.</HI>) But it does not from thence follow,
that they had no Authority but that of <HI>Homer</HI>
for what they &s;aid. For neither was <HI>Homer</HI>
the fir&s;t and only Author, (as &s;ome will have
it) who gave an Account of this Expedition,
There are &s;everal recorded before him, from
whom undoubtedly he copy'd, as others did
from him. And as &s;ome reject the whole Sto|ry,
&s;o others greedily catch at the leaft Re|mains
of Antiquity. They fancy the <HI>Ilias</HI> a
faithful, intire Narrative, and will rather take
from the <HI>Author</HI> the Title of a <HI>Poet,</HI> than not
put him in the fame Rank with &s;olid Hi&s;to|rians.
<PB N="35" REF="61">
There is certainly a <HI>Medium</HI> to be ob|&s;erv'd
between there <HI>Extremes;</HI> of which <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
him&s;elf, as being the great Ma&s;ter from
whom we derive our Rules of Poetry, was &s;en|&s;ible.
He knew he might vary from the Truth
as to <HI>Particulars,</HI> tho' not as to the main <HI>Sub|ject;</HI>
that he might adorn his Poem with <HI>Pro|bable
Fal&s;ities,</HI> but that the <HI>Principal Action</HI>
ought always to have &s;ome real Foundation in
Hi&s;tory. How far he has ob&s;erv'd this Rule,
will better appear by taking a &s;hort Survey of
the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Troy,</HI> from the fir&s;t Accounts we
have of it.</P>
<P>What <HI>Troy</HI> was originally before <HI>Teucer's</HI>
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Teucer.</NOTE> and how long he reign'd there, we are
not &s;ufficiently inform'd. And therefore the
Foundation of it is generally a&s;crib'd to <HI>Darda|nus</HI>
an <HI>Arcadian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dardanus.</NOTE> who with &s;everal of his Coun|trymen
under his Conduct coa&s;ting along <HI>Europe</HI>
touch'd at <HI>Samothrace,</HI> and from thence &s;eated
him&s;elf in <HI>Phrygia</HI> a Province of <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI>
where <HI>Teucer</HI> was King; who gave him his
Daughter, and with her &s;ome Ground near the
Sea, where he built the City, which with the
Territory was from him&s;elf called <HI>Dardania.</HI>
Upon this account &s;ome fancy he reign'd jointly
with his Father-in-Law: But it is more certain
he &s;ucceeded him in his whole Dominions, and
the People before call'd <HI>Teucri</HI> were from him
nam'd <HI>Dardani.</HI> Whatever the <HI>Grecians</HI> fay
of their <HI>Trojan</HI> Expedition, which they would
have con&s;ider'd as a <HI>Prelude</HI> to their Conque&s;ts
over the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> from hence it appears that
the <HI>Trojans</HI> were properly a <HI>Grecian</HI> Colony.
Be&s;ides they had <HI>Grecian</HI> Names, wor&s;hip'd
the fame Divinities; and <HI>Homer</HI> has left room
<PB N="36" REF="62">
to conjecture, that they &s;poke the &s;ame Lan|guage:
Otherwi&s;e it is hard to conceive, how
a Poet u&s;ed to be particular in the minute&s;t
Circum&s;tances almo&s;t to tri&s;ling, &s;hould de|&s;cribe
&s;uch frequent Conferences without ever
employing an Interpreter between them.
<HI>Dardanus,</HI> after a Reign of' &s;ixty five Years, left the
Kingdom to his Son <HI>Ericthonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ericthoni|us.</NOTE> who was re|ported
to have been extreamly rich and fortu|nate.
He, after forty &s;ix Years, was &s;ucceeded
by his Son <HI>Tros,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tros.</NOTE> from whom the Country took
the Name of <HI>Troas,</HI> and the City, <HI>Troja.
Tros</HI> had three Sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His three Sons,</HI> Ilus, A&s;&s;aracus, <HI>and</HI> Ga|nymede.</NOTE> <HI>Ilus, A&s;&s;aracus</HI> and <HI>Gany|mede.</HI>
From <HI>A&s;&s;aracus</HI> is deriv'd the Pedigree
of <HI>Aeneas. Ganymede</HI> was &s;tole away by <HI>Tan|talus</HI>
Father of <HI>Pelops,</HI> and by con&s;equence
Great Grand-father to <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> which being
highly relented by his Brother <HI>Ilus,</HI> he drove
<HI>Tantalus</HI> out of his Territories, and made him
fly for Refuge into <HI>Greece,</HI> where with his Son
<HI>Pelops</HI> (as was before hinted) he laid the Foun|dation
of the <HI>Pelopidae.</HI> This became the
Grounds of an hereditary Quarrel between the
Families of <HI>Priam</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> and was
probably the chief, tho' not the common re|puted
Cau&s;e of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. For it &s;eems
to have been by way of $word$, that <HI>Paris, Ilus's</HI>

Ilus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ilus.</NOTE> after forty nine Years, &s;ucceeded his Fa|ther

who give it to <HI>Dardanus,</HI> and believe the o|thers
<PB N="37" REF="63">
only enlarg'd and bcautify'd it, and
chang'd the Name. <HI>Ilus,</HI> after forty Years, left
the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Laomedon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laome|don.</NOTE> who by
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> walled
in the City, or in other terms rifted their Tem|ples
to defray the Expence: For which piece
of Sacrilege, and not making Re&s;titution, the
Oracle told him there was no other way of
appea&s;ing the Gods but by expo&s;ing a <HI>Trojan</HI>
Virgin to be devour'd by a Sea-mon&s;ter: The
lot fell upon his own Daughter <HI>He&s;ione;</HI> who
was refcu'd by <HI>Hercules,</HI> and the Mon&s;ter kill'd.
But <HI>Laomedon,</HI> who was noted for Perjury,
denying the Reward he had promis'd for this
Service, <HI>Hercules</HI> laid Siege to the City, took
and plunder'd it, kill'd <HI>Laomedon,</HI> and took his
Son <HI>Podarces</HI> Pri&s;oncr, who was afterwards re|deem'd
by the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and from thence had
the Name of <HI>Priamus.</HI> Some make <HI>Priam</HI> ra|ther
a&s;&s;i&s;ting to <HI>Hercules</HI> than otherwi&s;e; and
that, for his Integrity and Ju&s;tice, he was
plac'd by him in his Father's Throne, after a
Reign of forty four Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priamu$.</NOTE> <HI>Priam</HI> had a large
Extent of Dominion, reaching from <HI>Tenedos</HI>
to the Upper <HI>Phrygia,</HI> containing nine Provin|ces,
with a proportionable number of Towns.
He rebuilt the City and the Wall, and made
it more defen&s;ible with Forts and Ba&s;tions,
which from thence took the Name of <HI>Pergama.</HI>
His Court was full of Pomp and Sp'endor;
and thus for many Years he enjoy'd an unin|terrupted
Scene of Pro&s;perity. To add to
which, he had a numerous I&s;&s;ue of fifty Sons,
great part of them legitimate by <HI>Hecuba</HI> his fe|cond
Wife. She dream'd, when &s;he was big
with <HI>Paris,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould be deliver'd of a
<PB N="38" REF="64">
Fire-brand, which &s;hould reduce the City to
A&s;hes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Son Paris.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon <HI>Priam</HI> expos'd the Infant
upon Mount <HI>Ida:</HI> But by his Mother's Care
and Compa&s;&s;ion, he was brought up among
the Shepherds; and from &s;ignalizing him&s;elf
in their behalf again&s;t the Robbers of tho&s;e
Times, obtain'd the Name of <HI>Alexander.</HI> Be|ing
grown up, whether his generous Qualities
betray'd his Birth, or whether it was by his
Mother's Contrivance, who had manag'd the
Secret, he was made known to his Father, and
receiv'd with a great deal of Satisfaction. Soon
after he fail'd into <HI>Greece,</HI> under a Pretence of
demanding his Aunt <HI>He&s;ione,</HI> carry'd away by
<HI>Hercules,</HI> and marry'd to <HI>Telamon</HI> the Father
of <HI>Ajax;</HI> but (as the Event &s;hew'd) with a
De&s;ign upon <HI>Helena,</HI> the Wife of <HI>Menelaus</HI>
King of <HI>Sparta.</HI> Yet 'tis probable, he had no
further Intent than mo&s;t of the young active
Heroes of the&s;e Times, when they went in
Search of foreign Adventures. Such &s;eems to
be his Arrival at <HI>Sparta,</HI> where he was receiv'd
by <HI>Menelaus</HI> with all the Expre&s;&s;ions of Kind|ne&s;s
and Civility. He &s;oon fell in League with
<HI>Helena</HI> his Wife, and carry'd her away with
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rape of</HI> Helen.</NOTE> but (as mo&s;t of the Rapes of Antiquity
were) with her own Con&s;ent. I have men|tion'd
&s;everal old Grudges between the <HI>Greci|ans</HI>
and <HI>A&s;iaticks,</HI> with whom the <HI>Trojans</HI> ge|nerally
&s;ided, as being their Neighb$rs. So
that whatever <HI>Paris</HI>'s Intentions at fir&s;t were
he was certainly glad of this Opportunity of
gratifying his Love, and revenging the Quar|rels
of his Country and Family. For fear of
being purfu'd, he carry'd her fir&s;t to <HI>Sidon</HI> in
<HI>Phenicia,</HI> where &s;ome &s;ay they were marry'd

and from thence to <HI>Troy;</HI> where they were no
&s;ooner arriv'd, but <HI>Sparta</HI> was in an Uproar,
and <HI>Greece</HI> in general immediately took the A|larm.
For <HI>Menelaus</HI> his Re&s;entment was &s;oon
&s;econded by his Brother <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> who bear|ing
the chief Sway in <HI>Pelopomte&s;us,</HI> us'd his ut|mo&s;t
Efforts to engage all the Princes of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and make it a national Quarrel. And one Rea|&s;on
why he &s;ucceeded &s;o ea&s;ily in this De&s;ign
was, that <HI>Helen</HI> being the fam'd <HI>Beauty</HI> of tho&s;e
Times, her Father <HI>Tyndareus</HI> had made it a
Condition to the young Princes who addre&s;s'd
her, that where-ever &s;he &s;hould fix her Choice,
they &s;hould all in general oblige them&s;elves by
Oath, in ca&s;e &s;he were &s;tole, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in her

with their re&s;pective Quota's of Men and
Ships, at <HI>Aulis</HI> a Sea-port of <HI>Baotia,</HI> where
they took an Oath not to return, 'till they had
either recover'd <HI>Helen,</HI> or taken <HI>Troy.</HI> Under
<HI>Agamemnon,</HI> who commanded in chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comman|ders of the</HI> Grecian <HI>Forces.</HI></NOTE> the

of Provi&s;ions to divide their Army; one
part being employ'd in tilling the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;e;</HI>
and another &s;ent for the immediate Relief of the
Camp to &s;cour the Seas; and indeed Piracy in
tho&s;e Days was look'd upon as a lawful kind of
Merchandi&s;e: Others were left to live at Di&s;cre|tion,
by &s;poiling and ravaging the Country.
The&s;e prov'd &s;uch favourable Diver&s;ions to the
<HI>Trojans,</HI> as gave them Time not only to &s;treng|then
their Alliances with their Neighbours in
<HI>Phrygia, Lycia, My&s;ia,</HI> and mo&s;t Parts of the
<HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> but al&s;o to form new ones with fo|reign
Princes, who &s;ent them con&s;iderable Re|inforcements.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> had no more Men
upon the Spot, than would &s;erve to annoy the
Town, and &s;ecure them&s;elves, <HI>Achilles</HI> being
&s;ent with a great Detachment to harra&s;s the
Country, and cut off Provi&s;ions from the
City. Wherein he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he
took twenty three Towns, and in them a great
deal of Booty; upon the Divi&s;ion whereof he was
highly di&s;gu&s;ted, becau&s;e he had taken the great|e&s;t
part of it him&s;elf. He had taken with him
<HI>Palamedes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palamedes.</NOTE> who, as he was carrying on the
War in <HI>Lesbos,</HI> was traduc'd by the fal&s;e Sug|ge&s;tions
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and &s;ton'd in the Camp as
a Traitor. The Truth is, he had de&s;erv'd ve|ry
well of the Army for his Courage, Wi&s;|dom,
and Learning; and the Envy of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
was the chief Grounds of their Quarrel. To
<PB N="43" REF="70">
<HI>palamedes</HI> are a&s;crib'd &s;ixteen Letters of the
<HI>Greek Alphabet,</HI> or rather four, which he ad|ded

as al&s;o the ordering and ranking of an Army,
(tho' this was in a great mea&s;ure owing to <HI>Me|ne&s;theus</HI>)
with the Watch-word, and &s;everal
Sorts of Games to divert the Soldiers. His
Death was highly re&s;ented by the Elder <HI>A|jax,</HI>
and more particularly by <HI>Achilles,</HI> who
for this, and his &s;mall Share in the Booty, would
not in a great while be per&s;uaded to pro&s;ecute
the War; which &s;eems a more probable Cau&s;e
for his Anger, than what the <HI>Poet</HI> a&s;&s;igns of
<HI>Agamemnon's</HI> taking his Mi&s;tre&s;s from him.</P>
<P>To relate all the Particulars of this War would
be tedious, and perhaps not warrantable. For
what the fir&s;t nine Years produc'd, amounted
to no more than Sallies and Skirmi&s;hes, wherein
the Town could not &s;uffer extreamly, being at
fir&s;t well provided with Nece&s;&s;aries, having e|qual
Numbers to pour out upon tho&s;e who were
before it, and a &s;afe Retreat upon any Mi&s;car|riage.
So that mo&s;t agree there was no con|&s;iderable
Action from the fir&s;t Year to the tenth;
and <HI>Herodotus's</HI> Opinion is very probable, that
the <HI>Grecians</HI> did not lye before the Town the
fir&s;t nine Years; but that the <HI>Trojan</HI> Domini|ons
con&s;i&s;ting of nine large Principalities, they
found Employment enough to beat up and down
the Country, &s;poiling and plundering all before
them, 'till at la&s;t they came of cour&s;e to block
up their Capital City; which has que&s;tionle&s;s
introduc'd the Mi&s;take of converting this War,
which la&s;ted in all tenYears, into <HI>Decennial Siege.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain, that in the Beginning of the
Summer in which <HI>Troy</HI> was taken, the <HI>Grecians</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="71">
pre&s;ented them&s;elves in a Body before the Town.
The Be&s;ieg'd were ea&s;ily drawn out, as being
little inferior to them either in Numbers or

to march with his <HI>Myrmidons</HI> to their Re|lief.
By the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e Troops (which
<HI>Achilles</HI> had kept more out of a Pique than for
a Re&s;erve) the <HI>Grecians</HI> rally'd, and after a &s;harp
Engagement repuls'd the <HI>Trojans. Patroclus</HI> had
kill'd <HI>Sarpedon</HI> and others, and was in Pur&s;uit

<P>Whatever <HI>Troy</HI> &s;uffer'd, the <HI>Grecians</HI> had no

<HI>Argives,</HI> who had always expre&s;s'd a &s;trong In|clination
to Liberty, took Occ&s;ion upon his
Death to deprive his Succe&s;&s;ors of all Marks
of Regal Authority, leaving them nothing but
the Title: So that from hence we may proper|ly
date the Fall of the Kingdom of <HI>Argos,</HI> af|ter
it had continu'd together with that of <HI>My|cenae,</HI>
about eight hundred Years, from the be|ginning
of <HI>Inachus.</HI></P>
<P>To avoid the Inconveniences of a &s;udden
Change, there was &s;till a Succe&s;&s;ion of Tit|ular
Kings: But they were &s;o cramp'd in their
Power, that they could act nothing of them|&s;elves;
and therefore we find little Mention
made of them. The la&s;t who bore that Name
was <HI>Meltas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meltas <HI>the la&s;t Titu|lar King.</HI></NOTE> the Son of <HI>Lacidaus;</HI> who being
&s;ome what imperious, and exerting him&s;elf be|yond
his Predece&s;&s;ors, they fir&s;t depriv'd him
of all the Power he had re&s;um'd, and then con|demn'd
him to Death; by which means they
pluck'd up all Supremacy by the Roots, and
&s;uffer'd none afterwards to reign among&s;t them.
For by what <HI>Herodotus</HI> mentions after this of
a King of <HI>Argos,</HI> is meant no more than in the
Common-wealths of <HI>Athens, Carthage and Rome,</HI>
where this Name was apply'd to &s;ome particu|lar
Officers in the State.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argos <HI>a Democra|cy.</HI></NOTE> So that we mu&s;t
from this time look upon <HI>Argos</HI> as a &s;ettled
Common-wealth; tho' as to its Con&s;titution we
<PB N="53" REF="81">
have little more left of the ancient Accounts of
it, than to a&s;&s;ure us it was in the nature of a
<HI>Democracy,</HI> the People being divided into four
<HI>Tribes,</HI> in Subordination to whom they had a
Senate cho&s;en annually, to which belong'd the
Executive Power, but of no further U&s;e, un|le&s;s
to prepare Matters for the whole Body,
with Authority to enact Things of le&s;&s;er Con|&s;equence.
They had al&s;o a Council of State
con&s;i&s;ting of eighty Per&s;ons, be&s;ides judges for
determining of Cau&s;es, with other inferior
Magi&s;trates in the City. In this State the <HI>Argives</HI>
flouri&s;h'd for many Ages, and became famous
for their Conte&s;ts with the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> a|bout
the Territories of <HI>Tbyrae.</HI> But that
which rais'd, or at lea&s;t fomented the&s;e Diffe|rences,
was a &s;ecret Emulation and Di&s;ta&s;te of

This Change put an End to the fir&s;t State

that we can expect little more than
their Names, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons even
they are not always handed down faithfully
to Po&s;terity. But upon the whole we may
allow of this Race of thirteen Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t State of</HI> Lacedae|mon <HI>under thirteen Kings.</HI></NOTE> of which
the three la&s;t were of the <HI>Pelopidae.</HI> They

<PB N="58" REF="86">
hardly po&s;&s;lible to di&s;tingui&s;h 'em enough to
know upon which to fix the Crown. From
hence 'tis probable, their Mother took the Hint
of turning it to the Advantage of both her
Sons; &s;o that when the <HI>Spartans</HI> came to her
to decide the Controvert&s;ie, &s;he pretended not
to know which was the Elder; and the Oracle
at the &s;ame time favouring the Project,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eury&s;the|nes <HI>and</HI> Procles.</NOTE> they
were both declar'd Kings of <HI>Sparta</HI> with equal
Power, but with &s;ome Degree of Preference
in Point of Honour to the Family of <HI>Eury&s;the|nes.</HI>
Their Uncle <HI>Theras</HI> was appointed <HI>Pro|dicus,</HI>
or Protector during their Minority:
And his Regency being expir'd, he planted a
Colony in <HI>Calli&s;te,</HI> an I&s;land in the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea,
better known afterwards from him by the
Name of <HI>Thera.</HI> The Brothers being of Age
began to look upon one another as Rivals in
Empire: And it is not &s;o much a Won|der,
that this &s;hould breed a &s;ecret Di&s;ta&s;te
and Enmiry between 'cm, as that it &s;hould
be propagated down to their late&s;t Po&s;$arity,
and yet never break out for above eight hun|dred
Years, &s;o as to di&s;&s;olve the Con&s;titution.

had done in Favour of the Country, and
impos'd a Tribute. To which all Parts having
&s;ubmitted, except the Inhabitants of <HI>Hclos,</HI>
he made 'em Pri&s;oners of War, took away all the

Pa&s;&s;age of him, that being be&s;ieg'd

Conque&s;ts to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divi&s;ion of their Con|que&s;ts.</HI></NOTE> upon Condition that he

off in the Face of the Enemy, and refus'd to

Order and Beauty, with which they after|wards
appear'd in the World, and which was
owing chiefly to the Care of <HI>Solon,</HI> and Pi&s;i|&s;tratus.
From hence 'tis thought he went in|to
<HI>Aegypt:</HI> But as for his Travels into the
more remote Parts of the World, and his Con|ferences

would lo&s;e no Time: And the Corruption
being Univer&s;al, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to change
the whole Face of the Common-wealth. But
con&s;idering how requi&s;ite a Shew of Religion
is in &s;uch Ca&s;es to gain Credit and Authority,
he went fir&s;t to con&s;ult <HI>Apollo at Delphi,</HI> where
the <HI>Pythia</HI> call'd him, <HI>Beloved of the Gods, and
rather God than Man.</HI> To this famous Ora|cle
he gave the Name of <HI>Rhetra,</HI> pretending
to receive in it the Form of a Common-wealth,
with an A&s;&s;urance, that it &s;hould be the mo&s;t
flouri&s;hing of any in the World. Encourag'd
by &s;uch happy Omens, he broke his De&s;igns
fir&s;t to his particular Friends, and then by de|grees
gain'd others to his Party, 'till Things
being ripe for Action, he order'd thirty of the
principal Men to appear arm'd in the Market|place,
to &s;trike a Terror into tho&s;e who op|pos'd
him. King <HI>Charilaus</HI> was alarm'd, and
took Sanctuary in the Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI>
'till being let into their De&s;igns, and withal of
a flexible Temper, he came out, and join'd in
the Confederacy.</P>
<P>Having made this fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Step, he
began at the Head of the State: And tho' he
continu'd the two Kings with the &s;ame Right
of Succe&s;&s;ion, he made &s;ufficient Abatements
in their Power by in&s;tituting a <HI>Senate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He In&s;ti|tutes a se|nate</HI></NOTE> as a
Counter-poi&s;e between the Prerogative and the
People, their Bu&s;ine&s;s being to adhere to the
weaker Side, 'till they reduc'd Things to an
Equal Ballance. It con&s;i&s;ted of twenty eight
Per&s;ons be&s;ides the Kings, the fir&s;t Choice be|ing
made out of tho&s;e who had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting
$o <HI>Lycurgus</HI> in the Settlement; and after them
were admitted the mo&s;t Eminent for their pri|vate
<PB N="64" REF="93">
Virtue, or their Services to the Publick, but
none under &s;ixty Years of Age. They were
continu'd for Life, except upon any notorious
Mi&s;demeanor: Which as it prevented the Incon|veniences
of too frequent a Change in that
Body, &s;o it was a la&s;ting Reward to the Old
Men, and an Encouragement to the Young.
They were the <HI>Supreme Court of Judicature;</HI>
and tho' there lay an Appeal from them to
the People, we find but few In&s;tances of it
becau&s;e they proceeded with &s;uch Deliberati|on
and Caution, that they often &s;taid &s;everal
Days to see what further Evidence could be
brought on either Side before they pa&s;s'd Sen|tence.
And after all, they were not accounta|ble
for their Determinations; which <HI>Ari&s;lotle</HI>
takes Notice of, as a larger Immunity, than
is con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;t Form of a Common|wealth.
When we con&s;ider further, that they
had in Effect the whole <HI>Executive Power</HI> in
their Hands, it will ea&s;ily appear what Figure
their Kings made, who are to be look'd upon
but as the chief Members of the Senate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By which the power of the kings is limited</HI></NOTE> &s;ince
they had not Authority to decree, or under|take
any thing of Con&s;equence, without a Ma|jority
on their Side. They had indeed &s;ome
particular Re&s;pect and Deference paid to their
Per&s;ons, having the chief Seats in the A&s;&s;em|bly,
giving their Opinion and Vote fir&s;t; and
<HI>Herodotus</HI> in&s;inuates, that they had double
Votes. But as to their particular Offices, they
amounted to little more than the Reception
of Amba&s;&s;adors, and other Strangers, with the
Care of Sacrifices, Oracles, Adoptions, Heire&s;|&s;es,
and the High-ways. They were al&s;o liable
to be call'd to Account for Male-admini&s;trati|on,
<PB N="65" REF="94">
being formally try'd, and condemn'd ac|cording
to the Nature of the Crime, only
with a Re&s;erve, which every private Citizen
had, of appealing to the People. So that upon
the whole, they had a more exten&s;ive Juri&s;di|ction
as Senators, than as Kings: For however
they were &s;ooth'd with the Title, and Shew of
Maje&s;ty, they were in Effect much inferior
to the <HI>Roman Con&s;uls,</HI> and &s;carce &s;o much as
the pre&s;ent <HI>Doges of Venice.</HI> This was their
Condition at Home: But in the Field they
appear'd to a greater Advantage, where, as Ge|nerals
of the Armies, they had a more ab&s;o|lute
Command. They had to attend them a
<HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI> with <HI>Judges</HI> in the na|ture
of <HI>Field-Deputies,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Colonels,</HI> and o|ther
inferior Officers, whom they advis'd with
as their Council, but were free to act as they
thought convenient. Not but they receiv'd
their Orders from the State; which tho' they
were for the mo&s;t part di&s;cretionary, yet were
they &s;ometimes forc'd to march again&s;t an Ene|my,
or to return Home, when they lea&s;t thought of it.</P>
<P>As to the Peoples Share in this new Settle|ment,
they had their <HI>A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> the <HI>Le&s;&s;er</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting
of the Citizens only, and the <HI>Great one</HI>
of the whole Body of the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who
were free of the State. But they were little
more than meer Matter of Form: For the Se|nate
a&s;&s;embled, and di&s;mi&s;s'd them when they pleas'd, and propos'd what they thought con|venient;
which the People had nothing to do
but to rati&s;ie, or reject, having not the Liberty
to propo&s;e, debate, determine, or &s;o much as
to deliver their Opinion. To add to which,
<PB N="66" REF="95">
they were left out of all the Offices in the
State. So that they were very little Gainers
by what the Kings lo&s;t, 'till <HI>Lycurgus</HI> made it up
to'em by his next Task, which &s;eems the mo&s;t
difficult and hazardous of any he undertook;
tho' it was indeed the chief Hinge upon which
his whole Fabrick turn'd. This was his Divi|&s;ion
of the Lands, which had been engro&s;s'd
chiefly by tho&s;e who made their Advantage
of the late trouble&s;ome Times. To the&s;e he
repre&s;ented the Convenience, and Nece&s;&s;ity of
having no Inequality or Di&s;tinction among&s;t
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Di|vi&s;ion of Lands</HI></NOTE>. but what Vice and Virtue made; and
having the poor, and indigent, which were the
Gro&s;s of the People, on his Side, prevail'd with
'em to renounce their Properties. Then taking
an exact Survey of all <HI>Laconia,</HI> he divided it
into thirty thou&s;and equal Shares, allotting nine
thou&s;and to the City in Proportion to the In|habitants,
and the re&s;t to the Country. Each
Portion was &s;ufficient to maintain a Family in
that &s;rugal manner he propos'd: And tho' the
Kings had a larger Share a&s;&s;ign'd 'em to &s;up|port
their Dignity, yet their Tables had ra|ther
an air of Decency and Competency, than
of Superfluity and Luxury.</P>
<P>But the Mony &s;till lying unequally di&s;pers'd,
and the Law-giver con&s;idering, that mu&s;t of
Cour&s;e bring the Lands again into few Hands,
forbid the U&s;e of Gold and Silver,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gold and Silver pro|hibited</HI></NOTE> in&s;tituting
Iron Mony in the room of it. Which being
current only at Home, and a great Quantity re|quir'd
to make up a little Sum, this brought
Mony into &s;uch Di&s;u&s;e, that few troubled them|&s;elves
with more than to &s;upply their common
Nece&s;&s;ities: And &s;o by Con&s;equence he ba|ni&s;h'd
<PB N="67" REF="96">
Avarice, Rapine and Luxury, with their
long Train of Attendants: And the Rea&s;on
why we meet with &s;o few Courts of Judica|ture
in <HI>Sparta,</HI> is, that by this Means he took
away all Occa&s;ion of Law-Suits. This Project
was laugh'd at by the other <HI>Grecians,</HI> as ha|ving
cut off all Trade, and Merchandi&s;e: But
<HI>Lycurgus</HI> had his Aim in it, &s;ince it &s;erv'd not
only to &s;uppre&s;s all Trades and Arts at Home,
which tended to Effeminacy and Exce&s;s, but
al&s;o prevented the Importation of <HI>Foreign Va|nities;</HI>
and kept another Law in Force, which
he made expre&s;ly again&s;t the Continuance of
Strangers in the City, for fear of their corrupt|ing
the People, and breaking in upon his Con|&s;titution.
And it was for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons,
that he would not permit his own People to
Travel.</P>
<P>His next Ordinance was levelld again&s;t pri|vate
Luxury, that the Men &s;hould not eat at
Home with their Families, but in one Com|mon
Hall without Di&s;tinction of Dignity, or
Fortune. The&s;e Meetings were at fir&s;t call'd
<HI>Andria,</HI> (the Name the <HI>Cretans</HI> us'd, from whom
the Cu&s;tom was deriv'd) afterwards <HI>Phiditia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Phi$|ditia.</NOTE>
and <HI>Sy&s;&s;itia.</HI> Every one &s;ent his Provi&s;ions
in monthly, with a little Mony for other Con|tingencies:
But all &s;uch Things were forbid,
which tended rather to pamper than nouri&s;h,
one of their chief Di&s;hes being the famous
<HI>Spartan</HI> Broth, which was black, and not very
palatable to tho&s;e who were not us'd to it.
This Way of Supping in Common was at fir&s;t
&s;o &s;trongly oppos'd, that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was in&s;ulted
about it, but when e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Cu&s;tom, it was
&s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, and the Children were &s;ent
<PB N="68" REF="97">
to the&s;e Tables, as to Schools of Temperance,
and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Lycurgus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spar|tan Edu|cation.</NOTE> by this Regulation of the State, in|tended
that of Manners, as the only Means to
&s;upport it, not thinking any one could make a
good Citizen, who was not fir&s;t a good Man,
And as their Morals depended chiefly on E|ducation,
he took Care to in&s;till &s;uch early
Principles, that they &s;hould in a manner be
born with a Sen&s;e of Order and Di&s;cipline.
To this End he began from the very Time of
their Conception, making it the Mother's In|tere&s;t
to u&s;e &s;uch Diet and Exerci&s;e, that &s;he
might produce Children of a robu&s;t, vigorous,
and hardy Con&s;titution. For if the Infant, up|on
a publick View at its Birth, was judged to
be &s;o deform'd, or weak, that it would prove
rather a Burden, than a Benefit to it's Coun|try,
it was barbarou&s;ly expos'd to peri&s;h in a
Cavern near Mount <HI>Taygetus.</HI> Tho&s;e who
were free from the&s;e Defects, were deliver'd
back to their Parents, and nurs'd with Hard|&s;hip,
and Severity in Diet, Cloaths, and every
thing el&s;e, beyond what one would imagine
Boys of that Age were capable of Bearing.</P>
<P>At &s;even Years old their Parents had in a
manner done with them: For they were then
reckon'd Children of the Publick, and accord|ingly
a&s;&s;ign'd over into <HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI> or Companies,
in which one more forward and experienc'd
than the re&s;t pre&s;ided as Captain, to govern and
cha&s;ti&s;e them, as he thought they de&s;erv'd.
For their very Sports and Exerci&s;es were re|gulated
according to the exacte&s;t Di&s;cipline,
and made up of Labour and Fatigue. They
went bare-foot, with their Heads &s;hav'd, and
<PB N="69" REF="98">
fought with one another naked: And there
was a yearly Cu&s;tom of whipping them at the
Altar of <HI>Diana Taurica,</HI> which they would
bear patiently 'till the Blood ran, and &s;ometimes
with a &s;trange &s;ort of Emulation, 'till they
dy'd upon the &s;pot. <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells a Story of
a Boy, who having &s;tole a Fox, and hid it
under his Coat, cho&s;e rather to let it tear out
his very Bowels, than di&s;cover the The&s;t. For
Stealing with them was lawful, and encourag'd
as a piece of Military Exerci&s;e, but puni&s;hable
if found out.</P>
<P>At twelve Years old they were remov'd in|to
other <HI>Companies</HI> of the &s;ame Nature: Where,
in order to cru&s;h the Seeds of Vice, which
began at that Time to di&s;play them&s;elves, their
Labour and Di&s;cipline were encreas'd with
their Age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pae|donomus.</NOTE> Here they had their <HI>Padonomus,</HI>
who was the general In&s;petor into their Be|haviour
and under him the <HI>Irens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Irens.</NOTE> young Men
&s;elected out of their own Body, one allotred
to each Company, to exerci&s;e a more con&s;tant
and immediate Command over them. Being
now arriv'd to a more Manly and Martial &s;ort
of Exerci&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The peo|ples Share in the Go|vernment</HI></NOTE> they had their Skirmi&s;hes between
Parties, and their Mock-fights, or rather real
Engagements of greater Bodies: Of which
the mo&s;t eminent were the <HI>Platani&s;ta,</HI> (&s;o call'd
from the Place being &s;et with Plane-Trees)
where they fought with Hands, Feet, Teeth
and Nails and with &s;uch Courage and Ob&s;ti|nacy,
that it was common with 'em to lo&s;e
their Eyes, Limbs, and &s;ometimes their Lives,
Before the Bu&s;ine&s;s was decided. Then as to
the politick Part, they had their Watches,
Guards, Ambu&s;cades, with other Wiles and
<PB N="70" REF="99">
Stratagems of War, to give them a Notion
of what they were afterwards to do in the
Field.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o due Care taken for the Im|provement
of their Minds: But as their chief
Bu&s;ine&s;s was Action and Obedience, a mode|rate
degree of Learning was thought &s;ufficient;
and they receiv'd their In&s;tructions rather from
Men than Books. To this End the grave&s;t
Citizens took a Plea&s;ure in examining them, to
try the Pregnancy of their Parts: And the
<HI>Irens</HI> at Supper made 'em propo&s;e to one ano|ther
variety of Que&s;tions, to which they were
to give ready, clear, and &s;hort An&s;wers. Which
being improv'd into an Habit, it taught'em
a natural and graceful way of &s;peaking, and
furni&s;h'd 'em with &s;uch a Pre&s;ence of Mind,
and Quickne&s;s of Thought, that they gave
very &s;urpri&s;ing Turns to things, either by way
of Repartee, or Apothegm, as the Subject
would bear.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Origi|nal of the</HI> Laconick <HI>Stile,</HI></NOTE> This was the Foundation of
that pithy Stile, which they afterwards re|tain'd,
and was di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of
the <HI>Laconick,</HI> being recommended by <HI>Lycurgus</HI>
upon this Principle, <HI>That few Laws would
&s;erve tho&s;e, who us'd but few Words.</HI> And tho'
the <HI>Spartans</HI> were no Friends to Oratory, they
were ob&s;erv'd to deliver them&s;elves as hand|&s;omely,
and generally more to the purpo&s;e, than
tho&s;e who had gone through a formal cour&s;e
of Study, and us'd a long train of Arguments.
For this conci&s;e manner of expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves,
detracted nothing from the Strength of
their Thoughts, but rather gave them a greater
Energy. It was an in&s;tructive Brevity; and
its Beauty was, that there was more imply'd
<PB N="71" REF="100">
than expre&s;s'd. Such was the con&s;tant &s;trict
Di&s;cipline they under-went during their Mi|nority,
which we may conclude la&s;ted 'till
they were thirty Years of Age, &s;ince they
could not before that time marry, go into the
Army, or bear any Office in the State: And
if they did not marry &s;oon after that Form,
they were publickly di&s;grac'd.</P>
<P>The Rules for the Education of Virgins
were much of the &s;ame Stamp with that of
the Boys, with very little Regard to the natural
Softne&s;s of the Sex. They were inur'd to a
con&s;tant cour&s;e of Labour and Indu&s;try 'till
they were twenty Years old, before which time
they were not allow'd to be marriageable.
They had al&s;o their Exerci&s;es of Running,
Wre&s;tling, Darting, and Throwing the Bar;
mo&s;t of which they perform'd naked and in
publick: And yet this was thought &s;o far from
contributing to Vice, or Immode&s;ty, that it
was de&s;ign'd as a Guard to Virtue, by appear|ing
with &s;uch native Innocence and Simplicity.
Their excelling in the&s;e Feats of Activity
&s;eems to have been the Foundation of that
Sen&s;e of Honour, and Greatne&s;s of
Spirit, of which the <HI>Spartan</HI> Women were Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es;
and of which there is a notable In&s;tance in
<HI>Gorgo,</HI> the Wife of King <HI>Leonidas,</HI> who was
told in Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Foreign Ladies,
<HI>That the Women of</HI> Lacedaemon <HI>were they only
of the World, who had an Empire over the Men;</HI>
to which &s;he briskly reply'd, <HI>There was good
Rea&s;on for it; for they were the only Women who
brought forth Men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Adultery allowe'd of.</NOTE> In &s;peaking of the Wo|men,
it is ob&s;ervable, that among other Provi|&s;ions
for Marriage, there was no Law again&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="101">
Adultery; and the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd for it, is,
that there was no &s;uch thing ever heard of in
<HI>Sparta.</HI> But this looks like an Equivocation:
For whatever Name they gave it, the Thing
was certainly practis'd, and in a manner au|thoriz'd.
It was by way of Borrowing and
Exchanging with their Neighbours for a Time
by Con&s;ent: So that if a Woman lik'd another
Man better than her Husband, the Pretence
was always at hand, to mend the Breed, with|out
the Inconveniences of a Divorce. The
Ca&s;e was much the &s;ame on the Man's &s;ide:
And one Rea&s;on of allowing this mutual Li|berty,
was not &s;o much to gratifie Lu&s;t, as to
remove &s;o fruitle&s;s and racking a Pain, as that
of Jealou&s;ie. The&s;e were the Methods <HI>Lycur|gus</HI>
took for the training up of Youth, and making early and
deep Impre&s;&s;ions of Virtue.
He knew how near Cu&s;tom and Education ap|proach'd
to Nature; and therefore it was from
thence only, that he promis'd to him&s;elf a la&s;t|ing
Settlement of the State. Which &s;eems to
have been the chief Rea&s;on, why he would
never reduce his Laws to Writing.</P>
<P>He laid down other general Maxims,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Mi|&s;cellany Laws.</NOTE> in the
Nature of Laws: As that they &s;hould not of|ten
make War upon the &s;ame Enemies, for fear
of learning them their Di&s;cipline, 'till in Time
they came to be the Aggre&s;&s;ors. Another
was, that the City &s;hould not be wall'd, &s;ay|ing,
<HI>He would have a Wall of Men in&s;tead of
Brick:</HI> And indeed their Way of Di&s;cipline
kept them &s;o con&s;tantly on their Guard, and &s;o
in a Body, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ibly for
them to be &s;urpris'd; the Tilling of the
Grounds, and all other &s;ervile Drudgery, being
<PB N="73" REF="102">
left to the <HI>Helots.</HI> It was not lawful to &s;ell
any of the&s;e Slaves into Foreign Countries, or
to make 'em Free: So that their continual En|crea&s;e
gave Umbrage to the State, and occa|&s;ion'd
the <HI>Cryptia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cryp|tia.</NOTE> or <HI>Secret Act;</HI> by which it
was order'd, that &s;everal Companies of young
Men &s;hould now and then be di&s;patch'd into
the Country, who lying conceal'd all Day in
the Thickets, were to ru&s;h out upon 'em in
the Night, and kill all they could lay their
Hands on. This is generally a&s;crib'd to <HI>Ly|curgus;</HI>
tho' <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, he was of too mild
a Di&s;po&s;ition to authorize &s;uch a Barbarity.
And indeed it &s;eems more probable, that this
Ordinance was of a later Date in the Time of
the <HI>Ephori,</HI> who proclaim'd War again&s;t 'em.
But 'tis certain, that at this Time they were
us'd more like Bea&s;ts than Men of the &s;ame
Society, being often made drunk, and carry'd
into their publick Halls to expo&s;e Vice. This
&s;evere Treatment of 'em occa&s;ion'd a Saying,
that, <HI>He who was Free in</HI> Sparta, <HI>was mo&s;t &s;o
and a Slave there, was the greate&s;t Slave in the
World.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Form of the Common-wealth
in&s;tituted by <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> wherein his Succe&s;s an|&s;wer'd,
or rather exceeded his very Wi&s;hes.
For it cannot ea&s;ily be imagin'd, how &s;o &s;ud|den
and univer&s;al a Change could be wrought
by one who had nothing but his &s;ingle Virtue
to oppo&s;e again&s;t two Kings in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Throne. Nor is it le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, that a <HI>Pa|gan,</HI>

be&s;t appear by taking a &s;hort Survey of the
Whole, with the general Advantages that ac|cru'd
by it. Things being put upon &s;o equal
a Foot, there was no Matter left for private
Debates and Ammo&s;ities: Every Member of
the State had nothing to do but to attend the
Publick; and as they con&s;pir'd to the general
Good, they found their own in it. In lieu of
their Mony, which they had parted with, they
were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of more inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ures:
And of all their Wealth, nothing was e&s;teem'd
more precious than their Time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">With a &s;hort Sur|vey of the New Set|tlement.</NOTE> They had
their con&s;tant Employments &s;uited to all Ages,

Labour as ba&s;e and &s;ervile, that they em|brac'd
it as the Occupation of a Man &s;incerely
free. This Love of it interdicted all Plays even
to Children; and the Soldier was not &s;uffer'd
to walk at his lei&s;ure Hours. In &s;hort, every
Moment was devoted to Virtue; and it was a
&s;ort of Sacrilege to let the lea&s;t Particle of it
&s;lip by unemploy'd. They were good Hus|bands
even of their Words; &s;o that a &s;ingle
Syllable often &s;erv'd for an An&s;wer to the mo&s;t
important Di&s;patches. Some of their Neigh|bours
having &s;ent 'em a threatning Me&s;&s;age,
<HI>That if they got into their Country, they would
put all to Fire and Sword,</HI> they return'd An|&s;wer,
<HI>If.</HI> Their very Silence was expre&s;&s;ive
and emphatical. They ob&s;erv'd the &s;tricte&s;t
Rules of Temperance; &s;o that Wine was &s;eldom
us'd among them, and a Wheaten Loaf was
reckon'd among their Dainties. There was no
&s;uch thing as Splendor or Magnificence in
<PB N="75" REF="104">
<HI>Sparta.</HI> To go differently cloath'd, according
to the Sea&s;ons of the Year, was there look'd
on as a criminal Effeminacy: Even the Sex
that is mo&s;t curious in the ornamental Part,
&s;tudied only that of the Mind. They &s;acrific'd
all &s;orts of Luxury to the Liberty of the Mind;
and conceiv'd as great an Aver&s;ion to Sloth
and Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, as we naturally have to
Pain and Grief. For this and other prevailing
Rea&s;ons, the Diver&s;ions of the Theatre were
not privileg'd, le&s;t they &s;hould accu&s;tom their
Eyes to behold the Repre&s;entation of what
was condemn'd by their Law, or their Ears
to be polluted with the Apology of guilty
Pa&s;&s;ions. The Law rul'd with an equal Au|thority
over the Rich and the Poor: Their
Kings valu'd them&s;elves upon their Subjection
to it, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves only by a
&s;tricter Obedience. Merit appear'd in every
Age and Sex. Youth had no need to wait for
the Le&s;&s;ons of Experience, which were &s;up|ply'd
by In&s;titution and Example; whereby
Women became capable of the mo&s;t elevated
Virtues. The Love of their Country &s;ilenc'd
all maternal Softne&s;s, and made the Mother,
when &s;he heard her Son was &s;lain in the Ser|vice
of the Publick, regulate her Grief, accord|ing
as the Wounds he receiv'd, were &s;hameful,
or honourable. After the &s;trict Di&s;cipline they
had undergone at Home, they met with no|thing
terrible in the Field; and were <HI>The only
People in the World, to whom War gave Repo&s;e.</HI>
From hence it was, that they proceeded with
a well-grounded deliberate Valour to an En|gagement,
and propos'd no End of it, but
Death, or Victory. The Reputation of &s;o
<PB N="76" REF="105">
extraordinary a Merit prevail'd with the Kings
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>Phaenicia</HI> to pay a &s;ort of Homage
to them, and te&s;tifie their Submi&s;&s;ion in mo&s;t
&s;olemn Emba&s;&s;ies. Nor were the <HI>Grecians</HI> them|&s;elves
le&s;s &s;truck with E&s;teem and Reverence
for them, being per&s;uaded that to attend them,
was to follow Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on, and to pur&s;ue
their own Honour and Intere&s;t. For Tyranny met in <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> with mo&s;t terrible and impla|cable
Enemies; Liberty, faithful and indefati|gable
Protectors. By this means <HI>Sparta</HI> exer|cis'd
that Empire over the other States of
<HI>Greece,</HI> which her Virtue had given her: And
&s;o long as the govern'd by that Title, was re|verenced
as the <HI>Mother of Nations, Protectre&s;s
of the Common Cau&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Supream Judge of all
Differences.</HI> For all which she neither receiv'd,
nor exacted any other Tribute, than that of
E&s;teem, Love, Tru&s;t and Admiration.</P>
<P>Her Con&s;titution however was not without
its Faults.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defects in the <HI>Spartan</HI> Con&s;tituti|on.</NOTE> I have mention'd &s;ome notorious
ones as to the Moral Part: And the Govern|ment
in general carry'd &s;uch an Air of Hror
with it, that it was rather admir'd, than imita|ted.
Their &s;trict Di&s;cipline was harden'd into
a Moro&s;ene&s;s of Tempe$; &s;o that they knew not
how to abate of their Rigour upon Occa&s;ion,
but extended the &s;ame har&s;h Severity to their
Allies, which they us'd towards one another.
Be&s;ides, there was no Peace, nor Truce ob|&s;erv'd
in a Common-wealth devoted to Arms,
and who&s;e very Con&s;titution was War. This
by degrees made their Government di&s;ta&s;teful;
and favour'd the Ambition of the <HI>Athenians</HI>
their Rivals, and indeed their Rever&s;e: Who
had liv'd a great while without any Thoughts
<PB N="77" REF="106">
of Command; but at la&s;t exerted them&s;elves,
(as will appear by the Sequel of the Story) and
drew both their own, and their Neighbours

his Scheme, and found the Common-wealth

a voluntary Exile; and perhaps it was not
known where, le&s;t being tran&s;ported back to
<HI>Sparta</HI> either alive or dead, the People &s;hould
make it a Pretence of freeing them&s;elves from
their Oath, and cancel his Laws. But they
bore no le&s;s Re&s;pect to his Memory, than to
his Per&s;on: They built a Temple, and paid
Divine Honours to him; and yet <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> thinks
it was le&s;s than he de&s;erved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> He was certainly
a Per&s;on of exqui&s;ite Ju&s;tice and Moderation, as

could refu&s;e one, when it was in a manner
forc'd upon him; and who run a greater Ri&s;que
by declining the Offer, than he would have
done by accepting it. He was not more re|markable
in the Invention of his Laws, than in
recommending them by his Example; &s;ince he
ordain'd nothing to oblige others, which he did
not punctually ob&s;erve him&s;elf. And that he

<P>With this Settlement by <HI>Lycurgus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of &s;econd state of</HI> Lacedae|mon.</NOTE> we may

concern'd in, either as chief Officers of the

have brought the <HI>Spartan</HI> Story down to this Pe|riod,
it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute it a little
further, &s;o as to take into our Account the
<HI>Me&s;&s;enian</HI> War; which being the chief Action
of Note between the <HI>Trojan</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars,
requires &s;omewhat of a di&s;tinct Relation; but
had too little Dependance upon the other Af|fairs

falls more properly under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ide|ration
of <HI>Sparta,</HI> as a &s;eparate State.</P>
<P>IV. The <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> &s;oon after the Death
of their Law-giver, grew impatient for Action;
and renewing the War formerly begun with the
<HI>Argives</HI> about their Confines, King <HI>Charilaus</HI>
enter'd their Country with Fire and Sword.
Some few Years after, they fell upon the <HI>Te|geata</HI>
of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> who also border'd upon 'em,
<PB N="79" REF="108">
grounding their Confidence of Succe&s;s upon
the Oracle, which had told 'em they should
mea&s;ure the <HI>Arcadian</HI> Ground with a <HI>Rope.</HI> Ac|cordingly
they took their Ropes with 'em,
with which they fancy'd they were to bind
their Enemies as they took them. But they
were &s;hamefully deluded in their Interpretati|on:
For the <HI>Tegeatae,</HI> both Men and Women, op|pos'd
and routed them, took many of them Pri|&s;oners,
and bound 'em with their own Ropes.
<HI>Charilaus</HI> was al&s;o taken, but &s;oon releas'd upon
his Oath never to fight more again&s;t 'em. Yet
he had after this an Hand in the De&s;truction of
Aegys, and other neighbouring Cities belonging
to the <HI>Achaeans,</HI> which were thought to &s;ide
with the <HI>Tegeatae.</HI></P>
<P>The Collegue of <HI>Charilaus</HI> for &s;ome Time
was <HI>Teleclus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> who&s;e
Death happen'd thus. There was a Temple of
<HI>Diana</HI> frequented by the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> and
<HI>Me&s;&s;enians,</HI> as &s;tanding upon their Borders, and
in common to Both. The <HI>Me&s;&s;enians</HI> attempted
the Cha&s;tity of &s;ome <HI>Spartan</HI> Virgins who were
there attending the Solemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Teleclus.</NOTE> and kill'd <HI>Tele|clus,</HI>
who interpos'd in their Defence. The
<HI>Me&s;&s;enians</HI> give it a quite different Turn, and
&s;ay it was a Plot of <HI>Teleclus</HI> to &s;urpri&s;e them;
that they di&s;cover'd the&s;e Virgins to be young
Men thus di&s;guis'd with Daggers under their
Cloaths, and therefore di&s;patch'd both them and
their Incendiary. 'Tis certain <HI>Tele|clus</HI>
was kill'd in the Tumult; and what makes it look
like Treachery on the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> &s;ide, is,
that the Thing was pre&s;ently hu&s;h'd up with|out
endeavouring to revenge his Death: How|ever
this was afterwards con&s;ider'd as one remote

which latter kept on Foot his Father's Quarrel

into their Country. It was al&s;o in the four

was celebrated: Of which In&s;titution we &s;hall

only apply it here as a Date to the principal
Events.</P>
<P>To <HI>Nicander</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Theopompus;</HI> to who&s;e

or with what De&s;ign. But <HI>Theopompus</HI> him|&s;elf
&s;eems to have been con&s;enting, or rather in|&s;trumental
in the In&s;titution of this Office;
and 'tis &s;aid <HI>Elatus</HI> first exercis'd it by his Ap|pointment.
However, he propos'd them as a
Curb to the Citizens: And being reproach'd by
by his Queen, that <HI>He would leave the Royal
Authority weaker than he found it,</HI> he told her,
<HI>He should leave it more lasting, and by Conse|quence
more solid.</HI> Some will have 'em de&s;ign'd
as A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and others as a Bridle to the
Kings: But <HI>Lycurgus</HI> had left them &s;o &s;mall a
Share of the Admini&s;tration, that the <HI>Ephori</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="110">
could not be of much U&s;e in either of the&s;e
Capacities. 'Tis mo&s;t probable that the Se|nate
had in the Cour&s;e of an hundred Years ex|tended
its Power, and bore too hard upon
the People; who not being &s;atisfy'd with the
Change of obeying thirty Ma&s;ters in&s;tead of
two, procur'd the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e
Officers, who were to repre&s;ent things on their
Behalf, &s;o as to cultivate and maintain a good
Under&s;tanding between them, and the Regen|cy.
The Rea&s;on of a&s;&s;igning them &s;o many
different Offices, is, becau&s;e they were im|ploy'd
as <HI>In&s;pectors,</HI> to inquire into the Conduct
both of the Magi&s;tracy, and the People. But
they were chiefly to protect the Liberties of
the People; who therefore cho&s;e them out of
their own Body, without Di&s;tinction of Birth,
or Fortune, it being a &s;ufficient Qualification,
that they were bold, and popular, and aver&s;e to
arbitrary Proceedings. However moderate
their Power at fir&s;t was, in Proce&s;s of Time it
was &s;o enlarg'd, that Affairs of the la&s;t Con&s;e|quence
pa&s;s'd through their Hands, all the Ma|gi&s;trates
in general, and the Kings them&s;elves
being accountable to them. By which Means
they &s;eem'd to have erected a &s;ort of Tyranny,
which threaten'd greater Di&s;orders, than tho&s;e
they were de&s;ign'd to remedy. But they had
al&s;o their Curbs: The Kings and they took a
mutual Oath every Month; the fir&s;t in their
own Names, to rule according to the Laws, and
the latter in the Name of the People, to pre|&s;erve
their Authority to 'em &s;afe and intire.
For which Rea&s;on the <HI>Ephori</HI> thought them|&s;elves
oblig'd in all pre&s;&s;ing Conjunctures to
make the People agree to what had been before
<PB N="82" REF="111">
judg'd requi&s;ite for the common Intere&s;t. And
as there were five of them, (the fir&s;t of which
was call'd <HI>Eponymns,</HI> upon the &s;ame Account as
the <HI>Archon</HI> at <HI>Athens</HI>) one was an Awe upon
another; and nothing could be done without
the Con&s;ent of the Whole, or at lea&s;t of a Ma|jority.
But the greate&s;t Security to the State
was, that they were cho&s;en annually. With
the&s;e Re&s;trictions, they &s;erv'd as a <HI>Cement</HI> to
join the &s;everal Orders of the State, and were
therefore call'd, <HI>The Nerves of the Common|wealth.</HI>
The Balance was held for the mo&s;t
part &s;o equal, that the &s;upream Authority did
not degenerate into Fiercene&s;s and Tyranny,
nor popular Liberty &s;tart out into Licenciou&s;|ne&s;s
and Rebellion: And it is imputed to this
<HI>Medium</HI> betwixt an exce&s;&s;ive Subjection, and
an exce&s;&s;ive Freedom, that <HI>Sparta</HI> was &s;o long
pre&s;erv'd from tho&s;e dome&s;tick Di&s;&s;entions,
which hara&s;s'd her Neighbours.</P>
<P>Whatever Conce&s;&s;ions <HI>Theopompus</HI> had made

V. It was al&s;o in <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Grounds of the first</HI> Me&s;&s;enian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE>
that the fir&s;t <HI>Me&s;&s;enian</HI> War broke out; to

on an old hereditary Pique between the

Stratagem; which being the be&s;t Country,
they thought they had too much Merit on their
Side, to leave them in a quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
There being &s;o much Rancour and Ambition
at the bottom, every trivial Accident &s;erv'd to
widen the Breach, 'till it came to an open Rup|ture.
Such was that which is recorded as the
more immediate Cau&s;e of this War. <HI>Poly|chares</HI>
a <HI>Me&s;&s;enian</HI> who had won the Prize in
the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, let out &s;ome Cows to Pa|&s;ture
to <HI>Euaephnus</HI> a <HI>Lacedaemonian,</HI> who was
to pay him&s;elf for their keeping with a Share
of the Encrea&s;e. <HI>Euaephnus</HI> &s;old the Cows, pre|tending
they were &s;tole from him: And being
afterwards found out, kill'd <HI>Polychares</HI>'s Son,
who was &s;ent to demand the Mony for 'em.
<HI>Polychares</HI> had often made his Complaint at
<HI>Sparta,</HI> and demanded Ju&s;tice; 'till finding he
was &s;till put off without any Hopes of Redre&s;s, he
grew &s;o incens'd, that he kill'd all the <HI>Lacedaemo|nians</HI>
he could lay his Hands on. Then the <HI>Lace|daemonians</HI>
their Turn remon&s;trated at, <HI>Me&s;&s;enein</HI>

up, it became a national Quarrel: Tho' it &s;till
look'd faire&s;t on the <HI>Me&s;&s;enians</HI> Side, who of|fer'd

time made &s;ecret Provi&s;ions for the War, ob|liging

<P>Accordingly in the &s;econd Year of the ninth
<HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It broke out.</NOTE> they &s;et out by Night under the

all to the Sword; and having left a Guard in

Army down to the Borders to offer 'em Battel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Battel fought with equal Suc|ce&s;s.</NOTE>
which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> accepted, and fought

the Advantage which the <HI>Spartans</HI> had as well

<HI>Joca&s;ta,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Menaeceus,</HI> and had
by her a Son, by whom, the Oracle told him,
he &s;hould be kill'd. To prevent which, he
expos'd the Child in the Woods, having fir&s;t
bor'd Holes in his Feet to fetter him, which
occa&s;ion'd &s;uch a Swelling, that from thence
he afterwards had the Name of <HI>Oedipus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oedipus.</NOTE> be|ing
pre&s;erv'd by the Shepherds, and brought

had a mind to inform him&s;elf concerning his

le&s;s inqui&s;itive to know what was become of
his Son. Accordingly they &s;et out at the

<HI>Aenigma,</HI> propos'd, was to tell, <HI>What it was,

Oedipus</HI> interpreted it, <HI>Of a Man, who in his

according to Agreement he marry'd <HI>Joca&s;ta,</HI>
and obtain'd the Kingdom, being &s;till in a profound

<P>But the Death of <HI>Oedipus</HI> was far from put|ting

of any Moment, that happen'd in <HI>Greece,</HI> being
about thirty Years before that of <HI>Troy;</HI> and is
look'd upon but as a Prelude to it. Tho' as it

publi&s;h'd twenty four Books only of the Prepa|rations
of this Siege, it &s;eems to have made a
greater Noi&s;e in the World, than through &s;uch
a va&s;t Di&s;tance of Time we are &s;en&s;ible of.
The Army was chiefly rais'd by <HI>Adra&s;tus;</HI>
but the other Confederates brought in their Quota's,
and the chief Command was a&s;&s;ign'd
to <HI>Amphiaraus,</HI> who had marry'd <HI>Adra&s;tus</HI>'s
Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>In this Infancy of War, we have no warran|table
Accounts of any thing like a regular Siege.
But the Captains being arriv'd at <HI>Thebes,</HI> di|&s;pos'd
them&s;elves with the Companies under
their Command to attack the &s;even Gates of the
City: Which being guarded by as many Offi|cers
within, the <HI>Thebans</HI> made a Sally, and were
beat back to the Walls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capaneus <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE> which <HI>Capaneus</HI> moun|ted
by a &s;ort of Scaling-ladder, but was beat
<PB N="110" REF="139">
down with Stones by the be&s;ieg'd, and kill'd;
and this undoubtedly gave ri&s;e to the Story of
his being &s;truck dead with Thunderbolts.
Upon this ill Succe&s;s of <HI>Capaneus,</HI> the re&s;t re|treated,
and many of 'em were &s;lain in the Pur|&s;uit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eteocles <HI>and</HI> Polyni|ces <HI>kill each other.</HI></NOTE>
After this, the two Brothers agreed to
decide the Quarrel in their own Per&s;ons; and
fought &s;o ob&s;tinately, that they were both
mortally wounded; whereupon a general En|gagement
was renew'd, wherein the <HI>Argives</HI>
were intirely defeated, with the Lo&s;s of all their
Captains, but <HI>Adra&s;tus,</HI> who &s;av'd him&s;elf by
Flight. Not but the <HI>Thebans</HI> had &s;uffer'd very
much in the Battel, and paid &s;o dear for their
Conque&s;t, that a <HI>Cadmean Victory</HI> became a
Proverb.</P>
<P>Upon the Death of the two Brothers, <HI>Creon</HI>
again u&s;urp'd the Throne, tho' it was under a
Pretence of Guardian&s;hip to <HI>Leodamas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leodamas</NOTE> the Son

were chiefly noted for their Humanity, came
at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Adra&s;tus</HI> with an Army, and
did it by Force. It favour'd &s;o much of Bar|barity,
to &s;uffer any ill Treatment to the dead
Bodies of their Enemies, that it became a &s;tan|ding
Law of Arms to inter them. Which na|tural
Cu&s;tom, tho' it was at fir&s;t. taken up out
of Decency, was afterwards improv'd into Su|per&s;tition;
for it became an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Opi|nion,
that the Souls of tho&s;e who were unbu|ry'd
wander'd about, and could not gain Ad|mittance
into <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI></P>
<P>As to what further concerns the War,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War renew'd.</HI></NOTE> the
Quarrel which &s;eem'd to be at an End, was in

<P>I. FROM the fir&s;t peopling of <HI>Attica,</HI> '$word$
the Time of King <HI>Ogyges,</HI> we have no

indeed &s;ays the <HI>Athenian</HI> Power and Glory was
very great in tho&s;e Days; that tho&s;e early In|habitants
were excellently skill'd both in civil
and military Affairs, were gover'd by ju&s;t and
whole&s;ome Laws, and liv'd in far greater Splen|dor,
than they had arriv'd to in his Time.
But he mentions this only as a general Tradi|tion;
and there $ot being the lea&s;t Foot&s;teps of

There are al&s;o &s;everal Kings mention'd as
reigning in <HI>Attica,</HI> between the Time of <HI>Ogyges</HI>
and <HI>Cecrops,</HI> with &s;ome Particulars recorded of
them; as that from <HI>Actaeus,</HI> one of them,
&s;ome will have <HI>Attica</HI> to have been formerly
call'd <HI>Acte.</HI> But they are rejected by very an|cient
Hi&s;torians; and the mo&s;t warrantable way
of accounting for that Interval, is, that <HI>Attica</HI>
was &s;o much wa&s;ted by the <HI>Ogygian Deluge,</HI>
and its Inhabitants reduc'd to &s;o &s;mall a Num|ber,
that they liv'd an hundred and ninety
Years, from <HI>Ogyges</HI> to <HI>Cecrops</HI> without any
King at all.</P>
<P>To <HI>Cecrops</HI> therefore we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the

planted by the <HI>Saitae,</HI> who came with him
from one of the Mouths of <HI>Nile.</HI> He is the
fir&s;t recorded to have cro&s;s'd the Sea, and &s;et|tled
in <HI>Greece:</HI> But as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had at
that time little or no Knowledge of Sea-Affairs,
it &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that he came immedi|ately
from <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> which was more commo|diou&s;ly
&s;eated for the Improvement of Naviga|tion.
But as yet the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> them&s;elves

his Name of <HI>Diphyes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Name of</HI> Diphyes.</NOTE> as con&s;i&s;ting of two Forms,
Serpentine and Human: But the mo&s;t probable
<PB N="114" REF="144">
is, that he was born in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and reign'd in
<HI>Greece,</HI> and was acquainted with the Langu|age,
and Customs of both Countries. The
People of <HI>Attica,</HI> who lay di&s;pers'd according

he collected into twelve Towns, (tho' &s;ome
a&s;cribe this to the &s;econd <HI>Cecrops</HI>) con&s;tituted
among them one Form of Government, and
took upon him&s;elf the Title of King. He then
laid the Model of a City, which he de&s;ign'd
as a Seat of Re&s;idence to his new- rais'd King|dom;
and as the most commodious Place for
it, he pitch'd upon a Rock &s;ituate in a large
Plain near the middle of <HI>Attica,</HI> calling both
the City and Territory round it after his own
Name, <HI>Cecropia.</HI> When afterwards the adja|cent
Plains were fill'd with Buildings, this was
the <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or Cittadel that commanded
them.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t introduc'd a Form of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Religion of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> and
pre&s;crib'd to the People both the Objects, and
Modes of Wor&s;hip, erecting Altars, and Sta|tues
in Honour of the Gods, particularly of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Minerva;</HI> from the latter of which,
call'd <HI>Athene</HI> the City took its Name; and
who was always thought to pre&s;ide more im|mediately
over <HI>Athens,</HI> than any other Pa&s;t of

Honour to <HI>Minerva,</HI> this may confirm the
Opinion of his coming out of <HI>Aeypt,</HI> &s;ince
&s;he was the noted Favourite Deity of the <HI>Saitae,</HI>
who came with him. And indeed there &s;eems
to be &s;uch an exact Conformity between the
<HI>Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Rites, and Ceremonies
of Wor&s;hip, that <HI>Aegypt</HI> has been look'd upon
as the chief Fountain of all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Super|&s;tition.
<PB N="115" REF="145">
Some there are, who fetch a great Part
of it out of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and a&s;cribe it to <HI>Orpheus</HI>
as the Author. This too may be true in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure: But that the whole <HI>System</HI> of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Religion &s;hould be borrow'd either
from <HI>Thrace,</HI> or <HI>Aegypt,</HI> or any one Country,
will appear very improbable to tho&s;e, who con|&s;ider
the great Variety of Religions in <HI>Greece,</HI>
where almo&s;t every City had different Gods,
and different Modes of Wor&s;hip. 'Tis more
probable, that <HI>Greece</HI> being inhabited by Colo|nies
from divers Nations, might borrow from
every one of the&s;e &s;ome Part of their Religious
Ceremonies; which from a People &s;o exce&s;&s;ive|ly
Super&s;titious, mu&s;t needs receive daily Im|provements,
'till at la&s;t they were not content
to wor&s;hip their ancient Deities, but frequent|ly
con&s;ecrated new ones of their own making;
and be&s;ides the&s;e, a&s;&s;um'd into their Number
the Gods of all the Nations, with whom they
had any Commerce; in&s;omuch that even in

To this we may odd their <HI>Fea&s;t of all
the &s;trange Gods,</HI> which they religiou&s;ly ob|&s;erv'd:
And it was from the <HI>Athenians</HI> Fear of
omitting any, that we meet with Altars erected
by them to the <HI>Vnknown Gods.</HI> In &s;hort the
<HI>Athenians</HI> were the People, who carry'd their
Super&s;tition highe&s;t, and were always refining
upon Religion, 'till they brought it at la&s;t to
nothing but Shew, and Ceremony.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Cecrops,</HI> his next Care was
of the Civil Government; where for the better
Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and the Promotion
of mutual Intercour&s;e among his Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Athens <HI>di|vided into four Tribes.</HI></NOTE>
he divided them into four <HI>Tribes;</HI> the Names of

a Poll, cau&s;ing every Man to ca&s;t a
Stone into a Place appointed for that Purpo&s;e,
and found the Number amount to twenty
thou&s;and. But the Soil being naturally un|fruitful,
and the People not yet skill'd in Hu&s;|bandry,
&s;uch Multitudes mu&s;t in a &s;hort time

But this Opinion cannot hold, becau&s;e <HI>Solon</HI>
in one of his own Laws mentions Judgments
pa&s;s'd in this Court, before he had reform'd
the Common-wealth. The Rea&s;on of the Mi|&s;take
might be, that <HI>Solon</HI> new-modell'd it, ex|tending
its Power and Privileges, in Oppo&s;ition
to the <HI>Ephetae,</HI> another more rigorous Court,
improv'd, if not in&s;tituted by <HI>Draco.</HI> This
Senate took its Name from the Place in which
it was wont to be a&s;&s;embled, being an Hill
near the Cittadel, &s;acred to <HI>Mars.</HI> It was
one of their mo&s;t famous Courts of Judica|ture;
and was con&s;tituted of Men of the high|e&s;t
Stations in the Common-wealth, as remark|able
for their Virtue and Integrity, as their
Riches and Quality. For this Rea&s;on it was
&s;til'd, <HI>The mo&s;t &s;acred and venerable Tribunal;</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="147">
and their Ju&s;tice was &s;o eminently known
throughout all <HI>Greece,</HI> that Foreign States, when
any Difference happene'd among them, would
often appeal to the <HI>Areopagites,</HI> and &s;tand to
their Determination. And <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> tells
us, that to his time neither <HI>Plaintiff,</HI> nor <HI>Defen|dant,</HI>
had any ju&s;t Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with
their Proceedings. This Court is recorded as
the fir&s;t, that &s;ate upon Life and Death; and
the Trial of wilful Murder &s;eems to have been
the original De&s;ign of its In&s;titution: Tho' in
latter Ages, all Incendiaries, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ines, Con|&s;pirators,
and De&s;erters of their Country, and
mo&s;t capital Cau&s;es in general came under its
Cognizance. The Opinion the State had of
the Gravity and Sanctity of its Members,
gain'd them an unlimited Power, in&s;omuch
that, according to <HI>Solon</HI>'s Regulation of this
A&s;&s;embly, the In&s;pection and Cu&s;tody of the
Laws, the Management of the publick Funds,

them. Their Power extended to Per&s;ons of

and reward the Sober and Indu&s;trious,

and therefore imploy'd all his Intere&s;t and
Cunning to undermine them: Which he did &s;o
effectually, that his Contempt of them &s;erv'd

the Inventor of many u&s;eful Arts, particularly

<HI>Panathenaea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Pana|thenaea.</NOTE> which was al&s;o in&s;tituted by <HI>E|ricthonius,</HI>
where the running with Chariots

<P>Here it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Fe&s;tivals in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Fe|&s;tivals of</HI> Greece.</NOTE> that they were a
great Part of their Religion, being in&s;tituted
chiefly in Honour of their Gods, and Heroes,
who had re&s;cu'd their Country from Slavery, and
Oppre&s;&s;ion, or dy'd in its Defence. And
without doubt this great Encouragement of
tran&s;mitting Mens Names to Po&s;terity, gave
Birth to the many generous Enterpri&s;es of Anti|quity;
tho' they were in Time unhappily im|prov'd
<PB N="122" REF="152">
into <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Fable,</HI> 'till they pa&s;s'd
at la&s;t for downright <HI>Knight-Errantry.</HI> As
their Religion was at fir&s;t more pure, and le&s;s
pompous, &s;o their Fe&s;tivals were few: But in
latter Ages, and particularly in <HI>Athens,</HI> where
their Gods were increas'd almo&s;t to the Num|ber
of Men, the Number and Magnificence of
their Fe&s;tivals ro&s;e in Proportion. For as they
formerly con&s;i&s;ted of little more than a Sacri|fice,
they had afterwards Games, Proce&s;&s;ions,
and a thou&s;and &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervances in I|mitation
of the fabulous Actions of their Gods,
which were introduc'd and practis'd to the va&s;t
Charge of the Publick. But to return to <HI>E|ricthonius,</HI>
he is &s;aid to have brought Silver fir&s;t
into <HI>Attica;</HI> or at lea&s;t to have &s;tamp'd in the
Nature of Coin: And after a Reign of fifty
Years, he left the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Pan|dion.</HI></P>
<P>The Crown had hitherto been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by
Craft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pandion I.</NOTE> or Violence. This <HI>Pandion</HI> was the fir&s;t,
who held it in Right of Succe&s;&s;ion: And tho'
there afterwards happen'd &s;ome Di&s;turbances in
the Government, yet from him it became proper|ly
an hereditary Kingdom. In his Reign <HI>Tripto|lcmus</HI>
is &s;aid to have taught the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
&s;ow and manure the Ground; which he learnt
from <HI>Ceres,</HI> the &s;ame with the <HI>Aegyptian I&s;is,</HI>
who is thought at this time to have come into
<HI>Attica;</HI> and in Honour of whom were in&s;titu|ted
the <HI>Eleu&s;inia,</HI> &s;o call'd from <HI>Eleu&s;is</HI> a Bo|rough-Town
of <HI>Attica.</HI> This Fe&s;tival was cele|brated
with the greate&s;t Secrecy, and Solemnity
of any in <HI>Greece.</HI> It was call'd the <HI>My&s;teries,</HI>
by way of Eminence, without any other note
of Di&s;tinction; and it was Death to divulge

the lea&s;t Part of the Ceremonies. But the

But I had rather agree with the com|mon
Opinion, that <HI>Pandion,</HI> after a Reign of
forty Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Erectheus.</NOTE> left the Kingdom to <HI>Erectheus</HI> his
Son, and a Native of <HI>Attica.</HI></P>

them. To reward which Service, <HI>E|rectheus</HI>

him in a &s;econd War he had with the <HI>Eleu&s;ini|ans,</HI>
who were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Eumolpus</HI> King of
<HI>Thrace. Ion</HI> gain'd &s;o much Power and Cre|dit
in the Common-wealth, that &s;ome fancy he
&s;ucceeded his Grandfather in the Kingdom:
At lea&s;t he had all the Marks of Sovereignty,
but the Title, changing the Name of the Coun|try,
and the four Tribes, as &s;everal of the for|mer
Kings had done. He had a numerous Pro|geny,
which, when <HI>Attica</HI> was over-&s;tock'd
with Inhabitants, was &s;ent out as a Colony in|to
<HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> from whence they were ex|pell'd

&s;everal di&s;tinct Colonies, but pa&s;s'd under the
common Name of the <HI>Ionians.</HI> This is the
<HI>Grecian</HI> Account of <HI>Ion;</HI> but it is built upon
&s;uch Uncertainties, that it &s;till leaves room for
<PB N="124" REF="154">
the Opinion above-mention'd, that he might be

and being a Prince of great Ju&s;tice and Valour,
was rank'd among the Heroes of tho&s;e early
Times, and had Divine Honours paid him af|ter
his Death. The People of <HI>Athens,</HI> who had

who&s;e Daughter he had marry'd. There he
&s;ucceeded his Father-in-law, and left four Sons,
<HI>Aegeus, Lycus, Pallas,</HI> and <HI>Ni&s;us;</HI> who, after

<PB N="125" REF="155">

&s;ay they re&s;tor'd him before he dy'd, and that
at his Death he divided his Kingdom among
them in four equal Proportions. But this not
being generally agreed on, nor which Part fell
to each Man's Lot, we may look upon it as a
Divi&s;ion of their own; and that <HI>Aegeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aegeus.</NOTE> in
effect, &s;ucceeded his Father <HI>Pandion,</HI> after a
Reign of twenty five Years. His Brothers had
their Shares allotted them for a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in
his War with the <HI>Metionidae;</HI> but he had un|doubtedly
the &s;upreme Power with the Sove|reignty
of <HI>Athens</HI> a&s;&s;ign'd to him as the Elde&s;t.
Yet it was not without &s;ecret Murmurings a|mong
the re&s;t; and the rather, becau&s;e <HI>Aegeus</HI>
was generally thought to be only an adopted Son
of <HI>Pandion.</HI> But tho&s;e who gave him the greate&s;t
Umbrage, were the <HI>Pallantidae,</HI> the fifty Sons
of his Brother <HI>Pallas:</HI> And his want of Chil|dren,
the Cau&s;e for which they de&s;pis'd him,
was that which with-held them from breaking
out into open Rebellion, in hopes the Crown
would of Cour&s;e devolve upon them after his
Death. <HI>Aegeus,</HI> who had marry'd two Wives,
and had I&s;&s;ue by neither, went to <HI>Delphi</HI>
to con&s;ult the Oracle about Po&s;terity. The
An&s;wer being &s;omewhat ob&s;cure, in his Return
he went to <HI>Pittheus</HI> the Son of <HI>Pelops</HI> at <HI>Trae|zene,</HI>
a Man of the greate&s;t Knowledge and
Wi&s;dom in his time, to have it explain'd. <HI>Pit|theus</HI>
entertain'd him; and however he inter|preted
the Oracle, it was with his Con&s;ent,
that <HI>Aegeus</HI> lay with his Daughter <HI>Aetbra,</HI> and
left her with Child of <HI>The&s;eus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;eus</HI> prov'd a Youth of great Expectati|on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;eus.</NOTE>
and when he was about &s;ixteen Years old,
<PB N="126" REF="156">
his Mother acquainted him with his Original,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Acts of his Youth.</HI></NOTE>
and &s;ent him to <HI>Athens.</HI> The Country was &s;o
infe&s;ted with Thieves and Murderers, that it
was a very dangerous Journey; yet he cho&s;e
rather to go by Land, than Sea. He was &s;e|cretly
fir'd with the Fame of <HI>Hercules,</HI> to
whom he was al&s;o ally'd by his Mother: And
as he had clear'd the Ways of a great part of
the&s;e Robbers, &s;o <HI>The&s;eus</HI> would endeavour to
&s;uppre&s;s the re&s;t. Accordingly he de&s;troy'd
&s;everal in his Way; and ob&s;erv'd a Method in
Imitation of <HI>Hercules,</HI> whom he propos'd as his
con&s;tant Pattern, to puni&s;h them after the &s;ame
manner they had treated others. At la&s;t he
arriv'd at <HI>Athens;</HI> where he was entertain'd as
a Stranger, but had like to have been poi&s;on'd
by his Father, through the Per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Me|dea,</HI>
who was fled to him from <HI>Corinth.</HI>
But upon his &s;hewing <HI>Aegeus</HI> the Sword,
which he had left with his Mother as a
Pledge, he threw down the Poi&s;on, embrac'd
him, and own'd him publickly for his Son
and Succe&s;&s;or. This &s;erv'd to inflame the
&s;editious Murmurs of the <HI>Pallantidae,</HI> who
highly re&s;ented it, that fir&s;t <HI>Aegeus,</HI> the a|dopted
Son of <HI>Pandion,</HI> and not related to the
Family of <HI>Erectheus,</HI> and then <HI>The&s;eus,</HI>
a perfect Stranger, and a Ba&s;tard too, &s;hould obtain
the Crown of their Ance&s;tors. Upon which
finding their Hopes utterly defeated, they
broke out into open Acts of Ho&s;tility; but
were &s;oon vanqui&s;h'd, and di&s;pers'd by the
Courage and Conduct of <HI>The&s;eus.</HI> Who to
keep him&s;elf in Action, and gain the Favour
of the People, encounter'd &s;everal mon&s;trous
Creatures, which infe&s;ted the Country; and
<PB N="127" REF="157">
particularly the <HI>Marathonian Bull,</HI> which he
overcame, and bringing it alive in Triumph
through the City, &s;acrific'd it to <HI>Apollo.</HI> His
next Exploit was the killing of the <HI>Minotaur,</HI>
a Mon&s;ter kept by <HI>Minos</HI> King of <HI>Crete.</HI> The
Story is told, that <HI>Androgeos</HI> the Son of <HI>Mi|nos</HI>
coming to the Fea&s;t of <HI>Athenaa,</HI> at <HI>Athens,</HI>
excell'd all his Antagoni&s;ts in the Exerci&s;es
perform'd there, and contracted an Intimacy
with the <HI>Pallantidae. Aegeus</HI> fearing lea&s;t he
&s;hould join with them to deprive him of his
Kingdom, made away with him: Which &s;o
incens'd <HI>Minos,</HI> that he declar'd War again&s;t
the <HI>Athenians.</HI> And being at that time Ma&s;ter
of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Seas, gave them &s;o much Di&s;tur|bance,
that they were glad at la&s;t to comply
with the Advice of the Oracle, and &s;end him
by way of Compo&s;ition an annual Tribute, for
the &s;pace of &s;even or nine Years, of &s;even
young Men, and as many Virgins, to be de|vour'd
(as the Fable runs) by this <HI>Minotaur;</HI>
but rather to be kill'd, or kept in Slavery by
<HI>Taurus,</HI> appointed by <HI>Minos</HI> for that Office.
At the third time of &s;ending this Tribute, <HI>The|&s;eus</HI>
offer'd him&s;elf to go among the re&s;t, in
hopes to free his Country from this Slavery,
by de&s;troying the Mon&s;ter. Accordingly he
arriv'd at <HI>Crete,</HI> where he receiv'd of <HI>Ariadne,</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>Minos,</HI> who fell in Love with
him, a Clue of Thread to conduct him through
the Windings of the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> where the
<HI>Minotaur</HI> was kept: And having &s;lain him, re|turn'd
with his Fellow-Captives in Triumph to
<HI>Athens,</HI> and got the Tribute remitted. But in
his Return, through an Exce&s;s of Joy, he for|got
to hang out the White Sail, which &s;hould

<P>II. From <HI>Cecrops</HI> the Fir&s;t to this time, the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Government &s;uffer'd little Alteration.
But <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> as he had freed his Country from
foreign Slavery, and inte&s;tine Sedition, &s;o now
he re&s;olv'd to regulate, and new model the
State.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Altera|tions in the State.</HI></NOTE> Yet being a wife, as well as powerful
Prince, he knew that to attempt any con&s;iderable
Change, he mu&s;t proceed warily, and u&s;e
all the gentle in&s;inuating Methods, e&s;pecially to
a People, who had &s;o &s;trong a Sen&s;e of their
Liberty.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place therefore, to remedy the In|convenience
of having them di&s;pers'd in Villa|ges,
and canton'd up and down the Country,
always quarrelling among them&s;elves, and never
a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult for the publick Good, he
collected all the Inhabitants of <HI>Attica</HI> into one
City, which together with <HI>Cecropia,</HI> the Regal
Seat, he nam'd <HI>Athens.</HI> His Method to effect
this, was to go from one Tribe to another, to
appea&s;e their Differences, and propo&s;e his de|&s;ign
of a common Agreement between them.
The poorer Sort, who could be no Lo&s;ers by
it, readily clo&s;ed with his Advice: To tho&s;e
of Power and Intere&s;t he promis'd a Common-wealth;
<PB N="129" REF="159">
wherein re&s;erving to him&s;elf only the
Command of their Arms, and Cu&s;tody of the
Laws, there &s;hould be an equal Distribution of
all things el&s;e among them, and the Power be
lodg'd wholly in the People. The re&s;t fearing
his Power, which was already grown very for|midable,
and knowing his Courage and Re&s;o|lution,
cho&s;e rather to be per&s;uaded, than forc'd
into a Compliance.</P>
<P>His next Bu&s;ine&s;s, when he had brought
them over thus far to his Propo&s;al, was to di&s;|&s;olve
all the di&s;tinct Courts of Ju&s;tice, and
Corporations belonging to the twelve Towns,
and build one common <HI>Prytaneum,</HI> or Council|hall
in the City. And with a De&s;ign to en|large
his City, he invited all Strangers to come
and &s;ettle there, and enjoy equal Privileges with
the Natives. Yet to prevent Confu&s;ion and
Anarchy, upon &s;uch promi&s;cuous Multitudes
flowing in, he fir&s;t divided the People into
three di&s;tinct Ranks, of Nobles, Husbandmen,
and Artificers. The Nobility he appointed as
the Fountain of Magi&s;tracy; but the Choice be|long'd
in a great Mea&s;ure, if not wholly to the
People. To this fir&s;t Rank he committed the
Teaching and Interpretation of the Laws, and
the Care of Religion; the whole City as to all
other Matters being reduc'd to a Sort of an
Equality, the Nobles excelling in Honour, the
Husbandmen in Profit, and the Artificers in
Number.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;eus</HI> having proceeded thus far with Suc|ce&s;s,
in a manner dive&s;ted him&s;elf, according
to his Promi&s;e, of the Regal Power: Which a
Man of &s;o much Spirit and Bravery, and who
had de&s;erv'd &s;o well of the State, might as
<PB N="130" REF="160">
ea&s;ily have extended, as dimini&s;h'd. Where|fore,
tho' the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Athenians</HI> always
ran high for Liberty; yet he &s;eems rather to
have comply'd with his own Inclination for
popular Government, as be&s;t &s;uited to the
Scheme he had laid down. However, it was
look'd upon as a generous Act of Re&s;ignation:
And this with his Enlarging the City, and his
many other &s;ignal Services, gain'd him the Ti|tle
of <HI>The Second Founder of</HI> Athens. Not that
it was yet a &s;ettled Common-wealth; but this
was &s;o fair an Advance towards it, that the
People from that time continually got Ground
again&s;t the vain Attempts of &s;ome of the &s;uc|ceeding
Kings, to recover the Power with the
Title of <HI>Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Having laid this Foundation, he left it for
others to build upon; and &s;pent the re&s;t of his
Life in Search of new Adventures with <HI>Hercu|les,</HI>
and the other Heroes of his time. As <HI>Her|cules</HI>
had in&s;tituted the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games in Ho|nour
of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;o did he the <HI>I&s;thmian</HI> in Ho|nour
of <HI>Neptune,</HI> who&s;e Son he pa&s;s'd for among
tho&s;e, who could not otherwife account for his
Birth, and the rather, becau&s;e he was a great
Encourager of Trade and Navigation. To
his roving Temper, and Impatience of Ea&s;e, we
mu&s;t refer his <HI>Romantick</HI> Voyage into the
<HI>Euxine</HI> Sea again&s;t the <HI>Amazons,</HI> from among&s;t
whom he got his Wife <HI>Antiope,</HI> or, as &s;ome
call'd her, <HI>Hippolyte.</HI> This gave ri&s;e to the
<HI>Amazonian</HI> War; wherein tho&s;e warlike Wo|men
be&s;ieg'd <HI>Athens,</HI> encamp'd, and gave the
Citizens Battel within their very Walls; 'till at
la&s;t a Peace was concluded by <HI>Antiope</HI>'s Means.
But this War is &s;o differently related, that &s;ome
<PB N="131" REF="161">
have fancy'd there were two Expeditions of
that Kind, and that <HI>Antiope,</HI> and <HI>Hippolyte</HI> were
two di&s;tinct Women. Neither mu&s;t we omit
his celebrated Friend&s;hip which <HI>Pirithous</HI> the
Son of <HI>Ixion,</HI> begun upon an ho&s;tile Interview,
which &s;truck them both with a &s;ecret Admira|tion
of each others Per&s;on and Bravery. <HI>The|&s;eus,</HI>
when he was fifty Years old, join'd with
him in &s;tealing <HI>Helena</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Tyn|dareus,</HI>
from <HI>Sparta,</HI> who falling to him by
Lot, he carry her to his Mother at <HI>Aphidnae,</HI>
to be kept there 'till &s;he were marriagable.
Then having agreed to procure another Wife
for his Friend, they travell'd into <HI>Epirus,</HI> to
&s;teal the Daughter of <HI>Aidoneus,</HI> King of the
<HI>Molo&s;&s;i,</HI> whom the Fable calls <HI>Pluto:</HI> But he
being inform'd of their De&s;ign, kill'd <HI>Pirithous,</HI>
and impri&s;on'd <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> 'till at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Her|cules</HI>
he was &s;et at Liberty. But whil&s;t he was
engag'd in tho&s;e foreign Adventures, <HI>Mene|&s;theus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Peteus,</HI> and great Grand&s;on
of <HI>Erectheus,</HI> took Occa&s;ion from his Ab&s;ence
to ingratiate him&s;elf with the leading Men of
<HI>Athens,</HI> and in&s;inuated, that his late Change in
the State was only a Project to en&s;lave 'em un|der
a Pretence of Liberty. And to favour his
De&s;ign, it happen'd that <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> the

<HI>Athens,</HI> in &s;earch of their Si&s;ter <HI>Helena:</HI> Who

receiv'd into <HI>Athens:</HI> And when <HI>The&s;eus</HI>
return'd, he found the Peoples Minds gene|rally

&s;ucceeding Ages paid a ju&s;t Reverence to his
Relicks; and his Tomb was plac'd as a Refuge
for Slaves, in Memory, that whil&s;t he liv'd,
his whole Care and Study was to redre&s;s Grie|vances,
and relieve the di&s;tre&s;s'd.</P>
<P><HI>Mene&s;theus</HI> by this Means got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of

in the Order of Rank and File. In his Re|turn

in Love with him; to whom he promis'd Mar|riage
after he had been to &s;ettle his Affairs at
<HI>Athens:</HI> But not coming at the time appointed,
&s;he hang'd her&s;elf. The Court of Judicature,
call'd <HI>In Palladio,</HI> was in&s;tituted in his Reign,

&s;ome of the <HI>Argives</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Dio|medes,</HI>

who thereupon u&s;urp'd the Kingdom, and

their two Kings &s;hould decide it. But <HI>Thy|maetes</HI>
declining the Challenge, <HI>Melanthus</HI> a

was their Pretence, which they &s;eldom wanted

'till at la&s;t they got it intirely into their own
Hands. The Title of King was chang'd into

and others to <HI>Pi&s;us,</HI> of whom we have no|thing
left but the Name. But <HI>Pelops</HI> being
more famous in Hi&s;tory, is rather thought to
have instituted them in Honour of <HI>Jupiter&punc;</HI>
And after him <HI>Atreus, Hercules</HI> the Son of
<HI>Alcmena, Oxylus,</HI> and others renew'd them.
<PB N="139" REF="170">
But as yet they were of no &s;ettled Date, being
celebrated only upon &s;ome extraordinary Occa|&s;ions,
and without any remarkable Pomp and So|lemnity.
The fir&s;t, from whom they became
famous, was <HI>Iphitus</HI> King of <HI>Elis,</HI> of the Po&s;te|rity
of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who re&s;tor'd them by the Ad|vice
of the Oracle. They were repeated eve|ry
fifth Year; and hence the Revolution of
four compleat Years, which was the Interval
between each Solemnity, was call'd an <HI>Olympiad.</HI>
But even after <HI>Iphitus,</HI> they &s;eem not to have
been continu'd regularly at fir&s;t, becau&s;e that
which generally pa&s;&s;es for the fir&s;t <HI>Olympiad,</HI>
in which <HI>Coroebus</HI> of <HI>Elis</HI> won the Prize, was
properly the twenty eighth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t</HI> Olympiad.</NOTE> However, it is
from hence the <HI>Vulgar Aera</HI> of the <HI>Olympiads</HI>
takes Date;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> and falls in with the &s;econd Year
of <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> the twelfth <HI>Perpetual Archon</HI> of
<HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3228.</NOTE> four hundred and eight Years after the
De&s;truction of <HI>Troy,</HI> and in the 3228th Year
of the World. This <HI>Epocha</HI> is plac'd by <HI>Var|ro,</HI>
as the Boundary between the <HI>Fabulous,</HI> and
<HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Times, and is &s;o much celebrated for
its Certainty, that &s;ome account the Number of
<HI>Olympiads</HI> among the <HI>Chronological Characters.</HI>
They &s;erv'd as &s;o many Annals, by which the
<HI>Grecians</HI> computed not only their own, but al&s;o
the Hi&s;tories of other Nations. But they were
not pre&s;ently acquainted with this Way of Com|putation;
and as the U&s;e of it in <HI>Chronology</HI>
was only accidental, we mu&s;t inquire into the
more immediate De&s;ign of the&s;e Solemnities.
As to the Original of the&s;e, and the other prin|cipal
Games of <HI>Greece,</HI> they were in&s;tituted in
Honour of the Gods and Heroes; they were
therefore term'd <HI>Sacred,</HI> and are to be con&s;i|der'd
<PB N="140" REF="171">
as a Part of Religion. But be&s;ides
the Spirit of Religion, and the Curio&s;ity
for publick Shews, there were other Politick
Motives, which engaged the Exerci&s;e of them.
It was thought convenient to re-a&s;&s;emble from
time to time, and by the&s;e common Sacrifices,
to re-unite, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o many different States,
independent of each other, and le&s;s &s;eparated
by the Di&s;tance of their Habitations, than the
Diver&s;ity of their Intere&s;ts: So that one main
End of the&s;e Meetings, was to debate, and &s;et|tle
every thing relating to the publick Peace,
and Reputation. As to the Sports them&s;elves,
they were agreeable to the lively <HI>Genius</HI> of the
People, who thought with good rea&s;on, they
could not in times of Peace addict them&s;elves
to Exerci&s;es more honourable, or u&s;eful. For
be&s;ides that by this means they made their
Limbs &s;trong, active and &s;upple, they al&s;o ac|cu&s;tom'd
their Thoughts to the De&s;ire of Con|que&s;t.
It was a kind of <HI>School,</HI> or <HI>Military
Apprentice&s;hip,</HI> in which their Courage found a
con&s;tant Employment: And the Rea&s;on why
the Victory in the&s;e Games was attended with
&s;uch extraordinary Applau&s;e, was that their
Minds might be quicken'd with great and no|ble
Pro&s;pects, when in this Image of War, they
arriv'd to a Pitch of Glory, approaching in
fome Re&s;pects, to that of the mo&s;t famous Con|queror.
They thought this &s;ort of Triumph
one of the greate&s;t Parts of Happine&s;s, of
which human Nature was capable: Upon
which Occa&s;ion, when <HI>Diagoras</HI> had &s;een his
Sons crown'd in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, one of
his Friends made him this Compliment, <HI>Now,</HI>
Diagoras, <HI>you may die &s;atisfy'd; for you can't
<PB N="141" REF="172">
be a God.</HI> Not to de&s;cribe all the Exerci&s;es
perform'd there, we may form a general No|tion
of them from the Remembrance of our
own <HI>Ju&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Tournaments</HI> which held a mid|dle
place between a Diver&s;ion, and a Combat:
But the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games were attended with a
much greater Pomp and Variety; and not only
all <HI>Greece,</HI> but other neighbouring Nations were
in a manner drain'd, to furni&s;h out the Appea|rance.
When they were thus throughly e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
they were continu'd without Inter|mi&s;&s;ion,
&s;o long as <HI>Greece</HI> enjoy'd any degree of
Liberty; and even after that was lo&s;t, &s;ome

made &s;uch con&s;iderable Abatements both in

Name of <HI>Perpetual</HI> now began to &s;ound har&s;h;

the Space of ten Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The De|cennial</HI> Archons. Charops the fir&s;t.</NOTE> The fir&s;t of this <HI>De|cennial</HI>

<P>V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Thus way was made for that more
thorough Change,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3317.</NOTE> whereby the Power and Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
was given up to the People;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ol. 23. 2. <HI>The Go|vernment chang'd in|to a</HI> De|mocracy.</NOTE> who a|greed
in&s;tead of one &s;ingle Man to chu&s;e Nine;
their Authority was to la&s;t but one Year; and
if at the End of it they gave a good Account
of their Admini&s;tration, they pa&s;s'd into the
Senate of <HI>Areopagus</HI> for the re&s;t of their Life.
The fir&s;t of the Nine was <HI>Archon</HI> properly &s;o
call'd, with an additional Title of <HI>Eponymus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office of the Nine <HI>Archons.</HI></NOTE> as
giving Denomination to his Year, wherein all
Affairs of Moment were tran&s;acted in his Name.
He had the Care of a great Part of their Su|per&s;tition,
and kept a &s;ort of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court,</HI>
wherein all Cau&s;es were determin'd betwixt
Men and their Wives, Parents and Children,
Kindred and Neighbours; as al&s;o concerning
Wills, Legacies, Dowries and Inheritances. He
had particularly the Care of Orphans, to ma|nage
their E&s;tates, and a&s;&s;ign them Guardians;
and took the fir&s;t Cognizance of &s;everal pub|lick
Actions. The Second <HI>Archon</HI> had the
Name of <HI>King:</HI> He manag'd another Part of
their Super&s;tition; his Office being to a&s;&s;i&s;t in
the Celebration of &s;everal Fe&s;tivals, to decide
all Di&s;putes between the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Sacred Fa|milies,</HI>
and puni&s;h all Impiety and Prophana|tion
<PB N="143" REF="174">
of the Holy My&s;teries in general. Be|&s;ides
which, he determined &s;everal Cau&s;es both
Civil and Criminal, or &s;ometimes referr'd them
to other Courts. The Third was call'd <HI>Pole|marchus;</HI>
who be&s;ides the Charge of &s;ome Re|ligious
Cu&s;toms, had that of War committed
to him, from whence he had his Name. He
had a great Command in the Armies abroad,
and at home exercis'd the &s;ame Juri&s;diction
over Strangers, that the <HI>Archon</HI> did over the
Citizens. The other Six had the common
Name of <HI>The&s;mothetae.</HI> They were in the Na|ture
of a Court of <HI>Appeal,</HI> upon Complaints of
fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, Calumniating, or Bribery:
And before them were brought all Cau&s;es be|tween
the Citizens and Strangers, and Contro|ver&s;ies
about Trade and Merchandize. They
had properly the Cu&s;tody of the Laws, and
were plac'd as a <HI>Barrier</HI> between the other Ma|gi&s;trates,
and the People; having Power to op|po&s;e the enacting of any Law, which were ap|parently
again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Common-wealth.
The&s;e were their di&s;tinct Offices;
and as to what equally concern'd them in gene|ral,
they had all the Power of puni&s;hing Male|factors
with Death: They had a joint Com|mi&s;&s;ion
for con&s;tituting &s;ome &s;ort of Magi|&s;trates,
and depo&s;ing others, when upon an En|quiry
into their Behaviour, and by the Suf|frages
of the People, they were declar'd un|worthy
of their Office. All together they had
Authority to a&s;&s;emble the People, as the Kings,
and other <HI>Archons</HI> had done upon any emer|gent
Occa&s;ion. And as a Recompence for
their Services, they were free from all Taxes
exacted of other Citizens for the building of
<PB N="144" REF="175">
<HI>Men of War;</HI> which was an Immunity never
granted to any be&s;ides them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creons <HI>the fir&s;t Annual</HI> Archon.</NOTE> The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Annual Archons</HI> was <HI>Creon,</HI> who en|ter'd
upon his Charge in the &s;econd Year of
the twenty third <HI>Olympiad.</HI> From him they
were continu'd regularly: So that whatever In|terruptions
the State &s;uffer'd through Faction
and U&s;urpation; yet was this the con&s;tant &s;et|tled
Form of Government, &s;o long as <HI>Athens</HI>
had the lea&s;t Remains of Life and Liberty.</P>
<P>But this Liberty, of which <HI>The&s;eus</HI> laid the
Foundation, wanted &s;everal Improvements, be|fore
it could receive its fini&s;hing Stroke. The
People had gain'd &s;omething by every Altera|tion:
And the Power of the Magi&s;trates thus
limited, was too weak to bridle &s;uch captious
un&s;ettled Tempers, e&s;pecially without the help
of Laws, both to guide and protect them in
the Execution of their Offices. For it does
not appear, that <HI>Greece</HI> had yet any written
Laws, but was govern'd altogether by the Sentence
of the Magi&s;trate. This occa&s;ion'd dai|ly
Di&s;putes and <HI>Quarrels;</HI> &s;o that they could
come to no Agreement either as to the Reli|gious,
or Civil Admini&s;tration, every Trifle
affording Matter to alarm the Ignorant, and in|cen&s;e
the Factious. Of which we have an In&s;tance in the Attempt of <HI>Cylon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The At|tempt of</HI> Cylon.</NOTE> who had won
the Prize in the <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> at the Celebration of
the thirty fifth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and bore a con&s;idera|ble
Sway in the City. He took Advantage
from the&s;e Di&s;turbances to affect the Sove|reignty,
and in Order to it bad &s;eiz'd the Ca|&s;tle,
where he &s;tood a Siege 'till he was almo&s;e
&s;tarv'd, and then with his Brother made hi$
E&s;cape. His Companions in the mean while
<PB N="145" REF="176">
fled for Refuge to the Image of <HI>Minerva;</HI> but
the Magi&s;trates having entic'd them with
hopes of Pardon, to quit their Sanctuary, put
mo&s;t of them to Death. This was afterwards
reckon'd &s;o heinous an Affront to Religion,
that the City was look'd upon as polluted, and
obnoxious to the Wrath of the <HI>Godde&s;s,</HI> 'till the
Authors were bani&s;h'd: And even after that,
the Memory of this Murder was &s;everal times
reviv'd, and made u&s;e of to keep up a Faction
in the City. This Story is generally plac'd a|bout
the forty fifth <HI>Olympiad:</HI> But that time
may relate more properly to the Expiation of the
Murder, than to the Attempt of <HI>Cylon,</HI> which
&s;eems to have happen'd a con&s;iderable while
&s;ooner.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Athens</HI> continu'd &s;everal Years at a
Stand, 'till at la&s;t her Calamities made her wi&s;e.
She found by degrees, that true Liberty con|&s;i&s;ts
in the due Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on,
and that an intire Subjection to them was not
to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd, but by the Authority of a
Legi&s;lator.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Draco pre|&s;cribes Laws.</NOTE> To this purpo&s;e &s;he pitch'd upon
<HI>Draco,</HI> who was <HI>Archon</HI> in the thirty ninth <HI>Olym|piad;</HI>

even beyond a Sen&s;e of Humanity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Of this
&s;evere Stamp were his Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3380.</NOTE> of which he pub|li&s;h'd
many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ol. 39. 1.</NOTE> leaving the Execution of them
chiefly to the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Ephetae,</HI> which he
new-modell'd for that Purpo&s;e. He puni&s;h'd
almo&s;t every trivial Offence with Death, ma|king
no Di&s;tinction between the &s;tealing of a
Cabbage, or an Apple, and Sacrilege, or Mur|der:
Wherefore it was laid of his Laws, <HI>That
they were writ not with Ink, but with Blood:</HI>
And he him&s;elf being ask'd, <HI>Why he made Death

the greate&s;t.</HI> This rigid Notion of his &s;eems
to have been the Original of the Doctrine of the
<HI>Stoicks,</HI> which prevail'd &s;o much in after Ages.
But the&s;e Laws met with the Fate of all vio|lent
things; for their Severity &s;oon brought
'cm into Di&s;u&s;e. Yet &s;till this gave the Poor
no Relief again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion and U&s;ury of
the Rich, with which they were almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted.
So that the Commons hated the No|bility,
the Nobility fear'd the Commons; and
nothing but De&s;olation &s;eem'd to attend the
State.</P>
<P>At this time happen'd &s;ome Commotions be|tween

The <HI>Athenians</HI> afterwards renew'd their Pre|ten&s;ions

As for <HI>Pittacus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pittacus.</NOTE> he generally pa&s;&s;es for a Ty|rant
of <HI>Mitylene;</HI> but his Conduct has &s;uffici|ently
vindicated that Part of his Character.
For he took the Government rather in Oppo|&s;ition
to others, than out of any private Am|bition;
and held it no longer, than the Nece&s;|&s;ities
of the State requir'd. He made &s;everal

again&s;t Tyranny, he lay him&s;elf under a Su&s;pi|cion
of the &s;ame De&s;igns, which he oppos'd
in others. His Writings were all in the <HI>Ly|rick</HI>
Strain; his Stile clo&s;e, magnificent, and
correct; and tho' he &s;ometimes de&s;cends to
Sports, and Love, yet he always &s;hews him&s;elf
capable of greater Subjects. <HI>Horace,</HI> (with

more remarkable, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively

as it gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome of her fine&s;t Pieces,
&s;o it afterwards was the Cau&s;e of her Death.
She had Wit enough to &s;upply a great many
other Defects: And 'tis ea&s;ie to judge from
the few Remains we have of her, with what
unaffected Force, and Sweetne&s;s &s;he touch'd
the Pa&s;&s;ions, and how de&s;ervedly &s;he has gain'd

on, refus'd to give her, the Poet handled him

&s;trong and nervous, yet &s;hort, and glittering,
and enliven'd with abundance of Wit; but it
had &s;uch a Tincture of Gall and Malice, that

But the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character of them is a
Maje&s;tick Gravity; by which he &s;u&s;tain'd with

of the Loo&s;ene&s;s, and Luxuriancy of his Stile,
that he would not bear the Compari&s;on. He
was al&s;o a Man of the fir&s;t Rank for Wi&s;dom
and Authority among his Fellow-Citizens, and
&s;eems to have had a great hand in the Tran&s;|actions
between that State, and the Tyrant <HI>Pha|laris.</HI>
As he had all along vigorou&s;ly oppos'd
him, &s;o when he had carry'd his De&s;ign, <HI>Ste|&s;ichorus</HI>
was the principal Man in encouraging a
Revolt. Soon after which the Tyrant &s;eiz'd
him, and kept him, 'till he could invent a
Death an&s;werable to his Crime. This gave him
an Opportunity of acquainting him&s;elf with
his Per&s;on and Excellencies, which turn'd his
Fury into the greate&s;t Love and E&s;teem: And
he was ever after &s;o far from entertaining any
<PB N="150" REF="182">
Su&s;picion of him him&s;elf, that he was remark|ably
zealous in vindicating him to others. He
dy'd about the eightieth Year of his Age at
<HI>Catana;</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
the Honour his Relicks did their City, that
they re&s;olv'd to keep them in Defiance of the
<HI>Himerians,</HI> who were no le&s;s ob&s;tinately bent
upon the Recovery of 'em, tho' at the Ex|pence
of a War. The Conte&s;t &s;eems to have
been adju&s;ted by <HI>Phalaris,</HI> who told his Sub|jects,
that where-ever the Poet was bury'd,
yet upon account of his Birth, and Life, he
would &s;till be reckon'd an <HI>Himerian.</HI>
'Tis true this Account of him depends upon the
&s;ingle Authority of <HI>Phalaris</HI> him&s;elf; and tho'
the <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> which pa&s;s under his Name,
&s;hould not be genuine, they &s;erve however to
confirm the E&s;teem, and Character this Poet
bore with Antiquity.</P>
<P>VI. We left the <HI>Athenians</HI> under a di&s;mal
Pro&s;pect of relap&s;ing into their fir&s;t Di&s;orders;
which made them have Recour&s;e to fre&s;h Pre|cautions.
For the Remedy pre&s;crib'd by <HI>Dra|co,</HI>
was it &s;elf in the Nature of a Di&s;ea&s;e: In|&s;omuch
that they, who had the Execution of
his Laws, found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;lacken the
Reins, tho' it was not &s;afe to quit them. In
Order therefore to find out &s;uch <HI>Mediums,</HI>
as were able to recompence the Law for what|ever
they took from it, they ca&s;t their Eyes on
<HI>Solon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solon.</NOTE> a Man not bia&s;s'd by any Party, and
who&s;e great Wi&s;dom and Integrity, together
with his extraordinary Meekne&s;s, had gain'd
him an univer&s;al Love and E&s;teem. But that
which fir&s;t brought him into Repute, was the
<PB N="151" REF="183">
Recovery of the I&s;land <HI>Salamis</HI> his Native
Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Recovers</HI> Salamis.</NOTE> lately revolted from the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
the <HI>Megareans;</HI> which had &s;everal times been
attempted, but with &s;uch ill Succe&s;s, that it
was made Death to &s;tir any more in it. <HI>Solon</HI>
under a Pretence of Madne&s;s, took the Liberty
of making another Motion; and acted his Part
&s;o well, that by the Oddne&s;s of his Ge&s;ture, as
well as the Warmth and Strength of his Rea&s;on|ing,
he brought the People to con&s;ent to another
Expedition: And under his Conduct they &s;ur|priz'd
the I&s;land, by a Stratagem of Dre&s;&s;ing their
young Men in Womens Clothes. <HI>Solon,</HI> upon
the Succe&s;s of this and other Enterprizes, was
cho&s;en <HI>Archon</HI> in the third Year of the forty
&s;ixth <HI>Olympiad;</HI> and be&s;ides the Power of his
Office, was authoriz'd by a general Voice to
regulate their Magi&s;trates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reforms the State.</HI></NOTE> A&s;&s;emblies, Courts,
and Senates; to appoint their Number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> Times

and give them &s;uch a new Set of Laws,
as &s;hould appear to him mo&s;t proper for the
better modelling of the State.</P>
<P>There was &s;o much <HI>Pride, Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Fa|ction</HI>
at this time in the City, that <HI>Solon</HI> &s;eem'd
unwilling to undertake &s;o difficult a Task. They
were chiefly divided into three Parties; one of
which inclin'd to an <HI>Oligarchy,</HI> another to a
<HI>Democracy,</HI> and a third, to ballance the other
two, was for a <HI>mixt Government</HI> between
both. But the common People now ripe for
Sedition, claim'd an equal Divi&s;ion of the pub|lick
Lands in the Hands of the Rich; and were
making them&s;elves a Head to do it by Force,
<PB N="152" REF="184">
when <HI>Solon</HI> appear'd with full Power to redre&s;s
their Grievances, and quell the&s;e Commotions.
To &s;trengthen his Authority, the chief Men
offer'd him the <HI>Tyranny;</HI> and his Friends told
him, <HI>He might ea&s;ily by his Conduct and Mo|deration
change &s;o odious a Name into that of a
Kingdom.</HI> In an&s;wer to them. <HI>A Tyran|ny,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>is a very fair Spot, but it has no
Way to go out at:</HI> And therefore he ab&s;olutely
refus'd it, as not &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with his Scheme
of Reformation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step he made, was in Favour of the
<HI>Commons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Relea&s;es Debtors.</HI></NOTE> to relea&s;e all Debtors by an expre&s;s Law, call'd <HI>Sei&s;acthia,</HI> or the taking off a Bur|den:
And to do it with the lea&s;t Injury he
could to their rich Creditors, he rais'd the Va|lue
of Mony in &s;ome moderate Proportion.
But his Management in this Affair had like to
have prov'd of very ill Con&s;equence: For having
communicated his De&s;ign to &s;ome of his
Friends, they made their Advantage of it, by
taking up va&s;t Sums of Mony, and purcha&s;ing
Land with it; and when the Act was publi&s;h'd,
they refus'd Payment of the Mony, and yet
kept their E&s;tates. The People could not but
fancy <HI>Solon</HI> at the Bottom of this Contri|vance,
'till he clear'd him&s;elf by remitting his
Debtors five, or as others &s;ay, fifteen Ta|lents.
To make the Rich &s;ome further A|mends,
he a&s;&s;ign'd to them, exclu&s;ive of the
People, all Honours, Offices and Employments;
tho' at the &s;ame time he took Care to allay
their Power, by giving every private Citizen a
Privilege of voting in the <HI>Great A&s;&s;embly</HI>
of the whole Body of the State. Which how|ever
<PB N="153" REF="185">
incon&s;iderable it might appear, was &s;oon
found to be of va&s;t Con&s;equence. For it being
permitted any Man, after the Determination of
the Magi&s;trates, to appeal to the People, hence
it came to pa&s;s, that Cau&s;es of the greate&s;t
Weight and Moment were brought before
them. And as they were not always on the
right Side, for this Rea&s;on, <HI>Anachar&s;is,</HI> whom
the Fame of the <HI>Grecian Sages</HI> had drawn from
the extreme Parts of <HI>Scythia,</HI> told <HI>Solon,</HI> He
<HI>wonder'd to &s;ee Wi&s;e Men propo&s;e Cau&s;es, and
Fools determine them.</HI> This Philo&s;opher at a|nother
time was &s;aying to him, <HI>That written
Laws were like Cobwebs; they held fa&s;t the Poor
and Weak, but the Rich aud Powerful ea&s;ily
broke through them.</HI> To which <HI>Solon</HI> reply'd,
<HI>Both Parties will obey the Laws &s;o long as it is
the Intere&s;t of neither to break them.</HI> To &s;ay
the Truth, his chief Care was of the <HI>Commons:</HI>
But yet knowing the danger of committing
things of the highe&s;t Importance to the giddy
unthinking Multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Regulates the Courts of Ju&s;tice.</HI></NOTE> he in&s;tituted the <HI>Great
Council of Four Hundred,</HI> an hundred out of
each Tribe; who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was, carefully to
in&s;pect all Matters before they were brought
into the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of the People. And
as for the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Areopagus,</HI> he was &s;o far
from &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, that he gave the Members
a more exten&s;ive Juri&s;diction; making the&s;e
two <HI>Councils</HI> the <HI>Anchors</HI> of the Common-wealth,
whereby it would be le&s;s liable to be
to&s;s'd by Tumults, and become a Prey to &s;uch
as had Knavery enough to de&s;ign, and Cun|ning
and Eloquence to entice the People to
their own De&s;truction. We mu&s;t not omit a|nother
famous Court call'd the <HI>Helia&s;tick Coun|cil,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="186">
from their &s;itting open and expos'd to the
<HI>Sun.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted of Judges cho&s;en out of the
Body of the People, from fifty to two thou|&s;and,
according as the Exigency of the Cau&s;es
requir'd, of which they determin'd many, and
tho&s;e generally of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>This was his Regulation of the Principal
Courts of Ju&s;tice, with his Provi&s;ions in gene|ral
for the State.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His other Mi&s;cellany Laws.</HI></NOTE> And as for particular In&s;ti|tutions, he fir&s;t repeal'd all <HI>Draco</HI>'s Laws, ex|cept
tho&s;e concerning Murder, and pre&s;crib'd others better &s;uited to the Nature of Offences.
He provided particularly again&s;t Idlene&s;s; in|&s;omuch
that a Son was not oblig'd to maintain
his Father, if he had not brought him up to
&s;ome Trade. He fir&s;t gave leave to make Wills,
whereas before the neare&s;t of Kin inherited of
Cour&s;e: But by this he in&s;inuated, that Friend|&s;hip
and Affection were &s;tronger Ties than
Blood. He ordain'd, that Women &s;hould have
no Portions, which he thought &s;erv'd only to
make them a Prey, and de&s;troy'd the Ends of
Marriage. In the Ca&s;e of an Heire&s;s, he ob|lig'd
him who had marry'd her, to u&s;e her as his
Wife, at lea&s;t three times a Month; and if
he prov'd in&s;ufficient, &s;he might lye with his
neare&s;t Kin&s;man: In other Ca&s;es, any one
might kill an Adulterer if he was taken in the
Act. Common mercenary Pro&s;titutes were
in a great mea&s;ure allow'd of, for the &s;atisfying
of Lu&s;t; but they were not to keep Company
with mode&s;t Women, and, as a Badge of Di|&s;tinction,
wore flower'd Garments; neither
were the Men, who were notorious for fre|quenting
their Company, allow'd to &s;peak in
publick. He who forc'd a Free-Woman,
<PB N="155" REF="187">
was fin'd a hundred Drachms: But this Law|giver
was &s;o indulgent in the Use of Boys,
that he debarr'd only the Slaves from it, as too
great a Privilege. He admitted none into any
part of the Magi&s;tracy under thirty Years of
Age; and when they were enter'd, was more
particularly &s;evere in puni&s;hing their Failings;
in&s;omuch that it was Death to an <HI>Archon</HI> to be
taken Drunk. 'Tis ob&s;ervable he made no Law
again&s;t Parricide, as not imagining any would
be guilty of it. The&s;e were the chief of his Or|dinances,
and many more might be mention'd;
of which one is very remarkable, that he
branded tho&s;e with Infamy, who &s;tood Neuter
in a Sedition; as not thinking they could ever
make good Citizens, who expre&s;s'd no Fellow-feeling
for their Country. He al&s;o reform'd
the <HI>Calendar,</HI> reducing the Year into &s;uch a
Form, as was mo&s;t agreeable to the Motion of
the Sun. Having compleated the Body of the
Laws them&s;elves, he took due Care for the
Execution of them, that the Citizens might
not pretend Ignorance in what they were to do,
or to avoid. To this End, Tran&s;cripts of them
were publickly expos'd in the City for every
one to peru&s;e; at lea&s;t, &s;o that any one might
have Recour&s;e to them upon Occa&s;ion: And
it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>The&s;mothetae</HI> to Re|vi&s;e
them carefully, and repeat them di&s;tinctly
once a Year. For the further Information of
the People, when they were &s;ummon'd to the
<HI>General A&s;&s;embly,</HI> they had Notice given 'em
of the &s;ubject Matter of the Debate, and time
to prepare them&s;elves accordingly. <HI>Solon</HI>'s la&s;t
Care was to perpetuate his Laws: And lea&s;t through the Connivance of the Magi&s;trates
<PB N="156" REF="188">
they &s;hould in time be neglected, like tho&s;e of
his Pedece&s;&s;or, he caus'd the Senate to take a
&s;olemn Oath to ob&s;erve them; and every one
of the <HI>The&s;mothetae,</HI> vow'd that if he violated
any of them, he would dedicate a Golden Sta|tue
of equal weight with him&s;elf to the <HI>Del|phian
Apollo:</HI> The People he al&s;o oblig'd to
ob&s;erve 'em a hundred Years.</P>
<P>Thus he fini&s;h'd his new Settlement; where|in
his chief Aim was to poi&s;e one Part of the
State with the other: So that what the Com|mons
wanted in Wealth and Honour, was &s;uf|ficiently
made up to them in their Share of the
Government. This was reducing things, as
near as he could, to an exact Equality: And
indeed it was no ea&s;ie Task to find out a Cure
for &s;uch a Complication of Di&s;tempers, where
the Weakne&s;s of tho&s;e he had to do with,
would hardly permit him to make U&s;e of &s;uit|able
Remedies. And therefore when one ask'd
him, if he had pre&s;crib'd good Laws to the
<HI>Athenians, Yes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>as good as they are ca|pable
of receiving.</HI> Since therefore they would
admit of no Government, but a <HI>Democracy,</HI> he
form'd his Laws according to that Model. It
did not indeed come up to that of <HI>Sparta</HI> laid
down by <HI>Lycurgus;</HI> and the Difference is ea&s;ily
accounted for, from the Temper of the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
which was too delicate, and capricious,
to be brought to tho&s;e grave and regular Au|&s;terities;
and without con&s;idering the great
Sway the People bore in the Execution of the
Laws, the Laws them&s;elves were more nume|rous
and confus'd, and could not therefore be
&s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, as they were at <HI>Sparta.</HI>
Yet &s;uch this E&s;tabli&s;hment was, as re&s;tor'd
<PB N="157" REF="189">
the Love of Labour and Husbandry, made
way for Commerce, put the <HI>Athenians</HI> into a
Condition of being rich at home, and powerful
abroad, and with the Rules of Ju&s;tice, Order,
and Di&s;cipline, &s;erv'd to tame and poli&s;h a Peo|ple
bred up in Liberty, and per&s;uaded that
Force and Violence were the only Pre&s;ervatives
again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>VII. This new Con&s;titution, tho' generally
well receiv'd, yet was not free from Cen&s;ure:
And therefore <HI>Solon,</HI> to prevent all cavilling and
tampering with him about his Laws, got leave
to travel for ten Years, in hopes they would in
that time be e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Cu&s;tom. But whil&s;t
he was abroad taking a Survey of <HI>Aegypt, Cyprus,</HI>
and <HI>Lydia, Athens</HI> was again imbroil'd by the
old Faction of the three contending Parties a|bout
the Form of the Common-wealth.
The poorer Sort inclining mo&s;t to a <HI>Democracy,</HI> were
headed by <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pi&s;i&s;tra|tus</NOTE>. de&s;cended from King <HI>Co|drus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pi&s;i&s;tra|tus.</NOTE>
and by the Mother's Side related to <HI>Solon;</HI>
a Man made up of De&s;ign and Artifice,
yet &s;eemingly open, tractable, and without Pa&s;|&s;ion.
He profe&s;s'd nothing &s;o much as a De&s;ire
of Equality, and Aver&s;ion to Change; and
manag'd the Di&s;gui&s;e with &s;omething &s;o mo|de&s;t
and affable in his Behaviour, and &s;uch a
&s;oft and voluble Tongue, that it was not ea&s;ie
to re&s;i&s;t the Appearance of &s;o much Merit.
Nor indeed did any Body &s;u&s;pect him, but
<HI>Solon,</HI> who being return'd, &s;oon perceiv'd he
was &s;etting up for him&s;elf; and endeavour'd to
take him off fir&s;t by fair Means, often decla|ring
both to him&s;elf and others, <HI>That if it were
not for his De&s;ire of Rule, he knew no Body better
<PB N="158" REF="190">
form'd for a good Man, and a good Citizen,</HI>
But <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of the good
Opinion of tho&s;e, who had thrown them&s;elves
upon his Protection; and having wounded
him&s;elf, went in his Chariot into the Market-place,
where he complain'd of having been bar|barou&s;ly
a&s;&s;aulted for his good Intentions to
the Publick; and demanded a Guard might be
a&s;&s;ign'd him for the Defence of his Per&s;on,
<HI>Solon,</HI> upon this Exploit, compar'd him to <HI>&V;|lysses</HI>
in <HI>Homer,</HI> but told him, <HI>He did not act
the Part right; for his De&s;ign,</HI> &s;ays he, in cut|ting
him&s;elf, was to deceive his Enemies, but
Yours is again&s;t your Fellow-Citizens. He al&s;o
upbraided the People with their Stupidity, tel|ling
them, <HI>That for his own Part, he had Wit
enough to &s;ee through this De&s;ign, and Courage
enough to oppo&s;e it.</HI> But <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> his Party
prevail'd; and having obtain'd a Guard of fifty
Men, he in&s;en&s;ibly increas'd the Number, 'till
by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the
Ca&s;tle, and with that of the Sovereignty.</P>
<P>This gave a general Alarm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>U&s;urps the Govern|ment.</HI> A. M.</NOTE> and <HI>Solon</HI> was not
wanting in his repeated Efforts to the People, telling 'em, <HI>They might with more Ea&s;e indeed
have cru&s;h'd the Tyranny in the Bud;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3443.</NOTE> but that
<HI>it would be more glorious now to pluck it up by
the Roots.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 54. 4</NOTE> But the Surprize &s;truck &s;uch a
Damp into their Spirits, that no Body offer'd
to back his Remon&s;trances. On the contrary,
they ask'd him, <HI>To what he him&s;elf tru&s;ted, that
he ventur'd to &s;peak &s;o boldly?</HI> To whom he
reply'd, <HI>My Age.</HI> Finding all ways ineffe|ctual
to move them, he retir'd, &s;aying, <HI>He
had at lea&s;t the Satisfaction of having di&s;char|ged
his Duty to his Country, and the Laws.</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="191">
Soon after, that he might not &s;eem to counte|nance
this Change, he quitted <HI>Athens;</HI> and
tho' <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> importun'd him to return, he
cho&s;e rather to &s;pend the Remainder of his Life
in <HI>Lydia, Cilicia</HI> and <HI>Cyprus.</HI> In the former of
the&s;e Places he had the famous Conference with
<HI>Craoe&s;us</HI> about Happine&s;s; the Re&s;ult of which was,
<HI>That no Man could be accounted happy before he
dy'd. Croe&s;us,</HI> who had invited him to admire
the Pomp and Grandeur of his Court, di&s;m&s;s'd
him with a Contempt of his Ignorance, or ill
Manners: But being afterwards taken Pri&s;oner
by <HI>Gyrus,</HI> and order'd to be burnt alive, he
cry'd out thrice upon <HI>Solon;</HI> of which <HI>Cyrus</HI>
demanding the Rea&s;on, <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> told him all
that had formerly pa&s;s'd between 'em, and that
now he found his Words verify'd. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was
&s;o affected with the Relation, that he not only
&s;et him at Liberty, but contracted a Friend|ship
with him much to the Honour of <HI>Solon,</HI>
who by this means had pre&s;erv'd one King,
and at the &s;ame time in&s;tructed another. In
<HI>Cilicia</HI> he founded a City call'd from him&s;elf

Maxims of Civil Prudence, and Morality, with|out

Ju&s;tice and Hone&s;ty, Piety to Friends and Re|lations,
Zeal for the Publick, and other common
Offices of Life. Out of this loo&s;e Collection,
each of them a&s;&s;um'd to him&s;elf &s;ome one Sen|tence
more remarkably expre&s;&s;ive, in the Nature
of a <HI>Motto.</HI> But the fir&s;t of the Seven had
more refin'd Notions than the re&s;t, carrying
his Thoughts from Matters of immediate U&s;e,
and Practice, to Speculation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="193">
And here it may be requi&s;ite to make a more
&s;trict Enquiry into the Birth of <HI>Philo&s;o|phy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Birth of Philo&s;ophy.</HI></NOTE>
which is certainly to be dated from this Period of
Time, and is almo&s;t univer&s;ally a&s;&s;ign'd to
<HI>Greece.</HI> Not but that &s;ome Parts of it were of a
more early and foreign Extraction, being chiefly
&s;uch, as ow'd their Original to Chance, or Ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
Thus the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> $orm'd the Prin|ciples
of <HI>Geometry</HI> from the Divi&s;ion of their
Harve&s;ts, when their Land-marks had been &s;wept
away by the Inundation of the <HI>Nile.</HI> The
<HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> from the Advantage of an open
Champaign Country, a clear Sky, and abun|dance
of Lei&s;ure, naturally betook them&s;elves
to the Contemplation of the Stars, and from
thence laid the Foundation of <HI>A&s;tronomy:</HI> A|mong
them the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> refin'd upon the&s;e
Speculations, and improv'd them into Notions of
<HI>A&s;trology.</HI> And the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> drew a fur|ther
more certain and beneficial U&s;e from them
respect of their Navigation; wherein they
&s;ucceeded &s;o well, that they were the fir&s;t who
found out, that there was a fixt Point towards
the Pole, by which Pilots might &s;teer with
Safety. The mo&s;t gene$al and exten&s;ive Parts
of Learning the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> laid claim to: Tho'
we have nothing certain of the fir&s;t Planters of
Civility among them, e&s;pecially before their fa|mous
<HI>Hermes Tri&s;megistus;</HI> and even of him
tho&s;e Remains, which are &s;till extant, are look'd
upon as a Suppo&s;ititious Mixture of <HI>Aegyptiab,
Platonick</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Doctrine. It
&s;eems probable, that they deriv'd a con&s;iderable
Share of their Knowledge from their long and
free Intercour&s;e with the fir&s;t People, the <HI>Jews.</HI>
For be&s;ides the time of their Captivity among
<PB N="162" REF="194">
them, <HI>Aegypt</HI> was excepted from that general
Abhorrence, they were commanded to expre&s;s
for mo&s;t of the other <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But whatever
Foundation they had laid of the Arts and Sci|ences,
it is certain they did not make a &s;uitable
Progre&s;s in them. For as they were a People
gro&s;ly Super&s;titious, the Prie&s;ts taking Advan|tage
of their Weakne&s;s, work'd up their Ob|&s;ervations
on Nature into a &s;ort of <HI>Theology;</HI>
and by veiling them under <HI>Symbols,</HI> and <HI>Hiero|glyphicks</HI>
from the Apprehensions of the Vulgar,
turn'd every thing into My&s;tery and Religion,
They had their De&s;ign, which was to beget a
Reverence in the Peoples Hearts towards them|&s;elves:
But this &s;ecret Management was far
from making any real Advancement in Philo&s;o|phy.
It &s;erv'd however to give them a mighty
Reputation in the World; which put the <HI>Gre|cians,</HI>
who were of a very active and inqui&s;i|tive
Temper, upon diving into their My&s;teries.
With this De&s;ign they made &s;everal Voyages to
them; and notwith&s;tanding this <HI>aegyptian
Darkne&s;s,</HI> made &s;ome Di&s;coveries, which they
carry'd home with them, and which &s;erv'd as
the Ground-work for an ample Super&s;tructure.
Government being the principal Care of all
Nations, <HI>Solon, Lycurgus,</HI> and others bent their
Studies this way, and made no further U&s;e of
their Travels, than to enrich their Schemes with
Laws and State-Policies. Others, who were
le&s;s engaged in State-Affairs, turn'd their
Thoughts upon more &s;ubtle, and refin'd Spe|culations
concerning Nature, and the Works of
Providence. The fir&s;t, who made any &s;ucce&s;s|ful
Attempts this way, at lea&s;t the fir&s;t we have
any certain Account of, was <HI>Thales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thales</NOTE>. who was
<PB N="163" REF="195">
born in the thirty fifth <HI>Olympiad,</HI> and was thought
to be originally a <HI>Phaenician,</HI> but living at <HI>Miletus</HI>
of <HI>lonia,</HI> was call'd the <HI>Mile&s;ian.</HI> He introduc'd
into <HI>Greece</HI> the Elements of <HI>Geometry</HI> and <HI>A&s;tro|nomy;</HI>
and form'd &s;everal plau&s;ible Notions of the Theory of
the <HI>&V;niver&s;e,</HI> which he con|ceiv'd
to be animated by a <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> as
the <HI>Soul</HI> of it, and the Author of all natural
Motion. He had al&s;o &s;ome &s;aint Idea of the
Immortality of the Soul. To him is a&s;crib'd
the Invention of taking the Heighth of the <HI>Pyra|mids</HI>
by their Shadows. He divided the Ce|le&s;tial
Sphere into five Circles: He fir&s;t ob|&s;erv'd
the Sol&s;tices, and Aequinoxes; and di&s;co|ver'd
the Rea&s;on of Eclip&s;es, which before
were look'd upon as &s;upernatural Pre&s;ages of
&s;ome publick Calamity. His particular Tenet was,
that Water is the fir&s;t Principle of all Natural
Bodies. Having enrich'd his Country with
Trea&s;ures of this kind, he pa&s;s'd for the <HI>Origi|nal
Founder of Philo&s;ophy;</HI> and dy'd about nine|ty
Years old, as he was &s;itting a Spectator at
the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games. His Dactrine was &s;oon
propagated by <HI>Anaximander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anaxi|mander.</NOTE> and <HI>Anaximence,</HI>
both <HI>Mile&s;ians,</HI> and his Scholars; the former of
which made &s;uch con&s;iderable Improvements,
that he is reckon'd the more immediate <HI>Founder
of the</HI> Ionick <HI>Sect.</HI> In oppo&s;ition to his Ma&s;ter's
Opinion concerning Water, he made Infinity
the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Principle.</HI> He di&s;tingui&s;h'd the
four Elements, di&s;cover'd the Obliquity of
the <HI>Zodiack</HI> and form'd the fir&s;t Draught of
a general Sy&s;tem, by placing the Earth in the
Centre of the <HI>&V;niver&s;e.</HI> The&s;e were the Steps
the&s;e fir&s;t Heroes made in Philo&s;ophy: And
tho' they did not arrive to any di&s;tinct Know|ledge,
<PB N="164" REF="196">
&s;o as to take off that Veil, which was
drawn over mo&s;t of the Works of Providence
yet it redounds very much to their Glory, that
they trac'd out the Way &s;o far, as to make them
the Subject of a more &s;evere and accurate En|quiry.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ionick</HI> Philo&s;ophy was &s;oon Eclips'd
by another Sect of a much greater Extent and
Duration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pythago|ras.</NOTE> which was call'd the <HI>Italick,</HI> and
e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Per&s;on of <HI>Pythagoras:</HI> Of
whom we may give &s;ome general Account,
without entering upon the many Contradicti|ons
and Ab&s;urdities, which have &s;ully'd both
the Life and Doctrine of this great Man. He
was born at <HI>Samos</HI> towards the forty &s;eventh <HI>O|lympiad.</HI>
He &s;tudy'd fir&s;t under <HI>Hermodamas</HI>
a Grammarian, and then improv'd himself un|der
<HI>Pherecydes</HI> of <HI>Syrus</HI> one of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> a
Man of great Repute for his Wi&s;dom, and
the fir&s;t, as <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, who a&s;&s;erted the Im|mortality
of the Soul. He travell'd young in|to
<HI>Aegypt;</HI> where being well recommended by
<HI>Polycrates,</HI> he found an ea&s;ie Acce&s;s to the
Prie&s;ts: Tho' as they were naturally Jealous
and Uncommunicative, they enjoin'd him all
the Au&s;terities of their Order, in hopes to de|ter
him from penetrating too far into their
My&s;teries. But his Curio&s;ity carry'd him
through the &s;tricte&s;t Cour&s;e of Probation; and
having in five and twenty Years enrich'd him|&s;elf
with great Variety of Learning, he return'd
home. Where being under &s;ome Apprehen|&s;ions
from the Tyranny e&s;tabli&s;h'd at <HI>Samos,</HI> he
remov'd fir&s;t to <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Crotona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> where he &s;pent
the Re&s;idue of his Life; and was at la&s;t either
<PB N="165" REF="197">
kill'd, or &s;tarv'd to Death by means of a Tu|mult
rais'd by one <HI>Cylon,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Pythagoras</HI>
finding him to be a profligate young Man,
wou'd not admit him into his School. The
Inhabitants of <HI>Crotona</HI> had formerly by their
Indu&s;try and Courage gain'd &s;uch a Reputati|on,
that it was &s;aid proverbially of them, <HI>The
la&s;t of the</HI> Crotoniates <HI>is the fir&s;t of the</HI> Greci|ans.
But having &s;uffer'd a great Lo&s;s in a Bat|tel
with the <HI>Locrians,</HI> they were &s;unk into a
State of Sloth and Effeminacy at the time
when <HI>Pythagoras</HI> &s;ettled among them. Who
thinking it a Task worthy his Care to re&s;tore
th$m to a &s;en&s;e of their former Merit, exerted
him&s;elf in the Nature of a Lawgiver, and pre|&s;crib'd
to them &s;uch convincing Rules of Re|ligion,
Ju&s;tice, Temperance, and other Virtues,
that they ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ented to every thing he &s;aid,
and the Magi&s;trates them&s;elves courted him to
accept a Share in the Admini&s;tration. After
this Reformation of their Manners, he began
to make open Profe&s;&s;ion of his Wi&s;dom, in or|der
to e&s;tabli&s;h his Sect. But thinking the
Title of <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> which his Predece&s;&s;ors had a&s;|&s;um'd
to them&s;elves, too arrogant, he mode&s;tly
declin'd it, and was the fir&s;t that call'd him&s;elf
a <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> or <HI>Lover of wi&s;dom,</HI> He enjoin'd
his Scholars Silence for five Years, to make
him&s;elf heard with more Attention and Re|&s;pect.
He had learn'd in <HI>Aegypt</HI> to give to all
his In&s;tructions an Air of Gravity and My&s;tery:
Yet to avoid being too Enigmatical, he cho&s;e to
deliver mo&s;t of them in <HI>Symbols;</HI> which un|der
a Sen&s;e that was plain and &s;imple, inclu|ding
another that was wholly figurative, he
endeavour'd by them neither to <HI>divulge</HI> his Doctrine,
<PB N="166" REF="198">
nor to <HI>conceal</HI> it; for the&s;e &s;hort Expre&s;|&s;ions
held a middle place between the <HI>Hierogly|phick</HI>
and the common way of Di&s;cour&s;e, and
were therefore thought mo&s;t proper for his
De&s;ign, which was to <HI>di&s;clo&s;</HI> the Truth with|out
<HI>prophaning</HI> it. His common Method of
teaching was by <HI>Geometry, Numbers,</HI> and <HI>Mu|&s;ick;</HI>
by the fir&s;t of which he explain'd mate|rial
and &s;en&s;ible things, and by the two latter,
intellectual, Not that he fancy'd there was
any intrin&s;ick Virtue in Numbers, but that
the&s;e ju&s;t Proportions, as they &s;erv'd to divide
and explain things, &s;o they made his Do|ctrine
appear more profound, than really it was,
As to his <HI>Theology,</HI> he was the fir&s;t who brought
into <HI>Greece</HI> the true Name of <HI>God,</HI> which he
communicated to his Di&s;ciples under the Name
of <HI>Quaternion,</HI> or <HI>Number of Four;</HI> For the
<HI>Quaternion</HI> of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is allow'd to be the
<HI>inutterable</HI> Name, or the <HI>Jehovah</HI> of the <HI>He|brews.</HI>
He had al&s;o been brought up in a
Belief of the Soul's Immortality: But becau&s;e
he could not conceive how it &s;hould exi&s;t after
its Separation from the Body, this put him up|on
e&s;tabli&s;hing his Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;y|cho&s;is,</HI>
or Tran&s;migration of Souls; and for this
Rea&s;on he forbad the eating of Fle&s;h, or u&s;ing
it in Sacrifices. He was the first who taught
the Principles of <HI>Phy&s;icks:</HI> And tho' we cannot
expect from him any compleat Sy&s;tem, yet
there was in the whole Cour&s;e of his Enquiries
&s;omething more &s;olid and regular, than what
had hitherto been deliver'd. From hence it
was, that his Sect &s;oon arriv'd to be the only
one of a fix'd Reputation; and out of it came
all the Philo&s;ophers, who flouri&s;h'd for the
<PB N="167" REF="199">
Space of near four hundred Years, and who
were divided into &s;o many different Sects.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Athens, Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> did not
enjoy his U&s;urpation much above three Years,
before he was di&s;plac'd by <HI>Megacles,</HI> and <HI>Ly|turgus,</HI>
the Heads of the two other Factions;
who al&s;o in five Years more were a Means of
his Re&s;titution. For not agreeing among them|&s;elves,
<HI>Megacles</HI> promis'd to re&s;tore him upon
Condition he would marry his Daughter.
With this De&s;ign, they dre&s;s'd up <HI>Phya</HI> a $all
Woman in Armour to counterfeit <HI>Minerva,</HI>
and putting her in a Chariot, &s;ent to prepare
the Citizens for her Reception, telling 'em, the
<HI>Godde&s;s</HI> was come in Per&s;on in behalf of <HI>Pisi|stratus:</HI>
Which being acted with wonderful
A&s;&s;urance, &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that they imme|diately
ador'd the Deity, and re-in&s;tated her
<HI>Favourite.</HI> In about ten Years <HI>Megacles</HI> re|viv'd
the Quarrel upon a Pretence that <HI>Pi&s;i|&s;tratus</HI>
&s;lighted his Daughter, and having mar|ry'd
her only to regain the Sovereignty, did
not u&s;e her as his Wife. He being inform'd
of their De&s;igns again&s;t him, retir'd voluntari|ly
into <HI>Eretria,</HI> a City of <HI>Euboea:</HI> And after
ten Years more having form'd an Alliance with
the <HI>Argives,</HI> and <HI>Thebans,</HI> got <HI>Marathon</HI> a
Town of <HI>Attica,</HI> into his Hands. From thence
he march'd again&s;t <HI>Athens,</HI> routed tho&s;e who
came out again&s;t him, and that they &s;hould
not rally, &s;ent 'em word, <HI>They had nothing to
fear from him, if they would go Home, and be
quiet.</HI> By this Means he got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;oion the
third Time, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd him&s;elf by his
Mony and Allies, and by keeping his Enemies
Sons as Ho&s;tages 'till his Death, which hap|pen'd
<PB N="168" REF="200">
not long after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pi&s;i&s;tratus <HI>his Death,</HI></NOTE> During the whole cour&s;e

him&s;elf with &s;uch Moderation and Ju&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3476.</NOTE> as
might have put lawful Sovereigns to the Blu&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 63. 1</NOTE>
Of which we have an In&s;tance in <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
that being accus'd of a Murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And Cha|racter.</HI></NOTE> tho' it was in
the time of his Tyranny, he went to plead his
Cau&s;e before the <HI>Areopagites;</HI> but his Accu&s;er
did not appear. He not only carry'd it fair
with <HI>Solon,</HI> but paid a &s;ort of Reverence to his
Per&s;on, and his Laws; to which he made &s;ome
few Additions, by providing for the Mainte|nance
of maim'd Soldiers, to oblige the Army,
and ordering the Country to be kept in good
Tillage. The Pretence of this la&s;t, was to
prevent Idlene&s;s, and promote Husbandry; but
the real De&s;ign was to di&s;per&s;e the People, as
the &s;ure&s;t Method to take away all Occa&s;ion of
plotting and caballing, and to &s;upport a precari|ous
Government. Be&s;ides his natural Talent
for Oratory, he had more acquir'd Learning,
than was generally to be met with in tho&s;e
Times; and expre&s;s'd a particular E&s;teem of
it, by erecting the fir&s;t publick Library. He
was certainly Ma&s;ter of many excellent Quali|ties;
and perverted them no further, than as
they &s;tood in Competition with Empire. So that
the People had nothing to object again&s;t him,
but his having a Power greater than the Laws;
and by his not exerting that Power, when it
was in his Hands, he almo&s;t conquer'd the A|ver&s;ion
the <HI>Athenians</HI> had conceiv'd for the
<HI>Royalty.</HI> Upon the&s;e Accounts he was de&s;er|vedly
oppos'd to other Tyrants, and U&s;upers:
And <HI>Cic$ro</HI> thought it no Reflection upon <HI>Ju|lius
<PB N="169" REF="201">
Ce&s;ar,</HI> to call him <HI>The</HI> Pi&s;i&s;tratus <HI>of</HI> Rome.
In another Place, doubting with him&s;elf how
that Emperor would u&s;e his good Fortune af|ter
the Battel of <HI>Phar&s;alia, We are uncertain yet,</HI>
&s;ays he to his Friend <HI>Atticus, whether the Fate
of</HI> Rome <HI>will have it, that we groan under a</HI>
Phalaris, <HI>or enjoy our &s;elves under a</HI> Pi&s;i&s;tratus.</P>
<P>He left his three Sons, <HI>Hippias, Hipparchus,</HI>
and <HI>The&s;&s;alus,</HI> in joint Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Go|vernment,
the &s;upreme Authority being lodg'd

him the mo&s;t de&s;erving of the three; and &s;ays
he ingratiated him&s;elf with the People by
quitting his Share in the Tyranny. But the
Accounts of the two former being more clear,
and full, we mu&s;t confine our &s;elves to their
Stay. They continu'd the Laws, and Magi|&s;trates
as they found them; adorn'd the City;
and exacted only the twentieth Part of the
publick Revenue: They agreed &s;o well a|mong
them&s;elves, and pur&s;u'd their Father's
Methods &s;o &s;uccesfully, that <HI>Athens</HI> had &s;till
nothing but the Name of Tyranny to com|plain
of.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t leave them in the quiet Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of <HI>Athens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of <HI>Samos</HI> un|der Poly|crates.</NOTE> to take a View of another Ty|ranny
erected about the &s;ame time in <HI>Samos.</HI>
The Government of this I&s;land had hitherto
been in the Hands of the People: <HI>Herodotus</HI>
indeed mentions a former King under the Name
of <HI>Amphicrates,</HI> but without the time or other
Circum&s;tances of his Reign; and therefore we
may look upon <HI>Polycrates</HI> as the fir&s;t, of whom
we have any certain Account. He having u|&s;urp'd
the Government, at fir&s;t divided it with
<PB N="170" REF="202">
his two Brothers; 'till having murder'd one,
and bani&s;h'd the other, he became ab&s;olute,
and e&s;tabli&s;h'd him&s;elf by an Alliance with <HI>Aegypt.</HI>
It was a Maxim with him, <HI>That he gra|tify'd
his Friend more by re&s;toring what he had taken,
than if he had never taken any thing from
him.</HI> Wherefore having made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter
of a Fleet of a hundred Sail, he hara&s;s'd all the
Country about him; made his Name formida|ble
both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and had &s;uch an
incredible Glut of good Fortune to encourage
his Attempts, that from oppre&s;&s;ing his Subjects
and Neighbours, he a&s;pir'd to the Sovereignty
of <HI>Greece.</HI> In the mean while an exil'd Party
of the <HI>Samians,</HI> tho' they were an <HI>Athenian</HI> Co|lony,
addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the <HI>Lacedaemoni|ans</HI>
for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. For <HI>Sparta</HI> by her
&s;trict Di&s;cipline, and the late &s;ucce&s;sful Effects
of it in the <HI>Me&s;&s;enian</HI> Wars, had &s;o far got the
&s;tart of her Neighbours in Military Glory,
that the fir&s;t Application of any State in Di|&s;tre&s;&s;,
was generally made to her. The <HI>Lace|daemonians</HI>
gave them a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, as
thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the Tyrant's Pro|gre&s;s:
So that whatever &s;pecious Pretences they
form'd to palliate the Bu&s;ine&s;s, they re&s;olv'd to
pro$eed again&s;t him as a common Enemy.
Accordingly they arriv'd at <HI>Samos</HI> with a great

<P>But to return to <HI>Athens,</HI> this Harmony in

He was a Man of Wi&s;dom and Learn|ing,

with a young Man call'd <HI>Harmodius;</HI> and find|ing
after many Sollicitations he would not com|ply,
to be reveng'd of him, offer'd Violence
to his Si&s;ter. <HI>Harmodius</HI> acquainted his Friend
<PB N="172" REF="204">
<HI>Ari&s;togiton</HI> with the whole Affair; who being
al&s;o a pa&s;&s;ionate Admirer of him, they form'd
a Con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> and the Ty|ranny.
They fix'd the Execution of their De&s;|igns
upon the Fea&s;t of <HI>Panathenaea,</HI> becau&s;e at
that time they might go arm'd without Su&s;pi|cion;
and taking their Opportunity, ru&s;h'd in
upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hipparchus <HI>kill'd</HI></NOTE> and &s;tabb'd him, but were them|&s;elves
al&s;o &s;lain in the Tumult. <HI>Hippias</HI> to pre|vent
further Di&s;orders, got all tho&s;e di&s;arm'd,
whom he could any way &s;u&s;pect as Accompli|ces
in the Enterpri&s;e; and tho' he was &s;uffici|ently
exa&s;perated at his Brother's Death, he
did not think this a proper time to re&s;ent it.
But not knowing how far this Accident might
contribute to the Subver&s;ion of the Tyranny,
he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike a Terror into
his Subjects, before they had gain'd too far
upon him. So that from that time he became
cruel and imperious, and endeavour'd to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
him&s;elf by Mea&s;ures quite contrary to
tho&s;e he had hitherto pur&s;u'd.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Athenians</HI> being more thoroughly
rous'd by this violent Proceeding, thought it
time to throw off the Yoke, when they felt
the Weight of it. The chief who stirr'd in it,
were the <HI>Alcmaeonidae,</HI> a part of <HI>Megacles's</HI> Fa|ction,
de&s;cended from <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> by <HI>Alcmaeon,</HI> and
driven out of <HI>Me&s;&s;enia</HI> by the <HI>Heraclidae.</HI> They
di&s;tru&s;ting their own Strength, corrupted the
<HI>Pythia</HI> to engage the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in their
Quarrel; &s;o that whatever Bu&s;ine&s;&s; the <HI>Spar|tans</HI>
con&s;ulted about at <HI>Delphi,</HI> the Oracle con|stantly
propos'd to them the &s;etting <HI>Athens</HI> at
Liberty. By which repeated Advice, they
were forc'd to undertake it as a Point of Reli|gion;
and accordingly &s;ent an Army under the

But the <HI>Spartans</HI> happening to intercept them,
would accept of no other Ran&s;om, than that

<P>I. <HI>GREECE</HI> was no &s;ooner &s;ettled un|der
her &s;everal new Forms of Go|vernment,
but the whole Power of
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> threatned her with unavoidable De&s;tructi|on.
This was the famous <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> War; where|in
<PB N="176" REF="207">
tho' <HI>Athens</HI> was principally concern'd, the
other States were oblig'd for their common In|tere&s;t
and Safety to unite, as they did in the
<HI>Trojan</HI> War: And as that fir&s;t general Expedi|tion
put an end to the <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> &s;o
did this to its <HI>Minority.</HI> But before we pa&s;s

<HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> with the mo&s;t remarkable Tran&s;|actions
that happen'd before the coming down
of the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> being chiefly &s;uch as contribu|ted
towards it.</P>
<P>The Regal Power was no &s;ooner aboli&s;h'd in
<HI>Athens,</HI> but the People wre&s;ted too great a
Share of the Government into their Hands: So
that things were carry'd by Tumult and Facti|on;
and they were &s;eldom free from as great,
or wor&s;e Di&s;orders, than. tho&s;e they complain'd
of under their Kings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clisthenes <HI>and</HI> I&s;agras.</NOTE> The fir&s;t Conte&s;t after
the Expul&s;ion of the <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratidae,</HI> was between
<HI>Cli&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Isagoras,</HI> two principal Men
of the City, who were both gra&s;ping at the fame
Power, which they had &s;o lately been very in|&s;trumental
in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing. <HI>Cli&s;thenes</HI> finding his
Party too weak to carry it with a high Hand,
fell in with the People, and from an Invader
of their Liberties, &s;et up for a Patriot. To
this end he chang'd the Names of the Tribes,
encrea&s;ing the Number from four to ten; and
added an hundred to the <HI>Council of four hun|dred,</HI>
ordering fifty to be cho&s;en annually out
of each Tribe. But his mo&s;t popular Act was
the O&s;traci&s;m;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The O&s;traci&s;m.</HI></NOTE> which by fome is carry'd as
high <HI>Theseus;</HI> but more generally granted to
have been introduc'd about this time, and
a&s;crib'd to <HI>Clisthenes</HI> as the Author, who is al&s;o
recorded as the fir&s;t Example of his own Law.
<PB N="177" REF="208">
The manner of performing it was, that every
Citizen not under &s;ixty Years old &s;hould give
in a Name written upon a <HI>Tile</HI> or <HI>Oy&s;ter-&s;hell,</HI>
(from whence it had its Name) and he, upon
whom the Majority fell, was pronounc'd ba|ni&s;h'd
for ten Years. The Pretence of this
In&s;titution was not to puni&s;h tho&s;e as Offenders,
who had de&s;erv'd well of the State, but only to
blunt the Edge of Envy by removing the Ob|ject;
and for this rea&s;on their E&s;tates were pre|&s;erv'd
intire for them 'till their Return. But
the real De&s;ign was to take off all &s;uch as for
Reputation., Quality, Riches, or Eloquence
were e&s;teem'd above the common Level: Which
was a barbarous Di&s;couragement to all &s;orts of
Merit and Ambition, and yet judg'd nece&s;&s;ary
in a State, where all were to be of equal Credit
and Authority. And therefore it obtain'd not
only in <HI>Athens,</HI> but al&s;o in <HI>Argos, Megara,
Miletus,</HI> and <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> tho' under different
Names, and with &s;everal Re&s;trictions. The
la&s;t who &s;uffer'd this way, was <HI>Hyperbolus</HI>
an idle ra&s;cally Fellow, who made it his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to furni&s;h Scandal for the Stage, and was
made u&s;e of by the People, as a nece&s;&s;ary Tool
to a&s;per&s;e Men of Intere&s;t and Reputation. It
happen'd that <HI>Alcibiades, Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Phaeax</HI>
being of different Factions, and bearing a great
Sway in the State, lay open to the Envy of
the inferior Citizens; who therefore would
have one of them bani&s;h'd. Which they ha|ving
notice of, united their Parties, and turn'd
the O&s;traci&s;m upon <HI>Hyperbolus,</HI> who had &s;et the
People again&s;t 'em. But this was thought &s;uch
a Contempt put upon the Thing, that upon his
Account it was laid a&s;ide. I&s;agoras being by
<PB N="178" REF="209">
the&s;e Methods over-power'd at home, betook
him&s;elf to <HI>Cleomenes</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King, with
whom he had contracted an Intimacy during the
War with <HI>Hippias.</HI> He e&s;pous'd his Quarrel,
and having got <HI>Cli&s;thenes,</HI> and the Heads of his
Party bani&s;h'd the City, march'd thither with
an Army, and expell'd &s;even hundred Families
more of tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t likely to make
head again&s;t him, but did it under a Pretence
of their not having expiated the Death of <HI>Cy|lon.</HI>
His next Attempt was to di&s;&s;olve the
Senate, and commit the Admini&s;tration to three
hundred of <HI>I&s;agoras</HI>'s Faction: But this being
&s;trongly oppos'd both by Senate, and People,
he &s;eiz'd the Ca&s;tle, where he &s;uffer'd him&s;elf
for two days to be be&s;ieg'd. On the third <HI>I&s;a|goras,</HI>
and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> with his <HI>Spartans</HI> had
leave to depart; but the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who had
been a&s;&s;i&s;ting in this Enterprize, were impri&s;on'd,
and put to Death. After which <HI>Cli|&s;thenes</HI>
with the &s;even hundred Families was re|call'd;
who finding it not &s;afe to make any fur|ther
Attempts upon the Liberty of <HI>Athens,</HI> re|&s;tor'd
the <HI>Democracy,</HI> as &s;ettled by <HI>Solon.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Athenians</HI> knowing how they had
incens'd the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Athe|nians <HI>seek Alliance with</HI> Per|&s;ia.</NOTE> thought it nece&s;&s;a|ry
to be upon their Guard, and therefore &s;ent
to enter into Alliance with the <HI>Persian,</HI> who
made that a Pretence to demand of 'em <HI>Earth</HI>
and <HI>Water,</HI> the u&s;ual Tokens of Homage and
Subjection, by which was yielded up the So|vereignty
and Propriety of all included in tho&s;e
Elements. The Amba&s;&s;adors finding they
would not treat with them upon any other
Terms, con&s;ented to it, but were mightily
blam'd at their Return, as having acted &s;o much
<PB N="179" REF="210">
below the Dignity of the State: And indeed
this &s;ervile Compliance may be con&s;ider'd as
one remote Cau&s;e of the <HI>Per&s;ian De&s;cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cleomenes</HI> in the mean while was levying
Forces to make another Attempt in behalf of
<HI>I&s;agoras;</HI> with which he march'd into <HI>Attica,</HI>
having contracted with the <HI>Boeotians</HI> and <HI>Chal|cidians</HI>
of <HI>Euboea</HI> to &s;econd his Attack in other
Places at the &s;ame time. The <HI>Athenians</HI> thus
di&s;tre&s;s'd on all Sides, cho&s;e fir&s;t to meet the
<HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> lying in <HI>Eleu&s;is;</HI> and ju&s;t as they
were making up to them, the <HI>Corinthians</HI> mov'd
with the Inju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e drew off,
and were &s;econded by <HI>Demaratus</HI> the other <HI>Spar|tan</HI>
King. The re&s;t following their Example,
the whole Army was di&s;pers'd without any
Action. But the <HI>Athenians</HI> reek'd their Re|venge
upon the <HI>Boeotians,</HI> killing and taking
many of 'em Pri&s;oners; and pa&s;&s;ing over the
&s;ame Day into <HI>Euboea,</HI> did the like by the <HI>Chal|cidians.</HI>
The <HI>Thebans</HI> in this Extremity contracted
a League with <HI>Aegina,</HI> a &s;mall I&s;land, but ve|ry
rich, powerful at Sea, and a profe&s;s'd Ene|my
to <HI>Athens.</HI> While the <HI>Aeginetans</HI> were in|fe&s;ting
the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Attica,</HI> the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
took this Opportunity to renew their Quarrel
with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whom, &s;ince the Recove|ry
of their Liberty had put'em into a flouri&s;h|ing
Condition, they began to look upon as Ri|vals.
The be&s;t way of reducing 'em, they
thought would be to place a Tyrant over them;
and finding they could do no good with <HI>I&s;ago|ras,</HI>
they &s;ent for <HI>Hippias,</HI> with a De&s;ign to re|in&s;tate
him: But debating the Matter among
their Con&s;ederates, it was violently oppos'd,
particularly by <HI>So&s;icles</HI> a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> who in|veighing
<PB N="180" REF="211">
again&s;t this, and all other Sorts of Ty|ranny,
nothing more was done in it. So that
<HI>Hippias</HI> return'd into <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and having got an
Intere&s;t in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court, made it his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to incen&s;e them again&s;t <HI>Athens,</HI> in hopes by
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to be re&s;tor'd: And he &s;o far
prevail'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Grounds of the</HI> Per&s;ian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> that when the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;ent to vin|dicate
their Proceedings, telling 'em, <HI>That</HI> Hip|pias,

Credit, or Countenance among them,</HI> the Answer
they receiv'd, was, <HI>That if they would be &s;afe,
they mu&s;t admit</HI> Hippias. <HI>Athens</HI> having &s;o
lately thrown off the Yoke, had too lively a
Sen&s;e of her pa&s;t Calamities, to accept the Con|dition,
and re&s;olv'd rather to &s;uffer the la&s;t Ex|tremity,
than open her Gates again to a Ty|rant.
Which Re&s;u&s;al is to be con&s;ider'd as a
principal Circum&s;tance in the Quarrel between

<P>II. But to &s;et the&s;e Affairs in a clear Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Affairs of the Le&s;|&s;er A&s;ia</HI></NOTE>. we mu&s;t begin our Account of 'em in <HI>Ionia,</HI>
where the War was kindled, and from whence
it &s;pread in its Progre&s;s, and was never through|ly
extingui&s;h'd, but in the intire Subver&s;ion of
the <HI>Per&s;ian Monarchy.</HI> The <HI>Ionians</HI> with the
<HI>Aeolians, Carians,</HI> and others &s;tretching along
the Sea-Coa&s;t of the <HI>Lower A&s;ia,</HI> came to form
a very Con&s;iderable Body of M$n, a$d went un|der
the general Name of the <HI>A&s;iatick Grecians,</HI>
being govern'd chiefly by their own Laws, with
a full Enjoyment of their Liberty for about
five hundred Years from their fir&s;t &s;ettling in
tho&s;e Parts. After which they were over|topp'd
by the Growth of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and made Tri|butary
to <HI>Croe&s;us&punc;</HI> who &s;ubdu'd 'em; 'till <HI>Ly|dia</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="212">
it &s;elf &s;oon after falling into the Hands of
the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> they were al&s;o a&s;&s;ign'd over with it,
as a Part of the <HI>Lydian</HI> Territory, having Go|vernors
plac'd over their &s;everal Cities, whom
they call'd their Tyrants. But as an half-con|quer'd
People, they were ready upon all Oc|casions
to rebel, and made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful
Struggles both in <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s time, and after him:
The <HI>Ionians</HI> particularly, who bore the great|e&s;t
Sway among 'em, and made as remarkable a
Figure as any of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Colonies, could
not brook this being &s;h$fted about from one to
another, and therefore let no Advantage &s;lip,
which they could hope to improve into the
Recovery of their Liberty.</P>
<P>That which favour'd their De&s;igns at this
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darius <HI>hi$</HI> Scythian <HI>Expedi|tion</HI></NOTE>. was an Expedition of <HI>Darius Hy&s;ta&s;pes</HI>
the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King, again&s;t the <HI>Scythians:</HI> In or|der
to which he had laid a Bridge over the
<HI>I&s;ter,</HI> and tran&s;ported a numerous Army, lea|ving
the <HI>Ionians,</HI> and their Neighbours at the
Bridge, to &s;ecure his Retreat, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him
with their Shipping. Whil&s;t, <HI>Darius</HI> was ad|vanc'd
into the Country, the <HI>Ionians</HI> fi$ding
him, and his whole Army at their Di&s;po&s;al,
fell into a Debate, whether they &s;hould exe|cute
their Charge, or by breaking down the
Bridge, leave them to the Fury of the Enemy.
Be&s;ides their own Inclinations for the latter,
the <HI>Scythians</HI> per&s;uaded 'em to return home;
a&s;&s;uring 'em, that <HI>Darius</HI> would never more be
in a Capacity of doing 'em Good or Harm.
But the chief Encourager of this Motion, was
the famous <HI>Miltiades</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI> de&s;cended
from <HI>Codrus,</HI> who&s;e Ance&s;tors had retir'd du|ring
the Tyranny of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> and left him
<PB N="182" REF="213">
at this time in the Government of the <HI>Thracian
Cher&s;one&s;us.</HI> He repre&s;ented the Ea&s;ine&s;s, and
Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Action, telling 'em,
<HI>This was their time to free them&s;elves from the</HI>
Per&s;ian <HI>Yoke.</HI> And they had certainly follow'd
his Advice, if <HI>Hi&s;tiaeus,</HI> Tyrant of <HI>Miletus</HI> a
principal City of <HI>Ionia,</HI> had not &s;trongly oppo|&s;ed
it, urging to the other Tyrants, <HI>That their
Power was too precarious to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of it &s;elf, un|le&s;s
&s;upported by the King their Ma&s;ter; and that
therefore their Safety depended intirely upon his.</HI>
Which Argument &s;way'd &s;o much with 'em,
that the Project fell; and <HI>Darius</HI> being oblig'd
to retire out of <HI>Scythia,</HI> they conducted him
&s;afe into <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Who, that he might make up
in one Country, the Lo&s;&s;es he &s;u&s;tain'd in ano|ther,
left <HI>Megabyzus</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> with eighty
thou&s;and Men to reduce <HI>Thrace,</HI> and other Ma|ritime
Places; after which he thought <HI>Mace|don</HI>
would fall of Cour&s;e. This General &s;oon
executed the King's Order; and then di&s;patch'd
&s;even principal Men of the Army to <HI>Amyntas.</HI>
King of <HI>Macedon,</HI> to demand Earth and Wa|ter.
Who doubting his own Strength, not on|ly comply'd
with their Demands, but gave 'em
a &s;plendid Entertainment, in the heighth of
which, when they were heated with Wine,
they de&s;ir'd <HI>Amyntas</HI> to crown &s;o magnificent
a Fea&s;t with the u&s;ual Freedoms of Gallantry,
and that as an Earne&s;t of their being Welcome,
the Wives and Daughters of the <HI>Macedonians</HI>
might be admitted into the Company. No
&s;ooner were the Ladies come into the Room,
but the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> behav'd them&s;elves with great
Immode&s;ty towards them: Upon which <HI>A|lexander,

regard of his Age and Gravity to retire, and
leave him to keep 'em within Bounds, or el&s;e
to cha&s;ti&s;e their In&s;olence. Accordingly he
takes the Women out of the Room, under Pre|tence
of dre&s;&s;ing 'em up to appear more agree|able,
and in their &s;tead brings in the &s;ame Num|ber
of young Men in Female Apparel with
Daggers under their Cloaths; who watching

call'd to Account for Mi&s;management. His fir&s;t
Step was to abandon his own Tyranny; where|by
having &s;ufficiently oblig'd the <HI>Mile&s;ians,</HI>
they a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in procuring the &s;ame Liber|ty
for the other Cities: By which plau&s;ible
Methods he &s;oon had the whole Country at

were gone too far to retreat, re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h
on their Fortunes without them: And having

<HI>Hi&s;tiaeus</HI> finding things grown to a head,

and tru&s;ted him with a Commi&s;&s;ion to go and
pacific the Troubles in <HI>Ionia.</HI> But when he
came to <HI>Sardis, Artaphernes</HI> could not forbear
taxing him as the Incendiary, telling him plain|ly,
<HI>That the Shoe, which</HI> Ari&s;tagoras <HI>had put on,
was of his making.</HI> So that finding him&s;elf
detected, he knew not where to fix, but kept in

had acted on both Sides, was not ea&s;ily tru&s;ted
by either; neither would his old Friends the

had at this time need enough of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.
For the War being pretty well over in other

were employ'd again&s;t <HI>Miletus.</HI> The <HI>Mile|&s;ians</HI>
had no Land Army to oppo&s;e 'em: But
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Neighbours, parti|cularly
the <HI>Chians, Lesbians,</HI> and <HI>Samians,</HI> they
furni&s;h'd out a Fleet of between three and four

chi$fly of <HI>Phaenicians, Cyprians, Aegyptians</HI> and
<HI>Cilicians;</HI> and tho' they had the Superiority by

thought it more advi&s;eable to treat with the &s;e|veral

to draw off their Citizens, than to hazard an
Engagement. While they were managing this

<P>III. <HI>Darius,</HI> whil&s;t he was &s;ettling the Tri|bute,

on that Side with various Succe&s;s: So
that the End of this War was in effect but the
Beginning of that long Train of Evils, which
he brought upon him&s;elf, and his Succe&s;&s;ors.
Two Years after the taking of <HI>Miletus,</HI> he
withdrew the Commi&s;&s;ions of his late Captains,
and &s;ent in their room <HI>Mardonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mardoni|us.</NOTE> who had mar|ry'd
his Daughter, with a good &s;ufficient Fleet

to keep the Inhabitants firm to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> In|tere&s;t,
he di&s;&s;olv'd all the Tyrannies, and re&s;tor'd
the <HI>Democracy.</HI> His next Expedition was
with his Fleet again&s;t <HI>Tha&s;os,</HI> a rich I&s;land o|ver
again&s;t <HI>Thrace,</HI> the Land Forces being em|ploy'd
at the &s;ame time in reducing the other
Parts of <HI>Macedon,</HI> which had not yet declar'd
for his Ma&s;ter. Having been thus far &s;ucce&s;sful,
he coa&s;ted along by Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> where
he met with &s;uch a violent Storm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fruit|le&s;s Expe|dition.</NOTE> that he lo&s;t
three h$ndred of his Ve&s;&s;els, and in 'em above
twenty thou&s;and Men. It happen'd ju&s;t after
that the Foot being quarter'd in <HI>Macedon,</HI> the
<HI>Brygi,</HI> a People of <HI>Thrace,</HI> &s;ell upon 'em by

And tho' he &s;oon rally'd, and &s;ubdu'd 'em, he
dur&s;t not pur&s;ue his Conque&s;ts, but return'd
home with his &s;hatter'd Fleet, and the Remains
of his Army.</P>
<P>The&s;e Succe&s;&s;es did &s;o little an&s;wer the Lo&s;s
of &s;o many Ships and Men, that they &s;erv'd
<PB N="189" REF="220">
rather to incen&s;e, than &s;atisfie <HI>Darius,</HI> and
made him re&s;olve to &s;end Force enough the
next Year to do the Bu&s;ine&s;s effectually. He
began now to declare him&s;elf ob&s;tinately bent
upon the Conque&s;t of <HI>Greece;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The more immediate Grounds of the</HI> Per&s;ian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> to which Re&s;o|lution
many Circum&s;tances concurr'd. Ever
&s;ince the burning of <HI>Sardis</HI> he had vow'd Re|venge
upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and order'd one every
time he &s;ate down to Table, to cry out, <HI>Sir, Re|member
the</HI> Athenians. He could much ea&s;ier
have pardon'd the <HI>Ionians,</HI> tho' they were the
principal Aggre&s;&s;ors, as not thinking they would
have dar'd to attempt any thing again&s;t him,
but at the In&s;tigation of tho&s;e, who&s;e Igno|rance,
or Contempt of his Power might encou|rage
'em to provoke him. As for the I&s;landers,
they had furni&s;h'd out a great Number of
Ships again&s;t him: And the Pretence of
ma|king it a national Quarrel, was, that they had
all in general given his Rebels free Harbour.
To add to which, <HI>Hippias</HI> was always at hand
to aggravate the&s;e Matters, that being the on|ly
means left him to recover his Tyranny. Not
but the Bu&s;ine&s;s was likely enough to have
proceeded without him. For the Noi&s;e the
principal States of <HI>Greece</HI> began now to make in
the World, could not but alarm the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Greatne&s;s: And <HI>Darius</HI> in the beginning of his

&s;everal as Spies under the Conduct of <HI>De|mocedes,</HI>
to take an exact Survey of the Coun|try.</P>
<P>In order therefore to this intended Inva&s;ion,
he fir&s;t try'd how the &s;everal Cities &s;tood af|fected,
&s;ending to 'em all to demand Earth and
Water; but at the &s;ame time gave Orders to
<PB N="190" REF="221">
the Cities upon the Sea-coa&s;ts to build long
Ships, and flat-bottom'd Boats, for the Tran|&s;portation
of Hor&s;e. The <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> and
<HI>Athenians,</HI> threw the Me&s;&s;engers into deep Pits,
telling 'em, <HI>There was Earth and Water to car|ry
to their Ma&s;ter.</HI> He who advis'd this, was
&s;aid to be <HI>Miltiades;</HI> who be&s;ides his being an
<HI>Athenian,</HI> had a per&s;onal Pique again&s;t the
<HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> for forcing him from his Government
of the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> when they had invaded the
<HI>Thracian</HI> Territories. The <HI>aeginetans</HI> with
&s;ome other I&s;lands comply'd; and were there|upon
accus'd by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> as having be|tray'd
the Liberty of their Country, only for
an Opportunity of fighting them to Advan|tage.
The Matter was heard, and re&s;ented at
<HI>Sparta;</HI> and <HI>Cleomenes</HI> went immediately to
<HI>Aegina</HI> to puni&s;h the Heads of the Revolt:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some Com|motions at</HI> Sparta.</NOTE>
But he had at that time a Difference with his
Collegue <HI>Demaratus,</HI> who under-hand defeated
his De&s;igns. <HI>Cleomenes</HI> to be reveng'd of him, at
his Return us'd his utmo&s;t Efforts to get him
depos'd; and the Pretence was his being ille|gitimate.
It &s;eems <HI>Ari&s;ton,</HI> the Father of <HI>Demaratus,</HI>
having no Children by two Wives,
took a third, who was already marry'd to one
of his Friends, which was allowable according
to <HI>Lycurgus's</HI> Laws: And having this Son by
her in &s;even Months after Marriage, he &s;wore
it was none of his. But for fear the Line of
<HI>procles</HI> &s;hould fail, the State took no notice of
it, and he own'd the Child, leaving him Suc|ce&s;&s;or
to his Crown and Virtues, he being no|ted
as the fir&s;t <HI>Spartan</HI> King, who conquer'd
in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games. But upon this Con|test
between the two Kings, the old Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="191" REF="222">
of Ba&s;tardy was trump'd up, and the Oracle
was to decide it. The <HI>Pythia</HI> being corrupted
by <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> gave it again&s;t <HI>Demaratus:</HI> So
that this, and his former Retreat out of <HI>Attica,</HI>
which was the Grounds of the Quarrel, being
objected again&s;t him, he was dethron'd, and
&s;ucceeded by his Kin&s;man <HI>Leutychides. Demaratus,</HI>
tho' he expre&s;s'd a Love for his Country,
went over to the <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> by whom he was
ea&s;ily receiv'd at this Juncture, and entertain'd
with all the Honour due to his Character. As
for <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> he was $s;oon after detected; and
being &s;truck with Remor&s;e for the Inju&s;tice he
had done his Collegue, in a fit of a Phrenzy
rip'd up his own Belly. Nor did it fare much
better with <HI>Leutychides,</HI> who afterwards prov'd
a Traitor to his Country, and being convicted
of Bribery, dy'd in Exile.</P>
<P>But he with <HI>Cleomenes</HI> had fir&s;t taken ten of
the principal Men of <HI>Aegina,</HI> and left 'em as
Ho&s;tages at <HI>Athens.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The War with Aegi|na.</HI></NOTE> Which the <HI>Aeginetans</HI>

intercepted a Ship going to <HI>Delos,</HI> (ac|cording

<HI>Theseus's</HI> time) and in it the principal Men of
<HI>Athens,</HI> whom, by way of Repri&s;al, they made
Pri&s;oners. Which &s;o incens'd the <HI>Athenians,</HI>
that they mann'd out &s;eventy Gallies, and a|greed
at the &s;ame time to have the City of
<HI>Aegina</HI> betray'd to 'em: But the Fleet coming
up too late to &s;econd the Attempt by Land,
that De&s;ign mi&s;carry'd. However the Flects
engag'd, and the <HI>Aeginetans</HI> were wor&s;ted: But
being reinforc'd, they ventur'd another Battel,
and got the better. This War &s;eems to have
been of a longer Continuance, tho' we have very
<PB N="192" REF="223">
little Light into the Particulars: But we may
ob&s;erve in general, that the&s;e civil Di&s;cords,
which &s;eem'd to favour the De&s;igns of the
common Enemy, did in a great mea&s;ure procure
the Safety of <HI>Greece,</HI> by putting the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
upon the Study of Sea-Affairs, and by
that means preparing them for the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> So
that they easily wre&s;ted the Sovereignty of the
Seas from the I&s;landers, and particularly the
<HI>Aeginetans,</HI> who had held it twenty Years;
and that at a time when the Eyes and Hopes
of all <HI>Greece</HI> were upon them, and when they
could have done very little without it.</P>
<P>IV. Whil&s;t the <HI>Athenians</HI> were engag'd in
this War, <HI>Darius</HI> pro&s;ecuted his De&s;igns upon
<HI>Greece:</HI> And having levy'd an Army of an
hundred thou&s;and Foot according to the low|e&s;t
Computation, (for <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> reckons &s;ix times
as many) and ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e, gave the
chief Command to <HI>Datis</HI> a <HI>Mede,</HI> in the room
of <HI>Mardonius,</HI> under whom the Fleet had mi&s;|carry'd,
appointing <HI>Artaphernes</HI> his Brother's
Son, and <HI>Hippias</HI> as his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and giving
them an expre&s;s Command to bring the <HI>Athenians</HI>
and <HI>Eretrians</HI> Pri&s;oners to him, and to
lay wa&s;te their Country. Accordingly they
embark'd in &s;ix hundred Gallies, be&s;ides Tran|&s;ports
for the Hor&s;e: And directly cro&s;&s;ing the
<HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of <HI>Samos,
Naxos, Delos,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Cyclades</HI> to
&s;ecure their Pa&s;&s;age. From thence they <HI>&s;ail'd</HI>
to <HI>Euboea;</HI> where the <HI>Eretrians,</HI> tho' the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
had lent 'em four thou&s;and Men, thought
it more advi&s;eable to &s;end 'em home, and keep
within their Walls, than to offer Battel to &s;uch

attempted to &s;torm the City, and were repul&s;ed

into their Hands, they enter'd, plunder'd and
burnt it. From thence <HI>Hippias</HI> conducted them
into <HI>Attica;</HI> and they encamp'd in the Plains of

<HI>Athenians</HI> having notice of their March, and be|ing

&s;eem'd very willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t, 'em; but being to
be detain'd four Days upon a religious Ac|count,
it was debated among the <HI>Athenians,
Whether they &s;hould wait for a Summons from
the Enemy, as the</HI> Eretrians <HI>did, within their
Walls, or go out to meet 'em. Miltiades</HI> earne&s;t|ly
pre&s;s'd the latter, and with much Difficulty
prevail'd. Accordingly they took the Field
with only nine thou&s;and of their own Men,
and one thou&s;and <HI>Plataeans.</HI> Each Captain a&s;|&s;ignd
his Day of Command to <HI>Miltiades,</HI> who
had by this means the whole Management of
the Battel.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel of</HI> Mara|thon.</NOTE> He cho&s;e to put the I&s;&s;ue of it up|on
his own Day; and having di&s;pos'd the Ar|my
into two Wings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> and a main Body, led 'em
on with &s;uch Fury and Precipitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3514.</NOTE> that the
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> thought they were rather to be laugh'd
at as Madmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 72. 3</NOTE> than dreaded as Enemies. But
being ingaged, and con&s;idering their <HI>All</HI> was at
Stake, that therefore they mu&s;t either die, or
conquer, De&s;pair added to their natural Cou|rage,
and they held the Victory long in Su&s;|pence.
And tho' the main Bettel was forc'd
to give way to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Numbers, both the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Wings prevail'd, which gave 'em an
<PB N="194" REF="226">
Opportunity of relieving the rest. Which they
did &s;o effectually, that tho' there was ten to
one again&s;t 'em, they &s;oon di&s;order'd and routed
the Enemy, and gain'd a Victory, which had
more of Truth in it, than Probability. for
they pur&s;u'd 'em to their very Ships, &s;everal
of which they took: And as an In&s;tance of the
Ob&s;tinacy, with which the <HI>Grecians</HI> fought,
<HI>Cynagirus</HI> held a Gally full of <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> with his
Right Hand, to keep it from putting off from
Shore; which was no &s;ooner lopp'd off, but he
&s;eiz'd it with his left, and lo&s;ing that too, he
fix'd his Teeth in it, and expir'd. As to the
Number of the Slain, <HI>Herodotus</HI> reckons &s;ix
thou&s;and four hundred <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and but one
hundred ninety two of the <HI>Grecians;</HI> among
whom were few Officers of Note, but <HI>Calli|machus,</HI>
who commanded the Right Wing.
<HI>Hippias</HI> is thought to have fell in this Battel;
tho' <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;ays he e&s;cap'd, and dy'd misera|bly
in <HI>Lemnos.</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;ians immediately retir'ed into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
having nothing to cover their Di&s;grace but
their Pri&s;oners, whom they took in <HI>Eretria.</HI>
The&s;e were pre&s;ented to <HI>Darius</HI> at <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> and
&s;ettled near the <HI>Tigris</HI> upon much better Terms
than they could expect: So that they, and their
Po&s;terity flouri&s;h'd in a Body for &s;everal Ages,
and retain'd their Language. Two thou&s;and of
the <HI>Spartans,</HI> (who&s;e Laws would not permit
'em to &s;tir 'till the full of the Moon) came at
la&s;t into the Field: But the Action being over,
they &s;erv'd only to te&s;tifie, and extol the Bra|very
of their Countrymen. Among whom
<HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> tho' very young, did enough to
&s;ignalize him&s;elf, and gave an early Promi&s;e of
what might one Day be expected from him.

&s;et fire to his Works, and return'd home. This

that <HI>To whatever Cau&s;e his ill Succe&s;s in</HI> Scy|thia

<HI>had given them too fre&s;h, and fatal an In|&s;tance

as a de&s;picable People: That he ought therefore
to be well advis'd in an Affair of &s;uch Moment,
that &s;o he might at lea&s;t justifie his Conduct, tho'
he could not warrant the Succe&s;s. Xerxes</HI> told

Thoughts, he &s;eem'd better reconcil'd to his Un|cle's

of his De&s;ign; which in four Years he at la&s;t
compleated. The Hor&s;e were commanded by
the Sons of <HI>Datis;</HI> and a &s;elect Body of ten

the <HI>Immortal Regiment,</HI> becau&s;e it was kept con|&s;tantly
&s;upply'd out of the re&s;t. But the gro&s;s

<PB N="200" REF="232">
who having the Princes of the Blood join'd
with him as A&s;&s;i&s;tants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His March.</HI></NOTE> commanded in chief.
The fir&s;t general Rendezvous of the Land-forces
was at <HI>Critalae;</HI> from whence pa&s;&s;ing the
River <HI>Hal$s,</HI> they march'd to <HI>Celaenae</HI> &agrave; City of
<HI>Phrygia,</HI> and winter'd at <HI>Sardis. Xerxes</HI> during
his Stay here &s;ent into <HI>Greece,</HI> to demand <HI>Earth</HI>
and <HI>Water;</HI> and the Fleet being come up to the
<HI>Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> he order'd a Pa&s;&s;age of a Mile
and an half long to be cut for it behind Mount
<HI>Athos,</HI> to avoid the Danger of Shipwrack, which
<HI>Mardonius</HI> before had &s;uffer'd by &s;ailing about.
In the beginning of the Spring he quitted <HI>Sar|dis;</HI>
and from an Eminence rais'd for that pur|po&s;e

whole Force by Sea and Land: Where he could
not forbear te&s;tifying his Pride and Joy to &s;ee

&s;oon after fell into the other Extremes of Pa&s;&s;ion,
and could not without Tears reflect, <HI>That
not one of &s;o many Thou&s;ands would be alive an
hundred Years after.</HI> This engag'd him in a
melancholy Di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Artabanus</HI> about the
Shortne&s;s and Miseries of Life; who from thence
took Occa&s;ion to in&s;inuate his Doubts, as he
did before, about the Succe&s;s of this Enter|pri&s;e&punc;
He urg'd the many Inconveniences he
had to &s;uffer, if not from the Enemy, at lea&s;t
from the Elements them&s;elves; that his having
no Port there &s;ufficient to &s;helter &s;uch a Fleet
upon any Accident, might prove very de&s;tru|ctive
to his Shipping; and that Plague, Fa|mine,
and Confu&s;ion were the nece&s;&s;ary Atten|dants
of &s;uch ungovernable Multitudes by Land.
<HI>Xerxes</HI> $word$ him in An&s;wer, <HI>That great Actions
were nece&s;&s;arily attended with &s;ome proportionable

Danger; and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to provide for
Accidents.</HI> So that whatever Opinion he had
of his Uncle's Wi&s;dom in other Matters, he
thought it too deliberate for the Camp, and
&s;ent him back as his Vice-Roy to <HI>Su&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>In order to his Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Europe,</HI> he had
laid a Bridge cro&s;s the <HI>Hele&s;pont,</HI> where it was
near a Mile over; which being broke down by
tempe&s;tuous Weather, he cut off the Heads of
the Workmen, order'd the Sea it &s;elf to be
whipp'd, as tho' it had rebell'd again&s;t its So|vereign,
and ca&s;t a pair of Fetters into it, in
token of its future Subjection.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His passage into</HI> Eu|rope.</NOTE> After which
he made two Bridges of Gallies ty'd together,
and &s;o well anchor'd, that they re&s;i&s;ted the
Winds; by which means the whole Army
pa&s;s'd over in &s;even Days and Nights. This
&s;eems to have been the fir&s;t In&s;tance of that
which afterwards became the common Method
of <HI>Caesar</HI> and others, to tran&s;port their Armies.
<HI>Xerxes</HI> being got into <HI>Europe,</HI> order'd the Fleet
to &s;ail on We&s;tward, and march'd him&s;elf with
the Land Forces through the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> ga|thering
&s;till more as he went; and encamp'd in
a va&s;t Plain near <HI>Dori&s;cus,</HI> and well water'd
with the Rive <HI>Hebrus,</HI> where he mu&s;ter'd, and
number'd the whole Army. But as Hi&s;torians
differ in nothing more than the Accounts of
Armies, &s;o here we may with more Ea&s;e col|lect
from &s;everal Circum&s;tances of their Pre|parations,

Army that ever appear'd in the Field, than
a&s;&s;ign any ju&s;t Number.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Ac|count of his Forces.</HI></NOTE> According to the
mo&s;t mode&s;t Computation, they amounted to
at lea&s;t &s;even hundred thou&s;and Men. <HI>Hero|dotus</HI>
reckons up &s;eventeen hundred thousand
<PB N="202" REF="234">
Foot, and eighty thou&s;and Hor&s;e; and makes
an Acce&s;&s;ion of about three hundred thou&s;and

hundred thou&s;and belonging to the Fleet, which
consisted of &s;omewhat above twelve hundred
long Gallies, be&s;ides three thou&s;and Tran&s;ports,
and Ships of Burden. So that the whole of
the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> Forces by Sea and
Land, he reckons at above two Millions and a
half; and allows at lea&s;t an equal Number of
Women, Eunuchs, Slaves and other Atten|dants.
This will ea&s;ily account for <HI>Plutarch,</HI>
and <HI>Isocrates,</HI> when they &s;ay five Millions fol|low'd
<HI>Xerxes</HI> into <HI>Greece;</HI> and thus it might be
affirm'd without an <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> that they drank
up &s;everal little Rivers in their March.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Greece</HI> in the mean while was suffici|ently
alarm'd at the&s;e Approaches,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Gre|cian <HI>Prepa|rations.</HI></NOTE> but not &s;o
as to abandon all hopes of diverting the Storm.
<HI>Demaratus</HI> the late <HI>Spartan</HI> King, who &s;eems
to have acted on both Sides, had from time to
time given his Countrymen notice of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s
De&s;igns and Motions: And upon his Pa&s;&s;age $$to
<HI>Europe,</HI> they &s;ummon'd a general Council in
the <HI>I&s;thmus;</HI> where they $word$&punc; $e&s;alv'd to
wave all private Quarrels, and join in the De|fence
of their common Liberty, at the &s;ame
time publi&s;hing their Intentions, of putting to
Death every tenth Man of tho&s;e, who went o|ver
to the Enemy. But this did not hinder
the greate&s;t part of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> with
other petty States, which lay mo&s;t expos'd, from
declaring for the <HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> e&s;pecially after the
ten thou&s;and Me$, who were &s;ent into <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI>
under the Conduct of <HI>Euaenetus</HI> the <HI>Spartan,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="235">
and <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> the <HI>Athenian,</HI> were return'd,
as not thinking them&s;elves able to protect them.
The <HI>Argives</HI> al&s;o being &s;ent to in this Extre|mity,
evaded their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by in&s;i&s;ting on
Terms, which could not be accepted: So that
partly out of Fear, and partly out of their in|veterate
Hatred to the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> they
held &s;ecret Intelligence with the Enemy. Thus
the Burden of the War lay chiefly upon the <HI>A|thenians,</HI>
and <HI>Lacedaemonians;</HI> who, when they
found the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> advanc'd through <HI>Thrace</HI> and
<HI>Macedon,</HI> re&s;olv'd in another Council to op|po&s;e

&s;ix thou&s;and Men under the Command of <HI>Leo|nidas</HI>
the famous <HI>Spartan</HI> King, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
Streights of <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> a narrow Pa&s;s between

<P>As to Sea Affairs, there was the &s;ame Di&s;|proportion

Recour&s;e to the I&s;landers, mo&s;t of which were
their Allies, and Colonies. <HI>Sicily</HI> was at that
time able to furni&s;h out as many Ships as all
<HI>Greece:</HI> But her Tyrant <HI>Gelon</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon
being declar'd Commander in chief. As for
<HI>Crete,</HI> &s;he had her Oracles fir&s;t to con&s;ult: And
the <HI>Corcyraeans,</HI> tho' they expre&s;s'd a Sen&s;e of
their common Danger, and hover'd about with
&s;ixty Sail, it was only with a De&s;ign to fall in
with the Conqueror. So that the chief De|pendance
at Sea was upon <HI>Athens;,</HI> who&s;e late
War with <HI>Aegina</HI> had put tho&s;e two States in
a Condition of de$ending the re&s;t. This Ge|nius
for Sea Affairs was very opportunely im|prov'd
by <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> who from a mean Ex|traction
became &s;o active and a&s;piring, as to
<PB N="204" REF="236">
complain at his fir&s;t Appearance in the World,
<HI>That the Trophies of</HI> Miltiades <HI>would not let him
&s;leep.</HI> He had Boldne&s;s enough to propo&s;e, and
Courage enough to execute any thing, that
might tend to his own, and his Country's Ho|nour.
For an In&s;tance of which, he got the
Mony, which was rais'd from the Mines, and
ought to have been divided among the People,
to be employ'd in Shipping: And &s;o, by the
<HI>Wooden Walls,</HI> which the Oracle advis'd the <HI>A|thenians</HI>
to tru&s;t to, he would have nothing un|der&s;tood,
but their Ships. By the&s;e means,
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet was encreas'd to near two
hundred Sail; and putting to Sea with the re&s;t
of the Confederates, making in all two hundred
and eighty, &s;tood over-again&s;t <HI>Artemi&s;ium</HI> to|wards
the North part of <HI>Euboea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> in the mean while drew down his nu|merous
Forces towards the Streights of <HI>Ther|mopylae,</HI>
but rather for Terror, and O&s;tentation,
than with thoughts of fighting. For finding
<HI>Leonidas</HI> ready to receive him, and his Men
unu&s;ually gay, arid unconcern'd, he &s;ent to let
them know, that <HI>If they would lay down their
Arms, he would receive them as Friends, and
Confederates, and be&s;tow upon them much richer,
and larger Countries, than what they now po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd.</HI>
They rejected his Offers with a be|coming
Scorn, telling him, <HI>They &s;hould have
Occa&s;ion for their Arms, whether as his Friends,
or Enemies; that they de&s;ir'd no Country, but
what they won by their Virtue and Valour, and
could maintain by the &s;ame Methods they got it.</HI>
Upon this the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to <HI>De|maratus,</HI>
asking him with an Air of Pity, and
Contempt. <HI>What it was his Countrymen pre|pos'd?
<PB N="205" REF="237">
Or, whether they could run fa&s;ter than
his Horses?</HI> He told him, <HI>He would find them
re&s;olv'd to fight it out to the la&s;t; and that not
a Man of them would &s;urvive his Country's Li|berty.</HI>
Agreeable to this was the An&s;wer of
<HI>Dieneces a Spartan;</HI> who being told, <HI>That the</HI>
Per&s;ian <HI>Darts would darken the very Sun: So
much the better,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>for then we &s;hall fight
in the Shade.</HI> From all which one might con|clude,
that Virtue was then going to give
Laws to Effeminacy, Rea&s;on to In&s;tinct, and
the Soul to the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> at la&s;t advanc&punc;'d with a Body of
<HI>Medes,</HI> ordering tho&s;e, who had lo&s;t any of their
Relations at the Battel of <HI>Marathon,</HI> to beat the
Enemy from this Po&s;t, and revenge their dead
Friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Action at</HI> Ther|mopylae.</NOTE> Accordingly they began the On&s;et,
but were repuls'd with great Lo&s;s. Then
mighty Numbers of raw undi&s;ciplin'd Fellows
march$d again&s;t them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> of whom a prodigious
Slaughter was made:<NOTE PLACE="marg">3524.</NOTE> Nor did the <HI>Immortal
Regiment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 75. $</NOTE> which was &s;ent to relieve them, come
off at a cheaper rate. The next day <HI>Xerxes</HI>
made a Detachment of the choice&s;t of his
Troops, with a Promi&s;e of large Rewards, if
they would break in upon them, and force the
Pa&s;s. Upon which they made a violent Charge,
but with no better Succe&s;s than before: For
the <HI>Grecians</HI> collected into a clo&s;e Body &s;tood
the Shock, and fill'd the way with <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Car|ca&s;&s;es:
So that being driven one upon another,
the Confu&s;ion, and con&s;equently the Slaughter
was the greater. Thus did they keep their
Ground for two Days; on the fir&s;t of which,
<HI>Xerxes</HI> was ob&s;erv'd to leap three times from
his Throne, whereon he was plac'd to &s;ee the
<PB N="206" REF="238">
Battel: And being the next Day under the
&s;ame Con&s;ternation, it happen'd that <HI>Ephialtes</HI>
a <HI>Trachinian,</HI> de&s;erted from the <HI>Grecians,</HI> to
&s;hew him a &s;ecret way over a Ledge of Moun|tains,
by which he might fall upon their Rear,
<HI>Leonidas</HI> being inform'd that twenty thou&s;and
of the Enemy had logd'd them&s;elves on the Top
of the Hills, advis'd his Companions to <HI>retire,
and re&s;erve them&s;elves for better Times, and the
future Safety of</HI> Greece; <HI>that for his own part,
he ow'd more to his Country, than to him&s;elf,
and that it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to fall in the pre&s;ent
Defence of it.</HI> Thus having di&s;mi&s;s'd all but
three hundred <HI>Spartans</HI> with &s;ome <HI>The&s;pians,</HI>
and <HI>Thebans,</HI> in all not a thou&s;and Men, <HI>Come,
Fellow-Soldiers,</HI> &s;ays he to them, <HI>Let us Dine
chearfully, as if we were to Sup together in the
other World.</HI> And indeed they could propo&s;e no|thing
more than to fulfil the Oracle, which had
declar'd the City, or King of <HI>Sparta</HI> mu&s;t fall;
at the &s;ame time to let the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> see, what
Value they &s;et upon their Liberty, and, as it
were, to revenge their own Deaths, before
they fell. Being thus animated, they &s;tudy'd
only haw to &s;ell their Lives as dear as they
could; and thinking Death to be no where
more honourably met with, than in the Ene|mies
Camp, they took the Advantage of the
Night, and made directly to the Royal Pavi|lion,
where endeavouring to &s;urpri&s;e the King,
they broke through the whole Camp, and kill'd,
or overthrew whatever oppos'd them. The
darkne&s;s of the Night added very much to the
Confu&s;ion of the Enemy, in&s;omuch that they
fell one upon another without Di&s;tinction of
Friend, or Foe, and rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Grecians,</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="239">
than defended them&s;elves. Thus did they
carry all before them, 'till Day-light di&s;cover|ing
the Smalne&s;s of their Numbers, they were
&s;urrounded by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who gall'd them
both in Flank and Rear; and even then not &s;o
much conquer'd, as tir'd with conquering, they
fell among va&s;t Heaps of the &s;laughter'd Ene|my,
leaving behind them the Example of an
Intrepidity never known before. The Body
of <HI>Leonidas</HI> was found, and nail'd to a Cro&s;s;
but his Memory was &s;ufficiently eterniz'd by
the Poets, and Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e Times, who
thought this might ea&s;ily pa&s;s for a Victory
on the <HI>Grecians</HI> Side, as well in re&s;pect of the
Action it &s;elf, wherein the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> lo&s;t twenty
thou&s;and Men, as of the Influence it after|wards
had on the Affairs of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Xerxes,</HI> tho' he had clear'd this Pa&s;&s;age,
was more inclin'd to try his Fortune at Sea,
than to proceed immediately into the Coun|try;
especially when <HI>Demaratus</HI> told him, that
<HI>Sparta</HI> alone was able to &s;end out near eight
thou&s;and more &s;uch Men, as tho&s;e who&s;e Va|lour
he had &s;o lately experienc'd. The <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI>
Fleet was come up to <HI>Sepias,</HI> a Promon|tory
of <HI>Magne&s;ia,</HI> to act in Concert with
the Land Forces; where by a Storm, which
la&s;ted three Days, they had lo&s;t four hun|dred
Men of War, be&s;ides Tran&s;ports, and
Ships of Burden, with a proportionable Num|ber
of Men, and Provi&s;ions. To repair which
Lo&s;s, they order'd two hundred more to take
a Compa&s;s, and &s;urpri&s;e the <HI>Grecians</HI> lying in
the Streights of <HI>Euboea;</HI> which was the &s;ame
Stratagem the Army made u&s;e of at <HI>Thermo|pylae,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="240">
and much about the &s;ame time, but with
far different Succe&s;s. For the <HI>Grecians</HI> by the
Advice of <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> &s;et fail by Night; and
&s;o by a Counter-&s;urpri&s;e fell in with them,
took, and &s;unk thirty, and forc'd the re&s;t to
Sea, where by &s;tre&s;s of Weather they were all
&s;unk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sea-fight at</HI> Artemi&s;i|um.</NOTE> and &s;tranded. Enrag'd at the&s;e Di&s;ap|pointments
they bore down the next Day with
their whole Fleet, and drawing up in the Form
of an Half-Moon, made an offer of Battel,
which the <HI>Grecians</HI> readily accepted; and by
the &s;ingular Valour of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who were
ju&s;t re-inforc'd with three and fifty Sail, main|tain'd
the Conflict with equal Lo&s;s on both
Sides, 'till Night forc'd them into Harbour.
But they were &s;o &s;hatter'd in the Engagement,
that they were forc'd to quit this Station in
order to refit; and e&s;pecially hearing that <HI>Leo|nidas</HI>
was cut off at <HI>Thermopylae</HI> they thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to retire further into <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> coming up with
their Fleet to <HI>Artemi&s;ium,</HI> invaded <HI>Euboea,</HI> and
the Neighbouring Coa&s;ts. <HI>Xerxes</HI> at the &s;ame
time march'd through <HI>Doris,</HI> and <HI>Phocis,</HI> ha|ra&s;&s;ing
the Country, and laying all wa&s;te before
him; and leaving a Detachment to rifle the
Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphi,</HI> he incamp'd with
the re&s;t in <HI>Boeotia.</HI> When the <HI>Athenians</HI> found
him advancing towards <HI>Attica,</HI> they would
have engag'd their Confederates to make head
again&s;t him: But they declin'd it, as giving all
for lo&s;t without the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> and placing their
only Confidence in the Defence of <HI>Peloponne|&s;us.</HI>
The <HI>Athenians</HI> thus abandon'd, put on
board their Wives, and Children, with their mo&s;t
valuable Goods, and tran&s;ported them to <HI>Troe|zene,

Aegina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xerxes <HI>en|ters</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and <HI>Salamis.</HI> After which <HI>Xer|xes</HI>

into <HI>Europe.</HI> Tho&s;e few Inhabitants who were
left, retir'd into the Cittadel, where literally
interpreting the Oracle of the <HI>Wooden Walls,</HI>
they fortify'd it as well as they could, with
Boards, and Pali&s;adoes; and having &s;tood the
fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault, were &s;o confident of Succe&s;s, that
rather than yield to any Terms, they &s;uffer'd
them&s;elves to be put to the Sword, the Ca&s;tle
taken, and the Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI> in it to be
burnt.</P>
<P>In this Exigency a Council was &s;ummon'd,
wherein after every one had propos'd what his
Fear, and Intere&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, it was re&s;olv'd
to defend the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> by Sea and Land. The
De&s;ign of which was chiefly to &s;ecure <HI>Laconia,</HI>
and therefore ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ented to by <HI>Eurybiades</HI>
the <HI>Spartan,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding the &s;ignal
Services of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> was appointed Ad|miral
of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Navy. For as <HI>Athens</HI> was
forc'd to yield to <HI>Sparta</HI> upon other Accounts,
&s;o neither did &s;he think this a time to di&s;pute
the Command at Sea. But when <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI>
found the <HI>Grecian</HI> Fleet withdrawing from <HI>Sa|lamis</HI>
he oppos'd it with &s;o much Heat, that
<HI>Eurybiades</HI> made an Offer of &s;triking him. <HI>Strike
if you will,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but hear what I &s;ay.</HI> He
then told 'em, <HI>Their chief Dependance mu&s;t be
upon their Shipping; that they were now in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the narrow Seas, which would &s;ufficiently
perplex the Enemy; and that the improving that
Advantage, was of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to their
Affairs.</HI> Again&s;t this it was objected, <HI>That the</HI>
Athenians <HI>were not upon an equal Foot with
<PB N="210" REF="242">
the</HI> Peloponne&s;ians, <HI>who&s;e Cities and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
were yet untouch'd:</HI> But <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> told 'em,

would &s;erve either to re-in&s;tate them at home, or
tran&s;port 'em to &s;ome flouri&s;hing Colony abroad,
leaving tho&s;e, who abandon' d 'em fir&s;t, to the
Fury of the Enemy.</HI> The fear of lo&s;ing their
chief Support, brought them over to his Opi|nion;
and the Re&s;ult of all was, that they
&s;hould prepare to receive the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> in the
<HI>I&s;thumus</HI> by Land, and in the Streights of <HI>Sala|mis</HI>
by Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> in the mean while marched down to|wards
the Sea to act in Conjunction with his
Fleet, which was come to <HI>Phal$rus</HI> the <HI>Athe|nian</HI>
Port: And whil&s;t he was concerting Mea|&s;ires
with his Officers, the <HI>Grecians</HI> Hearts a|gain
fail'd them; and thinking it downright
Madne&s;s to throw up one Country, in hopes of
recovering another, that was intirely lo&s;t, they
weigh'd Anchor, in order to make directly to
the <HI>I&s;thumus. Themi&s;tocles</HI> finding no Arguments
would prevail, had recour&s;e to Stratagem; and
di&s;patch'd <HI>Sicinus</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Captive, and there|fore
the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected, to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> to tell him
from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral, who &s;ecretly e|&s;pous'd
his Intere&s;t, <HI>That the</HI> Grecians <HI>were
preparing for Flight; and that if he &s;et upon them
in this Confu&s;ion, before they were di&s;pers'd, or
join'd by their Land-Army, he might at once de|&s;troy
their whole Fleet.</HI> This Bait was ea|&s;ily
&s;wallow'd; and two hundred Ships were
immediately &s;ent out to block up the Streights,
and Pa&s;&s;ages, 'till the re&s;t of the Fleet could
come up. It happen'd at this Juncture, that
<PB N="211" REF="243">
<HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> the Son of <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI> an <HI>Athenian,</HI>
with great difficulty arriv'd at <HI>Salamis</HI> from
<HI>Aegina,</HI> and gave them a full Account of the
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> De&s;igns, <HI>That they were at that time
actually hemming them in on all Sides, and that
there was no way left, but to fight it out.</HI> This
<HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> had beha$'d very well in the Battel of
<HI>Marathon;</HI> which with the other good Quali|ties
he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, ca&s;t too great a Shade
upon the ri&s;ing Glory of <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI> From
hence &s;prung an Emulation betwixt them,
which was daily encreas'd by the Difference
of their Tempers. For <HI>Arti&s;tides</HI> was grave,
con&s;tant, &s;edate, mild, open, &s;incere, and gene|rous,
and was particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the
Name of <HI>Ju&s;t;</HI> whereas the other was bold,
impetuous, cunning, un&s;ettled, enterpri&s;ing,
and popular. So that being naturally cut out
for tran&s;planting his Rival, he form'd a Party,
which bani&s;h'd him by the <HI>O&s;traci&s;m.</HI> And
&s;o great was the Power of Faction, and the Fear
of Tyranny at his Condemnation, that as they
were giving in their Suffrages, an illiterate Fel|low
comes to <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> with his Shell, and de|&s;ires
him to write <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> upon it. He ask'd
him, <HI>If</HI> Ari&s;tides <HI>had ever done him any In|jury?
Not in the lea&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he; <HI>neither do I
know the Man; but I am concerned to hear,
that he goes every where by the Name of</HI> Ju&s;t.
<HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> made him no An&s;wer, but return'd
his Shell with the In&s;cription of his own
Name. And at his Departure from the City,
he only pray'd, <HI>That the Time might never come,
when</HI> Athens <HI>&s;hould have Cau&s;e to remember
him.</HI> After three Years Exile he was recall'd,
for fear of his joining with the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> upon
<PB N="212" REF="244">
the Inva&s;ion of <HI>Attica.</HI> But he was &s;o far
from it, that before the Decree was pa&s;s'd for
his Return, he us'd all po&s;&s;ible Means to en|courage
his Countrymen in the Defence of their
Liberty; and afterwards gave an undoubted
Proof of his Zeal, by contributing towards the
Advancement of his greate&s;t Enemy, <HI>Themi&s;to|cles,</HI>
at lea&s;t &s;o far as it conduc'd to the com|mon
Security. This generous Conduct of his
gain'd too much upon <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> to let any
thing of Pa&s;&s;ion, or Re&s;erve interfere with the
Publick: So that he let him into all his De|&s;igns
and Projects, particularly this la&s;t of &s;uf|fering
him&s;elf to be &s;urrounded. After which
they us'd their Joint-Authority with the o|ther
Commanders to engage them to &s;tay:
Yet did they not perfectly a&s;&s;ent, 'till a Gally
of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which had de&s;erted from the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI>
came, and confirm'd all that <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> I$d
told them. When finding no way to e&s;cape,
but what they mu&s;t make through the Enemy,
they prepar'd for the Fight.</P>
<P>They had increas'd their Fleet to three hun|dred
and eighty Sail, be&s;ides Tenders, and o|ther
Ve&s;&s;els, tho' it yet bore no Proportion to
that of the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> who having repair'd the
Damages, they &s;u&s;tain'd by Shipwrack, and o|ther
ways, were in as good a Condition, as at
the fir&s;t. <HI>Xerxes</HI> from an Eminence on Shore,
where he was plac'd with his Secretaries about
him, to write down the Particulars of the Acti|on,
gave the Signal to <HI>Ariamenes</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Admiral: And <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> having animated
the <HI>Grecians</HI> for the Defence of all that was dear
to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Salamis.</NOTE> loo&s;ed from <HI>Salamis</HI> with great Re&s;o|lution
to meet him. The <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> in whom
<PB N="213" REF="245">
the Enemy confided mo&s;t, were oppos'd to the
<HI>Athenians:</HI> And their whole Fleet being drawn
up distinctly according to their &s;everal Nations,
kept their Stations very well in the open Seas;
but when they began to enter the Streights,
they gave the <HI>Grecians</HI> an Opportunity of exer|ting
their Skill, and Di&s;cipline, without being
able to u&s;e the only Advantage they had in their
Numbers. The Admiral, who led the Van,
fell in with great Fury, but was &s;unk at the
fir&s;t Charge; which created &s;uch a Terror,
and Confu&s;ion, that they immediately tack'd
about, and made to Sea; but were fiercely pur|&s;u'd
by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who took &s;ome, and di&s;a|bled
others, by bru&s;hing off their Oars, and
&s;triking them through with the Beaks of their
Ve&s;&s;els. To add to which, the <HI>Ionians,</HI> with
whom <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> had been tampering before
the Engagement, took this Occa&s;ion to draw off
from the Line of Battel. In the other Wing
the Conte&s;t was vigorous on both Sides, and
for &s;ometime doubtful, 'till the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and
<HI>Cyprians</HI> being driven on Shore, the <HI>Athenians</HI>
made head upon the re&s;t, who being not able
to bear the Shock, retir'd in &s;o great Di&s;order,
that they fell foul one of another. Tho&s;e
who kept the Sea, were pur&s;u'd, and wor&s;ted
by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Aeginetans,</HI> who
had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Streights of <HI>Attica,</HI> intercept|ed
others, as they were making to the Port.
By this means the <HI>Grecians</HI> obtain'd a great and
glorious Victory, having &s;unk above two'hundred
of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gallies, be&s;ides what they
took, and di&s;pers'd their whole Fleet, with the
Lo&s;s of only forty of their own Ships.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="246">
<HI>Xerxes</HI> a&s;toni&s;h'd at this Overthrow, and not
knowing what Mea&s;ures to take, <HI>Mardonius</HI> ac|co&s;ted

Lo&s;s, and laid the whole blame upon the Cowar|di&s;e

<HI>to his Glory; or if the Event prov'd otherwi&s;e, that
he would take it to him&s;elf, without any Reflection

very well receiv'd by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who thinking he
had done enough to vindicate his Honour in
the taking of <HI>Athens,</HI> which was the chief Pre|tence
of the War, prepar'd to march home at
the Head of his Army, leaving Part of it with

the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who lo&s;ing Sight of them, put
in at <HI>Andros</HI> one of the <HI>Cyclades;</HI> where it was
propos'd to break down the Bridge of Ships, and
hinder the Pa&s;&s;age of the Land Forces, in hopes
of cutting them off, or forcing them to an ad|vantageous
Peace, But <HI>Eurybiades,</HI> or, accor|ding
to <HI>Plutarch, Ari&s;tides</HI> ju&s;tly fearing, lea&s;t
the Enemy, if a Retreat were deny'd him,
might out of pare Nece&s;&s;ity turn Valiant, and

to &s;torm it; and having made a con&s;iderable
Breach, the whole Army enter'd, and bearing
down all before 'em, made &s;uch an incredible
Havock, that above a hundred thou&s;and <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
were put to the Sword. For <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI>
in regard of their Numbers, not thinking it
&s;afe to take any Pri&s;oners, would give no
Quarter. It is &s;aid, that of the three hundred
thou&s;and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who came into the Field,
there e&s;cap'd &s;carce three thou&s;and be&s;ides the

the highe&s;t Account of it, &s;ince it mentions

And therefore to perpetuate the Memo|ry

were again &s;ollicited by the <HI>Samians,</HI> to take
this Opportunity of putting out to Sea, whil&s;t
<PB N="224" REF="256">
the <HI>Ionians</HI> in general were well affected to
them, and would certainly come in, when they
&s;aw a Power likely to protect them. They
immediately fet Sail under the Conduct of
<HI>Leutychides</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Admiral, and <HI>Xanthip|pus</HI>
the <HI>Athenian:</HI> At who&s;e Approach the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
made to Land; and at <HI>Mycale</HI> a Promon|tory
of <HI>Ionia</HI> hal'd their Gallies on Shore, &s;hut|ting 'em
up with a Wall, and a deep Trench;
and on the other &s;ide they were cover'd by
&s;ixty thou&s;and Foot, who were left under the
Command of <HI>Tigranes</HI> to &s;ecure the Continent.
<HI>Leutychides</HI> made to Shore after them, and by
a publick Crier animated the <HI>Ionians</HI> to revolt:
After which he landed his Forces, and prepa|red
the next Day to &s;ight them. The <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
finding the <HI>Ionians</HI> wavering, di&s;arm'd the
<HI>Samians,</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Mile&s;ians</HI> to defend the Pa&s;|&s;ages
about <HI>Mycale,</HI> and &s;o di&s;pers'd the re&s;t,
that they &s;hould be in a manner oblig'd to
fight in Conjunction with the other Troops.
The <HI>Grecians</HI> drew up their Army in two Bo|dies;
the one con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and <HI>Corinthians,</HI> kept the Plain, whil&s;t the other
of <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> march'd over Hills and Pre|cipices,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Mycale.</NOTE>
to gain the highe&s;t Ground. The Bat|tel
being join'd, great Courage and Re&s;oluti|on
&s;hew'd on both Sides; and the Fortune of
the Day continu'd a great while doubtful, 'till
the <HI>Samians,</HI> and <HI>Mile&s;ians,</HI> took their Oppor|tunity

Field, before the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> could come
up to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: So that all the Share

were making a pretty regular Retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tigranes <HI>the</HI> Per&s;ian <HI>General kill'd.</HI></NOTE> There

their General: And as they fought with
a De&s;ire to retrieve the Honour of their Arms,
the <HI>Grecians</HI> lo&s;t a greater Proportion in this,
than in any other of the Engagements. This
Battel was fought on the Evening of the &s;ame
Day with that at <HI>Plataea;</HI> the News of which
Victory arriving in the Camp at <HI>Mycale</HI> before
the Engagement, contributed in a great mea|&s;ure
towards the Succe&s;s of it: So that it is
not material to inquire, whether <HI>Leutychides</HI>
had actually Intelligence from <HI>Plataea,</HI> or,
(which is mo&s;t probable from the va&s;t Di|&s;tance)
that he invented it as a Stratagem, to
make his Soldiers charge with the greater Vi|gour,
and Alacrity; &s;ince the bare Rumour had
this good Effect, and &s;ince the thing it &s;elf
happen'd accordingly.</P>
<P>To compleat this Victory, the <HI>Grecians</HI>
burnt the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ships in the Haven, and re|turn'd
with great Spoil to <HI>Samos;</HI> where they
receiv'd the <HI>Ionians,</HI> and <HI>Aeolians</HI> as their Con|federates.
And as they had once more freed

of their Liberty, they were continu'd in <HI>A&s;ia&punc;</HI>
After which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> return'd home,
leaving the <HI>Athenians</HI> to recover the <HI>Cher&s;one|&s;us</HI>
of <HI>Thrace.</HI> Accordingly they lay before
<HI>S$&s;tus,</HI> whither &s;ome of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had retir'd,
'till having &s;tarv'd them, they took the Town,
and hang'd the Governor. It being late in
the Year, they wintered here; and in the Spring
return'd with their Navy to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>Thus were the <HI>Grecians</HI> at la&s;t freed from
the Inva&s;ion of an Army no le&s;s ridiculous in
Succe&s;s, than terrible in Appearance, having,
like Locu&s;ts, overwhelm'd their Country for
two Years together. It was a Deliverance ra|ther
to be wi&s;h'd than hop'd for; &s;ince it could
not have been effected, but by &s;o many &s;ignal
Overthrows both by Sea and Land, in any one
of which a Mi&s;carriage mu&s;t have prov'd fatal
to all <HI>Greece.</HI> To account for this prodigious
Succe&s;s, we are to con&s;ider how the Di&s;&s;olu|tion
of the Regal Power had at this time $ir'd
the <HI>Grecians</HI> with the Thoughts of Liberty;
&s;o that it produc'd even in the private Sol|diers
&s;uch uncommon Notions of Honour, and
Re&s;olution, that they were harden'd beyond a
Sen&s;e of their Danger. And this per&s;onal Bra|very
was &s;o well directed by the Conduct, and
Vigilance of their Officers, that they generally
fought to Advantage, by drawing the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>
into Streights, and Pa&s;&s;es, &s;o that they could
not enlarge their Front, nor con&s;equently make
u&s;e of their Numbers. To add to which,
there was a profe&s;s'd Emulation among the &s;e|veral
States of <HI>Greece;</HI> which, tho' it created
&s;ome little Difficulties in adju&s;ting the bu&s;ine&s;s
of Precedency and Command, had certainly a
<PB N="227" REF="259">
good Effect as to the Publick, when it came
to Action, and had no Object to vent it &s;elf
upon, but the common Enemy. Yet would
not all the&s;e concurring Circum&s;tances have
prevail'd in &s;o eminent a Degree, if they had
not had to do with an Enemy, who was ju&s;t
their Rever&s;e, a &s;lavi&s;h confus'd Multitude,
and wrap'd up in a &s;lothful Security. The
<HI>Persians</HI> had before this Expedition lo&s;t all the
Captains of their Founder <HI>Cyrus;</HI> and with
them that Spirit and Di&s;cipline, which had given
them the Promi&s;e of a glorious, as well as an ex|ten&s;ive
Empire. So that they had nothing to
tru&s;t to but their Numbers; and even this
was &s;o far from proving an Advantage, that
they were a dead Weight, and a Burden to
them&s;elves, and &s;erv'd rather to encrea&s;e the
Fury of the Enemy, than to defeat it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Xerxes,</HI> he lay at <HI>Sardis</HI> expecting the
Event of the&s;e Battels, 'till finding it impo&s;|&s;ible
to retrieve &s;uch a long Train of Mi&s;car|riages,
he retir'd farther into his Country&punc;
Where we will leave him abandon'd to a Cour&s;e
of Riot and Luxury, without expatiating up|on
tho&s;e black Scenes of Ince&s;t, Sacrilege, and
Murder, which made the latter Part of his Reign
as notoriously &s;candalous at home, as the fir&s;t
Part of it had been trifling abroad; and which
at la&s;t occa&s;ion'd his being murder'd by his
own Subjects. It is &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve,
that whatever &s;ucce&s;sful Attempts were made
by the <HI>Persians</HI> in other Parts, neither <HI>Xerxes,</HI>
nor his Succe&s;&s;ors did ever after this Defeat at
<HI>Mycale,</HI> act offensively again&s;t <HI>Greece.</HI> And
tho' the <HI>Persian</HI> Kingdom continu'd for &s;eve|ral
Ages, and with the Character of the great|e&s;t
<PB N="228" REF="260">
Empire of the known World, her Great|ne&s;s
con&s;i&s;ted rather in Riches, and Extent of
Territory, than any memorable Atchievements&punc;
And the Continuance of it was owing to no|thing
more, than tho&s;e inte&s;tine Broils among
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> which we &s;hall find, by the Pro|&s;ecution
of their Story, diverted them from
pu&s;hing their Conque&s;ts in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|duct of <HI>Themi&s;to|cles</HI> in re|building the Walls of <HI>Athens.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Athenians</HI> with their Families be|ing
return'd, employ'd their Share of the
Booty in rebuilding their City. But as their
Walls took in a much la$ger Compa&s;s than be|fore,
this gave &s;ome Umbrage to the <HI>Lacedae|monians,</HI>
who truly enough concluded, <HI>That
if this City, when it lay in Ruins, could do &s;uch
Wonders, what would it not a&s;pire to, when it
was &s;o fortify'd?</HI> Wherefore they di&s;patch'd
Amba&s;&s;adors to di&s;&s;uade them from carrying
on there Works, becau&s;e they would only
&s;erve as Garri&s;ons for the Enemy, and be the
Seat of a future War. This put a Stop to
their Proceedings for the pre&s;ents,'till <HI>Themi|&s;tocles</HI>
encourag'd them to go on, whil&s;t he un|dertook
to an&s;wer it at <HI>Sparta.</HI> Where having
gain'd what time he could, before he had Au|dience,
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> began to &s;u&s;pect his
De&s;ign, and renew'd their Remon&s;trances. He
advis'd them not to take up with every idl$
Report, but to &s;end again, and &s;ee how little
the Works were advanc'd. Thus having
a|mus'd them, 'till the Walls were fini&s;h'd, he ad|dre&s;s'd
himself to the <HI>Ephori,</HI> $elling 'em plainly.
<HI>That</HI> Athens <HI>was now in a Condition to keep
out any Enemy, whether Foreign, or Dome&s;tick&punc;
that in what the</HI> Athenians <HI>had done, both the
<PB N="229" REF="261">
Law of Nations, and the publick Intere&s;t of
<HI>Greece</HI> would &s;ufficiently bear them out; in &s;hort
that they were be&s;t $word$ to judge of their own
Affairs, without $word$ Direction, or Controul of
any other State; <HI>adding farther,</HI> That it was
done by his $word$; and that whatever injury
they offer'd to him, they mu&s;t expect it would be
return'd upon their own Amba&s;&s;adors who were
detain'd at</HI> Athens. The&s;e Declarations car|ry'd
too much Weight, and Truth with 'em,
to be ea&s;ily refuted: So that the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
finding they could not help them&s;el$es, &s;tifled
their Re&s;entment, and di&s;mi&s;s'd <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI>
He was receiv'd at <HI>Athens</HI> with as much Joy,
as if he had actually triumph'd over <HI>Sparta:</HI>
And indeed this was the fir&s;t con&s;iderable Step
towards throwing off that Superiority, which
&s;he had hitherto exacted. After this he &s;et
him&s;elf to enlarging, and &s;trengthning the
Port <HI>Piraeus,</HI> omitting nothing either by Sea, or
Land, that might &s;erve not only to &s;ecure the
<HI>Athenians</HI> from abroad, but al&s;o to fix their
Dominion at home. As an Expedient for
this latter, he propos'd burning the <HI>Lacedaemo|nian</HI>
Fleet, as it lay in Harbour; but this was
&s;uch a manife&s;t piece of Inju&s;tice, that he
could not make <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> having &s;till &s;ome footing in
<HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M</NOTE> and the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3527.</NOTE> thirty <HI>Athenian</HI>

They &s;et Sail to <HI>Cyprus;</HI> where they freed
&s;everal Towns, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> had ga$ri&s;on|ed;
from whence they re-imbark'd, and took <HI>By|zantium.

upon the Succe&s;s of this Expedition, and

to the Confederates, that they were glad

to the Sovereignty of <HI>Greece,</HI> and that
in order to it, he held Intelligence with the
Enemy: But the Evidence not being full e|nough
again&s;t him, he was acquitted, with the
Lo&s;s only of his Command.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Com|mand at Sea tran&s;|ferr'd to the</HI> Athen|nians.</NOTE> However this

and all the other Cities without the
<HI>I&s;thmus</HI> were &s;o taken with the Candor and
Sweetne&s;s of his Temper, that they &s;oon fol|low'd
their Example: So that when another
was &s;ent from <HI>Sparta</HI> in <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI>'s room, the
Confederates would not admit him. The <HI>La|cedaemonians</HI>
could not but fancy them&s;elves o|ver-reach'd,
and trick'd out of their Command
at Sea; and tho' they made no publick Noi&s;e
about it, yet it came to be debated among
them&s;elves, whether they &s;hould declare War
again&s;t <HI>Athens.</HI> This reviv'd an old Prophecy
of the Oracl$, which had bid them <HI>Beware of
having but half an Empire,</HI> and which they
could not interpret otherwi&s;e, than in Relation
to their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. So that the
general Opinion was for War; but <HI>Hetaemari|das</HI>
a Senator di&s;&s;uaded it, urging among other
Rea&s;$ns, <HI>That it did not &s;o properly belong to the</HI>
Spartans, <HI>to trouble themselves about Sea-Affairs.</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="263">
The truth is, they were not in a Condition at
pre&s;ent to conte&s;t it; and therefore they wav'd
the Thoughts of this War, to join in the Pro|&s;ecution
of that in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of the War being thus devolv'd
upon the <HI>Athenians,</HI> they had a Liberty given
them to rate all the Cities in &s;uch a Proportion
of Ships, and Mony, as they thought nece&s;&s;ary
for the Support of it. Whatever Contributions
had hitherto been paid in the Confederate Wars,
this was the fir&s;t regular Tax we find mention'd
in <HI>Greece.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Tax in</HI> Greece.</NOTE> It being appointed by <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI>

and was depo&s;ited at <HI>Delos</HI> as the publick Trea|&s;ury.
It was collected at fir&s;t with &s;o much
Ea&s;e, and Chearfulne&s;s, and managed with &s;uch
Integrity, that upon this Account it was call'd,
<HI>The happy Time of</HI> Greece, and compar'd to the

which the <HI>Athenians</HI> were inve&s;ted chiefly up|on
the Opinion of <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI>'s Ju&s;tice, was a
Confirmation of that Power, they had &s;o late|ly
wre&s;ted from the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI> But as it
was the Beginning of their Greatne&s;s in this
Age, &s;o it was of their Ruin in the next, when
the Tribute came to be rais'd fir&s;t to &s;ix hun|dred
Talents, and &s;oon after to one thou&s;and
three hundred, and the Mony mi&s;apply'd.</P>
<P>The General Commander in this War,
was <HI>Cimon</HI> the Son of <HI>Miltiades.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ri&s;e of</HI> Cimon.</NOTE> I mention'd
the Piety of this young Man in taking his Fa|ther's

it happen'd, that <HI>Callias</HI> a rich Citizen offer'd to
marry his half-Si&s;ter <HI>Elpinice,</HI> and di&s;charge it.
Whether he did not think it a Match &s;uitable
to her Quality, or that he was marry'd to her
<PB N="232" REF="264">
him&s;elf, (which was allowable by <HI>Solon</HI>'s Laws)
he did not comply with the Propo&s;al; but &s;he
declaring, <HI>She would not &s;uffer any of</HI> Miltia|des's
<HI>Children to die in Pri&s;on,</HI> accepted it. Be|ing
thus &s;ee at Liberty, he did good Service in
the Army; and was &s;oon taken Notice of, as
one who acted with the Courage of his Father,
and the Judgment of <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> and with
more Openne&s;s, and Sincerity than either.
<HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> who ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd this hone&s;t
<HI>Genius</HI> in him, took care to cultivate it, and &s;et
him up as a Counter-poi&s;e to the Craft, and
Ambition of <HI>Themi&s;tocles:</HI> By which means he
was advanc'd to the highe&s;t Employments both
at home and abroad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Expe|dition to</HI> Thrace, <HI>and the I&s;lands.</HI></NOTE> And being now &s;trengthen'd
by an Acce&s;&s;ion of the Allies, he went into

upon the River <HI>Strymon,</HI> and cha&s;tis'd the bor|dering
<HI>Thracians,</HI> who had &s;upply'd it with Pro|vi&s;ions.
But the Behaviour of <HI>Butes</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>
Governor of this Town, is beyond any thing
that is recorded of his Countrymen during this
War. For finding it impo&s;&s;ible to hold out any
longer, he threw all his Trea&s;ure into the Ri|ver,
and then erected a Funeral Pile, whereon
he burnt him&s;elf, and his whole Family. From
thence <HI>Cimon</HI> made to the I&s;land <HI>Scyrus,</HI> inhabi|ted
by &s;ome of the <HI>Pela&s;gi,</HI> and <HI>Dolopes</HI> a Ne&s;t
of Pirates; and by expelling them, open'd the
Trad$ of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea: And all the&s;e Places
were planted with <HI>Athenian</HI> Colonies. His next
Attemp$ was upon the <HI>Cary&s;tians of Euboea,</HI> whom
he brought over upon Terms; he afterwards
reduc'd <HI>Naxos,</HI> which had revolted, and de|priv'd $word$
$nhabitants of their Liberty. Which
was the fir&s;t In&s;tance of the <HI>Athenians</HI> exerting
<PB N="233" REF="265">
their Power in that Kind&punc; beyond the Laws of
the Confederacy; tho' it was afterwards fre|quently
practis'd, as the other Cities revolted,
to which they were very inclinable upon ac|count
of the Tribute, which the <HI>Athenians</HI> be|gan
to exact with &s;o much Rigour, as made the
Thing burden&s;ome, and their Government o|dious.
To remedy which, <HI>Cimon</HI> took a very
plau&s;ible Method, and no le&s;s advantageous to
<HI>Athens,</HI> than ea&s;ie to her Allies. For perceiving
mo&s;t of them grown weary of the War, e&s;peci|ally
&s;ince the Seat of it was &s;o far remov'd, that
they were under no pre&s;ent Apprehen&s;ions of
Danger, and that they were willing enough to
continue the Tax, provided their actual Atten|dance
might be di&s;penc'd with, he accepted
their &s;everal Proportions in Mony, and Ships
unmann'd. So that while they were enjoying
this Interval of Repo&s;e, <HI>Athens</HI> was the only
State kept under con&s;tant Di&s;cipline, and well
provided; and then they were &s;oon forc'd to
Court, and flatter tho&s;e, whom they had con|tributed
to make no le&s;s formidable in <HI>Greece,</HI>
than <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> 'till they fell to that Degree of
Subjection, as of Allies they almo&s;t became Tri|butaries,
and Slaves.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> during the&s;e Tran&s;actions kept
towards the-Sea, to concert Mea&s;ures with the
<HI>Per&s;ian;</HI> but his De&s;igns were &s;till travers'd by
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Generals; upon which he under|went
a &s;econd Trial: And whether his Pra|cti&s;es
were not yet fully detected, or that they
were tender in the Pro&s;ecution of one of
the Royal Blood, and who had once de&s;erv'd &s;o
well, he was again di&s;charg'd. But per&s;i&s;ting in
<PB N="234" REF="266">
his fir&s;t Intentions, and finding his Affairs ad|vance
&s;lowly abroad, he thought to make
quicker Di&s;patch of it at home; and in Order
to it about this time excited the <HI>Helots</HI> to rebel.
The Di&s;covery of this &s;erv'd to confirm all the
re&s;t; and Letters were produc'd, by which it
appear'd, that he not only corre&s;ponded with
<HI>Xerxes,</HI> but that he had actually contracted to
betray <HI>Greece</HI> to him, and as a Reward was to
receive his Daughter in Marriage.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The End of</HI> Pau&s;anias.</NOTE> Being thus

Papers &s;ome Hints of a Corre&s;pondence carry'd
on between the&s;e two for promoting the Affairs
of the <HI>Per&s;ian:</HI> And if he were engaged in that
Intere&s;t, his Country's Ingratitude might very
well prompt him to it. But whatever the
Matter of Fact was, it was &s;ufficiently aggrava|ted
by the Envy and Malice of the <HI>Lacedaemo|nians,</HI>
who having receiv'd from him the &s;eve|re&s;t
Checks to their Ambition, never left off,
'till they got him accus'd and condemn'd, with|out
being heard. Which he having Notice of,
fled fir&s;t to <HI>Corcyra,</HI> then to <HI>Epirus:</HI> where be|ing
pur&s;u'd, he got with much difficulty into
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and apply'd him&s;elf to <HI>Xerxes. Thucydi|des</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="267">
&s;ays, contrary to the general Opinion, that
his Son <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> was then upon the Throne:

Kings to name their Succe&s;&s;or &s;ome time before
they dy'd, as we find <HI>Darius</HI> did before his Ex|pedition;
at lea&s;t this is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible
Way of reconciling the Difference. <HI>Xerxes</HI> re|ceiv'd
him with uncommon Marks of Friend|ship,
and E&s;teem, hoping by his means to
make another more &s;ucce&s;sful Attempt upon
<HI>Greece.</HI> He gave him three Cities to maintain
him; &s;o that having liv'd &s;ome time in great
Splendor, he dy'd, as &s;ome &s;ay, a natural

the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> not to undertake the War a|gain&s;t
<HI>Greece</HI> without him, he poi&s;on'd him&s;elf,
as being the mo&s;t honourable Means of acquit|ting
him&s;elf both to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> and his Country.
Whatever his Intentions were, his Actions were
free from Guilt to the la&s;t: So that his re&s;i|ding
in an Enemies Country, &s;eems to have

who could not at the &s;ame time but acknow|ledge
him for the greate&s;t Man in <HI>Greece,</HI> and
one born for its Pre&s;ervation. 'Tis certain,
that he fir&s;t gave the <HI>Athenians</HI> a right Notion
of Sea Affairs; and not only laid the Founda|tion
of their Naval Glory, but brought it to
a Degree of Perfection, e&s;tabli&s;hing it as a
Maxim, <HI>That their pre&s;ent, and future Safety de|pended
intirely upon their Shipping,</HI> Tho' they
were not pre&s;ently convinc'd of this Truth;
<PB N="236" REF="268">
and therefore reproach'd him with <HI>Taking them
from the Spear, and the Shield, and binding them
to the Bank, and the Oar.</HI> He was no le&s;s to

no body fore&s;aw Things at a greater Di&s;tance,
or pa&s;s'd a quicker, and truer Judgment of
them in Ca&s;es of pre&s;ent Difficulty. The&s;e
natural Advantages he &s;et off with a great deal
of Artifice. For In&s;tance, when he had a
mind to be popular, he made u&s;e of his Memo|ry,
to call every Citizen by his Name. When
he was Admiral, he would put off all Bu&s;ine&s;s

enough to intitle him to the fir&s;t Place in the

which others a&s;pir'd to by a more popu|lar
Sort of Merit, being content to act, as it
were, under <HI>The$i&s;tocles.</HI> But we mu&s;t not
omit one con&s;iderable Change he effected of
him&s;elf whil&s;t he was <HI>Archon,</HI> in repealing a
<HI>Law of Solon</HI>'s, by which the lowe&s;t Order of
<PB N="237" REF="269">
the People were made incapable of bearing any
Office in the Government. He naturally fa|vour'd
the Nobility; but when he found the
People carry it high upon their Service again&s;t
the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> he thought it of le&s;s dangerous Con|&s;equence,
that they mould be let into the Admi|ni&s;tration
by Law, than that they &s;hould let
them&s;elves in by Force. He &s;tudy'd to make
the State as quiet at home, as it was terrible
abroad: And as an In&s;tance of the con&s;tant, un|bia&s;s'd
Zeal he expre&s;s'd for his Country, he
would often put up his Propo&s;als in other Peo|ples
Names, that nothing of private Enmity
might interpo&s;e to the Prejudice of the Publick.
Thus he had at lea&s;t the &s;econd Hand in rai&s;ing
<HI>Athens</HI> to her pre&s;ent pitch of Grandeur; and as
<HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> was the greate&s;t, &s;o was <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI>
the be&s;t Man of his time.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Athens</HI> being depriv'd of the&s;e Supports,
the chief Burden lay upon <HI>Cimon;</HI> who having
been &s;ucce&s;sful hitherto, and being furni&s;h'd with
more Ships, and Provi&s;ions, &s;cour'd the <HI>A&s;-tatick</HI>
Seas, and made to <HI>Caria;</HI> where all the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Cities upon the Sea-Coa&s;t immediately came
in; and the re&s;t, which were garri&s;on'd by the
<HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> he took partly by Storm, and partly
by managing Intelligence within their Walls.
After which he met with the like Succe&s;s in
<HI>Lycia.</HI> So clo&s;ely did he pur&s;ue them, that
he would not let them take breath, or put their
Affairs in any Po&s;ture: So that from <HI>Ionia</HI> to
<HI>Pamphylia</HI> there was not a Man appea$'d for the
<HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> Having Notice that they had &s;ome
Land Forces making head again&s;t him upon the
Coa&s;ts of <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> and that they were &s;up|ported
<PB N="238" REF="270">
by a Fleet of at lea&s;t three hundred and
fifty Sail, he immediately directed his Cour&s;$
towards <HI>Cyprus,</HI> about which the Fleet lay
The fir&s;t Oppo&s;ition he met with, was at <HI>Pha$|&s;elis</HI>
inhabited by <HI>Grecians,</HI> who upon a Pretenc$
of Neutrality, deny'd him Entrance into thei$
Port: But he &s;oon oblig'd them to pay dow$
ten Talents as a Fine, and to join their Force$
with him.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Fleet anchor'd at th$
Mouth of the River <HI>Eurymedon,</HI> where they
expected a Reinforcement of <HI>Phaenician</HI> Sai$
and therefore declin'd fighting, 'till they could
come up: But <HI>Cimon</HI> rang'd his Gallies in &s;uch
a Po&s;ture, as to prevent their joining, and ye$
force them to fight. Upon which they re$tir'd
further within the Mouth of the River$
'till finding the <HI>Athenians</HI> making up to them
they met them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fight at</HI> Eury|medon. A. M.</NOTE> and gave them Battel. Ha|ving
the Superiority of an hundred Sail, they
maintain'd the Conflict for &s;ome time, but a$
la&s;t they were forc'd to Shore;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> where they tha$
came fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3534.</NOTE> threw them&s;elves upon Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 77. 3</NOTE> leaving
their empty Ve&s;&s;els to the Enemy. So that be$
&s;ides what were &s;unk, the <HI>Athenians</HI> took a$
hundred, snd &s;ome Accounts double that Num|ber.
Upon this their Land Army drawing to$
wards the Sea, <HI>Cimon</HI> was in Su&s;pence, whether$
he &s;hould make a De&s;cent: But finding hi$
Men re&s;olute, and flu&s;h'd with Victory, he lan$ded
them before they had wiped off the Swea$$
and Blood of the fir&s;t Engagement. <HI>Diodor$$</HI>
&s;ays, they were landed by a Stratagem of <HI>C$$mon</HI>'s,
who dre&s;s'd the be&s;t of his Men in <HI>Plr|&s;ian</HI>
Habits, and put 'em on board the Ve&s;&s;e$
he had taken. However it was, they no &s;oone
<PB N="239" REF="271">
touch'd Ground, but they &s;et up a Shout, and
ran furiou&s;ly upon the Enemy, who &s;u&s;tain'd
the fir&s;t Shock with great Ob&s;tinacy; &s;o that
the Fight began to be very doubtful, &s;everal
principal Men of the <HI>Athenians</HI> being &s;lain. At
length the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were totally routed, &s;ome
taken Pri&s;oners, and all their Tents plunder'd;
wherein was a great deal of rich Booty, mo&s;t
of which was employ'd by <HI>Cimon</HI> in publick
Buildings about the City. Thus did <HI>Cimon</HI>
obtain two intire Victories, which in &s;ome &s;en&s;e
may be &s;aid to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of <HI>Salamis,</HI> and
<HI>Plataea,</HI> being both gain'd the &s;ame Day, and
by the &s;ame Men. And to make them yet more
compleat, he intercepted eighty Sail of <HI>Phaeni|cians,</HI>
who knowing nothing of the Defeat, were
coming up to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Allies: The
Ships were all taken, and the Men either &s;lain,
or drown'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> after this was glad to treat upon
any Terms;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Peace concluded betwixt</HI> Greece, <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ia.</NOTE> and a Peace was concluded ex|tremely
honourable on the <HI>Grecians</HI> Side, the
chief Articles being, <HI>That the</HI> Grecian <HI>Cities in</HI> A&s;ia <HI>&s;hould be left in the quiet Enjoyment of their
Liberty; and that both the Land and Sea Forces
of the</HI> Per&s;ians <HI>&s;hould be kept at &s;uch a Di&s;tance
from the</HI> Grecian <HI>Seas, as not to give any &V;m|brage.</HI>
'Tis true, the Account of this Peace
depends chiefly upon the Authority of <HI>Plutarch;</HI>
for others place it lower, upon <HI>Cimon</HI>'s Expe|dition
again&s;t <HI>Cyprus.</HI> To confirm which latter
Opinion, it is certain the &s;ame Inveteracy con|tinu'd
between the two Nations, and therefore
this fir&s;t Treaty was not inviolably ob&s;erv'd:
But as the War was pro&s;ecuted only by the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> and that very faintly, and not &s;o
<PB N="240" REF="272">
directly again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> it never after this

nor indeed to $word$ general Actio$, 'till the time
that <HI>Alexander</HI> over-run <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> For which Rea|&s;ons
we may allow of this Treaty, and with it
conclude the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> War.</P>
<P>About the time of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s Expedition, the

His chief Talent was <HI>Elegy;</HI> wherein he &s;uc|ceeded

having defeated them at Sea, they &s;tood

<HI>Spartans</HI> to invade <HI>Attica.</HI> But they had at
that time their Hands full in repairing the Da|mages

a great many Men, with mo&s;t part of
their Buildings: And <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> by tampering

rebel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And The|&s;0s.</NOTE> So that the <HI>Tha&s;ans</HI> not being able

in the third Year of the Siege. But Ciman in|&s;tead
of being rewarded for this Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon ac|cus'd.</NOTE> was
accus'd of holding Intelligence with the King
of <HI>Macedon,</HI> becau&s;e when the Pa&s;&s;age was
open'd, he did not make a further Irruption
into his Territories. He urg'd &s;everal things
in his Defence, and was &s;econded by his Si&s;ter
<HI>Elpinice;</HI> who addre&s;&s;ing her &s;elf to <HI>Pericles</HI> in

mild in his Pro&s;ecution; he ro&s;e up but once
to plead again&s;t him, and then did it &s;o faintly,
that he was ea&s;ily acquitted.</P>
<P>But &s;ince we have mentioned <HI>Pericles,</HI> as
one who appear'd now with an e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Character, and began to take upon him the chief
Management of Affairs in <HI>Athens,</HI> it may be
nece&s;&s;ary to take a more di&s;tinct View of him,
that we may &s;ee both by what Steps he ar|riv'd
to that Eminence in the State, and what
Alterations the State it &s;elf &s;uffer'd under him,
He was de&s;cended of one of the be&s;t Families
in <HI>Athens,</HI> his Father being <HI>Xanthippus,</HI> who
had been very active again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> and
bore a con&s;iderable Sway in the City, and his
Mother <HI>Agari&s;te,</HI> the Grand-daughter of <HI>Cli&s;fthenes.</HI>
His Education was &s;uitable to his Birth;
and having a &s;trange Vivacity of Parts, he ea|&s;ily
retain'd, and improv'd the In&s;tructions of
the be&s;t Ma&s;ters: Among whom <HI>Anaxagoras</HI>
was the chief; for as others had only furni&s;h'd
him with &s;ome loo&s;e Notions of Philo&s;ophy,
he e&s;tabli&s;h'd in him Maxims of &s;ound Sen&s;e,
and put him upon an Enquiry into the &s;ecret
Springs, and Arts of Government. It was ob|&s;erv'd,
that he bore a near Re&s;emblance to <HI>Pi|&s;i&s;tratus</HI>
both in Per&s;on, and Parts: But he was
&s;o far from thinking this an Advantage, that
it made him &s;hy of meddling with State-A&s;|fairs,
lea&s;t it &s;ould be thought he was carry|ing
on the &s;ame De&s;igns. For this Rea&s;on his
fir&s;t Service was in the Wars, where he ac|quitted
him&s;elf with Honour: But he tool

<FIGURE>

his Opportunity, as <HI>Themi&s;tocles, Ari&s;tide,</HI> and
the other great Men went off, to apply him|&s;elf
to the State, as his more proper Province;
where he appear'd with an extraordinary Ad|vantage
in the <HI>Art of Speaking.</HI> He had ac|cu&s;tom'd
him&s;el&s; by a Flow of Words to con&s;ute
any Opinion right or wrong; and the U&s;e
he made of this Faculty, was to work every
thing to his own De&s;igns. His way of haranguing
was in an <HI>Imperial Strain;</HI> from
whence mo&s;t probably he had the Sirname of
<HI>Olympius,</HI> intimating, that like <HI>Jupiter, he thun|derd
when he &s;poke.</HI> And then the Tunable|ne&s;s
of his Voice, the Air of his Face, his ve|ry
Dre&s;s, and Ge&s;ture had &s;omething of a com|manding
Gravity, which charm'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd
all that heard, or &s;aw him. The chief Ob&s;tacle
to his Ri&s;e he found was <HI>Cimon,</HI> who&s;e
Candor, Liberality, and good Service had pro|cur'd
him a general Love, and E&s;teem, and who
be&s;ides had fix'd a particular Intere&s;t with the
Nobility: So that <HI>Pericles</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to
him fell in with the People; and as he &s;aw no
other way of pu&s;hing his Ambition, this made
him guilty of &s;ome mean popular Compliances,
which otherwi&s;e the Greatne&s;s of his Spirit,
and the Re&s;ervedne&s;s of his Temper would not
have con&s;ented to. As he was not yet upon
an equal Foot with <HI>Cimon,</HI> who had Mony e|nough
to di&s;play his generous Qualities to Ad|vantage,
and by that means to thwart his De|&s;igns,
this put him upon making u&s;e of the
publick Mony: So that by Bribes, Large&s;&s;es,
and other Di&s;tributions, he ea&s;ily gain'd the
People. Having laid this promi&s;ing Foundation,
he &s;truck next at the Council of <HI>Areopa|gus;</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="277">
and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Ephialtes</HI> another
mighty Champion for the People, he with|drew
mo&s;t Cau&s;es from the Cognizance of that
Court, and brought the whole Order into Con|tempt.
By the&s;e Methods he &s;oon got the
A&s;cendant over all his Competitors; and if <HI>Ci|mon</HI>
was not per&s;ecuted with any great Heat,
and Rancour, it was becau&s;e he was wanted,
and through the Ea&s;ine&s;s of his Temper he
comply'd, and gave way, contenting him&s;elf ra|ther
with the Merit, than the Reward of &s;er|ving his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> in their Di&s;tre&s;s &s;ent for
&s;ome <HI>Athenian</HI> Succours to &s;uppre&s;s their
Slaves: But <HI>Ephialtes</HI> oppos'd it, as a very
wrong Step to rai&s;e up, or a&s;&s;i&s;t a City that
was Rival to <HI>Athens;</HI> he in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>That it was
nece&s;&s;ary to break the Pride, and Arrogance of</HI>
Sparta; <HI>and that the be&s;t means of doing it, was
while She was down, to keep her &s;o. Cimon</HI> ur|ging
on the contrary, <HI>That they &s;hould not &s;uffer</HI>

of her Companion,</HI> obtain'd leave to march
out with a good Body to their Relief. But
however the <HI>Helots</HI> were di&s;pers'd for the pre|&s;ent,
they &s;oon got to an head again; and ha|ving
drawn &s;everal of their Neighbours into
a Con&s;ederacy, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of <HI>Ithome,</HI>
the old Receptacle in the <HI>Me&s;&s;enian</HI> Wars.
Upon which the <HI>Spartans</HI> di&s;patch'd Me&s;&s;ngers
a &s;econd time to <HI>Athens</HI> for Supplies: Which
were no &s;ooner arriv'd, but their Minds chang'd;
&s;o that either di&s;tru&s;ting, or di&s;daining their
Service, they &s;ent them home again. What|ever
Cau&s;e of Re&s;entment the <HI>Spartans</HI> had hi|therto
<PB N="245" REF="278">
met with, they had &s;till carry'd it fair,
or at lea&s;t cautiou&s;ly: But this was &s;uch an
open Affront, that it became the Grounds of
a long profe&s;s'd Enmity between the two
States. The <HI>Athenians</HI> vented their Anger fir&s;t
upon <HI>Cimon,</HI> as a Favourer of the <HI>Lacedaemoni|ans.</HI>
He was indeed an Admirer of their Con|&s;titution,
and had Per&s;onal Obligations to them,
being at his fir&s;t Ri&s;e chiefly countenanc'd by
them in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Themi&s;tocles.</HI> Be&s;ides he
had created him&s;elf Enemies by e&s;pou&s;ing the
Intere&s;t of the Nobility again&s;t <HI>Pericles,</HI> and
<HI>Ephialtes.</HI> So that upon the&s;e, and other &s;light
Pretences,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ri&s;e of</HI> Pericles.</NOTE> he was forc'd to &s;ubmit to the <HI>ten
Years Bani&s;oment.</HI> But whatever was alledg'd
again&s;t him, his Ca&s;e was much the &s;ame with
that of his Predece&s;&s;ors: He had done too
much to live ea&s;ie, or &s;afe with a People, who
fear'd none &s;o much, as the Authors of their
Deliverance; &s;o that they had recour&s;e to the
<HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> as an Expedient always at hand; and
it was now grown &s;o Cu&s;tomary, that it was
in a manner become the <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of a Man's
Merit.</P>
<P>The next Step the <HI>Athenians</HI> made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon ba|ni&s;'d.</NOTE> was to
quit their Alliance with the <HI>Spartans,</HI> and enter
into one with the <HI>Argives</HI> their pro&s;e&s;s'd Enemies,
in which they al&s;o comprehended the
<HI>The&s;&s;alians.</HI> The jarring of the&s;e two States
gave occa&s;ion to &s;everal others to follow their
Example. Particularly about this time the In|habitants
of <HI>Mycenae</HI> carrying it high upon their
Service in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars, endeavour'd to recover
their ancient Splendor, by throwing off
their Dependance upon the Common-wealth
of <HI>Argos.</HI> The <HI>Argives</HI> had long look'd upon
<PB N="246" REF="279">
them with a jealous Eye; and took this Oppor|tunity
of humbling them, whil&s;t the <HI>Spartans</HI>
were too deeply engag'd in their Dome&s;tick
War, to relieve them. Accordingly they fir&s;t
defeated them in the Field, and then block'd
up their City; which made a very good Defence
for &s;ome time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mycenae <HI>taken and demoli&s;h'd.</HI></NOTE> 'till being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted,
it was taken, and utterly demoli&s;h'd. This
was the End of <HI>Mycenoe</HI> which had made an
early Figure in <HI>Greece,</HI> and been the Nur&s;ery of
many of her fir&s;t Heroes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Helots <HI>&s;uppre&s;s'd.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Helots</HI> all this
while gave the <HI>Spartans</HI> a great deal of Trouble
before <HI>Ithome:</HI> But in the tenth Year of the
Siege they were forc'd to &s;ubmit; and being
bani&s;h'd <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> receiv'd
them, and &s;ettled them with their Families in
<HI>Naupactus,</HI> which they had lately taken from
the <HI>Locri Ozolae.</HI> There was al&s;o about this
time a Quarrel between <HI>Corinth,</HI> and <HI>Megara;</HI>
the latter of which Cities revolting from its
Alliance with <HI>Sparta,</HI> was protected, and garri&s;on'd
by the <HI>Athenians:</HI> Which as it was a
new Acce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Athens,</HI> &s;o it was the Grounds
of an inveterate Hatred betwixt that State, and
<HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>II. But before we proceed to the Effects of
the&s;e Divisions, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to touch
upon a new Expedition of the <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs in Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> in
<HI>aegypt,</HI> which had revolted from the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI>
at the In&s;tigation of <HI>Inarus</HI> King of <HI>Lybia.</HI>
The <HI>Athenians,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the late Trea|ty,
had rigg'd out a good Fleet, the De&s;ign being
laid again&s;t <HI>Cyprus;</HI> which lying in the
Streights between <HI>Cilicia, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
would give them a great Command in tho&s;e
<PB N="247" REF="280">
Parts, and be upon all Occa&s;ions a Curb to the
<HI>Per&s;ian. Inarus</HI> knowing of what U&s;e they
would be to him, diverted them from this Enterpri&s;e,
by propo&s;ing to them a Share in his
Conque&s;ts, as of far greater Con&s;equence to
them, than the Addition of a &s;mall I&s;land.
Accordingly they went with two hundred Sail
to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and were no &s;ooner landed,
but they join'd Battel, routed the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and
pur&s;u'd them to <HI>Memphis,</HI> took two Parts of
the City, and block'd up the third, which
went by the Name of the <HI>White Wall. Artax|erxes,</HI>
tho' he &s;ent above three hundred thou|&s;and
Men into the Field, was &s;o hard pre&s;s'd, that
he practis'd with the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to invade
<HI>Attica,</HI> in hopes the <HI>Athenians</HI> would be re|call'd
to its Defence. This was the fir&s;t In|&s;tance of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> attempting to bribe one
Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> to act again&s;t the other: How|ever
their Genero&s;ity, or their Fear &s;way'd &s;o
much with them, as to reject his Propo&s;als.
But the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> coming next Year with a great
Reinforcement of Men, and Shipping, gave a
mighty Turn to their Affairs. The <HI>Athenians</HI>
had made &s;everal Attempts to &s;torm the
<HI>White Wall:</HI> But upon the Approach of the&s;e
Forces they were oblig'd to rai&s;e the Siege,
and retire into <HI>Byblus</HI> a Town of <HI>Pro&s;opis</HI> an
I&s;land of the <HI>Nile,</HI> with their Fleet lying in
the River before the Town. Here they held
out a Siege of eighteen Months: After which
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> turning the Cour&s;e of the River,
drain'd the Channel; and having by that means
taken their Gallies, put all the Men to the
Sword, except &s;ome few, who e&s;cap'd into <HI>Ly|bia:</HI>
Tho' <HI>Diodorus &s;ays,</HI> that finding their
<PB N="248" REF="281">
Ships made u&s;ele&s;s by this Stratagem, they &s;et
fire to 'em them&s;elves, re&s;olving to fight it out
to the la&s;t Man; and that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;eeing
their Ob&s;tinacy, let them go upon Terms,
'Tis certain, that being abandon'd by the <HI>Ae|gyptians,</HI>
they were &s;o weaken'd, that they
could not make head again. And to compleat
their Misfortunes, it happen'd that fifty Sail
being &s;ent to their Relief, and knowing no|thing
of their Defeat, fell in with the <HI>Phoeni|cians</HI>
at <HI>Mende&s;ium</HI> one of the Mouths of <HI>Nile,</HI>
and were mo&s;t of them de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>Six Years the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;pent in this fruit|le&s;s
Expedition; during which time their Fel|low-Citizens
found Employment enough among
their Neighbours. Their Quarrel with
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> about <HI>Megara</HI> came to two
pitch'd Battels; wherein the <HI>Epidaurians</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
<HI>Corinth,</HI> and both Sides were Victorious in
their Turns. Soon after the War was renew'd
with the <HI>aeginetans,</HI> who&s;e Reputation for Sea-Affairs
having been confirmed by their Service
again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> they could ill bear the exce&s;|&s;ive Growth of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Power. But they
were &s;hamefully defeated with the Lo&s;s of &s;eventy
Sail: After which <HI>Leocrates</HI> landed in
the I&s;land, and block'd up the City. The <HI>Pe|loponne&s;ians</HI>
&s;ent three hundred Men to its Relief:
And the <HI>Corinthians</HI> took this Opportunity,
Whil&s;t the <HI>Athenian</HI> Forces were dividee
betwixt <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>aeina,</HI> to make Incur|&s;ions
into <HI>Megaris.</HI> But the <HI>Athenians</HI> march'd
out of the City to a Man again&s;t them unde
the Conduct of <HI>Myronides.</HI> In the fir&s;t Batte
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> without rea&s;on pretended to
have the better: But upon their coming
<PB N="249" REF="282">
erect a Trophy, a &s;econd en&s;u'd, wherein they
were intirely defeated.</P>
<P>The next Quarrel of importance was between
the <HI>Phocians</HI> and <HI>Dorians;</HI> to the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of which latter the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> as
being originally de&s;cended from them, &s;ent an
Army of eleven thou&s;and five hundred Men.
The&s;e Forces &s;oon brought the <HI>Phocians</HI> to
Terms; but gave Occa&s;ion to a much &s;harper
Conte&s;t with the <HI>Athenians:</HI> Who perceiving
that they loiter'd about <HI>Boeotia</HI> for fear of be|ing
intercepted in their Return, drain'd their
City again, and with their own, and their Con|federate
Forces making up fourteen thou&s;and
Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel at</HI> Tanagra.</NOTE> met them about <HI>Tanagra</HI> a City not far
di&s;tant from <HI>Thebes.</HI> Here <HI>Cimon</HI> came in to
them; and tho' he was &s;till under the Sentence of <HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> rang'd him&s;elf with tho&s;e of his
own Tribe. But the <HI>Council of five hundred</HI>
not knowing what De&s;igns he might have,
commanded the Officers not to receive him:
Whereupon he left the Army, conjuring <HI>Eu|thippus,</HI>
and the re&s;t of his Companions, who
lay under the &s;ame Su&s;picion of favouring the
Enemy, to behave them&s;elves &s;o, as to vindi|cate
their good Intentions to their Country.
They follow'd his Advice; and being an hun|dred
in Number made a &s;eparate Body; and,
the Battel being join'd, charg'd &s;o de&s;perately,
that they were all cut off, leaving to the <HI>A|thenians</HI>
a double Regret, both for the Lo&s;s of
&s;uch brave Men, and for their having &s;o unju&s;t|ly
&s;u&s;pected them. After a great Slaughter on
both Sides, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> obtain'd the
Victory; which was occa&s;ion'd chiefly by the
Revolt of the <HI>The&s;&s;alian</HI> Hor&s;e to them in the
<PB N="250" REF="283">
heat of the Action. After which they hara&s;s'd
<HI>Megaris,</HI> and return'd home through the <HI>I&s;th|mus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> in about two Months after
this Defeat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another at</HI> Oenophy|ta.</NOTE> re&s;olving to revenge them&s;elves,
march'd again into <HI>Boeotia,</HI> and intirely routed
the Inhabitants, with tho&s;e <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> For|ces,
which were left about <HI>Tanagra.</HI> This Bat|tel
was fought at a Place call'd <HI>Oenophyta.</HI> or
the <HI>Vineyards:</HI> And tho' the Manner and Or|der
of it is no where de&s;crib'd, <HI>Diodorus</HI> makes
it as famous as any of Antiquity, in regard it
was fought again&s;t as &s;tout and hardy of Peo|ple
as any in <HI>Greece,</HI> and the Succe&s;s of it was
owing purely to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Valour, without
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Confederates. After the
Fight they took <HI>Tanagra</HI> by Storm, and demo|li&s;h'd
it; over-run the greate&s;t part of <HI>Boeotia,</HI>
as al&s;o of <HI>Phocis,</HI> and the <HI>Locri Opuntii;</HI> of
which latter they took an hundred Ho&s;tages,
and return'd to <HI>Athens;</HI> where <HI>Myronides</HI> their
General was receiv'd with great Acclamations,
for having accompli&s;h'd &s;o much in &s;o &s;hort a
Compa&s;s of Time. And it was upon the good
Management, and Succe&s;s of this Expedition,
that he has been rank'd with the greate&s;t of
the <HI>Athenian</HI> Captains; tho' his Name and A|ctions
being not &s;o generally recorded, have
con&s;equently made le&s;s Noi&s;e in the World.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> at this time fini&s;h'd their <HI>long
Walls,</HI> Which join'd the City to the Port, and
which they had begun after the la&s;t Defeat of
the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding their
many Divi&s;$ers, the Siege of <HI>aegina</HI> had been
carry'd on with$ur I$ruption; and the Inha|bitants
now yielding it up, had no other Terms
<PB N="251" REF="284">
given them, than to ra&s;e the Walls, deliver up
their Shipping, and pay their Tribute for the
future. The next who &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf in
<HI>Athens,</HI> was <HI>Tolmides,</HI> who out of Emulation
to the Exploits of <HI>myronides,</HI> coa&s;ted <HI>Peloponne|sus</HI>
with fifty Gallies, and four thou&s;and Men
on board them, took <HI>Gytheum</HI> a Port-Town of
<HI>Laconia;</HI> where he burnt and de&s;troy'd their
Naval Forces, and hara&s;s'd the Country. From
thence he made &s;ucce&s;sful Inroads into the
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Territories, and defeated the <HI>Sicyoni|ans</HI>
in a Land Fight.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Tran&s;actions of the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
during the War in <HI>Aegypt:</HI> But about
the time of the Defeat there, a Stop was al&s;o
put to their Career in <HI>Greece.</HI> Particularly they
were foil'd in <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> attempting to rein&s;tate
<HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> who being banish'd thence, had begg'd
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. After which <HI>Pericles</HI> put to
Sea, and took much the &s;ame Compa&s;s <HI>Tolmi|des</HI>
did, but not altogether with the &s;ame Suc|ce&s;s.
He hara&s;s'd the Cities upon the Sea|Coa&s;ts,
gave the <HI>Sicyonians</HI> another Overthrow,
and taking in fre&s;h Supplies at <HI>Achaia,</HI> which
was then in League with <HI>Athens,</HI> put over to
<HI>Acarnania;</HI> but was forc'd to return without
performing any thing of Importance. The
<HI>Athenians</HI> ever &s;ince the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Tanagra,</HI>
&s;u&s;pected a Storm from <HI>Sparta:</HI> And as the E|vent
of that Action had given them cau&s;e to
repent their ill U&s;age of <HI>Cimon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cimon <HI>re|call'd.</HI></NOTE> they thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to their Affairs at this Juncture, to
have him recall'd. Accordingly, when he had
been five Years in Exile, <HI>Pericles,</HI> who was
the chief In&s;trument in his Bani&s;hment, writ
the Edict for his Return. And being return'd,
<PB N="252" REF="285">
he made u&s;e of his Intere&s;t in <HI>Sparta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Procures a Peace be|twixt</HI> A|thens <HI>and</HI> Sparta.</NOTE> to recon|cile
that State to <HI>Athens;</HI> which he &s;o far ef|fected,
that a Peace was concluded betwixt 'em
for five Years.</P>
<P>Peace being e&s;tabli&s;h'd, he found the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
impatient of Ea&s;e: And lea&s;t &s;o many Ships
crui&s;ing about <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and the I&s;les, &s;hould
give fre&s;h Occa&s;ion to inte&s;tine Wars, he pro|pos'd
to make another Attempt upon <HI>Cyprus.</HI>
Tho' &s;ome &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Expe|dition to</HI> Cyprus.</NOTE> <HI>Pericles</HI> this a private Con|dition
of his Return, that he &s;hould Command
the Forces abroad upon &s;ome Expedition again&s;t
the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and leave him to govern in the
City. And it &s;eems very probable, that &s;ome|thing
of this Nature pa&s;s'd betwixt 'em,
becau&s;e <HI>Pericles</HI> had con&s;tantly taken oc|ca&s;ion,
Whil&s;t the other was abroad, to
rever&s;e all that had been done by him in favour
of the Nobility. Whatever the Motive was,
he mann'd out two hundred Gallies, and being
arriv'd at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> detach'd &s;ixty of them for
the Service in <HI>AElig;gypt.</HI> For tho' upon the la&s;t
Defeat there, <HI>Inarus</HI> was taken, and mo&s;t of the
Country reduced, he fenny Parts of it &s;till held
out under <HI>Apiyrtaus. Cimon</HI> in the mean while
over-run great Part of the I&s;land <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and
laid Siege to <HI>Citium:</HI> But lying before the
Town, (Whether &s;ick or wounded, is not de|termind'd)
and perceiving he &s;hould die, he
charg'd tho&s;e about him to conceal the News of
his Death;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Deat$,</HI></NOTE> which thy manag'd with &s;uch Se|crecy,
that the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army was conducted, as
it were, by him thirty Days after he was dead.
And having obtained a great Victory, wherein
they took an hundred of the <HI>Phoenician, Cyprian,</HI>
and <HI>Clisian</HI> Vessels, and being join'd by the
<PB N="253" REF="286">
Ships, which return'd from <HI>aegypt,</HI> they &s;ail'd
home. <HI>Diodorus</HI> in&s;inuates, that it was upon
this Defeat that memorable Peace was concluded,
which is mention'd after the Fight at <HI>Eurymedon:</HI>
But as all Writers agree as to the main Articles,
tho' not as to the time, this might probably be
the &s;ame Treaty renew'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and Cha|racter.</HI></NOTE> With <HI>Cimon</HI> in a
great Mea&s;ure fell that true Spirit of Gallantry,
which had hitherto animated a Race of Heroes
again&s;t the common Enemy. And as he was the
la&s;t, &s;o in one re&s;pect he was the greate&s;t of
them; ina&s;much as he &s;truck a greater Ter|ror
into the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> by carrying the War almo&s;t
into the Heart of his Country; and aw'd him
&s;o in the <HI>Lesser Asia,</HI> that no Officer of what
Quality, or Character soever could command
there, nor dur&s;t any Soldier appear in Arms,
within four hundred Furlongs of the Sea. As
to his Behaviour at home, he was open, and ob|liging,
and came very little &s;hort of <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI>'s
Integrity. For an In&s;tance of this latter, he
gave an hand&s;ome turn to <HI>Rae&s;aces</HI> a <HI>Persian;</HI>
who having fled from the King his Ma&s;ter, came
to him for Protection again&s;t the In&s;ults of &s;ome
of the Mob in <HI>Athens,</HI> and offer'd him two
Cups full of <HI>Darius's: Cimon</HI> ask'd him &s;mi|lingly,
<HI>Whether he would have him to he his
Mercenary, or his Friend?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>His
Friend. Why then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>take away your
Mony: For as &s;uch, I presume it is at my Ser|vice,
whenever I shall have occa&s;ion for it; and
when I have, I'll &s;end to you.</HI> What Riches
he had got by the Wars, he employ'd to &s;o
good U&s;es, that he was rather to be accounted
Charitable than Profu&s;e, keeping an open Hou&s;e,
and laving down the Inclosures about it for the
<PB N="254" REF="287">
Benefit of the Poor; and that without any po|pular
De&s;ign, further than by &s;uch good Offi|ces
to re&s;train a Spirit of Faction, which he &s;aw
was breaking in upon the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Soon after the&s;e Tran&s;actions abroad, hap|pen'd
a Quarrel about the Temple at <HI>Delphi,</HI>
from whence it was call'd the <HI>Holy War.</HI> The
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> taking it from the <HI>Phocians,</HI> who
had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, gave it up to the Inha|bitants:
But immediately upon their Depar|ture,
<HI>Pericles</HI> came with a Body of <HI>Athenians,</HI>
and put the <HI>Phocians</HI> in again. And now the
<HI>Boeotians</HI> beginning to revolt, the <HI>Athenians</HI>
&s;eiz'd &s;everal of their Towns, and garri&s;on'd
them: But the <HI>Boeotians</HI> being join'd by their
Neighbours, &s;urpris'd them in their Return, and
at <HI>Coronea</HI> cut off the greate&s;t part of their
Forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battel at</HI> Coro|nea.</NOTE> with <HI>Tolmides</HI> their General, and took
the re&s;t Pri&s;oners; to redeem whom, the <HI>Atheni|ans</HI>
were forc'd to re&s;tore them to their Coun|try,
and Liberty. As the Event of this Acti|on
&s;erv'd mightily to rai&s;e the Peoples E&s;teem
of <HI>Pericles,</HI> who had us'd his utmo&s;t Efforts to
di&s;&s;uade <HI>Tolmides</HI> from it, as a ra&s;h Enterpri&s;e,
and ill-tim'd; &s;o it encourag'd the <HI>Euboeans</HI> to
make head: And <HI>Pericles</HI> was no &s;ooner landed
in the I&s;land to cha&s;ti&s;e them, but News came,
that <HI>Megara</HI> had al&s;o revolted; and that the
<HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> were hara&s;&s;ing the Borders of
<HI>Attica.</HI> Upon which he quitted this War,
to attend that which threaten'd home: Where
in&s;tead of putting it to the I&s;&s;ue of a Battel, he
practis'd with <HI>Pli&s;toanax</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> King, and
by the means of <HI>Cleandrides</HI> (whom the <HI>Ephor$</HI>
had &s;ent with him by rea&s;on of his Youth, a$
his A&s;&s;i&s;tant) bought him off. <HI>Pericles</HI> in gi|ving
<PB N="255" REF="288">
up his Accounts of this Expedition, had
&s;et down a Disbur&s;ement of ten Talents, as
laid out upon a nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ion; and the
People without troubling them&s;elves to canva&s;s
the My&s;tery, freely allow'd of it. It is added
further, that he had his yearly Pen&s;sioners in
<HI>Sparta;</HI> and con&s;tantly &s;ent the &s;ame Sum for
the &s;ame &s;ecret Service: By which means the
War was kept off, 'till the <HI>Athenians</HI> were pro|vided.
Tis &s;aid the <HI>Spartans</HI> fin'd their King
in &s;uch a Sum, that not being able to pay it,
he quitted his Country; and his Counsellor,
who had fled for it, was sentenc'd to Death.
However <HI>Attica</HI> being freed, <HI>Pericles</HI> repairs
again to <HI>Euboea;</HI> and having reduc'd the whole
I&s;land, bani&s;h'd the Inhabitants of <HI>Hestioea,</HI> for
having kill'd the Men on board an <HI>Attick</HI> Ship
they had taken, and in their room brought in a
Colony of his own Citizens. All Parties being
rather tir'd than &s;atisfy'd with this Variety of
Fortune, began to hearken to a Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A general Peace.</HI></NOTE> which
was at la&s;t concluded between <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>La|cedoemon</HI>
for thirty Years, the Allies of both
Sides being included.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M.</NOTE> So that the <HI>Athenians</HI>
were forc'd to evacuate mo&s;t of the Towns they
had garri&s;on'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3557.</NOTE> and it was further provided,
that whatever City had not yet declar'd, &s;hould
be at liberty to join with either Side, as Oc|ca&s;ion
&s;hould &s;erve. At the &s;ame time <HI>Dio|dorus</HI>
ob&s;erves, there was a general Peace in all
Parts.</P>
<P>III. During this Interval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 83. 2</NOTE> it may not be
improper to take a Survey of <HI>Athens;</HI> where
<HI>Pericles</HI> was &s;till improving his Intere&s;t with the
People. But as they found <HI>Cimon</HI>'s Death had
<PB N="256" REF="289">
put him in a Capacity of carrying his De&s;igns
further than they could allow of, they &s;et up
<HI>Thucydides</HI> again&s;t him, a Man &s;ober and di&s;creet,
and related to <HI>Cimon.</HI> And tho' he was not &s;o
profe&s;s'd a Soldier as he, he was better vers'd
in the Courts of Law, and Bu&s;ine&s;s of State,
and in that re&s;pect a more &s;uitable Match for his
Competitor. He having &s;ever'd out the be&s;t
&s;ort of Men, who before pa&s;s'd undi&s;tingui&s;h'd
among the Multitude, form'd them into a Bo|dy,
which pa&s;s'd under the Name of <HI>The Few,</HI>
or the <HI>Great Ones,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Com|mons.</HI>
And tho' this Di&s;tinction could not but
create &s;ome Di&s;turbances, it &s;erv'd how|ever
as a Counter-poi&s;e to the State in ge|neral,
which apprehended lets from the Contention
of two e&s;tabli&s;h'd Parties, than from the
uncontroul'd Power of one Man. <HI>Pericles in</HI>
the mean while manag'd his Affairs with &s;uch
Nicety, that he temper'd all his Actions with
an Air of greater Advantage to the State, than
him&s;elf. Such was his &s;ending &s;ixty Gallies
yearly, with a proportionable Number of the
Citizens on board them, as a <HI>Nur&s;ery</HI> for Sea|men.
Such was his planting another Part of
them in the late Conque&s;ts, and dividing the
Lands among them by Lot. As by the&s;e Me|thods
he aw'd both the Enemies and Allies of
<HI>Athens,</HI> &s;o he provided for the Nece&s;&s;itous,
and had a further End in di&s;charging the City
of the Idle, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t bu&s;ie
and inqui&s;itive part of the People. Then to
cajole, and amu&s;e tho&s;e who were left, he en|tertain'd
them with publick Shews, Fea&s;ts, and
other Solemnities. And to keep them general|ly
employ'd, and make &s;ome &s;hew of the va&s;t
<PB N="257" REF="290">
Sums he expended in the&s;e Projects, he &s;et to
beautifying the City far beyond what his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors
had attempted. He gave &s;uch En|couragement,
as produc'd &s;trange &s;ort of E|mulation
in all kinds of Arti&s;ts: So that <HI>Athens</HI>
on a &s;udden became <HI>one continu'd Ornament.</HI>
As a Specimen of the re&s;t, he re&s;tor'd and en|larg'd
the <HI>Parthenion,</HI> or Temple of <HI>Minerva</HI>
burnt by the <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> which is &s;aid to be even
at this Day both for Matter and Art, the mo&s;t
beautiful Piece of Antiquity remaining in the
World. It was from this time, that <HI>Athens</HI>
came to be &s;o much admir'd by Strangers, and
envy'd by her Neighbours: And this Politene&s;s,
Pomp, and Luxury in Building, &s;eems to have
laid the Foundation of the &s;ame Exce&s;s, to
which &s;he &s;oon after arriv'd in other things.
But <HI>Pericles</HI> by this gave occa&s;ion to his Ene|mies,
to reproach him with &s;quandering away
the Mony, which was given for the Mainte|nance
of the War. They complain'd in the po|pular
A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>That it was what they could
not an&s;wer either to them&s;elves, or their Allies;
that they had no Pretence for moving the Bank of
Greece from Delos, but to &s;ecure it from the
Barbarians; and that he had broke the Neck of
that Excu&s;e, by diverting it to other U&s;es. Pe|ricles</HI>
urg'd in Defence of him&s;elf, and the
State, <HI>That they were no way accountable to their
Confederates, who did not &s;o much as &s;et out Ship,
Man, or Hor&s;e for the Service, whil&s;t they were
continually expo&s;ing them&s;elves in their Defence:
That as for the Mony, it was not theirs who
gave, but theirs who receiv'd it, &s;o long as they
perform'd the Conditions, upon which they receiv'd.</HI>
He added &s;urther, <HI>That it was &s;it the Handi|craft&s;men
<PB N="258" REF="291">
&s;hould have their Share in the pub|lick,
Mony, and yet that they &s;hould do &s;ome|thing
for it; and that &s;ince they were &s;ufficienty
&s;tor'd with Provi&s;ions for the War, they might
very fairly convert the Overplus to the &V;&s;e, and
Ornament of the City.</HI> This &s;alved the Bu&s;ine&s;s
for the pre&s;ent: And when at another time
<HI>Thucydides</HI>'s Party was railing at him upon the
&s;ame Account, he put the Que&s;tion to the Peo|ple,
<HI>Whether they thought he had laid out too
much?</HI> They told him, <HI>Yes. Well then,</HI> &s;ays
he, <HI>let it all go upon my Account, and accord|ingly
I'll make the In&s;criptions upon the Temples,
and other publick Buildings, in my own Name.</HI>
Whether they were &s;truck with the Greatne&s;s of
his Spirit in this Reply, or that they envy'd him
the Glory of the Works, they unanimou&s;ly
bid him go on, and fini&s;h 'em at the publick

<P>The fir&s;t new Di&s;turbance happen'd &s;ix Years

them&s;elves in the Quarrel, being al&s;o encourag'd
to it by a di&s;gu&s;ted Party of the <HI>Samians</HI> them|&s;elves.
<HI>Pericles</HI> appear'd &s;o particularly warm in
it, that the State took notice of it; and the ra|ther
becau&s;e what he did, was thought to be
at the In&s;tigation of <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia</HI> a <HI>Mile&s;ian</HI>
Mi&s;tre&s;s of his. He mann'd out forty Gallies, and made
a De&s;cent upon <HI>Samos;</HI> where breaking up the
<HI>Oligarehy,</HI> he e&s;tabli&s;h'd a <HI>Democracy</HI> after the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Model; then taking Ho&s;tages, tran|&s;ported

Corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the leading Men

their Ho&s;tages privately convey'd from <HI>Lemnos,</HI>
deliver'd up the <HI>Athenian</HI> Garri&s;on to <HI>Pi&s;&s;uthnes;</HI>
then drew <HI>Byzantium</HI> into their Alliance, and
renew'd the War with the <HI>Mile&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pericles</HI> having Notice of this Surpri&s;e, put
to Sea again with &s;ixty Sail: With forty four

a &s;ignal Victory, having taken, &s;unk, and
routed the whole <HI>Samian</HI> Elect con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy
Sail, twenty of which were Men of War.
Having by this Means made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of
the Port, he pur&s;u'd his Victory by Land,
and block'd, up the City. But in&s;tead of pre&s;|&s;ing
the Siege, he went with a fre&s;h Supply of
Ships in que&s;t of the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Fleet, which
he heard was coming to the Relief of the be|&s;ieg'd;
who in the mean time finding great De|tachments
drawn off; made a &s;ucce&s;sful Saily,
and recover'd the Harbour; &s;o that having an
open Sea, they imported all their nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions.
But <HI>Pericles</HI> being return'd with &s;till
greater Supplies from home, which were al&s;o
augmented by a Fleet of <HI>Chians and Lesbi|ans,</HI>
he hemm'd them in with a Wall, and
made u&s;e of battering Engines: So that with

<HI>Athens,</HI> and under the popular Government.
The War being over, <HI>Byzantium</HI> al&s;o return'd
to its &s;ormer Obedience. This was the chief
of <HI>Pericles's</HI> military Exploits; and he could
not help valuing him&s;elf upon it &s;o far, as to
&s;ay, <HI>He had in nine Months done as much a|gain&s;t
the chief City of</HI> Ionia, <HI>as</HI> Agamemnon
<HI>did in ten Years again&s;t</HI> Troy. The truth is,
he met with more Hazard and Difficulty, than
he was aware of, the <HI>Samians</HI> being arriv'd to
that Power by Sea, that they were within ve|ry

<P>IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stirs at</HI> E|pidamnus.</NOTE> The next Commotions were about two
Years after at <HI>Epidamnus,</HI> and require a di&s;tinct
Relation, as they give light to the Sequel of
the Story, and are the common reputed Grounds
of that Flame, which was kindled in all <HI>Greece.
Epidamnus,</HI> afterwards known by the Name of
<HI>Dyrrachium,</HI> was a Colony of the <HI>Corcyaeans;</HI>
which growing fir&s;t Rich, and then Factious,
bani&s;h'd the chief of her Citizens. The Exiles
joining with the <HI>Illyrians</HI> their Neighbours,
brought the <HI>Epidamnians</HI> &s;o low, that they
were forc'd to &s;end to <HI>Corcyra</HI> their Mother
City for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which rejecting their Re|que&s;t,
the Oracle directed them to the <HI>Corin|thians,
as their Original Founders.</HI> For as <HI>Cor|cyra</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="294">
was their Founder, &s;o <HI>Corinth</HI> was the <HI>Cor|cyraeans;</HI>
and <HI>Phalius</HI> the Po&s;terity of <HI>Her|cules,</HI>
who led the Colony into <HI>Epidamnus,</HI>
was him&s;elf a <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and carry'd &s;everal of
his Countrymen with him. Accordingly up|on
their giving up them&s;elves, and their City
to them, they took them under their Protecti|on,
but not more out of Pity to them, than
out of a Pique to <HI>Corcyra;</HI> whole Wealth, and
Naval Power, wherein &s;he was little inferior
to any State in <HI>Greece,</HI> had made her in&s;olent,
&s;o as to throw off all manner of Dependance on
them, even to the common Marks of Acknow|ledgement,
exacted as due from a Colony to its
<HI>Metropolis.</HI> The <HI>Corinthians</HI> having &s;ent &s;ome
new Inhabitants to <HI>Epidamnus</HI> with a Garri&s;on
to &s;ecure them, the <HI>Corcyroeans</HI> re&s;ented it as
interpo&s;ing in their Affairs; and going with a
Fleet to <HI>Epidamnus,</HI> commanded the Citizens
to receive their Exiles, and expel the <HI>Corin|thians;</HI>
and upon their po&s;itive Refu&s;al block'd
them up. In the mean time, when they &s;ound
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> preparing to relieve them, they
offer'd to refer it to any indifferent City of <HI>Pe|loponne&s;us,</HI>
as to the Right of the Colony. But
the <HI>Corinthians</HI> re&s;olving to humble them,
&s;ent a Fleet of &s;eventy five Gallies with two
thou&s;and Soldiers on board them. The <HI>Cor|cyroeans</HI>
had an hundred and twenty Sail; forty
of which being left to carry on the Siege,
they made up to them with the re&s;t near the
Promontory of <HI>Actium,</HI> and defeated them:
And to make it a compleat Victory, <HI>Epi|damnus</HI>
was &s;urrender'd up to 'em the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="295">
Being now Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e Seas, they infe|&s;ted
the other Colonies, and Confederates of
<HI>Corinth.</HI> But the Summer following, the <HI>Co|rinthians</HI>
made very great Preparations in order
to revenge this $word$: Which the others
having Notice of, laid their Ca&s;e before the
<HI>Athenians,</HI> in&s;i&s;ting upon the Article of their
late Treaty with the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians,</HI> which gave
them leave to take any State, that had not been
engag'd, into their Alliance. The <HI>Corinthians</HI>
at the &s;ame time put in their Remonstrances:
And after a full hearing on both, Sides, and
two A&s;&s;emblies of the People, they concluded
<HI>Coreyra</HI> was a Place of too great Importance, in
regard both of its own Strength, and as it was
a convenient Pa&s;s into <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> to let it
be an Acce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Corinth.</HI> Yet as on the o|ther
Hand they were tender of violating the
Peace, they made only a Defen&s;ive League
with it, giving their Officers in Charge to de|cline
the Fight, unle&s;s the <HI>Corcyoeans</HI> or they
were fir&s;t attack'd. Accordingly they voted
an Aid of ten Gal$ies: But the &s;ending &s;o &s;mall
a Sq$adron was look'd upon rather as an Hard|ship
upon <HI>Lacedaemonius</HI> the Son of <HI>Cimon,</HI>
who commanded them, than a Relief to <HI>Corcyra;</HI>
and as it &s;tuck chiefly upon <HI>Pericles,</HI> who did
all he could to hinder the Ri&s;e of <HI>Cimon's</HI> Fa|mily,
he was forc'd to procure a new Supply;
but it came too late to do much Service.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Eight between the Corcy$ae|ans, and Corinthi|ans.</HI></NOTE> The
<HI>Corinthians</HI> putting to Sea with ninety Ships of

met 'em betwixt their I&s;land and the

was their greaten Number, that had hitherto
<PB N="263" REF="296">
been engag'd of the <HI>Grecians</HI> among them&s;elves,
&s;o the Fight was long and ob&s;tinate, but artle&s;s,
and confus'd, and rather de&s;perate, than deci|&s;ive.
For tho' the <HI>Corcyraeans</HI> lo&s;t &s;eventy Sail
for thirty of the Enemy, and a hundred Pri&s;o|ners;
yet as upon the Arrival of twenty Sail
more from <HI>Athens,</HI> they kept the Sea, recover'd
a great part of their Wreck, and dead Bodies,
and made another Offer of Battel, which was
not accepted, this made the Claim of Victory
&s;o equal, that both Sides erected Trophies.
Whatever Advantage the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had, they
did not care to par&s;ue it; &s;o that being content
to leave <HI>Corcyra,</HI> rather &s;a&s;e than victorious,
they return'd home, having in their Pa&s;&s;age
taken <HI>Anactorium</HI> a Town in the Bay of <HI>Am|bracia.</HI>
But they complain'd loudly of the <HI>A|thenians,</HI>
as having violated the Treaty, in
which taey were compris'd with <HI>Lacedoemon:</HI>
And this was the fir&s;t Pretence of the general
War which follow'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fir&s;t Grounds of the</HI> Pelo|ponne&s;ian <HI>War.</HI></NOTE> What they call'd the

and finding it mu&s;t come to an open
Rupture, thought it the wife&s;t it Cour&s;e to be
before-hand with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly they &s;ent to the Inhabitants of
<HI>Potidaea,</HI> a Town in the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Pallene</HI> a
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Colony, but tributary to <HI>Athens,</HI> to
demoli&s;h their Walls towards <HI>Pallene,</HI> to give
Ho&s;tages, to expel their Magi&s;trates &s;ent year|ly
to them from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and to receive no
more of them for the future. They had fir&s;t
Recour&s;e to Entreaties, that nothing of Extre|mity
might be put upon them; but when they
<PB N="264" REF="297">
could get no Abatement of the&s;e Terms, they
went with the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Spar|ta,</HI>
and obtain'd an A&s;&s;urance that in Ca&s;e the
<HI>Athenians</HI> made War upon them, the <HI>Lacedae|monians</HI>
would enter <HI>Attica</HI> with an Army.
They had further Encouragement from <HI>Per|diccas</HI>
the <HI>Macedonian</HI> King, who having at
that time a Quarrel with the <HI>Athenians</HI> for A&s;&s;i&s;ting
his Brothers again&s;t him, procur'd &s;eve|ral

However the <HI>Athenians</HI> went on with
their De&s;igns, having before &s;ent Orders to the
Captains of the thirty Gallies they had in tho&s;e
Parts, to &s;ee their Commands executed upon
<HI>Potidaea,</HI> and to have a watchful Eye upon its
Neighbours. But being too weak to deal with
<HI>Perdiccas,</HI> and the revolted Cities at the &s;ame
time, they receiv'd a Supply of forty Gallies
with two thou&s;and Men under the Conduct of
<HI>Callias.</HI> The Forces on both Sides being join'd,
a Batted en&s;u'd, wherein one of the <HI>Athenian</HI>

the <HI>Corinthian</HI> General perceiving, gave

in this Action lo&s;t but a hundred and
fifty Men, among&s;t whom was <HI>Callias,</HI> and the

it was a Victory on the <HI>Athenians</HI> Side; who

<PB N="265" REF="298">
As the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Corcyra</HI> was urg'd again&s;t
the <HI>Athenians,</HI> &s;o was this of <HI>Potidaea</HI> again&s;t
the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians;</HI> and may be look'd upon as
the &s;econd Pretence for the War, ina&s;much as

their Allegiance to <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P>The Noi&s;e of this Siege brought the <HI>Corin|thian</HI>
Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Sparta;</HI> where they and
all other States, which had any Inju&s;tice to

the <HI>Corinthians</HI> made a long Speech to them;

de&s;ir'd they might have leave to exceed their
Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o far, as to refute what Envy and
Prejudice had &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t their Fellow+Citizens.
They began with a Recapitulation
of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars; wherein the whole Bur|den

unavoidable Steps the chief Power was
devolv'd upon them; <HI>That having receivd that

and yet that they had employ'd no more, than was

the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> not to entertain any unju&s;t

before they enter'd upon a War of the la&s;t
Importance; for that <HI>Whoever &s;hould begin with
the</HI> Athenians, <HI>would certainly find them ready to
retaliate.</HI> The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> after a full and
open Hearing came to a clo&s;e Debate among
them&s;elves; wherein it was generally agreed,
that the Peace was broke, and that the <HI>Athe|nian</HI>
were the Agre&s;&s;ors; The Di&s;pute was,
whether they &s;hould immediately declare War.
<HI>Archidamus</HI> one of their Kings, and a Man of
Prudence, and Temper, told 'em, <HI>They were
not at this time a Match for</HI> Athens; and en|deavour'd
to di&s;&s;uade them not to much from
the War in general, as from ru&s;hing into it
thoughtle&s;s, and unprovided. But <HI>Sthenelaidas</HI>
one of the <HI>Ephori</HI> urg'd the contrary, <HI>That
when once they had receiv'd an Injury, they
ought not to deliberate, but forthwith to proceed to
Action,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>War de|creed at</HI> Sparta</NOTE> <HI>and revenge it.</HI> And accordingly War

<P>Whil&s;t they were making Preparations,

to make the War appear more &s;peci|ous
on their Side, &s;ent &s;everal Emba&s;&s;ies to
expo&s;tulate with the <HI>Athenians.</HI> They began
with the old Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Cylon;</HI> which was le|vell'd
<PB N="267" REF="300">
again&s;t <HI>Pericles</HI> their Mortal Enemy,
who&s;e Relations by his Mother's Side were
&s;aid to be tainted with that Pollution. But
he charg'd them with the &s;ame Guilt in the
Death of <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> and &s;ome of their <HI>Helots,</HI>
who had taken Sanctuary in the Temple. Then
they requir'd them to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Poti|daea;</HI>
to permit <HI>Aegina</HI> to be govern'd by its
own Laws; and to revoke the Decree again&s;t
the <HI>Megareans;</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon
this latter, that they &s;eem'd to lay the whole
Stre&s;s of the War upon it. Receiving no &s;a|tisfactory
An&s;wer to the&s;e Propo&s;als, they
made another more general Demand, <HI>That they
&s;hould &s;et free all the</HI> Grecian <HI>Cities, which
had any Dependence on them.</HI> Which as it
was in effect confining their Juri&s;diction with|in
their own Walls, they could not expect they
would con&s;ent to it: However it an&s;wer'd
their De&s;ign, which was only to amu&s;e them,
and gain time. The <HI>Athenians</HI> upon this la&s;t
Me&s;&s;age a&s;&s;embled the People, in order to &s;end
a peremptory An&s;wer once for all. The Mat|ter
was canva&s;s'd long, and with great variety
of Opinions; 'till at la&s;t it was fix'd by <HI>Peri|cles,</HI>
who oppos'd their Demands with a great
deal of Warmth, and Artifice, &s;hewing, <HI>That
tho' &s;ame of them were not in them&s;elves &s;uffici|ent
Grounds for a War, yet that the Con&s;equence
of their Conce&s;&s;ion even in Trifles, when it was
extorted from them with an Air of Command,
would be, to have &s;till more impos'd upon them:
That as to the Succe&s;s. they might promi&s;e them|&s;elves
a con&s;iderable &s;hare from the many diffe|rent
Intere&s;ts of the Con&s;ederates, whereby their
Coun&s;els being divided, they would never come
<PB N="298" REF="301">
to any &s;udden Re&s;olve; and that if they could, yet
their want of Mony would keep 'em from putting
it in Execution. That as to them&s;elves, their
Shipping would enable them to give powerful Di|ver&s;ions,
by making frequent De&s;cents: And be|cau&s;e
their Strength con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in I&s;lands,
having only</HI> Attica, <HI>that lay open to the Depreda|tions

ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity there was of a War; and that
the more chearfully they undertook it, the ea&s;ier
it would be di&s;patch'd: That as the greate&s;t Ho|nours
had generally accru'd to their State out of
the greate&s;t Extremities, this might &s;erve to
animate them in its Defence, &s;o as not to tran&s;|mit

<P>Having mention'd the pretended Grounds of

<PB N="269" REF="302">
<HI>Pericles</HI> was per&s;onally intere&s;ted in promoting
this War, in&s;omuch that &s;ome have charg'd him as
the &s;ole Author of it. 'Tis certain, he was
va&s;tly indebted to the State, which had often
threaten'd calling him to Account: So that not|with&s;tanding
his great Power in the City, he
thought it too precarious, to &s;creen him a|gain&s;t
the continual Clamours about the publick
Mony. This private Storm he thought was not
to be diverted, but by a publick one; and there|fore
to take the People off from their Enquiries,
and to make his A&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary, he invol|ved
them in this War. It is &s;aid further, that
he took the fir&s;t Hint of it from his Nephew
<HI>Alcibiades;</HI> who &s;eeing him one Day very pen|&s;ive
and melancholy, ask'd him the rea&s;on of it.
He told him, <HI>He was con&s;idering how to make
up his Accounts to the State. You were better
con&s;ider,</HI> replies the Youth, <HI>how to avoid being
accountable.</HI> This was undoubtedly a &s;trong
Motive with <HI>Pericles</HI> in inflaming the Quarrel,
when once it was on foot: But for the War it
&s;elf, it was what mu&s;t have broke out of Cour&s;e
about this time, without any particular Incendi|ary.
For the true Cau&s;e of it was the Power
of <HI>Athens;</HI> and the Seeds of it were laid from
the time of the Battel at <HI>Plataea.</HI> That Day &s;o
glorious to <HI>Greece,</HI> became fatal to her in the
Con&s;equence, by di&s;&s;olving that Subordination
<HI>Athens</HI> bore to <HI>Sparta,</HI> and rai&s;ing eternal Jea|lou&s;ies
betwixt the two States. <HI>Athens</HI> fi$'d
with the Succe&s;s of the Battels again&s;t the <HI>Per|&s;ian,</HI>
the chief Honour of which &s;he took to
her &s;elf, fir&s;t &s;tood upon Equality with <HI>Lace|daemon,</HI>
and then carry'd her Preten&s;ions a
great deal higher. She &s;oon affected a Pre|cedency;
<PB N="270" REF="303">
drew over to her Side the greate&s;t
part of the Allies; debated, and decided what|ever
concern'd the general Welfare; a&s;&s;um'd to
her &s;elf the Prerogative of Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments;
and in a word, &s;et up for the <HI>Sove|reign
&V;mpire of</HI> Greece. The <HI>Athenians</HI> had
indeed a very fair Title to the Command at
Sea; and <HI>Sparta</HI> was not very unwilling to re|&s;ign
it to them: But they would be ab&s;olute
in all. They thought, &s;ince they had deliver'd
<HI>Greece</HI> from the In&s;ults of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> they
had a Right to oppre&s;s her in their Turn. They
roughly treated the <HI>Grecian Cities,</HI> of which
they call'd them&s;elves the <HI>Protectors.</HI> If a
Neighbour offended them never &s;o little, he
&s;oon felt the Weight of all their Anger; whence
grew that Proverb recited by <HI>Ari&s;totle, An</HI>
Athenian <HI>Neighbourhood.</HI> They render'd them|&s;elves
odious not only to their Neighbours, but
al&s;o to part of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the I&s;les of the
<HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, which were &s;ubject to their Laws,
but impatiently bore that Yoke, which grew
every Day more in&s;upportable. Thus did
<HI>Athens</HI> manage her &s;elf for above forty Years:
All which time the <HI>Spartans</HI> made but faint At|tempts
to humble, or repre&s;s their Rivals.
Their Method, when any injur'd State appeal'd
to them, was to referem to <HI>Athens,</HI> that by
engaging her in the Quarrel, they might weak|en,
and di&s;&s;olve her Power, and yet not at their
own Expence. But the Effect was &s;o far from
an&s;wering what they propos'd, that it &s;erv'd
rather to fix and heighten her E&s;teem. <HI>Pericles</HI>
made the City &s;till more formidable to the other
Common-wealths, by the &s;everal Emba&s;&s;ies $word$
caus'd it to depute, either upon its real $$$$|tended
<PB N="271" REF="304">
Intere&s;ts; and improv'd the&s;e Negotia|tions
into a great De&s;ign of &s;ummoning all
<HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Athens,</HI> in order to enter into a more
&s;trict Con&s;ederacy again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> Which
was &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of Pre-eminence,
as the <HI>Athenians</HI> had never before a&s;&s;um'd to
them&s;elves: And the <HI>Lacedam$nians</HI> could not
but re&s;ent it, when they found they were to
be conven'd before them, like the re&s;t of their
Tributaries. Whatever they had hitherto con|niv'd
at, they did not care to te&s;tifie their
Submi&s;&s;ion, and Dependance in &s;o &s;olemn a Man|ner:
And tho' the thing did not take Effect,
it &s;erv'd however to awaken them into a Sen&s;e
of the Nece&s;&s;ity there was, of putting a Stop to
their Career. So that upon this, and the re|peated
Complaints of &s;everal Cities, they found
there was no way left, but to make a formal De|claration
of War. In a word the two States
were throughly exa&s;perated by a long Emulation;
and as they were both arriv'd to their mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing
Period, this was a Di&s;pute betwixt 'em
for the <HI>Empire of Greece,</HI> the Pretence for
for which was, <HI>pre&s;erving the Ballance, and pro|tecting
their Confederates.</HI></P>
<P>About the time of the&s;e Commotions, flou|ri&s;h'd
<HI>Meton</HI> the <HI>A&s;tronomer</HI> of <HI>Athens;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meton.</NOTE> who
found out that notable Period of nineteen Years,
in which Space all the different Mutations of
the Sun and Moon are compleated, and they
begin again to move from the &s;ame Point of
the <HI>Zodiack.</HI> This became a Standard among
the Ancients in calculating the Full and New
Moons; and the Di&s;covery was receiv'd with
&s;uch Applau&s;e by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that they
would have it writ in <HI>Golden Letters</HI> in the mo&s;t

the Title of the <HI>Golden Number;</HI> which was
handed down from the <HI>Grecians</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
and from them to us <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> But &s;ome
will not allow <HI>Meton</HI> to have been the Author
of this <HI>Cycle: Livy</HI> particularly attributes the
Invention of it to <HI>Numa Pompilius.</HI> It was al|&s;o
about this time that <HI>Pindar</HI> dy'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pindar.</NOTE> who was
born at <HI>Thebes</HI> about the &s;ixty fourth <HI>Olympiad.</HI>
The manner of his Death is related, that ha|ving
pray'd to the Gods to give him the mo&s;t
de&s;irable thing in Life, he dy'd &s;uddenly, l$an|ing
his Head upon a Boy that he lov'd. His
Writings have given us a Standard of the great|e&s;t
Elevation and Tran&s;port, to which it is
po&s;&s;ible for Poetry to be advanc'd. There is
&s;omething &s;o va&s;t in his De&s;igns, &s;o &s;trong,
and lively in his Thoughts, and &s;o pompous
and daring in his Expre&s;&s;ions, and Mea&s;ures,
that it requires &s;carce le&s;s Attention to read
him, than to imitate others. For which Rea|&s;ons
his Mu&s;e has been cen&s;ur'd as too unbrid|led
and irregular. But the De&s;ign of an <HI>Ode</HI>
being not &s;o much to inform our Judgment, as
to rai&s;e our Fancy, this <HI>Irregularity</HI> is not the
lea&s;t of his <HI>Beauties.</HI> It is agreeable to the Rap|ture
the Poet feels; his Spirits are too much in
a Ferment, and his Fancy too much upon the
Wing, to &s;tay for Words to expre&s;s him&s;elf
Methodically. It is the bolde&s;t &s;ort of Paint|ing;
he gives a ma&s;terly Touch here and there,
and takes the Likene&s;s of his <HI>Hero</HI> in general,
tho' he does not fini&s;h the Features. Thus
it is, that he has triumph'd over Art &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully,

them&s;elves from their Numbers, they ought
not only to allow Room for Accidents, but to
con&s;ider further how powerful, and de&s;perate an

Re&s;pect to him (as indeed there was &s;omething

it would rather do him an Injury, in lay|ing
him open to the Su&s;picion and Ill-will of
his Fellow-Citizens, he declar'd to them, <HI>That
if the Enemy forbore his E&s;tate, he would give
it to the Publick.</HI> He al&s;o order'd tho&s;e who who
were di&s;pers'd in the Villages, to retire
with their Effects into the City, as the only
Place of Security; and encourag'd them by a
long Detail of their Provi&s;ions; as <HI>That they
had &s;ix hundred Talents yearly Tribute, be&s;ides
other Revenues; that they had yet left in the Ca|&s;tle
&s;ix thou&s;and Talents, be&s;ides great Quanti|ties
of Mony and Plate belonging to the Temples,
which they might u&s;e in Ca&s;es of Extremity,
provided they made Re&s;titution when the War was
over: That they had between thirty and forty
Thou&s;and Men, three hundred Gallies, and other
Nece&s;&s;aries, which if rightly apply'd, would ca&s;ily
make them Superior.</HI> The People were &s;o well

<HI>Boeotia;</HI> from whence <HI>Archidamus,</HI> after
a fruitle&s;s Attempt to Storm the Place, was
$orc'd to march further into the Country. For

this la&s;t Delay, he had given the People of
<HI>Attica</HI> Time to gather them&s;elves into a Body,
who otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have &s;ell into their Hands.

Alarm was no &s;ooner got into the City, but
the People were ready to mutiny again&s;t <HI>Peri|cles,</HI>
for not leading them into the Field. He
thought it by no Means advi&s;eable; and there|fore
would not &s;o much as convene them, lea&s;t
the Surpri&s;e &s;hould make them re&s;olve upon
any thing that was ra&s;h, or extravagant: In|&s;omuch
that <HI>Cleon,</HI> who was endeavouring to
&s;upplant him in his Intere&s;t with the People,
reproach'd him with downright Cowardi&s;e.
He cho&s;e rather to put up every thing, than
to venture a Sally: But to &s;hew, that he did not
neglect his Charge, he &s;hut up the City Gates;
plac'd &s;ufficient Guards at all the Po&s;ts about
it; &s;ent out Parties of Hor&s;e to keep the Ene|my
at a Di&s;tance, one of which in a Skirmi&s;h
with the <HI>Boeotians</HI> was repuls'd with Lo&s;s; and
at the &s;ame time order'd out a hundred Ga|lies,
to inte&s;t the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peloponne&s;us. Ar|chidamus</HI>
finding his Provi&s;ions fail, and that
he could not bring the <HI>Athenians</HI> to a Battel,
broke up his Camp at <HI>Acharna,</HI> and having ra|vag'd
the Country about it, return'd home;
and the rather becau&s;e the <HI>Athenian</HI> Fleet in
Conjunction with the Allies, was likely to make
&s;ucce&s;sful De&s;cents. They landed in <HI>Laconia,</HI>
and had taken <HI>Methone,</HI> if <HI>Bra&s;idas</HI> a <HI>Spar|tan</HI>
had not thrown him&s;elf into the Town
with a Supply, and beat them back to their
Ships: For which Service he was the fir&s;t in
this War, who receiv'd publick Applau&s;e at
<PB N="278" REF="312">
<HI>Sparta.</HI> From thence coa&s;ting along, they put
in an <HI>Elis,</HI> where they hara$'d the Country,
plunder'd <HI>Pheia,</HI> and defeated tho&s;e who op|pos'd
them. About the &s;ame Time another
Squadron of Thirty Gallies, which was &s;ent as
a Guard to <HI>Euboea,</HI> had the like Succe&s;s again&s;t
the <HI>Loc$i Opuntii.</HI> Upon the Enemies quit|ting
<HI>Attica,</HI> the <HI>Athenians</HI> decreed, that an hun|dred
of the be&s;t Gallies, and a thou&s;and Ta|lents
&s;hould be &s;et apart in Cafe of an Inva|&s;ion
by Sea; and made it Capital for any Man
to motion the diverting either the Ships, or
Mony to any other U&s;e. They al&s;o took Oc|ca&s;ion
to di&s;place the <HI>aeginetans,</HI> upon Pre|tence
that they principally occa&s;ion'd the War:
But the Truth is, the found this Island lay
very convenient for their Afffirs, and wanted
it to ca&s;e their own City, which was prodigi|ou&s;ly
over-tock'd with Inhabitants. Then
they drew over to their Alliance <HI>Sitacles</HI> King

<P>In the Winter were &s;olemniz'd the Funeral,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fune|ral Solem/nities/s.</HI></NOTE>
of the fir&s;t &s;lain in the War. The Manner of
performing it, was to place the Bodies in Tents
three Days before the Funeral, that their Friends
might come, and pay their la&s;t Re&s;pects to
them. Upon the fourth Day a Coffin of Cy|pre&s;s
was &s;ent, one from every Tribe, to convey
the Bones of their own Relations: After which
went an empty cover'd Her&s;e in Memory of
tho&s;e, who&s;e Bodies could not he found. All
the&s;e accompany'd with the whole Body of the
People, were carry'd to the Publick Burying-Place, call'd <HI>Ceramicus,</HI> and there interr'$. The
Ceremony was concluded with one Harangue in
Prai&s;e of them all; which Task was at this Time
a&s;&s;ign'd to <HI>Pericles.</HI> The main Scope of his Speech,
was to infu&s;e Courage into the Living, by cele|brating
the Memory of the Dead, and &s;etting
before their Eyes the Glory of dying for their
Country with their Swords in their Hands,
especially for a Country &s;so glorious in all Re|&s;pects,
as was then the Common-wealth of <HI>A|thens.</HI>
And however prepo&s;terous it might
&s;eem, for him who advis'd the War, to com|memorate
tho&s;e who had lo&s;t their Lives in it;
yet probably never Man &s;ucceeded better in it;
in&s;omuch that his Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Occa|sion
is a Standard in its kind, being look$d up|on
as one of the mo&s;t artificial, and &s;l$rid
Pieces of Antiquity. Thus ended the fir&s;t
Year of the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> War.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the next Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 87. $.</NOTE> <HI>$Ar|chidamus</HI>
again invaded <HI>Attica,</HI> with the &s;ame
Number of Men as before: At which Time a

terrible Plague having travell'd over mo&s;t Parts
of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A great plague in</HI> Athens.</NOTE> arriv'd at <HI>Athens,</HI> and took off all
the Flower of its Armies both at Home and
Abroad. It &s;$iz'd them with &s;uch Violence,
that they tumbled down one upon another, as
they pa&s;s'd along the Streets. It was al&s;o at|tended
with &s;uch uncommon Exhalations of
Venom, and Putrefaction, that the very Bea&s;ts
and Birds of Prey would not touch tho&s;e who
dy'd of it: And in many of tho&s;e who reco|ver'd,
it left &s;uch a Tincture of its Malignancy,
that it &s;truck upon their Senses; it effac'd the
Notices and Memory of all the Pa&s;&s;ages of their
Lives, and they knew neither them&s;elves, nor
their neare&s;t Relations. The Circum&s;tances of this
Di&s;ea&s;e are de&s;crib'd at large by <HI>Thucydides,</HI> who
was &s;ick of it him&s;elf: And he ob&s;erves among
other Effects of it, that it introduc'd into the
City a more licentious Way of Living. For
the People at fir&s;t had Recour&s;e to their Gods,
to avert that Judgment: But finding they
were all alike infected, whether they wor&s;hipp'd
them or not, and that it was generally Mortal,
they abandon'd them&s;elves at once to De&s;pair,
and Riot. For &s;ince they held their Lives but,
as it were, by the Day, they were re&s;olv'd to
make the mo&s;t of their Time, and Mony. The
Cau&s;e of it was generally imputed to <HI>Pericles,</HI>
who by drawing &s;uch Numbers into the City,
was thought to have corrupted the very Air.
Yet tho' this was raging within, and the Ene|my
wa&s;ting the Country without, he was &s;till
of the &s;ame Mind as before, that they ought
not to put all their Hopes upon the I&s;&s;ue of a
Battel. In the mean while he put to Sea with
an hundred Gallies, and four thou&s;and Foot,
<PB N="281" REF="315">
and three hundred Hor&s;e on board them; and
being join'd by fifty Sail from <HI>Chios,</HI> and <HI>Le&s;|bos,</HI>
made an Attempt upon <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> but
mi&s;carry'd: And having committed what Spoil
he could upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> re|turn'd
home. However this prov'd a Diver&s;ion
to the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians,</HI> who partly to defend their
Territories, and partly for Fear of the Infecti|on,
quitted <HI>Attica</HI> after almo&s;t forty Days In|cur&s;ion.
The Forces employ'd by <HI>Pericles</HI>
were now &s;ent into <HI>Thrace:</HI> But the Plague
&s;wept off &s;o many of them before <HI>Potidaea,</HI> that
they did nothing con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The&s;e fruitle&s;s Expeditions &s;erv'd to incen&s;e,

cru&s;h'd with the Sword, Pe&s;tilence, and De|predations

violently again&s;t <HI>Pericles,</HI> as the &s;ole Author of
all their Calamities; and in the mean while
&s;ent to make Overtures at <HI>Sparta,</HI> but they
were not accepted. <HI>Pericles</HI> finding them thus
di&s;pirited, a&s;&s;embled them, in order to encou|rage
them to the War, by ju&s;tifying his own
Management. But his Harangue to them, how|&s;oever
forcible by tho&s;e ma&s;terly, and engaging
Strokes he gave it, had little Effect upon their
Minds, who were &s;en&s;ible of nothing but their
Misfortunes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pericles <HI>in Di&s;grace.</HI></NOTE> So that they Fin'd him in a great
Sum, and took away his Command: But find|ing
no Body fit to &s;ucceed him in &s;o weighty
a Charge, they &s;oon re&s;tor'd him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Summer <HI>Cnemus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> Ad|miral
put to Sea with an hundred Gallies, and
made a De&s;cent upon <HI>Zacynthus:</HI> But the In|habitants
continuing firm to the <HI>Athenian</HI> Inte|rest,
he only ravag'd the I&s;land, and return'd.
<PB N="282" REF="316">
After which <HI>Ari&s;taeus</HI> the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> and &s;ome
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> intending a Voyage to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
to procure Mony of the King towards carrying
on the War, went by the way to <HI>Sitalces</HI> King
of <HI>Thrace,</HI> &s;olliciting him to break with the <HI>A|thenians,</HI>

prevailing with the King to deliver them
up, they were &s;ent from thence to <HI>Athens,</HI> and
thrown into deep Pits without any Form of
Ju&s;tice. This was &s;aid to be done in Return
to the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who had given the like
Treatment to &s;ome <HI>Athenian</HI> Merchants taken
off of <HI>Peloponne&s;us:</HI> But the De&s;ign was laid
more particularly against <HI>Ari&s;taeus,</HI> who was
charg'd as the Author of all the Commotions in
<HI>Thrace.</HI> This Winter <HI>Po$idaea</HI> was &s;urrendered;
and tho' the Garri&s;on was reduc'd to that Ex|tremity
for want of Provi&s;ions, that they eat
one another, yet they obtain'd &s;uch tolerable
Terms, that the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who commanded
there, were que&s;tion'd for not making them
Pri&s;oners at Di&s;cretion. The <HI>Athenians</HI> planted
a Colony of their own in that City, after the
Siege of it had &s;tood them in two thou&s;and
Talents. This Action concluded the &s;econd
Year of the War.</P>
<P>II. The <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> open'd the third Cam|paign
with an Attempt upon <HI>Plataea;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Olym. 87. 4</HI></NOTE> who&s;e In|habitants

when he defeated the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> in their Territo|ry.
But they could obtain nothing more than
a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, 'till they could &s;end an
Account of their Affairs to <HI>Athens;</HI> from
<PB N="283" REF="317">
whence they receiv'd &s;uch firm A&s;&s;urances of
being reliev'd, that they &s;ent Word to <HI>Archi|damus,
They were ready to undergo the la&s;t Ex|tremity
of War, &s;ince to renounce their Confede|racy
with</HI> Athens, <HI>was what they never could
con&s;ent to.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plataea <HI>be|&s;ieg'd.</HI></NOTE> Upon which <HI>Archidamus</HI> inve&s;ted
the City, and rais'd an <HI>Agger</HI> or Mount, to
command the Walls. The <HI>Plataeans</HI> rais'd their
Wall in Proportion; and at the &s;ame Time by
an Hole at the Bottom, drew great Quantities
of Earth from the Mount: Which being di&s;co|ver'd,
they improv'd the Stratagem by carrying
a Mine to it from the Town; &s;o that &s;till as
the Wall was heighten'd, the Mount &s;unk;
and for their further Security, they run up ano|ther
Wall within. The <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> apply'd
their Engines of Battery to the Walls: But the
Defendants had &s;everal Contrivances by Beams
let down with Ropes, to evade the Force of
them. So that this Method al&s;o proving in|effectual,
they had Recour&s;e to Fire; and by
throwing in va&s;t Quantities of Fagots, with
Brim&s;tone, Pitch, and &s;uch like combu&s;tible
Matter, they burnt great Part of the Town.
But the Flame being at la&s;t extingui&s;h'd, they
were forc'd to make a formal Siege of it: In
order to which they inclos'de the City with a
Wall, which was fenced with a Ditch on each
Side. But it being late in the Year, they drew
off the Main of their Army, leaving only the
<HI>Boeotians</HI> with &s;ome others, to maintain their
Works, and keep the City block'd up. This
is the fir&s;t De&s;cription we meet with of any
Thing like a regular Siege among the <HI>Grecians;</HI>
tho&s;e which had hitherto been carry'd on, be|ing
very artle&s;s, and con&s;equently tedious,
<PB N="284" REF="318">
and expen&s;ive. Their common Method, when they
endeavour'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a
Town, was to attempt it by Storm, &s;urround|ing
it with their whole Army, and attack|ing
it in all Quarters at once; and if this prov'd
ineffectual, they either de&s;i&s;ted from the En|terprise,
or only renew'd the A&s;&s;ault after the
&s;ame rude Manner. Not but they had a Noti|on
in the <HI>Trojan,</HI> and <HI>Theban</HI> Wars of &s;ome|thing
like the <HI>Battering-Ram, Scaling-Ladders,</HI>
and other Engines; the Invention whereof they
very probably deriv'd with the re&s;t of their
Knowledge from the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries, where
they &s;eem to have been under&s;tood even in
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Time, and made U&s;e of by &s;everal of
the <HI>Jewi&s;H</HI> Kings. And if they did not receive
the &s;ame Improvement in <HI>Greece,</HI> proportion|ably
to their other Military Di&s;cipline, it may
be attributed chiefly to the Aver&s;ion the <HI>Lace|dAemonians</HI>
expre&s;s'd to this Way of Conquer|ing,
as not agreeable to their Notions of a gene|rous
Valour, which they made to con&s;i&s;t only
in pitch'd Battels. But when they found the
other <HI>Grecian</HI> Cities would not follow their
Example, of leaving them&s;elves open to all In|vaders
without the Defence of Walls, they
were better convinc'd of the Inconveniences,
into which $heir Ignorance in Sieges was likely
to betray them, and apply'd them&s;elves to this
nece&s;&s;ary part of the Service, in order to put
them upon a more equal Foot with their Neigh|bours.
So that from the time of this War we
may date the Art of Fortifying, and Attack|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="319">
During this Siege, the <HI>Athenians</HI> were en|gag'd
with the <HI>Chalcideans</HI> of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the
<HI>Bottiaeans</HI> of <HI>Macedon:</HI> But they being reliev'd
from <HI>Olynthus,</HI> and other Places, fought them,
and overcame them, compelling them to retire
with their broken Forces to <HI>Potidaea,</HI> and from
thence home to <HI>Athens.</HI> However this Di&s;|grace
was &s;oon reveng'd at Sea by <HI>Phormio</HI> the
<HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phormio</HI> Vvictorious at Sea.</NOTE> who lying before <HI>Naupactus,</HI>
tell in with forty &s;even <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> Sail, with
Land Forces on board them bound upon an Ex|pedition
again&s;t the <HI>Acarnanians,</HI> took twelve,
and di&s;pers'd the re&s;t. The <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> ha|ving
made great Preparations, ventur'd upon a|nother
Engagement; but by Confu&s;ion, and
Mi&s;management, the Advantage was again on
the <HI>Athenians</HI> Side. Before the Fleets were
laid up, <HI>Cnemus, Bra&s;idas,</HI> and the other <HI>Pelo|ponne&s;ian</HI>
Admirals re&s;olv'd to make an Attempt
upon the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> which was very &s;lightly guar|ded,
becau&s;e the <HI>Athenians</HI> being Lords of the
Sea, were under no Apprehen&s;ions on that Side.
In order to their De&s;ign, they went over Land
to <HI>Megara,</HI> and at <HI>Ni&s;aea</HI> the Port-Town
launch'd forty Ships: But their Hearts failing
them as to the Enterpri&s;e of the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and
the Wind withal being contrary, they conten|ted
them&s;elves with falling upon three Guard-Ships,
that lay at <HI>Budorus</HI> a Promontory of <HI>Sa|lamis:</HI>
Having taken them, they enter'd <HI>Sala|mis,</HI>
and plunder'd great Part of the I&s;land.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> di&s;cover'd the Beacons on Fire;
and this put them into a greater Con&s;ternation,
than any thing that had happen'd during the War:
But when the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> found they had ta|ken
the Alarm, they retreated.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="320">
In the Beginning of this Winter, <HI>Sitalces</HI>
King of <HI>Thrace</HI> made War again&s;t <HI>Perdiccas</HI>
King of <HI>Macedon.</HI> and wa&s;ted his Country
with an Army of an hundred and fifty thou|&s;and
Men. The <HI>Macedonians</HI> were forc'd to
&s;helter them&s;elves within their Towns; and
this numerous Army &s;truck &s;uch a Terror into
the other Neighbouring Nations, that the <HI>Gre|cians</HI>
them&s;elves were afraid, they had call'd in
&s;uch a Confederate, as was likely to become
their Ma&s;ter. <HI>Phormio</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> Admiral
having &s;ettled Affairs in <HI>Acarnania,</HI> return'd
Victorious with his Spoils to <HI>Athens;</HI> and thus
ended the third Year of the War with various
Succe&s;s on both Sides.</P>
<P>The Lo&s;s of <HI>Pericles</HI> was none of the lea&s;t
Di&s;graces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Death of</HI> Pericles.</NOTE> that fell on <HI>Athens</HI> during this Cam|paign.
He dy'd in the &s;ixth Month of the
Year of the Plague, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays; tho' it
was after a lingring Manner, more in the Na|ture
of a Con&s;umption. As he was drawing
on, his Friends, who &s;ate by him, and thought
him not &s;en&s;ible, were engag'd in a Di&s;cour&s;e
about his Virtue, and Authority, and the
Number of his Victories, he having erected no
le&s;s than nine Trophies as Commander in Chief.
He gave great Attention to what pa&s;s'd, and
made a &s;udden Reply, <HI>That he wonder'd, they
&s;hould value him &s;o much upon tho&s;e Things,
which Fortune had made common to him with
others, and pa&s;s by that which was of far greater
Moment, that none of his Fellow-Citizens had
ever put on Mourning upon his Account.</HI> And indeed it is very extraordinary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cha|racter.</NOTE> what is recor|ded
of him, that one who was engag'd in &s;uch
a long Variety of Affairs, and had Men of
<PB N="287" REF="321">
the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite Tempers to deal with, <HI>&s;hould
never employ his Power, or gratifie his Pa&s;&s;ion to
any Man's Hurt; or never treat an Enemy other|wi&s;e,
than as one who in time might become a
Friend.</HI> As to the Publick, it redounds parti|cularly
to his Glory, that when he had foil'd
his Rivals, and got the Power intirely into his
Hands, he &s;topt ju&s;t there, where oth$rs would
have been mo&s;t likely to proceed. But he was
certainly of a great and generous Spirit; he
acted upon a Principle of Honour, and Equity,
and &s;eem'd to value him&s;elf more upon leading
the People of <HI>Athens</HI> by the Force of his Merit,
and Eloquence, than by any thing of Arbitrary
Sway: So that that Power, which would other|wi&s;e
have been branded with the Name of Ty|ranny,
prov'd, as he manag'd it, the milde&s;t,
and yet the &s;tronge&s;t Support of the Govern|ment.
In his Military Conduct, however
warm he appear'd in advi&s;ing a War, yet when
it came to Action, he was very cautious, and
deliberate, not caring to engage, but where he
could almo&s;t warrant the Succe&s;s. And this
turn'd very much to his Reputation, being in|terpreted
as his Tenderne&s;s of expo&s;ing his Fel|low-Citizens;
to whom he would often &s;ay,
<HI>That he for his Part would do what he could, to
make them Immortal.</HI> At another time, when
he had much ado to re&s;train them from
Action, he told them, <HI>They mu&s;t not expect,
that Men, like Trees, when they were cut off,
would &s;hoot up again.</HI> In &s;hort, his Experi|ence
had taught him to depend more upon Con|duct,
and Stratagem, than an hardy Valour.
And tho' he had often been engag'd in War,
he made it chiefly &s;ub&s;ervient to his other De|&s;igns,
<PB N="288" REF="322">
chu&s;ing it, not &s;o much to make the
<HI>Athenians</HI> terrible abroad, as great at home.
His principal Care, and Study, was to &s;it and
direct at the Helm; wherein he &s;ucceeded &s;o
well, that he held the Admini&s;tration for forty
Years; and that in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing time
of the Common-wealth. This long uncontrou|lable
Sway of his, is to be attributed to nothing
more, than to his <HI>Art of Speaking;</HI> by which,
like a rapid Stream, he bore down every thing
that oppos'd him, and triumph'd over the Peo|ples
Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affections, which <HI>Plutarch</HI>
calls the <HI>Stops,</HI> and <HI>Keys</HI> of the Soul, and which
at that time in <HI>Athens,</HI> requir'd an extraordinary
skilful Hand to touch them. Not but the
Force of his Language was al&s;o &s;upported by
the Opinion the People had of his Integrity.
That he was above all Con&s;iderations of Mony,
appears in nothing more, than that he made no
Addition to his private E&s;tate: And tho' he
took upon him to di&s;po&s;e of prodigious Sums of
the publick Mony, he laid it out chiefly to the
Advantage, and Ornament of the State; and
whil&s;t he kept it circulating, did not drain the
Channel, tho' he diverted the Cour&s;e. We
may form a great <HI>Idea</HI> of him even from the
Cen&s;ure of tho&s;e, who &s;eem to bear harde&s;t
upon him; <HI>That the main of his Character a|greed
with that of</HI> Pi&s;i&s;tratus, <HI>only with this Dif|ference,
that he maintain'd his Tyranny with Arms,
but</HI> Pericles <HI>without them.</HI> The Lo&s;s of this great
Man appear'd every Day more con&s;iderable,
when his Succe&s;&s;ors, who were for the mo&s;t part
equal in Merit, and Rivals in Dignity, wanting
&s;ufficient Power to rein up the People, with
an ab&s;olute Hand, were oblig'd to manage them
<PB N="289" REF="323">
more remi&s;sly, to &s;ooth, and flatter them into
Obedience: And thus whil&s;t every one was
promoting his own Intere&s;t, the Care of the
Publick was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>About Harve&s;t time the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> inva|ded
<HI>Attica</HI> a third Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 88. 1</NOTE> but having done lit|tle

this would be to the Enemy, pretended
at fir&s;t not to believe it, in hopes by that
means to keep the Inhabitants from declaring
them&s;elves. But when they found the greate&s;t
Part of the I&s;land had thrown them&s;elves into
<HI>Mitylene</HI> their Capital, in order to make further
Preparations, they mann'd out forty Gallies to

where they were to be a&s;&s;embled without the
City; which the <HI>Lesbians</HI> having Notice of,
prepar'd to receive them; and whil&s;t they were
parlying with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>

their good Intentions to the common

otherwi&s;e, than in Oppo&s;ition to the</HI> Per&s;ian, <HI>and in
Defence of the common Liberty of</HI> Greece:
Which they in&s;inuated with &s;o much Artifice,
that they were now ea&s;ily admitted into the
Confederacy, tho' they had been deny'd it in
the Beginning of the War. Their Ports being
at this time block'd up by the <HI>Athenians,</HI> they
<PB N="290" REF="324">
had immediate Supplies decreed them: And a|nother
Expedition into <HI>Attica</HI> was re&s;olv'd on;
in order to which, the <HI>Spartans</HI> were ready at
the <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> But their Allies not coming up,
and thirty <HI>Athenian</HI> Ships at the &s;ame time ha|ra&s;&s;ing
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> they were
forc'd to return. The <HI>Mitylenians</HI> in the mean

and the <HI>Athenians</HI> to prevent the&s;e Excur&s;ions,

their Ca&s;e with a becoming Gravity, without
being arrogant, or dejected: But the <HI>Thebans</HI>
turn'd their Arguments &s;o forcibly upon that,
them the Judges only repeated the &s;ame Que|&s;tion
to them &s;everally. <HI>What Service they had
done 'em during the War?</HI> And upon their an|&s;wering,
<HI>None,</HI> order'd them to be executed to
the Number of two hundred <HI>Plataeans,</HI> and
twentyfive <HI>Athenians.</HI> What the <HI>Lacedaemo|nians</HI>
alledg'd to ju&s;tifie their Proceedings, was,
that they had propos'd to the <HI>Plataeans</HI> in the
Beginning of the War to &s;tand Neuter; and
that this Offer not being accepted, left them
at Liberty to treat them with the utmo&s;t Se|verity.
But they &s;eem rather to have grati|fy'd
the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who had a more particular
Pique to them: And upon this Account
the <HI>Plataeans</HI> in their Defence, reproach'd the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> with &s;acrificing their Ju&s;tice, to
keep up the Con$ederacy. <HI>If you mea&s;ure Ju|&s;tice
by your Intere&s;ts,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>you will give
us Rea&s;on to believe your Intere&s;ts are dearer to

appear, that the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> &s;till kept up to
that rigorous Principle of Honour, and Equity,
upon which &s;o great a Share of their Merit was
founded; but that during the whole Cour&s;e of

for which he was complimented by &s;eve|ral
Cities, which came in to him as the <HI>Delive|rer

therefore as one, who &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to bring
the War to an happy I&s;&s;ue, he was honourably
interr'd, and had Anniver&s;ary Games perform'd
in Memory of him. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> were
glad to treat at this time, while they could do
it with Honour. Be&s;ides they had nothing
more at Heart, than the Impri&s;onment of their
Men taken at <HI>Pylus,</HI> they being the chief of their
City: And among other Considerations, it
was not the lea&s;t, that the Truce, which they
had made with <HI>Argos</HI> for thirty Years, was ju&s;t

the chief In&s;trument in it. Be&s;ides the tender
Concern he always expre&s;s'd for his Country,
he had more particular Ends in it, in &s;curing
his Reputation. For no General had been up|on
more Expeditions than he, or succeeded
better; but yet he was &s;en&s;ible, he ow'd more
to his good <HI>Genius,</HI> and cautious Management,

interrupted, becau&s;e the Treaty was never fairly
put in Execution.</P>
<P>This &s;tuck chiefly upon the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI>
to whom it falling by Lot to make the fir&s;t Re|&s;titution,
<PB N="309" REF="343">
they immediately began with that of
Per&s;ons, and in Return, receiv'd their Pri&s;on|ers
taken at <HI>Pylus:</HI> And for Places, they en|deavour'd
it; but the Truth is, they had pro|mis'd
more than they were able to perform.
They had won more Towns than the <HI>Athe|nians;</HI>
but then they were not &s;uch ab&s;olute
Ma&s;ters of them. For &s;ome they had re&s;tor'd
to &s;uch of their Allies, $rom whom the <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
had taken them; &s;ome, and tho&s;e the great|e&s;t
Part, they had &s;et at Liberty upon open|ing
their Gates to them, as their Friends, and
Deliverers: And tho' they found Means of
making Satisfaction for the&s;e, by permitting the
<HI>Athenians</HI> to retain others, which they had ta|ken
during the War; yet there were others,
which they had taken into their Protection,
and which having exa&s;perated the <HI>Athenians</HI> by
revolting, would not endure to hear of being
abandon'd to their old Ma&s;ters. Of this latter
&s;ort was <HI>Amphipolis,</HI> which would not be a&s;|&s;ign'd
over, tho' the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had drawn
out their Garri&s;on, and us'd all the Methods

they had promis'd to employ in ca&s;e of a po&s;i|tive
Refu&s;al; and by joining with the <HI>Athenians</HI>
to oblige all the Confederates in general to ac|cept
of the Peace.</P>
<P>But this cold Performance of Articles made
the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of their In|tentions,
and keep what they had in their
Hands: And tho' they maintain'd a sort of
Corre&s;pondence, they were &s;o $ar from proceed|ing
with Vigour again&s;t the di&s;contented Con|federates,
that they gave them an Opportunity
of Uniting again&s;t them. The fir&s;t who pub|li&s;h'd
<PB N="310" REF="344">
their Grievances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re&s;t of the Confe|derates di&s;|gu&s;ted.</NOTE> were the <HI>Corinthians;</HI>
who turning all their Anger upon the <HI>Lacedae|monians,</HI>
as being de&s;erted by them, apply'd
them&s;elves to <HI>Argos</HI> their profe&s;s'd Enemy,
in&s;inuating, <HI>That their League with</HI> Athens,
<HI>was only a Combination betwixt 'em to en&s;lave
the re&s;t of</HI> Greece. There needed not many
Arguments with the <HI>Argives,</HI> who&s;e Truce be|ing
expir'd, they expected when the <HI>Lacedae|monians</HI>
&s;hould fall upon them. Be&s;ides they
were grown rich, and powerful through a long
Cour&s;e of Tranquility, and had conceiv'd &s;uch
a contemptible Notion of the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI>
&s;ince their Defeat at <HI>Pylus,</HI> and their &s;uing for
Peace, that they thought this a good Oppor|tunity
of wre&s;ting the Sovereignty of <HI>Pelopon|ne&s;us</HI>
out of their Hands. Accordingly they
deputed twelve of their Citizens with a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
at large, to make an Alliance with any
free Cities of <HI>Greece,</HI> but <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta.</HI>
The Gates of <HI>Argos</HI> being open to all the re&s;t,
the fir&s;t that led the Way, was <HI>Mantinea</HI> of
<HI>Arcadia,</HI> which had lately thrown off its
Dependance upon <HI>Sparta;</HI> and this City was
followed by &s;everal others of <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> The
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> perceiving the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to be
at the bottom of all the&s;e Proceedings, &s;ent
their Amba&s;&s;adors to put a Stop to them. Who
after many Remon&s;trances, charg'd them with
Perjury, in ca&s;e they for&s;ook the Alliance, or
did not accept the Treaty upon the Foot it
was &s;ettled, &s;ince it was agreed between 'em,
<HI>That what was concluded by a Majority, &s;hould
be binding to all.</HI> The <HI>Corinthians</HI> turn'd their
own Arguments of Rea&s;on and Religion upon
them, alledging, <HI>That they had not perform'd
<PB N="311" REF="345">
the Conditions of the Treaty, in not providing bet|ter
for the Re&s;titution of the Places, they had
lo&s;t: That they could not de&s;ort their Confede|rates
in</HI> Thrace, <HI>without manife&s;t Breach of a
former Oath, which they had taken to protect
them; and that as for their League with</HI> Argos,
<HI>they &s;hould follow Ju&s;tice, and the Advice of
their Friends.</HI> Thus having di&s;mi&s;s'd the Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
they not only enter'd them&s;elves in|to
Alliance with <HI>Argos,</HI> but endeavour'd to
bring in &s;everal other States, and practis'd more
particularly with the <HI>Thebans,</HI>$ and <HI>Megareans;</HI>
But the different Forms of Government us'd
in <HI>Thebes,</HI> and <HI>Argos,</HI> made them incline rather
to <HI>Sparta.</HI> Thus was mo&s;t part of this Year
&s;pent in Conferences, and Negotiations on all
Sides, in breaking and renewing Treaties
and Alliances, without concluding any thing
effectually. In the mean while <HI>Athens</HI> and
<HI>Sparta</HI> were in a manner left to them&s;elves, be|ing
equally jealous of their Neighbours, and
di&s;&s;atisfy'd with each other. The <HI>Athenians</HI>
finding the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> more particularly
unea$fi$ about <HI>Pylus,</HI> which was &s;till in their
Hands, intimated to them, that they &s;hould
be repo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, provided the <HI>Boeotians</HI> would
re&s;tore <HI>Panactum</HI> to them. Yet the <HI>Boeotians</HI>
refus'd to part with it, unle&s;s the <HI>Lacedaemo|nians</HI>
would make a private League with them:
Which they did, tho' they knew it was ex|pre&s;ly
contrary to that, which they had rati|fy'd
with the <HI>Athenians;</HI> wherein it was provi|ded,
<HI>That no Treaty &s;hould be made without
the joint Con&s;ent of them both.</HI> But the <HI>Boeo|tians,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding their Agreement, demo|li&s;h'd
<HI>Panactum,</HI> alledging for their Excu&s;e,
that as it &s;tood upon the Confines of <HI>Attica</HI>
<PB N="312" REF="346">
and <HI>Boeotia,</HI> it was formerly agreed, that it
&s;hould not be held by either in particular, but
in common to both.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> having broke one Arti|cle
of their Treaty with the <HI>Athenians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 1</NOTE> to en|able
them to perform another, were &s;hame|fully
di&s;appointed of their hopes in the <HI>The|bans</HI>
about the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Panactum:</HI> And all
they had to &s;alve the Matter at <HI>Athens,</HI> was,
<HI>That the Place was not now in a Condition of har|bouring
any Enemies to the State.</HI> But the <HI>A|thenians</HI>
re&s;ented it extreamly, as not imagining
but what was done, was at lea&s;t with their
Con&s;ent, if not at their In&s;tigation. They
told 'em plainly, <HI>They had broke the three mo&s;t
material Articles of the Peace, in entering into a
&s;eparate League with the</HI> Boeotians; <HI>in demoli&s;h|ing
a, Town they ought to have re&s;tor'd; and
la&s;tly, in not forcing their Dependants to make
good the re&s;t of the Treaty.</HI></P>
<P>When things were thus far advanc'd to|wards
Alcibiades, a Rupture, they were ea&s;ily aggravated
both by the pre&s;ent <HI>Ephori</HI> at <HI>Sparta,</HI> who were
more inclinable to the War, as al&s;o by &s;everal
of the leading Men at <HI>Athens. Nicias</HI> indeed
was employ'd as a Mediator on both Sides;
but was violently oppos'd by <HI>Alcibiades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Ri&s;e and Cha|recter of</HI> $word$</NOTE> who
had too con&s;iderable a Share in tho&s;e Tran&s;acti|ons,

was <HI>Clinias,</HI> who fitted out a Gally at his own
Charge, and behav'd very well in the Fight at
<HI>Artemi&s;ium.</HI> He was left young to the Care of
his Uncle <HI>Pericles;</HI> under whom he laid the
Foundation of that Eminence, to which he af|terwards
arriv'd. He was naturally &s;ubject: to
great Exce&s;&s;cs of Pa&s;&s;ion in all kinds; but the
<PB N="313" REF="347">
mo&s;t prevailing was his Ambition: In the Pur|&s;uit
of which he appear'd bold and generous,
and yet &s;omewhat turbulent, and perver&s;e. Of
which we may form an Idea, from an In&s;tance
of his Childhood: For as he was playing in
the Street, a Cart happen'd to come by; and
being very intent upon his Sport, he bid the
Driver &s;top: When he &s;ound he could not have
his Will of the Fellow, but that he &s;till came
on, he throws him&s;elf along ju&s;t in the Road,
<HI>Now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>drive on.</HI> His way of living
was not only loo&s;e and effeminate, but riotous
even to Debauchery, and a Contempt of Re|ligion,
and the Laws. Not but he could put
a Re&s;traint upon him&s;elf when his Intere&s;t re|quir'd
it; and was &s;uch a Ma&s;ter of Di&s;gui&s;e,
that he could conform him&s;elf to any Fa&s;hion,
or Country. In <HI>Ionia,</HI> he was luxurious, fro|lick,
and lazy; in <HI>Thrace,</HI> he was always drink|ing,
or on Hor&s;e-back; and when he was with
<HI>Per&s;ias,</HI> he exceeded them in Pomp, and Mag|nificence.
He could comply with the fevere&s;t
Di&s;cipline, and the &s;tricte&s;t Virtue; in&s;omuch
that even at <HI>Sparta</HI> he was admir'd, as one la|borious,
frugal, and re&s;erv'd; and it is remark|able,
that of all his Friends, none was more inti|mate
with him than <HI>Socrates.</HI> So that it is not &s;o
much from the Inequality of his Manners, as
from the different Appearances of them, that
Men have form'd &s;o many different Judgments
of him. But whatever his Vices were, he was
a Man of prodigious Parts, Subtilty, and Ad|dre&s;s,
and had &s;o many Ways of recommend|ing
him&s;elf, that he appear'd to a greater Ad|vantage,
than &s;everal others, who acted upon
more &s;olid and &s;teady Principles. His Noble

Birth, and the Glory of his Ance&s;tors; his
Riches, which he employ'd in Donatives, pub|lick

Courage, and Application to Military Af|fairs,

the &s;ofte&s;t Names to his Exce&s;&s;es: So that
what would have been criminal in others, pa&s;s'd
in him only for the Starts, and Sallies of Youth,
and the Effects of good Nature. In &s;hort, he
had a Charm for every one he convers'd with;
and tho&s;e who abhorr'd his <HI>Practices,</HI> at the
&s;ame time doted on the <HI>Man.</HI> His fir&s;t Expe|dition
was again&s;t <HI>Potidaea;</HI> where being woun|ded,
and hard pre&s;s'd by the Enemy, <HI>Socrates</HI>
threw him&s;elf before him, and re&s;cu'd him:
And he afterwards did athe &s;ame for <HI>Socrates</HI> at
the Battel of <HI>Delium.</HI> Having got &s;ome Re|putation
in the Army, he was immediately fur|rounded
with a Croud of Flatterers; and as
his Vanity all along kept Pace with his Am|bition,
he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, that as &s;oon as
he concern'd him&s;elf in publick Affairs, he
&s;hould not only eclip&s;e the re&s;t of the Gene|rals,
and State&s;men, but exceed the Authority,
and Reputation of <HI>Pericles</HI> him&s;elf. And in|deed
he &s;oon order'd it &s;o, that he had none
but <HI>Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Phoeax</HI> to grapple with; the
former of which being the older Man, and of
a more &s;ettled Intere&s;r, and Character, e&s;peci|ally
with tho&s;e who were weary of the War,
<PB N="315" REF="349">
he thought, if he could any ways undermine
him, he &s;hould have little more to do.</P>
<P>With this De&s;ign he had all along oppos'd
the Peace: And ob&s;erving now, that the <HI>Ar|gives</HI>
&s;ought for Protection again&s;t the <HI>Lacedae|monians,</HI>
he gave them a &s;ecret A&s;&s;urance of a
League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with <HI>Athens:</HI>
And tran&s;acting as well in Per&s;on, as by Let|ters
with tho&s;e, who had mo&s;t Authority a|mong&s;t
the People, he encourag'd them <HI>to be
under no manner of Apprehen&s;ions from</HI> Spar|ta,
<HI>but to apply them&s;elves wholly to the</HI> A|thenians,
<HI>who, if they would expect but a lit|tle
while, would repent of the Peace, and &s;oon
put an End to it.</HI> Accordingly he laid hold
of this Juncture, and improv'd the Handle the
<HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had given, to exa&s;perate the Peo|ple
both again&s;t them, and <HI>Nicias.</HI> Which
had &s;o good an Effect:, that every thing &s;eemed
di&s;pos'd for a Treaty with <HI>Argos:</HI> Of which
the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> being very apprehen&s;ive, im|mediately
di&s;patch'd their Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>A|thens;</HI>
who at fir&s;t &s;aid what &s;eem'd very &s;ati&s;|factory,
<HI>That they came with full Power to con|cert

The Council receiv'd their Propo&s;rtions, and
the People was to a&s;&s;emble the next Day, to
give them Audience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Stra|tagem to oppo&s;e the Peace.</NOTE> <HI>Alcibiades</HI> in the mean

Terms, as they could not with Honour
con&s;ent to. They were &s;o well &s;atisfy'd of
the Prudence, and Sincerity of this Advice,
that he drew them from <HI>Nicias,</HI> to rely intire|ly
upon him&s;elf: And the next Day, when the
People were a&s;&s;embled, and the Amba&s;&s;adors
introduc'd, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> with a very obliging Air
demanded of them, <HI>With what Powers they

&s;o little Dependence.</HI> The People di&s;mi&s;s'd the
Amba&s;&s;adors in a Rage; and <HI>Nicias</HI> knowing
nothing of the Deceit, was confounded, and in
Di&s;grace. To redeem his Credit, he propos'd
being &s;ent once more to <HI>Sparta:</HI> But not being

that the whole Intent of it was levell'd again&s;t

<P>II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 2 Alcibiades <HI>declar'd General.</HI></NOTE> Upon this new Alliance, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was
declar'd General; and tho' his be&s;t Friends
could not commend the Method, by which he
effected all this; yet it was look'd upon as a
great Reach in the Politicks, thus to divide,
and &s;hake almo&s;t all <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and to remove
the War &s;o far from the <HI>Athenian</HI> Frontier, that
<PB N="317" REF="351">
even Succe&s;s would profit the Enemy but lit|tle,
&s;hould they be Conquerors, whereas if
they were defeated, <HI>Sparta</HI> it &s;elf was hardly
&s;afe. The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Year, was a
War between the <HI>Argives</HI> and <HI>Epidaurians,</HI> be|gun
upon a &s;light Pretence, that the Latter had
refus'd to &s;end a Victim to <HI>Apollo Pythius,</HI>
who&s;e Temple belong'd chiefly to the Care of
the <HI>Argives:</HI> But the true De&s;ign was to &s;e|cure
them&s;elves on that Side from the <HI>Corin|thians.</HI>
Accordingly they made &s;everal Incur|&s;ions
into their Territories, but without any
con&s;iderable Action: And <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> who
march'd to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, having done little
more than &s;hewn him&s;elf in <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> re|turn'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> had of late made very
&s;aint Efforts to recover their Authority:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 3</NOTE> But
finding many of their Confederates already
gone off, and the re&s;t wavering, re&s;olv'd to re|medy
the Evil, before it &s;pread too far; and
drawing out their whole Force both of Citi|zens
and Slaves, were join'd by their Allies,
and encamp'd almo&s;t under the Walls of <HI>Ar|gos.</HI>
The <HI>Argives</HI> having Notice of their
March, made all po&s;&s;ible Preparations, and came
out with a full Re&s;olution to fight them. But
ju&s;t as they were going to engage, two of
their Officers went over to <HI>Agis</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI>
King and General, and propos'd to him to have
the Bu&s;ine&s;s made up by a Reference. He im|mediately
clo&s;ing with the Offer, in Order to
it granted them a Truce for four Months, and
drew off his Army, the whole Affair being in
a manner tran&s;acted by the&s;e three, without
any general Con&s;ent, or Knowledge on either
<PB N="318" REF="352">
Side. The <HI>Peloponne&s;ians,</HI> tho' they dur&s;t not
di&s;obey their Orders, inveigh'd grievou&s;ly a|gain&s;t
<HI>Agis,</HI> for letting &s;uch an Advantage &s;lip,
as they could never promi&s;e to them&s;elves a|gain:
For they had actually hemm'd in the Enemy,
and that with the be&s;t, if not the great|e&s;t
Army, that ever was brought into the Field. And the
<HI>Argives</HI> were &s;o little appre|hen&s;ive
of Danger on their Side, that they were
no le&s;s incens'd again&s;t their Mediators;
one of whom they forc'd to the Altars to &s;ave
his Life, and confi&s;cated his Goods.</P>
<P>Afterwards the <HI>Athenians</HI> came with con|siderable
Recruits, and per&s;uaded the <HI>Argives</HI>
to break the Truce, telling them, <HI>It was not
good, becau&s;e made without the Privity of their
Confederates.</HI> Upon that they be&s;ieg'd <HI>Orcho|mentts</HI>
in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and took it: At which the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
were &s;o enrag'd, that imputing
it all to <HI>Agis,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to pull down his
Hou&s;e, and Fine him; but upon his Promi&s;e to
do &s;omething, that &s;hould &s;ufficiently clear his
Conduct, they forbore; yet would not &s;uf|fer
him to take the Field again, without a&s;&s;igning
him ten of their Citizens, as Council. An
Occa&s;ion was &s;oon offer'd to wipe off this Stain,
by marching to the Relief of <HI>Tegea.</HI> In the
Territory of <HI>Mantinea</HI> he gave the <HI>Argives</HI>
Battel:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Battel at</HI> Manti|nea, <HI>be|tween the</HI> Lacedae|monians, <HI>and</HI> Ar|gives.</NOTE> And tho' his right Wing was pre&s;s'd,
the main Battel, where he him&s;elf commanded
forc'd the Enemy to give Ground; and having
by that means got an Opportunity of relieving
the re&s;t, he obtain'd a memorable Victory;
which yet might have been more compleat,
if he would have made the mo&s;t of it: But it
being again&s;t the <HI>Spartan</HI> Di&s;cipline to continue
<PB N="319" REF="353">
the Pur&s;uit long, he contented him&s;elf with
being Ma&s;ter of the Field. However there
fell eleven hundred of the Enemy, and
only three hundred <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> with
&s;ome few of their Confederates. <HI>Agis</HI> by this
Battel redeem'd both his own, and his Coun|try's
Honour, &s;o far at lea&s;t, that tho&s;e Mis|carriages,
which had pa&s;s'd for Cowardi&s;e, or
Mi&s;management, were now generally a&s;crib'd
to Fortune. Upon this, the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI>
took the Field again this Year; but rather than
venture another Battel, cho&s;e to treat with <HI>Ar|gos;</HI>
which pre&s;ently concluded with them
fir&s;t a Peace, and then a League, thereby ex|cluding
all its Allies but <HI>Mantinea,</HI> which by
rea&s;on of its Situation between them both, was
oblig'd to declare for <HI>Sparta.</HI> That which fa|cilitated
the Treaty, was a De&s;ign of &s;ome of
the <HI>Argives,</HI> to introduce an <HI>Oligarchy;</HI> which
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> they
e&s;tabli&s;h'd after their Model; and the &s;ame
Change was effected at <HI>Sicyon.</HI></P>
<P>But in a few Months after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 90. 4</NOTE> the Commons
at <HI>Argos</HI> took up Arms, and having gain'd &s;ome
Advantage, <HI>Alcibiades</HI> came in to their Aid,
and not only re&s;tor'd the <HI>Democracy,</HI> but made
them renew their League with <HI>Athens.</HI> He per|&s;uaded
them further to join their City to the
Sea by long Walls, that &s;o he might upon all
Occa&s;ions relieve them; which were no &s;ooner
perfected, but the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> came with an
Army, and demoli&s;h'd them.</P>
<P>This Summer <HI>Alcibiades</HI> to keep <HI>Argos</HI> firm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym 91. $</NOTE>
went thither with twenty Gallics; and appre|hending
about three hundred of tho&s;e, who
were mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected to be in the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="354">
Intere&s;t, di&s;pers'd them in the neighbouring
I&s;lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs at</HI> Melos.</NOTE> A&s;ter which the <HI>Athenians</HI> re&s;olving,
that <HI>Melos</HI> &s;hould acknowledge their Sove|reignty,
as the re&s;t of the I&s;lands did, went
with a Fleet again&s;t it; and at their Arrival
&s;ent their Deputies to expo&s;tulate. The <HI>Me|lians</HI>
told them in a long Conference, <HI>That
whil&s;t they had any Hopes left, it could not be
expected, they should throw up that Liberty,
which' they had maintain'd &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully for &s;e|ven
hundred Years: That the two disputable
Points in War, were Fortune, and Power; for
the fir&s;t of which, they could depend upon the
Ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e, to keep the Gods on their
Side; and as for human A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that as they
were a Colony and Confederate of the</HI> Lacedae|monians,
<HI>they had good Rea&s;on to expect it of
them from a double Tye of Honour, and Con&s;an|guinity:
That however, if not to mole&s;t the</HI> A|thenians,
<HI>would an&s;wer their Purpo&s;e, they were
content to &s;tand Neuter.</HI> This they in&s;inuated
in &s;o artful, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive a Manner; and yet
with &s;omething &s;o noble and ingenuous, that
they kept up to the Character of Men, who
were willing to pre&s;erve their Lives, provided
it were not at the Expence of their Honour,
and Liberty, and who knew how to employ
their Rea&s;on well, when their Sword had fail'd
them. The An&s;wer of the <HI>Athenians</HI> was full
of In&s;olence, and Contempt, <HI>That they did not
come to enter into a long Detail, or to Debate, &s;o
as to put them&s;elves upon an equal Foot with
them: That they could lo&s;e no Honour by &s;ub|mitting
to &s;uch a Power as theirs: That they
&s;aw the Danger was at Hand; and the only
Que&s;tion was, Whether, they would be pre&s;erv'd
<PB N="321" REF="355">
or not.</HI> However to give &s;ome Colour to their
Proceedings, they intimated a Right of Sove|reignty
over them, which they deriv'd from the
time of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Wars. Then they ridicul'd
the Vanity of their Hopes in depending upon
the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> telling them, <HI>That what|ever
Genero&s;ity their Cou&s;titution oblig'd them to
expre&s;s, it was generally confin'd to them&s;elves;
for that in re&s;pect of others, Honour and Ju&s;tice
were but other Names for Will, and Interet&s;t;
and that this was no where more a Maxim,
than at</HI> Sparta: <HI>That &s;uppo&s;ing them never &s;o
well inclin'd to relieve them, yet it was not in
their Power, whil&s;t the</HI> Athenians <HI>were Ma&s;ters
at Sea: And that in &s;hort, &s;ince they would not
embrace this only Opportunity of preventing their
Ruin, they mu&s;t expect the Con&s;equence.</HI> After
this fruitle&s;s Intercour&s;e, the <HI>Athenians</HI> began
their Works, and were interrupted by two &s;uc|ce&s;sful
Sallies of the <HI>Melians.</HI> But in the Win|ter,
upon the Arrival of Recruits from <HI>Athens,</HI>
they &s;urrender'd at Di&s;cretion; the Men were
put to the Sword, the Women and Children
made Slaves, and the Place repcopled by a Co|lony
of five hundred <HI>Athenians. Peloponne&s;us</HI>
was generally quiet this Year: But the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
who lay in <HI>Pylus,</HI> infe&s;ted <HI>Laconia,</HI> and
carry'd in a great deal of Booty; with the <HI>I a|cedaemonians</HI>
did not care to re&s;ent as a manife&s;t
Breach of the Peace, but only gave Leave in
general to any of their People, to make Repri|&s;als
in <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this little Re&s;pite from open War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 91. 2 <HI>Affairs $word$</HI> Sicily.</NOTE> the <HI>Athenians</HI>
turn'd their Thoughts again upon <HI>Si|cily,</HI>
having the la&s;t Year entertain'd Amba&s;&s;a|dors
from <HI>Ege&s;ta,</HI> who demanded their A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="322" REF="356">
again&s;t the <HI>Selinuntians,</HI> and <HI>Syracu&s;ians.</HI>
They promis'd large Supplies of Mony for car|rying
on the War; and repre&s;ented, that <HI>A|thens</HI>
was particularly intere&s;ted in the Quarrel,
lea&s;t <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> growing ab&s;olute at home, &s;hould
join with the <HI>Peloponne&s;ians</HI> again&s;t it. The <HI>A|thenians</HI>
readily embrac'd &s;o plau&s;ible an handle,
as the aiding their Con$ederates: But <HI>Alcibi|ades</HI>
was the Man, who inflam'd this De&s;ire of
theirs to the heighth, and prevail'd with them no
longer to proceed &s;ecretly in their De&s;ign, and
by Degrees, but to &s;et out a great Fleet, and
undertake at once to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters
of the I&s;land. To this purpo&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the
People with great hopes, whil&s;t he him&s;elf en|tertain'd
much greater; &s;o that the Conque&s;t of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> which was the utmo&s;t Bound of their
Ambition, was but the Beginning of his. For
he dreamt of nothing le&s;s than the Conque&s;t of
<HI>Carthage,</HI> and <HI>Lybia;</HI> and by the Acce&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e, fancy'd him&s;elf already Matter of <HI>Italy,</HI>
and <HI>Peloponne&s;us;</HI> and &s;eem'd to look upon
<HI>Sicily,</HI> as little more than a Magazine for the
War. The wifer Sort made a Je&s;t of this Ex|pedition,
but dur&s;t not declare their Opinion
freely, becau&s;e they &s;ound the bulk of the Peo|ple
&s;o taken up with the Thoughts of it, that
you might &s;ee them, Old and Young, forming
them&s;elves into Companies, &s;ome drawing the
Figure of <HI>Sicily,</HI> others making Charts and de|&s;cribing
the Seas, Harbours, and Places which
this I&s;le &s;hews oppo&s;ite to the <HI>African</HI> Shore.</P>
<P>Accordingly they decreed a War under the
Conduct of <HI>Alcibiades, Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Lamachus,</HI>
thinking to temper rhe Heat of the fir&s;t, with
the Caution, and Experience of the others.
<PB N="323" REF="357">
But <HI>Nicias</HI> would have declin'd the Command,
by oppo&s;ing the thing in general, as no le&s;s
difficult in it &s;elf, than ill-tim'd in re&s;pect of
the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> who only wanted &s;uch an
Opportunity, to repair their Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;|grace.
He al&s;o inveigh'd again&s;t <HI>Alcibiades,</HI>
as too young and ra&s;h for &s;uch an Enterpri&s;e,
and in&s;inuated, <HI>That his chief Aim in promo|ting
it, was to &s;upport his own Grandeur and
Luxury, at the Expence and Danger of the Pub|lick.
Alcibiades</HI> urg'd on the contrary, <HI>That
they had nothing to fear from the</HI> Lacedaemoni|ans,
<HI>who were brought &s;o low, that he had lately
oblig'd them to &s;take their</HI> All <HI>upon the Fortune
of one Day at</HI> Mantinea. <HI>Then for active, and
turbulent Spirits, &s;uch as were the</HI> Athenians,
<HI>that it was always thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep them
up to their Di&s;cipline, and that they could be no
where more profitably employ'd, than again&s;t &s;uch
States, as they had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect would be
their Enemies, and whom in common Policy they
ought to begin with fir&s;t. That therefore the Ob|&s;tinacy
of</HI> Nicias <HI>in oppo&s;ing it, tended only to
Sloth, and Sedition. Nicias</HI> had no Way left to
deter the People from this Enterpri&s;e, but by
laying before them the great Preparations it
would require: But to obviate all Objections
of this kind, they declar'd the three Generals
ab&s;olute, to regulate every thing both at
home and abroad, in the manner they &s;hould
judge mo&s;t conducive to the Advantage of the
State.</P>
<P>There being no further room for a Debate,
a great Fleet was rigg'd out of above an hun|dred
and thirty Sail, with five thou&s;and
and one hundred Soldiers, and other nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions

But ju&s;t as they were putting to Sea, it hap|pen'd

broken: Which being look'd upon as ominous
to the Expedition, and &s;uppos'd to be done by
&s;ome who were ill-affected to the <HI>Democracy,</HI>
great Rewards were propos'd to any that would

<HI>Alcibiades</HI> was accus'd. The People were

<P>The whole Fleet met at <HI>Corcyra,</HI> and from

for making directly to <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> the Capital:
He urg'd, <HI>That it was as yet unprovided, and

him, <HI>If he dur&s;t not tru&s;t his native Country?

about two hundred and &s;ixty of them and their

the Year in Irruptions into each others Terri|tories;

it was not properly an Intermi&s;&s;ion of the War,

The <HI>Athenians</HI> had given the mo&s;t

about a hundred and twenty Furlongs from <HI>A|thens.</HI>
At the &s;ame time the Affairs of the
<HI>Athenians</HI> had a very indifferent A&s;pect before
<HI>Syracu&s;e:</HI> Where after an Engagement with the
Enemy in their great Haven with various Suc|ce&s;s,
<HI>Gylippus</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> &s;urpriz'd <HI>Plemmyri|um,</HI>
which commanded rhe Port. Herein the
<HI>Athenians</HI> lo&s;t a great Sum of Mony, and their
Naval Stores, and could not be &s;upply'd with
more, but by forcing their Way through the
Enemy, who at Anchor under the Fort.

three Sail, and five thou&s;and Soldiers, who
with the glittering of their Armour, the Flags
and Streamers waving in the Air from the Gal|lies,
and variety of Mu&s;ick, appear'd with all
the Pomp and Terror of a victorious Navy.
They re&s;olv'd immediately upon their Arrival
to atrack <HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI> and in the Night &s;et upon
a part of the City, call'd <HI>Epipolae,</HI> but after a
confus'd and dubious Skirmi&s;h, were repuls'd.
<HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> who had advis'd $h$, Fight, was
now for quitting the I&s;land; and <HI>Nicias,</HI> who
had been mo&s;t aver&s;e to it, was for carrying
on the Sieg, for fear of being call'd to ac|count,
as his Predece&s;&s;ors were for con&s;enting
to a Peace in the former Inva&s;ion of <HI>Sicily.</HI>
Be&s;ides he thought his Army in a better Con|dition
than the <HI>Syracu&s;ian,</HI> which was almo&s;t
exhau&s;ted by the War, and depended chiefly
<PB N="328" REF="362">
on Mercenaries, who would de&s;ert when Pay
&s;ail'd. Another Motive was, that he had hopes
from a Party within the Town, of having it be|tray'd
to him. But upon the News of <HI>Gylip|pus</HI>'s
coming with Recruits from mo&s;t Parts of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> he was prevail'd upon to decamp; And
ju&s;t as he was ordering his Retreat with all
Expedition and Secrecy, there happen'd an E|clip&s;e
of the Moon; which was look'd upon
as very ominous, and &s;o s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd
by him, and the other Generals, that they re|s;olv'd
to &s;tay twenty &s;even Days longer, which
was the time appointed by the Sooth&s;ayers. In
the mean while <HI>Nicias</HI> being intent upon his
Sacrifices, the <HI>Syracu&s;ians</HI> advanc'd with their
Infantry, and Gallies, and the very Boys row'd
about in Cock-boats, in&s;ulting them, and pro|voking

&s;harp Engagement en&s;u'd in the great Haven,
wherein <HI>Eurymedon,</HI> and many others were &s;lain.
After which the <HI>Syracn&s;ians,</HI> to make it a com|pleat
Victory, drew up a Line of Gallies, and
with them block'd up the Mouth of the Port,
which was eight Furlongs over. The <HI>Athe|nians</HI>
finding no way left, but to break through
the <HI>Syracu&s;ian</HI> Fleet, re&s;olv'd to try their For|tune
once more;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another.</HI></NOTE> and another Fight $n&s;u'd with
the greate&s;t Number of Ships, and the mo&s;t
Skill and Di&s;cipline on both Sides, but with
the greate&s;t. Heat and Ob&s;tinacy, of any that had
yet happened. The Victory at la&s;t inclin'd to
the <HI>Syracu&s;ians;</HI> and tho' in this Action they
had lo&s;t almo&s;t an equal number of Ve&s;&s;els,
yet the <HI>Athenians</HI> were &s;o di&s;abled, and their
Seamen &s;o dejected, that they could not be
per&s;uaded to go on board again, tho' they
<PB N="329" REF="363">
had &s;till more Ships fit for Service, than the
Enemy.</P>
<P>In this Extremity they could propo&s;e nothing
but to march away by Land, and accordingly
prepar'd to di&s;lodge the &s;ame Night. <HI>Hermo|crates</HI>
the <HI>Sicilian</HI> General &s;u&s;pecting their De|&s;ign,

Credit with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and they &s;taid
three Days longer, in which time <HI>Gylippus</HI> had
actually prepar'd to hinder their Retreat. They
le&s;t their Ships to the Enemy, and broke up
in the Night with all the Horror and Con$u|&s;ion
imaginable; and being divided into two
Bodies, <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> was pre&s;s'd in the Rear,
and after a &s;hort Di&s;pute &s;urrender'd with his

<HI>Hermocrates</HI> al&s;o &s;eem'd to be of his Opinion,

to kill him. <HI>Thucydides</HI> &s;ays in general of him,

<HI>That he lea&s;t de&s;erv'd this &s;evere Treatment of

The whole Number of tho&s;e, who decamp'd
from <HI>&s;tracutse,</HI> amounted to no le&s;s than forty

<P>Such was the Event of the Siege of <HI>Syracu&s;e;</HI>

un&s;ea&s;onably undertaken to &s;ubdue. And the
Lo&s;s was &s;till much greater in regard to the In|fluence
it afterwards had on their Affairs at
home. This put an End to he <HI>Sicilian</HI> War,
which is to be con&s;ider'd chiefly with refe|rence
to the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian:</HI> And as it was car|ry'd
on by mo&s;t of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Confederates, it
was properly a Continuation of it, tho' the
<HI>Athenians</HI> by their re&s;tle&s;s Ambition had re|mov'd
the Seat of it, and drew into the Quarrel
new Enemies, who were of them&s;elves almo&s;t

<P><PB N="331" REF="365">
The News of this Defeat was not ea&s;ily cre|dited

and exclaim'd again&s;t their Prophets,
and Prie&s;ts, who by a Religious Pretext had
footh'd them with hopes of conquering <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and betray'd them into all the&s;e Mi&s;erics. How|ever
they re&s;olv'd not to &s;ink under them, but
to equip a Fleet, in order to &s;upport their Al|lies,
who began now to think of throwing off
their Yoke: And even tho&s;e who had &s;tood
Neuter, took this occa&s;ion to declare again&s;t
them. But the <HI>Lacedoemonians</HI> being more par|ticularly
elevated, re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute the
War with Vigour; and the Winter was &s;pent in
Preparations on both Sides.</P>
<P>This Year by the Management of <HI>Alcibiades</HI> a
League was concluded between the King of <HI>Per|s&s;ia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 92. 1 <HI>A League between the</HI> Lacedae|monians, <HI>and the</HI> Per&s;ian.</NOTE> and the <HI>Lacedaemonians;</HI> and the principal Ci|ties

this time, that the thou&s;and Talents, which the
<HI>Athenians</HI> had &s;et apart for Ca&s;es of Extremi|ty,
was employ'd in Shipping, and other Pro|vi&s;ions.
The <HI>Athenians</HI> chas'd twenty <HI>Pelopon|ne&s;ian</HI>
Ships into the <HI>Piraeus,</HI> and block'd them
up; but the latter watching their Opportunity
forc'd their Pa&s;&s;age, and took &s;our of the <HI>Athe|nians.</HI>
Upon a De&s;cent of the <HI>Athenians</HI> near
<HI>Panormus</HI> in the <HI>Milesian</HI> Territories, a Fight

<PB N="332" REF="366">
But the truth is, he began to be envy'd at

He advis'd him <HI>To furni&s;h them but
&s;paringly with Mony; and to keep the Ballance &s;o
even betwixt</HI> Athens <HI>and</HI> Sparta, that he might
<HI>wear them out, and con&s;ume them in&s;en&s;ibly and
when they had wa&s;ted their Strength upon one ano|ther,
they would both become an ea&s;ie Prey to his
King.</HI> By which means he was hinder'd from
a&s;&s;i&s;ting them vigorou&s;ly, and from finally
ruining the <HI>Athenians.</HI> At the &s;ame time he
practis'd with the <HI>Athenians,</HI> who&s;e chief
Strength then lay at <HI>Samos,</HI> about his being recall'd;
and as a Condition of it, gave them
hopes, <HI>That he would make</HI> Ti&s;&s;aphernes <HI>their
Friend; Provided al&s;o, that they would re|form
the Government, which was administer'd
by ill Men, and put it into fewer Hands.</HI> The
chief Man who oppos'd his Return, was <HI>Phry|nicus</HI>
one of the Generals, who to compa&s;s his
De&s;igns, &s;ent word to <HI>A&s;tyochus</HI> the <HI>LacedAemo|nian</HI>
General, that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> was treating with
<HI>Ti&s;&s;apherncs,</HI> to bring him over to the <HI>Athenian</HI>
Intere&s;t. He offer'd further, to betray to him
the whole Army and Navy of the <HI>Athenians:</HI>
But his trea&s;onable Practices being all detected
the good Under&s;tanding betwixt <HI>Alcibiades,</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="367">
and <HI>A&s;tyochus,</HI> he was laid a&s;ide, and afterwards
&s;tabb'd in the Market-place.</P>
<P>This Year began with the Revolt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olym. 92. 2</NOTE> and Re|covery
of &s;everal Places towards the <HI>Helle&s;pont.</HI>
The Treaty was &s;till on foot with <HI>Alcibiades;</HI>
and to bring it to an I&s;&s;ue, the <HI>Democracy</HI> was
aboli&s;h'd in &s;everal Cities &s;ubject to <HI>Athens,</HI> any
&s;oon after in <HI>Athens</HI> it &s;elf, way being mad
for it by the Murder of <HI>Androcles,</HI> and others
who appear'd mo&s;t violent for the People: So
that the Government was now re&s;train'd to
four hundred Men in the Nature of an <HI>Oli|garchy.</HI>
The manner of effecting this Change
was by ten Men, who for fear of being in&s;ul|ted
by the People, obtain'd leave; <HI>That what|ever
they &s;hould propo&s;t, might be without dan|ger
of incurring any Penalty by the Laws.</HI> He
who appear'd chiefly in the Tran&s;action of this
Affair, was <HI>Pi&s;ander:</HI> But the whole Scheme
of it was laid down by <HI>Antiphon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aniphon <HI>his Chara|cter.</HI></NOTE> a Man for
his Virtue, and Abilities not inferior to any of
his time: For no Man thought ju&s;ter than he,
or expre&s;s'd his Thoughts better. But find|ing
the People jealous of his Merit$punc; and the
Force of his Eloquence, he avoided all Occa|&s;ions
of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf in the A&s;&s;em|blies;
yet did not de&s;ert the Service of his
Country, tho' he did not appear in it. For
his Advice was generally ask'd, and follow'd,
as well in the mo&s;t important Exigencies of
State, as in private Suits in the Courts of Ju|&s;tice.
When upon the next Change of the
Government he was impeach'd, and try'd for
his Life, as being in&s;trumental in it, he made
the be&s;t Defence of any Man to that Day in
<HI>Athens.</HI> The four hundred Men thus aurho|ris'd,

were conducted to the Senate-Hou&s;e with
Guards,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Go|vernment of the four hundred in</HI> Athens.</NOTE> and Daggers under their Coats, where the

bani&s;hing, and killing &s;uch as they
thought obnoxious; and in the mean while
&s;ent to treat with <HI>Agis</HI> about a Peace. But he
was &s;o far from hearkening to their Propo&s;als,
that he took this Occa&s;ion to advance to|wards
<HI>Athens,</HI> in hopes the City would &s;ur|render
under its pre&s;ent Con&s;ternation; 'till
finding the People ob&s;tinate in their Defence,
he was forc'd to retire to <HI>Decelea.</HI></P>
<P>The Army in the mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alcibiades <HI>recal$'d and created General.</HI></NOTE> which was

in the City; and at the Per&s;uasion of <HI>Thra&s;y|bulus</HI>
recall'd <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and created him Ge|neral,
with full Power to &s;ail directly to the
<HI>Piraeus,</HI> and cru&s;h this new Tyranny. He
would not give way to this ra&s;h Opinion; but
went fir&s;t to &s;hew him&s;elf to <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes,</HI> and
let him know, <HI>That it was now in his Power
to treat him as a Friend, or an Enemy:</HI> By
which means he aw'd the <HI>Athenians</HI> with <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes,</HI>
and <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes</HI> with the <HI>Athenians.</HI>
When afterwards <HI>the four hundred</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Sa|mos</HI>
to vindicate their Proceedings, the Army
was for putting the Me&s;&s;engers to Death, and
per&s;i&s; in the &s;ign upon the <HI>Piroeus;</HI> but
<HI>Alcibiades</HI> by oppo&s;ing it, manife&s;tly &s;av'd the

had kill'd <HI>A&s;tyochus</HI> their Admiral, if he had
not taken Sanctuary: But he was &s;oon after
di&s;charg'd from his Command of the Fleet, and
&s;ucceeded by <HI>Mindarus.</HI> The <HI>Laccdoemonians</HI>
had for &s;ome time been di&s;&s;atisfyd with <HI>Ti&s;&s;aphernes,</HI>

by detaining a great <HI>Phoenician</HI> Fleet,
which should have come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance;
the Acce&s;&s; of which to either Party would
have enabled them to ravi&s;h intirely the Do|minion
of the Sea from the other Side, and to
have put an End to the War. Whatever his
De&s;igns were, it was a great piece of Service
done to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and is generally a&s;crib'd

<P>In the mean while the Innovation in <HI>Athens</HI>
had occa&s;ion'd &s;uch Factions, and Tumults,

providing for their Safety, than pro&s;ecuting

the publick Stock, but his private Fortune: That
being in continual Danger of his Life, he was
forc'd to care&s;s his greate&s;t Enemies; and tho' he
&s;aw the Mi&s;carriages of State, yet was render'd
incapable by his Exile, of &s;erving his deare&s;t

they imputed wholly to his Ab&s;ence, as on the

Sufferings and their U&s;age of him, but touch'd
the latter &s;o gently and modestly, that he im|puted
all to his hard Fortune, and &s;ome ill
<HI>Genius,</HI> that attended him. Upon which they
created him <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> both at Land and

Country to its ancient Grandeur. They gave
him back his E&s;tate, and order'd the <HI>Eumol|piles,</HI>

He &s;o won upon the meaner &s;ort of People,
that they pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ir'd he would take
the Sovereignty upon him: Some of 'em made
no Difficulty to tell him &s;o, and advi&s;e him <HI>to

and Manners of his Country. He was brave,
and a&s;piring, and like his Countrymen, &s;acrific'd
all &s;orts of Plea&s;ure to his Ambition. He
had an Evenne&s;s and Sedatene&s;s of Temper,
which made all Conditions of Life fit ea&s;ie
upon him; but withal was extremely in&s;inuating,
crafty, and de&s;igning, and made his In|tere&s;t
the only Mea&s;ure of Truth and Fal&s;hood.
This deceitful Temper was ob&s;erv'd to run
through the whole Cour&s;e of his Life; upon
which Occasion it was &s;aid, <HI>That he cheated

And it was a Maxim of his own, <HI>That when

<P>In di&s;charge of this new Office he put to

the Fleet to <HI>Antiochus</HI> his Vice-Admiral, with
expre&s;s Command not to engage, tho' the E-nemy
&s;hould provoke him. But he was &s;o far

Provocations po&s;&s;ible to draw out the Ene|my.
<HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> at fir&s;t mann'd out a few Ships to
give him Chafe; upon which the whole <HI>Athe|nian</HI>

remain'd, to be made at <HI>Samos,</HI> and offer'd to
renew the Fight; but <HI>Ly&s;ander</HI> content with

referr'd 'em. to the <HI>Ephori at Sparta;</HI> to whom
they made Propo&s;als of Parting with all Places,

told 'em, <HI>They would not de&s;troy a City,
which had &s;o eminently re&s;cu'd</HI> Greece <HI>in the

I have my Eye, fays he, upon</HI> Themi&s;tocles <HI>his

what he wants in the Contrivance of his <HI>Fables,</HI>

Honour of this Poet, that after the la&s;t great
Defeat of the <HI>Athenians</HI> before <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> many
of the Pri&s;oners were releas'd, only for repeat|ing

from this Period,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The full Age of Po|etry.</HI></NOTE> that we are to date <HI>The full

no Art made quicker, or f$mer Advances than
this. It had indeed for &s;ome Ages been made
&s;ub&s;ervient chiefly to the Propagation of Reli|gion,
Government, and Philo&s;ophy: But Su|per&s;tition,
and Knowledge of all kinds having by
degrees gather'd Strength enough, to convey
and enforce their Doctrines without the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of Ver&s;e, the <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> by this means was di|ve&s;ted
of tho&s;e &s;everer Ornaments, and ap|pear'd
in her more natural Colours, with an
Air of Wit, and Gaiety, and Politene&s;s. The
<HI>Grecian</HI> Mu&s;e was particularly happy in being
&s;upported by a Language, that was &s;mooth
and mu&s;ical, and yet full and expre&s;&s;ive; and
that Variety of <HI>Dialects,</HI> which is generally a
Corruption in other Languages, was not the
lea&s;t of its Beauties. This prov'd &s;uch a migh|ty
Encouragement, that every one &s;trove to
excel; and &s;ome by varying their Numbers,
and others their Subjects, &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
as to reduce Poetry to an Art, and by their
Writings to fix a Standard in their &s;everal kinds
to &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Hero</HI> in Philo&s;ophy at this time
was <HI>Socrates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrates.</NOTE> of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion
