<BIBL>PROV. XX. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>MY SON, FEAR THOU THE LORD AND
THE KING, AND MEDDLE NOT WITH
THEM THAT ARE GIVEN TO CHANGE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are this day a&s;&s;embled, to expre&s;s our ab|horrence
of an action which involved our
forefathers in <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>infamy;</HI> and to depre|cate
that vengeance, which, for &s;uch an unheard-of-crime,
may ju&s;tly be inflicted on us their children.</P>
<P>As we look not for any re&s;urrection of the <HI>body-politic,</HI>
and as in the future world there will be no di&s;|tinction
of nations, but each individual will be re|warded
according to his works&mdash;the guilt of nations
(if puni&s;hed at all) <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be puni&s;hed in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate.</P>
<P>That nations, as &s;uch, are capable of guilt, and that
they are, by con&s;equence, liable to puni&s;hment, is the
doctrin of Scripture, and mu&s;t be admitted by every
man who believes in GOD'S moral government of the
world.</P>
<P>That the puni&s;hment of nations may be delayed,
'till their iniquities be <HI>full,</HI> is likewi&s;e &s;u$ficiently ob|vious.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
That the guilt, which we now deplore, was <HI>in &s;ome
&s;en&s;e</HI> national needs no proof: the nation confe&s;&s;es it;
and every one knows that it was by a <HI>pretended</HI> national
authority, that the virtuous Sovereign was brought to
the block.</P>
<P>To prevent the iniquities of our fathers from being
vi&s;ited on us, in a national manner; the <HI>only</HI> manner,
I apprehend, that the &s;ins of the fathers are ever vi&s;ited
on their children; it will be our wi&s;dom to avoid their
ways, tho&s;e ways which they pur&s;ued in attempting, by
violent methods, to <HI>reform the Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem then that I cannot better fulfil the
purpo&s;e for which I &s;tand here, than by endeavoring to
per&s;uade you &startq;to fear the Lord and the King, and not
to meddle with them that are given to change.&endq;</P>
<P>To this end, it is propo&s;ed to &s;hew you that Civil
Government is the ORDINANCE OF GOD: and then
I &s;hall point out the danger and the &s;in of making <HI>vio|lent
innovations</HI> in any con&s;titution of government
whatever, that has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to which
the people have been accu&s;tomed quietly to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>FIRST, the nature of man&mdash;the con&s;titution of
his mind as well as of his body&mdash;&s;hews clearly that his
Creator intended him for <HI>Society.</HI> No other animal is
$ent into the world in &s;o <HI>helple&s;s a condition</HI> as this <HI>Lord
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of the Creation;</HI> naked, yet unfitted to bear the incle|mencies
of the weather; nece&s;&s;arily requiring food, yet
utterly unable to procure it for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, if de&s;titute of parental protec|tion,
<HI>few and evil</HI> would be the <HI>moments</HI> of his life.
Thus totally dependent mu&s;t <HI>every</HI> de&s;cendant of
Adam be contented to remain during the period of in|fancy
and childhood&mdash;in the more rigid climates, du|ring
a much longer one.</P>
<P>When he arrives at that &s;tage of life at which he may
be &s;uppo&s;ed capable, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to take care of
him&s;elf; &s;hould he &s;eparate from his parents, and
roam alone among the wilds, he might, perhaps, in the
more favorable regions of the globe, be able to &s;upport,
for a few years, a wretched exi&s;tence;&mdash;But to render
life, in any degree, plea&s;ant and de&s;irable, many more
things are <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> than can po&s;&s;ibly be pro|vided
by the labor and ingenuity of an <HI>individual.</HI></P>
<P>Should this <HI>&s;olitary</HI> man take, from the other &s;ex,
&s;uch a help, as inclination might prompt him to &s;eek,
or as accident might bring within his reach, by that a&s;|&s;ociation
his <HI>hands</HI> would indeed be doubled, but &s;o
would his <HI>wants</HI> too: in the <HI>rearing</HI> (for we &s;peak not
of the <HI>education</HI>) of children, he would &s;oon encounter
difficulties &s;o numerous and &s;o formidable, that the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;tretch of imagination cannot conceive him <HI>able,</HI>
if <HI>d$&s;p$&s;ed,</HI> to overcome them.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e all the&s;e wants &s;upplied, all the&s;e ob|&s;tacles
&s;urmounted, and a <HI>family grown up.</HI> Suppo&s;e that
little community <HI>doing</HI> all that a &s;ingle family is <HI>capable
of doing,</HI> towards &s;upporting them&s;elves, by gardening
and agriculture, by hunting and by a few cattle, ca&s;u|ally
got and tamed; <HI>The&s;e</HI> occupations would engro&s;s
their <HI>whole</HI> time; leaving neither lei&s;ure nor inclination
for aught be&s;ide. Man's <HI>higher faculties</HI> would remain
unemployed and uncultivated; for tho&s;e arts and &s;ci|ences
which are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to teach men
how to u&s;e their nobler faculties, and to unfold their
rea&s;on, are not the growth of &s;ingle families.</P>
<P>Hence, in &s;uch a &s;tate, man mu&s;t remain a &s;tranger
to religion and morality. He could have no knowledge
of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t beneficent of beings, by whom
he was created, and would little &s;urpa&s;s, in ex|cellence
or dignity, his brethren the bea&s;ts of the
fore&s;t.</P>
<P>That this is not a vi&s;ionary theory is evident from
the hi&s;tory of the <HI>new</HI> world. When that immen&s;e
continent was fir&s;t di&s;covered, &s;uch of its inhabitants
as lived in disjointed independent families, or in very
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;mall tribes, were exactly in this degenerate &s;tate,
&s;trangers to all the arts, and to all the comforts, of
life, and, &startq;without GOD in the world&endq;, they carried
about with them &s;carcely any marks of humanity but
their <HI>form.</HI> In the <HI>kingdoms,</HI> where &s;ociety was formed,
and a regular &s;ubordination e&s;tabli&s;hed, the ca&s;e was
far otherwi&s;e. The people were in a degree civilized,
they had &s;ome acquaintance with many of the <HI>arts,</HI> the
<HI>elegances,</HI> and even the <HI>luxuries</HI> of life. And altho' by
the <HI>nature</HI> of their governments, and their <HI>mon&s;trous
idolatries,</HI> they were prevented from attaining to that
degree of knowledge and politene&s;s which has been at|tained
by nations upon whom &startq;the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s
hath ari&s;en&endq;, yet, when compared with the <HI>wandering
tribes</HI> around them, they were happy, intelligent, and
polite.</P>
<P>Now as that &s;uperiority in improvement could be
owing to nothing but the mutual aid <HI>afforded by &s;ociety;</HI>
and as the human race, when out of &s;ociety, degene|rates
<HI>almo&s;t</HI> to the level of the brute-creation, SOCIETY
mu&s;t undoubtedly be the &s;tate intended for man by his
Maker.</P>
<P>But &s;ociety nece&s;&s;arily implies laws and &s;ubordina|tion.
A number of men living together in a &s;tate of
ab&s;olute equality, and indulging each his own humor,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
would form a confu&s;ed rabble: in&s;tead of affording one
another mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &startq;every man would do what
is right in his own eyes;&endq; every man would gra&s;p at as
much as he could; and, in the general &s;cramble, the
&s;trong would de&s;troy the weak.</P>
<P>In <HI>modern philo&s;ophy,</HI> the &s;ocial affections hold a very
con&s;picuous place; and from the certain exi&s;tence, and
&s;uppo&s;ed influence, of the&s;e affections, have torrents of
&s;en&s;ele&s;s declamation been poured forth in prai&s;e of the
<HI>&s;tate of nature;</HI> of that <HI>imaginary &s;tate</HI> in which, during
the early ages of the world, men are <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to have
lived together, while every man was <HI>his own legi&s;lator.</HI></P>
<P>That there <HI>never was</HI> &s;uch a &s;tate as this, all the re|cords
of antiquity, to which any credit is due (with the
books of Mo&s;es at the head of them) agree in a&s;&s;uring
us. That there <HI>never could have been</HI> &s;uch a &s;tate, is
almo&s;t &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>For, tho' it cannot be denied that there is implanted
in the human heart A PUBLIC AFFECTION, which
makes even <HI>children</HI> delight in &s;ociety; yet in minds un|cultivated,
that public affection hath but little &s;trength,
and is by no means &s;ufficiently enlarged to comprehend
the <HI>whole &s;pecies,</HI> or even <HI>many individuals.</HI></P>
<P>How far, for in&s;tance, does the public affection of a
low illiterate clown extend? <HI>Probably,</HI> not beyond the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
limits of his own family, and neare&s;t relations, <HI>certainly</HI>
not beyond the limits of the village or pari&s;h wherein he
re&s;ides: And when public affection oppo&s;es it&s;elf to
the principle of &s;elf-love, in every <HI>uncultivated</HI> mind,
in the high or low, it is always foiled in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed, were mankind compounded of nothing but
<HI>pure intellect and public affection</HI>&mdash;or (&s;uch beings as they
are) did the intere&s;ts of <HI>one</HI> never interfere with tho&s;e of
<HI>another;</HI> they might, perhaps, even in SOCIETY, be
left to the guidance of their own rea&s;on, to the influ|ence
of their own internal feelings.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t man is a compound of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>appetite$,</HI>
of <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> affections; and, much more, whil&s;t
the intere&s;ts of <HI>one</HI> man are &s;o frequently <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> by tho&s;e
of <HI>another,</HI> it is pa&s;t di&s;pute that po&s;itive laws are ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to render &s;ociety either <HI>comfortable</HI> or <HI>u&s;e|ful;</HI>
and indeed to keep it together.</P>
<P>But laws, in the very idea of them, infer <HI>magi&s;trates</HI> of
<HI>different orders,</HI> and of various powers; and, as it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to multiply powers to <HI>infinity,</HI> there mu&s;t&punc; in
every &s;tate, be &s;ome <HI>man,</HI> or <HI>body of m$n,</HI> ve&s;ted with &s;u|preme
and uncontroulable authority. This can only be
the <HI>legi&s;lature,</HI> to which all <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>executive</HI> powers
mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be &s;ubject; and to the decrees of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
which every individual of the &s;tate is bound to pay obe|dience,
as he values the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety,</HI> and as he would
&s;hun the <HI>horrors of anarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever therefore, in the wild &s;allies of imagina|tion,
men of warm genius may have advanced in favor
of <HI>ab&s;olute liberty,</HI> and <HI>boundle&s;s freedo$,</HI> it mu&s;t be plain
to every one (who can conceive the difference between
the cabin of a &s;avage and a commodious hou&s;e, between
a rude barbarian and an enlightened religious philo&s;o|pher,
between a people living wild in caves and woods,
and a nation in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ea&s;e and affluence) that
<HI>government</HI> is the true and &s;olid ba&s;is of <HI>rational free|dom,</HI>
and the &s;ole foundation of all that can be &s;tyled
dignity and happine&s;s in this world.</P>
<P>But, whatever is e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of man
mu&s;t be agreeable to the will of GOD, who cannot be
imagined to have had any other view in creation than
the felicity of his creatures.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;upreme authority to
enact laws, and to puni&s;h the violators of them, is as
convincing a proof that <HI>civil government</HI> is a <HI>divine ordi|nance,</HI>
as St. Paul's declaration to that purpo&s;e, in his
epi&s;tle to the Romans.</P>
<P>Particular <HI>forms</HI> of government (the force of which
depending little on the tempers of men we may deduce
<PB N="9" REF="10">
from them con&s;equences <HI>only not</HI> as certain and general
as from mathematical &s;ciences) may be devi&s;ed on <HI>earth;</HI>
and they may be different in different nations, but &s;till,
let us attend to a mo&s;t important di&s;tinction in this
matter, altho' <HI>forms</HI> of government may be of <HI>man's</HI> de|vice,
<HI>&s;o</HI> is not <HI>government it&s;elf;</HI> that is from <HI>above,</HI> for
&startq;the mo&s;t High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whom&s;oever he will.&endq;</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to trace government from its rude origin,
thro' all the &s;tages of perfection and refinement of which
it is capable, is foreign from my purpo&s;e, and far be|yond
the limits of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, neither &s;hall I
wa&s;te your time in comparing the <HI>various forms</HI> of go|vernment
exi&s;ting in divers countries; and in a fruitle&s;s
endeavor to decide peremptorily which of them is <HI>be&s;t:</HI>
It is my bu&s;ine&s;s to proceed, under the direction of the
text, to &s;hew the danger and the &s;in of making <HI>violent
innovations</HI> in any form that hath been long and quietly
e&s;tabli&s;hed. &startq;My &s;on, fear thou the Lord and the
King, and meddle not with them that are given to
change.&endq;</P>
<P>Altho' the wi&s;e man <HI>particularly</HI> &s;pecifies the <HI>King</HI> as
the power which, after GOD, it is our duty to fear; yet
it is not to be imagined that his prohibition again&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="11">
&startq;meddling with them that are given to change&endq; is ap|plicable
<HI>only</HI> to per&s;ons living under kingly governments.</P>
<P>The <HI>danger</HI> to be apprehended from <HI>innovations</HI> is as
great, perhaps greater, in popular than in monarchical
forms. No great and <HI>violent</HI> change can be effected in any
con&s;titution, but by armed force; now &s;hould an ab&s;o|lute
prince be &s;lain, and the government be di&s;&s;olved,
that form, being &s;imple and uniform, may be <HI>in&s;tantly
re&s;tored</HI> by placing another monarch on the vacant throne.
But in a complicated con&s;titution, con&s;i&s;ting of various
parts, the lea&s;t <HI>innovation</HI> (provided it be <HI>perceptible</HI> by
the people at large) will not fail to &s;plit them into a
thou&s;and fierce and rancorous parties. If, while things
are in this &s;tate, the government be di&s;&s;olved (which in
&s;uch ca&s;es is always to be dreaded) <HI>when</HI> or <HI>how</HI> it may
be re&s;tored, can be known <HI>only</HI> to HIM &startq;who &s;tilleth
the raging of the &s;ea, and the madne&s;s of the people.&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing human is ab&s;olutely fixed: nations, as well
as individuals, are progre&s;&s;ive; and what was fit for the
la&s;t age, may not be proper for the next. Gentle alter|ations
in the modes of government are, perhaps, un|avoidable;
but great and violent innovations no <HI>indivi|dual</HI>
is entitled to make. Indeed &s;uch alterations are
very <HI>dangerous</HI> to be attempted even by the <HI>legi&s;lature
<PB N="11" REF="12">
it&s;elf,</HI> and if experience may be credited, much more <HI>ill</HI>
than <HI>good</HI> is ever to be expected from them.</P>
<P>The patrons of the propo&s;ed innovations may have
the <HI>be&s;t intentions,</HI> and yet, unle&s;s the <HI>whole community</HI>
&s;hould agree in &s;entiment as to its <HI>fitne&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> the
con&s;equence of introducing it may too probably be <HI>fatal.</HI>
For the &startq;beginning of &s;trife&mdash;e&s;pecially of political
&s;trife&mdash;is as when one letteth out water;&endq; at fir&s;t it
runs in a gentle rill, but, by degrees, the rill &s;wells into
a mighty torrent, that &s;weeps away every thing before
it.&mdash;</P>
<P>The u&s;ual pretence of tho&s;e &startq;who are given to
change&endq; is to <HI>redre&s;s grievances,</HI> and to <HI>reform the con|&s;titution.</HI>
One may, however, very &s;afely appeal to the
experience of all ages and nations, nay, to the com|mon
&s;en&s;e of all mankind, whether under the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> con|&s;titution
with which we are acquainted, the people
<HI>in general</HI> can &s;uffer any grievance equal to the mi&s;eries
of a civil war; and every <HI>violent</HI> innovation in the &s;tate
hath been and always will be attended by a civil war.</P>
<P>Nor are the horrors alluded to confined to the time
of the conte&s;t; by no means, for it hath been com|monly
found that, after civil broils, a return of peace
hath not brought back with it <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s.</HI>
Not to in&s;i&s;t upon the executions, pro&s;criptions, and
<PB N="12" REF="13">
confi&s;cations which mu&s;t inevitably take place, <HI>which|ever</HI>
party prevails&mdash;it is hardly to be expected that, if
the Sovereign prove victorious, the <HI>grievances</HI> complained
of &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed; an un&s;ucce&s;sful rebellion ha|ving
been ever found to &s;trengthen the government it
intended to de&s;troy; but, &s;hould &s;ucce&s;s declare for the
popular party, the leader of that party, at the head of a
victorious army, may ea&s;ily &s;eize the &s;upreme power,
and amply &s;upply by <HI>force</HI> what he wants of <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in&s;tead of finding their Con&s;titution <HI>reformed,</HI>
the people will feel them&s;elves en&s;laved by a <HI>military
tyrant;</HI> and perceive, when too late, that &startq;the little
finger of the <HI>Protector</HI> of their liberties is heavier than
the loins of their lawful Sovereign&endq;; that if the yoke
laid upon them <HI>formerly</HI> was heavy, that under which
they <HI>now</HI> groan is heavier; and that &startq;if they were <HI>before</HI>
cha&s;ti&s;ed with whips they are now &s;courged with &s;cor|pions.&endq;
This is the <HI>natural,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid the <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary,</HI>
i&s;&s;ue of every in&s;urrection again&s;t the Legi&s;lature.
The in&s;urgents are not <HI>&s;ure</HI> to obtain a better govern|ment,
but they <HI>are &s;ure,</HI> by overthrowing that which is
e&s;tabli&s;hed, to engage their fellow-citizens in civil wars,
cabals, factions, and univer&s;al confu&s;ion; and to open
a door for the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e horrid evils in future,
upon pretences the mo&s;t fal&s;e and frivolous.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
The love of our country then oppo&s;eth the <HI>overthrow</HI>
of &s;ubordination, and indeed every thing con&s;pires to
&s;hew that it is neither <HI>&s;afe</HI> nor <HI>lawful</HI> to &startq;meddle with
them that are given to change.&endq;</P>
<P>THIRDLY, If this <HI>general rea&s;oning</HI> be not &s;uffi|ciently
clear, the matter now under con&s;ideration may
be <HI>illu&s;trated</HI> by a &s;hort &s;ketch of the origin of that re|bellion
which made England &startq;a reproach unto our
neighbors, and a &s;corn and deri&s;ion to tho&s;e that were
round about us.&endq;</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t James &s;ucceeded to the Engli&s;h throne,
our Con&s;titution was very different from what it is at
pre&s;ent. The government was more arbitrary, the royal
prerogative le&s;s limited, and the liberties of the people
le&s;s accurately defined. The meetings of Parliament
were &s;o precarious, and the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions</HI> &s;o &s;hort, that when
men's eyes were directed upwards, in &s;earch of &s;overeign
power, the King <HI>alone</HI> was apt to &s;trike them as the <HI>only</HI>
permanent magi&s;trate inve&s;ted with the whole authority
of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Matters had gone on thus &s;o long, that (by a great
majority of the nation) Monarchy ab&s;olute, &s;imple,
and unmixed, was conceived to be the Government
of England; and Parliaments, con&s;i&s;ting of the three
e&s;tates of the realm, were &s;uppo&s;ed to form <HI>only</HI> the <HI>orna|ment</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
of the fabric, without being in any degree, <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI>
to its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>For more than a century before the acce&s;&s;ion of
James, all Engli&s;h Monarchs had uniformly claimed
the di&s;pen&s;ing power, that of exacting forced loans and
benevolences, of altering the cu&s;toms, and of creating
monopolies. And, be it remembered, that, during the
whole period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, &s;trict obedience had
been required to <HI>proclamations</HI> as to <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>James, as was very natural, thought him&s;elf entitled
to exerci&s;e <HI>all</HI> the powers which his predece&s;&s;ors had ex|erci&s;ed:
and, no doubt, e&s;teemed it his <HI>duty</HI> to tran&s;mit
tho&s;e powers to his &s;on. Being, however, pacific and,
perhaps, timid al&s;o, he contented him&s;elf with an o&s;ten|tatious
di&s;play, both in his &s;peeches and writings, of all
that, by his prerogative, he <HI>might do,</HI> whil&s;t in truth he
very rarely <HI>did</HI> any thing at all in matters of con&s;ider|able
importance. The&s;e occa&s;ional &s;tretches or exertions
of prerogative were commonly made too with &s;o little
dignity, and, for want of political courage, they were &s;o
frequently retracted, that they tended rather to <HI>dimi|ni&s;h</HI>
than to encrea&s;e the power of the crown.</P>
<P>The long peace which was pre&s;erved during the reign
of James afforded men lei&s;ure, and a general increa&s;e of
knowledge gave them ability, to rea&s;on upon the nature
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and de&s;ign of government, and to enquire into the
foundation of that prerogative of which the Monarch
was continually boa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The more enlightened part of the nation were not
long occupied in political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, before they di&s;co|vered
that the con&s;titutional a&s;&s;embly of the three
E&s;tates, of Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Com|mons,
mu&s;t have been in&s;tituted for &s;ome better and
higher purpo&s;e than merely to &s;erve as an organ of the
royal will. Men became now intent upon a&s;certaining
the rights of the &s;enate, and re&s;training the prerogative
of the crown.</P>
<P>The peaceable &s;y&s;tem of James afforded not any op|portunity
for accompli&s;hing the&s;e aims; and he never
deviated from pacific mea&s;ures until the concluding
year of his reign: <HI>Then</HI> he was, in &s;ome &s;ort, con|&s;trained,
by the clamors of his &s;ubjects, to enter into a
war with the mo&s;t powerful kingdom in Europe. To
his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or he left the <HI>pro&s;ecution</HI> of that con|te&s;t,
under a load of debt, and with an empty trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Charles in&s;tantly &s;ummoned a Parliament, whom he
addre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity and cordiality. Se|cure
in the affections of the Commons, with whom he
had lately become a favourite, he lightly mentioned his
need of a &s;upply; not doubting but that a compe|tent
<PB N="16" REF="17">
one would be liberally and chearfully granted for
the pro&s;ecution of <HI>their own war.</HI></P>
<P>The young King, however, was &s;oon convinced of his
mi&s;take; for the Commons (having voted a &s;upply, &s;o
&s;canty, as to evince an intention rather to mock their
Sovereign than to &s;upport the war) in&s;tantly preferred a
complaint of grievances.</P>
<P>For this conduct they did not, perhaps, de&s;erve much
blame. Their ance&s;tors had tamely yielded to practices
and to precedents favorable to ab&s;olute monarchy: it
was therefore ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>fix a choice,</HI> either
to abandon entirely the privileges of the people, or to
guard tho&s;e privileges with barriers more firm and pre|ci&s;e
than any hitherto provided by the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>With plea&s;ure they beheld the King engaged in a fo|reign
war, which could not fail to render him every day
more dependent upon his Parliament. It certainly was
natural, and in their opinion, allowable, to take advan|tage
of Charles's &s;ituation, and to extort from him
conce&s;&s;ions favorable to civil liberty.</P>
<P>However natural and ju&s;tifiable the&s;e &s;entiments
might be in the Commons, it could not be expected
that the King &s;hould entertain the &s;ame ideas.</P>
<P>Educated heir apparent to a crown, the prerogative
of which had long been undefined, and almo&s;t unlimi|ted,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
he could not fail to con&s;ider this attempt to erect
<HI>new ramparts</HI> again&s;t his <HI>authority,</HI> as a violent and in|defen&s;ible
innovation in the con&s;titution. <HI>He</HI> had ex|erci&s;ed
no authority&mdash;(he had not indeed had <HI>time</HI> or
<HI>opportunity</HI> to exerci&s;e any authority) which had not,
without complaint or murmur, been exerted by his pre|dece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Charles well knew that the grievances of which the
Commons complained were not the effect of any error
in <HI>his</HI> admini&s;tration&mdash;therefore to be thus de&s;erted in
the commencement of his reign, and of a war into which
popular clamor had driven his father, could not but ap|pear
to him cruel and deceitful. When he perceived, as
he &s;oon did, that this de&s;ertion was a prelude to en|croachments
upon his authority, and infringements on
his prerogative, he failed not to regard tho&s;e aims as
highly criminal and traiterous.</P>
<P>Nor need we wonder at this; the love of power being,
in &s;ome &s;ort, natural to the human mind; and few
men being di&s;po&s;ed <HI>willingly</HI> to &s;uffer any, but e&s;pe|cially
inferiors, to wre&s;t from them that influence to
which they &s;uppo&s;e their right to be indi&s;putable, how|ever
it may be di&s;puted.</P>
<P><HI>Po&s;&s;ibly,</HI> it might have been well for the King and the
kingdom if attention had been paid to the complaints of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the Commons; but before any man <HI>blame</HI> a King (whom the venerable Archbi&s;hop Secker &s;tyles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See his Sermon on 30th January, 1733.</NOTE> &startq;a willing and
a patient martyr to the con&s;titution&endq;) for endeavor|ing
to maintain <HI>unimpaired</HI> the prerogative of the Crown,
as he received it, let every reviewer of tho&s;e turbulent
&s;cenes lay his hand upon his heart, and &s;ay, as in the pre|&s;ence
of that GOD from whom no &s;ecret is hid, &startq;that,
had <HI>he</HI> been in the &s;ame elevated &s;tation, he would have
acted differently.&endq;</P>
<P>In vain hath it been objected that there are rights and
privileges <HI>unalienable</HI> from human nature; and that
upon <HI>the&s;e</HI> the Crown had long trampled: for, granting
the truth of this (which, however, is not &s;elf-evident) we
a&s;k whether it was rea&s;onable to expect that a young
King &s;hould, immediately after his acce&s;&s;ion, make
di&s;covery of this truth, which had lain &s;o long concealed;
or that, becau&s;e he had <HI>not</HI> di&s;covered it, he &s;hould, on
this account, be de&s;erted by tho&s;e who had hurried his
father into an expen&s;ive war?</P>
<P>The Commons, however, deaf to the &s;olicitations of
their Sovereign, and regardle&s;s, it &s;hould &s;eem, of the
glory of the nation, remained inflexible. Thus circum|&s;tanced,
it was <HI>natural,</HI> and who can &s;ay it was not <HI>wi&s;e,</HI>
for Charles to di&s;&s;olve &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly? The next
<PB N="19" REF="20">
which he called, as if the &s;ame men had every where
been returned, and as if no time had intervened between
the two parliaments, adopted the &s;ame principles, and
di&s;played the &s;ame views.</P>
<P>The third parliament at fir&s;t $eemed to be actuated by
a more candid &s;pirit, but events &s;oon proved that, for
violent purpo&s;es, they had a&s;&s;umed the ma&s;k of mode|ration.
Their <HI>petition of right</HI> having been granted, by
which as much liberty was &s;ecured to the &s;ubject, and
as much re&s;traint was impo&s;ed on the Sovereign, as the
circum&s;tances of the times, and the genius of the people,
could admit, there remained no longer any one <HI>real</HI>
grievance, of which the Commons could complain.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution was now re&s;tored to its primitive pu|rity;
and it was the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of the repre&s;en|tatives
of the people to &s;upport the Crown in the pro&s;e|cution
of the people's war; in which they had unequi|vocally
promi&s;ed to adhere to the King with their lives
and fortunes.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch been their conduct, they would have ju&s;ti|fied
the highe&s;t preten&s;ions to patrioti&s;m; they would
have de&s;erved the applau&s;e of their contemporaries, and
the admiration of their po&s;terity: But, alas! they had
other ends in view. Far from being &s;atisfied with this
important conce&s;&s;ion on the part of the Crown, the&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="21">
perver&s;e men were only thereby encouraged to make new
demands, and &s;uch as, had they been granted,
would have entirely changed our ancient con&s;titution
both in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>The King, extremely provoked by a factious &s;pirit
which he &s;aw that nothing could &s;atisfy, di&s;&s;olved this
parliament likewi&s;e; and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of &s;upport
from his people (among whom the &s;eeds of &s;edition had
been &s;own with a lavi&s;h hand) wi&s;ely made peace with
his foreign foes&mdash;altho' he had not been able to obtain
the object, for which his father had commenced, and he
him&s;elf had continued, the war. Di&s;gu&s;ted, and &s;urely
not without rea&s;on, at popular a&s;&s;emblies, a long period
was &s;uffered to elap&s;e before the King called another
parliament, and it is, perhaps, doubtful whether he
would <HI>ever</HI> have done &s;o, had he not been compelled by
a rebellion excited among his Scotch &s;ubjects, in behalf
of their factious pre&s;bytery and impious covenant.</P>
<P>An army of twenty thou&s;and fanatics, rendered de&s;|perate
and implacable by the cur&s;es which their preach|ers
denounced on &s;uch as &startq;went not forth to help the
Lord again&s;t the mighty,&endq; was marching to the bor|ders.
At this critical time a Parliament was &s;um|moned,
and one would conclude that <HI>real</HI> patriots could
have had no other object in view than the cru&s;hing &s;o un|provoked
<PB N="21" REF="22">
a rebellion. To cru&s;h this Scotch in&s;urrection
was, however, far from their wi&s;h: regardle&s;s of the
kingdom, and without de&s;igning to take any notice at
all of the royal application for nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, the
Commons entered immediately on their eternal com|plaint
of grievances.</P>
<P>Where great evils lie on all &s;ides, it is very difficult
to follow the be&s;t coun&s;els. The King was in the great|e&s;t
doubt and perplexity, and we cannot wonder that a
Parliament, which evidently had the peace of the king|dom
&s;o little at heart, was ha&s;tily di&s;&s;olved. The di&s;&s;o|lution
of this a&s;&s;embly was, however, a mea&s;ure of
which the unfortunate Charles &s;oon repented, and
which &s;ub&s;equent events, more than a thou&s;and argu|ments,
incline every one <HI>now</HI> to condemn.</P>
<P>The Scotch rebels mean-while marched into England,
and another Parliament was nece&s;&s;arily called. This a&s;|&s;embly
began with di&s;playing a di&s;po&s;ition more fierce and
unrelenting than had been vi&s;ible in any preceding one.
Far from enabling their Prince to &s;ubdue the in&s;ur|gents,
this Hou&s;e of Commons actually voted pay for
the <HI>Scotch rebels;</HI> with whom they kept up a con&s;tant
corre&s;pondence, and whom it was their avowed inten|tion
to retain until the King him&s;elf &s;hould be totally
&s;ubdued, and all their own republican purpo&s;es effected.
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&startq;We cannot <HI>yet</HI> &s;pare the Scotch,&endq; (&s;aid a popular
leader in the cant of tho&s;e times) &startq;the &s;ons of Zeruiah
are &s;till too &s;trong for us&endq; Encompa&s;&s;ed with ene|mies,
the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of the King's affairs determined
him to leave this Parliament <HI>to it&s;elf:</HI> a year had not
elap&s;ed before Charles beheld his mo&s;t faithful &s;ervant
mu$dered by them, him&s;elf &s;tripped of every branch of
the prerogative, and the entire authority of the &s;tate,
executive as well as legi&s;lative, a&s;&s;umed by the Hou&s;e
of Commons. All this <HI>could</HI> not have been effected by
the powers of rhetoric or of rea&s;on. The Hou&s;e and the
nation were deeply tinctured with fanatici&s;m, and the
pulpits, artfully and arbitrarily filled by the Commons
with preachers of that de&s;cription, re&s;ounded with faction
and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Hypocri&s;y, noi&s;e, and non&s;en&s;e expelled &s;ound piety
and &s;ober &s;en&s;e; and the &s;ole aim of the preachers was
to exa&s;perate the minds of the mob alike again&s;t the
King and the Bi&s;hops: Herein their &s;ucce&s;s certainly
equalled their wi&s;hes, and probably exceeded their ex|pectations.</P>
<P>A democracy of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t tyrannical &s;ort
had now &s;ucceeded to our free and ancient government;
and as Charles had been compelled to a&s;&s;ent to an Act
for making this Parliament perpetual, a civil war &s;eemed
<PB N="23" REF="24">
to be ab&s;olutely inevitable, before the con&s;titution could
be <HI>re&s;tored.</HI> Accordingly vigorous preparations were
made by each party for an appeal to the &s;word; it
matters not at all, which of them drew it <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the
King having been unque&s;tionably con&s;trained to arm
in &s;elf-defence: if, indeed, his troops fir&s;t took the
field, yet the Parliament had previou&s;ly wre&s;ted from
him the militia, they had &s;eized his ca&s;tles, and had ap|pointed
to them governors by their own authority.</P>
<P>To trace the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of that calamitous war is
no part of my plan; the <HI>i&s;&s;ue</HI> of it is but too
well known, and reflects indelible di&s;grace on this na|tion;
as, under pretence of <HI>amending,</HI> it <HI>overturned</HI> the
con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and murdered one of
the be&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed princes that ever wore
a crown.</P>
<P>Had Charles been born an ab&s;olute Monarch, his
humanity and his good &s;en&s;e would have rendered his
reign happy, and his memory precious. Had the limi|tations
of prerogative been, in his time, fixed, his in|tegrity
would have made him con&s;ider as &s;acred the
boundaries of the con&s;titution. Had the Parliament
re&s;tored to him his <HI>ju&s;t rights,</HI> after that tho&s;e rights had
been preci&s;ely a&s;certained, his high &s;en&s;e of honor, and
<PB N="24" REF="25">
his fear of GOD, would have prevented his ever &s;tretch|ing
the regal authority beyond its pre&s;cribed limits.</P>
<P>But the Commons had other ends in view. The
utter abolition of royalty was in truth the <HI>original</HI> aim
of all, who <HI>now</HI> remained in that factious a&s;&s;embly;
and one of their leaders, &s;oon after the murder of their
pious, virtuous, and mild Sovereign, confe&s;&s;ed in the
Hou&s;e that &startq;if they were for a King, the la&s;t was as
proper as any gentleman in England.&endq;</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the monarchy di&s;&s;olved than the Hou&s;e
of Peers was, very con&s;i&s;tently, voted to be u&s;ele&s;s; and
the Commons erected them&s;elves into a democracy, un|der
the denomination of &startq;keepers of the liberties of England.&endq;</P>
<P>This new form of government was very &s;oon over|turned
by a fanatical, hypocritical, military de&s;pot,
the arch-traitor Cromwell; who, &s;eizing the <HI>whole</HI> au|thority
of the &s;tate into his own hands, retorted upon
the Pre&s;byterian &s;ect, and the pretended patriots, part of
that &s;everity which they had exerci&s;ed towards the ad|herents
of the Church and the King.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of an attempt to reform the con|&s;titution
by violent means; even when its reformation
was confe&s;&s;edly needful. Upon this pretence were the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
di&s;turbances begun, and upon this pretence was the
monarch murdered.</P>
<P>&startq;Let not us therefore murmur, as &s;ome of them
al&s;o murmured, and were de&s;troyed of the de&s;troyer;&endq;
but let us rather learn wi&s;dom from the folly of our an|ce&s;tors,
and cautiou&s;ly avoid &startq;meddling with them that
are given to change.&endq; We enjoy the mo&s;t free and
equal government with which any age or nation was
ever ble&s;&s;ed: a government which (now that the boun|daries
of the con&s;titution are fixed) as far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth in
excellence the long famed polities of Athens and of
Rome, as <HI>they</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the de&s;poti&s;m of Per&s;ia and
the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>At the head of this government reigns a mo&s;t excel|lent
Prince, equally amiable in public and in private
life; a Prince who has uniformly acted like the fa|ther
of his people; and has pre&s;erved entire that con&s;ti|tution
both in Church and State, for the pre&s;ervation of
which his family was called to the Throne.</P>
<P>If, in return for his paternal care of us, we could be
&s;o ungrateful as to with-hold from him our cordial af|fection
and chearful obedience, we &s;hould de&s;erve to be
abhorred by GOD and good men, as a people whom
neither <HI>pa&s;t mi&s;eries</HI> nor <HI>pre&s;ent mercies</HI> can bind to their
duty.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
But, of di&s;loyalty there is, I flatter my&s;elf, little
room for apprehen&s;ion: The virtues of the Sovereign
have &s;ecured to him the hearts of his &s;ubjects. The
dread is (at pre&s;ent), from another quarter and of ano|ther
kind. I mean, from attempts, however well meant,
to reform the repre&s;entation of the people in the Hou&s;e
of Commons.</P>
<P>That our con&s;titution is <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> perfect, it would

<HI>conceived,</HI> we do not po&s;itively deny. For many the|ories
may be clearly conceived, which by the utmo&s;t hu|man
ingenuity are not reducible to practice.</P>
<P>It may, however, be confidently a&s;&s;erted that &s;o few
and &s;o unimportant are the defects, &s;o many and &s;o va|luable

Con&s;titution, as to render it highly probable that any

than to improve it.</P>
<P>The people, it is alleged, are <HI>not fairly</HI> and <HI>equally</HI> re|pre&s;ented.

from the <HI>pre&s;ent one?</HI> During all <HI>that</HI> time our <HI>rights and

<P>No plan of repre&s;entation could po&s;&s;ibly be devi&s;ed in
which the WHOLE NATION would agree: Why
then &s;hould we hazard the con&s;equences of an innova|tion,
which it is <HI>barely po&s;&s;ible</HI> might do &s;ome good; but
which is much more likely to <HI>create di&s;cord,</HI> and to pro|ceed
to lengths which were never intended? Every rank

doubtle&s;s, learn mo&s;t important le&s;&s;ons from the mi&s;|takes,
as well as from the crimes, of their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

to all men what&s;oever we would they &s;hould do unto
us,&endq; by applying (in every <HI>private</HI> and <HI>public</HI> calamity)
to the ever-pre&s;ent &s;ource of life, comfort, and ble&s;&s;ing,
we &s;hall happily experience that the <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> as well as
the <HI>power,</HI> of our great Redeemer is &startq;the &s;ame ye&s;terday,
to-day, and for ever.&endq; Safe under <HI>His</HI> protection, who alone
&startq;maketh men to $e of one mind in&endq; any commu|nity,
delivered from all corroding anxiety about lives,
liberties, and fortunes, we &s;hall chearfully pa&s;s the time
of our pilgrimage here in hope; and when called to
quit this &s;cene, wherein every thing is mutable, and
which affords <HI>nought good unmixed with ill,</HI> we &s;hall be
found meet to reli&s;h the occupations, and to ta&s;te the
delights, of that bli&s;sful Kingdom, which, by our ado|rable
Redeemer, hath been opened to all believers.</P>
<P>Now to that GOD whom all Chri&s;tians adore, to the
holy, ble&s;&s;ed, and glorious Trinity, three per&s;ons and
one GOD, be a&s;cribed all honor and glory, now and
for ever.</P>
