In the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year the clamorous voice of di&s;&s;atisfaction had been rai&s;ed by a &s;eries of di&s;ap|pointments and mi&s;carriages, which were imputed to want of intelligence, &s;agacity, and vigour in the admini&s;tration. The defeat of Braddock, the re|duction of O&s;wego and other forts in America, the delay of armaments, the neglect of opportunities, ineffectual crui&s;es, ab&s;urd di&s;po&s;itions of fleets and &s;quadrons, the di&s;grace in the Mediterranean, and the lo&s;s of Minorca, were numbered among the
<PB N="4" REF="30">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> misfortunes that flowed from the crude de&s;igns of a weak di&s;pirited m&mdash;y; and the pro&s;pect of their acquie&s;cing in a continental war brought them &s;till farther in contempt and dete&s;ta$ion with the body of the people. In order to conciliate the good|will of tho&s;e whom their conduct had di&s;obliged, to acquire a fre&s;h &s;tock of credit with their fellow-&s;ubjects, and remove from their own &s;houlders part of what future cen&s;ure might en&s;ue, they ad|mitted into a &s;hare of the admini&s;tration a certain &s;et of gentlemen, remarkable for their talents and popularity, headed by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge, the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious patriots of Great Britain, alike di&s;tingui&s;hed and admired for their uncon|querable &s;pirit and untainted integrity. The former of the&s;e was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the other chancellor of the Exchequer; and their friends were ve&s;ted with other honourable though &s;ubor|dinate offices.</P>
<P>So far the people were charmed with the pro|motion of individuals, upon who&s;e virtues and abilities they had the mo&s;t perfect reliance: but the&s;e new ingredients would never thoroughly mix with the old leaven. The admini&s;tration became an emblem of the image that Nebuchadnezzar &s;aw in his dream, the leg was of iron, and the foot was of clay. The old junto found their new a&s;&s;ociates very un&s;it for their purpo&s;es. They could neither per&s;uade, cajole, nor intimidate them into mea&s;ures which they thought repugnant to the true intere&s;t of their country. They combated in council every &s;uch plan, however patronized: they openly op|po&s;ed in parliament every de&s;ign which they deem|ed unworthy of the crown, or prejudicial to the

people, even though di&s;tingui&s;hed by the prede|liction<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> of the &s;&mdash;n. Far from bargaining for their places, and &s;urrendering their principles by capitulation, they maintained in office their inde|pendancy and candour with the mo&s;t vigilant cir|cum&s;pection, and &s;eemed determined to &s;hew, that he is the be&s;t mini&s;ter to the &s;overeign who acts with the greate&s;t probity towards the &s;ubject. Tho&s;e who immediately &s;urround the c&mdash;n, were &s;uppo&s;ed to have concealed the true charact rs of the&s;e faithful &s;ervants from the knowledge of their royal ma&s;ter; to have repre&s;ented them as ob&s;ti|nate, imperious, ignorant, and even lukewa$m in their loyalty; and declared, that with &s;uch col|leagues it would be impo&s;&s;ible to move the machine of g&mdash;t according to his m&mdash;y's inclination. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions artfully inculeated, produced the de&s;ired effect. On the ninth day of April Mr. Pitt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are com|manded to re&s;ign.</NOTE> by his maje&s;ty's command, re&s;ign$d the &s;eals of &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the &s;outhern d$$artment. In the room of Mr. Legge, the king was plea&s;ed to grant the office of chancellor of the Exchequer to the right honourable lord Mansfield, chief ju&s;tice of the court of King's Bench, the &s;ame per&s;onage whom we have characterized in the beginning of this Continuation under the name of Mr. Murray, &s;olicitor general, now promoted and enobled for his extraordinary merit and important &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The fate of Mr. Pitt was extended to &s;ome of his principal friends: the board of admiralty was changed, and &s;ome other removals were made with the &s;ame intention.</P>
<P>What was intended as a di&s;grace to Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge, turned out one of the mo&s;t &s;hining

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> circum&s;tances of their characters. The whole na|tion &s;eemed to ri&s;e up, as one man, in the vindica|tion of their fame; every mouth was opened in their prai&s;e; and a great number of re&s;pectable ci|ties and corporations pre&s;ented them with the free|dom of their re&s;pective &s;ocieties, inclo&s;ed in golden boxes of curious workman&s;hip, as te&s;timonies of their peculiar veneration. Nothing could be more expre&s;&s;ive of that reverence which ever waits on &s;uperior virtue, than the manner in which the na|tion di&s;played its re&s;pect and affection for tho&s;e two fellow citizens, who&s;e names will always be dear to Britain, while her &s;ons are warmed with the flame of hone&s;ty and freedom.</P>

The whole kingdom catched fire at the late changes; nor could the power, the cunning, and the artifice of a faction long &s;upport it again&s;t the united voice of Great Britain, which &s;oon pierced the ears of the &s;&mdash;n. It was not po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade the people, that &s;alutary mea&s;ures could be &s;ugge&s;ted or pur|&s;ued, except by the few, who&s;e zeal for the honour of their country, and &s;teady adherence to an up|right di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, had &s;ecured their con|fidence and claimed their veneration.

Upon this they re&s;ted the &s;ecurity and honour of the nation, as well as the public expectation of the &s;peedy and &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of a war, hitherto at|tended with di&s;graces and misfortunes. According|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge re&s;tored to their employ|ments.</NOTE> his maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to redeliver the &s;eals to Mr. Pitt, appointing him &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the &s;outhern department, on the twenty ninth day of June; and five days after the office of chan|cellor of the Exchequer was re&s;tored to Mr. Legge: promotions that afforded univer&s;al &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It would not, perhaps, be po&s;&s;ible to exclude from a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration all who were not per|fectly agreeable to the people: however unpopular the late mini&s;try might appear, &s;till they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient influence in the privy council, and credit in the hou&s;e of commons, to thwart every mea&s;ure in which they did not them&s;elves partake. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">A coali|tion of parties.</NOTE> con&s;ideration, and very recent experience, probably dictated the nece&s;&s;ity of a coalition, &s;alutary in it|&s;elf, and prudent, becau&s;e it was the only means of a&s;&s;waging the rage of faction, and healing tho&s;e divi&s;ions, more pernicious to the public than the mo&s;t mi&s;taken and blundering coun&s;els.

Other promotions likewi&s;e took place, with a de&s;ign to gratify the adherents of either party; and &s;o equal|ly was the royal favour di&s;tributed, that the utmo&s;t harmony has ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; ingredients &s;eem|ingly heterogeneous, have con&s;olidated into one uniform ma&s;s, &s;o as to produce effects far exceed|ing the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and this pru|dent arrangement has proved di&s;plea&s;ing only to tho&s;e whom violent party attachment had in&s;pired with a narrow and exclu&s;ive &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The accumulated lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of the preceding year, made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to retrieve the credit of the Briti&s;h arms and councils by &s;ome vigorous and &s;pirited enterprize, which &s;hould at the &s;ame time produce &s;ome change in the circum&s;tances of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, already depre&s;&s;ed by the repul&s;e at Colin, and in danger of being attacked by the whole power of France, now ready to fall upon him, like a torrent, which had &s;o lately &s;wept before it the army of ob&s;ervation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of France medita|ted.</NOTE> now on the brink of di&s;grace. A well planned and vigorous de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of France would probably give a deci&s;ive blow to the marine of that kingdom, and at the &s;ame time effect a powerful diver&s;ion in favour of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, and

Both were objects of great con|cern, upon which the &s;&mdash;n and m&mdash;y were &s;edulou&s;ly bent. His royal highne&s;s the duke, in a particular manner, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome enterprize of this nature, as the only expedient to obviate the &s;hameful convention now in agitation. The mini&s;try fore&s;aw, that by de&s;troying the ene|my's &s;hipping, all &s;uccours would be cut off from America, whither they were daily tran&s;porting troops; the Briti&s;h commerce &s;ecured, without tho&s;e convoys &s;o inconvenient to the board of ad|miralty, and to the merchants; and tho&s;e ideal fears of an inva&s;ion, that had in &s;ome mea&s;ure af|fected the public credit, wholly di&s;pelled. From the&s;e con&s;iderations a powerful fleet was ordered to be got in readine&s;s to put to &s;ea on the &s;horte&s;t notice, and ten regiments of foot were marched to the I&s;le of Wight. The naval armament, con&s;i&s;t|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|mand of the fleet given to Sir Edw.

Sir John Mor|daunt was preferred to take the command of the land forces; and both &s;trictly enjoined to act with the utmo&s;t unanimity and harmony.</P>
<P>Europe beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment the&s;e mighty preparations. The de&s;tination of the armament<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secrecy of the expe|dition.</NOTE> was wrapped in the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy: it ex|erci&s;ed the penetration of politicians, and filled France with very &s;erious alarms.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the impediments which ob&s;tructed the embarkation of the troops for &s;everal weeks, while Mr. P&mdash;ex|pre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s at the delay, and re|peatedly urged the commander in chief to expedite his departure; but a &s;ufficient number of tran&s;|ports, owing to &s;ome blunder in the contractors, had not yet arrived. The troops expre&s;&s;ed an eager impatience to &s;ignalize them&s;elves again&s;t the enemies of the liberties of Europe; but the &s;uper|&s;titious drew unfavourable pre&s;ages from the dila|torine&s;s of the embarkation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet &s;ails Sept. 8th.</NOTE> At la&s;t the tran&s;ports arrived, the troops were put on board with all expedition, and the fleet got under &s;ail on the eighth day of September, attended with the prayers of every man warmed with the love of his country, and &s;olicitous for her honour. The public, big with expectation, dubious where the &s;troke would fall, but confident of its &s;ucce&s;s, were impatient for tidings from the fleet; but it was not till the fourteenth that even the troops on board began to conjecture that a de&s;cent was me|ditated on the coa&s;t of France near Rochefort, or Rochelle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders i&s;|&s;ued by the gene|ral.</NOTE> On the evening of the fifteenth orders were i&s;&s;ued that confirmed their &s;u&s;picions, and &s;pread the utmo&s;t joy and alacrity among the men. Re|gulations were made with re&s;pect to the manner of landing; and the corps directed to attack, had in|junctions to march up vigorou&s;ly to the enemy, re&s;erving their fire till they came very near, and then running in upon them with their bayonets: orders which had all the air of a re&s;olution to do bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="110">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> The &s;eventeenth farther orders, re&s;pecting the debarkation, were i&s;&s;ued; but on the nineteenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some time lo&s;t by a &s;ignal to lay-to.</NOTE> the whole fleet was &s;urprized with a &s;ignal to lay-to, though the wind was fair, the night clear, and the headland di&s;tant about twenty leagues; in which &s;ituation eight hours, a &s;pace of time invalu|able in &s;uch a conjuncture, were lo&s;t, before the &s;ignal was made to proceed on their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the twentieth the fleet made the i&s;le of Oleron, and then Sir Edward Hawke &s;ent an order to vice|admiral Knowles, requiring him, if the wind per|mitted the fleet, to proceed to Ba&s;que road, to &s;tand in as near to the I&s;le of Aix as the pilot would<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral Knowles &s;ent to take Aix.</NOTE> carry him, with &s;uch &s;hips of his divi&s;ion as he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice, and to batter the fort till the garri&s;on &s;hould either abandon or &s;ur|render it. But the immediate execution of this order was fru&s;trated by a French man of war's &s;tanding into the very middle of the fleet, and continuing in that &s;tation for &s;ome time before &s;he di&s;covered her mi&s;take, or any of the captains had a &s;ignal thrown out to give chace.

<P>While the above &s;hips, with the addition of the Royal William, were attending the French man of war &s;afe into the river Garrone, the remainder of the fleet was beating to the windward off the I&s;le of Oleron; and the commander in chief pub|li&s;hing

<P>Any &s;oldier who fires away his ammunition, without or|der, will be accounted a di&s;|obeyer of military command, and puni&s;hed accordingly; and any man who flies from his co|lours under pretence of want|ing ammunition, or for other cau&s;es, will be put to death.</P>
<P>A &s;oldier is not to commit acts of barbarity, or cruel in|humanity, upon the inhabi|tants of the country, under pain of the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ment.

<P>The general does not doubt but that every part of the &s;er|vice will be chearfully and re|&s;olutely carried on by the troops, that from their beha|viour and conduct his maje&s;ty and their country may be &s;a|tisfied that nothing has been wanting on their part to pro|cure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

This, a French pilot on board<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> (Thierry) undertook; but after a &s;hip had been lightened for the purpo&s;e, vice-admiral Knowles reported that a bomb-ketch had run aground at above the di&s;tance of two miles from the &s;ort; upon which the project of battering or bombard|ing the fort was abandoned. The admiral likewi&s;e propo&s;ed to bombard Rochelle; but this overture was over-ruled for rea&s;ons which we need not men|tion. It was at length determined in a council of war, held on the eighth, to make a de&s;cent, and at|tack the forts leading to and upon the mouth of the river Charente. An order, in con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, was immediately i&s;&s;ued for the troops to be ready to go from the tran&s;ports to the boats preci&s;ely at twelve o'clock at night. A number of men of war's boats, under the command of a lieutenant, were appointed to attend each regiment, and to receive the grenadiers picquet companies, and in a number proportioned to their bulk; but with great caution not to overcrowd the boats. The colonel of each regiment was directed to land with the fir&s;t detachment, if it amounted to three companies. The troops were ordered to proceed &s;ilently and quietly to the place of rendezvous ap|pointed for the divi&s;ion, and then to receive their commands from a captain of a &s;hip of war, which they were enjoined &s;crupulou&s;ly to obey. It was &s;trongly recommended to the &s;oldiers to imitate the example &s;o lately before them, the cool and deter|mined valour that appeared in the attack of the I&s;le of Aix. They were required to form and at|tack whatever appeared before them on their fir&s;t landing; and colonel, now general King&s;ley, was

which the expedition was projected. The fir&s;t and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757. Procced|ings of the court of inqui|ry.</NOTE> mo&s;t important was a letter &s;ent to Sir John, now lord Ligonier, by lieutenant-colonel Clark. This letter had been frequently examined in the privy council, and contained in &s;ub&s;tance, That colonel Clark, in returning from Gibralter in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four, had tra|velled along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of France, to ob&s;erve the condition of the fortifications, and judge how far a de&s;cent would be practicable, in ca&s;e of a rup|ture between Great Britain and France. On his coming to Rochefort, where he was attended by an engineer, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the greate&s;t part of a good rampart, with a revetment, flanked only with redans; no outworks, no covert way, and in many places no ditch, &s;o that the bottom of the wall was &s;een at a di&s;tance. He remem|bered, that in other places, where the earth had been taken out to form the rampart, there was left round them a con&s;iderable height of ground, whence an enemy might draw great advantage: that for above the length of a front, or two or three hundred yards, there was no rampart, or even en|trenchment, but only &s;mall ditches, in the low and mar&s;hy grounds next the river, which however were dry at low water; yet the bottom remained muddy and &s;limy. Towards the river no rampart, no batteries, no parapet, on either &s;ide, appeared; and on the land &s;ide he ob&s;erved &s;ome high ground, within the di&s;tance of one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards of the town; in which condition, the colonel was told by the engineer, the place had remained for above &s;eventy years. To prevent giving umbrage, he drew no plan of
<PB N="22" REF="230">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the place, and even burnt the few &s;ketches he had by him: however, as to utility, the colonel de|clared him&s;elf as much &s;atisfied as if he had got a plan. He could not a&s;certain the direct height of the rampart; but thought it could not exceed twenty-five feet, including the parapet. The river might be about one hundred and thirty broad, and the entrance defended by two or three &s;mall re|doubts. As to forces, none are ever garri&s;oned at Rochefort, except marines, which, at the time the colonel was on the &s;pot, amounted to about one thou&s;and.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t intelligence the mini&s;try re|ceived of the &s;tate of Rochefort, which afforded &s;ufficient room to believe, that an attack by &s;ur|prize might be attended with happy con&s;equences. It was true, that colonel Clark made his ob&s;erva|tions in time of peace; but it was likewi&s;e pro|bable, that no great alterations were made, on ac|count of the war, as the place had remained in the &s;ame condition during the two or three la&s;t wars with France, when they had the &s;ame rea&s;ons as now to expect their coa&s;ts would be in&s;ulted.</P>
<P>The next information was obtained from Jo&s;eph Thierry, a French pilot, of the prote&s;tant religion, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal examinations before the privy council. This per&s;on declared, that he had fol|lowed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a pilot on the coa&s;t of France for the &s;pace of twenty years, and &s;erved as fir&s;t pilot in &s;everal of the king's &s;hips: that he had, in particular, piloted the Magnanime, before &s;he was taken by the Engli&s;h, for about twenty-two months, and had often conducted her into the road of the i&s;le of Aix; and that he was perfectly ac|quainted
<PB N="23" REF="240">
with the entrance, which, indeed, is &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> ea&s;y as to render a pilot almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary. The road, he &s;aid, afforded a good anchorage in twelve or fourteen fathom water, as far as Bayonne: the channel between the i&s;lands of Oleron and Rhe was three leagues broad, and the banks nece&s;&s;ary to be avoided near the land, except one called the Boiard, which is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by the breakers. He affirmed, that the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els might draw up clo&s;e to the fort of Aix, which he would under|take the Magnanime alone would de&s;troy: that the large&s;t &s;hips might come up to the Vigerot, two miles di&s;tant from the m$uth of the river, with all their cannon and &s;tores: that men might be landed to the north of fort Fouras, out of &s;ight of the fort, upon a meadow, where the ground is firm and level, under cover of the cannon of the fleet. This landing place he reckoned at about five miles from Rochefort, the way dry, and no way inter|cepted by ditches and mora&s;&s;es. Great part of the city was encompa&s;&s;ed by a wall; but towards the river, on both &s;ides, for about &s;ixty paces, it was inclo&s;ed only with palli&s;ades, without a fo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>To the intelligence of colonel Clark and Thier|ry, the mini&s;try added a &s;ecret account obtained of the &s;trength and di&s;tribution of the French forces; whence it appeared highly probable, that not more than ten thou&s;and men could be allowed for the defence of the whole coa&s;t, from St. Valery to Bourdeaux.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the above information the &s;ecret expedition was planned; in&s;tructions given to Sir John Mordaunt and admiral Hawke to make a vigorous impre&s;&s;ion on the French coa&s;t, and all
<PB N="24" REF="250">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the other mea&s;ures projected, which it was ima|gined would make an effectual diver&s;ion, by oblig|ing the enemy to employ a great part of their forces at home, di&s;turb and &s;hake the credit of their public loans, impair the &s;trength and re&s;our|ces of their navy, di&s;concert their exten&s;ive and dangerous operations of war, and, finally, give life, &s;trength, and lu&s;tre to the common cau&s;e and his maje&s;ty's arms.</P>
<P>The board of inquiry took next into con&s;idera|tion the &s;everal letters and explanatory in&s;tructions &s;ent to Sir John Mordaunt, in con&s;equence of &s;ome difficulties which might po&s;&s;ibly occur, &s;tated by that general in letters to the mini&s;ter, previous to his &s;ailing Then they examined the report made to Sir Edward Hawke by admiral Broderick, and the captains of men of war &s;ent to &s;ound the French &s;hore from Rochelle to fort Fouras, dated September the twenty-ninth; the re&s;ult of the councils of war on the twenty-fifth and twenty-eighth; Sir Edward Hawke's letter to Sir John Mordaunt on the twenty-&s;eventh, and the general's an&s;wer on the twenty ninth: after which Sir John Mordaunt was called upon to give his rea&s;ons for not putting his maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions and orders in execution This he did in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: The attempt on Rochefort, he under&s;tood, was to have been on the footing of a coup de main, or &s;urprize, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to execute, if the de&s;ign was di&s;covered, or the alarm taken. He al&s;o under&s;tood that an attempt could not be made, nay, that his maje&s;ty did not require it &s;hould, unle&s;s a proper place for debarking, and a &s;afe retreat for the troops, was di&s;covered; parti|cularly
<PB N="25" REF="260">
where the &s;hips could protect them, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> &s;afe communication with the fleet, and conveyance of &s;upplies from it, was found. His &s;entiments, he &s;aid, was confirmed by a paper, to this purpo&s;e, delivered to him by Sir John Ligonier, on his fir&s;t being appointed to command the expedition. It was likewi&s;e probable, he thought, that although Rochefort &s;hould have remained in the &s;ituation in which colonel Clark and the pilot Thierry had &s;een it three years before, yet that a few days prepa|ration could make it &s;ufficiently defen&s;ible again&s;t a coup de main. Judging, therefore, the depen|dance on &s;uch an operation alone improper, he ap|plied to the mini&s;try for two more old battalions, and artillery for a regular attack to force the place; which, from its con&s;truction, appeared as difficult to be made defen&s;ible again&s;t the latter, as ea&s;ily &s;ecured again&s;t the former. But this reque&s;t being re&s;u&s;ed, he &s;till thought it his duty to obey his or|ders on the footing the expedition was planned, e&s;pecially as he under&s;tood his in&s;tructions were di&s;cretionary, regarding the circum&s;tances of the time, the condition of the place, and the nature of the &s;ervice. He recited the po&s;itive and cre|dible intelligence received, as well before the em|barkation as during the voyage, of the alarm given to France, and the preparations made along the French coa&s;ts from Bre&s;t and St. Malo's to Roche|fort. The accidents that kept the fleet hovering along the coa&s;ts, and prevented the po&s;&s;ibility of an attempt by &s;urprize: the reports of all the gen|tlemen employed in &s;ounding the coa&s;ts, &s;o con|trary to the intelligence given by Thierry the pilot: the opinion of the council of war, by which he was

<P>Having con&s;idered all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and examined &s;everal officers who &s;erved in the expedi|tion, the court of inquiry gave in the following report to his maje&s;ty; a report, at that time, deem|ed equivocal, artful, and un&s;atisfactory.</P>

It is even thought that Sir John Mordaunt him&s;elf demanded to have his conduct &s;crutinized, by which method alone he was &s;en&s;ible his character could be re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. His maje&s;ty's warrant for holding a court-martial<NOTE PLACE="marg">A court-martial is appointed to try Sir John Mor|daunt.</NOTE> was accordingly &s;igned on the third day of December. The court was compo&s;ed of nine lieu|tenant-generals, nine major-generals, and three co|lonels, who &s;at on the fourteenth, and continued by &s;everal adjournments to the twentieth.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-general Sir John Mordaunt came pri&s;oner before the court, and the following charge was exhibited again&s;t him; namely, That he being appointed by the king commander in chief of his maje&s;ty's forces &s;ent on an expedition to the coa&s;t of France, and having receized orders and in|&s;tructions relative thereto from his maje&s;ty, under his royal &s;ign-manual, and al&s;o by one of his prin|cipal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, hath di&s;obeyed his maje&s;|ty's &s;aid orders and in&s;tructions. The proceedings of this court were nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the court of inquiry. The &s;ame evidences were examined, with the addition of Sir Edward Hawke's depo&s;ition; and a defence, differing in no e&s;&s;ential point from the former, made by the pri&s;oner; but the judg|ment given was clear and explicit. Sir John Mor|daunt was unanimou&s;ly found Not guilty, and therefore acquitted, while the public opinion re|mained unaltered; and many per&s;ons inveighed as bitterly again&s;t the lenity of the pre&s;ent court-martial, as they had formerly again&s;t the &s;everity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon a late unfortunate ad|miral. The evidence of one gentleman, in parti|cular,

<P>Before we quit the affairs of Britain, we cannot avoid mentioning a few occurrences which de&s;erve to be recorded, however de&s;ultory, unconnected, and incapable of hi&s;torical embelli&s;hment they may appear.

Many di&s;or|ders were committed on the&s;e occa&s;ions; and the people, incen&s;ed at the irregularity of the proceed|ings of tho&s;e gentlemen appointed to carry the act into execution, and with certain defects in the act,

<P>His maje&s;ty, having taken into con&s;ideration the incredible damage &s;u&s;tained by the commerce of the&s;e kingdoms, for want of proper harbours and forts on the we&s;tern coa&s;t to receive and pro|tect merchantmen, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order that a temporary &s;ecurity &s;hould be provided for the &s;hipping which might touch at Milford haven, until the fortifications voted in parliament could be erected.

<P>The enemy, in the mean time, were pur&s;uing the blow given at O&s;wego, and taking advantage of the di&s;traction that appeared in the Briti&s;h coun|cils. By their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in the preceding cam|paign, they remained ma&s;ters of all the lakes. Hence they were furni&s;hed with the means of practi&s;ing on the Indians in all the different di&s;|tricts, and obliging them, by rewards, promi&s;es, and menaces, to act in their favour. Every acce&s;|&s;ion to their &s;trength, was a real diminution of that of the Briti&s;h commander; but then the ignorance or pu&s;illanimity of &s;ome of the inferior officers in our back &s;ettlements was, in effect, more bene|ficial to the enemy than all the vigilance and acti|vity of Montcalm. In con&s;equence of the &s;hame|ful lo&s;s of O&s;wego, they voluntarily abandoned to the mercy of the French general the whole country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who had inviolably performed their engagements, or indeed that had pre&s;erved any &s;incere regard for the Briti&s;h government. The communication with the&s;e faithful allies was now cut off, by the impru|dent demolition of the forts we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the great Carrying place. A &s;trong fort, indeed, was built at Winche&s;ter, and called Fort Loudon, after the commander in chief, and four hundred Che|rokee Indians, joined the Engli&s;h forces at Fort Cumberland: but this by no means counterbal|lanced the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence of our having imprudently &s;topped up Wood creek, and filled it with logs. Every per&s;on, the lea&s;t ac|quainted

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> with the country, readily perceived the weakne&s;s of the&s;e mea&s;ures, by which our whole frontier was left open and expo&s;ed to the irruption of the &s;avages in the French intere&s;t, who would not fail to profit by our blunders, too notorious to e&s;cape them. By the removal of the&s;e barriers, a path was opened to our fine &s;ettlements on tho&s;e grounds called the German Flats, and along the Mohawk's river, which the enemy de&s;troyed with fire and &s;word before the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>In the mean time lord Loudon was taking the mo&s;t effectual &s;teps to unite the provinces, and rai&s;e a force &s;ufficient to give &s;ome deci&s;ive blow. The attack on Crown Point, which had been &s;o long meditated, was laid a&s;ide, as of le&s;s im|portance than the intended expedition to Loui&s;|bourg, now &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, and undoubt|edly a more con&s;iderable object in it&s;elf. Admiral Holbourn arrived at Hallifax, with the &s;quadron and tran&s;ports under his command, on the ninth of July; and it was his lord&s;hip's intention to repair thi$her with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, in order to take upon him the command of the expedition; but a variety of accidents interpo&s;ed. It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he at length a&s;&s;embled a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, with which he in&s;tantly began his march to join the troops lately arrived from England. When the junction was effected, the whole forces amounted to twelve thou&s;and men; an army that rai&s;ed great expectations. Imme|diately &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent out to examine and reconnoitre the condition of the enemy, and the intermediate time was employed in embarking the troops, as &s;oon as the tran&s;ports arrived. The
<PB N="37" REF="390">
return of the &s;couts totally altered the face of af|fairs:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> they brought the unwelcome news, that M. de Bois de la Mothe, who &s;ailed in the month of $word$ from Bre&s;t with a large fleet of men of war and tran&s;ports, was now &s;afe at anchor in the har|bour of Loui&s;bourg. Their intelligence was &s;up|ported by the te&s;timony of &s;everal de&s;erters; yet &s;till it wanted confirmation, and many per&s;ons believed their account of the enemy's &s;trength greatly magnified. Such advices, however, could not but occa&s;ion extraordinary fluctuations in the councils of war at Hallifax. Some were for &s;etting a&s;ide all thoughts of the expedition for that &s;ea&s;on; while others, more warm in their di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;anguine in their expectations, were for pro&s;e|cuting it with vigour, in &s;pite of all dangers and difficulties. Their di&s;putes were carried on with great vehemence, when a packet, bound from Loui&s;bourg for France, was taken by one of his maje&s;ty's &s;hips &s;tationed at Newfoundland. She had letters on board, which put the enemy's &s;upe|riority beyond all doubt, at lea&s;t by &s;ea. It clearly appeared there were at that time in Loui&s;bourg &s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, three thou&s;and na|tives, and one thou&s;and three hundred Indians, with &s;eventeen &s;hips of the line, and three frigates, moored in the harbour; that the place was well &s;upplied with ammunition, provi&s;ion, and every kind of military &s;tores; and that the enemy wi&s;hed for nothing more than an attack, which it was pro|bable would terminate to the di&s;grace of the a&s;|&s;ailants, and ruin of the Briti&s;h affairs in America. The commanders at Hallifax were fully apprized of the con&s;equences of an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt: it
<PB N="38" REF="400">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> was therefore almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to po&s;t|pone the expedition to &s;ome more convenient op|portunity, e&s;pecially as the &s;ea&s;on was now far ad|vanced, which alone would be &s;ufficient to fru&s;trate their endeavours, and render the enterprize abor|tive.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution &s;eems, indeed, to have been the mo&s;t eligible in their circum&s;tances, whatever con|&s;tructions might afterwards be given, with inten|tion to prejudice the public again&s;t the comman|der in chief. Lord Loudon's departure from New York, with all the forces he was able to collect, afforded the marquis de Montcalm the faire&s;t oc|ca&s;ion of improving the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the former campaign. That general had, in the very com|mencement of the &s;ea&s;on, made three different at|tacks on Fort-William-Henry, in all of which he was repul&s;ed by the vigour and re&s;olution of the garri&s;on. But his di&s;appointment here was bal|lanced by an advantage gained by a party of regu|lars and Indians at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Parker, with a detachment of near four hundred men, went by water, in whale and bay boats, to attack the enemy's advanced guard at that place. Landing at night on an i&s;land, he &s;ent before dawn three boats to the main land, which the enemy way laid and took. Having procured the nece&s;|&s;ary intelligence from the pri&s;oners of the colonel's de&s;igns, they contrived their mea&s;ures, placed three hundred men in ambu&s;h behind the point where he propo&s;ed landing, and &s;ent three battoes to the place of rendezvous. Colonel Parker, mi&s;|taking the&s;e for his own boats, eagerly put to &s;hore, was &s;urrounded by the enemy, reinforced with
<PB N="39" REF="410">
four hundred men, and attacked with &s;uch impe|tuo&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> that, of the whole detachment, only two officers and &s;eventy private men e&s;caped. Flu&s;hed with this advantage, animated by the ab&s;ence of the Briti&s;h commander in chief, then at Hallifax, and fired with a de&s;ire to revenge the di&s;grace he had lately &s;u&s;tained before Fort Henry, Montcalm drew together all his forces, with intention to lay &s;iege to that place. Fort William-Henry &s;tands on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of Lake George. It was built with a view to protect and cover the frontiers of the Engli&s;h colonies, as well as to command the lake. The fortifications were good, de&s;ended by a garri|&s;on of near three thou&s;and men, and covered by an army of four thou&s;and, under the conduct of general Webb, po&s;ted at no great di&s;tance. When the marquis de Montcalm had a&s;&s;embled all the forces at Crown Point, Ticonderoga, and the adja|cent po&s;ts, together with a con&s;iderable body of Canadians and Indians, amounting in the whole to near ten thou&s;and men, he marched directly to the fort, made his approaches, and with a good train of artillery began playing on the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>On the very day he inve&s;ted the place, he &s;ent a letter to colonel Monro, telling him, he thought him&s;elf obliged, in humanity, to de&s;ire he would &s;urrender the fort, and not provoke the great num|ber of &s;avages in the French army by a vain re|&s;i&s;tance. "A detachment of your garri&s;on has lately, &s;ays he, experienced their cruelty: I have it yet in my power to re&s;train them, and oblige them to ob&s;erve a capitulation, as none of them hitherto are killed; which will not be in my power in other circum&s;tances.

You may credit what he will inform you of, from Montcalm."</P>
<P>General Webb beheld his preparations with an indifference and &s;ecurity bordering on infatuation. It is credibly reported, that he had private intelli|gence of all the French general's de&s;igns and mo|tions; yet, either de&s;pi&s;ing his &s;trength, or di&s;|crediting the information, he neglected collect ng the militia in time, which, in conjunction with his own forces, would probably have obliged Mont|calm to relinqui&s;h the attempt, or, at lea&s;t, have rendered his &s;ucce&s;s very doubtful and hazardous. The enemy, meeting with no di&s;turbance from the quarter they mo&s;t dreaded, pro&s;ecuted the &s;iege with vigour, and were warmly received by the gar|ri&s;on, who fired with great &s;pirit, till they had bur&s;t almo&s;t all their cannon, and &s;pent their am|munition. Neither Montcalm's promi&s;es or threats could prevail upon them to &s;urrender, while they were in a condition to defend them&s;elves, or could rea&s;onably expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance from general Webb. They even per&s;i&s;ted to hold out after pru|dence dictated they ought to &s;urrender. Colonel Monro was &s;en&s;ible of the importance of his charge, and imagined that general Webb, though &s;low in his motions, would &s;urely make &s;ome vigorous ef|forts either to rai&s;e the &s;iege, or force a &s;upply of ammunition, provi&s;ion, and other nece&s;&s;aries into

the garri&s;on. At length nece&s;&s;ity obliged him, af|ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> &s;u&s;taining a &s;iege from the third to the ninth day of Augu&s;t, to hang out a flag of truce, which was immediately an&s;wered by the French comman|der. Ho&s;tages were exchanged, and articles of capitulation &s;igned by both parties; whereby the garri&s;on of Fort William-Henry, and the troops in the retrenched camp, &s;hould march out with their arms, the baggage of the officers and &s;oldiers, and all the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;aries of war; e&s;corted by a detachment of French troops, or interpreters at|tached to the &s;avages. It was agreed, that the gate of the fort &s;hould be delivered to the troops of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, immediately after &s;igning the capitulation; and the retrenched camp, on the de|parture of the Briti&s;h forces: that the artillery, warlike &s;tores, provi&s;ion, and in general every thing, except the effects of the &s;oldiers and officers, &s;hould, upon honour, be delivered to the French troops; for which purpo&s;e it was agreed there &s;hould be delivered, with the capitulation, an exact inventory of the &s;tores, and other particulars &s;pe|cified: that the garri&s;on of the &s;ort, the troops in the retrenchment, and dependencies, &s;hould not &s;erve for the &s;pace of eighteen months, from the date of the capitulation, again&s;t his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, or his allies: that with the capitulation there &s;hould be delivered an exact &s;tate of the troops, &s;pecifying the names of the officers, engi|neers, artilleri&s;ts, commi&s;&s;aries, and all employed: that the officers and &s;oldiers, Canadians, women, and &s;avages, made pri&s;oners by land &s;ince the com|mencement of the war in North America, be deli|vered

<P>Whether the marquis de Montcalm was really a&s;&s;iduous to have the&s;e articles punctually executed, we cannot pretend to determine; but certain it is, that they were perfidiou&s;ly broke, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance. The &s;avages, in the French intere&s;t, either paid no regard to the capitulation, or were permitted from views of policy, to act the mo&s;t preacherous, inhuman, and in&s;idious part. They fell upon the Briti&s;h troops as they marched out, de&s;poiled them of the few remaining effects, dragged the Indians in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice out of their ranks, &s;calping, tomahawking, and again act|ing the tragedy at O&s;wego, with a thou&s;and addi|tional outrages and barbarities. The throats of

Can po&s;terity be brought to believe, that two thou&s;and Britons, with arms in their hands, could be &s;ame &s;pectators of the&s;e and more &s;hocking barbarities? That they would permit a rabble of bruti&s;h &s;avages to &s;eize infants and children by the heels, and wantonly beat out their brains again&s;t trees and &s;tones! Yet were the&s;e and other enormities, equally di&s;graceful to humanity, committed in &s;ight of the French and Briti&s;h forces, if we may credit the te&s;timony of credible evidences. However, the greate&s;t part of the Briti&s;h garri&s;on got &s;afe, though in a mi&s;erable condition, to Fort Edward, after being pur&s;ued for &s;even miles by the Indians; and the re&s;t, flying for protection to the marquis de Montcalm, were by him &s;ent home. A little time after the enemy de|moli&s;hed the fort, carried off the effects, provi&s;ion, artillery, and every thing el&s;e left by the garri&s;on, together with the ve&s;&s;els pre&s;erved in the lake, and departed, without pur&s;uing their &s;ucce&s;s by any other attempt.</P>

What the object of this cruize might have been, can only be conjectured. Some imagine curio&s;ity was the admiral's &s;ole motive, and the de&s;ire of informing <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>We could not, without interrupting the principal ope|rations, take notice of two oc|currences which ought to have been mentioned.</P>
<P>In the month of July a &s;tra|tagem, contrived by the ene|my, had very nearly occa&s;ion|ed the lo&s;s of Fort John&s;on. They propo&s;ed ru&s;hing into the fort in the evening, when the gate was opened to admit the Negroe women, &s;ent out every day to milk the cattle. Happening to be a few mi|nutes too late, the gates were fortunately &s;hut before their arrival; upon which they knocked for admi&s;&s;ion, were challenged, and fired upon by the centinel. Immediately the cannon was fired to alarm the country, and the enemy, per|ceiving their &s;cheme baffled, retired with precipitation.</P>
<P>The other occurrence we mentioned is of a civil nature. The governor and council of Nova Scotia, taking into con|&s;ideration the mo&s;t expedient methods for carrying into exe|cution tho&s;e parts of his ma|je&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;truc|tions, relative to the manner of holding the general a&s;&s;em|bly of that province, came to a re&s;olution, that a hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the province &s;hall con&s;titute the legi&s;lature of Nova Scotia, in conjunction with his maje&s;ty's governor and commander in chief for the time being, and his maje&s;ty's council of the &s;aid province.

Be this as it may, the Briti&s;h &s;quadron appeared off Loui&s;bourg on the twentieth day of Augu&s;t; and approaching within two miles of the batteries, &s;aw the French admiral make the &s;ignal to unmoor. Mr. Hol|bourn was greatly inferior in &s;trength; and it is obvious, that his de&s;ign was not to fight the ene|my, as he immediately made the be&s;t of his way to Hallifax. About the middle of September, being reinforced with four &s;hips of the line, he again proceeded to Loui&s;bourg, probably with intention, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw the enemy to an engagement; but he found de la Mothe too prudent to hazard an unnece&s;&s;ary battle, the lo&s;s of which would have greatly expo&s;ed all the French colonies. Here the Engli&s;h &s;quadron continued cruizing until the twenty-fifth, when they were overtaken in a ter|rible &s;torm from the &s;outhward. When the hur|ricane began, the fleet was about forty leagues di&s;tant from Loui&s;bourg; but were driven in twelves hours within two miles of the rocks and breakers on that coa&s;t.

Faction in the mother country, produced divi&s;ions and mi&s;conduct in the colonies. No ambition to &s;ignalize them&s;elves appeared among the officers, from the uncertain|ty whether their &s;ervices were to be rewarded or condemned. Their attachment to particular per&s;ons weakened the love they ought to have en|tertained for their country in general, and de&s;troyed that &s;pirit of enterprize, that firmne&s;s and re&s;olu|tion, which con&s;titutes the commander, and with|out which the be&s;t capacity, joined to the mo&s;t un|corruptible integrity, can effect nothing.</P>

Clive, on the other &s;ide, inve&s;ted the town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and made the attack with that vigour and intre|pidity peculiar to him&s;elf, which greatly contri|buted to the &s;udden reduction of the &s;ettlement. As &s;oon as the &s;ort was &s;urrendered, the brave and ac|tive captain Coote, with his maje&s;ty's troops, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and found ninety-one pieces of cannon, four mortars, abundance of ammunition, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions, with every requi&s;ite for &s;u&s;taining an ob&s;tinate &s;iege. Thus the Engli&s;h were re|e&s;tabli&s;hed in the two &s;tronge&s;t fotre&s;&s;es in the Ganges, with the incon&s;iderable lo&s;s of nine &s;ea|men killed, and three &s;oldiers. A few days after, Hughly, a city of great trade, &s;ituated higher up the river, was reduced with as little difficulty, but infinitely greater prejudice to the nabob, as here his &s;tore-hou&s;es of &s;alt, and va&s;t granaries for the &s;upport of his army, were burnt and de&s;troyed. Incen&s;ed at the almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous lo&s;s of all his conque&s;ts, and demolition of the city of Hughly, the viceroy of Bengal a&s;&s;embled an army of ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and fifteen thou&s;and foot, fully re|&s;olved to expel the Engli&s;h out of his dominions, and take ample vengeance for the di&s;graces he had lately &s;u&s;tained. He was &s;een marching by the Engli&s;h camp in his way to Calcutta on the &s;econd of February, where he encamped, about a mile from the town. Colonel Clive immediately made application to the admiral for a reinforcement; and &s;ix hundred men, under the command of cap|tain Warwick, were accordingly draughted from the different &s;hips, and &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t his little army.

Though this advantage was le&s;s deci&s;ive than could be wi&s;hed, yet did it &s;ufficient|ly intimate the Nabob into conc&s;&s;ions much to the honour and advantage of the company. He promi&s;ed not to di&s;turb the Engli&s;h in any of tho&s;e privileges or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;pecified in the phirmand granted by the Mogul: that all merchandize belonging to the company &s;hould pa&s;s and repa&s;s in every part of the province of Bengal, free of duty: that all the Engli&s;h factories &s;eized the pre|ceding year, or &s;ince, would be re&s;tored, with the money, goods, and effects appertaining; that all damages &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h &s;hould be re|paired, and their lo&s;&s;es repaid: that the Engli&s;h &s;hould have liberty to fortify Calcutta, in whatever manner they thought proper, without interrup|tion: that they &s;hould have the liberty of coming all the gold and bullion they imported, which &s;hould pa&s;s current in the province: that he would remain in &s;trict friend&s;hip and alliance with the Engli&s;h, u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to heal up the late divi&s;ions, and re&s;tore the former good under|&s;tanding between them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9.</NOTE> Such were the terms obtained for the company by the &s;pirited and gallant conduct of the two Eng|li&s;h commanders. They had, however, too much di&s;cernment to rely on the promi&s;es of a barbarian, who had &s;o perfidiou&s;ly broke former engage|ments;

but they prudently di&s;&s;embled their &s;enti|ments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> until they had thoroughly rein&s;tated the af|fairs of the company, and reduced the French power in this province. The chief object of their de&s;igns was the reduction of Chandenagore, a French &s;ettlement, higher up the river than Cal|cutta, of con&s;iderable &s;trength, and the chief in importance of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that nation in the bay. Colonel Clive, being reinforced by three hundred men from Bombay, began his march to Chandenagore, at the head of &s;even hundred Eu|ropeans and one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Indians, where, on his fir&s;t arrival, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the out-po&s;ts, except one redoubt mounted with<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 1$&punc;</NOTE> eight pieces of cannon, which he left to be &s;ilenced by the admiral. On the eighteenth of March the admirals Wat&s;on and Pocock arrived within two miles of the French &s;ettlement, with the Kent, Tiger, and Sali&s;bury men of war; and found their pa&s;&s;age ob&s;tructed by booms laid acro&s;s the river, and &s;everal ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in the channel. The&s;e dif|ficulties being removed, they advanced early on the twenty fourth, and drew up in a line before the fort which they battered with great fury for three hours; while colonel Clive was making his approaches on the land &s;ide, and playing vigorou&s;ly from the batteries he had rai&s;ed. Their united efforts &s;oon obliged the enemy to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. A flag of truce was waved over the walls, and the place &s;urrendered by capitulation. The keys were delivered to captain Latham of the Tiger, and in the afternoon colonel Clive with the king's troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus the reduction of a &s;trong fortre&s;s, garri&s;oned by five hundred Europeans, and
<PB N="50" REF="530">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> one thou&s;and two hundred Indians, defended by one hundred and twenty-three pieces of cannon, and three mortars, well provided with all kinds of &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries, and of very great importance to the enemy's commerce in India, was accom|pli&s;hed with a lo&s;s not exceeding forty men on the &s;ide of the conquerors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">March 24.</NOTE> By the treaty of capitulation the director, coun|&s;ellors, and inferior &s;ervants of the &s;ettlement, were allowed to depart with their wearing apparel: the Je&s;uits were permitted to take away their church-ornaments, and the natives to remain in the full exertion of their liberties; but the garri&s;on were to continue pri&s;oners of war. The goods and mo|ney found in the place were con&s;iderable; but the principal advantage aro&s;e from the ruin of the head &s;ettlement of the enemy on the Ganges, which could not but interfere with the Engli&s;h commerce in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s had hitherto attended all the operations of the Briti&s;h commanders, becau&s;e they were con|certed with fore&s;ight and unanimity; and exe|cuted with that vigour and &s;pirit which have de|&s;ervedly rai&s;ed them high in the e&s;teem of their country. They reduced the Nabob to rea&s;onable terms of accommodation, before they alarmed the French; and now, when the power of the latter was de&s;troyed, they entered upon mea&s;ures to oblige the treacherous viceroy to a &s;trict perform|ance of the treaty he had &s;o lately &s;igned. How|ever &s;pecious his promi&s;es were, they found him extremely dilatory in the execution of &s;everal ar|ticles of the treaty, which, in effect, was the &s;ame to the Engli&s;h commerce as if none had been con|cluded.

The company's goods were loaded with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> high duties, and &s;everal other infractions of the peace committed, upon &s;uch frivolous pretences as evidently demon&s;trated, that he &s;ought to come to an open rupture as &s;oon as his projects were ripe for execution. As recommencing ho&s;tilities again&s;t &s;o powerful a prince was in it&s;elf dangerous, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided, the affair was laid before the council of Calcutta, and canva&s;&s;ed with all the circum&s;pection and caution that a mea&s;ure re|quired, on which depended the fate of the whole trade of Bengal. During the&s;e deliberations a mo&s;t fortunate incident occurred, that &s;oon deter|mined the council to come to an open rupture. The leading per&s;ons in the viceroy's court found them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed by his haughtine&s;s and in&s;o|lence. The &s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;content appeared among the principal officers of his army: they were well acquainted with his perfidy, &s;aw his prepara|tions for war, and were &s;en&s;ible that the peace of the country could never be re&s;tored, unle&s;s either the Engli&s;h were expelled, or the Nabob depo&s;ed. In con&s;equence a plan was concerted for dive&s;ting him of all his power; and the con&s;piracy was con|ducted by Jaffier Ali Khan, his prime mini&s;ter and chief commander, a nobleman of great influence and authority in the province. The project was commu|nicated by Ali Khan to Mr. Watts, &s;econd in council at Calcutta, and &s;o improved by the addre&s;s of that gentleman as in a manner to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. When the plan was fully concerted between the di&s;affected Indians and the council, colonel Clive was ordered to take the field with his little army. Admiral Wat&s;on undertook the defence of Chan|denagore,
<PB N="52" REF="550">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and the garri&s;on was detached to rein|force the colonel, together with fifty &s;eamen, to be employed as gunners, and in directing the ar|tillery. On the nineteenth of June a detachment was &s;ent to attack Cutwa fort and town, &s;ituated on that branch of the river forming the i&s;land Ca&s;|&s;imbuzar. This place &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;um|mons; and here the colonel halted with the army for three days, expecting advices from Ali Khan. Di&s;appointed of the hoped for intelligence, he cro&s;&s;ed the river on the twenty-&s;econd; and the &s;ame day attacked the viceroy at the head of twenty-thou&s;and men with his own forces only, Ali Khan declining as yet to declare him&s;elf openly. After a &s;hort conte&s;t the enemy were put to flight, the Nabob's camp, baggage, and fifty pieces of can|non taken, and a mo&s;t complete victory obtained. The colonel, pur&s;uing his advantage, marched to Muxadavat, the capital of the province, and was there joined by Ali Khan and the mal-contents. It was before concerted, that this nobleman &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the dignity of Nabob: accord|ingly the colonel proceeded &s;olemnly to depo&s;e the Sulajud Dowla, and, with the &s;ame ceremony, to &s;ub&s;titute Ali Khan in his room, who was publickly acknowledged by the people as &s;uba, or viceroy of the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orixa. Soon after the late viceroy was taken, and put to death by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who readily complied with all the conditions of his elevation. He conferred on his allies &s;uch liberal rewards, and granted the company &s;o extraordinary privileges, as fully de|mon&s;trated how ju&s;tly he merited their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By this alliance, and the reduction of Chandena|gore,

the French were entirely excluded the com|merce<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> of Bengal and its dependencies; the trade of the Engli&s;h company was re&s;tored, and en|crea&s;ed beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes; a new ally was acquired, who&s;e intere&s;t obliged him to remain firm to his engagements; above two mil|lions &s;terling paid to the company and the &s;ufferers at Calcutta, to indemnify their lo&s;&s;es; the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen gratified with the &s;um of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, as a reward for the courage and intrepidity they exerted; and a variety of other advantages gained, which it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate. In a word, in the &s;pace of fourteen days a great revolution was effected, and the go|vernment of a va&s;t country, &s;uperior in wealth, fer|tility, extent, and number of inhabitants, to mo&s;t European kingdoms, transferred by a handful of troops, conducted by an officer untutored in the art of war, and a general rather by intuition than in&s;truction and experience. But the public joy at the&s;e &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es was, however, con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the death of admiral Wat&s;on, and the lo&s;s of Vizagapatam, an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement on the Coromandel coa&s;t. The admiral fell a victim to the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the climate on the &s;ix|teenth of Augu&s;t, univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and re|gretted; and the factory and fort at Vizagapatam were &s;urrendered to the French, a few days after colonel Clive had defeated the Nobob.</P>

Sufficient it is, that, after &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments that human nature could invent, or man &s;upport, his judges thought proper to terminate his mi&s;ery by a death &s;hocking to ima|gination, and &s;hameful to humanity On the twenty eighth day of March he was conducted, amid&s;t a va&s;t concour&s;e of the populace, to the Greve, the common place of execution, &s;tripped naked, and fa&s;tened to the &s;ca$$old by iron gyves. One of his hands was then burnt in liquid flaming &s;ulphur; his thighs, legs, and arms torn with red|hot pincers; boiling oil, melted lead, ro$in, and &s;ulphur, were poured into the wounds; tight liga|tures tied round his limbs, to prepare him for di&s;|memberment; young and vigorous hor&s;es applied to the draught, and the unhappy criminal pulled with all their force to the utmo&s;t exten&s;ion of his &s;inews for the &s;pace of an hour, during all which time he pre&s;erved his &s;en&s;es and con&s;tancy. At length the phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, attending, de|clared it would be impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h the di&s;|memberment, unle&s;s the tendons were &s;eparated: upon which orders were given to the executioner to cut the &s;inews at the joints of the arms and legs. The hor&s;es drew afre&s;h: a thigh, and arm were &s;eparated, and, after &s;everal pulls, the unfor|tunate culprit expired under the extremity of pain. His body and limbs were reduced to a&s;hes under the &s;caffold; his father, wife, daughter and family, bani&s;hed the kingdom for ever; the name of Da|mien

<P>Thus ended the cruel procedure again&s;t Damien and his family, in a manner not very favourable to the avowed clemency of Lewis, or the acknow|ledged humanity of the French nation. It ap|peared, from undoubted evidence, and inconte&s;t|able proofs, that the attempt on the king's life was the re&s;ult of in&s;anity, and a di&s;turbed imagina|tion. Several in&s;tances of a di&s;ordered mind had before been ob&s;erved, and the dete&s;tation ju&s;tly due to the enormity of his crime ought now to have been ab&s;orbed in the con&s;ideration of his misfor|tune, the greate&s;t that can befal human nature. He was, in fact, rather an object of the deepe&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, than of tho&s;e infernal tortures; in ap|plying which they &s;eemed to forget that he was a fellow creature, labouring under an infirmity dread|ful in it&s;elf, unavoidable, and that might po&s;&s;ibly be the lot of any among his puni&s;hers.</P>
<P>Another remarkable event in France, in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change in the French mini&s;try.</NOTE> beginning of this year, was the change in the mi|ni&s;try of that nation, by the removal of M. de Machault, keeper of the &s;eals, from the po&s;t of &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the marine; and of M. d'Ar|gen&s;on from that of &s;ecretary at war <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>They were both di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments on the third of February, but with very different marks of the royal di&s;plea&s;ure, by the fol|lowing letters from the king.</P>

The fatal effects of this accident had been apprehended long before the thaw hap|pened, and every po&s;&s;ible precaution had been taken to guard again&s;t them: but the calamities which en&s;ued, exceeded all that were fore&s;een. The rich province of Artois, in particular, &s;uffered mo&s;t &s;everely. The rivers every where &s;welled with &s;uch incredible rapidity, that men, women, and children were carried away by the violence of the torrent: the valleys were immediately over|flowed: roads, hou&s;es, churches, bridges, mills, all mingled in one promi&s;cuous ruin. Cattle of all kinds without number peri&s;hed, and the corn fields were torn up and ruined: in &s;hort, nothing was able to re&s;i&s;t this dreadful inundation, attended with the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences to the unhappy pea&s;ant.</P>

This formidable army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine early in the &s;pring, and marched by We&s;tphalia, in order to invade the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions, in quality of allies to the Empre&s;s|queen, and guardians of the liberties of the Empire, and with no other intention, as was pretended; but in reality with a view to reduce Hanover al&s;o; the French judging, that the &s;ame blow by which they hoped to cru&s;h the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, might likewi&s;e force his Britannic maje&s;ty into &s;ome con|ce&s;&s;ions with regard to America. The other army of the French, commanded by the prince de Sou|bi&s;e, was de&s;tined to &s;trengthen the Imperial army of execution, con&s;i&s;ting al&s;o of twenty five thou|&s;and men, be&s;ides &s;ix thou&s;and Bavarians, and four thou&s;and Wirtembergers.

The&s;e articles were as follow:</P>
<P N="1">"I. The army of the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, $word$ all &s;urrender to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia pri&s;oners of war.&mdash;An|&s;wer. If the king will give me that army, 'tis needle&s;s to make them pri&s;oners of war.</P>

<P N="6">VI.

No general &s;hall be forced to &s;erve again&s;t his will: that's &s;ufficient."</P>
<P>The other articles were nei|ther particularly remarkable, not characteri&s;tic of the gene|rals who &s;igned them: where|fore we &s;hall only add, that the Saxon troops, after being incorporated with tho&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia, either di&s;liking the &s;everity of the Pru&s;&s;ian di&s;|cipline, which they had not been u&s;ed to, or from a de&s;ire of rejoining their lawful &s;ove|reign, de&s;erted in great num|bers. Among others, a whole regiment being ordered to Berlin, to keep garri&s;on there during the war, whil&s;t upon their march went off in a bo|dy, and fled into Poland by the way of Cro&s;&s;en, from whence they were followed by a battalion of another Saxon regiment, which was there in garri&s;on: upon which his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty broke all the other Saxon regiments he had taken, and &s;eparated them into &s;uch &s;mall divi&s;ions, as to have no rea&s;on to apprehend their com|bination, nor to dread their being remi&s;s in their duty.</P>
<P>When the queen of Poland was informed of the&s;e de&s;er|tions, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;ap|probation in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, &s;ore&s;eeing that her country would be obliged to furni&s;h other troops in their &s;tead; and accordingly the magi&s;trates were ordered to rai&s;e &s;peedily four thou&s;and fre&s;h recruits.</P></NOTE>, as was ob&s;erved before, retired into win|ter-quarters until the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould permit him to improve the&s;e advantages.

In con&s;equence of the&s;e requi&s;itions, the Czarina, true to her engagements, di&s;patched an hundred and thirty thou&s;and of her troops, who began their march in the month of November, and proceeded to the borders of Lithuania, with de&s;ign particu|larly to invade the Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, whil&s;t a &s;trong fleet was equipped in the Baltic to aid the opera|tions of this numerous army.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian army, a&s;&s;embled in Bohemia, amounted to upwards of a hundred thou&s;and men, commanded by prince Charles of Lorrain and mare|chal Brown. The Swedes had not yet openly de|clared them&s;elves; but it was well known, that tho' their king was allied in blood and inclination to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, yet the jealou&s;y which the &s;enate of Sweden entertained of their &s;overeign, and the hope of recovering their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in Pomerania, by means of the pre&s;ent trou|bles, together with their old attachment to France, newly cemented by intrigues and &s;ub&s;idies, would certainly induce them to join in the general con|federacy. The Duke of Mecklenbourg took the &s;ame party, and agreed to join the Swedi&s;h army, when it &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled with &s;ix thou&s;and men. Be&s;ides all the&s;e preparations again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, he was, in his quality of elector of Brandenbourgh, put under the ban of the Em|pire by the aulic council; declared deprived of all his rights, privileges, and prerogatives; his fiefs e&s;cheated into the exchequer of the Em|pire; and all the circles accordingly ordered to

<P>In this dangerous &s;ituation, thus menaced on all &s;ides, and &s;eemingly on the very brink of inevitable de&s;truction, the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch owed his pre&s;erva|tion to tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing abilities which will render him the admiration of all future ages. The Ru&s;&s;ians knowing that the country they were to pa&s;s through in their way to Lithuania, would not be able to feed their prodigious numbers, had taken care to furni&s;h them&s;elves with provi&s;ions for their march thither, depending upon the re&s;ources they ex|pected to find in Lithuania after their arrival there. The&s;e provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted by the time they reached the borders of that province, where they found them&s;elves &s;uddenly and unexpectedly de|&s;titute of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, either to return back or to proceed forward: the king of Pru&s;&s;ia having, with<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|gre&s;s of the Ru&s;|&s;ians &s;topt.</NOTE> great prudence and fore&s;ight, &s;ecured plenty to him&s;elf, and di&s;tre&s;s and famine to his enemies, by buying up all the corn and forage of the coun|try which the&s;e la&s;t were entering<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the rea&s;on which has hitherto been publicly a&s;|&s;igned for the &s;udden halt of the Ru&s;&s;ians: but that this ex|traordinary event mu&s;t have had &s;ome other more &s;ecret cau&s;e, is evident from the di&s;|grace of the great chancellor, count Be&s;tucheff, which en|&s;ued &s;oon after.</NOTE>. However, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty, to guard as much as could be again&s;t every<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strict at|tention of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</NOTE> po&s;&s;ible event, &s;ent a great number of gunners and matro&s;&s;es from Pomerania to Memel, with three regiments of his troops, to reinforce the garri&s;on of that place.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the head-quarters of an enemy to that country, i&s; enjoyed the utmo&s;t quiet; the Pru&s;&s;ian troops be|having with the greate&s;t regularity, and the king him&s;elf immediately redre&s;&s;ing, in per&s;on, every grievance, of which the lea&s;t complaint was made <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among many in&s;tances of his particular attention, we &s;hall mention only the follow|ing. Ten of his life-guards being billeted upon a burgher of Dre&s;den, were placed in the third &s;tory, which they re&s;ent|ed, telling the man, that at Pot&s;dam they were always lodged in the fir&s;t floor; and threatened to turn him out of his apartment, and take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it for them&s;elves. The burgher immediately pre&s;ented a &s;tate of the ca&s;e, in writing, to the king; who, in five mi|nutes, returned it with this an&s;wer, written with his own hand: "Pot&s;dam is not Dre&s;|den; Dre&s;den is not Pot&s;dam: my troops mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with a third &s;tory, where bet|ter accommodations are not to be had."</NOTE>. Leaving nothing to others but the exe|cution of his commands, he examined every thing in per&s;on. In &s;ix days, he vi&s;ited all the po&s;ts which his troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Sile&s;ia, gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for their &s;ecurity, and went to Nei&s;s, where he &s;ettled with marechal Schwe|rin the general plan of the operations of the ap|proaching campaign; and particularly, that the marechal's army in Sile&s;ia, which con&s;i&s;ted of fifty thou&s;and men, was to have in con&s;tant view the motions of the royal army, by which its own were to be regulated, that they might both act in concert, as circum&s;tances &s;hould require. At the &s;ame time, other armies were a&s;&s;embled by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in Lu&s;atia and Voightland; twenty thou&s;and men were collected at Zwickaw, on the frontiers of Bohemia, towards Egra, un|der the command of prince Maurice of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au; and &s;ixty thou&s;and cho&s;en troops began
<PB N="65" REF="680">
their march towards Great Zhidlitz, where their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757,</NOTE> head-quarters were &s;ettled. In the mean while, the Au&s;trian troops began to form on the frontiers of Saxony, where &s;ome of their detachments appeared, to watch the motions of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who &s;till continued to pur&s;ue their operations with great ac|tivity and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>All po&s;&s;ible care was taken by the Pru&s;&s;ians at Dre&s;den to &s;ecure a retreat, in ca&s;e of a defeat. As only one regiment of Pru&s;&s;ians could be &s;pared to remain there in garri&s;on, the burghers were di&s;armed, their arms depo&s;ited in the ar&s;enal, and a detachment was po&s;ted at Konig&s;tein, to oblige that fortre&s;s to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality. All cor|re&s;pondence with the enemy was &s;trictly prohibited; and it having been di&s;covered that the counte&s;s of Ogilvie, one of the queen's maids of honour, had di&s;obeyed his maje&s;ty's commands, &s;he was arre&s;ted; but, on the queen's interce&s;&s;ion, afterwards re|lea&s;ed. The counte&s;s of Bruhl, lady of the Saxon prime mini&s;ter, was al&s;o arre&s;ted by his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty's order; and, on her making light of her confinement, and re&s;olving to &s;ee company, &s;he was ordered to quit the court, and retire from Saxony. M. Henwin, the French mini&s;ter, was told that his pre&s;ence was unnece&s;&s;ary at Dre&s;den&punc; and on his replying that his ma&s;ter had com|manded him to &s;tay, he was again de&s;ired to de|part; on which he thought proper to obey. The count de Waekerbath, mini&s;ter of the cabinet, and grand ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold to the prince royal of Poland, was arre&s;ted, and conducted to Cu&s;trin, by the expre&s;s command of his maje&s;ty. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, having thrown two bridges

The circles of Mi&s;nia and Leip&s;ic were enjoined to furni&s;h four hundred each, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skir|mithes between the Pru&s;|&s;ian, and Au&s;trians on the frontiers of Bohe|mia.</NOTE> the other circles in proportion.</P>
<P>While the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was taking the&s;e mea|&s;ures in Saxony, two &s;kirmi&s;hes happened on the frontiers of Bohemia, between his troops and the Au&s;trians. On the twentieth of February, a body of &s;ix thou&s;and Au&s;trians &s;urrounded the little town of H$r&s;chfeld in Upper Lu&s;atia, gar|ri&s;oned by a battalian of Pru&s;&s;ian foot. The fir&s;t attack was made at four in the morning on two re|doubts without the gates, each of which was de|fended with two field-pieces: and though the Au&s;trians were &s;everal times repul&s;ed, they at la&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of one of the redoubts&punc; and carried off the two pieces of cannon. In their retreat they were pur&s;ued by the Pru&s;&s;ians, who fell upon their rear, killed &s;ome, and took many pri&s;oners: this affair co&s;t the Au&s;trians at lea&s;t five hundred men. About a fortnight after, the prince of Bevern marched out of Zittau, with a body of near nine thou&s;and men, in order to de&s;troy the remaining &s;trong holds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trians on the frontiers. In this expedition he took the Au&s;|trian magazine at Friedland in Bohemia, con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and &s;acks of meal, and great &s;tore of ammunition; and, after making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Reichenberg, he returned to Zittau. The van of his troops, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and fifty hu&s;|&s;ars of the regiment of Putkammer, met a body of &s;ix hundred Creats, &s;u&s;tained by two hundred

The Pru&s;&s;ians, it is &s;aid, did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle man on this occa&s;ion; and two &s;oldiers only were &s;lightly wounded, the Au&s;|trians having made but a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

The left wing of the Au&s;trians, thus &s;ituated, was guarded by the mountains of Zi&s;cka, and the right extended as far as Herboli, Prince Charles of Lorrain and marechal Brown, who commanded them, &s;eemed determined to maintain this advantageous po&s;t: but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e vivacity overlooked all difficul|ties, having thrown &s;everal bridges over the Moldaw on the fifth of May, pa&s;&s;ed that river in the morning of the &s;ixth, with thirty thou|&s;and men, leaving the re&s;t of the army under the command of the prince of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au: and being immediately joined by the troops under ma|rechal Schwerin and the prince of Bevern, re|&s;olved to attack the enemy on the &s;ame day. In con|&s;equence of this re&s;olution, his army filed off on the left by Pot&s;chernitz, in order to execute this de&s;ign; and at the &s;ame time count Brown wheel|ed to the right, to avoid being flanked.

The foot began the attack too pre|cipitately, and were at fir&s;t repul&s;ed; but they &s;oon recovered them&s;elves. While the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia took the enemy in flank, marechal Schwerin advanced to a mar&s;hy ground, which &s;uddenly &s;topping his army, threatened to di&s;concert the whole plan of operation: upon this, he immedi|ately di&s;mounted, and taking the &s;tandard of the regiment in his hand, boldly entered the mora&s;s, crying out, "Let all brave Pru&s;&s;ians follow me."</P>

Thus fell marechal Schwerin, loaded with years and glory; an officer who&s;e fidelity, intre|pidity, experience, and military prudence, had de&s;ervedly gained him the friend&s;hip and confi|dence of his royal ma&s;ter.

The left wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians then marched$ immediately towards Micheley, and being there joined by the hor&s;e,

In the mean time, the troops on the right of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, attacked the remains of the left wing of the Au&s;|trians, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of three bat|teries. But the behaviour of the infantry in the la&s;t attack was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as to leave little room for this part of the cavalry to act. Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the prince of Bevern, performed wonders, making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of two batte|ries; and prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wic took the left wing of the Au&s;trians in flank, while the king with his left, and a body of cavalry, &s;ecured the pa&s;&s;age of the Moldaw. In &s;hort, after a very long and ob&s;tinate engagement, and many &s;ignal examples of valour on both &s;ides, the Au&s;trians were forced to abandon the field of battle, leaving behind &s;ixty pieces of cannon, all their tents, baggage, military che&s;t, and, in a word, their whole camp. The weight of the battle fell upon the right wing of the Au&s;trians; the remains of whom, to the amount of ten or twelve thou&s;and men, fled towards Bene&s;chau, where they after|wards a&s;&s;embled under M. Pretlach, general of hor&s;e. The infantry retired towards Plague, and threw them&s;elves into that city, with their com|manders, prince Charles of Lorrain and marechal Brown; but they were much harra&s;&s;ed in their re|treat, by a detachment of the I ru&s;&s;ians under ma|rechal Keith. The Pru&s;&s;ians took, on this occa|&s;ion, ten &s;tandards, and upwards of four thou|&s;and pri&s;oners, thirty of whom were officers of rank. Their lo&s;s amounted to about two thou|&s;and five hundred killed, and about three thou&s;and

Al|ready<NOTE PLACE="marg">The be|&s;ieged make a vigorous &s;ally;</NOTE> they had &s;allied out, and taken &s;ome other ineffectual &s;teps to recover this po&s;t; but a more deci&s;ive &s;troke was nece&s;&s;ary. Accordingly a de|&s;ign was formed of attacking the Pru&s;&s;ian army in the night with a body of twelve thou&s;and men, to be &s;u&s;tained by all the grenadiers, volunteers, Pan|dours, and Hungarian infantry, in ca&s;e an impre&s;|&s;ion could be made on the king's lines. It was intended to open a way &s;word in hand, through the camp of the be&s;iegers, and to ea&s;e Prague of the multitude of forces locked up u&s;ele&s;s within the walls, &s;erving only to con&s;ume the provi&s;ions of the garri&s;on, and hurry on a &s;urrender. Hap|pily a de&s;erter gave the prince of Pru&s;&s;ia intelli|gence of the enemy's de&s;ign, about eleven o'clock at night. Proper mea&s;ures were immediately taken for their reception, and in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour the whole army was under arms.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign was conducted with &s;o much &s;ilence, that, though the Pru&s;&s;ians were warned of it, they could di&s;cover nothing before the enemy had charged their advanced po&s;ts. The attack was be|gun on the &s;ide of the little town, again&s;t mare|chal Keith's camp, and the left wing of the Pru&s;|&s;ian army encamped on the Moldaw. From hence it is probable the Au&s;trians propo&s;ed not only to de&s;troy the batteries that were rai&s;ing, but to at|tack
<PB N="82" REF="850">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> the bridges of communication which the Pru&s;|&s;ians threw over the Moldaw, at about a quarter of a German mile above and below Prague, at Branick and Podbaba.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t alarm began about two o'clock, when the enemy hoped to have come &s;ilently and unexpectedly upon the miners; but they had left work about a quarter of an hour before. At the report of the fir&s;t piece which they fired, the piquet of the third battalion of Pru&s;&s;ian guards, to the number of an hundred men, who went out of the camp to &s;u&s;tain the body which covered the works, was thrown into &s;ome confu&s;ion, from the dark|ne&s;s of the night, which prevented their di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the Au&s;trian troops from their own. Lieutenant Jork, detached with two platoons to re|connoitre the enemy, attempting to di&s;cover their di&s;po&s;ition by kindling a fire, Captain Rodig, by the light of this fire, perceiving the enemy's &s;itua|tion, immediately formed the de&s;ign of falling upon them in flank, and gave orders to his men to fire in platoons, which they performed, mu|tually<NOTE PLACE="marg">but are repul&s;ed.</NOTE> repeating the &s;ignal given by their com|mander. The enemy fled with the greater preci|pitation, as they were ignorant of the weakne&s;s of the piquet, and as the &s;houting of the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers made them mi&s;take it for a numerous body. Many of them de&s;erted, many took &s;helter in Prague, and many more were driven into the river, and drowned.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time this attack began, a regi|ment of hor&s;e-grenadiers fell upon a redoubt which the Pru&s;&s;ians had thrown up, &s;upported by the Hungarian infantry: they returned three times
<PB N="83" REF="860">
to the a&s;&s;ault, and were as often beat back by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Pru&s;&s;ians, whom they found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;|lodge; though prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick's battalion, which guarded this po&s;t, &s;uffered ex|tremely. While the attack was making, the enemy kept an ince&s;&s;ant fire with their mu&s;quetry upon the whole front of the Pru&s;&s;ians, from the convent of St. Margaret to the river.</P>
<P>At three in the morning the Pru&s;&s;ians quitted their camp, to engage the enemy. The battalion of Pannewitz attacked a building called the Red|hou&s;e, &s;ituated at the bottom of a declivity before Wel$a&s;towitz. The Pandours, who had taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this hou&s;e, fired upon them ince&s;&s;antly from all the doors and windows, until they were di&s;|lodged; and the Pru&s;&s;ian battalions were obliged to &s;u&s;tain the fire, both of cannon and mu&s;quetry, for above two hours, when the enemy retired to the city, except the Pandours, who again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Redhou&s;e, which the Pru&s;&s;ians were forced to abandon, becau&s;e the artillery of Prague kept a continual fire upon it from the mo|ment it was known to be in their hands. The Au&s;trians left behind them many dead and wound|ed, be&s;ides de&s;erters; and the Pru&s;&s;ians, notwith|&s;tanding the lo&s;s of &s;everal officers and private men, made &s;ome pri&s;oners. Prince Ferdinand, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's younge&s;t brother, had a hor&s;e killed under him, and was &s;lightly wounded in the face.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian works being completed, and hea|vy artillery arrived, four batteries, erected on the banks of the Moldaw, began to play with great fury. Near three hundred bombs, be&s;ides an in|&s;inity
<PB N="84" REF="870">

The &s;cene was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prague bombard|ed.</NOTE> lamentable; hou&s;es, men, and hor&s;es wrapped in flames, and reduced to a&s;hes. The confu&s;ion within, together with the want of proper artillery and ammunition, obliged the Au&s;trians to cea&s;e firing, and furni&s;hed his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty with all the opportunity he could wi&s;h of pouring de&s;truc|tion upon this unfortunate city. The horrors of war &s;eemed to have extingui&s;hed the principles of humanity. No regard was paid to the di&s;tre&s;s of the inhabitants: the Au&s;trians ob&s;tinately main|tained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Pru&s;&s;ians practi&s;ed every &s;tratagem, every barbarous refinement, that con|&s;titutes the military art, to oblige them to capitu|late. After the conflagration had la&s;ted three days, and con&s;umed a prodigious number of buildings, the principal inhabitants, burghers, and clergy, perceiving their city on the point of being reduced to a heap of rubbi&s;h, or laid wholly in a&s;hes, be|&s;ought the commander, in a body, to hearken to terms; but he was deaf to the voice of pity, and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brave de|fence of the be|&s;ieged.</NOTE> in&s;tead of being moved with their &s;upplications, drove out twelve thou&s;and per&s;ons, the lea&s;t u&s;eful in defending the city. The&s;e, by order of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, were again forced back; which &s;oon produced &s;o great a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion with|in the walls, that the Au&s;trians were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of eating hor&s;e-fle&s;h, forty hor&s;es being daily di&s;tributed to the troops, and the &s;ame food &s;old at four pence a pound to the inhabitants. However, as there &s;till remained great abundance of corn, they were far from being brought to the la&s;t extremity. Two vigorous and well conducted

<P>Whatever difficulties might attend the conque&s;t of Prague, certain it is, that the affairs of the Em|pre&s;s queen were in the mo&s;t critical and de&s;perate &s;ituation. Her grand army di&s;per&s;ed in parties, and flying for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in &s;mall corps; their princes and commanders cooped up in Prague; that capi|tal in imminent danger of being taken; the flou|ri&s;hing kingdom of Bohemia ready to fall into the hands of the conqueror; a con&s;iderable army on the point of &s;urrendering pri&s;oners of war; all the queen's hereditary dominions open and expo&s;ed; the whole fertile tract of country from Egra to the Moldaw, in the actual po&s;&s;es;&s;ion of the Pru&s;&s;ians; the di&s;tance to the archduchy of Au&s;tria not very con&s;iderable, and &s;ecured only by the Danube; Vi|enna under the utmo&s;t apprehen&s;ions of a &s;iege, and the Imperial family ready to take refuge in Hungary; the Pru&s;&s;ian forces deemed invincible, and the &s;anguine friends of that monarch already &s;haring with him, in imagination, the &s;poils of the ancient and illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Such was the a&s;pect of affairs, and &s;uch the difficulties to be combated, when Leopold, count Daun, was ap|pointed to the command of the Au&s;trian forces, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Count Daun takes the command of the Au&s;trian army,</NOTE> &s;tem the torrent of di&s;grace, and turn the fortune of the war.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> now, for the fir&s;t time, rai&s;ed to act in chief, at the head of an army, on which depended the fate of Au&s;tria, and the empire. Born of a noble<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of that general.</NOTE> family, he re$$ed &s;olely upon his own merit: $span$ &s;oliciting court favour, he a&s;pired after the $word$ preferment, and &s;ucceeded by mere dint of &s;upe|rior worth. His progre&s;s from the &s;tation of a $u|baltern was &s;low and $$ient: his promotion to the chief command was received with univer&s;al e&s;teem and applau&s;e. Cautious, $ready, penetrating, and &s;agacious, he was oppo&s;ed as another Fabius to the modern Hannioal, to check the fire and vigour of that monarch, by &s;low prudence and phlegmatic circum$pect$on. Arriving at Boemitchbrod, within a few miles of Prague, the day after the late defeat, he halted to collect the $word$ corps and broken remains of the Au&s;trian army, and &s;oon drew toge|ther a force to con&s;iderable, as to attract the notice of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, who detached the prince of Bevern with twenty battalions and thirty &s;quadrons, to attack him before numbers &s;hould render him formidable. Daun was too prudent to give battle with di&s;pirited &s;hattered troops, &s;unk with di&s;grace, to an army flu&s;hed with victory. He retired on the fir&s;t advice that the Pru&s;&s;ians were advancing, and took po&s;t at Kolin, where he entrenched him&s;elf &s;trongly, opened the way for the daily &s;upply of re|cruits &s;ent to his army, and in&s;pired the garri&s;on of Prague with fre&s;h courage, in expectation of being &s;oon relieved. Here he kept clo&s;e within his camp, divided the Pru&s;&s;ian forces, by obliging the king to employ near half his army in watching his de&s;igns, weakened his efforts again&s;t Prague, harra&s;&s;ed the enemy by cutting off their convoys,

and re&s;tored, by degrees, the langui&s;hing and al|mo&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> de&s;ponding &s;pirits of his troops. Perfectly acquainted with the ardor and di&s;cipline of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops, with the enterpri&s;ing and impetu|ous di&s;po&s;ition of that monarch, and &s;en&s;ible that his &s;ituation would prove irk&s;ome and embarra&s;&s;ing to the enemy, he improved it to the be&s;t advantage, &s;eemed to fore&s;ee all the con&s;equences, and directed every mea&s;ure to produce them. Thus he retarded the enemy's operations, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly avoided precipitating an action, until the Pru&s;&s;ian vigour &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, their &s;trength impaired by lo&s;&s;es and de&s;ertion, the fir&s;t fire and ardor of their genius extingui&s;hed by continual fatigue and ince&s;&s;ant alarms, and the impre&s;&s;ion made on his own men, by the late defeat, in &s;ome degree effaced. The event ju&s;tified Daun's conduct. His army grew every day more numerous, while his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty began to expre&s;s the utmo&s;t impatience at the length of the &s;iege. When that monarch fir&s;t inve&s;ted Prague, it was on the pre&s;umption that the numerous forces within the walls would, by con&s;uming all the provi&s;ion, oblige it to &s;urrender in a few days; but perceiving that the Au&s;trians had &s;till a con&s;iderable quantity of corn; that count Daun's army was daily encrea&s;ing, and would &s;oon be powerful enough, not only to cope with the de|tachment under the prince of Bevern, but in a con|dition to rai&s;e the &s;iege, he determined to give the count battle with one part of his army, while he kept Prague blocked up with the other. The Au&s;trians amounted now to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, were deeply entrenched, and defended by a fine and prodigious train of artillery, placed on redoubts and batteries
<PB N="88" REF="910">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> erected on the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;ts. Every acce&s;&s;ible part of the camp was fortified with lines and heavy pieces of battering cannon, and the foot of the hills &s;ecured by difficult defiles. Yet &s;trong as this &s;ituation might appear, formidable as the Au&s;trian forces certainly were, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty undertook to di&s;lodge them with a body of hor&s;e and foot, not exceeding thirty-two thou&s;and men. On the thirteenth day of June he quitted the camp before Prague, e&s;corted by a few battalions and &s;quadrons, with which he joined the prince of Be|vern at Milkowitz. Marechal Keith, it is &s;aid, &s;tre|nuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure, and advi&s;ed either rai&s;ing the &s;iege entirely, and attacking the Au&s;trians with the united forces of Pru&s;&s;ia, or po&s;tponing the attack on the camp at Kolin, until his maje&s;ty &s;hould either gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, or &s;ome attempts &s;hould be made to oblige him to quit his po&s;ts. From either mea&s;ure an advantage would re&s;ult. With his whole army he might probably have defeated count Daun, or at lea&s;t have obliged him to retreat. Had he continued within his lines at Prague, the Au&s;trian general could not have con&s;trained him to rai&s;e the &s;iege, without lo&s;ing his own advantageous &s;ituation, and giving battle upon terms nearly equal. But the king, elated with &s;ucce&s;s, impetuous in his valour, and confident of the &s;uperiority of his own troops in point of di&s;|cipline, thought all re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t &s;ink under the weight of his victorious arm, and yield to that cou|rage<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Pru&s;&s;ia advances again&s;t him.</NOTE> w hich had already &s;urmounted &s;uch difficulties, di&s;regarded the marechal's &s;age coun&s;el, and marched up to the attack undaunted, and even a&s;&s;ured of &s;uc|ce&s;s. By the eighteenth the two armies were in

&s;ight; and his maje&s;ty found that count Daun had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> not only fortified his camp with all the heavy can|non of Olmutz, but was &s;trongly reinforced with troops from Moravia and Au&s;tria, which had joined him &s;ub&s;equent to the king's departure from Prague. He found the Au&s;trians drawn up in three lines upon the high grounds between Genlitz and St. John the Bapti&s;t. Difficult as it was to approach their &s;ituation, the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry marched up<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bat|tle of Ko|lin, or Kaurzim.</NOTE> with firmne&s;s, while &s;hot was poured like hail from the enemy's batteries, and began the attack about three in the afternoon. They drove the Au&s;trians with irre&s;i&s;tible intrepidity from two eminences &s;ecured with heavy cannon, and two villages defended by &s;everal battalions; but, in attacking the third eminence, were flanked by the Au&s;trian cavalry, by grape-&s;hot poured from the batteries; and, after a violent con|flict, and prodigious lo&s;s of men, put into di&s;|order.</P>
<P>Animated with the king's pre&s;ence, they ral|lied, and returned with double ardour to the charge; but were a &s;econd time repul&s;ed. For &s;even times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively did prince Ferdinand renew the attack, performing every duty of a great ge|neral and valiant &s;oldier, tho' always with the &s;ame fortune. The inferiority of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry, the di&s;advantages of ground, where the cavalry could not act, the advantageous &s;ituation of the enemy, their numerous artillery, their entrenchments, num|bers, and ob&s;tinacy, joined to the &s;kill and conduct of their general, all con&s;pired to defeat the hopes of the Pru&s;&s;ians, to &s;urmount their valour, and oblige them to retreat. The king then made a la&s;t and
<PB N="90" REF="930">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> furious effort, at the head of the cavalry, on the enemy's left wing; but with as little &s;ucce&s;s as all the former attacks. Every effort was made, and every attempt was productive only of greater lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes. At la&s;t, after expo&s;ing his per|&s;on in the mo&s;t perilous &s;ituations, after perform|ing all that could be expected from valour tutored by conduct, and a &s;oul in&s;pired with that noble ar|dour which braves dangers, gra&s;ps at victory, and &s;purns difficulty, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty drew off his<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pru&s;|&s;ians de|feated.</NOTE> forces from the field of battle, retiring in &s;uch good order, in &s;ight of the enemy, as prevented a pur&s;uit, or the lo&s;s of his artillery and baggage. Al|mo&s;t all the officers on either &s;ide di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves; and count Daun, who&s;e conduct emu|lated that of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, received two &s;light wounds, and had a hor&s;e killed under him. The lo&s;&s;es of both armies were very con&s;iderable: on that of the Pru&s;&s;ians, the killed and wounded amounted to eight thou&s;and; le&s;s pernicious, how|ever, to his maje&s;ty's cau&s;e than the frequent de|&s;ertions, and other innumerable ill con&s;equences that en&s;ued.</P>
<P>When the Pru&s;&s;ian army arrived at Nimburg, his maje&s;ty, leaving the command with the prince of Bevern, took fre&s;h hor&s;es, and e&s;corted by twelve or fourteen hu&s;&s;ars, &s;et out for Prague, where he arrived next morning without halting, after having been the whole preceding day on hor&s;eback, and leading every attack. Immediately he gave orders<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;iege of Prague rai&s;ed.</NOTE> for &s;ending off all his artillery, ammunition, and baggage; which was executed with &s;o much expe|dition, that the tents were &s;truck, and the army on

<P>Thus terminated the battle of Kolin and &s;iege of Prague, in which the acknowledged errors of his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty were more than ballanced by the intrepidity of his conduct, and the candour with which he owned his mi&s;take, both in a letter to the Earl Marechal <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"The Imperial grena|diers, &s;ays he, are an admira|ble corps: one hundred compa|nies defended a ri&s;ing ground, which my be&s;t infantry could not carry.

A body of twenty or thirty thou&s;and men would have blocked up Prague, while the remainder of the Pru&s;&s;ian forces might have obliged the imperial family to retire from Vienna, and effectually pre|vented count Daun from a&s;&s;embling another army. It was univer&s;ally expected he would have bent his march &s;trait to this capital; but he dreaded leaving the numerous army in Prague behind; and it was of great importance to complete the con|que&s;t of Bohemia. With re&s;pect to the attack at Kolin, his maje&s;ty him&s;elf has generou&s;ly given up that mea&s;ure; and to this alone, perhaps, are we to attribute the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes, and the du|ration of the war.

However, the&s;e contingents were furni&s;hed very &s;lowly, and with manife&s;t reluctance; and it was &s;till &s;up|po&s;ed that many of the princes of the Empire would declare them&s;elves neutral, as the elec|tor of Bavaria had already ex|pre&s;ly done: and to induce them the more readily &s;o to do, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ent a body of his troops, under co|lonel Meyer, into Franconia, where they advanced as far as Nuremberg, and threatened to rai&s;e contributions upon all &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e to de|clare them&s;elves neutral.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the French mini&s;ter had al&s;o, on the twentieth of April, pre&s;ent|ed to the dyet a declaration, dated the twentieth of March, wherein his ma&s;ter gave his rea&s;ons for &s;ending his armies into the Empire; and among other things, &s;et forth, That, in order to prevent the war from &s;preading in the Em|pire, he had &s;acrificed his de|&s;ire of a ju&s;t revenge, and con|&s;ented that the empre&s;s queen &s;hould make an offer of a con|vention of neutrality, in his name, for the dominions which the king of England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in Germany. And, by way of &s;upplement to this declaration, the Empre&s;s-queen communicated to &s;e|veral courts, with whom &s;he was in friend&s;hip, the condi|tions that were propo&s;ed for bringing about a neutrality in favour of the electorate of Ha|nover. According to the overtures made on this head, the king of Great Britain in his electoral capacity, would have been con&s;idered as having no concern in the pre&s;ent war. His troops, and tho&s;e of the princes allied to him, were not to act again&s;t the troops of the Empre&s;s-queen and her al|lies. He was likewi&s;e to en|gage not to &s;uccour the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, either with men or money. The pa&s;&s;age through that part of his electorate which is &s;ituated on the left of the river Aller, was to be granted to the troops of her Imperial maje&s;ty and her allies paying for what provi&s;ions, fo|rage, and waggons, they &s;hould want in the country: be&s;ides which they were to be allowed to e&s;tabli&s;h magazines and ho&s;|pitals in certain parts of the electorate. The town of Ha|melen was to be put into the hands of the Empre&s;s, or one of her allies, as a depo&s;it; or into the hands of the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, or of the king of Denmark, who were propo&s;ed as guarantees of the conven|tion. Moreover, they were to make a repartition of quar|ters for the Hanoverian troops, who&s;e number, by this con|vention, was not to be aug|mented.</P></NOTE>. The declaration, or manife&s;to, which his maje&s;ty cau&s;ed to be publi&s;hed on this occa&s;ion was as follows:</P>

<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible for the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and impar|tial, after con&s;idering the conduct of his Britannic maje&s;ty on this occa&s;ion, not to &s;ee the inju&s;tice of all the motives and pretences of France for invad|ing the electoral territories of Brun&s;wick, which are under the protection of the empire.</P>
<P>"If the&s;e pretences are founded upon the war which has broke out between England and France, it is ea&s;y to &s;how, that this war, both with re&s;pect to its cau&s;es and its ends, is entirely foreign to his maje&s;ty, as elector, and to his German dominions.</P>
<P>"As to the &s;econd war which has been kindled in Germany, the crown of France, as guarantee of the treaty of We&s;tphalia, has not the lea&s;t pretence, on one hand, to act again&s;t the &s;tates before-men|tioned, &s;o long as his maje&s;ty cannot be charged with any breach of the &s;aid peace; and, on the other, France, as an ally and auxiliary of the Em|pre&s;s-queen, cannot ju&s;tly act again&s;t a member of the Empire, who is not at war, nor has the lea&s;t difference with her Imperial maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>"To prevent the ill con&s;equence of fal&s;e and art|ful in&s;inuations, his maje&s;ty has thought it highly requi&s;ite thus to declare to the whole world, that he is very far from having conceived any de&s;ign to act offen&s;ively again&s;t any of the &s;tates of the Em|pire, or even again&s;t the crown of France; and that by the armament, and the march of his troops, to which he has been compelled, he has no view or de&s;ire but to repre&s;s, by the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, all inva&s;ion, violence, and ho&s;tilities; and if &s;uch &s;hould happen, to do, as a principal and original member of the Empire, what &s;hall be ju&s;t in the &s;ight of God and man, and what he owes to the &s;afety of the coun|try which the Almighty has entru&s;ted to his care.</P>

Thither the generals, appointed to com|mand the &s;everal divi&s;ions, repaired, to &s;ettle the plan of operations with their commander the duke of Cumberland, who, having left London on the ninth of April, arrived on the &s;ixteenth at Hano|ver, and from thence repaired to the army, which, having been joined by three Pru&s;&s;ian regiments that retired from We&s;el, con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-&s;even batta|lions and thirty-four &s;quadrons. Of the&s;e, &s;ix batta|lions and &s;ix &s;quadrons were po&s;ted at Bielefeldt, un|der the command of lieutenant-general baron de Sporcken; &s;ix battalions under lieutenant-general de Block, at Hervorden; &s;ix battalions and four &s;quadrons, under major-general Ledebour, between Hervord and Minden; &s;even battalions and ten &s;quadrons, under lieutenant-general d'Oberg, in the neighbourhood of Hamelen; and five batta|lions and four &s;quadrons, under major-general de Hau&s;s, near Nienburg.

<P>In the mean time the French on the Lowe Rhine continued filing off ince&s;&s;antly. The &s;ieg$ of Gueldres was converted into a blockade, occa+&s;ioned by the difficulties the enemy found i$ rai&s;ing batteries; and a party of Hanoverians

On the other hand, colonel Fi&s;cher having had an engagement with a &s;mall body of Hanoverians, in the county of Teklenburgh, routed them, and made &s;ome pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>After &s;everal other little &s;kirmi&s;hes between the French and the Hanoverians, the duke of Cum|berland altered the po&s;ition of his camp, by placing it between Bielefeldt and Hervorden, in hopes of fru&s;trating the de&s;ign of the enemy; who, declin|ing to attack him on the &s;ide of Bracwede, after having reconnoitred his &s;ituation &s;everal days, made a motion on their left, as if they meant to get be|tween him and the We&s;er. This was no &s;ooner done than, on the thirteenth of June in the after|noon, having received advice that the enemy had cau&s;ed a large body of troops, followed by a &s;econd, to march on his right to Burghotte, he ordered his army to march that evening towards Hervor|den; and at the &s;ame time major-general Harden|berg marched with four battalions of grenadiers, and a regiment of hor&s;e, to reinforce that po&s;t. Count Schulenberg covered the left of the march with a battalion of grenadiers, a regiment of hor&s;e, and the light troops of Buckleburg. The whole army marched in two columns. The right, com|po&s;ed of hor&s;e, and followed by two battalions, to cover their pa&s;&s;age through the inclo&s;ures and de|files, pa&s;&s;ed by the right of Bielefeldt: and the left, con&s;i&s;ting of infantry, marched by the left of the &s;ame town.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> The van-guard of the French army attacked the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skir|mi$hes with the French.</NOTE> rear-guard of the allies, commanded by major-general Ein&s;iedel, very bri&s;kly, and at fir&s;t put them into &s;ome confu&s;ion; but they immediately recovered them&s;elves. This was in the beginning of the night. At break of day the enemy's rein|forcements returned to the charge, but were again repul&s;ed; nor could they once break through lieu|tenant-colonel Alfeldt's Hanoverian guards, which clo&s;ed the army's march with a detachmenent of re|gular troops, and a new rai&s;ed corps of hunters.</P>
<P>The allies encamped at Cofeldt the fourteenth, and &s;taid there the next day, when the enemy's detachments advanced to the gates of Hervorden, and made a feint as if they would attack the town, after having &s;ummoned it: but they retired with|out attempting any thing farther; and, in the mean time, the troops that were po&s;ted at Hervorden, and formed the rear-guard, pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er on the &s;ide of Remen, without any mole&s;tation, and encamped at Holtzuy&s;en. A body of troops which had been left at Bielefeldt, to cover the duke's re|treat, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the French, re|joined the army in the environs of Herfort; and a few days after his royal highne&s;s drew near his bridges on the We&s;er, and &s;ent over his artillery, baggage, and ammunition. At the &s;ame time &s;ome detachments pa&s;&s;ed the river on the right,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duke of Cum|berland pa&s;&s;es the $word$.</NOTE> between Minden and Oldendorp, and marked out a new camp, advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, having the We&s;er in front, and the right and left covered with eminences and mar&s;hes. There the army under his royal highne&s;s rea&s;&s;embled; and the French fixed their head-quarters at Bielefeldt, which the

<P>By this time the French were in &s;uch want of forage, particularly hay, that M. d'Etr&eacute;es him&s;elf, the princes of the blood, and all the officers, with|out exception, were obliged to &s;end back part of their hor&s;es, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t tho&s;e that remained. However, on the tenth of June their whole army, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy battalions and forty &s;qua|drons, with fifty-two pieces of cannon, be&s;ides a body of cavalry left at Ruremonde for the conve|niency of forage, was put in motion; and, in &s;pite of almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able fore&s;ts, famine, and every other ob&s;tacle that could be thrown in their way by a vigilant and experienced general, at length &s;urmounted all difficulties, and advanced into a country abounding with plenty, and unu&s;ed to the ravages of war.</P>
<P>It was imagined, that the pa&s;&s;age of the We&s;er, which defends Hanover from foreign attacks, would have been vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the army of the allies: but whether, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, it was thought advi&s;eable to act only upon the defen&s;ive, and not to begin the attack in a country that was not concerned as a principal in the war: or whether the duke of Cumberland found him&s;elf too weak to make head again&s;t the enemy, is a que&s;tion we &s;hall not pretend to deter|mine. However that may have been, the whole French army pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er on the tenth and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French follow him.</NOTE> eleventh of July, without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle man.

Between &s;even and eight the firing of &s;mall arms began on the left of the allies, when his royal highne&s;s ordered major-general Behr, with three battalions of Brun&s;wick, to &s;u&s;tain the grenadiers in the wood, if their a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be wanted. The cannonading continued above &s;ix hours, during which, the troops that were expo&s;ed to it never once abated of their firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The fire of the &s;mall arms on the left increa&s;ed, and the French &s;eemed to gain ground; whereupon his royal highne&s;s detached the colonels Darken|hau&s;en and Bredenbach with three Hanoverian bat|talions and &s;ix &s;quadrons round the wood by Af|ferde, who, towards the clo&s;e of the day, drove &s;e|veral &s;quadrons of the enemy back to their army, without giving them any opportunity to charge.

But the French being in po&s;&s;es;&s;ion of an eminence, which commanded and flanked both the lines of the in|fantry and the battery of the allies, and where they were able to &s;upport their attack under the cover of a hill, his royal highne&s;s con&s;idering the &s;uperior numbers of the enemy, near double to his, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of di&s;lodging them from their po&s;t, without expo&s;ing his own troops too much, order|ed a retreat; in con&s;equence of which his army re|tired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The allied retreat.</NOTE> fir&s;t to Hamelen, where he left a garri&s;on, then to Nienburg, and afterwards to Hoya; in the neighbourhood of which town, after &s;ending away all the magazines, &s;ick and wounded, he encamp|ed, in order to cover Bremen and Verden, and to pre&s;erve a communication with Stade, to which place the archives, and mo&s;t valuable effects of Hanover had been removed.</P>

<P>"Foreigners never were con&s;trained to &s;ettle in this country; nor was any oppo&s;i|tion ever made to their with|drawing, when they de&s;ired it: even the migration duties, paid in other countries, have not been demanded of them.

<P>The action began at five in the morning, and was carried on with &s;o much vigour, that the Pru&s;|&s;ians intirely broke the whole fir&s;t line of the ene|my, and forced all their batteries.

General Lapuchin was wounded, and taken pri&s;oner, with a colonel of the Ru&s;&s;ian artillery; but the former was &s;ent back on his pa|role. The Pru&s;&s;ian army had, at fir&s;t, made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of above eighty pieces of cannon; but were afterwards obliged to abandon them, with eleven of their own, for want of carriages. Three Ru&s;&s;ian generals were killed; but the Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t no general or officer of di&s;tinction, of which rank count Dohna was the only one that was wounded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha&s;ty re|treat of the Ru&s;|&s;ians out of Pru&s;&s;ia.</NOTE> After this engagement, marechal Lehwald changed the po&s;ition of his army, by drawing towards Peter&s;wald; and the Ru&s;&s;ians, after re|maining quite inactive till the thirteenth of Sep|tember, on a &s;udden, to the great &s;urprize of every one, retreated out of Pru&s;&s;ia, with &s;uch precipita|tion, that they left all their &s;ick and wounded be|hind them, to the amount of fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; together with eighty pieces of can|non, and a con&s;iderable part of their military &s;tores. Marechal Apraxin ma&s;ked his de&s;ign, by advancing all his irregulars towards the Pru&s;&s;ian army; &s;o that marechal Lehwald was not informed of it till the third day, when he detached prince George of Hol&s;tein with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e to pur&s;ue them; but with little hopes of coming up with them, as they made forced marches, in order to be the &s;ooner in their own country. However, the Pru&s;|&s;ians took &s;everal of them pri&s;oners; and many &s;tragglers were killed by the country people in their flight towards Til&s;it, which they abandoned; though they &s;till kept Memel, and &s;hortly after

They made their retreat in two columns, one of which directed its cour&s;e towards Memel; wh$l&s;t the other took the neare&s;t way through the bailiwic of Ab&s;ternen, and threw bridges over the river Jura. Both co|lumns burnt every village they pa&s;&s;ed through, without di&s;tinction.

<P>The next morning, at break of day, the king found the Au&s;trians encamped with their right at the river Wei&s;le: the re&s;t of their army extended along a ri&s;ing-ground, at the foot of a mountain covered with wood, which protected their left; and before their front, at the bottom of the hill, on which they were drawn up, was a &s;mall brook, pa&s;&s;able only in three places, and for no more than four or five men a brea&s;t. Towards the left of their army was an opening, where three or four battalions might have marched in front: but be|hind it they had placed three lines of infantry; and on a hill which flanked this opening, within mu&s;ket&punc;&s;hot, were placed four thou&s;and foot, with forty or fifty pieces of cannon; &s;o that, in reality, this was the &s;tronge&s;t part of their camp.</P>
<P>The king left nothing undone to bring the Au&s;|trians to a battle; but finding them ab&s;olutely bent on avoiding it, after lying four days before them, he and his army returned to their camp at Bern&s;tedel.

<P>After this action his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty advanced near Ey&s;enach, with a de&s;ign to attack the com|bined army: but they were &s;o &s;trongly intrenched, that he found it impracticable; and his provi&s;ions falling &s;hort, he was obliged to retire towards Er|furth, and &s;oon after to Naumburg on the river Sala; whereupon the combined army marched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">but po&s;|&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of it again.</NOTE> and again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gotha, Erfurth, and Weimar; which la&s;t place, however, they &s;oon after quitted.</P>

The Swedes had actually taken &s;ome towns in Pomera|nia, and were advancing to be&s;iege Stetin; and the Au&s;trians, who had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Lignitz, and a con&s;iderable part of Sile&s;ia, had now laid &s;iege to Schweidnitz, and were preparing to pa&s;s the Oder, in order to attack the prince of Bevern in his camp near Bre&s;lau.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leipzig &s;ubjected to milita|ry execu|tion by the Pru&s;|&s;ians.</NOTE> On the other hand, the unfortunate inhabitants of Leipzig now felt, mo&s;t &s;everely, the cruel effects of the power of their new ma&s;ter. The Pru&s;&s;ian commandant in that city had, by order of his king, demanded of them three hundred thou&s;and crowns; a &s;um far greater than it was in their power to rai&s;e. This truth they repre&s;ented; but in vain. The &s;hort time allowed them to furni&s;h their con|tingents being expired, and all their efforts to comply with this demand having proved ineffec|tual, they were &s;ubjected to the rigours of military execution; in con&s;equence of which their hou&s;es were occupied by the &s;oldiery, who &s;eized upon the be&s;t apartments, and lived at di&s;cretion; but the &s;um demanded could not be found. Such was the &s;ituation of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed city, when, on the fif|teenth of October, an expre&s;s arrived, with advice that his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty would &s;oon be there; and accordingly he arrived a few minutes after, attend|ed by his life-guards. At the &s;ame time a rumour was &s;pread, that the city would be delivered up to pillage, which threw the inhabitants into the ut|mo&s;t con&s;ternation. Their fears, however, in that re|&s;pect, were &s;oon abated by his maje&s;ty's declaring, that he was willing to &s;pare the place, upon condi|tion that half the &s;um required &s;hould be imme|diately paid. All that could be done was to col|lect,
<PB N="146" REF="1500">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> among the merchants, traders, and others, fifty thou&s;and crowns; bills of exchange were drawn upon Am&s;terdam and London for &s;eventy thou&s;and crowns, and ho&s;tages were given, by way of &s;ecurity, for the payment of thirty thou&s;and more within a time which was agreed on. But &s;till, notwith&s;tanding this, the military execution was continued, even with greater rigour than be|fore; and all the comfort the wretched inhabitants could obtain, was, that it &s;hould cea&s;e whenever advice &s;hould be received that their bills were ac|cepted.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had tried &s;everal times to bring the combined army under the princes Saxe-Hildbourghau&s;en and Soubi&s;e to an engagement upon fair ground; but finding them bent on de|clining it, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of their numbers, he had recour&s;e to one of tho&s;e &s;trokes in war, by which a general is better &s;een than by the gaining of a victory. He made a feint &s;oon after the beginning of October, as if he intended no|thing more than to &s;ecure his own dominions, and march his army into winter-quarters back to Ber|lin, leaving marechal Keith with only &s;even or eight thou&s;and men to defend Leipzig. Upon this the enemy took courage, pa&s;&s;ed the Sala, and having marched up to the city, &s;ummoned the marechal to &s;urrender; to which he an&s;wered, That the king, his ma&s;ter, had ordered him to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity, and he would obey his orders. The enemy then thought of be&s;ieging the city: but before they could prepare any one im|plement for that purpo&s;e, they were alarmed by the approach of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, judging that
<PB N="147" REF="1510">
his feint would probably induce them to take the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> &s;tep they did, had, by previous and private orders, collected together all his di&s;tant detachments, &s;ome of which were twenty leagues a&s;under, and was advancing, by long marches, to Leipzig; upon notice of which the enemy repa&s;&s;ed the Sala. The Pru&s;&s;ian army was rea&s;&s;embled on the twenty-&s;e|venth of October, and remained at Leipzig the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, when every body expected a battle would be fought in the plains of Lutzen. On the thirtieth the king drew nigh that place; and on the thirty-fir&s;t, in his way through Wei&s;&s;enfels and Mere&s;bourg, he made five hundred men pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bat|tle of Ro&s;|bach, in which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, with twenty thou&s;and men, de|feats &s;ix|ty-five thou&s;and French and Impe|riali&s;ts.</NOTE> The combined army had repa&s;&s;ed the Sala at Wei&s;&s;enfels, Mere&s;bourg, and Halle, where they broke down the bridges; but the&s;e were &s;oon re|paired, and the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army, amounting to no more than twenty thou&s;and men, having pa&s;|&s;ed that river through the&s;e towns, in each of which they left a battalion, joined again on the third of November in the evening over-again&s;t the enemy, who&s;e forces con&s;i&s;ted of forty thou&s;and French, and twenty-five thou&s;and Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The king was going to attack them on the fourth, but deferred it; and that whole day was &s;pent in a cannonade, which did no great damage to either &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the fifth, about nine o'clock in the morning, the Pru&s;&s;ians received intelligence that the enemy were every where in motion. They likewi&s;e heard their drums beating the march, and, &s;o near were the two armies to each other, plainly perceived from their camp, that their whole infantry, which
<PB N="148" REF="1520">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> had drawn nearer upon the ri&s;ing grounds, over again&s;t them, was filing off towards their right. No certain judgment could, however, yet be form|ed of the enemy's real de&s;ign; and as they were in want of bread, it was thought probable that they intended to repa&s;s the Un&s;trut: but it was &s;oon perceived, that their &s;everal motions were contradictory to each other. At the &s;ame time that &s;ome of their infantry was filing off towards their right, a large body of cavalry wheeled round towards their left, directing its march all along to the ri&s;ing grounds, with which the whole Pru&s;|&s;ian camp, that lay in a bottom between the vil|lages of Rederow and Ro&s;bach, was &s;urrounded, within the reach of large cannon. Soon after that cavalry was &s;een to halt, and afterwards to fall back to the right; though &s;ome of them &s;till remained where they were, whil&s;t the re&s;t marched back. About two in the afternoon the doubts of the Pru&s;&s;ians were cleared up: it plainly appeared then, that the enemy intended to attack them, and that their di&s;po&s;itions were made with a view to &s;ur|round them, and to open the action by attacking them in the rear. A body of re&s;erve was po&s;ted over-again&s;t Rederow, to fall upon their routed troops, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be defeated, and to pre|vent their retiring to Mer&s;eburgh, the only retreat which could then have been left them.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the king of Pru&s;&s;ia re&s;olved to attack them. His maje&s;ty had determined to make the attack with one wing only; and the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy made it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be the left wing. The very in&s;tant the battle was going to begin, his maje&s;ty ordered the general
<PB N="149" REF="1530">
who commanded the right wing, to decline enga|ging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> to take a proper po&s;ition in con&s;equence thereof, and, above all, to prevent his being &s;ur|rounded. All the cavalry of the right wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians, except two or three &s;quadrons, had already marched to the left, which was done at full gallop; and being arrived at the place a&s;&s;igned them, they formed over-again&s;t that of the enemy. They then moved on immediately; the enemies advanced to meet them, and the charge was very fierce, &s;everal regiments of the French coming on with great re&s;olution. The advantage, however, was entirely on the &s;ide of the Pru&s;&s;ians. The enemy's cavalry being routed, were pur&s;ued for a con&s;iderable time with great &s;pirit; but having af|terwards reached an eminence, which gave them an opportunity of rallying, the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry fell upon them afre&s;h, and gave them &s;o total a de|feat, that they fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. This happened at four in the afternoon. Whil&s;t the caval|ry of the Pru&s;&s;ians charged, their infantry opened. The enemy cannonaded them bri&s;kly during this interval, and did &s;ome execution; but the Pru&s;&s;ian artillery was not behind-hand with them. After this cannonading had continued on both &s;ides a full quarter of an hour, without the lea&s;t intermi&s;|&s;ion, the fire of the infantry began. The enemy could not &s;tand it, nor re&s;i&s;t the valour of the Pru&s;|&s;ian foot, who gallantly marched up to their batte|ries. The batteries were carried one after another, and the enemy were forced to give way, which they did in great confu&s;ion. As the left wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians advanced, their right changed its po&s;i|tion; and having &s;oon met with a &s;mall ri&s;ing
<PB N="150" REF="1540">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> ground, they availed them&s;elves of it, by planting it with &s;ixteen pieces of heavy artillery. The fire from thence was partly pointed at the enemy's right, to increa&s;e the di&s;order there, and took their left wing in front, which was exce&s;&s;ively galled thereby. At five the victory was decided, the can|nonading cea&s;ed, and the enemy fled on all &s;ides. They were pur&s;ued as long as there was any light to di&s;tingui&s;h them by; and it may be &s;aid, that night alone was the pre&s;ervation of this army, which had been &s;o formidable in the morning. They took the benefit of the darkne&s;s to hurry into Fry|burgh, and there to repa&s;s the Un&s;trut, which they did on the morning of the &s;ixth, after a whole night's march. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;et out early in the morning to pur&s;ue them with all his cavalry, &s;upported by four battalions of grenadiers, the infantry following them in two columns. The ene|my had pa&s;&s;ed the Un&s;trut at Fryburgh, when the Pru&s;&s;ians arrived on its banks; and as they had burnt the bridge, it became nece&s;&s;ary to make another, which, however, was &s;oon done. The ca|valry pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, but could not come up with the enemy till five in the evening, upon the hills of Ecker&s;berg. It was then too late to force them there; for which rea&s;on the king thought proper to canton his army in the neare&s;t villages, and to be &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s his hu&s;&s;ars had in taking near three hundred baggage-waggons, and every thing they contained. The whole lo&s;s of the Pru&s;|&s;ians, in this important engagement, did not exceed five hundred men killed and wounded. Among the former was general Meincke; and among the lat|ter prince Henry and general Seydelitz. The enemy
<PB N="151" REF="1550">
lo&s;t &s;ixty-four pieces of cannon, a great many &s;tan|dards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and colours, near three thou&s;and men killed on the field of battle, and upwards of eight thou|&s;and taken pri&s;oners, among whom were &s;everal generals, and other officers of di&s;tinction. Three hundred waggons were &s;ent to Leipzig, loaded with wounded French and Swi&s;s. Upon the ap|proach of the Pru&s;&s;ians towards Ecker&s;berg, the enemy retreated with great precipitation; and, after marching all night, arrived the next day at Erfurth, in the utmo&s;t want of every nece&s;&s;ary of life, not having had a mor&s;el of bread for two days, during which they had been obliged to live upon turnips, radi&s;hes, and other roots, which they dug out of the earth.</P>
<P>The French, under the duke of Richelieu, were preparing to go into winter quarters; b&udotb;t, upon the news of this defeat of the combined army, they again put them&s;elves in motion, and a large detachment of them advanced as far as Duder&s;tadt, to favour the retreat of their countrymen under the prince of Soubi&s;e, who, with great precipitan|cy, made the be&s;t of their way from Erfurth to the county of Hohen&s;tein, and from thence bent their march towards Halber&s;tadt. Of the remains of the Imperial army, which was now almo&s;t in|tirely di&s;per&s;ed, whole bodies de&s;erted, and went over to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;oon after this battle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty was thus &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the French and Imperiali&s;ts, the Au&s;trians, who had carefully avoided coming to an open en|gagement with him, gained ground a-pace in Sile|&s;ia. A detachment of their army, under the com|mand of count Nada&s;ti, had already inve&s;ted
<PB N="152" REF="1560">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Schweidnitz, and opened the trenches before it on the twenty-&s;ixth of October. The Pru&s;&s;ian garri|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au&s;|trians take Schweid|nitz.</NOTE> commanded by general de la Motte Fouquet, determined to defend the place as long as po&s;&s;ible; and accordingly on the thirtieth they made a &s;ally, in which they killed, wounded, and took pri&s;oners, eight hundred of the be&s;iegers, and did &s;ome da|mage to their works: but on the &s;ixth of Novem|ber the Au&s;trians began to cannonade the city fu|riou&s;ly, and on the eleventh made them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of the ramparts by a&s;&s;ault. The garri&s;on, however, having taken care, during the &s;iege, to throw up a &s;trong intrenchment in the market-place, retreated thither, and held out till the next day, when they &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>After the reduction of this place, general Na|da&s;ti, leaving in it a &s;ufficient garri&s;on, marched with the remainder of his troops, and joined the main army of the Au&s;trians, under the command of prince Charles of Lorrain and marechal Daun, who, whil&s;t he was bu&s;ied in the &s;iege of Schweid|nitz, had inve&s;ted Bre&s;lau on the left of the Oder; the prince of Bevern defending it on the right, where he was &s;trongly encamped, with his little army, under the cannon of the city.</P>
<P>The whole army of the Au&s;trians being now re|a&s;&s;embled; and intelligence having been brought, not only of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's late victory near Leipzig, but al&s;o that he was advancing to the relief of the prince of Bevern, it was re&s;olved imme|diately to attack the la&s;t in his intrenchments, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;lodge him. Accordingly, on the twenty-&s;econd of November, about nine in the
<PB N="153" REF="1570">
morning, the Au&s;trians began a mo&s;t furious di&s;|charge<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> of their cannon, forty of which were twenty-four pounders; and this continued without cea&s;ing till one, when it was &s;ucceeded by a &s;mart fire of their &s;mall arms, which la&s;ted till five in the even|ing. The Pru&s;&s;ians, with undaunted re&s;olution, &s;tood two of the mo&s;t violent attacks that were ever made; but at the third, overpowered with numbers, and a&s;&s;ailed on both &s;ides, they began to<NOTE PLACE="marg">defeat the prince of Bevern near Bre&s;|lau.</NOTE> lo&s;e ground, and were forced to retire from one intrenchment to another. In this extremity, night coming on, the Pru&s;&s;ian generals, fearing their in|trenchments would be intirely forced, and that they &s;hould then be totally defeated, thought pro|per to retreat. The prince of Bevern, with the greate&s;t part of the army, retired to an eminence on the banks of the Oder, whil&s;t the re&s;t of the troops threw them&s;elves into Bre&s;lau, which they might have defended, in all probability, till the king had come up to its relief. But, on the twenty-fourth, their commander in chief, the prince of Bevern, going to reconnoitre the enemy, with only a &s;ingle groom to attend him, fell in among a party of Croats, who took him pri&s;oner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told, that he mi&s;|took the&s;e Croats for Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars. But &s;ome of the cir|cum&s;tances of this my&s;terious affair were interpreted into a premeditated de&s;ign in the prince to be taken pri&s;oner. It cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed that a man of his rank, a prince, a commander in chief, &s;hould officiou&s;ly undertake the always dangerous ta&s;k of reconnoitring the enemy, with &s;o &s;light an attendance as only one man, and that but a groom, even if he had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee things with his own eyes. Some &s;ecret di&s;&s;atisfaction, hitherto un|known to us, may po&s;&s;ibly have been the cau&s;e of his taking this &s;tep; or, which &s;eems &s;till more probable, he might be a&s;hamed, or, per|haps, even afraid, to &s;ee the king his ma&s;ter, after having &s;o injudiciou&s;ly abandoned the defence of Bre&s;lau, by quitting his lines, which it is a&s;&s;erted, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty had &s;ent him expre&s;s orders not to quit, on any account what|ever; for that he would cer|tainly be with him by the fifth of December; in which we &s;hall find he kept his word.</NOTE>. His army
<PB N="154" REF="1580">

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">gains a great vic|tory over them;</NOTE> The action began by attacking a battery of forty pieces of large cannon, which covered the right wing of the enemy. The two battallions of guards, troops reckoned, by all who ever &s;aw them, the fine&s;t in the world, and the regiments of the mar|grave Charles and of Itzenplitz, marched up, amid&s;t a mo&s;t terrible fire, to the very mouths of the cannon, with their bayonets &s;crewed. In this attack the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;u&s;tained their greate&s;t lo&s;s, though the battery was carried as &s;oon almo&s;t as they could get up to it: after which the enemy's artillery, now turned again&s;t them&s;elves, played fu|riou&s;ly upon them with their own powder. From that in&s;tant the two wings and the center of the Pru&s;&s;ians continued to drive the enemy before them, advancing all the time with that &s;low and re|gular pace for which they have always been re|nowned, without ever halting or giving way.

It was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, in the beginning, for the Pru&s;|&s;ian cavalry to act, on account of the impediments of fallen trees, which the enemy had cut down and laid in the field of battle, to retard their ap|proach: but a mo&s;t judicious di&s;po&s;ition, which the king made, overcame that di&s;advantage. When he fir&s;t formed his army, he had placed four bat|talions behind the cavalry of his right&punc;wing, fore|&s;eeing that general Nada&s;ti, who was placed with a corps of re&s;erve on the enemy's left, de&s;igned to take him in flank. It happened, as he had fore|&s;een; this general's hor&s;e attacking the king's right wing with great fury: but he was received with &s;o &s;evere a fire from the four battalions, that he was obliged to retire in di&s;order. The enemy gave way on all &s;ides; and after having, by a quick retreat, got at &s;ome di&s;tance, recovered them&s;elves three times, animated by their officers, and by the &s;uperiority of their numbers. Every time they made a &s;tand, the Pru&s;&s;ians attacked them with re|doubled vigour, and with &s;ucce&s;s equal to their bravery. Towards night the enemy, &s;till retreat|ing, fell into di&s;order. Their two wings fled in confu&s;ion: one of them, clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the king, ran towards Bre&s;lau, and took &s;helter under the cannon of that city; the other, pur&s;ued by the greate&s;t part of the light cavalry, took their flight towards Canth and Schweidnitz. Six thou&s;and Au&s;trians fell in this engagement; and the Pru&s;|&s;ians, who had only five hundred men killed, and two thou&s;and three hundred wounded, made up|wards of twenty thou&s;and of the enemy pri&s;oners,

The con&s;e|quences that followed this victory declared its greatne&s;s. Future ages will read with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that the &s;ame prince, who, but a few months before, &s;eemed verging on inevitable ruin, merely by the dint of his own amazing abilities, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any friend whatever, with troops perpetually harra&s;&s;ed by long and painful marches, and by continual &s;kirmi&s;hes and battles; not only quite retrieved his affairs, which almo&s;t every one, except him&s;elf, thought pa&s;t redre&s;s; but, in the mid&s;t of winter, in countries where it was judged next to impo&s;&s;ible for any troops to keep the field at that &s;ea&s;on, conquered the united force of France and the Empire at Ro&s;bach on the fifth of November; and on the &s;ame day of the very next month, with a great part of the &s;ame army, was at Li&s;&s;a, where he again triumphed over all the powers of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing his advantage, he immediately inve&s;ted Bre&s;lau, and, within two days after this great vic|tory, every thing was in readine&s;s to be&s;iege it in form. His troops, flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, were at fir&s;t for &s;torming it; but their more prudent ge|neral, knowing the &s;trength of the garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of thirteen thou&s;and men, and con&s;idering both the fatigues which his own &s;oldiers had lately undergone, and the fatal con&s;e|quences that might en&s;ue, &s;hould they fail of &s;uc|ce&s;s in this attempt, ordered the approaches to be carried on in the u&s;ual form.

The garri&s;on, of which ten thou|&s;and bore arms, and between three and four thou|&s;and lay &s;ick or wounded, were made pri&s;oners of war. Fourteen of the&s;e pri&s;oners were officers of high rank. The military che&s;t, a va&s;t trea&s;ure, with eighty pieces of cannon, fell into the hands of the victors, who lo&s;t only about twenty men in their approaches. During the &s;iege, a magazine of powder was &s;et on fire by a bomb; which occa|&s;ioned great confu&s;ion among the be&s;ieged, and damaged one of their ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>The &s;trong fortre&s;s of Schweidnitz &s;till remained in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, defended by a garri&s;on &s;o nu|merous, that it might be compared to a &s;mall army; and whil&s;t that continued &s;o, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's victories in Sile&s;ia were of no deci&s;ive effect. For this rea&s;on, tho' it was now the dead of winter, and the &s;oldiers &s;tood in need of repo&s;e, his maje&s;ty re|&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to become ma&s;ter of that place<NOTE PLACE="marg">inve&s;ts Schweid|nitz.</NOTE> before the end of the year: but as a clo&s;e &s;iege was impracticable, a blockade was formed, as &s;trictly as the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on would permit. It was not, however, till the beginning of the en&s;uing cam|paign that this place was taken. The Pru&s;&s;ians opened their trenches before it on the third of April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-eight, and erected two large batteries, which kept a conti|nual fire upon the town. The artillery of the be|&s;iegers con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred pieces of can|non, of different dimen&s;ions, and eighty mortars; an amazing artillery, and &s;uch as we have never heard of in former campaigns.

<P>`The late demand made to your High Mightine&s;&s;es, of a pa&s;&s;age for a large train of warlike implements thro' &s;ome of the barrier towns, in order to be &s;ent to O&s;tend and Nieuport, could not fail to awaken the King's attention.

<P>`The King commands me, therefore, to recall to your High Mightine&s;&s;es the two-fold right you have acquired to keep the Au&s;trian Nether|lands under the government of the hou&s;e of Au&s;|tria; and that no other has a title to make the lea&s;t alteration therein, without the con&s;ent of your High Mightine&s;&s;es; unle&s;s the new allies have re|&s;olved to &s;et a&s;ide all prior treaties, and to di&s;po&s;e at plea&s;ure of every thing that may &s;uit their pri|vate intere&s;t.</P>
<P>`In the treaty between your High Mightine&s;&s;es and the crown of France, &s;igned at Utrecht on the eleventh of April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirteen, in the fifteenth article, are the&s;e words: "It is al&s;o agreed, that no province, fort, town, or city, of the &s;aid Netherlands, or of tho&s;e which

<P>`In the barrier-treaty the&s;e very &s;tipulations are repeated in the fir&s;t article: "His Imperial and Catholic maje&s;ty promi&s;es and engages, that no province, city, town, fortre&s;s, or territory of the &s;aid country, &s;hall be ceded, transferred, given, or devolve to the crown of France, or to any other but the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the German dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, either by donation, &s;ale, ex|change, marriage-contract, heritage, te&s;tamentary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, nor under any other pretext what&s;o|ever; &s;o that no province, town, fortre&s;s, or terri|tory of the &s;aid Netherlands &s;hall ever be &s;ubject to any other prince, but to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the &s;tates of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria alone, excepting what has been yielded by the pre&s;ent treaty to the &s;aid lords the States General."</P>
<P>`A bare reading of the&s;e two articles is &s;uffi|cient to evince all that I have ju&s;t repre&s;ented to your High Mightine&s;&s;es: and whatever pretext the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles may alledge, to cover the infraction of the&s;e treaties, the thing re|mains neverthele&s;s evident, whil&s;t the&s;e two courts are unable to prove, that the towns of O&s;tend and Nieuport are not actually in the power of France.

<P>`The King hath &s;o much confidence in the good &s;en&s;e, prudence, and friend&s;hip of your High Mightine&s;&s;es, that he makes not the lea&s;t doubt of your taking the mo&s;t efficacious mea&s;ures to clear up an affair of &s;uch importance; and of your being plea&s;ed, in concert with his maje&s;ty, to watch over the fate of a country, who&s;e &s;ituation and inde|pendence have, for more than a century, been re|garded as one of the principal &s;upports of your liberty and commerce.'</P>

Such a repre&s;en|tation could not fail of being agreeable to a prince, who, at this juncture, &s;tood in need of an extraor|dinary cordial.

At this particular juncture, the French general was di&s;po|&s;ed to abide by the original articles of the conven|tion, rather than draw upon him&s;elf the ho&s;tilities of an army which he knew to be brave, re&s;olute, and well appointed, and which he &s;aw at pre&s;ent ani|mated

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the Ha|noverian army.</NOTE> About the latter end of November the Hanove|rian army was wholly a&s;&s;embled at Stade, under the au&s;pices of prince Ferdinand, who re&s;olved, with|out delay, to drive the French from the electorate, whither they now began their march. Part of the enemy's rear, con&s;i&s;ting of two thou&s;and men, was in their march back to Zell, attacked in the bailiwic of Eb&s;torff, and entirely defeated by general Schuy|lenbourg; and, in a few days after this action, another happened upon the river Aller, between two con&s;iderable bodies of each army, in which the Hanoverians, commanded by general Za&s;trow, re|mained ma&s;ters of the field. The&s;e petty advan|tages &s;erved to encourage the allies, and put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lunenburg, Zell, and part of the Brun&s;wic dominions, which the enemy were obliged to abandon. The operations of prince Ferdinand, however, were retarded by the re&s;olution and ob&s;ti|nate per&s;everance of the French officer who com|manded the garri&s;on of Harbourg.

One cannot, without horror, reflect upon &s;uch brutal acts of inhumanity. The French troops have, on divers occa&s;ions, and in different parts of the em|pire, acted tragedies of the &s;ame nature, which are not ea&s;ily reconcileable to the character of a nation famed for &s;entiment and civility. The Hanove|rians having advanced within a league of Zell, the two armies began to cannonade each other; the French troops po&s;ted on the right of the Aller, burned their magazines and retired into the town, where they were &s;o &s;trongly intrenched, that prince Ferdinand could not attempt the river, the pa&s;&s;es of which were &s;trongly guarded by the enemy. At the &s;ame time his troops were expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips from the &s;everity of the weather; he therefore retreated to Ultzen and Lunenburg, where his army was put into winter-quarters, and executed &s;everal &s;mall enterprizes by detachment, while the French general fixed his head-quarters in the city of Hanover, his cantonments extending as far as Zell, in the neighbourhood of which ma|ny &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought by the out-par|ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ha|noverian mini&s;ter di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Vi|enna.</NOTE> with various &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

The chagrin occa&s;ioned at the court of Vienna by the Hanoverian army's having recour&s;e to their arms again, was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, allevi|ated by the certain tidings received from Peter&s;|burgh, that the Czarina had &s;igned her acce&s;&s;ion, in form, to the treaty between the courts of Vien|na, Ver&s;ailles and Stockholm. In clo&s;ing our ac|count of this year's tran&s;actions on the Continent, we may ob&s;erve, that on the &s;ixteenth day of No|vember, the queen of Poland died at Berlin of an apoplexy, &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by the &s;hock &s;he received on hearing that the French were total|ly defeated at Ro&s;bach. She was a lady of exem|plary virtue and piety, who&s;e con&s;titution had been broke by grief and anxiety conceived from the di&s;tre&s;s of her own family, as well as from the mi|&s;ery to which &s;he &s;aw her people expo&s;ed. With re&s;pect to the European powers that were not ac|tually engaged as principals in the war, they &s;eem|ed indu&s;triou&s;ly to avoid every &s;tep that might be con&s;trued a deviation from the mo&s;t &s;crupulous neutrality. The States-General proceeded with great circum&s;pection, in the middle cour&s;e between two powerful neighbours, equally jealous and for|midable; and the king of Spain was gratified for his forbearance with a convention, &s;ettled between

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;ac|tions at &s;ea.</NOTE> The operations at &s;ea, during the cour&s;e of this year, either in Europe or America, were far from being deci&s;ive or important. The commerce of Great Britain &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage from the acti|vity and &s;ucce&s;s of French privateers, of which a great number had been equipped in the i&s;lands of Martinique and Guadalupe. The Greenwich &s;hip of war, mounted with fifty guns, and a frigate of twenty, fell into the hands of the enemy, together with a very con&s;iderable number of trading ve&s;|&s;els. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers and privateers acquitted them&s;elves with equal vigi|lance and valour. The Duc d'Acquitaine, a large &s;hip of fifty guns, was taken in the month of June by two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, after a &s;evere engage|ment; and about the &s;ame time, the Aquilon, of nearly the &s;ame force, was driven on &s;hore and de|&s;troyed near Bre&s;t by the Antelope, one of the Bri|ti&s;h crui&s;ers. A French frigate of twenty-&s;ix guns, called the Emeraude, was taken in the channel, after a warm engagement, by an Engli&s;h &s;hip of inferior force, under the command of captain Gil|chri&s;t, a gallant and alert officer, who, in the &s;e|quel, &s;ignalized him&s;elf on divers occa&s;ions, by very extraordinary acts of valour. All the &s;ea-offi|cers &s;eemed to be animated with a noble emulation, to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country; and the &s;pirit de&s;cended even to the cap|tains of privateers, who, in&s;tead of imitating the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> former commanders of that cla&s;s, in avoiding &s;hips of force, and centering their whole attention in advantageous prizes, now encountered the armed &s;hips of the enemy, and fought with the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate valour in the pur&s;uit of national glory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fate of captain Death.</NOTE> Perhaps hi&s;tory cannot afford a more remarkable in&s;tance of de&s;perate courage, than that which was exerted in December of the preceding year, by the officers and crew of an Engli&s;h privateer, called the Terrible, under the command of captain William Death, equipped with twenty-&s;ix carriage guns, and manned with two hundred &s;ailors. On the twenty-third day of the month he engaged, and made prize of, a large French &s;hip from St. Domin|go, after an ob&s;tinate battle, in which he lo&s;t his own brother and &s;ixteen &s;eamen: then he &s;ecured with forty men his prize, which contained a valu|able cargo, and directed his cour&s;e to England; but in a few days he had the misfortune to fall in with the Vengeance, a privateer of St. Malo, carrying thirty-&s;ix large cannon, with a complement of three hundred and &s;ixty men. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to attack the prize, which was ea&s;ily retaken; then the two &s;hips bore down upon the Terrible, who&s;e main-ma&s;t was &s;hot away by the fir&s;t broad&s;ide. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;a&s;ter, the Terrible main|tained &s;uch a furious engagement again&s;t both as can hardly be paralleled in the annals of Britain. The French commander and his &s;econd were killed, with two thirds of his company; but the gallant captain Death, with the greater part of his officers, and almo&s;t his whole crew, having met with the &s;ame fate, his &s;hip was boarded by the enemy, who found no more than twenty-&s;ix per&s;ons alive, &s;ix|teen

The &s;hip it&s;elf was &s;o &s;hattered that it could &s;carce be kept above water, and the whole exhibited a &s;cene of blood, horror, and de&s;olation. The victor it|&s;elf lay like a wreck on the &s;urface; and in this condition made &s;hift, with great difficulty, to tow the Terrible into St. Malo, where &s;he was not be|held without a&s;toni&s;hment and terror. This adven|ture was no &s;ooner known in England, than a libe|ral &s;ub&s;cription was rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of Death's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a &s;trange com|bination of names belonging to this privateer, the Terrible, equipped at Execution-Dock, commanded by captain Death, who&s;e lieutenant was called Devil, and who had one Gho&s;t for his &s;urgeon.</NOTE> widow, and that part of the crew which &s;urvived the engagement. In this, and every &s;ea|rencounter that happened within the pre&s;ent year, the &s;uperiority in &s;kill and re&s;olution, was a&s;certained to the Briti&s;h mariners: for even when they fought again&s;t great odds, their courage was generally crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. In the month of Novem|ber, captain Lockhart, a young gentleman, who had already rendered him&s;elf a terror to the enemy, as commander of a &s;mall frigate, now added con&s;i|derably to his reputation, by reducing the Me|lampe, a French privateer of Bayonne, greatly &s;u|perior to his &s;hip, in number of men and weight of metal. This exploit was &s;econded by another of the &s;ame nature, in his conque&s;t of another French adventurer, called the Counte&s;s of Gramont; and a third large privateer of Bayonne was taken by captain Saumarez, commander of the Antelope. In a word, the narrow &s;eas were &s;o well guarded,

<P>On the fir&s;t day of December the king of Great Britain opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ma|je&s;ty's &s;peech at the open|ing of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment.</NOTE> &s;peech from the throne, which &s;eemed calculated to prepare the nation for the expence of maintain|ing a new war on the continent of Europe. His maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly declared, That it would have given him a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure to acquaint them, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, that his &s;ucce&s;s in carrying on the war had been equal to the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, and the extent and vigour of the mea|&s;ures formed for that purpo&s;e. He expre&s;&s;ed the firme&s;t confidence, that the &s;pirit and bravery of the nation, &s;o renowned in all times, which had formerly &s;urmounted &s;o many difficulties, were not to be abated by a few di&s;appointments, which, he tru&s;ted, might be retrieved by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the zeal and ardour of his parliament for his maje&s;ty's honour and the advantage of their coun|try. He &s;aid it was his determined re&s;olution to apply his utmo&s;t efforts for the &s;ecurity of his kingdoms, and for the recovery and protection of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and rights of his crown and &s;ubjects in America, and el&s;ewhere, as well by the &s;tronge&s;t exertion of his naval force, as by all other methods. He &s;ignified, that another great object, which he had at heart, was the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion, and the liberties of Europe; and, in that view, to encourage and adhere to his allies. For this cau&s;e, he a&s;&s;ured them, he would decline no inconveniences; and, in this cau&s;e, he earne&s;tly &s;ol|licited their hearty concurrence and vigorous a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
<PB N="185" REF="1900">
He ob&s;erved, that the late &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> Germany had given a happy turn to affairs, which it was incumbent on them to improve; and that, in &s;uch a critical conjuncture, the eyes of all Eu|rope were upon them. He particularly recom|mended to them, that his good brother and ally the king of Pru&s;&s;ia might be &s;upported in &s;uch a manner, as his magnanimity and active zeal for the common cau&s;e appeared to de&s;erve. To the com|mons he expre&s;&s;ed his concern, that the large &s;up|plies they had already granted did not produce all the good fruits they had rea&s;on to expect; but he had &s;o great a reliance on their wi&s;dom, as not to doubt of their per&s;everance. He only de&s;ired &s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;er|vice; and told them they might depend upon it, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful oeconomy &s;hould be u&s;ed. He took notice of that &s;pirit of di&s;order which had &s;hewn it&s;elf among the common people, in &s;ome parts of the kingdom: he laid injunctions upon them to u&s;e their endeavours for di&s;couraging and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch abu&s;es, and for maintaining the laws and lawful authority. He concluded with ob&s;erving, that nothing would &s;o effectually con|duce to the defence of all that was dear to the na|tion, as well as to the reducing their enemies to rea&s;on, as union and harmony among them&s;elves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on that harangue.</NOTE> The time was when every paragraph of this harangue, which the reader will perceive is not re|markable for its elegance and propriety, would have been canva&s;&s;ed and impugned by the country party in the hou&s;e of commons.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1757.</NOTE> and appointing commanders unequal to the &s;ervice. They would have inquired in what man|ner the prote&s;tant religion was endangered; and, if it was, how it could be pre&s;erved or promoted by adhering to allies, who, without provocation, had well nigh ruined the fir&s;t and principal prote&s;|tant country of the Empire. They would have &s;tarted doubts with re&s;pect to the late &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s in Germany; and hinted, that it would only &s;erve to protract the burden of a continental war. They would have owned, that the eyes of all Europe were upon them; and drawn this con&s;equence&punc; that it therefore behoved them to act with the more delicacy and caution, in di&s;charge of the &s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their con&s;tituents: a tru&s;t which their con&s;ciences would not allow to be faith|fully di&s;charged, &s;hould they ru&s;h precipitately into the de&s;tructive mea&s;ures of a ra&s;h and prodigal mini&s;try, &s;quander away the wealth of the nation, and add to the grievous incumbrances under which it groaned, in &s;upport of connexions and alliances that were equally foreign to her con&s;ideration, and pernicious to her intere&s;t. They would have in|ve&s;tigated that cau&s;e which was &s;o warmly recom|mended for &s;upport, and pretended to di&s;cover that it was a cau&s;e in which Great Britain ought to have had no concern, becau&s;e it produced a cer|tainty of lo&s;s, without the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of advan|tage. They would have varied e&s;&s;entially in their opinions of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, from the &s;enti|ments of tho&s;e who prepared the e&s;timates, and even declared &s;ome doubts about the oeconomy to be u&s;ed in managing the national expence: finally, they would have repre&s;ented the impo&s;&s;ibility of

union between the two parties, one of which &s;eemed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> bent upon reducing the other to beggary and con|tempt.

The voice of the &s;&mdash;n was adored as the oracle of a divinity; and tho&s;e happy days were now approaching, that &s;aw the commons of England pour their trea&s;ures, in &s;up|port of a German prince, with &s;uch a generous hand, that po&s;terity will be amazed at their libera|lity.</P>

The commons expre&s;&s;ed their approbation and con|fidence with equal ardour; and not one objection was made to the form or nature of the addre&s;s, though one gentleman, equally independent in his mind and fortune, took exceptions to &s;ome of the mea&s;ures which had been lately pur&s;ued.</P>

<P>This pretext was worn &s;o threadbare, that, a|mong the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind, it could no longer be u&s;ed without incurring contempt and ri|dicule. In order to per&s;uade mankind that the pro|te&s;tant religion was in danger, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify the de&s;igns that were formed again&s;t it, as well as the nature of the con&s;piracy, and to de&s;cend to particulars, properly authenti|cated. In that ca&s;e, great part of Europe would have been ju&s;tly alarmed. The States General of the United Provinces, who have made &s;uch glori|ous and indefatigable efforts in &s;upport of the prote&s;tant religion, would &s;urely have lent an help|ing hand towards its pre&s;ervation. The Danes would not have &s;tood tamely neutral, and &s;een the religion they profe&s;s expo&s;ed to the rage of &s;uch a powerful confederacy. It is not to be imagined that the Swedes, who have &s;o zealou&s;ly maintained the purity of the Prote&s;tant faith, would now join an a&s;&s;ociation who&s;e aim was the ruin of that reli|gion.
<PB N="198" REF="2030">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> It is not credible, that even the Hungarians, who profe&s;s the &s;ame faith, and other prote&s;tant &s;tates of the Empire, would enter &s;o heartily into the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who were bent upon its de|&s;truction; or that the Ru&s;&s;ians would contribute to the aggrandizement of the catholic faith and di&s;cipline, &s;o oppo&s;ite to that of the Greek church, which they e&s;pou&s;e. As, therefore, no particu|cular of &s;uch a de&s;ign was explained, no act of op|pre&s;&s;ion towards any prote&s;tant &s;tate or &s;ociety pointed out, except tho&s;e that were exerci&s;ed by the prote&s;tants them&s;elves; and as the court of Vienna repeatedly di&s;avowed any &s;uch de&s;ign, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, the unprejudiced part of mankind will be apt to conclude, that the cry of religion was u&s;ed, as in former times, to arou&s;e, alarm, and inflame: nor did the artifice prove al|together un&s;ucc$&s;$ful. Notwith&s;tanding the ge|neral luke-warmth of the age in matters of religion, it produced con&s;iderable effect among the fanatic &s;ectaries that &s;warm through the kingdom of Eng|land. The leaders of tho&s;e blind enthu&s;ia&s;ts, either actuated by the &s;pirit of delu&s;ion, or de&s;irous of re|commending them&s;elves to the protection of the higher powers, immediately $$$zed the hint, expa|tiating vehemently on the danger that impended over God's people; and exerting all their faculties to impre&s;s the belief of a religious war, which ne|ver fails to exa&s;perate and impel the minds of men to &s;uch deeds of cruelty and revenge as mu&s;t di&s;|credit all religion, and even di&s;grace humanity.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> at We&s;tmin&s;ter, imported, That the contracting powers having mutually re&s;olved to continue their efforts for their reciprocal defence and &s;ecurity, for the recovery of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the protection of their allies, and the &s;upport of the liberties of the Germannic body; his Britannic maje&s;ty had, from the&s;e con&s;iderations, determined to grant to his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty an immediate &s;uccour in mo|ney, as being the mo&s;t ready and the mo&s;t effica|cious: and their maje&s;ties having judged it proper that thereupon a convention &s;hould be made, for declaring and fixing their intentions upon this head, they had nominated and authorized their re|&s;pective mini&s;ters, who, after having communi|cated their full powers to one another, agreed to the following &s;tipulations. The king of Great Bri|tain engaged to pay in the city of London, to &s;uch per&s;on as &s;hould be authorized to receive it by his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty, the &s;um of four millions of Ger|man crowns, amounting to &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be payed at once, and in one whole &s;um, immediately after the exchange of ratifications, upon being demanded by his Pru&s;|&s;ian maje&s;ty. This prince, on his part, obliged him&s;elf to apply that &s;um to the maintaining and augmenting his forces, which &s;hould act in the be&s;t manner for the good of the common cau&s;e, and for the purpo&s;e of reciprocal defence, and mutual &s;ecurity, propo&s;ed by their &s;aid maje&s;ties. More|over, the high contracting parties engaged not to conclude any treaty of peace, truce, or neutrality,
<PB N="201" REF="2060">
nor any other &s;ort of convention or agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> with the powers engaged in the pre&s;ent war, but in concert and by mutual agreement, wherein both &s;hould be nominally comprehended. Finally, it was &s;tipulated, that this convention &s;hould be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged on both &s;ides, within the term of &s;ix weeks, to be com|puted from the day of &s;igning this pre&s;ent conven|tion, or &s;ooner, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>At this juncture, in all probability, the m&mdash;y of England imagined, that the war might be ter|minated in one campaign, by a vigorous exertion of the united powers of the contracting parties, who&s;e hands were &s;trengthened accordingly; but the&s;e &s;anguine hopes were not accompli&s;hed; the war continued to rage, and Great Britain to re|double her efforts on the continent; and, &s;hould &s;he adhere to the letter of this treaty, the war may be protracted in Germany until the people of Eng|land &s;hall be tired of giving &s;ub&s;idies for its &s;up|port.</P>
<P>All the re&s;olutions to which the committee of ways and means agreed, were executed by bills, or clau&s;es in bills, which afterwards received the royal &s;anction.

<PB N="202" REF="2070">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> that harbour was laid before the hou&s;e, and a com|mittee appointed to examine the particulars. They were of opinion, that the mouth of the harbour was too wide to admit of any fortification, or ef|fectual defence; but that the pa&s;&s;age called Nai|land&punc;point, lying higher than Hubber&s;tone-road, might be fortified, &s;o as to afford &s;afe riding and protection to the trade and navy of Great Britain: that, if it &s;hould be thought proper hereafter to e&s;tabli&s;h a yard and dock for building and equip|ping fleets at Milford, no place could, from the &s;ituation, nature, &s;oil, and a general concurrence of all nece&s;&s;ary local circum&s;tances, be more fitted for &s;uch a de&s;ign: that if proper u&s;e were made of this valuable though long neglected harbour, the di&s;tre&s;sful delays, too often embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;ap|pointing the nation in her naval operations, might be in a great mea&s;ure happily removed, to the infi|nite relief and enlargement of the kingdom in the means of improving its naval force; the nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s and free execution of which was now &s;o unhappily and frequently re&s;trained and fru&s;trated, by the want of an harbour like that of Milford|haven, framed by nature with &s;uch local advan|tages. This report appeared to be &s;o well &s;up|ported by evidence, that a bill was framed and pa&s;&s;ed into an act, for granting ten thou&s;and pounds towards carrying on the works for fortify|ing and &s;ecuring the harbour of Milford, in the county of Pembroke.</P>
<P>Other laws of national con&s;equence were en|acted, in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, with little or no oppo&s;ition. On the very fir&s;t day of their &s;itting, the commons received a petition of the mayor,

This being an urgent ca&s;e, that equal|ly intere&s;ted the humanity of the legi&s;lature and the manufactures of the kingdom, it was delibe|rated upon, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with remarkable di&s;patch. In a few days a bill was prepared, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and enacted into a law, continuing till the twenty-fourth day of December, in the pre&s;ent year, the three acts of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; for pro|hibiting the exportation of corn; for prohibiting the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits; and for allowing the im|portation of corn duty free. A &s;econd law was e&s;tabli&s;hed, regulating the price and a&s;&s;ize of bread, and &s;ubjecting to &s;evere penalties tho&s;e who &s;hould be concerned in its adulteration. In con&s;e|quence of certain re&s;olutions, taken in a committee of the whole hou&s;e, a bill was pre&s;ented for prohi|biting the payment of the bounty upon the ex|portation of corn, unle&s;s &s;old at a lower price than is allowed in an act pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t year of the

Certain it is, that as the pre&s;ervation and exten&s;ion of manufac|tures depend in a great mea&s;ure upon the mode|rate price of bread, which enables the labourer to work for low wages, and his ma&s;ter to &s;ell his com|modity as cheap as it can be afforded by the mer|chants and manufacturers of other countries, it is a flagrant ab&s;urdity to grant a bounty on the ex|portation of corn, when the price is not as low at home as abroad; but it is &s;till more ab&s;urd to grant &s;uch a large bounty as may enable the exporter to &s;ell it for a &s;maller price to foreigners, and rivals in commerce, than the Briti&s;h manufacturer is obliged to pay for it at home: and this will always be the ca&s;e, when the bounty exceeds the charge and ri&s;que of exportation.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For the importa|tion of Iri&s;h tal|low.</NOTE> The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the commons, was a bill for allowing the importa|tion of Iri&s;h tallow, &s;ugge&s;ted by a petition of &s;e|veral tallow-chandlers of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, who repre&s;ented that the &s;carcity of Briti&s;h tallow, occa&s;ioned by a di&s;temper among the horned cat|tle, the rot among the &s;heep, and the increa&s;ed con&s;umption of this commodity in the manufacto|ry of hard &s;oap, had rai&s;ed the price of it &s;o high as to make candles extremely dear: that the con|&s;equence of this dearth was, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;everely felt by the poor, very di&s;couraging to eve|ry branch of trade and manufacture, and, by indu|cing great numbers to u&s;e oil in&s;tead of candles, would ultimately prove detrimental to his maje&s;ty's revenue, and injurious to the landed intere&s;t; they therefore &s;ubmitted to the hou&s;e, whether the free admi&s;&s;ion of Iri&s;h tallow, the duty on which a|mounted almo&s;t to a prohibition, would not, in all likelihood, reduce the pre&s;ent exorbitant price of candles, prevent monopolies in &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential

The com|mittee appointed to take this petition into con&s;i|deration, reported their opinion, that the duties then payable on tallow imported from Ireland, &s;hould cea&s;e for a limited time. On this re&s;olution a bill was founded, and approved by a petition of the merchants, trade&s;men, and tallow-chandlers of Liverpool and parts adjacent. But another, couch|ed in a very different &s;train, was pre&s;ented by cer|tain proprietors of lands, landholders, &s;ale&s;men, and graziers of Buckingham&s;hire, alledging, that they had &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;&s;es by the contagious di&s;tem|per which raged a long time among their cattle, for which the advanced price of provi&s;ions had by no means been an adequate &s;atisfaction: that as the di&s;temper among the horned cattle had now entirely cea&s;ed, and the rot among the &s;heep was greatly abated, the petitioners were thoroughly convinced, from the daily decrea&s;e of the price of tallow, that the markets would be &s;ufficiently &s;up|plied without any importation: that &s;hould the bill pa&s;s into a law, the natives of Ireland would be en|abled to under&s;ell the Engli&s;h in their tallow, as they payed no land-tax, and held their farms at ea&s;y rates; con&s;equently the rents in England mu&s;t be proportionably abated; a circum&s;tance that would affect the landed intere&s;t, and be detrimental to the revenue. On the other hand, petitions in favour of the bill were brought up from Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, Lincoln&s;hire, Nottingham, Tavi&s;tock, Nor|wich and Canterbury, Coventry and Sudbury, &s;ome of the principal trading towns of England.

This mi&s;carriage was the more extraordinary, as it appeared from authentic ac|counts left on the table in the hou&s;e of commons, for the peru&s;al of the members, that the reduction of the price of tallow would occa&s;ion a very con&s;i|derable &s;aving in the expence of the navy, e&s;peci|ally in time of war, and al&s;o prove advantageous to navigation in general, as con&s;iderable quantities of tallow are u&s;ed in building and repairing the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els belonging to the merchants: the truth is, all &s;chemes of national advantage, that interfere with the private lucre of individuals, will ever be oppo&s;ed by &s;uch as are actuated by a nar|row &s;ordid &s;pirit of &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>

Lord Barrington, Mr. Thomas Gore, and Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, were ordered by the hou&s;e to prepare a bill for the &s;peedy and effectual recruiting of his maje&s;ty's land|forces and marines, which was no more than a tran&s;cript of the temporary act pa&s;&s;ed in the pre|ceding &s;e&s;&s;ion under the &s;ame title; but the majo|rity were aver&s;e to its being continued for another year, as it was attended with &s;ome prejudice to the liberty of the &s;ubject.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion for a law to e&s;ta|bli&s;h pub|lic regi&s;|ters.</NOTE> Numberle&s;s frauds having been committed, and ince&s;&s;ant law&s;uits produced, by private and clande&s;|tine conveyances, a motion was made, and leave given, to form a bill for the public regi&s;tering of all deeds, conveyances, wills, and other incum|brances, that might affect any honours, manours, lands, tenements, and hereditaments, within the kingdom of England, wherein public regi&s;ters were not already appointed by act of parliament: but this mea&s;ure, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the a&s;certainment and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, met with a violent oppo&s;i|tion; and was finally dropped, as &s;ome people ima|gine, through the influence of tho&s;e who, perhaps, had particular rea&s;ons for countenancing the pre|&s;ent my&s;terious forms of conveyancing. Such a bill mu&s;t al&s;o have been di&s;agreeable and mortify|ing to the pride of tho&s;e landholders who&s;e e&s;tates were incumbered, becau&s;e, in con&s;equence of &s;uch a regi&s;ter, every mortgage, under which they la|boured, would be exactly known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill re|lating to fi&s;hmon|gers.</NOTE> The next object to which the hou&s;e converted its attention, was a bill explaining and amending a late act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a fi&s;h-market in the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and preventing &s;candalous monopo|lies of a few engro&s;&s;ing fi&s;hmongers, who impo&s;ed

Abundance of pains was taken to render this bill effectual, for putting an end to &s;uch flagrant impo&s;ition. In|quiries were made, petitions read, coun&s;el heard, and alterations propo&s;ed: at length the bill, having pa&s;&s;ed through the lower hou&s;e, was conveyed to the lords, among whom it was &s;uffered to expire, on pretence that there was not time &s;ufficient to deliberate maturely on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed|ings on the act of habeas corpus.</NOTE> The occa&s;ion that produced the next bill, which mi&s;carried, we &s;hall explain, as an incident equally extraordinary and intere&s;ting. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, for recruiting his maje&s;ty's land-forces and marines, we have already ob&s;erved, that the commi&s;&s;ioners, thereby appointed, were ve&s;ted with a power of judging ultimately whether the per&s;ons brought before them were &s;uch as ought, by the rules pre&s;cribed in the act, to be im|pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice: for it was expre&s;ly pro|vided, that no per&s;on, &s;o impre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hould be taken out of his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice by any proce&s;s, other than for &s;ome criminal accu&s;ation. During the rece&s;s of parliament, a gentleman having been impre&s;&s;ed before the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and confined in the Savoy, his friends made application for a habeas corpus, which pro|duced &s;ome he&s;itation, and indeed an in&s;urmount|able difficulty: for, according to the writ of habeas corpus, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the &s;econd Charles, this privilege relates only to per&s;ons committed for criminal, or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matters, and the gentleman did not &s;tand in that predicament.

In order to remedy this defect, a bill for giving a more &s;peedy remedy to the &s;ubject, upon the writ of habeas corpus, was prepared, and pre|&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons, which formed it|&s;elf into a committee, and made &s;everal amend|ments. It imported, that the &s;everal provi&s;ions made in the afore&s;aid act, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Charles II. for the awarding of writs of habeas cor|pus, in ca&s;es of commitment, or detainer, for any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter, &s;hould, in like manner, extend to all ca&s;es where any per&s;on, not being committed or detained for any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter, &s;hould be confined, or re&s;trained of his or her liberty, under any colour or pretence what&s;oever: that, upon oath made by &s;uch per&s;on &s;o confined or re&s;trained, or by any other on his or her behalf, of any actual confinement or re|&s;traint, and that &s;uch confinement or re&s;traint, to the be&s;t of the knowledge and belief of the per&s;on &s;o applying, was not by virtue of any commitment or detainer for any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal mat|ter; an habeas corpus, directed to the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;o con&s;ining or re&s;training the party, as afore&s;aid, &s;hould be awarded and granted in the &s;ame manner as is directed, and under the &s;ame pe|nalties as are provided by the &s;aid act, in the ca&s;e of per&s;ons committed and detained for any crimi|nal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter: that the per&s;on or per&s;ons before whom the party &s;o con&s;ined or

The re&s;t of the bill related to the return of the writ in three days, and the penalties incurred by tho&s;e who &s;hould neglect or refu&s;e to make the due return, or to comply with any other clau&s;e of this regula|tion. The commons &s;eemed hearty in rearing up this additional buttre&s;s to the liberty of their fellow &s;ubjects, and pa&s;&s;ed the bill with the mo&s;t laudable alacrity: but in the hou&s;e of lords &s;uch a great number of objections was &s;tarted, that it &s;unk at the &s;econd reading, and the judges were ordered to prepare a bill for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to be laid be|fore that hou&s;e in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

In the mean time a remon|&s;trance was offered by certain planters and mer|chants, intere&s;ted in and trading to the Briti&s;h &s;ugar-colonies in America, alledging, that the price of negroes was greatly advanced, &s;ince the forts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa had been under the direction of the committee of the company of merchants trading to that coa&s;t; a circum&s;tance that greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and alarmed the petitioners, prevented the cultivation of the Briti&s;h colonies, and was a great detriment to the trade and navi|gation of the kingdom: that this misfortune they believed, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to the ruin|ous &s;tate and condition of the forts and &s;ettle|ments: that, in their opinion, the mo&s;t effectual method for maintaining the intere&s;t of that trade on a re&s;pectable footing, next to that of an in|corporated joint-&s;tock company, would be putting tho&s;e forts and &s;ettlements under the &s;ole direction of the commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations: that the pre&s;ervation or ruin of the American &s;u|gar-colonies went hand in hand with that of the &s;lave-trade to Africa: that, by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty, for ex|tending and improving the trade, this Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects were debarred from lodging their &s;laves and merchandize in the forts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t: they therefore prayed, that this part of the act might be repealed: that all commanders of Bri|ti&s;h and American ve&s;&s;els, free merchants, and all o|ther his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, who were &s;ettled, or might at any time thereafter &s;ettle, in Africa, &s;hould have free liberty, from &s;un-ri&s;e to &s;un-&s;et, to enter the forts and &s;ettlements, and to depo&s;it their goods

He rein|forced his &s;quadron with &s;ome &s;tore-&s;hips, mounted with guns and armed for the occa&s;ion, and &s;up|plied the deficiency in his complements, by taking on board &s;eamen from the merchant-&s;hips, and &s;ol|diers from the garri&s;on.

They re|plying in the affirmative, he added, "Then fight them we will; there is no time to be lo&s;t: return to your &s;hips, and get them ready for engaging."

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt of M. de Ker&s;in on Cape-coa&s;t-ca&s;|tle, on the coa&s;t of Africa.</NOTE> This gentleman, who&s;e name was Ker&s;in, had &s;coured the coa&s;t of Guinea, and made prize of &s;everal Engli&s;h trading &s;hips: but his chief aim was to reduce the ca&s;tle at Cape-coa&s;t, of which had he gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the other &s;ubordinate forts would have &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition. When Mr. Bell, the governor of this ca&s;tle, re|ceived intelligence that M. de Ker&s;in was a few leagues to windward, and certainly intended to at|tack Cape coa&s;t, his whole garri&s;on did not exceed thirty white men, exclu&s;ive of a few Mulatto &s;ol|diers: his &s;tock of ammunition was reduced to half a barrel of gunpowder; and his fortifications were &s;o crazy and incon&s;iderable, that, in the opi|nion of the be&s;t engineers, they could not have &s;u&s;tained for twenty minutes the fire of one great &s;hip, had it been properly directed and maintained. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, few people would have dreamed of making any preparation for defence:
<PB N="237" REF="2440">
but Mr. Bell entertained other &s;entiments, and ac|quitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> him&s;elf with equal courage and di&s;cretion. He forthwith procured a &s;upply of gunpowder, and a reinforcement of about fifty men, from certain trading ve&s;&s;els that happened to be upon that part of the coa&s;t. He mounted &s;ome &s;pare cannon upon an occa&s;ional battery; and a&s;&s;embling a body of twelve hundred negroes, well armed, under the command of their chief, on who&s;e attachment he could depend, ordered them to take po&s;t at the place where he apprehended the enemy would at|tempt a landing. The&s;e precautions were hardly taken when the French &s;quadron appeared, and in a little time their attack began: but they met with &s;uch a warm reception, that in le&s;s than two hours they de&s;i&s;ted, leaving the ca&s;tle very little damaged, and immediately made &s;ail for the We&s;t Indies; very much to the di&s;appointment and mortification of the Dutch officers belonging to the fort of El|mina, in the &s;ame neighbourhood, who made no &s;cruple of expre&s;&s;ing their wi&s;hes publicly in favour of the French commodore, and at a di&s;tance viewed the engagement with the mo&s;t partial eagerne&s;s and impatience. M. de Ker&s;in was generally blamed for his want of conduct and re&s;olution in this attempt: but he is &s;aid to have been deceived in his opinion of the real &s;tate of Cape-coa&s;t-ca&s;tle by the vigorous and re&s;olute exertion of the gover|nor, and was apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing a ma&s;t in the engagement; a lo&s;s which he could not have re|paired on the whole coa&s;t of Africa.

the &s;mall i&s;land of Gonave. After Mr. de Ker&s;in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> had taken his departure from Cape Francois for Europe, admiral Cotes, beating up to windward from Port Royal in Jamaica with three &s;hips of the line, received intelligence that there was a French fleet at Port au Prince, ready to &s;ail on their return to Europe: captain Forre&s;t then pre&s;ented the ad|miral with a plan for an attack on this place, and urged it earne&s;tly. This however was declined, and captain Forre&s;t directed to cruize off the i&s;land Gonave for two days only, the admiral enjoining him to return at the expiration of the time, and re|join the &s;quadron at Cape Nicholas. Accordingly captain Forre&s;t, in the Augu&s;ta, proceeded up the bay, between the i&s;land Gonave and Hi&s;paniola, with a view to execute a plan which he had him&s;elf pro|jected. Next day in the afternoon, tho' he perceived two &s;loops, he forebore cha&s;ing, that he might not ri&s;que a di&s;covery: for the &s;ame purpo&s;e he hoi&s;ted Dutch colours, and di&s;gui&s;ed his &s;hip with tarpaulins. At five in the afternoon he di&s;covered &s;even &s;ail of &s;hips &s;teering to the we&s;tward, and hauled from them to avoid &s;u&s;picion; but at the approach of night gave chace with all the &s;ail he could carry. About ten he perceived two &s;ail, one of which fired a gun, and the other made the be&s;t of her way for Leoganne, another harbour in the bay. At this period captain Forre&s;t reckoned eight &s;ail to lee|ward, near another port called Petit Goave: coming up with the &s;hip which had fired the gun, &s;he &s;ub|mitted without oppo&s;ition, after he had hailed and told her captain what he was, produced two of his large&s;t cannon, and threatened to &s;ink her if &s;he &s;hould give the lea&s;t alarm. He forthwith &s;hifted

Then he made &s;ail after the re&s;t, and in the dawn of the morning, finding him&s;elf in the middle of their fleet, he began to fire at them all in their turns, as he could bring his guns to bear: they re|turned the fire for &s;ome time; at length the Mar|guerite, the Solide, and the Theodore &s;truck their colours.

The horror and con&s;ternation of &s;uch a &s;cene are not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. When all endea|vours proved fruitle&s;s, and no hope of pre&s;erving the &s;hip remained, the barge was hoi&s;ted out for the pre&s;ervation of the admiral, who entered it ac|cordingly; but all di&s;tinction of per&s;ons being now aboli&s;hed, the &s;eamen ru&s;hed into it in &s;uch crowds, that in a few moments it over&s;et.

The town, however, was found too well fortified, both by art and nature, to admit of any attempt by &s;ea with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and therefore it was re&s;olved to make a de&s;cent in the neighbourhood. After the fleet had been, by con|trary winds, detained &s;everal days in &s;ight of the French coa&s;t, it arrived in the bay of Cancalle, about two leagues to the ea&s;tward of St. Malo; and Mr. Howe having &s;ilenced a &s;mall battery, which the enemy had occa&s;ionally rai&s;ed upon the beach, the troops were landed, without farther oppo&s;ition, on the &s;ixth day of June.

The forces, while they remained on &s;hore, were re&s;trained from all outrages by the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;cipline; and the French hou&s;es, which their inhabitants had aban|doned, were left untouched. Immediately after their landing, the duke of Marlborough, as com|mander in chief, publi&s;hed and di&s;tributed a mani|fe&s;to, addre&s;&s;ed to the people of Bretagne, giving them to under&s;tand, that his de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t was not effected with a de&s;ign to make war on the inhabitants of the open country, except &s;uch as &s;hould be found in arms, or otherwi&s;e oppo&s;ing the operations of his Britannic maje&s;ty: that all who were willing to remain in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their effects, might &s;tay unmole&s;ted in their re&s;pective dwellings, and follow their u&s;ual occu|pations: that, be&s;ides the cu&s;toms and taxes they u&s;ed to pay to their own king, nothing &s;hould be required of them but what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army: and that, for all provi&s;ions brought in, they &s;hould be payed in ready money. He concluded this notice with de|claring, that if, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e a&s;&s;urances of protection, they &s;hould carry off their effects and provi&s;ions, and abandon the places of their habi|tation, he would treat them as enemies, and de|&s;troy their hou&s;es with fire and &s;word. To the ma|gi&s;tracy of St. Malo he likewi&s;e &s;ent a letter, im|porting, that as all the inhabitants of the towns and villages between Dinant, Rennes, and Doll, now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had de&s;erted their habita|tions,

The&s;e threats, however, were not put in force, although the magi&s;trates of St. Malo did not think proper to comply with his injunction.</P>
<P>But it was found altogether impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent irregularities among troops that were natural|ly licentious. Some hou&s;es were pillaged, and not without acts of barbarity: but tho&s;e offenders were brought to immediate ju&s;tice; and it mu&s;t be owned, as an inconte&s;table proof of the general's humanity, that in de&s;troying the magazines of the enemy at St. Servan, which may be termed the &s;uburbs of St. Malo, he ordered one &s;mall &s;tore-hou&s;e to be &s;pared, becau&s;e it could not be &s;et on fire without endangering the whole di&s;trict.</P>

But the wind blowing violently towards the evening, the boats were re-&s;hipped, and the fleet obliged to quit the land, in order to avoid the dangers of a lee-&s;hore. Next day, the weather being more moderate, they returned to the &s;ame &s;tation, and orders were given to prepare for a de&s;cent; but the duke of Marlborough having taken a view of the coa&s;t in an open cutter, accompanied by commodore Howe, thought pro|per to wave the attempt. Their next &s;tep was to bear away before the wind for Cherbourg, in the neighbourhood of which place the fleet came to an|chor. Here &s;ome of the tran&s;ports received the fire of &s;ix different batteries; and a con&s;iderable body of troops appeared in arms, to di&s;pute the landing: neverthele&s;s the general re&s;olved that the forts Querqueville, l'Hommet, and Gallet, &s;hould be attacked in the night by the fir&s;t regiment of guards. The &s;oldiers were actually di&s;tributed in the flat-bottomed boats, and every preparation made for this enterprize, when the wind began to blow with &s;uch violence, that the troops could not be landed without the mo&s;t imminent danger and difficulty; nor properly &s;u&s;tained, in ca&s;e of a re|pul&s;e, even if the di&s;embarkation could have been effected. This attempt therefore was laid a&s;ide; but at the &s;ame time a re&s;olution taken to &s;tand in towards the &s;hore with the whole fleet, to cover a general landing.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bri|ti&s;htroops land at Cher|bourg.</NOTE> The remainder of the troops being reimbarked, and every thing prepared for the &s;econd expedi|tion, the fleet &s;ailed from St. Helen's on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; and after a tedious pa&s;&s;age from calms and contrary winds, anchored on the &s;eventh in the bay of Cherbourg.

All night long they ravaged the adjacent country with|out re&s;traint; and as no guards had been regularly placed in the &s;treets and avenues of Cherbourg, to prevent di&s;orders, the town it&s;elf was not ex|empted from pillage and brutality.

Great &s;ums of money had been expended upon the harbour and ba&s;on of Cherbourg, which at one time was con&s;i|dered by the French court as an object of great im|portance, from its &s;ituation re&s;pecting the river Seine, as well as the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of England; but as the works were left unfini&s;hed, in all appearance the plan had grown into di&s;reputation. The enemy had rai&s;ed &s;everal unconnected batteries along the bay, but the town it&s;elf was quite open and de|fencele&s;s.

Several &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought by the out parties of each army, in one of which Capt.

A &s;light intrenchment being rai&s;ed, &s;ufficient to de|fend the la&s;t divi&s;ion that &s;hould be reimbarked, the &s;tores and artillery were &s;hipped, and the light hor&s;es conveyed on board their re&s;pective tran&s;ports, by means of platforms laid in the flat-bottomed ve&s;|&s;els.

No regard being payed to this intimation, the hou&s;es were actually &s;et on fire as &s;oon as the troops had formed their camp about two miles on the other &s;ide of the inlet. Next morning he proceed|ed to the village of Matignon, where, after &s;ome &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hing, the French piquets appeared, drawn up in order, to the number of two battali|ons; but having &s;u&s;tained a few &s;hot from the Engli&s;h field-pieces, and &s;eeing the grenadiers ad|vance, they &s;uddenly di&s;per&s;ed. General Bligh continuing his route through the village, encamp|ed in the open ground about three miles from the bay of St. Cas, which was this day reconnoitred for reimbarkation: for he now received undoubted in|telligence, that the duke d'Aiguillon had advan|ced from Bre&s;t to Lambale, within &s;ix miles of the Engli&s;h camp, at the head of twelve regular battalions, &s;ix &s;quadrons, two regiments of mili|tia, eight mortars, and ten pieces of cannon. The bay of St. Cas was covered by an intrenchment which the enemy had thrown up, to prevent or oppo&s;e any d$&s;embarkation; and on the out&s;ide of this work there was a range of &s;and-hills extend|ing along &s;hore, which could have &s;erved as a co|ver to the enemy, from whence they might have an|noyed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They re|tire to the bay of St. Cas.</NOTE> Had the troops decamped in the night without noi&s;e, in all probability they would have arrived at the beach before the French had received the lea&s;t intelligence of their motion; and in that ca&s;e, the whole army, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix thou&s;and men, might have been reimbarked without the lea&s;t in|terruption: but in&s;tead of this cautious manner of proceeding, the drums were beaten at two o'clock in the morning, as if with intention to give notice to the enemy, who forthwith repeated the &s;ame &s;ignal. The troops were in motion before three, and though the length of the march did not ex|ceed three miles, the halts and interruptions w$$e &s;o numerous and frequent, that they did not arrive on the beach at St. Cas till nine. Then the embar|kation was begun, and might have been happly fi|ni&s;hed, had the tran&s;ports lain near the &s;hore, and received the men as fa&s;t as the boats could have conveyed them on board without di&s;tinction; but many &s;hips rode at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and every boat carried the men on board the re&s;pective tran&s;ports to which they belonged; a punctilio of di&s;po&s;ition, by which a great deal of time was un|nece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed. The &s;mall &s;hips and bomb|ketches were brought near the &s;hore to cover the reimbarkation; and a con&s;iderable number of &s;ea|officers was &s;tationed on the beach to &s;uperintend

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trong body of French advances again&s;t them.</NOTE> The Briti&s;h forces had &s;kirmi&s;hed a little on the march, but no con&s;iderable body of the enemy appeared until the embarkation was begun; then they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an eminence by a wind-mill, and forthwith opened a battery of ten cannon and eight mortars, from whence they fired with con&s;i|derable effect upon the &s;oldiers on the beach, and on the boats in their pa&s;&s;age. They afterwards began to march down the hill, partly covered by a hollow-way on their left, with de&s;ign to gain a wood, where they might form and extend them|&s;elves along the front of the Engli&s;h, and advance again&s;t them under &s;helter of the &s;and-hills; but in their de&s;cent they &s;uffered extremely from the cannon and mortars of the &s;hipping, which made great havock, and threw them into confu&s;ion. Their line of march down the hill was &s;taggered, and for &s;ome time continued in &s;u&s;pence; then they turned off to one &s;ide, extended them&s;elves along a hill to their left, and advanced in a hollow-way, from whence they &s;uddenly ru&s;hed out to the at|tack. Though the greater part of the Briti&s;h troops were already embarked, the rear-guard, con|&s;i&s;ting of all the grenadiers, and half of the fir&s;t regiment of guards, remained on the &s;hore to the number of fifteen hundred, under the command of major-general Dury. This officer &s;eeing the French

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> advance, ordered his troops to form in grand di|vi&s;ions, and march from behind the bank that co|vered them, in order to charge the enemy before they could be formed on the plain. Had this &s;tep been taken, when it was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. Dury, before the French were di&s;engaged from the hollow-way, perhaps it might have &s;o far &s;ucceed|ed as to di&s;concert and throw them into confu&s;ion: but by this time they had extended them&s;elves in|to a very formidable front, and no hope remained of being able to with&s;tand &s;uch a &s;uperior num|ber. In&s;tead of attempting to fight again&s;t &s;uch odds in an open field of battle, they might have retreat|ed along the beach to a rock on the left, in which progre&s;s their right flank could have been &s;ecured by the intrenchment; and the enemy could not have pur&s;ued them along the &s;hore, without being expo&s;ed to &s;uch a fire from the &s;hipping, as in all probability they could not have &s;u&s;tained. This &s;cheme was likewi&s;e propo&s;ed to Mr. Dury; but he &s;eemed to be actuated by a &s;pirit of infatuation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They cut off the rear guard of the Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE> The Engli&s;h line being drawn up in uneven ground, began the action with an irregular fire from right to left, which the enemy returned; but their u&s;ual fortitude and re&s;olution &s;eemed to for|&s;ake them on this occa&s;ion. They &s;aw them&s;elves in danger of being &s;urrounded, and cut in pieces; their officers dropped on every &s;ide; and all hope of retreat was now intercepted. In this cruel di|lemma their &s;pirits failed; they were &s;eized with a pannic; they faultered, they broke, and in le&s;s than five minutes after the engagement began, they fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, pur&s;ued by the enemy, who no &s;ooner &s;aw them give way than they fell in

General Dury being dangerou&s;ly wounded, ran into the &s;ea, where he peri&s;hed; and this was the fate of a great number, officers as well as &s;oldiers. Many &s;wam towards the boats and ve&s;|&s;els which were ordered to give them all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but by far the greater number were ei|ther butchered on the beach, or drowned in the wa|ter: a &s;mall body, however, in&s;tead of throwing them&s;elves into the &s;ea, retired to the rock on the left, where they made a &s;tand, until they had ex|hau&s;ted their ammunition, and then &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The havock was moreover increa|&s;ed by the &s;hot and &s;hells di&s;charged from the bat|tery which the enemy had rai&s;ed on the hill: the &s;laughter would not have been &s;o great, had not the French &s;oldiers been exa&s;perated by the fire from the frigates, which was &s;till maintained even after the Engli&s;h troops were routed: but this was no &s;ooner &s;ilenced by a &s;ignal from the commo|dore, than the enemy exhibited a noble example of moderation and humanity, in granting immedi|ate quarter and protection to the vanqui&s;hed. A|bout one thou&s;and cho&s;en men of the Engli&s;h ar|my were killed and taken pri&s;oners on this occa|&s;ion: nor was the advantage cheaply purcha&s;ed by the French troops, among whom the &s;hot and &s;hells from the frigates and ketches had done great execution. The clemency of the victors was the more remarkable, as the Briti&s;h troops in this ex|pedition had been &s;hamefully guilty of marauding, pillaging, burning, and other exce&s;&s;es.</P>

We ought al&s;o to u&s;e our be&s;t endea|vours to de&s;erve this treatment at the hands of a civilized enemy. Let us be humane in our turns to tho&s;e whom the fate of war hath &s;ubjected to our power: let us, in pro&s;ecuting our military o|perations, maintain the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline among the troops, and religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from all acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. Thus, a a laudable emulation will undoubtedly en&s;ue, and the powers at war, vie with each other in humanity and politene&s;s. In o|ther re&s;pects, the commander of an invading arma|ment will always find his account in being well with the common people of the country in which the de&s;cent is made. By civil treatment and &s;ea&s;onable gratifications, they will be encouraged to bring in|to the camp regular &s;upplies of provi&s;ion and re|fre&s;hment; they will mingle with the &s;oldiers, and even form friend&s;hips among them; &s;erve as guides, me&s;&s;engers, and interpreters; let out their cattle for hire as draught-hor&s;es; work in their own per|&s;ons as day-labourers; di&s;cover proper fords, bridges, roads, pa&s;&s;es, and defiles; and, if artful|ly managed, communicate many u&s;eful hints of intelligence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And upon &s;uch de|&s;cents in particu|lar.</NOTE> If great care and circum&s;pection be not exerted in maintaining di&s;cipline, and bridling the licen|tious di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oldiers, &s;uch inva&s;ions will be productive of nothing but mi&s;carriage and di&s;|grace: for this, at be&s;t, is but a piratical way of carrying on the war; and the troops engaged in it are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, debauched by the nature of the &s;ervice. They are crouded together in
<PB N="263" REF="2720">
tran&s;ports, where the minute particulars of mili|tary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> order cannot be ob&s;erved, even though the good of the &s;ervice greatly depends upon a due ob&s;ervance of the&s;e forms. The &s;oldiers grow neg|ligent, and inattentive to cleanne&s;s and the exte|rior ornaments of dre&s;s: they become &s;lovenly, &s;lothful, and altogether unfit for a return of duty: they are tumbled about occa&s;ionally in &s;hips and boats, landed and reimbarked in a tumultuous manner, under a divided and di&s;orderly command: they are accu&s;tomed to retire at the fir&s;t report of an approaching enemy, and to take &s;helter on an|other element; nay, their &s;mall pillaging parties are often obliged to fly before unarmed pea&s;ants. Their duty on &s;uch occa&s;ions is the mo&s;t unmanly part of a &s;oldier's office; namely, to ruin, ravage and de&s;troy. They &s;oon yield to the temptation of pillage, and are habituated to rapine: they give a loo&s;e to intemperance, riot, and intoxication; commit a thou&s;and exce&s;&s;es; and, when the enemy appears, run on board the &s;hips with their booty. Thus the dignity of the &s;ervice is deba&s;ed: they lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of honour, and of &s;hame: they are no longer re&s;tricted by military laws, nor over-awed by the authority of officers:&mdash;in a word, they dege|nerate into a &s;pecies of lawle&s;s buccaneers. From &s;uch a total relaxation of morals and di&s;cipline, what can en&s;ue but riot, confu&s;ion, di&s;honour, and defeat? All the advantage that can be expected from the&s;e &s;udden &s;tarts of inva&s;ion, will &s;carce over-ballance the evils we have mentioned, toge|ther with the extraordinary expence of equipping armaments of this nature. True it is, the&s;e de&s;cents oblige the French king to employ a con&s;iderable

Should it be judged expedient, however, to pro&s;ecute this de|&s;ultory kind of war, the commanders employed in it, will do well to con&s;ider, that a de&s;cent ought never to be hazarded in an enemy's country, without having taken proper precautions to &s;ecure a re|treat; that the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline ought to be pre|&s;erved, during all the operations of the campaign; that a general ought never to di&s;embark but upon a well-concerted plan, nor commence his military tran&s;actions without &s;ome immediate point or ob|ject in view; that a reimbarkation ought never to be attempted, except from a clear open beach, where the approaches of an enemy may be &s;een, and the troops covered by the fire of their &s;hipping. Tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to reflect upon the particu|lars of this la&s;t expedition, owned them&s;elves at a lo&s;s to account for the conduct of the g&mdash;, in re|maining on &s;hore after the de&s;ign upon St. Malo was laid a&s;ide; in penetrating &s;o far into the coun|try, without any vi&s;ible object; neglecting the re|peated intelligence which he received; communi|cating by beat of drum his midnight motions to an enemy of double his force; loitering near &s;even hours in a march of three miles; and, la&s;tly, at|tempting the reimbarkation of the troops at a place where no proper mea&s;ures had been taken for their cover and defence. After the action of St. Cas, &s;ome civilities, by me&s;&s;age, pa&s;&s;ed between the

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt upon Cherbourg had elevated the people to a degree of childi&s;h triumph; and the g&mdash;thought proper to indulge this pe|tulant &s;pirit of exultation, by expo&s;ing twenty-one pieces of French cannon in Hyde-park, from whence they were drawn in proce&s;&s;ion to the Tower, amid&s;t the acclamations of the populace. From this pinnacle of elation and pride they were precipitated to the aby&s;s of de&s;pondence or dejec|tion, by the account of the mi&s;carriage at St. Cas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exulta|tion of the French people.</NOTE> which buoyed up the &s;pirits of the French in the &s;ame proportion. The people of that nation began to &s;tand in need of &s;ome &s;uch cordial after the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained, and the mini&s;try of Ver|&s;ailles did not fail to make the mo&s;t of this advan|tage: they publi&s;hed a pompous narrative of the battle at St. Cas, and magnified into a mighty victory the puny check which they had given to the rear-guard of an incon&s;iderable detachment. The people received it with implicit belief, becau&s;e it was agreeable to their pa&s;&s;ions, and congratu|lated them&s;elves upon their &s;ucce&s;s in hyperboles, dictated by that vivacity &s;o peculiar to the French nation. Indeed, the&s;e are artifices which the mi|ni&s;ters of every nation find it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e at certain conjunctures, in governing the turbulent and capricious multitude.</P>

The crui&s;ers, however, &s;till continued active and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captures from the enemy.</NOTE> alert. Captain Hervey, in the &s;hip Monmouth, de&s;troyed a French &s;hip of forty guns in the i&s;land of Malta; an exploit of which the Malte&s;e loudly complained, as a violation of their neutrality. A|bout twenty &s;ail of &s;mall French ve&s;&s;els were dri|ven a&s;hore on the rocks of Bretagne, by &s;ome crui&s;ers belonging to the fleet commanded by lord An&s;on, after a &s;mart engagement with two frigates, under who&s;e convoy they &s;ailed. In the month of November the Belliqueux, a French &s;hip of war, mounted with &s;ixty-four guns, having, by mi&s;take, run up St. George's channel, and anchored in Lun|dy-road, captain Saumarez of the Antelope, then lying in King-road, immediately weighed and went in que&s;t of her, according to the advice he had re|ceived. When he appeared, the French captain heaved up his anchor, and made a &s;hew of prepa|ring for an engagement; but &s;oon hauled down his colours, and without firing a &s;hot, &s;urrendered, with a complement of four hundred and &s;eventeen men, to a &s;hip of inferior force, both in number of hands and weight of metal.</P>

Complaints of the&s;e outrages being made to the court of London, the lords of the admiralty pro|mi&s;ed, in the Gazette, a reward of five hundred pounds, without deduction, to any per&s;on who &s;hould di&s;cover the offenders concerned in the&s;e acts of piracy. Some of them were detected accord|ingly, and brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great number of Dutch &s;hips ta|ken.</NOTE> The Dutch had for &s;ome time carried on a very con&s;iderable traffic, not only in taking the fair ad|vantages of their neutrality, but al&s;o in &s;upplying the French with naval &s;tores, and tran&s;porting the produce of the French &s;ugar-colonies to Europe, as carriers hired by the proprietors. The Engli&s;h government, incen&s;ed at this unfair commerce, pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch flagrant partiality for their enemies, i&s;&s;ued orders for the crui&s;ers to arre&s;t all &s;hips of neutral powers that &s;hould have French property on board; and the&s;e orders were execu|ted with rigour and &s;everity.

Remon&s;trances were made to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, who expo&s;tulated in their turn with the deputies of the States General; and the two nations were inflamed again&s;t each other with the mo&s;t bitter animo&s;ity. The Briti&s;h re&s;ident at the Hague, in a conference with the States, repre&s;ented, that the king his ma&s;ter could not hope to &s;ee peace &s;peedily re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, if the neutral princes &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a right of carrying on the trade of his enemies: that he expected, from their known ju&s;tice, and the alliance by which they were &s;o nearly connected with his &s;ubjects, they would hone&s;tly abandon this fraudulent commerce, and agree, that naval &s;tores &s;hould be comprehend|ed in the cla&s;s of contraband commodities. He an&s;wered &s;ome articles of the complaints they had made with an appearance of candour and mode|ration; declared his maje&s;ty's abhorrence of the violences which had been committed upon the &s;ub|jects of the United Provinces; explained the &s;teps which had been taken by the Engli&s;h government to bring the offenders to ju&s;tice, as well as to pre|vent &s;uch outrages for the future; and a&s;&s;ured them, that his Britannic maje&s;ty had nothing more at heart than to renew, and maintain in full force, the mutual confidence and friend&s;hip by which the maritime powers of England and Holland had been &s;o long united. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and affection were not &s;ufficient to quiet the minds and appea&s;e the re&s;entment of the Dutch mer|chants; and the French party, which was both

The court of Ver&s;ailles did not fail to &s;eize this opportunity of in&s;inuation: while, on one hand, their mini&s;ters and emi&s;&s;aries in Holland exaggerated the indigni|ties and injuries which the States had &s;u&s;tained, from the in&s;olence and rapacity of the Engli&s;h; they, on the other hand, flattered and cajoled them with little advantages in trade, and formal profe&s;|&s;ions of re&s;pect. Such was the memorial delivered by the count D'Affry, intimating that the Em|pre&s;s queen being under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of employing all her forces to defend her hereditary dominions in Germany, &s;he had been obliged to withdraw her troops from O&s;tend and Nieuport; and applied to the French king, as her ally neare&s;t at hand, to garri&s;on the&s;e two places, which, how|ever, &s;hould be re&s;tored at the peace, or &s;ooner, &s;hould her Imperial maje&s;ty think proper.</P>

This con&s;ideration forwarded the plan for annex|ing the country to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Great Britain. The project was fir&s;t conceived by Mr. Thomas Cumming, a &s;en&s;ible quaker, who, as a private merchant, had made a voyage to Portenderrick, an adjoining part of the coa&s;t, and contracted a per&s;onal acquaintance with Amir the Moori&s;h king of Legibelli <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name the natives give to that part of South Barbary, known to merchants and navigators by that of The Gum Coa&s;t, and called in maps, The Sandy De&s;art of Sara, and &s;ometimes Za|ra.</NOTE>. He found this African prince ex|tremely well di&s;po&s;ed towards the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, whom he publicly preferred to all other Europeans, and &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t the French, that he declared he &s;hould never be ea&s;y till they were exterminated from the river Senegal. At that very time he had commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired that the king of Eng|land would &s;end out an armament to reduce Fort Louis and Goree, with &s;ome &s;hips of force to pro|tect the traders. In that ca&s;e, he promi&s;ed to join his Britannic maje&s;ty's forces, and grant an exclu|&s;ive trade to his &s;ubjects. Mr. Cumming not on|ly perceived the advantage that would re&s;ult from &s;uch an exclu&s;ive privilege with regard to the gum, but fore&s;aw many other important con&s;e|quences of an exten&s;ive trade in a country, which, over and above the gum-&s;enega, contains many valu|able articles, &s;uch as gold du&s;t, elephants teeth, hides, cotton, bees-wax, &s;laves, o&s;trich feathers, indi|go,

Elevated with the pro|&s;pect of an acqui&s;ition &s;o valuable to his country, this hone&s;t quaker was equally minute and indefa|tigable in his inquiries, touching the commerce of the coa&s;t, as well as the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the French &s;ettlements on the river Senegal; and, at his return to England, actually formed the plan of an expedition for the conque&s;t of Fort Louis. This was pre&s;ented to the board of trade, by whom it was approved, after a &s;evere examination: but it required the patrotic zeal, and invincible per&s;eve|rance of Mr. Cumming, to &s;urmount a variety of ob&s;tacles before it was adopted by the mini&s;try; and even then it was not executed in its full ex|tent. He was abridged of one large &s;hip; and in lieu of &s;ix hundred land-forces to be draughted from different regiments, which he in vain de|manded, fir&s;t from the d&mdash;of C&mdash;, and af|terwards from lord L&mdash;r, the lords of the ad&mdash;y allotted two hundred marines only for this &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The incidents of the war that happened in the We&s;t Indies, during the&s;e occurrences, may be re|duced to a &s;mall compa&s;s. Nothing extraordinary was atchieved in the neighbourhood of Jamaica, where admiral Cotes commanded a &s;mall &s;quadron, from which he detached crui&s;ers occa&s;ionally for the protection of the Briti&s;h commerce; and at Antigua the trade was effectually &s;ecured by the vigilance of captain Tyrrel, who&s;e courage and activity were equal to his conduct and circum&s;pec|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallant exploit of captain Tyrrel.</NOTE> In the month of March this gentleman, with his own &s;hip the Buckingham, and the Cam|bridge, another of the line, demoli&s;hed a fort on the i&s;land of Martinique, and de&s;troyed four priva|teers riding under its protection: but his valour appeared much more con&s;picuous in a &s;ub&s;equent engagement, which happened in the month of November.

Tyrrel immediately gave chace with all the &s;ail<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> he could carry; and the Weazle, running clo&s;e to the enemy, received a whole broad&s;ide from the large &s;hip, which however, &s;he &s;u&s;tained without much damage: neverthele&s;s Mr. Tyrrel ordered her commander to keep aloof, as he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed able to bear the &s;hock of large metal, and he him&s;elf prepared for the engagement. The enemy's large &s;hip the Flori&s;&s;ant, though of much greater force than the Buckingham, in&s;tead of lying-to for his coming up, made a running fight with her &s;tern-chace, while the two frigates an|noyed him in his cour&s;e, &s;ometimes raking him fore and aft, and &s;ometimes lying on his quarter. At length he came along-&s;ide of the Flori&s;&s;ant, within pi&s;tol-&s;hot, and poured in a whole broad|&s;ide, which did con&s;iderable execution. The &s;a|lutation was returned with equal vivacity, and a fu|rious engagement en&s;ued. Captain Tyrrel was wounded in the face, and lo&s;t three fingers of his right hand; &s;o that, being intirely di&s;abled, he was obliged to delegate the command of the &s;hip to his fir&s;t lieutenant, Mr. Mar&s;hal, who continued the battle with great gallantry until he lo&s;t his life: then the charge devolved to the &s;econd lieutenant, who acquitted him&s;elf with equal honour, and &s;u&s;|tained a de&s;perate fight again&s;t the three &s;hips of the enemy. The officers and crew of the Buck|ingham exerted them&s;elves with equal vigour and deliberation; and captain Troy, who commanded a detachment of marines on the poop, plied his &s;mall arms &s;o effectually as to drive the French from their quarters. At length confu&s;ion, terror, and uproar prevailing on board the Flori&s;&s;ant, her

Nothing but this circum&s;tance could have prevented a Briti&s;h &s;hip of &s;ixty-five guns, indifferently manned, in re&s;pect to number, from taking a French &s;hip of the line, mounted with &s;eventy-four pieces of cannon, pro|vided with &s;even hundred men, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two large frigates, one of thirty-eight guns, and the other wanting two of this number. The lo&s;s of the Buckingham, in this action, did not exceed twenty men killed and wounded; whereas the number of the &s;lain on board the Flori&s;&s;ant did not fall &s;hort of one hundred and eighty, and that of her wounded is &s;aid to have exceeded three hun|dred. She was &s;o di&s;abled in her hull, that &s;he could hardly be kept afloat until &s;he reached Mar|tinique, where &s;he was repaired; and the large&s;t frigate, together with the lo&s;s of forty men, re|ceived &s;uch damage as to be for &s;ome time quite un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t Indies the tran&s;actions of the war were chequered with a variety of &s;ucce&s;s; but, on the whole, the de&s;igns of the enemy were intirely defeated.

The French commodore, having &s;u&s;tained a warm action for about two hours, bore away with his whole fleet; and being joined by two &s;hips, formed a line of battle again to leeward. Admiral Pocock's own &s;hip, and &s;ome others, being greatly damaged in their ma&s;ts and rigging, two of his captains having mi&s;behaved in the ac|tion, and night coming on, he did not think it ad|vi&s;eable to pur&s;ue them with all the &s;ail he could carry; but neverthele&s;s he followed them at a pro|per di&s;tance, &s;tanding to the &s;outh-we&s;t, in order to maintain the weather-gage, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be able to renew the action in the morning.

Such was the i&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t acton between the Engli&s;h and French &s;quadrons in the Ea&s;t-Indies, which, over and above the lo&s;s of a capital &s;hip, is &s;aid to have co&s;t the enemy about five hundred men, whereas the Briti&s;h admiral did not lo&s;e one-fifth part of that number. Being di&s;&s;atisfied with the behaviour of three captains, he, on his return to Madra&s;s, appointed a court-martial to enquire into their conduct; two were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from that &s;ervice, and the third was &s;entenced to lo&s;e one year's rank as a po&s;t-captain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort St. David's taken by the French.</NOTE> In the mean time Mr. Lally had di&s;embarked his troops at Pondicherry, and, taking the field, im|mediately inve&s;ted the fort of St. David, while the &s;quadron blocked it up by &s;ea; two Engli&s;h &s;hips being at anchor in the road when the enemy ar|rived, their captains &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cap|ing, ran them on &s;hore, &s;et them on fire, and re|tired with their men into the fortre&s;s, which, how|ever, was in a few days &s;urrendered.

The engage|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second engage|ment be|tween ad|miral Po|cock and mon&s;ieur d'Apch&eacute;.</NOTE> began with great impetuo&s;ity on both &s;ides, but in little more than ten minutes Mr. d'Apch&eacute; &s;et his fore&s;ail and bore away, his whole &s;quadron following his example, and maintaining a running fight in a very irregular line.

The Empre&s;s-queen, over and above her de&s;ire of retrieving Sile&s;ia, which was her primary aim, gave way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of per&s;onal hatred and revenge, to the gratification of which &s;he may be &s;aid to have &s;acrificed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the intere&s;ts of her family, as well as the repo&s;e of the empire, by admitting the natural enemies of her hou&s;e into the Au&s;trian Nether|lands, and inviting them to invade the dominions of her co-e&s;tates with a formidable army.

In oppo&s;ition to this formidable confede|racy, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty was, by the &s;ub&s;idy from England, the &s;poils of Saxony, and the revenues of Brandenbourg, enabled to maintain an army of one hundred and forty thou&s;and men; while the elector of Hanover a&s;&s;embled a body of &s;ixty thou|&s;and men, compo&s;ed of his own electoral troops, with the auxiliary mercenaries of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, Bucke|bourg, Saxegotha, and Brun&s;wic Wolfembuttle, all of them maintained by the pay of Great Britain. At this juncture, indeed, there was no other fund for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as the countries of Hanover and He&s;&s;e were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and in the former the government was entirely changed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French king changes the admi|ni&s;tration of Hano|ver.</NOTE> In the month of December, in the preceding year, a farmer of the revenues from Paris arrived at Hanover, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his office, in order to act by virtue of powers from one John Faidy, to whom the French king granted the di|rection, receipt, and admini&s;tration of all the duties and revenues of the electorate. This director was, by a decree of the council of &s;tate, impowered to receive the revenues not only of Hanover, but al&s;o of all other countries that &s;hould be &s;ubjected to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty in the cour&s;e of the campaign; and to remove the receivers who had

been employed in any part of the direction, receipt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1758&punc;</NOTE> and admini&s;tration of the duties and revenues of Hanover, and appoint others in their room. The French king, by the &s;ame decree, ordained, that all per&s;ons who had been intru&s;ted under the preceding government with titles, papers, accounts, regi&s;ters, or e&s;timates, relating to the admini&s;tra|tion of the revenues, &s;hould communicate them to John Faidy, or his attornies; that the magi&s;trates of the town, di&s;tricts, and commonalties, as well as tho&s;e who directed the admini&s;tration of particu|lar &s;tates and provinces, &s;hould deliver to the &s;aid John Faidy, or his attornies, the produce of &s;ix years of the duties and revenues belonging to the &s;aid towns, di&s;tricts, and provinces, reckoning from the fir&s;t of January in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty one, together with an authentic account of the &s;ums they had paid during that term to the preceding &s;overeign, and of the charges ne|ce&s;&s;arily incurred. It appears, from the nature of this decree, which was dated on the eighteenth day of October, that immediately after the conventions of Clo&s;ter-&s;even and Bremeworden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Six days after the con|vention was &s;igned at Clo&s;ter|&s;even, another act of accom|modation was concluded at Bremeworden, between the generals Sporcken and Ville|mur, relating to the relea&s;e of pri&s;oners, and &s;ome other points omitted in the conven|tion.</NOTE>, the court of Ver&s;ailles had determined to change the govern|ment and &s;y&s;tem of the electorate, contrary to an expre&s;s article of the capitulation granted to the city of Hanover, when it &s;urrendered on the ninth day of Augu&s;t; and that the crown of France in|tended to take advantage of the ce&s;&s;ation of arms,

With what regard to ju&s;tice, then, could the French go|vernment charge the elector of Hanover with the infraction of articles? or what re&s;pect to good faith and humanity did the duke de Richelieu ob&s;erve, in the order i&s;&s;ued from Zell, towards the end of the year, importing, that as the treaty made with the country of Hanover had been rendered void by the violation of the articles &s;igned at Clo&s;ter-&s;even, all the effects belonging to the officers, or others, em|ployed in the Hanoverian army, &s;hould be confi&s;|cated for the u&s;e of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty?</P>

The l&mdash;of H&mdash;C&mdash;l had been fed with the good things of England, even in time of peace, when his friend&s;hip could not avail, nor his aver|&s;ion prejudice the intere&s;ts of Great Britain: but he was retained in that &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity as a friend, on who&s;e &s;ervices the mo&s;t implicit depen|dence might be placed in any future &s;torm or com|motion. How far he merited this confidence and favour, might have been determined by reflecting on his conduct during the la&s;t war: in the cour&s;e of which his troops were hired to the king of Great Britain and his enemies alternately, as the &s;cale of convenience happened to preponderate. Since the commencement of the pre&s;ent troubles, he had acted as a mercenary to Great Britain, al|though he was a principal in the di&s;pute, and &s;tood connected with her de&s;igns by &s;olemn treaty, as well as by all the ties of gratitude and honour: but now that the cau&s;e of Hanover &s;eemed to be on the decline, and his own dominions had &s;uffered by the fate of the war, he not only appeared willing to abandon his benefactor and ally, but even &s;ued to be inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of his adver&s;ary. This intended defection was however, prevented by a &s;udden turn&punc;of fortune, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee; and his troops continued to act in con|junction with the Hanoverians.</P>

<P>"I know you too well to doubt that the &s;ituation in which we &s;tand at pre&s;ent, with re&s;pect to each other, gives you abundance of unea&s;ine&s;s; nor will you doubt that it gives me equal concern: indeed it a$$licts me greatly. Mean while I could never, my deare&s;t bro|ther, have believed that you would be the per&s;on who &s;hould carry away from me my elde&s;t &s;on. I am exceedingly mortified to find my&s;elf under the hard nece&s;&s;ity of telling you that this &s;tep is contrary to the law of nations, and the con|&s;titutions of the Empire; and that, if you per&s;i&s;t in it, you will di&s;grace your family, and bring a &s;tain upon your coun|try, which you pretend to &s;erve. The hereditary prince, my &s;on, was at Hamburgh by my or|der, and you have carried him to Stade&punc; Could he di&s;tru&s;t his uncle, an uncle who hath done &s;o much honour to his family? Could he believe that this uncle would deprive him of liberty, a liberty never re|fu&s;ed to the lowe&s;t officer? I ordered him to make a tour to Holland: could not the lowe&s;t officer have done as much? Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that my troops, among whom he &s;erved, were to have &s;tayed with the Hanoverians, would it not have been &s;till in my power to give an officer leave of ab&s;ence, or even leave to re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion? and would you hinder your bro|ther, the head of your family, and of &s;uch a family as ours, to exerci&s;e this right with re|gard to a &s;on, who is the here|ditary prince, of who&s;e rights and prerogatives you cannot be ignorant? It is impo&s;&s;ible you could have conceived &s;uch de|&s;igns, without the &s;ugge&s;tion of others. Tho&s;e who did &s;ug|ge&s;t them have trampled on the rights of nature, of na|tions, and of the princes of Germany: they have induced you to add to all the&s;e the mo&s;t cruel in&s;ult on a brother whom you love, and who al|ways loved you with the warm|e&s;t affection. Would you have your brother lay his ju&s;t com|plaints again&s;t you before the whole Empire, and all Europe? Are not your proceedings with|out example? What is Ger|many become? What are its princes become, and out hou&s;e in particular? Is it the intere&s;t of the two kings, the cau&s;e of your country, and my cau&s;e, that you pretend to &s;upport?&mdash;I repeat it, brother, that this de&s;ign could never have been framed by you. I again com|mand my &s;on to pur&s;ue his journey; and I cannot con|ceive you will give the lea&s;t ob&s;truction: if you &s;hould (which I pray God avert) I &s;o|lemnly declare, that I will not be con&s;trained by &s;uch mea|&s;ures, nor &s;hall I ever forget what I owe to my&s;elf. As to my troops, you may &s;ee what I have written on that head to the Hanoverian mini&s;try. The duke of Cumberland, by the convention of Clo&s;ter-&s;even, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and &s;ent them home: the &s;aid mini&s;try gave me notice of this convention, as a treaty by which I was bound. The march of the troops was &s;ettled; and an in|cident happening, they halted: that ob&s;tacle being removed, they were to have continued their march. The court of Hanover will be no longer bound by the convention; while I not only accepted it on their word, but have al&s;o, in conformity with their in&s;truc|tions, negotiated at Ver&s;ailles, and at Vienna. After all the&s;e &s;teps, they would have me contradict my&s;elf, break my word, and entirely ruin my e&s;tate, as well as my honour. Did you ever know your bro|ther guilty of &s;uch things? True it is, I have, as you &s;ay, &s;acrificed my all; or rather, I have been &s;acrificed. The on|ly thing left me is my honour; and, in the unhappy contra&s;t of our &s;ituations, I lament both you and my&s;elf, that it &s;hould be from you, my dear brother, I &s;hould receive the cruel advice to give up my honour. I cannot li&s;ten to it: I cannot recede from my pro|mi&s;e. My troops, therefore, mu&s;t return home, agreeably to what the duke of Cumber|land and the Hanoverian mi|ni&s;try &s;tipulated with regard to me in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. I am afraid that the true circum|&s;tances of things are concealed from you. Not to detain your expre&s;s too long, I &s;hall &s;end you, by the po&s;t, copies of all I have written to the Hanove|rian mini&s;try. It will grieve your hone&s;t heart to read it.

<P>The French court likewi&s;e publi&s;hed a virulent memorial, after the convention of Clo&s;ter-&s;even had been violated and &s;et a&s;ide, drawing an invidious parailel between the conduct of the French king and the proceedings of his Britannic maje&s;ty; in which the latter is taxed with breach of faith, and almo&s;t every meanne&s;s that could &s;tain the charac|ter of a monarch.

He enumerated many in|&s;tances in which &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, encouraged, and even joined the enemies of the electorate, in con|tempt of her former engagements, and directly contrary to the con&s;titution of the empire. He re&s;uted every article of the charge which the French court had brought again&s;t him in their virulent li|bel, reported the imputations of perfidy and ambi|tion, and, with re&s;pect to France, ju&s;tified every particular of his own conduct. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Winter excur|&s;ions.</NOTE></P>

General Hardenberg, another Hanoverian officer, having di&s;lodged the French detachments that occupied Burgh, Vogel&s;ack, and Ritterhude, and cleared the whole territory of Bremen, in the month of January the duke of Broglio a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable corps of troops that were cantoned at Otter&s;burg, Rothenburg, and the adjacent country, and advancing to Bremen demanded ad|mittance, threatning, that in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, he would have recour&s;e to extremities, and puni&s;h the inhabitants &s;everely, &s;hould they make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition.

The enemy were di&s;|lodged from Rottenburg, Otter&s;burg, and Verden, and they abandoned the city of Bremen at the ap|proach of the Hanoverian general, who took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>By this time the court of Ver&s;ailles, being di&s;&s;a|tisfied<NOTE PLACE="marg">The duke de Riche|lieu re|called.</NOTE> with the conduct of the duke de Richelieu, had recalled that general from Germany, where his place was &s;upplied by the count de Clermont, to the general &s;atisfaction of the army, as well as to the joy of the Hanoverian &s;ubjects, among whom Richelieu had committed many flagrant and inhu|man acts of rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion. The new com|mander found his ma&s;ter's forces reduced to a de|plorable condition, by the accidents of war, and di&s;temper ari&s;ing from hard duty, &s;evere weather, and the want of nece&s;&s;aries.

The regency of Hanover were &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his heroic behaviour on this occa&s;ion, that they gratefully acknowledged it in a letter of thanks to him and the count de Clermont; and on the day of &s;olemn thank&s;giving to heaven, for their being delivered from their enemies, the clergy in their Sermons did not fail to celebrate and extol the cha|rity and benevolence of the duke de Randan.

Towards the latter end of February, prince Ferdi|nand of Brun&s;wic, having received intelligence that the count de Chabot was po&s;ted with a con&s;iderable body of troops at Hoya upon the We&s;er, detached the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wic with four batta|lions, and &s;ome light troops and dragoons, to di&s;|lodge them from that neighbourhood.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French army re|treats to the Rhine.</NOTE> After the reduction of this city, the combined army advanced towards Hamelen, where the French general had e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters: but he abandoned them at the approach of the allies, and leaving behind all his &s;ick and wounded, with part of his magazines, retired without halting to Pader|born, and from thence to the Rhine, recalling in his march the troops that were in Embden, Ca&s;&s;el, and the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e, all which places were now evacuated. They were terribly harra&s;&s;ed in their retreat by the Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, and a body of light hor&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Ha|noverian hunters, who took a great number of pri&s;oners, together with many baggage waggons, and &s;ome artillery. Such was the precipitation of the enemy's retreat, that they could not find time to de&s;troy all their magazines of provi&s;ion and fo|rage; and even forgot to call in the garri&s;on of Vechte, a &s;mall fortre&s;s in the neighbourhood of Diepholt, who were made pri&s;oners of war, and here was found a complete train of battering can|non and mortars.</P>

In the beginning of June the whole army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, on a bridge con&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion, defeated a body of French cavalry, and obtained divers other advantages in their march towards We&s;el. Kai|&s;er&s;worth was &s;urprized, the greater part of the garri&s;on either killed or taken; and prince Fer|dinand began to make preparations for the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French army re|inforced.</NOTE> The court of Ver&s;ailles, though equally morti|fied and confounded at the turn of their affairs in Germany, did not &s;it tamely and behold this re|ver&s;e; but exerted their u&s;ual &s;pirit and expedi|tion in retrieving the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained.

He a&s;&s;igned the command of the whole left wing, con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen battalions and twenty-eight &s;quadrons, to lieutenant-general Sporcken: the conduct of the right wing, com|po&s;ed of &s;ixteen battalions and fourteen &s;quadrons, was intru&s;ted to the hereditary prince and major-general Wangenheim; the &s;quadrons, with the addition of two regiments of Pru&s;&s;ian dragoons, were under the immediate d rection of the prince of Hol&s;tein, while the hereditary prince com|manded the infantry.

Prince Ferdinand's de&s;ign was to attack the enemy on their left flank; but the exe|cution was rendered extremely difficult by the woods and ditches that embarra&s;&s;ed the route, and the numerous ditches that inter&s;ected this part of the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their left wing de|feated at Crevelt.</NOTE> On the twenty-third day of June, at four in the morning, the army began to move; the right ad|vancing in two columns as far as St. Anthony, and the left marching up within half a league of Cre|velt. The prince having viewed the po&s;ition of the enemy from the &s;teeple of St. Anthony, procured guides, and having received all the nece&s;&s;ary hints of information, proceeded to the right, in order to charge the enemy's left flank by the villages of Wor&s;t and Anrath; but, in order to divide their attention, and keep them in &s;u&s;pence with re&s;pect to the nature of his principal attack, he directed the generals Sporcken and Oberg to advance again&s;t them by the way of Crevelt and St. Anthony, and, in particular to make the mo&s;t of their artillery, that, being employed in three different places at once, they might be prevented from &s;ending any reinforcement to the left, where the chief attack was intended. The&s;e precautions being taken, prince Ferdinand putting him&s;elf at the head of the grenadiers of the right wing, continued his march in two columns to the village of Anrath, where he fell in with an advanced party of the French, which, after a few di&s;charges of mu&s;que|try, retired to their camp and gave the alarm.

The action began about one in the af|ternoon, with a &s;evere cannonading on the part of prince Ferdinand, which, though well &s;upported, proved ineffectual in drawing the enemy from their cover: he therefore determined to di&s;lodge them from the wood by dint of &s;mall arms. The here|ditary prince immediately advanced with the whole front, and a very ob&s;tinate action en&s;ued. Mean while the cavalry on the right, in vain, attempted to penetrate the wood on the other &s;ide, where the enemy had rai&s;ed two batteries, which were &s;u&s;|tained by forty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e. After a terri|ble fire had been maintained on both &s;ides till five in the afternoon, the grenadiers forced the intrench|ments in the wood, which were lined by the French infantry. The&s;e giving way abandoned the wood in the utmo&s;t di&s;order; but the pur&s;uit was check|ed by the conduct and re&s;olution of the enemy's cavalry, which, notwith&s;tanding a dreadful fire from the artillery of the allies, maintained their ground, and cove ed the foot in their retreat to Nuys. The &s;ucce&s;s of the day was, in a good mea&s;ure, owing to the artillery on the left and in the centre, with which the generals Sporcken and Oberg had done great execution, and employed the attention of the enemy on that &s;ide, while prince Ferdinand pro&s;ecuted his attack on the other quarter. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that their right wing and centre retired in great order to Nuys, though the left was defeated with the lo&s;s of &s;ome &s;tandards, colours, and pieces of cannon, and &s;ix thou&s;and men killed, wounded, or taken

He had formed a plan which would have an&s;wered the&s;e purpo&s;es ef|fectually, and, in execution of it, marched to Ru|remond on the Mae&s;e, when his mea&s;ures were to|tally di&s;concerted by a variety of incidents which he could not fore&s;ee. The prince of Y&s;enbourg was, on the twenty-third day of July, defeated at Sangar&s;hau&s;en by the duke de Broglio, whom the prince de Soubi&s;e had detached again&s;t him with a number of troops, greatly &s;uperior to that which the He&s;&s;ian general commanded.

The He&s;&s;ians, though greatly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> interior in number to the enemy, made a very ob|&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, by favour of a rock in the Fulde that covered their right, and a wood by which their left was &s;ecured. The di&s;pute was &s;o ob&s;tinate, that the enemy's left was obliged to give ground; but the duke of Broglio ordering a fre&s;h corps to advance, changed the fortune of the day. The He&s;&s;ians, overpowered by numbers, gave way; part plunged into the river, where many peri&s;hed, and part threw them&s;elves into the wood, through which they e&s;caped from the pur&s;uit of the hu&s;&s;ars, who took above two hundred &s;oldiers and fifty offi|cers, including the count de Canitz, who was &s;e|cond in command. They likewi&s;e found on the field of battle &s;even pieces of cannon, and eight at Munden: but the carnage was pretty con&s;ider|able, and nearly equal on both &s;ides. The num|ber of the killed and wounded on the &s;ide of the French, exceeded two thou&s;and; the lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ians was not &s;o great. The prince of Y&s;en|bourg having collected the remains of his little army took po&s;t at Eimbeck, where he &s;oon was reinforced, and found him&s;elf at the head of twelve thou&s;and men: but in con&s;equence of this advantage, the enemy became ma&s;ters of the We|&s;er, and opened to them&s;elves a free pa&s;&s;age into We&s;tphalia. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi|nand re|&s;olves to retreat.</NOTE></P>

In his pre&s;ent po&s;ition he was hampered by the French army on one wing, on the other by the fortre&s;s of Gueldre, the garri&s;on of which had been lately reinforced, as well as by divers other po&s;ts, capable of ob&s;truct|ing the convoys and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the combined army: be&s;ies, he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that the prince de Soubi&s;e would endeavour to intercept the Briti&s;h troops in their march from Embden. Induced by the&s;e con&s;iderations he determined to repa&s;s the Rhine, after having offered battle to the enemy, and made &s;everal motions for that pur|po&s;e. Finding them aver&s;e to an engagement, he made his di&s;po&s;itions for forcing the &s;trong pa&s;s of Wach$endonck, an i&s;land &s;urrounded by the Niers, of very difficult approach, and &s;ituated exactly in his rout to the Rhine. This &s;ervice was performed by the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wic, who per|ceiving the enemy had drawn up the bridge, ru&s;hed into the river at the head of his grenadiers, who drove them away with their bayonets, and cleared the bridges for the pa&s;&s;age of the army to|wards Rhinebergen. At this place prince Ferdi|nand receiving intelligence, that Mr. de Chevert, re|puted one of the be&s;t officers in the French &s;ervice, had pa&s;&s;ed the Lippe with fourteen battalions and &s;everal &s;quadrons, to join the garri&s;on of We&s;el, and fall upon lieutenant-general Imhoff, who com|manded a detached corps of the combined army at Meer, that he might be at hand to guard the bridge which the prince had thrown over the Rhine at Rees.

Of this he had no &s;ooner repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, than his advanced guards were engaged with the enemy, who marched to the attack from We|&s;el, under the command of lieutenant-general de Chevert, con&s;i&s;ting of the whole corps intended for the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp.

Perceiving them engaged in that diffi|cult ground, he po&s;ted one regiment in a coppice, with orders to fall upon the left flank of the ene|my, which appeared quite uncovered; and as &s;oon as their fire began, advanced with the re&s;t of his

That this officer might be able to give him a proper reception, prince Ferdinand detached ge|neral Oberg with ten thou&s;and men to Lip&s;tadt, from whence, &s;hould occa&s;ion require, they might continue their march, and join the He&s;&s;ians. The whole body, when thus reinforced, did not exceed twenty thou&s;and men, of whom general Oberg now a&s;&s;umed the command; whereas the troops of Sou|bi&s;e were increa&s;ed to the number of thirty thou|&s;and.

While one part of his troops were engaged in this &s;ervice, he him|&s;elf at the head of another advanced to the ea&s;tern frontier of Bohemia, and &s;ent a detachment as far at Trautenaw, garri&s;oned by a body of Au&s;trians, who, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, abandoned the place, and retreated towards their grand army.

Being &s;till too weak to encounter the Pru&s;&s;ians in the field, he extended his troops in the neighbourhood of the king's army, between Gewitz and Littau, in a mountainous &s;ituation, where he ran little or no ri&s;que of being attacked.

Neverthele&s;s, the king fini&s;hed his fir&s;t parallel; and proceeded with &s;uch vigour as &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;peedy reduction of the place, when his de&s;ign was entirely fru&s;trated by an un|toward incident. Marechal Daun, having received intelligence that a large convoy had &s;et out from Si|le&s;ia for the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, re&s;olved to &s;eize this op|portunity of compelling the king to de&s;i&s;t from his enterprize. He &s;ent general Jahnus with a &s;trong body of troops towards Bahrn, and another detach|ment to Stadtoliebe, with in&s;tructions to attack the convoy on different &s;ides; while he him&s;elf advanced towards the be&s;iegers, as if he intended to give them battle. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, far from being deceived by this feint, began from the motion of the Au&s;trian general to &s;u&s;pect his real &s;cheme, and immediately di&s;patched general Zie|then with a &s;trong reinforcement to protect the convoy, which was e&s;corted by eight battalions, and about four thou&s;and men who had been &s;ick and were ju&s;t recovered. Before this officer joined them, the convoy had been attacked on the twenty-eighth day of June; but the a&s;&s;ailants were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Marechal Daun, however, took care that they &s;hould be immediately reinforced; and next day the attack was renewed with much greater effect.

In&s;tead of retiring into Sile&s;ia, he re&s;olved to avert the war from his own dominions, and take the route of Bohemia, the frontiers of which were left uncovered by marechal Daun's la&s;t motion, when he advanced his quarters to Po&s;nitz, in order to &s;uccour Olmutz the more effectually.

Although his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty had gained an en|tire march upon the Au&s;trians, their light troops, commanded by the generals Buccow and Lau|dohn, did not fail to attend and harra&s;s his army in their retreat; but their endeavours were in a great mea&s;ure fru&s;trated by the conduct and cir|cum&s;pection of the Pru&s;&s;ian commanders. After the rear of the army had pa&s;&s;ed the defiles of Kre|nau, general La&s;ci, who was po&s;ted at Gibau with a large body of Au&s;trian troops, occupied the vil|lage of Krenau with a detachment of grenadiers, who were &s;oon di&s;lodged; and the Pru&s;&s;ians pur&s;ued their march by Zwittau to Leutomy&s;&s;el, where they &s;eized a magazine of meal and forage. In the mean time, general de Ratzow, who conducted the provi&s;ions and artillery, found the hills of Hol|litz po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy, who cannonaded him as he advanced; but marechal Keith coming up, ordered them to be attacked in the rear, and they fled into a wood with precipitation, with the lo&s;s of &s;ix officers and three hundred men, who were taken pri&s;oners. While the marechal was thus em|ployed, the king proceeded from Leutomy&s;&s;el to Konin&s;gratz, where general Buccow, who had got the &s;tart of him, was po&s;ted with &s;even thou|&s;and men behind the Elbe, and in the intrench|ments which they had thrown up all round the city. The Pru&s;&s;ian troops as they arrived pa&s;&s;ed over the little river Adler, and as the enemy had broken down the bridges over the Elbe, the king ordered them to be repaired with all expedition, being de|termined to attack the Au&s;trian intrenchments:

An Au&s;trian $or$s having taken po&s;t between him and Hollitz, in order to ob&s;truct the march of the artillery, he advanced again&s;t them in per&s;on, and having driven them from the place, all his cannon, mili|tary &s;tores, provi&s;ion, with fifteen hundred &s;ick and wounded men, arrived in &s;afety at Konin$ gratz, where the whole army encamped.

They did not however maintain them&s;elves in this part of the country; but, after having ra|vaged &s;ome di&s;tricts, returned to the main body, which halted on the Vi&s;tula, to the no &s;mall di&s;|turbance of the city of Dantzick, where the re&s;i|dent of the czarina actually demanded that the magi&s;trates &s;hould receive a Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on: a demand which they not only peremptorily refu&s;ed, but ordered all the citizens to arms, and took every other method to provide for their defence.

Notwith&s;tanding this lo&s;s, which had greatly di&s;ordered their right wing, they continued to &s;tand their ground; and terrible ha|vock was made among them, not only with the &s;word and bayonet, but al&s;o by the cannon, which were loaded with grape &s;hot, and being exellently &s;erved, did great execution. Towards evening the confu&s;ion among them increa&s;ed to &s;uch a de|gree, that in all probability they would have been intirely routed, had they not been favoured by the approaching darkne&s;s, as well as by a particular operation, which was very gallantly performed. One of the Ru&s;&s;ian generals perceiving the fortune of the day turned again&s;t them, rallied a &s;elect body of troops, and made a vigorous impre&s;&s;ion on the right wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians. This effort diverted their attention &s;o &s;trongly to that quarter, that the right of the Ru&s;&s;ians enjoyed a re&s;pite, during which they retired in tolerable order, and occupied a new po&s;t in the right, where the re&s;t of their forces were the more ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled.

A reinforcement was immediately &s;ent to our piquet-guard in the &s;uburb, amounting, by this junction, to three hundred men, who were &s;oon attacked by the enemy, and the &s;kirmi&s;h la&s;t|ed from four till &s;even o'clock in the evening. During this di&s;pute, we could plainly per|ceive, from our ramparts and church-&s;teeple, &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, mounted on Engli&s;h hor&s;es, reconnoitring our fortification through per|&s;pective gla&s;&s;es. They retired, however, when our cannon began to fire: then our piquet took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their former po&s;t in the &s;uburb; and the reinforcement we had &s;ent from the city returned, after having broke down the bridge over the Oder. Next day count Dohna, who command|ed the army near Frankfort, &s;ent in a reinforcement of four battalions, ten &s;quadrons, and a &s;mall body of hu&s;&s;ars, un|der the command of lieute|nant-general Scherlemmer. The hu&s;&s;ars and a body of dragoons were added to the piquet of the little &s;uburb: the four battalions pitched their tents on the Anger, be|tween the &s;uburb and the for|tification; and the re&s;t of the dragoons remained in the field, to cover the long &s;ub|urb. General Scherlemmer, attended by our governor, co|lonel Schuck, went with a &s;mall party to ob&s;erve the enemy; but were obliged to retire, and were pu$&s;ued by the co&s;&s;acks to the walls of the city. Between four and five o'clock next morning the poor inhabitants were rou&s;ed from their &s;leep by the noi&s;e of the cannon, intermingled with the di&s;mal &s;hrieks and hideous yellings of the co&s;&s;acks be|longing to the Ru&s;&s;ian army. Alarmed at this horid noi&s;e, I a&s;cended the church-&s;teeple, from whence I beheld the whole plain, extending from the little &s;uburb to the fore&s;t, covered with the enemy's troops, and our light hor&s;e, &s;upported by the infantry, en|gaged in different places with their irregulars. At eight I de&s;cried a body of the ene|my's infantry, who&s;e van con|&s;i&s;ted of four or five thou&s;and men, advancing towards the vineyard, in the neighbour|hood of which they had rai&s;ed occa&s;ional batteries in the pre|ceding evening: from the&s;e they now played on our pi|quet guard and hu&s;&s;ars, who were obliged to retire. Then they fired, <HI>en ricochet,</HI> on the tents and baggage of the four battalions encamped on the Anger, who were al&s;o com|pelled to retreat. Having thus cleared the envi$ons, they threw into the city &s;uch a number of bombs and red-hot bullets, that by nine in the morning it was &s;et on fire in three different places; and the &s;treets, being narrow, burned with &s;uch fury, that all our endeavours to extin|gui&s;h it proved ineffectual. At this time the whole atmo|&s;phere appeared like a &s;hower of fiery rain and hail; and the mi&s;erable inhabitants thought of nothing but &s;aving their lives by running into the open fields. The whole place was filled with terror and con&s;ter|nation, and re&s;ounded with the &s;hricks of women and children, who ran about in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction, expo&s;ed to the &s;hot and the bomb-&s;hells, which, bur&s;ting, tore in pieces every thing that flood in their way. As I led my wife, with a young child in her arms, and drove the re&s;t of my children and &s;er|vants half naked before me, tho&s;e in&s;truments of death and deva&s;tation fell about us like hail; but, by the mercy of God, we all e&s;caped un|hurt. Nothing could be more melancholy and affecting than a &s;ight of the wretched people, flying in crouds, and leaving their all behind, while they rent the &s;ky with their lamen|tations. Many women of $i|tinction I &s;aw without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and almo&s;t without cloaths, who had been rou&s;ed from their beds, and run out naked into the &s;treets. When my family had reached the open plain, I endeavoured to return, and &s;ave &s;ome of my effects; but I could not force my way through a mul|titude of people, thronging out at the gate, &s;ome &s;ick and bed-ridden per&s;ons being car|ried on hor&s;eback and in car|riages, and others conveyed on the backs of their friends&punc; through a mo&s;t dreadful &s;cene of horror and de&s;olation.
A great number of families from the open country, and de|fencele&s;s towns in Pru&s;&s;ia and Pomerania, had come hither for &s;helter with their mo&s;t va|luable effects, when the Ru&s;|&s;ians fir&s;t entered the king's territories. The&s;e, as well as the inhabitants, are all ruin|ed; and many&punc; who a few days ago po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable wealth, are now reduced to the utmo&s;t indigence. The neighbouring towns and vil|lages were &s;oon crouded with the people of Cu&s;trin: the roads were filled with objects of mi&s;ery: nothing was &s;een but nakedne&s;s and de&s;pair; nothing heard but the cries of hunger, fear, and di&s;trac|tion. For my own part, I &s;tayed one night at Goltz, and then proceeded for Berlin. Cu&s;trin is now a heap of ruins. The great magazine, the go|vernor's hou&s;e, the church, the palace, the &s;tore and ar|tillery hou&s;es, in a word, the old and new towns, the &s;ub|urbs, and all the bridges, were reduced to a&s;hes: nay, after the arches were de&s;troyed, the piles and &s;terlings were burn|ed to the water's edge. The writings of all the colleges, together with the archives of the country, were totally con|&s;umed, together with a pro|digious magazine of corn and flour, valued at &s;ome millions of crowns. The cannon in the ar&s;enal were all melted; and the loaded bombs and cartridges, with a large quan|tity of gunpowder, went off at once with a mo&s;t horrible explo&s;ion. A great number of the inhabitants are mi&s;&s;ing&punc; &s;uppo&s;ed to have peri&s;hed in the flames, or under the ruins of the hou&s;es, or to have been &s;uffocated in &s;ubterraneous vaults and ca$erns, to which they had fled for &s;afety."</P>
<P>Nothing could be more in|human, or contrary to the practice of a generous ene$y, than &s;uch vengeance wreaked upon the innocent inhabi|tants; for the Ru&s;&s;ians did not begin to batter the forti|fications until all the re&s;t of the place was de&s;troyed. In the cour&s;e of this campaign, the Ru&s;&s;ian co&s;&s;acks are &s;aid to have plundered and burn|ed fourteen large towns and two hundred villages, and $an|tonly butchered above two thou&s;and defencele&s;s women and children. Such mon&s;ters of barbarity ought to be ex|cluded from all the privileges of human nature, and hunted down as wild bea&s;ts, without pity or ce&s;&s;ation. What in famy ought tho&s;e powers to incur, who employ and en|courage &s;uch ruthle&s;s barba|rians!</P></NOTE>. The Pru&s;&s;ian army pa&s;&s;ed the night

The Pru&s;|&s;ian monarch therefore determined to &s;upport him with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. In a few days after the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> battle, he began his march from Cu&s;trin with a re|inforcement of twenty-four battalions and great part of his cavalry; and pur&s;ued his route with &s;uch unwearied diligence, that by the fifth day of September he reached Torgau, and on the eleventh joined his brother. Marechal Daun had po&s;ted him&s;elf at Stolpen to the ea&s;tward of the Elbe, in order to pre&s;erve an ea&s;y communication with the army of the empire encamped in the neighbourhood of Konig&s;tein; to favour the operations of general Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Lu&s;atia to the frontiers of Brandenburgh; to make a diver&s;ion from the &s;outhern parts of Sile&s;ia, where a body of Au&s;trian troops acted under the com|mand of the generals Harrache and De Ville; and to interrupt the communication between prince Henry and the capital of Saxony. On the fifth day of September, the garri&s;on in the &s;trong for|tre&s;s of Konig&s;tein &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri|&s;oners of war, after a very feeble re&s;i&s;tance, to the prince of Deuxponts, who forthwith took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Pirna. When the king of Pru&s;&s;ia therefore arrived at Dre&s;den, he found the army of the empire in this po&s;ition, and mare|chal Daun in a &s;till &s;tronger &s;ituation at Stolpen, with bridges of communication thrown over the Elbe; &s;o that he could not attack them with any pro&s;pect of advantage.</P>

<PB N="355" REF="3660">
yet he afterwards advanced to Rittlitz, that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> might be at hand to &s;eize the fir&s;t favourable oc|ca&s;ion of executing the re&s;olution he had formed to attack the Pru&s;&s;ians. The king, having de|tached general Retzow on his left to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Wei&s;&s;enberg, marched forwards with the body of his army, and po&s;ted him&s;elf in the neighbour|hood of Hochkirchen, after having di&s;lodged the Au&s;trians from that village. Matters were now brought to &s;uch a delicate cri&s;is, that a battle &s;eemed inevitable, and equally de&s;ired by both parties, as an event that would determine whether the Au&s;trians &s;hould be obliged to retreat for winter quarters into Bohemia, or be enabled to maintain their ground in Saxony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">where he is &s;ur|pri&s;ed and defeated.</NOTE> In this &s;ituation marechal Daun re&s;olved to act offen&s;ively, and formed a &s;cheme for attacking the right flank of the Pru&s;&s;ians by &s;urpri&s;e. This mea&s;ure was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by an over&s;ight of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who had neglected to occupy the heights that commanded the village of Hochkir|chen, which was only guarded by a few free com|panies. He determined to take the advantage of a very dark night, and to employ the flower of his whole army on this important &s;ervice, well know|ing that &s;hould they penetrate through the flank of the enemy, the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army would be di&s;concerted, and in all probability intirely ruined. Having taken his mea&s;ures with wonderful &s;ecrecy and circum&s;pection, the troops began to move in the night between the thirteenth and fourteenth of October, favoured by a thick &s;og, which greatly increa&s;ed the darkne&s;s of the night. Their fir&s;t care was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill that com|manded
<PB N="356" REF="3670">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> Hochkirchen, from whence they poured down upon the village, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, after having cut in pieces the free companies there po&s;ted. The action began in this quarter about four in the morning, and continued &s;everal hours with great fury; for notwith&s;tanding the impetuous efforts of the Au&s;trian troops, and the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned among the Pru&s;&s;ians by the &s;urprize, a vigorous &s;tand was made by &s;ome ge|neral officers, who, with admirable expedition and pre&s;ence of mind, a&s;&s;embled and arranged the troops as they could take to their arms, and led them up to the attack, without di&s;tinction of re|giment, place, or precedence. While the action was ob&s;tinately and de&s;perately maintained in this place, amid&s;t all the horrors of darkne&s;s, carnage, and confu&s;ion, the king being alarmed, exerted all his per&s;onal activity, addre&s;s, and recollection, in drawing regularity from di&s;order, arranging the different corps, altering po&s;itions, reinforcing weak po&s;ts, encouraging the &s;oldiery, and oppo&s;ing the efforts of the enemy; for although they made their chief impre&s;&s;ion upon the right by the village of Hochkirchen, marechal Daun, in order to divide the attention of the king, made another attack upon the left, which was with difficulty &s;u&s;tained, and effectually prevented him from &s;ending rein|forcements to the right, where marechal Keith, un|der the greate&s;t di&s;advantages, bore the brunt of the enemy's chief endeavours. Thus the battle raged till nine in the morning, when this gallant officer was &s;hot through the heart. Prince Francis of Brun&s;wic had met with the &s;ame fate: prince Maurice of Anhalt was wounded and taken pri|&s;oner;

and many others were either &s;lain or di&s;a|bled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> As the right wing had been &s;urpri&s;ed, the tents continued &s;tanding, and greatly embarra&s;&s;ed them in their defence. The &s;oldiers had never been properly drawn up in order: the enemy &s;till per&s;evered in their attack with &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rein|forcements and redoubled re&s;olution; and a con&s;i|derable &s;laughter was made by their artillery, which they had brought up to the heights of Hochkirchen. All the&s;e circum&s;tances concurring, could not fail to increa&s;e the confu&s;ion and di&s;a&s;ter of the Pru&s;&s;ians; &s;o that about ten the king was obliged to retire to Dobre&s;chutz, with the lo&s;s of &s;even thou&s;and men, of all his tents, and part of his baggage: nor had the Au&s;trian general much cau&s;e to boa&s;t of his victory. His lo&s;s of men was pretty near equal to that of the Pru&s;&s;ian mo|narch; and, whatever reputation he might have acquired in foiling that enterpri&s;ing prince, cer|tainly his de&s;ign did not take effect in its full ex|tent, for the Pru&s;&s;ians were next day in a condition to hazard another engagement. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had &s;u&s;tained no damage which he could not ea&s;ily repair, except the death of marechal Keith, which was doubtle&s;s an irreparable misfor|tune <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As very little notice was taken, in the detail publi&s;hed by authority, of any part which this great man acted in the battle of Hochkirchen, and a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated in this kingdom, that he was &s;urprized in his tent, naked and half a&s;leep, we think it the duty of a can|did hi&s;torian to vindicate his memory and reputation from the foul a&s;per&s;ion thrown by the perfidious and illiberal hand of envious malice, or el&s;e contrived to &s;creen &s;ome other character from the im|putation of mi&s;conduct. This ta&s;k we are enabled to per|form by a gentleman of can|dour and undoubted credit, who learned the following particulars at Berlin from a per&s;on that was eye-witne&s;s of the whole tran&s;action. Field|marechal Keith, who arrived in the camp the very day that preceded the battle, di&s;ap|proved of the &s;ituation of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and remon|&s;trated to the king on that &s;ubject. In con&s;equence of his advice, a certain general was &s;ent with a detachment to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights that commanded the village of Hochkirchen; but by &s;ome fatality he mi&s;car|ried. Marechal Keith was not in any tent; but lodged with prince Francis of Brun&s;|wic, in a hou&s;e belonging to a Saxon major. When the fir&s;t alarm was given in the night, he in&s;tantly mounted his hor&s;e, a&s;&s;embled a body of the neare&s;t troops, and marched directly to the place that was attacked. The Au&s;|trians had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill which the Pru&s;&s;ian officer was &s;ent to occupy, and this they fortified with cannon: then they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the vil|lage in which the free com|panies of Angenelli had been po&s;ted. Marechal Keith im|mediately conceived the de|&s;ign of the Au&s;trian general, and knowing the importance of this place, thither directed all his efforts. He in per&s;on led on the troops to the at|tack of the village, from whence he drove the enemy; but being overpowered by numbers continually pouring down from the hills, he was obliged to retire in his turn. He rallied his men, returned to the charge, and regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place: be ng again repul&s;ed by fre&s;h rein|forcements of the enemy, he made another effort, entered the village a third time, and, finding it untenable, ordered it to be &s;et on fire. Thus he kept the Au&s;trians at bay, and maintained a de&s;perate conflict again&s;t the flower of the Au&s;trian army, from four in the morning till nine, when the Pru&s;&s;ians were formed, and began to file off in their re|treat. During the whole di&s;|pute he rallied the troops in per&s;on, charged at their head, and expo&s;ed his life in the hotte&s;t of a dreadful fire, like a private captain of grena|diers. He found it nece&s;&s;ary to exert him&s;elf in this man|ner, the better to remove the bad effects of the confu&s;ion that prevailed, and in order to in&s;pirit the troops to their utmo&s;t exertion by his voice, pre&s;ence, and example. Even when dangerou&s;ly wounded, at eight in the morning, he refu&s;ed to quit the field; but continued to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the carnage until nine, when he received a &s;econd &s;hot in his brea&s;t, and fell &s;peechle&s;s into the arms of Mr. Tibay, an Eng|li&s;h volunteer, who had at|tended him during the whole
campaign. This gentleman, who was likewi&s;e wounded, applied to a Pru&s;&s;ian officer for a file of men to remove the marechal, being uncertain whether he was intirely de|prived of life. His reque&s;t was granted; but the &s;oldiers, in advancing to the &s;pot, were countermanded by another of|ficer. He afterwards &s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ubject to one of the Pru&s;&s;ian generals, a Ger|man prince, as he chanced to pa&s;s on hor&s;eback: when Mr. Tibay told him the field|marchal was lying wounded on the field, he a&s;ked if his wounds were mortal: and the other an&s;wering he was afraid they were, the prince &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, and road off without further que&s;tion. The body of this great officer, be|ing thus &s;hamefully abandon|ed, was &s;oon &s;tripped by the Au&s;trian &s;tragglers, and lay expo&s;ed and undi&s;tingui&s;hed on the field of battle. In this &s;ituation it was perceived by count La&s;ci, &s;on of the gene|ral of that name, with whom marechal Keith had &s;erved in Ru&s;&s;ia. This young count had been the marechal's pu|pil, and revered him as his military father, though em|ployed in the Au&s;trian &s;ervice. He recognized the body by the large &s;car of a dangerous wound, which general Keith had received in his thigh at the &s;iege of Ockzacow, and could not help bur&s;ting into tears to &s;ee his honoured ma&s;|ter thus extended at his feet, a naked, lifele&s;s, and de&s;erted cor&s;e. He forthwith cau&s;ed the body to be covered, and interred. It was afterwards taken up, and decently buried by the curate of Hochkir|chen; and, finally, removed to Berlin by order of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who be&s;towed upon it tho&s;e funeral honours that were due to the dignified rank and tran&s;cendent merit of the decea&s;ed; merit &s;o univer&s;al|ly acknowledged, that even the Saxons lamented him as their be&s;t friend and patron, who protected them from vio|lence and outrage, even while he acted a principal part in &s;ubjecting them to the domi|nion of his &s;overeign.</NOTE>.</P>

In the beginning of December, the Pru&s;&s;ian directory of war i&s;&s;ued a decree to the de|puties of the &s;tates of the electorate, demanding a certain quantity of flour and forage, according to the convention formerly &s;ettled; at the &s;ame time &s;ignifying that though the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had hi|therto treated the electorate as a country taken under his &s;pecial protection, the face of affairs was now changed in &s;uch a manner, that for the future he would con&s;ider it in no other light than that of a conquered country. The Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;eized in Pru&s;&s;ia all the e&s;tates and effects belonging to the king's officers: a retaliation was now made upon the effects of the Saxon officers who &s;erved in the Ru&s;&s;ian army.

Great pains were taken to appea&s;e the&s;e clamours; and many were prevailed upon to refer the&s;e grievances to the king in &s;enate: but when this difficulty &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;urmounted, Padhor&s;ki, the nuncio of Vol|hinia, &s;tood up, and declared, that he would not permit any other point to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the dyet, while the Ru&s;&s;ians maintained the lea&s;t footing within the territories of the republic.

On the third day of September the king, according to cu&s;tom, going out in a carriage to take the air, accompanied by one dome&s;tic, was, in the night, at a &s;olitary place near Belem, attacked by three men on hor&s;eback, armed with blunder-bu&s;&s;es, one of whom fired his piece at the coach|man without effect.

<P>The king, being thus di&s;abled in his right arm, i&s;&s;ued a decree, inve&s;ting the queen with the ab&s;o|lute power of government.

But, even &s;hould this interpretation be accepted, the article, and the treaty-it&s;elf, would be &s;uper|&s;eded and annulled by a &s;ub&s;equent treaty, con|cluded between the two nations in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy five, and often confirmed &s;ince that period, &s;tipulating, in a &s;ecret article, That neither of the contracting parties &s;hould give, nor con&s;ent that any of their &s;ubjects and inhabitants &s;hould give any aid, favour, or coun&s;el, directly or indirectly, by land or &s;ea, or on the fre&s;h waters; nor &s;hould furni&s;h, or permit the &s;ubjects or inhabitants of their re&s;pective territories, to furni&s;h any &s;hips, &s;oldiers, &s;eamen, victuals, mo|neys, in&s;truments of war, gunpowder, or any other nece&s;&s;aries for making war, to the enemies of either party, of any rank or condition &s;oever. Now the Dutch have infringed this article in many in&s;tances, during the pre&s;ent war, both in Europe and Ame|rica; and, as they have &s;o openly contravened one treaty, the Engli&s;h are not obliged to ob&s;erve any other. They, moreover, forfeited all right to the ob&s;ervance of the treaty in que&s;t on, by refu&s;ing the &s;uccours with which they were bound, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to furni&s;h the king of Great Britain, in ca&s;e any of his territories in Europe &s;hould be attacked: for nothing could be more weak and frivolous than the allegation upon which
<PB N="395" REF="4070">
this refu&s;al was founded; namely, that the ho&s;ti|lities<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> in Europe were commenced by the Engli&s;h, when they &s;eized and confi&s;cated the ve&s;&s;els of France; and they, being the aggre&s;&s;ors, had no right to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;uccours &s;tipulated in a treaty which was purely defen&s;ive. If this argu|ment has any weight, the treaty it&s;elf can have no &s;ignification. The French, as they did in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, will always commence the war in America; and when their &s;hips, containing rein|forcements and &s;tores for the maintenance of that war, &s;hall be taken on the European &s;eas, perhaps in con&s;equence of their being expo&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e, they will exclaim that the Engli&s;h were the aggre&s;&s;ors in Europe, con&s;equently deprived of all benifit accruing from the defen&s;ive treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the States General of the United Provinces. It being impo&s;&s;ible for the Engli&s;h to terminate the war, while their enemies derive the &s;inews of it from their commerce carried on in neu|tral bottoms, they are obliged to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch col|lu&s;ions, by that nece&s;&s;ity which Grotius him&s;elf hath allowed to be a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for deviating from the letter of any treaty what&s;oever. In time of peace no Dutch &s;hips were permitted to carry the produce of any French &s;ugar i&s;land, or even to trade in any of the French ports in America or the We&s;t-Indies; con&s;equently the treaty which they quote can never ju&s;tify them in carrying on a commerce, which, as it did not exi&s;t, and was not fore&s;een, could not po&s;&s;ibly be guarded again&s;t when that convention was ratified. Grotius, who&s;e authority is held in &s;uch veneration among the Dutch, has determined, that every nation has a

The French i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies were &s;o blocked up by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, that they could receive no relief from their own government, con&s;equently no neutral power could attempt to &s;upply them without fall|ing under this predicament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the reign of king Wil|liam, when the Engli&s;h and Dutch were engaged in a war again&s;t France, the northern powers of Sweden and Den|mark attempted to carry on the French commerce, under the &s;hade of neutrality; but the Dutch and Engli&s;h joined in &s;eizing the ve&s;&s;els that were thus employed. Complaints of the&s;e captures were made at London and the Hague, and the complainants were given to under&s;tand at both places, that they &s;hould not be allowed to carry on any trade with France, but what was u&s;ual in time of peace. In con&s;equence of this decla|ration, Mr. Groning formed the de&s;ign of writing a trea|ti&s;e on the freedom of navi|gation, and communicated the plan of his work to the cele|brated Puffendorf, who &s;igni|fied his &s;entiments in the fol|lowing letter, which is pre|&s;erved by the learned Barbey|rac, in his notes upon that author's treati&s;e on the law of nature and nations.</P>
<P>"The work, Sir, which you have in view, relating to the liberty of navigation, ex|cites my curio&s;ity. It is a cu|rious &s;ubject, which no per&s;on that I know of has yet parti|cularly handled. I very much fear, however, if I may judge from your letter, that you will find people who will di&s;pute your notions. The que&s;tion is certainly one of tho&s;e which have not yet been &s;ettled on any clear or undeniable prin|ciples, &s;o as to afford a gene|ral rule to mankind. In all the examples brought on this &s;ubject, there is a mixture of right and fact. Each nation u&s;ually allows, or forbids, the maritime commerce of neu|tral people with its enemy, either according as it happens to be its intere&s;t to pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e peo|ple, or it finds it&s;elf &s;trong enough to obtain from them what it requires. For exam|ple, the Engli&s;h and Dutch may &s;ay, without ab&s;urdity, that it is lawful for them to do all the mi&s;chief they can to the French, with whom they are at war, and, con&s;equent|ly, to employ the method mo&s;t proper to weaken them, which is to traver&s;e and ruin their trade. They &s;ay it is not rea&s;onable that neutral na|tions &s;hould enrich them&s;elves at their expence, and, by en|gro&s;&s;ing a commerce which the Engli&s;h and Dutch are de|prived of, furni&s;h the French with money to maintain the war. This &s;eems the rather ju&s;t, becau&s;e England and Holland commonly favour the trade of neutral nations, by &s;uffering them to tran&s;port, and &s;ell in foreign markets merchandize of their own growth and manufacture. In &s;hort, they &s;ay that they are willing to leave them in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trade they u&s;u|ally carry on in time of peace; but they cannot &s;ee them take advantage of the war, to ex|tend their commerce to the prejudice of England and Holland; but as this matter of trade and navigation does not &s;o much depend upon rules founded on a general law, as upon conventions made between particular na|tions, &s;o, in order to form a &s;olid judgment of the point in que&s;tion, we ought previ|ou&s;ly to examine what treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the northern crowns on one part, and Eng|land and Holland on the other; and whether the&s;e la&s;t powers have offered the for|mer ju&s;t and rea&s;onable con|ditions. On the other hand, neverthele&s;s, if the northern princes can maintain their trade with France, by &s;ending &s;trong convoys with their fleets, I &s;ee nothing to blame in this practice&punc; provided their ve&s;&s;els have no contraband merchandize on board. The laws of humanity and equity between nations, do not ex|tend &s;o far as to require, with|out any apparent nece&s;&s;ity, that one people &s;hould give up their profit in favour of another. But as the avarice of merchants is &s;o great, that, for the &s;malle&s;t gain, they make no &s;cruple of exceeding the ju&s;t bounds of commerce; &s;o nations that are at war may certainly vi&s;it neutral &s;hips, and if they find prohi|bited goods on board, have a full right to confi&s;cate them. Be&s;ides, I am not at all &s;ur|prized, that the northern crowns have a greater regard to the general intere&s;t of Eu|rope, than to the complaints of &s;ome rapacious merchants, who care not how matters go, provided they can &s;atisfy their thir&s;t of lucre. The&s;e princes wi&s;ely judge, that it is not at all convenient for them to precipitate mea&s;ures, while other nations unite all their forces, to reduce within bounds an in&s;olent and ex|orbitant power which threat|ens Europe with &s;lavery, and the Prote&s;tant religion with ruin. This being the intere&s;t of the northern crowns, it is neither ju&s;t nor nece&s;&s;ary, that, for a pre&s;ent advantage, they &s;hould interrupt &s;uch a &s;alutary de&s;ign, e&s;pecially as they neither incur the &s;malle&s;t expence, nor run the lea&s;t hazard, &amp;c."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manage|ment of the Prin|ce&s;s Re|gent.</NOTE> As far back as the month of June, &s;he pre&s;ented a memorial to the States General, reminding them, that in the beginning of the war between France and England, &s;he had advi&s;ed an augmentation &s;hould be made in their land-forces, to &s;trengthen the garri&s;ons of the frontier towns, and cover the territories of the republic from inva&s;ion. She gave them to under&s;tand, that the provinces of Gueldres and Overy&s;&s;el, intimidated by the proxi|mity of two formidable armies, had re&s;olved to de|mand, that the augmentation of their land-forces &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration by the other provinces; and reque&s;ted her to reinforce their &s;o|licitations that this mea&s;ure might immediately take place. This reque&s;t, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he the more readily granted, as &s;he could not but be &s;en&s;ible of the imminent danger that threatened the republic, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Hanoverian army had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine; and as it behoved the &s;tate to put it&s;elf in a condition to hinder either army from retiring into the territories of the republic, if it &s;hould be de|feated; for, in that ca&s;e, the conqueror being au|thorized to pur&s;ue his enemy wherever he can find him, would bring the war into the heart of their country. This repre&s;entation had no other effect than that of &s;u&s;pending the mea&s;ure which each

The prince&s;s, in her an&s;wer to the fourth depu$ation of the merchants, declared that &s;he beheld the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their trade with the mo&s;t anxious concern; that its want of protection was not her fault, but that of the towns of Dort, Haarlem, Am&s;terdam, Torgau, Rotterdam, and the Brille, to who&s;e conduct it was owing, that the forces of the &s;tate, by &s;ea and land, were not now on a better footing. The deputies were afterwards referred to her mini&s;ter Mr. de la Larrey, to whom they repre&s;ented, that the augmentation of the land forces, and the equipment of a fleet, were matters as di&s;tinct from each other as light from darkne&s;s: that there was no pre&s;&s;ing motive for an augmentation of the army; whereas, innumera|ble rea&s;ons rendered the equipment of a fleet a matter of the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity. In a few days after this repre&s;entation was made, the prince&s;s, in an a&s;&s;embly of the States General, reque&s;ted their High Mightine&s;&s;es, that &s;eeing their earne&s;t and repeated efforts to induce the provinces of Hol|land, Zealand, Frie&s;land, and We&s;t-Frie&s;land, to acquie&s;ce in the propo&s;ed augmentation of forces by &s;ea and land, had not hitherto met with &s;ucce&s;s, they would now con&s;ider and deliberate upon &s;ome expedient for terminating this affair, and the &s;ooner the better, in order, on one hand, to &s;atisfy the &s;trong and well-grounded in&s;tances made by the provinces of Gue$dres, Utrecht, Overy&s;&s;el, and Groningen; and, on the other, to comply with the ardent ju&s;t de&s;ires expre&s;&s;ed by the com|mercial inhabitants of the country.

With|out making any particular remarks on the ha|rangue, &s;he only ob&s;erved, that the drift of it did not tend to facilitate the negociation begun with Great Britain, nor to induce the nation to prefer a convention to a rupture with that crown. From this circum&s;tance &s;he inferred, it was more than time to fini&s;h the deliberations on the propo&s;al for augmenting the forces both by &s;ea and land; a mea&s;ure, without which &s;he was convinced in her con&s;cience the &s;tate was, and would always remain, expo&s;ed to all &s;orts of misfortune and danger, both now and hereafter.</P>

They ob&s;erved, that an augmentation of the land-forces, for the defence of the frontiers, was unavoidable, as well as an equipment by &s;ea for the &s;ecurity of com|merce: that the &s;tates of the provinces of Guel|dres, Utrecht, Overy&s;&s;el, and Groningen, joined with them in the &s;ame opinion; and accordingly had in&s;i&s;ted, by divers letters and propo&s;itions, on tho&s;e two points &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the public intere&s;t.

<P>It was undoubtedly the duty of all, who wi&s;h|ed well to their country, to moderate the heat and precipitation of tho&s;e, who, provoked by their lo&s;&s;es, and &s;timulated by re&s;entment, endea|voured at this period to involve their nation in a war with Great Britain. Had matters been pu&s;hed to this extremity, in a few months the republic would, in all probability, have been brought to the brink of ruin. The Dutch were di&s;tracted by internal divi&s;ions; they were altogether unpro|vided for ho&s;tilities by &s;ea; the ocean was covered with their trading ve&s;&s;els; and the naval arma|ments of Great Britain were &s;o numerous and pow|erful, as to render all re&s;i&s;tance on that element equally vain and pernicious.

Con&s;idering the agitation naturally produced among the com|mon people, by the practice of pre&s;&s;ing men into the &s;ervice of the navy, which in the beginning of the year, had been carried on with unu&s;ual vio|lence; the levy of &s;o many new corps of &s;oldiers, and the endeavours u&s;ed in forming the national mili|tia, very few di&s;turbances happened to interrupt the internal repo&s;e of the nation. From private acts of malice, fraud, violence, and rapine, no community what&s;oever is exempted. In the month of April, the temporary wooden-bridge over the Thames, built for the conveniency of carriages and pa&s;&s;engers, while the workmen &s;hould be em|ployed in widening and repairing London-Bridge, was maliciou&s;ly &s;et on fire in the night, and con|tinued burning till noon next day, when the ruins of it fell into the river.

Even after a new temporary bridge was erected, another attempt was made (in all probability by the &s;ame incendiary) to reduce the whole to a&s;hes, but happily mi&s;carried; and a guard was appointed to prevent any &s;uch atrocious efforts in the &s;equel.</P>

The corre&s;pondence was managed by his brother, a Je|&s;uit, who acted as chaplain and &s;ecretary to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague. The Briti&s;h re|&s;ident at that court, having learned from the Spa|ni&s;h mini&s;ter &s;ome &s;ecrets relating to England, even before they were communicated to him from the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, was induced to &s;et on foot an inquiry touching the &s;ource of this information; and &s;oon received an a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;ecretary of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador had a brother, a phy&s;i|cian, at London. The &s;u&s;picion, naturally ari&s;ing from this circum&s;tance, being imparted to the mi|ni&s;try of England, Hen&s;ey was narrowly watched, and twenty-nine of his letters were intercepted.

In the cour&s;e of this year the public began to enjoy the benefit of &s;everal admirable in&s;titu|tions.

The duke, in compliance with this &s;trange remon&s;trance, appeared at the time and place appointed, on hor&s;eback and alone, with pi&s;tols before him, and the &s;tar of his order di&s;|played, that he might be the more ea&s;ily known. He had likewi&s;e taken the precaution of engaging a friend to attend in the Park at &s;uch a di&s;tance, however, as &s;carce to be ob&s;ervable. He continued &s;ome time on the &s;pot without &s;eeing any per&s;on he could &s;u&s;pect of having writ the letter, and then rode away; but chancing to turn his head, when he reached Hyde-Park corner, he perceived a man &s;tanding at the bridge, and looking at the water, within twenty yards of the tree which was de|&s;cribed in the letter. He forthwi h rode back at a gentle pace, and pa&s;&s;ing by the per&s;on, expected to be addre&s;&s;ed; but as no advance of this kind was made, he, in repa&s;&s;ing, bowed to the &s;tranger&punc; and a&s;ked if he had not &s;omething to communicate. The man replying, "No, I don't know you;" the duke told him his name, adding, "Now you know me, I imagine you have &s;omething to &s;ay to me." But he &s;till an&s;wered in the negative, and the duke rode home. In a day or two after this tran&s;|action another letter was brought to him, couched in the following terms: "My lord, you receive this as an acknowledgment of your punctuality, as to the time and place of meeting on Sunday la&s;t, though it was owing to you it an&s;wered no pur|po&s;e.

<P>The duke determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to unveil this my&s;tery, repaired to the Abbey at the time pre&s;cribed, and after having walked up and down for five or &s;ix minutes, &s;aw the very &s;ame per&s;on, to whom he had &s;poke in Hyde-Park, enter the Abbey with another man of a creditable appear|ance. This la&s;t, after they had viewed &s;ome of the monuments, went into the choir, and the other turning back, advanced towards the duke, who ac|co&s;ting him, a&s;ked if he had any thing to &s;ay to him, or any commands for him? He replied, "No, my lord, I have not." "Sure, you have," &s;aid the duke; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his denial. Then the duke leaving him, took &s;everal turns in the i&s;le, while the &s;tranger walked on the other &s;ide. But nothing further pa&s;&s;ed between them; and al|though the duke had provided &s;everal per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e to apprehend the delinquent, he forbore giving the &s;ignal, that, notwith&s;tanding appearances, he might run no ri&s;que of injuring an innocent per&s;on.

<P>The expre&s;&s;ion, "you will &s;ee me again &s;oon&punc; as it were, by accident," plainly pointed at the per&s;on to whom he had &s;poke in the Park, and in the Abbey; neverthele&s;s he &s;aw him not again, nor did he hear any thing farther of the affair for two months, at the expiration of which the po&s;t brought him the following letter: "May it plea&s;e your grace, I have rea&s;on to believe that the &s;on of one Barnard, a &s;urveyor in Abingdon-build|ings;

Your &s;incere friend, Anonymous.&mdash;He frequently goes to Storey's Gate coffee-hou&s;e."&mdash;In about a week af|ter this intimation was received, the duke &s;ent a per&s;on to the coffee-hou&s;e to enquire for Mr. Bar|nard, and tell him he would be glad to &s;peak to him. The me&s;&s;age was delivered, and Barnard de|clared he would wait upon his grace next Thur&s;day, half an hour after ten in the morning. He was punctual to his appointment, and no &s;ooner ap|peared then the duke recognized him to be the per|&s;on to whom he had &s;poke in the Park and the Ab|bey. Having conducted him into an apartment, and &s;hut the door, he a&s;ked, as before, if he had any thing to communicate; and was an&s;wered, as formerly, in the negative. Then the duke repeated every circum&s;tance of this &s;trange tran&s;action; to which Barnard li&s;tened with attention and &s;urpri&s;e, yet without exhibiting any marks of con&s;cious guilt or confu&s;ion. The duke ob&s;erving, that it was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee letters of &s;uch im|port written with the correctne&s;s of a &s;cholar, the other replied, that a man might be very poor and very learned at the &s;ame time.

innocent man, be &s;uppo&s;ed to know at what time<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> it was written. The duke having made him ac|quainted with the particulars, told him, that if he was innocent he ought to u&s;e his endeavour$ to detect the writer of the letters, e&s;pecially of the la&s;t, in which he was expre&s;ly named. To this admonition he returned no other an&s;wer but a &s;mile, and then withdrew.&mdash;He was afterwards taken into cu&s;tody, and tried at the Old Bailey, for &s;ending a threatening letter, contrary to the &s;tatute; but no evidence could be found, to prove the letters were of his hand-writing; nor did any pre&s;umption appear again&s;t him, except his being in Hyde-Park, and in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, at the time and place appointed in the two fir&s;t letters. On the other hand, Mr. Barnard proved, that on the Sunday, when he &s;aw the duke in Hyde-Park, he was on his way to Ken&s;ington, on particular bu|&s;ine&s;s, by his father's order, &s;ignified to him that very morning: that he accordingly went thither, and dined with his uncle, in company with &s;everal other per&s;ons, to whom he related what had pa&s;&s;ed between the duke of Marlborough and him in the Park; that his being afterwards in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey was the effect of mere accident: that Mr. James Greenwood, his kin&s;man, who had lain the proceding night at his father's hou&s;e, de&s;ired him to dre&s;s him&s;elf, that they might walk together in the Park; and he did not comply with his reque&s;t $word$ after much &s;olicitation: that he propo&s;ed to en|ter the Park without pa&s;&s;ing through the Abbey; but was prevailed upon by Mr. Greenwood, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the newly erected monu|ment of general Hargrave: that as he had former|ly

It like|wi&s;e appeared, from undoubted evidence, that Barnard had often mentioned openly, to his friends and acquaintance, the circum&s;tances of what pa&s;&s;ed between him and the duke in the Park and in the Abbey: that his father was a man of unblemi&s;hed reputation, and in affluent circum&s;tances: that he him&s;elf was never reduced to any want, or &s;uch exigence as might impel him to any de&s;perate me|thods of obtaining money: that his fidelity had been often tried, and his life always irreproachable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he was acquitted of the crime laid to his charge, and the my&s;tery remains to this day undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>After all, the author of the letters does not &s;eem to have had any real de&s;ign to extort money, be|cau&s;e the &s;cheme was very ill calculated for that purpo&s;e, and, indeed, could not po&s;&s;ibly take effect, without the mo&s;t imminent ri&s;que of detection. Perhaps his aim was nothing more than to gratify a petulance and peculiarity of humour, by alarming the duke, exciting the curio&s;ity of the public, puz|zling the multitude, and giving ri&s;e to a thou&s;and ridiculous conjectures. If any thing more was in|tended, and the duke earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know the extent of the &s;cheme, he might, when he clo|&s;etted

On the whole, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that the death of the duke, which happened in the cour&s;e of this year, was never attributed to the &s;ecret practices of this in|cendiary corre&s;pondent, who had given him to un|der&s;tand, that his vengeance, though &s;low, would not be the le&s;s certain.</P>

He ob|&s;erved, that France had al&s;o been made &s;en&s;ible, that whil&s;t her forces are &s;ent forth to invade and ravage the dominions of her neighbours, her own coa&s;ts are not inacc$&s;&s;ible to his maje&s;ty's fleets and armies: a truth which &s;he had experienced in the demolition of the works at Cherburg erected at a great expence, with a particular view to annoy Eng|land, as well as in the lo&s;s of a great number of &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els: but no treatment, however in|jurious to his maje&s;ty, could tempt him to make retaliation on the innocent &s;ubjects of that crown. He told them, that in Germany his maje&s;ty's good brother the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, had found full employment for the armies of France and her confederates, from which the Engli&s;h operations, both by &s;ea and in Ame|rica, had derived the mo&s;t evident advantage; their &s;ucce&s;&s;es owing, under God, to their able con|duct, and the bravery of his maje&s;ty's troops, and tho&s;e of his allies, having been &s;ignal and glorious. The king, moreover, commanded them to declare, that the common cau&s;e of liberty and independency was &s;till making noble and glorious efforts again&s;t the unnatural union formed to oppre&s;s it: that the commerce of his &s;ubjects, the &s;ource of national riches, had, by the vigilant protection received

In this &s;tate of things, he &s;aid, the king, in his wi&s;dom, thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e many words to per|&s;uade them to bear up again&s;t all difficulties, ef|fectually to &s;tand by and defend his maje&s;ty, vi|gorou&s;ly to &s;upport the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the re&s;t of his maje&s;ty's allies, and to exert them&s;elves to reduce their enemies to equitable terms of ac|commodation. He ob&s;erved to the hou&s;e of com|mons, that the uncommon extent of this war, in different parts, occa&s;ioned it to be uncommonly expen&s;ive: that the king had ordered them to de|clare to the commons, that he &s;incerely lamented, and deeply felt for the burdens of his people: that the &s;everal e&s;timates were ordered to be laid before them; and that he de&s;ired only &s;uch &s;up|plies as &s;hould be requi&s;ite to pu&s;h the war with advantage, and be adequate to the nece&s;&s;ary &s;er|vices. In the la&s;t place, he a&s;&s;ured them the king took &s;o much &s;atisfaction in that good harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among his faithful &s;ubjects, that it was more proper for him now to thank them for it, than to repeat his exhortation to it: that this union&punc; nece&s;&s;ary at all times, was more e&s;pecially &s;o in &s;uch critical conjunctures; and his maje&s;ty doubted not but the good effects the nation had found from it, would be the &s;tronge&s;t motives to them to pur&s;ue it.</P>

An a&s;&s;ertion the mo e extraordinary, as the B&mdash;m&mdash;, in their an&s;wer to the Parallel, which we have already mentioned, had expre&s;ly affirmed, that "none but &s;uch as are unacquainted with the maritime force of England, can believe, that without a diver&s;ion on the conti|nent, to employ part of the enemy's force, &s;he is not in a condition to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, and main|tain her &s;uperiority at &s;ea.&mdash;That they mu&s;t be very ignorant, indeed, who imagine that the forces of England are not able to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of France, un|le&s;s the latter be hindered from turning all her ef|forts to the &s;ea." It is very remarkable, that the B&mdash;m&mdash;&s;hould declare, that the war in Ger|many was favourable to the Engli&s;h operations by &s;ea, and in America; and, almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath, accu&s;e the French king of having fomented that war. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that France had no war to maintain in Europe; and a&s;k in what manner &s;he, in that ca&s;e, would have oppo&s;ed the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms by &s;ea, and in America? Her navy was reduced to &s;uch a condition, that it dur&s;t not quit her harbours: her merchant-&s;hips were all taken, her mariners confined in England, and the &s;ea was covered with the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers: in the&s;e circum&s;tances, what expedients could &s;he have con|trived for &s;ending &s;upplies and reinforcements to

But granting that the war in Germany had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, diverted the attention of the French mi|ni&s;try from the pro&s;ecution of their operations in America, (and this is granting more than ought to be allowed) the que&s;tion is not, whether the ho&s;tilities upon the continent of Europe have pre|vented France from &s;ending a great number of troops to Canada; but whether the war in Germany was either nece&s;&s;ary or expedient, for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the French more effectually in other parts of the world?

The ex|pence incurred by England for &s;ub&s;idies and armies in the empire, exceeds three millions &s;terling annu|ally; and this enormous expence, without being able to protect Hanover, has only &s;erved to keep the war alive in different parts of Germany. Had one half of this &s;um been employed in augment|ing and extending the naval armaments of Great Britain, and in reinforcing her troops in America and the We&s;t-Indies, France would have been, at this day, deprived of all her &s;ugar colonies, as well as of her &s;ettlements on the continent of America; and being ab&s;olutely cut off from the&s;e &s;ources of wealth, would have found it impracticable either to gratify her &s;ub&s;idiaries, or to maintain &s;uch for|midable armies to annoy her neighbours.

<P>"Mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign,</P>
<P>"We your maje&s;ty's m$st dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects, the lords &s;piritual and temporal in parliament a&s;&s;embled, beg leave to approach your throne, with hearts full of their duty and affection to your <HI>&s;acred per&s;on and government,</HI> which become the mo&s;t faithful &s;ub|jects to the be&s;t of kings. That con&s;tant regard and <HI>at|tention, which your maje&s;ty has &s;hewn to the honour and intere&s;t of your kingdoms,</HI> have filled our minds with the mo&s;t grate|ful &s;entiments; and we &s;ee with real &s;atisfaction, tho&s;e active and vigilant efforts, which your maje&s;ty, <HI>in your great wi&s;dom,</HI> has made to carry on the war with vigour, in order to the de&s;irable end, which we all wi&s;h, a &s;afe and honourable peace. Ju&s;tice and good policy required, that our enemies &s;hould feel, how dangerous it is for them to provoke the &s;pirit and &s;trength of the Briti&s;h nation. We ac|knowledge, with becoming thankfulne&s;s, the goodne&s;s of the Divine Providence, in having crowned your maje&s;|ty's mea&s;ures and arms with &s;ucce&s;s in &s;everal parts; and we joyfully congratulate your maje&s;ty on the conque&s;t of the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Loui&s;|bourg, with the i&s;lands of Cape-Breton and St. John, the taking of Frontenac, and the reduction of Senegal. The high importance of the&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es is apparent, in the re|putation thereby acquired to your maje&s;ty's arms, and in the di&s;tre&s;s <HI>they cannot fail to bring</HI> upon the French com|merce and colonies, as well as in the happy effects pro|cured to tho&s;e of Great Bri|tain. We have &s;een, with the warme&s;t emotions of re|&s;entment, the exorbitant de|va&s;tations committed by the armies of France upon the dominions of your maje&s;ty, and tho&s;e of your allies in Germany. They mu&s;t now have experienced how much, in con&s;equence of their un|bounded ambition to invade their neighbours, their own coa&s;ts are expo&s;ed in the de|molition of their expen&s;ive works at Cherbourg, particu|larly intended for the annoy|ance of this country; and in the lo&s;s of &s;o many &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, as well privateers as others, in their ports. At the &s;ame time, we cannot &s;uf|ficiently admire your maje&s;ty's <HI>magnanimity and moderation,</HI> in not having hitherto retaliated on the innocent &s;ubjects of that crown, the injurious treatment which you have re|ceived. <HI>We have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the real advantages derived to the operations of Great Britian in particular,</HI> as well as to the common cau&s;e in general, from the wi&s;e conduct of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick. Their great abilities, and the bravery of your maje&s;ty's troops, and tho&s;e of your al|lies, have been &s;ignally con|&s;picuous in the &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which they have been attend|ed, and mu&s;t be acknow|ledged by all Europe. No|thing can po&s;&s;ibly be of great|er national importance than the navigation and commerce of your &s;ubjects; and we return your maje&s;ty our duti|ful thanks for that protection and &s;ecurity which they have received from your royal care, in the di&s;po&s;ition of your flect, to which their pre&s;ent flouri&s;h|ing condition is &s;o much ow|ing. The &s;tagnation of our enemy's trade, and the taking and de&s;troying &s;o many of their capital &s;hips of war, ought, in this view, to be reckoned among&s;t the mo&s;t happy events.&mdash;Permit us to declare our grateful &s;en&s;e of that paternal tenderne&s;s which your maje&s;ty has expre&s;&s;ed for the burthens of your people: we receive from thence the &s;tronge&s;t encouragement to adhere the more firmly <HI>to the cau&s;e of the prote&s;tant religion,</HI> and public liberty, again&s;t any unnatural union formed to oppre&s;s it. In this ju&s;t cau&s;e we will, to our utmo&s;t, effec|tually &s;tand by and defend your maje&s;ty; <HI>&s;upport the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the re&s;t of your al|lies;</HI> and vigorou&s;ly exert our|&s;elves to reduce our enemies to equitable terms of accommo|dation. Our duty and fidelity to your maje&s;ty, and our zeal for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in your royal family, are uniform and unalterable: our prayers for the prolongation of your precious life, and au&s;picious reign over us, are &s;incere and fervent; and we beg leave to give your maje&s;ty the &s;trong|e&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that nothing &s;hall be wanting on our part to improve union and good harmony among&s;t all your &s;ubjects, for promoting and &s;ecuring the&s;e intere&s;ting and e&s;&s;ential objects."</P>

<P>EXPERIENCE having but too well &s;hewn how far the king of Pru&s;&s;ia carries his evil intentions, in order to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of his neighbours; and that prince having on the one hand repeatedly invaded and laid wa&s;te the domi|nions of her maje&s;ty the queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and on the other &s;ide alarmed his maje&s;ty the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, by divers menaces, warlike preparations, and violently pa&s;&s;ing through his territories, for which it has not been po&s;&s;ible to obtain due &s;atisfaction for time pa&s;t, nor &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the future; it has been con&s;idered that this double end cannot be obtained till the &s;aid formidable neighbour is reduced within narrow bounds. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, his maje&s;ty the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, as an auxiliary ally, and her maje&s;ty the queen of Hungary and Bohemia, as a party attacked and at war, have agreed, by the pre&s;ent &s;eparate and &s;ecret act, to employ their joint ef|forts, not only to perform fully the act pa&s;&s;ed between their maje&s;ties the 6/17 of May, 1744, and the mea&s;ures concerted in con&s;equence of the engagements entered into by their treaty of alliance the 8th of January, 1745, with the mari|time powers; but likewi&s;e, that neither the one nor the other &s;hall lay down their arms, till, be&s;ides the conque&s;t of all Sile&s;ia and the county of Glatz, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia be farther reduced.</P>
<P>And that they may previou&s;ly under&s;tand one another, with regard to the partition of the conque&s;ts to be made, &s;ee|ing the 8th article of the &s;aid treaty of War&s;aw only &s;ettled in general terms, that his maje&s;ty the king of Poland, elector of Saxony, is to partake of the advantages, by having &s;uch territories as lie convenient for him; it has appeared nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h the ca&s;es that may hereafter happen, and to come to a right under&s;tanding about each of them.</P>

Her Roman Imperial maje&s;ty, in Bohe|mia, Moravia, and the adjacent countries of Hungary: and her Ru&s;&s;ian Imperial maje&s;ty in Livonia, E&s;tonia, and other neighbouring places, thirty thou&s;and men at lea&s;t, namely, twenty thou&s;and foot, and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, in &s;uch man|ner, that whenever the ca&s;e of an ho&s;tile attack from Pru&s;&s;ia, upon either of the parties &s;hall exi&s;t, the &s;aid thirty thou|&s;and men may, within two months at farthe&s;t, or at the ut|mo&s;t three months, after a previous amicable requi&s;ition, march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the party attacked.</P>
<P>And whereas it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that &s;ixty thou&s;and men will not be &s;ufficient, to repel an ho&s;tile attack, to re-conq$er the ce&s;&s;ions made by the peace of Dr$&s;den, and to &s;ecure the public tranquillity more effectually for the time to come; the two contracting parties have therefore farther engaged them|&s;elves to each other, that in the ca&s;e afore&s;aid, not only thirty thou&s;and men, but double that number, viz. Sixty thou&s;and men, that is to &s;ay, forty thou&s;and foot and twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e, &s;hall be employed for that purpo&s;e by each contracting party; and that, the &s;ooner the better; both their &s;aid Imperial maje&s;ties obliging them&s;elves, to that end, to a&s;&s;emble re&s;pectively, the &s;aid number of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, as &s;peedily, as the di&s;tance of the lea&s;t remote parts, from whence the troops can be drawn, will po&s;&s;ibly admit. The troops to be appointed for that purpo&s;e, on the part of her Ru&s;&s;ian Imperial maje&s;ty, &s;hall be employed, as well by land as by water, according as the occa&s;ions &s;hall then be found mo&s;t proper; but on the part of her Roman Imperial ma|je&s;ty, they &s;hall be employed by land only; in &s;uch a man|ner, that the &s;aid troops may in the beginning, as mutual conveniency &s;hall allow, and after previous concert, make a diver&s;ion, at one and the &s;ame time, in the &s;aid king of Pru&s;|&s;ia's dominions; and, afterwards, if po&s;&s;ible, unite and carry on the operations with combined force. But previou&s;ly to &s;uch junction, and at the beginning of the diver&s;ion to be un|dertaken, there &s;hall be pre&s;ent at each army, a general offi|cer, expre&s;ly appointed by the two contracting parties, as well for the &s;ake of coun&s;el, and concert about the execution of the operations, as for giving the nece&s;&s;ary intelligence, and to be an eye-witne&s;s of the operations &s;o to be executed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Re&s;olutions and In&s;tructions for the Count de <HI>Vicedom,</HI> and the Sieur de <HI>Pezold,</HI> at St. <HI>Peter&s;burgh.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A circum&s;tantial report having been duly made to the king, of the contents of the la&s;t di&s;patches, dated April 18, 19, and 23d, from his privy coun&s;ellor and mini&s;ter plenipoten|tiary at the Imperial court of Ru&s;&s;ia, the count de Vicedom, and from his re&s;ident at the &s;ame court, the privy coun&s;ellor of the emba&s;&s;y, &s;ieur de Pezold, brought hither from Peter&s;|burgh, by the courier Con&s;oli, the 6th of December, and his maje&s;ty having e&s;pecially taken into con&s;ideration the affair of acce&s;&s;ion, in&s;tantly demanded of him by the two Impe|rial courts, to their new defen&s;ive treaty of alliance and its &s;eparate and &s;ecret articles &s;igned at Peter&s;burgh the 22d May 1746, and afterwards ratified by both parties, his maje&s;ty has thought fit to provide the above&s;aid two mini&s;ters in Ru&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="440" REF="4530">
with the following heads of re&s;olution and in&s;truction, which are to &s;erve them as a rule to direct their negociation and conduct in this equally important and delicate affair.</P>
<P N="1">1. The high-chancellor of Ru&s;&s;ia having given them to un|der&s;tand, and al&s;o intimated the &s;ame here by his brother the grand mar&s;hal, that the two Imperial courts would be very glad to have the affair of the king's acce&s;&s;ion treated and con|cluded pre$erably at Petersburgh, as being the place where the defen&s;ive treaty of alliance in que&s;tion, renewed between them, was negociated, concluded, and &s;igned; his maje&s;ty, in order to comply therewith, does for this purpo&s;e provide the count de Vicedom and the &s;ieur de Pezold with the an|nexed full power, together with the clau&s;e&punc; <HI>jointly and &s;eparate|ly,</HI> to the end that in ca&s;e of ab&s;ence, ind$$po&s;ition, or other hindrance of either of them, the other may continue the ne|gociation by conferring neverthele&s;s together and acting in perfect concert.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are to make a merit of this the king's &s;teadine&s;s, by ob&s;erving to the high chancellor and the amba&s;&s;ador P$et|lack, that it is an undoubted proof of his maje&s;ty's &s;incere inclination and attachment to the two empre&s;&s;es, pre&s;erably to all other con&s;iderations that might induce him to proceed more warily in an affair of this extent and con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the re&s;ident Pezold is be&s;t acquainted with what pa&s;|&s;ed near two years ago between the two courts, when the king found him&s;elf within the ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity to claim the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Ru&s;&s;ia, by virtue of their defen&s;ive treaty of alliance renewed again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and the &s;aid re&s;ident having been an eye-witne&s;s of the indifferent, flow, and in|&s;ufficient manner in which they an&s;wered at the court of Pe|tersburgh the reiterated requi&s;itions of his maje&s;ty, to which procedure Saxony ought chiefly to attribute its late di&s;a&s;ters; he will do well to put the high chancellor count de Be&s;tucheff particularly in mind of it, not &s;o much by way of reproach|ing him with it, but rather upon the foot of confidential re|flections, and to make him acknowledge, that it is indeed a very generous re&s;olution in the king to yield &s;o readily to the de&s;ires of the two Imperial courts; and that after what lately happened to him from the Ru&s;&s;ian court, nothing but his maje&s;ty's great confidence in him, the high chancellor, and his pre&s;ent credit and power, could &s;o &s;oon have deter|mined him for the acce&s;&s;ion, in hopes that this principal mi|ni&s;ter will think of repairing what is pa&s;t, by taking his mea|&s;ures &s;o well and &s;o early, that the king may hereafter, in
<PB N="441" REF="4540">
ca&s;e of need, be not only &s;uccoured in time and &s;ufficiently, but al&s;o that his maje&s;ty, on the occa&s;ions of reciprocal a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, may find his account, indemnification, and real ad|vantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to the principal treaty between the two Imperial courts, the king is entirely di&s;po&s;ed to accede thereto, with|out any other re&s;triction than that of the number of troops, which they have reciprecally &s;tipulated therein, for the ordi|nary ca&s;es of giving &s;uccours; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that his maje&s;ty's plenip&punc;ten$$aries propo&s;e and in&s;i&s;t, that the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance he is to have, be &s;ettled, in the act of acce&s;&s;ion, at double the &s;ucc$ur promi&s;ed from the electorate of Saxony, ina&s;much as the court of Vienna &s;ends to the king, and main|tains at its own charge, in all the ca&s;es, the reciprocal &s;uc|cours of 6 and 12000 men.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the count de Vicedom and the &s;ieur de Pezold &s;hall have &s;ettled this with the mini&s;ters of the two contracting courts, they &s;hall al&s;o proceed to treat of the king's acce&s;|&s;ion to the &s;ix &s;eparate articles, five of which are &s;ecret, and require much more reflection and adju&s;tment with regard to the king's conveniency.</P>
<P N="6">6. However, as his maje&s;ty, through inclination and zeal for the common intere&s;t and the public good, is not aver&s;e to co-operate therein as far as po&s;&s;ible, and in proportion to his forces, his plenipotentiaries mu&s;t take particular care to ex|plain them&s;elves on this head more &s;pecially, with tho&s;e of the two Imperial courts, to the end that their demands, and the king's conde&s;cen&s;ion in each article, may be combined with his maje&s;ty's intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="7">7. There being among the articles, &s;ome points of en|gagements which properly concern none but the two Impe|rial courts principally contracting; they &s;hall endeavour to obtain that the king be not included therein, or that they be attempered for his maje&s;ty, as al&s;o that every future war in Italy be excepted, as it is already in the treaty with the court of Vienna.</P>
<P N="8">8. The fir&s;t and fourth of the &s;ecret articles being the mo&s;t difficult and onerous, if the king accedes to them in their &s;en&s;e and extent, the two Imperial courts cannot take it ami&s;s that his maje&s;ty de&s;ires, be&s;ides more proportion in the en|gagements, that they may contain reciprocal conditions and advantages.</P>
<P N="9">9. As to the fir&s;t &s;ecret article, which concerns the gua|ranty of the grand duke of Ru&s;&s;ia's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as duke of
<PB N="442" REF="4550">
Hol&s;tein-S$e&s;wick, and of his ducal hou&s;e, the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider how tenderly and cautiou&s;ly the king mu&s;t behave towards the court of Denmark, on ac|count of his affinity and right of eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and therefore the &s;aid &s;overeign, as well as the Empre&s;s-queen, and even the Emperor her con&s;ort, will not, in return, re&s;u&s;e the king and his po&s;terity the guaranty of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Denmark, which in time may fall to a prince of the electeral hou&s;e of Saxony.</P>
<P N="10">10. In fine, as to the fourth article, which regards even|tual and &s;tronger mea&s;ures again&s;t a new, &s;udden, and unex|pected attack from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the king acknow|ledges therein the p$udent foreca&s;t of the two empre&s;&s;es, in thinking before-hand how to concert matters together and powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;t one another&punc; if, contrary to better expecta|tions, and notwith&s;tanding their icrupulous attention to ob|&s;erve their treaties with the &s;aid prince, the latter &s;hould in|vade the dominions of either of them; and in this ca&s;e the king is ready enough to concur in the &s;ame mea&s;ures: but as he is the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of &s;o formidable and re&s;tle&s;s a neighbour, witne&s;s the &s;ad experience his ma|je&s;ty has lately had of it, their Imperial maje&s;ties cannot think it &s;trange that the king, before entering into &s;uch a new, eventual, and exten&s;ive engagement, &s;hould take better pre|cautions, as well for his &s;ecurity and mutual defence, as for his being inde$$nified, and recompen&s;ed in proportion to his efforts and the progre&s;s made again&s;t &s;uch an aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P N="11">11. To this end the count de Vicedom and the &s;icur Pe|z$ld &s;hall a&s;k the Imperial mini&s;ters plenipotentiaries, 1&punc; What number of troops, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, their &s;overeigns de|&s;ire of the king; and, in return, with how many each of them will a&s;&s;i&s;t him? And zdly, That this &s;uccour de&s;ired of the king be not di&s;proportionate to the &s;trength of his army. 3. That the two Imperial courts mu&s;t promi&s;e double the number to the king. 4. That the two empre&s;&s;es mu&s;t each engage to keep at lea&s;t &s;uch a body of their troops in a move|able condition and ready to march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ma|je&s;ty, one upon the frontiers of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the other in Bo|hemia. 5. That they likewi&s;e oblige them&s;elves to let the king come in for a &s;hare of the pri&s;oners, &s;poils, and con|que&s;ts they &s;hall make jointly, or &s;eparately, on the aggre&s;&s;or, and thereby the common enemy.</P>
<P N="12">12. With re&s;pect to this la&s;t point, and the partition of the conque&s;ts to be made, the king's mini&s;ters plenipoten|tiaries
<PB N="443" REF="4560">
are to a&s;k the Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter what his &s;overeign's offers are; and to declare, relatively to the Empre&s;s-queen of Hungary and Bohemia, that &s;uppo&s;ing this prince&s;s were attacked again by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and &s;hould recover not only Sile&s;ia and the county of Glatz, but likewi&s;e &s;uc|ceed in reducing that agg$e&s;&s;or within narrower bounds, the king of Poland, as elector of Saxony, would abide by the partition &s;tipulated between her and his maje&s;ty by the con|vention &s;igned at Leip&s;ic the 18th of May 1745, a copy of which the re&s;ident Pezold received enclo&s;ed in a letter from the mini&s;try of the 14th of November following; except|ing the third degree of par$ition defined therein, with which his maje&s;ty cannot be &s;atisfied; &s;ince in ca&s;e the Empre&s;s-queen &s;hould be able to conquer, be&s;ides the county of Glatz and all Sile&s;ia, no more than the principality of Cro&s;&s;en with the circle of Zullichau, and the fie&s;s of Bohemia po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in Lu&s;atia, it would be nece&s;|&s;ary to grant eventually to the king, elector of Saxony, a more con&s;iderable &s;hare in tho&s;e conque&s;ts than the &s;aid prin|cipality, the circle, and the fiefs: his maje&s;ty will wait for the offers of the court of Vienna on this head, and will order the count de Loo&s;s to negotiate thereupon, wi&s;hing only that the Ru&s;&s;ian court would u&s;e its good offices to ob|tain, in this ca&s;e, a better partition for the king from the Empre&s;s-queen, and then &s;ecure and guaranty to his maje&s;ty the acqui&s;ition thereof.</P>
<P N="13">13. The count de Vicedom and the Sieur Pezold are to take <HI>ad referendum</HI> all that may be &s;aid to them in an&s;wer to the premi&s;es, and not to conclude any thing, until, in con|&s;equence of their reports, they &s;hall be authori&s;ed to do it by the king's final order and re&s;olutions.</P>
<P N="14">14. The re&s;t is left to their prudence, dexterity, and zeal for the &s;ervice, intere&s;t, and glory of his maje&s;ty, who a&s;|&s;ures them of his protection and good graces, whil&s;t they ap|ply them&s;elves to fulfil, with all the exactne&s;s they are ca|pable of, the points of this in&s;truction.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Memorial pre&s;ented by the <HI>Saxon</HI> Mini&s;ters at <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> the &frac12;&frac45; <HI>September, 1747.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the conference held with us the underwritten, the 8th and 19th in&s;tant, we have indeed already exhibited our full powers, as al&s;o the declarations and conditions upon which his maje&s;ty the king of Poland, our mo&s;t gracious ma&s;ter, as elector of Saxony, is ready to accede to the defen&s;ive treaty of alliance concluded between the two Imperial courts at Pe|tersburg the 22d of May, 1746, as al&s;o to the &s;ecret and &s;e|parate articles of the &s;ame treaty, according to the orders and in&s;tructions we have received on this head.</P>
<P>But as their excellencies the mini&s;ters of the two Imperial courts, impowered to confer with us, were de&s;irous of having &s;omething from us in writing, we would not fail to give the following &s;ummary.</P>
<P N="1">I. His Poli&s;h maje&s;ty very readily and gratefully acknow|ledges the friend&s;hip which the two Imperial courts have been plea&s;ed to &s;hew him, in communicating to him the &s;aid treaty, with the &s;eparate and &s;ecret articles, and inviting him to accede thereto; but, at the &s;ame time, he flatters him&s;elf, that having &s;o many important rea&s;ons to ab&s;tain in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is from all new engagements, the two high contracting parties will look upon the facility, which his ma|je&s;ty expre&s;&s;es on this occa&s;ion, as a fre&s;h proof of his &s;incere friend&s;hip and perfect confidence, and that they will be there|by &s;o much the more inclined to &s;ettle the &s;aid acce&s;&s;ion on &s;uch a foot, that his maje&s;ty may not only be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with|out lo&s;s of time, and &s;ufficiently, whenever the ca&s;e exi&s;ts, but that he may likewi&s;e have a &s;uitable indemni|fication and real advantages for his reciprocal and real con|currence.</P>
<P N="2">II. In this confidence his maje&s;ty is ready to accede purely to the body of the treary, adding thereto this re&s;triction only, That in return for the number of auxiliary troops which his maje&s;ty, as elector of Saxony, &s;hall oblige him&s;elf to furni&s;h, the two Imperial courts do &s;tipulate double the number for him, according to the example &s;et in the en|gagements already &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-queen of Hungary and Bohemia. As for the particular number of troops to be furni&s;hed by our court,
<PB N="445" REF="4580">
we have orders to wait on this head the fir&s;t overtures from the two high contracting parties. However we think, &s;ee|ing that the &s;uccours which &s;hould be mutually furni&s;hed in the ordinary ca&s;es, on which the body of the treaty turns, is already determined by the treaties which his maje&s;ty has already made with the two courts; one might al&s;o abide by it in the pre&s;ent acce&s;&s;ion, and be content with making this &s;erve to confirm preceding engagements.</P>
<P N="3">III. Circum&s;tances being very different with re&s;pect to the &s;eparate and &s;ecret articles, the fir&s;t and fourth of which e&s;pecially de&s;erve a much more &s;erious attention; we are in|&s;tructed, as to the fir&s;t article, which regards the guaranty of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his imperial highne&s;s the grand duke of Ru&s;&s;ia, as duke of Hol&s;tein-Schle&s;wick, in Germany, to repre&s;ent the great care and caution with which his ma|je&s;ty is obliged to manage in regard to the Court of Den|mark, in con&s;ideration of the ties of blood, and of the even|tual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that is due to him; and to propo&s;e, for this rea&s;on, that in return for the &s;aid guaranty which his ma|je&s;ty is to take upon him&s;elf, he &s;hould have the guaranty of the two high contracting parties, as al&s;o that of the Em|peror, for the abovementioned right of eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Denmark, and that this right be in the mean time acknowledged.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As for the fourth article, his maje&s;ty entirely approves of the wi&s;e and efficacious mea&s;ures which the Imperial courts have eventually taken, in ca&s;e that his maje&s;ty the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, notwith&s;tanding the exact ob&s;ervation of the peace concluded with him, &s;hould again attack in a ho&s;tile man|ner the dominions of either party, and he is ready to con|cur therein. But as his maje&s;ty has many more rea&s;ons than the two Imperial courts to think maturely of it, and ought above all things to con&s;ider, that according to the &s;ad expe|rience he has lately had, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia took a pretext from the &s;uccours he was obliged to furni&s;h to her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-queen of Hungary and Bohemia, to declare war again&s;t him; that, moreover, the electorate of Saxony is by its &s;ituation &s;o much expo&s;ed to his re&s;entment, that, if it were not immediately a&s;&s;i&s;ted, it could not po&s;&s;ibly with|&s;tand by its own forces, &s;uch &s;udden attacks as have been executed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and, in fine, if provi&s;ion be not fir&s;t made for the &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation of the &s;aid electorate, the two high contracting parties would them|&s;elves be infinitely prejudiced by the ruin of this &s;tate. In
<PB N="446" REF="4590">
con&s;equence of the&s;e con&s;iderations, his maje&s;ty flatters him|&s;elf that the two high contracting parties them&s;elves will acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity and ju&s;tice of the conditions and modifications which we are charged to propo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That the number of auxiliary troops, which they &s;hall require of his maje&s;ty, be not di&s;proportionate to the &s;trength of his army. 2. That each of the two Imperial courts promi&s;e double that number to his maje&s;ty; and, if this were not &s;ufficient, that the &s;uccour be yet farther increa&s;ed. 3. That the two Empre&s;&s;es do each of them engage to keep&punc; at lea&s;t, &s;uch a body of their troops in a condition to move, and in readine&s;s to march to his maje&s;ty's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, on the one &s;ide on the frontiers of Pru&s;&s;ia, and on the other in Bohemia. 4. That the&s;e bodies of troops do make a diver&s;ion in the countries neare&s;t at hand, the moment that the territories of Saxony &s;hall be attacked, or war declared again&s;t the electo|rate; and this mu&s;t be done without requiring the formality of a previous concert, notwith&s;tanding what is &s;tipulated on this head in the body of the treaty, as well as in the &s;ecret article. 5. That in ca&s;e one of the two Imperial courts &s;hould be attacked, his maje&s;ty be not obliged to commence the operations before the other Imperial court has effectively begun to act, in order to avert the effect of the enemy's &s;uperiority, or at lea&s;t till the evident danger of being &s;ud|denly cru&s;hed cea&s;es. 6. That, in con&s;equence of the 10th article of the treaty, they make his maje&s;ty partake not only of the booty and the pri&s;oners, but al&s;o of the conque&s;ts that may be made on the enemy. And in fine, 7. `That as her maje&s;ty the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has declared in the 4th &s;ecret article, that in the ca&s;e of &s;ending &s;uccours, or making a diver&s;ion, &s;he had no de&s;ign to make new conque&s;ts, and con&s;equently it will be indifferent to her how his maje&s;ty agrees with the court of Vienna about the eventual partition and a proper indemnification; her &s;aid Imperial maje&s;ty of Ru&s;&s;ia would therefore be plea&s;ed to approve this convention beforehand, and take upon her to guaranty it.'</P>
<P>As to the fifth &s;eparate article, and the &s;econd, third, and fifth &s;ecret articles, his maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the&s;e articles mu&s;t of cour&s;e be out of the que&s;tion; becau&s;e, on the one hand, the &s;aid articles turn upon engagements which con|cern none but the two Imperial courts; and on the other hand, becau&s;e, in not communicating to his maje&s;ty the mo&s;t &s;ecret article alledged in the third &s;ecret article, they have them&s;elves thereby given to under&s;tand; that the king's
<PB N="447" REF="4600">
concurrence in tho&s;e engagements is not required; and that for the re&s;t, they will abide by what has been anteriorly &s;tipulated in the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between his maje&s;ty and each of the Imperial courts. But as in the third and fifth &s;ecret articles, they have again repeated the exception to the <HI>Ca&s;us Focderis</HI> already laid down in the treaty it&s;elf, with regard to future wars in Italy, and have added thereto, that, on the part of the Empre&s;s-queen, the pre&s;ent war with the hou&s;e of Bourbon, and on the part of her maje&s;ty the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, an ho&s;tile aggre&s;&s;ion on her empire from the &s;ide of the North, are not to be deemed as ca&s;es that may prevent what has been &s;tipulated in the 4th &s;ecret article, with re&s;pect to a rupture on the part of Pru&s;&s;ia; therefore the two high contracting parties will not refu&s;e to include his maje&s;ty likewi&s;e in this &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Finally, the king doubts not but the two Imperial courts will take all the&s;e propo&s;itions as &s;o many proofs of his equity, his confidence, and his &s;incere friend&s;hip; and he flatters him&s;elf &s;o much the more with the hope of receiving a favourable an&s;wer, as he has de&s;erved, by the calamities he has incurred for the common cau&s;e, that for the future his &s;afety and indemnification &s;hould be proportionably better provided for. We the under-written wait for the &s;aid decla|ration and an&s;wer, in order to proceed further in the affair of the acce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>You will no doubt remember, that, as &s;oon as the two Im|perial courts of Vienna and Petersburgh gave me an invita|tion by the counts of E&s;terha&s;y and Be&s;tucheff, to accede to the treaty of defen&s;ive alliance renewed between the two Em|pre&s;&s;es, the 22d of May, 1746, I had cau&s;ed full information to be given you of the in&s;truction on that head &s;ent to my mini&s;ters plenipotentiaries at the Ru&s;&s;ian court, where it was agreed that the affair of my acce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be treated of.

My mini&s;ters at Peter&s;burgh, after having declared, in general terms, my favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards the acce&s;&s;ion, and produced their full powers, always kept them&s;elves in readine&s;s to en|ter upon bu&s;ine&s;s with the mini&s;ters authori&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e by the two Empre&s;&s;es, but had no opportunity to do it &s;ooner than the 8/19 of September la&s;t at a conference; and having then been de&s;ired to give their overtures in writing, they did &s;o by a <HI>pro memoria</HI> &s;igned the &frac12;&frac45; of September, a copy of which (marked A) is hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>"Whereas, until the two Imperial courts make an an&s;wer thereto by their mini&s;ters at Petersburg, and before I do, in con&s;equence of it, come to a final determination in regard to my act of acce&s;&s;ion, it behoves me to come to a right under|&s;tanding with the Empre&s;s-queen about the eventual partition which is to fall to my &s;hare, in ca&s;e that prince&s;s, attacked again, contrary to better expectations, by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;hould, by the concurrence of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, make &s;poils and conque&s;ts on him, as it is more at large explained in the 12th article of the in&s;truction abovementioned, which my mini&s;ters at Petersbugh were provided with the 23d of May, of the pre&s;ent year; I charge you with this negotiation, and autho|rize you by the pre&s;ent order, and my intention is, that as my convention, &s;igned at Leip&s;ick, the 18th of May, 1745, with the queen of Hungary, a copy of which (marked B) you will find hereunto annexed, may &s;erve as an eventual partition hereafter, excepting the third degree, or in ca&s;e the court of Vienna &s;hould be able to recover, be&s;ides the county of Glatz, only all Sile&s;ia, with the principality of Cro&s;&s;en, the circle of Zullichau, and the fiefs of Bohemia, which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia holds in Lu&s;atia, you mu&s;t demand for me, of the Empre&s;s-queen, a more con&s;iderable &s;hare in tho&s;e conque&s;ts than the &s;aid principality, circle, and fiefs, and in&s;i&s;t upon that prince&s;s's making me an offer of it, that I may then &s;ee whether it would &s;uit my conveniency to acquie&s;ce in it."

<P>I added at the &s;ame time, that it would be proper, and the king my ma&s;ter expected it, that in imitation of Ru&s;&s;ia, they would likewi&s;e eventually authorize the re&s;pective mini|&s;ters, who re&s;ide at the courts principally intere&s;ted in main|taining peace, to declare in due time, and &s;uppo&s;ing there &s;hould &s;eem to be a nece&s;&s;ity for it (before which we our&s;elves

<P>In relating the motives which he (Funck) and baron Pret|lach, mini&s;ter from Vienna, had alledged to the Ru&s;&s;ian mi|ni&s;ters, for keeping always a powerful army on the frontiers of Pru&s;&s;ia, he &s;ays he repre&s;ented to them, among other things:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That this precaution was &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;idering the notorious views of the courts of France, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden, in ca&s;e of a vacancy in the throne of Poland, as the king of Pru&s;&s;ia would not then delay executing his de&s;igns upon Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, and on the mouth of the Vi$$ula&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>I doubt not but the court of Ru&s;ia is already informed of the different movements and arrangements which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia is making in the kingdom of that name, with the greate&s;t c$lerity and the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, with re&s;pect to trade, the coin, and e&s;pecially military preparations: I likewi&s;e hope, that court will be the more attentive thereto, as tho&s;e preparations have been &s;pecially ob&s;erved after the great augmentation of troops which the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia lately ordered to be made in her adjacent provinces, and that they &s;eem to be in con&s;equence thereof. I have, however, thought fit to communicate to you the advices on this head, which we have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively received, to the end that you may make u&s;e of them in your conferences with the mini&s;try of the court where you re&s;ide.

<P>I cannot conceal from you a piece of intelligence I have received, concerning a new project of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, to facilitate his views of aggrandizement. It is known that that prince has long been endeavouring to bring the courts of Sweden and Denmark into his intere&s;t. Having failed in the overture he made in Denmark, on occa&s;ion of prolong|ing the &s;ub&s;idiary treaty between that court and France, he is now thinking of other methods to fix the &s;aid court in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The birth of the young grand duke of Ru&s;&s;ia mu&s;t have appeared to him a favourable opportunity to gain that end: for as he imagines that after this event, which &s;ecures the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in the dutchy of Hol&s;tein, the negotiation for ex|changing that dutchy again&s;t the county of Oldenburgh will meet with more difficulties, and that the king of Denmark would not, without great reluctance, drop a project which would give his dominions the compactne&s;s he &s;o much de|&s;ires: 'tis pretended that he has propo&s;ed another plan to the Dani&s;h court, in order to &s;ucceed in his views. We have not yet been able to find out the nature of this plan, nor in what manner he has promi&s;ed to back it, whether it tends to make u&s;e even of violent means, and what he would &s;tipu|late for him&s;elf in return. However, my advices make me conjecture, that he has not forgot in this project the pretext of the Greek religion, which the Grand Duke has embraced, and which is not one of the religions tolerated in the Em|pire; and that he flatters him&s;elf, by this means, to engage therein the Empire, and the guarantees of the peace of We&s;t-phalia.</P>
<P>Though I pretend not to be any way po&s;itive in regard to this project, which, after all, agrees &s;o well with the genius of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and though I am likewi&s;e of opi|nion, that the court of Denmark will not be the dupe of it; the bare idea of &s;uch a project does neverthele&s;s &s;eem impor|tant enough for you to impart it in confidence to the Ru&s;|&s;ian mini&s;try, but &s;till with the nece&s;&s;ary caution, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Letter from Count <HI>Flemming</HI> to Count de <HI>Bruhl.</HI></P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur,</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Klingraeff received la&s;t Saturday an expre&s;s from his court, in con&s;equence of which he &s;ent a note the next morning to count de Kaunitz, earne&s;tly entreating him to ap|point an hour for a conference with him. This note was de|livered to the chancellor of &s;tate, ju&s;t while he was in confe|rence with the mar&s;hals Neuperg and Brown, and general prince Piccolomini. And as he intended to wait upon the Empre&s;s-queen immediately after the conference, in order to make her a report thereof, he &s;ent word to M. Klingraeff, that he was indeed obliged to go to Schoenbrunn, but neverthele&s;s he would be obliged to him if he would ha&s;ten to him that very in&s;tant; which the Pru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter did not fail to do. Count de Kaunitz told me in confidence, at a conver&s;ation I had with him ye&s;terday morning, that M. Klingraeff, on his ac|co&s;ting him, gave him to under&s;tand, with a certain embarra&s;&s;|ment mixed with unea&s;ine&s;s, that he had ju&s;t received an expre&s;s from his court, who brought him &s;ome orders, the contents of which he was to lay before the Empre&s;s-queen in per&s;on, and for this purpo&s;e he was enjoined to demand a private audience of her Imperial maje&s;ty, which he de&s;ired he would be plea&s;|ed to procure for him. That he, count Kaunitz, made an|&s;wer, that being ju&s;t ready to &s;et out for Schoenbrunn, he willingly took upon him to demand the audience he de&s;ired; but could not avoid letting him under&s;tand, that it was pro|per
<PB N="462" REF="4750">
he &s;hould be enabled at lea&s;t, in general terms, to give the Empre&s;s previous notice of the nature of the in&s;inuations he had orders to make to her maje&s;ty. Whereupon M. de Klingraeff told him, that he was charged to demand amicably, and by way of eclairci&s;&s;ement, in the name of the king his ma&s;ter, what was the tendency of the armaments and military preparations making here, and whether they might not, per|haps, concern him; which, however, he could not imagine, as he did not know that he had given the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for them. That he, Kaunitz, replied, that he could not ju&s;t then make any an&s;wer to that overture; that he would not &s;ail to make a report thereof immediately to the Empre&s;s, and procure him the audience he reque&s;ted: That, neverthele&s;s, he could not forbear telling him, that he was &s;urprized at the explanation which the king his ma&s;ter required concerning the mea&s;ures taken in this country, &s;eeing this court had ex|pre&s;&s;ed no unea&s;ine&s;s or umbrage at the great movements and preparations which had been previou&s;ly ob&s;erved in his army. This mini&s;ter farther told me, "That having &s;et out imme|diately after for Schoenbrunn, he had reflected by the way on the an&s;wer he &s;hould advi&s;e his &s;overeign to give M. Klin|graeff; and having thought he perceived that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had two objects in view, which this court was de&s;irous equally to avoid, viz. to come to conferences and eclair|ci&s;&s;ements, that might at fir&s;t cau&s;e a &s;u&s;picion of the mea&s;ures which they judged nece&s;&s;ary to be continued vigorou&s;ly; and &s;econdly, to lead matters further on, to other propo&s;itions and more e&s;&s;ential engagements; he had therefore judged that the an&s;wer ought to be of &s;uch a nature as might en|tirely elude the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's que&s;tion; and that, in leav|ing no more room for further explanations, it &s;hould at the &s;ame time be re&s;olute and polite, without being &s;u&s;ceptible of any interpretation either &s;ini&s;ter or favourable. That pur|&s;uant to this notion, it appeared to him &s;ufficient, that the Em|pre&s;s &s;hould content her&s;elf with &s;imply an&s;wering. That in the violent general cri&s;is Europe was now in, her duty and the dignity of her crown required her to take &s;ufficient mea|&s;ures for her own &s;ecurity as well as for the &s;afety of her friends and allies." That the Empre&s;s-queen had approved of this an&s;wer; and to &s;hew that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;tep and de|mand did not occa&s;ion the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment here, her ma|je&s;ty immediately ordered the hour of M. Klingraeff's audience to be fixed for the next day, which was the day before ye&s;ter|day&punc; and after hearing that mini&s;ter's propo&s;ition, ju&s;t as he
<PB N="463" REF="4760">
had imparted it the preceding day to count de Kaunitz, &s;he had an&s;wered him preci&s;ely in the terms abovementioned, and then &s;uddenly broke off the audience with a nod, without entering into any further detail. It is certain that all Vienna, being then a&s;&s;embled in the Empre&s;s-queen's drawing-room, as it was a day of <HI>galla,</HI> &s;aw M. Klingraeff enter, and depart in a very few minutes, with an embarra&s;&s;ed countenance. I have all the&s;e particulars from the mouth of count de Kau|nitz, who on this occa&s;ion has talked to me with more open|ne&s;s and confidence, than he had hitherto done, and even charged me to make u&s;e of them in my di&s;patches to your excellency, but &s;till with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>It is &s;o much the le&s;s doubted that this an&s;wer, equally &s;trong and ob&s;cure, will greatly puzzle the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and 'tis pretended here, that that prince mu&s;t be under a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, and that he has already drawn three millions of crowns out of his trea&s;ury, for the charges of his preparations and augmentations.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, and not without probability, that his de|&s;ign in the demand abovementioned was, that if he had been an&s;wered, that he him&s;elf had been the cau&s;e of the arma|ments made here, he would have endeavoured to clear him|&s;elf of the charge, by alledging, in proof of his innocence, that for this very rea&s;on he did not even form the camps which he has already traced to exerci&s;e his &s;oldiers, but had ordered the regiments to &s;eparate; perhaps imagining he &s;hould lay this court under a nece&s;&s;ity to follow his example by di&s;continuing likewi&s;e its preparations. However, I think, he will find it no ea&s;y matter to divert it from its de&s;ign by &s;uch illu&s;ions as the&s;e.</P>
<P>We have learned by an expre&s;s who arrived la&s;t Sunday from the count de Peubla, that notwith&s;tanding the feigned di&s;po&s;itions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, his troops &s;till continued filing off towards Sile&s;ia. Be&s;ides, it is very ea&s;ily under&s;tood that that prince, by the local po&s;ition of his army, which he can a&s;&s;emble in as many weeks as it would require months to do the &s;ame here, on account of the di&s;tance of the places where the troops are quartered, has too vi&s;ible an advantage over this court, which he can put to &s;uch great expences by long and continual marches, that they would at la&s;t become intolerable: I &s;ay, it is very readily under&s;tood, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue, without interruption, the mea&s;ures alrea|dy begun, in order to put them&s;elves, in the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, upon equal terms, and in a good condition; that the
<PB N="464" REF="4770">
king of Pru&s;&s;ia may be thereby obliged, to keep up his ar|maments and the augmentations made, and to be made, which exceed his faculties, or wa&s;te him&s;elf gradually; or el&s;e, in order to prevent this inconvenience, to take a preci|pitate re&s;olution; which, I think, is the very &s;ame thing ex|pected from him.</P>
<P>The return of M. Klingraeff's courier, which the &s;aid prince, no doubt, waits for with the utmo&s;t impatience, will give us more light into his di&s;po&s;itions. There is rea&s;on to believe, that if he thinks him&s;elf menaced, he will no longer delay coming to action, and preventing tho&s;e whom he dreads, in order to take advantage of the &s;ituation in which this court will be till the end of the month of Augu&s;t, which is the term when all the troops are to be a&s;&s;embled. But, on the other hand, if he remains quiet, he may be per&s;uaded that he will not be mole&s;ted or atte&s;ted, <HI>at lea&s;t not this year.</HI> However, from all the ob&s;ervations I make, I cannot but imagine, that this court mu&s;t be very &s;ure of the friend&s;hip and attachment of Ru&s;&s;ia. And this &s;eems to me to be farther confirmed by a letter of the 6 D. c. from M. Swart, the Dutch mini&s;ter at Petersburgh, to M. de Burmannia, wherein he writes among other things, that the French emi&s;&s;ary, the chevalier Doug|las, gained ground every day.</P>
<P>As this cannot fail of producing an alteration in the old &s;y&s;tem of Ru&s;&s;ia, it does not appear &s;urpri&s;ing that the high-chancellor count Be&s;tucheff, agreeably to what your excellency did me the honour to write to me in your la&s;t di&s;patch, has re&s;olved to retire into the country, under the pretext of re|covering his health, and to withdraw awhile from public bu&s;i|ne&s;s; as he may be willing to wait what turn affairs may take, and perhaps fore&s;ees that the hour is at hand, &s;ince the whole &s;eems to depend on the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's re&s;olution; it being certain, that if he remains quiet, the court of Vienna will not begin to act neither, at lea&s;t this year: but &s;he will endeavour, during that interval, to fini&s;h her preparations, that &s;he may the next year be in a &s;ituation to take a cour&s;e &s;uitable to the circum&s;tances and events which time may produce.</P>
<P>This confirms me more and more in the opinion which I ventured to take the liberty to communicate to your excel|lency in my former letters, that our court has no &s;urer means to profit by the pre&s;ent conjunctures, which, perhaps, never were &s;o favourable during the reign of our augu&s;t ma&s;ter, than by putting it&s;elf in a good po&s;ture, to the end that its con|currence
<PB N="465" REF="4780">
may be courted. A friend of mine, who pretends to have his information from one of the clerks of the trea&s;ury, a&s;&s;ures me, that this court has remitted a million of florins to Ru&s;&s;ia."</P>
<P>Count de Kaunitz has told me, that the advices which your excellency had conveyed to him of reports &s;pread by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, concerning alliances to be made between him and us, as al&s;o with Ru&s;&s;ia; and, moreover, that this court was taking upon her to mediate between France and England; has already been &s;ent to him by other hands, and con&s;equent|ly de&s;erved the more attention, as well as to be contradicted; which the Empre&s;s-queen's mini&s;ters at the courts of Europe would accordingly be ordered to do. This chancellor of &s;tate further told me, there was advice, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had an intention to &s;urprize the city of Stral&s;und in Swe|di&s;h Pomerania; and that, if this proved true, it was likely to be in con&s;equence of the plot lately di&s;covered at Stock|holm.</P>
<P>If your excellency has an opportunity to make in&s;inuations with &s;afety at the court of London, you might perhaps do it &s;ome &s;ervice by apprizing it of the danger into which it has been led by tho&s;e who now have the greate&s;t influence there.</P>
<P>It will be a hard ta&s;k for that court to get out of the di&s;|tre&s;s, which &s;he has plunged her&s;elf into; and if &s;he does not detach her&s;elf from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by making her peace with France on the be&s;t conditions that can be had, the latter will go on from &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ucce&s;s, and from one pro|ject to another, which in the long run may prove fatal to the hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>I beg it as a favour of your excellency, that you would not de&s;cend to particulars with M. de Broglie about any thing I have the honour to write to your excellency; becau&s;e that amba&s;&s;ador holds a corre&s;pondence with M. d' Aubeterre, who has told me with &s;ome &s;urprize, that the count de Broglie was fully per&s;uaded, that mi&s;chief was intended again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and even accu&s;ed him of di&s;tru&s;t and too much re&s;erve concerning the de&s;igns of the court of Vienna.</P>
<P>The marquis d'Aubeterre having long &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his po&s;t for a few months, in order to attend his family affairs, which require his pre&s;ence at Paris, has at la&s;t obtained his reque&s;t.</P>

<P>To Count de <HI>Flemming</HI> at <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>I take the opportunity of the departure of a courier, &s;ent by count de Sternberg to his court, with the advices which the count de Puebla has lately communicated to him, con|cerning the mighty warlike preparations of the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia, which &s;eem to threaten more and more a rupture on his part.</P>
<P>Your excellency cannot fail of being more particularly and &s;pecially informed of the&s;e advices and dangerous appear|ances, by the mini&s;try of their Imperial maje&s;ties, and I con|tent my&s;elf with tran&s;mitting to you the annexed extract of the la&s;t letter from M. de Bulow, who mentions the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions. Having ju&s;t been di&s;cour&s;ing in confidence on this &s;ubject with count de Sternberg, I am to authori&s;e you, to confer on an object &s;o intere&s;ting to both courts, with the mini&s;try of that court where you re&s;ide; to make them &s;en|&s;ible of the difficulties and dangers to which we &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed, by the pa&s;&s;age of a Pru&s;&s;ian army through Saxony, which our &s;ituation would no way permit us to oppo&s;e, or perhaps by &s;ome ulterior and more &s;ignificative propo&s;ition and demand, which his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty might make on that occa&s;ion; and to engage them to open their mind to us with the utmo&s;t confidence, in regard to the mea&s;ures they intend to pur&s;ue, in order to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from an unju&s;t at|tack, and at the &s;ame time to cover and protect the domi|nions of the king our ma&s;ter, which are again menaced thro' our faithful attachment to our allies.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the la&s;t intent, it would no doubt be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;emble forthwith a &s;ufficient army in the circles of Bohe|mia that are neare&s;t to our frontiers; and it would be equally u&s;eful to the two courts, if her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-queen would be plea&s;ed to order field-mar&s;hal Brown to communi|cate and concert matters, at all events, and with the proper caution and &s;ecrecy, with our field-mar&s;hal count Rutow&s;ki, whom the king has already authori&s;ed for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="4800">
Being per&s;uaded that the court of Vienna finds her own ac|count in our &s;afety and pre&s;ervation, I have explained my&s;elf on all this more at large with the count de Sternberg, who will not fail to give an exact account thereof by the &s;ame courier; and for the re&s;t, I can depend on your penetra|tion, zeal, and addre&s;s, which di&s;pen&s;e with my adding here all the reflections and e&s;&s;ential motives, &s;uitable to this criti|cal &s;ituation, and agreeable to the connections &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the two courts.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWERS of the Court of VIENNA, TO THE PRUSSIAN Declarations, circular Re|&s;cripts, and Memorials.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;One thing remains to be cleared up; this is the great my&s;tery which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia thought proper to re|veal to the public, with a view of ju&s;tifying his precipitant mea&s;ures in infracting the peace.</P>
<P>The &s;poils of the &s;ecret cabinet of Dre&s;den are to afford him the materials, and to &s;upply the want of true <HI>motives</HI> for his antecedent inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>In civil and private affairs it is, indeed, true, that no judge would admit of things, violently taken from the party ac|cu&s;ed, as a legal and good evidence. In political affairs, we have not yet had any &s;uch in&s;tance which might be imitated without prejudice to the law of nations.</P>
<P>But whatever the&s;e proceedings &s;o violent, and never heard of, may come to, the intentions of Pru&s;&s;ia cannot obtain their end by them. There is fir&s;t the chief and mo&s;t mate|rial que&s;tion; "Do the&s;e pieces of corre&s;pondence, &s;o taken and then publi&s;hed in the Pru&s;&s;ian <HI>memorial,</HI> actually and really exi&s;t? And if they do, are their contents truly the &s;ame as related? And, &s;uppo&s;e them to be originals, are they not fal&s;e and &s;uppo&s;itious?"</P>
<P>The&s;e pretended originals are communicated only by way of extracts not duly connected; hence there remains a &s;u&s;|picion, that &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as did not &s;uit the publi&s;her of them, were purpo&s;ely left out, or at lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;ed by &s;ome able hand.</P>
<P>Such, and many other rea&s;onable doubts could be made, and this alone is enough to prevent an ea&s;y belief. It is a matter of &s;urprize to &s;ee the&s;e pieces obtruded upon the pub|lic, from which it was expected that every body would blindly tru&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian compiler to believe them, without exami|ning the allegations.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="4820">
The contents of the <HI>memorial,</HI> when duly examined, mani|fe&s;tly tend to mi&s;lead an inadvertent reader by the mi&s;inter|pretations of tho&s;e pieces, called Ju&s;tifying Proofs, which &s;hew the very contrary of what the Pru&s;&s;ian court affects to have found therein. It is, indeed, hard to find out a rea&s;on, why they were publi&s;hed; there being many things, which the rules of policy ought to have induced the court of Berlin to conceal.</P>
<P>Directly in the preamble of the &s;aid <HI>memorial</HI> its author has committed a manife&s;t blunder by annexing the <HI>act,</HI> or as he &s;tiles it, <HI>The Treaty of Partition,</HI> which, indeed, was entered into by his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty, as elector of Saxony, the 18th of May, 1745, during the late war; and forgetting at the &s;ame time, or wilfully omitting, the <HI>union-project,</HI> delivered to his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty by count Harrach, after the conclu&s;ion of the peace of Dre&s;den: though he is endeavouring to found his whole rea&s;oning upon the renewal of the &s;aid <HI>act</HI> of the year 1745, which is contained therein.</P>
<P>However, the rea&s;on of this artful concealment is not diffi|cult to be gue&s;&s;ed at. He &s;aw that, by the &s;ketch thereof, there would appear the mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;olutions, faithfully and religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve the reiterated conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace, ratified by both parties, which was made the prelimi|nary article to this <HI>union-project.</HI> The re&s;t contained two pro|vi&s;ions, one for time of peace, and the other for a future time of war. Concerning the fir&s;t, it was &s;tipulated that every thing &s;hould go on according to that quite innocent treaty of the 20th of December, 1743, and the <HI>act</HI> of the 13th of May, 1744; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make any objections again&s;t it. In the article concerning a future time of war, proper care was taken, for fear of any mi&s;repre&s;entation, and therefore the following words were made u&s;e of; "But if, notwith&s;tanding the management to be ob&s;erved by the two contracting parties towards Pru&s;&s;ia, and the &s;incerity and faith in fulfilling the treaties concluded, a new interruption of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hed the 25th of December of la&s;t year, &s;hould, on the other hand, be taken, and con&s;equently, <HI>the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances, as they were before the conclu&s;ion of this double peace, lay the parties, according to all the laws both divine and human, under the &s;ame obligation towards each other; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, but neither before, or otherwi&s;e, all &s;hall be e&s;teemed, renewed, and compromi&s;ed, what the &s;ecret convention, &s;igned Dre&s;den, April 29th, and Vienna, May 3d, 1745, is capable of."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="4830">
Who but the author of the above <HI>memorial,</HI> could look up|on &s;uch propo&s;als as of an extraordinary nature? According to the difference of times, different former conventions are propo&s;ed to be renewed; and the mea&s;ures to be taken in a future time of war, are not to bind, nor take effect, until, <HI>ac|cording to all the laws, both divine and human,</HI> the parties were no more bound to peace; and the full right of &s;uch treaties &s;hould not before he entered upon, or avail.</P>
<P>This was the project, and &s;o it remained, as appears, among other things, from the an&s;wer of count Bruhl to count Flem|ming's letter, containing the intimation of count Uhlefeld, dated March 8th, 1753&punc; and in&s;erted among the Pru&s;&s;ian Ju&s;|tifying Proofs, Numb. XIII. where &s;ome other conventional propo&s;itions are mentioned, to which count Bruhl made this an&s;wer; "I am previou&s;ly of opinion, that what was pro|mi&s;ed us in the <HI>declaration</HI> of May 3d, 1745, might &s;erve for the ba&s;is."</P>
<P>The abu&s;e made of this fir&s;t allegation by the Pru&s;&s;ian court, will be a pattern to judge of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Two manife&s;t fal&s;ities betray them&s;elves in a particular manner in the allegation of two letters, Numb. XV. and XVI; one was written by Mr. Weingarten, the amba&s;&s;ador's &s;ecretary, and directed to count Uhlefeld at Vienna: the other is a letter of count Bernes to the Empre&s;s-queen's mi|ni&s;ter at Berlin. It is neither probable or comprehen&s;ible, that &s;uch originals could ever have happened to be put up in the &s;ecret cabinet of Dre&s;den. However, &s;uppo&s;e them to be originals, the fir&s;t of the&s;e letters does not contain any thing prejudicial, but only the truth, concerning the conti|nual military preparations of Pru&s;&s;ia. The &s;econd letter are private thoughts of a mini&s;ter, which his court, on recogni|zance, never would have approved of, but rather cen&s;ured them with indignation.&mdash;</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-queen was very diffe|rent from that of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia: the continual danger of an attack &s;he was in, &s;ince the peace of Dre&s;den, was a real concern. The experience of repeated infractions of the peace, committed by Pru&s;&s;ia, and followed within a few years one by another, left no room to the court of Vienna to expect another fate: for the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was continually arming him&s;elf, and augmenting his forces; though the peace was but lately concluded, and no probability of any danger; the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria being engaged in another war, Ru&s;&s;ia at a
<PB N="471" REF="4840">
great di&s;tance, and Saxony too weak for any enterprize; but Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;o &s;erious in its preparations, as made it hard to di&s;tingui&s;h a time of peace and a time of actual war from each other.</P>
<P>Adding the notorious turbulent temper of the pre&s;ent king, his continual intrigues with foreign courts, his contra|ven&s;ions, his rai&s;ing di&s;putes among his neighbours; nothing could be expected but that he would play his game again the fir&s;t opportunity, and unexpectedly interrupt the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties of peace; by which it would appear, that he only had made peace in order to prepare for another war with re|newed &s;trength.</P>
<P>The Imperial court of Ru&s;&s;ia has no le&s;s intere&s;t in the &s;upport of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, than this hou&s;e in the un|di&s;turbed tranquillity of the Ru&s;&s;ian monarchy, and both courts in the defence of the republic of Poland again&s;t the aggrandizing views of Pru&s;&s;ia, and its intermeddling with the dome&s;tic affairs of this kingdom. Therefore no better me|thod could be taken to provide for the common welfare and future &s;afety, than the union of the two courts, which was effected by the treaty of 1746, obliging each other to unite their &s;trength for &s;etting proper bounds to the overgrown power of Pru&s;&s;ia, if this king, not &s;atisfied with the con&s;i|derable acqui&s;itions he had made, &s;hould again proceed to &s;ome ho&s;tilities again&s;t either of the contracting parties, or the republic of Poland, their ally.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the contents, and the view of the <HI>fourth &s;ecret article</HI> of this <HI>defen&s;ive treaty</HI> of friend&s;hip, concluded at Pe|ter&s;burgh, 1746, to which the Pru&s;&s;ian <HI>memorial</HI> was endea|vouring to give a fal&s;e colour, by pretending it to be <HI>offen|&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P>How was it po&s;&s;ible, in any convention, to u&s;e plainer terms, or more binding expre&s;&s;ions, than were made u&s;e of in this very article? The parties obliging each other to ob&s;erve religiou&s;ly the peace concluded at Dre&s;den with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in every particular, and irrevocably to continue the renunciation and ce&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia and Glatz, without hav|ing any regre&s;s to the rights &s;o renounced, <HI>until it &s;hould hap|pen that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf, by attacking fir&s;t Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, or the republic of Poland, &s;hould make &s;uch a ca&s;e to exi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia therefore had no rea&s;on to take um|brage at this article; the regre&s;s to the rights upon Sile&s;ia and Glatz being only ca&s;ual; for it was in his power, by only omitting ho&s;tilities, to make it void and ineffectual.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="4850">
The <HI>fourth &s;ecret article</HI> of this convention between the two Imperial courts, is a convincing proof that their motives and views, from the beginning, and ten years after, were no more than to procure a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the dange|rous neighbourhood of Pru&s;&s;ia, and to agree before&punc;hand upon proper mea&s;ures to be taken for maintaining the gene|ral repo&s;e, including the republic of Poland, as an ally to both parties by compacts. The far-fetched Pru&s;&s;ian induc|tions and idle in&s;inuations of an offen&s;ive de&s;ign, are there|fore to be looked upon as entirely defeated by the nature of the abovementioned &s;ecret article, and its literal &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the engagements of the two courts by the treaty of Petersburgh, for obtaining this &s;alutary end, had been to &s;end &s;ome &s;uccours, without entering previou&s;ly into a clo&s;e union to &s;tand with their united force again&s;t the ori|ginal di&s;turber of the peace, would not &s;uch mea&s;ures have proved in&s;ufficient, and the execution thereof very dange|rous, or even impo&s;&s;ible? For the &s;tipulated &s;uccours of 60,000 men could not have been &s;ent to &s;uch di&s;tant provinces without weakening the &s;ecurity of frontiers.</P>
<P>The peaceable intentions of the two courts required no more than mutual engagements conditionally entered upon, in ca&s;e Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould make the fir&s;t attack, and again di&s;turb the common peace; which, doubtle&s;s, is a real and true mark to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>defen&s;ive from offen&s;ive alliances.</HI></P>
<P>But the Pru&s;&s;ian writers go a great deal farther, and endea|vour to per&s;uade the public, that a prince is authorized to in|vade his neighbour, only upon a probability and &s;u&s;picion of being in danger to be attacked. If it be &s;o, how can they maintain, that the Empre&s;s-queen could, or ought not to have taken mea&s;ures by a treaty with Ru&s;&s;ia, again&s;t a tur|bulent neighbour, who broke the peace three or four times, unprovoked by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and its allies? Self|pre&s;ervation, which is founded on the principles of the law of nature, pre&s;cribes this rule, "That one ought to be the more circum&s;pect and careful in providing &s;ufficient means, the greater the power is of a di&s;turber, in order to oppo&s;e effec|tually his de&s;igns."</P>
<P>Any power is authorized, beyond controver&s;y, to convene with other powers for pre&s;erving the general tranquillity; and no one can ju&s;tly take offence at, or look upon it as a derogation from his rights. There may be &s;everal circum|&s;tances which require, according to the laws of &s;ociety, that &s;ome number of them &s;hould join hands for this purpo&s;e. If
<PB N="473" REF="4860">
this &s;hould be neglected, and a di&s;turber be &s;ure of never lo&s;ing, but keeping what he has, or what was ceded to him for the &s;ake of peace, or of increa&s;ing his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to ag|grandize him&s;elf at the expence of his neighbours, there would be no living in this world in peace and &s;afety for any &s;tate.</P>
<P>We may remember the famous quadruple alliance conclud|ed, with general approbation, in the year 1718, which per|fectly agrees with our principles abovementioned. The &s;e|venth article, and the third &s;ecret article, as al&s;o the &s;econd article of the acce&s;&s;ion-act of the States-General, February 20, 1732, are particularly to be taken notice of. This alliance being made &s;olely for the maintenance of public tranquillity, will be a &s;ufficient and convincing proof that the two maritime powers, in ca&s;e of an attack, have engaged them&s;elves to a great deal more towards Au&s;tria, than Ru&s;&s;ia has done in the fourth &s;ecret article of the treaty of Peter&s;burg. The article la&s;t mentioned of this quadruple alliance, is compri&s;ed in the following formal expre&s;&s;ions; "But in ca&s;e the auxiliaries abovementioned &s;hould be found in&s;ufficient, in regard to the impendent nece&s;&s;ity, then the contracting parties &s;hall, with|out delay, agree to a more ample &s;upply, and be bound, in order to repel the force of the enemy, and to procure &s;atis|faction, reparation, and full &s;ecurity to the party offended, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, if nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require it, their ally with all their forces, and declare war again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or." The&s;e la&s;t words, undoubtedly, imply all the effects of a declared war on the part of the aiding powers.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia therefore ought not to have taken of|fence at the &s;ecret article of the treaty of Peter&s;burg; for the two contracting parties would never have had it in their power to make u&s;e of it for the recovery of Sile&s;ia, as long as the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had had &s;o much power over him&s;elf as to en|joy the advantages &s;ecured to him by the treaty of Dre&s;den, in peace and quiet; e&s;pecially as in the &s;ame place where this article makes mention of the Pru&s;&s;ian ho&s;tilities, the&s;e remarkable words are added; "In ca&s;e his maje&s;ty the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould, contrary to expectation, and again&s;t our common wi&s;hes, fir&s;t recede from that peace."</P>
<P>And again the following condition, expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, "That the two contracting parties &s;hould do their utmo&s;t to prevent it." And again the&s;e words, "That &s;uch mea&s;ures &s;hould only then, but not before, take place, when their peaceable endeavours were fru&s;trated."</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4870">
Was there ever taken more care to avoid even a mere &s;ha|dow of offence? And yet the Pru&s;&s;ian Memorial in vindication of the conduct of the King, makes bold to interpret that, which was intended to prevent any &s;u&s;picion of an offen&s;ive alliance, as a formal plan of an offen&s;ive convention tending to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the king of Pru&s;&s;ia of Sile&s;ia.&mdash;</P>
<P>The electorate of Saxony has hitherto had the &s;ame rea&s;ons as the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and more too, to be on its guard with the utmo&s;t caution, on account of the dangerous Pru&s;|&s;ian neighbourhood; and, in con&s;equence thereof, to long for aid and deliverance. It was however obliged, on account of its &s;ituation and inferior &s;trength, to keep &s;crupulou&s;ly and with the utmo&s;t care, within the bounds of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian court, at pre&s;ent, accu&s;es the court of Saxo|ny, from its own &s;ecret papers, of no more than an inclina|tion and de&s;ign to accede to the mea&s;ures of Au&s;tria and Ru&s;|&s;ia, and this only in ca&s;e of a Pru&s;&s;ian rupture. But it ap|pears very plainly that the fact, <HI>i. e.</HI> the actual acce&s;&s;ion, did not follow. Witne&s;s all the pretended Ju&s;tifying Proofs, and the Memorial it&s;elf, which does not deny the truth in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It is granted, that the court of Berlin could not po&s;&s;ibly expect any other re&s;olutions from the court of Saxony, con|&s;idering the unneighbourly manner and oppre&s;&s;ions, both in regard to commerce and other provincial affairs Saxony &s;uf|fered from Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ince the late peace. It is no wonder, when &s;uch a conduct has grieved the Saxon mini&s;ters to their heart, and made them &s;peak more freely to others about it; yet the court ought not to be made re&s;pon&s;ible for it, nor the whole country treated cruelly, the effect of which may be felt for a whole century.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who makes this his motive for his pre&s;ent unwarrantable procedures again&s;t Saxony, betrays thereby his exce&s;&s;ive pride; for he &s;eems to imagine him&s;elf the monarch again&s;t whom all the powers make them&s;elves guilty of trea&s;on, and the mo&s;t abominable con&s;piracies, as &s;oon as they entertain but a thought of refu&s;ing the yoke of Pru&s;&s;ian &s;uperiority, or pre&s;uming to withdraw them&s;elves from his puni&s;hing rod.</P>
<P>If a mere intention to oppo&s;e unnatural violences is a &s;uf|ficient charge again&s;t the electoral hou&s;e of Saxony, what can the world judge of &s;uch de&s;igns as never, to this time, tended to prevent violences, but to act arbitrarily again&s;t
<PB N="475" REF="4880">
other powers, and to oppre&s;s all the neighbours? Such are the facts too often committed by Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The electoral court of Saxony would not find it a difficult matter to expo&s;e to the whole world the fal&s;ity of the accu|&s;ations, which Pru&s;&s;ia &s;o much endeavours to demon&s;trate from its pretended Ju&s;tifying Proofs, and to confront the idle interpreter of them: for, indeed, the pretences &s;o much boa&s;ted of, cannot, upon a clo&s;er compari&s;on of the circum|&s;tances, have any great weight with the unprejudiced reader.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, what ho&s;tile de&s;igns can be gathered from the two &s;entiments of the privy council to his maje&s;ty the king of Poland and elector of Saxony, annexed, by way of ex|tract, to the Pru&s;&s;ian Memorial, Numb. VI. and VII. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;entiments contains not a word of their looking upon the fourth &s;ecret article of the treaty of Peter&s;burg, as an offen&s;ive convention: they only &s;ay, that upon a future exi&s;tence of the ca&s;e of covenant, all the contracting and ac|ceding parties were to be regarded as belligerant parties; which according to the above true principles, and frequent examples, is not again&s;t the nature of a defen&s;ive alliance. The &s;econd &s;entiment takes only notice of what the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, according to his own way of thinking, might &s;ay, and how he would take and mi&s;apply the matter.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the other allegations are to this purport: That the electoral court of Saxony would direct its mea&s;ures ac|cording to future events, waiting fir&s;t a Pru&s;&s;ian attack and &s;ub&s;equent diver&s;ion to be made by its allies. There is not found any trace, to di&s;cover by, &s;ome real concert re&s;embling offen&s;ive mea&s;ures, that were taken in conjunction with the courts of Vienna and Peter&s;burg, previous to the Pru&s;&s;ian in|va&s;ion of Saxony; though this court is accu&s;ed of &s;uch by Pru&s;&s;ia. The hopes of the Saxon court were fixed only on future events, which appears by the letter of count Bruhl, in&s;erted in the Pru&s;&s;ian Memorial, dated but a &s;hort time be|fore ho&s;tilities were commenced, <HI>viz.</HI> the 18th of July. His words are the&s;e; <Q>&startq;Neither do I de&s;pair, but we may be able to avail our&s;elves of &s;uch favourable events, as will, per|haps, occur hereafter.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Allegations of this kind are quite oppo&s;ite to the pretexts of Pru&s;&s;ia, and clearly prove that no defen&s;ive, much le&s;s of|fen&s;ive mea&s;ures, were then concerted with the court of Dre&s;|den, though it was then time to enter upon them again&s;t the approaching enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="4890">
It likewi&s;e appears by Numb. XIX. that the armaments of Pru&s;&s;ia have begun to be extraordinary as early as in the year 1754; which is confirmed by Numb. XX. giving an account of the rai&s;ing of &s;even new Pru&s;&s;ian regi|ments.</P>
<P>The letters of count Flemming to count Bruhl, Numb. XXVII. and XXVIII. contain &s;o many &s;en&s;ible con&s;idera|tions on the nature of affairs, as they &s;tood then, but a &s;hort time before the Pru&s;&s;ian inva&s;ion, that it is hard to compre|hend the rea&s;ons that could induce the court of Berlin to make them public. The an&s;wers given by the court of Vi|enna to the demands of Pru&s;&s;ia, make part of the&s;e letters, which are in &s;ub&s;tance, <Q>&startq;That the court of Vienna had no other view than to keep peace, but was obliged to prepare again&s;t all events." And again, "That this court had no de&s;ign for war, but would not be wanting to prepare for its own defence; and that it could not enter upon any farther declarations to its own prejudice." Again, "That the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould not be attacked at lea&s;t this year, provided he remained quiet,&endq;</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of all the&s;e letters, and the conjectures concern|ing future events, are mini&s;terial &s;entiments, which do not determine any thing, much le&s;s advance any convincing proof of a re&s;olution being taken, previous to the Pru&s;&s;ian inva&s;ion, to change the defen&s;ive treaty with Ru&s;&s;ia into an offen&s;ive alliance, which, according to the above principles, the par|ties would have been fully authorized to do.</P>
<P>It is but the fancy of Pru&s;&s;ia, that bare letters and the &s;en|timents of a foreign mini&s;ter can be taken for proofs, in op|po&s;ition to the plaine&s;t delarations given by the court it&s;elf, where &s;uch a mini&s;ter re&s;ides.</P>
<P>But the court of Vienna did not find proper to make a new declaration in compliance with the Pru&s;&s;ian dictates, after a &s;ufficient an&s;wer was given already to the fir&s;t demand. The rea&s;on was this: the truce propo&s;ed for two years &s;uppo&s;ed an actual war and real offen&s;ive circum&s;tances, or offen&s;ive mea&s;ures agreed upon by the two Empre&s;&s;es, which this court could not, again&s;t truth, and the a&s;&s;urances already given, al|low to be the ca&s;e&punc; and becau&s;e the obligations by the peace of Dre&s;den would, in con&s;equence of &s;uch a declaration, have been void.</P>
<P>As for the court of Vienna in particular, the Pru&s;&s;ians might have &s;pared them&s;elves the trouble of &s;tretching forth
<PB N="477" REF="4900">
their hands to unlawful means, and the violent breaking open of the royal cabinet in a neutral country and co-e&s;tate of the Empire. This court never had a mind to deny its di&s;tru&s;t in regard to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, or to di&s;gui&s;e its de|&s;igns by giving a clo&s;e attention to the continual armaments and unwarrantable violences committed on all &s;ides: nor could this court be frightened by a Pru&s;&s;ian aggre&s;&s;ion, or de|terred from its defen&s;ive mea&s;ures by any threats and arti|fices. There have been taken, &s;ince the late breach, the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures, in order to make the author of the pre&s;ent troubles repent of his open inju&s;tice, violences, and ra&s;h perfidy.</P>
<P>The&s;e general an&s;wers to the Pru&s;&s;ian pieces are thought &s;ufficient; there being nothing found therein but a heap of u&s;ele&s;s and odious repetitions of the &s;ame figment. The far|fetched accu&s;ations about things not belonging to the &s;ubject, cannot be called real charges, but Pru&s;&s;ian calumnies. The &s;ubtleties of arguing, and other &s;chola&s;tic &s;tuff about the dif|ference between offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive wars, are not worth a reply, as long as the aggre&s;&s;or cannot make good by convinc|ing proofs, but only by idle a&s;&s;ertions and tales &s;o often con|tradicted, his fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, "That Au&s;tria made the fir&s;t preparations for war, and agreed with Ru&s;&s;ia and Saxony up|on offen&s;ive mea&s;ures."</P>
<P>But &s;ince a proof, &s;o contrary to manife&s;t truth, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly be expected, it al&s;o mu&s;t not be expected on our part, that we &s;hould enter upon the particulars of the late Pru&s;&s;ian impre&s;&s;ions intended to confute the reply of the court of Vienna to the Pru&s;&s;ian declaration, and to claim the guarantee of the Empire for its di&s;turber. The public cannot have been much edified by the regard due to crowned heads which they boa&s;t of, nor di&s;covered any thing very material that could be deemed a pattern, (except for affronting): her maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-queen can be very ea&s;y in regard to her co-e&s;tates, there being no rea&s;on of their odium towards her for any vio|lences, or dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t their liberties and ancient rights.</P>
<P>As for Mr. Weingarten the younger, it is enough to ac|quaint here the public with one particular circum&s;tance, which, as for truth, may be depended upon. He has, for near two years, had a Pru&s;&s;ian pen&s;ion, which was paid to him by the &s;ieur Eichel, privy coun&s;ellor to the king; and the king him&s;elf has twice entered upon &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with
<PB N="478" REF="4910">
him. From this the impartial public will judge what ought to be thought of the Pru&s;&s;ian Excu&s;e and Cabinet-order con|ceived in uncommonly polite terms; and whether it is not probable that this gentleman is &s;till &s;ecreted &s;omewhere by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. His per&s;on and family have often been de|manded, but without effect.</P>
<P>Finally, it appears very plain that no tranquillity for Eu|rope, nor any &s;ecurity for the Empire, or its &s;tates, of what re|ligion &s;oever, is to be hoped for, as long as the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia can, with &s;ucce&s;s, commit violences after violences, de&s;troy whole provinces, and break through the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties of peace, at his plea&s;ure.</P>
