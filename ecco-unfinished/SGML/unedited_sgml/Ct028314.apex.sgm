<P>NAY, I was only afraid my vi&s;it to-day was trouble&s;ome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it, my dear Ea&s;y, far from it; to take a &s;crambling dinner with me here at the playhou&s;e, the fir&s;t day of our opening was a great act of charity, and I am very much obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; I a&s;&s;ure you it is a matter of informa|tion to me as well as entertainment.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="2" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, perhaps you thought our fare behind the &s;cenes &s;till more un&s;ub&s;tantial?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did indeed; and from what I have &s;o often witne&s;|&s;ed on the &s;tage, how could I &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e? why, I have &s;een Macbeth's Scotch nobles as poorly regaled as if they were in the Cave of Famine; not a hut on the Highlands could furni&s;h wor&s;e provender; nay, I have &s;een our jovial Harry the Eighth, and all his courtiers, half &s;tarved by Cardinal Wol&s;ey at a ban|quet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;ure I have known the Miller of Mansfield at &s;upper make half the hou&s;e hungry; and many a farce, as well as pantomime, has owed its life on the &s;tage to a roa&s;t fowl and &s;au&s;ages.</P>

<P>Well, ma&s;ter Manager, here's a good &s;ea&s;on to you!</P>

<P>A Mr. Bu&s;tleton, Sir, has been inquiring after you at the &s;tage-door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bu&s;tleton, I think he &s;aid was his name, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bu&s;tleton! they did not &s;ay I was in the hou&s;e, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERVANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They &s;aid they did not know, Sir; and he is gone behind the &s;cenes to look for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the gentleman through to the boxes directly, d'ye hear? <STAGE>[Exit Serv.]</STAGE> It would be particularly in|convenient to &s;ee him at pre&s;ent; no knowing when we &s;hou'd get rid of him; he'll talk to eternity!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bu&s;tleton; that's the idle man of bu&s;ine&s;s, is it not? who does an infinite deal of nothing, becau&s;e he wants &s;omething to do:&mdash;Talk! why his tongue travels
<PB N="4" REF="8">
po&s;t, and all his &s;entences are periods of a mile; he conver&s;es with every body, upon every thing; Scan|dal, Politicks, Religion, Arts, Tabernacles, Theatres, the Court and the Cock-pit, Newmarket and the Con|vocation, and a thou&s;and other objects, divide his atten|tion. He knows the publick and private affairs of the town, and the nation, much better than tho&s;e of his family; and is perfectly at home every where but in his own hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very man; his head is in a con&s;tant whirl of ideas, and his per&s;on in perpetual motion; he is known among his friends and acquaintance by the title of the Riding Magazine: he lives about a dozen miles out of town, but doats upon London; comes up on a hard trot every day after breakfa&s;t, &s;tops every friend he meets to receive and communicate intelligence, and enquires after news from the men at the turnpikes; nay, &s;ometimes, to hold him&s;elf in wind, tells the keeper of the gate at Ken&s;ington what he learnt &s;rom the toll-gatherer at Hammer&s;mith.</P>
</SP>

<P>I'll &s;tep in directly; and plea&s;e to take care of my gallo&s;hes, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>There he is, and coming in too; I hear him in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! my little Dapperwit! I knew I &s;hou'd find you at the Receipt of Cu&s;tom; I thought to have met with you behind the &s;cenes, like a trade&s;man behind the counter. I went there, but was told you were in Jewell's parlour&mdash;but hold! I hear very bad&mdash;<STAGE>(&s;eeing Ea&s;y.)</STAGE> Oh! how dy'e do, Mr.&mdash;what's the Gentleman's name?</P>

<P>Oh, Mr. Ea&s;y, I din'd with an Uncle of yours ye&s;|terday at the Thatch'd&mdash;by the bye, you mu&s;t give me leave to pull off my riding-&s;tockings and great coat, Mr. Dapperwit; I think my linen begins to look rather &s;oiled too; and if I thought yours wou'd fit me, I wou'd get you to lend me one of your &s;hi$$s.</P>

<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occa&s;ion; your appearance is very&mdash;</P>

<P>So &s;o, I believe; I have been in twenty different places, and engag'd on twenty different affairs, &s;ince I got to town this morning.</P>

<SPEAKER>MANAGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are never idle, Mr. Bu&s;tleton.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Idle! it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man that has three ideas in his head to be idle; every moment affords new diver&s;ions, and every hour teems with employment: Mr. Ea&s;y, I beg to have your opinion on this &s;ubject&mdash;by the bye, Mr. Dapperwit, remember that I have &s;omething of con&s;equence to tell you afterwards;&mdash;you are a Gentleman, Mr. Ea&s;y, and none but a Gentle|man can have a ju&s;t notion of creating him&s;elf bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;Trade&s;men, Merchants, Bankers, Brokers, Law|yers, and &s;o forth, have no idea of bu&s;ine&s;s out of the narrow routine of their own dull vocations&mdash;and in|deed it is not every Gentleman that has a &s;ufficient ta|lent for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one in a thou&s;and.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BUSTLETON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in ten thou&s;and; I &s;ee you comprehend me, Mr. Ea&s;y; I love to talk with a man upon a &s;ubject that he is ma&s;ter of; for then we, each of us, give and receive information&mdash;One day talking with Admiral Sternpo&s;t at the Navy Office about the Battle of La Hogue&mdash;by the bye, that is a very good &s;tory; &s;o put me in mind to tell you that afterwards.</P>

<P>Multifarious, as u&s;ual; fir&s;t, a Committee of A&s;&s;o|ciation&mdash;then a &s;hort peep at the Exhibition&mdash;then a Ballot at the India Hou&s;e&mdash;then an hour and a half in the Gallery of the Hou&s;e of Commons&mdash;then a Cau&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords&mdash;after which I took a ha&s;ty mor&s;el at the coffee-hou&s;e, which I left half unfini&s;h'd to run and tell you &s;ome news of very great impor|tance to your&s;elf, Mr. Dapperwit.</P>

<P>Great importance! what is it? why did not you communicate it immediately?</P>

<P>No doubt of it; a committee of patentees have &s;at upon the que&s;tion in the trea&s;ury of Covent Garden&mdash;and a &s;ub-committee at Drury Lane; the chairman has reported&mdash;and a very ingenious report, let me tell you&mdash;He has reported that the patent of Drury Lane is thrice &s;eptennial, both tho&s;e of Covent Garden per|petual, and the Hay-market, only annual; yet that your influence on the town has increa&s;ed, is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;h'd; that they ought to take away your board of actors, make your wardrobe u&s;ele&s;s (By the bye, they &s;ay that of your predece&s;&s;or was furni&s;h'd by contract) and attack your civil li&s;t; in &s;hort, that <HI>one</HI> hou&s;e &s;hou'd withdraw their performers, and the <HI>other</HI> forbid theirs from &s;upplying their places.</P>

<P>Oh, upon my &s;oul now, that's no ra&s;on at all&mdash;have not we got the playhou&s;e for all night&mdash;and mayn't we be the play actors our&s;elves? have not half the Jontlemen and Ladies in England been playing the fool all over the country, and has not your own little Manager there been blacking his own little face at Chri&s;tmas down in North Wales? Have not your Lords and fine Ladies been taking off Miniature Pictures, ju&s;t by the Bath road? and have not the folks been taking Miniature copies at Large in Drury Lane? and are not there two great Hou&s;es down at We&s;tmin&s;ter,&mdash;(not to &s;pake of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall)&mdash;where the Lords and Jontlemen are talking all day, and all night too fait, for their own diver&s;ion and that of the Pub|lick? And pray now where's the want of a Play at your Schools for Eloquence, where the company can every night act a little play of their own? and why &s;hou'd your fooli&s;h Manager pay his Actors for talking, when the Publick will pay him for letting them talk them|&s;elves? For my part, I am a true born Iri&s;hman, and one of the Loyal Volunteers; and &s;o I &s;tand up for the privileges of an Engli&s;hman&mdash;and I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the mo&s;t material part of a Playhou&s;e is the Au|dience; and as long as the Audience are pre&s;ent, it does not &s;ignify a bra&s;s farthing whether there are Actors or no; and I &s;ay&mdash;I &s;ay&mdash;I have nothing more to &s;ay at all.</P>

<P>I beg leave, with all the diffidence natural to my &s;ex, to offer a &s;hort word on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: the gentleman who has ju&s;t &s;poken, if I may tru&s;t to his accent and dialect, is of a nation, to which ladies are inclin'd to be partial; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged that &s;ometimes, from being very fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a &s;ubject, they are apt not to think it nece&s;&s;ary to make it quite clear to other people; in this &s;ublime confu|&s;ion of ideas, I apprehend, the ingenious gentleman in my eye has forgot to &s;peak to the main que&s;tion now before this a&s;&s;embly&mdash;The que&s;tion urg'd by the gen|tleman on the floor, I conceive to be the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Manager; now this pretended Di&s;tre&s;s, I humbly contend, is, or ought to be, no Di&s;tre&s;s at all; What is the Plea? want of auxiliaries. But if the Winter Potentates will not let out their troops upon &s;ub&s;idies, are there no other forces to be rais'd? and is not a time of Theatrical Conte&s;t as well as that of National War, the very moment to rai&s;e them? Is Human Nature confin'd or exhau&s;ted? I know the fact to be otherwi&s;e. Are not there hundreds of able bodied actors, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the hun|dreds of Drury? are there no Theatrical Plants grow|ing out of the hot beds of Covent Garden? Millions! every hou&s;e, every &s;hop is a nur&s;ery. Is there a Milli|ner's Pren$ice in Town, that has not offer'd her&s;elf to the Manager, and is not already perfect in Jane Shore and Lady Townly? or a Hair Dre&s;&s;er that is not anxi|ous to throw away his pomatum and curling irons, for a Dagger and a Truncheon? Let the Manager <HI>&s;kirr the Country round!</HI> let him bring upon the Town, what the Town are always glad to &s;ee, &s;ome

new faces! let him produce too &s;ome good pieces! and then his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es will be reliev'd, and he will be &s;ure of Publick Encouragement, without being reduc'd to the di&s;grace and mortification of a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion or an apology.</P>

<P>I humbly beg to offer a few loo&s;e thoughts on the que&s;tion now under agitation<HI>&mdash;the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Ma|nager.</HI> This Di&s;tre&s;s is founded on the ab&s;ence of the actors; but if we can &s;upply their ab&s;ence, without being encumber'd with their pre&s;ence, I humbly con|ceive we &s;hall be con&s;iderable gainers&mdash;a propo&s;al was formerly made to pre&s;ent the Publick with actors in pa&s;te-board, and it was much doubted whether they wou'd not be preferable to the race of live actors. What were the actors of Menander the Grecian? Pa&s;te|board! What were tho&s;e of Plautus the Roman? Pa&s;te-board! What were tho&s;e of Terence the Car|thaginian? Pa&s;te-board! to what then can the Britons have recour&s;e, but Pa&s;te-board? Bu&s;ts on this plan have been exibited in this very Theatre, and are now actually exibiting in another place; if therefore the Manager will give us the delinquent performers in Pa&s;te-board, while the arti&s;t takes off the figures and faces, I will endeavour to give you their manner and voices.</P>
