<P>SO, my dear, we went on too fa&s;t, it
&s;eems: Sir George was &s;o obliging as
to &s;ettle all without waiting for Emily's
con&s;ent; not having &s;uppo&s;ed her refu&s;al
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to be in the chapter of po&s;&s;ibilities: after
having communicated their plan of ope|rations
to me as an affair &s;ettled, papa was
di&s;patched, as Sir George's amba&s;&s;ador,
to inform Emily of his gracious intentions
in her favor.</P>
<P>She received him with proper dignity,
and like a girl of true &s;pirit told him,
that as the delay was originally from Sir
George, &s;he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on ob&s;erving the
conditions very exactly, and was deter|mined
to wait till &s;pring, whatever might
be the contents of Mrs. Clayton's ex|pected
letter; re&s;erving to her&s;elf al&s;o the
privilege of refu&s;ing him even then, if
upon mature deliberation &s;he &s;hould think
proper &s;o to do.</P>
<P>She has further in&s;i&s;ted, that till that
time he &s;hall leave Silleri; take up his
abode at Quebec, unle&s;s, which &s;he thinks
mo&s;t advi&s;eable, he &s;hould return to Mon|treal
for the winter; and never attempt
&s;eeing her without witne&s;&s;es, as their pre|&s;ent
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;ituation is particularly delicate, and
that whil&s;t it continues they can have
nothing to &s;ay to each other which their
common friends may not with propriety
hear: all &s;he can be prevailed on to con|&s;ent
to in his favor, is to allow him <HI>cn at|tendant</HI>
to vi&s;it here like any other gentle|man.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;he would &s;end him back to Mon|treal,
for I &s;ee plainly he will &s;poil all our
little parties.</P>
<P>Emily is a fine girl, Lucy, and I am
friends with her again; &s;o, my dear, I &s;hall
revive my coterie, and be happy two or
three months longer. I have &s;ent to a&s;k my
two &s;weet fellows at Quebec to dine here:
I really long to &s;ee them; I &s;hall let them
into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs here, for
they both de&s;pi&s;e Sir George as much as I
do; the creature looks amazingly fooli&s;h,
and I enjoy his humiliation not a little:
&s;uch an animal to &s;et up for being beloved
indeed! O to be &s;ure!</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Emily has &s;ent for me to her apartment.
Adieu for a moment.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>She has &s;hewn me Mrs. Melmoth's let|ter
on the &s;ubject of concluding the mar|riage
immediately: it is in the true &s;pirit
of family impertinence. She writes with
the kind di&s;creet in&s;olence of a relation;
and Emily has an&s;wered her with the ge|nuine
&s;pirit of an independent Engli&s;h-woman,
who is &s;o happy as to be her own
mi&s;tre&s;s, and who is therefore determined
to think for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She has refu&s;ed going to Montreal at all
this winter; and has hinted, though not
impolitely, that &s;he wants no guardian of
her conduct but her&s;elf; adding a compli|ment
to my lady&s;hip's di&s;cretion &s;o very
civil, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to repeat it
with decency.</P>

<P>WE have the &s;ame parties and amu&s;e|ments
we u&s;ed to have, my dear,

<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, E&s;&abque; Pall Mall.
<DATE>Jan. 25.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SO you intend, my dear Jack, to marry
when you are quite tired of a life of
gallantry: the lady will be much obliged
to you for a heart, the refu&s;e of half the
pro&s;titutes in town; a heart, the be&s;t feel|ings
of which will be entirely obliterated;
a heart hardened by a long commerce
with the mo&s;t unworthy of the &s;ex; and
which will bring di&s;gu&s;t, &s;u&s;picion, cold|ne&s;s,
and depravity of ta&s;te, to the bo&s;om
of &s;en&s;ibility and innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
For my own part, though fond of wo|men
to the greate&s;t degree, I have had,
con&s;idering my profe&s;&s;ion and complex|ion,
very few intrigues. I have always
had an idea I &s;hould &s;ome time or other
marry, and have been unwilling to bring
to a &s;tate in which I hoped for happine&s;s
from mutual affection, a heart worn out
by a cour&s;e of gallantries: to a contrary
conduct is owing mo&s;t of our unhappy
marriages; the woman brings with her
all her &s;tock of tenderne&s;s, truth, and
affection; the man's is exhau&s;ted before
they meet: &s;he finds the generous deli|cate
tenderne&s;s of her &s;oul, not only
unreturned, but unob&s;erved; &s;he fancies
&s;ome other woman the object of his
affection, &s;he is unhappy, &s;he pines in
&s;ecret; he ob&s;erves her di&s;content, accu&s;es
her of caprice; and her portion is wretch|edne&s;s
for life.</P>
<P>If I did not ardently wi&s;h your happi|ne&s;s,
I &s;hould not thus repeatedly combat
a prejudice, which, as you have &s;en&s;ibility,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
will infallibly make the greater part of
your life a &s;cene of in&s;ipidity and regret.</P>
<P>You are right, Jack, as to the &s;avages;
the only way to civilize them is to <HI>feminize</HI>
their women; but the ta&s;k is rather diffi|cult:
at pre&s;ent their manners differ in no|thing
from tho&s;e of the men; they even
add to the ferocity of the latter.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to know the &s;tate of my
heart: excu&s;e me, Jack; you know nothing
of love; and we who do, never di&s;clo&s;e it's
my&s;teries to the prophane: be&s;ides, I al|ways
choo&s;e a female for the confidante of
my &s;entiments; I hate even to &s;peak of
love to one of my own &s;ex.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am going a party with half a
dozen ladies, and have not another minute
to &s;pare.</P>

<P>I EVERY hour, my dear, grow more in
love with French manners; there is
&s;omething charming in being young and
&s;prightly all one's life: it would appear
ab&s;urd in England to hear, what I have
ju&s;t heard, a fat virtuous lady of &s;eventy
toa&s;t <HI>Love and Opportunity</HI> to a young fel|low:
but 'tis nothing here: they dance
too to the la&s;t ga&s;p; I have &s;een the
daughter, mother, and grand-daughter,
in the &s;ame French country dance.</P>
<P>They are perfectly right; and I honor
them for their good &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, in de|termining
to make life agreeable as long
as they can.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to age, I am re&s;olved to go
home, Lucy; I have found three grey
<PB N="11" REF="13">
hairs this morning; they tell me 'tis com|mon;
this vile climate is at war with beau|ty,
makes one's hair grey, and one's hands|red.
I won't &s;tay ab&s;olutely.</P>
<P>Do you know there is a very pretty
fellow here, Lucy, Captain Howard, who
has taken a fancy to make people believe
he and I are on good terms? He affects
to &s;it by me, to dance with me, to whi&s;|per
nothing to me, to bow with an air of
my&s;tery, and to &s;hew me all the little at|tentions
of a lover in public, though he
never yet &s;aid a civil thing to me when
we were alone.</P>
<P>I was &s;tanding with him this morning
near the brow of the hill, leaning again&s;t a
tree in the &s;un&s;hine, and looking down the
precipice below, when I &s;aid &s;omething
of the lover's leap, and in play, as you will
&s;uppo&s;e, made a &s;tep forwards: we had
been talking of indifferent things, his air
was till then indolence it&s;elf; but on this
<PB N="12" REF="14">
little motion of mine, though there was
not the lea&s;t danger, he with the utmo&s;t
&s;eeming eagerne&s;s catched hold of me as if
alarmed at the very idea, and with the
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate air prote&s;ted his life de|pended
on mine, and that he would not
live an hour after me. I looked at him
with a&s;toni&s;hment, not being able to com|prehend
the meaning of this &s;udden flight,
when turning my head, I &s;aw a gentleman
and lady clo&s;e behind us, whom he had
ob&s;erved though I had not. They were
retiring: &startq;Pray approach, my dear Ma|dam,&endq;
&s;aid I; &startq;we have no &s;ecrets,
this declaration was intended for you
to hear; we were talking of the weather
before you came.&endq;</P>
<P>He affected to &s;mile, though I &s;aw he
was mortified; but as his &s;mile &s;hewed
the fine&s;t teeth imaginable I forgave him:
he is really very hand&s;ome, and 'tis pity
he has this fooli&s;h quality of preferring
the &s;hadow to the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
I &s;hall, however, de&s;ire him to flirt el&s;e|where,
as this <HI>badinage,</HI> however innocent,
may hurt my character, and give pain to
my little Fitzgerald: I believe I begin to
love this fellow, becau&s;e I begin to be
delicate on the &s;ubject of flirtations, and
feel my &s;pirit of coquetry decline every
day.</P>
<P><DATE>29th.</DATE></P>
<P>Mrs. Clayton has wrote, my dear; and,
has at la&s;t conde&s;cended to allow Emily
the honor of being her daughter-in-law,
in con&s;ideration of her &s;on's happine&s;s,
and of engagements entered into with her
own con&s;ent; though &s;he very prudently
ob&s;erves, that what was a proper match
for Captain Clayton is by no means &s;o for
Sir George; and talks &s;omething of an
offer of a citizen's daughter with fifty
thou&s;and pounds, and the promi&s;e of an
Iri&s;h title. She has, however, ob&s;erved
that indi&s;creet engagements are better
broke than kept.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
Sir George has &s;hewn the letter, a very
indelicate one in my opinion, to my
father and me; and has talked a great
deal of non&s;en&s;e on the &s;ubject. He wants
to &s;hew it to Emily, and I advi&s;e him to
it, becau&s;e I know the effect it will have.
I &s;ee plainly he wi&s;hes to make a great
merit of keeping his engagement, if he
does keep it: he hinted a little fear of
breaking her heart; and I am convinced
if he thought &s;he could &s;urvive his infi|delity,
all his tenderne&s;s and con&s;tancy
would cede to filial duty and a coronet.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>After much deliberation, Sir George
has determined to write to Emily, inclo&s;e
his mother's letter, and call in the after|noon
to enjoy the triumph of his genero|&s;ity
in keeping his engagement, when it
is in his power to do &s;o much better: 'tis
a pretty plan, and I encourage him in it;
my father, who wi&s;hes the match, &s;hrugs
his &s;houlders, and frowns at me; but the
<PB N="15" REF="17">
little man is fixed as fate in his re&s;olve, and
is writing at this moment in my father's
apartment. I long to &s;ee his letter; I
dare &s;ay it will be a curio&s;ity: 'tis &s;hort,
however, for he is coming out of the room
already.</P>
<P>Adieu! my father calls for this letter;
it is to go in one of his to New York, and

<P>I Have been with Emily, who has been
reading Mrs. Clayton's letter; I &s;aw
joy &s;parkle in her eyes as &s;he went on,
her little heart &s;eemed to flutter with tran|&s;port;
I &s;ee two things very clearly, one
<PB N="20" REF="22">
of which is, that &s;he never loved this little
in&s;ipid Baronet; the other I leave your
fagacity to find out. All the &s;pirit of her
countenance is returned: &s;he walks in air;
her cheeks have the blu&s;h of plea&s;ure; I
never &s;aw &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a change. I never
felt more joy from the acqui&s;ition of a new
lover, than &s;he &s;eems to find in the pro&s;pect
of lo&s;ing an old one.</P>
<P>She has written to Sir George, and in a
&s;tyle that I know will hurt him; for though
I believe he wi&s;hes her to give him up, yet
his vanity would de&s;ire it &s;hould co&s;t her
very dear; and appear the effort of di&s;|intere&s;ted
love, and romantic genero&s;ity,
not what it really is, the effect of the mo&s;t
tranquil and perfect indifference.</P>
<P>By the way, a di&s;intere&s;ted mi&s;tre&s;s is,
according to my ideas, a mi&s;tre&s;s who
<HI>fancies</HI> &s;he loves: we may talk what we
plea&s;e, at a di&s;tance, of &s;acrificing the

his happine&s;s by de&s;troying our own; but
when it comes to the point, I am rather

would give up a man I loved to the fir&s;t
duche&s;s in Chri&s;tendom: 'tis all mighty
well in theory; but for the practical part,
let who will believe it for Bell.</P>
<P>Indeed when a woman finds her lover
inclined to change, 'tis good to make a
virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and give the thing a
&s;entimental turn, which gratifies his vani|ty,
and does not wound one's own.</P>

more indifference to her lover, a cir|cum&s;tance

<P>My father is &s;etting every engine at

Emily to have determined from
pique, not from the real feelings of her

&s;hould counterwork him, and &s;o jealous
of my advi&s;ing her to continue a conduct

leave us a moment together; he even
ob&s;erves carefully that each goes into
her re&s;pective apartment when we retire to
bed.</P>
<P>This jealou&s;y has &s;tarted an idea which
I think will amu&s;e us, and which I &s;hall
take the fir&s;t opportunity of communicat|ing
to Emily; 'tis to write each other at
night our &s;entiments on whatever pa&s;&s;es in
the day: if &s;he approves the plan, I will
&s;end you the letters, which will &s;ave me
<PB N="26" REF="28">
a great deal of trouble in telling you all
our <HI>petites hi&s;toires.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;cheme will have another advan|tage;
we &s;hall be a thou&s;and times more
&s;incere and open to each other by letter
than face to face; I have long &s;een by her

<P>I Have but a moment, my Lucy, to tell
you, my divine Emily has broke with
her lover, who this morning took an eter|nal
leave of her, and &s;et out for Montreal
in his way to New York, whence he pro|po&s;es
to embark for England.</P>
<P>My &s;en&s;ations on this occa&s;ion are not
to be de&s;cribed: I admire that amiable
delicacy which has influenced her to give
up every advantage of rank and fortune
which could tempt the heart of woman,
rather than unite her&s;elf to a man for
whom &s;he felt the lea&s;t degree of indiffe|rence;
and this, without regarding the
cen&s;ures of her family, or of the world,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
by whom, what they will call her impru|dence,
will never be forgiven: a woman
who is capable of acting &s;o nobly, is worthy
of being beloved, of being adored, by
every man who has a &s;oul to di&s;tingui&s;h
her perfections.</P>
<P>If I was a vain man, I might perhaps
fancy her regard for me had &s;ome &s;hare in
determining her conduct, but I am con|vinced
of the contrary; 'tis the native de|licacy
of her &s;oul alone, incapable of form|ing
an union in which the heart has no
&s;hare, which, independent of any other
con&s;ideration, has been the cau&s;e of a re|&s;olution
&s;o worthy of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>That &s;he has the tendere&s;t affection for
me, I cannot doubt one moment; her at|tention
is too flattering to be unob&s;erved;
but 'tis that kind of affection in which
the mind alone is concerned. I never
gave her the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint that I loved
her: in her &s;ituation, it would have been
even an outrage to have done &s;o. She
<PB N="29" REF="31">
knows the narrowne&s;s of my circum&s;tan|ces,
and how near impo&s;&s;ible it is for me
to marry; &s;he therefore could not have
an idea&mdash;no, my dear girl, 'tis not to
love, but to true delicacy, that &s;he has
$acrificed avarice and ambition; and &s;he
is a thou&s;and times the more e&s;timable

<P>I Have mentioned my plan to Emily,
who is charmed with it; 'tis a pretty
evening amu&s;ement for two &s;olitary girls
in the country.</P>
<P>Behold the fir&s;t fruits of our corre&s;pon|dence:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;To Mi&s;s FERMOR.&endq;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;It is not to you, my dear girl, I need
vindicate my conduct in regard to Sir
George; you have from the fir&s;t ap|proved
it; you have even advi&s;ed it.
If I have been to blame, 'tis in having
too long delayed an explanation on a
<PB N="31" REF="33">
point of &s;uch importance to us both.
I have been long on the borders of a
precipice, without courage to retire
from &s;o dangerous a &s;ituation: overborne
by my family, I have been near marry|ing
a man for whom I have not the lea&s;t
tenderne&s;s, and who&s;e conver&s;ation is
even now tedious to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear friend, we were not formed
for each other: our minds have not the
lea&s;t re&s;emblance. Have you not ob|&s;erved,
that, when I have timidly ha|zarded
my ideas on the delicacy nece&s;|&s;ary
to keep love alive in marriage, and
the difficulty of pre&s;erving the heart of
the object beloved in &s;o intimate an
union, he has indolently a&s;&s;ented, with
a coldne&s;s not to be de&s;cribed, to &s;en|timents
which it is plain from his man|ner
he did not under&s;tand; whil&s;t ano|ther,
not intere&s;ted in the conver&s;ation,
has, by his countenance, by the fire of
his eyes, by looks more eloquent than
<PB N="32" REF="34">
all language, &s;hewed his &s;oul was of
intelligence with mine!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the force of engage|ments
entered into with my con&s;ent,
though not the effect of my free, unbi|a&s;&s;ed
choice, and the fear of making
Sir George, by whom I &s;uppo&s;ed my|&s;elf
beloved, unhappy, have thus long
prevented my re&s;olving to break with
him for ever; and though I could not
bring my&s;elf to marry him, I found
my&s;elf at the &s;ame time incapable of
a&s;&s;uming &s;ufficient re&s;olution to tell him
&s;o, 'till his mother's letter gave me &s;o
happy an occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There is no &s;aying what tran&s;port I
feel in being freed from the in&s;upport|able
yoke of this engagement, which
has long &s;at heavy on my heart, and
&s;u&s;pended the natural chearfulne&s;s of
my temper.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
&startq;Yes, my dear, your Emily has been
wretched, without daring to confe&s;s it
even to you: I was a&s;hamed of owning
I had entered into &s;uch engagements
with a man whom I had never loved$
though I had for a &s;hort time mi&s;taken
e&s;teem for a greater degree of affection
than my heart ever really knew. How
fatal, my dear Bell, is this mi&s;take to
half our &s;ex, and how happy am I to
have di&s;covered mine in time!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;carce yet a&s;ked my&s;elf what I
intend; but I think it will be mo&s;t pru|dent
to return to England in the fir&s;t
&s;hip, and retire to a relation of my mo|ther's
in the country, where I can live
with decency on my little fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whatever is my fate, no &s;ituation can
be equally unhappy with that of being
wife to a man for whom I have not
even the &s;lighte&s;t friend&s;hip or e&s;teem,
for who&s;e conver&s;ation I have not the
lea&s;t ta&s;te, and who, if I know him,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
would for ever think me under an obli|gation
to him for marrying me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee I give no
pain to his heart, by a &s;tep which has
relieved mine from mi&s;ery: his feelings
are tho&s;e of wounded vanity, not of love.&endq;</P>

<P>I have no patience with relations,
Lucy; this &s;weet girl has been two years
wretched under the bondage her uncle's
avarice (for he fore&s;aw Sir George's ac|qui&s;ition,
though &s;he did not) prepared
for her. Parents &s;hould choo&s;e our com|pany,
but never even pretend to direct
our choice; if they take care we conver&s;e
with men of honour only, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
we can choo&s;e ami&s;s: a conformity of
ta&s;te and &s;entiment alone can make mar|riage
<PB N="35" REF="37">
happy, and of that none but the par|ties
concerned can judge.</P>
<P>By the way, I think long engagements,
even between per&s;ons who love, extremely
unfavourable to happine&s;s: it is certainly
right to be long enough acquainted to
know &s;omething of each other's temper;
but 'tis bad to let the fir&s;t fire burn out
before we come together; and when we
have once re&s;olved, I have no notion of
delaying a moment.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould ever con&s;ent to marry Fitz|gerald,

<P>WOULD one think it po&s;&s;ible,
Lucy, that Sir George &s;hould
con&s;ole him&s;elf for the lo&s;s of all that is
lovely in woman, by the &s;ordid pro&s;pect
of acquiring, by an intere&s;ted marriage, a

already much more than he can either en|joy

<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
The vulgar of every rank expect happi|ne&s;s

tho&s;e who dare to think, tho&s;e

<P>I have &s;een my lovely Emily &s;ince I

I have done lately, le&s;t the world, ever
&s;tudious to blame, &s;hould mi&s;con&s;true
her conduct on this very delicate oc|ca&s;ion.
I am even afraid to &s;hew my
u&s;ual attention to her when pre&s;ent, le&s;t
&s;he her&s;elf &s;hould think I pre&s;ume on the
politene&s;s &s;he has ever &s;hewn me, and &s;ee
her breaking with Sir George in a fal&s;e

to me, the more guarded I ought to

&s;he has equal decorums to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
I cannot however help encouraging a

to her: her lovely eyes have a
&s;oftne&s;s when they meet mine, to which
words cannot do ju&s;tice: &s;he talks le&s;s to
me than to others, but it is in a tone of
voice which penetrates my &s;oul; and
when I &s;peak, her attention is mo&s;t flat|tering,
though of a nature not to be &s;een
by common ob&s;ervers; without &s;eeming
to di&s;tingui&s;h me from the crowd who
&s;trive to engage her e&s;teem and friend&s;hip,
&s;he has a manner of addre&s;&s;ing me which
the heart alone can feel; &s;he contrives to
prevent my appearing to give her any
preference to the re&s;t of her &s;ex, yet I
have &s;een her blu&s;h at my civility to an|other.</P>
<P>She has at lea&s;t a friend&s;hip for me,
which alone would make the happine&s;s of
my life; and which I would prefer to the
love of the mo&s;t charming woman imagi|nation
could form, &s;en&s;ible as I am to the
&s;weete&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions: this friend&s;hip,

however, time and a&s;&s;iduity may ripen
into love; at lea&s;t I &s;hould be mo&s;t un|happy
if I did not think &s;o.</P>
<P>I love her with a tenderne&s;s of which

<P>YOU need be in no pain, my dear

my heart is in no danger from a man of his

and I believe his principles,
are worthy of your friend&s;hip; an enco|mium

her&s;elf: &s;he has not yet confe&s;&s;ed the fact
even to me; but &s;he has &s;peaking eyes,
Lucy, and I think I can interpret their
language.</P>
<P>Whether he &s;ees it or not I cannot tell;
I rather think he does, becau&s;e he has been
le&s;s here, and more guarded in his manner
when here, than before this matrimonial
affair was put an end to; which is natural
enough on that &s;uppo&s;ition, becau&s;e he
knows the impertinence of Quebec, and is
both prudent and delicate to a great degree.</P>
<P>He comes, however, and we are pretty
good company, only a little more re&s;erved

<P>EVERY hour, my Lucy, convinces me
more clearly there is no happine&s;s for
me without this lovely woman; her turn of
mind is &s;o corre&s;pondent to my own, that
we &s;eem to have but one &s;oul: the fir&s;t mo|ment
I &s;aw her the idea &s;truck me that we
had been friends in &s;ome pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate,
and were only renewing our acquaintance
here; when &s;he &s;peaks, my heart vibrates
to the &s;ound, and owns every thought &s;he
expre&s;&s;es a native there.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
The &s;ame dear affections, the &s;ame ten|der
&s;en&s;ibility, the mo&s;t precious gift of
Heaven, inform our minds, and make us
peculiarly capable of exqui&s;ite happine&s;s
or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions, my Lucy, are common to
all; but the affections, the lively &s;weet af|fections,
the only &s;ources of true plea&s;ure,
are the portion only of a cho&s;en few.</P>
<P>Uncertain at pre&s;ent of the nature of her
&s;entiments, I am determined to develop
them clearly before I di&s;cover mine: if &s;he
loves as I do, even a perpetual exile here
will be plea&s;ing. The remote&s;t wood in
Canada with her would be no longer a
de&s;ert wild; it would be the habitation of
the Graces.</P>
<P>But I forget your letter, my dear girl;
I am hurt beyond words at what you tell
me of my mother; and would in&s;tantly re|turn
to England, did not my fondne&s;s for
this charming woman detain me here: you
<PB N="52" REF="54">
are both too good in wi&s;hing to retire with
me to the country; will your tenderne&s;s
lead you a &s;tep farther, my Lucy? It
would be too much to hope to &s;ee you
here; and yet, if I marry Emily, it will
be impo&s;&s;ible for me to think of returning
to England.</P>
<P>There is a man here whom I &s;hould pre|fer
of all men I ever &s;aw for you; but he
is already attached to your friend Bell Fer|mor,
who is very inattentive to her own
happine&s;s, if &s;he refu&s;es him: I am very
happy in finding you think of Temple as
I wi&s;h you &s;hould.</P>
<P>You are &s;o very civil, Lucy, in regard
to me, I am afraid of becoming vain from
your prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Take care, my dear, you don't &s;poil me
by this exce&s;s of civility, for my only me|rit
is that of not being a coxcomb.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
I have a heavine&s;s of heart, which has
never left me &s;ince I read your letter: I
am &s;hocked at the idea of giving pain to
the be&s;t parent that ever exi&s;ted; yet have
le&s;s hope than ever of &s;eeing England,
without giving up the tender friend, the
dear companion, the adored mi&s;tre&s;s; in
&s;hort the very woman I have all my life
been in &s;earch of: I am al&s;o hurt that I
cannot place this object of all my wi&s;hes
in a &s;tation equal to that &s;he has rejected,
and I begin to think rejected for me.</P>
<P>I never before repined at &s;eeing the gifts
of fortune lavi&s;hed on the unworthy.</P>

I can write more chearfully.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Feb. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip does me great honor
in &s;uppo&s;ing me capable of giving
any &s;atisfactory account of a country in
which I have &s;pent only a few months.</P>
<P>As a proof, however, of my zeal, and
the very &s;trong de&s;ire I have to merit the
e&s;teem you honor me with, I &s;hall com|municate
from time to time the little I
have ob&s;erved, and may ob&s;erve, as well
as what I hear from good authority, with
that lively plea&s;ure with which I have ever
obeyed every command of your Lord|&s;hip's.</P>
<P>The French, in the fir&s;t &s;ettling this co|lony,
&s;eem to have had an eye only to the
conque&s;t of ours: their whole &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="55" REF="57">
policy &s;eems to have been military, not
commercial; or only &s;o far commercial as
was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the wants, and by
&s;o doing to gain the friend&s;hip, of the &s;a|vages,
in order to make u&s;e of them again&s;t
us.</P>
<P>The lands are held on military tenure:
every pea&s;ant is a &s;oldier, every &s;eigneur
an officer, and both &s;erve without pay
whenever called upon; this &s;ervice is, ex|cept
a very &s;mall quit-rent by way of ac|knowledgement,
all they pay for their
lands: the &s;eigneur holds of the crown,
the pea&s;ant of the &s;eigneur, who is at once
his lord and commander.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are in general tall and ro|bu&s;t,
notwith&s;tanding their exce&s;&s;ive indo|lence;
they love war, and hate labor; are
brave, hardy, alert in the field, but lazy
and inactive at home; in which they re&s;em|ble
the &s;avages, who&s;e manners they &s;eem
&s;trongly to have imbibed. The govern|ment
<PB N="56" REF="58">
appears to have encouraged a mili|tary
&s;pirit all over the colony; though ig|norant
and &s;tupid to a great degree, the&s;e
pea&s;ants have a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of honor; and
though they &s;erve, as I have &s;aid, without
pay, are never &s;o happy as when called to
the field.</P>
<P>They are exce&s;&s;ively vain, and not only
look on the French as the only civilized
nation in the world, but on them&s;elves as
the flower of the French nation: they had,
I am told, a great aver&s;ion to the regular
troops which came from France in the late
war, and a contempt equal to that aver|&s;ion;
they however had an affection and
e&s;teem for the late Marquis De Montcalm,
which almo&s;t ro&s;e to idolatry; and I have
even at this di&s;tance of time &s;een many of
them in tears at the mention of his name:
an hone&s;t tribute to the memory of a com|mander
equally brave and humane; for
whom his enemies wept even on the day
when their own hero fell.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">
I am called upon for this letter, and have

<DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 24,</DATE> Eleven at night.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE indeed, my dear, a plea&s;ure in
his conver&s;ation, to which words cannot
do ju&s;tice: love it&s;elf is le&s;s tender and
lively than my friend&s;hip for Rivers; from
the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw him, I lo&s;t all ta&s;te
for other conver&s;ation; even yours, ami|able
as you are, borrows its mo&s;t prevail|ing
<PB N="58" REF="60">
charm from the plea&s;ure of hearing
you talk of him.</P>
<P>When I call my tenderne&s;s for him
friend&s;hip, I do not mean either to paint
my&s;elf as an enemy to tenderer &s;entiments,
or him as one whom it is ea&s;y to &s;ee with|out
feeling them: all I mean is, that, as
our &s;ituations make it impo&s;&s;ible for us to
think of each other except as friends, I
have endeavored&mdash;I hope with &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;
to &s;ee him in no other light: it is not in
his power to marry without fortune, and
mine is a trifle: had I worlds, they &s;hould
be his; but, I am neither &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as to
de&s;ire, nor &s;o romantic as to expect, that
he &s;hould de&s;cend from the rank of life
he has been bred in, and live lo&s;t to the
world with me.</P>
<P>As to the impertinence of two or three
women, I hear of it with perfect indif|ference:
my dear Rivers e&s;teems me, he
approves my conduct, and all el&s;e is be|low
my care: the applau&s;e of worlds
<PB N="59" REF="61">
would give me le&s;s plea&s;ure than one &s;mile
of approbation from him.</P>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed your father &s;hould know
me &s;o little, as to &s;uppo&s;e me capable of
being influenced even by you: when I de|termined
to refu&s;e Sir George, it was from
the feelings of my own heart alone; the
fir&s;t moment I &s;aw Colonel Rivers con|vinced
me my heart had till then been a
&s;tranger to true tenderne&s;s: from that
moment my life has been one continued
&s;truggle between my rea&s;on, which &s;hewed
me the folly as well as indecency of marry|ing
one man when I &s;o infinitely preferred
another, and a fal&s;e point of honor and
mi&s;taken compa&s;&s;ion: from which painful
&s;tate, a concurrence of favorable accidents
has at length happily relieved me, and left
me free to act as becomes me.</P>
<P>Of this, my dear, be a&s;&s;ured, that,
though I have not the lea&s;t idea of ever
marrying Colonel Rivers, yet, whil&s;t my
<PB N="60" REF="62">
&s;entiments for him continue what they are,
I will never marry any other man.</P>
<P>I am hurt at what Mrs. Melmoth hinted
in her letter to you, of Rivers having ap|peared
to attach him&s;elf to me from vani|ty;
&s;he endeavors in vain to de&s;troy my
e&s;teem for him: you well know, he never
did appear to attach him&s;elf to me; he is
incapable of having done it from &s;uch a
motive; but if he had, &s;uch delight have
I in whatever plea&s;es him, that I &s;hould
with joy have &s;acrificed my own vanity to
gratify his.</P>

<P>THOSE who have heard no more
of a Canadian winter than what
regards the inten&s;ene&s;s of its cold, mu&s;t
&s;uppo&s;e it a very joyle&s;s &s;ea&s;on: 'tis,
I a&s;&s;ure you, quite otherwi&s;e; there are
indeed &s;ome days here of the &s;everity of
which tho&s;e who were never out of Eng|land
can form no conception; but tho&s;e
days &s;eldom exceed a dozen in a whole
winter; nor do they come in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but
at intermediate periods, as the winds &s;et
in from the North-We&s;t; which, coming
&s;ome hundred leagues, from frozen lakes
and rivers, over woods and mountains co|vered
with &s;now, would be in&s;upportable,
were it not for the furs with which the
country abounds, in &s;uch variety and
plenty as to be within the reach of all its
inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">
Thus defended, the Briti&s;h belles &s;et
the winter of Canada at defiance; and
the &s;ea&s;on of which you &s;eem to entertain
&s;uch terrible ideas, is that of the utmo&s;t
chearfulne&s;s and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>But what particularly plea&s;es me is,
there is no place where women are of &s;uch
importance: not one of the &s;ex, who has
the lea&s;t &s;hare of attractions, is without a
levee of beaux interceding for the honor
of attending her on &s;ome party, of
which every day produces three or
four.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from one of the
mo&s;t agreeable jaunts imagination can
paint, to the i&s;land of Orleans, by the
falls of Montmorenci; the latter is al|mo&s;t
nine miles di&s;tant, acro&s;s the great
ba&s;on of Quebec; but as we are obliged
to reach it in winter by the waving line,
our direct road being intercepted by the
inequalities of the ice, it is now perhaps
a third more. You will po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="72">
a ride of this kind mu&s;t want one of the
greate&s;t e&s;&s;entials to entertainment, that of
variety, and imagine it only one dull whirl
over an unvaried plain of &s;now: on the
contrary, my dear, we pa&s;s hills and
mountains of ice in the trifling &s;pace of
the&s;e few miles. The ba&s;on of Quebec
is formed by the conflux of the rivers St.
Charles and Montmorenci with the great
river St. Lawrence, the rapidity of who&s;e
flood-tide, as the&s;e rivers are gradually
&s;eized by the fro&s;t, breaks up the ice, and
drives it back in heaps, till it forms ridges
of tran&s;parent rock to an height that is
a&s;toni&s;hing, and of a &s;trength which bids
defiance to the utmo&s;t rage of the mo&s;t
furiou&s;ly ru&s;hing tide.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance makes this little jour|ney
more plea&s;ing than you can po&s;&s;ibly con|ceive:
the &s;erene blue &s;ky above, the daz|ling
brightne&s;s of the &s;un, and the colors
from the refraction of its rays on the tran&s;pa|rent
part of the&s;e ridges of ice, the wind|ing
cour&s;e the&s;e oblige you to make, the
<PB N="71" REF="73">
&s;udden di&s;appearing of a train of fifteen or
twenty carrioles, as the&s;e ridges intervene,
which again di&s;cover them&s;elves on your
ri&s;ing to the top of the frozen mount, the
tremendous appearance both of the a&s;cent
and de&s;cent, which however are not attend|ed
with the lea&s;t danger; all together give
a grandeur and variety to the &s;cene, which
almo&s;t ri&s;e to enchantment.</P>
<P>Your dull foggy climate affords nothing
that can give you the lea&s;t idea of our
fro&s;t pieces in Canada; nor can you form
any notion of our amu&s;ements, of the
agreeablene&s;s of a covered carriole, with
a &s;prightly fellow, rendered more &s;pright|ly
by the keen air and romantic &s;cene
about him; to &s;ay nothing of the fair lady
at his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Even an overturning has nothing a|larming
in it; you are laid gently down
on a &s;oft bed of &s;now, without the lea&s;t
danger of any kind; and an accident of
this &s;ort only gives a pretty fellow occa|&s;ion
<PB N="72" REF="74">

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Feb. 25,</DATE> Afternoon.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SO, my dear, as I was &s;aying, this &s;ame
ride to Montmorenci&mdash;where was I,
Lucy? I forget.&mdash;O, I believe pretty near
the mouth of the bay, embo&s;omed in
which lies the lovely ca&s;cade of which I
am to give you a winter de&s;cription, and
which I only &s;lightly mentioned when I
gave you an account of the rivers by
which it is &s;upplied.</P>
<P>The road, about a mile before you
reach this bay, is a regular gla&s;&s;y level,
without any of tho&s;e intervening hills of
ice which I have mentioned; hills, which
with the ideas, though fal&s;e ones, of dan|ger
and difficulty, give tho&s;e of beauty
and magnificence too.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
As you gradually approach the bay,
you are &s;truck with an awe, which in|crea&s;es
every moment, as you come near|er,
from the grandeur of a &s;cene, which
is one of the noble&s;t works of nature: the
beauty, the proportion, the &s;olemnity, the
wild magnificence of which, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing
every po&s;&s;ible effect of art, impre&s;s one
&s;trongly with the idea of its Divine Al|mighty
Architect.</P>
<P>The rock on the ea&s;t &s;ide, which is fir&s;t
in view as you approach, is a &s;mooth and
almo&s;t perpendicular precipice, of the
&s;ame height as the fall; the top, which a
little over-hangs, is beautifully covered
with pines, firs, and ever-greens of vari|ous
kinds, who&s;e verdant lu&s;tre is render|ed
at this &s;ea&s;on more &s;hining and lovely
by the &s;urrounding &s;now, as well as by that
which is &s;prinkled irregularly on their
branches, and glitters half melted in the
&s;un-beams: a thou&s;and &s;maller &s;hrubs are
&s;cattered on the &s;ide of the a&s;cent, and,
having their roots in almo&s;t impercepti|ble
<PB N="75" REF="77">
clefts of the rock, &s;eem to tho&s;e be|low
to grow in air.</P>
<P>The we&s;t &s;ide is equally lofty, but more
&s;loping, which, from that circum&s;tance,
affords &s;oil all the way, upon &s;helving in|equalities
of the rock, at little di&s;tances,
for the growth of trees and &s;hrubs, by
which it is almo&s;t entirely hid.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plea&s;ing view of this miracle
of nature is certainly in &s;ummer, and in
the early part of it, when every tree is in
foliage and full verdure, every &s;hrub in
flower; and when the river, &s;welled with a
wa&s;te of waters from the mountains from
which it derives its &s;ource, pours down in
a tumultuous torrent, that equally charms
and a&s;toni&s;hes the b$holder.</P>
<P>The winter &s;cene has, notwith&s;tanding,
its beauties, though of a different kind,
more re&s;embling the &s;tillne&s;s and inactivity
of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">
The river being on its &s;ides bound up in
fro&s;t, and its channel rendered narrower
than in the &s;ummer, affords a le&s;s body of
water to &s;upply the ca&s;cade; and the fall,
though very &s;teep, yet not being exactly
perpendicular, ma&s;&s;es of ice are formed,
on different &s;helving projections of the
rock, in a great variety of forms and pro|portions.</P>
<P>The torrent, which before ru&s;hed with
&s;uch impetuo&s;ity down the deep de&s;cent in
one va&s;t &s;heet of water, now de&s;cends in
&s;ome parts with a &s;low and maje&s;tic pace;
in others &s;eems almo&s;t &s;u&s;pended in mid
air; and in others, bur&s;ting through the
ob&s;tacles which interrupt its cour&s;e, pours
down with redoubled fury into the foam|ing
ba&s;on below, from whence a &s;pray
ari&s;es, which, freezing in its a&s;cent, be|comes
on each &s;ide a wide and irregular
frozen brea&s;t-work; and in front, the
&s;pray being there much greater, a lofty
and magnificent pyramid of &s;olid ice.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">
I have not told you half the grandeur,
half the beauty, half the lovely wildne&s;s
of this &s;cene: if you would know what it
is, you mu&s;t take no information but that
of your own eyes, which I pronounce
&s;trangers to the lovelie&s;t work of creation
till they have &s;een the river and fall of
Montmorenci.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear, I am Montmorenci|mad.</P>
<P>I can hardly de&s;cend to tell you, we
pa&s;&s;ed the ice from thence to Orleans, and
dined out of doors on &s;ix feet of &s;now, in
the charming enlivening warmth of the
&s;un, though in the month of February,
at a time when you in England &s;carce feel
his beams.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald made violent love to me all
the way, and I never felt my&s;elf li&s;ten
with &s;uch complacency.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">
Adieu! I have wrote two immen&s;e let|ters.
Write oftener; you are lazy, yet
expect me to be an ab&s;olute &s;lave in the
&s;cribbling way.</P>

<P>Do you know your brother has admir|able
ideas? He contrived to lo&s;e his way
on our return, and kept Emily ten mi|nutes
behind the re&s;t of the company. I
am apt to fancy there was &s;omething like
a declaration, for &s;he blu&s;hed,

<DATE>March 1.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS mi&s;taken, my dear; not a word
of love between your brother and
Emily, as &s;he po&s;itively a&s;&s;ures me; &s;ome|thing
very tender has pa&s;&s;ed, I am con|vinced,
notwith&s;tanding, for &s;he blu&s;hes
more than ever when he approaches, and
there is a certain &s;oftne&s;s in his voice when
he addre&s;&s;es her, which cannot e&s;cape a
per&s;on of my penetration.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear Lucy, that there
is a little impertinent girl here, a Made|moi&s;elle
Clairaut, who, on the mere merit
of features and complexion, &s;ets up for be|ing
as hand&s;ome as Emily and me?</P>
<P>If beauty, as I will take the liberty to
a&s;&s;ert, is given us for the purpo&s;e of plea&s;|ing,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
&s;he who plea&s;es mo&s;t, that is to &s;ay,
&s;he who excites the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, is to all
intents and purpo&s;es the mo&s;t beautiful
woman; and, in this ca&s;e, I am inclined to
believe your little Bell &s;tands pretty high
on the roll of beauty; the men's <HI>eyes</HI> may
perhaps <HI>&s;ay</HI> &s;he is hand&s;ome, but their
<HI>hearts feel</HI> that I am &s;o.</P>
<P>There is, in general, nothing &s;o in&s;ipid,
&s;o unintere&s;ting, as a Beauty; which tho&s;e
men experience to their co&s;t, who choo&s;e
from vanity, not inclination. I remem|ber
Sir Charles Herbert, a Captain in the
&s;ame regiment with my father, who deter|mined
to marry Mi&s;s Raymond before he
&s;aw her, merely becau&s;e he had been told
&s;he was a celebrated beauty, though &s;he
was never known to have in&s;pired a real
pa&s;&s;ion: he &s;aw her not with his own eyes
but tho&s;e of the public, took her charms
on tru&s;t; and, till he was her hu&s;band,
never found out &s;he was not his ta&s;te; a
&s;ecret, however, of &s;ome little importance
to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
I have, however, known &s;ome Beauties
who had a right to plea&s;e; that is, who had
a mixture of that invi&s;ible charm, that
namele&s;s grace which by no means depends
on beauty, and which &s;trikes the heart in
a moment; but my fir&s;t aver&s;ion is your
<HI>fine women:</HI> don't you think <HI>a fine woman</HI>
a dete&s;table creature, Lucy? I do: they
are va&s;tly well to <HI>fill</HI> public places: but as
to the heart&mdash;Heavens, my dear! yet there
are men, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be found, who
have a ta&s;te for the great &s;ublime in
beauty.</P>
<P>Men are va&s;tly fooli&s;h, my dear; very
few of them have &s;pirit to think for them|&s;elves;
there are a thou&s;and Sir Charles
Herberts: I have &s;een &s;ome of them weak
enough to decline marrying the woman
on earth mo&s;t plea&s;ing to them&s;elves, be|cau&s;e
not thought hand&s;ome by the gene|rality
of their companions.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
Women are above this folly, and there|fore
choo&s;e much oftener from affection
than men. We are a thou&s;and times
wi&s;er, Lucy, than the&s;e important beings,
the&s;e mighty lords,</P>
<LG>
<L>&startq;Who &s;trut and fret their hour upon
the &s;tage;&endq;</L>
</LG>
<P>and, in&s;tead of playing the part in life
which nature dictates to their rea&s;on and
their hearts, act a borrowed one at the will
of others.</P>

judge for my&s;elf.</P>

<P>AFTER debating with my&s;elf &s;ome
days, I am determined to pur&s;ue
Emily; but before I make a declaration,
will go to &s;ee &s;ome ungranted lands at the
back of Madame Des Roches's e&s;tate;
which, lying on a very fine river, and &s;o
near the St. Lawrence, may I think be
cultivated at le&s;s expence than tho&s;e above
Lake Champlain, though in a much infe|rior
climate: if I make my &s;ettlement
here, I will purcha&s;e the e&s;tate Madame
Des Roches has to &s;ell, which will open
me a road to the river St. Lawrence, and
con&s;equently treble the value of my
lands.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">
I love, I adore this charming woman;
but I will not &s;uffer my tenderne&s;s for
her to make her unhappy, or to lower her
&s;tation in life: if I can by my pre&s;ent
plan, &s;ecure her what will in this country
be a degree of affluence, I will endeavor
to change her friend&s;hip for me into a
tenderer and more lively affection; if &s;he
loves, I know by my own heart, that
Canada will be no longer a place of
exile; if I have flattered my&s;elf, and &s;he
has only a friend&s;hip for me, I will return
immediately to England, and retire with
you and my mother to our little e&s;tate
in the country.</P>
<P>You will perhaps &s;ay, why not make
Emily of our party? I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed
to &s;peak plain; but &s;o weak are we, and &s;o
guided by the prejudices we fancy we
de&s;pi&s;e, that I cannot bear my Emily, after
refu&s;ing a coach and &s;ix, &s;hould live without
an equipage &s;uitable at lea&s;t to her birth,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
and the manner in which &s;he has always
lived when in England.</P>
<P>I know this is folly, that it is a de&s;pi|cable
pride; but it is a folly, a pride, I
cannot conquer.</P>
<P>There are moments when I am above
all this childi&s;h prejudice, but it returns
upon me in &s;pite of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Will you come to us, my Lucy? Tell
my mother, I will build her a ru&s;tic pa|lace,
and &s;ettle a little principality on you
both.</P>
<P>I make this a private excur&s;ion, becau&s;e
I don't choo&s;e any body &s;hould even gue&s;s
at my views. I &s;hall &s;et out in the even|ing,
and make a circuit to cro&s;s the river
above the town.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not even take leave at Silleri, as
I propo&s;e being back in four days, and I
<PB N="86" REF="88">
know your friend Bell will be inqui&s;itive
about my journey.</P>

<P>YOUR brother is gone nobody knows
whither, and without calling upon
us before he &s;et off; we are piqued,
I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, and with &s;ome
little rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Four o'clock.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">
Very &s;trange news, Lucy; they &s;ay
Colonel Rivers is gone to marry Madame
Des Roches, a lady at who&s;e hou&s;e he was
&s;ome time in autumn; if this is true, I
for&s;wear the whole &s;ex: his manner of
&s;tealing off is certainly very odd, and &s;he
is rich and agreeable; but, if he does not
love Emily, he has been exce&s;&s;ively cruel
in &s;hewing an attention which has de|ceived
her into a pa&s;&s;ion for him. I can|not
believe it po&s;&s;ible: not that he has
ever told her he loved her; but a man of
honour will not tell an untruth even with
his eyes, and his have &s;poke a very une|quivocal
language.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw any thing like her confu|&s;ion,
when &s;he was told he was gone to
vi&s;it Madame Des Roches; but, when it
was hinted with what de&s;ign, I was obli|ged
to take her out of the room, or &s;he
would have di&s;covered all the fondne&s;s of
<PB N="88" REF="90">
her &s;oul. I really thought &s;he would
have fainted as I led her out.</P>
<P>Eight o'clock.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent away all the men, and drank
tea in Emily's apartment; &s;he has &s;carce
&s;poke to me; I am mi&s;erable for her; &s;he
has a palene&s;s which alarms me, the tears
&s;teal every moment into her lovely eyes.
Can Rivers act &s;o unworthy a part? her
tenderne&s;s cannot have been unob&s;erved
by him; it was too vi&s;ible to every body.</P>
<P>9th, Ten o'clock.</P>
<P>Not a line from your brother yet;
only a confirmation of his being with
Madame Des Roches, having been &s;een
there by &s;ome Canadians who are come
up this morning: I am not quite plea&s;ed,
though I do not believe the report; he
might have told us &s;urely where he was
going.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91">
I pity Emily beyond words; &s;he &s;ays
nothing, but there is a dumb eloquence
in her countenance which is not to be de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I have been an hour alone with the dear
little girl, who has, from a hint I dropt
on purpo&s;e, taken courage to &s;peak to me
on this very intere&s;ting &s;ubject; &s;he &s;ays,
&startq;&s;he &s;hall be mo&s;t unhappy if this re|port
is true, though without the lea&s;t
right to complain of Colonel Rivers,
who never even hinted a word of any
affection for her more tender than
friend&s;hip; that if her vanity, her &s;elf|love,
or her tenderne&s;s, have deceived
her, &s;he ought only to blame her&s;elf.&endq;
She added, &startq;that &s;he wi&s;hed him to
marry Madame Des Roches, if &s;he
could make him happy;&endq; but when &s;he
&s;aid this, an involuntary tear &s;eemed to
contradict the genero&s;ity of her &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
I beg your pardon, my dear, but my
e&s;teem for your brother is greatly le&s;&s;en|ed;
I cannot help fearing there is &s;ome|thing
in the report, and that this is what
Mrs. Melmoth meant when &s;he men|tioned
his having an attachment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin to hate the whole &s;ex,
Lucy, if I find your brother unworthy,
and &s;hall give Fitzgerald his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion
immediately.</P>
<P>I am afraid Mrs. Melmoth knows men
better than we fooli&s;h girls do: &s;he &s;aid,
he attached him&s;elf to Emily merely from
vanity, and I begin to believe &s;he was
right: how cruel is this conduct! The
man who from vanity, or perhaps only to
amu&s;e an idle hour, can appear to be at|tached
where he is not, and by that
means &s;educe the heart of a de&s;erving wo|man,
or indeed of any woman, falls in
my opinion very little &s;hort in ba&s;ene&s;s of
him who practi&s;es a greater degree of &s;e|duction.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">
What right has he to make the mo&s;t
amiable of women wretched? a woman
who would have de&s;erved him had he
been monarch of the univer&s;al world! I
might add, who has &s;acrificed ea&s;e and
affluence to her tenderne&s;s for him?</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e my warmth on &s;uch an
occa&s;ion; however, as it may give you
pain, I will &s;ay no more.</P>

<P>I Have met with &s;omething, my dear
Lucy, which has given me infinite
unea&s;ine&s;s; Madame Des Roches, from
my extreme zeal to &s;erve her in an affair
wherein &s;he has been hardly u&s;ed, from
my &s;econd vi&s;it, and a certain involun|tary
attention, and &s;oftne&s;s of manner, I
have to all women, has &s;uppo&s;ed me in
love with her, and with a frankne&s;s I can|not
but admire, and a delicacy not to be
de&s;cribed, has let me know I am far from
being indifferent to her.</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t extremely embarra&s;&s;ed;
but when I had reflected a moment, I con|&s;idered
that the ladies, tho' another may
be the object, always regard with a kind
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of complacency a man who <HI>loves,</HI> as one
who acknowledges the power of the &s;ex,
whereas an indifferent is a kind of rebel
to their empire; I con&s;idered al&s;o that the
confe&s;&s;ion of a prior inclination &s;aves the
mo&s;t delicate vanity from being wounded;
and therefore determined to make her the
confidante of my tenderne&s;s for Emily;
leaving her an opening to &s;uppo&s;e that, if
my heart had been di&s;engaged, it could
not have e&s;caped her attractions.</P>
<P>I did this with all po&s;&s;ible precaution,
and with every &s;oftening that friend&s;hip and
politene&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t; &s;he was &s;hocked
at my confe&s;&s;ion, but &s;oon recovered her|&s;elf
enough to tell me &s;he was highly flat|tered
by this proof of my confidence and
e&s;teem; that &s;he believed me a man to
have only the more re&s;pect for a woman
who by owning her partiality had told
me &s;he con&s;idered me not only as the
mo&s;t amiable, but the mo&s;t noble
of my &s;ex; that &s;he had heard, no
love was &s;o tender as that which was the
<PB N="94" REF="96">
child of friend&s;hip; but that of this &s;he
was convinced, that no friend&s;hip was &s;o
tender as that which was the child of
love; that &s;he offered me this tender, this
lively friend&s;hip, and would for the fu|ture
find her happine&s;s in the con&s;idera|tion
of mine.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear, that &s;ince this
confe&s;&s;ion, I feel a kind of tenderne&s;s for
her, to which I cannot give a name? It is
not love; for I love, I idolize another:
but it is &s;ofter and more plea&s;ing, as well
as more animated, than friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive what plea&s;ure I
find in her conver&s;ation; &s;he has an ad|mirable
under&s;tanding, a feeling heart,
and a mixture of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;pirit in her
manner, which is peculiarly plea&s;ing to
men. My Emily will love her; I mu&s;t
bring them acquainted: &s;he promi&s;es to
come to Quebec in May; I &s;hall be happy
to &s;hew her every attention when there.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">
I have &s;een the lands, and am plea&s;ed
with them: I believe this will be my re|&s;idence,
if Emily, as I cannot avoid
hoping, will make me happy; I &s;hall de|clare
my&s;elf as &s;oon as I return, but mu&s;t
continue here a few days longer: I &s;hall
not be le&s;s plea&s;ed with this &s;ituation for
its being &s;o near Madame Des Roches, in
whom Emily will find a friend worthy of
her e&s;teem, and an entertaining lively

<P>STILL with Madame Des Roches;
appearances are rather again&s;t him,
you mu&s;t own, Lucy: but I will not &s;ay
all I think to you. Poor Emily! we
di&s;pute continually, for &s;he will per&s;i&s;t in
defending his conduct; &s;he &s;ays, he has
a right to marry whoever he plea&s;es; that
her loving him is no tie upon his honor,
e&s;pecially as he does not even know of this
preference; that &s;he ought only to blame
the weakne&s;s of her own heart, which has
betrayed her into a fal&s;e belief that their
tenderne&s;s was mutual: this is pretty talk|ing,

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I GENERALLY di&s;tru&s;t my own opi|nion
when it differs from your Lord|&s;hip's;
but in this in&s;tance I am mo&s;t cer|tainly
in the right: allow me to &s;ay, no|thing
can be more ill-judged than your
Lord&s;hip's de&s;ign of retiring into a &s;mall
circle, from that world of which you have
&s;o long been one of the mo&s;t brilliant or|naments.
What you &s;ay of the di&s;agree|ablene&s;s
of age, is by no means applicable
to your Lord&s;hip; nothing is in this re|&s;pect
&s;o fallible as the pari&s;h regi&s;ter.
Why &s;hould any man retire from &s;ociety
whil&s;t he is capable of contributing to the
plea&s;ures of it? Wit, vivacity, good-na|ture,
and politene&s;s, give an eternal youth,
as &s;tupidity and moro&s;ene&s;s a premature
<PB N="99" REF="101">
old age. Without a thou&s;andth part of
your Lord&s;hip's &s;hining qualities, I think
my&s;elf much younger than half the boys
about me, merely becau&s;e I have more
good-nature, and a &s;tronger de&s;ire of
plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>My daughter is much honored by your
Lord&s;hip's enquiries: &s;he is Bell Fermor
&s;till; but is addre&s;&s;ed by a gentleman who
is extremely agreeable to me, and I believe
not le&s;s &s;o to her; I however know too well
the free &s;pirit of woman, of which &s;he has
her full &s;hare, to let Bell know I ap|prove
her choice; I am even in doubt
whether it would not be good policy to
&s;eem to di&s;like the match, in order to &s;e|cure
her con&s;ent; there is &s;omething very
plea&s;ing to a young girl, in oppo&s;ing the
will of her father.</P>
<P>To &s;peak truth, I am a little out of hu|mor
with her at pre&s;ent, for having con|tributed,
and I believe entirely from a &s;pi|rit
of oppo&s;ition to me, to break a match
<PB N="100" REF="102">
on which I had extremely &s;et my heart;
the lady was the niece of my particular
friend, and one of the mo&s;t lovely and de|&s;erving
women I ever knew: the gentle|man
very worthy, with an agreeable, in|deed
a very hand&s;ome per&s;on, and a for|tune
which with tho&s;e who know the
world, would have compen&s;ated for the
want of mo&s;t other advantages.</P>
<P>The fair lady, after an engagement of
two years, took a whim that there was no
happine&s;s in marriage without being mad|ly
in love, and that her pa&s;&s;ion was not
&s;ufficiently romantic; in which piece of
folly my rebel encouraged her, and the
affair broke off in a manner which has
brought on her the imputation of having
given way to an idle prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in fa|vor
of another.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will excu&s;e my talking
on a &s;ubject very near my heart, though
unintere&s;ting to you; I have too often ex|perienced
your Lord&s;hip's indulgence to
<PB N="101" REF="103">
doubt it on this occa&s;ion: your good-na|tured
philo&s;ophy will tell you, much fewer
people talk or write to amu&s;e or inform
their friends, than to give way to the feel|ings
of their own hearts, or indulge the
governing pa&s;&s;ion of the moment.</P>
<P>In my next, I will endeavor in the be&s;t
manner I can, to obey your Lord&s;hip's
commands in regard to the political and
religious &s;tate of Canada: I will make a
point of getting the be&s;t information po&s;|&s;ible;
what I have yet &s;een, has been only
the &s;urface.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 16,</DATE> Monday.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR brother is come back; and has
been here: he came after dinner ye&s;|terday.
My Emily is more than woman;
I am proud of her behaviour: he entered
with his u&s;ual impatient air; &s;he received
him with a dignity which a&s;toni&s;hed me,
and di&s;concerted him: there was a cool di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate
indifference in her whole man|ner,
which I &s;aw cut his vanity to the
quick, and for which he was by no means
prepared.</P>
<P>On &s;uch an occa&s;ion I &s;hould have flirt|ed
violently with &s;ome other man, and
have &s;hewed plainly I was piqued: &s;he
judged much better; I have only to wi&s;h
<PB N="103" REF="105">
it may la&s;t. He is the verie&s;t coquet in
nature; for, after all, I am convinced he
loves Emily.</P>
<P>He &s;tayed a very little time, and has
not been here this morning; he may pout
if he plea&s;es, but I flatter my&s;elf we &s;hall
hold out the longe&s;t.</P>
<P>Nine o'clock.</P>
<P>He came to dine; we kept up our &s;tate
all dinner time; he begged a moment's
conver&s;ation, which we refu&s;ed, but with
a timid air that makes me begin to fear
we &s;hall beat a parley: he is this moment
gone, and Emily retired to her apartment
on pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition: I am afraid
&s;he is a fooli&s;h girl.</P>
<P>Half hour after &s;ix.</P>
<P>It will not do, Lucy: I found her in
tears at the window, following Rivers's
carriole with her eyes: &s;he turned to me
with &s;uch a look&mdash;in &s;hort, my dear,</P>
<Q><PB N="104" REF="106">
&startq;The weak, the fond, the fool, the
coward woman&endq;</Q>
<P>has prevailed over all her re&s;olution: her
love is only the more violent for having
been a moment re&s;trained; &s;he is not
equal to the ta&s;k &s;he has undertaken; her
re&s;entment was concealed tenderne&s;s, and
has retaken its fir&s;t form.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to find there is not one wi&s;e
woman in the world but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pa&s;t ten.</P>
<P>I have been with her again: &s;he &s;eemed
a little calmer; I commended her &s;pirit;
&s;he di&s;avowed it; was peevi&s;h with me,
angry with her&s;elf; &s;aid &s;he had acted in
a manner unworthy her character; accu&s;|ed
her&s;elf of caprice, artifice, and cru|elty;
&s;aid &s;he ought to have &s;een him, if
not alone, yet with me only: that it was
natural he &s;hould be &s;urprized at a recep|tion
&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with true friend&s;hip,
and therefore that he &s;hould wi&s;h an ex|planation;
<PB N="105" REF="107">
that <HI>her</HI> Rivers (and why not
Madame Des Roches's Rivers?) was in|capable
of acting otherwi&s;e than as became
the be&s;t and mo&s;t tender of mankind, and
that therefore &s;he ought not to have &s;uf|fered
a whi&s;per injurious to his honor:
that I had meant well, but had, by de|priving
her of Rivers's friend&s;hip, which
&s;he had lo&s;t by her haughty behaviour,
de&s;troyed all the happine&s;s of her life.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, your poor Bell is always
to blame: but if ever I intermeddle be|tween
lovers again, Lucy&mdash;</P>
<P>I am &s;ure &s;he was ten times more angry
with him than I was, but this it is to be

<P>I CANNOT account, my dear, for what
has happened to me. I left Madame
Des Roches's full of the warm impatience

I was received with a di&s;dainful coldne&s;s

<P>I AM &s;orry, my dear Madam, you
&s;hould know &s;o little of my heart, as
to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible I could have broke
my engagements with Sir George from
any motive but the full conviction of my
wanting that tender affection for him, and
that lively ta&s;te for his conver&s;ation, which
alone could have in&s;ured either his feli|city
or my own; happy is it for both that
I di&s;covered this before it was too late:
it was a very unplea&s;ing circum&s;tance,
even under an intention only of marrying
him, to find my friend&s;hip &s;tronger for
another; what then would it have been
under the mo&s;t &s;acred of all engagements,
that of marriage? What wretchedne&s;s
would have been the portion of both, had
<PB N="113" REF="115">
timidity, decorum, or fal&s;e honor, carried
me, with this partiality in my heart, to
fulfill tho&s;e views, entered into from com|pliance
to my family, and continued from
a fal&s;e idea of propriety, and weak fear of
the cen&s;ures of the world?</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;on therefore &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing,
nay being every moment &s;tronger,
from a fuller conviction of the merit of
him my heart prefers, in &s;pite of me, to
Sir George, our union is more impo&s;&s;ible
than ever.</P>
<P>I am however obliged to you, and Ma|jor
Melmoth, for your zeal to &s;erve me,
though you mu&s;t permit me to call it a
mi&s;taken one; and to Sir George, for a
conce&s;&s;ion, which I own I &s;hould not have
made in his &s;ituation, and which I can
only &s;uppo&s;e the effect of Major Mel|moth's
per&s;ua&s;ions, which he might &s;up|po&s;e
were known to me, and an imagina|tion
that my &s;entiments for him were
<PB N="114" REF="116">
changed: a&s;&s;ure him of my e&s;teem, tho'
love is not in my power.</P>
<P>As Colonel Rivers never gave me the
remote&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e him more than
my friend, I have not the lea&s;t right to
di&s;approve his marrying: on the contrary,
as his friend, I <HI>ought</HI> to wi&s;h a connexion
which I am told is greatly to his advan|tage.</P>
<P>To prevent all future importunity,
painful to me, and, all circum&s;tances con|&s;idered,
degrading to Sir George, who&s;e
honor is very dear to me, though I am
obliged to refu&s;e him that hand which he
&s;urely cannot wi&s;h to receive without my
heart, I am compelled to &s;ay, that, with|out
an idea of ever being united to
Colonel Rivers, I will never marry any
other man.</P>
<P>Were I never again to behold him, were
he even the hu&s;band of another, my ten|derne&s;s,
<PB N="115" REF="117">
a tenderne&s;s as innocent as it is
lively, would never cea&s;e: nor would I
give up the refined delight of loving him,
independently of any hope of being be|loved,
for any advantage in the power of
fortune to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The&s;e being my &s;entiments, &s;entiments
which no time can alter, they cannot be
too &s;oon known to Sir George: I would
not one hour keep him in &s;u&s;pence in a
point, which this &s;tep &s;eems to &s;ay is of
con&s;equence to his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Tell him, I entreat him to forget me,
and to come into views which will make
his mother, and I have no doubt him&s;elf,
happier than a marriage with a woman
who&s;e chief merit is that very &s;incerity of

<P>THE coldne&s;s of which I complained,
my dear Lucy, in regard to Emily,
was the mo&s;t flattering circum&s;tance which
could have happened: I will not &s;ay it
<PB N="121" REF="123">

a certain inexpre&s;&s;ible melting languor, a

have felt?</P>

charming languor change to a joy which
animated her whole form, and of which I
was &s;o happy as to believe my&s;elf the
cau&s;e: my eyes had told her all that
pa&s;&s;ed in my heart; hers had &s;hewed me
plainly they under&s;tood their language.

<P>I HAVE been telling Fitzgerald I am
jealous of his prodigious attention to
Emily, who&s;e ceci&s;beo he has been the la&s;t
ten days: the &s;impleton took me &s;eriou&s;ly,
and began to vindicate him&s;elf, by ex|plaining
the nature of his regard for her,
pleading her late indi&s;po&s;ition as an ex|cu&s;e
for &s;hewing her &s;ome extraordi|nary
civilities.</P>
<P>I let him harangue ten minutes, then
&s;tops me him &s;hort, puts on my poetical
face, and repeats,</P>
<LG>
<L>&startq;When &s;weet Emily complains,</L>
<L>I have &s;en&s;e of all her pains;</L>
<L>But for little Bella, I</L>

<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
He &s;miled, ki&s;&s;ed my hand, prai&s;ed my
amazing penetration, and was going to
take this opportunity of &s;aying a thou|&s;and
civil things, when my divine Rivers
appeared on the &s;ide of the hill; I flew to
meet him, and left my love to fini&s;h the
conver&s;ation alone.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I am the happie&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible wo|men;
Fitzgerald is in the &s;ullens about
your brother; &s;urely there is no plea&s;ure
in nature equal to that of plaguing a fel|low
who really loves one, e&s;pecially if he
has as much merit as Fitzgerald, for other|wi&s;e
he would not be worth tormenting.
He had better not pout with me: I be|lieve
I know who will be tired fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t delicious day:
Fitzgerald took it into his wi&s;e head to
<PB N="126" REF="128">
endeavor to make me jealous of a little
pert Frenchwoman, the wife of a Croix
de St. Louis, who I know he de&s;pi&s;es; I
then thought my&s;elf at full liberty to
play off all my airs, which I did with in|effable
&s;ucce&s;s, and have &s;ent him home
in a humor to hang him&s;elf. Your bro|ther
&s;tays the evening, &s;o does a very
hand&s;ome fellow I have been flirting with
all the day: Fitz was engaged here too,
but I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
not to attend Madame La Bro&s;&s;e to Que|bec;
he looked at me with a &s;pite in his
countenance which charmed me to the
&s;oul, and handed the fair lady to his car|riole.</P>
<P>I'll teach him to coquet, Lucy; let
him take his Madame La Bro&s;&s;e: indeed,
as her hu&s;band is at Montreal, I don't

<P>I AM afraid you knew very little of the

me &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t loving Mr.

Temple: I &s;hould perhaps, with all his

for that caution.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very intere&s;ting to
female curio&s;ity in the idea of the&s;e very
formidable men, whom no woman can
&s;ee without danger; we gaze on the ter|rible

in him &s;o very alarming; he approaches,
our little hearts palpitate with fear, he

not with fear.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear brother, if you wi&s;h

the mo&s;t dangerous of his &s;ex; the very
idea that he is &s;o, makes us think re&s;i&s;t|ance
vain, and we throw down our de|&s;en&s;ive

<P><PB N="130" REF="132">
I am not &s;ure this is the rea&s;on of my

that I love him with the mo&s;t lively affec|tion,

<P>Indeed, my dear prudent brother,
you men fancy your&s;elves extremely

me for accepting an agreeable fellow, and

<P>WERE I convinced of your con|ver&s;ion,
my dear Jack, I &s;hould

thought of your marrying my &s;i&s;ter; but
I tremble le&s;t this re&s;olution &s;hould be
the effect of pa&s;&s;ion merely, and not of

without which mutual repentance will

<P>Lucy is one of the mo&s;t beautiful wo|men

<P>I HAVE received your &s;econd letter,
my dear Temple, with the account of
your marriage.</P>
<P>Nothing could make me &s;o happy as an
event which unites a &s;i&s;ter I idolize to the
friend on earth mo&s;t dear to me, did I not
tremble for your future happine&s;s, from
my perfect knowledge of both.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137">
I know the &s;en&s;ibility of Lucy's temper,
and that &s;he loves you: I know al&s;o the
difficulty of weaning the heart from &s;uch
a habit of incon&s;tancy as you have unhap|pily
acquired.</P>
<P>Virtues like Lucy's will for ever com|mand
your e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; but in
marriage it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to keep
love alive: her beauty, her gaiety, her de|licacy,
will do much; but it is al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
my deare&s;t Temple, that you
keep a guard on your heart, accu&s;tomed
to liberty, to give way to every light
impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, who have experi|enced
the truth of what I &s;ay, that happi|ne&s;s
is not to be found in a life of intrigue;
there is no real plea&s;ure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of beauty without the heart; with it, the
fears, the anxieties, a man not ab&s;olutely
de&s;titute of humanity mu&s;t feel for the
<PB N="136" REF="138">
honor of her who ventures more than life
for him, mu&s;t extremely counterbalance
his tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>Of all the &s;ituations this world affords,
a marriage of choice gives the faire&s;t pro&s;|pect
of happine&s;s; without love, life would
be a ta&s;tele&s;s void; an unconnected hu|man
being is the mo&s;t wretched of all crea|tures:
by love I would be under&s;tood to
mean that tender lively friend&s;hip, that
mixed &s;en&s;ation, which the libertine never
felt; and with which I flatter my&s;elf my
amiable &s;i&s;ter cannot fail of in&s;piring a
heart naturally virtuous, however at pre|&s;ent
warped by a fooli&s;h compliance with
the world.</P>
<P>I hope, my dear Temple, to &s;ee you re|cover
your ta&s;te for tho&s;e plea&s;ures pecu|liarly
fitted to our natures; to &s;ee you en|joy
the pure delights of peaceful dome&s;tic
life, the calm &s;ocial evening hour, the
circle of friends, the prattling offspring,
<PB N="137" REF="139">
and the tender impa&s;&s;ioned &s;mile of real
love.</P>
<P>Your genero&s;ity is no more than I ex|pected
from your character; and to con|vince
you of my perfect e&s;teem, I &s;o far
accept it, as to draw out the money I
have in the funds, which I intended for
my &s;i&s;ter: it will make my &s;ettlement here
turn to greater advantage, and I allow
you the plea&s;ure of convincing Lucy of
the perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of your af|fection:
it would be a trifle to you, and
will make me happy.</P>
<P>But I am more delicate in regard to my
mother, and will never con&s;ent to re&s;ume
the e&s;tate I have &s;ettled on her: I e&s;teem
you above all mankind, but will not let
<HI>her</HI> be dependent even on you: I con&s;ent
&s;he vi&s;it you as often as &s;he plea&s;es, but
in&s;i&s;t on her continuing her hou&s;e in
town, and living in every re&s;pect as &s;he
has been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">
As to Lucy's own little fortune, as it
is not worth your receiving, &s;uppo&s;e &s;he
lays it out in jewels? I love to &s;ee
beauty adorned; and two thou&s;and
pounds, added to what you have given
her, will &s;et her on a footing in this
re&s;pect with a nabobe&s;s.</P>
<P>Your marriage, my dear Temple, re|moves
the &s;tronge&s;t objection to mine;
the money I have in the funds, which
whil&s;t Lucy was unmarried I never
would have taken, enables me to fix
to great advantage here. I have now
only to try whether Emily's friend&s;hip
for me is &s;ufficiently &s;trong to give up
all hopes of a return to England.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make an immediate trial: you
&s;hall know the event in a few days. If
&s;he refu&s;es me, I bid adieu to all my
&s;chemes, and embark in the fir&s;t &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">

<P>Good people, as your Lord&s;hip ob|&s;erves,

<P>'Tis to that circum&s;tance, I am per|&s;uaded,

<P>Virtue is too lovely to be hid in cells,

to me the account he has received of your

<P>Make my congratulations to the dear

'tis very well; I don't think I &s;hall
break my heart, though my vanity is a
little piqued. I may perhaps live to take
my revenge.</P>
<P>I am hurt, becau&s;e I began really

<OPENER>To Mrs. TEMPLE, Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>28th March.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD this morning a &s;hort billet from
her dear hand, entreating me to make
up a quarrel between Bell Fermor and her
lover: your friend has been indi&s;creet;
her &s;pirit of coquetry is eternally carrying
her wrong; but in my opinion Fitzgerald
has been at lea&s;t equally to blame.</P>
<P>His behaviour at the governor's on
Thur&s;day night was inexcu&s;able, as it
expo&s;ed her to the &s;neers of a whole circle
of her own &s;ex, many of them jealous of
her perfections.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155">
A lover &s;hould overlook little caprices,
where the heart is good and amiable like
Bell's: I &s;hould think my&s;elf particu|larly
obliged to bring this affair to an
amicable conclu&s;ion, even if Emily had
not de&s;ired it, as I was originally the in|nocent
cau&s;e of their quarrel. In my
opinion he ought to beg her pardon;
and, as a friend tenderly intere&s;ted for
both, I have a right to tell him I think
&s;o: he loves her, and I know mu&s;t &s;uffer
greatly, though a fooli&s;h pride prevents
his acknowledging it.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t fear is, that an idle re&s;ent|ment
may engage him in an intrigue with
the lady in que&s;tion, who is a woman of
gallantry, and whom he may find very
trouble&s;ome hereafter. It is much ea&s;ier
to commence an affair of this kind than
to break it off; and a man, though his
heart was di&s;engaged, &s;hould be always
on his guard again&s;t any thing like an
attachment where his affections are not
really intere&s;ted: mere pa&s;&s;ion or mere
<PB N="154" REF="156">
vanity will &s;upport an affair <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant;</HI>
but, where the lea&s;t degree of con&s;tancy
and attention are expected, the heart mu&s;t
feel, or the lover is &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to
a &s;lavery as irk&s;ome as a marriage with|out
inclination.</P>
<P>Temple will tell you I &s;peak like an
oracle; for I have often &s;een him led by
vanity into this very di&s;agreeable &s;itua|tion:
I hope I am not too late to &s;ave
Fitzgerald from it.</P>
<P>Six in the evening.</P>
<P>All goes well: his proud heart is come
down, he has begged her pardon, and is
forgiven; you have no idea how civil
both are to me, for having per&s;uaded
them to do what each of them has longed
to do from the fir&s;t moment: I love to
advi&s;e, when I am &s;ure the heart of the
per&s;on advi&s;ed is on my &s;ide. Both were
<PB N="155" REF="157">
to blame, but I always love to &s;ave the
ladies from any thing mortifying to the
dignity of their characters; a little pride
in love becomes them, but not us; and
'tis always our part to &s;ubmit on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw two happier people than
they are at pre&s;ent, as I have a little
pre&s;erved decorum on both &s;ides, and
taken the whole trouble of the recon|ciliation
on my&s;elf&punc; Bell knows nothing
of my having applied to Fitzgerald, nor
he that I did it at Emily's reque&s;t: my
conver&s;ation with him on this &s;ubject
&s;eemed accidental. I was obliged to
leave them, having bu&s;ine&s;s in town;
but my lovely Emily thanked me by a
&s;mile which would overpay a thou&s;and
&s;uch little &s;ervices.</P>

<P>FITZGERALD has been here, and
has begged my pardon; he declares
he had no thought of di&s;plea&s;ing me at
the governor's, but from my behaviour
was afraid of importuning me if he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
me as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>I thought who would come to fir&s;t; for
my part, if he had &s;tayed away for ever, I
would not have &s;uffered papa to invite him
to Silleri: it was ea&s;y to &s;ee his neglect was
all pique; it would have been extraordi|nary
<PB N="157" REF="159">
indeed if &s;uch a woman as Madame
La Bro&s;&s;e could have rivalled me: I am
&s;omething younger; and, if either my
gla&s;s or the men are to be believed,
as hand&s;ome: <HI>entre nous,</HI> there is &s;ome
little difference; if &s;he was not &s;o
very fair, &s;he would be ab&s;olutely ug|ly:
and the&s;e very fair women, you
know, Lucy, are always in&s;ipid; &s;he
is the ta&s;te of no man breathing, though
eternally making advances to every man;
without &s;pirit, fire, under&s;tanding, vi|vacity,
or any quality capable of mak|ing
amends for the mediocrity of her
charms.</P>
<P>Her in&s;olence in attempting to attach
Fitzgerald is intolerable, e&s;pecially when
the whole province knows him to be my
lover: there is no expre&s;&s;ing to what a
degree I hate her.</P>
<P>The next time we meet I hope to re|turn
her impertinence on Thur&s;day night
at the governor's: I will never forgive
<PB N="158" REF="160">
Fitzgerald if he takes the lea&s;t notice of
her.</P>
<P>Emily has read my letter; and &s;ays &s;he
did not think I had &s;o much of the wo|man
in me; in&s;i&s;ts on my being civil to
Madame La Bro&s;&s;e, but if I am, Lucy&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e Frenchwomen are not to be &s;up|ported;
they fancy vanity and a&s;&s;urance
are to make up for the want of every
other virtue; forgetting that delicacy,
&s;oftne&s;s, &s;en&s;ibility, tenderne&s;s, are at|tractions
to which they are &s;trangers:
&s;ome of them here are however tole|rably
hand&s;ome, and have a degree of
liveline&s;s which makes them not quite in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>You will call all this &s;pite, as Emily
does, &s;o I will &s;ay no more: only that, in
order to &s;hew her how very ea&s;y it is to
be civil to a rival, I wi&s;h for the plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing another French lady, that I

me beyond words, my dear Bell, by
your vi&s;it of ye&s;terday: Madame Des
Roches is charmed with you both:
you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed when I tell
you &s;he gives Emily the preference;
&s;he &s;ays &s;he is beautiful as an angel;
that &s;he &s;hould think the man in&s;en&s;i|ble,
who could &s;ee her without love;
that &s;he is <HI>touchant,</HI> to u&s;e her own
word, beyond any thing &s;he ever be|held.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="176">
&startq;She however does ju&s;tice to your
charms, though Emily's &s;eem to affect
her mo&s;t. She even allows you to be
perhaps more the ta&s;te of men in gene|ral.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She intends paying her re&s;pects to
you and Emily this afternoon; and
has &s;ent to de&s;ire me to conduct her.
As it is &s;o far, I would wi&s;h to find
you at home.&endq;</P>

<P>ALWAYS Madame Des Roches! but

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are going to dine at a farm-hou&s;e
in the country, where we are to
meet other company, and have a ball: the
&s;now begins a little to &s;often, from the
warmth of the &s;un, which is greater than
in England in May. Our winter parties
are almo&s;t at an end.</P>
<P>My father drives Madame Des Roches,
who is of our party, and your brother
Emily; I hope the little fool will be ea&s;y
now, Lucy; &s;he is very humble, to be
jealous of one, who, though really very
plea&s;ing, is neither &s;o young nor &s;o hand|&s;ome
as her&s;elf; and who profe&s;&s;es to wi&s;h
only for Rivers's friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
But I have no right to &s;ay a word
on this &s;ubject, after having been &s;o ex|tremely
hurt at Fitzgerald's attention to
&s;uch a woman as Madame La Bro&s;&s;e; an
attention too which was &s;o plainly meant
to pique me.</P>
<P>We are all, I am afraid, a little ab|&s;urd
in the&s;e affairs, and therefore ought
to have &s;ome degree of indulgence for
others.</P>
<P>Emily and I, however, differ in our
ideas of love: it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of her life,
the amu&s;ement of mine; 'tis the food of
her hours, the &s;ea&s;oning of mine.</P>
<P>Or, in other words, &s;he loves like a
fooli&s;h woman, I like a &s;en&s;ible man:
for men, you know, compared to wo|men,
love in about the proportion of one
to twenty.</P>
<P>'Tis a mighty wrong thing, after all,
Lucy, that parents will educate creatures
<PB N="179" REF="181">
&s;o differently, who are to live with and for
each other.</P>
<P>Every po&s;&s;ible means is u&s;ed, even
from infancy, to &s;often the minds of wo|men,
and to harden tho&s;e of men; the
contrary endeavor might be of u&s;e, for
the men creatures are unfeeling enough
by nature, and we are born too trem|blingly
alive to love, and indeed to every
&s;oft affection.</P>
<P>Your brother is almo&s;t the only one
of his &s;ex I know, who has the tender|ne&s;s
of woman with the &s;pirit and firm|ne&s;s
of man: a circum&s;tance which &s;trikes
every woman who conver&s;es with him,
and which contributes to make him the
favorite he is among&s;t us. Fooli&s;h wo|men
who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h characters
may po&s;&s;ibly give the preference to a
coxcomb; but I will venture to &s;ay,
no woman of &s;en&s;e was ever much ac|quainted
with Colonel Rivers without
<PB N="180" REF="182">
feeling for him an affection of &s;ome
kind or other.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to women, the e&s;timable part
of us are divided into two cla&s;&s;es only,
the tender and the lively.</P>
<P>The former, at the head of which I
place Emily, are infinitely more capable
of happine&s;s; but, to counterbalance
this advantage, they are al&s;o capable of
mi&s;ery in the &s;ame degree. We of the
other cla&s;s, who feel le&s;s keenly, are per|haps
upon the whole as happy, at lea&s;t I
would fain think &s;o.</P>
<P>For example, if Emily and I marry
our pre&s;ent lovers, &s;he will certainly be
more exqui&s;itely happy than I &s;hall; but
if they &s;hould change their minds, or any
accident prevent our coming together, I
am inclined to fancy my &s;ituation would
be much the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">
I &s;hould pout a month, and then look
about for another lover; whil&s;t the ten|der
Emily would</P>
<LG>
<L>&startq;Sit like patience on a monument,&endq;</L>
</LG>
<P>and pine her&s;elf into a con&s;umption.</P>

<DIV2>
<P>Tue&s;day, midnight.</P>
<P>We have had a very agreeable day,
Lucy, a pretty enough kind of a ball,
and every body in good humor: I danced
with Fitzgerald, whom I never knew &s;o
agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184">
Happy love is gay, I find; Emily is all
&s;prightline&s;s, your brother's eyes have
never left her one moment, and her
blu&s;hes &s;eemed to &s;hew her &s;en&s;e of the
di&s;tinction; I never knew her look &s;o
hand&s;ome as this day.</P>
<P>Do you know I felt for Madame
Des Roches? Emily was exce&s;&s;ively
complai&s;ant to her: &s;he returned her
civility, but I could perceive a kind
of con&s;traint in her manner, very dif|ferent
from the ea&s;e of her behaviour
when we &s;aw her before: &s;he felt the
attention of Rivers to Emily very
&s;trongly: in &s;hort, the ladies &s;eem|ed
to have changed characters for the
day.</P>
<P>We &s;upped with your brother on our
return, and from his windows, which
look on the river St. Charles, had the
plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving one of the mo&s;t
beautiful objects imaginable, which I
<PB N="183" REF="185">
never remember to have &s;een before this
evening.</P>
<P>You are to ob&s;erve the winter method
of fi&s;hing here, is to break openings like
&s;mall fi&s;h ponds on the ice, to which the
fi&s;h coming for air, are taken in prodi|gious
quantities on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>To &s;helter them&s;elves from the exce&s;|&s;ive
cold of the night, the fi&s;hermen build
&s;mall hou&s;es of ice on the river, which
are arranged in a &s;emicircular form, and
extend near a quarter of a mile, and
which, from the blazing fires within, have
a brilliant tran&s;parency and vivid lu&s;tre,
not ea&s;y either to imagine or to de&s;cribe:
the &s;tarry &s;emicircle looks like an immen&s;e
cre&s;cent of diamonds, on which the &s;un
darts his meridian rays.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olutely, Lucy, you &s;ee nothing in
Europe: you are cultivated, you have
the tame beauties of art; but to &s;ee na|ture
<PB N="184" REF="186">
in her lovely wild luxuriance, you
mu&s;t vi&s;it your brother when he is prince
of the Kamara&s;kas.</P>

<DIV2>
<P>The variety, as well of grand objects,
as of amu&s;ements, in this country, con|firms
me in an opinion I have always had,
that Providence had made the conveni|ences
and inconveniences of life nearly
equal every where.</P>
<P>We have plea&s;ures here even in winter
peculiar to the climate, which counterbalance
the evils we &s;uffer from its rigor.</P>

<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>April 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment, my dear, a
letter from Montreal, de&s;cribing &s;ome
lands on Lake Champlain, which my
friend thinks much better worth my
taking than tho&s;e near the Kamara&s;kas:
he pre&s;&s;es me to come up immediately
to &s;ee them, as the ice on the rivers
will in a few days be dangerous to tra|vel
on.</P>
<P>I am &s;trongly inclined to go, and for
this rea&s;on; I am convinced my wi&s;h of
bringing about a friend&s;hip between
Emily and Madame Des Roches, the
&s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on I had for fixing at the
<PB N="186" REF="188">
Kamara&s;kas, was an imprudent one: gra|titude
and (if the expre&s;&s;ion is not im|pertinent)
compa&s;&s;ion give me a &s;oftne&s;s
in my behaviour to the latter, which a
&s;uperficial ob&s;erver would take for love,
and which her own tenderne&s;s may cau&s;e
even her to mi&s;con&s;true; a circum&s;tance
which mu&s;t retard her re&s;olution of
changing the affection with which &s;he
has honored me, into friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o delicate in my love, and
cannot bear to have it one moment &s;up|po&s;ed,
my heart can know a wi&s;h but for
my Emily.</P>
<P>Shall I &s;ay more? The blu&s;h on
Emily's cheek on her fir&s;t &s;eeing Madame
Des Roches convinced me of my indi&s;|cretion,
and that vanity alone carried me
to de&s;ire to bring together two women,
who&s;e affection for me is from their ex|treme
merit &s;o very flattering.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189">
I &s;hall certainly now fix in Canada; I
can no longer doubt of Emily's tender|ne&s;s,
tho' &s;he refu&s;es me her hand, from
motives which make her a thou&s;and times
more dear to me, but which I flatter my|&s;elf
love will over-rule.</P>
<P>I am &s;etting off in an hour for Mont|real,
and &s;hall call at Silleri to take
Emily's commands.</P>
<Q>Seven in the evening, Des Chambeaux.</Q>
<P>I a&s;ked her advice as to fixing the place
of my &s;ettlement; &s;he &s;aid much again&s;t
my &s;taying in America at all; but, if I
was determined, recommended Lake
Champlain rather than the Kamara&s;kas,
on account of climate. Bell &s;miled; and
a blu&s;h, which I perfectly under&s;tood,
over&s;pread the lovely cheek of my &s;weet
Emily. Nothing could be more flatter|ing
than this circum&s;tance; had &s;he &s;een
Madame Des Roches with a calm indif|ference,
<PB N="188" REF="190">
had &s;he not been alarmed at the
idea of fixing near her, I &s;hould have
doubted of the degree of her affection; a
little apprehen&s;ion is in&s;eparable from
real love.</P>
<P>My courage has been to-day extremely
put to the proof: had I &s;taid three days
longer, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to
have continued my journey.</P>
<P>The ice cracks under us at every &s;tep
the hor&s;es &s;et, a rather unplea&s;ant circum|&s;tance
on a river twenty fathom deep: I
&s;hould not have attempted the journey
had I been aware of this particular. I
hope no man meets inevitable danger
with more &s;pirit, but no man is le&s;s fond
of &s;eeking it where it is honorably to be
avoided.</P>
<P>I am going to &s;up with the &s;eigneur of
the village, who is, I am told, married
to one of the hand&s;ome&s;t women in the
province.</P>

<OPENER>To Mrs. TEMPLE, Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>April 3.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM arrived, my dear, after a very di&s;|agreeable
and dangerous journey; I
was obliged to leave the river &s;oon after
I left Des Chambeaux, and to pur|&s;ue
my way on the land over melting
&s;now, into which the hor&s;es feet &s;unk half
a yard every &s;tep.</P>
<P>An officer ju&s;t come from New York
has given me a letter from you, which
<PB N="190" REF="192">
came thither by a private &s;hip: I am
happy to hear of your health, and
that Temple's affection for you &s;eems
rather to increa&s;e than le&s;&s;en &s;ince your
marriage.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, my dear Lucy, how to
pre&s;erve this affection, on the continuance
of which, you ju&s;tly &s;ay, your whole hap|pine&s;s
depends.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is perhaps the mo&s;t deli|cate
and important which re&s;pects human
life; the caprice, the incon&s;tancy, the
inju&s;tice of men, makes the $word$ of wo|men
in marriage infinitely difficult.</P>
<P>Prudence and virtue will certainly &s;e|cure
e&s;teem; but unfortunately, e&s;teem
alone will not make a happy marriage;
pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o be kept alive, which the
continual pre&s;ence of the object beloved
is too apt to make &s;ub&s;ide into that apa|thy,
&s;o in&s;upportable to &s;en&s;ible minds.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193">
The higher your rank, and the le&s;s your
manner of life &s;eparates you from each
other, the more danger there will be of
this indifference.</P>
<P>The poor, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ary avocations
divide them all day, and who&s;e &s;en&s;i|bility
is blunted by the coar&s;ene&s;s of
their education, are in no danger of
being weary of each other; and, unle&s;s
naturally vicious, you will &s;ee them ge|nerally
happy in marriage; whereas even
the virtuous, in more affluent &s;ituations,
are not &s;ecure from this unhappy ce&s;&s;a|tion
of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>When I received your letter, I was
reading Madame De Maintenon's advice
to the Duche&s;s of Burgundy, on this
&s;ubject. I will tran&s;cribe &s;o much of
it as relates to <HI>the woman,</HI> leaving her
advice to <HI>the prince&s;s</HI> to tho&s;e whom it may
concern.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194">
&startq;Do not hope for perfect happine&s;s;
there is no &s;uch thing in this &s;ublunary
&s;tate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your &s;ex is the more expo&s;ed to &s;uf|fer,
becau&s;e it is always in depen|dence:
be neither angry nor a&s;hamed
of this dependence on a hu&s;band, nor
of any of tho&s;e which are in the order
of Providence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let your hu&s;band be your be&s;t friend
and your only confidant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not hope that your union will
procure you perfect peace: the be&s;t
marriages are tho&s;e where with &s;oft|ne&s;s
and patience they bear by turns
with each other; there are none
without &s;ome contradiction and di&s;|agreement.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not expect the &s;ame degree of
friend&s;hip that you feel: men are in
<PB N="193" REF="195">
general le&s;s tender than women; and
you will be unhappy if you are too de|licate
in friend&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Beg of God to guard your heart
from jealou&s;y: do not hope to bring
back a hu&s;band by complaints, ill hu|mor,
and reproaches. The only means
which promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, are patience
and &s;oftne&s;s: impatience &s;ours and alie|nates
hearts: &s;oftne&s;s leads them back
to their duty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In &s;acrificing your own will, pretend
to no right over that of a hu&s;band:
men are more attached to theirs than
women, becau&s;e educated with le&s;s
con&s;traint.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They are naturally tyrannical; they
will have plea&s;ures and liberty, yet
in&s;i&s;t that women renounce both: do
not examine whether their rights are
well founded; let it &s;uffice to you,
that they are e&s;tabli&s;hed; they are
<PB N="194" REF="196">
ma&s;ters, we have only to &s;uffer and obey
with a good grace.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus far Madame De Maintenon,
who mu&s;t be allowed to have known
the heart of man, &s;ince, after having
been above twenty years a widow, &s;he
enflamed, even to the degree of bring|ing
him to marry her, that of a great
monarch, younger than her&s;elf, &s;ur|rounded
by Beauties, habituated to flat|tery,
in the plenitude of power, and
covered with glory; and retained him
in her chains to the la&s;t moments of his
life.</P>
<P>Do not, however, my dear, be alarmed
at the picture &s;he has drawn of marriage;
nor fancy with her, that women are only
born to &s;uffer and to obey.</P>
<P>That we are generally tyrannical, I
am obliged to own; but &s;uch of us as
know how to be happy, willingly give
up the har&s;h title of Ma&s;ter, for the more
<PB N="195" REF="197">
tender and endearing one of Friend: Men
of &s;en&s;e abhor tho&s;e cu&s;toms which treat
your &s;ex as if created merely for the
happine&s;s of the other; a &s;uppo&s;ition
injurious to the Deity, though flat|tering
to our tyranny and &s;elf-love; and
wi&s;h only to bind you in the &s;oft chains
of affection.</P>
<P>Equality is the &s;oul of friend&s;hip:
marriage, to give delight, mu&s;t join two
minds, not devote a &s;lave to the will of
an imperious lord; whatever conveys
the idea of &s;ubjection nece&s;&s;arily de|&s;troys
that of love, of which I am &s;o
convinced, that I have always wi&s;hed the
word OBEY expunged from the marriage
ceremony.</P>
<P>If you will permit me to add my &s;enti|ments
to tho&s;e of a lady &s;o learned in the
art of plea&s;ing; I would wi&s;h you to
&s;tudy the ta&s;te of your hu&s;band, and en|deavor
to acquire a reli&s;h for tho&s;e plea|&s;ures
which appear mo&s;t to affect him;
<PB N="196" REF="198">
let him find amu&s;ement at home, but never
be peevi&s;h at his going abroad; he will re|turn
to you with the higher gu&s;t for your
conver&s;ation: have &s;eparate apartments,
&s;ince your fortune makes it not inconve|nient;
be always elegant, but not too ex|pen&s;ive,
in your dre&s;s; retain your pre&s;ent
exqui&s;ite delicacy of every kind; receive
his friends with good-breeding and com|placency;
contrive &s;uch little parties of
plea&s;ure as you know are agreeable to
him, and with the mo&s;t agreeable people
you can &s;elect: be lively even to playful|ne&s;s
in your general turn of conver&s;ation
with him; but, at the &s;ame time, &s;pare
no pains &s;o to improve your under&s;tand|ing,
which is an excellent one, as to be
no le&s;s capable of being the companion
of his graver hours: be ignorant of no|thing
which it becomes your &s;ex to
know, but avoid all affectation of know|ledge:
let your oeconomy be exact, but
without appearing otherwi&s;e than by the
effect.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199">
Do not imitate tho&s;e of your &s;ex who
by ill temper make a hu&s;band pay dear
for their fidelity; let virtue in you be
dre&s;t in &s;miles; and be a&s;&s;ured that
chearfulne&s;s is the native garb of inno|cence.</P>
<P>In one word, my dear, do not lo&s;e the
mi&s;tre&s;s in the wife, but let your beha|viour
to him as a hu&s;band be &s;uch as you
would have thought mo&s;t proper to attract
him as a lover: have always the idea of
plea&s;ing before you, and you cannot fail
to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Having lectured you, my dear Lucy, I
mu&s;t &s;ay a word to Temple: a great va|riety
of rules have been given for the
conduct of women in marriage; &s;carce
any for that of men; as if it was not e&s;|&s;ential
to dome&s;tic happine&s;s, that the
man &s;hould pre&s;erve the heart of her with
whom he is to &s;pend his life; or as if
be&s;towing happine&s;s were not worth a
man's attention, &s;o he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it: if,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
however, it is po&s;&s;ible to feel true happi|ne&s;s
without giving it.</P>
<P>You, my dear Temple, have too ju&s;t
an idea of plea&s;ure to think in this man|ner:
you would be beloved; it has been
the pur&s;uit of your life, though never
really attained perhaps before. You at
pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s a heart full of &s;en&s;ibility,
a heart capable of loving with ardor,
and from the &s;ame cau&s;e as capable
of being e&s;tranged by neglect: give
your whole attention to pre&s;erving this
invaluable trea&s;ure; ob&s;erve every rule
I have given to her, if you would be
happy; and believe me, the heart of wo|man
is not le&s;s delicate than tender;
their &s;en&s;ibility is more keen, they feel
more &s;trongly than we do, their tender|ne&s;s
is more ea&s;ily wounded, and their
hearts are more difficult to recover if
once lo&s;t.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, they are both
by nature and education more con&s;tant,
<PB N="199" REF="201">
and &s;carce ever change the object of their
affections but from ill treatment: for
which rea&s;on there is &s;ome excu&s;e for a
cu&s;tom which appears cruel, that of
throwing contempt on the hu&s;band for
the ill conduct of the wife.</P>
<P>Above all things, retain the politene&s;s
and attention of a lover; and avoid that
carele&s;s manner which wounds the va|nity
of human nature, a pa&s;&s;ion given
us, as were all pa&s;&s;ions, for the wi&s;e&s;t
ends, and which never quits us but with
life.</P>
<P>There is a certain attentive tender|ne&s;s,
difficult to be de&s;cribed, which
the manly of our &s;ex feel, and which
is peculiarly plea&s;ing to woman: 'tis
al&s;o a very delightful &s;en&s;ation to our|&s;elves,
as well as productive of the
happie&s;t con&s;equences: regarding them
as creatures placed by Providence un|der
our protection, and depending on
<PB N="200" REF="202">
us for their happine&s;s, is the &s;tronge&s;t
po&s;&s;ible tie of affection to a well-turned
mind.</P>
<P>If I did not know Lucy perfectly,
I &s;hould perhaps he&s;itate in the next
advice I am going to give you; which
is, to make her the confidante, and the
<HI>only</HI> confidante, of your gallantries, if
you are &s;o unhappy as to be inadver|tently
betrayed into any: her heart will
po&s;&s;ibly be at fir&s;t a little wounded
by the confe&s;&s;ion, but this proof of
perfect e&s;teem will increa&s;e her friend|&s;hip
for you; &s;he will regard your
error with compa&s;&s;ion and indulgence,
and lead you gently back by her
endearing tenderne&s;s to honor and her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Of all ta&s;ks I dete&s;t that of giving ad|vice:
you are therefore under infinite
obligation to me for this letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Earl of &mdash;.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be more true, my
Lord, than that poverty is ever the
in&s;eparable companion of indolence.</P>
<P>I &s;ee proofs of it every moment before
me; with a &s;oil fruitful beyond all be|lief,
the Canadians are poor on lands
which are their own property, and for
<PB N="202" REF="204">
which they pay only a trifling quit-rent
to their &s;eigneurs.</P>
<P>This indolence appears in every thing:
you &s;carce &s;ee the meane&s;t pea&s;ant walk|ing;
even riding on hor&s;eback appears
to them a fatigue in&s;upportable; you
&s;ee them lolling at ea&s;e, like their lazy
lords, in carrioles and cala&s;hes, according
to the &s;ea&s;on; a boy to guide the hor&s;e
on a &s;eat in the front of the carriage,
too lazy even to take the trouble of driv|ing
them&s;elves, their hands in winter
folded in an immen&s;e muff, though per|haps
their families are in want of bread
to eat at home.</P>
<P>The winter is pa&s;&s;ed in a mixture of
fe&s;tivity and inaction; dancing and fea&s;t|ing
in their gayer hours; in their graver
&s;moking, and drinking brandy, by the
&s;ide of a warm &s;tove: and when obliged
to cultivate the ground in &s;pring to pro|cure
the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, you &s;ee
them ju&s;t turn the turf once lightly over,
<PB N="203" REF="205">
and, without manuring the ground, or
even breaking the clods of earth, throw
in the &s;eed in the &s;ame carele&s;s manner,
and leave the event to chance, without
troubling them&s;elves further till it is fit to
reap.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, as &s;ome al|leviation,
that there is &s;omething in the
climate which &s;trongly inclines both the
body and mind, but rather the latter, to
indolence: the heat of the &s;ummer,
though plea&s;ing, enervates the very &s;oul,
and gives a certain la&s;&s;itude unfavorable
to indu&s;try; and the winter, at its ex|treme,
binds up and chills all the active
faculties of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the general &s;pirit of
amu&s;ement, &s;o univer&s;al here in winter,
and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the ill effects
of the &s;ea&s;on, gives a habit of di&s;&s;ipation
and plea&s;ure, which makes labor doubly
irk&s;ome at its return.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">
Their religion, to which they are ex|tremely
bigoted, is another great bar, as
well to indu&s;try as population: their nu|merous
fe&s;tivals inure them to idlene&s;s;
their religious hou&s;es rob the &s;tate of
many &s;ubjects who might be highly u&s;e|ful
at pre&s;ent, and at the &s;ame time retard
the increa&s;e of the colony.</P>
<P>Sloth and &s;uper&s;tition equally counter-work
providence, and render the bounty
of Heaven of no effect.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized the French, who gene|rally
make their religion &s;ub&s;ervient to
the purpo&s;es of policy, do not di&s;cou|rage
convents, and le&s;&s;en the number of
fe&s;tivals, in the colonies, where both are
&s;o peculiarly pernicious.</P>
<P>It is to this circum&s;tance one may in
great mea&s;ure attribute the &s;uperior in|crea&s;e
of the Briti&s;h American &s;ettlements
compared to tho&s;e of France: a religion
which encourages idlene&s;s, and makes
<PB N="205" REF="207">
a virtue of celibacy, is particularly unfa|vorable
to colonization.</P>
<P>However religious prejudice may have
been &s;uffered to counterwork policy under
a French government, it is &s;carce to be
doubted that this cau&s;e of the poverty of
Canada will by degrees be removed; that
the&s;e people, &s;laves at pre&s;ent to igno|rance
and &s;uper&s;tition, will in time be
enlightened by a more liberal education,
and gently led by rea&s;on to a religion
which is not only preferable, as being that
of the country to which they are now
annexed, but which is &s;o much more
calculated to make them happy and
pro&s;perous as a people.</P>
<P>Till that time, till their prejudices &s;ub|&s;ide,
it is equally ju&s;t, humane, and wi&s;e,
to leave them the free right of wor&s;hip|ing
the Deity in the manner which they
have been early taught to believe the be&s;t,
and to which they are con&s;equently at|tached.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208">
It would be unju&s;t to deprive them of
any of the rights of citizens on account
of religion, in America, where every
other &s;ect of di&s;&s;enters are equally capable
of employ with tho&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
church; nay where, from whatever cau&s;e,
the church of England is on a footing in
many colonies little better than a tole|ration.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly, in a political light, an
object of con&s;equence every where, that
the national religion, whatever it is, &s;hould
be as univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible, agreement in
religious wor&s;hip being the &s;tronge&s;t tie
to unity and obedience: had all prudent
means been u&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the number of
di&s;&s;enters in our colonies, I cannot avoid
believing, from what I ob&s;erve and hear,
that we &s;hould have &s;ound in them a &s;pirit
of rational loyalty, and true freedom, in|&s;tead
of that factious one from which &s;o
much is to be apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209">
It &s;eems con&s;onant to rea&s;on, that the
religion of every country &s;hould have a
relation to, and coherence with, the civil
con&s;titution: the Romi&s;h religion is be&s;t
adapted to a de&s;potic government, the
pre&s;byterian to a republican, and that of
the church of England to a limited mo|narchy
like ours.</P>
<P>As therefore the civil government of
America is on the &s;ame plan with that of
the mother country, it were to be wi&s;hed
the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment was al&s;o the
&s;ame, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e colonies where
the people are generally of the national
church; though with the fulle&s;t liberty of
con&s;cience to di&s;&s;enters of all denomina|tions.</P>
<P>I would be clearly under&s;tood, my
Lord; from all I have ob&s;erved here, I
am convinced, nothing would &s;o much
contribute to diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of order, and
rational obedience, in the colonies, as the
appointment, under proper re&s;trictions, of
<PB N="208" REF="210">
bi&s;hops: I am equally convinced that
nothing would &s;o much &s;trengthen the
hands of government, or give &s;uch plea|&s;ure
to the well-affected in the colonies,
who are by much the mo&s;t numerous, as
&s;uch an appointment, however clamored
again&s;t by a few abettors of &s;edition.</P>
<P>I am called upon for this letter, and
mu&s;t remit to another time what I wi&s;hed
to &s;ay more to your Lord&s;hip in regard to
this country.</P>

<P>I AM indeed, Madam, this incon&s;i&s;tent
creature. I have at once refu&s;ed to
marry Colonel Rivers, and owned to him
all the tenderne&s;s of my &s;oul.</P>

&s;uppo&s;e my refu&s;al the effect of an un|meaning
childi&s;h affectation of di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s:
I can form to my&s;elf no idea of
happine&s;s equal to that of &s;pending my
life with Rivers, the be&s;t, the mo&s;t ten|der,
the mo&s;t amiable of mankind; nor
can I &s;upport the idea of his marrying
any other woman: I would therefore
marry him to-morrow were it po&s;&s;ible
without ruining him, without dooming
<PB N="210" REF="212">
him to a perpetual exile, and ob&s;tructing
tho&s;e views of hone&s;t ambition at home,
which become his birth, his connexions,
his talents, his time of life; and with
which, as his friend, it is my duty to
in&s;pire him.</P>
<P>His affection for me at pre&s;ent blinds
him, he &s;ees no object but me in the whole
univer&s;e; but &s;hall I take advantage of
that inebriation of tenderne&s;s, to &s;educe
him into a mea&s;ure incon&s;i&s;tent with his
real happine&s;s and intere&s;t? He mu&s;t re|turn
to England, mu&s;t pur&s;ue fortune in
that world for which he was formed: &s;hall
his Emily retard him in the glorious race?
&s;hall &s;he not rather encourage him in
every laudable attempt? &s;hall &s;he &s;uffer
him to hide that &s;hining merit in the un|cultivated
wilds of Canada, the &s;eat of
barbari&s;m and ignorance, which entitles
him to hope a happy fate in the dear land
of arts and arms?</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213">
I entreat you to do all you can to di&s;|courage
his de&s;ign. Remind him that
his &s;i&s;ter's marriage has in &s;ome degree
removed the cau&s;e of his coming hither;
that he can have now no motive for
fixing here, but his tenderne&s;s for me;
that I &s;hall be ju&s;tly blamed by all who
love him for keeping him here. Tell
him, I will not marry him in Canada;
that his &s;tay makes the be&s;t-mother in the
world wretched; that he owes his return
to him&s;elf, nay to his Emily, who&s;e
whole heart is &s;et on &s;eeing him in a
&s;ituation worthy of him: though without
ambition as to my&s;elf, I am proud, I am
ambitious for him; if he loves me, he
will gratify that pride, that ambition;
and leave Canada to tho&s;e who&s;e duty
confines them here, or who&s;e intere&s;t
it is to remain un&s;een. Let him not
once think of me in his determination:
I am content to be beloved, and will

<P>Not, my dear, that I have the weakne&s;s

&s;he is very amiable, and certainly de&s;erves

<P>HOW unju&s;t have I been in my hatred
of Madame Des Roches! &s;he &s;pent
ye&s;terday with us, and after dinner de&s;ired
to conver&s;e with me an hour in my apart|ment,
where &s;he opened to me all her
heart on the &s;ubject of her love for
Rivers.</P>
<P>She is the noble&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of
women, and I have been in regard to her
the mo&s;t capricious and unju&s;t: my hatred
of her was unworthy my character; I
blu&s;h to own the meanne&s;s of my &s;enti|ments,
whil&s;t I admire the genero&s;ity of
hers.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223">
Why, my dear, &s;hould I have hated
her? &s;he was unhappy, and de&s;erved
rather my compa&s;&s;ion: I had deprived
her of all hope of being beloved, it was
too much to wi&s;h to deprive her al&s;o of
his conver&s;ation. I knew my&s;elf the
only object of Rivers's love; why then
&s;hould I have envied her his friend|&s;hip?
&s;he had the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to hate
me, but I &s;hould have loved and pitied
her.</P>
<P>Can there be a misfortune equal to
that of loving Rivers without hope of
a return? Yet &s;he has not only borne
this misfortune without complaint, but
has been the confidante of his pa&s;&s;ion for
another; he owned to her all his ten|derne&s;s
for me, and drew a picture of
me, &startq;which, &s;he told me, ought, had
&s;he li&s;tened to rea&s;on, to have de&s;troyed
even the &s;hadow of hope: but that love,
ever ready to flatter and deceive, had
betrayed her into the weakne&s;s of &s;up|po&s;ing
it po&s;&s;ible I might refu&s;e him,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
and that gratitude might, in that ca&s;e,
touch his heart with tenderne&s;s for one
who loved him with the mo&s;t pure and
di&s;intere&s;ted affection; that her journey
to Quebec had removed the veil love
had placed between her and truth; that
&s;he was now convinced the &s;aint hope
&s;he had encouraged was madne&s;s, and
that our &s;ouls were formed for each
other.</P>
<P>She owned &s;he &s;till loved him with
the mo&s;t lively affection; yet a&s;&s;ured me,
&s;ince &s;he was not allowed to make the
mo&s;t amiable of mankind happy her|&s;elf,
&s;he wi&s;hed him to be &s;o with the

<P>She added, that &s;he had on fir&s;t &s;eeing

unworthy a &s;entiment; that Rivers's

complai&s;ance had a little di&s;&s;ipated her
chagrin, and enabled her to behave to me
in the manner &s;he did: that &s;he had,
however, almo&s;t hated me at the ball in
the country: that the tenderne&s;s in Ri|vers's
eyes that day whenever they met
mine, and his comparative inartention to
her, had wounded her to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>That this preference had, however,
been &s;alutary, though painful; &s;ince it
had determined her to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion,
which could only make her life wretched
if it continued; that, as the fir&s;t &s;tep
to this conque&s;t, &s;he had re&s;olved to &s;ee
him no more: that &s;he would return to
her hou&s;e the moment &s;he could cro&s;s
the river with &s;afety; and conjured me,
for her &s;ake, to per&s;uade him to give up
all thoughts of a &s;ettlement near her;
that &s;he could not an&s;wer for her own
heart if &s;he continued to &s;ee him; that
&s;he believed in love there was no &s;afety
but in &s;light.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226">
That his ab&s;ence had given her time to
think coolly; and that &s;he now &s;aw &s;o
&s;trongly the amiablene&s;s of my character,
and was &s;o convinced of my perfect ten|derne&s;s
for him, that &s;he &s;hould hate
her&s;elf were &s;he capable of wi&s;hing to in|terrupt
our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>That &s;he hoped I would pardon her re|taining
a tender remembrance of a man
who, had he never &s;een me, might have
returned her affection; that &s;he thought
&s;o highly of my heart, as to believe I
could not hate a woman who e&s;teemed
me, and who &s;olicited my friend&s;hip,
though a happy rival.&endq;</P>
<P>I was touched, even to tears, at her
behaviour: we embraced; and, if I
know my own weak fooli&s;h heart, I love
her.</P>
<P>She talks of leaving Quebec before
Rivers's return; &s;he &s;aid, her coming
was an imprudence which only love
<PB N="225" REF="227">
could excu&s;e; and that &s;he had no mo|tive
for her journey but the de&s;ire of
&s;eeing him, which was &s;o lively as to
hurry her into an indi&s;cretion of which
&s;he was afraid the world took but too
much notice. What openne&s;s, what &s;in|cerity,
what genero&s;ity, was there in all
&s;he &s;aid!</P>
<P>How &s;uperior, my dear, is her cha|racter
to mine! I blu&s;h for my&s;elf on the
compari&s;on; I am &s;hocked to &s;ee how
much &s;he &s;oars above me: how is it
po&s;&s;ible Rivers &s;hould not have pre|ferred
her to me? Yet this is the wo|man
I fancied incapable of any pa&s;&s;ion
but vanity.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, my dear Bell, I am not na|turally
envious of the merit of others;
but my exce&s;s of love for Rivers makes
me apprehen&s;ive of every woman who
can po&s;&s;ibly rival me in his tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228">
I was hurt at Madame Des Roches's
uncommon merit; I &s;aw with pain the
amiable qualities of her mind; I could
&s;carce even allow her per&s;on to be plea&s;|ing:
but this inju&s;tice is not that of my
natural temper, but of love.</P>
<P>She is certainly right, my dear, to &s;ee
him no more; I applaud, I admire her
re&s;olution: do you think, however, &s;he
would pur&s;ue it if &s;he loved as I do? &s;he
has perhaps loved before, and her heart
has lo&s;t &s;omething of its native trembling
&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h my heart felt her merit as
&s;trongly as my rea&s;on: I e&s;teem, I ad|mire,
I even love her at pre&s;ent; but I
am convinced Rivers's return while &s;he
continues here would weaken the&s;e &s;enti|ments
of affection: the lea&s;t appearance
of preference, even for a moment, would
make me relap&s;e into my former weak|ne&s;s.
I adore, I idolize her character; but
<PB N="227" REF="229">
I cannot &s;incerely wi&s;h to cultivate her
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee you this afternoon at Que|bec;
I am told the roads will not be
pa&s;&s;able for carrioles above three days
longer: let me therefore &s;ee you as often
as I can before we are ab&s;olutely &s;hut

<HEAD>LETTER CXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Earl of&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ENGLAND, however populous, is
undoubtedly, my Lord, too &s;mall to
afford very large &s;upplies of people to
her colonies: and her people are al&s;o too
u&s;eful, and of too much value, to be
&s;uffered to emigrate, if they can be pre|vented,
whil&s;t there is &s;ufficient employ|ment
for them at home.</P>
<P>It is not only our intere&s;t to have colo|nies;
they are not only nece&s;&s;ary to our
commerce, and our greate&s;t and &s;ure&s;t
&s;ources of wealth, but our very being as
a powerful commercial nation depends
on them: it is therefore an object of all
others mo&s;t worthy our attention, that
<PB N="229" REF="231">
they &s;hould be as flouri&s;hing and popu|lous
as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is however equally our intere&s;t to
&s;upport them at as little expence of our
own inhabitants as po&s;&s;ible: I therefore
look on the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch a number
of &s;ubjects as we found in Canada, to be a
much &s;uperior advantage to that of gain|ing
ten times the immen&s;e tract of land
ceded to us, if uncultivated and de&s;titute
of inhabitants.</P>
<P>But it is not only contrary to our in|tere&s;t
to &s;pare many of our own people
as &s;ettlers in America; it mu&s;t al&s;o be
con&s;idered, that, if we could &s;pare them,
the Engli&s;h are the wor&s;t &s;ettlers on new
lands in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Their attachment to their native coun|try,
e&s;pecially among&s;t the lower ranks
of people, is &s;o very &s;trong, that few of
<PB N="230" REF="232">
the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious can be pre|vailed
on to leave it; tho&s;e therefore who
go, are generally the di&s;&s;olute and the
idle, who are of no u&s;e any where.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h are al&s;o, though indu&s;tri|ous,
active, and enterprizing, ill fitted
to bear the hard&s;hips, and &s;ubmit to
the wants, which inevitably attend an
infant &s;ettlement even on the mo&s;t fruit|ful
lands.</P>
<P>The Germans, on the contrary, with the
&s;ame u&s;eful qualities, have a patience, a
per&s;everance, an ab&s;tinence, which peculi|arly
fit them for the cultivation of new
countries; too great encouragement there|fore
cannot be given to them to &s;ettle in
our colonies: they make better &s;ettlers
than our own people; and at the &s;ame time
their numbers are an acqui&s;ition of real
&s;trength where they fix, without weaken|ing
the mother country.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233">
It is long &s;ince the populou&s;ne&s;s of
Europe has been the cau&s;e of her &s;ending
out colonies: a better policy prevails;
mankind are enlightened; we are now
convinced, both by rea&s;on and experience,
that no indu&s;trious people can be too po|pulous.</P>
<P>The northern &s;warms were compelled
to leave their re&s;pective countries, not
becau&s;e tho&s;e countries were unable to
&s;upport them, but becau&s;e they were too
idle to cultivate the ground: they were
a ferocious, ignorant, barbarous people,
aver&s;e to labor, attached to war, and,
like our American &s;avages, believing
every employment not relative to this
favorite object, beneath the dignity of
man.</P>
<P>Their emigrations therefore were le&s;s
owing to their populou&s;ne&s;s, than to their
want of indu&s;try, and barbarous contempt
of agriculture and every u&s;eful art.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="234">
It is with pain I am compelled to &s;ay,
the late &s;pirit of encouraging the mono|poly
of farms, which, from a narrow
&s;hort-&s;ighted policy, prevails among&s;t our
landed men at home, and the alarming
growth of celibacy among&s;t the pea&s;antry,
which is its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, to &s;ay
nothing of the &s;ame ruinous increa&s;e of
celibacy in higher ranks, threaten us with
&s;uch a decrea&s;e of population, as will
probably equal that cau&s;ed by the rava|ges
of tho&s;e &s;courges of Heaven, the &s;word,
the famine, and the pe&s;tilence.</P>
<P>If this &s;elfi&s;h policy continues to extend
it&s;elf, we &s;hall in a few years be &s;o far from
being able to &s;end emigrants to America,
that we &s;hall be reduced to &s;olicit their
return, and that of their po&s;terity, to pre|vent
England's becoming in its turn an
uncultivated de&s;art.</P>
<P>But to return to Canada; this large ac|qui&s;ition
of people is an invaluable trea|&s;ure,
<PB N="233" REF="235">
if managed, as I doubt not it will
be, to the be&s;t advantage; if they are
won by the gentle arts of per&s;ua&s;ion, and
the gradual progre&s;s of knowledge, to
adopt &s;o much of our manners as tends
to make them happier in them&s;elves, and
more u&s;eful members of the &s;ociety to
which they belong: if with our language,
which they &s;hould by every means be in|duced
to learn, they acquire the mild ge|nius
of our religion and laws, and that
&s;pirit of indu&s;try, enterprize, and com|merce,
to which we owe all our greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the various cau&s;es which con|cur
to render France more populous than
England, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantage
of a le&s;s gentle government, and a religion
&s;o very unfavorable to the increa&s;e of man|kind,
the cultivation of vineyards may be
reckoned a principal one; as it employs
a much greater number of hands than
even agriculture it&s;elf, which has how|ever
infinite advantages in this re&s;pect
above pa&s;turage, the certain cau&s;e of a
<PB N="234" REF="236">
want of people wherever it prevails above
its due proportion.</P>
<P>Our climate denies us the advantages
ari&s;ing from the culture of vines, as well
as many others which nature has accorded
to France; a con&s;ideration which &s;hould
awaken us from the lethargy into which
the avarice of individuals has plunged us,
and &s;et us in earne&s;t on improving every
advantage we enjoy, in order to &s;ecure us
by our native &s;trength from &s;o formidable
a rival.</P>
<P>The want of bread to eat, from the late
fal&s;e and cruel policy of laying &s;mall farms
into great ones, and the general di&s;cou|ragement
of tillage which is its con&s;e|quence,
is in my opinion much le&s;s to be
apprehended than the want of people to
eat it.</P>
<P>In every country where the inhabitants
are at once numerous and indu&s;trious,
<PB N="235" REF="237">
there will always be a proportionable cul|tivation.</P>
<P>This evil is &s;o very de&s;tructive and a|larming,
that, if the great have not virtue
enough to remedy it, it is to be hoped it
will in time, like mo&s;t great evils, cure
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip enquires into the nature
of this climate in re&s;pect to health. The air
being uncommonly pure and &s;erene, it is
favorable to life beyond any I ever knew:
the people live generally to a very ad|vanced
age; and are remarkably free from
di&s;ea&s;es of every kind, except con&s;ump|tions,
to which the younger part of the in|habitants
are a good deal &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is however a circum&s;tance one cannot
help ob&s;erving, that they begin to look old
much &s;ooner than the people in Europe;
on which my daughter ob&s;erves, that it is
not very plea&s;ant for women to come to
<PB N="236" REF="238">
re&s;ide in a country where people have a
&s;hort youth, and a long old age.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es of cold countries are in
general owing to want of per&s;piration; for
which rea&s;on exerci&s;e, and even di&s;&s;ipation,
are here the be&s;t medicines.</P>
<P>The Indians therefore &s;hewed their
good &s;en&s;e in advi&s;ing the French, on their
fir&s;t arrival, to u&s;e dancing, mirth, chear|fulne&s;s,
and content, as the be&s;t remedies
again&s;t the inconveniences of the climate.</P>
<P>I have already &s;welled this letter to &s;uch
a length, that I mu&s;t po&s;tpone to another
time my account of the peculiar natural
productions of Canada; only ob&s;erving,
that one would imagine Heaven intended a
&s;ocial intercour&s;e between the mo&s;t di&s;tant
nations, by giving them productions of the
earth &s;o very different each from the other,
and each more than &s;ufficient for it&s;elf,
that the exchange might be the means of
<PB N="237" REF="239">
&s;preading the bond of &s;ociety and brother|hood
over the whole globe.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the man who conveys,
and cau&s;es to grow, in any country, a
grain, a fruit, or even a flower, it never
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before, de&s;erves more prai&s;e than
a thou&s;and heroes: he is a benefactor, he
is in &s;ome degree a creator.</P>
