<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE WHIGS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the Mat|ter Intended, I mu&s;t, to avoid Cavils, determine who it is I &s;peak to, that Men may not &s;hift it from one to another, or from one Party to another, and &s;ay, he does not &s;peak to me, or he does not &s;peak to us, and the like.</P>
<P>This Letter is directed to, and de&s;ign'd for the Admonition of tho&s;e we call <HI>Hot Whigs,</HI> and tho&s;e only; Tho&s;e Whigs, who being violently Embark'd in the pre&s;ent Party Heats, between New and Old Mini&s;try, carry on the Breach to that Irreconcilable Dreadful Height which we now &s;ee it is brought to: Of the&s;e, I doubt, this is too true a
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Character, That Reproaching the pre|&s;ent Per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the Admini|&s;tration, with innumerable Errors of Con|duct, they &s;eem rather to oppo&s;e what is doing, becau&s;e of the In&s;truments Act|ing it, than becau&s;e of the Illegality of the Actions; and rather to de&s;ire the Ruin of the Mini&s;ters of State, than their Re|formation; the Motto of the&s;e Mens Banner, again&s;t the Mini&s;try, appealing to their own Con&s;ciences, and taken from their own Mouths, is this, <HI>YO&V; HANG'D, OR WE &V;NDONE.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Mournful Reflection to make in a Chri&s;tian Nation, that &s;uch a Temper &s;hould be found among us; and this gives me Hope, that &s;omething may be offer'd to you Gentlemen, before you plunge your &s;elves into an Inextricable La|byrinth; to prevail with you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, what it is you are doing, and to what I&s;&s;ue &s;uch Actions as the&s;e mu&s;t come: If a calm di&s;intere&s;ted Expo&s;tu|lation may have any Effect, you will, hereafter, Ble&s;s the Agent of &s;o needful a Pacification; if not, you &s;hall not run Headlong into your De&s;truction, and the Ruin of your Country, without a Friendly Admonition; nor &s;hall you be able to &s;ay, you have not been warn'd of the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4" MS="Y">
It is true, things are come to a terrible extremity among us; the Feud of Parties is grown up to &s;uch a height, as &s;eems too great for any Mediation; the Rage is &s;o high, a Parly cannot be expected; no|thing &s;eems to be before us, but Drawing the Sword, and Throwing away the Scabbard; and we expect all the Con|&s;equences of Parties, enflam'd by their own Pa&s;&s;ions to &s;uch a Degree that Wa|ter will not quench it; and People &s;eem to Thir&s;t after &s;omething, which ought not to be Nam'd among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, is a Dange|rous Conjuncture, to attempt the Office of a Moderator in, and he that &s;hall offer to throw Water upon the&s;e Flames, runs a greater Hazard, than he that Embarks in the Quarrel with you can do; tho' I mu&s;t own, I look upon that al&s;o, to be tenfold more Ri&s;que, than his that Embarks again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Some Learned Men endeavouring to give a rational Account of the &s;trange Eruptions of Fire in the Mountains of <HI>Aetna, Ve&s;uvius, Heckela,</HI> and other Volcano's, which have been &s;o Terrible and Dreadful as no Tongue can expre&s;s, have found this to be the be&s;t way to &s;olve the Difficulty of it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That
<PB N="6" REF="5">
there being a prodigious quantity of Sulphurous Matter in the Body of the Earth, which, by natural Agitations, have been many Ages ago &s;et on Fire, &s;preading to an extraordinary Extent of Ground, by its force con&s;uming the Earth, and that Earth again falling in as the parts &s;upporting it are Con&s;um'd, meets at length with &s;ome Subterraneous Waters, who&s;e Current the Earth that pre&s;crib'd it like Banks, being fallen away, turns, and at once pours it &s;elf into the horrible Gulph of Fire; where the Rarification being &s;udden and un|&s;peakably violent, vents it &s;elf through the Cavities and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Mount|ains into the Air, ca&s;ting up Streams of Liquid Fire, va&s;t Stones, Clouds of A&s;hes and Smoak, to the Terrour of the World, as may be de&s;crib'd by throwing Water ha&s;tily into the Mouth of a Fur|nace, when the Fire being Fierce it &s;hall bur&s;t out in your Face, A&s;hes, Smoak, and Coals coming out together, with Ten times more violence than the Water went in with.</P>
<P>You will pardon the Digre&s;&s;ion of this Allu&s;ion, becau&s;e I profe&s;s to expect from the violence of the enflam'd Spirits who I am &s;peaking to, &s;ome Eruption of
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="Y">
their Pa&s;&s;ions, while I endeavour to pour Water into this Fire.</P>
<P>But who knows the Power of calm Rea&s;oning and patient cool Expo&s;tulation? What tho' you are not in &s;peaking Terms with the Mini&s;try, and tho' the more Water they pour in upon your Temper, the more violent Eruptions of your Pa&s;&s;ions are to be expected, &s;o that no|thing is to be hoped for from you on that Side, but Battle and no Quarter; yet who knows but you may allay and tem|per your &s;elves a few Moments, at the &s;incere Motion of tho&s;e, who would fain reconcile you to your &s;elves, and that you may be mov'd to li&s;ten to a Word of per&s;wa&s;ion from a Friend?</P>
<P>I e&s;teem tho&s;e People among your mo&s;t dangerous Enemies, who either prompt you to think your Power greater than it is, or who, if your Power were as Su|perior as they &s;uppo&s;e it, and would have you believe it to be, prompt you to Ex|erci&s;e it in that Cruel and Mercile&s;s man|ner upon your Country-men and Fellow Chri&s;tians, as their Di&s;cour&s;e is every Day full of. This, I think, is Impo|litick to your &s;elves, BECAUSE there being no &s;uch vi&s;ible Appearance of your Succe&s;s, as they Flatter you to
<PB N="8" REF="7">
believe; you thereby &s;eem to Chalk out what you ought to expect in the Treatment you are to receive from your Adver&s;aries, by the Treatment you threaten them with, in Ca&s;e they come into your Power. If <HI>Haman</HI> had &s;een the lea&s;t room to &s;u&s;pect the mi&s;carriage of his Bloody De&s;ign again&s;t the Jews, he would never have made &s;uch a Decla|ration of his re&s;olved Execution again&s;t <HI>Mordecai,</HI> as &s;etting up a Gibbet Fifty Cubits high; it being the mo&s;t Natural thing in the World to him, to have ex|pected the Fate he met with; as being pointed out by his own Finger, and he &s;eem'd to Summon the Ju&s;tice of his Adver&s;aries, to &s;uch a Retaliation, by his own Pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>While then, any Men among you de|clare for Blood, and for &s;hewing no Mercy, tho', even at the &s;ame time, if I may judge Impartially for you, there appears no rational view of obtaining tho&s;e Ends; Do they not Legitimate the utmo&s;t Severity which your Enemies can return upon you, as a ju&s;t Retaliation of your own Mea&s;ures?</P>
<P>This Introductory Caution, I do but mention now, de&s;igning to &s;peak more
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="Y">
largely to it hereafter, while from a &s;in|cere de&s;ire to moderate your Pa&s;&s;ions, and prevent your Inevitable Suppre&s;&s;ion, I de&s;ire to Expo&s;tulate of a few things in your pre&s;ent Conduct, that, if po&s;&s;ible, you may be brought to &s;ee your Mi&s;takes, and avoid the Con&s;equences which mu&s;t be to your Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>In order to Argue clo&s;ely with you, as be&s;t &s;uits the Nature of an Expo&s;tula|tion, I mu&s;t fir&s;t lay down &s;ome things, which Wi&s;e and Impartial Men blame you for, and which I &s;hall give the com|mon Evidences of, by which, they prove that Blame to be ju&s;t; not that I am bringing any Charge again&s;t you, I Accu&s;e you not, there is one that Accu&s;es or Excu&s;es you, even Con&s;cience, to whom you ought to appeal.</P>
<P>$aving laid down, as I &s;ay, the Facts, I &s;hall Argue on the Suppo&s;ition of their being True; and &s;hall then Expo&s;tulate with you freely, upon the Grand Que&s;ti|ons, which you ought &s;incerely to ask your &s;elves, <HI>(viz)</HI> What are we doing? To what Extremities are we running? What will be the Con&s;equences to us, to our Country, to our Po&s;terity, to our Religion and to our Liberties, if we go on?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
The Things which, as above, Think|ing and Con&s;idering Men blame you for, are &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. That your Complaints of Grie|vances, are manag'd in an Unju&s;tifiable and Unchri&s;tian manner.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Heats upon the&s;e Com|plaints, are carried on to an Uuju&s;tifi|able Extreme.</P>
<P N="3">3. And to the&s;e, I mu&s;t add a Third, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That if the fir&s;t are True, then you put your Selves, your Country, and your Po&s;terity, in an Imprudent and Unju&s;tifiable Hazard, by the&s;e Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Explanation and Evidence of Fact, in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, &s;hall run thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the&s;e Sheets, rather than be &s;poken of apart; becau&s;e, tho' I de&s;ire to &s;peak Convincingly and Clearly in them all, yet the Nature of them all &s;o evidently lying in every one and the &s;ame Action, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat them &s;o often, that while any part is left to &s;peak of, no part can be di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The Foundations of our pre&s;ent Heats, they &s;ay, are reduc'd to Two &s;hort Heads, <HI>(viz.)</HI> 1. The Queen's di&s;mi&s;&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="10" MS="Y">
the Late Mini&s;try, and (2.) Admini&s;tring Her Affairs by the Pre&s;ent. The Power the Queen has to change her Servants, they alleage, admits no Di&s;pute; that it has been &s;poken of largely, and no real ju&s;ti|fiable Grievance can be founded on that part.</P>
<P>Neither was it a Sin, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> again&s;t the Con&s;titution in the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, to come in, or accept of the Honour done them by the Queen, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of En|tru&s;ting them with the Admini&s;tration; nay, litterally &s;peaking, and &s;peaking the Court Language, it is very ju&s;tifi|able in them to endeavour by a Legal Admi&s;&s;ion, to be put into the Mini&s;try; if not, the People who &s;eek it now, Incur the &s;ame Charge with much greater di&s;advantage; becau&s;e tho&s;e endeavour'd to per&s;wade her Maje&s;ty to the Change &s;he did make, and the&s;e endeavour to Force her to the Change they would have her make, by plunging her Affairs in &s;uch a manner, as to make it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to do &s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this Charge, is, That of the Scandalous Treatment of Supe|riours. How the Parties have Acted ever &s;ince the beginning of this Change, has been the Subject of &s;o many Debates,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;uch Hot and Reproachful Pamphlets and Libels on both Sides, that with Grief I mention it, have been the Shame of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation; &s;o little Temper, &s;o little Mode&s;ty, &s;uch Per&s;onal Reflecti|ons, &s;uch Slander, &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, as I believe, I may &s;ay, has never been &s;een Acted among Chri&s;tians, or among Gen|tlemen, &s;ince the Name of Chri&s;tian or Gentleman, has been known in the World.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t True, That both Sides have been exceeding Guilty in this part, and the Scandal, the Dirt, the Reproach ca&s;t upon Men of Honour by Name, has been mo&s;t un&s;ufferable on both Sides; I ju&s;tify neither, but is it not &s;urprizing to &s;ee the <HI>Whigs,</HI> who&s;e pretences to Moderation and Chri&s;tianity have run high, who in former Times, were wont to carry a good Cau&s;e by ju&s;t Mea&s;ures, and who in their Prints, complain &s;o loudly of the <HI>Examiner,</HI> for his Treat|ment of the Duke of <HI>M&mdash;gh,</HI> fall in the $ouleit manner po&s;&s;ible, into the &s;ame Error. I am not ju&s;tifying the <HI>Examiner</HI> in his Treatment of the Duke of <HI>M&mdash;gh,</HI> nor any other Fomen|ters of Scandal on that Side, I equally abhor the Method: But let me &s;peak to
<PB N="13" REF="12" MS="Y">
you, who I call Hone&s;t Men, in the Language of hone&s;t Men, look into your own &s;ecret Party Conver&s;ation, as well as public Coffee-hou&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e and Printed Pamphlets, and let me appeal to your own Con&s;ciences; Is not this part of the Charge too home upon you? Has any thing, that ever the oppo&s;ite Party either Said or Printed&punc; upon the whole Body of the Late Mini&s;try, come up to the Language you give the Pre&s;ent Mi|ni&s;try in your common Di&s;cour&s;e? Have any of the Libels and Pamphlets, Print|ed either by the <HI>Examiner,</HI> or even <HI>Abel</HI> him&s;elf, come up to the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es Speech, Neck or Nothing,</HI> and the mul|titude of In&s;olencies in the <HI>Flying-Po&s;t</HI> upon the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try; and not only &s;o, but even the Per&s;on and Actions of the Queen her&s;elf.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on that your Friends have left you, and indeed are frighted from you? Why &s;o many who were Whigs in Principle, and that from their beginning, and remain Orthodox both in their Judg|ment and Practice to this Hour, as to the Love of Liberty, the Pre&s;ervation of the Con&s;titution, their Adherence to the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and to every Article on which our Natural Safety depends,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
are yet parted from you, amaz'd at your Conduct, and can neither in Honour or Con&s;cience, join with you? Is it not becau&s;e they &s;ee Railing and Cur&s;ing bitterly, which they are a&s;&s;ur'd is not a Chri&s;tian Spirit, is your daily Practice? Is it not becau&s;e they &s;ee you Breathing out Partial Judgments, and Po&s;itive Vengeance, things expre&s;ly forbidden to Man by the Laws of God; and that you point this Rage, not as Ju&s;tice, but as your Party and Pa&s;&s;ions direct? Is it not becau&s;e they &s;ee that you cover a Secret Per&s;onal De&s;ign again&s;t the pre|&s;ent Mini&s;ters of State, by the Pretence only of Publick Safety, when nothing appears to be Acted again&s;t the Publick Safety, or &s;o much as de&s;ign'd again&s;t it; and that in all your Conduct, you make the Charge again&s;t the Mini&s;try, to be rather Suppo&s;itious, than direct, the Fears of Popery, Tyranny, and the Pretender; Matter of Clamour, rather than of Sub|&s;tance; and the Grievances of the Nation &s;eem to be form'd in Imagination, not in the Evidence of Fact.</P>
<P>I would direct my Di&s;cour&s;e to you, <HI>(&s;uppo&s;ing, as before, that the&s;e things are &s;o)</HI> as Chri&s;tians, and as Subjects: As the fir&s;t, the Rule you ought to govern your
<PB N="15" REF="14" MS="Y">
&s;elves by, is direct, <HI>Thou &s;halt not revile the Gods, nor cur&s;e the Ruler of thy Peo|ple,</HI> Exodus 22. 28. <HI>Cur&s;e not the King, no not in thy Bed-chamber,</HI> &amp;c. Eccl. 10. 20. What &s;hare of Scandalous Reproaches has the Per&s;on of her Maje&s;ty, even in the Common Places of &s;ome Men? I could re|peat &s;uch Language, as even our fir&s;t Chri|&s;tians refus'd to give to the Heathen Per&s;e|cuting Emperors. With what Contempt is her Maje&s;ty treated in their Di&s;cour|&s;es? What &s;hould I name the <HI>Am&s;terdam, Young-Man</HI>'s, <HI>North</HI>'s, and other Coffee|hou&s;e Clubs, where the Queen is the Sub|ject of their utmo&s;t Scorn; and her Ma|je&s;ty, who at Church, they can hardly avoid making Prayers for as their Law|ful Sovereign; has their Cur&s;es, and In|decent Banters, all the Week after, as not fit to be tru&s;ted with the Government of the Nation.</P>
<P>What Language do they treat her Ma|je&s;ty's Servants with, who do their Work, and Serve them again&s;t their Will, com|mon Experience, and their own Hearts will te&s;tify; nor will they &s;ay they have &s;par'd them, or &s;par'd to e&s;pou&s;e tho&s;e Libellers, who have in the mo&s;t Infa|mous Manner revil'd them; and are the&s;e the Men who complain of the <HI>Examiner</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and, others for mal treating the Duke of <HI>M&mdash;gh?</HI> It had been a Good Argument indeed, could it not have been &s;aid, as <HI>Nathan</HI> to <HI>David, Thou art the Man;</HI> for no Man will plead for Per&s;onal Scurrillity again&s;t any, much le&s;s again&s;t Mini&s;ters of State, Honour'd by the Sovereign with the Greate&s;t Em|ployments, Tru&s;ted with the Admini&s;tra|tion of Government, Dignified with Titles and Marks of Honour and Di|&s;tinction: But it comes unhappily out of your Mouths, if in the &s;ame Breath that you Complain of it on one &s;ide, you Practice it in the Cour&s;e&s;t and Vile&s;t manner imaginable on the other; not again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of State only, but even again&s;t the Queen her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let no Man call this a Charge upon you, unle&s;s he can fir&s;t &s;ay it is not true in Fact; and if we &s;hould be Summon'd upon &s;uch a Denial, to enter upon the Proof, I fear there would not fail a cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>Viva-Voce,</HI> and Te&s;timonies, from the Printed Oracles of the People who I &s;peak of; but I chu&s;e to appeal to Con&s;cience, as &s;uiting be&s;t the Nature of an Expo&s;tulation, and therein I am &s;ure I have a Living Witne&s;s in your own Brea&s;ts, who will not &s;uffer you to give
<PB N="17" REF="16" MS="Y">
me the Trouble of calling in further Evidence; <HI>This, indeed, is managing the Complaints of Grievances, in an unju&s;ti|&s;iable and unchri&s;tian Manner,</HI> which is the fir&s;t Head laid down by tho&s;e who complain of the Conduct of the Whigs at this Time; and I fear the Charge lies too clo&s;e upon you to be denied.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have been &s;peaking to you as Chri&s;tians, it were to be wi&s;h'd you would always act like &s;uch: Let me turn this Admonition to you now, as Subjects, and fir&s;t, as Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch many of you are; The Church of <HI>England</HI> is famous thro' the World, for her &s;teddy Adherence to the Monarchy, Zeal for Legal E&s;tabli&s;hment, and Loyalty to the Per&s;ons of her Princes, and has many times &s;uffered deeply in this Cau&s;e; Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee you con&s;tantly attending her Wor&s;hip, cleaving to her Communion, and own|ing her Doctrine, and yet thus Aban|doning her in your Practice? With what Hearts can you call her Mother, and your &s;elves Obedient Children, and yet act in a manner &s;o directly contrary to her Doctrine and Canon, which teaches Subjection and Obedience to the Laws,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
What Scandal does this bring upon the Church you profe&s;s to adhere to? But &s;hall I chu&s;e to &s;peak to you as Subjects of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchy? What &s;hall we &s;ay for you? And what Excu&s;e can be found in your Behalf? Suppo&s;e as you do, that Obedience is pre&s;crib'd by Rules, and a reciprocal Obligation takes place between Prince and People: Nay, carry it to what length you plea&s;e, or to the greate&s;t length it was ever carried, by tho&s;e who were for any Con&s;titution at all of King and People; none ever pretended to deny, but that the Obedi|ence and Subjection of Subjects, was their unque&s;tion'd Duty, while their Kings Govern'd Righteou&s;ly, and main|tain'd their Laws and Liberties; but all the things which you are Complain'd of for, are done, while you have not the lea&s;t pretence to make upon your Gover|nours, either of the Laws being broken, or Rights Invaded.</P>
<P>Nor can the Di&s;pute about Pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience, or whether Pa&s;&s;ive or no, be con|cern'd in this Quarrel, here is no Argument about Re&s;i&s;tance or Non-re&s;i&s;tance before you. That Seditious Sermon, which &s;can|daliz'd a Pulpit lately, by a&s;&s;erting the Lawfulne&s;s of taking up Arms again&s;t a
<PB N="19" REF="18" MS="Y">
Tyrant, cannot be &s;aid to have any Re|lation to your Ca&s;e; for your Re&s;i&s;tance is again&s;t your Sovereign and her Admini|&s;tration, while no Tyranny appears, and while no Breach of Laws is pretended: Some have di&s;puted indeed, Whether it be Lawful to Re&s;i&s;t, even in ca&s;e of the Prince's Invading the Con&s;titution? but that is quite out of the Que&s;tion here; for none ever Sugge&s;ted it Lawful to Re&s;i&s;t, where no Laws were broken, or for Private and Per&s;onal Oppre&s;&s;ion; much le&s;s with|out it; and where there is no Tyranny, no Oppre&s;&s;ion or Arbitrary Power put in practice, either Per&s;onal or National; as is your Ca&s;e: And therefore quoting the Sermon above, I call it SEDITIOUS, becau&s;e pretending to prove the Lawful|ne&s;s of Re&s;i&s;ting Tyrants, he brings the Ex|ample of <HI>David</HI> taking Arms again&s;t <HI>Saul;</HI> Now <HI>Saul,</HI> however, he might have Per&s;onally pur&s;ued or injur'd <HI>David,</HI> was yet no Tyrant to his People, nor was he ever charg'd in Scripture with being &s;o, nay, he was no bad Governor, but on the contrary, was a Good King, tho' a Bad Man; nay, and he is by <HI>David</HI> him|&s;elf acknowledged to be &s;o, and his glo|rious Acts and Beneficence to his People are celebrated by <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf after the
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and all po&s;&s;ible Duty to the Sovereign? di&s;a&s;ter of his Death; 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1. 24. <HI>Ye daughters of I&s;rael weep over Saul, who cloathed you in &s;carlet with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</HI> V. 23. <HI>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and plea&s;ant in their Lives,</HI> &amp;c. Would the Scripture have &s;aid this of a Tyrant? <HI>Saul</HI> being then no Tyrant, and the example of <HI>David</HI> being brought in this que&s;tion of Re&s;i&s;tance, who took up Arms again&s;t him in his own private Quarrel; What is this but to Authorize the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, or any private Per&s;on or Party, to take up Arms again&s;t any King or Queen, tho' they are not Tyrants, when-ever any private Per&s;on plea&s;es to think him&s;elf Injur'd or Op|pre&s;s'd, and therefore I mu&s;t be allow'd to call it a &s;editious Sermon.</P>
<P>Nor is this an Injurious Sugge&s;tion, if it be con&s;idered how this Di&s;cour&s;e was Calculated, at a time when other Prints are full of Threatning Speeches, in the very Teeth of the Government; when the Cabals of Officers, who yet remain in half Pay, tho' ill de&s;erving that Boun|ty, have openly In&s;ulted and Threaten'd
<PB N="21" REF="20" MS="Y">
the Admini&s;tration, when we have been told in the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and other Papers, That your Forces are broken, yet you have a great Leader to call over; and another Book lately quoted by the <HI>Exa|miner,</HI> is Frontispiec'd with this Allarm|ing Ver&s;e

<P>This is down right menacing the Go|vernment, and &s;ounding to Arms, and may rea&s;onably be allow'd, (they &s;ay) as a &s;ufficient Proof of the &s;econd Article, (viz.) <HI>That the Heats upon the&s;e Com|plaints, are carried, by the Whigs, to an &V;nju&s;tifiable Extreme.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, it may be reflected here, that the Preacher of this Sermon is a Di&s;&s;enter; I an&s;wer, as it has been thought a great Injury to the Whigs, to endeavour to divide the Di&s;&s;enters from them, &s;o, on the other hand, it is to be &s;aid, to the Honour of the Di&s;&s;enters, that not a Man in a Hundred of them, approve that Flame-kindling Di&s;cour&s;e, but Univer&s;ally Condemn it, and blame the Preacher of it, as a Ra&s;h Uncon&s;i|dering Young Man, who, to gratify a

Party, has done a manife&s;t Injury to his Friends the Di&s;&s;enters, expo&s;ing them to the ju&s;t Reflection, which approving his Di&s;cour&s;e, would bring upon them; but the Whigs, nay, <HI>ab&s;tractedly &s;peaking,</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> Whigs, have been the Men, who have chiefly Embrac'd, Own'd, Care&s;s'd, and Courted, both the Sermon (and the Preacher of it) and have di&s;pers'd them over the whole Nation; while the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves, who&s;e Eyes, indeed, began to be open'd, and who began to &s;ee they have been impos'd upon, have, as above, generally &s;hewn their di&s;like of it, and, as I have been inform'd, have reprov'd him for it.</P>
<P>Before I go on, to put you in mind of what remains, let me calmly Debate the Ju&s;tice, the Prudence, and the Chri&s;tianity of this Conduct, while at the &s;ame time, Two Things are in your Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. That no E&s;&s;ay has yet been made, notwith&s;tanding frequent Challenges has been given to you to that purpo&s;e, to produce any act of Tyranny or Oppre&s;&s;i+on; any Laws Tran&s;gre&s;s'd; Liberties Invaded; Con&s;titution Broken; or Trea|&s;ure mi&s;applied, either by the Queen, or any of her Mini&s;ters of State.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="22" MS="Y">
2. That really all the&s;e Menaces, are not the Effect of your own Power, or any Pro&s;pect you have, that you are in the lea&s;t able to make that Re&s;i&s;tance you &s;peak of, but a meer Pre&s;umption upon the Lenity and Loo&s;ene&s;s of the Admini&s;tration; and a Suppo&s;ition, that they will not think it worth while to Re&s;ent the&s;e things; which pre&s;ump|tion you are, I confe&s;s, too much encou|rag'd in, for want of needful Examples being made where Ju&s;tice requir'd, and the Law has provided; but of that here|after.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, makes a full Proof of what I told you; they have Alledg'd as to the Behaviour of the Whigs, and its being Unju&s;tifiable and Unchri&s;tian; for where is the pretence for it? The Impar|tial part of Mankind infi&s;t upon this De|mand, and that it is ju&s;t that you &s;hould agree to it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Let all you can &s;ay be brought to the Te&s;t of the Law, and let the Mini&s;try be fairly Accus'd, or fairly Vindi|cated; indeed, this is but a rea&s;onable Pro|po&s;al; for to Charge Men upon Su&s;pition, is but a &s;lender part of a Chri&s;tian u&s;age, &amp; therefore our Con&s;titution anciently pro|vided Grand Juries, fir&s;t to examin the Evi|dence
<PB N="24" REF="23">
of Fact, and try whether there was &s;ufficient ground to put a Man's Life in Hazard; if not, the <HI>Bill</HI> is re|turn'd <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> the Party Accus'd is Di&s;mi&s;s'd, and the Charge judg'd <HI>Frivo|lous</HI> and <HI>Vexatious.</HI> Now &s;hall the whole Admini&s;tration of the Govern|ment be Condemn'd by a Foul Mouth, or Cen&s;ur'd by Sugge&s;tion! Let &s;ome Evidence of Fact appear, or the whole Nation, who are the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> in this Ca&s;e, will judge the Accu&s;ation <HI>Frivo|lous</HI> and <HI>Vexatious.</HI></P>
<P>How many Railing Pamphlets, Abu|&s;ive Libels, and Scurrillous Invectives, have been Publi&s;h'd and Di&s;pers'd among us, to animate and Enrage the People again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of State? And not one that ever I met with, amounted to a Charge of any Crime, an Evidence of Fact, or to &s;tate the particular Statute, again&s;t which they have Offended; all Indictments of Crime, run in the&s;e Words, <HI>CONTRARY TO THE STA|T&V;TE IN THAT CASE MADE AND PROVIDED,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> has Learnedly &s;et forth, how Mini&s;ters of State are ac|countable to the Laws; Who ever que|&s;tion'd it? Another has warmly taught
<PB N="25" REF="24" MS="Y">
his Congregation that it is Lawful to take up Arms again&s;t a Tyrant, which he proves by the Example of <HI>David,</HI> who took up Arms again&s;t a King that was no Tyrant.</P>
<P>But neither the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or any one Author, that has yet written or &s;poken upon this Subject, has ever &s;et Down any one Article which the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters of State have broken the Law in, or any one act of Tyranny in the Queen, or under her Suffer|ance: Mr. <HI>Wal&mdash;le</HI> in his Speech to the Inhabitants of <HI>Lyn,</HI> if &s;uch a Speech cou'd come from &s;uch a Per&s;on, Concludes thus, <HI>You may be a&s;&s;ur'd we will &s;truggle hard for our Religion and Liberties:</HI> But tells them not one &s;tep taken by the Queen or the Mini&s;ters of State, by which our Religion or Liberties have been attack'd; a Speech which &s;avours of as much Ju&s;tice, as that other part of it does of Mo|de&s;ty, where he tells them, <HI>That chu&s;ing HIM &s;or their Repre&s;entative, will make them &s;amous to Po&s;terity.</HI> The&s;e things &s;till add to the abun|dant Te&s;timony we have of the Second Head abovemention'd <HI>(viz.)</HI> That <HI>our Heats in the Complaints we make, are Carried on to an &V;n|warantable and &V;nchri&s;tian Extreme.</HI></P>
<P>But let me Expo&s;tulate a little freely with you on the next thing, <HI>(viz.)</HI> What is the foundation of Power that you go upon? Have the Whigs Hands to make good what they have Mouths to utter? Do you believe that every Man who &s;its &s;till and quietly Hears you Threaten and Menace the Queen and the Admini&s;tration, would al&s;o &s;it &s;till, and qui|etly
<PB N="26" REF="25">
let you fall upon them and tear them to pieces? Nay, Do you believe that even tho&s;e, or but one Tenth part of tho&s;e who Joyn with you in the Indecencies of the Tongue, and perhaps are forward enough to Rail and Cla|mour with you at your Governours, will find Zeal An&s;werable to their pre&s;ent Stock of &s;omething el&s;e; to lay their Lives at Pledge, and &s;pend their Blood as freely as they now &s;pend their Breath, in &s;o Wicked a Quarrel: Perhaps were it for Religion and Liberty they might; But can you think they will do it as it is now? What then are you doing! Threatning Government, without Power to attack them, is like a Man &s;etting Fire to a Magazine of Pow|der, and not giving him&s;elf time to get out of the Bla&s;t.</P>
<P>We have a &s;ort of Men who go about whi&s;pering their Threats, and Ca&s;ting out In&s;olence by Inuendo; when they &s;peak of the Mini&s;ters of State thus, <HI>Well,</HI> they had be&s;t have a Care&punc; they do not know where this mav end! <HI>Sure!</HI> they will never Venture to to Di&s;&s;olve the Parliament of <HI>Ireland! well,</HI> if they do, they may pull an old Hou&s;e upon their Heads! <HI>well</HI> Certainly they will never ven|ture to &s;ettle a Commerce with <HI>France!</HI> They do not know what a &s;tir it may make among the People! <HI>So formerly,</HI> They will never Dare to make a Peace without the Confederates! if they do, let them look to it, and the like! I need not repeat tho&s;e things, there are too many of them in the Argument.</P>
<P>This is Certain, a Mini&s;try ought to Dare to do every Lawful thing, when the &s;afety of
<PB N="27" REF="26" MS="Y">
the Admini&s;tration makes that Lawful thing Expedient; as to the Lawfulne&s;s they are not judges, but are liable to be que&s;tion'd at any time by a Supreme Judicatory; but as to the Expedience thereof they are entirely Judges of it, and therefore if acted in the ordinary Method as all wi&s;e Mini&s;ters act, <HI>(viz.)</HI> in the Privy Council, they are no farther an|&s;werable than as to the Legality of what they do; if it were not &s;o, no Man of Honour or Sub&s;tance would be a Mini&s;ter of State; no Man would venture upon the Employment, but he who&s;e Fortune was De&s;perate, and val|lued no Ri&s;que.</P>
<P>But to return to the Power which you have to Execute the Threats you dayly let fall, it were to be wi&s;hed you would take back the Warnings which you hint to the Mini&s;try, and let them &s;ound in your own Ears thus: Sure! you will not go on thus! Sure! you can|not think the Mini&s;ters of State will always be Remi&s;s! The Government it &s;elf mu&s;t fall, if the Queen will bear her Officers to be In&s;ulted in the Execution of their Office. This is &s;tab|bing Men <HI>La Mode de Gui&s;card</HI> at the very Council-Table. The fury of the Tongue is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Violence, and a Man of a Railing Spirit is the wor&s;t Per&s;ecutor; Slan|der is the wor&s;t A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>There are that &s;peak like the piercing of a &s;word.</HI> Surely then you will not go on thus! Can you think the Government will never Ex|ert it &s;elf! and that Re&s;entment will never take place of Lenity and Clemency! And where will this end but in the Ruin of the
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Agre&s;&s;ors! And what can you expect, but the De&s;olation of your &s;elves in the fir&s;t act of Violence?</P>
<P>I am not talking to you as if you thought you were in condition to Arm, I will not &s;uppo&s;e you &s;o di&s;tracted neither; for tho' you &s;eem to threaten high, yet you cannot but be too &s;en|&s;ible of your ab&s;olute Nakedne&s;s, as to Power; you neither have the rea&s;on of Arming to plead, nor the People to Arm; The attempt would but Gratify your Enemies too much, who, tho' they have not &s;o mean an Opinion of your Prudence as to hope for it, would yet be well plea&s;ed that you would give them that Oppor|tunity to Ruin you.</P>
<P>But I am &s;uppo&s;ing your Greate&s;t pro&s;pect of Power is, that you by popular Clamour would alarm the People with the Notion of &s;ome Imediate Danger, and by this, if po&s;&s;i|ble, bring them over to be Tumultuous in your Favour, and &s;o make them Unea&s;ie to the Government.</P>
<P>But let not the&s;e Hopes deceive you, <HI>Eng|land,</HI> tho' a Country full of Civil Di&s;&s;entions, Cannot give one Example where ever the Peo|ple were Drawn in to rai&s;e a Clamour and Tu|mult at the Mini&s;try, when no Breach of Laws was to be laid to their Charge.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that Favourites in <HI>England</HI> have always been the Subjects of the Peoples Hatred and Envy, and in &s;ome re&s;pect it has been true; but I mu&s;t do the People that Ju&s;tice to add, that it was always becau&s;e of the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Violence of tho&s;e Favour|ites: Their unbounded Avarice, their Agran|dizing
<PB N="29" REF="28" MS="Y">
their Families at the Nations Expence; Their Obtaining Exorbitant Grants, Mi&s;apli|cation of Trea&s;ure, Perverting Ju&s;tice, Em|barking the Nation in hazardous and fruitle&s;s Wars, and Expeditions, and the like; and the Voice of the People in all tho&s;e Ca&s;es have been for Ju&s;tice, fair Charges have been brought, Legal Impeachments, and &s;olemn Tryals de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>But where is the Example, (Times of Civil War and Rebellion excepted) that the Peo|ple were brought to fall upon Mini&s;ters of State, with Sugge&s;ted Crimes only, and tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of State, &s;tanding fairly out, and Challenging to have any thing Prov'd upon them? Nay, when you cannot but own, that here is no Family Agrandiz'd; no Man made Rich by the Spoil of the Subject; no Blood Unrighteou&s;ly Shed; but a <HI>Virgin Reign,</HI> of which <HI>England</HI> can never &s;hew the like in all her Hi&s;tory, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That in Twelve Years, not one Man has &s;o much as been Tried for his Life, either for Trea&s;on, or for any Offence again&s;t her Maje&s;ty or her Government; no Blood has been Shed; not one Execution in all her Maje&s;ty's Reign, Common Malefactors only excepted.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try, Court your Impeachments, and Demand to be Charg'd: They &s;ay as the Good Old Judge of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> God's Mini&s;ter of State, at the end of the Theocracy, of the Tribes, <HI>Who&s;e Ox, or who&s;e A&s;s have I ta|ken?</HI> &amp;c. and no Man &s;tands forth to Accu&s;e them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
But without Accu&s;ation, without Legal Charge, much le&s;s Legal Tryal, you fall upon them with Sugge&s;tions and Suppo&s;itions, and do you think ever to bring the People over to join in &s;uch a Charge? I would per&s;wade you not to Deceive your &s;elves with the Hope of a thing &s;o Improbable; let your own Rea&s;on lead you to judge, when you offer the lea&s;t Clamour among the People, to inflame them again&s;t the Mini&s;try, and they are told the Mini&s;try appeal to the Laws, that you can|not Prove your Charge, and that they de&s;ire a fair Tryal, from that Moment your Clamour will cea&s;e to be Popular; for Mobbs may out|run the Bounds of their Duty, and go beyond Law; but you never knew the Mobb of this Nation ri&s;e up again&s;t the Law, or refu&s;e to be &s;atisfied, when the Per&s;on they Charg'd, was given up to Law.</P>
<P>As then you have no Legal Charge again&s;t the Mini&s;ters of State, let me then Argue a lit|tle with you, the Ju&s;tice, the Prudence and the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Methods you take.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e is all this de&s;perate Feud carried on? Can you think ever to prevail either with the Queen to di&s;place Her Mini|&s;ters, or the People to de&s;ire it, while you can bring no Legal Complaints again&s;t them? You &s;ee they &s;tand you fair; they have not procur'd Indemnities and Pardons (as others did before them, and who, <HI>by the way,</HI> you your &s;elves then Charg'd with doing it, to &s;helter them&s;elves) for their Security.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30" MS="Y">
How much fairer a Pretence have the&s;e Men had, for a General Act of Indemnity, than ever the other had <HI>(viz.) upon the Peace,</HI> when Cu&s;tom &s;eem'd to call for it, Forreign Princes did it, and the Example made our People not only expect it, but, not a few, even of your &s;ide, have had Occa&s;ion for it, and De&s;ir'd it; yet the Mini&s;ters of State have Declin'd it, to let you &s;ee they &s;tand in no need of any thing of that kind; That they repo&s;e their Safety in the Ju&s;tice of the Law, and are rea|dy to appeal to that ju&s;tice in every Clamour you can rai&s;e.</P>
<P>If then the Law Condemns them not, are you greater than the Law, that you take upon you to Cen&s;ure Men before any Legal Pro&s;e|cution is Commenc'd? I be&s;eech you call to mind the Words of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, when he was In&s;olently abu&s;ed by the Clamouring Party of his Accu&s;ers John 18. 23. <HI>If I have &s;poken Evil, bear witne&s;s of the Evil,</HI> That is, Indict me, and bring me to the Bar, and there be a Witne&s;s again&s;t me, let the proper Judicature determine of it and Judge me. <HI>But if Well, why &s;mite&s;t thou me?</HI> Let us turn the Ble&s;&s;ed Complaint in a lower Ca&s;e, If the Mini&s;ters of State have done Evil, <HI>Bear witne&s;s of that Evil,</HI> Impeach them before tho&s;e who are the proper Judges of it; <HI>But if Well,</HI> if they have not Broken the Laws, Invaded the Con&s;titution, Acted Unrighteou&s;ly, <HI>&amp;c.

Would you not call it Arbitrary and Tyrannical, to be proceeded again&s;t in &s;uch a manner, and to be Condemn'd without a Tryal? To come now to the pretended Ground of the pre&s;ent Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, as to the De&s;ign of it, I &s;hall &s;peak to that afterwards, God knows that is the wor&s;t part.</P>
<P>The Clamour now rai&s;ed, is the Danger of the Pretender: This is the only remaining Pretence, Let us Enquire into the Ground of That.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, if I might but appeal to your &s;elves, that like &s;ome of the wi&s;er Je&s;uits, who when they have been acting the Extrava|gancies of their Fraternity, have been &s;aid, not to believe them&s;elves: It is not po&s;&s;ible you can believe your &s;elves; what &s;ome|times you &s;ay on that Head, is &s;o di&s;concerted, and &s;o Irrational, as well as unju&s;t, that it is impo&s;&s;ible but it mu&s;t &s;hock you: Not to men|tion the Ab&s;urdities of the pre&s;ent day, the Army drawing down to <HI>Bologn</HI> Ships fitting out at <HI>Brest,</HI> the Pretender gone from <HI>Bar-le-Duc,</HI> and the King of <HI>France</HI> preparing to put him upon us, immediately after the &s;o|lemne&s;t Treaty to the Contrary, and while the Queen was alive: The&s;e things were too

<P>But to go back to the General Ca&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Danger of the Pretender; for this is the <HI>Common Place</HI> now in all your Party Di&s;content.</P>
<P>Hitherto this is founded only in Clamour, and it is well known to your &s;elves, that this Cla|mour, if not Artfully Rai&s;ed, is Artfully Spread ju&s;t like that of the Queen's death, to Alarm the People, Terrify them with Apprehen&s;ions, and Awaken them to Tumult and Sedition.</P>
<P>I cannot but put you in mind, how, in the late Mini&s;try, you Complain'd of the Injury and Inju&s;tice of a like Clamour, about the Danger of the Church; and thought your &s;elves highly Injur'd, and her Maje&s;ty al&s;o; That under the Reign of a Queen, who&s;e Zeal for the Church of <HI>England</HI> had been &s;o emi|nently Di&s;tingui&s;ht, and under a Mini&s;try who were profe&s;s'd Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch a Sugge&s;tion &s;hould be rai&s;ed; the Church at the &s;ame time being in a SAFE

<P>It is a thing I would &s;eriou&s;ly recommend to you all, and your own Intere&s;t and Safety is Concern'd in it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That &s;ince you are not &s;ure the Mini&s;try are in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, only that you &s;ugge&s;t and affirm it without Proof, not Charging them with the lea&s;t &s;tep taken that way; you would concern your &s;elves, on the other hand, not to Abet and Encourage tho&s;e real Jacobites, who are in his Intere&s;t, by &s;uppo&s;ing that Party to be &s;tronger than it is, and by divi|ding

<P>What is more common in the Mouths of the Jacobites at this time, and from which their Greate&s;t Encouragement is deriv'd, than this; That they have brought, or &s;hall bring our Di&s;tru&s;t of one another, and the Auimo|&s;ities between the Whigs and the Mini&s;try, to &s;uch a height, as that they will not act in Con|cert, or Aid one another whatever the Occa&s;ion be, no not again&s;t the Pretender him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nothing, but this Animo&s;ity, can put us in Danger of the Pretender. I will do you the Ju&s;tice to own, you are far from being Jacobites in De&s;ign, but in <HI>this Sence,</HI> you may indeed with too much Truth, come at la&s;t to be Charg'd with being for the Pretender your &s;elves, and that in the wor&s;t Sence; at lea&s;t, you may be Involuntary Agents, in his put|ting him&s;elf upon us, which in the end, would be the wor&s;t way of being in his Intere&s;t. If we are United together, not <HI>France</HI> A$road,
<PB N="37" REF="36" MS="Y">
<HI>if I &s;hould grant that</HI> France <HI>would Embark in it,</HI> not <HI>Rome,</HI> not <HI>Jacobites</HI> at Home, not all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> could Impo&s;e him upon us; but while a Secret Animo&s;ity Reigns among us at the Mini&s;try, to that Degree, that you would &s;carce join with them again&s;t the In|va&s;ions of Popery and the Pretender; How &s;hould we but be apprehen&s;ive of him? In &s;hort, all the In&s;olence of the Jaco|bites, all the Encouragement of the Pretender, derive from this Bitterne&s;s in the Root, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the de&s;perate Divi&s;ions of Parties, and the height of Madne&s;s to which we are come: So that it is to be que&s;tion'd, Whether we &s;hould Join or no, even again&s;t the Common Enemy of us all.</P>
<P>If two Families in one Hou&s;e &s;hould Quar|rel with, and Hate one another, &s;o that when the Hou&s;e was on Fire, they would not a&s;&s;i&s;t one another to quench it, who would In&s;ure that Hou&s;e from Burning?</P>
<P>Let no Man &s;ay, that I carry this too far, unle&s;s they will An&s;wer, in the Name of the People I am &s;peaking of, to this plain Que&s;ti|on; and I appeal to your own Con&s;ciences, who call your &s;elves <HI>Whigs,</HI> that it is a fair Que|&s;tion; Are there not &s;ecret Jealou&s;ies among you, lea&s;t this Mini&s;try &s;hould bring in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover?</HI> Would you be willing the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;hould owe their ready Acce&s;s to the Throne, at the Queen's Decea&s;e, to this Party, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, or to &s;uch of them as &s;hould be Living at that time? I will not &s;ay, you had rather not have them at all, <HI>tho' I know &s;ome of you have Threat|en'd</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="37">
<HI>that, and much more.</HI> But Sugge&s;t it calmly to your own Thoughts, I demand no An&s;wer; An&s;wer it to your own Con&s;ciences, as you &s;hall An&s;wer for it to one that knows what your Con&s;ciences &s;ay to it; Would you be willing the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try &s;hould be the In&s;truments, Honour'd with Introducing the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or?</P>
<P>Nor is this Que&s;tion &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable or re|mote, that it &s;hould be thought needle&s;s to be ask'd &s;ince, you may depend upon it, as far as things appear, it will be your Ca&s;e; the Succe&s;&s;or will certainly be brought in upon the Foot of the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures, and it can be no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>How vain are the Hopes? And how full of all manner of Confu&s;ion, the Projects of tho&s;e Men, who think the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or mu&s;t come in here, upon the Foot of a Court Re|volution, enter into all the Party Re&s;ent|ments, and declare him&s;elf again&s;t one part, <HI>perhaps the Greate&s;t too,</HI> of his Subjects, as &s;oon as he comes to the Crown?</P>
<P>What a Satyr do you make upon his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to Sugge&s;t, that he who is a Sovereign Prince already, and not Ignorant of the Nature of Government, &s;hould come hi|ther, with Knit Brows, and a Drawn Sword; Arm'd with Party Rage, prepar'd to be the In|&s;trument, <HI>I might &s;ay the TOOL,</HI> to Execute the Revenge of one prevailing part of his People upon the other? What Mean and Sordid Opi|nion mu&s;t you have of the Per&s;on and Politicks of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or? Who, were he as you imagine him, would be at be&s;t but a PAR|TY|KING
<PB N="39" REF="38" MS="Y">
and would neither Merit the Crown he was to Po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor long keep it when he had it.</P>
<P>The true Intere&s;t of the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;or, would certainly be to compo&s;e our Di&s;orders, heal our Breaches, quiet our Minds, reconcile our Animo&s;ities, bring all the Na|tion to rejoice in his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, and &s;pread a Univer&s;al Smile upon the Coun|tenances OF his People; with a Face of Beneficence TO his People, and National Affection IN them, to his Per&s;on, forming a general Unanimity in Prince and People to the Publick Safety: The&s;e would be the nece&s;|&s;ary Attendants at the Acce&s;&s;ion of a Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, the Methods for which would be General Indemnities, Oblivion of Facts, and a Burying the Remembrance of all Di&s;contents.</P>
<P>But to Sugge&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or &s;hall &s;ide with Parties! call to Account tho&s;e who never Offended! keep alive our Feuds, and gratify the Pa&s;&s;ions and Fury of Men, either of one Party or of another! This is to bring him in as a Tyrant, as a Man prepar'd for Vengeance, and made, before hand, a Terrour to the Nation.</P>
<P>What Injury you do the Succe&s;&s;or him&s;elf, and his Intere&s;t in this, perhaps you are no$ aware of! Or what Inju&s;tice you do the Cha|racter and Honour of the Elector of <HI>Hanover;</HI> indeed he him&s;elf will be judge of it, and no doubt will be very &s;en&s;ible of it. I remember the fir&s;t Complaint again&s;t his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>William,</HI> was rai&s;ed by your &s;elves, <HI>for you mu&s;t allow me to tell you, however you may have &s;ince repented of that Crime, That</HI> the Whigs were the fir&s;t that mal-treated him after the Revolution,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
and it was upon this very Account&punc; <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he did not Dip in the Blood of the Na|tion at his fir&s;t coming over; That he did not make &s;ome Examples, <HI>as you then call'd it, for they are your own Words,</HI> and let the Ax and the Halter have made &s;ome Satisfaction to you for your Friends who had been Injur'd in the Precedent Reign.</P>
<P>But that Wi&s;e and Generous Prince, who under&s;tood Rules of Government perfectly well, and &s;aw to what Extremeties you would have Driven him, Rebuk'd your forwardne&s;s with the very Words of our Saviour to the Di&s;ciples that would ha' call'd for Fire from Heaven, &amp;c. <HI>Ye know not what &s;pirit ye are of.</HI> There are &s;ome of your Friends yet alive who Heard him &s;ay the very Words, and can Te&s;ti|fy the Truth of it; and Imediately his Maje&s;ty Directed an Act of Indemnity, knowing that the way to Set$$e the Nation in Peace, and re&s;tore a Compleat Tranquility, was not to make Men De&s;perate, but to make them Ea&s;ie: That Vengeance was re&s;erv'd to Omnipotence, and Men, tho' Injur'd, were not to be let loo&s;e to the Exerci&s;e of their Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>This, &s;ome never forgave him, and this was the Rea&s;on why Mr. <HI>Redpath</HI> in his <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI> reflected &s;o Rudely upon the Memory of the King, and &s;aid, he might have done more for <HI>England</HI> than he did. Which Crime he has however endeavour'd to make amends for &s;ince, by &s;everal Ways well known.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are mentioned now, only to let you &s;ee, That if you expect the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, to take YOUR METHODS at his
<PB N="41" REF="40" MS="Y">
coming hither, to declare for and again&s;t Parties, &s;uppre&s;s This, and erect That; you mu&s;t take him for a Prince of le&s;s Conduct, and le&s;s Under&s;tanding of his own Intere&s;t, and the Intere&s;t of the Conntry he is to Go|vern, than the Nation hopes to find him, and than you have any Rea&s;on to believe of him.</P>
<P>I will not threaten you with his Re&s;ent|ment of this Conduct of yours before he comes, as you are very forward to do to other Peo|ple. The Succe&s;&s;or, as he &s;tands clear of all Parties yet, &s;o, no que&s;tion, he will prepare <HI>to Govern</HI> all our Parties&punc; not to <HI>be Govern'd by</HI> them; if not, he will find him&s;elf le&s;s a King than we hope he De&s;igns to be.</P>
<P>And therefore your Threatning the Mini|&s;try and other People with the Re&s;entment of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or for their pre&s;ent Con|duct, is really Threatning the Succe&s;&s;or, and that many ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;uppo&s;ing, that you &s;hall be able to prevail upon him, &s;o to Unking him&s;elf, as to enter into the particular Intere&s;t of a part of his Subjects again&s;t the re&s;t; which I mu&s;t tell you, &s;uppo&s;es &s;omething very ill of his Cha|racter, and &s;omething, which Decency &s;uffers me not to Name. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. That, <HI>if not,</HI> you &s;hall have Power to oblige him to it; and both the&s;e Subject him to you, too much for you to pre&s;ume upon.</P>
<P>Would you be plea&s;ed to Weigh the&s;e Things, you will find them too weak for you
<PB N="42" REF="41">
to depend upon. You cannot expect, either to Per&s;wade or Oblige the Succe&s;&s;or, to carry on a Party Feud, he is too Wi&s;e a Prince; he will certainly endeavour to be King of all his People, and to have no Kings over him, or el&s;e he will have a very Uncomfortable Throne, and <HI>Britain</HI> a Confus'd Nation.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd, you would prepare rather to be Dutiful Subjects to the Succe&s;&s;or when he comes, than Dictators to him before he comes, lea&s;t you give him &s;uch a ta&s;te of your Loyalty, as &s;hall attack him to the Tories, who appear enclin'd to be better Sub|jects; and then your Party-hopes would all Die at once. And can you give your &s;elves a wor&s;e Character to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, than that of your Treatment of his Prede|ce&s;&s;or? Do you believe he will encline to you the rather becau&s;e of your being Unea&s;y to the Crown, or becau&s;e you are &s;o apt to make the pre&s;ent Government unea&s;y with you? He cannot but &s;ee, that you are not in the lea&s;t Oppre&s;s'd by this Government, only you are not plea&s;ed, and will your being &s;o hard to plea&s;e, &s;o Furious and Implacable when you are di&s;plea&s;ed, recommend you to him? I believe the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> no more enclin'd to be a Tyrant, than any Prince you can Name; but you cannot think he would be a King of Clouts, a King and no King, or that when he is once Crown'd, he would be willing to be &s;ent home again, every time his People are not plea&s;ed with him; he is not Ignorant how you acted with King <HI>William;</HI> how you thought your &s;elves
<PB N="43" REF="42" MS="Y">
never Rewarded &s;ufficiently for the Favour of bringing him in; and how you In&s;ulted him in the Tru&s;ts he be&s;towed on you: I be&s;eech you do not make the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> afraid of you, or out of love with you; I doubt you have not weighed the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e two Things, or indeed the Danger of them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, at the De|mi&s;e of the Queen (long may it be fir&s;t) &s;hould, to the Reproach of all the Scandal you have thrown upon them, Punctually and Honourably pre&s;erve the Throne for the Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, and with a Fidelity to their Country, &s;uitable to what Good Men believe of them, a&s;&s;i&s;t heartily to place him on the Throne, <HI>as most certainly they will,</HI> Will not that one Action convince the Succe&s;&s;or of the Wrong the&s;e Gentlemen have &s;uffer'd from you? And will it not fill him with the utmo&s;t Abhorrence of the Method you have taken, to Villify and Defame tho&s;e, who he &s;hall then have found to be his fa&s;t Friends? Will it not po&s;&s;e&s;s him with Contemptible Thoughts of your Per&s;ons, and a mo&s;t Abject Opinion of your Hone&s;ty? Will not all the ill Names you have ca&s;t on the Pre&s;ent Mini|&s;try, be then ju&s;tly ca&s;t back upon your &s;elves? And will not the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or him&s;elf, Reproach you with Abu&s;ing him, and treat you accordingly? Why &s;hould you put &s;o great a Hazard upon it, and gratify your pre&s;ent Humour of Oppo&s;ing and Mi&s;repre|&s;enting the Min&s;try, at the Expence of all the Intere&s;t that you have, or can hope to have in the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
I might Argue the Morality of your pre|&s;ent U&s;age of the Mini&s;try, as to the Char|ging them with being for the Pretender, and Charge you on the other hand, with the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice. But I am not Writing Satyrs, I am only calmly per&s;wading with you: I think the Que&s;tion may very rea&s;on|ably be offer'd you, which was offer'd to an Athei&s;t, who was Arguing again&s;t the Being and Sovereignty of a God, when one Gravely &s;aid to him, <HI>Sir, you own you are not &s;ure there is not a God, How if it &s;hould happen that you are Mi&s;taken, will you not own you have done him a great deal of Wrong?</HI> Thus, if at la&s;t it &s;hould appear, that the Pre&s;ent Min&s;try, are really not in the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, <HI>&s;uppo&s;e it only for Argument &s;ake,</HI> will you not own that you have done them a great deal of Wrong? But I am pleading your own Inte|re&s;t, a Wi&s;e Man will never run the hazard of doing that, which he &s;hall be afterwards a&s;ham'd of: If ever it &s;hould appear, that the Pre&s;ent Mini&s;try are really and &s;incerely not for the Pretender, How will you &s;ee Cau&s;e to Recant, and Acknowledge your &s;elves Mi|&s;taken?</P>
<P>In the mean time, as no Proof of the Fact lies again&s;t them, and you have only a Suppo&s;i|tion without Ground, that Suppo&s;ition cannot ju&s;tify the Language and Treatment we now give them.</P>
<P>From the Clau&s;e of Charging the Mini&s;try with being for the Pretender; let me Expo|&s;tulate a little with you about the Pre&s;ent Alarms rai&s;ed about the Town of the Pre|tender
<PB N="45" REF="44" MS="Y">
being actually Coming, or Come, and that not &s;o much as to the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Allarms, as the De&s;igns of rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P>To enter into an Examination of the Fact it &s;elf, how it was not only Fal&s;e, but Ab&s;urd and Ridiculous. To enquire how many Ficti|ons were nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;ed, to &s;upport the Credit of the main part of the Story, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That there was a Squadron of <HI>French</HI> Men of War equipping at <HI>Bre&s;t;</HI> That there was an Army of 14000 Men, drawn down to <HI>Bologne;</HI> That the Pretender was gone away from <HI>Bar|le duc,</HI> and that it was not known there whither he was gone; but that he was Actually Em|barking, &amp;c. I &s;ay, to enter into the&s;e Facts would be needle&s;s; it is enough to &s;ay, That ye very well know, and I fear &s;ome knew from the Beginning&punc; that not one of them had any Truth in them; That there was no Squadron of Ships fitting out; not a Regiment of Men come to <HI>Bologne,</HI> or within an Hundred Miles of it, more than the or|dinary Garri&s;ons, who were in their former Station; That it was known where the Pre|tender was, and that he was gone to <HI>Lunne|ville</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and no where el&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Time, and Enquiry into things, having Di&s;covered all this; it remains to &s;ay, that the&s;e Rumours mu&s;t then be a Political Step, taken to try an Experiment upon the People; and to &s;ee if, and how far they were capable of being Influenc'd, perhaps for a wor&s;e De&s;ign; but that which I would ob&s;erve to you upon it is, How does this look? What Reputation
<PB N="46" REF="45">
does &s;uch Practice bring to the Whigs? Where is the Morality, the Honour, and the Chri&s;ti|anity of rai&s;ing Political Fal&s;hoods? Is it to Amu&s;e and Di&s;tract the People, and try whe|ther they can be provok'd to Tumult and Di&s;order? On who&s;e Head then mu&s;t the Blood fall that may be &s;pilt in &s;uch a Quarrel? And what a wretched &s;tep is that of Fal&s;hood, Forgery, Lying, and Deceit, to carry on a Good Cau&s;e with? This never was the Practice of the Whigs before; and this makes &s;o many of the Whigs, who&s;e Principles cannot de|&s;cend to &s;uch low Steps, &s;tand at a di&s;tance from you now, A&s;toni&s;h'd and Amaz'd, and waiting for that happy time, when you &s;hall be brought to your &s;elves again.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak a little to the Policy of this Conduct; your own Experience may convince you who felt the &s;mart of it fir&s;t; the Banks, the Stocks, the Funds, in who&s;e Hands are they? If your own Words are to be believ'd, the Whigs have Three Fourths of them all; And who then have you let into the Secret but your &s;elves? Is not the BITER BITTEN? Have you not run down your own E&s;tates? Sold your own Stocks to Lo&s;s? And le&s;&s;en'd your own Intere&s;t? Did not the Tories buy your Bank Stock, and <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock, at Four to Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> lo&s;s? And do they not now Sell you your own E&s;tates at an Advance, and put <HI>your</HI> Money in <HI>their</HI> Pocket? Thus while you have acted a part to make an Experiment upon the Nation, you have done it at your own Expence, and your Enemies Laugh at you.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46" MS="Y">
This very thing is an Emblem of your whole Ca&s;e, and ju&s;t thus you act as to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; Should the Queen Die, you would cry out of the Pretender; fright the People out of their Wits; Ruin your Banks and Companies Stocks all at once; Sell out at Twenty and Thirty <HI>per Cent.</HI> lo&s;s, and undo your own Friends; this will certainly be your own Ca&s;e then; when after this, immediately the Mini&s;ters of State maintaining a due Con|cert with the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, &s;hall calm|ly and quietly give him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown, upon the Foot of their own Mea&s;ures, and then you will come to give Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> again for your Own E&s;tates: The Sum of the whole Matter is this.</P>
<P>I would fain per&s;wade you to con&s;ider the&s;e Things, and Study the Quiet and Security of your Country; join with all them that join with you in the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and not put the Mini&s;try to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aving you again&s;t your Wills, and convincing the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, that your Mea&s;ures are Fal&s;e, your Charge upon the Mini&s;try Groundle&s;s, and that by Con&s;equence you are not the Party which he ought to de|pend upon.</P>
<P>I have not room here to enter upon the la&s;t Head propos'd, <HI>(viz.)</HI> To Remind you what an Imprudent and Unju&s;tifiable Hazard, the&s;e things put your Country and Po&s;terity in; take them in a few Heads. (1.) The real Hazard to us of the Pretender from it all: Nothing but the&s;e Heats among us, giving him and his Party any Hopes. (2.) The Ha|zard

to your &s;elves, in provoking the Govern|ment you thus oppo&s;e, to make u&s;e of, and exert the Legal Power they are Ve&s;ted with, in Mortifying and Suppre&s;&s;ing you. (3.) The Hazard Po&s;terity &s;hall run, by Bringing all your Intere&s;t, Friends, and Party, into a Broil, even with the Succe&s;&s;or him&s;elf; of all which, I &s;hall take an Occa&s;ion to Expo&s;tulate with you farther, as Opportunity offers.</P>
