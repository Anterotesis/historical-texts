<L>When, or how &s;oon we cannot know,</L>
<L>But late or early, we are &s;ure to go,</L>
<L>In the fre&s;h Bloom of Youth, or wither'd Age;</L>
<L>We cannot take too &s;edulous a care.</L>
<L>In this Important, grand Affair;</L>
<L>For as we dye, we mu&s;t remain,</L>
<L>Hereafter all our hopes are vain</L>
<L>To make our Peace with Heaven, or to return again</L>
<L>The Heathen, who no better under&s;tood,</L>
<L>Than what the Light of Nature taught, declar'd</L>
<L>No future Mi&s;eries could be prepar'd</L>
<L>For the Sincere, the Merciful, the Good;</L>
<L>But if there were a State of Re&s;t,</L>
<L>They &s;hould with the &s;ame happine&s;s be ble&s;t</L>
<L>As the Immortal Gods, (if Gods there were) po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>We have the promi&s;e of Eternal Truth,</L>
<L>They who live well, and pious Paths pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>To Man, and to their Maker true,</L>
<L>Let'm expire in Age or Youth,</L>
<L>Age or Youth can never mi&s;s</L>
<L>Their way to Everla&s;ting Bli&s;s:</L>
<L>But from a World of Mi&s;ery and Care</L>
<L>To Man&s;ions of Eternal Ea&s;e repair;</L>
<L>Where Joy in full perfection flows;</L>
<L>And in an endle&s;s Circle move</L>
<L>Thro' the va&s;t Round of a Beatific Love,</L>
<L>Which no Ce&s;&s;ation knows.</L>
