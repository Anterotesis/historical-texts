<HEAD>THE WOOD NYMPH AND THE FAUN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>AN IDYL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>IN THE MANNER OF G$SNER.</HEAD>
<P>'T WAS a &s;ultry &s;ummer's day, when a Wood-Nymph, wearied with the chace, evaded her com|panions; and, withdrawing into a grove, lay down to &s;leep, with her how and quiver by her &s;ide. She had not lain long, before a young Faun came tr$pping by. "Ho! ho!" c$$ed he, "what a cha$ming Nymph is here! how inviting! and a&s;leep too&punc; Now will I &s;teal a &s;weet ki&s;s. But, hold! I &s;hall awake her. N$, I'll hide her bow and quiver, and watch among the bu&s;hes till the wakes, and then&mdash;But, h$$t! I &s;hall be di&s;coverexd." So &s;aying, he gathered them up, and hid him&s;elf among the bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Nymph waked, and looked around her&mdash;"My bow and quiver are gone!" &s;he exclaimed: "never &s;hall I get others like them. Alas! alas!" Then, hiding her face in her hands, &s;he wept.</P>
<P>The Faun ran to her. "Pretty Nymph, I have &s;een thy how, and know where thy quiver is hid. Oh! 'tis the prettie&s;t quiver!"&mdash;"Give me my bow!" cried the Nymph, "and my pretty quiver, wicked Faun! you have &s;tolen them away."</P>
<P>"Nay," &s;aid the Faun, "don't be cro&s;s, and I'll &s;hew thee thy quiver and bow."</P>
<P>"Shew me them, quickly," replied the Nymph.</P>
<P>"Yes, but fir&s;t," an&s;wered the Faun, "thou mu&s;t go to my neat little grot; and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I go to thy grot?" cried the beautiful maid.</P>
<P>"Why not?" returned the ivy-crowned chaunter of Bacchus. "Thou &s;halt drink from my pretty brown jug; and I'll lull thee to &s;leep with my flute. No Faun can &s;urpa&s;s me in &s;ong; and I'll &s;ing of thy beauty, &s;weet Nymph! Thine eyes will I compare to the contents of my jug, who&s;e &s;parkling bewitches the &s;oul; thy &s;anciful ringlets of hair, to the wantonly curling tendrils that
<PB N="12" REF="12">
play on the &s;hining forehead of the youthful Bacchus; thy mouth&mdash;but to &s;o lovely a mouth Apollo him&s;elf would barely do ju&s;tice&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Cea&s;e thy trifling," interrupted the frowning Nymph; "and re&s;tore to me what thou ha&s;t &s;tolen."</P>
<P>"Nay, angry fair," rejoined the Faun, "but fir&s;t to my grot thou mu&s;t go!" And he &s;eized her round the wai&s;t.</P>
<P>She &s;creamed! and they were in&s;tantly &s;urrounded by a troop of bu&s;kined Nymphs; their long bows in their hands, and their &s;ilver quivers &s;u&s;pended by golden cords at their backs. "Wretch!" cried they, with one voice; and in&s;tantly an arrow was fixed in every bow.</P>
<P>"Ah! mu&s;t I die!" cried the Faun: "&s;tay till I &s;ing my death-&s;ong, and I will tell of the bow and arrows I &s;tole."</P>
<P>"Where are they?" eagerly interrupted the Nymph who had &s;lept.</P>
<P>"Among the bru&s;hwood, behind the bu&s;hes that &s;kirt yonder green alley."</P>
<P>She flew, and returned with them in her hand.</P>
<P>"We will hear your death-&s;ong," &s;aid the bu&s;kined train; "but fir&s;t we will bind you." Then, tying him to a tree, they a&s;&s;embled around, while thus the unfortunate Faun&mdash;</P>
<P>"Alas, thou mu&s;t die, haple&s;s Faun! Ah! Pity re|gards not thy youth! What grot was &s;o pretty as mine? What Faun half &s;o merry as I? At the door of my &s;weet little grot, how oft have I played on my flute; while Echo, &s;till pleas'd, told the tale, and the Nymphs all came trip|ping to hear! Each peeped from behind &s;ome green bu&s;h; but the Shepherds all flocked round my door, and led up a dance on the turf. When they were tired, I brought out my overflowing jug&mdash;"Come, drink, my lads!" I cried: they drank, and I filled it again and again.&mdash;But I mu&s;t die! I &s;hall fill my jug no more; no more &s;hall I play on my flute; my &s;weet, pretty grot I &s;hall never &s;ee again! Bury me, O ye Fauns, in my grot, with my flute and my jug by my &s;ide; and plant a young vine o'er my grave!</P>

<L>His jug, his flute, and, ah!&mdash;him&s;elf's no more!"</L>
<P>"Alas! haple&s;s Faun! thou mu&s;t die! but why at thy de&s;tiny grieve? Thy brother Fauns will envy thee &s;o &s;weet a death. To die by tho&s;e fair hands; to be &s;ur|rounded by &s;uch graceful forms, and gazed on by &s;uch bright eyes, makes death a ble&s;&s;ing. Cea&s;e to repine, fooli&s;h Faun! Ah! rather rejoice at thy fate&mdash;twine my brow, ye kind Fauns, when I'm dead, with tendrils cut fre&s;h from the vine. Ah! bury me then in my grot, and ro&s;es &s;trew over my grave.</P>
<L>There &s;h$ll each pa&s;&s;ing Sylvan turn to &s;ay&mdash;</L>
<L>"Here lies the Faun &s;o &s;weetly wont to play;</L>
<L>Echo, who lov'd his tuneful pipe &s;o well,</L>

<L>Sweet was his death; for, ah! by Nymphs he died,</L>
<L>The boa&s;t of beauty, and the fore&s;t's pride!"</L>
<P>He cea&s;ed!&mdash;when the Nymphs, partly moved to pity by his complaint, and partly flattered out of their re&s;ent|ment, throwing down their arrows, unbound him; and nimbly away ran the Faun to his grot.</P>
<L>There, on that flute, the pride of hill and dale,</L>
<L>He told of rapture &s;uch a thrilling tale,</L>
<L>That ev'ry Sylvan thought 'twas Pan who play'd,</L>
<L>And flock'd to meet him, joyous, thro' the glade;</L>

<HEAD>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE IMAGINATION.</HEAD>
<HEAD>AN ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<Q><L>True to the Seed the proper Flow'ret blows;</L>
<L>Plant not the Poppy, and expect the Ro&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>THERE is nothing, perhaps, more e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary to promote a regular cour&s;e of virtue, though few things are le&s;s attended to, than a due oeconomy of the Imagination. The mariner, who would reach the de&s;tined port, mu&s;t pay &s;trict attention to the helm; which, once abandoned to the mercy of the waves, he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily expect to be driven along by the impul&s;e of the &s;tream, da&s;hed on the rocks, or foundered on the &s;ands.</P>
<P>As beings depending on the practice of virtue for hap|pine&s;s, it is our duty to regulate our thoughts with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection; &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all that may appear in the &s;malle&s;t degree inimical to purity, and confining the excur&s;ive &s;peculations of fancy within the bounds of moderation. While we pre&s;erve this nece&s;&s;ary guard, our actions will rarely prove gro&s;sly evil; for he who is time|rous of thinking weakly, will &s;eldom have the temerity to act viciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>It is a forcible argument in favour of this temperament of the mind, that it proves an excellent preventive again&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="16">
many evils and di&s;appointments in life, the origin of which is more properly a&s;cribable to an irregular imagi|nation than to any other cau&s;e whatever. The folly of in|dulging what is termed Ca&s;tle-Building, has been ince&s;|&s;antly expo&s;ed: it is the hereditary di&s;ea&s;e of Hope, our in&s;eparable and flattering companion; and, having once taken root in our mental &s;oil, is &s;carcely ever entirely era|dicated. The only &s;ucce&s;s, therefore, that probability can en&s;ure to tho&s;e who make it's reprobation their employ, is the practicability of regulating it's progre&s;s: and, per|haps, Rea&s;on will not admit of more; as, in a certain degree, when directed towards objects and ends that have innocence for their &s;anction, it may not be totally repre|hen&s;ible; for the mind being a volatile &s;pirit, ince&s;&s;antly employed, and the frailty of nature not allowing it to be always engaged in the contemplation of piety, or the re|&s;earches of wi&s;dom; during the &s;ea&s;ons of it's inappetency towards &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, this entertainment will be found the be&s;t &s;ub&s;titute, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a capability of lifting it above grovelling views, and frequently in&s;piring it with laudable de&s;ires.</P>
<P>In the Golden Age, <HI>Imagination,</HI> the offspring of the gods, cho&s;e her dwelling among men. She had been educated by <HI>Wi&s;dom;</HI> her companions were <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Truth;</HI> and her engaging manner &s;o charmed all the world, that, next to the wor&s;hip of the Supreme Power, &s;he was the chief object of adoration, and ruled implicitly over the earth. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the faculty of tran&s;porting her followers wherever &s;he plea&s;ed, and exalting them to any &s;ituation: &s;he attended them through the &s;pring be|decked meads of primitive friend&s;hip, and conducted them to the amaranthine bowers of coele&s;tial love; but, in all her excur&s;ions, her two companions were continually at her &s;ide. She frequently elevated men to the &s;ynod of Heaven; in&s;tructed them in new mediums of adoration towards their original &s;ource, and continually urged them to the practice of what &s;he taught. In &s;hort, her whole time and power were employed in making men good and happy; and directing them to the mo&s;t con&s;ummate en|joyment of the exuberant bounties of an indulgent and watchful Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
When the Golden Age departed, and men became cor|rupt, &s;he &s;till continued among them, and endeavoured to allure them back to tho&s;e virtuous pur&s;uits they had almo&s;t univer&s;ally for&s;aken. Her efforts, however, proved ge|nerally inefficacious, through the intrigues of a Phantom, who now fir&s;t made her appearance. She was the daughter of <HI>Folly;</HI> her in&s;tructor was <HI>Error;</HI> and &s;he, al&s;o, had obtained the name of <HI>Imagination:</HI> but I &s;hall take the liberty to term her <HI>Fancy;</HI> an appellation which may con|vey a better idea of levity, her ruling di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;es of Fancy were always recommended by &s;ome promi&s;ed good; they abounded with artificial graces; were addre&s;&s;ed &s;olely to the pa&s;&s;ions; and, by an in&s;inu|ating charm of delicate flattery which imperceptibly ran through them, never failed making a permanent impre&s;|&s;ion on the minds and hearts of her deluded auditors.</P>
<P>By pre&s;enting every thing in an improper light, &s;he &s;o blended Virtue and Vice, that mankind were infatuated with the novelty of the &s;y&s;tem; and, as they found them|&s;elves capable of containing the <HI>acm&egrave;</HI> of excellence it re|quired, without the mortification of re&s;traint, were readily made converts to it's principles, and afterwards bigots to it's practice.</P>
<P><HI>Fancy</HI> had &s;everal daughters, the children of <HI>Indolence, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Di&s;content, Scepti&s;ci&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Pride.</HI> The&s;e &s;educed men to bowers mo&s;t inviting to the &s;en&s;es, and lulled them into the profounde&s;t &s;ecurity on the downy lap of enfeebling plea&s;ures; led them through woods and wilds, over lawns and meads, to &s;hades and grots, by purling rills, and mu&s;ical ca&s;cades; where the free, great, and daring hand of Romance, had habited Nature in the gari&s;h ve&s;tments of art, and expo&s;ed her to the caprice of Folly, and the pity of Rea&s;on; where &s;hepherds, &s;ighing to the wanton breeze, piped off with amorous lays the u&s;ele&s;s hour, or irritated time with puerile complaints; where peerle&s;s prince&s;&s;es rode forth in all the pride of virtue, and tyranny of beauty, amid ranks of adoring knights, whom Folly taught the roundelay of love, each &s;carcely deigning to notice her devoted &s;lave, till he had de&s;troyed one of the horrifick mon&s;ters borne by <HI>Credulity</HI> to <HI>Im|po&s;ition;</HI> and made all other knights tremble at his name; when &s;allied forth the harne&s;&s;ed chief, in mad defiance of
<PB N="18" REF="18">
all the collected &s;torms of angry heaven, at war with ea&s;e, infatuated by chimaeras, and braving de&s;truction, for the mighty recompence of &s;miles: conveyed them where, with undu$ating dance, the graceful Naiades tripped over floors of gold; or where, maje&s;tick, in their coral groves, the Neriedes dre&s;&s;ed their tre&s;&s;es with the pearl; where pla&s;tick Nature, in her rich rece&s;s, compo&s;ed the ductile ore, and beauteous gem; traced too her every plan, and taught the wondrous &s;cience of her law.</P>
<P>But the effect, through the devices of their conductors, was &s;till either an in&s;atiable de&s;ire after what the eye had contemplated, or an imperious inflation on account of the &s;tores the mind had injudiciou&s;ly heaped together; thus all the gifts be&s;towed, or pro&s;pects pre&s;ented, by <HI>Fancy</HI> and her offspring, proved every way pernicious, and totally diverted men from the few principles of virtue remaining among them.</P>
<P><HI>Imagination</HI> had al&s;o attended her votaries through nearly the &s;ame routine of enjoyments; but, while &s;he exhibited their charms, dive&s;ted them of the power to u&s;urp the government of Rea&s;on, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Truth, Purity, Gratitude,</HI> and <HI>Benevolence;</HI> which la&s;t had joined her at the departure of the Golden Age. Her opponents, in the mean time, were aided by <HI>Error, In|continence, Sophi&s;try,</HI> and <HI>Self-Love.</HI> Unfortunately, however, &s;he di&s;covered that the allurements of her ene|mies had drawn mo&s;t of her followers away: therefore, after reiterated offers of her advice and benefits, which were uniformly di&s;regarded; and, having wearied her&s;elf ineffectually for their advantage, hurt by their neglect, and &s;candalized by their perver&s;ene&s;s, &s;he retired, at length, to the Temple of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> in the regions of <HI>Vir|tue;</HI> determined to be conver&s;ed with only through the de&s;ire of <HI>Truth,</HI> the &s;anction of <HI>Purity,</HI> and the recom|mendation of <HI>Benevolence.</HI></P>

<P>"ALL is vanity!" exclaimed a venerable man, who&s;e cheeks were furrowed more by grief than age, as he reclined again&s;t a tomb&s;tone, in the church-yard of

one of our principal bathing towns. The &s;ituation was intere&s;ting! The church on a hill; the night hazy; though the moon reflected &s;ufficient light to give him a general view of the pro&s;pect around; the &s;ea, at a di&s;|tance, on his right-hand, neither tempe&s;tuous nor calm, wa&s;hed the beach with it's waves. He had long li&s;tened to it's murmuring, his eye fixed &s;tedfa&s;tly on the &s;culptured memento of mortality which &s;upported him; there was a congeniality between it's di&s;ordered &s;tate, and that of his own bo&s;om, which forcibly &s;truck him; and, amid the reflections it occa&s;ioned, &s;urveying fir&s;t the town before him, and then the race ground on his left-hand&mdash;where, &s;o recently, he had witne&s;&s;ed the exertions of Indu&s;try in the one, and the extravagances of Fa&s;hion at the other&mdash;his eye in&s;en&s;ibly reverting to the tomb&s;tone, he in&s;tinc|tively expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf&mdash;"All is vanity!"</P>
<P>The night rather clearing, induced him to walk far|ther; he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;pot where the encampment had been. War, and it's in&s;eparable horrors&mdash;the death of the brave, the di&s;traction of the widow, the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of the or|phan, the de&s;olation of towns, and the de&s;truction of empires&mdash;afforded him ample &s;cope for rumination; till, uncon&s;cious of his way, he entered another church-yard, about a mile from that he had left. The church was an|cient; and, though &s;ervice was regularly performed there, in ruins. Alas! to what purpo&s;es may not the mo&s;t e&s;ti|mable things be degraded! one part of the &s;acred build|ing had been converted into a farriery for the camp; but, ere this, the &s;ons of Labour had abandoned it. All was &s;ilent! It was a &s;cene to be contemplated only with hor|ror; except by tho&s;e whom Religion had fortified again&s;t &s;uper&s;titious prejudice, or Inquietude alienated from habits of chearfulne&s;s. The walls of the church-yard were low, mouldering, and in many places &s;urmounted by the weeds that grew up again&s;t them; the graves, unornamented by the tablets of &s;epultural information, were only to be di&s;|criminated by the verdant hillocks which the humble &s;ex|ton had elevated with decent pride.</P>
<P>He looked around him, with a &s;ort of gloomy &s;erenity, for &s;ome time; when an object lying on one of the graves attracted his earne&s;t notice. He approached it, and &s;tarted, on removing a coar&s;e but clean covering, at beholding

In an in&s;tant, his fight was arre&s;ted by an $mac$ated female, who&s;e wild looks &s;ufficiently indicated the di&s;order of her mind; and who, &s;p$$nging from behind the church, ran &s;wiftly to him, and dropping on her knees, in a p$ercing tone of voice, cried&mdash;"O, don't take him from me!" Then, overcome by agitation, immediately fainted.

<P>"What know ye of this young woman?" eagerly en|quired the almo&s;t petrified father.</P>
<P>"She lived with us," replied the man, "about three months: her hu&s;band, who was a &s;oldier, died of a fever in camp, and lies buried in that grave; his death turned her brain, and &s;he often u$$d to &s;ay&mdash;"<HI>She would put her child to bed with his father."</HI> Here the unhappy lunatick &s;ighed; opened her eyes; and, fixing them &s;tedia&s;tly on her &s;upporter, in a moment of recollection, &s;creamed&mdash;"My father! pray, pray, forgive me!"

<P>THE di&s;couragement of Genius has long been the hackneyed topick of general remark; to the detri|ment of Literature, the reproach of Rea&s;on, and the &s;can|dal of Humanity; as it &s;eems peculiarly hard and unac|countable, that tho&s;e who contribute chiefly to the means of delight and improvement to mankind, &s;hould find their labours alone productive of the frowns of Ingratitude: and there is little doubt to be entertained, but that the im|petious dogmas of contracted Prejudice have deteried many whom the early emanations of &s;trong natural endowments have palpably di&s;tingui&s;hed as eligible candidates for the
<PB N="24" REF="24">
laurels of immortal Fame, from a&s;&s;erting their preten&s;ions; and induced them to conceal their talents in a napkin, through the exaggerated predictions of an injudicious prudence, and the inglorious apprehen&s;ions of a puerile de|&s;pair. In ju&s;tice to &s;ociety at large, and for the benefit of tho&s;e individually concerned, it were, perhaps, highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enquire into the merits of an ob&s;ervation, &s;o univer&s;ally propagated, and implicitly believed: and though the attempt of invalidating any general opinion, authorized by long e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the corroboration of apparently incontrovertible evidence, may carry with it a &s;trong pre&s;umption of effrontery and conceit; yet, when rea&s;on gives the &s;malle&s;t &s;anction to the &s;urmize of doubt, it is both folly and inju&s;tice to depre&s;s the &s;pirit of candid enquiry, through a &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the fea|tures of antiquity, or a &s;ervile acquie&s;cence in the tyranny of cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The idea of the <HI>di&s;couragement of genius</HI> ari&s;es princi|pally, I imagine, from the remarkable indigence of au|thors in general; which, on examination, I am inclined to believe, will be found, for the mo&s;t part, to originate in cau&s;es perfectly remote. On tracing the biography of literature, we &s;hall di&s;cover many examples of men of the fir&s;t repute continually &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s, and frequently dying in extreme indigence; yet we &s;hall like|wi&s;e find, that the majority of tho&s;e very men were univer|&s;ally care&s;&s;ed while living, and their memories, after death, immortalized by the honourable te&s;timonies of an enthu&s;i|a&s;tick fame. It remains, then, to enquire into the cau&s;e of tho&s;e difficulties; and they will not, perhaps, turn out &s;o hard to be otherwi&s;e accounted for, as we might at fir&s;t imagine.</P>
<P>A delicate &s;en&s;ibility, a jealous independence of &s;pirit, and an active liberality of &s;entiment, are the almo&s;t un|exceptionable concomitants of an enlightened mind; and a &s;trongly marked excentricity of character, is generally the deci&s;ive criterion of an uncommon genius. From the&s;e &s;tamina, together with that total inattention to in|di&s;pen&s;ible oeconomy, cor&s;picuous in the annals of &s;ome; and that egregious credulity equally &s;o in tho&s;e of others; may, I conceive. be deduced the complicated mi&s;carriages which have &s;o often involved the fortunes of many, who&s;e pages, &s;uperior to critici&s;m, have long defied the in&s;idious

Thus, through the bias of ex|treme &s;u&s;ceptibility, &s;o great an influence is obtained, as to render an act of relief nece&s;&s;ary, in order to obviate the poignancy of the impre&s;&s;ion. Hence many are &s;educed into the incon&s;iderate mea&s;ure of be&s;towing that which their own exigencies ab&s;olutely require, before reflection re|pre&s;ents to them the nature of the action, as to propriety, whether of the rea&s;on on the one hand, or charity on the other. Neverthele&s;s, in &s;pite of the various pecuniary &s;traits accruing from this or any other cau&s;e, the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a delicate and capacious mind, &s;en&s;ible of his intellectual &s;uperiority; a&s;hamed to give the ignorant and in&s;olent occa&s;ion to triumph, by a confe&s;&s;ion of his weakne&s;s; and di&s;daining to &s;ubject him&s;elf to the ap|prehen&s;ion of &s;tudied neglect or contumelious reproach, through the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of obligation, will rather &s;ubmit to the e&s;urine power of accumulating embarra&s;&s;ment, than betray his &s;olly, by an appearance of decrea&s;ing fortune; till, hourly be&s;et by the grating importunities of clamorous creditors, and want &s;taring him in the face, he either flies to hide his di&s;grace in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner, a melancholy prey to di&s;gu&s;t and famine; or oppre&s;&s;ed to an extreme by the idea of his inability to di&s;charge the claims of ju&s;tice, and retrieve his honour, incapable either of re&s;i&s;tance or flight, gives way to de&s;pondency, and &s;inks under the overwhelming ruin!</P>
<P>Men of &s;trong genius, principally, if not generally, have &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions; and hence, too, the gratification of the predominant affection frequently ab&s;orbs the mind &s;o much, that every thing is &s;acrificed to it; e&s;pecially where the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the imagination is not tempered by the active energy of Virtue: whence ari&s;es the glaring occa&s;ion of neglect towards them&s;elves, and of &s;candal again&s;t lite|rature from the multitude; who, taught to look up to them as teachers, and of cour&s;e &s;tandards of rectitude, on di&s;covering they are equally weak with them&s;elves, mu&s;t naturally turn away di&s;gu&s;ted, and treat with con|tempt

the means whereby they propo&s;e the attainment of that excellence, which their own examples &s;eem to convey a &s;trong pre&s;umption can exi&s;t alone in idea.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the foregoing ob&s;ervations, many indu|bitable te&s;timonies might be produced; but, to enter into &s;o thorough an inve&s;tigation, would too far exceed the contracted limits of a &s;ummary e&s;&s;ay: yet it will not, per|haps, be deemed &s;uperfluous, in adverting to a deplorable circum&s;tance yet fre&s;h in the minds of many, and which has &s;erved greatly to promote the acknowledgment of the object of our pre&s;ent animadver&s;ion; I mean, the untimely fate of that uncommon in&s;tance of promi&s;ing genius, and &s;elf-devoted victim, <HI>Chatterton!</HI> In contemplating, how|ever, this extraordinary character, and the circum&s;tances of his ca&s;e&mdash;though, with regard to the former, we &s;hall find much to pity, &s;till we &s;hall di&s;cover &s;omething to condemn; and, in relation to the latter, there will, I am per&s;uaded, appear &s;ufficient cau&s;e for the exculpation of &s;ociety at large from the &s;trong imputations of unju&s;t neglect, and barbarous de&s;ertion. It may be recollected, that Chatterton was &s;o little known, that when Fame fir&s;t introduced his name and elogium to the world, &s;he faul|tered during the recital, to $eave a ligh to his memory, and drop a tear over his end! Nor was it likely he &s;hould be otherwi&s;e: born in ob&s;curity; far from the metropolis, the nur&s;ery of genius; and connected only with a few in|dividuals, who wanted either the ability to di&s;cern his me|rit, or to fo&s;ter it by the influence of patronage; he had &s;carcely any other pro&s;pect, at his out&s;et, in the language of the elegantly pathetick Gray, than&mdash;</P>
<P>"To wa&s;te <HI>his</HI> &s;weetne&s;s in the de&s;art air!"</P>
<P>Nor was that pro&s;pect improved when he entered London; a mere boy, without friends, money, or recommenda|tion; with a volume of poems, <HI>profe&s;&s;edly</HI> not his own, and compo&s;ed in a dialect too ob&s;olete for generaly concep|tion. The&s;e poems were retailed to the world through the channel of a common Magazine, and under the fictitious &s;ignature of the Prie&s;t Rowley; who was adverti&s;ed as living at &s;o great a period as three centuries back: and the venders of them, conver&s;ant, probably, only with the <HI>traffick</HI> of literature, conceiving they were what he repre|&s;ented

them, and uncertain what reception they would ex|perience from their readers, might think a trifling reward &s;ufficient for the communication of a &s;peculative adven|ture; while the publick read them with a tacit approbation of their merit, but little concerned about an author whom they &s;uppo&s;ed had long been relieved from the effect of human &s;olicitudes. But as the &s;un, though fogs ob&s;cure it's ri&s;ing, &s;oon di&s;&s;ipates every intervening &s;hade; &s;o the brilliant emanations of &s;terling genius rerely &s;ubmit long to concealment. The poems of Rowley, at length, attracted the earne&s;t attention of the di&s;cerning; and an enquiry af|ter the author was the natural con&s;equence: the annals of ancient lierature, however, could afford no &s;atisfactory information; and a minute critique evinced that the pre|tended manu&s;cript of ages was of modern date. Curio&s;ity was now impatient for the knowledge of the real &s;abri|cator of &s;o wonderful a performance; and conjecture rea|&s;onably imputed the charge to the affected editor, Chat|terton: the &s;u&s;picion was confirmed; &s;earch was made for him, in order to reward &s;uch merit as it de&s;erved; and that &s;earch was interrupted by the confounding intelli|gence that he was&mdash;no more! Never, perhaps, was there a mind more actuated by the rigid &s;pirit of independence, than that of this Parna&s;&s;ian prodigy; hence it was he cho&s;e, rather than confe&s;s his embarra&s;tment, to ruminate in the chamber of want, over the gloomy pro&s;pects of mi&s;ery, till di&s;gu&s;t and horror, &s;upplanting rea&s;on, precipitated him into the gulph of &s;uicide; at an age when many of the mo&s;t eminent examples of brilliant talents have di&s;clo&s;ed little more than the mere dawning of excellence, and in the moment when Fame was preparing to tran&s;port him to the temple of Munificence!</P>
<P>Such are the principle features of an event, which will long be ju&s;tly a &s;ubject of the &s;incere&s;t regret; but which, I pre&s;ume, can never rea&s;onably ju&s;tify the imputation thence incurred by &s;ociety. Yet, let it not be inferred from this exculpatory effort, that I would &s;eek to add to the &s;everity of Chatterton's fate, by ungenerous reflections on his memory&mdash;No! I di&s;claim an act, the bare idea of which excites in my mind the mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ations of in|dignant horror. I have, for a moment, removed the veil which Charity had drawn over his de&s;pair; but, &s;urely,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
humanity it&s;elf will ju&s;tify a deed prompted by nece&s;&s;ity, for the advancement of univer&s;al equity.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource whence we $Word$ the prejudice in que&s;|tion, is the re$ction of the many who, either inflated by conceit, or mi$led by $nthu&s;ia&s;m, without the attributes of genius, lay claim to it's rewards. I $$e genius is not more valuable than rare; and, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a diffidence that frequently $et$rds it's progre&s;s in no &s;ma$l degree, by interpreting the flights of ignorance into the facit condemna$ion of delicacy; and from the fate of cor|rected $eme$ity, approp$i$ting to it&s;elf $Word$ equally ground|le&s;s and hum$$sting: thence it's bold flights are repre&s;$ed, it's energy relaxes, and it's &s;ublime $Word$, rarely in|&s;pired by hope, are frequently allowed to evaporate un|known.</P>
<P>But he who &s;uffers his mind to be thus affected, &s;hould recollect, that all extremes are $$$ally reprehen&s;ible; that every natural edifice can only by regular gradations be brought to perfection; that temporal $Word$ are always liable to delay; and that, in eve$$ &s;tate &s;hort of ab&s;olute certa$$$, &s;ucces will not always be proportionate to the end a$our, and ra$$ly to the hope. $rom patient per$$|verence much is to be expected, and from timid i$re&s;olu|tion every thing is to be feared: to effect enterprizes evi|dently beyond our &s;trength, is ab&s;u$d; but to f$$$, merely through the want of exertion, is inglorious. Any thig, to be publickly protected, mu&s;t $Word$ be fir&s;t pub|lickly known; thence the efforts of $Word$ mu&s;t be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e of indu&s;try, and they hope of approbation by the means to de$erve it: and though the power of in|tere&s;t, the b$as of popularity, the c$p$ice of fa&s;hion, or the $Word$ of $Span$, may a while &s;up|port the &s;$$m&s;y productions of fal&s;e ment; like the v$|grant feather $Word$ on the breeze, or the $amely-tin$$d flower forced $$to being though the unnatural medium of a hot-hou&s;e, they &s;hall &s;oon return to their primitive nothingne&s;s as, of their emblems, the one falls again to the ground when the breeze &s;ub$$d$s; and the other withers away, before the curio&s;ity that rai&s;ed it is compleatly grati|fied; while the &s;trong emanations of genius, like the tower|ing column, and the &s;preading oak, the gradual perfor|mances of nature and &s;cience, will &s;tand con&s;picuous ob|jects
<PB N="29" REF="29">
of admiration and benefit to the world, when many rea&s;ons &s;hall have revolved, and many generations have pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>The belief of this accu&s;ation is al&s;o &s;trengthened by the too &s;anguine expectation of many po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genius, as to the returns both of emolument and honour: but, per|haps, this is only the ca&s;e with tho&s;e gi$ted with only a partial di&s;tribution of this ine&s;t$$able quality; who, like birds newly fledged, can attempt no flight of con&s;equence, without having continual recour&s;e to intervening objects of &s;upport, in order to recruit their &s;trength. But &s;uch &s;hould reflect, that the laws of ju&s;tice require no more than "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a $ooth;" in con|&s;equence, if they are capable of pre&s;enting but a trifling portion of original matter, it were unrea&s;onable to expect a large rever$ion, either of prai&s;e or profit: and, relative to the latter, authors, doubtle&s;s, as well as the re&s;t of man|kind, form their e&s;timate, more on the lucre of &s;uperfluous gratifications, than rea&s;onable nece&s;&s;ity; but they would do well to con&s;ider, that the harmony of the e&s;tabli&s;hments of Nature depends on an invariable exactitude of con&s;titu|tional oeconomy; the &s;pirit of which pervades every branch of &s;ociety; hence the general calculations of di&s;tribution, rej$$ting the accumulated claims of chim$$$cal &s;peculation; will, of nece&s;&s;ity be proportioned only to the equitable exi|gencies of temperance.</P>
<P>I have thus, as far as brevity permits, endeavoured, I hope not in vain, by pomting out the fallacy of a remark which I conceive highly detrimental, to divert it's perni|cious influence: for, as the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable talents are given with a reference to univer&s;al benefit, and as &s;o much is to be expected from tho&s;e calculated to improve both the mind and the heart; it is, of cour&s;e, incumbent on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them to devote as much time as rea&s;on will allow in directing them to that end. It is, in the mean time, the duty and intere&s;t of all, indi&s;ciminately, to oppo&s;e, &s;o far as they are able, every ob&s;truction that pre|&s;ents it&s;elf; and, perhaps, it were not unnece&s;&s;ary to con|clude, with recommending the children of Genius to re&s;cue their hopes from the pangs of di&s;appointment, by placing little dependence, for &s;ub&s;tantial emolument, on the fruits of their lucubrations, till the thorough inve&s;tigation of

Candour, and the indubitable te&s;timony of Time, &s;hall have decided on the legality of their preten&s;ions; nor ever to expect, that a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t brilliant talents can ju&s;tify flagitious irregularity; or that &s;ociety is obli|gated, on any pretence whatever, to relieve the endle&s;s de|ficiences of premeditated extravagance, or to comply with the inordinate demands of unprincipled de&s;ire; as al&s;o that he who toils merely for the indulgence of unwarrant|able pa&s;&s;ions, defeats, in the end, his own views: for, as by every new indulgence they obtain fre&s;h influence over him, debilitating his under&s;tanding, they renders him proportionately le&s;s capable to provide for it's wants; while he, who&s;e de&s;ires are moderate, finds his ability in|crea&s;ed by his temperance, and &s;ecures to him&s;elf a flatter|ing pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure and independence.</P>

<P>AFTER retiring from a very di&s;agreeable in&s;tance of that di&s;gu&s;ting ab&s;urdity, AFFECTATION, I fell into a profound rever$e on it's nature and o$$gm; revolving in my mind various methods which I thought might be efficaciou&s;ly practi&s;ed in reforming many of it's abettors, whom I divided into two cla&s;&s;es; viz. the <HI>moderate,</HI> or &s;uch as were but &s;lightly di&s;ordered, of cour&s;e ea&s;ily re|claimed; and the <HI>hopeful,</HI> or &s;uch as were far gone, but who&s;e recovery was practicable from the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame not being entirely bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>While indulging my&s;elf with the&s;e &s;peculations, I in|&s;en&s;ibly arrived at a large plain, in the mid&s;t of which
<PB N="35" REF="35">
$tood a temple &s;o brilliantly magnificent, that for &s;ome time I could not &s;upport the &s;ight without embarra&s;&s;ment: an immen&s;e number of people, of all ages and de&s;criptions, were flocking to it, with whom I mingled; when a grave per&s;onage, who cal$ed him&s;elf <HI>Di&s;cernment,</HI> informed me, that it was the <HI>Temple of Excellence,</HI> and that the multitude were repairing thither to pay their homage to the cele&s;tial power.</P>
<P>On our arrival at the gate, we were met by a beauti|ful female, habited in a plain ve&s;t: her countenance was remarkably &s;erene; and her demeanor, with the property of commanding, united &s;uch engaging graces as pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every one in her favour. <HI>Rea&s;on&mdash;</HI>for that was her name&mdash;pre&s;ented a mirior to every one's face as they approached, in order to examine the &s;incerity of their pro|fe&s;&s;ions, and di&s;cover the real nature of their inclinations; when &s;uch as were confu&s;ed by the e&s;ilux of light that proceeded from it, were de$med not &s;ufficiently pure, and con&s;equently were refu&s;ed admittance.</P>
<P>I was expre&s;&s;ing my apprehen&s;ions for the fate of tho&s;e unfortunate numbers; when a nymph, who&s;e eyes in|ce&s;&s;antly rolled about, and were prying into every thing, invited me to follow and ob&s;erve them. Her &s;olicitations were &s;econded by another, of a mo&s;t alluting form and manner: &s;o that, fearing no danger from two &s;uch appa|rently inoffen&s;ive creatures, I con&s;ented to accompany them, contrary to the entreaties of my fir&s;t companion; who, however, at parting, gave me a magnifying-gla&s;s of extrordinary virtue, through which &s;he de&s;ired me to view the &s;everal objects I &s;hould meet with.</P>
<P>My fair guides conducted me down a deep de&s;cent on the left-&s;ide of the temple; and I ob&s;erved, that the cap|tivating power of her who acco&s;ted me la&s;t, in&s;tigated &s;everal of tho&s;e who had already entered, and from whence they beheld her through an opening on that &s;ide of the building, to for&s;ake it and follow her.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the hill we entered a labyrinth, &s;o artfully contrived, that we could not find our way out. While exerting our&s;elves to that purpo&s;e, we were ad|dre&s;&s;ed by another female of very gaudy appearance; who informed us that the maze was her's, and offered her &s;ervices in extricating us. We readily acceded to her propo&s;al;
<PB N="36" REF="36">
and &s;he led us into a large garden, laid out in a &s;trangely incon&s;i&s;tent manner.</P>
<P>I now, for the fir&s;t time, applied to my gla&s;s; and di&s;covered $Word$ our guide, though to the naked eye &s;he appeared in extraordinary beauty, &s;quinted immoderately, and was in every $Word$ extremely $Word$. I ob&s;erved, to$, that the vo$aciou&s;ly devoured what the $e&s;t thought delicious $$$ts; but which, to me, te$rned poi&s;onous $Word$. By $$$e circum&s;tances, I concluded her to be <HI>Fal&s;e T$&s;ie.</HI> She was co$tinually di&s;tributing her noxious v$ands among the company, encouraging them to f$llow her ex|ample: but, apprel e$$ing &s;ome banefol con&s;equences from them, I dropped my &s;ha$e &s;ecretly to the ground; and there|by e&s;caped an una$cunt$ble $Word$ of iradne&s;s, or intoxi|cation, which &s;eized a$ tho&s;e who had eaten, and impelled them into numberle&s;s extravagances, the more or le&s;s lice$ $Word$, in proportion to the quantity each had con|&s;umed I now &s;urveyed my two companions through my optical informer, the fir&s;t of whom, I found, was <HI>Curio&s;ity;</HI> and the other, who appeared a dangerous, yet beautiful &s;erpent, <HI>Seduction.</HI> I immediately turned from her with horror; but could not $id my&s;elf of <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> who &s;eemed determined not to leave me.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that during the intervals of the ex|ce&s;&s;es which I have noticed as the effects of the poi|&s;onous h$rbs, an extreme de&s;pondency and &s;olicitude were vi&s;ible in every countenance; which I imagined to be occa&s;ion $Word$ g$neral wi&s;h of returning to the <HI>Temple of Excellence,</HI> as <HI>Fal&s;e Tafle,</HI> having tried in vain totally to $Word$ it, offered to conduct them there. They joyfully $Word$, and again approached the labyrinth: but, in|&s;te$d of returning by the way we entered, I found &s;he $Word$ a diff$rent direction; till, at length, we emerged into a pla$n, in appearance like the former, and in the $Span$ &s;tood a temple which, to every eye but mine, &s;eemed that they hoped to arrive at. It's external &s;plen|dor, however, was derived from numerous &s;mall mirrors, which were diver&s;ified all over it, and &s;o placed as to re|flect on each other; and which, at the &s;un's ri&s;ing, pro|duced $$ fir&s;t an intolerable glare, but lo&s;t that effect as we appro$ched nearer.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="37">
Entering with the re&s;t, I beheld a female enthroned, amid&s;t a captivating appearance of grandeur and magnifi|cence; but the throne was covered only with gilt paper, and foils of various colours, artfully di&s;po&s;ed. The dre&s;s of the per&s;onage it &s;upported was of the &s;ame complexion, a compound of tin&s;el and fal&s;e jewels: her face was painted to an extreme; and her hair di&s;po&s;ed in ringlets, inter|mixed with artificial flowers and pearls, a wreath of which &s;erved her for a tiara. In &s;hort, ever&punc; thing was unnatural; from which circum&s;tance, and the &s;tudied demeanor of it's mi&s;tre&s;s, I became convinced it was the re&s;idence of AFFECTATION. All her attendants wore the garbs and appearance of tho&s;e belonging to <HI>Excellence;</HI> but I could plainly perceive in each the real character. It was <HI>So|phi&s;try</HI> who pre&s;ented, at the door, what was thought the mirror of <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> the libidinous leer of <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> betray|ed it&s;elf from under the arrogated veil of extreme <HI>Sanctity;</HI> the &s;elf-applauding &s;mile of <HI>O&s;tentation,</HI> appeared in the pretended benevolency of a&s;pect peculiar to <HI>Gener$&s;ity;</HI> and the con&s;equential air of pedantick <HI>Dulne&s;s,</HI> was con|&s;picuous in the apparent re&s;erve of <HI>Wi&s;dom:</HI> in a word, the leading features of every de&s;irable qualification were adopted by the oppo&s;ite dete&s;table ones.</P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly were now preparing to pay their adoration to the fal$s;e deity, when a violent bla&s;t from a trumpet a&s;&s;ailed our ears; the greate&s;t con&s;ternation took place; the queen and her e&s;tabli&s;hment trembled; and, with the temple, in a few moments di&s;appeared; leaving the deluded votaries expo&s;ed on the plain, which now pre|&s;ented a mi&s;erably barren appearance.</P>
<P>I &s;oon learned, that the cau&s;e of this circum&s;tance an|nounced the arrival of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Truth;</HI> who were di&s;|patched from the <HI>Temple of Excellence,</HI> to retrieve every one who &s;hould be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;malle&s;t veneration for that exalted being: they were attended by a numerous train, two or three of whom I &s;hall de&s;cribe, having oc|ca&s;ion to mention them hereafter. The fir&s;t was a gro|te&s;que figure, like a &s;atyr, called <HI>Ridicule:</HI> he had a whip, with which he &s;courged all given to his charge, till they were delivered by <HI>Shame,</HI> a female with a long veil; from whom they were &s;eized by <HI>Conviction,</HI> who darted a &s;ting into the brea&s;t, occa&s;ioning the &s;ufferers a mo&s;t acute pain,
<PB N="38" REF="38">
which was relieved by a &s;edate matron, called <HI>Repentance;</HI> and the objects of her care were conducted to <HI>Clemency,</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful female I ever beheld, who&s;e province it was to introduce them to <HI>Excellence.</HI></P>
<P>A herald now &s;ummoned the multitude before the throne of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Truth. Rea&s;on</HI> pre&s;ented another mirror to each, individually, in which all were to behold them&s;elves; and were they appeared with the counte|nances of &s;uch different &s;pecies of the brute creation as the di&s;po&s;ition in each might mo&s;t re&s;emble.</P>
<P>Some, on thus beholding them&s;elves, blu&s;hed wonder|fully, and were perfectly aba&s;hed: the&s;e, I concluded, were <HI>moderates.</HI> They were delivered to <HI>Shame,</HI> fir&s;t, and, in due cour&s;e, to <HI>Clemency.</HI> Others, whom I found were <HI>hopefuls,</HI> &s;eemed &s;carcely at all affected: but, as the &s;malle&s;t blu&s;h en|titled them to pardon, they were fir&s;t given to <HI>Ridicule;</HI> and, in the proper routine, to <HI>Clemency.</HI> Some of the&s;e, how|ever, &s;urveyed their altered countenances a con&s;iderable time, before the fainte&s;t glow could be perceived on their cheeks: the&s;e were con&s;igned over to a &s;upercilious being, called <HI>Contempt;</HI> who, clapping a fool's cap and bells on their heads, drove them about, through the laughter and deri&s;ions of the whole company, till <HI>Shame</HI> thought pro|per to take cognizance of them.</P>
<P>There were, however, a great number of <HI>incurables;</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e who were allured from the temple by <HI>Seduction:</HI> the&s;e had devoured &s;o many of the weeds given them by <HI>Fal&s;e Ta&s;te,</HI> and were grown &s;o extremely gro&s;s, as to be enamoured of their bea&s;tly appearance in the mirror. <HI>Truth</HI> inmediately touched them with her wand; and they were, in con&s;equence, metamorpho&s;ed into the various creatures who repre&s;ented them: thus, fal&s;e <HI>Lovers</HI> took the forms of <HI>goats</HI> and <HI>byaenas;</HI> fal&s;e <HI>Heroes, hares;</HI> fal&s;e <HI>Orators, a&s;&s;es,</HI> dinning the whole place with their brayings; and <HI>fal&s;e Criticks, owls,</HI> di&s;turbing &s;ociety with their &s;en&s;ele&s;s hoorings in the dark, yet utterly incapable of bearing the &s;malle&s;t degree of refulgence. Tho&s;e who affected <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> and <HI>independence,</HI> were turned into <HI>&s;paniels; religious Hypocrites,</HI> into <HI>wolves;</HI> fal&s;e <HI>Patriots,</HI> into <HI>crocodiles;</HI> and fal&s;e <HI>Wits,</HI> into <HI>monkies&punc;</HI> till the plain pre&s;ented a &s;cence at once horrid, ludricous, and de|plorable.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39">
At length, it came to my turn; but the figure I cut in the mirror, from having &s;inned with open eyes, con|founded me &s;o much, that I &s;wooned away, and the vi&s;ion vani&s;hed!</P>

<HEAD>FANATICISM AND INFIDELITY; OR, THE PSEUDO-REFORMERS.</HEAD>
<P>FANATICISM and INFIDELITY&mdash;this bred at court, and that in a cloi&s;ter&mdash;&s;et out together on a no le&s;s charitable expedition than to reform the world: the one thinking that mankind defrauded them&s;elves of happine&s;s, by a ridiculous attachment to unrea&s;onable &s;crupulo&s;ity; and the other, that they endangered their &s;alvation by a too familiar compact with licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Their manner of travelling was as oppo&s;ite as their characters. FANATICISM, barefooted, and with &s;carcely a coat to his back; tru&s;ting to charity for &s;upport, trudged heavily on; groaning all the way, and offering up expi|atory ejaculations to Heaven: while INFIDELITY, &s;up|plied with a good round &s;um, and mounted on an ea&s;y pad, that his companion might the better keep pace with him, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with a brandy bottle, or &s;inging licentious ballads; and, whenever they &s;topped to dine, the zealot made &s;o long a grace, that, before he &s;at down to his cru&s;t and water, his rival had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the de&s;&s;ert, and began his bottle.</P>
<P>On their arrival at any town, they immediately repaired to the market, or &s;ome other con&s;picuous place; and each mounting on &s;ome elevated &s;pot, at proper di&s;tances, be|gan their harangues; while the mob flocked tumultuou&s;ly around, gaping with the mo&s;t anxious curio&s;ity. The text of FANATICISM was from Saint Paul&mdash;"<HI>Now the end of the&s;e things is death!"</HI> That of INFIDELITY, from Anacreon&mdash;"<HI>Laugh and grow fat!"</HI> The di&s;cour&s;e of the fir&s;t abounded &s;o much with the mo&s;t rigorous injunc|tions
<PB N="40" REF="40">
to the ob&s;ervance of &s;elf-denial, ab&s;tinence, and mortification, that it was reli&s;hed only by &s;uch of his auditors as di&s;appointment had rendered &s;plenetick; impo|tence cha&s;te; age imbecile; or di&s;ea&s;e ab&s;temious: and he thundered away &s;o tremendou&s;ly, with hell, damnation, and the unpardonable &s;in, that the greater part were ter|rified almo&s;t out of their wits; thinking&mdash;ignorant of it's nature&mdash;that they had undoubtedly committed the latter, and were con&s;equently, without hope of redemption, con|&s;igned to the former. Concluding, therefore, all attempts at repentance in vain, they went over to the oppo&s;ition; or, in other words, joined the congregation of INFI|DELITY; who told them, that his fellow-traveller was a poor unhappy lunatick di&s;carded from Bedlam, as incur|able; which a&s;&s;ertion the very doctrine he held forth would &s;ufficiently corroborate. He maintained that all re&s;traint was unnatural, and that what was unnatural mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be unju&s;t; that the pre&s;ent we were cer|tain of, but the future we knew nothing about; "that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bu&s;h;" and, con|&s;equently, that wi&s;dom directed us to the enjoyment of that which was in our power. He concluded with inviting them to the next tavern; where they &s;tupified them&s;elves with drinking, "<HI>Succe&s;s to the New Light;"</HI> and, as their pa&s;tor generally &s;lipped &s;lily away, after picking their pockets, they were mo&s;tly, for the lack of reckoning, placed in the &s;tocks, or other "durance vile," huzzaing for the freedom of Nature!</P>
<P>During the intervals between their &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons of preaching, FANATICISM would either &s;it, literally, in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes; or walk to and fro in the town, re|prehending the &s;malle&s;t appearance of merriment: while INFIDELITY drank, gamed, wenched, and committed numberle&s;s exce&s;&s;es; all of which he reconciled, on the principles of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> the former, he ob&s;erved, having given us appetites, the latter required them to be gratified. He &s;educed his friend's wife, and di&s;patched the hu&s;band in a duel for que&s;tioning his honour. At length, being apprehended for a highway robbery, he defended him&s;elf with the old argument, the <HI>Laws of Nature and Rea&s;on:</HI> as by tho&s;e, he contended, we were all on a &s;tate of equality; &s;o, by the&s;e, the nece&s;&s;ities of
<PB N="41" REF="41">
one &s;hould be &s;upplied from the &s;uperfluities of another; and, when a rich man would not voluntarily do ju&s;tice, force was allowable to compel him. It was argued in reply, that he was tried neither by the law of Nature, nor of Rea&s;on, but by the law of the land. This ob&s;erva|tion, however, was violently reprobated, as it &s;eemed to imply, that the law of the land was neither natural nor rea&s;onable. A large labyrinth of controver&s;y now en|&s;ued; which &s;erved only to convince the heareis, that much might be &s;aid to little purpo&s;e; that a multiplicity of illu&s;trations have often the property of confounding the more; and that law is like nothing el&s;e but it&s;elf. It being, neverthele&s;s, finally determined, on the principles of univer&s;al equity, that if property was left unprotected from the depredations of the idle and profligate, indu&s;try would be di&s;couraged, confidence de&s;troyed, and &s;ociety aboli&s;hed; the perpetrator of deeds calculated &s;o e&s;&s;en|tially to injure the &s;ocial compact &s;hould con&s;equently be extirpated for the benefit of the community at large; IN|FIDELITY was condemned to an ignominous death, as a warning to others: a &s;entence which he only anticipated, by &s;hooting him&s;elf in pri&s;on. Nor was the end of his companion, though more pitiable, le&s;s dreadful; he was found hanging in his chamber, a mi&s;erable martyr to that unwarrantable de&s;pondency which he had always prac|ti&s;ed as well as taught.</P>
<P>Thus our two p&s;eudo-reformers terminated their la|bours; leaving the world, &s;o far as their influence extend|ed, much wor&s;e than they found it.</P>
<P>Happily, however, they were &s;ucceeded by a divine Female, who&s;e principles differed from both; and who convinced mankind, by their re&s;pective fates, how little their doctrines were to be relied on for the attainment of &s;ub&s;tantial felicity. This Female was chearful without levity, and &s;erious without being &s;ad. She tolerated every innocent enjoyment, and forbade nothing but exce&s;s. She proved, from Nature and Rea&s;on, that all things had their origin in a Supreme Being, who was, con&s;equently, en|titled to their homage; that he was to be con&s;idered as a wi&s;e and affectionate Father, who exacted not the &s;ervice of a &s;lave, but the duty of a child; more ready to pardon than to puni&s;h: who, at once &s;trictly benevolent and ju&s;t,
<PB N="42" REF="42">
never corrected, but for &s;alutary purpo&s;es; and, equally aver&s;e to au&s;tenty and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, preferred the &s;weet incen&s;e of mercy to the pedantick pageantry of &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>The dignity of her mien, and divinity of her precepts, &s;oon attracted the &s;erious attention of the multitude. A few, who had actually been in the daily habits of con|ver&s;ing with her, proclaimed her to be RELIGION; of whom all had heard, and mo&s;t of them, though &s;trangers to her per&s;on, affected to venerate and follow. Her pre|&s;ence, however, produced a great revolution in the man|ners of men: the votaries of INFIDELITY grew a&s;hamed of their exce&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e of FANATICISM were happy in an opportunity of emancipating them&s;elves from the tyranny of &s;uper&s;tition. Numbers daily flocked to her for con&s;olation; &s;he received them with benevolence, and introduced them to VIRTUE, the prie&s;te&s;s of HAPPINESS; who conducted them to the temple of that Power, under who&s;e influence every human being is &s;o ardently &s;olici|tous to live.</P>

<P>&mdash;"I Wi&s;h thee &s;ucce&s;s," &s;aid a clergyman, put|ting &s;omething into an old &s;oldier's hand&mdash;"Adieu!"&mdash;"Heaven return it thee!" exclaimed the &s;oldier, with a look that &s;poke more to the heart than all the expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude that ever were uttered. His wife curt&s;ied. "God ble&s;s you both!" &s;aid the good divine, and rode on. The veteran fixed his eyes on him in &s;ilence, till he turned out of &s;ight. "What is it?" en|quired the &s;oldier's wife. "A guinea!" replied the &s;ol|dier, wrapping it up carefully in a paper, and putting it into a grea&s;y vellum pocket-book, the repo&s;itory of his humble trea&s;ures. It had been his companion in all ad|ventures, from childhood&mdash;and a faithful one. He e&s;teem|ed it as a friend; and, unlike modern friends, it kept every &s;ecret with which it was entru&s;ted inviolate. It contained&mdash;the pride of his heart&mdash;a memorial, in his own hand|writing, of all the battles he had fought, and the wounds he had received; up to that day on which the ruthle&s;s ball tore away the very arm which had &s;o often wielded the in&s;truments of vengeance again&s;t the enemies of his coun|try from his &s;caried body. Here the heroick narrative was deficient; but the remaining &s;tump vouched for him&mdash;how much more impre&s;&s;ively! Through this misfortune he obtained his di&s;charge; that, too, was pre&s;erved, a companion to his memorial; to which was affixed, &s;igned by all his officers, a te&s;timony of his <HI>honourable</HI> conduct. It was the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having merited this that transfu&s;ed a gl$am of happine&s;s over all his de&s;pon|dencies: over the&s;e faithful memorials he frequently &s;hed a tear, which &s;weetened the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, and be&s;towed a con&s;olation only to be imbibed by minds attuned to the delicate harmony of Sen&s;ibility at the refined touch of Virtue.</P>
<P>Grant, Almighty Di&s;po&s;er of events! that <HI>my</HI> heart may ever be awake to the &s;till voice of honour; that the &s;ea&s;on of calamity may not be rendered more $ik&s;ome by the inquietudes of con&s;cience!</P>

<P>"There are <HI>&s;ome</HI> good people left in the world," ob|&s;erved his wife. "Heaven forbid there &s;hould not!" an|&s;wered the hu&s;band&mdash;and on they jogged, till an humble hou&s;e of entertainment pre&s;ented to them a welcome &s;ight.

<P>The weather was cold; but they placed them&s;elves, mode&s;tly, at a di&s;tance from the fire, though it was not quite taken up.

<P>The &s;oldier heard, but noticed it not: he knew the power of money, and accompanied his enquiry for re|fre&s;hment, with a with to have change for a guinea.

in oblivion!&mdash;Alas! I am guiltier than thy&s;elf. I &s;et thee an example. How frail is man! how vain his rea|&s;oning!</P>
<P>The two travellers began their little repa&s;t. The land|lord joined them. The &s;oldier &s;miled him a chearful wel|come. The mug was twice filled; and the table &s;oon cleared. They all gathered clo&s;e around the fire; and the &s;oldier related the adventure of the clergyman and the <HI>guinea.</HI></P>
<P>The landlord "<HI>dare &s;aid,"</HI> be&s;ide that guinea, the par|&s;on had not above another in the world. "Gemmen," for they were all &s;trangers, "it is the curate of our pari&s;h, and a more <HI>worthier</HI> &s;oul never lived! He has a wife and four children; and has but fifty pound a year to maintain them, though the rector&s;hip is worth five times as much. But the old rector died ye&s;terday; and &s;o the curate came here to hire one of my hor&s;es&mdash;I keeps two, gemmen&mdash;to go to the Squire's to beg for the living; and he has all the pari&s;h's good words and prayers with him."&mdash;"Hea|ven grant he may &s;ucceed!" emphatically interrupted the &s;oldier. "So &s;ays I!" rejoined the ho&s;t; accompanying the hearty affirmation with as hearty a tug at the &s;oldier's ale&mdash;"But, neverthele&s;s, gemmen, I fears as how he wo'n't; for his honour the Squire, though they &s;ays &s;omething as how the e&s;tate i'n't rightfully his&mdash;but I wouldn't have it known I &s;poke of it&mdash;I &s;corns to meddle with other folks affairs&mdash;be&s;ides, he might take away my licence, and times are hard&mdash;but Mr. Martin, a gentle|man in the neighbourhood, knows all about it. And &s;o, as I was a &s;aying, gemmen, the Squire has often's the time been heard to &s;ay that he would &s;ell the <HI>par&s;ontation;</HI> and I am &s;ure Dr. Kind can't buy it: for, as I &s;aid, he is but poor&mdash;and that was the rea&s;on that I wouldn't take any thing of him for the lent of my hor&s;e&mdash;and he had the be&s;t too&mdash;though he does n't buy two noggins of ale of me in a month. But then, to be &s;ure, he is par&s;on of the pari&s;h, and does n't get drunk. Here's his health, gem|men!' &s;eizing a pot that &s;tood next him, and calling his wife to repleni&s;h the &s;oldier's, which was empty.</P>
<P>When the ale was drawn, the &s;oldier produced his guinea for change. Scorum, and his rib, having both rummaged their pockets for the amount, found they were
<PB N="46" REF="46">
&s;even &s;hillings deficient. "What the devil ha&s;t done with all thy &s;ilver?" cried Scorum. "Why, my dear," rep$$d &s;he, m$$kly, "didn't I give it to Dr. Kind out of the ha$$ g$$n$a for the h$$e of the hor$e?" This rather confu&s;ed o$$ <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> ho&s;t: but, not being ea&s;ily put out of $Word$, and thinking &s;ilence be&s;t, he took no other $Word$ of the circum&s;tance, than to bid her go and get change; winking to her very &s;ignificantly, at the &s;ame time. The company had &s;at for &s;ome time, enjoying them&s;elves in &s;ilence, here and there interrupted by a$$ite ob&s;ervation, when the piper offered to play them a tune. A dance was accordingly propo&s;ed: but objected to, at fir&s;t, by mine ho&s;t, who ob$erved, "as how it &s;poiled good company." However, finding it nece&s;&s;ary to con|form to the humour of his cu&s;tomers, he determined to lo&s;e nothing by the temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from drinking; and, $Word$ empt$ed the onl$ $ug that had liquor in it, ordered his wife&mdash;who now returned with "She couldn't get change, though &s;he had been at a dozen places!"&mdash;to fill all again, and &s;tood up with the re&s;t. The piper be|gan; and at it they went, if not with &s;kill, at lea&s;t with glee.</P>
<P>How $Word$ is the tenure of joy! The piper had &s;carcely thrice repeated his &s;train, when in came the land|lady, and informed her &s;pou&s;e, that Mr Martin was c$me for his hor&s;e, which they had le$$ the Doctor in the morning. She was followed by the gentleman. <HI>Scorum</HI> was again confu&s;ed; and &s;tammered out, that as how it had $Word$ &s;$$ing, and &s;o he had &s;ent it to town. But Mr. Martin, who had overheard all the wife had &s;aid, $Span$ quent with his guilt. He now begged ten thou$and pardons; and while the owner a&s;&s;ured him, that had he $ent it to any o$e el&s;e, he would never have ex|cu&s;ed him, the divine entered. The landlord &s;wore for joy, and $an out to receive the hor&s;e; and the Doctor Mr. Martin &s;hook hands, and were retiring into the par|lour, when the former e$pied the objects of his benevo|lence; and, apolog$$zing to his friend, reque&s;ted their com|pany al&s;o. Thinking it their duty not to refu&s;e, they mo|de&s;tly obeyed; and, a chearful bowl being in&s;tantly filled, they all &s;at down to enjoy it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="47">
The &s;oldier was ag$tated concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of his benefactor: it was not bu&s;y &s;olicitude, but the anxiety of gratitude. The Doctor was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; and the &s;oldier, per&s;uaded of his &s;ucce&s;s by the uniform chearful|ne&s;s of his manners, &s;et his own heart at $Word$</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s generally excites <HI>curio&s;ity&mdash;</HI>&s;eldom any thing farther. The appearance of the veteran excited that of Martin: but he was a humane man; and it was a $$uda|ble motive that induced him to hint, in a delicate manner, a de&s;ire of being acquainted with his hi&s;tory. The &s;oldier readily gratified him.</P>
<P>His name, he &s;aid, was Roach; his father bore arms. He was born at Ca$$$ckfe$gus, in Ireland; and, when but two years old, his father being ordered abroad, his mother took him with her to follow the fortunes of her hu&s;band. At fourteen, he lo&s;t his mother; and, at &s;ix|teen, his father. He fought by his &s;ide; &s;aw him fall; and had the plea&s;ure of revenging him on the man who &s;lew him. His life had been literally a continual war|fare&mdash;but he had been rai&s;ed only to a halbert.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin expre&s;&s;ed &s;urprize&mdash;merit is ever mode&s;t. "I de&s;erved no more," was the reply. He proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>He had been thrice impri&s;oned in France, once in Spain, and once in Holland. "But I tru&s;ted in God!" &s;aid the hero. "And he delivered thee," returned the di|vine.&mdash;During an interval between the two la&s;t impri|&s;onments he had &s;uffered, for the &s;econd time &s;ince he was two years of age, he &s;aw England He then married; and his wife had been his con&s;tant companion in all his &s;ucceeding troubles. At fifty, he lo&s;t his arm in the lamentable war that &s;eparated England and America: at Bunker's Hill he received the &s;atal &s;hot; and, with the united te&s;timony of all his officers concerning his fidelity and bravery, was &s;ent to fini&s;h his days in the mother country. He applied for the pen&s;ion. Merit is not al|ways &s;ucce&s;sful: he was mode&s;t; and had not a friend at court. He applied in vain!</P>
<P>His wife had a relation in Wales, a creditable, though not a rich, farmer: to him they went, and lived with him, labouring for their maintenance, four years. He then died; and, being ignorant of any other relations, left them his all. They were indu&s;trious, they were frugal:
<PB N="48" REF="48">
but pro&s;perity is not always the reward of indu&s;try, and the frugal are &s;ometimes &s;paring in vain. The hand of Providence &s;eemed again&s;t them; but the ways of Heaven are in&s;crutable! Their cattle died; their crops failed! Their all was nearly gone; when the hone&s;t pair called their creditors together, and &s;urrendered to them the little that remained; and, taking an affectionate farewel of their neighbours, who all pitied, but were too poor ma|terially to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, &s;et off for London, to $ue once more for the pen&s;ion; fearing, at the &s;ame time, that they had de$$r$$d the application too long.</P>
<P>They had travelled four days chearfully; when they lo&s;t the pur&s;e which held the pittance they had to &s;upport them on their journey! But they were re&s;igned: they had begged through the fifth; and, on the &s;ixth, they were met by the charitable curate. Here the narrator repeated his thanks; and the clergyman in&s;i&s;ted they were not due, having done nothing more than his duty.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin, apologizing, enquired of the &s;oldier where his father fell? "At Dettingen!" He had no relation living? None, that he knew of. Had he once a brother, chri&s;tened Leonard, after his father; who, when he went abroad, was left with an aunt at Carrickfergus, and was then five years old. He addre&s;&s;ed to him an account of his father's fate; but did not him&s;elf &s;ee Ireland till &s;ix years afterwards. He then heard that his aunt was dead; but, from all the enquiries he could make, had never been able to learn what became of his brother, or whe|ther he received the letter concerning his father. "He did&punc;" interrupted Martin. The clergyman, the &s;oldier, and his wife, all fixed their eyes on him. "Heavens! is he alive?" eagerly exclaimed the &s;erjeant. "No!" deeply &s;ighed Mr. Martin. "He was my intimate friend. About &s;ix months after the receipt of your letter, he quitted Ireland; and, in the &s;ervice of a foreign mer|chant, thrice travelled over the continent of Europe. His $Word$ and zeal to attached him to his employer, who now &s;ettled in England, that he entertained him no longer as a &s;ervant, but made him his companion and confident; and, dying about eight years &s;ince, bequeathed him an e&s;tate in this county, amounting to eight hundred per annum, together with the pre&s;entation of the pari&s;h living."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
Here the clergyman &s;eemed rather di&s;compo&s;ed. The &s;oldier ob&s;erved it. Mr Martin went on&mdash;</P>
<P>"About this time, I became acquainted with your brother. He imparted to me every circum&s;tance of his lite. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in perpetual enquiries after you, but in vain; and accidentally di&s;covering a cou&s;in of your aunt's, out of gratitude to her, at his death, about four years &s;ince, excepting a legacy of two hundred pounds a year to me, he made him his &s;ole heir: with a provi&s;o, that if ever you could be found, the whole e&s;tate was to be your own, on condition of your allowing him two hundred pounds per annum. Nothing, then, remains, Sir, but to make the requi&s;ite proofs before the proper per&s;ons, which we will do without delay. Indeed, the &s;trong re&s;emblance you bear to your brother, is te&s;timony enough for me; but there are others to be &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>"Prai&s;ed be Heaven!" exclaimed the good Doctor. The &s;oldier's wife was tran&s;ported&mdash;&s;he wept for joy.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier bore has good fortune with admirable &s;e|renity. "I &s;hould have received mo$$ plea&s;ure from this news," &s;aid he, "had not my cou&s;in fore&s;talled me in the wi&s;h of my heart, and prevented me from expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to that generous gentleman, in a proper manner, by giving him the living."&mdash;"<HI>Give</HI> you the living, Dr. Kind?" exclaimed Mr. Martin. "He had bargained for it with Dr. Double."&mdash;"He has not broken the con|tract, I can a&s;&s;ure you," replied Dr. Kind. "Is i$ not yours, there?" ha&s;tily cried the &s;older. "But it &s;hall&mdash;it &s;hall be!" And he took &s;everal turns, or rather quick marches, acro&s;s the room. His heart was full&mdash;a tear re|lieved him</P>
<P>In a few weeks his re$$i&s;ter from Ireland, and every nece&s;&s;ary voucher for his identity, we$$ procu$ed. He a&s;&s;erted his claim; every $Span$, except his cou&s;in; he took po&s;&s;e$$$ $Span$ Mr. M$$|tin, in vain, to accept a $Span$ and, in pre&s;enting the rectory to the benevolent $Word$, expe|rienced the &s;u$$lime&s;t grat$$$$tion of a noble $Word$, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having, by promo$$g the indepen|dence of Virtue, di&s;charged the obligation of Grati|tude.</P>

<HEAD>THE OLD MAIDS ORDEAL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>AN <HI>Old Maid,</HI> if I may he permitted to u&s;e the com|pari&s;on, without incu$$ing the imputation of dure|&s;pect for the fair &s;ex, which I totally di&s;avow, &s;eems to be con&s;idered as the <HI>Owl</HI> of human nature; for, as the whole feathered t$$be &s;eize joyfully every opportunity to torment that unhappy bird, though the favourite of wi&s;|dom; &s;o have the re&s;t of the human race conceived a &s;trange antipatny again&s;t the Old Maid; whom they con|&s;ider as fair game, and are continually attacking with the weapons both of $$$cule and mi&s;chief. Like the Owl, &s;he is a &s;olitary animal; and many of her &s;pecies are ac|cu&s;ed of preying, in &s;ecret, on the reputations even of the innocent; as the type which I have &s;elected for her de&s;troys, in the dark, not only mice, her natural food, but very frequently the moffen&s;ive inhabitants of the dove cote.</P>
<P>However, mo&s;t popular prejudices are ab&s;urd; and not one of the lea&s;t &s;o, is that entertained again&s;t this not over|numerous cla&s;s of females. For why, I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a&s;k, in a land of liberty, and e&s;pecially that of con&s;cience, &s;hould not a woman, when a man in&s;i&s;ts upon it as his privilege, be &s;uffered to follow the bias of her own inclination, in a point on which her terre&s;trial happine&s;s principally depends, without being liable either to the odium of guilt, on the &s;arca&s;ms of folly? In an age when matrimony is &s;o far degraded, as in many ca&s;es to be, according to a celebrated writer, no other than <HI>legal pro&s;titution;</HI> and, in mo&s;t, whether through ma&s;cu&s;me tyranny, or feminine ambition, I &s;hall not attempt to decide, a &s;tate of ince&s;&s;ant repining and contention: I think it ought not to be a matter of &s;o much wonder, that a woman &s;hould chu&s;e rather to retain her liberty, than &s;ub$$t to wear the yoke with heavine&s;s and di&s;cord; particularly, as a breach of the Hymeneal vow, on the <HI>m$le</HI> &s;ide, is looked on with &s;uch perfect indifference, that even a brace of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are as fa&s;hionable appen|dages
<PB N="52" REF="52">
to a modern married man of rank, as trinkets for a top, or ruffles for a dancing-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>But, allowing wedlock to be that &s;tate of ineffable bli&s;s, the de&s;cription of which we have all &s;een &s;o often attempt|ed in vain; and which it undoubtedly might be, when founded on e&s;teem, prudence, and piety, and <HI>then only;</HI> I cannot but conceive, that tho&s;e who exclude them&s;elves from it, are &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed by foregoing the trea|&s;ure they di&s;claim; without being continually &s;ubject to opprobrious reflection, and unmanly in&s;ult. Celibacy may, in many ca&s;es, be a folly; but, perhaps, in very few a crime.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Old Maids, I am ready to allow, pro|perly objects of cen&s;ure; but mo&s;t of them, I am con|vinced, are real &s;ubjects for pity, and &s;ome worthy of re&s;pectful veneration. When a woman lo$es all her ad|mirers, or, which is wor&s;e, never attracts any, through malignancy of heart, or in&s;tability of di&s;po&s;ition, one naturally feels little concern for her: but as females are not allowed, con&s;i&s;tent with our ideas of decorum, to chu&s;e for them&s;elves; and mu&s;t therefore wait with pa|tience till a man &s;hall offer whom they can love, and which to many may never happen; they are often ne|ce&s;&s;itated to take involuntary refuge in celibacy, rather than connect them&s;elves without a pro&s;pect of felicity: and &s;uch are, indi&s;putably, entitled to the kinde&s;t offices of condolence.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t refined, yet &s;malle&s;t cla&s;s of Old Maids, are tho&s;e, independent of the tenet &s;upported by many of the fathers, "that the order of nature and the in&s;titutions of Providence render it incumbent on all to marry"&mdash;the validity of which need not here be examined&mdash;who ab|&s;tract them&s;elves freely from the &s;peculations of matri|mony, in order to employ their time, uncontrouled, in conciliating the jealou&s;ies, &s;ympathizing with the &s;or|rows, and relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, of their fellow-creatures, in proportion to their ability; and, in the language of Scripture, like the wi&s;e virgins, "in preparing their lamps again&s;t the wedding &s;upper of the Lamb." Perhaps, in &s;trict propriety, the&s;e, and the&s;e only, &s;hould be called <HI>virgins;</HI> for, as the merit of any action is to be deduced from the will, tho&s;e who continue &s;ingle through accident,
<PB N="53" REF="53">
di&s;appointment, or nece&s;&s;ity, &s;urely forfeit all preten&s;ions to the title, as wanting the chief requi&s;ite, inclination.</P>
<P>Revolving the foregoing ob&s;ervations in my mind, I was in&s;en&s;ibly tran&s;ported to the regions of Fancy; and found my&s;elf in a crouded court of ju&s;tice, convened, as I under&s;tood, for the trial of &s;uch females, above twenty-one years of age, as had departed this life in the &s;ame <HI>maiden</HI> &s;tate they had entered it. They were arraigned, at the in&s;tance of <HI>Hymen;</HI> who, di&s;plea&s;ed at lo&s;ing &s;o many votaries, took this method of procuring &s;atisfaction from tho&s;e who could not produce &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for their conduct. <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> pre&s;ided, robed in white; and, in order to di&s;pen&s;e with witne&s;&s;es, pleadings, and many other formalities, <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> with a wand, which had the property of exacting the truth, touched the lips of each delinquent as &s;he approached the bar; and, thus con|&s;trained, each told her &s;tory without prevarication.</P>
<P>To minute the event of every trial would be frivolous; many were &s;entenced to the company of apes, parrots, lap-dogs, and &s;quirrels; or to provide warm corners for incorrigible batchelors; &s;ome to form amaranthine wreaths for worthy matrons; and &s;ome were allowed to return to that in&s;ipid tranquillity in which they had pa&s;&s;ed their lives.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, mention a few particulars, for the &s;atisfaction of the curious, and the contemplation of tho&s;e individually concerned.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who pre&s;ented her&s;elf at the bar, had long exceeded her climacterick. She had been beautiful when young, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many &s;uitors, all of whom &s;he lo&s;t, through haughtine&s;s; however, when her charms were in the wane, and &s;he found her&s;elf de&s;erted; repenting her folly, &s;he employed every art to recal tho&s;e who had for&s;aken her, but in vain; and, as &s;he could never be per&s;uaded &s;he was growing old, practi&s;ed at fifty &s;ix all the airs of &s;ixteen; till death, in pity, relieved her from a &s;tate of anxiety and de&s;pair. She was condemned to wander behind the <HI>Lovers Paradi&s;e;</HI> to be witne&s;s to bli&s;s &s;he had fooli&s;hly forfeited, and which &s;he could now never ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The next was a lady who had been both agreeable and rich, but who confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had never but two offers
<PB N="54" REF="54">
in her life; both of which &s;he refu&s;ed&mdash;the one was from a profe&s;&s;ed rake; and the other, from a man who&s;e anxious devotion was attracted by her wealth. Cha&s;tity, com|mending her di&s;cretion and &s;pirit, con&s;igned her to the keeper of the <HI>Virgins Ely&s;ium.</HI></P>
<P>She was &s;ucceeded by two, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: the one, a lady of <HI>Quality;</HI> and the other, of <HI>Quantity.</HI> They had both rejected all their lovers; the one, becau&s;e &s;he had never met with any of <HI>equal rank</HI> with her&s;elf; and the other, in con&s;equence of experiencing the &s;ame th$ng relative to <HI>fortune.</HI> They were laughed at by the where court; and Hymen ob&s;erved, with indignation, that to &s;uch notion$ were owing the many mi&s;erable unions which had given occa&s;ion for reflections on his profe&s;&s;ion. They were &s;ent to the <HI>Paradi&s;e of Fools;</HI> with orders for their crimes to be written indelibly on their forehe$$s, whence it was &s;uppo&s;ed they would become eternal objects of ridicule, even to that incon&s;i&s;tent a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A lady, with an air of bewitching good-nature, now came forward. She was born rich; and had cho&s;en a &s;ingle life, in order to di&s;po&s;e of her fortune in port$oring &s;everal poor, but worthy couples: &s;he had, through a long life, the un&s;peakable plea&s;ure of contemplating the &s;cenes of happine&s;s &s;he had given ri&s;e to, and now claimed the &s;ce$es of her unparalleled di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. H$m$n, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had added &s;o many to the number of his adh$rents, regretted the lo&s;s of her; ob&s;erving, "that &s;he $Word$, as a wife, have reflected &s;uch an honour on wedlock, as to have retrieved, probably, all the reputa|tion he had lo&s;t." Chartity, however, thinking her a proper companion for her&s;elf, entreated her, before &s;he entered Blynum, to join her on the bench, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in $Word$ the remaining cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The next was a female, who candidly declared, that &s;he never had an honourable offer in her life. "Poor thing!" unanimou&s;ly and emphatically exclaimed all the ladies below the bar. Hymen admitted the cogency of her plea; and the judge tran&s;lated her to Ely&s;ium, to make amends for her di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Another now &s;tepped up, who was born remarkably beautiful, and had broken the hearts of a &s;core or more lovers; encouraging their addre&s;&s;es till &s;he had en&s;laved
<PB N="55" REF="55">
their &s;ouls, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them to enjoy the triumph of their de&s;pair. On being a&s;ked her rea&s;ons for &s;uch inhuman conduct, &s;he ver$ boldly replied, to revenge the wrongs of her &s;ex&mdash;"Bravo!" re ech$$l through the court. But, &s;ilence being called, the Ama$on was &s;en|tenced to be turned loo&s;e into the <HI>Grove for de&s;ponding Lovers,</HI> who had fallen victims to the pa$hon, where her cruelties would be &s;ufficiently reta$iated on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>After her removal, came a $Word$ who, having pro|mi&s;ed her&s;elf in marriage to a creditable young man, who was very fond of her, re&s;cinded her agreement in favour of a fortune-hunter who made propo&s;als to her, but who, before the day fixed for their nuptials, ran away with a di&s;tingui&s;hed he$re&s;s. She now endeavoured to regain her old lover; but, finding all her efforts vain, exerted every artifice to injure him in the e&s;teem of a worthy young lady who&s;e affections he had gained, and whom he in fact married. To her extreme mortification, they enjoyed enviable happine&s;s; which &s;he, however, in$e$|fantly tried to interrupt: and, at la&s;t, $Word$ in con&s;e|quence of a cold caught by walking in a $Word$ &s;hower, from a vi&s;it &s;he had been paying for the purpo&s;e of &s;pread|ing a report to their di&s;advantage. She was remanded back to earth&mdash;it being fir&s;t ordained, that no one &s;hould in future believe what &s;he &s;aid&mdash;there to continue a far|ther witne&s;s of their conjugal bl$&s;s, which was thought the greate&s;t puni&s;hment po&s;&s;ible to be infl$cted on her.</P>
<P>Her $Word$ was &s;upplied by a $Span$ offender; who, being both too ugly, and too wicked, to attract notice, determined to revenge the $Word$ of the men, on the unmarried members of her own &s;ex. In con&s;equence, through the m$di$ms of treachery and d$$$mation, &s;he broke many matches which were on the point of being concluded; and poi&s;oned the happine&s;s of many couples, who&s;e union &s;he h$d vainly ende$our$d $o prevent. The whole court was loud in it's $Word$ again&s;t her; and &s;he was doomed to be chained to a $ock, in the <HI>Old Maid</HI>'s <HI>Tartarus,</HI> and to $Word$ a <HI>$Word$</HI> puni&s;h|ment; with this difference, that the part to be devouted was her <HI>tongue.</HI></P>
<P>This culprit gave way to a blu&s;hing maid of twenty-two, who&s;e features I immediately recognized. She had
<PB N="56" REF="56">
been addre&s;&s;ed by a young man on whom &s;he doated; but her confidential friend &s;educed him from her. They were privately married, and the fir&s;t intelligence was exu$tingly conveyed to her by the abandoned object of treachery. The &s;hock proved too great for the delicacy of her con&s;titution; &s;he fell a martyr to de&s;pondency; and, only two days before, I had followed her to the grave. On her being a&s;ked to give an account of her&s;elf, &s;he bur&s;t into tears: when, leaving the crowd, and &s;tepping up to the bar, I began to relate her &s;tory; but was pre&s;ently interrupted, and interrogated as to my bu&s;ine&s;s there? I &s;tood confounded; and Hymen, eyeing me keenly, and declaring that I was a <HI>Batchelor,</HI> the place began to be up in arms, and the whole body of females were proceeding to vent their indignation upon me; when their clamours at once put an end to their rage, and my fears, by awak|ing me.</P>

<HEAD>THE COURT OF HYMEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE, the mo&s;t &s;alutary compact of &s;ociety, like all other beneficent de&s;igns, is by it's pre&s;ent arrangements &s;o far pervented from original purity, as to become the dread of many, the &s;corn of more, and the je&s;t of mo&s;t: but, as it is well known that this &s;tate, under the au&s;pices of Rea&s;on and Virtue, is capable of producing the mo&s;t exalted plea&s;ures, whenever it pre|&s;ents us with in&s;tances of inquietude, we may naturally conclude that it's ordinances have been vi$lated; and to depreciate the &s;pirit of any in&s;titution, for the irregularities of &s;ome of it's members, is certainly unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Being tran&s;lated to the Temple of Hymen, I heard Fame proclaiming-on account of the many a&s;per&s;ions of cruel|ty and tyranny that power had long laboured under, &s;uch of his votaries as thought them&s;elves aggrieved, were invited to repair to his tribunal with their complaints, that the nature of their &s;everal ca&s;es might be con&s;idered, and relief extended where deemed nece&s;&s;ary. The court filled in an in&s;tant, each couple contending for the fir&s;t audi|ence, and it was a long time before order could be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; but being at la&s;t effected, a gay pair&mdash;mere girl and boy&mdash;pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the bar, from whence complainants were allowed to plead. It turned out to be a Gretna Green match: they had been wedded but &s;ix months, and de&s;pi&s;ed each other as heartily as they had before admired.</P>
<P>Hymen informed them, that they were wrong in ac|cu&s;ing him as the author of the mi&s;ery they had brought on them&s;elves. He ob&s;erved, that in no &s;tate would they find happine&s;s unconnected with virtue: that matrimony was de&s;igned for the benefit of mankind; con&s;equently it's ba&s;is was founded by Ju&s;tice, who&s;e oeconomy they had infringed in the very circum&s;tance of their union, as obe|dience to parents was one of the mo&s;t po&s;itive articles of her &s;upreme law. Parents, he confe&s;&s;ed, were &s;ometimes
<PB N="59" REF="59">
unrea&s;onable in their commands; but <HI>green youth</HI> was &s;eldom capable of judging for $Word$&mdash;of which <HI>they</HI> were a &s;triking in&s;tance&mdash;con&s;equently, in mo&s;t ca&s;$s criminal to di&s;pute mandates in tend$ncy beyond it's capacity; and, even in ca&s;es where it had power of deciding, re|mon&s;trance was to be u&s;ed, not rebellion. Had they not been &s;o ha&s;ty, they might, by proper reflection, have di&s;|covered the cau&s;es of parental interdiction, otherwi&s;e than by the bondage of experience. "Be&s;ides," he continued, "marriage, unconnected with love, from the common nature of things, could never prove grateful; and Love, though fervent, was not impetuous: and, whatever man|kind might conceive relative to his being blind, wanton, and weak; he was, on the contrary, &s;harp-&s;ighted, &s;trong|ly affected towards Virtue, and always li&s;tened to the vo$ce of Di&s;cretion." They had mi&s;taken, for this bene|volent pa&s;&s;ion, an intemperate being, called <HI>Infatuation;</HI> who had converted the ro&s;eate ce&s;tus with which Hymen pr$&s;ented them into a yoke, which they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be$r with patience; as it would ill become him, as a mi|ni&s;ter of ju&s;tice, though &s;ometimes ordained by the fates an agent of vengeance on the impious, to be&s;tow that in|dulgence to di&s;appointed Guilt, meant only for the relief of deluded Virtue. A&s;&s;uring them, therefore, that Pru|dence would &s;ugge&s;t many methods of alleviation, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them, perfectly di&s;&s;atisfied with his lecture.</P>
<P>The next pair who came forward to reproach Hymen, equally in effect criminated each other. Avarice was im|poted as the cau&s;e of di&s;agreement on the part of the gen|tleman, and prodigality on that of the lady. The object of the former, in marrying, was to augment his fortune; and that of the latter, to enable her to &s;upport an <HI>equipage,</HI> which was made one of the principal features of the mar|riage treaty; on condition, however, that Madam &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with the article of <HI>pin-money.</HI> To make up this lo&s;s, &s;he had recour&s;e to gaming; and the hu&s;band, in con&s;equence, had &s;o many <HI>debts of honour</HI> to di&s;charge, that he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;tand to his agreement. Hy|men ridiculed them for &s;uppo&s;ing bli&s;s could po&s;&s;ibly at|tend an union cemented on &s;o &s;ordid a principle: but, that they might have no farther pretext to charge him with inju&s;tice, he offered to di&s;&s;olve their bonds; provided the
<PB N="60" REF="60">
hu&s;band would agree to return the wife's dower, or that &s;he would be con$ent that he &s;hould keep it wholly. To this neither would $Word$; and they both retired, as little plea&s;ed as the preceding couple.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding cau&s;e was nearly of the &s;ame nature. <HI>Fortune</HI> was the &s;ure on one &s;id$, and <HI>Title</HI> on the other. The deci&s;ion corre&s;ponded with that already given.</P>
<P>A very modi&s;h pair now, on being interrogated, Why did they ma$$y? replied&mdash;"For a whim!" Hymen re|marked, as they were &s;uch humou$i&s;ts, &s;hould he divide them, they might take a new whim to be joined again; and as he, po&s;&s;ibly, might not then be in the humour to indulge them, he thought, to &s;ave them from future in|convenience, it would be be&s;t to leave them as they were. The gentleman told him, that he was a queer fellow; and retired, p$$king his teeth; while the lady followed him, humming an ope$a tune.</P>
<P>A feeble old man, and a &s;prightly young girl, were next in rotation. Without being heard, they were told, that they de&s;erved every thing they might have to complain of; as they had, by uniting, committed trea&s;on again&s;t nature. They were accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with contempt.</P>
<P>The next hu&s;band taxed his wife with adultery, which &s;he defended on the &s;co$e of ill-u&s;age. It turned out, however, that this &s;park kept a brace of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Hy|men &s;trenly demanded of him how he dared to appear there with &s;uch a charge, con&s;idering the predicament in which he &s;tood; declaring that, in mo&s;t ca&s;es where wo|men were accu&s;ed of m$delity, it originated from men's &s;etting them the example. Informing the wife, however, that her hu&s;band's defection was no palliation of her crime, he ordered them from the place, amid the hootings of the whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The following couple di&s;liked each other even on the day of marriage; but had attended the altar, at the com|mands of their re&s;pective parents, and their aver&s;ion had been daily increa&s;ing. The judge highly commended their $$lial obedience, and confe&s;&s;ed it de&s;erved a better reward than ince&s;&s;ant di&s;cord: but ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame time, that they had not given the matter a fair trial; that they had met with prejudice, which in&s;tead of endeavouring to &s;ur|mount, they appeared to have embraced every opportunity
<PB N="61" REF="61">
to fortify. He differed, he &s;aid, f$$m the received <HI>pru|dential</HI> opinion&mdash;"Many fir&s;t, and love will come after;" but advi&s;ed them, for the rea&s;ons he $a$ given, to attempt a courteous mode of $Span$ towards $Word$ other, which time might upon, into $Span$. If, and $$peated $$$als, however, they &s;hould find the $Word$ &s;hall painful, on being again applied to, he prom$$$$ to take proper &s;teps for their deliverance. They m$d$ their ob$$&s;ance, and withdrew, &s;eemingly very w$ll &s;ati$fied.</P>
<P>The merits of the next cau&s;e, w$$e tho&s;e of two-thirds of mod$$$ unions. The complainants had been united, after a very $hort court&s;hip, in con&s;equence of the gentle|man's having &s;aid a great many fine things to the lady; and treated her to all places of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort, mer$ly becau&s;e &s;he dre&s;&s;ed the &s;marte&s;t of his female acquain|tance, and under&s;tood <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> as little as him&s;elf. Hymen directed them to ob&s;erve the &s;ame methods to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> each others affection as they had taken to <HI>goin</HI> it; and ordered them to make room for a hu&s;band accu&s;ing his wife of <HI>democracy,</HI> who recriminated on him with the charge of <HI>ari&s;tocracy.</HI> Hymen ob&s;erved, &s;miling, that a man would naturally be a matrimonial ari&s;tocrate, under the idea of his being lord and ma&s;ter; and a woman the contrary, from her antipathy to having a &s;uperior. But, he told them, to obtain plea&s;ure, they &s;hould follow the advice of the philo&s;opher; who, being applied to for his opinion on a &s;imilar &s;ubject, pre&s;ented the que$i&s;ts with the repre&s;entation of two ox$n ploughing, with a reference to the words&mdash;"Draw equal."</P>
<P>A mode&s;t young woman, and a ferocious looking man, were next. By repeated profe&s;&s;ions of love, and extreme appearances of tenderne&s;s, the woman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a trifling fortune, had been induced to give her hand to a villain, who$$ hypo$rity originated in the contemplation of her dow$; which having &s;quandered, he not only con|tinually abu&s;ed, but beat, and many ways inhumanly treated her. They were immediately &s;eparated: &s;he was delivered to Peace, who $ea$$ed the $$ded ro&s;e of her cheek; and he to Infamy, who branded him on the fore|head, and then dro$e him out of the temple.</P>
<P>A wife, who accu&s;ed her hu&s;band, $Word$ it is commonly expre&s;&s;ed, of wearing the <HI>petticoats;</HI> and a hu&s;band, who
<PB N="62" REF="62">
taxed his wife with the &s;ame thing relaive to the <HI>breeches;</HI> now took up the attention of the court. They were &s;oon, however, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: the man being told that, if he gave up the <HI>$&s;igma</HI> of ma&s;ter&s;hip, he had no one but him&s;elf to blame; and the woman, that &s;he ought, at lea&s;t, to be contented with the power of governing, a privilege mo&s;t of her &s;ex would be tran&s;ported with.</P>
<P>Their room was &s;upplied by the very couple who, as is well known, qua$$$lled $Span$, on apprea|tion for the memorable $Word$ <HI>$Word$ of Bac$n;</HI> the lo&s;s of which had $een a bo$e of contention ever &s;ince: but another, which H$men $Span$ on them, $Word$ every thing to $Word$; and they trudged away very lovingly toge|ther.</P>
<P>A prece&s;&s;ion of cottagers, preceded by a pipe and tabor, $Span$ with g$rlands, now arre&s;ted the general atten|tion. An old couple, apparently about &s;ixty, were intro|duced; who, app$$ac$$$ the throne of Hymen, told him the$ had been wedded forty years; that day was the anni|ver&s;ary of their union; and that, to prove how happy content and good-humour had made them all that time, they were come to $$now their $ows. Hymen, with a look of mo$t gracious approbation, placed an ama$anthine wreath on each of their heads; and the ceremony began with an offering of incen&s;e &s;o fragrant, that it's po$gnancy deprived me of &s;en&s;ation. After a momentary &s;u&s;pention of ideas, I found my&s;elf in my chamber; and a waggi&s;h $Span$ by my bed &s;ide, in the act of awakening me by the application of a bottle of &s;alts to my no&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A MORAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>SWEET as the voice of the &s;yren is the language of &s;en&s;ibility; &s;oft as the a&s;pect of nature, when the ge|nius of &s;torms meditates, in $$$ence, a tumultuous de&s;cent: but oft, like the pre$u$ive calm, it contains the &s;eeds of mi&s;chief; and, like the harmony of the &s;yren, &s;hould be heard with di&s;tru&s;t. As the delightful beverage of the vineyard, it attunes the heart to the mo&s;t generous and &s;alutary affections: but, with that, &s;teals in$en&s;ibly on the imagination; and, unle&s;s tempered by the according hand of D$$e$etion, deba&s;es where it &s;hould refine, and enner|vates where it &s;hould confirm.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ibility, though undoubtly propitious to virtue, like all excellences, has it's counterfeit; and, when carried to an extreme, degenerates into vice. The &s;pirit of Nature rejo$ces in equa$$$ty; and prefers for her re&s;idence the bowers of &s;pring.</P>
<P>Phoebe Smith was the only, and darling, child of Cap|tain Smith; a military gentleman, who, having devoted the flower of his days to the honourable &s;ervice of his country, retired at fifty-&s;ix, crowned with the well-earned laurel, to a &s;mall family e&s;tate in Flint&s;hire. His avoca|tions were &s;uch as will naturally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to be mo&s;t eligible to a liberal and poli&s;hed mind. An union
<PB N="64" REF="64">
of thirty years had improved, rather than impaired, the affection of an amiable wife; and the dutiful demeanour of his daughter, founded on principle, was confirmed by parental tenderne&s;s. So entire a confidence, indeed, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between the members of this little family, that they might truly be &s;aid to experience that &s;ummit of terre&s;tial joy, dome&s;tick felicity. A chief trait in the character ef Phoebe was an ingenuous benevolence of heart; which, through judging of others by her&s;elf, induced her gene|rally to attribute more &s;incerity to mankind than common experience will authorize. She al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a delicate &s;en&s;ibility; which, by an immediate attachment to what is called Sentimental Literature, became &s;o exqui&s;itely re|fined, that her affections grew too chimerical to &s;atis&s;y, and her &s;olicitudes almo&s;t too poignant to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Her father witne&s;&s;ed this perver&s;ion of her mind with no little anxiety; but, in his attempts to reclaim her, aver&s;e to har&s;hne&s;s, only took the mild methods of remon|&s;trance and rea&s;oning. "My dear Phoebe," would he &s;ay, "Sen&s;ibility is the offspring of Humanity; and, con&s;equently, ought to be cheri&s;hed: but let us be care|ful that the methods we take to improve, do not corrupt it. Too much indulgence is as detrimental as total neg|lect. Whenever we refine our ideas and affections to &s;uch a degree that the former cannot be reduced to practice, and the latter revolts at co-operating with the claims of &s;ociety, there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that we have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the ordinances of Nature; for virtue di&s;claims u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculation, and &s;ociety can only be benefitted by alacrity and per&s;everance. I am afraid, that the world has more to dread, on the &s;core of degeneracy, from tho&s;e who &s;tile them&s;elves Sentimental Writers, than we are $Word$ to conceive. The genuine effu&s;ions of hone&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, are of &s;ervice to morality; but if we allow our&s;elves to be affected by the quaint bomba&s;t of a di&s;tempered fancy, or the querulous detail of a di&s;&s;atisfied mind; we &s;hall, in all probability, imbibe the euthu&s;ia&s;m of the one, and the peevi&s;hne&s;s of the other. When the mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;trength to di&s;criminate, and coolne&s;s to examine, little danger need be apprehended; but as the credulous impetuo&s;ity of youth often produces improper confidences, and fatal de|ci&s;ions; and as we are always liable to be mi&s;led, through

the arts of the de&s;igning, and the &s;pecious arguments of infatuated error; it is certainly mo&s;t advi&s;eable, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to con&s;ult experience for information, before we form conclu&s;ions, o$ meditate pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>"Do not imagine that I would cu$tail your plea&s;ures, I only with to direct them to a proper channel; and I think it my duty to w$$$ you again&s;t the inconventences you are likely to &s;uffer from an intemperate pa&s;&s;ion for a &s;pecies of writing, generally captivating, but rarely natu|ral; con&s;equently, calculated chiefly to affect our happi|ne&s;s by vitiating our morals."</P>
<P>Phoebe was nineteen, when En&s;ign Medhur&s;t, &s;on to an old &s;choolfellow of the Captain's, came down to pals a few weeks with our little family. He was a young man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many accompli&s;hments, but d$&s;t$tute of prin|ciple. He had never &s;een Phoebe before; and had not been long acquanted with her, before he re&s;olved to repay the ho&s;pitality of the father by the ruin of the daughter. Active ob&s;ervation &s;oon informed him of her ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and, by flattering this, he promi&s;ed him&s;elf the attainment of his wi&s;h. Every one much conver&s;ant with &s;entimental novels, will readily conceive the methods which he took; and, from the &s;ame intelligence, will pro|bably anticipate the cata&s;trophe! His de&s;ign accompli&s;h|ed, Medhur&s;t, on a preconcerted &s;cheme, took his leave at the villa &s;ooner than was expected; but &s;ucceeded in con|&s;oling the heart-breaking Phoebe, by a&s;&s;uring her, that the moment he had &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s which unexpect|edly called him away, he would a&s;&s;uredly return, and a&s;k her hand of her father, being certain, as he &s;aid, of ob|taining that of his own.</P>
<P>Three months, however, pa&s;&s;ed without her &s;eeing him; it is true, that he had twice written to her, from motives of policy, and this kept hope alive in her brea&s;t; nor was it till the expiration of that period, when &s;he heard of his being married in London, that her eyes were commpleatly open to his villiany, and her own &s;hame. The&s;e circum|&s;tances operated &s;o &s;everely on her mind, as to throw her into a mo&s;t violent fever; out of which &s;he aro&s;e, after more than two months, an emaciated object of lunacy!</P>
<P>It was now, from her emphatick incoherencies, that the d$a$ing parents fir&s;t gathered the occa&s;ion of their
<PB N="66" REF="66">
daughter's malady, and a knowledge of the wretch who had betrayed her. To attempt at de&s;cribing the father's agonies, would be affectation; for the mother's, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that &s;he fell an immediate victim to them!</P>
<P>But for the interference of an intimate friend of the Captain, he had &s;et off immediately to London, to have &s;acrificed Medhur&s;t to the manes of his wife, and an ex|piatory offering for the indi&s;cretion of his child. This gentleman repre&s;ented, that he was altogether unworthy of death in&s;&s;icted by the hand of a man of honour; re|commended him, for his child's &s;ake, not to ri&s;k his own life; and a&s;&s;ured him, that he would exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, in bringing that villain to as condign a puni&s;h|ment as the law would allow.</P>
<P>The wretched parent &s;eemed &s;atisfied with the&s;e a&s;|&s;urances, and endeavoured to appear compo&s;ed; but his flattering appearance was like that of Etna, who&s;e &s;ides are covered with verdure, while fires prey on it's entrails.</P>
<P>He had fully determined, in his own mind, to avenge his wrongs more effectually than the law would admit: for this purpo&s;e, unknown to his friend, he &s;ent a pre&s;&s;ing invita|tion to old Medhur&s;t and his &s;on, which he begged they would comply with as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Frank, who had every thing to dread, made every excu&s;e he rea&s;onably could; but as his father was very partial to the Captain, he in&s;i&s;ted on his compliance, and they &s;et off together.</P>
<P>On their arrival, they were &s;hewn into the parlour; where the Captain &s;at, with his friend, who was &s;urprized at their unexpected appearance. Mr. Medhur&s;t, after the fir&s;t &s;alutation, which he thought rather cool, enquired for Mrs. Smith, and Phoebe, and the rea&s;on why the fa|mily were in mourning. The Captain, with a deep &s;igh, an&s;wered, that his wife was no more; and intreated their company, with that of his friend, to vi&s;it Phoebe, whom they would find in the garden.</P>
<P>She was now in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate, as &s;carcely to re|member the features of any one; and, when they di&s;co|vered her, &s;he was &s;itting in the very bower where &s;he had fir&s;t li&s;tened to her betrayer. Frank trembled at the ap|proach, and &s;hrunk back behind his father. She did not perceive them till they were clo&s;e to the entrance.&mdash;"Hu&s;h!" &s;he cried, "you've frightened him away; and
<PB N="67" REF="67">
he was &s;aying the &s;weete&s;t things! he knelt there; and when he &s;aid <HI>he loved me,</HI> oh! how the tears ran down his cheeks&mdash;and my heart &s;o fluttered&mdash;yes, he talked &s;o charmingly&mdash;but, there, I've a &s;ad memory."&mdash;Then ta|king up the remains of a ro&s;e, the leaves of which &s;he had &s;cattered on the ground, and looking wi&s;tfully on her fa|ther&mdash;"This was a pretty ro&s;e once!"&mdash;So &s;triking an emblem of her&s;elf, heightened by the uncon&s;cious man|ner in which &s;he uttered it, operated with full force on the parent. He hid his face for a moment; and then, recol|lecting him&s;elf, re-a&s;&s;umed his previous &s;ternne&s;s. At this moment, Frank, by altering his po&s;ition, caught the eye of the afflicted girl; &s;he &s;urveyed him &s;ome time, with a &s;ort of confu&s;ed terror; then, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, left the bower, and walked precipitately to the hou&s;e. Their eyes followed till they lo&s;t &s;ight of her, when the Captain thus addre&s;&s;ed them&mdash;"The entertainment I have pro|vided for you is a melancholy one, but nece&s;&s;ity demands it; the fate of that unhappy girl was the death of her mo|ther!'&mdash;Here he drew his hand acro&s;s his eyes&mdash;"and her mi&s;ery was occa&s;ioned by a wretch who, while he eat at my table, planned the ruin of my child." Then, turning to Frank&mdash;"Do I &s;peak fal&s;ely?" Hardened as he was in vice, the contemptible culprit hung his head, incapable either of denying the accu&s;ation, or of offering the &s;malle&s;t excu&s;e, while his father &s;tood confounded with wonder and horror. But the &s;ilence of a few moments was inter|rupted by the Captain; who, drawing a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols from his pocket, pre&s;ented one to young Medhur&s;t. "There, Sir, Would to God you had dealt as ju&s;tly with me!" The father and the friend interfered in vain: the Captain was determined, they mea&s;ured paces, and the &s;educer fell. It were needle&s;s to dwell on the en&s;uing &s;cene. Mr. Medhur&s;t applied to the bar of criminal ju|ri&s;diction for redre&s;s. The Captain re&s;igned him&s;elf with chearfulne&s;s; and, being found guilty of murder, heard with great firmne&s;s, &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed on him.</P>
<P>The very peculiar circum&s;tances of his ca&s;e, however, together with the recollection of his profe&s;&s;ional &s;ervices, procured him the Royal mercy. But, though re&s;tored to &s;ociety, he was not &s;o to him&s;elf. He buried Phoebe &s;oon after; &s;old his e&s;tate; and, retiring to one of the mo&s;t re|mote

<HEAD>ESSAY, ACCOUNTING FOR OUR DISPOSITIONS AND CHARACTERS, FROM CORRESPONDING QUALITIES IN MINERAL NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>AMUSING my&s;elf, lately, with Ovid's fiction of the renovation of mankind, after the flood, by Deu|calion and Pyrrha; it occured to me, that the allegory might be extended much farther, and not unprofitably; by accounting for every different &s;pecies of men, from the &s;uppo&s;itions of their being the productions of &s;uch &s;tones, or mineral &s;ub&s;tances, as may &s;eem mo&s;t analagous to then re&s;pective natures.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="69">
To effect a proper a&s;&s;imilation of this idea, it mu&s;t be $Word$, that $Word$ of the mi$acle are enabled, by the &s;uperior Power, to command proportionate quantities of all the various minerals, $o&s;&s;$ls, calculous concretions, o$es, gems, and p$$rified &s;ub&s;tances, either concealed in the bowels of the earth, or depo&s;ited in the profound beds of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>We may, then, without the &s;malle&s;t embar$$&s;&s;ment, proceed to a$$rm, that wherever a piece of <HI>marble,</HI> or <HI>alaba&s;ter,</HI> was thrown, there aro$e a being, whether male or female, of a fair and &s;pecious external; hard hearted, and in&s;en&s;ible to every tender impre&s;&s;ion: while &s;oft <HI>chalky &s;ub&s;tances</HI> nece&s;&s;arily produced characters ea&s;ily moulded into any form; yielding, alike, to the cha&s;te de&s;igns of Wi&s;dom, o$ the wild cap$ice of F$lly. From the <HI>copper $re</HI> may be derived th$&s;e of a co$roding nature: the en|vious, the malevolent, all retailers of &s;lander, and other pe$nicious underm$ners of our felicity. From <HI>iron,</HI> the in|trepid and hardy; as, warr$ors, an$ per&s;ons remarkably tenacious of their rights, and aver&s;e to flexibility; to fa|miliarize and refine whom, requires the united efforts of enduring time and per&s;e$$$ing labour, &s;imilar to what is nece&s;&s;ary to produce, from this metal, it's ela&s;tick and poli&s;hed offspring, <HI>&s;teel.</HI> From <HI>lead</HI> we may expect the &s;aturnine and gro&s;s; the bigotted devotee, the &s;ervile gro|veller, and the phlegmatick boor.</P>
<P><HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>&s;ilver,</HI> it may be pre&s;umed, gave birth to poets, hi&s;torians, aru&s;ts, and all other de&s;criptions of ex|alted characters; who&s;e labours, the effect of genius, are of &s;terling value; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power to enrich, refine, and improve mankind. At the fir&s;t view, I was tempt|ed to deduce the origin of the mi&s;er from the &s;ame &s;ource; but it &s;oon occurred, that his origin might more rea&s;onably be imputed to that &s;pecies of <HI>coal</HI> frequently found en|cru&s;ted with a &s;emblance of the&s;e valuable metals, acquired by means with which the wi&s;e&s;t characters are wholly unacquainted: and this &s;emblance &s;till more forcibly &s;trikes us, when we reflect that, from this mineral, like the character alluded to, there is no advantage derivable till it's di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>In the mariner, we may trace a &s;imilitude to the <HI>coral;</HI> authorized by the uncommon firmne&s;s of both, and their thriving be&s;t in their native element.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="70">
The various de&s;criptions of gems, and precious &s;tones, afford numerous examples to illu&s;trate our theory.</P>
<P>The tran&s;parency of the <HI>chry&s;tal</HI> be us an apt re&s;em|blance to openne&s;s and candom of &s;entiment; the delicate violet of the <HI>amethr&s;t,</HI> pre&s;ents an agreeable feature of un|affected mode&s;ty, generally inherent in a character of real merit; the <HI>&s;apphire</HI>$s blue, an idea of that heavenly &s;$|renity of mind accompanying a cour&s;e of virtue; the bright green of the <HI>emerald,</HI> a lively temper, connected with &s;olidity of mind; the rich yellow of the <HI>topaz,</HI> the mellow or &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition uncorrupted by exce&s;s; and the glowing red of the <HI>ruby,</HI> zeal for religion, finely tem|pered by the according power of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The <HI>pearl</HI> &s;heds the precious &s;eeds of tho&s;e amiable and &s;ilent virtues, which exi&s;t rarely but in private life; and which are only pre&s;erved by avoiding a too familiar inter|cour&s;e with the world, their purity being ea&s;ily &s;ullied: &s;uch as adorn the cha&s;te virgin, the faithful wife, the ten|der mother, and the amiable friend.</P>
<P>The <HI>diamond</HI> is ju&s;tly allowed pre-eminence, as well for brilliancy of appearance, as &s;olidity of worth; we mu&s;t, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily attach to it that character, the innate &s;plendour and value of which reflects brightne&s;s on the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed appointment; who&s;e worth is incapable of material diminution, from the humble&s;t &s;ituation; and who&s;e firmne&s;s, calculated to bear even the &s;evere&s;t ardour of per&s;ecution with the mo&s;t admirable fortitude, emulates the diamond, that endures, unimpaired in value, the mo&s;t extreme heat of fire.</P>
<P>But, le&s;t the diamond &s;hould &s;eem to pre&s;ent us with too perfect a character for the &s;phere of morality, it may be requi&s;ite to examine it's weak &s;ide. Like the mo&s;t &s;u|perlative characters in life, it has it's flaws; and there is a po&s;&s;ibility of deba&s;ing it &s;o far, as to render it ab&s;olutely worthle&s;s. If thrown into cold water immediately on being extracted from a fierce fire, in which it has laid till thoroughly heated; it is &s;aid to &s;eparate into thin pieces, re&s;embling tale, and to be equally de&s;icient in tra&s;pa|rency: ju&s;t as the mo&s;t virtuous man, after nobly under|going the mo&s;t violent per&s;ecution, may be &s;o far &s;educed by the flattery of the world, of which water, as the emblem of deceit, is here to be con&s;idered the type, as to be &s;ub|jugated
<PB N="71" REF="71">
by degeneracy; and have his genuine glory and merit entirely obliterated.</P>
<P>There are many other mineral productions equally &s;u&s;|ceptible of application; but, having already procured &s;uf|ficient to convey a general idea, I &s;hall conclude my meta|phor, by averring the wit to have originally &s;prung from <HI>quick&s;ilver;</HI> the critick from the <HI>touch&s;tone,</HI> on which the qualities of metals are tried; and the good divine from the <HI>magnet,</HI> or <HI>load&s;tone,</HI> as &s;till leading to the grand point, by it's irre&s;i&s;tible power of attraction. Beauty may, per|haps, profe&s;s it&s;elf an emanation; and, if it be that <HI>real</HI> beauty, which ari&s;es from virtue and genuine mode&s;ty; combined with an ea&s;y and affable carriage; the claim mu&s;t not be di&s;avowed: but if merely that which is compo&s;ed of a fine form, poli&s;hed &s;kin, white teeth, and regular fea|tures, unaided by mental graces; I boldly affirm &s;uch me|retricious charmers; with the whole &s;warm of fal&s;e wits, beaux, coquettes, and other trifling and inde&s;cribable human in&s;ects; to be generated from counterfeit gems, variegated &s;hells and pebbles; together with the exten&s;ive collection of &s;trange and unaccountable p$trefactions, aber|rations and mon&s;tro&s;ities of nature, &s;o frequently met with by every curious re&s;earcher. I mu&s;t not, however, unite with the cruelty and inju&s;tice of the world, by neglecting that re&s;pectable and &s;elect cla&s;s of &s;ociety, the Old Maids&mdash;who are &s;o indeed&mdash;and whom I feel inclined to derive from that rare and very curious natural production, the <HI>a&s;be&s;tos:</HI> which, though of a texture delicate in the ex|treme, remains uncon&s;umed amid&s;t the fierce&s;t fire; yet, does not appear in the &s;malle&s;t degree u&s;eful to &s;ociety; more, perhaps, from man's want of pe$$$ration to di&s;co|cover and apply it's valuable qualitites, than from any in|herent defect of it's own.</P>
<P>An in&s;tructive moral may be deduced from this allegory. Had the world been actually repeopled in the manner re|lated by Ovid, and the con&s;equences proved &s;uch as I have ju&s;t repre&s;ented, there would then have been &s;ome degree of con&s;i&s;tency in one man's $Word$ him&s;elf naturally &s;uperior to another; and, con&s;equently, &s;ome excu&s;e for pride. The offspring of a jewel might rea&s;onably have concluded him&s;elf of more con&s;equence than any metalick production whatever, and the &s;everal branches of the va|rious
<PB N="72" REF="72">
metals, and other natural productions of the earth, have valued them&s;elves in proportion to the purity of their parental qualities; or the degrees of e&s;timation imputed to them as more or le&s;s beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>But as all were, in reality, originally formed from the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, mere earth; how ludicrous is it for any individual to appear inflated with ideas of con&s;cious &s;elf-importance, and ab&s;urdly imagine them&s;elves &s;omething &s;uperior to the general &s;tandard of mortality! The mo&s;t minute and in&s;ignificant object in creation has a purpo&s;e a&s;&s;igned it, and an effect to accompli&s;h; and, undoubtedly, every human being has &s;ome peculiar advantage, or qua|lification, by which he may render him&s;elf u&s;eful to &s;o|ciety. He, therefore, that improves the talent given; and, exerci&s;ing it for general benefit, renders to the community the duty that he owes it from the nature of a &s;ocial com|pact, is, in the eye of rea&s;on, on an equal footing with it's worthie&s;t members: for true greatne&s;s is not implicated in any particularity of &s;tation; but con&s;i&s;ts in the manner of di&s;charging the delegated tru&s;t, and in the degree contri|buted towards the publick welfare. None, in fact, can ju&s;tly be denominated mean, but the churli&s;h, the &s;en&s;ual, and the &s;lothful.</P>

<P>WHEN Muley Mu&s;tapha &s;wayed the Ottoman Em|pire, lived Ali and Ora&s;min, &s;ons of two mo&s;t eminent Lords in the court of Amurath his father: they were born on the &s;ame day; had been companions from infancy; contemplated together the &s;tupendous beauties of Nature; &s;crutinized the complicated labyrinths of Knowledge; cultivated the heroick di&s;cipline of War; and courted the irre&s;i&s;tible Graces calculated to meliorate the ruggedne&s;s of the &s;oldier, and familiarize the pedan|tick &s;tiffne&s;s of the &s;cholar; poli&s;h the invaluable precepts of Wi&s;dom, and make even Virtue's &s;elf more divine. It was determined at their births, by the Genii of Excellence, that All &s;hould &s;urpa&s;s Ora&s;min in beauty of per&s;on, &s;trength of body, and vigour of mind; and, though the latter apparently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the candour and genero&s;ity of the former, he was in reality &s;ubtle and &s;elfi&s;h; jealous of merit, and impatient of &s;uperiority: yet the &s;acred zone of friend&s;hip was mutually exchanged between them, and they were the &s;ole confidants of each other.</P>
<P>A &s;oil &s;o ungrateful as the brea&s;t of Ora&s;min was little propitious to the &s;eeds of amity; e&s;pecially as increa&s;ing maturity confirmed proportionately the unkind bias of nature. In all their emulatory exerci&s;es, the $reath of victory was the boon of Ali, who wore it with the mo&s;t conciliating demeanour: but nothing could reconcile O|ra&s;min to repeated di&s;appointment; continual defeat in|crea&s;ed his chagrin; his friend&s;hip daily &s;ub&s;ided; he had
<PB N="75" REF="75">
recour&s;e to &s;tratagem for triumph, but the re&s;ult was ever accumulated mortification; till, at length, envy took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his brea&s;t, and was by a mo&s;t important occur|rence &s;ublimed into a de&s;ire of revenge.</P>
<P>Of Amine, the beautiful and virtuous daughter of the Vizier Omar, they were both enamoured; and both &s;ought her affections, though unknown to each other: but the tali&s;man of Fortune was in the hand of Ali; and, by con&s;ent of the vizier, the cadi drew up the contract of union between them. Ora&s;min attended the celebration of his friend's nuptials; but, while he prayed aloud that Alla might &s;hower down innumerable ble&s;&s;ings on his head, he cur&s;ed him in his heart, and from that moment meditated his de&s;truction. But his re&s;entment he veiled under the garb of extreme &s;olicitude; and, while on his lips dwelt the mellifluous accents of di&s;intere&s;ted profe&s;|&s;ion, the deadly gall of hatred rankled in his &s;oul. Lo! to the eye, how beautiful appears the &s;erpent of the de&s;art; yet in his mouth is inferted a barbed &s;ting, and under his tongue is collected the dark beverage of death!</P>
<P>Ora&s;min, now &s;tedfa&s;t in his hate, waited with the ut|mo&s;t anxiety for a favourable moment to effect his mon|&s;trous purpo&s;es on his rival, as the tawny lion of Africa watches an opportunity to &s;pring on his prey: but the hopes of the envious were vain; the conduct of Ali put Scandal to &s;hame, and bade defiance to the machinations of Malice.</P>
<P>The pure bli&s;s which the new-married couple enjoyed, was in the fulne&s;s of time heightened extremely by the birth of a &s;on: but it is written in the ample book of Na|ture&mdash;"That the faire&s;t blo&s;&s;om &s;hall be blighted, and the green leaf &s;hall not la&s;t for ever;" and, in the unutterable volume of De&s;tiny, that&mdash;"The a&s;pect of human happine&s;s is deceitful as the complexion&punc; of the &s;ky; and that the exqui&s;ite &s;ea&s;on of enjoyment flees away on the light pi|nions of impatience." The &s;on of Amine was &s;tolen from his nur&s;e; and the hou&s;e of Ali, from being the man&s;ion of &s;upreme felicity, became, on a &s;udden, the dwelling of angui&s;h, and the haunt of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>An hundred moons had revolved, and Ali and Amine heard not of their fir&s;t-born; neither did the all-wi&s;e Alla think fit to &s;upply his place by another. At length, Ali
<PB N="76" REF="76">
was di&s;patched on an expedition again&s;t the enemies of the faithful; and Ora&s;min had the mortification to &s;erve under him, as &s;econd in command. He re&s;olved to thwart him all he could in&s;idiou&s;ly: and, by a well-concerted &s;tratagem, and mo&s;t con&s;ummate addre&s;s, made &s;o grand a diver&s;ion in favour of the foe, that the Mu&s;&s;ulmen were not only defeated; but, apparently to the whole army, through the imbecility of the commander in chief, who narrowly e&s;caped being made pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The &s;agacious Ali, however, though he little &s;u&s;pected the treachery of Ora&s;min, knew well where the blame lay; yet, rather than his friend &s;hould &s;uffer, nobly cho&s;e to keep &s;ilence, and him&s;elf bear the whole weight of the Sultan's di&s;plea&s;ure. The perfidious Ora&s;min, internally rejoicing at the effect of his art, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure received the news, that the generous Ali was bani&s;hed his &s;overeign's pre&s;ence, and had retired to hide his &s;hame far from the royal city. Time, however, and the intere&s;t of Omar, once more re&s;tored Ali to Mu&s;tapha's favour: he was entru&s;ted, in a full divan, with an emba&s;&s;y to the Chri&s;tian &s;tates; and returned, after having concluded his mi&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t honourable manner. But it &s;hould &s;eem that the Genii of Pro&s;perity had re&s;igned his de&s;tiny to the Spirits of Malediction; the &s;ublime &s;atisfaction he received from the approving &s;miles of his royal ma&s;ter, were bla&s;ted by the intelligence that Amine, the wife of his bo&s;om, was no more! At his departure, &s;he had retired to a hou&s;e which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea-&s;hore; and it was her cu&s;tom every evening to ramble among the rocks, as if to look for his return, from one of the&s;e excur&s;ions &s;he never returned; and her attendants concluded that &s;he mu&s;t have been drowned. Ali was di&s;tracted at the in|formation, and flew from &s;ociety to bury his grief in &s;ympathizing &s;olitude. In the mean time, partly through &s;orrowing for his daughter, and partly through the dila|pi$lations of time, the venerable Omar re&s;igned his &s;eat of mortality; and Ora&s;min, by mere intrigue, obtained the po&s;t of temporary Vizier; as Mu&s;tapha had proclaimed, that no one &s;hould be confirmed in it, but he who &s;hould perform an action worthy of &s;uch a reward.</P>
<P>Ora&s;min, however, through the mo&s;t refined artifice, had almo&s;t induced the Sultan to perpetuate his claim to the
<PB N="77" REF="77">
vizier&s;hip; when Nadar I&s;moul, with a formidable army, approached, with all the in&s;olence of a rebel, within two day's march of the royal capital. The voice of rebellion pierced the rece&s;&s;es of grief; and Ali, rouzed from his de|&s;ponding lethargy by the imminent danger of his country, ha&s;tened to court; and, throwing him&s;elf at the Sultan's feet, entreated leave to march again&s;t Nadar, and retrieve his former di&s;honour. Muley readily complied; and Ali took the field with a le&s;s, but a much better di&s;ciplined army than that of Nadar: victory &s;trode before him; the deluded forces of the traitor threw down their arms, but it was the will of Alla that their leader &s;hould e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The acclamations of thou&s;ands proclaimed the honour|able return of Ali; and Ora&s;min, making a virtue of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, was the fir&s;t to declare him worthy of the vizier&s;hip. He at fir&s;t he&s;itated to accept it, for the memory of Amine had e&s;tranged his heart from &s;ociety; but, reflecting that man was not made for him&s;elf, and that he who &s;lights the power of doing good, is an enemy to human nature, he received it at the hands of his gracious &s;overeign with the mo&s;t zealous and heart-felt profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude. The torments of Ora&s;min increa&s;ed daily; and, though he ob&s;erved the mo&s;t marked attention to his rival outwardly, the dark projects of revenge continually ab&s;orbed his mind. An orphan, who from earlie&s;t infancy had been under his protection, loved, and was beloved by his daughter: he had long noticed it, but concealed that knowledge. One day, when the lovers were enjoying, as they thought, the bli&s;&s;es of &s;ecurity, he &s;urprized them, and with a &s;tern frown bade Ibrahim follow him. They entered a private apartment; when Ora&s;min, &s;eating him&s;elf, thus addre&s;&s;ed the youth, who &s;tood trembling before him&mdash;"Ibrahim, when the Angel of Death deprived thee of thy parents, and the Angel of Adver&s;ity de&s;troyed the fortunes of thine hou&s;e, thou wa&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of thy lo&s;s. Thy father had been my mo&s;t intimate friend, and I took thee under my protection. I have been to thee as a father, and thou ha&s;t been profu&s;e in profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude; but it is by deeds alone that we can judge of the &s;incerity of the heart, and Ora&s;min now finds it nece&s;&s;ary to put thy gratitude to trial." Then, giving him a letter, bade him read it;
<PB N="78" REF="78">
which the terrified Ibrahim immediately opening, found to contain the&s;e words&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"Ali Mahomet, to his e&s;teemed friend, Nadar I&s;moul; greeting, health and happine&s;s! To the tyrant Mu&s;tapha de&s;pair and death! The plan of thy defeat was well ma|naged; the credulous Muley is compleatly deceived, and has made me Vizier: he little dreams that he has put him|&s;elf into the power of his mo&s;t implacable enemy. I di&s;|patch this by a tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger; by whom, from time to time, I &s;hall communicate to thee what &s;teps thou art to take. At pre&s;ent, keep &s;till where thou art; and I hope &s;oon to call thee from thy hiding-place; to &s;hare with me the empire of the u&s;urping Othmans. Thine, in all the ardour of &s;incerity,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"ALI MAHOMET."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"Among the talents thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t," continued Ora&s;min, "thou ha&s;t that of imitating, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of detection, the mo&s;t difficult hand-writing; tran&s;cribe, then, that letter in the characters of Ali our vizier, &s;pecimens of which I &s;hall give thee; and, if thou &s;uccede&s;t to my wi&s;h, the hand of my daughter Almeria, whom thou love&s;t, &s;hall be thine." The agitation of &s;urprize which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the youthful Ibrahim, left him not words to reply: he &s;tam|mered a few incoherent words; when Ora&s;min, drawing his &s;cymitar, cried&mdash;"I am not to be trifled with! to the ta&s;k this moment; or, by the head of Mahomet, thou &s;halt follow the &s;hade of thy father! But, I again repeat it, if thou plea&s;e&s;t me, Almeria &s;hall be thine to-morrow."</P>
<P>Flattered by the hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Almeria, but more through fear at the threats of Ora&s;min, Ibrahim &s;at down, without a thought of the con&s;equences which might en&s;ue, to imitate the trea&s;onous &s;croll. The mon&s;ter who com|pelled him to the action, was delighted with his perfor|mance: and calling for &s;herbet, he drank, telling Ibrahim to pledge him; then, bidding him good night with a &s;ar|ca&s;tical &s;mile, and &s;ecuring the door when he went, left him in a mo&s;t painful reverie.</P>
<P>Repairing to the walls of the &s;eraglio, he entered by a private pa&s;&s;age, through which the Emperor always pa&s;&s;ed when wont to &s;urvey the royal city in di&s;gui&s;e; and which by having been vizier, he was well acquainted with: and having, while in office, procured fal&s;e keys to the various
<PB N="79" REF="79">
doors, he ea&s;ily found admi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ecret audience|chamber, where none but the vizier can enter on pain of death without permi&s;&s;ion of the Sultan; and, there leaving the letter, he returned to his hou&s;e, exulting in the hope that Mu&s;tapha would di&s;cover it, when he retired there alone, as was his cu&s;tom every night, to in&s;pect &s;uch di&s;|patches as the vizier in the day prepared for his approba|tion: tru&s;ting the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan on the extreme cre|dulity and impetuo&s;ity of that monarch, which hurried him into actions that provided him the mo&s;t &s;evere repentance for his moments of reflection.</P>
<P>The event ju&s;tified his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and, before the fir&s;t watch of the night was pa&s;&s;ed, a ha&s;ty me&s;&s;enger &s;ummoned him to a &s;ecret audience in the palace. The Sultan pre&s;ented him with the letter; he read it, and appeared petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment; com|pared the writing with &s;ome of Ali's he had purpo&s;ely brought with him, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf of it's identity; then, bemoaning the defalcation of his friend, in accents of the mo&s;t artfully counterfeited grief, and after an apparent &s;truggle between duty and friend&s;hip&mdash;"Glory," &s;aid he, "to God and his prophet! Long life to the Commander of the Faithful! and de&s;truction to his enemies! The pro|found duty every Mu&s;&s;ulman owes to the vicegerent of Alla, obliges me to di&s;pen&s;e with the &s;cruples of an ill|placed friend&s;hip; and declare, that the conduct of Ali has long appeared to me as involved in the veil of my&s;|tery: the plau&s;ible manner in which he has ever demeaned him&s;elf, I have di&s;covered, beyond a doubt, has been only a lure for popularity; too ardent a love for which is a certain criterion of unwarrantable ambition.</P>
<P>"I once had the mortification to witne&s;s the &s;hameful defeat of the Ottoman arms, under his command; I had then many rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect treachery: but the implicit confidence I, with the empire at large, put in him, made me di&s;credit my own &s;en&s;es; and it was the &s;ame infatua|tion which induced me to be the foremo&s;t in declaring him the mo&s;t eligible for the vizier&s;hip, when returned from meeting the rebel I&s;moul. Yet, when I reflect, in &s;ober rea&s;on, on the nature of that action, and behold the in|&s;urgents, though greatly &s;uperior in force, throwing down their arms almo&s;t without-the &s;hadow of re&s;i&s;tance; and
<PB N="80" REF="80">
their leader &s;uffered to e&s;cape; it impre&s;&s;es me as a &s;trong confirmation of the authenticity of this newly-di&s;covered in&s;trument of trea&s;on."&mdash;"Thou art right, Ora&s;min," interrupted the enraged Mu&s;tapha: "convey him in&s;tantly to a dungeon; and to-morrow's &s;un &s;hall behold inflicted on him the reward of his treachery!"&mdash;"Will it plea&s;e the gracious emblem of Alla," replied Ora&s;min, "to li&s;ten a moment longer, without anger, to his &s;lave; while he offers, as Alla him&s;elf can witne&s;s, the coun&s;el only dicta|ted by that un&s;haken attachment ever evinced by his hou&s;e to the renowned family of the Othmans?"&mdash;"Speak on, and fear not," returned Mu&s;tapha. Ora&s;min proceeded&mdash;"Thou knowe&s;t well, O glory of thy race! that Ali is the idol of the deluded multitude; and, &s;hould they behold h$$ going forth to execution, what de&s;perate &s;teps may not their blind attachment induce them to take for his pre&s;ervation? And a commotion once begun, as we know not how far the trea&s;on has &s;pread, may encourage hun|dreds of accomplices in the guilt to come forward; and, led by Nadar, who doubtle&s;s is at hand, induce the popu|lace to join the compact of trea&s;on, relea&s;e Ali, and &s;hake, perhaps, even the foundation of the Ottoman throne? Let policy, then, hid Ju&s;tice &s;trike this night; &s;o, the root of the confederacy being cut away, the branches &s;hall ne|ce&s;&s;arily wither; and, when to-morrow's &s;un &s;hall expo&s;e the traitor's head, branded with his crime, to the trembling people, thy &s;ubjects &s;hall be more firmly fixed in their obedience&mdash;taught by the aweful le&s;&s;on, that the mo&s;t ex|alted enemies of Mu&s;tapha are the fated victims of de|&s;truction!" He cea&s;ed. "By Mahomet! I &s;wear," re|joins the Sultan, "thy rea&s;ons are ju&s;t! See him in&s;tantly di&s;patched! Be this," pre&s;enting his ring, "thy warrant. Be gone!" Ora&s;min wanted not urging: he &s;eized Ali; but appeared not before him, till he beheld him extended on the floor of a loath&s;ome dungeon, &s;ecured by the pondrous manacles of inju&s;tice. On entering, having ordered the guard to withdraw&mdash;"Mahomet," &s;aid he, "is it my noble friend Ali I am commi&s;&s;ioned to guard? Can any wretch have accu&s;ed thee of a crime meriting &s;uch di&s;ho|nour! thou, who&s;e name &s;candal had not even dared to prophane? Alas! my friend! where will Oppre&s;&s;ion fini&s;h his career!"&mdash;"I know not, my dear Ora&s;min!" replied
<PB N="81" REF="81">
the injured Ali, half rai&s;ing him&s;elf, "my crime, nor mine accu&s;er: innocence, however, is my &s;upport; and, while thou art my gaoler, I &s;hall find plea&s;ure even in a pri&s;on!"&mdash;"Generous, noble Ali!" rejoined the brute, "what is it I do not feel for thee! Yet it were unkind to keep thee in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Know, then, that the abandoned wretch, who was the occa&s;ion of the foul di&s;grace thou endure&s;t, is no other than thy dear, thy beloved friend, Ora&s;min!"&mdash;"Ora&s;min! Ora&s;min!" with an accent of doubting horror, enquired the victim. "Yes!" returned the fiend, "<HI>thy</HI> Ora&s;min!" Ali &s;unk down &s;en&s;ele&s;s. On his recovering, Ora&s;min continued&mdash;"From the hour that early youth &s;ubmitted me to the &s;courgings of a peda|gogue, thou ha&s;t been my rival, and the name of Ora&s;|min has &s;hrunk before that of Ali. Thinke&s;t thou, that I could have a &s;pirit, and hear it? No! the childi&s;h weak|ne&s;&s;es of friend&s;hip I &s;oon got rid of; and, from the mo|ment thou deprived&s;t me of all hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;or|cere&s;s Amine, I determined on a revenge&mdash;not a common revenge; that was always at hand&mdash;I waited with all the patience of deliberate malignance, for a revenge worthy my hatred; and I have obtained it! I have accu&s;ed thee of trea&s;on; and, behold, this ring is my warrant for thy private murder! Murder! I &s;ay; for&mdash;O it delights my &s;oul to pronounce it&mdash;thou art innocent!"&mdash;"And mu&s;t I die innocent?" exclaimed the devoted Ali. "Yet thy will, O Alla! be done. What more have I to wi&s;h for on earth? I have lo&s;t my friend, my wife, and my child!"&mdash;"Friend," interrupted Ora&s;min, "thou never had&s;t! Thy wife and child&mdash;But, hold!&mdash;I came to torment, not to &s;atisfy thee!"&mdash;"Oh! Ora&s;min, what a conflict ha&s;t thou rai&s;ed in my bo&s;om! My wife and child! knowe&s;t thou any thing of them?" Ora&s;min &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly, "Speak, only &s;ay if thou knowe&s;t ought of them!"&mdash;"I will &s;ay nothing," replied he; "uncertainty will in|crea&s;e thy pangs. Prepare for death!&mdash;Slaves!" The door of the dungeon bur&s;t open, and pre&s;ented to their view Mu&s;tapha, Ibrahim, and Amine! "Secure that fiend!" cried the Sultan; and in&s;tantly Ora&s;min was loaded with chains. Ali and A mine were lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s in each other's arms; Ora&s;m'n a&s;&s;umed a de&s;perate fullene&s;s; the Sultan and Ibrahim &s;urveyed the whole in &s;ilence. "Alla!

Allla! Alla!" repeated the reviving Ali; "thou art merciful! thou art merciful!"&mdash;"My dear lord," in|terrupted Amine, "dreary have been the hours &s;ince we parted! O hear my ju&s;tification! While walking by the &s;ea-&s;ide, a band of men, ma&s;ked, be&s;et me; and, forcing me on a hor&s;e, carried me, blinfolded, I knew not where; for, when &s;uffered to remove the bandage, I was alone in a mean, gloomy apartment, the door of which was &s;ecured. There have I remained, in vain lamenting my fate; ig|norant of my opp$e&s;&s;or; and &s;eeing no one except a &s;lave, who put my food through a lattice daily, but never &s;poke; till this $ight I heard the voice of Ora&s;min in a tone of threat$$i$g. I li&s;tened; and di&s;covered, that he was com|pelling that generous youth, Ibrahim, to write a trea&s;on|ous $Span$ characters like yours. When I found Ora&s;|min was gone, I entreated the youth to liberate me: in|&s;t$ntly $Word$ opened a door into my apartment, &s;o artfully cont$$ed, that I had never before ob&s;erved it. I told him who I was, and begged him again to deliver me. He was &s;ho$ked; confirmed what I had over-heard, and pro|mi&s;ed to protect me. He di&s;covered, with indignation, that he him&s;elf was al&s;o pri&s;oner. After a long deliberation, and many fruitle&s;s attempts to force the door, at the pe$$l of our lives. we e&s;caped by a window into the garden. Here we had fre&s;h difficulties to encounter, and the fourth watch pa&s;&s;ed before we were quite at liberty.</P>
<P>"We &s;oon learned that you was impri&s;oned. Flying to the palace, our gracious Sultan admitted us to an audience, when we convinced him of the villainy of thy fal&s;e $$ned."&mdash;"And, behold me," interrupted the Sultan, "ready to do thee ju&s;tice, Ali; and inflict on that wretch the puni&s;hment which he had prepared for thee! for, by Alla's &s;elf I &s;wear, this night is his la&s;t!"&mdash;"My fate is ju&s;t!" &s;aid Ora&s;min, in a tone of penit$nce. "But, before I die, let me make what $$patati$n is in my power to the man I have injured. Behold, Ali, in Ibrahim, I re&s;tore thee thy long-lo&s;t &s;on!" Extreme was the a&s;toni&s;hment of all; and the rapture of Ali and Amme induced them to kneel for a pardon for the culprit. "A&s;k not a pardon," &s;aid Ora&s;min, "which mu&s;t &s;oon be repe$t$$! I &s;tole thy child &s;olely for the pur|po&s;es of revenge; though fortune, never till now, gave me an opportunity of making u&s;e of him equal to my wi&s;hes;

and, to make him the &s;ource of his father's death, was a &s;troke worthy the noble&s;t policy of vengeance. Thou ha&s;t e&s;caped me; but, to give him thus kindly, were an mequa|lity of &s;oul, poor indeed! No; I have pangs for thee yet in &s;tore, the thought of which makes the contemplation of death and tortures plea&s;ant to me. I only revealed him to thee to make thee feel the cur&s;es of la&s;ting &s;eparation. The mother once di&s;damed the offer I made of my hand; it was my intention, therefore, to have kept her ignorant of her per&s;ecutor, langui&s;hing till grief and de&s;pair removed her from my reach: but the boy had an&s;wered the end I de&s;igned him for: I wanted him no more; and, at liberty, he might have betrayed me. For &s;ecurity, I gave him poi|&s;on in &s;herbet; and thought, even had he got free, &s;o &s;trong it was, that it would have worked fa&s;ter than his con&s;cience!"&mdash;"The vengeance be on thine own head!" cried Ibrahim; "for it was thy&s;elf who drank the poi&s;on. I &s;aw thee drop &s;omething in the draught intended for me; and, un&s;een by thee, changed the cups."</P>
<P>"I feel it! I feel it!" exclaimed the frantick Ora&s;min. "Cur&s;e on thee, Mahomet! thou ha&s;t fru&s;t$ated all!"&mdash;"Hence with him!" &s;aid Mu&s;tapha; and then led Ali, A|mine, and Ibrahim, out of the pri&s;on. By permi&s;&s;ion of the Sultan, Ibrahim was united to Almeria; and the partici|pation of her hu&s;band's honours, who was re&s;tored to his vizier&s;hip, amply recompenced Amine for all her &s;orrows.</P>
<P>An exemplary in&s;tance of gratitude towards Alla and the Sultan&mdash;towards the latter, by faithful coun&s;el, and &s;teady attachment to his intere&s;t; and, towards the for|mer, by an uniform cour&s;e of piety, and a con&s;cientious di&s;pen&s;ation of ju&s;tice and benevolence to his fellow &s;ub|jects&mdash;Ali lived long, beloved, and happy. As it is writ|ten in the &s;acred tablets of Truth&mdash;"The righteous &s;hall dwell in the tents of gladne&s;s, and the merciful in the gardens of peace: while the wicked &s;hall be covered with &s;hame; and the envious man &s;hall be con&s;umed in the fire which he kindleth for his neighbour."</P>

<HEAD>THE VISION OF HASSAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>AN ORIENTAL TALE.</HEAD>
<P>HASSAN, the merchant, having, through the favour of Alla, and an unexampled indu&s;try, accumulated an immen$e fortune, in the prime of life, declined the fa|tigues of commerce for the luxury of &s;plendor, and the enjoyment of ea&s;e.</P>
<P>His palace &s;eemed the &s;eat of enchantment; his haram was filled with the choice&s;t beauties, and his banquets were worthy a potentate. The &s;ounds of mu&s;ick and dancing were continually heard in his hall; all who came were welcome; and the re&s;idence of Ha&s;&s;an was &s;ignalized by the appellation of the <HI>Man&s;ion of Ho&s;pitality.</HI> Every one bowed as he pa&s;&s;ed; his name was celebrated in &s;ongs; and the prayers of the poor were continually offered up for his welfare. Every thing about him wore the ap|pearance of felicity; his &s;uperiors counted him; his equals flattered and envied him; and his inferiors &s;ought his pa|tronage, in preference to that of princes. All were a&s;to|ni&s;hed at his magnificence, and all united in pronouncing him <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>But Ha&s;&s;an was an in&s;tance, that the e&s;timates of mor|tals are generally erroneous. On a &s;udden, an extreme languor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him. He found not plea&s;ure among his women; retired from the banquet di&s;gu&s;ted; and heard the voice of adulation unmoved. Mu&s;ick could no longer $ull him to repo&s;e; he was ab&s;ent by day, and re&s;tle&s;s by night. In vain he affected the alacrity of chearfulne&s;s; for
<PB N="86" REF="86">
his countenance di&s;played the &s;ettled gloom of melancholy and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, reclined on his &s;ofa, he was ruminating on the uncertainty and &s;ubtlety of happine&s;s; when he was alarmed by a violent clap of thunder, and in a moment a &s;upernatural Form &s;tood before him.</P>
<P>"Ha&s;&s;an," &s;aid the Spirit, in an encouraging tone, "attend! I am the Genius of In&s;truction; the bountiful and omni&s;cient Alla has &s;een thy di&s;&s;atisfaction, and has permitted me to direct thee in thy &s;earch after happine&s;s&punc; Mark well what is before thee!"</P>
<P>A plain, bordered on each &s;ide by a thick wood, and en|chantingly diver&s;ified with fruit-trees and flowers, was ex|tended to his view; &s;o large, that a temple at the farther end was &s;carcely di&s;cernible, to which a numerous quan|tity of children, who in&s;tantly made their appearance, were directed by a venerable per&s;onage; and warned again&s;t turning out of the path, or &s;topping by the way, excepting to refre&s;h them&s;elves with the fruits or flowers growing immediately on it's borders; which they were allowed to do, as the journey was long and al&s;o fatiguing, in con&s;e|quence of bogs and brambles frequently ob&s;tructing the way.</P>
<P>The majority, however, in&s;tead of attending to the in|junction, di&s;per&s;ed at random over the plain, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with juvenile &s;ports; &s;ome too gathered no&s;e|gays, while others culled the mo&s;t beautiful flowers to ornament their hair; and &s;ome greedily devoured the va|rious fruits, while others filled their pockets with them. Many, neverthele&s;s, &s;eemed to obey the command given them. But the greater part of the&s;e were &s;educed from the path, at various &s;tages of the journey: &s;ome, to go over to former companions; others, attracted by the luxuriant appearance of &s;ome particular &s;pecies of fruit, or the variegated tints of a glaring flower; and few, in|deed, were they who reached the temple. The&s;e had fear$el$ entered, when from the two woods ru&s;hed out a large troop of bea&s;ts of prey, while the air darkened with innumerable de&s;cending vultures and every other de&s;crip|tion of carnivorous birds. They immediately attacked the juvenile multitude; who, defencele&s;s as they all were, fled every way to avoid them. A few took refuge in a mi&s;erable
<PB N="87" REF="87">
hovel, on the right &s;ide of the plain; and many &s;ought the woods, whither they were in&s;tantly pur&s;ued. Of tho&s;e who could not e&s;cape, &s;ome were left dead on the plain; others &s;hockingly mangled, on whom the birds and &s;maller bea&s;ts began immediately to glut their carnivorous appetites, while the larger bea&s;ts dragged their unfortunate victims into the woods, to devour them, at lei&s;ure, in their dens.</P>
<P>"What means," exclaim$d the a&s;toni&s;hed Ha&s;&s;an, "the &s;cene before me?"&mdash;"What thou ha&s;t &s;een," re|plied the Genius, "is a picture of human life; the plain is the world, and the children are it's inhabitants. The temple, to which they were directed by the &s;age, Wi&s;dom, is that of Virtue, tae only re&s;idence of Happine&s;s; and the Hovel, from whence there is a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age into the temple, the abode of Repentance. Happine&s;s is the univer&s;al hope of mankind; yet, like the little children who di&s;obeyed the command given them, they perver&s;ely &s;eek it in the rounds of folly, and the gratification of &s;en&s;e; thence the various cares and di&s;ea&s;es, repre&s;ented by the birds and bea&s;ts of prey; which $ender life a bur|den to &s;ome, de&s;troy it in others, and impel many to wan|der in the horrid woods of madne&s;s and de&s;pair. Such has been thy pur&s;uit after happine&s;s. Thine indu&s;try was prompted by the hope of gain, and the de&s;ire of riches, for the purpo&s;es of &s;en&s;uality; vanity has made thee pro|fu&s;e, and thou ha&s;t extended thy patronage to obtain the de&s;picable incen&s;e of &s;ervile adulation. The countenance of princes, and the homage of the herd, at fir&s;t inflated thy little mind; and novelty made thee experience a deceitful &s;atisfaction. But the charm is removed! thy &s;en&s;es are palled with exce&s;s; adulation is become familiar; and thou ha&s;t reaped nothing from the company of the great, but the envy of tho&s;e with whom it was thy intere&s;t to have pre&s;erved a con&s;idence. Thou ha&s;t &s;latterers without friends, and plenty without enjoyment; hence melan|choly lours on thy countenance, and di&s;content preys on thy heart. Know, then, whatever is undertaken, without a view of promoting the intere&s;ts of virtue, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily end in di&s;appointment and chagrin. Such is the mo|ral to be drawn from the &s;cene thou ha&s;t contemplated. Be wi&s;e, ob&s;erve it, and be happy."</P>
<P>Here the Genius withdrew, in a blaze of effulgence; and
<PB N="88" REF="88">
the &s;un-heams, at that moment playing on the eyes of Ha&s;|&s;an, awaked him from his profitable vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>He pro&s;trated hum&s;elf in grateful adoration before the in|dulgent Alla; conformed his life to the precepts of the Genius; and enjoyed, to a good age, the felicity which he had been told it would produce, and which will &s;eldom or never fail to re&s;ult from an uniform adherence to &s;imi|lar pur&s;uits.</P>

<P>Behold, my brother! all nature wears the &s;mile of glad|ne&s;s: the birds carele&s;sly chirp away the hours; they an|ticipate not the deva&s;tations of the murderous fowler. The herds and flocks contentedly graze on the hills, or frolick over the plains; all happy, though de&s;tined all to bleed. The flowery orders contribute their &s;hare towards the delightful pro&s;pect; vie with each other in di&s;playing the mo&s;t luxuriant beauties, and unite in delectably per|fuming the circumambient air. The meane&s;t herb, and mo&s;t minute blade of gra&s;s, glow with fre&s;hne&s;s and ani|mation. It is the &s;till voice of Gratitude, and the Al|mighty Creator regards them&mdash;will he not then regard thee? He &s;upports the &s;parrow, will he not then &s;upport thee? "Thou art of more worth than many &s;parrows." Yes, my friend, he has &s;pread this &s;cene for thy u&s;e: he is ever endeavouring to make thee happy; and is now at hand to rai&s;e thy de&s;ponding heart, if thou wilt but re|que&s;t it of him. Ah! thine eye brightens; that tear pleads for thee more than the mo&s;t itudied form of words: it has &s;oothed thy &s;oul; thy brow is placid. Re&s;ign thy melan|choly weeds, and put on the decent garment of chearful|ne&s;s. Courage! the ro&s;e blo&s;&s;oms among thorns, and the berry grow amid brambles. Sweet, without occa&s;ional bitter, would pall; trial enhances the value of ea&s;e, and affliction determines the exi&s;tence of bli&s;s.</P>
<P>The warme&s;t thanks of mankind are due to tho&s;e who, to divert us from chagrin, are always turning the bright &s;ide of every pro&s;pect towards us; and endeavouring to &s;ub&s;titute the dimple of Chearfulne&s;s for the wrinkle of Care.</P>
<P>If &s;uch have not the good wi&s;hes of tho&s;e they thus benefit, they have a better reward&mdash;that innate &s;un&s;hine which virtuous hope ever in&s;pires.</P>
<P>Chearfulne&s;s is the bal&s;am of life. Woe to the hypo|crite, and under&s;tanding to the enthu&s;ia&s;t, who would de|prive us of it's comforts!

<PB N="91" REF="91">
po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething like a re&s;emblance to the former, on an unprejudiced examination, we &s;hall find that they are both as oppo&s;ite in characteri&s;tick as in effect; for the one is as baneful as the other is &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Levity is the child of Indi&s;cretion, and the mother of Di&s;appointment: her eye &s;parkles with intoxication, and the glow of her countenance is the di&s;hone&s;t &s;lu&s;h of ex|ce&s;s; the &s;mile of Delight &s;oftens not her cheek, but the Ioud laugh of Inanity frequently di&s;torts her features. She dre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in the gari&s;h ornaments of Art; her temperature is unequal as the complexion of April; and, though &s;he is always foremo&s;t in the dance, her heart ge|nerally heaves with the &s;igh of regret. A &s;tranger to re|flection, &s;he &s;tudies not con&s;equences; &s;he &s;ub&s;titutes whim for ta&s;te, and profu&s;ion for liberality; her &s;ong has no moral, and her hope is unknown even to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>How delightfully contra&s;ted a &s;ubject is Chearfulne&s;s! the daughter of Rea&s;on, the companion of Virtue, and the parent of Hope. Her eyes are beautiful as the tints of the morning: the &s;oft Smiles are proud to &s;teal ki&s;&s;es from her downy check; and the Loves mi&s;take her lips for the ro&s;es of Hy$la. Her mien po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the graces of the &s;pring; and the theme of her &s;ong is the harve&s;t of Peace. Her cloathing is mode&s;t as the verdant mantle of Nature, woven by the dewy-fingered daughters of May: the Hours are ever gradually employed in weaving fre&s;h chaplets for her brow, and in &s;trewing her way with the mo&s;t delightful offerings of Flora. Health is at heir right-hand, Oeconomy on her left, and the Plea&s;ures &s;up|port her train.</P>
<P>Know, ye &s;eekers of Happine&s;s, that the ine&s;timable jewel is wholly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Chearfulne&s;s, who re|ceived it from Virtue. Know, al&s;o, that her counterfeit, Levity, is ever lying in wait to deceive you; but it re|quires not the acute eye of profound Sagacity to detect the impo&s;tor. The frippery of the children of Folly &s;hrinks from the inve&s;tigation of Rea&s;on; and the touch|&s;tone of Common Sen&s;e will quickly di&s;tingui&s;h between the varni&s;hed ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;pecious Deceit, and the &s;terling purity of una&s;&s;uming Integrity.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS, ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE majority of tho&s;e numerous literary trifles. aptly termed <HI>Fragments,</HI> are, like the generality of <HI>broken pieces,</HI> remarkable only for their disjointed ap|pearance, and jagged extremities. Fragments, in general&punc; give one room to &s;uppo&s;e that the writer could not pro|duce a whole. Fifty can make a graceful bow, to one who can walk a tolerable minuet. A good fragment leaves the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion on our minds as we &s;hould ex|perience on finding a portion of any limb modelled by the chizel of Piaxiteles&mdash;we long to &s;ee the whole figure.</P>
<P>It may be hence argued in favour of fragments, that as a &s;ingle limb, produced by &s;uch an arti&s;t, is infinitely more e&s;timable than a whole groupe of figures manu|factured by clumly, unnatural workman; &s;o an excel|lent fragment &s;urpa&s;&s;es in worth volumes of the in&s;ipid tra&s;h, which, to the dilgrace of the pre&s;ent age, over-runs the pre&s;s, and deba&s;es literature.</P>

<P>The ro&s;e is a pretty emblem of Virtue: it flouri&s;hes in every &s;oil, rich and poor; giving additional graces to the fertility of the one, and largely detracting from the &s;te|rility of the other. So Virtue not only increa&s;es the bril|liancy of the informed mind, but likewi&s;e gives a dignity to the mo&s;t uncultivated, that Learning, with all her boa&s;t, could never yet be&s;tow. The ro&s;e is &s;triking without gaudine&s;s, and delicate without tamene&s;s; as Virtue is humble without meanne&s;s, and noble without o&s;tentation. Though the &s;mell of this flower is not e&s;teemed &s;o exqui|&s;itely poignant as that of many others; yet, while they &s;oon pall, we return to the fragrance of the ro&s;e with in|crea&s;ing delight; and that fragrance charms us long after the frail tints of beauty are gone.

<HEAD>SOPHY LEFEVRE; OR, THE POOR BLIND GIRL.</HEAD>
<P>"PITY a poor blind girl!" expre&s;&s;ed in one of tho&s;e tones of pathetick appeal, to which the mi&s;er, muttering a grudge as he throws it, di&s;bur&s;es his boarded farthing, were the words which arre&s;ted the ha&s;ty cour&s;e of the young Harry Noble, towards the compting-hou&s;e of his father, a merchant of family, in whom the au|thority of the parent was blended with the confidence of a friend; for he had the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of his &s;on's merit; and that &s;on, his only child, amply ju&s;tified the opinion entertained of him.</P>
<P>The feelings of our youth, &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t re|fined impre&s;&s;ions of humanity, were &s;o poignantly af|fected by the abrupt addre&s;s, that he &s;tood for &s;ome minutes in mute contemplation of the object who uttered it. She was &s;itting on the &s;tep of a &s;hop door; and, though in rags and barefooted, pre&s;ented a figure un|commonly intere&s;ting. Her proportions &s;eemed perfectly delicate: her long auburn hair, &s;preading over her &s;houl|ders, helped in &s;ome mea&s;ure to veil that bo&s;om, which a &s;mall &s;lip of dirt$ cotton but ill concealed; her eyes were clo&s;ed, as if in gentle &s;leep; and, though her cheek was pall$d through want, her features were of that kind which immediately engage concern.</P>
<P>While he &s;urveyed her, &s;he was unfeelingly repre|hended for &s;itting on her hard &s;eat, by a coxcomb of a &s;hopman, in Morocco &s;lippers; who <HI>purte&s;ted nobody couldn't pa&s;s</HI> for her. "Empty fool! he could not have heard her appeal," cried Harry to him&s;elf; and, darting a look of warme&s;t indignation at the fop, followed the meek petitioner; who, having begged pardon in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner for her crime, went a few paces far|ther;
<PB N="98" REF="98">
and, leaning her back again&s;t a water-trunk, ex|claimed, with a deep &s;igh&mdash;"God help me!"</P>
<P>"God help thee, indeed!" cried Hury, putting a few &s;hillings into her hand: it was all he could find about him. Elevated at her good fortune&mdash;"Whoever you are," &s;he cried, "God in heaven"&mdash;her voice fal|tered a moment&mdash;"ble&s;s&mdash;" She bur&s;t into tears. It was too much for Harry: he caught her hand, in the impu$$e of &s;ublime benevolence&mdash;"Come with me, my poor, good girl!" And, in&s;en&s;ible to the ridicule of tho&s;e who ob&s;erved the &s;cene, led the unre&s;i&s;ting mourner into a court, in an adjoining &s;treet, where the family nur&s;e lived; and, entreating the good woman to provide her with &s;ome of her daughter's cloaths, &s;aid he would call again in two hours, and then proceeded on his bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>His wi&s;hes were commands with all who knew him; and, on his return, he beheld, with plea&s;ure, the object of his compa&s;&s;ion, the picture of a Sleeping Grace, at|$red by the hand of homely neatne&s;s. The manner and language in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude, evinced an education and capacity of the &s;uperior kind, and excited a curio&s;ity in Henry relative to the events of her life; which, being delicately imparted to her, &s;he chearfully con&s;ented to gratify.</P>
<P>"The circum&s;tances I am going to relate," &s;aid &s;he, "may appear a little &s;trange; they are neverthel&s;s true. I am but &s;eventeen: my fathe$, a We&s;t India planter, I baiely remember; he died rich, and left me 5000l. under the joint guardian&s;hip of my mother, and a gentleman named Gray, who had long been intimately connected with the family.</P>
<P>"I felt not the lo&s;s of a father: my mother doated on me, and &s;pared neither pains nor expence in my education; in&s;tructing me her&s;elf in all the &s;ublime duties of Chri&s;|tianity, and continually enforcing her precepts by prac|tice.</P>
<P>"Her exertions for my improvement were always warmly &s;econded by Mr. Gray; who, by his particular attention to us both, gained &s;o far on the affections of my mother, that, at the age of thirteen, I cea&s;ed to be father|le&s;s. My dear mother &s;urvived her marriage but three

months. You may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;uffered enough from &s;uch a misfortune; but time, youth, and the re|markable kindne&s;s of my father-in-law, reconciled me to my&s;elf; and, for nearly two years longer, I lived with|out a wi&s;h to form any other connections. Here my mi&s;eries began. My father, by his extravagant way of living, and an unfortunate attachment to gaming, had &s;o far involved his own fortune, that, to repair it, he em|barked mine in a &s;peculative adventure, with a &s;et of de|&s;igning men, who held out a pro&s;pect of advantage too a&s;&s;uring to with&s;tand. You may ea&s;ily imagine how it turned out: he was compleatly duped; and, in the frenzy of de&s;pair, &s;hot him&s;elf. I was on a vi&s;it at his cou&s;in's, when the information was brought me; and, after I had recovered the &s;hock &s;uch intelligence gave me, was in|formed that, in future, I was to look up to that cou&s;in for protection. This was readily promi&s;ed me; but I found the behaviour of the family $Word$ altered. I was poor, and no longer entitled to re&s;pect. I had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in every branch of learning I had entered on; &s;ufficient, indeed, to teach others tolerably well; and Mr. Iron&s;ide made me a companion to his three daughters, who were all nearly my own age, with &s;trict injunctions to give them all the information I could. But my pupils, thinking me no better than a &s;ervant, paid little attention to my in&s;tructions; and their parents con|tinually throwing out $i$ts about poverty, dependence, fine education without fortunes, and many others of the &s;ame kind, ea&s;ily conceived, the &s;ervants were encouraged to treat me with contempt; the lea&s;t familiarity in me was accounted in&s;olence; and the occa&s;ional fits of melancholy &s;uch treatment produced, drew upon me the imputations of being &s;ulky and ungrateful.</P>
<P>"In this &s;ituation, &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ing without new mortifications, I continued a year; when I received an in&s;ult from Mr. Iron&s;ide, which terminated my depen|dence. He had often taken liberties with me I could &s;carcely brook, but that my nece&s;&s;ity obliged me to &s;ub|mit with patience: and one night, when his wife and daughters were on a vi&s;it, be entered my chamber, where I was reading; and, without ceremony, told me he had long loved me: as a proof, he had kept me a year, when

but for him I mu&s;t have &s;tarved; told me, I &s;hould never want while I was a good girl; and concluded in terms I blu&s;h to think of! and added, he hoped I would not be ungrateful. Fortunately, he had not fa&s;tened the door; for he was proceeding to rudene&s;s. Breaking from him, I flew down &s;tairs; and, by running into the &s;treet, e&s;caped him. I &s;tood for a moment con&s;idering what to do; and, at la&s;t, determined to go to the family laundre&s;s that night, who had always profe&s;&s;ed great fondne&s;s for me. I told her my &s;ituation frankly, and a&s;ked her what I &s;hould do; for I was re&s;olved never to go back to that hated hou&s;e. The idea of want her friend&s;hip was not proof again&s;t: &s;he talked a great deal of imprudence in young women, to which I li&s;tened in tears; and, reflect|ing in the u&s;ual manner of ignorant people on <HI>poor gentry,</HI> &s;aid, &s;he did want a girl to look after her three children, and if I liked to &s;tay for my <HI>wittles,</HI> till I could better my&s;elf, <HI>I mout.</HI> What to do I knew not. I was too in|experienced, and too young, to go out into the world. I accepted her $$ffer; and for &s;ix months led a life to which the one I had left was plea&s;ure. My time&mdash;for I eat not the bread of idlene&s;s&mdash;was unremit$ingly divided between lugging about three heavy children; &s;tanding at the wa&s;h-tub; carrying large loads of linen to families who employed her; and running half a dozen times a day to the pawnbroker's.</P>
<P>"My con&s;titution now began to &s;ink under &s;uch fa|tigue, and I fell into a violent fever, out of which I reco|vered in about a month, b$t, on a renewal of my &s;lavery, &s;ymptoms of a relapie $ppearing, my mi&s;tre&s;s, declaring &s;he could not afford to keep &s;ick people, de&s;ired me to look out for a lodging for my&s;elf, till I got better. I had three guineas in my pocket when I left Mr. Iron&s;ide's; and bad &s;ecretly pre&s;erved them hither to again&s;t any emergency which might happen. Accordingly, I took a little room at a chandler's &s;hop, and in two months perfectly reco|vered my &s;trength; but my money and cloaths were en|tirely gone, and I had a &s;ettled weakne&s;s in my eyes, which remained from my fir&s;t fever. I now made &s;everal applications for places, but could get none: "I was too young"&mdash;"Looked too &s;ickly"&mdash;"Was too meanly dre&s;&s;ed;" and fifty exceptions of the &s;ame nature. I even
<PB N="101" REF="101">
applied again to my old mi&s;tre&s;s the laundre&s;s; but, re|peating her aver&s;ion to decayed gentry, &s;he refu&s;ed me as well as the re&s;t. My eyes, by continually walking about with bad &s;hoes, grew daily wor&s;e. I had lived five weeks upon credit with my landlady, and &s;he was continually dunning me for her money; and, at la&s;t, went &s;o far as to recommend me to pro&s;titution: which piece of in&s;o|lence occa&s;ioning me to an&s;wer her much more &s;harply than prudence would have dictated, in a rage, &s;he pu&s;hed me out into the &s;treet, at eleven o'clock at night, in a violent &s;hower of rain, and &s;wore I &s;hould never enter her doors again.</P>
<P>"I crawled up a court; but, being found by the watchman, was dragged to the watch-hou&s;e as a di&s;or|derly per&s;on; put in the black hole; and next morning, on being taken before the magi&s;trate, was &s;ent, becau&s;e I had no money, with half a dozen &s;treet-walkers, to Bridewell.</P>
<P>"In this wretched place I &s;taid but a week, my eyes now growing very dim; and, on being liberated, I ap|plied to the officers of &s;everal pari&s;hes for relief, but in vain. "I did not belong to them"&mdash;"Was an impo&s;tor,' or&mdash;"Young enough to work," were &s;till the replies; and, at la&s;t, I determined to apply even to Mr. Iron&s;ide. I knocked at the door, but was driven away; and, &s;trolling into an adjoining field, &s;at down in a damp hovel, and abandoned my&s;elf to all the agonies of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"I thought my &s;ufferings unju&s;t, and murmured again&s;t Providence; but I recollected not that, when in affluence, I had forgot my departed mother's favourite precept&mdash;"Let not pro&s;perity deceive you." For the whirl of di&s;|&s;ipation I had lived in, after her death, made me lo&s;e &s;ight of my&s;elf; and that, I now conceive, was the occa&s;ion of my puni&s;hment.</P>

I dreamed I was re&s;tored to all my former &s;plendour:&mdash;but, good Heaven! never &s;hall I forget the emotions I felt when I waked to utter darkne&s;s. I &s;creamed with hor|ror; fell on my knees; prayed for mercy; wi&s;hed for death; and, had not a violent &s;tood of tears relieved me,
<PB N="102" REF="102">
God only knows whether I could long have &s;upported the de&s;perate con&s;tict of my mind. I &s;at crying and &s;obbing for about three hours, in&s;en&s;ible of the craving of hun|ger, and parching of thir&s;t; when a female voice rouzed me to recollection, by enquiring what was the matter with me. I &s;aid I was blind, and had no home. "Come with me, child," &s;aid the enquiter; and, taking my hand, led me away.</P>
<P>"In about half an hour we entered a hou&s;e; and, go|ing up three pain of &s;tairs, I under&s;tood from my compa|nion, who was an old woman, that it was her lodging, and might be mine, if I would help to earn the rent. I promi&s;ed to do any work I was capable of: &s;he told me, I need not work; &s;he would put me in an ea&s;ier method, by which I might get a great deal of money, and make it comfortable for us both. This was, to a&s;k alms in the &s;treet every day; and, having no alternative, I con&s;ented.</P>
<P>"In the morning &s;he took me to &s;ome well-frequented &s;treet; and, putting me in &s;uch a &s;ituation as I could be left in with &s;afety&mdash;having generally bread enough with me for two &s;canty meals, and &s;ome &s;mall-beer in a tin bottle&mdash;did not return for me till du&s;k.</P>
<P>"In this manner I have pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t &s;ix weeks; mi|&s;erably enough, God knows! Sometimes I got three or four &s;hillings a day; at others, not above one &s;hilling; and, &s;ometimes, nothing at all. The old woman always u&s;ed to increa&s;e or le&s;&s;en my daily allowance in proportion to my gains; and, when I came home with little or no|thing, u&s;ed to abu&s;e me very much indeed.</P>
<P>"I had been particularly unfortunate this la&s;t week; and, having ye&s;terday lo&s;t the tin bottle, &s;he &s;wore this morning if I did not produce her &s;omething at night, &s;he would leave me to &s;hift again for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I was extremely terrified; for, bad as my &s;ituation was, it was heaven, to the idea of being turned again into the &s;treet, incapable of helping my&s;elf. And this occa|&s;ioned my great joy, Sir, at receiving your bounty, for I had not a farthing; neither have I eaten any thing till this generous woman gave it me."</P>
<P>Here &s;he concluded her &s;tory. Harry then told her he would procure &s;ome means of provi&s;ion for her; and, de|&s;iring the nur&s;e to let her have every thing nece&s;&s;ary at
<PB N="103" REF="103">
his charge, left the hou&s;e: and, it being near dark, re|turned to the &s;pot where he fir&s;t &s;aw her, and watched for the coming of the old woman.</P>
<P>He did not wait long; for, &s;eeing one walking about, who by her manners he concluded was the right, he taxed her with his &s;u&s;picions: her confu&s;ion betrayed her; and he threatened to charge a con&s;table with her, unle&s;s &s;he confe&s;&s;ed all &s;he knew concerning Sophy, prom$&s;ing a re|ward if &s;he told truth. She gave him a &s;imilar account of finding Mi&s;s L$&s;evre in the field to that he had previ|ou&s;ly heard; and mentioned many &s;ad circum&s;tances of her life, gathered from her own mouth, which perfectly agreed with the relation ju&s;t gone over. Harry, &s;atisfied of the girl's veracity, gave the old woman a crown; and, ha&s;tening home, imparted the whole to his worthy father: &s;oliciting, at the &s;ame time, his patronage for the &s;ubject of his &s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Noble heard him with great &s;atisfaction; and pro|mi&s;ed, if the report of Mrs. Jones, after a week or two of trial, &s;hould be favourable to the girl, he would take her into his own family. This eventually proved the ca&s;e; and an eminent occuli&s;t, being con&s;ulted about her eyes, gave it as his opinion, that a film only was grown over them, which might be removed by couching.</P>
<P>He &s;ucceeded in the trial, and the lovely girl once more beheld the light; but was ordered to wear a fillet over her eyes for a few days, and to be admitted to the full u&s;e of them only by degrees.</P>
<P>The day the &s;hade was entirely removed, Harry, who had left town previous to the operation, returned. When Sophy heard his voice in the hall, &s;he trembled. The idea of beholding a youth, in who&s;e prai&s;e every one was zealous; and who had tran&s;lated her from the mo&s;t abject penury to plenty, and been the means of her recovering &s;ight; rai&s;ed in her emotions which &s;he &s;$arcely knew how to conceal: but, when he opened the parlour-door, where, be&s;ides her&s;elf, were Mr. Noble, with two female rela|tions, and pre&s;ented a figure replete with every manly grace, &s;he &s;urveyed him with a degree of admiration too palpable not to be noticed. Having paid re&s;pects to his father and cou&s;ins, in a mo&s;t in&s;inuating manner, he con|gratulated her on the re&s;toration of &s;ight; paid a hand|&s;ome
<PB N="104" REF="104">
compliments to her figure, which a fa&s;hionable un|dre&s;s &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage; and, with a be|coming familiarity, begged the honour of a &s;alute.</P>
<P>The moment his lips touched her's, all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s for&s;ook her, and &s;he &s;unk in his arms. Harry was quite di&s;concerted, and his heart gave him an intimation to which he was before a &s;tranger. Mr. Noble looked &s;erious: Sophy recovered; and, apologizing in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able for being &s;o overcome, in the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion, begged permi&s;&s;ion to retue. From that moment Harry and Sophy grew unea&s;y when &s;eparated; but &s;tudied their utmo&s;t to hide it from every one el&s;e, and from each other; for neither dared examine their hearts on the nature of their &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>Every interview now improved the attachment on both &s;ides; and one afternoon, when they were alone, Harry reading &s;ome mi&s;cellaneous poems to her, on mentioning the title of C$bber's Blind Boy, from a &s;ympathizing re|collection their eyes met, both half &s;uffu&s;ed with tears. Sophy blu&s;hed, and hung down her head. Harry, in the moment of pa&s;&s;ion, threw the book on the floor, him&s;elf at her feet, and poured out his &s;oul in profe&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t ardent love. Sophy heard him with di&s;tre&s;s; for honour fordade her to encourage &s;entiments her heart could not but approve. In language, artle&s;s as affecting, &s;he entreated him to leave her, le&s;t ob&s;ervation &s;hould &s;ubject her to the anger of his father; repre&s;ented to him the difference of their &s;ituations; and remarked, that on cool recollection, he him&s;elf would have but a mean opi|nion of her, &s;hould &s;he, as a reward for his genero&s;ity, endeavour to &s;educe his affection. He per&s;i&s;ted, however, in his &s;olicitations: &s;he aro&s;e to retire; he held her forci|bly, &s;till kneeling, and begged her not to con&s;ign him to de&s;pair. She bur&s;t into tears, conjured him to &s;et her go; and, having relea&s;ed her hand from his, was retreating to the door, when that of an anti-chamber opened, and pre&s;ented Mr. Noble to their view. Sophy was almo&s;t petrified; but Hurry, &s;ummoning a manly confidence, addre&s;&s;ed his father nearly as follows&mdash;</P>
<P>"In what you have witne&s;&s;ed, blame not that generous girl, but me. If you think me criminal, tell me &s;o mildly; you know I cannot bear your frown. I love Sophy; &s;he

is de&s;erving, you are ju&s;t: I look up to you as a father anxious for my happine&s;s, and da$e a&s;k her at your hand." He &s;tood in an attitude of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;u&s;pence: his father looked gravely for a minute; his features then relaxing&mdash;" My dear Harry," &s;aid he, "I thank you for the confidence you put in me. I <HI>am</HI> anxious for your happine&s;s, and will convince you &s;o.&mdash;Sophy, my love, come here." Then, joining their hands&mdash;" Take her," continued he; "I have ob&s;erved your mutual attach|ment &s;ince it's commencement, and the violence you have done your&s;elves in endeavouring to conceal it, from mo|tives of duty; particularly you, Sophy. You certainly, Harry, are the only one to blame, in what I have by ac|cident overheard; but, in the choice you have made, you have given me too great a proof of your good-&s;en&s;e and integrity, for me to oppo&s;e it. Take my ble&s;&s;ing, children; and may you both live long, happy as you are virtuous!"</P>
<P>They expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude in &s;uch effu&s;ions, as carry with them more &s;incerity than words: in a few days they were united; and lived long, an exemplary pattern of con|jugal harmony: he, a con&s;picuous in&s;tance of benevolence rewarded; and &s;he, of the in&s;crutable nature of the ways of Heaven; who, to the edification of our patience, is frequently at hand for our deliverance from trouble, when we lea&s;t expect it; and often leads us through the valley of &s;orrow to the gardens of plea&s;ure, and temple of happine&s;s.</P>
