<HEAD>REASONS
AGAINST
FIGHTING:
OR,
Some Account why the Confederates
could not expect the Briti&s;h Army
&s;hould join with them whenever
they thought fit to attack the
French.</HEAD>
<P>THE Town having been mo&s;t ma|liciou&s;ly
amu&s;ed with an Account
in a Printed Po&s;t&s;cript, which, (as
it is there managed and related,) is calculated
to lay as much Reproach on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Na|tion,
and on Her Maje&s;ty, as is po&s;&s;ible; it
cannot but be an acceptable Work to all
that have any Regard to the Honour of their
Countrey, or their Queen, to examine into
an Affair of &s;uch a Nature, and &s;tate the
&s;ame to the People, that they may not be
<PB N="2" REF="3">
impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es, and malici|ous
Con&s;tructions. In our fir&s;t Entrance
into the Merits of this Cau&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ave
a great deal of Fending and Proving about
the Matter of Fact, and therefore without
enquiring into the Truth of the Relation,
which is believed to be a meer Forgery of
the <HI>Scotchman</HI> who writes that Paper,
who&s;e Talent of Lying is &s;o well known to
Mankind; yet to deal the better with him
and his Party, we will for once &s;uppo&s;e
here all his Relation to be right, and &s;hall
argue from it as if it were &s;o, (<HI>viz.) I am
no Braggadocio nor Ga&s;con, but do a&s;&s;ure you,
that I never promi&s;ed my&s;elf more from a Day
of Battle than I did from this; and I prepared
my&s;elf to fight, when&mdash;refus'd to Second
me. I ask'd him, what he did there then? He
told me, he came to fight, but that he had re|ceiv'd
Orders, which he &s;hew'd me, not to act
offen&s;ively again&s;t the Army of</HI> France.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing this then to be true, who are
they that make Complaint? This Author
&s;ays, <HI>many do;</HI> it is hoped it is not our good
Friends and Confederates the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Many
Rea&s;ons concur to move us to hope thus of
them: Principally that it was for &s;ome Ages
the Practice of that wi&s;e and wary People,
with us, and with all their Allies, it hath
been &s;o often, and &s;o loudly complained of
by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court in former Days, and
by their other Confederates that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
&s;ent their Deputies into the Army to con|troul
<PB N="3" REF="4">
their Generals; and &s;uch fatal Effects
have been found to be the Con&s;equence of
it, that &s;urely it can never be the <HI>Dutch</HI> that
&s;hould complain of being abandoned, but
they &s;hould look back to their former Con|duct
in the like Ca&s;es, of which the Hi&s;tory
of tho&s;e Days is full. If his Grace the Duke
of <HI>Marlborough</HI> plea&s;eth to give an Account
of the many Occa&s;ions in which this Con|duct
of the States-General hath been fatal to
King <HI>William,</HI> in his Wars in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
there will be but too many In&s;tances of the
like, more e&s;pecially beginning at the
Siege of <HI>Bonne</HI> in the Year 1674, or there|abouts.</P>
<P>If his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>
doth not think fit to give his Evidence in
this Ca&s;e, the Opponents being at this Time
&s;omething Allied to his Grace's Intere&s;t,
there are not wanting living Witne&s;&s;es to
prove it, when the States Field-Deputies
refu&s;ed to let the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces fight, as
e&s;pecially during the fir&s;t Part of the late
War, at the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Steenkirk,</HI> at <HI>Beau|mont,</HI>
before that at the long March to gain
the <HI>French</HI> Lines, when the late <HI>Dauphin</HI>
commanded the <HI>French</HI> Army; al&s;o at the
fir&s;t Siege of <HI>Mons</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> at the
fir&s;t Siege of <HI>Namure,</HI> and many more In|&s;tances
of like Nature: It was not without
very great Difficulty that the late King
<HI>William</HI> obtain'd &s;o entire a Confidence to
be placed in him by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as to have
<PB N="4" REF="5">
the Command of the Army compleatly in
him&s;elf. Soon as the King was dead, al|though
they have committed the Command
of their Troops to the Duke of <HI>MarlBorough,</HI>
to Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and the like Great Gene|rals,
yet is it plain it is all Subject, and un|der
Orders, to the Five <HI>Dutch</HI> Field-Dep$|ties,
who have their Voices in every Coun|cil
of War; and who, though they have
no Command in the Army, yet have a
Univer&s;al Command over the whole Army.
Nor can the General Act, or March, much
le&s;s Fight, if they plea&s;e to put in their Ne|gative
at a Council of War. If it is al|ledged
that they never gave their Negative
upon any probable Action, it &s;hall be an|&s;wered
in many Particulars, but not to di&s;|pute
that; it is certain they are empowered to
give a Negative mo&s;t effectually, in Ca&s;e
of which Negative the Troops would not
act, no although their General &s;hould
command them. And what &s;hall we &s;ay,
that after and notwith&s;tanding this, the
Queen &s;hould have le&s;s Authority to act than
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> that Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould not
have Power to prevent the Effu&s;ion of
Blood, when &s;he may &s;ee the Conclu&s;ion of
a Peace &s;o ea&s;ie, if the Confederates would
hear Rea&s;on; that there &s;hould be no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of &s;uch a Butchery, as that of <HI>Blareg|nies,</HI>
to gain perhaps the bare Retreat of the
<HI>French,</HI> and perhaps not that.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
But to wave that Part till afterward, and
return to what was mentioned before, after
the P&mdash;of <HI>O</HI>&mdash;was come to be ad|vanced
to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> $hrones, and by his
Succe&s;&s;es in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>$$eland</HI> had made
him&s;elf more popular in <HI>Holland</HI> than before,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> finding al&s;o that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were
ill &s;atisfied with the Diffidence the States
had always &s;hewn in the Tru&s;ts of their
Army, came at la&s;t into the Mea&s;ures the
King had laid before them, and committed
their Forces to the King, with a Di&s;cretio|nary
Power to Fight, or not to Fight, when
he thought fit. It &s;hould not be forgotten
that the States were moved to this, by &s;ee|ing
the King at the Head of a Powerful
Army of his own Troops, entirely com|manding
the <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Armies;
and that if they &s;hould refu&s;e to give up
their Troops to him, he would be in a Con|dition
to &s;ight the <HI>French,</HI> or undertake &s;ome
Siege without their Help that their Troops
would not only lo&s;e the Honour, but the
States them&s;elves &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened in the
Figure they made in the Confederacy; that
as their Troops &s;hould perhaps be &s;carcely
in the Action, &s;o neither would their Inte|re&s;ts
be equally taken Care of in ca&s;e of any
Advantages obtained. The&s;e, and many
more, were the Arguments which really
brought in the States-General to con&s;ent to
take off their Field-Deyuties from the Ar|my,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and leave the King entirely to act as he
&s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People who remember any Thing
of what is behind them cannot forget how
great a Point it was thought gained when
the <HI>Dutch</HI> were brought to do thus; how
the Succe&s;s, which was promi&s;ed to Affairs,
encouraged the Parliament and People to go
on more warmly in the Pro&s;ecution of the
War, becau&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> had now con&s;ent|ed
to take away their Re&s;traints: After the
Death of the King, as well when the Ar|mies
were commanded by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Over|kirk</HI>
as by the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> him&s;elf,
the &s;aid <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies were replaced in
their Army; on all Occa&s;ions they were ad|mitted
to &s;it in the Councils of War, and
if they did not give their A&s;&s;ent no Action
of Moment could be undertaken; farther,
the States have kept &s;uch a Negative upon
the Actions in the Field, as that even when
the Council of War have often re&s;olved on
this or that, tho&s;e Re&s;olutions have been
fir&s;t &s;ent to the <HI>Hague</HI> for the Approbation
of the States them&s;elves before they could be
put in Practice, though the Field-Deputies
have been con&s;enting to it before in the
Army. Such hath been the Power the
States-General have always re&s;erved in
their Hands to govern and re&s;train the Af|fairs
of the Army and the War, by which,
in Effect, they had the Command of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Armies and Generals; the Queen
<PB N="7" REF="8">
had the Name indeed of being at the Head
of the Confederacy, and had the Power to
put a General of Her own in the Command
over Her own Troops; but even Her Ma|je&s;ty,
and all Her Generals and Forces,
were &s;o far under the Command of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and &s;o far to be governed by the
Councils at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that nothing could
be done without fir&s;t applying to the &s;aid
States, or their Deputies, for their Con&s;ent:
Thus we willingly &s;ubmitted to having gi|ven
our&s;elves up to <HI>Dutch</HI> Councils, it is
not to be wonder'd that this, and more,
was &s;tooped to by &s;uch People as were come
into a State of Pupilage to the States; and
who left both the Direction of the War,
and the Management of the Peace, to them,
as if their own Nation had no Intere&s;t or
Concern in it, other than to receive their
Orders from their High Mightine&s;&s;es:
Whether it is more wonderful that any Peo|ple
&s;hould thus Sacrifice their Countries In|tere&s;t
to a Selfi&s;h Neighbour, and with a
profound and implicit Submi&s;&s;ion &s;hould
give them&s;elves over to the Management
of a Foreign Nation? Or that the &s;ame
People &s;hould now complain that Her Ma|je&s;ty
a&s;&s;umes a little Her Right of judging
when it is Right or Safe to hazard Battle,
or not, as well as the <HI>Dutch.</HI> It &s;eems to &s;ome
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have taken this Part upon
them &s;o long, that it &s;hould now be challeng|ed
as their due; and that the Exclu&s;ion of the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is mo&s;t Righteous, that
the States alone &s;hould have a Negative Voice
in the Field&punc; that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Generals were
never to Fight but when the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave them
Leave, and were always to fight when they,
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> propo&s;ed it: It is counted as an
Aggravation in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, that Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> was for Fighting the <HI>French,</HI> and to
Crown all, <HI>the</HI> Dutch <HI>Deputies had con&s;ented;</HI>
a Mighty Argument! What is the Infe|rence?
Then it was a mo&s;t Heinous Offence
that our General had not Orders to comply;
&s;o that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces mu&s;t Bleed, and
Die, and March, and Fight, or lye Still,
ju&s;t as Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Depu|ties
think fit that whenever the&s;e, for the
carrying on their Separate Views, think fit
to attack the <HI>French</HI> Army, tho' entrench'd
up to the Teeth, fortified and po&s;ted to Ad|vantage,
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops, like Obedient
Slaves, mu&s;t fall on with the greate&s;t Ha|zard;
for it is well known that Her Ma|je&s;ties
Troops are never failed of the Po&s;ts
of Danger, and the Hote&s;t and mo&s;t De&s;pe|rate
of the Service. On the other Hand,
if the Advantages which offer, however
great, are accepted by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Generals,
unle&s;s the <HI>Dutch</HI> plea&s;e to join their A&s;&s;ent:
Our Men can on no Account embrace the
Opportunity; there are Numberle&s;s Exam|ples
of this Kind to be given but we e&s;teem
it &s;o known a Truth in the Army, and eve|rywhere
el&s;e, that it is needle&s;s to mention
<PB N="9" REF="10">
any more what is &s;o Univer&s;ally known: How
then comes it to be &s;urprizing to the People
here that Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould, when &s;he &s;ees
Cau&s;e, a&s;&s;ume that Authority in the Army
which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have &s;o avowedly practi&s;ed?
And why is not Her Maje&s;ty as much of
Right empowered to do this when her own
Affairs require it, as the States-General have
been when their Affairs have likewi&s;e re|quired
it? Ob&s;erve here, the Di&s;pute in
this Part has no Relation to the Rea&s;ons
why Her Maje&s;ty declines hazarding a Bat|tle
with the <HI>French;</HI> but to the Right Her
Maje&s;ty has when Her own Affairs make it
rea&s;onable upon any Score to Fight, or not
to Fight, as She thinks fit.</P>
<P>Having thus made a Prote&s;t in Her
Maje&s;ty's Name for the Re&s;ervation to Her|&s;elf,
the guiding of Her own Affairs, it
comes in order to examine the Ca&s;e before
us, which has given &s;o great an Occa&s;ion
of Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Queen has
given Orders to Her Generals not to Fight
with the <HI>French,</HI> or to undertake any Siege;
we &s;hall be wary in &s;aying that there might
be, or that there are, Rea&s;ons why it might
not be Safe for Her Maje&s;ty to hazard Her
Troops, and that there may be good
Rea&s;ons why, as Ca&s;es &s;tand, the Queen
&s;hould not venture a Battle in Conjun|ction
with the Allies, who are now in the
Field with Her: But this may be &s;aid Safely,
that whereas the Endeavours of a Party
<PB N="10" REF="11">
among us to render the Mini&s;try here, and
the Management of Affairs in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Court, &s;u&s;pected to the Allies, and that tho&s;e
wicked De&s;igns have had but too much
Succe&s;s; &s;o that great Mi&s;under&s;tandings,
&s;candalous Mi&s;repre&s;entations, and Inve|ctives,
have too much &s;upplied the Place
of the u&s;ual mutual Confidence and Affecti|on
which was formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
ought now to have been cultivated between
Her <HI>Britannic</HI> Maje&s;ty and Her Allies; it
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that in this Ca&s;e the &s;ame
Harmony, the &s;ame Unity, the &s;ame Con|fidence,
could be between them as it were
to be wi&s;hed; and therefore while that
Confidence on both Sides hath been &s;o Art|fully
le&s;&s;ened it cannot be expected, e&s;pe|cially
by that Side, who have &s;o openly
profe&s;t their Jealou&s;ie and Di&s;&s;atisfaction,
that the other &s;hould with the like Freedom,
as on former Occa&s;ions, hazard with them
in &s;o Nice and &s;o Critical an Affair as that
of a General Battle.</P>
<P>This is not all, but it is not unknown of
what Con&s;equence the lea&s;t Blow or Di&s;ap|pointment
in Ca&s;e of Action might be to
Her Maje&s;ty's Affairs; the Party here have
not been &s;ilent in their Malicious Expecta|tions,
and have not &s;crupled to let us know
that they had &s;ome Hopes in a Di&s;appoint|ment;
they have been heard to &s;ay that
One Defeat of the Army, One Battle in the
Field, would ruin the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, and
<PB N="11" REF="12">
fright the Queen into other Mea&s;ures: As the&s;e
are the known Hopes of this Party, and that
the Secret Corre&s;pondence between them,
and &s;ome Leading Men Abroad, who have
it much in their Power to do either Good
or Hurt in a Day of Battle, is al&s;o known,
it may not be an ill-grounded Caution, that
we &s;hould be backward to hazard a Battle
with the Enemy, while in Conjunction with
&s;ome who entertain a &s;trict Confederacy with
that Party here, who own, as above, that
their Hopes are founded upon a Suppo&s;ition
of the Army receiving a Defeat Abroad: It
is &s;ugge&s;ted that this is Suppo&s;ititious, that
no &s;uch Thoughts have been entertain'd
here, and that our Confederates are not
capable of entertaining any Thing &s;o Di&s;ho|nourable,
nor could practi&s;e the Thing
without Ruin and De&s;truction to them|&s;elves:
This may have many An&s;wers to it,
all of them &s;ignificant of the Thing, and
ju&s;tifying the Conduct of a Nation in &s;uch
a Ca&s;e. 1. That if the&s;e People here have
no &s;uch Thoughts, as perhaps &s;ome among
them may abhor &s;o wicked a Practice;
but why do they &s;peak it in their own Di&s;|cour&s;e?
Why do they plea&s;e them&s;elves
with the talking of it? Do their Tongues
&s;peak what their Hearts never thought?
It may be too true of them, that they think
little, and might talk of &s;mall matters with|out
Meaning, but Capital Mi&s;chiefs never
hang on the Tongue but when they are
<PB N="12" REF="13">
dictated from the Heart; why &s;hould they
talk thus? Would they be thought more
Wicked than they are? Or would they talk
what they did not intend, on Purpo&s;e, and
with De&s;ign, to make them&s;elves be &s;u&s;pect|ed?
Have we not heard them in the Public
Coffee-hou&s;es &s;ay on the la&s;t Proclaimed Fa&s;t
that they did not know how to keep it,
that they did not know whether they &s;hould
pray for Succe&s;s upon our Armies, yea,
or no? Or whether it were not as good that
we &s;hould be beaten Abroad, that it might
bring us to our Sen&s;es at Home; that One
Battle lo&s;t would ruin the Mini&s;try, and
blow them all up, and &s;uch Talk as this; nay,
have we not many &s;o far exa&s;perated, that
will &s;top their Ears, or &s;it down in the mid&s;t
of the Public Prayers, when the Mini&s;ter
is praying for the be&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings upon the
Queen, and for Succe&s;s to Her Maje&s;ty's
Forces both at Sea and Land? They treat
Her Maje&s;ty with more Freedom in their
Cups, and long ago have they left off To&s;t|ing
a Health to the Generals, or Succe&s;s to
our Arms; while this Principle prevails, let
any one judge whether it is Safe for us to
venture an Engagement, tho' with an Ene|my
le&s;s Con&s;iderable, and le&s;s Dangerous,
than the <HI>French,</HI> while thus Circum|&s;tanc'd
at Home, and while the&s;e People
boa&s;t of their &s;trict Alliance, and clo&s;e
Friend&s;hip Abroad, with &s;uch People, up|on
who&s;e Conduct the Sum of Affairs very
much depends.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
This is not to be con&s;trued as a Reflecti|on
on the Fidelity of the Allies, or a De|claration
that there is any &s;uch Thing as a
Di&s;tru&s;t on the Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court of
the Ju&s;tice or Faithfulne&s;s of the Confede|rates&punc;
but it mu&s;t be acknowledged by any
unbya$ed Judgment that the&s;e People have
done what is <HI>their po&s;&s;ible</HI> to create &s;uch a
Jealou&s;ie: After &s;uch Notices of their
Minds at Home, and Boa&s;ts of their In|fluence
Abroad, a Mini&s;try, le&s;s wary,
and le&s;s penetrating, than ours, might be well
ju&s;tified in re&s;olving to Ri&s;que nothing with
them: This is mo&s;t &s;ure, that they would
be mo&s;t inexcu&s;able, who after &s;uch Warn|ings
&s;hould venture a Thing of &s;o great a
Con&s;equence as a Battle, on a Di&s;appoint|ment
wherein they had an A&s;&s;urance that
&s;o much of the Hopes of their Enemies
did depend. Hi&s;tory might be brought to
give Evidence in this Ca&s;e, where in Affairs
le&s;s Critical than the&s;e Cautions have been
taken, and Mea&s;ures of Safety pur&s;ued, on
the lea&s;t Di&s;covery of the Secret De&s;igns of
Parties among the Confederate Troops.</P>
<P>It may be needful to &s;ay &s;omething here
to the Objection following, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
this cannot be Rational to &s;u&s;pect, becau&s;e
it cannot be practi&s;ed but at the Ruin of
the Confederates: But many In&s;tances
have been given in the World of Armies
driven to Exigences, by being de&s;erted or
for&s;aken in the Time of Action by their
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Friends, without giving the Enemy Oppor|tunity
to break in upon the Parties who have
&s;o for &s;aken them, of any where to hurt them:
There have not wanted In&s;tances of this,
even between the &s;ame Parties we are &s;peak|ing
of, when in the Sea-fight between the
Confederate Fleet and the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, off
of <HI>Beachy-Head,</HI> in the Year 1690, when the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Admirals complained of their being
for&s;aken and betrayed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ad|mirals,
and left to the Mercy of the <HI>French</HI>
Fleet, while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made their Retreat
in the be&s;t Manner they could, that by this
Means the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy were pre&s;erved,

their Squadron burnt and de&s;troyed, or
taken by the <HI>French,</HI> and the re&s;t of the
Fleet, being <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> made off: This
was afterwards brought before the King,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirals complaining,
threatned, that unle&s;s they had Satisfaction
they would never hazard a Fight in Con|ju$ction
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> any more.</P>
<P>This is brought but as a parallel Ca&s;e,
for upon Examination no Treachery was
found in the $a&s;e at all, but the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Admiral thought the Inequality too
great to venture a general Engagement;
likewife in this Ca&s;e we may be ju&s;tly &s;aid
to be Unea&s;ie, and not think our&s;elves Safe,
while $i&s;under&s;tandings and Jealou&s;ies are
fomented between us and our Allies: Whe|ther

of the Parties, or no; but be tho&s;e Di&s;|&s;atisfactions
of what Kind &s;oever, it cannot
be Prudence for us to run the Hazards that
in other Ca&s;es might be done.</P>
<P>But to leave this ungrateful Part of the
Subject, it is not &s;aid, or &s;ugge&s;ted
here, that any Design was formed that
might look like abandoning, or betraying,
yet do many other Circum&s;tances concur to
make it rea&s;onable that they &s;hould not
Fight; that it is Her Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire, and
al&s;o the De&s;ire of all Her Faithful Subjects,
that a Good and La&s;ting Peace &s;hould be
made, has been openly declared; what el&s;e
has a Negotiation been &s;et on Foot for?
Her Maje&s;ty has other Work to do in the
World than to amu&s;e the Nations Abroad,
or Her Subjects at Home, with a Treaty,
if a Peace had not been Her De&s;ign: This is
not a Thing to be dallied with, if the Pious
and Chri&s;tian De&s;ign of the Queen meets
with Oppo&s;ition from Parties, who&s;e Views
are known to be the Confu&s;ion of their

<P>Her Maje&s;ty having, with mighty

New Intrigues were immediately &s;et or

would never &s;end any Mini&s;ters to the
Meeting, or take any Notice of it, all on a$
&s;udden they were not only come to the
Congre&s;s, but New Conferences, and New
Mea&s;ures, appear'd; the Imperial Mini|&s;ters
were every Day at the <HI>Hague,</HI> there
they conferr'd &s;ingly with other People&punc;
immediately the Subject of the Peace be|came
the Je&s;t of the Place: The Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Envoy and Plenipo|tentiary,
was Treated after a different and
uncommon Manner, and all the Councils
the Gentlemen had on that Affair di&s;cover|ed
an Inclination rather to prevent than
promote a Peace, as the propere&s;t Scheme to
carry on the De&s;igns of their Party, which
could not &s;tand, or hope for it, but by
carrying on the War.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
Thus they put off the Time, and &s;u&s;|pended
the Pro&s;ecution of the Peace, as
if they had a Certainty that the Armies
would join, that the Campaign would
begin, and &s;o the Treaty would be cut
in Two by the Sword; believing that if
they could get the Two Armies into
Action the Treaty would of Cour&s;e be
broken off.</P>
<P>Now Her Maje&s;ty di&s;appointed them
All by coming to this Happy Re&s;olu|tion,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) &startq;If ye will not treat of Peace,
neither will I carry on the War; if all
that can be expected by the War may
be obtained by a Treaty of Peace, I
cannot &s;atisfie my&s;elf to let any more
Blood be &s;hed when it may upon &s;o good
Grounds be prevented; therefore I &s;hall

<P>All this is &s;aid upon a Suppo&s;ition that

<PB N="18" REF="19">
have asked the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;o
In&s;olent a Que&s;tion on his giving his

Liberty in the Council of War to give
his Opinion to what &s;hall be there pro|pos'd

<HI>Eugene</HI> would not have made that Re|ply
to any Private Colonel, as to &s;ay,
<HI>What do you do here then?</HI> But had not his

to &s;uch an In&s;ult as that? Might
he not have &s;aid, &startq;That the Troops of his
Mi&s;tre&s;s were there, and had been there
Nine Year, to give his Ma&s;ter a Crown,
which he had neither Ability to gain
without them, nor Gra$$ude to acknow|ledge

it?&endq; Might he not have replied, They were

that; but our General contented him|&s;elf
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to give no other Reply than to &s;hew
his Orders; and this may be a very
good Rea&s;on for any Wi&s;e Men to be|lieve
no &s;uch Affront was offered to him;
for all that know the Duke know this

<P>But here it is fit that we ob&s;erve how

who rather than not form &s;omething

gro&s;s Forgeries, and put Affronts of the

Con&s;truction that can be put upon this

Intere&s;t, and that of her Allies al&s;o; for
if it were true in Fact, if Prince <HI>Eugene</HI>
did actually Send &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age to the
Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> or ask him &s;uch a
Que&s;tion upon his giving his Opinion a|gain&s;t

give &s;uch Orders? Is it not high Time
the Queen &s;hould be Mi&s;tre&s;s of Her own
Troops, and of Her own Part in the
War al&s;o? Indeed had there been no o|ther
Di&s;pute or Di&s;&s;atisfaction between them
before, yet &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age happening, the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> ought never to have
encamped in one Line with them after
it. This proves to any Con&s;idering Per|&s;on
to what a Degree of Subjection to our
Haughty Allies the Mini&s;try of late
Years had brought our Affairs, and how
till now we were to be called out when|ever
the Hirelings of the Foreign Prin|ces
pleas'd to demand it, and to attack
at whatever Expence of Blood, and with
whatever Di&s;advantage. Nothing can be
a greater Ju&s;tification to the Mea&s;ures now
taking than the In&s;olence of the Allies to
us, not on this Occa&s;ion only, but on
many other Occa&s;ions, and al&s;o of the
dangerous Corre&s;pondence carry'd on be|tween
&s;ome People Abroad, who&s;e Obli|gations
to Her Maje&s;ty call for other Things
from them; and a Party at Home, who

that we are not to be tru&s;ted with our

Hand, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> plea&s;e to make
it for us. Will any contend that we
&s;hould not now open our Eyes, and that
we &s;hould not now act by our own Coun|cils?
Will they &s;till &s;uppo&s;e us in our
Non-age and Pupil-age, that we mu&s;t be
led about Blindfold, and be made Tools

<HI>Imperial</HI> Ambition? The Party here, to
cover the Eyes of their Followers, have

now taken a New Cour&s;e in this Matter,

Her Maje&s;ty &s;eeks Occa&s;ions again&s;t the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and that we are all driving into
a War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as if we could be
in no Alliance with them, but &s;uch
a one in which they mu&s;t be allowed to
give the Law to our Conduct, and make
their Markets of us, by putting the mo&s;t
Shameful Tricks upon us, and managing
us to gain on their Crutches, or rather
carry them on our Shoulders; this has
been no New Practice; &s;ome Men had
Eyes to &s;ee it before, tho' now 'tis con|fe&s;t
it becomes more undeniably Public
by their own U&s;age of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation,
according to the following Lines out of
a Ballad of their own making, at the
Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI>
played as many fal&s;e Cards as they have
done now.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Whigs lately put out the Nation to Nur&s;e,</L>
<L>With an Old Wooden Leg and a Crutch,</L>
<L>And to teach us to Go, ty'd our <HI>Leading-&s;trings</HI> too,</L>
<L>And gave them to hold to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="23">
<L>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> as who would not, that under&s;tood
Trade,</L>
<L>Brought us up heavy Burthens to $word$;</L>
<L>And as we grew weak, they doubled our Pack,</L>
<L>And laid on the Weight of the War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like <HI>I&s;achar</HI>'s A&s;s, we couch'd to the Load,</L>

<L>The <HI>Dutch</HI> tho't we had been &s;o beat to the <HI>Road,</HI></L>
<L>We &s;hould be their <HI>Pack-Hor&s;e</HI> quite thro',</L>

<LG>
<L>But &s;ome Ages of Light have clear'd up our Sight,</L>
<L>And now from our Tutelage breaking,</L>
<L>We think we're at Age for our&s;elves to engage,</L>
<L>And the <HI>Peace</HI> may be of our own making.</L>
</LG>
<P>This is the true State of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ma$nagement,
which many People, who for$merly

Source of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e laid open, an$
when the Plot is more fully di&s;covered, $word$
Knavery of the Parties will be more eviden$
for it is not hard to per&s;wade any one$
believe that all this S$r is not made witho$$
&s;ome beginning, and without many pre$ous
Intrigues and $aballings of the Pa$
here with their Friends at the <HI>Hague&punc;</HI> a$
this brings us back to the Treaty of Pea$
and the Conduct of the Party in <HI>Engla$$</HI>
It is mentioned above how when the Im$riali&s;ts
<PB N="23" REF="24">
found a Treaty of Peace unavoida|ble,
and that Her <HI>Britannic</HI> Maje&s;ty pre&s;t
it &s;o earne&s;tly, that it would go on without
them, if they did not think fit to come in;
they at la&s;t complied, and how, after their
having &s;o complied their Application,
turn'd immediately to counter-act the Pro|gre&s;s
of the Treaty, that &s;o, tho' they could
not interrupt the beginning, they might
di&s;appoint the end of a Treaty, and bring
on the War by the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence;
what were the Mea&s;ures they took to bring
this to pa&s;s is obvious to every ordinary
View; and how far they obtain'd their
End, as they thought, is evident al&s;o; the
Armies being already in the Field, while
the Negotiations at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> were at a full
&s;tand, by the in&s;i&s;ting upon An&s;wers in
writing from the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries,
in&s;tead of entring into a Treaty by Confe|rence,
as was fir&s;t intended; during the
whole Negotiation at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> the Parties
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Holland</HI> &s;pread about Re|ports,
and po&s;itively affirmed, that the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Court had made a Separate Peace with
<HI>France;</HI> and even the <HI>Memorials</HI> from &s;ome
of the Foreign Mini&s;ters &s;ignified as much;
the Party from hence a&s;&s;ur'd them Abroad
&s;o con&s;tantly of it, that all Means po&s;&s;ible
were made u&s;e of to put a Stop to the Ne|gotiations,
that they might bring the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Mini&s;ters Abroad to declare them&s;elves;
but they were too penetrating for the other
<PB N="24" REF="25">
to break into their Councils, till the other
thought of this Experiment, which, as a
Great Man among the Party here &s;aid,
could not fail, and this was their la&s;t Re&s;ort,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the Armies &s;hould join, and that
a Motion &s;hould be made, whatever the Po|&s;ture
of Affairs might be, to attack the
<HI>French</HI> Army in their Camp, and force them
to a Battle; then, &s;aid they, you produce
the de&s;ired Effect, let it fail either Way;
for if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General Fights, we &s;hall
either Conquer or be Defeated, if we Con|quer
the Treaty of Peace is at End, if we
are Defeated the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> are
Ruined, and &s;o we &s;hall Conquer that
Way. On the other Hand, if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
General will not Fight then they di&s;cover
them&s;elves that they have made a Se|parate
Peace; that the&s;e have been the
Methods of the Party, and the Steps they
have taken, they may deny if they think
fit; but the publi&s;hing them here will &s;erve
to convince them that their Mea&s;ures are
not quite &s;o Impenetrable, or their private
Re&s;olves &s;o well Concerted and Concealed,
as they &s;latter them&s;elves to believe.</P>
<P>Now it may appear al&s;o, that altho' the&s;e
Things promi&s;ed a &s;ure Event equal to the
Expectation of the Contrivers, yet their Po|liticks
have failed at this Time, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Councils have thought fit to countermine all
this Plot; Fir&s;t, they have not been &s;o
<HI>Dupe</HI> as to be drawn into the Snare of Fight|ing,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
and engage the Enemy with a Confe|deracy,
who had &s;ome Views which made
it le&s;s E&s;&s;entaial than at another Time,
whether they were Victors, or not: Here
the Match was not equal; for the Victory
only was the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> General's Safety, the
only Security of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Queen,
and of the whole Nation&punc; whereas a Defeat,
however fatal to us, was not entirely with|out
&s;ome Pro&s;pects that render'd it le&s;s

at other Times; for, fay the&s;e Men, one
Blow would Ruin all the New Scheme, and
Re&s;tore Affairs, &s;et up the Old Mini&s;try
again, and break all the Mea&s;ures of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court. This is the Foundation up|on
which, as is &s;aid, &s;ome were &s;o open to
&s;ay, &startq;They knew not how to keep the Fa&s;t
that was appointed by Her Maje&s;ty for the

&s;ees the&s;e Things, judge Impartially, whe|ther,
while &s;uch a Temper is reigning a|mong
us, it would con&s;i&s;t with the Wi&s;dom
and Penetration of Her Maje&s;ty and Her
Council to venture a Battle, either as joined
with &s;uch Allies Abroad, or &s;urrounded
with &s;uch Private Enemies at Home, but by
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Councils we have
countermined this Plot; and now they find
them&s;elves all di&s;appointed, for they can
neither bring the Army to run Headlong
into an Engagement, nor have they yet
made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of our Mea&s;ures;
this Wi&s;dom however they have learn$d by
it, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Affairs are no
more in Foreign Management; that if
they will end the War Honourably, and
make a Firm, La&s;ting, Peace, they may
have the Concurrence of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court
for the Advantage of all their Intere&s;ts,
and for the procuring to them a Ju&s;t and
Rea&s;onable Satisfaction; but that the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Nation are not to be Bullied into the
War, as another &s;aid the Emperor would
not be Bullied into the Peace.</P>
<P>There are the true Plans of this Affair,
and now it &s;eems as if they are come to
&s;uch a Head, that they mu&s;t be brought
to an I&s;&s;ue one Way or other; the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Court have de&s;ired a Fair Treaty, that an
Honourable Peace might be obtained for
all Parties&punc; the Ob&s;tinacy of a few encou|couraged
from hence, and prompted at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> have done their utmo&s;t to prevent
that Peace being General; and as if they had
in&s;ulted our Court upon it, they had brought
it to this Point, which was &s;poken openly at
the <HI>Hague;</HI> &startq;We will take Care they &s;hall
not make a General Peace, and let them
make a Separate Peace if they dare: If they

they can, &s;hould <HI>Great-Britain</HI> make &s;uch a

may &s;ee Cau&s;e to blame them&s;elves; for
tho' the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> has been
very far from de&s;iring to make Her own
Peace exclu&s;ive from Her Allies, yet no
good Subject of Her Maje&s;ty can patiently
hear the Tools of the pre&s;ent Parties, or
the Emi&s;&s;aries of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e this
Peace, in&s;ult Her as being afraid to &s;e|cure
Her&s;elf and Her own People: If a Sepa|rate
Peace &s;hall be the Re&s;ult of the Ob&s;ti|nacy
of tho&s;e who&s;e Intere&s;ts are made
wilfully to oppo&s;e Her Maje&s;ty, the Con&s;e|quences
lye at their Door; Her Maje&s;ty is
not to be in&s;ulted by Prince <HI>Eugen$,</HI> or any
one el&s;e, as if She was afraid to pur&s;ue Her
own Mea&s;ures, or afraid to own what She
has propo&s;ed: The Intrigue is of Nece&s;&s;ity
to be now made Publick, the Mea&s;ures
taken on both Sides will now appear, yea,
they do appear: The Plot is again&s;t a Peace;
not again&s;t this or that Condition of
Peace, but again&s;t Peace in General; the
Tran&s;action is double, let us &s;ee the dark
Sides of both.</P>
<P>The Emperor is po&s;itive again&s;t a Peace,
his Rea&s;on is plain and undeniable; his is
the Gain of the War; all that hath been
fought for, or all that is contended for in
the War, or in the Peace, is for him: While
the Contention is carrying on, what is it he
<PB N="28" REF="29">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es? He receives the whole Revenues of
the Electorate of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and of the Dutchy
of <HI>Mantua,</HI> the large Contributions levyed
upon the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Grand Duke
of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> many of the Territories of
the Pope, the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the other
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> this he puts into the Impe|rial
Trea&s;ury for the Support of $his War,
whil&s;t yet it is depending; and all this is,
be&s;ides the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Parts of the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy as are obtaind for him,
with the Blood, and at the Expence, of the
Confederates; &s;uch are the Provinces of the
<HI>Low Countries,</HI> the Rich Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> the
Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Principality of <HI>Cata|lognia,
&amp;c.</HI> except only the Expence of the Em|peror
in gaining and maintaining the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
of the la&s;t of the&s;e Places. Two Things will
appear eviden tin this, in which the true Rea|&s;on
of the Emperors de&s;iring the Continuance
of the War may be found. 1. That except
the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Conque&s;ts of
all tho&s;e Countries are the Effect of the
Trea&s;ure, as well as Power, of the Confe|derates,
and have been reduced chiefly at
their Expence. 2. That the prodigious Re|venues
of tho&s;e &s;everal Countries put much
more Money into the Coffers of the Em|peror
than has been expended by him in
the Support of the War, (the pre&s;ent Year
excepted,) and has gone plenteou&s;ly into
the Coffers of the great Officers, Courtiers,
and the great Army of Dep$ndants, who
<PB N="29" REF="30">
always hang on upon the Imperial Courts,
who&s;e Voratious Avarice not the whole
Monarchy of <HI>Spain,</HI> no, or of the World,
can &s;atisfie. This is that which has &s;o
many Years been the Complaint of other
Nations as the true Rea&s;on why no Peace
could be made in <HI>Hungaria;</HI> not all the
Confederates could prevail by the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing Importunities upon the Imperial
Court to grant Peace to the Poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Prote&s;tants, becau&s;e the Courtiers and
Clergy at <HI>Vienna</HI> had gotten &s;uch large
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Revenues and E&s;tates of the
Malecontents, which they knew on the
clo&s;e of the Troubles they mu&s;t be obliged
to refund, and which they re&s;olved never
to part with &s;o long as they could be detain|ed,
that the Mi&s;eries of that Countrey could
never find an End, but in Conque&s;t and
Depopulation: And &s;uch hath been the
Deva&s;tation in that poor Kingdom, that
they have not now People left to fill and
cultivate the Land, in a Place, once the mo&s;t
Populous Countrey of <HI>Europe,</HI> for which
Rea&s;on they now invite the Boors of
<HI>Suabia</HI> to go and &s;ettle there, that the
Landlords may have Tenants to occupy
their Lands: This is a mo&s;t Remarkable
Event, a Thing no War with the <HI>$urks</HI>
could ever bring to pa&s;s, altho' tho&s;e Wars
are very De&s;olating al&s;o.</P>
<P>Come we next to the other Bran$$ of the
Oppo&s;ers of Peace, as &s;uch; the $word$ the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Party at Home here among our&s;elves; i$
needeth very little Cunning to $word$
or Penetration to dive, into the $word$
Rea&s;ons of the Oppo&s;ition made $word$
Peace; that is to &s;ay, the violent Oppo|&s;ition
of Parties; the Ca&s;e is &s;o Nak$d
any Eye may &s;ee it; the Di&s;pute here is
all for Management and Superiority; the
New Mini&s;try propo&s;e putting an End to
the War; the Outed Party &s;ee, that if
the Peace is made the New Mini&s;try will
be e&s;tabli&s;hed by that Means, and be be|yond
the Power of them and their Intere&s;t
to &s;hake them; they apply therefore with
all their Might to oppo&s;e a Peace, as that
in which they find the Ruin of their Party
infallibly contained.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Oppo&s;ers of Peace are un|der&s;tood
of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e it not on
Account of the Conditions, but as a Peace;
the other Allies, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the King of <HI>Partugal,</HI> &amp;c. the&s;e
are &s;uppo&s;ed only to have their Views at
the Conditions on which a Peace may
be obtained, &s;uch as the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
Barrier in <HI>Flanders,</HI> a Tariff of Trade,
and the like, for the <HI>Dutch;</HI> the Recovery
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and Security of the Po&s;ts and
Vallies to the <HI>Savoyard;</HI> the Articles of
the late Treaty, and the Affairs of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI>
to the <HI>Portugal;</HI> the&s;e Things granted,
the&s;e Allies would be &s;oon reconciled to
a Peace, not regarding who, or by what
<PB N="31" REF="32">
lands it was made; but with the other
$t is not &s;o: The &s;trict and newly &s;ettled
Confederacy between the former Poten|tate,
and a Party here, has no Di$ficulty
in it, after the Rea&s;ons why they re&s;pe|ctively
are obliged to oppo&s;e all Peace,
as &s;uch, are thus examined; if there is any
Thing W$$derful in the Conjunction, it
mu&s;t be to &s;ee a Sovereign Court of the
Fir&s;t Magnitude, a Head, containing the
Fir&s;t Figure in the Chri&s;tian World, &s;toop|ing
to concert Mea&s;ures with a Faction,
and to &s;upport a Di&s;affected Party, who&s;e
Views are not only contemptible, but
are obnoxious to, and the Aver&s;ion of,
their Sovereign; $omenting a Di&s;tracted,
Outed, and De&s;perate Party, again&s;t their
Prince, and again&s;t a Prince to whom the
&s;aid Court are under In&s;inite Obligations;
to who&s;e Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity the
Emperor very much owes the Crown
he enjoys. This may give &s;ome Surprize
to the World, though, as Things go
among &s;ome Confe$$erated People, no|thing
is to be e&s;teemed Wonderful; nor
is there any Thing &s;o &s;trange in the World
but it may be expected from the&s;e People,
except it be that very N$w and Unknown
Thing, of which Authors have lately en|deavoured
to make &s;ome De&s;cription,
called <HI>Imperial Grvtitude.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus a little enquired into the
&s;everal Circum&s;tances, which have brought
<PB N="32" REF="33">
the Publick Matters to their pre&s;ent State,
it will &s;erve the better to explain the
other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Manag$men$ which
remain: Can any wonder or reflect that
having to do with an enraged Faction,
and with Foreign Powers, who, how|ever
differently moved, concur in project|ing
the De&s;truction of their Countrey,
and aim at carrying on the War which
mu&s;t end in the General Calamity; the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court &s;hould take Mea&s;ures to de|feat
t$is Danger us Principle, and to di&s;|appoint
the Cruel and Bloody Projects of
tho&s;e who value not the Blood of Millions
of People, &s;o their private Intere&s;ts and
De&s;igns are carried on: To this Purpo&s;e,
finding the Oppo&s;ition to all Publick Trea|ties
carried on with &s;o much Malicious Vi|olence,
and a Confederacy of Intere&s;ts op|po&s;ing
the true In $word$ of Her Maje&s;ty's
Subjects, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to take &s;uch M$a&s;u$es, as that the po&s;i|tive
Intere&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> may be &s;ecured,
whether tho&s;e People think &s;it to join, or
no; at the &s;ame Time actually doing Right
to the whole Confederacy, and leaving
them full Space to find their Account in it,
who are not infatuated by Heaven for their
own Puni&s;hment and De&s;truction: This,
however whole&s;ome for the whole Body,
admitted not of being done &s;o, as that
tho&s;e, who, for the Rea&s;ons above, were
bent to circumvent and de&s;troy all Attempts
<PB N="33" REF="34">
towards healing the Wounds of <HI>Europe,</HI>
might be in a Con$ition to practice
upon it, as they had done before. This
the Party here make loud Complaints of,
and hence began the popular Reports,
and individuons Complaints, that there
was a Private Clande&s;tine Treaty carried on
with <HI>France</HI> to the Prejudice of the Alliance,
and without the Concurrence of the Con|federates,
contrary to the Grand Alliance,
and in Prejudice of the &s;everal Powers con|cerned
in the War with <HI>France;</HI> whereas,
were this rightly examined, the Truth of
the Ca&s;e is no more than this, that a Party
Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion being entred into the Heads of
tho&s;e People, who ought to have been bet|ter
Judges of the Publick Good, and almo&s;t
every Branch of the Confederacy having
in their Turn either acted in Prejudice of
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, or &s;tood &s;till, and &s;uf|fered
them&s;elves to be made Parties to tho&s;e
that did &s;o, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
was obliged to take Her Intere&s;t, and that
of Her Kingdoms, into Her own Hands,
and having at the &s;ame Time a due Regard
to the Safety and Security of Her Allies,
and e&s;pecially an exact Eye upon the Stipu|lations
of Her Leagues and Confederacies
with others, to attempt by Her&s;elf the re|&s;toring
the Tranquility of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It is no more to be wonder'd at, that all
the Parties who having hitherto made their
Merchandi&s;e of this Nation, and who
<PB N="34" REF="35">
thought we were the <HI>Dupes</HI> of their Pro|jects
and Schemes, of whom they were &s;till
to make Advantage, were &s;ecretly Nettled
and Re&s;tle&s;s when they &s;aw them&s;elves di|ve&s;ted
of the Influence they formerly had
over our Affairs, than it might be won|der'd
at, that a Man having gain'd a great
Prize from another, &s;hould be unwilling
to part with it again; they had no Re|cour&s;e
but to Clamours and ince&s;&s;ant Rail|ing
at the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Management, unju&s;tly
reproaching the Queen with having be|tray'd
the Alliance, that is to &s;ay, having
re&s;cued Her&s;elf and Her Nation from being
made a Prey to Ten Friends, under Pretence
of reducing One Enemy; it has been their
e&s;pecial Grievance, that Her Maje&s;ty hath
been obliged, in Her own Defence, to ex|po&s;e
to the World the Scandalous U&s;age
She hath had from the&s;e Her Allies: Tne
Deficiency of their Quota's, the Fallacious
Con&s;truction of their &s;everal Conventions
and Agreements made for mutual A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
the Weak and Unju&s;t Pretences they
have made u&s;e of to excu&s;e or extenuate
their not &s;upplying Money, Troops, Ships,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in due Proportions to what Her Maje&s;ty
has done; the&s;e Things they hoped to have
concealed, and to have thus carried on the
Game of the War to &s;uch length as might
have &s;erved their own Ends; in which it
appears too evident, that <HI>Britain</HI> had al|ways
the labouring Oar, <HI>viz.</HI> the Expence
<PB N="35" REF="36">
without the Advantage under this U&s;age,
the Government at pre&s;ent &s;uffers, and the
Queen being happily re&s;tored to &s;earch the
Bottom of Things, and, as above, taking
the Management of Her own Peace into
Her own Hands, it is &s;carce Credible, nor
will Po&s;terity believe it, what Treatment
Her Maje&s;ty meets with, as well from Her
Allies Abroad, as more e&s;pecially from a
Furious and Raging Party at Home; what
Reproaches on Her Per$on, and on tho&s;e
who are thought fi$ to be entru&s;ted in Her
Affairs; Mini&s;ters of State have often been
Maligned and Maltreated, and as often for
faithful doing their Duty as for any Thing;
but never were any treated like the&s;e;
never did any Prince bear &s;uch Indignities
in the Per&s;ons of Her Servants as Her Ma|je&s;ty
now does, and all this too upon bare
Suppo&s;ition; before the I&s;&s;ue of Things is
brought on, before Things are come to Con|clu&s;ions,
or the Matters of Fact appear.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this is rather to &s;earch in|to
the Practice of the Enemies of our Peace,
than to vindicate Her Maje&s;ty, or Her Mi|ni&s;try;
they want no Aid of that Kind, the
I&s;&s;ue of Things will be their Vindication:
They go on &s;teadily with their De&s;igns in
Defiance of all the&s;e, giving us &s;till Hopes
that all will i&s;&s;ue in the Publick Good, and
in that Firm, La&s;ting, Peace which <HI>Europe</HI>
wants &s;o much, and w$i$h the&s;e very Men
are to be happy in $word$ &s;o much oppo&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="37">
it, and malign the Government for endea|$ouring
to make it.</P>
<P>The Intrigues of the&s;e People bring us
down, as before, directly to the Ca&s;e now
&s;o exclaim'd again&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI>) the Queen ha|ving
given Her Generals Order not to act
offen&s;ively again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> and what can the
Enemies of the Public Peace &s;ay to this? Had
not Her Maje&s;ty done this, all their Con|trivances,
and all the Intrigues at <HI>&V;trecht,</HI>
the <HI>Hague,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, had been
brought to Perfection, and their Plot had
had its de&s;ired Effect; it has all along ap|pear'd
to tho&s;e who have had the lea&s;t
Power of &s;earching into the&s;e Affairs, that
the De&s;igns of tho&s;e People, who pretend|ed
to meet at a Treaty, were only to delay
and &s;pin out the Negotiations in length,
loading the Treaties with Difficulties, and
&s;tarting unrea&s;onable Scruples and Ob|jections,
that the Sea&s;on advancing, and
the Time for Action coming on, the Ar|mies
might be in the Field, and the War
might have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>According to this Plot they went
on, they obtain'd to impo&s;e the De|mand
of An&s;wers in writing upon the
<HI>French,</HI> which they knew gave the u&s;ual
advantage to the Trea$y, by which for|mer
Treaties $span$ just to a
P$$iod of doing $span$
came on&punc; they $span$
have been
<PB N="37" REF="38">
$micably adju&s;ted, and by which the Plenipote$|$iaries
might &s;oone&s;t have come into the Bottom
of the Re&s;pective Demands, and &s;o have directly
treated on the Whole, by which a &s;peedy Conclu|$ion
might have been made, either for Peace or
War, which was the true Intent and Meaning
of Her Maje&s;ty in obtaining a Treaty: But the&s;e
People to whom the Thoughts of Peace was hate|ful,
as the Thing it&s;elf appear'd Fatal to their Mea|&s;ures,
oppo&s;ed all the Ju&s;t Mea&s;ures taken to bring
Things thus to a Conclu&s;ion, building all their
Hopes upon this Suppo&s;ition, that if they could
bring the Armies to$ether, the War mu&s;t go on of
Cour&s;e; it is a&s;toni&s;hing to think the&s;e People
&s;hould be &s;o weak to believe that the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hould &s;end Mini&s;ters of &s;o little
Penetration to the Treaty, that they &s;hould not &s;ee
when they were thus trifled with; or that they
&s;hould think when it was &s;een, and di&s;covered, Her
Maje&s;ty &s;hould not take effectual Mea&s;ures to pre|vent
them; that they &s;hould imagine that &s;uch
Dealing was not in the highe&s;t Manner di&s;obliging,
and that when it &s;hould be di&s;covered it would not
&s;erve to open the Eyes of Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, and
fill them with ju&s;t Indignation at &s;eeing their Sove|reign,
and the whole Nation, in &s;o gro&s;s a Manner
abu&s;ed; but be that as it will, they have not,
Thanks be to God, found the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court &s;o ea&s;ie,
or &s;o at a lo&s;s, to take their own Mea&s;ures, Her
Maje&s;ty having &s;oon re&s;olved not to leave Her Amba&s;|&s;adors
and Servants there to be thus treated, ordered
the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> to come away, and has, by o|ther
Hands, given the States Occa&s;ion to know how
She has Rea&s;on to re&s;ent this Treatment.</P>
<P>And yet what is it this Re&s;entment amounts to?
Hitherto it amounts to little more than Negatives,
<HI>viz.</HI> No to gratifie the De$igns of tho&s;e who would
either prorract the Wa$ declaredly, by refu&s;ing
the mo&s;t Ju&s;t Conditions of Peace, or Artificially, by
pu&s;hing Her Maje&s;ty upon pro&s;ecuting the War even
before it had been tried whether the Enemy would
yield to Honourable Terms, or no;&endq; to let them
&s;ee therefore that Her Maje&s;ty is not to be u&s;ed as
<PB N="38" REF="39">
She has been any longer, and that whatever they
think fit to do in the Affair, Her Maje&s;ty ought not
to be obliged to take Her Mea&s;ures $word$ them, more
e&s;pecially when it is &s;o evident that tho&s;e Mea&s;ures
are &s;o directly contrary to the true $e&s;ign of the
War, and the General Good of <HI>Europe;</HI> for the&s;e
Rea&s;ons Her Maje&s;ty has thought fit to forbid Her
General joining in carrying on an Offen&s;ive War; at
the &s;ame Time letting the Allies know, that Her
Maje&s;ty having Rea&s;on to think Her&s;elf ill u&s;ed in
the Affair of the Treaty, and that all Parties did not
come thither equally di&s;po&s;ed to bring the &s;aid Trea|ty
to the Happy de&s;ired Conclu&s;ion of an Honoura|ble
Peace, that therefore Her Maje&s;ty finds Her&s;elf
obliged to take Care of the Safety and Peace of Her
own Dominions, and of the Happine&s;s and Intere&s;t
of Her own Subjects, already &s;ufficiently exhau&s;ted
by the length of the War, as well as by the unequal
Share of the Burthen which they have hitherto borne,
and which has very unju&s;tly been put upon the Al|lies,
and unwarily &s;ubmitted to by tho&s;e whom
Her Maje&s;ty has formerly entru&s;ted with the Di|rection
of tho&s;e Affairs.</P>
<P>And let any Impartial Con&s;idering Man tell us
what could Her Maje&s;ty do le&s;s, in common Ju&s;tice
to Her Faithful Subjects, who&s;e Pre&s;ures have been
&s;o great, and who have &s;o chearfully&punc; &s;o long, and
&s;o patiently, borne the Burden of this war? Had Her
Maje&s;ty found Her Allies &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to a
Treaty, and to enter into the particular Demands
for nogotiating a Public and General Peace, it is
certain that the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> was heartily
and entirely bent to have procured a general Sati&s;|faction
to all the Allies, and was di&s;po&s;ed to have
concerned Her&s;elf in their Safety and Intere&s;t equally
with Her own; but finding Her&s;elf treated as a|bove,
She is ju&s;tified before God and Man in taking
Care of the Intere&s;ts of Her own People, leaving
tho&s;e who Delight in War to carry it on by them|&s;elves,
till Time, and their own Experience, &s;hall
open their Eyes.</P>
