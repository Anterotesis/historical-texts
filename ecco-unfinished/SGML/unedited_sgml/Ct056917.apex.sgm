<HEAD>PREFACE, Directed to tho&s;e who are for Carrying on this WAR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are not here enquiring into, or ma|king Reflections upon, tho&s;e who for private Ends of their own, whether Party Ends, or Per&s;onal, are, or have been, for prolonging the War.</P>
<P>The popular Objection is, that we are bound not to enter into any Treaty with the Enemy without Con&s;ent of our Allies, and the fir&s;t and Principal Per&s;on in the Alliance is the Em|peror, who refu&s;es to come to this Treaty or to make Peace with <HI>F ance,</HI> and without him you ought not to attempt it.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons why the Emperor in&s;i&s;ts thus again&s;t a Treaty are needle&s;s to be Di&s;cour&s;ed, &s;ince his An&s;wer is po&s;itive; and as his Impe|rial Maje&s;ty Expre&s;&s;es in his l etter to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> quoted in the&s;e Sheets, his Re&s;olution for the War is irrevocable. Now
<PB REF="3">
what &s;ignifies Di&s;cu&s;&s;ing Rea&s;ons, when the Party declares him&s;elf fix'd, and irrevocable?</P>
<P>The following Sheets are a brief Calculation of the Conduct and the Management of our Glorious Ally, the Emperor particularly in his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Capacity, from whence the Reader, by drawing &s;uch Inferences as are &s;uitable to the Honour of his Queen, and his Country, and tho&s;e who would continue the War, purely to gra|tifie, &s;erve, and oblige, an Ally, may &s;ee here what they have to expect from him, and for what kind of Treatment the Blood and Trea&s;ure of this Kingdom, which they would &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;tow, is to be expended. It is hoped the Con&s;idera|tion of this may a little move them, which if it &s;hould, the Author of the&s;e Sheets will think the Time and Labour very well be&s;towed.</P>

<HEAD>Imperial Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>THE Title of this Book &s;eems &s;o well to direct the Reader to the De&s;ign, that it &s;tands in need of very little Introduction. The Endea|vour us'd of late to extol and advance the Intere&s;t and Conduct of the Emperor, as the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable of the Allies, and Powerful enough to do Great Things of him&s;elf, &s;o as to make his pre&s;ent Conduct the Rule by which to direct and judge of Publick Affairs, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire a little into the&s;e Things; and &s;tate them indifferently to the World, that Peo|ple may no more be impos'd upon about them: To which Purpo&s;e we are at pre&s;ent to enter a little into the Conduct of the Per&s;on now &s;itting on the Imperial Throne in his pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Capacity, confi|ning our Enquiry, however particularly, to what relates to him as an Ally, and as his Conduct re&s;pects Her Maje&s;ty, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
Previous to this it may fall in our Way to enquire or &s;peak a little of the la&s;t Emperors Father and Brother, to the Pre&s;ent, and of the Empire it&s;elf, of both only with Re&s;pect to the Grand Alliance, and the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Sub&s;equent to this it may fall in the Way to &s;ay &s;omething to the Conduct of Her Maje&s;ty, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as it relates to the Per&s;on of the pre&s;ent Empe|ror, and the Intere&s;t of the la&s;t, and the Obligations which one of them may be under to the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things lead us to make this Book very much a Search into Hi&s;tory, and will fill it with &s;ome Original Papers, which every one may not have &s;een; it will be obvious to every ob&s;erving Eye whether his Imperial Maje&s;ty has return'd a reci|procal Kindne&s;s, or &s;hewn a &s;uitable Re|&s;pect to Her <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty for the Kind|ne&s;s and Services he has received: In doing this we &s;hall only proceed to lay down Matter of Fact, without pa&s;&s;ing our own Judgment therewith: It &s;hall be in no one's Power to charge us with Indecency to, and Reflection on, his Imperial Maje&s;ty, the Application of all being left by Way of Que&s;tion to every Reader to make for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uit therefore of this Ju&s;t Enquiry, we mu&s;t, Fir&s;t, Enter a little into the Hi&s;tory of the Emperor, and Empire it&s;elf as it re|lates
<PB REF="6">
to the Grand Alliance, where without any Impartiality we &s;hall &s;ee, whether it has not been the con&s;tant Care and Concern of the Queen of <HI>England</HI> to promote the Intere&s;t of the Emperor, not as Emperor only, but even the Family Intere&s;t of the Emperor, as Head of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Te&s;timony we have of this, is in the very Beginning of the Grand Alli|ance, on which the pre&s;ent War was found|ed, and is now carried on; where the Intere&s;t of his Imperial Maje&s;ties Hou&s;e is made an E&s;&s;ential Article of the &s;aid Alliance; and no Peace is to be made till the Emperor receive Satisfaction for his Preten&s;ions to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> as in the Eight Article of the &s;aid Alliance is expre&s;s'd thus. <HI>An Equitable and Rea&s;onable Satisfaction to his Imperial Maje&s;ty for his Preten&s;ions to the Dominions of the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Monarchy,</HI> &amp;c. and the like in the Second Article. <HI>Vid.</HI> the Treaty.</P>
<P>It is to be noted here, that at the Time of making this Alliance, the <HI>French</HI> King having &s;et up his Grand&s;on <HI>Philip</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain</HI> upon the Preten&s;ions, and by &s;uch Arts and Management, of which Hi&s;tory is full; the Emperor having a ma|nife&s;t Right to the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and re&s;olving to put in his &s;aid Claim, prepared for War.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
The Confederates, who were every one preparing at the &s;ame Time to attack <HI>France</HI> for the New Attempts which he had made, in Breach of the <HI>Treaty of Partition,</HI> had every one their &s;everal Preten&s;ions. The <HI>Dutch</HI> for the Lo&s;s of their Barrier; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the Danger of their Com|merce, and the Setting up a Pretender; the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> his Offen&s;ive Treaties, and the like; and all were the more willing to put their Demands together, that they might mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in One General War and Confederacy: To this End a Congre&s;s was appointed at the <HI>Hague</HI> to concert their re&s;pective Claims, and form a <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> by which they might go on upon <HI>France,</HI> as a United Body, that one might not ta&s;te of good or bad Succe&s;s with|out the other. This was in the Year 1702.</P>
<P>When this Meeting was fir&s;t made, the Debate was not, who &s;hould, or &s;hould not, po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, this was not en|tred into in the lea&s;t; only in general a Sa|tisfaction was to be given to his Imperial Maje&s;ty for his Preten&s;ions, as above; and therefore tho&s;e Authors, who contend that this Satisfaction to be given his Imperial Maje&s;ty was nothing but putting the &s;aid Monarchy into his Hands, <HI>are &s;o far in the Wrong;</HI> and it was urged in the &s;aid Con|gre&s;s what was formerly in the <HI>Treaty of Partition</HI> made by King <HI>William. (viz.) That in Order to prevent too many Domini|ons</HI>
<PB REF="8">
<HI>falling into the Hand of any One Prince, therefore</HI>&mdash;&amp;c. (viz.) <HI>The &s;ame Per&s;on was never to be Emperor and King of</HI> Spain, <HI>or King of</HI> France <HI>and King of</HI> Spain, <HI>at the &s;ame Time;</HI> in Con&s;equence of which Debate, it was agreed, that the Emperor &s;hould take it for Satisfaction, that the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould be con&s;ign'd over by him, and be by the Allies engaged to the next Prince of his Hou&s;e, which was upon the Con&s;ideration before mentioned, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the <HI>Imperial</HI> Crown, and that of <HI>Spain,</HI> ought not to be at one and the &s;ame Time, in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on. This we mention here, not to concern this Tract in any of the Common Debates, which make &s;o much Noi&s;e in the Publick Prints; but as it nece&s;&s;arily comes to be mentioned here, in order to clear up the Point, how, and by what Means, the Per|&s;on of the pre&s;ent Emperor, being then Arch-duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and no more, came to be named to the Crown and Do|minions of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;on who named him fir&s;t, and who&s;e Schemes gave the fir&s;t Birth to this Propo&s;ition, was the <HI>Almirant de Ca&s;tile,</HI> a Prince of the greate&s;t Penetration into the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> and who was at this Time fled from <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Portugal,</HI> who&s;e Con|duct in tho&s;e Affairs was &s;o fatal to the <HI>French</HI> Faction, that Means was &s;oon found, as we have heard &s;ugge&s;ted, to convey him
<PB REF="9">
into another World. But as &s;oon as the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> (for then the Union was not,) receiv'd the Propo&s;al, Her Ma|je&s;ty e&s;pecially e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;t of this Young Prince, and by Her Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;o far concerned her&s;elf in his Behalf, as al&s;o with the other Confederates, that the &s;aid Arch-duke <HI>Charles</HI> was de|clar'd King of <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> 12th of <HI>September,</HI> 1703, <HI>N. S.</HI> by his Father, the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> afterwards Emperor; who for them&s;elves, and their other Heirs, &s;olemnly re&s;ign'd their Right and Claim to the &s;ame; and as the&s;e Things are not left upon Record to every Eye, it may not be improper to give you this &s;hort Abridgment of the Manner of it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Vienna, September</HI> 18th, 1703.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the <HI>12</HI>th of this In&s;tant, in the Morning, the Emperor and the King of the <HI>Romans</HI> Sign'd, and Swore, to an Act, by which they both re&s;ign'd all their Right and Claim to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, in Favour of the Arch-duke <HI>Charles.</HI> The &s;ame Day, about Four in the Afternoon, all the Privy-Councellors were &s;ummon'd to the Council-Chamber, where the Emperor, the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Arch-duke, were pre|&s;ent:
<PB N="7" REF="10">
At what Time the Emperor made a &s;hort Speech, importing, That the Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> being Extinct by the Death of the Deceas'd King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, that Monarchy with the Domini|ons annex'd to it, were devolv'd upon him; and therefore being importun'd by his Illu&s;tri|ous Confederates, and among the re&s;t, by the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to provide a Succe&s;&s;or to that Mo|narchy, he had thought fit to &s;end over to <HI>Spain</HI> his Second Son, the Arch-duke <HI>Charles,</HI> in order to be put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid King|dom, and the Dominions thereunto belonging. To which Purpo&s;e his &s;aid Imperial Maje&s;ty, and the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> had thought it requi&s;ite to make a Re&s;ignation of all their Right and Title to the Crown, &s;aving however to them&s;elves the Rights of the Empire; in Pur|&s;uance of which Re&s;olution, and Renunciation, they declar'd and acknowledg'd the &s;aid Arch-duke to be King of <HI>Spain.</HI> After the Empe|ror had concluded, the Chancellor of the Court read both the Acts of Renunciation, as well in Behalf of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, as of the King of the <HI>Romans;</HI> as al&s;o another Act on the Behalf of the Arch-duke, containing, as &s;ome &s;ay, his Acceptance of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Crown, and a relinqui&s;hing of all his Right and Claim to the Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in the Empire. Which done, the Emperor, and the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> re|pair'd to an Altar, erected at the End of the
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Room, where they &s;wore to the Religious Ob|&s;ervance of the Conditions and Stipulations of the &s;aid Act, as did al&s;o the Arch-duke for his Part, the Go&s;pels being pre&s;ented to their Maje&s;ty's by Cardinal <HI>Colonitz.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is acknowledged, that this was done at the In&s;tance of Her Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the latter was influenced by the <HI>Almirant de Ca&s;tile,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>And to give a Te&s;timony of the early Obligations of this Prince to Her Maje&s;ty, here follows the Tran&s;lation of a Letter, written by the Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> with his own Hand to Her Maje&s;ty, recommend|ing the New King to Her, as to his Mo|ther, acknowledging the Great In&s;trument Her Maje&s;ty had been in procuring that Honour to his Son, and expre&s;&s;ing what none indeed for ever after could doubt but would be found, in a Per&s;on of true Ho|nour; <HI>(viz.)</HI> a la&s;ting Obligation of Thank|fulne&s;s and Gratitude: We &s;hall make no Comment hereupon, the Thing &s;peaks it&s;elf; the Letter follows <HI>thus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Leopoldus, Imp. Semp. Aug. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ACcording to our Mutual Friend&s;hip, we do, by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, &s;ignifie to your Serenity, with a Friendly Affection, and in a Brotherly Manner, that Ye&s;terday, with the Con&s;ent of our Fir&s;t-born Son, the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> we conferr'd upon our other Son, the Arch-duke of <HI>Au&s;tria Charles</HI> the Third, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, legally de|volv'd upon us by the Death of the Illu&s;trious Catholick King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and did openly declare him King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> under God's Gracious Protection. This Matter has been long deliberated by us, and could not ea&s;ily be adju&s;ted, becau&s;e many Things offered them&s;elves to our Con&s;ideration <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> but while we were in Su&s;pence, the Judgment and Advice of your Serenity, &s;ignify'd to us by your Envoy Extraordinary, was of great Weight to remove our Doubts; and being mov'd in your Serenities Name to ha&s;ten this Declaration, and the Departure of our &s;aid Son, we did the more readily and willingly undertake it, becau&s;e we have al|ways found in your Serenity a great Fore&s;ight in giving and receiving Council, and a Faith|ful
<PB N="10" REF="13">
Performance of your Promi&s;es. We have al&s;o ob&s;erved in your Serenity &s;uch a particu|lar Affection and Good-will towards us and our Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that we firmly believe your Serenity will not only take what we have done in good Part, but will always regard it as your own Act. Our &s;aid Son would gladly &s;ig|nifie this to your Serenity, and expre&s;s our Joint Gratitude and Acknowledgment of it in Per&s;on; but &s;ince the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of the Common Affairs calls him further, he will perform this in another Method at his Arri|val. But may it plea&s;e your Serenity in the mean Time to allow us, &s;ince he is to leave us in a few Days, wholly to deliver him over, and to recommend him to your Serenity as to an|other Mother, with A&s;&s;urance on his Part, that as long as he lives he &s;hall honour your Sereni|ty with Filial Re&s;pect; and that our Family &s;hall ever be oblig'd to &s;erve your Serenity in the &s;tricte&s;t Manner, and in perpetual Grati|tude.

<P>Immediately upon the Declaration and Letter above&s;aid, the Young King is &s;ent by Land from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing from thence to <HI>England,</HI> we find him re|ceiv'd by Her Maje&s;ty with all that Good|ne&s;s and Bounty that &s;uited the fir&s;t Steps taken for his Advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
All this while it may not be ami&s;s to note, and it &s;eems mo&s;t proper to come in here, that his Young Maje&s;ty not only owed his Acce&s;s to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, to the Good-will, and particular A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, but even all the Title and Pretence he could make to the Crown, has al&s;o its Ri&s;e in Her Maje|&s;ty &s;ince nothing is more notorious, than that he had no Claim of Blood to that Crown, his Father, and his Elder Brother being both at that Time alive: But as one very happily Remarks on that Subject, he had no other Title to Claim by, but what made the Title of his Rival &s;tronger than his own. We are loth to mingle this Account with Quotations from other Authors, but the Argument brought to prove this, is thus abridged.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> had no Right to the Crown by De&s;cent, becau&s;e, tho' the Renun|ciation of the Treaty at the <HI>Pyrennees</HI> had been of no Force, his Father, and Elder Brother, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> were both Living, and the Title, if any, was theirs before him.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> had no Right to the Crown by De&s;cent, becau&s;e, tho' <HI>Philip</HI>'s Claim had been of no Force, yet his Father, and his Elder Brother, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> were both Living, and the Right was theirs be|fore him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
<HI>Philip</HI> Claims by Gift from <HI>Charles</HI> II. decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> Claims by Gift from the Empe|ror his Father, and King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> his Brother.</P>
<P>The Emperor &s;ays Crowns are not giv|en like Gloves, and Gold Rings, at Fune|rals; nor does a Right to Govern the Sub|jects of <HI>Spain</HI> de&s;cend by Will and A&s;&s;igna|tion, but by Right of Blood, and Lineal De&s;cent; and therefore <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> could not demi&s;e his Dominions to <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> &s;ays, if a Gift is not good, neither has <HI>Charles</HI> any Right more than he, who derives only from the Gift and Re&s;ignation of <HI>Leopold</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> his Father, and El|der Brother, who had no more Right to give it away, than <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>We &s;ay it &s;eems undeniable thus.</P>
<P>That if a Gift of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is not va|lid, neither of the&s;e Princes can make any Claim at all.</P>
<P>But if a Gift is Valid, then <HI>Philip</HI> has the be&s;t Title, becau&s;e his Gift was prior to the other.</P>
<P>There is an Additional Claim, which either Parties lay re&s;pectively to this Monar|chy, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that of the Sword; which indeed &s;eems to be the be&s;t Right either of them have to the Claim.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t indeed own a new Right &s;ince the&s;e de&s;cended to both, (1.) To King
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<HI>Charles,</HI> in that this Father, and Elder Brother, are both dead without other I&s;&s;ue Male. (2.) To King <HI>Philip, (viz.)</HI> that his Father be|ing dead, there remains no Succe&s;&s;or but the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who being to &s;ucceed to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> is not thought of: And Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a Title, which if then he can keep, it will be worth all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But to return to the Behaviour of this King <HI>Sine-Ter,</HI> in the Introduction to his New Dominion; where it &s;hould be noted, the Intent is not here to le&s;&s;en his Catho|lick Maje&s;ty, as if he had misbehaved; on the contrary, it is certain he did all that a Prince could decently &s;toop to do, to let Her Maje&s;ty know, that he knew how to acknowledge the Obligation he was under; and to let the World &s;ee, it was a King paying all that ju&s;t Re&s;pect to Her that made him &s;o, which a Prince full of Gratitude, and who under&s;tood both him&s;elf, and the Favour he had receiv'd, ought to pay.</P>
<P>For this, take the &s;hort View of his Beha|viour at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where he arriv'd 26 <HI>De|cember,</HI> 1703, Her Maje&s;ty receiv'd him at the head of the Stairs, where his fir&s;t Bow to Her Maje&s;ty &s;eem'd by all that &s;aw it, to &s;ignifie, that he meant to ki&s;s the Ground at Her Feet; there he made Her Maje&s;ty a very becoming Compliment, acknowledging his great Obligations to her, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">
We are the more willing to &s;et down the&s;e Particulars, tho' they may &s;eem tri|fling, becau&s;e they are thus far to the Ca&s;e in hand, as they &s;ignifie the Ju&s;t Sence his Maje&s;ty had then upon his Mind of his In|finite Engagements to the Genero&s;ity and Kindne&s;s of the Queen.</P>
<P>Let us now follow his Maje&s;ty into his own Dominions, and there we &s;hall find him, not only generou&s;ly on all Oc|ca&s;ions acknowledging Her Maje&s;ties Goodne&s;s and Bounty, as to obtaining for him the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> but often reduc'd even to entreat and &s;ollicit her Maje&s;ty, not only to &s;upport him in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but to re&s;cue him from his Enemies, who had be&s;ieged him in the only City of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the World; and where, but for Her Maje&s;ties Sea&s;onable and Pow|erful Succours, he had inevitably fallen into the Hands of his Enemies.</P>
<P>Here we find him &s;o long confin'd, &s;o low reduc'd, and &s;o like to be ruined, that the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI> in Deri&s;ion call'd him <HI>Il poco Rey de Barcelone,</HI> the little King of <HI>Bar|celona;</HI> and even after this Deliverance there we have him reduc'd &s;o low, as not to have even $$$ad for his Hou&s;hold, or as we may &s;ay, Shoes to his Feet, but from her Maje|&s;ties Bounty: As the&s;e Things ought not to be &s;aid of a Per&s;on now in the mo&s;t Supreme Degree of Human Dignity in the Chri&s;tian World, without &s;uch Evidence of Fact, as
<PB N="15" REF="18">

We have nothing to do with the Quarrel among them at that Time, or to enquire who were, or were not, to blame, the Ca&s;e &s;eems to be mo&s;t exactly Stated and Di&s;covered to the World in a late Book, Entituled, <Q>&startq;&endq;An Impartial Enquiry into the Management of the War in <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Mini&s;try at Home, and into the Conduct of tho&s;e Generals, to who&s;e Care the &s;ame has been committed Abroad; collected from many Original Letters, and Councils of War, never pub|li&s;hed before.</Q></P>
<P>Where all the Original Papers on either Side are at large recorded, and where, who|ever thinks fit to enquire, may &s;ee &s;ome|thing of a different Account from what mo&s;t Men have entertained of that Affair. This is to our Purpo&s;e, and for this Rea&s;on we
<PB N="32" REF="35">
mention the Matter, that Count <HI>Gallas</HI> in the &s;aid <HI>Memorial,</HI> to be &s;een al&s;o in the &s;aid Book, p&punc; 153, acquaints Her Maje&s;ty of the true Rea&s;on why King <HI>Charles</HI> did not go fa&s;ter on to <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the&s;e Words: <Q>&startq;&endq;His Catholick Maje&s;ty having from his fir&s;t coming into that Country, till that Time, received no more from the &s;aid Lord than once 10000 Crowns to mount the Regiment of <HI>Zinzendorf,</HI> 15000 <HI>Pi&s;toles</HI> at another Time for the Expence of the Siege of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and 5000 <HI>Dou|bloons</HI> for the Fortifications of <HI>Gironne;</HI> and being obliged to provide him&s;elf all that was nece&s;&s;ary in this unhappy Con|juncture, &s;aw him&s;elf reduced to &s;o de&s;|perate a Condition, that Far from being able to do what was re&s;olved on, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to march to <HI>Madrid</HI> by the Way of <HI>Valencia,</HI> he wanted even what was nece&s;&s;ary for the daily &s;upplying his own Table; and found him&s;elf &s;o loaded with Debts, that he had Rea&s;on to apprehend &s;ome Di&s;orders would en&s;ue, if he &s;hould depart without paying them.</Q></P>
<P>This is a lively Repre&s;entation of the Condition of this now &s;o Glorious Monarch, who refu&s;es to treat with the <HI>French</HI> at Her Maje&s;ties Invitation. But this is not all, let us go on, and &s;ee in what Humble Man|ner he lays his Ca&s;e at Her Maje&s;ties Feet, and implores Her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; you have it in
<PB N="33" REF="36">
the &s;ame <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> ju&s;t at the clo&s;e, in the following Words.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And as your Maje&s;ty will perceive by this Account, that his Catholick Maje&s;ties Condition, for want of Means, is brought to this, that he is in Danger every Mo|ment of &s;eeing him&s;elf abandoned not on|ly by his Troops, but even by the very Servants of his own Hou&s;hold, who for this Year and Half have not received the lea&s;t Payment, which cannot happen with|out rendering his Royal Per&s;on contempti|ble to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and without his lo&s;ing the Affection and Re&s;pect of tho&s;e, who hitherto have been the be&s;t and fa&s;te&s;t Friends, di&s;couraging tho&s;e whom he farther hoped to bring over to his Intere&s;t, and giving the Enemy all the Advantage they can de&s;ire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;His Catholick Maje&s;ty therefore flatters him&s;elf, that after &s;o many Favours granted him by your Maje&s;ty, you will not &s;uffer him to &s;ink under his Misfortunes, but will forthwith a&s;&s;i&s;t him with Money, to pre&s;erve him from all tho&s;e Extremities, wherewith both his Per&s;on, and the Common Cau&s;e of all the Allies are threatned.</Q></P>
<P>We have now brought the Emperor to his fir&s;t Journey to <HI>Madrid</HI> the latter End of the Year 1707 being a few Months before the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> his Dependance on Her Maje&s;ty in all his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, his being
<PB N="34" REF="37">
frequently relieved and &s;upported, and indeed con&s;tantly, whenever he was in any Exigence, by Her Maje&s;ties A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and his having no other Help; the&s;e are all &s;o clear that we cannot believe his Maje&s;ty will forbear to acknowledge it at any Time.</P>
<P>We might trace him through all the Sub|&s;equent Variety of his Fortunes, as the Battle of <HI>Almanza,</HI> the Succe&s;s at <HI>Balaguer,</HI> at <HI>$arrago&s;&s;a,</HI> and his Second March to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and his Retreat again after the Affair of <HI>Briheuga</HI> and might &s;well this little Tract to a great Volume with his own repeated Sollicitations to the Queen for Help, and Acknowledgments when re|ceiv'd; but the la&s;t mention'd may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now &s;alute him Emperor; what Influence Her Maje&s;ty and Her Allies have had in his Advancement, he has not yet indeed given us many Verbal Acknow|ledgments of, at lea&s;t that are made Pub|lick; perhaps we may live to &s;ee them farther demon&s;trated in a little Time.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Expence Her Maje&s;ty and Her People have been at to &s;upport this Prince merit &s;ome Con&s;idera|tion in the World, and may not very im|properly be &s;umm'd up to form this Ac|count, e&s;pecially &s;ince we are not &s;o much &s;tating an Account of Debtor and Creditor as to Money, but a Debt of Gratitude, and Ingratitude, in which the Money disbur&s;t, the Blood and Lives lo&s;t, in his Quarrel, and
<PB N="35" REF="38">
Services done for his Per&s;on, &s;tand on the one Side to his Debt in Account, and his Acknow|ledgments are the Vouchers to prove that Account. The Return, the Behaviour, the Compliance with Things rea&s;onable, &amp;c. are the Credit Part, or Di&s;charge, of the Account, and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee how they Ballance.</P>
<P>Nor is it any Plea in Bar of this Demand, to &s;ay that we carried on the General Quar|rel of the Confederacy, or that the War was not undertaken on his Account; for tho' that may be true in General, yet as to that Part of it carried on in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and with or about his Per&s;on, this cannot be denied to be carried on meerly to &s;erve, oblige, promote, and &s;upport, him in parti|cular, and none el&s;e.</P>
<P>How Fruitle&s;s the Succe&s;s, how Ex|pen&s;ive the Particular Service, and how Unhappy to <HI>Britain,</HI> and to all the Confe|deracy, that War has been; how much more to our Advantage it had been, that the Expence on that Side had been employ'd either in <HI>America, Italy,</HI> or <HI>Flanders;</HI> the&s;e Things, tho' all of them very well worth enquiring into, on many other Accounts, yet, as they are not to be plac'd directly to his Account, we purpo&s;ely omit; but as to the Account above let us enquire a little into the Particulars, and a long Account indeed we &s;hall find it; enough to make any Prince in the World remember the Ob|ligation
<PB N="36" REF="39">
as long as he liv'd; an Account of Trea&s;ure and Blood, which no Nation but ours perhaps could have disbur&s;t for him, and which, to be &s;ure, none but ours would have done in the Manner we have, without any Article or Condition of Repay|ment or Satisfaction.</P>
<P>And this is a Clau&s;e de&s;erves &s;everal Kinds of Ob&s;ervation. Well may King <HI>Charles,</HI> and the Emperor, his Father, call Her Maje&s;ty Mother; for the Treatment he has receiv'd from hence has gone beyond even the manner of Fathers in this Age; the King of <HI>France</HI> has not acted thus even with his own Fle&s;h and Blood, for he has &s;topped the Trea&s;ure of his Grand&s;on's Galleons more than once, and repaid him&s;elf out of them, for the va&s;t Stores of Ammunition, and Arms, and the Payment of Troops, &s;ent to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; nay, and if the Returns by their Merchants Ships from the <HI>South-Seas</HI> may be reckoned, &s;ome &s;ay he has been over-paid too: But <HI>England</HI> has acted upon another Foot, meer Care and Concern, truly Maternal, &s;eeking no Reward, articling for no Return, taking no Pledge or Security for Repayment. Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty might have asked the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Places as &s;hould be taken by Her Arms; &s;uch as <HI>Barcelona, Gi|braltar, Port Mahon,</HI> or even <HI>Naples, Mi|lan,</HI> or the like, to be con&s;ign'd over to Her for Payment, when the King &s;hould
<PB N="37" REF="40">
$e &s;ettled in his Dominions by Her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. She might have Capitulated for <HI>Cadiz,</HI> or the <HI>Havana,</HI> or &s;uch other Places, as might have been very much the Advantage of Her People, to hold till the immen&s;e Sums &s;hould be repaid, which were An|nually disburs'd for his Service. Nor were we &s;o Rich, or &s;o little in Debt to our Mortgaged Funds, that Ten Millions of Bullion in Specie, after the End of the War, would not have been both very u&s;eful, and very acceptable to us, to re&s;tore our Com|merce, and recover our Nation, and help lighten the Burthen which the&s;e Things have fa&s;tened upon the Shoulders of our Po&s;terity for &s;o many Ages to come.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Con&s;iderations have been of no Weight with us; the A&s;&s;i&s;tance received from hence has been &s;o generous, &s;o free, as not to give the lea&s;t Room to &s;ay we have impo&s;ed the lea&s;t Conditions upon him; Her Maje&s;ty has acted with &s;uch Frank|ne&s;s, all has been done with a Paternal Concern for him, neither Capitulating for, or expecting any Payment; all that can be &s;aid we ever Conditioned for was that Clau&s;e in the VIth <HI>Article</HI> of the Grand Al|liance, wherein it is &s;aid, <HI>It &s;hall be lawful for his Royal Maje&s;ty of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>and the Lords the</HI> States-General, <HI>by common Ad|vice, and for the Benefit and Enlargement of the Navigation and Commerce of their Subjects, to &s;eize by their Forces what Lands and Ci|ties</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="41">
<HI>they can, belonging to the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Domi|nions in the</HI> Indies; <HI>and what&s;oever they &s;o take &s;hall be their own.</HI></P>
<P>In it appears we are to have nothing till we can get it for our&s;elves, and even that, it &s;eems they never propo&s;ed we &s;hould do, e&s;pecially if it be true which an Au|thor lately Publi&s;hed, that when our Ex|pedition was fitting out to the River of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and that it was &s;ugge&s;ted to the la&s;t Emperor that we were going to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>&startq;&endq;Sure the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could not be &s;o In&s;olent.</Q> If this be true, (which however probable, yet we will not affirm,) it would but too clearly di&s;cover the Temper of the <HI>German</HI> Court to be far enough from the Gratitude which &s;ome People think them|&s;elves &s;ecure of.</P>
<P>But that this &s;eeming Demand of Grati|tude may not appear &s;o unrea&s;onable, it may not be improper to &s;tate a little, not what <HI>Britain</HI> may expect, but what <HI>Britain</HI> has done; let others judge what we ought, to expect, and what a Return Gratitude ought to make to a Nation, that has gone &s;uch a Length for them, and indeed the Sum in general is &s;o great, that unle&s;s the Parti|culars are a little &s;et down, Po&s;terity will think the Authors hereof &s;poke by Gue&s;s, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible any Thing like it could be true.</P>
<P><PB N="$$" REF="42">
Wherefore the following Account is &s;et down, that his Imperial Maje&s;ty, if he plea&s;es, or any one for him, may Revi&s;e, and look back upon the few &s;mall Matters that have been done for him, and the tri|fling A&s;&s;i&s;tance which this Single Nation has given him towards e&s;tabli&s;hing him on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, for Troops &s;ent to his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, the Expence whereof is &s;uch, that as it has been repre&s;ented to the Parliament; and as it is to be demon&s;trated in the Au|thor above recited, in his Book, <HI>The Impar|tial Enquiry,</HI> &amp;c. every Foot Soldier co&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, before he was &s;et on Shore in <HI>Spain,</HI> 26 <HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d. per</HI> Head Sterling, an Expence which would have made a loud Noi&s;e in other Countries, and which perhaps few even in this Country will believe till they have read the Parti|culars.</P>
<P>'Tis an Unhappy Reflection for this Poor Nation to think, that of above Sixty-five Thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> in particular &s;ent to <HI>Spain</HI> for the a&s;&s;i&s;ting this Grateful Prince, not many above the odd Five Thou&s;and are remaining alive at this Time, and how few of them may be likely to &s;ee their own Nation again Time may &s;hew us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, into this Number are not reckon|ed the Seamen or Marines lo&s;t or dead on board the Fleet in this Service: Nor is there reckoned into this any of the Charge
<PB N="40" REF="43">
of the Navy, which yearly amounts to above Two Millions, and mo&s;t of which is employed in the Service of the King o <HI>Spain,</HI> even in &s;o Servile a Manner, that our Men of War have been turn'd into meer Tran&s;ports and Store&s;hips for his Service; a Work we never let them be em|ployed in at home: But the King's Nece&s;&s;i|ties urging, &s;o Zealous has Her Maje&s;ty and her Officers been to put forward his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ties Service, that they have &s;tuck at nothing, nor made Difficulties, even of Things they are not allowed at other Times to do.</P>
<P>Here follows a Summary Account of the Forces at &s;everal Times &s;hipp'd from hence, and paid, rais'd, or hired by Her Maje&s;ty for his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ties Service, and of the Money rai&s;ed at &s;everal Times by Par|liament for that Service.</P>

We could hardly expect the&s;e Heads to be received by tho&s;e who have only enter|tain'd Common Notions of the&s;e Things, and were not the Particulars to be proved and confirm'd by proper Vouchers, as well in the Publick Offices where the Accounts are kept re&s;pectively, as in the General Ab|&s;tracts laid before the Parliament, we &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to have in&s;erted them here.</P>

<P>It would be too long here to Recapitulate the &s;everal Steps farther taken in their Inte|re&s;t of this Prince, and which make up the whole Hi&s;tory of his Election. How

the Confederates broke all the Mea&s;ures of the Campaign in <HI>Flanders,</HI> parted with a great Detachment of the Army, and there|by weakened the re&s;t, &s;o as not to be able to undertake the great De&s;igns they had projected for that Summer, &s;acrificing the whole Expence of the Campaign to &s;trengthen his Intere&s;t, and to make him appear &s;o Formidable on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as that the <HI>French</HI> could offer no Di&s;turbance to the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> or in any Mea|&s;ure Awe or Influence the Election.

<P>The&s;e Things, we &s;ay, it would be too tedious here to relate, wherefore we chu&s;e to refer the Reader to the Accounts of tho&s;e Things publi&s;hed in other Tracts, in all which the Share Her Maje&s;ty, and Her Allies, have con&s;tantly had in the Gran|deur and Intere&s;t of this very Grate|ful
<PB N="52" REF="55">
Monarch, have been plainly &s;et down.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Affair of the Trea|ty of Peace, in which the fir&s;t Beginnings of the Retribution, and &s;ub&s;equent Behavi|our of his Maje&s;ty, to his afore&s;aid Friends, is the Thing we are to enquire into.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;als of <HI>France,</HI> of which &s;o much Noi&s;e has been made, were in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> or thereabouts, made to Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty by the <HI>French</HI> King, and Sign'd by his Agent here, Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Me&s;nager;</HI> a Thing &s;o Publick, no far|ther Account needs to be given of it here; nor that the&s;e Propo&s;als were immediately communicated to the Mini&s;ters of all the Allies by the Queen's Order, that they might be &s;ent to their re&s;pective Prin|cipals, and their An&s;wers thereupon be ob|tain'd.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t News of this Matter came to the Knowledge of King <HI>Charles,</HI> a little before his Election, we find him at his Landing near <HI>Genoa,</HI> when he came from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf warmly to Her Maje&s;ties Amba&s;&s;ador, Mr. <HI>Chetwynd,</HI> when he waited on him on Board the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Fleet, to Compliment him upon his Arrival in <HI>Italy,</HI> in this Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="56">
<Q>&startq;&endq;That if the Queen proceeded in this Manner, he &s;hould be obliged to take Care of him&s;elf, and that the other Allies would do the &s;ame after his Example.</Q> <HI>Vide</HI> Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Hannover</HI> Memorial. P. 16.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t In&s;tance from whence we derive the Title of our Book, and which we think gives us &s;ome Idea of what we call IMPERIAL GRATITUDE. This Language &s;ounds a little har&s;h to the very Pen, after it has been writing &s;o ma|ny fine, &s;oft, and &s;mooth Things, as have hitherto &s;upplied the&s;e Pages; this is &s;ome|thing different from the Expre&s;&s;ions of, <HI>Ever bound to remember; Eternal Gratitude; overcome with Her Maje&s;ties Goodne&s;s;</HI> and the like; &s;o that one would think they could hardly proceed from the &s;ame Mouth.</P>
<P>But we are not to &s;top here, let us go on. The Propo&s;als of <HI>France,</HI> vulgarly and er|roneou&s;ly call'd Preliminaries, coming to his Maje&s;ties Hands, from his Amba&s;&s;ador Count <HI>Gallas;</HI> and the Propo&s;als of a Treaty at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> being made, be&s;ides that his Maje&s;ty thought not fit to expo&s;tulate it with the Queen immediately, let us &s;ee what Treatment the Queen, and the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, meets with from him, in his Letter to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the
<PB N="54" REF="57">
Princes of the Empire, and in his Letter to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> on the Subject of the &s;aid Treaty and Preliminaries; and tho' the&s;e Letters are long, we cannot content our&s;elves to omit them, becau&s;e of the dif|ferent Stile from what we have read and quoted before; and becau&s;e, as we pro|mi&s;ed in the Beginning of this Work, we &s;hall all along chu&s;e rather to quote you his Maje&s;ties own Words, than to give you the Comments and Explanations thereon, which however ju&s;t, may be more liable to Exception.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, we give you his Imperial Ma|je&s;ties Letter Circular, directed more imme|diately to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> but al&s;o &s;ent to all the Electors and Princes of the Em|pire, concern'd in furni&s;hing their Quota's to the War, as follows.</P>
<P>THAT his Maje&s;ty did not que&s;tion but that his Electoral Highne&s;s had been in|formed of the Preliminaries of Peace propo&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> a Copy of which is here &s;ubjoined, and was no le&s;s con|cerned than his Maje&s;ty, that at a Time when God had &s;o largely be&s;towed his Ble&s;&s;ing on the Arms of the Allies, and when there was ju&s;t Grounds to hope to reduce the Enemy within ju&s;t Bounds, for the &s;ecuring the Tran|quility of <HI>Europe,</HI> that Crown &s;hould offer &s;uch Propo&s;als, which had not only been hear|kened to at <HI>London,</HI> but had al&s;o been com|municated

in Form the <HI>9</HI>th of <HI>October</HI> to Count <HI>Gallas,</HI> Mini&s;ter of his Maje&s;ty, by a Secretary of State, and propo&s;ed in <HI>Holland</HI> as acceptable, with earne&s;t In&s;tances of entring into a Negotiation thereupon: That hitherto his Maje&s;ty had been unwilling to look upon this Precipitation as a departing from the Aim and Intention of the Grand Alliance, &s;eeing the Obligation the Allies are under, not to enter into any Negotiations of a &s;eparate Peace, is &s;ufficiently known by all the World, according to the Treaty of Alliance; and there|fore was rather enclined to believe, that the, had too ea&s;ily given Credit to the captious Pro|po&s;als of the Enemy, though they were not &s;o well varni&s;hed as others have been; for every one perceived at fir&s;t Sight that hardly any one Thing in them was clearly expre&s;&s;ed, and that the Enemies De&s;ign was to gain Time by a long Negotiation, as well for recovering them&s;elves, as for dividing the Allies, which they have endeavoured to do a long Time &s;ince; that it was not difficult to fore&s;ee the Con&s;e|quences, if Men would only con&s;ider with At|tention, that &s;ince, with &s;o great Effu&s;ion of Blood, and unconceivable Expence, the united Forces of the Allies have not yet been able to obtain the Principal End of the War, that is, the common Security and Tranquility of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> what more can be expected from a &s;epa|rate Peace, or its Fxecution, than what has happened, in Re&s;pect to the Solemn Oaths of the Renunciation at the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and other En|gagements,
<PB N="$$" REF="59">
which were to be perpetual, and e&s;pecially when the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall be Ma&s;ters of the Forces of <HI>Spain, Indies,</HI> and all the Commerce.</P>
<P>As for us, <HI>(continues the Emperor,)</HI> we hope the contrary, and are entirely per&s;waded that you will be of the &s;ame Opinion, in&s;omuch, that you will not only oppo&s;e tho&s;e De&s;igns that are pernicious to the Common Cau&s;e, accord|ing to your Renowned Zeal for your Country, but al&s;o that you will powerfully u&s;e your great Credit with the Electors and States of the Empire, and al&s;o with the States-General of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> and other Allies, as we affectionately de&s;ire of you, by the near Tie of Blood there is between us, that you may all per&s;evere together in the Engagements of the Alliance, and in the nece&s;&s;ary &V;nion, for obtaining an Advantagious and Solid Peace, and that in <HI>England</HI> they may, following this laudable Example, de&s;i&s;t from any Thoughts that are contrary, and entertain &s;uch as are conformable thereto.</P>
<P>In the mean Time we have taken an irre|vocable Re&s;olution to undergo whatever may come of it, and to exert all our Efforts for the Good of the Common Cau&s;e, expo&s;ing even our own Per&s;on, rather than con&s;ent to the &s;ending of any one in our Name, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a Partial Negotiation, entirely ruinous to our Dear Country, and the Liberty of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and which we could not an&s;wer to our Archdu|cal Hou&s;e.</P>

with great Artifice, and altogether &s;uch as mu&s;t be expected from an Enemy, for they con|tain nothing but what is dubious and equivo|cal; and if one takes the Pains to examine thoroughly the Sence they impart, in&s;tead of the indefinite Terms which appear at the fir&s;t View, one will clearly find therein the Lo&s;s which can never be &s;ufficiently deplored of, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; for which only, and for pre&s;erving it in our Imperial Family, and at the &s;ame Time for maintaining the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> this War was underta|ken; Ten Years have been &s;pent in Fight|ing, and &s;o much Blood &s;pilt, &s;o that nothing more di&s;mal, and more fatal, could happen in the World.</P>

Fur|thermore, &s;hould the War continue in &s;uch a Manner, that the Enemy, already weakned by his ill Succe&s;&s;es, &s;hould come at la&s;t to be a Victor, yet it would be &s;till unpardonable to con&s;ent to &s;uch unju&s;t Preliminaries.</P>

<P>We mu&s;t conclude the&s;e Remarks with de&s;cending to a brief Hi&s;tory of Fact, as it now relates to the Peace, and the Con|duct of this Grateful Per&s;on to Her Maje&s;ty, in the Negotiations that are now on Foot: Pur&s;uant to the irrevocable Determination of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> we find him refu&s;ing, even before he is ask'd, the Fir&s;t Que&s;tion, or Propo&s;al, his Great Maternal Benefac|tre&s;s, the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> was like to make to him; and after the Propo&s;al was made to him from the Queen, by an e&s;pecial Me&s;&s;enger, which carried Her Ma|je&s;ties
<PB N="62" REF="65">
Letter, written to all the Allies, his Imperial Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer, for he was now Elected Emperor, contain'd a po&s;i|tive Denial to come to any Treaty, or to &s;end any Plenipotentiaries to the Congre&s;s at <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> The Ju&s;tice and Equity of the Denial turns upon Two or Three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice of Her Ma|je&s;ties Reque&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Obligation upon his Imperial Maje&s;ty, to the Per&s;on of the Queen, and to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court propo&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Weight of the Rea&s;ons alledged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>(viz.) the Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice of Her Maje&s;ties Propo&s;al,</HI> is be&s;t to be &s;een by the Propo&s;al it&s;elf, and that is expre&s;t in the &s;aid Circular Letter, which was &s;ent, as by its Title appears, to all the Princes concern'd in the Grand Alliance, of whom his Imperial Maje&s;ty was not only one, but the Chief; the Letter is as fol|lows.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King having ac|quainted us with his De&s;ire to &s;ee the Quiet and Tranquility of <HI>Furope</HI> re&s;tored, by a Safe and Honourable Peace for us, and all our High Allies, and having made &s;ome Offers to
<PB N="$$" REF="66">
di&s;po&s;e us to the opening of Conferences for that Purpo&s;e, (which Offers have been communi|cated to all the &s;aid Allies,) and the States-Ge|neral having thereupon declared, that they are inclined, and ready to enter into a Negotiation for a Good and General Peace, and to join with us, for inviting the Powers engaged with us in the pre&s;ent War, to &s;end their Mini&s;ters and Plenipotentiaries to the Congre&s;s; and the Place and Time of which having been concerted with the Mini&s;ter of the &s;aid States-General, we have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to let you know, without any Lo&s;s of Time, that we have agreed to affix the Opening of the &s;aid Congre&s;s to the <HI>12</HI>th of <HI>January</HI> next, <HI>N. S.</HI> in the Town of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> as we have no other View than to put an End to this War by a Solid Peace, and in which every one of the Allies may find a rea&s;onable Satisfaction, we doubt not but you will be equally di&s;po&s;ed to contribute to the Advancement of &s;o Pious and Benefi|cial a Work. Wherefore we de&s;ire you to &s;end forthwith the Mini&s;ters whom you &s;hall appoint for that Purpo&s;e, that by the Time a|bove &s;pecified they may appear in the &s;aid Town of <HI>Utrecht.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, we think it convenient to acquaint you, that we have re&s;olved, in con|cert with the States-General, to &s;end our Mi|ni&s;ters to the Congre&s;s only in the Quality of Plenipotentiaries, and that they &s;hall not take upon them the Character of Amba&s;&s;adors, till the Day of the Signing of the Peace, in or|der
<PB N="$$" REF="67">
to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the Diffi+culties of the <HI>Ceremoniale</HI> and the Delay&punc; which might be occa&s;ioned thereby.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Letter, his Impe|rial Maje&s;ty refu&s;ed peremptorily to &s;end any Amba&s;&s;adors or Plenipotentiaries to <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> This we call denying to the Queen the fir&s;t Reque&s;t, or Propo&s;al, which Her Maje&s;ty made to him, notwith&s;tanding the Kindne&s;s and Concern &s;hew'd to him by Her Maje&s;ty in other, and on former, Oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>As to the Second Head, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Obli|gation upon his Imperial Maje&s;ty to the Per&s;on of the Queen, it may relate to the Queen Two Ways; fir&s;t, the Obligation of Gratitude for former Kindne&s;s &s;hewn him, and the Obligation of Ju&s;tice to the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Her Maje&s;ties Propo&s;al, which only &s;ignified a De&s;ire in the Queen to have his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and all the re&s;t of Her Allies, receive entire Satisfaction in the de&s;ign'd Treaty; all Her View there|in being, as She expre&s;t there, to make a Firm and Solid Peace, &amp;c. and that they &s;hould meet there to treat thereof, and &s;ee if it was po&s;&s;ible for them to agree about it.</P>
<P>Now, though the Obligations we &s;peak of upon his Imperial Maje&s;ty might not be rea&s;onably expected to be &s;ufficient to influ|ence him in the Matters of the Peace it&s;elf,
<PB N="$$" REF="68">
yet &s;ure, to the Ceremony of a Treaty, &s;omething might be argued; and it &s;eem'd to many, a Token of &s;mall Re&s;pect to Her Maje&s;ty, that the Emperor &s;hould &s;tand out from a Meeting only, when the fir&s;t Propo&s;al of that Meeting came from a Prince, which he had &s;o good Rea&s;on to think had his particular Intere&s;t at Heart; and a Prince, who had given him &s;uch convincing Proofs of it, by &s;uch a Series of Benefaction, as is the Subject of the fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>How &s;urprizing then mu&s;t it be to find, in&s;tead of this, &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions relating to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, &s;uch Arguments, im|plying a Diffidence in, and Re&s;olution to oppo&s;e all the Mea&s;ures taken for a Peace, and particular, a Determination to refu&s;e &s;o much as to oblige the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in the trifling Reque&s;t, of coming together to treat.</P>
<P>Had a Treaty been begun, and any Propo&s;als entred upon there, been contra|ry to the Intere&s;t, Inclination, or other Views of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and he had &s;tood out from a Compliance, he might then indeed have had a Pretence, he had his Rea&s;ons, his Intere&s;t, and his other Views, to have offered as Rea&s;ons, and whether they had been &s;ufficient, or no, the Liberty every one had to determine of that might have left it the Opinion of the World: But the Pretence of, and Right to
<PB N="66" REF="69">
make Objections, had been Ju&s;t and Re|&s;onable; but to refu&s;e to treat, to refu&s;e &s;o much as to &s;end Plenipotentiaries, or Amba&s;&s;adors, to hear what &s;hould be of|fered, and to judge whether it was &s;uffici|cient, or a ground of Satisfaction, yea, or no, this favour'd of too much Di&s;re|gard to the Propo&s;er, to come from any Prince who had own'd him&s;elf under &s;uch Engagements and Obligations to the &s;aid Propo&s;er, as his Imperial Maje&s;ty had done to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> and this the rather, becau&s;e it was rejecting, not a Ma|terial Thing, but a Circum&s;tance, a Point of Ceremony, a Thing frequently, and on many occa&s;ions, left by one Prince to ano|ther; and therefore the refu&s;ing this to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could but &s;ignifie &s;ome Diffidence, Di&s;tru&s;t and Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Refu&s;er of, and at the Propo&s;er; and what Rea&s;ons there can be for that in his Maje&s;ty, as it re&s;pects the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> let any one that has read the former Sheets of this Tract determine; indeed we cannot but think it &s;eems at lea&s;t to us very di&s;re&s;pectful; as to the Word ungrate|ful, we are loth to call it by &s;o har&s;h a Name; perhaps it may be the Manner by which tho&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Nations of the World expre&s;t their Gratitude for infinite Obliga|tions, and for Kindne&s;&s;es too great for them, by any other Method to requite; and this may the better &s;uit the Terms of our Title,
<PB REF="70">
and may be left on Record, as a true Te&s;t of what is called <HI>Imperial Gratitude.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the Third Head, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Weight of the Rea&s;ons alledged in Be|half of his Imperial Maje&s;ty for his refu&s;ing to treat, and the&s;e may merit &s;ome Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t</HI> we meet with in all the foregoing Letters, is that he cannot con&s;ent to treat on the Foot of the &s;aid Seven Preliminaries; many that &s;trove hard to defend his Impe|rial Maje&s;ty in his &s;tanding out, and refu&s;ing to come to treat, gave this as a Rea&s;on, that he did by no means pretend to object again&s;t a Treaty in General, but again&s;t a Treaty upon the Foot of tho&s;e Preliminaries, as Things altogether in&s;ufficient, and uncapa|ble of founding a Safe and Honourable Peace, and as Things which at their very fir&s;t View &s;eem'd to take it for granted, or at lea&s;t openly &s;ugge&s;t, the giving up the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Enemy. That if a Treaty were &s;et on Foot on the Preliminaries for|merly adju&s;ted, and upon Conditions &s;uitable to his Imperial Maje&s;ties Preten&s;ions, and to that Right he had to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, which was owned by all the Confederates, that then he was ready, in Concert with his Allies, &amp;c. but he could not enter upon &s;uch a Treaty as he under&s;tood this to be; what Mea&s;ures Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty took to open his Eyes in this Re&s;pect, and to &s;a|tisfie him that She did not under&s;tand the
<PB N="$$" REF="71">
Propo&s;als in &s;uch a Manner; that &s;he de&s;ired that his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould, as well as all Her other Allies, receive full Satisfaction in the Treaty, and the like; and how little &s;uch a Declaration was of Effect, to alter his Maje&s;ties &s;aid Re&s;olutions, or to encou|rage him to have Confidence in Her &s;aid Maje&s;ty, who had formerly been &s;o zealous for his Intere&s;t, and in whom he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed before &s;uch entire Confidence, we need not enquire.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Rea&s;on we meet with in his Maje&s;ties Repre&s;entations again&s;t this Trea|ty was the Ambiguity of the Expre&s;&s;ions, which being of <HI>double Entendre,</HI> doubtful Con&s;truction, and a various Signification, &s;hould be Con&s;trued in the Execution of them, to the Advantage of the Enemy, and tended manife&s;tly to amu&s;e and divide the Confederates; it may be confe&s;&s;ed, that had the&s;e Propo&s;als been the only Foundation, and that they were, as before, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Heads, to which the Plenipotentiaries were limited in their Treaty, there had been more to be &s;aid on this Head, but otherwi&s;e it &s;eem'd to argue &s;trongly, that a fair and open Treaty of a Peace was the only Way for all the Confederates to determine the direct Sen&s;e of every Article, to oblige <HI>France</HI> to explain her&s;elf upon any Point that might &s;eem ambiguous, and to remove all po&s;&s;ible Con&s;tructions which might be put upon them, to the Prejudice of any
<PB N="$$" REF="72">
Part of the Allies; and had his Maje&s;ty &s;po|ken or thought in this Ca&s;e, with the &s;ame Sentiments that he had appeared to &s;peak and think with before, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of an entire Confidence in, and Dependance upon, Her Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> from whom he had received &s;uch frequent and undoubted Evidences of a true and of a deep Con|cern for him, and for his Intere&s;t, we might rather have expected &s;ome Expre&s;&s;i|ons like the&s;e; <HI>Having an entire Confidence in Your Maje&s;ties good Affection to us, and to our Intere&s;t, which You have in &s;o many Occa|&s;ions, with &s;o generous a Concern, and &s;o much Goodne&s;s, &s;o many Ways expre&s;&s;ed; and that You will not &s;uffer any Thing to be done, agreed to, or granted, to the Prejudice of our Right, and the Lo&s;s or Dammage of our Intere&s;t, at the &s;aid Treaty,</HI> &amp;c. This, or &s;omething like this, had been all of a Piece with the re&s;t; and the Spirit and Vigour of a Mind obliged in the highe&s;t Manner, and &s;en&s;ible of the greate&s;t Favours, had appeared here, as it did in the Letters of the &s;ame Prince, formerly quoted: But his Maje&s;ty was not now Be&s;ieged within the Walls of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he was now Exalted to the Imperial Dig|nity; he was not now &s;urrounded by a <HI>French</HI> Army, and a Breach of Fifty Paces Wide made in the Fortifications he had to defend; he is now &s;urrounded with the Ac|clamations of the <HI>Germans,</HI> attended by in|numerable Crowds, and throng'd with a
<PB REF="73">
Concour&s;e of Princes, in&s;tead of a Formi|dable Fleet blocking him up by Sea, and his Rival ready to &s;eize him, and carry him in Triumph to <HI>Madrid;</HI> he is entring in Triumph the Imperial Cities of <HI>Germany;</HI> in&s;tead of the roaring of the Cannon from the Batteries in the Enemies Approaches, he hears the thundring of Cannon from the Ramparts of the Towns he pa&s;&s;es through; and in&s;tead of the Cries of the A&s;&s;ailants at|tempting to Storm the only City, he hears the Shouts of long Live the Emperor, <HI>Vive il Rey d' E&s;paign,</HI> and the like; and if the&s;e Things have altered his Stile a little, and cau&s;ed him to forget the Expre&s;&s;ions which formerly came with &s;o much Freedom from him in his Di&s;tre&s;s, we cannot &s;o much Wonder, &s;ince nothing is &s;o natural to the Con&s;titution of Man as to re&s;ent Injury, and forget Favours.</P>
<P N="3">3. We might in all his Repre&s;entations above&s;aid, ob&s;erve another Rea&s;on why his Imperial Maje&s;ty has thus &s;tifly, we had almo&s;t &s;aid ob&s;tinately, rejected a Treaty; and this is the clear View he &s;eems to have, that in &s;uch Treaty he may be required by his Allies to part with &s;ome Branches of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, either for the Satisfaction of his Allies, for the immen&s;e Expences, Lo&s;&s;es, and Dammages of the War, or for the more ea&s;ie inducing the Enemy, by a quiet De|mi&s;&s;ion to put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t, where that we may do Ju&s;tice to his Impe|rial
<PB N="$$" REF="74">
Maje&s;ty; it &s;eems that this Rea&s;on has not &s;o little Weight in it as &s;ome may think it has; particularly, that his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty may think he is now ve&s;ted with new Powers, and placed in a Station able to make a more powerful Figure in the Alli|ance than he has hitherto done; that the Efforts he &s;hall now make are &s;o con&s;iderable as ought to encourage the Allies to pu&s;h on farther, without Regard to the particular Intere&s;ts that may otherwi&s;e move them. We are loth to &s;ay that his Imperial Maje|&s;ty too &s;oon overlooks the exhau&s;ted Cir|cum&s;tances of mo&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particu|larly &s;ome Nations, e&s;pecially weakened and exhau&s;ted by their Zeal for his imme|diate A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that they are obliged to have no regard to any Thing but the fair Opportunity that now offers to re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h him in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New King|doms, not looking at all into their own. We are loth to look back into the Circum|&s;tances of the War, and give for Rea&s;ons, that the Weight of the War lying principal|ly upon the Confederates, and the Gain of any Conque&s;ts, or Acqui&s;tion, falling in General into the Hands of the Emperor; and that the Gain to the Emperor, by carry|ing on the War, is beyond all Compari&s;on, &s;o much greater than the Expence of his Part, that therefore it is not to be expected that &s;uch Forwardne&s;s for a Peace &s;hould appear on his Side, as tho&s;e States and
<PB N="$$" REF="75">
Princes might &s;how who have borne the Weight of that War, and have their Eyes fix'd only on the Native and Settled Advan|tages attending a Safe and Honourable Peace.</P>
<P>But come we therefore a little to enquire wherein the&s;e Rea&s;ons &s;eem not in&s;ufficient, only but a little unkind, with Re&s;pect to the Nations who have with &s;o much Can|dour and Genero&s;ity engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t and carry on his Imperial Maje&s;ty, and to who&s;e Influence he owes &s;o much, the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of his Affairs in their pre&s;ent Happy and Flouri&s;hing Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty had not given the lea&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion for his Imperial Maje&s;ty to think She would make a Separate or Di&s;advantageous Treaty; or that the Lo&s;s of <HI>Spain</HI> to his <HI>Imperial</HI> and <HI>Arch-Ducal</HI> Hou&s;e would be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Treaty; but on the contrary, as well by Her private A&s;&s;urances to all Her Allies, as in Her Speech to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, Her Maje&s;ty had given all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;uran|ces that She was re&s;olved at the &s;aid Treaty to obtain full Satisfaction to all Her Allies; and that She had their Intere&s;t at Heart, that She would enter into &s;uch Engagements with the Allies as &s;hould effectually &s;ecure and obtain &s;uch Satisfaction; and that She was re&s;olved, if &s;uch Satisfaction could not be obtained, to carry on the War with the utmo&s;t Vigour. This was &s;o clear a Decla|ration of the &s;incere Intentions of Her Maje|&s;ty
<PB N="73" REF="76">
in the View of a Peace, that immediate|ly gave Satisfaction, not only to Her own Subjects at Home, but to all the re&s;t of the Allies Abroad; and upon which imme|diately the Plenipotentiaries of the other Allies were nominated, and began to move towards the Place of the Treaty, and made ready for the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Farther than this, Her Maje&s;ty failed not to explain Her&s;elf upon the Affair of the Pro|po&s;als of <HI>France,</HI> That they were under&s;tood only as Propo&s;als, That it was Her Intention neverthele&s;s that all the Allies &s;hould enter into, as well their General as their parti|cular Demands, at the Treaty, and &s;hould Treat upon the Subject of their proper In|tere&s;ts and Satisfaction, as if no &s;uch Propo|&s;als or Preliminaries had been made.</P>
<P>It were too much to enter into all the particular Steps taken by Her Maje&s;ty in this Affair, to &s;atisfie, if po&s;&s;ible, all the rea&s;onable ju&s;t Scruples of his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty; and yet, after all, if we may be|lieve the Foreign Accounts, we find him &s;till diffident; that he has not yet agreed to &s;end his Plenipotentiaries; and, as tho&s;e Accounts &s;ay, that he expects a Declaration in Writing from Her Maje&s;ty, that tho&s;e Articles &s;hall not be treated on as Prelimi|naries, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If this be &s;o, tho', as we &s;aid before, we &s;hall not charge his Imperial Maje&s;ty with Unrea&s;onable Jealou&s;ies, Groundle&s;s Di&s;|tru&s;ts, and acting with le&s;s Regard to the
<PB N="74" REF="77">
Honour and Dignity of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Ma|je&s;ty, than he has ju&s;t Occa&s;ion given him to do; yet we cannot but repre&s;ent the&s;e diffe|rent Schemes to the View of every Impartial Reader, and laying one by the other, de|&s;ire and recommend it to them, to compare them together, and &s;ee if it can be imagin'd they can come from the &s;ame Hand; or that if they do, whether they are not very Sin|gular in &s;everal Things, and may not be very properly &s;tated to the World, and put into &s;uch Form, as the like may always be known by the Title given to this Book, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Imperial Ingratitude.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT has been laid down here needs very little Comment, you have a Scetch of the Conduct of a Confede|rate of the fir&s;t Magnitude in his various Changes and Circum&s;tances, and you have it laid down with no Deviation from Fact; the Ca&s;e, as it lyes before you now, is all Hi&s;tory, and the Reader is led to &s;uch un|que&s;tioned Vouchers, as it may be &s;ugge&s;t|ed will admit no Debate, <HI>Ex Ore Tuo</HI> is the Word; and truly, in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Con|cern as this, it &s;eems that no le&s;s Evidence ought to be admitted, for many Rea&s;ons, the Subject being of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, and the Per&s;on &s;poken of Supream in Dig|nity, the fir&s;t Potentate in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, by Way of Conclu&s;ion, to look a little from the Per&s;on we have
<PB N="75" REF="78">
been &s;peaking of, and to con&s;ider our own Circum&s;tances, to look before us, and en|quire what Mea&s;ures we ought to take, how the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court &s;tands obliged to act, and how to behave in the Affair of the Treaty, with Re&s;pect to a Prince that has acted by our Government, as before related.</P>
<P>It is a Thing Notorious, if we look back to con&s;ider this Prince as King of <HI>Spain,</HI> only that he is under Obligations to us, but we are under none to him; if we look back on him as Emperor, then he &s;tands on the Step from which the late Emperor, and his other Ance&s;tors, went off; in which Capa|city we may do no unnece&s;&s;ary Duty to ask on which Side lyes the Obligation.</P>
<P>In order to this Enquiry, it is not impro|per to propo&s;e to tho&s;e who are &s;o full of the Emperor's Merit as a Confederate, that they would let us &s;ee with what a kind of Concern, for the general Intere&s;t of the Al|lies, the Emperors have carried on the War, how they have &s;upplied their Quota's, how filled their Military Che&s;t, and their Maga|zines, and in what Po&s;ture they have been as to the War; let them give us a De&s;cripti|on of the Imperial Conduct, and &s;tate it with the Obligation which lay on that Court as a Confederate, and what the Al|lies ought to have expected from them. Let them enquire, and &s;et down for the Peru|&s;al of the World, what Share of Diver&s;ion to the Enemies Troops the Emperor has ta|ken upon him; let the Battles, the Sieges,
<PB N="76" REF="79">
the Armies on the <HI>&V;pper Rhine,</HI> be reckoned up&punc; and above all, let them &s;et down the Times of the Year when tho&s;e Armies gene|rally came into the Field, and when they left it, how far they march'd, how long they kept Garri&s;on in their Lines, and how well al&s;o they defended them when attack'd al&s;o by the <HI>French,</HI> with Forces not Superior to them.</P>
<P>It is much talked here now of what Great Forces the Emperor is preparing to bring in|to the Field, and tho&s;e who give rea&s;onable Accounts of them, (as for the extravagant Ac|counts of others they are worth no Notice in this Place,) make them 90000 Men, but the&s;e People forget to look back upon the Quota's, which in Con&s;equence of the Grand Alliance it was agreed the Imperial Court was to bring into the Field, and there it will appear that 91750 Men was the Compliment his Imperial Maje&s;ty was obliged to furni&s;h over and above the Troops of the Empire: Now if ever one half of the&s;e were brought into the Field, or appeared in Action, if ever the&s;e Capitulations were perform'd, let the&s;e Gen|tlemen &s;et down the Names of the Regiments, and where, and when, they &s;erv'd; if they had been in the Field perhaps the Work had not been left to do at this Time of Day; and if they have not been produced, then it re|mains to ask, whether it is rea&s;onable that we &s;hould carry on the War to oblige, and in dependance upon, the Promi&s;es o$ SUCH an Ally?</P>
