<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Volume contains a complete Collection of the
poems of the late Dr. Aken&s;ide, either reprinted
from the original Editions, or faithfully publi&s;hed from
Copies which had been prepared by him&s;elf for publication.</P>
<P>That the principal Poem &s;hould appear in &s;o di&s;advanta|geous
a &s;tate, may require &s;ome explanation. The fir&s;t pub|lication
of it was at a very early part of the Author's
life. That it wanted Revi&s;ion and Correction, he was
&s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible; but &s;o quick was the demand for &s;e|veral
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive republications, that in any of the intervals
to have completed the whole of his Corrections was utterly
impo&s;&s;ible; and yet to have gone on from time to time
making farther Improvements in every new Edition would
(he thought) have had the appearance at lea&s;t of abu&s;ing
the favor of the Public. He cho&s;e therefore to continue for
&s;ome time reprinting it without alteration, and to forbear
publi&s;hing any Corrections or Improvements until he &s;hould
be able at once to give them to the Public complete. And
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
with this view, he went on for &s;everal years to review and
correct the Poem at his lei&s;ure; till at length he found the
task grow &s;o much upon his hands, that, de&s;pairing of ever
being able to execute it &s;ufficiently to his own &s;atisfaction,
he abandoned the purpo&s;e of correcting, and re&s;olved to
write the Poem over anew upon a &s;omewhat different
and an enlarged Plan. And in the execution of this De&s;ign
he had made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s. What Rea&s;on there may
be to regret that he did not live to execute the whole of it,
will be&s;t appear from the peru&s;al of the Plan it&s;elf, as &s;tated
in the General Argument, and of the Parts which he had
executed, and which are here publi&s;hed. For the Per&s;on, to
whom he intru&s;ted the Di&s;po&s;al of his Papers, would have
thought him&s;elf wanting, as well to the Service of the Public, as
to the Fame of his Friend, if he had not produced as much
of the Work as appeared to have been prepared for publication.
In this light he con&s;idered the intire fir&s;t and &s;econd Books,
of which a few Copies had been printed for the u&s;e only of the
Author and certain Friends: al&s;o a very con&s;iderable part
of the third Book, which had been tran&s;cribed in order to
its being printed in the &s;ame manner: and to the&s;e is added
the Introduction to a &s;ub&s;equent Book, which in the Manu|&s;cript
is called the Fourth, and which appears to have been
compo&s;ed at the time when the Author intended to comprize
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
the whole in Four Books; but which, as he had afterwards
determined to di&s;tribute the Poem into more Books, might
perhaps more properly be called the La&s;t Book. And this
is all that is executed of the new work, which although it
appeared to the Editor too valuable, even in its imperfect
State, to be withholden from the Public, yet (he conceives)
takes in by much too &s;mall a part of the original Poem to
&s;upply its place, and to &s;uper&s;ede the re-publication of it.
For which rea&s;on both the Poems are in&s;erted in this col|lection.</P>
<P>Of Odes the Author had de&s;igned to make up Two Books,
con&s;i&s;ting of twenty Odes each, including the &s;everal Odes.
which he had before publi&s;hed at different times.</P>
<P>The Hymn to the Naiads is reprinted from the &s;ixth Volume
of Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellanies, with a few Corrections and the
addition of &s;ome Notes. To the In&s;criptions taken from
the &s;ame Volume three new In&s;criptions are added; the la&s;t
of which is the only in&s;tance wherein a liberty has been
taken of in&s;erting any thing in this Collection, which did not
appear to have been intended by the Author for publication;
among who&s;e papers no Copy of this was found, but it is
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
printed from a Copy which he had many years &s;ince given to.
the Editor.</P>
<P>The Author of the&s;e Poems was born at Newca&s;tle upon
Tyne, on the 9th Day of November 1721. He was edu|cated
at the Grammar School at Newca&s;tle, and at the
Univer&s;ities of Edinburgh and Leyden, at the latter of which
he took his Degree of Doctor in Phy&s;ic. He was afterwards
admitted by Mandamus to the Degree of Doctor in Phy&s;ic
in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge: elected a Fellow of the
Royal College of Phy&s;icians, and one of the Phy&s;icians
of St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital: and upon the E&s;tabli&s;hment of
the Queen's Hou&s;ehold, appointed one of the Phy&s;icians
to Her Maje&s;ty. He died of a putrid Fever, on the 23d
Day of June 1770, and is buried in the Pari&s;h Church of St.
James, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>THE
DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which &s;eem to hold
a middle place between the organs of bodily &s;en&s;e and the facul|ties
of moral perception: They have been called by a very general
name, <HI>The Powers of Imagination.</HI> Like the external &s;en&s;es, they re|late
to matter and motion; and, at the &s;ame time, give the mind ideas
analogous to tho&s;e of moral approbation and di&s;like. As they are the
inlets of &s;ome of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures with which we are ac|quainted,
it has naturally happened that men of warm and &s;en&s;ible tem|pers
have &s;ought means to recall the delightful perceptions which they
afford, independent of the objects which originally produced them.
This gave ri&s;e to the imitative or de&s;igning arts; &s;ome of which, as
painting and &s;culpture, directly copy the external appearances which
were admired in nature; others, as mu&s;ic and poetry, bring them back
to remembrance by &s;igns univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>But the&s;e arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were of
cour&s;e led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the
imaginative powers; e&s;pecially poetry, which, making u&s;e of language
as the in&s;trument by which it imitates, is con&s;equently become an un|limited
repre&s;entative of every &s;pecies and mode of being. Yet as
<PB N="4" REF="12">
their intention was only to expre&s;s the objects of imagination, and as
they &s;till abound chiefly in ideas of that cla&s;s, they of cour&s;e retain
their original character; and all the different plea&s;ures which they ex|cite,
are termed, in general, <HI>Plea&s;ures of Imagination.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The de&s;ign of the following poem is to give a view of</HI> the&s;e <HI>in the
large&s;t acceptation of the term;</HI> &s;o that whatever our imagination feels
from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertainment
we meet with either in poetry, painting, mu&s;ic, or any of the elegant arts,
might be deducible from one or other of tho&s;e principles in the con&s;titution of
the human mind, which are here e&s;tabli&s;hed and explained.</P>
<P>In executing this general plan, it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the Imagination from our other faculties; and in the next place
to characterize tho&s;e original forms or properties of being, about which
it is conver&s;ant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to
the eyes, or truth to the under&s;tanding. The&s;e properties Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>
had reduced to the three general cla&s;&s;es of greatne&s;s, novelty, and beau|ty;
and into the&s;e we may analy&s;e every object, however complex, which,
properly &s;peaking, is delightful to the imagination. But &s;uch an object
may al&s;o include many other &s;ources of plea&s;ure; and its beauty, or no|velty,
or grandeur, will make a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion by rea&s;on of this
concurrence. Be&s;ides which, the imitative arts, e&s;pecially poetry, owe
much of their effect to a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> exhibition of properties quite <HI>foreign</HI>
to the imagination, in&s;omuch that in every line of the mo&s;t applauded
poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external &s;en&s;es, or
truths di&s;covered to the under&s;tanding, or illu&s;trations of contrivance
and final cau&s;es, or, above all the re&s;t, with circum&s;tances proper to
awaken and ingage the pa&s;&s;ions. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to enume|rate
and exemplify the&s;e different &s;pecies of plea&s;ure; e&s;pecially that
<PB N="5" REF="13">
from the pa&s;&s;ions, which, as it is &s;upreme in the noble&s;t work of human
genius, &s;o being in &s;ome particulars not a little &s;urprizing, gave an op|portunity
to enliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing an
allegory to account, for the appearance.</P>
<P>After the&s;e parts of the &s;ubject which hold chiefly of admiration, or
naturally warm and intere&s;t the mind&punc; a plea&s;ure of a very different
nature, that which ari&s;es from ridicule, came next to be con&s;idered. As
this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been
but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to
give it a particular illu&s;tration, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the general &s;ources
from which the ridicule of characters is derived. Here too a change of
&s;tile became nece&s;&s;ary; &s;uch a one as might yet be con&s;i&s;tent, if po&s;&s;ible,
with the general ta&s;te of compo&s;ition in the &s;erious parts of the &s;ubject:
nor is it an ea&s;y talk to give any tolerable force to images of this kind,
without running either into the gigantic expre&s;&s;ions of the mock heroic,
or the familiar and poetical raillery of profe&s;&s;ed &s;atire; neither of which
would have been proper here.</P>
<P>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now re|mained
but to illu&s;trate &s;ome particular plea&s;ures which ari&s;e either from
the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of
imitation it&s;elf. Of the fir&s;t kind is that various and complicated re|&s;emblance
exi&s;ting between &s;everal parts of the material and immaterial
worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it &s;eems in
a great mea&s;ure to depend on the early a&s;&s;ociation of our ideas, and as
this habit of a&s;&s;ociating is the &s;ource of many plea&s;ures and pains in life,
and on that account boars a great &s;hare in the influence of poetry and
the other arts, it is therefore mentioned here and its effects de&s;cribed.
Then follows a general account of the production of the&s;e elegant arts,
<PB N="6" REF="14">
and of the &s;econdary plea&s;ure, as it is called, ari&s;ing from the re&s;em|blance
of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After
which, the work concludes with &s;ome reflexions on the general conduct
of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral u&s;efulne&s;s
in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of compo&s;ition which prevails in this
piece, little can be &s;aid with propriety by the author. He had two mo|dels;
that antient and &s;imple one of the fir&s;t <HI>Graecian</HI> poets, as it is re|fined
by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the <HI>Georgics,</HI> and the familiar epi&s;tolary way of <HI>Ho|race.</HI>
This latter has &s;everal advantages. It admits of a greater variety
of &s;tile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking
more of the air of conver&s;ation; and, e&s;pecially with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
rhyme, leads to a clo&s;er and more conci&s;e expre&s;&s;ion. Add to this the
example of the mo&s;t perfect of modern poets, who has &s;o happily ap|plied
this manner to the noble&s;t parts of philo&s;ophy, that the public
ta&s;te is in a great mea&s;ure formed to it alone. Yet, after all, the &s;ubject
before us, tending almo&s;t con&s;tantly to admiration and enthu&s;ia&s;m,
&s;eemed rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figured &s;tile. This
too appeared more natural, as the author's aim was not &s;o much to give
formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as, by
exhibiting the mo&s;t ingaging pro&s;pects of nature, to enlarge and har|monize
the imagination, and by that means in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;po&s;e the minds
of men to a &s;imilar ta&s;te and habit of thinking in religion, morals, and
civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is &s;o careful to point out the
benevolent intention of the Author of nature in every principle of the
human con&s;titution here in&s;i&s;ted on; and al&s;o to unite the moral excel|lencies
of life in the &s;ame point of view with the meer external objects
of good ta&s;te; thus recommending them in common to our natural pro|pen&s;ity
for admiring what is beautiful and lovely. The &s;ame views
<PB N="7" REF="15">
have al&s;o led him to introduce &s;ome &s;entiments which may perhaps be
looked upon as not quite direct to the &s;ubject; but, &s;ince they bear
an obvious relation to it, the authority of <HI>Virgil,</HI> the faultle&s;s model
of didactic poetry, will be&s;t &s;upport him in this particular. For the
&s;entiments them&s;elves, he makes no apology.</P>

plea&s;ures of the imagination re&s;ult from the perception of
greatne&s;s, or wonderfulne&s;s, or beauty in objects. The plea|&s;ure
from greatne&s;s, with its final cau&s;e. Plea&s;ure from

beauty, with its final cau&s;e. The connexion of beauty with
truth and good, applied to the conduct of life. Invitation to
the &s;tudy of moral philo&s;ophy. The different degrees of
beauty in different &s;pecies of objects: colour; &s;hape; na|tural

<L>A furious band that &s;purn him from the throne;</L>
<L>And all is uproar. Thus ambition gra&s;ps</L>
<L>The empire of the &s;oul: thus pale revenge</L>

Of all familiar pro&s;pects,</HI> &amp;c.] It is here &s;aid, that in con&s;equence of
the love of novelty, objects which at fir&s;t were highly delightful to the mind, lo&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="106">
that effect by repeated attention to them. But the in&s;tance of <HI>habit</HI> is oppo&s;ed to
this ob&s;ervation; for <HI>there,</HI> objects at fir&s;t di&s;ta&s;teful are in time rendered intirely
agreeable by repeated attention.</P>
<P>The difficulty in this ca&s;e will be removed, if we con&s;ider, that, when objects at
fir&s;t agreeable, lo&s;e that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly
<HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and the perception <HI>involuntary;</HI> but habit, on the other hand, generally
&s;uppo&s;es <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> accompanying it: &s;o that the plea&s;ure ari&s;es here not
from the object, but from the mind's <HI>con&s;cious</HI> determination of its own activity;
and con&s;equently increa&s;es in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will &s;till be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with di&s;agreeable objects renders
them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to <HI>re&s;olve</HI>
or <HI>act</HI> at all. In this ca&s;e, the appearance mu&s;t be accounted for, one of the&s;e
ways.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure from habit may be merely negative. The object at fir&s;t gave un|ea&s;ine&s;s:
this unea&s;ine&s;s gradually wears off as the object grows familiar: and the
mind, finding it at la&s;t intirely removed, reckons its &s;ituation really plea&s;urable, com|pared
with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The di&s;like conceived of the object at fir&s;t, might be owing to prejudice or want
of attention. Con&s;equently the mind being nece&s;&s;itated to review it often, may at
length perceive its own mi&s;take, and be reconciled to what it had looked on with
aver&s;ion. In which ca&s;e, a &s;ort of in&s;tinctive ju&s;tice naturally leads it to make
amends for the injury, by running toward the other extreme of fondne&s;s and at|tachment.</P>
<P>Or la&s;tly, though the object it&s;elf &s;hould always continue di&s;agreeable, yet cir|cum&s;tances
of plea&s;ure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an a&s;&s;oci|ation
may ari&s;e in the mind, and the object never be remembered without tho&s;e
plea&s;ing circum&s;tances attending it; by which means the di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion
which it at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned will in time be quite obliterated.</P>

even where the mind is not affected with the lea&s;t degree of <HI>wonder:</HI> whereas <HI>won|der</HI>

appearances. But the plea&s;ure in both ca&s;es is explicable from the &s;ame final cau&s;e,

a&s;&s;ert an independent and invariable law in nature, in con&s;equencce of which <HI>all ra|tional

the a&s;&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding, it follows of cour&s;e that <HI>beauty</HI> is founded
on the univer&s;al and unchangeable law of <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>But others there are, who believe <HI>beauty</HI> to be merely a relative and arbitrary
thing; that indeed it was a benevolent provi&s;ion in nature to annex &s;o delightful a
&s;en&s;ation to tho&s;e objects which are <HI>be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in them&s;elves,</HI> that &s;o we
might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without &s;taying to infer their
<HI>u&s;efulne&s;s</HI> from their &s;tructure and effects; but that it is not impo&s;&s;ible, in a phy&s;ical
&s;en&s;e, that two beings, of equal capacities for <HI>truth,</HI> &s;hould perceive, one of them
<HI>beauty,</HI> and the other <HI>deformity,</HI> in the &s;ame proportions. And upon this &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
by that <HI>truth</HI> which is always connected with <HI>beauty,</HI> nothing more can be
meant than the conformity of any object to tho&s;e proportions upon which, after

which was the rule of all &s;ucceeding arti&s;ts. Suppo&s;e a &s;tatue modelled according

<P>VER. 18.&mdash;<HI>where the powers</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of fancy,</HI> &amp;c.] The influence of the imagination on the conduct of
life, is one of the mo&s;t important points in moral philo&s;ophy. It were ea&s;y by an
induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almo&s;t all the pa&s;&s;ions, and
mixes with almo&s;t every circum&s;tance of action or plea&s;ure. Let any man, even:
of the colde&s;t head and &s;obere&s;t indu&s;try, analy&s;e the idea of what he calls his
intere&s;t; he will find that it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of certain degrees of decency,
beauty, and order, variou&s;ly combined into one &s;y&s;tem, the idol which he &s;eeks to
enjoy by labour, hazard, and &s;elf-denial. It is on this account of the la&s;t con&s;e|quence
to regulate the&s;e images by the &s;tandard of nature and the general good;
otherwi&s;e the imagination, by heightening &s;ome objects beyond their real excellence
and beauty, or by repre&s;enting others in a more odious or terrible &s;hape than they
de&s;erve, may of cour&s;e engage us in pur&s;uits utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the moral
order of things.</P>
<P>If it be objected that this account of things &s;uppo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions to be merely
accidental, whereas there appears in &s;ome a natural and hereditary di&s;po&s;ition to
certain pa&s;&s;ions prior to all circum&s;tances of education or fortune; it may be an|&s;wered,
that though no man is born <HI>ambitious</HI> or a <HI>mi&s;er,</HI> yet he may inherit from
his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which &s;hall render his imagi|nation
more liable to be &s;truck with &s;ome particular objects, con&s;equently di&s;po&s;e
him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain pa&s;&s;ions of a particular turn.
Some men, for in&s;tance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted
with the va&s;t and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle
a&s;pects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the moral
powers is always &s;imilar to this of the imagination; that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t in|clined
to admire prodigious and &s;ublime objects in the phy&s;ical world, are al&s;o mo&s;t
inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While
tho&s;e who are charmed rather with the <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>&s;weetne&s;s</HI> of colours, and forms,
and &s;ounds, never &s;ail in like manner to yield the preference to the &s;ofter &s;cenes of
<PB N="107" REF="113">
virtue and the &s;ympathies of a dome&s;tic life. And this is &s;ufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philo&s;ophers, though we have &s;everal hints concerning this
influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the <HI>Socratic</HI> &s;chool,
yet the <HI>Stoics</HI> were the fir&s;t who paid it a due attention. <HI>Zeno,</HI> their founder, thought
it impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently in&s;pecting
tho&s;e pictures or appearances of things, which the imagination offers to the mind

<P>Ver. 121. <HI>Then comes the &s;econd order,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from the &s;ame vanity,
where, though the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be real, yet no merit can ari&s;e from it, becau&s;e of &s;ome
particular circum&s;tances, which, though obvious to the &s;pectator, are yet overlooked
by the ridiculous character.</P>
<P>Ver. 152. <HI>Another tribe &s;ucceeds,</HI> &amp;c.] Ridicule from a notion of excellence in

<P>Ver. 248.&mdash;<HI>Suffice it to have &s;aid,</HI> &amp;c.] By comparing the&s;e general &s;ources
of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may
<PB N="108" REF="114">
obtain a general definition of it, equally applicable to every &s;pecies. The mo&s;t im|portant
circum&s;tance of this definition is laid down in the lines referred to; but
others more minute we &s;hall &s;ubjoin here. <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> account of the matter &s;eems
both imperfect and fal&s;e; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;ays he, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">:
<HI>the ridiculous is &s;ome certain fault or turpitude without pain, and not de&s;truc|tive
to its &s;ubject.</HI> (<HI>Po&euml;t.</HI> c. 5.) For allowing it to be true, as it is not, that the
ridiculous is never accompanied with pain, yet we might produce many in&s;tances
of &s;uch a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ri|diculous.
So that the definition does not di&s;tingui&s;h the thing de&s;igned. Nay far|ther;
even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the de&s;truction of its &s;ubject,
we may &s;till be &s;en&s;ible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent,
and the keener &s;en&s;ations of pity or terror bani&s;h the ludicrous apprehen&s;ion from
our minds. For the &s;en&s;ation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement
or di&s;agreement of ideas; but a pa&s;&s;ion or emotiom of the mind con&s;equential to
that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or di&s;agreement,
and yet not feel the ridiculous, becau&s;e it is engro&s;&s;ed by a more violent emotion.
Thus it happens that &s;ome men think tho&s;e objects ridiculous, to which others can|not
endure to apply the name; becau&s;e in them they excite a much inten&s;er and
more important feeling. And this difference, among other cau&s;es, has brought a
good deal of confu&s;ion into this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>That which makes objects ridiculous, is &s;ome ground of admiration or e&s;teen con|nected
with other more general circum&s;tances comparatively worthle&s;s or deformed; or
it is &s;ome circum&s;tance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general ex|cellent
or beautiful: the incon&s;i&s;tent properties exi&s;ting either in the objects them&s;elves,
or in the apprehen&s;ion of the per&s;on to whom they relate; belonging always to the
&s;ame order or cla&s;s of being; implying &s;entiment or de&s;ign; and exciting no acute or ve|hement
emotion of the heart.</P>
<P>To prove the &s;everal parts of this definition: <HI>The appearance of excellence or beauty
connected with a general condition comparatively &s;ordid or deformed,</HI> is ridiculous: for
in&s;tance, pompous preten&s;ions of wi&s;dom joined with ignorance or folly in the <HI>So|crates</HI>
of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes;</HI> and the o&s;tentations of military glory with cowardice and
&s;tupidity in the <HI>Thra&s;o</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general
excellent or venerable,</HI> is al&s;o ridiculous: for in&s;tance, the per&s;onal weakne&s;&s;es of a
magi&s;trate appearing in the &s;olemn and public functions of his &s;tation.</P>
<P><HI>The incongruous properties may either exi&s;t in the objects them&s;elves, or in apprehen|&s;ion
of the per&s;on to whom they relate:</HI> in the la&s;t-mentioned in&s;tance, they both exi&s;t
in the objects; in the in&s;tances from <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> one of them is
objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehen&s;ion of the ridiculous
character.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">
<HI>The incon&s;i&s;tent properties mu&s;t belong to the &s;ame order or cla&s;s of being.</HI> A cox|comb
in fine cloaths, bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object;
becau&s;e his general apprehen&s;ion of excellence and e&s;teem is referred to the &s;plen|dour
and expence of his dre&s;s. A man of &s;en&s;e and merit, in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances,
is not counted ridiculous; becau&s;e the general ground of excellence and
e&s;teem in him is, both in fact and in his own apprehen&s;ion, of a very different
&s;pecies.</P>
<P><HI>Every ridiculous object implies &s;entiment or de&s;ign.</HI> A column placed by an architect
without a capital or ba&s;e, is laughed at: the &s;ame column in a ruin cau&s;es a very
different &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, <HI>the occurrence mu&s;t excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart,</HI>
&s;uch as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that ca&s;e, as was ob&s;erved above, the
mind is not at lei&s;ure to contemplate the ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this de&s;cription, and whe|ther
it comprehend every &s;pecies and form of the ridiculous, mu&s;t be determined by
repeated applications of it to particular in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Ver. 259. <HI>A&s;k we for what fair end,</HI> &amp;c.] Since it is beyond all contradiction evident
that we have a <HI>natural</HI> &s;en&s;e or feeling of the ridiculous, and &s;ince &s;o good a rea&s;on
may be a&s;&s;igned to ju&s;tify the &s;upreme being for be&s;towing it; one cannot without a&s;to|ni&s;hment
reflect on the conduct of tho&s;e men who imagine it is for the &s;ervice of
true religion to vilify and blacken it without di&s;tinction, and endeavour to per&s;uade
us that it is never applied but in a bad cau&s;e. Ridicule is not concerned with mere
&s;peculative truth or fal&s;ehood. It is not in ab&s;tract propo&s;itions or theorems, but in
actions and pa&s;&s;ions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find materials
for it; and all the&s;e terms are <HI>relative,</HI> implying approbation or blame. To a&s;k
them whether <HI>ridicule be a te&s;t of truth,</HI> is, in other words, to a&s;k whether that
which is ridiculous can be <HI>morally true,</HI> can be ju&s;t and becoming; or whether
that which is ju&s;t and becoming, can be ridiculous. A que&s;tion that does not de|&s;erve
a &s;erious an&s;wer. For it is mo&s;t evident, that, as in a metaphy&s;ical propo&s;ition
offered to the under&s;tanding for its a&s;&s;ent, the faculty of rea&s;on examines the terms
of the propo&s;ition, and finding one idea, which was &s;uppo&s;ed equal to another, to
be in fact unequal, of con&s;equence rejects the propo&s;ition as a fal&s;ehood; &s;o, in
objects offered to the mind for its e&s;teem or applau&s;e, the faculty of ridicule, finding
an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt.
When therefore we ob&s;erve &s;uch a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the incon|&s;i&s;tent
circum&s;tances carefully concealed from the eye of the public, it is our bu|&s;ine&s;s,
if the matter be of importance to &s;ociety, to drag out tho&s;e latent circum|&s;tances,
and, by &s;etting them in full view, to convince the world how ridiculous the
claim is: and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the <HI>moral
fal&s;ehood</HI> &s;ooner than in the way of &s;peculative inquiry, and impre&s;s the minds of
<PB N="110" REF="116">
men with a &s;tronger &s;en&s;e of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no
more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, the practice is dangerous, and may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the regard
we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I an&s;wer, the practice fairly ma|naged
can never be dangerous; men may be di&s;hone&s;t in obtruding circum&s;tances
foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing tho&s;e circum&s;tances to
impo&s;e upon us: but the &s;en&s;e of ridicule always judges right. The <HI>Socrates</HI> of
<HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> is as <HI>truly</HI> ridiculous a character as ever was drawn:&mdash;True; but it is
not the character of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the divine morali&s;t and father of ancient wi&s;dom.
What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philo&s;opher from detecting and
di&s;claiming tho&s;e foreign circum&s;tances which he had fal&s;ely introduced into his
character, and thus rendered the &s;atiri&s;t doubly ridiculous in his turn? No; but it
neverthele&s;s had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And &s;o has the rea|&s;oning
of <HI>Spinoza</HI> made many athei&s;ts: he has founded it indeed on &s;uppo&s;itions
utterly fal&s;e; but allow him the&s;e, and his conclu&s;ions are unavoidably true. And if
we mu&s;t reject the u&s;e of ridicule, becau&s;e, by the impo&s;ition of fal&s;e circum&s;tances,
things may be made to &s;eem ridiculous, which are not &s;o in them&s;elves; why we
ought not in the &s;ame manner to reject the u&s;e of rea&s;on, becau&s;e, by proceeding on
fal&s;e principles, conclu&s;ions will appear true which are impo&s;&s;ible in nature, let the

<HEAD>THE GENERAL ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q><P>The plea&s;ures of the imagination proceed either from natural
objects, as from a flouri&s;hing grove, a clear and murmuring
fountain, a calm &s;ea by moon-light; or from works of art,
&s;uch as a noble edifice, a mu&s;ical tune, a &s;tatue, a picture, a
poem. In treating of the&s;e plea&s;ures, we mu&s;t begin with
the former cla&s;s; they being original to the other; and no|thing
more being nece&s;&s;ary, in order to explain them, than a
view of our natural inclination toward greatne&s;s and beauty,
and of tho&s;e appearances, in the world around us, to which
that inclination is adapted. This is the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t
book of the following poem.</P>
<P>But the plea&s;ures which we receive from the elegant arts, from
mu&s;ic, &s;culpture, painting, and poetry, are much more va|rious
and complicated. In them (be&s;ides greatne&s;s and beau|ty,
or forms proper to the imagination) we find interwoven
frequent repre&s;entations of truth, of virtue and vice, of
circum&s;tances proper to move us with laughter, or to excite in
us pity, fear, and the other pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e moral and in|tellectual
objects are de&s;cribed in the &s;econd book; to which
the third properly belongs as an epi&s;ode, though too large to
have been included in it.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="120">
With the above-mentioned cau&s;es of plea&s;ure, which are univer|&s;al
in the cour&s;e of human life and appertain to our higher
faculties, many others do generally concur, more limited in
their operation, or of an inferior origin: &s;uch are the novelty
of objects, the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, affections of the bodily
&s;en&s;es, influences of education, national habits, and the like.
To illu&s;trate the&s;e, and from the whole to determine the cha|racter
of a perfect ta&s;te, is the argument of the fourth book.</P>
<P>Hitherto the plea&s;ures of the imagination belong to the human &s;pe|cies
in general. But there are certain particular men who&s;e
imagination is indowed with powers, and &s;u&s;ceptible of plea|&s;ures,
which the generality of mankind never participate.
the&s;e are the men of genius, de&s;tined by nature to excell in
one or other of the arts already mentioned. It is propo&s;ed
therefore, in the la&s;t place, to delineate that genius which in
&s;ome degree appears common to them all; yet with a more
peculiar con&s;ideration of poetry: ina&s;much as poetry is the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive of tho&s;e arts, the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical, and the
mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P></Q>

and its three cla&s;&s;es, matter of fact, experimental or &s;cientifical
truth, (contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from opinion) and univer&s;al truth:
which la&s;t is either metaphy&s;ical or geometrical, either purely in|tellectual
or perfectly ab&s;tracted. On the power of di&s;cerning
truth depends that of acting with the view of an end; a cir|cum&s;tance
e&s;&s;ential to virtue. Of virtue, con&s;idered in the
divine mind as a perpetual and univer&s;al beneficence. Of
human virtue, con&s;idered as a &s;y&s;tem of particular &s;entiments
and actions, &s;uitable to the de&s;ign of providence and the con|dition
of man; to whom it con&s;titutes the chief good and the
fir&s;t beauty. Of vice and its origin. Of ridicule: its ge|neral
nature and final cau&s;e. Of the pa&s;&s;ions; particularly
of tho&s;e which relate to evil natural or moral, and which are
generally accounted painful, though not always unattended
with plea&s;ure.</Q>

<P><PB N="344" REF="345">
Stanza II. 3.] <HI>Pindar</HI> was cotemporary with <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> and <HI>Cimon,</HI> in whom the
glory of ancient <HI>Greece</HI> was at its height. When <HI>Xerxes</HI> invaded <HI>Greece, Pindar</HI>
was true to the common intere&s;t of his country; though his fellow citizens, the
<HI>Thebans,</HI> had &s;old them&s;elves to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> king. In one of his odes he expre&s;&s;es
the great di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety of his mind, occa&s;ioned by the va&s;t preparations of
<HI>Xerxes</HI> again&s;t <HI>Greece. (I&s;thm.</HI> 8.) In another he celebrates the victories of <HI>Salamis,
Platoea,</HI> and <HI>Himera. (Pyth.</HI> I.) It will be nece&s;&s;ary to add two or three other par|ticulars
of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text
concerning him. Fir&s;t then, he was thought to be &s;o great a favourite of <HI>Apollo,</HI>
that the prie&s;ts of that deity allotted him a con&s;tant &s;hare of their offerings. It was
&s;aid of him, as of &s;ome other illu&s;trious men, that at his birth a &s;warm of bees
lighted on his lips, and fed him with their honey. It was al&s;o a tradition concerning
him, that <HI>Pan</HI> was heard to recite his poetry, and &s;een dancing to one of his hymns
on the mountains near <HI>Thebes.</HI> But a real hi&s;torical fact in his life is, that the
<HI>Thebans</HI> impo&s;ed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in his poems for that heroic &s;pirit, &s;hewn by the people of <HI>Athens</HI> in defence
of the common liberty, which his own fellow citizens had &s;hamefully betrayed.
And, as the argument of this ode implies, that <HI>great poetical talents, and high &s;en|timents
of liberty, do reciprocally produce and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other,</HI> &s;o <HI>Pindar</HI> is perhaps
the mo&s;t exemplary proof of this connection, which occurs in hi&s;tory. The <HI>Thebans</HI>
were remarkable, in general, for a &s;lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition through all the fortunes of
their common-wealth; at the time of its ruin by <HI>Philip;</HI> and even in its be&s;t &s;tate,
under the admini&s;tration of <HI>Pelopidas</HI> and <HI>Epaminondas:</HI> and every one knows, they
were no le&s;s remarkable for great dullne&s;s, and want of all genius. That <HI>Pindar</HI>
&s;hould have equally di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf from the re&s;t of his fellow citizens in both
the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;eems &s;omewhat extraordinary, and is &s;carce to be accounted for but
by the preceding ob&s;ervation.</P>

with great zeal cultivate their friend&s;hip; having been introduced, for&s;ooth, at the
meetings of that re&s;pectable confederacy: a favour which he afterwards &s;poke of
in very high terms of complacency and thankfulne&s;s. At the &s;ame time in his inter|cour&s;e
with them he treated Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in a mo&s;t contemptuous manner, and as a
writer without genius. Of the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions his Lord&s;hip can have no
doubt, if he recollects his own corre&s;pondence with <HI>Concanen;</HI> a part of which is

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The Nymphs, who pre&s;ide over &s;prings and rivulets, are ad|dre&s;&s;ed
at day-break, in honor of their &s;everal functions,
and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to
the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the fir&s;t al|legorical
deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine
of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of
the gods and the ri&s;e of things. They are then &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
con&s;idered, as giving motion to the air and exciting &s;ummer-breezes;
as nouri&s;hing and beautifying the vegetable creation;
as contributing to the fullne&s;s of navigable rivers; and con|&s;equently
to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means,
to the maritime part of military power. Next is repre&s;ented
their favourable influence upon health, when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by rural
exerci&s;e: which introduces their connection with the art of
phy&s;ic, and the happy effects of mineral medicinal &s;prings.
La&s;tly, they are celebrated for the friend&s;hip which the Mu&s;es
bear them, and for the true in&s;piration which temperance
only can receive: in oppo&s;ition to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the more
licentious poets.</Q>

<HEAD>NOTES
ON THE
HYMN TO THE NAIADS.</HEAD>
<P>Page 350. l. 11.&mdash;<HI>Love</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Elder than Chaos.] He&s;iod,</HI> in his <HI>Theogony,</HI> gives a different account,
and makes Chaos the elde&s;t of beings; though he a&s;&s;igns to Love neither fa|ther
nor &s;uperior; which circum&s;tance is particularly mentioned by <HI>Phoedrus,</HI> in
<HI>Plato's Banquet,</HI> as being ob&s;ervable not only in <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> but in all other writers
both of ver&s;e and pro&s;e: and on the &s;ame occa&s;ion he cites a line from <HI>Parmenides,</HI>
in which Love is expre&s;sly &s;tiled the elde&s;t of all the gods. Yet <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> in
<HI>The Birds,</HI> affirms, that &startq;Chaos, and Night, and Erebus, and Tartarus, were
fir&s;t; and that Love was produced from an egg, which the &s;able-winged night de|po&s;ited
in the immen&s;e bo&s;om of Erebus.&endq; But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the
Love de&s;igned by this comic poet was always di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other, from that
original and &s;elf-exi&s;tent being the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of <HI>Plato,</HI> and meant only
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or &s;econd per&s;on of the old <HI>Groecian</HI> trinity; to whom is in&s;cribed
an hymn among tho&s;e which pa&s;s under the name of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> where he is called
<HI>Protogonos;</HI> or the fir&s;t-begotten, is &s;aid to have been born of an egg, and is repre|&s;ented
as the principal or origin of all the&s;e external appearances of nature. In the
fragments of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> collected by <HI>Henry Stephens,</HI> he is named <HI>Phanes,</HI> the di&s;co|verer
or di&s;clo&s;er; who unfolded the ideas of the-&s;upreme intelligence, and ex|po&s;ed
them to the perception of inferior beings in this vi&s;ible frame of the world;
as <HI>Macrobius,</HI> and <HI>Proclus,</HI> and <HI>Athenagoras</HI> all agree to interpret the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages
of <HI>Orpheus</HI> which they have pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But the Love de&s;igned in our text, is the one &s;elf-exi&s;tent and in&s;inite mind, whom
if the generality of ancient mythologi&s;ts have not introduced or truly de&s;cribed in
accounting for the production of the world and its appearances; yet, to a modern
poet, it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this par|ticular;
though, in other re&s;pects, he profe&s;&s;eth to imitate their manner and con|form
to their opinions. For, in the&s;e great points of natural theology, they differ
no le&s;s remarkably among them&s;elves; and are perpetually confounding the philo|&s;ophical
relations of things with the traditionary circum&s;tances of mythic hi&s;tory:
<PB N="364" REF="364">
upon which very account, <HI>Callimachus,</HI> in his hymn to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> declareth his di&s;&s;ent
from them concerning even an article of the national creed; adding, that the an|cient
bards were by no means to be depended on. And yet in the exordium of
the old <HI>Argonautic</HI> poem, a&s;cribed to <HI>Orpheus,</HI> it is &s;aid, that &startq;Love, whom mortals
in later times call <HI>Phanes,</HI> was the father of the eternally-begotten Night;&endq; who
is generally repre&s;ented by the&s;e mythological poets, as being her&s;elf the parent of
all things; and who, in the <HI>Indigitamenta,</HI> or <HI>Orphic Hymns,</HI> is &s;aid to be the &s;ame
with <HI>Cypris,</HI> or Love it&s;elf. Moreover, in the body of this <HI>Argonautic</HI> poem, where
the per&s;onated <HI>Orpheus</HI> introduceth him&s;elf &s;inging to his lyre in reply to <HI>Chiron,</HI> he
celebrateth &startq;the ob&s;cure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained
within it&s;elf in a &s;tate of perpetual vici&s;&s;itude; how the heaven had its boundary
determined; the generation of the earth; the depth of the ocean; and al&s;o the
&s;apient Love, the mo&s;t ancient, the &s;elf-&s;ufficient; with all the beings which he
produced when he &s;eparated one thing from another.&endq; Which noble pa&s;|&s;age
is more directly to <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> purpo&s;e in the fir&s;t book of his metaphy&s;ics
than any of tho&s;e which he has there quoted, to &s;hew that the ancient poets
and mythologi&s;ts agreed with <HI>Empedocles, Anaxagoras,</HI> and the other more &s;ober
philo&s;ophers, in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind con|cerning
the nece&s;&s;ity of mind and rea&s;on to account for the connexion, motion, and
good order of the world. For, though neither this poem, nor the hymns which
pa&s;s under the &s;ame name, are it &s;hould &s;eem, the work of the real <HI>Orpheus;</HI> yet
beyond all que&s;tion, they are very ancient. The hymns, more particularly, are: al|lowed
to be older than the inva&s;ion of <HI>Greece</HI> by <HI>Xerxes;</HI> and were probably a &s;ett
of public and &s;olemn forms of devotion: as appears by a pa&s;&s;age in one of them,
which <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> hath almo&s;t literally cited in his fir&s;t oration again&s;t <HI>Ari&s;togiton,</HI>
as the &s;aying of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> the founder of their mo&s;t holy my&s;teries. On this ac|count,
they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant,
the <HI>Theogony</HI> of <HI>He&s;iod</HI> him&s;elf not excepted. The poetry of them is often ex|tremely
noble; and the my&s;terious air which prevails in them, together with its
delightful impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind, cannot be better expre&s;&s;ed than in that re|markable
de&s;cription with which they in&s;pired the <HI>German</HI> editor <HI>E&s;chenbach,</HI> when
he accidentally met with them at <HI>Leip&s;ic:</HI> &startq;The&s;aurum me reperi&s;&s;e credidi, &s;ays he,

of the poets, they repre&s;ented that part of the general &s;y&s;tem of natural
cau&s;es which relates to man, and to other mortal beings: for &s;o we are told in the
hymn addre&s;&s;ed to them among the <HI>Orphic Indigitamenta,</HI> where they are called the
daughters of Night (or Love), and, contrary to the vulgar notion, are di&s;tingui&s;hed

On this account he was induced to attempt &s;omewhat in the &s;ame manner; &s;olely by
way of exerci&s;e: the manner it&s;elf being now almo&s;t intirely abandoned in poetry.
And as the meer genealogy, or the per&s;onal adventures of heathen gods, could
have been but little intere&s;ting to a modern reader; it was therefore thought proper
to &s;elect &s;ome convenient part of the hi&s;tory of nature, and to employ the&s;e ancient
divinities as it probable they were fir&s;t employed; to wit, in per&s;onifying natural
cau&s;es, and in repre&s;enting the mutual agreement or oppo&s;ition of the corporeal and
moral powers of the world: which hath been accounted the very highe&s;t office of
