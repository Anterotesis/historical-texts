<P>IN <HI>"A Letter to George Steevens, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by James Boaden, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>"</HI> ju&s;t publi&s;hed, is the following acknowledgement; which &s;o exactly de&s;cribes my own feelings in the &s;ame &s;ituation, that I take the liberty to adopt the very words.</P>
<P>"When a report fir&s;t went abroad, that Mr. Ireland, of Norfolk-&s;treet, had made a di&s;covery &s;o important as the papers of Shak&s;peare, the writer of the&s;e &s;heets went to &s;ee them, and was very politely allowed by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to hear him read them at lei&s;ure. In &s;ome in&s;tances cre|dulity is no di&s;grace:&mdash;&s;trong enthu&s;ia&s;m is always eager to believe. I confe&s;s, therefore, that, for &s;ome time after I had &s;een them, I continued to believe them genuine. They bore the character of the poet's writing&mdash;the paper appeared of &s;uf|ficient age&mdash;the water-marks were earne&s;tly di&s;|played, and the matter diligently applauded.&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="4">To a mind filled with the mo&s;t ardent love and the mo&s;t eager zeal, di&s;armed of caution by the character too of the gentleman who di&s;played them, it will not be a &s;ubject of &s;evere reproof, that the wi&s;hed impre&s;&s;ion was made.</P>
<P>I remember that I beheld the papers with the tremor of the pure&s;t delight&mdash;touched the inva|luable relics with reverential re&s;pect, and deemed even exi&s;tence dearer, as it gave me &s;o refined a &s;atisfaction. He, who has long combatted with the arts of literary impo&s;ture, may &s;mile at the &s;implicity of this avowal, although he &s;hould be unable to refu&s;e his prai&s;e to the candour by which it has been dictated."</P>
<P>Such were preci&s;ely <HI>my</HI> feelings when Mr. Ireland did me the favour to &s;hew me the papers, &amp;c. adverted to; and I &s;incerely hope, that nothing I may have occa&s;ion to &s;ay concerning them, will be con&s;trued into di&s;re&s;pect for him: their authen|ticity is now on trial at the bar of the publick, and every one is free to give evidence; as mine will be &s;aithfully delivered, I tru&s;t it will be favourably received.</P>
<P>Un&s;killed as I am, the only doubt that &s;truck me, on hearing the papers read, was of the word <HI>whym&s;ycalle;</HI> which, I then ob&s;erved, I did not
<PB N="7" REF="5">remember to have met with at &s;o early a period: this objection was &s;oon overruled by the &s;uppo|&s;ition that, as the word mu&s;t have been produced at &s;ome period, Shak&s;peare might then have coined it. I acquie&s;ced, departed highly gratified, and in all other re&s;pects entirely &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>In a conver&s;ation &s;ome time after, on the &s;ub|ject of the&s;e papers, with a gentleman of the &s;ounde&s;t judgment, and be&s;t information, I hinted the doubt. I had entertained of the word <HI>whym&s;y|calle;</HI> he pronounced it too modern for Shak&s;|peare: which, recollecting the adage <HI>ex pede Her|culem,</HI> cau&s;ed me to look a little farther into the matter.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the ob&s;ervations I made, many of which, Mr. Boaden having anticipated me in them, are omitted, I am proud to &s;ay, have been approved of by the gentleman alluded to. I &s;ub|mit the following, therefore, with a re&s;pectful confidence, to the &s;kilful in Shak&s;pearean lore; &s;timulated by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to contribute my faint breath towards the di&s;pelling the&s;e newly|ari&s;en vapours: which, if &s;uffered to conden&s;e, might dim the effulgence of Shak&s;peare!</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>In page 1, following the preface to, <HI>"Mi&s;cel|laneous Papers,"</HI> &amp;c. is &s;aid, "for <HI>I,</HI> read <HI>Aye: this was the Author's u&s;ual mode of writing.</HI>"&mdash; Mr. Ireland might have added, <HI>and of every other Author at that period.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;uper&s;cription of queen Elizabeth's letter to Shak&s;peare, written with her own hand, is as carefully worded, as if it were to have been &s;ent by the penny-po&s;t; had the office &s;o named been then e&s;tabli&s;hed. So far from directing a letter, Elizabeth wrote not the inward contents; that haughty per&s;onage was not in the habit of &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion: her &s;ignature only, or, on rare occa&s;ions, an additional line, compri&s;ed nearly the whole of her hand-writing, in any letter from her. In the letter the queen &s;tyles him "<HI>Ma&s;|terre</HI> William;" the orthography of that age was <HI>Mai&s;ter,</HI> from the old French <HI>Mai&s;tre,</HI> now written <HI>Maitre;</HI> the French having ejected the <HI>s</HI> from many words in which we, though they are derived from them, retain it. This Chattertoni&s;m occurs frequently in the&s;e wonderful, or rather blunder|ful, papers.</P>
<P>"50 <HI>Poundes</HI>" was a great &s;um, at that period, to receive for playing <HI>"before the Lorde Leyce&s;|terre;"</HI> although the <HI>"Expenneces thereuponne"</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="7">amounted to "19 <HI>poundes:</HI>" and, per contra, "2 <HI>&s;hyllynges moure</HI>" to <HI>"Ma&s;terre Lowinne;"</HI> whom, in the <HI>"Deed of Tru&s;t to John Hemynge,"</HI> Shak&s;peare terms <HI>"oure be&s;t Actorr;"</HI> was but a &s;mall compliment
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I remark here, en pa&s;&s;ant, that <HI>compliment,</HI> in Shak&s;peare's time, was u&s;ed as a noun only; in queen Elizabeth's letter to him it appears as a verb.</NOTE> <HI>"forre bys Goode Servyces and welle playinge."</HI> Even the &s;pelling of this cele|brated actor's name is dubious: in the li&s;t of performers affixed to <HI>Sejanus, The Foxe, The Alchemi&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Catiline,</HI> (Ben Jon&s;on's Works, folio, 1616) his name is uniformly &s;pelt <HI>Lowin:</HI> and, &s;urely, the per&s;on who entered into a legal contract with him, as Shak&s;peare is, in the&s;e papers, repre&s;ented to have done, mu&s;t have known the cu&s;tomary orthography of his name.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that the well-known urbanity of Shak&s;peare's mind, and &s;uavity of his manners, could not have permitted him to affront the great Burbage, and other fir&s;t-rate performers, by unnece&s;&s;arily &s;tyling Lowin, however excel|lent, in a legal in&s;trument of public notoriety, "oure <HI>be&s;t</HI> Actorr."</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>"Letter to <HI>Anna Hatherrewaye.</HI>"</P>
<P>This female's names were <HI>Anne Hathaway. Anna</HI> is a Latin adoption of, comparatively, mo|dern u&s;e; the orthography of <HI>Hatherrewaye</HI> is merely Chattertonian.</P>
<P>In the letter to her, a kingly crown is termed a "gyldedde <HI>bawble.</HI>" <HI>Bawble</HI> formerly meant the carved truncheon, with a fool's head at the top of it, u&s;ed by court and &s;tage buffoons; there|fore a very unlikely epithet to be applied by Shak&s;peare to the &s;ymbol of maje&s;ty; to which he every where pays great re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the <HI>"Letter to the Earl of Southampton,"</HI> we read <HI>"itte is a Budde which Bllo&s;&s;ommes Blloomes"</HI> &amp;c. Shak&s;peare was too good a naturali&s;t not to know, that a <HI>Bud</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Blooms,</HI> then <HI>Blo&s;&s;oms.</HI></P>
<P>"tooe <HI>&s;ublyme</HI> a feeling," in the &s;ame letter, is a very que&s;tionable expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;crawl of this &s;ublime and blooming letter is what &s;chool-boys call pot-hooks and hangers; and utterly unlike the hand-writing of that or any other age: and, if the &s;ignature be the autograph of <HI>any</HI> earl of Southampton, it is, I am informed, not that of Shak&s;peare's benefactor.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<P>In the <HI>"Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith," "acceeded toe"</HI> is a phra&s;e an hundred years too modern for Shak|&s;peare.</P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of the <HI>"Profe&s;&s;ion"</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Chickenne</HI> is u&s;ed for the <HI>Hen,</HI> who receives her brood under her wings; on the propriety of which con&s;ult the holy &s;criptures. <HI>Chickenne</HI> is al&s;o ob|jectionable in this place as ungrammatical, it being u&s;ed in the &s;ingular number; whereas, the old &s;ingular was <HI>Chick,</HI> and <HI>Chicken</HI> the plural. So <HI>Ox,</HI> and <HI>Oxen; Cow,</HI> and <HI>Cowen;</HI> contracted into <HI>Kine.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>"Letter to Richard Cowley"</HI> we read, "a <HI>whym&s;ycalle</HI> conceyt;"&mdash;the word <HI>whym&s;ycalle,</HI> or <HI>whim&s;ical,</HI> as I have already &s;aid, does not, I am a&s;&s;ured, occur in or near that period. I have a little book, printed in 1631, entituled "<HI>Whim|zies:</HI> or a New Ca&s;t of Characters;"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract from the character of <HI>"A Ruffian,"</HI> in this &s;carce book, as it relates to our ancient theatres, may not be unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>"To a play they wil hazard to go, though with never a rag of money: where after the <HI>&s;econd Act,</HI> when the <HI>Doore</HI> is weakly guarded, they will make <HI>forcible entrie;</HI> a knock with a Cudgell is the wor&s;t; whereat though they grumble, they re&s;t pacified upon their admittance. Forthwith, by violent a&s;&s;ault and a&s;&s;ent, they a&s;pire to the two-pennie roome; where being furni&s;hed with Tinder, Match, and a portion of decayed <HI>Barmoodas,</HI> they &s;moake it mo&s;t terribly, applaud a prophane jea&s;t unmea&s;urably, and in the end grow di&s;ta&s;tefully rude to all the Companie. At the Conclu&s;ion of all, they &s;ingle out their <HI>dainty Doxes,</HI> to cloze up a fruitle&s;&s;e day with a &s;inneful evening."</P></NOTE> which,
<PB N="12" REF="10">though <HI>Whim</HI> mu&s;t apparently have preceded, is the earlie&s;t in&s;tance I can recollect of any word like <HI>whym&s;ycalle.</HI></P>
<P>One might imagine, from the careful &s;uper|&s;cription of the letter to Cowley, that queen Eli|zabeth had conde&s;cended to direct that too.</P>
<P>The figure <HI>"evidently meant for Shylock"</HI> is repre&s;ented with a blue cap on. Jews in Venice are obliged to wear a red cap or hat, as a badge of their per&s;ua&s;ion. Shak&s;peare, however, or the painter of this grote&s;que figure, might not be acquainted with the co&s;tume of that place and people.</P>
<P>In the <HI>"Deed of Gift to Ireland,"</HI> after the word <HI>"followithe"</HI> are three conjunctive notes of admiration!!! I believe two notes of admiration in conjunction have not been u&s;ed till very lately. When the plays of <HI>"Kyng henrye thyrde of Eng|lande,"</HI> "<HI>Kyage Hy</HI> vii," &amp;c. come to light, we
<PB N="13" REF="11">mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed at finding in them the words <HI>&s;windler, &s;hawl,</HI> and <HI>Otabeite;</HI> or the **** of <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy.</HI></P>
<P>As Shak&s;peare's <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI> and <HI>Macbeth,</HI> which were given to Cowley, were never printed till the folio, 1623, was put forth by Heminge and Condell; how chanced it that Heminge did not, having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>"Oakenn Che&s;te,"</HI> with all the Plays therein, and being, we may imagine, on good terms with the party, prevail on "Ma&s;terr Burbage," as he had done with Cowley, to per|mit him to publi&s;h <HI>"y^e Virginn Quene"</HI> in &s;aid folio?</P>
<P>For what rea&s;on did Heminge exclude from the folio Shak&s;peare's <HI>"newe Playe neverr yette imprynted called Kynge Hy VII,"</HI> which was <HI>"toe bee whollye for &s;^d J. Hemynge?"</HI> And why did not Heminge publi&s;h in that folio the <HI>"Playe called Kynge Vorrtygerne,"</HI> and appropriate what the copy-right of it might then be deemed worth, to the u&s;e and advantage of <HI>"thatt Ghylde"</HI> to whom it was a&s;&s;igned?</P>
<P>The play of <HI>"Kynge henrye thyrde of Englande"</HI> having, with <HI>"Henry fowrthe," "Henrye fyfthe," "Kyng John,"</HI> and <HI>"Kyng Leare,"</HI> been given by Shak&s;peare to "<HI>Ma&s;terre William Henrye Ire|lande;</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="12">we may hope that Ma&s;terre Samuel Ireland, or Ma&s;terre Samuel-William-Henry Ireland, to whom we are obliged for the immaculate <HI>"Kynge Leare,"</HI> will &s;peedily favour the publick with it: a play which Shak&s;peare's "good and Worthye Freynd John Hemynge," to who&s;e "honorr" he tru&s;ted, withheld, not only from a poor child, but from even him&s;elf, being already produced; the other hitherto - unheard - of play, coming within the family-compact, <HI>"&s;ame name and arms,"</HI> &amp;c. is &s;urely a le&s;s difficult attainment: and I con|clude that the <HI>"more intere&s;ting hi&s;torical Play,"</HI> announced in Mr. Ireland's preface, is the play of <HI>"Kyng henrye thyrde of Englande."</HI></P>
<P>Should any fortunate circum&s;tance re&s;tore to us <HI>"Kynge H^y vii,"</HI> and who knows what indu&s;try and ingenuity may effect? we &s;hall probably po&s;|&s;e&s;s all the Dramas of Shak&s;peare, hitherto men|tioned; as the writer of the&s;e Reflections, or what|ever they may be termed, is particularly acquainted with, and has great influence over, a now-living <HI>"Ma&s;terr Burbage,"</HI> lineally de&s;cended, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, from Shak&s;peare's <HI>Burbage;</HI> through who&s;e, or &s;ome other means, he doubts not he &s;hall be enabled to recover an entire copy of <HI>"y^e Virginn Quene:"</HI> from which he has already obtained a few extracts, &s;ubjoined to the&s;e remarks.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>They are, for the reader's ea&s;e, though not perhaps the antiquary's gratification, dive&s;ted of the ru&s;t of age; the redundant &s;pelling: but, let not a &s;eeming lack of years be any impediment to a reverend e&s;timation.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Tragedye of Kynge Leare,"</HI> our P&s;eudo-Shak&s;peare &s;ays, <HI>"I&s;se fromme Ma&s;terre Hol|linne&s;hedde."</HI></P>
<P>I have not a volume of that hi&s;torian at pre&s;ent in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but, to the be&s;t of my recollec|tion, the orthography of his name in the title-page to his works is much more &s;imple.</P>
<P>The "Libbertye" he has taken, Shak&s;peare adds, in having "&s;omme lyttle deparretedde fromme hymme," "wille notte," he tru&s;ts "be blamedde bye" his <HI>"gentle Readerres."</HI></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of Shak&s;peare's ap|pealing to <HI>Readers;</HI> in writing his Dramas it is well known that he thought only of <HI>Audi|tors</HI> and <HI>Spectators:</HI> &mdash; but, as it nece&s;&s;arily in|cludes an implication that he had prepared this copy of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> for the pre&s;s him&s;elf, we might naturally expect the text to be correct; at lea&s;t intelligible; &s;o far from which, it is, mau|gre Mr. Ireland's preface, the mo&s;t incorrect,
<PB N="16" REF="14">unintelligible text I ever &s;aw, in any copy of any play whatever: and, in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing, as &s;ome may, Mr. Ireland, his &s;on, or any other intelligent per&s;on, the fabricator; I &s;hould rather imagine it to be really, and bona fide, an ancient copy; taken &s;urreptitiou&s;ly and erroneou&s;ly, from the mouths of the actors, by &s;ome Printer's illiterate devil: to which had, for private purpo&s;es, been added an imitation of Shak&s;peare's &s;ignature, and ad|dre&s;s to his <HI>"gentle Readerres."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Ireland &s;ays "that in the paper on which this play <HI>["Kynge Leare"]</HI> is written, more than twenty different water-marks appear."</P>
<P>If this be meant as evidence of the MS. of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> being the genuine production, and hand-writing of Shak&s;peare; I doubt it will prove a weight in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale: when the opulent Shak&s;peare, as he undoubtedly was when his <HI>King Lear</HI> was produced, &s;at down to write a play, &s;urely he was furni&s;hed with a quire or two of paper for the purpo&s;e; the &s;heets of which would, of cour&s;e, all bear the &s;ame water-mark: whereas, admitting the copy in que&s;tion to be an ancient, but &s;tolen, one; a needy hireling, who could not afford better, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have written on ca&s;ually - collected and va|riou&s;ly - marked paper: and a modern fabri|cator,
<PB N="17" REF="15">for argument' &s;ake here imagined, would be compelled to collect old paper piece-meal; in all probability, containing "more than twenty different water-marks."</P>
<P>In <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> p. 4. we read, "Ande the whore&s;onne mu&s;t be acknowleggede."</P>
<P>Shake&s;peare, if we may credit <HI>"The Deed of Tru&s;t to John Heyminge,"</HI> could, like his own Portia, better teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow his own teaching; otherwi&s;e he might have recollected this pa&s;&s;age in regard to <HI>"thatte Chylde of whom wee have &s;pokenn butt who mu&s;t not be named here;"</HI> and who, if &s;uch <HI>"Chylde"</HI> ever exi&s;ted, &s;eems to have been one who&s;e &s;ervices &s;tood bound to <HI>Godde&s;&s;e Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The affectedly-antique &s;pelling in <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> is, throughout, &s;o unprecedentedly re|dundant, as, of it&s;elf, to be a convincing proof of inartificial imitation; but the &s;pelling of the Latin verb in the quotation, p. 4. <HI>"Glo&s;terre Exilte,"</HI> with the old Engli&s;h termination, the double <HI>t,</HI> and <HI>e</HI> final, is &s;o very ridiculous, that, could it be proved to have been by Shak&s;peare, we might hereafter &s;ay, that he had &s;mall Engli&s;h and le&s;s Latin; as we have been taught by Ben Jon&s;on to &s;ay, that he had &s;mall Latin and le&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="16">Greek: but, if he had any Latin, he mu&s;t have &s;pelt the word <HI>Exit,</HI> not <HI>Exitte.</HI> To have done, therefore, with <HI>"Kynge Leare,"</HI> at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, the blunders, corruptions, omi&s;&s;ions, in|terpolations, and &s;ophi&s;tications, warrant me in &s;ay|ing, that it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for this MS. of <HI>"Kynge Leare"</HI> to have been the production and hand|writing of Shak&s;peare.</P>
<P>I fear I am not ju&s;tifiable in commenting upon a &s;uppo&s;ed letter from Shak&s;peare at Stratford, to a Printer or Book&s;eller in London, read to me by Mr. Ireland, and not yet made publick, relating to the play of <HI>"Vortygerne;"</HI> which informs us, that the price required for this perhaps-invaluable Drama was demurred at by the &s;ordid trader, al|tho' the Poet profe&s;&s;es to think it one of his be&s;t productions: but I hope I &s;hall be pardoned, even by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the letter, for ob&s;erving that <HI>"The Deed of Tru&s;t to John Hemynge",</HI> in which <HI>"Vorrtygerne"</HI> is given to the unnamed <HI>"Chylde",</HI> is dated 1611; and, that the corre&s;|pondence between the Author and Trader is, I believe, &s;tated or imagined to have occurred af|ter Shak&s;peare's retirement from the &s;tage, to pa&s;s the calm evening of his days at Stratford.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="17">
<P>Strange!&mdash;that the good, the grateful, the ge|nerous Shak&s;peare, &s;hould give a <HI>"Playe neverr yette Impryntedde,"</HI> to a certain <HI>"Chylde &amp; bys heires for everre;"</HI> that he &s;hould then &s;et this very play to &s;ale for publication, at a period when the value of plays depended on their not being printed; and la&s;tly, that, although the writings of this unequalled genius were in his life-time preferred before all others, and this was e&s;teemed by him his be&s;t Play, his demand for it &s;hould not have been "acceeded toe:" but, the immortal Shak&s;peare be reduced to the humiliation of re|que&s;ting that his favourite Play, and the corre&s;|pondence concerning it, &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to him at Stratford upon Avon!</P>
<P><HI>"The Deed of Tru&s;t to John Hemynge"</HI> and this degrading corre&s;pondence, &s;urely, contradict each other!&mdash;admitting the latter to be the fact, what was Shak&s;peare to do with his admired Play at Stratford?&mdash;why not commi&s;&s;ion the per&s;on with whom he had entru&s;ted it, to deliver it to his friend Heminge; that it might be acted in London, or at Bank-&s;ide, for the author or <HI>Chylde's</HI> emolu|ment?&mdash;and not have his darling <HI>"Vorrtygerne"</HI> thrown among lumber, in an ob&s;cure country retirement, to peri&s;h through the ignorance of his &s;urvivors; or, be miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved, un&s;een, unheard-of, nearly two centuries: to enjoy, cum
<PB N="20" REF="18">multis aliis, a kind of re&s;urrection, in which the disjointed fragments of our Poet's mental part are &s;upernaturally gathered together, from <HI>"mye Play offe Kynge Leare"</HI> to a wager <HI>"o 5 Shyl|lynges."</HI></P>
<P>Having thus thrown out a few ha&s;ty reflec|tions, I conclude with a &s;incere wi&s;h; that, &s;hould <HI>Vortigern,</HI> or any other play imputed to Shake|&s;peare, po&s;&s;e&s;s merit enough to warrant the a&s;&s;umption; yet, by critical proce&s;s be proved a forgery: the ingenious impo&s;tor may be ranked with Chatterton in fame; but find better fortune than did that ill-fated, and ever-to-be-lamented youth!</P>

<P>It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome who were inclin|ed to think the <HI>"Mi&s;cellaneous Papers"</HI> genuine, that the Story of this cho&s;en Interlude, as it is termed, of <HI>The Virginn Quene,</HI> related to the hi&s;|tory of our Virgin Queen, Elizabeth, her&s;elf; but, a woman of her ma&s;culine mind could not have en|dured to &s;ee her&s;elf pageanted in a Stage-play, or Interlude; and to have heard the ful&s;ome adulation with which a drama, repre&s;enting her own life and actions, mu&s;t have been fraught: no; common &s;en&s;e a&s;&s;ures us, that the &s;tory mu&s;t have been foreign to her&s;elf, and founded either on ancient hi&s;tory, romance, or fable; or, that it was invent|ed by the poet.</P>
<P>The MS. from which the &s;ubjoined extracts are taken puts the matter out of doubt; <HI>The Virgin Queen</HI> being an evident Sequel to <HI>The Tempe&s;t;</HI> and <HI>Claribel,</HI> a character therein, who was married to the <HI>King of Tunis,</HI> being, for rea|&s;ons which are developed in the Drama, The <HI>Vir|gin</HI> Queen: that it was written by Shak&s;peare I will not take upon me to a&s;&s;ert; yet, it is not likely that any other per&s;on &s;hould attempt a Sequel to what &s;eemed &s;o perfectly concluded as doth the Tem|pe&s;t: but, I may &s;afely &s;ay, that if it was not writ|ten by Shak&s;peare, it is written in direct imitation of him.</P>

<P>The play of <HI>The Virgin Queen,</HI> being, as hath been mentioned, a &s;equel to <HI>The Tempe&s;t,</HI> re&s;umes the &s;tory ju&s;t where it broke off; and opens, on the morning &s;ub&s;equent to the meeting and recon|ciliation of the I&s;landers and the Neapolitan Voyagers, with an Invocation by Ariel of the Sprites, Fairies, Elves, Goblins, &amp;c. in &s;ubjection to Pro&s;pero, to a&s;&s;emble and bid adieu at his em|barkation to their ma&s;ter.

<P>The fourth act brings us acquainted with Ab|dallah, (in <HI>The Tempe&s;t</HI> the namele&s;s) King of Tunis, lately married to Claribel, daughter of Alon&s;o, king of Naples.</P>
<P>In an old geographical book in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, date unknown, is the following pa&s;&s;age;&mdash;</P>

<P>"This whole Countrie (at this day) is called the kingdom of <HI>Tunis:</HI> the king whereof is a kinde of &s;tipendary unto the <HI>Turke:</HI> the people that inhabite there are generally <HI>Sarazens,</HI> and doe profe&s;&s;e <HI>Mahomet.</HI>"</P>

<P>For a royal Prote&s;tant to marry a Papi&s;t, or vice ver&s;a, required a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope; but, to permit the union of a Chri&s;tian prince&s;s and an infidel was, I believe, only in the power of a Poet; who could plead in extenuation, that <HI>"the true&s;t poetry is the mo&s;t feigning."</HI> We &s;hall find, however, by this <HI>Sequel,</HI> that Shak&s;peare, if it be his, was not in&s;en&s;ible of the faux pas he had committed; as the marriage is &s;o very infe|licitous, that the Bride, poor thing! remains a <HI>Virgin:</HI> whence the title of this cho&s;en Play or Interlude, THE VIRGIN QUEEN.</P>
<P>"'Fore the beginning of this play," a Sorce|re&s;s, (formerly leagued with Sycorax, who was bani&s;hed from Argier, or Algiers, to Pro&s;pero's
<PB N="41" REF="39">i&s;le) was enamoured of Abdallah; he rejecting her offers of love, and marrying Claribel, the enraged witch prevents con&s;ummation; conveys the un|happy pair by her <HI>"&s;o potent art"</HI> from Tunis, and holds them in durance: but, for that even Magick cannot quite &s;eparate a loving married pair, they are permitted to &s;ee and conver&s;e with each other daily.</P>
