<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF THE
LIFE AND WRITINGS
OF
OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the Memoirs, which were publi&s;hed in Lon|don, &s;oon after the death of Dr. Gold&s;mith, were &s;everal mi&s;takes, with re&s;pect to our author's age, the time of his admi&s;&s;ion into the college of Dub|lin, &amp;c. which are here corrected from accurate in|formation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>&startq;THE life of a &s;cholar,&endq; Dr. Gold|&s;mith
has remarked, &startq;&s;eldom abounds
with adventure; his fame is acquired in
<PB N="ii" REF="9">
&s;olitude, and the hi&s;torian who only
views him at a di&s;tance, mu&s;t be con|tent
with a dry detail of actions by
which he is &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hed from
the re&s;t of mankind: but we are
fond of talking of tho&s;e who have given
us plea&s;ure, not that we have any thing
important to &s;ay, but becau&s;e the &s;ub|ject
is plea&s;ing.&endq;</P>
<P>Oliver Gold&s;mith, &s;on of the reverend
Charles Gold&s;mith, was born at Elphin,
in he county of Ro&s;common in Ireland,
in the year 1729. His father had four
&s;ons, of whom Oliver was the third.
After being well in&s;tructed in the cla&s;&s;ics,
at the &s;chool of Mr. Hughes, he was ad|mitted
a &s;izer in Trinity-college, Dublin,
on the 11th of June, 1744. While he
re&s;ided there, he exhibited no &s;pecimens
of that genius, which, in his maturer
<PB N="iii" REF="10">
years, rai&s;ed his character &s;o high&punc; On
the 27th of February, 1749, O. S. (two
years after the regular time) he obtained
the degree of Batchelor of Arts. Soon
after, he turned his thoughts to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of phy&s;ic; and, after attending
&s;ome cour&s;es of anatomy in Dublin, pro|ceeded
to Edinburgh, in the year 1751,
where he &s;tudied the &s;everal branches of
medicine under the different profe&s;&s;ors in
that univer&s;ity. His beneficent di&s;po&s;i|tion
&s;oon involved him in unexpected dif|ficulties;
and he was obliged precipitate|ly
to leave Scotland, in con&s;equence of
having engaged him&s;elf to pay a con&s;i|derable
&s;um of money for a fellow-&s;tu|dent.</P>
<P>A few days after, about the beginning
of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunder|land,
near Newca&s;tle, where he was ar|arre&s;ted
<PB N="iv" REF="11">
at the &s;uit of one Barclay, a taylor
in Edinburgh, to whom he had given &s;e|curity
for his friend. By the friend&s;hip
of Mr. Laughlin Maclane and Dr. Sleigh,
who were then in the college, he was &s;oon
delivered out of the hands of the bailiff,
and took his pa&s;&s;age on board a Dutch
&s;hip to Rotterdam, where, after a &s;hort
&s;tay, he proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els. He then
vi&s;ited great part of Flanders; and, after
pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time at Stra&s;bourg and Lou|vain,
where he obtained a degree of Batch|elor
in phy&s;ic, he accompanied an Eng|li&s;h
gentleman to Geneva.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly a fact, that this inge|nious,
unfortunate man, made mo&s;t part
of his tour on foot.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;Countries wear different appearances to tra|vellers of different circum&s;tances. A man who is whirled through Europe in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot, will form very different conclu&s;ions. <HI>Haud inexpertus loquor.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Gold&s;mith's <HI>Pre&s;ent State of Learning in Europe,</HI> 1758.</P></NOTE> He had left Eng|land
<PB N="v" REF="12">
with very little money; and, being
of a philo&s;ophical turn, and at that time
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a body capable of &s;u&s;taining
every fatigue, and a heart not ea&s;ily ter|rified
by danger, he became an enthu&s;ia&s;t
to the de&s;ign he had formed of &s;eeing the
manners of different countries. He had
&s;ome knowledge of the French language,
and of mu&s;ic; he played tolerable well
on the German flute; which, from an
amu&s;ement, became at &s;ome times the
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His learning pro|duced
him an ho&s;pitable reception at mo&s;t
of the religious hou&s;es that he vi&s;ited;
and his mu&s;ic made him welcome to
the pea&s;ants of Flanders and Germany.
<PB N="vi" REF="13">
&startq;Whenever I approached a pea&s;ant's
hou&s;e towards night-fall,&endq; he u&s;ed to
&s;ay, &startq;I played one of my mo&s;t merry
tunes, and that generally procured me
not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for
the next day: but, IN TRUTH&endq; (his
con&s;tant expre&s;&s;ion) &startq;I mu&s;t own, when|ever
I attempted to entertain per&s;ons of
a higher rank, they always thought my
performance odious, and never made
me any return for my endeavours to
plea&s;e them.&endq;</P>
<P>On his arrival at Geneva, he was re|commended
as a proper per&s;on for a tra|velling
tutor to a young man, who had
been unexpectedly left a con&s;iderable &s;um
of money by his uncle Mr. S******.
This youth, who was articled to an attor|ney,
on receipt of his fortune determined
to &s;ee the world; and, on his engaging
<PB N="vii" REF="14">
with his preceptor, made a provi&s;o, that
he &s;hould be permitted to govern him|&s;elf:
and our traveller &s;oon found his pu|pil
under&s;tood the art of directing in mo|ney
concerns extremely well, as avarice
was his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During Gold&s;mith's continuance in
Switzerland, he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated his
poetical talent, of which he had given
&s;ome &s;triking proofs at the college of
Edinburgh. It was from hence he &s;ent
the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his delightful epi&s;tle,
called the TRAVELLER, to his brother
Henry, a clergyman in Ireland, who,
giving up fame and fortune, had retired
with an amiable wife to happine&s;s and ob|&s;curity,
on an income of only forty pounds
a year. The great affection Gold&s;mith
bore for this brother, is thus expre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="viii" REF="15">
the poem abovementioned, and gives a
&s;triking picture of his &s;ituation.</P>
<L>Remote, unfriended, melancholy, &s;low,</L>
<L>Or by the lazy Scheld, or wandering Po;</L>
<L>Or onward, where the rude Carinthian boor,</L>
<L>Again&s;t the hou&s;ele&s;s &s;tranger &s;huts the door;</L>
<L>Or where Campania's plain for&s;aken lies,</L>
<L>A weary wa&s;te expanding to the &s;kies;</L>
<L>Where'er I roam, whatever realms to &s;ee,</L>
<L>My heart untravel'd fondly turns to thee:</L>
<L>Still to my brother turns, with cea&s;ele&s;s pain,</L>
<L>And drags at each remove a length'ning chain:</L>
<L>Eternal bleffings crown my earlie&s;t friend,</L>
<L>And round his dwelling guardian &s;aints attend;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t be that &s;pot, where chearful gue&s;ts retire,</L>
<L>To pau&s;e from toil, and trim their evening fire;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t that abode, where want and pain repair,</L>
<L>And every &s;tranger finds a ready chair;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t be tho&s;e fea&s;ts with &s;imple plenty crown'd,</L>
<L>Where all the ruddy family around,</L>
<L>Laugh at the je&s;ts or pranks that never fail,</L>
<L>Or &s;igh with pity at &s;ome mournful tale;</L>
<L><PB N="ix" REF="16">
Or pre&s;s the ba&s;hful &s;tranger to his food,</L>
<L>And learn the luxury of doing good.</L>
<P>From Geneva Mr. Gold&s;mith and his
pupil proceeded to the &s;outh of France,
where the young man, upon &s;ome di&s;a|greement
with his preceptor, paid him the
&s;mall part of his &s;alary which was due,
and embarked at Mar&s;eilles for England.
Our wanderer was left once more upon
the world at large, and pa&s;&s;ed through a
number, of difficulties in traver&s;ing the
greate&s;t part of France. At length his
curio&s;ity being gratified, he bent his cour&s;e
towards England, and arrived at Dover,
the beginning of the winter, in the year
1758.</P>
<P>His finances were &s;o low on his return&punc;
to England, that he with difficulty got to
the metropolis, his whole &s;tock of ca&s;h
<PB N="x" REF="17">
amounting to no more than a few half-pence!
An entire &s;tranger in London, his
mind was filled with the mo&s;t gloomy re|flections
in con&s;equence of his embarra&s;&s;|ed
&s;ituation! He applied to &s;everal apo|thecaries
in hopes of being received in
the capacity of a journeyman, but his
broad Iri&s;h accent, and the uncouthne&s;s
of his appearance, occa&s;ioned him to
meet with in&s;ult from mo&s;t of the medi|cinal
tribe. The next day, however, a
chymi&s;t near Fi&s;h-&s;treet, &s;truck with his
forlorn condition, and the &s;implicity of
his manner, took him into his laboratory,
where he continued till he di&s;covered that
his old friend Dr. Sleigh was in London.
That gentleman received him with the
warme&s;t affection, and liberally invited
him to &s;hare his pur&s;e till &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
could be procured for him. Gold|&s;mith,
<PB N="xi" REF="18">
unwilling to be a burden to his
friend, a &s;hort time after eagerly embraced
an offer which was made him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
late Rev. Dr. Milner, in in&s;tructing the
young gentlemen at the academy at Peck|ham;
and acquitted him&s;elf greatly to
the Doctor's &s;atisfaction for a &s;hort time;
but, having obtained &s;ome reputation by
the critici&s;ms he had written in the
Monthly Review, Mr. Griffith, the prin|cipal
proprietor, engaged him in the com|pilation
of it; and, re&s;olving to pur&s;ue
the profe&s;&s;ion of writing, he returned to
London, as the mart where abilities of
every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinc|tion
and reward. Here he determined to
adopt a plan of the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy,
and, at the clo&s;e of the year 1759, took
lodgings in Green-Arbour-court in the
Old Bailey, where he wrote &s;everal inge|nious
pieces. The late Mr. Newbery,
<PB N="xii" REF="19">
who, at that time gave great encourage|ment
to men of literary abilities, became
a kind of patron to our young author,
and introduced him as one of the writers
in the Public Ledger,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">During this time, (according to another ac|count) he wrote for the Briti&s;h Magazine, of which Dr. Smollet was then editor, mo&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> and <HI>Tales,</HI> which he afterwards collected and pub|li&s;hed in a &s;eparate volume. He al&s;o wrote occa&s;i|onally, for the Critical Review; and it was the me|rit which he di&s;cotered in critici&s;ing a de&s;picable tran&s;lation of Orid's <HI>Fa&s;ti</HI> by a pedantic &s;chool|ma&s;ter, and his <HI>Enquiry into the Pre&s;ent State of Learning in Europe,</HI> which first introduced him to the acquain$$nce of Dr. Smollet, who recommended him to &s;everal literati, and to mo&s;t of the book&s;el|l$$ by whom he was afterwards patronized.</NOTE> in which his <HI>Citi|zen
of the World</HI> originally appeared, un|der
the the title of &startq;Chine&s;e Letters.&endq;</P>
<P>Fortune now &s;eemed to take &s;ome no|tice
of a man &s;he had long neglected.
<PB N="xiii" REF="20">
The &s;implicity of his character, the integ|rity
of his heart, and the merit of his
productions, made his company very ac|ceptable
to a number of re&s;pectable per|&s;ons;
and, about the middle of the year
1762, he emerged from his mean apart|ments
near the Old Bailey to the politer air
of the Temple, where he took hand&s;ome
chambers, and lived in a genteel &s;tyle.
Among many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction
who were de&s;irous to know him, was the
Duke of Northumberland, and the cir|cum&s;tance
that attended his introduction
to that nobleman, is worthy of being re|lated,
in order to &s;hew a &s;triking trait of
his character. &startq;I was invited,&endq; &s;aid the
Doctor, &startq;by my friend Percy, to wait
upon the Duke, in con&s;equence of the
&s;atisfaction he had received from the
peru&s;al of one of my productions. I
dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the be&s;t manner I
<PB N="xiv" REF="21">
could, and after &s;tudying &s;ome compli|ments
I thought nece&s;&s;ary on &s;uch an
occa&s;ion, proceeded on to Northum|berland-hou&s;e,
and acquainted the ser|vants
that I had particular bu&s;ine&s;s with
his grace. They &s;hewed me into an
antichamber, where, after waiting fome
time, a gentleman very elegantly dre&s;&s;ed
made his appearance: taking him
for the Duke, I delivered all the fine
things I had compo&s;ed, in order to com|pliment
him on the honour he had done
me; when, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment,
he told me I had mi&s;taken him for his
ma&s;ter, who would &s;ee me immediately.
At that in&s;tant the Duke came into the
apartment, and I was &s;o confounded on
the occa&s;ion, that I wanted words barely
&s;ufficient to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e I entertain|ed
of the Duke's politene&s;s, and went
<PB N="xv" REF="22">
away exceedingly chagrined at the blun|der
I had committed.&endq;</P>
<P>The Doctor at the time of this vi&s;it was
much embarra&s;&s;ed in his circum&s;tances,
but vain of the honour done him, was con|tinually
mentioning it. One of tho&s;e in|genious
executors of the law, a bailiff, who
had a writ again&s;t him, determined to turn
this circum&s;tance to his own advantage;
he wrote him a letter, that he was &s;teward
to a nobleman who was charmed with,
reading his la&s;t production, and had or|dered
him to de&s;ire the Doctor to appoint
a place where he might have the honour
of meeting him, to conduct him to his
Lord&s;hip. The vanity of poor Gold&s;mith
immediately &s;wallowed the bait; he ap|pointed
the Briti&s;h Coffee-hou&s;e, to which
he was accompanied by his friend Mr.
Hamilton, the printer of the Critical Re|view,
<PB N="xvi" REF="23">
who in vain remon&s;trated on the &s;in|gularity
of the application. On entering
the coffee-room the bailiff paid his respects
to the Doctor, and de&s;ired that he might
have the honour of immediately attending
him. They had &s;carce entered Pa$l-mall,
in their way <HI>to his Lord&s;hip,</HI> when the bai|liff
produced his writ. Mr. Hamilton
generou&s;ly paid the money, and redeemed
the Doctor from captivity.</P>
<P>The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his
<HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Eng|land,</HI>
was followed by the performance of
his comedy of <HI>The Good-natur'd Man</HI> at
Covent Garden theatre, and placed him
in the fir&s;t rank of the poets of the pre|&s;ent
age.</P>
<P>Our Doctor, as he was now univer&s;ally
called, had a con&s;tant levee of his di&s;tre&s;t
<PB N="xvii" REF="24">
countrymen, who&s;e wants, as far as he
was able, he always relieved; and he has
often been known to leave him&s;elf even
without a guinea, in order to &s;upply the
nece&s;&s;ities of others.</P>
<P>Another feature in his character we
cannot help laying before the reader.
Previous to the publication of his <HI>Desert|ed
Village,</HI> the book&s;eller had given him
a note for one hundred guineas for the
copy, which the Doctor mentioned, a few
hours after, to one of his friends, who
ob&s;erved it was a very great &s;um for &s;o
&s;hort a performance, &startq;In truth,&endq; replied
Gold&s;mith, &startq;I think &s;o too; it is much
more than the hone&s;t man can afford,
or the piece is worth; I have not been
ea&s;y &s;ince I received it; I will therefore
go back and return him his note:&endq;
which he actually did, and left it entirely
<PB N="xviii" REF="25">
to the book&s;eller to pay him according
to the profits produced by the &s;ale of
the poem, which turned out very con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>The author addre&s;&s;es this poem to his
friend Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds. He writes
in the character of a native of a country
village, to which he gives the name of
Auburn, and which he pathetically ad|dre&s;&s;es.
He then proceeds to contra&s;t the
innocence and happine&s;s of a &s;imple and
a natural &s;tate with the mi&s;eries and vices
that have been introduced by poli&s;hed
life, and gives the following beautiful
apo&s;trophe to retirement.</P>
<L>&startq;O ble&s;t retirement, friend to life's decline,</L>
<L>Retreats from care that never mu&s;t be mine;</L>
<L>How ble&s;t is he who crowns, in &s;hades like the&s;e,</L>
<L>A youth of labour with an age of ea&s;e;</L>
<L><PB N="xix" REF="26">
Who quits a world where &s;trong temptations try,</L>
<L>And &s;ince 'tis hard to combat learns to fly.</L>
<L>For him no wretches, born to work and weep,</L>
<L>Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;</L>
<L>No &s;urly porter &s;tands in guilty &s;tate,</L>
<L>To &s;purn imploring famine from his gate;</L>
<L>But on he moves to meet his latter end,</L>
<L>Angels around befriending virtue's friend;</L>
<L>Sinks to the grave with unperceiv'd decay,</L>
<L>While re&s;ignation gently &s;lopes the way;</L>
<L>And all his pro&s;pects brightning to the la&s;t,</L>
<L>His heaven commences ere the world be pa&s;t!&endq;</L>
<P>The de&s;cription of the pari&s;h prie&s;t
(probably intended for a character of his
brother Henry) would have done honour
to any poet of any age. In this de&s;crip|tion
the &s;imile of the bird teaching her
young to fly, and of the mountain that

<P>THE happy knack which you have learnt of puffing your own compofitions, provokes me to come forth.

Your poetic vanity, is as unpardonable as your per&s;onal; would man believe it, and will woman bear it, to be told, that for hours the great Gold&s;mith will &s;tand &s;urveying his grote&s;que Oranthotan's figure in a pier gla&s;s? Was but the lovely H&mdash;k as much enamoured, you would not &s;igh, my gentle &s;wain, in vain. But your vanity is prepo&s;terous. How will this &s;ame bard of Bedlam ring the changes in prai&s;e of Goldy! But what has he to be either proud or vain of? The <HI>Traveller</HI> is a flim&s;y poem, built upon fal&s;e principles; principles diametrically oppo|&s;ite to liberty. What is the <HI>Good-natur'd Man,</HI> but a poor, water-gruel, dramatic do&s;e? What is the <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> but a <HI>pretty</HI> poem, of ea&s;y num|bers, without fancy, dignity, genius, or fire? And pray what may be the la&s;t <HI>&s;peaking pantomime,</HI> &s;o prai&s;ed by the Doctor him&s;elf, but an incoherent piece of &s;tuff, the figure of a woman, with a fi&s;h's tail, without plot, incident, or intrigue? We are made to laugh at &s;tale, dull jokes, wherein we mi&s;|take plea&s;antly for wit, and grimace for humour; wherein every &s;cene is unnatural, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules, the laws of nature and of drama, viz. Two gentlemen come to a man of fortune's hou&s;e, eat, drink, &s;leep, &amp;c. and take it for an inn. The one is intended as a lover to the daughter; he talks with her for &s;ome hours, and when he &s;ees her again in a different dre&s;s, he treats her as a bar girl, and &s;wears me &s;quinted. He abu&s;es the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and threatens to kick him out of his own doors. The &s;quire, whom we are told is to be a fool, proves to be the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible being of the piece; and he makes out a whole act, by bidding his mother lie clo&s;e behind a bu&s;h, per&s;uading her, that his father, her own hu&s;band, is a highwayman, and that he is come to cut their throats; and to give his cou$in an opportunity to go off, he drives his mother over hedges, ditches, and through ponds. Three is not, &s;weet &s;ucking John&s;on, a natural &s;troke in the whole play, but the young fellow's giving the &s;tolen jewels to the mother, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be the landlady. That Mr. Colman did no ju&s;tice to this piece, I hone&s;tly allow; that he told all his friends it would be damned, I po&s;itively aver; and from &s;uch ungenerous in&s;inuations, with|out a dramatic merit, it ro&s;e to public notice: and it is now the <HI>ton</HI> to go to &s;ee it; though I never &s;aw a per&s;on that either liked it or approved it, any more than the ab&s;urd plot <HI>of the Home's</HI> tragedy of <HI>Alonzo.</HI> Mr. Gold&s;mith, correct your arrogance! reduce your vanity; and endeavour to believe, as a man, you are of the plaine&s;t &s;ort; and as an author, but a mortal piece of mediocrity.</P>

<HEAD>&startq; To the PUBLIC.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>LEST it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that I
have been willing to correct in others
an abu&s;e of which I have been guilty
my&s;elf, I beg leave to declare, that in
all my life I never wrote, or dictated,
a &s;ingle paragraph, letter, or e&s;&s;ay, in
a news-paper, except a few moral e&s;&s;ays,
<PB N="xxviii" REF="35">
under the character of a Chine&s;e, about
ten years ago, in the Ledger; and a
letter, to which I &s;igned my name, in
the St. James's Chronicle. If the li|berty
of the pre&s;s therefore has been
abu&s;ed, I have had no hand in it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have always con&s;idered the pre&s;s as
the protector of our freedom, as a watch|ful
guardian, capable of uniting the
weak again&s;t the encroachments of
power. What concerns the public
mo&s;t properly admits of a public di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.
But of late, the pre&s;s has
turned from defending public intere&s;t,
to making inroads upon private life:
from combating the &s;trong, to over|whelming
the feeble. No condition is
now too ob&s;cure for its abu&s;e, and the
protector is become the tyrant of the
people. In this manner the freedom
<PB N="xxix" REF="36">
of the pre&s;s is beginning to &s;ow the
&s;eeds of its own di&s;&s;olution; the great
mu&s;t oppo&s;e it from principle, and the
weak from fear; till at la&s;t every rank
of mankind &s;$all be found to give up
its benefits, content with &s;ecurity from

by which all are indi&s;crimi|nately
abu&s;ed, and by which vice con|&s;equently
e&s;capes in the general cen&s;ure,
I am unable to tell; all I could wi&s;h

again&s;t the injury, &s;o it &s;hould
give calumniators no &s;helter after
having provoked correction. The in|&s;ults
which we receive before the pub|lic,
by being more open are the more
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; by treating them with &s;ilent
contempt, we do not pay a &s;ufficient
<PB N="xxx" REF="37">
deference to the opinion of the world.
By recurring to legal redre&s;s, we too
often expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of the law,
which only &s;erves to increa&s;e our mor|tification
by failing to relieve us. In
&s;hort, every man &s;hould &s;ingly con&s;ider
him&s;elf as a guardian of the liberty of
the pre&s;s, and as far as his influence

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;ucce&s;s of
his pieces, by &s;ome of which, it is a&s;&s;ert|ed,
upon good authority, that he cleared
1800 l. in one year, his circum&s;tances
were by no means in a pro&s;perous &s;itua|tion!
partly owing to the liberality of his
di&s;po&s;ition, and partly to an unfortunate
<PB N="xxxi" REF="38">
habit he had contracted of gaming, with
the arts of which he was very little ac|quainted,
and con&s;equently became the
prey of tho&s;e who were unprincipled
enough to take advantage of his igno|rance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before his death he had formed a
de&s;ign for executing an univer&s;al dictio|nary
of arts and &s;ciences, the <HI>pro&s;pectus</HI>
of which he actually printed and di&s;tri|buted
among his acquaintance. In this
work &s;everal of his literary friends (par|ticularly
Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Dr. John|&s;on,
and Mr. Garrick) had promi&s;ed to
a&s;&s;i&s;t, and to furni&s;h him with articles
upon different &s;ubjects. He had enter|tained
the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations
from the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The undertaking,
however, did not meet with that encourage|ment
from the book&s;ellers which he had
<PB N="xxxii" REF="39">
imagined it would undoubtedly receive;
and he u&s;ed to lament this circum&s;tance
almost to the la&s;t hour of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>He had been for &s;ome years afflicted,
at different times, with a violent &s;tran|gury,
which contributed not a little to
imbitter the latter part of his life; and
which, united with the vexations he &s;uf|fered
upon other occa&s;ions, brought on a
kind of habitual de&s;pondency. In this
unhappy condition he was attacked by a
nervous fever.</P>
<P>On Friday the twenty-fifth of March,
1774, finding him&s;elf extremely ill, he &s;ent
at eleven o'clock at night for Mr. Hawes,
an apothecary, to whom he complained
of a violent pain extending all over the
fore part of his head, his tongue was
moi&s;t, he had no cold &s;hivering, and his
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="40">
pul&s;e beat about ninety &s;trokes in a mi|nute.
He acquainted him he had taken
two ounces of Ipecacuanha wine as a
vomit, and that it was his intention to
take Dr. James's fever powders, which
he de&s;ired him to &s;end him. Mr. Hawes
replied, that in his opinion this medi|cine
was very improper at <HI>that</HI> time, and
begged he would not think of it; but
every argument u&s;ed &s;eemed only to ren|der
him more determined in his own opi|nion.</P>
<P>Mr. Hawes knowing that in preceding
illne&s;&s;es Dr. Gold&s;mith always con&s;ulted
Dr. Fordyce, and that he had expre&s;t the
greate&s;t opinion of his abilities as a phy|&s;ician,
reque&s;ted he might be permitted to
&s;end for him. It was full a quarter of an
hour before Mr. Hawes could obtain his
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="41">
con&s;ent, as the taking Dr. James's pow|ders
appeared to be the only object which
employed his attention; and even then
he endeavoured to throw an ob&s;tacle in
his way, by &s;aying, that Dr. Fordyce was
gone to &s;pend the evening in Gerrard|street,
&startq;where,&endq; added he, &startq;I &s;hould
al&s;o have been, if I had not been indi&s;|po&s;ed.&endq;
Mr. Hawes immediately di&s;|patched
a me&s;&s;enger who found Dr. For|dyce
at home, and who waited on Dr.
Gold&s;mith directly.</P>
<P>Dr. Fordyce repre&s;ented to him the
impropriety of taking the powders in his
<HI>present</HI> &s;ituation; but he was deaf to all
remon&s;trances, and unhappily per&s;i&s;ted in
his own re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="42">
On Saturday morning, March 26, Mr.
Hawes vi&s;ited his patient, he found him
extremely reduced, and hiis pul&s;e was
now become very quick and &s;mall. When
he enquired of him how he did, Dr.
Gold&s;mith &s;ighed deeply, and in a very
low voice &s;aid, &startq;He wi&s;hed he had taken

belonged, and who propo&s;ed to write epi|taphs
on him. He was called on for Re|taliation,

the poem.</P>
<P>The la&s;t work of this ingenious author,

The Doctor &s;eems to have con&s;idered at|tentively
the works of the &s;everal authors
who have wrote on this &s;ubject. If there
&s;hould not be a great deal of di&s;covery,
or new matter, yet a judicious &s;election
from abundant materials, is no &s;mall
prai&s;e, and if the experiments and di&s;co|veries
of other writers are laid open in an
agreeable dre&s;s, &s;o plea&s;ing as to allure
the young reader into a pur&s;uit of this
&s;ort of knowledge, we have no &s;mall ob|ligations
to this very engaging writer.</P>
<P>Our author profe&s;&s;es to have had a ta&s;te
rather cla&s;&s;ical than &s;cientific, and it was
in the &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics, that he fir&s;t
caught the de&s;ire of attaining a knowledge
of nature. Pliny fir&s;t in&s;pired him, and
he re&s;olved to tran&s;late that agreeable
writer, and by the help of a commentary
<PB N="xlvii" REF="54">
to make his tran&s;lation acceptable to the
public.</P>
<P>It is not to be que&s;tioned that Dr.
Gold&s;mith, had he followed that plan,
would have marked out tho&s;e inaccura|cies
and extravagancies, into which an
ea&s;y credulity, or a want of attention, or
the little progre&s;s of &s;cience in the world,
in his age, had &s;educed his original au|thor,
and are the blemi&s;hes of that inge|nious,
inqui&s;itive, and laborious writer.</P>
<P>The appearance of Mr. Buffon's work,
however, induced the Doctor to change
his plan, and in&s;tead of tran&s;lating an
ancient writer, he re&s;olved to imitate the
la&s;t and be&s;t of the modern, who had
written on natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="xlviii" REF="55">
The Doctor acknowledges to have the
highe&s;t obligations to Buffon, as far as
Buffon's work extend, and he could not,
we imagine, have cho&s;en to him&s;elf a
better guide. The Doctor &s;eems to pro|fe&s;s
that from his fir&s;t intention of a trans|lation,
to his execution of this work, his
great object was to &s;end out an agreeable
work, and, without flattery, this we think
he has effected.</P>
<P>We will not pre&s;ume to decide whether
the adept will find him&s;elf enlightened,
or his information extended, but undoubt|edly
the common reader will find his cu|rio&s;ity
gratified, and that time agreeably
di&s;po&s;ed of, which he be&s;tows on this
work, and this &s;eems to have been the
object of the writer; and an author who
has effected what he has propo&s;ed, is un|doubtedly
intitled to all the prai&s;e that

the nature of the work he has undertaken
can pretend to.</P>
<P>Every reader of ta&s;te has long regretted
that the poetical writings of this author
have hitherto been only published in a de|&s;ultory

think there is any great re&s;emblance between the
two pieces in que&s;tion. If there be any, his ballad
is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, &s;ome
years ago; and he (as we both con&s;idered the&s;e
things as trifles at be&s;t) told me with his u&s;ual good
humour, the next time I &s;aw him, that he had taken
my plan to form the fragments of Shake&s;peare into
a ballad of his own. He then read me his little
Cento, if I may &s;o call it, and I highly approved
it. Such petty anecdotes as the&s;e are &s;carce worth
printing: and, were it not for the bu&s;y di&s;po&s;ition

<PB N="31" REF="99">
<HEAD>TO THE
REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the friend&s;hip between us can
acquire no new force from the ceremonies of a De|dication;
and perhaps it demands an excu&s;e thus to
prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline
giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem
was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the
whole can now, with propriety, be only in&s;cribed
to you. It will al&s;o throw a light upon many parts
of it, when the reader under&s;tands, that it is ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to a man, who, de&s;pi&s;ing Fame and Fortune,
has retired early to Happine&s;s and Ob&s;curity, with
an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wi&s;dom of
your humble choice. You have entered upon a &s;a|cred
office, where the harve&s;t is great, and the la|bourers
are but few; while you have left the field
of Ambition, Where the labourers are many, and
<PB N="32" REF="100">
the harve&s;t not worth carrying away. But of all
kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the
times, from different &s;y&s;tems of critici&s;m, and from
the divi&s;ions of party, that which pur&s;ues poetical
fame is the wilde&s;t.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amu&s;ement among un|poli&s;hed
nations; but in a country verging to the
extremes of refinement, Painting and Mu&s;ic come
in for a &s;hare. As the&s;e offer the feeble mind a le&s;s
laborious entertainment, they at fir&s;t rival Poetry,
and at length &s;upplant her; they engro&s;s all that
favour once &s;hewn to her, and, though but younger
&s;i&s;ters, &s;eize upon the elder's birthright.</P>
<P>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the
powerful, it is &s;till in greater danger from the mi&s;|taken
efforts of the learned to improve it. What
critici&s;ms have we not heard of late in favour of
blank ver&s;e, and Pindaric odes, choru&s;&s;es, anape&s;ts
and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence!
Every ab&s;urdity has now a champion to defend it;
and as he is generally much in the wrong, &s;o
he has always much to &s;ay; for error is ever talk|ative.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art &s;till more dan|gerous,
I mean Party. Party entirely di&s;torts the
judgment, and de&s;troys the ta&s;te. When the mind
is once infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, it can only find
<PB N="33" REF="101">
plea&s;ure in what contributes to increa&s;e the di&s;tem|per.
Like the tyger, that &s;eldom de&s;i&s;ts from pur|&s;uing
man, after having once preyed upon human
fle&s;h, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite
with calumny, makes, ever after, the mo&s;t agree|able
fea&s;t upon murdered reputation. Such readers
generally admire &s;ome half-witted thing, who wants
to be thought a bold man, having lo&s;t the character
of a wi&s;e one. Him they dignify with the name of
poet: his tawdry lampoons are called &s;atires; his
turbulence is &s;aid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a Poem may find, which has nei|ther
abu&s;e, party, nor blank ver&s;e to &s;upport it, I
cannot tell, nor am I &s;olicitous to know. My aims
are right. Without e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of any party,
I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I
have endeavoured to &s;hew, that there may be equal
happine&s;s in &s;tates, that are differently governed
from our own; that every &s;tate has a particular prin|ciple
of happine&s;s, and that this principle in each
may be carried to a mi&s;chievous exce&s;s. There are
few can judge, better than your&s;elf, how far the&s;e
po&s;itions are illu&s;trated in this Poem. I am,</P>

<P>I CAN have no expectations in an addre&s;s of this
kind, either to add to your reputation, or to e&s;tab|li&s;h
my own. You can gain nothing from my ad|miration,
as I am ignorant of that art in which
you are &s;aid to excel; and I may lo&s;e much by the
&s;everity of your judgment, as few have a ju&s;ter
ta&s;te in poetry than you. Setting intere&s;t there|fore
a&s;ide, to which I never paid much attention,
I mu&s;t be indulged at pre&s;ent in following my af|fections.
The only dedication I ever made was to
my brother, becau&s;e I loved him better than mo&s;t
other men. He is &s;ince dead. Permit me to in|&s;cribe
this poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be plea&s;ed with the ver&s;ification
and meer mechanical parts of this attempt, I do not
pretend to inquire; but I know you will object
<PB N="56" REF="121">
(and indeed &s;everal of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t friends
concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it de|plores
is no where to be &s;een, and the di&s;orders it
laments are only to be found in the poet's own
imagination. To this I can &s;carce make any other
an&s;wer than that I &s;incerely believe what I have
written; that I have taken all po&s;&s;ible pains, in my
country excur&s;ions, for the&s;e four or five years pa&s;t,
to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views
and inquiries have led me to believe tho&s;e mi&s;eries
real, which I here attempt to di&s;play. But this is
not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the
country be depopulating, or not; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion
would take up much room, and I &s;hould prove my|&s;elf,
at be&s;t, an indifferent politician, to tire the
reader with a long preface, when I want his unfa|tigued
attention to a long poem.</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country,
I inveigh again&s;t the increa&s;e of our luxuries; and
here al&s;o I expect the &s;hout of modern politicians
again&s;t me. For twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, it
has been the fa&s;hion to con&s;ider luxury as one of
the greate&s;t national advantages; and all the wi&s;|dom
of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous.
Still, however, I mu&s;t remain a profe&s;&s;ed ancient
on that head, and continue to think tho&s;e luxu|ries
prejudicial to &s;tates, by which &s;o many vices
are introduced, and &s;o many kingdoms have been
<PB N="57" REF="122">
undone. Indeed &s;o much has been poured out of
late on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that, meerly
for the &s;ake of novelty and variety, one would
&s;ometimes wi&s;h to be in the right. I am,</P>
