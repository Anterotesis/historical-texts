<HEAD>THE Succe&s;&s;ion TO THE Crown of England, <HI>Con&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was Remarkable, That the Very Day the <HI>Peace</HI> was Proclaim'd in <HI>London,</HI> the Moon was in a Total Eclip&s;e, which hap|pened to be extreamly Vi&s;ible, ju&s;t as we were making Bonefires for Joy.</P>
<P>I am no Dreamer of Dreams, nor the Son of a Prophet; but I cou'd not avoid hav|ing &s;ome little Concern at the Sight, it &s;eem'd &s;o Directly to tell us, <HI>That our Peace would have &s;ome unexpected Eclip&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Since the Succe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>French-man</HI> to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, has given us further Cau&s;e to expect an Eclip&s;e upon our Peace Abroad, it were to be wi&s;ht that our Peace at Home therefore were a little better &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The Death of the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> was the fir&s;t Blow which &s;eem'd particularly to affect the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> after the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace, which may very ju&s;tly be accounted a Misfortune to the Nation, 1. By putting us to the trouble of looking about the World for a Succe&s;&s;or, 2. By giving Preten&s;ions of Right to &s;uch People as our Con&s;titution barrs from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Crown. And 3<HI>dly,</HI> By giving the <HI>Scots</HI> Opportunity again to Choo&s;e whether they will join in a Settle|ment with Us or no.</P>
<P>Since then the Succe&s;&s;ion of Crowns, and Revolutions of Kingdoms are &s;o much the general Subjects of Di&s;cour&s;e at this time, 'tis thought it may not be altogether Impro|per, at lea&s;t for <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to &s;u&s;pend a lit|tle their Concern for the Events of Foreign Affairs, and ca&s;t their Eyes upon their Own.</P>
<P>The League of Partition; the late King of <HI>Spain's</HI> Will; the accepting that Will by the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
King of <HI>France,</HI> in favour of the Duke <HI>d'An|jou;</HI> the Emperor declaring in Right of the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles;</HI> the Letters from and to <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Paris;</HI> the Memorial of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Hague;</HI> the Proce&s;s of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Envoy at <HI>Madrid;</HI> the Entry of the <HI>French</HI> Troops into <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Milan,</HI> and the like, <HI>are Matters which take up the Thoughts, and Employ the Heads of our Po|liticians, who fill us with their Ob&s;ervations and Speculations relating to the</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e things, however Material in them&s;elves, and Eventually of Concern to us, Ought not <HI>&s;o to Divert us,</HI> as that we &s;hou&punc;d forget the proper Juncture which &s;eems to be at hand, in which an Article will come before us, the Debate whereof is infi|nitely of more Con&s;equence than all the&s;e, to us in Particular, if not to <HI>Europe</HI> in General, and that is, <HI>The Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown of</HI> Eng|land.</P>
<P>The Settlement of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> made by Parliament on the Abdication of the late King, &s;eems to require &s;ome further Con&s;ideration: Fate has made Two Melan|choly Infractions in the Pro&s;pect we had of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
a Race of Kings from the Line of the pre|&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, by the Death of the late Queen, and the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis Evident that if the Prince&s;s <HI>Ann</HI> has no more Children, and His Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd continue to decline Marrying, <HI>both which are but too probable,</HI> the Settlement of the Crown as made by Con&s;ent of Parliament is at a full Stop, and it remains, That the &s;ame Autho|rity of Parliament &s;hou'd Con&s;ider who&s;e Right it is to Succeed.</P>
<P>I do not think fit to Decide here, Whe|ther the Power of Making and Declaring Kings and Succe&s;&s;ions, be Ve&s;ted in the Body of the People Collectively or Repre&s;entative|ly. <HI>Originally,</HI> I think, there is no body ever di&s;puted it, but 'tis immaterial in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it has been Debated and Decided; <HI>the Parliament have a&s;&s;erted their Right in its Practice and Extent,</HI> and the pre&s;ent Con&s;ti|tution of <HI>England</HI> &s;tands firm upon the Ba&s;is of that Right.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I inquire, much le&s;s Dictate what the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>England</HI> a&s;&s;embl'd in Parliament may or may not think &s;it to do in the Matter of our Succe&s;&s;ion, but &s;hall go on to Examine who they are, who, on the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Expiration of the pre&s;ent Settlement, may put in their Claims to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, and in what particular Circum&s;tan|ces of Right &s;uch Claimant may now &s;tand, re&s;pecting both the Con&s;titution and Intere&s;t of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> fini&s;hed the Line of our <HI>Engli&s;h Saxon</HI> Kings; the Blood of the <HI>Plantagenets</HI> and <HI>Tudors</HI> were Extinct in all the Branches of them, excepting the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who being Grandmother to <HI>James</HI> the VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Devolv'd upon the Fa|mily of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> in Right of that Match, and &s;o he was Proclaimed King of <HI>England,</HI> by the Name of <HI>King James the First.</HI></P>
<P>This King had by Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the following Offspring which 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to mention, becau&s;e we &s;hall meet with them again in the farther Pro&s;ecution of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>He had Two Sons, <HI>Henry,</HI> who died unmarried:</P>
<P>And <HI>Charles,</HI> who Succeeded him in the Throne.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
And, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Married to the <HI>Pal&s;grave,</HI> af|terwards King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but Beaten out of both by the Emperor.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> left Three Sons, <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> who being re-in&s;tated in the Inheritance of his Father, was Elector <HI>Pala|tine,</HI> and <HI>Pal&s;grave,</HI> and who&s;e Po&s;terity we &s;hall meet with again; <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Rupert,</HI> who died without I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides younger Daughters, one Daughter <HI>Sophia,</HI> Married to <HI>Ernest Augu&s;tus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI> by whom &s;he had the pre|&s;ent Duke Elector of <HI>Brum&s;wick,</HI> with Two Sons and one Daughter married to the pre&s;ent Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> which Duke of <HI>Hanno|ver</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand fair to Claim whatever De|volves upon that Branch by the right of a Marriage from a Daughter of <HI>England,</HI> in Ca&s;e the Male-Line of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t &s;hould fail, which we come n$xt to con&s;i|der.</P>

<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Second, left no Legitimate I&s;|&s;ue, except One Son, <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth,</HI> who&s;e Birth happening in the Time of his Father's Exile, it remained a Doubt whether he was Legitimate or no; and &s;ome People have affirm'd the <HI>Contract of Marriage with his Mother,</HI> was re&s;erv'd, and had been produced to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, if the <HI>Bill of Exclu&s;ion</HI> had not &s;unk in the <HI>Embrio,</HI> whereby all tho&s;e De&s;igns proving Abortive, the Witne&s;&s;es peri&s;hed in the <HI>General Destru|ction</HI> of his Party, which from that time to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. were Bani&s;hed, drawn into Plots, and died by the <HI>Ax</HI> or <HI>Halter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
After the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> in Arms, and publi&s;hed a <HI>Declaration,</HI> not &s;o much found|ed on his <HI>Right by Birth,</HI> as upon the <HI>Male|administration</HI> of King <HI>James,</HI> but withal re|ferring the <HI>Examination of his own Legitimacy to a Free Parliament,</HI> but he lo&s;t the <HI>Day</HI> and his <HI>Life;</HI> and &s;o the Legitimacy of his Birth remains <HI>undi&s;covered</HI> to this day, and he &s;tands <HI>attainted in blood</HI> by Parliament, as an <HI>effectual Bar</HI> again&s;t any Claim in his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. publickly di&s;own'd him as Legitimate, and declared <HI>he was not married to his Mother;</HI> but &s;till had there been any Authentick Proof of the Affir|mative, I pre&s;ume that <HI>Declaration</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> had been of &s;mall Value, e&s;pecially if the Fight at <HI>Sedgmore</HI> had favour'd him with Power to have backt that <HI>Affirmative</HI> with the <HI>longe&s;t Sword;</HI> for Victory, which <HI>gives Crowns,</HI> takes off <HI>Attainders,</HI> and makes any body Le|gitimate.</P>
<P>To King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>James</HI> the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> by who&s;e Abdication the Crown is Devolved on King <HI>William,</HI> and Settled by
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Parliament on the Prince&s;s <HI>Ann</HI> and her Chil|dren, and on Default of &s;uch I&s;&s;ue, to the Heirs of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Now neither His Maje&s;ty nor the Prince&s;s having any Children, it remains to examine who are the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t Rank all the <HI>Pretenders to the Blood Royal of</HI> England which are now in be|ing, and Con&s;ider their Preten&s;ions after|wards.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not call Her <HI>Royal Highne&s;s</HI> the Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Ann</HI> a Pretender, becau&s;e She is <HI>Heir Ap|parent, Included and Declared in the pre&s;ent Act of Settlement.</HI> Nor &s;hall I go back to her Fa|ther, who &s;tands Excluded <HI>by his own Act and Deed,</HI> and the Ca&s;e already Decided by Par|liament: For as I &s;hall not pretend to que|&s;tion <HI>Acts of Parliament and Settlements made by the Commons of</HI> England; &s;o I &s;hall not &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;t, that what they have done needs my weak Pen to Vindicate or De|fend.</P>
<P>But waving tho&s;e Two Articles, I proceed to Name the pre&s;ent Claimants in Being, who&s;e <HI>Legitimacy is indi&s;putable,</HI> and who&s;e Titles are ju&s;t and undeniable, &s;o fat as

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They tell us, That if the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;hall make an Offer of &s;ending hi|ther her Son the Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI> to be brought up in the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> we can|not deny him the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> he being Grand|&s;on to a Daughter of <HI>England.</HI></P>

his Preten&s;ions, or dying without I&s;&s;ue, may Claim in Right of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> Daughter to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who is without Que&s;tion the next Heir&punc; And tho' by <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> we have thought fit to Exclude them, becau&s;e <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> it may be a good rea&s;on to us to oppo&s;e her, but it can be no good rea&s;on again&s;t her putting in her Claim, and the Sword, &s;ay they, mu&s;t decide it.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The&s;e are Two <HI>Points</HI> which require &s;ome <HI>Con&s;ideration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As to the Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI>'s being brought over hither to be educated a <HI>Prote|&s;tant:</HI> I make no Que&s;tion but the Prince of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> after his Mother the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> is the Next Heir to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown, and, &s;aving to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the Right of <HI>di&s;po&s;ing the Engli&s;h Government</HI> &s;o, and to &s;uch Hands as they have either Power or ju&s;t Rea&s;on to do if the Pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment was Extin$t, I know nothing cou'd $word$ &s;aid in Bar of his Title but his <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I mu&s;t $word$ farther, and &s;ay, That even the Prince who&punc; &s;hall Claim being a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Pro|fe&s;t, does not <HI>weaken his Claim of Right,</HI> it only Bars the Door again&s;t him, that he can|not get at it. The Act of Parliament <HI>Exclu|ding a</HI> Roman Catholick <HI>from the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ion and Crown,</HI> does not le&s;&s;en that Prince's <HI>Right of Claim,</HI> but it makes it <HI>unlawful</HI> for us to receive him unle&s;s he turn <HI>Prote&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Piedmont</HI> is not le&s;s an Heir to the <HI>Crown of England</HI> for being a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> but <HI>England</HI> is rendred Foreign to him by the <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> whereby he <HI>&s;tands excluded;</HI> that is, the Nation is arm'd by Law again&s;t receiving him; and this is ap|parent, becau&s;e that Hour that any &s;uch Prince profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a <HI>Protestant,</HI> his Right takes place, and that which before was Lawful to do, <HI>viz. to oppo&s;e him,</HI> would be then <HI>High Trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>It may be ask'd here,</HI> If when your Throne is Vacant you pa&s;s by the Right Heir becau&s;e he is a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and proceed to the next who is a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant;</HI> If this Heir afterward turn <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> is not his Claim then Right, and ought not the Incumbent to relinqui&s;h it to him?</HEAD>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> In De&s;cent of E&s;tates &s;uch an <HI>Obje|ction</HI> may be good, but in that of <HI>Crowns</HI> it
<PB N="18" REF="17">
cannot be, Becau&s;e the <HI>Crown is entred upon by mutual Stipulation,</HI> and if ye have <HI>Once admit|ted an Heir into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and a <HI>Coronation</HI> has pa&s;t, which is the <HI>Seal of the Contract,</HI> Nothing but <HI>Male-admini&s;tration, Death</HI> or <HI>Defection</HI> can di&s;&s;olve the Peoples <HI>Allegiance.</HI></P>
<P>But if &s;uch Prince will qualifie him&s;elf for the <HI>Crown,</HI> and turn <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> he mu&s;t do it in Time, and before the <HI>Right of Devolution</HI> fall. For <HI>Crowns</HI> are not to be <HI>tran&s;pos'd,</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms change Masters</HI> as often as Princes plea&s;e to change their <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>If then the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> is willing to breed her Son up in the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> in Order to qualifie him to enjoy the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the Way is, in my poor Opinion, fir&s;t to &s;end him into <HI>England,</HI> and commit him to &s;uch <HI>Governours as the Nation may be very well &s;atisfied in,</HI> &s;uch as are Eminently Pious, Zealous, <HI>unbia&s;t</HI> and <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted;</HI> if the <HI>Government will appoint them</HI> 'twill be &s;o much the better; and, when this is fir&s;t done, an Amba&s;&s;ador may apply him&s;elf <HI>to the King and Parliament</HI> with &s;ome Ground, but to Treat of it as at the pre&s;ent Di&s;tance, &s;eems too Re|mote for us to Concern our &s;elves about it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">

his <HI>&s;everal Bani&s;hments,</HI> his <HI>Flight, Impri&s;on|ment,</HI> and <HI>la&s;t Moments</HI> are more than &s;uffi|cient, had they been for the <HI>Popi&s;h In|tere&s;t,</HI> to have given him the Title of a <HI>Martyr.</HI></P>
<P>Since the late Happy Revolution, Care has been taken to Vindicate the Honour of &s;ome <HI>Noble Families</HI> who fell in the &s;ame Calamities: The <HI>Sufferings of others</HI> have been Con&s;idered, Even to the mo&s;t <HI>Contemptible Per&s;ons</HI> of <HI>F</HI>&mdash;and Dr. <HI>O</HI>&mdash;.
