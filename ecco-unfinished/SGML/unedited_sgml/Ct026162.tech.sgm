<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK my&s;elf greatly obli|ged
to you, and de&s;ire you
to accept my mo&s;t grateful
thanks, for the valuable pre|&s;ent
you have done me the ho|nour
to make me, of your Ac|count
of Cor&s;ica, which has
given me the plea&s;ure of being
more perfectly acquainted with
the greate&s;t character of this
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
age. I had gained &s;ome know|ledge
of it, before I &s;aw your
book, from the letters of ano|ther
Engli&s;h gentleman on that
&s;ubject; but you have added
many curious and intere&s;ting
particulars, which I have read
with much delight and admira|tion.
If I were a few years
younger. I would go in pilgri|mage
to Cor&s;ica (as you have
done) to vi&s;it this living image
of ancient virtue, and to vene|rate
in the mind of PASCAL
PAOLI the &s;pirit of TIMOLE|ON
and EPAMINONDAS. But I
mu&s;t now be content with &s;ee|ing
him in your de&s;cription,
the vivacity of which &s;hews,
that your heart is inflamed
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
with the &s;ame generous pa&s;&s;ion
which glows &s;o brightly in his.
I wi&s;h with you that our go|vernment
had &s;hewn more re|&s;pect
for Cor&s;ican liberty, and
think it di&s;graces our nation
that we do not live in good
friend&s;hip with a brave people
engaged in the noble&s;t of all
conte&s;ts, a conte&s;t again&s;t ty|ranny,
and who have never
given us any cau&s;e of com|plaint.
Be&s;ides &s;ympathy of
&s;entiment, which is a natural
bond of union, we ought in po|licy
to &s;hew as much regard
for them, as the Genoe&s;e, their
oppre&s;&s;ors, have &s;hewn for the
French, in our late wars with
that nation.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO apology &s;hall be made for pre&s;ent|ing
the world with an Account of
Cor&s;ica. It has been for &s;ome time ex|pected
from me; and I own that the ar|dour
of publick curio&s;ity has both encou|raged
and intimidated me. On my re|turn
from vi&s;iting Cor&s;ica, I found people
wherever I went, de&s;irous to hear what I
could tell them concerning that i&s;land
and its inhabitants. Unwilling to repeat
my tale to every company, I thought it
be&s;t to promi&s;e a book which &s;hould &s;peak
for me.</P>
<P>But I would not take upon me to do
this, till I con&s;ulted with the General of
the nation. I therefore informed him of
my de&s;ign. His an&s;wer is perhaps too
flattering for me to publi&s;h: but I mu&s;t
beg leave to give it as the licence and
&s;anction of this work.</P>
<P>Paoli was plea&s;ed to write to me thus:
&startq;Non pu&ograve; e&s;&s;er piu genero&s;o il di lei di|&s;egno
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
di pubblicar colle &s;tampe le o&s;&s;erva|zioni
che ha fatte &s;opra la Cor&s;ica. Ella
ne ha veduto la fi&s;ica &s;ituazione, ha potu|to
e&s;aminare i co&s;tumi degli abitanti, e
veder dentro le ma&s;&s;ime del loro governo,
di cui cono&s;ce la co&s;tituzione. Que&s;ti po|poli
con entu&s;ia&s;mo di gratitudine uniran|no
il loro applau&s;o a quello dell' Europa
di&s;ingannata. Nothing can be more ge|nerous
than your de&s;ign to publi&s;h the
ob&s;ervations which you have made upon
Cor&s;ica. You have &s;een its natural &s;itua|tion,
you have been able to &s;tudy the
manners of its inhabitants, and to &s;ee in|timately
the maxims of their govern|ment,
of which you know the con&s;titu|tion.
This people with an enthu&s;ia&s;m of
gratitude, will unite their applau&s;e with
that of undeceived Europe.&endq;</P>
<P>My fir&s;t intention was to give only a
view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Cor&s;ica, toge|ther
with Memoirs of its illu&s;trious Ge|neral.
But by the advice of &s;ome learned
friends, who&s;e judgement I re&s;pect, I en|larged
my plan, and fixed on that of the
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
execution of which the publick is now to
judge.</P>
<P>I had before me two French books
expre&s;sly written on Cor&s;ica. The one
&startq;Hi&s;toire de l'I&s;le de Cor&s;e, par M. G. D. C.&endq;
printed at Nancy in 1749. The other
&startq;Memoires Hi&s;toriques &amp;c. par M. Jau&s;|&s;in
Ancien Apoticaire Major;&endq; printed at
Lau&s;anne in 1758. From both of tho&s;e
books I derived many u&s;eful materials.
The la&s;t of them contains a full and &s;ci|entifick
detail of the natural hi&s;tory of
the i&s;land, as al&s;o many letters, manife&s;|toes
and other papers: and both of them
contain a variety of particulars with re|gard
to the operations of the French in
Cor&s;ica. I had al&s;o before me a pretty
large collection of remarks, which I had
committed to writing, while I was in the
i&s;land.</P>
<P>But I &s;till found my materials defici|ent
in many re&s;pects. I therefore applied
to my friends abroad; and in the mean
time directed my &s;tudies to &s;uch books
as might furni&s;h me with any thing re|lative
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
to the &s;ubject. I am thus enabled
to lay before the world &s;uch An Account
of Cor&s;ica, as I flatter my&s;elf will give &s;ome
&s;atisfaction; for, in compari&s;on of the ve|ry
little that has been hitherto known
concerning that i&s;land, this book may be
&s;aid to contain a great deal.</P>
<P>It is indeed amazing that an i&s;land &s;o
con&s;iderable, and in which &s;uch noble
things have been doing, &s;hould be &s;o im|perfectly
known. Even the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
Chiefs has been unperceived; and becau&s;e
we have read of Paoli being at the head of
the Cor&s;icans many years back, and Paoli
&s;till appears at their head, the command
has been &s;uppo&s;ed all this time in the per|&s;on
of the &s;ame man. Hence all our news|papers
have confounded the gallant Pa&s;|cal
Paoli in the vigour of manhood, with
the venerable chief his decea&s;ed Father
Giacinto Paoli. Nay the &s;ame errour has
found its way into the page of the hi&s;to|rian;
for Dr. Smollet when mentioning
Paoli at the &s;iege of Furiani a few years
ago, &s;ays he was then pa&s;t four&s;core.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18">
I would in the fir&s;t place return my
mo&s;t humble thanks to Pa&s;cal Paoli, for
the various communications with which
he has been plea&s;ed to favour me; and as
I have related his remarkable &s;ayings, I
declare upon honour, that I have neither
added nor dimini&s;hed; nay &s;o &s;crupulous
have I been, that I would not make the
&s;malle&s;t variation even when my friends
thought it would be an improvement.
I know with how much plea&s;ure we read
what is perfectly authentick.</P>
<P>Count Rivarola was &s;o good as to re|turn
me full and di&s;tinct an&s;wers to a
variety of queries which I &s;ent him with re|gard
to many particulars concerning Cor|&s;ica.
I am much indebted to him for
this, and particularly &s;o, from the obli|ging
manner in which he did it.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. Burnaby, chaplain
to the Briti&s;h factory at Leghorn, made a
tour to Cor&s;ica in 1766, at the &s;ame time
with the honourable and reverend Mr.
Hervey now bi&s;hop of Cloyne. Mr. Bur|naby
was ab&s;ent from Leghorn when I
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">
was there, &s;o I had not the plea&s;ure of be|ing
per&s;onally known to him. But he with
great politene&s;s of his own accord, fent me
a copy of the Journal which he made of
what he ob&s;erved in Cor&s;ica. I had the
&s;atisfaction to find that we agreed in every
thing which both of us had con&s;idered.
But I found in his Journal, ob&s;ervations
on &s;everal things which I had omitted;
and &s;everal things which I had remarked,
I found &s;et in a clearer light. As Mr. Bur|naby
was &s;o obliging as to allow me to
make what u&s;e I plea&s;ed of his Journal, I
have freely interwoven it into my work.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my obligations to my
e&s;teemed friend Sir John Dick, Bart. his
Britannick Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ul at Leghorn, to
Signor Gian Quilico Ca&s;a Bianca, to the
learned Greek phy&s;ician Signor Stefano|poli,
to Colonel Buttafoco, and to the Ab|b&eacute;
Ro&s;tini. The&s;e gentlemen have all con|tributed
their aid in erecting my little mo|nument
to liberty.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o to thank an ingenious gentle|man
who has favoured me with the tran&s;|lations
<PB N="xix" REF="20">
of Seneca's Epigrams. I made ap|plication
for this favour, in the London
Chronicle; and to the honour of litera|ture,
I found her votaries very liberal. Se|veral
tran&s;lations were &s;ent, of which I
took the liberty to prefer tho&s;e which had
the &s;ignature of Patricius, and which were
improved by another ingenious corre&s;pon|dent
under the &s;ignature of Plebeius. By
a &s;ub&s;equent application I begged that Pa|tricius
would let me know to whom I was
obliged for what I con&s;idered as a great
ornament to my book. He has complied
with my reque&s;t; and I beg leave in this
publick manner, to acknowledge that I
am indebted for tho&s;e tran&s;lations to Tho|mas
Day E&s;quire, of Berk&s;hire, a gentle|man
who&s;e &s;ituation in life is genteel, and
his fortune affluent. I mu&s;t add that al|though
his ver&s;es have not only the fire
of youth, but the maturity and correctne&s;s
of age, Mr. Day is no more than nine|teen.</P>
<P>Nor can I omit to expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of
the candour and politene&s;s with which
<PB N="xx" REF="21">
Sir James Steuart received the remark
which I have ventured to make in op|po&s;ition
to a pa&s;&s;age concerning the Cor&s;i|cans,
in his Inquiry into the Principles of
Political Oeconomy.</P>
<P>I have &s;ubmitted my book to the re|vi&s;al
of &s;everal gentlemen who honour
me with their regard, and I am &s;en&s;ible
how much it is improved by their cor|rections.
It is therefore my duty to re|turn
thanks to the reverend Mr. Wyvill
rectour of Black Notely in E&s;&s;ex, and to
my old and mo&s;t intimate friend the re|verend
Mr. Temple rectour of Mamhead
in Devon&s;hire. I am al&s;o obliged to My
Lord Monboddo for many judicious re|marks,
which his thorough acquaintance
with ancient learning enabled him to
make. But I am principally indebted to
the indulgence and friendly attention of
My Lord Hailes, who under the name of
Sir David Dalrymple<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is the cu&s;tom in Scotland to give the Judges of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion the title of Lords by the names of their e&s;tates. Thus Mr. Burnett is Lord Monboddo, and Sir David Dalrymple is Lord Hailes.</NOTE>, has been long
<PB N="xxi" REF="22">
known to the world as an able Antiqua|rian,
and an elegant and humourous E&s;|&s;ayi&s;t;
to whom the world has no fault
but that he does not give them more of
his own writings, when they value them
&s;o highly.</P>
<P>I would however have it under&s;tood,
that although I received the corrections
of my friends with deference, I have not
always agreed with them. An authour
&s;hould be glad to hear every candid re|mark.
But I look upon a man as unwor|thy
to write, who has not force of mind
to determine for him&s;elf. I mention this,
that the judgement of the friends I have
named may not be con&s;idered as con|nected
with every pa&s;&s;age in this book.</P>
<P>Writing a book I have found to be like
building a hou&s;e. A man forms a plan,
and collects materials. He thinks he has
enough to rai&s;e a large and &s;tately edifice;
but after he has arranged, compacted and
poli&s;hed, his work turns out to be a very
&s;mall performance. The authour howe|ver
like the builder, knows how much
<PB N="xxii" REF="23">
labour his work has co&s;t him; and there|fore
e&s;timates it at a much higher rate
than other people think it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to avoid an o&s;ten|tatious
di&s;play of learning. By the idle
and the frivolous indeed, any appearance
of learning is called pedantry. But as I
do not write for &s;uch readers, I pay no
regard to their cen&s;ures. Tho&s;e by whom
I wi&s;h to be judged, will I hope, approve
of my adding dignity to Cor&s;ica, by &s;hew|ing
its con&s;ideration among the ancients,
and will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to find my page
&s;ometimes embelli&s;hed with a &s;ea&s;onable
quotation from the Cla&s;&s;icks. The tran&s;|lations
are a&s;cribed to their proper au|thours.
What are not &s;o a&s;cribed are my
own.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething
in defence of my orthography. Of late
it has become the fa&s;hion to render our
language more neat and trim by leaving
out k after c, and u in the la&s;t &s;yllable of
words which u&s;ed to end in our. The il|lu&s;trious
Mr. Samuel John&s;on, who has a|lone
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24">
executed in England what was the
task of whole academies in other countries,
has been careful in his Dictionary to pre|&s;erve
the k as a mark of Saxon original.
He has for mo&s;t part too, been careful to
pre&s;erve the u, but he has al&s;o omitted it
in &s;everal words. I have retained the k,
and have taken upon me to follow a ge|neral
rule with regard to words ending
in our. Wherever a word originally Latin
has been tran&s;mitted to us through the
medium of the French, I have written it
with the characteri&s;tical u. An attention
to this may appear trivial. But I own I
am one of tho&s;e who are curious in the
formation of language in its various
modes; and therefore wi&s;h that the affi|nity
of Engli&s;h with other tongues may
not be forgotten. If this work &s;hould at
any future period be reprinted, I hope
that care will be taken of my orthogra|phy.</P>
<P>He who publi&s;hes a book, affecting
not to be an authour, and profe&s;&s;ing an
indifference for literary fame, may po&s;|&s;ibly
<PB N="xxiv" REF="25">
impo&s;e upon many people &s;uch an
idea of his con&s;equence as he wi&s;hes
may be received. For my part, I &s;hould
be proud to be known as an authour;
and I have an ardent ambition for litera|ry
fame; for of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions I &s;hould ima|gine
literary fame to be the mo&s;t valuable.
A man who has been able to furni&s;h a
book which has been approved by the
world, has e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf as a re|&s;pectable
character in di&s;tant &s;ociety, with|out
any danger of having that character
le&s;&s;ened by the ob&s;ervation of his weak|ne&s;&s;es.
To pre&s;erve an uniform dignity
among tho&s;e who &s;ee us every day, is
hardly po&s;&s;ible; and to aim at it, mu&s;t
put us under the fetters of a perpetual
re&s;traint. The authour of an approved
book may allow his natural di&s;po&s;ition
an ea&s;y play, and yet indulge the pride
of &s;uperiour genius when he con&s;iders
that by tho&s;e who know him only
as an authour, he never cea&s;es to be re|&s;pected.
Such an authour when in his
hours of gloom and di&s;content, may have
<PB N="xxv" REF="26">
the con&s;olation to think that his writings
are at that very time giving plea&s;ure to
numbers; and &s;uch an authour may che|ri&s;h
the hope of being remembered after
death, which has been a great object to
the noble&s;t minds in all ages.</P>
<P>Whether I may merit any portion of
literary fame, the publick will judge.
Whatever my ambition may be, I tru&s;t
that my confidence is not too great, nor
my hopes too &s;anguine.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE
To the Third Edition.</HEAD>
<P>I Now beg leave to pre&s;ent the world with
a more correct edition of my Account
of Cor&s;ica. I return my &s;incere thanks to
tho&s;e who have taken the trouble to point
out &s;everal faults, with a &s;pirit of candid
critici&s;m. I hope they will not be offend|ed
that in one or two places I have pre|&s;erved
my own reading, contrary to their
opinion; as I never would own that I am
wrong, till I am convinced that it is &s;o.
My orthography I have &s;ufficiently ex|plained;
and although &s;ome plea&s;antry has
been &s;hewn, I have not met with one ar|gument
again&s;t it.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to Mr. Burnaby, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that the erroneous tran&s;lation of a
pa&s;&s;age in Livy, which is corrected in this
edition, page 64, was mine; it being no
<PB N="xxviii" REF="28">
part of his Journal, in which the original
text only was quoted. In comparing the
former editions with this, it will appear
that my fir&s;t tran&s;lation renders the mean|ing
of Livy, but does not convey the turn
of expre&s;&s;ion, as I hope I have now done.</P>
<P>While I have a proper &s;en&s;e of my obli|gations
to tho&s;e who have treated me with
candour, I do not forget that there have
been others who have cho&s;en to treat me
in an illiberal manner. The re&s;entment
of &s;ome has evidently ari&s;en from the
grateful admiration which I have expre&s;&s;ed
of Mr. Samuel John&s;on. Over &s;uch, it is
a triumph to me, to a&s;&s;ure them, that I ne|ver
cea&s;e to think of Mr. John&s;on, with the
&s;ame warmth of affection, and the &s;ame
dignity of veneration. The re&s;entment of
others it is more difficult to explain. For
what &s;hould make men attack one who
never offended them, who has done his
be&s;t to entertain them, and who is enga|ged
in the mo&s;t generous cau&s;e? But I am
told by tho&s;e who have gone before me in

<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
OF CORSICA.
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY is &s;o natural, and &s;o dear to
mankind, whether as individuals, or as
members of &s;ociety, that it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to our happine&s;s. Every thing great and
worthy ari&s;eth from it. Liberty gives health to
the mind, and enables us to enjoy the full exer|ci&s;e
of our faculties. He who is in chains cannot
move either ea&s;ily or gracefully; nothing elegant
or noble can be expected from tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;pi|rits
are &s;ubdued by tyranny, and who&s;e powers
are cramped by re&s;traint.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, who from the darke&s;t pre|judice,
or mo&s;t corrupt venality, would endeavour
<PB N="34" REF="34">
to rea&s;on mankind out of their original and ge|nuine
feelings, and per&s;uade them to &s;ub&s;titute ar|tificial
&s;entiment in place of that which is implant+ed
by GOD and Nature. They would maintain,
that &s;lavery will from habit become ea&s;y, and, that
mankind are truly better, when under confine|ment
and &s;ubjection to the arbitrary will of a few.</P>
<P>Such doctrine at this, could never have gained
any ground, had it been addre&s;&s;ed to calm rea|&s;on
alone. Its parti&s;ans therefore have found it
nece&s;&s;ary to addre&s;s them&s;elves to the imagina|tion
and pa&s;&s;ions; to call in the aid of enthu&s;i|a&s;m
and &s;uper&s;tition; in &s;ome countries to in&s;till
a &s;trange love and attachment to their &s;overeigns;
and in others to propogate certain my&s;tical noti|ons,
which the mind of man is wonderfully rea|dy
to receive, of a divine right to rule; as if their
&s;overeigns had de&s;cended from heaven. This la&s;t
idea has been cheri&s;hed for ages, from the &startq;Cara
De&ucirc;m &s;oboles, The beloved offspring of the
Gods,&endq; among the Romans, to tho&s;e various ele|vated
and endearing epithets, which modern na|tions
have thought proper to be&s;tow upon their
&s;overeigns.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;ophi&s;ms may be devi&s;ed in fa|vour
of &s;lavery, patience under it, can never be
any thing but &startq;the effect of a &s;ickly con&s;titution,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
which creates a lazine&s;s and de&s;pondency, that
puts men beyond hopes and fears: mortifying
ambition, and other active qualities, which
freedom begets; and in&s;tead of them, affording
only a dull kind of plea&s;ure, of being carele&s;s
and in&s;en&s;ible<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">My lord Mole&s;worth's Account of Denmark, p. 69.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but by entering into &s;ocie|ty,
mankind voluntarily give up a part of their
natural rights, and bind them&s;elves to the obe|dience
of laws, calculated for the general good.
But, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between authority, and
oppre&s;&s;ion; between laws, and capricious dic|tates;
and keeping the original intention of go|vernment
ever in view, we &s;hould take care that
no more re&s;traint be laid upon natural liberty,
than what the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety require.</P>
<P>Perhaps the limits between the power of go|vernment,
and the liberty of the people, &s;hould
not be too &s;trictly marked out. Men of ta&s;te rec|kon
that picture hard, where the outlines are &s;o
&s;trong, as to be clearly &s;een. They admire a piece
of painting, where the colours are delicately blend|ed,
and the tints, which point out every particu|lar
object, are &s;oftened into each other, by an in|&s;en&s;ible
gradation. So in a virtuous &s;tate, there
&s;hould be &s;uch a mutual confidence between the
<PB N="36" REF="36">
government and the people, that the rights of
each &s;hould not be expre&s;sly defined.</P>
<P>But flagrant inju&s;tice, on one &s;ide or other,
is not to be concealed; and, without que&s;tion, it
is the privilege of the &s;ide that is injured, to vin|dicate
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections from a
con&s;ideration of the arguments by which ingeni|ous
men in the refinement of politicks have en|deavoured
to amu&s;e mankind, and turn away
their attention from the plain and &s;imple notions
of liberty.</P>
<P>Liberty is indeed the parent of felicity, of eve|ry
noble virtue, and even of every art and &s;cience.
Whatever vain attempts have been made to rai&s;e
the generous plants under an oppre&s;&s;ive climate,
have only &s;hewn more evidently the value of
freedom.</P>
<P>It is therefore no wonder that the world has
at all times been rou&s;ed at the mention of liber|ty;
and that we read with admiration and a vir|tuous
enthu&s;ia&s;m, the gallant achievements of
tho&s;e who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the
glorious cau&s;e, and the hi&s;tory of &s;tates who were
animated with the principle of freedom, and made
it the ba&s;is of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="37">
Should any one tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the an|nals
of an en&s;laved nation, we &s;hould &s;leep over
whole ages of the humbling detail. Every thing
would be &s;o poor, &s;o tame, and &s;o abject, that
one might as well peru&s;e the records of a pri&s;on-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But we have a manly &s;atisfaction in reading
the hi&s;tory of the ancient Romans; even ab&s;tract|ing
from their connections and their broils with
other &s;tates. Their internal progre&s;s alone af|fords
ample matter of &s;peculation to a judicious
and &s;pirited ob&s;erver of human nature. We love
to trace the various &s;prings of their conduct, and
of their advancement in civilization. We con|template
with plea&s;ure the ferments between the
patricians and plebeians, the &s;trong exertions of
rude genius, the vigorous exerci&s;es and hardy
virtues of men uncontrouled by timid &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>They who entertain an extravagant veneration
for antiquity, would make us believe, that the
divine fire of liberty has been long ago exhau&s;ted,
and that any appearances of it which are to be
found in modern times, are but feeble and dim.
They would make us believe that the world is
grown old, that the &s;trength of human nature is
decayed, and that we are no more to expect tho&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="38">
noble powers which dignified men in former
ages.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that human nature is the &s;ame
at all times, and appears in different lights merely
from a difference of circum&s;tances. In the lan|guage
of the &s;choolmen, the &s;ub&s;tance is fixed,
the accidents only vary. Rome has yet the &s;even
hills on which the conquerors of the world dwelt,
and the&s;e are inhabited by Romans. Athens
&s;till occupies the &s;pace from whence philo&s;ophy
and genius diffu&s;ed a radiance to all the nations
around, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Athenians. But
neither of the&s;e people now retain any re&s;em|blance
of their illu&s;trious ance&s;tors; this is entire|ly
owing to the cour&s;e of political events, which
has produced a total change in their manners.</P>
<P>That the &s;pirit of liberty has flouri&s;hed in mo|dern
times, we may appeal to the hi&s;tories of the
Swi&s;s, and of the Dutch; and the bolde&s;t proofs
of it are to be found in the annals of our own
country.</P>
<P>But a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed example of it actually
exi&s;ts in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica. There, a brave and
re&s;olute nation, has now for upwards of &s;ix and
thirty years, maintained a con&s;tant &s;truggle again&s;t
the oppre&s;&s;ion of the republick of Genoa. The&s;e
valiant i&s;landers were for a long time looked upon
<PB N="39" REF="39">
as an incon&s;iderable band of malecontents, as a
di&s;orderly troop of rebels, who would &s;peedily be
compelled to re&s;ume tho&s;e chains which they had
frowardly &s;haken off. They have however con|tinued
&s;teady to their purpo&s;e. Providence has
favoured them; and Europe now turns her eyes
upon them, and with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;ecs them on
the eve of emancipating them&s;elves for ever from
a foreign yoke, and becoming a free and inde|pendent
people.</P>

<Q><L>When a long age of vent'rous toil was pa&s;t,</L>

<P>The &s;mallne&s;s of the Cor&s;ican &s;tate does not
render it le&s;s an object of admiration. On the
contrary, we ought to admire it the more. The
ingenious Mr. Hume<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the populou&s;ne&s;s of ancient nations.</NOTE> hath &s;hewn us, that
Rhodes, Thebes, and many of the famous an|cient
&s;tates were not &s;o numerous as the people of
Cor&s;ica now are. If the ten thou&s;and Greeks have
gained immortal honour, becau&s;e they were op|po&s;ed
to the armies of the Per&s;ian monarch, Shall
not the Cor&s;icans be found de&s;erving of glory,
who have &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t a republick, which
<PB N="40" REF="40">
has been aided at different times by the power of
France, and by that of the empire of Germany?</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans have been obliged to &s;hew par|ticular
force of &s;pirit. The Swi&s;s and the Dutch
were both a&s;&s;i&s;ted by powerful nations in the re|covery
of their liberties: but during the long and
bloody war which Cor&s;ica has carried on, the Pow|ers
of Europe, who might be &s;uppo&s;ed friendly to
her, have &s;tood aloof, and &s;he has &s;ingle and un|&s;upported,
weathered the &s;torm, and arrived at
the degree of con&s;equence which &s;he now holds.</P>
<P>To give an account of this i&s;land, is what I
am now to attempt. The attempt is &s;urely lau|dable;
and I am per&s;uaded that my readers will
grant me every indulgence, when they con&s;ider
how favourable is the &s;ubject. They will con&s;i|der
that I am the fir&s;t Briton who has had the
curio&s;ity to vi&s;it Cor&s;ica, and to receive &s;uch infor|mation
as to enable him to form a ju&s;t idea of it;
and they will readily make allowance for the en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of one who has been among the brave
i&s;landers, when their patriotick virtue is at its
height, and who has felt as it were a communi|cation
of their &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The plan which I have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf
is, to give a Geographical and Phy&s;ical de&s;cription
of the i&s;land, that my readers may be made ac|quainted
<PB N="41" REF="41">
with the country which in the&s;e latter
days has produced &s;o heroick a race of patriots.
To exhibit a conci&s;e view of the Revolutions it
has undergone from the earlie&s;t times, which will
prepare the mind, and throw light on the &s;equel.
To &s;hew the Pre&s;ent State of Cor&s;ica; and to &s;ub|join
my Journal of a Tour to that i&s;land, in
which I relate a variety of anecdotes, and trea&s;ure
up many memoirs of the illu&s;trious General of the
Cor&s;icans&mdash;MEMORABILIA PAOLI.</P>
<P>I do mo&s;t &s;incerely declare, that I feel my&s;elf
inferiour to the ta&s;k. But I hope the &s;ketch which
I give, will be of &s;ome immediate &s;ervice, and will
induce others to execute a more perfect plan. I
&s;hall be happy if I contribute in a certain degree
to give the world a ju&s;t idea of Cor&s;ica, and to in|tere&s;t
the generous in its favour; and I would adopt
for this work a &s;imple and beautiful in&s;cription on
the front of the Palazzo Tolomei at Siena,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Situation, Extent, Air, Soil, and Pro|ductions,
of CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>CORSICA is an i&s;land of the Mediterranean
&s;ea, &s;ituated between the 41 and 43 de|gree
of north latitude, and between the 8 and 10
degree of ea&s;t longitude, reckoning from London.
It hath on the north the Ligurian &s;ea, and gulf
of Genoa. On the ea&s;t, the Tu&s;can &s;ea; on the
&s;outh, a &s;trait of ten miles which &s;eparates it from
Sardinia; and on the we&s;t the Mediterranean. It
is about 100 miles &s;outh of Genoa, and 80
&s;outh-we&s;t of Leghorn, from whence it can plain|ly
be &s;een when the weather is clear. It is 150
miles in length, and from 40 to 50 in breadth,
being broade&s;t about the middle. It is reckoned
322 miles in circumference; but an exact mea|&s;urement
round it would extend to 500 miles,
as it is edged with many promontories, and with
a variety of bays.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
Pliny the elder hath given us a &s;hort, but very
accurate account of the geography of Cor&s;ica;
&startq;In Ligu&s;tico mari e&s;t Cor&s;ica quam Graeci Cyr|non
appellavere, &s;ed Thu&s;co proprior, a &s;epten|trione
in meridiem projecta, longa pa&s;&s;uum CL
millia, lata majore ex parte L, circuitu CCCXXII,
civitates habet XXXIII et colonias Marianam a
Mario deductam, Aleriam a dictatore Sylla<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hi&s;t. lib. ii. cap. 6.</NOTE>.
In the Ligurian &s;ea, but nearer to Tu&s;cany than
to Liguria, is Cor&s;ica, which the Greeks called
Cyrnus. It extendeth from north to &s;outh, and
is about 150 miles in length, for the mo&s;t part
50 in breadth, and 322 in circumference. It
hath 33 &s;tates and two colonies, Mariana found|ed
by Marius, and Aleria founded by the dicta|tor
Sylla.&endq; Of the&s;e 33 &s;tates, not above five
or &s;ix can now be traced; and the colonies are
only to be marked by their ruins. But the u&s;ual
fidelity of Pliny is to be credited in this account.
Pomponius Mela<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pomp. Mel. lib. ii. cap. 7.</NOTE> de&s;cribes the &s;ituation of
Cor&s;ica, as does Ptolemy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ptol. Geog. lib. iii. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Seneca the philo&s;opher hath left us two mo&s;t
horrid pictures of Cor&s;ica, very fal&s;e indeed, but
executed with uncommon &s;trength of fancy and
expre&s;&s;ion. Stoick as he was, of a grave and &s;e|vere
<PB N="45" REF="44">
demeanour, he did not e&s;cape the Emperour's
jealou&s;y, but being accu&s;ed as one of the many
gallants with whom the profligate Julia had been
guilty of adultery, he was bani&s;hed to Cor&s;ica,
where he remained for &s;even years; and where
in the province of Capo Cor&s;o they &s;till &s;hew an
old ruin called &startq;Il torre di Seneca, Seneca's Tower.&endq;
Here he compo&s;ed his books De Con&s;olatione to
Polybius, and to his mother Helvia, with &s;everal
other works; and here he indulged his fretted
imagination in the following epigrams.</P>

more than one would expect under &s;o warm a &s;un.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica has indeed been pretty generally re|pre&s;ented
as unwhole&s;ome, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, has
been owing to the bad report given of it by the
Romans, who e&s;tabli&s;hed their colonies at Aleria
and Mariana, which from their damp &s;ituation,
occa&s;ioned a great death among the inhabitants,
and accordingly the&s;e colonies &s;oon went to ruin.
But all the interiour parts of the I&s;land have very
good air.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica is remarkably well furni&s;hed with good
harbours, &s;o that we may apply to it what Florus
&s;ays of the Campania, &startq;Nihil ho&s;pitalius mari<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Flor. Lib. i. Cap. 16.</NOTE>.
Nothing more ho&s;pitable to the &s;ea.&endq; It has on

I&s;ola Ro&s;&s;a, Calvi, Ajaccio. On the South it has
Bonifaccio. And on the ea&s;t Porto Vecchio, Ba|&s;tia,
and Macinajo. Of each of the&s;e I &s;hall give
&s;ome account.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">
Centuri, though at pre&s;ent but a &s;mall harbour,
may be greatly enlarged, as its &s;ituation is very
convenient.</P>
<P>San Fiorenzo is an exten&s;ive gulf. It runs
about fifteen miles up into the country, and is
about five miles acro&s;s, and many fathom deep.
The gulf it&s;elf hath often a violent &s;urge, being
expo&s;ed to the we&s;terly winds; but there are &s;eve|$al
creeks and bays, particularly on the &s;outh
&s;ide of it, which are quite &s;ecure. There is a
bay under the tower of Fornali, about two miles
from San Fiorenzo, which is highly e&s;teemed,
and where ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burden may be
&s;afely &s;tationed.</P>
<P>I&s;ola Ro&s;&s;a is but a little harbour; but has a
con&s;iderable depth of water, and is defended by
a &s;mall i&s;land again&s;t the we&s;terly winds. They
talk of erecting a mole to lock it in on every quar|ter.

The only objection I ever heard made to it, was
by a French Gentleman, who told me, that the
bottom of it was full of &s;harp rocks, which were
apt to cut the cables of &s;hips which entered it:
and he in&s;tanced one of the tran&s;ports, which had
landed &s;ome of the French troops in the year
1764. He however was under a mi&s;take; for
I have been at pains to enquire very particularly
concerning this, and am informed from the be&s;t
authority, that there is nothing to fear from
rocks at Calvi, and that the French tran&s;port
which &s;uffered a little there, happened to be run
foul of, by &s;ome of the re&s;t, which was the oc|ca&s;ion
of any damage it &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Ajaccio is a wide and commodious harbour,
with a good mole, and perfectly &s;afe. It wants
only to have a &s;mall rock in front of the mole
removed, which might be done at no great
charge.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica hath al&s;o in this quarter &s;everal &s;maller
havens, which are u&s;eful for the reception of
little ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50">
Bonifaccio is an u&s;eful harbour, much fre|quented
&s;ince the olde&s;t times, and very fit for
trade.</P>
<P>Ba&s;tia is not a port of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, as
&s;hips of war cannot enter it. But it hath a mole
for the convenience of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, for which it
is very well fitted. The i&s;lands of Gorgona,
Capraja, and Ilva, or the Elbe, are placed at no
great di&s;tance in the &s;ea which rolls between the
ea&s;t coa&s;t of Cor&s;ica and Tu&s;cany, with the Pope's
dominions; &s;o that &s;mall ve&s;&s;els can never be at
a lo&s;s for protection, &s;hould any &s;udden &s;torm
come upon them, as they can run into any of
the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Macinajo is not one of the principal harbours
in Cor&s;ica, though it is very &s;afe and commo|dious
for ve&s;&s;els of a light con&s;truction. I men|tion
Macinajo, becau&s;e it was from thence that
the expedition &s;et &s;ail again&s;t Capraja, as will be

<P>Diodorus Siculus celebrates Cor&s;ica for the ex|cellency

<PB N="52" REF="51">
This, which was anciently called the
Syracu&s;ian, has now the name of Porto Vecchio;
of which it is proper to take particular notice.</P>
<P>Porto Vecchio is a &s;pacious haven, capable of
containing a very large fleet. It is five moles long,
above a mile and a half broad, has a great depth
of water, and a good bottom, and being land|locked
on every &s;ide, is well &s;heltered from
&s;torms. I may add, that nature has placed a high
and rocky mountain like a &s;tately column to point
it out at a great di&s;tance. In &s;hort, Porto Vec|chio
may vie with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed harbours
in Europe.</P>
<P>The only objection to it, is the badne&s;s of its
air, occa&s;ioned by the mar&s;hy grounds which lie
in its neighbourhood. But this di&s;advantage may
be remedied, as has been done at Leghorn.
&startq;The country about Leghorn was formerly a vile
mora&s;s or rather quagmire, the noxious &s;teams
of which rendered the air unwhole&s;ome; but
by the &s;kill and pains of an Engli&s;hman, Sir
Robert Dudley, &s;on to Queen Elizabeth's po|tent
favourite the Earl of Leice&s;ter, the &s;oil

and the port improved, &s;o as to

<P><PB N="53" REF="52">
From this account of the harbours of Cor&s;ica,
it will appear of how great con&s;equence an alliance
with this i&s;land might be to any of the maritime
powers of Europe. For, a fleet &s;tationed there
might command the navigation of Genoa, Tu&s;|cany,
and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, that between
Spain and Naples, and a good &s;hare of that to the
Levant; not to mention its influence over that of
Sardinia. And it may be material to ob&s;erve, that
ve&s;&s;els &s;tationed in the ports of Cor&s;ica might be
formidable to France, as the we&s;tern &s;ide of the
i&s;land is directly oppo&s;ite to the exten&s;ive coa&s;t of
Provence, on which a de&s;cent might be made with
crui&s;ers in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The northern point of Cor&s;ica, called Capo
Cor&s;o<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">There is a place in Guinea, which has al&s;o the name of Capo Cor&s;o: I know not from what. Cluver. Geog. p. 537.</NOTE>, is about 30 miles long, very mountain|ous
and rocky, but covered with vines and olives.</P>
<P>There are, in &s;everal parts of the i&s;land, but
particularly in Capo Cor&s;o, a great many ancient
towers, built about three or four hundred years
ago, to defend the inhabitants again&s;t the incur&s;i|ons
of the Turks and other pirates. There is there
a little village called Tomino, &s;trong by &s;ituation.
<PB N="54" REF="53">
The Genoe&s;e have made &s;everal attacks upon it
during the late troubles, but were never able to
carry it. The inhabitants are very de&s;ervedly proud
of this. They &s;hew, with particular triumph, a
&s;hell which the enemy threw into their village, to
oblige them to &s;urrender. They have placed it
in a niche on the out&s;ide of their church, to &s;erve
as a memorial of their deliverance, and to in&s;pire
them with greater zeal and devotion when they go
to divine wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>From Tomino ea&s;t to Ba&s;tia, is about 26 miles
of a country much diver&s;ified with hills, and
abounding in &s;prings. On the coa&s;t are a number
of poor fi&s;hing towns, and a little up the country,
there are &s;everal villages or hamlets prettily
&s;ituated.</P>
<P>Ba&s;tia has of a long time been reckoned the
capital of Cor&s;ica. It was here that the Genoe&s;e
held the &s;eat of their &s;overeign power: and indeed
Ba&s;tia is &s;till the large&s;t town in the i&s;land. It has
a &s;tately appearance from the &s;ea, being built on
the declivity of a hill; though upon entering the
town, one is a good deal di&s;appointed; for the
hou&s;es are in general ill built, and the &s;treets nar|row,
and from the &s;ituation of the town, are ne|ce&s;&s;arily
very &s;teep. There are however &s;everal
pretty good buildings here. It hath a ca&s;tle, which
<PB N="55" REF="54">
commands the town and harbour, which, though
but a &s;orry fortification at pre&s;ent, is capable of
being made a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength, as it
hath a range of hills behind it, on which little re|doubts
might be erected; and with the&s;e, and a
few &s;ub&s;tantial outworks towards the &s;ea, it might
&s;tand a pretty long &s;iege. The ca&s;tle is properly
on a &s;eparate territory, called TERRA NUOVA, the
New Land, as is al&s;o the cathedral of Ba&s;tia,
which has nothing very remarkable. It belongs
to the bi&s;hoprick of Mariana.</P>
<P>The church of St. John in this city, by no
means an inelegant building, belongs to the Je|&s;uits,
who have here a college. Their garden is
finely &s;ituated, large, and well laid out. This they
owe in a great mea&s;ure to the French, who have
been &s;tationed in Cor&s;ica at different times. From
them the inhabitants have learned much of what
they know of the arts and conveniences of life.
There is here a convent of Lazari&s;ts or mi&s;&s;iona|ries,
a va&s;t and magnificent hou&s;e, almo&s;t over|hanging
the &s;ea. The convent of the Franci&s;cans,
and that of the Capuchins, are &s;ituated on the
ri&s;ing grounds behind Ba&s;tia. The la&s;t &s;tands in
a beautiful expo&s;ure, and has really a very pretty
front.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="55">
From Ba&s;tia &s;outh to beyond Aleria, is one
continued plain, between 50 and 60 miles in
length, proper for rai&s;ing all &s;orts of grain, as well
as for pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of the ruins of Mariana and A|leria,
the two Roman colonies which &s;tood on
this plain; for as Cor&s;ica was much di&s;regarded
by the Romans, they did not think it worthy of
having any of their ta&s;te and magnificence em|ployed
in it: &s;o there are no ve&s;tiges of ancient
grandeur. As however, even the dregs of the
Romans could not be without &s;ome &s;kill in the
arts, &s;everal antiques, &s;uch as rings, and &s;eals with
engravings on precious &s;tones have been found
here, and &s;ometimes pretty good ones. The ruins
of an old town called Nicea, &s;aid to be built by
the Etru&s;cans, are &s;till to be &s;een on this plain,
but without any thing remarkable.</P>
<P>Beyond Aleria the country ri&s;es into &s;mall hills,
proper for vines, olives, mulberry trees, and many
of them for corn. It is traver&s;ed by &s;ome ridges
of mountains, upon which, not far from Porto
Vecchio, are great numbers of very fine oaks, the
be&s;t being to be found here, and at Campoloro.
A rich waved country with &s;ome few interrupti|ons,
reaches along the ea&s;t and &s;outh coa&s;ts to
Bonifaccio, which is a pretty con&s;iderable town,
<PB N="57" REF="56">
well inhabited, and &s;trongly fortified; and from
thence is continued to the plain of Ajaccio.</P>
<P>Ajaccio is the prettie&s;t town in Cor&s;ica. It
hath many very hand&s;ome &s;treets, and beautiful
walks; a citadel, and a palace for the Genoe&s;e go|vernour.
The inhabitants of this town are the
genteele&s;t people in the i&s;land, having had a good
deal of intercour&s;e with the French. In Ajaccio
are the remains of a colony of Greeks &s;ettled in
Cor&s;ica, of which colony a particular account
&s;hall be given in the next chapter.</P>
<P>From the plain of Ajaccio, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome
more ridges, you advance along the we&s;t &s;hore to
the provinces of Balagna and Nebbio, which are
very rich, and afford an agreeable pro&s;pect, parti|cularly
Balagna, which may be called the garden
of Cor&s;ica, being highly favoured by nature, and
having al&s;o had in a &s;uperiour degree the advan|tages
of cultivation.</P>
<P>You next arrive at San Fiorenzo, which is but
an incon&s;iderable place, and of no great &s;trength.
About a quarter of a mile to the &s;outhward of the
town, are &s;ome low mar&s;hy grounds, which make
San Fiorenzo &s;o &s;ickly, that few people choo&s;e
to inhabit it, and the garri&s;on there mu&s;t be chang|ed
every month.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">
On the northern &s;hore of the gulf, are two or
three villages, of which the principal is Nonza.
This is properly the key of Capo Cor&s;o; becau&s;e
from the cape into the interiour parts of the i&s;land
on the we&s;tern &s;ide, there is only one pa&s;s, and that
leads through this place. Nonza is a little village,
on a high rock, on the extreme pinnacle of which,
&s;ome hundred fathoms above the gulf, and di|rectly
perpendicular, &s;tands a tower of &s;mall for|tre&s;s,
which commands the avenue to it. Nonza
is literally what Cicero calls Ithaca, &startq;In a&s;perri|mis

on the rude&s;t cliffs like a little ne&s;t.&endq; After this,
the cape begins, which fini&s;hes at Er&s;a.</P>
<P>I have thus reviewed the Cor&s;ican harbours, and
travelled round the &s;kirts of the country, along its
&s;hores.</P>
<P>Diodorus Siculus de&s;cribes Cor&s;ica as an exten|&s;ive
i&s;land, very mountainous, abounding in large
fore&s;ts, and watered with many rivulets: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diodor. Sicul. lib. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">
Indeed the interiour parts of the i&s;land are in
general mountainous, though inter&s;per&s;ed with
fruitful valleys; but have a peculiar grand appear|ance,
and in&s;pire one with the genius of the place;
with that undaunted and inflexible &s;pirit, which
will not bow to oppre&s;&s;ion. As Homer &s;ays of

<P>The great divi&s;ion of Cor&s;ica, is into the DI
QUA, and the DI LA DEI MONTI, The country
on this &s;ide, and the country on the other &s;ide of
the mountains; reckoning from Ba&s;tia. By the
mountains is under&s;tood, that great range of them
which ri&s;es beyond Aleria, and &s;tretches acro&s;s
the i&s;land, inter&s;ecting it however by no means
equally; for, the country DI QUA is a third more
than that DI LA. Another old divi&s;ion of this
i&s;land was, to &s;uppo&s;e a line drawn from Porto
Vecchio, to the gulf of San Fiorenzo; and the
divi&s;ion upon the ea&s;t, was called BANDA DI
DENTRO, The &s;ide within; and that on the we&s;t,
was called BANDA DI FUORI, The &s;ide without. I
never could learn the meaning of this divi&s;ion
farther, than that, I &s;uppo&s;e, tho&s;e who inhabited
<PB N="60" REF="59">
Ba&s;tia and the plain of Aleria, looked upon them|&s;elves
as the mo&s;t civilized; and &s;o were for calling
tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land to them
&startq;forre&s;tieri, foreigners.&endq;</P>
<P>The next divi&s;ion is into provinces, of which
there are nine; for althoug a great part of this
country long went under the denomination of
&startq;FEUDOS, feus,&endq; and is &s;till called &s;o in maps,
the juri&s;diction of the &s;ignors is now gradually
wearing out, and will &s;oon be &s;unk into the gene|ral
power of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Another divi&s;ion of Cor&s;ica is into PIEVES. A
Pieve is properly an eccle&s;ia&s;tical appointment,
containing a certain number of pari&s;hes, over
which is placed a PIEVANO, who &s;uperintends the
the prie&s;ts, and draws a certain part of the tithes.
But this divi&s;ion is as much u&s;ed for civil affairs,
as for tho&s;e of the church.</P>
<P>There are large tracts of uninhabited land in
Cor&s;ica, mo&s;tly covered with woods; to &s;ome
parts of which the pea&s;ants re&s;ort in &s;ummer to
feed their cattle, and to gather che&s;tnuts, mak|ing
little &s;heds for them&s;elves to lie under. There
is hardly &s;uch a thing as a detached farm-hou&s;e
to be &s;een in the i&s;land, like what are &s;cattered
every where over Great Britain; for, the Cor&s;i|cans
gather together in little villages, which they
<PB N="61" REF="60">
call by corruption &startq;PAESES, countries.&endq; I re|member
when I was fir&s;t told in Cor&s;ica, that I
&s;hould travel a great miles &startq;Senza veder
un pae&s;e, Without &s;eeing a country,&endq; I could
not conceive what they meant. The Cor&s;icans
are in greater &s;afety, and have more &s;ociety with
each other by thus living in villages; which is
much the cu&s;tom in the cantons of Switzerland,
and &s;ome parts of Germany; as it was anciently
among all nations.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican villages are frequently built up|on
the very &s;ummits of their mountains, on crag|gy
cliffs of &s;o &s;tupendous a height, that the
hou&s;es can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed during the
day; but at night, when the &s;hepherds kindle
their fires, the reflection of &s;uch a variety
of lights, makes the&s;e aerial villages have a
mo&s;t picture&s;que and plea&s;ing appearance.</P>
<P>In the center of the i&s;lands Corte, which
is properly its capital, and will undoubtedly be
one day a city of eminence. Here is the Gene|ral's
palace; and here is the &s;upreme &s;eat of ju&s;|tice,
where the executive power con&s;tantly re&s;ides,
and where the legi&s;lature is annually a&s;&s;embled;
and here al&s;o is the univer&s;ity, which in time may
become a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;eat of learning, though I
mu&s;t not allow my enthu&s;ia&s;m to indulge it&s;elf in
<PB N="62" REF="61">
too eager hopes of &s;eeing Cor&s;ica an Athens, as
well as a Thebes.</P>
<P>Corte is &s;ituated part at the foot, and part on
the declivity of a rock, in a plain &s;urrounded with
prodigious high mountains, and at the conflux of
two rivers, the Tavignano and Re&s;tonica. It
hath a great deal of rich country about it, and a
wonderful natural &s;trength, being hemmed in by
almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains and narrow defiles,
which may be defended with a handful of men,
again&s;t very large armies.</P>
<P>Upon a point of the rock, prominent above

<P>In the plain, on the north of Corte, there is
a convent of Capuchins, and on the &s;ide of the
hill, to the &s;outh of the City, there is a convent

palace was repairing; and here all &s;trangers of re|&s;pect

from its an&s;wering probably the &s;ame pur|po&s;e

Cadmaea of the Thebans, or Lari&s;&s;a of the

name of the citadel. Upon this hill is a tem|ple

the plainer and more open avenues; Locis

<P>Cor&s;ica is extremely well watered. Its princi|pal
lakes, are tho&s;e of Ino and Crena, about two
miles from each other; both &s;ituated on the high|e&s;t
mountain in the i&s;land, called by the ancients
Mons Aureus, and now Gradaccio or Monte Ro|tondo.
It is of an amazing height, and may
equal any of the Alps. From the top of it there
<PB N="66" REF="65">
is a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view of all Cor&s;ica, of the
&s;eas and of Sardinia, with di&s;tant pro&s;pects of
Italy and France; while the Mediterranean and
many of its little i&s;les are al&s;o under the eye. But
people &s;eldom go to take this view; for the up|per
part of the monntain is almo&s;t a perpendicular
rock, &s;o that a man mu&s;t climb two miles with
the help of his hands and knees; and for the
greate&s;t part of the year, this immen&s;e mountain
is covered with &s;now. The&s;e two lakes of Ino
and Crena, are both of con&s;iderable exte$t.</P>
<P>In the plain of Aleria, near to Mariana, is a
lake called Chiurlina or Biguglia, which is pretty
large, and communicates with the &s;ea; and near
to Aleria, is a lake called Il Stagno di Diana,
which al&s;o communicates with the &s;ea; and it is
remarkable, that in &s;ummer, when the heat of
the &s;un has exhaled part of the water, and the
re&s;t of it is ab&s;orbed by the &s;andy bottom, there
remains a kind of natural &s;alt, which the Cor|&s;icans
find very good, and con&s;tantly make
u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The rivers of Cor&s;ica are, the Golo, a large
and beautiful river, which takes its ri&s;e from the
lake of Ino, traver&s;es &s;everal provinces, and after
a cour&s;e of above &s;eventy miles, empties it&s;elf in|to
the &s;ea, ju&s;t by the ancient city of Mariana.
<PB N="67" REF="66">
The Tavignano, al&s;o a con&s;iderable river, which
takes its ri&s;e from the lake of Crena, and after
traver&s;ing a long tract of rude country, empties
it&s;elf into the &s;ea, ju&s;t by the ancient city of Ale|ria.
The Re&s;tonica, which, though but a &s;mall
river, is famous in Corfica, on account of its par|ticular
qualities. Its water is clear as chry&s;tal,
and mo&s;t agreeable to drink; &s;o that Seneca cer|tainly
never &s;aw the Re&s;tonica, otherwi&s;e he
would never have &s;aid, that Cor&s;ica had not
&startq;hau&s;tus aquae, a draught of water.&endq; The Re|&s;tonica
is &s;aid to be of a mineral nature, and very
whole&s;ome. It hath a virtue of whitening every
thing. The &s;tones in its channel are like as ma|ny
pieces of chalk. I remember on the road be|tween
Rome and Naples, a run from a &s;ulphure|ous
&s;pring, which had &s;omething of the &s;ame qua|lity,
only it did not give &s;o very white a tincture
as that of the Re&s;tonica, which will make iron
look almo&s;t like &s;ilver, and never ru&s;t. The
Cor&s;icans frequently dip the barrels and locks of
their guns in it.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other rivers, of which I &s;hall
not give a particular de&s;cription; the Prunella,
Fiumorbo, Gravonne, Valinco, Talavo, Lia|mone;
fine poetical names. There are al&s;o a
<PB N="68" REF="67">
great many rivulets, which &s;erve to enrich the
country, and keep it con&s;tantly fre&s;h.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, that with proper care and
expence, &s;ome of the Cor&s;ican rivers might be
rendered navigable; but this, I think, would
be a very idle project; for their cour&s;es are
exceedingly rapid, and when there has been
a great deal of rain, the torrents which
tumble from the mountains often bring down
large fragments of rock, which would da&s;h in pie|ces
any ve&s;&s;els that they &s;hould encounter.</P>
<P>There are many mineral &s;prings, both of the
hot and cold kind, in different parts of the i&s;land,
which the inhabitants of the country find to be
very efficacious for the cure of mo&s;t di&s;tempers;
and people of &s;kill, particularly &s;ome French phy|&s;icians
have examined them by, a chymical analy|&s;is,
and approved of them.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica is extremely well &s;upplied with fi&s;h.
I never indeed could hear of any other fi&s;h in
their rivers or fre&s;h water lakes, except trout and
eel. The&s;e however are found in great plenty,
very fat, and of an uncommon &s;ize.</P>
<P>But the rich trea&s;ure of fi&s;h for Cor&s;ica, is in
its &s;ea; for on all its coa&s;ts, there is the greate&s;t
variety of all the be&s;t kinds, and in particular a
&s;ort of ton or &s;turgeon, and the &s;mall fi&s;h called
<PB N="69" REF="68">
Sardinas, which is of an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te. And in
&s;everal places, the Cor&s;icans have beds of oy&s;ters,
remarkably large; of which they have not only
a &s;ufficiency for their own con&s;umption, but ex|port
a great many to Italy.</P>
<P>From the earlie&s;t times, Cor&s;ica has been fa|mous
for its excellent fi&s;h. Juvenal, when &s;aty|ri&s;ing
the exce&s;&s;ive luxury of the Romans in his
time, who brought every delicacy from the great|e&s;t
di&s;tance, &s;ays,</P>
<Q><L>Mullus erit domini quem mi&s;it Cor&s;ica.</L>

<L>Nor le&s;s the ma&s;ter's pamper'd ta&s;te can plea&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>And &s;ince I am talking of the productions of
the Cor&s;ican &s;ea, I may ob&s;erve, that they here
fi&s;h great quantities of coral, of all the three kinds,
white, red and black. But I &s;hall &s;ay more of
this, when I come to the commerce of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica hath as great a variety of animals as
mo&s;t countries. The hor&s;es here, are in general of
a very &s;mall breed. Procopius in his wars of the
Goths, &s;ays, they run about in herds, and were
little bigger than &s;heep<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE>. They are, however, re|markably
lively, and very hardy; &s;omewhat of the
nature of Welch ponies, or of the little hor&s;es cal|led
<PB N="70" REF="69">
&s;helties, which are found in the highlands and
i&s;lands of Scotland; though I have &s;een Cor&s;ican
hor&s;es of a very good &s;ize. The a&s;&s;es and mules
here, are al&s;o &s;mall, but very &s;trong and wonder|fully
agile in &s;crambling along the &s;teep rocky
mountains; for there are hardly any made roads
in the i&s;land. My worthy friend Sir Alexander
Dick, who&s;e publick &s;pirit in promoting good
roads in an approved age, is well known to all his
countrymen, ob&s;erved that this has been no lo&s;s to
the Cor&s;icans during the time that they have been
employed only in defending them&s;elves in a &s;tate of
natural freedom. Had their country been open
and acce&s;&s;ible, they had been ea&s;ily &s;ubdued by
regular troops. It was in a good mea&s;ure owing
to her rugged hills, that ancient Scotland pre&s;erved
her independency.</P>
<P>The black cattle are larger in proportion than
the hor&s;es; but the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land is
not very proper pa&s;ture for them; &s;o in general,
they do not give much milk, and their beef is
lean and tough. There is not &s;o great occa&s;ion
for milk in Cor&s;ica, as they make no butter, oil
&s;upplying its place, as in Italy, and mo&s;t warm
countries. They however make a good deal of
chee&s;e in &s;ome pieves.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70">
There are here a va&s;t number of goats, which
brow&s;e upon the wild hills, and put one in mind
of Virgil's Bucolicks, where mention is &s;o often
made of this animal. Sheep are al&s;o very plenti|ful,
and have fine feeding; &s;o that their mutton is
as &s;weet and juicy as one could de&s;ire, and attones
for the badne&s;s of the beef.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican &s;heep are generally black, or of
a du&s;ky colour; a white &s;heep being here and
there to be met with in a flock, as black ones are
among&s;t our &s;heep. The wool is coar&s;e and hairy,
which the people of the country impute to their
&s;heep being of a mongrel race. They have had
thoughts of helping this, by importing a good
breed from England or Spain. But I have been
told by the breeders of &s;heep, that the quality of
wool is not &s;o much owing to the kind of &s;heep,
as to the nature of their pa&s;ture; for tho&s;e &s;heep,
who bear very rough fleeces when upon one farm,
will, when put upon another of a different &s;oil,
bear fleeces exceedingly fine. It is very common
here, for &s;heep to have more horns than two:
many of them have &s;ix.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ts of this i&s;land abound in deer.
And there is here a curious animal, called a Muf|foli.
It re&s;embles a &s;tag, but has horns like a ram,
and a &s;kin uncommonly hard. It is very wild, and
<PB N="72" REF="71">
lives on the highe&s;t mountains, where it can hard|ly
be approached, it is &s;o nimble. It will jump
from rock to rock, at the di&s;tance of many feet,
and if hard chaced to the extremity of a cliff,
from whence it can reach no other, it will throw
it&s;elf over, and with &s;urpri&s;ing agility pitch upon
its horns, without receiving any hurt. Yet when
the&s;e creatures are taken young, they are very ea|&s;ily
tamed. M. de Marboeuf, the French com|mander
at the time I was in Cor&s;ica, had then
one of them; and there are now two of them
at Shugborough in Stafford&s;hire, the &s;eat of
Mr. An&s;on, who has a rich a&s;&s;emblage of what
is curious in nature, as well as of what is elegant
in art.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican animals in general, appeared wild
to &s;trangers. Polybius gives us a rea&s;on for it:
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polyb. hi&s;t. lib. xii.</NOTE>. &startq;All the animals in the
i&s;land appear to be wild, on this account, that it is
&s;o rude and &s;teep, and &s;o thick &s;et with trees, that
the &s;hepherds are not able to follow their flocks.&endq;
The wild boar is found here in great plenty. In|deed
<PB N="73" REF="72">
their &s;wine, which are very numerous, have
all a mixture of the wild breed, and being fed on
che&s;tnuts, they are agreeable food.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans are very fond of the diver&s;ion
of hunting the wild boar, for which there is here
a race of dogs, particularly excellent. They have
&s;mooth hair, and are &s;omething between a ma&s;tiff,
and a &s;trong &s;hepherd's dog. They are large, and
exceedingly fierce; but when once they have tak|en
an attachment, they are very faithful to their
ma&s;ter, watch him night and day, and are mo&s;t
undaunted in his defence.</P>
<P>Procopius<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE> tells us, that there were in Cor|&s;ica,
apes wonderfully re&s;embling men; and in|deed,
this i&s;land, and all that quarter of Europe
before it was well inhabited, mu&s;t on account of
its vicinity to Africa, have &s;warmed with apes. Of
the&s;e, however, there are at pre&s;ent no remains;
which is a proof, that different &s;pecies of animals
migrate from one country to another, and when
their race wears out in a particular part of the
globe, it may be very numerous &s;omewhere el&s;e.
Certain it is, that in many countries, the race of
&s;everal animals, well known there in ancient times,
is totally extingui&s;hed. But I am not inclined to
believe that our Creatour allows any of the various
<PB N="74" REF="73">
creatures which his almighty hand hath formed,
to be ab&s;olutely annihilated.</P>
<P>There are hares enough in Cor&s;ica, but no
rabbits; though Polybius, when talking of the ani|mals
of this i&s;land, &s;ays there are rabbits, and is
very minute as to their form and qualities; &s;aying,
that at a di&s;tance, one would take them to be lit|tle
hares, but when they are caught, a great diffe|rence
is perceived, both in their appearance and
ta&s;te. There are here no wolves, nor any of the
larger wild bea&s;ts, unle&s;s foxes can be reckoned
&s;o, which are here indeed extremely large and ra|venous.
It is &s;aid, they not only de&s;troy &s;heep,
but have been known to devour even foals.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a variety of birds in Cor&s;ica; the
eagle, the vulture, wood-pidgeon, turtle, thru&s;h,
blackbird, and many of the &s;maller &s;pecies; and
plenty of game, as partridges, woodcocks, &s;nipes,
and water-fowl in the lakes. The poor thru&s;hes
and blackbirds too, mu&s;t be reckoned as part of
the game, for they are very numerous; and from
there being a great quantity of the arbutus fruit in
the i&s;land, they are exceedingly fat, and are e&s;|teemed
a particular delicacy. It is barbarous to
de&s;troy, for the mere luxury of the table, birds
which make &s;uch fine mu&s;ick; &s;urely their melo|dy
affords more enjoyment, than what can be had
<PB N="75" REF="74">
from eating them. They are, however, a very
common di&s;h in the &s;outhern countries, particu|larly
in France.</P>
<P>In general, it may be ob&s;erved that this i&s;land
is &s;o privileged by nature, that there is no poi&s;o|nous
animal in it. For although there are &s;ome
&s;corpions, their bite carries no venom. The crea|ture
in Cor&s;ica, which approaches neare&s;t to a
poi&s;onous animal is a &s;pider, of an extraordinary
&s;ize. Its bite will irritate, and inflame to a great
degree, and the &s;welling which it occa&s;ions, is very
alarming to one unacquainted with it; but it &s;oon
goes away, and no bad con&s;equences follow,
more than from the &s;tinging of our bees. This
&s;pider, has by &s;ome been mi&s;taken for the famous
tarantula of the kingdom of Naples.</P>
<P>Trees grow remarkably well in Cor&s;ica. There
is here almo&s;t every &s;ort of fore&s;t trees, but it is
principally adorned with pines of different kinds,
oaks, and che&s;tnut trees. All of the&s;e are to be
found of a great &s;ize; &s;ome of the pines in parti|cular,
are exceedingly lofty, and the che&s;tnut tree
grows to a prodigious bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>There are exten&s;ive fore&s;ts in different places.
That of Vico is mo&s;t remarkable. There is in
Cor&s;ica, timber &s;ufficient to maintain a very large
fleet, and the timber here, is much harder than one
<PB N="76" REF="75">
would expect in &s;o &s;outhern a latitude, owing to the
rocky &s;oil of the country, to the perpetual currents
of fre&s;h air through its valleys, and to the tempera|ture
that proceeds from &s;ome of its mountains
being half of the year in &s;now; and this is al&s;o one
great cau&s;e of the &s;alubrity of the climate, in which
Cor&s;ica has much the advantage of Sardinia.</P>
<P>The Ilex, or ever-green oak, is very common
here, and gives the country a cheerful look even
in the depth of winter. The lemon, the orange,
the fig and the almond trees, are al&s;o frequent.
There are, however, few walnut trees, and the ap|ple,
pear, plumb and cherry are not remarkably
good, which is probably owing to no care being
taken of them. Cor&s;ica has the pomegranate in
great perfection, al&s;o the Indian fig and the aloe;
which la&s;t is &s;aid to flower here, as well as in the
Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican mountains are covered with the
arbutus or &s;trawberry tree, which gives a rich glow|ing
appearance as far as the eye can reach. Indeed
the i&s;land is very like the country which Virgil de|&s;cribes
as the &s;eat of rural felicity:
<Q><L>Glande &s;ues laeti redeunt, dant arbuta &s;ylvae:</L>

<L>All various fruits in rich abundance yields;</L>
<L>While ev'ry rocky mountain vines di&s;plays,</L>
<L>Who&s;e grapes are mellow'd by the &s;un's warm rays.</L></Q>
The mulberry grows well here, and is not &s;o
much in danger from blights and thunder&s;torms
as in Italy, and the &s;outh of France; &s;o that
whenever Cor&s;ica enjoys tranquillity, it may have
abundance of &s;ilk. We mu&s;t not omit the laurel,
to which Cor&s;ica has &s;urely a very good claim.
The box tree is a very common plant here.
In mo&s;t countries it is dwarfi&s;h, and generally
u&s;ed only for hedges; but it grows to a good &s;ize
in Cor&s;ica, and may be reckoned a timber tree.
Bochart<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bochart Geog: Sac. pars i. lib. i. cap. 5.</NOTE> has very ingeniou&s;ly &s;hewn, that the

<P>The different kinds of grain in Cor&s;ica, are
wheat, barley, rye, and millet; all of which grow
extremely well in &s;everal parts of the country.
There are no oats here, as indeed hardly ever in
any of the &s;outhern countries. They give their
hor&s;es and mules barley. The millet is excellent
in Cor&s;ica, and when mixed with rye, makes a
<PB N="79" REF="78">
whole&s;ome bread, of which the pea&s;ants are very
fond. Che&s;tnuts may be reckoned a &s;ort of grain
in Cor&s;ica; for they an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of
it. The Cor&s;icans eat them when roa&s;ted by way of
bread. They even have them ground into flour,
and of that they make very good cakes.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t quantity of honey produced in
Cor&s;ica; for the i&s;land has from the earlie&s;t times
been remarkable for its &s;warms of bees. When
it was &s;ubject to the Romans, a tribute was im|po&s;ed
upon it of no le&s;s than two hundred thou|&s;and
pounds of wax yearly<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xlii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. Indeed the lau|rel,
the almond tree, and the myrtle, in the flow|ers
of which, the bees find &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s,
are very common here; and the hills are all
covered with wild thyme, and other fragrant herbs.

<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, a great many mines of
lead, copper, iron, and &s;ilver. Near to San Fio|renzo
is a very rich &s;ilver mine, yielding above the
value of 5 l. &s;terling out of every 100 lib. weight
of ore. The Cor&s;ican iron is remarkably good,
having a toughne&s;s nearly equal to that of the pre|pared
iron of Spain, famous over all the world.
It is &s;aid that the true Spani&s;h barrels are made
of iron which has been worn and beaten for a long
<PB N="81" REF="80">
time in heads of nails in the &s;hoes of the mules,
who travel with a &s;low and ince&s;&s;ant pace along
the hard roads. But a very &s;mall proportion of
the great quantity of Spani&s;h barrels, which are
&s;old in all parts of Europe, can have this advan|tage.
The metal of the Cor&s;ican barrels is little
inferiour to that of the generality of Spani&s;h ones,
and they begin to make them very well.</P>
<P>An allu&s;ion has been drawn from the iron
mines, and the name of Cor&s;ica, to the charac|ter
of its inhabitants. Hieronymus de Marinis,
a Genoe&s;e, who writes on the dominion and go|vernment

<P>There are al&s;o mines of allum, and of &s;altpetre,
in &s;everal parts of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>There is here a kind of granite, extremely
hard, &s;ome of it approaching in quality to the
oriental granite, which was &s;o famous at Rome,
and of which &s;uch noble columns are &s;till remain|ing,
&s;aid to have been brought from Egypt. I
fear it would be extravagant to conjecture, that
&s;ome of the&s;e columns may have been the produce
of Cor&s;ica; for, be&s;ides the perfection of the hiero|glyphicks,
which prove them to have been in
Egypt, I que&s;tion if &s;uch large pieces of granite
could be rai&s;ed in Cor&s;ica. There is here like|wi&s;e
porphyry, and a great variety of ja&s;per.
The magnificent chapel of the grand duke of
Tu&s;cany, at Florence, is fini&s;hed with Cor&s;ican
ja&s;per, with which its in&s;ide is elegantly incru&s;ted,
and has a mo&s;t beautiful appearance.</P>

On the borders of the lake of Ino, they find
pieces of rock cry&s;tal, very clear, and with five
&s;ides, as if they had been cut by a lapidary.
They find &s;ome of it too in the mountains of
I&s;tria. It is &s;o hard, that it &s;trikes fire; and
the Cor&s;icans frequently u&s;e it for flint to their
ful&s;ils.</P>
<P>Near to Ba&s;tia, there is found a &s;ort of mine|ral,
called by the country people, petra quadrata,
becau&s;e it is always found in little &s;quare bits.
It has much about the hardne&s;s of marble, has
a colour like iron-ore, and weighs like lead.
The Cor&s;icans a&s;cribe certain my&s;tical virtues to
this &s;tone, as appears from an old monki&s;h di&s;tich
made in its prai&s;e:</P>

<P>From the de&s;cription of Cor&s;ica, which I have

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A conci&s;e View of the REVOLUTIONS which
CORSICA has undergone from the earlie&s;t
times.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH many di&s;tingui&s;hed authours
have, in conformity with the ta&s;te of the
age, rejected every inquiry into the origin of na|tions,
and pre&s;ented their readers with nothing but
what can be clearly atte&s;ted; I confe&s;s, I am not
for humouring an inordinate avidity for po&s;itive
evidence. By being accu&s;tomed to demon&s;tration,
or what approaches near to it, and at no time giv|ing
any credit to what we do not fully compre|hend,
we are apt to form a pride and in&s;olence
of under&s;tanding; the mind acquires a hardne&s;s
and ob&s;tinacy, incon&s;i&s;tent with the true intention
of our faculties in this imperfect &s;tate, and is ren|dered
unfit for the reception of many important
truths.</P>
<P>But not to deviate into metaphy&s;ical &s;peculati|on,
I have always thought, that even the dark and
fabulous periods are worthy of &s;ome attention.
The &s;ounde&s;t heads among the ancients thought
<PB N="88" REF="86">
&s;o; and their works are therefore more agreeable,
than if they had confined them&s;elves to &s;trict au|thenticity.
The origin of every nation is, as Livy
&s;ays, &startq;Poeticis decora fabulis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. Prooem.</NOTE>, Adorned with
poetical fables.&endq; The&s;e are always amu&s;ing to the
imagination, when neither tedious, nor too extra|vagant.
We love to be led on in a gradual pro|gre&s;s,
and to behold truth emerging from ob&s;cu|rity,
like the &s;un breaking through the clouds.
Such a progre&s;s makes a part of our own nature,
which advances from the dawnings of being in
our infancy, to greater and greater intelligence.</P>
<P>They, who&s;e genius is directed to the &s;tudy of
antiquities, be&s;ides the immediate delight which
&s;uch traditions afford them, are often able, from
hints &s;eemingly detached and unimportant, to trace
the fundamental truth, and extend the bounds of
reality. Few indeed have that peculiar turn for
inquiry, to de&s;erve the name of antiquarians. But
there is an univer&s;al principle of curio&s;ity, with
re&s;pect to times pa&s;t, which makes even conjec|tures
be received with a kind of plea&s;ing venera|tion;
and although the great end of hi&s;tory is in|&s;truction,
I think it is al&s;o valuable, when it &s;erves
to gratify this curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="87">
I &s;hall therefore, in treating of the revolutions
of Cor&s;ica, go as far back as books will &s;erve me;
though at the &s;ame time, I intend to give no more
than a conci&s;e recital, and am rather to &s;hew my
readers what is to be &s;een, than to detain them
till I exhibit a full view of it.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t accounts that we have of Cor&s;ica,
are to be found in Herodotus. He tells us, that
its fir&s;t inhabitants were Phenicians; for, that Cad|mus,
the &s;on of Agenor, when wandering in que&s;t
of Europa, fell upon this i&s;land, which was nam|ed
Calli&s;ta, and left there &s;ome of his countrymen,
with his own cou&s;in Membleareus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 147.</NOTE>. He tells us,
that eight generations after this, Theras brought
a colony to the i&s;land, from Lacedaemon. This
Thereas<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 147.</NOTE> was originally of the race of Cadmus,
but, being uncle by the mother&s;ide to Eury&s;the|nes
and Procles, the two &s;ons of Ari&s;todemus,
<PB N="90" REF="88">
and, on that account, having governed the king|dom
as their tutor; when they grew up, and be|came
kings of Sparta, Theras &s;corning to live a
private life, and to be under the government of
his pupils, determined not to remain at Lacedae|mon,
but to go and join his kindred in the i&s;land
of Cor&s;ica, then called Calli&s;ta. Accordingly,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Ibid. et cap. 148.</NOTE>
he went thither with &s;ome cho&s;en companions, not
with any intention to drive out the former inha|bitants,
but, on the contrary, with mo&s;t friendly
di&s;po&s;itions towards them.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="89">
Sometime after this, the Minyae, a wandering
tribe, who had taken refuge among the Lacedae|monians,
having become obnoxious, on account
of their a&s;piring views, were thrown into pri&s;on,
and condemned to die; but Theras per&s;uaded
the Spartans to &s;pare them, promi&s;ing, that he
would carry them out of the country; and ac|cordingly,
he carried them to the i&s;land of Calli&s;ta,
to join the new colony which he had &s;ettled
there; and from him, the i&s;land was called
Thera.</P>
<P>The&s;e Minyae, though but a wandering tribe
among the Lacedaemonians, were, in reality, of
illu&s;trious de&s;cent, being the po&s;terity of the he|roick
Argonauts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Herodot. lib. iv. cap. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="90">
This account of the fir&s;t peopling of Cor&s;ica,
is a very curious piece of ancient hi&s;tory. It is
indeed very probable, that the Phenicians, or the
Phoceans, where its original inhabitants; &s;eeing
they were the fir&s;t great navigatours in the we&s;tern
part of the world, and &s;ent out colonies to many
di&s;tant countries.</P>
<P>It afterwards got the name of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Cyr|nus,
from the number of its promontories; and
I&s;idorus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I&s;idor. Origin. lib. xiii. cap. 6.</NOTE> relates the manner in which it got
the name of Cor&s;ica. According to him, Cor&s;a,
a Ligurian woman, having often ob&s;erved a bull
&s;wim over to the i&s;land, and return much fatter,
&s;he had the curio&s;ity to follow him in a little ve&s;|&s;el;
and &s;o di&s;covered the i&s;land, with all its
beauty and fertility. Upon which the Ligurians
&s;ent thither a colony; and from Cor&s;a, who had
made the di&s;covery, they called the i&s;land Cor&s;i|ca.
This is ludicrous enough; but we may trace
what has given ri&s;e to &s;o extraordinary a fiction,
<PB N="93" REF="91">
when we con&s;ider, that very probably, a people
from the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Italy, either the Li|gurians,
or the Etru&s;cans, have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>Whatever may be in this conjecture, it is cer|tain,
that its next ma&s;ters were the Carthagini|ans,
who extended their conque&s;ts over all the
i&s;lands of the Mediterranean. Ari&s;totle relates a
mo&s;t extraordinary piece of Punick policy, with
re&s;pect to Cor&s;ica. Finding that is was difficult
to keep the inhabitants in &s;ubjection, they ordered
the whole of the vines and olives in the i&s;land to
be pulled up, and forbid the Cor&s;icans, under
the pain of death, to &s;ow their fields with any
kind of grain, &s;o that they might be kept in the
mo&s;t ab&s;olute dependance; and, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of a very fertile territory, be obliged to re&s;ort to
Africa, to &s;eek the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life. So
early was the cowardly and barbarous policy of a
trading republick exerci&s;ed again&s;t this people.</P>
<P>Cor&s;ica next pa&s;&s;ed under the dominion of
Rome. In the fir&s;t Punick war, and about the year
493 from the building of the city, Lucius Corne|lius
Scipio conquered the i&s;land<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. Epit. lib. xvii. Flor. lib. ii. cap. 2.</NOTE>, being oppo&s;ed
<PB N="94" REF="92">
by an army of Sardinians and Cor&s;icans, headed
by Hanno, a Carthaginian general.</P>
<P>It appears however, that the Cor&s;icans could
not bear &s;ubjection with patience, for they were
continually attempting to get free. Of this, we
have an in&s;tance in the epitome of the twentieth
book of Livy. We next find them engaged
again&s;t M. Pinarius the praetor, who &s;lew 2000
of them, obliged them to give ho&s;tages, and took
them bound to pay a tribute of 100,000 lib. of
wax, every year<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. xl. cap. 34.</NOTE>. Afterwards C. Cicereius
the praetor, was obliged to give them battle,
when 1700 of them were killed, and upwards of
1070 taken pri&s;oners, and upon this occa&s;ion,
their annual tribute was increa&s;ed to 200,000 lib.
weight of wax<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib. lib. xlii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. From the&s;e in&s;tances, we
may &s;ee that Cor&s;ica was formerly much more
populous than it is now, and that it hath been
able to furni&s;h amazing quantities of honey. We
are told by Pliny, that Papyrius Na&s;o fir&s;t tri|umphed
over the Cor&s;icans, on the Alban
mount
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. v. cap. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has already been &s;aid, that the Romans
founded two colonies in Cor&s;ica. The i&s;land was,
<PB N="95" REF="93">
like their other provinces, governed by a praetor.
It was al&s;o made to &s;erve for a place of exile;
and was very proper for what they called &startq;Rele|gatio
in in&s;ulam, bani&s;hment to an i&s;land.&endq; But
the Romans never had a firm hold of this coun|try,
where that &s;pirit of liberty, which tyrants
call rebellion, was ever breaking forth.</P>
<P>On the irruption of the barbarous nations,
Cor&s;ica &s;hared the &s;ame fate with the other do|minions
of the ruined empire. It fell a prey
to the Goths, who e&s;tabli&s;hed there the feudal
&s;y&s;tem, as they did in every other country to
which their arms penetrated. Some authours
&s;ay, that Cor&s;ica was conquered by Alarick,
the fir&s;t king of the Goths; but according to Pro|copius,
it was conquered by a detachment &s;ent
out by Totilas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. iii. cap. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this period, the hi&s;tory of Cor&s;ica is for
many ages a continued &s;eries of wars, ravage and
de&s;truction, by a variety of contending powers.
We are here very much in the dark, without any
&s;ufficient clew to guide us. We find in many
authours detached remarks concerning the i&s;land;
but it is difficult to arrange them in tolerable
<PB N="96" REF="94">
order, &s;ince the dates are almo&s;t always uncer|tain.</P>
<P>I &s;hall however give a &s;hort view of what &s;eems
to have been the progre&s;s of events.</P>
<P>When the power of the Saracens ro&s;e to that
height, of which we read with amazement,
they drove the Goths from Cor&s;ica, and main|tained
the dominion there for a con&s;iderable
time.</P>
<P>It is believed, that they fir&s;t gave the title of
kingdom to Cor&s;ica; and, to this day, the coat
armonial of the i&s;land bears a Moor's head on its
&s;hield.</P>
<P>There are Moori&s;h coins frequently dug up
in Cor&s;ica; and near to Ajaccio, are Saracen
tombs, which appear to have had &s;ome magnifi|cence.
They are &s;ubterraneous vaults, &s;upported
by &s;tone pillars; and in them are found &s;epul|chral
urns of an earthen compo&s;ition, &s;imilar to
brick.</P>
<P>It would appear, that the Pope has always had
a view towards the annexation of Cor&s;ica to his
territories; and, that he at different times in&s;ti|gated
the kings of Arragon, as well as the &s;ove|reigns
of France, to make again&s;t it, what in the
&s;tile of tho&s;e times was called a holy war; which
<PB N="97" REF="95">
kind of wars were always calculated to &s;erve the
political views of the holy father.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Cor&s;ica was actually conquered by one
of the kings of France; &s;ome &s;ay, by Pepin, and
others, by Charles Martel. The Cor&s;icans &s;hew
to this day, a fountain, called by the name of
Charles, in the pieve of Ale&s;ani, and, as they &s;ay,
on the &s;pot where this gallant prince vanqui&s;hed
the Moors.</P>
<P>By the kings of France, Cor&s;ica was re&s;igned,
in a perpetual gift, to the holy &s;ee. The Sara|cens
however, from time to time returned; &s;o
that the pope had but a very feeble and uncertain
&s;way.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e availing them&s;elves of the di&s;|tracted
&s;tate of the i&s;land, had very early con|trived
to &s;ettle a colony at Bonifaccio; and em|boldened
by degrees, they landed troops on other
parts of the country, and began to bear a formi|dable
appearance.</P>
<P>This could not fail to incen&s;e the court of
Rome, and to draw down upon them the thunders
of the Vatican, from whence the holy father u&s;ed,
in tho&s;e ages, to fulminate with &s;erious effect
again&s;t the greate&s;t powers in Europe. Accord|ingly,
the Genoe&s;e were excommunicated by
<PB N="98" REF="96">
pope Gregory the &s;eventh, which made them at
that time de&s;i&s;t from their project.</P>
<P>In this fluctuating &s;ituation Cor&s;ica continued,
till one of the popes, but which of them hi&s;to|rians
are not agreed, &s;ent thither Hugo Colonna,
a nobleman of Rome, accompanied by &s;everal
others of the Roman nobility, with a good force
under his command, in order to expel the infidels
from the i&s;land. When Colonna landed, he was
joined by many of the inhabitants, who, during
the &s;truggle which had been &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;o long,
and with &s;uch violence, had again and again en|deavoured
to maintain them&s;elves in a &s;tate of
freedom, and had elected a certain number of
chiefs, to whom they gave the title of caporali.</P>
<P>The&s;e caporali gave all the aid in their power
to Colonna; and, by their influence over the peo|ple,
they &s;oon brought together &s;uch a body of
men, that Colonna was enabled totally to rout
the Saracens, and to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them for ever.</P>
<P>The Moors being rendered de&s;perate by this
unexpected blow, were forced to quit the i&s;land;
but before they went, they burnt all that they
po&s;&s;ibly could; and to this we mu&s;t greatly im|pute
the de&s;olation which is yet to be &s;een in
Cor&s;ica, and the de&s;truction of their ancient mo|numents
and publick archives.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="97">
Hugo Colonna &s;ettled in Cor&s;ica, having ob|tained
from the Pope di&s;tingui&s;hed honours and
exten&s;ive grants. The family of Colonna is one
of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, and mo&s;t ancient in the
world. So early as the 1200, mention is made
of Pietro Colonna, the eight of the name. The
branch which &s;ettled in Cor&s;ica, continued long
in great &s;plendour, enjoying the noble fief of
I&s;tria; but, by the confu&s;ions and troubles which
the i&s;land has been thrown into, by the bloody
conte&s;ts between the Genoe&s;e and the patriotick
Cor&s;icans, that family hath &s;uffered prodigiou&s;ly,
and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are reduced to a very narrow
compa&s;s. The pre&s;ent head of the family, is a
worthy, &s;en&s;ible man, and very zealous in the
great cau&s;e. I was lodged in his hou&s;e at Solla|car&ograve;,
where I found Pa&s;cal Paoli.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the Cor&s;ican counts, mar|qui&s;&s;es
and barons, derive their origin from this
period; for I can &s;ee no time &s;o proper for their
fir&s;t taking place here.</P>
<P>The i&s;land remained for &s;ome time in tolerable
quiet. But partly from the di&s;&s;en&s;ions of diffe|rent
parties among them&s;elves, ever impatient of
contradiction, and partly from the repeated at|tacks
of the Genoe&s;e, who&s;e hankering after this
little kingdom &s;till continued, there were &s;uch
<PB N="100" REF="98">
di&s;orders, and &s;uch a defect of good government,
that the Pope thought proper to make it over to
the Pi&s;ans, who were then in great power.</P>
<P>This grant was upon advantageous terms for
the holy father, like the many grants of fiefs
which he u&s;ed to give to various princes, to be
held of the &s;ee of Rome. A learned Profe&s;&s;our
of the univer&s;ity of Pi&s;a, has compo&s;ed a very cu|rious
di&s;&s;ertation concerning the ancient dominion
of his countrymen over Cor&s;ica. It is to be found
in the 7th volume of the E&s;&s;ays of the Acade|my
of Cortona.</P>
<P>The Pi&s;ans, while their republick flouri&s;hed,
and their force was con&s;iderable, maintained their
authority over Cor&s;ica to very good purpo&s;e; and,
as far as we can gather from different authors,
the i&s;land enjoyed more repo&s;e and tranquillity
during this period, than it has ever been known
to enjoy.</P>
<P>But this calm was of &s;hort endurance; for the
Genoe&s;e, irritated to find them&s;elves now ef|fectually
excluded from an i&s;land on which they
had long &s;et their hearts; and being, over and
above, the determined rivals of Pi&s;a, a keen
and ob&s;tinate war was carried on between the&s;e
&s;tates; at la&s;t, the Genoe&s;e prevailed, in the fa|mous
&s;ea-fight at Malora, near the mouth of the
<PB N="101" REF="99">
Arno; after which, they got entirely the ma&s;tery
of Pi&s;a, and &s;o were at length enabled to &s;eize
upon Cor&s;ica, about the beginning of the four|teenth
century.</P>
<P>Thus were the Cor&s;icans, for the fir&s;t time,
brought under the power of the Genoe&s;e; with
whom they have &s;ince had &s;uch &s;truggles for that
freedom, which they appear to have at all times
attempted to recover.</P>
<P>If I have erred in any part of this recital, I
am &s;ure it is without any intention. I know &s;ome
Genoe&s;e writers have maintained, that a &s;ignor
Ademar, of their nation, was employed in the
fir&s;t conque&s;t of the i&s;land by the kings of France.
I confe&s;s I do not &s;ee &s;ufficient authority for this.
But &s;uppo&s;ing it had been &s;o, Ademar could on|ly
be an officer under the French king. We are
certain, that the French king made the conque&s;t,
becau&s;e he afterwards made a gift of the i&s;land to
the pope.</P>
<P>But I would not dwell long upon &s;uch di&s;|qui&s;itions.
There are many pieces lately pu|bli&s;hed,
both by the Cor&s;icans and the Ge|noe&s;e;
in which the authours, with great labour,
endeavour to refute each others hypothe&s;es with
regard to many ancient facts in the hi&s;tory of
Cor&s;ica. Here indeed, there is full &s;cope for all
<PB N="102" REF="100">
parties; &s;ince tho&s;e periods are &s;o ob&s;cure, that
every writer may fill them up according to the
turn of his imagination; ju&s;t as people who are
abroad in a dark night, may with equal keenne&s;s,
and equal appearance of rea&s;on affirm, that they
&s;ee objects totally different.</P>
<P>Let Cor&s;ica have been the property of the
Phenicians, the Etru&s;cans, the Carthaginians, the
Romans, the Goths, the Saracens: let it have been
a conque&s;t of France; a gift from that kingdom
to the pope; a gift again from the pope to the
Pi&s;ans, and at length a conque&s;t of Genoa; &s;till
we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the plain and funda|mental
principle, that the Cor&s;icans are men, and
have a right to liberty; which, if u&s;urped by any
power whatever, they have at all times a ju&s;t title
to vindicate.</P>
<P>In reviewing the&s;e &s;trange and rapid revolu|tions,
which this i&s;land has undergone, we may
join with Seneca<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Seneca de con&s;olatione.</NOTE> in reflecting on the muta|bility
of human affairs, and be &s;ilent on the
changes which happen to individuals, when we
contemplate the vici&s;&s;itudes of a whole nation.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e having obtained the undoubted
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cor&s;ica, they were eager to enjoy
their power, and thought they could not fully
<PB N="103" REF="101">
enjoy it, but by exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;evere do|minion.
What we have long anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired,
acquires in our minds an imaginary and extrava|gant
value; and when we actually become po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of it, a moderate and rea&s;onable fruition,
&s;eems in&s;ipid and un&s;atisfactory to our heightened
expectations. We are even, as it were, uncertain
if we really have it. And generally, we never re&s;t,
till by abu&s;ing our powers, we de&s;troy what we
e&s;teemed &s;o highly.</P>
<P>An individual, who acquires a large fortune,
and a &s;tate, which acquires an increa&s;e of domi|minion,
may be very properly compared. He who
gets a large fortune, thinks he cannot &s;hew his
command of riches, but by &s;uch acts of profu|&s;ion,
as mu&s;t quickly di&s;&s;ipate them. And a
&s;tate, which has acquired an increa&s;e of domini|on,
thinks its &s;overeignty is not &s;ufficiently
manife&s;ted, but by &s;uch acts of arbitrary op|pre&s;&s;ion,
as mu&s;t tend to force its &s;ubjects to
throw off their allegiance. For however a people
may, from indolence, from timidity, or from
other motives, &s;ubmit for a &s;ea&s;on to a certain
degree of tyranny; if it is long continued, and
pu&s;hed to an exorbitant length, nature will re|volt,
and the original rights of men will call for
redre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102">
The Genoe&s;e were the wor&s;t nation to whom
Cor&s;ica could have fallen. The Cor&s;icans were
a people, impetuous, violent and brave; who
had weathered many a &s;torm; and who could not
have been governed, but by a &s;tate of which they
&s;tood &s;omewhat in awe, and which, by humanity
and proper encouragement, might have conciliat|ed
their affections. Whereas, the Genoe&s;e were a
nation of republicans ju&s;t in the neighbourhood
of the i&s;landers; who had long been their ene|mies;
who had made &s;o many cunning, and im|potent
attempts to &s;eize upon the i&s;land, that al|though,
by the unexpected cour&s;e of events, they
were now ma&s;ters of it, the Cor&s;icans could not
look upon them with any re&s;pect. And as it has
been always remarked that the foreign &s;ubjects
of a little republick, are much wor&s;e u&s;ed, than
tho&s;e of a great kingdom; they had rea&s;on to
expect nothing but avowed tyranny from Ge|noa.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Genoe&s;e, who were them|&s;elves
in an un&s;table, and perilous condition,
&s;eeking the protection &s;ometimes of one pow|erful
&s;tate, and &s;ometimes of another, did not
treat the Cor&s;icans with that gentlene&s;s and
confidence, which alone could have &s;ecured their
attachment and obedience, by in&s;en&s;ibly leading
<PB N="105" REF="103">
them to a participation of the culture and fe|licity
of civil life, and accu&s;toming them to con|&s;ider
the Genoe&s;e as their fellow &s;ubjects, and
friends.</P>
<P>They took a direct a contrary cour&s;e; and,
although they did not u&s;e &s;o de&s;perate a mea|&s;ure,
as that of the Carthaginians, their oppre&s;|&s;ion
was heavy; their &s;y&s;tem was not to ren|der
the Cor&s;icans happier and better, but by
keeping them in ignorance, and under the mo&s;t
abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to prevent their endeavouring
to get free; while Genoa drained the i&s;land of all
&s;he could po&s;&s;ibly get, choo&s;ing rather even to
have le&s;s advantage by tyranny, than to have a
much greater advantage, and ri&s;k the con&s;equences
of permitting to the inhabitants the ble&s;&s;ings of
freedom.</P>
<P>In this unhappy &s;ituation was Cor&s;ica. Often
did the natives ri&s;e in arms; but having no head
to direct them, they were immediately quelled.
So apprehen&s;ive however were the Genoe&s;e, that,
according to their own hi&s;torian Filippini, they
burnt 120 of the be&s;t villages in Cor&s;ica, while
4000 people left the i&s;land.</P>
<P>What &s;hewed the Genoe&s;e policy in the wor&s;t
light, and could not but be very galling to the
Cor&s;icans who remained at home, was, that many
<PB N="106" REF="104">
of the&s;e in&s;landers, who had gone over to the
continent, made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in mo&s;t
of the European &s;tates, both in learning, and in
arms.</P>
<P>About the 1550, Cor&s;ica revived under the
conduct of a great hero, who aro&s;e for the de|liverance
of his country. This was Sampiero di
Ba&s;telica. He early di&s;covered extraordinary parts
and &s;pirit; and had the advantage of being edu|cated
in the hou&s;e of cardinal Hypolitus de Me|dicis,
the nephew of pope Clement the &s;eventh.
He was created colonel of the Cor&s;icans in France,
and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in almo&s;t every one
of the great actions of that nation in his
time.</P>
<P>After the death of Francis the fir&s;t, he went
home to his native country; where he married
Vannina, heire&s;s of the hou&s;e of Ornano, of the
mo&s;t ancient and rich of the Cor&s;ican nobility;
and from this time, he was generally called Sam|piero
di Ornano.</P>
<P>Being moved with the mi&s;erable &s;tate of his
countrymen, he re&s;olved to procure them relief;
and for this, a very favourable opportunity then
pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here hi&s;tory begins again to open upon us.
The clouds of antiquity, and barbari&s;m are di&s;|per&s;ed,
<PB N="107" REF="105">
and we proceed clearly, under the guidance
of the illu&s;trious Thuanus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuan. Hi&s;t. lib. xii. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>France had of a long time claimed a right o|ver
Genoa; but after the battle of Pavia, when
the French were forced entirely to abandon Italy,
that claim had become of no effect. Henry the
&s;econd however, having commenced a new war in
Italy, again&s;t the emperour Charles the fifth, re|&s;olved
to a&s;&s;ert his power in Cor&s;ica; Sampiero di
Ornano encouraged this di&s;po&s;ition, that he might
avail him&s;elf of it, to free the i&s;land from a yoke
which galled it &s;o much.</P>
<P>He repre&s;ented to Henry, that as the Genoe&s;e
had taken part with the emperour, his maje&s;ty
was debarred from all entrance to Italy by &s;ea;
whereas, by putting him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cor|&s;ica,
he might have a free pa&s;&s;age through the Me|diterranean,
and might, at the &s;ame time, employ
that i&s;land as a commodious garri&s;on, where troops
and warlike &s;tores might be lodged, to be from
thence thrown in upon Naples or Tu&s;cany, as the
&s;ituation of affairs &s;hould require.</P>
<P>An expedition was therefore ordered to Cor&s;i|ca,
in the year 1553, under the command of
<PB N="108" REF="106">
general Paul de Thermes, accompanied by Sam|piero
di Ornano, Jourdain des Ur&s;ins, and &s;everal
other able commanders. Henry had al&s;o the
Turks joined with him in this expedition, having
prevailed with their fourth Emperour, Solyman,
&s;tyled the magnificent, to &s;end out a large fleet to
the Tu&s;can &s;ea<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knowles's hi&s;tory of the Turks, p. 757.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This expedition was powerfully oppo&s;ed by
the Genoe&s;e; who had given Cor&s;ica in charge
to their celebrated bank of St. George. The great
Andrew Doria, though then in his eighty &s;eventh
year, bid defiance to age and infirmities, and, &s;ince
Cor&s;ica was an object of importance to his coun|try,
the gallant veteran embarked with all the &s;pi|rit
of his glorious youth, having a formidable ar|mament
under his command.</P>
<P>The war was carried on with vigour on both
&s;ides. At fir&s;t however, &s;everal of the be&s;t towns
were taken by the French and Turks, particular|ly
Ajaccio, where were a number of merchants,
who&s;e riches afforded good pillage to the enemy,
and helped to make the enterpri&s;e go on with more
&s;pirit. The Cor&s;icans joined in the common cau&s;e;
and the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land was once fairly
delivered from the tyrant.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107">
But the Genoe&s;e were &s;o well commanded by
the intrepid Doria, and had be&s;ides &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from Charles the fifth, who &s;ent &s;trong reinforce|ments
both of Spani&s;h and German troops, that
the expedition was not entirely effectual.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this war, &s;o many valourous
actions were performed, that, fired with the con|templation
of them, I am almo&s;t tempted to for|get
the limited bounds of my plan, and of my
abilities, and to a&s;&s;ume the province of an hi&s;to|rian;
I hope a Livy, or a Clarendon, &s;hall one
day ari&s;e, and di&s;play to &s;ucceeding ages, the Cor|&s;ican
bravery, with the lu&s;ture which it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans were now &s;o violent again&s;t the
Genoe&s;e, that they re&s;olved with one accord, that
rather than return under the dominion of the repu|blick,
they would throw them&s;elves into the arms
of the great Turk. At length however, a treaty
was concluded between the Cor&s;icans and Geno|e&s;e,
advantageous and honourable for the former,
having for guarantee, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But, as there was an inveterate, and implacable
hatred between tho&s;e two nations, this treaty did
not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and upon Henry's death, the
&s;ame oppre&s;&s;ion as formerly, became flagrant in
Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="108">
Sampiero di Ornano, who had been again for
&s;ometime in France, having lo&s;t his royal ma&s;ter,
went him&s;elf to the Ottoman Porte, and earne&s;tly
&s;olicited fre&s;h a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his unhappy nation.
But the face of affairs was changed. The &s;ame
political views no longer exi&s;ted; and it mu&s;t be
a miracle indeed, when &s;tates are moved by vir|tuous
principles of genero&s;ity. This brave man,
being un&s;ucce&s;sful at Con&s;tantinople, returned to
Cor&s;ica, where his pre&s;ence in&s;pired the i&s;landers
with fortitude, and occa&s;ioned a very general revolt.</P>
<P>He carried on his glorious enterpri&s;e with con|&s;iderable
effect; and the more &s;o, that, as he had
now no foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was not looked
upon as very formidable, and the republick made
little preparation again&s;t him. But he was &s;top|ped
in his career by the treachery of the Genoe&s;e,
who had him ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, by a wretch of
the name of Vitolli<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Michael Metello, who writes a particular hi&s;tory of the Cor&s;ican revolt under Sampiero, gives a different account of his death. He will have him to have been killed from mo|tives of private revenge, by his brother in law, Michael An|gelo di Ornano. But, be&s;ides the improbability that Vannina, the &s;pou&s;e of Sampiero, had a brother, when it is certain &s;he inherited the family domains; I own, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as related by &s;everal other authours, appears to me &s;o much of a piece with the oppre&s;&s;ions of Genoa, both before and &s;ince, that I give it the preference.</NOTE>, in the year 1567.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="109">
Thus fell Sampiero di Ba&s;telica di Ornano, a
Cor&s;ican worthy of being ranked with the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed heroes. He di&s;played great bravery
and fidelity in foreign &s;ervice; and with unremit|ting
con&s;tancy endeavoured to re&s;tore the liber|ties
of his country. Thuanus calls him &startq;Vir
bello impiger et animo invictus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuani Hi&s;t. lib. xli. cap. 31.</NOTE>, A man active
in war, and of a &s;pirit invincible.&endq; The &s;hades
which were in his private conduct, are to be for|gotten
in the admiration of his publick virtues. His
&s;on Alphon&s;o, and his grand&s;on John Bapti&s;t, both
arrived at the dignity of mare&s;chal of France,
after which his po&s;terity failed.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o di Ornano, who had been brought
up in the court of Henry the &s;econd, kept alive
the patriotick &s;truggle for a &s;hort while; but un|able
to make head again&s;t the republick, he re|tired
from the i&s;land and &s;ettled in France.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e were thus again put in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of Cor&s;ica. Enraged at what they had &s;uf|fered
from a daring rebellion, as they termed it;
and &s;till dreading a new in&s;urrection, they thought
only of avenging them&s;elves on the Cor&s;icans; and
<PB N="112" REF="110">
plunging that people &s;till lower than ever, in ig|norance
and &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Their oppre&s;&s;ion became now, if po&s;&s;ible,
wor&s;e than before. They were inflamed with hot|ter
re&s;entment, and their tyranny formed it&s;elf
into &s;omething of a regular &s;y&s;tem. Forgetful of
every equitable convention that France had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
they exerci&s;ed, without controul, the ut|mo&s;t
rigours of arbitrary power. They permit|ted
nothing to be exported from the i&s;land, but
to Genoa, where, of nece&s;&s;ity, the Cor&s;icans were
obliged to &s;ell their merchandi&s;e at a very low
rate; and in years of &s;carcity, the i&s;land was
drained of provi&s;ions by a &s;ort of legal plunder.
For the inhabitants were forced to bring them to
Genoa, &s;o that actual famine was often occa&s;ioned
in Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e did every thing in their power to
foment internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions in Cor&s;ica, to which
the people were naturally too much inclined.
The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t horrid blood|&s;hed.
They reckon that no le&s;s than 1700 Cor|&s;icans
were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the &s;pace of two years.
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were, in the fir&s;t place, a certain
cau&s;e of hatred among the Cor&s;icans, and often
between the be&s;t families, &s;o that they would not
unite in any &s;cheme for the general liberty. And
<PB N="113" REF="111">
in the &s;econd place, they could be turned to very
good account, either by confi&s;cating the e&s;tates of
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, or by making the criminals pay heavy
compen&s;ations to the judge. The judge could
wave the pur&s;uit of ju&s;tice by &s;aying, &startq;Non pro|cedatur,
Let there be no proce&s;s;&endq; which could
ea&s;ily be cloaked under the pretence of &s;ome de|fect

was called &startq;Ex informata con&s;cientia, The infor|mation

not obliged to give any account.</P>
<P>It was not till the year 1738, that Genoa made
an edict again&s;t this mo&s;t dreadful abu&s;e.</P>
<P>M. De Monte&s;quieu thus writes concerning it,
with that calm dignity which becomes &s;o great a

<P>During this oppre&s;&s;ion, it was common to con|demn

that they might purcha&s;e their liberty at a high
price; and it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive greater
barbarity, than what the&s;e i&s;landers now endured.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e &s;ent to Cor&s;ica a commi&s;&s;ary ge|neral,
or governour over the whole i&s;land; who&s;e
office continued for two years. He was generally a
nobleman of de&s;perate fortune, who by &s;hameful
extortions, returned home in opulence; and by his
intere&s;t in the &s;enate, prevented any inquiry being
made into his conduct. For although the unhap|py
Cor&s;icans offered many complaints to the re|publick,
they were in&s;tantly &s;tifled; which was
not difficult to do, as the Cor&s;icans were con&s;ider|ed
to be &s;o turbulent and mutinous, that no ad|mini&s;tration
could plea&s;e them; and as every &s;ena|tour
who was to give his vote, did not know, but
<PB N="115" REF="113">
by extravagance, he him&s;elf might one day be
obliged to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame expedient.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ary general had his re&s;idence at
Ba&s;tia. There were al&s;o other commi&s;&s;aries at Cal|vi,
Ajaccio and Bonifaccio; and Lieutenants, and
inferiour officers, di&s;per&s;ed over the i&s;land; who
all in their &s;everal &s;tations, contributed to rob, and
to ruin the country; while they triumphed in a
mean &s;ecurity, that as Cor&s;ica was overlooked, and,
as it were, hid in a corner of Europe, their inju|rious
proceedings were not known to the world.</P>
<P>During this period of &s;ecret, and cruel oppre&s;|&s;ion,
there happened a very curious event, the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a colony of Greeks in Cor&s;ica;
of which I &s;hall now give an account.</P>
<P>After Mahomet and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ours had &s;ubdued
almo&s;t the whole of ancient Greece, and Scander|beg,
who &s;o gloriou&s;ly defended his country, was
dead; there &s;till remained a few brave &s;ouls who
inhabited a part of Peloponne&s;us of old, now the
kingdom of Morea. This part was, what is cal|led
a branch of the Maina, the very &s;pot where
Lacedemon &s;tood.</P>
<P>Here, covered by impa&s;&s;able mountains, with
only a &s;mall entrance, they re&s;i&s;ted the Ottoman
empire, as Leonidas formerly re&s;i&s;ted the millions
of Xerxes.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114">
But when the Turks got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;le
of Candia, in 1669, they came by &s;ea, and made
a de&s;cent upon Maina, penetrated into the heart
of the territory, and &s;oon became ma&s;ters of it;
and then, the unfortunate po&s;terity of the Spar|tans,
were reduced to a &s;tate, little better than &s;la|very.
Exorbitant taxes were impo&s;ed upon them;
their fine&s;t women were forced away to the &s;era|glios;
and towers were built in different parts of the
country, where troops were garri&s;oned, to keep
them in awe; &s;o that they had no hope of delive|rance.
Their &s;pirits gradually &s;unk, and many of
them embraced the faith of the Koran.</P>
<P>Still, however, a &s;park of the ancient fire was
pre&s;erved among&s;t tho&s;e, who dwelt at Porto Vi|tilo;
who, de&s;pairing to &s;ee any change in their
dejected country, came to the re&s;olution of aban|doning
it altogether, and of &s;eeking an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
&s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>With this view, they &s;ent to Italy, deputies who
had &s;ome acquaintance with the different &s;tates,
and who were intru&s;ted by the community to look
out for a convenient &s;ettlement, and to conclude
the terms of a convention.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e &s;ent them over to Cor&s;ica, where
they were &s;hewn a tract of ground, belonging to
the chamber of the &s;tate, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of
<PB N="117" REF="115">
the i&s;land, about three miles from the &s;ea. The
deputies were very well plea&s;ed with it; and, on
their return to Genoa, they entered into an agree|ment
with the republick.</P>
<P>They then went home to Greece, and having
made a report to their countrymen, the plan was
approved of; and, in the month of October,
1676, the&s;e &startq;Tri&s;tes reliquiae Danaum, Sad re|mains
of the Greeks,&endq; embarked, in all about
1000 &s;ouls. The family of Stefanopoli was the
mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed among them, and conducted
the whole enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>They arrived at Genoa, in the month of Janu|ary,
1677, where they remained, till the month
of March. The republick paid all the expence
of their freight, and afforded them lodging and
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, till they were &s;afely landed in Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>The conventions entered into, were, that the
Genoe&s;e granted to the Greeks, the territories of
Paomia, Ruvida and Salogna, in perpetual fief.
They furni&s;hed them with hou&s;es, with grain,
and with cattle; and engaged to maintain a body
of Genoe&s;e &s;oldiers to defend them again&s;t all in|&s;ults,
for the fir&s;t years of their re&s;idence. They
al&s;o appointed a Genoe&s;e gentleman, with the
title of Directour, as judge over them, who&s;e office
was to be biennial, &s;o that it &s;hould go by rotati|on,
<PB N="118" REF="116">
among the Genoe&s;e nobility; and they agreed
to &s;upport, at the expence of the republick, a vi|car,
&s;killed in the Greek language, who &s;hould
in&s;truct their children in different &s;tudies; and, at
the &s;ame time, celebrate ma&s;s, and preach in the
chapel of the directour.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Greeks obliged them|&s;elves
to cultivate the lands, and with all expedi|tion,
to di&s;charge the debts they &s;hould incur to
the republick, for &s;upplying them with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
in the infancy of their colony. They al&s;o
obliged them&s;elves, to pay to the republick, a tax
of five livres, for every family, be&s;ides a tenth of
all their productions, and to be ready to &s;erve the
republick, either by &s;ea, or land, whenever their
&s;ervice &s;hould be required.</P>
<P>Thus, was this colony &s;ettled. They enjoyed
the free exerci&s;e of their own rites of religion,
according to the Greek church, having brought
with them the bi&s;hop of Porto Vitilo.</P>
<P>They had al&s;o brought with them, &s;ome re|ligious,
of the order of St. Ba&s;il, the only order
in their church; who e&s;tabli&s;hed a convent in a
wild and romantick valley. But the Genoe&s;e did
not approve of the&s;e fathers; and, in a &s;hort time,
their convent was &s;hut up.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="117">
The Greeks found them&s;elves very ea&s;y and
happy, for a good many years. By their indu&s;|try
and activity, they beautified and enriched
their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and built very good hou&s;es,
doing every thing with a ta&s;te, altogether new in
Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>But their neighbours, the natives of the i&s;land,
did not live in great harmony with them. Per|haps,
in this, envy may have had &s;ome &s;hare; for
their vines and their olives, their herds and their
flocks, were, by care and &s;kill, much &s;uperiour
to tho&s;e of the Cor&s;icans. But be&s;ides, the i&s;land|ders
looked upon the Greeks as auxiliaries of the
Genoe&s;e, to whom they, from time to time, &s;wore
fidelity; and were ever ready to give their a&s;&s;i&s;|tance.
They al&s;o knew, that the Greeks were
well &s;upplied with arms; and therefore, there
were frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes between them and the
pea&s;ants of the province of Vico, of which their
territories had formerly made a part; and in the
year 1729, when the nation ro&s;e again&s;t the Ge|noe&s;e,
the Greeks were &s;eriou&s;ly attacked; and
many a de&s;perate battle they fought with great
bravery. The Genoe&s;e formed three regular
companies of them, to whom they gave pay;
and they were always employed in the mo&s;t dif|ficult
enterpri&s;es. In particular, they were de|tached
<PB N="120" REF="118">
to attempt taking the ca&s;tle of Corte from
the patriots; on which occa&s;ion, they were &s;orely
defeated, and a great number of them were kil|led.</P>
<P>After various &s;truggles, which the plan of this
work does not allow me to relate, the Greeks
were forced to leave their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and retire
to Ajaccio, where they now &s;upport them&s;elves
tolerably by their labour: and being convinced
of the tyranny of the Genoe&s;e, wait with im|patience
for their total expul&s;ion from the i&s;land;
and hope from the genero&s;ity of Paoli and the
Cor&s;icans, that protection and encouragement
which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>This colony has been &s;ober, virtuous and in|du&s;trious;
and if they have acted in a ho&s;tile man|ner
again&s;t the nation, it was from a good prin|ciple;
from the fidelity which they owed to the
republick that had granted them an a&s;ylum;
which fidelity they would ever have pre&s;erved,
had not the republick included them in the gene|ral
oppre&s;&s;ion. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve of this colony, that
it hath had the honour of producing an excellent
phy&s;ician, Signor Giovanni Stefanopoli, the fir&s;t
who hath had the wi&s;dom and the &s;pirit to bring
inoculation into practice in Cor&s;ica, by which he
pre&s;erves multitudes of lives; and may therefore
<PB N="121" REF="119">
be ju&s;tly reckoned a di&s;tingui&s;hed benefactor to
the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Long de&s;pi&s;ed, plundered and oppre&s;&s;ed, the
Cor&s;icans again revived in 1729, when the war
commenced, which, with &s;ome intervals, has con|tinued
till now; and after &s;o many changes, mi&s;|fortunes
and &s;truggles, will probably fix on a &s;o|lid
ba&s;is the Cor&s;ican liberty.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to &s;ee how great events are
produced by little cau&s;es. A late authour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;ieur Richer.</NOTE> hath
given us an entertaining &s;election of &s;uch in&s;tan|ces,
from the hi&s;tories of different nations. The
ri&s;e of the Cor&s;icans in 1729, was occa&s;ioned
by a &s;ingle paolo, a piece worth about five pence
Engli&s;h. A Genoe&s;e collector, went to the hou&s;e
of a poor old woman, and demanded this trifling
&s;um, as the money for which &s;he was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
Being in extreme penury, &s;he had not wherewithal
to &s;atisfy the demand. Upon which, the collector
began to abu&s;e her, and to &s;eize &s;ome of her fur|niture.
She begged him to have patience, and
&s;aid, &s;he hoped in a few days to be able to pay
him. He per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;everity, and the poor
woman made a great lamentation. Two or three
people hearing the noi&s;e, entered the hou&s;e, took
the part of the woman, and exclaimed again&s;t the
barbarity of the collector. He threatened them
<PB N="122" REF="120">
with puni&s;hment, for having hindered him in the
execution of his office. This provoked the vil|lagers,
and they drove him away with &s;tones.
The Genoe&s;e &s;ent troops to &s;upport their collec|tor,
and the Cor&s;icans a&s;&s;embled in large bodies
to defend them&s;elves. The tumult encrea&s;ed.
A &s;park was &s;ufficient to kindle the generous
flame, in a people, who had &s;o often glowed with
the enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty; and in a very &s;hort
time, the whole i&s;land was in motion.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans immediately ru&s;hed upon the
capital, which they took almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance;
and they would have been ma&s;ters of the ca&s;tle of
Corte, had they been a little better regulated.</P>
<P>They &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to put them&s;elves
under the direction of certain chiefs. They there|fore
cho&s;e Signor Andrea Ceccaldi, one of the
highe&s;t nobility in the kingdom, and Signor Luiggi
Giafferi, not indeed of the fir&s;t rank, but who had
a number of relations, a &s;pirit, warm to a degree
of fanatici&s;m, again&s;t the republick, and the mo&s;t
&s;teady and undaunted re&s;olution. To the&s;e was
joined, Signor Domenico Raffalli, a worthy and
learned eccle&s;ia&s;tick, as a &s;ort of pre&s;ident of
ju&s;tice, who&s;e wi&s;dom might pre&s;erve order in their
admini&s;tration, and who&s;e religion might temper
the violence of their mea&s;ures, by principles of
con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="121">
The Genoe&s;e at fir&s;t endeavoured to overcome
the Cor&s;icans by the &s;ole force of the republick;
but finding them&s;elves altogether unable for it,
while the Cor&s;icans were every day growing
&s;tronger, cutting to pieces the poor reinforce|ments
of Genoe&s;e troops, and thereby &s;upplying
them&s;elves with more arms; the republick was
under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>They applied to the emperour, Charles the
&s;ixth, who &s;ent to Cor&s;ica, a body of auxiliaries,
under the command of general Wachtendonck.
The&s;e harra&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, without being power|ful
enough to overawe it. They had continual
rencounters with the Cor&s;icans, who, in one
action, killed 1200 of them. The emperour
then &s;ent a &s;trong army of Germans, with the
prince of Wirtemberg at their head. The Cor|&s;icans
were not in condition to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a force.
They laid down their arms, upon condition
that a treaty &s;hould be made between them and
the Genoe&s;e, having for guarantee the em|perour.</P>
<P>To this the republick having acceded, the
Cor&s;icans con&s;ented that their three chiefs, toge|ther
with Signor Aitelli, a pievano of great in|fluence,
&s;hould go to Genoa as ho&s;tages.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="122">
The&s;e were accordingly conducted thither,
dreading no violation of the promi&s;e of &s;afety
which had been made to them. The Ligurians
however, inclined to put them to death; and
their mini&s;ter at Vienna, had almo&s;t obtained the
emperour's con&s;ent; but the prince of Wirtem|berg,
who was afterwards killed at the battle of
Gua&s;talla, a prince of a brave and gallant &s;pirit,
&s;ent an expre&s;s to the emperour, with a very
&s;trong letter, repre&s;enting how much the honour
of Cae&s;ar would &s;uffer, &s;hould he con&s;ent to the
death of tho&s;e who had &s;urrendered them&s;elves
upon the faith of his &s;acred protection. This was
&s;econded by the generous interpo&s;ition of the
great prince Eugene of Savoy; and in&s;tructions
were &s;ent to Genoa, that the ho&s;tages &s;hould be
relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Giafferi and Aitelli went home to Cor&s;ica.
Ceccaldi went to Spain, where he died with the
rank of colonel; and Raffalli went to Rome,
where he remained till he became very old. He
then returned to end his days in his native coun|try,
where he &s;till lives, regarded with venera|tion.</P>
<P>The treaty which had been formally concluded
between the Cor&s;icans and the Genoe&s;e, having
been broken by the latter, there was a very &s;hort
<PB N="125" REF="123">
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities; and in 1734, the Cor|&s;icans
ro&s;e anew.</P>
<P>Giafferi was again elected a general, and got
for his collegue Signor Giacinto Paoli, father of
the pre&s;ent General.</P>
<P>Giacinto Paoli, was a Cor&s;ican gentleman of
a good family. But his merit di&s;tingui&s;hed him
more than his rank. He was a man of learning,
religion and bravery; well qualified to &s;erve his
country, either in politicks, or in war. The&s;e
chiefs were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a variety of pre&s;idents of
ju&s;tice, elected one after another.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e had paid very dear for their
victory, in their &s;truggles. It was computed,
that it had co&s;t them above thirty millions of
livres, be&s;ides co&s;tly pre&s;ents to the prince of
Wirtemberg, and to the other general officers.</P>
<P>The Marquis d'Argens very plea&s;antly applies
to the Genoe&s;e, the French fable of a gardener,
who complained to a gentleman in the neigh|bourhood,
that a hare came every day into his
garden, and eat his cabbages; and begged the
gentleman would be &s;o good, as drive her out
for him. The Gentleman comes with a pack of
hounds, and half-a-dozen hunt&s;men, and does
more mi&s;chief in five minutes, than the hare
could have done in &s;even years. After a prodi|gious
<PB N="126" REF="124">
chace, the hare made her e&s;cape through
a hole in the wall. Upon which the gentleman
congratulated the gardener on getting rid of his
enemy, and advi&s;ed him to &s;top up the hole<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lettres Juiv. lett. 34.</NOTE>.
So the Genoe&s;e, after having expended a great
deal more upon foreign auxiliaries, than any
advantage they can ever derive from Cor&s;ica;
upon the departure of the&s;e auxiliaries, have
the mortification to find them&s;elves ju&s;t as they
were.</P>
<P>Genoa again tried her force again&s;t Cor&s;ica;
but &s;he only &s;hewed her weakne&s;s, and bad po|liticks.
So much fallen was &s;he from that ad|venturous
&s;tate, which had formerly extended
her influence &s;o far. Genoa indeed, was unhap|pily
admini&s;tered. They relate, that the city of
Savona having rebelled &s;everal times, it was de|liberated
in the &s;enate, whether they ought not
to de&s;troy it altogether. When a witty &s;enator
of the Doria family, ro&s;e, and &s;aid, &startq;If that
be your intention, gentlemen, you need only
&s;end them &s;uch another governour, as the two
la&s;t were; you cannot fall on a better expe|dient.&endq;</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans on this occa&s;ion, di&s;played their
re&s;olution afre&s;h, in the cau&s;e of liberty. They
<PB N="127" REF="125">
were well conducted, and had many &s;ucce&s;sful
engagements with the Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P>Their noble enthu&s;ia&s;m always continued, and,
notwith&s;tanding many unlucky divi&s;ions among
them&s;elves, there were &s;till, in different parts of
the i&s;land, intrepid bands, animated by the ex|ample
of di&s;tingui&s;hed leaders.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here take notice of count Domenico
Rivarola. His family was a branch of the hou&s;e
of Ro&s;&s;i, at Parma, one of the mo&s;t ancient
and con&s;picuous of the Italian nobility. His an|ce&s;tor
had left his fief of Rivarola, in the ter|ritory
of Mantua, on account of the wars be|tween
the emperour, and the counte&s;s Matilda,
and had &s;ettled in the Genoe&s;e &s;tate, where he
quitted the name of Ro&s;&s;i, and took that of Ri|varola.
This family of Rivalora, greatly in|crea&s;ed.
In the fifteenth century, Francis Riva|rola
was, on account of long &s;ervices, rai&s;ed
to the dignity of a count Palatine, by the empe|rour
Maximilian; from which period, the title
has &s;ince been in the family. Several de&s;cendants
of Rivarola were e&s;tabli&s;hed in Spain, Sicily,
and the dominions of Sardinia, and three were
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Cor&s;ica, one in Calvi, one in
Ajaccio, and one in Ba&s;tia; of which la&s;t,
<PB N="128" REF="126">
count Domenico Rivarola was the repre&s;enta|tive.</P>
<P>This gentleman had the lands of Chiaveri,
on the river of Genoa; was con&s;idered as a friend
of the republick, and was intru&s;ted by her, with
the office of commi&s;&s;ary in Balagna; a &s;ingular
honour for a Cor&s;ican.</P>
<P>He endeavoured, at this time, to make a rea|&s;onable
accommodation between the Cor&s;icans
and Genoe&s;e, which having proved ineffectual,
he was convinced, that the republick was de|termined
to per&s;evere in tyranny; he therefore
embraced the patriotick party, and was ever
after, mo&s;t firm and zealous, in the great cau&s;e
of liberty. He quitted the i&s;land, and went over
to Leghorn, that he might be at full liberty
to negotiate upon the continent, in behalf of his
country.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e immediately confi&s;cated his lands
of Chiaveri. He had &s;till the lands of Oletta,
in Cor&s;ica; to which, he made his family re|move
from Ba&s;tia. But, he had &s;oon a very &s;e|vere
trial of his con&s;tancy. For, the &s;ame
year, his &s;on Antonio, who was &s;tudying at the
academy of Siena, went home, to bring with
him his brother Nicholas; and, as they were
cro&s;&s;ing over to Leghorn, in a little Tu&s;can
<PB N="129" REF="127">
ve&s;&s;el, with a Briti&s;h pa&s;&s;port, they were taken
by the republick, and carried to Genoa, where
they were thrown into pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The republick thought this would certainly
prevent count Domenico, the father, from con|tinuing
with the patriots. They offered to re|&s;tore
him his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to relea&s;e his &s;ons, and
to make him general of the Cor&s;ican troops in
their &s;ervice, if he would return to their &s;ide.
But he an&s;wered with re&s;olution and magnani|mity:
&startq;I miei figliuoli me li daranno a lor di&s;|petto;
e tutte le altre offerte le &s;timo un nul|la
a paragone del giu&s;to impegno che ho pre|&s;o
e che &s;eguiter&ograve; fin che ho vita. My &s;ons
they &s;hall be obliged to give me, whether they
will or no; and all their other offers I con&s;ider
as nothing, in compari&s;on of the ju&s;t enterpri&s;e
in which I am engaged, and in which I will
per&s;evere while I have life.&endq; Such in&s;tances of
patriotick &s;pirit de&s;erve to be recorded. The
annals of Cor&s;ica will furni&s;h many of them.</P>
<P>When the Au&s;trian troops entered Genoa,
the young counts Rivarola were &s;et at liberty.
Count Antonio, the elede&s;t, my very good
friend, is a major, in the &s;ervice of the king of
Sardinia, and con&s;ul general for that &s;overeign in
Tu&s;cany. Count Nicholas, the other, lives at
<PB N="130" REF="128">
Oletta in Cor&s;ica, but is of &s;o delicate a con&s;ti|tution,
that he cannot &s;erve his country as he
would wi&s;h to do. Both the brothers have the
&s;pirit of their father.</P>
<P>Count Domenico Rivarola obtained a regi|ment
in the Sardinian &s;ervice, and by his influ|ence
at Turin, procured &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he
would have been able to free his country, had
it not been for the hou&s;e of Matra in Cor&s;ica,
which &s;tood by the republick, and had intere&s;t
enough to make a &s;trong party in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Cor&s;ican war went on
with &s;pirit. Sometimes it was expected, that
the king of Spain would &s;trike in on one &s;ide
or other. But that prince did not choo&s;e to in|terfere.
Probably he fore&s;aw, that it would in|volve
him in a quarrel with France.</P>
<P>While the Genoe&s;e and the Cor&s;icans were
thus keenly engaged, and the politicians of Eu|rope
were forming various conjectures, a mo&s;t
extraordinary circum&s;tance occurred, to the a|mazement
of every body. This was the appear|ance
of Theodore, who&s;e &s;ingular &s;tory has made
&s;o much noi&s;e.</P>
<P>As many incon&s;i&s;tent reports have been cir|culated,
with regard to this man, I have been
at great pains to obtain authentick accounts con|cerning
<PB N="131" REF="129">
him, which, I am per&s;uaded, will be very
acceptable to my readers.</P>
<P>Theodore Baron Newhoff, in the county of
La Marc in We&s;tphalia, was the per&s;onage who
a&s;pired to the &s;overeignty of Cor&s;ica. He had
his education in the French &s;ervice. He after|wards
went to Spain, where he received &s;ome
marks of regard from the duke of Riperda and
cardinal Alberoni. But being of a &s;trange un&s;et|tled
projecting di&s;po&s;ition, he quitted Spain, and
went and travelled into Italy, England and Hol|land;
ever in &s;earch of &s;ome new adventure. He
at la&s;t fixed his attention on Cor&s;ica, and formed
a &s;cheme of making him&s;elf a king.</P>
<P>He was a man of abilities and addre&s;s; and,
after having fully informed him&s;elf of every thing
relating to the i&s;land, he went to Tunis, where he
fell upon means to procure &s;ome money and arms;
and then came to Leghorn, from whence he
wrote a letter to the Cor&s;ican chiefs, Giafferi and
Paoli, offering con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the nati|on,
if they would elect him as their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>This letter was con&s;igned to count Domenico
Rivarola, who acted as Cor&s;ican plenipotentiary,
in Tu&s;cany; and he gave for an&s;wer, that if Theo|dore
brought the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he promi&s;ed to the
<PB N="132" REF="130">
Cor&s;icans, they would very willingly make him
king.</P>
<P>Upon this he, without lo&s;s of time, &s;et &s;ail and
landed at Tavagna in &s;pring, 1736. He was a
man of a very &s;tately appearance; and the Tur|ki&s;h
dre&s;s which he wore, added to the dignity
of his mien. He had a few attendants with him.
His manners were &s;o engaging, and his offers &s;o
plau&s;ible, that he was proclaimed king of Cor&s;ica,
before count Rivarola's di&s;patches arrived to in|form
the chiefs of the terms upon which he had
agreed. He brought with him about a thou&s;and
zechins of Tunis, be&s;ides &s;ome arms and ammu|nition,
and made magnificent promi&s;es of foreign
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that the Cor&s;icans, who were glad
of any &s;upport, willingly gave into his &s;chemes;
and it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that there could be no
great harm in allowing a man the name of king,
&s;ince they had always the power of re&s;training his
authority.</P>
<P>Theodore a&s;&s;umed every mark of royal dig|nity.
He had his guards, and his officers of &s;tate.
He conferred titles of honour, and he &s;truck mo|ney,
both of &s;ilver and copper. The &s;ilver pieces
were few in number, and can now hardly be
met with. I have one of his copper coins, on one
&s;ide of it is &startq;T. R. (Theodorus Rex) King Theo|dore,&endq;
<PB N="133" REF="131">
with a double branch cro&s;&s;ed, and round it
this in&s;cription, &startq;Pro bono publico Re. Co. (Reg|ni
Cor&s;icae) For the public good of the kingdom
of Cor&s;ica.&endq; On the other &s;ide, is the value of
the piece, &startq;cinque &s;oldi, five &s;ous.&endq; There was &s;uch
a curio&s;ity over all Europe to have king Theo|dore's
coins, that his &s;ilver pieces were &s;old at four
zechins each; and when the genuine ones were
exhau&s;ted, imitations of them were made at Na|ples,
and, like the imitations of antiques, were
bought up at a high price, and carefully pre&s;erved
in the cabinets of the virtuo&s;i.</P>
<P>Theodore immediately blocked up the Ge|noe&s;e
fortified towns; and he u&s;ed to be &s;ome|times
at one &s;iege, &s;ometimes at another, &s;tanding
with a tele&s;cope in his hand, as if he &s;pied the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he &s;aid he expected. He u&s;ed
al&s;o the artifice of making large packets be con|tinually
brought to him from the continent, which
he gave out to be from the different &s;overeigns of
Europe, acknowledging his authority, and promi&s;|ing
to befriend him.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e were not a little confounded
with this unexpected adventurer. They publi&s;hed
a violent manife&s;to again&s;t Theodore, treating him
with great contempt, but at the &s;ame time &s;hew|ing,
that they were alarmed at his appearance.
Theodore replied, in a manife&s;to, with all the
<PB N="134" REF="132">
calmne&s;s and dignity of a monarch, expre&s;&s;ed his
indifference as to the injurious treatment of the
republick, and appeared firm in the hopes of vic|tory.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e mini&s;ter at London, made &s;trong
intere&s;t again&s;t the Cor&s;icans; and on the 24th of
July, 1736, her maje&s;ty, the queen regent of
Great Britain, i&s;&s;ued out her royal proclamation,
prohibiting any of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from fur|ni&s;hing
provi&s;ions or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the malecontents
of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>After having been about eight months in Cor|&s;ica,
Theodore perceived, that the people began
to cool in their affections towards him, and did
not act with the &s;ame re&s;olution as before. He
therefore wi&s;ely determined, to leave them for a
little, and try his fortune again upon the continent.
So, after having laid down a plan of admini&s;tra|tion,
to be ob&s;erved in his ab&s;ence, he quitted the
i&s;land, in the month of November.</P>
<P>He went to Holland, and there he was &s;uc|ce&s;sful
enough to get credit to a great extent,
from &s;everal rich merchants, particularly Jews,
who tru&s;ted him with cannon, and other warlike
&s;tores, to a great value, under the charge of a &s;u|percargo.
With the&s;e, he returned to Cor&s;ica, in
1739; and, on his arrival, he put to death his
<PB N="135" REF="133">
&s;upercargo, that he might not have any trouble
from demands being made upon him.</P>
<P>By this time, as &s;hall be afterwards &s;hewn, the
French had become &s;o powerful in the i&s;land,
that, although Theodore threw in his &s;upply of
warlke &s;tores, he did not incline to venture his
per&s;on, the Genoe&s;e having &s;et a high price upon
his head.</P>
<P>He therefore cho&s;e to relinqui&s;h his throne,
and give up his views of ambition for fafety, hav|ing
furni&s;hed a remarkable example, how far a
daring and de&s;perate &s;pirit may go. Had Theo|dore
had a little more prudence, and &s;ome better
fortune, he, and his po&s;terity, might have worn the
crown of Cor&s;ica, upon the generous title of hav|ing
delivered the i&s;land from oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It has often been &s;aid, that Theodore was &s;e|cretly
&s;upported by &s;ome of the European pow|ers.
But, from all that I can learn, there is no
foundation whatever, for this conjecture. It is,
indeed, a rare thing, to find a private gentleman
embarking on his own bottom, in an enterpri&s;e
of &s;uch a nature. But the truth is, Theodore was
a mo&s;t &s;ingular man, and had been &s;o beaten a|bout,
by change of fortune, that he had lo&s;t the
common &s;entiments of mankind, and viewed things
as one who is mad, or drunk, or in a fever. He
had nothing to lo&s;e, and a great deal to win. His
<PB N="136" REF="134">
&s;cheme was, to amu&s;e the Cor&s;icans with hopes
of foreign aid; and, by the force of hope, to car|ry
them foreward. This might have &s;ucceeded,
in which ca&s;e, he could very ea&s;ily have &s;aid, that
the foreign aid would have come, had there been
occa&s;ion for it; but they had behaved with &s;uch
&s;pirit, as to require no help. And, had he been
fortunate, it is probable, &s;ome of the powers of
Europe might have, in reality, &s;tood by him.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans now, talk differently of king
Theodore. Some of them, who had mo&s;t faith in
his fine &s;peeches, &s;till extoll him to the &s;kies, to
&s;upport their own judgement; others, who looked
upon him as an impo&s;tour, and never joined hear|tily
in his mea&s;ures, repre&s;ent him as a kind of
Wat Tyler, a king of a rabble; but the mo&s;t know|ing
and judicious, and the General him&s;elf, con&s;i|der
him in the moderate light in which he has
now been repre&s;ented, and own, that he was of
great &s;ervice in reviving the &s;pirit of the nation,
which, after a good many years of con&s;tant war,
was beginning to droop, but which, Theodore
re&s;tored, while he rekindled the &s;acred fire of li|berty.</P>
<P>They, indeed, are &s;en&s;ible, that his wretched
fate has thrown a &s;ort of ridicule on the nation,
&s;ince their king was confined in a jail at London,
which was actually the ca&s;e of poor Theodore;
<PB N="137" REF="135">
who, after experiencing the mo&s;t extraordinary
vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, cho&s;e to end his days in
our i&s;land of liberty; but was reduced to the
wretched &s;tate of a pri&s;oner, for debt.</P>
<P>Mr. Horace Walpole generou&s;ly exerted him|&s;elf
for Theodore. He wrote a paper in the
World, with greate elegance and humour, &s;oliciting
a contribution for the monarch in di&s;tre&s;s, to be
paid to Mr. Robert Dod&s;ley, book&s;eller, as lord
high trea&s;urer. This brought him a very hand|&s;ome
&s;um. He was allowed to get out of pri&s;on.
Mr. Walpole has the original deed, by which
Theodore made over the kingdome of Cor&s;ica, in
&s;ecurity to his creditors. He has al&s;o the great
&s;eal of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole has told me, that he had the
curio&s;ity to &s;ee king Theodore, and was accord|ingly
in company with him, at a lady's of his
acquaintance. But whether from dulne&s;s, or from
pride, he did not open his mouth.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he has been &s;o much dejected, and
&s;o much hurt by his misfortunes, that he was
become &s;ullen and indifferent. He died very &s;oon
after he got out of pri&s;on, and was buried in St.
Anne's church-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter; where a &s;imple,
unadorned monument in erected to him, with the
following in&s;cription:</P>
<LG>
<PB N="138" REF="136">
<L>Near this place, is interred</L>

</LG>
<P>To return to the affairs of the i&s;land. The
Genoe&s;e, eager to repre&s;s the ri&s;e in 1734, hir|ed
&s;ome Swi&s;s and Gri&s;ons, who from being
accu&s;tomed to &s;uch a country at home, might
&s;cour the mountains of Cor&s;ica. But the&s;e &s;ol|diers
found it no ea&s;y matter to &s;cour moun|tains,
where the natives were continually firing
upon them, and had numberle&s;s ways of e&s;cap|ing.
They &s;oon &s;aw that they had made a bad
bargain, and that they gave the Genoe&s;e too
much blood for their money.</P>
<P>Genoa had al&s;o recour&s;e to the de&s;perate expe|dient
of Marius and Sylla. She publi&s;hed an
<PB N="139" REF="137">
indemnity to all her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and outlaws of
every &s;ort, on condition that they &s;hould fight
for the republick, in Cor&s;ica. The robbers and
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of Genoa, are no incon&s;iderable propor|tion
of her people. The&s;e wretches flocked
together, from all quarters, and were formed into
twelve companies, who were joined with the Swi&s;s
and Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>It may well be believed, that venal &s;tipen|diaries,
and abandoned criminals, could not op|po&s;e
an army of brave men, who were fighting in
the great cau&s;e of liberty, and had every thing
that was dear to them, at &s;take.</P>
<P>But France, who has ever had an eye to this
i&s;land, now began to be apprehen&s;ive that the
Cor&s;icans might entirely throw off the yoke of
Genoa, in which ca&s;e, they would either become
a free &s;tate, which the powers of Europe would,
from a mutual jealou&s;y, protect, or perhaps, would
put them&s;elves under the &s;overeignty of &s;ome great
nation. She re&s;olved then to force them back
under the dominion of Genoa; for, by con&s;tant
negotiations with that republick, France has &s;uch
an a&s;cendancy, that &s;he may command, when &s;he
plea&s;es, whatever belongs to it.</P>
<P>A treaty was therefore made at Ver&s;ailles, by
which, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty engaged to re|duce
<PB N="140" REF="138">
the Cor&s;icans to obedience; and it was con|trived
with &s;uch addre&s;s, as to appear done at the
earne&s;t de&s;ire of Genoa; though in reality, the
republick had too recently experienced the danger
of calling in the aid of a great &s;tate, to wi&s;h for a
repetition of the &s;ame expedient.</P>
<P>In the month of March, 1738, the count de
Boi&s;&s;eux was &s;ent with a detachment of French
troops of Cor&s;ica. This general was a good offi|cer,
but of no great enterpri&s;e. He was attended
on this expedition, by M. de Contades, &s;ince,
mare&s;chal of France, who commanded the French
army, at the battle of Minden. After &s;everal con|ferences
with the chiefs of the Cor&s;icans, Giafferi
and Paoli, with whom we may al&s;o mention Lu|ca
di Omano, a collateral branch of the great
family, which Sampiero di Ba&s;telica formerly re|pre&s;ented,
M. de Boi&s;&s;eux finding that the Cor&s;i|cans
would not &s;ubmit to their old oppre&s;&s;ours,
began his ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>The people of Cor&s;ica remon&s;trated to his
mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty in a very affecting memo|rial,
in which they enumerated at great length
their grievances, and as France had formerly af|forded
them protection, they hoped &s;he would
not now compel them to yield to the wor&s;t of
tyranny. To the memorial were &s;ubjoined articles
<PB N="141" REF="139">
of accomodation, which they &s;ubmitted to the
French king.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles were thought too bold for a
people in the &s;ituation of the Cor&s;icans; and ar|ticles
formed by the Genoe&s;e were approved by
France: &s;o that no accommodation could be
brought about. Giafferi and Paoli publi&s;hed a &s;pi|rited
manife&s;to to their countrymen, concluding
it with the noble &s;entiment of Judas Maccabeus:
&startq;Melius e&s;t mori in bello quam videre mala gen|tis
no&s;trae<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Maccabees, chap. iii. ver. 59.</NOTE>. It is better for us to die in bat|tle,
than to behold the calamities of our people.&endq;</P>
<P>M. de Boi&s;&s;eux did con&s;iderable hurt to the
Cor&s;icans; for, although his operations were &s;low,
they were well conducted. He had even recour&s;e
to art; for he had a part of his troops dre&s;t exact|ly
like the people of the country, and, by that
device, they de&s;troyed multitudes, and occa&s;ioned
a &s;trange confu&s;ion and di&s;may among the Cor&s;i|cans,
in &s;o much, that till they came very near
parties, who appeared upon the mountains and in
the woods, they could not be certain whether
they were friends or enemies. Meanwhile, more
troops being &s;ent from France, the tran&s;ports
were overtaken with a terrible &s;torm, and &s;ome
of them wrecked on the Cor&s;ican coa&s;ts, where
<PB N="142" REF="140">
the patriots took the &s;oldiers pri&s;oners, and &s;eized
their arms. M. de Boi&s;&s;eux did not live to &s;ee the
&s;ucce&s;s of his operations. He was taken ill, and
died at Ba&s;tia, in February 1739.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e, much elated with the &s;ucce&s;s
that the monarchy of France had again&s;t the
Cor&s;icans, publi&s;hed a long memorial. The be|ginning
of it, is truly plea&s;ant: &startq;All the world
knows &s;o well, the mildne&s;s and love, with
which the republick of Genoa governs her
people; and above all, with what goodne&s;s and
affection &s;he hath ever regarded tho&s;e of Cor&s;i|ca,
&amp;c.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jau&s;&s;in, tom. i. p. 358.</NOTE>.&endq; They really intended this &s;hould
pa&s;s in Europe, as a &s;erious truth.</P>
<P>Still &s;upported by the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e,
the Cor&s;icans remained inflexible, nor would they
ever have given way, but to &s;uch a &s;uperiourity of
force, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to with&s;tand.</P>
<P>In March, 1739, the French &s;ent to Cor&s;ica,
the marquis de Maillebois, a commander eve|ry
way fitted for &s;uch an expedition, being an
officer of great penetration, and uncommon fire.
He &s;aw, that the Cor&s;icans had long been trifled
with by Genoa, and that even the French had
not acted again&s;t them with &s;ufficient vigour. He
&s;aw, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike a bold &s;troke,
<PB N="143" REF="141">
if he wanted to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the va|liant
i&s;landers, &s;o long accu&s;tomed to &s;cenes of
blood; and &s;ince his &s;overeign had committed to
him the charge of conquering this people, he re|&s;olved
to do it effectually.</P>
<P>Every thing therefore, was provided for the
enterpri&s;e. He had 16 battalions of the be&s;t
troops of France, be&s;ides &s;ome arquebu&s;iers, and
Bearnois, expert in climbing the mountains.</P>
<P>Having formed two great corps, and &s;everal
&s;mall parties, all compleatly furni&s;hed with am|munition,
and whatever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, or
convenient; he pierced into the innermo&s;t parts
of the country, while his grenadiers carried hea|vy
cannon acro&s;s the rude&s;t pa&s;&s;es. He cut down
the &s;tanding corn, the vines, the olives, &s;et fire
to the villages, and &s;pread terrour and de&s;olation
in every quarter. He hanged numbers of monks,
and others, who were keene&s;t in the revolt, and
at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed, wherever he went,
his terms of capitulation, which had the be&s;t
chance to be accepted, amid&s;t &s;o general a de|&s;truction.
Notwith&s;tanding the ungenerous
cau&s;e, in which they were di&s;played, one cannot
but admire the martial abilities of M. de Maille|bois.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="142">
We have &s;een, that Theodore dur&s;t not land.
The &s;uccours which he left, were not of much
avail. Such unprecedented, and terrible &s;laugh|ter,
as now took place, with the dread of &s;till
greater vengeance, from &s;o formidable a nation as
France, obliged the Cor&s;icans to lay down their
arms, at the end of the campaign, 1739, which
was indeed a hot one. Of the&s;e arms, a thou&s;and
were found to have the Genoe&s;e mark. The
republick demanded to have them re&s;tored, a cir|cum&s;tance
little to their honour.</P>
<P>The generals, Giafferi and Paoli, left the
i&s;land, and went to Naples; where they were
both made colonels, which character, they enjoy|ed
till their death.</P>
<P>There were &s;till &s;ome few enthu&s;ia&s;tick pa|triots,
who &s;kulked in the wilde&s;t parts of the
i&s;land; but the&s;e were all reduced before the end
of the year 1740, as was al&s;o the young ba|ron
Newhoff, the nephew of Theodore, who
with a &s;mall party of de&s;peradoes, had long
e&s;caped the utmo&s;t diligence of the French com|mander.
He &s;urrendered, on condition, that he
and his attendants, &s;hould be landed in &s;afety
on the continent, which was faithfully per|formed.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143">
In this manner was Cor&s;ica totally vanqui&s;h|ed
by France, of which the Genoe&s;e were as
proud, as if it had been their own atchieve|ment.
They gave in propo&s;als to M. de Maille|bois,
for keeping the i&s;land in perpetual quiet.
The&s;e propo&s;als are pre&s;erved by M. Jau&s;&s;in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jau&s;&s;in, tom. i. p. 468.</NOTE>;
and they are &s;uch, as any &s;tate &s;hould be a&s;hamed
of. Among&s;t many other barbarous &s;chemes,
one was, to tran&s;port a con&s;iderable number of
the inhabitants, and make them over to the
king of France, to people his di&s;tant colonies.
Could there be a more har&s;h, or a more ab&s;urd
mea&s;ure, than this? Jau&s;&s;in is much on the &s;ide
of Genoa, and through the whole of his two
volumes, does not &s;eem to have felt one &s;park
of true liberty, or at all to have entered into the
&s;pirit of what the Cor&s;icans were fighting for;
yet when he recites this propo&s;al, he cannot
help &s;aying: &startq;Il &s;embloit par l&agrave; qu'ils auroient
&eacute;t&eacute; contens d' etre &s;overains des &s;euls rochers
de Cor&s;e &s;ans &s;ujets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 481.</NOTE>. It would thence ap|pear,
that the Genoe&s;e would have been &s;atisfied
to be &s;overeigns of the bare rocks of Cor&s;ica,
without &s;ubjects.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="144">
France being engaged with more important
objects than Cor&s;ica, or any thing concerning the
Genoe&s;e, was no longer at lei&s;ure to employ her
attention on that i&s;land. All Europe being now
in agitation, &s;he thought proper to recall her
troops from Cor&s;ica. They accordingly quitted
the i&s;land, in the end of the year 1741, leaving
it in perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and quietne&s;s; as was &s;aid
of the Romans by Galgacus, the ancient Scotti&s;h
chief, in his famous &s;peech, upon the Grampian
mountains; &startq;Ubi &s;olitudinem faciunt, pacem ap|pellant

<P>The French, indeed, knew the Cor&s;icans too
well, to believe, that they would &s;ubmit to Ge|noa,
when left to them&s;elves. The event hap|pened
accordingly; for the French were hardly
gone, before the Cor&s;icans were again as much in
motion as ever. Several of their countrymen,
who were &s;ettled in different towns in Italy,
furni&s;hed them with arms; and, as they had
formerly done, they took a good many arms
from the Genoe&s;e. From having been long
depre&s;&s;ed, like a &s;trong bow recovering its ela|&s;ticity,
they ro&s;e with renewed vigour. Man,
<PB N="147" REF="145">
woman and child, may be &s;aid to have engaged;
for very young boys took the field; and even
&s;ome of their women, like tho&s;e of Sparta, &s;hew|ed
their valour in battle. Many of the religious
al&s;o carried arms; and, as if actuated by a kind of
univer&s;al in&s;piration, every &s;oul was ardent again&s;t
the tyrant.</P>
<P>Gaffori and Matra, now obtained the govern|ment
of Cor&s;ica, under the title of Protectours of
the kingdom. Gaffori was a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed
talents. His eloquence was mo&s;t remarkable; and
the Cor&s;icans &s;till talk with admiration of his ha|rangues
to them. He heard once, that a band of
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were coming again&s;t him. He went out,
and met them with a &s;erene dignity, which a&s;to|ni&s;hed
them. He begged they would only hear
him a little; and he gave them &s;o pathetick a pic|ture
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Cor&s;ica, and rou&s;ed their
&s;pirits to &s;uch a degree again&s;t tho&s;e, who cau&s;ed
the oppre&s;&s;ion, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins threw them&s;elves
at his feet, intreated his forgivene&s;s, and in&s;tantly
joined his banners.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle
of Corte, it was be&s;ieged with great vigour by the
Cor&s;icans, commanded by Gaffori. By a &s;trange
want of thought, the nur&s;e, who took care of
Gaffori's elde&s;t &s;on, then an infant, wandered a|way,
<PB N="148" REF="146">
at a little di&s;tance from the camp. The
Genoe&s;e perceived it, and making a &s;udden &s;ally,
they got hold of the nur&s;e and the child, and
carried them into the ca&s;tle. The General &s;he w|ed
a decent concern at this unhappy accident,
which &s;truck a damp into the whole army. The
Genoe&s;e thought they could have Gaffori upon
their own terms, &s;ince they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o
dear a pledge. When he advanced to make
&s;ome cannon play, they held up his &s;on, directly
over that part of the wall, again&s;t which his ar|tillery
was levelled. The Cor&s;icans &s;topt, and be|gan
to draw back; but Gaffori, with the re&s;oluti|on
of a Roman, &s;tood at their head, and ordered
them to continue the fire. Luckily, his firmne&s;s
was not broken by lo&s;ing his child, who e&s;caped
unhurt. I had the plea&s;ure of knowing the young
gentleman, who inherits his father's e&s;tate. He
related to me him&s;elf, from the be&s;t authority,
this &s;tory, which does &s;o much honour to his fa|ther.
I had it al&s;o vouched, by &s;uch as had no
particular intere&s;t in it.</P>
<P>Matra, the other general or protectour, was
always &s;u&s;pected, as &s;ecretly favouring the views
of Genoa, and was rather a promoter of divi|&s;ion,
than a patron of liberty. Indeed, the great
misfortune of the Cor&s;icans, was their want of
<PB N="149" REF="147">
union; which made particular animo&s;ities take
up their attention, and divert their zeal from the
great cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1745, Count Domenico Rivarola, arrived
at Ba&s;tia, along with &s;ome Engl&s;h &s;hiips of war.
Great Britain had forbidden her &s;ubjects to give
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Cor&s;icans; but, by the
changeful &s;chemes of political connexions, &s;he
con&s;ented to &s;end &s;ome &s;hips again&s;t the Genoe&s;e;
not, as if from her&s;elf, but, as complying with
the reque&s;t of her ally, the king of Sardinia,
who had taken the cau&s;e of Cor&s;ica much to
heart. The&s;e &s;hips bombarded Ba&s;tia, and San
Fiorenzo, both of which they delivered into the
hands of the Cor&s;icans. The force of the Bri|ti&s;h
men of war, and the great &s;ervice done by
us to their cau&s;e, are never forgotten, by the
brave i&s;landers.</P>
<P>Count Rivarola, was proclaimed Generali&s;&s;i|mo
of the kingdom. Gaffori and Matra, were
not pre&s;ent at this election, and did every thing
in their power to oppo&s;e it; &s;o that there was no|thing
but heart-burnings, and mi&s;erable di&s;&s;en|&s;ions;
and the Briti&s;h went away with an idea of
this people, as if they had been a parcel of
half-barbarians.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="148">
As our information, with regard to Cor&s;ica,
has been very imperfect, the&s;e unhappy impre&s;|&s;ions
have continued ever &s;ince, and have had too
much influence in Great Britain.</P>
<P>Rivarola, Gaffori, and Matra, having at length
come to a tolerable agreement, matters went on
a little better, though the Genoe&s;e &s;oon recovered
Ba&s;tia and San Fiorenzo.</P>
<P>In 1746, the Cor&s;icans &s;ent two envoys, with
propo&s;als to the Earl of Bri&s;tol, then his Britan|nick
Maje&s;ty's amba&s;&s;adour, at the court of Tu|rin.
The intention of the&s;e propo&s;als was, that
Cor&s;ica &s;hould put her&s;elf entirely under the pro|tection
of Great Britain. The envoys waited at
Turin, till My Lord Bri&s;tol had a return from
the mini&s;try at London, &s;ignifying their &s;atisfac|tion
at what had been communicated, hoping the
Cor&s;icans would pre&s;erve the &s;ame obliging &s;en|timents;
but that it was not then the time to
enter into any treaty with them.</P>
<P>Count Domenico Rivarola, finding that he
could be of mo&s;t &s;ervice to his country, when at
a di&s;tance, returned to Turin, where he con|&s;tantly
improved the benevolent intentions of his
Sardinian Maje&s;ty towards Cor&s;ica. He died
with the rank of colonel, in April 1748, and
<PB N="151" REF="149">
left behind him the character of an hone&s;t man,
and a gallant patriot.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month and year, the Briti&s;h &s;hip,
the Na&s;&s;au, commanded by captain Holcomb,
together with &s;ome tran&s;ports, carried over to
Cor&s;ica, two battalions, one of the king of
Sardinia's troops, and one of Au&s;trians, in or|der
to aid the Cor&s;icans; but the general peace
being concluded, at Aix la Chapelle, no foreign
&s;tates could any longer interfere, and the Cor&s;i|cans
and Genoe&s;e, were again left to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>My Lord Hailes has, among his valuable col|lection
of hi&s;torical manu&s;cripts, two pieces re|lating
to Cor&s;ica. The one entitled, &startq;Informa|tion
de l'&eacute;tat dans leqel &s;e trouve pre&s;entement la
Cor&s;e, &amp; de ce qu'il faudroit pour la delivrer de
l'e&s;clavage du gouvernement Genois, traduit de
l'Italien,&endq; is written by Count Domenico Riva|rola.
The other, is an account of the &s;tate of
Cor&s;ica, in the original Italian; drawn up by
one, who appears to have been well acquainted
with the &s;ubject. Both of the&s;e papers &s;et
forth, the advantages to be derived to a maritime
power, from an alliance with Cor&s;ica. They
were communicated by M. Carret de Gorregne,
the Sardinian mini&s;ter, to general Wentworth,
the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;adour, at the court of Turin
<PB N="152" REF="150">
and, I believe, they had con&s;iderable influence,
in procuring the interpo&s;ition of Sardinia and
Great Britain, in favour of the Cor&s;icans.</P>
<P>Matra, in the end of the year 1748, went to
the &s;ervice of Piedmont, and left Gaffori &s;ole ge|neral
of the i&s;land. A repetition of the &s;ame de|&s;perate
actions continued, till on the 3d of Oc|tober,
1753, Gaffori was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by a band
of murderers, &s;et on by the republick. At lea&s;t,
it is a fact that &s;ome of the&s;e wretches have &s;till a
mi&s;erable pen&s;ion to &s;upport them, in the terri|tory
of Genoa. There is a pillar of infamy
erected at Corte, on the place, where &s;tood the
hou&s;e of the principal actour in this bloody villa|ny.
The hou&s;e was burnt, and razed from the
foundation.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans, from their family connexions,
and violent parties, differ in their accounts of
Gaffori. Some of them would have it believed,
that he was too much engro&s;&s;ed by &s;elfi&s;h views,
and in order to promote his own intere&s;t, endea|voured
to bring about unworthy &s;chemes of recon|ciliation
with Genoa. But, be&s;ides the reluct|ance
which every generous mind mu&s;t feel, to
give credit to injurious reports of a hero, who&s;e
greatne&s;s of &s;oul &s;hone forth, in the manner I
have related, what I heard of Gaffori from tho&s;e,
<PB N="153" REF="151">
in who&s;e judgment and impartiality I could con|fide,
joined with the regard with which he is had
in remembrance by the majority of his country|men,
determine me to a per&s;ua&s;ion of the reality
of his virtues.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tratours of the i&s;land had been &s;o
well in&s;tituted by general Gaffori, that Cor&s;ica
was able to continue for two years without any
chief; while the war was &s;till carried on with va|rious
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The patriots did not however, &s;wear a &s;olemn
oath, that, rather than &s;ubmit to the republick,
they would throw them&s;elves into the fire, like
the Saguntines of old. This oath, which is con|ceived
in terms of &s;trength and violence, not un|like
the Cor&s;ican &s;tile, but &s;omewhat exaggerated,
was circulated over Europe, and generally be|lieved
to be genuine. Doctour Smollet, who
di&s;plays a generous warmth in favour of the Cor|&s;icans,
was very naturally led to give this oath a
place in his hi&s;tory<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Smoll. hi&s;t. vol. XVI. p. 384.</NOTE>; but Paoli a&s;&s;ures me,
that it was a fiction.</P>
<P>I come now, to a remarkable event in the an|nals
of Cor&s;ica, an event, from which the hap|pine&s;s
and glory of that i&s;land will principally be
<PB N="154" REF="152">
dated. I mean, the election of Pa&s;cal Paoli, to
be General of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal Paoli<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His name, in Italian, is Pa&s;quale de' Paoli. I write Pa&s;cal, as more agreeable to an Engli&s;h ear. I al&s;o avoid giv|ing him any title. I owe this thought to My Lord Hailes. When I a&s;ked him, Whether I &s;hould call Paoli, Signor, or General? his an&s;wer was, &startq;Signor is better than Gene|ral, but plain Pa&s;cal is better than either. You do not &s;ay, King Alexander, but Alexander of Macedon; no title adds to the dignity of Judas Maccabeus.&endq;</NOTE>, was &s;econd &s;on to the old
chief Giacinto Paoli. He had been educated
with great care by his father, who formed his
ta&s;te for letters, and in&s;pired him with every wor|thy
and noble &s;entiment. He was born in Cor&s;i|ca,
where he remained long enough, to contract
a love and attachment to his country, and to feel
the oppre&s;&s;ion under which it groaned.</P>
<P>When the patriots were totally cru&s;hed by the
marquis de Maillebois, his father took young
Paoli to Naples, where he had the advantage of
attending the academy, got a commi&s;&s;ion as an
officer in that &s;ervice, and was much about court.</P>
<P>Here he lived twelve or thirteen years, culti|vating
the great powers with which nature had
endowed him, and laying the foundation of tho&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="153">
grand de&s;igns, which he had early formed, for
the deliverance of his country.</P>
<P>His reputation became &s;o great among the Cor|&s;icans,
that he received the &s;tronge&s;t invitations
to come over and take the command. He em|barked
in the glorious enterpri&s;e, &s;timulated by
generous ambition, and undi&s;mayed by a con&s;i|deration
of the dangers, the cares, and the un|certainty
which he was about to encounter.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething particularly affecting, in
his parting from his father; the old man, hoary
and gray with years, fell on his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed
him, gave him his ble&s;&s;ing, and with a broken
feeble voice, encouraged him in the undertaking,
on which he was entering: &startq;My &s;on,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;I may, po&s;&s;ibly, never &s;ee you more; but in
my mind, I &s;hall ever be pre&s;ent with you.
Your de&s;ign is a great, and a noble one; and I
doubt not, but GOD will ble&s;s you in it. The
little which remains to me of life, I will allot to
your cau&s;e, in offering up my prayers and &s;up|plications
to heaven, for your protection and
pro&s;perity.&endq; Having again embraced him, they
parted.</P>
<P>Pa&s;cal Paoli no &s;ooner appeared in the i&s;land,
than he attracted the attention of every body.
His carriage and deportment prejudiced them in
his favour, and his &s;uperiour judgment, and pa|triotick
<PB N="156" REF="154">
&s;pirit, di&s;played with all the force of elo|quence,
charmed their under&s;tandings. All this,
heightened with conde&s;cen&s;ion, affability and
mode&s;ty, entirely won him their hearts. A way
was open for him to the &s;upreme command, and
he was called to it by the unanimous voice of his
countrymen; upon which occa&s;ion, was i&s;&s;ued
the following manife&s;to.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Supreme, and General Council of the King|dom
of CORSICA, to the Beloved people of that
NATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BELOVED PEOPLE AND COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;THE di&s;cords and divi&s;ions, that have begun
to infect the publick, as well as private tranquil|lity
of our country, by the revival of ancient,
and per&s;onal enmities among&s;t tho&s;e, who have
very little fear of GOD, and are little intere&s;ted
and zealous, for the good of the publick, have
obliged our principal chiefs to call us together,
to this general Con&s;ulta, in order to deliberate
on &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, as may effectually
contribute to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a common
union, and to cau&s;e the mo&s;t rigid laws to be
put in execution, again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hall dare to
<PB N="157" REF="155">
di&s;turb it by their private piques, or unruly di&s;|po&s;itions.&endq;</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper and effectual means, to &s;uc|ceed
in this our de&s;irable end,&startq; are by us &s;eri|ou&s;ly
thought to be, the electing of one oeco|nomical,
political and general chief, of enlight|ened
faculties, to command over this kingdom
with full power, except when there &s;hall be oc|ca&s;ion
to con&s;ult upon matters concerning the
&s;tate, which he cannot treat of, without the
concurrence of the people, or their re&s;pective
repre&s;entatives.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By the general voice is elected for that tru&s;t,
Pa&s;cal Paoli; a man, who&s;e virtues and abili|ties,
render him every way worthy thereof.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;After &s;o general an election, by the chiefs of
the council of war, the deputies of the pro|vinces,
and the re&s;pective repre&s;entatives of the
pari&s;hes a&s;&s;embled, this gentleman was invited,
by a letter, to come; and a large committee of
the principal members of the a&s;&s;embly, was
&s;ent to his hou&s;e, to de&s;ire him to accept of the
charge, and to repair hither to be acknowledg|ed
as our chief; and to take the &s;olemn oath, to
exerci&s;e the office, with which he is inve&s;ted,
with the utmo&s;t zeal, affection and di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s;
<PB N="158" REF="156">
and to receive the oath of fidelity and
obedience from the commons.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be&s;ides having given many rea&s;ons again&s;t
this, he has &s;hewn much reluctance to take up|on
him &s;o great a charge; but having been in|formed
of our re&s;olutions and determinations, in
ca&s;e of any ob&s;tacle or refu&s;al, he was obliged
to acquie&s;ce, being nece&s;&s;itated &s;o to do. He
was conducted hither la&s;t night, and hath
plighted and received the oaths above-men|tioned.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is to take the government upon him&s;elf,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, and one
of the mo&s;t reputable per&s;ons from each pro|vince,
who &s;hall be changed every month.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The third day of Augu&s;t &s;hall be fixed on,
for a general circuit, in order to puni&s;h the
authours of many crimes, particularly murders,
committed lately in different parts. This cir|cuit,
to be directed by the afore&s;aid General,
with the deputies. The number of armed men,
as he &s;hall think fitting.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We hope, that the&s;e our re&s;olutions and de|liberations,
will be to the general &s;atisfaction,
as it concerns the common good: and we
charge all the chiefs and commi&s;&s;aries over
<PB N="159" REF="157">
the pari&s;hes, to co-operate, as far as lies in
their power, to promote the publick tranquil|lity.&endq;</P>
<P>Dated at St. Antonio of the White Hou&s;e,
this 15th of July, 1755.</P>
<P>Though Paoli had long meditated on the im|portance
of the charge he was to enter upon, its
near approach &s;truck him with awe; for his ideas
were enlarged, his re&s;olves were magnanimous,
and the office appeared more momentous to
him, than it could appear to one of more con|fined
views, and more moderate plans.</P>
<P>His he&s;itation and diffidence, when called to
the &s;upreme command, was not affected. He
balanced the con&s;equences, and he could not
but be &s;eriou&s;ly moved. For he could not di|vine
with certainty, the a&s;toni&s;hing influence
which his government was to have, on the hap|pine&s;s
of his country. But the repre&s;entations
made to him, were &s;o earne&s;t, and, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, &s;o peremptory, that he thought him|&s;elf
bound in duty to accept of the arduous
ta&s;k.</P>
<P>When he enquired into the &s;ituation of the
affairs of Cor&s;ica, he found the utmo&s;t di&s;order
and confu&s;ion. There was no &s;ubordination, no
<PB N="160" REF="158">
di&s;cipline, no money, hardly any arms and am|munition;
and, what was wor&s;e than all, little
union among the people. He immediately began
to remedy the&s;e defects. His per&s;ua&s;ion and ex|ample,
had wonderful force; all ranks exerted
them&s;elves, in providing what was nece&s;&s;ary for
carrying on the war with &s;pirit; whereby, in a
&s;hort time, the Genoe&s;e were driven to the re|mote&s;t
corners of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Having thus expelled the foe, from the bo|&s;om
of his country, he had lei&s;ure to attend to
the civil part of the admini&s;tration, in which he
di&s;covered abilities and con&s;tancy hardly to be
paralleled. He rectified innumerable abu&s;es,
which had in&s;inuated them&s;elves, during the late
times of trouble and confu&s;ion. He, in a man|ner,
new-modelled the government, upon the
founde&s;t principles of democratical rule, which
was always his favourite idea.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans having been long denied legal
ju&s;tice, had a&s;&s;umed the right of private revenge,
and had been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate each other
upon the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions. He found it ex|tremely
difficult to break them of this practice,
by which it was computed, that the &s;tate lo&s;t
800 &s;ubjects every year. The di&s;ea&s;e was be|come
<PB N="161" REF="159">
&s;o violent, that it &s;eemed almo&s;t incurable.
However, by &s;ea&s;onable admonition, by repre|&s;enting
to them the ruin of this practice to the
cau&s;e of liberty, at a time when they had occa|&s;ion
for all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could lend to each
other, joined to a &s;trict exerci&s;e of criminal ju&s;|tice;
he gradually brought them to be convin|ced,
that the power of di&s;pen&s;ing puni&s;hment be|longed
to the publick; and that, without a pro|per
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and a regular &s;y&s;tem of admini|&s;tration,
they never could make head again&s;t an
enemy, or, indeed, be properly &s;peaking, a &s;tate.
So effectual were the mea&s;ures he took, that a
law was pa&s;&s;ed, making a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination capital, let
it be committed on any pretence whatever.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans are naturally humane; but,
like the Italians, and mo&s;t &s;outhern nations, are
extremely violent in their trempers. This is cer|tainly
the effect of a warm climate, which forms
the human frame to an exqui&s;ite degree of &s;en&s;ibi|lity.
Whatever advantages this &s;en&s;ibility may
produce, by cheri&s;hing the finer feelings and
more exalted affections; it is at the &s;ame time
productive of &s;ome di&s;advantages, being equally
the occa&s;ion of impatience, &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, and a
&s;pirit of revenge, tending to the di&s;order of
&s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="160">
Paoli, by his ma&s;terly knowledge of human
nature, guided the Cor&s;icans to glory, and ren|dered
the impetuo&s;ity of their di&s;po&s;itions, and
their pa&s;&s;ion for revenge, &s;ub&s;ervient to the noble
objects of liberty, and of vindicating their coun|try.
His wi&s;e in&s;titutions had &s;o good an effect,
that notwith&s;tanding of their frequent lo&s;&s;es in
action, it was found, that in a few years; the
number of inhabitants was increa&s;ed 16000.</P>
<P>When a proper &s;y&s;tem of government was
formed, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t glaring abu&s;es rec|tified,
Paoli proceeded to improve and civilize the
manners of the Cor&s;icans. This was a very de|licate
ta&s;k. They had been brought up in anar|chy,
and their con&s;tant virtue had been re&s;i&s;tance.
It therefore, required the nice&s;t conduct, to make
them di&s;cern the difference between &s;alutary re|&s;traint
and tyrannick oppre&s;&s;ion. He was no mo|narch,
born to rule, and who received a nation
as a patrimonial inheritance. It was, therefore,
in vain to think of acting with force, like the
Czar Peter towards the Ru&s;&s;ians. It was not, in|deed,
con&s;i&s;tent with his views of forming a free
nation; but, had he been inclined to it, he could
not have executed &s;uch a plan. He was entirely
dependant upon the people, elected by them,
and an&s;werable to them for his conduct. It was no
ea&s;y matter to re&s;train tho&s;e of whom he held
his power. But this, Paoli accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="161">
He gradually prepared the Cor&s;icans for the
reception of laws, by cultivating their minds, and
leading them, of their own accord, to de&s;ire the
enactment of regulations, of which he &s;hewed
them the benefit. He e&s;tabli&s;hed an univer&s;ity at
Corte; and he was at great pains to have proper
&s;chools, for the in&s;truction of children, in every
village of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;tep he took was, to induce the Cor|&s;icans
to apply them&s;elves to agriculture, com|merce,
and other civil occupations. War had
entirely ruined indu&s;try in the i&s;land. It had given
the Cor&s;icans a contempt for the arts of peace;
&s;o that they thought nothing worthy of their at|tention,
but arms and military achievements.
The great and valourous actions, which many of
them had performed, gave them a certain pride,
which di&s;dained all meaner and more inglorious
occupation. Heroes could not &s;ubmit to &s;ink
down into plain pea&s;ants. Their virtue was not
&s;o perfect, as that of the ancient Romans, who
could return from the triumphs of victory, to
follow their ploughs.</P>
<P>From the&s;e cau&s;es, the country was a danger
of being entirely uncultivated, and the people of
becoming of a lawle&s;s and ungovernable rabble of
banditti.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="162">
Paoli therefore, &s;et him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to guard
again&s;t this; and by degrees, brought the Cor|&s;icans
to look upon labour with le&s;s aver&s;ion, &s;o
as at lea&s;t to provide them&s;elves &s;ufficiently in
food and clothing, and to carry on a little com|merce.</P>
<P>His admini&s;tration, in every re&s;pect was &s;uch,
that, from being rent into factions, the nation
became firm and united; and had not France
again interpo&s;ed, the Cor&s;ican heroes would long
before this time have totally driven the Genoe&s;e
from the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Feeling its own importance, the Cor&s;ican na|tion
re&s;olved to give the Genoe&s;e no quarter at &s;ea,
which they had hitherto done, out of indulgence
to the individuals of the republick; lamenting
their unhappy &s;ituation, which obliged them to
live under a tyrannical government. But finding
that the Genoe&s;e continually attacked, and made
booty of the Cor&s;ican ve&s;&s;els, it was thought
highly equitable to retaliate; pre&s;erving at the
&s;ame time, all due re&s;pect for the other maritime
powers. To this effect, a manife&s;to was i&s;&s;ued
in 1760<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e firm and rapid advances of the Cor&s;i|can
nation, filled the Genoe&s;e with &s;erious con|cern;
and in 1761, they publi&s;hed a manife&s;to

<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Immediately upon this, a general council
was a&s;&s;embled at Ve&s;covato in Ca&s;inca, where
the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olutions were taken, never to
make any agreement with the republick, but on
condition of having Cor&s;ica &s;ecured in its liber|ties
and independency<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A memorial was al&s;o publi&s;hed by the Cor|&s;icans,
to the &s;overeigns of Europe<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o. IV.</NOTE>, calling
upon them, by the rights of humanity, to in|terpo&s;e,
and give peace to a nation which had
done &s;o much for freedom.</P>
<P>In the&s;e various writings, there is a &s;pirit of
eloquence, a feeling, and a re&s;olution, which
does honour to the character of this people.</P>
<P>But the politicks of Ver&s;ailles did not favour
the Cor&s;ican cau&s;e; France has been alternately,
the &s;courage and the &s;hield of Genoa. Paoli had
well nigh compleatly fini&s;hed his great &s;cheme of
freeing every part of the i&s;land from the Genoe&s;e,
when a treaty was concluded between France and
the republick, by which the former engaged to
&s;end &s;ix battalions of troops to garri&s;on the forti|fied
towns in Cor&s;ica, for the &s;pace of four years.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="164">
When this treaty was fir&s;t known in Europe,
every noble heart was afflicted; for every body
believed, that France was again determined to
carry fire and &s;word into Cor&s;ica, and bla&s;t the
hopes of the brave i&s;landers. M. Rou&s;&s;eau wrote
of it, with his u&s;ual energy, to his friend and
mine, M. De Leyre, at Parma; one of the au|thours
of the Encyclopedie, a man who unites
with &s;cience and genius the mo&s;t amiable heart and
mo&s;t generous &s;oul: &startq;Il faut avouer que vos
Fran&ccedil;ois, &s;ont un peuple bien &s;ervile, bien ven|du

be owned that your countrymen, the French,
are a very &s;ervile nation, wholly &s;old to ty|ranny,
exceedingly cruel and relentle&s;s in
per&s;ecuting the unhappy. If they knew of
a free man at the other end of the world, I
believe they would go thither for the mere

<P><PB N="167" REF="165">
But it turned out to be a prudent and poli|tick
&s;cheme on the part of France. She was
owing the Genoe&s;e &s;ome millions of livres.
Her finances were not &s;uch as made it very con|venient
for her to pay. But the French mi|ni&s;ters
are never at a lo&s;s to conclude an advan|tageous
treaty for their monarch. They told
the Genoe&s;e, &startq;We cannot yet let you have your
money. But we will &s;end you &s;ix battalions
of auxiliaries to Cor&s;ica, and let that be a &s;ink|ing
fund for the di&s;charge of our debt.&endq; The
Genoe&s;e, who recalled with barbarous &s;atisfac|tion
what France had formerly done again&s;t
the Cor&s;icans, never doubted, that if French
&s;oldiers were again in the i&s;land, continual
&s;kirmi&s;hes would en&s;ue; France would be
provoked, and a bloody war would be the
con&s;equence, by which the Cor&s;icans would a|gain
be reduced to a &s;tate of &s;lavery. They were
therefore extremely plea&s;ed with the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>The French, however, took care to engage
to act only on the defen&s;ive, and to fix the trea|ty
for four years, that they might be &s;ure of
having time to &s;ink their debt. They &s;ent the
troops as &s;tipulated in the end of the year 1764;
<PB N="168" REF="166">
and the Count De Marboeuf was appointed com|mander
in chief.</P>
<P>M. De Marboeuf was an officer of experience
and temper; and, no doubt, and his in&s;truc|tions
to conduct him&s;elf mildly towards the Cor|&s;icans.
All his duty was, to take care that
things &s;hould not become wor&s;e for Genoa; but,
that &s;he &s;hould &s;till retain the garri&s;on towns of
Ba&s;tia, San Fiorenzo, Calvi, Algagliola and
Ajaccio.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans conducted them&s;elves, upon
this occa&s;ion, with the greate&s;t propriety. A
general council was held, and determinations
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix N^o. V.</NOTE> publi&s;hed; from which it appears, that they
&s;hewed no di&s;tru&s;t of the French, who, they
tru&s;ted, would not begin ho&s;tilities again&s;t them.
But, for greater &s;ecurity, it was provided, that
a council of war &s;hould be appointed by the
government, to be ever vigilant again&s;t any in|fractions
of what they &s;uppo&s;ed France had ta|citly
promi&s;ed to them, and was bound by the
law of nations to ob&s;erve; that the French troops
&s;hould not be allowed to have acce&s;s to the ter|ritories
of the nation; that the General &s;hould
<PB N="169" REF="167">
po&s;t &s;ufficient guards upon the frontiers; and
if any French officer de&s;ired a pa&s;sport, he
might grant him it; but &s;hould be obliged
to give an account, in the fir&s;t general con|&s;ulta
thereafter, of what pa&s;sports he had grant|ed;
of his motives for granting them; and
of every treaty he &s;hould have with the French.
That, as it was reported, &s;ome new propo|&s;als
of peace with the republick would be of|fered,
they &s;hould reject all &s;uch, if they did
not fir&s;t grant to the nation, the preliminaries
re&s;olved upon in the general council of Ca|&s;inca.
That the General &s;hould make a re&s;|pectful
remon&s;trance, in name of the nation,
to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, with regard
to the lo&s;s it mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain by the arrival of his
troops; by which, the Genoe&s;e would be re|lieved
of the great expence of the Cor&s;ican
war, and the patriots be prevented from con|tinuing
their &s;ucce&s;sful enterpri&s;es, and totally
expelling their enemies from the i&s;land. That
this remon&s;trance might be more effectual, his
excellency &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, apply
to the powers favourable to Cor&s;ica, that they
might employ their mediation with the French
king, in order to pre&s;erve to the nation its
<PB N="170" REF="168">
rights, prerogatives, liberty and independen|cy.
And they further ordered, that as every
body had, without controul, cut timber in
the woods of Cor&s;ica, they &s;hould be prohibited
&s;o to do, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment.</P>
<P>The&s;e determinations were wi&s;e and mode|rate.
Without giving umbrage to the French,
they &s;ecured the patriots from &s;udden attacks,
or in&s;idious wiles. The article relating to
the cutting of timber, was e&s;&s;entially requi|&s;ite
to prevent the French from carrying it
away to Mar&s;eilles and Toulon; which they,
probably, would have done, had it not been
for this edict, which pre&s;erved to the Cor&s;i|cans
a noble &s;upply of wood, to be ready, either
for their own &s;ervice, or for the &s;ervice of any
maritime power, with whom they might make
an alliance.</P>
<P>The warlike operations of Cor&s;ica were now
&s;u&s;pended. But Paoli improved the &s;ea&s;on
of tranquillity to the be&s;t purpo&s;e, in pre|paring
for future &s;chemes of victory, and in
giving perfection and &s;tability to the civil
con&s;titution of his country; effectuating what

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pre&s;ent State of CORSICA, with re&s;pect to
Government, Religion, Arms, Commerce, Learn|ing,
the Genius and Character of its INHABI|TANTS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER running over the revolutions of an
i&s;land, which has experienced &s;o many vi|ci&s;&s;itudes,
it will be agreeable to con&s;ider the re|&s;ult
of the&s;e vigorous exertions in the cau&s;e of
liberty. I &s;hall, therefore, with much plea&s;ure,
pre&s;ent my readers with the &s;tate of Cor&s;ica as it
now is.</P>
<P>The Government of Cor&s;ica is, as follows.
Every pae&s;e or village, elects, by majority of
votes, a Pode&s;t&agrave; and other two magi&s;trates, who
have the re&s;pectable name of &startq;Padri del Com|mune;
Fathers of the Community.&endq; The&s;e ma|gi&s;trates
are cho&s;en annually. They may be con|tinued
in office for &s;everal years, at the will of
the community; but there mu&s;t be a new elec|tion
every year.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="171">
The Pode&s;t&agrave;, by him&s;elf, may determine
cau&s;es to the value of ten livres; and united with
the Padri del Commune, may finally determine
cau&s;es to the value of thirty livres. The Pode&s;t&agrave;
is the repre&s;entative of the government, and to
him are addre&s;&s;ed all the orders of the &s;upreme
council. The Padri del Commune &s;uperintend
the oeconomy and police of the village, call the
people together, and con&s;ult with them on every
thing that concerns their intere&s;t. In &s;ome vil|lages,
the inhabitants join with the Pode&s;t&agrave; and
Padri del Commune, twelve hone&s;t men, in
whom they can confide, and to whom they dele|gate
their power of &s;ettling the affairs of the pu|blick.
The&s;e are called coun&s;ellors, and &s;it as
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with the three magi&s;trates of the village.
The names of the&s;e Magi&s;trates, as &s;oon as elect|ed,
mu&s;t be tran&s;mitted to the magi&s;trates of the
province, who have it in their power to oppo&s;e
the choice, and order a new election; but this
never happens when the people have been unani|mous.
Sometimes they choo&s;e two Pode&s;t&agrave;s and
one Padre del Commune, and &s;ometimes more
and &s;ometimes fewer coun&s;ellors. The&s;e irre|gularities
are permitted, to humour the caprices
of different villages in an infant &s;tate, and are of
no con&s;equence; for the &s;ame degree of power
<PB N="175" REF="172">
remains to each office, whether it be held by
a le&s;&s;er or a greater number; as in the &s;tates of
Holland, tho&s;e who &s;end two or three repre&s;en|tatives,
have but an equal voice with tho&s;e who
&s;end only one. In &s;ome of the more con&s;iderable
towns, the Pode&s;t&agrave; is not &s;ubject to the provin|cial
magi&s;trates, but is con&s;idered as having equal
authority with them.</P>
<P>Once a year, all the inhabitants of each vil|lage
a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves and choo&s;e a Procura|tour,
to repre&s;ent them in the general con&s;ulta
or parliament of the nation, which is held an|nually
in the month of May, at the city of
Corte. This procuratour is elected by the ma|jority
of the voices. He mu&s;t have a mandate,
atte&s;ted by a notary publick, which, on his ar|rival
at Corte, he pre&s;ents to the great chancel|lor
of the kingdom, by whom it is regi&s;tered.
Each procuratour has, from his community, a
livre a day, to bear his charges from the time of
his &s;etting out till his return home. This al|lowance
is too &s;mall, and mu&s;t &s;oon be in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sometimes the procuratours of all the villages,
contained in the &s;ame pieve, choo&s;e from among
them&s;elves one who goes as repre&s;entative of the
pieve, which &s;aves &s;ome expence to the villages.
<PB N="176" REF="173">
But this is an abu&s;e, and when matters of any
con&s;equence are deliberating, it renders the num|ber
of tho&s;e who are to con&s;ult too &s;mall. A
little expence &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed, in compari&s;on
of having a voice in making the laws, and &s;ettling
the mo&s;t &s;erious affairs of the country; and the
greater the number of voices, the more does the
a&s;&s;embly approach to the idea of a Roman
comitia.</P>
<P>The general con&s;ulta is, indeed, a great and
numerous a&s;&s;embly; for, be&s;ides the ordinary
procuratours, it is u&s;ual to call in &s;everal of tho&s;e
who have formerly been members of the &s;upreme
council, and &s;everal of tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their
fathers of near relations in the &s;ervice of their
country, that the blood of heroes may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by publick honours.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates of each province al&s;o &s;end a
procuratour to the general con&s;ulta; and when
all the procuratours are a&s;&s;embled at Corte, in
pre&s;ence of the General and the &s;upreme council
of &s;tate, it is recommended to the procuratours of
each province, to choo&s;e two of their number,
who, together with the procuratour of their ma|gi&s;trates,
may proceed to the election of the pre|&s;ident
and oratour of the general con&s;ulta. The
procuratours of each province accordingly choo&s;e
<PB N="177" REF="174">
two of their number by votes viva voce, if they
are unanimous; and if not unanimous, by bal|lot.</P>
<P>The&s;e two, with the procuratour of the ma|gi&s;trates
of each province, come before the &s;u|preme
council, to whom every one of them gives
in a &s;ealed note, containing the name of the per&s;on
who, he thinks, &s;hould be pre&s;ident: the&s;e notes
are con&s;idered by the &s;upreme council, and the
three who have mo&s;t notes in&s;cribed with their
names, are put to a ballot; and he who carries
two thirds of the votes in his favour, is made
pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>In the &s;chedule or note, a procuratour may in|&s;ert
the name of his relation, or of one who has
been &s;trongly recommended to him; but by bal|lot,
he can freely give his vote for the per&s;on
whom he thinks mo&s;t de&s;erving; &s;o that it often
happens, that the per&s;on among the three, who
had the fewe&s;t notes for him, will be made pre|&s;ident
by a great majority. This appears to me
another abu&s;e; for a procuratour, by in&s;erting
in the &s;chedule the name of one of whom he
does not approve, runs a ri&s;k of having the man
whom he thinks mo&s;t de&s;erving, thrown out al|together.
Be&s;ides, he ought not to be moved by
con&s;iderations of connection or of recommenda|tion.
<PB N="178" REF="175">
The members of the &s;upreme council
have al&s;o their votes in this ballot for the pre&s;i|dent.
The oratour is cho&s;en exactly in the &s;ame
manner.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident governs during the &s;itting of the
general con&s;ulta. The oratour reads the different
papers &s;ubjected to deliberation. Propo&s;itions
from the government are addre&s;&s;ed to the pre&s;i|dent.
Tho&s;e from the people are addre&s;&s;ed to
the oratour. If a propo&s;ition from the govern|ment
is approved of by a majority of voices, it is
immediately pa&s;&s;ed into a law. But a propo&s;ition
from the people, though approved of, may be
&s;u&s;pended by the government, without a&s;&s;igning
their rea&s;ons; which, however, they are &s;trictly
obliged to do at the next general con&s;ulta.</P>
<P>This &s;u&s;pending power was greatly agitated in
the Cor&s;ican parliament; and the people oppo&s;ed
it &s;o much, that it was thought it would not
take place. But Paoli, ever ready to enlighten
his countrymen, &s;hewed them, that in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of affairs, the government may have many
de&s;igns, not mature enough for being commu|nicated
to the publick, but of e&s;&s;ential advan|tage
to the nation; &s;o that it is highly proper they
&s;hould have the privilege of delaying for a while,
any propo&s;ition which might interfere with the&s;e
<PB N="179" REF="176">
de&s;igns. Be&s;ides, the &s;upreme council, as the
grand procuratours of the nation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of their greate&s;t confidence, ought to be &s;peci|ally
heard; and if they think a propo&s;ition im|portant
and critical, may well be allowed to put
it off, till it &s;hall be fully con&s;idered by all the
&s;ubjects of the &s;tate. And this can be attended
with no bad con&s;equences; &s;ince the people may,
at an after period, pa&s;s their propo&s;ition into a
law.</P>
<P>The procuratours of each province next a&s;|&s;emble
them&s;elves, in pre&s;ence of the pre&s;ident
of the general con&s;ulta, or a pre&s;ident deputed
by him; and each province appoints its repre|&s;entative
in the &s;upreme council, for the en&s;uing
year; and one of the&s;e is elected into the office
of Great Chancellor. The &s;upreme council, for
the time being, may remon&s;trate again&s;t this
election; and the election of each province mu&s;t
be confirmed by a majority of the other provin|ces;
becau&s;e the&s;e coun&s;ellors, with the General
of the kingdom, are to form the executive pow|er
of the whole nation; the general con&s;ulta or
legi&s;lative power devolving upon them that high
commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The General holds his office for life. He is
perpetual pre&s;ident of the &s;upreme council of nine.
<PB N="180" REF="177">
He votes in all que&s;tions; and in ca&s;e of an equa|lity,
he has a ca&s;ting vote. He is ab&s;olute com|mander
of the troops or militia of the i&s;land.
His office much re&s;embles that of the Stadtholder
of Holland.</P>
<P>The procuratours of each province al&s;o choo&s;e
the provincial magi&s;trates for the en&s;uing year.
This magi&s;tracy is regularly compo&s;ed of a pre&s;i|dent,
two con&s;ultors, an auditour and a chancel|lor:
but the number is varied in different pro|vinces,
in the &s;ame manner as the magi&s;tracy in
different villages. The auditour and chancel|lor
have &s;mall &s;alaries; and the magi&s;tracy have
their table kept at the publick expence, with a
guard of &s;oldiers in pay. The provincial ma|gi&s;trates
can try criminals, and pronounce &s;en|tence
again&s;t them; but a &s;entence for capital
puni&s;hment cannot be put in execution, till it is
approved by the &s;upreme council. In civil cau|&s;es,
they can determine finally to the extent of
fifty livres; in cau&s;es exceeding that &s;um, parties
may appeal to the Rota Civile, which is a tri|bunal
con&s;i&s;ting of three doctours of laws, cho|&s;en
by the &s;upreme council, and continued at
their plea&s;ure. This tribunal judges according
to the civil and canon laws, and according
to the particular laws of Cor&s;ica. The&s;e la&s;t
were partly formed in old times, and afterwards
<PB N="181" REF="178">
augmented and improved by the Genoe&s;e, who
publi&s;hed them under the title of, &startq;Statuti Civili
et Criminali del I&s;ola di Cor&s;ica.&endq; They are be|come
very &s;carce. I have a copy of them, a thin
folio, printed at Ba&s;tia, in 1694. It is a very
good little code, and does credit to Genoa. &startq;Fe|lix
&s;i &s;ic omnia. Happy would it have been
had &s;he &s;hewn the &s;ame equity in all re&s;pects.&endq;
There are al&s;o a few modern laws. Although
the judgment, both of the magi&s;trates of the
villages, and of the provincial magi&s;trates, be
final to the extent of the values I have mentioned,
yet if any per&s;on is manife&s;tly aggrieved, he may
obtain redre&s;s by applying to the &s;upreme coun|cil,
or to the court of &s;yndicato, another excel|lent
in&s;titution, which is conducted in the fol|lowing
manner.</P>
<P>In the general con&s;ulta, be&s;ides the elections
of which I have given an account, the procura|tours
al&s;o choo&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons of high credit and
re&s;pect, as &s;yndicatori. The&s;e make a tour
through the different provinces, as our judges
in Britain go the circuits. They hear complaints
again&s;t the different magi&s;trates; and if any of
them have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed their duty, they are pro|perly
cen&s;ured. The&s;e &s;yndicators are exceed|ingly
beneficial. The General him&s;elf is for the
mo&s;t part one of them. They &s;ave poor people the
<PB N="182" REF="179">
trouble and expence of going to Corte to lay
their grievances before the &s;upreme council.
They examine into every thing concerning the
provinces, reconcile the people to the whole&s;ome
&s;everity of law, encourage indu&s;try and every
good undertaking, and diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of order
and civilization in all corners of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Such is the government of Cor&s;ica; which ex|hibits
a compleat and well ordered democracy.
From the Pode&s;t&agrave; and Padri del Commune, up
to the &s;upreme council, there is a gradual pro|gre&s;&s;ion
of power, flowing from the people, which

<P>Paoli has &s;ucceeded wonderfully in &s;ettling the
claims of the feudal &s;ignors. The&s;e &s;ignors made
&s;everal applications to the government, praying
for the re&s;titution of their ancient rights. This
<PB N="186" REF="183">
was a very delicate que&s;tion. To allow to the&s;e
&s;ignors the ample privileges which they enjoyed
of old, would have been to e&s;tabli&s;h indepen|dent
principalities in Cor&s;ica, and mu&s;t have
tended to &s;ubvert the enlarged and free con&s;ti|tution,
which Paoli had formed, for the perma|nent
felicity of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;ignors had not been foremo&s;t in the glo|rious
war. They had much to lo&s;e; and he&s;i|tated
at taking arms again&s;t the republick of Ge|noa,
le&s;t they &s;hould forfeit their domains.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants, on the contrary, had plunged
at once into danger. The&s;e had nothing to lo&s;e
but their lives; and a life of &s;lavery is not be
be prized. If they &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful, they
were fired with the hopes of a double deliverance,
from the di&s;tant tyranny of the republick, and
from the more intimate oppre&s;&s;ion of their feudal
lords. This was become &s;o grievous, that a
very &s;en&s;ible Cor&s;ican owned to me, that &s;uppo|&s;ing
the republick had abandoned its preten|&s;ions
over Cor&s;ica, &s;o that the pea&s;ants &s;hould
not have been obliged to ri&s;e again&s;t the Genoe&s;e,
they would have ri&s;en again&s;t the &s;ignors.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants therefore, would not now con|&s;ent,
to return under the arbitrary power, from
which they had freed them&s;elves, in con&s;equence
of their bravery. To propo&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure to
<PB N="187" REF="184">
them, would have been enough to excite a re|volt,
to break the nation anew into parties, and
give their enemies an opportunity, of again fo|menting
di&s;cord, and hatred, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations;
till the Cor&s;icans &s;hould them&s;elves do, what all
that &s;tratagem and force of Genoa had attempted
in vain.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the &s;ignors were not to be
offended, &s;o as to make them become malecon|tents,
and di&s;turb the operations of the govern|ment.
The motto of the &s;agacious Hollanders,
&startq;Frangimur &s;i collidimur, We &s;hall go to pieces
if we da&s;h again&s;t each other,&endq; &s;hould be impre&s;|&s;ed
on the minds of the different orders of men,
in every nation; but is doubly important in an
infant &s;tate.</P>
<P>Paoli indulged the &s;ignors &s;o far, that they
them&s;elves &s;hould not be per&s;onally amenable be|fore
the magi&s;trates of the provinces in which
their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions lie. That they &s;hould
have the power of determining cau&s;es between the
pea&s;ants upon their fiefs, without being re&s;pon|&s;ible
for their &s;entences, to the provincial ma|gi&s;trates;
but that they &s;hould be &s;ubject to the
review of the &s;upreme council, and of the court
of &s;yndicato.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="185">
In this manner, the &s;ignors have the flat|tering
di&s;tinction of a certain degree of authority,
while, in reality, they are di&s;charging the united
duties of fathers of the community, Pode&s;t&agrave;s,
and provincial magi&s;trates. And as they are,
like them, &s;ubject to the cognizance of higher
judicatories, they cannot abu&s;e their powers;
but while they enjoy a pre-eminence over the
other nobles, they ju&s;t afford the &s;tate, at no
expence, an additional number of judges to pro|mote
civilization among a rude and unpoli&s;hed
people.</P>
<P>Thus have the hereditary feudal juri&s;dictions
been moderated in Cor&s;ica, by a fortunate con|currence
of accident and wi&s;dom; partly by the
tumults of a &s;pirited war, partly by the prudent
di&s;po&s;itions of an able legi&s;latour. And a &s;y&s;tem
tran&s;planted from the north, by robu&s;t Barbarians,
into mo&s;t countries of Europe, where having
taken deep root, and &s;pread wide its branches,
the utmo&s;t violence has been required to extir|pate
it, has, by a &s;torm &s;alutary to the i&s;land, and
by &s;kilful management, been brought under
command, and even rendered u&s;eful in Cor|&s;ica.</P>
<P>When the government &s;hall have arrived at
greater maturity, and time &s;hall have abated the
<PB N="189" REF="186">
ardour of rule, the &s;ignors will be di&s;po&s;ed to re|&s;ign
a di&s;tinction attended with more trouble than
advantage.</P>
<P>In this manner is the Cor&s;ican government
carried on, and, no doubt, they will be able to
render it &s;till more perfect; though as it now is,
I look upon it as the be&s;t model that hath ever
exi&s;ted in the democratical form.</P>
<P>Sparta, indeed, was a nervous con&s;titution;
but with reverence to the memory of immortal
Lycurgus, Sparta was deficient in gentlene&s;s and
humanity. That total inver&s;ion of the human af|fections,
that extinction of every finer feeling,
was a &s;ituation &s;o forced, and &s;o void of plea&s;ure,
that it is not to be envied. We mu&s;t indeed ad|mire
the a&s;toni&s;hing influence of their legi&s;latour.
But we may be allowed to think that all he ob|tained
by it, was only the pre&s;ervation of a &s;tate;
and pre&s;ervation is nothing, without happine&s;s.
Sir James Steuart is of opinion, that, &startq;had the
Lacedemonians adhered to the principles of their
government, and &s;pirit of their con&s;titution, they
might have perhaps &s;ub&s;i&s;ted to this very day
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy, book II. chap. 14.</NOTE>.&endq; I believe it might have been &s;o. But,
<PB N="190" REF="187">
could Lycurgus have changed his Spartans into
men of &s;tone, they would have la&s;ted &s;till
longer.</P>
<P>In the con&s;titution of Cor&s;ica, while proper
mea&s;ures are taken for the continuation of the
&s;tate, individuals have the full enjoyment of all
the comforts of life. They are men, as well as
citizens; and when once they &s;hall have entirely
freed them&s;elves from the Genoe&s;e, I cannot ima|gine
a country more happy. Animated with this
pro&s;pect, Paoli &s;ways the hearts of his country|men.
Their love for him is &s;uch, that although
the power of the General is properly limited, the
power of Paoli knows no bounds. It is high
Trea&s;on &s;o much as to &s;peak again&s;t, or calum|niate
him; a &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m, founded, con|trary
to the principles of Monte&s;quieu, on the af|fection
of love. I &s;hall fini&s;h my account of the
government of this i&s;land, with a very remarka|ble
anecdote.</P>
<P>A Cor&s;ican who had been formerly in the &s;er|vice
of the French king, and had obtained the
cro&s;s of St. Louis, upon his return to his native
country, had entered into &s;ome practices which
were contrary to the liberty of it. He was al&s;o
&s;u&s;pected to have a de&s;ign again&s;t the General's
life. Upon this he was &s;ent to pri&s;on, from
<PB N="191" REF="188">
whence, however, after &s;ome time, he was, at
the interce&s;&s;ion of the French general then in the
i&s;land, &s;et at liberty. Not long after, he was
a &s;econd time caught in other &s;ecret and trea&s;on|able
practices, and was again &s;ent to pri&s;on. His
life was again a&s;ked, together with his freedom,
by the French commander; who being refu&s;ed
this reque&s;t, de&s;ired to know of Paoli what he
intended to do with the pri&s;oner? &startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid Pa|oli,
&startq;I will tell you. When I &s;hall have per|fected
the liberty of my country, and &s;hall have
fixed it upon that e&s;tabli&s;hment which I think
mo&s;t likely to maintain it; I will then call to|gether
the &s;tates of the i&s;land, and will produce
the man. I will &s;hew him that liberty, that
form of government, that happine&s;s which he
wanted to de&s;troy. After which, I will bani&s;h
him from the i&s;land, for ever.&endq; Such is the
manner of thinking of this illu&s;trious chief.</P>
<P>The religion of Cor&s;ica is the Roman Catho|lick
faith, in which the&s;e i&s;landers are very zea|lous.
Perhaps they have a degree of &s;uper&s;tition;
which is the be&s;t extreme. No nation can pro&s;per
without piety; for when that fails, publick &s;pirit
and every noble &s;entiment will decay. The doc|trine
of looking up to an all-ruling Providence,
and that of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments,
<PB N="192" REF="189">
rendered the Roman people virtuous and
great. In proportion as the&s;e doctrines were
weakened, by the fal&s;e philo&s;ophy of Epicurus,
the minds of the Romans were impoveri&s;hed, and
their manly patrioti&s;m was &s;ucceeded by effemi|nate
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which quickly brought them to
contempt and ruin.</P>
<P>Although firmly attached to their religion, as
the revelation &s;ent from GOD, the Cor&s;icans pre|&s;erve
in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, the &s;ame &s;pirit of
boldne&s;s and freedom, for which they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
in civil affairs. They are &s;worn enemies
to the temporal power of the church. Indeed
the late violent differences between the national
government and the bi&s;hops, has pretty well di|mini&s;hed
their prejudices with re&s;pect to the per|&s;ons
of the clergy.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican bi&s;hops, who are five in num|ber,
and &s;uffragans of the archbi&s;hop of Pi&s;a,
were warmly attached to Genoa; for on Genoa
they depended for promotion. They thought fit
to preach up the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h doctrines of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
and &s;tigmatized the patriots as rebels.
The government de&s;ired that they might re&s;ide
in the territories of the nation, and promi&s;ed
them a guard, to protect them from any in&s;ult.
But the bi&s;hops knew well, that in the territories
<PB N="193" REF="190">
of the nation, they could not preach the doctrines
of tyranny, and therefore refu&s;ed to re&s;ide there.
Upon which, the government prohibited the pa|triots
from having any intercour&s;e with the bi|&s;hops;
with which they mo&s;t readily complied.</P>
<P>The Pope, &s;orry to &s;ee the Cor&s;icans like
&s;heep without a &s;hepherd, re&s;olved to &s;end them
an apo&s;tolick Vi&s;iter, to officiate in place of the
bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e, con&s;idering this as in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
taking part with the malecontents, gave in a
long remon&s;trance to the Pope, &s;etting forth,
&startq;That they were &s;en&s;ible of the rectitude of the
intentions of his holine&s;s, and were ever ready
to &s;hew their unalterable devotion towards the
holy &s;ee: but they begged leave to &s;ay, that no
provi&s;ion he &s;hould make again&s;t the &s;piritual
evils of Cor&s;ica, could be effectual, without the
concurrence of the republick.&endq;</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans, happy to receive &s;uch counte|nance
from the church, laughed at this laboured
and artful remon&s;trance. &startq;Ecco la &s;tatua di Na|bucco,
il capo d'oro e piedi di creta. Si comin|cia
dal complimento, e &s;i termina nella minac|cia.
Behold the &s;tatue of Nebuchadnezar! the
head of gold, and the feet of clay. It begins
<PB N="194" REF="191">
with a compliment, and ends with a threaten|ing.&endq;</P>
<P>The court of Naples thought proper to inter|po&s;e,
in behalf of Genoa. Cardinal Or&s;ini, the
Neapolitan mini&s;ter at the court of Rome, gave
al&s;o in remon&s;trances; and &s;ome very plodding
and heavy Genoe&s;e Canon, publi&s;hed a very long
Di&s;cor&s;o Theologico-Canonico-Politico, full of
quotations from innumerable authorities, and no
doubt a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf, that his performance was
unan&s;werable. But the Pope adhered to his re&s;o|lution,
and &s;ent Mon&s;ignore Ce&s;are Cre&s;cenzio de
Angelis, bi&s;hop of Segni, as apo&s;tolick Vi&s;iter
over all Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans accepted of his mi&s;&s;ion, with
the greate&s;t cordiality and joy. Signor Barbaggi,
who is married to the niece of Paoli, welcomed
him to the i&s;land, in a polite oration. He was
not only to perform the functions of the bi&s;hops,
but was to be general of all the Religious in Cor|&s;ica,
appointing under him a provincial vicar.
He was a man of &s;o much piety, good &s;en&s;e, and
engaging conduct, that the people conceived an
univer&s;al love and regard for him.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e no longer continued their Ligu|rian
deceit, but threw off the ma&s;k. They pu|bli&s;hed
<PB N="195" REF="192">
a manife&s;to, prohibiting all their &s;ubjects
in Cor&s;ica, under the heavie&s;t penalties, to com|ply
with the orders of the apo&s;tolick Vi&s;iter, and
offering &s;ix thou&s;and Roman crowns, to any per|&s;on
who &s;hould bring him pri&s;oner to any of their
fortre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This audacious edict the Pope very gravely
annulled, with great &s;olemnity. Some ages ago,
he would have performed a more dreadful cere|mony.
The government of Cor&s;ica again, pu|blickly
proclaimed their di&s;plea&s;ure, at the &s;canda|lous
temerity of the republick of Genoa, &startq;who,&endq; &s;aid
they, &startq;have &s;ent forth an edict, by which they
have not only offended again&s;t the re&s;pect due
to the holy &s;ee; but have pre&s;umed to meddle
in the affairs of this kingdom, which no longer
acknowledges them as &s;overeign. Therefore we
declare the &s;aid edict, to be de&s;tructive of reli|gion,
and of the apo&s;tolick authority; offen&s;ive
to the maje&s;ty of the vicar of Chri&s;t; &s;editious,
and contrary to the &s;ecurity and tranquillity of
our &s;tate, and tending to corrupt our laws and
good cu&s;toms. And we have condemned it to
be publickly torn, and burnt, by the hands of
the common hangman: and this to prevent &s;uch
unworthy memorials from Genoa, in time com|ing.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="193">
This &s;entence was put in execution, by beat
of drum below the gallows, in the city of Corte,
upon the &s;pot where &s;tood the hou&s;e of the wretch
who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Gaffori.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t political &s;tep in the Cor&s;icans.
They recommended them&s;elves to the Pope; they
appeared firm, and authoritative; and they put
contempt upon their enemies.</P>
<P>Having thus got rid of their tyrannical bi&s;hops,
the Cor&s;icans very wi&s;ely began to con&s;ider, that,
as the&s;e dignified churchmen refu&s;ed to re&s;ide and
perform the duties of their offices, there was no
occa&s;ion for &s;ending them con&s;iderable &s;ums, to
enable them to live in idlene&s;s and luxury, when
the money might be much better employed.
They therefore thought it highly rea&s;onable, that
the bi&s;hops tithes &s;hould go to the publick cham|ber
of the &s;tate; and accordingly it was &s;o de|creed.</P>
<P>A prodigious outery was rai&s;ed again&s;t this.
But the Cor&s;icans defended their conduct with
great force and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>&startq;Hanno u&s;urpate le decime, ed occupati i be|ni

truppa, della no&s;tra finanza?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;U&s;urped is ill &s;aid. We will confe&s;s the truth,
without di&s;gui&s;e; &s;ince he who walketh &s;imply,
<PB N="199" REF="196">
walketh &s;urely. The government hath taken a
portion of the tithes, and of the goods of the
bi&s;hops. And the rea&s;ons for it, are the&s;e, fir&s;t,
becau&s;e we are under a nece&s;&s;ity to do &s;o, which
is a right &s;uperiour to every other. In the &s;itu|ation
in which we are, there is no medium; or
liberty, or the mo&s;t horrible &s;lavery. Not to
fall into &s;lavery, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to make
war. To &s;u&s;tain the war it is nece&s;&s;ary for us
to have troops. And when we found, that the
taxes of the &s;eculars were not &s;ufficient to pay the
troops, it was decreed in a Con&s;ulta, that we
&s;hould take &s;ub&s;idy from the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, after
the example of St. Peter, and of all princes.
But, &s;ay the Genoe&s;e, &startq;Princes do not &s;upport a
rebel army.&endq; An army which defends their
liberty, their life, their honour and their coun|try,
from the mo&s;t unju&s;t of all oppre&s;&s;ions,
is more &s;acred, more venerable, more pious
than that of a croi&s;ade. Secondly, becau&s;e Be|nedict
the XI. granted the tithes, for three years,
to James king of Arragon, on purpo&s;e that he
might drive the Genoe&s;e from this kingdom.
And if the ca&s;e is the &s;ame, the nece&s;&s;ity &s;till
greater, and the circum&s;tances more pre&s;&s;ing,
&s;hall not what was lawful then, be granted
<PB N="200" REF="197">
now? Thirdly, becau&s;e nobody is under a
greater obligation to contribute to the expence
of this war, than our bi&s;hops; as they alone
have hitherto derived any profit from it; hav|ing
obtained the &s;acred mitre, which they
would not have obtained in a thou&s;and years
of peace. How? The &s;eculars have &s;hed a
river of blood, to procure them &s;o noble a ca|pital,
of which they have enjoyed the fruits,
and are they not in duty bound, to do every
thing to pre&s;erve to the patriots, what advan|tage
they have gained, and to aid them in get|ting
more? Fourthly, becau&s;e our bi&s;hops, in|&s;tead
of being grateful, in&s;tead of acting like
pa&s;tours and fathers, have behaved them&s;elves
as enemies. They have de&s;erted their dioce|&s;es,
and retired into the territory of our foes.
They have lent large &s;ums of money, to car|ry
on the war: nay they have them&s;elves
&s;hewn a dreadful ho&s;tility by their &s;piritual
arms, and have ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to return
to their flocks. To oblige them to return, our
government hath tried the &s;ame remedy which
Ab&s;alom employed, to bring Joab back to his
duty. If they are more froward than Joab,
who will feel for them? who will find fault
<PB N="201" REF="198">
with the conduct of our government? To
conclude, the tithes of tho&s;e who do not re|&s;ide,
who do not &s;erve at the altar, and much
more of tho&s;e who betray it, fall to the poor.
Now what can be poorer than our troops, than
our finances?&endq;</P>
<P>The tithes in Cor&s;ica are, in general, about
a twentieth part of every production. The go|vernment
has at pre&s;ent a pretty good &s;hare of
them; as it not only takes the revenues of the
bi&s;hops, but al&s;o tho&s;e of nominal benefices,
where there is no care of &s;ouls, and all the pen|&s;ions
which the Pope u&s;ed to grant to foreign ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticks,
out of the rich livings. When the
affairs of the i&s;land &s;hall be &s;ettled, no doubt the
government will re&s;tore the bi&s;hops rents. But
application will be made to the Pope, to have
the number of bi&s;hops increa&s;ed, in order that
the epi&s;copal functions may be better admini&s;tred,
and that the &s;pirit of equality may be more pre|&s;erved;
for the bi&s;hops, when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
their large revenues, would be like princes in
the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Several of the inhabitants of Cor&s;ica, have
made a compo&s;ition with the church, for their
tithes; and the de&s;cendants of the Caporali, who
<PB N="202" REF="199">
were of &s;uch &s;ervice to Hugo Colonna, in ex|pelling
the Saracens, are, by &s;pecial privilege,
exempted from paying any tithes. This privi|lege
is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been granted to them,
very anciently by the Pope, in who&s;e cau&s;e it
was, that they &s;hewed their zeal. The clergy of
Cor&s;ica, in general, are not as yet very learned;
as the barbarous policy of Genoa to keep the
i&s;land in ignorance, and the many years of con|fu&s;ion
and war, have prevented the cultivation
of letters. There are, however, here and there,
&s;ome prie&s;ts, who have had an education upon
the continent, and are very well in&s;tructed, and
they are all very pious, and of irreproachable
morals.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, 65 convents of Men|dicant
Friars; viz. 34 of Ob&s;ervants, and 14
of Reformed, of the order of St. Francis, and
17 of Capuchins. Every one of the&s;e convents,
has only a wood for retired walks, a garden and
a &s;mall vineyard. They depend altogether on
the charity of the people. There are two col|leges
of Je&s;uits, two convents of Dominicans,
five of Servites, and one of Mi&s;&s;ionaries; all of
whom have very good po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. There are
al&s;o &s;ome lands belonging to other religious
<PB N="203" REF="200">
orders, particularly to the Carthu&s;ians of Pi&s;a,
the &s;evere &s;anctity of whom, mu&s;t &s;ecure them
the veneration of every body, and pre&s;erve their
rights inviolated even in times of the greate&s;t
di&s;traction.</P>
<P>It would be expected, that in this i&s;land, the
mona&s;teries for women &s;hould bear &s;ome pro|portion
to the convents for men; yet, in fact,
there is not a &s;ingle nunnery in all Cor&s;ica. To
account for this, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that the
mona&s;tick in&s;titution has been frequently per|verted
to &s;ecular purpo&s;es; &s;o that the nobility
in catholick countries, who are de&s;irous to ag|grandize
their families, make their daughters take
the veil, &s;olely that their portions may be &s;aved
for the elde&s;t &s;on. The Genoe&s;e, who wanted to
keep the Cor&s;icans in continual &s;ubjection, devi|&s;ed
every method to prevent any of the nobles in
the i&s;land from becoming con&s;iderable. They
therefore prohibited mona&s;teries, in order to out
them off from one method of growing richer.
Eriars they rather encouraged, in order to le&s;&s;en
population, and to leave upon families, a num|ber
of unmarried women, than which nothing can
be a greater burden, as is &s;adly experienced in
prote&s;tant countries.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="201">
Convents &s;hould be laid under &s;uch re&s;tricti|ons,
that what is intended as a &s;olemn religious
in&s;titution, may not become &s;o common as to lo&s;e
its effect, and be reckoned a profe&s;&s;ion for the
dull or the indolent.</P>
<P>Under proper re&s;trictions, it mu&s;t be for the
advantage of religion, to have a few venerable
&s;anctuaries, for the reception of tho&s;e, who hav|ing
done their duty to &s;ociety, are &s;o much rai&s;ed
above the world, that they would choo&s;e entirely
to devote the evening of life, to pious contem|plation
and prayer; not to mention tho&s;e, who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions have hurried them into offences, for
which they &s;incerely re&s;olve, by a cour&s;e of ab|&s;traction,
of penitance and of voluntary au&s;teri|ties
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See that maje&s;tick teacher of moral and religious wi&s;|dom, the Rambler, number 110.</NOTE>, to make expiation to the eternal ju&s;tice
of the DIVINITY.</P>
<P>From Paoli's care and attention to the good of
his country, it is probable the number of convents
in Cor&s;ica will be reduced. The pre&s;ent fathers
indeed, are well entitled to a peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
during their lives; but regulations may be
<PB N="205" REF="202">
made to prevent many noviciates, e&s;pecially of
very young per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican clergy, and particularly the
monks, have been warmly intere&s;ted for the
patriots. Padre Leonardo, a Franci&s;can, and
one of the profe&s;&s;ours of the univer&s;ity of Corte,
hath publi&s;hed a little tract, a &startq;Di&s;cor&s;o Sacro-Ci|vile,&endq;
teaching that tho&s;e who fall in battle for
their country, are to be con&s;idered as martyrs.
This di&s;cour&s;e hath had great effect. We know
what force of mind that doctrine hath given to the
Turks and to the Ru&s;&s;ians. Indeed, that patro|ti&s;m
is a virtue which merits heaven, was held by
Cicero: &startq;Omnibus qui patriam con&s;ervaverint,
adjuverint, auxerint, certus e&s;t in coelo et defi|nitus
locus, ubi beati aevo &s;empiterno fruantur
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cic. Somn. Scip.</NOTE>. For tho&s;e who have pre&s;erved, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
and aggrandized their country, there is a certain
and fixed place in heaven, where they are ble&s;t
with the enjoyment of eternal life.&endq;</P>
<P>The warlik force of Cor&s;ica principally con|&s;i&s;ts
in a bold and re&s;olute militia: every Cor&s;i|can
has a mu&s;ket put into his hand, as &s;oon as he
is able to carry it; and as there is a con&s;tant
<PB N="206" REF="203">
emulation in &s;hooting, they become excellent
mark&s;men, and will hit with a &s;ingle bullet a
very &s;mall mark at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>There is in every village a Capitano d'arme;
and in every pieve, a Commi&s;&s;ario d'arme, who
has the command over all the Capitani d'arme of
his di&s;trict. The&s;e officers are cho&s;en by the
General, with the approbation of the people. They
are ever ready to receive his orders, and to call
out &s;uch a number of men, as he &s;hall at any time
require for the publick &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, but 500 &s;oldiers who
have pay; 300 for a guard to the General, and
200 to furni&s;h guards for the magi&s;trates of the
&s;everal provinces, and to garri&s;on a few &s;mall forts
at particular places in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>A militia is indeed the true &s;trength of a free
nation. Rome had no &s;oldiers in pay till the
347 year after the building of the city; and
then they were introduced by the patricians, to
ingratiate them&s;elves with the people, at a time
when the &s;enate was embarra&s;&s;ed with the great
influence of the Tribunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Liv. lib. iv. cap. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="204">
Paoli devi&s;ed a &s;ingular and excellent method
of promoting bravery among his countrymen.
He wrote a circular letter to the prie&s;ts of every
pari&s;h in the i&s;land, de&s;iring a li&s;t to be made out
of all tho&s;e who have fallen in battle for their
country. The letter was in the&s;e terms.</P>

The prie&s;ts have been very regular in making
returns in con&s;equence of this letter. No in&s;ti|tution
was ever better contrived. It might be
adopted by every nation, as it would give double
courage to &s;oldiers, who would have their fame
pre&s;erved, and at the &s;ame time leave to their re|lations
the valuable legacy of a claim to the kind|ne&s;s
of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I have often wondered how the love of fame
carries the common &s;oldiers of our armies, in|to
the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t dangers; when all
that they do is hardly known even to their re|lations,
and never heard of in any publick man|ner.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans are not yet much trained, as
they have been acting chiefly upon the defen&s;ive,
and carrying on a &s;ort of irregular war. But now
that they are advancing fa&s;t to a total victory over
their enemies, a certain degree of di&s;cipline be|comes
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A Cor&s;ican is armed with a gun, a pi&s;tol and
a &s;tiletto. He wears a &s;hort coat, of a very coar&s;e
dark cloth, made in the i&s;land, with wai&s;tcoat
and breeches of the &s;ame, or of French or Italian
cloth, e&s;pecially &s;carlet. He has a cartridge-box
or pouch for his ammunition, fixed round his mid|dle,
by a belt. Into this pouch his &s;tiletto is
<PB N="211" REF="208">
&s;tuck; and on the left &s;ide of his belt he hangs
his pi&s;tol. His gun is &s;lung acro&s;s his &s;houlder.
He wears black leather &s;patterda&s;hes, and a &s;ort
of bonnet of black cloth, lined with red freeze,
and ornamented on the front, with a piece of &s;ome
finer &s;tuff neatly &s;ewed about. This bonnet is
peculiar to the Cor&s;icans, and is a very ancient
piece of dre&s;s: it is doubled up on every &s;ide,
and when let down, is preci&s;ely the figure of a
helmet, like tho&s;e we &s;ee on Trajan's pillar.
The Cor&s;ican dre&s;s is very convenient for tra|ver&s;ing
the woods and mountains; and gives a
man an active and warlike appearance.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers have no uniform; nor have the
Cor&s;icans any drums, trumpets, fifes, or any in|&s;trument
of warlike mu&s;ick, except a large Tri|ton
&s;hell pierced in the end, with which they
make a &s;ound loud enough to be heard at a great

<P><PB N="212" REF="209">
Colonel Montgomery has told me, that the
&s;hell is u&s;ed in America, particularly in Carolina.
Its &s;ound is not &s;hrill, but rather flat like that of
a large horn. It has however &s;ome re&s;emblance
to that of the Roman Lituus. Sir John Cuning|hame
of Caprinton has &s;hewn me a Lituus in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of which mention is made in Blaeu's
Atlas<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Blaeu's Atlas, p. 71. Province de Aire.</NOTE>. It was dug up in an ancient field of
battle at Coilsfield in Ayre&s;hire, and &s;erved the
old barons of Caprinton to call together their fol|lowers.</P>
<P>As the Cor&s;icans advance in improvement, they
will certainly adopt the practice of having war|like
in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, the effects of which
have been very great in ancient times, as we are
a&s;&s;ured by Polybius, a judicious and grave hi&s;to|rian,
a careful ob&s;erver of human nature, and a
man not too much given to credulity. Even in
modern armies we find con&s;iderable effects pro|duced
by them.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans make a good many guns and
pi&s;tols, mo&s;t of which are of excellent workman|&s;hip.
They al&s;o make great quantities of pow|der;
but they have as yet no foundery for can|non.
The&s;e they have either taken from their
enemies, or purcha&s;ed from abroad, or fi&s;hed from
<PB N="213" REF="210">
the wrecks of ve&s;&s;els lo&s;t in their &s;eas. Neither
do they yet make their own bullets; they bring
them from the continent, or take them from the
Genoe&s;e, at who&s;e expence they have contrived to
carry on the war. A Cor&s;ican told me that they
did not u&s;e a great many bullets, becau&s;e, &s;aid
he, &startq;Il Cor&s;o non tira, &s;e non &egrave; &s;icuro del &s;uo col|po.
A Cor&s;ican does not fire, if he is not &s;ure of
his aim.&endq;</P>
<P>They are certainly de&s;igned by nature to be
&s;trong at &s;ea, having &s;o many good harbours, and
&s;o much excellent timber: but they are not yet
&s;ufficiently &s;killed in the art of &s;hipbuilding; nor
have they money &s;ufficient to defray the expence
of employing proper artificers. They have how|ever
a number of &s;mall &s;hips, and &s;ome of a tole|rable
&s;ize; and their naval affairs are conducted
with great prudence and &s;pirit, by Count Peres,
who may be &s;tiled High Admiral of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>We have &s;een how rich Cor&s;ica naturally is in
many productions; &s;o that there is no que&s;tion
but this i&s;land might carry on a pretty exten&s;ive
commerce, in oil, wine, honey, bees-wax, &s;alt,
che&s;tnuts, &s;ilk, ro&s;in, boxwood, oak, pine, por|phyry,
marble of various kinds, lead, iron, cop|per,
&s;ilver and coral. At pre&s;ent, commerce is but
beginning to flouri&s;h among them. They find in
<PB N="214" REF="211">
their &s;eas con&s;iderable quantities of coral, of all
the three kinds, red, white and black. The Jews
of Leghorn, who have e&s;tabli&s;hed there a coral
manufactory, have a &s;ort of exclu&s;ive privilege,
from the Cor&s;icans, to this trade; and in return
are very &s;erviceable to the nation, by advancing
them money, and &s;upplying them with cannon.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans may make plenty of admirable
wines, for their grapes are excellent. They make
in Capo Cor&s;o two very good white wines; one
of them has a great re&s;emblance to Malaga. A
deal of it is annually exported to Germany, and
&s;old as &s;uch; and &s;ome of it is bought up at
Leghorn, and carried to England, where it pa&s;&s;es
equally well for the production of Spain. The
other of the&s;e white wines is &s;omething like Fron|tignac.</P>
<P>At Furiani they make a white wine very like
Syracu&s;e, not quite &s;o lu&s;cious, and upon the
whole, preferable to it. Furiani is famous in the
Cor&s;ican annals, for a violent &s;iege, where 500
Genoe&s;e were repul&s;ed and defeated by 300 Cor|&s;icans.</P>
<P>In &s;ome villages, they make a rich &s;weet wine
much re&s;embling Tokay. At Ve&s;covato and at
Campoloro, they make wine very like Burgundy;
and over the whole i&s;land there are wines of dif|ferent
<PB N="215" REF="212">
&s;orts. It is indeed wonderful, what a dif|ference
a little variation of &s;oil or expo&s;ure, even
in the &s;ame vineyard, will make in the ta&s;te of
wine. The juice of the Cor&s;ican grapes is &s;o ge|nerous,
that although un&s;kilfully manufactured,
it will always plea&s;e by its natural flavour.</P>
<P>I think there might be a wine made in Cor|&s;ica
of a good &s;ound moderate quality, &s;ome|thing
between Claret and Burgundy, which would
be very proper for this country. But the Cor&s;i|cans
have been &s;o harra&s;&s;ed for a number of
years, that they have had no lei&s;ure to improve
them&s;elves in any art or manufacture. I am how|ever
a&s;&s;ured, that the exportation of oil has a|mounted
in one year to 2,500,000 French livres,
and that of che&s;tnuts to 100,000 crowns of the
&s;ame money.</P>
<P>We may expect to &s;ee the Cor&s;icans di&s;tingui&s;h
them&s;elves as a commercial nation. Trade has al|ways
flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in republican governments,
as in Tyre, Sydon and Carthage, in ancient times;
Venice, Genoa, Lucca and the United Provinces,
in modern times. This is fully illu&s;trated by the
great John de Witt, pen&s;ioner of Holland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Witt's Intere&s;t of Holland, part III. chap. 3.</NOTE>,
<PB N="216" REF="213">
who&s;e reflections were the re&s;ult of the &s;ounde&s;t
&s;en&s;e and a long experience.</P>
<P>Nothing has ca&s;t a greater damp upon the im|provements
of Cor&s;ica, than the King of Great
Britain's proclamation after the late peace, forbid|ding
his &s;ubjects to have any intercour&s;e with
that nation. What may have been the rea&s;ons
of &s;tate for &s;uch a proclamation, I cannot take
upon me to &s;ay. It does not become me to look
behind the veil, and pry into the &s;ecrets of go|vernment.
This much I may venture to a&s;&s;ert,
that a good corre&s;pondence with Cor&s;ica would
be of no &s;mall advantage to the commercial in|tere&s;t
of this country, were it only on account of
our fi&s;h trade and our woollen manufactures; not
to mention the various other articles of traffick
which would turn out to our mutual profit.</P>
<P>I know that if it had not been for this pro|clamation,
the Cor&s;icans would, at the clo&s;e of
the la&s;t war, have had &s;everal of our &s;toute&s;t pri|vateers
in their &s;ervice, which would have effec|tually
overawed the Genoe&s;e, and given the brave
i&s;landers an authority at &s;ea, which could not
have failed to make them very re&s;pectable. And
&s;urely it would be worthy of a people whom the
felicity of freedom has rendered generous, to af|ford
their countenance to a race of heroes, who
<PB N="214" REF="214">
have done &s;o much to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the &s;ame
ble&s;&s;ings, e&s;pecially when our &s;hewing this genero|&s;ity
would greatly coincide with the commercial
intere&s;ts of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that it was the Duke de Niver|nois,
who had intere&s;t enough with our mini&s;ters,
to obtain the proclamation in favour of the Geno|e&s;e.
Some politicians have expre&s;t their &s;urpri&s;e,
that Great Britain &s;hould have favoured Genoa,
which is always attached to the French; and when
it is notorious, that without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the
French could not have fitted out that fleet at Tou|lon,
which enabled them to take Minorca; that
the Genoe&s;e continued building &s;hips for them,
during the whole of the la&s;t war, and con&s;tantly
&s;upplied them with &s;eamen: whereas the Cor&s;i|cans,
as lovers of liberty, mu&s;t naturally have a
re&s;pect for the Briti&s;h, as indeed is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We may hope that other views will prevail in
the councils of this nation. A Sovereign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of every virtue, who is animated with genuine
&s;entiments of liberty, and who feels the joy of
making his own people happy, would naturally
wi&s;h to extend his beneficence.</P>
<P>Agriculture is as yet in a very imperfect &s;tate
in Cor&s;ica. Their in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry are
ill made; and they do not make the be&s;t u&s;e of
<PB N="218" REF="215">
what they have. Their plowing is but &s;cratching
the &s;urface of the earth; and they hardly know
any thing of the advantages of manure, though
they can be at no lo&s;s for &s;ufficient quantities of it.
This general ob&s;ervation is not incompatible with
the large produce of &s;everal parts of the i&s;land,
where a greater degree of fertility, and &s;ome more
indu&s;try and attention to culture than u&s;ual are to
be found.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme council appoints two or more per|&s;ons
in each province, to &s;uperintend the cultiva|tion
of the lands, and to take the mo&s;t effectual
mea&s;ures for promoting it; and in particular, to
encourage the planting of mulberry trees, as it is
certain, that Cor&s;ica may be made to produce a
great deal of &s;ilk. As gardening has been almo&s;t
totally neglected, there is a late ordinance by
which every man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a garden, or other
enclo&s;ure, is obliged to &s;ow every year, pea&s;e,
beans and all &s;orts of garden-&s;tuff, and not le&s;s
than a pound of each, under the penalty of four
livres, to be exacted by the Pode&s;t&agrave;.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme council al&s;o appoints two con&s;uls,
to in&s;pect the kind and the price of the various
&s;orts of merchandi&s;e in the i&s;land; and to watch
over every thing that can tend towards the ad|vancement
of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="216">
Provi&s;ions are not dear in Cor&s;ica. Their prices
at a medium are as follows.</P>
<P>A labouring ox, about 80 livres.</P>
<P>A cow, from 20 to 30 livres.</P>
<P>A hor&s;e of the be&s;t quality, from 100 to 140

<P>The money of Cor&s;ica is of the &s;ame value as

<P>Oil is &s;old in barrels valued from 40 to 50

4 quarts.</P>
<P>Wine is &s;old in barrels of 12 zuchas. The
zucha contains 9 large Florence fla&s;ks.</P>
<P>Grain is &s;old by the bu&s;hel. The bu&s;hel con|tains
12 bacini. The bacino weighs about 20
pounds. The &s;ack or bu&s;hel &s;ells at 18 livres.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="217">
The Cor&s;ican pound weight is al&s;o the &s;ame
with that of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>The government is gradually taking care to
e&s;tabli&s;h an uniformity in weights and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The wages of a trade&s;man, or of a day labour|er,
are a livre a day, and victuals and drink.</P>
<P>If a trade&s;man is particularly ingenious in his
profe&s;&s;ion, he has &s;omething more.</P>
<P>Reapers have no wages in money; but be&s;ides
their victuals, each gets a bacino of the grain which
he cuts down.</P>
<P>The manufactures of Cor&s;ica are as yet very
rude. I have ob&s;erved that their wool is exceed|ingly
coar&s;e, and generally black, and that of this
they make but a thick heavy cloth. The pure
black is the mo&s;t valuable: when a little white
wool is mixed with it, the cloth is not &s;o much
e&s;teemed, being of a ru&s;&s;et grey, or brown du&s;ky
colour. They import all their fine cloth; for be|&s;ides
that there is not a &s;ufficient quantity of wool
for the &s;ervice of the i&s;land, the Cor&s;icans have
not learned to make any thing el&s;e of it, but the
coar&s;e cloth I have mentioned.</P>
<P>In Sardinia they make coverings for beds and
carpets of various colours, be&s;ides many different
&s;tuffs for clothes. When the Cor&s;icans have more
lei&s;ure, they will probably imitate their neighbours,
<PB N="221" REF="218">
in tho&s;e arts. Indeed over the greate&s;t part of Ita|ly,
none but the very pea&s;ants wear home-made
cloth; and if in &s;ome places they make cloth of a
finer kind, it is made of foreign wool imported
from different countries.</P>
<P>A good deal of flax grows in Cor&s;ica; and no
doubt abundance of it might be rai&s;ed. I expect|ed
to have found there, if not the fine webs of
Holland, Ireland and Scotland, at lea&s;t plenty of
good, &s;trong, hou&s;ehold linen. But, in reality, the
Cor&s;icans are as yet &s;o backward, that they hardly
make any linen at all, which occa&s;ions a very ex|pen&s;ive
importation.</P>
<P>A Cor&s;ican gentleman ob&s;erved to me, &startq;If we
had in our kingdom &s;uch an in&s;titution as the
Dublin Society, and a Doctour Samuel Madden
to give praemiums to tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves
in manufactures, as is done in the capital
of Ireland, we might &s;oon bring our linen to
&s;ome perfection as well as other branches.&endq;</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans have plenty of oil for their lamps,
which is the light they generally u&s;e. They al&s;o
make wax candles, and a few tallow ones; for, as
I have formerly remarked, their cattle do not
yield much fat.</P>
<P>There is plenty of leather in the i&s;land. Many
of the pea&s;ants ju&s;t harden the hides in the air,
<PB N="222" REF="219">
particularly the wild-boar &s;kins, and have their
&s;hoes made of them without being tanned. This
they are under no temptation of doing, but that
of poverty and lazine&s;s, for the art of tanning is
very well under&s;tood in Cor&s;ica, and the materi|als
for it are in &s;uch abundance, that a great deal
of bark is carried over to Italy. The Cor&s;icans
have a method of tanning with the leaves of wild
laurel, dried in the &s;un, and beaten into a powder.
This gives a &s;ort of a greeni&s;h colour to the leather.
Certainly various expedients may be u&s;ed, to &s;erve
the purpo&s;e of tanning. In the i&s;land of St. Kil|da,
they tan with the tormentil root<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M`Aulay's Hi&s;tory of St. Kilda, p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of learning in Cor&s;ica may well be
imagined at a very low ebb, &s;ince it was the de|termined
purpo&s;e of Genoa to keep the inhabi|tants
of this i&s;land in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance; and
the confu&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war have left them
no lei&s;ure to attend to any kind of &s;tudy. &startq;Inter
arma &s;ilent leges. Laws are &s;ilent amid&s;t the din
of arms,&endq; is an old ob&s;ervation; and it may be
ju&s;tly applied to the mu&s;es, whom war frightens
away from every country.</P>
<P>Paoli and the wi&s;e&s;t of the nation, with whom
he con&s;ults, very &s;oon con&s;idered, that to bring
the people of Cor&s;ica to &s;uch a &s;tate as it might
<PB N="223" REF="220">
be hoped their freedom would la&s;t, and be carried
down pure and generous to po&s;terity, it would be
nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge their minds with the partici|pation
of true &s;cience, and to furni&s;h them with
&s;ound and rational principles, by which the con|&s;titution
might be held together in firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore, after long deliberation, it was at la&s;t
re&s;olved in the year 1764, to e&s;tabli&s;h an univer&s;i|ty
in the city of Corte; upon which occa&s;ion a
manife&s;to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. VI.</NOTE> was publi&s;hed, recalling to the peo|ple
of Cor&s;ica, the barbarous policy of Genoa, in
keeping them in ignorance; and informing them
of the e&s;tabli&s;hments, which the parental care of
the government had formed for their in&s;truction.</P>
<P>This manife&s;to was no vain di&s;play of what
could not be performed. Paoli had been at the
greate&s;t pains to collect the mo&s;t knowing men in
the i&s;land; and many learned Cor&s;icans e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
in foreign &s;tates, were di&s;intere&s;ted and patrio|tick
enough, to accept of the &s;mall emoluments
which Corte could afford. They thought them|&s;elves
amply rewarded, in having an opportunity
to contribute to the happine&s;s of their native coun|try,
by re&s;cuing it from the Genoe&s;e darkne&s;s,
which was wor&s;e than that of the Goths, and en|lightening
<PB N="224" REF="221">
tho&s;e heroes who&s;e untutored patrio|ti&s;m
had &s;hone with &s;uch lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ours in the univer&s;ity of Corte, are
mo&s;tly fathers of different religious orders. They
are indefatigable in their labours, and the youth
of Cor&s;ica di&s;cover the &s;ame keenne&s;s of &s;pirit in
their &s;tudies, which characteri&s;es them in arms.
There are at Corte, &s;ome pretty good halls, where
the profe&s;&s;ours give their lectures. But it cannot
be expected that they &s;hould as yet have any thing
like the regular buildings of a college. The &s;tu|dents
are boarded in the town.</P>
<P>Under the head of learning I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that
there is a printing hou&s;e at Corte, and a book&s;el|ler's
&s;hop, both kept by a Lucce&s;e, a man of &s;ome
capacity in his bu&s;ine&s;s. He has very good types;
but he prints nothing more than the publick ma|nife&s;toes,
calendars of fea&s;t days, and little prac|tical
devotional pieces, as al&s;o the Cor&s;ican Ga|zette,
which is publi&s;hed by authority, from time
to time, ju&s;t as news are collected; for it contains
nothing but the news of the i&s;land. It admits no
foreign intelligence, nor private anecdotes; &s;o
that there will &s;ometimes be an interval of three
months during which no news-papers are publi&s;h|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="222">
It will be long before the Cor&s;icans arrive at
the refinement in conducting a news-paper, of
which London affords an unparalleled perfection;
for, I do believe, an Engli&s;h news-paper is the
mo&s;t various and extraordinary compo&s;ition that
mankind ever produced. An Engli&s;h news-paper,
while it informs the judicious of what is really
doing in Europe, can keep pace with the wilde&s;t
fancy in feigned adventures, and amu&s;e the mo&s;t
de&s;ultory ta&s;te with e&s;&s;ays on all &s;ubjects, and in
every &s;tile.</P>
<P>There are in Cor&s;ica, &s;everal treati&s;es of poli|tical
controver&s;y, &s;aid in the title to be printed at
Corte: but they are in reality printed at Lucca,
or at Leghorn. In &s;ome of the&s;e treati&s;es, of which
I have a pretty numerous collection, the authours,
with much care and thought, labour to prove to
a demon&s;tration, that the Cor&s;icans mu&s;t be free.
Their writings are a good deal in the &s;tile of the
profound tracts for and again&s;t the hereditary and
indefea&s;ible right of kings, with which all the li|braries
in this country were filled in the la&s;t age.
Authorities are heaped upon authorities, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h

Cor&s;icans in general. He has only talked in &s;trong
terms, of the barbarity of &s;uch of them, as inha|bit
the mountains and live by robberies, ju&s;t as
if writing concerning Scotland in former lawle&s;s
times, he had &s;aid, the Highlanders there are a
very wild &s;et of men.</P>
<P>My Lord Monboddo thinks, there is nothing
more required to reconcile the&s;e different charac|ters
of the Cor&s;ican &s;laves, but to &s;uppo&s;e that
tho&s;e which Diodorus had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve,
were well treated, and tho&s;e which Strabo had
occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, were ill treated. For, good
or bad treatment was &s;ufficient to make the Cor&s;i|cans
appear either of the one character, or of the
<PB N="232" REF="229">
other; as we may &s;ee in many barbarous nations
at this day.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e an univer&s;al ferociou&s;ne&s;s in
the Cor&s;icans, and I think it may well be ju&s;tified,
con&s;idering the treatment which that brave people
have met with from their oppre&s;&s;ours. For, it is ju&s;t|ly
&s;aid by the philo&s;opher of Malm&s;bury, &startq;Prop|ter

<P>Petrus Cyrnaeus lays it down as a fixed princi|ple,

<P>The fourth book of Petrus cyrnaeus is entirely
taken up with an account of his own wretched va|gabond
life, full of &s;trange, whim&s;ical anecdotes.
He begins it very gravely, &startq;Quoniam ad hunc lo|cum
perventum e&s;t, non alienum videtur, de Pe|tri
qui haec &s;crip&s;it, vita et moribus proponere.
Since we are come thus far, it will not be ami&s;s,
to &s;ay &s;omething of the life and manners of Pe|trus
who writeth this hi&s;tory.&endq; He gives a very
excellent character of him&s;elf; and I dare &s;ay a
very faithful one. But &s;o minute is his narration,
that he takes care to inform po&s;terity, that he was
very irregular in his method of walking, and that
he preferred &s;weet wine to hard. In &s;hort he was
a man of con&s;iderable parts, with a great &s;impli|city
and oddity of character.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take leave of hone&s;t Petrus; with
whom perhaps &s;ome of my readers will choo&s;e to
cultivate a farther acquaintance.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans are naturally quick and lively,
and have a particular turn for eloquence. Hie|ronymus
<PB N="234" REF="231">
de Marinis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Graev. The&s;aur. Antiq. vol. i. p. 1410.</NOTE> gives them this character:

abound in &s;warms of bees, and flow with
milk and honey; like the genius of the Cor&s;icans,

for the forum.&endq;</P>
<P>I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion two Cor&s;ican di&s;cour&s;es,

<P>The language of the Cor&s;icans is remarkably
good Italian, tinctured a little with &s;ome remains
of the dialects of the barbarous nations, and with
a few Genoe&s;e corruptions, but much purer than
in many of the Italian &s;tates. Their pronunci|ation
however is &s;omewhat coar&s;e. They give in
particular a broad &s;ound to the vowel E which
di&s;plea&s;ed me a good deal. That the Cor&s;icans
write Italian in a great degree of perfection may
be &s;een from &s;ome quotations in the cour&s;e of this
account, as well as from the manife&s;toes &s;ubjoin|ed
in the Appendix.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;icans have all a turn for the arts. I
cannot indeed &s;ay that painting has yet flouri&s;h|ed
<PB N="239" REF="236">
among them; but they &s;ucceed well in mu&s;ick
and poetry. There are few of them who do not
play upon the citra, an old Moori&s;h in&s;trument,
which they are plea&s;ed to think the ancient cytha|ra.
It has a &s;weet and romantick &s;ound, and
many of their airs are tender and beautiful.</P>
<P>They have not yet produced any large and
fini&s;hed poem. But they have many little pieces
exceedingly pretty, mo&s;t of them on war or on
love. Old Giacinto Paoli, father to the pre&s;ent
general, has left &s;everal &s;onnets compo&s;ed with
great &s;pirit. I have a good many of them; and
&s;hall in&s;ert one, of which I have attempted a
tran&s;lation. It was compo&s;ed in prai&s;e of his bro|ther-commander
General Giafferi, upon occa&s;ion
of a victory obtained by him over the Genoe&s;e,
at the &s;iege of Cordone; and while it gives a
&s;pecimen of the talents of the venerable chief, it
at the &s;ame time &s;hews his generous &s;atisfaction

They have al&s;o many little ballads and madri|gals,

<P>The character of the Cor&s;icans has been al|ready
touched, in the compari&s;on between Strabo

people of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, as well as of lively and
vigorous minds. The&s;e are the materials, of
which men are to be formed either good or bad
in a &s;uperiour degree. I always remember an
ob&s;ervation which M. Rou&s;&s;eau made to me, one

of the characters of different nations; &s;aid he,
&startq;J'aime ces caracters ou il y a de l'etoffe.&endq; It
was well &s;aid. A poor feeble &s;pirit is unable to
&s;upport the weight of great virtues. It is only
where there is &s;trength and fire, that we can hope
to form characters of worth and dignity.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;landers have abilities for any thing:
but their fourtune has been &s;uch, that they have
been con&s;picuous only for the hard and re&s;olute
qualities. Abandoned by the nations around to
<PB N="242" REF="239">
the oppre&s;&s;ion of a tyrannical republick, they have
had no opportunity of &s;hewing their genius for
learning and the arts, their ho&s;pitality, their cour|teou&s;ne&s;s,
and their other amiable virtues in civi|lized
life. What they have had an opportunity
to &s;hew, they have &s;hewn with di&s;tingui&s;hed glory.</P>
<P>The authours of the Encyclopedie &s;ay, &startq;Les
Cor&s;es &s;ont remuans, vindicatifs, et belliqueux.
The Cor&s;icans are tumultuous, vindictive and
warlike.&endq; Their &s;truggles again&s;t the tyrant
could &s;hew them in no other light.</P>
<P>A writer of the highe&s;t cla&s;s thus characteri&s;es
them: &startq;Les Cor&s;es &s;ont une poign&eacute;e d'hommes
au&s;&s;i braves et au&s;&s;i deliber&egrave;s que les Anglois.
On ne le&s;s domptera, je crois, que par la pru|dence
et la bont&egrave;. On peut voir par leur ex|emple,
quel courage et quelle vertu, donne

dangereux et inju&s;te de l'opprimer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ai de Crit. &s;ur le Prince de Machiavel. p. 114.</NOTE>. The
Cor&s;icans are a handful of men, as brave and as
determined as the Engli&s;h. I believe they will
not be &s;ubdued but by prudence and good
treatment. We may &s;ee by their example, what
courage and what virtue the love of liberty gives
to men; and how dangerous as well as unju&s;t
it is to oppre&s;s it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="240">
The manners of the Cor&s;icans have a great &s;i|milarity
with tho&s;e of the ancient Germans, as
de&s;cribed by Tacitus. They have not however
the &s;ame habit of drinking; for they are extreme|ly
temperate. Their morals are &s;trict and cha&s;te
to an uncommon degree, owing in part to good
principles unhurt by luxury; and partly to the
exerci&s;e of private revenge again&s;t &s;uch as violate
the honour of their women.</P>
<P>This la&s;t may to &s;ome appear rude and barba|rous;
but I hold it to be wi&s;e and noble. Better
occa&s;ional murders than frequent adulteries. Bet|ter
cut off a rotten branch now and then, than
that the whole of the &s;ociety &s;hould be corrupted.
When morals are intimately connected with ideas
of honour, and crimes of an alluring nature are
not committed with impunity, we may expect
that mankind will retain a proper awe, and be
kept within the bounds of their duty: and if we
have not the frivolous embelli&s;hments and tran&s;i|ent
plea&s;ures of licentious gallantry, we are free
from its effeminate di&s;quiets, its feveri&s;h pa&s;&s;ions,
its fal&s;ene&s;s and di&s;&s;imulation; while hone&s;t prin|ciples
and manly and generous affections are kept
in full vigour.</P>

the nice decorum of politene&s;s, ought not to cen|&s;ure

private revenge, the rough guardian of that
virtue which is the &s;upport of every community.</P>
<P>What Tacitus &s;ays of ancient Germany we may
&s;ay of Cor&s;ica: &startq;Nemo illic vitia ridet; nec cor|rumpere

there laughs at vice; nor is corrupting and

extrmely indolent. The women do the greate&s;t
part of the drudgery work<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>, as is al&s;o the cu&s;|tom

impatient of re&s;t.&endq; Notwith&s;tanding all that
Paoli has done, the Cor&s;icans are &s;till indolent
and aver&s;e to labour. Every year 800 or 1000
Sardinians and Lucce&s;e are employed as artificers
and day-labourers in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>M. De Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, that all indolent
nations are al&s;o proud. This is indeed the ca&s;e
of the Cor&s;icans, to which, as I have formerly ob|&s;erved,
their &s;ucce&s;s in war has contributed.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="242">
M. De Monte&s;quieu propo&s;es a very good re|medy

<P>&startq;One might turn the effect again&s;t the cau&s;e,

of Europe, where the people are &s;o much &s;truck
with the point of honour, it would be right to
give premiums, to the labourers who have be&s;t
cultivated their fields, or to artificers who have

<P>There have been many very &s;trange cu&s;toms
in Cor&s;ica. Diodorus tells us, that after the wo|men
were brought to bed, the men immediately
took care of the children, laying them&s;elves down
as if they were &s;ick, and fondling the infants, &s;o
that the mothers had no farther trouble than to
give them &s;uck<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sicul. We&s;&s;eling. p. 341.</NOTE>. So great attention to a wo|man
after &s;he has &s;uffered &s;o much for the good
of &s;ociety, had really &s;omething humane in it;
though we mu&s;t &s;mile at &s;uch &s;implicity. We
may &s;ay that it has never been paralleled by all
the complai&s;ance of modern gallantry. But this
equitable cu&s;tom is no longer in u&s;e.</P>
<P>Petrus Cyrnaeus &s;ays, that in his time marriage
was &s;o much honoured among the Cor&s;icans, that
if any young woman was &s;o poor that nobody
a&s;ked her, the neighbours rai&s;ed a contribution to
<PB N="247" REF="244">
help her to a hu&s;band. Genero&s;ity could never
be more properly exerci&s;ed. Epaminondas u&s;ed
to exerci&s;e his genero&s;ity in that way<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Corn. Nep. in vit. Epam.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome extraordinary cu&s;toms which
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Cor&s;ica. In particular they have &s;e|veral
&s;trange ceremonies at the death of their re|lations.
When a man dies, e&s;pecially if he has
been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, his widow with all the married
women in the village accompany the corp&s;e to the
grave, where after various howlings, and other
expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, the women fall upon the
widow, and beat and tear her in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable
manner. Having thus &s;atisfied their grief and
pa&s;&s;ion, they lead her back again, covered with
blood and brui&s;es, to her own habitation. This
I had no opportunity of &s;eeing, while I was in
the i&s;land; but I have it from undoubted autho|rity.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid &s;o much of the genius and charac|ter
of the Cor&s;icans, I mu&s;t beg leave to pre&s;ent
my readers with a very di&s;tingui&s;hed Cor&s;ican
character, that of Signor Clemente de' Paoli, bro|ther
of the General.</P>
<P>This gentleman is the elde&s;t &s;on of the old
General Giacinto Paoli. He is about fifty years
of age, of a middle &s;ize and dark complexion, his
<PB N="248" REF="245">
eyes are quick and piercing, and he has &s;omething
in the form of his mouth, which renders his ap|pearance
very particular. His under&s;tanding is
of the fir&s;t rate; and he has by no means &s;uffered
it to lie neglected. He was married, and has an
only daughter, the wife of Signor Barbaggi one
of the fir&s;t men in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>For the&s;e many years pa&s;t, Signor Clemente,
being in a &s;tate of widowhood, has re&s;ided at
Ro&s;tino, from whence the family of Paoli comes.
He lives there in a very retired manner. He is
of a Saturnine di&s;po&s;ition, and his notions of re|ligion
are rather gloomy and &s;evere. He &s;pends his
whole time in &s;tudy, except what he pa&s;&s;es at his
devotions. The&s;e generally take up &s;ix or eight
hours every day; during all which time he is in
church, and before the altar, in a fixed po&s;ture,
with his hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, with
&s;olemn fervour.</P>
<P>He pre&s;cribes to him&s;elf, an ab&s;temious, rigid
cour&s;e of life; as if he had taken the vows of
&s;ome of the religious orders. He is much with
the Franci&s;cans, who have a convent at Ro&s;tino.
He wears the common coar&s;e dre&s;s of the coun|try,
and it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h him from one
of the lowe&s;t of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="246">
When he is in company he &s;eldom &s;peaks, and
except upon important occa&s;ion, never goes into
publick, or even to vi&s;it his brother at Corte.
When danger calls, however, he is the fir&s;t to
appear in the defence of his country. He is then
foremo&s;t in the ranks, and expo&s;es him&s;elf to the
hotte&s;t action; for religious fear is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent
with the greate&s;t bravery; according to
the famous line of the pious Racine,</P>

crainte.</L>
<L>I fear my GOD; and Him alone I fear.</L></Q>

<DIV3>
<P>In the beginning of an engagement, he is ge|nerally
calm; and will frequently offer up a
prayer to heaven, for the per&s;on at whom he is
going to fire: &s;aying he is &s;orry to be under the
nece&s;&s;ity of depriving him of life; but that he is
an enemy to Cor&s;ica, and providence has &s;ent him
in his way, in order that he may be prevented
from doing any father mi&s;chief; that he hopes
GOD will pardon his crimes, and take him to him|&s;elf.
After he has &s;een two or three of his coun|trymen
fall at his &s;ide, the ca&s;e alters. His eyes
flame with grief and indignation, and he becomes
<PB N="250" REF="247">
like one furious, dealing vengeance every where
around him.</P>
<P>His authority in the council is not le&s;s than his
valour in the field. His &s;trength of judgment
and extent of knowledge, joined to the &s;ingular
&s;anctity of his character, give him great weight in
all the publick con&s;ultations; and his influence
is of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to his brother the Ge|neral.</P>
<P>When we thus view the Cor&s;icans gloriou&s;ly
&s;triving for the be&s;t rights of humanity, and un|der
the guidance of an illu&s;trious commander and
able &s;tate&s;man, e&s;tabli&s;hing freedom, and form|ing
a virtuous and happy nation, can we be in|different
as to their &s;ucce&s;s? Can we Britons
forbear to admire their bravery, and their wi&s;|dom?

The Cor&s;icans are in general of &s;mall &s;tature,
and rather hard-favoured, much like the Scots
Highlanders; though as we find among the&s;e, &s;o
we al&s;o find among the Cor&s;icans many of a good
&s;ize, and comely countenances.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in Cor&s;ica has not
been exactly taken of late, but they may be reck|oned
220,000 &s;ouls; for, previous to the ri&s;e in
1729, there were 40,000 families who payed tax
to Genoa, and reckoning five to each family, the
inhabitants were then 200,000.</P>
<P>Now although it may appear a paradox, it is
certain that the number of inhabitants has in|crea&s;ed
during the war; as will appear from the
following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Father Cancellotti a Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionary, who
travelled over Cor&s;ica, and informed him&s;elf with
great exactne&s;s, made a computation, that in thirty
years of Genoe&s;e government, the i&s;land lo&s;t by
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and other cau&s;es 28,000 people.</P>
<P>Whereas in the thirty &s;even years of war, the
i&s;land has not lo&s;t above 10,000 people, including
tho&s;e who have fled from the confu&s;ions of their
country, to follow fortune upon the continent.</P>
<P>And therefore this calculation of the number
of inhabitants at pre&s;ent, is a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="250">
The number of Cor&s;icans is however much le&s;s
than it was in ancient times. It is well ob&s;erved
by an able writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wallace on the Numbers of Mankind, p. 106.</NOTE>, &startq;That the depopulation of
many countries &s;eems to have been fir&s;t occa&s;ion|ed
by the havock the Romans made among the
&s;maller &s;tates and cities, before they could fully
e&s;tabli&s;h their &s;overeign power.&endq; In no &s;tate
could this cau&s;e of depopulation take place, more
than in Cor&s;ica; for in no &s;tate were the natives
harder to be &s;ubdued. When to the Roman ha|vock
we add the reiterated turmoils, which dur|ing
a cour&s;e of ages, have &s;haken this i&s;land,
we need be at no lo&s;s to account why the number
of its inhabitants is dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Of the 220,000 people computed to be in Cor|&s;ica,
there may be 10,000 in Ba&s;tia, and in all
25,000 in the territories of the Genoe&s;e; &s;o that
I reckon there are about 200,000 of the patriotick
nation, and of the&s;e Paoli can bring 40,000 armed
men into the field.</P>
<P>It is therefore by no means probable, that the
Genoe&s;e &s;hould reduce to abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;o con|&s;iderable
a nation, and a nation of &s;uch men;
mo&s;t of whom have been born in the troublous
times, and been brought up with &s;entiments of
<PB N="254" REF="251">
the mo&s;t violent hatred again&s;t the republick.
There is not a Cor&s;ican child who can procure a
little gun-powder, but he immediately &s;ets fire to
it, huzzas at the explo&s;ion, and as if he had
blown up the enemy, calls out, &startq;Ecco i Geno|ve&s;i.
There go the Genoe&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>I believe the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t nobles of Genoa
are now of opinion, that the republick &s;hould re|noucne
her preten&s;ions of dominion, over a peo|ple
whom long experience has proved to be un|conquerable
by the Genoe&s;e arms, who have baf|fled
every attempt that the republick has made a|gain&s;t
them, and who are at la&s;t formed into a
&s;tate that has a &s;olid claim to independency. But
the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Genoa, like the wi&s;e&s;t and
be&s;t of other &s;tates, are over-ruled by the majori|ty;
and the republick has hitherto continued to
drain her trea&s;ury, and &s;acrifice her &s;oldiers, in
fruitle&s;s attempts to recover Cor&s;ica.</P>

a portion of the feudal territory of the noble
family of Damari who were deprived of it by the
Genoe&s;e.</P>
<P>Capraja is about fifteen miles in circumference.
The whole of it is exceedingly mountainous, and
of a dry craggy &s;urface. It is all around &s;o pointed

upwards of 3000 inhabitants, all of whom are a&s;|&s;embled

The women employ them&s;elves chiefly in cultiva|ting
vines, in which the i&s;land is pretty fertile.
There is here a &s;trong citadel built on a high rock,
&s;o that it commands the town and harbour. It is
well furni&s;hed with artillery, and the Genoe&s;e kept
there a garri&s;on. There are al&s;o two other towers

<P>In the month of December 1766, Signor Paul

<P>On his return to Cor&s;ica, he propo&s;ed to Paoli

enterpri&s;e was committed to Signor Achilles Mu|rati,
commandant at Erbalonga, and Signor John
Bapti&s;t Ri&s;tori, commandant at Furiani, who on
the evening of the 16th of February 1767, &s;et &s;ail
from the port of Macinajo, accompanied by Signor
Mattei and &s;everal gallant young gentlemen of the
principal families in the provinces of Capo Cor&s;o
and Nebbio, who cho&s;e to go as volunteers.
They had al&s;o a few Caprae&s;e to &s;erve as guides.</P>
<P>They landed on Capraja that night. The Cor|&s;ican
commanders &s;ignified to the Caprae&s;e, that
they were come with no ho&s;tile intentions again&s;t
them; but only to expel from their country, the
Genoe&s;e, that the inhabitants of Capraja might
participate the happy fruits of liberty, in common
with their ancient friends the Cor&s;icans: and there|fore
they hoped that in&s;tead of meeting with op|po&s;ition,
they would be received with cordiality.
Upon this, a number of the inhabitants immediate|ly
joined them, and they laid &s;iege to the citadel.</P>

The Genoe&s;e were piqued to the greate&s;t de|gree,

out to be a &s;et of rebels under the awe of a French
guard, were boldly &s;allying forth, and wre&s;ting
from them the &s;overeignty of another i&s;land in the
Mediterranean; an event which could not fail to
blaze abroad over Europe, and equally contribute
to the glory of the Cor&s;icans and to the di&s;grace

or care to defeat the enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>They &s;ent out a con&s;iderable armament under

galley-&s;lave effectuated a landing, at a
place neglected by the Cor&s;icans as inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>While Matra attacked the Cor&s;icans by land,
Signor Pinello attaked them from the &s;ea, on two
different quarters; &s;o that they had a very hot
and difficult action to maintain. Notwith&s;tand|ing
all which, Pinello was beaten off, and Ma|tra's

difficult, the communication between
Genoa and her garri&s;ons in Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>Sir James Steuart hath placed the Cor&s;icans in
rather an unfavourable light. His words are, &startq;The
Cor&s;icans have exported, that is, &s;old the be&s;t

<P>With this re&s;pectable writer' permi&s;&s;ion, it was

the face of the globe, where luxury has never

MANIFESTO
DEL GENERALE,
E SUPREMO CONSIGLIO DI STATO
DEL REGNO DI CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>LA giu&s;tizia della no&s;tra guerra contro la repubblica di Genova
&egrave; tanto nota al mondo, quanto la nece&s;&s;it&agrave; che ci ha indotti
a prender le armi per &s;ottrarei dalla pi&ugrave; obbrobrio&s;a, ed in&s;offri|bile
tirannia degl' ingiu&s;ti occupatori della no&s;tra i&s;ola, e de ne|mici
della no&s;tra libert&agrave;. La moderazione, ci&ograve; non o&s;tante,
colla quale ci &s;iamo &s;empre diportati in que&s;to s&igrave; giu&s;to, e lode|vole
impegno, avendo viepi&ugrave; riempiti d' orgoglio, e fatti ogni
giorno pi&ugrave; arditi a no&s;tro danno i Signori di Genova, rende a
noi indi&s;pen&s;abile il dovere nel punto che &s;iamo per cambiar di
condotta a lor riguardo, manife&s;tarne al pubblico li motivi, e le
ragioni, onde ognuno &s;ia per&s;ua&s;o della rettitudine delle no&s;tre
determinazioni, e di quella equit&agrave;, che forma il carattere della
no&s;tra nazione.</P>
<P>Da trenta anni che noi &s;o&s;teniamo la pre&s;ente guerra per i&s;ni|dare
affato dalla no&s;tra i&s;ola la repubblica di Genova, mai in al|cun
modo avevamo tentato fra&s;tornare il commercio di mare a
&s;udditi di quella &s;ignoria, compa&s;&s;ionando di quelli piutto&s;to l'in|felice
&s;ituazione, che l'obligava a vivere &s;otto un governo, che
per la i&s;te&s;&s;a &s;ua co&s;tituzione non pu&ograve; &s;e non e&s;&s;er tiranno. Ma
vedendo ora con quanta o&s;tinazione, ed efficacia la predetta re|pubblica
s'affatichi per interdire, e precludere ogni &s;trada al com|mercio
marittimo nel no&s;tro regno, prendendo non &s;olamente co'
&s;uoi Ba&s;timenti armati in Cor&s;o quelli che loro rie&s;ce incontrare
di no&s;tra bandiera, ma per anche con felice ardimento finora ab|brugiando,
ed in&s;ultando quelli delle altre nazioni pi&ugrave; ri&s;petta|bili
dell' Europa, che per ragion di traffico &s;i portino ad appro|dare,
o partano da porti, e &s;cali a noi &s;oggetti della no&s;tra i&s;ola.
E vedendo in fine, che que&s;ta no&s;tra lenit&agrave;, e contegno niente &egrave;
corri&s;po&s;to dalli &s;udditi Genove&s;i, e che anche e&s;&s;i in&s;tigano il
<PB N="268" REF="263">
loro principe a privarci del beneficio del commercio con qualun|que
bandiera, lu&s;ingando&s;i con que&s;to mezzo vedere affatto la
no&s;tra nazione &s;offrir nelle loro mani il monopolo delle &s;ue &s;o|&s;tanze,
colle quali &s;i &s;ono obbligati provedere quei pre&s;idi, che
noi teniamo bloccati. Per non mancar quindi di riguardo a noi
mede&s;imi, per toglier gli o&s;tacoli, e proteggere il no&s;tro com|mercio,
e per render &s;en&s;ibile il no&s;tro ri&s;entimento a coloro,
che &s;ul mare impunemente finora ci hanno in&s;ultati con tanto
no&s;tro pregiudizio; prevalendoci del dritto, che ci compete, e
perch&egrave; &egrave; in&s;eparabile da quella libert&agrave;, che il cielo ha conce&s;&s;a al
no&s;tro valore, abbiamo deliberato conceder la facolt&agrave; a qua|lunque
de' no&s;tri nazionali, che vole&s;&s;e armar ba&s;timenti da Cor&s;o
contro de Genove&s;i no&s;tri nemici, e lor bandiera, d' inalberare il
no&s;tro padiglione dopo aver pre&s;o per&ograve; da noi il pa&s;&s;aporto, e
le i&s;truzioni opportune; la quale facolt&agrave; nell' i&s;te&s;&s;o modo,
e forma, volentieri accorderemo ancora a qualunque &s;traniere,
che vole&s;&s;e &s;ervir&s;ene contro de' mede&s;imi no&s;tri nemici, e lor
bandiera, bonificandogli, ed a&s;&s;icurandogli tutti que' privilegi,
che in uguali circo&s;tanze &s;ogliono accordar&s;i agli armatori.</P>
<P>Co&s;tretti per tanto da cos&igrave; pre&s;&s;anti motivi, e &s;ode ragioni
a far la guerra anche per mare alla repubblica no&s;tra nemica,
ci prote&s;tiamo nondimeno voler u&s;are il maggior ri&s;petto, ed i
riguardi po&s;&s;ibili a tutti i prencipi dell' Europa, e di voler pra|ticare,
ed o&s;&s;ervare le leggi, e con&s;uetudini introdotte, ed am|me&s;&s;e
nelle guerre marittime anche ver&s;o de Genove&s;i, quando i
mede&s;imi colle &s;olite loro irregolari, ed inumane procedure non
ci co&s;tringano ad appartarcene.</P>

RISULTATO DEL CONGRESSO TENUTO DA' CORSI IN
CASINCA, IN OCCASIONE DELLA GIUNTA SPEDITA
IN CORSICA DA' GENOVESI.
IL GENERALE,
ED IL SUPREMO CONSIGLIO DI STATO
DEL REGNO DI CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>LA repubblica di Genova cono&s;ciute in&s;ufficienti le proprie
&s;ue forze, non che per &s;ottometterci all' aborrito di lei do|minio,
ma ben anche per far pi&ugrave; lunga re&s;i&s;tenza a quelle, che
ci forni&s;ce la no&s;tra unione, ed il no&s;tro invincibile attacca|mento
alla libert&agrave; da qualche tempo a que&s;ta parte, ma &s;empre
invano non ha mai ce&s;&s;ato di tentare con tutta la maggior effi|cacia
delle &s;ue impo&s;ture d' indi&s;porre contra di noi, e ricever
&s;occor&s;o da qualche gran Corte d' Europa.</P>
<P>Vedendo&s;i ora delu&s;a in que&s;to &s;uo di&s;egno, e &s;apendo beni&s;|&s;imo
riputar&s;i da ogn' uno un dritto dell' umanit&agrave; il dare una

futuro congre&s;&s;o di pace con&s;iderata, e la giu&s;tizia della no&s;tra
cau&s;a colle no&s;tre &s;olenni determinazioni, e l' incompatibilita
del &s;uo governo col genio dei no&s;tri popoli, i principi d' Eu|ropa
per non la&s;ciare acce&s;a in &s;eno all' Italia una &s;cintilla di

e che ad altro fine non vorrebbe far valere &s;opra que&s;to regno,
che per riempirlo di mi&s;erie, e d' orrore. In tale &s;tato di co&s;e
&s;eguendo l' impul&s;o della &s;ua pa&s;&s;ione predominante di &s;tragi, e
di vendette, ella ha creduto non poter&s;i meglio opporre alle no|&s;tre

e coll' offerta di gradi militari, e &s;tipendi alcuni uomini vili, e

ora prevenire l' attenzione dei gabinetti per mezzo de' &s;uoi

<P>Noi amati&s;&s;imi compatriotti quali per raggione del no&s;tro

nazione nel convento di S. France&s;co della pieve di Ca&s;inca
nelle fe&s;tivit&agrave; di penteco&s;te. Previddero il colpo fatale della

a vuoto. D. Filippo Grimaldi alla te&s;ta de' banditti, e
facinoro&s;i fatti venire appo&s;tatamente da Genova in Ba&s;tia coll'
intelligenza del Martinetti, e coll' apparato di molti ba&s;timenti

<P>E &s;ebbene vi &s;ia luogo a credere, che le intenzioni di S. Ma|e&s;t&agrave;

direttamente la guerra ad una nazione, che &s;empre &s;i &egrave; fatta

<HEAD>THE
JOURNAL
OF A
TOUR
TO
CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING re&s;olved to pa&s;s &s;ome years abroad,
for my in&s;truction and entertainment, I
conceived a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the i&s;land of Cor|&s;ica.
I wi&s;hed for &s;omething more than ju&s;t the
common cour&s;e of what is called the tour of Eu|rope;
and Cor&s;ica occurred to me as a place
which no body el&s;e had &s;een, and where I &s;hould
find what was to be &s;een no where el&s;e, a people
actually fighting for liberty, and forming them|&s;elves
from a poor incon&s;iderable oppre&s;&s;ed na|tion,
into a flouri&s;hing and independent &s;tate.</P>
<P>When I got into Switzerland, I went to &s;ee
M. Rou&s;&s;eau. He was then living in romantick
retirement, from whence, perhaps, it had been
better for him never to have de&s;cended. While
he was at a di&s;tance, his &s;ingular eloquence filled
<PB N="288" REF="281">
our minds with high ideas of the wild philo&s;o|pher.
When he came into the walks of men,
we know alas! how much the&s;e ideas &s;uffered.</P>
<P>He entertained me very courteou&s;ly; for I
was recommended to him by my honoured friend
the Earl Mari&s;chal, with whom I had the happi|ne&s;s
of travelling through a part of Germany.
I had heard that M. Rou&s;&s;eau had &s;ome corre&s;|pondence
with the Cor&s;icans, and had been de|&s;ired
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in forming their laws. I told
him my &s;cheme of going to vi&s;it them, after I
had compleated my tour of Italy; and I in&s;i&s;ted
that he &s;hould give me a letter of introduction.
He immediately agreed to do &s;o, whenever I
&s;hould acquaint him of my time of going thi|ther;
for he &s;aw that my enthu&s;ia&s;m for the
brave i&s;landers was as warm as his own.</P>
<P>I accordingly wrote to him from Rome, in
April 1765, that I had fixed the month of Sep|tember
for my Cor&s;ican expedition, and therefore
begged of him to &s;end me the letter of introduc|tion,
which if he refu&s;ed, I &s;hould certainly go
without it, and probably be hanged as a &s;py.
So let him an&s;wer for the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The wild philo&s;opher was a man of his word;
and on my arrival at Florence in Augu&s;t, I re|ceived
the following letter:</P>

<DIV2>
<P>Furni&s;hed with the&s;e credentials, I was impa|tient
to be with the illu&s;trious Chief. The
charms of &s;weet Siena detained me longer than
they &s;hould have done. I required the hardy air
of Cor&s;ica to brace me, after the delights of Tu&s;|cany.</P>
<P>I recollect with a&s;toni&s;hment how little the real
&s;tate of Cor&s;ica was known, even by tho&s;e who
had good acce&s;s to know it. An officer of rank
in the Briti&s;h navy, who had been in &s;everal ports
of the i&s;land, told me that I run the ri&s;k of my
life in going among the&s;e barbarians; for, that
his &s;urgeon's mate went a&s;hore to take the diver|&s;ion
of &s;hooting, and every moment was alarmed
by &s;ome of the natives, who &s;tarted from the
bu&s;hes with loaded guns, and if he had not been
protected by Cor&s;ican guides, would have cer|tainly
blown out his brains.</P>
<P>Nay at Leghorn, which is within a day's &s;ailing
of Cor&s;ica, and has a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with it,
<PB N="293" REF="286">
I found people who di&s;&s;uaded me from going thi|ther,
becau&s;e it might be dangerous.</P>
<P>I was however under no apprehen&s;ion in going to
Cor&s;ica, Count Rivarola the Sardinian con&s;ul, who
is him&s;elf a Cor&s;ican, a&s;&s;uring me that the i&s;land
was then in a very civilized &s;tate; and be&s;ides,
that in the rude&s;t times no Cor&s;ican would ever
attack a &s;tranger. The Count was &s;o good as to
give me mo&s;t obliging letters to many people
in the i&s;land. I had now been in &s;everal foreign
countries. I had found that I was able to accom|modate
my&s;elf to my fellow-creatures of different
languages and &s;entiments. I did not fear that it
would be a difficult ta&s;k for me to make my&s;elf
ea&s;y with the plain and generous Cor&s;icans.</P>
<P>The only danger I &s;aw was, that I might be
taken by &s;ome of the Barbary cor&s;airs, and have
a tryal of &s;lavery among the Turks at Algiers. I
&s;poke of it to commodore Harri&s;on, who com|manded
the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterra|nean,
and was then lying with his &s;hip the Centu|rion,
in the bay of Leghorn. He a&s;&s;ured me, that
if the Turks did take me, they &s;hould not keep
me long; but in order to prevent it, he was &s;o
good as to grant me a very ample and particular
pa&s;sport; and as it could be of no u&s;e if I did not
meet the cor&s;airs, he &s;aid very plea&s;antly when he
<PB N="294" REF="287">
gave it me, &startq;I hope, Sir, it &s;hall be of no u&s;e
to you.&endq;</P>
<P>Before I left Leghorn, I could ob&s;erve, that
my tour was looked upon by the Italian politici|ans
in a very &s;erious light, as if truly I had a com|mi&s;&s;ion
from my Court, to negotiate a treaty with
the Cor&s;icans. The more I di&s;claimed any &s;uch
thing, the more they per&s;evered in affirming it;
and I was con&s;idered as a very clo&s;e young man.
I therefore ju&s;t allowed them to make a mini&s;ter
of me, till time &s;hould undeceive them.</P>
<P>I &s;ailed from Leghorn in a Tu&s;can ve&s;&s;el,
which was going over to Capo Cor&s;o for wine.
I preferred this to a ve&s;&s;el going to Ba&s;tia, becau&s;e
as I did not know how the French general was
affected towards the Cor&s;icans, I was afraid that
he might not permit me to go forward to Paoli.
I therefore re&s;olved to land on the territories of
the nation, and after I had been with the illu&s;|trious
Chief, to pay my re&s;pects to the French if
I &s;hould find it &s;afe.</P>
<P>Though from Leghorn to Cor&s;ica, is u&s;ually
but one day's &s;ailing, there was &s;o dead a calm
that it took us two days. The fir&s;t day was the
mo&s;t tedious. However there were two or three
Cor&s;icans aboard, and one of them played on the
citra, which amu&s;ed me a good deal. At &s;un|&s;et
<PB N="295" REF="288">
all the people in the &s;hip &s;ung the Ave Maria,
with great devotion and &s;ome melody. It was
plea&s;ing to enter into the &s;pirit of their religion,
and hear them offering up their evening ori&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day we became better acquainted,
and more lively and cheerful. The worthy Cor|&s;icans
thought it was proper to give a moral
le&s;&s;on to a young traveller ju&s;t come from Italy.
They told me that in their country I &s;hould be
treated with the greate&s;t ho&s;pitality; but if I at|tempted
to debauch any of their women, I might
expect in&s;tant death.</P>
<P>I employed my&s;elf &s;everal hours in rowing,
which gave me great &s;pirits. I reli&s;hed fully my
approach to the i&s;land, which had acquired an un|u&s;ual
grandeur in my imagination. As long as I
can remember any thing, I have heard of &startq;The
malecontents of Cor&s;ica, with Paoli at their
head.&endq; It was a curious thought that I was ju&s;t
going to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock at night, we landed &s;afely
in the harbour of Centuri. I learnt that Signor
Giaccomini of this place, to whom I was recom|mended
by Count Rivarola, was ju&s;t dead. He
had made a hand&s;ome fortune in the Ea&s;t Indies;
and having had a remarkable warmth in the cau&s;e
of liberty during his whole life, he &s;hewed it in
<PB N="296" REF="289">
the &s;tronge&s;t manner in his la&s;t will. He bequeath|ed
a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and &s;ome pieces
of ordnance, to the nation. He al&s;o left it in
charge to his heir, to live in Cor&s;ica, and be firm
in the patriotick intere&s;t; and if ever the i&s;land
&s;hould again be reduced under the power of the
Genoe&s;e, he ordered him to retire with all his ef|fects
to Leghorn. Upon the&s;e conditions only,
could his heir enjoy his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I was directed to the hou&s;e of Signor Giacco|mini's
cou&s;in, Signor Antonio Antonetti at Mor|&s;iglia,
about a mile up the country. The pro&s;|pect
of the mountains covered with vines and olives,
was extremely agreeable; and the odour of the
myrtle and other aromatick &s;hrubs and flowers
that grew all around me, was very refre&s;hing. As
I walked along, I often &s;aw Cor&s;ican pea&s;ants
come &s;uddenly out from the covert; and as they
were all armed, I &s;aw how the frightened imagina|tion
of the &s;urgeon's mate had rai&s;ed up &s;o many
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Even the man who carried my baggage
was armed, and had I been timorous might have
alarmed me. But he and I were very good com|pany
to each other. As it grew du&s;ky, I repeated
to my&s;elf the&s;e lines from a fine pa&s;&s;age in Ari|o&s;to:</P>
<Q><PB N="297" REF="290">
<L>E pur per &s;elve o&s;cure e calli obliqui</L>
<L>In&s;ieme van, &s;enza &s;o&s;petto aver&s;i.</L>
<L>ARIOST. Canto 1.</L>
<L>Together through dark woods and winding ways</L>
<L>They walk, nor on their hearts &s;u&s;picion preys.</L></Q>
<P>I delivered Signor Antonetti the letter for his
decea&s;ed cou&s;in. He read it, and received me
with unaffected cordiality, making an apology for
my frugal entertainment, but a&s;&s;uring me of a
hearty welcome. His true kindly ho&s;pitality was
al&s;o &s;hewn in taking care of my &s;ervant, an ho|ne&s;t
Swi&s;s, who loved to eat and drink well.</P>
<P>I had formed a &s;trange notion that I &s;hould &s;ee
every thing in Cor&s;ica totally different from what I
had &s;een in any other country. I was therefore
much &s;urpri&s;ed to find Signor Antonetti's hou&s;e
quite an Italian one, with very good furniture,
prints, and copies of &s;ome of the famous pictures.
In particular, I was &s;truck to find here a &s;mall
copy from Raphael, of St. Michael and the Dra|gon.
There was no nece&s;&s;ity for its being well
done. To &s;ee the thing at all was what &s;urpri&s;ed
me.</P>
<P>Signor Antonetti gave me an excellent light re|pa&s;t,
and a very good bed. He &s;poke with great
&s;trength of the patriotick cau&s;e, and with great
<PB N="298" REF="291">
veneration of the General. I was quite ea&s;y, and
liked much the opening of my Cor&s;ican tour.</P>
<P>The next day, being Sunday, it rained very
hard; and I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the Cor&s;icans with
all their re&s;olution, are afraid of bad weather, to a
degree of effeminacy. I got indeed a droll
but a ju&s;t enough account of this, from one of
them: &startq;Sir, &s;aid he, if you were as poor as a
Cor&s;ican, and had but one coat, &s;o as that after
being wet, you could not put on dry cloths,
you would be afraid too.&endq; Signor Antonetti
would not allow me to &s;et out while it rained, for,
&s;aid he, &startq;Quando &s;i trova fuori, patienza; ma
di andare fuori &egrave; cattivo. If a man finds him|&s;elf
abroad, there is no help for it. But to go
deliberately out, is too much.&endq;</P>
<P>When the day grew a little better, I accom|panied
Signor Antonetti and his family, to hear
ma&s;s in the pari&s;h church, a very pretty little
building, about half a quarter of a mile off.</P>
<P>Signor Antonetti's pari&s;h prie&s;t was to preach
to us, at which I was much plea&s;ed, being very
curious to hear a Cor&s;ican &s;ermon.</P>
<P>Our prie&s;t did very well. His text was in the
P&s;alms: &startq;De&s;cendunt ad infernum viventes.
They go down alive into the pit.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="292">
After endeavouring to move our pa&s;&s;ions with
a de&s;cription of the horrours of hell, he told us,
&startq;Saint Catharine of Siena wi&s;hed to be laid on
the mouth of this dreadful pit, that &s;he might
&s;top it up, &s;o as no more unhappy &s;ouls &s;hould
fall into it. I confe&s;s, my brethren, I have
not the zeal of holy Saint Catharine. but I do
what I can; I warn you how to avoid it.&endq; He
then gave us &s;ome good practical advice, and con|cluded.</P>
<P>The weather being now cleared up, I took
leave of the worthy gentleman to whom I had been
a gue&s;t. He gave me a letter to Signor Damiano
Toma&s;i, Padre del Commune at Pino, the next
village. I got a man with an a&s;s to carry my bag|gage.
But &s;uch a road I never &s;aw. It was ab|&s;olutely
&s;crambling along the face of a rock over|hanging
the &s;ea, upon a path &s;ometimes not above
a foot broad. I thought the a&s;s rather retarded
me; &s;o I prevailed with the man, to take my
portmanteau and other things on his back.</P>
<P>Had I formed my opinion of Cor&s;ica from what
I &s;aw this morning, I might have been in as bad
humour with it, as Seneca was, who&s;e reflections
in pro&s;e are not inferiour to his epigrams: &startq;Quid

<P>At Pino I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find my&s;elf met by
&s;ome bri&s;k young fellows dre&s;t like Engli&s;h &s;ail|ors,
and &s;peaking Engli&s;h tolerably well. They
had been often with cargoes of wine at Leghorn,
where they had picked up what they knew of our
language, and taken clothes in part of payment
for &s;ome of their merchandi&s;e.</P>
<P>I was cordially entertained at Signor Toma&s;i's.
Throughout all Cor&s;ica, except in garri&s;on towns,
there is hardly an inn. I met with a &s;ingle one,
<PB N="301" REF="294">
about eight miles from Corte. Before I was ac|cu&s;tomed
to the Cor&s;ican ho&s;pitality, I &s;ometimes
forgot my&s;elf, and imagining I was in a publick
hou&s;e, called for what I wanted, with the tone
which one u&s;es in calling to the waiters at a ta|vern.
I did &s;o at Pino, a&s;king for a variety of
things at once; when Signora Toma&s;i perceiving
my mi&s;take, looked in my face and &s;miled, &s;ay|ing
with much calmne&s;s and good nature, &startq;Una
co&s;a dopo un altra, Signore. One thing after
another, Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>In writing this Journal, I &s;hall not tire my
readers, with relating the occurences of each par|ticular
day. It will be much more agreeable to
them, to have a free and continued account of
what I &s;aw or heard, mo&s;t worthy of ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, I had very curious travelling,
mo&s;tly on foot, and attended by a couple of
&s;tout women, who carried my baggage upon
their heads. Every time that I prepared to &s;et
out from a village, I could not help laughing, to
&s;ee the good people eager to have my equipage in
order, and roaring out, &startq;Le Donne, Le Donne.
The Women, The Women.&endq;</P>
<P>I had full lei&s;ure and the be&s;t opportunities to
ob&s;erve every thing, in my progre&s;s through the
<PB N="302" REF="295">
i&s;land. I was lodged &s;ometimes in private hou&s;es,
&s;ometimes in convents, being always well recom|mended
from place to place. The fir&s;t convent
in which I lay, was at Canari. It appeared a
little odd at fir&s;t. But I &s;oon learnt to repair to
my dormitory as naturally as if I had been a friar
for &s;even years.</P>
<P>The convents were &s;mall decent buildings, &s;uit|ed
to the &s;ober ideas of their pious inhabitants.
The religious who devoutly endeavour to &startq;walk
with GOD,&endq; are often treated with raillery, by
tho&s;e whom plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s prevents from
thinking of future and more exalted objects. A
little experience of the &s;erenity and peace of mind
to be found in convents, would be of u&s;e to
temper the fire of men of the world.</P>
<P>At Patrimonio I found the &s;eat of a provincial
magi&s;tracy. The chief judge was there, and en|tained
me very well. Upon my arrival, the cap|tain
of the guard came out, and demanded who
I was? I replied &startq;Ingle&s;e, Engli&s;h.&endq; He looked
at me &s;eriou&s;ly, and then &s;aid in a tone between
regret and upbraiding, &startq;Ingle&s;e, c'erana$i no&s;tri
amici; ma non le &s;ono pi&ugrave;. The Engli&s;h; they
were once our friends; but they are &s;o no
more.&endq; I felt for my country, and was aba&s;hed
before this hone&s;t &s;oldier.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="296">
At Oletta I vi&s;ited Count Nicholas Rivarola,
brother to my friend at Leghorn. He received
me with great kindne&s;s, and did every thing in his
power to make me ea&s;y. I found here a Cor&s;ican
who thought better of the Briti&s;h, than the captain
of the guard at Patrimonio. He talked of our
bombarding San Fiorenzo, in favour of the pa|triots,
and willingly gave me his hor&s;e for the af|ternoon,
which he &s;aid he would not have done
to a man of any other nation.</P>
<P>When I came to Morato, I had the plea&s;ure of
being made acquainted with Signor Barbaggi,
who is married to the niece of Paoli. I found
him to be a &s;en&s;ible intelligent well-bred man.
The mint of Cor&s;ica was in his hou&s;e. I got &s;pe|cimens
of their different kinds of money in &s;ilver
and copper, and was told that they hoped in a
year or two to &s;trike &s;ome gold coins. Signor
Barbaggi's hou&s;e was repairing, &s;o I was lodged
in the convent. But in the morning returned to
breakfa&s;t, and had chocolate; and at dinner we
had no le&s;s than twelve well-dre&s;t di&s;hes, &s;erved on
Dre&s;den china, with a de&s;ert, different &s;orts of
wine, and a liqueur, all the produce of Cor&s;ica.
Signor Barbaggi was frequently repeating to me,
that the Cor&s;icans inhabited a rude uncultivated
country, and that they lived like Spartans. I
<PB N="304" REF="297">
begged leave to a&s;k him in what country he could
could &s;hew me greater luxury than I had &s;een
in his hou&s;e; and I &s;aid I &s;hould certainly tell
wherever I went, what tables the Cor&s;icans kept,
notwith&s;tanding their preten&s;ions to poverty and
temperance. A good deal of plea&s;antry pa&s;&s;ed
upon this. His lady was a genteel woman, and
appeared to be agreeable, though very re&s;erved.</P>
<P>From Morato to Corte, I travelled through a
wild mountainous rocky country, diver&s;ified with
&s;ome large valleys. I got little bea&s;ts for me and
my &s;ervant, &s;ometimes hor&s;es, but oftner mules
or a&s;&s;es. We had no bridles, but cords fixed
round their necks, with which we managed them
as well as we could.</P>
<P>At Corte I waited upon the &s;upreme council,
to one of whom, Signor Boccociampe, I had
a letter from Signor Barbaggi. I was very politely
received, and was conducted to the Franci&s;can
convent, where I got the apartment of Paoli,
who was then &s;ome days journey beyond the
mountains, holding a court of &s;yndicato at a vil|lage
called Sollacaro.</P>
<P>As the General re&s;ided for &s;ome time in this
convent, the fathers made a better appearance
than any I &s;aw in the i&s;land. I was principally
attended by the Priour, a re&s;olute divine, who
<PB N="305" REF="298">
had formerly been in the army, and by Padre Giu|lio,
a man of much addre&s;s, who &s;till favours
me with his corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>The&s;e fathers have a good vineyard and an excel|lent
garden. They have between 30 and 40 bee-hives
in long wooden ca&s;es or trunks of trees, with a co|vering
of the bark of the cork tree. When they
want honey, they burn a little juniper-wood, the
&s;moak of which makes the bees retire. They then
take an iron in&s;trument with a &s;harp-edged
crook at one end of it, and bring out the greate&s;t
part of the honey-comb, leaving only a little for
the bees, who work the ca&s;e full again. By tak|ing
the honey in this way, they never kill a bee.
They &s;eemed much at their ea&s;e, living in peace
and plenty. I often joked with them on the text
which is applied to their order: &startq;Nihil habentes
et omnia po&s;&s;identes, Having nothing, and yet
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things.&endq;</P>
<P>I went to the choir with them. The &s;ervice was
conducted with propriety, and Padre Giulio play|ed
on the organ. On the great altar of their church
is a tabernacle carved in wood by a Religious. It
is a piece of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. A Genoe&s;e
gentleman offered to give them one in &s;ilver for
it; but they would not make the exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="299">
The&s;e fathers have no library worth mention|ing;
but their convent is large and well built.
I looked about with great attention, to &s;ee if I
could find any in&s;criptions; but the only one I
found was upon a certain u&s;eful edifice:</P>
<Q><L>Sine nece&s;&s;itate huc non intrate,</L>
<L>Quia nece&s;&s;aria &s;umus.</L></Q>
<P>A &s;tudies, rhiming, Latin conceit marked upon
&s;uch a place was truly ludicrous.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e to &s;top a while at Corte, to repo&s;e my|&s;elf
after my fatigues, and to &s;ee every thing a|bout
the capital of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>The morning after my arrival here, three
French de&s;erters de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. The
fooli&s;h fellows had taken it into their heads, that
I was come to rai&s;e recruits for Scotland, and &s;o
they begged to have the honour of going along
with me; I &s;uppo&s;e with intention to have the
honour of running off from me, as they had done
from their own regiments.</P>
<P>I received many civilities at Corte from Signor
Boccociampe, and from Signor Ma&s;&s;e&s;i the Great
Chancellor, who&s;e &s;on Signor Luigi a young
gentleman of much vivacity, and natural polite|ne&s;s,
was &s;o good as to attend me con&s;tantly as
my conductour. I u&s;ed to call him my gover|nour.
<PB N="307" REF="300">
I liked him much, for as he had never been
out of the i&s;land, his ideas were entirely Cor&s;ican.</P>
<P>Such of the members of the &s;upreme council
as were in re&s;idence during my &s;tay at Corte, I
found to be &s;olid and &s;agacious, men of penetra|tion
and ability, well calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Gene|ral
in forming his political plans, and in turning
to the be&s;t advantage, the violence and enterpri&s;es
of the people.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity was not then &s;itting, &s;o I could
only &s;ee the rooms, which were &s;hewn me by the
Abb&eacute; Valentini, procuratour of the univer&s;ity.
The profe&s;&s;ours were all ab&s;ent except one Capu|chin
father whom I vi&s;ited at his convent. It is
a tolerable building, with a pretty large collection
of books. There is in the church here a taber|nacle
carved in wood, in the manner of that at
the Franci&s;cans, but much inferiour to it.</P>
<P>I went up to the ca&s;tle of Corte. The com|mandant
very civilly &s;hewed me every part of it.
As I wi&s;hed to &s;ee all things in Cor&s;ica, I de&s;ired
to &s;ee even the unhappy criminals. There were
then three in the ca&s;tle; a man for the murder
of his wife; a married lady who had hired one of
her &s;ervants to &s;trangle a woman of whom &s;he
was jealous; and the &s;ervant who had actually
perpetrated this barbarous action. They were
<PB N="308" REF="301">
brought out from their cells, that I might talk
with them. The murderer of his wife had a
&s;tupid hardened appearance, and told me he did it
at the in&s;tigation of the devil. The &s;ervant was
a poor de&s;picable wretch. He had at fir&s;t accu&s;ed
his mi&s;tre&s;s, but was afterwards prevailed with to
deny his accu&s;ation, upon which he was put to
the torture, by having lighted matches held be|tween
his fingers. This made him return to
what he had formerly &s;aid, &s;o as to be a &s;trong
evidence again&s;t his mi&s;tre&s;s. His hands were &s;o
mi&s;erably &s;corched, that he was a piteous object.
I a&s;ked him why he had committed &s;uch a crime,
he &s;aid, &startq;Perche era &s;enza &s;pirito, Becau&s;e I
was without under&s;tanding.&endq; The lady &s;eemed of
a bold and re&s;olute &s;pirit. She &s;poke to me with
great firmne&s;s, and denied her guilt, &s;aying with
a contemptuous &s;mile, as &s;he pointed to her &s;er|vant,
&startq;They can force that creature to &s;ay what
they plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The hangman of Cor&s;ica was a great curio&s;ity.
Being held in the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation, he dur&s;t not
live like another inhabitant of the i&s;land. He
was obliged to take refuge in the ca&s;tle, and there
he was kept in a little corner turret, where he had
ju&s;t room for a mi&s;erable bed, and a little bit of
fire to dre&s;s &s;uch victuals for him&s;elf as were &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="309" REF="302">
to keep him alive; for nobody would have
any intercour&s;e with him, but all turned their
backs upon him. I went up and looked at him.
And a more dirty rueful &s;pectacle I never beheld.
He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ituation, and held down
his head like an abhorred outca&s;t.</P>
<P>It was a long time before they could get a
hangman in Cor&s;ica, &s;o that the puni&s;hment of
the gallows was hardly known, all their criminals
being &s;hot. At la&s;t this creature whom I &s;aw,
who is a Sicilian, came with a me&s;&s;age to Paoli.
The General who has a wonderful talent, for phy|&s;iognomy,
on &s;eeing the man, &s;aid immediately to
&s;ome of the people about him, &startq;Ecco il boia,
Behold our hangman.&endq; He gave orders to a&s;k
the man if he would accept of the office, and his
an&s;wer was, &startq;My grandfather was a hangman,
my father was a hangman. I have been a hang|man
my&s;elf, and am willing to continue &s;o.&endq; He
was therefore immediately put into office, and the
ignominious death di&s;pen&s;ed by his hands, hath
had more effect than twenty executions by fire
arms.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that no Cor&s;ican would upon
any account con&s;ent to be hangman. Not the
greate&s;t criminals, who might have had their lives
upon that condition. Even the wretch, who for
<PB N="310" REF="303">
a paultry hire, had &s;trangled a woman, would ra|ther
&s;ubmit to death, than do the &s;ame action, as
the executioner of the law.</P>
<P>When I had &s;een every thing about Corte, I
prepared for my journey over the mountains, that
I might be with Paoli. The night before I &s;et
out, I recollected that I had forgotten to get a
pa&s;&s;port, which, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Cor&s;i|ca,
is &s;till a nece&s;&s;ary precaution. After &s;upper
therefore the Priour walked with me to Corte, to
the hou&s;e of the Great Chancellor, who ordered
the pa&s;&s;port to be made out immediately, and
while his &s;ecretary was writing it, entertained me
by reading to me &s;ome of the minutes of the ge|neral
con&s;ulta. When the pa&s;&s;port was fini&s;hed,
and ready to have the &s;eal put to it, I was much
plea&s;ed with a beautiful, &s;imple incident. The
Chancellor de&s;ired a little boy who was playing in
the room by us, to run to his mother, and bring
the great &s;eal of the kingdom. I thought my&s;elf
&s;itting in the hou&s;e of a Cincinnatus.</P>
<P>Next morning I &s;et out in very good order,
having excellent mules, and active clever Cor&s;ican
guides. The worthy fathers of the convent who
treated me in the kinde&s;t manner while I was
their gue&s;t, would al&s;o give me &s;ome provi&s;ions
for my journey; &s;o they put up a ground of their
<PB N="311" REF="304">
be&s;t wine, and &s;ome delicious pomegranates. My
Cor&s;ican guides appeared &s;o hearty, that I often
got down and walked along with them, doing ju&s;t
what I &s;aw them do. When we grew hungry, we
threw &s;tones among the thick branches of the
che&s;tnut trees which over&s;hadowed us, and in that
manner we brought down a &s;hower of che&s;tnuts
with which we filled our pockets, and went on
eating them with great reli&s;h; and when this
made us thir&s;ty, we lay down by the &s;ide of the
fir&s;t brook, put our mouths to the &s;tream, and
drank &s;ufficiently. It was ju&s;t being for a little
while, one of the &startq;pri&s;ca gens mortalium, the
primitive race of men,&endq; who ran about in the
woods eating acorns and drinking water.</P>
<P>While I &s;topped to refre&s;h my mules at a little
village, the inhabitants came crouding about me
as an amba&s;&s;adour going to their General. When
they were informed of my country, a &s;trong black
fellow among them &s;aid, &startq;Ingle&s;e! &s;ono barbari;
non credono in Dro grande. Engli&s;h! they are
barbarians; they don't believe in the great
GOD.&endq; I told him, Excu&s;e me, Sir. We do
believe in GOD, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t too. &startq;Um,
&s;aid he, e nel Papa? and in the Pope?&endq; No.
&startq;E perche? And why?&endq; This was a puzzling
que&s;tion in the&s;e circum&s;tances; for there was a
<PB N="312" REF="305">
great audience to the controver&s;y. I thought I
would try a method of my own, and very gravely
replied, &startq;Perche &s;iamo troppo lontani. Becau&s;e
we are too far off.&endq; A very new argument a|gain&s;t
the univer&s;al infallibility of the Pope. It
took however; for my opponent mu&s;ed a while,
and then &s;aid, &startq;Troppo lontani! La Sicilia &egrave;
tanto lontana che l'Inghilterra; e in Sicilia &s;i
credono nel Papa. Too far off! Why Sicily is
as far off as England. Yet in Sicily they be|lieve
in the Pope. O, &s;aid I, noi &s;iamo dieci
volte pi&ugrave; lontani che la Sicilia! We are ten
times farther off than Sicily. Aha!&endq; &s;aid he;
and &s;eemed quite &s;atisfied. In this manner I got
off very well. I que&s;tion much whether any of
the learned rea&s;onings of our prote&s;tant divines
would have had &s;o good an effect.</P>
<P>My journey over the mountains was very enter|taining.
I pa&s;t &s;ome immen&s;e ridges and va&s;t
woods. I was in great health and &s;pirits, and
fully able to enter into the ideas of the brave
rude men whom I found in all quarters.</P>
<P>At Ba&s;telica where there is a &s;tately &s;pirited
race of people, I had a large company to attend
me in the convent. I liked to &s;e their natural
frankne&s;s and ea&s;e; for why &s;hould men be afraid
of their own &s;pecies? They ju&s;t came in making
<PB N="313" REF="306">
an ea&s;y bow, placed them&s;elves round the room
where I was &s;itting, re&s;ted them&s;elves on their
mu&s;kets, and immediately entered into conver&s;a|tion
with me. They talked very feelingly of the
mi&s;eries that their country had endured, and
complained that they were &s;till but in a &s;tate of
poverty. I happened at that time to have an
unu&s;ual flow of &s;pirits; and as one who finds
him&s;elf among&s;t utter &s;trangers in a di&s;tant coun|try,
has no timidity, I harangued the men of
Ba&s;telica with great fluency. I expatiated on the
bravery of the Cor&s;icans, by which they had pur|cha&s;ed
liberty, the mo&s;t valuable of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
and rendered them&s;elves glorious over all Europe.
Their poverty, I told them, might be remedied by
a proper cultivation of their i&s;land, and by enga|ging
a little in commerce. But I bid them re|member,
that they were much happier in their
pre&s;ent &s;tate than in a &s;tate of refinement and vice;
and that therefore they &s;hould beware of luxury.</P>
<P>What I &s;aid had the good fortune to touch
them, and &s;everal of them repeated the &s;ame &s;en|timents
much better than I could do. They all
expre&s;&s;ed their &s;trong attachment to Paoli, and
called out in one voice that they were all at his
command. I could with plea&s;ure, have pa&s;&s;ed a
long time here.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="307">
At Ornano I &s;aw the ruins of the &s;eat where
the great Sampiero had his re&s;idence. They
were a pretty droll &s;ociety of monks in the con|vent
at Ornano. When I told them that I was
an Engli&s;hman, &startq;Aye, aye, &s;aid one of them, as
was well ob&s;erved by a reverend bi&s;hop, when
talking of your pretended reformation, Angli
olim angeli nunc diaboli. The Engli&s;h formerly
angels now devils.&endq; I looked upon this as an
hone&s;t effu&s;ion of &s;piritual zeal. The fathers
took good care of me in temporals.</P>
<P>When I at la&s;t came within &s;ight of Sollacar&ograve;,
where Paoli was, I could not help being under
con&s;iderable anxiety. My ideas of him had been
greatly heightened by the conver&s;ations I had held
with all &s;orts of people in the $&s;land, they having
repre&s;ented him to me as &s;omething above hu|manity.
I had the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee &s;o ex|alted
a character; but I feared that I &s;hould be
unable to give a proper account why I had pre|&s;umed
to trouble him with a vi&s;it, and that I
&s;hould &s;ink to nothing before him. I almo&s;t
wi&s;hed yet to go back without &s;eeing him. The&s;e
workings of &s;en&s;ibility employed my mind till I
rode through the village, and came up to the
hou&s;e where he was lodged.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="308">
Leaving my &s;ervant with my guides, I pa&s;t
through the guards, and was met by &s;ome of the
General's people, who conducted me into an anti|chamber,
where were &s;everal gentlemen in waiting.
Signor Boccociampe had notified my arrival, and
I was &s;hewn into Paoli's room. I found him
alone, and was &s;truck with his appearance. He
is tall, &s;trong, and well made; of a fair complex|ion,
a &s;en&s;ible, free, and open countenance, and a
manly, and noble carriage. He was then in his
fortieth year. He was dre&s;t in green and gold.
He u&s;ed to wear the common Cor&s;ican habit, but
on the arrival of the French, he thought a little
external elegance might be of u&s;e, to make the
government appear in a more re&s;pectable light.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me what were my commands for
him. I pre&s;ented him a letter from count Riva|rola,
and when he had read it, I &s;hewed him my
letter from Rou&s;&s;eau. He was polite, but very
re&s;erved. I had &s;tood in the pre&s;ence of many a
prince, but I never had &s;uch a trial as in the pre|&s;ence
of Paoli. I have already &s;aid, that he is a
great phy&s;iognomi&s;t. In con&s;equnce of his be|ing
in continual danger from treachery and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation,
he has formed a habit of &s;tudiou&s;ly ob|&s;erving
every new face. For ten minutes we
walked backwards and forwards through the
<PB N="316" REF="309">
room, hardly &s;aying a word, while he looked at
me, with a &s;tedfa&s;t, keen and penetrating eye, as
if he &s;earched my very &s;oul.</P>
<P>This interview was for a while very &s;evere upon
me. I was much relieved when his re&s;erve wore
off, and he began to &s;peak more. I then ventur|ed
to addre&s;s him with this compliment to the
Corficans: &startq;Sir, I am upon my travels, and
have lately vi&s;ited Rome. I am come from
&s;eeing the ruins of one brave and free people:
I now &s;ee the ri&s;e of another.&endq;</P>
<P>He received my compliment very graciou&s;ly;
but ob&s;erved that the Cor&s;icans had no chance of
being like the Romans, a great conquering nation,
who &s;hould extend its empire over half the globe.
Their &s;ituation, and the modern political &s;y&s;tems,
rendered this impo&s;&s;ible. But, &s;aid he, Cor&s;ica
may be a very happy country.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed a high admiration of M. Rou&s;&s;eau,
whom Signor Buttafoco had invited to Cor&s;ica,
to aid the nation in forming its laws.</P>
<P>It &s;eems M. de Voltaire had reported, in his ral|lying
manner, that the invitation was merely a
trick which he had put upon Rou&s;&s;eau. Paoli
told me that when he under&s;tood this, he him&s;elf
wrote to Rou&s;&s;eau, enforcing the invitation. Of
this affair I &s;hall give a full account in an after
part of my Journal.</P>

Some of the nobles who attended him, came
into the room, and in a little we were told that
dinner was &s;erved up. The General did me the
honour to place me next him. He had a table
of fifteen or &s;ixteen covers, having always a good
many of the principal men of the i&s;land with him.
He had an Italian cook who had been long in
France; but he cho&s;e to have a few plain &s;ub|&s;tantial
di&s;hes, avoiding every kind of luxury,
and drinking no foreign wine.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf under &s;ome con&s;traint in &s;uch a
circle of heroes. The General talked a great deal
on hi&s;tory and on literature. I &s;oon perceived
that he was a fine cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, that his mind
was enriched with a variety of knowledge, and
that his conver&s;ation at meals was in&s;tructive and
entertaining. Before dinner he had &s;poken French.
He now &s;poke Italian, in which he is very elo|quent.</P>
<P>We retired to another room to drink coffee.
My timidity wore off. I no longer anxiou&s;ly
thought of my&s;elf; my whole attention was em|ployed
in li&s;tening to the illu&s;trious commander
of a nation.</P>
<P>He recommended me to the care of the Abb&eacute;
Ro&s;tini, who had lived many years in France.
Signor Colonna, the lord of the manor here, be|ing
<PB N="318" REF="311">
from home, his hou&s;e was a&s;&s;igned me to
live in. I was left by my&s;elf till near &s;upper time,
when I returned to the General, who&s;e conver&s;a|tion
improved upon me, as did the &s;ociety of
tho&s;e about him, with whom I gradually formed
an acquaintance.</P>
<P>Every day I felt my&s;elf happier. Particular
marks of attention were &s;hewn me as a &s;ubject of
Great Britain, the report of which went over to
Italy, and confirmed the conjectures that I was
really an envoy. In the morning I had my cho|colate
&s;erved up upon a &s;ilver &s;alver adorned with
the arms of Cor&s;ica. I dined and &s;upped con&s;tant|ly
with the General. I was vi&s;ited by all the no|bility,
and whenever I cho&s;e to make a little tour,
I was attended by a party of guards. I begged
of the General not to treat me with &s;o much ce|remony;
but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it.</P>
<P>One day when I rode out, I was mounted on
Paoli's own hor&s;e, with rich furniture of crim&s;on
velvet, with broad gold lace, and had my guards
marching along with me. I allowed my&s;elf to
indulge a momentary pride in this parade, as I
was curious to experience what could really be
the plea&s;ure of &s;tate and di&s;tinction with which
mankind are &s;o &s;trangely intoxicated.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="312">
When I returned to the continent after all this
greatne&s;s, I u&s;ed to joke with my acquaintance,
and tell them that I could not bear to live with
them, for they did not treat me with a proper re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>My time pa&s;&s;ed here in the mo&s;t agreeable man|ner.
I enjoyed a &s;ort of luxury of noble &s;enti|ment.
Paoli became more affable with me. I
made my&s;elf known to him. I forgot the great
di&s;tance between us, and had every day &s;ome hours
of private conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>From my fir&s;t &s;etting out on this tour, I wrote
down every night what I had ob&s;erved during the
day, throwing together a great deal, that I might
afterwards make a &s;election at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e particulars, the mo&s;t valuable to my
readers, as well as to my&s;elf, mu&s;t &s;urely be the
memoirs and remarkable &s;aying of Paoli, which
I am proud to record.</P>
<P>Talking of the Cor&s;ican war, &startq;Sir, &s;aid he, if
the event prove happy, we &s;hall be called great
defenders of liberty. If the event &s;hall prove un|happy,
we &s;hall be called unfortunate rebels.&endq;</P>
<P>The French objected to him that the Cor&s;ican
nation had no regular troops. We would not
have them, &s;aid Paoli. We &s;hould then have the
bravery of this and the other regiment. At pre|&s;ent
every &s;ingle man is as a regiment him&s;elf.
<PB N="320" REF="313">
Should the Cor&s;icans be formed into regular troops,
we &s;hould lo&s;e that per&s;onal bravery which has
produced &s;uch actions among us, as in another
country would have rendered famous even a Ma|ri&s;chal.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him how he could po&s;&s;ibly have a &s;oul
&s;o &s;uperiour to intere&s;t. &startq;It is not &s;uperiour, &s;aid
he; my intere&s;t is to gain a name. I know well
that he who does good to his country will gain
that: and I expect it. Yet could I render this
people happy, I would be content to be forgot|ten.
I have an un&s;peakable pride, &startq;Una &s;uper|bia
indicibile.&endq; The approbation of my own
heart is enough.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid he would have great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing
the world, and enjoying the &s;ociety of the learned
and the accompli&s;hed in every country. I a&s;ked
him how with the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, he could bear to
be confined to an i&s;land yet in a rude uncivilized
&s;tate; and in&s;tead of participating Attick even|ings,
&startq;noctes coenaeque De&ucirc;m,&endq; be in a conti|nual
cour&s;e of care and of danger. He replied
in one line of Virgil:
<Q><L>Vincet amor patriae laudumque immen&s;a cupido.</L></Q>
<PB N="321" REF="314">
This uttered with the fine open Italian pronuci|ation,
and the graceful dignity of his manner, was
very noble. I wi&s;hed to have a &s;tatue of him
taken at that moment.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him if he under&s;tood Engli&s;h. He im|mediately
began and &s;poke it, which he did tole|rably
well. When at Naples, he had known &s;e|veral
Iri&s;h gentlemen who were officers in that &s;er|vice.
Having a great facility in acquiring lan|guages,
he learnt Engli&s;h from them. But as he
had been now ten years without ever &s;peaking it,
he &s;poke very &s;low. One could &s;ee that he was
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the words, but for want of what I
may call mechanical practice, he had a difficulty
in expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was diverted with his Engli&s;h library. It con|&s;i&s;ted
of</P>
<P>Some broken volumes of the Spectatour and
Tattler.</P>
<P>Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man.</P>
<P>Gulliver's Travels.</P>
<P>A Hi&s;tory of France, in old Engli&s;h.
And
Barclay's Apology for the Quakers.
I promi&s;ed to &s;end him &s;ome Engli&s;h books<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ent him the Works of Harrington, of Sidney, of Addi&s;on, of Trenchard, of Gordon, and of other writers in favour of liberty. I have al&s;o &s;ent him &s;ome of our be&s;t books of morality and entertainment, in particular the Works of Mr. Samuel John&s;on, with a compleat &s;et of the Spectatour, Tattler and Guardian; and to the Univer&s;ity of Corte, I have &s;ent a few of the Greek and Roman Cla&s;&s;icks, of the beautiful editions of the Me&s;&s;ieurs Foults at Gla&s;gow.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="315">
He convinced me how well he under&s;tood our
language; for I took the liberty to &s;hew him a
Memorial which I had drawn up on the advan|tages
to Great Britain from an alliance with Cor|&s;ica,
and he tran&s;lated this memorial into Italian
with the greate&s;t facility. He has &s;ince given me
more proofs of his knowledge of our tongue by his
an&s;wers to the letters which I have had the ho|nour
to write to him in Engli&s;h, and in particular
by a very judicious and ingenious critici&s;m on
&s;ome of Swift's works.</P>
<P>He was well acquainted with the hi&s;tory of
Britain. He had read many of the parliamentary
debates, and had even &s;een a number of the North
Briton. He &s;hewed a con&s;iderable knowledge of
this country, and often introduced anecdotes and
drew compari&s;ons and allu&s;ions from Britain.</P>
<P>He &s;aid his great object was to form the Cor&s;i|cans
in &s;uch a manner that they might have a firm
con&s;titution, and might be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without
him. &startq;Our &s;tate, &s;aid he, is young, and &s;till re|quires
the leading &s;trings. I am de&s;irous that the
<PB N="323" REF="316">
Cor&s;icans &s;hould be taught to walk of them&s;elves.
Therefore when they come to me to a&s;k whom
they &s;hould choo&s;e for their Padre del Commune,
or other Magi&s;trate, I tell them, You know bet|ter
than I do, the able and hone&s;t men among
your neighbours. Con&s;ider the con&s;equence of
your choice, not only to your&s;elves in particular,
but to the i&s;land in general. In this manner I ac|cu&s;tom
them to feel their own importance as
members of the &s;tate.&endq;</P>
<P>After repre&s;enting the &s;evere and melancholy
&s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion under which Cor&s;ica had &s;o
long groaned, he &s;aid, &startq;We are now to our coun|try
like the prophet Eli&s;hah &s;tretched over the
dead child of the Shunamite, eye to eye, no&s;e to
no&s;e, mouth to mouth. It begins to recover
warmth, and to revive. I hope it &s;hall yet regain
full health and vigour.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;aid that things would make a rapid progre&s;s,
and that we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee all the arts and &s;cien|ces
flouri&s;h in Cor&s;ica. &startq;Patience, Sir, &s;aid he. If
you &s;aw a man who had fought a hard battle,
who was much wounded, who was beaten to the
ground, and who with difficulty could lift him&s;elf
up, it would not be rea&s;onable to a&s;k him to get
his hair well dre&s;t, and to put on embroidered
clothes. Cor&s;ica has fought a hard battle, has been&endq;
<PB N="324" REF="317">
&startq;much wounded, has been beaten to the ground,
and with difficulty can lift her&s;elf up. The arts
and &s;ciences are like dre&s;s and ornament. You
cannot expect them from us for &s;ome time. But
come back twenty or thirty years hence, and we'll
&s;hew you arts and &s;cience, and concerts and a&s;|&s;emblies,
and fine ladies, and we'll make you fall
in love among us, Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;miled a good deal, when I told him that
I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find him &s;o amiable, ac|compli&s;hed,
and polite; for although I knew I
was to &s;ee a great man, I expected to find a rude
character, an Attila king of the Goths, or a Luit|prand
king of the Lombards.&endq;</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that although he had often a placid
&s;mile upon his countenance, he hardly ever laugh|ed.
Whether loud laughter in general &s;ociety
be a &s;ign of weakne&s;s or ru&s;ticity, I cannot &s;ay;
but I have remarked that real great men, and
men of fini&s;hed behaviour, &s;eldom fall into it.</P>
<P>The variety, and I may &s;ay ver&s;atility, of the
mind of this great man is amazing. One day when
I came to pay my re&s;pects to him before dinner,
I found him in much agitation, with a circle of
his nobles around him, and a Cor&s;ican &s;tanding
before him like a criminal before his judge. Pa|oli
immediately turned to me, &startq;I am glad you&endq;
<PB N="325" REF="318">
&startq;are come, Sir. You prote&s;tants talk much again&s;t
our doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Behold here
the miracle of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, a Cor&s;ican tran|&s;ub&s;tantiated
into a Genoe&s;e. That unworthy
man who now &s;tands before me is a Cor&s;ican, who
has been long a lieutenant under the Genoe&s;e, in
Capo Cor&s;o. Andrew Doria and all their greate&s;t
heroes could not be more violent for the republick
than he has been, and all again&s;t his country.&endq;
Then turning to the man, &startq;Sir, &s;aid he, Cor&s;ica
makes it a rule to pardon the mo&s;t unworthy of
her children, when they &s;urrender them&s;elves,
even when they are forced to do &s;o, as is your
ca&s;e. You have now e&s;caped. But take care.
I &s;hall have a &s;trict eye upon you; and if ever
you make the lea&s;t attempt to return to your trai|terous
practices, you know I can be avenged of
you.&endq; He &s;poke this with the fiercene&s;s of a lion,
and from the awful darkne&s;s of his brow, one
could &s;ee that his thoughts of vengeance were
terrible. Yet when it was over, he all at once re|&s;umed
his u&s;ual appearance, called out &startq;andiamo,
come along;&endq; went to dinner, and was as cheerful
and gay as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>His notions of morality are high and refined,
&s;uch as become the Father of a nation. Were he
a libertine, his influence would &s;oon vani&s;h; for
<PB N="326" REF="319">
men will never tru&s;t the important concerns of
&s;ociety to one they know will do what is hurtful
to &s;ociety for his own plea&s;ures. He told me that
his father had brought him up with great &s;trict|ne&s;s,
and that he had very &s;eldom deviated from the
paths of virtue. That this was not from a defect
of feeling and pa&s;&s;ion, but that his mind being
filled with important objects, his pa&s;&s;ions were
employed in more noble pur&s;uits than tho&s;e of
licentious plea&s;ure. I &s;aw from Paoli's example
the great art of pre&s;erving young men of &s;pirit
from the contagion of vice, in which there is often
a &s;pecies of &s;entiment, ingenuity and enterpri&s;e
nearly allied to virtuous qualities.</P>
<P>Shew a young man that there is more real &s;pi|rit
in virtue than in vice, and you have a &s;urer
hold of him, during his years of impetuou&s;ity and
pa&s;&s;ion, than by convincing his judgment of all
the rectitude of ethicks.</P>
<P>One day at dinner, he gave us the principal
arguments for the being and attributes of GOD.
To hear the&s;e arguments repeated with graceful
energy by the illu&s;trious Paoli in the mid&s;t of his
heroick nobles, was admirable. I never felt my
mind more elevated.</P>
<P>I took occa&s;ion to mention the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia's
infidel writings, and in particular his epi&s;tle
<PB N="327" REF="320">
to Mari&s;chal Keith. Paoli who often talks with
admiration of the greatne&s;s of that monarch, in|&s;tead
of uttering any direct cen&s;ure of what he &s;aw
to be wrong in &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a hero, pau&s;ed a
little, and then &s;aid with a grave and mo&s;t expre&s;|&s;ive
look, &startq;C'e&s;t une belle con&s;olation pour un
vieux general mourant,&endq; &startq;En peu de tems vous

<P>He ob&s;erved that the Epicurean philo&s;ophy
had produced but one exalted character, whereas
Stoici&s;m had been the &s;eminary of great men.
What he now &s;aid put me in mind of the&s;e noble
lines of Lucan:</P>
<Q><L>Hi mores, haec duri immota Catonis</L>

<P>&startq;To have been a colonel, a general or a ma|ri&s;chal,

But it would not have been &s;ufficient for this &s;pi|rit,
for this imagination.&endq; Putting his hand upon
his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>He rea&s;oned one day in the mid&s;t of his nobles
whether the commander of a nation &s;hould be
married or not. &startq;If he is married, &s;aid he, there is
a ri&s;k that he may be di&s;tracted by private affairs,
and &s;wayed too much by a concern for his fami|ly.
If he is unmarried, there is a ri&s;k that not
having the tender attachments of a wife and chil|dren,
he may &s;acrifice all to his own ambition.&endq;
When I &s;aid he ought to marry and have a &s;on
to &s;ucceed him, &startq;Sir, &s;aid, he, what &s;ecurity can I
have that my &s;on will think and act as I do?&endq;
<PB N="329" REF="322" MS="Y">
&startq;What &s;ort of a &s;on had Cicero, and what had
Marcus Aurelius?&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid to me one day when we were alone,
&startq;I never will marry. I have not the conjugal vir|tues.
Nothing would tempt me to marry, but a
woman who &s;hould bring me an immen&s;e dowry,
with which I might a&s;&s;i&s;t my country.&endq;</P>
<P>But he &s;poke much in prai&s;e of marriage, as
an in&s;titution which the experience of ages had
found to be the be&s;t calculated for the happine&s;s
of individuals, and for the good of &s;ociety. Had
he been a private gentleman, he probably would
have married, and I am &s;ure would have made as
good a hu&s;band and father as he does a &s;upreme
magi&s;trate and a general. But his arduous and cri|tical
&s;ituation would not allow him to enjoy do|me&s;tic
felicity. He is wedded to his country,
and the Cor&s;icans are his children.</P>
<P>He often talked to me of marriage, told me
licentious plea&s;ures were delu&s;ive and tran&s;ient,
that I &s;hould never be truly happy till I was mar|ried,
and that he hoped to have a letter from me
&s;oon after my return home, acquainting him that
I had followed his advice, and was convinced from
experience, that he was in the right. With &s;uch
an engaging conde&s;cention did this great man be|have
<PB N="330" REF="323" MS="Y">
to me. If I could but paint his manner, all
my readers would be charmed with him.</P>
<P>He has a mind fitted for philo&s;ophical &s;pecu|lations
as well as for affairs of &s;tate. One evening
at &s;upper, he entertained us for &s;ome time with
&s;ome curious reveries and conjectures as to the na|ture
of the intelligence of bea&s;ts, with regard to
which, he ob&s;erved human knowledge was as yet
very imperfect. He in particular &s;eemed fond of
inquiring into the language of the brute creation.
He ob&s;erved that bea&s;ts fully communicate their
ideas to each other, and that &s;ome of them, &s;uch
as dogs, can form &s;everal articulate &s;ounds. In
different ages there have been people who pre|tended
to under&s;tand the language of birds and
bea&s;ts. &startq;Perhaps, &s;aid Paoli, in a thou&s;and years
we may know this as well as we know things
which appeared much more difficult to be known.&endq;
I have often &s;ince this conver&s;ation, indulged my|&s;elf
in &s;uch reveries. If it were not liable to ridi|cule,
I would &s;ay that an acquaintance with the
language of bea&s;ts would be a mo&s;t agreeable ac|qui&s;ition
to man, as it would enlarge the circle of
his &s;ocial intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>On my return to Britain, I was di&s;appointed to

was then ju&s;t publi&s;hed. My di&s;appointment
however was in a good mea&s;ure made up, by a
picture of &s;ociety, drawn by that ingenious and
worthy authour, which may be well applied to the
Cor&s;icans: &startq;There is a certain period in the
progre&s;s of &s;ociety in which mankind appear
to the greate&s;t advantage. In this period, they
have the bodily powers, and all the animal
functions remaining in full vigour. They are
bold, active, &s;teady, ardent in the love of li|berty
and their native country. Their manners
are &s;imple, their &s;ocial affections warm, and
though they are greatly influenced by the ties of
blood, yet they are generous and ho&s;pitable to
&s;trangers. Religion is univer&s;ally regarded a|mong
them, though di&s;gui&s;ed by a variety of

of tho&s;e for who&s;e happine&s;s his whole life was
employed. &startq;If, &s;aid he, I &s;hould lead into the
field an army of Cor&s;icans again&s;t an army double
their number, let me &s;peak a few words to the
Cor&s;icans, to remind them of the honour of their
country and of their brave forefathers, I do not
&s;ay that they would conquer, but I am &s;ure that
not a man of them would give way. The Cor&s;i|cans,
&s;aid he, have a &s;teady re&s;olution that would
amaze you. I wi&s;h you could &s;ee one of them die.
It is a proverb among the Genoe&s;e, &startq;I Cor&s;i me|ritano
la furca e la &s;anno &s;offrire. The Cor&s;icans
de&s;erve the gallows, and they fear not to meet it.&endq;
There is a real compliment to us in this &s;aying.&endq;</P>
<P>He told me, that in Cor&s;ica, criminals are put
to death four and twenty hours after &s;entence is
pronounced again&s;t them. &startq;This, &s;aid he, may
not be over catholick, but it is humane.&endq;</P>
<P>He went on and gave me &s;everal in&s;tances of
the Cor&s;ican &s;pirit.</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;ergeant, &s;aid he, who fell in one of our
de&s;perate actions, when ju&s;t a dying, wrote to
me thus: &startq;I &s;alute you. Take care of my aged
<PB N="333" REF="326">
father. In two hours I &s;hall be with the re&s;t who
have bravely died for their country.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A Cor&s;ican gentleman who had been taken
pri&s;oner by the Genoe&s;e, was thrown into a
dark dungeon, where he was chained to the
ground. While he was in this di&s;mal &s;ituation,
the Genoe&s;e &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to him, that if he
would accept of a commi&s;&s;ion in their &s;ervice, he
might have it. &startq;No, &s;aid he.&endq; Were I to ac|cept
of your offer, it would be with a determin|ed
purpo&s;e to take the fir&s;t opportunity of re|turning
to the &s;ervice of my country. But I
will not accept of it. For I would not have my
countrymen even &s;u&s;pect that I could be one
moment unfaithful.&endq; And he remained in his
dungeon.&endq; Paoli went on: &startq;I defy Rome, Spar|ta
or Thebes to &s;hew me thirty years of &s;uch pa|trioti&s;m
as Cor&s;ica can boa&s;t. Though the affec|tion
between relations is exceedingly &s;trong in the
Cor&s;icans, they will give up their neare&s;t relations
for the good of their country, and &s;acrifice &s;uch
as have de&s;erted to the Genoe&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>He gave me a noble in&s;tance of a Cor&s;ican's
feeling and greatne&s;s of mind: &startq;A criminal, &s;aid
he, was condemned to die. His nephew came
to me with a lady of di&s;tinction, that &s;he might
&s;olicit his pardon. The nephew's anxiety made
<PB N="334" REF="327" MS="Y">
him think that the lady did not &s;peak with &s;uf|ficient
force and earne&s;tne&s;s. He therefore ad|vanced,
and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me: &startq;Sir, is it
proper for me to &s;peak?&endq; as if he felt that it was
unlawful to make &s;uch an application. I bid him
go on. &startq;Sir, &s;aid he, with the deepe&s;t concern,
may I beg the life of my uncle? If it is grant|ed,
his relations will make a gift to the &s;tate of
a thou&s;and zechins. We will furni&s;h fifty &s;ol|diers
in pay during the &s;iege of Furiani. We
will agree that my uncle &s;hall be bani&s;hed, and
will engage that he &s;hall never return to the
i&s;land.&endq; I knew the nephew to be a man of
worth, and I an&s;wered him. You are acquainted
with the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e. Such is my
confidence in you, that if you will &s;ay that giving
your uncle a pardon would be ju&s;t, u&s;eful or ho|nourable
for Cor&s;ica, I promi&s;e you it &s;hall be
granted. He turned about, bur&s;t into tears, and
left me, &s;aying, &startq;Non vorei vendere l'onore del|la
patria per mille zechini. I would not have
the honour of our country &s;old for a thou&s;and
zechins.&endq; And his uncle &s;uffered.&endq;</P>
<P>Although the General was one of the con&s;tituent
members of the court of &s;yndicato, he &s;eldom
took his chair. He remained in his own apart|ment;
and if any of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;uits were
<PB N="335" REF="328">
determined by the &s;yndicato were not plea&s;ed
with the &s;entence, they had an audience of Paoli,
who never failed to convince them that ju&s;|tice
had been done them. This appeared to me
a nece&s;&s;ary indulgence in the infancy of govern|ment.
The Cor&s;icans having been &s;o long in
a &s;tate of anarchy, could not all at once &s;ubmit
their minds to the regular authority of ju&s;tice.
They would &s;ubmit implicitly to Paoli, becau&s;e
they love and venerate him. But &s;uch a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
is in reality being governed by their pa&s;|&s;ions.
They &s;ubmit to one for whom they have
a per&s;onal regard. They cannot be &s;aid to be
perfectly civilized till they &s;ubmit to the determi|nations
of their magi&s;trates as officers of the &s;tate,
entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. By
convincing them that the magi&s;trates judge with
abilities and uprightne&s;s, Paoli accu&s;toms the
Cor&s;icans to have that &s;alutary confidence in their
rulers, which is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring re&s;pect and
&s;tability to the government.</P>
<P>After having &s;aid much in prai&s;e of the Cor&s;i|cans,
&startq;Come, &s;aid he, you &s;hall have a proof of
what I tell you. There is a crowd in the next
room, waiting for admittance to me. I will call
in the fir&s;t I &s;ee, and you &s;hall hear him.&endq; He
who chanced to pre&s;ent him&s;elf, was a venerable
<PB N="336" REF="329" MS="Y">
old man. The General &s;hook him by the hand,
and bid him good day, with an ea&s;y kindne&s;s that
gave the aged pea&s;ant full encouragement to talk
to his Excellency with freedom. Paoli bid him
not mind me, but &s;ay on. The old man then
told him that there had been an unlucky tumult
in the village where he lived, and that two of his
&s;ons were killed. That looking upon this as a
heavy misfortune, but without malice on the part
of tho&s;e who deprived him of his &s;ons, he was
willing to have allowed it to pa&s;s without inquiry.
But his wife anxious for revenge, had made an
application to have them apprehended and pu|ni&s;hed.
That he gave his Excellency this trouble
to intreat that the greate&s;t care might be taken,
le&s;t in the heat of enmity among his neighbours,
any body &s;hould be puni&s;hed as guilty of the
blood of his &s;ons, who was really innocent of it.
There was &s;omething &s;o generous in this &s;enti|ment,
while at the &s;ame time the old man &s;eemed
full of grief for the lo&s;s of his children, that it
touched my heart in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner.
Paoli looked at me with complacency and a kind
of amiable triumph on the behaviour of the old
man, who had a flow of words and a vivacity of
ge&s;ture which fully ju&s;tified what Petrus Cyrnaeus
hath &s;aid of the Cor&s;ican eloquence: &startq;Diceres&endq;
<PB N="337" REF="330" MS="Y">
&startq;omnes e&s;&s;e bonos cau&s;idicos. You would &s;ay
they are all good pleaders.&endq;</P>
<P>I found Paoli had rea&s;on to wi&s;h that I &s;hould
talk much with his countrymen, as it gave me a
higher opinion both of him and of them. Thua|nus
has ju&s;tly &s;aid, &startq;Sunt mobilia Cor&s;orum in|genia.
The di&s;po&s;itions of the Cor&s;icans are
changeable.&endq; Yet after ten years, their attach|ment
to Paoli is as &s;trong as at the fir&s;t. Nay,
they have an enthu&s;ia&s;tick admiration of him.
&startq;Que&s;to grand&endq; uomo mandato per DIO a liberare
la patria, This great man whom GOD hath
&s;ent to free our country,&endq; was the manner in
which they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to me concerning
him.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who attended on Paoli were all men of
&s;en&s;e and abilities in their different departments.
Some of them had been in foreign &s;ervice. One
of them, Signor Suzzoni, had been long in Ger|many.
He &s;poke German to me, and recalled
to my mind, the happy days which I have pa&s;t
among that plain, hone&s;t, brave people, who of
all nations in the world, receive &s;trangers with
the greate&s;t cordiality. Signor Gian Quilico Ca&s;a
Bianca, of the mo&s;t ancient Cor&s;ican nobility, was
much my friend. He in&s;tructed me fully with
regard to the Cor&s;ican government. He had
<PB N="338" REF="331">
even the patience to &s;it by me while I wrote
down an account of it, which from conver&s;ations
with Paoli, I afterwards enlarged and improved.
I received many civilities from the Abb&eacute; Ro&s;tini,
a man of literature, and di&s;tingui&s;hed no le&s;s for
the excellency of his heart. His &s;aying of Paoli
de&s;erves to be remembered: &startq;Nous ne craig|nons
pas que notre General nous trompe ni qu'il
&s;e lai&s;&s;e tromper, We are not afraid that our
General will deceive us, nor that he will let
him&s;elf be deceived.&endq;</P>
<P>I al&s;o received civilities from Father Guelfucci
of the order of Servites, a man who&s;e talents and
virtues, united with a &s;ingular decency and &s;weet|ne&s;s
of manners, have rai&s;ed him to the honour|able
&s;tation of &s;ecretary to the General. Indeed
all the gentlemen here behaved to me in the mo&s;t
obliging manner. We walked, rode, and went
a &s;hooting together.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants and &s;oldiers were all frank, open,
lively and bold, with a certain roughne&s;s of man|ner
which agrees well with their character, and is
far from being di&s;plea&s;ing. The General gave
me an admirable in&s;tance of their plain and natu|ral,
&s;olid good &s;en&s;e. A young French Marquis,
very rich and very vain, came over to Cor&s;ica.
He had a &s;overeign contempt for the barbarous
<PB N="339" REF="332">
inhabitants, and &s;trutted about (andava a pa&s;&s;o
mi&s;urato) with prodigious airs of con&s;equence.
The Cor&s;icans beheld him with a &s;mile of ridi|cule,
and &s;aid, &startq;Let him alone, he is young.&endq;</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican pea&s;ants and &s;oldiers are very
fond of baiting cattle with the large mountain
dogs. This keeps up a ferocity among them
which totally extingui&s;hes fear. I have &s;een a
Cor&s;ican in the very heat of a baiting, run in,
drive off the dogs, &s;eize the half-frantick animal
by the horns, and lead it away. The common
people did not &s;eem much given to diver&s;ions.
I ob&s;erved &s;ome of them in the great hall of the
hou&s;e of Colonna where I was lodged, amu&s;ing
them&s;elves with playing at a &s;ort of draughts in
a very curious manner. They drew upon the
floor with chalk, a &s;ufficient number of &s;quares,
chalking one all over, and leaving one open, alter|nately;
and in&s;tead of black men and white,
they had bits of &s;tone and bits of wood. It was
an admirable burle&s;que on gaming.</P>
<P>The chief &s;atisfaction of the&s;e i&s;landers when
not engaged in war or in hunting, &s;eemed to be
that of lying at their ea&s;e in the open air, recount|ing
tales of the bravery of their countrymen, and
&s;inging &s;ongs in honour of the Cor&s;icans, and a|gain&s;t
the Genoe&s;e. Even in the night they will
<PB N="340" REF="333">
continue this pa&s;time in the open air, unle&s;s rain
forces them to retire into their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The amba&s;ciadore Ingle&s;e, The Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;adour,
as the good pea&s;ants and &s;oldiers u&s;ed
to call me, became a great favourite among them.
I got a Cor&s;ican dre&s;s made, in which I walked
about with an air of true &s;atisfaction. The Ge|neral
did me the honour to pre&s;ent me with his
own pi&s;tols, made in the i&s;land, all of Cor&s;ican
wood and iron, and of excellent workman&s;hip.
I had every other accoutrement. I even got one
of the &s;hells which had often &s;ounded the alarm
to liberty. I pre&s;erve them all with great care.</P>
<P>The Cor&s;ican pea&s;ants and &s;oldiers were quite
free and ea&s;y with me. Numbers of them u&s;ed
to come and &s;ee me of a morning, and ju&s;t go out
and in as they plea&s;ed. I did every thing in my
power to make them fond of the Briti&s;h, and bid
them hope for an alliance with us. They a&s;ked me
a thou&s;and que&s;tions about my country, all which
I cheerfully an&s;wered as well as I could.</P>
<P>One day they would needs hear me play upon
my German flute. To have told my hone&s;t natu|ral
vi&s;itants, Really gentlemen I play very ill,
and put on &s;uch airs as we do in our genteel com|panies,
would have been highly ridiculous. I
therefore immediately complied with their reque&s;t.
I gave them one or two Italian airs, and then
<PB N="341" REF="334">
&s;ome of our beautiful old Scots tunes, Gilderoy,
the La&s;s of Patie's Mill, Corn riggs are Bonny.
The pathetick &s;implicity and pa&s;toral gaiety of
the Scots mu&s;ick, will always plea&s;e tho&s;e who
have the genuine feelings of nature. The Cor&s;i|cans
were charmed with the &s;pecimens I gave them,
though I may now &s;ay that they were very indif|ferently
performed.</P>
<P>My good friends in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o to have an En|gli&s;h
&s;ong from me. I endeavoured to plea&s;e
them in this too, and was very lucky in that
which occurred to me. I &s;ung them &startq;Hearts of
oak are our &s;hips, Hearts of oak are our men.&endq;
I tran&s;lated it into Italian for them, and never did
I &s;ee men &s;o delighted with a &s;ong as the Cor&s;i|cans
were with the Hearts of oak. &startq;Cuore di
quercia, cried they, bravo Ingle&s;e.&endq; It was
quite a joyous riot. I fancied my&s;elf to be a re|cruiting
&s;ea officer. I fancied all my chorus of
Cor&s;icans aboard the Briti&s;h fleet.</P>
<P>Paoli talked very highly on pre&s;erving the in|dependency
of Cor&s;ica. &startq;We may, &s;aid he, have
foreign powers for our friends; but they mu&s;t be
Amici fuori di ca&s;a, Friends at arm's length.
We may make an alliance, but we will not &s;ub|mit
our&s;elves to the dominion of the greate&s;t na|tion
in Europe, This people who have done &s;o
<PB N="342" REF="335" MS="Y">
much for liberty, would be hewn in pieces man
by man, rather than allow Cor&s;ica to be &s;unk into
the territories of another country. Some years
ago, when a fal&s;e rumour was &s;pread that I had a
de&s;ign to yield up Cor&s;ica to the Emperour, a
Cor&s;ican came to me, and addre&s;&s;ed me in great
agitation: &startq;What! &s;hall the blood of &s;o many
heroes, who have &s;acrificed their lives for the
freedom of Cor&s;ica, &s;erve only to tinge the pur|ple
of a foreign prince!&endq;</P>
<P>I mentioned to him the &s;cheme of an alliance
between Great Britain and Cor&s;ica. Paoli with
politene&s;s and dignity waved the &s;ubject, by &s;ay|ing,
&startq;The le&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;tance we have from allies, the
greater our glory.&endq; He &s;eemed hurt by our treat|ment
of his country. He mentioned the &s;evere
proclamation at the la&s;t peace, in which the brave
i&s;landers were called the Rebels of Cor&s;ica. He
&s;aid with a con&s;cious pride and proper feeling,
&startq;Rebels! I did not expect that from Great Britain.&endq;</P>
<P>He however &s;hewed his great re&s;pect for the
Briti&s;h nation, and I could &s;ee he wi&s;hed much
to be in friend&s;hip with us. When I a&s;ked him
what I could po&s;&s;ibly do in return for all his
goodne&s;s to me, he replied, &startq;Solamente di&s;in|gannate
il &s;uo corte, Only undeceive your court.
Tell them what you have &s;een here. They will
<PB N="343" REF="336">
be curious to a&s;k you. A man come from Cor|&s;ica
will be like a man come from the Antipodes.&endq;</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch hopes as a man of &s;en&s;ibility
would in my &s;ituation naturally form. He &s;aw at
lea&s;t one Briton devoted to his cau&s;e. I threw
out many flattering ideas of future political events,
imaged the Briti&s;h and the Cor&s;icans &s;trictly unit|ed
both in commerce and in war, and de&s;cribed
the blunt kindne&s;s and admiration with which the
hearty, generous common people of England
would treat the brave Cor&s;icans.</P>
<P>I in&s;en&s;ibly got the better of his re&s;erve upon
this head. My flow of gay ideas relaxed his &s;eve|rity,
and brightened up his humour. &startq;Do you re|member,
&s;aid he, the little people in A&s;ia who
were in danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed by the great
king of A&s;&s;yria, till they addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to
the Romans: and the Romans, with the noble
&s;pirit of a great and free nation, &s;tood forth, and
would not &s;uffer the great king to de&s;troy the little
people, but made an alliance with them?&endq;</P>
<P>He made no ob&s;ervations upon this beautiful
piece of hi&s;tory. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee his allu&s;ion to
his own nation and ours.</P>
<P>When the General related this piece of hi&s;to|ry
to me, I was negligent enough not to a&s;k him
what little people he meant. As the &s;tory made
<PB N="344" REF="337">
a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon me, upon my return to
Britain I &s;earched a variety of books to try if I
could find it, but in vain. I therefore took the
liberty in one of my letters to Paoli, to beg he
would let me know it. He told me the little
people was the Jews, that the &s;tory was related
by &s;everal ancient authours, but that I would find
it told with mo&s;t preci&s;ion and energy in the
eighth chapter of the fir&s;t book of the Macca|bees.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t book of the Maccabees, though not
received into the Prote&s;tant canon, is allowed by
all the learned to be an authentic hi&s;tory. I
have read Paoli's favourite &s;tory with much &s;ati&s;|faction,
and, as in &s;everal circum&s;tances, it very
well applies to Great Britain and Cor&s;ica, is told
with great eloquence, and furni&s;hes a fine model
for an alliance, I &s;hall make no apology for tran|&s;cribing
the mo&s;t intere&s;ting ver&s;es.</P>
<P>&startq;Now Judas had heard of the fame of the
Romans, that they were mighty and valiant
men, and &s;uch as would lovingly accept all
that joined them&s;elves unto them, and make a
league of amity with all that came unto them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And that they were men of great valour.
It was told him al&s;o of their wars and noble
acts which they had done among&s;t the Gala|tians,&endq;
<PB N="345" REF="338">
&startq;and how they had conquered them, and

<P>&startq;And what they had done in the country of
Spain, for the winning of the mines of the &s;il|ver

<P>&startq;And that by their policy and patience they
had conquered all the place, though it were ve|ry
far from them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was told him be&s;ides, how they de&s;troyed
and brought under their dominion, all other
kingdoms and i&s;les that at any time re&s;i&s;ted
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But with their friends, and &s;uch as relied
upon them, they kept amity: and that they had
conquered kingdoms both far and near, in&s;o|much
as all that heard of their name were afraid
of them:&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Al&s;o, that whom they would help to a king|dom,
tho&s;e reign; and whom again they
would, they di&s;place: finally, that they were
greatly exalted:&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Moreover, how they had made for them&s;elves
a &s;enate-hou&s;e, wherein three hundred and twen|ty
men &s;at in council daily, con&s;ulting alway for
the people, to the end that they might be well
ordered.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="339">
&startq;In con&s;ideration of the&s;e things Judas cho&s;e
Eupolemus the &s;on of John the &s;on of Accos,

Rome, to make a league of amity and confe|deracy
with them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And to intreat them that they would take
the yoke from them, for they &s;aw that the king|dom
of the Grecians did oppre&s;s I&s;rael with &s;er|vitude.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They went therefore to Rome, which was a
very great journey, and came into the &s;enate,

<P>&startq;Judas Maccabeus, with his brethren, and the
people of the Jews, have &s;ent us unto you, to
make a confederacy and peace with you, and
that we might be regi&s;tered your confederates
and friends.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So that matter plea&s;ed the Romans well.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And this is the copy of the epi&s;tle which the
&s;enate wrote back again, in tables of bra&s;s,

<P>&startq;Howbeit, if hereafter the one party or the
other, &s;hall think meet to add or dimini&s;h any
thing they may do it at their plea&s;ures, and&endq;

&startq;what&s;oever they &s;hall add or take away, &s;hall

<P>&startq;And, as touching the evils that Demetrius
doth to the Jews, we have written unto him,
&s;aying, Wherefore ha&s;t thou made thy yoke

<P>I will venture to a&s;k whether the Romans ap|pear,
in any one in&s;tance of their hi&s;tory, more
truly great than they do here.</P>
<P>Paoli &s;aid, &startq;If a man would pre&s;erve the ge|nerous
glow of patrioti&s;m, he mu&s;t not rea&s;on too
much. Mare&s;chal Saxe rea&s;oned; and carried
the arms of France into the heart of Germany,
his own country. I act from &s;entiment, not from
rea&s;onings.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Virtuous &s;entiments and habits, &s;aid he, are
beyond philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings, which are not &s;o
&s;trong, and are continually varying. If all the
profe&s;&s;ours in Europe were formed into one &s;oci|ety,
it would no doubt be a &s;ociety very re&s;pect|able,
and we &s;hould there be entertained with the&endq;
<PB N="349" REF="342">
&startq;be&s;t moral le&s;&s;ons. Yet I believe I &s;hould find
more real virtue in a &s;ociety of good pea&s;ants in
&s;ome little village in the heart of your i&s;land. It
might be &s;aid of the&s;e two &s;ocieties, as was &s;aid
of Demo&s;thenes and Themi&s;tocles, &startq;Illius dicta,
hujus facta magis valebant, The one was power|ful
in words, but the other in deeds.&endq;</P>
<P>This kind of conver&s;ation led me to tell him
how much I had &s;uffered from anxious &s;peculati|ons.
With a mind naturally inclined to melan|choly,
and a keen de&s;ire of enquiry, I had inten&s;e|ly
applied my&s;elf to metaphy&s;ical re&s;earches, and
rea&s;oned beyond my depth, on &s;uch &s;ubjects as it
is not given to man to know. I told him I had
rendered my mind a comera ob&s;cura, that in the
very heat of youth I felt the &startq;non e&s;t tanti,&endq; the
&startq;omnia vanitas&endq; of one who has exhau&s;ted all the
&s;weets of his being, and is weary with dull repeti|tion.
I told him that I had almo&s;t become for
ever incapable of taking a part in active life.</P>
<P>&startq;All this, &s;aid Paoli, is melancholy. I have
al&s;o &s;tudied metaphy&s;icks. I know the arguments
for fate and free-will, for the materiality and im|materiality
of the &s;oul, and even the &s;ubtile ar|guments
for and again&s;t the exi&s;tence of matter.
Ma la&s;ciamo que&s;te di&s;pute ai ozio&s;i, But let us
leave the&s;e di&s;putes to the idle. Io tengo &s;empre
<PB N="350" REF="343">
fermo un gran pen&s;iero, I hold always firm one
great object. I never feel a moment of de&s;pon|dency.&endq;</P>
<P>The contemplation of &s;uch a character really
exi&s;ting, was of more &s;ervice to me than all I had
been able to draw from books, from conver&s;ati|on,
or from the exertions of my own mind. I had
often enough formed the idea of a man continu|ally
&s;uch, as I could conceive in my be&s;t moments.
But this idea appeared like the ideas we are taught
in the &s;chools to form of things which may exi&s;t,
but do not; of &s;eas of milk, and &s;hips of amber.
But I &s;aw my highe&s;t idea realized in Paoli. It
was impo&s;&s;ible for me, &s;peculate as I plea&s;ed, to
have a little opinion of human nature in him.</P>
<P>One morning I remember, I came in upon
him without ceremony, while he was dre&s;&s;ing.
I was glad to have an opportunity of &s;eeing him
in tho&s;e tea&s;ing moments, when according to the
Duke de Rochefoucault, no man is a hero to his
valet de chambre. That lively nobleman who
has a malicious plea&s;ure in endeavouring to dive&s;t
human nature of its dignity, by exhibiting parti|al
views, and exaggerating faults, would have
owned that Paoli was every moment of his life a
hero.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="344">
Paoli told me that from his earlie&s;t years, he
had in view the important &s;tation which he now
holds; &s;o that his &s;entiments mu&s;t ever have been
great. I a&s;ked him how one of &s;uch elevated
thoughts could &s;ubmit with any degree of pati|ence,
to the unmeaning ceremonies and poor di&s;|cour&s;e
of genteel &s;ociety, which he certainly was
obliged to do while an officer at Naples. &startq;O, &s;aid
he, I managed it very ea&s;ily. Ero conno&s;ciuto
per una te&s;ta &s;ingolare, I was known to be a &s;in|gular
man. I talked and joked, and was merry;
but I never &s;at down to play; I went and came
as I plea&s;ed. The mirth I like is what is ea&s;y and
unaffected. Je ne puis &s;ouffrir long temps les di|&s;ieurs
de bons mots, I cannot endure long the
&s;ayers of good things.&endq;</P>
<P>How much &s;uperiour is this great man's idea
of agreeable conver&s;ation to that of profe&s;&s;ed
wits, who are continually &s;training for &s;mart re|marks,
and lively repartees. They put them|&s;elves
to much pain in order to plea&s;e; and yet
plea&s;e le&s;s than if they would ju&s;t appear as they
naturally feel them&s;elves. A company of pro|fe&s;&s;ed
wits has always appeared to me, like a
company of artificers employed in &s;ome very nice
and difficult work, which they are under a nece&s;&s;i|ty
of performing.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="345">
Though calm and fully ma&s;ter of him&s;elf,
Paoli is animated with an extraordinary degree of
vivacity. Except when indi&s;po&s;ed or greatly fa|tigued,
he never &s;its down but at meals. He is
perpetually in motion, walking bri&s;kly backwards
and forwards. Mr. Samuel John&s;on, who&s;e com|prehen&s;ive
and vigourous under&s;tanding, has by
long ob&s;ervation, attained to a perfect knowledge
of human nature, when treating of biography,
has this reflection: &startq;There are many invi&s;ible cir|cum&s;tances
which, whether we read as inquiries
after natural or moral knowledge; whether
we intend to enlarge our &s;cience, or encrea&s;e our
virtue, are more important than publick occur|rences,
Thus Sallu&s;t&s; the great ma&s;ter of nature,
has not forgotten in his account of Catiline, to
remark, that &startq;his walk was now quick, and a|gain
&s;low,&endq; as an indication of a mind revolving
&s;omething with violent commotion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rambler, No. 60.</NOTE>.&endq; Ever
mindful of the wi&s;dom of the Rambler, I have
accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to mark the &s;mall peculiarities
of character. Paoli's being perpetually in moti|tion,
nay his being &s;o agitated that, as the &s;ame
Sallu&s;t al&s;o &s;ays of Catiline, &startq;Neque vigiliis,
neque quietibus &s;edari poterat, He could not be
quieted either by watching or by repo&s;e,&endq; are
<PB N="353" REF="346">
indications of his being as active and indefati|gable
as Catiline, but from a very different cau&s;e:
The con&s;piratour from &s;chemes of ruin and de|&s;truction
to Rome; the patriot from &s;chemes of
liberty and felicity to Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>Paoli told me that the vivacity of his mind
was &s;uch, that he could not &s;tudy above ten mi|nutes
at a time. &startq;La te&s;ta mi rompa, My head
is like to break, &s;aid he. I can never write
my lively ideas with my own hand. In writing,
they e&s;cape from my mind. I call the Abb&eacute;
Guelfucci, Allons pre&s;to, pigliate li pen&s;ieri,
Come quickly, take my thoughts; and he writes
them.&endq;</P>
<P>Paoli has a memory like that of Themi&s;tocles;
for I was a&s;&s;ured that he knows the names of al|mo&s;t
all the people in the i&s;land, their characters,
and their connexions. His memory as a man of
learning, is no le&s;s uncommon. He has the be&s;t
part of the cla&s;&s;icks by heart, and he has a happy
talent in applying them with propriety, which is
rarely to be found. This talent is not always
to be reckoned pedantry. The in&s;tances in which
Paoli is &s;hewn to di&s;play it, are a proof to the
contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="347">
I have heard Paoli recount the revolutions of
one of the ancient &s;tates, with an energy and a
rapidity which &s;hewed him to be ma&s;ter of the
&s;ubject, to be perfectly acquainted with every
&s;pring and movement of the various events. I
have heard him give what the French call &startq;Une
catalogue rai&s;onn&eacute;e&endq; of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed men
in antiquity. His characters of them were con|ci&s;e,
nervous and ju&s;t. I regret that the fire with
which he &s;poke upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;o dazzled
me, that I could not recollect his &s;ayings &s;o as to
write them down when I retired from his pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>He ju&s;t lives in the times of antiquity. He
&s;aid to me, &startq;A young man who would form his
mind to glory, mu&s;t not read modern memoirs;
m&agrave; Plutarcho, m&agrave; Tito Livio; but Plutarch and
Titus Livius.&endq;</P>
<P>I have &s;een him fall into a &s;ort of reverie, and
break out into &s;allies of the grande&s;t and noble&s;t
enthu&s;ia&s;m. I recollect two in&s;tances of this.
&startq;What a thought? that thou&s;ands owe their hap|pine&s;s
to you!&endq; And throwing him&s;elf into an
attitude, as if he &s;aw the lofty mountain of fame
before him: &startq;THERE is my object! (pointing to
the &s;ummit), if I fall, I fall at lea&s;t THERE (point|ing
a good way up), magnis tamen excidit au&s;is.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="348">
I ventured to rea&s;on like a libertine, that I
might be confirmed in virtuous principles by &s;o
illu&s;trious a Preceptour. I made light of moral
feelings. I argued that con&s;cience was vague and
uncertain; that there was hardly any vice but
what men might be found who have been guilty
of it without remor&s;e. &startq;But, &s;aid he, there is no
man who has not a horrour at &s;ome vice. Dif|ferent
vices and different virtues have the &s;trong|e&s;t
impre&s;&s;ion, on different men; Ma il virt&ugrave;
in a&s;tratto &egrave; il nutrimento dei no&s;tri cuori, But
virtue in the ab&s;tract, is the food of our hearts.&endq;</P>
<P>Talking of Providence, he &s;aid to me with
that earne&s;tne&s;s with which a man &s;peaks who is
anxious to be believed: &startq;I tell you on the word
of an hone&s;t man, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me not to
be per&s;uaded that GOD interpo&s;es to give freedom
to Cor&s;ica. A people oppre&s;&s;ed like the Cor&s;icans,
are certainly worthy of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. When
we were in the mo&s;t de&s;perate circum&s;tances, I
never lo&s;t courage, tru&s;ting as I did in Providence.&endq;
I ventured to object; But why has not Provi|dence
interpo&s;ed &s;ooner? He replied with a noble,
&s;erious and devout air, &startq;Becau&s;e his ways are un|&s;earchable.
I adore him for what he hath done.
I revere him in what he hath not done.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="349">
I gave Paoli the character of my revered
friend Mr. Samuel John&s;on. I have often regret|ed
that illu&s;trious men, &s;uch as humanity produces
a few times in the revolution of many ages,
&s;hould not &s;ee each other; and when &s;uch ari&s;e
in the &s;ame age, though at the di&s;tance of half the
globe, I have been a&s;toni&s;hed how they could
forbear to meet.</P>
<P>&startq;As &s;teel &s;harpneth &s;teel, &s;o doth a man the
countenance of his friend,&endq; &s;ays the wi&s;e mo|narch.
What an idea may we not form of an
interview between &s;uch a &s;cholar and philo&s;opher
as Mr. John&s;on, and &s;uch a legi&s;latour and gene|ral
as Paoli!</P>
<P>I repeated to Paoli &s;everal of Mr. John&s;on's
&s;ayings, &s;o remarkable for &s;trong &s;en&s;e and origi|nal
humour. I now recollect the&s;e two.</P>
<P>When I told Mr. John&s;on that a certain au|thour
affected in conver&s;ation to maintain, that
there was no di&s;tinction between virtue and vice,
he &s;aid, &startq;Why, Sir, if the fellow does not think
as he &s;peaks, he is lying; and I &s;ee not what
honour he can propo&s;e to him&s;elf from having
the character of a lyar. But if he does really
think that there is no di&s;tinction between virtue
and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our hou&s;es
let us count our &s;poons.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="350">
Of modern infidels and innovatours, he &s;aid,
&startq;Sir, the&s;e are all vain men, and will gratify
them&s;elves at any expence. Truth will not af|ford
&s;ufficient food to their vanity; &s;o they have
betaken them&s;elves to errour. Truth, Sir, is
a cow which will yield &s;uch people no more
milk; and &s;o they are gone to milk the bull.&endq;</P>
<P>I felt an elation of mind to &s;ee Paoli delighted
with the &s;ayings of Mr. John&s;on, and to hear him
tran&s;late them with Italian energy to the Cor&s;ican
heroes.</P>
<P>I repeated Mr. John&s;on's &s;ayings as nearly as I
could, in his own peculiar forcible language, for
which, prejudiced or little criticks have taken
upon them to find fault with him. He is above
making any an&s;wer to them; but I have found a
&s;ufficient an&s;wer in a general remark in one of his
excellent papers: &startq;Difference of thoughts will
produce difference of language. He that thinks
with more extent than another, will want words
of larger meaning.&endq;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idler, No. 70.</NOTE></P>
<P>I hope to be pardoned for this digre&s;&s;ion,
wherein I pay a ju&s;t tribute of veneration and
gratitude to one from who&s;e writings and conver|&s;ation
I have received in&s;tructions of which I ex|perience
the value in every &s;cene of my life.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="351">
During Paoli's admini&s;tration, there have been
few laws made in Cor&s;ica. He mentioned one
which he has found very efficacious in curbing
that vindictive &s;pirit of the Cor&s;icans, of which I
have &s;aid a good deal in a former part of this
work. There was among the Cor&s;icans a mo&s;t
dreadful &s;pecies of revenge, called &startq;Vendetta tra&s;|ver&s;a,
Collateral revenge,&endq; which Petrus Cyrnaeus
candidly acknowledges. It was this: If a man
had received an injury, and could not find a pro|per
opportunity to be revenged on his enemy
per&s;onally, he revenged him&s;elf on one of his ene|my's
relations. So barbarous a practice, was the
&s;ource of innumerable a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations. Paoli know|ing
that the point of honour was every thing to
the Cor&s;icans, oppo&s;ed it to the progre&s;s of the
blacke&s;t of crimes, fortified by long habits. He
made a law, by which it was provided, that this
collateral revenge &s;hould not only be puni&s;hed
with death, as ordinary murther, but the memory
of the offender &s;hould be di&s;graced for ever by a
pillar of infamy. He al&s;o had it enacted that
the &s;ame &s;tatute &s;hould extend to the violatours of
an oath of reconciliation, once made.</P>
<P>By thus combating a vice &s;o de&s;tructive, he
has, by a kind of &s;hock of oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions, re|duced
the fiery Cor&s;icans to a &s;tate of mildne&s;s,
<PB N="359" REF="352">
and he a&s;&s;ured me that they were now all fully
&s;en&s;ible of the equity of that law.</P>
<P>While I was at Sollacar&ograve;, information was re|ceived,
that the poor wretch who &s;trangled the
woman at the in&s;tigation of his mi&s;tre&s;s, had con|&s;ented
to accept of his life, upon condition of
becoming hangman. This made a great noi&s;e
among the Cor&s;icans, who were enraged at the
creature, and &s;aid their nation was now di&s;graced.
Paoli did not think &s;o. He &s;aid to me, &startq;I am
glad of this. It will be of &s;ervice. It will con|tribute
to form us to a ju&s;t &s;ubordination. We
have as yet too great an equality among us. As
we mu&s;t have Cor&s;ican taylours and Cor&s;ican &s;hoe|makers,
we mu&s;t al&s;o have a Cor&s;ican hangman.&endq;</P>
<P>I could not help being of a different opinion.
The occupations of a taylour and a &s;hoemaker
though mean, are not odious. When I afterwards
met M. Rou&s;&s;eau in England, and made him a re|port
of my Cor&s;ican expedition, he agreed with me
in thinking that it would be &s;omething noble for
the brave i&s;landers, to be able to &s;ay that there
was not a Cor&s;ican but who would rather &s;uffer
death, than become a hangman; and he al&s;o agreed
with me, that it might have a good effect to have
always a Genoe&s;e for the hangman of Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="353">
I mu&s;t however do the Genoe&s;e the ju&s;tice to
ob&s;erve, that Paoli told me, that even one of them
had &s;uffered death in Cor&s;ica, rather than con&s;ent to
become hangman. When I, from a keenne&s;s na|tural
enough in a Briton born with an abhorrence
at tyranny, talked with violence again&s;t the Ge|noe&s;e,
Paoli &s;aid with a moderation and candour
which ought to do him honour even with the re|publick,
&startq;It is true the Genoe&s;e are our enemies;
but let us not forget, that they are the de&s;cendants
of tho&s;e worthies, who carried their arms beyond
the Helle&s;pont.&endq;</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance in Paoli's character
which I pre&s;ent to my readers with caution, know|ing
how much it may be ridiculed, in an age when
mankind are &s;o fond of incredulity, that they &s;eem
to pique them&s;elves in contracting their circle of
belief as much as po&s;&s;ible. But I con&s;ider this
infidel rage as but a temporary mode of the human
under&s;tanding, and am well per&s;uaded that e'er
long we &s;hall return to a more calm philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>I own I cannot help thinking that though we
may boa&s;t &s;ome improvements in &s;cience, and in
&s;hort, &s;uperiour degrees of knowledge in things
where our faculties can fully reach, yet we &s;hould
not a&s;&s;ume to our&s;elves &s;ounder judgements than
tho&s;e of our fathers; I will therefore venture to
<PB N="361" REF="354">
relate that Paoli has at times extraordinary im|pre&s;&s;ions
of di&s;tant and future events.</P>
<P>The way in which I di&s;covered it, was this.
Being very de&s;irous of &s;tudying &s;o exalted a cha|racter,
I &s;o far pre&s;umed upon his goodne&s;s to me,
as to take the liberty of a&s;king him a thou&s;and
que&s;tions with regard to the mo&s;t minute and pri|vate
circum&s;tances of his life. Having a&s;ked him
one day when &s;ome of his nobles were pre&s;ent, whe|ther
a mind, &s;o active as his, was not employed e|ven
in &s;leep, and if he u&s;ed to dream much. Signor
Ca&s;a Bianca &s;aid with an air and tone which im|plied
&s;omething of importance, &startq;Si, &s;i &s;ogna, Yes,
he dreams.&endq; And upon my a&s;king him to explain
his meaning, he told me that the General had often
&s;een in his dreams, what afterwards came to pa&s;s.
Paoli confirmed this by &s;everal in&s;tances. Said he,
&startq;I can give you no clear explanation of it. I on|ly
tell you facts. Sometimes I have been mi&s;tak|en,
but in general, the&s;e vi&s;ions have proved true.
I cannot &s;ay what may be the agency of invi&s;ible
&s;pirits. They certainly mu&s;t know more than
we do; and there is nothing ab&s;urd in &s;uppo&s;ing
that GOD &s;hould permit them to communicate
their knowledge to us.&endq;</P>
<P>He went into a mo&s;t curious and plea&s;ing
di&s;qui&s;ition, on a &s;ubject, which the late inge|nious
<PB N="362" REF="355">
Mr. Baxter has treated in a very philo&s;o|phical
manner, in his Inquiry into the Nature of
the Human Soul; a book which may be read
with as much delight, and &s;urely with more
advantage than the works of tho&s;e who endea|vour
to de&s;troy our belief. Belief is favourable
to the human mind, were it for nothing el&s;e but
to furni&s;h it entertainment. An infidel I &s;hould
think, mu&s;t frequently &s;uffer from ennui.</P>
<P>It was perhaps affectation in Socrates to &s;ay,
that all he had learned to know was that he
knew nothing. But &s;urely it is a mark of wi&s;|dom,
to be &s;en&s;ible of the limited extent of hu|man
knowledge, to examine with reverence the
ways of GOD, nor pre&s;umptuou&s;ly reject any opi|nion
which has been held by the judicious and
the learned, becau&s;e it has been made a cloak for
artifice, or had a variety of fictions rai&s;ed upon it,
by credulity.</P>

<P>The my&s;terious circum&s;tance in Paoli's cha|racter
which I have ventured to relate, is univer|&s;ally

by &s;igns. When I a&s;ked one of them, if there

<P>It may be &s;aid that the General has indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
propagated this opinion, in order that he
might have more authority in civilizing a rude
and ferocious people, as Lycurgus pretended to
have the &s;anction of the oracle at Delphos, as Nu|ma
gave it out that he had frequent interviews
with the nymph Egeria, or as Marius per&s;uaded
the Romans, that he received divine communica|tions
from a hind. But I cannot allow my&s;elf to
&s;uppo&s;e that Paoli ever required the aid of pious
frauds.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="357">
Paoli though never familiar, has the mo&s;t per|fect
ea&s;e of behaviour. This is a mark of a real
great character. The di&s;tance and re&s;erve which
&s;ome of our modern nobility affect, is, becau&s;e
nobility is now little el&s;e than a name in compa|ri&s;on
of what it was in ancient times. In ancient
times, noblemen lived at their country &s;eats, like
princes, in ho&s;pitable grandeur. They were men
of power, and every one of them could bring
hundreds of followers into the field. They were
then open and affable. Some of our modern no|bility
are &s;o anxious to pre&s;erve an appearance of
dignity which they are &s;en&s;ible cannot bear an
examination, that they are afraid to let you come
near them. Paoli is not &s;o. Tho&s;e about him
come into his apartment at all hours, wake him,
help him on with his clothes, are perfectly free
from re&s;traint; yet they know their di&s;tance, and
awed by his real greatne&s;s, never lo&s;e their re&s;pect
for him.</P>
<P>Though thus ea&s;y of acce&s;s, particular care is
taken again&s;t &s;uch attempts upon the life of the
illu&s;trious Chief, as he has good rea&s;on to appre|hend
from the Genoe&s;e, who have &s;o often em|ployed
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination merely in a political view, and
who would gain &s;o much by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Paoli.
A certain number of &s;oldiers are continually on
<PB N="365" REF="358">
guard upon him; and as &s;till clo&s;er guards, he
has &s;ome faithful Cor&s;ican dogs. Of the&s;e five or
&s;ix &s;leep, &s;ome in his chamber, and &s;ome at the
out&s;ide of the chamber-door. He treats them with
great kindne&s;s, and they are &s;trongly attached to
him. They are extremely &s;agacious, and know
all his friends and attendants. Were any per&s;on
to approach the General during the darkne&s;s of
the night, they would in&s;tantly tear him in pieces.
Having dogs for his attendants, is another cir|cum&s;tance
about Paoli &s;imilar to the heroes of
antiquity. Homer repre&s;ents Telemachus &s;o at|tended:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></P>
<P>HOMER. Ody&s;&s;. lib. ii. I. 11.</P>
<P>Two dogs a faithful guard attend behind.</P>
<P>POPE.</P>
<P>But the de&s;cription given of the family of Patro|clus
applies better to Paoli:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></P>
<P>HOMER. Iliad. lib. xxiii. I. 73.</P>
<P>nine large dogs dome&s;tick at his board.</P>
<P>POPE.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope in his notes on the &s;econd book of
the Ody&s;&s;ey, is much plea&s;ed with dogs being in|troduced,
as it furni&s;hes an agreeable in&s;tance of
<PB N="366" REF="359">
ancient &s;implicity. He ob&s;erves that Virgil
thought this circum&s;tance worthy of his imita|tion,
in de&s;cribing old Evander. So we read of
Syphax general of the Numidians, &startq;Syphax inter
duos canes &s;tans, Scipionem appellavit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I mention this on the authority of an excellent &s;cholar, and one of our be&s;t writers, Mr. Jo&s;eph Warton in his notes on the Aeneid; for I have not been able to find the pa&s;&s;age in Livy which he quotes.</NOTE>, Syphax
&s;tanding between two dogs called to Scipio.&endq;</P>
<P>Talking of courage, he made a very ju&s;t di&s;|tinction
between con&s;titutional courage and cou|rage
from reflection. &startq;Sir Thomas More, &s;aid
he, would not probably have mounted a breach
&s;o well as a &s;ergeant who had never thought of
death. But a &s;ergeant would not on a &s;caffold,
have &s;hewn the calm re&s;olution of Sir Thomas
More.&endq;</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject he told me a very remarkable
anecdote, which happened during the la&s;t war in
Italy. At the &s;iege of Tortona, the commander
of the army which lay before the town, ordered
Carew an Iri&s;h officer in the &s;ervice of Naples,
to advance with a detachment to a particular po&s;t.
<PB N="367" REF="360">
Having given his orders, he whi&s;pered to Carew:
&startq;Sir, I know you to be a gallant man. I have
therefore put you upon this duty. I tell you in
confidence, it is certain death for you all. I
place you there to make the enemy &s;pring a
mine below you.&endq; Carew made a bow to the
general, and led on his men in &s;ilence to the
dreadful po&s;t. He there &s;tood with an undaunted
countenance, and having called to one of the &s;ol|diers
for a draught of wine, &startq;Here, &s;aid he, I
drink to all tho&s;e who bravely fall in battle.&endq;
Fortunately at that in&s;tant Tortona capitulated,
and Carew e&s;caped. But he had thus a full op|portunity
of di&s;playing a rare in&s;tance of deter|mined
intrepidity. It is with plea&s;ure that I re|cord
an anecdote &s;o much to the honour of a
gentleman of that nation, on which illiberal re|flections
are too often thrown, by tho&s;e of whom
it little de&s;erves them. Whatever may be the
rough jokes of wealthy in&s;olence, or the en|vious
&s;arca&s;ms of needy jealou&s;y, the Iri&s;h have
ever been, and will continue to be, highly re|garded
upon the continent.</P>
<P>Paoli's per&s;onal authority among the Cor&s;i|cans
&s;truck me much. I have &s;een a crowd of
them with eagerne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, endeavour|ing
to approach him, as if they would have bur&s;t
into his appartment by force. In vain did the
<PB N="368" REF="361">
guards attempt to re&s;train them; but when he
called to them in a tone of firmne&s;s, &startq;Non c'&egrave; ora
ricor&s;o, No audience now,&endq; they were hu&s;hed at
once.</P>
<P>He one afternoon gave us an entertaining di&s;|&s;ertation
on the ancient art of war. He ob&s;erved
that the ancients allowed of little baggage, which
they very properly called &startq;impedimenta;&endq; where|as
the moderns burden them&s;elves with it to &s;uch
a degree, that 50,000 of our pre&s;ent &s;oldiers are
allowed as much baggage as was formerly thought
&s;ufficient for all the armies of the Roman empire.
He &s;aid it was good for &s;oldiers to be heavy arm|ed,
as it renders them proportionably robu&s;t; and
he remarked that when the Romans lightened
their arms, the troops became enfeebled. He
made a very curious ob&s;ervation with regard to the
towers full of armed men, which we are told were
borne on the backs of their elephants. He &s;aid
it mu&s;t be a mi&s;take; for if the towers were broad,
there would not be room for them on the backs of
elephants; for he and a friend who was an able cal|culatour,
had mea&s;ured a very large elephant at Na|ples,
and made a computation of the &s;pace nece&s;&s;ary
to hold the number of men &s;aid to be contained in
<PB N="369" REF="362">
tho&s;e towers, and they found that the back of
the broade&s;t elephant would not be &s;ufficient, af|ter
making the fulle&s;t allowance for what might
be hung by ballance on either &s;ide of the animal.
If again the towers were high, they would
fall; for he did not think it at all probable, that
the Romans had the art of tying on &s;uch mon|&s;trous
machines at a time when they had not
learnt the u&s;e even of girths to their &s;addles. He
&s;aid he did not give too much credit to the fi|gures
on Trajan's pillar, many of which were un|doubtedly
fal&s;e. He &s;aid it was his opinion, that
tho&s;e towers were only drawn by the elephants;
an opinion founded in probability, and free from
the difficulties of that which has been commonly
received.</P>
<P>Talking of various &s;chemes of life, fit for a
man of &s;pirit and education; I mentioned to
him that of being a foreign mini&s;ter. He &s;aid
he thought it a very agreeable employment for
a man of parts and addre&s;s, during &s;ome years of
his life. &startq;In that &s;ituation, &s;aid he, a man will
in&s;en&s;ibly attain to a greater knowledge of men
and manners, and a more perfect acquaintance
with the politicks of Europe. He will be pro|moted
according to the returns which he makes&endq;
<PB N="350" REF="363">
&startq;to his court. They mu&s;t be accurate, di&s;tinct,
without fire or ornament. He may &s;ubjoin his
own opinion, but he mu&s;t do it with great mo|de&s;ty.
The mini&s;try at home are proud.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid the greate&s;t happine&s;s was not in glo|ry,
but in goodne&s;s; and that Penn in his Ame|rican
colony, where he had e&s;tabli&s;hed a people
in quiet and contentment, was happier than Alex|ander
the Great after de&s;troying multitudes at
the conque&s;t of Thebes. He ob&s;erved that the
hi&s;tory of Alexander is ob&s;cure and dubious; for
his captains who divided his kingdom, were too
bu&s;y to record his life and actions, and would at
any rate wi&s;h to render him odious to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Never was I &s;o thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of my
own defects as while I was in Cor&s;ica. I felt
how &s;mall were my abilities, and how little I
knew. Ambitious to be the companion of Paoli,
and to under&s;tand a country and a people which
rou&s;ed me &s;o much, I wi&s;hed to be a Sir James
Mac Donald<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir James MacDonald baronet of the i&s;le of Sky, who at the age of one and twenty, had the learning and abilities of a profe&s;&s;our and a &s;tate&s;man, with the accompli&s;hments of a man of the world. Eton and Oxford will ever remember him as one of their greate&s;t ornaments. He was well known to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in Europe, but was carried off from all their expectations. He died at Fre&s;cati, near Rome, in 1765. Had he lived a little longer, I believe I &s;hould have prevailed with him to vi&s;it Cor&s;ica.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="364">
The la&s;t day which I &s;pent with Paoli, appear|ed
of ine&s;timable value. I thought him more than
u&s;ually great and amiable, when I was upon
the eve of parting from him. The night before
my departure, a little incident happened which
&s;hewed him in a mo&s;t agreeable light. When
the &s;ervants were bringing in the de&s;ert after
&s;upper, one of them chanced to let fall a plate
of walnuts. In&s;tead of flying into a pa&s;&s;ion at
what the man could not help, Paoli &s;aid with
a &s;mile, &startq;No matter;&endq; and turning to me, &startq;It
is a good &s;ign for you, Sir, Tempus e&s;t &s;pargere

omen: You mu&s;t go home to your own
country, and marry &s;ome fine woman whom you
really like. I &s;hall rejoice to hear of it.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a pretty allu&s;ion to the Roman ce|remony
at weddings, of &s;cattering walnuts. So

<P>When I again a&s;ked Paoli if it was po&s;&s;ible
for me in any way to &s;hew him my great re&s;pect
and attachment, he replied, &startq;Ricordatevi che Io
vi &s;ia amico, e &s;crivetemi. Remember that I am
your friend, and write to me.&endq; I &s;aid I hoped
that when he honoured me with a letter, he would
write not only as a commander, but as a philo&s;o|pher
and a man of letters. He took me by the
hand, and &s;aid, &startq;As a friend.&endq; I dare not tran|&s;cribe
from my private notes the feelings which I
had at this interview. I &s;hould perhaps appear
too enthu&s;ia&s;tick. I took leave of Paoli with re|gret
and agitation, not without &s;ome hopes of
&s;eeing him again. From having known intimately
&s;o exalted a character, my &s;entiments of human
nature were rai&s;ed, while, by a &s;ort of contagion, I
felt an hone&s;t ardour to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, and be
u&s;eful, as far as my &s;ituation and abilities would
allow; and I was, for the re&s;t of my life, &s;et free
from a &s;lavi&s;h timidity in the pre&s;ence of great
men, for where &s;hall I find a man greater than
Paoli?</P>
<P>When I &s;et out from Sollacar&ograve;, I felt my&s;elf a
good deal indi&s;po&s;ed. The old hou&s;e of Colonna,
like the family of its ma&s;ter, was much decayed;
&s;o that both wind and rain found their way into
my bed chamber. From this I contracted a &s;e|vere
<PB N="373" REF="368">
cold, which ended in a tertian ague. There
was no help for it. I might well &s;ubmit to &s;ome
inconveniences, where I had enjoyed &s;o much
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I was accompanied a part of the road by a
great &s;warthy prie&s;t, who had never been out of
Cor&s;ica. He was a very Hercules for &s;trength
and re&s;olution. He and two other Cor&s;icans
took a ca&s;tle, garri&s;oned by no le&s;s than fifteen
Genoe&s;e. Indeed the Cor&s;icans have &s;uch a con|tempt
for their enemies, that I have heard them
&s;ay, &startq;Ba&s;terebbero le donne contra i Genove&s;i,
Our women would be enough again&s;t the Geno|e&s;e.&endq;
This prie&s;t was a bluff, hearty, roaring fel|low,
troubled neither with knowledge nor care. He
was ever and anon &s;hewing me how &s;toutly his nag
could caper. He always rode &s;ome paces before
me, and &s;at in an attitude half turned round,
with his hand clapped upon the crupper. Then
he would bur&s;t out with comical &s;ongs about the
devil and the Genoe&s;e, and I don't know what all.
In &s;hort, notwith&s;tanding my feveri&s;hne&s;s, he
kept me laughing whether I would or no.</P>
<P>I was returning to Corte; but I varied my
road a little from the way I had come, going
more upon the low country, and nearer the
we&s;tern &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="369">
At Cauro I had a fine view of Ajaccio and its
environs. My ague was &s;ome time of forming,
&s;o I had frequent intervals of ea&s;e, which I em|ployed
in ob&s;erving whatever occurred. I was
lodged at Cauro in the hou&s;e of Signor Peraldi of
Ajaccio, who received me with great politene&s;s.
I found here another provincial magi&s;tracy. Be|fore
&s;upper, Signor Peraldi and a young Abb&eacute; of
Ajaccio entertained me with &s;ome airs on the vio|lin.
After they had &s;hewn me their ta&s;te in fine
improved mu&s;ick, they gave me &s;ome original
Cor&s;ican airs, and at my de&s;ire, they brought
up four of the guards of the magi&s;tracy, and
made them &s;hew me a Cor&s;ican dance. It was
truly &s;avage. They thumped with their heels,
&s;prung upon their toes, brandi&s;hed their arms,
wheeled and leaped with the mo&s;t violent ge&s;ticu|lations.
It gave me the idea of an admirable
war dance.</P>
<P>During this journey I had very bad weather.
I cannot forget the worthy rectour of Cuttoli,
who&s;e hou&s;e afforded me a ho&s;pitable retreat,
when wet to the &s;kin, and quite overcome by
the &s;everity of the &s;torm, which my &s;ickne&s;s
made me little able to re&s;i&s;t. He was directly
&s;uch a venerable hermit as we read of in the old
romances. His figure and manner intere&s;ted me
at fir&s;t &s;ight. I found he was a man well re|&s;pected
<PB N="375" REF="370">
in the i&s;land, and that the General did
him the honour to corre&s;pond with him. He
gave me a &s;imple collation of eggs, che&s;tnuts
and wine, and was very liberal of his ham and
other more &s;ub&s;tantial victuals to my &s;ervant.
The hone&s;t Swi&s;s was by this time very well
plea&s;ed to have his face turned towards the con|tinent.
He was heartily tired of &s;eeing foreign
parts, and meeting with &s;canty meals and hard
beds, in an i&s;land which he could not compre|hend
the plea&s;ure of vi&s;iting. He &s;aid to me,
&startq;Si J'etois encore une fois retourn&eacute; &agrave; mon pais
parmi ces montagnes de &s;ui&s;&s;e dont mon&s;ieur fait
tant des plai&s;anteries, Je verrai qui m'engagera &agrave;
les quitter. If I were once more at home in my
own country, among tho&s;e mountains of Swit|zerland,
on which you have had &s;o many jokes,
I will &s;ee who &s;hall prevail with me to quit them.&endq;</P>
<P>The General out of his great politene&s;s, would
not allow me to travel without a couple of cho|&s;en
guards to attend me in ca&s;e of any accidents.
I made them my companions, to relieve the te|diou&s;ne&s;s
of my journey. One of them called
Ambro&s;io, was a &s;trange iron-couloured fearle&s;s
creature. He had been much in war; carele&s;s of
wounds, he was coolly intent on de&s;troying
the enemy. He told me, as a good anecdote, that
having been &s;o lucky as to get a view of two
<PB N="376" REF="371">
Genoe&s;e exactly in a line, he took his aim, and
&s;hot them both through the head at once. He
talked of this, ju&s;t as one would talk of &s;hooting
a couple of crows. I was &s;ure I needed be under
no apprehen&s;ion; but I don't know how, I de|&s;ired
Ambro&s;io to march before me, that I might
&s;ee him.</P>
<P>I was upon my guard how I treated him.
But as &s;ickne&s;s frets one's temper, I &s;ometimes
forgot my&s;elf, and called him &startq;be&s;tia, block|head;&endq;
and once when he was at a lo&s;s which way
to go, at a wild woody part of the country, I fell
into a pa&s;&s;ion, and called to him &startq;Mi maraviglio
che un uomo &s;i bravo pu&ograve; e&s;&s;er &s;i &s;tupido, I am
amazed that &s;o brave a man can be &s;o &s;tupid.&endq;
However by afterwards calling him friend, and
&s;peaking &s;oftly to him, I &s;oon made him forget
my ill humour, and we proceeded as before.</P>
<P>Paoli had al&s;o been &s;o good as to make me a
pre&s;ent of one of his dogs, a &s;trong and fierce
animal. But he was too old to take an attach|ment
to me, and I lo&s;t him between Lyons and
Paris. The General has promi&s;ed me a young
one, to be a guard at Auchinleck.</P>
<P>At Bogognano I came upon the &s;ame road
I had formerly travelled from Corte, where I ar|rived
&s;afe after all my fatigues. My good fa|thers
<PB N="377" REF="372">
of the Franci&s;can convent, received me like
an old acquaintance, and &s;hewed a kind concern
at my illne&s;s. I &s;ent my re&s;pects to the Great
Chancellor, who returned me a note, of which I
in&s;ert a tran&s;lation as a &s;pecimen of the hearty ci|vility
to be found among the highe&s;t in Cor&s;ica.</P>
<P>&startq;Many congratulations to Mr. Bo&s;well on his
return from beyond the mountains, from his
&s;ervant Ma&s;&s;e&s;i, who is at the &s;ame time very &s;or|ry
for his indi&s;po&s;ition, which he is per&s;uaded has
been occa&s;ioned by his &s;evere journey. He how|ever
flatters him&s;elf, that when Mr. Bo&s;well has
repo&s;ed him&s;elf a little, he will recover his u&s;ual
health. In the mean time he has taken the li|berty
to &s;end him a couple of fowls, which he
hopes, he will honour with his acceptance, as he
will need &s;ome refre&s;hment this evening. He
wi&s;hes him a good night, as does his little &s;ervant
Luiggi, who will attend him to-morrow, to di&s;|charge
his duty.&endq;</P>
<P>My ague di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me &s;o much, that I was
confined to the convent for &s;everal days. I did not,
however, find my&s;elf weary. I was vi&s;ited by the
Great Chancellor, and &s;everal others of the civil
magi&s;trates, and by Padre Mariani rectour of the
univer&s;ity, a man of learning and abilities, as a
proof of which he had been three years at Madrid
<PB N="378" REF="373">
in the character of &s;ecretary to the General of the
Franci&s;cans. I remember a very eloquent ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of his, on the &s;tate of his country. &startq;Cor|&s;ica,
&s;aid he, has for many years pa&s;t, been bleed|ing
at all her veins. They are now clo&s;ed. But
after being &s;o &s;everely exhau&s;ted, it will take &s;ome
time before &s;he can recover perfect &s;trength.&endq; I
was al&s;o vi&s;ited by Padre Leonardo, of who&s;e ani|mating
di&s;cour&s;e I have made mention in a for|mer
part of this book.</P>
<P>Indeed I &s;hould not have been at a lo&s;s though
my very reverend fathers had been all my &s;ociety.
I was not in the lea&s;t looked upon as a heretick.
Difference of faith was forgotten in ho&s;pitality.
I went about the convent as if I had been in my
own hou&s;e; and the fathers without any impro|priety
of mirth, were yet as cheerful as I could
de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I had two &s;urgeons to attend me at Corte, a
Cor&s;ican and a Piedmonte&s;e; and I got a little
Je&s;uit's bark from the &s;piceria or apothecary's
&s;hop, of the Capuchin covent. I did not how|ever
expect to be effectually cured, till I &s;hould
get to Ba&s;tia. I found it was perfectly &s;afe for
me to go thither. There was a kind of truce be|tween
the Cor&s;icans and the French. Paoli had
held two different amicable conferences with M.
de Marboeuf their commander in chief, and was
<PB N="379" REF="374">
&s;o well with him, that he gave me a letter of re|commendation
to him.</P>
<P>On one of the days that my ague di&s;turbed
me lea&s;t, I walked from the convent to Corte,
purpo&s;ely to write a letter to Mr. Samuel John|&s;on.
I told my revered friend, that from a kind
of &s;uper&s;tition agreeable in a certain degree to
him, as well as to my&s;elf, I had, during my tra|vels,
written to him from LOCA SOLENNIA, places
in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;acred. That as I had written
to him from the Tomb of Melancthon, &s;acred to
learning and piety, I new wrote to him from
the palace of Pa&s;cal Paoli, &s;acred to wi&s;dom and
liberty; knowing that however his political prin|ciples
may have been repre&s;ented, he had always
a generous zeal for the common rights of hu|manity.
I gave him a &s;ketch of the great things
I had &s;een in Cor&s;ica, and promi&s;ed him a more
ample relation.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on was plea&s;ed with what I wrote
here; for I received at Paris an an&s;wer from him
which I keep as valuable charter. &startq;When you
return, you will return to an unaltered, and I
hope, unalterable friend. All that you have to
fear from me, is the vexation of di&s;appointing
me. No man loves to fru&s;trate expectations
which have been formed in his favour, and the
<PB N="380" REF="375">
plea&s;ure which I promi&s;e my&s;elf from your jour|nals
and remarks, is &s;o great, that perhaps no
degree of attention or di&s;cernment will be &s;uf|ficient
to afford it. Come home however and
take your chance. I long to &s;ee you, and to
hear you; and hope that we &s;hall not be &s;o long
&s;eparated again. Come home, and expect &s;uch
a welcome as is due to him whom a wi&s;e and
noble curio&s;ity has led where perhaps, no native
of this country ever was before.&endq;</P>
<P>I at length &s;et our for Ba&s;tia. I went the fir&s;t
night to Ro&s;tino, hoping to have found there
Signor Clemente de' Paoli. But unluckily he had
gone upon a vi&s;it to his daughter; &s;o that I had
not an opportunity of &s;eeing this extraordinary
per&s;onage, of whom I have given &s;o full an ac|count,
for a great part of which I am indebted
to Mr. Burnaby.</P>
<P>Next day I reached Ve&s;covato, where I was
received by Signor Buttafoco, colonel of the Royal
Cor&s;icans in the &s;ervice of France, with whom I
pa&s;t &s;ome days.</P>
<P>As various di&s;cour&s;es have been held in Eu|rope,
concerning an invitation given to M. Rou&s;|&s;eau
to come to Cor&s;ica; and as that affair was
conducted by Signor Buttafoco, who &s;hewed me
the whole corre&s;pondence between him and M.
<PB N="381" REF="376">
Rou&s;&s;eau, I am enabled to give a di&s;tinct account
of it.</P>
<P>M. Rou&s;&s;eau in his Political Treati&s;e, entitled
DU CONTRACT SOCIAL, has the following ob&s;er|vation:
&startq;Il e&s;t encore en Europe un pays ca|pable
de l&eacute;gi&s;lation; c'e&s;t l'i&s;le de Cor&s;e. La va|leur
et la con&s;tance avec laquelle ce brave peuple
a &s;u recouvrer et d&eacute;fendre &s;a libert&eacute; m&eacute;riteroit
bien que quelque homme &s;age lui apprit &agrave; la
con&s;erver. J'ai quelque pre&s;&s;entiment qu'un jour
cette petite i&s;le etonnera l'Europe<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Du Contract Social. liv. ii. chap. 10.</NOTE>. There is
yet one country in Europe, capable of legi&s;lation;
and that is the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica. The valour
and the con&s;tancy with which that brave people
hath recovered and defended its liberty, would
well de&s;erve that &s;ome wi&s;e man &s;hould teach
them how to pre&s;erve it. I have &s;ome pre&s;enti|ment
that one day that little i&s;land will a&s;toni&s;h
Europe.&endq;</P>
<P>Signor Buttafoco, upon this, wrote to M.
Rou&s;&s;eau, returning him thanks for the honour
he had done to the Cor&s;ican nation, and &s;trongly
inviting him to come over, and be that wi&s;e man
who &s;hould illuminate their minds.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="377">
I was allowed to take a copy of the wild phi|lo&s;opher's
an&s;wer to this invitation; it is written
with his u&s;ual eloquence.</P>
<P>&startq;Il e&s;t &s;uperflu, Mon&s;ieur, de chercher &agrave; exci|ter
mon zele pour l'entrepri&s;e que vous me pro|po&s;ez.
Sa &s;eule id&eacute;e m'eleve l'ame et me tran&s;|porte.
Je croirois la re&s;te de mes jours bien

<P>&startq;It is &s;uperfluous, Sir, to endeavour to excite
my zeal for the undertaking which you propo&s;e
to me. The very idea of it elevates my &s;oul
and tran&s;ports me. I &s;hould e&s;teem the re&s;t of
my days very nobly, very virtuou&s;ly, and very
happily employed. I &s;hould even think that I
well redeemed the inutility of many of my days
that are pa&s;t, if I could render the&s;e &s;ad re|mains
of any advantage to your brave country|men.
If by any u&s;eful advice, I could con|cur
in the views of your worthy Chief, and in&endq;
<PB N="383" REF="378">
&startq;yours. So far then you may be &s;ure of me. My
life and my heart are devoted to you.&endq;</P>
<P>Such were the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of Rou&s;&s;eau. Yet
before he concluded even this fir&s;t letter, he made
a great many complaints of his adver&s;ities and
per&s;ecutions, and &s;tarted a variety of difficulties
as to the propo&s;ed enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The corre&s;pondence was kept up for &s;ome
time, but the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the paradoxical phi|lo&s;opher
gradually &s;ub&s;iding, the &s;cheme came to
nothing.</P>
<P>As I have formerly ob&s;erved, M. de Voltaire
thought proper to exerci&s;e his plea&s;antry upon
occa&s;ion of this propo&s;al, in order to vex the
grave Rou&s;&s;eau, whom he never could bear. I
remember he u&s;ed to talk of him with a &s;aty|rical
&s;mile, and call him, &startq;Ce Gar&ccedil;on, That
Lad;&endq; I find this among my notes of M. de Vol|taire's
conver&s;ations, when I was with him at his
Chateau de Ferney, where he entertains with the
elegance rather of a real prince than of a poetical
one.</P>
<P>To have Voltaire's a&s;&s;ertion contradicted by a
letter under Paoli's own hand, was no doubt a
&s;ufficient &s;atisfaction to Rou&s;&s;eau.</P>
<P>From the account which I have attempted to
give of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Cor&s;ica, and of
<PB N="384" REF="379">
its illu&s;trious Legi&s;lator and General, it may well
be conceived that the &s;cheme of bringing M.
Rou&s;&s;eau into that i&s;land, was magnified to an
extravagant degree by the reports of the conti|nent.
It was &s;aid, that Rou&s;&s;eau was to be made
no le&s;s than a Solon by the Cor&s;icans, who
were implicitely to receive from him a code of
laws.</P>
<P>This was by no means the &s;cheme. Paoli was
too able a man to &s;ubmit the legi&s;lation of his
country to one who was an entire &s;tranger to the
people, the manners, and in &s;hort to every thing
in the i&s;land. Nay I know well that Paoli pays
more regard to what has been tried by the expe|rience
of ages, than to the mo&s;t beautiful ideal
&s;y&s;tems. Be&s;ides, the Cor&s;icans were not all at
once to be moulded at will. They were to be
gradually prepared, and by one law laying the
foundation for another, a complete fabrick of
juri&s;prudence was to be formed.</P>
<P>Paoli's intention was to grant a generous a&s;y|lum
to Rou&s;&s;eau, to avail him&s;elf of the &s;hining
talents which appeared in his writings, by con&s;ult|ing
with him, and catching the lights of his rich
imagination, from many of which he might derive
improvements to tho&s;e plans which his own wi&s;|dom
had laid down.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="380">
But what he had principally in view, was to
employ the pen of Rou&s;&s;eau in recording the he|roick
actions of the brave i&s;landers. It is to be
regretted that this project did not take place.
The father of the pre&s;ent colonel Buttafoco
made large collections for many years back.
The&s;e are carefully pre&s;erved, and when joined
to tho&s;e made by the Abb&eacute; Ro&s;tini, would fur|ni&s;h
ample materials for a Hi&s;tory of Cor&s;ica.
This, adorned with the genius of Rou&s;&s;eau,
would have been one of the noble&s;t monuments of
modern times.</P>
<P>Signor Buttafoco accompanied me to Ba&s;tia.
It was comfortable to enter a good warm town
after my fatigues. We went to the hou&s;e of
Signor Morelli, a coun&s;ellor at law here, with
whom we &s;upped. I was lodged for that night
by a friend of Signor Buttafoco, in another part
of the town.</P>
<P>Next morning I waited on M. de Marboeuf.
Signor Buttafoco introduced me to him, and I
pre&s;ented him the letter of recommendation from
Paoli. He gave me a mo&s;t polite reception.
The brilliancy of his levee plea&s;ed me; it was a
&s;cene &s;o different from tho&s;e which I had been
for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to &s;ee. It was like
<PB N="386" REF="381">
pa&s;&s;ing at once from a rude and early age, to a
poli&s;hed modern age; from the mountains of
Cor&s;ica, to the banks of the Seine.</P>
<P>My ague was now becoem &s;o violent, that it
got the better of me altogether. I was obliged
to a&s;k the French general's permi&s;&s;ion to have a
chair &s;et for me in the circle. When M. de
Marboeuf was informed of my being ill, he had
the goodne&s;s to a&s;k me to &s;tay in his hou&s;e till I
&s;hould recover; &startq;I in&s;i&s;t upon it, &s;aid he; I have
a warm room for you. My &s;ervants will get you
bouillons, and every thing proper for a &s;ick
man; and we have an excellent phy&s;ician.&endq; I
mention all the&s;e circum&s;tances to &s;hew the
goodne&s;s of M. de Marboeuf, to whom I &s;hall
ever con&s;ider my&s;elf as under great obligations.
His invitation was given in &s;o kind and cordial
a manner, that I willingly accepted of it.</P>
<P>I found M. de Marboeuf a worthy open|hearted
Frenchman. It is a common and a
very ju&s;t remark, that one of the mo&s;t agree|able
characters in the world is a Frenchman who
has &s;erved long in the army, and has arrived at
that age when the fire of youth is properly temp|pered.
Such a character is gay without levity,
and judicious without &s;everity. Such a charac|ter
was the Count de Marboeuf, of an ancient
<PB N="387" REF="382">
family in Britanny, where there is more plainne&s;s
of character than among the other French. He
had been Gentilhomme de la Chambre to the
worthy King Stani&s;laus.</P>
<P>He took a charge of me as if he had been my
near relation. He furni&s;hed me with books and
every thing he could think of to amu&s;e me.
While the phy&s;ician ordered me to be kept very
quiet, M. de Marboeuf would allow nobody to
go near me, but payed me a friendly vi&s;it alone.
As I grew better, he gradually encrea&s;ed my &s;o|ciety,
bringing with him more and more of his
officers; &s;o that I had at la&s;t the honour of very
large companies in my apartment. The officers
were polite agreeable men: &s;ome of them had
been pri&s;oners in England, during the la&s;t war.
One of them was a Chevalier de St. Louis, of
the name of Douglas, a de&s;cendant of the illu&s;|trious
hou&s;e of Douglas in Scotland, by a branch
&s;ettled near to Lyons. This gentleman often
came and &s;at with me. The idea of our being
in &s;ome &s;ort countrymen, was plea&s;ing to us
both.</P>
<P>I found here an Engli&s;h woman of Penrith in
Cumberland. When the Highlanders marched
through that country in the year 1745, &s;he had
married a &s;oldier of the French picquets in the
<PB N="388" REF="383">
very mid&s;t of all the confu&s;ion and danger, and
when &s;he could hardly under&s;tand one word he
&s;aid. Such freaks will love &s;ometimes take.</P>

<P>M. de la Chapelle was the phy&s;ician who at|tended
me. He had been &s;everal years phy&s;ician
to the army at Minorca, and had now the &s;ame
office in Cor&s;ica I called him the phy&s;ician of
the i&s;les. He was indeed an excellent one. That
gayet&eacute; de coeur which the French enjoy, runs
through all their profe&s;&s;ions. I remember the
phra&s;e of an Engli&s;h common &s;oldier, who told
me, &startq;that at the battle of Fontenoy, his captain
received a &s;hot in the brea&s;t, and fell, &s;aid the &s;ol|dier,
with his &s;pontoon in his hand, as prettily
killed as ever I &s;ee'd a gentleman.&endq; The &s;oldier's
phra&s;e might be u&s;ed in talking of almo&s;t every
thing which the French do. I may &s;ay I was
prettily cured by M. de la Chapelle.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="384">
But I think my&s;elf bound to relate a circum|&s;tance
which &s;hews him and his nation in the gen|teele&s;t
light. Though he attended me with the
greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, yet, when I was going away,
he would not accept of a &s;ingle Louis d'or. &startq;No
Sir, &s;aid he, I am nobly paid by my king. I am
phy&s;ician to his army here. If I can at the &s;ame
time, be of &s;ervice to the people of the country,
or to any gentleman who may come among us,
I am happy. But I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from taking
money.&endq; M. Brion the &s;urgeon major behaved in
the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had gathered a little &s;trength, I
walked about as well as I could; and &s;aw what
was to be &s;een at Ba&s;tia. Signor Morelli was re|markably
obliging. He made me pre&s;ents of
books and antiques, and of every other-curio&s;ity
relating to Cor&s;ica. I never &s;aw a more generous
man. Signor Caraffa, a Cor&s;ican officer in the
&s;ervice of France, with the order of St. Louis,
was al&s;o very obliging. Having made a longer
&s;tay in Cor&s;ica than I intended, my finances were
exhau&s;ted, and he let me have as much money
as I plea&s;ed. M. Barl&eacute;, &s;ecretary to M. de Mar|boeuf,
was al&s;o very obliging. In &s;hort, I know
not how to expre&s;s my thankfulne&s;s to all the
good people whom I &s;aw at Ba&s;tia.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="385">
The French &s;eemed to agree very well with
the Cor&s;icans. Of old, tho&s;e i&s;landers were
much indebted to the interpo&s;ition of France,
in their favour. But &s;ince the days of Sampiero,
there have been many variances between them.
A &s;ingular one happened in the reign of Lewis
XIV. The Pope's Cor&s;ican guards in &s;ome fit
of pa&s;&s;ion in&s;ulted the French amba&s;&s;adour at
Rome. The &s;uperb monarch re&s;olved to revenge
this outrage. But Pope Alexander VII. fore|&s;eeing
the con&s;equences, agreed to the conditions
required by France; which were, that the Cor&s;i|can
guards &s;hould be obliged to depart the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
&s;tate, that the nation &s;hould be declared
incapable ever to &s;erve the holy &s;ee, and, that
oppo&s;ite to their ancient guard-hou&s;e, &s;hould be
erected a pyramid in&s;cribed with their di&s;|grace<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Corps Diplomatique anno 1664.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Le Brun, who&s;e royal genius could magnify
and enrich every circum&s;tance in honour of his
&s;overeign, has given this &s;tory as a medaillion on
one of the compartments of the great gallery
at Ver&s;ailles. France appears with a &s;tately air,
&s;hewing to Rome the de&s;ign of the pyramid; and
Rome, though bearing a &s;hield marked S. P. Q. R.
receives the de&s;ign with mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive humility.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="386">
I wi&s;h that France had never done the Cor&s;i|cans
greater harm than depriving them of the
honour of being the pope's guards. Boi&s;&s;eux
and Maillebois cannot ea&s;ily be forgotten; nor
can the brave i&s;landers be blamed for complain|ing
that a powerful nation &s;hould interpo&s;e to re|tard
their obtaining entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their coun|try,
and of undi&s;turbed freedom.</P>
<P>M. de Marboeuf appeared to conduct him&s;elf
with the greate&s;t prudence and moderation. He
told me that he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve peace in Cor|&s;ica.
He had entered into a convention with
Paoli, mutually to give up &s;uch criminals as
&s;hould fly into each others territories. Formerly
not one criminal in a hundred was puni&s;hed.
There was no communication between the Cor|&s;icans
and the Genoe&s;e; and if a criminal could
but e&s;cape from the one juri&s;diction to the other,
he was &s;afe. This was very ea&s;ily done, &s;o that
crimes from impunity were very frequent. By
this equitable convention, ju&s;tice has been fully
admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed the re&s;idence of the French in
Cor&s;ica, has, upon the whole, been an advantage
to the patriots. There have been markets twice
a week at the frontiers of each garri&s;on-town,
where the Cor&s;ican pea&s;ants have &s;old all &s;orts of
<PB N="392" REF="387">
provi&s;ions, and brought in a good many French
crowns; which have been melted down into Cor|&s;ican
money. A ce&s;&s;ation of arms for a few years
has been a breathing time to the nation, to pre|pare
it&s;elf for one great effort, which will proba|bly
end in the total expul&s;ion of the Genoe&s;e. A
little lei&s;ure has been given for attending to civil
improvements, towards which the example of the
French has in no &s;mall degree contributed. Many
of the &s;oldiers were excellent handi-craft&s;men,
and could in&s;truct the natives in various arts.</P>
<P>M. de Marboeuf entertained him&s;elf by laying
out &s;everal elegant pieces of plea&s;ure ground;
and &s;uch were the humane and amicable di&s;po&s;i|tions
of this re&s;pectable officer, that he was at
pains to ob&s;erve what things were mo&s;t wante$
in Cor&s;ica, and then imported them from France,
in order to &s;hew an example to the inhabitants.
He introduced in particular, the culture of pota|toes,
of which there were none in the i&s;land upon
his arrival. This root will be of con&s;iderable &s;er|vice
to the Cor&s;icans, it will make a whole&s;ome
variety in their food; and as there will thereby,
of con&s;equence, be le&s;s home con&s;umption of
che&s;tnuts, they will be able to export a greater
quantity of them.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="388">
M. de Marboeuf made merry upon the reports
which had been circulated; that I was no le&s;s than
a mini&s;ter from the Briti&s;h court. The Avignon
gazette brought us one day information, that the
Engli&s;h were going to e&s;tabli&s;h Un Bureau de
Commerce in Cor&s;ica. &startq;O Sir, &s;aid he, the &s;e|cret
is out. I &s;ee now the motive of your de&s;ti|nation
to the&s;e parts. It is you who are to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
this Bureau de Commerce.&endq;</P>
<P>Idle as the&s;e rumours were, it is a fact that,
when I was at Genoa, Signor Gherardi, one of
their &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, very &s;eriou&s;ly told me,
&startq;Mon&s;ieur, vous m'avez faitt rembler quoique je
ne vous ai jamais vu. Sir, you have made me
tremble although I never &s;aw you before.&endq; And
when I &s;miled and a&s;&s;ured him that I was ju&s;t a
&s;imple traveller, he &s;hook his head; but &s;aid, he
had very authentick information concerning me.
He then told me with great gravity, &startq;That while
I travelled in Cor&s;ica, I was d re&s;t in &s;carlet and
gold; but when I payed my re&s;pects to the Su|preme
Council at Corte, I appeared in a full &s;uit
of black.&endq; The&s;e important truths I fairly own|ed
to him, and he &s;eemed to exult over me.</P>
<P>I was more and more obliged to M. de Mar|boeuf.
When I was allowed by my phy&s;ician, to
go to his Excellency's table, where we had always
<PB N="394" REF="389">
a large company, and every thing in great mag|nificence,
he was &s;o careful of me, that he would
not &s;uffer me to eat any thing, or ta&s;te a gla&s;s of
wine, more than was pre&s;cribed for me. He u&s;ed
to &s;ay, &startq;I am here both phy&s;ician and commander
in chief; &s;o you mu&s;t &s;ubmit.&endq; He very politely
pre&s;t me to make &s;ome &s;tay with him, &s;aying,
&startq;We have taken care of you when &s;ick, I think
we have a claim to you for a while, when in health.&endq;
His kindne&s;s followed me after I left him. It pro|cured
me an agreeable reception from M. Michel,
the French charg&eacute; d'affaires at Genoa; and was
the occa&s;ion of my being honoured with great
civilities at Paris, by M. l'Abb&eacute; de Marboeuf
Con&s;eiller d'etat, brother of the Count, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
&s;imilar virtues in private life.</P>
<P>I quitted Cor&s;ica with reluctance, when I
thought of the illu&s;trious Paoli. I wrote to him
from Ba&s;tia, informing him of my illne&s;s, which
I &s;aid, was owing to his having made me a man
of &s;o much con&s;equence, that in&s;tead of putting
me into a &s;nug little room, he had lodged me in
the magnificent old palace, where the wind and
rain entered.</P>
<P>His an&s;wer to my fir&s;t letter is written with &s;o
much &s;pirit, that I begged his permi&s;&s;ion to pub|bli&s;h
it; which he granted in the genteele&s;t man|ner,
<PB N="395" REF="390">
&s;aying, &startq;I do not remember the contents of
of the letter; but I have &s;uch a confidence in

<HEAD>TO JAMES BOSWELL, E&s;&abque;

<P>STIMATISSIMO SIGNOR BOSWELL,
RICEVEI la lettera che mi favori da Ba&s;tia, e
mi con&s;olo a&s;&s;ai colla notizia di e&s;&s;er&s;i rime&s;&s;a in
perfetta &s;alute. Buon per lei che cadde in mano
di un valente medico! Quando altra volta il di&s;|gu&s;to
de' pae&s;i colti, ed ameni lo prende&s;&s;e, e lo
porta&s;&s;e in que&s;ta infelice contrada, procurer&ograve; che
&s;ia alloggiata in camere pi&ugrave; calde, e cu&s;todite di
quelle della ca&s;o Colonna in Sollacar&ograve;; m&agrave; ella
ancora dovr&agrave; contentar&s;i di non viaggiare quando
la giornata, e la &s;tagione vogliono che &s;i re&s;ti in
ca&s;a per attendere il tempo buono. Io re&s;to ora
impaziente per la lettera che ha prome&s;&s;o &s;crivermi
da Genova, dove dubito a&s;&s;ai che la delicatezza di
quelle dame non le abbia fatto fare qualche giorno
di quarantena, per i&s;purgar&s;i di ogni anche pi&ugrave;
<PB N="396" REF="391">
leggiero influ&s;&s;o, che po&s;&s;a avere portato &s;eco dell'
aria di que&s;to pae&s;e; e molto pi&ugrave;, &s;e le fo&s;&s;e ve|nuto
il capriccio di far vedere quell' abito di ve|luto
Cor&s;o, e quel berrettone, di cui i Cor&s;i vogli|ono
l'origine dagli elmi antichi, ed i Genove&s;i lo
dicono inventato da quelli, che, rubando alla &s;tra|da,
non vogliano e&s;&s;ere cono&s;ciuti: come &s;e in
tempo del loro governo ave&s;&s;ero mai avuta ap|pren&s;ione
di ca&s;tigo i ladri pubblici? Son &s;icuro
per&ograve;, che ella pre&s;&s;o avr&agrave; il buon partito con quel|le
amabili, e delicate per&s;one, in&s;inuando alle me|de&s;ime,
che il cuore delle belle &egrave; fatto per la com|pa&s;&s;ione,
non per il di&s;prezzo, e per la tirannia;
e co&s;i &s;ar&agrave; rientrato facilmente nella lor grazia. Io
ritornato in Corte ebbi &s;ubito la notizia del &s;ecre|to&punc;
&s;barco dell' Abbatucci nelle &s;piaggie di Solen|zara.
Tutte le apparenze fanno credere che il
mede&s;imo &s;ia venuto con di&s;egni oppo&s;ti alla pub|blica
quiete; pure &s;i &egrave; con&s;tituito in ca&s;tello, e
prote&s;ta ravvedimento. Nel venire per Bocog|nano

dove &egrave; &s;tato ucci&s;o dalle &s;quadriglie che gli
tenevano dietro i magi&s;trati delle provincie oltra|montane.
Que&s;te in&s;idie non &s;embrano buoni pre|liminari
del no&s;tro accomodamento colla repub|blica

<HEAD>MUCH ESTEEMED MR. BOSWELL,</HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED the letter which you wrote to me
from Ba&s;tia, and am much comforted by hearing
that you are re&s;tored to perfect health. It is lucky
for you that you fell into the hands of an able
phy&s;ician. When you &s;hall again be &s;eized with
a di&s;gu&s;t at improved and agreeable countries,
and &s;hall return to this ill-fated land, I will take
care to have you lodged in warmer and better
fini&s;hed apartments than tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of
Colonna, at Sollacar&ograve;. But you again &s;hould be
&s;atisfied not to travel when the weather and the
&s;ea&s;on require one to keep within doors, and
<PB N="398" REF="393">
wait for a fair day. I expect with impatience the
letter which you promi&s;ed to write to me from
Genoa, where I much &s;u&s;pect that the delicacy of
the ladies will have obliged you to perform &s;ome
days of quarantine, for purifying you from every
the lea&s;t infection, which you may have carried
with you from the air of this country: and &s;till
more &s;o, if you have taken the whim to &s;hew
that &s;uit of Cor&s;ican velvet<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By Cor&s;ican velvet he means the coar&s;e &s;tuff made in the i&s;land, which is all that the Cor&s;icans have in &s;tead of the fine velvet of Genoa.</NOTE> and that bonnet of
which the Cor&s;icans will have the origin to be
from the ancient helmets, whereas the Genoe&s;e
&s;ay it was invented by tho&s;e who rob on the
highway, in order to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves; as if
during the Genoe&s;e government, public robbers
needed to fear puni&s;hment. I am &s;ure however,
that you will have taken the proper method with
the&s;e amiable and delicate per&s;ons, in&s;inuating to
them, that the hearts of beauties are formed for
compa&s;&s;ion, and not for di&s;dain and tyranny:
and &s;o you will have been ea&s;ily re&s;tored to their
good graces. Immediately on my return to
Corte, I received information of the &s;ecret land|ing
of Abbatucci<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Abbatucci, a Cor&s;ican of a very &s;u&s;picious character.</NOTE>, on the coa&s;t of Solenzara.
All appearances make us believe, that he is come
<PB N="399" REF="394">
with de&s;igns contrary to the public quiet. He
has however &s;urrendered him&s;elf a pri&s;oner at the
ca&s;tle, and prote&s;ts his repentance. As I pa&s;&s;ed
by Bogognano, I learnt that a di&s;banded Genoe&s;e
officer was &s;eeking a&s;&s;ociates to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me.
He could not &s;uccced, and finding that he was
di&s;covered, he betook him&s;elf to the woods;
where he has been &s;lain by the party detached
by the magi&s;trates of the provinces on the other
&s;ide of the mountains, in order to intercept him.
The&s;e ambu&s;cades do not &s;eem to be good preli|minaries
towards our accommodation with the re|publick
of Genoa. I am now holding the &s;yndi|cato
in this province of Nebbio. About the 10th
of next month, I &s;hall go, for the &s;ame object,
into the province of Capo Cor&s;o, and during the
month of February, I &s;hall probably fix my re&s;i|dence
in Balagna. I &s;hall return to Corte in the
&s;pring, to prepare my&s;elf for the opening of the
General Con&s;ulta. Wherever I am, your friend|&s;hip
will be pre&s;ent to my mind, and I &s;hall be
de&s;irous to continue a corre&s;pondence with you.
Meanwhile believe me to be</P>

<P>Can any thing be more conde&s;cending, and at
the &s;ame time &s;hew more the firmne&s;s of an hero|ick
mind, than this letter? With what a gallant
plea&s;antry does the Cor&s;ican Chief talk of his ene|mies!
One would think that the Queens of Ge|noa
&s;hould become rival Queens for Paoli. If
they &s;aw him, I am &s;ure they would.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to repeat an ob&s;ervation made
to me by that illu&s;trious mini&s;ter, whom Paoli
calls the Pericles of Great Britain: &startq;It may be
&s;aid of Paoli,&endq; as the Cardinal de Retz &s;aid of the
great Montro&s;e, &startq;C'e&s;t un de ces hommes qu'on
ne trouve plus que dans les Vies de Plutarque.
He is one of tho&s;e men who are no longer to be
found but in the lives of Plutarch.&endq;</P>
