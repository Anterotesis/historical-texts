<P>MR. <HI>Leatherhead</HI>, this is a &s;trange Commotion has happen'd of late in your little Community; that <HI>Poppets</HI>; (who have been hitherto a peaceable Generation,) &s;hould all of a &s;udden, fall a tilting their brainle&s;s Heads at each other, to the utter De&s;truction of all brotherly Affection, is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s very amazing.

<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Neighbour, the wi&s;e&s;t among us are Strangers to what an after-Day may produce. I my&s;elf as little apprehended this Rupture, as any Body; but the Truth is, being oblig'd &s;ome time ago to make a Reform in my little Commonwealth, there being few of the old Members, who had not by frequent Scuffles, lo&s;t &s;ome a No&s;e, others a Leg, and others an Arm, I &s;ent over to <HI>Ire|land</HI>, for &s;ome of the be&s;t Wood that Coun|try affords, in order to repair the Generations among which Stuff, there happen'd to be one damn'd knotty Log, from the County of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The County where <HI>Firebrand</HI> was born.</NOTE> <HI>Clare</HI>, who no &s;ooner receiv'd human Form from the Arti&s;t's Chi&s;&s;el, than he began to di&s;cover &s;ome of that perver&s;e cro&s;s-grain'd Di&s;po&s;ition he was made of. For taking the Advantage, from a late Play I exhibited, call'd, <HI>Whittington and his Cat</HI>; or, <HI>the lucky Venture</HI>, He found Means to &s;et the <HI>Commons</HI> (of which Number he was one) again&s;t their good old Friends, the <HI>Lord Mayor and Aldermen</HI>; by &s;lyly in&s;inuating, as if the&s;e latter in their late quarterly Fea&s;ts, had depriv'd them of their u&s;ual Share of Cu&s;tard, which A&s;|&s;ertion the <HI>Commons</HI> greedily &s;wallowing, have conceiv'd an unconquerable hatred to the <HI>Alder|men</HI>, in&s;omuch, that in&s;tead of making u&s;e of loyal Toa&s;ts, as they were us'd to do, at their merry
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Meetings, they do nothing but drink Confu&s;ion to one another. In &s;hort the Breach is made &s;o wide by Means of this <HI>Incendiary</HI>, that if &s;ome Means be not &s;uddenly taken to clo&s;e it, I am a|fraid it will be the utter Di&s;&s;olution of the Society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nei.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is Strange indeed! that from one <HI>Block</HI>, &s;hould grow &s;o much Confu&s;ion. But how happens it, Mr. <HI>Leatherhead</HI>, that your Night's En|tertainment is call'd the <HI>Election?</HI> I can't &s;ee, what Reference the&s;e Broils have to &s;uch a Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall hear. &mdash; You mu&s;t know, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Squabbles, it happen'd, that the <HI>Lord Mayor's High Steward</HI>, or <HI>Keeper of the Key of the Pant$y</HI>, was made away with. For he being di&s;rob'd of his old Cloaths, in order for a fre&s;h Suit, was &s;eiz'd, as he lay in a Corner, by my <HI>Cookmaid</HI>; who mi&s;taking him for a Log of the old Party, took him to boil the Pot. Now, Sir, as the Vacancy occa&s;ion'd by this Accident cannot be fill'd, but by one duly elected to the Office, there have &s;tarted up, four or five <HI>Candi|dates</HI>, in the foremo&s;t of whom &s;tands <HI>Firebrand</HI>, (the Poppet I ju&s;t now mention'd,) and who is &s;o call'd, from his being of a very hot Con&s;tituti|on, and apt to &s;well, at the lea&s;t mention of ar|bitrary Power, and high Feeding. Now the <HI>Al|dermen</HI>, being afraid that if this <HI>Poppet</HI> carries the <HI>Election</HI>, nothing but &s;tarving on their Side will en&s;ue, u&s;e all their Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e him, while
<PB N="8" REF="6">
he, on the other Hand, by cajoling the <HI>Commons</HI>, with large Promi&s;es of what he'll do for them, when he comes to be elected, has drawn them over to his Party. This, Sir, is the pre&s;ent Po&s;|ture of Affairs, the Con&s;equence of which this Night's Entertainment mu&s;t determine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nei.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it mu&s;t needs afford an abundance of Humour, if it be carry'd on, with the u&s;ual Heat attending Elections. &mdash; But pray, what part do you intend to take in the&s;e Commotions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lea.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None, Sir, none. &mdash; I intend to &s;tand Neuter to Night, and leave all their Affairs to their own Management: But &s;ee! the People begin to thicken, and 'tis Time we were begun. &mdash; Call forth <HI>Che&s;hire Tom</HI> there, till he &s;peaks the Prologue. &mdash; Here <HI>Tom! &mdash; Che&s;hire Tom</HI>, hoa! &mdash;</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Prefaces are &s;eldom look'd into, till the Book is read, I have, for the Ea&s;e of the Reader, plac'd mine at the End; which, if he be curious enough to peru&s;e, he will find in it little more than what others u&s;ually contain; <HI>A Defence of the Work</HI>. A nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;olation again&s;t the en&s;uing Malice of &s;ome Cri|ticks, who generally decry a Performance, with as lit|tle Rea&s;on as the Author commends it. 'Tis in Conformity to &s;o prudent a Rule, I here apprize my Readers, (e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as are ignorant of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>) that they will find the polite Elegance of <HI>Terence</HI>, the Wit and Humour of <HI>Plautus</HI>, the &s;harp Raillery of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI>, and many of the unknown Excellencies of <HI>Menander</HI>, in this Piece happily united. I &s;ay nothing of the Moderns, who&s;e Works I di&s;dain to Copy; being of the &s;ame Opinion with many learn'd Criticks of this City, that except <HI>Colley Cibber, Far|quhar</HI>, and two or three choice Plays of Mrs. <HI>Su&s;annah Centlievre</HI>, the re&s;t are not worth Reading. For certain I am, was there the lea&s;t Grain of Merit in any of the others, as &s;ome po&s;itive Fools in&s;i&s;t on; &s;o wi&s;e and learn'd a City as <HI>Dublin</HI>, wou'd certainly e'er this have found it out. And here I cannot forbear, in the great Joy of my Heart, from congratulating my Countrymen upon the immen&s;e Trea&s;ure of Learning, and Genius they po&s;&s;e&s;s in the Per&s;on of the great Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, a Man who not only a&s;&s;i&s;ts our Ta&s;te in acting &s;uch Plays as are conformable thereto, but brings all others of what Texture &s;oever to the &s;ame Level. A <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> in his Hands, &s;eems no more than a <HI>Young</HI> or a <HI>Rowe</HI> wou'd in anothers. He &s;tudies our Capacities, and corrects each &s;ublime and knotty Pa&s;&s;age to &s;uch an intelligible Lowne&s;s, as I am &s;ure the meane&s;t Auditor cannot but be &s;atisfy'd therewith. 'Tis in order to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to &s;o great a Reformer, I have by me a perfect Plan, or &s;et of new Rules, drawn from his own Practice, for adju&s;t|ing the Oeconomy of Dre&s;s, the Intervention of Songs,

and Dances between the Acts, Roratorio's, <HI>Hibernian</HI> Triumphs, and Concerts of Mu&s;ick, with all the Play-Hou&s;e Tackle, &s;uch as Thunder, Lightning, Hail, Rain, Snow, Sea Scenes, Ri&s;ing Suns, and Magick Lan|thorns. In &s;hort every Thing that ought not to belong to a Play-Hou&s;e, I have mo&s;t carefully collected: and till &s;uch Time as a proper Sea&s;on comes for publi&s;hing them, it is reque&s;ted that young Gentlemen will conti|nue to re&s;ort <HI>Smock-Alley</HI> Play-Hou&s;e, as the only School in which they may have their Knowledge of the&s;e Matters encrea&s;ed, and a Foundation laid for that &s;ub|lime Way of Thinking, which no Documents, or Rules to the contrary, will ever be able to eradicate.</P>
<P>But to return to the Prai&s;e of my Book,&mdash;I am not &s;o arrogant to &s;ay, 'tis the be&s;t Piece of Ridicule ever was written, but if my Reader of his own Ac|cord is willing to think as much, truly I will not quar|rel with him for the Matter,&mdash;for the Sake of Peace much Ob&s;tinacy mu&s;t be born with, &mdash;as odd Things have been a&s;&s;erted before now, and if it be nece&s;&s;ary that Criticks &s;hould mi&s;take &s;ometimes, they may as well mi&s;take in my Behalf, as in any other Author's, I &s;hall not be the fir&s;t who has got an unde&s;erved Reputation; and indeed of late Years, the publick &s;eem to have got a <HI>Knack</HI> of prai&s;ing the wor&s;t Things mo&s;t, As they &s;ay indulgent Parents treat with the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s their weak Children, but re&s;ign to Fortune, or their own In|du&s;try, tho&s;e of a more vigorous Con&s;titution.</P>
