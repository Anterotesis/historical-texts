<HEAD>A CHAIN of
PHILOSOSPHICAL REFLEXIONS
AND
INQUIRIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FOR INTRODUCTION to the following
piece I a&s;&s;ure the reader, that nothing
could, in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, have in|duced
me to be at the pains of writing
it, but a firm belief that it would prove a valua|ble
pre&s;ent to the Public. What entertainment &s;o|ever
the rea&s;oning or notional part may afford the
mind, I will venture to &s;ay, the other part &s;eemeth
so &s;urely calculated to do good to the body, that
both mu&s;t be gainers. For if the lute be not well
tuned, the mu&s;ician fails of his harmony. And in
our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the operations of the mind, &s;o
far depend on the right tone or good condition of
it's in&s;trument, that any thing which greatly con|tributes
to pre&s;erve or recover the health of the
body, is well worth the attention of the mind.
The&s;e con&s;iderations have moved me to communi|cate
to the Public the &s;alutary virtues of Tar wa|ter;
to which I thought my&s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably
obliged, by the duty every man owes to mankind.
And, as effects are linked with their cau&s;es, my
thoughts on this low but u&s;eful theme led to far|ther
<PB N="4" REF="3">
inquiries, and tho&s;e on to others remote, per|haps,
and &s;peculative, but, I hope, not altogether
u&s;ele&s;s or unentertaining.</P>
<P>1. IN certain parts of America, Tar water is
made by putting a quart of cold water to a
quart of tar, and &s;tirring them well together in a
ve&s;&s;el, which is left &s;tanding till the tar &s;inks to
the bottom. A gla&s;s of clear water being poured
off for a draught is replaced by the &s;ame quantity
of fre&s;h water, the ve&s;&s;el being &s;haken and left to
&s;tand as before. And this is repeated for every
gla&s;s; &s;o long as the tar continues to impregnate
the water &s;ufficiently, which will appear by the
&s;mell and ta&s;te. But as this method produceth tar
water of different degrees of &s;trength, I chu&s;e to
make it in the following manner: Pour a gallon
of cold water on a quart of tar, and &s;tir and mix
them thoroughly with a ladle or flat &s;tick for the
&s;pace of three or four minutes, after which the ve&s;|&s;el
mu&s;t &s;tand eight and forty hours that the tar
may have time to &s;ub&s;ide, when the clear water is
to be poured off and kept for u&s;e, no more being
made from the &s;ame tar, which may &s;till &s;erve for
common purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>2. This cold infu&s;ion of tar hath been u&s;ed in
&s;ome of our colonies, as a pre&s;ervative or prepara|tive
again&s;t the &s;mall-pox, which foreign practice
induced me to try it in my own neighbourhood,
when the &s;mall pox raged with great violence. And
the trial fully an&s;wered my expectation: all tho&s;e,
within my knowledge, who took the tar water
having either e&s;caped that di&s;temper, or had it
very favourably. In one family there was a re|markable
in&s;tance of &s;even children, who came all
very well through the &s;mall-pox, except one young
<PB N="5" REF="4">
child which could not be brought to drink tar-wa|ter
as the re&s;t had done.</P>
<P>3. Several were pre&s;erved from taking the &s;mall-pox
by the u&s;e of this liquor: others had it in the
milde&s;t manner, and others that they might be able
to take the infection were obliged to intermit
drinking the tar-water. I have found it may be
drunk with great &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s for any length
of time, and this not only before, but al&s;o during
the di&s;temper. The general rule for taking it is,
about half a pint night and morning on an empty
&s;tomach, which quantity may be varied, according
to the ca&s;e and age of the patient, provided it be
always taken on an empty &s;tomach, and about two
hours before or after a meal.</P>
<P>4. It &s;eemed probable, that a medicine of &s;uch
efficacy in a di&s;temper attended with &s;o many pu|rulent
ulcers, might be al&s;o u&s;eful in other foul|ne&s;&s;es
of the blood, accordingly I tried it on &s;eve|ral
per&s;ons infected with cutaneous eruptions and
ulcers, who were &s;oon relieved, and &s;oon after cu|red.
Encouraged by the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es I ventured to
advi&s;e it in the foule&s;t di&s;tempers, wherein it pro|ved
much more &s;ucce&s;sful than &s;alivations and wood-drinks
had done.</P>
<P>5. Having tried it in a great variety of ca&s;es, I
found it &s;ucceed beyond my hopes; in a tedious
and painful ulceration of the bowels, in a con&s;ump|tive
cough and (as appeared by expectorated pus) an
ulcer in the lungs; in a pleuri&s;y and perpineumony.
And when a per&s;on, who for &s;ome years had been
&s;ubject to ery&s;ipelatous fevers, perceived the u&s;ual
fore-running &s;ymptoms to come on, I advi&s;ed her
to drink tar-water which prevented the ery&s;ipelas.</P>
<P>6. I never knew any thing &s;o good for the &s;to|mach
as tar-water: it cures indige&s;tion and gives
a good appetite. It is an excellent medicine in an
<PB N="6" REF="5">
a&s;thma. It imparts a kindly warmth and quick
circulation to the juices without heating, and is
therefore u&s;eful, not only as a pectoral and bal&s;a|mic,
but al&s;o as a powerful and &s;afe deob&s;truent in
cachectic and hy&s;teric ca&s;es. As it is both healing
and diuretic, it is very good for the gravel. I
believe it to be of great u&s;e in a drop&s;y, having
known it cure a very bad ana&s;acra in a per&s;on
who&s;e thir&s;t, though very extraordinary, was in
a &s;hort time removed by the drinking of tar-water.</P>
<P>7. The u&s;efulne&s;s of this medicine in inflamma|tory
ca&s;es is evident, from what has been already
ob&s;erved<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 5.</NOTE> And yet &s;ome perhaps may &s;u&s;pect
that, as the tar it &s;elf is &s;ulphureous, tar-water
mu&s;t be of a hot and inflaming nature. But it is
to be noted that all bal&s;ams contain an acid &s;pirit,
which is in truth a volatile &s;alt. Water is a men|&s;truum
that di&s;&s;olves all &s;orts of &s;alts, and draws
them from their &s;ubjects. Tar, therefore, being
a bal&s;am, its &s;alutary acid is extracted by water,
which yet is incapable of di&s;&s;olving it's gro&s;s re|&s;inous
parts, who&s;e proper men&s;truum is &s;pirit of
wine. Therefore tar-water, not being impregna|ted
with re&s;in, may be &s;afely u&s;ed in inflammatory
ca&s;es: and in fact it hath been found an admirable
febrifuge, at once the &s;afe&s;t cooler and cordial.</P>
<P>8. The volatile &s;alts &s;eparated by infu&s;ion from
tar, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain its &s;pecific vir|tues.
Mr. Boyle and other later Chemi&s;ts are a|greed,
that fixed &s;alts are much the &s;ame in all bo|dies.
But it is well known that volatile &s;alts do
greatly differ, and the ea&s;ier they are &s;eparated
from the &s;ubject, the more do they po&s;&s;e&s;s of its
&s;pecific qualities. Now the mo&s;t ea&s;y &s;eparation
is by infu&s;ion of tar in cold water, which to &s;mell
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and ta&s;te &s;hewing it &s;elf well impregnated, may
be pre&s;umed to extract and retain the mo&s;t pure
volatile and active particles of that vegetable
bal&s;am.</P>
<P>9. Tar was by the ancients e&s;teemed good
again&s;t poi&s;ons, ulcers, the bites of venomous
creatures, al&s;o for pthi&s;ical, &s;crophulous, paralitic
and a&s;thmatic per&s;ons. But the method of ren|dering
it an inoffen&s;ive medicine and agreeable to
the &s;tomach, by extracting it's virtues in cold wa|ter,
was unknown to them. The leaves and ten|der
tops of pine and fir are in our times u&s;ed for
diet-drinks, and allowed to be anti&s;corbutic and
diuretic. But the mo&s;t elaborate juice, &s;alt, and
&s;pirit of tho&s;e evergreens are to be found in tar;
who&s;e virtues extend not to animals alone, but al&s;o
to vegetables. Mr. Evelyn in his treati&s;e on fore&s;t
trees ob&s;erves with wonder, that &s;tems of trees,
&s;meared over with tar, are pre&s;erved thereby from
being hurt by the invenomed teeth of goats and
other injuries, while every other thing of an un|ctuous
nature is highly prejudicial to them.</P>
<P>10. It &s;eems that tar and turpentine may be had
more or le&s;s, from all &s;orts of pines and firs what|&s;oever;
and that the native &s;pirits and e&s;&s;ential
&s;alts of tho&s;e vegetables are the &s;ame in turpentine
and common tar. In effect this vulgar tar, which
cheapne&s;s and plenty may have rendered contemp|tible,
appears to be an excellent bal&s;am, contain|ing
the virtues of mo&s;t other bal&s;ams, which it
ea&s;ily imparts to water, and by that means readily
and inoffen&s;ively in&s;inuates them into the habit of
the body.</P>
<P>11. The re&s;inous ex&s;udations of pines and firs
are an important branch of the materia medica,
and not only u&s;eful in the pre&s;criptions of phy&s;i|cians,
but have been al&s;o thought otherwi&s;e con|ducive
<PB N="8" REF="7">
to health. Pliny tells us, that wines in the
time of the old Romans were medicated with pitch
and re&s;in; and Jon&s;tonus in his Dendrographia
ob&s;erves, that it is whole&s;ome to walk in groves of
pine trees, which impregnate the air with bal&s;amic
particles. That all turpentines and re&s;ins are good
for the lungs, again&s;t gravel al&s;o and ob&s;tructions,
is no &s;ecret. And that the medicinal properties of
tho&s;e drugs are found in tar water, without heat|ing
the blood, or di&s;ordering the &s;tomach, is con|firmed
by experience: and particularly that pthi&s;i|cal
and a&s;thmatic per&s;ons receive &s;peedy and great
relief from the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>12. Bal&s;ams, as all unctuous and oily medicines,
create a nau&s;eating in the &s;tomach. They cannot
therefore be taken in &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o much or &s;o
long, as to produce all tho&s;e &s;alutary effects, which,
if thoroughly mixed with the blood and juices,
they would be capable of producing. It mu&s;t
therefore be a thing of great benefit, to be able to
introduce any requi&s;ite quantity of their volatile
parts into the fine&s;t ducts and capillaries, &s;o as not
to offend the &s;tomach, but, on the contrary, to
comfort and &s;trengthen it in a great degree.</P>
<P>13. According to Pliny, liquid pitch (as he
calls it) or tar was obtained by &s;etting fire to bil|lets
of old fat pines or firs. The fir&s;t running was
tar, the latter or thicker running was pitch. Theo|phra&s;tus
is more particular: he tells us the Mace|donians
made huge heaps of the cloven trunks of
tho&s;e trees, wherein the billets were placed erect
be&s;ide each other. That &s;uch heaps or piles of
wood were &s;ometimes a hundred and eighty cubits
round, and &s;ixty or even a hundred high: and
that having covered them with &s;ods of earth to
prevent the flame from bur&s;ting forth (in which
ca&s;e the tar was lo&s;t) they &s;et on fire tho&s;e huge
<PB N="9" REF="8">
heaps of pine or fir, letting the tar and pitch run
out in a channel.</P>
<P>14. Pliny &s;aith, it was cu&s;tomary for the anci|ents,
to hold fleeces of wool over the &s;team of
boiling tar, and &s;queeze the moi&s;ture from them,
which watery &s;ub&s;tance was called pi&s;&s;inum. Ray
will have this to be the &s;ame with the pi&s;&s;elaeum
of the ancients; but Hardouin in his notes on Pli|ny,
thinks the pi&s;&s;elaeum to have been produced
from the cones of cedars. What u&s;e they made
of the&s;e liquors anciently I know not: but it may
be pre&s;umed they were u&s;ed in medicine, though
at pre&s;ent, for ought I can find, they are not u&s;ed
at all.</P>
<P>15. From the manner of procuring tar<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sect. 13.</NOTE> it
plainly appears to be a natural production, lodged
in the ve&s;&s;els of the tree, whence it is only freed
and let lo&s;e (not made) by burning. If we may
believe Pliny, the fir&s;t running or tar was called
cedrium, and was of &s;uch efficacy to pre&s;erve from
putrefaction, that in Egypt they embalmed dead
bodies with it. And to this he a&s;cribes their mum|mies
continuing uncorrupted for &s;o many ages.</P>
<P>16. Some modern writers inform us that tar
flows from the trunks of pines and firs, when
they are very old, through inci&s;ions made in the
bark near the root; that pitch is tar in&s;pi&s;&s;ated;
and both are the oyl of the tree grown thick and
black with age and &s;un. The trees, like old men,
being unable to per&s;pire, and their &s;ecretory ducts
ob&s;tructed, they are, as one may &s;ay, choaked and
&s;tuffed with their own juice.</P>
<P>17. The method u&s;ed by our colonies in Ame|rica,
for making tar and pitch, is in effect the
&s;ame with that of the ancient Macedonians; as
appears from the account given in the Philo&s;ophical
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Tran&s;actions. And the relation of Leo Africanus,
who de&s;cribes, as an eye witne&s;s, the making of
tar on Mount Atlas, agrees in &s;ub&s;tance, with the
methods u&s;ed by the Macedonians of old, and the
people of New England at this day.</P>
<P>18. Jon&s;tonus in his Dendrographia, is of opi|nion,
that pitch was anciently made of cedar, as
well as of the pine and fir grown old and oily. It
&s;hould &s;eem indeed that one and the &s;ame word
was u&s;ed by the ancients in a large &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to
comprehend the juices i&s;&s;uing from all tho&s;e trees.
Tar and all &s;orts of ex&s;udations from evergreens
are, in a general acceptation, included under the
name re&s;in. Hard coar&s;e re&s;in or dry pitch is
made from tar, by letting it blaze till the moi&s;ture
is &s;pent. Liquid re&s;in is properly an oily vi&s;cid
juice oozing from the bark of evergreen trees, ei|ther
&s;pontaneou&s;ly or by inci&s;ion. It is thought to
be the oil of the bark in&s;pi&s;&s;ated by the &s;un. As,
it i&s;&s;ues from the tree it is liquid, but becomes dry
and hard being conden&s;ed by the &s;un or by fire.</P>
<P>19. According to Theophra&s;tus, re&s;in was ob|tained
by &s;tripping off the bark from pines, and
by inci&s;ions made in the &s;ilver fir and the pitch
pine. The inhabitants of Mount Ida, he tells us,
&s;tripped the trunk of the pine on the &s;unny &s;ide two
or three cubits from the ground. He ob&s;erves
that a good pine might be made to yield re&s;in
every year; an indifferent every other year; and
the weaker trees once in three years; and that
three runnings were as much as a tree could bear.
It is remarked by the &s;ame author, that a pine
doth not at once produce fruit and re&s;in, but the
former only in its youth, the later in its old age.</P>
<P>20. Turpentine is a fine re&s;in. Four kinds of
this are in u&s;e. The turpentine of Chios or Cy|prus
which flows from the Turpentine tree; the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Venice turpentine which is got by piercing the
Larch tree; the Stra&s;burgh Turpentine which
Mr. Ray informs us is procured from the knots of
the &s;ilver fir; it is fragrant and grows yellow with
age: The fourth kind is common turpentine neither
tran&s;parent, nor &s;o liquid as the former; and this
Mr. Ray taketh to flow from the mountain pine.
All the&s;e turpentines are u&s;eful in the &s;ame inten|tions.
Theophra&s;tus &s;aith the be&s;t re&s;in or turpen|tine
is got from the Terebinthus growing in Syria
and &s;ome of the Greek i&s;lands. The next be&s;t
from the &s;ilver fir and pitch pine.</P>
<P>21. Turpentine is on all hands allowed to have
great medicinal virtues. Tar and it's infu&s;ion
contain tho&s;e virtues. Tar-water is extremely pec|toral
and re&s;torative, and if I may judge, from
what experience I have had, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the mo&s;t
valuable qualities a&s;cribed to the &s;everal bal&s;ams
of Peru, of Tolu, of Capivi, and even to the balm
of Gilead; &s;uch is it's virtue in a&s;thmas and pleu|ri$ies,
in ob&s;tructions and ulcerous ero&s;ions of the
inward parts. Tar in &s;ub&s;tance mix'd with honey
I have found an excellent medicine for coughs.
Bal&s;ams as hath been already ob&s;erved are apt to
offend the &s;tomach. But tar-water may be taken
without offending the &s;tomach. For the &s;trength|ening
whereof it is the be&s;t medicine I have ever
tried.</P>
<P>22. The folly of man rateth things by their
&s;carcene&s;s, but Providence hath made the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful
things mo&s;t common. Among tho&s;e liquid
oily extracts from trees and &s;hrubs, which are
termed bal&s;ams, and valued for medicinal virtues,
tar may hold it's place as a mo&s;t valuable bal&s;am.
It's fragrancy &s;heweth, that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ac|tive
qualities, and it's oilyne&s;s, that it is fitted to
retain them. This excellent bal&s;am may be pur|cha&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="11">
for a penny a pound, whereas the bal&s;am of
Judaea, when mo&s;t plenty, was &s;old on the very
&s;pot that produced it, for double its weight in
&s;ilver, if we may credit Pliny; who al&s;o informs
us that the be&s;t bal&s;am of Judaea flowed only from
the bark, and that it was adulterated with re&s;in and
oyl of turpentine. Now comparing the vertues I
have experienced in Tar, with tho&s;e I find a&s;cribed
to the precious balm of Judaea, of Gilead, or of
Mecha (as it is diver&s;ly called) I am of opinion,
that the latter is not a medicine of more value or
efficacy than the former.</P>
<P>Pliny &s;uppo&s;ed amber to be a re&s;in, and to di&s;till
from &s;ome &s;pecies of pine, which he gathered from
it's &s;mell. Neverthele&s;s it's being dug out of the
earth &s;hews it to be a fo&s;&s;il, though of a very
different kind from other fo&s;&s;ils. But thus much
is certain, that the medicinal virtues of amber are
to be found in the bal&s;amic juices of pines and firs.
Particularly the virtues of the mo&s;t valuable pre|paration,
I mean &s;alt of amber, are in a great
degree an&s;wered by Tar-water, as a detergent,
diaphoretic, and diuretic.</P>
<P>24. There is, as hath been already ob&s;erved,
more or le&s;s oyl and bal&s;am in all evergreen trees,
which retains the acid &s;pirit, that principle of life
and verdure; the not retaining whereof in &s;ufficient
quantity, cau&s;eth other plants to droop and wither.
Of the&s;e evergreen trees productive of re&s;in, pitch,
and tar, Pliny enumerates &s;ix kinds in Europe;
Jon&s;tonus reckons up thrice that number of the pine
and fir family. And, indeed, their number, their
variety, and their likene&s;s makes it difficult to be
exact.</P>
<P>25. It is remarked both by Theophra&s;tus and
Jon&s;tonus, that trees growing in low and &s;hady
places do not yield &s;o good tar, as tho&s;e which
<PB N="13" REF="12">
grow in higher and more expo&s;ed &s;ituations. And
Theophra&s;tus further ob&s;erves, that the inhabitants
of mount Ida in A&s;ia, who di&s;tingui&s;h the Idaean
pine from the maritime, affirm, that the tar flow|ing
from the former is in greater plenty, as well as
more fragrant than the other. Hence it &s;hould
&s;eem, the pines or firs in the mountains of Scotland,
might be employed that way, and rendered valua|ble;
even where the timber, by it's remotene&s;s from
water-carriage, is of &s;mall value. What we call the
Scotch fir is fal&s;ly &s;o called, being in truth a wild
fore&s;t pine, and (as Mr. Ray informs us) agreeing
much with the de&s;cription of a pine growing on
mount Olympus in Phrygia, probably the only
place where it is found out of the&s;e i&s;lands; in
which of late years it is &s;o much planted and culti|vated
with &s;o little advantage, while the cedar of
Lebanon might perhaps be rai&s;ed, with little more
trouble, and much more profit and ornament.</P>
<P>26. The pines which differ from the firs in the
length and di&s;po&s;ition of their leaves and hardne&s;s
of the wood, do not, in Pliny's account, yield &s;o
much re&s;in as the fir trees. Several &s;pecies of both
are accurately de&s;cribed and delineated by the na|turali&s;ts.
But they all agree &s;o far as to &s;eem related.
Theophra&s;tus gives the preference to that re&s;in
which is got from the &s;ilver fir and pitch tree
(<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) before that yielded by the pine,
which yet, he &s;aith, is in greater plenty. Pliny,
on the contrary, affirms that the pine produceth
the &s;malle&s;t quantity. $It &s;hou'd &s;eem therefore that
the interpreter of Theophra&s;tus might have been
mi&s;taken, in rendering <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> by pinus, as well as
Jon&s;tonus, who likewi&s;e takes the pine for the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
of Theophra&s;tus. Hardouin will have the pinus
of Pliny to have been by others called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, but
by Theophra&s;tus <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ray thinks the common
<PB N="14" REF="13">
fir, or picea of the Latins to be the male fir of
Theophra&s;tus. This was probably the &s;pruce fir;
for the picea according to Pliny, yields much re&s;in,
loves a cold and mountainous &s;ituation, and is di|&s;tingui&s;hed,
ton&s;ili facilitate, by its fitne&s;s to be
&s;horn, which agrees with the &s;pruce fir, whereof I
have &s;een clo&s;e &s;horn hedges.</P>
<P>27. There &s;eems to have been &s;ome confu&s;ion in
the naming of the&s;e trees, as well among the an|cients
as the moderns. The ancient Greek and
Latin names are by later authors applied very dif|ferently.
Pliny himself acknowledgeth, it is not
ea&s;y even for the &s;kilful to di&s;tingui&s;h the trees by
their leaves, and know their &s;exes and kinds: and
that difficulty is &s;ince much encrea&s;ed, by the di&s;|covery
of many new &s;pecies of that ever-green tribe,
growing in various parts of the globe. But de&s;|criptions
are not &s;o ea&s;ily mi&s;applied as names.
Theophra&s;tus tells us, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> differeth from
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, among other things, in that it is neither &s;o
tall nor &s;o &s;treight, nor hath &s;o large a leaf. The
fir he di&s;tingui&s;heth into male and female: the
latter is &s;ofter timber than the male, it is al&s;o a taller
and fairer tree, and this is probably the &s;ilver fir.</P>
<P>28. To &s;ay no more on this ob&s;cure bu&s;ine&s;s
which I leave to the criticks, I &s;hall ob&s;erve that
according to Theophra&s;tus not only the turpentine
trees, the pines, and the firs yield re&s;in or tar, but
al&s;o the cedars and palm trees; and the words pix
and re&s;ina are taken by Pliny in &s;o large a &s;en&s;e as
to include the weepings of the Lenti&s;cus and Cypre&s;s,
and the balms of Arabia and Judaea; all which
perhaps are near of kin, and in their mo&s;t u&s;eful
qualities concur with common tar, e&s;pecially the
Norvegian, which is the mo&s;t liquid and be&s;t for
medicinal u&s;es of any that I have experienced.
Tho&s;e trees that grow on mountains, expo&s;ed to
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the &s;un or the north wind, are reckoned by Theo|phra&s;tus
to produce the be&s;t and pure&s;t Tar: And
the Idaean pines were di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e
growing on the plain, as yielding a thinner, &s;weeter,
and better &s;cented tar, all which differences I think
I have ob&s;erved, between the tar that comes from
Norway, and that which comes from low and
&s;wampy countries.</P>
<P>29. Agreeably to the old ob&s;ervation of the Pe|ripatetics,
that heat gathereth homogeneous things
and di&s;per&s;eth &s;uch as are heterogeneous, we find
chemi&s;try is fitted for the analy&s;is of bodies. But
the chemi&s;try of nature is much more perfect than
that of human art, ina&s;much as it joineth to the
power of heat that of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mechani&s;m.
Tho&s;e who have examined the &s;tructure of trees and
plants by micro&s;copes, have di&s;covered an admira|ble
variety of fine capillary tubes and ve&s;&s;els, fitted
for &s;everal purpo&s;es, as the imbibing or attracting
of proper nouri&s;hment, the di&s;tributing thereof
through all parts of the vegetable, the di&s;charge
of &s;uperfluities, the &s;ecretion of particular juices.
They are found to have ducts an&s;wering to the
tracheae in animals, for the conveying of air; they
have others an&s;wering to lacteals, arteries, and
veins. They feed, dige&s;t, re&s;pire, per&s;pire and
generate their kind, and are provided with organs
nicely fitted for all tho&s;e u&s;es.</P>
<P>30. The &s;ap ve&s;&s;els are ob&s;erved to be fine
tubes running up through the trunk from the root.
Secretory ve&s;&s;els are found in the bark, buds,
leaves, and flowers. Exhaling ve&s;&s;els for carrying
off excrementitious parts, are di&s;covered through|out
the whole &s;urface of the vegetable. And
(though this point be not &s;o well agreed) doctor
Grew in his Anatomy of plants, thinks there appears
<PB N="16" REF="15">
a circulation of the &s;ap, moving downwards in
the root, and feeding the trunk upwards.</P>
<P>31. Some difference indeed there is between
learned men, concerning the proper u&s;e of certain
parts of vegetables. But whether the di&s;coverers
have rightly gue&s;&s;ed at all their u&s;es or no, thus
much is certain, that there are innumerable fine
and curious parts in a vegetable body, and a won|derful
&s;imilitude or analogy between the mechani&s;m
of plants and animals. And perhaps &s;ome will
think it not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e the mechani&s;m
of plants more curious than even that of animals,
if we con&s;ider not only the &s;everal juices &s;ecreted
by different parts of the &s;ame plant, but al&s;o, the
endle&s;s variety of juices drawn and formed out of
the &s;ame &s;oil, by various &s;pecies of vegetables;
which mu&s;t therefore differ in an endle&s;s variety,
as to the texture of their absorbent ve&s;&s;els and &s;e|cretory
ducts.</P>
<P>32. A body, therefore, either animal or vege|table,
may be con&s;idered as an organi&s;ed &s;y&s;tem of
tubes and ve&s;&s;els, containing &s;everal &s;orts of fluids.
And as fluids are moved through the ve&s;&s;els of
animal bodies, by the &s;y&s;tole and dia&s;tole of the
heart, the alternate expan&s;ion and conden&s;ation of
the air, and the o&s;cillations in the membranes and
tunicks of the ve&s;&s;els; even &s;o by means of air ex|panded
and contracted in the tracheae or ve&s;&s;els
made up of ela&s;tic fibres, the &s;ap is propelled
through the arterial tubes of a plant, and the ve|getable
juices, as they are rarefied by heat or con|den&s;ed
by cold, will either a&s;cend and evaporate
into air, or de&s;cend in the form of a gro&s;s liquor.</P>
<P>33. Juices therefore, fir&s;t purified by &s;training
through the fine pores of the root, are afterwards
exalted by the action of the air and the ve&s;&s;els of
the plant, but, above all, by the action of the &s;un's
<PB N="17" REF="16">
light; which at the &s;ame time that it heats, doth
wonderfully rarefy and rai&s;e the &s;ap; till it per|&s;pires
and forms an atmo&s;phere, like the effluvia of
animal bodies. And though the leaves are &s;uppo&s;|ed
to perform principally the office of lungs,
breathing out excrementitious vapours and draw|ing
in alimentary; yet it &s;eems probable, that the
reciprocal actions of repul&s;ion and attraction, are
performed all over the &s;urface of vegetables, as
well as animals. In which reciprocation, Hippo|crates
&s;uppo&s;eth the manner of nature's acting, for
the nouri&s;hment and health of animal bodies, chie|fly
to con&s;i&s;t. And, indeed, what &s;hare of a plant's
nouri&s;hment is drawn through the leaves and bark,
from that ambient heterogeneous fluid called air, is
not ea&s;y to &s;ay. It &s;eems very con&s;iderable and al|together
nece&s;&s;ary, as well to vegetable as animal
life.</P>
<P>34. It is an opinion received by many, that the
&s;ap circulates in plants as the blood in animals:
that it a&s;cends through capillary arteries in the
trunk, into which are ino&s;culated other ve&s;&s;els of
the bark an&s;wering to veins, which bring back to
the root the remainder of the &s;ap, over and above
what had been depo&s;ited, during it's a&s;cent by the
arterial ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ecreted for the &s;everal u&s;es of
the vegetable throughout all it's parts, &s;tem,
branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit. Others deny
this circulation, and affirm that the &s;ap doth not
return through the bark ve&s;&s;els. It is neverthele&s;s
agreed by all, that there are a&s;cending and de&s;cend|ing
juices; while &s;ome will have the a&s;cent and de|&s;cent
to be a circulation of the &s;ame juices through
different ve&s;&s;els: others will have the a&s;cending
juice to be one &s;ort attracted by the root, and the
de&s;cending another imbibed by the leaves, or ex|tremities
of the branches: la&s;tly, others think that
<PB N="18" REF="17">
the &s;ame juice, as it is rarefied or conden&s;ed by
heat or cold, ri&s;es and &s;ub&s;ides in the &s;ame tube.
I &s;hall not take upon me to decide this controver&s;y.
Only I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the vulgar ar|gument
from analogy between plants and animals
lo&s;eth much of it's force, if it be con&s;idered, that
the &s;uppo&s;ed circulating of the &s;ap, from the root or
lacteals through the arteries, and thence return|ing,
by ino&s;culations, through the veins or bark
ve&s;&s;els to the root or lacteals again, is in no &s;ort
conformable or analogous to the circulation of the
blood.</P>
<P>35. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, what all mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
that a plant or tree is a very nice and
complicated machine<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">30, 31.</NOTE>; by the &s;everal parts and
motions whereof, the crude juices admitted through
the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, whether of the root, trunk,
or branches, are variou&s;ly mixed, &s;eparated, alte|red,
dige&s;ted, and exalted in a very wonderful
manner. The juice as it pa&s;&s;eth in and out, up
and down, through tubes of different textures,
&s;hapes, and &s;izes, and is affected by the alternate
compre&s;&s;ion and expan&s;ion of ela&s;tic ve&s;&s;els, by the
vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;ea&s;ons, the changes of weather, and
the various action of the &s;olar light, grows &s;till
more and more elaborate.</P>
<P>36. There is therefore no chemi&s;try like that of
nature, which addeth to the force of fire, the mo&s;t
delicate, various, and artificial percolation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">29.</NOTE> The
ince&s;&s;ant action of the &s;un upon the elements of
air, earth, and water, and on all &s;orts of mixed
bodies, animal, vegetable and fo&s;&s;il, is &s;uppo&s;ed
to perform all &s;orts of chemical operations. Whence
it &s;hould follow, that the air contains all &s;orts of
chemic productions, the vapours, fumes, oils, &s;alts,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and &s;pirits of all the bodies we know: from which
general aggregate or ma&s;s, tho&s;e that are proper
being drawn in, through the fine ve&s;&s;els of the
leaves, branches, and &s;tem of the tree, undergo
in its various organs, new alterations, &s;ecretions,
and dige&s;tions, till &s;uch time a$ they a&s;&s;ume the
mo&s;t elaborate form.</P>
<P>37. Nor is it to be wondered, that the peculiar
texture of each plant or tree, co-operating with the
&s;olar fire and pre-exi&s;ting juices, &s;hould &s;o alter the
fine nouri&s;hment drawn from earth and air,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">33.</NOTE> as
to produce various &s;pecific qualities of great effica|cy
in medicine: e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered that
in the opinion of learned men, there is an influ|ence
on plants derived from the &s;un, be&s;ides its
mere heat. Certainly doctor Grew, that curious
anatomi&s;t of plants, holds the &s;olar influence to
differ from that of a mere culinary fire, otherwi&s;e
than by being only a more temperate and equal
heat.</P>
<P>38. The alimentary juice taken into the lacteals,
whether of animals or vegetables, con&s;i&s;ts of oily,
aqueous, and &s;aline particles, which being di&s;&s;olv|ed,
volatili&s;ed, and diver&s;ly agitated, part thereof
is &s;pent and exhaled into the air; and that part
which remains is by the oeconomy of the plant, and
action of the &s;un, &s;trained, purified, concocted,
and ripened into an in&s;pi&s;&s;ated oil or bal&s;am, and
depo&s;ited in certain cells placed chiefly in the
bark, which is thought to an&s;wer the panniculus
adipo&s;us in animals, defending trees from the wea|ther,
and, when in &s;ufficient quantity, rendering
them evergreen. This bal&s;am, weeping or &s;weat|ing
through the bark, hardens into re&s;in; and this
mo&s;t copiou&s;ly in the &s;everal &s;pecies of pines and
<PB N="20" REF="19">
firs, who&s;e oil being in greater quantity, and more
tenacious of the acid &s;pirit or vegetable &s;oul (as
perhaps it may not improperly be called) abides the
action of the &s;un, and attracting the &s;un beams, is
thereby exalted and enriched, &s;o as to become a
mo&s;t noble medicine; &s;uch is the la&s;t product of a
tree, perfectly maturated by time and &s;un.</P>
<P>39. It is remarked by Theophra&s;tus, that all
plants and trees while they put forth have mo&s;t
humour, but when they have cea&s;ed to germinate
and bear, then the humour is &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
&s;heweth the nature of the plant, and that, there|fore,
trees yielding re&s;in &s;hould be cut after ger|mination.
It &s;eems al&s;o very rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e
the juice of old trees, who&s;e organs bring no
new &s;ap, &s;hould be better ripened than that of
others.</P>
<P>40. The aromatic flavours of vegetables &s;eem
to depend upon the &s;un's light, as much as colours.
As in the production of the later, the reflecting
powers of the object, &s;o in that of the former,
the attractive and organical powers of the plant
co-operatate with the &s;un<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">36, 37.</NOTE> And as from Sir
I&s;aac Newton's experiments it appears, that all co|lours
are virtually in the white light of the &s;un,
and &s;hew them&s;elves when the rays are &s;eparated
by the attracting and repelling powers of objects,
even &s;o the &s;pecific qualities of the elaborate juices
of plants, &s;eem to be virtually or eminently contain|ed
in the &s;olar light, and are actually exhibited
upon the &s;eparation of the rays, by the peculiar
powers of the capillary organs in vegetables, at|tracting
and imbibing certain rays, which produce
certain flavours and qualities, in like manner as
certain rays being reflected, produce certain co|lours.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
41. It hath been ob&s;erved by &s;ome curious ana|tomi&s;ts,
that the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els in the glands of
animal bodies are lined with a $ine down, which in
different glands is of different colours. And it is
thought, that each particular down, being origi|nally
imbued with it's own proper juice, attracts
none but that &s;ort; by which means &s;o many vari|ous
juices are &s;ecreted in different parts of the body.
And perhaps there may be &s;omething analogous to
this, in the fine ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of plants, which
may co-operate towards producing that endle&s;s va|riety
of juices, elaborated in plants from the &s;ame
earth and air.</P>
<P>42. The bal&s;am or e&s;&s;ential oil of vegetables
contains a &s;pirit, wherein con&s;i&s;t the &s;pecific quali|ties,
the &s;mell and ta&s;te of the plant. Boerhaave
holds the native pre&s;iding &s;pirit to be neither, oil,
&s;alt, earth, or water; but &s;omewhat too fine and
&s;ubtile to be caught alone and rendered vi&s;ible to
the eye. This when &s;uffered to fly off, for in|&s;tance,
from the oil of ro&s;emary, leaves it de&s;ti|tute
of all flavour. This &s;park of life, this &s;pirit
or &s;oul, if we may &s;o &s;ay, of the vegetable departs
without any &s;en&s;ible diminution of the oil or water
wherein it was lodged.</P>
<P>43. It &s;hould &s;eem that the $orms, &s;ouls, or
principles of vegetable life, &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the light or
&s;olar emanation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">40.</NOTE> which in re&s;pect of the mi|croco&s;m
is what the animal &s;pirit is to the micro|co&s;m;
the interior tegument, the &s;ubtile in&s;tru|ment
and vehicle of power. No wonder then that
the ens primum or &s;cintilla &s;pirituo&s;a, as it is cal|led,
of plants &s;hould be a thing &s;o $ine and &s;ugaci|cious
as to e&s;cape our nice&s;t &s;earch. It is evident
that nature at the &s;un's approach vegetates; and
<PB N="22" REF="21">
langui&s;hes at his rece&s;s; this terre&s;trial globe &s;eeming
only a matrix di&s;po&s;ed and prepared to receive life
from his light; whence Homer in his hymns &s;tyleth
earth the wife of heaven, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>44. The luminous &s;pirit which is the form or
life of a plant, from whence it's differences and
properties flow, is &s;omewhat extremely volatile.
It is not the oil, but a thing more &s;ubtile whereof
oil is the vehicle, which retains it from flying off,
and is lodged in &s;everal parts of the plant, parti|cularly
in the cells of the bark and in the &s;eeds.
This oil purified and exalted by the organical
powers of the plant, and agitated by warmth,
becomes a proper receptacle of the &s;pirit; part of
which &s;pirit exhales through the leaves and flowers,
and part is arre&s;ted by this unctuous humour that
detains it in the plant. It is to be noted this e&s;&s;en|tial
oil animated, as one may &s;ay, with the fla|vour
of the plant is very different from any &s;pirit,
that can be procured from the &s;ame plant by fer|mentation.</P>
<P>45. Light impregnates air,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">37, 4$.</NOTE> air impregnates
vapour; and this becomes a watery juice by di&s;til|lation
having ri&s;en fir&s;t in the cold &s;till with a
kindly gentle heat. This fragrant vegetable water is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pecific odour and ta&s;te of the
plant. It is remarked that di&s;tilled oils added to
water for counterfeiting the vegetable water can
never equal it, artificial chemi&s;try falling &s;hort of
the natural.</P>
<P>46. The le&s;s violence is u&s;ed to nature the bet|ter
its produce. The juice of olives or grapes i&s;|&s;uing
by the light pre&s;&s;ure is be&s;t. Re&s;ins that
drop from the branches &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or ooze
upon the &s;lighte&s;t inci&s;ion, are the fine&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="22">
fragrant. And infu&s;ions are ob&s;erved to act more
&s;trongly than decoctions of plants, the more &s;ub|tile
and volatile &s;alts and &s;pirits, which might be
lo&s;t or corrupted by the latter, being obtained in
their natural &s;tate by the former. It is al&s;o ob&s;er|ved
that the fine&s;t, pure&s;t, and mo&s;t volatile part
is that which fir&s;t a&s;cends in de&s;tillation. And,
indeed, it &s;hould &s;eem the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t active
particles required lea&s;t force to di&s;engage them from
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>47. The &s;alts, therefore, and more active &s;pirits
of the tar are got by infu&s;ion in cold water: but
the re&s;inous part is not to be di&s;&s;olved thereby
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>. Hence the prejudice which &s;ome perhaps may
entertain again&s;t Tar-water, as a medicine, the
u&s;e whereof might inflame the blood by it's &s;ul|phur
and re&s;in, appears to be not well grounded;
it being indeed impregnated with a fine acid &s;pi|rit,
bal&s;amic, cooling, diuretic, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
many other virtues<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sect. 42, 44.</NOTE>. Spirits are &s;uppo&s;ed to
con&s;i&s;t of &s;alts and phlegm, probably too &s;ome|what
of a fine oily nature, differing from oil in
that it mixeth with water, and agreeing with oil.
in that it runneth in rivulets by de&s;tillation. Thus
much is allowed, that the water, earth, and fixed
&s;alt are the &s;ame in all plants; that, therefore,
which differenceth a plant or makes it what it is,
the native &s;park or form, in the language of the
chemi&s;ts or &s;chools, is none of tho&s;e things, nor
yet the fine&s;t oil, which &s;eemeth only it's recep|tacle
or vehicle. It is ob&s;erved by chemi&s;ts, that
all &s;orts of bal&s;amic wood afford an acid &s;pirit,
which is the volatile oily &s;alt of the vegetable:
Herein is chiefly contained their medicinal virtues,
and by the trials I have made it appears, that the
<PB N="24" REF="23">
acid &s;pirit in tar-water, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the virtues, in
an eminent degree, of that of guaiacum, and other
medicinal woods.</P>
<P>48. Qualities in a degree too &s;trong for human
nature to &s;ubdue, and a&s;&s;imilate to it &s;elf, mu&s;t
hurt the con&s;titution. All acids, therefore, may
not be u&s;eful or innocent. But this &s;eemeth an
acid so thoroughly concocted, &s;o gentle, bland, and
temperate, and withal a &s;pirit &s;o fine and volatile,
as readily to enter the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and be a&s;&s;i|milated
with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e.</P>
<P>49. If any one were minded to di&s;&s;olve &s;ome
of the re&s;in, together with the &s;alt or &s;pirit, he
need only mix &s;ome &s;pirit of wine with the water.
But &s;uch an intire &s;olution of re&s;ins and gums, as
to qualify them for entering and pervading the
animal &s;y&s;tem, like the fine acid &s;pirit that fir&s;t
flies off from the &s;ubject, is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to
obtain. It is an apopthegm of the chemi&s;ts, deri|ved
from Helmont, that whoever can make myrrh
&s;oluble by the human body, has the &s;ecret of pro|longing
his days: and Boerhaave owns that there
&s;eems to be truth in this, from it's re&s;i&s;ting putre|$action.
Now this quality is as remarkable in tar,
with which the ancients embalmed and pre&s;erved
dead bodies. And though Boerhaave him&s;elf, and
other chemi&s;ts before him, have given methods
$or making &s;olutions of myrrh, yet it is by means
of alcohol which extracts only the inflammable
parts. And it doth not &s;eem that any &s;olution
of myrrh is impregnated with it's &s;alt or acid &s;pi|rit.
It may not, therefore, &s;eem &s;trange if this
water &s;hould be &s;ound more beneficial for procu|ring
health and long life, than any &s;olution of
myrrh what&s;oever.</P>
<P>50. Certainly divers re&s;ins and gums may have
virtues, and yet not be able for their gro&s;&s;ne&s;s to
<PB N="25" REF="24">
pa&s;s the lacteals and other finer ve&s;&s;els, nor yet,
perhaps, readily impart tho&s;e virtues to a men|&s;truum,
that may with &s;afety and &s;peed convey
them throughout the human body. Upon all
which accounts, I believe tar-water will be found
to have &s;ingular advantages. It is ob&s;erved that
acid &s;pirits prove the &s;tronger, by how much the
greater degree of heat is required to rai&s;e them.
And indeed, there &s;eemeth to be no acid more
gentle than this, obtained by the &s;imple affu&s;ion of
cold water; which carries off from the &s;ubject the
mo&s;t light and &s;ubtile parts, and, if one may &s;o
&s;peak, the very flower of it's &s;pecific qualities.
And here it is to be noted, that the volatile &s;alt
and &s;pirit of vegetables do, by gently &s;timulating
the &s;olids, attenuate the fluids contained in them,
and promote &s;ecretions, and that they are pene|trating
and active, contrary to the general nature
of other acids.</P>
<P>51. It is a great maxim for health, that the
juices of the body be kept fluid in a due propor|tion.
Therefore, the acid volatile &s;pirit in tar-water,
at once attenuating and cooling in a mode|rate
degree, mu&s;t greatly conduce to health, as a
mild &s;alutary deob&s;truent, quickening the circula|tion
of the fluids without wounding the &s;olids,
thereby gently removing of preventing tho&s;e ob|&s;tructions,
which are the great and general cau&s;e
of mo&s;t chronical di&s;ea&s;es; in this manner an&s;wer|ing
to the antihy&s;terics, a&s;&s;a foetida galbanum,
myrrh, amber, and, in general, to all the re&s;ins
and gums of trees or &s;hrubs u&s;eful in nervous
ca&s;es.</P>
<P>52. Warm water is it &s;elf a deob&s;truent. There|fore
the in$u&s;ion of tar drank warm, is ea&s;ier in&s;i|nuated
into all the nice capillary ve&s;&s;els, and acts,
not only by virtue of the bal&s;am, but al&s;o by that
<PB N="26" REF="25">
of the vehicle. It's ta&s;te, it's diuretic quality, it's
being &s;o great a cordial, &s;hew the activity of this
medicine. And at the &s;ame time that it quickens
the &s;luggish blood of the hy&s;terical, it's bal&s;amic
oily nature abates the too rapid motion of the &s;harp
thin blood in tho&s;e who are hectic. There is a
lentour and &s;moothne&s;s in the blood of healthy
&s;trong people; on the contrary, there is often an
acrimony and &s;olution in that of weakly morbid
per&s;ons. The fine particles of tar are not only
warm and active, they are al&s;o bal&s;amic and emol|lient,
&s;oftening and enriching the &s;harp and vapid
blood, and healing the ero&s;ions occa&s;ioned thereby
in the blood-ve&s;&s;els and glands.</P>
<P>53. Tar-water po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the &s;tomachic and car|diac
qualities of elixir proprietatis, Stoughton's
drops, and many &s;uch tinctures and extracts, with
this difference, that it worketh it's effect more
&s;afely, as it hath nothing of that &s;pirit of wine,
which, however mixed and di&s;gui&s;ed, may yet be well
accounted a poi&s;on in &s;ome degree.</P>
<P>54. Such medicines are &s;uppo&s;ed to be diapho|retic,
which being of an active and &s;ubtile nature,
pa&s;s through the whole &s;y&s;tem, and work their
effect in the fine&s;t capillaries and per&s;piratory
ducts, which they gently clean&s;e and open. Tar-water
is extremely well fitted to work by &s;uch an
in&s;en&s;ible diaphore&s;is, by the &s;inene&s;s and activity
of i$$s acid volatile &s;pirit. And &s;urely tho&s;e parts
$$ght to be very $ine, which can &s;cour the per|&s;piratory
ducts, under the &s;carf &s;kin or cuticle,
i$ it be true that one grain of &s;and, would co|ver
the mouths of more than a hundred thou|sand.</P>
<P>55. Another way wherein tar-water operates,
is by urine, than which perhaps none is more &s;afe
and effectual, for clean&s;ing the blood and carrying
<PB N="27" REF="26">
off it's &s;alts. But it &s;eems to produce it's princi|pal
effect as an alterative, &s;ure and ea&s;y, much
&s;afer than tho&s;e vehement purgative, emetic, and
&s;alivating medicines, which do violence to nature.</P>
<P>56. An ob&s;truction of &s;ome ve&s;&s;els cau&s;eth the
blood to move more &s;wiftly in other ve&s;&s;els, which
are not ob&s;tructed. Hence manifold di&s;orders. A
liquor that dilutes and attenuates re&s;olves the con|cretions
which ob&s;truct. Tar-water is &s;uch a li|quor.
It may be &s;aid, indeed, of common water,
that it attenuates, al&s;o of mercurial preparations
that they attenuate. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered
that mere water only di&s;tends the ve&s;&s;els and there|by
weakens their tone; and that Mercury by it's
great momentum may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected of hurt|ing
the fine capillaries, which two deob&s;truents
therefore might ea&s;ily overact their parts, and (by
le&s;&s;ening the force of the ela&s;tic ve&s;&s;els) remotely
produce tho&s;e concretions they are intended to
remove.</P>
<P>57. Weak and rigid fibres are looked on by
the mo&s;t able phy&s;icians, as &s;ources of two differ|ent
cla&s;&s;es of di&s;tempers: a &s;luggi&s;h motion of the
liquids occa&s;ions weak fibres: therefore tar-water
is good to &s;trengthen them as it gently accelerates
their contents. On the other hand, being an un|ctuous
bland $luid it moi&s;tens and &s;o$tens the dry
and &s;tiff $ibres: and &s;o proves a remedy for both
extremes.</P>
<P>58. Common &s;oaps are compo&s;itions of lixivial
&s;alt and oil. The corro&s;ive acrimony of the &s;a|line
particles, being &s;oftened by the mixture of an
unctuous &s;ub&s;tance they in&s;inuate them&s;elves into
the &s;mall ducts with le&s;s difficulty and danger.
The combination of the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances
makes up a very &s;ubtile and active medicine, $it|ted
for mixing with all humours, and re&s;olving
<PB N="28" REF="27">
all ob&s;tructions. Soap therefore is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed
a mo&s;t efficacious medicine in many di&s;tempers.
Alcaline &s;oap is allowed to be clean&s;ing, attenuat|ing,
opening, re&s;olving, &s;weetening; it is pectoral,
vulnerary, diuretic, and hath other good qualities
which are al&s;o to be found in Tar-water. It is
granted, that oyl and acid salts combined together
exi&s;t in vegetables, and that con&s;equently there are
acid &s;oaps as well as alcaline. And the &s;apona|ceous
nature of the acid vegetable &s;pirits, is what
renders them &s;o diuretic, &s;udorific, penetrating,
ab&s;ter&s;ive and re&s;olving. Such, for in&s;tance, is the
acid &s;pirit of Guaiacum. And all the&s;e &s;ame virtues
&s;eem to be in Tar-water in a mild and &s;alutary
degree.</P>
<P>59. It is the general opinion that all acids coa|gulate
the blood. Boerhaave excepts vinegar which
he holds to be a &s;oap, ina&s;much as it is found to
contain an oyl as well as an acid &s;pirit. Hence it
is both unctuous and penetrating, a powerful anti|phlogi&s;tic,
and pre&s;ervative again&s;t corruption and
infection. Now it &s;eems evident that Tar-water
is a soap as well as vinegar. For though it be
the character of re&s;in, which is an in&s;pi&s;&s;ated gro&s;s
oyl, not to di&s;&s;olve in water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 47.</NOTE>, yet the &s;alts at|tr$ct
&s;ome $ine particles of e&s;&s;ential oyl: which fine
oyl &s;erves as a vehicle for the acid salts, and &s;hews
it&s;elf in the colour of the Tar-water: for all pure
&s;alts are colourle&s;s. And though the re&s;in will
not di&s;&s;olve in water, yet the &s;ubtile oyl, in which
the vegetable &s;alts are lodged, may as well mix
with water as vinegar doth, which contains both
oyl and &s;alt. And as the oyl in Tar-water di&s;covers
itself to the eye, &s;o the acid salts do manife&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="28">
them&s;elves to the ta&s;te. Tar-water therefore is a
&s;oap, and as &s;uch hath the medicinal qualities of
&s;oaps.</P>
<P>60. It operates more gently as the acid &s;alts
lo&s;e their acrimony being &s;heathed in oyl, and
thereby approaching the nature of neutral &s;alts,
are more benign and friendly to the animal &s;y|&s;tem:
and more effectually, as by the help of a vo|latile
&s;mooth in&s;inuating oyl, tho&s;e &s;ame &s;alts are
more ea&s;ily introduced into the capillary ducts.
Therefore in fevers and epidemical di&s;tempers it
is (and I have found it &s;o) as well as in chroni|cal
di&s;ea&s;es, a mo&s;t &s;afe and efficacious medicine,
being good again&s;t too great fluidity as a bal&s;a|mic,
and good again&s;t vi&s;cidity as a &s;oap. There
is &s;omething in the fiery corro&s;ive nature of lixi|vial
&s;alts, which makes alcaline &s;oap a dangerous
remedy in all ca&s;es where an inflammation is appre|hended.
And as inflammations are often occa&s;ioned
by ob&s;tructions, it &s;hould &s;eem an acid &s;oap was
much the &s;afer deob&s;truent.</P>
<P>61. Even the be&s;t turpentines, however famous
for their vulnerary and detergent qualities, have
yet been ob&s;erved by their warmth to di&s;po&s;e to
inflammatory tumours. But the acid &s;pirit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7. 8.</NOTE> being
in &s;o great proportion in Tar-water renders it a
cooler and &s;afer medicine. And the aetherial oyl of
turpentine, though an admirable dryer, healer, and
anodyne, when outwardly applyed to wounds and
ulcers, and not le&s;s u&s;eful in clean&s;ing the urinary
pa&s;&s;ages and healing their ulcerations, yet is known
to be of a nature &s;o very relaxing as &s;ometimes to
do much mi&s;chief. Tar-water is not attended with
the &s;ame ill effects, which I believe are owing in
a great mea&s;ure to the aetherial oyls being deprived
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of the acid &s;pirit in di&s;tillation, which vellicating
and contracting as a &s;timulus might have proved
a conterpoi&s;e to the exce&s;&s;ive lubricating and re|laxing
qualities of the oyl.</P>
<P>62. Woods in decoction do not &s;eem to yield &s;o
ripe and elaborate a juice, as that which is depo|&s;ited
in the cells or loculi terebinthiaci, and &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
oozes from them. And indeed though
the bal&s;am of Peru obtained by boiling wood and
&s;cumming the decoction, be a very valuable medi|cine
and of great account in divers ca&s;es, particu|larly
a&s;thmas, nephretic pains, nervous colics and
ob&s;tructions, yet I do verily think (and I do not
&s;ay this without experience) that Tar-water is a
more efficacious remedy in all tho&s;e ca&s;es than even
that costly drug.</P>
<P>63. It hath been already ob&s;erved that the re&s;to|rative
pectoral antihy&s;terical virtues of the mo&s;t pre|cious
bal&s;ams and gums are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a high de|gree
by Tar-water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 9. 21. 22. 23.</NOTE>. And I do not know any
purpo&s;e an&s;wered by the wood drinks, for which
Tar-water may not be u&s;ed with at lea&s;t equal &s;uc|ce&s;s.
It contains the virtues even of Guaiacum
which &s;eems the mo&s;t efficacious of all the woods,
warming and &s;weetening the humours, diaphoretic
and u&s;eful in gouts, drop&s;ies and rheums, as well
as in the foul di&s;ea&s;e. Nor &s;hould it &s;eem &s;trange,
if the virtues obtained by boiling an old dry wood
prove inferior to tho&s;e extracted from a bal&s;am.</P>
<P>64. There is a fine volatile &s;pirit in the waters
of Geron&s;ter, the mo&s;t e&s;teemed of all the fountains
about Spa, but who&s;e waters do not bear tran&s;port|ing.
The &s;tomachic, cardiac, and diuretic qualities
of this $ountain &s;omewhat re&s;emble tho&s;e of Tar-water,
which, if I am not greatly mi&s;taken, con|tains
the virtues of the best chalibeat and &s;ulphur|eous
<PB N="31" REF="30">
waters; with this difference, that tho&s;e waters
are apt to affect the head in taking, which Tar-water
is not. Be&s;ides there is a regimen of diet
to be ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially with chalybeat waters,
which I never found nece&s;&s;ary with this. Tar-water
layeth under no re&s;traint either as to diet,
hours, or employment. A man may &s;tudy, or
exercise or repo&s;e, keep his own hours, pa&s;s his
time either within or without, and take whole&s;ome
nouri&s;hment of any kind.</P>
<P>65. The u&s;e of mineral waters, however excel|lent
for the nerves and &s;tomach, is often &s;u&s;pended
by colds and inflammatory di&s;orders; in which they
are acknowledged to be very dangerous. Whereas
Tar-water is &s;o far from hurting in tho&s;e ca&s;es, or
being di&s;continued on that account, that it greatly
contributes to their cure<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>66. Cordials, vulgarly &s;o called, act immedi|ately
on the &s;tomach, and by con&s;ent of nerves
on the head. But medicines of an operation too
fine and light to produce a &s;en&s;ible effect in the
primae viae, may, neverthele&s;s, in their pa&s;&s;ages
through the capillaries, operate on the &s;ides of tho&s;e
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, in &s;uch manner as to quicken their
o&s;cillations, and con&s;equently the motion of their
contents, producing in i&s;&s;ue and effect, all the be|nefits
of a cordial much more la&s;ting and &s;alutary
than tho&s;e of fermented &s;pirits, which by their
cau&s;tic and coagulating qualities do incomparably
more mi&s;chief than good. Such a cardiac medi|cine
is Tar-water. The tran&s;ient fits of mirth,
produced from fermented liquors, are attended
with proportionable depre&s;&s;ions of &s;pirit in their
intervals. But the calm chearfulne&s;s ari&s;ing from
<PB N="32" REF="31">
this water of health (as it may be ju&s;tly called) is
permanent. In which it emulates the virtues of
that famous plant Gen Seng, &s;o much valued in
China as the only cordial that rai&s;eth the &s;pirits
without depre&s;&s;ing them. Tar-water is &s;o far from
hurting the nerves as common cordials do, that it
is highly u&s;eful in cramps, &s;pa&s;ms of the vi&s;cera,
and paralytic numbne&s;s.</P>
<P>67. Emetics are on certain occa&s;ions admini&s;tred
with great &s;ucce&s;s. But the over&s;training and
weakening of nature may be very ju&s;tly apprehend|ed
from a cour&s;e of emetics. They are neverthele&s;s
pre&s;cribed and &s;ub&s;tituted for exerci&s;e. But it is
well remarked in Plato's Timaeus that vomits and
purges are the wor&s;t exerci&s;e in the world. There
is &s;omething in the mild operation of Tar-water,
that &s;eems more friendly to the oeconomy, and
forwards the dige&s;tions and &s;ecretions in a way more
natural and benign, the mildne&s;s of this medicine
being &s;uch that I have known children take it, for
above &s;ix months together, with great benefit, and
without any inconvenience; and after long and
repeated experience I do e&s;teem it a mo&s;t excellent
diet drink fitted to all &s;ea&s;ons and ages.</P>
<P>68. It is I think allowed that the origine of
the gout lies in a faulty dige&s;tion. And it is
remarked by the able&s;t phy&s;icians, that the gout
is &s;o difficult to cure, becau&s;e heating medicines
aggravate it's immediate, and cooling it's remote
cau&s;e. But Tar-water, although it contain active
principles that strenghten the dige&s;tion beyond any
thing I know, and consequently mu&s;t be highly
u&s;eful, either to prevent or le&s;&s;en the following
fit, or by envigorating the blood to ca&s;t it upon
the extremities, yet it is not of &s;o heating a na|ture
as to do harm even in the fit. Nothing is
<PB N="25" REF="32" MS="Y">
more difficult or di&s;agreeable than to argue men
out of their prejudices; I &s;hall not therefore enter
into controver&s;ies on this &s;ubject, but $span$ di&s;|pute
and object, &s;hall leave the deci&s;ion to time
and trial.</P>
<P>69. In the modern practice, &s;oap, op$um, and
mercury bid faire&s;t for univer&s;al medicines. The
fir&s;t of the&s;e is highly &s;poken of. But then tho&s;e
who magnify it mo&s;t, except again&s;t the u&s;e of it in
such ca&s;es where the ob&s;truction is attended with a
putrefactive alkali, or where an inflammatory di&s;|po&s;ition
appears. It is acknowledged to be very
dangerous in a pthi&s;is, fever, and &s;ome other
ca&s;es in which tar-water is not only &s;afe but u&s;e|ful.</P>
<P>70. Opium, though a medicine of great extent
and efficacy, yet is frequently known to produce
grievous di&s;orders in hy&s;terical or hypochondriacal
per&s;ons, who make a great part, perhaps the
greate&s;t of tho&s;e who lead &s;edentary lives in the&s;e
i&s;lands. Be&s;ides, upon all con&s;titutions dangerous
errors may be committed in the u&s;e of opium.</P>
<P>71. Mercury hath of late years become a medi|cine
of very general u&s;e. The extreme minutene&s;s,
mobility, and momentum of its parts, rendering
it a mo&s;t powerful clean&s;er of all ob&s;tructions,
even in the mo&s;t minute capillaries. But then we
&s;hould be cautious in the u&s;e of it, if we con&s;ider,
that the very thing which gives it power or do|ing
good above other deob&s;truents, doth al&s;o di&s;|po&s;e
it to do mi&s;chief. I mean its great momentum,
the weight of it being about ten times that of
blood, and the momentum being the joint pro|duct
of the weight and velocity, it mu&s;t needs
operate with great force; and may it not be ju&s;tly
feared, that &s;o great a &s;orce entring the minute&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="33" MS="Y">
ve&s;&s;els, and breaking the ob&s;tructed matter, might
al&s;o break or wound the fine tender coats of tho&s;e
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o bring on the untimely effects
of old age, producing more, perhaps, and wor&s;e
ob&s;tructions than tho&s;e it removed? Similar con&s;e|quences
may ju&s;tly be apprehended from other mi|neral
and ponderous medicines. Therefore, upon
the whole, there will not perhaps be found any
medicine, more general in its u&s;e, or more &s;alu|tary
in its effects than tar-water.</P>
<P>72. To &s;uppo&s;e that all di&s;temper&s; ari&s;ing from
very different, and it may be from contrary
cau&s;es, can be cured by one and &s;ame medi|cine
mu&s;t &s;eem chimerical. But it may with truth
be affirmed, that the virtue of tar-water extends to
a &s;urpri&s;ing variety of ca&s;es very di&s;tant and un|like
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3, 4, 5, 6&punc; 21&punc; <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> This I have experienced in my neigh|bours,
my family, and my&s;elf. And as I live in a
remote corner among poor neighbours, who for
want of a regular phy&s;ician have often recour&s;e to
me, I have had frequent opportunities of trial,
which convince me it is of &s;o ju&s;t a temperament as
to be an enemy to all extremes. I have known it
do great good in a cold watery con&s;titution, as a
cardiac and &s;tomachic; and at the &s;ame time allay
heat and feveri&s;h thir&s;t in another. I have known it
correct costive habits in &s;ome, and the contrary
habit in others. Nor will this &s;eem incredible if
it be con&s;idered that middle qualities naturally re|duce
the extreme. Warm water, for in&s;tance,
mixed with hot and cold will le&s;&s;en the heat in
that, and the cold in this.</P>
<P>73. They who know the great virtues of com|mon
&s;oap, who&s;e coar&s;e lixivial &s;alts are the pro|duct
<PB N="27" REF="34">
of culinary fire, will not think it incredible,
that virtues of mighty force and extent &s;hould be
found in a fine acid &s;oap<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">58.</NOTE> the &s;alts and oil
whereof, are a mo&s;t elaborate product of nature
and the &s;olar light.</P>
<P>74. It is certain tar-water warms, and therefore
&s;ome may perhaps &s;till think it cannot cool. The
more effectually to remove this prejudice, let it be
farther con&s;idered, that, as on one the hand, oppo&s;ite
cau&s;es do &s;ometimes produce the &s;ame effect, for
in&s;tance, heat by rarefaction and cold by conden|sation
do both increa&s;e the air's ela&s;ticity: &s;o on
the other hand, the &s;ame cau&s;e &s;hall &s;ometime
produce oppo&s;ite effects: heat for in&s;tance in one
degree thins, in another coagulates the blood. It
is not therefore &s;trange that tar-water &s;hould warm
one habit, and cool another, have one good effect
on a cold con&s;titution, and another good effect on
an inflamed one, nor, if this be so, that it &s;hould
cure oppo&s;ite di&s;orders. All which ju&s;tifies to rea|&s;on,
what I have often found true in fact. The
&s;alts, the &s;pirits, the heat of tar-water are of a
temperature congenial to the con&s;titution of a man
which receives from it a kindly warmth, but no
inflaming heat. It was remarkable that two chil|dren
in my neighbourhood, being in a course of
tar-water, upon an intermi&s;&s;ion of it, never failed
to have their i&s;&s;ues inflamed by a humour much more
hot and &s;harp than at other times. But its great
u&s;e in the &s;mall-pox, pleuri&s;ies, and fevers, is a
&s;ufficient proof that tar-water is not of an inflam|ing
nature.</P>
<P>75. I have dwelt the longer on this head, becau&s;e
&s;ome gentlemen of the faculty have thought fit to
<PB N="28" REF="35" MS="Y">
declare that tar-water mu&s;t enflame, and that they
would never vi&s;it any patient in a fever, who had
been a drinker of it. But I will venture to affirm,
that it is &s;o far from increa&s;ing a feveri&s;h inflam|mation,
that it is on the contrary a mo&s;t ready means
to allay and extingui&s;h it. It is of admirable u&s;e
in fevers, being at the &s;ame time the &s;ure&s;t, &s;afe&s;t
and mo&s;t effectual both paregoric and cordial; for
the truth of which, I appeal to any per&s;on's ex|perience,
who &s;hall take a large draught of it
milk warm in the paroxy&s;m of a fever, even when
plain water or herb teas &s;hall be found to have little
or no effect. To me it &s;eems that it's &s;ingular and
&s;urprizing u&s;e in fevers of all kinds, were there
nothing el&s;e, would be alone &s;ufficient to recom|mend
it to the public.</P>
<P>76. The be&s;t phy&s;icians make the idea of a fe|ver
to con&s;ist in a too great velocity of the heart's
motion, and too great re&s;i&s;tance at the capillaries.
Tar-water, as it &s;oftens and gently &s;timulates tho&s;e
nice ve&s;&s;els, helps to propel their contents, and &s;o
contributes to remove the latter part of the di&s;or|der.
And for the former, the irritating acrimony
which accelerates the motion of the heart is dilute|ed
by watery, corrected by acid, and &s;oftened by
bal&s;amic remedies, all which intentions are an&s;wer|ed
by this aqueous acid bal&s;amic medicine. Be|&s;ides
the vi&s;cid juices coagulated by the febrile heat
are re&s;olved by tar-water as a &s;oap, and not too far
re&s;olved, as it is a gentle acid &s;oap; to which we
may add, that the peccant humours and &s;alts are
carried off by its diaphoretic and diuretic quali|ties.</P>
<P>77. I found all this confirmed by my own expe|rience
in the late &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on of the year one thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and forty-one, having had
<PB N="29" REF="36" MS="Y">
twenty-five fevers in my own family cured by this
medicinal water, drunk copiou&s;ly. The &s;ame me|thod
was practi&s;ed on &s;everal of my poor neigh|bours
with equal &s;ucce&s;s. It &s;uddenly calmed the
feveri&s;h anxieties, and &s;eemed every gla&s;s to re|fre&s;h,
and in$u&s;e life and &s;pirit into the patient.
At first &s;ome of tho&s;e patients had been vomited;
but afterwards I found that without vomiting,
bleeding, bli&s;tering or any other evacuation or me|dicine
whatever, very bad &s;evers could be cured by
the &s;ole drinking of tar-water milk warm, and in
good quantity, perhaps a large gla&s;s every hour
taken in bed. And it was remarkable, that &s;uch
as were cured by this comfortable cordial, reco|vered
health and &s;pirits at once, while tho&s;e who
had been cured by evacuations often langui&s;hed
long, even after the fever had left them, before
they could recover of their medicines and regain
their &s;trength.</P>
<P>78. In peripneumonies and pleuri&s;ies I have ob|&s;erved
tar-water to be excellent, having known
&s;ome pleuritic per&s;ons cured without bleeding, by
a bli&s;ter early applied to the &s;titch, and the copi|ous
drinking of tar-water, four or five quarts, or
even more in four and twenty hours. And I do
recommend it to farther trial, whether in all ca&s;es
of a pleuri&s;y, one moderate bleeding, a bli&s;ter on
the &s;pot and plenty of tepid tar-water may not &s;uffice,
without tho&s;e repeated and immoderate
bleedings, the bad effects of which are perhaps
never got over. I do even &s;u&s;pect that a pleuritic
patient betaking himself to bed betimes, and
drinking very copiou&s;ly of tar-water, may be cur|ed
by that alone without bleeding, bli&s;tering, or
any other medicine whatever: certainly I have
found this &s;ucceed at a gla&s;s every half hour.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">
79. I have known a bloody flux of long conti|nuance,
after divers medicine had been tried in
vain, cured by tar-water. But that which I take
to be the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual remedy in a
bloody flux, is a cly&s;ter of an ounce of common
brown ro&s;in di&s;&s;olved over a fire in two ounces of
oil, and added to a pint of broth, which not long
&s;ince I had frequent occa&s;ion of trying, when that
di&s;temper was epidemical. Nor can I &s;ay that any
to whom I advi&s;ed it mi&s;carried. This experi|ment
I was led to make by the opinion I had of
tar as a bal&s;amic: and ro&s;in is only tar in&s;pi&s;|&s;ated.</P>
<P>80. Nothing that I know corroborates the &s;to|mach
&s;o much as tar-water<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sect. 68.</NOTE> Whence it fol|lows,
that it mu&s;t be of &s;ingular u&s;e to per&s;ons af|flicted
with the gout. And from what I have ob&s;erved
in five or &s;ix in&s;tances, I do verily believe it the
be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t medicine either to prevent the gout,
or &s;o to &s;trengthen nature again&s;t the fit, as to
drive it from the vitals. Doctor Sydenham in his
treati&s;e of the gout, delares that whoever finds a
medicine the mo&s;t efficacious for &s;trengthening di|ge&s;tion,
will do more &s;ervice in the cure of that
and other chronical di&s;tempers, than he can even
form a notion of. And I leave it to trial, whether
tar-water be not that medicine, as I my&s;elf am per|&s;uaded
it is, by all the experiments I could make.
But in all trials I wou'd recommend di&s;cretion; for
in&s;tance, a man with the gout in his &s;tomach ought
not to drink cold tar-water. This e&s;&s;ay leaves room
for future experiment in every part of it, not pre|tending
to be a compleat treati&s;e.</P>
<P>81. It is evident to &s;en&s;e, that blood, urine,
and other animal juices, being let to &s;tand, &s;oon
<PB N="31" REF="38">
contract a great acrimony. Juices, therefore from
a bad dige&s;tion, retained and &s;tagnating in the
body, grow &s;harp and putrid. Hence a ferment|ing
heat, the immediate cau&s;e of the gout. The
curing this by cooling medicines, as they would
increa&s;e the antecedent cau&s;e, must be a vain at|tempt.
On the other hand, &s;pices and &s;pirituous
liquors, while they contribute to remove the ante|cedent
cau&s;e, or bad dige&s;tion, would by infla|ming
the blood increa&s;e the proximate or immedi|ate
cau&s;e of the gout, to wit, the fermenting heat.
The &s;cope therefore mu&s;t be, to find a medicine
that &s;hall corroborate, but not inflame. Bitter
herbs are recommended; but they are weak in com|pari&s;on
of tar-water.</P>
<P>82. The great force of tar-water, to correct the
acrimony of the blood, appears in nothing more
than in the cure of a gangrene, from an internal
cau&s;e; which was performed on a &s;ervant of my
own, by prescribing the copious and con&s;tant u&s;e
of tar-water for a few weeks. From my repre|&s;enting
tar-water as good for &s;o many things, &s;ome
perhaps may conclude it is good for nothing. But
charity obligeth me to say, what I know, and what
I think, how&s;oever it may be taken. Men may
cen&s;ure and object as they plea&s;e, but I appeal to
time and experiment. Effects mi&s;imputed, ca&s;es
wrong told, circum&s;tances overlooked, perhaps
too, prejudices and partialities again&s;t truth, may
for a time prevail and keep her at the bottom of
her well, from whence neverthele&s;s &s;he emergeth
&s;ooner or later, and &s;trikes the eyes of all who do
not keep them &s;hut.</P>
<P>83. Boerhaave thinks a &s;pecific may be found,
for that peculiar venom, which infects the blood in
the &s;mall-pox, and that the pro&s;pect of &s;o great
a public benefit &s;hould &s;tir up men to &s;earch for it.
<PB N="32" REF="39" MS="Y">
It's wonderful &s;ucce&s;s in preventing and mitigating
that di&s;temper,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2, 3.</NOTE> would incline one to &s;u&s;pect
that tar-water is such a &s;pecific. Some think an
Ery&s;ipelas and the Plague differ only in degree.
If so, tar-water &s;hould be u&s;eful in the Plague, for
I have known it cure an Ery&s;ipelas.</P>
<P>84. Tar-water, as clean&s;ing, healing, and bal|&s;amic,
is good in all di&s;orders of the urinary pa&s;&s;a|ges,
whether ob&s;tructed or ulcerated. Doctor
Li&s;ter &s;uppo&s;eth, indeed, that turpentines act by
a cau&s;tic quality, which irritates the coats of the
urinary ducts to expel &s;and or gravel. But it
&s;hould &s;eem this expelling diuretic virtue, con&s;i&s;ted
rather in the &s;alts than the re&s;in, and con&s;equently
re&s;ides in the tar-water, gently &s;timulating by it's
&s;alts, without the dangerous force of a cau&s;tic.
The violent operation of Ipecacuanha lies in it's
re&s;in, but the &s;aline extract is a gentle purge and
diuretic, by the &s;timulus of it's &s;alts.</P>
<P>85. That which acts as a mild cordial,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> nei|ther
hurting the capillary ve&s;&s;els as a cau&s;tic, nor
affecting the nerves, nor coagulating the juices,
mu&s;t in all ca&s;es be a friend to nature, and a&s;&s;i&s;t
the vis vitae in it's &s;truggle again&s;t all kinds of
contagion. And from what I have ob&s;erved, tar-water
appears to me an u&s;eful preservative in all
epidemical di&s;orders, and again&s;t all other infecti|on
what&s;oever, as well as that of the &s;mall-pox.
What effects the animi pathemata have in humane
maladies, is well known, and con&s;equently the ge|neral
benefit of &s;uch a cardiac cannot be doubted.</P>
<P>86. As the body is &s;aid to cloath the &s;oul, &s;o
the nerves may be &s;aid to con&s;titute her inner gar|ment.
And as the &s;oul animates the whole, what
<PB N="41" REF="40">
nearly touches the &s;oul relates to all. Therefore
the a&s;perity of tartarous &s;alts, and the fiery acri|mony
of alcaline &s;alts, irritating and wounding
the nerves, produce na&s;cent pa&s;&s;ions and anxieties
in the &s;oul; which both aggravate di&s;tempers,
and render men's lives re&s;tle&s;s and wretched, even
when they are afflicted with no apparent di&s;tem|per.
This is the latent &s;pring of much woe,
&s;pleen, and taedium vitae. Small imperceptible
irritations of the minutest fibres or filaments cau|&s;ed
by the pungent &s;alts of wines and &s;auces, do
&s;o &s;hake and di&s;turb the microco&s;ms of high liv|ers,
as often to rai&s;e tempe&s;ts in courts and &s;enates.
Whereas the gentle vibrations that are rai&s;ed in
the nerves, by a fine &s;ubtile acid, &s;heathed in a
smooth volatile oil<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">59, 61.</NOTE>, &s;oftly &s;timulating and bra|cing
the nervous ve&s;&s;els and fibres, promotes a due
circulation and &s;ecretion of the animal juices, and
creates a calm &s;atisfied &s;en&s;e of health. And ac|cordingly
I have often known tar-water procure
&s;leep and compo&s;e the &s;pirits in cruel vigils, occa|&s;ioned
either by &s;ickne&s;s or by too inten&s;e applica|tion
of mind.</P>
<P>87. In di&s;ea&s;es &s;ometimes accidents happen from
without by mi&s;management, &s;ometimes latent cau|&s;es
operate within, jointly with the &s;pecific taint
or peculiar cau&s;e of the malady. The cau&s;es of
di&s;tempers are often complicated, and there may
be &s;omething in the idio&s;yncra&s;y of the patient
that puzzles the phy&s;ician. It may therefore be
pre&s;umed that no medicine is infallible, not even
in any one di&s;order. But as tar-water po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth
the virtues of fortifying the &s;tomach, as well as
purifying and invigorating the blood, beyond any
medicine that I know, it may be pre&s;umed of great
<PB N="42" REF="41">
and general efficacy in all tho&s;e numerous illne&s;&s;es,
which take their ri&s;e from &s;oul or vapid blood, or
from a bad dige&s;tion. The animal &s;pirits are ela|borated
from the blood. Such therefore as the
blood is, &s;uch will be the animal &s;pirit, more or
le&s;s, weaker or &s;tronger. This &s;heweth the u&s;e|fulness
of tar-water in all hysteric and hypocon|driac
ca&s;es; which together with the maladies
from indige&s;tion comprise almo&s;t the whole tribe
of chronical di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>88. The &s;curvy may be reckoned in the&s;e cli|mates
an univer&s;al malady, as people in general
are &s;ubject to it, and as it mixes more or le&s;s in
almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es. Whether this proceeds from
want of ela&s;ticity in our air, upon which the tone
of the ve&s;&s;els depends, and upon that the &s;everal
&s;ecretions: or whether it proceeds from the
moi&s;ture of our climate, or the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of our
food, or the &s;alts in our atmo&s;phere, or from all
the&s;e together; thus much at lea&s;t &s;eems not
ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that, as phy&s;icians in Spain and
Italy are apt to &s;u&s;pect the venereal taint to be a
latent principle, and bear a part in every illne&s;s,
&s;o for as good rea&s;on the &s;curvy &s;hould be con|&s;idered
by our phy&s;icians, as having &s;ome &s;hare
in mo&s;t di&s;orders and con&s;titutions that fall in their
way. It is certain our per&s;piration is not &s;o free
as in clearer air and warmer climates. Per&s;pirable
humours not di&s;charged will &s;tagnate and putrify.
A diet of animal food will be apt to render the
juices of our bodies alcale&s;cent. Hence ichorous
and corro&s;ive humours and many di&s;orders. Moi&s;t
air makes vi&s;cid blood; and &s;aline air inflames this
vi&s;cid blood. Hence broken capillaries, extrava|&s;ated
blood, &s;pots and ulcers, and other &s;$orbutic
&s;ymptoms. The body of a man attracts and im|bibes
the moi&s;ture and &s;alts of the air, and what|ever
<PB N="43" REF="42">
floats in the atmo&s;phere, which, as it is com|mon
to all, &s;o it affects all more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>89. Doctor Mu&s;grave thinks the Devon&s;hire
&s;curvy a relique of the lepro&s;y, and that it is not
owing to the qualities of the air. But as the&s;e in|&s;ulars
in general live in a gro&s;s &s;aline air, and their
ve&s;&s;els being le&s;s ela&s;tic, are con&s;equently le&s;s able
to &s;ubdue and ca&s;t off what their bodies as &s;pongees
draw in, one would be tempted to &s;u&s;pect the air
not a little concerned, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a &s;ituation
as that of Devon&s;hire. In all the&s;e Briti&s;h i&s;lands
we enjoy a great mediocrity of climate, the effect
whereof is, that we have neither heat enough to
exalt and di&s;&s;ipate the gro&s;s vapours, as in Italy,
nor cold enough to conden&s;e and precipitate them,
as in Sweden. So they are left floating in the air,
which we con&s;tantly breath, and imbibe through
the whole &s;urface of our bodies. And this toge|ther
with exhalations from coal fires, and the va|rious
fo&s;&s;ils wherein we abound, doth greatly con|tribute
to render us &s;corbutic and hypochondriac.</P>
<P>90. There are &s;ome who derive all di&s;ea&s;es from
the &s;curvy, which indeed mu&s;t be allowed to create
or mimic mo&s;t other maladies. Boerhaave tells us,
it produceth pleuretic, cholic, nephritic, hepatic
pains, various fevers, hot, malignant, intermitting,
dy&s;enteries, faintings, anxieties, drop&s;ies, con&s;ump|tions,
convul&s;ions, pal&s;ies, fluxes of blood. In a
word, it may be &s;aid to contain the &s;eeds and ori|gine
of almo&s;t all di&s;tempers. In&s;omuch that a
medicine which cures all &s;orts of &s;curvy, may be
pre&s;umed good for mo&s;t other maladies.</P>
<P>91. The &s;curvy doth not only in variety of
&s;ymptoms imitate mo&s;t di&s;tempers, but al&s;o when
come to a height, in degree of virulence equal the
mo&s;t malignant. Of this we have a remarkable
proof, in that horrible de&s;cription of the &s;corbutic
<PB N="44" REF="43">
patients in the ho&s;pitals of Paris, given by mon|&s;ieur
Poupart, in the Memoirs of the royal aca|demy
of &s;ciences, for the year one thou&s;and &s;ix
hundred and ninety-nine. That author thinks he
&s;aw &s;ome re&s;emblance in it to the plague of Athens.
It is hard to imagine any thing more dreadful than
the ca&s;e of tho&s;e men, rotting alive by the &s;curvy
in it's &s;upreme degree. To obviate &s;uch putre|faction,
I believe the mo&s;t effectual method would
be, to embalm (if one may &s;o &s;ay) the living bo|dy
with tar-water copiou&s;ly drunk; and this belief
is not without experience.</P>
<P>92. It is the received opinion that the animal
$word$ of a &s;ound body are of a neutral, bland and
benign nature: that is, the &s;alts in the juices pa&s;t
the primae viae are neither acid nor alcaline, hav|ing
been &s;ubdued by the con&s;titution, and changed
into a third nature. Where the con&s;titution wants
force to do this, the aliment is not duly a&s;&s;imila|ted;
and &s;o far as the &s;alts retain their pri&s;tine qua|lities,
&s;ickly &s;ymptoms en&s;ue, acids and alkalies not
perfectly &s;ubdued, producing weak ferments in the
juices. Hence &s;curvy, cachexy, and a long train
of ills.</P>
<P>93. A Cachexy or ill habit is much of the &s;ame
kind with the &s;curvy, proceeds from the &s;ame cau|&s;es
and is attended with like &s;ymptoms, which are
&s;o manifold and various, that the &s;curvy may well
be looked on as a general cachexy, infecting the
whole habit and vitiating all the dige&s;tions. Some
have reckoned as many &s;orts of the &s;curvy, as there
are different faints of the blood. Others have &s;up|po&s;ed
it a collection of all illne&s;&s;es together. Some
&s;uppo&s;e it an accumulation of &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es in
fieri. Others take it for an a&s;&s;emblage of the re+liques
of old di&s;tempers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">
94. But thus much is certain, the cure of the
&s;curvy is no more to be attempted by &s;trongly
active medicines than (to u&s;e the &s;imilitude of an
ingenious writer) a thorn in the fle&s;h, or pitch on
&s;ilk to be removed by force. The vi&s;cid humour
mu&s;t be gently re&s;olved and diluted, the tone of
the ve&s;&s;els recovered by a moderate &s;timulation,
and the tender fibres and capillary ve&s;&s;els gradually
cleared from the concreted &s;tuff, that adheres and
ob&s;tructs them. All which is in the apte&s;t manner
performed by a watery diluent, containing a fine
vegetable &s;oap. And although a compleat cure
by alteratives, operating on the &s;mall capillaries,
and by in&s;en&s;ible di&s;charges, mu&s;t require length
of time, yet the good effect of this medicine on
cachectic and &s;corbutic per&s;ons, is &s;oon perceived,
by the change it produceth in their pale di&s;colour|ed
looks, giving a florid healthy countenance in
le&s;s time then perhaps any other medicine.</P>
<P>25. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by phy&s;icians, that the imme|diate
cau&s;e of the &s;curvy lies in the blood, the
fibrous part of which is too thick and the &s;erum
too thin and &s;harp: and that hence ari&s;eth the
great difficulty in the cure, becau&s;e in the corre|cting
of one part, regard mu&s;t be had to the other.
It is well known how extremely difficult it is to
cure on inveterate &s;curvy: how many &s;corbutic
patients have grown wor&s;e by an injudicious cour&s;e
of evacuations: how many are even rendered in|curable
by the treatment of incon&s;iderate phy&s;i|cians:
and how difficult, tedious and uncertain the
cure is in the hands even of the be&s;t, who are
obliged to u&s;e &s;uch variety and change of medi|cines,
in the different &s;tages of that malady: which
neverthele&s;s may be cured (if I may judge by what
I have experienced) by the &s;ole, regular, con&s;tant,
copious u&s;e of Tar-water.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
96. Tar-water moderately in&s;pi&s;&s;ates with it's
bal&s;amic virtue, and renders mild the thin and
&s;harp part of the blood. The &s;ame, as a &s;oapy
medicine, di&s;&s;olves the grumous concretions of the
fibrous part. As a bal&s;am it de&s;troys the ulcerous
acrimony of the humours, and as a deob&s;truent it
opens and cleans the ve&s;&s;els, re&s;tores their tone,
and &s;trenghtens the dige&s;tion, who&s;e defects are the
principle cau&s;e of &s;curvy and cachexy.</P>
<P>97. In the cure of the &s;curvy, the principal aim
is to &s;ubdue the acrimony of the blood and juices.
But as this acrimony proceeds from different cau&s;es,
or even oppo&s;ite, as acid and alkaline, what is
good in one &s;ort of &s;curvy proves dangerous, or
even mortal, in another. It is well known, that
hot anti&s;corbutics, where the juices of the body
are alcale&s;cent, increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e. And &s;our
fruits and vegetables produce the like effect in the
&s;curvy, cau&s;ed by an acid acrimony. Hence fatal
blunders are committed by unwary practitioners,
who, not di&s;tingui&s;hing the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e,
do frequently aggravate, in&s;tead of curing it. If
I may tru&s;t what tryals I have been able to make,
this water is good in the &s;everal kinds of &s;curvy,
acid, alcaline, and muriatic, and I believe it the
only medicine that cures them all without doing
hurt in any. As it contains a volatile acid<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">7.</NOTE> with
a fine volatile oyl, why may not a medicine cool
in one part and warm in another be a remedy to
either extreme<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">72.</NOTE>? I have ob&s;erved it to produce
a kindly genial warmth without heat, a thing to
be aimed at in all &s;orts of &s;curvy. Be&s;ides the
bal&s;am in Tar-water &s;heaths all &s;corbutic &s;alts
alike: and its great virtues as a dige&s;ter and deob|&s;truent
<PB N="47" REF="46">
are of general u&s;e in all &s;corbutic, and I
may add in all chronical ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>98. I cannot be &s;ure that I have tried it in a &s;cro|phulous
ca&s;e, though I have tried it &s;uccesfully
in one that I &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o. And I appre|hend
it would be very &s;erviceable in &s;uch di&s;orders.
For although Doctor Gibbs in his treati&s;e of the
King's Evil derives that di&s;ea&s;e from a coagulat|ing
acid, which is al&s;o agreeable to the opinion
of &s;ome other phy&s;icians, and although Tar-water
contain an acid, yet as it is a &s;oap,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">58.</NOTE> it re&s;olves
in&s;tead of coagulating the juices of the body.</P>
<P>99. For hy&s;terical and hypocondriacal di&s;orders
&s;o frequent among us, it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed
that all acids are bad. But I will venture to ex|cept
the acid &s;oap of Tar-water, having found
by my own experience and that of many others,
that it rai&s;eth the &s;pirits, and is an excellent anti|hy&s;teric,
nor le&s;s innocent than potent, which
cannot be &s;aid of tho&s;e others in common u&s;e,
that often leave people wor&s;e than they found
them.</P>
<P>100. In a high degree of &s;curvy a mercurial &s;a|livation
is looked on by many as the only cure.
Which by the vehement choque it gives the
whole frame, and the &s;en&s;ible &s;ecretion it produceth
may be thought to be more adequate to &s;uch an
effect. But the di&s;order occa&s;ioned by that vio|lent
process, it is to be feared, may never be got
over. The immediate danger, the frequent bad
effects, the extreme trouble and nice care attend|ing
&s;uch a course do very de&s;ervedly make people
afraid of it. And though the &s;en&s;ible &s;ecretion
therein to be &s;o great, yet in a longer tract of
time the u&s;e of Tar-water may produce as great
<PB N="48" REF="47">
a di&s;charge of &s;corbutic &s;alts by urine and by per$|piration,
the effect of which la&s;t, though not &s;o
&s;en&s;ible, may yet be greater than that of &s;aliva|tion;
e&s;pecially if it be true, that in common life
in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is to nutrition, and all &s;en|&s;ible
excretions, as five to three.</P>
<P>101. Many hy&s;teric and &s;corbutic ailments,
many taints contracted by them&s;elves, or inherited
from their ance&s;tors, afflict the people of condition
in the&s;e islands, often rendering them, upon the
whole, much more unhappy than tho&s;e whom po|verty
and labour have ranked in the lowe&s;t lot of
life; which ailments may be &s;afely removed or re|lieved
by the &s;ole u&s;e of Tar-water; And tho&s;e lives
which &s;eem hardly worth living for bad appetite,
low &s;pirits, restle&s;s nights, wa&s;ting pains and an|xieties,
be rendered ea&s;y and comfortable.</P>
<P>102. As the nerves are in&s;truments of &s;en&s;ation,
if follows that &s;pa&s;ms in the nerves may produce
all &s;ymptoms, and therefore a di&s;order in the ner|vous
&s;y&s;tems &s;hall imitate all di&s;tempers, and occa|&s;ion,
in appearance, an a&s;thma for in&s;tance, a pleu|ri&s;y,
or a fit of the &s;tone. Now whatever is good
for the nerves in general, is good again&s;t all &s;uch
&s;ymptoms. But Tar-water, as it includes in an
eminent degree the virtues of warm gums and re|&s;ins,
is of great u&s;e for comforting and &s;trengthen|ing
the nerves,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">86.</NOTE> curing twitches in the nervous
fibres, cramps al&s;o, and numbne&s;s in the limbs, re|moving
anxieties and promoting &s;leep, in all which
ca&s;es I have known it very &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>103. This &s;afe and cheap medicine &s;uits all cir|cum&s;tances
and all con&s;titutions, operating ea&s;ily,
$uring without di&s;turbing, rai&s;ing the &s;pirits wit|hout
depre&s;&s;ing them, a circum&s;tance that de&s;erves
<PB N="49" REF="48">
repeated attention, e&s;pecially in the&s;e climates,
where &s;trong liquors &s;o fatally and &s;o frequently pro|duce
tho&s;e very di&s;tre&s;&s;es they are de&s;igned to re|medy;
and, if I am not mi&s;informed, even among
the Ladies them&s;elves, who are truly much to be
pitied. Their condition of life makes them a prey
to imaginary woes, which never fail to grow up
in minds unexerci&s;ed and unemployed. To get
rid of the&s;e, it is &s;aid, there are who betake them|&s;elves
to di&s;tilled &s;pirits. And it is not improbable,
they are led gradually to the u&s;e of tho&s;e poi&s;ons
by a certain complai&s;ant pharmacy, too much u&s;ed
in the modern practice, pal&s;y drops, poppy cordial,
plague water, and &s;uch like, which being in truth
nothing but drams di&s;gui&s;ed, yet coming from the
apothecaries, are con&s;idered only as medicines.</P>
<P>104. The &s;oul of man was &s;uppo&s;ed by many
ancient &s;ages, to be thru&s;t into the human body as
into a pri&s;on, for puni&s;hment of pa&s;t offences. But
the wor&s;t pri&s;on is the body of an indolent Epi|cure,
who&s;e blood is inflamed by fermented liquors
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> and high &s;auces, or render'd putrid,
&s;harp, and corro&s;ive, by a &s;tagnation of the animal
juices through &s;loth and indolence; who&s;e mem|branes
are irritated by pungent &s;alts, who&s;e mind
is agitated by painful o&s;cillations of the
nervous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">86.</NOTE> &s;y&s;tem, and who&s;e nerves are mutually
affected by the irregular pa&s;&s;ions of his mind. This
ferment in the animal o$conomy darkens and con|founds
the intellect. It produceth vain terrours
and vain conceits, and &s;timulates the &s;oul with mad
de&s;ires, which, not being natural, nothing in na|ture
can &s;atisfy. No wonder, therefore, there are
&s;o many fine per&s;ons of both &s;exes, &s;hining them|&s;elves,
and &s;hone on by fortune, who are inwardly
mi&s;erable and &s;ick of life.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49">
105. The hardne&s;s of &s;tubbed vulgar con&s;titu|tions,
renders them in&s;en&s;ible of a thou&s;and things,
that fret and gall tho&s;e delicate people, who, as
if their &s;kin was peeled off, feel to the quick every
thing that touches them. The remedy for this ex|qui&s;ite
and painful &s;en&s;ibility is commonly &s;ought
from fermented, perhaps from di&s;tilled, liquors,
which render many lives wretched, that would
otherwi&s;e have been only ridiculous. The tender ner|ves,
and low &s;pirits of &s;uch poor creatures, would
be much relieved by the u&s;e of Tar-water, which
might prolong and cheer their lives. I do there|fore
recommend to them the u&s;e of a cordial, not
only &s;afe and innocent, but giving health and &s;pirit
as &s;urely as other cordials de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>106. I do verily think, there is not any other
medicine what&s;oever, &s;o effectual to re&s;tore a crazy
con&s;titution, and cheer a dreary mind, or &s;o likely
to &s;ubvert that gloomy empire of the &s;pleen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE>
which tyrani&s;eth over the better &s;ort (as they are
called) of the&s;e free nations; and maketh them,
in &s;pight of their liberty and property, more wretch|ed
&s;laves than even the &s;ubjects of ab&s;olute power,
who breath clear air in a &s;unny climate. While
men of low degree often enjoy a tranquillity and con|tent,
that no advantage of birth or fortune can
equal. Such, indeed, was the ca&s;e, while the rich
alone could afford to be debauched; but when even
beggars became debauchees, the ca&s;e was altered.</P>
<P>107. The public virtue and &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h
legi&s;lature, never &s;hewed it&s;elf more con&s;picuous
in any act, than in that for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the
immoderate u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquours among the
people, who&s;e &s;trength and numbers con&s;titute
<PB N="51" REF="50">
the true wealth of a nation: though eva&s;ive arts
will, it is feared, prevail &s;o long as di&s;tilled &s;pirits
of any kind are allowed, the character of Engli&s;h|men
in general, being that of Brutus, Quicquid
vult valde vult. But why &s;hould &s;uch a canker be
tolerated in the vitals of a &s;tate, under any pre|tence
or in any &s;hape what&s;oever? Better by far,
the whole pre&s;ent &s;et of di&s;tillers were pen&s;ioners
of the public, and their trade aboli&s;hed by law;
&s;ince all the benefit thereof put together would not
balance the hundredth part of its mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>108. To prove the de&s;tructive effects of &s;uch
&s;pirits with regard both to the humane &s;pecies and
individuals, we need not go &s;o far as our colonies,
or the &s;avage natives of America. Plain proof
may be had nearer home. For, albeit there is in
every town or di&s;trict throughout England, &s;ome
tough dram-drinker, &s;et up as the Devil's decoy,
to draw in pro&s;elytes; yet the ruined health and
morals, and the beggary of &s;uch numbers evident|ly
&s;hew that we need no other enemy to compleat
our de&s;truction, than this cheap luxury at the lower
end of the &s;tate, and that a nation lighted up at
both ends mu&s;t &s;oon be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>109. It is much to be lamented that our In&s;u|lars,
who act and think &s;o much for them&s;elves,
&s;hould yet from gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of air and diet, grow
&s;tupid or doat &s;ooner than other people, who by
virtue of ela&s;tic air, water-drinking, and light
food, pre&s;erve their faculties to extreme old age;
an advantage which may perhaps be approached,
if not equalled, even in the&s;e regions, by tar-water,
temperance, and early hours; the la&s;t is a
&s;ure addition to life, not only in regard of time,
which, being taken from &s;leep, the image of
death, is added to the waking hours, but al&s;o in
regard of longevity and duration in the vulgar
<PB N="52" REF="51">
&s;en&s;e. I may &s;ay too, in regard of &s;pirit and viva|city,
which, within the &s;ame compa&s;s of duration,
may, truly and properly be affirmed to add to
man's life: it being manife&s;t, that one man,
by a bri&s;ker motion of his &s;pirits and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
his ideas, &s;hall live more in one hour, than ano|ther
in two: and that the quantity of life is to be
e&s;timated, not merely from the duration, but al&s;o
from the inten&s;ene&s;s of living. Which inten&s;e
living, or, it I may &s;o &s;ay, lively life, is not
more promoted by early hours as a regimen, than
by tar-water as a cordial; which acts, not only as
a &s;low medicine, but hath al&s;o an immediate and
cheerful<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">66.</NOTE> effects on the &s;pirits.</P>
<P>110. It mu&s;t be owned, the light attracted &s;e|creted
and detained in tar,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">8, 29, 40.</NOTE> and afterwards
drawn off in its fine&s;t bal&s;amic particle, by the gentle
men&s;truum of cold water, is not a violent and &s;ud|den
medicine, always to produce its effect an once,
(&s;uch by irritating, often do more mi&s;chief than
good) but a &s;afe and mild alterative, which pene|trates
the whole &s;y&s;tem, opens, heals, and &s;trength|ens
the remote ve&s;&s;els, alters and propels their con|tents,
and enters the minute&s;t capillaries, and can|not
therefore, otherwi&s;e, than by degree and in
time work a radical cure of chronic di&s;tempers.
It gives neverthele&s;s &s;peedy relief in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as
I have found by my &s;elf and many others. I
have been &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee per&s;on fallen away and
langui&s;hing under a bad dige&s;tion, after a few
weeks recover a good &s;tomach, and with it fle&s;h and
&s;trength, &s;o as to &s;eem renewed, by the drinking
of tar-water. The &s;trength and quantity of this
water to be taken by each individual per&s;on is be&s;t
determined from experience. And as for the time
<PB N="53" REF="52">
of taking, I never knew any evil en&s;ue from its
being continued ever &s;o long; but, on the con|trary,
many and great advantages, which &s;ome|times
would not perhaps begin to &s;hew them&s;elves
till it had been taken two or three months.</P>
<P>111. We learn from Pliny, that in the fir&s;t fer|ment
of new wine or mu&s;tum, the ancients were
wont to &s;prinkle it with powdered ro&s;in, which
gave it a certain &s;prightline&s;s, quaedam &s;aporis acu|mina.
This was e&s;teemed a great improver of its
odour and ta&s;te, and was, I doubt not, of its fa|lubrity
al&s;o. The brown old ro&s;in, that it to &s;ay,
harden'd tar, as being more ea&s;ily pulverized and
&s;ifted, was mo&s;t in reque&s;t for this purpo&s;e. They
u&s;ed likewi&s;e of &s;ea&s;on their wine-ve&s;&s;els with pitch
or ro&s;in. And I make no doubt, that if our vint|ners
would contrive to medicate their wines with
the &s;ame ingredients, they might improve and
pre&s;erve them, with le&s;s trouble and expence to
them&s;elves, and le&s;s danger to others. He that
would know more particulars of this matter may
con&s;ult Pliny and Columella. I &s;hall only add,
that I doubt not a &s;imilar improvement may be
made of malt liquor.</P>
<P>112. The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Theophra&s;tus and re&s;ina of
Pliny are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a general &s;en&s;e, to
&s;ignify all &s;orts of oily vi&s;cid ex&s;udations from
plants or trees. The crude watery juice, that ri|&s;eth
early in the &s;pring, is gradually ripened and
in&s;pi&s;&s;ated by the &s;olar heat, becoming in orderly
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion with the sea&s;ons an oil, a bal&s;am, and at
la&s;t a re&s;in. And it is ob&s;erved by chemi&s;ts, that
turpentine di&s;&s;olved over a gentle fire, is, by the
con&s;tant operation of heat, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively transform|ed
into oil, bal&s;am, pitch, and hard friable re&s;in,
which will incorporate with oil or rectified &s;pirit,
but not with water.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">
113. Sir John Floyer remarks, that we want a
method for the u&s;e of turpentine, and again, he
who &s;hall hit, &s;aith he, on the plea&s;ante&s;t method
of giving turpentine, will do great cures in the gout,
&s;tone, catarrhs, drop&s;ies and cold &s;curvies, rheu|mati&s;ms,
ulcers, and ob&s;tructions of the glands.
La&s;tly, he &s;ubjoins, that for the u&s;e of altering and
amending the juices and fibres, it mu&s;t be given
frequently, and in &s;uch &s;mall quantities at a time,
and in &s;o commodious a manner, as will agree be&s;t
with the &s;tomach<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">9.</NOTE> &s;tay longe&s;t in the body, and
not purge it&s;elf off; for large do&s;es (&s;aith he) go
through too quick, and be&s;ides offend the head.
Now the infu&s;ion of tar or turpentine in cold wa|ter
&s;eems to &s;upply the very method that was
wanted, as it leaves the more unctuous, and gro&s;s
parts behind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">47.</NOTE> which might offend the &s;tomach,
inte&s;tines and head; and as it may be ea&s;ily taken,
and as often, and in &s;uch quantity and &s;uch degree
of &s;trength, as &s;uits the ca&s;e of the patient. Nor
&s;hould it &s;eem, that the fine &s;pirit and volatile oil,
obtained by infu&s;ion of tar<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">7, 42, 58.</NOTE> is inferior to that
of turpentine, to which it &s;upperadds the virtue
of wood &s;oot, which is known to be very great
with re&s;pect to the head and nerves; and this ap|pears
evident from the manner of obtaining tar
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">13.</NOTE>. And as the fine volatile parts of tar or tur|pentine
are obtained by infu&s;ion in cold water and
ea&s;ily conveyed throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem of
the human body; &s;o it &s;hould &s;eem the &s;ame me|thod
may be u&s;ed with all &s;orts of bal&s;ams or re&s;ins
what&s;oever, as the readie&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, and mo&s;t in|offen&s;ive,
as well as in many ca&s;es the mo&s;t effectual
way of obtaining and imparting their virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">
114. After having &s;aid &s;o much of the u&s;es of
tar, I mu&s;t farther add, that being rubb'd on them
it is an excellent pre&s;ervative of the teeth and gums:
and that it clears and &s;trengthens the voice. And,
as its effects are various and u&s;eful, &s;o there is no|thing
to be feared from the operation of an altera|tive
&s;o mild and friendly to nature. It was a wi&s;e
maxim of certain ancient philo&s;ophers, that di&s;|ea&s;es
ought not to be irritated by medicines. But
no medicine di&s;turbs the animal oeconomy le&s;s than
this, which, if I may tru&s;t my own experience,
never produces any di&s;order in a patient when
rightly taken.</P>
<P>115. I knew indeed a per&s;on who took a large
gla&s;s of tar-water ju&s;t before breakfa&s;t, which gave
him an invincible nau&s;ea and di&s;gu&s;t, although he
had before received the greate&s;t benefit from it.
But if the tar-water be taken and made in the man|ner
pre&s;cribed at the beginning of this e&s;&s;ay, it will,
if I mi&s;take not, have enough of the &s;alt to be u&s;e|ful,
and little enough of the oil to be inoffen&s;ive.
Per&s;ons more delicate than ordinary may render it
palatable, by mixing a drop of the chemical oil of
nutmegs, or a &s;poonful of mountain wine in each
gla&s;s. It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that I have
known &s;ome, who&s;e nice &s;tomachs could not bear
it in the morning, take it at night going to bed
without any inconvenience; and that with &s;ome it
agrees be&s;t warm, with others cold.</P>
<P>116. In very dangerous and acute ca&s;es much
may be taken and often; as far as the &s;tomach can
bear. But in chronical ca&s;es, about half a pint,
night and morning, may &s;uffice. A medicine of &s;o
great virtue in &s;o many different di&s;orders, and
e&s;pecially in that grand enemy, the fever, mu&s;t
needs be a benefit to mankind in general&punc;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE> There are
<PB N="56" REF="55">
neverthele&s;s three &s;orts of people to whom I would
peculiarly recommend it: Sea-faring per&s;ons, la|dies,
and men of &s;tudious and &s;edentary lives.</P>
<P>117. To &s;ailors and all &s;ea-faring per&s;ons, who
are &s;ubject to &s;corbutic di&s;orders and putrid fevers,
e&s;pecially in long &s;outhern voyages, I am per&s;ua|ded
this tar-water would be very beneficial. And
this may de&s;erve particular notice in the pre&s;ent
cour&s;e of marine expeditions, when &s;o many of our
country-men have peri&s;hed by &s;uch di&s;tempers,
contracted at &s;ea and in foreign climates. Which,
it is probable, might have been prevented, by the
copious u&s;e of tar-water.</P>
<P>118. This &s;ame water will al&s;o give charitable
relief to the ladies,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">103.</NOTE> who often want it more
than the pari&s;h poor; being many of them never
able to make a good meal, and &s;itting pale, puny,
and forbidden like gho&s;ts, at their own table, vic|tims
of vapours and indige&s;tion.</P>
<P>119. Studious per&s;ons al&s;o pent up in narrow
holes, breathing bad air, and &s;tooping over their
books, are much to be pitied. As they are debar|red
the free u&s;e of air and exerci&s;e, this I will ven|ture
to recommend as the be&s;t &s;uccedaneum to both.
Though it were to be wi&s;hed, that modern &s;cholars
would, like the ancients, meditate and conver&s;e
more in walks and gardens and open air, which,
upon the whole, would perhaps be no hindrance to
their learning, and a great advantage to their
health. My own &s;edentary cour&s;e of life had long
&s;ince thrown me into an ill habit, attended with ma|ny
ailments particularly a nervous cholic, which
rendered my life a burthen, and the more &s;o, be|cau&s;e
my pains were exa&s;perated by exerci&s;e. But
<PB N="57" REF="56">
&s;ince the u&s;e of tar water, I find, though not a per|fect
recovery from my old and rooted illne&s;s, yet
&s;uch a gradual return of health and ea&s;e, that I
e&s;teem my having taken this medicine the greate&s;t
of all temporal ble&s;&s;ings, and am convinced that,
under providence, I owe my life to it.</P>
<P>120. In the di&s;tilling of turpentine and other
bal&s;ams by a gentle heat, it hath been ob&s;erved,
that there ri&s;eth fir&s;t an acid &s;pirit<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">7.</NOTE> that will
mix with water; which &s;pirit, except the fire be
very gentle, is lo&s;t. This grateful acid &s;pirit
that fir&s;t comes over, is, as a learned chymi&s;t
and phy&s;ician informs us, highly refrigeratory,
diuretic, &s;udorific, bal&s;amic or pre&s;ervative from
putrefaction, excellent in nephritic ca&s;es, and for
quenching thir&s;t, all which virtues are contained
in the cold infu&s;ion, which draws forth from&punc; tar
only it's fine flower or quinte&s;&s;ence, if I may &s;o
&s;ay, or the native vegetable &s;pirit, together with a
little volatile oil.</P>
<P>121. The di&s;tingui&s;hing principle of all vege|tables,
that whereon their peculiar &s;mell, ta&s;te,
and &s;pecific properties depend, &s;eems to be &s;ome
extremely fine and &s;ubtile &s;pirit, who&s;e immedi|ate
vehicle is an exceeding thin volatile oil, which
is it &s;elf detained in a gro&s;&s;er and more vi&s;cid re|&s;in
or bal&s;am, lodged in proper cells in the bark
and &s;eeds, and mo&s;t abounding in autumn or win|ter,
after the crude juices have been thoroughly
concocted, ripened, and impregnated with &s;olar
light. The &s;pirit it &s;elf is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to
be an oil highly &s;ubtilized, &s;o as to mix with
water. But &s;uch volatile oil is not the &s;pirit,
but only it's vehicle. Since a$omatic oils, be|ing
long expo&s;ed to air, will lo&s;e their &s;pecific
&s;mell and ta&s;te, which $ly off with the &s;pirit or
<PB N="58" REF="57">
vegetable &s;alt, without any &s;en&s;ible diminution of
the oil.</P>
<P>122. Tho&s;e volatile &s;alts, that are &s;et free and
rai&s;ed by a gentle heat, may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed
e&s;&s;ential<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">8.</NOTE>, and to have pre-exi&s;ted in the ve|getable;
whereas the lixivial fixed &s;alts obtained
by the incineration of the &s;ubject, who&s;e natural
con&s;tituent parts have been altered or de&s;troyed by
the extreme force of fire, are by later chymi&s;ts,
upon very good grounds, &s;uppo&s;ed not to have
pre-exi&s;ted therein; all &s;uch &s;alts appearing, from
the experiments of &s;ignor Redi, not to pre&s;erve
the virtues of the re&s;pective vegetable &s;ubjects;
and to be alike purgative and in an equal de|gree,
what&s;oever may be the &s;hape of their points,
whether &s;harp or obtu&s;e. But although fixed or
lixivious &s;alts may not contain the original pro|perties
of the &s;ubject; yet volatile &s;alts rai&s;ed by a
&s;light heat from vegetables are allowed to pre&s;erve
their native virtues: and &s;uch &s;alts are readily im|bibed
by water.</P>
<P>123. The mo&s;t volatile of the &s;alts, and the
mo&s;t attenuated part of the oil, may be &s;uppo&s;ed
the fir&s;t and readie&s;t to impregnate a cold in$u|$ion
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1, 7.</NOTE>. And this will a&s;&s;i&s;t us to account for
the virtues of tar water. That volatile acid in
vegetables, which re&s;i&s;ts putrefaction, and is their
great pre&s;ervative, is detained in a &s;ubtile oil mi&s;|cible
with water, which oil is it &s;elf impri&s;oned in
the re&s;in or gro&s;&s;er part of the tar, from which it
is ea&s;ily &s;et free and obtained pure by cold wa|ter.</P>
<P>124. The mild native acids are ob&s;erved more
kindly to work upon, and more thoroughly to
di&s;&s;olve, metallic bodies, than the &s;tronge&s;t acid
&s;pirits produced by a vehement fire; and it may

be &s;u&s;pected, they have the &s;ame advantage as a
medicine. And as no acid, by the ob&s;ervation
of &s;ome of the be&s;t chymi&s;ts, can be obtained
from the &s;ub&s;tance of animals thoroughly a&s;&s;imi|lated,
it &s;hould follow, that the acids received
into a healthy body mu&s;t be quite &s;ubdued and
changed by the vital powers: but it is ea&s;ier to &s;ub|due
and a&s;&s;imilate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">48.</NOTE> the gentler than the &s;tronger
acids.</P>
<P>125. I am very &s;en&s;ible, that on &s;uch &s;ubjects
arguments fall &s;hort of evidence: and that mine
fall &s;hort even of what they might have been if I
enjoyed better health, or tho&s;e opportunities of a
learned commerce, from which I am cut off in
this remote corner. I &s;hall neverthele&s;s go on as
I have begun, and proceed by rea&s;on, by con|jecture,
and by authority, to ca&s;t the be&s;t light
I can on the ob&s;cure paths that lie in my way.</P>
<P>126. Sir I&s;aac Newton, Boerhaave, and Hom|berg
are all agreed, that the acid is a fine &s;ubtile
&s;ub&s;tance, pervading the whole terraqueous globe;
which produceth divers kinds of bodies, as it is
united to different &s;ubjects. This according to
Homberg is the pure &s;alt, &s;alt the principle, in it
&s;elf &s;imilar and uniform, but never found alone.
And although this principle be called the &s;alt of
the earth, yet it &s;hould &s;eem it may more pro|perly
be called the &s;alt of the air, &s;ince earth
turned up and lying fallow receives it from the
air. And it &s;hould &s;eem that this is the great
principle of vegetation, derived into the earth
from all &s;orts of manures, as well as from the
air. The acid is allowed to be the cau&s;e of fer|mentation
in all fermented liquors. Why there|fore,
may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed to ferment the earth,
<PB N="60" REF="59">
and to con&s;titute that fine penetrating principle,
which introduces and a&s;&s;imilates the food of plants,
and is &s;o fugitive as to e&s;cape all the filtrations
and perqui&s;itions of the mo&s;t nice ob&s;ervers?</P>
<P>127. It is the doctrine of Sir I&s;aac Newton
and mon&s;ieur Homberg, that, as the watery acid
is that which renders &s;alt &s;oluble in water, &s;o it is
that &s;ame which joined to the earthy part makes it
a &s;alt. Let it therefore be con&s;idered, that the
organs<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">30, 31, 35.</NOTE> of plants are tubes, the filling, un|folding,
and di&s;tending whereof by liquors, doth
con&s;titute what is called the vegetation or growth
of the plant. But earth it &s;elf is not &s;oluble in
water, &s;o as to form one vegetable fluid there|with.
Therefore the particles of earth mu&s;t be
joined with a watery acid, that is, they mu&s;t be|come
&s;alts in order to di&s;&s;olve in water; that &s;o,
in the form of a vegetable juice, they may pa&s;s
through the &s;trainers and tubes of the root into
the body of the plant, &s;welling and di&s;tending
it's parts and organs, that is, increa&s;ing it's bulk.
Therefore the vegetable matter of the earth is in
effect earth changed into &s;alt. And to render earth
fertile, is to cau&s;e many of it's particles to a&s;&s;ume a
&s;aline form.</P>
<P>128. Hence it is ob&s;erved, there are more
&s;alts in the root than in the bark, more &s;alts in
vegetables during the &s;pring, than in the autumn
or winter, the crude &s;aline juices being in the
&s;ummer months partly evaporated, and partly ri|pened
by the action and mixture of light. Hence
al&s;o it appears, why the dividing of earth, &s;o as
to enlarge it's &s;urface, whereby it may admit
more acid from the air, is of &s;uch u&s;e in pro|moting
vegetation. And why a&s;hes, lime, and
<PB N="61" REF="60">
burnt clay are found &s;o profitable manures, fire
being in reality the acid, as is proved in the &s;e|quel
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">202.</NOTE>. Marls al&s;o and &s;hells are u&s;eful, fora&s;|much
as tho&s;e alcaline bodies attract the acid, and
rai&s;e an efferve&s;cence with it, thereby promoting
a fermentation in the glebe. The excrements of
animals and putrid vegetables do in like manner
contribute to vegetation, by increa&s;ing the &s;alts of
the earth. And where fallows are well broken,
and lye long to receive the acid of the air into all
their parts; this alone will be &s;ufficient to change
many terrene particles into &s;alts, and con&s;equently
render them &s;oluble in water, and therefore fit ali|ment
for vegetables.</P>
<P>129. The acid, &s;aith Homberg, is always join|ed
to &s;ome &s;ulphur, which determines it to this or
that &s;pecies, producing different &s;alts, as it is the
vegetable, bituminous, or metallique &s;ulphur. E|ven
the alcaline, whether volatile or lixivial &s;alts,
are &s;uppo&s;ed to be nothing but this &s;ame acid
&s;trictly detained by oil and earth, in &s;pight of
the extreme force of fire, which lodgeth in them,
without being able to di&s;lodge &s;ome remains of the
acid.</P>
<P>130. Salts, according to &s;ir Isaac Newton, are
dry earth and watery acid united by attraction,
the acid rendering them &s;oluble in water<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">127.</NOTE>. He
&s;uppo&s;eth the watery acid to flow round the ter|re&s;trial
part, as the ocean doth round the earth,
being attracted thereby, and compares each par|ticle
of &s;alt, to a chaos whereof the innermo&s;t
part is hard and earthy, but the &s;urface &s;oft and
watery. Whatever attracts and is attracted mo&s;t
&s;trongly is an acid in his &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61">
131. It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to determine the figures
of particular &s;alts. All acid &s;olvents together with
the di&s;&s;olved bodies are apt to &s;hoot into certain
figures. And the figures, in which the fo&s;&s;il &s;alts
cry&s;tallize, have been &s;uppo&s;ed the proper natural
&s;hapes of them and their acids. But Homberg
hath clearly &s;hewed the contrary: fora&s;much as the
&s;ame acid di&s;&s;olving different bodies, a&s;&s;umes dif|ferent
&s;hapes. Spirit of nitre, for in&s;tance, hav|ing
di&s;&s;olved copper, &s;hoots into hexagonal cry&s;tals;
the &s;ame having di&s;&s;olved iron, &s;hoots into irregu|lar
&s;quares; and again, having di&s;&s;olved &s;ilver,
forms thin cry&s;tals of a triangular figure.</P>
<P>132. Homberg neverthele&s;s holds in general,
that acids are &s;haped like daggers, and alcalies like
&s;heaths: and that moving in the &s;ame $iquor, the
daggers run into the &s;heaths fitted to receive them,
with &s;uch violence as to rai&s;e that efferve&s;cence ob|&s;erved
in the mixture of acids and alcalies. But it
&s;eems very difficult to conceive, how, or why the
mere configuration of daggers and &s;heaths, floating
in the &s;ame liquor, &s;hould cau&s;e the former to ru&s;h
with &s;uch vehemence, and direct their points &s;o
aptly into the latter, any more than a parcel of &s;pi|gots
and fo&s;&s;ets floating together in the &s;ame water,
&s;hould ru&s;h one into the other.</P>
<P>133. It &s;hould &s;eem rather, that the vehement
attraction which Sir I&s;aac Newton attributes to all
acids, whereby he &s;uppo&s;eth them to ru&s;h towards,
penetrate, &s;hake, and divide the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies,
and to ferment the liquid of vegetables, could bet|ter
account for this phaenomenon. It is in this at|traction,
that Sir I&s;aac placeth all their activity,
and indeed it &s;hould &s;eem, the figures of &s;alts were
not of &s;uch e$$icacy in producing their effects, as
the &s;trong attractive powers whereby they are
<PB N="63" REF="62">
agitated and do agitate other bodies. E&s;pecially if
it be true (what was before remarked) that lixivious
&s;alts are alike purgative, whatever may be the
&s;hape of their angles, whether more or le&s;s acute or
obtu&s;e.</P>
<P>134. Sir I&s;aac Newton accounts for the watery
acid's making earthy corpu&s;cles &s;oluble in water, by
&s;uppo&s;ing the acid to be a mean between earth
and water, it's particles greater than tho&s;e of wa|ter,
and le&s;s than tho&s;e of earth, and &s;trongly to
attract both. But perhaps there is no nece&s;&s;ary
rea&s;on, for &s;uppo&s;ing the parts of the acid gro&s;&s;er
than the parts of water, in order to produce this
effect; may not this as well be accounted for, by
giving them only a &s;trong attraction or cohe&s;ion
with the bodies to which they are joined?</P>
<P>135. The acid &s;pirit or &s;alt, that mighty in&s;tru|ment
in the hand of nature, re&s;iding in the air, and
diffu&s;ed throughout that whole element, is di&s;cer|nible
al&s;o in many parts of the earth, particularly in
fo&s;&s;ils, &s;uch as &s;ulphur, vitriol, and alum; it was
already ob&s;erved from Homberg, that this acid is
never found pure, but hath always &s;ulphur joined
with it, and is cla&s;&s;ed by the difference of it's &s;ul|phurs,
whether mineral, vegetable, or animal.</P>
<P>136. Salts are vulgarly reckoned the mo&s;t active
of chymical principles. But Homberg derives all
their activity from the &s;ulphurs joined with them.
From which al&s;o, as hath been &s;aid, he derives all
their kinds and differences,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">129.</NOTE> Salt, water, oil,
and earth &s;eem to be originally the &s;ame in all ve|getables.
All the difference, according to the
chymi&s;ts, ari&s;eth from a &s;pirit re&s;iding in the oil,
called the Rector or Archaeus. This is otherwi&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="63">
called by chymi&s;ts, ens primum, or the native &s;pi|rit,
whereon depend, and wherein are contained,
the peculiar flavour and odour, the &s;pecific qualities
and virtues of the plant.</P>
<P>137. The&s;e native &s;pirits or vegetable &s;ouls are
all breathed or exhaled into the air, which &s;eems
the receptacle as well as &s;ource of all &s;ublunary
forms, the great ma&s;s or chaos which imparts and
receives them. The air, or atmo&s;phere, that &s;ur|rounds
our earth, contains a mixture of all the ac|tive
volatile parts of the whole habitable world,
that is of all vegetables, minerals and animals.
Whatever per&s;pires, corrupts, or exhales impreg|nates
the air; which, being acted upon by the &s;o|lar
fire, produceth within it&s;elf all &s;orts of chy|mical
operations, di&s;pen&s;ing again tho&s;e &s;alts and
&s;pirits in new generations, which it had received
from putrefactions.</P>
<P>138. The perpetual o&s;cillations of this ela&s;tic and
re&s;tle&s;s element operate without cea&s;ing, on all
things that have life, whether animal or vegetable,
keeping their fibres, ve&s;&s;els, and fluids in a mo|tion
always changing; as heat, cold, moi&s;ture, dry|ne&s;s,
and other cau&s;es alter the ela&s;ticity of the air.
Which accounts, it mu&s;t be owned, for many ef|fects.
But there are many more which mu&s;t be de|rived
from other principles or qualities in the air.
Thus iron and copper are corroded and gather ru&s;t
in the air, and bodies of all &s;orts are di&s;&s;olved or
corrupted, which &s;heweth an acid to abound and
diffu&s;e it&s;elf throughout the air.</P>
<P>139. By this &s;ame air fire is kindled, the lamp
of life pre&s;erved, re&s;piration, dige&s;tion, nutrition,
the pul&s;e of the heart and motion of all the mu&s;|cles
&s;eem to be performed. Air therefore is a ge|neral
agent, not only exerting it's own, but calling
<PB N="65" REF="64">
forth the qualities or powers of all other bodies, by
a divi&s;ion, comminution, and agitation of their
particles, cau&s;ing them to fly off and become vo|latile
and active.</P>
<P>140. Nothing ferments, vegetates, or putrefies
without air, which operates with all the virtues of
the bodies included in it; that is, of all nature;
there being no drug, &s;alutary or poi&s;onous, who&s;e
virtues are not breathed into the air. The air there|fore
is an active ma&s;s of numberle&s;s different prin|ciples,
the general &s;ource of corruption and gene|ration;
on one hand dividing, abrading, and car|rying
off the particles of bodies, that is, corrupt|ing
or di&s;&s;olving them; on the other, producing
new ones into being; de&s;troying and be&s;towing
forms without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>141. The &s;eeds of things &s;eem to lye latent in
the air, ready to appear and produce their kind,
whenever they light on a proper matrix. The ex|tremely
&s;mall &s;eeds of fern, mo&s;&s;es, mu&s;hrooms,
and &s;ome other plants are concealed and wafted a|bout
in the air, every part whereof &s;eems replete
with &s;eeds of one kind or other. The whole at|mo&s;phere
&s;eems alive. There is every where acid
to corrode, and &s;eed to engender. Iron will ru&s;t,
and mold will grow in all places. Virgin earth be|comes
fertile, crops of new plants ever and anon
&s;hew them&s;elves, all which demon&s;trates the air to
be a common &s;eminary and receptacle of all vivi|$ying
principles.</P>
<P>142. Air may al&s;o be &s;aid to be the &s;eminary of
minerals and metals, as it is of vegetables. Mr.
Boyle informs us, that the exhau&s;ted ores of tin
and iron being expo&s;ed to the air become again im|pregnated
with metal, and that ore of alum having
lo&s;t it's &s;alt recovers it after the &s;ame manner.
<PB N="66" REF="65">
The like is related of &s;ilver and iron ores. And
numberle&s;s in&s;tances there are of &s;alts produced by
the air, that va&s;t collection or trea&s;ury of active
principles, from which all &s;ublunary bodies &s;eem to
derive their forms, and on which animals depend
for their life and breath.</P>
<P>143. That there is &s;ome latent vivifying &s;pirit
di&s;per&s;ed throughout the air common experience
&s;heweth; ina$much as it is nece&s;&s;ary both to vege|tables
and animals<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">138, 139.</NOTE> whether terre&s;trial or aquatic,
neither bea&s;ts, in&s;ects, birds nor fi&s;hes being able
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without air. Nor doth all air &s;uffice,
there being &s;ome quality or ingredient, of which
when air is deprived, it becometh unfit to main|tain
either life or flame. And this even though the
air &s;hould retain it's ela&s;ticity; which, by the bye,
is an argument that air doth not act only as an an|tagoni&s;t
to the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles. It hath both
that and many other u&s;es. It gives and pre&s;erves a
proper tone to the ve&s;&s;els: this ela&s;tic fluid pro|motes
all &s;ecretions: it's o&s;cillations keep every part
in motion: it pervades and actuates the whole ani|mal
&s;y&s;tem, producing great variety of effects, and
even oppo&s;ite in different parts, cooling at the &s;ame
time and heating, di&s;tending and contracting, co|agulating
and re&s;olving, giving and taking, &s;u&s;|taining
life and impairing it, pre&s;&s;ing without and
expanding within, abrading &s;ome parts, at the
&s;ame time in&s;inuating and &s;upplying others, pro|ducing
various vibrations in the fibres, and fer|ments
in the fluids; all which mu&s;t needs en&s;ue
from &s;uch a &s;ubtile, active, heterogeneous and ela&s;tic
fluid.</P>
<P>144. But there is, as was before ob&s;erved, &s;ome
one quality or ingredient in the air, on which life
<PB N="67" REF="66">
more immediately and principally depends. What
that is, though Men are not agreed, yet it is agreed
it mu&s;t be the &s;ame thing that &s;upports the vital
and the common flame; it being found that when
air, by often breathing in it, is become unfit for
the one, it will no longer &s;erve for the other. The
like is ob&s;ervable in poi&s;onous damps or &s;teams,
wherein flame cannot be kindled. As is evident in
the Grotto del cane near Naples. And here it oc|curs,
to recommend the plunging them into cold
water, as an experiment to be tried on per&s;ons af|fected
by breathing a poi&s;onous vapour in old
vaults, mines, deep holes or cavities under ground.
Which, I am apt to think, might &s;ave the lives of
&s;everal, by what I have &s;een practi&s;ed on a dog
convul&s;ed and in all appearance dead, but in&s;tantly
reviving on being taken out of the abovementioned
grotto and thrown into a lake adjacent.</P>
<P>145. Air, the general men&s;truum and &s;eminary,
&s;eemeth to be only an aggregate of the volatile parts
of all natural beings, which variou&s;ly combined
and agitated produce many various effects. Small
particles in a near and clo&s;e &s;ituation &s;trongly act
upon each other, attracting, repelling, vibrating.
Hence divers fermentations, and all the variety of
meteors, tempe&s;ts, and concu&s;&s;ions both of earth
and firmament. Nor is the microco&s;m le&s;s affected
thereby. Being pent up in the vi&s;cera, ve&s;&s;els, and
membranes of the body, by it's &s;alts, &s;ulphurs,
and ela&s;tic power, it engenders cholics, &s;pa&s;ms,
hy&s;teric di&s;orders and other maladies.</P>
<P>146. The &s;pecific quality of air is taken to be
permanent ela&s;ticity. Mr. Boyle is expre&s;ly of this
opinion. And yet, whether there be any &s;uch
thing as permanently ela&s;tic air may be doubted,
there being many things which &s;eem to rob the air
<PB N="68" REF="67">
of this quality, or at lea&s;t le&s;&s;en and &s;u&s;pend it's
exertion. The &s;alts and &s;ulphurs, for in&s;tance, that
float in the air abate much of it's ela&s;ticity by their
attraction.</P>
<P>147. Upon the whole it is manife&s;t, that air is
no di&s;tinct element, but a ma&s;s or mixture of things
the mo&s;t heterogeneous and even oppo&s;ite to each
other<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">137, 145.</NOTE> which become air, by acquiring an
ela&s;ticity and volatility from the attraction of &s;ome
active, &s;ubtile &s;ub&s;tance; whether it be called fire,
aether, light, or the vital &s;pirit of the world; in
like manner as the particles of antimony, of them|&s;elves
not volatile, are carried off in &s;ublimation
and rendered volatile, by cohering with the par|ticles
of &s;al ammoniac. But action and reaction
being equal, the &s;pring of this aethereal &s;pirit is
dimini&s;hed by being imparted. It's velocity and
&s;ubtilty are al&s;o le&s;s from it's being mixed with
gro&s;&s;er particles. Hence &s;ound moves &s;lower than
light, as mud than clear water.</P>
<P>148. Whether air be only freed and fixed, or
generated and de&s;troyed, it is certain that air begins
and cea&s;es to exert or &s;hew it&s;elf. Much by expe|riments
&s;eems to be generated, not only from ani|mals,
fruits, and vegetables, but al&s;o from hard
bodies. And it is ob&s;erved by Sir I&s;aac Newton,
that air produced from hard bodies is mo&s;t ela&s;tic.
The tran&s;mutation of elements, each into other,
hath been anciently held. In Plutarch we find it
was the opinion of Heraclitus, that the death of
fire was a birth to air, and the death of air a birth
to water. This opinion is al&s;o maintained by
Sir I&s;aac Newton. Though it may be que&s;tioned,
whether what is thought a change be not only a
di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">
149. Fire &s;eems the mo&s;t ela&s;tic and expan&s;ive of
all bodies. It communicates this quality to moi&s;t
vapours and dry exhalations, when it heats and a|gitates
their parts, cohering clo&s;ely with them,
overcoming their former mutual attraction, and
cau&s;ing them, in&s;tead thereof, reciprocally to re|pel
each other and fly a&s;under, with a force pro|portionable
to that wherewith they had cohered.</P>
<P>150. Therefore in air we may conceive two
parts, the one more gro&s;s which was rai&s;ed and
carried off from the bodies of this terraqueous
ma&s;s: the other a fine &s;ubtile &s;pirit by means where|of
the former is rendered volatile and ela&s;tic.
Together they compo&s;e a medium, who&s;e ela&s;ticity
is le&s;s than that of pure aether, fire, or &s;pirit, in
proportion to the quantity of &s;alts, vapours, and
heterogeneous particles contained therein. Hence
it follows, that there is no &s;uch thing as a pure &s;im|ple
element of air. It follows al&s;o that on the high|e&s;t
mountains, air &s;hould be more rare than in pro|portion
to the vulgar rule, of the &s;paces being re|ciprocally
as the pre&s;&s;ures: and &s;o in fact it is &s;aid
to have been found, by the Gentlemen of the
French Academy of Sciences.</P>
<P>151. Aether, fire, or &s;pirit being attracted and
clogged by heterogeneous particles becometh le&s;s
active; and the particles cohering with tho&s;e of
aether, become more active than before. Air there|fore
is a ma&s;s of various particles, abraded and &s;ub|limated
from wet and dry bodies of all &s;orts, co|hering
with particles of aether; the whole per|meated
by pure aether, or light, or fire: for the&s;e
words are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly by ancient philo&s;o|phers.</P>
<P>152. This aether or pure invi&s;ible fire, the
mo&s;t &s;ubtile and ela&s;tic of all bodies, &s;eems to
<PB N="70" REF="69">
pervade and expand it &s;elf throughout the whole
univer&s;e. If air be the immediate agent or in&s;tru|ment
in natural things, it is the pure invi&s;ible fire
that is the fir&s;t natural mover or &s;pring, from
whence the air derives it's power<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">139, 149, 151.</NOTE>. This migh|ty
agent is every where at hand, ready to break
forth into action, if not re&s;trained and governed
with the greate&s;t wi&s;dom. Being always re&s;tle&s;s
and in motion, it actuates and enlivens the whole
vi&s;ible ma&s;s, is equally fitted to produce and to
de&s;troy, di&s;tingui&s;hes the various &s;tages of nature,
and keeps up the perpetual round of generations
and corruptions, pregnant with forms which it
con&s;tantly &s;ends forth and re&s;orbs. So quick in
it's motions, &s;o &s;ubtile and penetrating in it's na|ture,
&s;o exten&s;ive in it's effects, it &s;eemeth no o|ther
than the vegetative &s;oul or vital &s;pirit of the
world.</P>
<P>153. The animal &s;pirit in man is the in&s;tru|mental
or phy&s;ical cau&s;e both of &s;en&s;e and mo|tion.
To &s;uppo&s;e &s;en&s;e in the world, would be
gro&s;s and unwarranted. But loco-motive faculties
are evident in all it's parts. The Pythagoreans,
Platoni&s;ts, and Stoics held the world to be an ani|mal.
Though &s;ome of them have cho&s;en to con|&s;ider
it as a vegetable. However the phaenomena
and effects do plainly &s;hew there is a &s;pirit that
moves, and a mind or providence that pre&s;ides.
This providence, Plutarch &s;aith, was thought to
be in regard to the world, what the &s;oul is in re|gard
to man.</P>
<P>154. The order and cour&s;e of things, and the
experiments we daily make, &s;hew there is a mind
that governs and actuates this mundane &s;y&s;tem,
as the proper real agent and cau&s;e. And that the
<PB N="71" REF="70">
inferior in&s;trumental cau&s;e is pure aether, fire, or
the &s;ub&s;tance of light<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">29, 37, 136, 149.</NOTE> which is applied and de|termined
by an infinite mind in the macroco&s;m or
univer&s;e, with unlimited power, and according
to &s;tated rules; as it is in the microco&s;m, with
limited power and &s;kill by the humane mind.
We have no proof, either from experiment or
rea&s;on, of any other agent or efficient cau&s;e than
mind or &s;pirit. When therefore we &s;peak of cor|poreal
agents or corporeal cau&s;es, this is to be un|der&s;tood
in a different, &s;ubordinate, and improper
&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>155. The principles whereof a thing is com|pounded,
the in&s;trument u&s;ed in it's production,
and the end for which it was intended, are all in
vulgar u&s;e termed cau&s;es, though none of them be
&s;trictly &s;peaking agent or efficient. There is not
any proof that an extended corporeal or mecha|nical
cau&s;e doth really and properly act, even mo|tion
it &s;elf being in truth a pa&s;&s;ion. Therefore
though we &s;peak of this fiery &s;ub&s;tance as acting,
yet it is to be under&s;tood only as a mean or in|&s;trument,
which indeed is the ca&s;e of all mecha|nical
cau&s;es what&s;oever. They are neverthele&s;s
&s;ometimes termed agents and cau&s;es, although they
are by no means active in a &s;trict and proper &s;ig|nification.
When, therefore, force, power, vir|tue,
or action are mentioned as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in an
extended and corporeal or mechanical being, this
is not to be taken in a true genuine and real, but
only in a gro&s;s and popular &s;en&s;e, which &s;ticks
in appearances, and doth not anali&s;e things to
their $ir&s;t principles. In compliance with e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
language, and the u&s;e of the world, we
mu&s;t employ the popular current phra&s;e. But
then in regard to truth we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="72" REF="71">
it's meaning. It may &s;uffice to have made this
declaration once for all, in order to avoid mi&s;|takes.</P>
<P>156. The calidum innatum, the vital flame,
or animal &s;pirit in man is &s;uppo&s;ed the cau&s;e of
all motions, in the &s;everal parts of his body, whe|ther
voluntary or natural. That is, it is the in|&s;trument,
by means whereof the mind exerts and
manife&s;ts her &s;elf in the motions of the body. In
the &s;ame &s;en&s;e may not fire be &s;aid to have force,
to operate, and agitate the whole &s;y&s;tem of the
world, which is held together and informed by
one pre&s;iding mind, and animated throughout
by one and the &s;ame fiery &s;ub&s;tance, as an in&s;tru|mental
and mechanical agent, not as a primary
real efficient?</P>
<P>157. This pure &s;pirit or invi&s;ible fire is ever
ready to exert and &s;hew it &s;elf in it's effects<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">152.</NOTE>,
cheri&s;hing, heating, fermenting, di&s;&s;olving, &s;hin|ing
and operating in various manners, where a
&s;ubject offers to employ or determine it's force. It
is pre&s;ent in all parts of the earth and firmament,
though perhaps latent and unob&s;erved, till &s;ome
accident produceth it into act, and renders it vi&s;i|ble
in it's effects.</P>
<P>158. There is no effect in nature, great, mar|vellous,
or terrible but proceeds from fire, that
diffu&s;ed and active principle, which at the &s;ame
time that it &s;hakes the earth and heavens, will en|ter,
divide, and di&s;&s;olve the &s;mallest, clo&s;e&s;t, and
mo&s;t compacted bodies. In remote cavities of the
earth it remains quiet, till perhaps an accidental
&s;park from the colli&s;ion of one &s;tone again&s;t an|other
kindles an exhalation, that gives birth to an
earthquake or tempe&s;t, which &s;plits mountains, or
overturns cities. This &s;ame fire &s;tands un&s;een in
<PB N="73" REF="72">
the focus of a burning gla&s;s, till &s;ubjects for it to
act upon come in it's way, when it is found to
melt, calcine, or vitrify the harde&s;t bodies.</P>
<P>159. No eye could ever hitherto di&s;cern, and
no &s;en&s;e perceive, the animal &s;pirit in a human
body, otherwi&s;e than from it's effects. The &s;ame
may be &s;aid of pure fire, or the &s;pirit of the uni|ver&s;e,
which is perceived only by means of &s;ome
other bodies, on which it operates, or with which
it is joined. What the chymi&s;ts &s;ay, of pure acid's
being never found alone, might as well be &s;aid of
pure fire.</P>
<P>160. The mind of man acts by an in&s;trument
nece&s;&s;arily. The <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or mind pre&s;iding
in the world, acts by an in&s;trument freely. With|out
in&s;trumental and &s;econd cau&s;es, there could be
no regular cour&s;e of nature. And without a re|gular
cour&s;e, nature could never be under&s;tood.
Mankind mu&s;t always be at a lo&s;s, not knowing
what to expect, or how to govern them&s;elves, or
direct their actions for the obtaining of any end.
Therefore in the government of the world phy&s;ical
agents, improperly &s;o called, or mechanical, or
&s;econd cau&s;es, or natural cau&s;es, or in&s;truments,
are nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t, not the governor, but the
governed.</P>
<P>161. In the human body the mind orders and
moves the limbs: but the animal &s;pirit is &s;up|po&s;ed
the immediate phy&s;ical cau&s;e of their mo|tion.
So likewi&s;e in the mundane &s;y&s;tem, a mind
pre&s;ides, but the immediate, mechanical, or in|&s;trumental
cau&s;e, that moves or animates all it's
parts, is the pure elementary fire or &s;pirit of the
world. The more fine and &s;ubtile part or &s;pirit,
is &s;uppo&s;ed to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of the fir&s;t
mover, and communicate them to the gro&s;&s;er &s;en|&s;ible
parts of this world. Motion, though in me|taphy&s;ical
<PB N="74" REF="73">
rigor and truth a pa&s;&s;ion or mere effect,
yet, in phy&s;ics, pa&s;&s;eth for an action. And by this
action all effects are &s;uppo&s;ed to be produced.
Hence the various communications, determinati|ons,
accelerations of motion con&s;titute the laws of
nature.</P>
<P>162. The pure aether or invi&s;ible fire contains
parts of different kinds, that are impre&s;&s;ed with
different forces, or &s;ubjected to different laws of
motion, attraction, repul&s;ion and expan&s;ion, and
endued with divers di&s;tinct habitudes towards other
bodies, The&s;e &s;eem to con&s;titute the many vari|ous
qualities<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">37, 40, 4.</NOTE>, virtues, flavours, odours, and co|lour,
which di&s;tingui&s;h natural productions. The
different modes of cohae&s;ion, attraction, repul&s;ion
and motion, appear to be the &s;ource from whence
the &s;pecific properties are derived, rather than diffe|rent
&s;hapes or figures. This, as hath been already
ob&s;erved, &s;eems confirmed by the experiment of
fixed &s;alts operating one way, notwith&s;tanding the
difference of their angles. The original particles
productive of odours, flavours, and other proper|ties,
as well as of colours, are, one may &s;u&s;pect, all
contained and blended together in that universal and
original &s;eminary of pure elementary fire; from
which they are diver&s;ly &s;eparated and attracted, by
the various &s;ubjects of the animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms; which thereby become cla&s;&s;ed
into kinds, and endued with tho&s;e di&s;tinct: proper|ties,
which continue till their &s;everal forms, or &s;pe|cific
proportions of fire return into the common ma&s;s.</P>
<P>163. As the &s;oul acts immediately on pure $ire,
&s;o pure fire operates immediately on air. That is,
the abra&s;ions of all terre&s;trial things being rendered
volatile and ela&s;tic by fire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">149, 150, 152.</NOTE>, and at the &s;ame time
le&s;&s;ening the volatility and expan&s;ive force of the
<PB N="75" REF="74">
fire, who&s;e particles they attract and adhere to<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">147.</NOTE>,
there is produced a new fluid, more volatile than
water or earth, and more fixed than fire. There|fore
the virtues and operations imputed to air mu&s;t
be ultimately attributed to fire, as that which im|parts
activity to air it &s;elf.</P>
<P>164. The element of aethereal fire or light &s;eems
to comprehend, in a mixed &s;tate, the &s;eeds, the na|tural
cau&s;es and forms<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE> of all &s;ublunary things.
The gro&s;&s;er bodies do &s;eparate, attract, and repel
the &s;everal con&s;tituent particles of that heterogene|ous
element; which, being parted from the common
ma&s;s, make di&s;tinct e&s;&s;ences, producing and com|bining
together &s;uch qualities and properties, as are
peculiar to the &s;everal &s;ubjects, and thence often ex|tracted
in e&s;&s;ential oils or odoriferous waters, from
whence they exhale into the open air, and return
into their original element.</P>
<P>165. Blue, red, yellow, and other colours, have
been di&s;covered by Sir I&s;aac Newton to depend on
the parted rays or particles of light. And in like
manner, a particular odour or flavour, &s;eemeth to
depend on peculiar particles of light or fire<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">40.</NOTE>; as
appears from heats being nece&s;&s;ary to all vegetation
what&s;oever, and from the extreme minutene&s;s and
volatility of tho&s;e vegetable &s;ouls or forms, flying
off from the &s;ubjects without any &s;en&s;ible diminuti|on
of their weight. The&s;e particles, blended in one
common ocean, &s;hould &s;eem to conceal the di&s;tinct
forms, but, parted and attracted by proper &s;ub|jects,
di&s;clo&s;e or produce them. As the particles
of light, which, when &s;eparated, &s;orm di&s;tinct co|lours,
being blended are lo&s;t in one uniform ap|pearance.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">
166. Agreeably thereto, an aethereal &s;ub&s;tance
or fire was &s;uppo&s;ed by Heraclitus to be the &s;eed
of the generation of all things, or that from which
all things drew their original. The Stoics al&s;o
tanght, that all &s;ub&s;tance was originally fire, and
&s;hould return to fire: that an active &s;ubtile fire was
diffu&s;ed or expanded throughout the whole uni|ver&s;e;
the &s;everal parts whereof were produced,
&s;u&s;tained, and held together by it's force. And it
was the opinion of the Pythagoraeans, as Laertius
informs us, that heat or fire was the principle of
life animating the whole &s;y&s;tem, and penetrating
all the elements<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">152, 153.</NOTE>. The Platoni&s;ts too, as well
as the Pythagoraeans, held fire to be the immedi|ate
natural agent, or animal &s;pirit; to cheri&s;h, to
warm, to heat, to enlighten, to vegetate, to pro|duce
the dige&s;tions, circulations, &s;ecretions, and or|ganical
motions in all living bodies, vegetable or
animal, being effects of that element, which, as
it actuates the macroco&s;m, &s;o it animates the mi|croco&s;m.
In the Timaeus of Plato, there is &s;uppo|&s;ed
&s;omething like a net of fire, and rays of fire
in a human body. Doth not this &s;eem to mean
the animal &s;pirit, flowing, or rather darting through
the nerves?</P>
<P>167. According to the Peripatetics, the form
of heaven, or the fiery aethereal &s;ub&s;tance, contains
the forms of all inferior beings<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE>. It may be &s;aid
to teem with forms, and impart them to &s;ubjects
&s;itted to receive them. The vital force thereof in
the Peripatetic &s;en&s;e is vital to all, but diver&s;ly re|ceived
according to the diver&s;ity of the &s;ubjects.
So all colours are virtually contained in the light;
but their actual di&s;tinctions of blue, red, yellow,
and the re&s;t, depend on the difference of the ob|jects
<PB N="77" REF="76">
which it illu&s;trates. Ari&s;totle, in the book de
mundo, &s;uppo&s;eth a certain fifth e&s;&s;ence, an aethe|real
nature unchangeable and impa&s;&s;ive; and next
in order a &s;ubtile, flaming &s;ub&s;tance, lighted up,
or &s;et on fire by that aethereal and divine nature.
He &s;uppo&s;eth, indeed, that God is in heaven, but
that his power, or a force derived from him, doth
actuate and pervade the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>168. If we may credit Plutarch, Empedocles
thought aether or heat to be Jupiter. Aether by
the ancient philo&s;ophers was u&s;ed to $ignify promi&s;|cuously
&s;ometimes fire and &s;ometimes air. For
they di&s;tingui&s;hed two &s;orts of air. Plato in the
Timaeus &s;peaking of air &s;aith there are two kinds,
the one more fine and &s;ubtile, called aether, the o|ther
more gro&s;s and replete with vapours! This
aether or purer medium &s;eems to have been the air
or principle, from which all things according to
Anaximenes derived their birth, and into which
they were back again re&s;olved at their death. Hip|pocrates,
in his treati&s;e de diaeta, &s;peaketh of a
fire pure and invi&s;ible; and this fire, according
to him, is that which, &s;tirring and giving move|ment
to all things, cau&s;es them to appear, or,
as he &s;tiles it, come into evidence, that is to ex|ist,
every one in it's time, and according to it's
de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>169. This pure fire, aether, or &s;ub&s;tance of
light, was accounted in it &s;elf invi&s;ible and im|perceptible
to all our &s;en&s;es, being perceived only
by it's effects, &s;uch as heat, flame, and rarefaction.
To which we may add, that the moderns pretend
farther to have perceived it by weight, ina&s;much as
the aromatic oils which mo&s;t abound with fire, as
being the mo&s;t readily and vehemently enflamed,
are above all others the heavie&s;t. And by an ex|periment
of Mr. Homberg's, four ounces of regu|lus
<PB N="78" REF="77">
of antimony, being calcined by a burning gla&s;s
for an hour together, were found to have imbibed
and fixed &s;even drams of the &s;ub&s;tance of light.</P>
<P>170. Such is the rarefying and expan&s;ive force
of this element, as to produce in an in&s;tant of time
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tupendous effects: a &s;uffici|ent
proof not only of the power of fire, but al&s;o
of the wi&s;dom with which it is managed, and with|held
from bur&s;ting forth every moment to the ut|ter
ravage and de&s;truction of all things. And it is
very remarkable, that this &s;ame element, &s;o fierce
and de&s;tructive, &s;hould yet be &s;o variously temper|ed
and applied, as to be withal the &s;alutary warmth,
the genial, cheri&s;hing, and vital flame of all living
creatures. It is not therefore to be wondered that
Ari&s;totle thought, the heat of a living body to be
&s;omewhat divine and cele&s;tial, derived from that
pure aether to which he &s;uppo&s;ed the incorporeal
deity (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) to be immediately united, or
on which he &s;uppo&s;ed it immediately to act.</P>
<P>171. The Platoni&s;ts held that intellect re&s;ided in
&s;oul, and &s;oul in an aethereal vehicle. And that as
the &s;oul was a middle nature reconciling intellect
with aether; &s;o aether was another middle nature,
which reconciled and connected the &s;oul with gro&s;&s;er
bodies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">152, 154.</NOTE>. Galen likewi&s;e taught that, admitting
the &s;oul to be incorporeal, it hath for it's immedi|ate
tegument or vehicle a body of aether or fire,
by the intervention whereof it moveth other bodies
and is mutually affected by them. This interior
clothing was &s;uppo&s;ed to remain upon the &s;oul,
not only after death, but after the mo&s;t perfect pur|gation,
which in length of time according to the
followers of Plato and Pythagoras clean&s;ed the &s;oul,
&mdash;purumque reliquit</P>
<P>Aethereum &s;en&s;um atque aur&auml;i &s;implicis ignem.
<PB N="79" REF="78">
This tunicle of the &s;oul, whether it be called pure
aether, or luciform vehicle, or animal &s;pirit &s;eemeth
to be that which moves and acts upon the gro&s;s
organs, as it is determined by the &s;oul from which
it immediately receives impre&s;&s;ion, and in which
the moving force truly and properly re&s;ides. Some
moderns have thought fit to deride all that is &s;aid of
aethereal vehicles, as mere jargon or words without
a meaning. But they &s;hould have con&s;idered, that
all &s;peech concerning the &s;oul is altogether, or for
the mo&s;t part, metaphorical; and that, agreeably
thereunto, Plato &s;peaketh of the mind or &s;oul, as a
driver that guides and governs a chariot, which is,
not unfitly, &s;tiled <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> a luciform aethereal ve|hicle
or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, terms expre&s;&s;ive of the purity,
lightne&s;s, &s;ubtilty and mobility of that fine cele&s;tial
nature, in which the &s;oul immediately re&s;ides and
operates.</P>
<P>172. It was a tenet of the Stoics that the world
was an animal, and that providence an&s;wered to
the rea&s;onable &s;oul in man. But then the provi|dence
or mind was &s;uppo&s;ed by them to be im|mediately
re&s;ident or pre&s;ent in fire, to dwell there|in,
and to act thereby. Briefly, they conceived
God to be an intellectual and fiery &s;pirit, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Therefore though they looked
on fire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">166.</NOTE> as the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or governing principle
of the world; yet it was not &s;imply fire, but ani|mated
with a mind.</P>
<P>173. Such are the bright and lively &s;ignatures of
a divine mind, operating and di&s;playing it&s;elf in
fire and light throughout the world, that, as Ari|&s;totle
ob&s;erves in his book de mundo, all things
&s;eem full of divinities, whose apparitions on all
&s;ides &s;trike and dazzle our eyes. And it mu&s;t be
<PB N="80" REF="79">
owned, the chief philo&s;ophers and wi&s;e men of
antiquity, how much &s;oever they attributed to &s;e|cond
cau&s;es and the force of fire, yet they &s;uppo&s;ed
a mind or intellect always re&s;ident therein, active
or provident, re&s;training it's force and directing it's
operations.</P>
<P>174. Thus Hippocrates in his treati&s;e, de diaeta,
&s;peaks of a &s;trong but invi&s;ible fire<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">168.</NOTE>, that rules
all things without noi&s;e. Herein, &s;aith he, re&s;ides
&s;oul, under&s;tanding, prudence, growth, motion,
diminution, change, &s;leep and waking. This is
what governs all things and is never in repo&s;e. And
the &s;ame author, in his tract, de carnibus, after a
&s;erious preface &s;etting forth that he is about to de|clare
his own opinion, expre&s;&s;eth it in the&s;e terms.
That which we call heat <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> appears to me
&s;omething immortal, which under&s;tands all things,
which &s;ees and knows both what is pre&s;ent, and
what is to come.</P>
<P>175. This &s;ame is al&s;o what Hippocrates calls
nature, the author of life and death, good and evil.
It is farther to be noted of this heat, that he maketh
it the object of no &s;en&s;e. It is that occult, univer|&s;al
nature, and inward invi&s;ible force, which actu|ates
and animates the whole world, and was wor|&s;hiped
by the ancients under the name of Saturn;
which Vo&s;&s;ius judges not improbably to be derived
from the Hebrew word Satar, to lye hidden or con|cealed.
And what hath been delivered by Hip|pocrates
agrees with the notions of other philo&s;o|phers:
Heraclitus,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">166.</NOTE> for in&s;tance, who held fire
to be the principle and cau&s;e of the generation of
all things, did not mean thereby an inanimate ele|ment,
but, as he termed it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, an ever|living
fire.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80">
176. Theophra&s;tus, in his book, de igne;
di&s;tingui&s;heth between heat and fire. The
fir&s;t he con&s;iders as a principle or cau&s;e, not
that which appeareth to &s;en&s;e as a pa&s;&s;ion or
accident exi&s;ting in a &s;ubject, and which is in
truth the effect of that un&s;een principle. And
it is remarkable, that he refers the treating of
this invi&s;ible fire or heat, to the inve&s;tigation
of the fir&s;t cau&s;es. Fire, the principle, is nei|ther
generated nor de&s;troyed, is every where
and always pre&s;ent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>: while it's effects in dif|ferent
times and places &s;hew them&s;elves more or
le&s;s, and are very various, &s;oft and cheri&s;hing,
or violent and de&s;tructive, terrible or agreeable,
conveying good and evil, growth and decay,
life and death, throughout the mundane &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>177. It is allowed by all, that the Greeks
derived much of their philo&s;ophy from the
Ea&s;tern nations. And Heraclitus is thought
by &s;ome to have drawn his principles from
Orpheus, as Orpheus did from the Aegyptians; or,
as others write, he had been auditor of Hippa&s;us
a Pythagorean, who held the &s;ame notion of fire;
and might have derived it from Aegypt by his
ma&s;ter Pythagoras, who had travelled into Aegypt,
and been in&s;tructed by the Sages of that nation.
One of who&s;e tenets it was, that fire was the
principle of all action; which is agreeable to the
doctrine of the Stoics, that the whole of things is
admini&s;tered by a fiery intellectual Spirit. In the
A&s;clepian Dialogue, we find this notion, that all
parts of the world vegetate by a fine &s;ubtil aether,
which acts as an engine or in&s;trument, &s;ubject to
the will of the &s;upreme God.</P>
<P>178. As the Platoni&s;ts held intellect to be
lodged in &s;oul, and &s;oul in aether<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">171.</NOTE>; &s;o it pa&s;&s;eth,
<PB N="82" REF="81">
for a doctrine of Tri&s;megi&s;tus in the Pimander,
that mind is cloathed by &s;oul, and &s;oul by &s;pirit.
Therefore as the animal &s;pirit of man, being &s;ub|til
and luminous, is the immediate tegument of
the human &s;oul, or that wherein and whereby &s;he
acts; even &s;o the &s;pirit of the World, that active
fiery aethereal &s;ubstance of Light, that permeates

And in the Chaldaic oracles, all things are &s;up|po&s;ed

which oriental reduplication of the word
fire, &s;eems to imply the extreme purity and force

Hebrew letters being the &s;ame with tho&s;e in the

in the pointing, which is ju&s;tly counted a late in|vention.
That other &s;cripture &s;entence is remarka|ble:

<P>180. A notion of &s;omething divine in Fire,
animating the whole world, and ordering it's &s;e|veral
parts, was a tenet of very general extent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">156, 157, 163, 166, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173, 174, 175, 177, &amp;$.</NOTE>,

being embraced in the mo&s;t di&s;tant times and
places, even among the Chine&s;e them&s;elves; who
make tien, aether, or heaven, the &s;overeign prin|ciple,
or cau&s;e of all things, and teach that the
caele&s;tial virtue, by them called li, when joined to
corporeal &s;ub&s;tance, doth fa&s;hion, di&s;tinguish, and
&s;pecificate all natural beings. This li of the Chi|ne&s;e
&s;eems to an&s;wer the forms of the peripatetics.
And both bear analogy to the foregoing philo&s;o|phy
of Fire.</P>
<P>181. The Heaven is &s;uppo&s;ed pregnant with
virtues and forms, which con&s;titute and di&s;crimi|nate
the various &s;pecies of things. And we have
more than once ob&s;erved, that, as the light, fire,
or caele&s;tial aether, being parted by refracting or
reflecting bodies, produceth variety of colours;
even &s;o, that &s;ame apparently uniform &s;ub&s;tance
being parted and &s;ecreted by the attracting and re|pelling
powers of the divers &s;ecretory ducts of
plants and animals, that is, by natural chemi&s;try,
produceth or imparteth the various &s;pecific pro|perties
of natural bodies. Whence the ta&s;tes and
odours and medicinal virtues &s;o various in vegeta|bles.</P>
<P>182. The tien is con&s;idered and adored by the
learned Chine&s;e, as living and intelligent aether,
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the Chaldaeans and the Stoics. And
the wor&s;hip of things caele&s;tial, the Sun and Stars,
among the Ea&s;tern nations le&s;s remote, was on ac|count
of their fiery nature, their heat and light,
and the influence thereof. Upon the&s;e accounts,
the Sun was looked on by the Greek Theologers
as the &s;pirit of the world, and the power of the
world. The clean&s;ing quality, the light and heat
of fire are natural &s;ymbols of purity, knowledge,
and power, or, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the things them|&s;elves
<PB N="84" REF="83">
&s;o far as they are perceptible to our &s;en&s;es,
or in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as motion is &s;aid to be action.
Accordingly, we find a religious regard was paid
to fire, both by Greeks and Romans, and indeed
by mo&s;t if not all, the nations or the world.</P>
<P>183. The wor&s;hip of Ve&s;ta at Rome was, in
truth, the wor&s;hip of Fire.</P>
<P>Nec tu aliud Ve&s;$am quam vivam intellige flam|mam,
Saith Ovid in his Fa&s;ti. And as in old Rome
the eternal Fire was religiou&s;ly kept by virgins, &s;o
In Greece, particularly at Delphi and Athens, it
was kept by widows. It is well known that
Vulcan or Fire was wor&s;hipped wish great di|&s;tinction
by the Aegyptians. The Zabii or Sa|beans
are al&s;o known to have been wor&s;hippers
of Fire. It appears too from the Chaldaeans ora|cles,
that Fire was regarded as divine by the &s;ages
of that nation. And it is &s;uppo&s;ed that Ur of the
Chaldaeans was &s;o called from the Hebrew word
&s;ignifying fire, becau&s;e fire was publickly wor|&s;hiped
in that city. That a religious wor&s;hip was
paid to fire by the ancient Per&s;ians and their Ma|gi,
is atte&s;ted by all antiquity. And the &s;ect of
Per&s;ees, or old Gentils, of whom there are con|&s;iderable
remains at this day both in the Mogols
country and in Per&s;ia, doth te&s;tify the &s;ame.</P>
<P>184. It doth not &s;eem that there pro&s;trations
before the perpetual $ires, pre&s;erved with great
care in their Pyreia, or fire temples, were merely
a civil re&s;pect, as Dr. Hyde would have it thought.
Although he brings good proof that they do not
invoke the fire on their altars, or pray to it, or
call it God: and that they acknowledge a &s;upreme
invi&s;ible deity. Civil respects are paid to things
<PB N="85" REF="84">
as related to civil power: but &s;uch relation doth
not appear in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. It &s;hou'd &s;eem
therefore, that they wor&s;hip God as pre&s;ent in
the fire, which they wor&s;hip or reverence, not
ultimately or for it &s;elf, but relatively to the &s;u|preme
being. Which it is not unlikely was el&s;e|where
the ca&s;e at fir&s;t; though the practice of
men, e&s;pecially of the vulgar, might in length
of time degenerate from the original in&s;titution,
and re&s;t in the object of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>185. Doctor Hyde, in his hi&s;tory of the re|ligion
of the ancient Per&s;ians, would have it
thought, that they borrowed the u&s;e and reverence
or perpetual fires, from the Jewi&s;h practice pre|&s;cribed
in the Levitical law, of keeping a per|petual
fire burning oh the altar. Whether that
was the ca&s;e or not, thus much one may venture
to &s;ay, it &s;eems probable that whatever was the
original of this cu&s;tom among the Per&s;ians, the
like cu&s;toms among the Greeks and Romans
ware derived from, the &s;ame, &s;ource.</P>
<P>186. IT mu&s;t be owned there are many pa&s;|&s;ages
in holy &s;cripture<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">179.</NOTE>, that would make one
think, the &s;upreme being was in a peculiar man|ner
pre&s;ent and manife&s;t in the element of fire.
Not to in&s;i&s;t that God is more than once &s;aid to
be a con&s;uming fire, which might be under&s;tood
in a metaphorical &s;en&s;e, the divine apparitions
were by fire, in the bu&s;h, at mount Sinai, on
the tabernacle, in the cloven tongues. God is
repre&s;ented in the in&s;pired writings, as de&s;cend|ing
in fire, as attended by fire, or with fire going
before him. Caele&s;tial things as Angels, chariots,
and &s;uch like phaenomena are inve&s;ted with fire,
light, and &s;plendor. Ezekiel in his vi&s;ions beheld
<PB N="86" REF="85">
fire and brightne&s;s, lamps, burning coals of fire,
and fla&s;hes of lightening. In a vi&s;ion of Daniel
the throne of God appeared like a &s;iery flame,
and his wheels like burning fire. Al&s;o a &s;iery
flame i&s;&s;ued and came forth from before him.</P>
<P>187. At the transfiguration, the apo&s;tles &s;aw
our &s;aviour's face &s;hining as the &s;un, and his r$i|ment
white as light, al&s;o a lucid cloud or body
of light, out of which the voice came; which
vi&s;ible light and &s;plendor was, not many centuries
ago, maintained by the Greek church, to have
been divine, and uncreated, and the very glory
of God: as may be &s;een in the hi&s;tory wrote by
the Emperor John Cantacuzene. And of late
years Bi&s;hop Patrick gives it as his opinio$, that
in the beginning of the world, the Shecinah or
divine pre&s;ence, which was then frequent and or|dinary,
appeared by light or fire. In commenting
on that pa&s;&s;age, where Cain is &s;aid to have gone
out form the pre&s;ence of the Lord, the Bi&s;hop ob|&s;erves,
that If Cain after this turned a downright
idolater, as many think, it is very likely he in|troduced
the wor&s;hip of the &s;un, as the be&s;t re|&s;emblance
he could find of the glory of the Lord,
which was wont to appear in a flaming light. It
would be endle&s;s to enumerate all the pa&s;&s;ages of
holy &s;cripture, which confirm and illu&s;trate this
notion, or repre&s;ent the Deity as appearing and
operating by fire. The mi&s;construction of which
might po&s;&s;ibly have mi$$ed the Gno&s;tics, $word$,
and other ancient Heretics into $n opinion, that
Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the vi&s;ible corporeal $word$.</P>
<P>188. We have &s;een, that in the mo&s;t $$emote
ages and countries, the vulgar as well as the learn|ed,
the in&s;titutions of lawgivers, as well $word$ the
rea&s;onings of philo&s;ophers, have ever con&s;idered
<PB N="87" REF="86">
the element of fire in a peculiar light, and treated
it with more than common regard, as if it were
&s;omething of a very &s;ingular and extraordinary
nature. Nor are there wanting authors of princi|pal
account among the moderns, who entertain
like notions concerning fire, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e
who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant in that element, and
&s;hould &s;eem be&s;t acquainted with it.</P>
<P>189. Mr. Homberg the famous modern chemi&s;t,
who brought that art to &s;o great perfection, holds
the &s;ub&s;tance of light or fire to be the true chemic
principal &s;ulphur,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">129</NOTE> and to extend it &s;elf through|out
the the whole univer&s;e. It is his opinion that
this is the only active principle. That mixed with
various things it formeth, &s;everal &s;orts of natural
productions, With &s;alts making oyl, with earth
bitumen, with mercury metal. That this princi|ple
of &s;ulphur, fire, or the &s;ub&s;tance of light, is in
it &s;elf imperceptible, and only becomes &s;en&s;ible
as it is joined with &s;ome other principle, which
&s;erves as a vehicle for it. That, although it be
the mo&s;t active of all things, yet it is at the &s;ame
time the mo&s;t firm bond and cement to combine
and hold the principles together, and give form to
the mixed bodies. And, that in the analy&s;is of
bodies it is always lo&s;t, e&s;caping the skill of the
arti&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing, through the clo&s;e&s;t ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>190. Boe$have, Niewenty't, and divers other
moderns are in the &s;ame way of thinking. They
with the ancients di&s;tingui&s;h a pure, elementary,
invi&s;ible fire from the culinary, or that which ap|pears
in ignited bodies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">163&punc; 166.</NOTE>. This la&s;t they will not
allow to be pure $ire. The pure fire is to be di&s;|cerned
by it's effects alone; &s;uch as heat, dila|tation
of all &s;olid bodies, and rarefaction of $luids,
<PB N="88" REF="87">
the &s;egregating heterogeneous bodies, and con|gregating
tho&s;e that are homogeneous. That
therefore which &s;mokes and flames is not pure fire,
but that which is collected in the focus of a mir|rour
or burning gla&s;s. This fire &s;eems the &s;ource
of all the operations in nature: without it nothing
either vegetates, or putrefies, lives or moves or
ferments, is di&s;&s;olved or compounded or altered
throughout this whole natural world in which we
&s;ub&s;i&s;t. Were it not for this, the whole wou'd
be one great stupid inanimate ma&s;s. But this
active element is &s;uppo&s;ed to be every where, and
always pre&s;ent, imparting different degrees of li&s;e
heat and motion, to the various animals vegeta|bles
and other natural productions, as well as to
the elements them&s;elves, wherein they are pro|duced
and nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>191. As water acts upon &s;alt, or aqua fortis up|on
iron, &s;o fire di&s;&s;olves all other bodies. Fire,
air, and water are all three men&s;truums: but the
two la&s;t &s;eem to derive all their force and activity
from the fir&s;t<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">149</NOTE>. And indeed there &s;eems to be,
originall$ or ultimately, but one men&s;truum in
nature, to which all other men&s;truums, may be
reduced. Acid &s;alts are a men&s;truum, but their
force and di&s;tinct powers are from &s;ulphur. Con|&s;idered
as pure, or in them&s;elves, they are all of
the &s;ame nature. But, as obtained by di&s;tilla|tion,
they are con&s;tantly joined with &s;ome &s;ul|phur,
which characterizeth and cannot be &s;epa|rated
from them. This is the doctrine of mon|sieur
Homberg. But what is it that characteriz|eth
or differenceth the &s;ulphurs them&s;elves? If
&s;ulphur be the &s;ub&s;tance of light, as that author
will have it, whence is it that animal, vege|table,
<PB N="89" REF="88">
and metallic &s;ulphurs impart different qua|lities
to the &s;ame acid &s;alt? Can this be ex|plained
upon Homberg's principles? And are
we not obliged to &s;uppo&s;e, that light &s;eparated
by the attracting and repelling powers in the &s;train|ers,
ducts, and pores of tho&s;e bodies, doth form
&s;everal di&s;tinct kinds of &s;ulphur, all which, be|fore
&s;uch &s;eparation, were lo&s;t and blended toge|ther,
in one common ma&s;s of light or fire &s;eem|ingly
homogeneous.</P>
<P>192. In the analy&s;is of inflammable bodies, the
fire or &s;ulphur lo&s;t, and the diminution of weight
&s;heweth the the lo&s;s<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">169.</NOTE>. Oil is re&s;olved into wa|ter,
earth, and &s;alt, none of which is inflamma|ble.
But the fire or vinculum which connected
tho&s;e things, and gave the form of oil, e&s;capes
from the arti&s;t. It di&s;appears but is not de&s;troyed.
Light or fire impri&s;oned made part of the com|pound,
gave union to the other parts, and form
to the whole. But having e&s;caped, it mingles
with the general ocean of aether, till being again
parted and attracted, it enters and &s;pecificates &s;ome
new &s;ubject, of the animal vegetable, or mineral
kingdom. Fire therefore in the &s;en&s;e of Philo|&s;ophers
is always fire, though not always flame.</P>
<P>193. Solar fire or light, in calcining certain
bodies, is ob&s;erved to add to their weight. There
it therefore no doubt but light can be fixed, and
enter the compo&s;ition of a body. And though it
&s;hould lye latent for a long time, yet, being &s;et
free from it's pri&s;on, it &s;hall &s;till &s;hew it&s;elf to be
fire. Lead, tin, or regulus of antimony, being
expo&s;ed to the fire of a burning gla&s;s, though they
lo&s;e much in &s;moke and &s;team, are nevertherle&s;s
found to be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in weight,
which proves the introduction of light or fire in|to
<PB N="90" REF="89">
their pores. It is al&s;o ob&s;erved, that urine pro|duceth
no pho&s;phorus, unle&s;s it be long expo&s;ed
to the &s;olar light. From all which it may be
concluded, that bodies do attract and fix the
light, whence it &s;hould &s;eem, as &s;ome have ob|&s;erved,
that fire without burning is an ingredi|ent
in many things, as water without wetting.</P>
<P>194. Of this there cannot be a better proof,
than the Experiment of mon&s;ieur Homberg, who
made gold of mercury by introducing light into
it's pores, but at &s;uch trouble and expence, that
I &s;uppo&s;e no body will try the experiment for
profit. By this junction of light and mercury,
both bodies became fixed, and produced a third
different from either, to wit, real gold. For the
truth of which fact, I refer to the memoirs of the
French academy of Sciences. From the forego|ing
experiment it appears, that Gold is only a
ma&s;s of Mercury penetrated and cemented by the
&s;ub&s;tance of light, the particles of tho&s;e bodies
attracting and fixing each other. This &s;eems to
have been not altogether unknown to former
Philo&s;ophers, Mar&s;ilius Ficinus the Platoni&s;t, in
his commentary on the fir&s;t book of the &s;econd
Ennead of Plotinus. And others likewi&s;e before
him, regarding Mercury as the mother, and Sul|phur
as the father of Metals; and Plato himself
in his Timaeus de&s;cribing gold, to be a den&s;e fluid
with a &s;hining yellow light, which well &s;uits a
compo&s;ition of light and Mercury.</P>
<P>195. Fire or light mixeth with all bodies<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>,
even with water; witne&s;s the fla&s;hing lights in
the Sea, who&s;e waves &s;eem frequently all in
fire. It's operations are various according to it's
kind, quantity, and degree of vehemence. One
<PB N="91" REF="90">
degree keeps water fluid, another turns it into ela|&s;tic
air<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">149.</NOTE>. And air it&s;elf &s;eems to be nothing
el&s;e but vapours and exhalations, rendered ela&s;tic
by fire. Nothing flames but oil: and &s;ulphur
with water, &s;alt, and earth compo&s;e oil; which
&s;ulphur is fire: therefore fire enclo&s;ed attracts
fire, and cau&s;eth the bodies who&s;e compo&s;ition it
enters to burn and blaze.</P>
<P>196. Fire collected in the focus of a gla&s;s ope|rates
in vacuo, and therefore is thought not to need air to
&s;upport it. Calx of lead hath gone
off with an explo&s;ion in vacuo, which Niewenty't
and others take for a proof that fire can burn
without air. But Mr. Hales attributes this effect
to air enclo&s;ed in the red lead, and perhaps to
in the receiver, which cannot be perfectly ex|hau&s;ted.
When common lead is put into the fire
in order to make red-lead, a greater weight of
this comes out than was put in of common lead.
Therefore the red-lead &s;hould &s;eem impregnated
with fire. Mr. Hales thinks it is with air. The
va&s;t expan&s;ion of compound aqua fortis, Mr.
Niewenty't will have to proceed from fire alone.
Mr. Hales contends that air mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily co|operate.
Though by Niewenty't's experiment it
&s;hould &s;eem, the pho&s;phorus burns equally,
with and without air.</P>
<P>197. Perhaps they who hold the oppo&s;ite &s;ides
in this que&s;tion, may be reconciled by ob&s;erving
that air is in reality nothing more than particles
of wet and dry bodies volatili&s;ed, and rendered
ela&s;tic by fire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">147. 150, 151.</NOTE>. Whatever therefore is done
by air mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to fire, which fire is a
&s;ubtile invi&s;ible thing, who&s;e operation is not to
be di&s;cerned but by means of &s;ome gro&s;&s;er body,
<PB N="92" REF="91">
which &s;erves not for a pabulum to nouri&s;h the
fire, but for a vehicle to arre&s;t and bring it into
view. Which &s;eems the &s;ole u&s;e of oil, air, or
any other thing, that vulgarly pa&s;&s;eth for a pa|bulum
or food of that element.</P>
<P>198. To explain this matter more clearly, it is
to be ob&s;erved, that fire, in order to become &s;en|&s;ible,
mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;ubject to act upon. This
being penetrated and agitated by fire affects us
with light, heat, or &s;ome other &s;en&s;ible alteration.
And this &s;ubject so wrought upon may be called
culinary fire. In the focus of a burning gla&s;s ex|po&s;ed
to the &s;un, there is real actual fire, though
not di&s;cerned by the &s;en&s;e, till it hath &s;omewhat
to work on, and can &s;hew it &s;elf in it's effects,
heating, flaming, melting, and the like. Every
ignited body is, in the foregoing &s;en&s;e, culinary
fire. But it will not therefore follow, that it is
convertible into pure elementary fire. This, for
ought that appears, may be ingenerable and in|corruptible
by the cour&s;e of nature. It may be
fixed and impri&s;oned in a compound<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">169, 1920 193.</NOTE>, and yet
retain it's nature, though lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e, and though
it return into the invi&s;ible elementary ma&s;s, upon
the analy&s;is of the compounded body: as is ma|nife&s;t
in the &s;olution of &s;tone lime by water.</P>
<P>199. It &s;hould &s;eem, therefore, that what is &s;aid
of air's being the pabulum of fire, or being con|verted
into fire, ought to be under&s;tood only in
this &s;en&s;e; to wit, that air being le&s;s gro&s;s than o|ther
bodies, is of a middle nature, and therefore
more fit to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of a fine aethe|rial
fire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">163.</NOTE>, and impart them to other things. Ac|cording
to the antients, &s;oul &s;erveth for a vehicle to
<PB N="93" REF="92">
intellect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">178.</NOTE>, and light or fire for a vehicle to the
&s;oul; and, in like manner, air may be &s;uppo&s;ed a
vehicle to fire, fixing it in &s;ome degree, and com|municating
it's effects to other bodies.</P>
<P>200. The pure invi&s;ible fire or aether doth per|meate
all bodies, even the harde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid
as the diamond. This alone, therefore, cannot as
&s;ome learned men have &s;uppo&s;ed, be the cau&s;e
of mu&s;cular motion, by a mere impul&s;e of the
nerves communicated from the brain to the mem|branes
of the mu&s;cles, and thereby to the enclo&s;ed
aether, who&s;e expan&s;ive motion, being by that
means increa&s;ed, is thought to &s;well the mu&s;cles
and cau&s;e a contraction of the fle&s;hy fibres. This
it &s;hou'd &s;eem, the pure aether cannot do immedi|ately,
and of it&s;elf, becau&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing it's expan|&s;ive
motion to be increa&s;ed, it mu&s;t still pa&s;s
through the membranes, and con&s;equently not
&s;well them, ina&s;much as aether is &s;uppo&s;ed freely
to pervade the mo&s;t solid bodies. It &s;hould &s;eem
therefore that this effect mu&s;t be owing, not to
pure aether, but to aether in &s;ome part fixed and
arre&s;ted by the particles of air.</P>
<P>201. Although this aether be extremely ela&s;tic,
yet, as it is &s;ometimes found by experience to be
attracted impri&s;oned and detained in gross bodies
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">169.</NOTE>, &s;o we may &s;uppo&s;e it to be attracted, and
it's expan&s;ive force dimini&s;hed, though it &s;hould
not be quite fixed, by the loo&s;e particles of air,
which combining and cohering therewith may
bring it down, and qualify it for intercour&s;e with
gro&s;&s;er things. Pure fire may be &s;aid to animate
air, and air other things. Pure fire is invi&s;ible;
therefore flame is not pure fire. Air is nece&s;&s;ary
both to li&s;e and flame. And it is found by experi|ment,
<PB N="94" REF="93">
that air lo&s;eth in the lungs the power of
feeding flame. Hence it is concluded, that the
&s;ame thing in air contributes both to life and flame.
Vital flame &s;urvives culinary flame in vacuo:
therefore it requires le&s;s of that thing to &s;u&s;tain it.</P>
<P>202. What this may be, whether &s;ome certain
proportion, or &s;ome peculiar parts of aether, is
not ea&s;y to &s;ay. But thus much &s;eems plain, that
whatever is a&s;cribed to acid may be al&s;o a&s;cribed
to fire or aether. The particles of aether fly a&s;un|der
with the greate&s;t force: therefore, agreeably
to &s;ir I&s;aac Newton's doctrine, when united they
mu&s;t attract each other with the greate&s;t force.
Therefore they con&s;titute the acid. For what&s;o|ever
&s;trongly attracts and is attracted, may be cal|led
an acid, as &s;ir I&s;aac Newton informs us in his
tract de acido. Hence it &s;hould &s;eem, that the
&s;ulphur of Homberg and the acid of &s;ir I&s;aac are
at bottom one and the &s;ame thing, to wit, pure
fire or aether.</P>
<P>203. The vital flame or aethereal &s;pirit, being
attracted and impri&s;oned in gro&s;&s;er bodies, &s;eem|eth
to be &s;et free and carried off, by the &s;uperior
attraction of a &s;ubtil and pure flame. Hence, per|haps
it is, that lightening kills animals, and turns
&s;pirituous liquors vapid in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>204. Hippocrates in his book concerning the
Heart ob&s;erveth, that the &s;oul of man is not nou|ri&s;hed
by meats and drinks from the lower belly,
but by a pure and luminous &s;ub&s;tance darting it's
rays, and di&s;tributing a non natural nouri&s;hment,
as he terms it, in like manner as that from the in|te&s;tines
is di&s;tributed to all parts of the body. This
luminous non natural nouri&s;hment, though it be
&s;ecreted from the blood, is expre&s;ly &s;aid not to
come from the lower belly. It is plain, therfore,
<PB N="95" REF="94">
he thought it came into the blood either by re&s;pi|ration,
or by attraction through the pores. And it
mu&s;t be acknowledged, that &s;omewhat igneous or
aethereal brought by the air into the blood &s;eems
to nouri&s;h, though not the &s;oul it &s;elf, yet the in|terior
tunicle of the &s;oul, the aurai &s;implicis ignem.</P>
<P>205. That there is really &s;uch a thing as vital
flame, actually kindled, nouri&s;h'd, and extingui&s;h'd
like common flame, and by the &s;ame means, is an
opinion of &s;ome moderns, particularly of Doctor
Willis in his tract de &s;anguinis accen&s;ione: that it
requires con&s;tant eventilation, through the trachaea
and pores of the body, for the di&s;charge of a
&s;uliginous and excrementitious vapour: and that
this vital flame, being extremely &s;ubtil, might
not be &s;een any more than &s;hining flies or ignes
fatui by day-light. And yet it hath &s;ometimes
become vi&s;ible on divers per&s;ons, of which there
are undoubted in&s;tances. This is Dr. Willis's no|tion:
and perhaps there may be &s;ome truth in this,
if it be &s;o under&s;tood, as that light or fire might
indeed con&s;titute the animal &s;pirit or immediate
vehicle of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>206. There have not been wanting tho&s;e, who,
not content to &s;uppo&s;e light the mo&s;t pure and re|fined
of all corporeal beings, have gone farther,
and be&s;towed upon it &s;ome attributes of a yet higher
nature. Julianus the Platonic philo&s;opher, as
cited by Ficinus, &s;aith it was a doctrine in the
theology of the Phaenicians, that there is diffu&s;ed
throughout the univer&s;e, a pellucid and &s;hining na|ture
pure and impa&s;&s;ive, the act of a pure intelli|gence.
And Ficinus him&s;elf undertakes to prove,
that light is incorporeal, by &s;everal arguments:
Becau&s;e it enlightens and fills a great &s;p$ce in an
in&s;tant, and without oppo&s;ition: Becau&s;e &s;everal
<PB N="96" REF="95">
lights meet without re&s;i&s;ting each other: Becau&s;e
light cannot be defiled by filth of any kind: Be|cau&s;e
the &s;olar light is not fixed in any &s;ubject:
La&s;tly, becau&s;e it contracts and expands it &s;elf &s;o
ea&s;ily without colli&s;ion, conden&s;ation, rarefaction,
or delay throughout the va&s;te&s;t &s;pace. The&s;e rea|&s;ons
are given by Ficinus, in his comment on the
fir&s;t book of the &s;econd Ennead of Plotinus.</P>
<P>207. But it is now well known, that light
moves, and that it's motion is not in&s;tantaneous:
that it is capable of conden&s;ation, rarefaction, and
colli&s;ion: that it can be mixed with other bodies,
enter their compo&s;ition, and increa&s;e their weight
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">168, 192, 193.</NOTE>. All which &s;eems &s;ufficiently to overthrow
tho&s;e arguments of Ficinus, and &s;hew light to be
corporeal. There appears indeed &s;ome difficulty
at fir&s;t &s;ight, about the non re&s;istance of rays or
particles of light occurring one to another, in
all po&s;&s;ible directions or from all points. Par|ticularly,
if we &s;uppo&s;e the hollow &s;urface of a
large &s;phere, &s;tudded with eyes looking inwards
one at another, it may perhaps &s;eem hard to con|ceive,
how di&s;tinct rays from every eye &s;hould
arrive at every other eye without ju&s;tling, re|pelling,
and confounding each other.</P>
<P>208. But the&s;e difficulties may be got over by
con&s;idering in the fir&s;t place, that vi&s;ible points
are not mathematical points, and con&s;equently
that we are not to &s;uppo&s;e every point of &s;pace a
radiating point. Secondly, by granting that
many rays do re&s;i&s;t and intercept each other, not|with&s;tanding
which the act of vi&s;ion may be
performed. Since as every point of the object
is not &s;een, so it is not nece&s;&s;ary that rays from
every &s;uch point arrive at the eye. We often &s;ee
<PB N="97" REF="96">
an object, though more dimly, when many rays
are intercepted by a gro&s;&s; medium.</P>
<P>209. Be&s;ides we may &s;uppo&s;e the particles of
light to be indefinitely &s;mall, that is as &s;mall as
we plea&s;e, and their aggregate to bear as &s;mall a
proportion to the void as we plea&s;e, there being
nothing in this that contradicts the phaenomena.
And there needs nothing more, in order to con|ceive
the po&s;&s;ibility of rays pa&s;&s;ing from and to
all vi&s;ible points, although they be not incorpo|real.
Suppo&s;e a hundred ports placed round a
circular &s;ea, and &s;hips &s;ailing from each port to
every other; the larger the &s;ea, and the &s;maller
the ve&s;&s;els are &s;uppo&s;ed, the le&s;s danger will there
be of their &s;triking again&s;t each other. But as
there is by hypothe&s;is no limited proportion be|tween
the &s;ea and the &s;hips, the void and &s;olid
particles of light, so there is no difficulty that can
oblige us to conclude the &s;un's light incorporeal
from it's free pa&s;&s;age; e&s;pecially when there are
so many clear proofs of the contrary. As for the
difficulty, therefore, attending the &s;uppo&s;ition of
a &s;phere &s;tudded with eyes looking at each other,
this is removed only by &s;uppo&s;ing the particles
of light exceeding &s;mall relatively to the empty
&s;paces.</P>
<P>210. Plotinus &s;uppo&s;eth, that from the &s;un's
light which is corporeal, there &s;prings forth ano|ther
equivocal light which is incorporeal, and as
it were the brightne&s;s of the former. Mar&s;ilius
Ficinus al&s;o, ob&s;erving it to be a doctrine in the
Timaeus of Plato, that there is an occult fire or
&s;pirit diffu&s;ed throughout the univer&s;e, intimates
that this &s;ame occult invi&s;ible fire or light is, as it
were, the &s;ight of the mundane &s;oul. And Plo|tinus
in his fourth Ennead &s;heweth it to be his
opinion, that the world &s;eeth it &s;elf and all it's
<PB N="98" REF="97">
parts. The Platonic philo&s;ophers do wonderfully
refine upon light, and &s;oar very high: from coal
to flame; from flame to light; from this vi&s;ible
light to the occult light of the cele&s;tial or mun|dane
&s;oul, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to pervade and
agitate the &s;ub&s;tance of the univer&s;e by it's vigo|rous
and expan&s;ive motion.</P>
<P>211. If we may believe Diogenes Laertius, the
Pythagorean philo&s;ophers thought there was a
certain pure heat or fire, which had &s;omewhat divine
in it, by the participation whereof men be|came
allied to the Gods. And according to the
Platoni&s;ts, Heaven is not defined &s;o much by it's
local &s;ituation, as by it's purity. The pure&s;t and
mo&s;t excellent fire, that is Heaven, &s;aith Ficinus.
And again, the hidden fire that every where ex|erts
it &s;elf, he calls cele&s;tial. He repre&s;ents fire
as mo&s;t powerful and active, dividing all things,
abhorring all compo&s;ition or mixture with other
bodies. And, as &s;oon as it gets free, relap&s;ing
in&s;tantly into the common ma&s;s of cele&s;tial fire,
which is every where pre&s;ent and latent.</P>
<P>112. This is the general &s;ource of life, &s;pirit,
and &s;trength, and, therefore of health to all ani|mals,
who con&s;tantly receive it's illap&s;es cloathed
in air, through the lungs and pore&s; of the body.
The &s;ame &s;pirit impri&s;oned in food and medicines,
is conveyed into the &s;tomach, the bowels, the
lacteals, circulated and &s;ecreted by the &s;everal
ducts, and di&s;tributed throughout the &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">37, 42, 44.</NOTE>.
Plato in his Timaeus enumerating the ignited
juices, names wine in the fir&s;t place, and tar in
the &s;econd. But wine is pre&s;&s;ed from the grape,
and fermented by human indu&s;try. Therefore of
all ignited juices purely natural, tar or re&s;in mu&s;t
in his account be e&s;teemed the fir&s;t.</P>

213. The vivifying luminous aether exi&s;ts in all
places, even the darke&s;t caverns, as is evident
from hence, that many animals &s;ee in tho&s;e dark
places, and that fire may be kindled in them by
the colli&s;ion or attrition of bodies. It is al&s;o
known that certain per&s;ons have fits of &s;eeing in
the dark. Tiberius was &s;aid to have this faculty
or di&s;temper. I my &s;elf knew an ingenious man
who had experienced it &s;everal times in him&s;elf.
And Doctor Willis in his tract de &s;anguinis ac|cen&s;ione
mentions another of his own knowledge.
This luminous aether or &s;pirit is therefore &s;aid by
Virgil, to nouri&s;h or cheri&s;h the innermo&s;t earth,
as well as the heavens and cele&s;tial bodies.</P>

though pre&s;ent to all things, is not neverthele&s;s

exqui&s;ite &s;trainers in the bodies of plants and ani|mals,

<P>215. It hath been thought by &s;ome ob&s;ervers
of nature, that the fine glandular ve&s;&s;els admit
from the common ma&s;s of the blood, only &s;uch
juices as are homogeneous to tho&s;e, with which
they were originally imbued. How they came to
be &s;o imbued doth not appear. But thus much
is plain; That fine tubes attract &s;luids, that the
glands are fine tubes, and that they attract very
<PB N="100" REF="99">
different juices from the common ma&s;s. The &s;ame
holds al&s;o with regard to the capillary ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">30, 31, 33, 35.</NOTE>
of vegetables, it being evident that through the
fine &s;trainers in the leaves and all over the body
of the plant, there be juices or fluids of a parti|cular
kind drawn in, and &s;eparated from the com|mon
ma&s;s of air and light. And that the mo&s;t
elaborate &s;pirit, whereon the character or di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
virtue and properties of the plant depend,
is of a luminous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">37, 43.</NOTE> and volatile nature, being
lo&s;t or e&s;caping into air or aether, from e&s;&s;ential
oils and odoriferous waters, without any &s;en&s;ible
diminution of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>216. As different kinds of &s;ecreted light or fire
produce different e&s;&s;ences, virtues, or &s;pecific pro|perties,
&s;o al&s;o different degrees of heat produce
different effects. Thus one degree of heat keeps
the blood from coagulating, and another degree
coagulates the blood. Thus a more violent fire
hath been ob&s;erved to &s;et free and carry off that
very light, which a more moderate fire had in|troduced
and fixed in the calcined regulus of an|timony.
In like manner, one kind or quantity
of this aetherial fiery &s;pirit may be congenial and
friendly to the &s;pirits of a man, while another
may be noxious.</P>
<P>217. And experience &s;heweth this to be true.
For the fermented &s;pirit of wine or other liquors
produceth irregular motions, and &s;ub&s;equent de|pre&s;&s;ions
in the animal &s;pirits. Whereas the lu|minous
&s;pirit lodged and detained in the native bal|&s;am
of pines and firs, is of a nature &s;o mild and
benign and proportioned to the human con&s;titution,
as to warm without heating, to cheer but not ine|briates,
<PB N="101" REF="100">
and to produce a calm and &s;teady joy like the
effect of good news, without that &s;inking of &s;pirits
which is a &s;ub&s;equent effect of all $ermented cor|dials.
I may add, without all other inconvenience,
except that it may like any other medicine be taken
in too great a quantity for too nice a &s;tomach. In
which ca&s;e it may be right, to le&s;&s;en the do&s;e, or
to take it only once in the four and twenty hours,
empty, going to bed (when it is found to be lea&s;t
offen&s;ive,) or even to &s;u&s;pend the taking of it for
a time, till nature &s;hall &s;eem to crave it, and re|joice
in it's benign and comfortable &s;pirit.</P>
<P>218. Tar water &s;erving as a vehicle to this &s;pirit
is both diuretic and diaphoretic, but &s;eems to work
it's principal effect by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the vis vitae, as an
alterative and cordial, enabling nature by an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of congenial &s;pirit, to a&s;&s;imilate that which
could not be a&s;&s;imilated by her proper force, and
&s;o to &s;ubdue the fomes morbi. And this &s;hould
&s;eem in mo&s;t ca&s;es the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e. Great
evacuations weaken nature as well as the di&s;ea&s;e.
And it is to be feared that they who u&s;e &s;aliva|tions

&s;hould recover of the di&s;temper, in their whole
life be never able to recover of the remedies.</P>
<P>219. It is true indeed, that in chronical ca&s;es
there is need of time to compleat a cure, and yet
I have known this tar water in di&s;orders of the
lungs and &s;tomach to prove a very &s;peedy remedy,
and to allay the anxiety and heat of a fever in an
in&s;tant, giving ea&s;e and &s;pirits to the patient.
This I have often experienced, not without &s;ur|pri&s;e
at &s;eeing the&s;e &s;alutary effects follow &s;o im|mediately

concerning the nature of fire.</P>
<P>221. Sir I&s;aac Newton in his optics, asks; Is
not fire a body heated &s;o hot as to emit light
copiou&s;ly? for what el&s;e, adds he, is a red hot
iron than fire? Now it &s;hould &s;eem, that to de|fine
fire by heat, would be to explain a thing by it
&s;elf. A body heated so hot as to emit light is an
ignited body, that is, hath fire in it, is penetra|ted
and agitated by fire, but is not it &s;elf fire.
And although it &s;hould in the third foregoing ac|ceptation,
or vulgar sen&s;e pa&s;s for fire, yet it is
not the pure elementary<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">190.</NOTE> fire in the &s;econd or

force, or power of burning, de&s;troying, calcining,
melting, vitrifying, and rai&s;ing the perceptions
of light and heat. This is truly and really in the
incorporeal agent, and not in the vital &s;pirit of
the univer&s;e. Motion, and even power in an
equivocal &s;en&s;e, may be found in this pure aethe|real
&s;pirit, which ignites bodies, but is not it &s;elf
the ignited body, being an in&s;trument or medium

222. It hath been &s;hewed in &s;ir I&s;aac New|ton's
optics, that light is not reflected by imping|ing
on bodies, but by &s;ome other cau&s;e. And to
him it &s;eems probable, that as many rays as im|pinge
on the &s;olid parts of bodies, are not re|flected
but &s;tifled and retained in the bodies. And
it is certain, the great poro&s;ity of all known bodies
affords room for much of this light or $ire to be
lodged therein. Gold it &s;elf the mo&s;t &s;olid of all
metals, &s;eems to have far more pores than &s;olid
parts, from water being pre&s;&s;ed through it in the
Florentine experiment, from magnetic effluvia
pa&s;&s;ing, and from mercury entering it's pores &s;o
freely. And it is admitted that water though im|po&s;&s;ible
to be compre&s;sed hath at lea&s;t &s;orty times
more pores than &s;olid parts. And as acid par|ticles,
joined with tho&s;e of earth in certain pro|portions,
are &s;o clo&s;ely united with them, as to
be quite hid and lo&s;t to all appearance, as in mer|curius
dulcis and common &s;ulphur, &s;o al&s;o may
we conceive the particles of light or fire to be ab|&s;orbed
and latent in gro&s;&s;er bodies.</P>
<P>123. It is the opinion of &s;ir I&s;aac Newton, that
&s;omewhat unknown remains in vacuo, when the
air is exhau&s;ted. This unknown medium he calls
aether. He suppo&s;eth it to be more &s;ubtil in it's
nature, and more &s;wift in its motion, than light,
freely to pervade all bodies, and by it's immen&s;e
ela&s;ticity to be expanded throughout all the hea|vens.
It's den&s;ity is &s;uppo&s;ed greater in free and
open &s;paces, than within the pores of compact
bodies. And, in pa&s;sing from the cele&s;tial bodies
to great di&s;tances, it it &s;uppo&s;ed to grow den&s;er
and den&s;er continually; and thereby cau&s;e tho&s;e
great bodies to gravitate towards one another, and
their re&s;pective parts towards their centers, every
<PB N="104" REF="103">
body endeavouring to pa&s;s from the den&s;er parts
of the medium towards the rarer.</P>
<P>224. The extreme minutene&s;s of the parts of this
medium and the velocity of their motion, together
with it's gravity den&s;ity and ela&s;tic $orce, are
thought to qualify it for being the cau&s;e of all the
natural motions in the univer&s;e. To this cau&s;e are
a&s;cribed the gravity and cohe&s;ion of bodies. The
refraction of light is al&s;o thought to proceed, from
the different den&s;ity and ela&s;tic force of this aethe|rial
medium in different places. The vibrations of
this medium alternately concurring with, or ob|&s;tructing,
the motions of the rays of light, are
&s;uppo&s;ed to produce the fits of ea&s;y reflexion or
transmiffion. Light by the vibrations of this medi|um
is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Ani|mal
motion and &s;en&s;ation are al&s;o accounted for by
the vibrating motions of this aetherial medium, pro|pagated
through the &s;olid capillaments of the nerves.
In a word, all the phaenomena and properties of
bodies, that were before attributed to attraction,
upon later thoughts &s;eem a&s;cribed to this aether,
together with the various attractions them&s;elves.</P>
<P>225. But in the philo&s;ophy of &s;ir I&s;aac Newton;
the fits (as they are called) of ea&s;y tran&s;mission and
reflexion, &s;eem as well accounted for by vibrations
excited in bodies by the rays of light, and the re|fraction
of light by the attraction or bodies. To ex|plain
the vibrations of light by tho&s;e of a more &s;ub|til
medium, &s;eems an uncouth explication. And
gravity &s;eems not an effect of the den&s;ity and ela&s;|ticity
of aether, but rather to be produced by &s;ome
other cau&s;e; which &s;ir I&s;aac him&s;elf in&s;inuates to
have been the opinion even of tho&s;e ancients who
took vacuum, atoms, and the gravity of atoms for
the principles of their philo&s;ophy, tacitly attri|buting
<PB N="105" REF="104">
(as he well ob&s;erves) gravity to &s;ome o|ther
cau&s;e di&s;tinct from matter, from atoms and,
con&s;equently, from that homogeneous aether or
ela&s;tic fluid. The ela&s;ticity of which fluid is sup|po&s;ed
to depend upon, to be defined and mea&s;ured
by it's den&s;ity; and this by the quantity of mat|ter
in one particle, multiplied by the number of
particles contained in a given &s;pace; and the quan|tity
of matter in any one particle or body of a
given &s;ize to be determined by it's gravity. Should
not therefore gravity &s;eem the original property
and fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed? On the other hand, if force
be con&s;idered as pre&s;cinded from gravity and mat|ter,
and as exi&s;ting only in points or centers, what
can this amount to but an ab&s;tract &s;piritual incor|poreal
force?</P>
<P>226. It doth not &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary from the phae|nomena,
to &s;uppo&s;e any medium more active and
&s;ubtil than light or fire. Light being allowed to
move at the rate of about ten millions of miles in
a minute, what occa&s;ion is there to conceive ano|ther
medium of &s;till &s;maller and more moveable
parts. Light or fire &s;eems the &s;ame with aether.
So the ancients under&s;tood, and &s;o the Greek
word implies. It perv$des all things<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">157.</NOTE>, is every
where pre&s;ent. And this &s;ame &s;ubtil medium ac|cording
to it's various quantities, motions, and
determinations, &s;heweth it&s;elf in different effects
or appearances, and is aether, light, or fire.</P>
<P>227. The Particles of aether fly a&s;under with
the greate&s;t force, therefore when united they
mu&s;t (according to the Newtonian doctrine) at|tract
each other with the greate&s;t force; therefore
they are acids<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">130.</NOTE>, or con&s;titute the acid; but
this united with earthy parts maketh alkali, as &s;ir
I&s;aac teacheth in his tract de acido; alkali, as ap|pears
<PB N="106" REF="105">
in cantharides and lixivial &s;alts, is a cau&s;tic;
cau&s;tics are fire; therefore acid is fire; therefore
aether is fire; and if fire, light. We are not
therefore obliged to admit a new medium di&s;tinct
from light, and of a finer and more exqui&s;ite
&s;ub&s;tance, for the explication of phaenomena,
which appear to be as well explained without
it. How can the den&s;ity or ela&s;ticity of aether
account for the rapid flight of a ray of light from
the Sun, &s;till &s;wifter as it goes farther from the
&s;un? or how can it account for the various mo|tions
and attractions of different bodies? Why
oyl and water, mercury and iron repell, or why
other bodies attract each other? or why a parti|cle
of light &s;hould repell on one &s;ide and attract
on the other, as in the ca&s;e of the I&s;landic cry|&s;tal?
To explain cohe&s;ion by hamate atoms is ac|counted
ignotum per ignotius. And is it not as
much &s;o to account for the gravity of bodies by
the ela&s;ticity of aether?</P>
<P>228. It is one thing to arrive at general laws
of nature from a contemplation of the phaenome|na;
and another to frame an hypothe&s;is, and
from thence deduce the phaenomena. Tho&s;e who
&s;uppo&s;ed epicycles, and by them explained the
motions and appearances of the planets, may not
therefore be thought to have di&s;covered principles
true in fact and nature. And albeit we may from
the premi&s;es infer a conclu&s;ion, it will not follow,
that we can argue reciprocally, and from the
conclu&s;ion infer the premi&s;es. For in&s;tance,
&s;uppo&s;ing an ela&s;tic fluid, who&s;e con&s;tituent mi|nute
particles are equidi&s;tant from each other and
of equal den&s;ities and diameters, and recede one
from another with a centrifugal force which is in|ver&s;ly
as the di&s;tance of the centers, and admit|ting
that from &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition it mu&s;t follow,
<PB N="107" REF="106">
that the den&s;ity and ela&s;tic force of &s;uch fluid are
in the inver&s;e proportion of the &s;pace it occupies
when compre&s;&s;ed by any force; yet we cannot re|ciprocally
infer, that a fluid endued with this pro|perty
mu&s;t therefore consi&s;t of &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed equal
particles; for it would then follow, that the con|&s;tituent
particles of air were of equal den&s;ities and
diameters; whereas it is certain, that air is an he|terogeneous
ma&s;s, containing in it's compo&s;ition
an infinite variety of exhalations, from the dif|ferent
bodies which make up this terraqueous
globe.</P>
<P>229. The phaenomena of light, animal &s;pirit,
mu&s;cular motion, fermentation, vegetation, and
other natural operations, &s;eem to require no|thing
more than the intellectual and artificial fire
of Heraclitus, Hippocrates, the Stoics<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">166, 168.</NOTE>, and
other antients. Intellect, &s;uperadded to aetherial &s;pi|rit,
fire, or light, moves, and moves regularly,
proceeding, in a method as the Stoics, or increa&s;|ing
and dimini&s;hing by mea&s;ure, as Heraclitus
expre&s;sed it. The Stoics held that Fire compre|hended
and included the &s;permatic rea&s;ons or forms
(<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) of all natural things. As the
forms of things have their ideal exi&s;tence in the
intellect, &s;o it &s;hould &s;eem that &s;eminal principles
have their natural exi&s;tence in the light<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">164.</NOTE>, a me|dium
con&s;i&s;ting of heterogeneous parts, differing
from each other in divers qualities that appear to
&s;en&s;e, and not improbably having many original
properties, attractions, repul&s;ions and motions,
the laws and natures whereof are indi&s;cernible to
us, otherwi&s;e than in their remote effects. And
this animated heterogeneous fire &s;hould &s;eem a
more adequate cau&s;e, whereby to explain the phae|nomena
<PB N="108" REF="107">
of nature, than one uniform aetherial me|dium.</P>
<P>230. A$$&s;totle indeed excepts again&s;t the ele|ments
being animated. Yet nothing hinders why
that power of the &s;oul, &s;tyled by him <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
or locomotive, may not re&s;ide therein, under the
direction of an intellect, in &s;uch &s;en&s;e and as
properly as it is &s;aid to re&s;ide in animal bodies.
It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be owned, that albeit that
philo&s;opher acknowledgeth a divine force or ener|gy
in fire, yet to &s;ay that fire is alive, or that
having a &s;oul it &s;hould not be alive, &s;eem to him
equally ab&s;urd. See his &s;econd bock, de parti|bus
animalium.</P>
<P>231. The laws of attraction and repul&s;ion are
to be regarded as laws of motion, and the&s;e only
as rules or methods ob&s;erved in the productions of
natural effects, the efficient and final cau&s;es where|of
are not of mechanical con&s;ideration. Certain|ly,
if the explaining a phaenomenon be to a&s;|&s;ign
it's proper efficient and final cau&s;e<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">154, 155, 160.</NOTE>, it
&s;hould &s;eem the mechanical philo&s;ophers never
explained any thing; their province being only to
di&s;cover the laws of nature, that is the general
rules and methods of motion, and to account for
particular phaenomena by reducing them under,
or &s;hewing their conformity to &s;uch general rules.</P>
<P>232. Some corpu&s;cularian philo&s;ophers of the
la&s;t age, have indeed attempted to explain the for|mation
of this world and it's phaenomena, by a few
&s;imple laws of mechani&s;m. But if we con&s;ider
the various productions of nature, in the mine|ral,
vegetable and animal parts of the creation,
I believe we &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to affirm, that not any
<PB N="109" REF="108">
one of them has hitherto been, or can be account|ed
for on principles merely mechanical; and that
nothing could be more vain and imaginary, than
to &s;uppo&s;e with De&s;cartes, that merely from cir|cular
motions being impre&s;sed by the &s;upreme
agent on the particles of extended &s;ub&s;tance, the
whole world with all it's &s;everal parts, appurte|nances,
and phaenomena might be produced, by
a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from the laws of mo|tion.</P>
<P>233. Others &s;uppo&s;e that God did more at the
beginning, having then made the &s;eeds of all ve|getables
and animals, containing their &s;olid or|ganical
parts in miniature, the gradual filling and
evolution of which, by the influx of proper juices,
doth con&s;titute the generation and growth of a
living body. So that the artificial &s;tructure of
plants and animals daily generated, requires no
pre&s;ent exerci&s;e of art to produce it, having been
already framed at the origin of the world, which
with all it's parts hath ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted going
like a clock or machine by it&s;elf, according to
the laws of nature, without the immediate hand
of the arti&s;t. But how can this hypothe&s;is explain
the blended features of different &s;pecies in mules
and other mongrels? or the parts added or changed,
and &s;ometimes whole limbs lo&s;t by marking in
the womb? or how can it account for the re&s;ur|rection
of a tree from it's &s;tump, or the vegeta|tive
power in it's cuttings? in which ca&s;es we mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily conceive &s;omething more than the mere
evolution of a &s;eed.</P>
<P>234. Mechanical laws of nature or motion di|rect
us how to act, and teach us what to expect.
Where intellect pre&s;ides, there will be method and
order, and therefore rules, which if not &s;tated
<PB N="110" REF="109">
and con&s;tant would cea&s;e to be rules. There is
therefore a con&s;tancy in things, which is &s;tyled
the cour&s;e of nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">160.</NOTE>. All the phaenomena in
nature are produced by motion. There appears an
uniform working in things great and &s;mall, by
attracting and repelling forces. But the particu|lar
laws of attraction and repul&s;ion are various.
Nor are we concerned at all about the forces, nei|ther
can we know or mea&s;ure them otherwi&s;e than
by their effect, that is to &s;ay the motions, which
motions only, and not the forces, are indeed in
the bodies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">155.</NOTE>. Bodies are moved to or from each
other, and this is performed according to different
laws. The natural or mechanic philo&s;opher en|deavours
to di&s;cover tho&s;e laws by experiment and
rea&s;oning. But what is &s;aid of forces re&s;iding in
bodies whether attracting or repelling, is to be
regarded only as a mathematical hypothe&s;is, and
not as any thing really exi&s;ting in nature.</P>
<P>235. We are not therefore &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;uppo&s;e
with certain mechanic philo&s;ophers, that the mi|nute
particles of bodies have real forces or powers
by which they Act on each other, to produce the
various phaenomena in nature. The minute cor|pu&s;cles
are impelled and directed, that is to &s;ay,
moved to and from each other according to various
rules or laws of motion. The laws of gravity,
magneti&s;m, and electricity are divers. And it
is not known, what other different rules or laws
of motion might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the author of
nature. Some bodies approach together, others
fly a&s;under, and perhaps &s;ome others do neither.
When &s;alt of tartar flows per deliquium, it is vi|&s;ible
that the particles of water floating in the air
<PB N="111" REF="110">
are moved towards the particles of &s;alt, and joined
with them. And when we behold vulgar &s;alt not
to flow per deliquium, may we not conclude that
the &s;ame law of nature and motion doth not ob|tain
between it's particles and tho&s;e of the floating
vapours? A drop of water a&s;&s;umes a round figure,
becau&s;e it's parts are moved towards each other.
But the particles of oil and vinegar have no &s;uch
di&s;po&s;ition to unite. And when flies walk in wa|ter
without wetting their feet, it is attributed
to a repelling force or faculty in the fly's feet.
But this is ob&s;ure, though the phaenomenon be
plain.</P>
<P>236. It is not improbable, and &s;eems not un|&s;upported
by experiments, that, as in algebra,
where po&s;itive quantities cea&s;e there negative begin,
even &s;o in mechanics, where attracting forces cea&s;e
there repelling forces begin: or (to expre&s;s it more
properly) where bodies cea&s;e to be moved towards,
they begin to be moved from each other. This
&s;ir I&s;aac Newton infers from the production of air
and vapours, who&s;e particles fly a&s;under with &s;uch
vehement force. We behold iron move towards
the load&s;tone, &s;traws towards amber, heavy bodies
towards the earth. The laws of the&s;e motions are
various. And when it is &s;aid, that all the motions
and changes in the great world ari&s;e from attraction;
the elacticity of the air, the motion of water, the
de&s;cent of heavy, and the a&s;cent of light bodies,
being all a&s;cribed to the &s;ame principle; when from
in&s;en&s;ible attractions of mo&s;t minute particles at
the &s;malle&s;t di&s;tance, are derived cohefion, di&s;&s;o|lution,
coagulation, animal &s;ecretion, fermenta|tion,
and all chemical operations; and when it is
&s;aid, that with out &s;uch principles there never would
have been any motion in the world, and without
<PB N="112" REF="111">
the continuance thereof all motion would cea&s;e. In
all this we know or under&s;tand no more, than
that bodies are moved according to a certain order,
and that they do not move them&s;elves,</P>
<P>237. So likewi&s;e, how to explain all tho&s;e vari|ous
motions and effects, by the den&s;ity and ela&s;ti|city
of aether, &s;eems incomprehen&s;ible<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">153, 162.</NOTE>. For
in&s;tance, why &s;hould the acid particles draw tho&s;e
of water and repell each other? why &s;hould &s;ome
&s;alts attract vapours in the air, and others not?
why &s;hould the particles of common &s;alt repell
each other, &s;o as not to &s;ub&s;ide in water? why
&s;hould the mo&s;t repellent particles be the mo&s;t at|tractive
upon contact? Or why &s;hould the re|pellent
begin where the attractive faculty leaves
off. The&s;e, and numberle&s;s other effects &s;een in|explicable
on mechanical principles, or otherwi&s;e
than by recour&s;e to a mind or &s;piritual agent<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">154, 220.</NOTE>. Nor will it &s;uffice from pre&s;ent phaenomena and
effects, through a chain of natural cau&s;es, and
&s;ubordinate blind agents, to trace a divine in|tellect
as the remote original cau&s;e, that fir&s;t crea|ted
the world, and then &s;et it a going. We can|not
make even one &s;ingle &s;tep in accounting for
the phaenomena, without admitting the immedi|ate
pre&s;ence and immediate action of an incorpo|real
agent, who connects, moves, and di&s;po&s;es
all things, according to &s;uch rules, and for &s;uch
purpo&s;es as &s;eem good to him.</P>
<P>238. It is an old opinion adopted by the moderns,
that the elements and other natural bodies are
changed each into other<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">148.</NOTE>. Now, as the particles
of different bodies are agitated by di$ferent forces,
attracting and repelling, or, to &s;peak more accurate|ly,
are moved by different laws, how can the&s;e forces
<PB N="113" REF="112">
or laws be changed, and this change accounted for
by an ela&s;tic aether? Such a medium di&s;tinct from
light or fire &s;eemeth not to be made out by an$
proof, nor to be of any u&s;e in explaining the
phaenomena. But if there be any medium em|ployed,
as a &s;ubordinate cau&s;e or in&s;trument in
attraction, it would rather &s;eem to be light<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">152, 156.</NOTE>;
&s;ince by an experiment of Mr. Boyle's, amber, that
&s;hewed no &s;ign of attraction in the &s;hade, being
placed where the &s;un-beams &s;hone upon it, imme|diately
attracted light bodies. Be&s;ides, it hath been
di&s;covered by &s;ir I&s;aac Newton, and an admirable
di&s;covery it was, that light is an heterogeneous me|dium
<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">40, 181.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of particles endued with ori|ginal
di&s;tinct properties. And upon the&s;e, if I may
venture to give my conjectures, it &s;eemeth probable
the &s;pecific properties of bodies, and the force of
&s;pecific medicines may depend. Different &s;ides of
the &s;ame ray &s;hall, one approach and the other re|cede
from the I&s;landic Cry&s;tal; can this be account|ed
for by the ela&s;ticity of a fine medium, or by the
general laws of motion, or by any mechanical prin|ciples
whatever? And if not, what &s;hould hinder
but there may be &s;pecific medicines, who&s;e opera|tion
depends not upon mechanical principles, how
much &s;oever that notion hath been exploded of late
years?</P>
<P>239. Why may we not &s;uppo&s;e certain idio&s;yn|cra&s;ies,
&s;ympathies, oppo&s;itions, in the &s;olids or
fluids or animal &s;pirit of a human body, with re|gard
to the fine in&s;en&s;ible parts of minerals or ve|getables,
impregnated by rays of light of different
properties, not depending on the different &s;ize,
figure, number, &s;olidity or weight of tho&s;e particles,
<PB N="114" REF="113">
nor on the general laws of motion, nor on the den|&s;ity
or ela&s;ticity of a medium, but merely and a$
together on the good plea&s;ure of the Creator, in th$
original formation of things? From whence diver$
unaccountable and unfore&s;een motions may ari&s;e i$
the animal oeconomy; from whence al&s;o variou$
peculiar and &s;pecific virtues may be conceived t$
ari&s;e, re&s;iding in certain medicines, and not to b$
explained by mechanical principles. For althoug$
the general known laws of motion are to be deem$ed
mechanical, yet peculiar motions of the in&s;en&s;ibl$
parts, and peculiar properties depending thereon$
are occult and &s;pecific.</P>
<P>240. The words attraction and repul&s;ion may, i$
compliance with cu&s;tom, be u&s;ed where, accurately
&s;peaking, motion alone is meant. And in that &s;en&s;e
it may be &s;aid, that peculiar attractions or repul&s;ion$
in the parts, are attended with &s;pecific properties i$
the wholes. The particles of light are vehement|ly
moved to or from, retained or rejected by objects.
Which is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay with &s;ir I&s;aac
Newton, that the particles of acids are endued with
great attractive force<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">202.</NOTE>, wherein their activity
con&s;i&s;ts; whence fermentation and di&s;&s;olution; and
that the mo&s;t repellent are, upon contact, the mo&s;t
attracting particles.</P>
<P>241. Gravity and fermentation are received for
two mo&s;t exten&s;ive principles. From fermentation
are derived the motion and warmth of the hear$
and blood in animals, &s;ubterraneous heat, fires, and
earthquakes, meteors and changes in the atmo|&s;phere.
And, that attracting and repelling force$
operate in the nutrition and di&s;&s;olution or animal
and vegetable bodies, is the doctrine both of Hip|pocrates
<PB N="115" REF="114">
and &s;ir I&s;aac Newton. The former of
the&s;e celebrated authors, in his treati&s;e concerning
diet or regimen, ob&s;erves, that in the nouri&s;hment
of man, one part repells and another attracts.
And again in the &s;ame treati&s;e two carpenters,
&s;aith he, &s;aw a piece of timber; one draws, the
other pu&s;hes: the&s;e two actions tend to one and the
&s;ame end, though in a contrary direction, one up,
the other down: This imitates the nature of man:
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>242. It is the general maxim of Hippocrates, that
the manner wherein nature acts con&s;i&s;teth in attract|ing
what is meet and good, and in repelling
what is di&s;agreeable or hurtful. He makes the
whole of the animal oeconomy to be admini&s;tred by
the faculties or powers of nature. Nature alone,
&s;aith he, &s;ufficeth for all things to animals. She
knows of her&s;elf what is nece&s;&s;ary for them.
Whence it is plain, he means a con&s;cious intelligent
nature, that pre&s;ides and moves the aetherial &s;pi|rit.
And though he declares all things are accom|pli&s;hed
on man by nece&s;&s;ity, yet it is not a blind
fate or chain of mere corporeal cau&s;es, but a divine
nece&s;&s;ity, as he him&s;elf expre&s;ly calls it. And what
is this but an over-ruling intelligent power that di&s;|po&s;eth
of all things?</P>
<P>243. Attraction cannot produce, and in that
&s;en&s;e account for the phaenomena, being it&s;elf one
of the phaenomena produced and to be accounted
for<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">160, 235.</NOTE>. Attraction is performed by different laws,
and cannot therefore in all ca&s;es be the effect of the
ela&s;ticity of one uniform medium. The phaenome|na
of electrical bodies, the laws and variations of
magneti&s;m, and, not to mention other kinds, even
<PB N="116" REF="115">
Gravity, is not explained by ela&s;ticity, a phaeno|menon
not le&s;s ob&s;cure than it&s;elf. But then, al|though
it &s;hew not the agent, yet it &s;heweth a rule
and analogy in nature, to &s;ay, That the &s;olid parts
of animals are endued with attractive powers, where|by
from contiguous fluids they draw like to like; and
that glands have peculiar powers attractive of pe|culiar
juices<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">41.</NOTE>. Nature &s;eems better known and
explained by attractions and repul&s;ions, than by
tho&s;e other mechanical principles of &s;ize, figure, and
the like: that is by &s;ir I&s;aac Newton, than De&s;|cartes.
And natural philo&s;ophers excell, as they
are more or le&s;s acquainted with the laws and me|thods
ob&s;erved by the author of nature.</P>
<P>244. The &s;ize and &s;hape of particles and general
laws of motion can never explain the &s;ecretions
without the help of attraction, ob&s;cure perhaps as
to it's cau&s;e, but clear as a law. Numberle&s;s in|&s;tances
of this might be given: Lemery the young|er
thought him&s;elf obliged to &s;uppo&s;e, the particles
of light or fire (contrary to all rea&s;on) to be of a
very gro&s;s kind, even greater than the pores of
the burnt lime&s;tone, in order to account for their
being detained or impri&s;oned therein; but this phae|nomenon
is ea&s;ily reduced to attraction. There
would be no end of enumerating the like ca&s;es.
The activity and force of aetherial &s;pirit or fire by
the laws of attraction, is imparted to gro&s;&s;er par|ticles
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">152, 163.</NOTE>, and thereby wonderfully &s;upports the
oeconomy of living bodies. By &s;uch peculiar com|po&s;itions
and attractions it &s;eems to be effected,
that den&s;er fluids can pa&s;s where air it&s;elf cannot,
(as oyl through leather) and therefore th$ough
<PB N="117" REF="116">
the nice&s;t and fine&s;t &s;trainers of an animal or vege|table.</P>
<P>245. The ancients had &s;ome general conception of
attracting and repelling powers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">241, 242.</NOTE> as natural princi|ples.
Galilaei had particularly con&s;idered the attrac|tion
of gravity, and made &s;ome di&s;covery of the
laws thereof. But &s;ir I&s;aac Newton by his &s;ingu|lar
penetration, profound knowledge in geometry
and mechanics, and great exactne&s;s in experiments,
hath ca&s;t a new light on natural &s;cience. The laws
of attraction and repul&s;ion were in many in&s;tances
di&s;covered, and fir&s;t di&s;covered, by him. He
&s;hewed their general extent, and therewith as with
a key opened &s;everal deep &s;ecrets of nature, in the
knowledge whereof he &s;eems to have made a grea|ter
progre&s;s, than all the &s;ects of corpu&s;cularians
together had done before him. Neverthele&s;s, the
principle of attraction it&s;elf is not to be explained
by phy&s;ical or corporeal cau&s;es.</P>
<P>246. The Carte&s;ians attempted to explain it
by the ni$us of a &s;ubtil element, receding from the
center of its motion, and impelling gro&s;ser bodies
towards it. Sir I&s;aac Newton in his later thoughts
&s;eems (as was before ob&s;erved) to have adopted
&s;omewhat not altogether foreign from this notion,
a&s;cribing that to his ela&s;tic medium<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">237, 238.</NOTE> which De&s;|cartes
did to his &s;econd element. But the great
men of antiquity re&s;olved gravity into the immediate
action of an intelligent incorporeal being. To which
al&s;o &s;ir I&s;aac Newton him&s;elf atte&s;ts and &s;ub&s;cribes,
although he may perhaps &s;ometimes be thought to
forget him&s;elf, in his manner of &s;peaking of phy|&s;ical
agents, which in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e are none at all;
and in &s;uppo&s;ing real forces to exi&s;t in bodies, in
<PB N="118" REF="117">
which, to &s;peak truly, attraction and repul&s;ion
&s;hould be con&s;idered only as tendencies or motions,
that is, as mere effects, and their laws as laws of
motion.</P>
<P>247. Though it be &s;uppo&s;ed the chief bu&s;ine&s;s
of a natural philo&s;opher to trace out cau&s;es from
the effects, yet this is to be under&s;tood not of
agents<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">155.</NOTE> but of principles, that is, of component
parts, in one &s;en&s;e, or of laws or rules, in another.
In &s;trict truth all agents are incorporeal, and as &s;uch
are not properly of phy&s;ical con&s;ideration. The
A&s;tronomer, therefore, the Mechanic, or the Chy|mi&s;t,
not as &s;uch, but by accident only, treat of
real cau&s;es, agents or efficients. Neither doth it
&s;eem, as is &s;uppo&s;ed by the greate&s;t of mechanical
philo&s;ophers, that the true way of proceeding in
their &s;cience is, from known motions in nature to
inve&s;tigate the moving forces. Fora&s;much as force
is neither corporeal, nor belongs to any corporeal
thing<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">220.</NOTE>; nor yet to be di&s;covered by experiments
or mathematical rea&s;onings, which reach no farther
than di&s;cernible effects, and motions in things pa&s;&s;ive
and moved.</P>
<P>248. Vis or force is to the &s;oul, what exten&s;ion
is to the body, &s;aith Saint Augu&s;tin, in his tract
concerning the quantity of the &s;oul; and without
force there is nothing done or made, and con&s;equent|ly
there can be no agent. Authority is not to de|cide
in this ca&s;e. Let any one con&s;ult his own no|tions
and rea&s;on, as well as experience, concerning
the origine of motion, and the re&s;pective natures,
properties, and differences of &s;oul and body, and he
will, if I mi&s;take not, evidently perceive, that there
is nothing active in the later. Nor are they natural
<PB N="119" REF="118">
agents or corporeal forces, which make the parti|cles
of bodies to cohaere. Nor is it the bu&s;ine&s;s of
experimental philo&s;ophers to find them out.</P>
<P>249. The mechanical philo&s;opher, as hath been
already ob&s;erved, inquires properly concerning the
rules and modes of operation alone, and not con|cerning
the cau&s;e, fora&s;much as nothing mechanical
is or really can be a cau&s;e<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">236, 247.</NOTE>. And although a
mechanical or mathematical philo&s;opher may &s;peak
of ab&s;olute &s;pace, ab&s;olute motion, and of force as
exi&s;ting in bodies, cau&s;ing &s;uch motion and pro|portional
thereto; yet what the&s;e forces are, which
are &s;uppo&s;ed to be lodged in bodies, to be impre&s;&s;ed
on bodies, to be multiplied, divided, and commu|nicated
from one body to another, and which &s;eem
to animate bodies like ab&s;tract &s;pirits or &s;ouls, hath
been found very difficult, not to &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible, for
thinking men to conceive and explain, as may be
&s;een by con&s;ulting Borellus de vi percu&s;&s;ionis, and
Torricelli in his lezioni academiche, among other
authors.</P>
<P>250. Nor, if we con&s;ider the proclivity of man|kind
to realize their notions, will it &s;eem &s;trange
that mechanic philo&s;ophers and Geometricians &s;hould,
like other men, be mi&s;led by prejudice, and take
mathematical hypothe&s;es for real beings exi&s;ting in
bodies, &s;o far as even to make it the very aim and
end of their &s;cience to compute or mea&s;ure tho&s;e
phantomes; whereas it is very certain that nothing
in truth can be mea&s;ured<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject is handled at large in my Latin tract de motu, publi&s;hed above twenty years ago.</NOTE> or computed, be&s;ide the
very effects or motions them&s;elves. Sir I&s;aac New|ton
a&s;ks, have not the minute particles of bodies
certain forces or powers by which they act on
<PB N="120" REF="119">
one another, as well as on the particles of light,
for producing mo&s;t of the phaenomena in nature?
But in reality, tho&s;e minute particles are only agi|tated
according to certain laws of nature, by &s;ome
other agent, wherein the force exi&s;ts and not in
them, which have only the motion; which motion
in the body moved, the Peripatetics rightly judge
to be a mere pa&s;&s;ion, but in the mover to be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
or act.</P>
<P>251. It pa&s;&s;eth with many, I know not how,
that mechanical principles give a clear &s;olution of the
phaenomena. The Democritic hypothe&s;is, &s;aith
Doctor Cudworth, doth much more hand&s;omely
and intelligibly &s;olve the phaenomena, than that of
Ari&s;totle and Plato. But things rightly con&s;idered,
perhaps it will be found not to &s;olve any phaenome|non
at all. For all phaenomena are, to &s;peak tru|ly,
appearances in the &s;oul or mind; and it hath
never been explained, nor can it be explained, how
external bodies, figures and motions &s;hould pro|duce
an appearance in the mind. Tho&s;e principles,
therefore, do not &s;olve, if by &s;olving is meant a&s;&s;ign|ing
the real, either efficient or final cau&s;e of appear|ances,
but only reduce them to general rules.</P>
<P>252. There is a certain analogy, con&s;tancy, and
uniformity in the phaenomena or appearances of na|ture,
which are a foundation for general rules: and
the&s;e are a grammar for the under&s;tanding of na|ture,
or that &s;eries of effects in the vi&s;ible world,
whereby we are enabled to fore&s;ee what will come
to pa&s;s, in the natural cour&s;e of things. Plotinus
ob&s;erves, in his third Ennead, that the art of pre|&s;aging
is in &s;ome &s;ort the reading of natural letters
denoting order, and that &s;o far forth as analogy ob|tains
in the univer&s;e, there may be vaticination.
And in reality, he that foretells the motions of the
<PB N="121" REF="120">
planets, or the effects of medicines, or the re&s;ult,
of chymical or mechanical experiments, may be &s;aid
to do it by natural vaticination.</P>
<P>253. We know a thing when we under&s;tand it:
and we under&s;tand it, when we can interpret or tell
what it &s;ignifies. Strictly the &s;en&s;e knows nothing.
We perceive indeed &s;ounds by hearing, and charac|ters
by &s;ight: but we are not therefore &s;aid to un|der&s;tand
them. After the &s;ame manner, the phae|nomena
of nature are alike vi&s;ible to all: but all
have not alike learned the connexion of natural
things, or under&s;tand what they &s;ignify, or know
how to vaticinate by them. There is no que&s;tion,
&s;aith Socrates, in Theaeteto, concerning that which
is agreeable to each per&s;on; but concerning what
will in time to come be agreeable, of which all men
are not equally judges. He who foreknoweth what
will be in every kind, is the wi&s;e&s;t. According to
Socrates, you and the cook may judge of a di&s;h on
the table equally well; but while the di&s;h is making,
the cook can better foretell what will en&s;ue from
this or that manner of compo&s;ing it. Nor is this
manner of rea&s;oning confined only to morals or po|litics;
but extends al&s;o to natural &s;cience.</P>
<P>254. As the natural connexion of &s;igns with the
things &s;ignified is regular and con&s;tant, it forms a
&s;ort of rational di&s;cour&s;e<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">152.</NOTE>, and is therefore the
immediate effect of an intelligent cau&s;e. This is
agreeable to the philo&s;ophy of Plato and other an|cients.
Plotinus indeed &s;aith, that which acts natu|rally
is not intellection, but a certain power of mov|ing
matter, which doth not know but only do.
And it mu&s;t be owned, that, as faculties are multi|plied
by philo&s;ophers according to their operations,
the will may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the intellect.
<PB N="122" REF="121">
But it will not therefore follow, that the will, which
operates in the cour&s;e of nature, is not conducted
and applied by intellect, although it be granted that
neither will under&s;tands, nor intellect wills. There|fore,
the phaenomena of nature, which &s;trike on
the &s;en&s;es and are under&s;tood by the mind, do form
not only a magnificent &s;pectacle, but al&s;o a mo&s;t
coherent, entertaining, and in&s;tructive di&s;cour&s;e;
and to effect this, they are conducted, adju&s;ted, and
ranged by the greate&s;t wi&s;dom. This language or
di&s;cour&s;e is &s;tudied with different attention, and in|terpreted
with different degrees of &s;kill. But &s;o far
as men have &s;tudied and remarked it's rules, and
can interpret right, &s;o far they may be &s;aid to be
knowing in nature. A bea&s;t is like a man who
hears a &s;trange tongue, but under&s;tands nothing.</P>
<P>255. Nature, &s;aith the learned Doctor Cud|worth,
is not ma&s;ter of art or wi&s;dom: Nature is
ratio mer&s;a &amp; confu&s;a, rea&s;on immer&s;ed and plung|ed
into matter, and as it were fuddled in it and con|founded
with it. But the formation of plants and
animals, the motions of natural bodies; their vari|ous
properties, appearances and vici&s;&s;itudes, in a
word the whole &s;eries of things in this vi&s;ible world,
which we call the cour&s;e of nature, is so wi&s;ely
managed and carried on, that the mo&s;t improved
human Rea&s;on cannot thoroughly comprehend even
the lea&s;t particle thereof; &s;o far is it from &s;eeming
to $word$ produced by fuddled or confounded rea&s;on.</P>
<P>2$$. Natural productions, it is true, are not all
equal$$ perfect. But neither doth it &s;uit with the
order $word$ $hings, the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e, or
the end&punc; $word$ providence that they &s;hould be &s;o.
General $word$ we have &s;een<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">24$ $word$.</NOTE>, are nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="123" REF="122">
make the world intelligible: and from the con&s;tant
ob&s;ervation of &s;uch rules, natural evils will &s;ome|times
unavoidably en&s;ue: things will be produced
in a &s;low length of time, and arrive at different de|grees
of perfection.</P>
<P>257. It mu&s;t be owned, we are not con&s;cious of
the &s;y&s;tole and dia&s;tole of the heart, or the motion
of the diaphragm. It may not neverthele&s;s be
thence inferred, that unknowing nature can act re|gularly,
as well as our&s;elves. The true inference
is, that the &s;elf, thinking individual, or humane per|&s;on,
is not the real author of tho&s;e natural motions.
And in fact no man blames him&s;elf if they are
wrong, or values him&s;elf if they are right. The &s;ame
may be &s;aid of the fingers of a mu&s;ician, which
&s;ome object to be moved by habit which under&s;tands
not; it being evident, that what is done by rule
mu&s;t proceed from &s;omething that under&s;tands the
rule; therefore, if not from the mu&s;ician him&s;elf,
from &s;ome other active intelligence, the &s;ame per|haps
which governs bees and &s;piders, and moves
the limbs of tho&s;e who walk in their &s;leep.</P>
<P>258. In&s;truments, occa&s;ions, and &s;igns<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">160.</NOTE> do
occur in, or rather make up, the whole vi&s;ible
cour&s;e of nature. The&s;e, being no agents them|&s;elves,
are under the direction of one agent con|certing
all for one end, the &s;upreme good. All
tho&s;e motions, whether in animal bodies or in other
parts of the &s;y&s;tem of nature, which are not effects
of particular wills, &s;eem to &s;pring from the &s;ame
general cau&s;e with the vegetation of plants, an
aetherial &s;pirit actuated by a mind.</P>
<P>259. The fir&s;t Poets and Theologers of Greece
and the East con&s;idered the generation of things,
<PB N="124" REF="123">
as a&s;cribed rather to a divine cau&s;e, but the Phy&s;ici
to natural cau&s;es &s;ubordinate to, and directed &s;till
by a divine; except &s;ome Corporeali&s;ts and Me|chanics,
who vainly pretended to make a world with|out
a God. The hidden force that unites, adju&s;ts,
and cau&s;eth all things to hang together, and move
in harmony, which Orpheus and Empedocles &s;tyl|ed
love; this principle of union is no blind prin|ciple,
but acts with intellect. This divine love and
intellect are not them&s;elves obvious to our view, or
otherwi&s;e di&s;cerned than in their effects. Intellect
enlightens, Love connects, and the &s;overaign Good
attracts all things.</P>
<P>260. All things are made for the &s;upreme good,
all things tend to that end: and we may be &s;aid to
account for a thing, when we &s;hew that it is &s;o
be&s;t. In the Phaedon, Socrates declares it to be
his opinion, that he, who &s;uppo&s;ed all things to
have been di&s;po&s;ed and ordered by a mind<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154, 160</NOTE>,
&s;hould not pretend to a&s;&s;ign any other cau&s;e of
them. He blames Phy&s;iologers for attempting to
account for phaenomena, particularly for gravity
and cohae&s;ion, by vortexes and aether, overlooking
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the &s;tronge&s;t bond and
cement which holds together all the parts of the
univer&s;e, and not di&s;cerning the cau&s;e it &s;elf from
tho&s;e things which only attend it.</P>
<P>261. As in the microco&s;m, the con&s;tant regular
tenor of the motions of the vi&s;cera and contained
juices doth not hinder, particular voluntary motions
to be impre&s;&s;ed by the mind on the animal &s;pirit;
even &s;o in the mundane &s;y&s;tem, the &s;teddy ob&s;er|vance
of certain laws of nature, in the gro&s;&s;er ma&s;&s;es
and more con&s;picuous motions, doth not hinder,
<PB N="125" REF="124">
but a voluntary agent may &s;ometimes communicate
particular impre&s;&s;ions to the fine aetherial medium,
which in the world an&s;wers the animal &s;pirit in man.
Which two (if they are two) although invi&s;ible and
inconceivably &s;mall, yet &s;eem the real latent &s;prings,
whereby all the parts of this vi&s;ible world are mov|ed;
albeit they are not to be regarded as a true cau&s;e,
but only an in&s;trument of motion; and the in&s;tru|ment
not as a help to the Creator, but only as a
sign to the creature.</P>
<P>262. Plotinus &s;uppo&s;eth that the &s;oul of the uni|ver&s;e
is not the original cau&s;e or author of the &s;pe|cies,
but receives them from Intellect, the true
principle of order and di&s;tinction, the &s;ource and
giver of forms. Others con&s;ider the vegetative &s;oul
only as &s;ome lower faculty of a higher &s;oul, which
animates the fiery aetherial &s;pirit<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">178.</NOTE>. As for the
blots and defects which appear in the cour&s;e of this
world, which &s;ome have thought to proceed from
a fatality or nece&s;&s;ity in nature, and others from an
evil principle, that &s;ame philo&s;opher ob&s;erves, that
it may be the governing rea&s;on produceth and or|daineth
all tho&s;e things; and, not intending that all
parts &s;hould be equally good, maketh &s;ome wor&s;e
than others by de&s;ign, as all parts in an animal are
not eyes: And in a city, comedy, or picture, all
ranks, characters, and colours are not equal or like;
even so exce&s;&s;es, defects, and contrary qualities,
con&s;pire to the beauty and harmony of the world.</P>
<P>263. It cannot be denied, that with re&s;pect to
the univer&s;e of things, we in this mortal &s;tate are
like men educated in Plato's cave, looking on &s;ha|dows
with our backs turned to the light. But
<PB N="126" REF="125">
though our light be dim, and our &s;ituation bad,
yet if the be&s;t u&s;e be made of both, perhaps &s;ome|thing
may be &s;een. Proclus, in his commentary
on the theology of Plato, ob&s;erves there are two
&s;orts of philo&s;ophers. The one placed body fir&s;t in
the order of beings, and made the faculty of think|ing
depend thereupon, &s;uppo&s;ing that the principles
of all things are corporeal: that Body mo&s;t really
or principally exi&s;ts, and all other things in a &s;econ|dary
&s;en&s;e, and by virtue that. Others, making all
corporeal things to be dependent upon &s;oul or mind,
think this to exi&s;t in the fir&s;t place and primary
&s;en&s;e, and the being of bodies to be altogether de|rived
from, and pre&s;uppo&s;e that of the mind.</P>
<P>264. Sen&s;e and experience acquaint us, with the
cour&s;e and analogy of appearances or natural effects.
Thought, rea&s;on, intellect, introduce us into the
knowledge of their cau&s;es. Sen&s;ible appearances,
though of a flowing, un&s;table, and uncertain nature,
yet having fir&s;t occupied the mind, they do by an
early prevention, render the after ta&s;k of thought
more difficult: and as they amu&s;e the eyes and
ears, and are more &s;uited to vulgar u&s;es and the
mechanic arts of life, they ea&s;ily obtain a preference,
in the opinion of mo&s;t men, to tho&s;e superior prin|ciples,
which are the later growth of the humane
mind arrived to maturity and perfection, but, not
affecting the corporeal &s;en&s;e, are thought to be &s;o
far deficient in point of &s;olidity and reality, &s;en&s;ible
and real to common apprehen&s;ions being the &s;ame
thing. Although it be certain, that the principles of
&s;cience are neither objects of &s;en&s;e nor imagination;
and that intellect and rea&s;on are alone the &s;ure
guides to Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="126">
265. The &s;ucce&s;sful curio&s;ity of the pre&s;ent age,
in arts and experiments and new &s;y&s;tems, is apt to
elate men, and make them overlook the ancients.
But notwith&s;tanding that the encouragement and
pur&s;e of Princes, and the united endeavours of great
&s;ocieties in the&s;e later ages, have extended experi|mental
and mechanical knowledge very far, yet it
mu&s;t be owned, that the ancients too were not
ignorant of many things<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">166, 167, 168, 241, 242, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, as well in phy&s;ics as
metaphy&s;ics, which perhaps are more generally,
though not fir&s;t known in the&s;e modern times.</P>
<P>266. The Pythagoreans and Platoni&s;ts had a no|tion
of the true &s;y&s;tem of the world. They allowed
of mechanical principles, but actuated by &s;oul or
mind: they di&s;tingui&s;hed the primary qualities in
bodies from the &s;econdary, making the former to
be phy&s;ical cau&s;es, and they under&s;tood phy&s;ical
cau&s;es in a right &s;en&s;e: they &s;aw that a mind infi|nite
in power, unextended, invi&s;ible, immortal,
governed, connected and contained all things: they
&s;aw there was no &s;uch thing as real ab&s;olute &s;pace:
that mind, &s;oul or &s;pirit, truly and really exi&s;ts:
that bodies exi&s;t only in a &s;econdary and dependent
&s;en&s;e: that the &s;oul is the place of forms: that the
&s;en&s;ible qualities are to be regarded as acts only
in the cau&s;e, and as pa&s;&s;ions in us: they ac|curately
con&s;idered the differences of intellect, ra|tional
&s;oul, and &s;en&s;itive &s;oul, with their di&s;tinct
acts of intellection, rea&s;oning, and &s;en&s;ation, points
wherein the Carte&s;ians and their followers, who
con&s;ider &s;en&s;ation as a mode of thinking, &s;eem to
have failed. They knew there was a &s;ubtil aether
pervading the whole ma&s;s of corporeal beings,
and which was it&s;elf actually moved and directed
<PB N="128" REF="127">
by a mind: and that phy&s;ical cau&s;es were only
in&s;truments, or rather marks and &s;igns.</P>
<P>267. Tho&s;e ancient philo&s;ophers under&s;tood the
generation of animals to con&s;i&s;t, in the unfolding
and di&s;tending of the minute imperceptible parts of
pre-existing animalcules, which pa&s;&s;eth for a modern
di&s;covery: this they took for the work of nature, but
nature animate and intelligent<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">172.</NOTE>: they under&s;tood
that all things were alive and in motion: they &s;up|po&s;ed
a concord and di&s;cord, union and di&s;union
in particles, &s;ome attracting, others repelling each
other: and that tho&s;e attractions and repul&s;ions, &s;o
various, regular, and u&s;eful, could not be account|ed
for, but by an intelligence pre&s;iding and direct|ing
all particular motions, for the con&s;ervation and
benefit of the whole.</P>
<P>268. The Aegyptians, who imper&s;onated nature,
had made her a di&s;tinct principle, and even deified
her under the name of I&s;is. But O&s;iris was under|&s;tood
to be mind or rea&s;on, chief and &s;overeign of
all. O&s;iris, if we may believe Plutarch, was the
fir&s;t, pure, unmixed and holy principle, not di&s;cer|nible
by the lower faculties; a glymp&s;e whereof
like lightening darting forth, irradiates the under|&s;tanding;
with regard to which Plutarch adds, that
Plato and Ari&s;totle termed one part of philo&s;ophy
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: to wit, when having &s;oared above com|mon
mixed objects, and got beyond the precincts
of &s;en&s;e and opinion, they arrive to contemplate
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple being, free from all mat|ter
and compo&s;ition. This is that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
of Plato, which employeth mind alone; which
alone governs the &s;oul. And the &s;oul is that which
immediately informs and animates nature.</P>

269. Although the Aegyptians did &s;ymbolically
repre&s;ent the &s;upreme divinity &s;itting on a lotus,
and that ge&s;ture hath been interpreted to &s;ignify,
the mo&s;t holy and venerable being to be utterly
at re&s;t repo&s;ing within him&s;elf; yet, for any thing
that appears, this ge&s;ture might denote dignity as
well as repo&s;e. And it cannot be denied, that
Jamblicus, &s;o knowing in the Aegyptian notions,
taught there was an intellect that proceeded to ge|neration,
drawing forth the latent powers into
light in the formation of things. Nor was this to
be under&s;tood of an external world, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in
real ab&s;olute &s;pace; For it was a doctrine of tho&s;e
antient Sages, that Soul was the place of forms,
as may be &s;een in the twelfth book of the arcane
part of divine wi&s;dom, according to the Aegyptians.
This notion was embraced by divers philo&s;ophers
of Greece, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived
it from the &s;ame &s;ource, from whence many of
their other opinions were drawn.</P>
<P>270. The doctrine of real ab&s;olute external
&s;pace, induced &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers to con|clude
it was a part or attribute of God, or that
God him&s;elf was &s;pace; ina&s;much as incommuni|cable
attributes of the deity appeared to agree
thereto, &s;uch as infinity, immutability, indivi&s;i|bility,
incorporeity, being uncreated, impa&s;&s;ive,
without beginning or ending; not con&s;idering that
all the&s;e negative properties may belong to no|thing.
For nothing hath no limits, cannot be
moved or changed, or divided, is neither created
nor de&s;troyed. A different way of thinking ap|pears
in the Hermaic as well as other writings of
the ancients. With regard to ab&s;olute &s;pace, it is
ob&s;erved in the A&s;clepian dialogue; that the
word Space or Place hath by it &s;elf no meaning;
and again, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand what
<PB N="130" REF="129">
Space alone or pure Space is. And Plotinus ac|knowledgeth
no place but &s;oul or mind, expre&s;ly
affirming that the &s;oul is not in the world, but the
world in the &s;oul. And farther, the place of the
&s;oul, &s;aith he, is not body, but &s;oul is in mind,
and body in &s;oul. See the third chapter of the
fifth book of the fifth Ennead.</P>
<P>271. Concerning ab&s;olute &s;pace that phantome
of the mechanic and Geometrical Philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">250.</NOTE>,
it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that it is neither per|ceived
by any &s;en&s;e, nor proved by any rea&s;on,
and was accordingly treated by the greate&s;t of the
ancients as a thing merely vi&s;ionary. From the no|tion
of ab&s;olute &s;pace &s;prings that of ab&s;olute mo|tion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Our judgment in the&s;e matters is not to be over|born by a pre&s;umed evidence of mathematical notions and rea&s;onings, &s;ince it is plain, the mathematicians of this age embrace ob&s;cure notions, and uncertain opinions, and are puzzled about them, contradicting each other and di&s;|puting like other Men: witne&s;s their doctrine of Fluxions, about which, within the&s;e ten years, I have &s;een publi&s;hed about twenty tracts and di&s;&s;ertations, who&s;e authors being utterly at variance, and incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, in|&s;truct by-&s;tanders what to think of their preten&s;ions to evidence.</NOTE>;
and in the&s;e are ultimately founded the no|tions
of external exi&s;tence, independence, nece&s;|&s;ity,
and $ate. Which fate, the idol of many mo|derns,
was by old philo&s;ophers differently under|&s;tood,
and in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as not to de&s;troy the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of God or man. Parmenides, who
thought all things to be made by nece&s;&s;ity or fate,
under&s;tood ju&s;tice and providence to be the &s;ame
with fate; which, how fixed and cogent &s;oever
with re&s;pect to man, may yet be voluntary with
re&s;pect to God. Empedocles declared Fate to be
<PB N="131" REF="130">
a cau&s;e u&s;ing principles and elements. Heraclitus
taught that Fate was the general rea&s;on that runs
through the whole nature of the univer&s;e: which
nature he &s;uppo&s;ed to be an aethereal body, the
&s;eed of the generation of all things. Plato held
Fate to be the eternal rea&s;on or law of nature.
Chry&s;ippus &s;uppo&s;ed that Fate was a &s;piritual pow|er
which di&s;po&s;ed the world in order; that it was
the rea&s;on and law of tho&s;e things which are ad|mini&s;tred
by providence.</P>
<P>272. All the forgoing notions of Fate, as re|pre&s;ented
by Plutarch, do plainly &s;hew that tho&s;e
antient philo&s;ophers did not mean by Fate a blind,
head-long, unintelligent principle, but an orderly
&s;ettled cour&s;e of things conducted by a wi&s;e and
provident mind. And as for the Aegygtian doc|trine,
it is indeed a&s;&s;erted in the Pimander, that
all Things are produced by Fate. But Jamblichus,
who drew his notions from Aegypt, affirms that
the whole of things is not bound up in Fate; but
that there is a principle of the &s;oul higher than
nature, whereby we may be rai&s;ed to an union
with the Gods and exempt our&s;elves from Fate.
And in the A&s;clepian dialogue it is expre&s;ly &s;aid
that fate follows the decrees of God. And indeed
as all the motions in nature are evidently the pro|duct
of rea&s;on<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154.</NOTE>, it should &s;eem there is no room
for nece&s;&s;ity, in any other &s;en&s;e than that of a
&s;teady regular cour&s;e.</P>
<P>273. Blind fate and blind chance are at bottom
much the &s;ame thing, and one no more intelligible
than the other. Such is the mutual relation, con|nection,
motion, and &s;ympathy of the parts of
this world, that they &s;eem as it were animated and
held together by one &s;oul: and &s;uch is their har|mony,
<PB N="132" REF="131">
order, and regular cour&s;e, as &s;heweth the
&s;oul to be governed and directed by a mind. It
was an opinion of remote antiquity that the world
was an animol<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">153, 172.</NOTE>. If we may tru&s;t the Hermaic
writings, the Aegyptians thought all things did par|take
of Life. This opinion was al&s;o &s;o general and
current among the Greeks, that Plutarch a&s;&s;erts all
others held the world to be an animal, and govern|ed
by providence, except Leucippus, Democritus,
and Epicurus. And although an animal, contain|ing
all bodies within it &s;elf, could not be touched
or &s;en&s;ibly affected from without; yet it is plain
they attributed to it an inward &s;en&s;e and feeling,
as well as appetites and aver&s;ions; and that from
all the various tones, actions, and pa&s;&s;ions of the
univer&s;e, they &s;uppo&s;ed one &s;ymphony, one animal
act and life to re&s;ult.</P>
<P>274. Jamblichus declares the world to be one
animal, in which the parts however di&s;tant each
from other, are neverthele&s;s related and connected
by one common nature. And he teacheth, what is
also a received notion of the Pythagoreans and
Platonics that there is no cha&s;m in nature, but a
chain or &s;cale of beings ri&s;ing by gentle uninter|rupted
gradations from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t,
each nature being informed and perfected by the
participation of a higher. As air becomes igneous,
&s;o the pure&s;t fire becomes animal, and the animal
&s;oul becomes intellectual, which is to be under&s;tood
not of the change of one nature into another, but
of the connection of different natures, each lower
nature being, according to tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, as it
were a receptacle or &s;ubject for the next above it
to re&s;ide and act in.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="132">
275. It is al&s;o the doctrine of Platonic philo|&s;ophers,
that intellect is the very life of living
things, the fir&s;t principle and exemplar of all, from
whence by different degrees are derived the in|ferior
cla&s;&s;es of life; fir&s;t the rational, then the
&s;en&s;itive, after that the vegetal, but &s;o as in the
rational animal there is &s;till &s;omewhat intellectual,
again in the &s;en&s;itive there is &s;omewhat rational,
and in the vegetal &s;omewhat &s;en&s;itive, and la&s;tly
in mixt bodies, as metals and minerals, &s;omewhat
of vegetation. By which means the whole is
thought to be more perfectly connected. Which
doctrine implies that all the faculties, in&s;tincts, and
motions of inferior beings, in their &s;everal re&s;pec|tive
&s;ubordinations, are derived from, and depend
upon mind and intellect.</P>
<P>276. Both Stoics and Platonics held the world
to be alive, though &s;ometimes it be mentioned as a
&s;entient animal, &s;ometimes as a plant or vegetable.
But in this, notwith&s;tanding what hath been &s;ur|mi&s;ed
by &s;ome learned men, there &s;eems to be no
Athei&s;m. For &s;o long as the world is &s;uppo&s;ed to
be quickened by elementary fire or &s;pirit, which is
it &s;elf animated by &s;oul, and directed by under|&s;tanding,
it follows that all parts thereof originally
depend upon, and may be reduced unto, the &s;ame
indivi&s;ible &s;tem or principle, to wit, a &s;upreme
mind; which is the concurrent doctrine of Pytha|goraeans,
Platonics, and Stoics.</P>
<P>277. There is according to tho&s;e philo&s;ophers a
life infu&s;ed throughout all things: the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
an intellectual and artificial fire<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">166, 168, 174, 175, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, an
inward principle, animal &s;pirit, or natural life
producing and forming within as art doth without,
regulating, moderating and reconciling the various
motions qualities and parts of this mundane &s;y&s;tem.
<PB N="134" REF="133">
By virtue of this life the great ma&s;&s;es are held
together in their orderly cour&s;es, as well as the
minute&s;t particles governed in their natural motions,
according to the &s;everal laws of attraction, gravity,
electricity, magneti&s;m, and the re&s;t. It is this
gives in&s;tincts, teaches the &s;pider her web, and the
bee her honey. This it is that directs the roots of
plants to draw forth juices from the earth, and the
leaves and cortical ve&s;&s;els to &s;eparate and attract
&s;uch particles of air, and elementary fire, as &s;uit
their re&s;pective natures.</P>
<P>278. Nature &s;eems to be not otherwi&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from the anima mundi, than as life is from
&s;oul, and upon the principles of the olde&s;t phi|lo&s;ophers,
may not improperly or incongruou&s;ly be
&s;tyled the Life of the world. Some Platonics in|deed,
regard life as the act of nature, in like man|ner
as intellection is of the mind or intellect. As
the fir&s;t intellect acts by under&s;tanding, &s;o natu$e
according to them acts or generates by living. But
life is the act of the &s;oul, and &s;eems to be very
nature it &s;elf, which is not the principle, but the
re&s;ult of another and higher principle, being a life
re&s;ulting from &s;oul, as cogitation from intellect.</P>
<P>279 If nature be the life of the world, anima|mated
by one &s;oul, compacted into one frame,
and directed or governed in all parts by one mind;
This &s;y&s;tem cannot be accu&s;ed of Athei&s;m; though
perhaps it may of mi&s;take or impropriety. And
yet, as one pre&s;iding mind gives unity to the infi|nite
aggregate of things, by a mutual communion
of actions and pa&s;&s;ions, and an adju&s;tment of
parts, cau&s;ing all to concur in one view to one and
the &s;ame end, the ultimate and &s;upreme good of
the whole, it &s;hould &s;eem rea&s;onable to &s;ay, with
Ocellus Lucanus the Pythagoraean, that as life
holds together the bodies of animals, the cau&s;e
<PB N="135" REF="134">
whereof is the &s;oul; and as a city is held together
by concord, the cau&s;e whereof is law; even &s;o
the world is held together by harmony, the cau&s;e
whereof is God. And in this &s;en&s;e, the world or
univer&s;e may be con&s;idered either as one animal<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">172, 277.</NOTE>
or one city.</P>
<P>280. Ari&s;totle di&s;approves the opinion of tho&s;e
who hold a &s;oul to be diffu&s;ed throughout the
world; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e the elements
are not alive. Though perhaps it may not be ea&s;y to
prove, that blood and animal &s;pirit are more alive in
man, than water and fire in the world. That Phi|lo&s;opher,
in his books of the Soul, remarks upon
an opinion &s;et forth in the Orphics, of the Soul's
entering from the univer&s;e into living creatures be|ing
born by winds, that this cannot be true of plants or of
certain animals which do not breath.
But air ve&s;&s;els are by later experiments allowed to
be found in all plants and animals. And air may
in &s;ome &s;ort not improperly be &s;aid, to be the car|rier
or vehicle of the &s;oul, ina&s;much as it is the ve|hicle
of fire, which is the &s;pirit immediately moved
and animated by the &s;oul<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">163, 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>281. The living fire, the living omniform &s;emi|nary
of the world, and other expre&s;&s;ions of the
like nature occuring in the ancient and Platonic
Philo&s;ophy, how can they be under&s;tood exclu|&s;ive
of light or elemental fire, the particles of
which are known to be heterogeneous, and, for
ought we know, may &s;ome of them be organized,
and, notwith&s;tanding their wonderful minutene&s;s,
contain original &s;eeds which, being formed and
&s;own in a proper matrix, do gradually unfold and
manife&s;t them&s;elves, &s;till growing to a ju&s;t propor|tion
of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="135">
282. May not this aethereal &s;eminary, con|&s;i&s;tently
with the notions of that philo&s;ophy, which
a&s;cribed much of generation to cele&s;tial influence,
be &s;uppo&s;ed to impregnate plants and animals with
the fir&s;t principles, the &s;tamina, or tho&s;e animal-cules
which Plato, in his Timaeus, &s;aith are invi|&s;ible
for their &s;mallne&s;s, but, being &s;own in a pro|per
matrix, are therein gradually di&s;tended and ex|plicated
by nouri&s;hment, and at length the animals
brought forth to light. Which notion hath been
revived and received of late years by many, who
perhaps are not aware of it's antiquity, or that it
was to be found in Plato. Timaeus Locren&s;is in
his book of the &s;oul of the world, &s;uppo&s;eth even
&s;ouls to be derived from the caele&s;tial luminaries,
excepting only the rational or intellectual part.
But what influence or influx is there from the
caele&s;tial bodies, which hath not light for it's ve|hicle<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">43.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>283. What other nature there &s;hould be in|termediate
between the &s;oul of the world<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">171.</NOTE> and
this gro&s;s corporeal &s;y&s;tem, which might be the
vehicle of life, or, to u&s;e the language of philo&s;o|phers,
might receive or be impre&s;&s;ed with the
forms of things, is difficult to comprehend. It is
a vulgar remark, that the works of art do not
bear a nice micro&s;copical in&s;pection, but the more
helps are u&s;ed, and the more nicely you pry into
natural productions, the more do you di&s;cover
of the fine mechani&s;m of nature, which is endle&s;s
or inexhau&s;tible; new and other parts, more &s;ub|tile
and delicate than the precedent, &s;till continu|ing
to offer them&s;elves to view. And the&s;e mi|cro&s;copical
ob&s;ervations have confirmed the ancient
theory concerning generation, delivered in the
Timaeus of Plato. But that theory or hypothe&s;is,
<PB N="137" REF="136">
how agreeable &s;oever to modern di&s;coveries, is not
alone &s;ufficient to explain the phaenomena, without
the immediate action of a mind. And Ficinus,
notwith&s;tanding what him&s;elf and other Platonics
&s;ay of a pla&s;tic nature, is obliged to own, that
with the mundane force or &s;oul it is to be under|&s;tood,
there is joined an intelligence, upon which
the &s;eminal nature con&s;tantly depends, and by
which it is governed.</P>
<P>284. Alcinous in his tract of the doctrine of
Plato &s;aith that God hath given the world both
mind and &s;oul: others include both in the word
&s;oul, and &s;uppo&s;e the &s;oul of the world to be God.
Philo appears to be of this opinion in &s;everal parts
of his writings. And Virgil, who was no &s;tranger
to the Pythagoraean and Platonic tenets writes to
the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>Deum namque ire per omnes</L>
<L>Terras que tractu&s;que maris coelumque
pro|fundum.</L>
<L>Hinc pecudes armenta, viros, genus omne fe|rarum</L></Q>
<P>Quemque &s;ibi tenues na&s;centem arce&s;&s;ere vitas.
Thus much the &s;chools of Plato and Pythagoras
&s;eem agreed in, to wit, that the &s;oul of the world
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">153, 172.</NOTE>, whether having a di&s;tinct mind of its own,
or directed by a &s;uperior mind<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">154, 279.</NOTE>, doth embrace
all it's parts, connect them by an invi&s;ible and in|di&s;&s;oluble
chain, and pre&s;erve them ever well ad|ju&s;ted
and in good order.</P>
<P>285. Naturali&s;ts, who&s;e proper province it is
to con&s;ider phaenomena, experiments, mechanical
organs and motions, do principally regard the
vi&s;ible frame of things or corporeal world, &s;uppo|&s;ing
&s;oul to be contained in body. And this
hypothe&s;is may be tolerated in phy&s;ics, as it is not
<PB N="138" REF="137">
nece&s;&s;ary in the arts of dyalling or navigation to
mention the true &s;y&s;tem or earth's motion. But
tho&s;e who, not content with &s;en&s;ible appearances,
would penetrate into the real and true cau&s;es (the
object of theology, metaphy&s;ics, or the philo&s;o|phia
prima) will rectify this errour, and &s;peak
of the world as contained by the &s;oul, and not the
&s;oul by the world.</P>
<P>286. Ari&s;totle hath ob&s;erved there were in|deed
&s;ome who thought &s;o gro&s;ly, as to &s;uppo&s;e
the univer&s;e to be one only corporeal and extend|ed
nature: but in the fir&s;t Book of his metaphy|&s;ics
he ju&s;tly remarks they were guilty of a great
mi&s;take; fora&s;much as they took into their ac|count
the elements of corporeal beings alone;
whereas there are incorporeal beings al&s;o in the
univer&s;e; and while they attempted to a&s;&s;ign the
cau&s;es of generation and corruption, and account
for the nature of all things, they did at the &s;ame
time de&s;troy the very cau&s;e of motion.</P>
<P>287. It is a doctrine among other &s;peculations
contained in the Hermatic writings, that all things
are one. And it is not improbable that Orp$eus,
Parmenides, and others among the Greeks, might
have derived their notion of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> from Aegypt.
Though that &s;ubtil metaphy&s;ician Parmenides, in
his doctrine of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;eems to have added &s;ome|thing
of his own. If we &s;uppo&s;e, that one and the
&s;ame mind is the univer&s;al principle of order and
harmony throughout the world, containing and
connecting all it's parts, and giving unity to the
&s;ystem, there &s;eems to be nothing athei&s;tical or
impious in this &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>288. Number is no object of &s;en&s;e: it is an
act of the mind. The &s;ame thing in a different
conception is one or many. Comprehending God
and the creatures in one general notion, we may
<PB N="139" REF="138">
&s;ay that all things together make one univer&s;e, or
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> But if we &s;hould &s;ay, that all things make
one God; this would, indeed, be an erroneous no|tion
of God, but would not amount to Athei&s;m,
&s;o long as mind or interlect was admitted to be
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the governing part. It is ne|verthele&s;s
more re&s;pectful, and con&s;equently the
truer notion of God, to &s;uppo&s;e him neither made
up of parts, nor to be him&s;elf a part of any
whole what&s;oever.</P>
<P>289. All tho&s;e, who conceived the univer&s;e to
be an animal, mu&s;t in con&s;equence of that notion,
&s;uppo&s;e all things to be one. But to conceive God
to be the &s;entient Soul of an animal, is altoge|ther
unworthy and ab&s;urd. There is no &s;en&s;e,
nor &s;en&s;ory, nor any thing like a &s;en&s;e or &s;en&s;o|ry
in God. Sen&s;e implies an impre&s;&s;ion from
&s;ome other being, and denotes a dependence in the
Soul which hath it. Sen&s;e is a pa&s;&s;ion: and pa&s;&s;ions
imply imperfection. God knoweth all things, as
pure mind or intellect, but nothing by &s;en&s;e, nor
in nor through a &s;en&s;ory. Therefore to &s;uppo&s;e
a &s;en&s;ory of any kind, whether &s;pace or any
other, in God would be very wrong, and lead us
into fal&s;e conceptions of this nature. The pre&s;um|ing
there was &s;uch a thing as real ab&s;olute uncrea|ted
&s;pace, &s;eems to have occa&s;ioned that mo|dern
mi&s;take. But this pre&s;umption was without
grounds.</P>
<P>290. Body is oppo&s;ite to &s;pirit or mind. We
have a notion of &s;pirit from thought and action.
We have a notion of body from re&s;i&s;tance. So
far forth as there is real power, there is &s;pirit.
So far forth as there is re&s;i&s;tance, there is inability
or want of power. That is, there is a negation of
&s;pirit. We are embodied, that is, we are clogged
by weight, and hindered by re&s;i&s;tance. But in
<PB N="140" REF="139">
re&s;pect of a perfect &s;pirit, there is nothing hard
or impenetrable: there is no re&s;i&s;tance to the de|ity:
Nor hath he any body: Nor is the &s;upreme
being united to the world, as the &s;oul of an animal
is to it's body, which nece&s;&s;arily implieth defect,
both as an in&s;trument and as a con&s;tant weight
and impediment.</P>
<P>291. Thus much it con&s;i&s;ts with piety to &s;ay,
that a divine agent doth by his virtue permeate
and govern the elementary fire or light,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">157, 172.</NOTE>
which &s;erves as an animal &s;pirit to enliven and
actuate the whole ma&s;s, and all the members of
this vi&s;ible world. Nor is this doctrine le&s;s philo|&s;ophical
than pious. We &s;ee all nature alive or in
motion. We &s;ee water turned into air, and air ra|refied
and made ela&s;tic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">149, 152, 200.</NOTE> by the attraction of
another medium, more pure indeed, more &s;ubtil
and more volatile than air. But &s;till, as this is a
moveable extended and, con&s;equently, a corpo|real
being,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">207.</NOTE> it cannot be it &s;elf the principle
of motion, but leads us naturally and nece&s;&s;arily
to an incorporeal &s;pirit or agent. We are con|&s;cious
that a &s;pirit can begin, alter, or determine
motion, but nothing of this appears in body. Nay
the contrary is evident, both to experiment and
reflection.</P>
<P>292. Natural phaenomena are only natural ap|pearances.
They are, therefore, &s;uch as we &s;ee
and perceive them. Their real and objective na|tures
are, therefore, the &s;ame; pa&s;&s;ive without any
thing active, fluent and changing without any
thing permanent in them. However, as the&s;e
make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and the mind takes her
fir&s;t flight and &s;pring, as it were, by re&s;ting her
foot on the&s;e objects, they are not only fir&s;t con&s;i|dered
by all men, but mo&s;t con&s;idered by mo&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="140">

<P>303. The perceptions of &s;en&s;e are gro&s;s: but

harmony and proportion are not objects of &s;en&s;e,

the mind &s;uch materials, by means whereof &s;he

And the uppermo&s;t naturally leads to the Deity,

naturally ab&s;tru&s;e and involved in darkne&s;s: but
becau&s;e their nature and exi&s;tence is uncertain, ever
fleeting and changing. Or rather, becau&s;e they do
not in &s;trict truth exi&s;t at all, being always gene|rating
or in fieri, that is, in a perpetual flux, with|out
any thing &s;table or permanent in them to con|&s;titute
an object of real &s;cience. The Pythagore|ans
and Platonics di&s;tingui&s;h between <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> that which is ever generated and that
which exi&s;ts. Sen&s;ible things and corporeal forms
are perpetually producing and peri&s;hing, appearing

always in motion and change; and therefore in

while <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is under&s;tood to be &s;omewhat of an
ab&s;tract or &s;piritual nature, and the proper object

be no knowledge of things flowing and in&s;table, the
opinion of Protagoras and Theaetetus, that &s;en&s;e
was &s;cience, is ab&s;urd. And indeed nothing is
more evident, than that the apparent &s;izes and

<P>306. In the ancient philo&s;ophy of Plato and
Pythagoras, we find di&s;tingui&s;hed three &s;orts of
objects: In the fir&s;t place a form or &s;pecies that is
neither generated nor de&s;troyed, unchangeable, in|vi&s;ible,
and altogether imperceptible to &s;en&s;e, be|ing
only under&s;tood by the intellect. A &s;econd
&s;ort there is ever fluent and changing<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">292, 293.</NOTE>, genera|ting
and peri&s;hing, appearing and vani&s;hing. This
is comprehended by &s;en&s;e and opinion. The third
kind is matter which, as Plato teacheth, being
neither an object of under&s;tanding nor of &s;en&s;e,
is hardly to be made out by a certain &s;purious way
of rea&s;oning <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. See his
Timaeus The &s;ame doctrine is contained in the
Pythagoric treati&s;e de anima mundi, which di&s;|tingui&s;hing
ideas, &s;en&s;ible things, and matter, ma|keth
the fir&s;t to be apprehended by intellect, the
&s;econd by &s;en&s;e, and the la&s;t, to wit, matter,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> whereof Themi&s;tius the Peripatetic
a&s;signs the rea&s;on. For, &s;aith he, that act is to be
e&s;teemed &s;purious, who&s;e object hath nothing po&s;i|tive,
being only a mere privation, as &s;ilence or
darkne&s;s. And &s;uch he accounteth matter.</P>
<P>307. Ari&s;totle maketh a threefold di&s;tinction of
objects according to the three &s;peculative &s;ciences.
Phy&s;ics he &s;uppo&s;eth to be conver&s;ant about &s;uch
<PB N="149" REF="150">
things as have a principle of motion in them&s;elves,
mathematics about things permanent but not ab|&s;tracted,
and theology about being ab&s;tracted and
immoveable, which di&s;tinction may be &s;een in the
ninth book of his metaphy&s;ics. Where by ab|&s;tracted,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, he under&s;tands &s;eperable from
corporeal beings and &s;en&s;ible qualities.</P>
<P>308. That philo&s;opher held that the mind of
man was a tabula ra&s;a, and that there were no
innate ideas. Plato, on the contray, held original
ideas in the mind, that is, notions which never
were or can be in the &s;en&s;e, &s;uch as being, beauty,
goodne&s;s, likene&s;s, parity. Some perhaps may
think the truth to be this: that there are proper|ly
no ideas or pa&s;&s;ive objects in the mind, but
what what were derived from &s;en&s;e: but that there
are al&s;o be&s;ides the&s;e her own acts or operations:
&s;uch are notions.</P>
<P>309. It is a maxim of the Platonic philo&s;ophy,
that the &s;oul of Man was originally furni&s;hed with
native inbred notions, and &s;tands in need of &s;en|&s;ible
occa&s;ions, not ab&s;olutely for producing them,
but only for awakening, rou&s;ing or exciting, into
act what was already preexi&s;tent, dormant, and
latent in the &s;oul; as things are &s;aid to be laid up
in the memory, though not actually perceived,
untill they happen to be called forth and brought
into view by other objects. This notion &s;eemeth
&s;omewhat different from that of innate ideas, as
under&s;tood by tho&s;e moderns who have atempted
to explode them. To under&s;tand and to be, are
according to Parmenides the &s;ame thing. And
Plato in his &s;eventh letter makes no difference be|tween
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, mind and knowledge.

that it is not to be under&s;tood of the whole &s;oul

third book de anima. Whence, according to The|mi&s;tius
in his commentary on that treati&s;e, it may

&s;aith he, the forms are the beings. By the Form
every thing is what it is. And he adds, it is the
&s;oul that imparteth forms to matter; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Therefore they are fir&s;t
in the &s;oul. He further adds, that the mind is all
things, taking the forms of all things it becomes
all things by intellect and &s;en&s;e. Alexander
Aphrodi&s;aeus &s;aith as much, affirming the mind to
be all things <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. And
this in fact is Ari&s;totle's own doctrine in his third

that actual knowledge and the thing known are all

Whence it follows that the things are
where the knowledge is, that is to &s;ay in the mind.

In the Theaetetus we are told, that if any one
&s;aith a thing is or is made, he mu&s;t withal &s;ay,
for what, or of what, or in re&s;pect of what, it is
or is made; for, that any thing &s;hould exi&s;t in it

it is impo&s;&s;ible a thing &s;hould be &s;weet,
and &s;weet to no body. It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be owned with

they never appear to us the &s;ame, no more than

never remain the &s;ame our &s;elves? and again, he
&s;aith, &s;en&s;ible things, although they receive no

to Ari&s;totle, becau&s;e a thing is, it mu&s;t
actually exi&s;t. This is evident from the eighth
book of his metaphy&s;ics, where he animadverts
on the Megaric philo&s;ophers, as not admitting a
po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence di&s;tinct from the actual: from
whence, &s;aith he, it mu&s;t follow, that there is no|thing
cold or hot or &s;weet or any &s;en&s;ible thing

illu&s;trate the manner in which Socrates, Plato, and
their followers conceived innate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">309.</NOTE> notions to be
in the &s;oul of man. It was the Platonic doctrine,
that humane &s;ouls or minds de&s;cended from above,
and were &s;owed in generation, that they were &s;tun|ned,
&s;tupified, and intoxicated by this de&s;cent and
immer&s;ion into animal nature. And that the &s;oul,
in this <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or &s;lumber, forgets her original
notions, which are &s;mothered and oppre&s;&s;ed by
many fal&s;e tenets and prejudices of &s;en&s;e. In&s;o|much
that Proclus compares the &s;oul, in her de&s;|cent
inve&s;ted with growing prejudices, to Glaucus
diving to the bottom of the &s;ea, and there con|tracting
divers coats of &s;ea weed, coral, and &s;hells,
which &s;tick clo&s;e to him and conceal his true
&s;hape.</P>
<P>314. Hence, according to this philo&s;ophy, the
mind of man is &s;o re&s;tle&s;s to &s;hake off that &s;lum|ber,
to di&s;engage and emancipate her&s;elf from
tho&s;e prejudices and fal&s;e opinions, that &s;o &s;traitly
be&s;et and cling to her, to rub off tho&s;e covers, that
di&s;guise her original form, and to regain her primae|val
&s;tate and fir&s;t notions: Hence, that perpetu|al
&s;truggle to recover the lo&s;t region of light, that
ardent thir&s;t and endeavour after truth and intel|lectual
ideas, which &s;he would neither &s;eek to at|tain,
nor rejoice in, nor know when attained, ex|cept
&s;he had &s;ome praenotion or anticipation of
them, and they had lain innate and dormant like
habits and &s;ciences in the mind, or things laid up,
which are called out and rou&s;ed by recollection or
remini&s;cence. So that learning &s;eemeth in effect
remini&s;cence.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">
315. The Peripateticks them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;h
between remini&s;cence and mere memory. The|mi&s;tius
ob&s;erves that commonly the be&s;t memories
go with the wor&s;t parts; but that remini&s;cence is
mo&s;t perfect in the mo&s;t ingenious minds. And
notwith&s;tanding the tabula ra&s;a<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">308.</NOTE> of Ari&s;totle,
yet &s;ome of his followers have undertaken to make
him &s;peak Plato's &s;en&s;e. Thus Plutarch the Peri|patetic
teacheth as agreeable to his ma&s;ter's doc|trine,
that learning is remini&s;cence, and that the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is in children. Simplicius al&s;o, in
his Commentary on the third book of Ari&s;totle
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;peaketh of a certain interiour rea&s;on
in the &s;oul, acting of it &s;elf, and originally full of
it's own proper notions, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>316. And, as the Platonic philo&s;ophy &s;uppo&s;ed
intellectual notions to be originally inexi&s;tent or
innate in the &s;oul<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">309, 314.</NOTE>, &s;o likewi&s;e it &s;uppo&s;ed &s;en|sible
qualities to exi&s;t (though not originally) in the
&s;oul, and there only. Socrates &s;aith to Theaetetus,
you mu&s;t not think the white colour that you &s;ee
is in any thing without your eyes, or in your eyes,
or in any place at all. And in the Timaeus Plato
teacheth, that the figure and motion of the particles of
fire dividing the parts of our bodies produce that
painful &s;en&s;ation we call heat. And Plotinus, in the
&s;ixth book of his &s;econd Aenead, ob&s;erves that
heat and other qualities are not qualities in the
things them&s;elves, but acts: that heat is not a
quality but act in the fire: that Fire is not really
what we perceive in the qualities light, heat, and
colour. From all which it is plain, that whatever
real things they &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t independent of
<PB N="154" REF="155">
the &s;oul, tho&s;e were neither &s;en&s;ible things, no$
cloathed with &s;en&s;ible qualities.</P>
<P>317. Neither Plato nor Ari&s;totle by matter,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, under&s;tood corporeal &s;ub&s;tance, whatever
the moderns may under&s;tand by that word. To
them certainly it &s;ignified no po&s;itive actual being.
Ari&s;totle de&s;cribes it as made up of negatives, ha|ving
neither quantity nor quality nor e&s;&s;ence. And
not only the Platoni&s;ts and Pythagoreans, but al&s;o
the Peripateticks them&s;elves declare it to be known,
neither by &s;en&s;e, nor by any direct and ju&s;t rea|&s;oning,
but only by &s;ome &s;purious or adulterine
method, as hath been ob&s;erved before. Simon
Portius, a famous Peripatetic of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
denies it to be any &s;ub&s;tance at all, for, &s;aith
he, nequit per &s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tere quia &s;equeretur, id
quod non e&s;t in actu e&s;&s;e in actu. If Jamblichus
may be credited, the Aegyptians &s;uppo&s;ed matter
&s;o far from including ought of &s;ub&s;tance or e&s;&s;ence,
that, according to them, God produced it by a
&s;eparation from all &s;ub&s;tance, e&s;&s;ence or being,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. That matter is
actually nothing, but potentially all things, is the
doctrine of Ari&s;totle, Theophra&s;tus, and all the
antient Peripatetics.</P>
<P>318. According to tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, matter is
only a pura potentia, a mere po&s;&s;ibility. But Anax|imander,
&s;ucce&s;&s;or to Thales, is repre&s;ented as
having thought the &s;upreme deity to be infinite
matter. Neverthele&s;s though Plutarch calleth it
matter, yet it was &s;imply <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which means
no more than infinite or indefinite. And although
the moderns teach that &s;pace is real and infinitely
extended: yet if we con&s;ider that it is no intellec|tual
<PB N="155" REF="156">
notion, nor yet perceived by any of our &s;en|&s;es,
we &s;hall perhaps be inclined to think with
Plato in his Timaeus, that this al&s;o is the re&s;ult of
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or &s;purious rea&s;oning, and a kind of
waking dream. Plato ob&s;erves that we dream,
as it were, when we think of place, and believe
it nece&s;&s;ary, that whatever exi&s;ts &s;hould exi&s;t in
&s;ome place. Which place or &s;pace<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">250, 270.</NOTE> he al&s;o
ob&s;erves is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, that is to be felt
as darkne&s;s is &s;een, or &s;ilence heard, being a mere
privation.</P>
<P>319. If any one &s;hould think to infer the reality
or actual being of matter from the modern tenet,
that gravity is always proportionable to the
quantity of matter, let him but narrowly &s;can the
modern demon&s;tration of that tenet, and he will
find it to be a vain circle, concluding in truth no
more than this, that gravity is proportionable to
weight, that is to it &s;elf. Since matter is conceived
only as defect and mere po&s;&s;ibility; and &s;ince God
is ab&s;olute perfection and act; it follows there is
the greate&s;t di&s;tance and oppo&s;ition imaginable
between God and Matter. In&s;omuch that a ma|terial
God would be altogether incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>320. The force that produces, the intellect
that orders, the goodne&s;s that perfects all things
is the &s;upreme being. Evil, defect, negation, is
not the object of God's creative power. From
motion the Peripatetics trace out a fir&s;t immo|veable
mover. The Platonics make God au|thor
of all good, author of no evil, and unchange|able.
According to Anaxagoras there was a con|fu&s;ed
ma&s;s of all things in one chaos, but mind
&s;upervening, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, di&s;tingui&s;hed and divided
<PB N="156" REF="157">
them. Anaxagoras, it &s;eems, a&s;cribed the motive
faculty to mind, which mind &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent phi|lo&s;ophers
have accurately di&s;criminated from &s;oul
and life, a&s;cribing to it the &s;ole faculty of intellec|tion.</P>
<P>321. But &s;till God was &s;uppo&s;ed the fir&s;t agent,
the &s;ource and original of all things, which he
produceth, not occa&s;ionally or in&s;trumentally
but with actual and real efficacy. Thus, the rea|ti&s;e,
De &s;ecretiore parte divinae &s;apientiae &s;ecundum
Aepyptios, in the tenth book, &s;aith of God, that
he is not only the fir&s;t agent, but al&s;o that he
it is who truly acts or creates, qui ver&egrave; efficit.</P>
<P>322. Varro, Tully, and St. Augu&s;tin under&s;tand
the &s;oul to be vis, the power, or force that acts,
moves, enlivens. Now although, in our con|ception,
vis, or &s;pirit might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from
mind, it would not thence follow, that it acts
blindly or without mind, or that it is not clo&s;ely
connected with intellect. If Plutarch is to be
tru&s;ted in his account of the opinions of Philo&s;o|phers:
Thales held the mind of the world to be
God: Democrius held the &s;oul of the world to be
an igniform deity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">166, 168, 277.</NOTE>: Pythagoras taught that
God was the monad and the good, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">:
Socrates al&s;o and Plato pronounced him to be
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">287.</NOTE>, the &s;ingle, &s;elf originate one,
e&s;&s;entially good. Each of which appellations and
forms of &s;peech directly tends to, and determines
in mind, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;aith Plutarch.</P>
<P>323. Whence that author concludes, that in the &s;en&s;e
of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers God is a mind, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
not an ab&s;tract idea compounded of incon&s;i&s;tencies
and pre&s;cinded from all real things, as &s;ome mo|derns
<PB N="157" REF="158">
under&s;tand ab&s;traction; but a really exi&s;ting
&s;pirit, di&s;tinct or &s;eparate from all &s;en&s;ible and cor|poreal
beings. And although the Stoicks are re|pre&s;ented
as holding a corporeal deity, or that the
very &s;y&s;tem of the world is God, yet it is certain
they did not, at bottom, di&s;&s;ent from the fore|mentioned
doctrine; ina&s;much as they &s;uppo&s;ed the
world to be an animal,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">276, 279.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;oul or
mind as well as body.</P>
<P>324. This notion was derived from the Pytha|goreans,
who held the world, as Timaeus Locrus
teacheth, to be one perfect animal, endued with
&s;oul and rea&s;on: but then they believed it to have
been generated: Whereas the Stoics looked on
the world as the &s;upreme God, including therein
mind or intellect. For the elementary fire, or, if
one may &s;o &s;peak, the animal &s;pirit of the world,
&s;eemeth, according to them, to have been
the vehicle of the &s;oul of the world<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">277, 284.</NOTE>,
and &s;oul it &s;elf the vehicle of intellect or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; &s;ince
they &s;tyled the Divinity <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">272.</NOTE>, or intel|lectual
fire.</P>
<P>325. The Aegyptians, if we may credit the Her|maic
writings, maintained God to be all things,
not only actual but po&s;&s;ible. He is &s;tyled by them,
that which is made and that which is unmade. And
therein it is &s;aid, &s;hall I prai&s;e thee for tho&s;e things
thou ha&s;t made manife&s;t, or for the things thou
ha&s;t hidden? therefore, in their &s;en&s;e, to manife&s;t,
was to create; the things created having been be|fore
hidden in God.

326. Now whether the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> be ab&s;tracted from
the &s;en&s;ible world, and con&s;idered by it &s;elf, as
di&s;tinct from, and pre&s;iding over the created &s;y&s;|tem,
or whether the whole univer&s;e, including

to be God<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">300.</NOTE>, and the creatures to be

<P>327. Nor if any one, with Ari&s;totle in his me|taphy&s;ics,
&s;hould deny that God knows any thing
without him&s;elf; &s;eeing that God comprehends all
things, could this be ju&s;tly pronounced an athei&s;tical

<P>328. Might we not conceive that God may be

that the divine force or influence premeates
<PB N="159" REF="162">
the intire univer&s;e<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">173.</NOTE> and that what the Pilot is
in a &s;hip, the driver in a chariot, the praecentor in
a choir, the law in a city, the general in an army,
the &s;ame God is in the world. This he amply &s;ets
forth in his book de mundo, a treati&s;e which ha|ving
been anciently a&s;cribed to him, ought not to
be &s;et a&s;ide from the difference of &s;tyle, which (as
Patricious rightly ob&s;erves) being in a letter to
a King, might well be &s;uppo&s;ed to differ from the
other dry and crabbed parts of his writings.</P>
<P>329. And although there are &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions to
be met with in the Philo&s;ophers, even of the Platonic
and Ari&s;totelic &s;ects, which &s;peak of God as mix|ing
with, or prevading all nature and all the ele|ments;
yet this mu&s;t be explained by force and
not by exten&s;ion, which was never attributed to
the mind<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">290, 293, 297, 319.</NOTE> either by Ari&s;totle or Plato. This
they always affirmed to be incorporeal: and, as
Plotinus remarks, incorporeal things are di&s;tant
each from other not by place, but (to u&s;e his ex|pre&s;&s;ion)
by alterity.</P>
<P>330. The&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions will probably &s;eem dry
and u&s;ele&s;s, to &s;uch readers as are accu&s;tomed to
con&s;ider only &s;en&s;ible objects. The employment
of the mind on things purely intellectual is to mo&s;t
men irk&s;ome: whereas the &s;en&s;ative powers, by
con&s;tant u&s;e acquire &s;trength. Hence, the objects
of &s;en&s;e more forcibly affect us<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">264, 294.</NOTE>, and are too
often counted the chief good. For the&s;e things men
fight, cheat and &s;cramble. Therefore, in order to
tame mankind and introduce a &s;en&s;e of virtue, the
be&s;t humane means is to exerci&s;e their under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="160" REF="163">
to give them a glymp&s;e of another world,
&s;uperior to the &s;en&s;ible, and while they take pains
to cheri&s;h and maintain the animal life, to teach
them not to neglect the intellectual.</P>
<P>331. Prevailing &s;tudies are of no &s;mall con&s;e|quence
to a &s;tate, the religion, manners and civil
government of a country ever taking &s;ome bias
from it's philo&s;ophy, which affects not only the
minds of its profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents, but al&s;o the
opinions of all the better &s;ort and the practice of
the whole people, remotely and con&s;equentially, in|deed,
though not incon&s;iderably. Have not the
polemic and &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy been ob&s;erved
to produce controver&s;ies in law and religion? And
have not Fatali&s;in and Sadduci&s;m gained ground,
during the general pa&s;&s;ion for the Corpu&s;cularian

for about a century? This indeed might u&s;efully
enough have employed &s;ome &s;hare of the lei&s;ure
and curio&s;ity of inqui&s;itive Per&s;ons. But when it
entered the &s;eminaries of learning as a nece&s;&s;ary ac|compli&s;hment,
and mo&s;t important part of educa|tion,
by engro&s;&s;ing men's thoughts, and fixing their

them for &s;piritual, moral, and intellectual matters.
Certainly had the philo&s;ophy of Socrates and Py|thagoras
prevailed in this Age, among tho&s;e who

332. IT might very well be thought &s;erious trifling
to tell my readers that the greate&s;t men had ever an
high e&s;teem for Plato; who&s;e writings are the touch|&s;tone
of a ha&s;ty and &s;hallow mind; who&s;e philo&s;ophy
has been the admiration of ages; which &s;upplied pa|triots,
magi&s;trates, and lawgivers to the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing
&s;tates, as well as fathers to the church, and
doctors to the &s;chools. Albeit in the&s;e days, the
depths of that old learning are rarely fathomed, and
yet it were happy for the&s;e lands, if our young nobi|lity
and gentry in&s;tead of modern maxims would im|bibe
the notions of the great men of antiquity. But
in the&s;e free-thinking times many an empty head is
&s;hook at Ari&s;totle and Plato, as well as at the holy
&s;criptures. And the writings of tho&s;e celebrated an|cients
are by mo&s;t men treated on a foot, with the
dry and barbarous lucubrations of the &s;choolmen. It
may be mode&s;tly pre&s;umed, there are not many
among us, even of tho&s;e who are called the better
&s;ort, who have more &s;en&s;e, virtue, and love of their
country than Cicero, who in a letter to Atticus could
not forbear exclaiming, O Socrates et Socratici viri!
nunquam vobis gratiam referam. Would to God
many of our countrymen had the &s;ame obligations to
tho&s;e Socratic writers. Certainly where the people
are well educated, the art of piloting a &s;tate is be&s;t
learned from the writings of Plato. But among bad
men void of di&s;cipline and education, Plato, Py$ha|goras
and Ari&s;totle them&s;elves, were they living,
could do but little good. Plato hath drawn a very
humorous and in&s;tructive picture of &s;uch a &s;tate; which
I &s;hall not tran&s;cribe for certain rea&s;ons. But whoever
has a mind, may fee i$ in the &s;eventy eighth page of
the &s;econd tome of A$dus his edition of Plato's works.</P>
<P>333. PROCLUS, in the fir&s;t book of his commentary
on the theology of Plato ob&s;erves that, as in the my|&s;teries,
tho&s;e who are initiated, at fir&s;t meet with ma|nifold
and multiform Gods, but being entered and
thoroughly initiated they receive the divine illumina|tion
<PB N="162" REF="165">
and participate the very deity: in like manner, if
the &s;oul look abroad &s;he beholds the &s;hadows and
images of things: but returning into her&s;elf &s;he un|ravels
and beholds her own e&s;&s;ence: At fir&s;t &s;he
&s;eemeth only to behold her &s;elf: But having pene|trated
farther &s;he di&s;covers the mind. And again,
&s;till farther advancing into the innermo&s;t &s;anctuary of
the &s;oul &s;he contemplates the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. And this,
he &s;aith, is the mo&s;t excellent of all human acts, in
the &s;ilence and repo&s;e of the faculties of the &s;oul to
tend upwards to the very divinity; to approach and
be clo&s;ely joined with that which is ineffable and &s;upe|perior
to all beings. When come &s;o high as the fir&s;t
principle &s;he ends her journey and re&s;ts. Such is the
doctrine of Proclus.</P>
<P>334. BUT Socrates in the fir&s;t Alcibiades teacheth on
the other hand, that the contemplation of God is the
proper means to know or under&s;tand our own &s;oul.
As the eye, &s;aith he, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the vi&s;ive
part or pupil of another eye beholds it's &s;elf, even &s;o
the Soul beholds and under&s;tands her &s;elf, while &s;he
contemplates the deity which is wi&s;dom and vertue or
like thereunto. In the Phaedon Socrates &s;peaks of
God as being <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">260, 320.</NOTE>, the good and
the decent: Plotinus repre&s;ents God as order: Ari&s;to|tle
as law.</P>
<P>335. IT may &s;eem perhaps to tho&s;e, who have
been taught to di&s;cour&s;e about &s;ub&s;tratums, more rea|&s;onable
and pious to attribute to the Deity a more &s;ub|&s;tantial
being, than the notional entities of wi&s;dom,
order, law, vertue, or goodne&s;s, which being only
complex ideas, $ramed and put together by the under|&s;tanding,
are its own creatures, and have nothing &s;ub|&s;tantial,
real, or independent in them. But it mu&s;t
be con&s;idered, that in the Platonic &s;y&s;tem, order,
vertue, law, goodne&s;s, and wi&s;dom are not creatures
of the &s;oul of man, but innate and originally exi&s;tent
therein, not as an accident in a &s;ub&s;tance, but as light
<PB N="163" REF="166">
to enlighten, and as a guide to govern. In Plato's
&s;tyle, the term idea doth not merely &s;ignify an inert
inactive object of the under&s;tanding, but is u&s;ed as
&s;ynonymous with <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, cau&s;e and principle.
According to that philo&s;opher, goodne&s;s, beauty,
vertue and &s;uch like are not &s;igments of the mind,
nor mere mixed modes, nor yet ab&s;tract ideas in the
modern &s;en&s;e, but the mo&s;t real beings, intellectual
and unchangeable; and therefore more real than the

&s;tability cannot be &s;ubjects of &s;cience<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">264, 266, 297.</NOTE>, much le&s;s
of intellectual knowledge.</P>
<P>336. BY Parmenides, Timaeus, and Plato a di|&s;tinction
was made, as hath been ob&s;erved already, be|tween
genitum and ens. The former &s;ort is always
a generating or in fieri<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">304, 306.</NOTE>, but never exi&s;ts, becau&s;e
it never continues the &s;ame, being in a con&s;tant
change, ever peri&s;hing and producing. By entia they
under&s;tand things remote from &s;en&s;e, invi&s;ible and in|tellectual,
which never changing are &s;till the &s;ame,
and may therefore be &s;aid truly to exi&s;t. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> which
is generally tran&s;lated &s;ub&s;tance, but more properly
e&s;&s;ence, was not thought to belong to things &s;en&s;ible
and corporeal, which have no &s;tability; but rather to
intellectual ideas though di&s;cerned with more difficulty,
and making le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion on a mind &s;tupified and
immer&s;ed in animal life, than gro&s;s objects that con|tinually
be&s;et and &s;ollicit our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>337. THE mo&s;t refined humane intellect exerted to
it's utmo&s;t reach can only &s;eize &s;ome imperfect glymp|&s;es
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">313, 330.</NOTE> of the divine ideas, ab&s;tracted from all things
$orporeal, &s;en&s;ible, and imaginable. Therefore Py|thagoras
and Plato treated them in a my&s;terious man|ner,
concealing rather than expo&s;ing them to vulgar
eyes; &s;o far were they from thinking&punc; that tho&s;e ab|&s;tract
things, although the mo&s;t real, were the fitte&s;t
to influence common minds, or become principles of
<PB N="164" REF="167">
knowledge, not to &s;ay duty and virtue, to the gene|rality
of Mankind.</P>
<P>338. ARISTOTLE and his followers have made a
mon&s;trous repre&s;entation of the Platonic ideas; and
&s;ome of Plato's own &s;chool have &s;aid very odd things
concerning them. But if that philo&s;opher him&s;elf was
not read only, but &s;tudied al&s;o with care, and made
his own interpreter, I believe the prejudice that now
lies again&s;t him would &s;oon wear off<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3$9, 313.</NOTE>, or be even
converted into a high e&s;teem for tho&s;e exalted notions
and fine hints, that &s;parkle and &s;hine throughout his
writings; which &s;eem to contain not only the mo&s;t
valuable learning of Athens and Greece, but al&s;o a
trea&s;ure of the mo&s;t remote traditions and early &s;cience
of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>339. IN the Timaeus of Plato mention is made of
ancient per&s;ons, authors of traditions, and the off|&s;pring
of the Gods. It is very remarkable, that in
the account of the creation contained in the &s;ame piece,
it is &s;aid that God was plea&s;ed with his work, and
that the night is placed before the day. The more
we think, the more difficult &s;hall we find it to con|ceive,
how mere man, grown up in the vulgar habits
of life, and weighed down by &s;en&s;uality, &s;hould ever
be able to arrive at &s;cience, without &s;ome tradition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">298, 301, 302.</NOTE>
or teaching, which might either &s;ow the &s;eeds of know|ledge,
or call forth and excite tho&s;e latent &s;eeds that
were originally &s;own in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>340. HUMANE &s;ouls in this low &s;ituation, bo$ $er|ing
on mere animal life, bear the weight and &s;ee
through the du&s;k of a gro&s;s atmo&s;phere, gathered
from wrong judgments daily pa&s;&s;ed, fal&s;e opinions
daily learned, and early habits of an older date than
either judgment or opinion. Through &s;uch a medium
the &s;harpe&s;t eye cannot &s;ee clearly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">292, 293, 294.</NOTE>. And if by
&s;ome extraordinary effort the mind &s;hould &s;urmount
this du&s;ky region&punc; and &s;natch a glymp&s;e of pure light,
<PB N="165" REF="168">
&s;he is &s;oon drawn backward and depre&s;&s;ed by the hea|vine&s;s
of the animal nature, to which &s;he is chained.
And if again &s;he chanceth, amid&s;t the agitation of
wild fancies and &s;trong affections, to &s;pring upwards,
a &s;econd relap&s;e &s;peedily &s;ucceeds into this region of
darkne&s;s and dreams.</P>
<P>341. NEVERTHELESS, as the mind gathers &s;trength
by repeated acts, we &s;hould not de&s;pond, but con|tinue
to exert the prime and flower of our faculties,
&s;till recovering, and reaching on, and &s;truggling into
the upper region, whereby our natural weakne&s;s and
blindne&s;s may be in &s;ome degree remedied, and a
ta&s;te attained of Truth and Intellectual Life. Be&s;ide
the con&s;tant prevailing opinion of the greate&s;t men of
antiquity, that there is both an univer&s;al &s;pirit author
of life and motion, and an univer&s;al mind enlighten|ing
and ordering all things, it was a rec$ived tenet
among them, that there is al&s;o <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">322.</NOTE>,
which they looked on as the fons deitatis, the fir&s;t hy|po&s;ta&s;is
in the d$vinity.</P>
<P>342. THE one or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, being immutable and indivi|&s;ible,
always the &s;ame and entire, was therefore thought
to exi&s;t truly and originally, and other things only &s;o
far as they are one and the &s;ame, by participation of
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. This give unity, &s;tability, reality to things<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">264, 306.</NOTE>.
Plato de&s;cribes God, as Mo&s;es, from his being. Ac|cording
to both, God is he who truly is, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Change and divi&s;ion were e&s;teemed defects or bad.
Evil &s;catters, divides, de&s;troys. Good, on the con|trary,
produceth concord and union, a&s;&s;embles, com|bines,
perfects, and pre&s;erves entire. The &s;everal be|ings
which compo&s;e the univer&s;e are parts of the &s;ame
&s;y&s;tem, they combine to carry on one end, and per|fect
one whole. And this aptne&s;s and concurrence
thereunto furni&s;hes the partial particular idea of Good
in the di&s;tinct creatures. Hence it might have come
<PB N="166" REF="169">
to pa&s;s, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> were regarded as one
and the &s;ame.</P>
<P>343. LIGHT and &s;ight (&s;aith Plato in the &s;ixth
book of his Republic) are not the Sun: even so truth
and knowledge are not the Good it &s;elf, although they
approach thereunto. And again, what the Sun is in
a visible place with re&s;pect to &s;ight and things &s;een,
that &s;ame is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or Good in an intelligible place,
with re&s;pect to under&s;tanding and things under&s;tood.
Therefore the good or one is not the light that en|lightens,
but the &s;ource of that light.</P>
<P>344. EVERY moment produceth &s;ome change in
the parts of this vi&s;ible creation. Something is added or
dimini&s;hed, or altered in e&s;&s;ence, quantity, quality, or
habitude. Wherefore all generated beings were &s;aid
by the ancients to be in a perpetual flux<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">304, 336.</NOTE> And that
which, on a confu&s;ed and general view, &s;eems one
&s;ingle con&s;tant being, &s;hall upon a nearer in&s;pection ap|pear
a continued &s;eries of different beings. But God
remains for ever one and the &s;ame. Therefore God
alone exi&s;ts. This was the doctrine of Heraclitus,
Plato, and other ancients.</P>
<P>345. IT is the opinion of Plato and his followers,
that in the &s;oul of man, prior and &s;uperior to intellect,
there is &s;omewhat of an higher nature, by virtue of
which we are one; and that by means of our one or
unite, we are mo&s;t clo&s;ely joined to the Deity. And,
as by our intellect we touch the divine intellect, even
&s;o by our <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or unite the very flower of our e&s;&s;ence,
as Proclus expre&s;&s;eth it, we touch the fir&s;t one.</P>
<P>346. ACCORDING to the Platonic philo&s;ophy, ens
and unum are the &s;ame. And con&s;equently our minds
participate &s;o far of exi&s;tence as they do of unity. But
it &s;hould &s;eem that per&s;onality is the indivi&s;ible center
of the &s;oul or mind, which is a monad &s;o far $orth as
&s;he is a per&s;on. Therefore Per&s;on is really that which
exi&s;ts, ina&s;much as it participates the divine unity.
<PB N="167" REF="170">
In man the monad or indivi&s;ible is the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the
&s;elf &s;ame &s;elf or very &s;elf, a thing, in the opinion of
Socrates, much and narrowly to be inquired into and
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, to the end that, knowing our&s;elves, we may
know what belongs to us and our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>347. UPON mature reflexion the per&s;on or mind, of
all created beings, &s;eemeth alone indivi&s;ible, and to
partake mo&s;t of unity. But &s;en&s;ible things are rather
con&s;idered as one than truly &s;o, they being in a per|petual
flux or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ever differing and various.
Neverthele&s;s, all things together may be con&s;idered
as one univer&s;e<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">287, 288.</NOTE>, one by the connexion, relation
and order of it's parts, which is the work of mind
who&s;e unite is by Platonics, &s;uppo&s;ed a participation
of the first <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>348. SOCRATES, in the Theaetetus of Plato, &s;peaketh
of two parties of philo&s;ophers, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
the flowing philo&s;ophers who held all
things to be in a perpetual flux, always a generating
and never exi&s;ting; and tho&s;e others who maintained
the univer&s;e to be fixed and immoveable. The diffe|rence
&s;eems to have been this, that Heraclitus, Pro|tagoras,
Empedocles, and in general tho&s;e of the for|mer
&s;ect, con&s;idered things &s;en&s;ible and natural;
whereas Parmenides and his party con&s;idered <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
not as the &s;en&s;ible but as the intelligible world<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">293, 294, 295.</NOTE>, ab|&s;tracted
from all &s;en&s;ible things.</P>
<P>349. IN effect if we mean by things the &s;en&s;ible
objects; the&s;e, it is evident, are always flowing; but
if we mean things purely intelligible, then we may &s;ay
on the other hand, with equal truth, that they are
immoveable and unchangeable. So that tho&s;e, who
thought the whole or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> to be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> a fixed or
permanent one, &s;eem to have under&s;tood the whole of
real beings, which in their &s;en&s;e was only the intel|lectual
world, not allowing reality of being to things
not permanent.</P>

350. THE di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;ome readers may perhaps
be incurred, by &s;urpri&s;ing them into certain reflexions
and inquiries for which they have no curio&s;ity. But
perhaps &s;ome others may be plea&s;ed, to find a dry
&s;ubject varied by digre&s;&s;ions, traced through remote
inferences, and carried into ancient times, who&s;e hoary
maxims<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">298, 301.</NOTE> &s;cattered in this e&s;&s;ay are not propo&s;ed as
principles, but barely as hints to awaken and exerci&s;e
the inqui&s;itive reader, on points not beneath the atten|tion
of the able&s;t men. Tho&s;e great men, Pythagoras,
Plato, and Ari&s;totle the mo&s;t con&s;ummate in politics,
who founded &s;tates, or in&s;tructed princes, or wrote
mo&s;t accurately on public government, were at the
&s;ame time mo&s;t acute at all ab&s;tracted and &s;ublime
Speculations; the cleare&s;t light being ever nece&s;&s;ary to
guide the mo&s;t important actions. And whatever the
world thinks, he who hath not much meditated upon
God, the Humane mind, and the Summum bonum,
may po&s;&s;ibly make an able earthworm, but will mo&s;t
indubitably make a &s;orry patriot and a &s;orry &s;tate&s;|man.</P>
<P>351. ACCORDING to the nice metaphy&s;ics of tho&s;e
ancient philo&s;ophers <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, being con&s;idered as what
was $ir&s;t and &s;imple&s;t in the deity, was pre&s;cinded even
from entity to which it was thought prior and &s;uperior&punc;
and is therefore by the Platonics &s;tyled &s;uper-e&s;&s;ential.
And in the Parmenides it is &s;aid, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> doth not exi&s;t;
which might &s;eem to imply a negation of the divine
being. The truth is, Zeno and Parmenides argued,
that a thing exi&s;ting in time was older and younger
than it &s;elf; therefore the con&s;tant immutable <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> did
not exi&s;t in time; and if not in time, then in none of
the differences of time pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come;
therefore we cannot &s;ay that it was, is, or will be.
But neverthele&s;s it is admitted in the &s;ame Parmenides,
that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is every where pre&s;ent to <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; that is,
in&s;tead of a temporary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of moments, there
<PB N="169" REF="172">
is one eternal now, or, punctum Stans, as it is t$rmed
by the Schoolmen.</P>
<P>352. THE &s;implicity of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (the father in the
Pythagoric and Platonic trinity) is conceived &s;uch as
to exclude intellect or mind, to which it is &s;uppo&s;ed
prior. And that hath created a &s;u&s;picion of athei&s;m
in this opinion. For, &s;aith the learned Doctor Cud|worth,
&s;hall we &s;ay that the fir&s;t hypo&s;ta&s;is or per&s;on
is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;en&s;ele&s;s and irrational, and alto|gether
devoid of mind and under&s;tanding? or would
not this be to introduce a kind of my&s;terious athei&s;m?
To which it may be an&s;wered, that whoever acknow|ledgeth
the univer&s;e to be made and governed by an
eternal mind, cannot be ju&s;tly deemed an athei&s;t<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">154, 276, 279, 287.</NOTE>.
And this was the tenet of tho&s;e ancient philo&s;ophers.
In the Platonic doctrine, the generation of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> was not contingent but nece&s;&s;ary, not temporary,
but from everla&s;ting. There never was a time &s;up|po&s;ed
wherein <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without intellect, the
priority having been understood only as a priority of
order and conception, but not a priority of age.
Therefore, the maintaining a di&s;tinction of priority
between <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> doth not infer, that the one
ever exi&s;ted without the other. It follows, therefore,
that the father or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> may, in a certain &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid
to be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> without athei&s;m, or without de&s;troying the
notion of a deity; any more than it would de&s;troy the
notion of a humane &s;oul, if we &s;hould conceive a di|&s;tinction
between &s;elf and intellect, or intellect and
life. To which we may farther add, that it is a doc|trine
of Platonics, and agrees with their ma&s;ter's te|nets,
that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or the fir&s;t hypo&s;ta&s;is contains all ex|cellence
and perfection whereof it is the original
Source, and is eminenter, as the Schools &s;peak, intel|lect
and life, as well as goodne&s;s; while the &s;econd
hypo&s;ta&s;is is e&s;&s;entially intellect, and by participation
goodne&s;s and life; and the third, life e&s;&s;entially,
<PB N="170" REF="173">
and by participation goodne&s;s and intellect.</P>
<P>353. THEREFORE, the whole being con&s;idered,
it will not &s;eem ju&s;t, to fix the imputation of athei&s;m
upon tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who held the doctrine of
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; whether it be taken in an ab&s;tracted or collec|tive,
a metaphy&s;ical or merely vulgar, meaning<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">300.</NOTE>;
that is, whether we pre&s;cind unity from e&s;&s;ence and
intellect, &s;ince metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions of the divine
attributes do not in reality divide them; or whether
we con&s;ider the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem of beings as one,
&s;ince the union, connexion, and order of it's mem|bers,
do manife&s;tly infer a mind or intellect to be
cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>354. THE one, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> may be conceived either
by compo&s;ition or divi&s;ion. For as, on the one hand,
we may &s;ay the world or univer&s;e is ONE whole or
ONE animal; &s;o we may, on the other hand, con&s;ider
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> by divi&s;ion or ab&s;traction, as &s;omewhat in the or|der
of things prior to mind. In either &s;en&s;e there is
no athei&s;m, &s;o long as mind is admitted to pre&s;ide
and direct the animal; and &s;o long as the unum or
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t without mind,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">287, 288.</NOTE>. So
that neither Heraclitus nor Parmenides, nor Pythago|ras
nor Plato, neither the Aegyptians nor Stoics, with
their doctrine of a divine whole or animal, nor Xeno|phanes
with his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, are ju&s;tly to be accounted
ath$i&s;ts. Therefore modern athei&s;m, be it of Hobbes,
Spino&s;a, Collins, or whom you will, is not to be
countenanced by the learned and great names of anti|quity.</P>
<P>355. PLATO teacheth, that the doctrine concerning
the one or unite is a means, to lead and rai&s;e the
mind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">29$, 295.</NOTE> to the knowledge of him who truly is.
And it is a tenet both of Ari&s;totle and Plato, that
identity is a certain unity. The Pythagoreans al&s;o, as
well as the Platonic philo&s;ophers, held unum and ens
<PB N="171" REF="174">
to be the &s;ame. Con&s;i&s;tently with which that only
can be &s;aid to exi&s;t, which is one and the &s;ame. In
things &s;en&s;ible and imaginable, as &s;uch, there &s;eems
to be no unity, nothing that may be called one prior
to all act of the mind; &s;ince they being in them&s;elves
aggregates, con&s;i&s;ting of parts or compounded of
elements&punc; are in effect many. Accordingly it is re|marked
by Themi&s;tius, the learned Interpreter of Ari|&s;totle,
that to collect many notions into one, and to
con&s;ider them as one, is the work of intellect, and
not of &s;en&s;e or fancy.</P>
<P>356. ARISTOTLE him&s;elf, in his third book of the
Soul, &s;aith it is the mind that maketh each thing to
be one, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. How this is
done, Themi&s;tius is more particular, ob&s;erving, that
as being conferreth e&s;&s;ence, the mind by virtue of her
simplicity conferreth &s;implicity upon compounded
beings. And, indeed, it &s;eemeth that the mind, &s;o
far forth as per&s;on, is individual<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">345, 346, 347.</NOTE> therein re&s;embling
the divine one by participation, and imparting to
other things what it &s;elf participates from above.
This is agreeable to the doctrine of the ancients, how|ever
the contrary opinion of &s;uppo&s;ing number to be
an original primary quality in things, independent of
the mind, may obtain among the moderns.</P>
<P>357. THE Peripatetics taught, that in all divi&s;ible
things there was &s;omewhat indivi&s;ible, and in all com|pounded
things &s;omewhat &s;imple. This they derived
from an act of the mind. And neither this &s;imple
indivi&s;ible unite, nor any &s;um of repeated unites, con|&s;equently
no number, can be &s;eparated from the things
them&s;elves and from the operation of the mind. The|mi&s;tius
goeth &s;o far as to affirm, that it cannot be &s;e|parated
from the words or &s;igns; and, as it cannot be
uttered without them, &s;o &s;aith he, neither can it be
conceived without them. Thus much upon the whole
<PB N="172" REF="175">
may be concluded, that di&s;tinct from the mind and
her operations, there is in created beings neither unite
nor number.</P>
<P>358. OF inferior beings the humane mind, &s;elf, or
per&s;on is the mo&s;t &s;imple and undivided e&s;&s;ence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">3$7.</NOTE>.
And the &s;upreme father is the mo&s;t perfect one. There|fore
the flight of the mind towards God is called by
the Platonics <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. The &s;upreme being,
&s;aith Plotinus, as he excludes all diver&s;ity, is ever
alike pre&s;ent. And we are then pre&s;ent to him, when,
recollected and ab&s;tracted from the world and &s;en|&s;ible
objects, we are mo&s;t free and di&s;engaged<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">268.</NOTE>
from all variety. He adds, that in the intuition of
the &s;upreme deity the &s;oul finds her wi&s;hed for end
and repo&s;e; which that philo&s;opher calls awaking out
of his body into him&s;elf.</P>
<P>359. IN the tenth book of the arcane, or divine
wi&s;dom of the Aegyptians, we are taught that the
&s;upreme being is not the cau&s;e of any created thing;
but that he produced or made the word; and that all
created beings were made by the word, which is ac|cordingly
&s;tyled the cau&s;e of all cau&s;es: and that this
was al&s;o the doctrine of the Chaldaeans. Plato, like|wi&s;e,
in his letter to Hermias, Era&s;tus, and Cori&s;cus,
&s;peaks of God the ruler and cau&s;e of all things as hav|ing
a father: And, in his Epinomis, he expre&s;ly
teacheth that the word or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> made the world. Ac|cordingly
Saint Augu&s;tine in his commentary on the
beginning of Saint John's Go&s;pel, having declared
that Chri&s;t is the wi&s;dom of God by which all things
were made, ob&s;erves that this doctrine was al&s;o found
in the writings of philo&s;ophers, who taught that
God had an only begotten Son by whom are all
things.</P>
<P>360. Now, though Plato had joined with an ima|gination
the mo&s;t &s;plendid and magnificent, an intel|lect
<PB N="173" REF="176">
not le&s;s deep and clear; yet it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed,
that either he or any other philo&s;ophers of
Greece or the Ea&s;t, had by the light of nature attained
an adequate notion of the Holy Trinity, nor even that
their imperfect notion, &s;o far as it went, was exactly
ju&s;t; nor perhaps that tho&s;e &s;ublime hints, which dart
forth like fla&s;hes of light in the mid&s;t of a profound
darkne&s;s, were originally &s;truck from the hard rock of
humane rea&s;on; but rather derived, at lea&s;t in part,
by a divine tradition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">298, 301.</NOTE> from the author of all things.
It &s;eems a remarkable confirmation of this, what Plo|tinus
ob&s;erves in his fifth ennead, that this doctrine of
a Trinity, father, mind, and &s;oul, was no late inven|tion,
but an ancient tenet.</P>
<P>361. CERTAIN it is, that the notion of a Trinity is
to be found in the writings of many old heathen philo|&s;ophers,
that is to &s;ay, a notion of three divine hypo|&s;ta&s;es.
Authority, light, and life did, to the eye of
Rea&s;on, plainly appear to &s;upport, pervade, and ani|mate
the mundane &s;y&s;tem or macroco&s;m. The &s;ame
appeared in the microco&s;m, pre&s;erving &s;oul and body,
enlightening the mind, and moving the affections.
And the&s;e were conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary univer&s;al
principles, coexi&s;ting, and co-operating in &s;uch &s;ort,
as never to exi&s;t a&s;under, but on the contrary to con|&s;titute
one Sovereign of all things. And, indeed,
how could power or authority avail or &s;ub&s;i&s;t without
knowledge? or either without life and action?</P>
<P>362. IN the admini&s;tration of all things there is
authority to e&s;tabli&s;h, law to direct, and ju&s;tice to
execute. There is fir&s;t the Source of all perfection, or
fons deitatis, &s;econdly the &s;upreme Rea&s;on, order, or
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and la&s;tly the Spirit which quickens and in&s;pires.
We are &s;prung from the father, irradiated or enlight|ened
by the &s;on, and moved by the &s;pirit. Certainly,
that there is father, &s;on, and &s;pirit; that the&s;e bear
<PB N="174" REF="177">
analogy to the &s;un, light, and heat; and are other|wi&s;e
expre&s;&s;ed by the terms, principle, mind, and
&s;oul; by one or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, intellect, and life; by good,
word, and love; and that generation was not attri|buted
to the &s;econd hypo&s;ta&s;is, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, in re|&s;pect
of time,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">352.</NOTE>, but only in re&s;pect of origine and
order, as an eternal nece&s;&s;ary emanation; the&s;e are
the expre&s;s tenets of Platoni&s;ts, Pythagoreans, Aegyp|tians,
and Chaldaeans.</P>
<P>363. THOUGH it may be well pre&s;umed there is
nothing to be found on that &s;ublime &s;ubject in hu|mane
writings, which doth not bear the &s;ure Signa|ture
of humanity; yet it cannot be denied, that &s;eve|ral
fathers of the church have thought fit to illu&s;trate
the chri&s;tian doctrine of the holy trinity, by &s;imi|litudes
and expre&s;&s;ions borrowed from the mo&s;t emi|nent
Heathens, whom they conceived to have been
no &s;trangers to that my&s;tery; as hath been plainly
proved by Be&s;&s;arion, Eugubinus, and Doctor Cud|worth.</P>
<P>364. THEREFORE, how unphilo&s;ophical &s;oever
that doctrine may &s;eem to many of the pre&s;ent age,
yet it is certain, the men of greate&s;t fame and learn|ing
among the ancient philo&s;ophers held a trinity in
the Godhead. It mu&s;t be owned, that upon this
point &s;ome later Platoni&s;ts of the Gentile world &s;eem
to have bewilder'd them&s;elves, (as many Chri&s;tians
have al&s;o done) while they pur&s;ued the hints de|rived
from their predece&s;&s;ors, with too much cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>365. BUT Plato him&s;elf con&s;idered that doctrine as
a venerable my&s;tery, not to be lightly treated of or
ra&s;hly divulged. Wherefore in a letter to Diony&s;ius
he writes (as he him&s;elf profe&s;&s;eth) aenigmatically and
briefly in the following terms, which he giveth for a
&s;ummary of his notion concerning the &s;upreme Being,
<PB N="175" REF="178">
and which being capable of divers &s;en&s;es, I leave to be
decyphered by the learned reader. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
Plato enjoins Diony&s;ius over and over,
with great earne&s;tne&s;s not to &s;uffer, what he commu|nicates
concerning the my&s;tery of the divine Nature,
to fall into illiterate or vulgar hands, giving it withal
as a rea&s;on for this caution, that nothing would &s;eem
more ridiculous or ab&s;urd to the common run of man|kind.
He adds, that in regard writings might mi&s;|carry,
the prudent way was to write nothing at all on
tho&s;e matters, but to teach and learn them by word of
mouth: for which rea&s;on, &s;aith he, I have never
wrote any thing thereon; nor is there, nor &s;hall there
ever be any thing of Plato's, extant on that &s;ubject.
He farther adds, as for what hath been now &s;aid, it
belongs all to Socrates.</P>
<P>366. AND, indeed, what this philo&s;opher in his
Phaedrus &s;peaketh of the &s;uper-coele&s;tial region, and
the divinity re&s;ident therein, is of a &s;train not to be
reli&s;hed or comprehended by vulgar minds; to wit,
e&s;&s;ence really exi&s;tent, object of intellect alone, with|out
colour, without figure, without any tangible qua|lity.
He might very ju&s;tly conceive that &s;uch a de|&s;cription
mu&s;t &s;eem ridiculous to &s;en&s;ual men.</P>
<P>367. As for the perfect intuition of divine things,
that he &s;uppo&s;eth to be the lot of pure &s;ouls, behold|ing
by a pure light, initiated, happy, free and un|&s;tained
from tho&s;e bodies, wherein we are now im|pri&s;oned
like oy&s;ters. But in this mortal &s;tate, we
mu&s;t be &s;atisfy'd to make the be&s;t of tho&s;e glymp&s;es
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">335, 337.</NOTE> within our reach. It is Plato's remark in his
Theaetetus, that while we &s;it &s;till we are never the
wi&s;er, but going into the river and moving up and
down, is the way to di&s;cover its depths and &s;hallows.
<PB N="176" REF="179">
If we exerci&s;e and be&s;tir our &s;elves, we may even here
di&s;cover &s;omething.</P>
<P>368. THE eye by long u&s;e comes to &s;ee even in the
darke&s;t cavern: and there is no &s;ubject &s;o ob&s;cure, but
we may di&s;cern &s;ome glymp&s;e of truth by long poring
on it. Truth is the cry of all but the game of a few.
Certainly where it is the chief pa&s;&s;ion, it doth not give
way to vulgar cares and views; nor is it contented
with a little ardour in the early time of life, active,
perhaps, to pur&s;ue, but not &s;o fit to weigh and revi&s;e.
He that would make a real progre&s;s in knowledge,
mu&s;t dedicate his age as well as youth, the later growth
as well as fir&s;t fruits, at the altar of Truth.</P>
