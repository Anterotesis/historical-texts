<P>_WHAT a &s;trange man this is, my
Cecilia! The more I reflect on his
conduct, the more I am amazed!
What a mixture is there in his Na|ture!
Wild to a romantic de|gree
in his conceptions, yet how &s;teady, how
re&s;olute, how con&s;i&s;tent, in putting tho&s;e
flights of fancy into act! Generous he cer|tainly
is; how few men would put them|&s;elves
to the trouble and expence that he has
done, from &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;uch a com|pa&s;&s;ionate
motive! Nay, on the contrary, I
<PB N="2" REF="3">
believe mo&s;t men would be cruel enough to
take a &s;ort of plea&s;ure in the vexation of a
man, who had &s;ucceeded to the love of a
Mi&s;tre&s;s, once &s;o much valued; and would
enjoy a mean triumph in being, though with|out
rea&s;on, the object of <HI>his</HI> jealou&s;y, who
had cut them off from all hope.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland is above this. I think my|&s;elf
highly indebted to him, whether the
&s;cheme he has in &s;o extraordinary a manner
undertaken for my Service &s;ucceeds or not.
Yet do I wi&s;h from my heart, that the &s;e|paration
between Mr. Arnold and Mrs. Ger|rarde
had been brought about by any other
means. What if Mr. Arnold &s;hould ever
come at the truth (though I think that hardly
po&s;&s;ible) might it not leave him more e&s;tran|ged
from me than he is even now? Or if
he &s;hould, in con&s;equence of this odd ad|venture,
return to his poor bani&s;hed wife,
repent of his injurious &s;u&s;picions of her, and
re&s;tore her to his confidence and love, can
he, can he ever re&s;tore to her that peace &s;he
has &s;o long been a &s;tranger to? Will no
latent &s;parks of former unkindne&s;s ever re|kindle
and light up the fire of di&s;cord? How
unwillingly do we repair the unprovoked in|juries
which we find we have done to others!
Poor Mr. Arnold; if I am &s;o happy as to
have my innocence cleared to him, how mi|&s;erable
will his own reflections make him!
But if he <HI>is</HI> convinced (which has been my
<PB N="3" REF="4">
daily and hourly prayers), he <HI>&s;hall</HI> not be
unhappy, if I can make him otherwi&s;e. Oh!
my dear, it is the wi&s;h, the ardent longing
of my &s;oul, to recover the e&s;teem, though I
lo&s;e the love, of Mr. Arnold! for I call that
Being to witne&s;s, who knows the &s;ecrets of
all hearts, that &s;ince I have been his wife, I
have never, even in thought, &s;werved from
that perfect and inviolable fidelity which I
vowed to him. What then mu&s;t have been
my &s;ufferings, deprived of his love, ca&s;t out
from his hou&s;e, and branded with the dread|ful
name of an Adultre&s;s? For where is the
difference between the intention and the Act?
To me there is no di&s;tinction, and the hu&s;|band
mu&s;t be gro&s;s that makes one.</P>
<P>My mother has &s;uffered me to tell her the
&s;ub&s;tance of Mr. Falkland's letters, tho'
&s;he would not read them. I own I was
better &s;atisfied that &s;he &s;hould receive her
information thus, becau&s;e his light manner
of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in many places would
have given her great offence. Sir George did
not con&s;ider this when he &s;ubmitted the let|ters
to my mother's as well as my peru&s;al.
Many grave animadver&s;ions did &s;he make
during my recital, and many Times lift up
her Eyes in wonder at Mrs. Gerrarde's be|haviour.
She often &s;aid Mr. Faulkland was
frantic to undertake &s;uch a thing, and wi&s;hed
he had not taken &s;uch a <HI>terrible</HI> woman in
hand. When I came to that part of the ac|count
<PB N="4" REF="5">
where Mrs. Gerrarde had been pre|vailed
on to write to Mr. Arnold, I begged
&s;he would give me leave to read the copy
of the letter to her, as I a&s;&s;ured her there
was nothing in it but what would give her
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She con&s;ented; and I read it, leaving out
Mr. Faulkland's apo&s;trophes. My mother
did not interrupt me; and finding &s;he con|tinued
&s;ilent when I came to the conclu&s;ion,
I looked at her, and &s;aw tears running down
her cheeks. Yes, my dear, my innocent
child, &s;aid &s;he, pa&s;&s;ionately throwing her
arms round me, you <HI>were</HI> wronged; God
knows you were wronged; and He now
proclaims your innocence, even from the
mouth of your mo&s;t inveterate enemy. And
lifting up her eyes, Thou ha&s;t turned the
hearts of &s;inners to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t;
therefore &s;hall the righteous give Thee thanks.
And then, God forgive that woman all her
&s;ins for this one act, and God forgive Mr.
Faulkland <HI>his</HI> &s;ins, and reward him for this
goodne&s;s. Sure your husband will relent
now; &s;ure he will long to take my poor,
for&s;aken, virtuous child (and her tears gu&s;h|ed
as &s;he &s;poke), to his bo&s;om again.</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer her for &s;ome time;
my own tears almo&s;t choaked me: at la&s;t I
&s;aid, My dear mother, I have no doubt of
Mr. Arnold's returning kindne&s;s: he will,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
I hope, be convinced that I am guiltle&s;s, and
we may yet be happy.</P>
<P>She dried her eyes: God &s;end, God &s;end
you may! But what has Mr. Faulkland
done with, his poor penitent? I hope he
will behave honourably to her; for this ex|cellent
parent had no doubt but that the
letter, written by Mrs. Gerrarde, was, in a
great mea&s;ure, the re&s;ult of her own con|trition;
for as I had not been minute in
giving her a particular account of all the
previous &s;teps taken by Mr. Faulkland to
obtain it from her, &s;he had not the lea&s;t
idea that Mrs. Gerrarde had writ in that
manner from any other motive than the
good one which appeared obvious to her.</P>
<P>I told her, that I feared Mrs. Gerrarde
was far from being the penitent &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed
her; and then acquainted her with the true
rea&s;ons which had induced her to write in
the manner &s;he had done. I then proceed|ed
to tell her of her behaviour after writing
the letter, and how Mr. Faulkland had act|ed
in con&s;equence of that; concluding with
informing her of Mrs. Gerrarde's being mar|ried,
and provided for in a very reputable
way.</P>
<P>My mother was highly delighted at this
la&s;t circum&s;tance; for, &s;he &s;aid, M. Faulk|land
had no right to be the puni&s;her of her
crimes; and if he had not made a decent
provi&s;ion for her, &s;he would never have
<PB N="6" REF="7">
looked upon him but as a di&s;hone&s;t per&s;on.</P>
<P>She told me, that though &s;he was very
glad, upon the whole, that Mr. Arnold and
that bad woman were &s;eparated, yet &s;he was
neverthele&s;s not quite &s;o well &s;atisfied with
the manner of it; for I think, &s;aid &s;he, that
it <HI>is</HI> impo&s;&s;ible but that a man of Mr. Ar|nold's
good &s;en&s;e mu&s;t, one time or other, have
been convinced of his error, and, of his own
accord, returned to a right way of thinking.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that might po&s;&s;ibly have hap|pened:
but that he might have continued
long enough under his infatuation intirely to
ruin his family: and as for what regarded
me in particular, I knew of no means &s;o like|ly
to remove his unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions effectually,
as tho&s;e which Mr. Faulkland had taken.</P>
<P>You are right, my dear, &s;aid &s;he; let us
hope the be&s;t. I am glad Mr. Faulkland
does not mean to return &s;oon to England:
there is but one event which could ever re|concile
me to his doing &s;o; and that is, in
order to do ju&s;tice to the unfortunate Mi&s;s
Burchell. If he would wipe out that blot
in his Character by marrying her, I &s;hould
again allow him to be a good man: at pre&s;ent,
I own, I can't help being di&s;&s;atisfied, that
one, &s;o blameable as I think him, &s;hould
have laid my daughter under the obligations
which he has done.</P>
<P>I &s;aid it would rejoice me if he could be
prevailed on to make Mi&s;s Burchell the repa|ration
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;he mentioned; but I feared &s;he
had no advocate with Mr. Faulkland; tho'
I was of opinion, if he were made acquaint|ed
with the life of &s;orrow &s;he led, as well as
her re&s;erved and mode&s;t behaviour, he would
be inclined to favour her; e&s;pecially if he
were to &s;ee the poor little boy.</P>
<P>My mother &s;aid, he never could expect
quiet of mind, till he had wiped the tears
from her eyes.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Burchell came in while we were &s;peak|ing
of her: my mother is always glad to &s;ee
her. The poor girl had been exceedingly
&s;hocked at Mr. Faulkland's carrying away her
aunt. She thought this action put &s;uch an in|vincible
bar between her and her hopes (al|mo&s;t
de&s;perate before), that it went near to
di&s;tract her; for though there was no con&s;an|guinity
in the ca&s;e, yet the degree of relation|&s;hip
between her and Mrs. Gerrarde, made
her look upon this amour (for &s;o &s;he con&s;i|dered
it) with the utmo&s;t horror. She had of|ten
expre&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;e of it in &s;o lively a man|ner,
both to my mother and me, that had
Mr. Faulkland even been inclined to offer
her his hand, &s;he could not, con&s;i&s;tently ei|ther
with virtue or common decency, have
accepted of it.</P>
<P>My mother, ever delighted with acts of
humanity, was in ha&s;te to communicate the
true &s;tate of the ca&s;e to Mi&s;s Burchell. It
was her intere&s;t to keep our &s;ecret; therefore
<PB N="8" REF="9">
I made no &s;cruple of tru&s;ting her with it;
e&s;pecially as I knew it would &s;o much con|tribute
to her peace of mind.</P>
<P>My mother acco&s;ted her with &s;aying, Mi&s;s
Burchell, I have &s;omething to tell you, that I
believe will give you plea&s;ure. The unhappy
young woman lifted up her melancholy eyes;
and, &s;haking her head, an&s;wered, <HI>That</HI> I be|lieve,
Madam, is now impo&s;&s;ible. Your aunt
is married, &s;aid my mother, but not to Mr.
Faulkland; and, what is more, there has ne|ver
any thing pa&s;&s;ed between them that need
be a bar to you, if he could be brought to
con&s;ider you as he ought. Mi&s;s Burchell
looked amazed; then turned her eyes from
my mother to me, as if for an explanation.
My mother de&s;ired me to acquaint her with
the hi&s;tory at large of Mr. Faulkland's pro|ceedings;
I did &s;o, and took care not to
omit the tender manner in which he had
mentioned her in one of his letters. She
dropped &s;ome tears at the recital; and then,
turning to my mother, My dear good Ma|dam,
you have &s;natched me from de&s;pair by
this di&s;covery: I was over whelmed; I think I
could not have got the better of my grief:
a faint ray of glimmering hope is once more
let in upon me. Mr. Faulkland may <HI>yet</HI> be
mine without a crime; or, if he is not, I &s;hall
at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction to think him not
&s;o abandoned as he appeared to me an hour
ago. Oh! worthy and lovely Mrs. Arnold!
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, you &s;ee
how Mr. Faulkland reveres you: oh! that
you would but engage in my behalf! <HI>you</HI>
can influence his heart; <HI>you</HI> can guide his
rea&s;on; <HI>you</HI> are his fate!</P>
<P>Her fine eyes, which &s;he fixed on me, filled
with per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, let me into the
whole of her meaning, and conveyed more
to me than it was in the power of words to do.
I under&s;tand you, dear Madam, &s;aid I; and it
grieves my heart to think that I cannot, mu&s;t
not intere&s;t my&s;elf for you in the manner I
would mo&s;t ardently undertake to do, if there
were not &s;uch ob&s;tacles in my way, as it is im|po&s;&s;ible
for me to get over. Mr. Faulkland,
you &s;ee, is free from the guilt we all feared he
had plunged him&s;elf into: he is full of re|mor&s;e
for the injury he did you, and I dare
believe, retains in his heart a tender &s;en&s;e of
your merit: he is &s;till free; nay, he has de|clared
his intention of continuing &s;o. The&s;e
circum&s;tances give large room for hope: your
unobjectionable conduct, joined to paternal
affection, may &s;till bring about that wi&s;hed|for,
happy event; but this mu&s;t be left to
time, and the workings of his own heart. You
know Mr. Faulkland is, in his natural temper,
impatient of re&s;traint; he is but a very young
man, and has a few of tho&s;e levities which a
little more &s;ettled age infallibly will correct,
where a good heart and a good under&s;tand|ing
are united. Pardon me if I add, that
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Mr. Faulkland is not ungenerous, however
blameable he may have been in regard to you.
All the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered, I &s;ay, may
warrant your indulging a hope, that he will at
la&s;t be brought to make you the reparation,
which is mine and my mother's wi&s;h as much
as your own. Ah! Madam, &s;aid &s;he, but
Mr. Faulkland is a great way from me: the
remembrance of me is already but too much
worn out; di&s;tance, time, and a variety of
objects, mu&s;t intirely efface it. <HI>Your</HI> hand,
the powerful magic of <HI>your</HI> touch, would &s;oon
brighten up the colouring of tho&s;e faint,
faded traces, that he but &s;carcely pre&s;erves of
me in his memory. What could not your
pen, guided by a heart &s;o tender, &s;o &s;ympa|thizing
with the grief of others, effect on the
man who con&s;iders you as a divinity? If he
had any hopes of <HI>you,</HI> Madam, it would be
pre&s;umption in me to put in my claim; but,
as you cannot be my rival, be my advocate:
do, dear angelic lady! (and &s;he lifted up her
hands to me fervently) write to Mr. Faulk|land;
if you can re&s;tore him to me, what
prayers will I not pour out for your happi|ne&s;s?</P>
<P>My mother, who was greatly affected at
her di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid to me, indeed, my dear,
if you could effect that, it would be a very
meritorious work. Who knows what the high
opinion Mr. Faulkland has of you, and the
great deference he pays to your judgment,
may produce?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
I was &s;orry my good mother's openne&s;s
of heart had made her enter &s;o &s;uddenly in|to
Mi&s;s Burchell's &s;entiments: it encouraged
her to renew her intreaties; &s;he &s;natched
both my mother's hands, and ki&s;&s;ed them;
&s;he wanted words to thank her.</P>
<P>I was unwilling to appear cold in Mi&s;s
Burchell's intere&s;t, or to refu&s;e doing what
my mother &s;eemed to approve; but the re|&s;olution
I had long before made, never to
&s;ee, or on any account what&s;oever to hold the
lea&s;t corre&s;pondence with Mr. Faulkland, de|termined
me. If &s;trict prudence might on &s;o
extraordinary an occa&s;ion have di&s;pen&s;ed with
this promi&s;e, which, as I had made it to my
own heart, I thought amounted almo&s;t to a
vow, I could not however an&s;wer it to that
decorum, which I had, as an inviolable law,
determined to guide my&s;elf by, in &s;o critical
a &s;ituation. And I re&s;olved to have it in my
power to &s;ay, in cafe Mr. Arnold and I were
ever to unite again, that I had not in the &s;mall|e&s;t
article departed from it.</P>
<P>I told Mi&s;s Burchell there was but one rea|&s;on
which could prevent me from complying
with her reque&s;t; but it was one of &s;o much
weight with me, that, after my informing her
of it, I hoped &s;he would be &s;o good as not to
urge me farther. I did, &s;aid I, upon my
parting with my hu&s;band, make a firm re|&s;olution,
not only never to &s;ee Mr. Faulkland,
but never to receive from, or write a line to
<PB N="12" REF="13">
him, nor in any manner what&s;oever to keep
up the lea&s;t intercour&s;e with him.</P>
<P>I did not know but that Mr. Faulkland (if
he &s;hould learn the truth) con&s;idering him&s;elf
to be (as he really was, though innocently)
the cau&s;e of that unfortunate &s;eparation,
might, either with a de&s;ign of con&s;oling me,
or of vindicating him&s;elf from any &s;u&s;picion
of blame, have endeavoured to &s;ee me or write
to me. In this I was mi&s;taken; his prudence,
or his re&s;pect for me, prevented him from
attempting either. The re&s;olution I had made,
however, I thought due to, my hu&s;band's ho|nour,
as well as my own, The &s;ame cau&s;e
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; the weight of it perhaps more
in my own imagination than in reality; but
if it even be &s;o, indulge me, dear Madam
(to my mother), and dear Mi&s;s Burchell, in
this &s;ingularity. I have (not improbably),
the happy pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to Mr.
Arnold's e&s;teem; let me then be able to a&s;|&s;ure
him, that the&s;e eyes, the&s;e ears, the&s;e
hands, have been as guiltle&s;s as my heart, and
all equally e&s;tranged from Mr. Faulkland.
This is a declaration I think due to that
punctilio, or, give me leave to call it, that
delicacy, I have endeavoured to pre&s;erve in
all my conduct. Mother! you always taught
me to avoid even the &s;hadow of reproach.</P>
<P>Very true, my deare&s;t, an&s;wered my mo|ther;
I believe you are in the right. Mi&s;s
Burchell, I think my daughter cannot, con|formably
<PB N="13" REF="14">
to that di&s;cretion by which &s;he has
always been governed, undertake your cau&s;e
at pre&s;ent: it did not appear to me at fir&s;t
in the light wherein Sidney has, now put it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Burchell made no an&s;wer, but by her
tears; we were both affected, and I wi&s;hed
&s;incerely to have had it in my power to &s;erve
her. I told her, if Mr. Arnold and I &s;hould
ever be re-united, that I would endeavour
to draw him &s;o far over to our party, as to
obtain his permi&s;&s;ion to corre&s;pond with Mr.
Faulkland: that I was &s;ure he would join
with me in wi&s;hing her the reparation &s;he
hoped for; and that I would make no
&s;cruple of engaging warmly for her in &s;uch a
ca&s;e. But then, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, with what
face can you intere&s;t your&s;elf for me, &s;o long
as Mr. Arnold &s;hall think that my aunt has
been criminal with Mr. Faulkland? That
thought, &s;aid I, did not occur to me before,
and is indeed a difficulty; for &s;hould Mr.
Arnold know that the elopement of Mrs.
Gerrarde was again&s;t her will, and the let|ter
&s;he wrote him extorted from her by
Mr. Faulkland, it might perhaps injure me
as much in his opinion, as Mrs. Gerrarde's
fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions had done before. Tho&s;e in|tricacies,
dear Mi&s;s Burchell, mu&s;t be left to
time; which I hope may unravel them fa|vourably
for us all. The attempt to di&s;|clo&s;e
this affair to Mr. Arnold mu&s;t not be
&s;udden; Indeed I mu&s;t be well a&s;&s;ured of
<PB N="14" REF="15">
his re&s;tored confidence and affection before I
can venture upon it at all. Whenever that joy|ful
event happens, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of my be&s;t
endeavours to &s;erve you, if I have really any
influence over Mr. Faulkland, and circum|&s;tances
&s;hould &s;o happily concur as to put
it in my power to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Be contented, good Mi&s;s Burchell, &s;aid my
mother, with this promi&s;e which my daughter
has made you: if Mr. Arnold and &s;he &s;hould
live together again, Mr. Faulkland may pro|bably
return to England; as nothing I be|lieve
now keeps him abroad, but to avoid
giving Mr. Arnold umbrage, in the pre&s;ent
unhappy di&s;union between him and his
wife.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 18.&mdash;My brother continues
&s;ullen; he &s;eldom vi&s;its us, and when he
does, the meeting on his part is cold. He
has made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of many particu|lars
relating to poor Mr. Arnold's unhappy
connection with Mrs. Gerrarde; for &s;ince
her elopement the affair has been more talk|ed
of than it was before, and her whole hi|&s;tory
traced out. She was the daughter of an
innkeeper in a country town, and ran away
with captain Gerrarde, in his march through
it, upon an acquaintance of but a few days.
The hu&s;band, who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of
her, concealed the meanne&s;s of her birth,
and put her off to his relations for a young
lady of a reputable family, with whom he
<PB N="15" REF="16">
got a good fortune. This induced his &s;i&s;ter,
a widow lady, the mother of Mi&s;s Burchell,
to leave at her death the care of the un|happy
girl to captain Gerrarde. The cap|tain,
who&s;e infirmities increa&s;ed fa&s;t upon
him a few years after his marriage, got leave
to retire upon half-pay into the country; and
he lived for the mo&s;t part at A&s;hby, a little
e&s;tate which he had purcha&s;ed and &s;ettled
upon his wife: it &s;eems he had a pretty good
per&s;onal fortune, which &s;he had &s;quandered,
for his fondne&s;s could refu&s;e her nothing, ex|cept
living apart from him at London, which
he could never con&s;ent to, though it was al|ways
her de&s;ire; but being debarred of this,
&s;he betook her&s;elf to &s;uch plea&s;ures as the
country afforded, and was always a leading
woman at hor&s;e-races, a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;uch
other amu&s;ements, as were within her reach;
which, together with expen&s;ive treats at home,
and card-playing (her &s;upreme delight) left
her at his death, which happened about five
years after their marriage, in the indigent &s;tate
&s;he in her account of her&s;elf to Mr. Faulkland
acknowledges. It was then Mr. Arnold be|came
acquainted with her, and in the manner
&s;he repre&s;ented; for my brother has lately
fallen into the acquaintance of that very <HI>rela|tion</HI>
(as &s;he calls him) which &s;he mentions,
a Mr. Pinnick, at who&s;e lodgings they fir&s;t
met. This gentleman, who was in reality
nothing more than an humble &s;ervant of the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
lady's, though &s;he called him cou&s;in, the
better to &s;kreen a more particular connecti|on,
was &s;o provoked at her de&s;erting him
in favour of Mr. Arnold, whom he &s;aid he
was &s;ure &s;he had in&s;nared, that he made no
&s;cruple of telling all he knew of her. He
&s;aid, &s;he had two brothers, very great pro|fligates;
one of whom had been put into pri|&s;on
for forgery, and would have been hang|ed,
had not Mr. Arnold, at the expence of
a very con&s;iderable &s;um, &s;aved his life. The
other, &s;ome very mean retainer to the law,
a plau&s;ible fellow, and Mrs. Gerrarde's great
favourite, for whom &s;he had art and in&s;luence
enough to prevail on Mr. Arnold to purcha&s;e
a con&s;iderable employment. It would be
endle&s;s, &s;aid Mr. Pinnick, to tell you the
variety of &s;tratagems, &s;he made u&s;e of to get
money out of tho&s;e whom &s;he had in her
power, and who were able to &s;upply her.
I, for my part, was not rich enough for her,
which was the chief rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e of Mr.
Arnold's &s;upplanting me; and I take it for
granted, that tho&s;e arts, which &s;he practi&s;ed
on me to little effect, &s;ucceeded better with
him. One time her poor father was in gaol,
and his whole family would be undone, and
her mother &s;ent a begging, if he was not
relieved from his di&s;tre&s;s, by a trifling &s;um;
fifty pounds would do. Another time her
&s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band, a country &s;hopkeeper, was
upon the point of breaking, and would be
<PB N="17" REF="18">
inevitably ruined if he was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And
then &s;he had a formal letter to produce from
her &s;i&s;ter upon the melancholy occa&s;ion.
The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;he made no &s;cruple
of laying open to me, as &s;he knew I was no
&s;tranger to her origin, having re&s;ided for
&s;ome years in the town where &s;he formerly
lived, though I did not then know her. Her
mother was a Roman Catholick; and in
order to have her daughter brought up in
the &s;ame principles with her&s;elf, had &s;ent her
to a relation in Dublin, where &s;he received
her education in a nunnery. Though her
artifices to get money from me were grown
quite &s;tale, I make no doubt but &s;he practi|&s;ed
them all over again on poor Arnold.
She was rot contented with the lodgings
I had placed her in, but obliged him to take
a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, elegantly furni&s;hed for
her: a very fine chariot and hor&s;es were the
next purcha&s;e; for a hired one the lady
would not vouch&s;afe to &s;it in: and I am
&s;ure I have &s;een her in the boxes at the play,
with as many jewels on her as any lady
there.</P>
<P>All the&s;e ungrateful particulars, which Sir
George had received from Mr. Pinnick, he
took a &s;ort of ill-natured plea&s;ure in repeating
to my mother and me. Unhappy Mr. Ar|nold,
into what a gulph did&s;t thou unwarily
plunge thy&s;elf! Is it not amazing that this
affair was even &s;o long a &s;ecret? That it was
<PB N="18" REF="19">
&s;o to <HI>me</HI> is not &s;trange; for it is natural to
&s;uppo&s;e that I mu&s;t have been the la&s;t per&s;on
to receive a hint of this nature; but that
my brother &s;hould never have been informed
of it is &s;urprizing! 'Tis certain Mr. Arnold
was at fir&s;t very cautious in his vi&s;its, make|ing
them generally at night, and even then
he never was carried in his own chariot. I
am &s;hocked to think of the mi&s;chiefs which
I fear he has done to his temporal affairs,
for his ch$ldren's &s;ake as well as his own;
but &s;ince he is delivered from the thraldom
in which this woman held him, the re&s;t, I
hope, by future good management, may be
retrieved. Would to heaven! I had nothing
left me to lament, but the wa&s;te of his for|tune.
Sir George &s;ays he is &s;ure he is deeply
in debt. The law-&s;uit too I hear is likely to
go again&s;t us; if that is to be the ca&s;e, it will
be a blow indeed!</P>
<P><HI>December.</HI> 19.&mdash;How mi&s;erable is a
&s;tate of &s;u&s;pence! I am, if po&s;&s;ible, more
unhappy now, than when I was without
hope of recovering my dear, and now more
dear, becau&s;e undone Mr. Arnold. Our
cau&s;e came to a final hearing many days ago
(though I was not told it 'till this morn|ing),
and only prepared for it ye&s;terday,
and it is given again&s;t us. Mr. Arnold by
this &s;troke lo&s;es 900 pounds a year, be&s;ides
con&s;iderable co&s;ts. Nothing now remains
but my jointure. Into what an aby&s;s of
<PB N="19" REF="20">
mi&s;ery is my unfortunate hu&s;band plunged!
Oh! that I could but &s;ee him! that I could
but regain his con&s;idence, that I might &s;ooth
and comfort him in his afflictions!</P>
<P>My brother is very unkind; after telling
me the fatal news, he &s;aid, he thought I &s;hould
be very much to blame if I returned to Mr.
Arnold, though he were even de&s;irous of it,
What pro&s;pect can you have with him but
beggary? &s;aid he; for I &s;uppo&s;e his next
&s;tep will be to wheedle you out of your join|ture,
the only &s;upport you have now left $or
your&s;elf and your children.</P>
<P>Oh! brother, brother, &s;aid I, you have
no heart! I could &s;ay no more, for I bur&s;t
into tears.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may not be put to the trial,
an&s;wered he cruelly; but if you &s;hould, you
are to take your own way, Mrs. Arnold, for my
advice had never any weight with you or my
mother.</P>
<P>My mother replied, Sir George, you do
not u&s;e either me or your &s;i&s;ter well. Let
her, in the name of God, follow the dictates
of her duty. If the unfortunate Mr. Arnold
&s;ees his error, can you be &s;o unchri&s;tian as
to endeavour at &s;teeling his wife's heart a|gain&s;t
him? O &s;on! this is not the way to
obtain forgivene&s;s of God for your own
faults! Far be it from Sidney to reject the
proffered love of a repenting hu&s;band. My
dear (to me) don't, afflict your&s;elf; if your
<PB N="20" REF="21">
hu&s;band has grace, you &s;hall both be as
happy together as <HI>I</HI> can make you. Misfor|tunes,
&s;aid Sir George, are mighty great pro|moters
of <HI>grace;</HI> I don't doubt but Mr. Ar|nold
will repent mo&s;t heartily&mdash;the having
lavi&s;hed away his fortune; and the hopes of
repairing it, may give him the <HI>grace</HI> to take
his wife again.</P>
<P>Sir George, &s;aid my mother angrily, you
will oblige me if you &s;ay no more on the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have done, madam, &s;aid my brother, and
took his leave.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell yon by what
means the widow Arnold carried her &s;uit
again&s;t us. You may remember I informed
you &s;he had at the beginning threatened to
produce a witne&s;s, who could prove that her
late hu&s;band had been with her on a particu|lar
night, a very little time before his death.
Who this witne&s;s was, had been kept an im|penetrable
&s;ecret. She did, however pro|duce
him, when the cau&s;e came to be tried;
and this witne&s;s proved to be Mrs. Gerrarde's
brother. That very brother whom Mr.
Arnold had redeemed from a gaol and peril
of hanging. This man it &s;eems had been
very intimate with her during her hu&s;band's
life-time, while &s;he was in a &s;tate of &s;epa|ration
from him: but whether he was at all
acquainted with, the late Mr. Arnold, we
have no other te&s;timony than his own. 'Tis
<PB N="21" REF="22">
however mo&s;t certain, that &s;he was &s;u&s;pected
of an intrigue with him, and in all human
probability that child, which is to inherit the
Arnold e&s;tate, is his.</P>
<P>This concealed villain undoubtedly was
the per&s;on who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this vile at|tempt
to her, and &s;ecretly abetted her in all
her proceedings. It was after the commence|ment
of the law-&s;uit that he was put into
gaol, and Mr. Arnold little imagined, when
under Mrs. Gerrarde's influence he obtained
his liberty, that he was be&s;towing on this
wicked wretch power to ruin him.</P>
<P>I do not imagine Mrs. Gerrarde was in
this &s;ecret. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would not know|ingly
have contributed to beggar the man by
whom &s;he was &s;upported in affluence. But
be that as it will, the evidence of this fellow,
who was bred an attorney, together with
that of Mrs. Arnold's maid, e&s;tabli&s;hed the
proof on which the i&s;&s;ue of the whole affair
turned.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for us, we could find no|body
capable of giving any te&s;timony which
could overthrow theirs: and the irregularity
of the late Mr. Arnold's life gave the&s;e evi|dences
an appearance at lea&s;t of truth. God
forgive tho&s;e people the foul play they made
u&s;e of! I would not po&s;&s;e&s;s a king's revenue
on the terms they now enjoy the Arnold
e&s;tate. 'Tis whi&s;pered, that the widow is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be privately married to this at|torney;
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&s;he owes him a recompence; for I
fear he has ri&s;qued a great deal to &s;erve her.
The wretch had the effrontery to acknowledge
his obligation to Mr. Arnold; and at the
&s;ame time declared, that nothing but the
ju&s;tice which he owed the widow, and the
orphan of his late friend, could have extort|ed
a te&s;timony from him to his prejudice.</P>
<P>I need not tell you in what light my poor
Mr. Arnold looks upon this affair. He &s;aid
to a gentleman, from whom Sir George had
the account, that he was ju&s;tlypuni&s;hed for
having furni&s;hed &s;uch a villain with the means
of undoing him, and execrates the memory
of Mrs. Gerrarde, who prevailed on him to
do it; for he &s;carce knew the fellow at that
time, having only &s;een him once or twice
at her lodgings. But let me drop the men|tion
of &s;uch wretches at once. My heart is
full of impatience to hear &s;omething from
Mr. Arnold. Mrs. Gerrarde's letter I fear
as had no effect on him; he mu&s;t have re|ceived
it long &s;ince. What can this dread|ful
&s;ilence mean? My mother now expects
the advances towards a reconciliation &s;hould
be on <HI>his</HI> &s;ide. I would I were rid of my
&s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 29.&mdash;Lord and Lady V&mdash;
arrived in town la&s;t night. They &s;ent a com|pliment
to me as &s;oon as they alighted at
their hou&s;e, which was not 'till nine o'clock;
and this morning at the &s;ame hour I was a|greeably
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;urprized by a vi&s;it from my lord:
&s;urprized, I &s;ay, for he is &s;eldom out of bed
&s;o &s;oon. I had him up to my dre&s;&s;ing-room;
my mother had never &s;een him, and as &s;he
was undre&s;&s;ed, did not chu&s;e to appear. Well,
my good lady, &s;aid he, after &s;aluting me, have
you heard any-thing from Mr. Arnold lately?
I told him I had not. I don't know whether
you are apprized, &s;aid he, that I am in all your
&s;ecrets: Mr. Faulkland and I corre&s;pond,
and I know how all matters &s;tand. You are
not made acquainted, perhaps, that I was
aiding and abetting to a certain &s;cheme. I
told him that Mr. Faulkland had writ my bro|ther
the whole account, and that I was &s;ure
of his kind participation in every thing that
related to me. That you may depend on,
&s;aid he; the thing cannot be named that I
would not do to &s;erve you. I under&s;tand
from Mr. Faulkland, that Mrs. Gerrarde has
writ to Mr. Arnold: Have you heard of no
effects produced by that letter? I told him,
I had never heard a word from Mr. Arnold
&s;ince he had received it. I hope it will not
be long before you will, an&s;wered he; I
called on you this morning on purpo&s;e to
prepare you; for I &s;u&s;pect Mr. Arnold
wants to be reconciled: he wrote to me ten
days ago, conjuring me in the &s;tronge&s;t
terms to come to town, and to prevail on
lady V&mdash;to accompany me: he &s;aid he
had &s;omething of the utmo&s;t: con&s;equence to
<PB N="24" REF="25">
con&s;ult us upon, in which our friend&s;hip
might be of mo&s;t material &s;ervice to him:
he concluded with telling me, that the whole
happine&s;s of his life depended on our com|plying
with his reque&s;t. Now as this was
immediately on his receiving Mrs. Gerrarde's
letter, for I had regular intelligence of the
whole proceeding, I flatter my&s;elf that it was
in con&s;equence of that letter he made this
reque&s;t, with a de&s;ign, as I hope, of get|ting
us to mediate between you. As I could
not ju&s;t then attend his &s;ummons, having
bu&s;ine&s;s at V&mdash;hall to detain me, I wrote
him word, that I &s;hould certainly be in town
as on this day; and that lady V&mdash;would be
&s;ure to accompany me. I have not heard
from him &s;ince 'till la&s;t night, when I &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age to his hou&s;e to de&s;ire his company
to breakfa&s;t with me this morning; I expect
him at ten o'clock. Now I had a mind to
inform you of this opening, which to me
&s;eems to promi&s;e very favourably for you.
I &s;hall not mention my having &s;een you, &s;o
that I can &s;ay nothing from you to him. I
a&s;ked him, was my lady acquainted with
the affair as it really &s;tood? He &s;aid &s;he was;
for that &s;he had been &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t
Mr. Faulkland on his fir&s;t going off with
Mrs. Gerrarde, whom &s;he thought he had
run away with upon a very different de|&s;ign,
that he was very glad to undeceive her,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
and that &s;he would pre&s;ently have done the
&s;ame by me, after the letter &s;he had wrote
me about that affair, but that he prevented
her, thinking Mr. Faulkland would be bet|ter
plea&s;ed to unravel the my&s;tery him&s;elf.
He added, that &s;he was too much my friend,
not to enter warmly into my intere&s;ts, and
had been extremely impatient to come to
town. I thanked my lord for his and his
lady's friend&s;hip. He then a&s;ked me how
our law-&s;uit went on? I an&s;wered, it had
been determined &s;ome days ago, and we had
lo&s;t our cau&s;e. He turned pale at the news.
Good God! what an unfortunate man your
hu&s;band is, &s;aid he! What will become of
him?</P>
<P>He put an end to his vi&s;it immediately,
telling me, that either he or his lady would
call on me in the afternoon, to let me know
the re&s;ult of their conference with Mr. Ar|nold.</P>
<P>I flew to my mother, to tell her the joy|ful
news. She offered up a prayer that it
might turn out as my lord V&mdash;had &s;ugge&s;|ted;
and &s;aid, &s;he her&s;elf was of the &s;ame
opinion.</P>
<P>With a heart elated with plea&s;ure, my
dear Cecilia, I have &s;cribbled over the occur|rences
of this morning. God grant I may
be able to clo&s;e my journal of to day with
the happy wi&s;hed-for event!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
I never counted the clock with &s;uch impa|tience
as I did this day, waiting the promi|&s;ed
vi&s;it of lord or lady V&mdash;, and I ordered
my&s;elf to be denied to all company but them.
At one o'clock good lady V&mdash;came, without
my lord. When I heard the rap at the door,
and &s;aw from the window it was her equ$|page,
I was &s;eized with &s;uch a trembling, that
when lady V&mdash;, who hurried up &s;tairs, en|tered
the room, I was unable to &s;peak, or &s;a|lute
her. She ran up to me, and taking me
by the hand, affectionately embraced me.
My mother was pre&s;ent; I made a &s;hift to
pre&s;ent her to lady V&mdash;. She then led me to
a chair, and &s;at down by me. Come, my
dear Mrs Arnold, &s;aid &s;he, recover your
&s;pirits; all will be well. I began to apologize
for giving her lady&s;hip the trouble of coming
to me, when it was my duty to have waited
on her. Do not mention ceremony, &s;aid &s;he,
I was in too much ha&s;te to bring you good
news, to think of forms. We have had Mr.
Arnold with us till within this half hour, and
indeed he more de&s;erves your pity now than
your re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Oh! I feared it, &s;aid I, and tears &s;tarted
into my eyes. If you are &s;o affected at the
barely knowing this, &s;aid my lady, I mu&s;t
not tell you the particulars of our conver&s;ati|on;
it will be enough for you to know, that
your hu&s;band is convinced of the injuries he
<PB N="27" REF="28">
has done you, and de&s;ires nothing more than
your forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Dear lady V&mdash;, &s;aid I, excu&s;e me; my
heart is really &s;o &s;oftened by &s;orrow, that I
cannot command my tears. But I beg that
may not deter you from indulging me with
the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between you
and Mr. Arnold. If I do weep, as my tears
no longer proceed from grief, do not let them
interrupt you.</P>
<P>My mother joined in begging lady V&mdash;to
inform us of all that pa&s;&s;ed in that morning's
interview.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;obligingly complied, and gave
the following account of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold came exactly at ten o'clock;
my lord was ju&s;t returned from his vi&s;it to
you, and had got in but a few minutes before
him. Poor Mr. Arnold looked aba&s;hed up|on
&s;eeing me; his countenance and his voice
di&s;covered the humiliation of his mind. Af|ter
the fir&s;t compliments were over, we &s;at
down to breakfa&s;t; your hu&s;band drank a di&s;h
of coffee, but eat nothing. We were in
ha&s;te, that the &s;ervants &s;hould leave the room,
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them as &s;oon as we could. My
lord then opened the conver&s;ation, by &s;aying,
Well, Arnold, here are lady V&mdash;and I
come to attend your &s;ummons; now tell us
what &s;ervice you have to employ us in, for I
a&s;&s;ure you, we are both ready to do you any
act of friend&s;hip in our power.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
My lord, I thank you, &s;aid Mr. Arnold;
the friend&s;hip you honour me with, I flatte|red
my&s;elf, &s;ome time ago, might have been
&s;erviceable to me; I mu&s;t not now think of
making u&s;e of it. When I reque&s;ted the fa|vour
of lady V&mdash;'s pre&s;ence and your's in
town, I meant to intreat your interpo&s;ition
between me and Mrs. Arnold I know I
have wronged her &s;o, that were &s;he any other
than the woman &s;he is, I could never hope
for forgivene&s;s; but from <HI>her</HI> I did hope it,
and thought your good offices might bring
about a reunion. But that is all over, I nei|ther
de&s;ire nor wi&s;h it now.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for that, Mr. Arnold, &s;aid I;
I am &s;ure nothing in this world be&s;ides can
ever make either your lady or you happy.</P>
<P>Do you know, madam, &s;aid he, (and the
poor man really looked wildly) that you &s;ee
an ab&s;olute beggar before you? A man with|out
a foot of land, overwhelmed with debts,
and who &s;hortly will not have a hou&s;e to &s;hel|ter
him&s;elf in. <HI>I</HI> de&s;erve it all, but Mrs.
Arnold does not. Do you think, that after
all the wrongs I have done her, I will involve
her in poverty too? No, lady V&mdash;, no. I
am not &s;uch an abandoned wretch. All I de|&s;ire
now of your lady&s;hip is, to tell my wife
that I beg her forgivene&s;s, and reque&s;t &s;he
will take care of our two children; through
the &s;canty pittance that her mother's &s;crupu|lous
nicety retained for her will hardly ena|ble
<PB N="29" REF="30">
her to do it; but while lady Bidulph lives,
I believe &s;he will not &s;ee them want.</P>
<P>He uttered all this with &s;o much eagerne&s;s,
that we never once attempted to interrupt him.</P>
<P>As I did not then know of the lo&s;s of your
cau&s;e, I was &s;urprized to hear him &s;peak of
his circum&s;tances being &s;o de&s;perate, and real|ly
feared his head was turned. But my lord
&s;oon explained the matter, by &s;aying, he had
heard that morning of the I&s;&s;ue of his law|&s;uit,
yet &s;till hoped, that matters were not &s;o
bad as he repre&s;ented them to be. He then
told Mr. Arnold, he was extremely glad to
find that his wife had recovered his good
opinion; adding, that <HI>he</HI> always had the
highe&s;t one of your virtue. It amazes me,
Mr. Arnold, &s;aid I, that you ever could en|tertain
a doubt of it. So it does <HI>me</HI> now,
madam, &s;aid Mr. Arnold; but I have been
for this year pa&s;t in a dream, a horrid deliri|um,
from which that vile &s;orcere&s;s, who
brought it on me, has but ju&s;t now rouzed me.</P>
<P>I wanted to draw Mr. Arnold to this
point. Have you heard any thing of her
&s;ince &s;he left you, Sir, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>He drew a letter out of his pocket, and
without an&s;wering me, put it into my hands,
and de&s;ired me to read it; then ro&s;e off his
chair, and walked about the room.</P>
<P>My lord and I read Mrs. Gerrarde's letter
together; we were both curious to &s;ee it,
Mr. Faukland having mentioned it in his
<PB N="30" REF="31">
corre&s;pondence. Mr. Arnold, &s;aid I, return|ing
it to him, <HI>without</HI> any &s;uch proof as this,
I believe nobody that knows your lady would
think her guilty; nor could I ever entertain
&s;o bad an opinion of Mr. Faulkland: I have
known him from his boyi&s;h days, and never
had rea&s;on to believe him capable of a di&s;ho|nourable
action.</P>
<P>I believe him innocent, as to <HI>this,</HI> an&s;we|red
Mr. Arnold, but you cannot conceive the
pains that were taken by that vile woman to
make me think otherwi&s;e; neither would her
retracting all &s;he &s;aid now work &s;o much on
me, as other corroborating circum&s;tances: her
running away with the very man, of whom
&s;he rai&s;ed my jealou&s;y, after having plunder|ed
me of almo&s;t every thing I had to be&s;tow,
does not look like a &s;udden re&s;olution: the
&s;cheme mu&s;t have been concerted for &s;ome
time, and Faulkland, I &s;uppo&s;e, was <HI>her</HI> pa|ramour,
at the very time &s;he &s;o ba&s;ely &s;lande|red
Mrs. Arnold; for I am not &s;o blind,
even to the per&s;onal charms of my wife, as
to imagine the greate&s;t incon&s;tant would grow
tired of her in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>Why, I mu&s;t own, &s;aid my lord, that is a
natural inference, which, joined to the perfi|dy
and fal&s;hood of Mrs. Gerrarde, puts it
out of di&s;pute, that &s;he traduced Mr. Faulk|land
and your wife, merely to gain her own
wicked ends; one part of which I am incli|ned
to think &s;he confe&s;&s;es in her letter; that
<PB N="31" REF="32">
is to &s;ay, to have you intirely in her own
hands, though not for the rea&s;on &s;he there
gives. Her other motive, I think, now
plainly appears by the con&s;equence: &s;he
thought, if you were jealous of your wife,
you would hardly &s;u&s;pect <HI>her</HI> with the &s;ame
per&s;on, who&s;e vi&s;its, to my knowledge, were
pretty frequent at her hou&s;e. Then, &s;aid I,
(throwing my weight into the &s;cale) the un|objectionable
character of Mrs. Arnold, her
pious education, her mode&s;t and affectionate
behaviour to you for &s;o long a time, and the
reclu&s;e life that &s;he has led with her mother
&s;ince you parted, makes the thought of any
ill in her quite incredible.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;, &s;aid your hu&s;band, impatient|ly,
I am as con&s;cious of it all as you can po&s;|&s;ibly
wi&s;h me. I know I am a blind infatua|ted
mon&s;ter: What can you &s;ay more?
Faulkland, I thank you for ridding me of
&s;uch a pe&s;t; Oh! that you had taken her be|fore
I was &s;o cur&s;t as to &s;ee her face! If you
had, I &s;hould not now be the undone wretch
I am! My lord, my lady, will you do me the
favour to tell my wife and lady Bidulph, how
contrite I am (and he laid his hand on his
brea&s;t): while I had any thing to offer her
be&s;ides repentance, I could have thrown my|&s;elf
at her feet for pardon, and conjured her
to have returned to my bo&s;om, and to her
own de&s;erted hou&s;e, from whence my mad|ne&s;s
drove her; but I have now no hou&s;e to
<PB N="32" REF="33">
bring her to, and do not de&s;ire even to &s;ee
her face.</P>
<P>His manner was &s;o vehement, that I really
feared the agitations of his mind might di&s;or|der
his brain. My lord told him he was too
de&s;ponding, and &s;aid, he hoped all might be
yet retrieved. He then enquired into the par|ticular
&s;ituation of his affairs, which are, I am
grieved to &s;ay it, very bad indeed. We were
told, when we were in Kent, that a part of
South-Park was mortgaged, but did not be|lieve
it, as we knew it was &s;ettled on you.
Upon being a&s;ked, Mr. Arnold him&s;elf ac|knowledged
it, confe&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time,
that he had been prevailed on to do this, in
order to deliver Mrs. Gerrarde's brother out
of goal, and that it was the other villainous
brother who had tran&s;acted the affair for him.
I find, be&s;ides this mortgage, that, with the
co&s;ts of his &s;uit, he owes near &s;even thou&s;and
pounds; to an&s;wer which, he &s;ays, he is not
worth &s;ix-pence, his plate and the furniture
of his hou&s;es in town and country excepted.</P>
<P>Though I have &s;hed many tears, whil&s;t La|dy
V&mdash;was de&s;cribing Mr. Arnold's behavi|our
at the beginning of her di&s;cour&s;e, I heard
this latter part of her account with a compo|&s;ed
attention.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;took me by the hand: I am
&s;orry, dear Mrs. Arnold, &s;aid &s;he, that I am
obliged to repeat &s;uch uncomfortable tidings
to you, but you mu&s;t know all, &s;oon or late,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
and it as well now as hereafter. I am &s;ure
your patient temper and good &s;en&s;e will ena|ble
you to bear up again&s;t misfortunes.</P>
<P>My lord then proceeded to a&s;k Mr. Arnold,
if his friends could make his circum&s;tances a
little ea&s;ier, and Mrs. Arnold would con&s;ent
to live with him again, had he any objection
to it?</P>
<P>My lord, an&s;wered your hu&s;band, from the
moment I heard of Mrs. Gerrarde's elope|ment,
I flattered my&s;elf with the hopes of be|ing
re&s;tored to my &s;en&s;es, and my peace, by
a reunion with my wife; for I own to you,
her innocence from that very time became e|vident
to me, and it was mere &s;hame that
prevented me from making my application to
lady Bidulph, for the purpo&s;e of a reconcili|ation.
The receipt of Mrs. Gerrarde's letter
&mdash;(whether the wretch has <HI>really</HI> felt com|punction,
or whether her cruelty to me, in
order to make me more unhappy, has drawn
it from her I know not) the receipt of that let|ter,
I &s;ay, wherein Mrs. Arnold s innocence
is &s;o entirely cleared, convinced me, I ought
not to delay making my wife all the repara|tion
in my power. Though I was &s;hocked to
think how much I had fooli&s;hly &s;quandered
away, I was &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate of
nine hundred pounds a year; for though it
was then in ligitation, my lawyers amu&s;ed me
to the la&s;t, with a belief that I &s;hould carry
my &s;uit; and notwith&s;tanding that the pay|ment
<PB N="34" REF="35">
of my debts would le&s;&s;en it, I knew,
with one of her contented and gentle &s;pirit, it
would be &s;ufficient to make us happy, and her
jointure (which I hoped &s;oon to clear) added
to it, would enable us to fit down in the coun|try
in tolerable affluence, and I had come to
a re&s;olution to make it the &s;tudy of my life
to render Mrs. Arnold happy. I knew &s;he
is an admirable oeconomi&s;t; I re&s;olved to imi|tate
her, and I hoped in time to retrieve our
circum&s;tances. The&s;e were my &s;entiments,
my lord, when I wrote to you, to beg that
you and my lady would come to town. I own
I had not courage enough to make any efforts
towards the &s;o much wi&s;hed-for reunion, with|out
the interpo&s;ition of friends, who&s;e good
hearts I knew would rejoice, could their endea|vours
bring it about, and who&s;e influence over
Mrs. Arnold I was certain would make the
accompli&s;hment ea&s;y. Do me the ju&s;tice my
lord, to believe, that if I had not thought it
in my power, to have made Mrs Arnold a|mends
for the injuries I have done her, this
hand &s;hould have been &s;ooner employed to
&s;end a pi&s;tol bullet thro' my head, than to
have endeavoured to procure your mediation
in the affair.</P>
<P>But as things have turned out, I would not
for this earthly globe involve her in my ruin;
nor &s;hall her family have it to &s;ay, I &s;ought
their friend&s;hip when I was abandoned of eve|ry
other hope.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
As to that point, an&s;wered my lord, I can
bear you witne&s;s, that your fir&s;t overture to
me, in order to bring about a reconciliation,
arrived before there was any likelihood of
your &s;tanding in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either from
your wife's friends or your own; for I believe
they all, as well as your&s;elf, were pretty &s;ure
of your carrying your &s;uit, which, if you had
done, your affairs might, with a little care,
have &s;oon been, in a great mea&s;ure, retriev|ed.
Therefore, if they &s;hould attempt to
make the ungenerous charge you apprehend,
I can confute it, and will to all the world;
and for the re&s;t, we mu&s;t manage as well as
we can.</P>
<P>My lord then propo&s;ed &s;ome methods to
make his affairs a little more ea&s;y; as I am
&s;ure his friend&s;hip for Mr. Arnold and you
will make him endeavour to &s;ettle them to the
be&s;t of his power.</P>
<P>My lady V&mdash;'s politene&s;s and genero&s;ity
would not &s;uffer her to mention the particu|lars
of the methods propo&s;ed; but I have rea|&s;on
to believe, my good lord V&mdash;will intere&s;t
him&s;elf rather farther than I wi&s;h.</P>
<P>When my lord and Mr. Arnold, &s;he pro|ceeded,
had talked over the&s;e matters for &s;ome
time, in which my lord had much ado to get
the better of Mr. Arnold's ob&s;tinacy, he told
him, that I &s;hould undertake to explain his
&s;ituation to you and lady Bidulph. That he
made no doubt of your tenderne&s;s in forget|ting
<PB N="36" REF="37">
all that was pa&s;t, and being willing to
embrace his fortunes, let them be what they
would; for, &s;aid he, I am &s;ure Mrs. Arnold
will think her&s;elf happier with you, on three
hundred pounds a year, than &s;he would with
twice &s;o many thou&s;ands without you.</P>
<P>Oh! madam, &s;aid I, interrupting her, my
lord has read my very heart.</P>
<P>My lady &s;miled and went on. Lady Bi|dulph,
&s;aid my lord, is &s;o good a woman,
that as &s;he mu&s;t look on you in the light of
a repenting &s;inner, you may be a&s;&s;ured of her
pardon and favour. That he may re&s;t &s;a|tisfied
of, an&s;wering my mother. My in|come
is not con&s;iderable, and I have never
been able to lay any thing by; but if Mr.
Arnold can be extricated from his pre&s;ent
difficulties, &s;o as to be able to retire quietly
into the country, I will &s;hare that little with
him.</P>
<P>My lady V&mdash;'s Eyes moi&s;tened, mine
were quite &s;uffu&s;ed. I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid lady
V&mdash;, it was not without abundance of ar|guments
u&s;ed by my lord, and downright
quarrelling on my &s;ide, that Mr. Arnold
could be prevailed on to con&s;ent that any
other application &s;hould be made on his part,
than that of acquainting you with his pen$|tence,
and communicating his re&s;olution, to|gether
with his motives for it, of never &s;eeing
you more.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
He &s;ays, Sir George Bidulph never was
his friend; and, as he &s;uppo&s;es him more
now his enemy than ever, he would be &s;orry
to be under any obligations to him.</P>
<P>My mother who never conceals her
thoughts, an&s;wered directly, of that I be|lieve
he need not be apprehen&s;ive; Sir
George is not very liberal; he would have
per&s;uaded his &s;i&s;ter again&s;t returning to her
hu&s;band, and I am &s;ure will not be willing to
contribute towards making their reunion
happy. Be&s;ides, as he is now going to be
married, he troubles him&s;elf with little el&s;e
than his intended bride.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;&s;eemed &s;hocked; I was &s;orry
my mother had &s;poke &s;o freely of Sir George,
to one who was an entire &s;tranger both to
him and her; but &s;he is &s;o good, that even
her errors proceed from virtue.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid lady V&mdash;, we have now &s;een
the wor&s;t &s;ide of the pro&s;pect; let us turn
our eyes towards the plea&s;anter view. What
do you mean to do, Mrs. Arnold?</P>
<P>Mean, madam, &s;aid I! To go directly to
my Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Well, well, replied &s;he, &s;miling, <HI>that</HI> I
&s;uppo&s;e; but how do you purpo&s;e to &s;ettle
your little hou&s;hold matters?</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid my mother, the be&s;t thing you
can do, is, to go directly down to my hou&s;e
in Wilt&s;hire. You know <HI>that,</HI> and the furni|ture
are mine, during my life; they go to your
<PB N="38" REF="39">
brother afterwards. Send for your two chil|dren
and hone&s;t Martha; di&s;po&s;e of your
hou&s;e in town, and all your effects here, as
well as at South-park and in E&s;&s;ex&mdash;let
the produce be applied to the payment of
debts, as far as it will go. You will then
have your jointure to receive, to which I will
add two hundred pounds a year, which will
enable you, by degrees, to pay off the re&s;t of
your debts, and I do not &s;ee why you may
not live comfortably be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Extremely well, &s;aid my lady, with Mrs.
Arnold's good management; e&s;pecially as
they will not have the expence of hou&s;e-rent.
I am &s;ure my lord will willingly undertake
to manage Mr. Arnold's affairs in town for
him, and I would have you both get into
the country as fa&s;t as you can.</P>
<P>I am entirely of your opinion lady V&mdash;,
&s;aid my mother, What do you think, child?
Dear madam, I think that I am the hap|pie&s;t
woman breathing. Such a parent as
you, &s;uch a friend as lady V&mdash;, and &s;uch a
hu&s;band, as I promi&s;e my&s;elf Mr. Arnold
will prove&mdash;How can I be otherwi&s;e than
happy? I am ready to do, to do joyfully,
whatever you direct. Dear lady V&mdash;, ought
not I to &s;ee poor Mr. Arnold immedi|ately?</P>
<P>Why, &s;aid lady V&mdash;, I would not have
you &s;urprize him; he is to dine with us
to-day, and I will prepare him to receive
<PB N="39" REF="40">
you in the afternoon at my hou&s;e, if you
chu&s;e it.</P>
<P>By all means, my good lady V&mdash;, I will
come to your hou&s;e at five o' clock. Well,
&s;aid &s;he, bring a few &s;pirits with you, and
do not let the interview &s;often you too
much.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;then took her leave, as &s;he &s;aid
&s;he &s;hould hardly have time to dre&s;s before
dinner. My mother and I &s;pent the inter|val
between that time and evening, in talk|ing
of our future &s;cheme of life. Remem|ber,
my dear, &s;aid &s;he, that when I die, you
lo&s;e the be&s;t part of your income, as my
hou&s;e, together with my jointure, revert to
Sir George; and you have no great rea&s;on
to expect that he will continue either to you;
it therefore behoves you to u&s;e oeconomy,
as well for the &s;ake of <HI>&s;aving</HI> a little, as to
accu&s;tom your&s;elves to <HI>live</HI> upon a little.
I would my&s;elf accompany you down to
the country, but as my &s;on's marriage is &s;o
near, he would have rea&s;on to take it ami&s;s
of me; and I know I &s;hall have his imperi|ous
temper to battle with, on our making up
matters between you and your hu&s;band;
but I &s;hall make my&s;elf ea&s;y, by reflecting
that we have both acted agreeably to our
duty.</P>
<P>You never, my Cecilia, experienced &s;uch
a &s;ituation as mine, and therefore can have
no idea of what I felt, in expectation of &s;ee|ing
<PB N="40" REF="41">
the per&s;on, who&s;e pre&s;ence I mo&s;t ar|dently
wi&s;hed for, and yet was afraid of the
interview. My fears were not on my own
account: con&s;cious as I was of my innocence,
I had no apprehen&s;ions on that head: but I
could not bear the thoughts of beholding
poor Mr. Arnold, in the &s;tate of humiliation
in which I &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould find him. I
wi&s;hed the fir&s;t encounter of our eyes over;
and as the appointed hour approached, my
anxiety encrea&s;ed: I was faint, and &s;eized
with univer&s;al tremors My mother did all
&s;he could to encourage me, and a little be|fore
five o'clock, I was put into a chair, and
carried to lord V&mdash;'s hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My lady met me on the &s;tairs; I could
&s;carce breathe. She carried me into her
dre&s;&s;ing-room, and made me &s;it down till I
recovered a little; &s;he was affected her&s;elf,
but endeavoured to rai&s;e my &s;pirits. I wi&s;h,
&s;aid &s;he, &s;miling you had been in my lord's
hands, he would have prepared you better
than lady Bidulph has for this meeting; he
has been trying to make Mr. Arnold drunk,
in order to give him courage, he &s;ays, to face
you. Poor man, he could &s;carcely credit me
when I told him you were to come this even|ing
She propo&s;ed my taking a few drops,
which I agreed to; and bidding me pluck
up my &s;pirit, &s;aid &s;he would &s;end Mr. Ar|nold
to me.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
I catched lady V&mdash;by the hand, and beg|ged
&s;he would de&s;ire him, from me, not to
mention any thing that was pa&s;t, but let our
meeting be, as if the &s;eparation had only been
occa&s;ioned by a long journey.</P>
<P>She left me, and Mr. Arnold in a few
minutes entered the room. He approached
me &s;peechle&s;s; my arms were extended to
receive him; he fell into them; we neither
of us &s;poke; there was no language but
tears, which we both &s;hed plentifully. Mr.
Arnold &s;obbed as I pre&s;&s;ed him to my bo&s;om.
My deare&s;t Sidney, &s;aid he, can it be! Is it
po&s;&s;ible that you love me &s;till?</P>
<P>If lady V&mdash;delivered my me&s;&s;age to you,
my dear Mr. Arnold, &s;ure you would not
&s;peak thus to me.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, &s;aid he; Oh! my dear:
I never wi&s;hed for wealth or length of days,
till now&mdash;but what I can I. will.</P>
<P>Forbear, my love, &s;aid I; remember my
reque&s;t. I wanted to give his thoughts ano|ther
turn. My mother longs to &s;ee you:
When will you vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>I will throw my&s;elf at her feet, &s;aid he; I
want a ble&s;&s;ing from her, and &s;he has &s;ent
me one, throwing his arms again round
me.</P>
<P>How much are we obliged to good lord
and lady V&mdash;, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Oh! they have opened to me the path to
Heaven, he an&s;wered&mdash;if it had not been for
<PB N="42" REF="43">
them&mdash;I think we had better go to them,
&s;aid I, they will partake in our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He took me by the hand without an|&s;wering,
and led me into the drawing|room.</P>
<P>I have, my &s;i&s;ter, endeavoured to recol|lect
our disjointed conver&s;ation, in order to
give it to you as well as I could. All that I
can remember I have &s;et down, though I am
&s;ure a good deal more pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;'s eyes &s;parkled when he &s;aw us
enter together; but my lady and he, I &s;up|po&s;e,
had agreed before-hand to &s;ay nothing
that could recall any pa&s;t griefs, for they on|ly
&s;miled at our entrance; and my lord &s;aid,
Arnold, you really hand your lady in with as
gallant an air, as if you were married with|in
the&s;e three hours. And &s;o I have been,
my lord, an&s;wered Mr. Arnold. My lady
pre&s;ently called for tea, and we chatted as if
nothing had happened. The &s;ervants wait|ing
in the room made this nece&s;&s;ary; though
I could ob&s;erve the two footmen, who had
lived a good while with lord V&mdash;, looked
with no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment at Mr. Arnold and
me.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants were withdrawn, my
lady introduced the &s;ubject of our going out
of town. She had before acquainted him
with my mother's propo&s;al, and I repeated
what &s;he had &s;aid to me on that head, after
ady V&mdash;had left us. My lord renew|ed
<PB N="43" REF="44">
the kind offers of his friend&s;hip, and &s;aid,
as we meant &s;o &s;hortly to part with our hou&s;e
in St. James's &s;treet, that he thought it would
be better for us not to go into it at all, but
make u&s;e of his hou&s;e while we &s;taid in
town; as perhaps Mr. Arnold might not like
to be at lady Bidulph's, on account of Sir
George's coming there.</P>
<P>I readily a&s;&s;ented to this propo&s;al; and
Mr. Arnold &s;aid it would be mo&s;t agreeable
to him. I told him, however, I &s;hould be
glad of my mother's approbation; and a&s;k|ed
Mr. Arnold if he did not think it would
be right of us both to wait on her together,
to let her know of my lord's kind invitation.
My lady V&mdash;&s;aid, by all means, and the
&s;ooner the better: if you plea&s;e, I will order
the chariot; I would have you &s;ee lady Bi|dulph
directly. Mr. Arnold &s;aid, it was
what he purpo&s;ed doing that very night.</P>
<P>The chariot was pre&s;ently at the door: la|dy
V&mdash;&s;aid, I have an apartment rea|dy,
and &s;hall, with lady Bidulph's permi&s;&s;i|on,
expect you back to-night. We promi&s;ed
to return, and drove to my mother's.</P>
<P>I left Mr. Arnold in the parlour, whil&s;t I
ran up &s;tairs to inform her of his being come
to wait on her.</P>
<P>Unluckily, as well as unexpectedly, I found
my brother with her. I judged by his voice,
as I came up &s;tairs, that he was talking
warmly to my mother; he &s;topped, however,
<PB N="44" REF="45">
when I came into the room. He was &s;tand|ing,
and had his hat under his arm. I con|cluded
he was going, and was not &s;orry for
it; he ca&s;t a cold look at me, and, with an
ironical &s;mile, I wi&s;h you joy Mrs. <HI>Arnold,</HI> and
he pronounced my name with an empha&s;is.
Tho' I was &s;tung at his manner, I would not
let him &s;ee it. Thank you brother, &s;aid I,
God be prai&s;ed I <HI>have</HI> cau&s;e to rejoice. Oh!
no doubt on't, &s;aid he, &s;o have we all, that
your hu&s;band has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, af|ter
beggaring you and your children, turning
you out of doors, and branding you with
infamy, to receive you at la&s;t into his fa|vour.</P>
<P>Sir George, &s;aid I, you &s;hock me exceed|ingly:
where is the need of tho&s;e cruel re|petitions?
Indeed you are very unkind; and
I could not refrain from tears.</P>
<P>The more blameable Mr. Arnold's con|duct
has been, &s;aid my mother, the more
cau&s;e have we to rejoice in his amendment.
We mu&s;t make allowances for human fail|ings.</P>
<P>Ay, madam, I wi&s;h you had thought of
that in Mr. <HI>Faulkland</HI>'s ca&s;e, cried my bro|ther.</P>
<P>My mother &s;eemed di&s;contented at the re|buke.
Sir George looked and &s;miled, with
an air of ill-natured triumph. As my mo|ther
was not quick in an&s;wering, I replied,
the ca&s;es are very different, brother; what
<PB N="45" REF="46">
duty obliges us to pa&s;s by in a hu&s;band, it is
hardly moral not to di&s;countenance in another
man.</P>
<P>You &s;ay true, child, &s;aid my mother; a
woman certainly ought not to marry a loo&s;e
man, if &s;he knows him to be &s;uch; but if it
be her misfortune to be joined to &s;uch a one,
&s;he is not to reject him, but more e&s;pecially
if &s;he &s;ees him willing to reform. Where is
your hu&s;band my dear? Madam, he is be|low
in the parlour: he is come to receive
your forgivene&s;s, and your ble&s;&s;ing. He &s;hall
have both, &s;aid my good mother, and my
prayers too. Sir George looked a little &s;ur|prized:
I will not interrupt &s;o <HI>pious</HI> a cere|mony,
&s;aid he, but I hope you will give me
leave to withdraw before you de&s;ire him up
&s;tairs; &s;aying this, he bowed &s;lightly to my
mother, and left the room: we neither of
us &s;aid any thing to &s;top him; my mother
rang the bell, but before a &s;ervant could at|tend,
he went out, and clapped the door vio|lently
after him.</P>
<P>Go bring your hu&s;band up to me, &s;aid my
mother. I begged &s;he would not mention
any thing of Sir George's behaviour. I found
Mr. Arnold impatient at my &s;tay. Poor man,
his &s;ituation made him jealous of every thing
that looked like a &s;light. I told him, my
brother had been above &s;tairs, and as I did
not think a meeting would at that time have
been agreeable to either of them, I waited
till he was gone. I perceive he knew <HI>I</HI> was
<PB N="46" REF="47">
in the hou&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Arnold, by the blu&s;|tering
manner of his departure. I made no
reply; but taking him under the arm, led
him to my mother.</P>
<P>That be&s;t of women received him with a
tenderne&s;s that delighted me; he put one
knee to the ground while &s;he embraced him
with maternal love, then rai&s;ed him, and ta|king
his hand and mine, joined them, hold|ing
them between her own. God ble&s;s you
my children, &s;aid &s;he, and may you never
more be &s;eparated, till God, who joined you,
calls one or other of you to him&s;elf. Amen,
cried I fervently. Amen, repeated Mr. Ar|nold.</P>
<P>He then be&s;ought my mother to forgive
him for all the affliction he had occa&s;ioned
both to her and me; a&s;&s;uring her that his
veneration for her, and his tenderne&s;s for me,
were augmented a hundred - fold, and
&s;hould for the future influence his whole con|duct.</P>
<P>After this, we fell on the &s;ubject of our do|me&s;tick
affairs: we informed my mother of
my lord V&mdash;'s propo&s;al, and &s;aid, as we
&s;hould &s;tay in town but two or thee days, we
had accepted of the offer of being at his hou&s;e,
rather than by our pre&s;ence bani&s;h my bro|ther
from her's.</P>
<P>He is an untractable man, &s;aid &s;he; but
as I do not wi&s;h to quarrel with my children,
I think it will be prudent for you to &s;tay at my
<PB N="47" REF="48">
lord's rather than here. Mr. Arnold &s;aid his
obligations to lord V&mdash;were un&s;peakable;
for that he had promi&s;ed not only to &s;ee all
our affairs properly &s;ettled, but to take the
mortgage of South-Park into his own hands,
as he fears the per&s;on who now has it will not
be &s;o tender a creditor as him&s;elf. He al&s;o
propo&s;es (as the &s;ale of my effects cannot a|mount
to what my debts come to) to pay
what may be deficient, and make him&s;elf
my &s;ole creditor. If it had not been for &s;uch
a pro&s;pect as this, added my dear Mr.
Arnold, notwith&s;tanding your goodne&s;s
and lady Bidulph's, I had re&s;olved never to
have appeared before either of you.</P>
<P>We determined to &s;et out for Sidney|Ca&s;tle
in three or four days at farthe&s;t;
and took leave of my mother for this
night.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 21.&mdash;I told lady V&mdash;this
morning, that though I was determined ne|ver
to mention our pa&s;t misfortune to Mr.
Arnold, yet I owned I had a great curio&s;ity
to know what means Mrs. Gerrarde had
made u&s;e of, to work up his &s;u&s;picions to
the high pitch &s;he had done; but I would ra|ther
remain un&s;atisfied, than mortify him by
the recollection of this particular.</P>
<P>I can inform you of her whole proceed|ings,
an&s;wered lady V&mdash;, as I had it from
Mr. Arnold him&s;elf; for to tell you the truth,
I was as curious about that as you, and took
<PB N="48" REF="49">
the liberty to a&s;k your hu&s;band concerning
it ye&s;terday, when we had him to our&s;elves.
It was the interval between dinner, and the
hour that you were expected here in the even|ing,
that I laid hold of for this purpo&s;e, as I
found him then compo&s;ed enough to bear the
enquiry.</P>
<P>He told me, that from the time of his go|ing
down to South-Park, Mrs. Gerrarde
had begun to throw out in&s;inuations concern|ing
you, that had a little alarmed him. She
a&s;ked him, Whether you made a good wife?
which he an&s;wering in the affirmative, &s;he re|plied,
&s;he was glad of it; for that &s;he had
been told your affections were formerly deep|ly
engaged to a very fine young gentle|man,
who, as his fortune was very much
above your expectations, your mother, fear|ing
your violent fondne&s;s for him might lead
you into &s;ome act of indi&s;cretion, had carried
you out of town on purpo&s;e to avoid him;
and was glad to marry you as ha&s;tily as
&s;he could, to put you out of the reach of
harm.</P>
<P>Your hu&s;band acknowledges, that he be|lieves
he had him&s;elf ca&s;ually informed Mrs.
Gerrarde of the manner of his fir&s;t becom|ing
acquainted with you, and the &s;uddenne&s;s
with which his marriage was concluded; yet
&s;he pretended to him, &s;he was before ap|prized
of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
He owns that tho&s;e hints, though far from
giving him any &s;u&s;picion of your virtue, had
neverthele&s;s made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on him.
You know, Madam, added he, that, madly
devoted as my affections were to Mrs. Ger|rarde,
I had always behaved to my wife
with great tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect. This I
&s;uppo&s;e it was which rai&s;ed Mrs. Gerrarde's
jealou&s;ly, and made her leave no method un|attempted
to part us. Mr. Faulkland had
not been long at V&mdash;hall, when &s;he a&s;ked
me, with uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s, whether he
vi&s;ited at my hou&s;e; I told her he did not,
and a&s;ked the meaning of her enquiry. She
affected to turn it off, and &s;aid, &s;he had no
particular rea&s;on for her que&s;tion; but her
manner was &s;uch, as the more excited my
curio&s;ity. At length &s;he was prevailed on to
tell me, that Mr. Faulkland was the man
(for &s;he had not before named the per&s;on),
whom my wife had &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loved. Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
as I was with jealou&s;y, I now took
the alarm. I recollected that Mrs. Arnold
had told me at lord V&mdash;'s, upon my fir&s;t
&s;eeing him there, that &s;he <HI>had</HI> been very well
acquainted with him; and I even thought
that I had ob&s;erved &s;omething particular in
his countenance when he addre&s;&s;ed her. I
was now &s;ure that he had come into the
neighbourhood merely on her account. The
hell that I &s;uffered is not to be de&s;cribed; for
though I really fancied that I had conceived
<PB N="50" REF="51">
almo&s;t an aver&s;ion to Mrs. Arnold, I yet
could not bear the thoughts of being di&s;ho|noured.
An accident happened which &s;erved
to &s;trengthen my &s;u&s;picions: he then related
the&punc; circum&s;tance of his &s;eeing you at the
public hou&s;e on the night of the fire; and of
his finding Mr. Faulkland putting you into
your chariot. He owned at the &s;ame time,
that he was there with Mrs. Gerrarde, whom
he had conducted out of the play-hou&s;e, hav|ing
called for her there in his return from
making a vi&s;it, as he had promi&s;ed to &s;up
with her that night. Mrs. Gerrarde, when
&s;he had him at her hou&s;e, affected to &s;peak
with &s;ome &s;urprize of your imprudence, in
&s;uffering a young man of Mr. Falkland's
<HI>known</HI> turn for gallantry, to attend you to
<HI>&s;uch</HI> a place, and at that hour. Though,
added he, Mrs. Arnold's own account of this
had &s;atisfied me at the time, yet Mrs. Ger|rarde's
in&s;inuations blew up the fire anew in
my brea&s;t. She pretended to &s;ooth me; but
the methods &s;he took rather increa&s;ed my
unea&s;ine&s;s. She told me, &s;he believed my
honour as <HI>yet</HI> had received no injury; and to
pre&s;erve it effectually, &s;he thought I could
not do better than to forbid my wife to &s;ee
Mr. Faulkland. The de&s;igning vile woman,
continued your hu&s;band, knowing that this
prohibition would cut off her vi&s;its at
V&mdash;hall, no doubt apprehended my wife
would not &s;o readily acquie&s;ce under it; and
<PB N="51" REF="52">
&s;he was &s;ure any re&s;i&s;tance on her part would
but the more inflame me. But in this &s;he
was di&s;appointed; for I no &s;ooner required
Mrs. Arnold's promi&s;e on the occa&s;ion, than
&s;he, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, made it.
My requiring &s;o extraordinary a proof of her
obedience, induced Mrs. Arnold to enquire
into the cau&s;e, and upon my explaining it,
&s;he acknowleged that Mr. Faulkland had
once been her lover, and that the match was
broken off by her mother, who had conceiv|ed
&s;ome di&s;like to him. This was &s;o far
from gaining credit with me, that it only
&s;erved to corroborate what Mrs. Gerrarde
had told me. I was, however, contented for
the pre&s;ent with the promi&s;e that my wife
had made me; of which I informed Mrs.
Gerrarde.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell me of his find|ing
you and Mr. Faulkland together one
evening at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Gerrarde. I
mu&s;t confefs, continued he, this unexpected
incident tran&s;ported me beyond the bounds
of patience: I &s;uffered, notwith&s;tanding, Mr.
Faulkland to go quietly out of the hou&s;e,
more for Mrs. Gerrarde's &s;ake than any other
con&s;ideration, and permitted her to go home
with my wife (who I then thought <HI>pretended</HI>
illne&s;s), waiting in the mean time at her hou&s;e
for her return, in order to have this extraor|dinary
and unexpected meeting explained.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">
Mrs. Gerrarde, on her return expre&s;&s;ed the
utmo&s;t concern and re&s;entment on the occa&s;i|on.
She told me, that as &s;he had expected me
that evening (which was really the ca&s;e), &s;he
had &s;ent to my wife to engage her for the
next day, in order to prevent her coming to
interrupt us, which was not unlikely, as Mrs.
Arnold had not been to &s;ee her from the time
&s;he was laid up by the hurt &s;he received;
and &s;he &s;aid, &s;he did not care to lay her&s;elf
&s;o open to her &s;ervants, as to have her&s;elf
denied to the wife, whil&s;t &s;he entertained the
hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf, continued he, having the &s;ame
apprehen&s;ions, had a&s;ked Mrs. Arnold, on
my going abroad in the morning, how &s;he
purpo&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf for the day;
and &s;he had told me &s;he intended to &s;tay at
home. Mrs. Gerrarde &s;aid, that notwith|&s;tanding
her me&s;&s;age, &s;he was &s;urprized with
a vi&s;it from Mrs. Arnold ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;it|ting
down to dinner; that &s;he however put a
good face on the matter, and received her
very cordially; but in order to get rid of her
&s;oon, told her, &s;he was engaged abroad in
the afternoon. Mrs. Arnold, &s;he added,
however thought proper to &s;tay, and I could
not avoid a&s;king her to drink coffee. While
we were at it, behold, to my very great
&s;urprize, Mr. Faulkland &s;ent in his name,
and immediately entered the parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">
As I gue&s;&s;ed, continued Mrs. Gerrarde,
that this was a &s;ettled a&s;&s;ignation, I own I
was extremely provoked at it. Mr. Faulk|land,
with whom I formerly had a very &s;light
acquaintance at Bath, <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;light indeed as ne|ver
to be vi&s;ited by him, now very audaci|ou&s;ly
made an apology for not having waited
on me &s;ooner; but &s;aid, that he did not hear
of my being in the neighbourhood, 'till a day
or two before, and hoped I would allow him
the honour of renewing his acquaintance. I
had hardly temper enough to make him a
civil an&s;wer; but &s;aid, I was &s;orry I was en|gaged
that evening, and mu&s;t be obliged to
go out immediately. I thought this hint was
enough for Mrs. Arnold; and that &s;he would
have had the di&s;cretion to have taken her
leave. She a&s;ked pardon for having kept
me at home &s;o long, prote&s;ting &s;he had really
forgot that I told her I was engaged. She
begged &s;he might not detain me any longer,
&s;aying, &s;he had ordered her chariot to come
for her in the evening, and that &s;he would
wait for it, as &s;he found her&s;elf not very well,
and therefore not able to walk home. I now
&s;aw into the whole &s;cheme: Mr. Faulkland
would naturally &s;tay to keep her company,
and they would have my hou&s;e to them&s;elves;
but I re&s;olved to di&s;appoint them both; and
telling Mrs. Arnold I would leave her at
home, ordered the chariot to the door. Mrs.
Arnold oppo&s;ed this, under pretence of not
<PB N="54" REF="55">
giving me &s;o much trouble, and pretending
to be &s;ick and faint, &s;aid, &s;he would &s;tep to
the door, in order to get a little more air; I
followed her ha&s;tily, and your coming in the
in&s;tant, I &s;uppo&s;e, detained Mr. Faulkland in
the parlour, for he could not but &s;ee you
from the window. You know the re&s;t, added
Mrs. Gerrarde; and I leave you to judge,
whether Mrs. Arnold be inclined to keep her
word with you, in regard to Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Can you blame me, Madam, proceeded
your hu&s;band, if, after what I now &s;aw and
heard, I was enraged almo&s;t to madne&s;s
again&s;t my wife? The ba&s;e woman, who had
now accompli&s;hed her wicked purpo&s;e, en|couraged
me in my de&s;peration. In the mid&s;t of
my fury, however, I could not help making
one ob&s;ervation, which was, that as Mrs.
Gerrarde's going, or pretending to go out
that evening, was a ca&s;ual thing, they could
hardly have expected an opportunity of being
<HI>alone</HI> at her hou&s;e, even though the meeting
was concerted. Mrs. Gerrarde an&s;wered,
That was very true; and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed there
was nothing at fir&s;t farther intended, than
that the <HI>lovers</HI> &s;hould have the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing and conver&s;ing together, as they had
been &s;o long &s;eparated; the other, to be &s;ure,
&s;aid &s;he, was an after-thought, which the
opportunity &s;ugge&s;ted. She then, after mak|ing
me &s;wear &s;ecrecy, told me, that Mrs.
Arnold had, when &s;he followed her out to
<PB N="55" REF="56">
the door, conjured her not to tell me that
Mr. Faulkland and &s;he (Mrs. Gerrarde) were
acquainted; for, &s;aid &s;he, as Mr. Arnold is
of a jealous temper, and has heard that Mr.
Faulkland formerly courted me, he would not
&s;uffer me to come near your hou&s;e, if he
knew that Mr. Faulkland vi&s;ited you. I pro|mi&s;ed
her I would not, added Mrs. Gerrarde;
and I make no doubt but that &s;he hoped in
time (relying on my good nature, my &s;eem|ing
fondne&s;s for her, and the ea&s;ine&s;s of my
temper) to engage me as the confidant and
abetter of her loo&s;e amour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gerrarde concluded with &s;aying, that
&s;he believed nothing criminal had as <HI>yet</HI> pa&s;|&s;ed
between Mr. Faulkland and my Wife, at
lea&s;t &s;ince his coming to V&mdash;hall; but as
there was no with holding a woman from her
will, it was very probable that Mrs. Arnold
would contrive the means of meeting, though
not at <HI>her</HI> hou&s;e, yet &s;omewhere el&s;e, I
raved, threatened, talked of fighting Faulk|land,
and locking up my wife. She artfully
di&s;&s;uaded me from &s;uch violent mea&s;ures by
a number of arguments, which I will not
trouble you with repeating: Among&s;t other
things, &s;he &s;aid, that I had no right to call
Faulkland to an account merely from &s;urmi&s;e,
which was all I had to ground my charge on;
and though there was the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to
believe he had di&s;honourable de&s;igns on Mrs.
Arnold, yet as I could not directly accu&s;e him
<PB N="56" REF="57">
of them, I &s;hould be laughed at for engaging
in a quarrel, which to the world would ap|pear
to be &s;o ill-grounded. As to what I threa|tened
in regard to my wife, &s;he &s;aid, &s;uch
mea&s;ures only make a woman de&s;perate, and
would be far from preventing the evil; in
&s;hort, that it would be better to part quietly,
without embroiling my&s;elf with her friends,
or undertaking the hateful office of becoming
g$aler to my wife. She found me but too
well di&s;po&s;ed to follow her fatal council. I
wrote that cruel letter to my wife, which
turned her from her home, at Mrs. Gerrarde's
hou&s;e. She kept me with her till midnight;
and had worked up my re&s;entment to &s;uch a
pitch, that I determined not to &s;ee Mrs. Ar|nold
any more. To avoid expo&s;tulations, I
went to a friend's hou&s;e, at the di&s;tance of
&s;everal miles. When I came back, Mrs.
Gerrarde told me that Mr. Faulkland was
ab&s;ent from V&mdash;hall, and &s;he concluded the
lovers were now together.</P>
<P>I interrupted your hu&s;band at this part of
the &s;tory, pur&s;ued Lady V&mdash;, and told him,
that to <HI>my</HI> knowledge Mr. Faulkland had
gone to Sidney-Ca&s;tle, to &s;ee Sir George
Bidulph, before you left your own hou&s;e;
and did not &s;et out from thence on his re|turn
'till about three weeks after your &s;epara|tion;
at the account of which he was exceed|ingly
&s;urprized.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
Dear Lady V&mdash;, &s;aid he, do you think I
<HI>now</HI> want any farther arguments to convince
me what an injurious wretch I have been to
the be&s;t of women?</P>
<P>I have one ob&s;ervation to make to you,
Mr. Arnold, added I; which is, that your
lady's misfortune was intirely owing, to her
great delicacy, and the nice regard &s;he had
to your peace and honour.</P>
<P>I do not under&s;tand you, Madam, he re|plied.</P>
<P>Know then, &s;aid I, that your wife was well
acquainted with your connection with Mrs.
Gerrarde, from the very night that you found
her at the public hou&s;e, to which the accident
that happened to her obliged her to go. She
owned to me, at the time you drove her
from her home, that &s;he had di&s;covered your
amour from a conver&s;ation &s;he overheard that
night between you and Mrs. Gerrarde. This
I extorted from her, by letting her know I was
no &s;tranger to the intrigue. I then repeated
to him the di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between him
and that wicked woman, as far as you had
told me, and he very well remembered it.
Now, Mr. Arnold, &s;aid I, to prove the a&s;&s;er|tion
I made in regard to your lady, had &s;he
reproached you with your infidelity, as <HI>&s;ome</HI>
wives would have done, tho' it might have oc|ca&s;ioned
a temporary unea&s;ine&s;s to you both,
yet would it have prevented her from falling a
<PB N="58" REF="59">
&s;acrifice to that mo&s;t artful and wicked of her
&s;ex; for you could not then have had &s;uch
an improbable fal&s;hood impo&s;ed on you, as
that Mrs. Arnold would have made choice of
the <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of her hu&s;band for a confidant,
and fix on <HI>her</HI> hou&s;e, as the rendezvous for a
love intrigue. The ba&s;e woman her&s;elf had
no rea&s;on, from Mrs. Arnold's prudent and
gentle behaviour, to think &s;he was &s;u&s;pected
by her.</P>
<P>Your hu&s;band lifted up his eyes to hea|ven;
and &s;triking his brea&s;t, blind, blind
wretch, he cried! infatuated, ungrateful
mon&s;ter! are there no amends&mdash;no
amends in thy power for &s;uch goodne&s;s?</P>
<P>I could not bear &s;uch a de&s;cription of my
poor Mr. Arnold's deep contrition. I &s;top|ped
Lady V&mdash;; and, being now informed
of all I wanted to know, changed the con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 22.&mdash;We are preparing to get
into the country with all &s;peed. I have
writ to Patty to &s;et out with the two children
for Sidney-Ca&s;tle as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Mr.
Arnold has put his affairs intirely into the
hands of our worthy friend Lord V&mdash;, and
we think, upon a calculation, that what
we have in town, at South-Park, and at Ar|nold-Abbey,
will go near to an&s;wer the pre|&s;ent
demands that are upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
Lady V&mdash;is the be&s;t creature living; &s;he
knows that neither Mr. Arnold nor I chu&s;e
to &s;ee any vi&s;itors, and &s;he has let in none
the&s;e two days. I am vexed at laying her
under &s;uch a re&s;traint, though her good-na|ture
will not &s;uffer her to think it one. We
&s;hall go out of town on Monday; to mor|row
we &s;pend with my mother, as do Lord
and Lady V&mdash;(who are mightily charmed
with her), and then adieu to London, per|haps
for ever. If my mother comes down
to me, as &s;he intends to do, I &s;hall have no
temptation ever to return to it.</P>
<P>Sidney-Ca&s;tle, <DATE>December 29.</DATE></P>
<P>Here am I, my dear, in the hou&s;e of my
nativity. Your Sidney and her Arnold as
happy as a king and a queen! or, to &s;peak
more properly, happier than any king or
queen in chri&s;tendom. My two dear little
girls are well, thank God! and look charm|ingly.
Poor babes! they could have no idea
of their lo&s;s when I left them, yet they now
&s;eem plea&s;ed at &s;eeing me again. My faith|ful
Patty is almo&s;t out of her wits with joy.
I have no maid but her, and an hone&s;t &s;er|vant,
whom my mother left here to look
after her hou&s;e. Mr. Arnold has retained
but one of his men: the garden is taken care
of by an old man in the neighbourhood, to
<PB N="60" REF="61">
whom my mother allows &s;omething for keep|ing
it in order.</P>
<P>With what delight do I recall the days of
my childhood, which I pa&s;&s;ed here &s;o happily!
You, my dear Cecilia, mix your&s;elf in all
my thoughts; every &s;pot almo&s;t brings you
fre&s;h into my memory. The little filbert|wood,
the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, the mount, and
the che&s;nut-clo&s;e that you u&s;ed to love &s;o!
but the &s;ight of your old dwelling makes me
melancholy. I think I could not bear to go
into the hou&s;e; the de&s;erted avenue to me
appears much darker than it u&s;ed to do;
and your poor doves are all flying about
wild, and I think &s;eem to mourn the ab&s;ence
of their gentle mi&s;tre&s;s. Oh! Cecilia, how
exqui&s;ite are the plea&s;ures and the pains that
tho&s;e of too nice feelings are liable to! You,
who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility is as &s;trong as mine, know
this. From what trifles do minds of &s;uch a
turn derive both joy and grief! Our names,
our virgin names, I find cut out on &s;everal
of the old elm trees: this conjures up a thou|&s;and
plea&s;ing ideas, and brings back tho&s;e
days when we were in&s;eparable. But you
are no longer Rivers, nor I Bidulph. Then
I think what I have &s;uffered &s;ince I lo&s;t that
name, and at how remote a di&s;tance you are
from me; and I weep like a child&mdash;But
away with &s;uch reflections: I am now hap|pier,
beyond compari&s;on happier, I think,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
than I was before my afflictions overtook me.
Mr. Arnold's <HI>recovered</HI> heart I prize infinite|ly
more than I did when he fir&s;t made me
an offer of it; becau&s;e I am &s;ure he gives it
now from a thorough conviction that I de|&s;erve
it, and therefore I am certain never to
have it alienated again.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 4.&mdash;It is almo&s;t three years &s;ince
I left this place; and the welcomes I have
received from all our old neighbours and ac|quaintance,
have given me more &s;atisfaction
than I can expre&s;s. Mr. Arnold is highly
plea&s;ed with the marks of affection which he
&s;ees me daily receive, from tho&s;e who have
known me from my infancy. I am the more
delighted with it, as I think it gives me an
additional value with him. 'Tis a proof at
lea&s;t that I never mi&s;behaved during the
long number of years that our former friends
knew me, and we mu&s;t needs be plea&s;ed to
&s;ee the object of our love approved of by
others. This I &s;peak from my own experi|ence.
Mr. Arnold is exceedingly care&s;&s;ed
by all our friends, and &s;eems equally delight|ed
with them: you know we have &s;ome of
the be&s;t people in the world among&s;t our old
&s;et of acquaintance. If you, my mother, and
good Lady V&mdash;, were within my reach, I
&s;hould think Sidney-Ca&s;tle a paradi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
<HI>January</HI> 10.&mdash;I have had two letters to|day;
one from Lady V&mdash;, the other from
my dear mother. Lady V&mdash;tells me her
lord is bu&s;tling about for us, to put affairs
in the be&s;t condition he can. She &s;ays, he
has already got a purcha&s;er for the lea&s;e of
our hou&s;e in St. James's-Street; and all the
moveables in it, as they now &s;tand. They
have been valued at two thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
pounds. As mo&s;t of our plate is there,
as well as our chariot and a pair of hor&s;es,
this has fallen very &s;hort of our expectations;
but Lady V&mdash;&s;ays, &s;he is &s;ure there was not
more allowed for the furniture than half their
original value, though they have not been a
great while in u&s;e. She tells me, that my
lord has employed a per&s;on to go down to
Arnold-Abbey, to di&s;po&s;e of the things there;
but &s;he fears we &s;hall receive a very indiffe|rent
return from thence, as there is but part
of the furniture of Mr. Arnold's putting in,
the old goods going together with the hou&s;e
to the widow. My lord's &s;teward at V&mdash;hall
has in&s;tructions about South-Park: he writes
word to his lord, that he believes the whole
of what is there will not &s;ell for more than
four hundred pounds: the hou&s;e indeed was
but &s;mall, and the furniture not expen&s;ive.
Mrs. Gerrarde, he &s;ays, has had an attach|ment
laid on her hou&s;e by a per&s;on who built
<PB N="63" REF="64">
&s;ome bauble for her in her garden, for which
he claims a debt, of ninety pounds, though
the &s;teward &s;ays it is not worth thirty. &startq;All
things, however, my lady adds, &s;hall be
adju&s;ted in the be&s;t manner we can; and
my lord will not let Mr. Arnold be di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
on account of any deficiency that
may happen in tho&s;e &s;ales.&endq; What a jewel,
my Cecilia, is an hone&s;t warm friend!</P>
<P>The contents of my mother's letter are,
That Sir George was married ye&s;terday to
Lady Sarah P&mdash;. She &s;ays, the bride was
mo&s;t extravagantly fine; but looked neither
hand&s;ome nor genteel. This was much for
my good mother to let drop from her pen;
but I know &s;he never liked Lady Sarah, nor
did her lady&s;hip ever treat her with the re|gard
due to her character, and to the per&s;on
of one who was to &s;tand in the clo&s;e and re|&s;pectable
degree of relation&s;hip to her, which
my mother now does. But I believe I have
before told you, that the ble&s;&s;ings of good
&s;en&s;e and good temper are be&s;towed but in
a moderate degree on Lady Sarah; and for
a woman of quality, Lady V&mdash;tells me (for
I have never &s;een her), that her breeding is
not of the highe&s;t form. But you know a
great fortune covers a multitude of imper|fections
in the eyes of mo&s;t people, and I
hope her love for my brother will make her
a good wife.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
<HI>January</HI> 23.&mdash;I am grown a perfect far|mer's
wife, and have got a notable dairy;
I am mi&s;tre&s;s of three cows, I a&s;&s;ure you,
which more than &s;upply my family; then I
have the be&s;t poultry in the country, and my
garden flouri&s;hes like Eden. Mr. Arnold
is &s;uch a &s;port&s;man that we have more game
than we know what to do with; but his
chief plea&s;ure is hunting.</P>
<P>Your little name&s;ake promi&s;es to be the
greate&s;t beauty in the county. Dolly, who
is a pretty little cherry-cheek, and her fa|ther's
great favourite, prates like a parrot.
How delightful will be the ta&s;k of expanding
and forming the minds of the&s;e two cherubs!
how joyfully and how thankfully do I look
back on the troubled &s;ea which I have pa&s;|&s;ed!
My voyage indeed was not long, but
my &s;ufferings were great while they la&s;ted.
I never, &s;ince I was married, enjoyed life
till now. You know my match was origi|nally
the re&s;ult of duty to the be&s;t of mo|thers;
and though, if I ever knew my own
heart, it was ab&s;olutely freed from all attach|ment
to any other per&s;on, yet was it not &s;o
devoted to Mr. Arnold, as to have made
him my choice preferably to all other men,
if I had not re&s;olved in <HI>this,</HI> as in every
other action of my life, to be determined by
tho&s;e to whom I owed obedience. When I
<PB N="65" REF="66">
married Mr. Arnold, I e&s;teemed him; a
&s;ufficient foundation, in the per&s;on of a hu&s;|band,
whereon to build love. That love,
his kindne&s;s, and my own gratitude, in a little
time produced in my heart; and I will ven|ture
to &s;ay few wives loved &s;o well, none bet|ter.
You know I could never bear to con|&s;ider
love as a childi&s;h divinity, who exer|ci&s;es
his power by throwing the heart into
tumultuous raptures: <HI>my</HI> love, tho' of a more
temperate kind, was &s;ufficiently &s;ervent to
make Mr. Arnold's coldne&s;s towards me
alone capable of wounding my heart mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ibly; but when this coldne&s;s was aggra|vated
by the cruel di&s;tru&s;t which he was
taught to entertain of me, the blow indeed
became &s;carce &s;upportable; and I did not
till then know the progre&s;s he had made in
my affections.</P>
<P>Sorrows, my Cecilia, &s;often and &s;ubdue
the mind prodigiou&s;ly; and I think my heart
was better prepared from its &s;ufferings to re|ceive
Mr. Arnold's returning tenderne&s;s, than
an age of court&s;hip in the gay and pro&s;pe|rous
days of life could have framed it to.
I exult in his re&s;tored affections, and love
him a thou&s;and times better than ever I did.
He de&s;erves it; I am &s;ure he does: he was
led away from me by enchantment; nothing
el&s;e could have done it. But the charm is
broke, thank heaven! and I find him now
<PB N="66" REF="67">
the tendere&s;t, the be&s;t of men. Every look,
every word, every action of his life, is ex|pre&s;&s;ive
of a love next to adoration. Oh!
I &s;hould be too happy if the ble&s;&s;ings I now
po&s;&s;e&s;s were to be my continued portion in
this life! There is, however, but <HI>one</HI> about
which I can rationally indulge any fears&mdash;
My mother&mdash;Her years, and her growing
infirmities, will not &s;uffer me to hope for her
being long ab&s;ent from her final place of feli|city.
You always u&s;ed to &s;ay I anticipated mis|fortunes:
this event <HI>may</HI> be farther off than
my anxious fears &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;t to me;
&s;o no more of it.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 10.&mdash;My good Lady V&mdash;writes
me word, that all our bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed,
The whole amount of our effects came but
to three thou&s;and four hundred pounds; our
debts (including &s;ome charges which have
occurred in the tran&s;acting of our affairs) ex|ceeded
eight thou&s;and. Our worthy Lord
V&mdash;has paid the whole, and has made him|&s;elf
our only creditor. We have nothing
now, that we can call our own, but my join|ture.
I do not reckon upon my mother's
bounty to us; our income from her, and
the hou&s;e we live in, will be Sir George's,
whenever it is our misfortune to lo&s;e her.
But &s;he tells me &s;he is well, and talks of
coming down in about a fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">
<HI>March</HI> 11.&mdash;I am here in a &s;cene of &s;till
life, my dear; and you mu&s;t now expect to
hear of nothing but &s;uch trivial matters as
u&s;ed to be the &s;ubjects of our journals when
we were both girls, and you lived within a
bow &s;hot of Sidney-Ca&s;tle, and &s;aw me eve|ry
day. The la&s;t three months of my life
have glided away like a &s;mooth &s;tream, when
there is not a breath of wind to ruffle it; and
after you have read the tran&s;actions of one
day, you know how I pa&s;s all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I have told you of every-body that came
to &s;ee me, and all the vi&s;its that I returned:
I have given you an account of all our old
acquaintance, and of &s;ome new ones. You
know what my amu&s;ements are, and what
my bu&s;ine&s;s. Indeed, what I call bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
is my chief plea&s;ure. You, who
are &s;urrounded by the gaieties of a &s;plen|did
court, had need of the partiality which
I know you have for your Sidney, to de&s;ire
a continuation of her in&s;ipid narrative. But,
I &s;uppo&s;e, if I were to tell you, that, on &s;uch
a day, my white Guiney-hen brought out a
fine brood of chickens, you might be as well
plea&s;ed with it, as I &s;hould be to hear from
you of the birth of an arch-dutche&s;s. In|deed,
my Cecilia, there is &s;uch a &s;amene&s;s in
my now-tranquil days, that I believe I mu&s;t
have recour&s;e to telling you my dreams, to
furni&s;h out matter of variety.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
<HI>March</HI> 19.&mdash;We have had a wedding to|day
in our neighbourhood. Young Main
(Patty's brother) has got a very pretty young
gentlewoman, with a fortune of five thou|&s;and
pounds. It &s;eems, this pair had been
fond of each other from their Childhood;
but the girl's fortune put her above her lo|ver's
hopes: however, as he has, for a good
while, been in very great bu&s;ine&s;s, and has the
reputation of being better &s;killed in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion
than any one in the country, he was
in hopes, that his character, his mi&s;tre&s;s's af|fection
for him, and his own con&s;tancy,
would have &s;ome little weight with her fa|mily.
Accordingly he ventured to make his
application to the young woman's brother,
at who&s;e di&s;po&s;al &s;he was, her father having
been dead for &s;ome years; but he was re|jected
with &s;corn, and forbid the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The girl's father, it &s;eems, had been an
humouri&s;t, and left her the fortune under a
&s;evere re&s;triction; for, if ever &s;he married
without her brother's con&s;ent, &s;he was to lo&s;e
it; &s;o that, in that particular in&s;tance of di&s;|po&s;ing
of her per&s;on, &s;he was never to be
her own mi&s;tre&s;s. In the di&s;po&s;al of her for|tune,
however, he did not &s;o tie her up; for
after the age of one-and-twenty, &s;he had the
power of bequeathing her fortune by will to
whom &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
The brother, who is a very hone&s;t man,
had no motive, but a regard to his &s;i&s;ter's in|tere&s;t,
in refu&s;ing poor Mr. Main: a man
of a good fortune had propo&s;ed for her,
whom the brother importuned her to accept
of; but &s;he was firm to her fir&s;t attachment.</P>
<P>The young lover found means to convey
a letter to his mi&s;tre&s;s, in which he told her,
that as he was in circum&s;tances to &s;upport
her genteelly, if &s;he would venture to ac|cept
of his hand, he would never more be&s;tow
a thought on her fortune. This propo&s;al the
prudent young woman declined on her own
part, but advi&s;ed him to make it to her bro|ther,
as &s;he was not then without &s;u&s;picions
that he wi&s;hed to retain her fortune in the fa|mily;
and that it was only to &s;ave appearan|ces
he had propo&s;ed a match to her, of which
he was &s;ure &s;he would not accept. But in this
opinion &s;he injured him. She thought, how|ever,
the experiment might be of u&s;e, in
giving the better colour to her marrying
afterwards the man whom &s;he loved.</P>
<P>But it was an ill-judged attempt, and
&s;ucceeded accordingly: for, if the brother
&s;hould have given his con&s;ent, he could
have no pretence for with-holding her por|tion;
or, if he did &s;o by mutual agreement,
his motive for denying his con&s;ent be|fore,
mu&s;t appear too obviou&s;ly to be a
bad one.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
The young people, not con&s;idering this
&s;ufficiently, re&s;olved to make the trial; ac|cordingly
Mr. Main wrote to the brother
a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter, telling him he
would, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, relin|qui&s;h
all claim to his &s;i&s;ter's fortune, if,
he would make him happy by con&s;enting
to their marriage; without which he &s;aid,
the young lady's regard for her brother,
would not &s;uffer her to take &s;uch a &s;tep.</P>
<P>This letter had no other effect than that
of making the brother extremely angry.
He &s;ent a &s;evere me&s;&s;age to the young man,
to acquaint him, that he looked upon
his propo&s;al as a mo&s;t injurious affront
to his character; but that he was ready
to convince him, and every-body el&s;e, that
he had no de&s;igns upon his &s;i&s;ter's for|tune,
as he would not refu&s;e his con&s;ent to
her marriage with any other man in the
country but him&s;elf. This was a thun|der-clap
to the poor lover: he comforted
him&s;elf, however, with the hopes that his
mi&s;tre&s;s's heart would determine her in his
favour, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the
brother.</P>
<P>There had been, it &s;eems, be&s;ides this
gentleman's not thinking Main a &s;uitable
match for his &s;i&s;ter, &s;ome old family pique
between him and Mr. Main's father.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">
The&s;e tran&s;actions happened &s;ome time
before I came to the country. Ju&s;t about
that juncture, the poor girl had the mi&s;|fortune
to receive a hurt in her brea&s;t, by
falling again&s;t the &s;harp corner of a de&s;k
from a &s;tool, on which &s;he had &s;tood in
order to reach down a book that was in a
little ca&s;e over it. This accident threw her
into a fit of illne&s;s, which put a &s;top to
all corre&s;pondence between her and her
lover.</P>
<P>In this illne&s;s, a fever, which was her
apparent complaint, was the only thing
to which the phy&s;ician paid attention, and
the hurt in her brea&s;t was not enquired
after; &s;o that by the time &s;he was tolerably
recovered from the former, the latter was
di&s;covered to be in a very dangerous way,
and required the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a
&s;urgeon. You may be &s;ure poor Main was
not the per&s;on pitched upon to attend her;
another was called in, of le&s;s &s;kill, but not
&s;o obnoxious to the family.</P>
<P>By this bungler &s;he was tortured for near
three months; at the end of which time,
through improper treatment, the malady was
&s;o far increa&s;ed, that the operator declared
the brea&s;t mu&s;t be taken off, as the only
po&s;&s;ible means of &s;aving her life.</P>
<P>The young gentlewoman's family were all
in the greate&s;t affliction; &s;he her&s;elf &s;eemed
<PB N="72" REF="73">
the only compo&s;ed per&s;on among&s;t them:
She appointed the day when &s;he was to un|dergo
this &s;evere trial of her fortitude; it
was at the di&s;tance of about a week. The
&s;urgeon objected to the having it put off &s;o
long, but &s;he was peremptory, and at la&s;t
prevailed.</P>
<P>On the evening preceding the appointed
day, the conjured her brother in the mo&s;t
earne&s;t manner, to permit Mr. Main to be
pre&s;ent at the operation. The brother was
unwilling to comply, as he thought it might
very much di&s;compo&s;e her, but &s;he was &s;o
extremely pre&s;&s;ing, that he was con&s;trained
to yield.</P>
<P>The attending &s;urgeon was con&s;ulted on
the occa&s;ion; who having declared, that he
had no objection to Mr. Main's being pre|&s;ent,
that young man was &s;ent to. He had
been quite incon&s;olable at the accounts he
received, of the dangerous &s;tate in which
his mi&s;tre&s;s was, and went with an aching
heart to her brother's hou&s;e in the morning.</P>
<P>He was introduced into her chamber,
where he found the whole chirurgical appa|ratus
ready. The young woman her&s;elf was
in her clo&s;et, but came out in a few minutes,
with a countenance perfectly &s;erene. She
&s;eated her&s;elf in an elbow chair, and de&s;ired
&s;he might be indulged for a quarter of an
hour, to &s;peak a few words, to her brother,
<PB N="73" REF="74">
before they proceeded to their work. Her
brother was immediately called to her, when
taking him by the hand, &s;he reque&s;ted him
to &s;it down by her.</P>
<P>You have, &s;aid &s;he, been a father to me,
&s;ince I lo&s;t my own; I acknowledge your
tenderne&s;s and your care of me with grati|tude.
I believe your refu&s;al of me to Mr.
Main, was from no other motive, but your
de&s;ire of &s;eeing me matched to a richer
man. I therefore freely forgive you that on|ly
act, in which you ever exerci&s;ed the au|thority
my father gave you over me. My
life, I now apprehend, is in imminent dan|ger,
the hazard nearly equal, whether I do,
or do not undergo the operation; but as
they tell me there is a chance in my favour
on one &s;ide, I am determined to &s;ubmit to
it.</P>
<P>I put it off to this day, on account of its
being my birth-day. I am now one and
twenty, and as the con&s;equences of what I
have to go through, may deprive me of the
power of doing what I intended, I have &s;pent
this morning in making my will. You,
brother, have an ample fortune; I have no
poor relations; I ho$e, therefore, I &s;hall
&s;tand ju&s;tified to the world, for having
made Mr. Main my heir. Saying this, &s;he
pulled a paper from under her gown, which
&s;he put into her brother's hand, that he
<PB N="74" REF="75">
might read it. It was her will, wrote by
her&s;elf, regularly &s;igned, and witne&s;&s;ed by
two &s;ervants of the family.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, turning to the other &s;urgeon,
as &s;oon as my brother is withdrawn, I am
ready for you. You may imagine this had
various effects on the different per&s;ons con|cerned.
The brother, however di&s;plea&s;ed he
might have been at this act of his &s;i&s;ter's,
had too much humanity to make any ani|madver&s;ions
on it at that time. He returned
the paper to his &s;i&s;ter without &s;peaking, and
retired.</P>
<P>Poor Main, who had &s;tood at the back of
her chair, from his fir&s;t coming in, had been
endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;e his tears all the
time; but at this proof of his mi&s;tre&s;s's
tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity, it was no long|er
in his power to do &s;o, and they bur&s;t
from him with the utmo&s;t violence of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The other &s;urgeon de&s;ired him to com|po&s;e
him&s;elf, for that they were lo&s;ing time,
and the lady would be too much ruffled.</P>
<P>The heroic young woman, with a &s;miling
countenance, begged of him to dry his eyes:
perhaps, &s;aid &s;he, I may recover. Then
fixing her&s;elf firmly in the chair, &s;he pro|nounced
with much compo&s;ure, &startq;I am rea|dy.&endq;
Two maid &s;ervants &s;tood one at each
&s;ide of her, and the &s;urgeon drew near to do
his painful work. He had uncovered her
<PB N="75" REF="76">
bo&s;om, and taken off the dre&s;&s;ings, when Mr.
Main, ca&s;ting his eyes at her brea&s;t, begged
he might have leave to examine it before
they proceeded. The other &s;urgeon, with
&s;ome indignation, &s;aid, his doing &s;o was only
an unnece&s;&s;ary delay; and had, already laid
hold of his knife, when Mr. Main having
looked at it, &s;aid, he was of opinion it might
be &s;aved, without endangering the lady's
life. The other, with a contemptuous
&s;mile, told him, he was &s;orry he thought
him &s;o ignorant of his profe&s;&s;ion, and with|out
much ceremony, putting him a&s;ide, was
about to proceed to the operation; when
Mr. Main laying hold of him, &s;aid, that
he never &s;hould do it in his pre&s;ence; adding,
with &s;ome warmth, that he would engage
to make a perfect cure of it in a month,
without the pain or hazard of amputati|on.</P>
<P>The young lady, who had been an eye|witne&s;s
of what pa&s;&s;ed, for &s;he would not
&s;uffer her face to be covered, now thought
it proper to interpo&s;e. She told the un|feeling
operator, that he might be very
&s;ure &s;he would embrace any di&s;tant hope
of &s;aving her&s;elf from the pain, the dan|ger,
and the lo&s;s &s;he mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain, if he
pur&s;ued the method he intended. She
was not, however, &s;o irre&s;olute, &s;he &s;aid,
as to de&s;ire either to avoid or po&s;tpone
<PB N="76" REF="77">
the operation, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary;
but as there was hope given her of a cure
without it, &s;he thought it but rea&s;onable to
make the experiment; and &s;hould therefore
refer the deci&s;ion of her ca&s;e to a third per|&s;on
of &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion, by who&s;e opini|on
&s;he would be determined.</P>
<P>The two women &s;ervants, who are always
profe&s;&s;ed enemies to chirurgical operations,
readily joined in her &s;entiments, and &s;aying
it was a mortal &s;in to cut and hack any chri&s;|tian,
they made ha&s;te to cover up their young
lady again.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointed &s;urgeon hardly forbore
rude language to the women; and telling
Mr. Main he would make him know what it
was to traduce the &s;kill of a practitioner of
his &s;tanding, marched off in a violent pa&s;|&s;ion,
&s;aying to his patient, if &s;he had a mind
to kill her&s;elf, it was nothing to him.</P>
<P>The mode&s;t young man, delighted to find
the ca&s;e of his beloved not &s;o de&s;perate as he
had &s;uppo&s;ed it to be, begged &s;he would per|mit
him to apply &s;ome proper dre&s;&s;ings to the
afflicted part, and conjuring her to call in the
aid of the able&s;t &s;urgeon that could be procu|red,
took his leave.</P>
<P>The brother of the lady being apprized of
what had pa&s;&s;ed, lo&s;t no time in &s;ending an
expre&s;s to Bath; and by a very hand&s;ome
gratuity, induced a &s;urgeon of great emi|nence
<PB N="77" REF="78">
to &s;et out immediately for his hou&s;e,
who arrived early the next morning. But in
the mean time poor Main had like to have
paid dear for his &s;uperior &s;kill in his profe&s;|&s;ion.
The other &s;urgeon had no &s;ooner got
home, than he &s;ent him a challenge, to meet
him that evening, in a field at &s;ome di&s;tance
from the town. They met; Main had the
good fortune, after wounding, to di&s;arm, his
antagoni&s;t, but fir&s;t received him&s;elf a dan|gerous
wound.</P>
<P>This accident was kept from the knowledge
of his mi&s;tre&s;s; but on the arrival of the &s;ur|geon
from Bath, as he would not take off the
dre&s;&s;ings, but in the pre&s;ence of the per&s;on
who put them on, it was thought proper that
both Mr. Main and the other man &s;hould be
&s;ent for. The latter was not by any means
in a condition to attend; but the former,
though very ill and feveri&s;h, de&s;ired that he
might be carried to the hou&s;e. The Bath &s;ur|geon
having, in his and the brother's pre|&s;ence,
examined the ca&s;e, declared it as his
opinion, that the complaint might be remo|ved
without amputation; adding, that it was
owing to wrong management that the grie|vance
had gone &s;o far. He con&s;ulted with
Main, in the pre&s;ence of the family, as to
his intended method of treating it for the fu|ture;
he agreed with him intirely, with re|gard
to the propriety of it; and having a&s;&s;u|red
<PB N="78" REF="79">
the friends of the girl, that he thought him
a &s;kilful and ingenious young man, took his
leave, being obliged to return directly home.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of this gentleman, who&s;e
&s;kill was undoubted, and who&s;e impartiality
mu&s;t be &s;o too, having never &s;een any of the
parties concerned in his life before, wrought
&s;o much on the brother of the lady, that he
did not he&s;itate to put his &s;i&s;ter under the
care of her lover.</P>
<P>Poor Main, though &s;carce able to leave
his bed for &s;ome time, was neverthele&s;s car|ried
to his patient every day, at the hazard
of his life. His &s;kill, his tenderne&s;s, and his
a&s;&s;iduity, were all exerted in a particular
manner on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; and in le&s;s
than, five weeks he had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee his
mi&s;tre&s;s re&s;tored to perfect health.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of this incident was ve|ry
happy for them both; the brother, ex|ceedingly
plea&s;ed at his whole behaviour,
told him, he was an hone&s;t generous fellow;
and &s;ince he was convinced it was his &s;i&s;ter's
per&s;on, and not her fortune he was attached
to, he would, with all his heart, be&s;tow
both on him; and accordingly Mr. Arnold
and I had this day the &s;atisfaction of &s;ee|ing
this worthy young pair united in mar|riage.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
My Patty is not a little delighted at her
brother's good fortune. The hone&s;t youth,
who has ever &s;ince his father's death &s;upport|ed
his mother, and as many of the younger
children as were not able to gain their own
livelihood, has now invited his &s;i&s;ter Patty to
live with him; but the faithful girl declined
the offer; telling her brother, &s;he would ne|ver
quit me, while I thought her worthy of
my regard.</P>
<P>I lo$k upon my&s;elf to be much obliged to
her for this, as the &s;tation &s;he is now in, can|not
be &s;o advantageous as I hoped to make it,
when I fir&s;t took her into my &s;ervice; but I
will make up in kindne&s;s what may be want|ing
in profit. Indeed I con&s;ider her rather
as a friend than a &s;ervant, and Mr. Arnold
always treats her with re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 20.&mdash;I am very unea&s;y at not
having it in my power to fulfil my promi&s;e to
poor mi&s;s Burchell; but that is a &s;tring I
dare not as yet touch upon. Indeed I can|not
bear any conver&s;ation that leads to the
&s;ubject. Whenever Mr. Arnold begins to
accu&s;e him&s;elf for his unhappy conduct, in re|lation
to Mrs. Gerrarde, which he often does,
I always &s;top him, or turn the di&s;cour&s;e to
&s;omething el&s;e. He never &s;peaks of her now,
but with a contemptuous indifference; and
is &s;o firmly per&s;uaded that &s;he went off wil|lingly
<PB N="80" REF="81">
with Mr. Faulkland, that I dare not as
yet undeceive him; which I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
do, &s;hould I expre&s;s even a wi&s;h that Mr.
Faulkland &s;hould repair the niece's wrongs by
marriage. Mr. Arnold knows nothing of
mi&s;s Burchell's affair. I went once &s;o far as
to &s;ay I had heard Mr. Faulkland formerly
liked this young lady. Mr. Arnold an&s;wer|ed,
I am glad it went no farther than liking;
if it had, probably I &s;hould not have been
&s;o &s;oon delivered from my thraldom to her
aunt. This reply &s;ilenced me; I am exceed|ingly
perplexed about it. Would to Heaven
Mr. Faulkland would of him&s;elf think of do|ing
the amiable unhappy girl ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>My mother writes me word, that Sir
George had informed Mr. Faulkland, by
letter, of the &s;ucce&s;s of his project, and
that his an&s;wer was full of congratulations,
and expre&s;&s;ions of joy. He is now in Ita|ly;
but talks of returning to England next
&s;ummer. He &s;ays, he hears &s;ometimes from
Pivet, and that he and his wife live very well
together.</P>
<P>My mother &s;ays &s;he often &s;ees mi&s;s Bur|chell,
and that &s;he encourages her with the
hope of what may happen when Mr. Faul|land
comes back. If this match &s;hould ever
take place, it would give me mo&s;t &s;incere
&s;atisfaction. The girl's family is not con|temptible;
her fortune is pretty large, her
<PB N="81" REF="82">
per&s;on lovely; the unfortunate fal&s;e &s;tep &s;he
made, is an entire &s;ecret, except to the per|&s;ons
immediately concerned; &s;o that with
regard to the world, her character too is
good. Mrs. Gerrarde, at wor&s;t, was only
her aunt by marriage; but if that circum|&s;tance
&s;hould be the only rub in her way to
happine&s;s, I would &s;ooner declare the whole
affair, and run the ri&s;k of Mr. Arnold's
being let into this tickli&s;h &s;ecret, than be a
hindrance to the poor young creature's wel|fare.
This affair never comes a-cro&s;s me,
but it makes me &s;igh. God &s;end, a favour|able
i&s;&s;ue to it!</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26.&mdash;Alas! my Cecilia, we have
received mo&s;t heavy news! My good, lord
V&mdash;, that &s;tedfa&s;t, that worthy, that
be&s;t of friends, is no more! He was prepar|ing
to go to V&mdash;hall, three days ago, but
was &s;eized with an apoplexy, as he was com|ing
down &s;tairs to go into his coach, and di|ed
before any a&s;&s;i&s;tance could reach him.
Oh! we have a &s;evere lo&s;s in the death of
this mo&s;t dear and valuable man&mdash;but
why do I mention <HI>our</HI> lo&s;s?&mdash;his lady&mdash;
poor $word$ V&mdash;is almo&s;t di&s;tracted&mdash;
and well &s;he may&mdash;the be&s;t of hu&s;bands,
fathers, every thing! His elde&s;t &s;on, who
is abroad, is &s;ent for home on this melancho|ly
occa&s;ion&mdash;My poor mother is afflicted
<PB N="82" REF="83">
exceedingly: every body that knew him
mu&s;t be &s;o. Mr. Arnold and I have lo&s;t
more than a father. How <HI>&s;elf</HI> recurs every
minute; let me think of lady V&mdash;again,
and not dare to complain on my own account;
but my obligations to him were of &s;uch a
nature, as claim all my gratitude to his me|mory,
and all the tears that I have abundant|ly
&s;hed for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold is largely in his debt, we have
no room to expect the &s;ame friend&s;hip from
the pre&s;ent lord V&mdash;, that we experienced
from his father.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance did not occur to me till
poor Mr. Arnold put me in the mind of it:
my thoughts were too much ab&s;orbed in
grief, which the death alone of our friend
occa&s;ioned. My mother hinted at it too,
in her letter to Mr. Arnold; for it was
to him &s;he wrote the mournful tidings.</P>
<P>What a dark cloud of &s;orrow is now
&s;pread over Sidney-ca&s;tle! and how this
&s;troke has imbittered our little dome&s;tick
joys! But let me not carry my complainings
into pre&s;umptuous murmurings. I have
lo&s;t a &s;incere and truly valued friend; but
do I not &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s infinite ble&s;&s;ings?
My hu&s;band, my dear Mr. Arnold, my two
&s;weet children, the be&s;t of mothers, and thee,
my ever-beloved Cecilia, whom I &s;till
<PB N="83" REF="84">
call mine, though at &s;uch a di&s;tance from
me.</P>
<P>Then I comfort my&s;elf with reflecting
that lady V&mdash;has &s;ons, who, I hope, will
be a ble&s;&s;ing to her; that h$r fortune is af|fluent,
and that my lord had pa&s;&s;ed through
a well-&s;pent life, to a pretty advanced
age. He was turned of &s;ixty. All the&s;e
con&s;iderations &s;ooth my mind, and I acknow|ledge,
that, upon the whole, I have, by
far more cau&s;e to be thankful, than to re|pine.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 30.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;'s journey
down to V&mdash;hall having been &s;o fatally
prevented, &s;he is obliged to remain in Lon|don.
The &s;hock &s;he received has brought
on her a fit of illne&s;s. I find my lord has
not left any ready money; his fortune was
large, but as they always lived in great
&s;plendor, he laid none of his income by:
the whole &s;um which he could com|mand,
he laid out for our u&s;e. My la|dy's
jointure is pretty con&s;iderable; if it
were ten times more, &s;he de&s;erves it. Oh,
may her &s;ons prove worthy of &s;uch a pa|rent!
The younge&s;t I hear is a very fine
youth. He is come to her from Oxford to
comfort her, till the arrival of his elder bro|ther.</P>

My mother writes me word, that her
old friend lady Grim&s;ton is dead! She has
left her whole fortune to charitable u&s;es:
not a &s;ixpence to either of her daughters.
Poor Mrs. Vere! She is content with her
little income, and has no lo&s;s of &s;o unnatural
a parent, who carried her vindictive &s;pirit
with her to the grave. As for the elde&s;t,
&s;he did not &s;tand in need of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from her; but I own, though I had no great
e&s;teem for lady Grim&s;ton, I could not help
being &s;hocked at the brutal behaviour of her
&s;on-in-law to her in her la&s;t hours. She had ne|ver
&s;een either him or her daughter, from the
time I told you they had quarrelled; but
when &s;he found her&s;elf dying, &s;he &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age to this favourite daughter, de&s;ir|ing
to &s;ee her; her hu&s;band, whether
out of di&s;regard to the old lady, or his
wife, or both, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to let her
go. My Mother remarks on this pa&s;&s;age
in the&s;e words, &startq;Thus was this unfortu|nate
parent puni&s;hed in kind, for deny|ing
her late hu&s;band the &s;atisfaction of

was in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with her|&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>My mother is neverthele&s;s very much
troubled for the death of her old acquain|tance;
who, &s;he &s;ays, was a valuable wo|man:
&s;he con&s;iders her decea&s;e as a me|mento,
which warns her of her own ap|proaching

end; for they were ju&s;t of an
age.</P>
<P>I fear my mother is not well, though
&s;he does not &s;ay &s;o; for &s;he has put off her
coming down to Sidney-ca&s;tle, without giv|ing
me a rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 22.&mdash;I thank you, my beloved
Cecilia, for your cordial wi&s;h. Your opini|on,
that all my troubles are at an end, is
con&s;onant to your de&s;ires, but I doubt far
from the real fact. The young lord V&mdash;
is returned home; but oh! how unlike that
hone&s;t man, who&s;e title and fortune he inhe|rits!
How deceived were his worthy parents
in their hopes of him! he is a &s;tranger to
every &s;entiment of virtue. I have had a
letter this day from my lady V&mdash;, wherein
&s;he laments the degeneracy of her &s;on,
whom they were made to believe a pattern of
excellence: but the tutor to whom they en|tru&s;ted
him was as profligate as him&s;elf. In
&s;hort, &s;he &s;ays he is quite a reprobate; &s;he
has not the lea&s;t authority or influence over
him; &s;he laments this, particularly on our
account; we are indebted to him near five
thou&s;and pounds, and my lady &s;ays, &s;he fears
he will pre&s;s Mr. Arnold. He is profu&s;e, &s;he
&s;ays, in his expences, without being gene|rous.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
What can we do, my dear? There is not
the lea&s;t pro&s;pect now of our being able to
pay this money, but by our &s;elling the only
remaining &s;take we have left. Had my lord
lived, he made us hope that by his Intere&s;t
he could procure Mr. Arnold &s;ome employ|ment,
which would have enabled him to
di&s;charge this debt at his ea&s;e, without our
being obliged to &s;trip our&s;elves of our all.
As we purpo&s;ed living with the utmo&s;t oeco|nomy,
this might have been accompli&s;hed in
a few years. This pro&s;pect is now lo&s;t to us.
We mu&s;t &s;ubmit. I have begged of Mr.
Arnold to think immediately of &s;elling my
jointure, for we have no rea&s;on to expect
any lenity from a man of &s;uch a character as
the pre&s;ent lord V&mdash;is. We can &s;ub&s;i&s;t
upon the income, which my mother is &s;o
good as to allow us: it is precarious it is true,
but &s;omething may happen; I rely on that
providence, who has hitherto protected me.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 28.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;'s apprehen&s;ions
were but too well founded. We have had
a letter from her &s;on's agent. The debt
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> be paid; and we are come to a re&s;olu|tion
to &s;ell two hundred and fifty pounds a
year. We &s;hall then have but fifty pounds
a year in the world which we can call our
own! I reckon not upon my Mother's life;
the&s;e afflictions, I fear, will ha&s;ten her depar|ture
<PB N="87" REF="88">
to another world. From Sir George we
have nothing to expect: he is ab&s;orbed in
vanity; his new alliances engro&s;s him in|tirely.</P>
<P>My dear lady V&mdash;writes us word, &s;he will
do her utmo&s;t to promote Mr. Arnold's in|tere&s;t.
She has numerous and powerful
friends; and &s;ays, &s;he makes ho doubt of
obtaining &s;omething for him worth his ac|ceptance.
Believe me, my Cecilia, I am not
di&s;heartened at this fre&s;h blow. If my dear
Mr. Arnold could reconcile him&s;elf to it,
I could be well contented. I will not now
(though you u&s;ed to accu&s;e me of it) antici|pate
misfortunes; we have &s;till enough for
the pre&s;ent to live on decently; and if my
lady V&mdash;'s kind endeavours &s;hould &s;ucceed,
we may yet be happily provided for. I will
not let the thought of my mother's death in|terfere:
let me but calm the anxious fears
of my poor Mr. Arnold, and all will be
well.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12&mdash;Thank God we have done

mind more at ea&s;e, and reconciled to his lot.
To lady V&mdash;'s goodne&s;s, as well as my own
earne&s;t endeavours, I impute this. She &s;ays,

&s;he has the promi&s;e of an honourable and a

a better, and &s;he &s;ays, &s;he has the word of an

obliged to part with her jointure), if I &s;hould
die before you; and then he cried, and wrung
his hands My lady begged of him to put
&s;uch melancholy thoughts out of his head,
&s;aying, they never di&s;turbed her. I hope,
&s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall never &s;ee your death; but
if it plea&s;es God to puni&s;h me &s;o far, a little,
a very little, will content me for the re&s;t of
my days. My ma&s;ter embraced her, and the
children; and &s;aid, if heaven &s;pared him
life, he would yet be the happie&s;t man in the
world. Many a time have I been witne&s;s to
&s;uch di&s;cour&s;e between them; for they knew
my love for them was &s;o great, that they
would never &s;cruple talking of their affairs
before me. Oh! madam, I believe there
was never a truer penitent than my ma&s;ter,
My dear lady has &s;aid to me, &s;ince they were
forced to &s;ell her jointure, Patty, though we
are now reduced to little more than two hun|dred
pounds a year, I have much more com|fort
than when we had twelve. I have the
&s;atisfaction of &s;eeing Mr. Arnold &s;uch as I
wi&s;h him; he is an a tered man, Patty; he
is truly virtuous, and I am &s;ure he loves me
now from right rea&s;on. I am content with
the little that is left us.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
I always prayed for her pro&s;perity; but
madam, God is plea&s;ed to order things other|wi&s;e
than we poor &s;illy mortals think the be&s;t.
My lady has always been good, and pious,
and I hope, he will yet bring her out of her
troubles, tho' they are great and many.</P>
<P>My lady always charged me to be minute,
and to write particulars; but, good madam,
excu&s;e the &s;illy way I put my words together&punc;
I have not yet come to the di&s;mal part of my
&s;tory, and I hardly know how to go on, for
indeed I am forced to break off every now
and then to cry. Rea&s;on enough I have, to
be &s;ure; but what is <HI>my</HI> &s;orrow compared to
my lady's!</P>
<P>The day before ye&s;terday my ma&s;ter was
a&s;ked by &s;ome gentlemen in our neighbour|hood
to go a hunting; he had no mind to
go, for my lady was not very well, and he was
unwilling to leave her; but &s;he per&s;uaded
him, becau&s;e &s;he knew he loved hunting
dearly; &s;he has blamed her&s;elf for it ever
&s;ince, but &s;he could not know by enchant|ment
what was to happen. He left my lady
in bed, and went out about five o'clock in the
morning. At eight, as my lady was &s;itting
at breakfa&s;t, and I attending, the other maid
called me out. Our man, who had gone
abroad with my ma&s;ter, was in the kitchen,
and looked as pale as death. I asked him
what was the matter? The poor fellow could
<PB N="92" REF="93">
hardly &s;peak; but at la&s;t &s;aid, my ma&s;ter
has got a de&s;perate fall in leaping a ditch, and
I am afraid has hurt his &s;kull: he is lying
at farmer Hill's cottage, and one of the
gentlemen is rid off for a &s;urgeon; but that
is no place for him, we mu&s;t get him home:
but I thought it be&s;t to prepare my lady
before &s;he &s;ees him. My lady rung her
bell before I could an&s;wer him; I ran in,
but I am &s;ure I looked like a gho&s;t, for my
lady &s;tarted when &s;he &s;aw me. Ble&s;s me!
Patty, &s;aid &s;he, what is the matter? Has
any thing happened to your ma&s;ter? Not
much, Madam, &s;aid I. He is killed, &s;he cri|ed,
and &s;prung out of her chair. Indeed
he is not, Madam, I an&s;wered, &s;tanding be|tween
her and the door; but he has got a
fall, and is a little hurt. She made me no
an&s;wer, but &s;lew down &s;tairs, out at the front
door, and down the avenue as quick as an
arrow. I ran after her, and the other &s;er|vants
after me; we could not overtake her;
but &s;he was &s;oon &s;topped, for &s;he met my
poor ma&s;ter borne by four men. I &s;up|po&s;e
&s;he thought he was dead, for &s;he faint|ed
away directly, and we carried her in after
him.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter was put to bed; he was
alive, but not able to &s;peak. He had got a
dreadful cut in his head, and was &s;adly brui|&s;ed
be&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
As &s;oon as my lady came to her&s;elf, we
told her my ma&s;ter was not killed. She
went into his room, but had not power to
&s;peak, but &s;at like a &s;tone &s;tatue at his bed|&s;ide.
The &s;urgeon came in le&s;s than half
an hour. I believe he is but a &s;orry one;
for after he had dre&s;&s;ed the wound, he &s;aid
there was no danger in it. At fir&s;t we were
all in hopes that it was &s;o; for about two o'
clock my ma&s;ter got his &s;peech again; he
complained of &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach, and
violent pains all over him.</P>
<P>My lady, on hearing him &s;peak, &s;eemed
to be rouzed as if out of a deep &s;leep. Se|veral
of the gentlemen, who had been out
with my ma&s;ter, had come to enquire how
he did; and though &s;ome of them came
into his chamber, my mi&s;tre&s;s did not &s;peak,
nor &s;eem to regard any of them. The fir&s;t
word &s;he uttered was to call me; Patty,
&s;aid &s;he, what is the rea&s;on I do not &s;ee
Mr. Main here? It was my brother, &s;he
meant, who is a &s;urgeon; and I believe,
madam, &s;he has mentioned him to you, as
one that is reckoned pretty &s;kilful in his bu|&s;ine&s;s.
One of the gentlemen immediately
&s;aid, by all means let him be &s;ent for direct|ly.
My brother was &s;oon fetched, and he
thought proper to bleed my ma&s;ter in the
arm. He would not take the dre&s;&s;ings off
his head, as the other &s;urgeon had declared
<PB N="94" REF="95">
the &s;kull was not touched; but &s;aid, he would
be pre&s;ent when the wound was dre&s;&s;ed the
next day; and would watch all night by my
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>My lady was not to be removed from the
bed-&s;ide, nor could we per&s;uade her to take
any &s;u&s;tenance the whole day. My poor
ma&s;ter was in a high fever all night; and
I thought he &s;trove to &s;tifle his groans, that
my lady might not hear them. She did for
all that; and I am &s;ure every one of them
was wor&s;e than a dagger to her heart. She
&s;tole out of the room &s;everal times for a mi|nute,
and I could hear her bur&s;ting into tears,
as &s;oon as &s;he was without &s;ide the door;
then &s;he would come in again, and &s;it by him,
till her heart was again &s;o full, &s;he was for|ced
to go out to give it vent. The whole
night pa&s;&s;ed over in this di&s;mal way.</P>
<P>When my ma&s;ter's head was examined the
next day, my brother found that the &s;kull
was not touched where he had received the
cut, but that it was broken in two other
places, and in &s;o dangerous a way, that it
was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave his life, as it was not
in a part where he could be trapanned. The
other &s;urgeon, who found he had been mi&s;|taken
at fir&s;t, now joined with my brother in
opinion that the world could not &s;ave my ma|&s;ter's
life. Oh! madam, if you had &s;een
my lady when this was declared to her! I
<PB N="95" REF="96">
&s;hall never forget her looks. I remember a
a piece of fine painting at your hou&s;e, which
I u&s;ed to hear your family commend mighti|ly.
It was the picture of de&s;pair. My lady
put me in mind of this piece; &s;he had the
very countenance of it; but I think, if &s;he
had then &s;at to a painter, he could have made
a &s;tronger and more heart-breaking look even
than that picture has.</P>
<P>Such another di&s;mal day and night I be|lieve
never was pa&s;&s;ed in this hou&s;e. My
brother &s;taid with us, though he could do
but little &s;ervice, except to watch my
poor ma&s;ter, for he was between whiles
quite out of his rea&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>No re&s;t did my lady take all la&s;t night. She
could not be got out of the room; &s;he has
ta&s;ted nothing the&s;e two days, nor &s;lept a
wink the&s;e two nights&mdash;She will de&s;troy her|&s;elf
&mdash;What will become of us?&mdash;I have wrote
to my lady Bidulph, to let her know the de|plorable
condition we are all in&mdash;My God!
what will become of the poor children, if my
lady goes on at this rate! She cannot hold out
to be &s;ure, &s;uch a load of &s;orrow at her heart,
without nouri&s;hment or &s;leep&mdash;. Oh! my
good madam, I am not able to go on with
my, ta&s;k&mdash;We have not the lea&s;t hopes in the
world&mdash;My ma&s;ter grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e
every hour: he has his rea&s;on now, and is &s;en|&s;ible
that he is dying. Heaven knows, if I
<PB N="96" REF="97">
could lay down my life to &s;ave his, how glad|ly
I would do it! I &s;hould be no lo&s;s, but he
will be a grievous one&mdash;</P>
<P>Lord help me! I am not able to go on&mdash;I
have writ this by bits and &s;craps&mdash;</P>

<P><DATE>May 16,</DATE> Three o'clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Arnold had been delirious the greate&s;t
part of ye&s;terday; but about &s;ix o'clock in
the evening, having come a little to his &s;en&s;es,
he was con&s;cious that he was going fa&s;t, and
de&s;ired that prayers might be read by him.
His lady &s;ent for the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h,
but he was gone to London: the gentleman
whom he had left to do his duty, was taken
ill the night before, and was not able to leave
his bed. He &s;ent the me&s;&s;enger that went for
him, to another clergyman, who lived about
four miles farther off, to reque&s;t he would at|tend
in his &s;tead; but he was engaged on the
&s;ame duty in his own pari&s;h, and could not
come, he &s;aid, till next morning. The &s;ervant
had wa&s;ted above two hours on this errand; it
was nine o'clock when he returned. Mr.
Arnold during this interval had had &s;everal
ramblings; but was now again a little compo|&s;ed,
though apparently wor&s;e. I whi&s;pered
the apothecary, who ju&s;t then came in, that
he could not live 'till morning. Mrs. Arnold
<PB N="97" REF="98">
ob&s;erved me, and begged to know what I &s;aid.
I told her tenderly, that I feared Mr. Atkins
(that was the clergyman's name) would arrive
too late, if he deferred his vi&s;it till next
day.</P>
<P>She made me no an&s;wer, but &s;eemed to
&s;tudy a little; then went compo&s;edly to Mr.
Arnold's bed-&s;ide. My dear, &s;aid &s;he, Mr.
Downs is unluckily from home; his a&s;&s;i&s;tant
is &s;ick in bed; and we cannot to night get
any other clergyman to vi&s;it you: but as you
are de&s;irous of offering up your prayers to Al|mighty
God, I hope it will not be improper
if I read the &s;ervice for the &s;ick by you. He
&s;treched out his hand towards her, and &s;aid
in a faint, yet eager voice, Do, do, my good
angel! Tears &s;tood in the lady's eyes as &s;he
turned from him; but &s;he quickly wiped them
off, and reque&s;ted of me and the apothecary
to join with her in the &s;olemn office &s;he was
going to perform, which &s;he &s;aid, though &s;he
was &s;en&s;ible it was an irregular act, yet &s;he
hoped, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, would
be accepted in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>She ordered my &s;i&s;ter to fetch her a prayer|book;
and then kneeled down at Mr. Ar|nold's
bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Surely nothing ever appeared &s;o graceful;
her fine hands and her fine eyes lifted up to
heaven, while the book lay open before h$r
on a little table. Such a reverential, &s;uch an
<PB N="98" REF="99">
ardent, yet &s;uch a mournful &s;upplication
in tho&s;e fine eyes! &s;he looked like &s;omething
more than human! After having in this po&s;|ture
offered up a &s;hort petition in &s;ilence, &s;he
began the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Never did I &s;ee true devotion before; the
&s;ervor of her looks, and the tone of her voice
was &s;uch, you would have thought &s;he be|held
her Creator with her bodily eyes. For
my part, I looked on her with &s;uch reve|rence,
that &s;he appeared to me like an angel,
interceding for us poor mortal &s;inners.</P>
<P>She went through the office with admira|ble
&s;trength of mind (omitting the exhortati|on)
'till she came to that part of the prayer,
which &s;ays, &startq;yet for as much, as in all ap|pearance
the time of his di&s;&s;olution draweth
nigh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; Here her voice faultered, and
&s;he &s;topped; but &s;oon recovered her&s;elf, and
proceeded with an unbroken tone to the end.
Every one pre&s;ent wept but her&s;elf, &s;he
thanked us for our kindne&s;s in &s;taying, and
begged we would continue by poor Mr. Ar|nold,
while there was the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of
admini&s;tering any relief to him.</P>
<P>I told her I would mo&s;t willingly obey her
commands, and &s;it up all the night with him,
though it was not in human power to give
him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>She repeated her thanks, and then &s;itting
<PB N="99" REF="100">
down by the bed-&s;ide, remained compo&s;ed
and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock, finding Mr. Arnold
&s;peechle&s;s, I entreated her to retire to her
own chamber, and if &s;he could not &s;leep, to
take &s;ome little refre&s;hment; for &s;he had ta|ken
nothing that whole day, nor for the two
preceding ones, but a di&s;h of tea which my
&s;i&s;ter had forced on her.</P>
<P>Mr. Main, &s;aid &s;he, &s;uffer me to continue
a little longer; my ta&s;k will &s;oon be over. I
was unwilling to urge her; and &s;he remained
&s;itting in her place.</P>
<P>About two o'clock we heard Mr. Arnold
give a deep groan: He is gone, &s;aid &s;he, and
&s;tarted off her chair. I &s;tepped to his bed-&s;ide,
and found indeed he had breathed his
la&s;t. She &s;natched up one of his hands
that lay upon the coverlid of the bed, held
it for near a minute to her lips, and then,
without any audible token of grief, went out
of the room.</P>
<P>I pray God to &s;upport and comfort this ex|cellent
woman.</P>
<Q>[Patty in continuation.]</Q>
<P>Amen! Amen!&mdash;Sure my dear unhappy
lady is enough to break one's heart to lee
her. I was not able to go on, good madam,
and begged of my brother to let down what
<PB N="100" REF="101">
happened, and he has put it in better words
than I could. My lady &s;hut her&s;elf up for
the remainder of the night, and would not
&s;uffer any one to come near her; it is ea&s;y
to gue&s;s how &s;he &s;pent her time: re&s;t, to be
&s;ure, &s;he took none; &s;he could not, if &s;he
had been inclined; for there was no bed in
the chamber where &s;he locked her&s;elf up. In
the morning, a lady, who is our neighbour,
a worthy good woman, came in her own
coach, and took away my lady and the two
children. She neither con&s;ented nor refu&s;ed;
but &s;eemed to let us do what we would with
her; for &s;he &s;aid nothing, but &s;uffered the
lady and me to lead her down &s;tairs, and put
her into the coach. But the &s;ight of the two
children, threw her into &s;uch an agony, that
I thought I &s;hould have died on the &s;pot only
with &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>I have writ again to lady Bidulph: if &s;he
is able, to be &s;ure &s;he will come down; but
I had rather &s;he would &s;end for my lady, for
this is a &s;orrowful place for her to &s;tay in.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 20&mdash;My lady has received a letter
from her mother, de&s;iring her to come to town
directly with the children. She &s;ays &s;he is
not able to come down for her, as her health
is but bad; and my lady V&mdash;has been &s;o
good as to &s;end down her own coach to carry
the little family to town.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
My brother has taken the care of my ma&s;|ter's
funeral upon him&s;elf. He is to be carried
to the family burying place at Arnold Abbey.
As &s;oon as that is over, we mu&s;t try to get
my lady to town; &s;he has no bu&s;ine&s;s to go
into her own lonely hou&s;e again; it would be
enough to kill her.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 30.&mdash;Thank God we have got
back &s;afe to London. My lady keeps up
wonderfully, under the load of grief that &s;he
has at her heart. She does not complain nor
lament her&s;elf, as I have &s;een &s;ome do, who
have not been in half her trouble. She hard|ly
&s;poke a word during her whole journey,
and &s;trove as much as po&s;&s;ible not to cry; but
I could ob&s;erve that &s;he never turned her eyes
on the two little babes, one of whom &s;at in
my lap, and the other be&s;ide me, but the
tears ran down her cheeks.</P>
<P>It was a doleful &s;ight, the meeting between
her and my lady Bidulph. The poor old la|dy
grieves &s;adly, and looks mighty ill: I
am afraid &s;he will not hold out long; &s;he
has had great trials, for a lady &s;o far in years.
Sir George came to &s;ee my lady; he looked
troubled; I hope he will be good to her.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1.&mdash;My lady a&s;ked me this
morning if I had thought of keeping any
journal for this fortnight pa&s;t. I told her I
<PB N="102" REF="103">
had, and &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee it. She &s;hed &s;o
many tears while &s;he read it, that the paper
was quite wet when &s;he gave it to me again.
She ordered me to make up the packet, and
&s;end it off, as &s;he was not in a condition to
add any thing to it her&s;elf.</P>
<Q>[Mrs. Arnold in continuation.]</Q>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20.&mdash;Yes, my dear Cecilia, I have
need of the tender condolements, with which
your la&s;t kind packet was filled. Well may
you call me a child of affliction; I am now
&s;o exerci&s;ed in &s;orrows, that I look forward
to nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Patty, I find, has been a faithful journal|i&s;t;
and has carried down her melancholy
narrative to this day: this day, on which,
for the fir&s;t time, I have taken a pen in my
hand for more than two months; but my eyes
are much better, and I hope I &s;hall not have
occa&s;ion for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her pen, unle&s;s
&s;ome new calamity &s;hould again di&s;qualify me
from u&s;ing my own.</P>
<P>Yet in the midft of my grie&s;s, ought I
not to return thanks to heaven, that I have
&s;uch an a&s;ylum to fly to, as the arms of one
of the be&s;t of mothers? Oh! my dear,
while I have her, I ought not to &s;ay, that I
have lo&s;t every thing. Sir George has been
more obliging &s;ince my fatal lo&s;s than he was
<PB N="103" REF="104">
before; but &s;till there wants that cordial
heart which he formerly had. As for his
lady, I know very little of her. She came
to &s;ee me twice &s;ince my arrival in town, in
all the formal parade of a &s;tate vi&s;it. How
ill does the vanity of pomp &s;uit with a hou&s;e
of mourning! Her vi&s;its were &s;hort, formal,
and cold. She &s;eems to be intolerably proud,
and I thought looked as if &s;he was di&s;gu&s;ted
at vi&s;iting; people in lodgings, who were &s;o
nearly related to her. My brother and &s;he
are to go down this &s;ummer into Scotland, to
&s;ee a nobleman who is her uncle by her mo|ther's
&s;ide. She is ridiculou&s;ly vain of her
family, and has taught Sir George to be &s;o
too; &s;o that now he hardly vouch&s;afes to own
a relation that is untitled.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;, who&s;e friend&s;hip
has been one of the chief re&s;ources of com|fort
to me, went out of town this morning.
She is retired, for life I fear, to a di&s;tant part
of Lanca&s;hire, in order to &s;pend the re&s;t of
her days with her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, a widow lady,
of whom &s;he is very fond. Her &s;on's ill be|haviour
has di&s;gu&s;ted her &s;o, &s;he has broke
with him intirely. Her younger &s;on is gone
into the army, not, I find, with her appro|bation:
and &s;he told me, &s;he has nothing
now worth living for, at lea&s;t nothing for
which &s;he &s;hould &s;ubject her&s;elf to the cares
<PB N="104" REF="105">
of life. She in&s;i&s;ted on my corre&s;ponding
with her; and renewed her a&s;&s;urances of
that kind attachment, which 1 have already
&s;o &s;trongly experienced.</P>
<P>At another time the lo&s;s of this dear wo|man's
&s;ociety would have affected me more
&s;en&s;ibly; but I am &s;o inured to di&s;appoint|ment
and grief, that I am almo&s;t become a
&s;toic.</P>
<P>Patty has already informed you, that Mi&s;s
Burchell is often with us; &s;he is more &s;ollici|tous,
more a&s;&s;iduous than ever in her atten|dance
on my mother. I find &s;he even
&s;at up with her two nights, on an illne&s;s
which &s;eized her on her fir&s;t hearing the news
of my misfortune. Poor girl! My mother
tells me &s;he went &s;o far as to expre&s;s her ap|prehen&s;ions
on my being again &s;ingle; but
my mother quieted her fears on that head
(not without a &s;oft reprimand for her doubt|ing),
by putting her in mind, that be&s;ides
the circum&s;tances not being altered in regard
to her, &s;he had received my &s;olemn promi&s;e,
that, whenever it was in my power, I would
u&s;e my whole influence (whatever that might
be) in her favour. I did make her &s;uch a
promi&s;e, and &s;hall fulfil it to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland's ab&s;ence from the king|dom,
hitherto put it out of my power; nor

he lived, fully re&s;tored as I was to his con|fidence
and good opinion, I &s;hould have
ventured to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret to
him, and got him to join with me in
&s;uch mea&s;ures, as I &s;hould have thought
be&s;t for Mi&s;s Burchell's happine&s;s. It now
re&s;ts upon my&s;elf alone, and I will leave
nothing unattempted to &s;erve her.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22&mdash;You will be &s;urprized
perhaps, my Cecilia, when I tell you that
Mr. Faulkland is now in England. Mi&s;s
Burchell told me &s;o this day. She men|tioned
it in a carele&s;s manner, rather di|recting
her di&s;cour&s;e to my mother. She
had too much delicacy to hint at con&s;e|quences
of any kind from this circum&s;tance,
and quickly turned from the &s;ubject. My
mother a&s;ked her impatiently, when he
came; where he was; and &s;everal other
que&s;tions; to none of which &s;he could give
any an&s;wer, but that &s;he heard he had
been returned above three months, and
was at his &s;eat in Hertford&s;hire. I am
&s;urprized Sir George never mentioned this
to me: to be &s;ure he knew it; he is
not extremely nice in his notions; how|ever
this is a decorum for which I am
obliged to him. Lady V&mdash;doubtle&s;s
was ignorant of it, or &s;he would have told
me.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107">
There is nothing now to prevent me
from warmly interfering for Mi&s;s Burchell.
Charming young woman! how is &s;he to
be pitied! The tedious years of &s;u&s;pence,
of almo&s;t hopele&s;s love, that &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed,
de&s;erve a recompence; and her little boy,
my mother tells me, is a lovely creature.
Mi&s;s Burchell brought him once to &s;ee my
mother; Mr. Faulkland's former hou&s;e|keeper
vi&s;its the child often, and has
brought his mother frequent and large &s;up|plies
for his u&s;e.</P>
<P>I told Mi&s;s Burchell, at parting to-day,
that I had not forgot my promi&s;e; and
that, as &s;oon as decency would per|mit,
nothing &s;hould hinder me from being
a mo&s;t &s;trenuous advocate for her. She
&s;queezed my hand, and whi&s;pered, dear
madam, my fate is in your power!</P>
<P>I would it were, then &s;hould &s;he &s;oon
be happy. But I will acquit my&s;elf as far as
I am able.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22.&mdash;I was prevailed on to
dine at my brother's to-day, the fir&s;t time
that I have been abroad ever &s;ince I came
to town: I had no mind to go; but my
mother, not being well, had excu&s;ed her|&s;elf;
and &s;he &s;aid, it would be taken ami&s;s
if I did &s;o too, lady Sarah her&s;elf having
made the invitation. Her lady&s;hip &s;aid, I
<PB N="107" REF="108">
need not be fearful of meeting &s;trangers
at her hou&s;e, as it was to be a private day.
So much the better thought I; nothing el&s;e
&s;hould induce me to go.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t time I ever was in Sir
George's hou&s;e, which is a very magni|ficent
one, within a door or two of Mr.
Faulkland's, in St. James's-Square, as lady
Sarah did not approve of that which he
had before. But, my dear, the o&s;tentation
of this woman made me &s;ick; &s;uch a pa|rade
of grandeur, &s;uch an unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;|play
of &s;tate and &s;plendor, I thought, looked
like an in&s;ult upon me. I was carried
into a mo&s;t &s;umptuous drawing-room; but
as this was a private day, as &s;he called it,
the furniture was all covered up with bo|dy-cloths;
and the room, having been newly
wa&s;hed, felt extremely cold.</P>
<P>I was told her lady&s;hip was dre&s;&s;ing,
though it was then, as I imagined, her
dinner-time. After I had &s;hivered here for
about half an hour, lady Sarah's woman
came to de&s;ire me to walk up &s;tairs. As
the woman did not know me, and, from
the little ceremony &s;he &s;aw me treated
with, concluded I was &s;ome humble vi&s;i|tor,
&s;he took me up the back &s;tairs to her
lady's dre&s;&s;ing room, where I found lady
Sarah, who was not yet half dre&s;&s;ed, in
con&s;ultation with her millener. The wo|man
<PB N="108" REF="109">
man was trying &s;ome head-dre&s;&s;es on her
before the gla&s;s. She made me a very &s;light
apology for having kept me waiting &s;o
long; and, to mend the matter, told me,
as &s;he was not near ready, if I cho&s;e look|ing
at the hou&s;e, I &s;hould have time enough
to do it before dinner. I thanked her; but
&s;aid, I had already &s;at &s;o long in the cold,
that I felt my&s;elf chilled; and with her la|dy&s;hip's
permi&s;&s;ion, would place my&s;elf at
her fire-&s;ide till dinner was ready. She a&s;k|ed
her woman, carele&s;ly, why I had not
been &s;hewn into the dining-parlour. She
then turned to her millener again, to whom
&s;he gave a particular charge to have a
&s;uit of very rich point, which &s;he had fixed
on, done up for her again&s;t the next night;
by which I found my &s;i&s;ter was going to
throw off her mourning intirely; that which
&s;he had on being &s;o &s;light, that it was &s;carcely
to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;uch.</P>
<P>My brother entered the room while &s;he
was thus employed; and having &s;aluted me,
looked at his watch, and a&s;ked lady Sarah,
had &s;he ordered dinner later than u&s;ual?
She told him, &s;he had ordered it half an
hour later than ordinary, as &s;he had a mind
to make a long morning, having dedicated
it to trades-people, with whom &s;he had a
hundred things to &s;ettle. My brother ca&s;t
a &s;ide-glance at me: I thought he looked
<PB N="109" REF="110">
a little aba&s;hed at the impertinence and ill-breeding
of his wife.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah had by this time huddled on
her cloaths: a laced footman appeared at
the door, who &s;ummoned us by a &s;ilent
bow, to dinner.</P>
<P>The millener gathered up her frippery,
and put them into a band-box; telling her,
&s;he would wait on her lady&s;hip again. Lady
Sarah an&s;wered, You have a mon&s;trous way
to go, Mrs.&mdash;(I forget the name);
and, as I have not half done with you yet,
you may &s;tay and dine here, as we are
alone, and I will look over the re&s;t of the
things in the evening, as I &s;hall not have
another lei&s;ure day while I am in town.</P>
<P>This was going a little too far: Sir
George felt it. I believe, lady Sarah, &s;aid
he, this gentlewoman has a coach waiting
for her at the door (he had &s;een it, for
he was but ju&s;t come in); perhaps it may
be inconvenient to detain her: &s;he may
leave the things, and call another time.
The woman took the hint, though &s;he
before &s;eemed inclined to accept of the ho|nour
lady Sarah had done her. She made
her court'&s;ey, and withdrew. As this, how|ever,
had brought on a variety of fre&s;h
in&s;tructions, it detained us &s;o long, that
the dinner was quite cold; nor was our
repa&s;t, had it even been warm, by any
<PB N="110" REF="111">
means an&s;werable to the elegance of the
&s;ervice, the &s;uperb &s;ideboard, and the num|ber
of attendants. In &s;hort, the dinner was
compo&s;ed of a parcel of to&s;&s;ed-up di&s;hes,
that looked like the fragments of a fea&s;t.
You know there is nobody more indiffe|rent
to the plea&s;ures of the table than I
am; yet I own that this, joined to the re&s;t
of this fooli&s;h woman's behaviour, nettled
me extremely. There was &s;uch a mixture
of &s;ordidne&s;s and vanity in the whole ap|paratus,
as made it truly contemptible.</P>
<P>I made ha&s;te to put an end to my vi|&s;it,
as &s;oon as I po&s;&s;ibly could after din|ner,
with a re&s;olution never to repeat it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few &s;ketches of lady Sarah,
you may form &s;ome kind of an idea of
what &s;ort of a creature it is. I &s;hould pity
Sir George, but that I think her di&s;po&s;i|tion
is not extremely oppo&s;ite to his own.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 24.&mdash;I am told that the widow
Arnold is actually married to that vile at|torney
who was the contriver, and more
than partner, in her iniquity. I am really
glad &s;he has lo&s;t the name of a family
to which &s;he was a di&s;grace. Every body
now believes that I and my children have
been greatly injured; but how unavailing
is compa&s;&s;ion; it only mortifies, when it
is expre&s;&s;ed by the pitying words and looks
<PB N="111" REF="112">
of people, who have it neither in their
power nor inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. This
Mrs. Arnold, bad as &s;he is, is vi&s;ited and
care&s;&s;ed. Favour always follows the for|tunate.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 25.&mdash;This day Sir George and
his lady &s;et out for Scotland. He came to
take his leave of us; but made an apo|logy
for lady Sarah, who&s;e hurry would
not permit her to call on us. My bro|ther
&s;ays, they &s;hall &s;tay &s;ome months at
her uncle$s, Lord K&mdash;. He told me,
at parting, he &s;hould write to me as &s;oon
as he got to his journey's end, having
&s;omething very particular to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7.&mdash;I have read over my journal
of the la&s;t fortnight, and am &s;tartled to
think what a poor in&s;ignificant being I am!
Not a &s;ingle act worth recording, even to
<HI>you.</HI> My whole life perhaps may have
pa&s;&s;ed &s;o; yet one is apt to fancy, that
they are doing &s;omething of importance,
while they are engaged in the little bu&s;tle
of the world, be it in ever &s;o trifling a
manner; and when you find you have a
variety of incidents to relate, in which you
your&s;elf were concerned, that your time
has not been &s;pent in vain. But for the&s;e
la&s;t fourteen days, had I kept a journal
<PB N="112" REF="113">
for my cat, I think I &s;hould have had as
much to &s;ay for her.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8.&mdash;I &s;hall grow bu&s;y again: I
have received the promi&s;ed letter from Sir
George; an extraordinary one it is: but I
will not anticipate the contents; read them
your&s;elf.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Dear Sidney, <DATE>July 4, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I have a &s;erious &s;ubject to offer to your
con&s;ideration, which made me the rather
chu&s;e to engage your attention in this man|ner,
than in a conver&s;ation between our|&s;elves;
liable as that would be to inter|ruptions,
objections, and frivolous puncti|lios,
from which you have already &s;uffered
&s;o &s;everely.</P>
<P>I have paid &s;o much regard to that de|corum
of which you are &s;o fond, as ne|ver
to have mentioned Mr. Faulkland's
name to you &s;ince you were become a widow,
though it is near four months &s;ince he re|turned
to England.</P>
<P>As I kept up a corre&s;pondence with him
when he was abroad, you may be &s;ure I
informed him of your reconciliation to your
late hu&s;band; a reconciliation, which, if
you thought it a happine&s;s to you, you were
indebted to Faulkland for. This &s;ingle
circum&s;tance it was that inclined him to
<PB N="113" REF="114">
return to England, which otherwi&s;e perhaps
he would never again have &s;een, though the
nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs here, which he had
left at random, required his pre&s;ence. To
avoid giving umbrage to your hu&s;band, he
repaired privately to his hou&s;e in the country,
where I paid him a vi&s;it. Few of his friends,
except my&s;elf, knew of his being in the king|dom.</P>
<P>Remember, Sidney, the great obligations
you have to Mr. Faulkland, and let that
prepare your mind for what I am going to
&s;ay.</P>
<P>You are now become a free woman:
Faulkland loves you &s;till, with an unparal|lel'd
affection. I had a letter from him
&s;oon after your arrival in town, wherein he
mentions the revival of his hopes from your
pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and intreats me to be
mindful of his intere&s;t. He charged me,
however, not to mention his name to you,
till a decent time was pa&s;&s;ed; otherwi&s;e
probably you would have been acquainted
with the&s;e particulars &s;ooner: but Faulk|land
him&s;elf has a little too much of that
ridiculous nicety which you admire &s;o. I
think I have waited till a <HI>very</HI> decent time,
as you have now been almo&s;t three months
a widow.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
I have very little rea&s;on to imagine that
<HI>my</HI> influence, on this occa&s;ion will have any
weight either with you or my mother: I
have had proofs of this already; but I hope
you will not be &s;o blind to your own intere&s;t,
as to refu&s;e the good that fortune once more
throws at your feet. I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e
you &s;o weak, as to let the ab&s;urd objection,
which formerly prevented your happine&s;s,
&s;till prevail with you to reject the &s;ame hap|pine&s;s,
&s;o unexpectedly again offered to your
acceptance.</P>
<P>My mother and you have by this time
learnt how how to forgive <HI>human frailties.</HI>
Indeed you forgave &s;uch enormities, that
Faulkland's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in compari&s;on of
them, was innocence. But I will not re|proach
the memory of the dead.</P>
<P>Whatever pretence you might formerly
have had to carry your punctilios to an ex|traordinary
height, certain circum&s;tances in
your life have now made your &s;ituation very
different. You are de&s;titute of fortune, in|cumbered
with children. Reflect on this,
and let your own imagination &s;upply the
re&s;t. To any body but your&s;elf, I &s;hould
think all that I have &s;aid needle&s;s; but
I know the minds that I have to deal
with.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take this opportunity of telling you,
that I am &s;urprized at my mother's continued
<PB N="115" REF="116">
attachment to Mi&s;s Burchell; &s;he is an art|ful
creature, and, I think, by no means a
proper acquaintance for you. I am far from
wi&s;hing to injure her; but &s;uch an intimacy
may be dangerous.</P>
<P>You will certainly hear from Faulkland
before it be long. I repeat it again, You
owe him more than ever you will be able to
repay: the recompence he de&s;ires will en&s;ure
your own happine&s;s and pro&s;perity: your
gratitude, as well as your prudence, will now
be put to the te&s;t, and your conduct, on
this occa&s;ion, will determine me as to the
light in which I &s;hall henceforth con&s;ider
you.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ent my duty to my mother. Lady Sa|rah
de&s;ires her &s;ervice may be accepted.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a letter is this, my &s;i&s;ter! But
Sir George is &s;till him&s;elf; gro&s;s; void of
&s;entiment: he dreams of nothing but the
glaring advantages that fortune and rank
in life procure. And how he argues too!
Weak arguer! He <HI>will not &s;uppo&s;e that the
objection</HI> $ab&s;urd he calls it), <HI>which formerly
prevented my happine&s;s, &s;hould &s;till prevail
with me to reject the &s;ame happine&s;s</HI>&mdash;Why
not? Is the nature of Mr. Faulkland's of|fence
changed? Has he ever repaired it?
<PB N="116" REF="117">
Has not mi&s;s Burchell the &s;ame claim &s;he
ever had? Nay, a &s;tronger than ever, if
years of unabated love can give it her? <HI>My
mother and I have by this time learnt to forgive
human frailties; nay, we forgave enormities</HI>&mdash;
Unkind brother, to rake up the unfortunate
a&s;hes of my beloved. We have, indeed,
learnt to forgive human frailties; but they
were the frailties of a hu&s;band, a repenting
hu&s;band, who was &s;educed to the commi&s;&s;ion
of tho&s;e crimes which he abhorred: but &s;ure|ly
that is no plea for my overlooking the
faults of another, to whom I am under no &s;uch
tie. I am now <HI>without fortune and incumbred
with children.</HI> Indelicate man! does he think
<HI>that</HI> an argument in favour of his propo&s;al?
It is a &s;trong one again&s;t it. Shall I, who,
when I was in the virgin-bloom of youth,
flattered with &s;ome advantages of per&s;on,
which time and grief have &s;ince impaired,
and not de&s;titute of fortune; I, who then re|jected
Mr. Faulkland from motives which
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t; &s;hall I, now that I have lo&s;t tho&s;e
advantages, meanly conde&s;cend to accept of
this rejected man? This would, indeed, be
acknowleging, that the humiliating change
had levelled me to tho&s;e principles which I
formerly contemned; would lay me under
mortifying obligations to Mr. Faulkland, and
de&s;troy the merit of that refu&s;al which pro|ceeded
from &s;uch ju&s;tifiable motives.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
No, my &s;ordid brother! if I <HI>could</HI> recom|pence
Mr. Faulkland as he de&s;erves at my
hands, I <HI>would</HI> do it; but, with &s;uch a mind
as I bear, it cannot be done your way. I &s;ay
nothing of the promi&s;e I made mi&s;s Burchell;
if I had never made her &s;uch, my &s;entiments
would be the &s;ame from tho&s;e other con&s;ide|rations;
but &s;uch a promi&s;e, binding as it is,
determines my conduct beyond the po&s;&s;ibility
of a doubt.</P>
<P>How unrea&s;onable are Sir George's preju|dices
with regard to this unhappy young
creature! He is for ever throwing out &s;ome
invective again&s;t her. It is cruel; but I am
tempted to forgive him, as I know it pro|ceeds
from his attachment to his friend. He
need not put me in mind of the gratitude I
owe Mr. Faulkland; I am thoroughly &s;en&s;i|ble
of it; but Sir George and I differ widely
in our ideas of expre&s;&s;ing this gratitude. My
<HI>conduct in this affair is to determine him as to
the light in which he is hereafter to con&s;ider me.</HI>
Why, be it &s;o. He has long lo&s;t the tender|ne&s;s
of a brother for me; I will not regain it
at the expence of my honour. I know the
wor&s;t that can befall me is poverty. I have
already experienced almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible ill
in life but that, and for that I am prepared.
But I will not call my&s;elf poor while I have
an upright heart to &s;upport me; and the
means, poor and de&s;picable as they are, of
<PB N="118" REF="119">
&s;u&s;taining life. But what do I call de&s;pica|ble?
Have I not an e&s;tate, my dear, a whole
fifty pounds a year, that I can call my own?
This much was re&s;erved to me out of my
jointure when the re&s;t was &s;old; and on this,
whenever it plea&s;es heaven to take my mother
away, will I retire to &s;ome cottage in a cheap
country, where my two children and I will
live, and &s;mile at the rich and the great.</P>
<P>My brother's letter has vexed and di&s;gu&s;t|ed
me exceedingly. <HI>Lady Sarah pre&s;ents her
&s;ervice.</HI> Vain woman! is that a becoming
phra&s;e to the mother of her hu&s;band? I am
&s;o provoked I think I &s;hall not an&s;wer him:
he has no reli&s;h for &s;uch arguments as I could
produce in &s;upport of my own opinions, and
my writing to him would only bring on di&s;|agreeable
altercations. My mother is in a
downright pa&s;&s;ion with him: Selfi&s;h wretch!
&s;he called him; and &s;aid, he would &s;acrifice
both honour and ju&s;tice to his own pride.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 19.&mdash;Mi&s;s Burchell; poor &s;oul, how
I pity her! Her anxiety increa&s;es every hour.
She, you may be &s;ure, keeps a look-out on
all Mr. Faulkland's motions; for, &s;he tells
me, &s;he hears he is arrived in town. I &s;up|po&s;e
I &s;hall receive a notice of &s;ome kind or
other from him. The unhappy girl; &s;he
grieves me to &s;ee her! There never was &s;o
extravagant a love as her's: &s;he has nouri&s;hed
<PB N="119" REF="120">
it in &s;olitude, and I believe has a heart natu|rally
tender to an uncommon degree; other|wi&s;e
&s;he could not, for &s;o long a time, and
with &s;o little hopes, have pre&s;erved &s;o undi|mini&s;hed
a fondne&s;s; but &s;ome accidents
have, I know not how, combined to feed
this flame. She acknowledges that Mr.
Faulkland's being di&s;appointed in e&s;pou&s;ing
me, gave the fir&s;t encouragement to her
hopes; for, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had rea&s;on to be|lieve
that I was the only woman in the world
that &s;tood between her and her happine&s;s;
and Mr. Faulkland's remaining &s;ingle ever
&s;ince confirmed her in that opinion. Then
the generous attention that he paid to her
welfare, in recommending her to my mo|ther's
notice, when he fir&s;t left England;
the noble &s;upplies that he con&s;tantly furni&s;h|ed
her with, ever &s;ince, for the child's u&s;e;
his behaviour to Mr. Gerrarde, who, &s;he
&s;ays, is the mo&s;t en&s;naring of creatures; the
tender manner that he mentioned her in his
letter to my brother; my mother's con&s;tant|ly
indulging her in the belief that &s;he would
one day recover Mr. Faulkland's affections:
all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, joined toge|ther,
have kept alive the warme&s;t and mo&s;t
romantic love I ever &s;aw or heard of. Well
may the men &s;ay, that for&s;aken women are
always the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lovers: it may
be &s;o, and Mi&s;s Burchell is one in&s;tance of
<PB N="120" REF="121">
the truth of this ob&s;ervation; but I think I
&s;hould never make another. There is &s;ome|thing
to me unaccountable in this; but Mi&s;s
Burchell is all made up of langui&s;hments
and &s;oftne&s;s. I have beard her &s;peak of Mr.
Faulkland in &s;o rapturous a &s;train as has
amazed me; and &s;he once owned to me,
that &s;he is &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t have died, if he
had not returned her love. Return it! Ah!
my Cecilia, how did he return it? How
mortifying is her &s;ituation! to be compelled
to court the man who flies her, and to make

me with importunities to write to Mr.
Faulkland, now he is come to town; but I
be&s;eeched her to have a little patience, till
&s;ome overture was fir&s;t made by him toward
a renewal of our acquaintance, which, I
told her, it was very probable I &s;hould &s;oon

to let her know of the intimation I had from

with compliments and how-do-ye's, to my

lives with us, was pre&s;ent when I re|ceived
it: her colour came and went &s;e|veral
times while our &s;ervant delivered his

<P><HI>July</HI> 21.&mdash;I wrote to Mr. Faulkland
la&s;t night: my mother approved of the
letter, which I &s;hewed her before I &s;ent

was left at his hou&s;e; but as I received
an an&s;wer to it early this morning, I will
give you copies of the two letters, toge|ther;
and fir&s;t that of mine to Mr. Faulk|land.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, thank you from my
heart, for your friend&s;hip, and beg you
will not think me ungrateful for having
thus long deferred to pay you my acknow|ledgments
for the &s;ignal favours I have
received at your hands. I am &s;en&s;ible,
Sir, that it was owing to your compa&s;&s;ion,
your genero&s;ity, and di&s;intere&s;ted noblene&s;s
of mind, that I was once indebted for the
<PB N="124" REF="125">
greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of my life. To you I
owe the vindicating of my &s;u&s;pected faith,
and the being re&s;tored to the affection of
my dear hu&s;band. For this goodne&s;s I
have never cea&s;ed to ble&s;s and pray for
you, and &s;hall continue to do &s;o while I
live. But oh! Sir, while you have given
<HI>me</HI> &s;o much cau&s;e for gratitude and e&s;teem,
why will you leave one heart to &s;igh for
your unkindne&s;s? a heart that admires,
that loves, that adores you! a heart wor|thy
of your acceptance, and which has
a right to demand all your tenderne&s;s.
Need I name the amiable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of this
heart? I need not; there is but one wo|man
in the world who owns this de&s;crip|tion:
for her let me become an advocate;
&s;he has won me to her party: indeed, Sir,
&s;he, and &s;he only, de&s;erves your love.
Her's, I am &s;ure, you have ever po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
unrivalled, though her youth, her
beauty, and charming accompli&s;hments,
mu&s;t have made her the object of every
one's wi&s;hes who &s;aw her. 'Tis above
four years &s;ince you fir&s;t won her virgin
affections. What has been her portion
&s;ince that fatal time? Tears, &s;olitude,
and unremitting angui&s;h. How can a
mind like yours, &s;u&s;ceptible as it is of pity
for the woes of others condemn <HI>&s;uch</HI> a
woman to perpetual &s;orrow? How can
<PB N="125" REF="126">
that genero&s;ity, which has been &s;o active
on other occa&s;ions, droop and langui&s;h
where there is <HI>&s;uch</HI> a cau&s;e to call forth
all its exertions?.</P>
<P>Do, Mr. Faulkland, permit pity to
plead in your bo&s;om for the dear Mi&s;s
Burchell. I &s;hould urge paternal affection
too; but to the voice of nature you can|not
be deaf. Your &s;weet little &s;on calls
upon you to do him and his mother ju&s;|tice;
the injured lady her&s;elf implores your
compa&s;&s;ion; my mother, who equally ad|mires
and loves her, intreats you; I,
whom you once e&s;teemed, conjure you;
the &s;ecret monitor in your own &s;oul mu&s;t
join in our &s;ollicitations. Why then,
why will you &s;hut your ears again&s;t the
united voice of rea&s;on, of con&s;cience, and
of gratitude? You cannot, you will not
do it. Mi&s;s Burchell's merit and &s;uffer|ings
mu&s;t be rewarded; and I &s;hall ble&s;s
Mr. Faulkland as the guardian of the in|jured,
the patron of the afflicted, the a&s;|&s;ertor
of his own, as well as of my ho|nour.
This is the light, and this only, in

<OPENER>Mr. FAULKLAND's An&s;wer.</OPENER>
<P>You do well, Madam, you do well to
anticipate my &s;uit; and, with &s;o much
cruel eloquence, to bid me de&s;pair. Yes,
I &s;ee Mi&s;s Burchell has won you to her
party; but what have I done to merit &s;uch
a malevolent fate, that <HI>you,</HI> you of all
created beings, &s;hould become <HI>her</HI> advo|cate?
I little thought Mrs. Arnold would
make &s;uch a barbarous u&s;e of her power.
Tell me, thou dear tyrant, how have I
de&s;erved this? Would it not have been
kinder to have &s;aid at once, Faulkland, do
not hope; I never will be yours; I hate,
I de&s;pi&s;e you, and leave you to your fate?
Oh! no; you are artful in your cruelty;
you would prevent even my wi&s;hes, and
cut off my hopes in their blo&s;&s;om, before
they dare to unfold them&s;elves to you.</P>
<P>But you have furni&s;hed me with wea|pons
again&s;t your&s;elf, and I will u&s;e them
with as little mercy as you have &s;hewn
to me. If four years are pa&s;t &s;ince I
won Mi&s;s Burchell's affections, is it not
al&s;o <HI>as</HI> long that I have loved you with an
ardor&mdash;Oh thou in&s;en&s;ible! Were you
not mine by your own con&s;ent, with your
mother's approbation? Was not the day,
the hour fixed, that I was to have led
<PB N="127" REF="128">
you to the altar? Mi&s;s Burchell's hopes
were never rai&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch as
mine, when an avenging fiend &s;natched
the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing from my gra&s;p.
Think what were then my &s;ufferings. I
&s;aw you afterwards in the arms of ano|ther.
Mi&s;s Burchell never &s;uffered <HI>&s;uch</HI>
torture. Had I &s;een you <HI>happy,</HI> I might
have been con&s;oled. If Mi&s;s Burchell
loved me as I have loved you, &s;he would
rejoice in the pro&s;pect of my felicity. I
&s;hould have done &s;o in your's, Heaven is
my witne&s;s! Had you been happy, I
&s;hould not have thought my&s;elf mi&s;erable,
though you were lo&s;t to my hopes.</P>
<P>Why do you compel me to urge an
ungrateful truth in regard to Mi&s;s Bur|chell?
Madam, &s;he has no claim to my
vows: my gratitude, my compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he
has an ample right to, and &s;he has them.
More might by this time have been her's,
if I had never &s;een Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>Remember, I do not yet de&s;ire permi&s;&s;ion
to throw my&s;elf at your feet; I revere you
too much to make &s;uch a reque&s;t; but
do not bani&s;h me your pre&s;ence. I can|not
always be proof again&s;t &s;uch rigours.
Indulge me at lea&s;t in the hope that time
may do &s;omething in my favour. I will
not de&s;ire you to tell me &s;o; but do not
forbid it. Lady Bidulph knows I re&s;pect
<PB N="128" REF="129">

<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>How this man di&s;tre&s;&s;es me, my dear!
What a difficult talk have I undertaken!
yet I will go through with it. I am
fearful of letting Mi&s;s Burchell &s;ee his
an&s;wer, &s;o di&s;couraging as it is for her;
yet how can I withold it from her &s;ight?
'Tis nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould conceal nothing
from her on this occa&s;ion; &s;he confides
in me, and I mu&s;t not give her cau&s;e for
&s;u&s;picion. <HI>She has no right to his vows.</HI>
This he always &s;aid. It is nece&s;&s;ary the
lady &s;hould be quite explicit with me. I
doubt &s;he has not been altogether &s;incere
in what &s;he has &s;aid to my mother on this
&s;ubject. I &s;hall &s;ee her pre&s;ently, and
di&s;cour&s;e with her more particularly on
this head than I have ever yet done.&hellip;</P>
<P>I have had a conference with Mi&s;s
Burchell, a long one, and in private;
for I told my mother I wi&s;hed to talk
with her alone.</P>
<P>I began with &s;hewing her Mr. Faulk|land's
la&s;t letter. It had the effect I ex|pected.
She was exceedingly &s;hocked. I
laid my finger on that paragraph, <HI>She
<PB N="129" REF="130">
has no right to my vows.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary,
my dear madam, &s;aid I, that you &s;hould
be perfectly open and candid with me on
this head. I have entered the li&s;ts for
you, and will not give, up your cau&s;e; but
it depends on you to furni&s;h me with
every po&s;&s;ible argument in your favour.
If you mi&s;lead me by wrong in&s;inuations,
in&s;tead of putting it in my power to &s;erve
you, you will only create to your&s;elf fre&s;h
ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>It is a nice &s;ubject, madam, and what
I have ever been cautious of touching
upon to you; but in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation
of your affairs, it is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance
to you, that you &s;hould have no
re&s;erves to me. When Mr. Faulkland fir&s;t
recommended you to my mother's ac|quaintance,
he referred her to your ho|nour,
for an explanation of certain points,
of &s;o delicate a nature, that I am loath
to touch upon them. But pardon me,
dear Mi&s;s Burchell, you mu&s;t be open
with me. Mr. Faulkland was obliged to
declare, in his own ju&s;tification, that he
never &s;ought to gain your affections; and
was &s;o far from endeavouring to take ad|vantage
of the kind &s;entiments you had
for him, that he avoided all opportunities
of improving them; that he was even
&s;urprized into the fatal &s;tep, which has
<PB N="130" REF="131">
&s;ince made you &s;o unhappy, by the arti|fices
of that vile woman, who had the care
of you.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland relied &s;o entirely on
your candour, that, as I told you before,
he referred my mother to you, for a con|firmation
of the truth of what he ad|vanced;
imagining that your te&s;timony
would in &s;ome mea&s;ure extenuate his
fault. My mother, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve,
has heard the &s;tory from you in a
light le&s;s favourable to Mr. Faulkland.
I was married before &s;he received any in|formation
on this &s;ubject from you; and
as any extenuation on Mr. Faulkland's
&s;ide was then become a matter of indif|ference
to me, I enquired not into par|ticulars;
but by what I could judge from
my mother's di&s;cour&s;e then, and from
hints which &s;he has many times dropped
&s;ince, I am inclined to believe, that either
Mr. Faulkland concealed &s;ome particu|lars,
or that you, from a delicacy very
natural to a young lady in &s;uch circum|&s;tances,
cho&s;e to draw a veil over &s;ome
parts of your &s;tory. But, dear madam,
all di&s;gui&s;es mu&s;t now be thrown a&s;ide;
depend upon it, your candour will more
effectually recommend you to Mr. Faulk|land's
e&s;teem, than any thing el&s;e; and,
<PB N="131" REF="132">
perhaps, your ju&s;tifying him to <HI>me,</HI> may
be no immaterial circum&s;tance in your
favour.</P>
<P>Variety of pa&s;&s;ions di&s;covered them|&s;elves
on her face while I &s;poke, but
&s;hame was predominant. She was mute,
and hung down her head. I took her by
the hand, Do not think, my dear, I mean
to en&s;nare you; far be &s;uch perfidy from
my heart! Have I not promi&s;ed you my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance? I declare, by every thing that
is &s;acred, you &s;hall have it to the utmo&s;t
&s;tretch of my power; but do not let a
fal&s;e ba&s;hfulne&s;s &s;tand between you and
&s;incerity; you will &s;top up the way to your
own happine&s;s if you do. Speak, dear
madam, has Mr. Faulkland been ju&s;t in
his repre&s;entations?</P>
<P>She bur&s;t into a flood of tears: Oh!
madam, you read my very &s;oul; what
di&s;gui&s;e can I make u&s;e of, before &s;uch
penetrating eyes as yours? Yes, Mr.
Faulkland <HI>has</HI> &s;poke the truth, &s;hameful
as the confe&s;&s;ion is for me, I own it.
Mrs. Gerrarde, ba&s;e woman! betrayed
me; my own mad pa&s;&s;ion did the re&s;t.
Mr. Faulkland told me, a few days after
the fatal evening, that he was the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable man on earth for what had
happened: he &s;aid there was a lady in
the world to whom he was bound to of|fer
<PB N="132" REF="133">
his hand; that her brother was his
particular friend; that his marriage was
then actually negotiating; and he was
pre&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion to return to
London. He owned he had never &s;een
the lady, but as his honour was engaged
to her brother he could not look upon
him&s;elf as a free man. He cur&s;ed his ill
fate, that he had not an opportunity of
informing me of this &s;ooner; which, he
&s;aid, might have prevented me from ca&s;t|ing
away my affection on a man, who
could not de&s;erve it. What could I &s;ay,
madam? There was no room for re|proaches
or complaints. I made none; I
had nobody to accu&s;e but my&s;elf. I had
declared my frantic love to Mr. Faulk|land
una&s;ked; I had implored his in re|turn:
in one dreadful moment I fell a &s;a|crifice
to my own weakne&s;s. The only
hope that now remained for me, was
built on that circum&s;tance of Mr. Faulk|land's
having never &s;een his de&s;tined bride.
Had I known you, madam, to have been
the per&s;on, there could have &s;prung but
&s;mall comfort from that con&s;ideration;
but ignorant as I was of the lady's merit,
I thought it not impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;ome
objection might have ari&s;en either to her
per&s;on or temper; or the lady, perhaps,
(though that I thought almo&s;t incredible)
<PB N="133" REF="134">
might not approve of Mr. Faulkland:
in either ca&s;e, &s;ome glimmerings of hope
remained for me. Mr. Faulkland's ge|nerous
compa&s;&s;ion for me, gave me room
to think he did not hate me, and I was
unwilling to lo&s;e the little intere&s;t I
thought I had gained in his heart, by
<HI>fond complainings,</HI> much le&s;s upbraidings,
for which he had given me no cau&s;e. I
therefore acquie&s;ced, determined to wait
for what my fate was to do with me; re|&s;olving
privately in my own mind, that
in ca&s;e Mr. Faulkland's intended nupti|als
&s;hould not take place, to remind him
of my love. I did not confe&s;s to my
aunt what had been the re&s;ult of that in|terview,
which &s;he had contrived between
Mr. Faulkland and me: &s;hame would
not &s;uffer me to divulge it. But it was
not long in my power to conceal it: I
believe indeed, &s;he &s;u&s;pected it before.
She reproached me for the error which
&s;he her&s;elf had cau&s;ed; but I believe, what
mo&s;t nettled her was Mr. Faulkland's
having e&s;caped the &s;nare; for I am &s;ure
&s;he would have been ba&s;e enough to have
had me retain him as a lover, though I
could not &s;ecure him for a hu&s;band; for
he was not the fir&s;t, that this bad woman
would have &s;educed me to favour, for
her own private intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135">
In the mid&s;t of the horror, into which
the condition I found my&s;elf in threw me,
I heard that Mr. Faulkland was on the
point of being married.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect I had before me drove
me to de&s;pair. I knew I could not re|main
long in my uncle's hou&s;e. I knew
not whither to fly. In my di&s;traction I
wrote to Mr. Faulkland: You, madam,
&s;aw the letter, that ill-fated letter, which
deprived Mr. Faulkland of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;oon received an an&s;wer, wherein
Mr. Faulkland related to me at large the
unfortunate con&s;equences that letter had
produced. He lamented, in the tendere&s;t
manner, my unhappy &s;ituation; told me,
he would provide me a proper place for
my retreat; and, as I was an entire &s;tran|ger
in London, having never been there,
would recommend me to the notice of
one of the be&s;t of women, lady Bidulph,
from whom, as my unhappy &s;tory was
known to her, I might expect the utmo&s;t
humanity. And here, madam, with
blu&s;hes let me own it, he urged me not
to conceal a &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the
truth from that lady.</P>
<P>&startq;You know, &s;aid he, my dear mi&s;s
Burchell, I am not a <HI>&s;educer;</HI> re&s;cue
me from that black &s;u&s;picion; and, as
far as the unhappy ca&s;e will admit,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
clear my honour to lady Bidulph. See
what a reliance I have on <HI>your</HI> honour,
when I tru&s;t the vindicating of my own
to you, in &s;uch delicate circum&s;tances.
He concluded his letter with telling me
frankly, that though he had been re|jected
by Mi&s;s Bidulph, he loved her
with &s;uch an ardent pa&s;&s;ion, that it was
impo&s;&s;ible for him ever to think of any
other woman; and till he had a heart
to be&s;tow, he &s;hould never entertain a
thought of marriage.&endq;</P>
<P>You know Mr. Faulkland at this junc|ture
went abroad; and thus was I cir|cum&s;tanced
when I came to that hou&s;e,
which he had provided for me. And &s;o
frank and noble were his proceedings,
that I &s;olemnly declare, I was determin|ed,
though at the hazard of divulging
my own &s;hame, to have acquitted him
to the utmo&s;t of my power to lady Bi|dulph;
and &s;hould have rejoiced, could
I have been the means of procuring him
the happine&s;s he de&s;erved, in regaining
your favour; as I had been, though un|knowingly,
the unlucky cau&s;e of his lo&s;ing
it. But fortune had di&s;po&s;ed of you other|wi&s;e,
before I &s;aw lady Bidulph. This
&s;he quickly informed me of, and I will
own to you, madam, that as I found
there was now an in&s;uperable bar to Mr.
<PB N="136" REF="137">
Faulkland's hopes, I was mean enough
not to have the courage to &s;peak truth.
I &s;aw it could not avail him, in regard to
his pro&s;pects with you. Lady Bidulph's
eye awed me; yet I think &s;he led me in|to
a ju&s;tification of my&s;elf, &s;o great were
her prejudices again&s;t Mr. Faulkland. Or,
perhaps, having already di&s;po&s;ed of you
in marriage in vindication of this &s;tep,
&s;he did not wi&s;h to be undeceived. Yes,
again, in &s;pite of my confu&s;ion, I mu&s;t
repeat it, I was not &s;incere; I threw out
&s;uch hints to lady Bidulph, as mu&s;t have
made her think Mr. Faulkland had taken
pains to undo me: to this act of di&s;in|genuou&s;ne&s;s,
my &s;ole motive was, that I
might appear in a le&s;s culpable light in
the eyes of a lady of &s;uch &s;trict virtue
as your mother. By making her my
friend, I was in hopes one day of making
you &s;o too. Devoted, as Mr. Faulkland
was, to the mo&s;t charming woman in
the world, I was not afraid of his making
a &s;econd choice. I thought, if he <HI>were</HI>
to be induced to marry, he might, in
time, be prevailed upon to turn his thoughts
towards me. In this hope I have dragged
on &s;o many tedious years. I was not mi&s;|taken
in my opinion, that he could find
none worthy to &s;ucceed Mrs. Arnold in
his heart. He loves you &s;till, madam;
<PB N="137" REF="138">
but you have declared you never will be
his; he is &s;till free; the&s;e are the circum|&s;tances
that nouri&s;h my hope. My heart
is in your hand; I have made you mi&s;|tre&s;s
of my deare&s;t &s;ecret. Can you for|give
me, madam? But you have an he|roic
&s;oul! Remember, Mrs. Arnold, to
your genero&s;ity I now tru&s;t what is dearer
to me than life. Should Mr. Faulkland
know, &s;hould lady Bidulph know, how I
have abu&s;ed their confidence, I think I
could not out-live it.</P>
<P>They never &s;hall, madam, &s;aid I: I
thank you for this frank acknowledgment
of your heart; &s;uch a proof of your
confidence in me, I &s;hould be a wretch
to abu&s;e; and I hope to make &s;uch a
u&s;e of the candid confe&s;&s;ion you have now
made me, as will greatly promote your
intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible, madam, &s;aid &s;he,
you can yield up the intere&s;t you have
in Mr. Faulkland without a pang? Oh!
the exqui&s;ite charmer! and &s;he &s;aid it
with &s;uch an empha&s;is, drawing out
her breath in long &s;ighs. But you are
heroic, as I &s;aid before: Nature did not
mold your heart, as &s;he has done tho&s;e
of the re&s;t of your &s;ex. Who that was
beloved by Mr. Faulkland, would yield,
him to another? Worlds! ten thou&s;and
<PB N="138" REF="139">
worlds would I give to be beloved by
him as you are! but you are a prodigy of
a woman! I &s;topped Mi&s;s Burchell in
her tran&s;ports. There is le&s;s merit,
madam, than you a&s;cribe to me in my
conduct: I readily acquie&s;ced under my
mother's rejection of Mr. Faulkland,
when he <HI>had</HI> &s;ome intere&s;t in my heart;
but there is no &s;elf-denial in what I am
now about to do for you. My affecti|ons
have long &s;ince changed their object,
and now lie buried with him in his
grave.</P>
<P>My tears here bore witne&s;s to the
truth of what I &s;aid: Mi&s;s Burchell wept
too. Her mind was agitated; the con|fe&s;&s;ion
&s;he had made to me had hum|bled
her; her heart overflowed with
fondne&s;s; I had filled her with plea&s;ing
hopes: all the&s;e &s;en&s;ations combined
together, melted her into tenderne&s;s:
&s;he is made up of tears, and &s;ighs, and
romantic wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I can now, &s;aid I, a&s;&s;ure Mr. Faulk|land,
that you have done him ju&s;tice,
and that he is highly obliged to your
candour.</P>
<P>She interrupted me; But, madam,
if he &s;hould know how <HI>late</HI> my acknow|legements
came&mdash;He need not know
it, &s;aid I; my mother &s;hall not know
<PB N="139" REF="140">
it neither; leave every thing to my
management, and depend upon my word.
She &s;natched my hand eagerly, and ki&s;|&s;ed
it.</P>
<P>But oh! madam, above all things,
&s;aid &s;he, let not Sir George Bidulph
know any thing of your intended good|ne&s;s,
in mediating for me. He hates
me, implacably he hates me. I upbraid
him not for it: his &s;trong attachment to
Mr. Faulkland is the cau&s;e of it: he ac|cu&s;es
me in his heart of being the occa&s;i|on,
(which I own I was, though ignorant|ly)
of Mr. Falkland's di&s;appointment.
I am &s;ure, were he to know what you de|&s;ign
in my favour, he would counterwork
you, and u&s;e all his influence over his
friend to ruin me.</P>
<P>I made her ea&s;y on this head, by a&s;&s;ur|ing
her Sir George &s;hould know nothing
of the matter; and put her in mind how
lucky it was for her that he was ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking, my Cecilia,
that there is a &s;ort of a fatality has at|tended
Mr. Faulkland's attachment to
me. By what a &s;trange accident did we
come to the knowledge of Mi&s;s Burchell's
affair! How &s;trong were my mother's
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t Mr. Faulkland; and
how many little circum&s;tances concur|red
to encourage her in this di&s;po&s;iti|on!
<PB N="140" REF="141">
His letter from Bath to my bro|ther
helped to confirm her in her di&s;|like
of his conduct; Mi&s;s Burchell's let|ter
to Mr. Faulkland, though meant
very differently, was a &s;trong motive
of condemnation. The only means of
ju&s;tification left for him, my mother did
not apply to, till it was too late; and
then that very circum&s;tance of it's <HI>be|ing</HI>
too late to &s;erve him, Mi&s;s Bur|chell
acknowledges, was the rea&s;on that
the very method which he had propo&s;ed
for his defence, was turned to his con|demnation.</P>
<P>Rooted, as my mother's prejudices
were, &s;he engages her&s;elf, &s;he engages
me, in a promi&s;e, to u&s;e my endea|vours
to promote Mi&s;s Burchell's mar|riage
with Mr. Faulkland. Does not all
this look as if &s;ome un&s;een power, who
guides our actions, had &s;et a &s;tamp of
di&s;approbation on the union between this
man and me.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I had &s;een that letter which
Mr. Faulkland wrote to my brother from
Bath: my mother &s;aid, &s;he did not read
it through. He treated the &s;ubject light|ly,
and there was one circum&s;tance in
particular in it that &s;hocked her; and
yet &s;urely, if the <HI>whole</HI> might not have
borne a favourable con&s;truction, Sir George
<PB N="141" REF="142">
would not have &s;hewn her that account,
by way of ju&s;tifying his friend. This
reflection comes too late! Why did it
not occur &s;ooner to my mother or to
me? We drew no other inference from
Sir George's di&s;clo&s;ing this letter, than
that as Mr. Faulkland treated the affair
ludicrou&s;ly, it was therefore expected,
both by him and my brother, that we
&s;hould con&s;ider it &s;o too. That could
not have been the ca&s;e. Mi&s;s Bur|chell's
confe&s;&s;ion has opened my eyes&mdash;Poor
Mr. Faulkland! What a
wayward fate is thine! But let me be|ware
of relenting; that might be fa|tal.
There is &s;till one indelible blot re|mains
upon his conduct. Mi&s;s Burchell,
blameable as &s;he acknowledges her&s;elf,
was &s;till betrayed; and though not by
Mr. Faulkland, yet &s;ure his having paid
the price of her innocence to the wick|ed
aunt, renders him &s;o far guilty, as
that he owes her a great reparation.
This was a particular I dur&s;t not touch
upon; the unhappy girl her&s;elf being
ignorant of it. There is a wide gulph
fixed between Mr. Faulkland and me.
How many things are leagued again&s;t
him? Alas! he thinks the principle bar
to his hopes is removed, and that if
Mi&s;s Burchell has been ju&s;t, he ought
<PB N="142" REF="143">
to be forgiven. But he little knows thy
Sidney's heart; critically delicate as my
&s;ituation is, in regard to him, I am re|moved
a thou&s;and times farther than
ever from his wi&s;hes. Neither knows
he the engagements I am under to Mi&s;s
Burchell; which alone would put an
everla&s;ting bar between us. Unhappy
Mi&s;s Burchell! She has bound me to
her by &s;tronger ties than ever. She
has been ingenuous; &s;he has owned her
weakne&s;s to me; &s;he declares &s;he would
have done this &s;ooner, if it could have
promoted my happine&s;s: perhaps &s;he
would; &s;hall I not then endeavour to
promote her's? I will, I mu&s;t; my
word is given. Yet Faulkland de&s;erves&mdash;oh!
he de&s;erves a worthier lot.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22.&mdash;I now &s;end you, my <HI>Cecilia,</HI>
my &s;econd letter to Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&startq;Why do you compel me, Sir, no|ble
and di&s;intere&s;ted as your conduct
has been towards me, to accu&s;e you
now of unkindne&s;s? You call me in|&s;en&s;ible&mdash;Oh!
it is from my too
great &s;en&s;ibility that all my &s;orrows
have &s;prung. De&s;titute as I am of
happine&s;s my&s;elf, or even of a po&s;&s;ibili|ty
<PB N="143" REF="144">
of ever attaining it here, I look
for no other comfort in this life, but
what mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;eeing tho&s;e
whom I mo&s;t e&s;teem in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that tranquility of mind, which I can
never hope to enjoy. If Mr. Faulk|land
were happy, if Mi&s;s Burchell were
happy, I &s;hould be le&s;s mi&s;erable. Re|member,
Sir, it was not this lady's
fault that you were di&s;appointed in
your former hope. She did not try,
by female wiles, to engage a heart
which you refu&s;ed her. She u&s;ed no
ungenerous arts to cro&s;s your wi&s;hes.
Loving you, as &s;he did, almo&s;t to
di&s;traction, &s;he yielded you up in &s;i|lent
angui&s;h to a rival; a rival &s;upe|rior
to her&s;elf in nothing. I acknow|ledge,
Sir, I was to have been yours,
and with my own con&s;ent; but was
it not al&s;o with my own con&s;ent tho&s;e
bonds were cancelled, by which we
were to have been united? I was
then convinced Mi&s;s Burchell had a
prior claim; I think &s;o &s;till, and ever
&s;hall. Mi&s;s Burchell's family is not
mean, her fortune is con&s;iderable; her
beauty and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments
inferior to none; and, but for Mr.
Faulkland, &s;he had been innocent.
Yet do not imagine I would aggra|vate
<PB N="144" REF="145">
your fault; Mi&s;s Burchell's can|dor
could not &s;uffer this. How char|mingly
ingenuous was her confe&s;&s;ion!
In the mid&s;t of tears and blu&s;hes, &s;he
owned her weakne&s;s; you, &s;he &s;aid,
were not to blame. She prai&s;ed your
genero&s;ity, your compa&s;&s;ion, the in|tegrity
and frankne&s;s of your whole
behaviour towards her; and could Mi&s;s
Burchell's &s;uffrage have en&s;ured to
you the completion of your wi&s;hes,
Mr. Faulkland would have been in|debted
to her for what he once thought
his happine&s;s. But though her te&s;ti|mony
could not avail you in that par|ticular,
yet are your obligations to her
the &s;ame. Does not then Mi&s;s Bur|chell
love Mr. Faulkland with a ge|nero&s;ity
equal to his own? Do years
of fervent and unalterable affection
de&s;erve no return? Does the child,
the dear innocent that calls you fa|ther,
de&s;erve no con&s;ideration? He
bears your name, Sir; let him not
blu&s;h to own it: he may one day
be an honour and a comfort to you.
Put it in his power to make it his
boa&s;t, in&s;tead of his &s;hame, that Mr.
Faulkland was his father. The ami|able
lady, who&s;e very life is bound
up in you, has, in the mid&s;t of her
<PB N="145" REF="146">
affliction, one great &s;ource of comfort;
her character has e&s;caped the malig|nity
of cruel tongues, by the privacy
with which &s;he conducted her mea|&s;ures,
till after the birth of your &s;on.
The retirement &s;he has &s;ince lived
in; her prudent, her mode&s;t, her ex|emplary
conduct, have created e&s;teem
in every body that knows her; this
circum&s;tance, as it is a peculiar feli|city
to her&s;elf, &s;o ought it to be a
motive of encouragement to you, Sir,
to complete her happine&s;s. The fal&s;e-judging
part of the world will have
nothing to point at; Mi&s;s Burehell's
relation, or even connection with Mrs.
Gerrarde is hardly known here; &s;he
has had no corre&s;pondence with that
irregular woman &s;ince &s;he became a
widow; and her character had not
&s;uffered before, in &s;uch a manner, as
to reflect di&s;honour on the young la|dy,
who was then under her care.
How then can you per&s;i&s;t in a cruel
rejection of this lady? You own &s;he
is amiable: I am &s;ure &s;he has a thou|&s;and
good qualities. Is her love for
you, her unparalleled love, to be im|puted
to her as a crime? if it be
one, long and bitter has been her
puni&s;hment! On you it re&s;ts to re|compence
her &s;ufferings. What may
<PB N="146" REF="147">
you not expect from a grateful heart
that wor&s;hips you? Such a fervent,
&s;uch a faithful love (de&s;erving as you
are) you perhaps may never a|gain
meet with in woman. With
her you may be happy, &s;he will
make it the whole &s;tudy of her life
to render you &s;o. Your own heart,
con&s;cious of having acted nobly, will
confirm your happine&s;s. Would to
God I could in&s;pire you with &s;uch
&s;entiments as would induce you to
make the generous experiment! How
would your character ri&s;e in the e&s;|teem
of the two per&s;ons whom you
profe&s;s to revere! How would you be
adored by the amiable &s;ufferer! but
above all, how delightful mu&s;t be
the exultations of the &s;elf-approving
mind! There wants but this act to
render you the mo&s;t de&s;erving of men.
I would fain e&s;teem, re&s;pect, admire you
as I ought; but you will not let me:
you will be a <HI>common</HI> man, and un|di&s;tingui&s;hed,
among&s;t the light ones
of your &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;hewed this letter to Mi&s;s Burchell;
&s;he read it with grateful tears running
down her cheeks. In about an hour
I received the following an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Burchell may triumph, Ma|dam,
&s;ince &s;he has obtained <HI>you</HI> for
<PB N="147" REF="148">
her advocate. Well have you acquit|ted
your&s;elf of the ta&s;k your rigid
heart has undertaken. I thank the
lady for the ju&s;tice her charming in|genuou&s;ne&s;s
(as you rightly call it)
has done me. But what have I gained
by this? Have I not rai&s;ed the fair
complainant &s;till higher in your e&s;|teem,
given her a &s;tronger claim to
your pity, and furni&s;hed you with
arms again&s;t my&s;elf? Wretch that I
am, I do, I mu&s;t acknowledge the
force of every thing that you have
urged. Mi&s;s Burchell is amiable, her
&s;incerity, her con&s;tancy and (by me)
unmerited love, de&s;erve to be greatly
recompenced. I would to heaven I
had a heart to give her! but I have
not; <HI>you</HI> know I have not; <HI>&s;he</HI> knows
it too. Could I have made Mi&s;s Bur|chell
the return &s;he de&s;erves, I would
not thus long have &s;hunned her pre|&s;ence.
I acknowledged the &s;tate of
my heart to her even at the time I
had lo&s;t all hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you.
And in the &s;pite of my own &s;trug|gles,
after years of confirmed de&s;pair,
I found my&s;elf &s;till en&s;laved. How
then could I offer a hand, devoted
as my whole &s;oul was to another ob|ject,
to a lady, who&s;e con&s;tant, ten|der,
and delicate affection, demanded
<PB N="148" REF="149">
all the return that a &s;en&s;ible and grate|ful
heart could make? This, Madam,
is all the plea I can urge in an&s;wer to
tho&s;e arguments you offer to promote
your favourite wi&s;h. Con&s;alt your own
delicacy, let Mi&s;s Burchell con&s;ult hers,
and then perhaps I &s;hall &s;tand acquit|ted
of ingratitude.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hoped, Madam, that cleared as I
have been of <HI>one</HI> imputation, I might
have recovered &s;ome favour in your's
and Lady Bidulph's thoughts. I was
flattered with this con&s;olation, &s;mall
as it was, when every other hope for|&s;ook
me. But when an unexpected
event again brought happine&s;s within
my pro&s;pect, this reflection, I own, be|came
of more importance, and &s;erved
to &s;trengthen my then revived hopes.
But you da&s;h them with an unrelent|ing
hand; and again build up tho&s;e bar|riers
between us, that heaven it&s;elf
had overthrown. What can I &s;ay to
you, inflexible as you are? has Mi&s;s
Burchell <HI>all</HI> your pity? You may com|mand
my life, Madam; I would lay
it down freely for you; but I cannot,
mu&s;t not, will not give up my love;
and till you declare in expre&s;s terms
that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be mi&s;erable, I will not even
give up my hope.&endq;</P>

See, my Cecilia, the heart I have to
deal with. Hard to be &s;ubdued, and ob|&s;tinate
in all its purpo&s;es. I expected
difficulties, but was in hopes he would
be le&s;s determined in regard to his per|&s;everance
towards me. I think however
I have gained &s;ome ground; he acknow|ledges
Mi&s;s Burchell's merit, and &s;eems
obliged to her for the part &s;he has ac|ted
towards him. I have been under
&s;ome difficulties on this occa&s;ion; for as
Mi&s;s Burchell was not &s;o candid in her
acknowledgments to my mother as &s;he
has been to me, I cannot let her know
the whole of her confe&s;&s;ion; for this
rea&s;on, I only told her the general pur|port
of what I wrote la&s;t to Mr. Faulk|land;
and in reading his an&s;wer to her,
I pa&s;&s;ed over &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as I thought
might induce her to require an expla|nation.
I own I am a little hurt at Mi&s;s
Burchell's former perverting of facts on
this occa&s;ion; but, as I have already &s;aid
more than once, there are great allowan|ces
to be made for one in her very cri|tical
&s;ituation. Neither have I the lea&s;t
right to reproach her for it even in my
thoughts; for had &s;he been ever &s;o expli|cit
at my mother's fir&s;t interview with
her, it could not have availed me.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">
You find, my dear, it is nece&s;&s;ary I
&s;hould &s;peak plainly to Mr. Faulkland.
I &s;hall write to him again, and here you
&s;hall have a copy of what I &s;ay; but I

<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mrs. Arnold's third letter to Mr. Faulk|land.</OPENER>
<P>&startq;You give me plea&s;ure, Sir; I begin
to de&s;cry hopes for your and my a|miable
friend. I know &s;uch a heart as
Mr. Faulkland's cannot be proof again&s;t
&s;entiments of gratitude and compa&s;&s;i|on;
it will not be difficult to convert
tho&s;e &s;entiments into love, when the
object is &s;o de&s;erving. Try, Sir, try;
the experiment cannot fail. How much
to your honour will &s;o noble a triumph
be over an ill-fated pa&s;&s;ion! What de|lightful
returns may you not expect
from the obliged, the grateful partner
of your happine&s;s! Do not call me in|flexible,
or rigid; filled as I am with
gratitude, and a &s;en&s;e of your merit,
I &s;hould hate my&s;elf if I did not ac|knowledge
that you de&s;erve more from
me than it can ever be in my power
to repay. I mu&s;t be plain with you,
&s;ince you require it; it is impo&s;&s;ible I
<PB N="151" REF="152">
ever can be yours. Sorry I am, that
the nece&s;&s;ity of circum&s;tances compels
me to make &s;o early a declaration, from
which I thought my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion
would have exempted me; but I
forgive you, Sir, for urging me on this
head, and draw a happy, pre&s;age from
your re&s;ting your hopes in relation to
me, on my own determination. You
appeal to my delicacy, whether you
ought, with a heart e&s;tranged, to offer
your hand to Mi&s;s Burchell? Were de|licacy
alone to be con&s;ulted, the an|&s;wer
perhaps might be ea&s;y; but there
are &s;uperior con&s;iderations in your
ca&s;e; to be taken in love, without
doubt, demands love in return; but
where injured honour is to be repair|ed,
where the di&s;grace of a darling
child is to be prevented, tho&s;e nicer
&s;entiments of the &s;oul mu&s;t and ought
to give way; and I will venture to
pronounce, that Mi&s;s Burchell would,
with raptures, receive the hand which
would confer &s;uch valuable ble&s;&s;ings
on her; leaving it to time, and her
own unremitting tenderne&s;s and a&s;&s;i|duity,
to get an intere&s;t in the heart,
which, by &s;uch an act, proved its
own rectitude. On this &s;ubject. I,
from experience, am qualified to &s;peak.
You know, Sir, the intere&s;t you once
<PB N="152" REF="153">
had in me; you cannot think me &s;o
light a creature, as to &s;uppo&s;e I &s;o
&s;oon after my breaking with you, be|&s;towed
my affections on another. I
did not; obedience to my mother's
commands was the &s;ole motive which
engaged my vows to Mr. Arnold; and
I married him with no other &s;enti|ments,
than tho&s;e of e&s;teem and gra|titude
for the great love he bore me.
Yet from the&s;e &s;eeds &s;own in my heart,
&s;prung a tender an ardent affection: ne|ver
did wife love a hu&s;band better than
I did Mr. Arnold; his kindne&s;s merited,
and <HI>did</HI> win my whole affections; nor
could a temporary alienation of his
heart, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of the place he
he held in <HI>mine.</HI> His returning love
(for which, with all thankfulne&s;s, I
own my&s;elf bound to yon, Sir) made
him &s;till dearer to me than ever, and
I now profe&s;s my&s;elf wedded to his
memory. You have a right, Sir, to
expect that I &s;hould explain my&s;elf at
once to you on this &s;ubject; for your
own &s;ake, and for Mi&s;s Burchell's, I
mu&s;t not &s;uffer you to entertain a
doubt of my re&s;olution. You com|pel
me to repeat, that I think Mi&s;s
Burchell de&s;erves your love, and has a
ju&s;t right to your hand. She throws
her&s;elf upon your honour, without pre|tending
<PB N="153" REF="154">
to have any <HI>lawful</HI> claim; if
&s;he <HI>had,</HI> I &s;hould not conde&s;cend to
&s;olicit the man who could refu&s;e to do
her ju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My mother is firm to her fir&s;t re|&s;olves;
could you place a crown on
my head, her integrity would &s;till o|blige
her to reject it; nor would a
crown tempt me to forfeit the duty
which I owe to her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;See then, Sir, if that <HI>unexpected
event</HI> which you mention (a fatal event
to me!) has brought you nearer to
your wi&s;hes; and here let me add,
in ju&s;tice to my own particular &s;en|timents,
that I think Mr. Faulkland
is the la&s;t man who ought to be my
choice, even if my heart were di&s;po|&s;ed
to make one. Reproach me not
with ingratitude, or caprice, till I
have explained my&s;elf. It is not
long, Sir, (blamele&s;s and uncon&s;cious
as you were of the injury, and nobly
as you repaired it) &s;ince you were the
cau&s;e of a &s;eparation between me and
my hu&s;band. I know you will &s;ay
that our mutual innocence on this oc|ca&s;ion,
and the &s;ecret's being known
but to a few of our friends, make
that objection of little weight. I
grant you, with many it might be
&s;o; all minds are not equally &s;u&s;cep|tible;
<PB N="154" REF="155">
'tis my unhappine&s;s to have a
too re&s;enting heart. My own honour
(&s;crupulous you may call it) would not
&s;uffer me to let the man &s;ucceed Mr.
Arnold in my love, who was the oc|ca&s;ion
of &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s to him,
and the cau&s;e of my being &s;u&s;pected
in my fidelity. Would it not be an
in&s;ult on his memory? Oh, Sir,
what is the world's opinion to the
approbation, of our own hearts! mine
has never yet reproached me, and
this has been my &s;upport in all my
trials. Thus much I &s;ay for the re|verence
I bear my dear Mr. Arnold's
memory: but I have other rea&s;ons to
offer in my excu&s;e; refinements you
will call them, but my heart feels
their force. I am not the &s;ame wo|man
whom you once loved; afflicti|ons
have impaired my health, and
tho&s;e little advantages of per&s;on which
nature be&s;towed on me, have not been
improved by time; my &s;pirits, bro|ken
by misfortunes, have left me
languid and in&s;en&s;ible to joy. Peace
is the utmo&s;t of my wi&s;h, and all that
I am now capable of reli&s;hing. The
bride, whom Mr. Faulkland once
&s;ought, was in the bloom of youth,
admired and care&s;&s;ed by a flattering
world; unblemi&s;hed in her character,
<PB N="155" REF="156">
her fortune equal to her wi&s;hes: her
heart, her virgin heart, was then a
pre&s;ent, (with pride let me &s;ay it)
worthy of any man's acceptance.
It was then in her power to be&s;tow
happine&s;s, and Mr. Faulkland would
not have been matched unequally.
But the &s;cene is changed; what
&s;hould I now bring to your arms? A
per&s;on faded by grief; a reputation
(though unde&s;ervedly) once called in
que&s;tion; a little helple&s;s family with|out
fortune; a widowed heart, dead
to love, and incapable of plea&s;ure.
Oh, Sir! could I bear to be your
wife on &s;uch conditions? Indebted to
you as I am, pa&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility of
my ever making you a return, to
what a mighty &s;um would you rai&s;e
the obligation? How poor would
you make me in my own eyes?
Humbled as I am by adver&s;ity,
my &s;oul has &s;till too much pride,
or let me call it delicacy, to &s;ub|mit
to this. No, if there was
no Mi&s;s Burchell in the world,
no parental &s;way to guide me, in
my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I never
would be yours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You, have now before you my fi|nal
determination. I &s;hall trouble
you no more on the &s;ubject. If
<PB N="156" REF="157">
your heart relents towards Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
great will be your reward. In
her you are &s;ure of a tender, faithful,
and charming friend; who will more
than repay every act of kindne&s;s to|wards
her; and he who is the au|thor
of ju&s;tice and mercy will not fail
to ble&s;s you.&endq;</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Methinks, my dear friend, I have
now ea&s;ed my heart of a load that
oppre&s;&s;ed it. What can I &s;ay more?
Mr. Faulkland now knows my deter|mined
purpo&s;e in regard to my&s;elf;
and if he is not quite in&s;en&s;ible, I
think Mi&s;s Burchell mu&s;t at la&s;t obtain
the wi&s;h of her &s;oul. Oh, my Cecilia,
I would not have my heart devoured
by &s;uch a flame as her's, for the
whole world. But have I not acted
as I &s;hould do? I hope I have; I feel
&s;atisfied with my own conduct, and I
never yet found that to be the ca&s;e
when I acted wrong. There are &s;ome
nice points, in which our own hearts
are the be&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t im|partial
judges. If Mr. Faulkland per|&s;i&s;ts
in rejecting poor Mi&s;s Burchell, I
can urge him no farther; but I am
determined not to &s;ee him.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
<HI>June</HI> 25.&mdash;How unea&s;y has been my
&s;u&s;pence the&s;e three days! I que&s;tion if
Mi&s;s Burchell's is much greater. No an|&s;wer
from this &s;trange man; perhaps he
is flown off again.&mdash;No, I wrong him,
a letter is this minute brought up to me
from him.&mdash;Read it, read it, my belov|ed,
and congratulate me.</P>
<P>&startq;You were born to conquer, Ma|dam;
what is there that you cannot ef|fect?
My heart was made for you,
and you can mould it as you plea&s;e.
Enjoy your triumph, if it be one. I
will receive Mi&s;s Burchell as <HI>your</HI>
gift; and &s;ince I cannot obtain your
love, I will at lea&s;t compel your e&s;teem.
Why &s;hould <HI>your</HI> genero&s;ity, <HI>your</HI> com|pa&s;&s;ion
for an unhappy lady, to whom
you have no obligation, exceed that of a
man who owns him&s;elf bound to her in
gratitude? I wi&s;h I could repay her the
debt of love I owe her, but I will try
to repair my fault hereafter; and in her
gentle bo&s;om perhaps I may recover
that peace, to which I have been &s;o
long a &s;tranger. She will forgive the
waywardne&s;s of a heart, which never
di&s;gui&s;ed its angui&s;h to her; and which
&s;he knows has been torn by a fatal pa&s;|&s;ion,
that, like a cruel di&s;ea&s;e, was not
either to be re&s;i&s;ted or &s;ubdued. But
thanks to you, Madam, I think I be|gin
<PB N="158" REF="159">
to feel my cure approaching. Mi&s;s
Burchell's tenderne&s;s will fini&s;h what
you have begun. You &s;hall never ap|proach
me more; if I <HI>ever</HI> had an
intere&s;t in your heart, I will not forfeit
it now, but make that proud heart ac|knowledge,
&s;pite of it&s;elf, that Mr. Faulk|land
was not unworthy of it.&endq;</P>
<P>Ha! my Cecilia, what do you &s;ay to my
Orlando now! <HI>My</HI> Orlando let me this
once call him. Has he not a noble mind!
Happy! happy Mi&s;s Burchell! you are at
length arrived at the &s;ummit of your wi&s;h|es.
Long may you enjoy them, and may
you make your love as ble&s;t as he de|&s;erves
to be! My mother cla&s;ped her
hands together in joy, when I read this
letter to her. God ble&s;s him, God ble&s;s
him, &s;aid &s;he; he is now indeed a
righteous man. How rejoiced I am, my
dear, that I have been the means of bring|ing
about this &s;o-much-wi&s;hed-for event.
And yet, methinks, if I were in Mi&s;s
Burchell's place, though my heart doat|ed
on the man to death, I could not re|ceive
him on &s;uch terms. He accepts her
as <HI>my</HI> gift; it is to rai&s;e him&s;elf in <HI>my</HI> e&s;|teem,
he does her ju&s;tice: Nay, I think
the a&s;&s;uming man &s;eems to in&s;inuate a &s;ort
of &s;uperiority over me, by this conce&s;&s;ion.
Why let it be &s;o, I &s;hall be content in
my humiliation, if <HI>my</HI> gift will re&s;tore
<PB N="159" REF="160">
him to his peace. If it does, which I pray
heaven it may, ought he not think him|&s;elf
indebted to me?</P>
<P>I think I &s;hould not let Mi&s;s Burchell &s;ee
this la&s;t letter; he does not con&s;ent with
a good grace; and it may damp her
joy. Though, upon &s;econd thoughts, I
que&s;tion whether &s;he has delicacy enough
to be much affected by this circum|&s;tance.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am &s;aved the trouble of ob&s;erving any
decorum towards Mi&s;s Burchell. She has
been ju&s;t here, wild with tran&s;port; and was
&s;everal minutes in the room before I could
get her to &s;peak coherently. She had re|ceived
a letter from Mr. Faulkland written
by his own angelic hand, &s;he &s;aid. She
made no difficulty of leaving it with me,
and here it is.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland's letter to Mi&s;s Burch|ell.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I congratulated Mi&s;s Burchell (after
reading this letter) on her approaching
felicity. She had not words to expre&s;s
her acknowledgments to me. The &s;ervice
I had rendered her was indeed to her a
mo&s;t important one; and there are &s;ome
occa&s;ions where <HI>words</HI> are of no u&s;e;
Mi&s;s Burchell can be eloquent without
them. She embraced me a thou&s;and
times, and wept in tender tran&s;port on
my neck.</P>
<P>My mother is as much delighted at
this happy event, as if it immediately
concerned her own welfare. She recom|mended
<PB N="161" REF="162">
it to Mi&s;s Burchell, to have her
little boy with her when Mr. Faulkland
came to vi&s;it her. It &s;eems he has not
&s;een the child &s;ince his la&s;t return to Eng|land:
he did not care to go to the hou&s;e
where it was boarded, for fear of
drawing any ob&s;ervation on him&s;elf to
Mi&s;s Burchell's prejudice; and the peo|ple
never permitted the child to be
taken abroad by any one but Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
(who pa&s;&s;es for its aunt) or Mr.
Faulkland's hou&s;e-keeper; but this good
woman, happening to be &s;ick when he
came to town, Mr. Faulkland had not an
opportunity of &s;ending for it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Burchell greatly approved of the
motion, and flew from us to prepare for
this &s;o-much-de&s;ired interview.</P>
<P>And now my Cecilia, do you not think
Mr. Faulkland has proved him&s;elf a di|&s;intere&s;ted
(lover &s;hall I &s;ay) of your Sid|ney?
indeed he has given a noble te&s;ti|mony
of his e&s;teem and deference for
me, as well as he formerly did of his affec|tion.
If Mi&s;s Burchell does not render
her&s;elf worthy of him, how I &s;hall hate
my&s;elf for having brought about this uni|on!
But &s;he loves him too ardently, and
is her&s;elf too lovely, not to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on
of his heart, when it becomes his du|ty,
as well as his intere&s;t, to give it up to
<PB N="162" REF="163">
her. All acquaintance between her and
me, mu&s;t now cea&s;e; for her &s;ake, as well
as Mr. Faulkland's, this will be nece&s;&s;ary;
my pre&s;ence may di&s;turb, but never can
contribute to the tranquillity of either of
them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 26&mdash;Mi&s;s Burchell was in too much
ha&s;te to communicate her joy to us, to
defer the giving an account of what pa&s;&s;ed
between her and Mr. Faulkland ye&s;terday
evening. She hurried to us la&s;t night, at
almo&s;t ten o'clock.</P>
<P>He came to her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, at &s;ix,
the hour &s;he had appointed him; and look|ed
<HI>&s;o</HI> enchantingly. She her&s;elf was dre&s;|&s;ed
out very elegantly to receive him, and
I thought looked really charming; her
countenance was &s;o lightned up with joy,
that &s;he did not appear the &s;ame wo|man.</P>
<P>She had endeavoured, &s;he &s;aid, to com|po&s;e
her&s;elf for this interview, and had
tried to a&s;&s;ume &s;omething of dignity; but it
all vani&s;hed when her conqueror approach|ed,
and the tumult of her heart &s;o intirely
bani&s;hed all recollection, and pre&s;ence of
mind, that &s;he was not able to tell me in
what manner &s;he received him. She only
knows, &s;he &s;ays, that having &s;natched up
her little boy, who &s;tood by her and hung
<PB N="163" REF="164">
on her gown, &s;he put him into his father's
arms, and bidding the babe thank him for
his goodne&s;s, &s;he bur&s;t into tears. Mr.
Faulkland tenderly embraced the child,
not without a vi&s;ible emotion of counte|nance;
and having gently &s;et him down
again, he placed him&s;elf by Mi&s;s Burchell's
&s;ide: She was &s;till &s;obbing. Tho&s;e gene|rous
tears, Madam, &s;aid he, taking her by
the hand, reproach me too much: I have
not de&s;erved this tenderne&s;s; I cannot look
upon you, nor that dear boy, without
blu&s;hing; but you have forgiven me; it
&s;hall be the &s;tudy of my life to make you
both happy. Oh! Madam, continued Mi&s;s
Burchell, what an exqui&s;ite joy mu&s;t &s;uch
a declaration give me from the beloved of
my &s;oul. I wrung his hand; Oh, Sir, you
are too, too good: What return can I
make you? One thing only &s;ay to me,
that you do not offer me a <HI>very</HI> reluctant
hand, and I &s;hall then be the happie&s;t of
women.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland pau&s;ed a little while,
and then, with a noble frankne&s;s, replied:
&startq;You know, my dear Mi&s;s Burchell,
with what an exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion I have
ever loved Mrs. Arnold: Had no &s;uch
woman exi&s;ted, <HI>you</HI> would have been
my choice, preferably to any other:
but when I fir&s;t knew you, I looked
<PB N="164" REF="165">
upon my&s;elf as bound to her, though, at
that time, I had never &s;een her: my
knowledge of her afterwards confirmed
me her's. I made no &s;ecret of this to you,
and you may remember what my de|clarations
to you were, even at the time
my hopes were fru&s;trated. I have loved
her fervently ever &s;ince; even in the
arms of a hu&s;band I adored her; and
I will be candid enough to own to you,
that, as my attachment to her has, du|ring
all that time, e&s;tranged me from
you, &s;o &s;hould I &s;till, had I the lea&s;t
hopes of &s;ucceeding, have per&s;i&s;ted in
my &s;uit. But &s;he has cut off all hope;
&s;he has declared &s;he never can be mine,
and at the &s;ame time has repre&s;ented
my obligations, to you in &s;o &s;trong a light,
that I am convinced I ought to be your's.
And let me own, Madam, (you who
are generous, and know what it is to
love, will pardon a declaration which I
dur&s;t not make to any other woman)
to you I will confe&s;s that Mrs. Arnold
is arbitre&s;s of my fate; and in approv|ing
my&s;elf to her, I do &s;o to my own
con&s;cience. I do not therefore, though
my actions have been guided by her,
yield with reluctance to her will: her
virtue, her religion, and enlarged mind,
<PB N="165" REF="166">
have only dictated to me, what my
own rea&s;on tells me I ought to do. I
have been a &s;lave to a hopele&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion
too long; I am now re&s;olved to
&s;truggle with my chains: you, madam,
mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me in breaking them in|tirely;
and I make no doubt but that
time, joined to my own efforts, and
aided by yout &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;i|tion,
your tenderne&s;s, and admirable
&s;en&s;e, will enable me to conquer what
I mu&s;t now call a weakne&s;s, and make
the triumph equally happy for us both.
But remember, madam, I never &s;ee
Mrs. Arnold more. 'Tis for your
peace &s;ake as well as my own, that
I make this a preliminary to our mar|riage.
I will, when you &s;hall vouch&s;afe me
the honour of your hand, receive it, if
you plea&s;e, from Lady Bidulph; and
as I pre&s;ume it with be agreeable to
you to have the ceremony intirely pri|vate,
that I may, for our dear lit|tle
boy's &s;ake, pre&s;ent you rather as
my acknowledged wife, than as my
new made bride, I will, with the ut|mo&s;t
&s;peed and &s;ecrecy, have &s;uch di&s;|po&s;itions
made, as &s;hall be &s;uitable to
my condition, and your own merit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould like, after we are united,
if you have no objection to it, to pay
a vi&s;it for a while to an e&s;tate I have
<PB N="166" REF="167">
in Ireland; which I have never yet
&s;een, and which I intended to have
looked at, if this event, this happy
event, (and he ki&s;&s;ed my hand) had
not taken place.&endq;</P>
<P>Penetrated as I was, pur&s;ued Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
with a &s;en&s;e of the genero&s;ity and
openne&s;s of his heart, I could not for|bear
rai&s;ing his hand to my lips; he ten|derly
withdrew it from me, as if aba&s;h|ed
at my conde&s;cen&s;ion. He then turned
the di&s;cour&s;e to le&s;s intere&s;ting &s;ubjects,
and after three delightful hours &s;pent with
me, took his leave; not without hav|ing
fir&s;t fixed on Wedne&s;day, next Wed|ne&s;day,
to be the ble&s;&s;ed day that is to
make him mine for ever.</P>
<P>Happy, happy may you be, &s;aid I! you
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> be happy; but let me &s;ee you once
again before you are Mrs. Faulkland: there
are not many hours to come before that
name will be yours. My dear Madam!
&s;aid &s;he, and patted my bo&s;om with her
hand, I hope all is well <HI>here;</HI> &s;he looked
earne&s;tly in my face, and then added, but
you have a noble heart. 'Tis an hone&s;t
one I hope, &s;aid I, a little di&s;concerted
at her manner. Why did &s;he addre&s;s
me thus, my dear? I hope I did not
di&s;cover any thing in my behaviour as if I
repined at her good fortune; if I did,
far be &s;uch a wreched meane&s;s from the
<PB N="167" REF="168">
heart of thy friend. Was it not my own
act to make Mi&s;s Burchell the happy
woman &s;he now thinks her&s;elf? Yet I
own there is &s;omething in Mr. Faulk|land's
conduct which has rai&s;ed my e&s;teem
to admiration. Oh may his future days
be ble&s;&s;ed, el&s;e &s;hall I indeed be wretched!</P>
<P>My mother told Mi&s;s Burchell, it would
give her inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, to be|&s;tow
her in marriage on Mr. Faulkland;
and de&s;ired &s;he would let her know to|morrow
at what time, and place the cere|mony
was to be performed. She an&s;wer|ed,
at her own hou&s;e, as &s;he could be
no where el&s;e &s;o private; and that Mr.
Faulkland would engage for the purpo&s;e
a clergyman, a particular friend of his,
and fellow-collegian, on who&s;e di&s;cretion
he could rely.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Burchell's &s;pirits were too much
exhilarated to let her think of re&s;t;
&s;he &s;taid with us till it was very late,
and having taken occa&s;ion to mention how
grieved &s;he was at the thoughts of lo&s;ing
my &s;ociety, and of the nece&s;&s;ity Mr. Faulk|land
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf under of never
&s;eeing me more, my mother took that
opportunity of gravely entering into the
&s;ubject of matrimonial duties. She high|ly
applauded Mr. Faulkland's re&s;olution
on that head, and told Mi&s;s Burchell, it
ought exceedingly to enhance his merit
<PB N="168" REF="169">
towards her. Let this be a memoran|dum
to you, my dear Madam, &s;aid &s;he,
how &s;acred the bond is to be held that
is now going to unite you: He will not,
you &s;ee, run the hazard of being tempt|ed,
even in thought, to &s;werve from that
faith which he is going to plight to you;
your &s;ituation is delicate, and it will re|quire
the utmo&s;t prudence and circum&s;pec|tion
on your part, to &s;ecure &s;uch an in|tere&s;t
in his heart as he now &s;eems in|clined
to give you. It is not on your
per&s;onal charms that you are to rely, for
&s;ubduing, or pre&s;erving the affections of
&s;uch a man as he is. They alone, you
&s;ee, were not able to effect this; it is to
Mr. Faulkland's honour rather than his
love, that you are now obliged for the
ju&s;tice he has done you: never let this
be out of your thoughts; be grateful,
but let your gratitude have dignity in it;
and by your behaviour convince your
hu&s;band that honour was with you a fir&s;t
motive to wi&s;h this union, love will then
come in with a better grace as a &s;econ|dary
inducement.</P>
<P>The freedom of my mother's ob&s;erva|tions,
and in&s;tructions, I was not &s;urpriz|ed
at, becau&s;e &s;he always &s;peaks her mind;
but the empha&s;is with which &s;he deliver|ed
her&s;elf was unu&s;ual. Mi&s;s Burchell ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her&s;elf as obliged to her, and
<PB N="169" REF="170">
joined intirely in her opinion; I could per|ceive
however &s;he was not plea&s;ed with the
lecture.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Burchell was gone, my
mother told me, &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary
to &s;peak as &s;he had done. Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
&s;aid &s;he, is not <HI>quite</HI> the girl I took
her for; &s;o much mode&s;ty and re&s;erve, I
thought I never had met with in a
young creature before; when &s;he u&s;ed to
&s;peak of Mr. Faulkland, it was with af|fection
indeed, but with &s;uch a nice de|corum
as convinced me of the inno|cence
and purity of her heart. But of
late I have ob&s;erved &s;he has been le&s;s
delicate in her expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s;
&s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate flights have &s;ometimes
broke from her, as I did not think becom|ing
in a young woman, and which indeed
almo&s;t offended me; and this night her
joy has been ungoverned. Great rea&s;on &s;he
has for joy 'tis true; but there are &s;ome
con&s;iderations which ought to have made
her cha&s;ten that joy into a &s;ober, and at
lea&s;t &s;eemingly, moderate &s;atisfaction. She
loves Mr. Faulkland, but let her beware
of di&s;gu&s;ting a man of his &s;en&s;e by too
&s;trong an expre&s;&s;ion of her fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>My mother's ob&s;ervation, and her un|commonly
forcible manner of expre&s;&s;ing
it, &s;truck me prodigiou&s;ly. It is true I
had made the &s;ame remarks my&s;elf, but
<PB N="170" REF="171">
as you know &s;he is not extremely penetrat|ing,
and in general but a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver,
I was the more &s;urprized at what &s;he &s;aid.
Mi&s;s Burchell's behaviour mu&s;t have been
formerly very different from what it now
is, to have made my mother &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
the change. <HI>Some con&s;iderations,</HI> &s;he &s;aid,
ought to have made her cha&s;ten her joy.
Perhaps, &s;he meant no more than that the
young lady, even in the mid&s;t of that joy,
had, upon reflection, cau&s;e for humilia|tion.
I hope, &s;he did not think that her
gaiety on this de&s;ired event affected me,
who had &s;o warmly promoted it. My
mother is too open not to give the full
meaning of her thoughts. This may be
only the &s;ugge&s;tion of my own fancy, yet
it has mortified me. I had but little re&s;t
la&s;t night, and ro&s;e this morning by day|light,
to throw together in writing the
above particulars.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 27.&mdash;Mi&s;s Burchell came not to us
till late this evening; plea&s;ure danced in
her eyes. I whi&s;pered to her, We rejoice
with you, dear Madam, &s;incerely rejoice,
at your approaching felicity; but our pre|&s;ent
&s;tate will not &s;uffer us to keep pace
with you in that gaiety, however ju&s;tifia|ble
it may be from the cau&s;e: re&s;train
your&s;elf a little; my mother will not think
you kind, as we are &s;o &s;oon to part with
you. She &s;miled, and thanking me for
<PB N="171" REF="172">
the hint, immediately compo&s;ed her fea|tures
to &s;uch a decorum (I will not call it
demurene&s;s) that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;|cover
&s;he was agitated by any extraordi|nary
emotion. I own, I was amazed at
the command &s;he &s;o &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed over
her countenance. I was glad, however,
&s;he did &s;o, that my mother might not
have fre&s;h cau&s;e of di&s;like towards her.</P>
<P>She told us, that Mr. Faulkland had
&s;ettled a thou&s;and pounds a year on her,
and that too without ever having inform|ed
him&s;elf of the &s;tate of her fortune; for,
in the hurry of her thoughts, &s;he had ne|glected
to mention it to him: (Generous
man! whi&s;pered I to my&s;elf). She then,
with great gravity, applied her&s;elf to my
mother, and told her &s;he hoped for the
honour of her pre&s;ence, the next morn|ing,
at her own hou&s;e; where the cere|mony
was to be performed, before no
other witne&s;&s;es but her lady&s;hip, and the
gentlewoman, who had been Mr. Faulk|land's
hou&s;ekeeper; and that the follow|ing
day they pupo&s;ed retiring to Mr.
Faulkland's &s;eat in Hartford&s;hire, and after
a &s;hort &s;tay there, to &s;et out for Ireland.</P>
<P>My mother commended Mr. Faulk|land's
diligence, for having &s;o &s;uddenly
di&s;po&s;ed every thing for this important
event, and told our friend &s;he would
not fail to attend her at the appointed time.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="173">
Mi&s;s Burchell's behaviour was ex|tremely
compo&s;ed; &s;he either really was,
or affected to be, extremely &s;orry at part|ing
with me; &s;he could not &s;tay long
with us, &s;he &s;aid, as &s;he had many things
&s;till to &s;ettle in the remaining part of
that evening. On taking leave of me,
I &s;hall not &s;ee you again, worthie&s;t of
women, &s;aid he, at lea&s;t, for many
months; but my love, my re&s;pect, and
my gratitude towards you will be as
la&s;ting as my life. You &s;hall hear oft|en
from me, and be &s;o good as &s;ome|times
to tell me I am not forgotten.
She embraced me with tears in her
eyes, but I thought &s;he tripped down &s;tairs
to her chair, as if her heart was very light.</P>
<P>My mother liked her deportment: &s;he
&s;aid, &s;he believed the flightine&s;s of her
behaviour before, was owing to her be|ing
quite intoxicated with the &s;udden|ne&s;s
of her joy, on &s;o unexpected a turn
of fortune; but that, &s;ince &s;he had time
for recollection, &s;he had recovered her
wonted ba&s;hful and &s;ober air, with which
&s;he u&s;ed to be &s;o delighted. My mo|ther
&s;ays, &s;he will contrive to carry a
rich white brocade gown with her, in
order to &s;lip it on at Mi&s;s Burchell's
hou&s;e; for &s;he would not, on any con|&s;ideration,
appear in mourning on this
joyful occa&s;ion. You know the reverence
&s;he has for omens.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
<HI>June</HI> 28.&mdash;The important event is
over, my Cecilia. Mi&s;s Burchell is now
Mrs. Faulkland. My mother is ju&s;t
returned, and &s;aw the nuptial knot tied.
The lady, &s;he &s;aid, looked very lovely;
and it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve &s;he gave
her hand with all her heart. Mr.
Faulkland's behaviour was polite and
uncon&s;trained; but his attention to his
bride was more gallant than tender;
and his whole deportment was that of
a man who &s;eemed to endeavour at
acquitting him&s;elf with a good grace of
an act of duty, rather than of inclination.
The latter part of the ob&s;ervation is
mine, not my mother's; but I collected
it from certain little particulars, which
&s;he related to me in her own way,
without drawing any inference from them.</P>
<P>He thanked her in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful
manner for the honour &s;he had done
him, and for her former friend&s;hip to
Mi&s;s Burchell; but did not once men|tion
my name. So much the better;
I hope he will forget me.</P>
<P>My mother is mighty alert on the
occa&s;ion, and felicitates both her&s;elf and
me on our having brought about this
very important affair. She joined hear|tily
with me in praying that the new
married pair may be happy in each
other. She is quite reconciled to Mr.
<PB N="174" REF="175">
Faulkland. What a pity it was, &s;aid
&s;he&mdash;and &s;topped; then added, But
every thing is for the be&s;t. I under|&s;tood
her, but made no reply.</P>
<P>They go out of town to-morrow morn|ing;
all happine&s;s attend them!</P>
<P>I expect Sir George will be quite outra|geous
about this marriage. My &s;econd
refu&s;al of his friend, with the addition
of his now being wedded, through my
per&s;ua&s;ion, to a woman my brother ne|ver
could endure, will I fear exa&s;perate
him beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation.
I cannot help it; I have acted agreeably
to the dictates of my duty; that mu&s;t
be my con&s;olation: life is in it&s;elf a war|fare,
<HI>my</HI> life has been particularly &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8th.&mdash;My mother is far from be|ing
well; her &s;pirits have been a little
heightened for the&s;e few days pa&s;t, but
her di&s;order I &s;ee gains ground: the
&s;welling in her legs is returning, and
her re&s;t at night quite broken. I am
hourly habituating my&s;elf to think of her
di&s;&s;olution; or in other words, am pre|paring
my&s;elf for the wor&s;t evil that can
now befal me. I hope I &s;hall find my&s;elf
equal to the trial.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 10th&mdash;Here is a &s;torm for you
my dear; a letter from Sir George. I
wanted &s;uch a thing to rou&s;e me from
the almo&s;t lethargic dulne&s;s that was
<PB N="175" REF="176">
creeping on me. Mr. Faulkland has ac|quainted
him with his marriage. Pray
ob&s;erve his brotherly addre&s;s.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD, <DATE>July 6, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;For I di&s;claim all relation to you.
I have ju&s;t now had a letter from Faulk|land,
wherein I am at once informed
of your having finally rejected him, and
of his being married to Mi&s;s Burchell.
As for the fir&s;t, your own folly be on
your head. You will have time enough
for repentance, and I need wi&s;h you
no other puni&s;hment, than what <HI>will,</HI>
and for me <HI>&s;hall,</HI> be the con&s;equence
of your ob&s;tinate adherence to your
own romantick wild opinions. But
what in the name of blind infatua|tion
could provoke you to urge the
man, to whom you owed &s;uch obliga|tions,
to his de&s;truction? <HI>You</HI> I know
have done it; he could not be &s;o
mad but under <HI>your</HI> influence. You
and my mother I &s;uppo&s;e fancy you
have done a righteous deed; but you
have done what I am afraid poor
Faulkland will have rea&s;on to&mdash;I
will &s;uppre&s;s the &s;hocking word, that
my indignation &s;ugge&s;ted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why was not I made acquainted
with this precious de&s;ign of marrying
my friend to that in&s;inuating little vi|per?
I might perhaps have prevented
<PB N="176" REF="177">
the mi&s;chief; for I cannot think if &s;he
had not impo&s;ed upon you&punc; that you
would have pu&s;hed your chimerical
notions of honour to &s;uch extremities.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps you meant well; but it
has ever been your peculiar misfor|tune
I think, to have your good in|tentions
productive of nothing but evil:
this la&s;t action I fear will be a &s;evere
proof of the truth of this ob&s;ervation.
I warned you in time again&s;t this wo|man,
but my advice has always been
de&s;pi&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will &s;ay no more on the hateful
&s;ubject; what is done is irrevocable:
but I believe you will hardly be able
to an&s;wer it to your&s;elf, if you find
that you have condemned one of the
noble&s;t fellows in the world to the
arms of a pro&s;titute.&endq;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me! my Cecilia, was there
ever &s;uch a barbarian? with what an
implacable aver&s;ion does he pur&s;ue this
poor girl! But what does he mean by
the odious epithet with which he clo&s;es
his horrid letter? Sure Mi&s;s Burchell
merits not that name. Her weakne&s;s
in regard to Mr. Faulkland cannot bring
on her &s;o dete&s;table a charge. If George
knows any thing more of her character
than I do, why did he not tell me &s;o
before? It cannot be; his aver&s;ion to
<PB N="177" REF="178">
her makes him cruel and unju&s;t. He
&s;ays true; I &s;hould not indeed forgive
my&s;elf if I were the means of making
Mr. Faulkland unhappy; and his ob&s;er|vation
would be dreadfully verified, that
all my good intentions produce nothing
but evil, if this marriage &s;hould prove
to be unfortunate.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 20&mdash;I have had a letter from
Mrs. Faulkland. She and her hu&s;band
are arrived &s;afely at his e&s;tate on the
borders of the north of Ireland, within
le&s;s than thirty miles of the capital. It
is a plea&s;ant part of the country &s;he &s;ays,
but as Mr. Faulkland has no hou&s;e there,
they have taken up their lodgings, for
the pre&s;ent, at the hou&s;e of his &s;teward.
Her letter is filled with declarations of
the felicity &s;he enjoys; &s;he &s;ays &s;he
would not change her lot to be the
greate&s;t Queen on earth.&mdash;May &s;he
continue to de&s;erve her happy fortune,
and to render her hu&s;band as &s;atisfied
with <HI>his</HI> lot as &s;he is with <HI>hers!</HI> then
&s;hall I triumph over Sir George for his
vile in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>I have heard from my good Lady
V&mdash;, in an&s;wer to the letter I wrote
her, giving an account of Mr Faulk|land's
marriage. As he had not made
her acquainted with his return to Eng|land,
I knew not whether he had in|formed
<PB N="178" REF="179">
her of this particular; and I find
he had not. As Lady V&mdash;was a
&s;tranger to his former connection with
Mi&s;s Burchell, (with whom I have already
told you &s;he was acquainted, and that
&s;he entertained a very favourable opinion
of her) &s;he expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;plea&s;ure at the
alliance; but &s;aid, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he mar|ried
in a tifft, upon my refu&s;al of him;
for which I gave her &s;uch rea&s;ons as
I had before given Mr. Faulkland, ex|cepting,
tho&s;e which related to Mi&s;s Bur|chell;
which for both their &s;akes, mu&s;t
now be no more mentioned. Lady V&mdash;
&s;ays, &s;he <HI>will not condemn the delicacy of
my &s;entiments, though &s;he owns her wi&s;h
was, that it could have been got over, as
&s;he is &s;ure that Mr. Faulkland can never
be happy with any one but me.</HI></P>
<P>[Here follows an interval of near two
months, in which nothing material oc|curred]</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 13.&mdash;The time approaches,
my Cecilia, when thy friend &s;hall be
poor and de&s;titute. I know thy gene|rous
heart will mere than &s;ympathize
with me in my calamity, from the ag|gravating
reflection that it is not in your
power to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. The account you
have given me of your hu&s;band's clo&s;e
di&s;po&s;ition has too fully convinced me
of this. Nor &s;hould I have mentioned
<PB N="179" REF="180">
my apprehen&s;ions to you at this time,
but that I am bound not to conceal a
thought from the friend of my heart.</P>
<P>Sir George has dropt all corre&s;pon|dence
with us, I have nothing to expect
from him; nor does that mortal live
(your&s;elf excepted) to whom I would on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion be indebted. I have
already &s;ighed too often under the weight
of obligations which I could not repay.</P>
<P>My mother is ha&s;tening apace towards
a better world. She &s;ees her end approach|ing
with &s;uch a calmne&s;s, &s;uch a truly pious
joy, as almo&s;t makes me a&s;hamed of la|menting
her lo&s;s; for what is it in me,
my dear, but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s? 'Tis true, the
lo&s;s of a tender parent, a faithful friend,
at a time when all other comforts of life
are fled, is an evil one would wi&s;h wholly
to avoid, or at lea&s;t to po&s;tpone to the
longe&s;t date po&s;&s;ible: but when I con&s;i|der
<HI>her</HI> welfare, ought I to indulge my&s;elf
in &s;uch a wi&s;h? Her life is already be|come
a burden to her; her infirmities are
painful; and without hope of cure; &s;he
longs to be relea&s;ed, and to receive that re|ward
of her righteou&s;ne&s;s, which cannot
be obtained on this &s;ide of the grave.</P>
<P>If we had a friend, who in compa&s;|&s;ion
to our wants or weakne&s;s, con&s;en|ted
to live with us, though under the
pre&s;&s;ure of years and bodily pain; and
<PB N="180" REF="181">
that friend were invited to a remote coun|try,
with an a&s;&s;urance of recovering
health, of having youth renewed, and
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the riches, power, ho|nours,
and accumulated plea&s;ures that
this world can be&s;tow; &s;hould we not
blu&s;h to own even a with to detain him
from &s;uch a &s;tation? what but a love
of our&s;elves, &s;uperior to that which we
bear to our friend, could &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a
thought? How much more to be de&s;ired
then is the change, to which my mother
looks forward, with an a&s;&s;ured hope!</P>
<P>But there is &s;omething di&s;mal in the idea
of death! 'Tis only our prejudices makes
it &s;o. I have been endeavouring for ma|ny
days pa&s;t to familiari&s;e it to my thoughts,
and to con&s;ider death only as the name
of a region through which my mother
is to pa&s;s, in order to get at that delightful
country to which &s;he is invited, and whi|ther
I &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly follow her. Such is
the pre&s;ent frame of my mind; judge
then, my &s;i&s;ter, if this philo&s;ophy will not
bear me up again&s;t the expected blow
when it falls upon me.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 15.&mdash;'Tis &s;trange, my Ceci|lia,
that this be&s;t of parents, who has al|ways
&s;o tenderly loved me, expre&s;&s;es now
not the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s at the forlorn con|dition
in which &s;he mu&s;t &s;oon leave me.
Her thoughts are employed on higher
<PB N="181" REF="182">
objects, and &s;he &s;eems to have weaned
her&s;elf from all worldly attachments.</P>
<P>I am going from you, my daughter,
&s;aid &s;he to me ju&s;t now, and have no
other legacy to leave you but a pa|rent's
ble&s;&s;ing. Your brother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
all when I die; I wi&s;h you had the
means of enjoying life with comfort; but
you mu&s;t be contented. See that you bear
your lot as becomes you. I perceive your
grief for the melancholy condition to which
I am reduced; but added &s;he &s;miling, I
&s;hall &s;oon be relea&s;ed. Remember how
David behaved on the death of that &s;on,
who&s;e life he had &s;o earne&s;tly be&s;ought
of his Maker: let that &s;erve you as an
example, not to give your&s;elf up to
unprofitable &s;orrow. Bring up your chil|dren
in the principles that I taught <HI>you,</HI>
and God will take care of them; for <HI>I
have never &s;een the righteous for&s;aken, nor
his &s;eed begging their bread.</HI></P>
<P>She &s;aid, &s;he found her&s;elf drow&s;y, and
de&s;ired me to leave her for a while. I have
left her, going I hope to get a little &s;leep;
&s;he breaths with &s;o much difficulty that &s;he
cannot bear to lie down, and never gets
any re&s;t but by &s;natches, as &s;he &s;its in an
arm-chair &s;upported by pillows.</P>
<P>How heavy and ca&s;t down do I feel my
&s;pirits; but I know the wor&s;t&mdash;<HI>that</HI> is
&s;omething.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">
It is all over: and my mother, ble&s;&s;ed
woman! opens not her eyes again but to
a joyful re&s;urrection. Oh, my dear, there
is no terror in death when he &s;eizes us
not unprepared! I went into my mother's
chamber, in about half an hour after
I had quitted it, at her de&s;ire: I found
her leaning back in her chair, her eyes
&s;hut, and a complacent air diffu&s;ed over
her face, which made me hope that her
&s;lumber was &s;weeter, and more profound
than u&s;ual. I &s;at down by her to contem|pleat
her benign countenance; and was &s;ome
minutes before I di&s;covered that &s;he did
not breathe, I took her hand, &s;he had no
pul&s;e; and I &s;oon found that the happy &s;pi|rit
had e&s;caped from its hou&s;e of clay. May
I die the death of the righteous, and my
latter end be like hers. No murmurings,
no, no my &s;i&s;ter, I will be patience it&s;elf!</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 25.&mdash;I have &s;ent the remains
of my venerable parent down to Sidney-Ca&s;tle,
there to be interred with her
ance&s;tors. I wrote my brother an account
of her death on the day it happened,
but have as yet received no an&s;wer. Un|natural
&s;on! but I will not reproach
him; &s;ome accident might have preven|ted
his writing immediately on the re|ceipt
of my letter. He never intirely
for&s;ook the duty he owed his mother,
but he has of late been quite e&s;tranged
from us; his wife, vain, weak and impe|rious,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
governs him totally. I mu&s;t now
begin to look about me for a place
of abode &s;uited to my pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances.
My whole income would not
pay more than half the rent of the&s;e
lodgings in which I have lived with my
dear mother. My poor Patty! I am
grieved for <HI>her.</HI> I begged of her to
&s;eek another mi&s;tre&s;s, who might be a|ble
to reward her merit, and provide
for her as &s;he de&s;erves; but the
worthy affectionate girl told me, it
would break her heart, if I talked of
parting with her. You mu&s;t have a Ser|vant
of &s;ome &s;ort, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, why
may not I do as well as another? If I were
able to make you a proper return, Patty,
&s;aid I, you &s;hould not leave me, but I
cannot afford to pay a &s;ervant of your abi|lities
as you de&s;erve; and I mu&s;t be my
own maid for the future. Never, never,
Madam, cried the hone&s;t creature, bur&s;ting
into tears, while I have hands to &s;erve
you. Let me but attend on you, and the
two dear children; I de&s;ire nothing.&mdash;I
want nothing. Your goodne&s;s has all a|long
&s;upplied me &s;o, that I am &s;ure I
have cloaths enough to &s;erve me during
my life, and if I could not put up with
the &s;ame humble way of living that my
mi&s;tre&s;s does, &s;ure I &s;hould be a pre&s;umptu|ous
wretch! My tears thanked the grate|ful
<PB N="184" REF="185">
girl; and taking her by the hand, I
told her, that I would not talk of par|ting
for the pre&s;ent, but when any thing
worth her her acceptance offered, I &s;hould
then in&s;i&s;t on her embracing it.</P>
<P>I am determined to retire to &s;ome
village at a di&s;tance from London, and
either to take a little cottage to my&s;elf,
or board with my children at &s;ome farm|hou&s;e,
as I &s;hall find mo&s;t convenient.
Fifty pounds a year will be but a &s;len|der
&s;upport for three per&s;ons brought
up in affluence. My little ones indeed
will not now be &s;en&s;ible of the change,
and by the time they are grown up,
they will be &s;o inured to their home|ly
board, that they will not, I hope,
a&s;pire after what cannot con&s;i&s;tently (per|haps)
with virtue, lie within their reach.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 27.&mdash;After paying the ex|pences
of my mother's funeral, di&s;|charging
our lodgings, and &s;ome other
demands, I find my pur&s;e will be &s;o
extremely reduced, that I &s;hall have but
barely enough to keep out want, till
my &s;mall income becomes due to me.
I mu&s;t therefore, for the pre&s;ent, de|fer
putting my &s;cheme into executi|on,
as I am not qualified to under|take
a journey with my little family;
e&s;pecially as I am as yet uncertain what
place to fix on for my re&s;idence; nei|ther
will I afford my brother (though
<PB N="185" REF="186">
I have no rea&s;on to expect any thing
from him) a farther pretence of re|proaching
me, by giving him room to
&s;ay, I left London without con&s;ulting
him, or waiting for his return to it.
I &s;hall therefore look out for a lodg|ing
of a &s;mall price, where I will con|ceal
my&s;elf from every body that knows
me, and wait for Sir George's arrival.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 28.&mdash;How happy you make
me, my ever dear friend, by your
approbation of my conduct, &s;ince my
receiving your la&s;t packet, which came
to my hands late la&s;t night, I am bet|ter
reconciled to my pre&s;ent lot than
I was before I heard from you. I
<HI>could not do otherwi&s;e,</HI> you &s;ay, after
my &s;olemn promi&s;e given to Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
than u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours
to promote her marriage with Mr. Faulk|land.
True; I could not: but I wi&s;h
you had entered more into my &s;enti|ments,
in regard to tho&s;e punctilios,
which, you tell me, you think <HI>might</HI>
have been got over, if that young
woman had been out of the que&s;tion.
I could not help &s;miling at your wi&s;h,
unchri&s;tian as it was; but my dear,
if that <HI>were</HI> to happen, do you think
Mr. Faulkland &s;o void of rea&s;on, nay
of feeling, as after all that has pa&s;t
to per&s;evere? Or if he did, that I
could be &s;o mean as to owe the very
<PB N="186" REF="187">
bread that I and my children &s;hould
eat, to his genero&s;ity? Would you,
my Cecilia, wi&s;h to &s;ee your friend &s;o
humbled? 'Tis not in the power even
of the cold, hard hand of poverty it|&s;elf,
to da&s;h me &s;o low as that would
do. But where is the need of forming
re&s;olutions or even making declarations
about what never <HI>can</HI> happen? I &s;ee
notwith&s;tanding, that you think my
heart has <HI>again</HI> done it&s;elf &s;ome vio|lence:
You know that heart too well
for me to attempt to hide from you
its &s;ecret workings. I own to you hone&s;t|ly
I now feel my own unhappine&s;s in
its full extent. I look back and take a
&s;urvey of the pa&s;t, and cannot help think|ing
that I have had the mo&s;t wayward
fate allotted me that ever woman had.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointment in a fir&s;t love, has, I
think, been ever accounted a grief &s;carce
&s;urmountable even by time: but this can
only be the ca&s;e, where the heart, extremely
vulnerable by nature (like Mi&s;s Burchell's)
&s;uffers it&s;elf to be &s;o intirely immer&s;ed in that
pa&s;&s;ion, that all the other duties of life are
&s;wallowed up in it; and where an indolent
turn of mind, a want of rational avo|cations,
and perhaps of a new object,
all contribute to indulge and confirm
the di&s;ea&s;e. This you know was not my
ca&s;e. I loved, 'tis true; but it was
with temperance; and though my di&s;|appointment
<PB N="187" REF="188">
afflicted me, it did not
&s;ubdue me. I got the better of it, I
think I got the better of it even be|fore
I married; but &s;ure I am, I to|tally
conquered all remembrance of it
after I became a wife. I then laid down
a new &s;cheme of happine&s;s, and was for
a time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; how I was
thrown from this is &s;till bitter to remem|brance.
You well know what I &s;uffer|ed,
when I found my&s;elf deprived of
my hu&s;band's love, and &s;u&s;pected of a
crime at which my &s;oul &s;hrunk. But
it plea&s;ed the ju&s;t God to deliver me
from this heavy misfortune, and I think
the happie&s;t days of my marriage were
tho&s;e which I pa&s;&s;ed with Mr. Arnold
after our re-union. Then it was, I was
thoroughly &s;en&s;ible that the heart <HI>can</HI>
love a &s;econd time, truly and ardent|ly;
but I was &s;oon again plunged in|to
affliction by the death of a hu&s;band
endeared to me more than ever by his
misfortunes. My grief for him was
proportionate to my love. Yet, my
friend, as time is an univer&s;al conque|ror,
it might have healed this wound
as well as the former one; and a few,
a very few years would perhaps have
di&s;po&s;ed me to return Mr. Faulkland's
&s;till unabated pa&s;&s;ion, if a variety of
circum&s;tances had not interpo&s;ed, that
&s;trongly forbad our union. Convinced
<PB N="188" REF="189">
as I was of this, I acted agreeably to
the dictates both of my rea&s;on, and
my con&s;cience, in per&s;uading Mr.
Faulkland to make Mi&s;s Burchell his
wife. I &s;hould have been grieved and
mortified had he rejected her, and I
had determined never to have &s;een
him more. Yet how deceitful is the
human heart! this very act which I la|boured
with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity to accom|pli&s;h,
and on the accompli&s;hment of
which, I had founded, I know not how,
a &s;ort of contentment for my&s;elf, has been
the very means of de&s;troying what little
peace of mind I was beginning to
ta&s;te before. Sure that man was born
to torment me in a variety of ways!
If I was di&s;appointed in my early love,
I had however duty, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of what I then thought &s;uperior worth,
to &s;upport me. If on his account I
&s;uffered cruel and injurious a&s;per&s;ions,
the innocence of my own &s;elf-acquitted
heart bore me up under it: but he
has at length found the way to pu|ni&s;h
me without leaving me any re|&s;ource.
My pride is of no u&s;e, he has
rai&s;ed him&s;elf in my e&s;teem &s;uperior
to every thing. His whole behaviour
&s;o generous, &s;o candid; a love &s;o di&s;in|tere&s;ted,
&s;o fervent; what noble, what
uncommon proofs has he given me
of it! and at length what a triumph|ant
<PB N="189" REF="190">
&s;acrifice has he made of that
over-ruling pa&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ober calls
of rea&s;on and humanity! He has left
me, my dear, to gaze after him
with grateful admiration! and &s;ome|times
perhaps to &s;igh that our fates
rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to meet.
But if I do &s;ometimes &s;igh, it is not
at the advantages of fortune, which I
might have enjoyed with him; no,
no, &s;urrounded as I am with di&s;tre&s;s,
I do not envy Mi&s;s Burchell's afflu|ence
or &s;plendor. If <HI>that</HI> motive could
have had weight with me, I might have
been mean enough not to have acted
as I have done. 'Tis the qualities of
the man's mind I e&s;teem; I think our
&s;ouls have &s;omething congenial in them,
and that we were originally de&s;igned
for each other. And if I believed the
doctrine which teaches us, that there are lit|tle
officious &s;pirits that pre&s;ide over the
actions of men, I &s;hould think that our
two evil geniu&s;es laid their heads toge|ther
in conjunction with Mi&s;s Burchell's
active demon, to thwart and cro&s;s all our
mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I have nothing now left but to pray for
the happine&s;s of one who&s;e lot in this life
he has &s;uffered <HI>me</HI> to determine; and to be|&s;eech
Heaven that he may never &s;tand in
that fatal predicament which Sir George,
with &s;uch outrageous barbarity, marked
out in his vile letter.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
I now return to my&s;elf, and to my pre|&s;ent
&s;tate; which I think I may &s;ay brings
up the rear of my misfortunes. Let the
cha&s;ti&s;ement &s;top here, and I &s;hall bow me
to it with re&s;ignation.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 29.&mdash;Ah, my Cecilia, what
an aggravation is here to the already too
deep regret I began to feel on Mr. Faulk|land's
account! His triumph over me is
now complete!</P>
<P>In &s;orting my mother's papers (as I am
to leave the&s;e lodgings to-morrow) I found
that letter which Mr. Faulkland wrote
to my brother from Bath. You may re|member
I told you my mother had, in her
re&s;entment, flung it to Sir George, and
that, as it happened to fall on the ground,
he had quitted the room in a pa&s;&s;ion with|out
taking it up. My mother, I &s;uppo&s;e,
when &s;he cooled, laid it by, though I dare
&s;ay &s;he never looked into it afterwards.
Read it, and &s;ee by what a fatality we
have been governed.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. Faulkland's letter to Sir G. Bidulph.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>May 9, 1703.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;How you mortify me, my dear Bi|dulph,
when you tell me of the happi|ne&s;s
I lo&s;e by &s;taying &s;o long at Bath!
<HI>The ladies are impatient to &s;ee me,</HI> &s;ay you?
Ah! Sir George, thou ha&s;t &s;poke better
of me than I de&s;erve, I fear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;adly out of humour with my|&s;elf
at pre&s;ent. I have got into a very
<PB N="191" REF="192">
fooli&s;h &s;ort of &s;crape here. My wri&s;t is
quite well, and I &s;hould have thrown
my&s;elf at Mi&s;s Bidulph's feet before now,
but to tell you a &s;ecret, my virtue not
being proof again&s;t temptation, I have
been intercepted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis but a &s;light lap&s;e, however, a fly|ing
affair; neither my honour, nor my
heart in the que&s;tion. A little vagrant
Cupid has contented him&s;elf with pick|ing
my pocket, ju&s;t lightly fluttering
through my brea&s;t, and away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you fallen &s;o low as that, Faulk|land,
&s;ay you? to <HI>buy</HI> the favour of the
fair, No, George, no; not quite &s;o con|temptible
as that neither: and yet,
faith, I did <HI>buy</HI> it too, for it co&s;t me
three hundred pounds; but the lady to
whom I am obliged knows nothing of
this part of her own hi&s;tory; at lea&s;t, I
hope &s;o, for my credit &s;ake. The ca&s;e
in &s;hort is this: an old gouty officer, and
his wife, (a very notable dame; a fine
woman too) happened to lodge in the
&s;ame hou&s;e with me. The man came
hither to get rid of his aches; the lady
of her money, and her virtue, if &s;he has
any, for &s;he is eternally at the card tables.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Under the conduct of this hopeful
guide, came a niece of the hu&s;band's;
an extremely fine girl, innocent too, I
believe, and the be&s;t dancer I ever &s;aw. I
don't know how it happened, but &s;he
<PB N="192" REF="193">
took a fancy to me, which, upon my
word, and I am &s;ure you have no doubts
of me, I was far from wi&s;hing to improve.
You know I always de&s;pi&s;ed the mean
triumph of gaining a heart, for which I
could not give another in return. I &s;aw
with pain her growing inclination for
me, but as we lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e,
and met every day in the rooms, it was
impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid her as much
as I wi&s;hed to do. The aunt I found,
had her eye upon me, and took &s;ome
pains to promote a liking on my &s;ide. I
&s;aw her de&s;ign, and was &s;o much upon
my guard, that &s;he, who I &s;oon found
was an adept in love matters, almo&s;t de|&s;paired
of gaining her ends. The young
lady's inclination however &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e;
a pair of fine blue eyes told me
&s;o every day; and I was upon the point
of flying to avoid the &s;oft contagion,
when an accident happened that totally
overthrew all my good re&s;olutions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I had not &s;een the young lady for two
or three days; I enquired for her, and
her aunt an&s;wered, with a my&s;terious
&s;mile, She is ill, poor thing, why don't
you look in upon her, and a&s;k her
how &s;he does? I replied, if the lady
will permit me, I will do my&s;elf that
honour, and intended literally to have
kept my word, by ju&s;t a&s;king her at her
chamber door how &s;he did.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
&startq;You are very cruel, &s;aid the aunt;
would you per&s;uade me that you don't know
the girl is in love with you? O, your Ser|vant,
Madam; if you think me vain, I
thank you for the reprimand. Come, come,
&s;aid &s;he, this is all affectation, we'll drink
tea with her this evening. Upon my word,
&s;aid I, if I am to believe what you &s;ay, I
think you ought not to de&s;ire me. I am
not blind to the young lady's merit, but
am &s;o unfortunate as not to have it in my
power to make &s;uch returns as &s;he de&s;erves.
I found the occa&s;ion required my being &s;e|rious.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you have not love, &s;aid &s;he, you may at
lea&s;t have a little complai&s;ance. Was there
ever &s;uch a barbarian, not to go and &s;ee a
woman that is dying for him? I promi&s;ed
to bring you, and &s;he expects you. What
is the pretty creature afraid of (patting my
cheek) I'll &s;tay by it all the while. There
was no with&s;tanding this; I promi&s;ed to
wait on her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She knocked at my door about &s;ix o'clock,
and, looking in, a&s;ked if the coy Narci&s;&s;us
was ready? I went with her, and &s;he led
me directly to her niece's chamber. The
young lady looked pale and langui&s;hing,
but very pretty. I was really grieved to
&s;ee her, and enquired, with an unaffected
concern after her health. The tea-things
were &s;et, and I tried to force &s;omething
<PB N="194" REF="195">
like conver&s;ation, but I believe I was rather
formal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When we had done tea, the aunt looked
at her watch, &s;tarted off her chair, &s;aid &s;he
had out&s;taid her appointment with the par|ty
&s;he was to meet at cards, and turning to
me, I hope, Sir, you will have the <HI>Charity</HI>
to &s;tay with my niece; and then hurried
out of the room. I begged leave to hand
her to her chair, intending to take that op|portunity
of &s;lipping away, and re&s;olved
to quit the hou&s;e the next morning. But
the determined gip&s;ey was prepared for this
motion, and in&s;i&s;ting that I &s;hould not &s;tir,
thru&s;t me back from the door, which &s;he
&s;hut, and flew down &s;tairs.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What was to become of me now, George?
my &s;ituation was dangerous, and really cri|tical.
To be &s;hort, I forgot my prudence,
and found the young lady's heart too, too
tender.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I never felt remor&s;e before. I never had
cau&s;e. I accu&s;e my&s;elf of indi&s;cretion, but
I have not the aggravating addition to my
fault of oaths and promi&s;es to fly in my face.
I made none&mdash;love, fooli&s;h love did all,
and led a willing victim to his altar, who
a&s;ked nothing in return for the &s;acrifice &s;he
offered; and received nothing but unavail|ing
repentance on my &s;ide.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not any thing now that would
give me &s;o much plea&s;ure as to find that
<PB N="195" REF="196">
the girl hated me heartily, though I have
given her no cau&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A ju&s;t reparation I cannot make her.
Every thing forbids that thought. I do
not con&s;ider my&s;elf as free; but if I were
&s;o, I am not a &s;educer, and therefore do
not think my&s;elf bound to carry my peni|tence
to &s;uch lengths. The damned aunt
has been the &s;erpent. And here let me ex|plain
to you what I called buying the lady's
favour. You mu&s;t know, the aunt one
night, (the greate&s;t part of which &s;he had
&s;pent at hazard) lo&s;t two hundred pounds;
at lea&s;t &s;he told me &s;o the next morning,
and with tears in her eyes be&s;ought me, in
the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to lend her that
&s;um. She &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould be undone if
her hu&s;band were to know it, and that &s;he
would pay me in a very few days, as &s;he
had as much due to her from different peo|ple
who had lo&s;t to her at play. Though
our &s;hort acquaintance could hardly warrant
her making &s;uch a reque&s;t, I neverthele&s;s
did not he&s;itate, but gave her the money
directly. She meant indeed to pay me,
but it was in a different coin, and this I &s;up|po&s;e
was the price &s;he &s;et on the unhappy
girl's honour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My reflections on this unlucky affair make
me very grave. I have explained my &s;itu|ation
to the young lady, and expre&s;&s;ed my
concern at not having it in my power to be
<PB N="196" REF="197">
any other than a friend to her. She blames
her own weakne&s;s, and her aunt's conduct,
but does not reproach me. She cannot with
ju&s;tice, yet I wi&s;h &s;he would, for then I
&s;hould reproach my&s;elf le&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis a fooli&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, and I mu&s;t get
off as hand&s;omely as I can. Prithee, Bi|dulph,
&s;ay &s;omething to encourage me, and
put me into more favour with my&s;elf. You
have often been my confe&s;&s;or, but I never
wanted ab&s;olution &s;o much as now; nor
ever was &s;o well intitled to it, for I am really
full of penitence, and look <HI>&s;o</HI> mortified,
you would pity me. I am a&s;hamed of
having been &s;urpri&s;ed into a folly; I who
<HI>ought</HI> to have been upon my guard, know|ing
the natural impetuo&s;ity of my own
temper.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t not conclude without telling you,
that this very morning, the precious aunt,
in&s;tead of paying me the two hundred
pounds &s;he had of me before, very mo|de&s;tly
reque&s;ted I would oblige her with
another hundred, to redeem a pair of dia|mond
ear-rings which &s;he had been obli|ged
to part with for the &s;upply of &s;ome
other nece&s;&s;ary demands; and with abun|dance
of &s;mooth &s;peeches, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me,
in a fortnight &s;he would pay me all to|gether,
having notes to that value, which
would then become due to her. I was
&s;uch a booby as to give it her&mdash;Why, fare
<PB N="197" REF="198">
it well&mdash;I never expect to &s;ee a &s;hilling of
it. She thinks, perhaps, there is value
received for it. Vile woman! The affair,
fortunately for us all, has not taken wind;
and for me, the names of both aunt and
niece, may ever &s;tand enrolled among&s;t
tho&s;e of cha&s;te matrons and virgins. The
family quits this place &s;oon, as the old gen|tleman
is better.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thank you for your care, in relation to
my hou&s;e. I hope to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in
a weak or ten days; you are very good in
fixing me &s;o near your&s;elf. Adieu.&endq;</P>

<P>What do you think of this letter, my Ce|cilia,
written in confidence to my brother?
Mr. Faulkland could not conceive it pro|bable
that any body but Sir George &s;hould
ever &s;ee it; he had no rea&s;on therefore to
glo&s;s over any of the circum&s;tances. <HI>Had</HI>

virtue was, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a cen&s;ure on the crime
in gro&s;s, without admitting any palliating
circum&s;tance. But I blame her not; the
excellence of her own morals, made her &s;cru|pulous
in weighing tho&s;e of others; &s;he
read the letter in a cur&s;ory way, and it is
<PB N="198" REF="199">
plain but half of it; prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as &s;he was
before by knowing the material point.</P>
<P>The account was given with levity at the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> mention of the young lady. Then &s;he
under&s;tood he had <HI>bought</HI> her of her aunt;
there is a paragraph which <HI>looks</HI> like it, and
to be &s;ure &s;he attended not to the explana|tion.
Fatal over&s;ight! &s;he read not far
enough to have this matter cleared up. She
took nothing but the bare facts into her ac|count.
A young lady di&s;honoured, her di&s;|grace
likely to be public, then her tenderne&s;s
for the man who had undone her, and that
man rejecting her, and on the point of mar|rying
another. The&s;e were the only points
of view in which my mother beheld the &s;tory.
Her ju&s;tice, her humanity, and her religion
prempted her to act as &s;he did; and her
conduct &s;tands fully acquitted to judgment,
tho' my heart mu&s;t, upon this full conviction
of Mr. Faulkland's honour, &s;igh at recollect|ing
the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I know that the memory of my mother's
own fir&s;t di&s;a&s;trous love wrought &s;trongly on
her mind. She was warm in her pa&s;&s;ions,
liable to deep impre&s;&s;ions, and always ad|hered
&s;trictly to tho&s;e opinions &s;he fir&s;t im|bibed.
Her education had been &s;evere and
reclu&s;e; and &s;he had drawn all her ideas of
mankind from her own father and mine, who
I have been told, were both men of exem|plary
lives. From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, I
<PB N="199" REF="200">
mu&s;t again &s;ay, that I entirely acquit my
dear mother, in regard to her whole con|duct,
however I have &s;uffered by it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 30.&mdash;I am now fixed in a very
humble habitation. Shall I own it to you,
my Cecilia? I was &s;hocked at the change.
A room two pair of &s;tairs high, with a clo&s;et,
and a &s;mall indifferent parlour, compo&s;e the
whole of my apartment. Hither did my
faithful Patty, my two children, and my&s;elf,
remove this day. It put us not to much
trouble, having nothing to take with us but
our wearing apparel, which is all the world|ly
goods of which I am now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When I wrote to Lady V&mdash;, (which was
a day or two before my mother's death) I
mentioned not that &s;he was then in &s;o dan|gerous
a way. I know the genero&s;ity and
good nature of that worthy woman; but I
have already been too much obliged to her
to lay any fre&s;h tax on her friend&s;hip, which
I am &s;ure &s;he would too readily pay, if &s;he
were acquainted with my &s;ituation. I &s;hall
therefore, as long as I can, defer acquaint|ing
her with my mother's death; and when
I do, I &s;hall not give her room to &s;u&s;pect that
my brother has ca&s;t me off, which I have
now too much rea&s;on to believe he has;
otherwi&s;e &s;ure, in more than a fortnight, he
might have found time to write to me, I
neither expect ceremony nor tenderne&s;s from
<PB N="200" REF="201">
him; but the occa&s;ion of my letter demand|ed
&s;ome notice.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 2.&mdash;Patty has ju&s;t now been in|formed,
that Lady Sarah Bidulph is arrived
in town. She met one of their &s;ervants, who
told her that my brother is not come with
her; it &s;eems, they parted on the road. He
is gone to Sidney Ca&s;tle, which is now his,
and Lady Sarah cho&s;e to come to London.
She has, I find, been in London four days,
though &s;he has not yet vouch&s;afed to &s;end
me any notice of her arrival. She could not
be at a lo&s;s where to find me, as I left my
direction at my former lodging, in ca&s;e of
any letter, or me&s;&s;age, coming from any of
my friends; though I de&s;ired the people of
the hou&s;e, not to inform any indifferent vi|sitants
where I was to be found.</P>
<P>Though George has, in his turbulent way,
renounced me, as his &s;i&s;ter, yet &s;ure his wife,
whom I never di&s;obliged, ought not to de|part
&s;o from humanity and common good
breeding, as not to enquire after the &s;i&s;ter
of her hu&s;band, who has an occa&s;ion of
grief &s;o recent, in which &s;he ought to
partake. I &s;hall not however take notice
of this &s;light, but am preparing to &s;end
Patty to her, with an enquiry after her health,
and to know when my brother is expected
in town.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="202">
Patty is ju&s;t returned from her emba&s;&s;y to
Lady Sarah; I will give you the conver&s;ation
&s;he had with her.</P>
<P>Patty &s;ent in her me&s;&s;age, with great
re&s;pect, by a footman, and waited for her
an&s;wer in the hall; though her pretty figure
and genteel mourning dre&s;s had induced the
&s;ervant to a&s;k her into the hou&s;e-keeper's
room.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah was alone in the parlour, and
de&s;ired her to be called to the door. So,
young woman, &s;aid &s;he, your mi&s;tre&s;s de|&s;ires
to know when Sir George will be in
town. I am really &s;urpri&s;ed, after the letter
&s;he received from him, that &s;he can fancy
Sir George means to concern him&s;elf about
her. Do you know her bu&s;ine&s;s with him?
You are in your mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ecrets, I &s;uppo&s;e.
I do not know, Madam, an&s;wered Patty,
what particular bu&s;ine&s;s my lady may have;
but I believe it would be a comfort to her,
to &s;ee her brother in her pre&s;ent melancholy
circum&s;tances. I don't know that there is
any thing uncommonly melancholy in her
circum&s;tances, replied the lady; her mo|ther's
years and infirmities made her death
a thing to be looked for; I &s;uppo&s;e your
mi&s;tre&s;s is not in <HI>want.</HI> My poor inge|nuous
Patty &s;aid, &s;he blu&s;hed at the cruel
indifference with which Lady Sarah &s;poke
this. Not in immediate want, Madam, I
hope; but your lady&s;hip mu&s;t needs think
<PB N="202" REF="203">
&s;he is in a de&s;titute way, with two child|ren,
and but fifty pounds a year in the
world. What do you mean, woman, cried
Lady Sarah? it is impo&s;&s;ible but Lady Bi|dulph
mu&s;t have left money behind her;
Sir George, I am &s;ure, has got nothing but
what &s;he could not keep from him. Patty
an&s;wered, Lady Bidulph, Madam, left no
money behind her more than what was
barely &s;ufficient to defray &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary
expences that occurred immediately after
her death. Well, and &s;o your mi&s;tre&s;s, I
&s;uppo&s;e, after having behaved &s;o ill as &s;he
has done to her brother, expects he &s;hould
provide hand&s;omely for her, and her child|ren;
<HI>Arnold</HI>'s children, for the re&s;t of their
lives. I know not, Madam, returned Patty,
what my lady's expectations are, but I be|lieve
&s;he would be very glad to &s;ee Sir George
before &s;he goes out of town, or at lea&s;t in|form
him of her de&s;ign. What <HI>is</HI> her de|&s;ign,
pray? a&s;ked Lady Sarah. To retire
into the country, Madam, as &s;he has not
wherewithal to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on in London. She
can't do better, I think, &s;aid the Lady.
Where does &s;he live now? My poor maid,
who thought this que&s;tion tended to the
proud woman's calling on, or at lea&s;t &s;end|ing
to me, made ha&s;te to inform her; &s;he
lodges, Madam, at a milliner's, at the cor|ner
of the Hay-market, the left hand as you
turn&mdash;Oh dear! pray &s;top: you need not
<PB N="203" REF="204">
be &s;o particular, I have no de&s;ign of paying
her a vi&s;it in her corner-&s;hop; my only rea|&s;on
for enquiring was, to know whether &s;he
had thought proper to keep tho&s;e expen&s;ive
lodgings her mother was in, in expectation
of Sir George's continuing <HI>her</HI> in them. My
Lady has no &s;uch view, I believe, Madam.
Well, you may tell your <HI>Lady,</HI> that if &s;he
will go out of town with her children, I will
endeavour to prevail on Sir George to allow
her &s;omething. He will pot be in town this
month, &s;o that &s;he need not wait for his ar|rival.
She might, if &s;he would have been
guided by her brother, have been a credit
to her friends, in&s;tead of what &s;he now is.
Patty owns, &s;he was &s;o full of indignation,
that &s;he wi&s;hed at that moment not to have
been a &s;ervant, that &s;he might have reproach|ed
her with her hard-heartedne&s;s. Oh, my
dear, the&s;e are the &s;tings of poverty! It is
not the hard bed, nor the homely board, but
the oppre&s;&s;ive in&s;olence of proud prosperity;
'tis that only which can inflict a wound on
the ingenuous mind.</P>
<P>As for that mean woman, I de&s;pi&s;e her
too much to &s;uffer my&s;elf to be obliged to
her. <HI>She will endeavour to prevail on my bro|ther.</HI>
If his own heart cannot prevail on
him, I di&s;claim her influence; I know &s;he
means not to u&s;e it in my favour; on the
contrary, I make no doubt but &s;he will en|deavour
to irritate Sir George again&s;t me by
<PB N="204" REF="205">
mi&s;repre&s;entations. Her pride makes her
wi&s;h to have an indigent relation out of the
way, yet her avarice would not &s;uffer her to
enable me to retire; and &s;he will make my
continuing here through nece&s;&s;ity, a pre|tence
for &s;till with-holding any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
me. Let it be &s;o; I would rather &s;ubmit to
the mo&s;t abject drudgery, than owe a wretch|ed
dependant exi&s;tence to &s;uch a woman. I
am &s;ure my brother, notwith&s;tanding his re|&s;entment,
if he knew what my &s;ituation
truly is, would not behave with cruelty; but
my mind is not become &s;o &s;ordid, fallen as I
am, as to turn petitioner for relief. But no
more, my Cecilia, let not my fate interrupt
your happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 4th.&mdash;I have had a letter from
Mrs. Faulkland, filled with the overflowings
of a joyful heart. She &s;ays, Mr. Faulkland
is &s;o delighted with the country he is in, and
finds his e&s;tate capable of &s;uch va&s;t improve|ment,
that he thinks of making a longer
re&s;idence there than he at fir&s;t intended:
the rather, as he has &s;ome &s;u&s;picions that his
agent has not acted faithfully by him; and
as he is &s;ure the exten&s;ive plan, that he has
now laid down, will be better executed un|der
his own eye. He purpo&s;es building a
little convenient lodge on a very charming
&s;pot in the center of his e&s;tate, where he
may re&s;ide whil&s;t his works are carrying on;
&s;o that Mrs. Faulkland promi&s;es her&s;elf
<PB N="205" REF="206">
much plea&s;ure, in &s;pending her time partly
there and partly in Dublin. She has alrea|dy
made a large circle of acquaintance, and
be&s;tows high encomiums on the great po|litene&s;s
and ho&s;pitality with which they are
received by all the fa&s;hionable people in the
county.</P>
<P>She knows not of my mother's death; yet
in my an&s;wer to her letter, I cannot avoid
mentioning it. Though I could wi&s;h for
obvious rea&s;ons to conceal it. Mr. Faulk|land
well knows the ruin of our fortune;
and though he cannot &s;uppo&s;e, while I have
a brother living, that I am driven to &s;uch
&s;traights, yet I know what his liberal heart
may &s;ugge&s;t to him on this occa&s;ion, which
might lay me under fre&s;h difficulties.</P>
<P>I have but ju&s;t now appri&s;ed Lady V&mdash;of
the decea&s;e of my dear mother, but have not
in&s;inuated any other grief than the lo&s;s of a
tender parent, and an agreeable companion.
Indeed I have carried my di&s;&s;imulation &s;o far,
as not to de&s;ire this lady to change her ad|dre&s;s
to me, le&s;t, if I gave her my pre&s;ent
direction, &s;he might be led to think, nece&s;|&s;ity
had obliged me to change my former
lodgings for wor&s;e. I &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame pre|caution
towards Mrs. Faulkland, as I have
obtained permi&s;&s;ion from the gentlewoman,
who&s;e hou&s;e I lately left, to have my letters
&s;ent thither: when I go into the country, a
general direction to the po&s;t-hou&s;e may &s;uf|fice.
<PB N="206" REF="207">
I &s;hall now look out for &s;ome little
&s;pot to retire to, where I can &s;upport life on
the cheape&s;t terms. In two months I &s;hall
have my &s;mall pittance due to me, which I
re&s;erve to carry me out of town, and to &s;et|tle
me in my new &s;cheme of oeconomy in
the country. If I could per&s;uade my poor
Patty to quit me, and &s;ee her &s;ettled in &s;ome
eligible &s;ituation, I &s;hould then have no ma|terial
concern to attend to, but the bringing
up my children in the paths of virtue and
humility. Humility, that happy frame of
mind, on which &s;o much of our temporal as
well as our eternal welfare depends.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9th.&mdash;Who &s;hall &s;ay, now is the
mea&s;ure of my griefs complete: Providence,
thou can&s;t inflict no more! O my &s;i&s;ter! in
the mid&s;t of other &s;orrows, I thought not of
one that &s;till remained behind; my children,
my two little angels! both dangerou&s;ly ill.
The &s;mall-pox is their di&s;temper, and of the
wor&s;t kind. The di&s;ea&s;e has been hanging
over them for &s;ome days, and my clo&s;e at|tendance
on them, prevented me from u&s;ing
my pen. The cruel di&s;temper now appears
with the mo&s;t malignant &s;ymptoms. The
elde&s;t always &s;lept with me; I have re&s;igned
my bed to her for the&s;e three la&s;t nights, and
have watched by her. Patty has done the
&s;ame by the younge&s;t. A humane and &s;kil|ful
phy&s;ician attends them, but my reliance
re&s;ts not on him.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
<HI>October</HI> 12th.&mdash;Three days and nights of
&s;orrowful anxiety have at length produced a
little comfort to me. The di&s;temper has
now reached one cri&s;is, whence the phy&s;ician
can form a judgment with &s;ome degree of
certainty, and he bids me hope. Oh if it
were not for that healing word, how could
the wretched drag on exi&s;tence from day
to day? I do, I will hope, for there is a
merciful providence that &s;uperintends his
works.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 21.&mdash;Thank God! thank God!
my Cecilia, the dear babes are out of dan|ger.
Fifteen melancholy days and nights
has their di&s;con&s;olate mother watched by
the poor little &s;ufferers; but I am fully re|paid
by having them re&s;tored to my pray|ers.
They are now able to &s;it up, and
open their pretty eyes which had been clo&s;ed
for many days; and to add to my &s;atisfaction
I think they will not be marked: but they
are &s;till &s;o feeble that it will be at lea&s;t ano|ther
fortnight, before I can think of venturing
their little tender frames out of doors.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician's care and diligence de&s;erv|ed
a greater recompence than I had it in my
power to make him; however what I have
done has reduced me to a &s;ingle guinea.
But this affects me not; I &s;hall make no
difficulty of parting with &s;ome of my now
unnece&s;&s;ary fineries, which neither I nor my
<PB N="208" REF="209">
children probably will ever again have any
preten&s;ions to wear.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22.&mdash;I have felt the wounds of
grief, the pangs of di&s;appointment, and the
&s;mart of indignation; yet was my heart never
more &s;en&s;ibly affected than it was ju&s;t now,
by a circum&s;tance proceeding from a cau&s;e
very different from all the&s;e. I had taken
out of my drawers a few &s;uperfluous orna|ments,
which I de&s;ired Patty to di&s;po&s;e of as
if they were her own, to the woman where
we lodge; being things in her own way of
bu&s;ine&s;s. The poor girl looked at me for
&s;ome time with a grief in her countenance
that pierced me to the &s;oul. There is no
need, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, with her voice almo&s;t
&s;tifled, there is no need I hope as yet for
this. You don't con&s;ider, Patty, &s;aid I, that
the children's weak condition requires now a
more than ordinary attention to their diet;
and I have not &s;ufficient to &s;upply them long
with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they want. I have
no occa&s;ion for the&s;e trifles, and I cannot &s;ee
my little ones droop for want of &s;uch com|fortable
nouri&s;hment as may re&s;tore them to
their &s;trength. Nor &s;hall they want it, Ma|dam,
an&s;wered Patty; don't be angry with
me, Madam, if I beg you will let me u&s;e my
endeavours to &s;upply them. What do you
mean, &s;aid I, I know the goodne&s;s of your
di&s;po&s;ition, but how have you it in your
power? You know, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I am
<PB N="209" REF="210">
pretty expert at my needle; and as our land|lady
has always abundance of work on her
hands, I undertook to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and have
for this fortnight pa&s;t, while I was clo&s;ely
confined to mi&s;s's room, fini&s;hed a piece of
curious work, for which &s;he has this day paid
me thirty &s;hillings. You amaze me, &s;aid I,
I never &s;aw you employed otherwi&s;e than in
your attendance on the child. I was afraid
you would be di&s;plea&s;ed, Madam, &s;he replied,
and always hid my work when you came in|to
the room, which I could ea&s;ily do, as it
was only a fine piece of point which I was
grounding; and as I &s;at up night and day,
I had an opportunity of &s;ticking almo&s;t con|&s;tantly
to it, which enabled me to do in a
fortnight, what to another hand would be a
month's, labour. Now, Madam, with your
leave, I can go on in this manner; and though
perhaps I cannot always earn &s;o much, yet I
am &s;ure I can &s;till procure enough to prevent
your being drove to the nece&s;&s;ity of parting
with your apparel, till we are in a condition
to leave &s;uch an expen&s;ive place as London
is. And do you think, my dear Patty, &s;aid
I, with tears of affection and gratitude in
my eyes, that I will con&s;ent to take the fruits
of your ingenious and hone&s;t indu&s;try from
you? no, no, if you can find time by the&s;e
means to procure a little &s;upply for your own
pocket, do &s;o; but I will not &s;uffer you to
expend a farthing of what you can earn, on
<PB N="210" REF="211">
my account. I &s;aw &s;he looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and
confounded; excu&s;e me, madam, &s;aid &s;he,
but I have made bold to lay out part of the
money already; I thought the poor children
would want a little wine to nouri&s;h them,
and indeed, Madam, your &s;pirits want
&s;ome &s;upport after your long fatigue. I
have bought a few bottles of wine, Madam,
and &s;ome other little nece&s;&s;aries, I hope you
will not take it ill.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed the affectionate creature's hand;
I cannot be angry with you, Patty, for your
goodne&s;s, but &s;uch proofs of it as the&s;e di|&s;tre&s;s
me more than my wants could. I ac|cept
of your kindne&s;s for this time, but in&s;i&s;t
on your not doing &s;uch a thing again. If
there be occa&s;ion for it, I can apply to my
needle as well as you, and would &s;ooner do
&s;o, than part with any of my things, &s;ince it
gives you &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The poor girl was rejoiced at my accep|tance
of her friendly and tender offer, and pro|duced
her little purcha&s;e, which was indeed
both &s;ea&s;onable and u&s;eful.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 23. I had this day a letter from
Lady V&mdash;. I &s;end you a copy of it.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&startq;I condole with you, my dear Mrs. Ar|nold,
on the afflicting lo&s;s you &s;u&s;tained in
your good mother's death. You mention
not any particular con&s;equences from this
accident; but I know, that by Lady Bi|dulph's
death, you are deprived of a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="211" REF="212">
part of your income, and on this
account I have taken the liberty of friend|&s;hip,
to &s;end you a &s;upply, which your fa|mily

&s;ettled upon a better footing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let me know how you and your brother
&s;tand; if he &s;hould not be &s;o kind to you
as he ought, I in&s;i&s;t upon your looking on
me as your banker, who know not how to

<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The &s;upply which Lady V.&mdash;mentioned,
accompanied this letter, and was a bank bill
of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I own to you, my Cecilia, that my fir&s;t
emotions were only tho&s;e of joy, &s;urprize, and
gratitude, for &s;o unexpected and important a
donation; but when tho&s;e were a little &s;ub|&s;ided,
I began to reflect on the nature, and
manner of this noble act of friend&s;hip. I
know Lady V&mdash;is one of the be&s;t women
living; that &s;he is generous, and compa&s;&s;ionate,
and has always honoured me with a particu|lar
regard; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, her
pre&s;ent now comes to me &s;u&s;pected. I believe
I told you, that Lady V&mdash;had retired into
Lanca&s;hire, to live with an only &s;i&s;ter &s;he has
there: this Lady is a widow, and I have &s;ince
been informed, was left with a very nume|rous
young family, and an income &s;carce &s;uf|ficient
to &s;upport them genteelly; they are
<PB N="212" REF="213">
now mo&s;t of them grown up, and all the
girls, of which there are five, unprovided for.
Since Lady V&mdash;'s departure, I have been
told, that it was principally on account of
the&s;e young girls, of whom &s;he is extremely
fond, that &s;he went to re&s;ide with her &s;i&s;ter,
in order to to &s;upport them more agreeably to
their rank; their father having been a gene|ral
officer, and a man of high birth. Lady
V'&mdash;s jointure is a thou&s;and pounds a year;
but as I hear the family make a re&s;pectable
figure in the country, and I am &s;ure Lady
V&mdash;'s fondne&s;s for her nieces, would induce
her to &s;ave what &s;he could, in order to leave
them &s;omething at her death, I cannot recon|cile
it to her prudence, notwith&s;tanding the
liberality of her Spirit, and the friend&s;hip &s;he
has for me, that &s;he &s;hould make &s;o con|&s;iderable
a pre&s;ent, and at the &s;ame time give
me as it were an unbounded letter of credit
on her. Had &s;he &s;ent me the &s;ixth part of
the &s;um, I &s;hould not have doubted its being
only the effects of her kindne&s;s towards me;
and in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as con&s;iderable
a proof of it, as &s;he ought in regard to her
family, to have given to one whom &s;he has
already bound under &s;trong obligations.
But the largene&s;s of the &s;um renders it &s;u&s;|picious;
and to tell you the &s;ecret in&s;pira|tions
of my heart, I fear it comes from a dif|ferent
quarter.</P>

I made Mrs. Faulkland acquainted with
my mother's death, about the &s;ame time that
I informed Lady V&mdash;of it. To neither did
I give the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of my circum|&s;tances,
yet Mr. Faulkland knows they can|not
be happy. He too knows better than
any body, how far Sir George's re&s;entment
may carry him. Is it not natural then, my
dear, to imagine that this man, who is ge|nero&s;ity
it&s;elf, &s;hould have taken this method
of making Lady V&mdash;the channel through
which he conveys his liberality? I am &s;ure it
mu&s;t be &s;o. It is three weeks &s;ince Lady V&mdash;
had the notice of my mother's death; Why
thought &s;he not &s;ooner of reaching out her
&s;upporting hand, if &s;he imagined I &s;tood in
need of it? I gave her no cau&s;e to believe I
did; otherwi&s;e I make no que&s;tion of her
ready friend&s;hip, as far as her abilities would
go: but <HI>&s;he</HI> could not know as well as Mr.
Faulkland, how much my brother was exa&s;|perated
again&s;t me, and therefore could not
&s;uppo&s;e me to be as de&s;titute as I really am.
She de&s;ires to know how my brother and I
&s;tand. This que&s;tion is not Her's; Sir
George, for his own credit, perhaps has not
told Mr. Faulkland what his conduct has
been towards me, but he wants to be in|formed.
Contriving man! I will di&s;appoint
him; nor &s;hall he heap &s;uch obligations on
me as mu&s;t &s;ink me under their weight. I
will not receive this &s;u&s;pected gift of Lady
<PB N="214" REF="215">
V&mdash;'s; but it is a delicate point, and, whil&s;t
I refu&s;e, I mu&s;t take care not to offend. I
will &s;end Lady V&mdash;her bill back again, but
in &s;uch a manner as to &s;hew her, I refu&s;e her
gift for no other rea&s;on but its being too
valuable.</P>

<OPENER>To Lady V&mdash;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;You oppre&s;s me, my dear and ever ho|noured
Lady V&mdash;, by a genero&s;ity and
friend&s;hip that knows no bounds. Why
will you force me to appear proud, or un|grateful,
by refu&s;ing the favours of &s;o true
a friend? But, my dear Madam, do not be|lieve
me either the one or the other. Had
you &s;ent me a trifling token of your love,
you would have been convinced of my re|&s;pect
for you, by the thankfulne&s;s with
which I &s;hould have accepted it; but do
not &s;eek to humble me &s;o far, my good
Lady V&mdash;, by heaping favours on me,
which I can never have a pro&s;pect of re|turning.
With equal re&s;pect and grati|tude,
permit me, Madam, to return your
too con&s;iderable pre&s;ent. I cannot, in
honour, receive a liberality, which I am
&s;o little intitled to; and the le&s;s, as Ju&s;tice
now demands, that your bounteous heart,
<PB N="215" REF="216">
&s;o diffu&s;ive in its genero&s;ity, &s;hould a little
re&s;train it&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot &s;ay that my circum&s;tances are
as happy as they have been; yet have I,
I thank Heaven, accommodated my mind
to them. My brother has not been in
town &s;ince my mother's death; but I am
not without hope that he will make my
&s;ituation ea&s;y. On this account, I know
my dear Lady V&mdash;will the more readily
pardon my refu&s;al of her obliging offer,
and believe that her goodne&s;s is not be|&s;towed
on an unthankful heart.&endq;</P>

<P>In this letter I re-inclo&s;ed her bill, and
have &s;ent it off. Did I not well, my Ceci|lia?
If, as I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, this pre&s;ent
came from Mr. Faulkland, I &s;hould never
endure my&s;elf, had I retained it. If it
&s;hould have really come from Lady V&mdash;
her&s;elf, I mu&s;t &s;till approve my own con|duct.
The &s;um (circum&s;tanced as &s;he now
is) was certainly to much for <HI>her</HI> to be|&s;tow,
or <HI>me</HI> to receive; and in the manner of
my refu&s;al, I think I have in&s;inuated this,
with as much deference for Lady V&mdash;'s judg|ment
as I could &s;hew. She will &s;ee my mo|tive,
and I think that will be a &s;ort of touch|&s;tone,
whereby I &s;hall di&s;cover, from her

Patty has, by her enquiries, heard of a

about fifty miles off, where my children and

<P><HI>October</HI> 26.&mdash;The di&s;mal ta&s;k is fallen up|on
me again, to keep an account of our me|lancholy
days. My dear &s;uffering lady is
&s;eized with a fever, and confined to her bed.
She orders me, Madam, to write down every
thing as it happens. Lord keep us! there is
nothing but &s;orrows in this world: I am &s;ure,
at lea&s;t, my poor lady has had her full &s;hare
of them. Her clo&s;e attendance on the chil|dren,
and the lo&s;s of re&s;t for &s;o many nights,
has brought this new affliction on her. Oh,
Madam, the lo&s;s of health is a grievous
thing, even where there are riches: what
mu&s;t it be in my lady's circum&s;tances? But
&s;he has the patience of Job him&s;elf. To be
&s;ure, Madam, her trials are enough to put
another be&s;ide them&s;elves; but I think my
lady's courage encrea&s;es with her troubles.
I was obliged, to-day, with an aching heart,
to di&s;po&s;e of a fine lace head of my lady's.
I heard her &s;ay, it co&s;t &s;ixty pounds; but,
though it never was was wet but once, I got
but fifteen for it, and this, perhaps, may all

<P><HI>November</HI> 3.&mdash;My lady has had a letter this

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Mrs. Arnold.</OPENER>
<P>&startq;You cannot imagine, my dear Mrs. Ar|nold,
how unea&s;y you have made me, by
your not accepting of the bill I &s;ent you,
becau&s;e I too well know the occa&s;ion you
have for it. But, &s;ince you <HI>have</HI> refu&s;ed
it, (and I know the &s;incerity and &s;trength
of your re&s;olutions) I mu&s;t not take to my|&s;elf
the merit of this friendly and generous
offer; too liberal indeed, as you, with
great delicacy, hinted, for <HI>me</HI> to make.
To let you into the &s;ecret at once, and that
your gratitude may be directed to the pro|per
place, it was from our noble friend Mr.
Faulkland that I received that &s;um, with in|&s;tructions
to &s;end it to you, as from my&s;elf,
for he well knows you would not have ac|cepted
it from him; but, &s;ince I &s;ee you
determined to reject it, as coming even
from me, I think I ought, in ju&s;tice to him,
<PB N="218" REF="219">
to place this act of friend&s;hip to the right
account.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I had a letter lately from Mr. Faulkland,
wherein he tells me, that having heard,
from your corre&s;pondence with Mrs. Faulk|land,
of Lady Bidulph's death, he fears
you are, by her lo&s;s, rendered extremely
unhappy in your circum&s;tances. He is not
a &s;tranger to the lo&s;&s;es you formerly &s;u&s;tain|ed
in your fortune, and he &s;ays be&s;ides, he
knows your brother's warm temper &s;o well,
that he is apprehen&s;ive he will carry an un|rea&s;onable
re&s;entment he has taken up &s;o
far, as to deny you that brotherly kindne&s;s
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which you have a right to
expect from him.&endq; &startq;If this &s;hould be the
ca&s;e&endq; (he adds) &startq;what mu&s;t be Mrs. Ar|nold's
&s;ituation?&endq; &startq;He then conjures me
to convey to you that trifle (as he called it)
under the &s;anction of my own name, that
being the only one from which he had a
hope it would not be refu&s;ed; and he far|ther
&s;aid, that if you &s;hould be prevailed
upon, on account of the friend&s;hip which
he knew there was between you and me,
to accept of my &s;ervice, he would contrive,
from time to time, to furni&s;h you with
&s;uch little &s;upplies, as might make you
ea&s;y, 'till Sir George and you &s;hould be
on better terms. Now, my dear Mrs.
Arnold, you have the truth of this whole
affair. I own it was with great reluctance I
<PB N="219" REF="220">
lent my name to impo&s;e on you, but, as it
was &s;o much for your benefit, I overcame
my &s;cruple.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I could wi&s;h your extreme nicety had not
forbid you to accept this offer: I have rea|&s;on
to be angry with you on this account;
yet, my amiable &s;agacious friend, perhaps
you had your doubts. Be that as it will,
remember you &s;aid you would not have re|fu&s;ed
a &s;mall token of my love; I wi&s;h I could
&s;end you one worthy of your acceptance,
and the love I bear you; we &s;hould then
&s;ee who&s;e punctilio &s;hould get the better.
As it is, I &s;end you a very &s;mall token,
which I in&s;i&s;t on your taking, if you have
the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for it; if this &s;hould be
the ca&s;e, I know the candour of your heart,
and that you will be too ingenuous to grieve
me by a refu&s;al.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope Mr. Faulkland will not be angry
with me for betraying his &s;ecret; But what
would it now avail to keep it? I would have
<HI>you,</HI> as well as my&s;elf, know his worth.
Oh how I lament&mdash;but it is to no pur|po&s;e

adver&s;ity&mdash;.&endq;</P>

<P>My Lady's &s;pirits were greatly affected by
reading this letter; &s;he wept bitterly, and
was &s;o ca&s;t down all day, I was afraid it
<PB N="220" REF="221">
would make her di&s;order much wor&s;e. The
good Lady V&mdash;inclo&s;ed a bill of fifty
pounds in it. My Lady &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t not re|fu&s;e
it, but would thank her lady&s;hip when|ever
&s;he was able to take a pen in her hand.
God knows when that will be; for though
&s;he &s;truggles with her illne&s;s, it &s;till gets the
ma&s;tery. The two young mi&s;&s;es mend but
&s;lowly; they do not gather the lea&s;t &s;trength,
and one of them has &s;uch a weakne&s;s in her
eyes that &s;he cannot bear the lea&s;t light.
Indeed, Madam, this is a mo&s;t melancholy
family. I pray to God night and day to
keep me in my health, more for their &s;akes
than my own; for I think it would quite
break my heart if they &s;hould want my at|tendance,
and I &s;hould not be able to give it
to them.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 6.&mdash;I write on, Madam, as I
am ordered, though I have but little to &s;ay,
in the confinement of a di&s;mal &s;ick room,
where I never &s;ee any body but a doctor and
an apothecary: but my lady is unwilling to
let this packet go, till &s;he is able her&s;elf to
tell you (with her own hand) that &s;he is bet|ter,
for fear my dull account &s;hould make
you unea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 7.&mdash;There is &s;uch changes and
turns in my lady's di&s;order, that we do not
know what to make of it. One while we
think &s;he is a little better, and then again
the next hour &s;he &s;eems much wor&s;e than be|fore.
<PB N="221" REF="222">
The doctor would have a con&s;ultation,
though my lady is quite again&s;t it; but the&s;e
doctors love to bring in one another. My
Lady V&mdash;'s pre&s;ent came in good time,
but if they go on at this rate it will not
la&s;t long. My lady &s;aid to me to-day, Patty,
one would think that 1 was of great con&s;e|quence,
and mighty happy, by this bu&s;tle
to pre&s;erve my life; but there is the tie
(pointing to the two children); for their &s;akes
I mu&s;t try to get well.</P>

<P><HI>December</HI> 25.&mdash;I am now able, my dear,
to rea&s;&s;ume that ta&s;k, once the mo&s;t plea&s;ing

gilded all my days. The &s;cene is now
changed; and I think I have nothing the
&s;ame about me, but the feelings and affec|tions
of my mind. You cannot imagine, my
Cecilia, how I am altered; you would not
now &s;ay, that you envied my white and red;
you would hardly know me, and it is not to
be wondered at, preyed on as I have been for
near two months by a &s;low but tormenting
fever. It is with difficulty that I hold my
pen, but my willing hand obeys my heart
<PB N="222" REF="223">
when it would pour it&s;elf out to thee. I have
made a &s;hift to &s;crawl a few lines to my good
Lady V&mdash;, to thank her for her kindne&s;s.
I could not refu&s;e it; it would indeed have
been di&s;ingenuons, con&s;idering the footing
on which &s;he put my acceptance of it. I
&s;hould have been driven to extreme &s;treights,
if it had not been for her pre&s;ent, confined
as long as I have been to the langui&s;hing bed
of &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 26.&mdash;Patty heard to-day that my
brother has been in town &s;ome time, but he
takes no notice of me. I have not a rela|tion
in the world but him&s;elf. He could
not &s;ure be &s;o cruel, if he knew all. But
Lady Sarah keeps it from him; &s;he thinks
perhaps I am &s;lunk into &s;ome ob&s;cure corner,
where &s;he leaves me to di&s;tre&s;s. Sir George
is not of a &s;avage nature, yet his humanity
is not &s;trong enough to &s;eek out the afflicted.
His pride too I know is gratified by having
me out of the way of ob&s;ervation, and &s;o
long as I do not call upon him, I find he will
not enquire after me.</P>
<P>The winter is now &s;o far advanced, and I
am in a condition &s;o extremely weak, that
I cannot, till the &s;pring advances a little,
think of taking my flight to my peaceful re|treat
in the country. I look eagerly forward
to the time of my enlargement; &s;uch I may
call it, for indeed, my dear, my &s;pirits
are quite exhau&s;ted with my long confine|ment
<PB N="223" REF="224">
in a little clo&s;e lodging in this irk&s;ome
town.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 27.&mdash;The gentlewoman with
whom I lodged in St. Alban's-&s;treet, told
Patty who went to her hou&s;e to-day to en|quire
if there were any letters for me, that
there have been, at different times, &s;everal
people of my former acquaintance to look
for me; but I do not find that one enquiry
has come from my brother. I had given
the gentlewoman in&s;tructions not to tell any
&s;tranger where I lodged. I believe this cau|tion
was needle&s;s, there are few who give
them&s;elves the trouble to trace out the &s;teps
of the unhappy; and I dare &s;ay, that tho&s;e
whom common form obliged to pay me a vi|&s;it
of condolence on my mother's death, were
none of them much hurt at the di&s;appoint|ment
of not finding me.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 30.&mdash;I have been laying down a
little &s;ort of plan for my future life. I told
you the terms I could live upon with the
farmer whom Patty found out for me; but
as I cannot expect to be boarded at &s;o cheap
a rate when my children are grown bigger,
I have been devi&s;ing the means how to en|large
my &s;canty income again&s;t the time
that our wants mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e:
for I am firmly re&s;olved my kind Lady
V&mdash;&s;hall never augment the debt I al|ready
owe her. You know, my dear, I am
pretty dexterous at my needle; the woman
<PB N="224" REF="225">
where I lodge deals in embroidery, which
is much in fa&s;hion, and I think I have
not &s;een any, though &s;he pays largely
to her artificers in this way, equal to &s;ome
pieces of my own work. Now, my Cecilia,
I have re&s;olved to apply my&s;elf to this when
I get into the country. I &s;hewed the woman
a &s;mall fire-&s;kreen wrought by me when I
was a girl, the &s;ame which I remember my
poor Mr. Arnold accu&s;ed me of neglecting for
my Horace, and which had never been made
up; &s;he &s;aid the work was &s;o curious, that
&s;he would give any price for &s;uch a hand.
Patty is well &s;killed in this &s;ort of work too,
and as I find &s;he is determined not to quit
me, I mu&s;t, in return, endeavour not to let
the poor girl be too great a &s;ufferer for her
kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I think we &s;hall between us be able to do
a good deal, and my landlady has promi&s;ed
to receive and di&s;po&s;e of our work for a &s;mall
con&s;ideration, as fa&s;t as we can &s;end it to her;
which we &s;hall have con&s;tant opportunities of
doing.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine how plea&s;ed I am
with my &s;cheme. Patty is in raptures at
the thoughts of her being permitted to con|tinue
with me. I would even now &s;et about
my project if my health would allow me,
but alas! my Cecilia, I am &s;till &s;o feeble,
I am not able to &s;it up more than an hour or
two at a time; and cannot walk a-cro&s;s my
<PB N="225" REF="226">
narrow room without help. Fre&s;h air and a
little gentle exerci&s;e would I am &s;ure, more
than any thing, contribute to re&s;tore my
&s;trength; but the means to procure the&s;e,
are not conveniently within my power; &s;o
that I mu&s;t wait that &s;low, but generally &s;ure
remedy, patience.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 10.&mdash;I have a wonderful incident
to relate to you! you, my Cecilia, I know
will join with me in admiring and prai&s;ing
God for his gracious providence!</P>
<P>This morning I was but ju&s;t ri&s;en and got
down into my little parlour, when Patty
came to tell me, a man de&s;ired to &s;peak with
me. I immediately ordered him to be ad|mitted.
Patty accordingly introduced the
per&s;on, who had &s;tood in the entry while &s;he
was &s;peaking to me. He &s;eemed to be a
man between forty and fifty years old, mean
in his apparel, though clean. I nodded to
my maid to leave the room, which when &s;he
had done, I civilly demanded of the &s;tranger
his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I was &s;tanding when he entered the room,
and continued doing &s;o while I &s;poke to him,
not thinking from his appearance that he
was intitled to &s;it down with me. You know
I am not proud, but there is a &s;ort of u&s;uage
e&s;tabli&s;hed, which we naturally fall into.
The man who had advanced &s;ome &s;teps into
the room, looked over his &s;houlder as if for
a chair; &s;o I under&s;tood the motion, and ac|cordingly
<PB N="226" REF="227">
&s;at down my&s;elf, and bad him do
&s;o too. He did, and with an air as if he
con&s;idered the civility to be only what was
due to him.</P>
<P>I believe, Madam, &s;aid he, though you
do not remember me, that you cannot be
ignorant of your having had a relation of
the name of Warner, who went to the We&s;t-Indies
about five and twenty years ago. I
an&s;wered, I do remember to have heard of
&s;uch a per&s;on.</P>
<P>You &s;ee that unfortunate man before you,
he replied; I am your near relation, Madam,
your father was my mother's only brother:
I have been very unhappy, I lo&s;t, in my re|turn
to England, what almo&s;t five and twen|ty
years indu&s;try had &s;craped together: the
&s;um was but a moderate one, yet &s;ufficient
to have &s;upported me decently for the re|mainder
of my life. I a&s;ked him, how it
happened? I began, &s;aid he, to grow &s;ickly
abroad, and was told that my native air
might re&s;tore me. This advice &s;o well a|greed
with my own inclinations, which were,
for a long time pa&s;t, bent upon returning
home, that I took the fir&s;t opportunity of a
&s;hip bound for England; but we were un|luckily
met by a French privateer, who &s;trip|ped
me of every thing but the cloaths on
my back, and &s;et me on &s;hore on the coa&s;t
of Spain, whence I begged my pa&s;&s;age to
England, having nothing to &s;upport me but
<PB N="227" REF="228">
a few &s;hillings, part of a collection, made
for me and my fellow &s;ufferers, among&s;t
&s;ome Engli&s;h gentlemen.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he &s;poke, I thought I could di&s;|cover
a likene&s;s in his face to my father.
He was reckoned extremely to re&s;emble his
&s;i&s;ter, the mother of this unhappy Mr.
Warner; &s;he was a fine woman, and I had
&s;een her picture. His &s;tory was credible;
and I had no rea&s;on to doubt the truth of
what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>And here I will give you a brief account
of what occa&s;ioned this unfortunate relation
to be thus long an alien from his family.</P>
<P>His mother, as you have ju&s;t now heard,
was my father's &s;i&s;ter, who threw her per|&s;on
and her fortune away upon a broken of|ficer.
This act di&s;obliged my father &s;o
much, that from the time of her marriage,
to the hour of her death, he never would
&s;ee her. Her hu&s;band died, when this their
only child was about nine years old; the
poor mother &s;urvived him but a &s;hort time,
and the orphan boy was left to my father's
mercy. I have often heard him &s;ay he was
very unlucky, and never could be per&s;uaded
into a love of his book; he was, however,
put to &s;chool, and my father be&s;towed the
&s;ame expence on his education, as if he had
been his own &s;on. When he was about &s;ix|teen
years old, as he wrote a good hand,
and had a great capacity for figures, he
<PB N="228" REF="229">
bound him apprentice to a merchant, in
which &s;ituation he had been above a year,
(and during that time he had made &s;everal
elopements, and was with difficulty recon|ciled
to his ma&s;ter, through my father's me|diation)
when he committed &s;uch a mi&s;de|meanour
in his ma&s;ter's family, as obliged
him to ab&s;cond. Accordingly he &s;tole un|known
to any body, on board a &s;hip bound
to the We&s;t-Indies, of which his ma&s;ter was
partly owner, where he hid him&s;elf, and
nobody could tell what was become of him,
'till my father, about nine months after his
departure, received a letter from him, dated
from Jamaica, wherein he begged pardon of
him, and his ma&s;ter, for his elopement,
told him, that he had been taken into a
merchant's compting-hou&s;e, and declared,
that he meant, by his diligence and good
behaviour, to make amends for his pa&s;t ill
conduct. This was the only letter my fa|ther
or any of his friends ever had from him.
He an&s;wered it, but had no return; nor
could he, from repeated enquiries, made
two or three years after, learn any thing of
him; &s;o that all his relations concluded him
dead.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars I had heard before from
my father, and his relation perfectly agree|ing
with them in every circum&s;tance, I could
have no doubt but that he was the man.
Sir, &s;aid I, I very well remember to have
<PB N="229" REF="230">
heard your &s;tory; your likene&s;s to my father,
who was the image of your mother, leaves
me no room to que&s;tion your being the Mr.
Warner, of whom I have &s;o often heard:
you are indeed my near relation, and it
grieves my heart to &s;ee you in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s;
and the more &s;o, as I have not the ability I
could wi&s;h to a&s;&s;i&s;t you; but we will talk o|ver
more particulars after breakfa&s;t. I rang
the bell, and ordered Patty to get &s;ome cof|fee.
While we were at breakfa&s;t, I a&s;ked
my new-found kin&s;man by what means he
had di&s;covered me &s;o &s;oon? (for, by the
way, I &s;hould have told you that he &s;aid he
had been arrived but two days in London).
He an&s;wered, that one of the Engli&s;h gen|tlemen,
who had been kind to him at Ca|diz,
had given him a letter to a gentleman in
London, for whom he was to leave it at a
coffee-hou&s;e in Pall-mall; that as he was de|livering
it, he perceived another letter lying
on the bar, directed to Sir George Bidulph.
The two names &s;truck him, remembring
them to be tho&s;e of his cou&s;in. His uncle,
he &s;uppo&s;ed, was dead; but he determined
to enquire who that gentleman was, and if
he found it to be my brother, to apply to him
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He had &s;oon an opportunity
of being &s;atisfied; my brother happened to
come in his chariot to the door, ju&s;t as Mr.
Warner was going out; he knew the arms,
and had &s;ome recollection even of his fea|tures.
<PB N="230" REF="231">
It was pa&s;t three o'clock, &s;aid he,
and I heard Sir George direct his &s;ervant
home. I concluded he was going to dinner,
and that the morning was the propere&s;t time
to call on him, and having informed my&s;elf
where he lived, I accordingly went ye&s;ter|day
morning.</P>
<P>He &s;topped, and &s;ipped his coffee for
&s;ome time without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>And did you &s;ee him, Sir? Yes, Madam,
I &s;aw him, and heard him too. He has got
a fine hou&s;e, and &s;eems to have every thing
very elegant about him. When I was let
into the hall, I de&s;ired the footman to ac|quaint
his ma&s;ter that a Gentleman, newly
arrived from the We&s;t-Indies, wanted to
&s;peak with him, being commi&s;&s;ioned by Mr.
Warner, a relation of his, to enquire after
him. The footman went up &s;tairs, and re|turning
pre&s;ently, a&s;ked me if I brought a
letter from the gentleman I mentioned. I
&s;aid, No, but I had &s;omething to &s;ay to
him.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant, after delivering this me&s;&s;age,
came half way down the fir&s;t flight of the
&s;tairs, and leaning over the bani&s;ters, he
bid me walk up. I found your brother, and
his lady (I &s;uppo&s;e) in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, at
breakfa&s;t. There was tea and chocolate on
the table. I bowed very re&s;pectfully; the
lady &s;carce moved her head; your brother
&s;aid, Your &s;ervant, Sir, and viewed me from
<PB N="231" REF="232">
head to foot, but fixed his eyes earne&s;tly on
my face. The footman who introduced me
had withdrawn. Sir, &s;aid I, have you quite
forgot me? I remember you well. He an|&s;wered
he&s;itatingly, and with a change of
countenance that boded me no good, I pro|te&s;t,
Sir,&mdash;I&mdash;I know nothing of you.
&startq;Have you forgot your cou&s;in Ned Warner?&endq;
He looked at his wife, and &s;he at him; he
forced a &s;mile at her, which &s;he returned,
without knowing for what. &startq;I do remem|ber
there was &s;uch a one related to the fa|mily,
whom we all &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, as
for recollecting his per&s;on&mdash;'tis really &s;o
long ago&mdash;that I&mdash;can't &s;ay I do.&endq; All this
while he let me &s;tand, he was lolling in an
ea&s;y chair, and had a di&s;h of chocolate in
his hand, of which he &s;ipped and &s;poke to
me by turns His wife was feeding a mon|key
that was perched on her &s;houlder.</P>
<P>I am indeed more altered than you, Sir
George; the hard&s;hips which I have under|gone,
and my long re&s;idence in a warmer
climate, may readily account for that; but
have you no traces of my features? no recol|lection
of my voice? I have carried you
many times in my arms. &startq;Sir, I do not
di&s;pute the <HI>identity</HI> of your per&s;on, but I
&s;hould be glad to know your commands
with me.&endq; <HI>Commands</HI> I have none, Sir:
the poor mu&s;t entreat, not command.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">
I then proceeded to tell him my unhappy
&s;tory in the &s;ame words I ju&s;t now gave it to
you. His lady &s;eemed not to mind me, but
kept talking to her marmou&s;et. He li&s;ten|ed
to me, but with &s;o much impatience in
his looks, as quite aba&s;hed me. I was &s;till
&s;tanding, but a little to take off the auk|wardne&s;s
of my po&s;ture, I had ventured to
re&s;t one arm on the back of a chair.</P>
<P>When I had done &s;peaking, your brother
got up in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, to which he
&s;eemed to have been working him&s;elf up
during the time I took to explain my&s;elf.
He whi&s;ked away the chair on which I was
leaning, and walked to the other end of the
room; then turning to his lady, Is not this
a pretty fellow to force his way in upon us,
by a &s;ham &s;tory of a me&s;&s;age from a rela|tion?
and now truly, by way of an agree|able
&s;urprize he turns out to be that very
relation come a begging in his own proper
per&s;on. Sir, &s;aid I, I a&s;k your pardon for
the liberty I took to gain admittance to you;
but you will be the more inclined to excu&s;e
me, if you plea&s;e to con&s;ider that it was out
of re&s;pect to you that I would not in the
mean appearance I now make, acknowledge
my&s;elf to any of your &s;ervants; for the
&s;ame rea&s;on I imagined, that had I not &s;ent
a me&s;&s;age which I was in hopes would have
a little intere&s;ted you in my favour, I might
have been ordered to &s;end up my bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="233" REF="234">
by your footman, which would, I thought,
have been quite improper. You might have
writ, &s;aid he, interrupting me. Ah Sir,
(&s;haking my head) if I <HI>had</HI>&mdash;and I &s;topped
&s;hort. &startq;You might not have been much
the better for it, Is that what you would
&s;ay? (with a contemptuous half &s;neer.)
In &s;hort, Sir, I can do nothing for you; what
is it that you expect I <HI>&s;hould</HI> do?&endq; I do not
mean to be a burden on you, Sir, I replied, I
was bred to bu&s;ine&s;s, I write a good hand,
and under&s;tand accounts. I hope to get into
&s;ome merchant's hou&s;e; but in the mean
time I am &s;tarving. I am an utter &s;tranger
here though in my own country. I ob&s;erv|ed
he had &s;lipped his hand into his breeches
pocket, and &s;eemed to be feeling for a bit of
money. Sir George, &s;aid the lady (who had
ob&s;erved him as well as I) 'tis to no purpo&s;e
to give any thing to the&s;e &s;ort of people;
a&s;&s;i&s;t one, and They will &s;end another to
you, and &s;o there is no end of &s;uch claims.
Your brother withdrew his hand from his
pocket, as if checked by his lady's looks.
&startq;Sir, it is not in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t you.&endq; I
then a&s;ked him if you were living, and
where I could find you? for though you
were not born when I left England, I heard
afterwards that Sir Robert Bidulph had a
daughter. Your brother replied peevi&s;hly,
he knew nothing of you, as you preferred
the friend&s;hip of &s;trangers to that of your re|lations.
<PB N="234" REF="235">
He then rang the bell, and, call|ing
his man to dre&s;s him, went out of the
room, without ca&s;ting a look at me. I ven|tured
to a&s;k his lady your name (if you had
changed it) and where you lived. She told
me your name, but &s;aid &s;he knew not where
you lodged, adding, I might &s;pare my&s;elf
the trouble of enquiring you out, for to her
knowledge you could do nothing for me.</P>
<P>I took my leave; but enquiring of a foot|man,
whom I found in the hall, he directed
me to St. Alban's Street, where you for|merly
lodged. I went there, and it was
with difficulty that I could prevail on the
woman of the hou&s;e, to tell me where you
now lived; but my nece&s;&s;ities made me ur|gent,
and I waited on you this morning,
Madam, to make my di&s;tre&s;s known to
you; but I am afraid the information I had
from your &s;i&s;ter-in law, concerning you, has
but too much truth in it. As he &s;poke this,
he ca&s;t his eyes round my meanly furni&s;hed
parlour, looked at the poor equipage of my
tea-table, and again &s;ipped his unfini&s;hed
and now cold di&s;h of coffee.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, when my &s;i&s;ter informed you
that I was poor, it is certain &s;he &s;poke truth;
I am not however, I thank God, <HI>&s;o</HI> poor,
but that I can &s;pare you a little; if you will
take a cheap lodging near me, I will &s;upply
you with enough to pay for it; and if you
can eat as I and my little family do, you
<PB N="235" REF="236">
&s;hall be welcome to us every day, till &s;ome|thing
can be done for you. I &s;ee but very
few people; but I will &s;peak to &s;uch as come
in my way, to try to have you recommended
to &s;ome one for employment. I then put my
hand in my pocket, and taking out five &s;hil|lings
(all the &s;ilver I had) I put it into his
hand: Sir, you may owe &s;ome little trifle
where you have &s;lept the&s;e two nights, I fear
your lodging has been but poor, but if this
will not di&s;charge it, tell me freely.</P>
<P>He &s;uffered me to drop the &s;hillings into
his unclo&s;ed hand. He fixed his eyes ea|gerly
on my face; but in&s;tead of replying
to what I &s;aid, he only cried out, Good
God! good God! and undoing two or three
buttons at his brea&s;t, he &s;obbed as if his bo|&s;om
was bur&s;ting. I was affected with his
gratitude, and tried to di&s;per&s;e the tears that
mounted to my eyes. I wi&s;h I could weep,
&s;aid he, but I can't; and may tho&s;e be the
la&s;t tears that ever you &s;hall have occa&s;ion to
&s;hed! My worthy, my generous, my pious
relation! God forgive me for trying &s;uch a
heart, but I will reward it, amply will I re|ward
your goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>He then drew a red letter-ca&s;e out of his
bo&s;om, and, opening it, he put a bill into
my hand for two thou&s;and pounds on the
Bank of England. Think, my dear, how
I &s;tared at &s;uch a vi&s;ion! Sir, you amaze
me! was all I could &s;ay. I beg your par|don
<PB N="236" REF="237">
don for deceiving you, &s;aid he, but it was
with a good intent. I &s;uppo&s;e it is needle&s;s
to tell you that I am not that poor forlorn
wretch that I repre&s;ented my&s;elf to you.
Hear the real truth of my circum&s;tances.
You &s;ee before you (of a private man) one
of the riche&s;t &s;ubjects in the&s;e dominions.
You have heard that my &s;etting-out was no
other than that of a common writing clerk
in a merchant's compting-hou&s;e at Jamaica;
from whence I wrote twice to your father,
but never had any an&s;wer. I interrupted
him to tell him, I had heard my father &s;ay,
he had got one letter from him, and had
writ to him in return, and afterwards made
many enquiries after him, without &s;ucce&s;s.
Perhaps he might, &s;aid he, but I never re|ceived
it, nor heard of any enquiries made,
which piqued me &s;o, that I re&s;olved never
to write again. In a little time I made my|&s;elf
&s;o u&s;eful to my ma&s;ter, that he grew ex|ceedingly
fond of me; and having no heir
but an only daughter, who, it &s;eems, had
conceived an inclination for me, though
without my &s;u&s;pecting it, but which her
father had by &s;ome means di&s;covered, he
frankly made an offer of her to me in mar|riage;
with an a&s;&s;urance of leaving me all
that he was worth at his decea&s;e, and an im|mediate
proffer of entering into partner&s;hip
with him. The only return he reque&s;ted
on my part, was to change my name, and
<PB N="237" REF="238">
a&s;&s;ume his, which was Collet. I made no
&s;cruple of complying; for though my re|gard
to the young lady had never ri&s;en to
what is commonly called love, I yet thought
her, in all re&s;pects, an unexceptionable
match. I married her; my patron punc|tually
fulfilled his promi&s;e, and at the end
of three years I found my&s;elf, by his death,
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate. The
following year I lo&s;t my wife in childbed of
her fir&s;t child, who died with its mother.
The changing my name was probably the
occa&s;ion of my not being found out by tho&s;e
employed to enquire after me; and I, per|haps,
ought now to acknowledge my&s;elf
carele&s;s in not acquainting my friends with
my good fortune.</P>
<P>I had &s;uch uncommon &s;ucce&s;s in trade,
that my wealth increa&s;ed amazingly. In
about five years after the decea&s;e of my
fir&s;t wife, I married the widow of a mer|chant,
with whom I got an immen&s;e for|tune.
This lady I truly loved. She was
an amiable creature. I had one &s;on by her,
a fine youth, and we lived happily together
for twelve years; at the end of which it
plea&s;ed God to take from me both wife and
child. Poor man! his tears began to &s;low
here. He proceeded. After this lo&s;s, my own
life began to grow tire&s;ome to me; I had
more riches than I knew what to do with,
and had no-body to leave them to; my
<PB N="238" REF="239">
health began to decline; I grew weary of
the place, partly to divert my melancholy,
and partly through affection to my native
country, to &s;ee England once more. I &s;et|tled
my affairs in the be&s;t manner, &s;ent
con&s;iderable &s;ums of money over before me,
and brought a large one with me. During
my voyage the whim took me, that I would
enquire privately after your family, and pre|&s;ent
my&s;elf to you as I have done, in order
to make trial of your di&s;po&s;itions, re&s;olving,
according as I found you worthy of it, to &s;hare
my fortune among&s;t you, as I knew I had no
other relations in the world.</P>
<P>I have been in England above a month.
The fir&s;t thing I did, was to go down into
Wilt&s;hire, where I was &s;oon informed, that
your father and mother were dead, and that
your brother was married and re&s;ided for the
mo&s;t part in London; you, I was told, had
been married and was a widow, but I could
learn no more about you. On my return
to town, I &s;oon found where your brother
lived, and had the plea&s;ure to hear a good
character of him; but I had determined to
make my own experiment on him, and I
did intend, had he received me ever &s;o
kindly, to have made the &s;ame experiment
on you, before I di&s;clo&s;ed my plot to either
of you.</P>
<P>I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the&s;e old cloaths on
purpo&s;e, and what the &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;cheme
<PB N="239" REF="240">
has been you know. Your brother, nar|row-hearted,
inhuman wretch! I blot for|ever
from my thoughts: it will be the better
for you, though I have more than enough
for you both.</P>
<P>Your kindne&s;s, I tell you again, my va|luable
relation, I will repay an hundred|fold.
Accept of that bill in your hand for
your pre&s;ent u&s;e. I am &s;ure you want it;
and accept of it only as an earne&s;t of my
future friend&s;hip towards you. That bro|ther,
in affluence him&s;elf, who could &s;ee
his &s;i&s;ter, <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;i&s;ter want, mu&s;t have left
all regards to ties of blood, and 'tis no
wonder that I, &s;o much further removed in
kindred, met with &s;uch treatment at his
hands.</P>
<P>See, my Cecilia, what an amazing turn
of fortune! what could I do but lift up my
eyes, as I did my heart, in &s;ilent adoration
of that God, who is a father to the fatherle&s;s,
and defendeth the cau&s;e of the widow!</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before I could frame my
mind to di&s;cour&s;e on ordinary &s;ubjects. I
gratefully accepted my cou&s;in's noble pre|&s;ent.
He enquired minutely into my &s;itu|ation;
there was no need of concealing any
thing from him, nor did I attempt it. He
was very inqui&s;itive as to my brother's beha|viour
towards me. I told him the whole of
it; he was even bitter in his invectives
again&s;t him and Lady Sarah. But, &s;aid
<PB N="240" REF="241">
he, I will have my revenge on them; I will
make you triumph over him, and that proud
up&s;tart his wife. What lodgings you are in,
my poor creature! is this your be&s;t room?
I told him I had nothing but that and a bed-chamber
where my children and I lay, and
a clo&s;et for my maid. He de&s;ired to &s;ee the
children; and I had them both brought in.
He ki&s;&s;ed them tenderly; poor babes! you
have a cur&s;ed uncle, but you have a very
good mama; and I will take care of you
all.</P>
<P>I will dine with you to-morrow, &s;aid he;
let us eat a comfortable mor&s;el together,
and, for your life, not a word of what has
pa&s;t to any body. He then took an affec|tionate
leave of me, and departed&mdash;Let
me here lay down my pen, and wonder at
my fate!</P>
<P>I have got into a flow of &s;pirits, my dear.
What &s;cenes of happine&s;s might now open
upon me, if happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in riches
alone? but no, no, it does not. My heart,
broken by vexation, cannot recover its tran|quillity
&s;o &s;oon. Yet is there room for joy,
joy &s;pringing from a rational, from a hu|mane,
from a commendable motive; and I
will a little indulge it. I can now in part
return the va&s;t obligation I owe Mr. Faulk|land,
as far at lea&s;t as relates to pecuniary
debts. I can now repay many-fold the kind|ne&s;s
of my good lady V&mdash;. I can provide
<PB N="241" REF="242">
for my affectionate worthy Patty. I have
the delightful pro&s;pect of giving my child|ren
an education &s;uitable to their birth;
and, if my life is prolonged, of &s;eeing them
honourably and happily &s;ettled in the world.
I &s;hall have the glorious power of diffu&s;ing
benefits! Oh, my dear, 'tis good for me,
that I have been in trouble; it has &s;o en|larged
my charity, that I feel tran&s;ports
which pro&s;perity is a &s;tranger to, at the bare

to have the heart &s;o improved?</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 11th.&mdash;My new-found relation
dined with me to-day, according to pro|mi&s;e.
Patty had provided two di&s;hes of the
be&s;t things in &s;ea&s;on, and dre&s;&s;ed them ad|mirably;
I need not tell you in what &s;atis|faction
Mr. Warner and I enjoyed our little
chearful meal. He had &s;ent me in the morn|ing
a hamper of excellent wine, and &s;eemed
to reli&s;h his bottle with an extraordinary good
gou&s;t.</P>
<P>When Patty had carried the children up
&s;tairs, and we were left alone, he told me,
that he had been that morning looking out
for a hou&s;e for me; you mu&s;t quit the&s;e
lodgings directly, and &s;ubmit a little to my
management; for I <HI>will</HI> mortify your pal|try
brother and his wife. You &s;hall have
as hand&s;ome a hou&s;e as his, and better fur|ni&s;hed
too, or I'll know why. You mu&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="243">
know, I mean to &s;et you out like a dutche&s;s,
and you &s;hall roll by that worthle&s;s puppy's
door in a better equipage than his minx is
carried in. But I do not intend to live with
you, as well as I love you; for though I am
an old weather-beaten fellow, you are young
and hand&s;ome, and the world I know is
full of &s;candal. I &s;hall therefore content
my&s;elf with a lodging &s;ome where in your
neighbourhood, and come and &s;ee you now
and then. I thanked him for the prudence
of his con&s;ideration, but begged he would
re&s;train his genero&s;ity, and &s;uffer me to live
in that moderate &s;tate, which, if I had ever
&s;o much riches, would be my choice. Don't
oppo&s;e me, coz; &s;aid he, pray don't. I
<HI>mu&s;t</HI> have my way in this; I have &s;et my
heart upon it. You &s;hall <HI>blaze</HI> for a while
at lea&s;t; when I have had my revenge, you
may live as you plea&s;e afterwards. I was
unwilling to contradict him in his odd hu|mour,
yet was very much afraid of the con|&s;equences
of <HI>blazing,</HI> as he called it, all at
once. But, dear Sir, &s;aid I, what will the
world think of my emerging thus from ob|&s;curity
into the &s;plendour you talk of? tho'
you do not live with me, as I am &s;till young,
may it not give room for cen&s;ure? bu&s;y
people will pry into the &s;ource from whence
I draw my affluence, and envy will not be
backward in putting wrong con&s;tructions on
<PB N="243" REF="244">
an appearance, by which it will be &s;o much
excited.</P>
<P>He li&s;tened, looking me earne&s;tly in the
face; then, nodding his head, with a very
grave countenance, &s;aid, You are a &s;en&s;ible
woman, coz, and I commend your pru|dence,
but I mu&s;t have my will for all that.
I could not forbear &s;miling at his manner;
and going on, if, &s;aid I, I were to enter
again into publick life with a moderately
genteel appearance only, no-body's curio&s;ity
would be excited, as it might ea&s;ily be &s;up|po&s;ed,
that my brother had enabled me to
&s;upport a decent figure in the world&mdash;I
&s;oon found that I had made u&s;e of a wrong
argument, which put my friend into a vio|lent
pa&s;&s;ion. A fiddle-&s;tick for you and your
brother too, &s;aid he? do you think I will
let that whelp have the credit of what <HI>I</HI>
mean to do for <HI>you?</HI> no, no, &s;et your heart
at re&s;t about that; what <HI>I</HI> do, all the world
&s;hall know, and my rea&s;ons for it too. I'll
have my own way; there is no hurt, I hope,
in providing for a near kin&s;woman, that is
left to &s;tarve by a &s;till nearer relation, I make
you my heir, look you, and I'll &s;pread it all
over the town. Is there any harm in that?
God knows, I have no more ill in my heart
than one of your children; but I am a little
re&s;enting may be, &s;o &s;ay no more of it. I
found Mr. Warner was pretty po&s;itive, there|fore
thought it the wi&s;e&s;t way to in&s;i&s;t no
<PB N="244" REF="245">
farther upon the argument; but told him, I
would &s;ubmit entirely to his di&s;cretion. It
will be be&s;t for you, &s;aid he, con&s;ider me as
your father, and I will <HI>be</HI> a father to you. He
then told me, that he had been trying to
get a hou&s;e for me near my brother's, that
I might <HI>no&s;e</HI> him, as he called it; but that,
as there were none empty in the &s;quare, he
had fixed on a very hand&s;ome one in an ad|joining
&s;treet. I did not like the furniture,
&s;aid he, &s;o I ordered it out, and have be|&s;poke
new of an upholder, who promi&s;es
me, in a week or ten days at farthe&s;t, to
have every thing completely fitted up. In
the mean time I can't bear to &s;ee you in
this &s;orry room; poor &s;oul! how long have
you been here? I told him near four months,
and that, with his permi&s;&s;ion, I would con|tinue
in the&s;e lodgings till the hou&s;e was
ready, as it was not worth while to change
them for &s;o &s;hort a time. Well, &s;aid he,
you may do as you will for that; I'll &s;ee
that every thing is to your &s;atisfaction. He
took his leave, with an affectionate &s;hake by
the hand.</P>
<P>How miraculous is all this, my dear! this
me&s;&s;enger of good tidings, is he not &s;ent to
me by Providence? As I found he intended
not to make a &s;ecret of his de&s;igns in my
favour, I was in ha&s;te to divulge the joyful
news to my friends. I have accordingly
writ to my Lady V&mdash;, giving her an ac|count
<PB N="245" REF="246">
of the wonderful revolution in my af|fairs;
and I intend, as &s;oon as I can fix
upon &s;ome curious pre&s;ent worth her ac|ceptance,
to make her a large return for
her favours. I have al&s;o acquainted Mrs.
Faulkland of the happy turn in my fortune,
and I de&s;ign a magnificent pre&s;ent for her
as &s;oon as I have time to prepare it. To
neither of the&s;e ladies have I hinted at my
brother's behaviour, either to my&s;elf, or
Mr. Warner. I have made the good wo|man,
with whom I lodge, &s;tare wonderfully
at the relation, I could get nothing from
her but exclamations of a&s;toni&s;hment, her
hands and eyes lifted up, &startq;Good God!
Lord ble&s;s us! what &s;trange things come
about! what luck <HI>&s;ome</HI> people are born
to! and this was your <HI>own, own</HI> cou&s;in, that
you never &s;et eyes on before? my good|ne&s;s,
what a &s;warthy gentleman he is! but
tumbling in gold, I warrant him. It
would be long before &s;uch good fortune
would happen to me, though I have a
cou&s;in beyond &s;eas too.&endq; I could plainly
&s;ee, that this poor woman envied my pro|&s;perity,
though &s;he tried to congratulate me;
but it is the le&s;s to be wondered at, as &s;he
knew not, that I was born to any better pro|&s;pect,
than that of working for my bread in
a two pair of &s;tairs room.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 15.&mdash;I have not &s;een my hone&s;t
kin&s;man the&s;e four days; but he &s;ent me a
<PB N="246" REF="247">
note to inform me, that he was bu&s;y in &s;ee|ing
every thing put in order in my new
hou&s;e; and, that he ab&s;tained from vi&s;iting
me out of <HI>di&s;cretion;</HI> this word he marked,
the more to impre&s;s his full meaning. He
&s;ays, I &s;hall not &s;ee any thing, till all is
ready; neither has he yet &s;o much as told
me, the &s;treet where I am to live. I find
he <HI>will,</HI> as he him&s;elf &s;ays, have his own
way.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 22.&mdash;Now, my Cecilia, I may
rea&s;onably hope, that my afflictions are at an
end: as far as wealth can promote felicity,
that felicity is mine.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t &s;ettled with my landlady, and
having paid her for her lodgings, made her
a pre&s;ent, a little to reconcile her to my
pro&s;perity, when a new chariot, mo&s;t &s;u|perbly
gilt, &s;topped at my door; a black
and a white footman in rich laced liveries
behind it. One of the&s;e brought me a note
from Mr. Warner, who informed me, that
he had &s;ent my <HI>own</HI> equipage to carry me
home, where I &s;hould find him waiting to
welcome me to my <HI>own</HI> hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Patty &s;eemed to have got wings to her
feet; &s;he flew up to me with the welcome
notice, and begged of me to ob&s;erve from
the window, that the &s;ervants were in our
own family livery; with this difference,
that the lace was &s;ilver, in&s;tead of what we
u&s;ed to give.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248">
On expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urpri&s;e at this, Patty
told me, that Mr. Warner had, at his &s;econd
vi&s;it, enquired of her, as &s;he let him out,
what liveries we u&s;ed to give, but bid her
not mention it to me; which &s;he &s;aid &s;he
would not do, as &s;he gue&s;&s;ed, he meant to
&s;urpri&s;e me. But this was not all; he had
been &s;o minutely correct, as to have the
Arnold arms in a lozenge, elegantly painted,
on the doors; what the&s;e were, he was at
the pains of informing himfelf el&s;ewhere.
My Patty, almo&s;t frantick with joy, hurried
the two children down &s;tairs, and &s;tuck
them up in the chariot, telling them both
it was their own, as &s;he put them into it;
but the poor babes fell a crying, and were
not to be pacified by the novelty or finery
of the thing, till I came to them. She
&s;taid behind, to &s;end our little baggage after
us, and I drove to my new hou&s;e in Pall|mall;
where I found my generous benefac|tor
waiting, as he had promi&s;ed, to receive
me.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear, he is a princely man! &s;uch
grandeur, &s;uch elegance! he led me through
every room, where wealth and magnificence
were di&s;played, even to profu&s;ion. From
top to bottom there is not the &s;malle&s;t arti|cle
wanting, that luxury it&s;elf can imagine.
The carpets, &s;kreens, cabinets, and an
abundance of fine china, are beyond com|pari&s;on
more beautiful than any thing of
<PB N="248" REF="249">
the kind I have ever &s;een. 'Tis but eleven
days &s;ince my kin&s;man mentioned his de&s;ign
to me, and you mu&s;t believe he has been
indefatigable in his diligence, &s;ince he has
left nothing for me to do, but at once to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;plendid man&s;ion.
All the nece&s;&s;ary dome&s;ticks are hired, and
ready in their re&s;pective &s;tations; and I am
already as much &s;ettled in a few hours, as
if I had lived here &s;o many years.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner told me, that, as a trifle
would not be &s;ufficient to keep up every
thing in proportionable &s;tate about me, he
intended to allow me three thou&s;and pounds
a year. This appointment, &s;aid he, you are
to con&s;ider as your own property, and ju&s;t
call upon me as you would on your &s;teward.
I am &s;ure you will employ it well, you gave
me a proof of that in <HI>your five &s;hillings.</HI> You
need not be afraid of being too profu&s;e in
your charities; when I die, you will find
your&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of continuing
them.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, long may you live to feel
and rejoice in the ble&s;&s;ings which <HI>your</HI> boun|ty
will, through me, I hope, draw down on
us both. I leave you to enjoy your&s;elf, &s;aid
he; but I am impatient till your brother
knows what he has lo&s;t by his hard-hearted|ne&s;s.
He cannot long be ignorant of it,
Sir, replied I; but indeed I flatter my&s;elf,
that he is not quite &s;o much to blame, in
<PB N="249" REF="250">
regard to me, as we have both imagined.
You &s;ee he &s;eemed to know nothing of my
&s;ituation, when you enquired after me, and
even threw out &s;omething like a reproach
for my having withdrawn my&s;elf, without
acquainting him where I was; I am very
&s;ure Lady Sarah never informed him of
my having applied to her&mdash;It was his
duty to have enquired you out, &s;aid he;
did he not know you were poor? He
knew, &s;aid I, that my circum&s;tances were
very much &s;traightened; but he did not
know <HI>how</HI> much. Well, well, an&s;wered
Mr. Warner, it is good in you to excu&s;e
him, but <HI>I</HI> know him to be a narrow-hearted
poltroon. He took his leave, and
&s;aid he would &s;ee me &s;oon again, having
taken lodgings for him&s;elf in my neighbour|hood.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 23.&mdash;I begin to doubt, my Ce|cilia,
whether I am really awake or not!
'Tis all enchantment! I am afraid my old
kin&s;man is a wizard..&hellip;&hellip; I have
been talking to, and examining my &s;ervants,
to &s;ee if they are real living people, or only
phantoms; I look at, and handle the rich
furniture of my apartments, to try if it be
&s;ub&s;tantial!&mdash;'Tis all &s;o&mdash;every thing real&mdash;
I beg my cou&s;in's pardon, for &s;u&s;pecting him
of &s;orcery; I believe he deals in no charms,
but that all-powerful one&mdash;money.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251">
Now, my &s;i&s;ter, what a &s;pacious field is
there opened before me! Three thou&s;and
pounds a year! How many hearts will it be
in my power to make glad! and I will make
many glad.</P>
<P>&startq;O Lord God, who ha&s;t &s;howered down
thy ble&s;&s;ings in abundance on my head,
vouch&s;afe me &s;uch a portion of thy grace,
that I may become an humble in&s;trument
of thy mercy, to tho&s;e whom the rod of
adver&s;ity has laid in the du&s;t. Teach me
&s;o to u&s;e this thy bounteous favour, that
<HI>Thy</HI> honour, not <HI>my</HI> worldly de&s;ires, may
be promoted; that <HI>Thy</HI> prai&s;e, not <HI>my</HI>
pride, may be exalted. And if, O Lord,
thou ha&s;t cho&s;en me to be the di&s;pen&s;er of
thy fatherly kindne&s;s to the afflicted that
cry unto thee, quicken in my heart &s;uch
diligence, humility, and integrity, as may
render me not unworthy of the important
tru&s;t. But if, O my God! thou ha&s;t &s;ent
riches only to be a trial of my &s;trength,
un&s;upported by thee; be merciful, take
them from me, and re&s;tore to me that
poverty, which fir&s;t taught me to know
my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Upon my knees I have poured out this
prayer to the Almighty, and it is the fervent
wi&s;h of my &s;oul that he would grant it.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 26.&mdash;You will &s;mile, my dear,
as I did, in pity of the meanne&s;s of poor
<PB N="251" REF="252">
Lady Sarah; but proud people are always
mean. I have been here but four days, yet
I find &s;he has already heard of my meta|morpho&s;is.
Indeed &s;he could hardly do
otherwi&s;e, &s;o near her as I am. Mr. War|ner
has been very urgent with me to drive
out in my new chariot; this I readily com|plied
with, as both the children and I wanted
air and exerci&s;e, and ye&s;terday we drove
to Hide Park. I did not, however, go at
the hour when there is mo&s;t company, but
I conclude I was &s;een either by Lady Sarah
her&s;elf, or by &s;ome one who told her; for
this morning, prodigious! &s;he &s;ent her wo|man
to me with a me&s;&s;age. I had her cal|led
up &s;tairs, and enquired very civilly after
my brother and his lady.</P>
<P>She told me, that Lady Sarah &s;ent her hum|ble
&s;ervice to me, and was very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed
that &s;he had not heard from me in &s;o
long a time; that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I was gone
out of town, but as Sir George &s;eemed un|ea&s;y
that I never wrote to him, her lady&s;hip
had &s;ent her to enquire for me at my old
lodgings in the Hay Market, from whence
&s;he had been directed to me here; and that
&s;he was ordered to tell me, that her Lady had
talked to my brother about the affair that I
knew of, and that Sir George would act
agreeably to her reque&s;t, if I would call or
write a line to him.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">
I found the woman had been in&s;tructed
to feign an entire ignorance, on her Lady's
part, of the change in my circum&s;tances; but
I was re&s;olved to let her &s;ee I had detected
this paltry artifice. I could ob&s;erve, that
the &s;ervant, though &s;he endeavoured to avoid
it, eyed every thing in my apartment with
&s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity; and I concluded, that
Lady Sarah had &s;ent her for no other purpo&s;e,
but to &s;atisfy her&s;elf, from her maid's ac|count,
whether the report &s;he had heard
concerning me was true. Tell your Lady,
&s;aid I, &s;he needed not to have been at the
pains of framing &s;uch a me&s;&s;age, to have
gratified her curio&s;ity; my hou&s;e is open
to any one who has a mind to look at it,
even to Lady Sarah her&s;elf. You &s;hall &s;ee
it all over, and may report to her Lady&s;hip,
what my cou&s;in Warner's bounty has done
for me; and &s;he may then judge, whether
I &s;tand in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he now pre|tends
to offer me. The woman looked
aba&s;hed, and, though &s;he &s;eemed inclined to
a&s;k que&s;tions, was a&s;hamed to do &s;o. This
was that very &s;ervant, who had &s;o unce|remoniou&s;ly
led me up the back &s;tairs, when
I went to vi&s;it her Lady; but I appeared in
a quite different light to her now: I rang
the bell, and ordered a footman to <HI>&s;hew her
the hou&s;e.</HI> She curt&s;ied in &s;ilence, and with|drew.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
What a poor creature is Lady Sarah!
Mr. Warner called upon me before her wo|man
went away. I told him the whole
pa&s;&s;age. Oh! how he chuckled, and re|joiced,
&s;hrugging his &s;houlders, and rub|bing
his hands! He wanted to &s;ee the &s;er|vant,
but I was afraid he would be too
&s;trong in his in&s;ults, and turned him from
the point.</P>
<P>He told me, he invited him&s;elf to dine
with me; and accordingly he favoured me
with his company; and &s;taid during the
greate&s;t part of the evening. He is a man
of a &s;trong natural &s;en&s;e, though he is care|le&s;s
of improving it. He has pa&s;&s;ed his
life in bu&s;ine&s;s, and in acquiring riches. He
does not let me into the particulars of the&s;e,
though he is, in other re&s;pects, very com|municative
and entertaining. There is a
whim&s;ical vein runs through his conver&s;a|tion.
He now, for the fir&s;t time, de&s;ired
me to give him the particulars of my life
from my childhood, which he had but a
partial account of at different times, from
my&s;elf. I took up my &s;tory at the earlie&s;t
period of my life, wherein any thing inte|re&s;ting
had occurred, and traced every cir|cum&s;tance
minutely to the hour he fir&s;t &s;aw me.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily &s;ee, that he had a tender
&s;ympathizing heart, for he was moved to
tears more than once during my relation;
<PB N="254" REF="255">
nor was he a&s;hamed of them, for he &s;uffered
them to run down his cheeks, whil&s;t he li&s;|tened
with mute attention to my &s;tory. He
prai&s;ed Mr. Faulkland highly, &s;aid he was
a man after his own heart, and de&s;erved the
be&s;t woman in the world. I wi&s;h you had
married him, &s;aid he, &s;uch a princely fel|low
de&s;erves a princely fortune. He owned,
my brother had &s;ome rea&s;on to be nettled at
my refu&s;al of &s;uch a man. Our &s;ex, &s;aid
he, have not &s;uch <HI>chimaera</HI> notions as you
women have; but &s;till that does not excu&s;e
his &s;ordidne&s;s.</P>
<P>I took this opportunity of telling Mr.
Warner, that my brother did not really
know the very great di&s;tre&s;s I was in, and
that I had rea&s;on to believe, from the gene|ral
tenor of Lady Sarah's character, that &s;he
had either concealed it from him, or made
mi&s;repre&s;entations of my ca&s;e; doubtle&s;s &s;he
had not informed him to what &s;traights I
was reduced immediately upon my mother's
death; and who knows but Sir George,
having left me for a while to feel the effects
of that re&s;entment, with which he had
threatened me in his la&s;t letter, &s;till meant
to &s;hew him&s;elf a brother; for if he were
ignorant, as I am willing to believe, of that
particular which I have mentioned, he could
not &s;uppo&s;e that I was driven to ab&s;olute
want; and from Lady Sarah's in&s;inuations,
perhaps he thought that my mother left a
<PB N="255" REF="256">
&s;um of money behind her. He knew not
of the illne&s;s that my children and I were
vi&s;ited with; and indeed it appears to me,
from what he hinted to your&s;elf, that he was
quite unacquainted with my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, my Cecilia, as you
know I am of a placable di&s;po&s;ition, I &s;hould
be glad to be on good terms with my bro|ther,
the only relation (my kin&s;man ex|cepted)
that I have in the world. I was
willing therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, a little to re|concile
Mr Warner to him; as I dur&s;t not,
without his permi&s;&s;ion, &s;eek a reconciliation
with Sir George.</P>
<P>There <HI>may</HI> be &s;omething in what you &s;ay,
Coz, an&s;wered my friend; perhaps he had a
mind to let you bite on the bridle for a while,
and I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e with you, that
hereafter, may be, he would have given you
&s;ome dirty trifle; for a generous thing I am
&s;ure he is not capable of, from his &s;ordidne&s;s
to me. I found this &s;tuck mo&s;t with the
good man. Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, but con&s;ider
Lady Sarah's influence &s;tepped in <HI>there</HI>
too. My brother, you acknowledge, <HI>was</HI>
going to give you &s;omething, 'till &s;he inter|po&s;ed.
&mdash;Half a crown, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid he:
To &s;ay the truth, I believe &s;he is the wor&s;t of
the two. She has a great deal of pride, Sir,
an&s;wered I; &s;he has communicated &s;ome of
it to my brother; probably he was mortified
and di&s;concerted at the &s;ight of &s;o near a re|lation,
<PB N="256" REF="257">
in his wife's pre&s;ence, who&s;e exterior
appearance could do him no credit; perhaps,
had you applied privately to him, he would
have behaved better. You have not much
worldly wi&s;dom, replied my cou&s;in, to ex|cu&s;e
him thus; however, I think the better
of you for it, whatever I may do of him.
But &s;peak hone&s;tly, now, don't you want to
be friends with Sir George, that he and his
wife may have an opportunity of &s;eeing you
in all your finery? As I knew Mr. Warner's
temper, I was re&s;olved to humour him in it,
and thought I could not give my de&s;ire of
&s;eeing my brother a better turn than this, to
one of my kin&s;man's di&s;po&s;ition. To deal
openly with you, Sir, &s;aid I, I think our
triumph over Lady Sarah will not be com|plete,
unle&s;s &s;he her&s;elf is a witne&s;s of that
high fortune, of which &s;he might have been
a partaker, had it not been for her own
meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. And to be &s;incere with
you, my Cecilia, I did think Lady Sarah de|&s;erved
this mortification, though it did not
&s;o far influence me as to make me de&s;irous
of being on terms with her: as for my bro|ther,
I was governed by no other motive than
affection towards him.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mr. Warner, &s;uppo&s;e yon were
to invite them both to dine with you, and to
have me at table, hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed out,
(for I can dre&s;s fine when I plea&s;e) and let
them &s;ee that the man, who was not thought
<PB N="257" REF="258">
worthy to &s;it down in their pre&s;ence, they
had better have u&s;ed with more ceremony. Oh,
Sir, &s;aid I, that would be too &s;evere an in&s;ult;
be&s;ides, I doubt whether my brother would
come; you know he is angry with me, and
thinks he has rea&s;on If you will permit me
fir&s;t to call on my brother, when we are re|conciled,
I can afterwards a&s;k both him and
his lady to my hou&s;e; and though I am &s;ure
you have too much good nature and polite|ne&s;s
to &s;hock them all at once, by violating
the laws of ho&s;pitality in this hou&s;e, which
your bounty has made mine, yet will you
have &s;ufficient room for retaliation, by treat|ing
them, in your turn, with neglect.</P>
<P>Thou art a milky thing, an&s;wered Mr.
Warner; but as I am willing to plea&s;e you,
you may do as you like; but by&mdash;, and he
&s;wore a tremendous oath, they &s;hall never
have a cro&s;s from me.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 27.&mdash;Having obtained Mr. War|ner's
con&s;ent, I went this day to my brother.
He was not at home, but I was introduced
to Lady Sarah, for whom. I enquired. Poor
woman! how &s;he looked! My re&s;entment
was di&s;armed; even my contempt &s;ub&s;ided;
and I felt nothing but pity. Her confu&s;ion
was &s;o great, &s;he knew hot how to receive
me: &s;he curte&s;ied without knowing what to
&s;ay, or how to behave. I would not embar|ra&s;s
her too far, but taking a chair by her,
As you favoured me with a me&s;&s;age ye&s;ter|day,
<PB N="258" REF="259">
Lady Sarah, &s;aid I, in as obliging a
tone as I could &s;peak, I thought it a &s;i&s;terly
duty to wait on you and Sir George: I hope
my brother is well, I long to &s;ee him, and
flatter my&s;elf he will forget all former cold|ne&s;s,
and again be my brother.</P>
<P>I &s;poke this long &s;entence on purpo&s;e to
give her time to recover her&s;elf. She rubbed
her hand over her forehead, I believe to hide
the glow that was in her face from my fir&s;t en|trance;
&startq;Lord, Mrs. Arnold&mdash;I am &s;o &s;ur|prized&mdash;this
vi&s;it was &s;o unexpected&mdash;I
thought you were in the country&endq;&mdash;(her
woman you know had been with me the day
before, I pa&s;&s;ed this by however) I have not
been out of town at all, Madam, I was de|tained
by illne&s;s&mdash;&startq;I am mighty &s;orry for
it&mdash;I hope you are quite recovered&mdash;pray,
why did not you let me know you were ill?&endq;
as I had heard nothing from you, Madam,
after my fir&s;t me&s;&s;age, I was afraid that the
mediation, you were &s;o kind as to promi&s;e
me, had failed, and that my brother's re|&s;entment
was &s;o great, he would not hear of
me.</P>
<P>&startq;Oh dear, that is true indeed&mdash;it was a
&s;ad affair&mdash;I mentioned you to your brother
when he came to town; but he was in <HI>&s;uch</HI>
a pa&s;&s;ion, I dur&s;t not name you to him a|gain.&endq;
(She dur&s;t not name me, ob&s;erve
that, my dear; poor George, whom &s;he go|verns
with de&s;potic &s;way) Then probably,
<PB N="259" REF="260">
Madam, my brother knew not <HI>all</HI> my di|&s;tre&s;s?
I prote&s;t I don't know&mdash;&s;aid &s;he&mdash;
you know your brother is very warm, and
when ever I attempted to &s;peak of you, he
always &s;topped me &s;hort&mdash;&s;o&mdash;I don't
know how it was; but I never could get to
tell him your &s;ituation&mdash;I &s;hould think I had
great rea&s;on to re&s;ent my brother's cruelty,
Madam, &s;aid I, if he had known tho&s;e par|ticulars
of which my maid informed <HI>you,</HI> but
&s;ince he did not, I will not reproach him;
neither will I accu&s;e your lady&s;hip of unkind|ne&s;s
in concealing them from him. My &s;uf|ferings
are, thank God! at an end, and I
am now come to offer you, and Sir George,
my &s;i&s;terly love, I hope he will not refu&s;e me
his love in return, I have nothing el&s;e now to
a&s;k for. She blu&s;hed again, and &s;eemed in
great confu&s;ion; &startq;You are very good, Mrs.
Arnold, we mu&s;t forget and forgive&endq;&mdash;
Shall I not be permitted to &s;ee my brother,
Madam? By the me&s;&s;age I received from
you, I was in hopes you had prevailed on
him&mdash;The poor woman was now &s;truck
dumb. She felt for her &s;nuff-box, and <HI>would</HI>
not find it in her pocket; but got up to look
for it to gain a little time; rummaged her toi|let,
and at la&s;t took it out of her pocket;
offered me a pinch of &s;nuff, then &s;at down
again. Why, that me&s;&s;age, to tell you the
truth, &s;aid &s;he (forcing a con&s;cious &s;illy &s;mile)
your brother knew nothing of; but not having
<PB N="260" REF="261">
heard from you in &s;o long a time, I was re|&s;olved
to enquire after you; and was de|termined,
my&s;elf, out of my own pin-mo|ney,
to allow you what I could &s;pare, till I
could get Sir George in better temper; but I
made u&s;e of his name, becau&s;e I thought you
would more readily accept of any thing from
him than from me. Your brother thought
you were actually in the country, till we
were &s;urprized with the account of the <HI>won|derful</HI>
fortune that has come to you lately.
&startq;Then you <HI>had</HI> heard of it, Madam, inter|rupted
I, before you &s;ent to me?&endq; an un|toward
que&s;tion, my dear; it plunged her
again in the mud, and &s;he flounced and
floundered to get out, which only &s;unk
her the deeper. We had heard a &s;trange
flying report, &s;aid &s;he, of which I did not
believe a word, and therefore &s;ent Holmes
(that is her woman's name) to you to offer
you my &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I was not ill-natured enough, my Cecilia,
to per&s;i&s;t in embarra&s;&s;ing this mean woman
any farther, though the in&s;incerity of her
whole behaviour, and the low fal&s;ities &s;he
had recour&s;e to, very well de&s;erved reproof.
I was glad to find my brother was not &s;o
culpable as he had at fir&s;t appeared; for I
could ea&s;ily di&s;cover from the whole tenor of
her di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he was &s;o far from giving him
any intimation of my di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he had
prevented him from enquiring after me, by
<PB N="261" REF="262">
telling him that I was gone out of town;
probably too with &s;ome aggravating circum|&s;tances,
either of a pretended neglect on my
&s;ide towards them both, or, perhaps, &s;ome
other fal&s;hood &s;till more injurious. It was very
apparent that &s;he had &s;ent her maid only as
a &s;py, and, by way of pa&s;&s;port, with a &s;ham
offer of kindne&s;s, of which &s;he knew I &s;tood
not in need: and &s;he depended on my pride
and re&s;entment &s;o ju&s;tly provoked, for my
never coming to any explanation either with
her or my brother. No wonder then, &s;he
was confounded at the &s;ight of me, and the
more &s;o, as &s;he apprehended I might re|proach
my brother, who could &s;o well excu&s;e
him&s;elf by pleading ignorance of my &s;itua|tion:
and her conduct mu&s;t then appear &s;o
de&s;picable to her hu&s;band, that hardy as &s;he
is, &s;he would be at a lo&s;s to ju&s;tify it.</P>
<P>All this being very obvious to me, I de|termined
to make her ea&s;y at once. I &s;hall
think no more of what is pa&s;t, Lady Sarah,
&s;aid I, I only wi&s;h to be on terms of friend|&s;hip
with my brother and you; and &s;ince he
knows not of the me&s;&s;age you &s;ent to me, I
will not mention it to him, nor any thing
el&s;e that can recal pa&s;t unkindne&s;s. I hope
this vi&s;it will be taken as it is meant, out of
pure affection, and that you, Madam, will
be &s;o kind as to make my peace with my
brother; whom I am very &s;orry I was under
a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;obliging, but as I never did
<PB N="262" REF="263">
offend him, and I am &s;ure never &s;hould but
in that one in&s;tance, wherein <HI>I</HI> was &s;o much
more nearly intere&s;ted than him&s;elf, I hope
he will think no more of it; but re&s;tore me
to a &s;hare of his love, which is all that is
now wanting to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This declaration (as I intended it &s;hould)
entirely re&s;tored Lady Sarah's tranquillity.
Her countenance brightened up; I'll take
upon me to an&s;wer for Sir George, &s;aid &s;he,
that he <HI>&s;hall</HI> re&s;tore you to his affection; I
&s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon a general act of oblivion be|ing
pa&s;t on his &s;ide, and I beg, &s;i&s;ter, on
your part, that you may not, by reproaching
your brother, revive the memory of your
pa&s;t coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>The weake&s;t people are often very cun|ning;
this caution of Lady Sarah's, artfully
enough introduced, conveyed an obvious
meaning to me, very different from her pre|tended
rea&s;on; &s;he was afraid of an eclair|ce&s;&s;ement.
I promi&s;ed her I &s;hould meet my
brother, whenever he would permit me, as if
nothing had ever happened to di&s;turb our
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>See, my dear, how this woman, who <HI>dur&s;t</HI>
not name me when I was poor, took upon
her now to <HI>make</HI> her hu&s;band, who&s;e anger
had &s;o much intimidated her, &s;ub&s;cribe in|tirely
to her opinion: but I was now become
an object of attention; a finer hou&s;e, and
a finer equipage than her lady&s;hip's, gave
<PB N="263" REF="264">
me an indi&s;putable title to that regard, to
which, as a <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> and in di&s;tre&s;s, I had not the
lea&s;t claim.</P>
<P>She now ventured to a&s;k me &s;ome parti|culars
relating to the very extraordinary
change in my fortune. I &s;atisfied her mi|nutely,
not without mentioning the cau&s;e of
Mr. Warner's having made me the <HI>&s;ole</HI> ob|ject
of his bounty. Poor Lady Sarah could
not conceal her vexation at the thoughts of
what &s;he had lo&s;t by her ill-timed pride and
parcimony. A &s;trange whim&s;ical old mortal,
&s;he called him, to come upon them &s;o ab|ruptly,
and in &s;uch a &s;candalous garb, that
Sir George was quite a&s;hamed of him. I am
glad, however, Mrs. Arnold, that he has
made <HI>you</HI> the better for him; I hope he will
continue his fondne&s;s, but &s;uch odd hu|mouri&s;ts
are not to be depended on. Don't
tell him, however, what I &s;ay; I &s;hould be
glad to &s;hew him any civility in my power,
for his kindne&s;s to you.</P>
<P>I took my leave of her lady&s;hip, with a
cordial invitation to come and &s;ee me; which
&s;he &s;aid &s;he would not fail to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner called on me for a few mi|nutes
in the evening to know the re&s;ult of
my vi&s;it, as I had told him I intended to
make it. I related every thing that had
pa&s;&s;ed between Lady Sarah and me; he en|joyed
her confu&s;ion as I de&s;cribed it, with a
triumphant &s;atisfaction, which nothing but a
<PB N="264" REF="265">
very &s;trong re&s;entment could have excited
in &s;o good-natured a man, as he really &s;eems
to be.</P>
<P>He has added to my &s;tore of china to|day
(of which I have already an abundance)
a pair of mo&s;t magnificent jars, above four
feet high, which, he values at a hundred
and fifty pounds; the&s;e, with an entire &s;er|vice
of the fine&s;t Nankeen china, and a
mo&s;t beautiful Per&s;ian carpet, I have &s;et apart
as a pre&s;ent for Lady V&mdash;, and &s;hall &s;end
them to her the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner very much approves of my
de&s;ign, as he knows the obligations I have to
her.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o got him to be&s;peak a &s;et of
jewels to the amount of fifteen hundred
pounds, with which I intend to pre&s;ent Mrs.
Faulkland. This &s;um will not exceed my
debt to Mr. Faulkland, if his agreement
with Pivet &s;tands in force for the term
pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, who mightily loves to be
employed, has undertaken to get the&s;e
jewels made up for me in the mo&s;t elegant
ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This man's genero&s;ity is as inexhau&s;tible
as his riches; I fancy he is &s;till &s;ome way
concerned in trade, though he does not tell
me &s;o. The&s;e jars he &s;aid he had ju&s;t re|ceived
by the arrival of an Ea&s;t-India &s;hip,
and I under&s;tand that his former dealings
<PB N="265" REF="266">
were extremely exten&s;ive: all over the world,
he &s;aid, where there was commerce, he put
in for his &s;hare.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 29.&mdash;Lady Sarah has returned
my vi&s;it; &s;he was not &s;low you &s;ee in her
ceremony. <HI>So</HI> obliging, <HI>&s;o</HI> polite; every
thing prai&s;ed, and admired; and <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> at
every &s;econd word, and the children care&s;&s;ed,
<HI>Arnold</HI>'s children. What a fine thing it is,
my dear, to be independent! I &s;hewed her
all my hou&s;e; but not with o&s;tentation. I
thought it would have looked affected not to
have recommended &s;o much wealth and ele|gance
to her notice. My &s;ideboard, &s;he &s;ays,
is ab&s;olutely the hand&s;ome&s;t &s;he ever &s;aw;
indeed both for workman&s;hip and richne&s;s it
does &s;urpa&s;s any I have &s;een.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had talked to my brother,
and that though he &s;till re&s;ented my ob&s;ti|nacy,
as <HI>he</HI> called it, yet as I had made &s;uch
advances towards a reconciliation, he was
very ready to meet me, and de&s;ired every
thing might be forgotten on my &s;ide, as it
&s;hould be on his. He would have come to
&s;ee you, added Lady Sarah, but as he does
not chu&s;e to meet Mr. Warner, he would
rather that the fir&s;t interview between you
were at his own hou&s;e. I told her lady&s;hip
I would breakfa&s;t with her the next morning,
and we parted upon wonderful courteous
terms.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">
<HI>January</HI> 30.&mdash;Ju&s;t returned from my bro|ther's.
Sir George received me with open
arms, and I returned the embrace with the
utmo&s;t cordiality of affection. Surely, my
dear, there is &s;omething wonderfully powerful
in the natural affections; Sir George, &s;pite of
his re&s;entment, his turbulence, and the threats
denounced again&s;t me, could not at &s;ight of
me, after an ab&s;ence of &s;o many months,
re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t impul&s;e of his heart, in giving
me &s;trong tokens of brotherly love; though
probably had he not &s;een me, the latent ten|derne&s;s
might have lain for ever dormant in
his heart.</P>
<P>I entered immediately on the topic of my
extraordinary acqui&s;ition, as I was determined
not to lead to a &s;ubject which might bring on
the explanations &s;o much dreaded by Lady
Sarah; and I could ob&s;erve that my brother
avoided any thing tending that way as much
as I did.</P>
<P>He congratulated me heartily on my good
fortune, but &s;aid, between je&s;t and earne&s;t,
that if he could have divined his cou&s;in War|ner
had come to him to make experiments,
he &s;hould have taken care to have treated
him better. But I don't know how it was,
&s;aid he, he came in an evil hour; and I was
in an ill humour.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah kept up the conver&s;ation with
a great deal of vivacity; always taking care
to keep clear of the rock &s;he was afraid of,
<PB N="267" REF="268">
till a lady, with whom &s;he was engaged to
go to an auction, called to take her up. Sir
George would fain have detained me, but &s;he
in&s;i&s;ted on my going with her, to have <HI>my</HI>
judgment &s;he &s;aid on the things &s;he intended
to buy. It appeared to me that &s;he did not
chu&s;e to leave my brother and me together,
for fear mutual confidence (in the fulne&s;s of
our hearts) might have brought her di&s;inge|nuous
proceedings to light: but cunning
people often over-act their parts; &s;he was &s;o
extremely pre&s;&s;ing that my brother could not
but take notice of it. I acquie&s;ced to avoid
giving her unea&s;ine&s;s; having fir&s;t engaged
my brother to dine with me on Friday. Lady
Sarah and he both con&s;ented, but promi&s;ed,
that Mr. Warner was not to be of the party;
this I ventured to promi&s;e, as I was re&s;olved,
if Mr. Warner invited him&s;elf, which is his
u&s;ual way, to put him off by fairly telling
him the truth, and tru&s;ting to his good na|ture
for the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 2&mdash;After the trivial incidents of
the&s;e two la&s;t days, my Cecilia, now ha&s;ten
to more intere&s;ting particulars. But fir&s;t a
word or two of my cou&s;in Warner. I had
not &s;een him &s;ince the day that my brother
and I met, till this morning; when he called
to a&s;k me how I did, and to know how the
puppy George, as he calls him, had behaved
to me. After having &s;atisfied him in this
enquiry, in a way the mo&s;t favourable I could
<PB N="268" REF="269">
for my brother, I told him, that as I had
really found both him, and his lady extreme|ly
penitent and mortified, I had a&s;ked them
to dine with me that day. I am glad of it,
&s;aid he, (very quick) I'll be here to &s;noutch
them. Dear Sir, &s;aid I, for heaven's &s;ake
have a little compa&s;&s;ion: you cannot conceive
how humbled they are; they dare not look
you in the face, and it was one of their con|ditions
with me, before they would con&s;ent to
come, that they &s;hould not &s;ee you. Ho, ho,
&s;aid he, exultingly, have they changed their
Note? Well, I will not di&s;tre&s;s you &s;o far in
your own hou&s;e, as to mortify them with my
company at dinner, but if I &s;hould take it in
my head to drop in, in the afternoon, you
mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s. I only want to &s;ee
them look a little like fools.</P>
<P>I could not venture to oppo&s;e him in this,
but re&s;olved to make it as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible,
by preparing my brother and &s;i&s;ter for his
vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I told him that would do extremely well,
and he went away rejoicing at the thoughts of
his intended triumph.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner had but ju&s;t left me, when I
was &s;urprized with a me&s;&s;age that Sir George
was below. I went down to him directly,
and &s;eeing him in his morning-dre&s;s, ima|gined
that &s;omething had happened which
prevented their dining with me, and that he
called to excu&s;e him&s;elf; but he undeceived
<PB N="269" REF="270">
me pre&s;ently. As I had not an opportunity,
&s;aid he, of a&s;king you any que&s;tions the other
day, and &s;hall be prevented probably in the
&s;ame manner this day, I am come to have
an hour's chat with you before dinner. And
fir&s;t, pray inform me, Sidney, where you
have lived ever &s;ince my mother's death, and
how it comes to pa&s;s, that in all this time,
you never took any notice of either Lady
Sarah or me? As to your fir&s;t que&s;tion, bro|ther,
it is ea&s;ily an&s;wered, I have never been
out of London: for the re&s;t, let us avoid all
retro&s;pection, which can now an&s;wer no end
to either of us.</P>
<P>You &s;urprize me, &s;aid he, I under&s;tood
you had been in the country; Lady Sarah
was told that you were gone to Lady V&mdash;.</P>
<P>She was mi&s;informed, I replied&mdash;</P>
<P>What was the meaning then, &s;aid he, that
you never called, or &s;ent to her? <HI>She</HI> had no
re&s;entment to you, though <HI>I</HI> had.</P>
<P>Dear Sir George, a&s;k me no more que&s;tions,
I thought it had been premi&s;ed that we were
not to talk of the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, Sidney, an&s;wered he, there is &s;ome|thing
you have no mind to explain; you
know I love and re&s;pect my wife, and that I
cannot ea&s;ily be brought to take any thing ill
of her; but &s;he was &s;o extremely earne&s;t with
me not to a&s;k you any que&s;tions, that it made
me &s;u&s;pect there was &s;omething &s;he had a
mind to conceal from me. What confirms
<PB N="270" REF="271">
me in this opinion, is, that as I know you
are ingenuous and open to conviction, you
would have made me &s;ome apology for a ne|glect
both of me and Lady Sarah, which,
you could not but &s;uppo&s;e, offended me, if
you had not looked upon your&s;elf as by much
the mo&s;t injured Per&s;on.</P>
<P>You urge me very home, brother; I
thought I was injured when you di&s;claimed
all relation&s;hip to me, if I did not comply in
a certain particular, which I was not at liberty
to do.</P>
<P>I <HI>was</HI> very angry with you, &s;aid he, but
&s;hould not have carried my re&s;entment any
lengths after my mother's death, if you had
made any conce&s;&s;ion, or de&s;ired to throw
your&s;elf under my protection, in&s;tead of a
&s;tranger's, for Lady V&mdash;comparatively is
one. I could not &s;uppo&s;e you were in imme|diate
want of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as I under&s;tand
my mother's private pur&s;e was not incon&s;i|derable,
and to tell you the truth, I was re|&s;olved
till you did conde&s;cend to inform me
of your &s;ituation, not to give my&s;elf any pain
about you.</P>
<P>I can only tell you in two words, Sir
George, that you have been extremely mi&s;|led
in regard to me; I wi&s;h not to revive &s;o
di&s;agreeable a &s;ubject, pray &s;ay no more of
it.</P>
<P>But one word more, &s;aid he, ju&s;t for my
own &s;atisfaction, and then I have done: was
<PB N="271" REF="272">
Lady Sarah made acquainted with your cir|cum&s;tances?
You mu&s;t have lived in mi&s;erable
ob&s;curity to be &s;o long in London without my
knowledge.</P>
<P>You love and re&s;pect your wife, brother;
you mu&s;t not take any thing ill of her.</P>
<P>I am an&s;wered, he replied: He walked
about the room, and I could &s;ee he was a|&s;hamed
and affected.</P>
<P>You will make me very unhappy, Sir
George, &s;aid I, if you re&s;ent any thing on
my account to your lady; &s;he did not think,
perhaps, that things were quite &s;o bad with
me as they really were; but if &s;he heard
(which by the way I knew was an invention
of her own) that my mother left any thing
behind her, &s;he was deceived, there really
was nothing. But let us call another &s;ub|ject.&mdash;When
did you hear from Mr. Faulk|land?
it is &s;ome time &s;ince I have had a let|ter
from his lady.</P>
<P>His lady, he repeated, and &s;tamping with
his foot, cur&s;ed be the hour which gave her
that title!</P>
<P>Dear Sir George, you &s;hock me! how can
you be &s;o uncharitable, &s;o unchri&s;tian?</P>
<P>If you knew her as well as <HI>I</HI> do, &s;aid he,&mdash;and
&s;hook his head.</P>
<P>You are &s;o &s;trong in your indignation a|gain&s;t
her, I replied, that you almo&s;t make
me &s;u&s;pect that you <HI>do</HI> know more of her than
I do; her weakne&s;s in regard to Mr. Faulk|land
<PB N="272" REF="273">
excepted; I could never entertain an
ill thought of her; but you have rai&s;ed
a curio&s;ity, which, though I tremble to
have it gratified, yet I mu&s;t beg you to &s;peak
out.</P>
<P>Do not think me malicious, Sidney, &s;aid
he, a woman's reputation is too &s;acred a
thing to be trifled with; if her weakne&s;s, as
you call it, had been confined to Mr. Faulk|land,
<HI>her's</HI> &s;hould be &s;o with me: but I can|not
think, with temper, on the &s;acrifice that
noble fellow has been forced to make to
caprice.</P>
<P>Dear brother, explain your&s;elf; you terri|fy
me.</P>
<P>My heat on this occa&s;ion, he an&s;wered,
would be unju&s;tifiable, if I had not <HI>proof</HI>
for what I &s;ay; Mi&s;s Burchell, for I will not
call her by my friend's name, is that mon|&s;ter,
a female libertine, a rake in the wor&s;t
&s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>Mon&s;trous! cried I, your prejudice makes
you believe every cruel tale you may have
heard.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Heard!</HI> he interrupted with an indignant
&s;mile, the d&mdash;l's in it, if I have not more
than <HI>hear-&s;ay</HI> for my knowledge.</P>
<P>Lord! brother, you make me &s;hudder;
what do you mean?</P>
<P>He replied, you will not believe me per|haps,
when I tell you, that <HI>I</HI> am as much
<PB N="273" REF="274">
obliged to Mi&s;s Burchell's favour, as Mr.
Faulkland was.</P>
<P>If Sir George had plunged a dagger in
my heart, I could not have felt a &s;harper
pang. He &s;aw me &s;truck with amazement
and grief.</P>
<P>I knew it would &s;hock you, &s;aid he, but
you extorted the &s;ecret from me; for a &s;e|cret
it has, and ever &s;hould have, remained,
but in my own ju&s;tification you compelled
me to di&s;clo&s;e it.</P>
<P>You know, &s;aid he, that from the fir&s;t I
never con&s;idered Faulkland's engagement
to her, as a &s;erious one, nor in any &s;hape
binding: This judgment I formed, without
knowing any thing of the woman, but from
Faulkland's own repre&s;entation of the fact;
tho', to &s;ay the truth, he always &s;poke of her
with more tenderne&s;s than &s;he de&s;erved;
and imputing her frailty to her love of him,
was, as mo&s;t men are apt to do on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions,
di&s;po&s;ed to judge favourably of her.
The fir&s;t time I &s;aw her was at Sidney Ca&s;|tle&punc;
that time when my mother invited her,
and when, you may remember, I went
down there in compliment to my mother.
I own I thought her extremely agreeable,
which was alone &s;ufficient to make me a
little more than barely polite; but my mo|ther's
extraordinary attachment to her en|gaged
me to go &s;till further, and to oblige
her, I was more than ordinarily attentive
<PB N="274" REF="275">
to plea&s;e Mi&s;s Burchell. When I a&s;&s;ure
you, upon my honour, that I had no farther
views, I believe you will not doubt my ve|racity;
but whether Mi&s;s Burchell mi&s;took
my civilities for fondne&s;s, or whether, as
I rather believe, her natural di&s;po&s;ition was
&s;o loo&s;e, that every man &s;he &s;aw lighted up a
flame in her heart, I know not; but certain it
was, &s;he made me &s;uch advances, that I mu&s;t
have been extremely &s;tupid not to have un|der&s;tood
her, and ab&s;olutely frozen, to have
repelled her.</P>
<P>My good mother's un&s;u&s;pecting temper
permitted us too many opportunities, and
the light ones of your &s;ex do not ea&s;ily for|give
the neglect of tho&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mi&s;s Burchell yielded to the im|petuo&s;ity
of her wi&s;hes, and I followed her
lead, more through vacancy, and a want of
better employment, than out of inclination.
I was very glad when &s;he was recalled home,
for I was heartily weary of her. The day
before &s;he left Sidney Ca&s;tle, when we were
alone, &s;he &s;aid to me, I have too great a re|liance
on your honour, to &s;uppo&s;e you capa|ble
of injuring my reputation, by ever di|vulging
what has pa&s;&s;ed between us; I am
ea&s;y therefore on that head. But there is
one circum&s;tance, on which you mu&s;t give
me the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e that is in your
power to make, without which I &s;hall be
the mo&s;t unhappy creature in the world.
<PB N="275" REF="276">
I know there is a friend&s;hip between you
and Mr. Faulkland, and I am not ignorant
that you men, in your unre&s;erved moments
of confidence, do not &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e &s;uch
&s;ecrets as I have entru&s;ted you with; I do not
fear your imprudence with regard to any
one el&s;e; but it is of the utmo&s;t importance
to me, that <HI>He</HI> in particular &s;hould never
know what my tenderne&s;s for you has led
me into. You know I have a &s;on by him;
he has hitherto provided liberally for the
child's maintenance; and, to let you into a
&s;ecret, which no-body be&s;ides mu&s;t know,
I my&s;elf am indebted to him for the princi|pal
part of my &s;upport; though he, as well
as the re&s;t of the world, believe that I have
a fortune. Now, though I do not entertain
the lea&s;t hope, nor indeed wi&s;h, ever to be
Mr. Faulkland's wife, yet would it be of
terrible con&s;equence to me, to forfeit his re|gard,
which you may naturally &s;uppo&s;e
would be the ca&s;e, if he were to come to
the knowledge of what has happened. He
has given me to under&s;tand by his hou&s;e|keeper,
that, when he comes to England, he
will provide for me: the woman hinted
&s;omething like a de&s;ign of his making a
hand&s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment for any worthy man
of whom I &s;hould make choice; in&s;inuating,
at the &s;ame time, that this depended on my
conduct. I have no thoughts of marrying;
but as mine and my child's future welfare
<PB N="276" REF="277">
mu&s;t be chiefly owing to Mr. Faulkland,
you &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity there is for my pre&s;erv|ing
his good opinion. For this rea&s;on, then,
my dear Sir George, you mu&s;t &s;wear to me,
that you will never betray me to him.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons were &s;o plau&s;ible, and the
reque&s;t &s;o natural, that I made no &s;cruple of
giving her a &s;olemn oath, to pre&s;erve the
&s;ecret inviolable from Faulkland's know|ledge;
for &s;o &s;he her&s;elf worded the promi&s;e
&s;he urged me to make: in regard to any one
el&s;e, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;atisfied all a&s;&s;urances
were needle&s;s.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, continued my brother, that by
this declaration, &s;he laid me under a double
tye of &s;ecrecy. As I had no conception
that Faulkland could ever be brought to
think of marrying her, I thought my&s;elf
bound not to injure her in his opinion: and
therefore religiou&s;ly kept my promi&s;e.
Faulkland was not then in England; but
when he returned, and came to vi&s;it me at
Sidney Ca&s;tle, ju&s;t at the time you parted
from your hu&s;band, he &s;poke of Mi&s;s Bur|ehell
in a manner, which, though it con|vinced
me he had a regard for her, and
wi&s;hed to &s;ee her happy, yet was it far from
alarming me on his own account; I there|fore
&s;hould have thought it the highe&s;t
ba&s;ene&s;s and cruelty to have hurt her in his
e&s;teem.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278">
I never have had the lea&s;t intercour&s;e, ei|ther
by letter, or otherwi&s;e, with Mi&s;s Bur|chell,
&s;ince we parted. I make no doubt
but &s;he has di&s;pen&s;ed her favours wherever
her inclination has led her, and you &s;ee &s;he
has had the good fortune to keep all her
amours &s;ecret. But what hope can there
be, that &s;uch a profligate will keep her faith
to <HI>one</HI> man, though that man is the mo&s;t
amiable in the World?</P>
<P>Oh, brother, what a &s;cene of iniquity
have you di&s;clo&s;ed! I would to Heaven you
had kept the horrid &s;ecret to your&s;elf, or
divulged it time enough to have prevented
the mi&s;ery, into which I, unhappy that I
am! have precipitated your friend. But I
ought not to blame you; you acted agree|ably
to the dictates of honour. Dete&s;table
woman! I cried, in the bitterne&s;s of my
heart, I do not wonder at her cautioning
me again&s;t letting you into my de&s;ign of
urging Mr. Faulkland to marry her; I then
little knew the rea&s;on you had for the oppo|&s;ition
&s;he &s;aid you would give to this fatal
match: every thing fell out to her wi&s;h,
and coincided to promote her &s;ucce&s;sful
guilt.&mdash;Your ab&s;ence from London, mine,
and my mother's urgency, and the too ge|nerous
yielding of our dear unhappy Faulk|land.
I bur&s;t into tears&mdash;my heart was torn
with angui&s;h, and in that in&s;tant my tender|ne&s;s
for him revived. Sir George &s;trove not
<PB N="278" REF="279">
to comfort me. He was too much affected
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have but one hope, &s;aid I, and that is,
in the extraordinary love &s;he has for Mr.
Faulkland, and his uncommon merit, which
may probably en&s;ure to him the continuance
of it.</P>
<P>You know not what you &s;ay, an&s;wered
my brother; the merit of an angel could
not &s;ecure the fidelity of &s;uch a heart as
her's. Her love is gro&s;s; a new object
will always have charms for her. Had I
been as credulous as Faulkland, I &s;hould
have thought my&s;elf the idol of her &s;oul, &s;o
lavi&s;h was &s;he in her expre&s;&s;ions of tender|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange though, I a&s;ked, that,
with &s;o loo&s;e a mind, &s;he &s;hould have &s;o long
pre&s;erved an attachment to Mr. Faulkland?
for mo&s;t certainly her affection to <HI>him</HI> has at
lea&s;t been &s;incere.</P>
<P>Her affection to his e&s;tate, an&s;wered my
brother, has, I believe, all along been &s;incere.
Do you not know &s;he is a beggar?</P>
<P>I told him, in this &s;he had impo&s;ed on
him, to an&s;wer her own ends, in engaging
him the more firmly to keep her &s;ecret; for,
to my knowledge, &s;he had &s;even thou&s;and
pounds, as 1 was informed by Lady V&mdash;,
who knew her circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Sir George vented two or three cur&s;es on
her head. I am not &s;urprized at any in|&s;tance
<PB N="279" REF="280">
of her fal&s;hood, &s;aid he; &s;he is made
up of deceit. Such characters as her's are
not uncommon; but none of them ever fell
in your way before, and I hope never will
again. If you will look back on her whole
conduct, however it may &s;urprize you, you
will find there is nothing incon&s;i&s;tent in it.
She is only a &s;ly rake in petticoats, of which
there are numbers, that you good women
would &s;tare at, if you knew their behaviour.
She con&s;iders men, ju&s;t as the libertines of
our &s;ex do women. She likes for the pre|&s;ent;
&s;he &s;educes; her inclinations cool to|wards
an old lover, and are warmed again
by a new face. She retained not Faulkland
long enough to grow tired of him, and
therefore po&s;&s;ibly &s;till pre&s;erved &s;ome ten|derne&s;s
for him; indeed his uncommon at|tractions
mu&s;t have made an impre&s;&s;ion
even on <HI>her</HI> heart; but this did not hinder
her from indulging her inclinations el&s;e|where.
You mu&s;t throw into the account
too, that &s;he had, by accident, got a &s;ort of
hold on him, of which, by my mother's in|dulgence,
and &s;ome other concurring cir|cum&s;tances,
&s;he hoped, one day or other, to
avail her&s;elf. With &s;o pretty a per&s;on as
&s;he has, and the fortune you tell me &s;he is
mi&s;tre&s;s of, do you think &s;he could have
failed of marrying creditably, if that had
been her view? No, no, &s;he meant not to
confine her&s;elf. Her pa&s;&s;ion for Faulkland,
<PB N="280" REF="281">
whether real or pretended, gave a colour
to her pre&s;erving that liberty, in the licen|tious
u&s;e of which &s;he placed her happine&s;s:
nor would &s;he, in the end, have confined
her&s;elf within the bounds of marriage, if
an immen&s;e fortune had not &s;weetened the
re&s;traint.</P>
<P>I pray Heaven it may, an&s;wered I; 'tis all
we have now to tru&s;t to. You have given
me an idea of a character, which I thought
was not in the female world.</P>
<P>I own, replied Sir George, I live in per|petual
fears of her relap&s;ing into vice. A
woman without principle, Sidney, is not to
be relied on. Love (if in &s;uch a brea&s;t it can
merit that name) even towards the mo&s;t
de&s;erving object, is never permanent. Fear,
and even &s;hame, are &s;ubdued by repeated
crimes; what hold then remains; intere&s;t
alone (where that happens to interfere); but
if detection can be avoided, even that can
have no farther influence.</P>
<P>Sir George took his leave of me, in or|der
to go home to dre&s;s; but I was not to
&s;ay a word of his morning vi&s;it, &s;o that I
found I needed not to be under any appre|hen&s;ions
of his reproaching Lady Sarah with
her behaviour towards me; for he meant
not to let her know he was informed of it.
So much the better; I &s;hould be extremely
&s;orry to be the occa&s;ion of any difference be|tween
them.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="282">
They came at the appointed hour; I en|tertained
them magnificently; and we were
all harmony and good humour. When
dinner was over, I told them, they mu&s;t not
be &s;urpri&s;ed, if we &s;hould have a vi&s;it from
our We&s;t-Indian relation, in the evening;
for, that it was very probable he would call,
and if I &s;hould be denied, he would never
forgive me, as he might po&s;&s;ibly find it out.
Lady Sarah looked frightened, and &s;aid &s;he
would not &s;tay; but Sir George declared he
would arm him&s;elf with a few bumpers, and
&s;tand his ground.</P>
<P>I affected to treat the interview with plea|&s;antry,
and reconciled them both to it; for
I was really apprehen&s;ive, that Mr. Warner
would take it very ill, and think I betrayed
him, if I let them e&s;cape. I &s;uppo&s;ed too,
that after he had indulged him&s;elf in a &s;hort
triumph, all would be over, and they might
afterwards meet on better terms.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an hour, we heard a loud
rap; Lady Sarah turned pale; Sir George
laughed at her, but was him&s;elf a little di&s;|concerted.
The parlour door flew open&mdash;
a footman entered&mdash;Mr. Warner&mdash;and in
&s;talked my kin&s;man, with a very &s;tately
tread. He was dre&s;&s;ed out, I a&s;&s;ure you. A
large well-powdered wig, tied with, a ro&s;e;
a &s;uit of the fine&s;t cinnamon-coloured cloth,
and over it a &s;urtout of the riche&s;t mohair
and &s;ilk, with gold frogs; and a fine cloud|ed
<PB N="282" REF="283">
cane, with a gold head; &s;ilk &s;tockings
of the &s;ame colour with his coat; a fine lace|cravat,
his hat under his arm. He really
looked very gentleman-like, and venerable;
for he appears older than he is.</P>
<P>He glanced his eyes, with a &s;upercilious
&s;corn, over my brother and &s;i&s;ter, who &s;tood
up at his entrance, and making up directly
to me, &s;aluted me, and took his place by
me. A &s;hort &s;ilence en&s;ued, which was
broken by my a&s;king Mr. Warner to drink a
gla&s;s of wine. I could almo&s;t have &s;miled
at the embarra&s;&s;me$$ of my brother and
Lady Sarah; the old gentleman enjoyed it,
and looked at them both, but as if he knew
neither. My brother had recour&s;e to the
bottle; he drank my health, and civilly
enough bowed to Mr. Warner, ju&s;t pro|nouncing
the word Sir!&mdash;the other &s;carce
returned it by a &s;light inclination of his
head.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, cou&s;in,
if you have no aver&s;ion to tobacco, I &s;hould
be glad you would indulge me with a pipe;
'tis my cu&s;tom after dinner, but I have not
&s;moaked yet.</P>
<P>As I had never ob&s;erved him to do this,
when he had dined with me before, I took
it for granted, the compliment was meant
for Lady Sarah.</P>
<P>I &s;aid <HI>I</HI> had no objection, and referred
my&s;elf by a bow to Lady Sarah.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="284">
She made no reply, and my kin&s;man,
without &s;eeming to mind any one el&s;e, rang
the bell, &s;aying, If <HI>you</HI> don't di&s;like it, there
is no more to be &s;aid. The black, whom
he had given me, pre&s;enting him&s;elf at the
door, Mr. Warner de&s;ired him to &s;tep to his
lodgings for his pipe, and &s;ome tobacco.
The man quickly returned with a long
japaned reed, with a boll fixed at the end of
it. Mr. Warner called for a lighted taper,
and throwing him&s;elf back in his chair with
one leg cro&s;&s;ed over the other; lighted his
pipe with much compo&s;ure, puffing large
clouds of &s;moak a-cro&s;s Lady Sarah's no&s;e,
who &s;at at his right-hand My &s;i&s;ter, who
had really an unaffected aver&s;ion to tobacco,
could not bear this; &s;he coughed exce&s;|&s;ively,
and, with tears in her eyes, ro&s;e off
her chair, and retired to the other end of
the room. My old gentleman laughed till
he wheezed, nodded his head after her,
and looking at me, as much as to &s;ay, I am
glad I have &s;ent her off.</P>
<P>Sir George, though determined not to be
put out of humour, thought this was go|ing
too far; I was really unea&s;y my&s;elf, and
hardly knew how to act; for if I &s;hewed
any mark of di&s;tinction to Lady Sarah, I
knew it would be con&s;trued by Mr. Warner
as an affront to him. I ventured, however,
to tell her, that if &s;he would &s;tep into the
<PB N="284" REF="285">
drawing-room, I &s;hould order coffee, and
wait on her immediately.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid my brother, approaching his
Lady, and taking her by the hand, let us get
out of the horrid atmo&s;phere that this hone&s;t
gentleman has rai&s;ed about us. The hone&s;t
gentleman vouch&s;afed not to look at him,
and my brother and &s;i&s;ter withdrew into the
adjoining room.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr. Warner
threw down his pipe, and, &s;triking the table
with his clenched fi&s;t, bur&s;t into a loud
laugh. Lord, Lord! &s;aid he, pride <HI>will</HI>
have a fall. I think I have brought them
down a little; how like a&s;&s;es they both
looked! Well, now I am &s;atisfied&mdash;I have
had my revenge, you may go and drink
your coffee with them; I'll bid you good|by.</P>
<P>He immediately withdrew, and I joined
my brother and &s;i&s;ter, who were heartily re|joiced

<P>Sir George &s;aid, he &s;aw his de&s;ign, but
was re&s;olved not to give an opportunity for
in&s;ults, and &s;o held his tongue. As he is
your friend, Sidney, &s;aid he, I would not
di&s;tre&s;s you, by engaging you as a party on
either &s;ide, which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e;
for that old fellow would not have &s;uffered
you to remain neutral.</P>

I told him our kin&s;man was whim&s;ical,
but that, as he was now thoroughly &s;atisfied,
at having paid them in kind, I was &s;ure he
would never again &s;eek to give them any
offence, and they ought to forgive him by
the law of retaliation.</P>
<P>They laughed at the &s;ingularity of his
manner, and the whole pa&s;&s;ed off in mirth:
though Lady Sarah declared, he had made
her quite &s;ick with his nau&s;eous tobacco.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 3.&mdash;The ridiculous &s;cene of ye&s;|terday,
my Cecilia, for a while called off
my thoughts from the melancholy &s;ubject,
which is now neare&s;t my heart, I mean the
&s;hocking account which Sir George gave
me of Mrs.&mdash;, can I bear to call her
&mdash;Faulkland! but it now recurs to me with
all its horrours. Oh, my dear, what a fatal
wretch have I been to Mr. Faulkland! my
be&s;t purpo&s;es, by &s;ome un&s;een power, are
perverted from their ends. I wonder the
food which I take to nouri&s;h me is not con|verted
into poi&s;on when I touch it. But I
will calm my troubled mind with this reflec|tion,
that I <HI>meant</HI> not to do evil. Mr. Faulk|land,
ignorant of his own misfortune, may
(as hundreds of others in the &s;ame &s;ituation
are) &s;till be happy, if that light creature has
but a &s;ingle grain of honour or gratitude.
I will net think of it&mdash;anticipating, as you
u&s;ed to call it, I will bani&s;h the hateful
idea from my mind.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287">
<HI>February</HI> 12.&mdash;What do you think, my
Cecilia? Mrs. Gerrarde has eloped from
her hu&s;band, and is now at Paris in quality
of mi&s;tre&s;s to a young nobleman, who main|tains
her in va&s;t &s;plendour. I had this
news in a letter from Mrs. Faulkland to|day.</P>
<P>Poor Pivet wrote his ma&s;ter an account
of it. You know the agreement, to pay
this young man an annual &s;um, was con|ditional.
Upon Mr. Arnold's death, Pivet,
tired of the termagant &s;pirit, and intolera|ble
coquetry of his wife, was very glad to
relax his di&s;cipline; and declared, were he
to have had a thou&s;and a year, he would
not undertake to keep her within bounds;
and that nothing but his great re&s;pect for
Mr. Faulkland could have engaged him in
the ta&s;k &s;o long. He acknowledges, that he
is very glad to be rid of her; and as Mr.
Faulkland enabled him to &s;et up very hand|&s;omely
in his bu&s;ine&s;s, I really think he is
happy in his lo&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14.&mdash;I have been deeply af|fected,
my Cecilia, within the&s;e two days.
If it had not been in my power to relieve
the di&s;tre&s;s I have been a witne&s;s to, how
unhappy would it have made me!</P>
<P>I was &s;tepping out of my chariot ye&s;ter|day
morning, when a young woman, who
&s;tood at my door, in an old linen gown,
pre&s;ented to me a little band-box, open
<PB N="287" REF="288">
and fill'd with artificial flowers; &s;he &s;poke
not, but the &s;ilent angui&s;h in her looks drew
my attention. She &s;eemed about eighteen,
and very pretty. As an appearance of in|du&s;try
I think doubles the claim which the
poor have to our compa&s;&s;ion, I took out of
her box a &s;mall &s;prig of je&s;&s;amin, very natu|rally
imitated, and a&s;ked the young woman
if &s;he made tho&s;e flowers her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She mode&s;tly replied, &s;he did. And can|not
you, child, &s;aid I, find any one who
would give you con&s;tant employment in this
way, without wandering about the &s;treets to
di&s;po&s;e of your work?</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, Yes, Madam, but I have a
poor decrepid father in jail, who cannot be
without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I live with him, and
only come out once a week to &s;ell my flowers.
I might go to &s;ervice, but he would die if
I were to leave him. Her gentle &s;peech,
her youth, and the unaffected tender &s;or|row
that appeared in her face, when &s;he
&s;poke of her father, touched me to the
heart.</P>
<P>I bade her come in, and taking her into
the parlour, was de&s;irous to a&s;k her &s;ome
que&s;tions.</P>
<P>You look, &s;aid I, as if you had not been
bred in poverty; pray, what is your fa|ther?</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, and with down ca&s;t eyes, re|plied,
a clergyman, Madam.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
A clergyman, I repeated what misfor|tunes
(for &s;uch I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e they were)
drove him to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation you
mention?</P>
<P>It <HI>was</HI> a misfortune, Madam, and not any
crime, an&s;wered the girl with tears in her
eyes; my father is as good a man as ever
was born.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked his name, and &s;he told me it was
Price.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity was excited by her manner.
I de&s;ired her to &s;it down, and relate to me the
particulars of her &s;tory.</P>
<P>She obeyed with a &s;en&s;ible politene&s;s that
plea&s;ed me.</P>
<P>About twelve years ago, &s;aid &s;he, my fa|ther
had a little cure in Berk&s;hire; he was
reckoned a fine preacher and a very great
&s;cholar, and what was more than either, one
of the be&s;t of men. In the pari&s;h to which
my father belonged, lived a gentleman of a
very great e&s;tate, his name was Ware; he
was a very worthy man, and had &s;o high an
opinion of my father, that he pitched upon
him to go abroad in quality of governor
to his only &s;on, then a youth of about nine|teen.
As my father had travelled in the
&s;ame capacity once before, he was very well
qualified for the employment; and had no
objection to the acceptance of it, but his
leaving my mother, of whom he was very
fond, and me his only child, then &s;carce
<PB N="289" REF="290">
more than an infant. The elder Mr. Ware
a&s;&s;ured him he would be a friend and
guardian to us both (and &s;o he was) and
that he would, in his ab&s;ence, allow us dou|ble
the income which my father received
from his cure.</P>
<P>This, together with the appointment,
which he was to receive as his &s;on's gover|nor
was too hand&s;ome an offer to be refu&s;ed,
e&s;pecially as the gentleman promi&s;ed he
&s;hould never want a patron in him, while he
lived; and every body knew he had intere&s;t
enough to make this promi&s;e of con&s;equence.
My father was then pa&s;t fifty, but as he was
of a very healthy &s;trong con&s;titution, he did
not think it too late to undertake, for the
good of his family, what he &s;aid was a very
trouble&s;ome ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I could not help interrupting the young
gentlewoman, to a&s;k her how it came to pa&s;s
that her father, &s;uch a man as &s;he repre&s;ent|ed
him to be, was no better provided for at
his time of life, e&s;pecially as &s;he &s;aid he had
before been intru&s;ted with the care of a pu|pil,
whom I pre&s;umed to be a per&s;on of for|tune,
as &s;carce any others are &s;ent to travel.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, he had a &s;mall patrimony of his
own, and that his original de&s;ign was to &s;tu|dy
phy&s;ick; but being per&s;uaded by the
particular love he bore a young gentleman,
to whom he was private tutor at the Univer|&s;ity,
to go abroad with him, he had for
<PB N="290" REF="291">
&s;ome years, while they continued on their
travels, been obliged to decline his &s;tudy.
When he had brought his pupil &s;afe back to
England, he intended to pur&s;ue it, and for
this purpo&s;e was preparing to go to Leyden;
but the gentleman, who really had an affecti|on
for him, declared he could not part with
him; and, that if he would con&s;ent to &s;tay
and take holy orders, he would get him a
living, which was in his father's gift (a no|bleman
then alive,) as &s;oon as it &s;hould be|come
vacant, of which there was a good
pro&s;pect, on account of the age of the incum|bent;
and that in the mean time he &s;hould
live with him. As the young gentleman had
been married immediately after his return
from his travels to a lady of a va&s;t fortune,
and was &s;ettled with a family of his own
about him, my father, who fondly loved
him, did not di&s;reli&s;h the propo&s;al; and,
without much difficulty, con&s;ented to it.
He now laid a&s;ide the thoughts of phy&s;ick,
and turned his attention to the &s;tudy of di|vinity;
nor was he in ha&s;te for the promi&s;|ed
living's being vacated, as he was re&s;olv|ed
not to take orders, till he was properly
qualified for the holy profe&s;&s;ion he was now
de&s;tined to. He continued thus $our years
with his young patron; the gentleman who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the living, though very &s;ickly, &s;till
holding it.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292">
My father being then inclined to go into
orders, his friend got him nominated to a
cure in town, the duties of which he con|&s;tantly
performed for two years, &s;till living
with his benefactor: but it was his misfor|tune
then to lo&s;e him. He was drowned
in cro&s;&s;ing a deep water on hor&s;eback, which
he thought was fordable. My poor father
had now lo&s;t, as it proved, his be&s;t friend;
though he then but lamented him as a &s;on
he loved; and I have heard him &s;ay, he was
more afflicted for his death, than his real fa|ther
was.</P>
<P>As that nobleman was well acquainted
with his &s;on's intentions, in regard to his tu|tor,
my father had no doubts of his fulfil|ling
them, e&s;pecially as he had given his
promi&s;e to do &s;o. About this time the cu|rate
of the pari&s;h in Berk&s;hire, which I
mentioned to you before, having a mind to
make an exchange for one in London,
where all his friends lived, propo&s;ed it to
my father, who had been at College with
him. As he had now no attachment in
town, and preferred a country life, he rea|dily
agreed to the change; and having fir&s;t
waited on the father of his late friend, to
remind him of his promi&s;e, which he again
confirmed, he went down to Berk&s;hire.
Here it was he fell in love with my mother,
who was the daughter of the rector, who&s;e
cure he &s;erved; &s;he liked him, and as her
<PB N="292" REF="293">
father looked upon him as a man certain of
preferment, and every way e&s;teemable in his
character, he did not &s;cruple to give her to
him.</P>
<P>In a few months after their marriage, the
incumbent of the long-promi&s;ed living died.
My father immediately waited on the no|bleman,
&s;o &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, that he thought
he &s;hould have nothing to do, but to thank
him for it; but that Lord told him, with a
pretended concern, that he had di&s;po&s;ed of
it, having heard, that my father was well
provided for in Berk&s;hire, and had married
a lady of great fortune.</P>
<P>He returned home &s;hocked and di&s;ap|pointed,
more on account of the family he
had married into, than on his own. He
now found him&s;elf at near forty years of age,
with a family coming on him, and no other
provi&s;ion, than a curacy of forty pounds a
year. My grandfather pretended he had
been deceived by him, and made that ex|cu&s;e
for withdrawing all his favour from
him. My mother had children pretty fa&s;t,
but they all died young, excepting my&s;elf;
and, as he loved her too well to let her feel
the inconvenience of &s;treightened circum|&s;tances,
he was content to let his own little
patrimony, which he had pre&s;erved till now,
gradually wa&s;te; for my grandfather never
gave her any fortune. At his death, which
happened a few years after, it appeared he
<PB N="293" REF="294">
could not, for he left but little behind him.
In this &s;ituation my father, having lo&s;t all
hope of being better provided for, with
the melancholy reflection of having thrown
away the be&s;t part of his days in a fruitle&s;s
attendance and expectation, dragged on a
life of ob&s;curity and toil for eleven years,
and then it was that Mr. Ware applied to
him in the manner I have mentioned.</P>
<P>I told this amiable girl, I was glad I had
interrupted the thread of her &s;tory, as by
that means &s;he had obliged me with &s;o ma|ny
intere&s;ting particulars of her family, and
then reque&s;ted &s;he would proceed. She
bowed with a pretty mode&s;t grace, and
went on.</P>
<P>I informed you, Madam, that my father,
having accepted of the tuition of Mr. Ware's
&s;on, prepared to attend him on his travels.
He took his leave very reluctantly of my
poor mother and me, whom he tenderly re|commended
to Mr. Ware's patronage, and
&s;et out with the young gentleman, having
given up his cure, as his ab&s;ence was to be
of a long continuance.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware, who was a truly good man,
was punctual in the performance of his pro|mi&s;e
towards my mother and me, and be|haved,
while my father was away, like a &s;e|cond
parent. His &s;on continued abroad up|wards
of four years, and returned a very ac|compli&s;hed
gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="295">
Mr. Ware was exceedingly plea&s;ed with
my father's conduct, for which he told him,
both his &s;on and him&s;elf owed him the ut|mo&s;t
gratitude. He was now far advanced
in years, and grown indolent from infirmi|ties,
he thought it better to be him&s;elf the
rewarder of my father's merit, than take up|on
him the trouble of &s;olliciting other peo|ple
to provide for him; and accordingly re|&s;olved
to give him an annual income of two
hundred pounds during his life. He told
him at the &s;ame time, that as his e&s;tate was
entailed, it was not in his power to confirm
this grant by a will; but he was &s;ure his &s;on
was too &s;en&s;ible of what he owed him, not to
promi&s;e in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to con|tinue
to him this income, when he &s;hould
come to his inheritance. The young gen|tleman,
who was pre&s;ent, hand&s;omely ac|knowledged
the obligations he had to my
father, and a&s;&s;ured him, he thought he could
never &s;ufficiently repay them.</P>
<P>My father, who now wi&s;hed for nothing
more than to &s;it down peaceably on a com|petency,
thought him&s;elf very happy; he re|tired
to his little hou&s;e in Berk&s;hire, where
my mother and I &s;till lived, and gave him|&s;elf
up to dome&s;tic contentment.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was punctual to his
agreement, con&s;tantly paying my father fifty
pounds every quarter&punc; He died in &s;ome|thing
le&s;s than three years; his &s;on immedi|ately
<PB N="295" REF="296">
on his acce&s;&s;ion to his fortune, being
at that time in London, wrote my father a
very affectionate letter, a&s;&s;uring him of the
continuance of his friend&s;hip. Nor did he
fail in his promi&s;e; for two years he was
punctual in his remittances to my father.
He did not, during that time, come down to
Berk&s;hire, having another country-&s;eat, of
which he was fonder. At this time I lo&s;t
my dear mother, who had been for &s;ome
years in a declining way; and tho' during
her health, as &s;he was an exceedingly good
oeconomi&s;t, my father might have laid by
&s;ome of his income, yet the frequent jour|nies
&s;he was pre&s;cribed to Bath, and other
places, for change of air, together with the
expence of phy&s;icians at home, put it out
of his power to &s;ave any thing: which on
my account gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s;
but, as he was &s;till &s;trong and hale, he was
in hopes he might yet live to lay by &s;ome|thing
for me. I was now about fifteen, and
the darling of my father's heart. He was
incon&s;olable for my mother's death, but I
endeavoured to comfort him, and at la&s;t in
&s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded. Mr. Ware, whom
my father had not &s;een &s;ince the death of the
good old gentleman, came down now to
revi&s;it his paternal &s;eat. He would not o|mit
paying a vi&s;it of condolement to his old
friend and tutor, and accordingly came to
our hou&s;e the day after his arrival in the
<PB N="296" REF="297">
country. Though I had &s;een him before,
as it was in my childhood, I had taken but
little notice of him; he is indeed a hand&s;ome
genteel young man.</P>
<P>The innocent girl blu&s;hed as &s;he &s;poke
the&s;e words; but I &s;eemed not to ob&s;erve
it.</P>
<P>She proceeded with a &s;igh. My father,
who loved him, was rejoiced to &s;ee him:
Mr. Ware behaved with a tenderne&s;s and
re&s;pect, almo&s;t filial, towards him, and was
very obliging to me. He continued about
a week in the country, calling to a&s;k my fa|ther
how he did every day. When he was
about to return to London, he pre&s;&s;ed my
father to pa&s;s a few weeks with him in
town: you are melancholy here, &s;aid he,
changing the &s;cene a little, will divert both
your daughter and you.</P>
<P>My father thanked him for the honour he
did him, but mode&s;tly declined it.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware gue&s;&s;ed at his motive, and told
him &s;miling, I know your objection, but, to
obviate it at once, I mu&s;t tell you, that I have
prevailed on my &s;i&s;ter to come and keep
hou&s;e for me, and I expect to find her at
home on my return. I knew his &s;i&s;ter, a
maiden lady, &s;ome years older than him&s;elf,
who had, on the death of his father, gone to
live with a near relation of theirs. My fa|ther,
&s;miling in his turn, told him, he had
gue&s;&s;ed his mind rightly, and &s;ince that was
<PB N="297" REF="298">
the ca&s;e he would not deprive his poor girl
(looking at me) of the happine&s;s of the good
lady's company for a while.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware &s;aid, we might go to town
with him in his coach, and as we had but
little preparation to make, we &s;et out with
him next day.</P>
<P>When we arrived at his hou&s;e in Lon|don,
he welcomed us with all the marks
of politene&s;s and re&s;pect. I was &s;urprized
we did not &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter the whole night,
but as &s;he was not apprized of our coming,
I thought that either &s;he was abroad, or had
not yet quitted her friend with whom &s;he
lived.</P>
<P>The next morning, at breakfa&s;t, Mr.
Ware made an apology for his &s;i&s;ter's ab|&s;ence.
He &s;aid, that the lady, at who&s;e
hou&s;e &s;he lived, was ill, and that &s;he could
not po&s;&s;ibly leave her till &s;he was better,
which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be in a few
days, as her &s;ickne&s;s was no other than
the con&s;equence of her lying-in; mean
while he hoped Mr. Price would not be
unea&s;y, as he was him&s;elf his daughter's
guardian.</P>
<P>Though my father was not plea&s;ed at this
excu&s;e, he however concealed his thoughts
from Mr. Ware; but told me if Mi&s;s Ware
did not come home in a few days, he pur|po&s;ed
that we &s;hould take our leave and re|turn
into the country.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
We had very hand&s;ome appartments a&s;|&s;igned
us; and my father was put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Mr. Ware's library; a very noble
one, where that gentleman knew he would
pa&s;s his mo&s;t agreeable hours.</P>
<P>For my part, as I did not care to go abroad,
'till I had a proper per&s;on for me to appear
with, I declined the offer Mr. Ware oblig|ingly
made of getting &s;ome ladies of his ac|quaintance
to take me to public places. I
expected his &s;i&s;ter every day, and if &s;he
came, as I knew my father purpo&s;ed &s;taying
a month, I thought I &s;hould have time e|nough
to &s;ee every thing; &s;o I cho&s;e to en|tertain
my&s;elf with working, and reading in
my own room.</P>
<P>But, Madam, I &s;oon found that Mr.
Ware was a very ba&s;e man. The third day
after we came to his hou&s;e, his behaviour to|wards
me began to change intirely from what
it was before; he took every opportunity of
being particular to me in his compliments.
I received them at fir&s;t with that di&s;tant ci|vility
which I thought would neither encou|rage
nor offend; I looked upon him as a
worthy young man, and my father's friend
and benefactor; and thought in my humble
&s;tation I &s;hould not be too quick at taking
exceptions, as there had nothing as yet ap|peared
in his behaviour which exceeded the
bounds of re&s;pect: but he did not pre&s;erve
<PB N="299" REF="300">
this long; on the fifth day he came into a
clo&s;et where I was reading, and there in the
warme&s;t manner declared him&s;elf my lover.
I would fain have turned his di&s;cour&s;e into
plea&s;antry, but he had recour&s;e to oaths and
prote&s;tations, and &s;wore he could not live
without my favour. I repre&s;ented the cruel|ty
of the in&s;ult he offered me in his own
hou&s;e, and begged he would leave me, as I
was determined to depart immediately. I
will not, Sir, &s;aid I, let my father know the
unkind return you have made for all his care
of you, but I can ea&s;ily prevail with him to
leave your hou&s;e. He fell at my feet, beg|ged
my pardon, and talked all that &s;ort of
&s;tuff which I have read in romances. At
length I got him out of the clo&s;et, and lock|ed
the door; re&s;olving never to &s;it alone,
without u&s;ing the &s;ame precaution while we
&s;taid in his hou&s;e, which I hoped would not
be above a day or two longer; for I conclud|ed
there was no &s;i&s;ter to come, and that this
was only made u&s;e of as a &s;nare to draw us
to town.</P>
<P>As I had a mind to try the young girl, I
a&s;ked her, how came you to receive Mr.
Ware's addre&s;&s;es in the manner you men|tioned:
how did you know but he intended
to marry you?</P>
<P>Ah no, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I could not en|tertain
&s;uch a thought; I have not troubled
<PB N="300" REF="301">
you with the particulars of what he &s;aid to
me, but young as I was, I knew too well
what it tended to; be&s;ides the fear he &s;hewed
lest my father &s;hould know of his pretended
court&s;hip, was enough to convince me what
his de&s;igns were, without any thing el&s;e to
guide me.</P>
<P>Did you like him, I a&s;ked? the ingenuous
young woman blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>I <HI>could</HI> have liked him, Madam, &s;he re|plied,
better than any body I had ever &s;een,
if there had not been &s;uch a di&s;tance between
us. I de&s;ired her to proceed.</P>
<P>I told my father that &s;ame evening, that
as I &s;aw there was no likelihood of the lady's
coming to her brother; and as I led but a
melancholy life, having no woman to con|ver&s;e
with, I had much rather be at home
among&s;t my neighbours and acquaintance,
and begged he would return to Berk&s;hire.</P>
<P>My father &s;aid, it was what he had deter|mined
on after completing our week in town,
unle&s;s Mi&s;s Ware came in the interim; I
have ju&s;t told our friend &s;o, &s;aid he; he &s;eems
to take it unkindly, and &s;ays, he is afraid he
has di&s;obliged me; but I a&s;&s;ured him, my
only rea&s;on was, that I did not think the
hou&s;e of a hand&s;ome young batchelor, a pro|per
place for a pretty little country girl, even
though her old father was with her. He a&s;|&s;ures
me his &s;i&s;ter will come, and wants to
<PB N="301" REF="302">
protract our &s;tay a few days longer; I hardly
know how to refu&s;e his entreaties, but I &s;hall
be unea&s;y till we are at home.</P>
<P>I told my father, Mr. Ware had too much
&s;en&s;e to take his refu&s;al ami&s;s, and begged
him to &s;tick to his day.</P>
<P>I gave Mr. Ware no opportunity of &s;peak|ing
to me the remainder of that day, nor all
the next; though he came to my clo&s;et door
where I always &s;ate, and entreated for ad|mi&s;&s;ion;
but I was peremptory in my denial,
and he went away reproaching me with
cruelty.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware made an apology to my father,
on account of his being obliged to &s;pend the
evening abroad, the fir&s;t time that he had
been ab&s;ent from us &s;ince we came to his
hou&s;e. He had twice entertained us with a
very agreeable concert, at which there was a
great deal of company, both gentlemen and
ladies. He had got it performed at his own
hou&s;e, on purpo&s;e to amu&s;e my father, who
was a great lover of mu&s;ic; but excepting
tho&s;e two mornings, I had never &s;een any
company with him, as he &s;aid he would not
invite &s;trangers, 'till I had got a companion
of my own &s;ex to keep me in countenance.
My father and I &s;upped alone; we were to
go out of town the next day, and we retired
to our re&s;pective chambers about eleven
o'clock, in order to go to bed.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="303">
The poor girl pau&s;ed at this part of her
&s;tory, as if &s;he were a&s;hamed to proceed.</P>
<P>I hope, &s;aid I, Mr. Ware did not violate
the laws of ho&s;pitality, by intruding on you
that night. Oh, Madam, he did, he did,
&s;aid &s;he, the vile wretch hid him&s;elf &s;ome.
where, I know not where, for it was not in
my clo&s;et. The hou&s;e-keeper &s;lept in my
room, in a little tent bed, which had been
put up for that purpo&s;e; but &s;he was not as
yet come up &s;tairs. The chamber-maid,
who had attended me to my room, told me
there was a great deal of company to dine
with her ma&s;ter the next day; and as the
hou&s;e-keeper was very bu&s;y in making jellies
and pa&s;try, &s;he was afraid &s;he &s;hould &s;it up
late, and hoped I &s;hould not be di&s;turbed at
her coming into the room. I always di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
the maid immediately, as I was not
u&s;ed to have a per&s;on to undre&s;s me, I went
to bed, but not being a very &s;ound &s;leeper,
and knowing a particularity I had, which
was, that if once rouzed, I could not com|po&s;e
my&s;elf to re&s;t again, I re&s;olved not to
attempt it at all, till the hou&s;e-keeper came
to bed. I placed the candle on a &s;tand near
me, and took up a book that I found on a
chair, by my bed-&s;ide, which I had been
reading in the evening. I had been a|bout
an hour thus employed, when I heard
&s;omebody treading &s;oftly in the room; as I
<PB N="303" REF="304">
had not heard the door open, I called
out, in a fright, to know who was there.
I received no an&s;wer; but immediately
Mr. Ware pre&s;ented him&s;elf on his knees,
at my bed-&s;ide, and half leaning on my
bed. I &s;hrieked out; I knew not what
he &s;aid, but I remember the mo&s;t wicked
of men held me fa&s;t, and talked a great
deal; I continued &s;hrieking ince&s;&s;antly,
and &s;truggling to get loo&s;e from him,
which at la&s;t I did, by giving a violent
&s;pring, which threw me out of bed on the
floor.</P>
<P>I had hurt my&s;elf &s;adly by the fall; but
dragging the quilt off the bed after me,
I wrapped it about me, and &s;hrieked
louder than before. The vile man tried
to pacify me, and &s;aid I &s;hould di&s;turb my
father.</P>
<P>Providentially for me, my dear father had
not gone to bed, for his room was a great
way from mine, but was reading in the
&s;tudy, which was over my bed-chamber.
He had heard my &s;hrieks from the fir&s;t,
but, little dreaming it was his poor daugh|ter's
voice, he imagined the noi&s;e was in the
&s;treet, and had lifted up the &s;a&s;h, and look|ed
out to try whence it proceeded. Finding
every thing quiet without doors, he ran
down &s;tairs, and was led, by my cries, into
my room, for my vile per&s;ecutor had not
locked the door, very well knowing none
<PB N="304" REF="305">
of his own people could dare to mole&s;t
him, and he did not think my cries would
have reached my father's ears, as indeed
they would not, if he had gone to bed.
Think, Madam, what my poor father mu&s;t
feel, when he &s;aw me on the floor (for I was
notable to ri&s;e) &s;uch a &s;pectacle of horrour;
my cap was off, and my no&s;e bleeding with
the fall.</P>
<P>The wretch was endeavouring to lift me
up, and I trying to re&s;i&s;t him. Good God
defend me! &s;aid my father, what is this I
&s;ee? Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, clinging round him,
carry me out of the hou&s;e! carry me out
directly from this mon&s;ter! My father
looked agha&s;t. You do not mean Mr.
Ware, my child, &s;aid he, it cannot be <HI>He</HI>
who has put you into this condition? Mr.
Ware quitted the room the minute he &s;aw
my father, which was not till I catched hold
of him; for he had his back to the door,
and, I &s;uppo&s;e, was in too much agitation to
hear him coming in.</P>
<P>My poor father, &s;peechle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
took me into his arms, and put me
&s;itting on the bed, then &s;tepping into my
clo&s;et, brought out a bottle of water, &s;ome
of which he made me drink, and afterwards
wa&s;hed the blood from my face, which he
&s;oon found only proceeded from my having
hurt my no&s;e a little.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">
When I had recovered breath enough, I
told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. His de&s;pair,
Madam, is not to be de&s;cribed; he tore his
hair, and was like a madman. Where is
the ungrateful villain, &s;aid he? I will go
this minute and upbraid him with his trea|chery;
he ran to the chamber door, but it
was locked on the out&s;ide. My father thus
prevented from going out, had time to cool
a little; he con&s;idered it would be to no pur|po&s;e
to reproach a powerful tyrant with the
injuries he did us; he re&s;olved to quit the
inho&s;pitable hou&s;e as &s;oon as any one in the
family was up to open the door to him, and
without ever &s;eeing his face again, commit
him&s;elf to providence for his future &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It would have been happy for us if he
could have executed this de&s;ign; but the
profligate man prevented us. We &s;pent
the remainder of the night in lamenting our
mi&s;ery. At day-light Mr. Ware entered the
room in his night-gown, for I &s;uppo&s;e he
had gone to re&s;t after he left us.</P>
<P>He told my father he was &s;orry for what
had pa&s;&s;ed, and imputed it to his having
drunk too much. I own, &s;aid he, I love
your daughter to di&s;traction, and could not
bear the thoughts of lo&s;ing her, as I found
you re&s;olved to go out of town &s;o &s;uddenly.
My father an&s;wered, I will not reproach you
as I ought, but my tender care of your
<PB N="306" REF="307">
youth did not de&s;erve this return: &s;uffer us
to depart out of your hou&s;e, and you &s;hall
never more be troubled with us.</P>
<P>Mr. Ware entreated to &s;peak with my fa|ther
by him&s;elf, and with much difficulty
prevailed on him to go into his &s;tudy with
him. They &s;taid together near half an
hour, and I heard them talking high; my
father then entered my room with tears
&s;treaming from his eyes. He threw him&s;elf
into a chair in an agony of grief. The vil|lain,
&s;aid he, has fini&s;hed his work&mdash;he has
&s;tabbed your father's heart&mdash;I ran to him
almo&s;t frantic; I thought he had made an
attempt upon his life. When I found he
was not hurt, I a&s;ked him the meaning of
his words.</P>
<P>He would have me <HI>&s;ell</HI> you to him, &s;aid
he; he would have bribed the father to pro|&s;titute
his child. Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, why do
we &s;tay under this dete&s;ted roof? there is no
&s;afety for us here, &s;aid he, come, my dear,
let us get out of the hou&s;e, and then we will
con&s;ider which way we are to turn our&s;elves.</P>
<P>My father laid hold of my hand, and I
followed him, ju&s;t as I was in my morning
gown. We thought if we could once find
our&s;elves in the &s;treet, we &s;hould be happy,
though neither of us knew where to go,
having no acquaintance in London. I had
never been there before, and my father had
<PB N="307" REF="308">
been &s;o long ab&s;ent, that he was forgotten
by every body.</P>
<P>We got out of my room into a little &s;ort
of ante-chamber, but found the door of that
fa&s;t locked.</P>
<P>We now gave our&s;elves up for lo&s;t; our
de&s;pair is not to be expre&s;&s;ed: we &s;at down,
and con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done. I
&s;aw now there was nothing that our ba&s;e per|&s;ecutor
would not attempt, and I told my
father I was re&s;olved at all events to make
my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>He &s;aid that the &s;hocking wretch had gi|ven
him till the next day to con&s;ider of his
propo&s;al; and he hoped, by that time, both
father and daughter would come enough to
their &s;en&s;es, to think he had made them a
very advantageous offer.</P>
<P>I told him in that lucky interval I hoped
to be able to effect my deliverance; which
I thought I might accompli&s;h, with his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
by tying the &s;heets of my bed toge|ther,
and &s;o from the window, &s;liding into
the &s;treet.</P>
<P>We were both plea&s;ed with this expedient;
but the next thing to be con&s;idered was,
what place I &s;houid go to, as I could not
make this attempt till late at night, and mu&s;t
go alone; for my father being in years, and
pretty corpulent, I could not think of let|ting
him run the &s;ame hazard, which might
have put his life into imminent danger, e&s;|pecially
<PB N="308" REF="309">
as I could not give him the &s;ame
help which he could afford me. This was
a difficulty, till I recollected a mantua-maker,
who was then making &s;ome cloaths for me;
and I happened to know where &s;he lived.
To her hou&s;e I re&s;olved to go (having fir&s;t
&s;ettled all my previous &s;teps) and to remain
concealed there till my father &s;hould get an
opportunity of coming to me. I told him
as I was the unhappy object on whom Mr.
Ware had de&s;igns, I &s;uppo&s;ed he would not
detain my father after I was gone. He
&s;hook his head, but &s;aid, he hoped he would
not.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ettled our little plan, we
were more compo&s;ed. A &s;ervant brought
breakfa&s;t into my apartment at the u&s;ual
hour, and dinner, and &s;upper, in the like
manner. We did not appear troubled, but
as carefully avoided &s;eeming chearful, for
fear of giving &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper was generally the la&s;t
per&s;on up in the family; &s;o that I was either
to &s;eize the opportunity before &s;he came up
to my room, or wait till &s;he was a&s;leep.
The la&s;t I thought the &s;ecure&s;t method, as
&s;he was an extremely &s;ound &s;leeper. I lifted
up the &s;a&s;h in the bed-chamber, to be in
readine&s;s, and clo&s;ed the shutters again.</P>
<P>Very fortunately my father, having re|ceived
his quarterly payment from Mr.
Ware ju&s;t before we came to town, had fifty
<PB N="309" REF="310">
guineas in his pur&s;e, half of which he in|&s;i&s;ted
on my taking in ca&s;e of any emergency.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock the hou&s;e keeper
came into the room where we were &s;itting,
as &s;he was obliged to pa&s;s through that to go
to the room where &s;he lay.</P>
<P>We heard her at the door, and my father
&s;uddenly changing the &s;ubject of our di&s;|cour&s;e,
made me a &s;ign which I under&s;tood;
and as the woman entered, affected to be
repre&s;enting to me the charms of wealth and
grandeur, whil&s;t I &s;eemed to li&s;ten with a
fort of plea&s;ure to him. He &s;topped when
the woman came in, but not till he was &s;ure
&s;he had heard what he &s;aid, for we ob|&s;erved
&s;he &s;taid at the out &s;ide of the door
a little while, as if to li&s;ten to our conver|&s;ation.
On &s;eeing us engaged in di&s;cour&s;e,
&s;he made a motion to withdraw, &s;aying &s;he
would come up again when Mr. Price
was retired to re&s;t; but I told her &s;he might
if &s;he plea&s;ed, then go to bed, as we &s;hould
not &s;it up long. But as I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had
orders to lock me in after my father had
left me, &s;he did not chu&s;e to do this. She
&s;aid &s;he was not &s;leepy, but would come
up in half an hour, and left the room
&s;miling.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity which I thought
was not to be lo&s;t. I repaired to the win|dow,
and hearing a watchman cry the hour,
<PB N="310" REF="311">
I waited till he came under it, and having
prepared a piece of paper, in which I had
put a weight to carry it down, I lighted it
and dropped it at his feet; it was fa&s;tened
to a &s;tring, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from it
above, was fa&s;tened another large piece of
white paper folded up, in which I put a
guinea, and in two lines written in a large
plain hand, be&s;eeched him to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in get|ting
down, for which I would reward him
with another guinea.</P>
<P>The lighted paper (as I concluded it would)
attracted the man's notice; he &s;topped and
took it up, and finding another paper hang|ing
to the &s;tring, looked up at the window.
I leaned my body out as far as I could,
and in a low voice, but loud enough for him
to hear me, bid him read it. He opened
the paper, and, by the light of his own
lantern, read the lines, at the &s;ame time
taking out the guinea, which I could per|ceive
he al&s;o eximined by the &s;ame light.
He then &s;aid, I'll help you, &s;tay a little.</P>
<P>He made what ha&s;te he could away, and
I was now afraid he intended to leave me,
and return no more. My terror was inex|pre&s;&s;ible
during the man's ab&s;ence, e&s;pecially
as &s;everal people in that interval pa&s;&s;ed by;
however, he &s;oon returned with a compa|nion;
and the &s;treet being now clear, I &s;aw
he had brought a &s;ort of plank, or board,
under his arm, which he fixed from the
<PB N="311" REF="312">
iron palli&s;adoes acro&s;s to the &s;tone work
which jutted out from the bottom of the
lower windows; on this he without difficulty
mounted, and being now much nearer to me,
he told me he would receive me, if I could
contrive to get down to him.</P>
<P>My poor father ha&s;tily ki&s;&s;ed, and ble&s;&s;ed
me, and having my apparatus ready for de|&s;cending;
he had the farther precaution to
fix &s;ome &s;trong ribbons, which I had tied
together for the purpo&s;e, under my arms;
the&s;e he held in his hands, whil&s;t I &s;lid down
by the &s;heets which I had fa&s;tened together
corner-ways with a knot.</P>
<P>The tru&s;ty watchman caught me in his
arms, and lifted me over the palli&s;ados, to
his comrade, who &s;et me &s;afely down in the
&s;treet.</P>
<P>It was very dark, but I could di&s;tingui&s;h
when my father drew in the linen, and heard
him &s;hut the window. I then told my deli|verer
that I mu&s;t beg a farther act of kind|ne&s;s
from him, which was to &s;ee me &s;afe to
the &s;treet where I wanted to go.</P>
<P>He readily complied, and leaving it to
his comrade to carry away the plank, took
me under the arm, and we got without be|ing
mole&s;ted to the mantua-maker's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The family were all in bed; when after
repeated knocking, a maid looked out of an
upper window, and a&s;ked us what we want|ed.
I told her an acquaintance of her mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="312" REF="313">
had urgent bu&s;ine&s;s with her, and beg|ged
&s;he would &s;tep down and &s;peak to me
from the parlour window. After keeping
me a long while waiting, &s;he at length came
down; I then gave the watchman the other
guinea I had promi&s;ed him, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
him, very well plea&s;ed with his night's ad|venture.</P>
<P>After he was gone, I told the woman my
name, and begged &s;he would let me in,
which &s;he immediately did. I without &s;cru|ple
acquainted her with the manner of my
e&s;cape, and the occa&s;ion of it; &s;he was
&s;hocked and affected with my &s;tory, and
promi&s;ed to keep me concealed till my fa|ther
&s;hould come to carry me to &s;ome place
of greater &s;afety; for &s;he &s;aid, as Mr. Ware's
hou&s;e-keeper was her acquaintance, I might
be di&s;covered at her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This terrified me exceedingly, but the
good natured woman gave me the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
a&s;&s;urances that I &s;hould be &s;afe for the
&s;hort time &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould &s;tay with
her. She invited me to part of her bed, as
&s;he told me &s;he had never a &s;pare one, and
I readily accepted of her offer.</P>
<P>I remained all the next day in the utmo&s;t
grief and anxiety, at hearing nothing from
my poor father. In the evening of the &s;e|cond
day, a porter brought a letter to the
mantua-maker, which &s;erved only as a co|ver
for a note directed to me. Seeing it
<PB N="313" REF="314">
writ in my father's hand, I eagerly opened it;
but oh, Madam, how &s;hall I tell you my
grief, and horrour, when I &s;aw it dated from
a pri&s;on! My poor father told me, that our
cruel per&s;ecutor, enraged at my e&s;cape, which
he did not di&s;cover 'till next day, had charged
my father with it, who immediately acknow|ledged
he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in delivering me from
ruin; that Mr. Ware, after treating him
with the mo&s;t injurious language, demanded
payment of him for the &s;ums he &s;aid he had
lent him from time to time &s;ince his father's
death.</P>
<P>To this my father making no other reply,
than that Mr. Ware knew he had it not in
his power to refund any of that money,
which, though it was a free gift he would
re&s;tore &s;ooner than lie under any obligation to
&s;uch a ba&s;e man, the villain was barbarous
enough to have him arre&s;ted, and &s;ent to jail,
where he &s;aid he &s;hould remain, 'till his &s;tub|born
&s;pirit &s;hould be glad to yield up his
daughter to him.</P>
<P>My father de&s;ired me to come to him di|rectly,
and to bring &s;ome body with me to
protect me by the way. I in&s;tantly obeyed,
and &s;ending for a hackney coach, the mantua-maker
got her hu&s;band, a decent trade&s;man,
and his apprentice to accompany me. We
drove directly to my poor father's melan|choly
habitation, where they delivered me
&s;afe into his hands. His joy at &s;eeing me a|gain,
<PB N="314" REF="315">
made him for a while forget the &s;orrows
which &s;urrounded us.</P>
<P>He told me, that after he had &s;een me get
&s;afe into the &s;treet, and had recommended me
to the care of providence, he had put every
thing out of the way which had a&s;&s;i&s;ted me
in my e&s;cape; and putting out one of the
candles left it in my room, that the hou&s;e-keeper,
when &s;he came up, might &s;uppo&s;e me
in bed; he then went to his own. He con|cluded
that the woman, when &s;he went into
my room, &s;uppo&s;ed me a&s;leep. Mr. Ware
was at home the whole evening, and had be|fore
that retired to re&s;t, &s;o that there was no
di&s;covery made that night.</P>
<P>My father now informed me that Mr.
Ware had &s;aid, when he fir&s;t made the odious
propo&s;al to him, that if I complied, he would
allow my father four hundred pounds a year,
and &s;ettle the like &s;um upon me for life; at
the &s;ame time, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, in&s;inuating
the threat which he afterwards put in execu|tion.
Thinking, no doubt, he &s;hould by
this intimidate my poor father &s;o much, that
upon reflexion he would u&s;e his endeavours
to prevail on me to comply; and it was for
this wicked purpo&s;e he was permitted, or
rather compelled, to pa&s;s the whole day with
me. I would not, added my father, relate
this particular to you, for fear your tender|ne&s;s
to me might &s;hake your virtue: but the
trial, God be prai&s;ed! is now pa&s;t; you are
<PB N="315" REF="316">
here, my poor child, at lea&s;t in &s;afety. We
have &s;ome money to &s;upport us for a while,
perhaps the wicked wretch may relent. If
he gives me my liberty I may &s;till obtain
a livelihood; and if I can get you receiv|ed
into &s;ome worthy family, that will pro|tect
you from his violence, I &s;hall be con|tented.</P>
<P>My father, unwilling to expo&s;e his un|grateful
pupil, and thinking when he cooled
a little he would be a&s;hamed of his conduct
and relea&s;e him, re&s;olved not to appri&s;e any
of his friends in Berk&s;hire of his &s;ituation;
but wrote a long expo&s;tulatory letter to Mr.
Ware, which he concluded with reque&s;ting
no other favour but his liberty.</P>
<P>To this, Mr. Ware wrote in an&s;wer, that
he was &s;till ready to make good his fir&s;t pro|po&s;als,
and &s;ince he now found he had got
his daughter with him, he &s;hould obtain his
liberty on no other terms.</P>
<P>My father &s;till loth to believe him &s;o lo&s;t
to humanity as to per&s;i&s;t in this barbarous re|&s;olution,
patiently waited another month; at
the end of which he again wrote him a very
affecting letter; but to this he received no
an&s;wer, being told Mr. Ware was gone into
Berk&s;hire. He wrote to two or three gen|tlemen
of his acquaintance there, informing
them of his deplorable &s;ituation, and beg|ging
them to u&s;e their influence with Mr.
Ware in his behalf. He did not di&s;clo&s;e
<PB N="316" REF="317">
the enormity of his behaviour, but only &s;aid,
that on a quarrel he had with him, he had
confined him under colour of a debt, which
it was not in his power to di&s;charge; this he
did as much in tenderne&s;s to Mr. Ware's
character, as to avoid exa&s;perating him more
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He ordered me at the &s;ame time to write
to an old maid &s;ervant, who took care of our
little hou&s;e in the country, to &s;end me my
cloaths, my father's books, and &s;uch other
things as belonged to him. As I had come
to town but for a month, and was in deep
mourning for my mother, I had left the
be&s;t part of my apparel behind me, and I had
taken nothing with me from Mr. Ware's
but a little bundle of linen; my father had
been permitted to carry his with him to the
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>As the furniture in this little hou&s;e was of
no great value, my father having purcha&s;ed
it as it &s;tood in the hou&s;e of the former
curate, he made a pre&s;ent of it to this old
&s;ervant, who had lived with him from the
time he married.</P>
<P>He received no an&s;wer to any of the letters
he wrote to the gentlemen; but I got a letter
from this old &s;ervant, at the &s;ame time that
&s;he &s;ent the things which I wrote for. And
you will &s;carce believe, Madam, to what a
height this abandoned wretch carried his
crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="318">
Not contented with having plunged my
poor father and me into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s,
he endeavoured to bla&s;t and de&s;troy our
characters in the country. He gave out
that my father, taking advantage of his
(Mr. Ware's) being a little overcome with
wine one night, had put his daughter to bed
to him, and would have in&s;i&s;ted the next day
that he had married them. To puni&s;h the
ungrateful de&s;igning old rogue, he &s;aid,
he had put him into jail, where he intend|ed
to keep him a month or two till he re|pented.</P>
<P>Though the re&s;pectable character my fa|ther
bore in his neighbourhood made this
&s;tory incredible, yet Mr. Ware's power and
influence was &s;uch, that people &s;eemed to
believe it, and applauded Mr. Ware's cle|mency
in my father's puni&s;hment. No
wonder then his letters were unan&s;wered;
they were &s;hewn to Mr. Ware, and laughed
at. The old &s;ervant who was &s;ure we were
both cruelly belied, lamented our unhappy
fate, but poor creature &s;he could do nothing
<HI>but</HI> lament. This la&s;t blow quite &s;ubdued
my father's courage; he fell &s;ick upon it, and
langui&s;hed many weeks in a mo&s;t melancholy
condition.</P>
<P>When he recovered a little from his &s;ick|ne&s;s,
he was &s;uddenly &s;truck with the dead
pal&s;ey on one &s;ide, by which he lo&s;t the u&s;e of
<PB N="318" REF="319">
his right hand; &s;o that I am obliged to dre&s;s
and undre&s;s him like a child.</P>
<P>When the money which we had brought
with us to the pri&s;on was &s;pent, we were
obliged to &s;ell mo&s;t of my father's books,
and the be&s;t of my cloaths.</P>
<P>We had repeated me&s;&s;ages from the mer|cile&s;s
man, by his vile hou&s;e-keeper, who u&s;ed
all her rhetorick to per&s;uade us to compliance;
but my father con&s;tantly repul&s;ed her, with
contempt and indignation; 'till at length
Mr. Ware, tired, I believe, with per&s;ecuting
us, left us to peri&s;h in peace. He &s;uppo&s;ed
my father could not hold out long, and he
then concluded I &s;hould be at his mercy;
for, as I never &s;tirred out of the jail, he had
no hopes of getting me into his power whil&s;t
my poor father lived.</P>
<P>If I had even had a place of refuge to go
to, I could not think of leaving him in the
wretched helple&s;s condition to which he was
now reduced. I thought therefore of apply|ing
my&s;elf to &s;omething, by which I could
obtain bread for our &s;upport. I &s;et about
making tho&s;e little artificial flowers, which
had formerly been one of my amu&s;ements;
and a woman, who was confined in the &s;ame
pri&s;on with us, and worked for &s;ome &s;hops,
undertook to di&s;po&s;e of them for me. She
had a daughter, who came often to &s;ee her,
and u&s;ed to carry her work and mine to the
people who be&s;poke it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="320">
In this manner we have langui&s;hed, Ma|dam,
near eighteen months; when hearing
lately that Mr. Ware was gone to Bath, and
the girl who u&s;ed to vi&s;it her mother being
&s;ick, I ventured out my&s;elf with the work.
The per&s;on who employs us did live in the
city, but has lately taken a &s;hop in this
&s;treet; and though it is a journey from
what I now call my di&s;mal home, I have
come to her once a week, for this month
pa&s;t, with the product of my own, and, I
may &s;ay, my fellow pri&s;oner's labours. She
this day told me &s;he was over&s;tocked with
&s;uch flowers as I brought her, and, having
picked out a few of the be&s;t of them, &s;he
left tho&s;e, which you &s;ee in the band-box,
upon my hands. I was returning home
very di&s;con&s;olate, when, to avoid your cha|riot,
which drew up clo&s;e to the hou&s;e, I
&s;tood upon one of your &s;teps, not knowing
it was going to &s;top; and &s;omething in
your countenance, Madam, I know not how,
encouraged me to offer my little ware to
you.</P>
<P>I have given you this affecting &s;tory, my
Cecilia, pretty nearly in the girl's own words.
I was much moved by it. If this be all fact,
&s;aid I, what mon&s;ters are there among man|kind!</P>
<P>She replied, It was all very true.</P>
<P>Though the girl was very young, and, as
I told you, had a mode&s;t and ingenuous
<PB N="320" REF="321">
look, yet, as I had &s;een &s;uch cheating faces
before, I would not yield up my belief impli|citly.
This &s;tory might be invented to move
compa&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t material cir|cum&s;tances
of it; and though I could not
&s;uppo&s;e &s;he had contrived it on the &s;pot, yet
I did not know but it might have been con|trived
for her.</P>
<P>I have a mind to &s;ee your father, child,
&s;aid I.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, quite compo&s;ed, Then,
Madam, you will &s;ee an object, that would
greatly move your pity.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e up as &s;he &s;poke this, &s;aying her
poor father would be very unea&s;y at her &s;tay|ing
&s;o long, and was preparing to go.</P>
<P>I was &s;eized with a &s;trong inclination to
vi&s;it this unhappy father directly. If, &s;aid I,
the ca&s;e be as &s;he repre&s;ents it, I cannot be
too &s;peedy in my relief; and, if &s;he has fal&s;ifi|ed
in any thing, I &s;hall probably detect her,
by not giving her an opportunity of &s;eeing
and preparing him fir&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not more than eleven o'clock; and
I re&s;olved not to defer the charity I intended.
I de&s;ired the young woman to &s;tay a while,
and ordering Patty to bring down a plain
black &s;ilk hood and &s;carf of her own, I made
the poor girl, to her great a&s;toni&s;hment, put
them on. I then ordered a hackney coach
to be called, and &s;aid, I would go with her to
her father. She looked &s;urprized, but not
<PB N="321" REF="322">
&s;tartled, which made a favourable impre&s;&s;ion
on me. She appeared decent, and I de&s;ired
her to get into the coach, which I ordered,
according to her direction, to drive to the
jail, where her father was confined.</P>
<P>When we arrived at this man&s;ion of hor|rour,
for &s;o it appeared to me, I let her go
up &s;tairs before me. She &s;topped at a door,
and &s;aid that was the room where her father
lay. I bid her go in fir&s;t; &s;he entered, and
I &s;tood without-&s;ide the door, where (as the
lobby was dark) I could not readily be per|ceived.</P>
<P>I &s;aw there a man of about &s;ixty; and,
as &s;he had told me her father was corpu|lent,
I did not at fir&s;t take him to be the
per&s;on, for he looked worn out, pale, and
emaciated. He wore his own gri&s;led hair,
and had on a ca&s;&s;ock, girded about him with
a &s;ilk &s;a&s;h. One of his hands was &s;lung in
a black crape; he &s;at pen&s;ively, leaning on
a table, with a book open before him, which
&s;eemed to be the Bible.</P>
<P>Upon his daughter's going into the room,
he lifted up his eyes to &s;ee who it was: he
had a fine countenance; candour and &s;ince|rity
were painted on it.</P>
<P>My dear, you made a long &s;tay, &s;aid he,
in a melancholy voice, I was afraid &s;ome|thing
had happened to you. What has de|tained
you?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, looking towards the
<PB N="322" REF="323">
door, I believe I met with a good angel, who
is come to vi&s;it you in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>I entered at the&s;e words: the venerable
man ro&s;e.&mdash;A good angel indeed, if her
mind be like her face! He bowed re&s;pect|fully.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, keep your &s;eat.</P>
<P>I took a chair, and placed my&s;elf by him.
He did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed,
but gravely, and mode&s;tly demanded to what
it was that he owed the honour of a vi&s;it
from a lady of my appearance; for, &s;aid he,
affluence and pro&s;perity &s;eldom &s;eek the
dwellings of the wretched.</P>
<P>I informed him, that having met with his
daughter by accident, &s;he had given me a
melancholy account of his &s;ituation, and that
I wi&s;hed to hear the particulars from his own
mouth. He made an apology for the length
of his &s;tory; but &s;aid, if I had patience, he
would relate it. I told him, I had come for
that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He then repeated to me every particular,
as I had before heard them from his daughter,
enlarging on certain pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;he had
but &s;lightly touched upon. He &s;hewed me
the copies of his two letters to Mr. Ware,
and that gentleman's an&s;wer to the fir&s;t, as
al&s;o the old &s;ervant's letter to his daughter,
which convinced me of the truth of every
thing he had &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324">
I a&s;ked Mr. Price, what Mr. Ware's de|mand
on him might amount to?</P>
<P>He &s;aid, four hundred pounds, which was
what he had received from him, &s;ince his
father's death.</P>
<P>Take courage, Sir, &s;aid I, you &s;hall not
long remain here.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, cried he, may God be the
rewarder of your goodne&s;s! but my enemy is
a hardened man; he is not to be influenced by
honour or virtue.</P>
<P>I perceived by this that the poor gentle|man
had no thought of my paying his debt,
but &s;uppo&s;ed I would endeavour to &s;often
Mr. Ware in his favour. Have a little pa|tience,
&s;aid I, and we will try what is to be
done.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted he would give me Mr. Ware's
letter, wherein he promi&s;ed to make good his
fir&s;t propo&s;al, if he would con&s;ent to yield
up his daughter to him.</P>
<P>I took my leave, and &s;lipped my pur&s;e,
which had ten guineas in it, into his daugh|ter's
hand as I went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I returned home, I &s;ent for
Mr. Warner, and related to him circum&s;tan|tially
the di&s;tre&s;s of this worthy father and
child. His hone&s;t indignation bur&s;t forth
again&s;t the ba&s;e betrayer of them both; hone&s;t
I mu&s;t call it, though he vented his wrath in
oaths and execrations on his head.</P>
<P>The&s;e are proper objects &s;aid I, to exerci&s;e
<PB N="324" REF="325">
our humanity on; I mean to pay his debt, and
make the remnant of his days comfortable.
You are a good girl, &s;aid he, you know my
pur&s;e is open to you.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, there is no need to tax
your genero&s;ity upon this occa&s;ion, the two
thou&s;and pounds you &s;o lately gave me is but
little dimini&s;hed. P&s;ha, p&s;ha, &s;aid he, I gave
you that to make ducks and drakes of; it is
not to go into the account; you know your
quarter's income is commenced, you may
have what you will.</P>
<P>I begged he would immediately write to
Mr. Ware, who is now at Bath, and make
him a tender of his money, that we might
get the poor man di&s;charged from confine|ment
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I gave him that vile fellow's letter, and
advi&s;ed him to let him know that he was ac|quainted
with the whole truth of the &s;tory;
which, perhaps, might frighten him into
better terms than in&s;i&s;ting on his whole de|mand.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner &s;aid, there was a merchant of
his acquaintance at Bri&s;tol, to whom he would
write immediately, and order him to pay the
money directly, if it was in&s;i&s;ted on. He
&s;aid he knew his friend would readily under|take
the thing, and execute it as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He called for pen, ink, and paper, and
wrote before me the following letter to his
<PB N="325" REF="326">
corre&s;pondent, which as he left it with me to
&s;eal, and &s;end to the po&s;t-office, I fir&s;t co|pied.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I beg immediately on the receipt of this,
you will take the trouble of riding to Bath,
and there enquire for a man of fortune,
one Ware, who is the greate&s;t villain in
England, and you may tell him I &s;ay &s;o.
He had kept a poor hone&s;t clergyman
&s;tarving in jail this year and a half, becau&s;e
he would not &s;ell his daughter to him. He
pretends the par&s;on owes him four hundred
pounds, which is a lie; for though he re|ceived
that &s;um from him, it was paid him
for value received by agreement. How|ever,
as the man can have no redre&s;s, I
reque&s;t you will immediately tender him
that &s;um, and get a di&s;charge, for I will
have the poor fellow out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I herewith &s;end you inclo&s;ed a letter
which that &s;coundrel Ware wrote; pray
&s;hew it to him, as a token that the par&s;on's
ca&s;e is known, and that he has got friends to
&s;tand by him.&endq;</P>

<OPENER>To Mr. William Blow, merchant, at Bri&s;tol.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 14, 1707-8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>My hone&s;t kin&s;man de&s;ired I would imme|diately
&s;end this letter off! I &s;uppo&s;e his cor|re&s;pondent
will have more di&s;cretion than to
let Mr. Ware &s;ee the contents, but I hope we
&s;hall have a good account of this negotiation.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 22.&mdash;I have been very impatient,
my Celicia, for an an&s;wer to Mr. Warner's
odd letter, and this day he received one.
His friend at Bri&s;tol I take it for granted acted
very prudently, for he &s;ays, that having <HI>waited</HI>
on Mr. Ware (which word Mr. Warner took
great exceptions to) he acquainted him with
his commi&s;&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time pro|duced
his letter to Mr. Price by way of iden|tifying
the per&s;on, as Mr. Ware at fir&s;t &s;eem|ed
not to recollect any thing of the matter.
He &s;aid Mr. Ware blu&s;hed upon &s;eeing his
own letter, in the hands of a &s;tranger; Aye,
I remember the &s;illy affair now, &s;aid he; the
man is an old hypocrite, and his daughter is
a young one; but as I never meant to ruin
him, I will forgive him the debt; and accor|dingly
wrote a full acquittal, which the mer|chant
tran&s;mitted with his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained but to pay the u&s;ual
fees, and get the poor old gentleman out as
fa&s;t as we could. Mr. Warner undertook to
do what was proper on the occa&s;ion, and in|&s;tantly
&s;et about it with an alacrity that &s;hewed
the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="328">
How wonderfully &s;hame operates on &s;ome
minds! this wretched man, Ware, whom
neither the laws of God nor man could re|&s;train,
has, by this &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion alone been
&s;ubdued. He found his ba&s;e conduct was
known by people whom he could not impo&s;e
on; and his forgiving the pretended debt,
no doubt was meant as a bribe to prevent his
di&s;grace from being propagated; for though
he could &s;it down and enjoy him&s;elf under
the accumulated guilt of fraud, perfidy,
cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion, and ingratitude; he was
not proof again&s;t the reproach and ridicule
of the world. This &s;hews at lea&s;t that he
was not long practi&s;ed in crimes of this sort.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 24.&mdash;I did not &s;ee Mr. Warner
again till this morning, when he entered my
room making flouri&s;hes with his hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Price and his daughter were with him
&mdash;Here they are for you, &s;aid he, and it has
done my heart good to deliver &s;uch hone&s;t
people from their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The good old man poured forth &s;uch &s;er|vent
prayers, and thanks for my kindne&s;s to|wards
them, that my heart exulted with rap|ture,
at being the means of conferring &s;uch
happine&s;s, as this worthy parent and child
&s;eemed to enjoy. The young girl's gratitude
was &s;ilent, but not le&s;s ardent than her father's.
She had kneeled down before me, and ki&s;&s;ed
my hands. I was greatly touched with the
<PB N="328" REF="329">
humility and tenderne&s;s of her acknowlege|ment.</P>
<P>I put an end to the grateful effu&s;ions of
the&s;e hone&s;t hearts. I have done but little
for you, &s;aid I, as yet; as Mr. Ware had the
grace to refu&s;e the offered &s;um, I &s;hall apply
that money which I intended for him, to your
future u&s;e, or your liberty will avail you but
little.</P>
<P>We &s;hall think of &s;ome method of &s;ettling
you comfortably for life; in the mean while
your daughter and you &s;hall be welcome to
live with me.</P>
<P>I &s;topped him from renewing his thanks,
and in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;aying no more on that
&s;ubject. The poor old gentleman is extreme|ly
feeble and langui&s;hing from his long con|finement,
but I hope with proper care, as
he is naturally &s;trong, he will recover his
health.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 1.&mdash;What a true delight &s;prings
from benevolent actions, my dear! I never
experienced &s;uch heart-felt &s;atisfaction as I
have received from re&s;toring comfort to the&s;e
truly deferring people. I have bought the
young lady &s;ome new cloaths, plain, but gen|teel;
and you cannot imagine what a pretty
creature &s;he is, now &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed. I find the
old gentleman a man of admirable under|&s;tanding,
and great reading. He has a &s;im|plicity
in his manner that is truly engaging,
but at the &s;ame time a politene&s;s that &s;hews
<PB N="329" REF="330">
he is no &s;tranger to the great world. Of his
integrity he has given convincing proofs.
Prai&s;ed be the Lord! who has made me, and
hone&s;t Mr. Warner, the in&s;truments of deli|vering
&s;uch a man from the depths of afflicti|on.
He mends apace in his health, but I am
afraid he will never recover the u&s;e of his
hand; though as it is not painful, it &s;eems not
to give him any unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 10.&mdash;I am infinitely charmed with
the conver&s;ation of this couple; for the girl
is very &s;en&s;ible, and prettily accompli&s;hed, I
wi&s;h &s;he were married to &s;ome hone&s;t man
that knew her value; for I find &s;he has &s;till
terrors on Mr. Ware's account, nor is her
father without his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>He &s;aid to me to-day, if I were to die, Ma|dam,
I would conjure you as my la&s;t reque&s;t
to take my daughter into your &s;ervice. With
&s;uch a pattern before her &s;he mu&s;t be virtuous,
and with &s;uch a protector I am &s;ure &s;he would
be &s;afe.</P>
<P>I told him he might rely on me, but that I
hoped he would live long enough to &s;ee her
happily di&s;po&s;ed of in marriage.</P>
<P>If I could &s;ee that day, &s;aid he, I &s;hould
then have no other worldly care to di&s;turb
me.</P>
<P>Here, my deare&s;t Cecilia, I will clo&s;e my
very long narrative. The pacquet is already
&s;welled to an enormous &s;ize, but you never
think them too large.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="331">
<HI>April</HI> 14&mdash;After &s;o many trifles, my dear,
as my journal for nearly a month pa&s;t contain|ed,
you will be glad of &s;omething a little
more &s;erious. I mentioned in my la&s;t week's
journal, that I had ca&s;t my eyes on a young
man, who I thought would make a &s;uitable
match for Mi&s;s Price, if he were approved
of by her, and her father. This per&s;on is a
linen draper in the &s;trand, a &s;econd brother
of my Patty's. You can't have forgot Harry
Main, my dear, whom we both knew when
a boy, remarkable for a &s;ober behaviour, mo|de&s;ty,
and &s;weetne&s;s of temper. He is ju&s;t
now out of his time, and his elde&s;t brother
has &s;et him up in a hand&s;ome &s;hop. You
may be &s;ure I am his cu&s;tomer. 'Tis on this
lad then that I have turned my thoughts, as
a fit hu&s;band for the amiable girl. I went
ye&s;terday morning to buy &s;ome linen for
Mi&s;s Price, and carried her with me, as I had
done once or twice before. After we had
made our markets, I told young Main, with
a freedom which a long acquaintance gave
me, that I thought he was &s;o well &s;ettled, he
wanted nothing but a good wife to complete
his happine&s;s. He replied, he &s;hould think
him&s;elf very happy, if he could light on &s;ome
good young woman as a partner for life. Why
do you not look out for one, &s;aid I? they are
not &s;o hard to become at. I believe, Madam,
he an&s;wered, I mu&s;t get &s;ome one el&s;e to do it
for me, my friends laugh at me and &s;ay I
<PB N="313" REF="332">
am too ba&s;hful to &s;peak for my&s;elf; but I
fancy were I to meet with a per&s;on that really
touched my heart, I &s;hould make a &s;hift to find
courage enough to tell her &s;o.</P>
<P>And have you never yet &s;een &s;uch a per&s;on,
&s;aid I? he blu&s;hed, and by an involuntary
motion his eyes were turned on Mi&s;s Price, of
whom I concluded his &s;i&s;ter Patty, as &s;he
often vi&s;its him, had given him the hi&s;tory.
He &s;aid if I commanded him to tell his &s;ecret,
I &s;hould know it another time.</P>
<P>This was enough; I a&s;ked in a joco&s;e way,
would he take a wife of my chu&s;ing? &s;ooner
than any body's in the world, Madam, he
replied.</P>
<P>We took our leave, and I a&s;ked Patty
when I went home, whether &s;he had ever
mentioned any thing about Mi&s;s Price to her
brother? poor Patty coloured for fear &s;he had
committed a fault, but owned directly &s;he
had told him every circum&s;tance of her &s;tory;
her brother having been very inqui&s;itive
about her, from the fir&s;t time he had &s;een
her with me; and added, that &s;he believed
he was downright in love with her.</P>
<P>I told her if Mi&s;s Price liked her brother,
and her father did not di&s;approve the match,
I &s;aw no rea&s;on why they might nod make
each other happy, as I &s;hould give Mi&s;s
Price a fortune worth the young man's ac|ceptance.</P>
<P>Patty &s;aid, &s;he was &s;ure her brother would
<PB N="332" REF="333">
rejoice at the offer, and that &s;he her&s;elf
could not wi&s;h him to make a better choice.</P>
<P>It only remained now to know how the
young lady her&s;elf &s;tood affected towards him.
I put Patty (for whom Mi&s;s Price had con|ceived
a great affection) upon this ta&s;k. I
thought &s;he would &s;peak her mind with le&s;s
re&s;erve to her, as I feared the obligation &s;he
thought her&s;elf under to me, might have &s;uch
an influence on her gratitude, as to prevent
that freedom which I wi&s;hed her to u&s;e; for I
was re&s;olved not to put the lea&s;t &s;hadow of
con&s;traint on her inclinations.</P>
<P>Patty &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that without &s;eem|ing
to have any de&s;ign in it, &s;he drew a con|fe&s;&s;ion
from Mi&s;s Price very much in her bro|ther's
favour.</P>
<P>Being now &s;ure that the young people liked
each other, I thought I might open my de&s;ign
to the old gentleman, which I did in few
words. How the good man was delighted
with the happy pro&s;pect which his de&s;ervedly
belov'd daughter had before her! he has
left the affair intirely to me, &s;o that I hope
to have the girl di&s;po&s;ed of very much to all
our &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18.&mdash;I am charmed with Mr. War|ner's
noble behaviour, I claim an intere&s;t,
&s;aid he, in the&s;e hone&s;t creatures that you
have taken under your protection. I like
the old fellow mightily, and admire the little
girl &s;o much, that if you had not provided a
<PB N="333" REF="334">
better hu&s;band for her, I &s;hould have been
half tempted to have taken her my&s;elf; but
&s;ince it is as it is, we mu&s;t do hand&s;omely by
her.</P>
<P>I told him I had enquired into the young
man's circum&s;tances, and found that about
a thou&s;and pounds would &s;et him forward
extremely well, and that this was the portion
I intended to give him with the young gen|tlewoman.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid he, I believe that will do; but
I mu&s;t make the poor thing a pre&s;ent my&s;elf
for wedding trinkets. And the old man too,
mu&s;t we not take care of him?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, how good you are? you
would remind me of my duty, if I my&s;elf
were forgetful of it. But I have already &s;et|tled
a hundred pounds a year on him.</P>
<P>Is that enough, &s;aid he? will it make the
good fellow ea&s;y?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, it exceeds his wi&s;hes; he intends
to live with his daughter, as his growing in|firmities
require her tender care.</P>
<P>Every thing is to be this day &s;ettled, Mr.
Price is exceedingly plea&s;ed with his &s;on-in-law
elect; and the wedding will be no longer
delayed, than till Mr. Main receives the
an&s;wers to tho&s;e letters which he has wrote to
his friends in the country, to apprize them of
his approaching marriage.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 26.&mdash;I am &s;ure my dear Cecilia will
rejoice with her friend in the acqui&s;ition &s;he
<PB N="334" REF="335">
has received to her own happine&s;s by confer|ring
&s;o much on a worthy family. The bride
is this day gone home to her own hou&s;e;
her delighted father with her. Their prayers
and ble&s;&s;ings poured out from truly grateful
and virtuous hearts, remain with me. A
reward, my dear, and a rich one too, for the
&s;elf-&s;atisfying part I have acted.</P>
<P>My worthy Patty, who&s;e merit alone rai&s;es
her much above her &s;tation, I &s;hall no longer
con&s;ider as my &s;ervant. She has been my
friend in the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t enlarged
&s;en&s;e of the word, and &s;he &s;hall continue &s;o.
I have hired another maid to wait on me,
and with a &s;ort of merry ceremony enfran|chi&s;ed
Patty, on the day of her brother's
marriage; for I had her dre&s;&s;ed elegantly as
bride's maid to her new &s;i&s;ter, and &s;he &s;at on
her right-hand at the wedding-dinner. I look
on her as my companion, but I cannot per|&s;uade
her to forget that I was her mi&s;tre&s;s.
She &s;hews this by actions, not by words.</P>
<P>[Here follows an interval of thirteen
months, in which nothing material to the
thread of the &s;tory occurs. The journal con|tains
only a continued &s;eries of &s;uch actions,

Arnold made of the great fortune which pro|vidence

<P><HI>April</HI> 28.&mdash;And &s;hall I really be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed,
my ever beloved Cecilia, as to &s;ee you at the
time you mention? Oh, my dear, after an
ab&s;ence of &s;ix long years, how my heart
bounds with joy at your approach! the two
months that are to intervene before we meet
will appear very tedious to me. But it is al|ways
&s;o with happine&s;s that is within our view.
Before I expected you, though I regretted
your ab&s;ence, yet did I patiently acquie&s;ce
under it, and could entertain my thoughts
with other objects; but I am now, I cannot
tell you how anxious and impatient to &s;ee you.
And yet, my Cecilia, we &s;hall have nothing
new to &s;ay to each other, knowing as we both
do, every circum&s;tance of each other's life
&s;ince we parted. Mine has been a &s;trange
one; but my lot is now fallen on a fair ground,
where, I hope, it will plea&s;e heaven to con|tinue
me whil&s;t I am to remain in this world.
The noble, I may almo&s;t call it, princely for|tune
that my kin&s;man has &s;ettled on me, will
enable me to leave my children greatly provi|ded
for, whenever it &s;hall be God's plea&s;ure
to call me away. Let me but live to em|brace
my Cecilia, and then, providence, thy
will be done!</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="337">
<HI>April</HI> 29.&mdash;Gracious God! for what am I
yet re&s;erved? My trembling hand can &s;carce
hold my pen, but I will try to tell you the
event which ye&s;terday produced.</P>
<P>I was but ju&s;t &s;et down to dinner; no body
with me but Patty and my children. A note
was brought in to me, which, they &s;aid, came
by a porter, who waited for an an&s;wer. I
opened and read it. My eyes were &s;truck
with the unlooked-for name of Orlando
Faulkland at the bottom; the contents filled
me with terror and &s;urprize. I know not
what I have done with the note, but he in|formed
me in it that he was ju&s;t arrived in
town, and begged I would appoint an hour
that evening to &s;ee him alone, adding, that
his arrival was, and mu&s;t be, a &s;ecret to every
body but me.</P>
<P>Troubled and &s;hocked as I was, I returned
for an&s;wer, by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger, that I
&s;hould expect him at &s;ix o'clock. I need not
tell you how I pa&s;&s;ed the interval till that
hour. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me, amid&s;t a
thou&s;and conjectures, to form one which
could probably occa&s;ion this amazing vi&s;it.
So &s;trangely introduced! &s;o unthought of!
and from one I imagined to be in another
kingdom.</P>
<P>Preci&s;ely at &s;ix o'clock, I heard a coach&s;top
at the door; Patty was in the way to receive
him, and pre&s;ently Mr. Faulkland him&s;elf en|tered
the drawing-room, Di&s;traction was in
<PB N="337" REF="338">
his looks! I ro&s;e to receive him, but &s;hook
from head to foot; and I felt the blood for|&s;aking
my face. He ran to me, as if with a
de&s;ign to &s;alute me, but &s;tarted back without
making the offer. I made a motion to a chair
for him, and &s;at down my&s;elf, for I was not
able to &s;tand. You are welcome to England,
Sir, I am glad to &s;ee you&mdash;&s;carce knowing
what I &s;aid. I hope your lady is well? He
looked wildly as if in horror at the que&s;tion.
Then &s;uddenly catching both my hands, he
fell on his knees before me, his eyes fixed
mournfully on my face, and it was &s;ome time
before he could an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I could not &s;peak; I bur&s;t into tears:&mdash;
there was &s;omething dreadful in his &s;ilence.
He ki&s;&s;ed both my hands, but I withdrew
them from him. Sir, Sir, &s;peak I conjure you.
You &s;hock me to death! I &s;ee I have, &s;aid
he, and I am afraid to proceed: you will die
at the relation. For God's &s;ake, Sir, explain
your&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>You &s;ee a man, &s;aid he, who&s;e life is forfeit|ed
to the law.&mdash;My wife is dead&mdash;and by my
hand&mdash;</P>
<P>I don't know whether he &s;aid more, for I
fainted away. It &s;eems he did not call for
any help, but by his own endeavours at la&s;t
brought me to my&s;elf, and I found him weep|ing
bitterly over me.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the la&s;t horrid words I had
<PB N="338" REF="339">
heard him &s;peak &s;till rung in my ears. I begged
him to explain them.</P>
<P>That wife, &s;aid he, that woman whom <HI>you</HI>
per&s;uaded me to marry, I caught in adultery,
and I puni&s;hed the villain that wronged me
with death. She &s;hared in his fate tho' with|out
my intending it. For this act of ju&s;tice,
which the law will deem murder, I my&s;elf mu&s;t
die, and I am come but to take a la&s;t look.&mdash;
What recompence then can you make the
man, whom you have brought to mi&s;ery,
&s;hame, and death?</P>
<P>His looks, and the tone of voice with which
he &s;poke this, made my blood run cold, and
my heart die within me.</P>
<P>I wrung my hands, and redoubling my tears,
I do not need your reproaches, &s;aid I, to make
me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable woman on earth&mdash;
What recompence indeed <HI>can</HI> I make you?&mdash;
None, none, but to tell you that if you will
fly this in&s;tant, my fortune &s;hall be at your
di&s;po&s;al, and I will take care to &s;upply you in
what part &s;oever of the world you &s;hall chu&s;e
for your re&s;idence.</P>
<P>And can you after all that is pa&s;t, &s;aid he,
per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch barbarity as to drive me from
you? or are you determined to &s;ee me peri&s;h
here? if that be &s;o, I will &s;oon rid you of this
mi&s;erable hated wretch.</P>
<P>He drew his &s;word like a madman, and with
a dreadful imprecation, which made me
&s;hudder, &s;wore that if I did not that minute,
<PB N="339" REF="340">
promi&s;e to bear him company in his flight, he
would plunge it into his brea&s;t, and die before
my eyes&mdash;Good God, what a &s;cene of horror
was this! I will, I will, I cried. I will go with
you to the farthe&s;t verge of the earth. I catched
his arm, fell down on my knees, and was more
mad, if po&s;&s;ible, than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I begged of him to put up his &s;word, which
he did, &s;eeing me almo&s;t dead with fear. You
know, &s;aid he, the means of dying are always
in my own power; take care you do not
trifle with me, nor plead in excu&s;e for fal&s;ify|ing
your promi&s;e, that you made it to &s;ave me
from immediate de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I be&s;eeched him to calm him&s;elf a little, and
to permit me to &s;end for my brother. Sir
George you know has an intire affection for
you, &s;aid I, you may tru&s;t him with your life
and &s;afety.</P>
<P>I had forgot him, &s;aid he; poor Bidulph!
he will be afflicted when he hears my &s;tory.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly wrote a line to my brother re|que&s;ting
to &s;ee him immediately. By good
fortune he was at home, and came to me
directly.</P>
<P>In the mean time as I &s;aw Mr. Faulkland's
mind was exceedingly di&s;turbed, I endeavour|ed,
by giving him an account of my own &s;itu|ation,
to divert his thoughts from the trouble
that preyed on them; for I was apprehen&s;ive
of his relap&s;ing into the &s;ame phrenzy that
had &s;o much terrified me, if I touched on the
<PB N="340" REF="341">
cau&s;e, and therefore cho&s;e to defer enquiring
into the particulars of his misfortune, till my
brother &s;hould be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Sir George was equally a&s;toni&s;hed with me
at the &s;ight of Mr. Faulkland; they embraced
tenderly; poor Mr. Faulkland wept upon my
brother's neck. It was ea&s;y to di&s;cover he la|boured
under &s;ome extraordinary affliction.</P>
<P>My brother looked at me as if for an ex|planation;
he &s;eemed to gue&s;s at lea&s;t part of
the fatal truth. Are you come to England
alone, Faulkland, &s;aid he? I prevented the
reply; he is alone, &s;aid I, he has a dreadful
&s;tory to relate to you. Mrs. Faulkland is dead.
I dur&s;t not a&s;k the manner of her death, till
you were by, to calm the tran&s;ports of your
friend.</P>
<P>My heart forebodes, an&s;wered my brother,
addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Faulkland, that the
ungrateful woman you married has betrayed
you. She did, replied Mr. Faulkland, but I did
not mean to &s;tain my hands with her blood,
perfidious as &s;he was; her death be on her
own head.</P>
<P>Sir George looked a&s;toni&s;hed; that &s;he is
dead I rejoice, &s;aid he, but how, my dear
Faulkland, were you acce&s;&s;ary to it?</P>
<P>We were that in&s;tant interrupted. Mr.
Warner pa&s;&s;ing by, called to a&s;k me how I
did, and as my brother's chariot &s;tood at the
door, I could not be denied to him, tho' I
had ordered that no body &s;hould be let in.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="342">
I was called down to him, and indeed was
not &s;orry to have an excu&s;e for ab&s;enting
my&s;elf a while, for my &s;pirits were quite over|powered.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner quickly ob&s;erved that &s;ome|thing
extraordinary had happened, and as he
was already acquainted with the greate&s;t part of
Mr. Faulkland's hi&s;tory, &s;ome particulars re|lative
to his wife excepted, I made no &s;cruple,
relying on his prudence and &s;ecrecy, of telling
him the cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; in which
he &s;eemed to take a friendly and even paternal
&s;hare.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I returned to the room
where I had left my brother and his friend.
They both &s;eemed in extreme agitation, they
were walking about.</P>
<P>This is an unfortunate affair, &s;aid my bro|ther,
and may be attended with dreadful
con&s;equences, if Faulkland does not &s;hew more
regard to his own &s;afety, than he &s;eems in|clined
to do. I have been per&s;uading him to
retire to a place which I can provide for him,
where he may lie concealed for a day or two,
till he is recovered from the fatigue of his
journey; for he has travelled night and day,
for the&s;e three days, without &s;leeping.</P>
<P>Sir George looked at me, and by a &s;orrow|ful
&s;ign which he made, I apprehended he
feared his unhappy friend's head was di&s;|turbed.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="343">
For heaven's &s;ake, Sir, &s;aid I, be advi&s;ed by
my brother, who loves you; &s;uffer him to
conduct you to &s;ome place of &s;ecurity; when
you have had a little repo&s;e we will both come
to you, and concert &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall be
be&s;t for your &s;afety.</P>
<P>He &s;natched my hand, Sir George is my
true friend, &s;aid he, take care that <HI>you</HI> do not
deceive me. I find my&s;elf giddy for want
of re&s;t, I am &s;atisfied to be di&s;po&s;ed of for
to-night how you plea&s;e. But give me your
word of honour that I &s;hall &s;ee you in the
morning.</P>
<P>You &s;hall indeed, Sir, I replied.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, an&s;wered Sir George, I'll
bring her to you my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He looked irre&s;olute, and as if he knew
not what to &s;ay; then turning to my brother,
and leaning on his &s;houlder, do, dear Bidulph,
carry me to &s;ome place where I may lie down,
for my &s;pirits can hold out no longer.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid Sir George, taking him under
the arm, my chariot is at the door, I will bring
you to a hou&s;e where you may be quite at
home.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland riveted his eyes on me, as
my brother led him out of the room, but he
did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>Sir George whi&s;pered me that he would re|turn
again. They went into the chariot to|gether
and drove away.</P>
<P>It was ten o'clock before my brother re|turned.
<PB N="343" REF="344">
He told me he had lodged Mr.
Faulkland &s;afely at a friend's hou&s;e in whom
he could confide, as he did not think his own,
in ca&s;e of a &s;earch, a place of &s;ecurity. He
&s;aid he had &s;een him in bed, and hoped a little
&s;leep would compo&s;e his mind, which &s;eem|ed
very much di&s;turbed. 1 reque&s;ted my bro|ther
to give me the particulars of that terrible
affair, which Mr. Faulkland had mentioned.
Sir George related to me what follows, tho'
Mr. Faulkland, he &s;aid, told the &s;tory but in|coherently.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;aid he had no rea&s;on to be
di&s;plea&s;ed with his wife's conduct for more
than a year after their marriage; her affection
for him &s;eemed lively and &s;incere; and he
had made her the mo&s;t grateful returns, it be|ing
the &s;tudy of his life to render her happy.
Her love abated not of its ardor, and he had
all the rea&s;on in the world, to imagine him&s;elf
intirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her heart.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Mr. Faulkland's hou&s;e in the country
was building, he had been invited by a neigh|bouring
gentleman, who lived at the di&s;tance
of about three miles from his own place, to &s;tay
at his hou&s;e; which obliging offer Mr. Faulk|land
had readily accepted, as by that means
he had daily opportunities of &s;eeing, and ex|pediting
his own improvements.</P>
<P>Mr. Bond (that was the gentleman's name)
had a wife and two or three daughters,
all very agreeable women; with whom
<PB N="344" REF="345">
Mrs. Faulkland had, by living &s;o much in
their family, contracted a great intimacy;
but particularly with the elde&s;t, a &s;prightly
fine young woman, of about twenty years
old. They had been three or four months
at Mr. Bond's; their hou&s;e, which was no|thing
more than a little lodge, was fini&s;hed;
and they only waited till it was thoroughly
dry, to remove into it, as Mr. Faulkland
had laid out exten&s;ive gardens, in the fini&s;h|ing
of which he propo&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf
&s;ome time; for he acknowleged to my
brother, he was in no ha&s;te to return to Eng|land.</P>
<P>During their re&s;idence with this gentle|man,
they had made two or three excur&s;ions
to town. On their return from one of
the&s;e, after an ab&s;ence of about a fortnight,
they found a vi&s;itor at Mr Bond's; his
name was Smyth; he was an officer, a gen|teel
hand&s;ome man; and they were given
to under&s;tand he made his addre&s;&s;es to the
elde&s;t daughter; of whom he had been an
admirer a long time, but dur&s;t not make
his preten&s;ions known to her father, till
having lately been promoted in the army
to the rank of major, the young lady's pa|rents
admitted his vi&s;its to their daughter.
She had long before that acknowleged to
Mrs. Faulkland in confidence, her attach|ment
to him. Mr. Faulkland, who had
learned this &s;ecret from his wife, was very
<PB N="345" REF="346">
glad to find that Mi&s;s Bond, for whom he
had a great e&s;teern, was likely to have her
wi&s;hes accompli&s;hed, as he &s;aw that Major
Smyth was treated with di&s;tinction by her
parents, who complimented him with a bed
at their hou&s;e; for he generally &s;taid two
or three nights with them, every time he
paid them a vi&s;it, as his regiment was then
quartered at a town about fifteen miles di|&s;tant
from their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Major, without being a man of very
&s;hining parts, had &s;uch talents as made him
acceptable to the women. He &s;ung pretti|ly,
was lively to extravagance, full of agree|able
trifling, and always in good humour.
Mi&s;s Bond loved him; and as he was con|&s;idered
in the light of a per&s;on, who would
&s;hortly be one of the family, Mr. Faulkland
&s;oon contracted a friend&s;hip with him, which
the Major, on his part, &s;eemed very &s;olici|tous
to improve.</P>
<P>The marriage was now agreed on, and
was only deferred till the young lady's bro|ther
&s;hould be at age, as he was to join with
his father in making a &s;ettlement on his
&s;i&s;ter. This de&s;irable event was at the
di&s;tance of four months; but as the lover
was in the mean time permitted to enjoy &s;o
much of his mi&s;tre&s;s's conver&s;ation, he
&s;eemed to &s;ubmit to the delay with pa|tience.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="347">
Things were in this &s;ituation, when Mr.
Faulkland, thinking it time to remove to
his own hou&s;e, propo&s;ed it to his lady;
but &s;he objected to it, declaring &s;he did not
think it &s;afe, as the hou&s;e had been &s;o lately
built. Though indeed it was now perfect|ly
well &s;ea&s;oned; for the &s;hell had been in|tirely
fini&s;hed &s;ome time before Mr. Faulk|land
had gone to Mr. Bond's hou&s;e, and it
was only the in&s;ide work, and a kitchen,
that was built apart from the lodge, that
wanted to be compleated. Mr. Faulkland
was unwilling to oppo&s;e his lady in any
thing; but he was the more &s;olicitous that
&s;he &s;hould comply with his reque&s;t in this
particular, as he thought he had ob&s;erved,
that the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Bond had, of late, be|haved
with more coldne&s;s towards her than
u&s;ual. Though he was far from gue&s;&s;ing
the cau&s;e of this, he thought it, however, a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on for their removal. He was
afraid they had already &s;taid too long; and
that, perhaps, notwith&s;tanding the good-na|ture
and ho&s;pitality of the family, they all
now &s;ecretly wi&s;hed their ab&s;enee. This,
tho' he intended to make a &s;uitable return
for their friendly reception of him during
&s;o long a time, made him re&s;olve not to
continue there; and the more &s;o, as Mi&s;s
Bond, who was pre&s;ent when he propo&s;ed
it to Mrs. Faulkland, &s;eemed to wi&s;h for
their departure; as &s;he di&s;&s;ented from that
<PB N="347" REF="348">
lady, with regard to her opinion of the &s;tate
of the new hou&s;e, and &s;eemed to think there
could no danger attend their immediate en|trance
into it. Mrs. Faulkland &s;eemed net|tled
at this, and immediately a&s;&s;ented to her
hu&s;band's propo&s;al; the next day they took
their leave of Mr. Bond's family, and re|paired
to their own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, from this period, re|marked
a change in his wife's behaviour;
&s;he grew melancholy and peevi&s;h; but, as
&s;he complained of not being well, he im|puted
the alteration in her temper to that
alone; and the more &s;o, as &s;he did not abate
in the tokens of her &s;eeming affection for
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Bond's family frequently vi&s;ited
them; Major Smyth always made one of
the party, and often came without them.
Though they lived but at the di&s;tance of
three miles from each other, yet as the road
for carriages between the two hou&s;es, being
a cro&s;s one, was very bad, the ladies were
often prevailed on, if they &s;taid late, to lie
a night at Mr. Faulkland's, and, in con&s;e|quence
of this, Mr. Bond and the Major
had frequently done the &s;ame, when they
were of the party.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Faulkland was far from
having any injurious &s;u&s;picion of his wife,
yet he could not help ob&s;erving, that all her
complaints vani&s;hed, when ever this family
<PB N="348" REF="349">
were at her hou&s;e. This, however, he
a&s;cribed to nothing more than her being
fond of their company, though he thought
a coolne&s;s between her, and the elde&s;t Mi&s;s
Bond, was &s;till apparent. The principals of
the family, however, behaved with their
u&s;ual frankne&s;s and good humour, and Mr.
Faulkland thought there might be &s;ome
little female pique between the two ladies,
which was not worth enquiring into.</P>
<P>As they punctually returned the friendly
vi&s;its of the&s;e agreeable neighbours, Mrs.
Faulkland always propo&s;ed pa&s;&s;ing the night
there, to induce them, as &s;he &s;aid, to u&s;e
the &s;ame obliging freedom at her hou&s;e.
Mr. Faulkland, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, ob&s;erved,
that his lady always ro&s;e much earlier than
u&s;ual; but un&s;u&s;pecting as he was, he was
&s;atisfied with the rea&s;on &s;he a&s;&s;igned for it,
that of enjoying the plea&s;ant hours of the
morning in a very delicious garden; a
plea&s;ure which they could not have at home,
as Mr. Faulkland's improvements were only
in their infancy.</P>
<P>The mutual intercour&s;e between the two
families was thus carried on for more than
three months, when the time drew near,
that Mi&s;s Bond and her lover were to be
united, and every thing was preparing for
the purpo&s;e. The young Mr. Bond was
come home from the college, and the hou&s;e,
<PB N="349" REF="350">
on this occa&s;ion, was more chearful than
ever. Mr. Faulkland and his lady were
there at a ball one night, when the latter,
after dancing a long time, complained &s;ud|denly
of being violently ill, and either really
did, or pretended to, faint. She was im|mediately
conveyed to bed, and at her re|que&s;t,
another room prepared for Mr.
Faulkland. He, extremely alarmed at her
indi&s;po&s;ition, came to her bed-&s;ide, pur|po&s;ing
to &s;it up by her the whole night;
the younge&s;t of the Mi&s;s Bonds offering to
do the &s;ame, but Mrs. Faulkland ab&s;olutely
refu&s;ed them both, and about midnight, &s;ay|ing
&s;he found her&s;elf inclined to &s;leep, in|&s;i&s;ted
on their retiring; nor would &s;he admit
a &s;ervant to &s;tay in the room, but contented
her&s;elf with having a candle burning on the
hearth.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland, who really had an affec|tion
for his lady, was impatient the next
morning to enquire after her health; he
found her in bed, the complaints of the pre|ceding
night all renewed.</P>
<P>The family were extremely di&s;concerted at
this unlucky accident, and expre&s;&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t
unea&s;ine&s;s, all but the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Bond,
who was &s;ilent; and heard her mother
and &s;i&s;ters condoling with Mr. Faulkland,
not only with unconcern, but a &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
&s;mile of contempt, which did not e&s;cape
Mr. Faulkland's ob&s;ervation. He now be|gan
<PB N="350" REF="351">
to re&s;ent &s;uch a behaviour, which he
thought very unkind; and told his Lady, he
wi&s;hed &s;he was in a condition to be removed,
as he was fearful, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, it
might be very inconvenient to the family, to
have her remain &s;ick in their hou&s;e; e&s;peci|ally
as it quite broke in on the mirth and fe&s;ti|vity
which were now going forward.</P>
<P>To this &s;he replied, that &s;he found her|&s;elf
&s;o very weak and di&s;pirited, which &s;he
&s;aid was always the con&s;equence of tho&s;e
faintings, to which &s;he had been &s;ubject from
her childhood, that &s;he could not think of
leaving her room. She made a &s;hift, how|ever,
to ri&s;e, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped in a day
or two to be able to remove.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bond, who was of an extremely hu|mane
and tender di&s;po&s;ition, begged of her
not to think of &s;tirring, till &s;he found her
health perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed: Mrs. Faulk|land
thankfully accepted her offer, and Mr.
Faulkland, though reluctantly, was obliged
to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>They remained thus two days longer,
Mrs. Faulkland's complaints &s;till furni&s;hing
her with a pretence for &s;leeping alone; and
under colour of not giving trouble in the fa|mily,
&s;he. would not &s;uffer a maid to &s;it up
with her.</P>
<P>Major Smyth, who had been in the hou&s;e
all this time,, had now &s;ome call to his regi|ment,
which obliged him to go to the town
<PB N="351" REF="352">
where it lay, and Mr. Faulkland heard him
give his man directions for their journey.</P>
<P>Mrs. Faulkland &s;till kept her room, and
had not left it &s;ince the time &s;he was fir&s;t
taken ill. It happened, that the chamber,
which was a&s;&s;igned for Mr. Faulkland, im|mediately
joined his lady's, and was only
&s;eparated from it by a wain&s;cot partition, by
which means he could hear the lea&s;t &s;tir in
her chamber.</P>
<P>The un&s;u&s;pecting injured hu&s;band, who&s;e
anxiety for his faithle&s;s wife, had always
made him watchful and attentive to her
motions, happened this night to be more
than ordinarily &s;o. The family had now
been for &s;ome hours buried in &s;leep; every
thing was profoundly &s;ilent for &s;ome time.
Mr. Faulkland, who hoped his lady was
&s;ettled to re&s;t, was endeavouring to com|po&s;e
him&s;elf to &s;leep, when he heard her &s;tir.
This immediately rouzed him, and, rai&s;ing
his head off the pillow, he found &s;he got
out of bed. Though &s;he &s;eemed to u&s;e the
utmo&s;t precaution, he neverthele&s;s heard her
very di&s;tinctly open her door, and go out.
Surprized as he was at this motion, no
other thought occurred to him, than that
perhaps Mrs. Faulkland:, finding her&s;elf ill,
had got up to call &s;ome of the female &s;er|vants.
Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this belief, he &s;tart|ed
out of bed, and ha&s;tily &s;lipping on his
<PB N="352" REF="353">
cloaths, ran into his lady's room, where he
found her candle &s;till burning.</P>
<P>As he concluded &s;he would pre&s;ently re|turn,
he waited &s;ome minutes in her cham|ber;
at length, perceiving her cloaths lying
on a chair at her bed-&s;ide, he was afraid &s;he
had gone out without putting any thing on
her, and though the night was not cold, he
was apprehen&s;ive, that in her apparently
weak condition, her health might be farther
injured.</P>
<P>On this account, he determined to go in
que&s;t of her; and concluding &s;he had gone
to the apartment of the female &s;ervants,
which was on the floor over that on which
they lay, he a&s;cended the &s;tairs as &s;ilently as
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As he was pa&s;&s;ing by a room on the top
of the fir&s;t flight, he heard &s;ome one &s;peak
in a low voice, and li&s;tening, fancied it was
his wife's.</P>
<P>As he knew not who lay in the room, he
made no doubt but that it was &s;he, who was
calling the per&s;on that &s;lept there; and,
without farther reflection, ha&s;tily opened
the door, and went in, with the candle,
which he had taken, in his hand. On his
&s;udden entrance, the per&s;on, who was in
bed, eagerly called out, Who is there?</P>
<P>He &s;oon perceived by his voice, that it
was major Smyth. He was about to make
<PB N="353" REF="354">
an apology for his intru&s;ion, when per|ceiving
his lady's wrapping-gown, which
he had &s;een her wear that morning, lying
on the floor, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant recol|lecting
that he had heard a woman's voice
when he was without-&s;ide the door, the hor|rour
of her guilt ru&s;hed upon him at once,
and without making any an&s;wer to the ma|jor,
he &s;uddenly drew back the feet curtains
of the bed, where he plainly perceived that
the major had a companion, though &s;he had
hid her head under the cloaths.</P>
<P>The major in&s;tantly leapt out of bed; and
though he &s;aw Mr. Faulkland was unarm|ed,
he &s;natched up one of his own pi&s;tols,
which lay on the table, and which his man
had charged that night, as they were to go
a &s;hort journey the next morning. Mr.
Faulkland, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his rage,
&s;eized the other; the mi&s;erable woman, ob|&s;erving
their fatal motions, threw her&s;elf
out of bed. Mr. Faulkland was too much
di&s;tracted, to be able to give a di&s;tinct ac|count
of this dreadful incident; all he can
&s;ay is, that major Smyth &s;napped his pi&s;tol
at him, which, he thinks, mi&s;&s;ed fire, and
he in&s;tantly di&s;charged his with more fatal
&s;ucce&s;s; for Mrs. Faulkland, who had in the
in&s;tant ru&s;hed between them, &s;hrieked out,
and dropped on the ground; and the Major,
reeling a few &s;teps, fell again&s;t one of the
<PB N="354" REF="355">
pillars of the bed, and cried out he has kil|led
us both.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;ays, that after this dread|ful
action, without knowing what he did,
he ran down &s;tairs, and opening the front
door, made the be&s;t of his way home on
foot. The phrenzy of his mind was &s;uch
that he thought not of providing for his
&s;afety; but having got into his hou&s;e, he
had no intention of going farther, when, in
le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, one of his
&s;ervanrs, whom he had left behind him at
Mr. Bond's, a faithful fellow, who had lived
with him many years, came to him, &s;cared
and breathle&s;s, having ran him&s;elf almo&s;t
dead to overtake his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, &s;aid he, for heaven's &s;ake, get
away as fa&s;t as you can: Mr. Bond's family
are all in an uproar; you will be taken, if
you do not make your e&s;cape this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Have I killed any body? demanded Mr.
Faulkland.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, an&s;wered the man, you have
killed my lady, and major Smyth is mortally
wounded.</P>
<P>I know not what I did cried, Mr. Faulk|land,
but I did not mean to hurt your mi&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I believe it, Sir, replied the &s;ervant, but
I fear no body el&s;e will, for that wicked
wretch, though they think he cannot live
many hours, would take away your life if
<PB N="355" REF="356">
he could. The report of the pi&s;tol alarmed
the family, and we all ran into his room,
gentry and &s;ervants and all; the major was
able to &s;peak, but my lady was quite dead.</P>
<P>The account he gives is, that my lady's
candle having gone out, &s;he got up to get
it lighted, and was endeavouring to find one
of the maid's rooms, when pa&s;&s;ing by his,
and &s;eeing a light, for he was but ju&s;t got
into bed, &s;he &s;tepped in; and before &s;he had
time to retire again, you ru&s;hed in like a
madman; and &s;eeing his pi&s;tols lye on the
table, you &s;natched them both up, and di&s;|charging
one at your lady, which killed her
on the &s;pot, you fired the other at him,
while he was leaping out of bed. I am
&s;ure, Sir, this is a fal&s;e &s;tory, yet, as the fa|mily
may all believe it, I beg you, on my
knees, to provide for your &s;afety. Mi&s;s
Bond was tearing her hair for her lover; but
I heard her &s;ay, &s;he was glad that wicked
woman (meaning my lady) had lo&s;t her
life.</P>
<P>They had &s;ent off &s;ome of the people for
a &s;urgeon, and I ran as fa&s;t as I could to
warn you of your danger.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t fellow, not contented with
urging his ma&s;ter, &s;oon &s;addled a very &s;wift
hunter, which he had in the &s;table; and
Mr. Faulkland, now convinced of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of flying, mounted it directly, and,
attended only by one groom, galloped off
<PB N="356" REF="357">
to Dublin, which he reached by &s;even o'clock
in the morning, and was lucky enough to
arrive ju&s;t as a packet, which was going off
with an expre&s;s, was ready to &s;ail. He went
on board, and landed at Holy-head in
twelve hours; from thence, without &s;top|ping
night or day, except to change hor&s;es,
he rode po&s;t to London, and pre&s;ented him|&s;elf,
in the manner I have already told you,
before me.</P>
<P>Such, my Cecilia, are the di&s;mal parti|culars
of this &s;ad &s;tory. My brother &s;taid
with me 'till it was very late; our time was
pa&s;t in con&s;ulting on mea&s;ures for Mr. Faulk|land's
pre&s;ervation. He &s;aid, he would ad|vi&s;e
him, by all means, to get over to Hol|land
as fa&s;t as he could; for if that &s;tory,
which the execrable Smyth had invented,
&s;hould be believed, and it was very likely
to gain credit in ca&s;e he died of his wound,
and per&s;evered in it to the la&s;t, Mr. Faulk|land,
having no witne&s;s to di&s;prove any part
of the charge, would be in imminent danger
of lo&s;ing his life.</P>
<P>I need not de&s;cribe to you the horrour in
which I pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t night. I ro&s;e this morn|ing
at day-light, and was but ju&s;t dre&s;&s;ed,
when I was informed Mr. Warner wanted
to &s;peak to me. I went down &s;tairs to him
directly.</P>
<P>I could not &s;leep all night for thinking of
your affairs, &s;aid he, without any previous
<PB N="357" REF="358">
&s;alute; and I am &s;o impatient to hear Faulk|land's
&s;tory, that I could not re&s;t 'till I came
to you to be informed of it, for I &s;uppo&s;e
you heard every thing la&s;t night.</P>
<P>I related all the particulars minutely as I
have done to you, Mr. Warner never once
interrupting me. When I had ended the
&s;tory, what do you intend for Faulkland,
&s;aid my kin&s;man? I know not what to do,
Sir, I replied, but this I am &s;ure of, that if
it were in the power of wealth to relieve his
afflicted mind, he has an undoubted right to
a large portion of the fortune I po&s;&s;e&s;s; this
I think my&s;elf bound to be&s;tow on the man,
who when I was de&s;titute, offered me his.
If we can prevail on him to take care of his
own &s;afety, which, when he is a little more
collected, I hope we &s;hall be able to do, I
mu&s;t entreat your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Sir, in helping
me to make him as ea&s;y as his unhappy cir|cum&s;tances
will admit of&mdash;And is this <HI>all,</HI>
demanded Mr. Warner &s;ternly? does not
your gratitude &s;ugge&s;t a warmer recompence
than giving him a paltry income?</P>
<P>I was &s;tartled at the que&s;tion, and not re|plying
immediately, you mu&s;t marry him,
&s;aid he in a peremptory tone; there is no|thing
now to hinder you; the heavy mi&s;|fortune
which has fallen upon him, puts it in
your power to make him &s;uch a return as his
pro&s;perous days would not have allowed you.
You can confer an obligation on him now;
<PB N="358" REF="359">
&s;o <HI>that</HI> &s;cruple is rubbed out. As for any
former idle a&s;per&s;ions, you have already done
more than enough, to convince the world
they were without foundation. I could wi&s;h
indeed that jezebel of a wife had been cut
off in the common way; but &s;ince he was
guiltle&s;s in his intentions, it would be bar|barous
to make <HI>that</HI> an objection, and I dare
an&s;wer for it, all mankind will acquit him,
though the law perhaps may not, of that
&s;coundrel's death, who &s;o well de&s;erved it at
his hands.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Warner, that though Mr.
Faulkland had propo&s;ed &s;omething like
this, I was &s;ure it was owing to his di&s;|tracted
mind, for that he had at fir&s;t de|clared
he only came to take a la&s;t look at me,
and that I hoped, when he came to the cool
u&s;e of his rea&s;on, he would be far from urg|ing
&s;uch a reque&s;t&mdash;The more are you bound
then, &s;aid he, interrupting me, to deal ge|nerou&s;ly
by him&mdash;What does your brother
&s;ay upon the &s;ubject? He has not touched
upon it, I replied, I was &s;o taken up with
hearing Mr. Faulkland's melancholy &s;tory
from my brother, that I mentioned not to
him his wild propo&s;al; and as Sir George
told me, Mr. Faulkland was much more
compo&s;ed when he left him to his re&s;t, I
pre&s;ume he hinted nothing of that kind to
my brother.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="360">
Ay, ay, cried Mr. Warner, Sir George
to be &s;ure will change his note. Faulkland
is now a fallen man, therefore depend upon
it he will not be for your marrying him;
but for this very rea&s;on, I in&s;i&s;t on your do|ing
a noble thing. If you have a grain of
honour, or of gratitude in you, you will not
he&s;itate a moment. I will not de&s;ire you,
continued he, finding me &s;ilent, to carry
your gratitude &s;o far as to marry a madman,
if he &s;hould prove &s;o; but if on your vi&s;it
to him this morning, you find him compo&s;|ed,
and in his right mind, make him a
frank offer of your hand, and &s;ee you do it
hand&s;omely; con&s;ult not George, upon the
&s;ubject, I will have it all <HI>my</HI> doing. Go,
added he, if I did not know that at the bot|tom
of your heart you <HI>love</HI> Faulkland, I
would not make this a point with you; but
notwith&s;tanding all your pretended demurs I
am &s;ure that is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be di&s;ingenuous to deny it, an|&s;wered
I; far from doing &s;o, I will own that
I &s;hould prefer him before all the world, if
the &s;trangene&s;s of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation did
not frighten me. Trouble not your head
about that, cried Mr. Warner, if the man
is in his &s;en&s;es, do as I bid you, and take
care that you acquit your&s;elf with honour.</P>
<P>He left me without waiting for a reply.
What can I &s;ay or do, my Cecilia? my heart
and my rea&s;on are at variance. What a
<PB N="360" REF="361">
&s;trange dilemma am I driven to? nobody
to advi&s;e me. Mr. Warner precipitate and
fanciful in his determinations, urges me on
to I know not what. Marry Mr. Faulkland!
receive a hand &s;tained with&mdash;Oh the very
thought is terrible!</P>
<P>What would the world &s;ay to &s;uch an
union? it cannot be. He will not &s;ure
when he comes to the u&s;e of his cooler rea|&s;on
in&s;i&s;t upon a promi&s;e, which my own ter|rour,
and his de&s;peration, extorted from me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t try to convince Mr. Warner's
judgment; I hope he will not ob&s;tinately
per&s;i&s;t in pre&s;&s;ing me to what I dare not
comply with &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
&hellip;&hellip;.. My brother is ju&s;t come to
carry me to Mr. Faulkland. Heaven grant
I may find him re&s;tored to his right
mind! &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.
&hellip;. Ju&s;t returned from my vi&s;it to Mr.
Faulkland. What a &s;cene! he wrung my
very heart. I would I had never &s;een him.</P>
<P>We found him up, and walking about
his room; his looks much more compo&s;ed
than they were la&s;t night.</P>
<P>On our entering his chamber, his eyes
&s;parkled with plea&s;ure. He ran to my bro|ther,
and embraced him. Thank you, my
dear, dear Bidulph, &s;aid he, you at length
give her to me, and with her own con&s;ent
too. My bride! turning pa&s;&s;ionately to me,
and &s;natching my hand.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="362">
My brother &s;eemed &s;hocked, and ca&s;t his
eyes mournfully at me: mine moi&s;tened, and
I was obliged to apply my handkerchief to
them, turning my head away.</P>
<P>Tears! cried Mr. Faulkland, in a tone of
&s;urprize, and on our wedding-day! I could
not bear this, I &s;obbed aloud. My brother
was willing, if po&s;&s;ible, to give his thoughts
another turn, for not knowing what had
pa&s;&s;ed the day before, he thought this was
&s;ome &s;udden &s;tart of phrenzy.</P>
<P>My dear Faulkland, &s;aid he, you affect
my &s;i&s;ter too much; we have been con&s;ult|ing
for your &s;afety, and came to talk with
you upon it.</P>
<P>I think there is no time to be lo&s;t, and
that you ought immediately to retire into
Holland.</P>
<P>I am ready, replied Mr. Faulkland, but
Mrs. Arnold goes with me, I have her pro|mi&s;e
for it.</P>
<P>Sidney &s;hall follow you, an&s;wered my bro|ther,
making a motion to me to &s;hew he
would have me humour him in his ravings.
I will not go without her, cried Mr. Faulk|land;
the univer&s;e &s;hall not now part us.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with apprehen&s;ion,
and knew not what reply to make; my bro|ther
looked confounded, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland approached me, and with
a look of gloomy de&s;pair, you are both
mute, &s;aid he, Bidulph, I always thought
<PB N="362" REF="363">
<HI>you</HI> loved me. Mrs. Arnold I hoped did
not wi&s;h my death; but I am deceived in
you both&mdash;I have no farther bu&s;ine&s;s with
life&mdash;The friend I mo&s;t confided in betrays
me; the woman whom my &s;oul wor&s;hips,
and to whom I &s;acrificed all my hopes of
happine&s;s, repays me with ingratitude. Why
&s;hould &s;uch a wretch any longer &s;ubmit to
life? I have borne it too long already; but
there's my remedy, pointing furiou&s;ly to
his &s;word, which lay in the &s;cabbard on a
table.</P>
<P>I could no longer contain my&s;elf, but
bur&s;ting into tears, Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, accu&s;e
me not of ingratitude; I would to heaven
<HI>my</HI> death could repair the heavy afflictions I
have brought upon you; if it could, I would
welcome it this hour. Your reproaches, cruel
as they are, I forgive. I own my&s;elf the
unhappy cau&s;e of all your misfortunes; we
have been mutually fatal to each other. You
know I always valued and e&s;teemed you,
and have in your calamity already been &s;uffi|ciently
puni&s;hed for the &s;hare I have had in
bringing it on you. What &s;hall I &s;ay to
you, Sir? my whole fortune I think too
&s;mall, too poor a recompence, to the man
who has obliged me beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of
return. Yet what have I to offer more?
can you, Sir, can you urge me to a mar|riage
at &s;o &s;trange a juncture? think how
it will expo&s;e us both to cen&s;ure. Your long
<PB N="363" REF="364">
attachment to me has not been a &s;ecret.
Think what dreadful con&s;tructions may be
put on <HI>your</HI> conduct, nay, on <HI>mine,</HI> &s;hould
a union now take place, brought about, as
it mu&s;t appear, by &s;o terrible an event.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was &s;ilent, his eyes fixed
on the ground. My brother took up the
argument. Indeed, my dear Faulkland,
my &s;i&s;ter has rea&s;on for her fears. You
know I ever was your &s;incere friend; you
know too I always was of opinion that Sid|ney
ought to have been your wife; her for|mer
objections I thought were romantic &s;cru|ples,
and hardly forgave her refu&s;ing you.
The pre&s;ent ob&s;tacle has more weight in
it&mdash;Do not mi&s;take me, added he ha&s;tily
(&s;eeing Mr. Faulkland rai&s;e his eyes full of
re&s;entment at him) I wi&s;h my &s;i&s;ter &s;till to
be yours, and will con&s;ent to your marriage
with my whole heart; but let me conjure
you to take a more favourable juncture:
withdraw your&s;elf but for the pre&s;ent; your
affairs may not be &s;o de&s;perate as you ima|gine.
If that villain Smyth &s;hould chance to
recover, perhaps his con&s;cience may awaken
remor&s;e, and he may be prevailed on to
do you ju&s;tice. In that ca&s;e you mu&s;t be
cleared from the mo&s;t di&s;tant imputation
of what my &s;i&s;ter hinted at, and what has
but too ju&s;tly alarmed her. Cleared as your
character will then be, and con&s;cious as we
both are of the innocence of your intentions,
<PB N="364" REF="365">
there will remain no bar to Mrs. Arnold's
giving you her hand.</P>
<P>Smyth <HI>cannot</HI> recover, interrupted Mr.
Faulkland, &s;ullenly&mdash;there is no hope can
&s;pring from that. Then, an&s;wered my bro|ther,
at wor&s;t you can but live abroad; all
parts of the world are alike to &s;uch a philo|&s;opher
as my &s;i&s;ter is; and probably circum|&s;tanced
as your marriage will appear, &s;he
may like be&s;t to re&s;ide out of England.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;hook his head, and with
a &s;mile of indignation, leave me, Bidulph,
cried he, I cannot bear <HI>your</HI> attempting to
deceive me. You think me mad, and are
cruel enough to endeavour at impo&s;ing on
me&mdash;I know my mind is di&s;turbed&mdash;but
who has driven me to de&s;pair! to madne&s;s!
to death! and he ca&s;t a look at me that chilled
my blood.</P>
<P>Be &s;atisfied, madam, you &s;hall &s;oon be
rid of this fatal&mdash;hated&mdash;betrayed&mdash;aban|doned
wretch! he &s;poke this with his hands
gra&s;ped eagerly together, and his eyes lifted
up to heaven. Then &s;triking his brea&s;t, he
bur&s;t into tears, and ru&s;hing &s;uddenly into
his clo&s;et, he &s;hut the door violently, locking
it on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>He wept aloud, and his agonies reduced
me almo&s;t to the &s;ame condition with him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I begged my brother would endeavour to
prevail on him to open the door, for I was
<PB N="365" REF="366">
fearful of his making &s;ome dreadful attempt
upon his own life; but Sir George a little
quieted my fears, by &s;hewing me his &s;word,
which &s;till lay on the table, and which, at
my de&s;ire, he put out of the way.</P>
<P>My brother approached the clo&s;et door,
and in the mo&s;t &s;oothing language be&s;eeched
him to open it; but he could get no other
an&s;wer from Mr. Faulkland, than to beg he
would leave him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I found this was not a time for arguing.
I told my brother, we had better &s;uffer him
to vent his pa&s;&s;ion alone, and that, perhaps,
when he had time to reflect a little on what
had been &s;aid, he would permit his cooler
rea&s;on to govern him.</P>
<P>Sir George was very unwilling to leave
him in &s;uch a di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind; he
renewed his efforts to per&s;uade him to come
out of the clo&s;et, but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you to leave me, Sir George,
&s;aid he, I am not in a condition to talk&mdash;I
cannot bear the &s;ight of Mrs. Arnold&mdash;let
me recover my&s;elf&mdash;another time perhaps I
may be better able to di&s;cour&s;e with you.</P>
<P>Will you promi&s;e me then, replied my
brother, that you will in the interim do no|thing
that may be injurious to your life or
health? Indeed, my dear Faulkland, you
di&s;tre&s;s my &s;i&s;ter and me more than you
can imagine. Name the hour when you
will permit me to come to you again; and
<PB N="366" REF="367">
for heaven's &s;ake think of your own imme|diate
pre&s;ervation: <HI>that</HI> once &s;ecured, there
is nothing which my &s;i&s;ter and I will not af|terwards
do to make you happy&mdash;Can I rely
on you, Faulkland? do you promi&s;e me not
to be ra&s;h? You have my &s;word in your po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
an&s;wered Mr. Faulkland, (&s;till &s;peak|ing
within the clo&s;et) I have no other weapon
about me&mdash;leave me, Sir George&mdash;I cannot
talk.</P>
<P>Say but that you wi&s;h to &s;ee me again,
replied my brother, and I will go, and give
you no further trouble. Mr. Faulkland
&s;ighed deeply. Say, I wi&s;h to &s;ee you! he
repeated, ah, Bidulph! and his voice &s;eemed
choaked. My brother could not refrain from
tears. I will come to you in the evening,
Faulkland&mdash;You will find me your true
friend.&mdash;I &s;hould be loath to lay you under
any re&s;traint here, in the hou&s;e of my friend:
do but &s;ay there is no need of it. Promi&s;e
me&mdash;the &s;lighte&s;t word will &s;uffice. I know
my dear Faulkland will not break his word.</P>
<P>Well&mdash;I will not attempt my life, cried
he impatiently, let that &s;atisfy you&mdash;leave
me, and let me not be expo&s;ed to any in&s;ults
here.</P>
<P>I leave you, an&s;wered my brother, and
hope to find you more compo&s;ed a few hours
hence. Mrs. Arnold too begs you will be
calm, and think of pre&s;erving a life which is
&s;o dear to us both.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="368">
Mr. Faulkland was &s;ilent, and my brother
and I withdrew; he thought it be&s;t I &s;hould
not &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>Sir George left me at home, and &s;aid he
would call again on Mr. Faulkland in the
afternoon, and bring me word how he &s;hould
find him. My brother is exceedingly affect|ed
with his &s;ituation, and &s;ays, he knows
not what to advi&s;e. He is fearful that Mr.
Falkland's phrenzy is not to be calmed,
but by con&s;enting to marry him, and cir|cum&s;tanced
as he now is, that thought is
terrible. Yet, if I per&s;i&s;t in my refu&s;al, I
drive the noble&s;t of minds to de&s;peration.
Oh, my Cecilia, is this the return I ought
to make to the mo&s;t generous of men?
who&s;e &s;ervent love for me has been a con|&s;tant
&s;ource of torment to him for &s;o many
years? Yet how can I yield him my hand?
All my former &s;cruples, weighty as they ap|peared
to me, were light to the dreadful bar
that now interpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Had that ill-fated woman died the com|mon
way, with what joy, what exultation
could I have rewarded his hone&s;t per&s;ever|ing
love! all my duties fulfilled, obedience
to my mother, ju&s;tice to the woman I thought
injured, reverence to the memory of my
hu&s;band, the re&s;pect due to my own cha|racter.
Should I not, my Cecilia, after thus
being acquitted of all other obligations, have
been to blame, if, after a &s;eries of misfor|tunes,
<PB N="368" REF="369">
all brought on by my &s;trict adherence
to tho&s;e duties; &s;hould I not have been to
blame for refu&s;ing at length to do ju&s;tice to
the mo&s;t de&s;erving of men? When I reflect
on the pa&s;t, when I &s;urvey the pre&s;ent, and
my foreboding heart whi&s;pers to me the
future &s;ufferings of our dear unhappy Mr.
Faulkland, all my philo&s;ophy for&s;akes me.
I have borne up under my own &s;orrows&mdash;his
quite &s;ubdue me&mdash;I mu&s;t lay by my pen
&mdash;my eyes are brim full of tears &hellip;&hellip;
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. Ah, my dear, what
will become of us? I am almo&s;t dead with
apprehen&s;ion. Ra&s;h, ra&s;h, unhappy Mr.
Faulkland! He has fled from the hou&s;e
where my brother had concealed him: I
know not what I am writing, my fears di&s;|tract
me. 'Tis but two hours &s;ince we left
him, Sir George relying on his promi&s;e, and
unwilling to provoke him by any appearance
of con&s;traint, gave no caution to the gentle|man
with whom he was lodged to ob&s;erve
his motions; he is ready to kill him&s;elf for
this neglect; but relying on Mr. Faulkland's
promi&s;e not to make any attempt on his
life, he &s;u&s;pected not that he would endea|vour
to e&s;cape. E&s;cape do I call it? rather
let me &s;ay, to throw him&s;elf into certain
de&s;truction.&mdash;He is &s;et out on his way for
Ireland. Heaven knows what will be the
con&s;equence of this, if my brother does not
overtake and per&s;uade him back. He is
<PB N="369" REF="370">
gone after him, my cou&s;in Warner with him;
both rode po&s;t.</P>
<P>My thoughts are &s;o confu&s;ed, I can put
nothing in order. It &s;eems we had not long
quitted him, when he called up his &s;ervant,
(that groom who, as I informed you, had
come over with him) and telling him he was
going out of town, ordered him to go directly
to an inn &s;omewhere in the city, and hire
two po&s;t-hor&s;es, and that he would follow
him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The man obeyed, and in about half an
hour, his ma&s;ter came in a hackney-coach to
the place where he had directed him to wait
for him.</P>
<P>Upon the inn-keeper's enquiring whither
the hor&s;es were to go, Mr. Faulkland re|plied,
to St. Albans. The man objected
to the length of the &s;tage, and named Bar|net.
Mr. Faulkland &s;eemed impatient and
angry; his unu&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s, his wild
looks, and the road he purpo&s;ed taking,
alarmed his &s;ervant (a di&s;creet elderly man)
and he had the prudence immediately to di&s;|patch
the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, whom he
prevailed on by a piece of money, to go di|rectly
to my brother with this intelligence.</P>
<P>He had the precaution not to mention
his ma&s;ter's name, only bad him find out
Sir George Bidulph, and tell him that his
friend was &s;et out for St. Albans, and that
his man had di&s;patched him with the news,
<PB N="370" REF="371">
and would, if po&s;&s;ible, endeavour to detain
him on the road, that Sir George might
overtake him.</P>
<P>The man was punctual in delivering his
me&s;&s;age. My brother, wild with amaze|ment
and horror, ju&s;t called as he pa&s;t my
door, to tell me this new and unexpected
misfortune. Mr. Warner had that in&s;tant
come to enquire what had pa&s;t between Mr.
Faulkland and me in our interview this
morning. I had no time to tell him any|thing.
He looked very much di&s;plea&s;ed at
my brother and me, upon hearing Mr. Faulk|land
was gone; but &s;aid he would accom|pany
Sir George, and they both hurried
away together.</P>
<P>The man &s;aid, Mr. Faulkland had &s;et off
before he could leave his hou&s;e, the &s;ervant
having &s;carce time to give him the me&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>I fear it will be impo&s;&s;ible for my brother
to overtake him&mdash;He will be lo&s;t forever&mdash;
what then will be my portion? Happy had
it been for me indeed, as my dear mother
once &s;aid, in the bitterne&s;s of her heart, that
I had died in my cradle!</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Tue&s;day night twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>Heaven be prai&s;ed, they are returned!
<HI>All</HI> returned; Mr. Faulkland has been pre|vailed
on to come back, Mr. Warner has
prevailed on him. He hag &s;aved his life;
but, my Cecilia, thy friend's temporal hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="371" REF="372">
and peace of mind, is the only price
that could ran&s;om this de&s;perate &s;elf-devoted
victim!</P>
<P>Mr. Warner has bound him&s;elf by a &s;o|lemn
oath that I &s;hould become his wife,
or Mr. Faulkland, determined on his own
de&s;truction, would, &s;pite of all they could
do, have pur&s;ued his fatal journey to Ire|land,
in order to deliver him&s;elf up to
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It was near ten o'clock before they re|turned
to town. My brother carried Mr.
Faulkland back to the gentleman's hou&s;e,
where he was before lodged; and my kin&s;|man
left them together, in order to come and
give me an account of what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He &s;aid the gentleman, at who&s;e hou&s;e
he was lodged by my brother, was extreme|ly
&s;urprized at &s;eeing him again, Mr.
Faulkland having with great compo&s;ure ta|ken
his leave of him in the morning; and
after thanking him for the &s;helter he had
afforded him, told him he was going out of
town.</P>
<P>My brother and my kin&s;man overtook
him about a mile on this &s;ide St. Alban's,
for which &s;ucce&s;s they were intirely indebt|ed
to the prudence of the &s;ervant who at|tended
him: for the poor man, finding
him pu&s;hing on with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s,
and Mr. Faulkland no longer making a &s;e|cret
of his intention of returning to Ireland,
<PB N="372" REF="373">
re&s;olved at all events to prevent his ruin; and
hoping that by a little delay, Sir George might
overtake them, contrived at their fir&s;t &s;tage,
&s;o dexterou&s;ly to &s;lip a nail in between the
hor&s;e's &s;hoe and his hoof, that he knew he
could not go far without being lame.</P>
<P>This &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the poor animal
was &s;oon di&s;abled, and Mr. Faulkland not
having it in his power to mount him&s;elf better,
was obliged to go on at a very ea&s;y rate, 'till
they arrived at the next &s;tage.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner and my brother overtook him
in this &s;ituation: Sir George knew him as &s;oon
as they came in &s;ight of him, and followed
him at a proper di&s;tance, &s;till keeping him
in view, 'till he alighted at the po&s;t-hou&s;e.
They then at once entered the room, into
which he had retired, whil&s;t fre&s;h hor&s;es were
getting ready.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;tarted at the &s;ight of my
brother; he looked earne&s;tly at Mr. Warner,
whom he had never &s;een before; but &s;poke
not to either of them.</P>
<P>Sir George, pur&s;ued my kin&s;man, acco&s;ted
him affectionately: Dear Faulkland, was this
kind of you, thus to fly from your friends
that love you? He pre&s;ented me to him at the
&s;ame time, naming me as his relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland gra&s;ped the hand, which I
reached out in &s;alutation to him; he fixed
his fine &s;parkling eyes on my face: Is it
Mr. Warner whom I have the honour to
<PB N="373" REF="374">
&s;alute? Sir, I am no &s;tranger to your worth:
I honour, I revere you. You are too good
to intere&s;t your&s;elf thus for an unhappy
wretch, ca&s;t off, and for&s;aken by all the
world.</P>
<P>Do I for&s;ake you, Faulkland, cried your
brother, kindly enough? No, Faulkland, I
am your con&s;tant &s;incere friend, and will prove
my&s;elf &s;o, if you will but let me. Mr. Faulk|land
made no reply.</P>
<P>Dear Faulkland, am I not your friend?
You are Mrs. Arnold's brother.&mdash;You are
not the man you were. Indeed, Faulkland,
I am; I am your true friend; &s;uffer me to be
&s;o, come back with me; Mr. Warner and I
have followed you, in the hope of prevailing
on you to return with us; do, Faulkland, let
us per&s;uade you to pre&s;erve a life &s;o dear to
us all.</P>
<P>What am I to live for, an&s;wered Mr.
Faulkland &s;ternly? <HI>You</HI> have tried to deceive
me; the man I loved mo&s;t, now I am fallen,
rejects me. Your &s;i&s;ter per&s;i&s;ts in her ob&s;ti|nate
cruelty towards me; &s;he breaks her pro|mi&s;e,
and you encourage her in it. I have
neither friends, fortune, or country! and do
you talk to me of life on <HI>&s;uch</HI> conditions?
No, Bidulph, it is a burden, of which I
will rid my&s;elf.&mdash;Mr. Warner, <HI>you</HI> are a
generous man, <HI>you</HI> have an enlarged mind;
may a &s;tranger a&s;k a favour of you?</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375">
I could have wept, continued my kin&s;man,
to &s;ee &s;uch a frank noble fellow driven to

there is nothing I would not do to &s;erve

<P>I thank you, Sir; I have a little &s;on; let

his que&s;tion, Will you, Mr. Warner? <HI>You</HI>
have an enlarged mind, and do not de&s;pi&s;e
the unfortunate.</P>
<P>I cried down right; he touched me to the
very quick. I never was &s;o affected in my
life; and I own I was heartily di&s;plea&s;ed both
with you and your brother, for driving him
to &s;uch extremities: <HI>You</HI> e&s;pecially, on whom
I laid injunctions to act in a contrary way.
As for Sir George, I am not &s;urprized at <HI>his</HI>
behaviour.</P>
<P>From Mr. Faulkland's di&s;cour&s;e, proceeded
my kin&s;man, it was apparent to me, that his
di&s;traction proceeded from no other cau&s;e,
than his belief that you and your brother
&s;lighted him in his misfortunes. It was plain
when he fled to England, that he was &s;uffici|ently
in his &s;en&s;es to be anxious for his own
&s;afety; and though the &s;ight of you, joined
to the hurry of his &s;pirits, his fatigue, and
want of &s;leep, might, in a man of &s;uch violent
pa&s;&s;ions, have created a temporary phrenzy,
<PB N="375" REF="376">
yet I am very certain it would all have &s;ub&s;id|ed,
if you had behaved to him as you ought
to have done, and as I de&s;ired you would:
nor do I &s;ee how you can an&s;wer it to your|&s;elf,
after the mi&s;eries you have already
brought on &s;uch a glorious man (for I never
&s;aw his equal either in mind or per&s;on) to per|&s;i&s;t
in a behaviour which has already turned
his brain, and mu&s;t in the end occa&s;ion his
death: for death he is determined on, if you
refu&s;e to become his wife.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, cried I, leave him not to him&s;elf,
I conjure you; you &s;ee the influence you have
over his mind; you have done wonders in
bringing him back.&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, replied Mr. Warner, till I inform you
of the means I was obliged to u&s;e.</P>
<P>I have told you how I was affected with
his &s;ituation, and the reque&s;t he made me to
take care of his child. This was not the &s;ug|ge&s;tion
of madne&s;s; it was plain to me, that
if the cau&s;e were removed, he would &s;oon be
re&s;tored to the perfect u&s;e of his rea&s;on, and
I could not bear to &s;ee the de&s;olation of &s;uch
a noble frame, and all charged to your ac|count.</P>
<P>Sir, I hope you do not mean, &s;aid I, to
return to Ireland, do you not know the ri&s;que
that you run by putting your&s;elf into the
power of an exa&s;perated family, from whom
you can expect nothing but the mo&s;t malevo|lent
per&s;ecution?</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="377">
I deliver my&s;elf up to the laws, replied Mr.
Faulkland; my life is devoted, 'tis indifferent
to me how I die.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, &s;aid I, Mrs. Arnold &s;hould con&s;ent
to marry you, would not that reconcile you to
life?</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, and he &s;hook his head, I am not
to be deceived <HI>twice.</HI> (Your brother walked
about the room without taking part in the
conver&s;ation.)</P>
<P>I do not mean it, Sir, Mrs. Arnold mu&s;t
be yours; <HI>I</HI> can influence her; do but return
back with me, I give you my honour I will
do my utmo&s;t to prevail on her to give you
her hand immediately. Her heart is har|dened,
Sir, &s;he will not con&s;ent, replied he.
I have no friend to urge her, I am an out|ca&s;t;
and not fit to live&mdash;<HI>I</HI> will urge her, Sir,
&s;he re&s;pects me, &s;he will be guided by me;
&s;he &s;hall fulfil the promi&s;e &s;he made you&mdash;
Oh, Sir, you but deceive your&s;elf&mdash;&s;he will
find out new excu&s;es, I am not to be again
allured by fal&s;e hopes.</P>
<P>He &s;tepped towards the door as he &s;poke
the&s;e words, and was about to open it. Your
brother followed, and laid hold of his arm;
I did the &s;ame. Sir George, &s;aid he, expo&s;e
me not to in&s;ults, why do you per&s;ecute me?
leave me, Sir, I am <HI>not</HI> a madman&mdash;but I
am <HI>determined</HI>&mdash;and he &s;poke it as if he were
<HI>indeed</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>For heaven's &s;ake, Faulkland, &s;aid your
<PB N="377" REF="378">
brother, be compo&s;ed: you have Mr. War|ner's
word of honour; you &s;hall have mine
too, that we will do our utmo&s;t to per&s;uade
Mrs. Arnold to con&s;ent to your wi&s;hes.
You have <HI>my</HI> full con&s;ent, you have won
Mr. Warner to your intere&s;t, my &s;i&s;ter will
yield to our joint entreaties. <HI>Yield,</HI> he
repeated, no, no, Sir George, &s;he has a
&s;tubborn heart. I once thought it other|wi&s;e;
but it is turned to &s;tone, nothing but
my death will &s;atisfy her, and &s;he <HI>&s;hall</HI> be &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>He made an effort to break from us. Stay
Mr. Faulkland, &s;aid I, again laying hold of
his hand, and I here &s;wear to you by every
thing that is &s;acred, that if you will &s;uffer
me to conduct you back into Mrs. Arnold's
pre&s;ence, I will in&s;i&s;t on her immediately
accepting of you for her hu&s;band, or I will
for ever renounce all friend&s;hip with her:
I know &s;he e&s;teems and values you above
all men, I am therefore &s;ure, I do no vio|lence
to her inclinations; and if &s;he per&s;e|veres
in her ob&s;tinate punctilios, I &s;wear to
you by the &s;ame oath, that I will no longer
oppo&s;e you in your re&s;olutions, let them be
what they will.</P>
<P>Sir George, added I, Do you join with
me in giving your friend the &s;ame a&s;|&s;urances?
I do, an&s;wered he, &s;olemnly ad|dre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to Mr. Faulkland, and
&s;wear by all my hopes of happine&s;s here|after,
<PB N="378" REF="379">
to act in conjunction with Mr. War|ner
in every particular that he has promi&s;|ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;eemed to be moved, he
looked wi&s;tfully at us by turns, as if wil|ling,
though afraid, to yield to our intrea|ties.</P>
<P>At length, I <HI>think</HI> I may rely on you, &s;aid
he, you will not break an oath (to Sir George)
but that woman has &s;uch an <HI>inflexible</HI> heart!
you cannot change <HI>that.</HI></P>
<P>We will do our utmo&s;t, we both an&s;wered
together. Remember then, &s;aid he, &s;tretch|ing
out a hand to each of us, you have &s;worn,
if &s;he per&s;i&s;ts in her re&s;olution, that you will
leave me to my&s;elf, and oppo&s;e me no longer.
We have. I will go back with you then,
cried Mr. Faulkland, and &s;tepped again nim|bly
to the door.</P>
<P>It will be be&s;t, &s;aid I, if we can hire a
coach to carry us; there is no nece&s;&s;ity for
our riding po&s;t, and we &s;hall be le&s;s liable
to ob&s;ervation than if we were on hor&s;e|back.
Mr. Faulkland looked as if he &s;u&s;|pected
&s;ome de&s;ign; do you not mean, &s;aid
he, to go directly back to London? Cer|tainly,
I replied. And &s;hall I &s;ee Mrs. Arnold
to-night? Without doubt, if you de&s;ire it.
Let us go then, &s;aid he; I think a coach is
a tedious way of travelling, but I &s;ubmit to
<HI>your</HI> guidance.</P>
<P>I left Sir George with him, and went out
<PB N="379" REF="380">
to enquire whether we could be provided
with a coach and four; which after &s;ome de|lay
was procured for us. We prevailed on
Mr. Faulkland, whil&s;t it was getting ready,
to take a little refre&s;hment. He a&s;ked us,
by what means we were informed of his de|parture.</P>
<P>Sir George, unwilling to let him know
that his &s;ervant had di&s;covered it, evaded the
que&s;tion; and only replied, Do you think,
Faulkland, that in the humour I left you, I
could be inattentive to your motions? I am
not a madman, Bidulph, I mu&s;t not be treated
like one. I do not think you one, an&s;wered
your brother, but I know you are warm, and
too fearle&s;s of danger.</P>
<P>When the coach was ready, Mr. Faulkland
very willingly got into it with us. He &s;poke
but little, and appeared very thoughtful during
our journey.</P>
<P>The coachman &s;topped at an inn, after we
had driven about fifteen miles, to bate his
hor&s;es for a while. He &s;eemed &s;tartled at it,
and &s;aid he would not alight. We told him
there was no occa&s;ion, but your brother and
I cho&s;e to go into the hou&s;e, that he might
not think we watched him He &s;eemed plea&s;|ed
at this, and &s;miled when we &s;et forward
again, but did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>When we arrived in London, Now, Sir,
&s;aid I, we will, if you plea&s;e, go directly to
Mrs. Arnold's hou&s;e. As I am &s;ure your
<PB N="380" REF="381">
ab&s;enting your&s;elf in the manner you did,
exceedingly afflicted her, &s;o am I certain your
return will give her &s;incere joy. I am ready
therefore to attend you immediately to her;
but if I may advi&s;e you, I think it were
better that I &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee and talk to her.
It will be proper to prepare her, by giving
her at lea&s;t one night to reflect on the im|portant
event, which I expect will take place
to-morrow. Sir George, what are your &s;en|timents?
I am of your own mind, replied
your brother; I think my &s;i&s;ter ought by all
means to have &s;o much time given her for
recollection. If Faulkland has no objection
to it, we will go to my friend's hou&s;e, where
he was before. When you have &s;een my
&s;i&s;ter, you may come to us there with her de|termination.</P>
<P>I have &s;ubmitted my&s;elf for the pre&s;ent,
an&s;wered Mr. Faulkland, to your guidance.
To-morrow remember I am to be at liberty.
Bidulph, beware how you watch my motions
again.</P>
<P>Your brother then directed the coachman
to his friend's hou&s;e, Mr. Faulkland not op|po&s;ing
the motion. I went in for a few mi|nutes
merely to &s;atisfy my&s;elf in what manner
Mr. Faulkland had e&s;caped from thence in
order to inform you.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was very urgent with me to
go to you. Keep me not long in &s;u&s;pence,
<PB N="381" REF="382">
Sir, &s;aid he, I may as well know my fate to|night,
as to-morrow.</P>
<P>I left him with a promi&s;e to return with
your final an&s;wer. You know <HI>my</HI> &s;entiments,
you know your brother's, and it re&s;ts on you
to pronounce &s;entence of life or death (for
your an&s;wer imports no le&s;s) on a man who is
worthy of the greate&s;t queen in the univer&s;e.
What do you &s;ay, Mrs. Arnold, mu&s;t Faulk|land
die?</P>
<P>Heaven forbid, cried I, no, Sir; I &s;hould be
inflexible <HI>indeed,</HI> if after what yon have told
me, I were any longer to re&s;i&s;t. I yield, Sir,
to your reque&s;t, to Mr. Falkland's, and to
my brother's; and I will own at the &s;ame time
that my heart &s;trongly impels me to con&s;ent.
Yet, my dear Sir, believe me I &s;hould have
re&s;i&s;ted <HI>that</HI> impul&s;e, if I could hope that my
refu&s;al would not be followed by con&s;equences
too dreadful to be thought on. There is
therefore <HI>no</HI> alternative, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the wife of
Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>The &s;ooner the affair is fini&s;hed then the
better, &s;aid he; Faulkland &s;tands here on &s;lip|pery
ground; perhaps &s;ome of the Bond family
may by this time be arrived in England, and
in pur&s;uit of him; therefore let your marriage
be di&s;patched immediately, and &s;end him away
directly to Holland. I &s;uppo&s;e when he has
made &s;ure of you, he may be prevailed on to
go without you. Oh, Sir, &s;aid I, urge this
reque&s;t to him I be&s;eech you, it is of the la&s;t
<PB N="382" REF="383">
importance to me that he &s;hould comply with
it, and the only preliminary that I have now
to make to our marriage. Yes, yes, an&s;wered
my kin&s;man, I think we &s;hall convince him
of the nece&s;&s;ity of this. I &s;hall e&s;cort you
to Holland my&s;elf, for I have bu&s;ine&s;s at
Rotterdam; and I had thoughts of taking
the voyage if this occa&s;ion had not offered.
We will but ju&s;t &s;tay to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs
here, and ob&s;erve what mea&s;ures can be
taken for his &s;ervice, and then follow him.
Take courage, my dear, continued he, &s;ee|ing
me look &s;ad, all may come right again.
I love out-of-the-way adventures, and this
I think <HI>is</HI> one. We will live like princes let
us go where we will. I only wi&s;h that your
brother were <HI>again&s;t</HI> the match, that I might
have the more plea&s;ure in forwarding it;
but I need not grudge him that <HI>once</HI> in
his life he has &s;hewn &s;ome token of genero|&s;ity.</P>
<P>I will return to Faulkland, I long to &s;et
his noble heart at ea&s;e. Strange perver&s;e
creatures your &s;ex are! it amazes me that
any thing could tempt you to reject &s;uch a
man! were I a woman, I &s;hould run mad
for him. Well, I will go to him, and let
him know without any farther demurs, you
will give him your hand to-morrow morn|ing.
Our hone&s;t friend Price I think may
join you. I will call on him, after I have
&s;een Faulkland, to bid him prepare for the
<PB N="383" REF="384">
bu&s;ine&s;s. I will my&s;elf have the plea&s;ure of
giving you away. Good by&mdash;and away he
went with a plea&s;ed bu&s;y countenance.</P>
<P>I took up my pen as &s;oon as he departed,
and have &s;cribbled thus far without &s;uffering
any reflections to &s;top me. Let me now lay
down my pen, to pau&s;e before I leap into
the frightful precipice that opens before
me &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
&hellip;&hellip; To-morrow! Ah, my Cecilia,
what is that morrow to produce? it joins
me for ever to Mr. Faulkland! the cho&s;en
of my heart, my fir&s;t love! the man who
adores me; who de&s;erves all my affection,
who has obliged me beyond all recompence.
Who has a claim to my warme&s;t gratitude,
to my e&s;teem, to my whole heart. I &s;ave
his life, I have the power to make him hap|py;
my brother, my kin&s;man urge me;
my own heart too prompts me. Why can
not I then reconcile my&s;elf to my lot? Oh
that que&s;tion is an&s;wered by a fearful image
that &s;tarts up to my fancy&mdash;I am not &s;uper|&s;titious,
yet believe me, my dear, I am at
this in&s;tant chilled with horror.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s my weakne&s;s,
but I mu&s;t call Patty to &s;it with me the re|mainder
of the night. I cannot think of re&s;t!</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day Morning.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed the whole night in endea|vouring
to fortify my mind again&s;t the im|portant
<PB N="384" REF="385">
event that a few hours will accom|pli&s;h.
If Mr. Faulkland's mind &s;hould again
become tranquil, which my kin&s;man gave
me room to hope would be the con&s;equence
of gratifying the ardent wi&s;h of his &s;oul, I
mu&s;t take care not to di&s;turb it, by &s;hewing
any reluctance in yielding him my hand.
Had an Angel <HI>once</HI> told me that I &s;hould
give my hand <HI>reluctantly</HI> to Mr. Faulkland,
I would not have believed it; yet fatally cir|cum&s;tanced
as our marriage <HI>now</HI> is, it can|not
be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet I <HI>ought</HI> to be his. I owe him a
great &s;acrifice, and I am about to pay it.
I am dre&s;&s;ed and ready. I wait for my
kin&s;man, or my brother, one of whom, or
both perhaps, will be here pre&s;ently &hellip;.
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Mr. Warner is come;
I have but ju&s;t time to tell you that my bro|ther
and Mr. Price are with Mr. Faulkland,
My kin&s;man &s;ays, he is quite a new man.
They wait for me, I go. Heaven guide my
&s;teps &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day.</HI>&mdash;My fate is accompli&s;hed! What
a change! Join with me, my dear Cecilia,
in be&s;eeching heaven to look graciou&s;ly down
on me in my new &s;tate, and to guide and
protect my beloved Mr. Faulkland, my ever
de&s;tined hu&s;band. Alas! my dear, he is
now many miles &s;eparated from me.</P>
<P>The worthy Mr. Price performed the &s;a|cred
ceremony. Mr. Warner did the office
<PB N="385" REF="386">
of a father. He and my brother were all
who were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o amazing in all
this, I can &s;carce credit my &s;en&s;es; but my
life has been a &s;eries of &s;trange, &s;trange
events!</P>
<P>I am &s;o bewildered, I cannot connect my
thoughts; but I will try to give you my
ye&s;terday's <HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> for I can hardly per&s;uade
my&s;elf that what I recollect really happened.</P>
<P>I broke off ju&s;t as Mr. Warner called on
me, to carry me to the hou&s;e of my brother's
friend.</P>
<P>While we were in the coach, he told me,
that having the night before informed Mr.
Faulkland of the joyful news of my con&s;ent|ing
to marry him the next day, he &s;eemed
at fir&s;t to doubt, and repeatedly conjured
him not to deceive him; 'till having received
the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of its being true,
Mr. Faulkland gave him&s;elf up to &s;uch ex|tacies,
as made them apprehen&s;ive his joy
might have effects almo&s;t as fatal in their
con&s;equences, as his de&s;pair was likely to
produce before.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner had a mind to lower him a lit|tle,
and thought, by putting him in mind of
his danger, &s;omewhat to allay his tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold's con&s;ent to make you happy,
&s;aid he, fills me with extreme joy; but it is
not now a time, to indulge it: you are here
in peril of your life; you mu&s;t pre&s;erve it
<PB N="386" REF="387">
now for Mrs. Arnold's &s;ake. For Mrs. Ar|nold's
&s;ake! he replied with ec&s;ta&s;y, yes,
yes, 'tis now worth pre&s;erving. Mr. War|ner,
Kin&s;man, Friend of my life, (gra&s;ping
his hand) di&s;po&s;e of me as you plea&s;e; you
&s;hall guide all my &s;teps. Will not Mrs.
Arnold go with me after we are made one?</P>
<P>If, after having con&s;idered what may be
urged to you on that head, you &s;hould &s;till
continue to de&s;ire it, replied my cou&s;in, &s;he
will without doubt accompany you. But,
my dear Sir, con&s;ider, circum&s;tanced as you
now are, what will the world &s;ay, &s;hould
&s;he accompany your flight? It will fix an
indelible &s;tain on her character, which is
dearer to her than life, and which I am &s;ure,
upon cooler thoughts, you will prize at an
equal value. This marriage will be a pro|found
&s;ecret to the world; it may remain &s;o
as long as we plea&s;e. I have bu&s;ine&s;s in
Holland, which will demand my pre&s;ence
there in a very &s;hort time. Her accompany|ing
me thither can give ri&s;e to no &s;u&s;picion.
I will di&s;patch my affairs with all po&s;&s;ible
&s;peed, and conduct her to you.</P>
<P>The joy that before lighted up his counte|nance,
pur&s;ued my cou&s;in, &s;eemed a little
clouded. He took a turn or two about the
room, as if to con&s;ider of what I had &s;aid;
then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf jointly to your bro|ther
and me. You are both cooler than I am;
perhaps you may judge better; let me but
<PB N="387" REF="388">
call her <HI>mine,</HI> I will then do as you would
have me. I cannot determine on any thing
now.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my &s;i&s;ter and you are married,
&s;aid Sir George, I think, Faulkland, you
ought to get out of England with all the
&s;peed you can. It will be but a &s;hort ab|&s;ence;
Sidney will &s;oon follow you. What
do you purpo&s;e doing in regard to your &s;on?
I had forgot him, cried Mr. Faulkland.
Poor child! My heart has been in &s;uch tu|mults
&s;ince Mr. Warner came in, that I
could think of nothing but the ble&s;&s;ed news
he has brought me. But I mu&s;t not neglect my
boy. I will write to the hone&s;t &s;ervant that
I left behind; he &s;hall bring him over: You,
my dear Bidulph, will take care of him, 'till
an opportunity offers of &s;ending him to me.</P>
<P>I hope there will be no need, replied your
brother, of &s;ending him out of England;
your affairs may yet turn out &s;o as to permit
your return into your own country.&mdash;Im|po&s;&s;ible!
interrupted Mr. Faulkland: if
Smyth &s;hould even recover, <HI>his</HI> repre&s;entation
of the other accident cuts off every hope.
He will not, for his own &s;ake, confe&s;s the
truth, but impute the error of my fatal hand
to premeditated guilt. Heaven knows,
ba&s;e as &s;he was, I would not have attempted
her life; but I was born to be the avenger of
tho&s;e crimes, into the commi&s;&s;ion of which I,
perhaps, fir&s;t led her. As for the contempti|ble
<PB N="388" REF="389">
villain who wronged me, I do not repent
of the puni&s;hment I inflicted on him; though
probably, had I been allowed a moment's
time for recollection, I might have taken
vengeance in a manner more worthy of
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was delighted, proceeded Mr. Warner,
to find him &s;o cool and rational in his reflexi|ons.
He continued talking calmly and rea&s;on|ably
on the &s;ubject of his misfortunes; but on
the mention of your name, &s;tarted again into
tran&s;ports; but they now &s;eemed to be only
tho&s;e of joy, upon the pro&s;pect of what was
to happen the next day.</P>
<P>After I left him, I went to Mr. Price, who
promi&s;ed to be in readine&s;s at the appointed
hour.</P>
<P>We were now got to the hou&s;e of my bro|ther's
friend. Mr Warner led me up &s;tairs
into the room, where Sir George, Mr. Faulk|land,
and Mr. Price, were &s;itting together.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland was &s;o agitated at the &s;ight
of me, that having ri&s;en to &s;alute me, he
was not able to &s;peak; but &s;eizing both my
hands, he ki&s;&s;ed them fervently one after the
other, tears dropping on them as he held
them to his lips. Every one was &s;ilent; we
were all too much affected to &s;peak. My
brother was the fir&s;t that broke &s;ilence. Well,
Faulkland, &s;aid he, have we not kept our
promi&s;e?</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland turned towards him: Oh,
<PB N="389" REF="390">
Bidulph, forgive me for doubting; I am
afraid I have u&s;ed you ill: Can you pardon
the madne&s;s that I was driven to by de&s;pair?
&mdash;Mr. Warner, Mrs. Arnold, I believe you
think me di&s;tracted. Indeed I am not. I
was only&mdash;(and he &s;eemed to he&s;itate for a
word) weary of life.&mdash;I thought I had lo&s;t
every thing.&mdash;The world was grown a de|&s;art.
&mdash;No one in it for me.</P>
<P>You formed a wrong judgment, my dear
Sir, an&s;wered Mr. Warner; you find your|&s;elf
now with your &s;incere friends; Sir George
and my&s;elf are both &s;o; and your bride,
your dear Mrs. Arnold, is ready to give you
her hand. I <HI>am,</HI> Sir, &s;aid I, and if your
happine&s;s &s;till depends on me, it gives me
joy that I have at length the power of <HI>be|&s;towing</HI>
it.</P>
<P>I have no <HI>words,</HI> he replied, I can <HI>find</HI> none,
it is all <HI>here;</HI> and he laid his hand on his
heart, his eyes fixed with delight on my face.</P>
<P>I beheld him now, my Cecilia, in a light
in which I had never before viewed him;
overwhelmed by misfortunes, of which I ac|cu&s;ed
my&s;elf as being the author. I &s;aw him
an exile, likely to be deprived of a noble
fortune, his heart pierced with remor&s;e for an
involuntary crime, I &s;aw too that he loved me;
loved me with a &s;ervent and unconquerable
pa&s;&s;ion. Of this, in the angui&s;h of his &s;oul,
at a time when he was wrought up to phrenzy,
he had given but too &s;trong demon&s;tration.
<PB N="390" REF="391">
Shall I own it to you, my Cecilia, I think I
never loved him as I did in that moment.</P>
<P>My heart was at once a&s;&s;ailed by a variety
of pa&s;&s;ions; among&s;t which, gratitude, and
the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, were predominant.</P>
<P>I continued &s;ilent, whil&s;t Mr. Faulkland
remained ardently gazing at me.</P>
<P>My brother, I believe, thought us too &s;o|lemn;
the occa&s;ion indeed required it: but
his fears for Mr. Faulkland made him wi&s;h
to give the &s;cene a livelier turn.</P>
<P>Come &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, let us not defer the
happy event for which we are now met, we
have no time to wa&s;te in ceremony. You
remember what our mother u&s;ed to &s;ay,
&startq;Many things fall out between the cup and
the lip.&endq; My brother ro&s;e off his chair as
he &s;aid this. Mr. Warner taking the hint,
approached, and took me by the hand. Let
<HI>me,</HI> &s;aid he, to Mr. Faulkland, have the hap|pine&s;s
of be&s;towing this be&s;t of Creatures on
the man that I think <HI>be&s;t</HI> de&s;erves her.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland made no reply; but in tak|ing
the hand that my kin&s;man put into his,
his looks &s;poke the rapture that &s;welled his
heart; though I &s;aw he put a con&s;traint upon
him&s;elf, and endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a deport|ment
&s;uitable to the important and &s;olemn
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After the indi&s;&s;oluble knot was tied, my
brother de&s;ired Mr. Faulkland to retire with
him into the next room for a few minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="392">
I concluded it was in order to pre&s;s his de|parture,
and to prevail on him to &s;ubmit to
going without me</P>
<P>This I found afterwards was the &s;ubject of
their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>They returned to us in about a quarter of
an hour, Mr. Faulkland's countenance le&s;s
embarra&s;&s;ed than it was at going out of the
room. On their entering, Mr. Price took his
leave. My brother addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Warner
and me. Faulkland, &s;aid he, is convinced
of the nece&s;&s;ity there is for his immediately
withdrawing from England, and he is de|termined
to depart from hence at three
o'clock to morrow morning; for I would by
no means have him leave London by day-light,
as we know not who may be on the
watch to trace his &s;teps. He has con&s;ented
that you, &s;i&s;ter, &s;hould remain behind till
Mr. Warner's affairs will permit him to
conduct you over. In the mean time ma&s;ter
Faulkland is to be brought from Ireland;
and if you &s;hould not be ready to depart be|fore
his arrival, you may take him over with
you to Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland &s;eemed rather to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> my
brother to make this explanation for him,
than to a&s;&s;ent chearfully to it. Mr. War|ner
and I however, laid hold of it, and im|mediately
entered into di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ub|ject
of our dome&s;tic concerns, and the mea|&s;ures
<PB N="392" REF="393">
proper to be ob&s;erved on &s;o critical an
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland joined in the conver&s;ation
with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure; and to my un|&s;peakable
joy &s;eemed perfectly &s;ettled and
collected in his mind. I thought indeed he
appeared a little con&s;trained, and that he
&s;eemed to keep a con&s;tant guard over him|&s;elf,
left he &s;hould betray any &s;ymptom of a
too much heated imagination: but my kin&s;|man
afterwards ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure to
me, that this denoted nothing more than a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in Mr. Faulkland of the un|happy
wandering that had before &s;o much
alarmed us all; and into which he was &s;ure
there was not the lea&s;t danger of his relap&s;ing,
as his heart was now perfectly at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland told us he had letters to
write to Ireland, which he would di&s;patch,
that he might have nothing to interrupt the
few &s;hort hours we had to pa&s;s together in
the evening.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner &s;aid he had bu&s;ine&s;s to do
that called him away, but that he would re|turn
after dinner: and my brother (that
Mr. Faulkland might be quite undi&s;turbed)
propo&s;ed my going home with him, and that
we &s;hould come back together in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland did not object to this, and
I went with Sir George.</P>
<P>We returned early in the afternoon to
Mr. Faulkland. As my brother had let his
<PB N="393" REF="394">
friend into our &s;ecret, we pa&s;&s;ed up &s;tairs
without any notice being taken of us.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkland had writ two letters; one
of them very long, to Mr. Bond, which he
gave my brother to read, but I know not the
contents of it. The other was to that careful
hone&s;t &s;ervant whom he had mentioned to us,
with orders to bring over Ma&s;ter Faulkland
with all convenient &s;peed, and put him into
Sir George's hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner but ju&s;t called in upon us in
the evening, he &s;aid he had been making the
nece&s;&s;ary preparations for Mr. Faulkland's
journey; and that having re&s;olved him&s;elf
to attend him as far as Harwich, he would,
at the hour appointed, call on him in a coach,
which &s;hould carry them a few miles out of
town, where the hor&s;es were to wait for
them.</P>
<P>Worthy, compa&s;&s;ionate, and generous kin&s;|man,
how I love you for the hone&s;t warmth
of your heart!</P>
<P>My brother and Mr. Faulkland had a great
deal of di&s;cour&s;e about the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures
that were to be taken by us all; and we
pa&s;&s;ed the evening in a kind of cha&s;tened
&s;atisfaction, which could not ari&s;e to happi|ne&s;s
from the near pro&s;pect we had of part|ing.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock my brother took an
affectionate leave of his friend, he excu&s;ed
him&s;elf from accompanying him on his
<PB N="394" REF="395">
journey, on account of Lady Sarah's not
being well.</P>
<P>To &s;ee <HI>&s;uch</HI> a parting, would at another
time have deeply affected me, but my own
hour of &s;eparation drew near. It came, and
Mr. Warner, punctual to his time, hurried
Mr. Faulkland almo&s;t by force into the coach,
and drove off with him.</P>
<P>I threw my&s;elf into a chair which he had
ordered for me, and was carried home. I
went not to bed; but had recour&s;e to my
pen. God pre&s;erve my dear fugitive! I can
do nothing but weep.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 2.&mdash;My mind was too much un&s;ettled
ye&s;terday to dictate any thing coherent. I
am now, thank heaven, more compo&s;ed. Sir
George and Lady Sarah have been with me
during the greate&s;t part of the day; both
kind and con&s;oling. My brother &s;eems to
have all his former affection for me revived
in his heart; he is indeed charmed with my
ju&s;tice, as he calls it. Lady Sarah, who at the
bottom of her heart is no way concerned
about this event, affects however to think as
her hu&s;band does, and commends me for my
genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>I feel my&s;elf ea&s;ier in proportion as I think
Mr. Faulkland gets farther out of the reach
of danger. Sir George &s;ays by this time he
may be on his voyage.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly wait till the child arrives,
in order to take him with me. My two little
<PB N="395" REF="396">
girls will be fond of &s;uch a brother, for he
is a charming boy.</P>
<P>My brother flatters me with a po&s;&s;ibility
at lea&s;t of Major Smyth's recovering; and
if &s;o, he &s;ays that Mr. Faulkland may &s;tand
his trial for the other accident, as he is in
hopes Smyth will not per&s;i&s;t in his villainy &s;o
far as to add, perjury to his other crimes.</P>
<P>I have but little expectations of ju&s;tice
from &s;o bad a man, but I would not di&s;|courage
my friends in their endeavours to
comfort me.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 3.&mdash;Mr. Warner is returned from
Harwich, after having &s;een Mr. Faulkland
&s;afe on board the packet, and even under &s;ail
for Holland.</P>
<P>What a benevolent heart has this good
relation of mine! Indeed I dearly love and
re&s;pect him. His return has revived my
&s;pirits, and I begin to lo&s;e my fears. He
brought me a &s;hort letter from Mr. Faulk|land;
&s;hort it is, but his heart &s;peaks in every
&s;yllable of it. I will not give you the con|tents,
my Cecilia, you will think it too ex|travagant,
too romantic, for a hu&s;band to
write &s;o to his wife.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 6.&mdash;I long, yet dread to hear ac|counts
from Ireland. I fear that wretched
Smyth is dead. No mail has arrived from
thence the&s;e eight days. Contrary winds
they tell me detain the packets on the other
&s;ide very often for a fortnight together. If
<PB N="396" REF="397">
that be &s;o, how fortunate was Mr. Faulkland
in &s;eizing on a lucky hour for his departure
from the Iri&s;h &s;hore.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Bond's family, whom he
mu&s;t have rendered very unhappy, particu|larly
the daughter, are all now his implaca|ble
enemies; and are tormenting them&s;elves
in being detained from the pur&s;uit of their
vengeance. But let them come now when
they will, he is far out of the reach of his
foes.</P>
<P>I would it were po&s;&s;ible for my Cecilia to
arrive in England before my departure for
Holland. Indeed, my dear, I &s;hall not be
&s;orry if I am detained from Mr. Faulkland,
till I have the happine&s;s of fir&s;t embracing
you, as our &s;eparation may be afterwards of
a long continuance. I &s;hall wait for the
arrival of Ma&s;ter Faulkland, and who knows
but adver&s;e winds may detain him till your
return. Oh! that I may pa&s;s, though it be
but one day, with the dear companion of my
youth before we are again divided!</P>
<P>I will not &s;end this packet off, till I am
ready to depart from England, as that will be
clo&s;ing an important period of my Life.
What would I give that my deare&s;t friend
would come, and in&s;tead of this tedious nar|rative
which I have written, receive the ac|count
from my own lips! If my wi&s;hes
&s;hould not be granted in this, cannot you
make Holland your way home? Mr. Faulk|land
<PB N="397" REF="398">
purpo&s;es &s;taying at the Hague till I go
to him.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 9.&mdash;Cecilia! have I been a murmurer
at the decrees of providence? have I been
an impious repiner when heaven has poured
down its wrath upon my head? if not, why
am I marked out for divine vengeance? be|fore
I lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es, or my life, for both I
cannot retain, hear the la&s;t act of your friend's
tragic &s;tory.</P>
<P>My brother called on me this day; he
gave me a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland,
which came under a cover to him. Read it,
&s;aid he, it is from Ireland, and may contain
&s;omething material for us to know.</P>
<P>It was from the hone&s;t &s;ervant Mr. Faulk|land
left behind him. See what he &s;ays,
and then tell me if I ought to live any longer.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;Honoured Sir,&endq;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I have the happine&s;s to &s;end you a piece
of good news, which made me wi&s;h for
wings to have flown over to you with it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My lady, heaven be prai&s;ed, is not dead,
nor &s;o much as hurt. I am thankful for
this, Sir, on your account, not her's.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't know what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the people
at Mr. Bond's, to tell me &s;he was dead;
the mi&s;take, to be &s;ure, was occa&s;ioned by
the great confu&s;ion the family were thrown
into, and indeed, from what I my&s;elf &s;aw
I was &s;ure &s;he was actually dead.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Major Smyth lived till the &s;urgeon came;
<PB N="398" REF="399">
but had been &s;peechle&s;s for two or three
hours, and died whil&s;t his wound was pro|bing.</P>
<P>&startq;My lady had only fallen into a fit, and
the major having bled prodigiou&s;ly, &s;he re|ceived
a great deal of his blood upon her
linen, and as he afterwards contrived to
throw him&s;elf on the bed, which was at
&s;ome di&s;tance from the place where &s;he had
fallen, it gave occa&s;ion to Mrs. Bond, (who
was her&s;elf the fir&s;t per&s;on that entered the
room, after the &s;ad accident) on finding
my lady lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s, pale, and bloody
on the floor to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had been
killed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This alarm ran through the family, and
was confirmed to me by every one in it,
as we &s;ervants &s;oon quitted the chamber;
and the major him&s;elf &s;aid, that you di&s;|charged
one of the pi&s;tols at your lady, and
the other at him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I returned to Mr. Bond's in the morning,
after you were gone off, to enquire whether
Major Smyth was alive or not; he was ju&s;t
then dead.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The waiting-maid informed me, that
my lady, to their great &s;urprize, was reco|vered,
having only been in a fainting fit,
which held her above an hour, without her
&s;hewing any &s;igns of life; and that &s;he had
fallen from one to another 'till morning:
and &s;he farther &s;aid, (begging your honour's
<PB N="399" REF="400">
pardon) it would be no great matter if &s;he
had died in one; for &s;he believed it was
for no good &s;he went in the major's room
at that time of the night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;taid about the hou&s;e all the day to pick
up what intelligence I could from the &s;er|vants.
Young Mr. Bond, with two or three
men went to your hou&s;e, and not finding
you there, I &s;uppo&s;e rode in pur&s;uit of you;
but heaven be prai&s;ed, you have e&s;caped
their hands.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The waiting-maid, who is a very civil
young woman, told me in the evening,
that my lady, being come a little to her&s;elf,
(though I believe not in a right mind) was
informed of the major's death; at which
&s;he was &s;o exceedingly terrified, that,
finding her&s;elf ill be&s;ides, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the
whole truth of the matter, and proved,
that the major died with a lie in his mouth:
&s;o that I hope Mr. Bond's family will not
be &s;o &s;piteful as to pro&s;ecute the affair any
farther.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My lady was &s;ent home directly in the
chariot, as they could not bear the &s;ight of
her any longer in the hou&s;e. She takes
on mightily; but we all ble&s;s our&s;elves,
that &s;he is alive.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall make bold to inclo&s;e this, accord|ing
to your order, to Sir George Bidulph;
and as &s;oon as I receive your commands

</LETTER>
<P>Adieu, my Cecilia, adieu; nothing but
my death &s;hould clo&s;e &s;uch a &s;cene as this.</P>
<P>Here to the editor's great di&s;appointment,
Mrs. Arnold's intere&s;ting &s;tory broke off;
that unhappy lady not having continued her
journal any farther.</P>
<P>But as this &s;eemed to be one of the mo&s;t
affecting periods of her life, his curio&s;ity in|duced
him to enquire of the gentleman from
whom he received tho&s;e papers, whether
he could give him any farther light into her
&s;tory; as he thought it not improbable that
he might have learned, from his mother,
&s;ome other particulars relating to her.</P>
<P>His friend told him that he knew his mo|ther
had drawn up a narrative of the &s;ub&s;e|quent
remarkable events in the life of Mrs.
Arnold, at the reque&s;t of a particular friend;
that he had once heard it read; but, as he
was then a boy, it made but little impre&s;&s;ion
upon him; that afterwards, when he wanted
to have his curio&s;ity gratified, his mother
told him, &s;he could not find the manu&s;cript,
and feared it was lo&s;t. However, he &s;aid,
<PB N="401" REF="402">
he would &s;earch her papers, and, if he re|covered
it, it &s;hould be at his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the gentleman informed
the editor, that he had made the &s;tricte&s;t
&s;crutiny into his mother's papers, and could
find nothiny relative to the &s;ubject of Mrs.
Arnold, excepting a few loo&s;e &s;heets, which
&s;eemed to have been the foul copy of the be|ginning
of her narrative; and, at the &s;ame
time, put them into his hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e the editor offers to the public, as
he received them, without any alteration or
addition.</P>

<HEAD>CECILIA's NARRATIVE, &amp;c.
BEING
A SUPPLEMENT to Mrs. ARNOLD's
JOURNAL.</HEAD>
<P>I Set out on my return for England, im|mediately
after the receipt of her la&s;t jour|nal,
the melancholy clo&s;e of which had ex|ceedingly
terrified and afflicted me.</P>
<P>Immediately on my arrival in London, I
flew to the dear friend of my heart; &s;he was
&s;till at her hou&s;e in Pall-mall.</P>
<P>I found the dear Sidney alone, in her
bed-chamber. She had been prepared to
receive me; but, though I had endeavoured
to arm my&s;elf with re&s;olution for this af|fecting
<PB N="402" REF="403">
interview, I was not mi&s;tre&s;s of my|&s;elf
at the &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>The tears I &s;hed, did not &s;pring from that
&s;weet emotion, which long &s;evered friends
feel at &s;eeing each other again; I wept in
&s;orrow for the heavy misfortunes of the be&s;t
of women.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Arnold, &s;till her&s;elf, and &s;u|perior
to adver&s;ity, received me with the
tendere&s;t marks of friend&s;hip, and with a
compo&s;ure that amazed me.</P>
<P>Piety, meekne&s;s, and patience, were ever
Mrs. Arnold's characteri&s;ticks; and they now
all appeared blended, and &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;|&s;ed
on her beautiful face, that I could not
look at her without admiration.</P>
<P>As I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find her &s;o calm
under &s;o trying an affliction, I could not help
expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to that purpo&s;e; but Mrs.
Arnold checked me, with this reply: &startq;I have
been &s;et up as a mark, my Cecilia; let me
fulfil the intention of my Maker, by &s;hew|ing
a perfect re&s;ignation to His will. I
hope, my ta&s;k is almo&s;t fini&s;hed, and that
he will &s;oon permit me to return to the du&s;t
from which I came.&endq;</P>
<P>Frederick Hildy had arrived from Ire|land
above a fortnight before, with Ma&s;ter
Faulkland, a beautiful child of about &s;ix
years old. They were both lodged in Mrs.
Arnold's hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="404">
She told me, that Sir George Bidulph and
Mr. Warner had &s;et out together for Holland,
immediately after the receipt of the letter,
which informed them of Mrs. Falkland's
being alive.</P>
<P>My brother, &s;aid Mrs. Arnold, thought
it nece&s;&s;ary him&s;elf to be the bearer of news
&s;o fatal in its import to his friend. He hop|ed,
be&s;ides, he &s;hould be able to per&s;uade
him to return and &s;tand his trial for having
killed Major Smyth, as there is no doubt
of his being acquitted; all Mr. Bond's fa|mily
being now convinced, from Mrs. Faulk|land's
own confe&s;&s;ion, that there was no|thing
premeditated in this fatal event, and that
what Mr. Faulkland did was in defence of
his own life.</P>
<P>I have writ, continued &s;he, to Mr. Faulk|land,
to endeavour to con&s;ole him under our
mutual misfortune.</P>
<P>At my reque&s;t, &s;he &s;hewed me a copy
of this letter; wherein &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he
would take the tendere&s;t care of his &s;on,
'till the child could be delivered &s;afe into
his hands; and conjured him, for that child's
&s;ake, to be careful of his own intere&s;t and
pre&s;ervation; adding, that as their ill-fated
marriage was an ab&s;olute &s;ecret to
every one but the per&s;ons immediately
concerned, &s;he hoped he would not &s;uffer
the thoughts of it to break in upon his fu|ture
quiet; and concluded with be&s;eech|ing
<PB N="404" REF="405">
him to forget her, as they were never
more to meet.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of what &s;he wrote.
There were no murmurings at her fate,
no womani&s;h complainings, mixed with the
tender, yet noble &s;entiments of her heart,
She endeavoured to conceal her own angui&s;h
under the ma&s;k of contentment, that Mr.
Faulkand might the better &s;upport this final
de&s;truction of all his hopes.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her, whether &s;he had heard &s;ince
from Mr. Faulkland? She told me, &s;he had
as yet received no an&s;wer from him to this
letter, but that &s;he had heard &s;everally from
Sir George and Mr. Warner, who both in|formed
her, that Mr. Faulkland, after his
fir&s;t tran&s;ports of &s;urprize and grief were
over, at receiving this new and unexpected
blow, had grown more calm, and &s;eemed
inclined to return with them to England.
Sir George added, in the la&s;t letter &s;he had
from him, that they only waited 'till Mr.
Warner had accompli&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s that
he had to do in Holland, and hoped, before
a fortnight was at an end, to return home,
and to have the plea&s;ure of conducting Mr.
Faulkland back.</P>
<P>It is ten days, continued Mrs. Arnold,
&s;ince I received this account, and I flatter
my&s;elf, that they may be now on their jour|ney
homeward.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="406">
Mrs. Arnold &s;aid, that &s;he waited but for
Sir George's return, in order to deliver Ma&s;ter
Faulkland into his hands, and that &s;he then
meant to retire into the country, with her two
children, and Patty, the faithful companion
and partner of her grief.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah Bidulph, who would gladly
have gone with Sir George to Holland, had
been per&s;uaded by him to &s;tay behind, in
order to bear his &s;i&s;ter company in her
affliction; and Mrs. Arnold &s;aid, &s;he had
dedicated much of her time to that friendly
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip came to pay her a vi&s;it
whil&s;t I was there. I had never &s;een Lady
Sarah before; and we were introduced to
each other.</P>
<P>I took my leave of Mrs. Arnold, and pro|mi&s;ed
to &s;ee her again the next day.</P>
<P>In the morning, as I was preparing to go
to her, I received a note from Lady Sarah
Bidulph, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting the favour of
&s;eeing me, at her hou&s;e, in St. James's Square,
before I went to Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>I obeyed this unexpected &s;ummons, and im|mediately
waited on her.</P>
<P>I took the liberty, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, of de|&s;iring
to &s;ee you here this morning, at Sir
George's reque&s;t: He arrived late la&s;t night,
and brings mo&s;t melancholy news from
Holland.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="407">
Sir George entered the room while &s;he
&s;poke. After the fir&s;t greetings of friends
long parted were over, I am afraid to a&s;k,
Sir George, &s;aid I, yet am impatient to learn
&s;omething of Mr. Faulkland, your lady has
terribly alarmed me; Mr. Faulkland is not
returned; I dare not enquire the rea&s;on.
Tears in&s;tantly &s;prung into Sir George's eyes.
He returns to more, &s;aid he, his remains are
&s;oon to be conveyed to England to be laid
with his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir, cried I, what will poor Mrs. Arnold
&s;ay to this fre&s;h misfortune?</P>
<P>It was on that account, Madam, he replied,
that we now reque&s;ted to &s;peak with you, be|fore
you &s;aw my &s;i&s;ter. You, who are her
bo&s;om friend, can more tenderly di&s;clo&s;e this
melancholy event than any one. I have not
the courage to &s;ee her. We mu&s;t beg of
you, dear Madam, to prepare the unhappy
Sidney for the news.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him the manner of Mr. Faulkland's
death. I cannot po&s;itively &s;ay, an&s;wered Sir
George, but much I fear he precipitated his
own fate.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, or I, con&s;tantly &s;taid with
him from the time we di&s;clo&s;ed the fatal
account we brought concerning Mrs. Faulk|land.
Knowing as we did the violence of
his temper, we were apprehen&s;ive of &s;udden
and dreadful con&s;equences; but he deceiv|ed
us both; for after the fir&s;t &s;tarts of
<PB N="407" REF="408">
pa&s;&s;ion were over, which though they &s;hock|ed,
did not alarm us, as we expected them,
he a&s;&s;umed a calm re&s;ignation to his fate;
and talked with &s;uch a rational compo&s;ure
of the &s;trange circum&s;tances of this inci|dent,
that we began to entertain hopes, that
the efforts of his rea&s;on, joined to our con|&s;tant
endeavours to &s;ooth and con&s;ole him,
would in time &s;o far &s;ucceed, as though we
never expected to &s;ee him re&s;tored to a
tranquil &s;tate of mind, we yet flattered our|&s;elves
he would &s;ubmit to life upon &s;uch
terms as Providence thought fit to impo&s;e on
him.</P>
<P>I was with him, proceeded Sir George,
when he received a letter from my &s;i&s;ter.
His hands &s;hook &s;o on perceiving by the
&s;uper&s;cription that it came from her, that he
let the letter drop. Read it for me, Bidulph,
&s;aid he, and tell me how it fears with Mrs.
Arnold.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly complied with his reque&s;t. I
found by the date of the letter that it had been
delayed much longer than it ought to have
been, which I immediately ob&s;erved to him,
as he had often expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s at not
hearing from my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold is well, &s;aid I, giving him the
letter; read what &s;he &s;ays, and let her teach
you fortitude.</P>
<P>He withdrew to a window to peru&s;e it.
After he had read it, I admire your &s;i&s;ter's
<PB N="408" REF="409">
&s;toici&s;m, &s;aid he, &s;tepping back to his chair.
This is true philo&s;ophy, laying his finger
on the letter which he &s;till held in his hand.
<HI>Her</HI> heroic &s;oul is &s;till unmoved, and above
the reach of adver&s;ity. Happy Mrs. Arnold.
&mdash;What a vain fool was I to think that
&s;uch a mind as <HI>hers</HI> could be &s;ubdued. He
pau&s;ed and &s;eemed for a while buried in
thought. Then putting the letter up in his
pocket, lie began to di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ome other
topic.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the evening together, continued
Sir George, and though Faulkland was far
from being chearful, I thought he appeared
more tranquil than he had done &s;ince my
arrival.</P>
<P>I talked to him of his returning to England
with me. He &s;aid with a &s;mile, I think I
ought. to go if it were for no other rea&s;on
but that I may have my du&s;t mingled with
that of my forefather's; and this office, Bi|dulph,
I expect from you, if you &s;hould out|live
me.</P>
<P>I laughed at him, and &s;aid I thought he had
a much more material rea&s;on that pre&s;&s;ed his
return.</P>
<P>Your e&s;tate, &s;aid I, is un&s;ettled; and if you
were to die abroad in the predicament in
which you now &s;tand, what is to become of
your &s;on?</P>
<P>I have already done for my &s;on, &s;aid he, all
<PB N="409" REF="410">
that I thought in ju&s;tice was in my power to
do: I have long ago &s;ettled my per&s;onal for|tune
on him, that in ca&s;e my next heirs,
&s;hould on account of the illegitimacy of his
birth, claim the family e&s;tate, he may have a
hand&s;ome &s;upport without it.</P>
<P>And indeed I never wi&s;hed to debar my
lawful heirs in favour of this child; though I
love him tenderly, and they are worthle&s;s peo|ple,
whom I de&s;pi&s;e, and with whom I never
had any intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>I replied, if that were &s;o, as the manner of
the child's birth was a &s;ecret, I wi&s;hed he
might, undi&s;turbed, inherit his father's fortune,
when he &s;hould come to pay the la&s;t debt to
nature.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, where &s;uch a va&s;t property
was at &s;take, there would not be people
wanting who&s;e intere&s;t would engage them
to di&s;cover the &s;ecret; and he doubted not
but the irregularity of his wife's conduct,
had already occa&s;ioned enquiries to be
made.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, &s;aid I, you had had another
&s;on by Mrs. Faulkland &s;ince your marriage
&mdash;as you could have no objection to the
bequeathing your fortune to him, would it
not have appeared &s;trange in the eyes of the
world that you &s;hould di&s;inherit your elde&s;t
&s;on?</P>
<P>It might have appeared &s;o, &s;aid he, but
I certainly &s;hould have done it: and for
<PB N="410" REF="411">
that rea&s;on, as I have no child but him, I
have made &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of my fortune
as I now tell you. If I live, I may increa&s;e
my &s;on's patrimony; if not he mu&s;t be
contented with that which I have bequeath|ed
to him, and let my kindred &s;cramble for
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We &s;taid together till it was late; he di&s;|cour&s;ed
on a variety of &s;ubjects, but mention|ed
not my &s;i&s;ter's name during the whole
time.</P>
<P>I thought I left him well, and his mind to|lerably
compo&s;ed. We were to &s;et out on our
return in &s;ix days; but an account was brought
to me in the morning, that Mr. Faulkland
was found dead in his bed.</P>
<P>There were no &s;ymptoms di&s;covered on the
body that could let us into the occa&s;ion of his
death; but as my own fears &s;ugge&s;ted too
much, I cho&s;e not to be particular in my en|quiries.
Wi&s;hing rather that his fatal &s;tory
&s;hould be buried in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner found that his affairs were
likely to delay him longer than the time pro|po&s;ed;
and as I had nothing farther to detain
me in Holland, I &s;et out the day after my un|fortunate
friend's death, leaving to Mr. War|ner,
the care of conveying his remains to
England, agreeably to the de&s;ire he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
which I now con&s;idered as his la&s;t in|junction
laid on me.</P>
<P>Thus, proceeded Sir George, by a &s;eries of
<PB N="411" REF="412">
fatal events, each of which was occa&s;ioned by
motives in them&s;elves laudable, has one of
the brave&s;t and mo&s;t noble minded men on
earth been cut off in the prime of his youth
&mdash;Oh! Faulkland, why did you &s;uffer that
gallant &s;pirit to be vanqui&s;hed?&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir George's emotion &s;topped his farther
&s;peech. I was too much affected to &s;ay any
thing to him, but took a ha&s;ty leave of Lady
Sarah, in order to go to Mrs. Arnold.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I entered my friend's room,
Cecilia, &s;aid &s;he, if your countenance be as
faithful an interpreter of your mind as it u&s;ed
to be, you have &s;ome thing di&s;a&s;terous to re|late;
you may &s;ay any thing, misfortune and
I have been &s;o familiar, I &s;hall not &s;hrink at
its approach.</P>
<P>Sir George is returned, I replied, you will
&s;ee him to-day.</P>
<P>Is he come alone, &s;he a&s;ked? Alone, I
replied. You but repeat my words, Cecilia,
without adding any thing from your&s;elf. Shall
I interpret the meaning of that mournful echo?
Mr. Faulkland no longer lives!</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent&mdash;Oh I knew him too well, &s;aid
&s;he, rai&s;ing her voice with energy, to think he
would &s;urvive this la&s;t blow.</P>
<P>His death was natural, &s;aid I, for any thing
that appeared to the contrary. God be prai&s;|ed
for that, cried Mrs. Arnold! <HI>If</HI> &s;o, I am
&s;atisfied that he is at peace.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="413">
She then enquired after Mr. Warner, and
her brother, without making any farther
mention of Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were in di&s;cour&s;e, Ma&s;ter Faulk|land
ran into the room. He had been at
play with the two little Mi&s;s Arnolds, who
were in pur&s;uit of him, and he flew to Mrs.
Arnold to hide him. She folded him tenderly
in her arms; then turning to me, look at this
boy, &s;aid &s;he, he is the perfect image of his
father.</P>
<P>When am I to go to my papa? cried the
child, as he hung round her neck: this in|nocent
unexpected demand quite vanqui&s;hed
Mrs. Arnold's fortitude. She &s;et him down,
without being able to an&s;wer his que&s;tion;
then &s;aid, Excu&s;e me, my Cecilia, I would
wi&s;h to be alone for to-day. It was not yet
a &s;ea&s;on to admini&s;ter con&s;olation, and I with|drew.</P>
<P>She &s;taid in London but two days after
this; when, as &s;he had before re&s;olved, &s;he
retired to an e&s;tate in Buckingham&s;hire,
which her kin&s;man had purcha&s;ed and &s;ettled
on her for ever.</P>
<P>With her brother's con&s;ent, &s;he took Ma|&s;ter
Faulkland with her, and prevailed on
Mr. Price to accompany her into the country,
to whom &s;he committed the care of the
child's education.</P>
<P>Mr. Warner, whom &s;he had acquainted
by letter with her intention, approved of the
<PB N="413" REF="414">
&s;tep &s;he had taken. He returned to Eng|land
in about three weeks after her depar|ture
from her hou&s;e in town, which &s;he had
left for his reception, ju&s;t as he had fitted it
up for her.</P>
<P>Before I accompany Mrs. Arnold into her
&s;olitude, I &s;hall ju&s;t briefly mention &s;ome
other per&s;ons, who were connected with her
&s;tory.</P>
<P>The relations of Mr. Faulkland, as he had
fore&s;een, claimed his e&s;tate, and at length
obtained it, the illegitimacy of the child be|ing
proved.</P>
<P>The wretched Mrs. Faulkland, abandoned
and de&s;pi&s;ed, returned to England; but as
&s;he was there hated and &s;hunned by every
one, &s;he remained in ob&s;curity for a few
years, and then died unpitied and unla|mented.</P>
<P>I now return to Mrs. Arnold, who, &s;et|tled
in her quiet retreat in the country, it
might be hoped, would have pa&s;&s;ed the re|mainder
of her days undi&s;turbed by any new
calamity.</P>
<P>That only &s;ource of true heroi&s;m of &s;oul,
religion, had all along &s;upported, and pre|vented
her from &s;inking under the mo&s;t try|ing
afflictions. Many and bitter were the
&s;ufferings &s;he had already endured; but &s;he
was, to u&s;e her own words, <HI>Set up as a
mark;</HI> and the deep afflictions that &s;till pur|&s;ued
her, and clouded even her latter days
<PB N="414" REF="415">
with misfortunes, may &s;erve to &s;hew, that it
is not <HI>here</HI> that true virtue is to look for its
reward. I &s;aw her at a time when this re|flection,
as it had been her chief, &s;o was it
her la&s;t and only con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as &s;he was of an admirable un|der&s;tanding,
and an enlarged mind, in the
deepe&s;t &s;olitude &s;he had always re&s;ources of
entertainment within her&s;elf. Her natural
di&s;po&s;ition, ever &s;weet and complying, was
improved by her &s;ufferings into a patience
very rare in woman; and a re&s;ignation im|bibed
at fir&s;t from a rigid education, was
heightened by religion into an almo&s;t &s;aint|like
meekne&s;s and humility.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the fir&s;t ten years of her
retirement, in which nothing material hap|pened,
but the marriage of the amiable Patty
Main to a gentleman of a large e&s;tate, and
the death of her worthy kin&s;man Mr. War|ner,
who bequeathed her his whole fortune.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold, her elde&s;t daughter, was
now &s;omething more than fifteen, and ful|filled
the promi&s;e her childhood gave, of her
being a perfect beauty. Mi&s;s Cecilia was
about a year younger, and, though not &s;o
hand&s;ome as her &s;i&s;ter, was accounted one of
the fine&s;t young Ladies of her time.</P>
<P>With what delight have I &s;een this ex|cellent
mother, whil&s;t the&s;e two charming
young creatures were all attention, relate to
<PB N="415" REF="416">
them the extraordinary and affecting inci|dents
of her life.</P>
<P>This, &s;aid &s;he, I do, not as a murmurer at
my fate, nor to move your pity at my mis|fortunes,
but to teach you by my example,
that there is no &s;ituation in life exempt from
trouble. It found <HI>me</HI> under the tender care
of the be&s;t of parents, it pur&s;ued me into
my hu&s;band's hou&s;e. In my virgin &s;tate,
when I was a wife, and in my widowhood,
I was equally per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Poverty, I once thought, would have ex|empted
me from every ill, but what its own
hand inflicted; and had it remained my com|panion,
the bittere&s;t misfortune of my life
would have been prevented; for, if wealth
had not accompanied my hand, the world
could not have per&s;uaded me to yield it to
Mr. Faulkland.</P>
<P>Do not therefore pride your&s;elves on the
great fortunes you are likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s: I
have received no other &s;atisfaction in mine,
than what aro&s;e from the benefits I have con|ferred
on others.</P>
<P>By &s;uch le&s;&s;ons as the&s;e, did this tender
parent endeavour to fortify their young minds
again&s;t the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and to
teach them, not to place their confidence in
riches.</P>
<P>She dwelt &s;o often upon this theme, that
&s;he &s;eemed to have a pre-&s;entiment of tho&s;e
<PB N="416" REF="417">
evils, which were now ready to pour in like
a torrent upon her.</P>
<P>Gracious Heaven! how in&s;crutable are thy
ways! Her affluent fortune, the very cir|cum&s;tance
which &s;eemed to promi&s;e her, in
the eve of life, &s;ome compen&s;ation for the
mi&s;eries &s;he had endured in her early days,
now proved the &s;ource of new and dreadful
calamities to her, which, by involving the
unhappy daughters of an unhappy mother,
in &s;cenes of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s, cut
off from her even the la&s;t re&s;ource of hope
in this life, and rendered the clo&s;e of her
hi&s;tory &s;till more. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
&hellip;&hellip;</P>
<P>Here the lady's narrative breaks off, and
the editor, not having it in his power, after
the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, to recover any
more of the manu&s;cript, is, to his great
mortification, compelled to offer this frag|ment.</P>
