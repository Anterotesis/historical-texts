<HEAD>REASONS AGAINST THE <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT Strife is here among you all? And what a Noi&s;e about who &s;hall or &s;hall not be King, <HI>the Lord knows when?</HI> Is it not a &s;trange thing we can't be quiet with the Queen we have, but we mu&s;t all fall into Confu&s;ion and Combu&s;tions about who &s;hall come after? Why, pray Folks, How Old is the Queen, and when is &s;he to Die, that here is this Pother made about it? I have heard wi&s;e People &s;ay the Queen is not Fifty Years Old, that &s;he has no Di&s;temper but the Gout, that is a Long|life Di&s;ea&s;e, which generally holds Peo|ple out Twenty, or Thirty, or Forty Years; and let it go how it will, the Queen may well enough linger out Twenty or Thirty Years, and not be a Huge Old Wife nei|ther.
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Now! What &s;ay the <HI>People,</HI> mu&s;t we think of living Twenty or Thirty Years in this wrangling Condition we are now in? This would be a Torment wor&s;e than &s;ome of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Plagues, and would be intolerable to bear tho' for fewer Years than that. The Animo&s;ities of this Nation, &s;hould they go on, as it &s;eems they go on now, would by time be come to &s;uch a Height, that all Charity, Society, and Mutual Agree|ment among us, will be de&s;troy'd. Chri&s;ti|ans &s;hall we be call'd! No; Nothing of the People call'd Chri&s;tians will be to be found among Us. Nothing of Chri&s;tianity, or the Sub&s;tance of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>viz.</HI> Cha|rity, will be found among Us! The Name Chri&s;tian may be a&s;&s;um'd, but it will be all Hypocri&s;ie and Delu&s;ion; the Being of Chri&s;tianity mu&s;t be lo&s;t in the Fog, and Smoke, and Stink, and Noi&s;e, and Rage, and Cruelty, of our Quarrel about a King. Is this Rational? Is it Agreeable to the true Intere&s;t of the Nation? What mu&s;t become of Trade, of Religion, of Society, of Relation, of Families, of People? Why, hark ye, you Folk, that call your&s;elves Ra|tional, and talk of having Souls, is this a Token of your having &s;uch things about you, or of thinking Rationally; if you have, pray what is it likely will become of you all? Why, the Strife is gotten into
<PB N="3" REF="4">
your Kitchens, your Parlours, your Shops, your Counting-hou&s;es, nay, into your very Beds. You Gentlefolks, if you plea&s;e to li&s;ten to your Cook-maids and Footmen in your Kitchens, you &s;hall hear them &s;colding, and &s;wearing, and &s;cratching, and fighting, among them&s;elves; and when you think the Noi&s;e is about the Beef and the Pudding, the Di&s;h water, or the Kitchen-&s;tuff, alas you are mi&s;taken, the Feud is about the more mighty Affairs of the Government, and who is for the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and who for the Pretender. Here the poor de&s;picable Scullions learn to cry, <HI>High-Church, No Dutch Kings, No Hannover,</HI> that they may do it dexterou&s;ly when they come into the next Mob. Here their An|tagoni&s;ts of the Dripping-pan practi&s;e the other Side Clamour, <HI>No French Peace, No Pretender, No Popery.</HI> The thing is the very &s;ame up one Pair of Stairs, in the Shops and Warehou&s;es the Prentices &s;tand &s;ome on one Side of the Shop, and &s;ome on the other, (having Trade little enough,) and there they throw <HI>High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church</HI> at one another's Heads like Battledore and Shuttlecock; in&s;tead of Po&s;ting their Books, they are Fighting and Railing at the <HI>Pretender</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover;</HI> it were better for us certainly that the&s;e Things had never been heard of. If we go
<PB N="4" REF="5">
from the Shop one Story higher into our Family, the Ladies in&s;tead of their inno|cent Sports and Diver&s;ions, they are all falling out one among another; the Daugh|ters and the Mother, the Mothers and the Daughters; the Children and the Servants; nay, the very little Si&s;ters one among another. If the Chamber-maid is a Slattern, and does not plea&s;e, hang her, &s;he is a Jade; or I war|rant &s;he is a High-Flier; or, <HI>on t'other Side,</HI> I warrant &s;he is a Whig; I never knew one of that &s;ort good for any thing in my Life. Nay, go up to your very Bed-Chambers, and even in Bed, the Man and Wife &s;hall quarrel about it. People! Peo|ple! What will become of you at this rate? If ye cannot &s;et Man and Wife together, nor your Sons and Daughters together, nay, nor your Servants together, how will ye &s;et your Hor&s;es together, think ye? And how &s;hall they &s;tand together Twenty or Thirty Years, think ye, if the Queen &s;hould live &s;o long? Before that time comes if you are not reduc'd to your Wits, you will be &s;tark Mad; &s;o that unle&s;s you can find in your Hearts to agree about this Matter beforehand, the Condition you are in, and by that time will in all likelihood be in, will Ruin us all; and this is one &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why we &s;hould &s;ay No|thing, and do Nothing, about the Succe&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
but ju&s;t let it re&s;t where it is, and en|deavour to be quiet; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to live thus: Further, if <HI>Hannover</HI> &s;hould come while we are in &s;uch a Condition, we &s;hall Ruin him, or he us, that is mo&s;t certain. It re|mains to enquire what will be the I&s;&s;ue of Things. Why, (1.) If ye will pre&s;erve the Succe&s;&s;ion, and keep it right, you mu&s;t &s;ettle the Peace of the Nation; we are not in a Condition to &s;tand by the Succe&s;&s;ion now, and if we go on we &s;hall be wor&s;e able to do &s;o; in his own Strength <HI>Hannover</HI> does not pretend to come, and if he did he mu&s;t mi&s;carry; if not in his own, in who&s;e then but the People of <HI>Britain?</HI> And if the Peo|ple be a weaken'd, divided and deluded, People, and &s;ee not your own Safety to lye in your Agreement among your&s;elves, how &s;hall &s;uch weak Folk a&s;&s;i&s;t him, e&s;pecially again&s;t a &s;trong Enemy; &s;o that it will be your De&s;truction to attempt to bring in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> unle&s;s you can &s;tand by and defend him when he is come; this will make you all like <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Men in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and you will find your&s;elves lifted up to Halters and Gibbets, not to Places and Preferments. Unle&s;s you reconcile your|&s;elves to one another, and bring things to &s;ome better Pa&s;s among the Common Peo|ple, itwill be but to banter your&s;elves to talk of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; for you
<PB N="6" REF="7">
neither will be in a Condition to bring over your Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, or to &s;up|port him on the Throne when you have brought him; and it will not be denied, but to make the Attempt, and not &s;ucceed in it, is to ruin your&s;elves; and this I think a very good Rea&s;on again&s;t the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>Another Argument relates &s;omething to the Family of <HI>Hanover</HI> it&s;elf. Here the Folk are continually fighting and quarrel|ling with one another to &s;uch a Degree as mu&s;t infallibly weaken and di&s;able the whole Body of the Nation, and expo&s;e them to any Enemy, Foreign or Dome&s;tick. What Prince, think you, will venture his Per&s;on with a Party or a Faction, and that a Party cru&s;h'd, and under the Power of their Enemy; a Party who have not been able to &s;upport them&s;elves or their Cau&s;e, how &s;hall they &s;upport and defend him when he comes? And if they cannot be in a Po&s;ture to Defend and Maintain him when they have him, how &s;hall he be en|couraged to venture him&s;elf among them? To come over and make the Attempt here according to his ju&s;t Claim and the Laws of the Land would be indeed his Advantage, if there was a Probability that he &s;hould &s;ucceed, otherwi&s;e the Example of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> is &s;ufficient to warn him again&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="8">
venturing while the Nation is divided, and together by the Ears, as they are here. The whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> we &s;ee, could not defend King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Swedes</HI> and their Pretender; but tho' he had the Majority, and was receiv'd as King over the whole Kingdom, yet it b ing a King|dom divided into Factions and Parties, and tho&s;e Parties raging with bitter Envy and Fury one again&s;t another, even ju&s;t as ours do here, what came of it but the Ruin of King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who was as it were a Pri&s;o|ner in his own Court, and was brought to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Abdicating the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> and of acknowledging the Title of the Pretender to that Crown. Now what can the Elector of <HI>Hannover</HI> expect if he &s;hould make the Attempt here while we are in this divided factious Condition, while the Pretender, back'd by his Party at Home, &s;hall al&s;o have the whole Power of <HI>France</HI> to &s;upport him, and place him upon the Throne?</P>
<P>Let us but look back to a Time when the very &s;ame Ca&s;e almo&s;t fell out in this Na|tion; the &s;ame many Ways it was, that is, in the Ca&s;e of the Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. your Bloody Papi&s;t Per&s;ecuting Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and the Lady <HI>Jane Dudley,</HI> or <HI>Gray.</HI> The late King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. had &s;ettled the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion upon the Lady <HI>Jane;</HI> it was receiv'd
<PB N="8" REF="9">
univer&s;ally as the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is now. The Rea&s;ons which moved the Peo|ple to receive it were the &s;ame, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Safety of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Liberties and Properties of the People, all the Great Men of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Court and Council came readily into this Succe&s;&s;ion, and gave their Oaths, or what was in tho&s;e Days (what&s;oever it may be now) thought equal to an Oath, <HI>(viz.</HI> their Honour,) for the &s;tanding by the Succe&s;&s;or in her taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;aid ju&s;t Right. <HI>Mary,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> was the Pretender; her Mother was Abdicated, (&s;o we call it in this Age,) Repudiated, they call'd it, or Divorc'd. Her Daughter was adjudg'd Illegitimate or Spurious, becau&s;e the Marriage of her Mother was e&s;teemed Unlawful; ju&s;t as our Preteuder is by this Nation &s;ugge&s;ted Spurious, by Rea&s;on of the yet unfolded My&s;teries of his Birth. Again, that Pretender had the whole Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was then the mo&s;t dreaded of any in the World, and was ju&s;t what the <HI>French</HI> are now, <HI>viz.</HI> the Terror of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> If Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was to have the Crown, it was allowed by all that <HI>England</HI> was to be governed by <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Councils and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maxims, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Money and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cruelty. Ju&s;t as we &s;ay now of the Pre|tender, that if he was to come in we &s;hall
<PB N="9" REF="10">
be all govern'd by <HI>French</HI> Maxims, <HI>French</HI> Councils, <HI>French</HI> Money, and <HI>French</HI> Ty|ranny. In the&s;e Things the Pretender <HI>(Mary)</HI> at that Time was the Parallel to our Pretender Now, and that with but very little Difference. Be&s;ides all this &s;he was a Papi&s;t, which was directly contrary to the Pious De&s;ign of King <HI>Edward</HI> in pro|pagating the Reformation. Exactly agree|ing the&s;e Things were with our Succe&s;&s;ion, our Pretender, our King <HI>William,</HI> and his De&s;ign, by &s;ettling the Succe&s;&s;ion for the propagating the Revolution, which is the Reformation of this Day, as the Reforma|tion was the Revolution of that Day. Af|ter this formal &s;ettling of the Succe&s;&s;ion the King (as Kings and Queens mu&s;t) dies, and the Lords of the Council, &s;uppo&s;e Lords Ju&s;tices, as our Law calls them, <HI>they were the &s;ame Thing,</HI> they Meet and Proclaim their Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, as they were oblig'd to do; and what follow'd? Had they been unanimous, had they &s;tuck to one another, had they not divided into Parties, High and Low, they had kept their Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or in &s;pight of all the Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> but they fell out with one ano|ther; High Prote&s;tants again&s;t Low Prote|&s;tants; and what was the Con&s;equence? One Side to ruin the other brought in the Pretender upon them, and &s;o <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Power,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
as it was predicted, came in upon them, and devoured them all. Popery came in, as they fear'd, and all went to Ruin; and what came of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or; Truly they brought Her to Ruin. For fir&s;t bringing her in, and then, by Rea&s;on of their own Strife and Divi&s;ions, not be|ing able to maintain Her in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Crown, which at their Reque&s;t She had taken, She fell into Her Enemies Hand, was made a Sacrifice to their Fury, and brought to the Block. What can be a more lively Repre&s;entation of our Ca&s;e now be|fore us? He mu&s;t have &s;mall Sen&s;e of the State of our Ca&s;e, I think, who in our pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances can de&s;ire the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould take Place. What! Would you bring over the Family of <HI>Hannover</HI> to have them Murther'd? No, no, tho&s;e that have a true Value for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> would by no Means de&s;ire them to come hi|ther, or de&s;ire you to bring them on &s;uch Terms; fir&s;t let the World &s;ee you are in a Condition to Support and Defend them, that the Pretender, and his Power and Alliances of any kind, &s;hall not Di&s;per&s;e and Ruin him and you together; fir&s;t unite and put your&s;elves into a Po&s;ture that you may defend the Succe&s;&s;ion, and then you may have it; but as it &s;tands now, good Folks, con&s;ider with your&s;elves what Pince in
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<HI>Europe</HI> will venture among Us, and who that has any Re&s;pect or Value for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> can de&s;ire them to come hither.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome good Rea&s;ons why the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover</HI> &s;hould not be our pre&s;ent View. Another Rea&s;on may be taken from the Example of the good People in the Days of King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. they were very Good Religious People, (that mu&s;t be allow'd by all Sides,) and who had very great Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion and the Reformation, as it was then newly e&s;tabli&s;h'd among them; and this Zeal of theirs appear'd plainly in a Degree we can &s;carce hope for among the Prote|&s;tants of this Age, <HI>viz.</HI> in their Burning for it afterwards; yet &s;uch was their Zeal for the Hereditary Right of their Royal Family, that they cho&s;e to fall into the Hands of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tyranny, and of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Popery, and let the Prote&s;tant Religion and the Hopes of its E&s;tabli&s;hment go to the D&mdash;l, rather than not have the Right Line of their Princes kept up, and the Elde&s;t Daughter of their late King <HI>Henry</HI> come to the Crown. Upon this Principle they for&s;ook their good Reforming King <HI>Ed|ward</HI>'s Scheme, rejected the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and they them&s;elves, Prote&s;tants, &s;incere Prote&s;tants, &s;uch as afterwards died
<PB N="12" REF="13">
at a Stake for their Religion, the Prote&s;tant Religion; yet they brought in the Preten|der according to their Principles, and run the Ri&s;que of what could follow thereupon. Why &s;hould we think it &s;trange then that Prote&s;tants now in this Age, and Church of <HI>England</HI> Prote&s;tants too, &s;hould be for a Papi&s;h Pretender? No doubt but they may be as good Prote&s;tants as the <HI>Suffolk</HI> Men in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time were, and if they are brought to it, will go as far, and die at a Stake for the Prote&s;tant Religion, and in doing this, no doubt, but it is their real Pro&s;pect to die at a Stake, <HI>or they would not do it to be &s;ure.</HI> Now the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, the whole Work of Reformation, the Safety of the Nation, both as to their Li|berties and Religion, the keeping out <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Popery, the dying at a Stake, and the like, being always e&s;teem'd Things of much le&s;s Value than the faith|ful adhering to the Divine Rule of keeping the Crown in the Right Line. Let any trne Prote&s;tant tell me, how can we pre|tend to be for the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion? It is evident that the Divine Hereditary Right of our Crown is the Main Great Article now in Debate. You call &s;uch a Man the Pretender, but is he not the Son of our King? And if &s;o, what is the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion to us? Had we not much better be
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Papi&s;ts than Traytors? Had we not much better deny our God, our Bapti&s;m, our Re|ligion and our Lives, than deny our lawful Prince, our next Male in a Right Line? If Popery comes, Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience is &s;till our Friend; we are Prote&s;tants; we can Die, we can Burn, we can do any Thing but Rebel; and this being our fir&s;t Duty, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Recognize our Rightful Sovereign, are we not to do that fir&s;t? And if Popery or Slavery follow we mu&s;t act as becomes us. This being then Orthodox Doctrine, is equally a Sub&s;tantial Rea&s;on why we &s;hould be again&s;t the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There may be &s;undry other Rea&s;ons given why we &s;hould not be for this New E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Succe&s;&s;ion, which tho' perhaps they may not &s;eem &s;o Cogent in them&s;elves, have yet a due Force, as they &s;tand related to other Circum&s;tances, which this Nation is at pre&s;ent involved in, and therefore are only left to the Con&s;ideration of the People of the&s;e Times. No Que|&s;tion but every Hone&s;t <HI>Britain</HI> is for a peaceable Succe&s;&s;ion: Now if the Preten|der comes, and is quickly e&s;tabli&s;h'd on the Throne, why then you know there is an End of all our Fears of the Great and Formidable Power of <HI>France;</HI> we have no more need to fear an Inva&s;ion, or the Effects of leaving <HI>France</HI> in a Condition by the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Peace to act again&s;t Us, and not the Pre|tender upon us; and therefore Peace being of &s;o much Con&s;equence to this Nation, af|ter &s;o long and &s;o cruel a War, none can think of entering upon a New War for the Succe&s;&s;ion without great Regreat and Horror. Now it cannot be doubted but the Succe&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Hannover</HI> would nece&s;&s;arily involve us again in a War again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and that perhaps when we may be in no good Ca&s;e to undertake it for the&s;e Rea&s;ons. (1.) Perhaps &s;ome Princes and States in the World by that Time, &s;eeing the great Encrea&s;e and Growth of <HI>French</HI> Power, may think fit to change their Sentiments, and rather come over to that Intere&s;t for want of being &s;upported before, than be willing to Embark again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o it may not be po&s;&s;ible to obtain a New Confederacy in the Degree and Extent of it, which we have &s;een it in, or in any Degree &s;uitable to the Power of <HI>France;</HI> and if &s;o, there may be but &s;mall Hopes of Succe&s;s in Ca&s;e of a new Rupture; and any War had better be let alone than be carried on to Lo&s;s, which often ends in the Overthrow of the Party or Nation who undertake it, and fails in the carrying it on. (2.) <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf, as well by the Acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e Princes who may have chang'd Sides, as above, as by a Time for taking Breath after
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the Lo&s;&s;es they have receiv'd, may be rais'd to a Condition of Superiour Strength, and may be too much an Over-match for us to venture upon; and if he thinks fit to &s;end us the Per&s;on we call the Pretender, and order us to take him for our King, and this when we are in no Condition to with&s;tand him, Prudence will guide as to accept of him; for all People comply with what they cannot avoid; and if we are not in a Con|dition to keep him out, there wants very little Con&s;ultation upon the Que&s;tion, whe|ther we &s;hall take him in? Or no? Like this is a Man, who being condemn'd to be Hang'd, and is in Irons in the Dungeon at <HI>Newgate,</HI> when he &s;ees all Po&s;&s;ibility ei|ther of Pardon from the Queen, or E&s;cape out of Pri&s;on, what does he re&s;olve upon next? What! Why he re&s;olves to die. What &s;hould he re&s;olve on? Every Body &s;ubmits to what they cannot e&s;cape. Peo|ple! People! If ye cannot re&s;i&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King, ye mu&s;t &s;ubmit to a <HI>French</HI> Preten|der. There is no more to be &s;aid about that. (3.) Then &s;ome Allies, who it might be thought would be able to lend you &s;ome Help in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this is, may pretend to be di&s;gu&s;ted at former U&s;age, and &s;ay they were abandoned and for&s;aken in their Occa&s;ion by us, and they will not hazard for a Nation who di&s;oblig'd them
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;o much before, and from whom they have not receiv'd &s;uitable Returns for the Debt of the Revolution. And if the&s;e Nations &s;hould take Things &s;o ill, as to refu&s;e their Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in a Ca&s;e of &s;o much Nece&s;&s;ity as that of the Succe&s;&s;ion, how &s;hall we be able to maintain that Attempt? And (as before) an Attempt of that, or any other Kind like that, is better unmade than Ineffectually made. (4.) Others add a yet farther Rea&s;on of our probable Inability in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Enemies of <HI>Britain</HI> have &s;o mi&s;repre&s;ented Things to &s;ome of the Neighbouring Nations, our good Friends and Allies, as if we <HI>Britains</HI> had betray'd the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and not acted faithfully to our Confederacies and Alliances, in which our Reputation, it is pretended, has &s;uffer'd &s;o much, as not to merit to be tru&s;ted again in like Ca&s;es, or that it &s;hould be &s;afe to depend upon our mo&s;t Solemn Engagement. This, tho' it is Invidious and Har&s;h, yet if there may be any Truth in it, as we hope there is not, may be added as a very good Rea&s;on why, after this War is over, we may be in no good Ca&s;e at all to Undertake or to Carry on a New War in Defence of the New Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, when it may come to be nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to do. Since then the Succe&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Hannover</HI> will nece&s;&s;arily involve us

<P>But yet I have other Rea&s;ons than the&s;e, and more Cogent ones; Learned Men &s;ay, &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es in Nature are Cured by Antipathies, and &s;ome by Sympathies; that the Enemies of Nature are the be&s;t Pre&s;ervatives of Nature; that Bodies are brought down by the Skill of the Phy&s;i|cian that they may the better be brought up, made Sick to be made Well, and carried to the Brink of the Grave in order to be kept from the Grave; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and in order to the&s;e Things, Poi&s;ons are admini|&s;tred for Phy&s;ick; or Amputations in Surgery, the Fle&s;h is cut that it may heal; an Arm laid open that it may clo&s;e with Safety; and the&s;e Methods of Cure are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t certain as well as mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e particular Ca&s;es, from whence it is become a Pro|verbial Saying in Phy&s;ick, <HI>De&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have De&s;perate Remedies.</HI> Now it is very proper to enquire in this Ca&s;e whe|ther the Nation is not in &s;uch a State of Health at this Time, that the Com|ing of the Pretender may not be of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, by Way of Cure of &s;uch National Di&s;tempers which now

If the Phy&s;icians pre&s;cribe a Vomit for the Cure of any particular Di&s;temper, will the Pati|ent complain of being made Sick? No, no; when you begin to be Sick, then we &s;ay, Oh, that is Right, and then the Vomit be|gins to work; and how &s;hall the I&s;land of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;pue out all the Dregs and Filth the Publick Dige&s;ture has contracted, if it be not made Sick with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ick?

<P>The Pretender will no doubt bring us good Medicines, and Cure us of all our Hypochondria$k Vapours that now make us &s;o giddy But &s;ay &s;ome, he will bring Popery in upon us; Popery, &s;ay you! Alas! It is true, Popery is a &s;ad Thing, and that &s;ay &s;ome Folk ought to have been

Why, &s;ay the Hone&s;t Folk, the Pretender is a Papi&s;t, and if a Popi&s;h Prince come upon the Throne we &s;hall have Po|pery come in upon us without fail: Well, well, and what Hurt will this be to you? May not Popery be very good in its Kind? What if this kopery, like the Vomit made of Poi&s;on, be the only Phy&s;ick that can cure you? If this Vomit make you &s;pue out your Filth, your Tory Filth, your Idolatrous Filth, your Tyrannick Filth, and re&s;tore you to your Health, &s;hall it not be good for you? Where pray ob&s;erve in the Allegory of Phy&s;ick; you heard before when you take a Vomit, the Phy&s;ick given you to vomit is always &s;omething contrary to Nature, &s;omething that if taken in Quan|tity would de&s;troy; but how does it ope|rate? It attacks Nature, and puts her upon a Ferment to ca&s;t out what offends her: But remark it, I pray, when the Patient vomits, he always vomits up the Phy&s;ick and the Filth together: So, if the Nation &s;hould take a Vomit of Popery, as when the Pretender comes mo&s;t certain it is that this will be the Con&s;equence, they will vomit up the Phy&s;ick and the Filth together; the Popery and the Pretender

Ob&s;erve, People! This is no New Applica|tion; the Nation has taken a Vomit of this Kind before now, as in Queen <HI>Mary</HI> I. Time; the Reformation was not well chewed, and being taken down whole, did not rightly dige&s;t, but left too much Crudity in the Stomach, from whence proceeded ill Nouri&s;hment, bad Blood, and a very ill Habit of Body in the Con&s;titution; Wit|ne&s;s the Di&s;temper which &s;eized the Go&s;|pellers in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who being &s;truck with an Epilep&s;ie or Dead Pal&s;ie in the better half of their Under&s;tanding, to wit, the Religious and Zealous Part, took up Arms for a Popi&s;h Pretender, again&s;t the Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, upon the wild headed Whim|&s;ie of the <HI>Right Line</HI> being <HI>Jure Divino:</HI> Well, what followed, I Pray?

Right &s;pued out Popery al&s;o along with it.

Nay, why &s;hould we not open our Eyes and &s;ee how much to our Advantage it may be in the next Reign to have Popery brought in, and to that End the Pretender &s;et up, that he may help us to this mo&s;t u&s;eful Do&s;e of Phy&s;ick? The&s;e are &s;ome other of my Rea&s;ons again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Sue|ce&s;&s;ion; I think they cannot be mended: It may perhaps be thought hard of that we &s;hould thus &s;eem to make light of &s;o ter|rible a Thing as Popery, and &s;hould je&s;t with the Affair of the Prote&s;tants: No, People! No; this is no Je&s;t, taking Phy&s;ick is no Je&s;t at all; for it is u&s;eful many Ways, and there is no keeping the Body in Health without it, for the Corruption of Politick Con&s;titutions are as Gro&s;s and as Fatal as tho&s;e of Human Bodies, and require as immediate Application of Medi|cines. And why &s;hould you People of this Country be &s;o alarmed, and &s;eem &s;o a|fraid of this Thing called Popery, when it is &s;poken of in Intelligible Terms, &s;ince you are not afraid alternately to put to your Hands

If it &s;hould be asked how have the&s;e any &s;uch Reference? The Que&s;tion is mo&s;t Na|tural from the Premi&s;es: If Divi&s;ions weak|en the Nation; if Whig and Tory, even united, are, and have been, weak enough to keep out Popery; &s;urely then Widen|ing the unnatural Breaches, and Enflaming Things between them to implacable and irreconcilable Breaches, mu&s;t tend to over|throw the Prote&s;tant Kingdom, which, as our Everble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;aid, when <HI>divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand.</HI> Be&s;ides, are not your Breaches come up to that Height already as to let any Impartial By-&s;tander &s;ee that Popery mu&s;t be the Con&s;equences?

Why then, while you are Obliquely, and by Con&s;e|quences, joining your Hands to bring in Popery, why, O di&s;tracted Folk! &s;hould you think it ami&s;s to have me talk of doing it Openly and Avowedly?

by declaring the De&s;ign, true Intent and Meaning, of the Thing it&s;elf; for the Good or Evil of every Action is &s;aid to lye in the Intention; if then we can prove the bringing in the Pretender to be done with a Real Intention and Sincere De&s;ign to keep him out; or, as before, to &s;pue him out; if we bring in Popery with an Intention and a Sincere De&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h the Prote&s;tant Religion; if we bring in a Popi&s;h Prince with a &s;ingle De&s;ign the firmer and better to fix and introduce the Prote&s;tant <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion; if I &s;ay the&s;e Things are the true Intent and Meaning, and are at the Bottom of all our Actions in this Matter, pray how &s;hall we be &s;aid to be Perjured, or to break in upon the Abjuration, who&s;e Meaning we keep whatever becomes of the Literal Part of it.

Now upon a more &s;e|date Con&s;idering the Matter, &s;ay they, the Ca&s;e is clear that this Per&s;on is the real Son of King <HI>James,</HI> and the Favour|ers of the Revolution go now upon ano|ther Foundation, <HI>(viz)</HI> the Powers of Parliaments to limit the Succe&s;&s;ion; and that Succe&s;&s;ion being limited upon King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, which they call Volun|tary: So that now, &s;ay they, the Que&s;tion about the Legitimacy of the Per&s;on called the Pretender is over, and nothing now is to be &s;aid of it: That he is the Son of King <HI>James,</HI> there is, &s;ay they, no more Room to doubt, and therefore the Do|ctrine of Hereditary Right taking Place, as the Ancient profe&s;&s;ed Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> there can be no Objection again&s;t his being our Lawful King; and it is contrary to the &s;aid Church of <HI>England</HI> Doctrine to deny it. This then is the pre&s;ent Rea&s;on which the poor ig|norant People are taught to give why they
<PB N="35" REF="36">
are again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and why they are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to come in|to the New Scheme of a Popi&s;h Preten|der, tho' at the &s;ame Time they are all heartily again&s;t Popery as much as ever.</P>
<P>It becomes nece&s;&s;ary now to explain this Ca&s;e a little to the Under&s;tanding of the Common People, and let them know upon what Foundation the Right of the&s;e Two Parties is founded, and if this be done with Plainne&s;s and Clearne&s;s, as by the Rights and Laws of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and <HI>Britains</HI> appertaineth, the &s;aid Commons of <HI>Britain</HI> may &s;oon di&s;cover whether the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> or the Claim of the Per&s;on called the Preten|der, is founded be&s;t, and which they ought to adhere unto. The Fir&s;t Thing it &s;eems to be made clear to the Com|mon People is, Whether the Pretender was the Lawful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> Yea, or No? And why the contrary to this was not made appear, according to the Promi|&s;es which, they &s;ay, tho' fal&s;ly, were made by the late King <HI>William?</HI> In the fir&s;t Place is to be con&s;idered, that the Declaration of the &s;aid King, when P. of <HI>O</HI> putting the &s;aid Ca&s;e in the mode&s;te&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible, had this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>That there were violent Su&s;picions that the &s;aid Per&s;on was not Born of the Queen's Body, and that the Prince re|&s;olved</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
to leave the &s;ame to the Free Parliament, to which throughout the &s;aid Declaration the &s;aid Prince declared Him&s;elf ready to refer all the Grievances which he came over to redre&s;s. <HI>I &s;hall give you this in the Words of a late Learned Author upon that Head.</HI></P>
<P>That before a Free Parliament could be obtained, King <HI>James</HI> withdrew him&s;elf, and carried away his Pretended Son into the Hands of the Ancient Enemies of this Nation, and of our Religion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> there to be Educated in the Principles of Enmity to this his Native Countrey.</P>
<P>By which Action he not only declined to refer the Legitimacy of his &s;aid Son to the Examination of the Parliament, as the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had offered in his &s;aid Declaration, but made &s;uch Examination altogether &V;&s;ele&s;s and Impracticable, he him&s;elf (King <HI>James)</HI> not owning it to be a Legal Parliament, and therefore not con&s;enting to &s;tand by &s;uch Ex|amination.</P>
<P>By the &s;aid Abdication, and carrying away his &s;aid pretended Son into the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> to be Educated in Popery, &amp;c. he gave the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> abundant Rea&s;on for ever to exclude the &s;aid King <HI>James</HI> and his &s;aid Pretend|ed Son from the Government of the&s;e Realms, or from the Succe&s;&s;ion to the &s;ame, and made
<PB N="37" REF="38">
it ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary for them to do &s;o, if they would &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant Religion to $word$ and their Po&s;terity; and this with|out $word$ Regard to the Doubt, whether he was the $awful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> or no, &s;ince it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of this Prote&s;tant Nation to be Governed by a Popi&s;h Prince.</P>
<P>The Proof of the Legitimacy being thus &s;tated, and all the violent Su&s;pici|ons of his not being Born of the Queen being thus confirmed by the Abdication of King <HI>James,</HI> come we next to examine how far this Abdication could forfeit for this Pretender, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be the real Son of King <HI>James,</HI> this returns upon the Right of the Parliament to limit the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ing King <HI>James</HI> had had no Son at all; if the Abdication be granted a lawfully making the Throne vacant, it will be very hard to a&s;&s;ign a Cau&s;e why the Parliament might not name a Succe&s;&s;or while the Father was alive, who&s;e Right had no violent Su&s;picions attending it, and not why they might not name a Succe&s;&s;or tho' the Son was living: That the Father's Abdication forfeited for the Son is no Part of the Que&s;tion before us; for the Father is not &s;aid to forfeit his
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Right at all; no one ever que&s;tioned his Right to Reign, nor, had he thought fit to have &s;taid, could the Parliament have named a Succe&s;&s;or, unle&s;s, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, he had made a Voluntary Re&s;ignation or Renunciation of the Crown, and of his Peoples Allegiance; but the King having voluntarily abdicated the Throne, this was as Effectual a Re|lea&s;ing his Subjects from their Allegiance to him, as if he had read an In&s;trument of Re&s;ignation, ju&s;t as King <HI>Richard</HI> did; all the Articles of &s;uch a Re&s;ignation were naturally contained in the &s;aid Abdi|cation, except the naming the Succe&s;&s;or, as effectually as if they had been at large repeated; and &s;ince the Re&s;igning the Crown has been formerly practiced in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and there is &s;o eminent an Exam|ple in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory of the &s;ame, it will que&s;tionle&s;s be of U&s;e to the Reader of the&s;e Sheets to have the Particulars of it before his Eyes, which for that Purpo&s;e is here &s;et down at large, as it was done in the Pre&s;ence of a great Number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Peers, who attended the King for that Pur|po&s;e, and is as follows.</P>
<P>IN the Name of God, <HI>Amen.</HI> I <HI>Richard,</HI> by the Grace of God, King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Ireland,</HI> do hereby

acquit and di&s;charge all Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, and Earls, Barons, Lords, and all other my Subjects, both Spiritual and Secular, of what Degree &s;oever, from their Oath of Fealty and Homage, and all other Bonds of Allegiance, to me due from them and their Heirs, and do hereby relea&s;e them from the &s;aid Oath and Allegiance, &s;o far as they concern my Per&s;on, for ever.</P>
<P>I al&s;o re&s;ign all my Kingly Maje&s;ty and Dignity, with all the Rights and Privileges thereunto belonging, and do renounce all the Title and Claim which I ever had, or have, to them. I al&s;o renounce the Government of the &s;aid Kingdom, and the Name and Royal Highne&s;s thereunto belonging, freely and wholly, and &s;wearing upon the Evangeli&s;ts that I will never oppo&s;e this my Voluntary Re&s;igna|tion, nor &s;uffer it to be oppo&s;ed, as judging my&s;elf not unworthily depo&s;ed from my Regal Dignity for my De&s;erts.</P>
<P>This Re&s;ignation being read again in Parliament, they grounded the Depo&s;ing King <HI>Richard</HI> upon it, and declared him accordingly Depo&s;ed, that is, declared the Throne Vacant; and immediately, by Ver|tue of their own undoubted Right of Li|miting the Succe&s;&s;ion, named the Succe&s;&s;or. See the Form in the Hi&s;tory of that Time thus.</P>

That the Throne was vacant by the Volun|tary Ce&s;&s;ion and Ju&s;t Depo&s;ition of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, and that therefore according to their undoubted Power and Right &s;o to do, they ought forthwith to the Naming a Succe&s;&s;or to fill the &s;aid Throne, which they forthwith did, by Na|ming and Proclaiming <HI>Henry,</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> to be King, &amp;c.</P>
<P>See the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> Vol. Fol. 287.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ame Thing with King <HI>James</HI>'s Abdication, and King <HI>James</HI>'s Ab|dication was no le&s;s or more than an Effe|ctual Re&s;ignation in Form; now the Par|liament, upon the Re&s;ignation of the Crown by the King, having a manifold and mani|fe&s;t Right to &s;upply the Throne &s;o become vacant, had no Obligation to regard the Po&s;terity of the Abdicated Prince, &s;o far as any of them are concerned in or in|volved by, the &s;aid Abdication, and there|fore con&s;idered of E&s;tabli&s;hing and Limit|ing the Succe&s;&s;ion, without mentioning the Rea&s;ons of the De&s;cent, having the Rea&s;on in them&s;elves: But &s;uppo&s;e the Son of King <HI>James</HI> had been allowed Le|gitimate, yet as the Father had involved him in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances with him|&s;elf, by fir&s;t carrying him out of the King|dom,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
and afterwards educating him in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Religion, he became abdicated al&s;o with his Father: Neither doth the being Voluntary or not Voluntary alter the Ca&s;e in the lea&s;t, &s;ince in the Laws of <HI>England</HI> a Father is allowed to be able to for|feit for him&s;elf and for his Children, and much more may he make a Re&s;ignation for him&s;elf and his Children, as is daily practiced and allowed in Law in the Cut|ting off Intails and Remainders, even when the Heir Intail is in Being, and under Age. The People of <HI>Britain</HI> ought not then to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impos'd upon in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; for tho' the Pre|tender were to be own'd for the Lawful Son of King <HI>James,</HI> yet the Abdication of King <HI>James,</HI> his Father, and e&s;pecially his own Pa&s;&s;ive Abdication, was as Ef|fectual an Abdication in him as if he had been of Age, and done it Voluntarily him&s;elf, and &s;hall be allowed to be as binding in all re&s;pects in Law as an Heir in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Cutting of an Heir Intail. If this is not &s;o, then was the Settlement of the Crown upon King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Unrighteous, and tho&s;e Two Famous Princes mu&s;t be recorded in Hi|&s;tory for Parricides and U&s;urpers; nor will it end there, for the Black Charge mu&s;t

This is a Heavy Charge upon her Maje&s;ty, and very In|con&s;i&s;tent with the great Zeal and Affecti|on with which all the People of <HI>Britain</HI> at this Time pay their Duty and Allegi|ance to her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, and ac|knowledge her Happy Government: This may indeed be thought hard, but it is evi|dent nothing le&s;s can be the Ca&s;e, and therefore tho&s;e People who are &s;o forward to plead the Pretender's Cau&s;e, on Account of his being King <HI>James</HI>'s Lawful Son, can do it upon no other Terms than the&s;e,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
<HI>(viz.)</HI> To declare that the Queen is her&s;elf an Illegal Governour, an U&s;urper of ano|ther's Right, and therefore ought to be De|po&s;ed: Or, that the Hereditary Right of Princes is no Indefea&s;ible Thing, but is &s;ubjected to the Power of the Limitations by Parliament. Thus I think the great Difficulty of the Pretender's being the Right|ful Son of the late King <HI>James</HI> is over, and at an End; that it is no Part of the needful Enquiry relating to the Succe&s;&s;i|on, &s;ince his Father involved him in the Fate of his Abdication, and many Ways rendered him incapable to Reign, and out of Condition to have any Claim; &s;ince the Power of limiting the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown is an Undoubted Right of the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> and of <HI>Scot|land</HI> re&s;pectively. Moreover, his being E|ducated a Papi&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> and continu|ing &s;o, was a Ju&s;t Rea&s;on why the People of <HI>England</HI> rejected him, and why they ought to reject him, &s;ince according to that Famous Vote of the Commons in the Convention Parliament, &s;o often Printed, and &s;o often on many Accounts Quoted, it is declared, <HI>That it is Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of this Prote&s;tant Kingdom to be Govern'd by a Popi&s;h Prince.</HI> Vid. <HI>Votes of the Convention, Feb.</HI> 2. 1688.

What then is the Signification to the People of <HI>Britain</HI> whether the Per&s;on cal|led the Pretender be Legitimate, or no? The Son of King <HI>James,</HI> or the Son of a Cinder-woman?
