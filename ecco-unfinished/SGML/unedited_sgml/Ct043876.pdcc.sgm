<P>I Hope, my being one of that Sex, which naturally Claim the Protection of Yours, will in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure excu&s;e my Pre&s;umption in laying this follow|ing Poem at your Feet. Tho' we Women are in|capable of &s;erving our Country in the Di&s;charge of weighty Affairs, we would not be thought &s;o in&s;ipid a Part of it, as not to admire tho&s;e that are; among which None is more Con&s;picious than your &s;elf.</P>
<P>In You the Worthy Citizen, and Judicious State&s;man, meet without the Vice of either; and from &s;uch Patriots of old, <HI>Rome</HI> became the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World. The Good of Mankind &s;eems your only Study: Your Fa|therly Affection to your Children, Your generous Kind|ne&s;s to your Servants, Your Sincerity and Openne&s;s to your Friends, Your compa&s;&s;ionate Pity to the Poor, Your forgiving Temper towards your Enemies, and the true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ho&s;pitality with which You treat all that have the Honour to know you, proclaim the Greatne&s;s of your Soul. Your hone&s;t Principle, and good Ma|nagement of your Affairs at Home, commanded the Ho|nour of your Bills abroad, and the Tru&s;t which lately was repos'd in you, was faithfully di&s;charg'd to the Ho|nour of <HI>Britain</HI>.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">Then where &s;hall the Weak appeal but to one &s;o fam'd for Equity? And I hope that neither my Sex, nor my Cau&s;e, will render me unworthy of Your Protection. However worthle&s;s the following Pages may be in them|&s;elves, the Rea&s;on of their ill Succe&s;s on the Stage is too notorious, and too long a Story to offer in this Epi&s;tle; tho' for the Satisfaction of my common Readers, I have thought fit to place it in a Preface. I confe&s;s, I cou'd never have thought it criminal to &s;peak the Prai&s;es of tho&s;e Heroes from a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage, to whom the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Europe</HI> owes its Safety.</P>
<P>I am &s;o truly &s;en&s;ible of the Weakne&s;&s;es of my own Performance in this kind, that (however &s;trong my in|clinations were, or whatever I might have pretended to, as the Privilege of a Writer,) I &s;hou'd not have pre&s;um'd to Addre&s;s you, had not my Enemies done me the Ho|nour to make me &s;uffer in &s;o glorious a Cau&s;e; I &s;hall not however abu&s;e the Liberty I now take, by pretend|ing to give the World Your Character in a ful&s;ome un|skillful Panegyrick; but only wi&s;h, for the general Good of my Nation, that it abounded with &s;uch publick Spi|rits as Your own; and that You long may Live, as now You are, the Honour of that City which You grace, as well as for the Intere&s;t and Glory of a free-born People; among which I beg leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Am oblig'd to trouble my Reader with a Preface, that he may not be carried away with fal&s;e Notions, to the Prejudice of this Play, which had the ill Fate to introduce a new Cu|&s;tom, <HI>viz.</HI> in being acted the fir&s;t Day without an Epilogue: It &s;eems the Epilogue de&s;ign'd wou'd not pa&s;s; therefore the Mana|gers of the Theatre did not think it &s;afe to &s;peak it, without I cou'd get it licens'd, which I cou'd not do that Night, with all the Intere&s;t I could make: So that at la&s;t the Play was forc'd to con|clude without an Epilogue. Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>, who is an excellent Comedian in his way, was de&s;ired to &s;peak &s;ix Lines <HI>Extempore</HI>, to entreat the Audience to excu&s;e the Defect, and promi&s;ed them an Epilogue the next Night; but they apprehending that that was the Epilogue de&s;ign'd for the Play, were pleas'd to &s;hew their Re&s;entment. It is plain the want of an Epilogue caus'd the Hi&s;s, becau&s;e there had not been any thing like it during the whole action; but on the contrary a general Clap attended the Conclu&s;i|on of the Play. The next Day I had the Honour to have the E|pilogue Licens'd by the <HI>Vice-Chamberlain</HI>, but by this time there was a Rumour &s;pread about Town, that it was a notorious whig|gi&s;h Epilogue; and the Per&s;on who de&s;ign'd me the Favour of &s;peaking it, had Letters &s;ent her to forbear, for that there were Par$ies forming again&s;t it, and they advis'd her not to &s;tand the Shock; here was a &s;econd Blow greater than the fir&s;t: The &s;inking of my Play cut me not half &s;o deep as the Notion I had, that there cou'd be People of this Nation &s;o ungrateful as not to allow a &s;ingle Compliment to a Man that has done &s;uch Wonders for it. I am not prompted by any private Sini&s;ter End, having never been oblig'd to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>, otherways than as I &s;har'd in common with my Country; as I am an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women, I think my &s;elf oblig'd to acknowledge my Obligation to his Grace for the many Glorious Conque&s;ts he has attain'd, and the many Hazards he has run, to e&s;tabli&s;h us a Nation free from the In|&s;ults of a Foreign Power. I know not what they call Whigs,
<PB REF="5">
or how they di&s;tingui&s;h between them and Tories: But if the De|&s;ire to &s;ee my Country &s;ecur'd from the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Yoke, and flouri&s;h by a Firm La&s;ting Honourable Peace, to the Glory of the be&s;t of Queens, who de&s;ervedly holds the Ballance of all <HI>Europe</HI>, be a Whig, then I am one, el&s;e not. I have Printed the Epilogue, that the World may judge whether 'tis &s;uch as has been repre&s;ented&punc; So much for that. Now I mu&s;t acquaint my Reader, that I &s;hall not pretend to vindicate the following Scenes, about which I took very little Pains, mo&s;t of the Plot being from a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Play, and a&s;&s;uring my &s;elf Succe&s;s from Mr. <HI>Cyber</HI>'s Approbation, who&s;e Opinion was, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s wou'd &s;upport the Play; tho' Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> &s;eem'd to doubt it, and &s;aid, there was a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s, but not laughing Bu&s;ine&s;s; tho' indeed I cou'd not have dre&s;s'd this Plot with much more Humour, there being four Acts in the Dark, which tho' a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Audience may readily conceive, the Night being their proper time of intreaguing; yet here, where Liberty makes Noon-day as ea&s;ie, it perplexes the Thought of an Audience too much; therefore I &s;hall take Care to avoid &s;uch Ab|&s;urdities for the future; and if I live I will endeavour to make my Friends amends in the next.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>EPILOGUE</HI> de&s;ign'd to have been &s;pake the fir&s;t Night by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>IN the&s;e good Times when War i$ like to cea&s;e.</L>
<L>And <HI>Europe</HI> &s;oon expects a gen'ral Peace;</L>
<L>Is Hesus Half-Wits, and Criticks, all may know</L>
<L>I frers <HI>Apollo</HI> come a <HI>Ple$ipo</HI>;</L>
<L>Who well inclin'd to treat, by me thinks fit</L>
<L>To &s;end Propo&s;als from the State of Wit;</L>
<L>Again&s;t &s;uch &s;trong Con&s;ederates engag'd,</L>
<L>An un&s;ucce&s;sful War he long has wag'd;</L>
<L>And now declares, if you will all &s;ubmit</L>
<L>To pay the Charges of his Box and Pit,</L>
<L>He will no more He&s;telities commit.</L>
<L>In all their Works his Poets &s;hall take Care</L>
<L>Never to repre&s;ent you, at you are.</L>
<L>But on the Critick, Judgment &s;hall be&s;tow,</L>
<L>Sen&s;e on the Witling, Beauty on the Bea$.</L>
<L>This for the Men; Next he a&s;&s;ures the Fair,</L>
<L>He grieves this ever he with them made War;</L>
<L>Or ever in his Plays attack'd their Fame,</L>
<L>Or any thing di&s;$l$$'d unfit to name;</L>
<L>O$ C$aracters of faithle&s;s Women drew,</L>
<L>And &s;how'd frign'd Beauties, &s;o unlike the true,</L>
<L>But in all future Scenes the Sex &s;hall &s;ee</L>
<L>Them&s;elves as charming as they wi&s;h to be;</L>
<L>For them he will ordain new Comick Rules,</L>
<L>And never more will make them do$$ on Fo$ls:</L>
<L>And when he ri&s;es to the Tragick Strain,</L>
<L>No$e but true Heroes &s;hall their Favours gain;</L>
<L>Such as that Stranger who has grac'd our Land,</L>
<L>Of equal Fame for Council, and Command,</L>
<L>A Prince, who&s;e Wi&s;dom, Valour, and Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>The gaving World with Acclamations ble&s;s;</L>
<L>By no great Captain in pa&s;t Times outdone,</L>
<L>And in the pre&s;ent $qual'd but by <HI>ONE</HI>.</L>
<L>The&s;e fair Conditions, will, I hope, compo&s;e</L>
<L>All Wars between the Poets and their Foes.</L>
<L>Come Sign the Peace, and let this happy Age</L>
<L>Produce a League in favour of the Stage:</L>
<L>But &s;hou'd this fail, at lea&s;t our Author prays</L>
<L>A Truce may be concluded for &s;ix Days.</L>
