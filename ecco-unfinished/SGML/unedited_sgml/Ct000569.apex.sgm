<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THE LATE <HI>LORD VISCOUNT SACKVILLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER &s;tands forth as the advocate of a great man's fame, whil&s;t he is living, will hardly gain credit for his motives, be they ever &s;o &s;incere; but it is to be hoped there is no &s;uch ri&s;que in de&s;cribing the real merits of one, whom death has removed from all &s;en&s;e of hu|man kindne&s;s, and who has left this world with &s;uch prejudices again&s;t his memory, that the &s;urviving friend who publi&s;hes the&s;e truths in his defence, would better con&s;ult his own intere&s;ts by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
As it is an inviolable principle with me, to bring no man's name before the public without committing my own, I have &s;ub|&s;cribed this paper; and having &s;o done, I hope I may claim belief in the two follow|ing a&s;&s;ertions;&mdash;fir&s;t, that I have in no in|&s;tance of my life been a party-writer, or ever publi&s;hed one line in defence of Lord Sackville, or in prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e of his or any other man's per&s;on or politics;&mdash;&s;econdly, that in what I now &s;hall &s;ay of him, I have &s;poken the truth con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly, to the be&s;t of my knowledge and belief, without flattery or di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>If malice, which is not apt to &s;pend its &s;hafts upon tho&s;e who cannot feel the wound, will &s;uffer this te&s;timony to pa&s;s undi&s;puted, tho&s;e who were inclined to think favorably of him will be plea&s;ed to find they had grounds for their candour; if otherwi&s;e, it will not be the fir&s;t time that, in the pur&s;uit of truth, I have found my&s;elf on the unpopular &s;ide of a que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>It was Lord Sackville's fate to act for &s;everal years in a re&s;pon&s;ible office during
<PB N="3" REF="5">
an unpopular and unpro&s;perous war. In the evil temper of tho&s;e times, it is not to $Word$ wondered at, if a Mini&s;ter, at once &s;o efficient and &s;o out of favour with the public, had a full &s;hare of per&s;onal rancour and animo&s;ity from the opponents to his mea&s;ures. I think however they did not attack him on the &s;core of capacity; his abilities were probably too well e&s;tabli&s;hed for their purpo&s;e; but as they could not deny that he was a capable man, they could in&s;inuate that he was a cunning one, and by this mi&s;con&s;truction of truth, though they could not remove it out of their own way, they contrived to turn it again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I need not remark how often opinions of men's characters are taken up upon di&s;|tant and exterior views only; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that, in this in&s;tance, appear|ances were more in favour of the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion than of the truth; for he was of a grave and thoughtful ca&s;t, mixed but little with the world at large, and his man|ners and deportment had not the ea&s;y freedom of the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion; he talked
<PB N="4" REF="6">
little, and his opinions, being expre&s;&s;ed without circumlocution or he&s;itation, &s;tamped an air of forethought and reflec|tion upon what he &s;aid, which might be charged to the account of &s;tudied prepa|ration and deliberate de&s;ign: he gave much matter in few words, and as he &s;el|dom, if ever, betrayed a heat of temper, a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion might be drawn, that be|cau&s;e he controuled his pa&s;&s;ions, he di&s;|gui&s;ed his heart: nothing could be more oppo&s;ite to his real character: the fact is, &s;incerity was his nature; re&s;erve, con|tracted by long exile from &s;ociety, was the re&s;ult of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>He was brought up at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and took his degrees in the Uni|ver&s;ity of Dublin; but the early avoca|tions of a military life, and perhaps a want of ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition for cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies, prevented his advances in literature, &s;o that in fact he was not &s;o well read as people of his rank and condition ought to be, and indeed generally are; but he knew his weakne&s;s in this particular, and, tho' a willing hearer when the&s;e topics were in
<PB N="5" REF="7">
conver&s;ation, never ventured beyond his knowledge. In the modern hi&s;tory of na|tions, and particularly of his own, he was uncommonly correct; of the memoirs of illu&s;trious per&s;ons, intere&s;ting anecdotes and events, he had a fertile &s;tock in me|mory, and with &s;ingular preci&s;ion of facts and dates; of many con&s;iderable affairs within his own time he had per&s;onal know|ledge, many others (and &s;everal of a curious and &s;ecret nature) he had collected from the be&s;t authorities: he had a happy ta|lent for relating, and having always been given to enquiry and re&s;earch, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing withal a very retentive memory, he may fairly be accounted one of the very be&s;t companions of the age, though he had nei|ther the advantages of literature, the bril|liancy of wit, nor any &s;uperior preten&s;ions to a fine ta&s;te in the elegant arts: it is therefore much to be lamented, that the&s;e plea&s;ant and engaging qualifications for &s;ociety were &s;o &s;paringly di&s;played; and that habit had &s;o contracted his circle, that he could not afterwards, without violence to his nature, extend and enlarge it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
This was con&s;tant matter of regret to me through the whole cour&s;e of my inti|macy with him; and I lamented that any man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch a fund of information, with a benevolence of &s;oul that compre|hended all mankind, a temper mo&s;t placid, and a heart mo&s;t &s;ocial, &s;hould &s;uffer in the world's opinion by that ob&s;curity, to which his ili fortune, not his natural di&s;|po&s;ition, had reduced him; for I am verily per&s;uaded that his bittere&s;t defamers, even the anonymous &s;landerers that raked into the very dregs of infamy and pollution to a&s;per&s;e his character, would have repented had they known him.</P>
<P>He was &s;o little u&s;ed to receive ju&s;tice from mankind, that perhaps he was over-grateful for common approbation; and prai&s;e, if by chance he ever met it, &s;eemed to take his &s;en&s;es by &s;urpri&s;e: if there has been any man therefore, who for &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es a&s;&s;ailed his temper by flattery, it was a ba&s;e and cowardly act; becau&s;e when we attack a man upon that weak quarter which his misfortunes have left undefend|ed, it is aiming our blows at a wound,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
when we cannot conquer by fair fighting. I &s;tate this not &s;o much for the purpo&s;e of applying the ob&s;ervation to him, as in general mitigation for human weakne&s;s, when a per&s;ecuted character has been too rigidly condemned for taking &s;helter in the &s;oothing flattery of a favorite.</P>
<P>He had enough of that good-natured companionable vanity, which delights in doing what it does well, to be very &s;uffi|ciently communicative of what he knew; but he was incapable of laying traps for di&s;cour&s;e, or putting other people's con|ver&s;ation a&s;ide to make room for his own; as he never obtruded, &s;o he never tired: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to admiration that rare faculty of always &s;aying enough, and not too much, on a &s;ubject; his ob&s;ervation was &s;o quick, and his feelings &s;o &s;en&s;itive, that he could nicely di&s;criminate between the plea&s;ure and the politene&s;s of his company, and he never failed to &s;top before the former was exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>In argumentation no man went &s;ooner to the truth, or &s;ubmitted to conviction with a better grace: though he had the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
gift of &s;eeing through a que&s;tion almo&s;t at a glance, yet he never &s;uffered his di&s;cern|ment to anticipate another's explanation, or interrupted his argument, how tedious &s;oever: If any one &s;poke with heat in di&s;pute, or rai&s;ed his voice above its natu|ral pitch, or if more than one &s;peaker talked at a time, it gave him great pain; the&s;e are defects in temper and manners too commonly met with in the world, but to which he never gave occa&s;ion, by pu&s;h|ing an advantage too hard upon any one: a &s;ingle word, or even an offer at inter|ruption, &s;topt him in a moment, though in the middle of a &s;entence; and this I have &s;een him bear repeatedly, and in very many different in&s;tances, without a &s;ymptom of peevi&s;hne&s;s, taking up his thoughts in the very place where he had left them, and re|&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e with perfect compla|cency. To &s;ift out the truth by di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;eemed his only object for conte&s;ting any opinion; and whether that was attained by the re&s;ult of his own or another's rea|&s;oning, was a di&s;covery he had &s;o little de|&s;ire to arrogate to his own &s;agacity, that
<PB N="9" REF="11">
he was very ingenious in &s;hifting it from him&s;elf to any other he conver&s;ed with; for he was an adept in that art, which tends to put others in humour with them&s;elves, and which I take to be of the true &s;pecies of politene&s;s, not laying out for admiration by di&s;play.</P>
<P>To his own ideas he was little attached, to words not at all; and in delivering his thoughts generally cho&s;e the plaine&s;t and commone&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, that could convey their meaning; in this particular he &s;ometimes &s;ell below the dignity of the &s;ubject he was &s;peaking upon; for it was a point with him on all occa&s;ions, to take the &s;traite&s;t road to his object, rather than a circuitous one, though ever &s;o flowery. I believe he was never guilty, either in public or private, of &s;peaking for fame, or &s;etting off a di&s;cour&s;e that means nothing with an air of pomp and my&s;tery; he had a dry way of &s;tripping &s;uch declamations to &s;earch for facts, and would a&s;&s;ert that fine words were not meant to be under|&s;tood; but was particularly plea&s;ed when merchants or men of bu&s;ine&s;s explained
<PB N="10" REF="12">
naturally to his comprehen&s;ion; and when &s;tate-mea&s;ures were to be communicated to any &s;uch for their guidance and in&s;truc|tion, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the &s;ame natu|ral manner, openly and fairly, without af|fectation, ambitious only to be thoroughly under&s;tood as to what would be done, and what would not be done, &s;o that they might thereupon determine what was mo&s;t advi&s;eable for their own intere&s;ts and con|cerns. In per&s;picuity he has never been excelled, in proof of which I believe it is not remembered in Parliament (and pro|bably not in Council), that he was ever called upon a &s;econd time to explain what he had left ob&s;cure and imperfect; his errors, on the contrary, were the errors of &s;incerity; and I dare &s;ay there have been moments, when his colleagues in office could have forgiven him, if he had been $Word$ direct and explicit in reply; but if he was not to be &s;tiled a fine &s;peaker, he was a very ready firm debater, and though he never d$$lt in flowery periods, made no attack upon the pa&s;&s;ions, no &s;tudied decla|mations, yet he had great judgment and
<PB N="11" REF="13">
method in his argument, &s;aw the &s;trong and the feeble of a que&s;tion with much penetration, knew what he ought to pre&s;s, and where he ought to give way; and in giving mea&s;ures a facility, by the choice of the be&s;t moment for their introduction or pro&s;ecution, no man had more &s;kill and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>He was generally repre&s;ented as a proud and di&s;tant man, but in fact he had no more pride at heart, than every man of honour carries about him, and which &s;erves to repel every thing that inclines towards meanne&s;s with becoming indig|nation; upon fir&s;t approaches he had cer|tainly an air of re&s;erve, tempered however with much politene&s;s, for he was a high|bred gentleman, or would have been &s;o e&s;|teemed at lea&s;t in any age but the pre&s;ent, for his manners, it mu&s;t be owned, were not the manners of the reigning fa&s;hion; his re&s;erve however, which was more of a pen&s;ive than proud complexion, &s;oon wore off in conver&s;ation, and he was &s;peedily di&s;po&s;ed, from the openne&s;s of his own heart, to credit others for the &s;incerity of
<PB N="12" REF="14">
theirs: He was &s;o far from a cunning man, that, con&s;idering the danger of late times, and the delicacy of the affairs he was engaged in, I doubt if he was always &s;ufficiently cautious; if he had not had a quick in&s;ight into characters, he was natu|turally more direct than would have been &s;afe with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, or con&s;i&s;tent with his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>He had all the requi&s;ites of a great mi|ni&s;ter, unle&s;s popularity and good luck are to be numbered among&s;t them: In punc|tuality, preci&s;ion, di&s;patch and integrity, he was not to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; he was fitted both by habit and temper for bu&s;ine&s;s; no man could have fewer avocations, whether natural or artificial, for he was &s;lave to no pa&s;&s;ion or exce&s;s, indulged no humour, un|le&s;s that of regularity may be called a hu|mour, which he ob&s;erved to a &s;crupulous minutene&s;s; and as for his dome&s;tic affairs, they were in &s;uch a train of order and oeconomy, that they demanded little of his attention: He had &s;tudied the finances of the nation, and her re&s;ources both in war and peace; had taken uncommon
<PB N="13" REF="15">
pains to obtain authentic and early intel|ligence of the councils and operations of foreign &s;tates, and readily di&s;cerned how the intere&s;ts of this country were affected thereby. He was of an active indefatiga|ble mind: intemperance never di&s;turbed his faculties; neither avarice nor ambi|tion corrupted them; ea&s;y in his private circum&s;tances, and totally void of every wi&s;h to accumulate, his zeal for his coun|try, and his application to bu&s;ine&s;s, were not &s;ubject to be diverted from their pro|per exertions: A &s;cene of a$tivity was what he delighted in, for he was full of operation and project, and of a &s;pirit &s;o incapable of de&s;pondency, that difficulties and dangers, which would have depre&s;&s;ed &s;ome men, &s;erved to animate him.</P>
<P>In the interchange of confidence with him it was nece&s;&s;ary to have no re&s;erve or holding back of circum&s;tances, for he had &s;uch power of &s;eeing into the heart of hy|pocri&s;y, and his own was &s;o free from du|plicity, that on &s;uch occa&s;ions you mu&s;t impart the whole or nothing; when this was fairly done, he was your own to all
<PB N="14" REF="16">
hone&s;t intents, and (humanly &s;peaking) to all time; for he was a &s;teady faithful friend: His mind was &s;o &s;trong, that it could not ea&s;ily be overburthened by the weight of affairs, &s;o clear that the variety of them was not apt to perplex it: He could &s;hift his attention from one thing to its oppo&s;ite with &s;ingular facility; he wi&s;hed to do bu&s;ine&s;s, not to dwell upon it; and as his punctuality, as I before ob&s;erved, went with the hand of the clock to the very point of the minute, he was plea|&s;ant to all who &s;erved with him, or were dependant on his motions, and their hours of relaxation were hours of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of his hou&s;ehold and dome&s;tics was upon a noble &s;cale, in fact it was the model of a liberal oeconomy: He was a friend and father to his &s;er|vants; their health, their exerci&s;es and even their amu&s;ements, were objects of his attention, and a more orderly and happy family did not exi&s;t. When I &s;peak of his bounty and humanity to his poor neighbours and dependants in the coun|ties where he re&s;ided, it is with plea&s;ure
<PB N="15" REF="17">
I in&s;i&s;t on &s;o meritorious a part of his character. Charity was in him no le&s;s the exerci&s;e of the judgment than of the heart, for he gave his relief to the real wants, not to the mere importunities of the needy: money was &s;eldom the vehicle he employed to convey that relief; a con|&s;tant re&s;ource in &s;ickne&s;s, ca&s;ualty, or mis|fortune, was to be found with him, and it was part of his family e&s;tabli&s;hment to be always provided for &s;uch occa&s;ions: As his eye was ever upon the poor, all their comforts, their indu&s;try, and even their mo|rals, pa&s;&s;ed under his in&s;pection, and were influenced by it; his charity was without o&s;tentation, and the extent of his good deeds could only be computed by the la|mentations and number of tho&s;e who fol|lowed his body to the grave.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Providence, that gave him &s;trength to endure, laid afflictions upon him to put that &s;trength to the trial: I am warranted in &s;aying they neither hardened his heart, depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirit, nor &s;oured his temper: It was his countenance, not his tongue, that ever uttered a complaint;
<PB N="16" REF="18">
his friends were welcomed with the &s;ame ho&s;pitable &s;mile, and his family enjoyed the &s;ame unchangeable &s;crenity under all events; if per&s;ecution and unkindne&s;s had been capable of relenting, his patience would have moved them to it.</P>
<P>The cry of the world is not always the opinion of the world, at lea&s;t not of the wi&s;e&s;t part of it; the records are in hand, and the facts cannot be perverted or evaded, by which future times mu&s;t decide, whe|ther he, who was &s;o chief an actor in tho&s;e unhappy &s;cenes, and bore &s;uch a propor|tion of the public odium during the war of the Colonies, &s;hall receive the prai&s;e or cen&s;ure of po&s;terity: He will not enter upon his &s;hare in that unfortunate hi&s;|tory, till the whole was in action and ha&s;|tening to its cata&s;trophe; in the antece|dent mea&s;ures, which have &s;uch connexion with the cau&s;es and precipitation of the revolt, he has no concern; he properly &s;hares the re&s;pon&s;ibility of that Cabinet of which he was a member; and if there was any negligence or error, any want of pro|per di&s;patch and exertion, any corruption,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
ignorance, or abu&s;e, within his particular department, for all &s;uch (if any there were) he is &s;ingly an&s;werable; hitherto we have heard little but the language of prejudice; a &s;hort time will bring the que&s;tion fairly into judgment, and when the heat of pa&s;&s;ion has &s;ub&s;ided, truth will &s;tate, and rea&s;on will decide.</P>
<P>There are other unfortunate events in his life, which mu&s;t be referred to the &s;ame di&s;tant te&s;t and examination. They, who have &s;erved with him in the war preced|ing the la&s;t, are be&s;t able to &s;peak of his military anecdotes: he &s;erved with great reputation under the Dukes of Cumber|land and Marlborough, in Germany, Scot|land, and France; there are pa&s;&s;ages enough in his campaigns, which put his courage out of all di&s;pute; I think it is unnece&s;&s;a|ry to produce them merely for the object of confuting a &s;landerous in&s;inuation, which none but vulgar minds could adopt, and which was never echoed for any pur|po&s;es but of temporary defamation. He was &s;hot in the brea&s;t at the head of Bar|rel's regiment in the memorable battle of
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Fontenoy, and &s;aw that brave regiment almo&s;t totally cut to pieces; if I am rightly informed, only three officers marched unwounded off the field: at the battle of Minden, he was marked by im|plication in the public orders of Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick; he appealed to a court-martial, was tried, &s;entenced, and di&s;graced. I have no further concern with this or any other event of his life, but as it may involve &s;ome good or evil quality of his mind, and affect his private character; in this light I pre&s;ume it is not improper to compare his &s;ituation in the two actions above mentioned, e&s;pecially where a crime has been &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t him, very foreign from his nature, and very different from the rea&s;ons upon which he &s;uffered &s;en|tence; this, and this only, is the point to which I addre&s;s my&s;elf; not to his rightful judges, for that would be the heighth of indecency, but to tho&s;e who, without right to judge, condemned without rea|&s;on; and to &s;uch I may be allowed to &s;ay, that the &s;ituation of Lord Sackville, com|manding a &s;ingle regiment at Fontenoy,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
under an Engli&s;h prince and general, was very different from his &s;ituation at Min|den, commanding the Briti&s;h forces under a foreign prince and general: in the former ca&s;e his duty was only that of an officer; it was &s;imply to fight, and to obey, and that duty he performed; in the latter his duty was that of a general, accountable to his country for &s;omething more than his con|duct in the hour of battle, for his coun&s;els and opinions, and many other compli|cated and delicate affairs, in all which a man, who&s;e zeal for the peculiar intere&s;ts of his own country exceeded any con&s;ide|rations that re&s;pected him&s;elf only, mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to dangers that need not be pointed out; in &s;uch circum&s;tances a &s;ub|ordinate general, though of the &s;ame na|tion with his &s;uperior, has not always thought in harmony with him, and I be|lieve the con&s;equences have generally proved fatal to one party or the other.</P>
<P>I have &s;een him in moments of immi|nent danger, both per&s;onal and political, and never had occa&s;ion to doubt of the firmne&s;s of his mind; I know not how
<PB N="20" REF="22">
el&s;e he could have &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch continued per&s;ecution: I think this circum&s;tance alone would mark his forti|tude to the conviction of every con&s;iderate man, for his deportment was exactly &s;uch as innocence and a clear con&s;cience will in&s;pire; there was no in&s;olence, no fero|city in it, &s;uch as detected characters can a&s;&s;ume, when they have ca&s;t away &s;hame, and hardened them&s;elves again&s;t infamy; his &s;erenity, on the contrary, accompanied him through life, and was particularly con&s;picuous at the clo&s;e of it.</P>
<P>He underwent an irk&s;ome oppo&s;ition, when the favour of his &s;overeign promoted him to a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Peers: it was one of the la&s;t and mo&s;t painful trials of his life: the tran&s;action is &s;o recent, that I may be excu&s;ed from any further mention of it. He did not long enjoy his hard-earned honours. He &s;upported the king's mini&s;ters in all public mea&s;ures, except tho&s;e relative to the Iri&s;h propo&s;i|tions, in which he took a part, not of pur|po&s;ed oppo&s;ition, but of fair and delibe|rate opinion; he had given his be&s;t and
<PB N="21" REF="23">
fulle&s;t attention to the &s;ubject in all its branches, and expected its i&s;&s;ue with the utmo&s;t anxiety. Some time before the conclu&s;ion of the &s;e&s;&s;ion he was &s;eized with the &s;ymptoms of his la&s;t illne&s;s, in which &s;tage of his complaint, if he could have been per&s;uaded to retire from his duty in parliament, he might probably have found a remedy in the air and retirement of the country; but he per&s;i&s;ted &s;o long in his attendance upon this important bu&s;ine&s;s, that his complaint gathered upon him, and his pains grew &s;o trouble&s;ome, that when he came at la&s;t into the country, he did not experience that relief which was hoped for; notwith&s;tanding this, although repo&s;e was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for his condition, his zeal carried him again to town in a very unfit &s;tate for the undertaking: he &s;poke upon the que&s;tion with greater agi|tation of mind, and more at length, than was common with him, and the hou&s;e be|ing hot and crowded, he found him&s;elf &s;o exhau&s;ted at the conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech, that it was with difficulty he was &s;aved from fainting on the &s;pot: the &s;itting was

very long, and he returned to his family very materially altered in his health for the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>From this period he con&s;idered his ca&s;e as without cure, feeling tho&s;e &s;ymptoms of internal decay which he was &s;atisfied were beyond the reach of medicine; in this per&s;ua&s;ion, he even apologized to his phy&s;ician for the fruitle&s;s trouble he was giving him: he endured a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of weari&s;ome pains with &s;ingular &s;erenity and compo&s;ure of mind; his &s;en&s;es were firm and unimpaired to the la&s;t; and he was occupied almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion in fulfilling the duties of a father, a friend, and a Chri&s;tian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was pre&s;ent w$$$&s;t the Holy Sacrament was ad|mini&s;ter$d to him, two days before his d$$th: he cau&s;|ed his windows and bed-curtains to be thrown open, and exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t on that awful occa|&s;ion; he received the Elements with a devotion and fe$vor, expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uch inward peace and even glad|ne&s;s of heart, as are the &s;tronge&s;t of all human evi|dences of an ea&s;y con&s;cience and a well-prepared mind.

the preceding &s;orrows of his life were re|paid to him by that extraordinary &s;upport and comfort which Providence vouch&s;afed to him in his la&s;t days. It is not in my remembrance, through the cour&s;e of my acquaintance with him, ever to have heard a word from his lips that could give offence to decency or religion; but in this latter period, of which I am &s;peaking, and throughout which I con&s;tantly attended him, his &s;entiments were of that exalted and &s;uperior kind, as to render the &s;pec|tacle of his death one of the mo&s;t edify|ing contemplations of my life.</P>
<P>I have now the plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction to know, that it was not without rea&s;on I thought well of one, whom too many con|&s;pired to traduce. Having &s;urvived my friend, I now enjoy the only reward which
