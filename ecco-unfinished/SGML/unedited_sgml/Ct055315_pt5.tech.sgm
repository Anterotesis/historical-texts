<P><HI>&sect; 1.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> HAVING fini&s;hed the detail of the actions
atchieved in the European &s;eas by the naval
forces of Great-Britain within the compa&s;s of the pre&s;ent
year, we &s;hall now proceed to record the exploits of the
Briti&s;h arms within the tropicks, and particularly the ex|pedition
to Martinique and Guadaloupe, which is &s;aid to
have &s;ucceeded even beyond the expectation of the mini&s;try.
A plan had been formed for improving the &s;ucce&s;s of the
preceding year in North-America, by carrying the Briti&s;h
arms up the river St. Laurence, and be&s;ieging Quebeck,
the capital of Canada. The armament employed again&s;t
the French i&s;lands of Martinique and Guadaloupe con|&s;tituted
part of this de&s;ign, ina&s;much as the troops em|barked
on that expedition were, in ca&s;e of a mi&s;carriage at
Martinique, intended to re-enforce the Briti&s;h army in
North-America, which was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the chief
&s;eat of the war. What hope of &s;ucce&s;s the admini&s;tration
conceived from an attempt upon Martinique may be
gue&s;&s;ed from the &s;tate of that i&s;land, as it appeared in a
memorial pre&s;ented by the French King's lieutenants of its
&s;everal di&s;tricts, to the general of the French i&s;lands, in
con&s;equence of an order i&s;&s;ued in November, for holding
them in readine&s;s to march and defend the i&s;land from the
Engli&s;h, of who&s;e de&s;ign they were appri&s;ed. They re|pre&s;ented,
that the trade with the Dutch was become their
&s;ole dependence; that they could expect no &s;uccour from
Europe, by which they had been abandoned ever &s;ince the
commencement of the war: that the traders ve&s;ted with
<PB N="3" REF="6">
the privilege of trafficking among them had abu&s;ed the
intention of the general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1759.</NOTE> and, in&s;ted of being of &s;ervice
to the colony, had fixed an arbitrary price for all the pro|vi&s;ions
which they brought in, as well as for the commo|dities
which they exported; of con&s;equence, the former
was valued at as high a price as their avarice could exact,
and the latter &s;unk as low in value as their own &s;elfi&s;h
hearts could conceive: that the colony for two months had
been de&s;titute of all kinds of provi&s;ion; the commodities
of the planters lay upon their hands; and their negroes
were in danger of peri&s;hing through hunger; a circum|&s;tance
that excited the apprehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t dreadful
con&s;equences; as to &s;laves half-&s;tarved, all kinds of
bondage were equal; and people reduced to &s;uch a &s;itu|ation
were often driven to de&s;pair, &s;eeking in anarchy and
confu&s;ion a remedy from the evils by which they were
oppre&s;&s;ed: that the be&s;t provided of the inhabitants la|boured
under the want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life; and
others had not &s;o much as a grain of &s;alt in their hou&s;es:
that there was an irreparable &s;carcity of &s;laves to cultivate
their land; and the planters were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity
of killing their cattle to &s;upport the lives of tho&s;e who
remained alive; &s;o that the mills were no longer worked,
and the inhabitants con&s;umed beforehand what ought to
be re&s;erved for their &s;u&s;tenance, in ca&s;e of being blocked
up by the enemy. They de&s;ired, therefore, that the
general would &s;uppre&s;s the permi&s;&s;ions granted to particu|lar
merchants, and admit neutral ve&s;&s;els freely into their
ports, that they might trade with the coloni&s;ts unmole&s;ted
and unre&s;trained. They ob&s;erved, that the citadel of
Port-Royal &s;eemed the principal object on which the
&s;afety and defence of the country depended; as the lo&s;s of
it would be nece&s;&s;arily attended with the reduction of the
whole i&s;land: they, therefore, advi&s;ed that this fort &s;hould
be properly provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for its
&s;afety and defence; and that magazines of provi&s;ion as well
as ammunition &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in different quarters
of the i&s;land. This remon&s;trance plainly proves that the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
i&s;land was wholly unprepared to repel the meditated in|va&s;ion, and ju&s;tifies the plan adopted by the mini&s;try of
Great-Britain. The regular troops of Martinique con|&s;i&s;ted
of about twenty independent companies greatly de|fective
in point of number. The militia was compo&s;ed
of burghers and planters di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and di&s;&s;atisfied, mingled
with a parcel of wretched negro &s;laves, groaning under
the mo&s;t intolerable mi&s;ery, from whence they could have
no hope of deliverance but by a&s;peedy change of ma&s;ters;
their magazines were empty, and their fortifications out
of repair.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Such was the &s;tate of Martinique, when the in|habitants
every day expected a vi&s;it from the Briti&s;h arma|ment,
who&s;e progre&s;s we &s;hall now relate. On the
twelfth day of November, in the preceding year, Captain
Hughes &s;ailed from St. Helen's, with eight &s;ail of the line,
one frigate, four bomb-ketches, and a fleet of tran&s;ports,
having on board &s;ix regiments of infantry, and a detacl$|ment
of artillery, be&s;ides eight hundred marines di&s;tri|buted
among the &s;hips of war, this whole force being
under the command of Major-General Hop&s;on, an old
experienced officer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Major-General Barrington,
the Colonels Armiger and Haldane, the Lieutenant-Colo|nels
Trapaud and Clavering, acting in the capacity of
brigadiers. After a voyage of &s;even weeks and three days,
the fleet arrived at Barbadoes, and anchored in Ca$li&s;le|bay,
where they joined Commodore Moore, appointed by
his Maje&s;ty to command the united &s;quadrons amounting
to ten &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates and bomb-ketches.
Ten days were employed in &s;upplying the $leet with wood
and water, in waiting for the ho&s;pital &s;hip in reviews, re|embarkations,
councils of war, a&s;&s;emblies of the council
belonging to the i&s;land, in i&s;&s;uing proclamations, and
beating up for volunteers. At length, every great &s;hip
being re-enforced with $orty negroes, to be employed in
drawing the artillery; and the troops, which did not ex|ceed
&s;ive thou&s;and eight hundred men, being joined by
two hundred Highlanders, belonging to the &s;econd batta|lion
<PB N="5" REF="8">
of the regiment commanded by Lord John Murray
in North-America, who were brought as recruits from
Scotland, under convoy of the &s;hip Ludlow-ca&s;tle, the
whole armament &s;ailed from Carli&s;le-bay on the 13th day
of January: but by this time the troops, unaccu&s;tomed to a
hot climate, were con&s;iderably weakened and reduced by
$evers, diarrhoeas, the &s;curvy, and the &s;mall-pox; which
la&s;t di&s;ea&s;e had unhappily broke out among&s;t the tran&s;ports.
Next morning the &s;quadron di&s;covered the i&s;land of Mar|tinique,
which was the place of its de&s;tination. The
chief fortification of Martinique was the citadel of Port-Royal,
a regular fort, garri&s;oned by four companies that
did not exceed the number of one hundred and fifty
men, thirty-&s;ix bombardiers, eighty Swi&s;s, and fourteen
officers. One hundred barrels of beef con&s;tituted their
whole &s;tore of provi&s;ion; and they were de&s;titute of all
other nece&s;&s;aries. They were almo&s;t wholly unprovided
with water in the ci&s;terns, with &s;pare carriages for their
cannon, match, wadding, and langrage: they had but a
&s;mall &s;tock of other ammunition, and the walls were in
many parts decayed. The only preparations they had
made for receiving the Engli&s;h were &s;ome paltry en|trenchments
thrown up at St. $ierre, and a place called
Ca&s;denavires, where they imagined the de&s;cent would
probably be attempted. On the fifteenth day of the
month the Briti&s;h &s;quadron entered the great bay of Port-Royal,
&s;ome of the &s;hips being expo&s;ed to the &s;hot of a
battery erected on the i&s;le de Ranieres, a little i&s;land
about half way up the bay. At their fir&s;t appearance,
the Flori&s;&s;ant, of &s;eventy four guns, which had been &s;o
roughly handled by Captain Tyrrel, in the Buckingham,
then lying under the guns of Fort Negro, along with two
frigates, turned up under the Citadel, and came to an an|chor
in the Carenage, behind the &s;ortification. One fri|gate,
called the Ve&s;$al, under favour of the night, made
her e&s;cape through the tran&s;ports, and directed her cour&s;e
for Europe; where &s;he was taken by Captain Hood, as we have
already related. Next day three &s;hips of the line were
<PB N="6" REF="9">
ordered to attack Fort-Negro, 1759. a battery at the di&s;tance
of three miles from the Citadel, which, being mounted
with &s;even guns only, was &s;oon &s;ilenced, and immediately
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a detachment of marines and &s;ailors; who be|ing
landed in flat-bottomed boats, clambered up the rock,
and entered through the embra&s;ures with their bayonets
fixed; here, however, they met with no re&s;i&s;tance. The
enemy had abandoned the fort with precipitation. The
Briti&s;h colours were immediately hoi&s;ted, and &s;entinels of
marines po&s;ted upon the parapet. The next care was to
&s;pike and di&s;able the cannon, break the carriages, and
de&s;troy the powder which they found in the magazine: ne|verthele&s;s,
the detachment was ordered to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the battery. This &s;ervice being &s;ucce&s;sfully performed,
three &s;hips were &s;ent to reduce the other battery at Ca&s;de|navires,
which con&s;i&s;ted only of four guns, and the&s;e were
&s;oon rendered un&s;erviceable. The French troops, re-en|forced
with militia which had been detached from the
Citadel to oppo&s;ethe di&s;embarkation, perceiving the whole
Briti&s;h &s;quadron, and all the tran&s;ports, already within
the bay, and Fort-Negro occupied by the marines, retired
to Port-Royal, leaving the beach open; &s;o that the Eng|li&s;h
troops were landed without oppo&s;ition, and, being
formed, advanced into the country towards Fort Negro,
in the neighbourhood of which they lay all night upon
their arms; while the $leet, which had been galled by bomb-&s;hells
from the Citadel, &s;hifted their &s;tation, and &s;tood far|ther
up the bay. By ten next day the Engli&s;h officers had
brought up &s;ome field-pieces to an eminence, and &s;cour|ed
the woods, from whence the troops had been greatly
annoyed by the &s;mall &s;hot of the enemy during the be&s;t
part of the night, and all that morning. At noon the Bri|ti&s;h
forces advanced in order towards the hill that over|looked
the town and citadel of Port-Royal, and &s;u&s;tained
a trouble&s;ome fire from enemies they could not &s;ee; for the
French militia were entirely covered by the woods and
bu&s;hes. This eminence, called the Morne Tortue&s;on,
though the mo&s;t important po&s;t of the whole i&s;land, was
<PB N="7" REF="10">
neglected by the general of Martinique, who had re&s;olved
to blow up the fortifications of the Citadel: but, luckily
for the i&s;landers, he had not prepared the materials for this
operation, which mu&s;t have been attended with the imme|diate
de&s;truction of the capital, and indeed of the whole
country. Some of the inferior officers, knowing the im|portance
of the Morne Tortue&s;on, re&s;olved to defend that
po&s;t with a body of the militia, which was re-enforced by
the garri&s;orts of Fort-Negro and Ca&s;denavires, as well as by
&s;ome &s;oldiers detached from the Flori&s;&s;ant: but, notwith|&s;tanding
all their endeavours, as they were entirely un|provided
with cannon, extremely defective in point of di&s;|cipline,
di&s;pirited by the pu&s;illanimity of their governour,
and in a great mea&s;ure di&s;concerted by the general con&s;ter|nation
that prevailed among the inhabitants, in all proba|bility
they could not have with&s;tood a &s;pirited and well-conducted
attack by regular forces. About two o'clock
General Hop&s;on thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from his attempt.
He gave the Commodore to under&s;tand that he could not
maintain his ground, unle&s;s the &s;quadron would &s;upply him
with heavy cannon, landed near the town of Port-Royal,
at a &s;avannah, where the boats mu&s;t have been greatly ex|po&s;ed
to the fire of the enemy, or a&s;&s;i&s;t him in attacking the
Citadel by &s;ea, while he &s;hould make his approaches by
land. Both the&s;e expedients<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Commodore offered to land the cannon on the other &s;ide of Point-Negro, at a place equally near the road from the Engli&s;h at my to Port-Royal, and even cau&s;e them to be drawn up by the &s;eamen, without giving the troops the lea&s;t trouble. But this offer was not accepted. General Hop&s;on after|wards declared, that he did not under&s;tand Mr. Moore's me&s;&s;age in the &s;en&s;e which it was meant to imply.</NOTE> being deemed impracticable
by a council of war, the troops were recalled from their
advanced po&s;ts, and re-embarked in the evening, without
any con&s;iderable mole&s;tation from the enemy. Their at|tempt
on the Morne Tortue&s;on had co&s;t them &s;everal men,
including two officers, killed or wounded in the attack;
and in revenge for this lo&s;s, they burned the &s;ugar-canes,
and de&s;olated the country in their retreat. The inha|bitants
of Martinique could hardly credit the te&s;timony of
their own &s;en&s;es, when they &s;aw them&s;elves thus delivered
<PB N="8" REF="11">
from all their fears, at a time when they were overwhelme$
with terrour and confu&s;ion; when the principal individuals
among them had re&s;igned all thought of further re&s;i&s;tanc$$
and were actually a&s;&s;embled at the publick hall in Port-Royal,
to &s;end deputies to the Engli&s;h general, with pro|po&s;als
of capitulation and &s;urrender.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The majority of the Briti&s;h officers, who con&s;ti|tuted
a council of wa$ held for this purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Commodore did not attend at this $$uncil: it was convoked to de|liberate upon the opinion of the chief engineer, who thought they &s;hould make and $span$ to the $span$ of the Carenage. In this ca&s;e, the pilots declared it would be extremely $word$, if not impracticable, for the $leet to keep up a communication with the army.</NOTE>, having given
their opinion, that it might be for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice to
make an attack upon St. Pierre, the $leet proceeded to that
part of the i&s;land, and entered the bay on the ninetcenth.
The Commodore told the General, that he made no
doubt of being able to reduce the town of St. Pierre, but
as the &s;hips might be di&s;abled in the attack, $word$ as not to be
in a condition $span$ dimmediately on any $word$ &s;ervice;
as the troops might be reduced in their $word$ &s;o as to be
incapable of future attacks; and as the reduction of the
i&s;land of Gaudaloupe would $e of great benefit to the &s;ugar
colonies, Mr. Moore propo&s;ed th$$ the armament &s;hould
immediately proceed to that i&s;land$ and the General
agreed to the propo&s;a$. The rea&s;ons produced on this oc|ca&s;ion
are, we apprehend, &s;uch as may be urged again&s;t
every operation of war. Certain it is, no conque&s;t can be
attempted, either by &s;ea or land, without expo&s;ing the
&s;hips and troops to a po&s;&s;ibility of being di&s;$$$ed and di|mini&s;hed;
and the &s;ame po&s;&s;ibility militated as &s;trongly
again&s;t an attempt upon Guadaloupe, as it could po&s;&s;ible
di&s;courage the attack of st. Pierre. Be&s;ides, Martinique
was an object of greater importan$$<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Only a$ being the &s;eat of government: for Guadaloupe makes a much greater quantity of &s;ugar, and equipped a much greater number of privateers, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Du$ch of St. $u&s;tatia, &s;ituated in its neighbourhood.</NOTE> than Guadaloupe;
as being the principal place po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French in
tho&s;e &s;eas, and that to which the operations of the arma|ment
were expre&s;sly limited by the in$tructions received from
the mini&s;try. St. Pierre was a place of con&s;iderable com|merce;
<PB N="9" REF="12">
and at that very juncture above forty &s;ail of mer|chant-&s;hips
lay at anchor in the bay. The town was de|fended
by a citadel regularly fortified, but at that time
poorly garri&s;oned; and &s;o &s;ituated as to be acce&s;&s;ible to
the &s;ire of the whole &s;quadron: for the &s;hore was bold,
and the water &s;ufficient to float any &s;hip of the line. Be|fore
the re&s;olution of proceeding of Guadaloupe was taken,
the Commodore $ad ordered the bay to be $ounded, and
directed he $$ippon to advance, and &s;ilence a battery
&s;ituated a mile and a half to the northward of St. Pierre.
Accordingly, Captain J$ky$, who commanded that &s;hip,
&s;tood in, and anchoring clo&s;e to the $hore, attacked it with
&s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that in a few minutes it was abandoned.
At the &s;ame time the Rippon was expo&s;ed to the fire of
three other batteries, from which &s;he received con&s;iderable
damage both in her hull and rigging; and was in great
danger of running a-ground, when orders were given to
tow her out of danger.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The whole armament having abandoned the
de&s;ign on Martinique, directed their cour&s;e to Guadaloupe,
another of the $word$ i&s;lands, lying at the di&s;tance of
thirty $word$ to the we&s;tward, about fifteen leagues in
length, and $word$ in breadth; divided into two parts by a
&s;mall channel, within the inhabitants cro&s;s in a ferry-boat.
The we&s;tern divi&s;ion is know by the name of Ba&s;&s;eterre;
and here the metropolis &s;tands defended by the citadel,
and other sortifications. The ea&s;tern part, called Grand|terre,
is de&s;itute of fre&s;h water, which abounds in the
other divi&s;ion, and is defended by Fort-Louis, with a re|doubt,
which commands the road in the di&s;trict of Go&s;ier.
The g$t, or canal, that &s;eparates the two parts is di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by the appellation of the Salt River, having a
road or bay at each end; namely, the $word$ Cul de Sac,
and the &s;mall Cul de Sac. Guada&s;oupe is in$umbered with
high mountains and precipices, to which the inhabitants
u&s;ed to convey their valuable effects in time of danger: but
here are al&s;o beautiful plains watered by brooks and rivers,
which fertili&s;e the &s;oil, enabling it to produce a great
<PB N="10" REF="13">
quantity of &s;ugar, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and ca&s;&s;ia;
be&s;ides plenty of rice, potatoes, all kinds of pul&s;e, and fruit
peculiar to the i&s;land. The country is populous and flou|ri&s;hing,
and the government comprehends two &s;maller
i&s;lands, called All-Saints, and De&s;eada, which appear at a
&s;mall di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the
i&s;land. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron having arrived at Ba&s;&s;eterre,
it was re&s;olved to make a general attack by &s;ea upon the
citadel, the town, and other batteries by which it was de|fended.
A di&s;po&s;ition being made for this purpo&s;e, the
large &s;hips took their re&s;pective &s;tations next morning,
which was the twenty-third day of January. At nine,
the Lion, commanded by Captain Trelawney, began the
engagement again&s;t a battery of nine guns; and the re&s;t
of the fleet continued to place them&s;elves a-brea&s;t of the
other batteries and the citadel, which mounted forty-&s;ix
cannon, be&s;ides two mortars. The action in a little time
became general, and was maintained on both &s;ides for &s;e|veral
hours with great vivacity, while the Commodore,
who had &s;hifted his pendant into the Woolwich frigate,
kept aloof without gun-&s;hot, that he might be the more
di&s;engaged to view the &s;tate of the battle,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He &s;hifted his broad pendant on board the Wool wich, as well to $word$ and keep the tran&s;ports together in a proper po&s;ture for the landing of the $$oops, as to cover the $i&s;embar$ation, and al&s;o to con&s;ult proper mea&s;ures with the general, who &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of Mr. Moore's being with him; and reque&s;ted that he, with the other general officers and engineers, might be ad|mitted on board the Woolwich, in order to con&s;ult, and take the earlie&s;t op|portunity of landing the troops, as the &s;ervice nece&s;&s;arily required.</NOTE>, and give his
orders with the greater deliberation. This expedient of
an admiral's removing his &s;lag, and retiring from the action
while his own &s;hip is engaged, however con&s;onant to
rea&s;on, we do not remember to have &s;een practi&s;ed upon
any other occa&s;ion, except in one in&s;tance at Carthagena,
where Sir Chaloner Ogle quitted his own &s;hip, when &s;he
was ordered to &s;tand in, and cannonade the fort of Boca-Chica.
In this pre&s;ent attack, all the &s;ea commanders be|haved
with extraordinary &s;pirit and re&s;olution, particularly
the Captains Le&s;lie, Burnet, Gayton, Jekyll, Trelawney,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
and Shuldam; who, in the hotte&s;t tumult of the action,
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves equally by their courage, impe|tuo&s;ity
and deliberation. About &s;ive in the afternoon
the fire of the citadel &s;lackened. The Burford and Ber|wick
were driven out to &s;ea; &s;o that Captain Shuldam, in
the Panther, was un&s;u&s;tained; and two batteries played
upon the Rippon, Captain Jekyll, who, by two in the af|ternoon,
&s;ilenced the guns of one, called the Morne-rouge;
but at the &s;ame time could not prevent his &s;hip from run|ning
a-ground. The enemy perceiving her di&s;a&s;ter, a&s;&s;em|bled
in great numbers on the hill, and lined the trenches,
from whence they poured in a &s;evere fire of mu&s;quetry.
The militia afterwards brought up a cannon of eighteen
pound ball, and for two hours raked her fore and aft with
con&s;iderable effect: neverthele&s;s, Captain Jekyll returned
the fire with equal courage and per&s;everance, though his
people dropped on every &s;ide, until all his grape &s;hot and
wadding was expended, and all his rigging cut to pieces;
to crown his misfortune, a box, containing nine hundred
cartridges, blew up on the poop, and &s;et the &s;hip on fire;
which, however, was &s;oon extingui&s;hed. In the mean
time, the Captain threw out a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In all probability it was not perceived by the Commod$te.</NOTE>; to which
no regard was paid, till Captain Le&s;tie, of the Bri&s;tol, com|ing
from &s;ea, and ob&s;erving his &s;ituation, ran in between
the Rippon and the battery; and engaged with &s;uch im|petuo&s;ity,
as made an immediate diver&s;ion in favour of
Captain Jekyll, who&s;e &s;hip remained a-ground, notwith|&s;tanding
all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be given, till mid|night,
when &s;he $loa$ed, and e&s;caped from the very jaws of
de&s;truction. At &s;even in the evening, all the other large
&s;hips having &s;ilenced the guns to which they had been re|&s;pectively
oppo&s;ed, joined the re&s;t of the fleet. The
four bombs being anchored near the &s;hore, began to ply the
town with &s;hells and carca&s;&s;es; &s;o that in a little time the
hou&s;es were in flames, the magazines of gunpowder blew
up with the mo&s;t terrible explo&s;ion; and about ten o'clock
the whole place blazed out in one general con&s;lagration.
<PB N="12" REF="15">
Next day, at two in the afternoon, the fleet came to an
anchor in the road of Ba&s;&s;eterre, when they found the
hulls of divers &s;hips which the enemy had &s;et on fire at
their approach: &s;everal &s;hips turned out, and endeavoured
to e&s;cape, but were intercepted and taken by the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron. At five the troops landed without oppo&s;ition,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town and citadel, which they
found entirely abandoned. They learned from a Genoe&s;e
de&s;erter, that the regular troops of the i&s;land con&s;i&s;ted of
five companies only, the number of the whole not exceed|ing
one hundred men; and that they had laid a train to
blow up the powder magazine in the citadel: but had been
obliged to retreat with &s;uch precipitation, as did not per|mit
them to execute this de&s;ign. The train was imme|diately
cut off, and the magazine &s;ecured. The nails
with which they have &s;piked up their cannon were drilled
out by the matro&s;&s;es; and in the mean time the Briti&s;h
colours were hoi&s;ted on the parapet. Part of the troops
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous po&s;t on an eminenc$,
and part entered the town, which &s;till continued burning
with great violence. In the morning, at day-break, the
enemy appeared, to the number of two thou&s;and, about
four miies from the town, as if they intended to throw up
entrenchments in the neighbourhood of a hou&s;e where the
governor had $ixed his head-quarters, declaring he would
maintain his ground to the la&s;t extremity. To this re&s;o|lution,
indeed, he was encouraged by the nature of the
ground, and the neighbourhood of a pa&s;s called the $word$
d'Ane, a cleft through a mountainous ridge, opening a
communication with Cape&s;terre, a more level and beautiful
part of the i&s;land. The a&s;cent from Ba&s;&s;eterre to th$$
pa&s;s was &s;o very &s;$eep, and the way &s;o broken and inter|rupted
by rocks and gullies, that there was no pro&s;$$$
of attacking it with &s;ucce&s;s, except at the fir&s;t landing, when the inhabitants were under the dominion of a pani$$$.
They very &s;oon recovered their &s;pirits and recollection,
a&s;&s;embled and fortified them&s;elves among the hills, armed
and arrayed their negroes, and affected to hold the invaders
<PB N="13" REF="16">
at de$iance. A flag of truce being &s;ent, with offers of terms,
to their governor, the Chevalier d'Etreil, he rejected
them in a letter, with which his &s;ub&s;equent conduct but
ill agreed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The letter was to this effect:
<HI>To their Excellencies Me&s;&s;. Hop$en and M$$re, General Officers of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, at Ba&s;&s;$$$$re.</HI> &startq;Gentlemen, I Have received the letter which your Excellencies have done me the ho|nour to write, &endq;of the twenty-fifth. You make me propo&s;als which could ari&s;e from nothing but the facility with which you have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the little town and citadel of Ba&s;&s;e$erre; for otherwi&s;e you ought to do me the ju&s;tice to believe they could no$ be received.

Should we be di&s;appointed in this particular, we $ave a ma&s;ter power ful enough to revenge any injury we &s;u&s;tain. I am, with re&s;pect, &startq;Gentlemen, Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, NADAU D'$TRIIL.&endq; It is pretty remarkable, that the apprehen&s;ion of $word$ u&s;age from the Eng|li&s;h, who are undoubtedly the mo&s;t $word$ and humane enemies under the fun, not only prevailed among the common French $span$ there$out this whole war, but even infected, officer of di&s;tinction, who $span$ to have been exempted from the&s;e prejudicer, by a better acquaintance with life, and a more libe$ral turn of thinking.</NOTE> Indeed, from the beginning, his deportment
had been &s;uch as gave a very unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of
his character. When the Briti&s;h &s;quadron advanced to
the attack, in&s;tead of vi&s;iting in per&s;on the citadel and the
batteries, in order to encourage and animate his people by
his exhortation and example, he retired out of the reach
of danger to a di&s;tant plantation, where he remained a
tame &s;pectator of the de&s;truction in which his principal
town and citadel were involved. Next morning, when he
ought to have exerted him&s;elf in preventing the di&s;em|barkation
of the Engli&s;h troops, who had a difficult &s;hore
and violent &s;urf to &s;urmount, and when he might have
defended the entrenchments and lines which had been
made to oppo&s;e their landing; he abandoned all the&s;e ad|vantages,
and took &s;helter among the mountains that were
deemed inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&sect; V. But, how&s;oever deficient the governor might have
been in the article of courage, certain it is the inhabitants
<PB N="14" REF="17">
behaved with great &s;pirit and activity in defence of their
country. They continually hara&s;&s;ed the &s;couring de|tachments,
by firing upon them from woods and &s;ugar
plantations, which la&s;t the Engli&s;h burned about their
ears in re&s;entment. Their armed negroes were very ex|pert
in this kind of bu&s;h-fighting. The natives or militi
appeared in con&s;iderable parties, and even encountere$
detached bodies of the Briti&s;h army. A lady of ma&s;culin$
courage, who&s;e name was Ducharmey, having armed her
&s;laves, they made &s;everal bold attempts upon an advanced
po&s;t, occupied by Major Melville, and threw up entrench|ments
upon a hill oppo&s;ite to the &s;tation of this officer&punc;
who had all along &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his uncommon in|terpidity,
vigilance and conduct. At length the work$
of this virago were &s;tormed by a regular detachment
which, after an ob&s;tinate and dangerous conflict, entere$
the entrenchment &s;word in hand, and burned the hou&s;e
and plantations. Some of the enemy were killed, and a
great number taken. Of the Engli&s;h detachment twelve
&s;oldiers were &s;lain, and thirty wounded, including thre$
&s;ubaltern officers, one of whom lo&s;t his arm. The greate$$
body of the enemy always appeared at the governour$
head-quarters, where they had rai&s;ed a redoubt, and throw$
up entrenchments. From the&s;e a con&s;iderable detachmen$
advanced on the &s;ixth day of February, in the morning
towards the citadel, and $ell in with an Engli&s;h party
whom they engaged w$$h great vivacity; but, after
&s;hort though warm di&s;pute. They were obliged to $word$
with &s;ome lo&s;s. Without all doubt the inhabitants $word$

the army and the navy were invaded with fevers and other
di&s;ea&s;es, epidemical in tho&s;e hot countries; and the regi|mental
ho&s;pitals were &s;o crowded, that it was judged con|venient
to &s;end five hundred &s;ick men to the i&s;land of An|tigua,
where they might be properly attended.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. In the mean time, the reduction of the i&s;landers
on the &s;ide of Guadaloupe appearing more and more im|practicable,
the General re&s;olved to transfer the &s;eat of
war to the ea&s;tern and more fertile part of the i&s;land, called
Grand-terre, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, was de|fended
by a &s;trong battery, called Fort-Louis. In pur&s;u|ance
of this determination, the great &s;hips were &s;ent round to
Grand-terre, in order to reduce this fortification, which
they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of Febru|ary.
After a &s;evere cannonading, which la&s;ted &s;ix hours,
a body of marines being landed, with the Highlanders<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A re-enforcement of two or three hundred $ighlanders had joined the $word$ immediately before the troops landed on Guadaloupe.</NOTE>,
they drove the enemy from their entrenchments &s;word
in hand, and, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, hoi&s;ted the
Engli&s;h colours. In a few days after this exploit, Ge|neral
Hop&s;on dying at Ba&s;&s;eterre, the chief command de|volved
on General Barrington, who re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute
the final reduction of the i&s;land with vigour and di&s;patch.
As one &s;tep towards this conque&s;t, the Commodore or|dered
two &s;hips of war to crui&s;e off the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;ta|tia,
and prevent the Dutch traders from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the na|tives
of Guadaloupe, whom they had hitherto con&s;tantly
&s;upplied with provi&s;ions, &s;ince they retired to the moun|tains.
General Barrington, on the very fir&s;t day of his
command, ordered the troops who were encamped to
&s;trike their tents and huts, that the enemy might imagine
he intended to remain in this quarter; but in a few days
the batteries in and about Ba&s;&s;e-terre were blown up and
de&s;troyed, the detachments recalled from the advanced
po&s;ts, and the whole army re-embarked, except one regi|ment
with a detachment of artillery, left in garri&s;on
at the citadel, the command of which was be&s;towed on
<PB N="16" REF="19">
Colonel Debri&s;ay, an accompli&s;hed officer of great expe|rience.
The enemy no &s;ooner perceived the coa&s;t clear
than they de&s;cended from the hills, and endeavoured to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, from which however they
were driven by the fire of the Citadel. They afterward$
erected a battery, from whence they annoyed this forti|fication
both with &s;hot and &s;hells, and even threatened a
regular attack; but, as often as they approached the place,
they were repul&s;ed by &s;allies from the ca&s;tle<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The battery which they had rai&s;ed was attacked at noon, taken, $word$ de&s;troyed by Captain Blome$, of the &s;ixty fir&s;t regiment.</NOTE>. In the
mid&s;t of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, the gallant Debri&s;ay, together
with Major Trollop, one lieutenant, two bombardiers,
and &s;everal common &s;oldiers, were blown up, and peri&s;hed,
by the explo&s;ion of a powder-magazine at the &s;lanked an|gle
of the &s;outh-ea&s;t ba&s;tion. The confu&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily
produced by &s;uch an unfortunate accident encouraged the
enemy to come pouring down from the hills, in order to
make their advantage of the di&s;a&s;ter; but they were &s;oon
repul&s;ed by the fire of the garri&s;on. The General, being
made acquainted with the $ate of Colonel Debri&s;ay, con|ferred
the government of the fort upon Major Melvil, and
&s;ent thither the chief engineer to repair and improve the
fortifications.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. In the mean time, Commodore Moore having re|ceived
certain intelligence that Mon&s;. de Bompart had arri|ved
at Martinique, with a &s;quad$on, con&s;i&s;ting of eight $ail of
the line and three frigates, having on board a whole battalion
of Swi&s;s, and &s;ome other troops, to re-enforce the g$rri&s;o$$
of the i&s;land, he called in his crui&s;ers, and failed imme|diately
to the bay of Dominique, an i&s;land to wind|ward,
at the di&s;tance of nine leagues from Guadaloupe,
whence he could always $ail to oppo&s;e any de&s;igns which
the French commander might form again&s;t the operations
of the Briti&s;h armaments. For what rea&s;on Mr. Moore
did not fail immediately to the bay of Port Royal in Mar|tinique,
where he knew the French &s;quadron lay at $$|chor,
we &s;hall not pretend to determine. Had he taken
<PB N="17" REF="20">
that &s;tep, M. Bompart mu&s;t either have given him battle,
or retired into the Carenage, behind the Citadel; in which
la&s;t ca&s;e, the Engli&s;h commander might have anchored be|tween
Pigeon-i&s;land and Fort-Negro, and thus blocked
him up effectually. By retiring to Dominique, he left
the &s;ea open to French privateers, who roved along the
coa&s;ts of the&s;e i&s;lands, and in a very little time carrie into
Martinique above four&s;core merchant-&s;hips belonging to
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. The&s;e continual depreda|tions,
committed under the no&s;e of the Engli&s;h commo|dore,
irritated the planters of the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, &s;ome
of whom are &s;aid to have circulated unfavourable re|ports
of that gentleman's character<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by the Commodore for his conduct in this parti|cular are the&s;e:&mdash;The bay of Dominique was the only place in which he could tendezvous and unite his &s;quadron. Here he refre&s;hed his men, who were grown &s;ickly in con&s;equence of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on &s;alt provi&s;ion. Here h$ &s;up|plied his &s;hips with plenty of fre&s;h water. Here he had intercour&s;e once or twice every day with General Barrington, by means of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els which pa&s;&s;ed $word$ repa&s;&s;ed from one i&s;land to the other. By remaining in this &s;itua|tion, he likewi&s;e maintained a communication with the Engli&s;h Leeward I&s;lands, which being in a defencele&s;s condition, their inhabitants were con|&s;tantly &s;olliciting the commodore's protection; and here he &s;upported the army, the commander of which was unwilling that be &s;hould remove to a greater di&s;tance. Had he &s;ailed to Port-Royal, he would have $ound the enemy's &s;quadiron &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that he could not have attacked them, unle&s;s M. de Bompart had been inclined to hazard an action. Had he anchored in the $ay, all his crui$er$ mu&s;t have been employed in conveying provi&s;ions and &s;tores to the &s;quadron. There he could not have procu$ed either fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions or water; nor could he have had any communication with, nor intel|ligence from, the army in the Leeward I&s;lands, in Ie&s;s than eight or $word$ days.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. General Barrington, being left with no more than
one &s;hip of forty guns for the protection of the tran&s;ports,
formed a plan of pro&s;ecuting the war in Guadaloupe by
detachments, and the &s;ucce&s;s fully an&s;wered his expecta|tion.
He determined to make a de&s;cent on the divi&s;ion of
the i&s;land called Grande-terre, and for that purpo&s;e allotted
&s;ix hundred men; who, under the command of Colonel
Crump, landed between the towns of St. Anne and St.
Francois, and de&s;troyed &s;ome batteries of the enemy, from
whom he &s;u&s;tained very little oppo&s;ition. While he was thus
<PB N="18" REF="21">
employed, a detachment of three hundred men attacked
the town of Go&s;ier, which, notwith&s;anding a &s;evere fire,
they took by &s;torm, drove the garri&s;on into the woods,
&s;et fire to the place and demoli&s;hed the battery and en|trenchment
rai&s;ed for its defence. This &s;ervice being
happily performed, the detachment was ordered to force
their way to Fort-Louis, while the garri&s;on of that ca&s;tle
was directed to make two &s;all$es, in order to favour their
irruption. They accordingly penetrated with &s;ome lo&s;s
&s;u&s;tained in forcing a &s;trong pa&s;s, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
battery which the enemy had rai&s;ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h
camp, in the neighbourhood of Fort-Louis. The Gene|ral,
having hitherto &s;ucceeded in his de&s;igns, formed the
&s;cheme of &s;urpri&s;ing at one time the three towns of Petit|bourg,
Gonoyave, and St. Mary, &s;ituated on the Ba&s;&s;e-terre
&s;ide of the little Cul de Sac, and committed the exe|cution
of it to the Colonels Crump and Clavering: but the
night appointed for the &s;ervice proved exceedingly dark and
tempe&s;tuous, and the Negro conductors were &s;o frightened,
that they ran &s;everal of the flat-bottomed boats on the
&s;hoals that &s;kirt this part of the i&s;land. Colonel Clavering
landed with about eighty men: but found him&s;elf &s;o en|tangled
with mangrove trees, and the mud &s;o impa&s;&s;ably
deep, that he was obliged to re-embark, though not be|fore
the enemy had di&s;covered his de&s;ign. This project
having mi&s;carried, the general detached the &s;ame com|manders,
who&s;e gallantry and conduct cannot be &s;uffi|ciently
applauded, with a detachment of fifteen hundred
men, including one hundred and fifty volunteers from
Antigua, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnon|ville,
at the bottom of the little Cul de Sac, under the
protection of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip Woolwich. The ene|my
made no oppo&s;ition to their landing; but retreated, as
the Engli&s;h advanced, to a &s;trong entrenchment thrown
up behind the river Licorne, a po&s;t of the utmo&s;t im|portance,
as it covered the whole country as far as the bay
of Mahaut, where provi&s;ions and &s;upplies of all &s;orts were
landed from St. Eu&s;tatia. The river was rendered inac|ce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="19" REF="22">
by a mora&s;s, covered with mangroves, except at
two narrow pa&s;&s;es, which they had fortified with a redoubt,
and entrenchments well palli&s;aded, mounted with cannon,
and defended by a numerous militia: be&s;ides, the narrow
roads through which only they could be attacked were
inter&s;ected with deep and wide ditches. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e di&s;advantages, the Engli&s;h commanders determined
to hazard an a&s;&s;ault. While four field-pieces and two
howitzers maintained a con&s;tant fire upon the top of the
entrenchments, the regiment of Duroure and the High|landers
advanced under this cover, firing by platoons with
the utmo&s;t regularity. The enemy, intimidated by their
cool and re&s;olute behaviour, began to abandon the fir&s;t
entrenchments on the left. Then the Highlanders drawing
their &s;words, and &s;u&s;tained by part of the regiment, threw
them&s;elves in with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, and followed
the fugitives pell-mell into the redoubt, of which they
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but they &s;till maintained their ground
within the entrenchments on the right, from whence they
annoyed the a&s;&s;ailants both with mu&s;ketry and cannon.
In half an hour, an occa&s;ional bridge being made, the
Engli&s;h troops pa&s;&s;ed the river, in order to attack this
po&s;t, which the enemy abandoned with precipitation:
notwith&s;tanding all their ha&s;te, however, about &s;eventy
were taken pri&s;oners, and among the&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable inhabitants of the i&s;land. This advantage
co&s;t the Engli&s;h two officers and thirteen men killed, and
above fifty wounded.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The roads being mended for the pa&s;&s;age of the
artillery, the troops advanced towards Petit-bourg, har|ra&s;&s;ed
in their march by &s;lying bodies of the enemy, and
arrived late at night on the banks of the river Lizarde,
the only ford of which the French had fortified with &s;trong
entrenchments, protected by a battery of four cannon,
erected on a ri&s;ing ground in their rear. Colonel Claver|ing,
while he amu&s;ed them all night at this place by a con|&s;tant
fire into their lines, tran&s;ported in two canoes, which
he launched about a mile and a half farther down the river,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
a &s;ufficient number of troops, by day-break, to attack
them on the other &s;ide in flank, while he advanced in front
at the head of his lit$le army; but they did not think
proper to &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault. On the contrary, they no
&s;oone$ perceived his intention, than they for&s;ook the po&s;t,
and fled without order. Colonel Clavering, having pa&s;&s;ed
the river, pur&s;ued them to Petit-bourg, which they had
al&s;o fortified; and here he found Captain Uvedale, of the
Grenada bomb-ketch, throwing &s;hells into the redoubt.
He forthwith &s;ent detachments to occupy the neighbouring
heights; a circum&s;tance which the enemy no &s;ooner ob|&s;erved,
than they de&s;erted the place, and retired with great
expedition. On the fifteenth day of April Captain Steel
de&s;troyed a battery at Gonoyave, a &s;trong po&s;t, which,
though it might have been defended again&s;t an army, the
French abandoned at his approach, after having made a
ha&s;ty di&s;charge of their artillery. At the &s;ame time Colo|nel
Crump was detached with &s;even hundred men to the
bay of Mahaut, where he burned the town and batteries,
which he found abandoned, together with a va&s;t quan|tity
of provi&s;ions, which had been brought from the
i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatia. Colonel Clavering, having left a
&s;mall garri&s;on at Petit-bourg, began his march on the
twentieth day of the month towards St. Mary's, where he
under&s;tood the enemy had collected their whole force,
thrown up entrenchments, and rai&s;ed barricadoes: but they
had left their rear unguarded. The Engli&s;h commander
immediately detached Colonel Barlow, with a body of
troops, to attack them from that quarter, while he him&s;elf
advanced again&s;t the front of their entrenchment. They
&s;tood but one cannon-&s;hot, and then &s;led to their lines and
batteries at St. Mary's, the &s;lanks of which were covered
with woods and precipices. When they perceived the
Engli&s;h troops endeavouring to &s;urmount the&s;e difficul|ties,
and turn their lines, they quitted them, in order to
oppo&s;e the de&s;ign; and were immediately attacked with
&s;uch vivacity, in the face of a &s;evere fire of mu&s;ketry and
<PB N="21" REF="24">
cannon, that they abandoned their ground, and fled in the
utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, leaving the field and all their artillery
to the victors, who took up their quarters for the night
at St. Mary's. Next day, they entered the charming coun|try
of Cape&s;terre, where eight hundred and &s;eventy negroes
belonging to one planter &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. Here
Colonel Clavering was met by Me&s;&s;ieurs de Clain villiers
and Duqueruy, deputed by the principal inhabitants of
the i&s;land, to know what capitulation would be granted.
The&s;e he conducted to Petit-bourg, where they were pre|&s;ented
to General Barrington, who con&s;idering the ab|&s;ence
of the fleet, the &s;mall number of his forces, daily
dimini&s;hing, the difficulty of the country, and the po&s;&s;i|bility
of the enemy's being re-enforced from Martinique,
wi&s;ely took the advantage of their pre&s;ent panick, and
&s;ettled terms of capitulation without delay. The &s;anity
of this re&s;olution &s;oon appeared. The inhabitants had ju&s;t
&s;igned the agreement, when a me&s;&s;enger arrived in their
camp, with information, that M. de Beauharnois, the
general of the French i&s;lands, had landed at St. Anne's,
to the windward, with a re-enforcement from Martinique,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix hundred regulars from Europe, about
fifteen hundred volunteers, be&s;ides a great number of the
militia drafted from the companies of Martinique, with a
great &s;upply of arms and ammunition, mortars and artil|lery,
under convoy of the &s;quadron commanded by M. de
Bompart, who no &s;ooner learned that the capitulation was
&s;igned, than he re-embarked the troops and &s;tores with all
po&s;&s;ible expedition, and returned to Martinique. Thus we
&s;ee the conque&s;t of this important i&s;land, which is &s;aid to
produce a greater quantity of &s;ugar than is made in any of
the Engli&s;h plantations, was as much owing to accident
as to the valour of the troops and the conduct of the ge|neral:
for, had the re-enforcement arrived an hour &s;ooner
than it actually landed, in all probability the Engli&s;h
would have found it impracticable to fini&s;h the reduction
of Guadaloupe. Be that as it may, the natives certainly
de&s;erved great commendation, not only for per&s;ervering &s;o
<PB N="22" REF="25">
gallantly in defence of their country, but al&s;o for their
fortitude in bearing every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s. They now
quitted the Dos d'Ane, and all their other po&s;ts, and re|turned
to their re&s;pective habitations. The town of Ba&s;&s;e-terre
being reduced to a heap of a&s;hes, the inhabitants
began to clear away the rubbi&s;h, and erect occa&s;ional
&s;heds, where they re&s;umed their &s;everal occupations with
that good humour &s;o peculiar to the French nation; and
General Barrington humanely indulged them with all th$$
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The &s;mall i&s;lands of De&s;eada, Los Santos, and Pe|tit-terre
were compri&s;ed in the capitulation of Guadaloupe.
The inhabitants of Marigalante, which lies about three
leagues to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Grande-torre, extending
twenty miles in length, fifteen in breadth, flat and fertile,
but poorly watered and ill fortified, having refu&s;ed to &s;ub|mit
when &s;ummoned by the &s;quadron to &s;urrender, Ge|neral
Barrington re&s;olved to reduce them by force. He
embarked a body of troops on board of tran&s;ports, which
failed thither under convoy of three &s;hips of war and two
bomb-ve&s;&s;els from Prince Rupert's Bay, and at their ap|pearance
the i&s;landers $ubmitting, received an Engli&s;h
garri&s;on. Before this period, Commodore Moore having
received intelligence that M. de Bompart had &s;ailed from
Martinique, with de&s;ign to land a re-enforcement on
Guadaloupe, and that his &s;quad$on was &s;een &s;even leagues
to windward of Marigalante, he failed from Prince Ru|pert's
Bay, and turned to windward. After having been
beaten about for five days to very little purpo&s;e, he received
notice from one of his crui&s;ers, that the French admiral
had returned to Martinique; upon which information he
retired quietly to his former &s;tation in the bay of Domi|nique,
the people of which were &s;o in&s;olent as to affirm,
$n deri&s;ion, that the Engli&s;h &s;quadron &s;ailed on one &s;ide
of the i&s;land, and the French upon the other, that they
might be &s;ure of not meeting; but this, without doubt
was an impudent calumny<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Commodore declare, that be carried a $word$&s;ail night and day $word$ order to come up with the French &s;quadron, $word$ took every &s;tep that could be devi&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. He &s;ays, if he had $span$ cour&s;e, the French commander might have run into the road of St. Kit's, and de&s;troyed or taken a great number of merchant-&s;hips which were then loading with $span$ for England.

<P><PB N="23" REF="26">
&sect; XI. General Barrington, having happily fini&s;hed the
conque&s;t of Guadaloupe, gave notice to the Commodore,
that he intended to &s;end back part of the troops, with the
tran&s;ports to England, about the beginning of July. In
con&s;equence of this intimation, Mr. Moore $ailed with
his &s;quadron to Ba&s;&s;eterre road, where he was next day
joined by two &s;hips of the line from England, which ren|dered
him greatly &s;uperior in &s;trength to the commander
of the French &s;quadrons, who had retired to the i&s;land of
Grenada, lying about eight leagues from Guadaloupe. Here
he was di&s;covered by the &s;hip Rippon, who&s;e captain return|ed
immediately to Ba&s;&s;eterre, to make the commodore ac|quainted
with this circum&s;tance; but, before he could
weigh anchor, a frigate arrived, with information that
Bompart had quitted Grenada, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to have
directed his cour&s;e to Hi&s;paniola. The Commodore im|mediately
di&s;patched the Ludlow-ca&s;tle with this intelli|gence
to Admiral Coates, who commanded the &s;quadron
at Jamaica. General Barrington having made a tour of the
i&s;land, in order to vi&s;it and repair &s;uch fortifications as he
thought nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained, and the affairs relating
to the inhabitants being entirely &s;ettled, he &s;ent the High|landers,
with a body of drafts, to North America, under
convoy: he garri&s;oned the principal &s;trengths of the i&s;|land,
and left the chief command to Colonel Crump, who
had for &s;ome time acted as brigadier-general, Colonel
Clavering having been &s;ent home to England with the
account of the capitulation. Colonel Melville, who had
&s;ignalized him&s;elf in a remarkable manner ever &s;ince their
<PB N="24" REF="27">
fir&s;t landing, continued governor of the citadel at Ba&s;&s;e|terre;
and the command at Grande-terre was conferred
on Colonel Delgarno. Three complete regiments were
allotted as a &s;ufficient guard for the whole i&s;land, and the
other three were embarked for England. General Bar|rington
him&s;elf went on board the Roebuck in the latter
end of June, and took his departure for England. About
a month after, the tran&s;ports, under convoy of Captain.
Hughes, with a &s;mall &s;quadron, &s;et &s;ail for Great Britain,
while Commodore Moore, with his large fleet, directed his
cour&s;e to Antigua.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. While this armament had been employed in the
conque&s;t of Guadaloupe, North America exhibited &s;till
more &s;anguinary &s;cenes of war and deva&s;tation, which, in
order properly to introduce, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain
the &s;teps that were taken on this continent, previous to
this campaign. In October of the preceding year, a grand
a&s;&s;embly was held at Ea&s;ton, about ninety miles from Phi|ladelphia;
and there peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a formal
treaty between Great Britain and the &s;everal nations of
Indians inhabiting the country between the Apalachian
mountains and the lakes. The Twightwees, however,
&s;ettled between the river Ohio and the lakes, did not a&s;&s;i&s;t
at this treaty, though &s;ome &s;teps had been taken towards
an alliance with that people. The conferences were
managed by the governors of Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey,
accompanied by Sir William John&s;on's deputy for
Indian affairs, four members of the council at Penn&s;ylva|nia,
&s;ix members of the a&s;&s;embly, two agents for the pro|vince
of New Jer&s;ey, a great number of planters, and
citizens of Philadelphia, chiefly quakers. They were
met by the deputies and chiefs of the Mohawks, Oneidoes,
Onondagoes, Cayugas, Senecas, Tu&s;caroras, Nanticoques,
and Conoys, the Tuteloes, Chugnues, Delawares, and
Unamies, the Mini&s;inks, Mohicons, and Wappingers:
the whole number, including their women and children,
amounting to five hundred. Some of the Six Nations,
thinking them&s;elves aggrieved by the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts,
<PB N="25" REF="28">
who had impri&s;oned certain individuals of their nation,
and had killed a few, and treated others with contempt,
did not fail to expre&s;s their re&s;entment, which had been
artfully fomented by the French emi&s;&s;aries, even into an
open rupture. The Delawares and Mini&s;inks, in par|ticular,
complained that the Engli&s;h had encroached upon
their lands, and on that account were provoked to ho&s;ti|lities:
but their chief, Teedyu&s;cung, had made overtures
of peace; and, in the character of amba&s;&s;ador from all the
ten nations, had been very in&s;trumental in forming this
a&s;&s;embly. The chiefs of the Six Nations, though very
well di&s;po&s;ed to peace, took umbrage at the importance
a&s;&s;umed by one of the Delawares, over whom, as their
de&s;cendants, they exerci&s;e a kind of parental authority;
and on this occa&s;ion they made no &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e their
di&s;&s;atisfaction. The bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore, of the Engli&s;h go|vernors
at this congre&s;s was to a&s;certain the limits of
the lands in di&s;pute, reconcile the Six Nations with their
nephews, the Delawares, remove every cau&s;e of mi&s;under|&s;tanding
between the Engli&s;h and the Indians, detach the&s;e
&s;avages entirely from the French intere&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;h a firm
peace, and induce them to exert their influence in per&s;uad|ing
the Twightwees to accede to this treaty. Tho&s;e In|dians,
though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of few ideas, circum&s;cribed in their
mental faculties, &s;tupid, brutal, and ferocious, conduct
them&s;elves, neverthele&s;s, in matters of importance to the
community, by the general maxims of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice;
and their treaties are always founded upon good &s;en&s;e,
conveyed in a very ridiculous manner. Their language
is guttural, har&s;h, and poly&s;yllabical; and their &s;peech
con&s;i&s;ts of hyperbolical metaphors and &s;imilies, which in|ve&s;t
in with an air of dignity, and heig$ten the expre&s;&s;ion.
They manage their conferences by means of wampum, a
kind of bead, formed of a hard &s;hell, either in &s;ingle &s;trings, or
&s;ewed in broad belts of different dimen&s;ions, according to
the importance of the &s;ubject. Every propo&s;ition is offered,
every an&s;wer made, every promi&s;e corroborated, every de|claration
atte&s;ted, and every treaty confirmed, by producing
<PB N="26" REF="29">
and interchanging the&s;e belts of wampum. The con|ferences
were continued from the eighth to the twenty
&s;ixth day of October, when every article was &s;ettled to
the mutual &s;atisfaction of all parties. The Indian depu|ties
were gratified with a valuable pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ting of
looking-gla&s;&s;es, knives, tobacco-boxes, $leeve-buttom,
thimbles, &s;heers, gunlocks, ivory combs, &s;hirts, &s;hoc$,
&s;tockings, hats, caps, handkerchiefs, thread, clothes,
blankets, gartering, &s;erges, watch-coats, and a few &s;uits
of laced clothes for their chieftains. To crown their
happine&s;s, the &s;tores of rum were opened: they drank
them&s;elves into a &s;tate of brutalintoxication, and next day
returned in peace to their re&s;pective places of habitation</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. This treaty with the Indians, who had been
debauched from the intere&s;t of Great-Britain, au&s;pi|ciou&s;ly
paved the way for tho&s;e operations which had been
projected again&s;t the French &s;ettlements in Canada. In|&s;tead
of employing the whole &s;trength of the Briti&s;h arm$
in North-America again&s;t one object, the mini&s;try pro|po&s;ed
to divide the forces, and make impre&s;&s;ions on thre$
different parts at once, that the enemy might be divided,
di&s;tracted, and weakened, and the conque&s;t of Canad$
completed in one campaign. That the &s;ucce&s;s might be
the more certain, the different expeditions were planned
in &s;uch a manner as to co-operate with each other, and
even join occa&s;ionally; &s;o practicable was it thought for
them to maintain &s;uch a corre&s;pondence as would admit of
a junction of this nature. The project of this campaign
imported, that General Wolfe, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf &s;o eminently in the &s;iege of Loui&s;bourg, &s;hould
proceed up the river St. Laurence, as &s;oon as the navi|gation
&s;hould be clear of ice, with a body of eight thou|&s;and
men, and a con&s;iderable &s;quadron of &s;hips from
England, to undertake the &s;iege of Quebeck, the capital
of Canada: that General Amher&s;t, who commanded in
chief, &s;hould, with another army of regular troops and pro|vincials,
amounting to twelve thou&s;and men, reduc$
Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, cro&s;s the lake Champlain
<PB N="27" REF="30">
and, proceeding along the river Richelieu to the banks of
the river St. Laurence, join General Wolfe in the &s;iege of
Quebeck: that Brigadier-General Prideaux, with a third
body, re-enforced with a con&s;iderable number of friendly
Indians, a&s;&s;embled by the influence and under the com|mand
of Sir William John&s;on, &s;hould inve&s;t the French
fort erected by the fall or cataract of Niagara, which
was certainly the mo&s;t important po&s;t of all French Ame|rica&punc;
as it in a manner commanded all the interior parts of
that va&s;t continent. It overawed the whole country of
the Six Nations, who were cajoled into a tame acquie&s;|cence
in its being built on their territory: it &s;ecured all the
inland trade, the navigation of the great lakes, the com|munication
between Canada and Loui&s;iana, and opened a
pa&s;&s;age for inroads into the colonies of Great-Britain. It
was propo&s;ed, that the Briti&s;h forces, having reduced
Niagara, &s;hould be embarked on the lake Ontario, fall
down the river St. Laurence, be&s;iege and take Montreal,
and then join or co-operate with Amher&s;t's army. Be|&s;ide
the&s;e larger armaments, Colonel Stanwix commanded
a &s;maller detachment for reducing &s;maller forts, and &s;cour|ing
the banks of the lake Ontario. How far this project
was founded on rea&s;on and military knowledge may be
judged by the following particulars, of which the pro|jectors
were not ignorant. The navigation of the river
St. Laurence is dangerous and uncertain. The city of
Quebeck was remarkably &s;trong from &s;ituation and forti|fication,
from the bravery of the inhabitants, and the
number of the garri&s;on. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm, an
officer of great courage and activity, kept the field between
Montreal and Quebeck, with a body of eight or ten thou|&s;and
men, con&s;i&s;ting of regular troops and di&s;ciplined
militia, re-enforced by a con&s;iderable number of armed
Indians; and another body of re&s;erve hovered in the neigh|bourhood
of Montreal, which was the re&s;idence of Mon|&s;ieur
de Vaudreuil, governor general of Canada. The
garri&s;on of Niagara con&s;i&s;ted of above &s;ix hundred men;
the march to it was tedious and emibarra&s;&s;ed; and Mon|&s;ieur
<PB N="28" REF="31">
de Levi &s;coured the country with a flying detachment, well acquainted with all the woods and pa&s;&s;es. With
re&s;pect to General Amher&s;t's &s;hare of the plan, the forts
of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point &s;tood in his way. The
enemy were ma&s;ters of the lake Champlain, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the &s;trong fort of Chambly, by the fall of the river Riche|lieu,
which defended the pa&s;s to the river St. Laurence.
Even had the&s;e ob&s;tacles been removed, it was hardly
po&s;&s;ible that he and Mr. Wolfe &s;hould arrive at Quebeck
in the &s;ame in&s;tant of time. The fir&s;t that reached it,
far from being in a condition to undertake the &s;iege of
Quebeck, would have run the ri&s;k of being engaged and
defeated by the covering army; in which ca&s;e, the other
body mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent hazard
of de&s;truction, in the mid&s;t of an enemy's country, far
di&s;tant from any place of &s;afety to which it could retreat.
Had the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters happened, and, according to the ex|perience
of war, they were the natural con&s;equences of the
&s;cheme, the troops at Niagara would in all probability
have fallen an ea&s;y &s;acrifice, unle&s;s they had been &s;o fortu|nate
as to receive intelligence time enough to accompli&s;h
their retreat before they could be intercepted. The de&s;ign
would, we apprehend, have been more ju&s;tifiable, or at
lea&s;t not &s;o liable to objection, had Mr. Amher&s;t left two
or three regiments to protect the frontiers of New-York,
and joining Mr. Wolfe with the re&s;t, failed up the river
St. Laurence to be&s;iege Quebeck. Even in that ca&s;e, the
whole number of his troops would not have been &s;ufficient,
according to the practice of war, to inve&s;t the place and
cope with the covering $nemy. Neverthele&s;s had the en|terpri&s;e
&s;ucceeded, Montcalm mu&s;t either have hazarded
an engagement again&s;t great odds, or retired farther into
the country: then the route would have been open by land
and water to Montreal, which could have made little re|&s;i&s;tance.
The two principal towns being taken, and the
navigation of the St. Laurence blocked up, all the depen|dant
$orts mu&s;t have &s;urrendered $word$ di&s;cretion, except
Niagara, which there was a bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upplying,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
at an incredible trouble and expen&s;e, from the di&s;tant
Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; but, even then, it might have been be&s;ieged
in form, and ea&s;ily reduced. Whatever defects there might
have been in the plan, the execution, though it mi&s;carried
in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential points, was attended with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s.
The &s;ame good fortune that pro&s;pered the Briti&s;h
arms &s;o remarkably in the conque&s;t of Guadaloupe &s;eem|ed
to interpo&s;e &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hingly in their favour at
Quebeck, the &s;iege of which we &s;hall record in its proper
place. At pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t attend the operations of Ge|neral
Amher&s;t, who&s;e &s;eparate army was fir&s;t in motion,
though &s;uch impediments were thrown in his way as
greatly retarded the progre&s;s of his operations: impedi|ments
&s;aid to have ari&s;en from the pride, in&s;olence, and
ob&s;tinacy of certain individuals, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great influ|ence
in that part of the world, and employed it all to
thwart the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The &s;ummer was already far advanced before
General Amher&s;t could pa&s;s lake George with his forces,
although they met with no oppo&s;ition, and reach the
neighbourhood of Ticonderoga, where, in the preceding
year, the Briti&s;h troops had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a terrible di&s;|a&s;ter.
At fir&s;t the enemy &s;eemed determined to defend
this fortre&s;s: but perceiving the Engli&s;h commander re&s;o|lute,
cautious, and well prepared for undertaking the &s;iege;
having, moreover, orders to retreat from place to place,
towards the centre of operations at Quebeck, rather than
run the lea&s;t ri&s;k of being made pri&s;oners of war; they in
the night of July the twenty-&s;eventh abandoned the po&s;t,
after having in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;mantled the fortifications,
and retired to Crown Point, a fort &s;ituated on the verge
of lake Champlain. General Amher&s;t, having taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this important po&s;t, which effectually covered
the frontiers of New-York, and &s;ecured to him&s;elf a &s;afe
retreat in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, ordered the works to be repair|ed,
and allotted a &s;trong garri&s;on for its defence. This
acqui&s;ition, however, was not made without the lo&s;s of a
brave accompli&s;hed young officer, Colonel Roger Town|&s;hend,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
who, in reconnoitring the fort, was killed with$
cannon-&s;hot, and fell near the &s;ame &s;pot which in the
former year had been enriched with the blood of the gal|lant
Lord Howe, whom he &s;trongly re&s;embled in the cir|cum&s;tances
of birth, age, qualifications, and character</P>
<P>&sect; XV. While the General &s;uperintended the repairs $word$
Ticonderoga, and the men were employed in preparing
batteaux and other ve&s;&s;els, his &s;couting parties hovered $word$
the neighbourhood of Crown-Point, in order to watch the
motions of the enemy. From one of the&s;e detachment
he received intelligence, on the fir&s;tday of Augu&s;t, that th$
enemy had retired from Crown-Point. He immediatel$
detached a body of rangers before him, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io$
of the place: then he embarked with the re&s;t of the army
and on the fourth day of the month landed at the &s;o$$
where the troops were immediately encamped. His ne$
care was to lay the foundation of a new fort, to be main|tained
for the further &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h dominions $word$
that part of the country, and particularly for prevent $word$
the inroads of &s;calping parties, by whom the plantatio$
had been dreadfully infe&s;ted. Here information was r$|ceived
that the enemy had retired to the I&s;le aux N$i$
at the other end of the lake Champlain, five leagues $word$
the hither &s;ide of St. John's; that their force encamped $word$
that place, under the command of M. de Burlemaque
con&s;i&s;ted of three battalions and five piquets of regul$
troops, with Canadians and marines, amounting in th$
whole to three thou&s;and five hundred effective men, pro|vided
with a numerous train of artillery; and that th$
lake was occupied by four large ve&s;&s;els mounted with ca$|non,
and manned with piquets of different regimen$
under the command and direction of M. le Bras, a capta$$
in the French navy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by M. de Rigal and other &s;$$
officers. In con&s;equence of this intimation, General A$|her&s;t,
who had for &s;ome time employed Captain Lori$
to &s;uperinted the building of ve&s;&s;els at Ticonderoga, be$$
re&s;olved to have the &s;uperiority on the lake, directed the cap|tain
to build with all po&s;&s;ible expedition a &s;loop of &s;ixteen
<PB N="31" REF="34">
guns, and a radeau eighty-four feet in length, capa|ble
of carrying &s;ix large cannon. The&s;e, together with a
brigantine, being fini&s;hed, victualled and manned by the
eleventh day of October, the General embarked with the
whole of the troops in batteaux, in order to attack the
enemy; but next day, the weather growing tempe&s;tuous,
was obliged to take &s;helter in a bay on the we&s;tern &s;hore,
where the men were landed for refre&s;hment. In the mean
time, Captain $o$ing, with his &s;mall &s;quadron, failed down
the lake, gave cha&s;e to a French &s;chooner, and drove three
of their &s;hips into a bay, where two of them were &s;unk,
and the third run a-ground by their own crew, who e&s;|caped:
one, however, was repaired and brought away by
Captain Loring, &s;o that now the French had but one
&s;chooner remaining. General Amher&s;t, after having been
&s;ome days wind-bound, re-embarked his forces, and pro|ceeded
down the lake; but the &s;torm, which had abated,
beginning to blow with redoubled fury, &s;o as to &s;well the
waves mountain high, the &s;ea&s;on for action being elap&s;ed,
and winter &s;etting in with the mo&s;t rigorous &s;everity, he
&s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign, and was
obliged to de&s;i&s;t. Returning to the &s;ame bay where he
had been &s;heltered, he landed the troops, and began his
march for Crown-point, where he arrived on the twenty-fir&s;t
day of October. Having &s;ecured a &s;uperiority on the
lake, he now employed all his attention in rearing the
new fortre&s;s at Crown-Point, together with three &s;mall
out-forts for its better defence; in opening roads of com|munication
with Ticonderoga, and the governments of
Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's and New Hamp&s;hire; and in making di&s;po|&s;itions
for the winter-quarters of his troops, &s;o as to pro|tect
the country from the inroads of the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. During the whole &s;ummer he received not the
lea&s;t intelligence of Mr. Wolfe's operations, except a few
hints in &s;ome letters relating to the exchange of pri&s;oners,
that came from the French general, Montcalm, who gave
him to under&s;tand, that Mr. Wolfe had landed in the
neighbourhood of Quebeck, and &s;eemed determined to
<PB N="32" REF="35">
undertake the &s;iege of that city; that he had honoured him
(the French general) with &s;everal notes, &s;ometimes couched
in a &s;oothing &s;train, &s;ometimes filled with threats that the
French army intended to give him battle, and a few days
would determine the fate of Quebeck. Though Mr. Am|her&s;t
was ignorant of the proceedings of the Quebeck &s;qua|dron,
his communication continued open with the forces
which undertook the &s;iege of Niagara; and he received an
account of their &s;ucce&s;s before he had quitted the lines of
Ticonderoga. General Prideaux, with his body of troops,
re-enforced by the Indian auxiliaries under Sir William
John&s;on, advanced to the cataract of Niagara, without
being expo&s;ed to the lea&s;t inconvenience on his march;
and inve&s;ting the French fortre&s;s about the middle of
July, carried on his approaches with great vigour till the
twentieth day of that month, when, vi&s;iting the trenches,
he was unfortunately &s;lain by the bur&s;ting of a cohorn.
Mr. Amher&s;t was no &s;ooner informed of his di&s;a&s;ter, than
he detached Brigadier-General Gage from Ticonderoga,
to a&s;&s;ume the command of that army. In the mean time,
it devolved on Sir William John&s;on, who happily pro&s;ecut|ed
the plan of his predece&s;&s;or with all the &s;ucce&s;s that
could have been de&s;ired. The enemy, alarmed with the
apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing a place of &s;uch importance, re&s;olv|ed
to exert their endeavours for its relief. They a&s;&s;em|bled
a body of regular troops, amounting to twelve hun|dred
men, drawn from Detroit, Venango, and Pre&s;que
I&s;le; and the&s;e, with a number of Indian auxiliaries, were
detached under the command of Mon&s;ieur d'Aubry, on
an attempt to re-enforce the garri&s;on of Niagara. Sir Wil|liam
John&s;on having received intelligence of their de&s;ign,
made a di&s;po&s;ition to intercept them in their march. In
the evening he ordered the light infantry and picquets to
po&s;t them&s;elves to the left, on the road leading from Nia|gara
falls to the fortre&s;s: the&s;e were re-enforced in the
morning with the grenadiers, and part of the forty-&s;ixth
regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Ma&s;&s;ey;
and another regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Farquhar,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
was po&s;ted at the tall of the works, in order to &s;upport the
guard of the trenches. About eight in the morning, the
enemy being in &s;ight, the Indians in the Engli&s;h army ad|vanced
to &s;peak with their countrymen who &s;erved under
the French banners; but this conference was declined
by the enemy. Then the French Indians having uttered
the horrible &s;cream called the war-whoop, which by this
time had lo&s;t its effect among the Briti&s;h forces, the ene|my
began the action with impetuo&s;ity: but they met with
&s;uch a hot reception in front, while the Indian auxiliaries
fell upon their flanks, that in a little more than half an
hour their whole army was routed, their general, with all
his officers, taken, and the pur&s;uit continued through the
woods for &s;everal miles with con&s;iderable &s;laughter. This
battle, which happened on the twenty-fourth day of July,
having been fought in &s;ight of the French garri&s;on at
Niagara, Sir William John&s;on &s;ent Major Harvey with a
trumpet to the commanding officer, to pre&s;ent him with a
li&s;t of &s;eventeen officers taken in the engagement, and to
exhort him to &s;urrender before more blood was &s;hed, while
he had it in his power to re&s;train the Indians. The com|mandant,
having certified him&s;elf of the truth, by &s;end|ing
an officer to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners, agreed to treat, and in
a few hours the capitulation was ratified. The garri&s;on,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix hundred and &s;even effective men, marched
out with the honours of war, in order to be embarked in
ve&s;&s;els on the lake, and conveyed in the mo&s;t expeditious
manner to New-York. They laid down their arms when
they embarked; but were permitted to keep their baggage,
and, by a proper e&s;corte, protected from the &s;avage in&s;o|lence
and rapacity of the Indians. All the women were con|ducted,
at their own reque&s;t, to Montreal; and the &s;ick
and wounded, who could not bear the &s;atigue of travelling,
were treated with humanity. This was the &s;econd com|plete
victory obtained on the continent of North-America,
in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame war, by Sir William John&s;on,
who, without the help of a military education, &s;ucceeded
&s;o &s;ignally in the field by dint of innate courage and natural
<PB N="34" REF="37">
&s;agacity. What remarkably characteri&s;es the&s;e battles,
is the circum&s;tance of his having taken in both the
commander of the enemy. Indeed, the war in general
may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s of this gen|tleman
and the celebrated Lord Clive, two &s;elf-taught
generals; who, by a &s;eries of &s;hining actions, have de|mon&s;trated,
that unin&s;tructed genius can, by its own in|ternal
light and efficacy, rival, if not eclip&s;e, the acquired
art of di&s;cipline and experience. Sir William John&s;on
was not more &s;erviceable to his country by his valour and
conduct in the field, than by the influence and authority
which his ju&s;tice, benevolence, and integrity had acquired
among the Indian tribes of the Six Nations, whom he not
only a&s;&s;embled at Niagara to the number of eleven hun|dred,
but al&s;o re&s;trained with the bounds of good order
and moderation.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The reduction of Niagara, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Crown-Point, were exploits much more ea&s;ily atchieved
than the conque&s;t of Quebeck, the great object to which
all the&s;e operations were &s;ubordinate. Of that we now
come to give the detail, fraught with &s;ingular adventures
and &s;urpri&s;ing events; in the cour&s;e of which a noble &s;pirit
of enterpri&s;e was di&s;played, and the &s;cenes of war were
exhibited in all the variety of de&s;olation. It was about
the middle of February that a con&s;iderable &s;quadron &s;ailed
from England for Cape-Breton, under the command of
Admirals Saunders and Holmes, two gentlemen of worth
and probity, who had on &s;everal occa&s;ions &s;ignali&s;ed their
courage and conduct in the &s;ervice of their country. By
the twenty-fir&s;t day of April they were in &s;ight of Loui&s;|bourg;
but the harbour was blocked up with ice in &s;uch
a manner, that they were obliged to bear away for Hali|fax,
in Nova-Scotia. From hence Rear-Admiral Durell
was detached, with a &s;mall &s;quadron, to fail up the river
St. Laurence as far as the i&s;le de Coudres, in order to in|tercept
any &s;upplies from France intended for Quebec$$$
he accordingly took two &s;tore-&s;hips; but he was anticipated
by &s;eventeen $ail, laden with provi&s;ion, &s;tores, and &s;ome
<PB N="35" REF="38">
recruits, under convoy of three frigates, which had already
reached the capital of Canada. Mean while, Admiral
Saunders arrived at Loui&s;bourg; and the troops being em|barked,
to the number of eight thou&s;and, proceeded up
the river without further delay. The operations by land
were entru&s;ted to the conduct of Major-General James
Wolfe, who&s;e talents had &s;hone with &s;uch &s;uperior lu&s;tre
at the &s;iege of Loui&s;bourg; and his &s;ubordinates in com|mand
were the Brigadiers Monckton, Town&s;hend, and
Murray; all four in the flower of their age, who had
&s;tudied the military art with equal eagerne&s;s and profi|ciency,
and, though young in years, were old in experi|ence.
The fir&s;t was a &s;oldier by de&s;cent, the &s;on of Major-General
Wolfe, a veteran officer of acknowledged capa|city:
the other three re&s;embled each other, not only in
years, qualifications, and &s;tation, but al&s;o in family rank,
all three being the &s;ons of noblemen. The &s;ituation of
Brigadier Town&s;hend was &s;ingular: he had &s;erved abroad
in the la&s;t war with reputation, and re&s;igned his com|mi&s;&s;ion
during the peace, in di&s;clain of &s;ome hard u&s;age he
had &s;u&s;tained from his &s;uperiors. That his military ta|lents,
however, might not be lo&s;t to his country, he exer|ci&s;ed
them with equal &s;pirit and per&s;everance in projecting
and promoting the plan of a national militia. When the
command and direction of the army devolved to a new
leader, &s;o predominant in his brea&s;t was the &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m
and the love of glory, that though heir apparent
to a Briti&s;h peerage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very affluent fortune,
remarkably dear to his acquaintance, and &s;ollicited to a
life of quiet by every allurement of dome&s;tick felicity, he
waved the&s;e con&s;iderations: he bur&s;t from all entangle|ments;
proffered his &s;ervices to his &s;overeign; expo&s;ed
him&s;elf to the perils of a di&s;agreeable voyage, the rigours
of a &s;evere climate, and the hazard of a campaign pecu|liarly
fraught with toil, danger, and difficulty.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The armament intended for Quebeck $ailed
up the river St. Laurence, without having met with any
interruption, or having perceived any of tho&s;e difficul|ties
<PB N="36" REF="39">
and perils with which it had been reported that the
navigation of it was attended.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> Their good fortune in this
particular, indeed, was owing to &s;ome excellent charts
of the river, which had been found in ve&s;&s;els taken from
the enemy. About the latter end of June the land-forces
were di&s;embarked in two divi&s;ions upon the i&s;le of Or|leans,
&s;ituated a little below Quebeck, a large fertile i&s;land,
well cultivated, producing plenty of grain, abounding
with people, villages, and plantations. General Wolfe no
&s;ooner landed on the i&s;land of Orleans, than he di&s;tributed
a manife&s;to among the French coloni&s;ts, giving them to
under&s;tand, That the King his ma&s;ter, ju&s;tly exa&s;perated
again&s;t the French monarch, had equipped a con$iderable
armament, in order to humble his pride, and was deter|mined
to reduce the mo&s;t con&s;iderable French &s;ettlements
in America. He declared, it was not again&s;t the indu|&s;tricus
pea&s;ants, their wives, and children, nor again&s;t the
mini&s;ters of religion, that he intended to make war: on
the contrary, he lamented his misfortunes to which they
mu&s;t be expo&s;ed by the quarrel: he offered them his
protection, and promi&s;ed to maintain them in their tem|poral
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as well as in the free exerci$e of their
religion, provided they would remain quiet, and take no
part in the difference between the two crowns. He ob|&s;erved,
that the Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters of the river St. Lau|rence,
&s;o as to intercept all &s;uccours from Europe, and
had, be&s;ides, a powerful army on the continent, under the
command of General Amher&s;t. He affirmed, that the
re&s;olution they ought to take was neither difficult nor
doubtful, as the utmo&s;t exertion of their valour would be
u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;erve only to deprive them of the advantages
which they might reap from their neutrality. He remind|ed
them, that the cruelties exerci&s;ed by the French upon
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain in America would excu&s;e
the mo&s;t &s;evere repri&s;als; but Britons were too generous
to follow &s;uch barbarous examples. He again offered to
the Canadians the &s;weets of peace, amid&s;t the horrours of
war; and le$t it to them&s;elves to determine their own fate
<PB N="37" REF="40">
by their own conduct. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that the
world would do him ju&s;tice, &s;hould they oblige him,
by rejecting the&s;e favourable terms, to adopt violent mea|&s;ures.
He expatiated upon the &s;trength and power, as
well as upon the genero&s;ity of Great Britain, in thus
&s;tretching out the hand of humanity; a hand ready to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them on all occa&s;ions, even when France was, by her
weakne&s;s, compelled to abandon them in the mo&s;t critical
conjuncture. This declaration produced no immediate
effect; nor, indeed, did the Canadians depend upon the
&s;incerity and promi&s;ed faith of a nation, whom their
prie&s;ts had indu&s;triou&s;ly repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t &s;avage and
cruel enemy on earth. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e notions, which
prevailed even among the better &s;ort, they cho&s;e to abandon
their habitations, and expo&s;e them&s;elves and families to
certain ruin, in provoking the Engli&s;h by the mo&s;t cruel
ho&s;tilities, rather than be quiet, and con&s;ide in the Ge|neral's
promi&s;e of protection. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing this
prudent plan of conduct, they joined the &s;calping parties<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The operations of &s;calping, which, to the &s;hame of both nations, was en|couraged both by French and Engli&s;h, the &s;avages perform in this manner:&mdash;The hap$e&s;s victim being di&s;abled, or di&s;armed, the Indian, with a &s;harp knife, provided and worn for the purpo&s;e, makes a circular inci&s;ion to the bone round the upper part of the head, and tear$ of the &s;calp with his &s;in|gers. Previous to this execution, he generally di&s;patches the pri&s;oner by re|peated blows on the head with the hammer-&s;ide of an in&s;trument called a $omahawk: but &s;ometimes they &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble, and &s;ometimes the blows prove ineffectual, &s;o that the mi&s;erable patient i$, $ound $word$ groaning in the utmo&s;t agony of torture. The Indian &s;trings the &s;calps he has procured, to be produced as a te&s;timony of his prowels, and receives a premium for each from the nation under who&s;e banners he had inli&s;ted.</NOTE>
of Indians who &s;kulked among the woods, and falling
upon the Engli&s;h &s;tragglers by &s;urpri&s;e, butchered them
with the mo&s;t inhuman barbarity. Mr. Wolfe, who&s;e na|ture
revolted again&s;t this wanton and perfidious cruelty,
&s;ent a letter to the French general, repre&s;enting, that &s;uch
enormities were contrary to the rules of war ob&s;erved
among civilized nations, di&s;honourable to the &s;ervice of
France, and di&s;graceful to human nature: he, therefore,
de&s;ired the French coloni&s;ts and Indians might be re|&s;trained
<PB N="38" REF="41">
within due bounds, otherwi&s;e he would burn their
villages, de&s;olate their plantations, and retaliate upon the
per&s;ons of his pri&s;oners whatever cruel ties &s;hould, in the
&s;equel, be committed on the &s;oldiers or &s;ubjects of his ma&s;|ter.
In all probability the French general's authority was
not &s;ufficient to bridle the ferocity of the &s;avages, who
continued to &s;calp and murther with the mo&s;t brutal ap|petite
for blood and revenge; &s;o that Mr. Wolfe, in or|der
to intimidate the enemy into a ce&s;&s;ation of the&s;e out|rages,
found it nece&s;&s;ary to connive at &s;ome irregularities
in the way of retaliation.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. M. de Montcalm, who commanded the French
troops, though &s;uperior in number to the invaders, very
wi&s;ely re&s;olved to depend upon the natural &s;trength of
the country, which appeared almo&s;t in&s;urmountable, and
had carefully taken all his precautions of defence. The ci|ty
of Quebeck was tolerably fortified, &s;ecured with a nu|merous
garri&s;on, and plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ion
and ammunition. Montcalm had re-enforced the troops
of the colony with five regular battalions, formed of the
be&s;t of the inhabitants, completely di&s;ciplined all the Ca|nadians
of the neighbourhood capable of bearing arms,
and &s;everal tribes of &s;avages. With this army he had taken
the field in a very advantageous &s;ituation, encamped along
the &s;hore of Beaufort, from the river St. Charles to the
falls of Montmorenci, every acce&s;&s;ible part being deeply
entrenched. To undertake the &s;iege of Quebeck again&s;t
&s;uch odds and advantages was not only a deviation from
the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims of war, but a ra&s;h enterpri&s;e, &s;eem|ingly
urged in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the dictates of
common &s;en&s;e. Mr. Wolfe was well acquainted with all
the difficulties of the undertaking; but he knew at the
&s;ame time he &s;hould always have it in his power to retreat
in ca&s;e of emergency, while the Briti&s;h &s;quadron main|tained
its &s;tation in the river: he was not without hope
of being joined by General Amher&s;t; and he was &s;timu|lated
by an appetite for glory, which the pro&s;pect of ac|cumulated
dangers could not allay. Under&s;tanding that
<PB N="39" REF="42">
there was a body of the enemy po&s;ted, with cannon, at the
Point of Levi, on the &s;outh &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to the city of
Quebeck, he detached again&s;t them Brigadier Monckton,
at the head of four battalions, who pa&s;&s;ed the river at
night, and next morning, having &s;kirmi&s;hed with &s;ome
of the enemy's irregulars, obliged them to retire from that
po&s;t, which the Engli&s;h immediately occupied. At the
&s;ame time Colonel Carlton, with another detachment,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the we&s;tern point of the i&s;land of Or|leans;
and both the&s;e po&s;ts were fortified, in order to
anticipate the enemy, who, had they kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
either, might have rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;hip to
lie at anchor within two miles of Quebeck. Be&s;ides, the
Point of Levi was within cannon-&s;hot of the city, again&s;t
which a battery of mortars and artillery was immediately
erected. Montcalm, fore&s;eeing the effect of this manoeu|vre,
detached a body of &s;ixteen hundred men acro&s;s the
river, to attack and de&s;troy the works before they were
completed: but the detachment fell into di&s;order, fired
upon each other, and retired in confu&s;ion. The battery
being fini&s;hed without further interruption, the cannon
and mortars began to play with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in a lit|tle
time the upper town was con&s;iderably damaged, and
the lower town reduced to a heap of rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. In the mean time, the fleet was expo&s;ed to the
mo&s;t imminent danger. Immediately after the troops had
been landed on the i&s;land of Orleans the wind increa&s;ed
to a furious &s;torm, which blew with &s;uch violence, that
many tran&s;ports ran foul of one another, and were di&s;abled.
A number of boats and &s;mall craft foundered, and divers
large &s;hips lo&s;t their anchors. The enemy, re&s;olving to
take advantage of the confu&s;ion which they imagined
this di&s;a&s;ter mu&s;t have produced, prepared &s;even fire-&s;hips,
and at midnight &s;ent them down from Quebeck among the
tran&s;ports, which lay &s;o thick as to cover the whole &s;ur|face
of the river. The &s;cheme, though well contrived, and
&s;ea&s;onably executed, was entirely defeated by the delibe|ration
of the Briti&s;h admiral, and the dexterity of his ma|riners,
<PB N="40" REF="43">
who re&s;olutely boarded the fire-&s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> and towed them
&s;a&s;t a-ground, where they lay burning to the water's edge,
without having done the lea&s;t prejudice to the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron. On the very &s;ame day of the &s;ucceeding
month, they &s;ent down a raft of fire-&s;hips, or radeaux,
which likewi&s;e con&s;umed, without producing any effect.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The works for the &s;ecurity of the ho&s;pital, and
the &s;tores on the i&s;land of Orleans, being fini&s;hed, the
Briti&s;h forces cro&s;&s;ed the north channel in boats, and
landing under cover of two &s;loops, encamped on the &s;ide
of the river Montmorenci, which divided them from the
left of the enemy. Next morning a company of rangers
po&s;ted in a wood to cover &s;ome workmen were attacked
by the French Indians and totally defeated: however,
the neare&s;t troops advancing, repul&s;ed the Indians in their
turn with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The rea&s;ons that induced
General Wolfe to choo&s;e this &s;ituation by the falls of
Montmorenci, in which he was divided from Quebeck by
this, and another river called St. Charles, he explained in
a letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. He ob&s;erved, that the
ground which he had cho&s;en was high, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
commanded the oppo&s;ite &s;ide on which the enemy
was po&s;ted: that there was a ford below the falls, pa&s;&s;able
in every tide for &s;ome hours at the latter part of the ebb
and beginning of the flood; and he hoped that means
might be found of pa&s;&s;ing the river higher up, &s;o as to
tight the Marquis de Montcalm upon le&s;s di&s;advantageous
terms than tho&s;e of directly attacking his entrenchments.
Accordingly, in reconnoitering the river Montmorenci,
a ford was di&s;covered about three miles above; but the op|po&s;ite
banks, which were naturally &s;teep, and covered with
woods, the enemy had entrenched in &s;uch a manner, as
to render it almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. The e&s;corte was twice at|tached
by the Indians, who were as often repul&s;ed; but
the&s;e rencounters co&s;t the Engli&s;h about forty men killed
and wounded, including &s;ome officers. Some &s;hrewd ob|jections
might be &s;tarted to the general's choice of ground
on this occa&s;ion. He could not act at all without pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="41" REF="44">
the river Montmorenci at a very great di&s;advantage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XI. 1759.</NOTE> and
attacking an enemy &s;uperior to him&s;elf in number, &s;ecured
by redoubts and entrenchments. Had he even, by dint of
extraordinary valour driven them from the&s;e &s;trong po&s;ts,
the &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t have co&s;t him a great number of officers
and men; and the enemy might have retreated behind
the river St. Charles, which he mu&s;t al&s;o have pa&s;&s;ed under
the &s;ame di&s;advantages, before he could begin his opera|tions
again&s;t the city of Quebeck. Had his good fortune
enabled him to &s;urmount all the&s;e difficulties, and after
all to defeat the enemy in a pitched battle, the garri&s;on
of Quebeck might have been re-enforced by the wreck of
their army; and he could not, with any probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
have undertaken the &s;iege of an exten&s;ive fortified
place, which he had not troops &s;ufficient to inve&s;t, and
who&s;e garri&s;on would have been nearly equal in number
to the &s;um total of the troops he commanded. At any
rate, the chance of a fair engagement in the open field was
what he had little rea&s;on to expect in that &s;ituation, from
the known experience and the apparent conduct of the
French general. The&s;e objections appeared &s;o obvious and
important, that General Wolfe would not determine to
ri&s;que an attack, until he had &s;urveyed the upper part
of the river St. Laurence, in hopes of finding &s;ome place
more favourable for a de&s;cent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. On the eighteenth day of July, the Admiral,
at his reque&s;t, &s;ent two &s;hips of war, two armed &s;loops,
and &s;ome tran&s;ports, with troops on board, up the river;
and they pa&s;&s;ed the city of Quebeck, without having &s;u&s;|tained
any damage. The General being on board of this
little armament, carefully ob&s;erved the banks on the &s;ide
of the enemy, which were extremely difficult from the
nature of the ground, and the&s;e difficulties were redoubled
by the $ore&s;ight and precaution of the French comman|der.
Though the de&s;cent &s;eemed impracticable between the
city and Cape Rouge, where it was intended, General
Wolfe, in order to divide the enemy's force, and procure in|telligence,
ordered a detachment, under the command of
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Colonel Carlton, to land higher up, at the Point au Tre$|ble,
in which place he was informed a great number $word$
the inhabitants of Quebeck had retired with their mo$|valuable
effects. This &s;ervice was performed with little
lo&s;s, and &s;ome pri&s;oners were brought away, but no maga|zine
was di&s;covered. The general thus di&s;appointed in his
expectation, returned to Montmorenci, where Brigadie$.
Town&s;hend had, by maintaining a &s;uperior fire acro&s;s that
that river, prevented the enemy from erecting a battery,
which would have commanded the Engli&s;h camp; and
now he re&s;olved to attack them, though po&s;ted to great
advantage, and every where prepared to give him a warm
reception. His de&s;ign was, fir&s;t, to reduce a detached re|doubt
clo&s;e to the water's edge, &s;eemingly &s;ituated with|out
gun-&s;hot of the entrenchment on the hill. Should this
fortification be &s;upported by the enemy, he fore&s;aw that
he &s;hould be able to bring on a general engagement; $word$
the contrary, &s;hould they remain tame &s;pectators of its re|duction,
he could afterwards examine their &s;ituation a$
lei&s;ure, and determine the place at which they could be
mo&s;t ea&s;ily attacked. Preparations were accordingly mad$
for &s;torming the redoubt. On the la&s;t day of July, in the
forenoon, part of Brigadier Monckton's brigade was em|barked
in the boats of the fleet, to be tran&s;ported from
the Point of Levi. The two brigades, commanded by the
Brigadiers Town&s;hend and Murray, were drawn out, in
order to pa&s;s the ford when it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. To
facilitate their pa&s;&s;age, the Admiral had &s;tationed the
Centurion &s;hip of war in the channel, to check the $ire o$
the lower battery, by which the ford was commanded: $word$
numerous train of artillery was placed upon the emi$$ence,
to batter and en&s;ilade the left of the enemy's entrench|ments;
and two flat-bottomed armed ve&s;&s;els, prepared for
the purpo&s;e, were run a-ground near the redoubt, to favour
the de&s;cent of the forces. The manife&s;t confu&s;ion produced
among the French by the&s;e previous mea&s;ures, and by the
&s;ire of the Centurion, which was well directed and &s;u&s;|tained,
determined Mr. Wolfe to &s;torm this entrench|ment
<PB N="43" REF="46">
without further delay. Orders were i&s;&s;ued, that the
three brigadiers &s;hould put their troops in motion at a cer|tain
&s;ignal, which was accordingly made at a proper time
of the tide. Many of the boats from Point Levi ran
a-ground upon a ledge that runs off a con&s;iderable di&s;tance
from the &s;hore; and this accident occa&s;ioned a di&s;order, by
which &s;o much time was lo&s;t, that the general was obliged
to &s;top the march of Brigadier Town&s;hend's corps, which
he perceived to be in motion. In the mean time, the boats
were floated, and ranged in proper order, though expo&s;ed
to a &s;evere fire of &s;hot and &s;hells; and the general in per|&s;on
&s;ounding the &s;hore, pointed out the place where the
troops might di&s;embark with the lea&s;t difficulty. Thir|teen
companies of grenadiers, and two hundred men of
the &s;econd American battalion, were the fir&s;t who landed.
They had received orders to form in four di&s;tinct bodies,
and begin the attack, &s;upported by the corps of Brigadier
Monckton, as &s;oon as the other troops &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed
the ford, and be near enough to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
The&s;e in&s;tructions, however, were entirely ne|glected.
Before Mr. Monckton had landed, and while
Brigadier Town&s;hend was on his march at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, the grenadiers, without waiting to be drawn up
in any regular form, impetuou&s;ly ru&s;hed towards the ene|my's
entrenchments in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. Their cou|rage
&s;erved only to increa&s;e their misfortune. The fir&s;t
fire they received did &s;uch execution among them, that
they were obliged to &s;helter them&s;elves under the redoubt
which the French had abandoned at their approach. In
this uncomfortable &s;ituation they remained &s;ome time,
unable to form under &s;o hot a fire, notwith&s;tanding the ut|mo&s;t
efforts of many gallant officers, who lavi&s;hly ex|po&s;ed,
and even lo&s;t their lives in the honourable di&s;charge
of their duty<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following anecdote is &s;o remarkable, and tends &s;o much to the honour of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiery, that we in&s;ert it without &s;eat of the reader's di&s;approbation:&mdash;Captain Och$erlony and En&s;ign Peyton belonged to the regiment of Brigadier-General Monckton. They were nearly of an age, which did not exceed thirty; the fir&s;t was a North-Briton, the other a $word$ of Ireland. Both were agreeable in per&s;on, and unblemi&s;hed in chara$$$ and connected together by the ties of mutual friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. On the day that preceded the battle, Captain Ochterlony had been obliged to $span$ duel with a German officer; in which, though he wounded and $span$ antagoni&s;t, yet he him&s;elf received a dangerous hurt under the right $word$ con&s;equence of which his friends in&s;i&s;ted on his remaining in camp $word$ the action of next day; but his &s;pirit was too great to comply with $$$$ mon&s;trance. He declared it &s;hould never be &s;aid that a &s;cratch received $word$ private rencounter had prevented him from doing his duty, when his coun$$$ required his &s;ervice; and he took the field with a fu&s;il in his hand, though he was hardly able to carry his arms. In leading up his men to the $word$ entrenchment, he was &s;hot through the lungs with a mu&s;quet-ball, an $$$ dent which obliged him to part with his fu&s;il: but he &s;till continued a$|vancing, until, by lo&s;s of blood, he became too weak to proceed farther. About the &s;ame time Mr. Peyton was lamed by a &s;hot, which &s;hattered the &s;mall bone of his left leg. The &s;oldiers, in their retreat, earne&s;tly begged, with tears in their eyes, that Captain Ochterlony would allow them to $word$ him and the en&s;ign o$$ the field. But he was &s;o bigotted to a &s;evere point $word$ honour, that he would not quit the ground, though he de&s;ired they would take care of his en&s;ign. Mr. Peyton, with a generous di&s;dain, rejected their good o$fice$r, declaring that he would not leave his captain in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and in a little time they remained the &s;ole &s;urvivors on that part of the field.</P>
<P>Captain Ochterlony &s;at down by his friend, and, as they expected nothing but immediate death, they took leave of each other; yet they were not alto$gether abandoned by the hope of being protected as pri&s;oners: for the capt$$ &s;eeing a French &s;oldier with two Indians approach, &s;tarted up, and $span$ them in the French language, which he &s;poke perfectly well, expre&s;&s;ed $word$ expectation that they would treat him and his companion as officers, pri&s;oner, and gentlemen. The two Indians &s;eemed to be entirely under the $word$ of the Frenchman, who coming up to Mr. Peyton, as he &s;at on the $word$ &s;natched his $aced hat from his head, and robbed the captain of his $span$ money. This outrage was a &s;ignal to the Indians for murther and $word$ One of them, clubbing his firelock, &s;truck at him behind, with a view to knock him down, but the blow mi&s;&s;ing his head, took place upon $span$ At the &s;ame in&s;tant the other Indian po$red his &s;hot$ into the $span$ unfortunate young gentleman, who cried out, &startq;O Peyton! the $span$ &s;hot me.&endq; Not yet &s;atiated with cruelty, the barbarian &s;prung upon $word$ and &s;tabbed him in the belly with his &s;calping knife. The captain, $word$ pa$$ed with his fu&s;i, had no weapon for his defence, as none of the $word$ wore &s;words in the action. The three $ru&s;&s;ians, finding him &s;till alive, $word$ deavoured to &s;trangle him with his own $word$; and he was now upon his $word$ &s;truggling again&s;t them with &s;urpri&s;ing exertion. Mr. Peyton, at $word$ juncture, having a double barrelled mu$quet in his hand, and &s;eeing the $word$ of his friend, fired at one of the Indians, who dropped dead upon the $word$. The other, thinking the en&s;ign would now be an ea&s;y prey, advanced towards him, and Mr. Peyton, having taken good aim at the di&s;tance of four yards, di&s;charged his piece the &s;econd time, but it &s;eemed to take no effect. The &s;avage fired in his turn, and wounded the en&s;ign in the &s;houlder; then ru&s;h|ing upon him, thru&s;t his bayonet through his body. He repeated the blow, which Mr. Peyton attempting to pa$ry, received another wound in his left hand, neverthele&s;s he &s;ei&s;ed the Indian's mu&s;ket with the &s;ame hand, pulled him forwards, and with his right drawing a dagger which hung by his &s;ide, plunged it in the barbarian's &s;ide. A violent &s;truggle en&s;ued: but at length Mr. Peyton was uppermo&s;t, and, with repeated &s;trokes of his dagger, killed his antagoni&s;t outright. Here he was &s;ei&s;ed with an unaccountable emotion of curio&s;ity, to know whether or not his &s;hot had taken place on the body of the Indian; he accordingly turned him up, and &s;tripping off his blanket, per|ceived that the ball had penetrated quite through the cavity of the brea&s;t. Having thus obtained a dea$-bought victory, he &s;tarted up on one leg, and &s;aw Capain Ochterlony &s;tanding at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty-yards, clo&s;e by the enemy's brea&s;t work, with the French &s;oldier attending him. Mr. Peyton then called aloud, &startq;Captain Ochterlony, I am glad to &s;ee you have at la&s;t got under protection. Beware of that villain, who is more barbarous than the &s;avages. God ble&s;s you, my dear Captain. I &s;ee a party of Indians coming this way, and expect to be murthered immediately.&endq; A number of tho&s;e barbarians had for &s;ome time been employed on the left in &s;calping and pillaging the dying and the dead that were left upon the field of battle; and above thirty of them were in full march to de&s;troy Mr. Peyton. This gentleman knew he had no mercy to expect: for, &s;hould his life be &s;pared for the pre&s;ent, they would have afterwards in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;acrificing him to the manes of their brethren whom he had &s;lain: and in that ca&s;e he would have been put to death by the mo&s;t excruciating tortures. Full of this idea, he &s;natched up his mu&s;ket, and, notwith&s;tanding his broken leg, ran above forty yards without halting: feeling him&s;elf now totally di&s;abled, and incapable of proceeding one &s;lep farther, he loaded his piece, and pre&s;ented it to the two foremo&s;t Indians, who &s;tood aloof, waiting to be joined by their fellows: while the French, from their brea&s;t works, kept up a continual fire of can|non and &s;mall arms upon this poor, &s;o it a$y, maimed gentleman. In this uncomfortable &s;ituation he &s;tood, when he di&s;cerned at a di&s;tance a High|land officer, with a party of his men, &s;kirting the plain towards the field of battle. He forthwith waved his hand in &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, and being per|ceived by the officer, he detached three of his men to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e brave fellows ha&s;tened to him through the mid&s;t of a terrible fire, and one of them bo$e him o$$ on his &s;houlders. The Highland officer was Captain Macdonald, of Colonel Frazier's battalion; who under&s;tanding that a young gentleman, his kin&s;man, had dropped on the field of battle, had put him&s;elf at the head of this party, with which he penetrated to the middle of the field, drove $ con&s;iderable number of the French and Indians before him, and find|ing his relation &s;till un&s;calped, carried him off in triumph. Poor Captain Ochterlony was conveyed to Quebeck, where in a few days he died of $word$ wounds. After the reduction of that place, the French &s;urgeons who attended him declared, that, in all probability, he would have recovered of the two &s;hots he had received in his brea&s;t, had not he been mortally wounded $word$ the belly by the Indian's &s;calping knife.</P>
<P>As this very remarkable &s;eene was acted in $ight of both armies, Gene$$$ Town&s;hend, in the &s;equel, expo&s;tulated with the French officers upon the inhumanity of keeping up &s;uch a &s;evere fire again&s;t two wounded gentlemen&punc; who were di&s;abled, and de&s;titute of all hope of e&s;caping. They an&s;wered&punc; that the fire was not made by the regulars, but by the Canadians and $word$ whom it was not in the power of di&s;cipline to re&s;train.</P></NOTE>. The general &s;eeing all their endeavours
<PB N="44" REF="47">
abortive, ordered them to retreat, and form behind Monck|ton's
brigade, which was, by this time, landed and drawn
<PB N="45" REF="48">
up to the beach in order. They accordingly retired in
confu&s;ion, leaving a con&s;iderable number lying on the
<PB N="46" REF="49">
field, to the barbarity of the Indian &s;avages, who $word$
the living, and &s;calped the dead, even in &s;ight of
their indignant companions. This unhappy accident oc|ca&s;ioned
a new delay, and the day was already far ad|vanced.
The wind began to blow with uncommon vio|lence,
and the tide to make; &s;o that, in ca&s;e of a &s;econd
repul&s;e, the retreat of Brigadier Town&s;hend might have
been rendered hazardous and uncertain; Mr. Wolfe,
therefore, thought proper to de&s;i&s;t, and returned without
further mole&s;tation to the other &s;ide of the river Montmo|renci.
The Admiral ordered the two ve&s;&s;els which were
a-ground to be &s;et on fire, that they might not fall into
the hands of the enemy, The advantages that favoured
an attack in this part con&s;i&s;ted of the following particu|lars:
All the artillery could be u&s;ed with good effect; all
the troops could act at once; and, in ca&s;e of a mi&s;carriage,
the retreat was &s;ecure and open, at lea&s;t for a certain
time of the tide. The&s;e, however, &s;eemed to be over-balanced
by other con&s;iderations. The enemy were po&s;ted
on a commanding eminence; the beach was covered with
deep mud, &s;lippery, and broken into holes and gullies;
the hill was &s;teep, and in &s;ome places impracticable; the
enemy were numerous, and poured in a very &s;evere fire
from their entrenchments. Had the attack &s;ucceeded, the
lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h mu&s;t have been very heavy, and that
of the French incon&s;iderable, becau&s;e the neighbouring
woods afforded them immediate &s;helter; finally, the
river St. Charles &s;till remained to be pa&s;&s;ed, before the
town could be inve&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50">
&sect; XXIII. Immediately after this mortifying check, in
which above five hundred men, and many brave officers,
were lo&s;t, the General detached Brigadier Murray, with
twelve hundred men, in tran&s;ports, above the town, to
co-operate with Rear-Admiral Holmes, whom the ad|miral
had &s;ent up with &s;ome force again&s;t the French
&s;hipping, which he hoped to de&s;troy. The Brigadier was
likewi&s;e in&s;tructed to &s;ei&s;e every opportunity of fighting
the enemy's detachments, and even of provoking them tobattle. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e directions, he twice attempt|ed
to land on the north &s;hore; but the&s;e attempts were
un&s;ucce&s;sful. The third effort was more fortunate. He
made a &s;udden de&s;cent at Chambaud, and burned a con&s;i|derable
magazine, filled with arms, clothing, provi&s;ion,
and ammunition. The enemy's &s;hips being &s;ecured in
&s;uch a manner as not to be approached, and nothing el&s;e
occuring that required the brigadier's longer &s;tay, he re|turned
to the camp, with intelligence obtained from his
pri&s;oners, that the fort of Niagara was taken, Crown-Point
abandoned, and General Amher&s;t employed in
making preparations to attack the corps at the I&s;leaux Noix
commanded by M. Burlemaque. The di&s;a&s;ter at the
falls of Montmorenci made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the mind
of General Wolfe&punc; who&s;e &s;pirit was too great to brook the
mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of cen&s;ure or di&s;grace. He knew
the character of the Engli&s;h people, ra&s;h, impatient, and
capricious; elevated to exultation by the lea&s;t gleam of
&s;ucce&s;s, dejected even to de&s;pondency by the mo&s;t incon&s;ider|able
frown of adver&s;e fortune; &s;anguine even to childi&s;h
hyperbole in applauding tho&s;e &s;ervants of the publick who
have pro&s;pered in their undertakings; clamorous to a degree
of per&s;ecution again&s;t tho&s;e who have mi&s;carried in their
endeavours, without any inve&s;tigation of merit, without
any con&s;ideration of circum&s;tances. A keen &s;en&s;e of the&s;e
vexatious peculiarities con&s;piring with &s;hame of di&s;|appointment,
an eager de&s;ire of retrieving the laurel that
he might by &s;ome be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t at the falls of
Montmorenci, and the de&s;pair of finding &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="48" REF="51">
excited an internal agitation, which vi&s;ibly affected
his external frame, and di&s;ordered his whole con&s;titution,
which was naturally delicate and tender. Among tho&s;e
who &s;hared his confidence, he was often &s;een to &s;igh; he
was often heard to complain, and even in the tran&s;ports
of his chagrin declare, that he would never return with|out
&s;ucce&s;s, to be expo&s;ed, as other unfortunate command|ers
had been, to the cen&s;ure and reproach of an ignorant
and ungrateful populace. This tumult of the mind, ad|ded
to the fatigues of body he had undergone, produced
a fever and dy&s;entery; by which, for &s;ome time, he was
totally di&s;abled.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. Before he recovered any degree of &s;trength, he
de&s;ired the general officers to con&s;ult together for the pub|lick
utility. It was their opinion, that the points of Levi
and Orleans being left in a proper &s;tate of defence, the
re&s;t of the troops &s;hould be conveyed up the river; with a
view to draw the enemy from their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
bring them if po&s;&s;ible to an engagement. This mea&s;ure,
however, was not adopted, until the General and Admiral
had reconnoitred the town of Quebeck, with a view to a
general a&s;&s;ault, and concluded from their own ob&s;ervations,
re-enforced by the opinion of the chief engineer, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the interiors of the place,
that &s;uch an attack could not be hazarded with any pro&s;|pect
of &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;hips of war, indeed, might have
$ilenced the batteries of the lower town; but they could
not affect the upper-works, from which they mu&s;t have
&s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage. When we con&s;ider the
&s;ituation of this place, and the fortifications with which it
was &s;ecured, the natural &s;trength of the country; the great
number of ve&s;&s;els and &s;loating batteries they had provided
for the defence of the river; the &s;kill, valour, &s;uperio$
force, and uncommon vigilance of the enemy; their $$|merous
bodies of &s;avages continually hovering about the
po&s;ts of the Engli&s;h, to &s;urpri&s;e parties and harra&s;s detach|ments;
we mu&s;t own that there was &s;uch a combination of
<PB N="49" REF="52">
difficulties as might have di&s;couraged and perplexed the
mo&s;t re&s;olute and intelligent commander.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In con&s;equence of the re&s;olution taken to quit
the camp at Montmorenci, the troops and artillery were
re-embarked, and landed at Point Levi: they afterwards
pa&s;&s;ed up the river in tran&s;ports, while Admiral Holmes
made a movement with his &s;hips, to amu&s;e the enemy
po&s;ted on the north &s;hore: and the men being much
crowded on board, the General ordered one half of them
to be landed for refre&s;hment on the other &s;ide of the ri|ver.
As no po&s;&s;ibility appeared of annoying the enemy
above the town, the &s;cheme of operations was totally
changed. A plan was formed for conveying the troops
farther down in boats, and landing them in the night
within a league of Cape Diamond, in hopes of a&s;cending
the heights of Abraham, which ri&s;e abruptly, with a &s;teep
a&s;cent, from the banks of the river, that they might take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground on the back of the city, where it
was but indifferently fortified. The dangers and difficul|ties
attending the execution of this de&s;ign were &s;o peculi|arly
di&s;couraging, that one would imagine it could not
have been embraced but by a &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e that border|ed
on de&s;peration. The &s;tream was rapid; the &s;hore &s;helving;
the bank of the river lined with &s;entinels; the landing
place &s;o narrow as to be ea&s;ily mi&s;&s;ed in the dark; and the
ground &s;o difficult as hardly to be &s;urmounted in the day|time,
had no oppo&s;ition been expected. If the enemy had
received the lea&s;t intimation from &s;py or de&s;erter, or even
&s;u&s;pected the &s;cheme: had the embarkation been di&s;order|ed,
in con&s;equence of the darkne&s;s of the night, the rapidity of
the river, or the &s;helving nature of the north &s;hore, near
which they were obliged to row: had one &s;entinel been
alarmed, or the landing-place much mi&s;taken, the heighths
of Abraham mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly &s;ecured by &s;uch a
force as would have rendered the undertaking abortive:
con&s;u&s;ion would nece&s;&s;arily have en&s;ued in the dark; and
this would have naturally produced a panick, which
might have proved fatal to the greater part of the detach|ment
<PB N="50" REF="53">
The&s;e objections could not e&s;cape the penetration
of the gallant Wolfe, who, neverthele&s;s, adopted the
plan without he&s;itation; and even executed it in per&s;on;
though at that time labouring under a &s;evere dy&s;entery and
fever, which had exhau&s;ted his con&s;titution, and reduced
him almo&s;t to an extremity of weakne&s;s. The previous
&s;teps being taken, and the time $ixed for this hazardous
attempt, Admiral Holmes moved with his &s;quadron farther
up the river, about three leagues above the place appoint|ed
for the di&s;embarkation, that he might deceive the ene|my,
and amu&s;e M. de Bougainville, whom Montcalm
had detached with fifteen hundred men to watch the mo|tions
of that &s;quadron; but the Engli&s;h admiral was di|rected
to fall down the river in the night, $o as to protect
the landing of the forces; and the&s;e orders he punctually
fulfilled. On the twelfth day of September, an hour after
midnight, the fir&s;t embarkation, con&s;i&s;ting of four com|plete
regiments, the light infantry, commanded by Colo|nel
Howe, a detachment of Highlanders, and the Ameri|can
grenadiers, was made in flat-bottomed boats, under
the immediate command of the Brigadiers Monckton and
Murray; though General Wolfe accompanied them in
per&s;on, and was among the fir&s;t who landed; and they
began to fall down with the tide, to the intended place of
di&s;embarkation; rowing clo&s;e to the north&s;hore, in order
to find it the more ea&s;ily. Without any di&s;order the boats
glided gently along; but by the rapidity of the tide, and
the darkne&s;s of the night, the boats over&s;hot the mark,
and the troops landed a little below the place at which the
di&s;embarkation was intended.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>How far the $word$ of thi$ attempt depended upon accident may be con|$$ived from the following particulars:&mdash;In the t$wilight two French de $word$ were carried on board a &s;hip of war, commanded by Captain Smith, and fying at anchor near the north &s;hore. They told him, that the garri&s;on o$ Quebe$$, expected that night to receive a convoy of provisions, &s;ent down the river in boat$, from the detachment above, commanded by M. de Bon|gainville. The&s;e $word$ &s;tanding upon deck, and perceiving the Engli&s;h boats with the troops gliding down the river in the dark, began to $word$, and make a noi&s;e, declaring they were part of the expected convoy. $word$ Smith, who was ignorant of General Wolfe's de&s;ign, believing their affirmation, had actually given orders to point the guns at the Briti&s;h troops&punc; when the General perceiving a commotion on board, rowed along-&s;ide in per|&s;on, and prevented the di&s;charge, which would have alarmed the town, and entirely fru&s;trated the attempt.</P>
<P>The French had po&s;ted &s;entries along &s;hore, to challenge boats and ve&s;&s;els, and give the alarm occa&s;ionally. The fir&s;t boat that contained the Engli&s;h troops being que&s;tioned accordingly, a captain of Fra&s;er's regiment, who had &s;erved in Holland, and who was perfectly well acquainted with the French language and cu&s;toms, an&s;wered without he&s;itation to <HI>Qui vit,</HI> which is their challenging word, <HI>la France:</HI> nor was be at a lo&s;s to an&s;wer the &s;econd que&s;tion, which was much more particular and difficult. When the &s;entinel demanded <HI>a quel regiment?</HI> to what regiment? the captain replied, <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which he knew, by accident, to be one of tho&s;e that compo&s;ed the body com|manded by Bougainville. The &s;oldier took it for granted this was the ex|pected convoy; and &s;aying <HI>pa&s;&s;e,</HI> allowed all the boats to proceed without further que&s;tion. In the &s;ame manner, the other &s;entries were deceived; though one, more wary than the re&s;t, came running down to the water's edge, and called, &startq;<HI>pourquoy e&s;t que veus ne $word$ plus haut?</HI> Why don't you &s;peak with an audible voice?&endq; To this interogation, which implied doubt, the captain an&s;wered, with admitable pre&s;ence of mind, in a &s;oft tone of voice, &startq;<HI>Ta$ tot, nous &s;erons entendue$!</HI> Hu&s;h! we &s;hall be overheard and di&s;covered.&endq; Thus cautioned, the &s;entry retired without further alter|cation. The mid&s;hipman who piloted the fir&s;t boat, pa&s;&s;ing by the landing place $n the dark, the &s;ame captain, who knew it, from his having been po&s;ted formerly with his company on the other &s;ide of the river, in&s;i&s;ted upon the pilot's being mi&s;taken, and commanded the rowers to put a&s;hore in the proper place, or at lea&s;t very near it.</P>
<P>When General Wolfe landed, and &s;aw the difficulty of a&s;cending the pre|cip$e, he &s;aid to the &s;ame officer, in a familiar &s;train, &startq;I don't believe there is any po&s;&s;ibility of getting up; but you mu&s;t do your endeavour.&endq; The narrow path that &s;lanted up the hill from the landing place the enemy had broken up and $endered impa&s;&s;able by cro&s;s ditches, be&s;ides the entrenchament at the top: in every other part the hill was to &s;$leep and dangerous, th$t the &s;oldiers were obliged to pull them&s;elves up by the roots and $word$ of $word$ growing on both &s;ides of the path.</P></NOTE> A$ the troops landed,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
the boats were &s;ent back for the &s;econd embarkation,
which was &s;uperintended by Brigadier Town&s;hend. In
the mean time, Colonel Howe, with the light infantry
and the Highlanders, a&s;cended the woody precipices with
admirable courage and activity; and di&s;lodged a &s;erjeant's
guard, which defended a &s;mall entrenched narrow path,
by which alone the re&s;t of the forces could reach the &s;um|mit.
Then they mounted, without further mole&s;tation
from the enemy, and the general drew them up in order
<PB N="52" REF="55">
as they arrived. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm no &s;ooner under|&s;tood
that the Engli&s;h had gained the heighths of Abraham,
which in a manner commanded the town on its weake&s;t
part, than he re&s;olved to hazard a battle, and began his
march without delay, after having collected his whole
force from the &s;ide of Beauport.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. General Wolfe, perceiving the enemy
cro&s;&s;ing the river St. Charles, began to form his own line,
which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix battalions, and the Loui&s;bourg
grenadiers; the right commanded by Brigadier Monck|ton,
and the left by Brigadier Murray: to the rear of the
left Colonel Howe was po&s;ted with his light infantry,
ju&s;t returned from a four-gun battery, which they had
taken without oppo&s;ition. M. de Montcalm advancing
in &s;uch a manner as to &s;hew his intention was to &s;$ank
the left of the Engli&s;h, Brigadier Town&s;hend was &s;ent
$hither with the regiment of Amher&s;t, which he formed
<HI>$word$,</HI> pre&s;enting a double front to the enemy: he was
afterwards re-enforced by two battalions, and the re&s;erve
con&s;i&s;ted of one regiment drawn up in eight &s;ub-divi&s;ions,
with large intervals. The right of the enemy was com|po&s;ed
of half the colony troops, two battalions, and a body
of Canadians and &s;avages: their centre con&s;i&s;ted of a column,
formed by two other regular battalions; and on the left
one battalion, with the remainder of the colony troops,
was po&s;ted: the bu&s;hes and corn-fields in their front were
$word$ with fifteen hundred of their be&s;t mark&s;men, who
kept up an irregular galling fire, which proved fatal to
many brave officers, thus &s;ingled out for de&s;truction. This
fire, indeed, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure checked by the advanced
po&s;ts of the Briti&s;h line, who piqu$ered with the enemy
for &s;ome hours before the battle began. Both armies were
de&s;titute of artillery, except two &s;mall pieces on the &s;ide
of the French, and a &s;ingle gun, which the Engli&s;h &s;eamen
had made &s;hift to draw up from the landing-place. This
was very well &s;erved, and galled their column &s;everely. At
length, about nine in the morning, the enemy advanced to
the charge with great order and vivacity, though their
<PB N="53" REF="56">
fire was irregular and ineffectual. On the contrary, the
Briti&s;h forces re&s;erved their &s;hot until the French had ap|proached
within forty yards of their line; then they poured
in a terrible di&s;charge, and continued the fire with &s;uch
deliberation and &s;pirit, as could not fail to produce a very
con&s;iderable effect. General Wolfe was &s;tationed on the
right, at the head of Bragg's regiment and the Loui&s;bourg
grenadiers, where the attack was mo&s;t warm. As he &s;tood
con&s;picuous in the front of the line, he had been aimed at
by the enemy's mark&s;men, and received a &s;hot in the wri&s;t,
which, however, did not oblige him to quit the field.
Having wrapped a handkerchief round his hand, he con|tinued
giving orders without the lea&s;t emotion, and ad|vanced
at the head of the grenadiers, with their bayonets
fixed, when another ball unfortunately pierced the brea&s;t
of this young hero<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When the fatal ball took place, General Wolfe, finding him&s;elf unable to &s;tand, leaned upon the &s;houlder of a lieutenant, who &s;at down for that purpo&s;e. This officer &s;eeing the French give way, exclaimed, &startq;They run! they run!&endq;&mdash;&startq;Who run?&endq; cried the gallant Wolfe, with great eagerne&s;s. When the lieutenant replied, &startq;The French.&endq;&mdash;&startq;What! (&s;aid he) do the cowards run already? then I die happy.&endq; So &s;aying, the glorious youth $$pirc$l.</NOTE>, who fell in the arms of victory, ju&s;t
as the enemy gave way. At this very in&s;tant, every &s;epa|rate
regiment of the Briti&s;h army &s;eemed to exert it&s;elf for
the honour of its own peculiar character. While the right
pre&s;&s;ed on with their bayonets, Brigadier Murray bri&s;kly
advanced with the troops under his command, and &s;oon
broke the centre of the enemy: then the Highlanders,
drawing their broad &s;words, fell in among them with irre|&s;i&s;tible
impetuo&s;ity, and drove them with great &s;laughter
into the town, and the works they had rai&s;ed at the bridge
of the river St. Charles. On the left and rear of the Eng|li&s;h,
the action was not &s;o violent. Some of the light in|fantry
had thrown them&s;elves into hou&s;es, where, being at|tacked,
they defended them&s;elves with great courage and
re&s;olution. Colonel Howe having taken po&s;t with two
companies behind a &s;mall cop&s;e, &s;allied out frequently on
the &s;lanks of the enemy, during this attack, and often
<PB N="54" REF="57">
drove them into heaps; while Brigadier Town&s;hend ad|vanced
platoons again&s;t their front: &s;o that the right
wing of the French were totally prevented from executing
their fir&s;t intention. The Brigadier him&s;elf remained with
Amher&s;t's regiment, to &s;upport this di&s;po&s;ition, and
to over-awe a body of &s;avages, po&s;ted oppo&s;ite to the
light infantry, waiting for an opportunity to fall up|on
the rear of the Briti&s;h army. General Wolfe be|ing
&s;lain, and, at the &s;ame time, Mr. Monckton dan|gerou&s;ly
wounded at the head of La&s;celles's regiment,
where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf with remarkable gallantry,
the command devolved on Brigadier Town&s;hend, who
ha&s;tened to the centre, and finding the troops di&s;ordered
in the pur&s;uit, formed them again with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition.
This nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k was &s;carce performed, when
M. de Bougainville, with a body of two thou&s;and fre&s;h
men, appeared in the rear of the Engli&s;h. He had begun
his march from Cape Rouge as &s;oon as he received intelli|gence
that the Briti&s;h troops had gained the heighhts of
Abraham, but did not come up in time to have any &s;hare
in the battle. Mr. Town&s;hend immediately ordered two
battalions, with two pieces of artillery, to advance again&s;t
this officer, who retired at their approach, among woods
and &s;wamps, where General Town&s;hend very wi&s;ely de|clined
hazarding a precarious attack. He had already ob|tained
a complete victory, taken a great number of French
officers, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very advantageous &s;ituation,
which it would have been imprudent to forego. The
French General, M. de Montcalm, was mortally wounded
in the battle, and conveyed into Quebeck, from whence,
before he died, he wrote a letter to General Town&s;hend,
recommending the pri&s;oners to that generous humanity by
which the Briti&s;h nation is di&s;tingui&s;hed. His &s;econd in
command was le$t wounded on the field, and next day ex|pired
on board an Engli&s;h &s;hip, to which he had been con|veyed.
About one thou&s;and of the enemy were made pri|&s;oners,
including a great number of officers, and about five
hundred were &s;lain on the field of battle. The wreck of
<PB N="55" REF="58">
their army, after they had re-enforced the garri&s;on of Que|beck,
retired to Point-au-Tremble, from whence they pro|ceeded
to Jaques Quartiers, where they remained en|trenched,
until they were compelled by the &s;everity of the
weather to make the be&s;t of their way to Trois Rivieres
and Montreal. This important victory was obtained at
the expen&s;e of fifty men killed, including nine officers;
and about five hundred men wounded; but the death of
General Wolfe was a national lo&s;s, univer&s;ally lamented.
He inherited from nature an animating fervour of &s;enti|ment,
an intuitive perception, an exten&s;ive capacity, and
a pa&s;&s;ion for glory, which &s;timulated him to acquire every
&s;pecies of military knowledge that &s;tudy could compre|hend,
that actual &s;ervice could illu&s;trate and confirm.
This noble warmth of di&s;po&s;ition &s;eldom fails to call forth
and unfold the liberal virtues of the &s;oul. Brave above
all e&s;timation of danger, he was al&s;o generous, gentle, com|placent,
and humane; the pattern of the officer, the darling
of the &s;oldier: there was a &s;ublimity in his genius, which
&s;oared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his
faculties been exerci&s;ed to their full extent by opportu|nity
and action; had his judgment been fully matured by
age and experience, he would, without doubt, have ri|valled
in reputation the mo&s;t celebrated captains of an|tiquity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. Immediately after the battle of Quebeck,
Admiral Saunders, who, together with his &s;ubordinates,
Durell and Holmes, had all along co-operated heartily
with the land forces for the advantage of the &s;ervice, &s;ent
up all the boats of the fleet, with artillery and ammu|nition;
and on the &s;eventeenth day of the Month &s;ailed
up, with all the &s;hips of war, in a di&s;po&s;ition to attack the
lower town, while the upper part &s;hould be a&s;&s;aulted by
General Town&s;hend. This gentleman had employed the
time from the day of action in &s;ecuring the camp with re|doubts,
in forming a military road for the cannon, in draw|ing
up the artillery, preparing batteries, and cutting off
the enemy's communication with the country. On the
<PB N="56" REF="59">
&s;eventeenth, before any battery could be fini&s;hed, a flag
of truce was &s;ent from the town, with propo&s;als of capitu|lation;
which, being maturely con&s;idered by the general
and admiral, were accepted, and &s;igned at eight next morn|ing.
They granted the more favourable terms, as the
enemy continued to a&s;&s;emble in the rear of the Briti&s;h ar|my;
as the &s;ea&s;on was become wet, &s;tormy, and cold;
threatening the troops with &s;ickne&s;s, and the &s;leet with ac|cident,
and as a con&s;iderable advantage would re&s;ult from
taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town while the walls were in a
&s;tate of de&s;ence. What rendered the capitulation &s;till
more fortunate for the Briti&s;h general, was the information
he afterwards received from de&s;erters, that the enemy had
rallied, and were re-enforced behind Cape Rouge, under
the command of M. de Levy, arrived from Montreal for
that purpo&s;e, with two regular battalions; and that M.
de Bougainville, at the head of eight hundred men, with
a convoy of provi&s;ions, was actually on his march to
throw him&s;elf into the town on the eighteenth, that very
morning on which it was &s;urrendered. The place was
not then completely inve&s;ted, as the enemy had broke
their bridge of boats, and po&s;ted detachments in very &s;trong
works, on the other &s;ide of the river St. Charles. The
capitulation was no &s;ooner ratified than the Briti&s;h forces
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Quebeck on the land &s;ide, and guards
were po&s;ted in different parts of the town, to pre&s;erve
order and di&s;cipline: at the &s;ame time, Captain Palli&s;er,
with a body of &s;eamen, entered the lower town, and took
the &s;ame precautions. Next day, about a thou&s;and pri|&s;oners
were embarked on board tran&s;ports, which pro|ceeded
to France with the fir&s;t opportunity. Mean while,
the inhabitants of the country crme in great numbers, to
deliver up their arms, and take the oath of fidelity to the
Engli&s;h government. The death of Montcalm, which
was indeed an irreparable lo&s;s to France, in all probability,
overwhelmed the enemy with con&s;ternation, and con|founded
all their councils; otherwi&s;e we cannot account
for the tame &s;urrender of Quebeck to a handful of
<PB N="57" REF="60">
troops, even after the victory they had obtained: for al|though
the place was not regularly fortified on the land
&s;ide, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es were in ruins, their walls and
parapets had not yet &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t damage: the be|&s;iegers
were hardly &s;ufficient to complete the inve&s;titure:
a fre&s;h army was a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood, with
which their communication continued open: the &s;ea&s;on
was &s;o far advanced, that the Briti&s;h forces in a little time
mu&s;t have been forced to de&s;i&s;t by the &s;everity of the wea|ther,
and even retire with their fleet before the approach
of winter, which never fails to freeze up the river St.
Laurence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Immediately after the action at the falls of
Montmorenci, General Wolfe had di&s;patched an officer to
England, with a detail of that di&s;a&s;ter, written with &s;uch
elegance and accuracy, as would not have di&s;graced the
pen of a Cae&s;ar. Though the publick acquie&s;ced in his
conduct, they were exceeding mortified at his mi&s;carriage;
and this mortification was the greater, as he &s;eemed to
de&s;pair of being able to &s;trike any other &s;troke of impor|tance
for the accompli&s;hment of their hope, which had
a&s;pired at the ab&s;olute conque&s;t of Canada. The fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of their chagrin were not yet &s;ub&s;ided, when
Colonel Hale arrived in the &s;hip Alcide, with an account
of the victory and &s;urrender of Quebeck; which was im|mediately
communicated to the people in an extraordinary
gazette. The joy which this excited among the populace
ro&s;e in proportion to the de&s;pondence which the former
had produced: all was rapture and riot; all was triumph
and exultation, mingled with the prai&s;e of the all accom|pli&s;hed
Wolfe, which they exalted to a ridiculous degree
of hyperbole. The King expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, by
conferring the honour of knighthood upon Captain Doug|las,
who&s;e &s;hip brought the fir&s;t tidings of this &s;ucce&s;s;
and gratified him and Colonel Hale with con&s;iderable
pre&s;ents. A day of &s;olemn thank&s;giving was appointed
by proclamation through all the dominions of Great-Britain.
The city of London, the univer&s;ities, and many
<PB N="58" REF="61">
other corporations of the kingdom, pre&s;ented congratu|latory
addre&s;&s;es to his Maje&s;ty. The parliament was no
&s;ooner a&s;&s;embled, than the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the Hou&s;e
of Commons, expatiated on the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the campaign,
the tran&s;cendant merit of the decea&s;ed general, the con|duct
and courage of the Admirals and officers who a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
in the conque&s;t of Quebeck. In con&s;equence of this
harangue, and the motion by which it was &s;ucceeded,
the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s,
de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty would order a monument to be erected
in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey to the memory of Major-General
Wolfe: at the &s;ame time, they pa&s;&s;ed another re&s;olution,
that the thanks of the Hou&s;e &s;hould be given to the &s;ur|viving
generals and admirals employed in the glorious
and &s;ucce&s;sful expedition to Quebeck. Te&s;timonies of
this kind, while they reflect honour upon the character
of the nation, never fail to animate individuals to a &s;pi|rited
exertion of their talents in the &s;ervice of the publick.
The people of England were &s;o elevated by the a&s;toni&s;h|ing
&s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, which was al&s;o pro&s;perous on
the continent of Europe, that far from expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t
&s;en&s;e of the enormous burthens which they bore, they,
with a &s;pirit peculiar to the Briti&s;h nation, voluntarily
rai&s;ed large contributions, to purcha&s;e warm jackets,
&s;tockings, &s;hoes, coats, and blankets, for the &s;oldiers
who were expo&s;ed to the rigours of an inclement &s;ky in
Germany and America. But they di&s;played a more noble
proof of unre&s;trained benevolence extended even to fo$s.
The French mini&s;try, &s;traitened in their finances, which
were found &s;carce &s;ufficient to maintain the war, had &s;acri|ficed
their duty to their king, and every &s;entiment of com|pa&s;&s;ion
for his unhappy &s;ubjects, to a thir&s;t of vengeance,
and &s;anguinary views of ambition. They had withdrawn
the u&s;ual allowance from their &s;ubjects who were detained
pri&s;oners in England; and tho&s;e wretched creatures,
amounting in number to near twenty thou&s;and, were left
to the mercy of tho&s;e enemies whom their &s;overeign had
taken &s;uch pains to exa&s;perate. The allowance with which
<PB N="59" REF="62">
they were indulged by the Briti&s;h government effectually
&s;ecured them from the horrors of famine; but &s;till they
remained de&s;titute of other conveniencies, and particularly
expo&s;ed to the mi&s;eries of cold and nakedne&s;s. The gene|rous
Engli&s;h beheld the&s;e forlorn captives with &s;entiments
of &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion: they con&s;idered them as
their fellow-creatures and brethren in humanity, and for|got
their country while they beheld their di&s;tre&s;s. A con|&s;iderable
&s;ub&s;cription was rai&s;ed in their behalf; and in a
few weeks they were completely clothed by the charity of
their Briti&s;h benefactors. This beneficent exertion was
certainly one of the noble&s;t triumph's of the human mind,
which even the mo&s;t inveterate enemies of Great Britain
cannot but regard with reverence and admiration. The
city of Quebeck being reduced, together with great part of
the circumjacent country, Brigadier Town&s;hend, who
had accepted his commi&s;&s;ion with the expre&s;s provi&s;o that
he &s;hould return to England at the end of the campaign,
left a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and effective men, victualled
from the fleet, under the command of Brigadier Murray;
and embarking with admiral Saunders, arrived in Great
Britain about the beginning of winter. As for Brigadier
Monckton, he was conveyed to New-York, where he
happily recovered of his wound.</P>

<P>&sect; I. WHILE the arms of Great-Britain triumphed
in Europe and America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> her intere&s;t was not
&s;uffered to langui&s;h in other parts of the world. This
was the &s;ea&s;on of ambition and activity, in which every
&s;eparate armament, every di&s;tinct corps, and every indi|vidual
officer, &s;eemed to exert them&s;elves with the mo&s;t
eager appetite of glory. The Ea&s;t-Indies, which, in the
cour&s;e of the preceding year, had been the theatre of
<PB N="62" REF="65">
operations carried on with various &s;ucce&s;s, exhibited no|thing
now but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of trophies to the Engli&s;h com|manders.
The Indian tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year we
interrupted at that period when the French general, Lally,
was employed in making preparations for the &s;iege of Ma|dras.
In the month of October he had marched into
Arcot without oppo&s;ition; and, in the beginning of De|cember,
he advanced towards Madras. On the twelfth
he marched over Choultry plain, in three divi&s;ions, can|nonaded
by the Engli&s;h artillery with con&s;iderable e$$ect,
and took po&s;t at Egmore and St. Thome. Colonel Lau|rence,
who commanded the garri&s;on of Madras, retired to
the i&s;land, in order $o prevent the enemy from taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the i&s;land bridge, and at the &s;ame time ordered the
po&s;ts to be occupied in the Black-town or &s;uburbs of Ma|dras.
In the morning of the fourteenth, the enemy march|ing
with their whole force to attack this place, the Engli&s;h
detachments retreated into the garri&s;on, and within the
hour a grand &s;ally was made, under the command of
Colonel Draper, a gallant officer, who &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf
remarkably on this occa&s;ion. He attacked the regiment of
Lorraine with great impetuo&s;ity; and, in all probability,
would have beat them off, had they not been &s;u&s;tained by
the arrival of a fre&s;h brigade. After a very warm di&s;pute,
in which many officers, and a great number of men, were
killed on each &s;ide, Colonel Draper was obliged to re|treat,
not altogether &s;atisfied with the conduct of his
grenadiers. As the garri&s;on of Madras was not very nu|merous,
nothing further was attempted on their &s;ide with|out
the works. In the mean time, the enemy u&s;ed all their
diligence in erecting batteries again&s;t the fort and
town, which being opened on the &s;ixth day of January,
they maintained a continued di&s;charge of &s;hot and &s;hells
for twenty days, advancing their trenches all the time under
cover of this fire, until they reached the brea&s;t of the glacis.
There they erected a battery of four pieces of cannon, and
opened it on the la&s;t day of the month; but for five days
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively they were obliged to clo&s;e their embra&s;ures,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
by the &s;uperior fire of the fort, and at length to abandon it
entirely; neverthele&s;s, they &s;till maintained a &s;evere fire
from the fir&s;t grand battery, which was placed at the
di&s;tance of four hundred and fifty yards from the defences.
This artillery was &s;o well &s;erved, as to di&s;able twenty &s;ix
pieces of cannon, three mortars, and effect an incon&s;ider|able
breach. Perhaps they might have had more &s;ucce&s;s,
had they battered in breach from the beginning; but
M. Lally, in order to intimidate the inhabitants, had
cruelly bombarded the town, and demoli&s;hed the hou&s;es:
he was, however, happily di&s;appointed in his expectation
by the wi&s;e and re&s;olute precautions of Governour Pigot:
by the vigilance, conduct, and bravery of the Colonels
Laurence and Draper, &s;econded by the valour and activity
of Major Brereton, and the &s;pirit of the inferior officers.
The artillery of the garri&s;on was &s;o well managed, that,
from the fifth day of February, the fire of the enemy
gradually decrea&s;ed from twenty-three to &s;ix pieces of can|non:
neverthele&s;s, they advanced their &s;ap along the &s;ea|&s;ide,
&s;o as to embrace entirely the north-ea&s;t angle of the
covered way, from whence their mu&s;quetry drove the be|&s;ieged.
They likewi&s;e endeavoured to open a pa&s;&s;age into
the ditch by a mine, but &s;prung it &s;o injudiciou&s;ly, that
they could make no advantage of it, as it lay expo&s;ed to
the fire of &s;everal cannon. While the&s;e preparations were
carried on before the town, Major Caillaud and Captain
Pre&s;ton, with a body of Sipoys, &s;ome of the country hor&s;e,
and a few Europeans, drawn from the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons
of Trichenapally and Chingalaput, hovered at the di&s;tance
of a few miles, blocking up the roads in &s;uch a manner,
that the enemy were obliged, four &s;everal times, to &s;end
large detachments again&s;t them, in order to open the com|munication:
thus the progre&s;s of the &s;iege was in a great
mea&s;ure retarded. On the &s;ixteenth day of February in
the evening, the Queenborough &s;hip of war commanded
by Captain Kempenfeldt, and the company's &s;hip the Re|venge,
arrived in the road of Madras, with a re-enforce|ment
of &s;ix hundred men belonging to Colonel Draper's
<PB N="64" REF="67">
regiment, and part of them was immediately di&s;embarked.
From the beginning of the &s;iege, the enemy had di&s;covered
a backwardne&s;s in the &s;ervice very un&s;uitable to their
national character. They were ill &s;upplied by their com|mi&s;&s;aries
and contractors: they were di&s;couraged by the
ob&s;tinate defence of the garri&s;on, and all their hope of &s;uc|ce&s;s
vani&s;hed at the arrival of this re-enforcement. After
a bri&s;k fire, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege that very night, abandon|ing
forty pieces of cannon; and, having de&s;troyed the
powder-mills at Ogmore, retreated to the territory of
Arcot<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The chagrin and mortification of Lally are &s;trongly marked in the $$lowing intercepted letter to M. de Legret, dated from the camp $word$ Madras: &startq;A good blow might be &s;truck here; there is a &s;hip in the $word$ twenty guns, laden with all the riches of Madras, which it is &s;aid will $word$ main there till the 20th.

&sect; II. M. Lally having weakened his forces that were at
Ma&s;ulipatam, under the conduct of the Marquis de Con|ans,
in order to &s;trengthen the army with which he un|dertook
the &s;iege of Madras, the Rajah of Vi&s;anapore
drove the French garri&s;on from Vizagapatam, and hoi&s;ted
Engli&s;h colours in the place. The Marquis having put
his troops in motion to revenge this in&s;ult, the Rajah
&s;ollicited &s;uccour from Colonel Clive at Calcutta; and,
with the con&s;ent of the council, a body of troops was &s;ent,
under the command of Colonel Forde, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
They con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred Europeans, including a
company of artillery, and &s;ixteen hundred &s;ipoys, with
about fifteen pieces of cannon, one howitzer, and three
mortars. The forces of Conflans were much more con|&s;iderable.
On the twentieth day of October, Colonel
Forde arrived at Vizagapatam, and made an agreement
with the Rajah, who promi&s;ed to pay the expen&s;e of the
expedition, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Rajamundry, a large town and fort po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
French. It was &s;tipulated that he &s;hould have all the in|land
<PB N="66" REF="69">
country belonging to the Indian powers in the French
intere&s;t, and at pre&s;ent in arms; and that the Engli&s;h com|pany
&s;hould retain all the conquered &s;ea-coa&s;t from Viza|gapatam
to Ma&s;ulipatam. On the fir&s;t day of November
Colonel Forde proceeded on his march, and on the third
joined the Rajah's army, con&s;i&s;ting of between three and
four thou&s;and men. On the third day of December they
came in fight of the enemy, near the village of Tallapool:
but the French declining battle, the Colonel determined
to draw them from their advantageous &s;ituation, or march
round, and get between them and Rajamundry. On the
&s;eventh, before day-break, he began his march, leaving
the Rajah's forces on their ground; but the enemy be|ginning
to cannonade the Indian forces, he, at the reque&s;t
of the Rajah, returned, and took them under his pro|tection.
Then they marched together to the village of
Golapool, and halted on a &s;mall plain about three miles from
their encampment. About nine he formed the line of bat|tle.
About ten the enemy were drawn up, and began the
cannonade. The firing on both &s;ides having continued
about forty minutes, the enemy's line advanced to the
charge with great re&s;olution, and were &s;o warmly received,
that after &s;everal &s;pirited efforts, at eleven they gave way,
and retreated in di&s;order towards Rajamundry. During
this conflict, the Rajah's forces &s;tood as idle &s;pectators;
$or could their hor&s;e be prevailed upon to pur&s;ue the fugi|tives.
This victory co&s;t the Engli&s;h forty-four Europeans
killed and wounded, including two captains and three
lieutenants. The French lo&s;t above three times the num|ber,
together with their whole camp, baggage, thirty-two
pieces of cannon, and all their ammunition. A great num|ber
of black forces fell on both &s;ides. The Marquis $word$
Con$lans did not remain at Rajamundry, but proceeded to
Ma&s;ulipatam; while Captain Knox, with a detachment
from the Engli&s;h army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ort of Raja|mundry,
which is the barrier and key to the country of
Vizagapatam. This was delivered to the Rajah on his
paying the expen&s;e of the expedition; and Captain Knox
<PB N="67" REF="70">
being detached with a battalion of &s;ipoys, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the French factory at Nar&s;ipore. This was al&s;o the fate
of a &s;mall fort at Coucate, which &s;urrendered to Cap|tain
Maclean, after having made an ob&s;tinate defence.
In the mean time, however, the French army of ob&s;erva|tion
made &s;hift to retake Rajamundry, where they found
a con&s;iderable quantity of money, baggage, and effects be|longing
to Engli&s;h officers.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Colonel Forde advancing to the neighbourhood
of Ma&s;ulipatam, the Marquis de Conflans with his forces
retired within the place, which on the &s;eventh day of
March was inve&s;ted. By the &s;eventh day of April the
ammunition of the be&s;iegers being almo&s;t expended, Col.
Forde determined to give the a&s;&s;ault, as two breaches
were already made, and made his di&s;po&s;ition accordingly.
The attack was begun in the night, and the a&s;&s;ailants ar|rived
at the ditch before they were di&s;covered. But here they
under went a terrible di&s;charge of grape-&s;hot and mu&s;quetry;
notwith&s;tanding which they entered the breaches, and drove
the enemy from ba&s;tion to ba&s;tion. At length, the Mar|quis
de Conflans &s;ent an officer to demand quarter for the
garri&s;on, which was granted as &s;oon as he ordered his men
to cea&s;e firing. Thus, with about three hundred and
forty European &s;oldiers, a handful of &s;eamen, and &s;even
hundred &s;ipoys, Colonel Forde took by a&s;&s;ault the &s;trong
town of Ma&s;ulipatam, garri&s;oned by five hundred and
twenty-two Europeans, two thou&s;and and thirty-nine
caffrees, topa&s;&s;es, and &s;ipoys; and here he found above one
hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, with a great quantity
of ammunition. Salabatzing, the Subah of Decan, per|ceiving
the &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h here as well as at Ma|dras,
being &s;ick of his French alliance, and in dread of
his brother Nizam Allee, who had &s;et up a &s;eparate in|tere&s;t,
and taken the field again&s;t him, made advances to
the company, with which he forth with concluded a treaty
to the following effect:&mdash;&startq;The whole of the circar of Ma|&s;ulipatam
&s;hall be given to the Engli&s;h company. Sala|batzing
will not &s;uffer the French to have a &s;ettlement in
<PB N="68" REF="71">
this country, nor keep them in his &s;ervice, nor give them
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Engli&s;h, on their part, will not a&s;&s;i&s;t,
nor give protection to the Subah's enemies.&endq; In a few
days after Ma&s;ulipatam was reduced, two &s;hips arrived in
the road, with a re-enforcement of four hundred men to
the Marquis de Conflans; but under&s;tanding the fate of
the place, made the be&s;t of their way to Ganjam.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The merchants re&s;iding at Surat, finding them|&s;elves
expo&s;ed to numberle&s;s dangers, and every &s;pecies of
oppre&s;&s;ion, by the Sidee who commanded the ca&s;tle, on
one hand, by the governor of the city on the other, and
by the Mahrattas, who had a claim to a certain &s;hare of
the revenue, made application to the Engli&s;h pre&s;idency at
Bombay, de&s;iring they would equip an expedition for
taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle and Tanka, and &s;ettle the
government of the city upon Pharafs Cawn, who had been
naib or deputy-governor under Meah Atchund, and re|gulated
the police to the &s;atisfaction of the inhabitants.
The pre&s;idency embraced the propo&s;al: Admiral Pococke
&s;pared two of his &s;hips for this &s;ervice. Eight hundred
and fifty men, artillery and infantry, with fifteen hundred
&s;ipoys, under the command of Captain Richard Maitland,
of the royal regiment of artillery, were embarked on board
the company's armed ve&s;&s;els commanded by Captain Wat|&s;on,
who &s;ailed on the ninth day of February. On the fif|teenth,
they were landed at a place called Dentiloury,
about nine miles from Surat; and here they were encamp|ed
for refre&s;hment: in two days he advanced again&s;t the
French garden, in which a con&s;iderable number of the
Sidee's men were po&s;ted, and drove them from thence,
after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute. Then he erected a battery,
from which he battered the wall in breach: but this me|thod
appearing tedious, he called a council of war, com|po&s;ed
of the land and &s;ea-officers, and laid before them the
plan of a general attack, which was accordingly executed
next morning. The company's grab, and the bomb|ketches,
being warped up the river in the night, were
ranged in a line of battle oppo&s;ite to the Bundar, which
<PB N="69" REF="72">
was the &s;tronge&s;t fortification that the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and under the fire of the&s;e, the troops being landed, took
the Bundar by a&s;&s;ault. The outward town being thus
gained, he forthwith began to bombard the inner town
and ca&s;tle with &s;uch fury, that next morning they both
&s;urrendered, on condition of being allowed to march
out with their effects; and Captain Maitland took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
without further di&s;pute. Meah Atchund was conti|nued
governor of Surat, and Phara&s;s Cawn was appointed
naib. The artillery and ammunition found in the ca&s;tle
were &s;ecured for the company, until the Mogul's plea&s;ure
was known; and in a little time a phirmaund, or grant,
arrived from Delhi, appointing the Engli&s;h company ad|miral
to the Mogul; &s;o that the &s;hips and &s;tores belonged
to them of cour&s;e, as part of the Tanka; and they were
now declared legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the ca&s;tle. This conque&s;t,
which co&s;t about two hundred men, including a few offi|cers,
was atchieved with &s;uch expedition, that Captain
Wat&s;on returned to Bombay by the ninth day of April.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The main body of the Engli&s;h forces, which had
been centered at Madras, for the pre&s;ervation of that im|portant
&s;ettlement, took the &s;ield after the &s;iege was
rai&s;ed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Conjeveram, a place of
great con&s;equence, which, with the fort of Schengelpel,
commanded all the adjacent country, and &s;ecured the Bri|ti&s;h
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the northward. M. Lally, &s;en&s;ible of
the importance of the po&s;t, took the &s;ame route, in order
to di&s;lodge them; but finding all his attempts ineffectual,
he retired towards Wandewa&s;h, where his troops were
put into quarters of cantonment. No other operations
en&s;ued till the month of September, when Major Brereton,
who commanded the Engli&s;h forces, being joined by Ma|jor
Gordon with three hundred men of Col. Coote's bat|talion,
re&s;olved to attack the enemy in his turn. On the
fourteenth day of the month he began his march from
Conjeveram for Wandewa&s;h, at the head of four hundred
Europeans, &s;even thou&s;and &s;ipoys, &s;eventy European,
and three hundred black hor&s;e, with fourteen pieces
<PB N="70" REF="73">
of artillery. In his march he inve&s;ted and took the fort of
Trivitar, from whence he proceeded to the village of
Wandewa&s;h, where the French, to the number of one
thou&s;and, were &s;trongly encamped under the guns of a fort
commanded by a Rajah, mounting twenty cannon, under
the direction of a French gunner. On the thirtieth day
of September, at two in the morning, the Engli&s;h at|tacked
the village in three different places, and drove them
from it after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute; but this advantage
they were not able to maintain. The black pioneers ran
away during the attack, &s;o that proper traver&s;es could
not be made in the &s;treets; and at day-break the fort
poured in upon them a prodigious di&s;charge of grape-&s;hot
with a con&s;iderable effect. The enemy had retired to a
dry ditch, which &s;erved as an entrenchment, from whence
they made furious &s;allies; and a body of three hundred
European hor&s;e were already in motion, to fall upon and
complete their confu&s;ion. In this emergency, they retired
in di&s;order, and might have been entirely ruined, had not
the body of re&s;erve effectually covered their retreat; yet
this could not be effected without the lo&s;s of &s;everal offi|cers,
and above three hundred men killed and wounded.
After this mortifying check, they encamped a few days
in &s;ight of the fort, and the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;etting in, re|turned
to Conjeveram. The fort of Wandewa&s;h was
afterwards garri&s;oned by French and &s;ipoys, and the other
forces of the enemy were a&s;&s;embled by Brigadier-General
de Bu&s;&s;y at Arcot.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. During the&s;e tran&s;actions by land, the &s;uperiority
at &s;ea was &s;till di&s;puted between the Engli&s;h and French
admirals. On the fir&s;t day of September, Vice-Admiral
Pococke &s;ailed from Madras to the &s;outhward, in que&s;t of
the enemy; and next day de&s;cried the French fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting
of fifteen &s;ail, &s;tanding to the northward. He forth|with
threw out the &s;ignal for a general cha&s;e, and &s;tood
towards them with all the &s;ail he could carry; but the
wind abating, he could not approach near enough to en$gage.
During the three &s;ucceeding days, he u&s;ed his ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="74">
endeavours to bring them to a battle, which they
&s;till declined, and at la&s;t they di&s;appeared. He then di|rected
his cour&s;e to Pondicherry, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
they were bound to that harbour; and on the eighth day
of the month perceived them &s;tanding to the &s;outhward:
but he could not bring them to an engagement till the
tenth, when M. d'Apch$, about two in the afternoon, made
the &s;ignal for battle, and the cannonading began without
further delay. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron did not exceed nine
&s;hips of the line; the enemy's fleet con&s;i&s;ted of eleven; but
they had &s;till a greater advantage in number of men and
artillery. Both &s;quadrons fought with great impetuo&s;ity
till about ten minutes after four, when the enemy's rear
began to give way: this example was &s;oon followed by
their centre; and finally the van, with the whole &s;qua|dron,
bore to the &s;outh-&s;outh-ea&s;t, with all the canvas
they could &s;pread. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron was &s;o much
damaged in their ma&s;ts and rigging, that they could
not pur&s;ue; &s;o that M. d'Apch$ retreated at his lei&s;ure un|mole&s;ted.
On the fifteenth, Admiral Pococke returned to
Madras, where his &s;quadron being repaired by the twenty-&s;ixth,
he &s;ailed again to Pondicherry, and in the road &s;aw
the enemy lying at anchor in line of battle. The wind
being off &s;hore, he made the line of battle a-head, and
for &s;ome time continued in this &s;ituation. At length the
French admiral weighed anchor, and came forth; but
in&s;tead of bearing down upon the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, which
had fallen to leeward, he kept clo&s;e to the wind,
and &s;tretched away to the &s;outhward. Admiral Pococke
finding him aver&s;e to another engagement, and his own
&s;quadron being in no condition to pur&s;ue, he, with the
advice of his captains, de&s;i&s;ted, and mea&s;ured back his
cour&s;e to Madras. On the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, above
three hundred men were killed in the engagement, in|cluding
Captain Miche, who commanded the Newca&s;tle,
Captain Core of the marines, two lieutenants, a ma&s;ter,
gunner, and boat&s;wain: the Captains Somer&s;et and Brere|ton,
with about two hundred and fifty men, were wound|ed,
<PB N="72" REF="75">
and many of the &s;hips con&s;iderably damaged. The
lo&s;s of the enemy mu&s;t have been much more con&s;iderable;
becau&s;e the Engli&s;h in battle always fire at the body of the
&s;hip; becau&s;e the French &s;quadron was crowded with
men; becau&s;e they gave way, and declined a &s;econd en|gagement;
and finally, becau&s;e they now made the be&s;t
of their way to the i&s;land of Mauritius, in order to be re|fitted,
having on board General Lally, and &s;ome other
officers. Thus they left the Engli&s;h ma&s;ters of the Indian
coa&s;t; a &s;uperiority &s;till more confirmed by the arrival of
Rear-Admiral Corni&s;h, with four &s;hips of the line, who
had &s;et &s;ail from England in the beginning of the year,
and joined Admiral Pococke at Madras on the eighteenth
day of October.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The French were not the only enemies with
whom the Engli&s;h had to cope in the Ea&s;t-Indies. The
great exten&s;ion of their trade in the kingdom of Bengal
had excited the envy and avarice of the Dutch factory,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;trong fort at Chinchura, on the river of
Bengal; and re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to engro&s;s the whole
&s;alt-petre branch of commerce. They had, without doubt,
tampered with the new Subah, who lay under &s;uch obli|gations
to the Engli&s;h, and probably &s;ecured his conni|vance.
Their &s;cheme was approved by the governor of
Batavia, who charged him&s;elf with the execution of it;
and, for that purpo&s;e, cho&s;e the opportunity when
the Briti&s;h &s;quadron had retired to the coa&s;t of Ma|labar.
On pretence of re-enforcing the Dutch garri&s;ons
in Bengal, he equipped an armament of &s;even &s;hips,
having on board five hundred European troops, and &s;ix
hundred Malaye&s;e under the command of Colonel Ru&s;&s;el.
This armament having touched at Negapatam, proceeded
up the bay, and arrived in the river of Bengal about the
beginning of October. Colonel Clive, who then re&s;ided
at Calcutta, had received information of their de&s;ign,
which he was re&s;olved, at all events, to defeat. He com|plained
to the Subah, who, upon &s;uch application, could
not decently refu&s;e an order to the director and council of
<PB N="73" REF="76">
Hughley, that this armament &s;hould not pro|ceed
up the river. The Colonel, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent a
letter to the Dutch commodore, intimating, that as he
had received intimation of their de&s;ign, he could not allow
them to land forces, and march to Chinchura. In an&s;wer
to this declaration, the Dutch commodore, who&s;e whole fleet
had not yet arrived, a&s;&s;ured the Engli&s;h commander that
he had no intention to &s;end any forces to Chinchura;
and begged liberty to land &s;ome of his troops for refre&s;h|ment;
a favour that was granted, on condition that they
&s;hould not advance. Notwith&s;tanding the Subah's order,
and his own engagement to this effect, the re&s;t of the &s;hips
were no &s;ooner arrived, than he proceeded up the river to
the neighbourhood of Tannah-fort, where his forces being
di&s;embarked, began their march to Chinchura. In the
mean time, by way of retaliating the affront he pretended
to have &s;u&s;tained, in being denied a pa&s;&s;age to their own
factory, he took &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els on the river belong|ing
to the Engli&s;h company; and the Calcutta Indiaman,
commanded by Captain Wil&s;on, homeward-bound, &s;ailing
down the river, the Dutchman gave him to under&s;tand,
that if he pre&s;umed to pa&s;s he would &s;ink him without
further ceremony. The Engli&s;h captain &s;eeing them
run out their guns, as if really re&s;olved to put their threats
in execution, returned to Calcutta, where two other In|dia
&s;hips lay at anchor, and reported his adventure to Co|lonel
Clive, who forthwith ordered the three &s;hips to pre|pare
for battle, and attack the Dutch armament. The
&s;hips being properly manned, and their quarters lined
with &s;alt-petre, they fell down the river, and found the
Dutch &s;quadron drawn up in line of battle, in order to
give them a warm reception, for which indeed they &s;eemed
well prepared: for three of them were mounted with thir|ty-&s;ix
guns each; three of them with twenty-&s;ix, and the
&s;eventh carried &s;ixteen. The Duke of Dor&s;et, com|manded
by Captain Forre&s;ter, being the fir&s;t that ap|proached
them, dropped anchor clo&s;e to their line, and be|gan
the engagement with a broad&s;ide, which was imme|diately
<PB N="74" REF="77">
returned. A dead calm unfortunately intervening,
this &s;ingle &s;hip was for a con&s;iderable time expo&s;ed to the
whole fire of the enemy; but a &s;mall breeze &s;pringing up,
the Calcutta and the Hardwicke advanced to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and a &s;evere fire was maintained on both &s;ides, till two of
the Dutch &s;hips, &s;lipping their cables, bore away, and a
third was driven a&s;hore. Their commodore thus weak|ened,
after a few broad&s;ides, &s;truck his flag to Captain
Wil&s;on, and the other three followed his example. The
victory being thus obtained, without the lo&s;s of one man
on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, Captain Wil&s;on took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the prizes, the decks of which were &s;trewed with car|nage,
and &s;ent the pri&s;oners to Colonel Clive, at Calcutta.
The detachment of troops which they had landed, to the
number of eleven hundred men, was not more fort$$$te
in their progre&s;s. Colonel Clive no &s;ooner received intel|ligence
that they were in full march to Chinchura than
he detached Colonel Forde, with five hundred men, from
Calcutta, in order to oppo&s;e, and put a &s;top to their march
at the French gardens. He accordingly advanced to the
northward, and entered the town of Chandernagore,
where he &s;u&s;tained the fire of a Dutch party &s;ent out from
Chinchura to join and conduct the expected re-enforce|ment.
The&s;e being routed and di&s;per&s;ed, after a &s;hort
action, Colonel Forde in the morning proceeded to a plain
in the neighbourhood of Chinchura, where he found the
enemy prepared to give him battle, on the twenty-fifth
day of November. They even advanced to the charge
with great re&s;olution and activity; but found the fire of
the Engli&s;h artillery and battalion &s;o intolerably hot, that
they &s;oon gave way, and were totally defeated. A con|&s;iderable
number were killed, and the greater part of tho&s;e
who &s;urvived the action were taken pri&s;oners. During
this conte&s;t, the Nabob, at the head of a con&s;iderable army,
ob&s;erved a &s;u&s;picious neutrality; and in all likelihood
would have declared for the Dutch, had they proved
victorious, as he had rea&s;on to believe they would, from
their great &s;uperiority in number. But fortune no &s;ooner
<PB N="75" REF="78">
determined in favour of the Engli&s;h than he made a tender
of his &s;ervice to the victor, and even offered to reduce
Chinchura with his own army. In the mean time, pro|po&s;als
of accommodation being &s;ent to him by the directors
and council of the Dutch factory at Chinchura, a nego|ciation
en&s;ued, and a treaty was concluded to the &s;atis|faction
of all parties. Above three hundred of the pri|&s;oners
entered into the &s;ervice of Great-Britain: the re&s;t
embarked on board their &s;hips, which were re&s;tored as
&s;oon as the peace was ratified, and &s;et out on their return
for Batavia. After all, perhaps, the Dutch company meant
nothing more than to put their factory of Chinchura on a
more re&s;pectable footing; and, by acquiring greater weight
and con&s;equence among the people of the country than
they formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the more ea&s;ily extend their com|merce
in that part of the world. At any rate, it will
admit of a di&s;pute among tho&s;e who profe&s;s the law of
nature and nations, whether the Dutch company could be
ju&s;tly debarred the privilege of &s;ending a re-enforcement
to their own garri&s;ons. Be that as it will, the &s;hips were
not re&s;tored until the factory at Chinchura had given &s;e|curity
to indemnify the Engli&s;h for the damage they had
&s;u&s;tained on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h company was &s;till
more con&s;picuous on the coa&s;t of Coromandel. The go|vernour
and council of Madras having received informa|tion,
that the French General Lally had &s;ent a detachment
of his army to the &s;outhward, taken Syringham, and
threatned Trichenapally with a &s;iege, it was determined
the Colonel Coo$e, who had lately arrived from England,
&s;hould take the field, and endeavour to make a diver&s;ion
to the &s;outhward. He accordingly began his march at the
head of &s;eventeen hundred Europeans, including cavalry,
and three thou&s;and blacks, with fourteen pieces of cannon
and one howitzer. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of Novem|ber
he inve&s;ted the &s;ort of Wandewa&s;h: having made a
practicable breach, the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of near nine
hundred men, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war; and he found
<PB N="76" REF="79">
in the place forty-nine pieces of cannon, with a great
quantity of ammunition. Then he undertook the &s;iege of
Carangoly, a fortre&s;s commanded by Colonel O'Kennely,
at the head of one hundred Europeans, and five hundred
&s;ipoys. In a few days he di&s;mounted the greater part of
their guns; and they &s;ubmitted, on condition that the
Europeans &s;hould be allowed to march out with the ho|nours
of war, but the &s;ipoys were di&s;armed, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. General Lally, alarmed at the progre&s;s of this
brave, vigilant, and enterpri&s;ing officer, a&s;&s;embled all his
forces at Arcot, to the number of two thou&s;and two hun|dred
Europeans, including hor&s;e, three hundred Caffres,
and ten thou&s;and black troops, or &s;ipoys, with five-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. Of the&s;e he a&s;&s;umed the com|mand
in per&s;on; and on the tenth day of January began
his march, in order to recover Wandewa&s;h. Colonel
Coote, having received intelligence on the twelfth that he
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Conjeveram, endeavoured by $word$
forced march to &s;ave the place, which they accordingly
abandoned at his approach, and pur&s;uing their march $word$
Wandewa&s;h, inve&s;ted the fort without delay. The Eng|li&s;h
commander pa&s;&s;ed the river Palla, in order to follow the
&s;ame route; and, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of the month,
under&s;tanding that a breach was already made, re&s;olved to
give them battle without further delay. The cavalry
being formed, and &s;upported by five companies of &s;ipoy$
he advanced again&s;t the enemy's hor&s;e, which being $word$
the &s;ame time galled by two pieces of cannon, retired with
precipitation. Then Colonel Coote, having taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a tank which they had occupied, returned to the
line, which was by this time formed in order of battle&punc;
Seeing the men in high &s;pirits, and eager to engage, $word$
ordered the whole army to advance, and by nine in the
morning they were within two miles of the enemy's camp&punc;
where they halted about half an hour. During this $$|terval,
the Colonel reconnoitred the &s;ituation of the French
forces, who were very advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, and made $word$
<PB N="77" REF="80">
movement to the right,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> which obliged them to alter their
di&s;po&s;ition. They now advanced, in their turn, within
three quarters of a mile of the Engli&s;h line, and the can|nonading
began with great fury on both &s;ides. About
noon their European cavalry coming up with a re&s;olute
air to charge the left of the Engli&s;h, Colonel Coote brought
up &s;ome companies of &s;ipoys, and two pieces of cannon,
to &s;u&s;tain the hor&s;e, which were ordered to oppo&s;e them,
and the&s;e advancing on their flank, di&s;turbed them &s;o
much, that they broke, and were driven by the Engli&s;h
cavalry above a mile from the left, upon the rear of their
own army. Mean while, both lines continued advancing
to each other, and about one o'clock the firing with &s;mall
arms began with great vivacity. One of the French
tumbrils being blown up by an accidental &s;hot, the Eng|li&s;h
commander took immediate advantage of their confu|&s;ion.
He ordered Major Brereton to wheel Draper's re|giment
to the left, and fall upon the enemy's flank. This
&s;ervice was performed with &s;uch re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s,
that the left wing of the French was completely routed,
and fell upon their centre, now clo&s;ely engaged with the
left of the Engli&s;h. About two in the afternoon their
whole line gave way, and fled towards their own camp,
which, perceiving them&s;elves clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, they preci|pitately
abandoned, together with twenty-two pieces of
cannon. In this engagement they lo&s;t about eight hun|dred
men killed and wounded, be&s;ides about fifty pri&s;oners,
including Brigadier-General de Bu&s;&s;y, the Chevalier
Godeville, quarter-ma&s;ter-general, Lieutenant Colonel
Murphy, three captains, five lieutenants, and &s;ome other
officers. On the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h two hundred and &s;ix|ty-two
were killed or wounded, and among the former
the gallant and accompli&s;hed Major Brereton, who&s;e
death was a real lo&s;s to his country.</P>
<P>&sect; X. General Lally having retreated with his broken
troops to Pondicherry, the Baron de Va&s;&s;erot was detach|ed
towards the &s;ame place, with a thou&s;and hor&s;e and
three hundred &s;ipoys, to ravage and lay wa&s;te the French
<PB N="78" REF="81">
territory. In the mean time, the indefatigable Colonel
Coote undertook the &s;iege of Chilliput, which in two days
was &s;urrendered by the Chevalier de Tilly, him&s;elf and
his garri&s;on remaining pri&s;oners of war. Such al&s;o was
the fate of fort Timmery, which being reduced, the Co|lonel
pro&s;ecuted his march to Arcot, the capital of the
province, again&s;t the fort of which he opened his batterie$
on the fifth day of February. When he had carried on
his approaches within &s;ixty yards of the cre&s;t of the gla$$,
the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and fifty Euro|peans,
and near three hundred &s;ipoys, &s;urrendered as pri|&s;oners
of war, and here the Engli&s;h commander found
two-and-twenty pieces of cannon, four mortars, and a
great quantity of all kinds of military &s;tores. Thus the
campaign was gloriou&s;ly fini&s;hed with the conque&s;t of
Arcot, after the French army had been routed and ruined
by the diligence of Colonel Coote, who&s;e courage, con|duct,
and activity cannot be &s;ufficiently admired. The
reader will perceive, that, rather than interrupt the thre$$
of &s;uch an intere&s;ting narration, we have ventured to $word$
croach upon the annals of the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and &s;ixty.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Having thus followed the Briti&s;h banners through
the glorious tracts they pur&s;ued in different parts of A&s;ia
and America, we mu&s;t now convert our attention to the
continent of Europe, where the Engli&s;h arms, in the
cour&s;e of this year, triumphed with equal lu&s;tre and ad$$$|tage.
But fir&s;t it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ketch out the &s;itua|tions
in which the belligerent powers were found at the
clo&s;e of winter. The vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune with which
the preceeding campaign had been chequered were &s;uf$i$i|ent
to convince every potentate concerned in the war, they
neither &s;ide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;uperiority in &s;trength $word$
conduct as was requi&s;ite to impo&s;e terms upon the $word$
Battles had been fought with various &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;ur|pri&s;ing
efforts of military &s;kill had been exhibited, with|out
producing one event which tended to promote a ge|neral
peace, or even engender the lea&s;t de&s;ire of ac|commodation;
<PB N="79" REF="82">
on the contrary, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t violent
tran&s;ports of animo&s;ity had by this time &s;ub&s;ided into a
confirmed habit of deliberate hatred, and every contending
power &s;eemed more than ever determined to protract the
di&s;pute, while the neutral &s;tates kept aloof, without ex|pre&s;&s;ing
the lea&s;t de&s;ire of interpo&s;ing their mediation.
Some of them were re&s;trained by con&s;iderations of conve|niency;
and others waited in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for the death of
the Spani&s;h monarch, as an event which they imagined
would be attended with very important con&s;equences in
the &s;outhern parts of Europe. With re&s;pect to the main|tenance
of the war, whatever difficulties might have ari|&s;en
in &s;ettling funds to &s;upport the expen&s;e, and finding
men to recruit the different armies, certain it is all the&s;e
difficulties were &s;urmounted before the opening of the
campaign. The court of Vienna, though hampered by the
narrowne&s;s of its finances, &s;till found re&s;ources in the fer|tility
of its provinces, in the number and attachment of
its &s;ubjects, who, more than any other people in Europe,
acquie&s;ce in the di&s;po&s;itions of their &s;overeign; and, when
pay cannot be afforded, willingly contribute free quarters
for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army. The Czarina, though &s;he
complained that the &s;tipulated &s;ub&s;idies were ill paid, ne|verthele&s;s
per&s;i&s;ted in pur&s;uing tho&s;e favourite aims which
had for &s;ome time influenced her conduct; namely, her
per&s;onal animo&s;ity to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and her de&s;ire
of obtaining a permanent intere&s;t in the German empire.
Sweden &s;till made a &s;how of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch, but continued to &s;lumber over the engage|ments
&s;he had contracted. France, exhau&s;ted in her fi|nances,
and abridged of her marine commerce, maintained
a re&s;olute countenance, &s;upplied fre&s;h armies for her ope|rations
in We&s;tphalia, projected new &s;chemes of conque&s;t,
and cajoled her allies with fair promi&s;es, when &s;he had
nothing more &s;olid to be&s;tow. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's
dominions were generally drained, or in the hands
of the enemy; but, to balance the&s;e di&s;advantages, he
kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony, and enjoyed his annual
<PB N="80" REF="83">
&s;ub&s;idy from Great-Britain, which effectually enabled $word$
to maintain his armies on a re&s;pectable footing, and open
the campaign with equal eagerne&s;s and confidence.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The Hanoverian army commanded by Prince
Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, was &s;trengthened by fre&s;h re-enforcements
from England, augmented with German
recruits, regularly paid, and well &s;upplied with every com|fort
and convenience which fore&s;ight could &s;ugge&s;t, or
money procure; yet, in &s;pite of all the precautions that
could be taken, they were cut off from &s;ome re&s;ources
which the French, in the beginning of the year, opened
to them&s;elves by a flagrant &s;troke of perfidy, which even
the extreme nece&s;&s;ities of a campaign can hardly excu&s;e.
On the &s;econd day of January, the French regiment of
Na&s;&s;au pre&s;enting it&s;elf before the gates of Franckfort on
the Maine, a neutral imperial city, and demanding a pa&s;|&s;age,
it was introduced, and conducted by a detachment
of the garri&s;on through the city, as far as the gate of S$x|en-hau&s;en,
where it unexpectedly halted, and immediately
di&s;armed the guards. Before the inhabitants could reco|ver
from the con&s;ternation into which they were thrown
by this outrageous in&s;ult, five other French regiment&punc;en|tered
the place, and here their general, the Prince $word$
Soubi&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed his head quarters. How deeply &s;o|ever
this violation of the laws of the Empire might be re|&s;ented
by all hone&s;t Germans, who retained affection
for the con&s;titutions of their country, it was a &s;tep from
which the French army derived a very manife&s;t and im|portant
advantage; for it &s;ecured to them the cour&s;e $word$
the Maine and the Upper Rhine; by which they receiv|ed,
without difficulty or danger, every &s;pecies of &s;up|ply
from Mentz, Spire, Worms, and even the coun|try
of Al&s;ace; while it maintained their communicati|on
with the chain formed by the Au&s;trian forces and the
army of the Empire.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The &s;cheme of operations for the en&s;uing cam|paign
was already formed between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and
Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick; and before the $word$
<PB N="81" REF="84">
took the field &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought, and quarters
&s;urpri&s;ed. In the latter end of February, the Prince of
Y&s;embourg detached Major-General Ur&s;t with four bat|talions
and a body of hor&s;e, who, a&s;&s;embling at Rhoten|bourg,
&s;urpri&s;ed the enemy's quarters in the night between
the fir&s;t and &s;econd day of March, and drove them from
Hirchfield, Vacha, and all the He&s;&s;ian bailiwicks of
which they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but the Au&s;trians &s;oon
returning in greater numbers, and being &s;upported by a
detachment of French troops from Franckfort, the allies
fell back in their turn. In a few days, however, they them|&s;elves
retreated again with great precipitation, though
they did not all e&s;cape. The Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;|wick,
with a body of Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, fell upon them &s;ud|denly
at Molrich&s;tadt, where he routed and di&s;per&s;ed a
regiment of Hohenzollern cuira&s;&s;iers, and a battalion of
the troops of Wurtzburg. He next day, which was the
fir&s;t of April, advanced with a body of hor&s;e and foot to
Meinungen, where he found a con&s;iderable magazine,
took two battalions pri&s;oners, and &s;urpri&s;ed a third po&s;ted
at Wafungen, after having defeated &s;ome Au&s;trian troops
that were on the march to its relief. While the Heredi|tary
Prince was thus employed, the Duke of Hol&s;tein,
with another body of the confederates, di&s;lodged the
French from the po&s;t of Freyin&s;tenau.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. But the great object was to drive the enemy
from Franckfort, before they &s;hould receive the expected
re-enforcements. Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, being
determined upon this enterpri&s;e, a&s;&s;embled all his forces
near Fulda, to the amount of forty thou&s;and choice troops,
and began his march on the tenth day of April. On the
thirteenth he came in &s;ight of the enemy, whom he found
&s;trongly encamped about the village of Bergen, between
Franckfort and Hanau. Their general, the Duke de Brog|lio,
counted one of the be&s;t officers in France with re|&s;pect
to conduct and intrepidity, having received intelli|gence
of the Prince's de&s;ign, occupied this po&s;t on the
twelfth, the right of his army being at Bergen, and his
<PB N="82" REF="85">
centre and flanks &s;ecured in &s;uch a manner, that the
allies could not make their attack any other way but by
the village. Notwith&s;tanding the advantage of their
&s;ituation, Prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to give them battle,
and made his di&s;po&s;itions accordingly. About ten in the
morning the grenadiers of the advanced guard began the
attack on the village of Bergen with great vivacity, and
&s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t terrible fire from eight German batta|lions,
&s;upported by &s;everal brigades of French infantry.
The grenadiers of the allied army, though re-enforced by
&s;everal battalions under the command of the Prince of
Y&s;embourg, far from di&s;todging the enemy from the vil|lage,
were, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, obliged to retreat
in &s;ome di&s;order, but rallied again behind a body of He&s;|&s;ian
cavalry. The allies being repul&s;ed in three different
attacks, their general made a new di&s;po&s;ition, and brought
up his artillery, with which the village and different parts
of the French line were &s;everally cannonaded. They were
not &s;low in retorting an equal fire, which continued till
night, when the allies retreated to Windeken, with the
lo&s;s of five pieces of cannon, and about two thou&s;and men,
including the Prince of Y&s;embourg, who fell in the action.
The French, by the nature of their &s;ituation, could not
&s;uffer much, but they were &s;o effectually amu&s;ed by the
artful di&s;po&s;ition of Prince Ferdinand, that, in&s;tead of
taking mea&s;ures to harra&s;s him in his retreat, they care|fully
maintained their &s;ituation, apprehen&s;ive of another
general attack. Indeed, they had great rea&s;on to be
&s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of this battle, without ri&s;king, in
any mea&s;ure, the advantage which they had gained. It
was their bu&s;ine&s;s to remain quiet, until their re-enforce|ments
&s;hould arrive, and this plan they in variably pur&s;ued.
On the other hand, the allies, in con&s;equence of their mi&s;|carriage,
were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of acting upon the
defen&s;ive, and encountering a great number of difficulties
and inconveniencies, during great part of the campaign,
until the mi&s;conduct of the enemy turned the &s;cale in their
favour. In the mean time, the Prince thought proper to begin
<PB N="83" REF="86">
his retreat in the night towards Fulda, in which his rear
&s;uffered con&s;iderably from a body of the enemy's light
troops, under the command of M. de Blai&s;el, who &s;ur|pri&s;ed
two &s;quadrons of dragoons, and a battalion of gre|nadiers.
The fir&s;t were taken or di&s;per&s;ed; the la&s;t e&s;ca|ped
with the lo&s;s of their baggage. The allied army re|turned
to their cantonments about Mun&s;ter, and the
Prince began to make preparations for taking the field in
earne&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. While the French enjoyed plenty in the neigh|bourhood
of Du&s;&s;eldorp and Crevelt, by means of the
Rhine, the allies laboured under a dearth and &s;carcity of
every &s;pecies of provi&s;ion, becau&s;e the country which they
occupied was already exhau&s;ted, and all the &s;upplies were
brought from an immen&s;e di&s;tance. The &s;ingle article
of forage occa&s;ioned &s;uch enormous expen&s;e, as alarmed
the admini&s;tration of Great Britain, who, in order to pre|vent
mi&s;management and fraud for the future, nominated
a member of parliament in&s;pector-general of the forage,
and &s;ent him over to Germany in the beginning of the
year, with the rank and appointments of a general officer,
that the importance of his character, and the nature of his
office, might be a check upon tho&s;e who were &s;u&s;pected
of iniquitous appropriations. This gentleman is &s;aid to
have met with &s;uch a cold reception, and &s;o many morti|fications
in the execution of his office, that he was in a
very little time &s;ick of his employment. An enquiry into
the cau&s;es of his reception, and of the practices which
rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to appoint &s;uch a &s;uperintendant,
may be the province of &s;ome future hi&s;torian, when truth
may be inve&s;tigated freely, without any apprehen&s;ion of
pains and penalties.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. While great part of the allied army remained
in cantonments about Mun&s;ter, the French armies on the
Upper and Lower Rhine, being put in motion, joined on
the third day of June near Marpurg, under the command
of the Mare&s;chal de Contades, who advanced to the north|ward,
and fixed his head quarters at Corbach; from
whence he detached a body of light troops to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="84" REF="87">
of Ca&s;&s;el, which at his approach was abandoned by
General Imhoff. The French army being encamped at
Stadtberg, the Duke de Broglio, who commanded the right
wing, advanced from Ca&s;&s;el into the territories of Hano|ver,
where he occupied Gottingen without oppo&s;ition;
while the allied army a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood
of Lip&s;tadt, and encamped about Soe&s;t and Werle,
Prince Ferdinand, finding him&s;elf inferior to the united
forces of the enemy, was obliged to retire as they ad|vanced,
after having left &s;trong garri&s;ons in Lip&s;tadt,
Retberg, Mun&s;ter, and Minden. The&s;e precautions,
however, &s;eemed to produce little effect in his favour,
Retberg was &s;urpri&s;ed by the Duke de Broglio, who
likewi&s;e took Minden by a&s;&s;ault, and made Gen. Za&s;trow,
with his garri&s;on of fifteen hundred men, pri&s;oners of
war; a mi&s;fortune con&s;iderably aggravated by the lo&s;s of
an immen&s;e magazine of hay and corn, which fell into
the hands of the enemy. They likewi&s;e made them&s;elves
ma&s;ters of Mun&s;ter, inve&s;ted Lip&s;tadt, and all their ope|rations
were hitherto crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The regen|cy
of Hanover, alarmed at their progre&s;s, re&s;olved to pro|vide
for the wor&s;t, by &s;ending their chancery and mo&s;t
valuable effects to Stade, from whence, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;i|ty,
they might be conveyed by &s;ea to England. In the
mean time they exerted all their indu&s;try in pre&s;&s;ing men
for recruiting and re-enforcing the army under Prince
Ferdinand, who &s;till continued to retire; and on the
eleventh day of July removed his head-quarters from
O&s;nabruck to Bomte, near the We&s;er. Here having re|ceived
advice that Minden was taken by the French, he
&s;ent forwards a detachment to &s;ecure the po&s;t of Saltznau
on that river, where on the fifteenth he encamped.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The general of the allied army had for &s;ome
time exhibited marks of animo&s;ity towards Lord George
Sackville, the &s;econd in command, who&s;e exten&s;ive under|&s;tanding,
penetrating eye, and inqui&s;itive &s;pirit, could
neither be deceived, dazzled, nor &s;oothed into tame acqui|e&s;cence.
He had oppo&s;ed, with all his influence, a de&s;ign
<PB N="85" REF="88">
of retiring towards the frontiers of Brun&s;wick, in order to
cover that country. He &s;uppo&s;ted his oppo&s;ition, by al|ledging
that it was the enemy's favourite object to cut off
their communication with the We&s;er and the Elbe; in
which, &s;hould they &s;ucceed, it would be found impo&s;&s;ible to
tran&s;port the Briti&s;h troops to their own country, which
was at that time threatened with inva&s;ion. He, therefore,
in&s;i&s;ted upon the army's retreating, &s;o as to keep the com|munication
open with Stade, where, in ca&s;e of emergency,
the Engli&s;h troops might be embarked. By adhering
tenaciou&s;ly to this opinion, and exhibiting other in&s;tances
of a prying di&s;po&s;ition, he had rendered him&s;elf &s;o di&s;|agreeable
to the commander in chief, that, in all appear|ance,
nothing was &s;o eagerly de&s;ired as an opportunity of
removing him from the &s;tation he filled.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Mean while, the French general, advancing
to Minden, encamped in a &s;trong &s;ituation, having that
town on his right, a &s;teep hill on his left, a mora&s;s in front,
and a rivulet in rear. The Duke de Broglio commanded
a &s;eparate body between Han&s;bergen and Minden, on the
other &s;ide of the We&s;er; and a third, under the Duke de
Bri&s;&s;ac, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou&s;and men, occupied a
&s;trong po&s;t by the village of Coveldt, to facilitate the route
of the convoys from Paderborn. Prince Ferdinand having
moved his camp from Soltznau to Peter&s;hagen, detached
the Hereditary Prince on the twenty-eighth day of July to
Lubeke, from whence he drove the enemy; and proceed|ing
to Rim&s;el, was joined by Major-General Dreves, who
had retaken O&s;nabruck, and cleared all that neighbourhood
of the enemy's parties: then he advanced towards Her|vorden,
and fixed his quarters at Kirchlinneger, to ham|per
the enemy's convoys from Paderborn. During the&s;e
tran&s;actions, Prince Ferdinand marched with the allied
army in three columns from Peter&s;hagen to Hille, where
it encamped, having a mora&s;s on the right, the village of
Fredewalde on the left, and in front tho&s;e of Northemmern
and Holtzenhau&s;en. Fifteen battalions and nineteen &s;qua|drons,
with a brigade of heavy artillery, were left under
<PB N="86" REF="89">
the command of General Wangenheim on the left, be|hind
the village of Dodenhau&s;en, which was fortified with
&s;ome redoubts, defended by two battalions. Colonel
Luckner, with the Hanoverian hu&s;&s;ars, and a brigade of
hunters, &s;u&s;tained by two battalions of grenadiers, was
po&s;ted between Buckebourg and the We&s;er, to ob&s;erve
the body of troops commanded by the Duke de Broglio on
the other &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. On the la&s;t day of July, the Mare&s;chal de Con|tades
re&s;olving to attack the allied army, ordered the corps
of Brogllo to repa&s;s the river; and advancing in eight
columns, about midnight pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet of Barta, that
runs along the mora&s;s, and falls into the We&s;er at Min|den.
At day-break he formed his army in order of battle,
part of it fronting the corps of General Wangenheim at
Dodenhau&s;en, and part of it facing Hille; the two wings
con&s;i&s;ting of infantry, and the cavalry being &s;tationed in
the centre. At three in the morning the enemy began to
cannonade the Prince's quarters at Hille from a battery of
&s;ix cannon, which they had rai&s;ed in the preceding even|ing
on the dike of Eickhor&s;t. This was probably the fir&s;t
intimation he received of their intention. He forth with
cau&s;ed two pieces of artillery to be conveyed to Hille, and
ordered the officer of the piquet-guard po&s;ted there to
defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity: at the &s;ame time, he
&s;ent orders to General Gie&s;en, who occupied Lubeke, to
attack the enemy's po&s;t at Eickhor&s;t; and this &s;ervice was
&s;ucce&s;sfully performed. The Prince of Anhalt, lieutenant-general
for the day, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with the re&s;t of the
piquets of the village of Halen, where Prince Ferdinand
re&s;olved to &s;upport his right. It was already in the hands
of the enemy, but they &s;oon abandoned it with precipita|tion.
The allied army being put into motion, advanced in
eight columns, and occupied the ground between Halen
and Hammern, while General Wangenheim's corps filled up
the &s;pace between this la&s;t village and Dodenhau&s;en. The
enemy made their principal effort on the left, intending
to force the infantry of Wangenheim's corps, and penr|trate
<PB N="87" REF="90">
between it and the body of the allied army. For
this purpo&s;e, the Duke de Broglio attacked them with
great fury, but was &s;everely checked by a battery of thirty
cannon, prepared for his reception by the Count de
Buckebourg, grand ma&s;ter of the artillery, and &s;erved
with admirable effect, under his own eye and direction.
About five in the morning both armies cannonaded each
other; at &s;ix the fire of mu&s;quetry began with great viva|city,
and the action became very hot towards the right, where
&s;ix regiments of Engli&s;h infantry, and two battalions of
Hanoverian guards, not only bore the whole brunt of the
French carabineers and gendarmerie, but ab&s;olutely broke
every body of hor&s;e and foot that advanced to attack them
on the left and in the centre. The He&s;&s;ian cavalry, with
&s;ome regiments of Hol&s;tein, Pru&s;&s;ian, and Hanoverian
dragoons po&s;ted on the left, performed good &s;ervice. The
cavalry on the right had no opportunity of engaging.
They were de&s;tined to &s;upport the infantry of the third
line; they con&s;i&s;ted of the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian hor&s;e,
commanded by Lord George Sackville, who&s;e &s;econd was
the Marquis of Granby. They were po&s;ted at a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance from the fir&s;t line of infantry, and di|vided
from it by a &s;canty wood that bordered on a heath.
Orders were &s;ent, during the action, to bring them up,
but whether the&s;e orders were contradictory, unintelli|gible,
or imperfectly executed, they did not arrive in time
to have any &s;hare in the action<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That the general was not plea&s;ed with the behaviour of Lord George
Sackville may be gathered from the following compliment to the Marquis of
Granby, implying a &s;evere Reflexion upon his &s;uperior in command:

regiment of Hol&s;tein, the He&s;&s;ian cavalry, the Hanoverian regiment du Corps,

Serene Highne&s;s is extremely obliged to the Count de Buckebourg, for his ex|traordinary

brigades of artillery, viz. Colonel Browne, Lieutenant-Colonel Hutte, Ma|$or
Ha&s;&s;e, and the three Engli&s;h captains, Philips, Drummond, and Foy.
His Serene Highne&s;s thinks him&s;elf infinitely obliged to Major-Generals
Waldegrave and King&s;ley, for their great courage, and good order in which
they conducted their brigades. His Serene Highne&s;s further orders it to be
declared to Lieutenant-General the Marquis of Granby, that he is per&s;uaded,
that if he had the good fortune to have had him at the head of the ca|valry

up in time and condition to perform effectual &s;ervice, had
the orders been explicit and con&s;i&s;tent, and the com|mander
acted with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. Be that as it
will, the enemy were repul&s;ed in all their attacks with
con&s;iderable lo&s;s: at length they gave way in every part;
and about noon, abandoning the field of battle, were pur|&s;ued
to the ramparts of Minden. In this action they lo&s;t
a great number of men, with forty-three large cannon,
and many colours and &s;tandards; whereas the lo&s;s of the
allies was very incon&s;iderable, as it chiefly fell upon a few
regiments of Briti&s;h infantry, commanded by the Major-Generals
Waldegrave and King&s;ley. To the extraordi|nary
prowe&s;s of the&s;e gallant brigades, and the fire of
the Briti&s;h artillery, which was admirably &s;erved by the
Captains Philips, Macbean, Drummond, and Foy, the
<PB N="89" REF="92">
victory was in a great mea&s;ure a&s;cribed. The &s;ame night
the enemy pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and burned the bridges over
that river. Next day the garri&s;on of Minden &s;urrendered
at di&s;cretion, and here the victors found a great number
of French officers wounded.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. At fir&s;t the Mare&s;chal de Contades &s;eemed in|clined
to retreat through the defiles of Wittekend&s;tein,
to Paderborn; but he was fain to change his re&s;olution,
in con&s;equence of his having received advice, that on the
very day of his own defeat the Duke de Bri&s;&s;ac was van|gui&s;hed
by the Hereditary Prince in the neighbourhood
of Coveldt, &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age of the mountains was ren|dered
impracticable. The Duke de Bri&s;&s;ac had been ad|vantageou&s;ly
encamped with his left to the village of
of Coveldt, having the Werra in front, and his right ex|tending
to the &s;alt-pits. In this advantageous &s;ituation he
was attacked by the Hereditary Prince and General de
Kilman&s;eg with &s;uch vivacity and addre&s;s, that his troops
were totally routed, with the lo&s;s of &s;ix cannon, and a
con&s;iderable number of men killed, wounded, or taken
pri&s;oners. After the battle of Minden, Colonel Freytag,
at the head of the light troops, took, in the neighbour|hood
of Detmold, all the equipage of the Mare&s;chal de
Contades, the Prince of Conde, and the Duke de Bri&s;&s;ac,
with part of their military che&s;t and chancery, containing
papers of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following extracts of letters from the Duke de Bellei&s;te to the Mare&s;chal de Contades will convey &s;ome idea of the virtue, policy, and nece&s;|&s;ities of the French mini&s;try: &startq;I am &s;till afraid that Fi&s;her &s;ets out too late: it is, however, very important, and very e&s;&s;ential, that we &s;hould rai&s;e large contributions.

the We&s;er at Hamelen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> in order to pur&s;ue the enemy,
who retreated to Ca&s;&s;el, and from thence, by the way of
Marpurg, as far as Gie&s;&s;en. In a word, they were con|tinually
harra&s;&s;ed by that enterpri&s;ing prince, who &s;ei&s;ed
every opportunity of making an impre&s;&s;ion upon their
army; took the greate&s;t part of their baggage; and com|pelled
them to abandon every place they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in We&s;t|phalia&punc;
The number of his pri&s;oners amounted to fifteen
hundred men, be&s;ides the garri&s;on left at Ca&s;&s;el, which
&s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. He likewi&s;e &s;urpri&s;ed a whole
battalion, and defeated a con&s;iderable detachment under
the command of M. d'Armentieres. In the mean time,
the allied army advanced in regular marches; and Prince
Ferdinand, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ca&s;&s;el, detached
General Imhoff, with a body of troops, to reduce the
city of Mun&s;ter, which he accordingly began to bombard
and cannonade; but M. d'Armentieres, being joined by
a fre&s;h body of troops from the Lower Rhine, advanced
to its relief, and compelled Imho&s;t to rai&s;e the &s;iege. It
was not long, however, before this general was al&s;o re-en|forced;
then he mea&s;ured back his march to Mun&s;ter,
and the French commander withdrew in his turn. The
<PB N="92" REF="95">
place was immediately &s;hut up by a clo&s;e blockade $word$
which, however, did not prevent the introduction $word$
&s;upplies. The city of Mun&s;ter, being an object of im|portance,
was di&s;puted with great ob&s;tinacy. Arme$$
tieres received re-enforcements, and the body commande $word$
by Imhoff was occa&s;ionally augmented; but the &s;iege $word$ not formally undertaken till November, when &s;ome heav$$
artillery being brought from England, the place was regu|larly
inve&s;ted, and the operations carried on with &s;uc$
vigour, that in a few days the city &s;urrendered on capitu|lation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Prince Ferdinand having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf $word$
the town and ca&s;tle of Marpurg, proceeded with the arm$
to Neider-Weimar, and there encamped; while Contade
remained at Gie&s;&s;en, on the &s;outh &s;ide the river $word$
where he was joined by a colleague in the per&s;on of th$
Mare&s;chal d'E&s;trees. By this time he was become ver$
unpopular among the troops, on account of the defeat a
Minden, which he is &s;aid to have charged on the mi&s;con|duct
of Broglio, which recriminated on him in his turn,
and &s;eemed to gain credit at the court of Ver&s;aille$$
While the two armies lay encamped in the neighbourhood
of each other, nothing pa&s;&s;ed but &s;kirmi&s;hes among the
light troops, and little excur&s;ive expeditions. The French
army was employed in removing their magazines, and for|tifying
Gie&s;&s;en, as if their intention was to retreat to
Fanckfort on the Maine, after having con&s;umed all the
forage, and made a military de&s;ert between the Lahn and
that river. In the beginning of November, the Mare&s;|chal
Duke de Broglio returned from Paris, and a&s;&s;ume$
the command of the army, from whence Contades and
d'E&s;trees immediately retired, with &s;everal other gener$$
officers that were &s;enior to the new commander.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The Duke of Wirtemberg having take$
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fulda, the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick
re&s;olved to beat up his quarters. For this purpo&s;e he &s;e|lected
a body of troops, and began his march from Mar|purg
early in the morning on the twenty-eighth day of
<PB N="93" REF="96">
November. Next night they lay at Augerbach, where they
defeated the volunteers of Na&s;&s;au: and at one o'clock in
the morning of the thirtieth, they marched directly to
Fulda, where the Duke of Wirtemberg, far from ex|pecting
&s;uch a vi&s;it, had invited all the fa&s;hionable people
in Fulda to a &s;umptuous entertainment. The Hereditary
Prince, having reconnoitred the avenues in per&s;on, took
&s;uch mea&s;ures, that the troops of Wirtemberg, who were
&s;cattered in &s;mall bodies, would have been cut off, if they
had not ha&s;tily retired into the town, where, however,
they found no &s;helter. The Prince forced open the gates;
and they retreated to the other &s;ide of the town, where
four battalions of them were defeated and taken; while
the Duke him&s;elf, with the re&s;t of his forces, filed off on
the other &s;ide of the Fulda. Two pieces of cannon, two
pair of colours, and all their baggage, fell into the hands
of the victors; and the Hereditary Prince advanced as far
as Rupertenrade, a place &s;ituated on the right flank of the
French army. Perhaps this motion ha&s;tened the re&s;o|lution
of the Duke de Broglio to abandon Gie&s;&s;en, and
fall back to Friedberg, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters.
The allied army immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his camp at Kleinlinnes and Heuchelam, and &s;eemed
to make preparations for the &s;iege of Gie&s;&s;en.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. While both armies remained in this po&s;ition,
the Duke de Broglio received the &s;taff as mare&s;chal of
France, and made an attempt to beat up the quarters of
the allies. Having called in all his detachments, he
marched up to them on the 25th day of December; but
found them &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to give him a warm reception,
that he thought proper to lay a&s;ide his de&s;ign, and nothing
but a mutual cannonade en&s;ued; then he returned to his
former quarters. From Kleinlinnes the allied army re|moved
to Cor&s;dorff, where they were cantoned till the begin|ning
of January, when they fell back as far as Marpurg,
where Prince Ferdinand e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters.
The enemy had by this time retrieved their &s;uperiority,
in con&s;equence of the Hereditary Prince's being detached
<PB N="94" REF="97">
with fifteen thou&s;and men to join the King of Pru&s;&s;ia $word$
Freyberg, in Saxony. Thus, by the victory at Minden,
the dominions of Hanover and Brun&s;wick were pre&s;erved,
and the enemy obliged to evacuate great part of We&s;tpha|lia.
Perhaps they might have been driven to the other
&s;ide of the Rhine, had not the general of the allies been
obliged to weaken his army for the &s;upport of the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch, who had met with divers di&s;a&s;ters in the cour&s;e
of this campaign. It was not to any relaxation or aba$$|ment
of his u&s;ual vigilance and activity that this warli$$
prince owed the &s;everal checks he received. Even in the
middle of winter, his troops, under General Manteuffel,
acted with great &s;pirit again&s;t the Swedes in Pomerania.
They made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Damgarten, and &s;eve|ral
other places which the Swedes had garri&s;oned; and,
the fro&s;t &s;etting in, tho&s;e who were quartered in the i&s;le
of U&s;edom pa&s;&s;ed over the ice to Wolga&s;t, which they re|duced
without much difficulty. They undertook the
&s;ieges of Demmin and Anclam at the &s;ame time, and the
garri&s;ons of both &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war,
to the number of two thou&s;and &s;even hundred men, in|cluding
officers. In Demmin they found four-and-twenty
pieces of cannon, with a large quantity of ammunition.
In Anclam there was a con&s;iderable magazine, with &s;ix-and-thirty
cannon, mortars, and howitzers. A large de|tachment
under General Knobloch &s;urpri&s;ed Erfurth, and
rai&s;ed con&s;iderable contributions at Gotha, Ei&s;e$ach, and
Fulda; from whence al&s;o they conveyed all the forage
and provi&s;ions to Saxe-Naumberg. In the latter end of
February, the Pru&s;&s;ian Major-General Wober&s;now
marched with a &s;trong body of troops from Gloga$ in
Sile&s;ia to Poland; and, advancing by the way of Li&s;&s;a,
attacked the ca&s;tle of the Prince Sulkow&s;ki, a Poli&s;h
grandee, who had been very active again&s;t the intere&s;t of
the Pru&s;$ian monarch. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance he was obli|ged
to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, and was &s;ent pri&s;oner with
his whole garri&s;on to Sile&s;ia. From hence Wober&s;now
proceeded to Po&s;na, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a
<PB N="95" REF="98">
con&s;iderable magazine, guarded by two thou&s;and Co&s;&s;acks,
who retired at his approach; and, having de&s;troyed &s;eve|ral
others, returned to Sile&s;ia. In April, the fort of Pe|namunde,
in Pomerania, was &s;urrendered to Manteuffel;
and about the &s;ame time a detachment of Pru&s;&s;ian troops
bombarded Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg.
Mean while, re-enforcements were &s;ent to the Ru&s;&s;ian
army in Poland, which in April began to a&s;&s;emble upon
the Vi&s;tula. The court of Peter&s;burgh had likewi&s;e begun
to equip a large fleet, by means of which the army might
be &s;upplied with military &s;tores and provi&s;ions; but this
armament was retarded by an accidental fire at Revel,
which de&s;troyed all the magazines and materials for &s;hip-building
to an immen&s;e value.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. About the latter end of March the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia a&s;&s;embled his army at Rhon&s;tock, near Strigau;
and advancing to the neighbourhood of Land&s;hut, en|camped
at Bolchenhayn. On the other hand, the Au|&s;trian
army, under the command of Mare&s;chal Daun,
was a&s;&s;embled at Munchengratz, in Bohemia; and the
campaign was opened by an exploit of General Beck,
who &s;urpri&s;ed and made pri&s;oners a battalion of Pru&s;&s;ian
grenadiers, po&s;ted under Colonel Durin&s;heven, at Grie|fenberg,
on the frontiers of Sile&s;ia. This advantage,
however, was more than counterbalanced by the activity
and &s;ucce&s;s of Prince Henry, brother to the Pru&s;&s;ian
king, who commanded the army which wintered in
Saxony. About the middle of April he marched in two
columns towards Bohemia, forced the pa&s;s of Peter&s;walde,
de&s;troyed the Au&s;trian magazine at Au&s;&s;ig, burned their
boats upon the Elbe, &s;ei&s;ed the forage and provi&s;ion which
the enemy had left at Lowo&s;itz and Leutmeritz, and de|moli&s;hed
a new bridge which they had built for their
convenience. At the &s;ame time, General Hul&s;en attacked
the pa&s;s of Pa&s;sberg, guarded by General Renard, who
was taken, with two thou&s;and men, including fifty of|ficers:
then he advanced to Satz, in hopes of &s;ecuring
the Au&s;trian magazines; but the&s;e the enemy con&s;umed,
<PB N="96" REF="99">
that they might not fall into his hands, and retired to|wards
Prague with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Prince Henry, having happily atchieved the&s;e
adventures, and filled all Bohemia with alarm and con|&s;ternation,
returned to Saxony, and di&s;tributed his troops
in quarters of refre&s;hment in the neighbourhood of Dre&s;|den.
In a few days, however they were again put in
motion, and marched to Obelgeburgen; from whence he
continued his route through Voightland, in order to attack
the army of the empire in Franconia. He accordingly
entered this country by the way of Hoff, on the &s;eventh
of May, and next day &s;ent a detachment to attack General
Macguire, who commanded a body of Imperiali&s;ts at
A&s;ch, and &s;u&s;tained the charge with great gallantry; but
&s;inding him&s;elf in danger of being overpowered by num|bers,
he retired in the night towards Egra. The army
of the Empire, commanded by the Prince de Deux-Ponts,
being unable to cope with the Pru&s;&s;ian general in the field,
retired from Cullembach to Bamberg, and from thence
to Nuremberg, where, in all probability, they would
not have been &s;uffered to remain unmole&s;ted, had not
Prince Henry been recalled to Saxony. He had already
taken Cronach and the ca&s;tle of Rotenberg, and even ad|vanced
as far as Bamberg, when he received advice that a
body of Au&s;trians, under General Gemmingen, had pe|netrated
into Saxony. This diver&s;ion effectually &s;aved the
army of the empire, as Prince Henry immediately re|turned
to the electorate, after having laid the bi&s;hoprick of
Bamberg and the marqui&s;ate of Cullembach under contri|bution,
de&s;troyed all the magazines provided for the Im|perial
army, and &s;ent &s;ifteen hundred pri&s;oners to Leip&s;ick,
A party of Imperiali&s;ts, under Count Palfy, endeavoured
to harra&s;s him in his retreat; but they were defeated near
Hoff, with con&s;iderable &s;laughter: neverthele&s;s, the Im|perial
army, though now reduced to ten thou&s;and men,
returned to Bamberg; and as the Pru&s;&s;ians approached
the frontiers of Saxony, the Au&s;trian general, Gemmi$|gen,
retired into Bohemia. During all the&s;e tran&s;actions,
<PB N="97" REF="100">
the Mare&s;chal Count Daun remained with the grand Au|&s;trian
army at Schurtz, in the circle of Koning&s;gratz;
while the Pru&s;&s;ians, commanded by the King in per&s;on,
continued quietly encamped between Land&s;hut and
Schweidnitz. General Fouquet commanded a large body
of troops in the &s;outhern part of Sile&s;ia; but the&s;e being
mo&s;tly withdrawn, in order to oppo&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ians, the
Au&s;trian general, De Fille, who hovered on the frontiers
of Moravia, with a con&s;iderable detachment, took ad|vantage
of this circum&s;tance, and, advancing into Sile&s;ia,
encamped within &s;ight of Nei&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. As mutual calumny and recrimination of
all kinds were not &s;pared on either &s;ide, during the progre&s;s
of this war, the enemies of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch did not
fail to charge him with cruelties committed at Schwerin,
the capital of Mecklenburg, which his troops had bom|barded,
plundered of its archives, cannon, and all its youth
fit to carry arms, who were pre&s;&s;ed into his &s;ervice: he
be&s;ides taxed the duchy at &s;even thou&s;and men, and a
million of crowns, by way of contribution. He was
al&s;o accu&s;ed of barbarity, in i&s;&s;uing an order for removing
all the pri&s;oners from Berlin to Spandau; but this &s;tep he
ju&s;tified, in a letter to his mini&s;ters at foreign courts, de|claring,
that he had provided for all the officers that were
his pri&s;oners the be&s;t accommodation, and permitted them
to re&s;ide in his capital; that &s;ome of them had gro&s;&s;ly
abu&s;ed the liberty they enjoyed, by maintaining illicit
corre&s;pondence, and other practices equally offen&s;ive,
which had obliged him to remove them to the town of
Spandau: he de&s;ired, however, that the town might not
be confounded with the fortre&s;s of that name, from which
it was entirely &s;eparated, and in which they would enjoy
the &s;ame $a&s;e they had found at Berlin, though under
more vigilant in&s;pection. His conduct, on this occa&s;ion,
he &s;aid, was &s;ufficiently authori&s;ed, not only by the law
of nations, but al&s;o by the example of his enemies; ina&s;|much
as the Empre&s;s-Queen had never &s;uffered any of
his officers, who had fallen into her hands, to re&s;ide at
<PB N="98" REF="101">
Vienna; and the court of Ru&s;&s;ia had &s;ent &s;ome of them
as far as Ca&s;an. He concluded with &s;aying, that, a$
his enemies had let &s;lip no opportunity of blackening hi$
mo&s;t innocent proceedings, he had thought proper to ac|quaint
his mini&s;ters with his rea&s;ons for making this alter|ation
with regard to his pri&s;oners, whether French, Au|&s;trians,
or Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. In the beginning of June, the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, under&s;tanding that the Ru&s;&s;ian army had begun
their march from the Vi&s;tula, ordered the &s;everal bodies
of his troops, under Hul&s;en and Wober&s;now, re-en|forced
by detachments from his other armies, to join the
forces under Count Dohna, as general in chief, and
march into Poland. Accordingly, they advanced to Me|ritz,
where the Count having publi&s;hed a declaration
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The following declarations were publi&s;hed by Count Dohna, a Pru&s;&s;ian general&punc; on his entering Poland with a body of Pru&s;&s;ian troops. On the</HI> 15<HI>th of June.</HI>
HIS Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, finding him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity to cau&s;e part of his armies to enter the territories of the republick of Poland, in order to protect them again&s;t the threatened inva&s;ion of the enemy, declares that
It mu&s;t not be under&s;tood that his Maje&s;ty, by this &s;tep taken, intends to make any breach in the regard he has always had for the illu&s;trious republick of Poland, or to le&s;&s;en the good under&s;tanding which has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, but, on the contrary, to &s;trengthen the &s;ame, in expectation that the illu&s;trious republick will, on its part, act with the like neighbourly and friendly good will as is granted to the enemy, than which nothing more is de&s;ired.
The nobility, gentry, and magi&s;tracy, in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, between the frontiers of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;o far as beyond Po&s;en, are required to furni&s;h all kinds of provi&s;ions, corn, and &s;orage nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport an army of 40,000 men, with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, with an a&s;&s;urance of being paid ready money for the &s;ame. But if, contrary to expectation, any deficiency &s;hould happen in &s;upplying this demand, his Maje&s;ty's troops will be obliged to forage, and u&s;e the &s;ame means as tho&s;e taken by the enemy for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
In confidence thereof, that the &s;everal juri&s;dictions upon the Pru&s;&s;ian fron|tiers, within the territories of Poland, will exert them&s;elves to comply with this demand as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the royal army of Pru&s;&s;ia, they are a&s;&s;ured that thereby all di&s;orders will be prevented, and whatever to delivered will be paid for in ready money.
<HI>On the</HI> 17<HI>th of June.</HI>
IT was with the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment that the King, my mo&s;t gracious lord and ma&s;ter, heard that &s;everal of his own &s;ubjects had &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;educed from their allegiance &s;o far, as to enter into the &s;ervice of a potentate with whom he is at war; his Maje&s;ty, therefore, makes known by the&s;e pre&s;ents, that all of his &s;ubjects &s;erving in the enemy's armies, who &s;hall be taken with arms in their hands, &s;hall, agreeably to all laws, be &s;en|tenced to be hanged without mercy, as traitors to their king and country.

We invite and de&s;ire that the nobility, archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, abbeys, convents, &s;eigniories, magi&s;trates, and inhabitants of the republick of Po|land, on the road to Po&s;nania, and beyond it, would repair in per&s;on, or by deputies, in the cour&s;e of this week, or as &s;oon after as po&s;&s;ible, to the Pru&s;|&s;ian head-quarters, there to t$eat with the commander in chief, or the com|mi&s;&s;ary at war, for the delivery of &s;orage and provi&s;ions for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army, to be paid for with ready money.
We promi&s;e and a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that no per&s;on in Poland will attempt to &s;educe the Pru&s;&s;ian troops to de&s;ert; that no a&s;&s;i&s;tance will be given them in &s;uch perfidious practices; that they will neither be &s;heltered, concealed, or lodged; which would be followed by very di&s;agreeable con&s;equences; we expect, on the contrary, that per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions will &s;top any run-away or de&s;erter, and deliver him up to the fir&s;t advanced po&s;t, or at the head-quarters; and all expences attending the &s;ame &s;hall be paid, and a rea|&s;onable gratification &s;uper added.
If any one hath any inclination to enter into the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;ervice, with an intention to behave well and faithfully, he may apply to the head|quarters, and be a&s;&s;ured for a capitulation for three or four years.
If any prince or member of the republick of Poland be di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble a body of men, and to join in a troop, or in a company, the Pru&s;&s;ian army, to make a common cau&s;e with it, he may depend on a gracious reception, and that due regard will be &s;hewn to his merit, &amp;c.</NOTE>

he continued his march towards Po&s;na, where he found
the Ru&s;&s;ian army under Count Soltikoff &s;trongly encamp|ed,
having in their rear that city and the river Warta,
and in their front a formidable entrenchment, mounted
with a great number of cannon. Count Dohna judging
it impracticable to attack them in this &s;ituation with any
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, endeavoured to intercept their convoys
to the ea&s;tward; but, for want of provi&s;ion, was in a
little time obliged to return towards the Oder: then the
Ru&s;&s;ians advanced to Zullichaw, in Sile&s;ia. The King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, thinking Count Dohna had been rather too cau|tious,
<PB N="100" REF="103">
con&s;idering the emergency of affairs, gave him leave
to retire for the benefit of his health, and conferred his
command upon General Wedel, who re&s;olved to give the
Ru&s;&s;ians battle without delay. Thus determined, he
marched again&s;t them in two columns; and, on the
twenty-third day of July, attacked them at Kay, near
Zullichaw, where, after a very ob&s;tinate engagement, he was
repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, Wober&s;now being killed, and Man|teu&s;&s;el
wounded in the action; and in a few days the Ru&s;|&s;ians
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Franckfort upon the Oder.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. By this time, the armies of Count Daun and
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had made &s;everal motions. The Au|&s;trians
having quitted their camp at Schurtz, advanced
towards Zittau in Lu&s;atia, where having halted a few
days, they re&s;umed their march, and encamped at Gorlit|hayn,
between Sudenberg and Mark-Li&s;&s;au. His Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty, in order to ob&s;erve their motions, marched by
the way of Herchberg to Lahn; and his vanguard &s;kir|mi&s;hed
with that of the Au&s;trians commanded by Lau|dohn,
who entered Sile&s;ia by the way of Grieffenberg.
The Au&s;trian general was obliged to retreat with lo&s;s;
while the King penetrated into Sile&s;ia, that he might be
at hand to act again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, who&s;e progre&s;s was
now become the chief object of his apprehen&s;ion. He no
&s;ooner received intimation that Wedel had been wor&s;ted,
than he marched with a &s;elect body of ten thou&s;and men
from his camp in Sile&s;ia, in order to take upon him the com|mand
of Wedel's army, leaving the re&s;t of his forces &s;trong|ly
encamped, under the direction of his brother Prince
Henry, who had joined him before this event. Count Daun
being appri&s;ed of the King's intention, and knowing the Ru&s;|&s;ians
were very defective in cavalry, immediately detached a
body of twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e, to join them, under the
command of Laudohn; and the&s;e, penetrating in two
columns through Sile&s;ia and Lu&s;atia, with &s;ome lo&s;s, ar|rived
in the Ru&s;&s;ian camp at a very critical juncture.
Mean while the King of Pru&s;&s;ia joined General Wedel on
the fourth day of Augu&s;t at Muhlro&s;e, where he a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="101" REF="104">
the command of the army: but finding it greatly inferior
to the enemy, he recalled General Finck, whom he had
detached &s;ome time before, with a body of nine thou&s;and
men, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the Imperiali&s;ts in Saxony:
for when Prince Henry joined his brother in Sile&s;ia the
army of the Empire had entered that electorate. Thus
re-enforced, the number of the King's army at Muhlro&s;e
did not exceed fifty thou&s;and, whereas the Ru&s;&s;ians were
more numerous by thirty thou&s;and. They had cho&s;en a
&s;trong camp at the village of Cuner&s;dorf, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite
to Franckfort upon the Oder, and encrea&s;ed the natural
&s;trength of their &s;ituation by entrenchments mounted with
a numerous artillery. In other circum&s;tances it might
have been deemed a ra&s;h and ridiculous enterpri&s;e to attack
&s;uch an army under &s;uch complicated di&s;advantages; but
here was no room for he&s;itation. The King's affairs
&s;eemed to require a de&s;perate effort; and perhaps he was
partly impelled by &s;elf-confidence and animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Having determined to hazard an attack, he
made his di&s;po&s;ition, and on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t,
at two in the morning, his troops were in motion. The
army being formed in a wood, advanced towards the ene|my;
and about eleven the action was begun with a &s;evere
cannonade. This having produced the de&s;ired effect, he
charged the left wing of the Ru&s;&s;ian army with his be&s;t
troops formed in columns. After a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute
the enemy's entrenchments were forced with great
&s;laughter, and &s;eventy pieces of cannon fell into the hands
of the Pru&s;&s;ians. A narrow de&s;ile was afterwards pa&s;&s;ed,
and &s;everal redoubts that covered the village of Cuner&s;|dorf
were taken by a&s;&s;ault, one after another: one half of
the ta&s;k was not yet performed: the Ru&s;&s;ians made a
firm &s;tand at the village; but they were overborne by the
impetuo&s;ity of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who drove them from po&s;t
to po&s;t up to the la&s;t redoubts they had to defend. As the
Ru&s;&s;ians kept their ground until they were hewn down in
their ranks, this &s;ucce&s;s was not acquired without infinite
labour, and a con&s;iderable expen&s;e of blood. After a fu|rious
<PB N="102" REF="105">
conte&s;t of &s;ix hours, fortune &s;eemed to declare &s;o
much in favour of the Pru&s;&s;ians, that the King di&s;patched
the following billet to the Queen at Berlin: &startq;Madam,
we have driven the Ru&s;&s;ians from their entrenchments.
In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.&endq; This
intimation was premature, and &s;ubjected the writer to
the ridicule of his enemies. The Ru&s;&s;ians were &s;tagger|ed,
not routed. General Soltikoff rallied his troops, and
re-enforced his left wing under cover of a redoubt, which
was erected on an eminence called the Jews Burying-ground,
and here they &s;tood in order of battle, with the
mo&s;t re&s;olute countenance; favoured by the &s;ituation,
which was naturally difficult of acce&s;s, and now rendered
almo&s;t impregnable by the fortification, and a numerous
artillery, &s;till greatly &s;uperior to that of the Pru&s;&s;ians.
Had the King contented him&s;elf with the advantage al|ready
gained, all the world would have acknowledged he
had fought again&s;t terrible odds with a&s;toni&s;hing prowe&s;s;
and that he judiciou&s;ly de&s;i&s;ted, when he could no longer
per&s;evere without incurring the imputation of being ac|tuated
by frenzy or de&s;pair. His troops had not only &s;uf|fered
&s;everely from the enemy's fire, which was clo&s;e,
deliberate, and well directed, but they were fatigued by the
hard &s;ervice, and fainting with the heat of the day, which
was exce&s;&s;ive. His general officers are &s;aid to have remind|ed
him of all the&s;e circum&s;tances; and to have di&s;&s;uaded
him from hazarding an attempt attended with &s;uch dan|ger
and difficulty, as even an army of fre&s;h troops could
hardly hope to &s;urmount. He rejected this &s;alutary ad|vice,
and ordered his infantry to begin a new attack,
which beingan enterpri&s;e beyond their &s;trength, they were
repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. Being afterwards rallied,
they returned to the charge: they mi&s;carried again, and
their lo&s;s was redoubled. Being thus rendered un&s;it for
further &s;ervice, the cavalry &s;ucceeded to the attack, and
repeated their un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts until they were almo&s;t
broke, and entirely exhau&s;ted. At this critical juncture,
the whole body of the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian cavalry, which
<PB N="103" REF="106">
had hitherto remained inactive, and were therefore fre&s;h,
and in &s;pirits, fell in among the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e with great
fury, broke their line at the fir&s;t charge, and forcing them
back upon the infantry, threw them into &s;uch di&s;order as
could not be repaired. The Pru&s;&s;ian army being thus in|volved
in confu&s;ion, was &s;eized with a panick, and in a
few minutes totally defeated and di&s;per&s;ed, notwith&s;tand|ing
the per&s;onal efforts of the King, who hazarded his
life in the hotte&s;t parts of the battle, led on his troops three
times to the charge, had two hor&s;es killed under him, and
his clothes in &s;everal parts penetrated with mu&s;quet-balls.
His army being routed, and the greater part of his generals
either killed or di&s;abled by wounds, nothing but the ap|proach
of night could have &s;aved him from total ruin.
When he abandoned the field of battle, he di&s;patched ano|ther
billet to the Queen, couched in the&s;e terms: &startq;Re|move
from Berlin with the royal family. Let the
archives be carried to Pot&s;dam. The town may make
conditions with the enemy.&endq; The horror and confu|&s;ion
which this intimation produced at Berlin may be
ea&s;ily conceived: horror the more aggravated, as it &s;ei&s;ed
them in the mid&s;t of their rejoicing occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t
di&s;patch; and this was &s;till more dreadfully augmented,
by a &s;ub&s;equent indi&s;tinct relation, importing that the
army was totally routed, the King mi&s;&s;ing, and the enemy
in full march to Berlin. The battle of Cuner&s;dorf was
by far the mo&s;t bloody action that had happened &s;ince the
commencement of ho&s;tilities. The carnage was truely
horrible: above twenty thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians lay dead on
the $ield, and among the&s;e General Putkammer. The
Generals Seidlitz, Itzenplitz, Hul&s;en, Finck, and Wedel,
the Prince of Wirtemberg, and $ive major-generals were
wounded. The lo&s;s of the enemy amounted to ten thou|&s;and.
It mu&s;t be owned, that if the King was prodigal of
his own per&s;on, he was likewi&s;e very free with the lives of
his &s;ubjects. At no time, &s;ince the days of ignorance and
barbarity, were the lives of men &s;quandered away with
&s;uch profu&s;ion as in the cour&s;e of this German war.
<PB N="104" REF="107">
They were not only unnece&s;&s;arily &s;acrificed in various
exploits of no con&s;equence, but lavi&s;hly expo&s;ed to all
the rigour and di&s;temper of winter-campaigns, which
were introduced on the continent, in de&s;pite of nature,
and in contempt of humanity. Such are the improve|ments
of warriors without feeling! &s;uch the refinements
of German di&s;cipline! On the day that &s;ucceeded the de|feat
at Cuner&s;dorf, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, having lo&s;t the
be&s;t part of his army, together with his whole train of ar|tillery,
repa&s;&s;ed the Oder, and encamped at Retwin; from
whence he advanced to Fu&s;tenwalde, and &s;aw with a&s;to|ni&s;hment
the forbearance of the enemy. In&s;tead of tak|ing
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berlin, and overwhelming the wreck of
the King's troops, de&s;titute of cannon, and cut off from
all communication with Prince Henry, they took no &s;tep
to improve the victory they had gained. Laudohn retired
with his hor&s;e immediately after the battle, and Count Sol|tikoff
marched with part of the Ru&s;&s;ians into Lu&s;atia,
where he joined Daun, and held con&s;ultations with that
general. Perhaps the &s;afety of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch was
owing to the jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among his enemies. In
all probability, the court of Vienna would have been cha|grined
to &s;ee the Ru&s;&s;ians in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brandenburg,
and therefore thwarted their de&s;igns upon that electorate.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had now rea&s;on to be convinced that
his &s;ituation could not ju&s;tify &s;uch a de&s;perate attack as
that in which he had mi&s;carried at Cuner&s;dorf; for if the
Ru&s;&s;ians did not attempt the reduction of this capital,
now that he was totally defeated, and the flower of his
army cut off, they certainly would not have a&s;pired at that
conque&s;t while he lay encamped in the neighbourhood
with fifty thou&s;and veterans, inured to war, accu&s;tomed
to conquer, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and well &s;upplied with
provi&s;ion, ammunition, and artillery. As the victors al|lowed
him time to breathe, he improved this interval
with equal &s;pirit and &s;agacity. He re-a&s;&s;embled and re|fre&s;hed
his broken troops; he furni&s;hed his camp with
cannon from the ar&s;enal at Berlin, which likewi&s;e &s;up|plied
<PB N="105" REF="108">
him with a con&s;iderable number of recruits: he re|called
General Klei&s;t, with five thou&s;and men, from Po|merania;
and in a little time retrieved his former im|portance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The army of the Empire having entered
Saxony, where it reduced Leip&s;ick, Torgau, and even
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dre&s;den it&s;elf, the King detached &s;ix
thou&s;and men under General Wunch, to check the pro|gre&s;s
of the Imperiali&s;ts in that electorate; and perceiving
the Ru&s;&s;ians intended to be&s;iege Great Glogau, he, with
the re&s;t of his army, took po&s;t between them and that
city, &s;o as to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign. While the four great
armies, commanded by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, General Sol|tikoff,
Prince Henry, and Count Daun, lay encamped in
Lu&s;atia, and on the borders of Sile&s;ia, watching the mo|tions
of each other, the war was carried on by detach|ments
with great vivacity. General Wunch having reta|ken
Leip&s;ick, and joined Finck at Eulinbourg, the united
body began their march towards Dre&s;den; and a detach|ment
from the army of the Empire, which had encamped
near Dobelin, retired at their approach. As they advanced
to Noffin, General Haddick abandoned the advantage|ous
po&s;t he occupied near Roth-Scemberg, and, being
joined by the whole army of the Empire, re&s;olved to
attack the Pru&s;&s;ian generals, who now encamped at Cor|bitz
near Mei&s;&s;en; accordingly, on the twenty-fir&s;t day
of September, he advanced again&s;t them, and endeavour|ed
to di&s;lodged them by a furious cannonade, which was
mutually maintained from morning to night, when he
&s;ound him&s;elf obliged to retire with con&s;iderable lo&s;s&punc;
leaving the field of battle, with about five hundred pri&s;o|ners,
in the hands of the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. This advantage was &s;ucceeded by another
exploit of Prince Henry, who, on the twenty-third day
of the month, quitted his camp at Horn&s;dorf, near Corlitz,
and, after an incredible march of eleven German miles,
by the way of Rothenberg, arrived, about five in the af|ternoon,
at Hoyer&s;werda, where he &s;urpri&s;ed a body of
<PB N="106" REF="109">
four thou&s;and men, commanded by General Vehla, killed
&s;ix hundred, and made twice that number pri&s;oners; in|cluding
the commander him&s;elf. After this atchievement
he joined the corps of Finck and Wunch; while Mare&s;|chal
Daun likewi&s;e abandoned his camp in Lu&s;atia, and
made a forced march to Dre&s;den, in order to fru&s;trate the
Prince's &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ign on that capital. The Ru&s;&s;ians,
di&s;appointed in their &s;cheme upon Glogau, had repa&s;&s;ed
the Oder at Neu&s;alze, and were encamped at Frau&s;tadt;
General Laudohn, with a body of Au&s;trians, lay at
Sclichting&s;keim; and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia at Koben; all
three on or near the banks of that river. Prince Henry
perceiving his army almo&s;t &s;urrounded by Au&s;trian de|tachments,
ordered General Finck to drive them from
Vogel&s;ang, which they abandoned accordingly; and &s;ent
Wunch, with &s;ix battalions and &s;ome cavalry, acro&s;s the
Elbe, to join the corps of General Rebenti&s;h at Witten|berg,
whither he retired from Duben at the approach of
the Au&s;trians. On the twenty-ninth day of October the
Duke d'Aremberg, with &s;ixteen thou&s;and Au&s;trians, de|camped
from Dammitch, in order to occupy the heights
near Pret&s;ch, and was encountered by General Wunch,
who, being po&s;ted on two ri&s;ing grounds, cannonaded the
Au&s;trians in their march with con&s;iderable effect, and the
Prince took twelve hundred pri&s;oners, including Lieute|nant-General
Gemmingen, and twenty inferior officers,
with &s;ome cannon, great part of their tents, and a large
quantity of baggage. The Duke was obliged to change
his route, while Wunch marched from Duben to Eulen|burg;
and General Wa&s;&s;er&s;&s;eben occupied Strehla, where
next day the whole army encamped. In this &s;ituation the
Prince remained till the &s;ixteenth day of November,
when, being in danger of having his communication with
Torgau cut off by the enemy, he removed to a &s;trong
camp, where his left flank was covered by that city and
the river Elbe: his right being &s;ecured by a wood, and
great part of his front by an impa&s;&s;able mora&s;s. Here he was
re-enforced with about twenty thou&s;and men from Sile&s;ia,
<PB N="107" REF="110">
and joined by the King him&s;elf, who forthwith detached
General Finck, with nineteen battalions and thirty-five
&s;quadrons, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the defiles of Maxen and
Ottendorf, with a view to hinder the retreat of the Au&s;|trians
to Bohemia. This motion obliged Daun to retire
to Plauen; and the King advanced to Wil&s;durf, imagin|ing
that he had effectually &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign. Let|ters
were &s;ent to Berlin and Magdebourg, importing,
that Count Daun would be forced to hazard a battle, as
he had now no re&s;ource but in victory. Finck had no &s;oon|er
taken po&s;t on the hill near the village of Maxen, than
the Au&s;trian general &s;ent officers to reconnoitre his &s;itu|ation,
and immediately re&s;olved to attack him with the
corps de re&s;erve under the Baron de Sincere, which was
encamped in the neighbourhood of Dippodefwalda. It
was forthwith divided into four columns, which filed off
through the neighbouring woods; and the Pru&s;&s;ians ne|ver
dreamed of their approach until they &s;aw them&s;elves
entirely &s;urrounded. In this emergency they defended
them&s;elves with their cannon and mu&s;quetry until they
were overpowered by numbers, and their battery was ta|ken:
then they retired to another ri&s;ing ground, where
they rallied, but were driven from eminence to eminence,
until, by favour of the night, they made their la&s;t retreat
to Falkenhayn. In the mean time, Count Daun had
made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, that at day-break General Finck
found him&s;elf entirely enclo&s;ed, without the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of e&s;caping, and &s;ent a trumpet to Count Daun, to
demand a capitulation. This was granted in one &s;ingle
article, importing, That he and eight other Pru&s;&s;ian ge|nerals,
with the whole body of troops they commanded,
&s;hould be received as pri&s;oners of war. He was obliged
to &s;ubmit, and his whole corps, amounting to nineteen
battalions and thirty-five &s;quadrons, with &s;ixty-four pie|ces
of cannon, fifty pair of colours, and twenty-five &s;tand|ards,
fell into the hands of the Au&s;trian general. This
mi&s;fortune was the more mortifying to the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, as it implied a cen&s;ure on his conduct, for having
<PB N="108" REF="111">
detached &s;uch a numerous body of troops to a &s;ituation
where they could not be &s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t of the army
On the other hand, the court of Vienna exulted in th$$
victory, as an infallible proof of Daun's &s;uperior talents
and, in point of glory and advantage, much more than at
equivalent for the lo&s;s of the Saxon army, which, though
le&s;s numerous, capitulated in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and fifty-&s;ix, after having held out &s;ix weeks
again&s;t the whole power of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. Ge|neral
Hul&s;en had been detached, with about nine batta|lions
and thirty &s;quadrons, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Finck; but
he arrived at Klingenberg too late to be of any &s;ervice;
and, being recalled, was next day &s;ent to occupy the im|portant
po&s;t of Freyberg.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The defeat of General Finck was not the
only di&s;a&s;ter which befel the Pru&s;&s;ians at the clo&s;e of this
campaign. General Diercke, who was po&s;ted with &s;even
battalions of infantry, and a thou&s;and hor&s;e, on the right
bank of the Elbe, oppo&s;ite to Mei&s;&s;en, finding it imprac|ticable
to lay a bridge of pontoons acro&s;s the river, on
account of the floating ice, was obliged to tran&s;port his
troops in boats; and when all were pa&s;&s;ed, except him|&s;elf,
with the rear-guard, con&s;i&s;ting of three battalions, he
was, on the third day of December, in the morning, at|tacked
by a &s;trong body of Au&s;trians, and taken, with all
his men, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
weakened by the&s;e two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive defeats, that happened
in the rear of an unfortunate campaign, would hardly have
been able to maintain his ground at Freyberg, had not he
been at this juncture re-enforced by the body of troops
under the command of the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;|wick.
As for Daun, the advantages he had gained did
not elevate his mind above the u&s;ual maxims of his cautious
di&s;cretion. In&s;tead of attacking the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, re|&s;pectable
and formidable even in adver&s;ity, he quietly
occupied the &s;trong camp at Pirna, where he might be
at hand to &s;uccour Dre&s;den, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be attacked,
and maintain his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112">
&sect; XXXIV. By this time the Ru&s;&s;ians had retired to
winter-quarters in Poland; and the Swedes, after a fruit|le&s;s
excur&s;ion in the ab&s;ence of Manteuffel, retreated to
Stral&s;und and the i&s;le of Rugen. This campaign, there|fore,
did not prove more deci&s;ive than the la&s;t. Abun|dance
of lives were lo&s;t, and great part of Germany
was expo&s;ed to rapine, murther, famine, de&s;olation,
and every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery that war could engender. In
vain the confederating powers of Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, and
Sweden united their efforts to cru&s;h the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch.
Though his army had been defeated, and he him&s;elf totally
overthrown, with great &s;laughter, in the heart of his own
dominions, though he appeared in a de&s;perate &s;ituation,
environed by ho&s;tile armies, and two con&s;iderable detached
bodies of his troops were taken or de&s;troyed; yet he kept
all his adver&s;aries at bay till the approach of winter, which
proved his be&s;t auxiliary; and even maintained his foot|ing
in the electorate of Saxony, which &s;eemed to be the
prize conte&s;ted between him and the Au&s;trian general.
Yet, long before the approach of winter one would ima|gine
he mu&s;t have been cru&s;hed between the &s;hock of &s;o
many adver&s;e ho&s;ts, had they been intent upon clo&s;ing
him in, and heartily concurred for his de&s;truction: but,
in&s;tead of urging the war with accumulated force, they
acted in &s;eperate bodies, and with jealous eye &s;eemed to
regard the progre&s;s of each other. It was not, therefore,
to any compunction, or kind forbearance, in the court of
Vienna, that the inactivity of Daun was owing. The
re&s;entment of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;eemed, on the con|trary,
to glow with redoubled indignation, and the ma|jority
of the Germanick body &s;eemed to enter with
warmth into her quarrel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The ob&s;tinacy of the powers in oppo&s;ition to Great-Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia appeared &s;till more remarkable in their &s;lighting the following declaration, which Duke Louis of Brun&s;wick delivered to their mini&s;ters at the Hague, in the month of December, after Quebeck was reduced, and the fleet of France totally defeated.
&startq; Their Britannick and Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ties, moved with compa&s;&s;ion at the mi&s;chiefs which the war that has been kindled for &s;ome years has already occa&s;ioned, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce, would think them&s;elves wanting to the duties of humanity, and particularly to their tender concern for the pre&s;ervation and well-being of their re&s;pective kingdoms and &s;ubjects, if they neglected the proper means to put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of &s;o &s;evere a ca|lamity, and to contribute to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of publick tranquillity. In this view, and in order to manife&s;t the purity of their intention in this re&s;pect, their &s;aid Maje&s;ties have determined to make the following decla|ration, viz.&endq;

&sect; XXXV. When the prote&s;tant &s;tates in arms again&s;t
the court of Vienna were put under the ban of the Em|pire,
the Evangelical body, though without the concur|rence
of the Swedi&s;h and Dani&s;h mini&s;ters, i&s;&s;ued an arret
at Rati&s;bon, in the month of November of the la&s;t year,
and to this annexed the twentieth article of the capitu|lation
&s;igned by the Emperor at his election, in order to
demon&s;trate that the prote&s;tant &s;tates claimed nothing
but what was agreeable to the con&s;titution. They de|clared
that their a&s;&s;ociation was no more than a mutual
engagement, by which they obliged them&s;elves to adhere
to the laws, without &s;uffering, under any pretext, that the
power of putting under the ban of the Empire &s;hould re|&s;ide
wholly in the Emperor. They affirmed that this
power was renounced, in expre&s;s terms, by the capitula|tion:
they, therefore, refu&s;ed to admit, as legal, any &s;en|tence
of the ban deficient in the requi&s;ite conditions;
and inferred, that, according to law, neither the Elector
of Brandenburg, nor the Elector of Hanover, nor the Duke
of Wolfenbuttel, nor the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, nor the
Count of Lippe-Buckebourg, ought to be pre&s;cribed. The
Imperial prote&s;tant cities having acceded to this arret or
declaration, the Emperor, in a re&s;cript, required them
to retract their acce&s;&s;ion to the re&s;olution of the Evan|gelick
body; which, it mu&s;t be owned, was altogether
incon&s;i&s;tent with their former acce&s;&s;ion to the re&s;olutions
of the diet again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. This re&s;cript
<PB N="111" REF="114">
having produced no effect, the arret was an&s;wered in Feb|ruary
by an Imperial decree of commi&s;&s;ion carried to the
dictature, importing, that the Imperial court could not
longer he&s;itate about the execution of the ban, without
infringing that very article of the capitulation which they
had &s;pecified: that the invalidity of the arret was mani|fe&s;t,
ina&s;much as the Electors of Brandenburg and Brun&s;|wick,
the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha and Brun&s;wick-Wolfen|buttel,
and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, were the
very per&s;ons who di&s;turbed the Empire; this, therefore,
being an affair in which they them&s;elves were parties,
they could not po&s;&s;ibly be qualified to concur in a re&s;o|lution
of this nature: be&s;ides, the number of the other
&s;tates which had acceded was very incon&s;iderable: for
the&s;e rea&s;ons, the Emperor could not but con&s;ider the
re&s;olution in que&s;tion as an act whereby the general peace
of the Empire was di&s;turbed, both by the parties that had
incurred the ban, and by the &s;tates which had joined them,
in order to &s;upport and favour their frivolous preten&s;ions.
His Imperial Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed his hope and confidence,
that the other electors, princes, and &s;tates of the Empire
would vote the &s;aid re&s;olution to be null, and of no force;
and never &s;uffer &s;o &s;mall a number of &s;tates, who were
adherents of and abettors to the di&s;turbers of the Empire,
to prejudice the rights and prerogatives of the whole Ger|manick
body; to abu&s;e the name of the a&s;&s;ociated e&s;tates
of the Aug&s;bourg confe&s;&s;ion, in order forcibly to impo&s;e a
<HI>factum,</HI> entirely repugnant to the con&s;titution of the Em|pire;
to deprive their co-e&s;tates of the right of voting
freely, and thereby endeavouring totally to &s;ubvert the
&s;y&s;tem of the Germanick body. The&s;e remarks will
&s;peak for them&s;elves to the reflexion of the unprejudiced
reader.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The implacability of the court of Vienna
was equalled by nothing but the per&s;everance of the French
mini&s;try. Though their numerous army had not gained
one inch of ground in We&s;tphalia, the campaign on that
&s;ide having ended exactly where it had begun: though the
<PB N="112" REF="115">
chief &s;ource of their commerce in the We&s;t-Indies had
fallen into the hands of Great-Britain, and they had al|ready
laid their account with the lo&s;s of Quebeck: though
their coffers rung with emptine&s;s, and their confederates
were clamorous for &s;ub&s;idies, they &s;till re&s;olved to maintain
the war in Germany; this was doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t politick
re&s;olution to which they could adhere, becau&s;e their ene|mies,
in&s;tead of exerting all their efforts where there was
almo&s;t a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, kindly conde&s;cended to &s;eek
them where alone their whole &s;trength could be advan|tageou&s;ly
employed, without any great augmentation of
their ordinary expen&s;e. Some of the &s;prings of their na|tional
wealth were indeed exhau&s;ted, or diverted into
other channels: but the &s;ubjects declared for a con|tinuation
of the war, and the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate were
&s;upplied by the loyalty and attachment of the people.
They not only acquie&s;ced in the bankruptey of publick
credit, when the court &s;topped payment of the intere&s;t
on twelve different branches of the national debt, but
they likewi&s;e &s;ent in large quantities of plate to be melted
down, and coined into &s;pecie, for the maintenance of the
war. All the bills drawn on the government by the co|lonies
were prote&s;ted, to an immen&s;e amount, and a &s;top
was put to all the annuities granted at Mar&s;eilles on &s;ums
borrowed for the u&s;e of the marine. Be&s;ides the con|&s;iderable
&s;avings occa&s;ioned by the&s;e acts of &s;tate bank|ruptey,
they had re&s;ources of credit among the merchants
of Holland, who beheld the &s;ucce&s;s of Great-Britain with
an eye of jealou&s;y; and were moreover in&s;lamed again&s;t
her with the mo&s;t rancorous re&s;entment, on account of
the captures which had been made of their We&s;t-India
&s;hips by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. In the month of February, the merchants
of Am&s;terdam, having received advice that the cargoes of
their We&s;t-India &s;hips, detained by the Engli&s;h, would,
by the Briti&s;h courts of judicature, be declared lawful
prizes, as being French property, &s;ent a deputation, with
a petition to the States-General, entreating them to u&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="116">
their interce&s;&s;ion with the court of London, repre&s;enting
the impo&s;&s;ibility of furni&s;hing the proofs required in &s;o
&s;hort a time as that pre&s;cribed by the Briti&s;h Admiralty;
and that, as the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatia had but one road,
and there was no other way of taking in cargoes but that
of Over&s;chippen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The method called Over&s;chippen is that of u&s;ing French boats to load $utch ve&s;&s;els with the produce of France.</NOTE>, to which the Engli&s;h had objected, a
condemnation of the&s;e &s;hips, as legal prizes, would give
the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the trade of the colony. Whatever
remon&s;trances the States-General might have made on
this &s;ubject to the mini&s;try of Great-Britain, they had no
effect upon the proceedings of the court of Admiralty,
which continued to condemn the cargoes of the Dutch
&s;hips as often as they were proved to be French property;
and this re&s;olute uniformity in a little time intimidated the
&s;ubjects of Holland from per&s;evering in this illicit branch
of commerce. The enemies of England in that republick,
however, had &s;o far prevailed, that in the beginning of
the year the &s;tates of Holland had pa&s;&s;ed a formal
re&s;olution to equip five-and-twenty &s;hips of war; and or|ders
were immediately di&s;patched to the officers of Admi|ralty
to complete the armament with all po&s;&s;ible expe|dition.
In the month of April, the States-General &s;ent
over to London three mini&s;ters extraordinary, to make
repre&s;entations, and remove, if po&s;&s;ible, the cau&s;es of mis|under&s;tanding
that had ari&s;en between Great-Britain and
the United Provinces. They delivered their credentials
to the King, with a formal harangue: they &s;aid his
Maje&s;ty would &s;ee, by the contents of the letter they had
the honour to pre&s;ent, how ardently their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es
de&s;ired to cultivate the &s;incere friend&s;hip which had
&s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for
their common welfare and pre&s;ervation: they expre&s;&s;ed an
earne&s;t wi&s;h that they might be happy enough to remove
tho&s;e difficulties which had for &s;ome time &s;truck at this
friend&s;hip, and cau&s;ed &s;o much prejudice to the principal
&s;ubjects of the Republick: who, by the commerce they
<PB N="114" REF="117">
carried on, con&s;tituted its greate&s;t &s;trength, and chief
&s;upport. They declared their whole confidence was
placed in his Maje&s;ty's equity, for which the Republick
had the highe&s;t regard, and in the good-will he had al|ways
expre&s;&s;ed towards a &s;tate which, on all occa&s;ions, had
intere&s;ted it&s;elf in promoting his glory; a &s;tate which was
the guardian of the precious tru&s;t be queathed by a prince&s;s &s;o
dear to his affection.&mdash;&startq;Full of this confidence (&s;aid they)
we pre&s;ume to flatter our&s;elves that your Maje&s;ty will be
graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to li&s;ten to our ju&s;t demands; and we
&s;hall endeavour, during the cour&s;e of our mini&s;try, to
merit your approbation, in &s;trengthening the bonds by
which the two nations ought to be for ever united.&endq; In
an&s;wer to this oration, the King a&s;&s;ured them that he had
always regarded their High Mightine&s;&s;es as his be&s;t
friends. He &s;aid, if difficulties had ari&s;en concerning
trade, they ought to be con&s;idered as the con&s;equences of
a burthen&s;ome war which he was obliged to wage with
France. He de&s;ired they would a&s;&s;ure their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es,
that he &s;hould endeavour, on his part, to remove
the ob&s;tacles in que&s;tion, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction,
that they (the deputies) were come over with the &s;ame
di&s;po&s;ition. What repre&s;entations the&s;e deputies made,
further than complaints of &s;ome irregularities in the con|duct
of the Briti&s;h &s;ea-officers, we cannot pretend to &s;pe|cify:
but as the &s;ubject in di&s;pute related entirely to the
practice of the courts of judicature, it did not fall properly
under the cognizance of the government, which hath no
right to interfere with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. In
all probability, the &s;ubjects of Holland were by no means
plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of this negociation, for they mur|mured
again&s;t the Engli&s;h nation without cea&s;ing. They
threatened and complained by turns, and eagerly &s;ei&s;ed
all opportunities of di&s;playing their partiality in favour
of the enemies of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. In the month of September Major-Gene|ral
Yorke, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at the Hague, pre&s;ented a
memorial to the States-General, remon&s;trating, that the
merchants of Holland carried on a contraband trade in
<PB N="115" REF="118">
favour of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> by tran&s;porting cannon and warlike
&s;tores from the Baltic to Holland, in Dutch bottoms,
under the borrowed names of private per&s;ons; and then
conveying them by the inland rivers and canals, or through
the Dutch fortre&s;&s;es, to Dunkirk, and other places of
France. He de&s;ired that the King his ma&s;ter might be
made ea&s;y on that head, by their putting an immediate
&s;top to &s;uch practices, &s;o repugnant to the connexions
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting by treaty between Great Britain and the United
Province, as well as to every idea of neutrality. He ob|&s;erved
that the attention which his Maje&s;ty had lately
given to their repre&s;entations again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es of the
Engli&s;h privateers, by procuring an act of parliament
which laid them under proper re&s;trictions, gave him a
good title to the &s;ame regard on the part of their High
Mightine&s;&s;es. He reminded them that their trading towns
felt the good effects of the&s;e re&s;trictions; and that the
freedom of navigation which their &s;ubjects enjoyed amid&s;t
the troubles and di&s;tractions of Europe had con&s;iderably
augmented their commerce. He ob&s;erved, that &s;ome re|turn
ought to be made to &s;uch &s;olid proofs of the King's
friend&s;hip and moderation; at lea&s;t, the merchants, who
were &s;o ready to complain of England, ought not be coun|tenanced
in exce&s;&s;es which would have ju&s;tified the mo&s;t
rigorous examination of their conduct. He recalled to
their memories, that, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent
war, the King had &s;everal times applied to their High
Mightine&s;&s;es, and to their mini&s;ters, on the liberty they
had given to carry &s;tores through the fortre&s;&s;es of the
republick for the u&s;e of France, to invade the Briti&s;h do|minions;
and though his Maje&s;ty had pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence
many of the&s;e in&s;tances of complai&s;ance to his enemy, he
was no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the injury; but he cho&s;e rather to
be a &s;ufferer him&s;elf, than to encrea&s;e the embarra&s;&s;ment
of his neighbours, or extend the flames of war. He took
notice, that even the court of Vienna had, upon more than
one occa&s;ion, employed its intere&s;t with their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es,
and &s;ent its name to obtain pa&s;&s;es for warlike &s;tores
<PB N="116" REF="119">
and provi&s;ions for the French troops, under colour of the
Barrier-Treaty, which it no longer ob&s;erved: nay, after
having put France in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of O&s;tend and Nieuport,
in manife&s;t violation of that treaty, and without any re|gard
to the rights which they and the King his ma&s;ter
had acquired in that treaty, at the expen&s;e of &s;o much
blood and trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The memorial &s;eems to have made &s;ome
impre&s;&s;ion on the States-General, as they &s;crupled to al|low
the artillery and &s;tores belonging to the French King
to be removed from Am&s;terdam: but the&s;e &s;cruples va|ni&s;hed
entirely on the receipt of a counter-memorial pre|&s;ented
by the Count d'A&s;&s;ry, the French amba&s;&s;ador,
who mingled &s;ome effectual threats with his expo&s;tulation.
He de&s;ired them to remember, that, during the whole
cour&s;e of the war, the French King had required nothing
from their friend&s;hip that was incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;$
impartiality: and if he deviated from the engagements
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the republick, it was only by
granting the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and lucrative favours to the
&s;ubjects of their High Mightine&s;&s;es. He ob&s;erved that
the Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;olence of their beha|viour
to the republick, had derived, on many occa&s;ions,
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the protection their effects had found in
the territories of the United Provinces; that the artillery,
&s;tores and ammunition belonging to We&s;&s;el were depo&s;ited
in their territories, which the Hanoverian army in pa&s;&s;ing
the Rhine had very little re&s;pected: that when they re|pa&s;&s;ed
that river, they had no other way of &s;aving their
&s;ick and wounded from the hands of the French, than by
embarking them in boats, and conveying them to places
where the French left them unmole&s;ted, actuated by their
re&s;pect for the neutrality of the republick: that part of
their magazines was &s;till depo&s;ited in the towns of the
United Provinces; where al&s;o the enemies of France had
purcha&s;ed and contracted for very con&s;iderable quantities
of gunpowder. He told them, that though the&s;e and &s;eve|ral
other circum&s;tances might have been made the &s;ubject
<PB N="117" REF="120">
of the ju&s;te&s;t complaints, the King of France did not
think it proper to require that the freedom and indepen|dency
of the &s;ubjects of the republic &s;hould be re&s;trained
in branches of commerce that were not incon&s;i&s;tent with
its neutrality, per&s;uaded that the faith of an engagement
ought to be inviolably pre&s;erved, though attended with
&s;ome accidental and tran&s;ient di&s;advantage; he gave
them to under&s;tand, that the King his ma&s;ter had ordered
the generals of his army carefully to avoid encroaching
on the territory of the republick, and transferring thither
the theatre of the war, when his enemies retreated that way
before they were forced to repa&s;s the Rhine. After &s;uch
unque&s;tionable marks of regard, he &s;aid, his king would
have the ju&s;te&s;t ground of complaint, if, contrary to ex|pectation,
he &s;hould hear that the artillery and &s;tores be|longing
to him were detained at Am&s;terdam. Thirdly,
he declared that &s;uch detention would be con&s;trued as a
violation of the neutrality; and demanded, in the name
of the king his ma&s;ter, that the artillery and &s;tores &s;hould,
without delay, be forwarded to Flanders by the canals of
Am&s;terdam and the inland navigation. This la&s;t argu|ment
was &s;o conclu&s;ive, that they immediately granted
the nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports, in con&s;equence of which the can|non
were conveyed to the Au&s;trian Netherlands.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The powers in the &s;outhern parts of Europe were
too much engro&s;&s;ed with their own concerns to intere&s;t
them&s;elves deeply in the quarrels that di&s;tracted the German
empire. The King of Spain, naturally of a melancho $
complexion and delicate con&s;titution, was &s;o deeply
affected with the lo&s;s of his Queen, who died in the cour&s;e
of the preceding year, that he renounced all company,
neglected all bu&s;ine&s;s, and immured him&s;elf in a chamber
at Villa-Vicio&s;a, where he gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t ex|travagant
&s;orrow. He ab&s;tained from food and re&s;t until
his &s;trength was quite exhau&s;ted. He would neither &s;hift
him&s;elf, nor allow his beard to be &s;haved: he rejected all
attempts of con&s;olation, and remained deaf to the mo&s;t
earne&s;t and re&s;pectful remon&s;trances of tho&s;e who had a
<PB N="118" REF="121">
right to tender their advice. In this ca&s;e, the affliction
of the mind mu&s;t have been re-enforced by &s;ome peculia|rity
in the con&s;titution. He inherited a melancholy taint
from his father, and this &s;eems to have been dreaded as a
family di&s;ea&s;e; for the Infant Don Louis, who likewi&s;e
re&s;ided at the palace of Villa-Vicio&s;a, was fain to amu&s;e
him&s;elf with hunting, and other diver&s;ions, to provent
his being infected with the King's di&s;order, which con|tinued
to gain ground, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of
medicine. The Spani&s;h nation, naturally &s;uper&s;titious,
had recour&s;e to &s;aints and relicks; but they &s;eemed in|&s;en&s;ible
to all their devotion. The King, however, in
the mid&s;t of all his di&s;tre&s;s, was prevailed upon to make
his will, which was written by the Count de Valparai&s;o,
and &s;igned by the Duke de Bejar, high-chancellor of the
kingdom. The exorbitancy of his grief, and the mor|tifications
he underwent, &s;oon produced an incurable
malady, under which he langui&s;hed from the month of
September in the preceding year till the tenth of Augu&s;t
in the pre&s;ent, when he expired. In his will he had ap|pointed
his brother Don Carlos, King of Naples, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
to the crown of Spain; and nominated the Queen
Dowager as regent of the kingdom, until that prince &s;hould
arrive. Accordingly, &s;he a&s;&s;umed the reins of govern|ment,
and gave directions for the funeral of the de$$a&s;ed
king, who was interred with great pomp in the church
belonging to the convent of the Vi&s;itation at Madrid.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. As the death of this prince had been long ex|pected,
&s;o the politicians of Europe had univer&s;ally prog|no&s;ticated
that his demi&s;e would be attended with great
commotions in Italy. It had been agreed among the
&s;ub&s;cribing powers to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, that
in ca&s;e Don Carlos &s;hould be advanced in the cour&s;e of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Spain, his brother Don l'hilip
&s;hould &s;ucceed him on the throne of Naples; and the
duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Gua&s;talla, which now

of his elder&punc; brother; but retained both kingdoms, with|out
minding the claims of the Empre&s;s-Queen, who, he
knew, was at that time in no condition to &s;upport her pre|ten&s;ions.
Thus the German war proved a circum&s;tance
very favourable to his intere&s;t and ambition. Before he
embarked for Spain, however, he took &s;ome extraordina|ry
&s;teps, which evinced him a &s;ound politician and &s;agaci|ous
legi&s;lator. His elde&s;t &s;on Don Philip, who had now at|tained

1. Though his Royal Highne&s;s Don Philip is thirteen years old, he is of low &s;tature, and yet the King his father, and the Queen his mother, are both of a very proper height.
2. His Royal Highne&s;s has &s;ome contraction in his joints, though he can readily move, and make u&s;e of them on all occa&s;ions.
3. His Royal Highne&s;s is apt to &s;toop and hold down his head, as peo|ple of weak eyes often do.
4. The prince mo&s;t evidently &s;quints, and his eyes frequently water and are gummy, particularly his left eye: though we cannot &s;ay he is blind, but are rather certain of the contrary, as his Royal Highne&s;s can without doubt di&s;|tingui&s;h objects, both as to their colour and &s;ituation.
5. In his natural functions, and the mo&s;t common &s;en&s;ations, he is &s;ome|times indifferent to things that are convenient for him, and at other times is too warm and impetuous. In general, his pa&s;&s;ions are not re&s;trained by rea&s;on.
6. The prince has an ob&s;tinate aver&s;ion to &s;ome kind of common food, &s;uch as fruits, &s;weetmeats, &amp;c.
7. All &s;orts of noi&s;e or &s;ound di&s;turb and di&s;concert him; and it has the &s;ame effect whether it be &s;oft and harmonious, or har&s;h and di&s;agreeable.
8. The impre&s;&s;ions that he receives from pain or plea&s;ure are neither &s;trong nor la&s;ting, and he is utterly unacquainted with all the punctilios of polite|ne&s;s and good breeding.
9. As to facts and places, he &s;ometimes remembers them and &s;ometimes not; but he &s;eems not to have the lea&s;t idea of the my&s;teries of our holy
religion.
10. He delights in childi&s;h amu&s;ements; and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t boi&s;te|vous plea&s;e him be&s;t. He is continually changing them, and &s;hifting from one thing to another.

him from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without any regard to the pre|tended
right of primogeniture, by a &s;olemn act of abdi|cation,
and &s;ettlement of the crown of the Two Sicilies
in favour of his third &s;on, Don Ferdinend. In this extra|ordinary
act he ob&s;erves, That, according to the &s;pirit of
the treaties of this age, Europe required that the &s;ove|reignty
of Spain &s;hould be &s;eparated from that of Italy,
when &s;uch a &s;eparation could be effected without tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
the rules of ju&s;tice: that the unfortunate prince-royal
having been de&s;titute of rea&s;on and reflexion ever
&s;ince his infancy, and no hope remaining that he could
ever acquire the u&s;e of the&s;e faculties, he could not think
of appointing him to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, how agreeable &s;oever
&s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition might be to nature and his paternal
affection: he was, therefore, con&s;trained, by the Divine
Will, to &s;et him a&s;ide, in favour of his third &s;on, Don
Ferdinand, who&s;e minority obliged him to ve&s;t the manage|ment
of the&s;e realms in a regency, which he accordingly
appointed, after having previou&s;ly declared $word$-&s;on Ferdi|nand
from that time emancipated, and freed not only
from all obedience to his paternal power, but even from
all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his &s;upreme and &s;overeign authority.
He then decreed, that the minority of the prince $word$
to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies &s;hould expire with
the fifteenth year of his age, when he &s;hould act as
&s;overeign, and have the entire power of the admini&s;tration.
He next e&s;tabli&s;hed and explained the order of $word$
in the male and female line; on condition that the monar|chy
of Spain &s;hould never be united with the kingdoms of
the Two Sicilies. Finally, he transferred and made over
to the &s;aid Don Ferdinand the&s;e kingdoms, with all that
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Italy; and this ordinance, &s;igned and
&s;ealed by him&s;elf and the In&s;ant Don Ferdinand, and
counter-&s;igned by the coun&s;ellors and &s;ecretaries of &s;tate,
in quality of members of the regency, received all the
u&s;ual forms of authenticity. Don Carlos having taken
the&s;e precautions for the benefit of his third &s;on, whom
he left King of Naples, embarked with the re&s;t of his
<PB N="121" REF="124">
family on board a &s;quadron of Spani&s;h &s;hips, which con|veyed
him to Barcelona. There he landed in the month
of October, and proceeded to Madrid, where, as King of
Spain, he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of his
people. He began his reign, like a wi&s;e prince, by regu|lating
the interior oeconomy of his kingdom; by pur&s;uing
the plan adopted by his predece&s;&s;or; by retaining the
mini&s;try under who&s;e au&s;pices the happine&s;s and commerce
of his people had been extended; and, with re&s;pect to the
belligerent powers, by &s;crupulou&s;ly adhering to that neu|trality
from whence the&s;e advantages were in a great mea|&s;ure
derived.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. While he &s;erenely enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ings of
pro&s;perity, his neighbour the King of Portugal was en|gro&s;&s;ed
by a &s;pecies of employment, which, of all others,
mu&s;t be the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to a prince of &s;entiment,
who loves his people; namely, the trial and puni&s;hment of
tho&s;e con&s;pirators, by who&s;e atrocious attempt his life
had been &s;o much endangered. Among the&s;e were num|bered
&s;ome of the fir&s;t noblemen of the kingdom, irritated
by di&s;appointed ambition, inflamed by bigotry, and exa&s;|perated
by revenge. The principal con&s;pirator, Don
Jo&s;eph Ma&s;care$$as and Lenca&s;tre, Duke de Aveiro,
Marquis of Torres Novas, and Conde of Santa Cruz,
was hereditary lord-&s;teward of the King's hou&s;hold, and
pre&s;ident of the palace-court, or la&s;t tribunal of appeal
in the kingdom; &s;o that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t office at the
palace, and the &s;econd of the realm. Franci&s;co de A&s;&s;iz,
Marquis of Tavora, Conde of St. John and Alvor, was
general of the hor&s;e, and head of the third noble hou&s;e
of the Tavoras, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious family in the king|dom,
deriving their origin from the ancient Kings of
Leon; he married his own kin&s;woman, who was Marchi|o$e&s;s
of Tavora in her own right, and by this marriage
acquired the marqui&s;ate. Louis Bernardo de Tavora was
their elde&s;t &s;on, who, by virtue of a di&s;pen&s;ation from the
Pope, had e&s;pou&s;ed his own aunt, Donna There&s;a de
Tavora. Jo&s;eph Maria de Tavora, his younge&s;t brother,
<PB N="122" REF="125">
was al&s;o involved in the guilt of his parents. The third
principal concerned was Don Jeronymo de Attaide, Conde
of Attouguia, him&s;elf a relation, and married to the elde&s;t
daughter of the Marquis of Tavora. The characters
of all the&s;e per&s;onages were unblemi&s;hed and re&s;pectable,
until this machination was detected. In the cour&s;e of
inve&s;tigating this dark affair, it appeared that the Duke
de Averio had conceived a per&s;onal hatred to the King,
who had di&s;appointed him in a projected match between
his &s;on and a &s;i&s;ter of the Duke de Cadaval, a minor,
and prevented his obtaining &s;ome commanderies which the
late Duke de Aveiro had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: that this nobleman,
being determined to gratify his revenge again&s;t the per&s;on
of his &s;overeign, had exerted all his art and addre&s;s in &s;e|curing
the participation of the malcontents: that with
this view, he reconciled him&s;elf to the Je&s;uits, with whom
he had been formerly at variance, knowing they were at
this time implacably incen&s;ed again&s;t the King, who had
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them from their office of penitentiaries at court,
and branded them with other marks of di&s;grace, on ac|count
of their illegal and rebellious practices in South
America: the Duke, moreover, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into
the confidence of the Marchione&s;s of Tavora, notwith|&s;tanding
an inveterate rival&s;hip of pride and ambition,
which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two families.
Her re&s;entment again&s;t the King was inflamed by the
mortification of her pride in repeated repul&s;es, when &s;he
&s;ollicited the title of duke for her hu&s;band. Her pa&s;&s;ion$
were artfully fomented and managed by the Je&s;uits, to
whom &s;he had re&s;igned the government of her con&s;cience
and they are &s;aid to have per&s;uaded her, that it would be $
meritorious action to take away the life of a prince who
was an enemy to the church, and a tyrant to his people&punc;
She, being reconciled to the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, ex|erted
her influence in &s;uch a manner as to inveigle her
hu&s;band, her &s;ons, and &s;on-in-law into the &s;ame infa|mous
de&s;ign; and yet this lady always had been remark|able
for her piety, a&s;&s;ability, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition&punc;
<PB N="123" REF="126">
Many con&s;ultations were held by the con&s;pirators at the
colleges of the Je&s;uits, St. Antoa, and St. Roque, as well
as at the hou&s;es of the Duke and the Marquis. At la&s;t,
they re&s;olved that the King &s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; and
employed two ruffians, called Antonio Alvarez and Jo|&s;eph
Policarpio, for the execution of this de&s;ign, the
mi&s;carriage of which we have related among the tran&s;|actions
of the preceding year. In the beginning of Janu|ary,
before the circum&s;tances of the con&s;piracy were
known, the Counts de Oberas and de Ribeira Grande
were impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of St. Julian, on a &s;u&s;picion
ari&s;ing from their freedom of &s;peech. The Duche&s;s de
Aveiro, the Counte&s;s of Attouguia, and the Marchione&s;s
of Alorna, with their children, were &s;ent to different
$unneries; and eight Je&s;uits were taken into cu&s;tody.
A council being appointed for the trial of the pri&s;oners,
the particulars we have related were brought to light by
the torture; and &s;entence of death was pronounced and
executed upon the convicted criminals. Eight wheels
were fixed upon a &s;caffold, rai&s;ed in the &s;quare oppo&s;ite to
the hou&s;e where the pri&s;oners had been confined, and the
thirteenth of January was fixed for the day of execution.
Antonio Alvarez Ferreira, one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who had
fired into the King's equipage, was fixed to a &s;take at
one corner of the &s;caffold; and at the other was placed the
$$l$gies of his accomplice, Jo&s;eph Policarpio de Azevedo,
who had made his e&s;cape. The Marchione&s;s of Tavora,
being brought upon the &s;caffold between eight and nine
in the morning, was beheaded at one &s;troke, and then
covered with a linen cloth. Her two &s;ons, and her &s;on-in-law,
the Count of Attouguia, with three &s;ervants of
the Duke de Aveiro, were fir&s;t &s;trangled at one &s;take,
and afterwards broke upon wheels, where their bodies $word$
covered: but the Duke and the Marquis, as chiefs
of the con&s;piracy, were broke alive, and under went the
mo&s;t excruciating torments. The la&s;t that &s;uffered was
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in Alvarez, who being condemned to be burnt
alive, the combu&s;tibles which had been placed under the
<PB N="124" REF="127">
&s;caffold were &s;et on fire, the whole machine with their
bodies con&s;umed to a&s;hes, and the&s;e a&s;hes thrown into the
&s;ea. The e&s;tates of the three unfortunate noblemen were
confi&s;cated, and their dwelling-hou&s;es ra&s;ed to the ground.
The name of Tavora was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for ever by a publick
decree; but that of Ma&s;carenhas &s;pared, becau&s;e the
Duke de Aveiro was a younger branch of the family. A
reward of ten thou&s;and crowns was offered to any per&s;on$
who &s;hould apprehend the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in who had e&s;caped: then
the embargo was taken off the &s;hipping. The King and
royal family a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a publick <HI>Te Deum</HI> &s;ung in the
chapel of No&s;&s;a Senhora de Livramento on which oc|ca&s;ion
the King, for the &s;atisfaction of his people, waved
his handkerchief with both hands, to &s;hew he was not
maimed by the wounds he had received. If &s;uch an at|tempt
upon the life of a king was infamou&s;ly cruel and
perfidious, it mu&s;t be owned that the puni&s;hment in|flicted
upon the criminals was horrible to human nature.
The attempt it&s;elf was attended with &s;ome circum&s;tances
th$$ might have &s;taggered belief, had it not appeared but
too plain that the King was actually wounded. One
would imagine, that the Duke de Aveiro, who was charged
with de&s;igns on the crown, would have made &s;ome pre|parations
for taking advantage of the confu&s;ion and di&s;|order
which mu&s;t have been produced by the King's
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; but we do not find that any thing of this
nature was premeditated. It was no more than a de&s;pe|rate
&s;cheme of per&s;onal revenge, conceived without cau|tion,
and executed without conduct: a circum&s;tance that
more extraordinary, if we &s;uppo&s;e the con&s;pirators were
actuated by the councils of the Je&s;uits, who have been
ever famous for $$e&s;&s;e and dexterity. Be&s;ides the di&s;|covery
of all the particulars was founded upon con&s;e&s;&s;ion
extorted by the rack, which, at be&s;t, is a &s;u&s;picious evi|dence.
Be that as it will, the Portugue&s;e government,
without waiting for a bull from the Pope, &s;eque&s;tered all the
e&s;tates and effects of the Je&s;uits in that kingdom, which
amounted to con&s;iderable &s;ums, and reduced the indivi|duals
<PB N="125" REF="128">
of the &s;ociety to a very &s;canty allowance. Com|plaints
of their conduct having been made to the Pope, he appointed a congregation to examine into the affairs of
the Je&s;uits in Portugal. In the mean time, the court of
Li&s;bon ordered a con&s;iderable number of them to be em|barked
for Italy, and re&s;olved that no Je&s;uit &s;hould here|after
re&s;ide within its realms. When the&s;e tran&s;ports
arrived at Civita-Vecchia, they were, by the Pope's order,
$odged in the Dominican and Capuchin convents of that
city, until proper hou&s;es could be prepared for their recep|tion
at Tivoli and Fre&s;cati. The mo&s;t guilty of them,
however, were detained in clo&s;e pri&s;on in Portugal, re|&s;erved,
in all probability, for a puni&s;hment more adequate
to their enormities.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. England &s;till continued to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings
of peace, even amid&s;t the triumphs of war. In the month
of November the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened by
commi&s;&s;ion; and, the Commons attending in the Hou&s;e
of Peers, the Lord-Keeper harangued the parliament to
this effect: he gave them to under&s;tand that his Maje&s;ty
had directed him to a&s;&s;ure them that he thought him&s;elf
peculiarly happy in being able to convoke them in a &s;itua|tion
of affairs &s;o glorious to his crown, and advantageous
to his kingdoms: that the King &s;aw and devoutly adored
the hand of Providence, in the many &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es both
by &s;ea and land with which his arms had been ble&s;&s;ed in
the cour&s;e of the la&s;t campaign: that he reflected with
great &s;atisfaction on the confidence which the parliament
had placed in him, by making &s;uch ample provi&s;ions, and
$ntru&s;ting him with &s;uch exten&s;ive powers for carrying
on a war, which the defence of their valuable rights and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, together with the pre&s;ervation of the commerce
of his people, had rendered both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. He
$numerated the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h arms, the re|duction
of Goree on the coa&s;t of Africa, the conque&s;t of
$o many important places in America, the defeat of the
French army in Canada, the reduction of their capital city
Quebeck, effected with &s;o much honour to the courage
<PB N="126" REF="129">
and conduct of his Maje&s;ty's officers and forces, the im|portant
advantage obtained by the Briti&s;h &s;quadron of
Cape-Lagos, and the effectual blocking up for &s;o many
months the principal part of the French navy in the$
own harbours; events which mu&s;t have filled the hearts o$
all his Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects with the &s;incere&s;t joy
and convinced his parliament that there had been $word$
want of vigilance or vigour on his part, in exerting tho&s;$
means which they, with &s;o much prudence and publick
&s;pirited zeal, had put into his Maje&s;ty's hands. $word$
ob&s;erved, that the national advantages had extended ev$$
as far as the Ea&s;t-Indies, where, by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing
the dangerous de&s;igns of his Maje&s;ty's enemies had mi$$|carried,
and that valuable branch of commerce had re|ceived
great benefit and protection. That the memora|ble
victory gained over the French at Minden had lon&punc;
made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of his Maje&s;ty's peo|ple.
that if the cri&s;is in which the battle was fought, th$
&s;uperiour number of the enemy, the great and able con|duct
of his Maje&s;ty's general, Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;|wick,
were con&s;idered, that action mu&s;t be the &s;ubject o$
la&s;ting admiration and thankfulne&s;s: that if any thing
could fill the brea&s;ts of his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects with
&s;till further degrees of exultation, it would be the di|&s;tingui&s;hed
and unbroken valour of the Briti&s;h troops
owned and applauded by tho&s;e whom they overcame. He
&s;aid the glory they had gained was not merely their own
but, in a national view, was one of the mo&s;t important
circum&s;tances of our &s;ucce&s;s, as it mu&s;t be a &s;triking ad|monition
to our enemies with whom they have to contend.
He told them that his Maje&s;ty's good brother and ally, the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, attacked and &s;urrounded by &s;o many
con&s;iderable powers, had, by his magnanimity and abi|lities,
and the bravery of his troops, been able, in a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
manner, to prevent the mi&s;chiefs concerted with
&s;uch united force again&s;t him. He declared, by the com|mand
of his &s;overeign, that as his Maje&s;ty entered into
this war not from views of ambition, &s;o he did not wi&s;h to
<PB N="127" REF="130">
continue it from motives of re&s;entment: that the de&s;ire of
his Maje&s;ty's heart was to &s;ee a &s;top put to the effu&s;ion of
Chri&s;tian blood: that, whenever &s;uch terms of peace
could be e&s;tabli&s;hed as &s;hould be ju&s;t and honourable for
his Maje&s;ty and his allies; and by procuring &s;uch ad|vantages
as, from the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his Maje&s;ty's arms,
might in rea&s;on and equity be expected, &s;hould bring
along with them full &s;ecurity for the future, his Maje&s;ty
would rejoice to &s;ee the repo&s;e of Europe re&s;tored on &s;uch
&s;olid and durable foundations; and his faithful &s;ubjects,
to who&s;e liberal &s;upport and un&s;haken firmne&s;s his Ma|je&s;ty
owed &s;o much, happy in the enjoyment of the
ble&s;&s;ings of peace and tranquillity: but, in order to this
great and de&s;ireable end, he &s;aid his Maje&s;ty was confident
the parliament would agree with him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary
to make ample provi&s;ion for carrying on the war, in all
parts, with the utmo&s;t vigour. He a&s;&s;ured the Commons,
that the great &s;upplies they had granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament had been faithfully employed for the purpo&s;es
for which they were granted; but the uncommon extent
of the war, and the various &s;ervices nece&s;&s;ary to be pro|vided
for, in order to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's mea|&s;ures,
had unavoidably occa&s;ioned extraordinary expen&s;es.
Finally, he repeated the a&s;&s;urances from the throne of the
high &s;atisfaction his Maje&s;ty took in that union and
good harmony which was &s;o con&s;picuous among his good
&s;ubjects; he &s;aid, his &s;overeign was happy in &s;eeing it
continued and confirmed; he ob&s;erved, that experience
had &s;hown how much the nation owed to this union,
which alone could &s;ecure the true happine&s;s of his people.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. We &s;hall not anticipate the reader's own
$word$ by pretending to comment upon either the mat|$er
or the form of this harangue, which, however, pro|duced
all the effect which the &s;overeign could de&s;ire. The
Hou&s;es, in their re&s;pective addre&s;&s;es, &s;eemed to vie with
each other in expre&s;&s;ions of attachment and complacency.
The Peers profe&s;&s;ed their utmo&s;t readine&s;s to concur in
the effectual &s;upport of &s;uch further mea&s;ures as his Ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="128" REF="131">
in his great wi&s;dom, &s;hould judge nece&s;&s;ary or expe|dient
for carrying on the war with vigour, in all parts,
and for di&s;appointing and repelling any de&s;perate attempt$
which might be made upon the&s;e kingdoms. The Com|mons
expre&s;&s;ed their admiration of that true greatne&s;s of
mind which di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's heart, in the mid&s;t of
pro&s;perities, to wi&s;h a &s;top put to the effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian
blood, and to &s;ee tranquillity re&s;tored. They declared
their entire reliance on his Maje&s;ty's known wi&s;dom and
firmne&s;s, that this de&s;ireable object, whenever it &s;hould be
obtained, would be upon terms ju&s;t and honourable for his
Maje&s;ty and his allies; and, in order to effect that great
end, they a&s;&s;ured him they would chearfully grant &s;uch
&s;upplies as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain, and pre&s;s
with effect, all his exten&s;ive operations again&s;t the enemy.
They did not fail to re-echo the &s;peech, as u&s;ual, enume|rating
the trophies of the year, and extolling the King$
of Pru&s;&s;ia for his con&s;ummate genius, magnanimity, un|wearied
activity, and un&s;haken con&s;tancy of mind. Very
great rea&s;on, indeed, had his Maje&s;ty to be &s;atisfied with an$
addre&s;s of &s;uch a nature from a Hou&s;e of Commons, in
which oppo&s;ition lay &s;trangled at the foot of the mini&s;ter$
in which tho&s;e demagogues, who had rai&s;ed them&s;elves to
reputation and renown, by declaiming again&s;t continenta$
mea&s;ures, were become &s;o perfectly reconciled to the ob|ject
of their former reprobation, as to cultivate it even
with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m unknown to any former ad|mini&s;tration,
and lay the nation under &s;uch contributions
in its behalf as no other mini&s;try dur&s;t ever meditate&punc;
Thus di&s;po&s;ed, it was no wonder they admired the mo|deration
of their &s;overeign, in offering to treat of peace&punc;
after above a million of men had peri&s;hed by the war, and
twice that number been reduced to mi&s;ery; after whole
provinces had been depopulated, whole countries &s;ubdued$
and the victors them&s;elves almo&s;t cru&s;hed by the trophie$
they had gained.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. Immediately after the addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented $word$
the Commons re&s;olved them&s;elves into a committee o$
<PB N="129" REF="132">
the whole Hou&s;e, and having unanimou&s;ly voted a &s;upply
to his Maje&s;ty, began to take the particulars into con&s;i|deration.
This committee was continued till the twelfth
of May, when that whole bu&s;ine&s;s was accompli&s;hed.
For the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year they voted &s;eventy
thou&s;and &s;eamen; including eighteen thou&s;and three hun|dred
and fifty-five marines; and for their maintenance
allotted three millions &s;ix hundred and forty thou&s;and
pounds. The number of land forces, including the Bri|ti&s;h
troops in Germany, and the invalids, they fixed at
fifty-&s;even thou&s;and two hundred and ninety-four men,
and granted for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence one million three hundred
eighty-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-eight pounds
and ten pence. For maintaining other forces in the
plantations, Gibraltar, Guadaloupe, Africa, and the Ea&s;t-Indies,
they allowed eight hundred forty-&s;ix thou&s;and one
hundred and &s;ixty-eight pounds, nineteen &s;hillings: for
the expen&s;e of four regiments on the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment,
&s;erving in North-America, they voted thirty-five thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and forty-four pounds, eight &s;hillings,
and four-pence. For pay to the general and general
&s;taff-officers, and officers of the ho&s;pital for the land forces,
they a&s;&s;igned fifty-four thou&s;and four hundred and fifty-four
pounds, eleven &s;hillings, and nine-pence. They voted
for the expen&s;e of the militia in South and North-Britain
the &s;um of one hundred two thou&s;and and &s;ix pounds, four
&s;hillings, and eight-pence. They granted for the main|tenance
of thirty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty
men, being the troops of Hanover, Wolfen buttel, Saxe-Gotha,
and Buckebourg, retained in the &s;ervice of Great-Britain,
the &s;um of four hundred forty-&s;even thou&s;and
eight hundred eighty-two pounds, ten &s;hillings, and five-pence
half-penny; and for nineteen thou&s;and He&s;&s;ian
troops, in the &s;ame pay, they gave three hundred &s;ixty-&s;ix
thou&s;and &s;even hundred twenty-five pounds, one &s;hilling,
and &s;ix-pence. They afterwards be&s;towed the &s;um of
one hundred eight thou&s;and and twelve pounds, twelve
&s;hillings, and &s;even-pence, for defraying the additional
<PB N="130" REF="133">
expen&s;e of augmentations in the troops of Hanover and
He&s;&s;e, and the Briti&s;h army &s;erving in the Empire. For
the ordinary of the navy, including half-pay to &s;ea officers;
for carrying on the building of two ho&s;pitals, one near
Go&s;port, and the other in the neighbourhood of Ply|mouth;
for the &s;upport of the ho&s;pital at Greenwich; for
purcha&s;ing ground, erecting wharfs, and other accommo|dations
nece&s;&s;ary for refitting the fleets at Halifax, in No|va-Scotia:
for the charge of the office of Ordnance, and
defraying the extraordinary expen&s;e incurred by that office
in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, they allowed &s;even hundred
eighty-one thou&s;and four hundred and eighty-nine
pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence. Towards paying off
the navy debt, buildings, re-buildings, and repairs of the
King's &s;hips, together with the charge of tran&s;port-&s;ervice,
they granted one million &s;even hundred and one thou&s;and
&s;eventy-eight pounds, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence.
For defraying the extraordinary expen&s;es of the land|forces,
and other &s;ervices not provided for by parliament,
comprehending the pen&s;ions for the widows of reduced
officers, they allotted the &s;um of nine hundred fifty-five
thou&s;and three hundred and forty-four pounds, fifteen &s;hil|lings,
and five-pence halfpenny. They voted one million,
to empower his Maje&s;ty to di&s;charge the like &s;um, rai&s;ed
in pur&s;uance of an actmade in the la&s;t &s;ea&s;&s;ion of parliament,
and charged upon the fir&s;t aids or &s;upplies to be granted in
this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. They gave &s;ix hundred and
&s;eventy thou&s;and pounds for enabling his Maje&s;ty to make
good his engagements with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, pur&s;uant
to a new convention between him and that monarch, con|cluded
on the ninth day of November in the pre&s;ent year&punc;
Fifteen thou&s;and pounds they allowed, upon account, to|wards
enabling the principal officers of his Maje&s;ty's Ord|nance
to defray the nece&s;&s;ary charges and expen&s;es of
taking down and removing the pre&s;ent magazine for gun|powder,
&s;ituated in the neighbourhood of Greenwich, and
of erecting it in &s;ome le&s;s dangerous &s;ituation. Sixty
thou&s;and pounds they gave, to enable his Maje&s;ty to fulfill
<PB N="131" REF="134">
his engagements with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, pur|&s;uant
to the &s;eparate article of a treaty between the two
powers, renewed in the month of November; the &s;um to
be paid as his mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s &s;hould think it mo&s;t
convenient, in order to facilitate the means by which the
Landgrave might again fix his re&s;idence in his own do|minions,
and by his pre&s;ence give fre&s;h courage to his
faithful &s;ubjects. Five hundred thou&s;and pounds they
voted, upon account, as a pre&s;ent &s;upply towards defray|ing
the charges of forage, bread, bread-waggons, train of
artillery, wood, &s;traw, provi&s;ions, and contingencies of
his Maje&s;ty's combined army under the command of
Prince Ferdinand. To the Foundling-ho&s;pital they grant|ed
five thou&s;and pounds: and fifteen thou&s;and for im|proving,
widening, and enlarging the pa&s;&s;age over and
through London-bridge. To replace divers &s;ums taken
from the &s;inking-fund, they granted two hundred twenty-five
thou&s;and two hundred and eighty-one pounds, nineteen
&s;hillings, and four-pence. For the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of reduced
officers, including the allowances to the &s;everal officers
and private men of the two troops of hor&s;e-guards and
regiment of hor&s;e reduced, and to the &s;uperannuated gen|tlemen
of the four troops of hor&s;e-guards, they voted
thirty-eight thou&s;and five hundred and ninety-&s;even
pounds, nine &s;hillings. Upon account, for the &s;upport of
the colonies of Nova-Scotia and Georgia, they granted
twenty-one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred ninety-four pounds, two
&s;hillings, and two-pence. For enabling the King to give
a proper compen&s;ation to the provinces of North-Ame|rica
for the expen&s;es they might incur in levying and
maintaining troops, according as the vigour and activity
of tho&s;e re&s;pective provinces &s;hould be thought by his
Maje&s;ty to merit, they advanced the &s;um of two hundred
thou&s;and pounds. The Ea&s;t-India company they gratified
with twenty thou&s;and pounds, towards enabling them to
defray the expen&s;e of a military force in their &s;ettlements,
in lieu of a battalion of the King's troops now returned
to Ireland. Twenty-five thou&s;and pounds were provided
<PB N="132" REF="135">
for the payment of the out-pen&s;ioners of Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital.
For &s;ub&s;equent augmentations of the Briti&s;h forces, &s;ince
the fir&s;t e&s;timate of guards and garri&s;ons for the en&s;uing
year was pre&s;ented, they allowed one hundred thirty-four
thou&s;and one hundred thirty-nine pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hil|lings,
and four-pence. They further voted, upon account,
towards enabling the governours and guardians of the
Foundling-ho&s;pital to maintain, educate, and bind ap|prentice
the children admitted into the &s;aid charity, the
&s;um of forty-&s;even thou&s;and two hundred and eighty-five
pounds. For defraying the expen&s;e of maintaining the
militia in South and North-Britain, to the twenty-fourth
day of December of the en&s;uing year, they voted an ad|ditional
grant of two hundred ninety thou&s;and eight
hundred and twenty-&s;ix pounds, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, and eight-pence:
and, nio$eove$, they granted four&s;core thou&s;and
pounds, upon account, towards defraying the charge of
pay and clothing of the unembodied militia for the year,
ending on the twenty-fifth day of March, in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-one. For re-embur&s;ing
the colony of New-York their expen&s;es in furni&s;hing pro|vi&s;ions
and &s;tores to the troops rai&s;ed by them for his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ervice, in the campaign of the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, they allowed two thou&s;and
nine hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even pounds, &s;even &s;hillings, and
eight-pence: and for maintaining the Briti&s;h forts and
&s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa they renewed the grant
of ten thou&s;and pounds. For the maintenance and aug|mentation
of the troops of Brun&s;wick in the pay o$
Great-Britain, for the en&s;uing year, pur&s;uant to an ulte|rior
convention concluded and &s;igned at Paderborn, on the
fifth day of March, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and &s;ixty, they granted the &s;um of ninety thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and &s;ixty-nine pounds, eight &s;hillings, and eleven-pence
farthing; and for the troops of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el in the
&s;ame pay, during the &s;ame period, they allotted one hun|dred
and one thou&s;and ninety-&s;ix pounds, three &s;hillings,
and two-pence. For the extraordinary expen&s;es of the
<PB N="133" REF="136">
land forces, and other &s;ervices incurred, from the twenty-fourth
day of November in the pre&s;ent year to the twenty-fourth
of December following, and not provided for, they
granted the &s;um of four hundred twenty thou&s;and one hun|dred
and twenty pounds, one &s;hilling. To make good
the deficiency of the grants for the &s;ervice of this pre&s;ent
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine, they
a&s;&s;igned the &s;um of &s;eventy-five thou&s;and one hundred
and &s;eventy pounds, three pence farthing. For printing
the journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons they gave five
thou&s;and pounds; and &s;ix hundred thirty-four pounds,
thirteen &s;hillings, and &s;even-pence, as intere&s;t, at the rate of
four per centum per annum, from the twenty-fifth day of
Augu&s;t in the pre&s;ent year, to the &s;ame day of April next,
for the &s;um of twenty-three thou&s;and eight hundred pounds,
eleven &s;hillings, and eleven-pence, remaining in the office
of Ordnance, and not paid into the hands of the deputy of
the King's remembrancer of the court of Exchequer, as
directed by an act made in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament,
to make compen&s;ation for lands and hereditaments pur|cha&s;ed
for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice at Chatham, Port&s;mouth,
and Plymouth, by rea&s;on of doubts and difficulties which
had ari&s;en touching the execution of the &s;aid act. For
defraying the extraordinary charge of the Mint, during the
pre&s;ent year, they allowed eleven thou&s;and nine hundred
and forty pounds, thirteen &s;hillings, and ten-pence; and
two thou&s;and five hundred pounds, upon account, for
paying the debts claimed and &s;u&s;tained upon a forfeited
e&s;tate in North-Britain. They likewi&s;e allowed twelve
thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;eventy-four pounds, fifteen
&s;hillings, and ten-pence, for defraying the charge of a
regiment of light dragoons, and of an additional company
to the corps commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan.
Finally, they voted one million, upon account, to enable
the King to defray any extraordinary expen&s;es of the war,
incurred or to be incurred for the &s;ervice of the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty; and to take all &s;uch
mea&s;ures as might be nece&s;&s;ary to defeat any enter|pri&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="137">
or de&s;igns of his enemies, as the exigency of affair$
might require. On the whole, the &s;um total granted in
this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament amounted to fifteen millions
five hundred three thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixty-three
pounds, fifteen &s;hillings, and nine-pence halfpenny: a
&s;um &s;o enormous, whether we con&s;ider the nation that
rai&s;ed it, or the purpo&s;es for which it was rai&s;ed, that
every Briton of a &s;edate mind, attached to the intere&s;t and
welfare of his country, mu&s;t reflect upon it with equal
a&s;toni&s;hment and concern: a &s;um con&s;iderably more than
double the large&s;t &s;ub&s;idy that was granted in the reign of
Queen Anne, when the nation was in the zenith of her
glory, and retained half the powers of Europe in her pay:
a &s;um almo&s;t double of what any former admini&s;tration
dur&s;t have a&s;ked; and near double of what the mo&s;t
&s;anguine calculators who lived in the beginning of this
century thought the nation could give without the mo&s;t
imminent hazard of immediate bankruptey. Of the im|men&s;e
&s;upply which we have particulari&s;ed, the reader
will perceive that two millions three hundred forty-four
thou&s;and four hundred and eighty-&s;ix pounds, &s;ixteen
&s;hillings, and &s;even-pence three farthings were paid to
foreigners for &s;upporting the war in Germany, exclu&s;ive
of the money expended by the Briti&s;h troops in that coun|try,
the number of which amounted, in the cour&s;e of the
en&s;uing year, to twenty thou&s;and men; a number the more
extraordinary, if we con&s;ider they were all tran&s;ported to
that continent during the admini&s;tration of tho&s;e who de|clared
in parliament (the words &s;till &s;ounding in our ears) that
not a man, nor even half a man, &s;hould be &s;ent from
Great-Britain to Germany, to fight the battles of any
foreign elector. Into the expen&s;e of the German wa$
&s;u&s;tained by Great-Britain we mu&s;t al&s;o throw the charge
of tran&s;porting the Engli&s;h troops, the article of forage,
which alone amounted, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t campaign,
to one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides pon|tage,
waggons, hor&s;es, and many other contingencies.
To the German war we may al&s;o impute the extraordinary
<PB N="135" REF="138">
expen&s;e incurred by the actual &s;ervice of the militia, which
the ab&s;ence of the regular troops rendered in a great
mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary; and the lo&s;s of &s;o many hands with|drawn
from indu&s;try, from hu&s;bandry, and manufacture.
The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by this connexion was equally grievous
and apparent; the advantage accruing from it, either to
Britain or Hanover, we have not di&s;cernment &s;ufficient
to perceive, con&s;equently cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed able to
explain.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. The committee of ways and means, having
duely deliberated on the articles of &s;uppply, continued
&s;iting from the twenty-&s;econd day of November to the
fourteenth of May, during which period they e&s;tabli&s;hed
the nece&s;&s;ary funds to produce the &s;ums which had been
granted. The land-tax at four &s;hillings in the pound,
and the malt-tax, were continued, as the &s;tanding reve|nue
of Great-Britain. The whole provi&s;ion made by
the committee of ways and means amounted to &s;ixteen
millions one hundred thirty thou&s;and five hundred and
&s;ixty one pounds, nine &s;hillings, and eight pence, exceed|ing
the grants for the &s;ervice of the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;ixty in the &s;um of &s;ix hundred twenty-&s;ix
thou&s;and nine hundred ninety-&s;even pounds, thirteen
&s;hillings, and ten-pence half-penny. This exce&s;s, how|ever,
will not appear extraordinary, when we con&s;ider,
that it was de&s;tined to make good the premium of two
hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds to the &s;ub&s;cribers upon
the eight million loan, as well as the deficiencies in the
other grants, which never fail to make a con&s;iderable arti|cle
in the &s;upply of every &s;e&s;&s;ion. That the&s;e gigantick
&s;trides towards the ruin of publick credit were &s;uch as
might alarm every well-wi&s;her to his country will per|haps
more plainly appear in the &s;um total of the national
debt, which, including the incumbrance of one million
charged upon the civil li&s;t revenue, and provided for by a
tax upon &s;alaries and pen&s;ions payable out of that revenue,
amounted, at this period, to the tremendous &s;um of one
hundred eight millions four hundred ninety-three thou|&s;and

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="136" REF="141">
one hundred fifty-four pounds, fourteen &s;hillings,
and eleven-pence one farthing. A comfortable reflexion
this to a people involved in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive war that
ever was waged, and already burthened with &s;uch taxes
as no other nation ever bore.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. It is not at all nece&s;&s;ary to particulari&s;e
the acts that were founded upon the re&s;olutions touching
the &s;upply. We &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in the act for
the land tax, and in the act for the malt-tax, there was a
clau&s;e of credit, empowering the commi&s;&s;ioners of the
Trea&s;ury to rai&s;e the money which they produced by
loans on Exchequer-bills, bearing an intere&s;t of four per cent.
per annum, that is, one per cent. higher than the
intere&s;t u&s;ually granted in time of peace. While the
Hou&s;e of Commons deliberated on the bill for granting
to his Maje&s;ty &s;everal duties upon malt, and for rai&s;ing a
certain &s;um of money to be charged on the &s;aid duties, a
petition was pre&s;ented by the mal&s;ters of Ip&s;wich and parts
adjacent again&s;t an additional duty on the &s;tock of malt
in hand: but no regard was paid to this remon&s;trance;
and the bill, with &s;everal new amendments, pa&s;&s;ed through
both Hou&s;es, under the title of &startq;An act for granting to
his Maje&s;ty &s;everal duties upon malt, and for rai&s;ing the
&s;um of eight millions by way of annuities and a lottery,
to be charged on the &s;aid duties; and to prevent the frau|dulent
obtaining of allowances in the guaging of corn
making into malt; and for making forth duplicates of
Exchequer-bills, tickets, certificates receipts, annuity-orders,
and other orders lo&s;t, burned, or otherwi&s;e de|&s;troyed.&endq;
The other three bills that turned wholly on
the &s;upply were pa&s;&s;ed in common cour&s;e, without the
lea&s;t oppo&s;ition in either Hou&s;e, and received the royal
a&s;&s;ent by commi&s;&s;ion, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t
of the&s;e, intituled, &startq;A bill for enabling his Maje&s;ty to
rai&s;e a certain &s;um of money for the u&s;es and purpo&s;es
therein mentioned,&endq; contained a clau&s;e of appropriation,
added to it by in&s;truction; and the Bank was enabled to
lend the million which the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury
<PB N="137" REF="142">
were empowered-by the act to borrow, at the intere&s;t of
four pounds per cent. The &s;econd, granting to his
Maje&s;ty a certain &s;um of money out of the &s;inking fund,
for the &s;ervice of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
&s;ixty, comprehended a clau&s;e of credit for borrowing the
money thereby granted; and another clau&s;e, empowering
the Bank to lend it without any limitation of intere&s;t;
$nd the third, enabling his Maje&s;ty to rai&s;e a certain
&s;um of money towards di&s;charging the debt of the navy,
$nd for naval &s;ervices during the en&s;uing year, enacted,
that the Exchequer bills thereby to be i&s;&s;ued &s;hould not
$e received, or pa&s;s to any receiver or collector of the
publick revenue, or at the receipt of the Exchequer, be|fore
the twenty &s;ixth day of March in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-one.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. As the act of the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, pro|hibiting
the malt-di&s;tillery, was to expire at Chri&s;tmas,
the Commons, thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider of proper
methods for laying the malt-di&s;tillery under &s;uch regula|tions
as might prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, its being prejudicial
$o the health and morals of the people, began as early as
the month of November to deliberate on this affair;
which being under agitation, petitions were pre&s;ented to
the Hou&s;e by &s;everal of the principal inhabitants of Spital|$elds;
the mayor and commonalty of New Sarum; the
gentlemen, clergy, merchants, manufacturers, trade&s;men,
and other inhabitants of Colche&s;ter; the mayor, aldermen,
$nd common-council of King's Lynn in Norfolk; the
$ayor and bailif$s of Berwick upon Tweed; repre&s;enting
$e advantages acc$uing from the prohibition of the
$halt-di&s;tillery, and praying the continuance of the act
$y which it was prohibited. On the other hand, counter|$$titions
were offered by the mayor, magi&s;trates, mer|$hants,
manufacturers, and other gentlemen of the city
$f Norwich; by the land-owners and holders of the
$$uth-we&s;t part of E&s;&s;ex; and by the freeholders of the
$ires of Ro&s;s and Cromartie, in North-Britain; alledg|$g,
that the &s;carcity of corn, which had made it nece&s;&s;ary
$word$ prohibit the malt-di&s;tillery, had cea&s;ed; and that the
<PB N="138" REF="143">
continuing the prohibition beyond the nece&s;&s;ity which
had required it would be a great lo&s;s and di&s;couragement$
to the landed intere&s;t; they, therefore, prayed that the$
&s;aid di&s;tillery might be again opened, under &s;uch regula|tions
and re&s;trictions as the Hou&s;e &s;hould think proper&punc;
The&s;e remon&s;trances being taken into con&s;ideration, and
divers accounts peru&s;ed, the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly agreed
that the prohibition &s;hould be continued for a limited
time; and a bill being brought in, pur&s;uant to this re&s;o|lution,
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and received th$
royal a&s;&s;ent; by which means the prohibition of the malt&punc;
di&s;tillery was continued till the twenty-fourth day of De|cember
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ix|ty,
unle&s;s &s;uch continuation &s;hould be abridged by any
other act to be pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. The committee, having examined a gre$$

and that an additional bounty &s;hould be grante$

prevent the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, by layi$$
an additional duty thereupon; and to encourage the $word$
portation of Briti&s;h made &s;pirits. Con&s;iderable oppo&s;iti$
was made to the bill, on the opinion that the addition$$
duty propo&s;ed was too &s;mall; and that, among the re$$|lution$,
<PB N="139" REF="144">
there was not &s;o much as one that looked like a
$rovi&s;ion or re&s;triction for preventing the pernicious abu&s;e
$f &s;uch liquors. Nay, many per&s;ons affirmed, that what
was propo&s;ed looked more like a &s;cheme for increa&s;ing the
$ublick revenues, than a &s;alutary mea&s;ure to prevent ex|$e&s;s.
The merchants and manufacturers of the town of
$irmingham petitioned for &s;uch re&s;trictions. The lord|$ayor,
aldermen, and common-council of London pre|&s;ented
a petition by the hands of the two &s;heriffs, &s;etting
$orth, that the petitioners had, with great plea&s;ure, ob|&s;erved
the happy con&s;equences produced upon the morals,
$ehaviour, indu&s;try, and health of the lower cla&s;s of peo|ple,
&s;ince the prohibition of the malt-di&s;tillery: that the
$etitioners, having ob&s;erved a bill was brought in to allow
the di&s;tilling of &s;pirits from corn, were apprehen&s;ive that
$he encouragement given to the di&s;tillers thereof would
$rove detrimental to the commercial intere&s;ts of the
$ation; and they conceived the advantages propo&s;ed to be
allowed upon the exportation of &s;uch &s;pirits, being &s;o
much above the value of the commodity, would lay &s;uch a
temptation for &s;muggling and perjury as no law could
$revent. They expre&s;&s;ed their fears, that, &s;hould &s;uch a
$ill pa&s;s into a law, the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors
would not only debilitate and enervate the labourers, ma|nufacturers,
&s;ailors, &s;oldiers, and all the lower cla&s;s of
$eople, and thereby extingui&s;h indu&s;try, and that remark|$able
intrepidity which had lately &s;o eminently appeared in
the Briti&s;h nation, which mu&s;t always depend on the vi|gour
and indu&s;try of its people; but al&s;o its liberty and
happine&s;s, which can not be &s;upported without temperance
$nd morality, would run the utmo&s;t ri&s;que of being de|&s;troyed.
They declared them&s;elves al&s;o apprehen&s;ive,
$hat the extraordinary con&s;umption of bread corn by the
$till would not only rai&s;e the price, &s;o as to oppre&s;s the
$ower cla&s;s of people; but would rai&s;e &s;uch a bar to the
$xportation thereof, as to deprive the nation of a great
$n$lux of money, at that time e&s;&s;ential towards the main|taining
of an expen&s;ive war, and therefore highly injure
$he landed and commercial intere&s;t: they, therefore, prayed
<PB N="140" REF="145">
that the pre&s;ent prohibition of di&s;tilling &s;pirits from corn
might be continued, or that the u&s;e of wheat might not
be allowed in di&s;tillation. This remon&s;trance was cor|roborated
by another, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from &s;everal
merchants, manufacturers, and traders re&s;iding in and
near the city of London; and &s;eemed to have &s;ome weight
with the Commons, who made &s;everal amendments in the
bill, which they now intituled, &startq;A bill for preventing
the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, by laying addi|tional
duties thereon; for &s;hortening the prohibition for
making low wines and &s;pirits from wheat; for encourage|ing
the exportation of Briti&s;h made &s;pirits, and preventing
the fraudulent relanding or importation thereof.&endq; Thus
altered and amended, it pa&s;&s;ed on a divi&s;ion; and, making
its way through the Hou&s;e of Lords, acquired the royal
&s;anction. Whether the law be adequate to the purpo&s;es
for which it was enacted time will determine. The be&s;$
way of preventing the exce&s;s of &s;pirituous liquors woul$
be to lower the exci&s;e on beer and ale, &s;o as to enable th$
poorer cla&s;s of labourers to refre&s;h them&s;elves with a com|fortable
liquor for nearly the &s;ame expen&s;e that will pro|cure
a quantity of Geneva &s;ufficient for intoxication; fo$
it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a poor wretch will expend h$$
la&s;t penny upon a draft of &s;mall beer, without &s;trength
or the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory operation, when for the half o$
that &s;um he can purcha&s;e a cordial, that will almo&s;t in
&s;tantaneou&s;ly allay the &s;en&s;e of hunger and cold, and re$
gale his imagination with the mo&s;t agreeable illu&s;ions
Malt was at this time &s;old cheaper than it was in the fir$$
year of Kings James I. when the parliament enacted, tha$
no inn-keeper, victualler, or alehou&s;e-keeper &s;hould $word$
le&s;s than a full quart of the be&s;t ale or beer, or two quart
of the &s;mall, for one penny, under the penalty of twent$
&s;hillings. It appears, then, that in the reign of Kin$$
James the &s;ubject paid but four-pence for a gallon $word$
&s;trong beer, which now co&s;ts one &s;hilling; and as th$
malt is not increa&s;ed in value, the difference in the pri$$
mu&s;t be entirely owing to the taxes on beer, malt, an|hops,
<PB N="141" REF="146">
which are indeed very grievous, though perhaps
nece&s;&s;ary. The duty of &s;mall beer is certainly one of the
$eavie&s;t taxes impo&s;ed upon any &s;ort of con&s;umption that
$annot be con&s;idered as an article of luxury. Two bu&s;hels
of malt, and two pounds of hops, are required to make a
$arrel of good &s;mall beer, which was formerly &s;old for
$$x &s;hillings; and the taxes payable on &s;uch a barrel
$mounted to three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; &s;o that the
$um total of the impo&s;ition on this commodity was equal
$o a land tax of eleven &s;hillings and eight pence in the
$ound.</P>
<P>&sect; L. Immediately after the re&s;olution relating to the
prohibition of &s;pirits from wheat, a motion was made,
$nd leave given, to bring in a bill to continue, for a time
$$mited, the act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, permitting the import|$tion
of &s;alted beef from Ireland. This permi&s;&s;ion was
accordingly extended to the twenty-fourth day of Decem|ber,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-one.
$n all probability this &s;hort and temporary continuance
was propo&s;ed by the favourers of the bill, in order to
$void the clamour and oppo&s;ition of prejudice and igno|$ance,
which would have been dangerou&s;ly alarmed, had
$t been rendered perpetual. Yet, as undoubted evidence
$ad proved before the committee, while the bill was de|$ending,
that the importation had been of great &s;ervice
$o England, particularly in reducing the price of &s;alted
$$eef for the u&s;e of the navy, perhaps no con&s;ideration
$ought to have prevented the legi&s;lative from perpetuating
$$e law; a mea&s;ure that would encourage the gra&s;iers of
$reland to breed and fatten horned cattle, and certainly
$ut a &s;top to the practice of exporting &s;alted beef from that
$ingdom to France, which undoubtedly furni&s;hes the
$raders of that kingdom with opportunities of exporting
$ool to the &s;ame country.</P>
<P>&sect; l. I. As &s;everal lieutenants of counties had, for various
$ea&s;ons, &s;u&s;pended all proceedings in the execution of the
$$ws relating to the militia for limited times, which &s;u&s;|pen&s;ions
were deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with the intent of the
<PB N="142" REF="147">
legi&s;lature, a bill was now brought in, to enable his Ma|je&s;ty's
lieutenants of the &s;everal counties of England and
Wales to proceed in the execution of the militia laws,
notwith&s;tanding any adjournments. It was enacted,
that, as the &s;peedy execution of the laws for regulating the
militia was mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary at this juncture to
the peace and &s;ecurity of the kingdom, every lieutenant
of the place where &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion had happened &s;hould,
within one month after the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, proceed as&punc;
if there had been no &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and &s;ummon a meet|ing
for the &s;ame purpo&s;e once in every &s;ucceeding month,
until a &s;ufficient number of officers, qualified and willing
to &s;erve, &s;hould be found, or until the expiration of the
act for the better ordering the militia forces. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of a regular militia in South-Britain could not
fail to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the patriots of Scotland.
They were convinced, from rea&s;on and experience, that
nothing could more tend to the peace and &s;ecurity of their
country than &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment in North-Britain, th$
inhabitants of which had bee$ peculiarly expo&s;ed to in|&s;urrections,
which a well-regulated militia might have
prevented, or &s;ti&s;led in the birth; and their coa&s;t had been
lately alarmed by a threatened inva&s;ion, which nothing$
but the want of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment had rendered for&punc;
midable to the natives. They thought them&s;elves en|titled
to the &s;ame &s;ecurity which the legi&s;lature had pro|vided
for their fellow-&s;ubjects in South-Britain, and could
not help being unea&s;y at the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing them&s;elve
left unarmed, and expo&s;ed to injuries both foreign and do|me&s;tick,
while the &s;word was put into the hands of their
&s;outhern neighbours. Some of the members who repre|&s;ented
North-Britain in parliament, moved by the&s;e con|&s;iderations,
as well as by the earne&s;t injunctions of the$
con&s;tituents, re&s;olved to make a vigorous effort, in order
to obtain the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a regular militia in Scotlan$&punc;
In the beginning of March it was moved, and re&s;olved
that the Hou&s;e would, on the twelfth day of the month
re&s;olve it&s;elf into a committee, to con&s;ider of the laws $word$
<PB N="143" REF="148">
being which relate to the militia in that part of Great-Britain
called Scotland. The re&s;ult of that enquiry was, that
the&s;e laws were ineffectual. Then a motion was made
for leave to bring in a bill for the better ordering of the
$$ilitia forces in North-Britain, and though it met with
$reat oppo&s;ition, was carried by a large majority. The
$rincipal Scotti&s;h members of the Hou&s;e were appointed,
$word$ conjunction with others, to prepare the bill, which
$as &s;oon printed, and re-enforced by petitions pre&s;ented
$y the gentlemen, ju&s;tices of the peace, and commi&s;&s;ioners
$f the &s;upply for the &s;hire of Ayr; and by the freeholders
of the &s;hires of Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, and Forfar.
$hey expre&s;&s;ed their approbation of the e&s;tabli&s;hed militia
$word$ England, and their ardent wi&s;h to &s;ee the benefit of that
$i&s;e and &s;alutary mea&s;ure extended to North-Britain.
This was an indulgence they had the greater rea&s;on to hope
or, as by the article of the union they were undoubtedly
$ntitled to be on the &s;ame footing with their brethren of
England, and as the legi&s;lature mu&s;t now be convinced of
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ure, by the con&s;ternation
$ately produced in their defencele&s;s country, from the
$hreatened inva&s;ion of a handful of French freebooters.
The&s;e remon&s;trances had no weight with the majority in
the Hou&s;e of Commons, who, either unable or unwilling
$o make proper di&s;tinctions between the ill and well-af|fected
&s;ubjects of North-Britain, rejected the bill, as a
$$ry dangerous experiment in favour of a people among
$hom &s;o many rebellions had been generated and pro|$$ced.
When the motion was made for the bill's being
$mmitted, a warm debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which
$word$ any Scotti&s;h members &s;poke in behalf of their country
$ith great force of argument, and a very laudable &s;piri$
$f freedom. Mr. Elliot, in particular, one of the com|$i&s;&s;ioners
of the board of Admiralty, di&s;tingui&s;hed him|$$lf
by a noble flow of eloquence adorned with all the
$$aces of oratory, and warmed with the true &s;pirit of pa|$ioti&s;m.
Mr. O&s;wald, of the Trea&s;ury, acquitted him|$$lf
with great honour on the occa&s;ion; ever nervous,
<PB N="144" REF="149">
&s;teady, and &s;agacious, independent though in office, and
invariable in pur&s;uing the true intere&s;t of his country. It
mu&s;t be owned, for the honour of North-Britain, that all
her repre&s;entatives, except two, warmly contended for this
national mea&s;ure, which was carried in the negative by a
majority of one hundred and &s;ix, though the bill was ex|actly
modelled by the late act of parliament for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the militia in England.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. Even this in&s;titution, though certainly laudable
and nece&s;&s;ary, was attended with &s;o many unfore&s;een
difficulties, that every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament &s;ince it was
fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed has produced new acts for its better regu|lation.
In April, leave was given to prepare a bill for
limiting, confining, and better regulating, the payment of
the weekly allowances made by act of parliament for the
maintenance of families unable to &s;upport them&s;elves dur|ing
the ab&s;ence of militia-men embodied, and ordered out
into actual &s;ervice; as well as for amending and improv|ing
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia, and le&s;&s;ening the num|ber
of officers entitled to pay within that part of Great-Britain
called England. While this bill was under con|&s;ideration,
the Hou&s;e received a petition from the mayor,
aldermen, town-clerk, &s;heriffs, gentlemen, merchants
clergy, trade&s;men, and others, inhabitants of the ancien$
city of Lincoln, repre&s;enting, That by an act pa&s;&s;ed re|lating
to the militia, it was provided, that when any
militia-men &s;hould be ordered out into actual &s;ervice
leaving families unable to &s;upport them&s;elves during the$$
ab&s;ence, the over&s;eers of the pari&s;h where &s;uch familie$
$$&s;ide &s;hould allow them &s;uch weekly &s;upport as &s;hould
be pre&s;cribed by any one ju&s;tice of the peace, which allow|ance
&s;hould be re-embur&s;ed out of the county &s;tock&punc;
They alledged, that a con&s;iderable number of men, inha|bitants
of the &s;aid city, had entered them&s;elves to &s;erve i$
the militia of the county of Lincoln, as volunteers, fo$
&s;everal pari&s;hes and per&s;ons; yet their families were
neverthele&s;s, &s;upported by the county &s;tock of the city an$
county of the city of Lincoln. They took notice of the
<PB N="145" REF="150">
bill under deliberation, and prayed, that if it &s;hould pa&s;s
into a law they might have &s;uch relief in the premi&s;&s;es, as
to the Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem meet. Regard was had to this
petition in the amendments to the bill<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By, this law it was enacted, that if any militia-man who &s;hall have been accepted and enrolled as a &s;ub&s;titute, hired man, or volunteer, before the pa&s;&s;ing of the act, or who &s;hall have been cho&s;en by lot, whether before or after the pa&s;&s;ing of the act, &s;hall, when embodied, or called out into $word$ &s;ervice, and ordered to march, leave a family unable to &s;upport them&s;elves, the over&s;eers &s;hall, by order of &s;ome one ju&s;tice of the peace, pay, out of the poor's rates of &s;uch pari&s;h, a weekly al$$$ance to &s;uch family, according to the u&s;ual and ordinary price of labour and hu&s;bandry there; viz. for one child under the age of ten years the price of one day's labour; for two chil|dren under the age afore&s;aid the price of two days labour; for three or four children under the age afore&s;aid the price of three days labour; for five or more children under the age afore&s;aid the price of four days labour; and for the wi&s;e of &s;uch militia-man the price of one day's labour; but that the families of &s;uch m$n only as &s;hall be cho&s;en by lot, and of the &s;ub&s;titute$, hired men, and volunteers, already accepted and enrol$ed, &s;hall, after the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, receive any &s;uch weekly allowance. For removing the grievance complained of in the above petition, it is enacted, that where trea|&s;urers &s;hall re-embur&s;e to over&s;eers any mon$y, in pu$$$ance of this act, on account of the weekly allowance to the family of any nulitia-man &s;erving in the militia of any county or place other than that wherein &s;uch family &s;hall dwell, they are to tran&s;mit an account thereof, &s;igned by &s;ome ju&s;tice for the place where &s;uch family &s;hall dwell, to the trea&s;urer of the county, &amp;c. in the militia whereof &s;uch militia-man &s;hall &s;erve, who is thereupon to pay him the &s;ums &s;o re-embur&s;ed to &s;uch over&s;$$$, and the &s;ame to be allowed in his accounts.</NOTE> which pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent by
commi&s;&s;ion. During the dependance of this bill, another
was brought in, to explain &s;o much of the militia act pa&s;&s;ed
in the thirty-fir&s;t year of his Maje&s;ty's reign as related to
the money to be given to private militia men, upon their
being ordered out into actual &s;ervice. By this law it was
enacted, that the guinea, which by the former act was
due to every private man of every regiment or company of
militia, when ordered out into actual &s;ervice, &s;hould be
paid to every man that &s;hall afterwards be enrolled into
&s;uch regiment or company whil&s;t in actual &s;ervice; that
no man &s;hould be entitled to his clothes for his own u&s;e
until he &s;hould have &s;erved three years, if unembodied,
or one year, if embodied, after the delivery of the clothes;
<PB N="146" REF="151">
and that the full pay of the militia &s;hould commence from
the date of his Maje&s;ty's warrant for drawing them out&punc;
The difficulties which the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive regulations were
made to obviate will be amply recompen&s;ed by the good
effects of a national militia, provided it be employed in a
national way, and for national purpo&s;es: but if the mi|litia
are embodied, and the different regiments that com|po&s;e
it are marched from the re&s;pective counties to which
they belong; if the men are detained for any length of
time in actual &s;ervice, at a di&s;tance from their families,
when they might be employed at home in works of in|du&s;try,
for the &s;upport of their natural dependants, the
militia becomes no other than an addition to, or augmen|tation
of a &s;tanding army, inli&s;ted for the term of three
years. The labour of the men is lo&s;t to the community&punc;
they contract the idle habits and di&s;&s;olute manners of the
other troops; their families are left as incumbrances on
the community, and the charge of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is, at
lea&s;t, as heavy as that of maintaining an equal number
of regular forces. It would not, we apprehend, be very
ea&s;y to account for the government's ordering the regiments
of militia to march from their re&s;pective counties, and to
do duty for a con&s;iderable length of time at a great
di&s;tance from their own homes, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e this
mea&s;ure was taken to create in the people a di&s;gu&s;t to the
in&s;titution of the militia, which was an e&s;tabli&s;hment
extorted from the &s;ecretary by the voice of the nation.
We may add, that &s;ome of the inconveniencies attending a
militia will never be totally removed while the per&s;ons
drawn by lot for that &s;ervice are at liberty to hire &s;ub&s;ti|tutes;
for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that men of &s;ub&s;tance
will incur the danger, fatigue, and damage of &s;erving in
per&s;on, while they can hire among the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of peo|ple
mercenaries of de&s;perate fortune and abandoned
morals, who will greedily &s;ei&s;e the opportunity of being
paid for renouncing that labour by which they were be|fore
obliged to maintain them&s;elves and their family con|nexion:
it would, therefore, de&s;erve the con&s;ideration of
<PB N="147" REF="152">
the legi&s;lature, whether the privilege of hiring &s;ub&s;titutes
&s;hould not be limited to certain cla&s;&s;es of men, who are
either rai&s;ed by their rank in life above the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;erving in per&s;on, or engaged in &s;uch occupations as cannot
be intermitted without prejudice to the commonwealth.
It mu&s;t be allowed, that the regulation in this new act, by
which the families of &s;ub&s;titutes are deprived of any relief
from the pari&s;h, will not only dimini&s;h the burthen of the
poor's rates; but al&s;o, by rai&s;ing the price of mercenaries,
oblige a greater number of the better &s;ort to &s;erve in per|&s;on.
Without all doubt, the fewer &s;ub&s;titutes that are
employed, the more dependence may be placed upon the
militia in the pre&s;ervation of our rights and privileges,
and the more will the number of the di&s;ciplined men be
increa&s;ed, becau&s;e, at the expiration of every three years,
the lot-men mu&s;t be changed, and new militia-men
cho&s;en; but the &s;ub&s;titutes will, in all probability, con|tinue
for life in the &s;ervice, provided they can find lot-men
to hire them at every rotation. The reader will forgive
our being &s;o circum&s;tantial upon the regulations of an in|&s;titution
which we cannot help regarding with a kind of
enthu&s;ia&s;tick affection.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. In the latter end of November the Hou&s;e of
Commons received a petition from &s;everal noblemen, gen|tlemen,
and others, inhabitants of Ea&s;t-Greenwich, and
places adjacent, in Kent, repre&s;enting, that in the &s;aid pa|ri&s;h,
within a quarter of a mile of the town di&s;tingui&s;hed
by a royal palace, and royal ho&s;pital for &s;eamen, there was
a magazine, containing great quantities of gunpowder,
frequently to the amount of &s;ix thou&s;and barrels: that,
be&s;ides the great danger which mu&s;t attend all places of
that kind, the &s;aid magazine &s;tood in an open field, un|enclo&s;ed
by any fortification or defence what&s;oever, con|&s;equently
expo&s;ed to treachery and every other accident.
They alledged, that if, through treachery, lightning, or
any other accident, this magazine &s;hould take fire, not
only their lives and properties, but the palace and ho&s;pital,
the King's yards and &s;tores at Deptford and Woolwich,
<PB N="148" REF="153">
the banks and navigation of the Thames, with the &s;hips
&s;ailing and at anchor in that river, would be inevitably
de&s;troyed, and inconceivable damage would accrue to the
cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. They, moreover,
ob&s;erved that the magazine was then in a dangerous con|dition,
&s;upported on all &s;ides by props that were decayed at
the foundation; that, in ca&s;e it &s;hould fall, the powder
would, in all probability, take fire, and produce the dread|ful
calamities above recited: they, therefore, prayed that
the magazine might be removed to &s;ome more convenient
place, where any accident would not be attended with
&s;uch di&s;mal con&s;equences. The &s;ubject of this remon|&s;trance
was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and important, that a committee
was immediately appointed to take the affair into con&s;i|deration,
and procure an e&s;timate for purcha&s;ing lands,
and erecting a powder-magazine, at Purfleet, in E&s;&s;ex, near
the banks of the river, together with a guard-hou&s;e, bar|racks,
and all other nece&s;&s;ary conveniencies. While the
report of the committee lay upon the table for the peru&s;al
of the members, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, by his
Maje&s;ty's command, acquainted the Hou&s;e, that the King,
having been informed of the &s;ubject matter of the petition,
recommended it to the con&s;ideration of the Commons.
Leave was immediately given to prepare a bill, founded on
the re&s;olutions of the committee; which, having been
duely con&s;idered, altered, and amended, pa&s;&s;ed through
both hou&s;es to the foot of the throne, where it obtained
the royal &s;anction. The magazine was accordingly re|moved
to Purfleet, an incon&s;iderable and &s;olitary village,
where there will be little danger of accident, and where no
great damage would attend an explo&s;ion: but, in order to
render this po&s;&s;ible explo&s;ion &s;till le&s;s dangerous, it would
be nece&s;&s;ary to form the magazine of &s;mall di&s;tinct apart|ments,
totally independent of each other, that, in ca&s;e one
&s;hould be accidentally blown up, the re&s;t might &s;tand un|affected.
The &s;ame plan ought to be adopted in the con|&s;truction
of all combu&s;tible &s;tores &s;ubject to con&s;lagration.
The matine bill, and mutiny bill, as annual regulations,
<PB N="149" REF="154">
were prepared in the u&s;ual form, pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es
without oppo&s;ition, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; LIV. The next affair that engro&s;&s;ed the deliberation
of the Commons was a mea&s;ure relating to the internal
oeconomy of the metropolis. The &s;heriffs of London de|livered
a petition from the lord-mayor, aldermen, and com|mons,
in common-council a&s;&s;embled, repre&s;enting, that
&s;everal &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;&s;ages within the city of Lon|don,
and liberties thereof, were too narrow and incom|modious
for the pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing as well of foot pa&s;|&s;engers
as of coaches, carts, and other carriages, to the
prejudice and inconvenience of the owners and inhabitants
of hou&s;es, and to the great hinderance of bu&s;ine&s;s, trade,
and commerce. They alledged, that the&s;e defects might
be remedied, and &s;everal new &s;treets opened within the
&s;aid city and liberties, to the great ea&s;e, &s;afety, and conve|nience
of pa&s;&s;engers, as well as to the advantage of the
publick in general, if they, the petitioners, were enabled
to widen and enlarge the narrow &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;|&s;ages,
to open and lay out &s;uch new &s;treets and ways, and
to purcha&s;e the &s;everal hou&s;es, buildings, and grounds
which might be nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e purpo&s;es. They took
notice, that there were &s;everal hou&s;es within the city and
liberties, partly erected over the ground of other pro|prietors;
and others, of which the &s;everal floors or apart|ments
belonged to different per&s;ons; &s;o that difficulties
and di&s;putes frequently aro&s;e among&s;t the &s;aid &s;everal
owners and proprietors about pulling down or re-build|ing
the party-walls and premi&s;&s;es; that &s;uch re-building
was often prevented or delayed, to the great injury and
inconvenience of tho&s;e owners who were de&s;irous to re|build;
that it would, therefore, be of publick benefit,
and frequently prevent the &s;preading of the fatal effects of
fire, if &s;ome provi&s;ion were made by law, as well for de|termining
&s;uch di&s;putes in a &s;ummary way, as for explain|ing
and amending the laws then in being relating to the
building of party-walls. They, therefore, prayed that
leave might be given to bring in a bill for enabling the
<PB N="150" REF="155">
petitioners to widen and enlarge the &s;everal &s;treets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1759.</NOTE> lanes,
and pa&s;&s;ages, and to open new &s;treets and ways to be there
in limited and de&s;cribed; as well as for determining, in
a &s;ummary way, all di&s;putes ari&s;ing about the re-building
of hou&s;es or tenements within the &s;aid city and liberties,
wherein &s;everal per&s;ons have an intermixed property; and
for explaining and amending the laws in being relating to
the&s;e particulars. A committee being appointed to ex|amine
the matter of this petition, agreed to a report, upon
which leave was given to prepare a bill, and this was
brought in accordingly. Next day a great number of
citizens repre&s;ented, in another petition, that the pavement
of the city and liberties was often damaged, by being
broken up for the purpo&s;es of amending or new-laying
water-pipes belonging to the proprietors of water-works;
and praying that provi&s;ion might be made in the bill then
depending to compel tho&s;e proprietors to make good any
damage that &s;hould be done to the pavement by the leaking
or bur&s;ting of the water-pipes, or opening the pavement
for alterations. In con&s;equence of this repre&s;entation,
&s;ome amendments were made in the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es, and was enacted into a law, under
the title &s;tartq;An act for widening certain &s;treets, lanes,
and pa&s;&s;ages, within the city of London and liberties
thereof; and for opening certain new &s;treets and ways
within the &s;ame, and for other purpo&s;es therein men|tioned<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The openings to be made, and the pa&s;&s;ages to be improved and enlarged were a&s;certained by two &s;chedules, annexed to the act. With re&s;pect to the hou&s;es, buildings, and grounds to be purcha&s;ed, the mayor, aldermen, a$ commons of the city, in common-council a&s;&s;embled, or a committee appoint|ed by them, were empowered to fix the price by agreement with the re&s;pectiv$ proprietors, or otherwi&s;e by a jury, in the u&s;ual manner. With regard: party-walls, the act ordains, that the proprietor of either adjoining $word$ may comp$$ the proprietor of the other to agree to its being pu&s;&s;ed down $word$ rebuilt, and to pay a moi$ty of the expen&s;e, even though it &s;hould not nece&s;&s;ary to pull down or rebuild either of their hou&s;es: that all party-wall &s;hall be at lea&s;t two bricks and a half in thickne&s;s in the cellar, and two back thick upwards, to the top of the garret-floor. It enacts, that if any deca$$$ hou&s;e belongs to &s;everal proprietors, any one of them, who is de&s;irous to rebu$$ may oblige the others to concur, and join with him in the expen&s;e, or purcha&s;e their &s;hares at a price to be fixed by a jury. If any hou&s;e &s;hould hereafter be pre&s;ented by any inque&s;t, or grand jury, in London, as being in a ruinous condition, the court of mayor and aldermen is, by this act, em|powered to pull it down at the expen&s;e of the ground-landlord. As to da|maged pavements, not &s;ufficiently repaired by the proprietors of the water|works, any ju&s;tice of the peace in London is ve&s;ted with power, upon their refu&s;ing or delaying to make it good, to cau&s;e it to be effectually relayed with good materials at their expen&s;e.</NOTE>&endq;</P>

&sect; LV. The inhabitants of We&s;tmin&s;ter had long la|boured
under the want of a fi&s;h-market,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE> and complained
that the price of this &s;pecies of provi&s;ion was kept up at
an exorbitant rate by the fraudulent combination of a few
dealers, who engro&s;&s;ed the whole market at Billin&s;gate,
and de&s;troyed great quantities of fi&s;h, in order to enhance
the value of tho&s;e that remained. An act of parliament
had pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-&s;econd year of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty's
reign, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a free market for the &s;ale of
fi&s;h in We&s;tmin&s;ter; and, &s;even years after that period,
it was found nece&s;&s;ary to procure a &s;econd, for explaining
and amending the fir&s;t: but neither effectually an&s;wered
the purpo&s;es to the legi&s;lature. In the month of January
of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion the Hou&s;e took into con&s;ideration a
petition of the &s;everal fi&s;hermen trading to Billing&s;gate-market,
repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips to which they were ex|po&s;ed
by the &s;aid acts; particularly forfeitures of ve&s;&s;els
and cargoes, incurred by the negligence of &s;ervants, who
had omitted to make the particular entries which the two
acts pre&s;cribed. This petition being examined by a com|mittee,
and the report being made, leave was given to
bring in a new bill, which &s;hould contain effectual pro|vi&s;ion
for the better &s;upplying the cities of London and
We&s;tmin&s;ter with fi&s;h, and for preventing the abu&s;es of
the fi&s;hmongers. It was entitled, &startq;A bill to repeal &s;o
much of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-ninth of George II.
concerning a free market for fi&s;h at We&s;tmin&s;ter as re|quires
fi&s;hermen to enter their fi&s;hing-ve&s;&s;els at the office
of the &s;earcher of the Cu&s;toms at Grave&s;end, and to regulate
the &s;ale of fi&s;h at the fir&s;t hand in the fi&s;h-markets in Lon|don
and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and to prevent &s;ale&s;men of $i&s;h
<PB N="152" REF="157">
buying fi&s;h to &s;ell again on their own account; and to
allow bret and turbot, brill and pearl, although under the
re&s;pective dimen&s;ions mentioned in a former act, to be im|ported
and &s;old; and to puni&s;h per&s;ons who &s;hall take or
&s;ell any &s;pawn, brood, or fi&s;h of fry, un&s;izeable fi&s;h, or
fi&s;h out of &s;ea&s;on, or &s;melts under the &s;ize of five inches,
and for other purpo&s;es.&endq; Though this and the former
bill, relating to the &s;treets and hou&s;es of London, are
in&s;tances that evince the care and attention of the legi&s;|lature,
even to minute particulars of the internal oeconomy
of the kingdom, we can hardly con&s;ider them as objects
of &s;uch dig$ity and importance as to demand the delibera|tions
of the parliament, but think they naturally fall with|in
the cognizance of the municipal magi&s;tracy. After all,
perhaps the mo&s;t effectual method for &s;upplying We&s;t|min&s;ter
with plenty of fi&s;h, at rea&s;onable rates, would be
to execute with rigour the laws already enacted again&s;t
fore&s;talling and regrating; an expedient that would &s;oon
di&s;&s;olve all monopolies and combinations among the
traders; to increa&s;e the number of markets in London
and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and to e&s;tabli&s;h two general markets at
the Nore, one on each &s;ide of the river, where the fi&s;hing-ve&s;&s;els
might unload their cargoes, and return to &s;ea with|out
delay. A number of light boats might be employed
to convey fre&s;h fi&s;h from the&s;e marts to London and We&s;t|min&s;ter,
where all the different fi&s;h-markets might be
plentifully &s;upplied at a rea&s;onable expen&s;e; for it cannot
be &s;uppo&s;ed, that while the fre&s;h i&s;h are brought up the
river in the fi&s;hing-&s;macks them&s;elves, which can hardly
&s;ave their tides to Billing&s;gate, they will ever dream of
carrying their cargoes above bridge; or that the price of
fi&s;h can be con&s;iderably lowered, while the fi&s;hing-ve&s;&s;els
lo&s;e &s;o much time in running up to Grave&s;end or Bil|ling&s;gate.</P>
<P>&sect; LVI. The annual committee being appointed to en|quire
what laws were expired, or near expiring, agreed to
certain re&s;olutions; upon which a bill was prepared, and
obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, importing a continuation of
<PB N="153" REF="158">
&s;everal laws, namely, the &s;everal clau&s;es mentioned of the
acts in the fifth and eighth of George I. again&s;t the clan|de&s;tine
running of uncu&s;tomed goods, except the clau&s;es
relating to quarentine; the act pa&s;&s;ed in the third of
George II. relating to the carrying rice from Carolina;
the act in the &s;eventh of the &s;ame reign, relating to co|$chineal
and indigo; and that of the twelfth of George II.
&s;o far as it related to the importation of printed books.
There was al&s;o a law enacted, to continue to the twenty-ninth
day of September, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even, an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twelfth year
of Queen Anne, for encouraging the making of &s;ail-cloth,
by a duty of one penny per $ll laid upon all foreign made
&s;ails and &s;ail-cloth imported, and a bounty in the &s;ame
proportion granted upon all home-made &s;ail-cloth and
canvas fit for, or made into &s;ails, and exported; another
act was pa&s;&s;ed, for continuing certain laws relating to the
additional number of one hundred hackney coaches and
chairs, which law was rendered perpetual. The next law
we &s;hall mention was intended to be one of the mo&s;t im|portant
that ever fell under the cognizance of the legi|&s;lature:
it was a law that affected the freedom, dignity,
and independency of parliament. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in the
ninth year of the reign of Queen Anne it was provided
that no per&s;on &s;hould be cho&s;en a member of parliament
who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s in England or Wales an e&s;tate, free|hold
or copyhold, for life, according to the following
qualifications: for every knight of a &s;hire &s;ix hundred
pounds per annum, over and above what will &s;atisfy all
$ncumbrances; and three hundred pounds per annum
for every citizen, burge&s;s, and baron of the cinque-ports.
It was al&s;o decreed, that the return of any per&s;on not thus
qualified &s;hould be void; and that every candidate &s;hould,
at the rea&s;onable reque&s;t of any other candidate at the time
of election, or by two or more per&s;ons who had a right to
$ote, take an oath pre&s;cribed to e&s;tabli&s;h his qualifications.
This re&s;traint was by no means effectual. So many o$ths
of different kinds had been pre&s;cribed &s;ince the Revolution,
<PB N="154" REF="159">
that they began to lo&s;e the effect they were intended to
have on the minds of men; and, in particular, political
pe$jury grew &s;o common, that it was no longer con&s;idered
as a crime. Subterfuges were di&s;covered, by means of
which this law relating to the qualification of candidates
was effectually eluded. Tho&s;e who were not actually
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch e&s;tates procured temporary conveyances
from their friends and patrons, on condition of their being
re&s;tored and cancelled after the election. By this &s;can|dalous
fraud, the intention of the legi&s;lature was fru&s;trated,
the dignity of parliament pro&s;tituted, the example of per|jury
and corruption extended, and the vengeance of heaven
&s;et at defiance. Through this infamous channel the mi|ni&s;try
had it in their power to thru&s;t into parliament a &s;$
of venal beggars, who, as they depended upon their boun|ty,
would always be ob&s;equious to their will, and vo$
according to direction, without the lea&s;t regard to the
dictates of their con&s;cience, or to the advantage of their
country. The mi&s;chiefs attending &s;uch a vile collu&s;ion
and in particular the undue influence which the crow$
mu&s;t have acquired from the practice, were either felt o$
apprehended by &s;ome hone&s;t patriots, who after divers u$
&s;ucce&s;sful efforts, at length pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e a bill
importing that every per&s;on who &s;hall be elected a member
of the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould, before he pre&s;umed $word$
take his &s;eat, deliver to the clerk of the Hou&s;e, at the tabl$
while the Commons are &s;itting, and the Speaker in th$
chair, a paper or &s;chedule &s;igned by him&s;elf, containing$
rental or particular of the lands, tenements, or heredit$
ments whereby he makes out his qualification, &s;pecifyi$
the nature of his e&s;tate, whether me&s;&s;uage, land ren$
tithe, or what el&s;e; and if &s;uch e&s;tate con&s;i&s;ts of me
&s;uages, lands, or tithes, then &s;pecifying in who&s;e occu|pation
they are; and if in rent, then &s;pecifying the nam$
of the owners or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the lands and tenements o$
of which &s;uch rent is i&s;&s;uing, and al&s;o &s;pecifying the pari$$
town&s;hip, or precinct and county, in which the &s;a$
e&s;tate lies, and the value thereof; and every &s;uch per&s;$$
<PB N="155" REF="160">
&s;hall, at the &s;ame time, al&s;o take and &s;ub&s;cribe the follow|ing
oath, to be fairly written at the bottom of the paper or
&s;chedule: &startq;I A. B. do &s;wear that the above is a true
rental: and that I truely, and <HI>bon&acirc; &s;ide,</HI> have &s;uch an
e&s;tate in law or equity, to and for my own u&s;e and bene|fit,
of and in the lands, tenements, or hereditaments
above de&s;cribed, over and above what will &s;atisfy and
clear all incumbrances that may affect the &s;ame; and
that &s;uch e&s;tate hath not been granted or made over to
me fraudulently, on purpo&s;e to qualify me to be a mem|ber
of this Hou&s;e. So help me God!&endq; It was provided
that the &s;aid paper or &s;chedule, with the oath afore&s;aid,
&s;hould be carefully kept by the clerk, to be in&s;pected by
the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, without fee or
reward: that if any per&s;on elected to &s;erve in any future
parliament &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;it or vote as a member of
the Hou&s;e of Commons before he had delivered in &s;uch a
paper or &s;chedule, and taken the oath afore&s;aid, or &s;hould
not be qualified according to the true intent or meaning of
this act, his election &s;hould be void; and every per&s;on &s;o
&s;itting and voting &s;hould forfeit a certain &s;um, to be re|covered
by &s;uch per&s;on as &s;hould &s;ue for the &s;ame by action
of debt, bill, plaint, or information, whereon no e&s;&s;oign,
privilege, protection, or wager of law &s;hould be allowed,
and only one imparlanch: that if any per&s;on &s;hould have
delivered in, and &s;worn to, his qualification as afore&s;aid,
and taken his &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, yet at any
time after &s;hould, during the continuance of &s;uch par|liament,
&s;ell, di&s;po&s;e of, alien, or any otherwi&s;e incumber
the e&s;tate, or any part there of compri&s;ed in the &s;chedule,
&s;o as to le&s;&s;en or reduce the &s;ame under the value of the
qualification by law directed; every &s;uch per&s;on, under a
certain penalty, mu&s;t deliver in a new, or further qua|lification,
according to the true intent and meaning of
this act, and &s;wear to the &s;ame, in manner before directed,
before he &s;hall again pre&s;ume to &s;it or vote as a member of
the Hou&s;e of Commons; that in ca&s;e any action, &s;uit, or
information &s;hould be brought, in pur&s;uance of this act,
<PB N="156" REF="161">
again&s;t any member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, the clerk
of the Hou&s;e &s;hall, upon demand, forthwith deliver a true
and atte&s;ted copy of the paper or &s;chedule &s;o delivered in to
him as afore&s;aid by &s;uch member to the plaintiff or pro&s;e|cutor,
or his attorney or agent, paying a certain &s;um for
the &s;ame; which being proved a true copy, &s;hall be ad|mitted
to be given in evidence upon the trial of any i&s;&s;ue
in any &s;uch action. Provided always, that nothing con|tained
in this act &s;hall extend to the elde&s;t &s;on or heir ap|parent
of any peer or lord of parliament, or of any per&s;on
qualified to &s;erve as knight of the &s;hire, or to the members
for either of the univer&s;ities in that part of Great Britain
called England, or to the members for that part of Great-Britain
called Scotland. Such was the &s;ub&s;tance of the
bill, as originally pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Commons;
but it was altered in &s;uch a manner, as, we are afraid,
will fail in an&s;wering the &s;alutary purpo&s;es for which it
was intended by tho&s;e who brought it into the Hou&s;e.
Notwith&s;tanding the provi&s;ions made in the act as it now
&s;tands, any mini&s;ter or patron may &s;till introduce his pen|&s;ioners,
clerks, and creatures into the Hou&s;e, by means of
the old method of temporary conveyance, though the farce$
mu&s;t now be kept up until the member &s;hall have delivered
in his &s;chedule, taken his oath, and his &s;eat in parliament;
then he may deliver up the conveyance, or execute a re|conveyance,
without running any ri&s;k of lo&s;ing his &s;eat,
or of being puni&s;hed for his fraud and perjury. The ex|ten&s;ive
influence of the crown, the general corruptibility of
individuals, and the ob&s;tacles &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly thrown in
the way of every &s;cheme contrived to vindicate the inde|pendency
of parliaments, mu&s;t have produced very mor|tifying
reflexions in the brea&s;t of every Briton w$$med
with the genuine love of his country. He mu&s;t ha$ $ per|ceived
that all the bulwarks of the con&s;titution were little
better than buttre&s;&s;es of ice, which would infallibly thaw
before the heat of mini&s;terial influence, when artfully con|centrated;
that either a mini&s;ter's profe&s;&s;ions of patrioti&s;m
were in&s;incere, or his credit in&s;ufficient to effect any
<PB N="157" REF="162">
e&s;&s;ential alteration in the unpopular mea&s;ures of govern|ment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1759.</NOTE>
and that, after all, the liberties of the nation could
never be &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as by the power, genero&s;ity,
and virtue of a patriot King. This inference could not
fail to awake the remembrance of that amiable prince,
whom fate untimely &s;natched from the eager hopes and
warm affection of a whole nation, before he had it in his
power to manife&s;t and e&s;tabli&s;h his favourite maxim,
That a monarch's glory was in&s;eparably connected with

Upon the&s;e con|$itions, and the&s;e conditions only, his Royal Highne&s;s thinks he has a right not to doubt of having a mo&s;t $word$ &s;upport from all tho&s;e good men who mean their country and this con&s;titution well, and that they will become $word$ and his family's friends, and unite with him to promote the good govern|ment of this country; and that they will follow him, upon the&s;e principles$ both in court, and out of court, and if he &s;hould live to form an ad$$$|&s;tration, it &s;hould be compo&s;ed without di&s;tinction of men of dig$$$ knowledge, and probity. His Royal Highne&s;s further promi&s;es to accept of no more, if offered to him, than 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> for his civil-li&s;t, by way $word$ rent-charge. <HI>An&s;wer to the foregoing propo&s;al.</HI> THE lords and gentlemen to whom a paper has been communicated, con|$aining his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince's gracious intentions upon &s;everal weighty and important points, of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the honour and intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's government, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the re|&s;toring and perpetuating the true u&s;e and de&s;ign of parliament, the pu$$$ of our excellent con&s;titution, and the happine&s;s and welfare of the wh$$ nation, do therein with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction ob&s;erve, and mo&s;t gratefu$$$ acknowledge, the up$ightne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his Royal Highne&s;s's noble &s;entiments and re&s;olutions.

&sect; LVII. On the fir&s;t day of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> a motion was
made, and leave given, to bring in a bill for enabling his
Maje&s;ty to make lea&s;es and copies of offices, lands, and
hereditaments, parcel of his duchy of Cornwall, or an|nexed
to the &s;ame; accordingly, it pa&s;&s;ed through both
Hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition, and enacted, that all lea&s;es and
grants made, or to be made, by his Maje&s;ty, within &s;even
years next en&s;uing, in, or annexed to, the &s;aid duchy,
under the limitations therein mentioned, &s;hould be good
and effectual in law again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, his heirs, and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and again&s;t all other per&s;ons that &s;hould here|after
inherit the &s;aid duchy, either by act of parliament,
or any limitation what&s;oever. This act appears the more
extraordinary, as the Prince of Wales, who has a &s;ort of
right by pre&s;cription to the duchy of Cornwall, was then
<PB N="159" REF="164">
of age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XII. 1760.</NOTE> and might have been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by the
$a&s;&s;ing of a patent. The Hou&s;e having peru&s;ed an ac|count
of the produce of the fund e&s;tabli&s;hed for paying
annuities granted in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty-nine, with the charge on that fund on the fifth
day of January, in the &s;ucceeding year, it appeared that
there had been a con&s;iderable deficiency in the &s;aid fund on
the fifth day of July preceding, and this had been made
good out of the &s;inking fund, by a re&s;olution of the &s;eventh
of February, already particulari&s;ed. They, therefore,
in&s;tructed the committee of ways and means to con&s;ider
$o much of the annuity and lottery act pa&s;&s;ed in the pre|$eding
&s;e&s;&s;ion as related to the three per centum annuities,
amounting to the &s;um of &s;even millions five hundred and
ninety thou&s;and pounds, granted in the year one thou&s;and
$even hundred and fifty-nine; and al&s;o to con&s;ider &s;o
much of the &s;aid act as related to the &s;ub&s;idy of poundage
upon certain goods and merchandi&s;es to be imported into
this kingdom, and the additional inland duty on coffee and
chocolate. The committee having taken the&s;e points into
deliberation, agreed to the two re&s;olutions we have already
mentioned with re&s;pect to the con&s;olidation, and a bill
was brought in for adding tho&s;e annuities granted in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine to the
$$int &s;tock of three per centum annuities con&s;olidated by
the acts of the twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth,
and thirty-&s;econd years of his Maje&s;ty's reign; and for
$everal duties therein mentioned, to the &s;inking-fund.
$he committee was afterwards empowered to receive a
$au&s;e for cancelling &s;uch lottery tickets as were made
$orth in pur&s;uance of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the thirtieth year
of his Maje&s;ty's reign, and were not then di&s;po&s;ed of: a
$au&s;e for this purpo&s;e was accordingly added to the bill,
which pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition,
$nd received the royal a&s;&s;ent at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; LVIII. On the twenty-ninth day of April, Lord
$orth pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e a bill for encouraging the
$xportation of rum and &s;pirits of the growth, produce,
<PB N="160" REF="165">
and manufacture of the Briti&s;h &s;ugar plantations from
Great-Britain, and of Briti&s;h &s;pirits made from mela&s;&s;es;
a bill which in a little time acquired the &s;anction of the$
royal a&s;&s;ent. Towards the end of April, Admiral Town$
&s;hend pre&s;ented a bill for the more effectual &s;ecuring the
payment of &s;uch prize and bounty monies as were appro|priated
to the u&s;e of Greenwich-ho&s;pital by an act pa&s;&s;e$
in the twenty-ninth year of his Maje&s;ty's reign. As $
that law no time was limited, or particular method pre$|&s;cribed
for giving notifications of the day appointed fo$
the payment of the &s;hares of the prizes and bounty money$
and many agents had neglected to &s;pecify in the notificatio$
given in the London Gazettee for payment, of &s;hares $word$
prizes condemned in the courts of Admiralty in Great
Britain the particular day or time when &s;uch payment
were to commence, whereby it was rendered difficult
if not impo&s;&s;ible, to a&s;certain the time when the ho&s;pit$$
at Greenwich became intituled to the unclaimed &s;hare,
of con&s;equence could not enjoy the full benefit of the act
the bill now prepared imported, that from and after th$
fir&s;t day of September, in the pre&s;ent year, all notifi|cations
of the payment of the &s;hares of prizes taken b$
any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, and condemned in
Great-Britain, and from and after the fir&s;t day of Febru|ary,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty
one, all notifications of the payment of the &s;hares an
prizes taken and condemned in any other of his Maje&s;ty
dominions in Europe, or in any of the Briti&s;h plantation
in America; and from and after the twenty-fifth day o$
December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred an$
&s;ixty-one, all notifications of the payment of the &s;hare
of prizes taken and condemned in any other of his Ma|je&s;ty's
dominions, &s;hall be re&s;pectively given and pub|li&s;hed
in the following manner: if the prize be condem$$
in any court of Admiralty in Great-Britain, &s;uch noti|fication,
under the agent's hand, &s;hall be publi&s;hed in th$
London Gazette; and if condemned in any court o$
admiralty in any other of his Maje&s;ty's dominions,&punc; &s;u$$
<PB N="161" REF="166">
notification &s;hall be publi&s;hed in like manner in the Ga|zette,
or other news-paper of publick authority, of the
i&s;land or place where the prize is condemned; and if
there &s;hall be no Gazette, or &s;uch news-paper, publi&s;hed
there, then in &s;ome or one of the publick news-papers of
the place; and &s;uch agents &s;hall deliver to the collector,
co&s;tomer, or &s;earcher, or his lawful deputy, and if there
&s;hall be no &s;uch officer, then to the principal officer or
officers of the place where the prize is condemned, or
to the lawful deputy of &s;uch principal officer, two of the
Gazettes or other news-papers in which &s;uch notifications
are in&s;erted; and if there &s;hall not be any publick news|papers
in any &s;uch i&s;land of place, the agent &s;hall give
two &s;uch notifications in writing, under his hand; and
every &s;uch collector, or other officer as afore&s;aid, &s;hall
&s;ub&s;cribe his name on both the &s;aid Gazettes, news|papers,
or written notifications, and, by the fir&s;t &s;hip
which &s;hall &s;ail from thence to any port of Great-Britain,
&s;hall tran&s;mit to the trea&s;urer or deputy trea&s;urers of the
&s;aid royal ho&s;pital one of the &s;aid notifications, with his
name &s;o &s;ub&s;cribed, to be there regi&s;tered, and &s;hall faith|fully
pre&s;erve and keep the other, with his name thereon
&s;ub&s;cribed, in his own cu&s;tody; and in every notification
as afore&s;aid the agent &s;hall &s;pecify his place of abode, and
the preci&s;e day of the month and year appointed for the
payment of the re&s;pective &s;hares to the captors; and all
notifications with re&s;pect to prizes condemned in Great-Britain
&s;hall be publi&s;hed in the London Gazette three
days at lea&s;t before any &s;hare of &s;uch prize &s;hall be paid;
and with re&s;pect to prizes condemned in any other part of
his Maje&s;ty's dominions, &s;uch notifications &s;hall be de|livered
to the &s;aid collector, or other officers as afore&s;aid,
three days at lea&s;t before any &s;hare of &s;uch prizes &s;hall be
paid. It was likewi&s;e enacted, that the agents for the
di&s;tribution of bounty-bills &s;hould in&s;ert, and publi&s;h
under their hands, in the London Gazette, three days at
lea&s;t before payment, publick notifications of the day and
year appointed for &s;uch payment, and al&s;o in&s;ert therein
<PB N="162" REF="167">
their re&s;pective places of abode. The bill, even as it $word$
now &s;tands, is liable to &s;everal objections. It may be
dangerous to leave the money of the unclaimed &s;hares &s;o
long as three years in the hands of the agent, who, toge|ther
with his &s;ecurities, may prove in&s;olvent before the
expiration of that term: then the time pre&s;cribed to the
&s;ailors within which their claim is limited appears to be
too &s;hort, when we con&s;ider that they may be &s;o circum|&s;tanced,
turned over to another &s;hip, and conveyed to a
di&s;tant part of the globe, that they &s;hall have no oppor|tunity
to claim payment; and &s;hould three years elap&s;e
before they could make application to the agent, they
would find their bounty or prize money appropriated to
the u&s;e of Greenwich-Ho&s;pital; nay, &s;hould they die in
the cour&s;e of the voyage, it would be lo&s;t to their heirs
and executors, who, being ignorant of their title, could
not po&s;&s;ibly claim within the time limited.</P>
<P>&sect; LIX. A committee having been appointed to enquire
into the original &s;tandards of weights and mea&s;ures in
the kingdom of England, to con&s;ider the laws relating
thereto, and to report their ob&s;ervations thereupon, to|gether
with their opinion of the mo&s;t effectual means for
a&s;certaining and enforcing uniform and certain &s;tandards
of weights and mea&s;ures, they prepared copies, models,
patterns, and multiples, and pre&s;ented them to the Hou&s;e&punc;
then they were locked up by the clerk of the Hou&s;e; and
Lord Carysfort pre&s;ented a bill, according to order,
for enforcing uniformity of weights and mea&s;ures to the
&s;tandards by law to be e&s;tabli&s;hed: but this mea&s;ure,
which had been &s;o long in dependence, was not yet fully
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the &s;tandards and weights were re&s;erved to
another occa&s;ion. A law was made for reviving and
continuing &s;o much of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fir&s;t
year of his Maje&s;ty's reign as relates to the more effectual
trial and puni&s;hment of high-trea&s;on in the highlands of
Scotland; and al&s;o for continuing two other acts pa&s;&s;ed
in the nineteenth and twenty-fir&s;t years of his Maje&s;ty's
reign, &s;o far as they relate to the more effectual di&s;arming
<PB N="163" REF="168">
the highlands of Scotland, and &s;ecuring the peace
thereof; and to allow further time for making affidavits
of the execution of articles or contracts of clerks to attor|nies
or &s;ollicitors, and filing thereof. The King having
been plea&s;ed to pardon George Keith, Earl Mari&s;chal of
Scotland, who had been attainted for rebellion in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen, the parlia|ment
confirmed this indulgence, by pa&s;&s;ing an act to en|able
the &s;aid George Keith, late Earl Mari&s;chal, to &s;ue
or entertain any action of &s;uit, notwith&s;tanding his at|tainder,
and to remove any di&s;ability in him, by rea&s;on
of the &s;aid attainder, to take or inherit any real or per&s;onal
e&s;tate that may and &s;hall hereafter de&s;cend or come to
him, or which he was entitled to in rever&s;ion or remainder
before his attainder. This nobleman, univer&s;ally re|&s;pected
for his probity and under&s;tanding, had been em|ployed
as amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France by the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia, and was actually at this juncture in the &s;ervice
of that monarch, who, in all probability, interceded
with the King of England in his behalf. When his
pardon had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eals, he repaired to London, and
was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, by whom he was very gra|ciou&s;ly
received.</P>
<P>&sect; LX. The&s;e and a good number of other bills of le&s;s
importance, both private and publick, were pa&s;&s;ed into
laws by commi&s;&s;ion, on the twenty-&s;econd day of May,
when the lord-keeper of the great &s;eal clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion
with a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es. He began with an a&s;&s;ur|ance
that his Maje&s;ty looked back on their proceedings
with entire &s;atisfaction. He &s;aid, the duty and affection
which they had expre&s;&s;ed for the King's per&s;on and go|vernment,
the zeal and unanimity they had &s;howed in
maintaining the true intere&s;t of their country, could only
be equalled by what his Maje&s;ty had formerly experienced
from this parliament. He told them it would have given
his Maje&s;ty the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, had he been able
to a&s;&s;ure them that his endeavours to promote $n general
peace had met with more &s;uitable returns. He ob&s;erved,
<PB N="164" REF="169">
that his Maje&s;ty, in conjunction with his good brother and
ally the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, had cho&s;en to give their enemies
proofs of this equitable di&s;po&s;ition, in the mid&s;t of the &s;eries
of glorious victories; an opportunity the mo&s;t proper to
take &s;uch a &s;tep with dignity, and to manife&s;t to all Eu|rope
the purity and moderation of his views. After &s;uch
a conduct, he &s;aid, the King had the comfort to reflect
that the further continuance of the calamities of war
could not be imputed to him or his allies; that he tru&s;ted
in the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven upon the ju&s;tice of his arms, and
upon tho&s;e ample means which the zeal of the parliament
in &s;o good a cau&s;e had wi&s;ely put into his hands, that his
future &s;ucce&s;&s;es in carrying on the war would not $all
&s;hort of the pa&s;t; and that, in the event, the publick
tranquillity would be re&s;tored on &s;olid and durable foun|dations.
He acquainted them that his Maje&s;ty had taken
the mo&s;t effectual care to augment the combined army in
Germany: and at the &s;ame time to keep up &s;uch a force
at home as might fru&s;trate any attempts of the enemy
to invade the&s;e kingdoms; &s;uch attemps as had hitherto
ended only in their own confu&s;ion. He took notice that
the royal navy was never in a more flouri&s;hing and re&s;pect|able
condition; and the &s;ignal victory obtained la&s;t winter
over the French fleet on their own coa&s;ts had given lu&s;tre
to his Maje&s;ty's arms, fre&s;h &s;pirits to his maritime forces,
and reduced the naval &s;trength of France to a very low
ebb. He gave them to under&s;tand that his Maje&s;ty had
di&s;po&s;ed his &s;qu$d$ons$ in &s;uch a manner as might be&s;t con|duce
to the annoyance of his enemies; to the defence of
his own dominions, both in Europe and America; to
the pre&s;erving and pur&s;uing his conque&s;ts, as well as to
the protection of the trade of his &s;ubjects, which he had
extremely at heart. He told the Commons, that nothing
could relieve his Maje&s;ty's royal mind, under the anxiety
he felt for the burthens of his faithful &s;ubjects, but the
publick-&s;pirited chearfulne&s;s with which their Hou&s;e had
granted him &s;uch large &s;upplies, and his conviction that
they were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity had e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts
<PB N="165" REF="170">
of his kingdom; he, therefore, returned them his hearty
thanks for the&s;e &s;upplies, and a&s;&s;ured them they &s;hould
be duely applied to the purpo&s;es for which they had been
given. Finally, he recommended to both Hou&s;es the
continuance of that union and good harmony which he
had ob&s;erved with &s;o much plea&s;ure, and from which he
had derived &s;uch important effects. He de&s;ired they
would &s;tudy to promote the&s;e de&s;ireable objects, to &s;up|port
the King's government, and the good order of their
re&s;pective counties, and con&s;ult their own real happine&s;s
and pro&s;perity.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the la&s;t campaign had &s;lu&s;hed<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII. 1760.</NOTE>
the whole nation with the mo&s;t elevated hope
of future conque&s;t, and the government was enabled to
take every &s;tep which appeared nece&s;&s;ary to reali&s;e that
&s;anguine expectation: but the war became every day more
and more Germani&s;ed. Not with&s;tanding the immen&s;e
&s;ums that were rai&s;ed for the expen&s;e of the current year;
notwith&s;tanding the great number of land forces main|tained
in the &s;ervice, and the numerours fle$ts that $illed the
<PB N="168" REF="173">
harbours of Great-Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> we do not find that one fre&s;h
effort was made to improve the advantages &s;he had gained
upon her own element; or for pu&s;hing the war on na|tional
principles: for the reduction of Canada was no more
than the con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures which had been
taken in the preceding campaign. But, before we record
the progre&s;s of the war, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify
&s;ome dome&s;tick occurrences, that for a little while engro&s;|&s;ed
the publick attention. In the month of December, in
the preceding year, William Andrew Horne, a gentle|man
of &s;ome fortune in Derby&s;hire, was executed at
Nottingham, in the &s;eventy-fourth year of his age, for
the murther of an in&s;ant born of his own &s;i&s;ter, in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-four. On
the third day after the birth, this brutal ruffian thru&s;t the
child into a linen bag, and, accompanied by his own
brother on hor&s;eback, conveyed it to Anne$ley, in Not|tingham&s;hire,
where it was next day found dead under a
hay-&s;tack. Though this cruel ru&s;tick knew how much
he lay at the mercy of his brother, whom he had made
privy to this affair, far from endeavouring to engage his
&s;ecre&s;y by offices of kindne&s;s and marks of affection, he
treated him as an alien to his blood; not barely with in|difference,
but even with the mo&s;t barbarous rigour. He
not only defrauded him of his right, but exacted of him
the lowe&s;t menial &s;ervices; beheld him &s;tarving in a cot|tage,
while he lived him&s;elf in affluence; and refu&s;ed to
relieve with a mor&s;el of charity the children of his own
brother begging at his gate. It was the re&s;entment of
this pride and bar barity which, in all likelihood, fir&s;t
impelled the other to revenge. He pretended qualms of
con&s;cience, and di&s;clo&s;ed the tran&s;action of the child to
&s;everal individuals. As the brother was univer&s;ally hated
for the in&s;olence and brutality of his di&s;po&s;ition, inform|ation
was given again&s;t him, and a re&s;olution formed to
bring him to condign puni&s;hment. Being informed of
this de&s;ign, he tampered with his brother, and de&s;ired
that he would retract, upon the trial, the evidence he
<PB N="169" REF="174">
$ad given before the ju&s;tice. Though the brother re|$ected
this &s;cheme of &s;ubordination, he offered to with|$raw
him&s;elf from the kingdom, if he might have five
$ounds to defray the expen&s;e of his removal. So &s;ordidly
$varitious was the other, that he refu&s;ed to advance this$
mi&s;erable pittance, though he knew his own life depended
upon his compliance. He was accordingly apprehended,
$ried, and convicted on his brother's evidence; and then
$he confe&s;&s;ed the particulars of his expo&s;ing the infant.
He denied, indeed, that he had any thought the child
would peri&s;h, and declared he intended it as a pre&s;ent
to the gentleman at who&s;e gate it was laid: but as he
appeared to be hardened mi&s;creant, devoid of humanity,
&s;tained with the complicated crimes of tyranny, fraud,
rapine, ince&s;t, and mu$ther, very little credit is due to
his declaration. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, part
of We&s;tmin&s;ter was grievo$&s;ly alarmed by a dreadful con|flagration,
which broke out$ $word$ the hou&s;e of a cabinet|maker
near Covent-Garden, raged with great fury, and
reduced near twenty hou&s;es to a&s;hes. Many others
were damaged, and &s;everal pre&s;ons either burned in their
apartments, or buried under the ruins. The bad con|quences
of this calamity were in a great mea&s;ure alleviated
by the humanity of the publick, and the generous com|pa&s;&s;ion
of the Prince of Wales, who contributed liberally
to the relief of the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>&sect; II. But no &s;ubject &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed the conver&s;ation
and pa&s;&s;ions of the publick as did the ca&s;e of Lord George
Sackville, who had by this time re&s;igned his command
in Germany, and returned to England, the country
which, of all others, it would have been his intere&s;t to
$void at this juncture, if he was really con&s;cions of the
guilt, the imputation of which his character now &s;u&s;tained.
With the fir&s;t tidings of the battle &s;ought at Minden
the de$amation of this officer arrived. He was accu&s;ed of
having di&s;obeyed orders, and his conduct repre&s;ented as
$nfamous in every particular. The&s;e were the &s;ugge&s;tions
of a vague report, which no per&s;on could trace to its
<PB N="170" REF="175">
origin; yet this report immediately gave birth to one of$
the mo&s;t inflammatory pamphlets that ever was exhibited
to the publick. The fir&s;t charge had alarmed the people$
of England, jealous in honour, &s;udden and ra&s;h in their$
re&s;entments, and ob&s;tinately adhering to the prejudices,
they have e&s;pou&s;ed. The implied accu&s;ation in the orders,
of Prince Ferdinand, and the combu&s;tible matter &s;uper-added
by the pamphlet-writer, kindled up &s;uch a blaze
of indignation in the minds of the people, as admitted of
no temperament or controul. An abhorrence and de|te&s;tation
of Lord George Sackville, as a coward and a$
traitor, became the univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, which acted by con|tagion,
infecting all degrees of people from the cottage to,
the throne; and no individual, who had the lea&s;t regard$
for his own character and quiet, would venture to preac$
up moderation, or even advi&s;e a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of belief unti$
more certain information could be received. Fre&s;h fue$
was continually thrown in by ob&s;cure authors of pam|phlets
and news-papers, who &s;tigmati&s;ed and in&s;ulted with$
&s;uch virulent per&s;everance, that one would have imagine$
they were actuated by per&s;onal motives, not retained b$
mercenary book&s;ellers, again&s;t that unfortunate nobleman$
Not &s;atisfied with inventing circum&s;tances to his di&s;ho|nour,
in his conduct on the la&s;t occa&s;ion, they pretende$
to take a retro&s;pective view of his character, and produce$
a number of anecdotes to his prejudice, which had never$
before &s;een the light, and but for this occa&s;ion had pro|bably
never been known. Not that all the writings which$
appeared on this &s;ubject contained fre&s;h matter of aggra|vation
again&s;t Lord George Sackville. Some writers
either animated by the hope of advantage, or hired t$
b$tray the cau&s;e which they undertook to defend, entered$
the li&s;t as profe&s;&s;ed champions of the accu&s;ed, a&s;&s;ume$
the pen in his behalf, devoid of &s;en&s;e, unfurni&s;hed wi$h
materials, and produced performances which could no$
$ail to injure his character among all tho&s;e who believe$
that he countenanced their endeavours, and &s;upplied the$
with the facts and arguments of his defence. Such pre$
<PB N="171" REF="176">
$ely was the &s;tate of the di&s;pute when Lord George
$$rived in London. While Prince Ferdinand was
$owned with laurel: while the King of Great-Britain
$pproved his conduct, and as the mo&s;t glorious mark of
$$at approbation, inve&s;ted him with the order of the
$arter; while his name was celebrated through all Eng|$$nd,
and extolled, in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of hyper|$le,
above all the heroes of antiquity; every mouth
$as opened in execration of the late commander of the
$riti&s;h troops in Germany. He was now made acquaint|$d
with the particulars of his imputed guilt, which he
$ad before indi&s;tinctly learned. He was accu&s;ed of having
$i&s;obeyed three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive orders he had received from the
$eneral, during the action at Minden, to advance with
$$e cavalry of the right wing, which he commanded,
$nd &s;u&s;tain the infantry that were engaged; and after
$he cavalry were put in motion, of having halted them
$nnece&s;&s;arily, and marched &s;o &s;low, that they could not
$each the place of action in time to be of any &s;ervice;
$y which conduct the opportunity was lo&s;t of attacking
$he enemy when they gave way, and rendering the victory
$ore glorious and deci&s;ive. The fir&s;t &s;tep which Lord
George took towards his own vindication with the publick,
$as in printing a &s;hort addre&s;s, entreating them to &s;u&s;pend
$heir belief with re&s;pect to his character until the charge
$rought again&s;t him &s;hould be legally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by a court|$artial;
a trial which he had already &s;ollicited, and was
$n hopes of obtaining.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Finding him&s;elf unable to &s;tem the tide of popu|$ar
prejudice, which flowed again&s;t him with irre&s;i&s;tible
$mpe$uo&s;ity, he might have retired in quiet and &s;afety,
$nd left it to ebb at lei&s;ure. This would have been ge|$erally
deemed a prudential &s;tep, by all tho&s;e who con|&s;idered
the unfavourable medium through which every
$articular of his conduct mu&s;t have been viewed at that
$uncture, even by men who cheri&s;hed the mo&s;t candid
$ntentions; when they reflected upon the power, influ|$nce,
and popularity of his accu&s;er; the danger of aggra|vating
<PB N="172" REF="177">
the re&s;entment of the &s;overeign, already too con|&s;picuous,
and the ri&s;k of hazarding his life on the honour
and integrity of witne&s;&s;es, who might think their fortunes
depended upon the nature of the evidence they &s;hould give.
Notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions Lord George, &s;eeming|ly
impatient of the imputation under which his character
laboured, in&s;i&s;ted upon the privilege of a legal trial, which
was granted accordingly, after the judges had given it as
their opinion that he might be tried by a court-martial,
though he no longer retained any commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;er|vice.
A court of general officers being appointed and
a&s;&s;embled to enquire into his conduct, the judge-advocate
gave them to under&s;tand that he was charged with having
di&s;obeyed the orders of Prince Ferdinand, relative to the
battle of Minden. That the reader may have the more
di&s;tinct idea of the charge, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remind him
that Lord George Sackville commanded the cavalry of
the right wing, confi&s;ting of Hanoverian and Briti&s;h hor&s;e,
di&s;po&s;ed in two lines, the Briti&s;h being at the extremity of
the right, extending to the village of Hartum; the Hano|verian
cavalry forming the left, that reached almo&s;t to an
open wood or grove, which divided the hor&s;e from the
line of infantry, particularly from that part of the line of
infantry con&s;i&s;ting of two brigades of Briti&s;h foot, the
Hanov$rian guards, and Hardenberg's regiment. This
was the body of troops which &s;u&s;tained the brunt of the
battle with the mo&s;t incredible courage and per&s;everance.
They of their own accord advanced to attack the left of
the enemy's cavalry, through a mo&s;t dreadful fi$e of ar|tillery
and &s;mall arms, to which they were expo&s;ed in front
and flank; they with&s;tood the repeated attacks of the
whole French gendarmerie, whom, at length, they totally
routed, together with a body of Saxon troops on their
left, and to their valour the victory was chiefly owing.
The ground from which the&s;e troops advanced was a kind
of heath or plain, which opened a con&s;iderable way to the
left, where the re&s;t of the army was formed in order of
battle; but on the right it was bounded by the wood,
<PB N="173" REF="178">
on the other &s;ide of which the cavalry of the right wing
was po&s;ted, having in front the village of Halen, from
whence the French had been driven by the piquets in the
army there po&s;ted, and in front of them a windmill, &s;itu|ated
in the middle &s;pace between them and a battery
placed on the left of the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect;IV. Early in the morning Captain Malhorti had, by order
of Prince Ferdinand, po&s;ted the cavalry of the right wing
in the &s;ituation we have ju&s;$ de&s;cribed, the village of Har|$um
with enclo&s;ures on the right, a narrow wood on the
left, the village of Halen in their front, and a windmill in
the middle of an open plain, which led directly to the
enemy. In this po&s;ition Lord George Sackville was di|rected
to remain, until he &s;hould receive further orders;
and here it was tho&s;e orders were given which he was &s;aid
to have di&s;obeyed. Indeed, he was previou&s;ly charged
with having neglected the orders of the preceding even|ing,
which imported that the hor&s;es &s;hould be &s;addled
at one in the morning, though the tents were not to be
&s;truck, nor the troops under arms, until they &s;hould receive
further orders. He was accu&s;ed of having di&s;obeyed the&s;e
orders, and of having come late into the field, after the
cavalry was formed. Captain Winchingrode, aide-du-camp
to Prince Ferdinand, declared upon oath, that while
the infantry of the right wing were advancing towards
the enemy for the &s;econd time, he was &s;ent with orders to
Lord George Sackville to advance with the cavalry of the
right wing, and &s;u&s;tain the infantry, which was going to
engage, by forming the hor&s;e under his command, upon
the heath, in a third line behind the regiments; that he
delivered the&s;e orders to Lord George Sackville, giving
him to under&s;tand that he &s;hould march the cavalry
through the wood or trees on his left to the heath where
they were to be formed; that, on his return to the heath,
he met Colonel Fitzroy riding at full gallop towards Lord
George; and that he (Winchingrode) followed him back,
in order to ha&s;ten the march of the cavalry. Colonel
Ligonier, another of the Prince's aides-du-camps, depo&s;ed
<PB N="174" REF="179">
that he carried orders from the general to Lord George $word$
advance with the cavalry, in order to profit from the di&s;$|order
which appeared in the enemy's cavalry; that Lor$
George made no an&s;wer to the&s;e orders, but turning t$
the troops, commanded them to draw their &s;words, an$
march; that the Colonel &s;eeing them advance a few pac$$
on the right forwards, told his lord&s;hip he mu&s;t march $
the left; that in the mean time Colonel Fitzroy arrivi$
with orders for the Briti&s;h cavalry only to advance, Lor$
George &s;aid the orders were contradictory, and Colon$
Ligonier replied, they differed only in numbers, but th$
de&s;tination of his march was the &s;ame, to the left. Colon$
Fitzroy, the third aide-du-camp to Prince Ferdinan$
gave evidence, that when he told Lord George it was t$$
Prince's order for the Briti&s;h cavalry to advance towar$
t$$ left, his lord&s;hip ob&s;erved that it was different from the
order brought by Colonel Ligonier, and he could n$
think the Prince intended to break the line; that he a&s;ke$
which way the cavalry was to march, and who was to $
their guide; that when he (the aide-du-camp) offered $
lead the column through the wood on the left, his lord&s;hi$
&s;eemed &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied with the order, &s;aying it did n$
agree with the order brought by Colonel Ligonier, and d$
fired to be conducted in per&s;on to the Prince, that he migh$
have an explanation from his own mouth; a re&s;olutio$
which was immediately executed. The next evidence
an officer of rank in the army, made oath that, in $
opinion, when the orders were delivered to Lord George
his lord&s;hip was alarmed to a very great degree, an
&s;eemed to be in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. A certain noble$
man, of high rank, and unblemi&s;ned reputation, declare$
that Captain Winchingrode having told $word$ it was ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary that the cavalry &s;hould march, and form
$line to &s;upport the foot, he had given orders to the &s;econ
line to march; that as &s;oon as they arrived at the $lac$
where the action began, he was met $span$
with an order for the cavalry to advance as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible
that in marching to this place, an order came to halt, unt$$
<PB N="175" REF="180">
they could be joined by the fir&s;t line of cavalry that
afterwards, in advancing, they were again halted by Lord
George Sackville; that, in his opinion, they might have
marched with more expedition, and even come up time
$nough to act again&s;t the enemy: &s;ome other officers who
were examined on this &s;ubject agreed with the Marquis
in the&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Lord George, in his defence, proved, by unde|$iable
evidence, that he never received the orders i&s;&s;ued on
the eve of the battle, nor any &s;ort of intimation or plan of
action, although he was certainly entitled to &s;ome &s;uch
$ommunication, as commander in chief of the Briti&s;h
forces: that, neverthele&s;s, the orders concerning the hor&s;es
were obeyed by tho&s;e who received them; that Lord George
$n&s;tead of loitering or lo&s;ing time while the troops
were forming, prepared to put him&s;elf at the head of the
cavalry on the fir&s;t notice that they were in motion: that
he was &s;o eager to perform his duty, as to &s;et out from his
quarters without even waiting for an aide-du-camp to
$ttend him, and was in the field before any general officer
of his divi&s;ion. He declared, that when Captain Winch|$ngrode
delivered the order to form the cavalry in one line,
making a third, to advance and &s;u&s;tain the infantry, he
$either heard him &s;ay he was to march by the left, nor&s;aw
$im point with his &s;word to the wood through which he
was to pa&s;s. Neither of the&s;e directions were ob&s;erved by
$ny of the aides-du-camp or officers then pre&s;ent, except
$ne gentleman, the per&s;on who bore witne&s;s to the con|$u&s;ion
in the looks and deportment of his lord&s;hip. It
was proved that the neare&s;t and mo&s;t practicable way of
$dvancing again&s;t the enemy was by the way of the wind|$ill,
to the left of the village of Halen. It appeared that
Lord George imagined this was the only way by which
$e &s;hould be ordered to advance; that, in this per&s;ua&s;ion,
$e had &s;ent an officer to reconnoitre the village of Halen,
$s an object of importance, as it would have been upon
$he flank of the cavalry in advancing forwards; that when
$e received the order from Winchingrode to form the line,
<PB N="176" REF="181">
and advance, he &s;till imagined this was his route, and, o$
this &s;uppo&s;ition, immediately detached an aide-du-cam$
to remove a regiment of Saxe-Gotha, which was in th$
front; that he &s;ent a &s;econd to ob&s;erve the place whe$
the infantry were, and a third to reconnoitre the enemy$
and in a few minutes Colonel Ligonier coming up wit$
an order from Prince Ferdinand to advance the cavalry$
his lord&s;hip immediately drew his &s;word, and ordered then$
to march forward by the windmill. The colonel de+clared
that when he delivered the order, he added &startq;by th$
left;&endq; but Lord George affirmed that he heard no $u$$
direction, nor didit reach the ears of any other per&s;on the
pre&s;ent, except of that officer who witne&s;&s;ed to the &s;am$
direction given by Winchingrode. It was proved tha$
immediately after the troops were put in motion, Colon$
Fitzroy arrived with an order from Prince Ferdinaud, im+porting,
that the Briti&s;h cavalry only &s;hould advance b$
the left; that Lord George declared their orders wer$
contradictory, and &s;eemed the more puzzled, as he under+&s;tood
that both the&s;e gentlemen came off nearly at th$
&s;ame time from the Prince, and were probably directed t$
communicate the &s;ame order. It was, therefore, natura$
to &s;uppo&s;e there was a mi&s;take, as there might be danger $
breaking the line, as the route by the wood appeared mor$
difficult and tedious than that by the windmill, which le$
directly through open ground to the enemy, and as h$
could not think that if a body of hor&s;e was immediatel$
wanted, the general would &s;end for the Briti&s;h, that wer$
at the farthe&s;t extremity of the wing, rather than for th$
Hanoverian cavalry, who formed the left of the line, an$
con&s;equently were much nearer the &s;eene of action. $
was proved that Lord George, in this uncertainty, r$+&s;olved
to apply for an explanation to the Prince in per&s;on
who he under&s;tood was at a &s;mall di&s;tance; that with th$
view, he &s;et out with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; that having
entered the wood, and perceived that the country beyon$
it opened &s;ooner to the left than he had imagined, an$
Captain Smith, his aide-du-camp, advi&s;ing that the Briti&s;$
<PB N="177" REF="182">
cavalry &s;hould be put in motion, he &s;ent back that gentle|man,
with orders for them to advance by the left with all
po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch; that he rode up to the general, who
received him without any marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, and or|dered
him to bring up the whole cavalry of the right wing
in a line upon the heath; an order, as the reader will
perceive, quite different from that which was &s;o warmly
e&s;pou&s;ed by the aide-du-camp; that as the Marquis of
Granby had already put the &s;econd line in motion, ac|cording
to a &s;eparate order which he had received, and the
head of his column was already in view, coming out of the
wood, Lord George thought it nece&s;&s;ary to halt the troops
on the left, until the right &s;hould come into the line, and
afterwards &s;end them orders to march flower, that two
regiments, which had been thrown out of the line, might
have an opportunity to replace them&s;elves in their proper
&s;tations.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. With re&s;pect to the confu&s;ion which one officer
affirmed was perceivable in the countenance and deport|ment
of this commander, a con&s;iderable number of other
officers then pre&s;ent, being interrog$ted by his lord&s;hip,
$unanimou&s;ly declared that they &s;aw no &s;uch marks of con|fu&s;ion,
but that he delivered his orders with all the marks
of c$olne&s;s and deliberation. The candid reader will of
him&s;elf determine, whether a man's heart is to be judged
by any change of his complexion, granting &s;uch a change
to have happened; whether the evidence of one witne&s;s,
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, will weigh again&s;t the concurrent te&s;timony
of all the officers w$o$e immediate bu&s;ine&s;s it was to attend
and ob&s;erve the commander: whether it was likely that
an officer, who had been more than once in actual &s;ervice,
and behaved without reproach, &s;o as to attain &s;uch an
$word$ rank in the army, &s;hould exhibit &s;ymptoms of $
fear and confu&s;ion, when there was in reality no appear|an$$
of danger; for none of the orders imported that he
&s;hould attack the enemy, but only advance to &s;u&s;tain the
$nfantry. The time which elap&s;ed from the fir&s;t order he
$received by Captain Winchingrode, to the arrival of Col-Ligonier,
<PB N="178" REF="183">
did not exceed eight minutes, during which
his aide-du-camp, Captain Hugo, was employed in re|moving
the Saxe Gotha regiment from the front, by which
he propo&s;ed to advance. From that period till the cavalry
actually marched, in con&s;equence of an order from Lord
George, the length of time was differently e&s;timated $
the opinions of different witne&s;&s;es, but, at a medium, co$|puted
by the judge advocate at fifteen minutes, during
which the following circum&s;tances were tran&s;acted $word$
troops werefir&s;t ordered to advance forwards, then $word$
the contradictory orders arrived and were di&s;puted; th$
commander de&s;ired the two aides-du-camp to agree $word$
which was the preci&s;e order, and he would obey it imm$|diately;
each in&s;i&s;ting upon that which he had delivere$
Lord George ha&s;tened to the general for an explanation
and, as he pa&s;&s;ed the wood, &s;ent back Captain Smith $
the right of the cavalry, which was at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, to put the Briti&s;h hor&s;e in motion. We &s;hal$
not pretend to determine whether the commander of &s;uch
an important body may be excu&s;eable for he&s;itating, when
he receives contradictory orders at the &s;ame time, e&s;pecially
when both orders run counter to his own judgment; whe|ther
in that ca&s;e it is allowable for him to &s;u&s;pend the
operation for a few minutes, in order to con&s;ult in per&s;on
the commander in chief about a &s;tep of &s;uch con&s;equence
to the pre&s;ervation of the whole army. Neither will we
venture to decide dogmatically on the merits of the march,
after the cavalry were put in motion; whether they
marched too &s;low, or were unnece&s;&s;arily halted, in their
way to the heath. It was proved, indeed, that Lord
George was always remarkably &s;low in his movements of
cavalry, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that if hor&s;es are blown they
mu&s;t be un&s;it for &s;ervice, and that the lea&s;t hurry is ap$ $o
di&s;order the line of hor&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as would rob
them of their proper effect, and render all their efforts
abortive. This being the &s;y&s;tem of Lord George Sack|ville,
it may de&s;eive con&s;ideration, whether he could de|viate
from it on this delicate occa&s;ion, without renonncing
<PB N="179" REF="184">
the dictates of his ownjudgment and di&s;cretion; and whe|ther
he was at liberty to u&s;e his own judgment, after hav|ing
received the order to advance. After all, whether he
was intentionally guilty, and what were the motives by
which he was really actuated, are que&s;tions which his
own con&s;cieuce alone can &s;olve. Even granting him to
have he&s;itated from perplexity, to have lingered from vex|ation,
to have tailed through error of judgment, he will
probably find favour with the candid and humane part of
his fellow-&s;u$jects, when they reflect upon the nature of
his &s;ituation, placed at the head of &s;uch a body of cavalry,
unit$truct$d and uninformed of plan or circum&s;tance,
divided from the re&s;t of the army, unacquainted with the
op$$ations of the day, chagrined with doubt and di&s;appoint|ment,
and perplexed by contradictory orders&punc; neither of
which he could execute without offering violence to his
own judgment; when they con&s;ider the endeavours he u&s;ed
to mamfe&s;t his obedience; the la&s;t di&s;tinct order which he
in per&s;on received and executed; that mankind are liable
to mi&s;takes; that the cavalry were not originally intended
to act, as appears in the account of the battle, publi&s;hed
at the H$gue, by the authority of Prince Ferdinand, ex|pre&s;sly
declaring that the cav$lry on the right did not act,
becau&s;e it was de&s;tined to &s;u&s;tain the infantry in a third
$ne; that if it had really been de&s;igned for action it ought
either to have been po&s;ted in another place, or permitted
to advance &s;traight forwards by the windmill, according to
the idea of its commander; &s;iually, when they recall to
view the general confu&s;ion that &s;eems to have prevailed
through the manoeuv$es of that morning, and remember
&s;ome particulars of th$ action; that the brigades of Briti&s;h
artillery had no orders until they applied to Lord George
Sackville, who directed them to the &s;pot where they ac|quitted
them&s;elves with &s;o much honour and eff$ct, in
contributing to the &s;ucce&s;s of the day; that the glory and
advantage acquired by the few br$gades of infantry, who
may be &s;aid to have defeated the whole French army, was
in no re&s;pect owing to any general or particular $word$ or
<PB N="180" REF="185">
in&s;tructions, bnt entirely flowing from the native valour of
the troops, and the &s;pirited conduct of their immediate
commanders; and that a great number of officers in the
allied army, even of tho&s;e who remained on the open heath,
never &s;aw the face of the enemy, or &s;aw them at &s;uch a
di&s;tance, that they could not di&s;tingui&s;h more than the hats
and the arms of the Briti&s;h regiments with which they
were engaged. With re&s;pect to the imputation of cow|ardice
levelled at Lord George by the unthinking mul|titude,
and circulated with &s;uch indu&s;try and clamour, we
ought to con&s;ider it as a mob-accu&s;ation, which the brave&s;t
of men, even the great Duke of Marlborough, could not
e&s;cape; we ought to receive it as a dangerous &s;u&s;picion,
which &s;trikes at the root of character, and may bla&s;t that
honour in a moment which the &s;oldier has acquired in a
long cour&s;e of painful &s;ervice, at the continual hazard of
his life; we ought to di&s;tru&s;t it as a malignant charge,
altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the former conduct of the per|&s;on
accu&s;ed, as well as with his &s;ub&s;equent impatience
and per&s;everance in demanding a trial, to which he never
would have been called; a trial which, though his life
was at &s;take, and his cau&s;e out of countenance, he &s;u&s;tained
with &s;uch courage, fortitude, and pre&s;ence of mind, as
even his enemies them&s;elves could not help admiring.
Thus have we given a &s;uccinct detail of this remark|able
affair, with that &s;pirit of impartiality, that &s;acred
regard to truth which the importance of hi&s;tory demands.
To the be&s;t of our recollection we have forgot no e&s;&s;ential
article of the accu&s;ation, nor &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any material cir|cum&s;tance
urged in defence of Lord George Sackville.
Unknown to his per&s;on, unconnected with his friends, un|moved
by fear, unbia&s;&s;ed by intere&s;t, we have candidly
obeyed the dictates of ju&s;tice, and the calls of humanity,
in our endeavours to di&s;&s;ipate the clouds of prejudice and
mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, warmed, perhaps, with an hone&s;t di&s;|dain,
at the ungenerous, and, in our opinion, unju&s;t per|&s;ecution,
which, previous to his trial, an officer of rank,
&s;ervice, and character, the de&s;cendant of an illu&s;trious
<PB N="181" REF="186">
family, the &s;on of a nobleman univer&s;ally re&s;pected, a Bri|ton,
a fellow-&s;ubject, had undergone.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The court-martial having examined the evi|dence,
and heard the defence, gave judgment in the&s;e
words: &startq;The court, upon due con&s;ideration of the whole
matter before them, is of opinion, that Lord George
Sackville is guilty of having di&s;obeyed the orders of
Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, whom he was, by his
commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions, directed to obey as com|mander
in chief, according to the rules of war, and it is
the further opinion of this court, that the &s;aid Lord
George Sackville is, and he is hereby adjudged, unfit to
&s;erve his Maje&s;ty in any military capacity what&s;oever.&endq;
His &s;entence was confirmed by the King, who moreover
&s;ignified his plea&s;ure that it &s;hould be given out in pub|lick
orders, not only in Britain, but in America, and every
quarter of the globe, where any Engli&s;h troops happened
to be, that officers, being convinced that neither high
birth nor great employments can &s;helter offences of &s;uch a
nature, and that &s;eeing they are &s;ubject to cen&s;ures much
wor&s;e than death to a man who has any &s;en&s;e of honour,
they may avoid the fatal con&s;equences ari&s;ing from di&s;o|bedience
of orders. To complete the di&s;grace of this un|fortunate
general, his Maje&s;ty in council called for the
council-book, and ordered the name of Lord George
Sackville, to be &s;truck out of the li&s;t of privy-coun|&s;ellors.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. This &s;ummer was di&s;tingui&s;hed by another
trial, &s;till more remarkable. Laurence Earl Ferrers, a no|bleman
of a violent &s;pirit, who had committed many out|rages,
and, in the opinion of all who knew him, given
manifold proofs of in&s;anity, at length perpetrated a mur|ther,
which &s;ubjected him to the cognizance of ju&s;tice.
His deportment to his lady was &s;o brutal, that applica|tion
had been made to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and a &s;epa|ration
effected by act of parliament. Tru&s;tees were
nominated; and one Mr. John&s;on, who had, during the
be&s;t part of his life, been employed in the family, was now
<PB N="182" REF="187">
appointed receiver of the e&s;tates, at the Earl's own reque&s;t.
The conduct of this man, in the courte of his $word$,
gave umbrage to Lord Ferrers, who&s;e di&s;po&s;it$o$ was
equally jea$ous and vindictive. He imagined all his own
family had con&s;pired again&s;t his intere&s;t, and that John&s;on
was one of their accomplices; that he had been $word$|mental
in obtaining the act of parliament, which his lord|&s;hip
con&s;idered as a grievous hard&s;hip; that he had di&s;ap|pointed
him in regard to a certain contract about coal|mines;
in a word, that there was collu&s;ion between
John&s;on and the Earl's adver&s;aries. Fired with the&s;e &s;up|po&s;itions,
he fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment, by giving
John&s;on notice to quit the farm which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the
e&s;tate; but finding the tru&s;tees had confirmed the lea&s;e,
he determined to gratify his revenge by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and
laid his plan accordingly. On Sunday the thirteenth of
January he appointed this unhappy man to come to his
hou&s;e on the Friday following, in order to peru&s;e pan$rs,
or &s;ettle accounts; and John&s;on went thither without the
lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of what was prepared for his reception: for
although he was no &s;tranger to his lord&s;hip$s dangerous
di&s;po&s;ition, and knew he had &s;ome time before incurred his
di&s;plea&s;ure, yet he imagined his re&s;entment had entirely
&s;ub&s;ided, as the Ea$l had of late behaved to him with remark|able
complacency. He, therefore, at the time appointed,
repaired to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e of Staton, in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,
at the di&s;tance of a &s;hort mile from his own habi|tation,
and was admitted by a maid &s;ervant. The Earl
had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed every per&s;on in the hou&s;e, upon various pre|tences,
except three women, who were left in the kitchen.
John&s;on advancing to the door of his apartment was re|ceived
by his lord&s;hip, who de&s;ired him to walk into ano|ther
room, where he joined him in a few minutes, and
then the door was locked on the in&s;ide. After a great
deal of warm expo&s;tulation, the Earl in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;ub|&s;cribing
a paper, acknowledging him&s;elf a villain; and on
his refu&s;ing to comply with this demand, declared he would
put him to death. In vain the unfortunate man remon|&s;trated
<PB N="183" REF="188">
again&s;t this cruel inju&s;tice, and deprecated the in|dignation
of this &s;urious nobleman. He remained deaf to
all his intreaties, drew forth a pi&s;tol, which he had loaded
for the purpo&s;e, and commanding him to implore heaven's
mercy on his knees, &s;hot him through the body, while he
remained in that &s;upplicating attitude. The con&s;equence
of this violence was not immediate death; but his lord|&s;hip,
&s;eeing the wretched victim &s;till alive and &s;en&s;ible,
though agoni&s;ed with pain, felt a momentary motion of
pity. He ordered his &s;ervants to convey Mr. John&s;on up
&s;tairs to a bed, to &s;end for a &s;urgeon, and give immediate
notice of the accident to the wounded man's family. When
Mr. John&s;on's daughter came to the hou&s;e, &s;he was met by
the Earl, who told her he had &s;hot her father on purpo&s;e,
and with deliberation. The &s;ame declaration he made to
the &s;urgeon, on his arrival. He &s;tood by him while he
examined the wound, de&s;cribed the manner in which the
ball had pen$trated, and &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed that it &s;hould be
lodged within the body. When he demanded the &s;ur|geon's
opinion of the wound, the operator thought proper
to tempori&s;e, for $is own &s;afety, as well as for the &s;ake of
the publick, left the Earl &s;hould take &s;ome other de&s;perate
&s;tep, or endeavour to e&s;cape. He, therefore, amu&s;ed him
with hopes of John&s;on's recovery, about which he now
&s;eemed extremely anxious. He &s;upported his &s;pirits by
immoderate drinking, after having retired to another
apartment with the &s;urgeon, whom he de&s;ired to take all
po&s;&s;ible care of his patient. He declared, however, that
he did not r$pent of what he had done; that John&s;on was a
villain, who de&s;erved to die; that, in ca&s;e of his death, he
(the Earl) would &s;urrender him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of Peers,
and take his trial. He &s;aid he could ju&s;tify the action to
his own con&s;cience; and owned his intention was to
have killed John&s;on outright; but as he &s;till &s;urvived, and
was in pain, he de&s;ired that all po&s;&s;ible means might be
u&s;ed for his recovery. Nor did he &s;eem altogether ne|glectful
of his own &s;afety: he endeavoured to tamper with
the &s;urgeon, and &s;ugge&s;t what evidence he &s;hould give
<PB N="184" REF="189">
when called before a court of ju&s;tice. He continued to
drink him&s;elf into a &s;tate of intoxication, and all the cruelty
of his hate &s;eemed to return. He would not allow the
wounded man to be removed to his own hou&s;e, &s;aying, he
would keep him under his own roof, that he might plague
the villain. He returned to the chamber where John&s;on
lay, in&s;ulted him with the mo&s;t opprobrious language,
threatened to &s;hoot him through the head, and could
hardly be re&s;trained from committing further acts of vio|lence
on the poor man, who was already in extrem$$y.
After he retired to bed, the &s;urgeon procured a &s;ufficient
number of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who conveyed Mr. John&s;on in an
ea&s;y chair to his own hou&s;e, where he expired that &s;ame
morning in great agonies. The &s;ame &s;urgeon a&s;&s;embled a
number of armed men to &s;ei&s;e the murtherer, who at fir&s;t
threatened re&s;i&s;tance, but was &s;oon apprehended, endea|vouring
to make his e&s;cape, and committed to the county
pri&s;on. From thence he was conveyed to London by the
jailer of Leice&s;ter, and conducted by the u&s;her of the Black
Rod and his deputy into the Hou&s;e of Lords, where the co|roner's
inque&s;t, and the affidavits touching the murther,
being read, the jailer delivered up his pri&s;oner to the care
of Black Rod, and he was immediately committed to the
Tower. He appeared very calm, compo&s;ed, and uncon|cerned,
from the time of his being apprehended; conver&s;ed
coolly on the &s;ubject of his impri&s;onment; made very per|tinent
remarks upon the nature of the habeas corpus act of
parliament, of which he hoped to avail him&s;elf; and when
he withdrew from the Hou&s;e of Peers, de&s;ired he might
not be vi&s;ited by any of his relations or acquaintances.
His under&s;tanding, which was naturally good, had been
well cultivated; his arguments were rational, but his
conduct was frantick.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The circum&s;tances of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination appeared
&s;o cruel and deliberate, that the people cried aloud for
vengeance; and the government gave up the offender
to the ju&s;tice of his country. The Lord-Keeper Henley
was appointed lord high &s;teward for the trial of Earl
<PB N="185" REF="190">
Ferrers, and &s;at in &s;tate with all the peers and judges in
We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, which was for this purpo&s;e converted
into a very augu&s;t tribunal. On the &s;ixteenth day of
April the delinquent was brought from the Tower in a
coach, attended by the major of the Tower, the gen|tleman-jailer,
the wardours, and a detachment of the
foot-guards. He was brought into court about ten; and
the lord-&s;teward with the peers taking their places, he
was arraigned aloud in the mid&s;t of an infinite concour&s;e of
people, including many foreigners, who &s;eemed wonder|fully
&s;truck with the magnificence and &s;olemnity of the
tribunal. The murther was fully proved by unque&s;tion|able
evidence: but the Earl pleaded in&s;anity of mind;
and, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h this plea, called many witne&s;&s;es
to atte&s;t his lunacy in a variety of in&s;tances, which &s;eemed
too plainly to indicate a di&s;ordered imagination: unfound|ed
jealou&s;y of plots and con&s;piracies, unconnected ravings,
fits of mufing, incoherent ejaculations, &s;udden &s;tarts of
fury, denunciations of unprovoked revenge, frantick
ge&s;ticulations, and a &s;trange caprice of temper, were
proved to have di&s;tingui&s;hed his conduct and deportment.
It appeared that lunacy had been a family taint, and
affected divers of his lord&s;hip's relations, that a &s;ollicitor
of reputation had renounced his bu&s;ine&s;s, on the full
per&s;ua&s;ion of his being di&s;ordered in his brain; that,
long before this unhappy event, his neare&s;t relations had
deliberated upon the expediency of taking out a commi&s;&s;ion
of lunacy again&s;t him, and were prevented by no other
rea&s;on than the apprehen&s;ion of being convicted of <HI>&s;can|dalum
magnatum,</HI> &s;hould the jury find his lord&s;hip <HI>compos
mentis;</HI> a circum&s;tance which in all probability would have
happened, ina&s;much as the Earl's madne&s;s did not appear in
his conver&s;ation, but in his conduct. A phy&s;ician of
eminence, who&s;e practice was confined to per&s;ons la|bouring
under this infirmity, declared that the particu|lars
of the Earl's deportment and per&s;onal behaviour
&s;eemed to indicate lunacy. Indeed, all his neighbours
and acquaintances had long con&s;idered him as a madman;
and a certain noble lord declared in the Hou&s;e of Peers,
<PB N="186" REF="191">
when the bill of &s;eparation was on the carpet, that he
looked upon him in the light of a maniac; and that,
if &s;ome effectual &s;tep was not taken to dive&s;t him of the
power of doing mi&s;chief, he did not doubt but that one
day they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to try him for murther.
The lawyers who managed the pro&s;ecution in behalf of
the crown endeavoured to invalidate the proofs of his
lunacy, by ob&s;erving, that his lord&s;hip was never &s;o much
deprived of his rea&s;on but that he could di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
good and evil; that the murther he had committed
was the effect of revenge for a conceived injury of &s;ome
&s;tanding; that the malice was deliberate, and the plan
artfully conducted; that immediately after the deed was
perpetrated the Earl's conver&s;ation and rea&s;oning was
cool and con&s;i&s;tent, until he drank him&s;elf into a &s;tate of
intoxication; that, in the opinion of the greate&s;t lawyers,
no criminal can avail him&s;elf of the plea of lunacy, pro|vided
the crime was committed during a lucid interval:
but his lord&s;hip, far from exhibiting any marks of in&s;anity,
had, in the cour&s;e of this trial, di&s;played uncommon u$|der&s;tanding
and &s;agacity in examining the witne&s;&s;$$,
and making many &s;hrewd and pertinent ob&s;ervations on
the evidence which was given. The&s;e &s;entiments were
conformable to the opinion of the peers, who unani|mou&s;ly
declared him guilty.&mdash;After all, in examining
the vicious actions of a man who has betrayed mani$$$$
and manifold &s;ymptoms of in&s;anity, it is not e$ly
to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which are committed during the $word$
interval. The &s;ugge&s;tions of madne&s;s are often momentary
and tran&s;ient: the determinations of a lunatick, though
generally ra&s;h and in&s;tantaneous, are &s;ometimes the re|&s;ult
of artful contrivance; but there is always an ab&s;$r|dity
which is the criterion of the di&s;ea&s;e, either in the p$$|mi&s;es
or conclu&s;ion. The Earl, it is true, had formed a
deliberate plan for the perpetration of the murther; but
he had taken no precautions for his own &s;afety or e&s;cape:
and this neglect will the more plainly appear to have
been the criterion of in&s;anity, if we reflect that he
<PB N="187" REF="192">
$$&s;tified what he had done as a meritorious action; and
$clared he would, upon Mr. John&s;on's death, &s;urrender
$$m&s;elf to the Hou&s;e of Lords. Had he been impelled
$ this violence by a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, it could not
$ expected that he &s;hould have taken any mea&s;ure for
$s own pre&s;ervation; but as it was the execution of a
$eliberate &s;cheme, and his lord&s;hip was by no means
$ef$ct$ve in point of ingenuity, he might ea&s;ily have con|$ived
means for concealing the murther, until he &s;hould
$ accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape: and, in our opinion, any
$ th$n a madman would either have taken &s;ome &s;uch
$$$&s;ures, or formed &s;ome plan for the concealment of his
$wn guilt. The de&s;ign it&s;elf &s;eems to have been rather an
$tended &s;acrifice to ju&s;tice than a gratification of r$venge.
$$$her do we think that the &s;anity of his mind was a&s;cer|$ined
by the accuracy and del$$ ration with which he
$$de his remarks, and examin$d the evidence at his trial.
$$ influence of his phrenzy might be pa&s;t; though it
$word$ no &s;ign of &s;ound rea&s;on to &s;upply the pro&s;ecutor with$
&s;uch an argument to his prejudice. H$d his judgement
been $$eally unimpaired, he might have a&s;&s;umed the
$$a&s;que of lunacy for his own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The tryal was continued for two days; and on
the third the Lord Steward&punc; after having made a &s;hort
$word$ touching the Kemous nature of the offence, pro|$ounced
the &s;ame &s;entence of death upon the Earl which
$word$ factors of the lowe&s;t $$als und$$ go; that from the
$ower, in which h$ was impri&s;oned, he &s;hould, on the
Monday following, be led to the common place of exe|$ution,
there to be hanged by the neck, and his body
$ a$terwards diffected and anatomized. This la&s;t part of
$he &s;entence &s;eemed to &s;hock the c$mmal extremely: he
$hanged colour, his jaw quivered, and he appeared to be
$n great agitation; but during the remaining part of his
$with$ he behaved with &s;urpri&s;ing compo&s;ure, and even un|concern.
After he had received &s;entence, the lords his
$udge$, by virtue of a power ve$ied in them, re&s;pited his
execution for one month, that he might have time to
<PB N="188" REF="193">
&s;ettle his temporal and &s;piritual concerns. Before &s;entence
was pa&s;&s;ed, the Earl read a paper, in which he begged
pardon of their lord&s;hips for the trouble he had given, as
well as for having, again&s;t his own inclination, pleaded
lunacy at the reque&s;t of his friends. He thanked them
for the candid trial with which he had been indulged,
and entreated their lord&s;hips to recommend him to the
King for mercy. He afterwards &s;ent a letter to his Ma|je&s;ty,
remon&s;trating, that he was the repre&s;entative of a
very ancient and honourable family, which had been
allied to the crown; and reque&s;ting, that if he could not
be favoured with the &s;pecies of death which, in ca&s;es of
trea&s;on, di&s;tingui&s;hes the nobleman from the plebeian,
he might at lea&s;t, out of con&s;ideration for his family, be
allowed to &s;uffer in the Tower, rather than at the com|mon
place of execution: but this indulgence was refu&s;ed.
From his return to the Tower to the day of his execution
he betrayed no mark of apprehen&s;ion or impatience; but
regulated his affairs with preci&s;ion, and conver&s;ed with|out
concern or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. On the fifth day of May, his body being de|manded
by the &s;heriffs at the Tower-gate, in con&s;equence
of a writ under the great &s;eal of England, directed to the
lieutenant of the Tower, his lord&s;hip de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion
to go in his own landau, and appeared gaily dre&s;&s;ed in a
light-coloured &s;uit of clothes, embroidered with &s;ilver.
He was attended in the landau by one of the &s;heriffs, and
the chaplain of the Tower, followed by the chariots of
the &s;heriffs, a mourning-coach and &s;ix filled with his
friends, and a hear&s;e for the conveyance of his body.
He was guarded by a po&s;&s;e of con&s;tables, a party of hor&s;e|grenadiers,
and a detachment of infantry; and in this
manner the proce&s;&s;ion moved from the Tower, through
an infinite concour&s;e of people, to Tyburn, where the
gallows, and a &s;eaffold erected under it, appeared covered
with black bai&s;e. The Earl behaved with great com|po&s;ure
to Mr. Sheriff Vaillant, who attended him in the
landau: he ob&s;erved, that the gaity of his apparel might
<PB N="189" REF="194">
&s;eem odd on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but that he had particular
$ea&s;ons for wearing that &s;uit of clothes: he took notice of
$he va&s;t multitude which crouded around him, brought
$hither, he &s;uppo&s;ed, by curio&s;ity to &s;ee a nobleman hanged:
$e told the &s;heriff he had applied to the King, by letter,
$hat he might be permitted to die in the Tower, where
the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, one of his ance&s;tors, had been behead|$d
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; an application
which, he &s;aid, he had made with the more confidence, as
$ had the honour to quarter part of his Maje&s;ty's arms.
He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure at being executed as a
common felon, expo&s;ed to the eyes of &s;uch a multitude.
The chaplain, who had never been admitt$d to him before,
$inting that &s;ome account of his lord&s;hip's &s;entiments on re|$igion
would be expected by th$ publick, he made an&s;wer,
that he did not think him&s;elf accountable to the publick
for his private &s;entiments; that he had always adored one
God, the creator of the univer&s;e; and, with re&s;pect to
any particular opinions of his own, he had never propa|gated
them, or endeavoured to make pro&s;elytes, becau&s;e
$ethought it was criminal to di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|$ion
of his country, as Lord B&mdash;had done, by
the publication of his writings. He added, that the great
$umber of &s;ects, and th$ multiplication of religious di&s;|$utes,
had almo&s;t bani&s;hed morality. With regard to
the crime for which he &s;uffered, he declared that he had
$o malice again&s;t Mr. John&s;on; and that the murther
$as owing to a perturbation of mind, occa&s;ioned by a
$ariety of cro&s;&s;es and vexations. When he approached
$$ place of execution, he expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to
$e and take leave of a certain per&s;on who waited in a
$$ach; a per&s;on for whom $e entertained the mo&s;t &s;incere
$gard and affection: but the &s;heriff prudently ob&s;erving
$at &s;uch an interview might &s;hock him, at a time when
$e had occa&s;ion for all his fortitude and recollection, he
$quie&s;eed in the ju&s;tne&s;s of the remark, and delivered to
$im a pocket-book, a ring, and a pur&s;e, de&s;iring they
$ight be given to that per&s;on, whom he now declined
<PB N="190" REF="195">
&s;eeing. On his arrival at Tyburn he came out of th$
landau, and a&s;cended the &s;caffold with a firm &s;tep and
undaunted countenance. He refu&s;ed to join the c$$aplai$
in his devotions; but kneeling with him on black cu&s;$ions
he repeated the Lord's Prayer, which, he &s;aid, he had al|ways
admired; and added with great energy, &startq;O Lord
forgive me all my errors, pardon all my &s;ins.&endq; After
this exerci&s;e, he pre&s;ented his watch to Mr. Sheriff Vai$|lant,
thanked him and the other gentleman for all thei$
civilities; and &s;ignified his de&s;ire of being bur$ed a$
Breden, or Stanton, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. Finally, he gra$$|fied
the executioner with a pur&s;e of money: then, th$
halter being adju&s;ted to his neck, he &s;tepped upon a littl$
&s;tage, erected upon &s;prings, on the middle of the $word$
and the cap being pulled over his eyes, the &s;heriff made$
&s;ignal, at which the &s;tage fell from under his feet, and h$
was left &s;u&s;pended. His body, having hung an hour and
five minutes, was cut down, placed in the hear&s;e, an$
conveyed to the publick theatre for di&s;&s;ection, where bein$
opened, and lying for &s;ome days as the &s;ubject of a pub$$$$
lecture, at length it was carried off, and privat$ly $n
terred. Without all doubt, this unhappy noblem$n$
di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o dangerou&s;ly mi&s;chievous, that it becam$
nece&s;&s;ary for the good of &s;ociety, either to confirm $word$
for life, as an incorrigible lunatick, or give him $word$
once as a &s;acrifice to ju&s;tice. Perhaps, $word$
ab&s;urd nor unrea&s;onable regulation in the $word$
dive&s;t all lunaticks of the privilege of i$$anity, and, $word$
ca&s;es of enormity, &s;ubject them to the common $word$
of the law; for though, in the eye of ca&s;u$$t $y, coate$
ou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t enter into the con&s;titution of g$$le, $word$
&s;equences of murther committed by a $word$ may $word$
as pernicious to &s;ociety as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t $word$ $word$
deliberate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: and the puni&s;hment of d$ath$
be hardly deemed unju&s;t or rigorous, when $word$
mi&s;chievous being, dive&s;ted of all the percep$$$ns of $word$
and humanity. At any rate, as the nobi$ity of $word$
are rai&s;ed by many illu&s;trious di&s;tinctions above the $word$
<PB N="191" REF="196">
of plebeians, and as they are eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed from
them in &s;uffering puni&s;hment for high trea&s;on, which the
law con&s;iders as the mo&s;t atrocious crime that can be com|mitted,
it might not be unworthy of the notice of the
legi&s;lature to deliberate whether &s;ome &s;uch pre-eminence
ought not to be extended to noblemen convicted of other
crimes; in order to alleviate as much as po&s;&s;ible the di&s;|grace
of noble families, which have de&s;erved well of their
country; to avoid any circum&s;tances that may tend to
dimini&s;h the lu&s;tre of the Engli&s;h nobility in the eyes of
foreign nations; or to bring it in contempt with the com|mon
people of our own, already too licentious, and prone
to aboli&s;h tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which &s;erve as the ba&s;is of
decorum, order, and &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Homicide is the reproach of England: one
would imagine there is &s;omething in the climate of this
country, that not only di&s;po&s;es the natives to this inhuman
outrage, but even infects foreigners who re&s;ide among
them. Certain it is, high pa&s;&s;ions will break out into
the mo&s;t enormous violences in that country where they
are lea&s;t controlled by the re&s;trait of regulation and di&s;|cipline,
and it is equally certain, that in no civilized
country under the &s;un there is &s;uch a r$laxation of di&s;|cipline,
either religious or civil, as in England. The month
of Augu&s;t produced a remarkable in&s;tance of de&s;perate
revenge, perpetrated by one Stirn, a native of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el,
in&s;lamed and exa&s;perated by a fal&s;e punctilio of honour.
This unhappy young man was de&s;cended of a good family,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many accompli&s;hments both of mind and
per&s;on: but his character was di$$ingui&s;hed by &s;uch a jea|lous
&s;en&s;ibility, as rendered him unhappy in him&s;elf, and
di&s;agreeable to his acquaintance. After having for &s;ome
years performed the office of u&s;her in a boarding &s;chool,
he was admitted to the hou&s;e of one Mr. Matthews, a
&s;urgeon, in order to teach him the cla&s;&s;icks, and in&s;truct
his children in mu&s;ick, which he perfectly under&s;tood.
He had not long re&s;ide$ in this family, when the &s;urgeon
took umbrage at &s;ome part of his conduct, taxed him
<PB N="192" REF="197">
roughly with fraud and ingratitude, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his
removing to another lodging. Whether he rej$cted this
intimation, or found diffculty in procuring another apart|ment,
the &s;urgeon re&s;olved to expel him by violence,
called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a peace-officer, and turned him out
into the &s;treet in the night, after having loaded him with
the mo&s;t provoking reproaches. The&s;e injuries and di&s;|graces
operating upon a mind jealous by nature, and galled
by adver&s;ity, produced a kind of phrenzy of re&s;entment,
and he took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of &s;acrificing Mat|thews
to his revenge. Next day, having provided a ca&s;e
of pi&s;tols, and charged them for the occa&s;ion, he $word$|forced
his rage by drinking an unu&s;ual quantity of $word$
and repairing in the evening to a pu$lick-hou&s;e which
Mr. Matthews frequented in the neighbourhood of Ha$$$$.
Garden. There he accordingly found the unhappy vi$$m
&s;itting with &s;ome of his friends; and the &s;urgeon, in&s;t$ad
of palliating his former conduct, began to in&s;ult him $word$
with the mo&s;t opprobious invectives. Stirn, exa&s;p$$$t$d
by this additional indignity, pulled his pi&s;tols from $is
bo&s;om, &s;hot the &s;urgeon, who immediately expired and
di&s;charged the other at his own brea&s;t&punc; though his con|fu&s;ion
was &s;uch that it did not take effect. He was $p|prehended
on the &s;pot, and conveyed to pri&s;on, where,
for &s;ome days, he refu&s;ed all kind of &s;u&s;tenance, but
afterwards became more compo&s;ed. At his trial he
pleaded in&s;anity of mind; but being found guilty, he
re&s;olved to anticipate the execution of the &s;entence.
That &s;ame evening he drank poi&s;on; and notwith&s;tanding
all the remedies that could be admini&s;tered, died in &s;trong
convul&s;ions. His body was publickly di&s;&s;ected, accord|ing
to the &s;entence of the law, and afterwards interred
with tho&s;e marks of indignity which are re&s;erved for the
perpetrators of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. We &s;hall clo&s;e the dome&s;tick occurrences of
this year with an account of two incidents&punc; which, though,
of a very different nature in re&s;pect to each other, n$ver|thele&s;s
concurred in demon&s;trating that the internal
<PB N="193" REF="198">
wealth and vigour of the nation were neither drained nor
dimini&s;hed by the enormous expen&s;e and inconveniencies
of the war. The committee appointed to manage the un|dertaking
for a new bridge over the river Thames at
Black-friars having received and examined a variety of
plans pre&s;ented by different arti&s;ts, at length gave the
preference to the de&s;ign of one Mr. Mylne, a young archi|tect,
a native of North-Britain, ju&s;t returned from the
pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies at Rome, where he had gained
the prize in the capital, which the academy of that city
be&s;tows on him who produces the mo&s;t beautiful and u&s;e|ful
plan on a given &s;ubject of architecture. This young
man being in London, on his return to his own country,
was advi&s;ed to declare him&s;elf a candidate for the &s;uperin|tendency
of the new bridge; and the plan which he pre|&s;ented
was approved and adopted. The place being
already a&s;certained, the lord-mayor of London, attended
by the committee, and a great concour&s;e of people, re|paired
to Black-friars, and laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the
bridge, placing upon it a plate, with an in&s;cription, which
does more honour to the publick &s;pirit of the undertakers
than to the cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te of the author<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ultimo die Octobris, anno ab incarnatione MDCCLX, Au&s;picati&s;&s;imo principe Georgio Tertio Regnum jam inuente, Pontis hujus, in $eipubli$$$ commodum Urbi&s;que maje&s;tatem (Lat&egrave; $word$ flagrante bello) &agrave; S.

The other
<PB N="194" REF="199">
in&s;tance that denoted the wealth and &s;pirit of the nation,
was the indifference and unconcern with which they bore
the lo&s;s of a va&s;t magazine of naval &s;tores belonging to
the dock-yard at Port&s;mouth, which, in the month of
July, was &s;et on fire by lightning, and con&s;i&s;ting of
combu&s;tibles, burned with &s;uch fury, notwith&s;tanding all
the endeavours of the workmen in the yard, the &s;ailors
in the harbour, and the troops in the town, that before
a &s;top was put to the conflagration, it had con&s;umed a
variety of &s;tores, to an immen&s;e value. The damage,
however, was &s;o immediately repaired, that it had no &s;ort
of effect in di&s;concerting any plan, or even in retarding
any naval preparation.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. How important the&s;e preparations mu&s;t have
been may be judged from the prodigious increa&s;e of the
navy, which, at this juncture, amounted to one hundred
and twenty &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fire&s;hips,
&s;loops, bombs, and tenders. Of the&s;e capital &s;hips,
&s;eventeen were &s;tationed in the Ea&s;t-Indies, twenty for
the defence of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, twelve in North-America,
ten in the Mediterranean, and &s;ixty-one, either
on the coa&s;t of France, in the harbours of England, or
c$$i&s;ing in the Engli&s;h &s;eas for the protection of the Bri|ti&s;h
commerce. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e numerous and
powerful armaments, the enemy, who had not a &s;hip of
the lin$ at &s;ea, were &s;o alert with their &s;mall privateers and
armed ve&s;&s;els, that, in the beginning of this year, from
the fir&s;t of March to the tenth of June, they had made prize
of two hundred ve&s;&s;els belonging to Great-Britain and
Ireland. The whole number of Briti&s;h &s;hips taken by
them, from the fir&s;t day of June, in the year one thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, to the fir&s;t of June in
<PB N="195" REF="200">
the pre&s;ent year, amounted to two thou&s;and five hundred
and thirty-nine; of the&s;e &s;eventy-eight were privateers,
three hundred and twenty-one were re-taken, and about
the &s;ame number ran&s;omed. In the &s;ame &s;pace of time,
the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers had made captures of nine hundred and
forty-four ve&s;&s;els, including two hundred and forty-two
privateers, many fi&s;hing-boats and &s;mall coa&s;ters, the value
of which hardly defrayed the expen&s;e of condemnation.
That &s;uch a &s;mall proportion of &s;hips &s;hould be taken from
the enemy is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider the
terrible &s;hocks their commerce had previou&s;ly received,
and the great number of their mariners impri&s;oned in
England: but the prodigious number of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els
taken by their petty coa&s;ting privateers, in the face of
&s;uch mighty armaments, numerous crui&s;ers, and convoys,
&s;eems to argue, that either the Engli&s;h &s;hips of war were
inactive or improperly di&s;po&s;ed, or that the merchants
hazarded their &s;hips without convoy. Certain it is, in
the cour&s;e of this year we find fewer prizes taken from
the enemy, and fewer exploits atchieved at &s;ea, than we
had occa&s;ion to record in the annals of the pa&s;t. Not
that the pre&s;ent year is altogether barren of events which
rebound to the honour of our marine commanders. We
have, in recounting the tran&s;actions of the preceding
year, mentioned a &s;mall armament equipped at Dunkirk,
under the command of M. de Thurot, who, $word$
of all the vigilance of the Briti&s;h commander &s;tatiONE in
the Downs, found means to e&s;cape from the $$rbour in
the month of October la&s;t, and arrived at Gott$aburgh,
$n Sweden, from whence he proceeded to Bergen, in Nor|way.
His in&s;tructions were to make occa&s;ional de&s;cents
upon the coa&s;t of Ireland, and, by dividing the troops,
and di&s;tracting the attention of the government in that
kingdom, to facilitate the enterpri&s;e $word$ M. De Con&s;lans,
the fate of which we have already $arrated. The origi|nal
armament of Thurot con&s;i&s;t $ of five &s;hips, one of
which, called the M$re&s;chat de $word$, was mounted
with forty-four guns; the Begon, the Blond, the Terp|&s;ichore,
<PB N="196" REF="201">
&s;ichore, had thirty guns each, and the Marante carried
twenty-four. The number of &s;oldiers put on board this
little fleet did not exceed one thou&s;and two hundred and
&s;eventy, exclu&s;ive of mariners, to the number of &s;even
hundred; but two hundred of the troops were &s;ent &s;ick
on &s;hore, before the armament &s;ailed from Dunkirk;
and in their voyage between Gottenburgh and Bergen they
lo&s;t company of the Begon, during a violent &s;torm. The
&s;everity of the weather detained them nineteen days at
Bergen, at the expiration of which they &s;et &s;ail for the
we&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland, and di&s;covered the northern
part of Ireland in the latter end of January. The in|tention
of Thurot was to make a de&s;cent about Derry;
but before this de&s;ign could be executed, the weather
growing tempe&s;tuous, and the wind blowing off &s;hore,
they were driven out to &s;ea, and in the night lo&s;t &s;ight
of the Marante, which never joined them in the &s;equel.
After having been tempe&s;t-beaten for &s;ome time, and ex|po&s;ed
to a very &s;canty allowance of provi&s;ion, the officers
reque&s;ted of Thurot that he would return to France,
le&s;t they &s;hould all peri&s;h by famine; but he lent a deaf $ar
to this propo&s;al, and frankly told them he could not re|turn
to France without having &s;truck &s;ome &s;troke for the
&s;ervice of his country. Neverthele&s;s, in hopes of meeting
with &s;ome refre&s;hment, he &s;teered to the i&s;land or I&s;la,
where the troops were landed, and here they found black
cattle, and a &s;mall &s;upply of oatmeal, for which they paid
a rea&s;onable price; and it mu&s;t be owned, Thurot him|&s;elf
behaved with great moderation and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. While this &s;pirited adventurer &s;truggled with
the&s;e wants and difficulties, his arrival in tho&s;e &s;eas &s;illed
the whole kingdom with alarm. Bodies of regular troop;
and militia were po&s;ted along the coa&s;ts of Ireland and
Scotland; and be&s;ides the &s;quadron of Commodore Boys,
who &s;ailed to the northward on purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue the
enemy, other &s;hips of war were ordered to &s;$our the
Bri&s;tol channel, and crui&s;e between Scotland and Ire|land.
The weather no &s;ooner permitted Thurot to pur|&s;ue
<PB N="197" REF="202">
his de&s;tination, than he &s;ailed from I&s;la to the bay of
Carrickfergus, in Ireland, and made all the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations for a de&s;cent; which was accordingly effected
with &s;ix hundred men, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of Febru|ary.
Lieutenant-Colonel Jennings, who commanded
four companies of raw undi&s;ciplined men at Carrickfergus,
having received information that three &s;hips had anchored
about two miles and a half from the ca&s;tle, which was
ruinous and defencele&s;s, immediately detached a party to
make ob&s;ervations, and ordered the French pri&s;oners
there confined to be removed to Belfa&s;t. Mean while,
the enemy landing without oppo&s;ition, advanced towards
the town, which they found as well guarded as the nature
of the place, which was entirely open, and the circum|&s;tances
of the Engli&s;h commander, would allow. A re|gular
attack was carried on, and a &s;pirited defence made<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">One circum&s;tance that attended this di&s;pute de&s;erven to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, a$ an in&s;tance of that courage, mingled with humanity, which con&s;titutes true heroi&s;m. While the French and Engli&s;h were hotly en|gaged in one of the &s;treets, a little child $an playfully between them, having no idea of the danger to which it was expo&s;ed: a common &s;oldier of the enemy, perceiving the life of this poor innocent at &s;take, grounded his piece, advanced deliberately between the line$ of fire, took up the child in his arms, conveyed it to a place of &s;afety; then returning to his place, re&s;umed his mu&s;ket, and renewed his ho&s;tility.</NOTE>,
untill the ammunition of the Engli&s;h failed: then Colonel
Jennings retired in order to the ca&s;tle, which, however,
was in all re&s;pects untenable; for, be&s;ides a breach in the
wall near fifty feet wide, they found them&s;elves de&s;titute
of provi&s;ion and ammunition. Neverthele&s;s, they re|pul&s;ed
the a&s;&s;ailants in their fir&s;t attack even after the
gate was bur&s;t open, and &s;upplied the want of &s;hot with
&s;tones and rubbi&s;h. At length the Colonel and his
troops were obliged to &s;urrender, on condition that they
&s;hould not be &s;ent pri&s;oners to France, but be ran&s;omed,
by &s;ending thither an equal number of French pri&s;oners
from Great-Britain or Ireland: that the ca&s;tle &s;hould not
be demoli&s;hed, nor the town of Carrickfergus plundered
or burned, on condition that the mayor and corporation
&s;hould furni&s;h the French troops with nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions.
<PB N="198" REF="203">
The enemy, after this exploit, did not pre&s;ume to advance
farther into the country; a &s;tep which indeed they could
not have taken with any regard to their own &s;afety; for
by this time a con&s;iderable body of regular troops was
a&s;&s;$mbled; and the people of the country manife&s;t$d a
laudable &s;pirit of loyalty and re&s;olution, crowding in great
numbers to Belfa&s;t, to offer their &s;ervice again&s;t the in|vaders.
The&s;e circum&s;tances, to which the enemy were no
&s;trangers, and the defeat of Conflans, which they had
al&s;o learned, obliged them to quit their conque&s;t, and re|embark
with &s;ome precipit$tion, after having laid Carrick|fergus
under moderate contribution.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The fate they e&s;caped on &s;hore they &s;oon met
with at &s;ea. Captain John Elliot, who commanded three
frigates at Kin&s;ale, and had, in the cour&s;e of this war, more
than once already di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, even in his early
youth, by extraordinary acts of valour, was informed by
a di&s;patch from the Duke of Bedford, lord-lieutenant of
Ireland, that three of the enemy's &s;hips lay at anchor in
the bay of Carrickfergus, and thither he immediately
&s;haped his cour&s;e in the &s;hip Aeolus, accompanied by the
Pallas and Brilliant, under the command of the Captains
Clements and Logie. On the twenty-eighth day of
February they de&s;cried the enemy, and gave cha&s;e, in &s;ight
of the I&s;le of Mann; and about nine in the morning, Cap|tain
Elliot, in his own &s;hip, engaged the Bellei&s;le, com|manded
by Thurot, although con&s;iderably his &s;uperior
in &s;trength of men, number of guns, and weight of metal.
In a few minutes his con&s;orts were al&s;o engaged with the
other two &s;hips of the enemy. After a warm action,
maintained with great &s;pirit on all &s;ides for an hour and
a half, Captain Elliot's lieutenant boarded the Bellei&s;le,
and, &s;triking her colours with his own hand, the com|mander
&s;ubmitted: his example was immediately followed
by the other French captains, and the Engli&s;h commo|dore,
taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prizes, conveyed them into
the bay of Ram&s;ay, in the I&s;le of Mann, that their damage
might be repaired. Though the Bellei&s;le was very leaky,
<PB N="199" REF="204">
and had lo&s;t her bolt&s;prit, mizen-ma&s;t, and main-yard,
in all probability the victory would not have been &s;o ea&s;ily
obtained, had not the gallant Thurot fallen during the
action. The victor had not even the con&s;olation to per|form
the la&s;t offices to his brave enemy; for his body was
thrown into the &s;ea by his own people in the hurry of the
engagement. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h did not
exceed forty men killed and wounded, whereas above three
hundred of the enemy were &s;lain or di&s;abled. The &s;ervice
performed on this occa&s;ion was deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the
peace and commerce of Ireland, that the thanks of the
Hou&s;e of Commons in that kingdom were voted to the
conquerors of Thurot, as well as to Lieutenant-Colonel
Jennings, for his &s;pirited behaviour at Carrickfergus; and
the freedom of the city of Cork was pre&s;ented in &s;ilver
boxes to the Captains Elliot, Clements, and Logie. The
name of Thurot was become terrible to all the trading
&s;ea-ports of Great-Britain and Ireland; and therefore the
defeat and capture of his &s;quadron were celebrated with
as hearty rejoicings as the mo&s;t important victory could
have produced.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. In the beginning of April another engage|ment
between four frigates, &s;till more equally matched, had
a different i&s;&s;ue, though not le&s;s honourable for the Briti&s;h
commanders. Captain Skinner, of the Biddeford, and
Captain Kennedy, of the Flamborough, both frigates,
&s;ailed on a crui&s;e from Li&s;bon; and on the fourth day of
April fell in with two large French frigates, convoy to a
fleet of merchant-&s;hips, which the Engli&s;h captains im|mediately
re&s;olved to engage. The enemy did not decline
the battle, which began about half an hour after &s;ix in the
evening, and raged with great fury till eleven. By this
time the Flamborough had lo&s;t &s;ight of the Biddeford, and
the frigate with which Captain Kennedy was engaged
bore away with all the &s;ail &s;he could carry. He pur&s;ued
her till noon the next day, when &s;he had left him &s;o far
a&s;tern, that he lo&s;t &s;ight of her, and returned to Li&s;bon,
with the lo&s;s of fifteen men killed and wounded, including
<PB N="200" REF="205">
the lieutenant of marines, and con&s;iderable damage both
in her hull and rigging. In three days he was joined by
the Biddeford, which however compelled her antagoni&s;t
to give way, and pur&s;ued her till &s;he was out of &s;ight. In
about an hour after the action began, Captain Skinner was
killed by a cannon-ball, and the command devolved to
Lieutenant Knollis, &s;on to the Earl of Banbury<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Five &s;ons of this nobleman were remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed in this war &punc; The fourth and fifth were dangerou&s;ly wounded at the battle of Minden: the &s;econd was hunt in the reduction of Guadaloupe: Lord Wallingford, the elde&s;t, received a &s;hot at Carrickfergu$; and the third was &s;lain in this engagement.</NOTE>, who
maintained the battle with great &s;pirit, even after he was
wounded, until he received a &s;econd &s;hot in his body,
which proved mortal. Then the ma&s;ter a&s;&s;uming the
direction, continued the engagement with equal re&s;olution,
untill the enemy made his e&s;cape, which he the more ea&s;ily
accompli&s;hed, as the Biddeford was di&s;abled in her ma&s;ts
and rigging.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The bravery of five Iri&s;hmen and a boy,
belonging to the crew of a &s;hip from Waterford, de&s;erves
commemoration. The &s;hip, in her return from Bilboa,
laden with brandy and iron, being taken by a French
privateer off U&s;hant, about the middle of April, the cap|tors
removed the ma&s;ter and all the hands but the&s;e five
men and the boy, who were left to a&s;&s;i&s;t nine Frenchmen
in navigating the ve&s;&s;el to France. The&s;e &s;tout Hiber|nians
immediately formed a plan of in&s;urrection, and
executed it with &s;ucce&s;s. Four of the French mariners
being below deck, three aloft among the rigging, one at the
helm, and another walking the deck, Brian, who headed
the enterpri&s;e, tripped up the heels of the French &s;t$er&s;|man,
&s;ei&s;ed his pi&s;tol, and di&s;charged it at him who walked
the deck, but mi&s;&s;ing the mark, he knocked him down
with the butt-end of the piece. At the &s;ame time hollow|ing
to his confederates below, they a&s;&s;ailed the enemy with
their own broad-&s;words, and &s;oon compelling them to
&s;ubmit, came upon deck, and &s;hut the hatches. Brian
being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the quarter-deck, tho&s;e who
<PB N="201" REF="206">
were aloft called for quarter, and &s;urrendered without
oppo&s;ition. The Iri&s;h having thus obtained a complete
victory, almo&s;t without blood&s;hed, and &s;ecured the pri|&s;oners,
another difficulty occurred: neither Brian nor any
of his a&s;&s;ociates could read or write, or knew the lea&s;t
principle of navigation; but &s;up o&s;ing his cour&s;e to be
north, he &s;teered at venture, and the fir&s;t land he made
was the neighbourhood of Youghall, where he happily
arrived with his pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The only con&s;iderable damage &s;u&s;tained by the
navy of Great-Britain, &s;ince the commencement of this
year, was the lo&s;s of the Ramillies, a magnificent &s;hip
of the &s;econd rate, belonging to the &s;quadron which
Admiral Bo&s;cawen commanded on the coa&s;t of France
in order to watch the motions and di&s;tre&s;s the commerce
of that re&s;tle&s;s, enterpri&s;ing enemy. In the beginning
of February a &s;eries of &s;tormy weather obliged the
admiral to return from the bay of Quiberon to Ply|mouth,
where he arrived with much difficulty; but the
Ramillies over&s;hot the entrance to the Sound, and being
embayed near a point called the Boit-head, about four
leagues higher up the channel, was da&s;hed in pieces
among the rocks, after all her anchors and cables had
given way. All her officers and men, amounting to &s;even
hundred, peri&s;hed on this occa&s;ion, except one mid&s;hip|man
and twenty-five mariners, who had the good fortune
to &s;ave them&s;elves by leaping on the rocks, as the hull was
thrown forwards, and rai&s;ed up by the &s;ucceeding billows.
Such were the mo&s;t material tranfactions of the year,
relating to the Briti&s;h empire in the &s;eas of Europe.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. We &s;hall now tran&s;port the reader to the con|tinent
of North-America, which, as the theatre of war,
&s;till maintained its former importance. The French
emi&s;&s;aries from the province of Loui&s;iana had exerci&s;ed their
arts of in&s;inuation with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s among the Chero|kees,
a numerous and powerful nation of Indians, &s;ettled
on the con&s;ines of Virginia and Carolina, that they had
infringed the peace with the Engli&s;h towards the latter
<PB N="202" REF="207">
end fo the la&s;t year, and begun ho&s;tilities, by plundering,
ma&s;&s;acring, and &s;calping &s;everal Briti&s;h &s;ubjects of the
more &s;outhern provinces. Mr. Lyttelton, governour of
South-Carolina, having received information of the&s;e out|rages,
obtained the nece&s;&s;ary aids from the a&s;&s;embly of his
province, for maintaining a con&s;iderable body of forces,
which was rai&s;ed with great expedition. He marched in
the beginning of October, at the head of eight hundred
provincials, re-enforced with three hundred regular troops,
and penetrated into the heart of the country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the Cherokees, who were &s;o much intimidated by his
vigour and di&s;patch, that they &s;ent a deputation of their
chiefs to &s;ue for peace, which was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by a new
treaty, dictated by the Engli&s;h governour. They obliged
them&s;elves to renounce the French intere&s;t; to deliver
up all the &s;pies and emi&s;&s;aries of that nation then re&s;ident
among them; to &s;urrender to ju&s;tice tho&s;e of their own
people who had been concerned in murthering and &s;calp|ing
the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; and for the performance of the&s;e
articles two-and-twenty of their head men were put as
ho&s;tages into the hands of the governour. So little re|gard,
however, was paid by the&s;e &s;avages to this &s;olemn ac|commodation,
that Mr. Lyttelton had been returned but a
few days from their country, when they attempted to &s;ur|pri&s;e
the Engli&s;h fort Prince George, near the frontiers of
Carolina, by going thither in a body, on pretence of de|livering
up &s;ome murtherers; but the commanding officer
perceiving &s;ome &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances in their be|haviour,
acted with &s;uch vigilance and circum&s;pection as
entirely fru&s;trated their de&s;ign<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This attempt was conducted in the following manner, havi$g $word$ been conce$ted with the two-and-twenty hollages who re&s;ided in the $word$&punc; On the &s;ixteenth day of February, two Indian women appearing at $word$, on the other &s;ide of the river, Mr. Dogharty, one of the officers of the $word$ went out to a&s;k them what news. While he was engaged in $word$ with the&s;e females, the great Indian warrior Ocunna&s;tota joining them, de|&s;ired he would call the commanding officer, to whom, he &s;aid, he had $word$ thing to propo&s;e. Accordingly, Lieutenant Cotymore appearing, $word$ by En&s;ign Bell, D$gharty, and F$&s;ter the interpreter, Ocunna&s;tota told him he had &s;omethin$ of con&s;$quence to impart to the governour$ whom he pur|po&s;ed to vi&s;it, and d$&s;ir$d he might be attended by a white man, as a &s;afe|guard. The lieutenant $&s;&s;uring him he &s;hould have a &s;afeguard, the Indian declared he would then go $nd catch a hor&s;e for him; &s;o laying, he &s;wung a bridle thrice over $span$ a &s;ingal, an$ immediately twenty-five or thirty mu&s;quets, from different ambu&s;cades, were di&s;charged at the Engli&s;h officers. M. Cotymore r$ceived a &s;hot in his left brea&s;t, and in a few days expired; Mr. Bell was wounde$ in the call of the l$g, and the interpreter in the but|to$k. En&s;i$$ Milne, $word$ remaines&punc; in the fort, wa$$ &s;ooner informed of this treaher, $word$ an he $word$ the $word$ to &s;hackle the ho&s;tages; in the evecution of which $word$ one man was killed upon the &s;pot, and another wounde$ in the $orehead with a tom$$awk: circum&s;tances which, added to the rou$ther of the lieutenant incen&s;ed the gu$i$on to &s;uch a degree, $word$ it was ju$ged ab&s;olutely $word$ to put the $span$ without further he&s;itation. In the evening a party of I$dian $uppro$ ching the &s;ort, and firing two &s;ignal pieces, cried aloud in the $span$ &startq;Fight m$$fully, and you &s;hall be $word$.&endq; Then they began an attack, and con|tinued &s;i$ing a$ $ight upon the $ort, without doing the lea&s;t executi$on. That a de&s;ign was concerted between them and the ho&s;tages appeared plain|ly from the nature of this a&s;&s;ault; and this &s;$ppo&s;ition was converted into a certainty next day, when $ome o$ the $word$ $$arching the apartment in which the ho&s;tag$s $word$, found a $word$ of poi$on, p$$bably de&s;igned to be emptied into the well, and &s;$veral to$ohawks buried in the earth; which $$jons had been privately convey$d to them by the$r friends, who were per|mitted to vi&s;it them without interruption. On the third day of March, the $urt at Ninety &s;ix $word$ attacked by two hundred Ch$rokee Indians with mu&s;|q$try, which had little or no effect, &s;o that they were fore d$ to retire with &s;ome lo&s;s, and revenged them&s;elves on the open country, burning and $avaring all the hou&s;es and plantations belonging to Engli&s;h &s;$ttlers in this part of the country, and all along the frontiers of Virginia. Not contented with pillaging and de&s;troying the habitations, they wantoned in the mo&s;t horrible barbarities; and their motions were &s;o &s;ecret and &s;udden, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants to know where the &s;torm would bur&s;t, or take proper precautions for their own defence, &s;o that a great number of the back &s;ettlements were totally abandoned.</NOTE>. Thus di&s;appointed,
<PB N="203" REF="208">
they wreaked their vengeance upon the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects
trading in their country, all of whom they butchered
without mercy. Not contented with this barbarous &s;a|crifice,
they made incur&s;ions to the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements at
the Long Lanes, and the forks of the Broad River, and
ma&s;&s;acred about forty defencele&s;s coloni&s;ts, who repo&s;ed
them&s;elves in full &s;ecurity on the peace &s;o lately ratified.
As views of intere&s;t could not have induced them to act in
this manner, and their revenge had not been inflamed by
<PB N="204" REF="209">
and fre&s;h provocation, the&s;e violences mu&s;t be imputed
to the in&s;tigation of French incendiaries; and too plainly
evinced the nece&s;&s;ity of crowing our American conque&s;ts
with the reduction of Loui&s;iana, from whence the&s;e
emi&s;&s;aries were undoubtedly di&s;patched.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The cruelty and mi&s;chief with which the Che|rokees
pro&s;ecuted their renewed ho&s;tilities alarmed all the
&s;outhern colonies of the Engli&s;h; and application was
made for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mr. Amher&s;t, the commander in
chief of the King's forces in America. He forthwith
detached twelve hundred cho&s;en men to South-Carolina,
under the command of Colonel Montgomery, brother to
the Earl of Eglinton, an officer of approved conduct, and
di&s;tingui&s;hed gallantry. Immediately after his arrival at
Charles-town, he advanced to Ninety-&s;ix, and proceeded
to Twelve-mile River, which he pa&s;&s;ed in the beginning of
June, without oppo&s;ition. He continued his route by
forced marches, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of
the Indian town called Little Keowee, where he encamped
in an advantageous &s;ituation. Having rea&s;on to believe
the enemy were not yet appri&s;ed of his coming, he re|&s;olved
to ru&s;h upon them in the night by &s;urpri&s;e. With
this view, leaving his tents &s;tanding, with a &s;ufficient
guard for the camp and waggons, he marched through
the woods towards the Cherokee town of E&s;taroe, at the
di&s;tance of five-and-twenty miles; and in his route de|tached
a company of light infantry to de&s;troy the village
of Little Keowee, where they were received with a &s;mart
fire, but they ru&s;hed in with their bayonets, and all the
men were put to the &s;word. The main body proceeded
&s;traight to E&s;tatoe, which they reached in the morning,
but it had been abandoned about half an hour before
their arrival. Some few of the Indians, who had not time
to e&s;cape, were &s;lain; and the town, con&s;i&s;ting of two
hundred hou&s;es, well &s;tored with provi&s;ion, ammunition
and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, was fir&s;t plundered, and ther
reduced to a&s;hes; &s;ome of the wretched inhabitants who
concealed them&s;elves peri&s;hing in the flames. It was
<PB N="205" REF="210">
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike a terror into tho&s;e &s;avages by &s;ome ex|amples
of &s;everity; and the &s;oldiers became deaf to all the
&s;ugge&s;tions of mercy, when they found in one of the In|dian
towns the body of an Engli&s;hman, whom they had put
to the torture that very morning. Colonel Montgomery
followed his blow with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. In the &s;pace
of a few hours he de&s;troyed Sugar-town, which was as
large as E&s;tatoe, and every village and hou&s;e in the Lower
Nation. The Indian villages in this part of the world
were agreeably &s;ituated, generally confi&s;ting of about one
hundred hou&s;es, neatly and commodiou&s;ly built, and well
&s;upplied with provi&s;ion. They had in particular large
magazines of corn, which were con&s;umed in the flames.
All the men that were taken &s;uffered immediate death;
but the greater part of the nation had e&s;caped with the
utmo&s;t precipitation. In many hou&s;es the beds were yet
warm, and the tables &s;pread with victuals. Many loaded
guns went off while the hou&s;es were burning. The
&s;avages had not time to &s;ave their mo&s;t valuable effects.
The &s;oldiers found &s;ome money, three or four watches, a
good quantity of wampum, clothes, and peltry. Colonel
Montgomery, having thus taken vegeance on the per|&s;idious
Cherokees, at the expen&s;e of five or &s;ix men killed
or wounded, returned to Fort Prince George, with about
forty Indian women and children whom he had made pri|&s;oners.
Two of their warriors were &s;et at liberty, and
de&s;ired to inform their nation, that, though they were
now in the power of the Engli&s;h, they might &s;till, on their
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of peace. As the chief,
called Attakullakulla, alias the Little Carpenter, who had
&s;igned the la&s;t treaty, di&s;approved of the proceedings of his
countrymen, and had done many good offices to the Eng|li&s;h
&s;ince the renovation of the war, he was now given to
under&s;tand, that he might come down with &s;ome other
chiefs to treat of an accommodation, which would be
granted to the Cherokees on his account; but that the
negociation mu&s;t be begun in a few days, otherwi&s;e all the
<PB N="206" REF="211">
towns in the Upper Nation would be ravaged, and re|duced
to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The&s;e intimations having produced little or
no effect, Colonel Montgomery re&s;olved to make a &s;econd
irruption into the middle &s;ettlements of the Cherokee$,
and began his march on the twenty-fourth day of June.
On the twenty-&s;eventh Captain Mori&s;on, of the advanced
party, was killed by a &s;hot from a thicket, and the firing
became &s;o trouble&s;ome, that his men gave way. The
grenadiers and light-infantry being detached to &s;u&s;tain
them, continued to advance, notwith&s;tanding the fire from
the woods, until, from a ri&s;ing ground, they di&s;covered
a body of the enemy. The&s;e they immediately attacked,
and obliged to retire into a &s;wamp, which, when the re&s;t
of the troops came up, they were, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance&punc;
compelled to abandon: but as the country was difficult,
and the path extremely narrow, the forces &s;uffered on their
march from the fire of &s;cattered parties, who concealed
them&s;elves behind trees and bu&s;hes. At length they ar|rived
at the town of Etchowee, which the inhabitants had
for&s;aken, after having removed every thing of value. Here,
while the army encamped on a &s;mall plain &s;urrounded by
hills, it was incommoded by vollies from the enemy, which
wounded &s;ome men, and killed &s;everal hor&s;es. They were
even &s;o daring as to attack the piqu$t guard, which re|pul&s;ed
them with difficulty; but, generally &s;peaking,
their parties declined an open engagement. Colonel
Montgomery, &s;en&s;ible that, as many hor&s;es were killed
or di&s;abled, he could not proceed farther without leaving
his provi&s;ions behind, or abandoning the wounded men to
the brutal revenge of a &s;avage enemy, re&s;olved to return,
and began his retreat in the night, that he might be the
le&s;s di&s;turbed by the Indians. Accordingly, he pur&s;ued
his route for two days without interruption; but after|wards
&s;u&s;tained &s;ome &s;tragging fires from the woods,
though the parties of the enemy were put to flight as often
as they appeared. In the beginning of July he arrived at
<PB N="207" REF="212">
Fort Prince George; this expedition having co&s;t him about
&s;eventy men killed and wounded, including five officers.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. In revenge for the&s;e calamities, the Che|rokees
a&s;&s;embled to a con&s;iderable number, and formed
the blockade of Fort Loudoun, a &s;mall fortification near
the confines of Virginia, defended by an incon&s;iderable
garri&s;on, ill &s;upplied with provi&s;ion and nece&s;&s;aries. Af|ter
having &s;u&s;tained a long &s;iege, and being reduced to
the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, Captain Demere, the commander,
held a council of war with the other officers, to deliberate
upon their pre&s;ent &s;ituation; when it appeared that their
provi&s;ions were entirely exhau&s;ted; that they had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
a con&s;iderable time, without bread, upon hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and
&s;uch &s;upplies of pork and beans as the Indian women could
introduce by &s;tealth; that the men were &s;o weakened with
famine and fatigue, that in a little time they would not be
able to do duty; that, for two nights pa&s;t, con&s;iderable
parties had de&s;erted, and &s;ome thrown them&s;elves upon the
mercy of the enemy; that the garri&s;on in general threat|ened
to abandon their officers, and betake them&s;elves to
the woods; and that there was no pro&s;pect of relief, their
communication having been long cut off from all the Bri|ti&s;h
&s;ettlements: for the&s;e rea&s;ons they were unanimou&s;ly
of opinion, that it was impracticable to prolong their de|fence;
that they &s;hould accept of an honourable capi|tulation;
and Captain Stuart &s;hould be &s;ent to treat with
the warriors, and the head men of the Cherokees, about
the conditions of their &s;urrender. This officer being ac|cordingly
di&s;patched with full powers, obtained a capi|tulation
of the Indians, by which the garri&s;on was per|mitted
to retire. The Indians de&s;ired, that when they
arrived at Keowee the Cherokee pri&s;oners confined at that
place &s;hould be relea&s;ed, all ho&s;tilities cea&s;e, a la&s;ting ac|commodation
be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a regulated trade re|vived.
In con&s;equence of this treaty the garri&s;on eva|cuated
the &s;ort, and had marched about fifteen miles on
their return to Carolina, when they were &s;urrounded and
&s;urpri&s;ed by a large body of Indians, who ma&s;&s;acred all
<PB N="208" REF="213">
the officers, except Captain Stuart, and flew five-and-twenty
of the &s;oldiers: the re&s;t were made pri&s;oners, and
di&s;tributed among the different towns and villages of the
nation. Captain Stuart owed his life to the generous
interce&s;&s;ion of the Little Carpenter, who ran&s;omed him
at the price of all he could command, and conducted him
&s;afe to Hol&s;ton River, where he found Major Lewi$ ad|vanced
&s;o far with a body of Virginians. The &s;avages,
encouraged by their &s;ucce&s;s at Fort-Loudoun, undertook
the &s;iege of Ninety-&s;ix, and other &s;mall fortification;
but retired precipitately on the approach of a body of
provincials.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. In the mean time, the Briti&s;h intere&s;t and em|pire
were firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the banks of the Ohio, by
the prudence and conduct of Major-General Stanwix,
who had pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Pitt&s;burgh, formerly Du
Que&s;ne, and employed that time in the mo&s;t effectual man|ner
for the &s;ervice of his country. He repaired the old
works, e&s;tabli&s;hed po&s;ts of communication from the Ohio
to the Monongahela, mounted the ba&s;tions that cover the
i&s;thmus with artillery, erected ca&s;emates, &s;tore-hou&s;es, and
barracks for a numberous garri&s;on, and cultivated with
equal diligence and &s;ucce&s;s the friend&s;hip and alliance of
the Indians. The happy con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures
were &s;oon apparent in the production of a con&s;iderable
trade between the natives and the merchants of Pitt&s;burgh,
and in the perfect &s;ecurity of about four thou&s;and &s;ettlers,
who now returned to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands
from whence they had been driven by the enemy on the
frontiers of Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The incidents of the war were much more
important and deci&s;ive in the more northern parts of this
great continent. The reader will remember that Briga|dier-General-Murray
was left to command the garri&s;on of
Quebeck, amounting to about &s;ix thou&s;and men; that a
&s;trong &s;quadron of &s;hips was &s;tationed at Hallifax, in No|va-Scotia,
under the direction of Lord Colvil, an able and
experienced officer, who had in&s;tructions to revi&s;it Quebeck
<PB N="209" REF="214">
in the beginning of &s;ummer, as &s;oon as the river St. Lau|rence
&s;hould be navigable; and that General Amher&s;t,
the commander in chief of the forces in America, win|tered
in New-York, that he might be at hand to a&s;&s;emble
his troops in the &s;pring, and recommence his operations
for the entire reduction of Canada. General Murray ne|glected
no &s;tep that could be taken by the mo&s;t vigilant
officer for maintaining the important conque&s;t of Quebeck,
and &s;ubduing all the Lower Canada, the inhabitants of
which actually &s;ubmitted, and took the oath of allegiance
to the King of Great-Britain<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The garri&s;on of Quebeck, during the winter, reparied above five hun|dred hou&s;es, which had been damaged by the Engli&s;h cannon, built eight redoubts of wood, rai&s;ed foot-banks along the ramparts, opened embra&s;ures, mounted arti$ler), blocked up all the avenues of the &s;ubu$bs with a &s;tockade, removed eleven months provi&s;ions, into the highe&s;t part to the city, and formed a magazine of four thou&s;and fa&s;cines. Two hundred men were po&s;ted at St. Foix, and twice the number at Lorette. Several hundred men marched to St. Augu&s;tin, brought off the enemy's advanced guard, with a great number of cattle, and di&s;armed the inhabitants. By the&s;e precautions the motions of the French were ob&s;erved, the avenues of Quebeck were covered, and their dominion &s;ecured over eleven pari&s;hes, which furni&s;hed them with &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ion and other nece&s;&s;aries for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Sixteen thou&s;and cords of wood being wanted for the ho&s;pitals, guards, and quarters, and the method of tran&s;porting it from the i&s;le of Orleans being found &s;low and difficult, on account of the floating ice in the river, a &s;ufficient number of hand &s;ledges were made, and two hundred wood-&s;ellers &s;et at work in the fore&s;t of St. Foix, where plenty of fuel was obtained, and brought into the &s;everal regiments by the men that were not upon duty. A detachement or two hundred men, being &s;ent to the other &s;ide of the river, di&s;armed the in|habitants, and compelled them to take the oath of allegiance: by this &s;tep the Engli&s;h became ma&s;ters of the &s;outhern &s;ide of the St. Laurence, and were &s;upplied with good quantities of fre&s;h provi&s;ion. The advanced po&s;ts of the enemy were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Point au Tremble, St. Augu&s;tin, and Le Cal|vaire; the main body of their army quartered between Trois Rivieres, and Jaques Quartier. Their g$neral having formed the de&s;ign of attacking Que|beck in the winter, began to provide &s;now-&s;hoes or rackets, &s;caling-ladders, and falcines, and make all the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for that enterpri&s;e. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Point Levi, where he formed a magazine of provi&s;ions, great part of which, however, &s;ell into the hands of the Engli&s;h; for, as &s;oon as the river was froze over, Brigadier Murray di&s;patched thither two hundred men, at who&s;e approach the enemy abandoned their magazine, and retreated with great precipitation. Here the detachment took po&s;t in a church, until they could build two wooden redoubts, and mount them with artillery. In the mean time, the enemy returning with a greater force to recover the po&s;t, &s;ome battaeliena, with the light infantry, marched over the ice, in order to cut off their communication; but they fled in great confu&s;ion, and after wards took po&s;t at St. Michael, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance further down the river. They now re&s;olved to po&s;tpone the &s;iege of Quebeck, that they might carry it on in a more regular manner. They began to $ig their &s;hip, repair their &s;mall craft, build galleys, ca&s;t bombs and bullets, and prepare fa&s;ines and gabiona; while Brigadier Murray employed his men in making prepara|tions for a vigorous defence. He &s;ent out a detachment, who &s;urpri&s;ed the enemy's po&s;ts at St. Augu&s;tin, Maiton Brul$e, and Le Calvaire, where they took ninety pri&s;oners. He afterwards ordered the light infantry to $word$ and fortify Cape Rouge, to prevent the enemy's landing at that place, a$ well as to be nearer at hand to ob&s;erve their motions; but when the fir&s;t broke up, &s;o that their &s;hips could fall down the river, they landed at St. Augu&s;tin, and the Engli&s;h po&s;ts were abandoned one after another, the de$ tachments retiring without lo&s;s into the city.</NOTE>. The garri&s;on, however,
<PB N="210" REF="215">
within the walls of Quebeck, &s;uffered greatly from the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
cold in the winter, and the want of vegetables and
fre&s;h provi&s;ion, in&s;omuch that, before the end of April,
one thou&s;and &s;oldiers were dead of the &s;curvy, and twice
that number rendered unfit for &s;ervice. Such was the
&s;ituation of the garri&s;on, when Mr. Murray received un|doubted
intelligence that the French commander, the
Chevalier de Levis, was employed in a&s;&s;embling his army,
which had been cantoned in the neighbourhood of Mon|treal;
that from the inhabitants of the country he had
completed his eight battalions, regimented forty companies
of the troops de Colonie, and determined to undertake the
&s;iege of Quebeck, whenever the river St. Laurence &s;hould
be clear of ice, that he could u&s;e his four frigates, and
other ve&s;&s;els, by means of which he was entirely ma&s;ter
of the river.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The brigadier, con&s;idering the city of
Quebeck as no other than a &s;trong cantonment, had pro|jected
a plan of defence, by extending lines, and entrench|ing
his troops on the heighths of Abraham, which, at the
di&s;tance of eight hundred paces, entirely command the
ramparts of the city, and might have been defended by a
&s;mall force again&s;t a formidable army. Fa&s;cines, and
every other nece&s;&s;ary for this work, had been provided, and
in the month of April the men were &s;et at work upon the
projected lines; but the earth was &s;o hardened by the
<PB N="211" REF="216">
fro&s;t, that it was found impracticable to proceed. Being
informed, on the night of the twenty-&s;ixth, that the enemy
had landed at Point au Tremble, to the number of ten
thou&s;and men, with five hundred &s;avages, he ordered all
the bridges over the river Cagrouge to be broke down,
&s;ecured the landing places at Sylleri and the Foulon; and
next day, marching in per&s;on with a &s;trong detachment
and two field-pieces, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous
&s;ituation, and thus defeated the &s;cheme which the French
commander had laid for cutting off the po&s;ts which the
Engli&s;h had e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e being all withdrawn, the
brigadier that &s;ame afternoon marched back to Quebeck,
with little or no lo&s;s, although his rear was harra&s;&s;ed by
the enemy. Here he formed a re&s;olution which hath been
cen&s;ured by &s;ome criticks in war, as a mea&s;ure that &s;a|voured
more of youthful impatience, and overboiling cou|rage,
than of that military di&s;cretion which ought to
di&s;tingui&s;h a commander in &s;uch a delicate &s;ituation; but
it is more ea&s;y to cen&s;ure with an appearance of rea&s;on,
than to act in &s;uch circum&s;tances with any certainty of
&s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Murray, in his letter to the &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, declared, that although the enemy were greatly &s;u|perior
to him in number, yet, when he con&s;idered that the
Engli&s;h forces were habituated to victory, that they were
provided with a fine train of field artillery, that, in &s;hutting
them up at once within the walls, he &s;hould have ri&s;ked
his whole &s;take on the &s;ingle chance of defending a
wretched fortification; a chance which could not be much
le&s;&s;ened by an action in the field, though &s;uch an action
would double the chance of &s;ucce&s;s: for the&s;e rea&s;ons he
determined to hazard a battle; &s;hould the event prove
unpro&s;perous, he re&s;olved to hold out the place to the la&s;t
extremity; then to retreat to the i&s;le of Orleans, or
Coudres, with the remainder of the garri&s;on, and there
wait for a re-enforcement. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e re&s;o|lutions
he gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders over-night, and on the
twenty-eighth day of April, at half an hour after &s;ix in the
morning, marched out with his little army of three thou|&s;and
<PB N="212" REF="217">
men, which he formed on the heighths in order of
batle. The right brigade, commanded by Colonel Bur|ton,
con&s;i&s;ted of the regiments of Amher&s;t, An&s;truther,
Webb, and the &s;econd battalion of Royal Americans: the
left, under Colonel Fra&s;er, was formed of the regiments of
Kennedy, La&s;celles, Town&s;hend, and the Highlanders.
Otway's regiment, and the third battalion of Royal Ame|ricans,
con&s;tituted the corps de re&s;erve. Major Dalling's
corps of light infantry covered the right flank; the left
was &s;ecured by Captain Huzzen's company of rangers,
and one hundred volunteers, under the command of Cap|tain
Donald Macdonald; and each battalion was &s;upplied
with two field-pieces. Brigadier Murray having recon|noitred
the enemy, perceived their van had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the ri&s;ing grounds about three quarters of a mile in his
front; but that their army was on the march in one co|lumn.
Thinking this was the critical moment to attack
them before they were formed, he advanced towards them
with equal order and expedition. They were &s;oon driven
from the heighths, though not without a warm di&s;pute,
during which the body of their army advanced at a round
pace, and formed in columns. Their van con&s;i&s;ted of
ten companies of grenadiers, two of volunteers, and four
hundred &s;avages: eight battalions, formed in four columns,
with &s;ome bodies of Canadians in the intervals, con&s;tituted
their main body: their rear was compo&s;ed of two bat|talions,
and &s;ome Canadians in the flanks; and two thou|&s;and
Canadians formed the re&s;erve. Their whole army
amounted to upwards of twelve thou&s;and men. Major
Dalling, with great gallantry, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their grenadiers
of a hou&s;e and wind mill which they occupied, in order to
cover their left flank; and in this attack the major and
&s;ome of his officers were wounded; neverthele&s;s, the light
infantry pur&s;ued the fugitives to a corps which was formed
to &s;u&s;tain them; then pur&s;uers halted, and di&s;per&s;ed
along the front of the right; a circum&s;tance which pre|vented
that wing from taking advantage of the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion
they had made on the left of the enemy. The
<PB N="213" REF="218">
light infantry being ordered to regain the flank, were, in
attempting this motion, furiou&s;ly charged, and thrown
into di&s;order: then they retired to the rear in &s;uch a
&s;hattered condition, that they could never again be brought
up during the whole action. Otway's regiment was in|&s;tantly
ordered to advance from the body of re&s;erve, and
&s;u&s;tain the right wing, which the enemy twice in vain
attempted to penetrate. Mean while the left brigade of
the Briti&s;h forces did not remain inactive: they had di&s;|po&s;&s;&s;e&s;ed
the French of two redoubts, and &s;u&s;tained with
undaunted re&s;olution the whole efforts of the enemy's
right, until they were fairly fought down, overpowered
by numbers, and reduced to a handful, notwith&s;tanding
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they received from the third battalion of
Royal Americans, which had been &s;tationed with the body
of re&s;erve, as well as from Kennedy's regiment, po&s;ted in
the centre. The French attacked with great impetu|o&s;ity;
and, at length, a fre&s;h column of the regiment
de Rou&s;illon, penetrating the left wing of the Briti&s;h
army, it gave way; the di&s;order was &s;oon communicated
to the right, &s;o that, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, which
la&s;ted an hour and three quarters, Brigadier Murray was
obliged to quit the field, with the lo&s;s of one thou&s;and
men killed or wounded, and the greater part of his artil|lery.
The enemy lo&s;t twice the number of men, and
reaped no e&s;&s;ential advantage from their victory.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. Mr. Murray, far from being di&s;pirited by
his defeat, no &s;ooner retired within the walls of Que|beck,
than he re&s;olved to pro&s;ceute the fortifications of
the place, which had been interrupted by the &s;everity of
the winter; and the &s;oldiers exerted them&s;elves with
incredible alacrity, not only in labouring at the works,
but al&s;o in the defence of the town, before which the
enemy had opened trenches on the very evening of the
battle. Three &s;hips anchored at the Foulon below their
camp; and for &s;everal days they were employed in land|ing
their cannon, mortars, and ammunition. Mean
while they worked ince&s;&s;antly at their trenches before
<PB N="214" REF="219">
the town; and on the eleventh day of May opened one
bomb battery, and three batteries of cannon. Brigadier
Murray made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions to defend the place
to the la&s;t extremity: he rai&s;ed two cavaliers, contrived
&s;ome outworks, and planted the ramparts with one hun|dred
and thirty-two pieces of artillery, dragged thither
mo&s;tly by the &s;oldiery. Though the enemy cannonaded
the place with great vivacity the fir&s;t day, their fire &s;oon
&s;lackened, and their batteries were, in a manner, &s;ilenced
by the &s;uperior fire of the garri&s;on; neverthele&s;s, Quebeck
would in all probability have reverted to its former own|ers,
had a French fleet from Europe got the &s;tart of an
Engli&s;h &s;quadron in &s;ailing up the river.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Lord Colville had &s;ailed from Hallifax,
with the fleet under his command, on the twenty-&s;econd
day of April; but was retarded in his pa&s;&s;age by thick
fogs, contrary winds, and great &s;hoals of ice floating
down the river. Commodore Swanton, who had &s;ailed
from England with a &s;mall re-enforcement, arrived about
the beginning of May at the i&s;le of Bec, in the river St.
Laurence, where, with two &s;hips, he purpo&s;ed to wait
for the re&s;t of his &s;quadron, which had &s;eparated from
him in the pa&s;&s;age: but one of the&s;e, the Lowe&s;toffe,
commanded by Captain Deane, had entered the harbour
of Quebeck on the ninth day of May, and communi|cated
to the governor the joyful news that the &s;quadron
was arrived in the river. Commodore Swanton no
&s;ooner received intimation that Quebeck was be&s;ieged,
than he &s;ailed up the river with all po&s;&s;ible expedition,
and on the fifteenth in the evening anchored above Point
Levi. The brigadier expre&s;&s;ing and earne&s;t de&s;ire that
the French &s;quadron above the town might be removed,
the Commodore ordered Captain Schomberg of the Diana,
and Captain Deane, of the Lowe&s;toffe, to &s;lip their cables
early next morning, and attack the enemy's fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting
of two frigates, two armed &s;hips, and a great
number of &s;maller ve&s;&s;els. They were no &s;ooner in motion
than the French &s;hips fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. One
<PB N="215" REF="220">
of their frigates was driven on the rocks above Cape Dia|monds;
the other ran a&s;hore, and was burned at Point au
Tremble, above ten leagues about the town; and all
the other ve&s;&s;els were taken or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The enemy were &s;o confounded and di&s;pirit|ed
by this di&s;a&s;ter, and the certain information that a
&s;trong Engli&s;h fleet was already in the river St. Lau|rence,
that in the following night they rai&s;ed the &s;iege of
Quebeck, and retreated with great precipitation, leaving
their provi&s;ions, implements, and artillery to Governor
Murray, who had intended to make a vigorous &s;ally in
the morning, and attempt to penetrate into the camp of
the be&s;iegers, which, from the information of pri&s;oners
and de&s;erters, he conceived to be a very practicable &s;cheme.
For this purpo&s;e he had &s;elected a body of troops, who
were already under arms, when a lieutenant, whom he
had &s;ent out with a detachment to amu&s;e the enemy,
came and a&s;&s;ured his that their trenches were abandoned.
He in&s;tantly marched out of Quebeck at the head of his
forces, in hopes of overtaking and making an impre&s;&s;ion on
their rear, that he might have ample revenge for his late
di&s;comfiture; but they had pa&s;&s;ed the river Caprouge be|fore
he could come up with their army; however, he
took &s;ome pri&s;oners, and a great quantity of baggage,
including their tents, &s;tores, magazines of provi&s;ion
and ammunition, with thirty-four pieces of battering can|non,
ten field-pieces, &s;ix mortars, four petards, a great
number of &s;caling-ladders, entrenching tools, and every
other implement for a &s;iege. They retired to Jacques-Quartier,
where their ammunition began to fail, and they
were abandoned by a great part of the Canadians; &s;o that
they re&s;igned all hope of &s;ucceeding again&s;t Quebeck, and
began to take mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of Montreal,
again&s;t which the force under General Amher&s;t was di|rected.
There M. Vaudreuil had fixed his head-quarters,
and there he propo&s;ed to make his la&s;t &s;tand again&s;t the
efforts of the Briti&s;h general. He not only levied forces,
collected magazines, and erected new fortifications in
<PB N="216" REF="221">
the i&s;land of Montreal, but he had even recour&s;e to
feigned intelligence, and other arts of delu&s;ion, to &s;up|port
the &s;pirits of the Canadians and their Indian allies,
which had begun to flag, in con&s;equence of their being
obliged to abandon the &s;iege of Quebeck. It mu&s;t be
owned he acted with all the &s;pirit and fore&s;ight of an ex|perienced
general, determined to exert him&s;elf for the pre|&s;ervation
of the colony, even though very little pro&s;pect
of &s;ucce&s;s remained. His hopes, &s;lender as they were,
depended upon the natural &s;trength of the country, ren|dered
almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by woods, mountains, and mo|ra&s;&s;es,
which might have retarded the progre&s;s of the
Engli&s;h, and protracted the war, until a general paci|fication
could be effected. In the mean time, Major-General
Amher&s;t was diligently employed in taking mea|&s;ures
for the execution of the plan he had projected, in
order to complete the conque&s;t of Canada. He conveyed
in&s;tructions to General Murray, directing him to ad|vance
by water towards Montreal, with all the troops
that could be &s;pared from the garri&s;on of Quebeck. He
detached Colonel Haviland, with a body of troops, from
Crown-point, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;le aux Noix, in
the lake Champlain, and from thence penetrate the &s;hort|e&s;t
way to the bank of the river St. Laurence; while he
him&s;elf, with the main body of the army, amounting to
about ten thou&s;and men, including Indians, &s;hould pro|ceed
from the frontiers of New-York, by the rivers of
the Mohawks and Oneidas, to the lake Ontario, and &s;ail
down the river St. Laurence to the i&s;land of Montreal.
Thus, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that all the&s;e particulars could
be executed, the enemy mu&s;t have been hemmed in, and
entirely &s;urrounded. In pur&s;uance of this plan, General
Amher&s;t had provided two armed &s;loops to crui&s;e in the
lake Ontario, under the command of Captain Loring;
as well as a great number of batteux, or &s;maller ve&s;&s;els,
for the tran&s;portation of the troops, artillery, ammu|nition,
implements, and baggage. Several regiments
were ordered to proceed from Albany to O&s;wego: and
<PB N="217" REF="222">
the general, taking his departure from Schenectady,
with the re&s;t of the forces, in the latter end of June,
arrived at the &s;ame place on the ninth day of July.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Being informed that two French ve&s;&s;els had
appeared off O&s;wego, he di&s;patched &s;ome batteaux to
Ni$gara, with intelligence to Captain Loring, who im|mediately
&s;et &s;ail in que&s;t of them; but they e&s;caped his
pur&s;uit, though they had twice appeared in the neigh|bourhood
of O&s;wego &s;ince the arrival of the general, who
endeavoured to amu&s;e them, by detaching batteaux to dif|ferent
parts of the lake. The army being a&s;&s;embled, and
joined by a con&s;iderable body of Indians, under the com|mand
of Sir William John&s;on, the general detached
Colonel Haldimand, with the light infantry, the grena|diers,
and one battalion of highlanders, to take po&s;t at
the bottom of the lake, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the armed ve&s;&s;els in
finding a pa&s;&s;age to La Galette. On the tenth day of
Augu&s;t the army embarked on board the batteaux and
whale-boats, and proceeded on the lake towards the
mouth of the river St. Laurence. Under&s;tanding that
one of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els had run a-ground and was di&s;|abled,
and that the other lay off La Galette, he re&s;olved
to make the be&s;t of his way down the river to Swegatchie,
and attack the French fort at I&s;le Royale, one of the
mo&s;t important po&s;ts on the river St. Laurence, the
&s;ource of which it in a great mea&s;ure commands. On
the &s;eventeenth the row-gallies fell in with the French
&s;toop commanded by M. de la Broquerie, who &s;urrender|ed
after a warm engagement. Mr. Amher&s;t having de|tached
&s;ome engineers to reconnoitre the coa&s;ts and i&s;lands
in the neighbourhood of I&s;le Royale, he made a di&s;po&s;ition
for the attack of that fortre&s;s, which was accordingly
inve&s;ted, after he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands.
Some of the&s;e the enemy had abandoned with &s;uch preci|pitation,
as to leave behind a few &s;calps they had taken
on the Mohawk river, a number of tools and uten&s;ils,
two &s;wivels, &s;ome barrels of pitch, and a large quantity
of iron. The Indians were &s;o incen&s;ed at &s;ight of the
<PB N="218" REF="223">
&s;calps, that they burned a chapel, and all the hou&s;es of
the enemy. Batteries being rai&s;ed on the neare&s;t i&s;lands,
the fort was cannonaded not only by them, but likewi&s;e
by the armed &s;loops; and a di&s;po&s;ition was made for
giving the a&s;&s;ault, when M. Pouchaut, the governor,
thought proper to beat a parley, and &s;urrender on capitu|lation.
The general having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
fort, found it &s;o well &s;ituated for commanding the lake
Ontario, and the Mohawk river, that he re&s;olved to
maintain it with a garri&s;on, and employed &s;ome days in
repairing the fortifications.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. From this place his navigation down the
river St. Laurence was rendered extremely difficult and
dangerous, by a great number of violent riffs, or rapides,
and falls; among which he lo&s;t above four&s;core men,
forty-&s;ix batteaux, &s;eventeen whale-boats, one row-galley,
with &s;ome artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition. On the &s;ixth
day of September the troops were landed on the i&s;land
of Montreal, without any oppo&s;ition, except from &s;ome
flying parties, which exchanged a few &s;hot, and then fled
with precipitation. That &s;ame day he repaired a bridge
which they had broke down in their retreat, and, after
a march of two leagues, formed his army on a plain before
Montreal, where they lay all night on their arms. Mon|treal
is, in point of importance, the &s;econd place in
Canada, &s;ituated in an i&s;land of the river St. Laurence,
at an equal di&s;tance from Quebeck and the lake Ontario.
Its central &s;ituation rendered it the &s;taple of the Indian
trade; yet the fortifications of it were incon&s;iderable, not
at all adequate to the value of the place. General Am|her&s;t
ordered &s;ome pieces of artillery to be brought up
immediately from the landing-place at La Chine, where
he had left &s;ome regiments for the &s;ecurity of the boats,
and determined to commence the &s;iege in form; but in
the morning of the &s;eventh he received a letter from the
Marquis de Vaudr$uil by two officers, demanding a capitu|lation;
which, after &s;ome letters had pa&s;&s;ed between the
two generals, was granted upon as favourable terms as
<PB N="219" REF="224">
the French had rea&s;on to expect, con&s;idering that Gene|ral
Murray, with the troops from Quebeck, had by this
time landed on the i&s;land; and Colonel Haviland, with
the body under his command, had ju&s;t arrived on the
&s;outh-&s;ide of the river, oppo&s;ite to Montreal: circum|&s;tances
equally favourable and &s;urpri&s;ing, if we reflect
upon the different routes they pur&s;ued, through an ene|my's
country, where they had no intelligence of the mo|tions
of each other. Had any accident retarded the pro|gre&s;s
of General Amher&s;t, the reduction of Montreal
would have been attempted by General Murray, who em|barked
with his troops a$ Quebeck on board of a great
number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, under the command of Captain
Deane, in the Diana. This gentleman, with uncommon
abilities, &s;urmounted the difficulties of an unknown,
dangerous, and intricate navigation; and conducted the
voyage with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that not a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el was lo&s;t
in the expedition. M. de Levis, at the head of his
forces, watched the motions of General Murray, who,
in advancing up the river, publi&s;hed manife&s;toes among
the Canadians, which produced all the effect he could
de&s;ire. Almo&s;t all the pari&s;hes on the &s;outh &s;hore, a far
as the river Sorrel, &s;ubmitted, and took an oath of neu|trality;
and Lord Rollo di&s;armed all the inhabitants of
the north &s;hore, as far as Trois Rivieres, which, though
the capital of a di&s;trict, being no more than an open
village, was taken without re&s;i&s;tance. In a word, Gene|ral
Amher&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Montreal, and thus com|pleted
the conque&s;t of all Canada: a conque&s;t the mo&s;t
important of any that ever the Briti&s;h arms atchieved,
whether we con&s;ider the &s;afety of the Engli&s;h colonies in
North-America, now &s;ecured from inva&s;ion and encroach|ment:
the extent and fertility of the country &s;ubdued;
or the whole Indian commerce thus transferred to the
traders of Great-Britain. The terms of the capitulation
may perhaps be thought rather too favourable, as the
enemy were actually enclo&s;ed, and de&s;titute of all hope
of relief: but little points like the&s;e ought always to be
<PB N="220" REF="225">
&s;acrificed to the con&s;ideration of great objects; and the
fini&s;hing the conque&s;t of a great country without blood|&s;hed
redounds as much to the honour, as it argues the
humanity of General Amher&s;t, who&s;e conduct had been
irreproachable during the whole cour&s;e of the&s;e American
operations. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be allowed he
was extremely fortunate in having &s;ubordinate command|ers
who perfectly corre&s;ponded with his ideas, and a body
of troops whom no labours could di&s;courage, whom no
dangers could di&s;may. Sir William John&s;on, with a
power of authority and in&s;inuation peculiar to him&s;elf,
not only maintained a &s;urpri&s;ing a&s;cendancy over the mo&s;t
ferocious of all the Indian tribes, but kept them within
the bounds of &s;uch &s;alutary re&s;traint, that not one &s;ingle
act of inhumanity was perpetrated by them during the
whole cour&s;e of this expedition. The zeal and conduct
of Brigadier-General Gage: the undaunted &s;pirit and
enterpri&s;ing genius of General Murray; the diligence
and activity of Colonel Haviland; happily co-operated in
promoting this great event.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The French mini&s;try had attempted to &s;uc|cour
Montreal, by equipping a con&s;iderable number of
&s;tore-&s;hips, and &s;ending them out in the &s;pring under con|voy
of a frigate; but as their officers under&s;tood that the
Briti&s;h &s;quadron had &s;ailed up the river St. Laurence
before their arrival, they took &s;helter in the bay of Cha|leurs,
on the coa&s;t of Acadia, where they did not long
remain unmole&s;ted. Captain Byron, who commanded
the &s;hips of war that were left at Loui&s;bourg, having re|ceived
intelligence of them from Brigadier-General Whit|more,
&s;ailed thither with his &s;quadron, and found them at
anchor. The whole fleet con&s;i&s;ted of one frigate, two
large &s;tore&s;hips, and nineteen &s;ail of &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, the
greater part of which had been taken from the merchants
of Great-Britain: all the&s;e were de&s;troyed, together
with two batteries which had been rai&s;ed for their pro|tection.
The French town, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred
hou&s;es, was demoli&s;hed, and the &s;ettlement totally ruined.
<PB N="221" REF="226">
All the French &s;ubjects inhabiting the cerritories from the
bay of Fundy to the banks of the river St. Laurence, and
all the Indians through that tract of country, were now
&s;ubdued, and &s;ubjected to the Engli&s;h government. In
the month of December of the preceding year, the French
coloni&s;ts of Miramichi, Rickebuctou, and other places
lying along the gulf of St. Laurence, made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
by deputies to Colonel Frye, who commanded in Fort
Cumberland at Chignecto. They afterwards renewed
this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t formal manner, by &s;ub&s;cribing
articles, by which they obliged them&s;elves, and the people
they repre&s;ented, to repair in the &s;pring to Bay Verte,
with all their effects and &s;hipping, to be di&s;po&s;ed of ac|cording
to the direction of Colonel Laurence, governour of
Hallifax, in Nova-Scotia. They were accompanied by
two Indian chiefs of the nation of the Mickmacks, a
powerful and numerous people, now become entirely de|pendent
upon his Britannick Maje&s;ty. In a word, by the
conque&s;t of Canada, the Indian fur-trade, in its full
extent, fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h. The
French intere&s;t among the &s;avage tribes, inhabiting an
immen&s;e tract of country, was totally extingui&s;hed; and
their American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hrunk within the limits of
Loui&s;iana, an infant colony on the &s;outh of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi,
which the Briti&s;h arms may at any time ea&s;ily
&s;ubdue.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The conque&s;t of Canada being atchieved,
nothing now remained to be done in North-America,
except the demolition of the fortifications of Loui&s;bourg on
the i&s;land of Cape-Breton; for which purpo&s;e, &s;ome able
engineers had been &s;ent from England with the &s;hips com|manded
by Captain Byron. By means of mines artfully
di&s;po&s;ed and well con&s;tructed, the fortifications were re|duced
to a heap of rubbi&s;h, the glacis was levelled, and the
ditches were filled. All the artillery, ammunition, and
implements of war, were conveyed to Hallifax; but the
barracks were repaired, &s;o as to accommodate three hun|dred
men occa&s;ionally; and the ho&s;pital, with the private
<PB N="222" REF="227">
hou&s;es, were left &s;tanding. The French &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, upon
the continent of America, the fertile country lying on each
&s;ide of the great river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which di&s;embogues it &s;elf
into the gulf of Florida; but the colony was &s;o thinly peo|pled,
and &s;o ill provided, that far from being formidable, it
&s;carce could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, unle&s;s the Briti&s;h traders had been
ba&s;e and treacherous enough to &s;upply it from time to time
with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries. The &s;ame infamous com|merce
was carried on with divers French plantations in the
We&s;t-Indies; in&s;omuch that the governours of provinces,
and commanders of the &s;quadrons &s;tationed in tho&s;e &s;eas,
made formal complaints of it to the mini&s;try. The tempt|ation
of extraordinary profit excited the merchants, not
only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the enemies of their country, but al&s;o to run
all ri&s;ks in eluding the vigilance of the legi&s;lature. The
inhabitants of Martinique found a plentiful market of
provi&s;ion furni&s;hed by the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects at the Dutch
i&s;lands of Eu&s;tatia and Curacoa; and tho&s;e that were
&s;ettled on the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola were &s;upplied in the
&s;ame manner at the Spani&s;h &s;ettlement of Monte-Chri&s;to.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. While the Briti&s;h commanders exerted
them&s;elves by &s;ea and land with the mo&s;t laudable &s;pirit
of vigilance and courage again&s;t the foreign adver&s;aries of
their country, the coloni&s;ts of Jamaica ran the mo&s;t im|minent
hazard of being extirpated by a dome&s;tic enemy.
The negro-&s;laves of that i&s;land, grown in&s;olent in the con|templation
of their own formidable numbers, or by ob|&s;erving
the &s;upine indolence of their ma&s;ters, or &s;timulated
by that appetite for liberty &s;o natural to the mind of man,
began, in the cour&s;e of this year, to entertain thoughts of
&s;haking off the yoke by means of a general in&s;urrection.
A&s;&s;emblies were held, and plans revolved for this pur|po&s;e.
At length they concerted a &s;cheme for ri&s;ing in
arms all at once in different parts of the i&s;land, in order to
ma&s;&s;acre all the white men, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
government. They agreed that this de&s;ign &s;hould be put
in execution immediately after the departure of the fleet for
Europe; but their plan was defeated by their ignorance
<PB N="223" REF="228">
and impatience. Tho&s;e of the con&s;pirators that belonged
to Captain Fore&s;t's e&s;tate, being impelled by the fumes of
intoxication, fell &s;uddenly upon the over&s;eer, while he &s;at
at &s;upper with &s;ome friends, and butchered the whole
company. Being immediately joined by &s;ome of their
confederates, they attacked the neighbouring plantations,
where they repeated the &s;ame barbarities, and &s;ei&s;ing all
the arms and ammunition that fell in their way, began to
grow formidable to the colony. The governour no &s;ooner
received intimation of this di&s;turbance, than he, by pro|clamation,
&s;ubjected the coloni&s;ts to martial law. All
other bu&s;ine&s;s was interrupted, and every man took to his
arms. The regular troops, joined by the troop of militia,
and a con&s;iderable number of volunteers, marched from
Spani&s;h Town to St. Mary's, where the in&s;urrection
began, and &s;kirmi&s;hed with the in&s;urgents: but as they
declined &s;tanding any regular engagement, and tru&s;ted
chiefly to bu&s;h-fighting, the governour employed again&s;t
them the free blacks, commonly known by the name of
the Wild Negroes, now peaceably &s;ettled under the pro|tection
of the government. The&s;e auxiliaries, in con&s;ider|ation
of a price &s;et upon the heads of the rebels, attacked
them in their own way, &s;l$w them by &s;urpri&s;e, until their
&s;trength was broken, and numbers made away with them|&s;elves
in de&s;pair, &s;o that the in&s;urrection was &s;uppo&s;ed to
be quelled about the beginning of May; but in June it
broke out again with redoubled fury, and the rebels were
re-enforced to a very con&s;iderable number. The regular
troops and the militia, joined by a body of &s;ailors, formed
a camp, under the command of Colonel Spragge, who
&s;ent out detachments again&s;t the negroes, a great number of
whom were killed, and &s;ome taken; but the re&s;t, in&s;tead
of &s;ubmitting, took &s;helter in the woods and mountains.
The pri&s;oners being tried, and found guilty of rebellion,
were put to death by a variety of tortures. Some were
hanged, &s;ome beheaded, &s;ome burned, and &s;ome fixed alive
upon gibbets. One of the&s;e la&s;t lived eight days and
eighteen hours, &s;u&s;pended under a vertical &s;un, without
<PB N="224" REF="229">
being refre&s;hed by one drop of water, or receiving any
manner of &s;u&s;tenance. In order to prevent &s;uch in&s;ur|rections
for the future, the ju&s;tices a&s;&s;embled at the &s;e&s;&s;is
of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hed regulations, importing, that no
negro-&s;lave &s;hould be allowed to quit his plantation with|out
a white conductor, or a ticket of leave; that every
negro playing at any &s;ort of game &s;hould be &s;courged
through the publick &s;treets; that every publican &s;uffering
&s;uch gaming in his hou&s;e &s;hould forfeit forty &s;hillings;
that every proprietor &s;uffering his negro to beat a drum,
blow a horn, or make any other noi&s;e in his plantation,
&s;hould be fined ten pounds; and every over&s;eer allow|ing
the&s;e irregularities &s;hould pay half that &s;um, to be
demanded, or di&s;trained for, by any civil or military
officer; that every free negro, or mulatto, &s;hould wear a
blue cro&s;s on his right &s;houlder, on pain of impri&s;onment;
that no mulatto, Indian, or negro, &s;hould hawk or &s;$il
any thing, except fre&s;h fi&s;h and milk, on pain of being
&s;courged; that rum and punch hou&s;es &s;hould be &s;hut up
during divine &s;ervice on Sundays, under the penalty of
twenty &s;hillings; and that tho&s;e who had petit licen&s;es
&s;hould &s;hut up their hou&s;es on other nights at nine
o'clock.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e examples and re|gulations,
a body of rebellious negroes &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in
places that were deemed inacce&s;&s;ible to regular forces,
and from the&s;e they made nocturnal irruptions into the
neare&s;t plantations, where they acted with all the wanton|ne&s;s
of barbarity; &s;o that the people of Jamaica were
obliged to conduct them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t vigilance
and circum&s;pection; while Rear-Admiral Holmes, who
commanded at &s;ea, took every precaution to &s;ecure the
i&s;land from in&s;ult or inva&s;ion. He not only took mea|&s;ures
for the defence of Jamaica, but al&s;o contrived and
executed &s;chem$s for annoying the enemy. Having, in
the month of October, received intelligence that five
French &s;rigates were equipped at Cape Fran$ois, on the
i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, in order to convoy a fleet of merchant
<PB N="225" REF="230">
&s;hips to Europe, he &s;tationed the &s;hips under his com|mand
in &s;uch a manner as was mo&s;t likely to intercept this
fleet; and his di&s;po&s;ition was attended with &s;ucce&s;s. The
enemy &s;ailed from the Cape to the number of eight &s;ail on
the &s;ixteenth, and next day they were cha&s;ed by the King's
&s;hips the Hamp&s;hire, Lively, and Boreas, which, how|ever,
made &s;mall progre&s;s, as there was little wind, and
that variable. In the evening, the breeze fre&s;hened, and
about midnight the Boreas came up with the Sirenne, com|manded
by Commodore M`Cartie. They engaged
with great vivacity for about twenty-five minutes, when
the Sirenne &s;hot a-head, and made the be&s;t of her way.
The Boreas was &s;o damaged in her rigging, that &s;he could
not clo&s;e with the enemy again till next day, at two in the
afternoon, when the action was renewed off the ea&s;t end of
Cuba, and maintained till forty minutes pa&s;t four, when
Mr. M`Cartie &s;truck. In the mean time, the Hamp|&s;hire
and Lively gave chace to the other four French
frigates, which &s;teered to the &s;outhward with all the &s;ail
they could carry, in order to reach the we&s;t end of Tor|tuga,
and &s;helter them&s;elves in Port au Prince. On the
eighteenth the Lively, by the help of her oars, came up
with the Valeur, at half an hour pa&s;t &s;even in the morn|ing;
and after a hot action, which continued an hour and
a half, compelled the enemy to &s;ubmit. The Hamp&s;hire
&s;tood after the other three, and, about four in the after|noon,
ran up between the Duke de Choi&s;eul and the
Prince Edward. The&s;e &s;he engaged at the &s;ame time;
but the fir&s;t, having the advantage of the wind, made her
retreat into Port au Paix; the other ran a&s;hore about two
leagues to leeward, and &s;truck her colours, but at the ap|proach
of the Hamp&s;hire the enemy &s;et her on fire, and
&s;he blew up. This was al&s;o the fate of the Fleur de Lys,
which had run into Fre&s;h-Water-Bay, a little farther to lee|ward
of Port au Prince. Thus, by the prudent di&s;po&s;ition
of Admiral Holmes, and the gallantry of his three cap|tains,
Norbury, Uvedale, and Maitland, two large frigates
of the enemy were taken, and three de&s;troyed. The &s;pirit
<PB N="226" REF="231">
of the officers was happily &s;upported by an uncommon
exertion of courage in the men, who chearfully engaged
in the mo&s;t dangerous enterpri&s;es. Immediately after the
capture of the French frigates, eight of the enemy's pri|vateers
were de&s;troyed or brought into Jamaica. Two of
the&s;e, namely the Vainqueur of ten guns, &s;ixteen &s;wivels,
and ninety men, and the Mackau of &s;ix &s;wivels and fifteen
men, had run into &s;hoal water in Cumberland harbour, on
the i&s;land of Cuba. The boats of the Trent and Boreas,
manned, under the direction of the Lieutenants Millar
and Stuart, being rowed up to the Vainqueur, boarded
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion under a clo&s;e fire, after having &s;ur|mounted
many other difficulties. The Mackau was taken
without any re&s;i&s;tance; then the boats proceeded again&s;t
the Gue&s;pe, of eight guns, and eighty-five men, which lay
at anchor farther up in the Lagoon; but before they came
up the enemy had &s;et her on fire, and &s;he was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The &s;ame activity and re&s;olution di|&s;tingui&s;hed
the captains and officers belonging to the
&s;quadron commanded by Sir James Douglas off the Lee|ward
I&s;land. In the month of September, the Captain$
O'Brien and Taylor, of the &s;hips Temple and Griffin, be|ing
on a joint crui&s;e off the i&s;lands Granadas, received
intelligence that the Virgin, formerly a Briti&s;h &s;loop of
war, which had been taken by the enemy, then lay at
anchor, together with three privateers, under protection
of three forts on the i&s;land, &s;ailed thither in order to attack
them, and their enterpri&s;e was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.
After a warm engagement, which la&s;ted &s;everal hours, the
enemy's batteries were &s;ilenced, and indeed demoli&s;hed,
and the Engli&s;h captains took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the four prizes.
They afterwards entered another harbour of that i&s;land,
having fir&s;t demoli&s;hed another &s;ort; and there they lay
four days unmole&s;ted, at the expiration of which they
carried off three other prizes. In their return to Antigua,
they fell in with thirteen &s;hips bound to Martinique with
provi&s;ions, and took them all without re&s;i&s;tance. About
the &s;ame time, eight or nine privateers were taken by the
<PB N="227" REF="232">
&s;hips which Commodore Sir James Douglas employed in
crui&s;ing round the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, &s;o that the
Briti&s;h commerce in tho&s;e &s;eas flouri&s;hed under his care
and protection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. In the Ea&s;t-Indies the Briti&s;h arms &s;till
continued to pro&s;per. After the reduction of Arcot, the
garri&s;ons of Permacoil and Allumparva &s;urrendered them|&s;elves
pri&s;oners of war in the beginning of May. The
Falmouth obliged the Haarlem, a French &s;hip from Mer|guy,
to run a&s;hore to the northward of Pondicherry. The
important &s;ettlement of Carical was reduced by the &s;ea
and land forces commanded by Rear-Admiral Corni&s;h
and Major Mon&s;on, and the French garri&s;on made pri|&s;oners
of war; and Colonel Coote formed the blockade
of Pondicherry by land, while the harbour was be&s;et by
the Engli&s;h &s;quadron.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. No action of importance was in the
cour&s;e of this year atchieved by the naval force of Great-Britain
in the &s;eas of Europe. A powerful &s;quadron &s;till
remained in the bay of Quiberon, in order to amu&s;e and
employ a body of French forces on that part of the coa&s;t,
and interrupt the navigation of the enemy; though the
principal aim of this armament &s;eems to have been to
watch and detain the few French &s;hips which had run into
the river Villaine, after the defeat of Con&s;tans, an object
the importance of which will doubtle&s;s a&s;toni&s;h po&s;terity.
The fleet employed on this &s;ervice was alternately com|manded
by Admiral Bo&s;cawen and Sir Edward Hawke,
officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, who&s;e talents might have
been &s;urely rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to much greater national
advantages. All that Mr. Bo&s;cawen could do in this
circum&s;cribed &s;cene of action was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
&s;mall i&s;land near the river Vannes, which he cau&s;ed to be
cultivated, and planted with vegetables, for the u&s;e of the
men infected with &s;corbutick di&s;orders ari&s;ing from &s;alt
provi&s;ion, &s;ea air, and want of proper exerci&s;e. In the
month of September, Sir Edward Hawke, who had by
this time relieved Mr. Bo&s;cawen, detached the gallant
<PB N="228" REF="233">
Lord Howe, in the Magnanime, with the &s;hips Prince
Frederick and Bedford, to reduce the little i&s;land of Du|met,
about three miles in length, and two in breadth,
abounding with fre&s;h water. It was defended by a &s;mall
fort, mounted with nine cannon, and manned with one
company of the regiment of Bourbon, who &s;urrendered
in a very &s;hort time after the &s;hips had begun the attack.
By this &s;mall conque&s;t a con&s;iderable expen&s;e was &s;aved
to the nation in the article of tran&s;ports employed to
carry water for the u&s;e of the &s;quadron.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. Admiral Rodney &s;till maintained his for|mer
&s;tation off the coa&s;t of Havre de Grace, to ob&s;erve
what &s;hould pa&s;s at the mouth of the Seine. In the
month of July, while he hovered in this neighbourhood,
five large flat-bottomed boats, laden with cannon and
&s;hot, &s;et &s;ail from Harfleur in the middle of the day, with
their colours flying, as if they had &s;et the Engli&s;h &s;quadron
at defiance, for the walls of Havre de Grace, and even
the adjacent hills, were covered with &s;pectators, a&s;&s;embled
to behold the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure. Having reached the
river of Caen, they &s;tood backwards and forwards upon
the &s;hoals, intending to amu&s;e Admiral Rodney till night,
and then proceed under cover of the darkne&s;s. He per|ceived
their drift, and gave directions to his &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to
be ready, that as &s;oon as day-light failed they &s;hould make
all the &s;ail they could for the mouth of the river Orn$, in
order to cut off the enemy's retreat, while he him&s;elf &s;tood
with the larger &s;hips to the &s;teep coa&s;t of Port Ba&s;&s;in. The
&s;cheme &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. The enemy, &s;eeing their
retreat cut off, ran a&s;hore at Port Ba&s;&s;in, where the Ad|miral
de&s;troyed them, together with the &s;mall fort which
had been erected for the defence of this harbour. Each of
tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els was one hundred feet in length, and capable of
containing four hundred men for a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age. What
their de&s;tination was we cannot pretend to determine; but
the French had provided a great number of the&s;e tran&s;|ports;
for ten e&s;caped into the river Orne leading to
Caen; and in con&s;equence of this di&s;a&s;ter on hundred
<PB N="229" REF="234">
were unloaded, and &s;ent up again to Rouen. This was
not all the damage that the enemy &s;u&s;tained on this part
of the coa&s;t. In the month of November, Captain Ourry,
of the Acteon, cha&s;ed a large privateer, and drove her
a&s;hore between Cape Barfleur and La Hogue, where &s;he
peri&s;hed. The cutters belonging to Admiral Rodney's
&s;quadron &s;coured the coa&s;t towards Dieppe, where a con|&s;iderable
fi&s;hery was carried on, and where they took or
de&s;troyed near forty ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen.
Though the Engli&s;h navy &s;uffered nothing from the
French during this period, it &s;u&s;tained &s;ome damage from
the weather. The Conqueror, a new &s;hip of the line,
was lo&s;t in the channel, on the i&s;land of St. Nicholas, but
the crew and cannon were &s;aved. The Lyme, of twenty
guns, foundered in the Cattegat, in Norway, and fifty of
the men peri&s;hed; and, in the We&s;t-Indies, a tender be|longing
to the Dublin, commanded by Commodore Sir
James Douglas, was lo&s;t in a gale of wind, with an hun|dred
cho&s;en mariners.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Of the dome&s;tick tran&s;actions relating to the
war, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was the equipment of a pow|erful
armament de&s;tined for &s;ome &s;ecret expedition. A
numerous body of forces was a&s;&s;embled, and a great num|ber
of tran&s;ports collected at Port&s;mouth. Generals were
nominated to the command of this enterpri&s;e. The troops
were actually embarked with a great train of artillery;
and the eyes of the whole nation were attentively fixed
upon this armament, which could not have been prepared
without incurring a prodigious expen&s;e. Notwith&s;tand|ing
the&s;e preparations, the whole &s;ummer was &s;pent in
idlene&s;s and inaction; and in the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on
the undertaking was laid a&s;ide. The people did not fail to
clamour again&s;t the inactivity of the &s;ummer, and com|plain,
that, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e &s;ub&s;idies granted
for the pro&s;ecution of the war, no &s;troke of importance
was &s;truck in Europe for the advantage of Great-Britain;
but that her trea&s;ure was lavi&s;hed upon fruitle&s;s parade,
or a German alliance, &s;till more pernicious. It mu&s;t be
<PB N="230" REF="235">
owned, indeed, that no new attempt was made to annoy the
enemy on Briti&s;h principles, for the &s;urrender of Montreal
was the natural con&s;equence of the &s;teps which had been
taken, and of the mea&s;ures concerted in the cour&s;e of the
preceding year. It will be allowed, we apprehend, that
the expen&s;e incurred by the armament at Port&s;mouth, and
the body of troops there detained, would have been &s;uffi|cient,
if properly applied, to reduce the i&s;land of Mau|ritius
in the Indian ocean, Martinique in the We&s;t-Indies,
or Minorca in the Mediterranean, and all the&s;e
three were objects of importance. In all probability, the
de&s;ign of the armament was either to intimidate the French
into propo&s;als of peace, to make a diver&s;ion from the
Rhine, by alarming the coa&s;t of Bretagne, or to throw over
a body of troops into Flanders, to effect a junction with the
Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, who, at the head of
twenty thou&s;and men, had made an irruption as far as the
Lower Rhine, and even cro&s;&s;ed that river; but he mi&s;|carried
in the execution of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e alarms &s;ome regard was
paid to the improvements of natural knowledge. The
Royal Society having made application to the King, re|pre&s;enting
that there would be a tran&s;it of Venus over the
di&s;k of the &s;un, on the &s;ixth day of June, and that there
was rea&s;on to hope the parallax of that planet might be
more accurately determined, by making proper ob&s;erva|tions
of this phaenomenon at the i&s;land of St. Helena,
near the coa&s;t of Africa, and at Bencool$n, in the Ea&s;t-Indies,
his Maje&s;ty granted a &s;um of money to defray the
expen&s;e of &s;ending able a&s;tronomers to tho&s;e two places,
and ordered a &s;hip of war to be equipped for their convey|ance.
Accordingly, Mr. Nevil Ma$kelyne and Mr. Ro|bert
Waddington were appointed to make the ob&s;ervations
at St. Helena; and Mr. Charles Ma&s;on and Mr. J$r$|miah
Dixon undertook the voyage to Bencoolen, on the
i&s;land of Sumatra<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of April, the King granted to his $span$ Edward Augu&s;tus, and to the heirs male of his Royal Highne&s;$, the $word$ of duke of the kingdom of Great-Britain, and of Earl of the kingdom of Ireland, by the names, &s;tiles, and titles of Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ul&s;ter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="236">
&sect; XLII. Except the countries that were actually the
&s;cenes of war, no political revolution or di&s;turbance di&s;|quieted
the general tranquillity. Syria, indeed, felt all the
horrours and wreck of a dreadful earthquake, protracted
in repeated &s;hocks, which began on the thirtieth day of
October, in the neighbourhood of Tripoli. A great
number of hou&s;es were overthrown at Seyde, and many
people buried under the ruins. It was felt through a &s;pace
of ten thou&s;and &s;quare leagues, comprehending the moun|tains
of Libanus and Antilibanus, with an infinite num|ber
of villages, that were reduced to heaps of rubbi&s;h. At
Acra, or Ptolemais, the &s;ea overflowed its banks, and
poured into the &s;treets, though eight feet above the level
of the water. The city of Saphet was entirely de&s;troyed,
and the greate&s;t part of its inhabitants peri&s;hed. At
Dama&s;cus all the minorets were overthrown, and &s;ix thou|&s;and
people lo&s;t their lives. The &s;hocks dimini&s;hed
gradually till the twenty-fifth day of November, when
they were renewed with redoubled havock; the earth
trembled with the mo&s;t dreadful convul&s;ions, and the
greater part of Tripoli was de&s;troyed. Balbeck was en|tirely
ruined; and this was the fate of many other towns
and ca&s;tles; &s;o that the people who e&s;caped the ruins
were obliged to &s;ojourn in the open fields, and all Syria
was threatened with the vengeance of heaven. Such a
dangerous ferment aro&s;e at Conftantinople, that a revo|lution
was apprehended. Mu&s;tapha, the pre&s;ent Empe|rour,
had no &s;ons; but his brother Bajazet, who&s;e life
he had &s;pared, contrary to the maxims of Turki&s;h policy,
produced a &s;on by one of the women with whom he was
indulged in his con&s;inement; a circum&s;tance which
arou&s;ed the jealou&s;y of the Emperour to &s;uch a degree, that
he re&s;olved to di&s;patch his brother. The great officers of
the Porte oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign, which was &s;o di&s;agreeable
to the people, that an in&s;urrection en&s;ued. Several Turks
<PB N="232" REF="237">
and Armenians, taking it for granted that a revolution
was at hand, bought up great quantities of grain; and
a dreadful dearth was the con&s;equence of this monopoly.
The Sultan a&s;&s;embled the troops, quieted the in&s;urgents,
ordered the engro&s;&s;ers of corn to be executed, and in a
little time the repo&s;e of the city was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;pect of a rupture in
Italy, no new incident interrupted the tranquillity which
the &s;outhern parts of Europe enjoyed. The King of
Spain, how&s;oever &s;ollicited by the other branch of the
Hou&s;e of Bourbon to engage in the war, as its ally,
refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e in any other way, than as a mediator
between the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles. He &s;ent
the Conde de Fuentes, a nobleman of high rank and
character, in quality of amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the
King of Great-Britain, in order to offer his good offices
for effecting a peace; and the Conde, after having con|ferred
with the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, made an excur&s;ion to
Paris; but his propo&s;al with re&s;pect to a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;ti|lities,
if in reality &s;uch a propo&s;al was ever made, did
not meet with a cordial reception. Other differences
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the crowns of Great-Britain and Spain
he found no difficulty in compromi&s;ing. His Catholick
Maje&s;ty per&s;i&s;ted in the execution of a plan truely worthy
of a patriot king. In the fir&s;t place, he &s;pared no pains
and application to make him&s;elf thoroughly acquainted
with the &s;tate of his kingdom. He remitted to his people
all they owed the crown, amounting to three &s;core mil|lions
of reals: he demanded an exact account of his fa|ther's
debts, that they might be di&s;charged with the ut|mo&s;t
punctuality: an order was &s;ent to the trea&s;ury,
that ten millions of reals &s;hould be annually appropriated
for this purpo&s;e, until the whole &s;hould be liquidated;
and, to the fir&s;t year's payment, he added fifty millions,
to be divided equally among the legal claimants. He
took mea&s;ures for the vigorous execution of the laws
again&s;t offenders; encouraged indu&s;try; protected com|merce;
and felt the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure of being beloved as
<PB N="233" REF="238">
the father of his people. To give importance to his
crown, and extend his influence among the powers of
Europe, he equipped a powerful &s;quadron of &s;hips at
Carthagena, and is &s;aid to have declared his intention to
employ them again&s;t Algiers, &s;hould the Dey refu&s;e to
relea&s;e the &s;laves of the Spani&s;h nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. Portugal &s;eemed &s;till agitated from the &s;hock
of the late con&s;piracy which was quelled in that king|dom.
The Pope's nuncio was not only forbid the court,
but even &s;ent under a &s;trong guard to the frontiers: an in|dignity
which induced the pontiff to order the Portugue&s;e
mini&s;ter at Rome to evacuate the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dominions.
In the mean time, another embarkation of Je&s;uits was
&s;ent from Li&s;bon to Civita Vecchia; yet the expul&s;ion
of the&s;e fathers did not re&s;tore the internal peace of Portu|gal,
or put an end to the practice of plotting: for, even
&s;ince their departure, &s;ome per&s;ons of rank have been
either committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on, or exiled from the king|dom.
The Je&s;uits were not more fortunate in America;
for in the month of October, in the foregoing year, an
ob&s;tinate battle was fought between the united forces of
Spain and Portugal, and the Indians of Paraguay,
who were under the dominion of the Je&s;uits: victory at
length declared in favour of the two crowns: &s;o that the
vanqui&s;hed were obliged to capitulate, and lay down
their arms. As the court of Portugal had made remon|&s;trances
to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try again&s;t the proceedings of
the Engli&s;h &s;quadron under Admiral Bo&s;cawen, which
had attacked and de&s;troyed &s;ome French &s;hips under the
Portugue&s;e fort in the bay of Lagos, his Britannick
Maje&s;ty thought proper to &s;end the Earl of Kinnoul, as
amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to Li&s;bon, where that noble|man
made &s;uch excu&s;es for the in&s;ult of the Engli&s;h ad|miral,
as entirely removed all mi&s;under&s;tanding between
the two crowns; and could not fail of being agreeable to
the Portugue&s;e monarch, thus re&s;pected, &s;oothed, and depre|cated
by a mighty nation, in the very zenith of power and
pro&s;perity. On the &s;ixth of June, being the birth-day of
<PB N="234" REF="239">
the King of Portugal, the marriage of his brother, Don
Pedro, with the Prince&s;s of Brazil, was celebrated in
the chapel of the palace where the King re&s;ides, to the
univer&s;al joy of the people. The nuptials were announced
to the publick by the di&s;charge of cannon, and celebrated
with illuminations, and all kinds of rejoicing.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. An accident, which happened in the Medi|terranean,
had like to have drawn the indignation of the
Ottoman Porte on the knights of the order of Malta. A
large Turki&s;h &s;hip of the line, mounted with &s;ixty-eight
bra&s;s cannon, having on board a complement of &s;even
hundred men, be&s;ides &s;eventy Chri&s;tian &s;laves, under the
immediate command of the Turki&s;h admiral, had, in
company with two frigates, five gallies, and other &s;maller
ve&s;&s;els, &s;ailed in June from the Dardanelles, crui&s;ed along
the coa&s;ts of Smyrna, Scio, and Trio, and at length
anchored in the channel of Stangie, where the admiral
with four hundred per&s;ons, went on &s;hore, on the nine|teenth
day of September: the Chri&s;tian &s;laves, &s;ei&s;ing this
opportunity, armed them&s;elves with knives, and fell upon
the three hundred that remained with $uch &s;ury and $word$
that a great number of the Turks were in&s;tantly $word$
many leaped overboard into the &s;ea, where they p$ri&s;hed
and the re&s;t &s;ued for mercy. The Chri&s;tians, havingG
thus &s;ecured po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip, hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and $word$
away for Malta; which, though cha&s;ed by the two $word$
gates, and a Ragu&s;an &s;hip, they reached, by crouding a$
their canvas, and brought their prize &s;a$e into the har|bour
of Valette, amid&s;t the acclamations of the $word$
The order of Malta, as a recompen&s;e for this &s;ignal $word$
of bravery and re&s;olution, a&s;&s;igned to the captors the
whole property of the &s;hip and &s;laves, together with al$
the effects on board, including a &s;um of money, which
the Turki&s;h commander had collected by contribution
amounting to a million and a half of $lorins. The $word$
Signor was &s;o enraged at this event, that he di&s;graced $word$
admiral, and threatened to take vengeance on the ord$r$o
<PB N="235" REF="240">
Malta, for having detained the &s;hip, and countenanced
the capture.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. With re&s;pect to the di&s;putes which had &s;o
long embroiled the northern parts of Europe, the neu|tral
powers &s;eemed as aver&s;e as ever to a participation.
The King of Denmark continued to perfect tho&s;e plans
which he had wi&s;ely formed for increa&s;ing the wealth,
and promoting the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects; nor did he
neglect any opportunity of improving natural knowledge,
for the benefit of mankind in general. He employed
men of ability, at his own expen&s;e, to travel into foreign
countries, and to collect the mo&s;t curious productions, for
the advancement of natural hi&s;tory: he encouraged the
liberal and mechanick arts at home, by munificent re|wards
and peculiar protection: he invited above a thou|&s;and
foreigners from Germany to become his &s;ubjects,
and &s;ettle in certain di&s;tricts of Jutland, which had lain
wa&s;te above three centuries; and they forthwith began to
build villages, and cultivate the lands in the dioce&s;es of
Wibourg, Arhous, and Ripen. Their travelling expen&s;es
from Altena to their new &s;ettlement were defrayed by the
King, who, moreover, maintained them until the pro|duce
of the lands could afford a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
He likewi&s;e be&s;towed upon each coloni&s;t a hou&s;e, a barn,
and a &s;table, with a certain number of hor&s;es and cattle.
Finally, this generous patriot having vi&s;ited the&s;e new
&s;ubjects, who received him with un&s;peakable emotions of
joy and affection, he ordered a con&s;iderable &s;um of money
to be di&s;tributed among them, as an additional mark of
his favour. Such conduct in a prince cannot fail to &s;ecure
the warme&s;t returns of loyalty and attachment in his
people; and the execution of &s;uch laudable &s;chemes will
endear his name to the contemplation of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. The Dutch, as u&s;ual, per&s;evered in pro&s;e|cuting
every branch of commerce, without being diverted
to le&s;s profitable &s;chemes of &s;tate policy by the in&s;inu|ations
of France or the remon&s;trances of Great-Britain.
The violation of the peace by their &s;ubjects in Bengal
<PB N="236" REF="241">
was no &s;ooner known at the court of London, than orders
were &s;ent to General Yorke, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at
the Hague, to demand an explanation. He, accord|ingly,
pre&s;ented a memorial to the States-General, &s;igni|fying,
that their High Mightine&s;&s;es mu&s;t, doubtle&s;s, be
greatly a&s;toni&s;hed to hear, by the publick papers, of the
irregularities committed by their &s;ubjects in the Ea&s;t-Indies;
but that they would be much more amazed on
peru&s;ing the piece annexed to his memorial, containing a
minute account, &s;pecified with the &s;tricte&s;t regard to truth,
of the irregular conduct ob&s;erved by the Dutch towards
the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in the river of Bengal, at a time when
the factors and traders of Holland enjoyed all the &s;weets
of peace, and all the advantages of unmole&s;ted commerce;
at a time when his Britannick Maje&s;ty, from his great
regard to their High Mightine&s;&s;es, carefully avoided
giving the lea&s;t umbrage to the &s;ubjects of the United
Provinces. He ob&s;erved, that the King his &s;overeign
was deeply affected by the&s;e outrageous doings and mi&s;|chievous
de&s;igns of the Dutch in the Ea&s;t-Indies, who&s;e
aim was to de&s;troy the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in that coun|try;
an aim that would have been accompli&s;hed, had
not the King's victorious arms brought them to rea&s;on,
and obliged them to &s;ue for an accommodation. He told
them his Maje&s;ty would willingly believe their High
Mightine&s;&s;es had given no order for proceeding to &s;uch ex|tremities,
and that the directors of their India company
had no &s;hare in the tran&s;action: neverthele&s;s, he (the
amba&s;&s;ador) was ordered to demand &s;ignal &s;atisfaction,
in the name of the King his ma&s;ter; that all who &s;hould
be found to have &s;hared in the offence &s;o manife&s;tly tending
to the de&s;truction of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in that coun|try
&s;hould be exemplarily puni&s;hed; and that their High
Mightine&s;&s;es &s;hould confirm the &s;tipulations agreed upon
immediately after the action by the directors of the
re&s;pective companies, in con&s;ideration of which agree|ment
the Dutch &s;hips were re&s;tored, after their com|manders
acknowledged their fault, in owning them&s;elves
<PB N="237" REF="242">
the aggre&s;&s;ors. To this remon&s;trance the States-Gene|ral
replied, that nothing of what was laid to the charge of
their &s;ubjects had yet reached their knowledge; but they
reque&s;ted his Britannick Maje&s;ty to &s;u&s;pend his judge|ment,
until he &s;hould be made perfectly acquainted
with the grounds of tho&s;e di&s;putes; and they promi&s;ed
he &s;hould have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the exemplary
puni&s;hment that would be inflicted upon all who &s;hould
be found concerned in violating the peace between the
two nations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the month of March the States of Holland and We&s;t Frie&s;land having, after warm deba$es, agreed to the propo&s;ed match between the Prince&s;s Carolina, &s;i&s;ter to the Prince of Orange, and the Prince of Na&s;&s;au Weilbourg, the nuptials were &s;olemniaed at the Hague with great magnifi|cence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The war in Germany &s;till raged with unre|lenting
fury, and the mutual rancour of the contending par|ties
&s;eemed to derive fre&s;h force from their mutual di&s;appoint|ments;
at lea&s;t, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;eemed &s;till implacable,
and ob&s;tinately bent upon terminating the war with the
de&s;truction of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. Her allies, however,
&s;eemed le&s;s actuated by the &s;pirit of revenge. The French
King had &s;u&s;tained &s;o much damage and di&s;grace in the
cour&s;e of the war, that his re&s;ources failed, and his
finances fell into di&s;order; he could no longer afford the
&s;ub&s;idies he had promi&s;ed to different powers; while his
&s;ubjects clamoured aloud at the burthen of impo&s;itions,
the ruin of trade, and the repeated di&s;honour entailed
upon the arms of France. The Czarina's zeal for the
alliance was evidently cooled by the irregular and defective
payments of the &s;ub&s;idies &s;he had &s;tipulated. Perhaps
&s;he was di&s;appointed in her hope of conque&s;t, and cha|grined
to &s;ee her armies retire from Germany at the ap|proach
of every winter; and the Briti&s;h mini&s;try did
not fail to exert all their influence to detach her from the
confederacy in which &s;he had embarked. Sweden &s;till
langui&s;hed in an ineffectual parade of ho&s;tilities again&s;t
the hou&s;e of Brandenburgh; but the French intere&s;t began
to lo&s;e ground in the diet of that kingdom. The King
<PB N="238" REF="243">
of Pru&s;&s;ia, how&s;oever exhau&s;ted in the article of men,
betrayed no &s;ymptom of apprehen&s;ion, and made no
advance towards a pacification with his adver&s;aries. He
had employed the winter in recruiting his armies by
every expedient his fertile genius could devi&s;e; in levy|ing
contributions to re-enforce the va&s;t &s;ub&s;idy he re|ceived
from England, in filling magazines, and making
every preparation for a vigorous campaign. In We&s;t|phalia,
the &s;ame fore&s;ight and activity were exerted by
Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, who in the beginning
of &s;ummer found him&s;elf at the head of a very numerous
army, paid by Great-Britain, and &s;trengthened by two-and-twenty
thou&s;and national troops.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. No alteration in the terms of this alliance
was produced by the death of William Landgrave of
He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, who breathed his la&s;t, in an advanced age,
on the twenty-eighth day of January, at Rintelen upon
the We&s;er. He was &s;ucceeded in the landgraviate by his

of the county of Hanau-Mutzenberg, by virtue
of the &s;ettlement made in the life time of her father-in

already &s;een that the King of Spain offered his be&s;t offices
in quality of mediator. When a congre&s;s was propo&s;ed,
the States-General made an offer of Breda, as a place
proper for the negociation. The King of Great-Britain,
by the mouth of his amba&s;&s;ador, thanked their High Mighti|ne&s;&s;es
for the &s;incere de&s;ire they expre&s;&s;ed to put an end to
the ravages of war, which had extended de&s;olation over
the face of Europe: he readily clo&s;ed with their gracious
offer, and in con&s;equence of his high regard and invari|able
friend&s;hip for their High Mightine&s;&s;es, wi&s;hed earn|e&s;tly
that it might be acceptable to the other powers at
war. The French King expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments nearly
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. His amba&s;&s;ador declared, That
his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was highly &s;en&s;ible of the
offer they had made of Breda for holding the congre&s;s;
that, in order to give a fre&s;h proof of his &s;incere de&s;ire to
increa&s;e the good harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and
the States-General, he accepted their offer with plea&s;ure;
but as he could take no &s;tep without the concurrence of
his high allies, he was obliged to wait for their an&s;wer,
which could not fail to be favourable, if nothing remained
to be &s;ettled but the place for holding the congre&s;s.
King Stani&s;laus having written a letter to his Britannick
Maje&s;ty, offering the city of Nancy for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,
he received a civil an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ing the King of Eng|land's
&s;en&s;e of his obliging offer, which, however, he
declined, as a place not conveniently &s;ituated for all the
powers intere&s;ted in the great work of pacification. Civil|$ties
of the &s;ame nature likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;over|eign
of Nancy and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. As the propo&s;als
for an accommodation made by the King of England
and his allies might have left an unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion
of their adver&s;aries had they been altogether declined,
$he court of Vienna was prevailed upon to concur with

<P>&sect; LI. Though the French army under the Mare&s;chal
Duke de Broglio remained in cantonment in the neigh|bourhood
of Friedberg, and Prince Ferdinand had retired
<PB N="241" REF="246">
from Cor&s;dorff to Marpurg, where in the beginning of
January he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters, neverthele&s;s, the
winter was by no means inactive. As far back as the
twenty-fifth day of December the Duke de Broglio, having
called in his detachments, attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the allied
army by a forced march to Klein-linnes; but finding them
prepared to give him a warm reception, nothing but a can|nonade
en&s;ued, and he retreated to his former quarters.
On the twenty-ninth Colonel Luckner, at the head of the
Hanoverian hunters, fell in with a detachment of the
enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred men, under the com|mand
of Count Muret. The&s;e he attacked with &s;uch
vigour, that the count was made pri&s;oner, and all his par|ty
either killed or taken, except two-and-twenty, who
e&s;caped. On the third day of January the Marquis de
Vogue attacked the town of Herborn, which he carried,
and took a &s;mall detachment of the allies, who were po&s;ted
there. At the &s;ame time the Marquis Dauvet made him|&s;elf
ma&s;ter of Dillembourg, the garri&s;on of the allied
troops being obliged to retire into the ca&s;tle, where they
were clo&s;ely be&s;ieged Prince Ferdinand no &s;ooner under|&s;tood
their &s;ituation than he began his march with a &s;trong
detachment for their relief, on the &s;eventh day of the
month, when he attacked and totally defeated the be|&s;iegers,
took &s;even hundred pri&s;oners, including forty
officers, with &s;even pair of colours, and two pieces of can|non.
On that very day the Highlanders, under Major
Keith, &s;upported by the hu&s;&s;ars of Luckner, who com|manded
the whole detachment, attacked the village of
Eybach, where Beaufremont's $word$ of dragoons was
po&s;ted on the &s;ide of Dillembourg, and routed them with
great &s;laughter. The greater part of the regiment was
killed, and many $span$ were taken, together with
two hundred hor&s;es, and all their baggage. The High|landers
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion by their
intrepidity, which was the more remarkable, as they were
no other than raw recruits, ju&s;t arrived from their own
country, and altogether unacquainted with di&s;cipline. On
<PB N="242" REF="247">
the eighth day of January M. de St. Germain advanced
on the left of the allies, with the grenadiers of the French
army, &s;upported by eight battalions, and a body of dra|goons:
but he was encountered by the Duke of Hol&s;tein,
at the head of a &s;trong detachment, in the neighbourhood
of Er&s;dorff, who, by dint of a furious cannonade, obliged
him to retreat with precipitation. After this attempt the
French parties di&s;appeared, and their army retired into
winter-quarters, in and about Franckfort on the Maine;
while Prince Ferdinand quartered the allies at Ca&s;&s;el, Pa|derborn,
Mun&s;ter, and O&s;nabruck, this la&s;t place being
allotted to the Briti&s;h toops, as being the neare&s;t to Emb|den,
where the re-enforcements from Britain were to be
landed. In the beginning of February, the Hereditary
Prince of Brun&s;wick, with the detachment of the allied
army under his command, began his march from Chem|nitz,
in Saxony, for We&s;tphalia, where he &s;afely arrived,
after having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a long conference in Hamelen, with
his father the reigning duke, his uncle Prince Ferdinand,
and &s;ome principal members of the regency of Hanover.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. The French general continued to &s;end out de|tachments
to beat up the quarters of the allies, and lay
their towns under contribution. In the beginning of
March, the Marquis de Blai$ marched at the head of
two thou&s;and four hundred men from Gie&s;&s;en, where he
commanded, to Marpurg, forced the gates of the town,
and compelled the garri&s;on of the allies to take &s;helter in
the ca&s;tle. As he could not pretend to undertake the &s;iege
of the fortre&s;s, by the fire of which he was exceedingly
galled, he demanded of the town a contribution of one
hundred thou&s;and florins, and carried &s;ome of the magi|&s;trates
along with him, as ho&s;tages for the payment of this
impo&s;ition. He afterwards appeared at Hombourg,
Als&s;eldt, and Hartzberg, the frontier po&s;ts of the allies,
but did not think proper to attack either, becau&s;e he per|ceived
that mea&s;ures were taken for his reception. The
French, with all their boa&s;ted politene&s;s and humanity,
are &s;ometimes found as brutal and rapacious as the mo&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="248">
barbarous enemy. On pretence of taking umbrage at the
town of Hanau-Muntzenberg, for having, without their
permi&s;&s;ion, acknowledged the vegency of the landgraviate
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, they, in the month of February, ordered
the magi&s;trates of that place to pay, within the term of
twenty-four hours, the &s;um of &s;even hundred and fifty
thou&s;and livres, on pain of being &s;ubjected to plunder.
This order was &s;ignified by the Prince de Robecq: to
whom the magi&s;trates repre&s;ented the impo&s;&s;ibility of
rai&s;ing &s;uch a &s;um, as the country was totally exhau&s;ted,
and their credit ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, in con&s;equence of
their inability to pay the intere&s;t of the capitals negociated
in the cour&s;e of the preceding year. He &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon
their finding the money before night, they offered to pay
eighty thou&s;and florins, which they rai&s;ed with the utmo&s;t
difficulty, and begged the payment of the re&s;t might be
po&s;tponed for a few weeks: but their reque&s;t was re|jected
with di&s;dain. The garri&s;on was re-enforced by
two battalions, and four &s;quadrons di&s;per&s;ed in the prin|cipal
&s;quares and markets of the city, and the gates were
&s;hut. They even planted cannon in the &s;treets, and tar|red
matches were fixed to many hou&s;es, in order to in|timidate
the inhabitants. The&s;e expedients proving
ineffectual, detachments of grenadiers entered the hou&s;es
of the principal magi&s;trates and merchants, from whence
they removed all their be&s;t effects to the town-hall, where
they were kept in depo&s;it, until they were redeemed with
all the money that could po&s;&s;ibly be rai&s;ed. This exaction,
&s;o little to the honour of a civili&s;ed nation, the French
mini&s;ter declared to the Diet at Rati&s;bon was agreeable
to the in&s;tructions of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. By way of retaliation for the cruelty practi&s;ed at
Hanau, a detachment of the allied army under General
Luckner was &s;ent to rai&s;e contributions in Fulda, and
actually carried off ho&s;tages from that city; but retired
before a &s;trong body of the enemy, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the place. From hence the French marched, in their
turn, to plunder the towns of Hirch feldt and Vacha.
<PB N="244" REF="249">
Accordingly, they appeared at Vacha, &s;ituated on the fron|tiers
of He&s;&s;e, and formed the head of the chain of canton|ments
which the allies had on the Werra. This place
was attacked with &s;uch vigour, that Colonel Freytag,
who commanded the po&s;t, was obliged to abandon the
town; but he maintained him&s;elf on a ri&s;ing ground in
the neighbourhood, where he amu&s;ed the enemy until
two battalions of grenadiers came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus
re-enforced, he pur&s;ued the French for three leagues,
and drove them with con&s;iderable lo&s;s from Gei&s;&s;a, where
they had re&s;olved to fix their quarters. The&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes
happened in the beginning of May, when the grand
armies were ju&s;t in motion to begin the campaign.</P>
<P>&sect; LIV. By this time the forces under the Mare&s;chal
Duke de Broglio were augmented to one hundred thou|&s;and;
while the Count de St. Germain commanded a
&s;eparate army on the Rhine, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and
men, a&s;&s;embled from the quarters of Du&s;&s;eldorp, Cologn,
Cleves, and We&s;el. The &s;econd corps was intended to
divide the allied army, which, by &s;uch a divi&s;on, would
be con&s;iderably weakened; and the French court threat|ened
to form a third army, under the Prince de Soubi&s;e;
but this did not appear. The Duke de Broglio was in
&s;uch high favour with the French mini&s;try at this juncture,
that he was promoted over the heads of many old generals,
who now demanded and obtained their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; and
every &s;tep was taken to render the campaign glorious to
this admired commander: but, notwith&s;tanding all their
care, and his own exertion, he &s;ound it impo&s;&s;ible to take
the &s;ield early in the &s;ea&s;on, from want of forage for his ca|valry.
While his quarters were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Franckfort,
his troops were plentifully &s;upplied with all &s;orts of pre|vi&s;ion
from the Upper Rhine; but this convenience de|pended
upon his being ma&s;ter of the cour&s;e of the river:
but he could not move from this po&s;ition without forfeit|ing
the advantage, and providing magazines for the u&s;e of
his forces, &s;o that he was obliged to lie inactive until he
could have the benefit of green forage in his march. The
<PB N="245" REF="250">
&s;ame inconveniences operated more powerfully on the
&s;ide of Prince Ferdinand, who, being in an exhau&s;ted
country, was obliged to fall back as far as Paderborn,
and draw his &s;upplies from Hamburgh and Bremen on
the Elbe and the We&s;er. By this time, however, he had
received a re-enforcement of Briti&s;h troops from Emb|den,
under the direction of Major-General Griffin; and
before the end of the campaign the forces of that nation
in Germany were augmented to five and-twenty thou|&s;and;
a greater number than had &s;erved at one time
upon the continent for two centuries. The allied army
marched from their cantonments on the fifth day of
May, and proceeded by the way of Paderborn to Fritzlar,
where, on the twentieth, they encamped: but part of
the troops left in the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter, under Ge|neral
Sporcken, were ordered to form a camp at Dulmen,
to make head again&s;t the French corps commanded by
the Count de St. Germain.</P>
<P>&sect; LV. General Imhoff was &s;ent with a detachment to
Kirchavn on the Orme; and General Gil&s;oe, with ano|ther
corps, advanced to the neighbourhood of Hirchfeldt,
on the Fulda. The former of the&s;e having ordered Col.
Luckner to &s;cour the country with a body of hu&s;&s;ars, that
officer, on the twenty-fourth of May, fell in with a French
patrole, which gave the alarm at Butzbach, when the
garri&s;on of that place, amounting to five hundred piquets,
under General Waldener, fled with great precipitation.
Being, however, pur&s;ued, and overtaken near a wood, they
were routed and di&s;per&s;ed. Colonel Luckner, entering
Butzbach, found a con&s;iderable quantity of forage, flour,
wine, and equipage, belonging to the fugitives. What he
could not carry off he di&s;tributed among the poor inha|bitants,
and returned to General Imhoff's camp at
Ameneburg, with above an hundred pri&s;oners. This ex|cur&s;ion
alarmed the enemy to &s;uch a degree, that their
whole army was put in motion; and the Duke de Brog|lio,
in per&s;on, advanced with a $arge body of troops as far
as Friedberg: but under&s;tanding the allies had not
<PB N="246" REF="251">
quitted their camp at Fritzlar, he returned to Franckfort,
after having cantoned that part of his army in the Wet|teraw.
This alarm was not &s;o mortifying as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of the Wirtemberg troops, amounting to ten thou&s;and
men, commanded by their duke in per&s;on, who left the
French army in di&s;gu&s;t, and returned to his own country.
The Imperial army, under the Prince de Deuxponts,
quartered at Bamberg, began their march to Naumberg
on the twentieth of May; but one of their detachments
of cavalry having received a check from a body of Pru&s;&s;ians
near Lutzen, they fell back; and on the fourth day of
June encamped at Lichtenfels, upon the Maine. The
&s;mall detachments of the grand armies, as well as tho&s;e
belonging to the bodies commanded by General Sporeken
and the Count de St. Germain in the neighbourhood of
Du&s;&s;eldorp, &s;kirmi&s;hed with various &s;ucce&s;s. The He|reditary
Prince of Brun&s;wick being detached from the
allied army, with &s;ome battalions of grenadiers, and two
regiments of Engli&s;h dragoons, advanced to the country
of Fulda, where he was joined by the troops under Ge|neral
Gil&s;oe, and atchieved &s;ome incon&s;iderable exploits,
particularly at Ho&s;enfeldt and Zielbach, where he &s;ur|pri&s;ed
and took divers parties of the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; LVI. By the twenty-fourth of June Prince Ferdi|nand,
quitting his &s;ituation at Fritzlar, marched to Fr$l|lendorf,
and encamped on the hills between Ziegenheim
and Frey&s;a, General Imho&s;&s; commanding at a &s;mall di|&s;tance
on the right, and the Hereditary Prince, now re|turned
from Fulda, being po&s;ted on the left of the army.
In the mean time, the Duke de Broglio, a&s;&s;embling his
forces between Merlau and Laubach, advanced to Neu|&s;tadt,
where he encamped on the twenty-eighth day of the
month, and at the &s;ame time occupied a &s;trong po&s;t at
Wa&s;&s;emburg. His intention was to penetrate through
the country of He&s;&s;e into Hanover, and make him&s;elf
entirely ma&s;ter of that electorate. With this view he re|&s;olved
to effect a junction with the Count de St. Germain,
whom he directed to advance towards Brilau and Corbach;
<PB N="247" REF="252">
while he him&s;elf, decamping from Neu&s;tadt on the eighth
day of July, advanced by the way of Franckenberg.
Prince Ferdinand, having received intelligence that the
Count de St. Germain was in motion, began his march
from Ziegenheim, and on the ninth day of July reached
the heighths of Brunau, in the neighbourhood of Wil|dungen.</P>
<P>&sect; LVII. The Hereditary Prince, at the head of the
advanced corps, re-enforced with &s;ome battalions and
&s;quadrons under Major-General Griffin, was &s;ent for|wards
to Saxenhau&s;en, whither the army followed the
next morning. The Hereditary Prince, continuing to
advance, found the enemy already formed at Corbach; but
judging their whole force did not exceed ten thou&s;and in|fantry
and &s;eventeen &s;quadrons, and being impelled by the
impetuo&s;ity of his own courage, he re&s;olved to give them
battle. He accordingly attacked them about two in the
afternoon, and the action became very warm and ob&s;tinate;
but the enemy being continually reinforced with fre&s;h
battalions, and having the advantage of a numerous artil|lery,
all the Prince's efforts were ineffectual. Prince
Ferdinand, being at too great a di&s;tance to &s;u&s;tain him,
&s;ent him an order to rejoin the army, which was by this
time formed at Saxenhau&s;en. He forthwith made di&s;|po&s;itions
for a retreat, which however was attended with
great confu&s;ion. The enemy, ob&s;erving the di&s;order of
the allied troops, plied their artillery with redoubled di|ligence,
while a powerful body of their cavalry charged
with great vivacity. In all likelihood the whole infantry
of the allies would have been cut off, had not the Here|ditary
Prince made a diver&s;ion in their favour, by charging
in per&s;on at the head of the Briti&s;h dragoons, who acted
with their u&s;ual gallantry and effect. This re&s;pite enabled
the infantry to accompli&s;h their retreat to Saxenhau&s;en;
but they lo&s;t above five hundred men, and fifteen pieces of
cannon. General Count Kielman&s;egge, Major-General
Griffin, and Major Hill, of Bland's dragoons, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
them&s;elves by their conduct and intrepidity on this
<PB N="248" REF="253">
occa&s;ion. The Hereditary Prince expo&s;ed his life in the
hotte&s;t part of the action, and received a &s;light wound
in the &s;houlder, which gave him far le&s;s di&s;turbance than
he felt from the chagrin and mortification produced by
his defeat.</P>
<P>&sect; LVIII. Many days, however, did not pa&s;s, before he
found an opportunity of reta$$ating this di&s;grace. Prince
Ferdinand, receiving advice that a body of the enemy,
commanded by Major-General Glaubitz, had advanced
on the left of the allies to Zieg$nheim, detached the Here|ditary
Prince to oppo&s;e them, at the head of &s;ix battalions
of Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians, with Elliot's regiment of
Engli&s;h light hor&s;e, Luckner's hu&s;&s;ars, and two brigades
of cha&s;&s;eurs; on the &s;ixteenth day of the month, he engaged
the enemy near the village of Exdorff, and a very warm
action en&s;ued, in which Elliot's regiment &s;ignalized them|&s;elves
remarkably by repeated charges<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Though this was the fir&s;t time that Elliot's regiment appeared in the field, it performed wonders. They charged five different times, and broke through the enemy at every charge: but the&s;e exploits they did not $word$ without &s;u&s;taining a heavy lo&s;s in officers, men, and hor&s;es.</NOTE>. At length victory
declared for the allies. Five battalions of the enemy, in|cluding
the commander in chief, and the Prince of An|halt
Cothen, were taken, with &s;ix pieces of cannon, all
their arms, baggage, and artillery. During the&s;e tran&s;|actions,
the Mare&s;chal Duke de Broglio remained en|camped
on the heighths of Corbach. He had, in advanc|ing
from Franckfort, left detachments to reduce the
ca&s;tles of Marpourg and Dillembourg, which were occupied
by the allies, and they fell into his hands, the garri&s;ons of
both being obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war. The&s;e
were but incon&s;iderable conque&s;ts; nor did the progre&s;s of
the French general equal the idea which had been formed
of his talents and activity. The Count de St. Germain,
who was his &s;enior officer, and believed by many to be at
lea&s;t his equal in capacity, having now joined his corps to
the grand army, and conceiving di&s;gu&s;t at his being obliged
to &s;erve under the Duke de Broglio, relinqui&s;hed his
<PB N="249" REF="254">
command, in which he was &s;ucceeded by the Chevalier de
Muy. At the &s;ame time, the Marquis de Voyer, and the
Count de Luc, two generals of experience and reputation,
quitted the army, and returned to France, actuated by the
&s;ame motives.</P>
<P>&sect; LIX. The allied army having moved their camp
from Saxenhau&s;en to the village of Kalle, near Ca&s;&s;el,
remained in that &s;ituation till the thirtieth day of July,
when the troops were again put in motion. The Che|valier
de Muy, having pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel at Stadtbergen,
with the re&s;erve of the French army, amounting to thirty-five
thou&s;and men, and extending this body down the
banks of the river, in order to cut off the communication
of the allies with We&s;$phalia; while the Duke de Brog|lio
marched up with his main wing to their camp at Kalle,
and Prince Xavier of Saxony, who commanded their re|&s;erve
on the left, advanced towards Ca&s;&s;el; Prince Fer|dinand,
leaving General Kielman&s;egge with a body of
troops for the defence of this city, decamped in the night of
the thirtieth, and pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel without lo&s;s, between
G$$enau and Dringleberg. The Hereditary Prince, who
had the preceding day pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame river, in order to
re-enforce General Sporcken, who was po&s;ted near Cor|beke,
now reconnoitred the po&s;ition of the enemy, and
found them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very advantageous camp between
Warbourg and Och&s;endor$f. Prince Ferdinand having
re&s;olved to attack them, ordered the Hereditary Prince
and Gen. Sporcken to turn their left, while he him&s;elf ad|vanced
again&s;t their front, with the main body of the
army. The enemy was accordingly attacked, almo&s;t at
the &s;ame in&s;tant, both in flank and in rear, with equal
$mpetuo&s;ity and &s;ucce&s;s. As the in&s;antry of the allied
$rmy could not march fa&s;t enough to charge at the &s;ame
$ime, the Marquis of Granby was ordered to advance with
$he cavalry of the right; and the brigade of Engli&s;h artil|$ery,
commanded by Captain Phillips, made &s;uch expe|dition,
that they were up in time to &s;econd the attack in
$word$ mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing manner. The French cavalry, though
<PB N="250" REF="255">
very numerous, retreated at the approach of the marquis,
except three &s;quadrons, who &s;tood the charge, and were
immediately broken. Then the Engli&s;h hor&s;e fell upon
the enemy's infantry, which &s;uffered greatly, while the
town of Warbourg was a&s;&s;aulted by the Britannick legion.
The French, $inding them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed on both
flanks, as well as in front and rear, retired precipitately,
with con&s;iderable damage, occa&s;ioned chiefly by the Briti&s;h
cannon and dragoons, and many were drowned in attempt|ing
to ford the Dymel. The battalion of Maxwell, and
a brigade under Colonel Beckwith, compo&s;ed of grena|diers
and highlanders, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves remarkably
on this occa&s;ion. The enemy left about fifteen hundred
men, killed or wounded, on the field of battle; with &s;ome
colours, and ten pieces of cannon; and about the &s;ame
number were made pri&s;oners. Mon&s;ieur de Muy lay all
night under arms, on the heighths of Volk-Mi&s;&s;en, from
whence he next day retired towards Wolf$hagen. On the
evening of the battle the Marquis of Granby received
orders to pa&s;s the river in pur&s;uit of them, with twelv$
Briti&s;h battalions, and ten &s;quadrons, and encamped a
Wilda, about four miles from Warbourg, the heighths o$
which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy's grand army<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Copy of a Letter from the</HI> Marquis of Granby, <HI>to the</HI> Earl of Hold$$$ MY LORD,</P>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction that I have the honour of acqua$$ your lord&s;hip of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Hereditary Prince ye&s;terday morning. General Sporcken's corps marched from the camp at Kalle to Lieb$$$ about four in the afternoon of the twenty-ninth; the Hereditary $word$ followed the &s;ame evening, with a body of troops, among which $span$ two Engli&s;h battalions of g$enadiers, the two of H$ghlanders, and four $word$ dro$s of dragoons, Cope's and Conway's. The army was under arms all day on the thirtieth, and, about $word$ at night, marched off in &s;ix columns to $$ebenau. About five the$word$ morning the whole army a&s;&s;embled, and formed on the heighths ne$r $word$ b$ke. The Hereditary Prince was, at this time, m$rching in two colum$ in order to turn the enemy's left flank; which he did by marching to $word$ bou$g, leaving Klein-Eder on his left; and forming in two lines, with left towards Do&s;&s;el, and his $ight near Grimbeck, oppo&s;ite to the left $word$ of the enemy, whole po&s;ition was with the left to the high hill $word$ Offiendorff, and their right to Wa$bourg, into which place they had flung $i&s;cher's corps. The Hereditary Prince immediately attacked the enemy's flank, and, after a very &s;harp di$pute, obliged them to give way, and, by a continued fire, kept forcing them to fall back upon Warbourg. The army was, at this time, marching with the greate&s;t di&s;igence to attack the enemy in front; but the infantry could not get up in time; General Waldegrave, at the head of the Briti&s;h, pre&s;&s;ed their mar$ch as much as po&s;&s;ible: no troops could &s;hew more eagerne&s;s to get up than they &s;hewed. Many of the men, from the heat of the weather, and ever-&s;training them&s;elves to get on through mora&s;&s;y and very difficult ground, &s;uddenly dropped down on their march.</P>
<P>General Mo&s;ty n, who was at the head of the Briti&s;h cavalry that was formed on the right of our infantry on the other &s;ide of a large wood, upon receiving the Duke's orders to come up with the cavalry as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, made &s;o much expedition, bringing them up at a full trot, though the di$$ance was near five m$es, that the Briti&s;h cavalt$y had the happine&s;s to arrive in time to &s;hare the glory of the day, having &s;ucce&s;sfully charged &s;everal times both the ene|my's cavalry and infantry.</P>

<P>Captain Phillips made &s;o much expedition with his cannon, as to have $n opportunity, by a &s;evere cannonade, to oblige tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel, and were formed on the other &s;ide, to retire with the utmo&s;t precipitation</P>

<P>M. de Muy is now retiring from the heighths of Volk-Mi&s;&s;en, where he in under arms la&s;t night, towards Wolf$hagen. I cannot give your lord&s;hip an account of the lo&s;s on either &s;ide.

<PB N="251" REF="256">
this &s;ucce&s;s, Prince Ferdinand was enabled to maintain
his communication with We&s;tphalia, and keep the enemy
at a di&s;tance from the heart of Hanover; but to the&s;e ob|jects
he &s;acrificed the country of Ca&s;&s;el: for Prince Xavier
of Saxony, at the head of a detached body, much more
numerous than that which was left under General Kiel|man&s;egge,
<PB N="252" REF="257">
advanced towards Ca&s;&s;el, and made him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of that city; then he reduced Munden, Gottingen,
and Eimbeck, in the electorate of Hanover. All that
Prince Ferdinand could do, con&s;idering how much he
was out-numbered by the French, was to &s;ecure po&s;ts and
pa&s;&s;es, with a view to retard their progre&s;s, and employ
detachments to harra&s;s and &s;urpri&s;e their advanced parties.
In a few days after the action at Warbourg, General
Luckner repul&s;ed a French detachment, which had ad|vanced
as far as Eimbeck, and &s;urpri&s;ed another at Nord|heim.
At the &s;ame period, Colonel Donap, with a body
of the allied army, attacked a French corps of two thou|&s;and
men, po&s;ted in the wood of Sababourg, to pre&s;erve
the communication between their grand army, and their
troops on the other &s;ide of the We&s;er; and, notwith&s;tand|ing
the &s;trength of their &s;ituation, drove them from their
po&s;t, with the lo&s;s of five hundred men, either killed or
made pri&s;oners; but this advantage was overbalanced by
the reduction of Ziegenheim, garri&s;oned by &s;even hundred
men of the allied army, who, after a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance,
were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>&sect; LX. On the fifth day of Augu&s;t, Prince Ferdinand
being encamped at Buhne, received intelligence that a
con&s;iderable body of the enemy, amounting to upwards
of twenty thou&s;and men, were in motion to make a gene|ral
forage in the neighbourhood of Gei&s;mar. He pa&s;&s;ed
the Dimel early in the morning, with a body of troops,
and &s;ome artillery, and po&s;ted them in &s;uch an advan|tageous
manner, as to render the enemy's attempt totally
ineffectual, although the foragers were covered with
great part of their army. On the &s;ame morning the
Hereditary Prince &s;et out on an expedition to beat up the
quarters of a French detachment. Being informed that
the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphin&egrave;, to the num|ber
of one thou&s;and, hor&s;e and foot, were cantoned at
Zierenberg, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the French camp at
Dierenberg, and pa&s;&s;ed their time in the mo&s;t carele&s;s
&s;ecurity, he advanced towards them from his camp at
<PB N="253" REF="258">
Warbourg, within a league of their cantonment, with|out
&s;eeing any of their po&s;ts, or meeting with any of
their patroles; a circum&s;tance that encouraged him to
beat up their quarters by &s;urpri&s;e: for this &s;ervice he
pitched upon five battalions, with a detachment of High|landers,
and eight regiments of dragoons. Leaving their
tents &s;tanding, they began their march at eight in the
evening, and pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel near Warbourg. About
a league on the other &s;ide of the Dymel, at the village of
Witzen, they were joined by the light troops under
Major Bulow; and now the di&s;po&s;ition was made, both
for entering the town, and &s;ecuring a retreat, in ca&s;e of
being repul&s;ed. When they were within two miles of
Zierenberg, and in &s;ight of the fires of the enemy's grand
guard, the grenadiers of Maxwell, the regiment of
King&s;ley, and the Highlanders, advanced by three &s;epa|rate
roads, and marched in profound &s;ilence: at length,
the noi&s;e of their feet alarmed the French, who began to
fire; then the grenadiers proceeded at a round pace with
unloaded fire locks, pu&s;hed the piquets, &s;lew the guard
at the gate, and ru&s;hing into the town, drove every thing
before them with incredible impetuo&s;ity. The attack
was &s;o &s;udden, and the &s;urpri&s;e &s;o great, that the French
had not time to a&s;&s;emble in any con&s;iderable number; but
they began to fire from the windows, and in &s;o doing,
exa&s;perated the allied troops, who bur&s;ting into the
hou&s;es, &s;laughtered them without mercy. Having re|mained
in the place from two till three in the morning,
they retreated with about four hundred pri&s;oners, in|cluding
forty officers; and brought off two pieces of
artillery. This nocturnal adventure, in which the Bri|ti&s;h
troops di&s;played equal courage and activity, was
atchieved with very little lo&s;s; but, after all, it de&s;erves
no other appellation than that of a partizan exploit,
for it was attended with no &s;ort of advantage to the allied
army.</P>
<P>&sect; LXI. Con&s;idering the &s;uperiority of the French army,
we cannot account for the little progre&s;s made by the
<PB N="254" REF="259">
Duke de Broglio, who, according to our conception,
might either have given battle to the allies with the ut|mo&s;t
probability of &s;ucce&s;s; or penetrated into the heart
of Hanover, the conque&s;t of which &s;eemed to be the prin|cipal
object of the French mini&s;try. In&s;tead of &s;triking
an important &s;troke, he retired from Immenhau&s;en towards
Ca&s;&s;el, where he fortified his camp as if he had thought
him&s;elf in danger of being attacked; and the war was
carried on by &s;mall detachments. Major Bulow, being
&s;ent with a &s;trong party from the camp of the allied army
at Buline, &s;urpri&s;ed the town of Marpurg, de&s;troyed the
French ovens, and brought off a con&s;iderable quantity of
&s;tores and baggage, with &s;ome pri&s;oners. He met with
the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s at Butzbach, where he &s;urpri&s;ed and
took two companies belonging to the regiment of Rau|grave,
and retired with his body to Franckenberg, where
he joined Colonel For&s;en. On the twelfth day of Sep|tember
they made a movement towards Franckenau; and
M. de Stainville, who was po&s;ted with a body of French
troops at Merdenhagen, advanced to check their progre&s;s.
He came up with their rear in the neighbourhood of Mun|den,
and attacked them in pa&s;&s;ing the river Orck with
&s;uch vigour, that For&s;en, with &s;ome of his cavalry, was
taken, and Bulow obliged to abandon &s;ome pieces of can|non.
The action was ju&s;t determined, when this la&s;t
was re-enforced by the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick,
who had made a forced march of five German miles,
which had fatigued the troops to &s;uch a degree, that he de|ferred
his attack till next morning; but, in the mean
time, M. de Stainville retired towards Franckenberg.
The Hanoverian General Wangenheim, at the head of
four battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons, had driven the enemy
from the defiles of Sohcite, and encamped at Lawen|thagen;
but, being attacked by a &s;uperior number, he
was obliged, in his turn, to give way, and his retreat was
not effected without the lo&s;s of two hundred men, and
&s;ome pieces of artillery. When the enemy retired, Ge|neral
Wangenheim repa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and occupied his
<PB N="255" REF="260">
former &s;ituation at U&s;&s;ar. Mean while, General Luck|ner
gained an advantage over a detachment of French
cavalry near Norten. Prince Ferdinand, when Mare&s;|chal
Broglio quitted his camp at Immenhau&s;en, made a
motion of his troops, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters
at Gei&s;mar-wells, the re&s;idence of the Landgrave of
He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; from thence, however, he transferred
them, about the latter end of September, to Ovilgune,
on the We&s;tphalian &s;ide of the Dymel.</P>
<P>&sect; LXII. Such was the po&s;ition of the two oppo&s;ite
grand armies, when the world was &s;urpri&s;ed by an ex|pedition
to the Lower Rhine, made by the Hereditary
Prince of Brun&s;wick. Whether this excur&s;ion was in|tended
to hinder the French from re-enforcing their army
in We&s;tphalia, or to co-operate in the Low Countries
with the armament now ready equipped in the ports of
England; or to gratify the ambition of a young prince,
overboiling with courage, and glowing with the de&s;ire of
conque&s;t; we cannot explain to the &s;atisfaction of the
reader: certain it is, the Au&s;trian Netherlands were,
at this juncture, entirely de&s;titute of troops, except the
French garri&s;ons of O&s;tend and Nieuport, which were
weak and incon&s;iderable. Had ten thou&s;and Engli&s;h
troops been landed on the coa&s;t of Blankenburg, they
might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bruges, Ghent, Bru&s;&s;els,
and Antwerp, without re&s;i&s;tance, and joined the Here|ditary
Prince in the heart of the country: in that ca&s;e
he would have found him&s;elf at the head of thirty thou|&s;and
men, and might have made &s;uch a diver&s;ion in fa|vour
of Hanover, as to transfer the &s;eat of war from
We&s;tphalia into Flanders. The Empre&s;s-Queen might,
indeed, have complained of this inva&s;ion, as the formality
of declaring war again&s;t her had not been ob&s;erved by
Great-Britain; but, con&s;idering that &s;he was the declared
enemy of Hanover, and had violated the barrier treaty,
in e&s;tabli&s;hing which the kingdom of Great-Britain had
lavi&s;hed away &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, a &s;tep of
this kind, we apprehend, might have been taken, with|out
<PB N="256" REF="261">
any imputation of perfidy or inju&s;tice. Whatever
the motives for the prince's expedition might have been,
he certainly quitted the grand army of the allies in the
month of September, and traver&s;ing We&s;tphalia, with
twenty battalions, and as many &s;quadrons, appeared on
the Lower Rhine, marching by Schermbeck and Du&s;&s;el|dorp.
On the twenty-ninth day of the month, he &s;ent a
large detachment over the river at Rocroot, which &s;ur|pri&s;ed
part of the French parti&s;an Fi&s;cher's corps at Rhyn|berg,
and &s;coured the country. Next day, other parties,
cro&s;&s;ing at Rees and Emmerick, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome
redoubts which the French had rai&s;ed along the bank
of the river; and here they found a number of boats, &s;uf|ficient
to tran&s;port the re&s;t of the forces. Then the Prince
advanced to Cleves, and at his approach the French
garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of five hundred men, under the com|mand
of M. de Barral, retired into the ca&s;tle, which,
however, they did not long defend; for on the third day
of October they capitulated, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves
pri&s;oners of war, after having in vain endeavoured to ob|tain
more favourable conditions.</P>
<P>&sect; LXIII. A more important object was We&s;el, which
the prince inve&s;ted, and began to be&s;iege in form. The
approaches were made on the right of the Rhine, while
the Prince in per&s;on remained on the left, to cover the
&s;iege; and kept his communication open with the other
&s;ide, by a bridge above, and another below the place.
He had hoped to carry it by a vigorous ex$$tion, without the formality of a regular &s;iege, but he met with a warmer
reception than he expected, and his operations were re|tarded
by heavy rains, which, by &s;welling the river, en|dangered
his bridges and laid his trenches under water.
The difficulties and delays occa&s;ioned by this circum&s;tance
entirely fru&s;trated his de&s;ign. The French, being made
acquainted with his motions, were not &s;low in taking
mea&s;ures to anticipate his &s;ucce&s;s. M. de Ca&s;tries was
detached after him with thirty battalions, and thirty-eight
&s;quadrons; and, by forced marches, arrived on the
<PB N="257" REF="262">
fourteenth day of October, at Rhynberg, where the
prince's light troops were po&s;ted. The&s;e he attacked im|mediately,
and compelled to abandon the po&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding
all the efforts of the Prince, who commanded in
per&s;on, and appeared in the warme&s;t parts of this &s;hort,
but &s;anguinary affair. The enemy, leaving five batta|lions,
with &s;ome &s;quadrons, at Rhynberg, marched by
the left, and encamped behind the convent of Campen.
The Prince, having received intimation that M. de
Ca&s;tries was not yet joined by &s;ome re-enforcements that
were on the march, determined to be beforehand with
them, and attempt that very night to &s;urpri&s;e him
in his camp. For this purpo&s;e he began his march at
ten in the evening, after having left four battalions,
and five &s;quadrons, under General Bo$k, with in|&s;tructions
to ob&s;erve Rhynberg, and attack that po&s;t,
in ca&s;e the attempt on Campen &s;hould &s;ucceed. Be|fore
the allied forces could reach the enemy's camp,
they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of overpowering Fi&s;cher's
corps of irregulars, which occupied the convent of Cam|pen,
at the di&s;tance of half a league in their front. This
&s;ervice occa&s;ioned &s;ome firing, the noi&s;e of which alarmed
the French army. Their commander formed them with
great expedition, and po&s;ted them in a wood, where
they were immediately attacked, and at fir&s;t obliged to
give ground; but they &s;oon retrieved all they had lo&s;t,
and &s;u&s;tained without flinching an uncea&s;ing fire of mu&s;|quetry,
from five in the morning till nine at night, when
they reaped the fruits of their per&s;everance. The Here|ditary
Prince, who&s;e hor&s;e was killed under him, &s;eeing
no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in prolonging an action which
had already co&s;t him a con&s;iderable number of men,
thought proper to give orders for a retreat, which was not
effected without confu&s;ion, and left the field of battle to
the enemy. His lo&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, did not fall &s;hort of
&s;ixteen hundred choice men, killed, wounded, and taken;
and this lo&s;s fell chiefly on the troops of Great-Britain,
who were always found in the foremo&s;t ranks of danger.
<PB N="258" REF="263">
All the officers, both of infantry and dragoons, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
them&s;elves remarkably, and many were dange|rou&s;ly
wounded. Among the&s;e, the nation regretted the
lo&s;s of Lord Downe, who&s;e wounds proved mortal: he
was a young nobleman of &s;pirit, who had lately embraced
a military life, though he was not regularly trained in the
&s;ervice.</P>
<P>LXIV. Next day, which was the &s;ixteenth of Octo|ber,
the enemy attacked an advanced body of the allies,
which was po&s;ted in a wood before Elverick, and extended
along the Rhine. The firing of cannon and mu&s;quetry
was maintained till night. Mean while, a column of the
French infantry, commanded by M. de Chabot, marched
through Walach, and took po&s;t among the thickets, at
the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league, in the front of the
Prince's army. By this time the Rhine was &s;o much
&s;welled by the rains, and the banks of it were overflowed
in &s;uch a manner, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to repair and
move lower down the bridge which had been thrown
over that river. This work was accordingly performed
in pre&s;ence of the enemy, and the Prince, pa&s;&s;ing with|out
mole&s;tation, proceeded to Bruynen, where he fixed
his head-quarters. His pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine &s;o ea&s;ily, under
the eye of a victorious army, &s;o much &s;uperior to him in
number, may be counted among the fortunate incidents
of his life. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of an expedition, which
expo&s;ed the projector of it to the imputation of temerity.
Whatever his aim might have been, be&s;ides the reduction
of We&s;el, with the &s;trength of which he did not &s;eem
to have been very well acquainted, he certainly mi&s;|carried
in his de&s;ign, and his mi&s;carriage was attended
with a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s of troops, occa&s;ioned not
only by the action, but al&s;o by the di&s;ea&s;es engendered
from the wet weather, the fatigue of long marches, and
the want of proper conveniences, not to mention the
enormous expen&s;e in contingencies, incurred by this fruit|le&s;s
undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="264">
&sect; LXV. In the month of November, while he lay
encamped in the neighbourhood of Schermbeck, a body
of the enemy attempted to beat up his quarters: having re|ceived
intimation of their de&s;ign, he immediately called
in his advanced po&s;ts, and made a di&s;po&s;ition for giving
them a proper reception. He abandoned the tents that
were in the front of his camp, and po&s;ted his infantry in
ambu&s;cade behind tho&s;e that were in the rear: at the &s;ame
time he ordered &s;ome regiments of hor&s;e and hu&s;&s;ars to
fetch a compa&s;s, and fall upon the back of the enemy.
This &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. The French de|tachment,
believing the allies had actually abandoned
their camp, began to pillage the tents in the utmo&s;t di&s;|order:
then the infantry &s;allied from the place where
they were concealed, and fell upon them with great im|petuo&s;ity:
the artillery opened, and the cavalry charged
them in flank. In a word, of twelve hundred who march|ed
from We&s;el on this expedition, &s;carce two hundred
e&s;caped.</P>
<P>&sect; LXVI. The Duke de Broglio endeavoured, by &s;un|dry
means, to take advantage of the allied army on the
other &s;ide to the We&s;er, thus weakened by the ab&s;ence of
the troops under the Hereditary Prince; but he found
Prince Ferdinand too vigilant to be &s;urpri&s;ed, and too
&s;trongly &s;ituated to be attacked with any pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s.
He, therefore, contented him&s;elf with ravaging
the country by detachments: he &s;ent M. de Stainville,
with a con&s;iderable body of $orces, to penetrate into the
heart of Hanover; and on the fifteenth day of September,
that officer falling in with a detachment of the allies,
commanded by Major Bulow, attacked them near the
abbey of Schaken. After a warm and ob&s;tinate engage|ment,
they were defeated, and driven to Bulemont, with
the lo&s;s of their cannon, baggage, and a good number of
men, who fell into the hands of the victors. After this
exploit, M. de Stainville advanced to Halber&s;tadt, and
demanded of that capital a contribution of one million
five hundred thou&s;and livres: but the citizens had been
<PB N="260" REF="265">
&s;o drained by former exactions, that they could not rai&s;e
above thirty thou&s;and: for the remainder the French
partizan took ho&s;tages, with whom he returned to the
grand army encamped at Ca&s;&s;el, from whence they, in a
little time, fell back as far as Gottingen.</P>
<P>&sect; LXVII. As the enemy retreated Prince Ferdinand
advanced as far as Hur&s;te, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters
about the latter end of November. While he
remained in this po&s;ition, divers &s;kirmi&s;hes happened in
the neighbourhood of Gottingen. Major-General Brei|denbach,
at the head of two regiments of Hanoverian
and Brun&s;wick guards, with a detachment of cavalry,
attacked, on the twenty-ninth day of November, the
French po&s;t at Heydemunden, upon the river Worrau.
This he carried, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, which
the enemy ha&s;tily abandoned. Part of their detachment
cro&s;&s;ed the river in boats; the re&s;t threw them&s;elves into
an entrenchment that covered the pa&s;&s;age, which the allies
endeavoured to force in &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts,
galled as they were by the fire of the enemy's redoubts on
the other &s;ide of the river. At length M. Breidenbach
was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and fall back into the town, from
whence he retired at midnight, after having &s;u&s;tained con|&s;iderable
damage. Prince Ferdinand had it very much at
heart to drive the French from Gottingen, and accord|ingly
inve&s;ted that city; but the French garri&s;on, which
was numerous, and well provided, made &s;uch a vigorous
defence, as baffled all the endeavours of the allies, who
were moreover impeded by the rainy weather, which,
added to other con&s;iderations, prevented them from un|dertaking
the &s;iege in form. Neverthele&s;s, they kept the
place blocked up from the twenty-&s;econd day of Novem|ber
to the twelfth of the following month, when the gar|ri&s;on,
in a de&s;perate &s;ally, took one of their principal po&s;ts,
and compelled them to rai&s;e the blockade. About the
middle of December, Prince Ferdinand retired into win|ter-quarters,
he him&s;elf re&s;iding at U&s;lar, and the Engli&s;h
troops being cantoned in the bi&s;hoprick of Paderborn.
<PB N="261" REF="266">
Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIII. 1760.</NOTE> the enemy were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of He&s;&s;e, and the
whole country ea&s;tward of the We&s;er, to the frontiers of
the electorate of Hanover. If the allied army had not
been weakened, for the &s;ake of a ra&s;h, ill-concerted,
and un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition to the Lower-Rhine, in all
probability the French would have been obliged to abandon
the footing they had gained in the cour&s;e of this campaign,
and in particular to retreat from Gottingen, which they
now maintained and fortified with great diligence and cir|cum&s;pection.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after all his labours, not|with&s;tanding
the great talents he had di&s;played,
and the incredible efforts he had made, &s;till found him&s;elf
&s;urrounded by his enemies, and in danger of being cru&s;hed,
by their clo&s;ing, and contracting their circle. Even the
Swedes, who had langui&s;hed &s;o long, &s;eemed to be rou&s;ed
to exertion in Pomerania, during the &s;everity of the winter
<PB N="263" REF="268">
&s;ea&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV. 1760.</NOTE> The Pru&s;&s;ian general, Manteuffel, had, on the
twentieth day of January, pa&s;&s;ed the river Peene, over|thrown
the advanced po&s;ts of the enemy at Ziethen, and
penetrated as far as the neighbourhood of Grie&s;&s;ewalde;
but finding the Swedes on their guard, he returned to
Anclam, where his head-quarters were e&s;tabli&s;hed. This
in&s;ult was &s;oon retaliated with intere&s;t. On the twenty-eighth
day of the month, at five in the morning, a body of
Swedes attacked the Pru&s;&s;ian troops po&s;ted in the &s;uburbs
of Anclam, on the other &s;ide of the Peene, and drove them
into the city, which they entered pell-mell. General
Manteuffel, being alarmed, endeavoured to rally the
troops, but was wounded and taken, with about two hun|dred
men, and three pieces of cannon. The victors, hav|ing
atchieved this exploit, returned to their own quarters.
As for the Ru&s;&s;ian army, which had wintered on the
other &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula, the &s;ea&s;on was pretty far advanced
before it could take the field; though General Tottleben
was detached from it, about the beginning of June, at the
head of ten thou&s;and Co&s;&s;acks, and other light troops, with
which he made an irruption into Pomerania, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
his head-quarters at Belgard.</P>
<P>&sect; II. At the beginning of the campaign the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia's chief aim was to take mea&s;ures for the pre&s;erva|tion
of Sile&s;ia, the conque&s;t of which &s;eemed to be the
principal object with the court of Vienna. While the
Au&s;trian army, under Mare&s;chal Count Daun, lay &s;trong|ly
entrenched in the neighbourhood of Dre&s;den, the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia had endeavoured, in the month of December,
to make him quit that advantageous &s;ituation, by cutting
off his provi&s;ions, and making an irruption into Bohemia.
For th$&s;e purpo&s;es he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dippe&s;walde,
Maxen, and Pretchendor&s;&s;, as if he intended to enter Bo|hemia
by the way of Pa&s;sberg: but this &s;cheme being
found impracticable, he returned to his camp at Freyberg;
and in January the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies were
cantoned &s;o near each other, that daily &s;kirmi&s;hes were
fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. The head of the Pru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="264" REF="269">
camp was formed by a body of four thou&s;and men under
Gen. Zettwitz, who, on the twenty-ninth day of January,
was attacked with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity by the Au&s;trian gene|ral,
Beck, that he retreated in great confu&s;ion to Torgau,
with the lo&s;s of five hundred men, eight pieces of artille|ry,
and a con&s;iderable quantity of new clothing, and
other baggage. Another advantage of the &s;ame nature
was gained by the Au&s;trians at Neu&s;tadt over a &s;mall body
of Pru&s;&s;ians who occupied that city. In the month of
March General Laudohn advanced with a &s;trong detach|ment
of hor&s;e and foot, in order to &s;urpri&s;e the Pru&s;&s;ians,
who, in attempting to effect a retreat to Steinau, were
&s;urrounded accordingly, and very roughly handled. Gene|ral
Laudohn &s;ummoned them twice by &s;ound of trumpet
to lay down their arms; but their commanders, the Cap|tains
Blumenthal and Zettwitz, rejecting the propo&s;al
with di&s;dain, the enemy attacked them on all hands with
a great &s;uperiority of number. In this emergency the
Pru&s;&s;ian captains formed their troops into a &s;quare, and
by a clo&s;e continued fire kept the enemy at bay; until
perceiving that the Croats had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wood
between Siebenhau&s;en and Steinau, they, in apprehen&s;ion
of being intercepted, abandoned their baggage, and
forced their way to Steinau, which they reached with
great difficulty, having been continually harra&s;&s;ed by the
Au&s;trians, who paid dear for this advantage. Several
other petty exploits of this kind were atchieved by detach|ments
on both &s;ides, before the campaign was begun by
the grand armies.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Towards the end of April the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
altered his po&s;ition, and withdrew that part of his chain
of cantonments extending from the fore&s;t of Thurundt
to the right of the Elbe. He now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
very &s;trong camp between the Elbe and the Mulda, which
he entrenched in every part that was acce&s;&s;ible, and forti|fied
with two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon. By
the&s;e precautions he was enabled to keep his ground
again&s;t the army of Count Daun, and at the &s;ame time
<PB N="265" REF="270">
detach a body of troops, as a re-enforcement to his brother
Prince Henry, who a&s;&s;embled a &s;eparate army near Franck|fort
upon the Oder, that he might be at hand either to
oppo&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ians, or march to the relief of Sile&s;ia,
which the enemy was bent upon invading. It was for
this purpo&s;e that the Au&s;trian general, Laudohn, advan|ced
with a con&s;iderable army into Lu&s;atia about the be|ginning
of May, and General Beck, with another body
of troops, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cotbus: mean while Count
Daun continued in his old &s;ituation on the Elbe; Gene|ral
Lacy formed a &s;mall detached army upon the frontiers
of Saxony, to the &s;outhward of Dre&s;den; and the
Prince de Deuxponts marched into the &s;ame neighbour|hood
with the army of the Empire. Prince Henry of
Pru&s;&s;ia, having encamped with his army for &s;ome time at
Sagan, in Sile&s;ia, moved from thence to Gorlitz in Lu|&s;atia,
to ob&s;erve the motions of General Laudohn, en|camped
at Konin&s;gratz; from whence, in the beginning
of June, he marched into the country of Glatz, and ad|vanced
to the neighbourhood of Schweidnitz, which he
&s;eemed determined to be&s;iege, having a train of eight
pieces of cannon. With a view to thwart his de&s;igns,
Prince Henry re-enforced the body of troops under
General Fouquet; and at the &s;ame time he &s;ent a detach|ment
into Pomerania, under Colonel Le&s;&s;ow, who de|$eated
the rear-guard of General Tottleben, and com|pelled
that officer to evacuate Pomerania. By this time,
however, Mare&s;chal Soltikoff had arrived from Peter&s;|burgh,
and taken the command of the grand Ru&s;&s;ian
army, which pa&s;&s;ed the Vi&s;tula in June, and began its
march towards the frontiers of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. In the month of June General Laudohn made
an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to carry Glatz by a&s;&s;ault: but he
&s;ucceeded better in his next enterpri&s;e. Under&s;tanding
that General Fouquet, who occupied the po&s;t at Land|&s;hut,
had weakened him&s;elf by &s;ending off detachments
under the Major-Generals Ziethen and Grant, he re&s;olved
to attack him with &s;uch a &s;uperiority of number, that he
<PB N="266" REF="271">
&s;hould not be able to re&s;i&s;t. Accordingly, on the twenty-third
day of June, at two in the morning, he began the
a&s;&s;ault with his whole army upon &s;ome redoubts which
Fouquet occupied, and the&s;e were carried one after ano|ther,
though not without a very de&s;perate oppo&s;ition.
General Fouquet being &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, refu&s;ed
to &s;ubmit; and having received two wounds, was at
length taken pri&s;oner: about three thou&s;and of his m$n
e&s;caped to Bre&s;lau; the re&s;t were killed or taken; but the lo$
of the victors is &s;aid to have exceeded that of the vanqui&s;hed.
In July General Laudohn undertook the &s;iege of Glatz,
which was taken after a very faint re&s;i&s;tance: for, on the
very day the batteries were opened again&s;t the place, the
garri&s;on abandoned part of the fortifications, which the
be&s;iegers immediately occupied. The Pru&s;&s;ians made re|peated
efforts to regain the ground they had lo&s;t; but they
were repul&s;ed in all their attempts. At length the garri|&s;on
laid down their arms, and &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.
From this tame behaviour of the Pru&s;&s;ians, one would
imagine the garri&s;on mu&s;t have been very weak, a circum|&s;tance
which we cannot reconcile with the known &s;agacity
of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, as the place was of great im|portance,
on account of the immen&s;e magazine it con|tained,
including above one hundred bra&s;s cannon, a great
number of mortars, and a va&s;t quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Laudohn, encouraged by his &s;ucce&s;s at Glatz,
advanced immediately to Bre&s;lau, which he began to
bombard with great fury<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Germans are in general but indifferent engineers, and little ac|quainted with the art of be&s;ieging. On this occa&s;ion the Au&s;trian General had no other pro&s;pect than that of carrying the place by a &s;udden attack, or intimidating Count Tavenzein, the governor, to an immediate &s;u$$$$ for he knew the Ru&s;&s;ian army was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and $word$ from the character of Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, that he would advan$$$ $word$ the relief of the place long before it could be taken according to the $word$ forms. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, when he had inve&s;ted the town, he &s;ent a letter to the governor, &s;pecifying, that his army con&s;i&s;ted of $word$ battalions and four&s;core &s;quadrons; that the Ru&s;&s;ian army, amounting to &s;eventy-five thou&s;and men, was within three days march of B$$&s;lau; that no &s;uccour could be expected from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, encamped as he was on the other &s;ide of the Elbe, and over-awed by the army of Count Daun; that Prince Henry, far from being in a condition to bring relief, would not be able to &s;tand his ground again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians; that $word$ being an open mercantile town, not a fortre&s;s, could not be de$ended without con|travening the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of war; and therefore the governor, in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, had no rea&s;on to expect an honourable capitua$$n, the benefit of which was now offered. He, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent a memorial to the e$il magi&s;trates, threatening their town with de&s;truction, which could by no other means be prevented than by joining with the inhabitants in per&s;uading the governor to embrace immediately the terms that were propo&s;ed. Count Tavenzein, in&s;tead of being intimidated, was encouraged by the&s;e menaces, which implied an apprehen&s;ion in Laudohn that the place would be relieved. He, therefore, replied to the &s;ummons he had received, that Bre&s;lau was not &s;imply a mercantile town, but ought to be con&s;idered as a place of &s;trength, as being &s;urrounded with works and wet ditches; that the Au&s;trians them|&s;elves had defended it as &s;uch after the battle of Li&s;&s;a, in the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even; that the King his ma&s;ter having com|manded him to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity, he could neither com|ply with General La$dohn's propo&s;als, nor pay the lea&s;t regard to his threats of de&s;troying the town, as he had not been entru&s;ted with the care of the hou&s;es, but with the defence of the fortification. The Au&s;trian con|vinced him that &s;ame evening, that he threatened nothing but what he me$nt to perform. He opened his batteries, and poured in upon the town a mo&s;t terrible &s;hower of bombs and red-hot bullets, which continued till midnight. During this dreadful di&s;charge, which &s;ided the place with hor|rour and de&s;olation, he attempted the out works by a&s;&s;ault. The Croats at|tacked the covered way in different places with their u&s;ual in petuo&s;ity; but were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo$s, by the conduct and re&s;olution of the governor and ga$$i&s;on. The&s;e proceedings having made no impre&s;&s;ion on Taven$ in, the be&s;ieging general had $word$ again to negociation, and offered the mo&s;t flatterin$ articles of capitulation, which were rejected with di&s;dain. The governor gave him to under&s;tand, that the de&s;truction of the town had made no change in his re&s;loution, though it was a practice con|trary to the law of arms, as well as to the dictates of common humanity, to begin the &s;iege of a $word$ by ruining the inhabitants: finally, he a&s;&s;ured him he would wait for him upon the ramp$$$, and defend the $word$ to the utmo&s;t of his power. His ob&s;ervations were certainly ju&s;t: $word$ could $word$ more infamou&s;ly inhuman than this practice of making war upon the help|le&s;s unarmed inhabitants of a town which has the misfortune to be be|leaguered; yet the be&s;ieger pleaded the example of the Pru&s;$ian monarch, who had before acted the &s;ame tragedy at Dre&s;den. Laudohn being thus &s;et at de$iance, continued to batter and bombard, and &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;aults were given to the fortifications.</NOTE>; but, before he could make a
<PB N="267" REF="272">
regular attack, he found him&s;elf obliged to retire. Prince
Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed generals
which this a geproduced, having received repeated intelligence
<PB N="268" REF="273">
that the Ru&s;&s;ian army intended to join Laudohn at Bre&s;&s;au, re&s;olved to advance, and give them battle before the pur|po&s;ed
junction. In the latter end of July he began his
march from Glei&s;&s;en, and on the la&s;t day of that month
had reached Linden, near Slauve, where he under&s;tood that
Tottleben's detachment only had pa&s;&s;ed through the
plains of Polnich-Li&s;&s;a, and that the grand Ru&s;&s;ian army
had marched through Ko&s;ten and Gu&s;tin. The Prince,
finding it impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue them by that route, directed
his march to Glougau, where he learned that Bre&s;lau was
be&s;ieged by General Laudohn, and immediately advanced
by forced marches to its relief. Such was his expedition,
that in five days he marched above one hundred and twen|ty
Engli&s;h miles, and at his approach the Au&s;trian ge|neral
abandoned his enterpri&s;e. Thus, by his prudence
and activity, he not only prevented the junction of the
Ru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies, but al&s;o &s;aved the capital
of Sile&s;ia, and hampered Laudohn in &s;uch a manner as
&s;ubjected him to a defeat by the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, to
who&s;e motions we &s;hall now turn our attention.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Whether his de&s;ign was originally upon Dre&s;|den,
or he purpo&s;ed to co-operate with his brother Prince
Henry in Sile&s;ia, which his adver&s;aries &s;eemed to have
pitched upon as the &s;cene of their operations, we cannot
pre&s;ume to determine: but certain it is, he, in the begin|ning
of July, began his march in two columns through
Lu&s;atia, and Count Daun being informed of his march,
ordered his army to be put in motion. Leaving the army
of the empire, and the body of troops under Lacy, to guard
Saxony in his ab&s;ence, he marched with great expedition
towards Sile&s;ia, in full per&s;ua&s;ion that the Pru&s;&s;ian mo|narch
had thither directed his route. On the &s;eventh day
of July, the King, knowing that Daun was now removed
at a di&s;tance, repa&s;&s;ed the Pul&s;nitz, which he had pa&s;&s;ed
but two days before, and advanced with the van of his
army towards Lichtenberg, in order to attack the forces
of General Lacy, who was po&s;ted there; but the Au&s;trian
retired at his approach. Then the army marched to
<PB N="269" REF="274">
Marien&s;tern, where the King received intelligence that
Count Daun was in full march for Lauban, having al|ready
gained two marches upon the Pru&s;&s;ians. Perhaps
it was this intimation that determined the King to change
his plan, and return to the Elbe. On the eighth day of
the month he repa&s;&s;ed the Sprehe, in the neighbourhood of
Bautzen, and marched towards Dre&s;den with extraordinary
diligence. On the thirteenth his army having pa&s;&s;ed the
Elbe at Kadetz, on a bridge of boats, encamped be|tween
Pirna and Dre&s;den, which la&s;t he re&s;olved to be|&s;iege,
in hopes of reducing it before Count Daun could
return to its relief. How far this expectation was well
grounded we mu&s;t leave to the reader to judge, after hav|ing
ob&s;erved, that the place was now much more
defen&s;ible than it had been when the la&s;t attempt of the
Au&s;trians upon it mi&s;carried; that it was &s;ecured with a
numerous garri&s;on, commanded by General Macguire,
an officer of courage and experience. This governour
being &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, an&s;wered, that having the
honour to be entru&s;ted with the defence of the capital, he
would maintain it to the la&s;t extremity. Batteries were
immediately rai&s;ed again&s;t the town on both &s;ides of the
Elbe; and the poor inhabitants &s;ubjected to a dreadful
vi&s;itation, that their calamities might either drive them to
de&s;pair, or move the heart of the governour to embrace
articles of capitulation: but the&s;e expedients proved in|effectual.
Though the &s;uburbs towards the Pirna gate
were attacked and carried, this advantage made no im|pre&s;&s;ion
on General Macguire, who made &s;everal vigorous
&s;allies, and took every nece&s;&s;ary precaution for the de|fence
of the city, encouraged moreover by the vicinity of
Lacy's body, and the army of the empire, encamped in an
advantageous po&s;ition near Gros Seydlitz; and confident
that Count Daun would ha&s;ten to his relief. In this hope
he was not di&s;appointed; the Au&s;trian general, finding
him&s;elf duped by the &s;tratagem of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch,
and being made acquainted with his enterpri&s;e again&s;t
Dre&s;den, in&s;tantly wheeled about, and marched back with
<PB N="270" REF="275">
&s;uch rapidity, that on the nineteenth day of the month
he reached the neighbourhood of the capital of Saxony.
In con&s;equence of his approach the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e
heavy artillery was now arrived, redoubled his efforts
again&s;t the city, &s;o as to reduce to a&s;hes the cathedral
church, the new &s;quare, &s;everal noble &s;treets, &s;ome
palaces, together with the curious manufactory of por|celain.
His vengeance mu&s;t have been levelled again&s;t
the citizens; for it affected neither the fortifications, nor
the Au&s;trian garri&s;on, which Count Daun found means
to re-enforce with &s;ixteen battalions. This &s;upply, and
the neighbourhood of three ho&s;tile armies, rendered it
altogether impo&s;&s;ible to pro&s;ecute the &s;iege with any
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: the King, therefore, abandoned the
undertaking, withdrew his troops and artillery, and en|deavoured
to bring Daun to a battle, which that general
cautiou&s;ly avoided.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The fate of this prince &s;eemed now at its cri&s;is.
Notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of his brother Prince
Henry, the Ru&s;&s;ians were fa&s;t advancing to join Laudohn,
who had already blocked up Schweidnitz and Nie&s;s, and
their junction &s;eemed to threaten the lo&s;s of all Sile&s;ia.
The king had nothing to oppo&s;e to &s;uperiour numbers,
but &s;uperiour activity, of which he determined to avail
him&s;elf without delay. In&s;tead of making a feint towards
Sile&s;ia, he re&s;olved to march thither in earne&s;t; and for
that purpo&s;e, cro&s;&s;ing the Elbe, encamped at Dallwitz, on
the farther bank of the river, leaving General Hul&s;en, with
fifteen thou&s;and men, in the entrenched camp of Schlettow,
to maintain his footing in Saxony. On the third day of
Augu&s;t he began his march for Sile&s;ia, followed by Count
Daun with the grand Au&s;trian army, while the detached
body under Lacy took po&s;t at Rechenberg, and the Impe|rial
army encamped at Ke&s;&s;eldorf. Both the Pru&s;&s;ians
and Au&s;trians marched at the rate of one hundred miles in
five days: on the tenth the King took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
camp of Lignitz; and here he &s;eemed in danger of being
quite &s;urrounded by the enemy, who occupied the whole
<PB N="271" REF="276">
ground between Parchwitz and Co&s;&s;endan, an extent of
thirty miles. Count Daun's army formed the centre of
this chain, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the heighths of Wahl&s;tadt and
Hochkirk: General La$dohn covered the ground be|tween
Je&s;chkendorf and Co&s;chitz: the ri&s;ing grounds of
Parchwitz were &s;ecured by General Nauendorff; and
M. de Berk, who formed the left, extended his troops
beyond Co&s;&s;endau. The King marched in the night of
the eleventh, with a view to turn the enemy, and reach
Jauer; but at break of day he di&s;covered a new camp at
Prau&s;nitz, which con&s;i&s;ted of Lacy's detachment, ju&s;t
arrived from Lauban. The Pru&s;&s;ians immediately pa&s;&s;ed
the Katzbach, to attack this general, but he made &s;uch a
&s;kilful di&s;po&s;ition for a retreat towards the army of
Count Daun, that he not only baffled the endeavours of
the King to bring him to action, but, by po&s;ting him&s;elf
on the heighths of Hennerdorff, anticipated his march to
Jauer. In vain the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch attempted next
day to turn the enemy on the &s;ide of the mountains, by
Pom&s;en and Jager&s;dorff; the roads were found impa&s;&s;a|ble
to the ammunition waggons, and the King returned
to the camp at Lagnitz.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. While he remained in this &s;ituation he received
advice that four-and-twenty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians, under
Count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder at
Auras, where they intended to cro&s;s that river, and he
concluded the enemy had formed a de&s;ign to clo&s;e him in,
and attack him with their joint forces. Daun had, in|deed,
projected a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing him in the night, and
had actually put his army in motion for that purpo&s;e;
but he was anticipated by the vigilance and good fortune
of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. That Prince, reflecting that if
he &s;hould wait for his adver&s;aries in his camp he ran the
ri&s;k of being attacked at the &s;ame time by Lacy on his
right, by Daun in his front, and by Laudohn on his
left, he altered his po&s;ition, in order to di&s;concert their
operations; and on the fourteenth day of the month,
marched to the heighths of P&s;a&s;&s;endorff, where he formed
<PB N="272" REF="277">
his army in order of battle. Receiving intimation, about
two in the morning, that Laudhon was in full march, ad|vancing
in columns, by Bennowitz, he divided his army
into two &s;eparate bodies. One of the&s;e remained on the
ground, in order to maintain the po&s;t again&s;t any attempts
that might be made by Count Daun to &s;uccour Laudohn;
and that this &s;ervice might be the more effectually per|formed,
the heighths were fortified with batteries, &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly
di&s;po&s;ed as to impede and over-awe the whole
Au&s;trian army. The King, having taken this precaution,
wheeled about with &s;ixteen battalions and thirty &s;qua|drons,
to fall upon Laudohn as he &s;hould advance; but
that general knew nothing of his de&s;ign, until he him&s;el$
arrived at the village of P&s;affendorff, about three in the
morning, when the day dawning, and a thick fog gra|dually
di&s;per&s;ing, the whole detachment of the Pru&s;&s;ian
army appeared in order of battle, in a well cho&s;en &s;ituation
&s;trengthened with a numerous train of artillery, placed $word$
the be&s;t advantage. Laudohn was not a little mortifi$$
to find him&s;elf caught in his own &s;nare; but he had ad|vanced
too far to recede, and, therefore, making a $word$
of nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;olved to &s;tand an engagement. With th$$
view he formed his troops as well as the time, place, and
circum&s;tance would permit; and the Pru&s;&s;ians $word$
to the attack, a &s;evere action en&s;ued. The King ro$$
along the line to animate the troops, and &s;uperintended
every part of the charge, hazarding his life in $span$
dangerous &s;cenes of the battle to &s;uch a degree, that $word$
hor&s;e was killed under him, and his clothes we $word$
through in &s;everal places. The Au&s;trians maintained $word$
con$lict with great ob&s;tinacy until &s;ix in the morning
when they gave ground, and were pur&s;ued to $word$
Katzbach, beyond which the King would not $word$
troops to pro&s;ecute the advantage they had gained, th$$
they might be able to &s;uccour the right, in ca&s;e Ma$e$chal
Count Daun &s;hould &s;ucceed in his atte$$$
to advance again&s;t them from L$g$itz. That g$$+neral
had actually begun his march to fall upon $word$
<PB N="273" REF="278">
Pru&s;&s;ians on one &s;ide, while Laudohn &s;hould attack them
on the other; but he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find they
were decamped, and when he perceived a thick cloud of
&s;moke at a di&s;tance, he immediately comprehended the
nature of the King's management. He then attempted to
advance by Lignitz; but the troops and artillery which
had been left on the height of P&s;affendorff, to di&s;pute his
march, were &s;o advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, as to render all
his efforts abortive. Laudohn is &s;aid to have lo&s;t in the
action above eight thou&s;and men, killed, wounded, and
taken, including eighty officers, with twenty-three pair of
colours, and eighty-two pieces of cannon: over and above
this lo&s;s, the Au&s;trian general &s;uffered greatly by de&s;ertion.
The Pru&s;&s;ians obtained the victory at the expen&s;e of one
general, with five hundred men killed, and twelve hun|dred
wounded. Immediately after the action the victor
marched to Parchwitz; while Daun detached Prince
Lowen&s;tein and General Beck, with the re&s;erve of his
army, to join Prince Czernichew, who had cro&s;&s;ed the
Oder at Auras; but he was &s;o intimidated by the defeat
at Lignitz, that he forthwith repa&s;&s;ed the river, and
Prince Lowen&s;tein retired on the &s;ide of Jauer. By this
bold and well-conducted adventure, the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch
not only e&s;caped the mo&s;t imminent hazard of a total de|feat
from the joint efforts of two &s;trong armies, but al&s;o
prevented the dreaded junction of the Ru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;tri|an
forces. His bu&s;ine&s;s now was to open the communicati|on
with Bre&s;lau and his brother Prince Henry, whom he
joined at Neumarcke. The Prince, after Laudohn was
obliged to relinqui&s;h the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau, had kept a
watchful eye over the motions of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, which
had advanced into the neighbourhood of that city, and, with|out
all doubt, would have bombarded it from &s;ome com|manding
heighths, had they not been prevented by Prince
Henry, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e po&s;ts, and fortified
them with redoubts. The King, having freed Bre&s;lau
from the neighbourhood of his enemies, and being
&s;trengthened by the junction with his brother, left a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="274" REF="279">
detachment under the command of General
Boltze, to protect the country again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian irre|gulars;
and advanced with his whole force to the relief
of Schweidnitz, which was blocked up by the Au&s;trian
army under the command of the Mare&s;chal Count Daun.
In his march he fell upon a &s;eparate body under General
Beck, made two battalions of Croats pri&s;oners, and di&s;|per&s;ed
&s;everal &s;quadrons. This atchievement had &s;uch an
effect upon the enemy, that they rai&s;ed the blockade, and
retreated with &s;ome precipitation to the mountains of
Land &s;hut.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. While the King thus exerted him&s;elf, with a
&s;pirit altogether unexampled, in defending Sile&s;ia, General
Hul&s;en, who commanded his troops in Saxony, was ex|po&s;ed
to the mo&s;t imminent danger. Under&s;tanding that
the army of the empire had formed a de&s;ign to cut off his
communication with Torgau, he quitted his camp at
Mei&s;&s;en, and marched to Strehla. The enemy having
divided their forces into two bodies, one of them, on the
twentieth day of Augu&s;t, attacked an advanced po&s;t of the
Pru&s;&s;ians; while the other was di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a man|ner,
as to over-awe Hul&s;en's camp, and prevent him from
taking any &s;tep for the relief of his battalions, who main|tained
their ground with difficulty again&s;t a &s;uperior num|ber
of the a&s;&s;ailants. In this emergency the Pru&s;&s;ian
general ordered his cavalry to make a circuit round a ri|&s;ing
ground, and, if po&s;&s;ible, charge the enemy in &s;lank.
This order was executed with equal vigour and &s;ucce&s;s.
They fell upon the Imperial army with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity,
as drove their battalions and hor&s;e upon each other in the
utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. A con&s;iderable number of the enemy
were &s;lain, and forty-one officers, with twelve hundred
men, made pri&s;oners. By this advantage, which was ob|tained
at a very &s;mall expen&s;e, General Hul&s;en opened for
him&s;elf a way to Torgau, whither he in&s;tantly retreated,
perceiving that the whole army of the Imperiali&s;ts was
advancing to cut off his communication with the Elbe.
<PB N="275" REF="280">
This retreat furni&s;hed the enemy with a pretext for
claiming the victory.</P>
<P>&sect; X. After all the&s;e heroick endeavours of the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch and his officers, his affairs remained in &s;uch a
de&s;perate &s;ituation as &s;eemed to pre&s;age approaching ruin:
for, though in per&s;on he commanded a numerous and well
appointed army, he found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to guard
again&s;t the different detachments from the three &s;eparate
armies of his adver&s;aries. Bodies of Au&s;trian troops
&s;coured the country of Lu&s;atia; the Ru&s;&s;ians traver&s;ed
part of Sile&s;ia, and made irruptions even into Branden|burg:
the Imperial army domineered in Saxony: the
Swedi&s;h army, meeting with no oppo&s;ition, advanced into
the heart of Pomerania; &s;o that the King was not only
threatened on every &s;ide, but all corre&s;pondence between
him and his hereditary dominions was at this juncture
intercepted.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. His adver&s;aries, having been hitherto baffled by
his activity and re&s;olution in their de&s;igns upon Sile&s;ia,
now meditated a &s;cheme, the execution of which he could
not but feel in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner. The Ru&s;&s;ian
army being on its retreat from Sile&s;ia, Count Czernichew
was &s;ent with a &s;trong detachment into the Marche of
Brandenburg; while a numerous body of Au&s;trians,
under Lacy and Bretano, penetrated into the &s;ame country
from Saxony, with in&s;tructions to join the Ru&s;&s;ians at the
gates of Berlin. The Pru&s;&s;ian general, Hul&s;en, finding
him&s;elf too weak to cope with the army of the Empire in
Mi&s;nia, had fallen back to this capital, where he was
joined by the troops under General Werner, lately re|turned
from Pomerania; but as their forces, after this
junction, did not exceed &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, and the
allies advancing again&s;t them amounted to forty thou&s;and,
they would not pretend to oppo&s;e the enemy in the open
field, nor to de&s;end a city of &s;uch extent, and &s;o imper|fectly
fortified. Such an attempt would have only ex|po&s;ed
their troops to ruin, without being able to &s;ave the
capital, which, on the contrary, would have been the more
<PB N="276" REF="281">
&s;everely handled, in con&s;equence of their oppo&s;ition.
They, therefore, re&s;olved to retire, after having repul&s;ed
the advanced guard of the Ru&s;&s;ians under Tottleben,
which attacked the gates, and even bombarded the town,
before the great armies appeared. At their approach the
Pru&s;&s;ian generals retreated, leaving three weak battalions
in the place, in hopes they might be the means of obtain|ing
&s;ome &s;ort of terms for the city. They made no re&s;i&s;t|ance,
however, but on the fir&s;t &s;ummons propo&s;ed articles
of capitulation, which being refu&s;ed, they &s;urrendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. In favour of the city the fo|reign
mini&s;ters there re&s;iding interpo&s;ed their mediation
with &s;uch zeal and &s;ucce&s;s, that tolerable conditions were
obtained. The inhabitants were indulged with the free ex|erci&s;e
of their religion, and an immunity from violence to
their per&s;ons and effects. The enemy promi&s;ed that the
Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars &s;hould not enter the town; and that the
King's palace &s;hould not be violated. The&s;e articles being
ratified, the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian troops entered the place,
where they totally de&s;troyed the magazines, ar&s;enals, and
founderies, with an immen&s;e quantity of military &s;tores,
and a great number of cannon and &s;mall arms: then they
demanded the immediate payment of eight hundred thou|&s;and
guilders; and afterwards exacted a contribution of
one million nine hundred thou&s;and German crowns,
Many outrages were committed by the licentious &s;oldiery,
in &s;pite of all the precautions which the officers could
take to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline. The hou&s;es
of the private inhabitants were tolerably protected, but the
King's palaces were &s;ubjected to the mo&s;t rigorous treat|ment.
In the royal palace of Charlottenburg they pillaged
and &s;poiled the rich furniture; they defaced and mutilated
the valuable pictures and antique &s;tatues collected by Car|dinal
de Polignac, and purcha&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Bra$|denburg.
The ca&s;tle of Schonhau&s;en, belonging to the
Queen, and that of Fredericksfeldt, the property of th$
Margrave Charles, were pillaged of effects to a very con+&s;iderable
value. The palace of Pot&s;dam was effectually
<PB N="277" REF="282">
protected by Prince E&s;terha&s;i, who would not &s;uffer one
article of furniture or ornament to be touched, but de|&s;ired
leave to take one picture of the King, and two of his
german &s;lutes, that he might pre&s;erve them as memorials
of an illu&s;trious prince, who&s;e heroick character he ad|mired.
The Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian troops entered Berlin
on the ninth day of October, and quitted it on the thir|teenth,
on hearing that the King was in full march to the
relief of his capital. In their retreat, by different routes,
from Brandenburg, they drove away all the cattle and
hor&s;es they could find, ravaged the country, and committed
brutal outrages on the inhabitants, which the pretence of
retaliation could never excu&s;e. The body of Ru&s;&s;ians
which entered Berlin marched from thence into Poland,
by the way of Fur&s;tenwalde, while the Au&s;trians took the
route of Saxony, from whence they had advanced into
Brandenburg. Mean while the town of Wirtemberg, in
that electorate, was reduced by the Duke de Deux Ponts,
commander of the Imperial army, which, in conjunction
with the Au&s;trians, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters al&s;o of
Torgau and Leip&s;ick.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in his march through
Lu&s;atia, was &s;till attended by Count Daun, at the head of
his grand army, and both pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe about the latter
end of October. The Pru&s;&s;ian cro&s;&s;ed the river at Co&s;|wick,
where he was joined by the troops under Prince
Eugene of Wirtemberg and General Hul&s;en, &s;o that his
army now amounted to eighty thou&s;and fighting men,
with whom he re&s;olved to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of import|ance.
Indeed, at this time his &s;ituation was truely critical.
General Laudohn, with a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;trians,
remained in Sile&s;ia; the Ru&s;&s;ian army &s;till threatened
Bre&s;lau, the capital of that country. The Imperiali&s;ts
and Au&s;trians had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the great towns in
Saxony, and were ma&s;ters on both &s;ides of the Elbe. In
the ea&s;tern part of Pomerania the Ru&s;&s;ians had inve&s;ted
Colberg by &s;ea and land, &s;eemingly determined to reduce
the place, that they might have a &s;ea-port, by which they
<PB N="278" REF="283">
could be &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, ammunition, nece&s;&s;aries,
and re-enforcements, without the trouble and inconveni|ence
of a long and laborious march from the banks of the
Vi&s;tula. On the we&s;tern &s;ide of Pomerania, the war,
which had hitherto langui&s;hed, was renewed by the Swedes
with uncommon vivacity. They pa&s;&s;ed the river Pene
without oppo&s;ition; and obliging General Stutterheim to
retreat, advanced as far as Stran&s;berg. That officer,
however, being re-enforced, attacked a Swedi&s;h po&s;t at
Pa&s;&s;elvalik, &s;l$w about five hundred of the enemy, and
took an equal number, with &s;ix pieces of cannon; but he
was not numerous enough to keep the field again&s;t their
whole army. Thus the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch &s;aw him&s;elf ob|liged
to abandon Sile&s;ia, deprived of all the places he held
in Saxony, which had been his be&s;t re&s;ource, and in danger
of being driven into his hereditary country of Branden|burg,
which was unable either to maintain, or even to
recruit his army. On this emergency he re&s;olved to make
one de&s;perate effort again&s;t the grand Au&s;trian army,
under Count Daun, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe at Torgau,
and advanced to Eulenbourg, from whence, however, he
retreated to his former camp at Torgau, and the King
cho&s;e his &s;ituation between this la&s;t place and Schilda, at
Lang-Reichenbach, where his hu&s;&s;ars attacked a body of
hor&s;e under General Brentano, and made four hundred
pri&s;oners. The right wing of the Au&s;trians being at
Gro&s;wich, and their left at Torgau, the Pru&s;&s;ian King
determined to attack them next day, which was the third
of November. His de&s;ign was to march through the
wood of Torgau by three different routes, with thirty bat|talions
and fifty &s;quadrons of his left wing: the fir&s;t line
was ordered to advance by the way of Mackrene to Neiden;
the &s;econd, by Peckhutte to El&s;nick; and the third, con|&s;i&s;ting
of cavalry, to penetrate by the wood of Wilden|hayn
to Vogel&s;ang. On the other hand, General Zei|then
was directed to take the great Leip&s;ick road, with
thirty battalions and &s;eventy &s;quadrons of the right; and
quitting it at the ponds of Torgau, to attack the villages of
<PB N="279" REF="284">
Suptitz and Gro&s;wich. The King's line, in its march, fell
in with a corps of Au&s;trians under General Reid, who
retired into the wood of Torgau; and another more con|&s;iderable
body, po&s;ted in the wood of Wildenhayn, like|wi&s;e
retreated to Gro&s;chutz, after having fired &s;ome pieces
of artillery: but the dragoons of St. Ignon, being en|clo&s;ed
between two columns of Pru&s;&s;ian infantry, were
either killed or taken. By two in the afternoon the King
had penetrated through the wood to the plain of Neiden,
from whence another body of the enemy retired to Tor|gau,
where a continued noi&s;e of cannon and &s;mall arms
declared that General Zeithen was already engaged. The
Pru&s;&s;ians immediately advanced at a quicker pace, and
pa&s;&s;ing the mora&s;&s;es near Neiden, inclined to the right in
three lines, and &s;oon came to action. Daun had cho&s;en
a very advantageous po&s;ition: his right extended to
Gro&s;wich, and his left to Zinne; while his infantry oc|cupied
&s;ome eminences along the road of Leip&s;ick, and his
front was &s;trengthened with $word$ le&s;s than two hundred
pieces of cannon. His &s;econd line was di&s;po&s;ed on an ex|tent
of ground, which terminated in hillocks towards the
Elbe; and again&s;t this the King directed his attack.
He had already given his troops to under&s;tand, that his
affairs were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, they mu&s;t either conquer
or peri&s;h; and they began the battle with the mo&s;t de|&s;perate
impetuo&s;ity; but they met with &s;uch a warm re|ception
from the artillery, &s;mall arms, and in particular
from the Au&s;trian carabiniers, that their grenadiers were
&s;hattered and repul&s;ed. The &s;econd charge, though en|forced
with incredible vigour, was equally un&s;ucce&s;sful:
then the King ordered his cavalry to advance, and they
fell upon &s;ome regiments of infantry with &s;uch fury as
obliged them to give way. The&s;e, however, were com|pelled
to retire, in their turn, before about &s;eventy bat|talions
of the enemy, who advanced towards Torgau,
&s;tretching with their right to the Elbe, and their left
to Zinne. While the Prince of Hol&s;tein rallied his ca|valry,
and returned to the charge, the third line of Pru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="280" REF="285">
infantry attacked the vineyard of Suptitz, and Gen. Zei|then,
with the right wing, took the enemy in rear. This
di&s;po&s;ition threw the Au&s;trians into di&s;order, which was
greatly augmented by the di&s;a&s;ter of Count Daun, who
was dangerou&s;ly wounded in the thigh, and carried off the
field of battle. But the Pru&s;&s;ians could not pur&s;ue their
victory, becau&s;e the action had la&s;ted until nine; and the
night being unu&s;ually dark, facilitated the retreat of the
enemy, who cro&s;&s;ed the Elbe on three bridges of boats,
thrown over the river at Torgau. The victor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the field of battle, with &s;even thou&s;and pri&s;oners, in|cluding
two hundred officers, twenty-nine pair of colours,
one &s;tandard, and about forty pieces of cannon. The car|nage
was very great on both &s;ides: about three thou&s;and
Pru&s;&s;ians were killed, and five thou&s;and wounded; and,
in the fir&s;t attacks, two general officers, with fifteen hun|dred
&s;oldiers, were made pri&s;oners by the enemy. The
King, as u&s;ual, expo&s;ed his per&s;on in every part of the
battle, and a mu&s;ket-ball grazed upon his brea&s;t. In the
morning the King of Pru&s;&s;ia entered Torgau: then he
&s;ecured Mei&s;&s;en, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Freyberg; &s;o that,
in con&s;equence of this well-timed victory, his po&s;ition was
nearly the &s;ame as at the opening of the campaign.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The Au&s;trians, however, notwith&s;tanding this
check, maintained their ground in the neighbourhood of
Dre&s;den; while the Pru&s;&s;ians were di&s;tributed in quarters
of cantonment in and about Leip&s;ick and Mei&s;&s;en. As the
Au&s;trian general had, after the battle, recalled his detach|ments,
General Laudohn abandoned Land&s;hut, which
again fell into the hands of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and the Imperial
army was obliged to retire into Franconia. The Swedes
having penetrated a great way into Pomerania, returned
again to their winter-quarters at Stral&s;und; and the
Ru&s;&s;ian generals mea&s;ured back their way to the Vi&s;tula:
&s;o that the confederates gained little el&s;e in the cour&s;e of
this campaign but the contributions which they rai&s;ed in
Berlin, and the open country of Brandenburg. Had all
the allies been heartily bent upon cru&s;hing the Pru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="281" REF="286">
monarch, one would imagine the Ru&s;&s;ians and Swedes
might have joined their forces in Pomerania, and made
good their winter-quarters in Brandenburg, where they
could have been &s;upplied with magazines from the Baltick,
and been at hand to commence their operations in the
&s;pring: but, in all probability, &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment in
the empire would have given umbrage to the Germanick
body.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The diet of Poland being a&s;&s;embled in the
beginning of October, the King entertained the mo&s;t
&s;anguine hope they would take &s;ome re&s;olution in his fa|vour;
but the parti&s;ans of Pru&s;&s;ia fru&s;trated all his en|deavours:
one of the deputies prote&s;ting again&s;t holding
a diet while there were foreign troops in the kingdom,
the a&s;&s;embly broke up in a tumultuous manner, even be|fore
they had cho&s;en a mare&s;chal. The diet of Sweden,
which was convoked about the &s;ame period, &s;eemed de|termined
to proceed upon bu&s;ine&s;s. They elected Count
Axel Fer&s;on their grand mare&s;chal, in oppo&s;ition to Count
Horn, by a great majority; which was an unlucky cir|cum&s;tance
for the Pru&s;&s;ian intere&s;t at Stockholm, ina&s;|much
as the &s;ame majority ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in opinion,
that the war &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted in the &s;pring with re|doubled
vigour, and the army in Germany re-enforced to
the number of at lea&s;t thirty thou&s;and fighting men. This
unfavourable circum&s;tance made but little impre&s;&s;ion
upon the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, who had maintained his
ground with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s &s;ince the
beginning of the campaign, and now enjoyed in pro&s;pect
the benefit of winter, which he is &s;aid to have termed
his be&s;t auxiliary.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The animo&s;ity which inflamed the contending
parties was not con$ined to the operations in war: but
broke out, as u&s;ual, in printed declarations, which the
belligerent powers diffu&s;ed all over Europe. In the begin|ning
of the &s;ea&s;on the &s;tates of the circle of We&s;tphalia had
been required, by the Imperial court, to furni&s;h their con|tingent
of troops again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or to com|mute
<PB N="282" REF="287">
for this contingent with a &s;um of money. In con|&s;equence
of this demand, &s;ome of the We&s;tphalian e&s;tates
had &s;ent deputies to confer with the a&s;&s;embly of the circle
of Cologn; and to the&s;e the King &s;ignified, by a decla|ration,
dated at Mun&s;ter, that as this demand of money,
in&s;tead of troops, was no le&s;s extraordinary than contrary
to the con&s;titutions of the empire, &s;hould they comply
with it, or even continue to a&s;&s;i&s;t his enemies either with
troops or money, he would con&s;ider them as having
actually taken part in the war again&s;t him and his allies,
and treat them accordingly on all occa&s;ions. This inti|mation
produced little effect in his favour. The Duke of
Mecklenbourg adhered to the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e; and the
Elector of Cologn co-operated with the French in their
de&s;igns again&s;t Hanover. By way of retaliation for this
partiality, the Pru&s;&s;ians ravaged the country of Mecklen|bourg,
and the Hanoverians levied contributions in the
territories of Cologn. The parties thus aggrieved had
recour&s;e to complaints and remon&s;trances. The Duke's
envoy at Rati&s;bon communicated a re&s;cript to the Im|perial
mini&s;ters, repre&s;enting, that the Pru&s;&s;ian troops
under General Werner and Colonel de Belling had
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his country in the autumn by grievous extor|tions;
that afterwards Prince Eugene of Wi$temberg,
in the &s;ervice of Pru&s;&s;ia, had demanded an exorbitant
quantity of provi&s;ions, with &s;ome millions of money, and
a great number of recruits: or, in lieu of the&s;e, that the
Duke's forces &s;hould act under the Pru&s;&s;ian banner. He
therefore declared, that as the country of Mecklenbourg was
impoveri&s;hed, and almo&s;t depopulated by the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions,
the Duke would find him&s;elf obliged to take mea&s;ures for
the future &s;ecurity of his &s;ubjects, if not immediately favour|ed
with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the court of Vienna as would
put a &s;top to the&s;e violent proceedings. This declaration
was, by &s;ome, con&s;idered as the prelude of his renounc|ing
his engagements with the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. As the
Imperial court had threatened to put the Elector of Hanover
under the ban of the Empire, in con&s;equence of the ho|&s;tilities
<PB N="283" REF="288">
which his troops had committed in the electorate
of Cologn, his re&s;ident at Rati&s;bon delivered to the mini|&s;ters
who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the diet a memorial, remon&s;trating,
that the Emperour hath no power, &s;ingly, to &s;ubject any
prince to the ban, or declare him a rebel; and that, by
arrogating &s;uch a power, he expo&s;ed his authority to the
&s;ame contempt into which the Pope's bulls of excom|munication
were &s;o ju&s;tly fallen. With re&s;pect to the
Elector of Cologn, he ob&s;erved, that this prince was the
fir&s;t who commenced ho&s;tilities, by allowing his troops to
co-operate with the French in their inva&s;ion of Hanover,
and by celebrating with rejoicings the advantages which
they had gained in that electorate: he, therefore, gave the
e&s;tates of the empire to under&s;tand, that the be&s;t way of
&s;creening their &s;ubjects from ho&s;tile treatment would be
a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of neutrality in the pre&s;ent di&s;putes of
the empire.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. This was a &s;train much more effectual among
princes and powers who are generally actuated by inte|re&s;ted
motives, than was the repetition of complaints,
equally pathetick and unavailing, uttered by the unfortu|nate
King of Poland, Elector of Saxony. The damage
done to his capital by the la&s;t attempt of the Pru&s;&s;ian mo|narch
on that city affected the old king in &s;uch a man|ner,
that he publi&s;hed at Vienna an appeal to all the
powers of Europe, from the cruelty and unprecedented
outrages which di&s;tingui&s;hed the conduct of his adver|&s;aries
in Saxony. All Europe pitied the hard fate of
this exiled prince, and &s;ympathi&s;ed with the di&s;a&s;ters of
his country; but, in the brea&s;ts of his enemies, rea&s;ons
of &s;tate and convenience over-ruled the &s;ugge&s;tions of
humanity; and his friends had hitherto exerted them|&s;elves
in vain for the deliverance of his people.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. From this detail of continental affairs, our
attention is recalled to Great-Britain, by an incident of a
very intere&s;ting nature; an account of which, however,
we &s;hall po&s;tpone until we have recorded the &s;ucce&s;s that,
in the cour&s;e of this year, attended the Briti&s;h arms in the
<PB N="284" REF="289">
Ea&s;t-Indies. We have already ob&s;erved, that Colonel
Coote, after having defeated the French general Lally
in the field, and reduced divers of the enemy's &s;ettlements
on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, at length cooped them up
within the walls of Pondicherry, the principal &s;eat of the
French Ea&s;t-India company, large, populous, well fortified,
and &s;ecured with a numerous garri&s;on, under the imme|diate
command of their general. In the month of October
Admiral Stevens &s;ailed from Trincomal&egrave; with all his
&s;quadron, in order to its being refitted, except five &s;ail of
the line, which he left under the command of Captain
Haldane, to block up Pondicherry by &s;ea, while Mr.
Coote carried on his operations by land. By this di&s;po|&s;ition,
and the vigilance of the Briti&s;h officers the place
was &s;o hampered, as to be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of pro|vi&s;ions,
even before the &s;iege could be undertaken in form;
for the rainy &s;ea&s;on rendered all regular approaches im|practicable.
The&s;e rains being abated by the twenty-&s;ixth
day of November, Colonel Coote directed the engineers
to pitch upon proper places for erecting batteries that
&s;hould enfilade or flank the works of the garri&s;on, with|out
expo&s;ing their own men to any &s;evere fire from the
enemy. Accordingly, four batteries were con&s;tructed in
different places, &s;o as to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, and opened
altogether on the eighth day of December, at midnight.
Though rai&s;ed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, they were plied
with good effect, and the be&s;ieged returned the fire with
great vivacity. This mutual cannonading continued un|til
the twenty-ninth day of the month, when the engi|neers
were employed in rai&s;ing another battery, near
enough to effect a breach in the north-we&s;t counter-guard
and curtain. Though the approaches were retarded &s;ome
days by a violent &s;torm, which almo&s;t ruined the works,
the damage was &s;oon repaired: a con&s;iderable po&s;t was
taken from the enemy by a&s;&s;ault, and afterwards regained
by the French grenadiers, through the timidity of the
&s;ipoys by whom it was occupied. By the fifteenth day
of January, a &s;econd battery being rai&s;ed within point-blank,
<PB N="285" REF="290">
a breach was made in the curtain: the we&s;t face
and flank of the north-we&s;t ba&s;tion were ruined, and the
guns of the enemy entirely &s;ilenced. The garri&s;on and
inhabitants of Pondicherry were now reduced to an
extremity of famine which would admit of no he&s;itation.
General Lally &s;ent a colonel, attended by the chief of
the Je&s;uits, and two civilians, to Mr. Coote, with propo|&s;als
of &s;urrendering the garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war, and de|manding
a capitulation in behalf of the French Ea&s;t-India
company. On this la&s;t &s;ubject he made no reply;
but next morning took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town and citadel,
where he found a great quantity of artillery, ammunition,
&s;mall arms, and military &s;tores; then he &s;ecured the gar|ri&s;on,
amounting to above two thou&s;and Europeans.
Lally made a gallant defence, and, had he been properly
&s;upplied with provi&s;ions, the conque&s;t of the place would
not have been &s;o ea&s;ily atchieved. He certainly flattered
him&s;elf with the hope of being &s;upplied; otherwi&s;e an
officer of his experience would have demanded a capitula|tion
before he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of acquie&s;cing
in any terms the be&s;ieger might have thought proper to
impo&s;e. That he &s;pared no pains to procure &s;upplies
appears from an intercepted letter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">&startq;Mon&s;ieur Raymond&mdash;the Engli&s;h &s;quadron is no more, Sir&mdash;of the twelve &s;hips they had in our road, &s;even are lo&s;t, crews and all; the other four $i&s;ma&s;ted; and no more than one frigate hath e&s;caped&mdash;therefore, lo&s;e not an in&s;tant in &s;ending chelingoes upon chelingoes, laden with rice&mdash;The Dutch have nothing to fear now.

billet is no bad &s;ketch of the writer's character,
which &s;eems to have a &s;trong tincture of oddity and ex|travagance.</P>

&sect; XVIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1760.</NOTE> By the reduction of Pondicherry the French
intere&s;t was annihilated on the coa&s;t of Coromandel, and
therefore of the utmo&s;t importance to the Briti&s;h nation.
It may be doubted, however, whether Colonel Coote,
with all his &s;pirit, vigilance, and military talents, could
have &s;ucceeded in this enterpri&s;e without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the &s;quadron, which co-operated with him by &s;ea, and
effectually excluded all &s;uccour from the be&s;ieged. It
mu&s;t be owned, for the honour of the &s;ervice, that no
incident interrupted the good under&s;tanding which was
maintained between the land and &s;ea-officers, who vied
with each other in contributing their utmo&s;t efforts to|wards
the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. On the twenty-fifth
day of December Rear-Admiral Stevens arrived with
four &s;hips of the line, having parted with Rear-Admiral
Corni&s;h and his divi&s;ion in &s;tormy weather: but he join|ed
them at Pondicherry before the place was &s;urrendered.
On the fir&s;t day of January a violent tempe&s;t obliged Ad|miral
Stevens to &s;lip his cables and put to &s;ea, where he
parted with the re&s;t of his &s;quadron; and when in three
days he returned to the road of Pondicherry, he had
the mortification to find that his divi&s;ion had &s;uffered &s;e|verely
from the &s;torm. The &s;hips of war called the Duke
of Aquitaine and the Sunderland foundered in the &s;torm,
and their crews peri&s;hed. The Newca&s;tle, the Queen|borough,
and the Protector fire&s;hip, were driven a-&s;hore,
and de&s;troyed; but the men were &s;aved, together with
the cannon, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions. Many other &s;hips
&s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage, which, however, was
&s;oon repaired. Admiral Stevens having intercepted the let|ter
from Lally to Raymond (in&s;erted in p. 285) immediately
di&s;patched letters to the Dutch and Dani&s;h &s;ettlements on
this coa&s;t, intimating, that, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;inu|ations
of General Lally, he had eleven &s;ail of the line,
with two frigates, under his command, all &s;it for &s;ervice,
in the road of Pondicherry, which was clo&s;ely inve&s;ted
and blockaded both by &s;ea and land: he, therefore, de|clared,
that as in that ca&s;e it was contrary to the law of
<PB N="287" REF="292">
nations for any neutral power to relieve or &s;uccour the be|&s;ieged,
he was determined to &s;elfe any ve&s;&s;el that &s;hould
attempt to throw provi&s;ions into the place.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. While the arms of Great-Britain &s;till pro&s;per|ed
in every effort tending to the real intere&s;t of the nation,
an event happened, which, for a moment, ob&s;cured the
&s;plendour of her triumphs; and could not but be very
alarming to tho&s;e German allies, whom her liberality had
enabled to maintain an expen&s;ive and &s;anguinary war of
humour and ambition. On the twenty-fifth day of Octo|ber,
George II. King of Great-Britain, without any pre|vious
di&s;order, was, in the morning, &s;uddenly &s;ei&s;ed with
the agony of death, at the palace at Ken&s;ington. He
had ri&s;en at his u&s;ual hour, drunk his chocolate, and en|quired
about the wind, as anxious for the arrival of the
foreign mails; then he opened a window of his apartment,
and perceiving the weather was &s;erene, declared he would
walk in the garden. In a few minutes after this decla|ration,
while he remained alone in the chamber, he fell
down upon the floor; the noi&s;e of his fall brought his at|tendants
into the room, who lifted him on the bed, where
he de&s;ired, in a faint voice, that the Prince&s;s Amolia might
be called; but before &s;he could reach the apartment he had
expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but with|out
effect; and indeed his malady was far beyond the reach
of art; for when the cavity of the thorax or che&s;t was
opened, and in&s;pected by the &s;erjeant-&s;urgeons, they
found the right ventricle of the heart actually ruptured,
and a great quantity of blood di&s;charged through the aper|ture
into the &s;urrounding pericardium; &s;o that he mu&s;t
have died in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, in con&s;equence of the effu&s;ion.
The ca&s;e, however, was &s;o extraordinary, that we que&s;tion
whether there is &s;uch another in&s;tance upon record.&mdash;A
rupture of this nature appears the more remarkable, as it
happened to a prince of a healthy con&s;titution, unaccu|&s;tomed
to exce&s;s, and far advanced beyond that period
of life, when the blood might be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;low with
a dangerous impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="293">
&sect; XX. Thus died George II. at the age of &s;eventy-&s;even,
after a long reign of thirty-four years, di&s;tingui&s;hed
by a variety of important events, and checquered with a
viciffitude of character and fortune. He was in his per&s;on
rather lower than the middle &s;ize, well &s;haped, erect, with
eyes remarkably prominent, a high no&s;e, and fair com|plexion.
In his di&s;po&s;ition he is &s;aid to have been ha&s;ty,
prone to anger, e&s;pecially in his youth, yet &s;oon appea&s;ed;
otherwi&s;e mild, moderate, and humane: in his way of
living temperate, regular, and &s;o methodical in every
branch of private oeconomy, that his attention de&s;cended
to objects which a great king (perhaps) had better over|look.
He was fond of military pomp and parade; and
per&s;onally brave. He loved war as a &s;oldier; he &s;tudied
it as a &s;cience; and corre&s;ponded on this &s;ubject with &s;ome
of the greate&s;t officers whom Germany has produced.
The extent of his under&s;tanding, and the &s;plendour of
his virtue, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to a&s;certain, or attempt
to di&s;play; we rather wi&s;h for opportunities to expatiate on
his munificence and liberality; his generous regard to
genius and learning; his royal encouragement and pro|tection
of tho&s;e arts by which a nation is at once bene|fited
and adorned. With re&s;pect to his government, it
very &s;eldom deviated from the in&s;titutions of laws; or en|croached
upon private property; or interfered with the
common admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The circum&s;tances
that chiefly marked his public character, were a predi|lection
for his native country, and a clo&s;e attention to
the political intere&s;ts of the Germanick body: points and
principles to which he adhered with the mo&s;t invincible
fortitude; and if ever the blood and trea&s;u$$ of Great-Britain
were &s;acrificed to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we ought
not &s;o much to blame the prince, who acted from the
dictates of natural affection, as we &s;hould dete&s;t a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of venal mini&s;ters, all of whom in their tur$s de|voted
them&s;elves, &s;oul and body, to the gratification of
this pa&s;&s;ion, or partiality, &s;o prejudicial to the true in|tere&s;t
of their country.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294">
&sect; XXI. The reign of George II. produced many revo|lutions,
as well in the internal &s;chemes of oeconomy and
admini&s;tration, as in the external projects of political con|nexions;
revolutions that expo&s;ed the frailties of human
nature, and demon&s;trated the in&s;tability of &s;y&s;tems founded
upon convenience. In the cour&s;e of this reign a &s;tanding
army was, by dint of mini&s;terial influence, engrafted on
the con&s;titution of Great-Britain. A fatal &s;troke was
given to the liberty of the pre&s;s, by the act &s;ubjecting
all dramatick writings to the in&s;pection of a licen&s;er.
The great machine of corruption, contrived to &s;ecure a
con&s;tant majority in parliament, was overturned, and
the inventor of it obliged to quit the reins of government.
Profe&s;&s;ed patriots re&s;igned the principles they had long en|deavoured
to e&s;tabli&s;h, and li&s;ted them&s;elves for the de|fence
of that fortre&s;s again&s;t which their zeal and talents
had been levelled. The management of a mighty king|dom
was con&s;igned into the hands of a motley admini|&s;tration,
mini&s;ters without knowledge, and men without
integrity, who&s;e councils were timid, weak, and waver|ing;
who&s;e folly and extravagance expo&s;ed the nation to
ridicule and contempt; by who&s;e ignorance and pre|&s;umption
it was reduced to the verge of ruin. The
kingdom was engaged in a quarrel truely national, and
commenced a nece&s;&s;ary war on national principles; but
that war was &s;tarved, and the chief &s;trength of the nation
transferred to the continent of Europe, in order to main|tain
an unnece&s;&s;ary war, in favour of a family who&s;e pride
and ambition can be equalled by nothing but its in&s;olence
and ingratitude. While the &s;trength of the nation was
thus exerted abroad for the &s;upport of worthle&s;s allies,
and a dangerous rebellion raged in the bowels of the king|dom,
the &s;overeign was in&s;ulted by his mini&s;ters, who de|&s;erted
his &s;ervice at that critical juncture, and refu&s;ed to
re&s;ume their functions, until he had truckled to their
petulant humour, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a favourite &s;ervant, of
who&s;e &s;uperior talents they were meanly jealous. Such
an unprecedented &s;ece&s;&s;ion at any time would have merited
<PB N="290" REF="295">
the imputation of in&s;olence; but at that period, when
their &s;overeign was perplexed and embarra&s;&s;ed by a variety
of dangers and difficulties; when his crown, and even
his life, was at &s;take, to throw up their places, abandon
his councils, and, as far as in them lay, detach them&s;elves
from his fortune, was a &s;tep &s;o likely to aggravate the
di&s;order of the nation, &s;o big with cruelty, ingratitude,
and &s;edition, that it &s;eems to de&s;erve an appellation which,
however, we do not think proper to be&s;tow. An inglo|rious
war was &s;ucceeded by an ignominious peace, which
proved of &s;hort duration; yet in this interval the Engli&s;h
nation exhibited &s;uch a proof of commercial opulence, as
a&s;toni&s;hed all Europe. At the clo&s;e of a war which had
drained it of &s;o much trea&s;ure, and increa&s;ed the public
debt to an enormous burthen, it acquie&s;ced under &s;uch a
reduction of intere&s;t as one would hardly think the mini|&s;try
dur&s;t have propo&s;ed, even before one half of the na|tional
debt was contracted. A much more unpopular &s;tep
was a law that pa&s;&s;ed for naturalizing the Jews&mdash;a law &s;o
odious to the people in general, that it was &s;oon repealed,
at the reque&s;t of that mini&s;ter by whom it had been chiefly
patroni&s;ed. An ill-concerted peace was in a little time
productive of fre&s;h ho&s;tilities, and another war with France,
which Britain began to pro&s;ecute under unfavourable au|&s;pices.
Then the whole political &s;y&s;tem of Germany was
inverted. The King of England abandoned the intere&s;t
of that hou&s;e which he had in the former war &s;o warmly
e&s;pou&s;ed, and took into his bo&s;om a prince whom he had
formerly con&s;idered as his inveterate enemy. The unpro|pitious
beginning of this war again&s;t France being im|puted
to the mi&s;conduct of the admini&s;tration, excited
&s;uch a ferment among the people, as &s;eemed to threaten a
dangerous in&s;urrection. Every part of the kingdom re|&s;ounded
with the voice of di&s;&s;atisfaction, which did not
even re&s;pect the throne. The King found him&s;elf obliged
to accept of a mini&s;ter pre&s;ented by the people, and
this mea&s;ure was attended with con&s;equences as favourable
as his wi&s;h could form. From that in&s;tant all clamour
<PB N="291" REF="296">
was hu&s;hed; all oppo&s;ition cea&s;ed. The enterpri&s;ing
&s;pirit of the new mini&s;ter &s;eemed to diffu&s;e it&s;elf through
all the operations of the war; and conque&s;t every where
attended the efforts of the Briti&s;h arms. Now appeared
the fallacy of tho&s;e maxims, and the fal&s;ehood of tho&s;e
a&s;&s;ertions, by which former mini&s;ters had e&s;tabli&s;hed and
endeavoured to excu&s;e the practices of corruption. The
&s;uppo&s;ed di&s;affection, which had been in&s;i&s;ted on as the
&s;ource of parliamentary oppo&s;ition, now entirely va|ni&s;hed;
nor was it found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;ini&s;ter means
for &s;ecuring a majority, in order to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es
of the admini&s;tration. England, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw a
mini&s;ter of &s;tate in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of popularity. Under
the au&s;pices of this mini&s;ter, it &s;aw a national militia
formed, and trained to di&s;cipline by the invincible &s;pirit
of a few patriots, who pur&s;ued this &s;alutary mea&s;ure in
the face of unwearied oppo&s;ition, di&s;couraged by the jea|lou&s;ly
of a court, and ridiculed by all the venal retainers to
a &s;tanding army. Under his mini&s;try it &s;aw the military
genius of Great-Britain revive, and &s;hine with redoubled
lu&s;tre; it &s;aw her intere&s;t and glory coincide, and an im|men&s;e
extent of country added by conque&s;t to her domi|nions.
The people, confiding in the integrity and abili|ties
of their own mini&s;ter, and elevated by the repeated
&s;ounds of triumph, became enamoured of the war, and
granted &s;uch liberal &s;ub&s;idies for its &s;upport, as no other
mini&s;ter would have pre&s;umed to a&s;k, as no other nation
believed they could afford. Nor did they murmur at
&s;eeing great part of their trea&s;ure diverted into foreign
channels; nor did they &s;eem to be&s;tow a &s;erious thought
on the accumulating load of the national debt, which al|ready
exceeded the immen&s;e &s;um of one hundred mil|lions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In a word, they were intoxicated with victory;
and as the King happened to die in the mid&s;t of their tran|&s;ports
occa&s;ioned by the final conque&s;t of Canada, their
good humour garni&s;hed his character with a prodigality of
encomiums. A thou&s;and pens were drawn to paint the
<PB N="292" REF="297">
beauties and &s;ublimity of his character, in poetry as well
as pro&s;e. They extolled him above Alexander in courage
and heroi&s;m, above Augu&s;tus in liberality, Titus in
clemency, Antoninus in piety and benevolence, Solomon
in wi&s;dom, and St. Edward in devotion. Such hyper|bolica
eulogiums &s;erved only to throw a ridicule upon a
character, which was otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable. The two
univer&s;ities vied with each other in lamenting his death,
and each publi&s;hed a huge collection of elegies on the
&s;ubject: nor did they fail to exalt his prai&s;e, with the
warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of affection and regret, in the com|pliments
of condolance and congratulation which they
pre&s;ented to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The &s;ame panegyrick and
pathos appeared in all the addre&s;&s;es with which every
other community in the kingdom approached the throne
of our pre&s;ent &s;overeign; in&s;omuch, that we may venture
to &s;ay, no prince was ever more popular at the time of his
decea&s;e. The Engli&s;h are naturally warm and impetu|ous;
and, in generous natures, affection is as apt as any
other pa&s;&s;ion to run riot. The &s;udden death of the King
was lamented as a national misfortune by many, who
felt a truely filial affection for their country; not that
they implicitly &s;ub&s;cribed to all the exaggerated prai&s;e
which had been &s;o liberally poured forth on his charac|ter;
but becau&s;e the nation was deprived of him at a criti|cal
juncture, while involved in a dangerous and expen&s;ive
war, of which he had been per&s;onally the chief mover
and &s;upport. They knew the burthen of royalty de|volved
upon a young prince, who, though heir apparent
to the crown, and already arrived at years of maturity,
had never been admitted to any &s;hare of the admini&s;tration,
nor made acquainted with any &s;chemes or &s;ecrets of &s;tate.
The real character of the new king was very little known
to the generality of the nation. They dreaded an abrupt
change of mea&s;ures, which might have rendered u&s;ele&s;s all
the advantages obtained in the cour&s;e of the war. As
they were ignorant of his connexions, they dreaded a re|volution
in the mini&s;try, which might fill the kingdom
<PB N="293" REF="298">
with clamour and confu&s;ion. But the greate&s;t &s;hock occa|&s;ioned
by his decea&s;e was undoubtedly among our allies and
fellow-&s;ubjects in Germany, who &s;aw them&s;elves &s;uddenly
deprived of their &s;ole prop and patron, at a time when
they could not pretend, of them&s;elves, to make head
again&s;t the numerous enemies by whom they were &s;ur|rounded.
But all the&s;e doubts and apprehen&s;ions va|ni&s;hed
like mi&s;ts before the ri&s;ing &s;un; and the people of
Great-Britain enjoyed the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of &s;eeing
their lo&s;s repaired in &s;uch a manner as mu&s;t have amply
fulfilled the mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;h of every friend to his
country.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The commerce of Great-Britain continued to
increa&s;e during the whole cour&s;e of this reign; but this
increa&s;e was not the effect of extraordinary encourage|ment.
On the contrary, the nece&s;&s;ities of government,
the growing expen&s;es of the nation, and the continual
augmentation of the publick debt, obliged the legi&s;lature
to hamper trade with manifold and grievous impo&s;itions:
its increa&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t have been owing to the natu|ral
progre&s;s of indu&s;try and adventure extending them|&s;elves
to that farthe&s;t line or limit beyond which they will
not be able to advance: when the tide of traffick has
&s;lowed to its highe&s;t mark, it will then begin to recede in
a gradual ebb, until it is &s;hrunk within the narrow limits
of its original channel. War, which naturally impedes
the traffick of other nations, had opened new &s;ources
to the merchants of Great-Britain: the &s;uperiority of her
naval power had cru&s;hed the navigation of France, her
great rival in commerce, &s;o that &s;he now &s;upplied, on her
own terms, all tho&s;e foreign markets, at which, in time of
peace, &s;he was under&s;old by that dangerous competitor.
Thus her trade was augmented to a &s;urpri&s;ing pitch; and
this great augmentation alone enabled her to maintain the
war at &s;uch an enormous expen&s;e. As this advantage will
cea&s;e when the French are at liberty to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their
commerce, and pro&s;ecute it without mole&s;tation, it would
be for the intere&s;t of Great-Britain to be at continual
variance with that re&s;tle&s;s neighbour, provided the con|te&s;t
<PB N="294" REF="299">
could be limited to the operations of a &s;ea-war, in
which England would be always invincible and victo|rious.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The powers of the human mind were freely
and fully exerci&s;ed in this reign. Con&s;iderable progre&s;s
was made in mathematicks and a&s;tronomy by divers indi|viduals;
among whom we number Sander&s;on, Bradley,
Maclaurin, Smith, and the two Simp&s;ons. Natural phi|lo&s;ophy
became a general &s;tudy, and the new doctrine of
electricity grew into fa&s;hion. Different methods were
di&s;covered for rendering &s;ea-water potable and &s;weet; and
divers u&s;eful hints were communicated to the publick by
the learned Doctor Stephen Hales, who directed all his
re&s;earches and experiments to the benefit of &s;ociety. The
&s;tudy of alchemy no longer prevailed; but the art of che|mi&s;try
was perfectly under&s;tood, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly applied
to the purpo&s;es of &s;ophi&s;tication. The clergy of Great-Britain
were generally learned, pious, and exemplary.
Sherlock, Hoadley, Secker, and Conybeare were pro|moted
to the fir&s;t dignities of the church. Warburton,
who had long &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf by the &s;trength and bold|ne&s;s
of his genius, his exten&s;ive capacity, and profound
erudition, at length obtained the mitre. But the&s;e pro|motions
were granted to rea&s;ons of &s;tate convenience,
and per&s;onal intere&s;t, rather than as rewards of ex|traordinary
merit. Many other eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of worth
and learning were totally overlooked. Nor was eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
merit confined to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Many
in&s;tances of extraordinary genius, unaffected piety, and
univer&s;al moderation, appeared among the di&s;&s;enting mini|&s;ters
of Great-Britain and Ireland: among the&s;e we par|ticulari&s;e
the elegant, the primitive Fo&s;ter; the learned,
ingenious, and penetrating Leland.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The progre&s;s of rea&s;on, and free cultivation
of the human mind, had not, however, entirely bani&s;hed
tho&s;e ridiculous &s;ects and &s;chi&s;ms of which the kingdom
had been formerly &s;o productive. Impo&s;ture and fanati|ci&s;m
&s;till hung upon the &s;kirts of religion. Weak minds
<PB N="295" REF="300">
were &s;educed by the delu&s;ions of a &s;uper&s;tition &s;tiled Me|thodi&s;m,
rai&s;ed upon the affectation of &s;uperior &s;anctity,
and maintained by preten&s;ions to divine illumination.
Many thou&s;ands in the lower ranks of life were infected
with this &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;m, by the unwearied endea|vours
of a few ob&s;cure preachers, &s;uch as Whitfield, and
the two We&s;tleys, who propagated their doctrines to the
mo&s;t remote corners of the Briti&s;h dominions, and found
means to lay the whole kingdom under contribution.
Fanatici&s;m al&s;o formed a league with fal&s;e philo&s;ophy.
One Hutchin&s;on, a vi&s;ionary, intoxicated with the fumes
of Rabbinical learning, pretended to deduce all demon|&s;tration
from Hebrew roots, and to confine all human
knowledge to the five books of Mo&s;es. His di&s;ciples be|came
numerous after his death. With the Methodi&s;ts,
they denied the merit of good works; and bitterly inveigh|ed
again&s;t Newton as an ignorant pretender, who had pre|&s;umed
to &s;et up his own ridiculous chimaeras in oppo&s;ition
to the &s;acred philo&s;ophy of the Pentateuch. But the mo&s;t
extraordinary &s;ect which di&s;tingui&s;hed this reign was that
of the Moravians, or Hernhutters, imported from Ger|many
by Count Zinzendorf, who might have been termed
the Melchizedeck of his followers, ina&s;much as he a&s;|&s;umed
among them the threefold character of prophet,
prie&s;t, and king. They could not be &s;o properly &s;tiled a
&s;ect, as the di&s;ciples of an original, who had invented a
new &s;y&s;tem of religion. Their chief adoration was paid
to the Second Per&s;on in the Trinity: the Fir&s;t they treat|ed
with the mo&s;t &s;hocking neglect. Some of their tenets
were bla&s;phemous, &s;ome indecent, and others ridiculou&s;ly
ab&s;urd. Their di&s;cipline was a &s;trange mixture of devo|tion
and impurity. Their exterior wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted of
hymns, prayers, and &s;ermons; the hymns extremely lu|dicrous,
and often indecent, alluding to the &s;ide-hole or
wound which Chri&s;t received from a &s;pear in his &s;ide
while he remained upon the cro&s;s. Their &s;ermons fre|quently
contained very gro&s;s incentives to the work of
propagation. Their private exerci&s;es are &s;aid to have
<PB N="296" REF="301">
abounded with &s;uch rites and my&s;teries as we cannot ex|plain
with any regard to decorum. They profe&s;&s;ed a
community of goods, and were governed as one fami|ly,
in temporals as well as &s;pirituals, by a council, or
kind of pre&s;bytery, in which the count, as their ordi|nary,
pre&s;ided. In ca&s;es of doubt, or great con&s;equence,
the&s;e pretended to con&s;ult the Saviour, and to decide from
immediate in&s;piration; &s;o that they boa&s;ted of being
under the immediate direction of a Theocracy; though,
in fact, they were &s;laves to the mo&s;t dangerous kind of
de&s;poti&s;m: for as often as any individual of the com|munity
pretended to think for him&s;elf, or differ in
opinion from the ordinary and his band of a&s;&s;ociates,
the oracle decreed that he &s;hould be in&s;tantly &s;ent upon
the mi&s;&s;ion which they had fixed in Greenland, or to the
colony they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in Penn&s;ylvania. As the&s;e re|ligioni&s;ts
con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of manufacturers, who appear|ed
very &s;ober, orderly, and indu&s;trious; and their chief
declared his intention of pro&s;ecuting works of publick
emolument, they obtained a &s;ettlement under a parlia|mentary
&s;anction in England, where they &s;oon made a
con&s;iderable number of pro&s;elytes, before their princi|ples
were fully di&s;covered and explained.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Many ingenious treati&s;es on metaphy &s;icks and
morality appeared in the cour&s;e of this reign, and a philo|&s;ophical
&s;pirit of enquiry di&s;&s;u&s;ed it&s;elf to the farthe&s;t ex|tremities
of the united kingdom. Though few di&s;coveries
of importance were made in medicine, yet that art was
well under&s;tood in all its different branches, and many of
its profe&s;&s;ors di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in other provinces of
literature. Be&s;ides the medical e&s;&s;ays of London and
Edinburgh, the phy&s;ician's library was enriched with many
u&s;eful modern productions; with the works of the cla&s;&s;ical
Friend, the elegant Mead, the accurate $$uxham, and the
philo&s;ophical Pringle. The art of midwifery was eluci|dated
by &s;cience, reduced to &s;ixed principles, and almo&s;t
wholly con&s;igned into the hands of men practitioners.
The re&s;earches of anatomy were pro&s;ecuted to &s;ome
curious di&s;coveries, by the ingenuity and dexterity of a
<PB N="297" REF="302">
Hunter and a Monro.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIV. 1760.</NOTE> The numerous ho&s;pitals in Lon|don
contributed to the improvement of &s;urgery, which was
brought to perfection under the au&s;pices of a Che&s;elden
and a Sharpe. The advantages of agriculture, which had
long flouri&s;hed in England, extended them&s;elves gradual|ly
to the mo&s;t remote and barren provinces of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The mechanick powers were well under|&s;tood,
and judiciou&s;ly applied to many u&s;eful machines of
nece&s;&s;ity and convenience. The mechanical arts had
attained to all that perfection which they were capable of
acquiring; but the avarice and oppre&s;&s;ion of contractors
obliged the handicraft&s;man to exert his ingenuity, not in
&s;ini&s;hing his work well, but in affording it cheap; in pur|cha&s;ing
bad materials, and performing his ta&s;k in a hurry;
in concealing flaws, &s;ub&s;tituting &s;how for &s;olidity, and &s;a|crificing
reputation to the thir&s;t of lucre. Thus, many of
the Engli&s;h manufactures, being found &s;light and un&s;er|viceable,
grew into di&s;credit abroad; thus the art of pro|ducing
them more perfect may in time be totally lo&s;t at
home. The cloths now made in England are inferior in
texture and fabrick to tho&s;e which were manufactured in
the beginning of the century; and the &s;ame judgment
may be pronounced upon almo&s;t every article of hard|ware.
The razors, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, hatchets, &s;words,
and other edge-uten&s;ils, prepared for exportation, are
generally ill-tempered, half fini&s;hed, &s;lawed or brittle;
and the mu&s;kets, which are &s;old for &s;even or eight &s;hil|lings
a-piece to the exporter, &s;o $arel$&s;ly and uncon&s;ci|entiou&s;ly
prepared, that they cannot be u&s;ed without
imminent danger of mutilation; accordingly, one hardly
meets with a negro man upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, in
the neighbourhood of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, who has
not been wounded or maimed in &s;ome member, by the
bur&s;ting of the Engli&s;h fire-arms. The advantages of
this traffick, carried on at the expence of character and
humanity, will naturally cea&s;e, whenever tho&s;e Africans
can be &s;upplied more hone&s;tly by the traders of any
other nation.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="303">
&sect; XXVIII. Genius in writing &s;pontaneou&s;ly aro&s;e, and
though neglected by the great, flouri&s;hed under the cul|ture
of a publick which had preten&s;ions to ta&s;te, and piqued
it&s;elf on encouraging literary merit. Swift and Pope we
have mentioned on another occa&s;ion. Young &s;till &s;ur|vived,
a venerable monument of poetical talents. Thom|&s;on,
the poet of the &s;ea&s;ons, di&s;played a luxuriancy of
genius in de&s;cribing the beauties of nature. Aken&s;ide
and Arm&s;trong excelled in didactick poetry. Even the
Epopoea did not di&s;dain an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, but appeared to
advantage in the Leonidas of Glover, and the Epigoniad of
Wilkie. The publick acknowledged a con&s;iderable &s;hare
of dramatick merit in the tragedies of Young, Mallet,
Home, and &s;ome other le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed authors. Very
few regular comedies, during this period, were exhibited on
the Engli&s;h theatre, which, however, produced many le&s;s
laboured pieces, abounding with &s;atire, wit, and humour.
The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band of Cibber, and Su&s;picious Hu&s;band
of Hoadly, are the only comedies of this age that bid fair
for reaching po&s;terity. The exhibitions of the &s;tage were
improved to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite entertainment by the ta|lents
and management of Garrick, who greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
all his predece&s;&s;ors of this, and perhaps every other nation,
in his genius for acting; in the &s;weetne&s;s and variety of
his tones; the irre&s;i&s;tible magick of his eye; the fire and
vivacity of his action, the elegance of attitude, and the
whole pathos of expre&s;&s;ion. Quin excelled in dignity and
declamation, as well as in exhibiting &s;ome characters of
humour, equally exqui&s;ite and peculiar. Mrs. Cibber
breathed the whole &s;oul of female tenderne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion,
and Mrs. Pritchard di&s;played all the dignity of di&s;tre&s;s.
That Great-Britain was not barren of poets at this pe|riod
appears from the detached performances of John&s;on,
Ma&s;on, Gray, the two Whiteheads, and the two War|tons,
be&s;ides a great number of other bards, who have
&s;ported in lyrick poetry, and acquired the applau&s;e of
their fellow citizens. Candidates for literary fame appeared
even in the higher &s;phere of life, embelli&s;hed by the ner|vous
<PB N="299" REF="304">
&s;tile, &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, and exten&s;ive erudition of a
Corke, by the delicate ta&s;te, the poli&s;hed mu&s;e, and ten|der
feelings of a Lyttelton. King &s;hone unrivalled in
Roman eloquence. Even the female &s;ex di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their ta&s;te and ingenuity. Mi&s;s Carter ri|valled
the celebrated Dacier in learning and critical know|ledge:
Mrs. Lennox &s;ignalized her&s;elf by many &s;ucce&s;s|ful
efforts of genius, both in poetry and pro&s;e; and Mi&s;s
Reid excelled the celebrated Ro&s;alba in portrait-painting,
both in miniature and at large, in oil, as well as in cray|ons.
The genius of Cervantes was transfu&s;ed into the
novels of Fielding, who painted the characters, and ri|diculed
the follies of life with equal &s;trength, humour,
and propriety. The field of hi&s;tory and biography was
cultivated by many writers of ability, among whom we
di&s;tingui&s;h the copious Guthrie, the circum&s;tantial Ralph,
the laborious Carte, the learned and elegant Robert&s;on,
and above all the ingenious, penetrating, and compre|hen&s;ive
Hume, whom we rank among the fir&s;t writers of
the age, both as an hi&s;torian and philo&s;opher. Nor let us
forget the merit con&s;picuous in the works of Campbell,
remarkable for candour, intelligence, and preci&s;ion.
John&s;on, inferior to none in philo&s;ophy, philology, poetry,
and cla&s;&s;ical learning, &s;tands foremo&s;t as an e&s;&s;ayi&s;t, ju&s;tly
admired for the dignity, &s;trength, and variety of his &s;tile,
as well as for the agreeable manner in which he inve&s;ti|gates
the human heart, tracing every intere&s;ting emotion,
and opening all the &s;ources of morality. The laudable
aim of inli&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions on the &s;ide of virtue was &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
pur&s;ued by Richard&s;on, in his Pamela, Clari&s;&s;a,
and Grandi&s;on; a &s;pecies of writing equally new and
extraordinary, where mingled with much &s;uperluity, we
find a &s;ublime &s;y&s;tem of ethicks, an amazing knowledge
and command of human nature. Many of the Greek and
Roman cla&s;&s;icks made their appearance in Engli&s;h tran|&s;lations,
which were favourably received as works of m$rit;
among the&s;e we place, after Pope's Homer, Virgil by P$tt
and Warton, Horace by Francis, Polybius by Hamp$on,
and Sophocles by Francklin. The war introduced a
<PB N="300" REF="305">
variety of military treati&s;es, chiefly tran&s;lated from the
French language; and a free country, like Great-Britain,
will always abound with political tracts and lucubrations.
Every literary production of merit, calculated for amu&s;e|ment
or in&s;truction, that appeared in any country or lan|guage
of Chri&s;tendom was immediately imported, and
naturali&s;ed among the Engli&s;h people. Never was the
pur&s;uit after knowledge &s;o univer&s;al, or literary merit more
regarded, than at this juncture by the body of the Briti&s;h
nation; but it was honoured by no attention from the
throne, and little indulgence did it reap from the liberality
of particular patrons. The reign of Queen Anne was
propitious to the fortunes of Swift and Pope, who lived in
all the happy pride of independence. Young, &s;eque&s;tered
from courts and preferment, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a moderate benefice
in the country, and employed his time in a con&s;cientious
di&s;charge of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions. Thom&s;on, with
the mo&s;t benevolent heart that ever warmed the human
brea&s;t, maintained a perpetual war with the difficulties of
a narrow fortune. He enjoyed a place in Chancery by the
bounty of Lord Talbot, of which he was dive&s;ted by the
&s;ucceeding chancellor. He afterwards enjoyed a &s;mall
pen&s;ion from Frederick Prince of Wales, which was
withdrawn in the &s;equel. About two years before his
death, he obtained, by the intere&s;t of his friend Lord
Lyttelton, a comfortable place; but he did not live to
ta&s;te the ble&s;&s;ing of ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and died in debt<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">However he was neglected when living, his memory has been honoured with peculiar marks of publick regard, in an ample &s;ub&s;cription for a new edition of his work$, the profit a to be employed in erecting a monument in his &s;ame in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey; a &s;ub&s;cription to which his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King George III. has liberally contributed. The remaining &s;urplus was di&s;|tributed among his poor relations.</NOTE>
None of the re&s;t whom we have named enjoyed any &s;hare
of the royal bounty, except W. Whitehead, who &s;uc|ceeded
to the place of laureat at the death of Cibber; and
&s;ome of them, who&s;e merit was the mo&s;t univer&s;ally ac|knowledged,
remained expo&s;ed to all the &s;torms of indi|gence,
and all the &s;tings of mortification. While the
<PB N="301" REF="306">
Queen lived, &s;ome countenance was given to learning.
She conver&s;ed with Newton, and corre&s;ponded with Leib|$nitz.
She took pains to acquire popularity: the royal fa|mily,
on certain days, dined in publick, for the &s;atisfaction
of the people: the court was animated with a freedom of
&s;pirit and vivacity, which rendered it at once brilliant and
agreeable. At her death that &s;pirit began to langui&s;h, and
a total &s;tagnation of gaiety and good-humour en&s;ued. It
was &s;ucceeded by a fullen calm, an ungracious re&s;erve,
and a &s;till rotation of in&s;ipid forms<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">George $word$. by his Queen Caro$ine, had two &s;ons and five daughters who $word$ the age of $word$.

<P>&sect; XXIX. England was not defective in other arts that
embelli&s;h and amu&s;e. Mu&s;ick became a fa&s;hionable &s;tudy,
and its profe&s;&s;ors were generally care&s;&s;ed by the publick.
An Italian opera was maintained at a great expen&s;e, and
well &s;upplied with foreign p$$formers. Private concerts
were in&s;tituted in every corner of the metropolis. The
compo&s;itions of Handel were univer&s;ally admired, and he
him&s;elf lived in affluence. It mu&s;t be owned at the &s;ame
time, that Geminiani was neglected, though his genius
commanded e&s;teem and veneration. Among the few
natives of England who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their
talents in this art, Green, Howard, Arne, and Boyce,
were the mo&s;t remarkable.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The Briti&s;h &s;oil, which had hitherto been
barren in the article of painting, now produced &s;ome ar|ti&s;ts
of extraordinary merit. Hogarth excelled all the
world in exhibiting the &s;cenes of ordinary life; in hu|mour,
character, and expre&s;&s;ion. Hayman became emi|nent
for hi&s;torical de&s;igns and conver&s;ation pieces. Rey|nolds
and Ram$$ay di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their &s;u|perior
merit in portraits; a branch that was &s;ucce&s;&s;fully
cultivated by many other Engli&s;h painters. Wootton
was famous for repre&s;enting live animals in general; Sey|mour
<PB N="302" REF="307">
for race-hor&s;es; Lambert, and the Smiths, for land$
&s;capes; and Scot for &s;ea-pieces. Several &s;pirited attempt$
were made on hi&s;torical &s;ubjects, but little progre&s;s wa$
made in the &s;ublime parts of painting. E&s;&s;ays of thi$
kind were di&s;couraged by a fal&s;e ta&s;te, founded upon $
reprobation of Briti&s;h genius. The art of engraving wa$
brought to perfection by Strange, and laudably practi&s;ed
by Grignion, Baron, Ravenet, and &s;everal other ma&s;ters
$ great improvements were made in mezzotinto, miniature,
and enamel. Many fair monuments of &s;culpture o$
&s;tatuary were rai&s;ed by Ry&s;brach, Roubilliac, and Wil|ton.
Architecture, which had been cheri&s;hed by the ele$gant
ta&s;te of a Burlington, &s;oon became a favourite &s;tudy
and many magnificent edifices were reared in different parts
of the kingdom. Ornaments were carved in wood, and
moulded in &s;tucco, with all the delicacy of execution, bu$
a pa&s;&s;ion for novelty had introduced into gradening$
building, and furniture, an ab&s;urd Chine&s;e ta&s;te, equally
void of beauty and convenience. Improvements in the
liberal and u&s;eful arts will doubtle&s;s be the con&s;equence o$
that encouragement given to merit by the &s;ociety in&s;tituted
for the&s;e purpo&s;es which we have de&s;cribed on another
occa&s;ion. As for the Royal Society, it &s;eems to have de|generated
in its re&s;earches, and to have had very little
&s;hare, for half a century at lea&s;t, in extending the influ|ence
of true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this reign with a detail of the forces
and fleets of Great-Britain, from whence the reader will
