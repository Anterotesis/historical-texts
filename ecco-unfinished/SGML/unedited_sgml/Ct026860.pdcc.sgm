<P>But You, My Lord, pur&s;ue a Nobler End, and have cho&s;e rather to &s;tain the Field with the Blood of Your Nation's Enemies, than encrea&s;e Your Fortune by ano|ther's Ruin; or expo&s;e Your Own to the Hazardous Die, a Re&s;olution worthy of Your Birth and Fortune: And that You may live to be a Terrour to our Foes, and a Succour to Your Country, in perfect Health and Happine&s;s, till Your Deare&s;t Friends con&s;ent to part with You, are the Humble Wi&s;hes of</P>

<L>And hovouring watch the Bubble's &s;ickly State;</L>
<L>The young fond Gambler covetous of more,</L>
<L>Like <HI>E&s;op</HI>'s Dog, lo&s;es his certain Store.</L>
<L>Then the Spunge &s;queez'd by all, grows dry,&mdash; And now</L>
<L>Compleatly Wretched, turns a Sharper too;</L>
<L>The&s;e Fools for want of Bubbles too, play Fair,</L>
<L>And Lo&s;e to one another on the Square;</L>
<L>So Whores the Wealth from numerous Culls they Glean,</L>
<L>Still Spend on Ballies, and grow poor again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Itch for day has likewi&s;e fatal been,</L>
<L>And more than <HI>Cupid</HI>, drawn the Ladies in,</L>
<L>A Thou&s;and Guineas for <HI>Ba&s;&s;et</HI> prevails,</L>
<L>A Bait when Ca&s;h runs low, that &s;eldom fails;</L>
<L>And when the Fair One can't the Debt defray,</L>
<L>In Sterling Coin, does Sterling Beauty pay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain we Labour to divert your Care,</L>
<L>Nor Song, nor Dance can Bribe your Pre&s;ence here,</L>
<L>You fly this Place like an Infectious Air.</L>
<L>To yonder happy Quarter of the Town,</L>
<L>You Croud; and your own Fav'rite Stage di&s;own;</L>
<L>We're like old Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, you love the Vice,</L>
<L>And hate us only 'cau&s;e we once did Plea&s;e,</L>
<L>Nor can we find how el&s;e 'tis we De&s;erve,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Tantalus</HI> 'mid&s;t Plenty, thus to Starve.</L>
