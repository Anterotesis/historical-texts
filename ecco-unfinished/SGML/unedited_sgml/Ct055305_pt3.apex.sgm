That after the fifth day of July, in the current year, any per&s;on might trade in any goods or wares, in which the quantity of gold, in any one &s;eparate piece, &s;hould not exceed two penny weights, or the quantity of &s;ilver be under five penny weights, without being liable to take out a licence for that purpo&s;e; but that, from the &s;ame date, every per&s;on &s;elling gold or &s;ilver plate, or goods in which gold or &s;ilver is manufactured, and the quantity of gold in one di&s;|tinct piece &s;hould amount to two ounces or up|wards, or the quantity of &s;ilver in one piece amounts to thirty ounces or upwards, &s;hould pay five pounds for an annual licence, in&s;tead of the forty &s;hillings formerly payable for this purpo&s;e; and that all pawnbrokers, refiners, and others, trading in gold and &s;ilver plate, &s;hould be obliged to take out this new annual licence: the &s;ums thus rai&s;ed to be applied to the &s;ame u&s;es and purpo&s;es, to which the &s;ums charged on licences by an act of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion were applicable. They re&s;olved, that the act to &s;ettle the trade to Africa, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of William III. for allowing, during a limited time, a drawback of the duties upon the exporta|tion of copper bars imported, with a provi&s;o con|tinued by &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acts, and now near ex|piring, &s;hould be further protracted; that &s;o much

of an act, pa&s;&s;ed in the eighth year of George I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> for encouraging the &s;ilk manufacture of the king|dom, as relates to this encouragement, and to taking off &s;everal duties on merchandize exported, &s;hould likewi&s;e be continued. They moreover voted the continuation of &s;o much of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd year of George II. for the better pre&s;ervation of his maje&s;ty's woods in America, as related to the premium upon ma&s;ts, yards, and bow&s;prits, tar, pitch, and turpentine. They re|&s;olved, that the act for encouraging the growth of coffee in the American plantations, and another for the more effectual &s;ecuring the duties on foreign-made &s;ail-cloth imported into the kingdom, &s;hould be continued. They determined, that the &s;ums remaining in the receipt of the Exchequer, di&s;|po&s;able by parliament, amounting to the &s;um of two hundred fifty-three thou&s;and three hundred and eighty-four pounds eleven pence, &s;hould be applied towards making good the &s;upply granted in this &s;e&s;&s;ion. They re&s;olved, that the duties payable upon raw &s;hort &s;ilk or capiton, and &s;ilk nubs or hu&s;ks, &s;hould, after the fifth day of July, cea&s;e and determine; but, in lieu thereof, that the &s;ame duties &s;hould be payed upon the importation of the&s;e articles, as were payed upon raw long &s;ilk imported, and applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Towards the pre&s;ent &s;upply they likewi&s;e allotted the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, repayed into the receipt of the Exchequer, being the &s;um which was granted in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, for enabling the king to fulfil his engagements with the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. For defraying the expence incurred by the addi|tional
<PB N="12" REF="110">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> &s;alaries granted to the judges, they impo&s;ed an additional &s;tamp-duty of &s;ix-pence upon every piece of vellum or parchment, or &s;heet or piece of paper, on which &s;hould be engro&s;&s;ed or written any affidavit u&s;ed in any court of law or equity at We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in the courts of the great &s;e&s;&s;ions in Wales, or county-palatine of Che&s;ter, except affidavits taken pur&s;uant to &s;everal acts made in the thirtieth and thirty-&s;econd years of the reign of Charles II. for burying in woollen; and except &s;uch affidavits as &s;hould be taken before the officers of the cu&s;toms, or any ju&s;tice of the peace, or commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by act of parliament for a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or levying aids or duties granted to his maje&s;ty, which affidavits &s;hould be taken by the &s;aid officers of the cu&s;toms, ju&s;tices, or commi&s;|&s;ioners, by virtue of their authority, as ju&s;tices of the peace, or commi&s;&s;ioners, re&s;pectively. This additional &s;tamp-duty was charged on all affidavits read and filed in the afore&s;aid courts of judicature; on all paper and vellum u&s;ed for common bail, rules, or orders, copies of rules or orders, original writs, &s;ubpoenas, proce&s;s or mandate that &s;hould i&s;&s;ue from or pa&s;s the &s;eals of any of the courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter, courts of the great &s;e&s;&s;ions in Wales, courts in the counties-palatine, or any other court whatever holding plea, where the debt or damage amounts to forty &s;hillings or above, or the thing demanded is of that value; excepting, however, writs of covenant for levying fines, writs of entry for &s;uffering common recoveries, and writs of ha|beas corpus. They moreover e&s;tabli&s;hed an addi|tional &s;tamp-duty of one penny upon every &s;heet of paper or piece of vellum, u&s;ed for depo&s;itions taken
<PB N="13" REF="120">
in the court of Chancery, or other court of equity<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> at We&s;tmin&s;ter, (except the paper-draughts of de|po&s;itions taken by virtue of any commi&s;&s;ion before they are engro&s;&s;ed) for copies of bills, an&s;wers, pleas, demurrers, replications, rejoinders, interro|gatories, depo&s;itions, or other proceedings what&s;o|ever, in this or any other court of judicature in England and Wales. The augmentation of &s;ala|ries granted to the judges in Scotland was charged upon the duties and revenues collected in that part of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Finally, the commons re&s;olved, that the &s;um of two millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out of the &s;inking-fund towards the &s;upply of the current year; and one million rai&s;ed by exchequer-bills, chargeable on the fir&s;t aids to be granted in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament.</P>
<P>On the whole, the provi&s;ion made by the com|mittee of ways and means amounted to twelve mil|lions nine hundred ninety-one thou&s;and two hun|dred and thirty-nine pounds; &s;o that there was an exce&s;s of two hundred twenty-nine thou&s;and nine hundred and twenty-eight pounds one &s;hilling and four pence, be&s;ides the uncertain &s;um ari&s;ing from the overplus of what had been voted for the main|tenance and cloathing of the militia. Nearly two millions of this &s;upply was granted for the purpo&s;e of carrying on the war in Germany, exclu&s;ive of the extraordinary expence incurred by tran&s;porting and recruiting the national troops of Great Britain in actual &s;ervice upon that continent, train of ar|tillery, convoys, forage, ho&s;pitals, and other con|tingencies of a compaign. Indeed, the whole ex|pence
<PB N="14" REF="130">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of maintaining the&s;e troops ought to be placed to the account of the German war, ina&s;much as their ab&s;ence from Great Britain laid the nation under the nece&s;&s;ity of retaining the militia in ac|tual &s;ervice. The bills founded on the&s;e re&s;olu|tions were pa&s;&s;ed with great unanimity, and re|ceived the &s;anction of the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's me&s;&s;age to the com|mons.</NOTE> The commons were &s;till employed in delibera|tions on ways and means on the twenty &s;econd day of May, when Mr. &s;ecretary Pitt communicated to them a me&s;&s;age from the king, couched in the&s;e terms: "His maje&s;ty, relying on the experienced zeal and affection of his faithful commons, and con&s;idering that, in this critical conjuncture, emer|gencies may ari&s;e, which may be of the utmo&s;t im|portance, and be attended with the mo&s;t pernici|ous con&s;equences, if proper means &s;hould not im|mediately be applied to prevent or defeat them, is de&s;irous that this hou&s;e will enable him to defray any extraordinary expences of the war, incurred, or to be incurred, for the &s;ervice of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine, and to take all &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;appoint or defeat any enterprizes or de&s;igns of his enemies, and as the exigencies of affairs may require."</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age being read, a motion was made, and agreed to nemine contradicente, that it &s;hould be referred to the committee, who forthwith formed upon it the re&s;olution, whereby one million was granted, to be rai&s;ed by loans, or exchequer-bills, chargeable on the fir&s;t aids that &s;hould be given in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. This produced a bill en|abling his maje&s;ty to rai&s;e the &s;um of one million, for the u&s;es and purpo&s;es therein mentioned, com|prehending

a clau&s;e, allowing the bank of England<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to advance, on the credit of the loan therein men|tioned, any &s;um not exceeding a million, notwith|&s;tanding the act of the fifth and &s;ixth years in the reign of William and Mary, by which the Bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bills re|lating to the di&s;til|lery and exporta|tion of corn.</NOTE> The bills relating &s;olely to the &s;upply being di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed and expedited, the hou&s;e proceeded as u&s;ual to enact other laws for the advantage of the com|munity. Petitions having been pre&s;ented by the cities of Bri&s;tol and New Sarum, alledging, that &s;ince the laws prohibiting the making of low wines and &s;pirits from grain, meal, and flour, had been in force, the commonalty appeared more &s;ober, healthy, and indu&s;trious; repre&s;enting the ill con|&s;equences which they apprehended would attend the repeal of the&s;e laws, and therefore praying their continuance; a committee of the whole hou&s;e re|&s;olved, that the prohibition to export corn &s;hould be continued to the twenty-fourth day of Decem|ber, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine; &s;ubject, neverthele&s;s, to &s;uch provi&s;ions for &s;hortening the &s;aid term of its continuance as &s;hould therefore be made by any act of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, or by his maje&s;ty with the advice of his privy coun|cil, during the rece&s;s of parliament; that the act for di&s;continuing the duties upon corn and flour imported, or brought in as prize, was not proper to be further continued; and that the prohibition to make low wines or &s;pirits from any &s;ort of grain, meal, or flour, &s;hould be continued to the twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> their not being allowed either to export it, or make it into malt for exportation: they therefore prayed this prohibition might be removed, or they the petitioners indulged with &s;ome other kind of relief. Although this remon&s;trance was duly con&s;idered, the bill pa&s;&s;ed with the amendments, becau&s;e of the provi&s;o, by which his maje&s;ty in council was im|powered to &s;horten the date of the prohibition, with re&s;pect to the exportation of corn, during the rece&s;s of parliament: but the temporary re&s;traint laid upon di&s;tillation was made ab&s;olute, without any &s;uch condition, to the no &s;mall di&s;appointment and mortification of the di&s;tillers, who had &s;pared no pains and expence, by private &s;olicitation and &s;trenuous di&s;pute in the public papers, to recom|mend their cau&s;e to the favour of the community.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argu|ments u&s;ed for and a|gain&s;t the malt-di&s;|tillery.</NOTE> They urged, that malt-&s;pirits, when u&s;ed in mo|deration, far from being prejudicial to the health of individuals, were, in many damp and mar&s;hy parts of the kingdom, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for pre|&s;erving the field labourers from agues, and other di&s;tempers produced by the cold and moi&s;ture of the climate; that if they were debarred the u&s;e of malt-&s;pirits, they would have recour&s;e to French brandy, with which, as they generally re&s;ided near the &s;ea coa&s;t, the &s;mugglers would provide them almo&s;t as cheap as the malt-&s;pirits could be afford|ed: thus the increa&s;ed con&s;umption of French &s;pirit would drain the nation of ready money to a con&s;iderable amount, and prejudice the king's re|venue in the &s;ame proportion.

They affirmed, that, from the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of malt-&s;pirits, no good argument could be drawn again&s;t this branch of traffick, no more than again&s;t any other conveniency of life: that the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of common beer or ale was prejudicial to the health and morals of the people, yet no per&s;on ever thought of putting an end to the practice of brewing, in order to prevent the abu&s;e of brewed liquors. They urged, that in all parts of Great Britain there are &s;ome parcels of land that produce nothing to advantage, but a coar&s;e kind of barley called big, which, though neither fit for brewing or for baking, may never|thele&s;s be u&s;ed in the di&s;tillery, and is accordingly purcha&s;ed by tho&s;e concerned in this branch at &s;uch an encouraging price, as enables many farmers to pay a higher rent to their landlords than they could otherwi&s;e afford: that there are every year &s;ome parcels of all &s;orts of grain &s;o damaged by un&s;ea|&s;onable weather, or other accidents, as to be ren|dered

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> altogether unfit for bread or brewery, and would prove a very great misfortune to the farmer, if there was no di&s;tillery, for the u&s;e of which he could &s;ell this damaged commodity. They a&s;&s;erted, that malt-&s;pirits were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for pro|&s;ecuting &s;ome branches of foreign commerce, par|ticularly the trade to the coa&s;t of Africa, for which traffick no a&s;&s;ortment could be made up without a large quantity of geneva, of which the natives are &s;o fon$, that they will not traffick with any mer|chant who has not a con&s;iderable quantity, not only for &s;ale, but al&s;o for pre&s;ents to their chiefs and rulers: that the merchants of Great Britain mu&s;t either have this commodity of their own produce, or import it at a great national expence from Hol|land: that the charge of this importation, together with the duties payable upon it, &s;ome part of which is not to be drawn back on exportation; would render it impo&s;&s;ible for the traders to &s;ell it &s;o cheap on the coa&s;t of Africa as it might be &s;old by the Dutch, who are the great rivals of Great Britain in this branch of commerce.</P>
<P>To the&s;e arguments, all of which were plau&s;ible, and &s;ome of them unan&s;werable, it was replied, that the malt-&s;pirits might be con&s;idered as a fatal and bewitching poi&s;on, which had actually de|bauched the minds and enervated the bodies of the common people to a very deplorable degree; that, without entering further into a compari&s;on between the u&s;e and abu&s;e of the two liquors, beer and ge|neva, it would be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the u&s;e of beer and ale had produced none of tho&s;e dreadful effects which were the con&s;equences of drinking geneva; and &s;ince the prohibition of the

di&s;tillery of malt-&s;pirits had taken place, the com|mon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> people were become apparently more &s;ober, decent, healthy, and indu&s;trious: a circum&s;tance &s;ufficient to induce the legi&s;lature not only to inter|mit, but even totally to aboli&s;h the practice of di&s;|tillation, which has ever been productive of &s;uch intoxication, ri$t, di&s;order, and di&s;temper, among the lower cla&s;s of the people, as might be deemed the greate&s;t evils incident to a well-regulated com|monwealth. Their a&s;&s;ertion with re&s;pect to the coar&s;e kind of barley, called big, was contradicted as a deviation from truth, ina&s;much as it was u&s;ed in making malt, as well as in making bread: and, with re&s;pect to damaged corn, tho&s;e who under|&s;tood the nature of grain affirmed, that, if it was &s;poiled to &s;uch a degree as to be altogether unfit for either of the&s;e purpo&s;es, the di&s;tillers would not purcha&s;e it at &s;uch a price as would indemnify the farmer for the charge of thre&s;hing and carriage; for the di&s;tillers are very &s;en&s;ible, that their great|e&s;t profit is derived from their di&s;tilling the malt made from the be&s;t barley, &s;o that the increa&s;e of the produce far exceeded in proportion the advance of the price. It was not, however, an ea&s;y matter to prove that the di&s;tillation of malt-&s;pirits was not nece&s;&s;ary to an advantageous pro&s;ecution of the commerce on the coa&s;t of Guinea, as well as among the Indians in &s;ome parts of North America. Cer|tain it is, that in the&s;e branches of traffick the want of geneva may be &s;upplied by &s;pirits di&s;tilled from &s;ugars and mola&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>After all, it mu&s;t be owned, that the good and &s;alutary effects of the prohibition were vi&s;ible in every part of the kingdom, and no evil con&s;e|quences

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petition by the ju&s;tices of Norfolk.</NOTE> In the mean time, all &s;orts of grain continuing to fall in price, and great plenty appearing in every part of the kingdom, the ju&s;tices of the peace, and of the grand juries a&s;&s;embled at the general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace held for the county of Norfolk, compo&s;ed and pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons, in the beginning of February, a petition, repre&s;enting, that the weather proving unfavourable in the harve&s;t, great part of the bar|ley rai&s;ed in that county was much damaged, and rendered unfit for any other u&s;e than that of being made into malt for exportation; that, unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;peedily manufactured for that purpo&s;e, it would be intirely &s;poiled, and peri&s;h in the hands of the growers, a lo&s;s that mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ibly felt by the land owners: they therefore intreated, that leave might be given for the exportation of malt; and that they might be favoured with &s;uch farther relief, as to the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. In con&s;equence of this petition, the hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to deliberate upon the &s;ubject; and as it appeared, upon exami|nation, that the price of grain was reduced very low, and great abundance diffu&s;ed through the king|dom, they re&s;olved, that the continuance of that

A bill, being founded on the&s;e re&s;olutions, was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and underwent &s;everal amendments: a$ length, it was &s;ent with a new title to the lords, who pa&s;&s;ed it without further alteration, and then it obtained the royal &s;anction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the price of corn.</NOTE> The price of corn however, in the London-market ought not alone to determine the delibera|tions of the legi&s;lature on this important article. The ea&s;tern counties, containing more arable land than is to be found in the we&s;tern provinces, can ea&s;ily &s;upply the markets of the metropolis by &s;ea-carriage; whereas the dealers of that part of the kingdom will rather export their corn to Holland, even without a bounty, then convey it to any we&s;tern port in England, becau&s;e the navigation to Holland being &s;horter, and le&s;s dangerous, the freight and in&s;urance will be defrayed at a &s;mall expence. This being the ca&s;e, the London-market is often over-&s;tocked with grain, when the we&s;tern counties labour under a real &s;carcity. In order to remedy and remove this inconvenience, a law might be enacted, prohibiting the exportation of corn, except when the market-price throughout England remains at or under a certain &s;tandard or e&s;tabli&s;hed rate, and determining this rate by the medium price at which corn &s;hall have been &s;old for three market-days, at the chief weekly markets in two or three of the midland we&s;tern counties, where all &s;orts of corn have for &s;ome years borne
<PB N="24" REF="230">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the highe&s;t price. This expedient would oblige the dealers in corn, re&s;iding in the ea&s;tern divi&s;ions, to convey their grain to the we&s;tern ports rather than to Holland, notwith&s;tanding the greater ex|pence of the tran&s;portation, that the price of corn in tho&s;e midland counties &s;hould not ri&s;e &s;o high as to put a &s;top to the payment of the bounty, or the liberty of exporting. The expediency of &s;ome &s;uch regulation the reader will ea&s;ily conceive, when he is informed, that about the time when this bill was ordered to be brought in, the be&s;t wheat was &s;old at two &s;hillings per bu&s;hel in the county of Norfolk; whereas the &s;ame commodity was &s;old at that very period for three times the price in &s;ome parts of Wilt&s;hire. It may &s;o happen, that the be&s;t &s;ort of wheat &s;hall &s;ell in &s;ome midland we&s;tern counties at twelve &s;hillings per bu&s;hel, and all other &s;orts of grain dear in proportion; while, at the &s;ame time, the &s;ame kind of wheat &s;hall be &s;old for four &s;hillings in Norfolk, and all other &s;orts of grain proportionably cheap. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it would be extremely ab&s;urd to permit an exporta|tion from any port in the kingdom; and much more ridiculous &s;till to encourage the exportation, by a bounty, from the ports of Norfolk; yet this ca&s;e may happen, according to the law as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for the im|portation of &s;alted beef, &amp;c. from Ire|land, con|tinued.</NOTE> While this affair was under the deliberation of the committee, the commons unanimou&s;ly i&s;&s;ued an order for leave to bring in a bill to continue, for a limited time, the act of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, permitting the importation of &s;alted beef from Ireland into Great Britain, with an in&s;truction to receive a clau&s;e extending this permi&s;&s;ion to all &s;orts of &s;alted

From this clau&s;e it ap|pears, the burthen which the navigation of Great Britain incurs by the duty of &s;alt alone is computed to amount to thirteen per centum, on tho&s;e articles of commerce in which it is u&s;ed; con&s;equently the freight of all &s;hips victualled in this kingdom mu&s;t be proportionably increa&s;ed: therefore it is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, that the trade to Hamburgh, and other ports, &s;hould be carried on in foreign &s;hips,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> notwith&s;tanding the repeated endeavours of the parliament, was found &s;till incompleat, and in want of further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the legi&s;lature. His ma|je&s;ty having, by the chancellor of the Exchequer, recommended to the hou&s;e the making &s;uitable provi&s;ion for defraying the charges of the militia during the current year, the accounts of the ex|pence already incurred by this e&s;tabli&s;hment were referred to the committee of &s;upply, who, after having duly peru&s;ed them, re&s;olved, that ninety thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted on accompt, towards defraying the charges of pay and cloath|ing for the militia, from the la&s;t day of the la&s;t year to the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty, and for re|paying a &s;um advanced by the king for this &s;ervice. Leave was given to bring in one bill pur&s;uant to this re&s;olution; and another to enforce the execu|tion of the laws relating to the militia, remove cer|tain difficulties, and prevent the inconveniences, by which it might be attended. So intent were the majority on both &s;ides upon this national mea&s;ure, that they not only carried both bills to the throne, where they received the royal a&s;&s;ent; but they pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would give directions to his lieutenants of the &s;e|veral counties, ridings, and places in England, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence and attention for carry|ing into execution the &s;everal acts of parliament relating to the militia.</P>
<P>By this time all the individuals that con&s;tituted the repre&s;entatives of the people, except &s;uch as actually &s;erved in the army, were become very well di&s;po&s;ed towards this in&s;titution. Tho&s;e who

Yet how zealous &s;oever the legi&s;lature might be in pro|moting this in&s;titution, and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ucce&s;s with which many patriots exerted their en|deavours through different parts of the kingdom in rai&s;ing and di&s;ciplining the militia, it was found not only difficult, but almo&s;t impracticable to ex|ecute the intention of the parliament in &s;ome par|ticular counties, where the gentlemen were indo|lent and enervated, or in tho&s;e places where they looked upon their commander with contempt. Even Middle&s;ex it&s;elf, where the king re&s;ides, was one of the la&s;t counties in which the militia could be arrayed. In allu&s;ion to this backwardne&s;s, the preamble or fir&s;t clau&s;e in one of the pre&s;ent acts, imported that certain counties, ridings, and places in England, had made &s;ome progre&s;s in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the militia without compleating the &s;ame; and that in certain other counties little progre&s;s had been made therein, his maje&s;ty's lieutenants and the deputy lieutenants, and all others within &s;uch counties or di&s;tricts, were therefore &s;trictly required &s;peedily and diligently to put the&s;e acts in execu|tion. The truth is, &s;ome of the&s;e unwarlike com|manders failed through ignorance and inactivity; others gave or offered commi&s;&s;ions to &s;uch people as threw a ridicule and contempt upon the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment, and con&s;equently hindered many gentlemen of worth, &s;pirit, and capacity, from en|gaging in the &s;ervice.</P>

They enume|rated and explained the difficulties under which they laboured, in rai&s;ing and collecting the&s;e fines within their re&s;pective countries; particularly when the e&s;tate conveyed by fine, was no more than a right of rever&s;ion, in which ca&s;e they could not po&s;&s;ibly levy the po&s;t-fine, unle&s;s the purcha&s;er &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion within the term of the &s;he|riffalty, or pay it of his own free will, as they could not di&s;train while the lands were in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the donee.

Why the humanity of this law was confined to tho&s;e pri&s;oners only, who are not charged in execution with any debt exceed|ing one hundred pounds, cannot ea&s;ily be con|ceived. A man, who, through unavoidable mi&s;|fortunes, hath &s;unk from affluence to mi&s;ery and indigence, is generally a greater object of compa&s;|&s;ion than he who never knew the delicacies of life, nor ever enjoyed credit &s;ufficient to contract debts to any con&s;iderable amount: yet the latter is by this law intitled to his di&s;charge, or at lea&s;t to a maintenance in pri&s;on; while the former is left to &s;tarve in gaol, or undergo perpetual impri&s;onment amid&s;t all the horrors of mi&s;ery, if he owes above one hundred pounds to a revengeful and unrelent|ing creditor. Wherefore, in a country, the people of which ju&s;tly pique them&s;elves upon charity and benevolence, an unhappy fellow-citizen, reduced to a &s;tate of bankruptcy by unfore&s;een lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to a puni&s;hment, which, of all others, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t grievous to a free|born Briton, namely, the entire lo&s;s of liberty; a puni&s;hment which the mo&s;t flagrant crime can hard|ly

Wherefore the legi&s;lature &s;hould extend its huma|nity to tho&s;e only who are the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the benefit, becau&s;e the mo&s;t able to &s;truggle under misfortune? And wherefore many valuable indivi|duals &s;hould, for no guilt of their own, be not only ruined to them&s;elves, but lo&s;t to the community? are que&s;tions which we cannot re&s;olve to the &s;ati&s;|faction of the reader. Of all impri&s;oned debtors, tho&s;e who are confined for large &s;ums may be deemed the mo&s;t wretched and forlorn, becau&s;e they have generally fallen from a &s;phere of life where they had little acquaintance with nece&s;&s;ity, and were altogether ignorant of the arts by which the &s;everities of indigence are alleviated. On the other hand, tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s of mankind, who&s;e debts are &s;mall in proportion to the narrow|ne&s;s of their former credit, have not the &s;ame de|licate &s;eelings of calamity. They are inured to hard&s;hip, and accu&s;tomed to the labour of their hands, by which, even in a pri&s;on, they can earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Their rever&s;e of fortune is not &s;o great, nor the tran&s;ition &s;o affecting. Their &s;en&s;a|tions are not delicate; nor are they, like their bet|ters in misfortune, cut off from hope, which is the wretch's la&s;t comfort.

He &s;corns to execute the lowe&s;t of|fices of menial &s;ervice, particularly in attending tho&s;e who are the objects of contempt or abhor|rence: he is incapable of exerci&s;ing any mechanic art, which might afford a happy though a &s;canty independence. Shrunk within his di&s;mal cell, &s;ur|rounded by haggard poverty, and her gaunt at|tendants, hollow-eyed famine, &s;hivering cold, and wan di&s;ea&s;e, he wildly ca&s;ts his eyes around: he &s;ees the tender partner of his heart weeping in &s;ilent woe; he hears his helple&s;s babes clamorous for &s;u&s;tenance: he feels him&s;elf the importunate cravings of human nature, which he cannot &s;atisfy; and groans with all the complicated pangs of inter|nal angui&s;h, horror, and de&s;pair.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bills for the im|portation of Iri&s;h beef and tallow.</NOTE> Among other new mea&s;ures, a &s;ucce&s;sful attempt was made in favour of Ireland, by a bill, permitting the free importation of cattle from that kingdom for a limited time. This, however, was not car|ried through both hou&s;es without con&s;iderable op|po&s;ition, ari&s;ing from the particular intere&s;t of cer|tain countries and di&s;tricts in &s;everal parts of Great Britain, from whence petitions again&s;t the bill were tran&s;mitted to the commons. Divers artifices were al&s;o u&s;ed within doors to &s;addle the bill with &s;uch clau&s;es as might overcharge the &s;cheme, and ren|der it odious or alarming to the public: but the promoters of it, being aware of the de&s;ign, con|ducted it in &s;uch a manner as to fru&s;trate all their views, and convey it &s;afely to the throne, where it was enacted into a law.</P>
<P>The like &s;ucce&s;s attended another effort in be|half of our fellow-&s;ubjects of Ireland. The bill for the importation of Iri&s;h cattle was no &s;ooner or|dered to be brought in, than the hou&s;e proceeded to take into con&s;ideration the duties then payable on the importation of tallow from the &s;ame king|dom; and &s;everal witne&s;&s;es being examined, the committee agreed to a re&s;olution, that the&s;e duties &s;hould cea&s;e and determine for a limited time. A bill being formed accordingly, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition; though in the preced|ing &s;e&s;&s;ion a bill to the &s;ame purpo&s;e had mi&s;car|ried among the peers: a mi&s;carriage probably owing to their being unacquainted with the &s;enti|ments of his maje&s;ty, as &s;ome of the duties upon

By this new act the free importation of Iri&s;h tallow was permitted for the term of five years, before the ex|piration of which, the law, it is to be hoped, will be made perpetual. Indeed, it is not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ing that the importation of this commodity, from one part of the Briti&s;h dominions to another, &s;hould have been ever encumbered with a duty equal to a prohibition, con&s;idering what a nece&s;&s;ary article it is in &s;o many manufactures and mechani|cal employments.</P>

<P>The objections made without doors to this new law were the acce&s;&s;ion of pecuniary influence to the crown, by the creation of a new office and officers; whereas this duty might have been ea&s;ily collected and receiv|ed by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the land-tax already ap|pointed, and the incon&s;i&s;tency that appeared between the fifth and &s;eventh clau&s;es; in the former of the&s;e, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the land-tax were ve&s;ted with the power of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the perqui&s;ites of every of|fice within their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, independent

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act relat|ing to the duty upon plate.</NOTE> In the beginning of March petitions were of|fered to the hou&s;e by the merchants of Birming|ham in Warwick&s;hire and Sheffield in York&s;hire, &s;pecifying that the toy trade of the&s;e and many other towns con&s;i&s;ted generally of articles in which gold and &s;ilver might be &s;aid to be manufactured, though in &s;mall proportion, ina&s;much as the &s;ale of them depended upon &s;light ornaments of gold and &s;ilver: that by a clau&s;e pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;|&s;ion of parliament, obliging every per&s;on who &s;hould &s;ell goods or wares in which any gold or &s;ilver was manufactured, to take out an annual licence of forty &s;hillings, they the petitioners were laid under great difficulties and di&s;advantages: that not only the fir&s;t &s;eller, but every per&s;on through who&s;e hands the goods or wares pa&s;&s;ed to the con|&s;umer, was required to take out the &s;aid licence; they therefore reque&s;ted, that the hou&s;e would take the&s;e hard&s;hips and inequalities into con&s;ideration, and indulge them with rea&s;onable relief.</P>

<P>Though the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature in pa&s;&s;ing this new act was to favour the manufacturer of cutlery-ware and toys, it will hardly exempt any of the traders from the expence of a licence; to which, in all probability, they will rather &s;ubmit, than be re&s;tricted in the nature of their dealings, or run the ri&s;que of having di&s;putes and law-&s;uits with exci&s;emen, to be determined by the commi&s;|&s;ioners of the exci&s;e, or annually by the commi&s;|&s;ioners of appeal.</P>

This rigorous law may be attended with &s;ome inconvenience, and even prove ineffectual in excluding the French manufacture, ina&s;much as the fabrick of &s;ome Dutch and German lawns re|&s;embles that of the French manufacture &s;o nearly, that it is &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other. The only method by which they were formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed, was the dif|ferent manner of marking and package. But the French manufacturer can ea&s;ily counter&s;eit the manner of the Dutch or Germans in the&s;e particulars, and then &s;end his goods to &s;ome place in Holland and Flanders, from whence they may be imported into England, as the fa|brick of the&s;e countries. Perhaps the mo&s;t ef|fectual expedient for preventing the importation of French cambricks would be the granting a proper bounty on all home-made cambricks and lawns, payable on &s;ight of a certificate from an exci&s;e-man and two pari&s;h-officers who had &s;een the pieces, and mea&s;ured them before they were cut from the loom.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful bill which this &s;e&s;&s;ion pro|duced, was that relating to the augmentation of the &s;alaries of the judges in his maje&s;ty's &s;uperior courts of ju&s;tice. A motion having been made for an in&s;truction to the committee of &s;upply, to con&s;ider of the &s;aid augmentation, the chancellor of the Exchequer acquainted the hou&s;e that this augmentation was recommended to them by his maje&s;ty. Neverthele&s;s, the motion was oppo&s;ed, and a warm debate en&s;ued. At length, however,
<PB N="49" REF="480">
being carried in the affirmative, the committee<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> agreed to certain re&s;olutions, on which a bill was founded. While it remained under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, a motion was made for an in&s;truction to the com|mittee, that they &s;hould have power to receive a clau&s;e or clau&s;es for re&s;training the judges, compre|hended within the provi&s;ions of the bill, from re|ceiving any fee, gift, pre&s;ent, or entertainment, from any city, town, borough, or corporation, or from any &s;heriff, gaoler, or other officer, upon their &s;everal re&s;pective circuits, and from taking any gratuity from any office or officer of any of the courts of law. Another motion was made for a clau&s;e re&s;training &s;uch judges, barons, and ju&s;tices, as were comprehended within the provi&s;ions of the bill, from interfering, otherwi&s;e than by giving their own votes, in any election of members to &s;erve in parliament; but both the&s;e propo&s;als, being put to the vote, were carried in the negative. The&s;e two motions being over-ruled by the majo|rity, the bill underwent &s;ome amendments; and, having pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es in the ordinary cour&s;e, was enacted into a law by the royal &s;anction. With re&s;pect to the import of this act, it is no other than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;everal &s;tamp-duties, applied to the augmentation; and the appropria|tion of their produce in &s;uch a manner, that the crown cannot alter the application of the &s;ums thus granted in parliament. But, on this occa&s;ion, no attempt was made in favour of the indepen|dency of the judges, which &s;eems to have been in|vaded by a late interpretation of, or rather by a deviation from, the act of &s;ettlement: in which it is expre&s;sly ordained, that the commi&s;&s;ions of the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> judges &s;hould continue in force <HI>quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint;</HI> that their &s;alaries &s;hould be fixed, and none of them removeable but by an addre&s;s of both hou&s;es of parliament. It was then, without all doubt, the intention of the legi&s;lature, that every judge &s;hould enjoy his office during life, un|le&s;s convicted by legal trial of &s;ome mi&s;behaviour, or unle&s;s both hou&s;es of parliament &s;hould concur in de&s;iring his removal: but the doctrine now adopted imports, that no commi&s;&s;ion can continue in force longer than the life of the king by whom it was granted; that therefore the commi&s;&s;ions of the judges mu&s;t be renewed by a new king at his acce&s;&s;ion, who &s;hould have it in his power to em|ploy either tho&s;e whom he finds acting as judges at his acce&s;&s;ion, or confer their offices on others, with no other re&s;traint than that the condition of the new commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be <HI>quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;|&s;erint.</HI> Thus the office of a judge is rendered more precarious, and the influence of the crown receives a con&s;iderable reinforcement.</P>

A bill was accordingly brought in, couched in nearly the &s;ame terms which had been rejected in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; and it was &s;upported by a con&s;iderable number of members, animated with a true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m: but to the trading part of the nation it appeared one of tho&s;e plau&s;ible projects, which, though agreeable in &s;peculation, can never be reduced into

The motion for its being pa&s;&s;ed was violently op|po&s;ed; warm debates en&s;ued; they were adjourn|ed, and re&s;umed; and the arguments again&s;t the bill appeared at length in &s;uch a &s;triking light, that, when the que&s;tion was put, the majority de|clared for the negative.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the mercy of his creditor. By the original and common law of England, no man could be impri|&s;oned for debt. The plaintiff, in any civil action, could have no execution upon his judgment again&s;t either the body or the lands of the de|fendant: even with re&s;pect to his goods and chat|tels, which were &s;ubject to execution, he was obliged to leave him &s;uch articles as were nece&s;&s;ary for agriculture. But, in proce&s;s of time, this in|dulgence being found prejudicial to commerce, a law was enacted, in the reign of the fir&s;t Edward, allowing execution on the per&s;on of the debtor, provided his goods and chattels were not &s;ufficient to pay the debt which he had contracted. This law was &s;till attended with a very obvious inconve|nience. The debtor, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate in lands, was tempted to &s;ecrete his moveable ef|fects, and live in concealment on the produce of his lands, while the &s;heriff connived at his retire|ment.</P>
<P>To remove this evil, a &s;econd &s;tatute was enacted in the &s;ame reign, granting immediate execution again&s;t the body, lands, and goods of the debtor; yet his effects could not be &s;old for the benefit of his cre|ditor till the expiration of three months, during which he him&s;elf could di&s;po&s;e of them for ready money, in order to di&s;charge his incumbrances. If the creditor was not &s;atisfied in this manner, he continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the debtor's lands, and detained the debtor him&s;elf in pri&s;on, where he was obliged to &s;upply him with bread and water for his &s;upport, until the debt was di&s;charged. Other &s;e|vere regulations were made in the &s;equel, particu|larly in the reign of the third Edward, which gave
<PB N="57" REF="560">
ri&s;e to the writ of capias ad &s;atisfaciendum. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> indeed rendered the preceding laws, called &s;tatute-merchant, and &s;tatute-&s;taple, altogether unnece&s;&s;a|ry. Though the liberty of the &s;ubject, and the &s;e|curity of the landholder, were thus&punc; in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, &s;acrificed to the advantage of commerce, an impri&s;oned debtor was not left entirely at the mercy of an inexorable creditor. If he made all the &s;a|tisfaction in his power, and could &s;hew that his in&s;olvency was owing to real misfortunes, the court of chancery interpo&s;ed on his petition, and actually ordered him to be di&s;charged from pri&s;on, when no good rea&s;on for detaining him could be a&s;&s;igned. This interpo&s;ition, which &s;eems naturally to belong to a court of equity, con&s;tituted with a view to mitigate the rigour of the common law, cea&s;ed in all probability after the re&s;toration of the &s;econd Charles, and of con&s;equence the pri&s;ons were filled with debtors. Then the legi&s;lature charged them|&s;elves with the exten&s;ion of a power, which perhaps a chancellor no longer thought him&s;elf &s;afe in ex|erci&s;ing; and in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy, pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t act for the relief of in|&s;olvent debtors, granted a relea&s;e to all pri&s;oners for debt, without di&s;tinction or enquiry. By this general indulgence, which has even in a great mea|&s;ure continued in all &s;ub&s;equent acts of the &s;ame kind, the lenity of the parliament may be &s;ome|times mi&s;applied, in as much as in&s;olvency is often criminal, ari&s;ing from profligacy and extravagance, which de&s;erve to be &s;everely puni&s;hed. Yet, even for this &s;pecies of in&s;olvency, perpetual impri&s;on|ment, aggravated by the mi&s;eries of extreme indi|gence, and the danger of peri&s;hing through famine,
<PB N="58" REF="570">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> may be deemed a puni&s;hment too &s;evere. How cruel then mu&s;t it be to leave the mo&s;t innocent bankrupt expo&s;ed to this puni&s;hment, from the re|venge or &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign of a mercile&s;s creditor; a creditor, by who&s;e fraud perhaps the pri&s;oner be|came a bankrupt, and by who&s;e craft he is de|tained in gaol, le&s;t by his di&s;charge from pri&s;on, he &s;hould be enabled to &s;eek that redre&s;s in chancery, to which he is intitled on a fair account! The &s;e|verity of the law was certainly intended again&s;t fraudulent bankrupts only; and the &s;tatute of bankruptcy is, doubtle&s;s, favourable to in&s;olvents, as it di&s;charges from all former debts tho&s;e who ob|tain their certificates. As Briti&s;h &s;ubjects they are &s;urely intitled to the &s;ame indulgence which is granted to other in&s;olvents. They were always in|cluded in every act pa&s;&s;ed for the relief of in&s;olvent debtors, till the &s;ixth year of George I. when they were fir&s;t excepted from this benefit. By a law enacted in the reign of queen Anne, relating to bankruptcy, any creditor was at liberty to object to the confirmation of the bankrupt's certificate; but the chancellor had power to judge whether the objection was frivolous or well founded: yet, by a later act, the chancellor is obliged to confirm the certificate, if it is agreeable to four-fifths in number and value of the creditors; whereas he cannot con|firmit, &s;hould it be oppo&s;ed, even without any rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, by one creditor to whom the greate&s;t part of the debt is owing. It might therefore de&s;erve the con&s;ideration of parliament, whether, in ex|tending their clemency to the poor, it &s;hould not be equally diffu&s;ed to bankrupts and other in&s;ol|vents; whether proper di&s;tinction ought not to be

made between the innocent bankrupt, who fails<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> through misfortunes in trade, and him who be|comes in&s;olvent from fraud or profligacy; and finally, whether the enquiry and trial of all &s;uch ca&s;es would not properly fall within the pro|vince of chancery, a tribunal in&s;tituted for the mitigation of common law.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons &s;eems to have been deter|mined on another mea&s;ure, which, however, does not admit of explanation.

The bill was accordingly pre&s;ented, read, and printed, ordered to be committed to a commit|tee of the whole hou&s;e; but the order was delayed from time to time till the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

While the committee deliberated upon this affair, leave was given to prepare a bill for preventing tenants, un|der a certain yearly rent, from gaining &s;ettlements in any particular pari&s;h, by being there rated in any land-tax a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, and paying for the land|lord the money &s;o charged. This order was after|wards di&s;charged; and another bill brought in to prevent any per&s;on from gaining a &s;ettlement, by being rated by virtue of an act of parliament for granting any aid to his maje&s;ty, by a land-tax, and paying the &s;ame. The bill was accordingly pre|&s;ented, read, committed, and pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e; but among the lords it mi&s;carried. It can never be expected that the poor will be managed with oeconomy and integrity, while the execution of the laws relating to their maintenance is left in the hands of low trade&s;men, who derive private advantage from &s;upplying them with nece&s;&s;aries, and often favour the impo&s;ition of one another with the mo&s;t &s;candalous collu&s;ion. This is an evil which will never be remedied, until per&s;ons of in|dependent fortune, and unblemi&s;hed integrity, ac|tuated by a &s;pirit of true patrioti&s;m, &s;hall re&s;cue their fellow-citizens from the power of &s;uch inte|re&s;ted mi&s;creants, by taking the poor into their own management and protection. In&s;tead of multiply|ing laws with re&s;pect to the &s;ettlement and ma|nagement of the poor, which &s;erve only to puzzle and perplex the pari&s;h and peace officers, it would become the &s;agacity of the legi&s;lature to take &s;ome effectual precautions to prevent the increa&s;e of pau|pers and vagrants, which is become an intolerable nu&s;ance to the commonwealth. Towards this &s;a|lutary

The legi&s;lature, how|ever, would do well to con&s;ider this eternal maxim in computation, that when a greater quantity of bullion is exported, in wa&s;te, than can be replaced by commerce, the nation mu&s;t be ha&s;tening to a &s;tate of in&s;olvency. If four millions are &s;ent an|nually to the continent, from whence none returns, and the whole yearly profit ari&s;ing to Great Britain from the ballance of her trade does not exceed three millions, it is very plain, that the nation mu&s;$

The in&s;erence may perhaps appear more plain, from the compari&s;on of a ci&s;tern furni&s;hed with two pipes, one of which di&s;charges four gallons of the contents, while the other replaces no more than three: at this rate, the wa&s;te being greater than the &s;upply, in the proportion of four to three, the re&s;ervoir mu&s;t be &s;oon run to the bottom.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions for war.</NOTE> For the&s;e two purpo&s;es, every preparation was made that &s;agacity could &s;ugge&s;t, or vigour exe|cute.

In the beginning of the year, the court of London was overwhelmed with affliction at the death of the prince&s;s dowager of Orange and Na&s;|&s;au, gouvernante of the United Provinces in the minority of her &s;on the pre&s;ent &s;tadtholder. She was the elde&s;t daughter of his Britannic maje&s;ty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many per&s;onal accompli&s;hments and exemplary virtues, pious, moderate, &s;en&s;ible, and circum&s;pect. She had exerci&s;ed her authority with equal &s;agacity and re&s;olution, re&s;pected even by tho&s;e who were no friends to the hou&s;e of Orange&punc; and died with great fortitude and re&s;ignation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Feeling her end ap|proaching, &s;he delivered a key to one of her attendants, directing him to fetch two papers, which &s;he &s;igned with her own hand. One was a contract of marriage between her daughter and the prince of Na&s;&s;au Weilburg; the o|ther was a letter to the States General, be&s;eeching them to con&s;ent to this marriage, and pre&s;erve inviolate the regula|tions &s;he had made, touching the education and tutelage of the young &s;tadtholder. The&s;e two papers being &s;igned and &s;ealed, &s;he &s;ent for her chil|dren, exhorted them to make proper improvements on the education they had received&punc; and to live in harmony with each other. Then &s;he im|plored heaven to &s;hower its ble&s;&s;ings on them both, and embraced them with the mo&s;t affecting marks of maternal tenderne&s;s. She afterwards continued to conver&s;e calmly and deliberately with her friends, and in a few hours expired.</NOTE>. In

In the morning af|ter her decea&s;e, the States General and the &s;tates of Holland were extraordinarily a&s;&s;embled, and having received notice of this event, proceeded to confirm the regulations which had been made for the minority of the &s;tadtholder. Prince Louis of Brun&s;wic was invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly of Holland&punc; where he took the oaths as repre&s;enting the captain-general of the union. Then he com|municated to the a&s;&s;embly, the act by which the prince&s;s had appointed him guardian of her chil|dren. He was afterwards invited to the a&s;&s;embly of the States General, who agreed to the re&s;olu|tion of Holland with re&s;pect to his guardian&s;hip; and in the evening, the different colleges of the go|vernment &s;ent formal deputations to the young &s;tadtholder, and the prince&s;s Caroline his &s;i&s;ter, in who&s;e names and pre&s;ence they were received, and an&s;wered by their guardian and repre&s;entative. A formal intimation of the death of the prince&s;s was communicated to the king her father, in a pathetic letter, by the States General, who condoled with him on the irreparable lo&s;s, which he as well as they had &s;u&s;tained by this melancholy event; and a&s;&s;ured him they would employ all their care and attention in &s;ecuring and defending the rights and intere&s;ts of the young &s;tadtholder, and the prince&s;s his &s;i&s;ter, whom they con&s;idered as the children of the republic.

While the&s;e &s;teps were taken to re&s;cue the nation from the reproach of violence and rapacity, which her neighbours had urged with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, equal &s;pirit was ex|erted in convincing neutral powers that they &s;hould not, with impunity, contravene the law of nations, in favouring the enemies of Great Britain. A great number of cau&s;es was tried, relating to di&s;|puted captures, and many Dutch ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes, were condemned after a fair hearing, not|with&s;tanding the loud clamours of that people, and the repeated remon&s;trances of the States General.</P>

His inhuman tyrant envying him that death&punc; which would have re&s;cued a mi|&s;erable object from his brutality, plunged into the &s;ea after him, and brought him on board, declaring he &s;hould not &s;o e&s;cape while there were any tor|ments left to inflict. Accordingly he exerci&s;ed his tyranny upon him with redoubled rigour, until the poor creature expired, in con&s;equence of the inhu|man treatment he had &s;u&s;tained. This &s;avage ruf|fian was likewi&s;e indicted for the murder of an|other mariner, but being convicted on the fir&s;t trial, the &s;econd was found unnece&s;&s;ary, and the criminal &s;uffered death according to the law, which is per|haps too mild to malefactors convicted of &s;uch ag|gravated cruelty. Another barbarous murder was perpetrated in the country near Birmingham, upon a &s;heriff's officer, by the &s;ons of one Darby, who&s;e effects the bailiff had &s;eized on a di&s;tre&s;s for rent. The two young a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, encouraged by the father, attacked the unhappy wretch with clubs, and mangled him in a terrible manner, &s;o that he hardly retained any &s;igns of life. Not contented with this cruel execution, they &s;tripped him naked, and dragging him out of the hou&s;e, &s;courged him with a waggoner's whip, until the fle&s;h was cut from his bones. In this mi&s;erable condition he was found weltring in his blood, and conveyed to a neighbouring hou&s;e, where he immediately ex|pired. The three barbarians were apprehended, after having made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance.

By dint of &s;truggling the poor wretch di&s;|engaged him&s;elf from the cord with which he had been tied: then they fini&s;hed the tragedy, by leap|ing and &s;tamping on his brea&s;t, till the che&s;t was broke, and he expired.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> then they &s;uddenly attacked the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, and cleft his head with an hatchet, which they likewi&s;e u&s;ed in murdering the man that &s;tood at the helm; a third was likewi&s;e di&s;patched, and no Engli&s;hman remained alive but the ma&s;ter's &s;on, a boy&punc; who lamented his father's death with ince&s;|&s;ant tears and cries for three days, at the expiration of which he was likewi&s;e &s;acrificed, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were di&s;turbed by his clamour. This bar|barous &s;cene was acted within &s;ixty leagues of the rock of Li&s;bon; but the ve&s;&s;el was taken between the capes Ortugal and Fini&s;terre, by the captain of a French privateer called La Favourite, who &s;ee|ing the deck &s;tained with blood, and finding all the papers of the &s;hip de&s;troyed, began to &s;u&s;pect that the ma&s;ter and crew had been murdered. He ac|cordingly taxed them with the murder, and they confe&s;&s;ed the particulars. The privateer touched at Vigo, where the captain imparted this detail to the Engli&s;h con&s;ul; but the prize, with the two villains on board, was &s;ent to Bayonne in France, where it is to be hoped, for the honour of huma|nity, they were brought to condign puni&s;hment, notwith&s;tanding the war that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the two nations; for there are certain e&s;tabli&s;hed rights of general ju&s;tice and humanity, which no parti|cular war can de&s;troy. We &s;hall clo&s;e this regi&s;ter of blood with the account of a murder, remarkable in all its circum&s;tances, for which a per&s;on called Eugene Aram, &s;uffered at York in the cour&s;e of this year. This man, who exerci&s;ed the profe&s;|&s;ion of a &s;choolma&s;ter at Knare&s;borough, had, a$ far back as the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty five, been concerned with one Hou&s;e

man, in robbing and murdering Daniel Clarke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> whom they had previou&s;ly per&s;uaded to borrow a con&s;iderable quantity of valuable effects from dif|ferent per&s;ons in the neighbourhood, on fal&s;e pre|tences, that he might retire with the booty. He had accordingly filled a &s;ack with the&s;e particulars, and begun his retreat with his two perfidious a&s;&s;o|ciates, who &s;uddenly fell upon him, deprived him of life, and, having buried the body in a cave, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plunder. Though Clarke di&s;appeared at once in &s;uch a my&s;terious manner, no &s;u&s;picion fell upon the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; and Aram, who was the chief contriver and agent in the murder, moved his habitation to another part of the coun|try. In the &s;ummer of the pre&s;ent year, Hou&s;e|man being employed, among other labourers, in repairing the public highway, they, in digging for gravel by the road &s;ide, di&s;covered the &s;keleton of a human creature, which the majority &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bones of Daniel Clarke. This opinion was no &s;ooner broached than Hou&s;eman, as it were by &s;ome &s;upernatural impul&s;e which he could not re&s;i&s;t, declared that it was not the &s;keleton of Clarke, in|a&s;much as his body had been interred in a place called St. Robert's Cave, where they would find it with the head turned to a certain corner. He was immediately apprehended, examined, admitted as evidence for the crown, and di&s;covered the par|ticulars of the murder. The &s;keleton of Clarke being found exactly in the place and manner he had de&s;cribed, Eugene Aram, who now acted as u&s;her to a grammar-&s;chool in the county of Nor|folk, was &s;ecured, and brought to trial at the York a&s;&s;izes. There, his own wife corroborating the te&s;|timony

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of Hou&s;eman, he was found guilty, and received &s;entence of death, notwith&s;tanding a very artful and learned defence, in which he proved, from argument and example, the danger of con|victing a man upon circum&s;tantial evidence. Find|ing all his remon&s;trances ineffectual, he recom|mended him&s;elf in pathetic terms to the king's mercy; and if ever murder was intitled to indul|gence, perhaps it might have been extended, not improperly, to this man, who&s;e genius, in it&s;elf prodigious, might have exerted it&s;elf in works of general utility. He had, in &s;pite of all the di&s;ad|vantages attending low birth, and &s;traitened cir|cum&s;tances, by the dint of his own capacity and inclination, made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in mathe|matics and philo&s;ophy, acquired all the languages ancient and modern, and executed part of a Celtic dictionary, which, had he lived to fini&s;h it, might have thrown &s;ome e&s;&s;ential light upon the ori|gin and ob&s;curities of the European Hi&s;tory. Convinced, at la&s;t, that he had nothing to hope from the clemency of the government, he wrote a &s;hort poem in defence of &s;uicide; and, on the day fixed for his execution, opened the veins of his left arm with a razor, which he had concealed for that purpo&s;e. Though he was much weakened by the effu&s;ion of blood, before this attempt was di&s;co|vered; yet, as the in&s;trument had mi&s;&s;ed the artery, he did not expire until he was carried to the gibbet, and underwent the &s;entence of the law. His body was conveyed to Knare&s;borough-fore&s;t, and hung in chains, near the place where the murder was perpetrated. The&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t remark|able that appeared among many other in&s;tances of

<P>I being perfectly well, both in body and mind, now that I am writing this my la&s;t will, by which I do hereby give, order, and di&s;po&s;e of what is mi$e, both real and per&s;onal, that there may be no di&s;putes after I am gone&mdash;Therefore, as I began the world with no|thing, and as all I have is of my own acquiring, I di&s;po&s;e of it as I plea&s;e. But, fir&s;t, I direct and order, that as there is now a peace, and I may die the common way, my carca&s;e may be put any where; it is equal to me: but I will have no more expence, or ridicu|lous &s;how, than if a poor &s;ol|dier (who is as good a man) was to be buried from the ho&s;|pital. The prie&s;t, I conclude, will have his fee; let the puppy have it; pay the carpenter for the carca&s;e box. Debts I have none at this time: &s;ome very &s;mall trifles of cour&s;e there may be; let them be paid; there is wherewith to do it. Fir&s;t, then, to my only &s;i&s;ter Anne Hawley, if &s;he &s;urvives me, I give and bequeath five thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling out of the &s;even thou&s;and five hun|dred which I have at this time in bank-annuities of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-eight. Be that al|tered or not, I &s;till give her five thou&s;and pounds out of what I die worth, to di&s;|po&s;e of as &s;he plea&s;es, and this to be made over to her, or paid, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after I am dead; a month at mo&s;t. As to any other rela|tions, I have none who want; and I as was never married, I have no heirs; I therefore have long &s;ince taken it in my head to adopt one heir and &s;on, after the manner of the Romans, who I hereafter name. But fir&s;t, there is one Mrs. Elizabeth Toovey, widow, mother of this afore|&s;aid adopted &s;on, who has been for many years my friend and companion, and often my careful nur&s;e, and in my ab&s;ence a faithful &s;teward: &s;he is the per&s;on I think my|&s;elf bound in honour and gra|titude to provide for as well as I can, during her life. I do therefore give and be|queath unto the &s;aid Eliza|beth Toovey, widow, all that my freehold e&s;tate, hou&s;es, outhou&s;es, &amp;c. and all the land thereto belonging, &s;itu|ated at the upper end of We&s;t-Green, in the pari&s;h of Hartley-Wintney, and county of Southampton, which I bought of William Shipway: I likewi&s;e give the &s;aid Eliza|beth Toovey the lands or farm, commonly called Ex|all's farm, which join to the afore&s;aid lands bought of William Shipway, and which I bought of lord Ca&s;tlemain. I al&s;o give her the field adjoining thereto, which I bought of farmer Hellhou&s;e, called the paddock. I like|wi&s;e give to the &s;aid Elizabeth Toovey my farm-hou&s;e, other hou&s;e, and all outhou&s;es, &amp;c. and all the lands thereto be|longing, &s;ituate at the bot|tom of We&s;t-Green pari&s;h, and county afore&s;aid, which farm, lands, &amp;c. I bought of farmer Hellhou&s;e. I likewi&s;e give and bequeath unto the &s;aid Elizabeth Toovey, the great meadow which I bought of Thomas Ellis, carpenter, or wright, which is commonly called Tilligany; and I give al&s;o the little meadow over-again&s;t the great one, part of the purcha&s;e made of far|mer Hellhou&s;e, to her. And I al&s;o give to the &s;aid Eliza|beth Toovey a little barn and farm I lately purcha&s;ed, called Birchen Reeds, upon Hazely Heath, in the pari&s;h of Mat|tingly, or Heezfield. I like|wi&s;e give and bequeath to the &s;aid Elizabeth Toovey my hou&s;e, &s;tables, outhou&s;es, and all the ground thereto be|longing, which I purcha&s;ed lately of the widow Rooke, &s;ituate in the pari&s;h of St. George, near Hyde-park gate, in the county of Middle&s;ex, &s;he to hold and po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e &s;everal hou&s;es and e&s;tates during her natural life; and then, after her di&s;ea&s;e, I give and bequeath them unto her &s;econd &s;on, Captain William Toovey, my adopted &s;on and heir, at pre&s;ent a captain in the regiment of royal dra|goons under my command; then when his mother dies, and not before, the whole which I have and do give her, to come to him, and be his and his heirs for ever. And do direct and require the &s;aid captain William Too|vey, that as &s;oon as I am dead he &s;hall forthwith take upon him both my names, and &s;ign them, either by act of parliament, or otherwi&s;e, as &s;hall be needful.

I do appoint captain William Toovey my &s;ole executor and tru&s;tee, to &s;ee this my will executed punctually, and to act in behalf of my &s;i&s;ter, his
mother, brother, and him|&s;elf, and to &s;tate my accounts with my agent for the time being, and all others con|cerned. As to his brother lieutenant-colonel John Too|vey, I give and bequeath unto him one thou&s;and pounds out of the money the govern|ment owes me, when paid. I al&s;o give him all my hor&s;es and arms. I al&s;o give him up the writings and money which his brother captain William Toovey owes me, lent him for the &s;everal pre|ferments in the regiment. I give and bequeath to Eliza|beth Burkitt, &s;pin&s;ter, one hundred pounds as a legacy, &s;he having been an u&s;eful a|greeable handmaid to me; but upon this condition that &s;he never marries lieutenant-colonel J. T. if &s;he does, I give her nothing. Likewi&s;e, if lieutenant-colonel J. T. &s;hould be fool enough ever to marry her Elizabeth Burkitt, I di&s;annul whatever relates to her and him; and I give no|thing either to lieutenant-co|lonel T. or to her. And if after all this, they &s;hould be both fools, and marry, I do hereby give, what I had given to them, I &s;ay, I give it to my &s;i&s;ter Anne Hawley, and her heirs, and order her or them to &s;ue for the &s;ame. I once more appoint captain William Toovey, my execu|tor and tru&s;tee, and I order him to admini&s;ter: there is no debts will trouble him or his mother: what there is &s;he &s;hall pay; and that he im|mediately wait on my &s;i&s;ter with a copy of this will&punc; if &s;he &s;urvives me; if not, what I give her is his.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A deplo|rable in|cident at &s;ea.</NOTE> We &s;hall conclude the remarkable incidents of this year, that are detached from the pro&s;ecution of the war, with the detail of an event equally &s;ur|pri&s;ing and deplorable. A &s;loop called the Dol|phin, bound from the Canaries to New-York, met with &s;uch unfavourable weather, that &s;he was de|tained one hundred and &s;ixty-five days in the pa&s;|&s;age, and the provi&s;ion of the &s;hip was altogether expended before the fir&s;t fifty days were elap&s;ed. The wretched crew had devoured their dog, cat, and all the &s;hoes on board: at length being redu|ced to the utmo&s;t extremity, they agreed to ca&s;t lots for their lives, that the body of him upon whom the lot &s;hould fall, might &s;erve for &s;ome time to &s;upport the &s;urvivors. The wretched victim was one Antonio Galatia, a Spani&s;h gentleman and
<PB N="97" REF="960">
pa&s;&s;enger. Him they &s;hot with a mu&s;quet; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> having cut off his head, threw it overboard; but the intrails, and the re&s;t of the carca&s;e, they gree|dily devoured. This horrid banquet having, as it were, fle&s;hed the fami&s;hed crew, they began to talk of another &s;acrifice, from which, however, they were diverted by the influence and remon|&s;trances of their captain, who prevailed upon them to be &s;atisfied with a mi&s;erable allowance to each per diem, cut from a pair of leathern breeches found in the cabbin. Upon this calamitous pit|tance, reinforced with the gra&s;s which grew plen|tifully upon the deck, the&s;e poor objects made &s;hift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for twenty days, at the expiration of which they were relieved, and taken on board one captain Brad&s;haw, who chanced to fall in with them at &s;ea. By this time the whole crew, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;even men, were &s;o &s;qualid and ema|ciated, as to exhibit an appearance at once piteous and terrible; and &s;o reduced in point of &s;trength, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e ropes and tackle for hoi&s;ting them from one &s;hip to the other. The circum&s;tance of the lot falling upon the Spaniard, who was the only foreigner on board, encourages a &s;u&s;picion that foul play was offered to this unfortu|nate &s;tranger; but the mo&s;t remarkable part of this whole incident is, that the ma&s;ter and crew could not contrive &s;ome &s;ort of tackle to catch fi&s;h, with which the &s;ea every where abounds, and which, no doubt, might be caught with the help of a little ingenuity. If implements of this kind were provided in every &s;hip, they would probably prevent all tho&s;e tragical events at &s;ea that are oc|ca&s;ioned by famine.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Previous to the more capital operations in war, we &s;hall particularize the mo&s;t remarkable captures<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captures made by &s;eparate cruizers.</NOTE> that were made upon the enemy by &s;ingle &s;hips of war, during the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer and autumn. In the month of February a French privateer, be|longing to Granville, called the Marquis de Ma|rigny, having on board near two hundred men, and mounted with twenty cannon, was taken by captain Parker, commander of his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Montague; who likewi&s;e made prize of a &s;maller armed ve&s;&s;el, from Dunkirk, of eight can|non and &s;ixty men.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain Hood takes the Bellona.</NOTE> In the month of February, captain Hood, of his maje&s;ty's frigate the Ve&s;tal, belonging to a &s;mall &s;quadron commanded by admiral Holmes, who had &s;ailed for the We&s;t Indies in January, being advanced a con&s;iderable way a-head of the fleet de&s;cried and gave chace to a &s;ail, which proved t$ be a French frigate called the Bellona, of two hun+dred

Captain Hood, having made a &s;ignal to the ad|miral, continued the chace until he advanced with|in half mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the enemy, and then poured in a broad&s;ide, which was immediately retorted. The engagement, thus begun, was maintained with great vigour on both &s;ides for the &s;pace of four hours; at the expiration of which the Bel|lona &s;truck, after having lo&s;t all her ma&s;ts and rigging, together with about forty men killed in the action: nor was the victor in a much better condition. Thirty men were killed and wounded on board of the Ve&s;tal. Immediately after the enemy &s;ubmitted, all her rigging being de&s;troyed by the &s;hot, the topma&s;t fell overboard; and &s;he was otherwi&s;e &s;o damaged, that &s;he could not pro|ceed on her voyage. Captain Hood, therefore, re|turned with his prize to Spithead; and afterwards met with a gracious reception from his maje&s;ty, on account of the valour and conduct he had di&s;played on this occa&s;ion. The Bellona had &s;ailed in Janua|ry from the i&s;land of Martinique, along with the Flori&s;&s;ant, and another French frigate, from which &s;he had been &s;eparated in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Immediately after this exploit, captain Elliot, of the Aeolus frigate, accompanied by the I&s;is, made prize of a French &s;hip, the Mignonne, of twenty guns, and one hundred and forty men, one of four frigates employed as convoy to a large fleet of merchant-&s;hips, near the i&s;land of Rh&eacute;e.</P>

As they fought in the dark, captain Gilchri&s;t was obliged to lie by for &s;ome time, be|cau&s;e he could not di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other; but no &s;ooner did the day appear than he bore down upon the Danae with his u&s;ual impe|tuo&s;ity, and &s;oon compelled her to &s;urrender: &s;he did not &s;trike, however, until thirty or forty of her men were &s;lain; and the gallant captain Gilchri&s;t had received a grape-&s;hot in his &s;houlder, which though it did not deprive him of life, yet rendered him incapable of future &s;ervice: a misfortune the more to be lamented, as it happened to a brave of|ficer in the vigour of his age, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;anguinary war, which might have afforded him many other opportunities of &s;ignalizing his cou|rage, for the honour and advantage of his country.</P>

Intelligence having been received that the enemy meditated an inva&s;ion upon &s;ome of the Briti&s;h territories, and that a number of flat|bottomed boats were prepared at Havre de Grace, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;embarking troops, rear ad|miral Rodney was, in the beginning of July, de|tached with a &s;mall &s;quadron of &s;hips and bombs to annoy and overawe that part of the coa&s;t of France. He accordingly anchored in the road of Havre, and made a di&s;po&s;ition to execute the in|&s;tructions he had received. The bomb ve&s;&s;els be|ing placed in the narrow channel of the river lead|ing to Honfleur, began to throw their &s;hells, and continued the bombardment for two and fifty hours, without intermi&s;&s;ion, during which a numerous body of French troops was employed in throwing up entrenchments, erecting new batteries, and firing both with &s;hot and &s;hells upon the a&s;&s;ailants. The town was &s;et on fire in &s;everal places, and burned with great fury; &s;ome of the boats were overturned, and a few of them reduced to a&s;hes, while the inhabitants for&s;ook the place in the ut|mo&s;t con&s;ternation: neverthele&s;s, the damage done to the enemy was too incon&s;iderable to make amends for the expence of the armament, and the

It mu&s;t be owned, however, that his fir&s;t attempt favoured of temerity. Having in vain di&s;|played the Briti&s;h flag in &s;ight of Toulon, by way of defiance to the French fleet that there lay at an|chor, he ordered three &s;hips of the line, commanded by the captains Smith, Harland, and Barker, to advance and burn two &s;hips that lay clo&s;e to the mouth of the harbour.

Admiral Bo&s;cawen, who commanded fourteen &s;ail of the line, with two frigates, and as many fire|&s;hips, having refitted his &s;quadron, detached one frigate to crui&s;e off Malaga, and another to hover between E&s;tepona and Ceuta-point; with a view to keep a good look out, and give timely no|tice in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould approach. On the &s;eventeeth day of Augu&s;t, at eight in the even|ing, the Gibraltar frigate made a &s;ignal that four|teen &s;ail appeared on the Barbary &s;nore to the ea&s;t|ward of Ceuta; upon which the Engli&s;h admiral immediately heaved up his anchors and went to &s;ea: at day light he de&s;cried &s;even large &s;hips lying to; but when the Engli&s;h &s;quadron forbore to an&s;wer their &s;ignal, they di&s;covered their mi&s;take, &s;et all their &s;ails, and made the be&s;t of their way.

Even now perhaps he might have e&s;caped, had he not been obliged to wait for the Souveraine, which was a heavy &s;ailer. At noon the wind, which had blown a fre&s;h gale, died away; and although admiral Bo&s;cawen had made &s;ignal to chace and en|gage in a line of battle a-head, it was not till half an hour after two that &s;ome of his headmo&s;t &s;hips could clo&s;e with the rear of the enemy; which, though greatly outnumbered, fought with uncom|mon bravery.

to return the fire of the &s;ternmo&s;t, which he re|ceived<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> as he pa&s;&s;ed, u&s;ed all his endeavours to come up with the Ocean, which Mr. de la Clue com|manded in per&s;on; and about four o'clock in the afternoon running athwart her haw&s;e, poured into her a furious broad&s;ide: thus the engagement began with equal vigour on both &s;ides. This di&s;pute how|ever was of &s;hort duration; in about half an hour admiral Bo&s;cawen's mizen-ma&s;t and top&s;ail-yards were &s;hot away; and the enemy hoi&s;ted all the &s;ail they could carry. Mr. Bo&s;cawen having &s;hifted his flag from the Namur to the Newark, joined &s;ome other &s;hips in attacking the Centaur of &s;eventy-four cannon, which, being thus overpowered, was ob|liged to &s;urrender. The Briti&s;h admiral pur&s;ued them all night, during which the Souveraine and the Guerrier altered their cour&s;e, and de&s;erted their commander. At day-break, Mr. de la Clue, who&s;e left leg had been broke in the engagement, perceiv|ing the Engli&s;h &s;quadron crowding all their &s;ails to come up with him, and finding him&s;elf on the coa&s;t of Portugal, determined to burn his &s;hips rather than they &s;hould fall into the hands of the victors. The Ocean was run a&s;hore two leagues from Lagos, near the fort of Almadana, the com|mander of which fired three &s;hots at the Engli&s;h: another captain of the French &s;quadron followed the example of his commander; and both endea|voured to di&s;embark their men: but the &s;ea being rough, this proved a very tedious and difficult at|tempt. The captains of the Temeraire and Mo|de&s;te, in&s;tead of de&s;troying their &s;hips, anchored as near as they could to the forts Exavier and Lagres,
<PB N="108" REF="1080">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> in hope of enjoying their protection; but in this hope they were di&s;appointed. Mr. de la Clue had been landed, and the command of the Ocean was left to the Count de Carne, who having received one broad&s;ide from the America, &s;truck his colours, and the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this noble prize, the be&s;t &s;hip in the French navy, mounted with eighty cannon. Captain Bentley of the War&s;pight, who had remarkably &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his cou|rage during the action of the preceding day, at|tacked the Temeraire of &s;eventy four guns, and brought her off with little damage. Vice-admiral Broderick, the &s;econd in command, advancing with his divi&s;ion, burned the Redoubtable of &s;eventy|four guns, which was bulged, and abandoned by her men and officers; but they made prize of the Mode&s;te, carrying &s;ixty-four guns, which had not been much injured in the engagement. This vic|tory was obtained by the Engli&s;h admiral at a very &s;mall expence of men; the whole number of the killed and wounded not exceeding two hundred and fifty on board of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron; though the carnage among the enemy mu&s;t have been much more con&s;iderable, as Mr. de la Clue, in his letter to the French amba&s;&s;ador at Li&s;bon, owns, that on board of his own &s;hip the Ocean, one hundred men were killed on the &s;pot, and &s;eventy dangerou&s;ly wounded: but the mo&s;t &s;evere circum&s;tance of this di&s;a&s;ter was the lo&s;s of four capital &s;hips, two of which were de&s;troyed, and the other two brought in triumph to England, to be numbered among the be&s;t bottoms of the Briti&s;h navy.

In the latter end of Oc|tober the two hou&s;es of parliament, a&s;&s;embled at Dublin, received a formal me&s;&s;age from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of that kingdom, to the following effect: That, by a letter from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, written by his maje&s;ty's expre&s;s command, it appeared that France, far from re|&s;igning her plan of inva&s;ion, on account of the di&s;a&s;ter that befel her Toulon &s;quadron, was more and more confirmed in her purpo&s;e, and even in&s;ti|gated by de&s;pair it&s;elf, to attempt, at all hazards, the only re&s;ource &s;he &s;eemed to have left, for thwart|ing, by a diver&s;ion at home, the mea&s;ures of Eng|land abroad, in pro&s;ecuting a war which hitherto opened, in all parts of the world, &s;o unfavourable a pro&s;pect to the views of French ambition: that in ca&s;e the body of French troops, amounting to eighteen thou&s;and men, under the command of the duc d'Aiguillon, a&s;&s;embled at Vannes, where al&s;o a &s;ufficient number of tran&s;ports was prepared, &s;hould be able to elude the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, Ire|land would, in all probability, be one of their chief objects; his grace thought it therefore incumbent upon him, in a matter of &s;uch high importance to the welfare of that kingdom, to communicate this intelligence to the Iri&s;h parliament.

broke out with extraordinary violence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> among the populace of Dublin. The pre&s;ent lord l&mdash;t was not remarkably popular in his admini&s;tration. He had be&s;towed one place of con|&s;iderable importance upon a gentleman who&s;e per|&s;on was obnoxious to many people in that king|dom, and perhaps failed in that affability and con|de&s;cen&s;ion which a free and ferocious nation ex|pects to find in the character of him to who&s;e rule they are &s;ubjected. Whether the offence taken at his deportment had created enemies to his per&s;on, or the nation in general began to entertain doubts and jealou&s;ies of the government's de&s;igns; certain it is, great pains were taken to propagate a belief among the lower &s;ort of people, that an union would &s;oon be effected between Great Britain and Ireland; in which ca&s;e this la&s;t kingdom would be deprived of its parliament and independency, and be &s;ub|jected to the &s;ame taxes that are levied upon the people of England. This notion inflamed the po|pulace to &s;uch a degree, that they a&s;&s;embled in a prodigious multitude, broke into the hou&s;e of lords, in&s;ulted the peers, &s;eated an old woman on the throne, and &s;earched for the journals, which, had they been found, they would have committed to the flames. Not content with this outrage, they compelled the members of both hou&s;es whom they met in the &s;treets to take an oath that they would never con&s;ent to &s;uch an union, or give any vote contrary to the true intere&s;t of Ireland. Divers coaches belonging to obnoxious per&s;ons were de|&s;troyed, and their hor&s;es killed; and a gibbet was erected for one gentleman in particular, who nar|rowly e&s;caped the ungovernable rage of tho&s;e ri|otous

Next day addre&s;&s;es to the lord&punc;lieutenant were agreed to by both hou&s;es of parliament, and a committee of inquiry appointed, that the ring&punc;leaders of the tumult might be di&s;covered and brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>

A plan had been formed for improving the &s;ucce&s;s of the preceding year in North America, by carrying the Briti&s;h arms up the river St. Laurence, and be&s;ieging Que|bec, the capital of Canada. The armament em|ployed again&s;t the French i&s;lands of Martinique and Guadalupe, con&s;tituted part of this de&s;ign; ina&s;|much as the troops embarked on that expedition were, in ca&s;e of a mi&s;carriage at Martinique, in|tended to reinforce the Briti&s;h army in North Ame|rica, which was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the chief &s;eat of the war. What hope of &s;ucce&s;s the admini&s;tration conceived from an attempt upon Martinique, may be gue&s;&s;ed from the &s;tate of that i&s;land, as it ap|peared in a memorial pre&s;ented by the French king's lieutenants of its &s;everal di&s;tricts, to the general of the French i&s;lands, in con&s;equence of an order i&s;&s;ued in November, for holding them in readine&s;s to march and defend the i&s;land from the Engli&s;h, of who&s;e de&s;ign they were appri&s;ed. They repre&s;ented, that the trade with the Dutch was become their &s;ole dependence; that they could expect no &s;uccour from Europe, by which they had been abandoned

As to &s;laves half&punc;&s;tarved, all kinds of bondage were equal; and people reduced to &s;uch a &s;ituation were often driven to de&s;pair, &s;eeking in anarchy and confu&s;ion a remedy from the evils by which they were oppre&s;&s;ed: that the be&s;t pro|vided of the inhabitants laboured under the want of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life; and others had not &s;o much as a grain of &s;alt in their hou&s;es: that there was an irreparable &s;carcity of &s;laves to culti|vate their lands; and the planters were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of killing their cattle to &s;upport the lives of tho&s;e who remained alive; &s;o that the mills were no longer worked, and the inhabitants con|&s;umed beforehand what ought to be re&s;erved for their &s;u&s;tenance, in ca&s;e of being blocked up by the enemy. They de&s;ired therefore, that the general would &s;uppre&s;s the permi&s;&s;ions granted to particular merchants, and admit neutral ve&s;&s;els freely into their ports, that they might trade with the coloni&s;ts un|mole&s;ted

<P>This remon&s;trance plainly proves that the i&s;land was wholly unprepared to repel the meditated inva|&s;ion, and ju&s;tifies the plan adopted by the mini&s;|try of Great Britain. The regular troops of Marti|nique con&s;i&s;ted of about twenty independent com|panies, greatly defective in point of number.

The chief fortification of Martinique was the citadel of Port Royal, a regular fort, garri&s;oned by four compa|nies that did not exceed the number of one hun|dred and fifty men, thirty-&s;ix bombardiers, eighty Swi&s;s, and fourteen officers. One hundred barrels of beef con&s;tituted their whole &s;tore of provi&s;ion; but they were de&s;titute of all other nece&s;&s;aries. They were almo&s;t wholly unprovided with water in the ci&s;terns, with &s;pare carriages for their cannon, match, wadding, and langrage: they had but a &s;mall &s;tock of other ammunition, and the walls were in many parts decayed. The only prepara|tions they had made for receiving the Engli&s;h, were &s;ome paultry intrenchments thrown up at St. Pierre, and a place called Ca&s;enavire, where they imagined the de&s;cent would probably be attempt|ed.

This eminence, called the Morne Tortue|&s;on, though the mo&s;t important po&s;t of the whole i&s;land, was neglected by the general of Martinique, who had al&s;o re&s;olved to blow up the fortifications of the Citadel: but, luckily for the i&s;landers, he had not prepared the materials for this operation, which mu&s;t have been attended with the imme|diate reduction of the capital, and indeed of the whole country. Some of the inferior officers, knowing the importance of the Morne Tortue&s;$n, re&s;olved to defend that po&s;t with a body of the mi|litia, which was reinforced by the garri&s;ons of Fort Negro and Ca&s;enavire, as well as by &s;ome &s;oldiers

Before the re&s;olution of pro|ceeding to Guadalupe was taken, the commodore had ordered the bay to be &s;ounded, and directed the Rippon to advance, and &s;ilence a battery &s;itu|ated a mile and a half to the northward of St. Pierre. Accordingly captain Harman, who commanded that &s;hip, &s;tood in, and anchoring clo&s;e to the &s;hore, attacked it with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that in a few minutes it was abandoned. At the &s;ame time the Rippon was expo&s;ed to the fire of three other batteries, from which &s;he received con&s;iderable da|mage both in her hull and rigging; and was in great danger of running aground, when orders were given to tow her out of danger.</P>

A di&s;po&s;ition being made for this purpo&s;e, the large &s;hips took their re&s;pective &s;tations next morning, which was the twenty-third day of January. At nine, the Lyon, commanded by captain Trelaw|ney, began the engagement again&s;t a battery of ninety guns; and the re&s;t of the fleet continued to place them&s;elves a-brea&s;t of the other batteries and the citadel, which mounted forty-&s;ix cannon, be&s;ides two mortars.

<P>This expedient of an admiral's removing his flag, and retiring from the action while his own &s;hip is engaged, how&s;oever con&s;onant to rea&s;on, we do not remember to have &s;een practi&s;ed upon any other occa&s;ion, except in one in&s;tance at Car|thagena, where Sir Chaloner Ogle quitted his own &s;hip, when &s;he was ordered to &s;tand in and can|nonade the fort of Bocca Chica.</P>
<P>In this pre&s;ent attack, all the &s;ea commanders behaved with extraordinary &s;pirit and re&s;olution, particularly the captains Le&s;lie, Burnet, Gayton, Jekyl, Trelawney, and Shuldam; who, in the hot|te&s;t tumult of the action, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves equally by their courage, impetuo&s;ity, and delibe|ration. About five in the afternoon, the fire of the citadel was exhau&s;ted. The Burford and Ber|wick were driven out to &s;ea; &s;o that captain Shul|dam in the Panther was un&s;u&s;tained; and two batteries played upon the Rippon, captain Jekyl, who, by two in the afternoon, &s;ilenced the guns of one called the Morne-rouge; but at the &s;ame time could not prevent his &s;hip from running a ground. The enemy perceiving her di&s;a&s;ter, a&s;&s;embled in great numbers on the hill, and lined the trenches, from whence they poured in a &s;evere fire of mu&s;|quetry. The militia afterwards brought up a can|non of eighteen pound ball; and for two hours raked her fore and aft with con&s;iderable effect: neverthele&s;s, captain Jekyl returned the fire with

In the mean time, the cap|tain threw out a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s; to which no regard was payed, till captain Le&s;lie of the Bri|&s;tol coming from &s;ea, and ob&s;erving his &s;ituation, ran in between the Rippon and the battery; and engaged with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as made an im|mediate diver&s;ion in favour of captain Jekyl, who&s;e &s;hip remained a-ground&punc; notwith&s;tanding all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance that could be given, till mid-night, when &s;he floa$ed, and e&s;caped from the very jaws of de|&s;truction. At &s;even in the evening, all the other large &s;hips having &s;ilenced the guns to which they had been re&s;pectively oppo&s;ed, he joined the re&s;t of the fleet. The four bombs being anchored near the &s;hore, began to ply the town with &s;hells and carca&s;&s;es; &s;o that in a little time the hou&s;es were in flames, the magazines of gun-powder blew up with the mo&s;t terrible explo&s;ion; and about ten o'clock the whole place blazed out one general conflagration.</P>

The train was immediately cut off, and the magazine &s;ecured. The nails with which they had &s;piked up their can|non, were drilled out by the matro&s;&s;es; and in the mean time&punc; the Briti&s;h colours were hoi&s;ted on the parapet.

Indeed from the beginning his deportment had been &s;uch as gave a very unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of his cha|racter.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Skir|mi&s;hes with the i&s;landers.</NOTE> But how&s;oever deficient the governor might have been in the article of courage, certain it is the inhabitants behaved with great &s;pirit and activity in defence of their country. They continually har|ra&s;&s;ed the &s;couring detachments, by firing upon them from woods and &s;ugar plantations, which la&s;t the Engli&s;h burned about their ears in re&s;entment. Their armed negroes were very expert in this kind of bu&s;h-fighting. The natives or militia appeared in con&s;iderable parties, and even encountered de|tached bodies of the Briti&s;h army. A lady of ma&s;|culine courage, who&s;e name was Ducharmey, hav|ing armed her &s;laves, headed them in per&s;on, made &s;everal bold attempts upon an advanced po&s;t, oc|cupied by major Melville, and threw up entrench|ments upon a hill oppo&s;ite to the &s;tation of this of|ficer, who had all along &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his uncommon intrepidity, vigilance, and conduct. At length the works of this virago were &s;tormed by a regular detachment, which, after an ob&s;ti|nate and dangerous conflict, entered the entrench|ment &s;word in hand, and burned the hou&s;es and

plantations; but the lady, who commanded in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> per&s;on during the action, e&s;caped with &s;ome dif|ficulty. Some of the enemy were killed, and a good number taken: of the Engli&s;h detachment twelve &s;oldiers were &s;lain, and thirty wounded, in|cluding three &s;ubaltern officers, one of whom lo&s;t his arm. The greate&s;t body of the enemy al|ways appeared at the governor's head-quarters, where they had rai&s;ed a redoubt, and thrown up intrenchments. From the&s;e a con&s;iderable detach|ment advanced on the &s;ixth day of February, in the morning, towards the citadel, and fell in with an Engli&s;h party, whom they engaged with great vi|vacity; but after a &s;hort, though warm di&s;pute, they were obliged to retire with &s;ome lo&s;s. With|out all doubt the inhabitants of Guadalupe pur&s;ued the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plan that could po&s;&s;ibly have been projected for their own &s;afety. In&s;tead of hazard|ing a general engagement with regular troops, in which they could have no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, they re&s;olved to weary them out, by maintaining a kind of petty war in &s;eparate parties, to alarm and har|ra&s;s the Engli&s;h with hard duty in a $ultry climate, where they were but indifferently &s;upplied with provi&s;ion and refre&s;hment. Nor were their hopes in this particular di&s;appointed. Both the army and navy were invaded with fevers and other di&s;ea&s;es epidemical in tho&s;e hot countries; and the regi|mental ho&s;pitals were &s;o crouded, that it was judged convenient to &s;end five hundred &s;ick men to the i&s;land of Antigua, where they might be properly attended.</P>

In pur&s;uance of this determi|nation, the great &s;hips were &s;ent round to Grand-terre, in order to reduce this fortification, which they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort Louis re|duced.</NOTE> February. After a &s;evere cannonading, which la&s;ted &s;ix hours, a body of marines being landed, with the Highlanders, they drove the enemy from their intrenchments &s;word-in-hand, and, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, hoi&s;ted the Engli&s;h colours.</P>
<P>In a few days after this exploit, general Hop&s;on dying at Ba&s;&s;e-terre, the chief command devolved to general Barrington, who re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the final reduction of the i&s;land with vigour and di&s;patch. As one &s;tep towards this conque&s;t, the commodore ordered two &s;hips of war to cruize off the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;$atia, and prevent the Dutch traders from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the natives of Guadalupe; whom they had hitherto con&s;$antly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, &s;ince they retired to the mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops re|imbarked at Ba&s;&s;e-terre.</NOTE> General Barrington, on the very fir&s;t day of his command, ordered the troops, who were encamped to &s;trike their tents and hutt, that the enemy might imagine he intended to remain in this quarter; but in a few days, the batteries in and about Ba&s;&s;e-terre were blown up and de&s;troyed, the detach|ments recalled from the advanced po&s;ts, and the whole army reimbarked, except one regiment, with a detachment of artillery, left in garri&s;on at the citadel; the command of which was be&s;towed on colonel Debri&s;ay, an accompli&s;hed officer of great

They afterwards erected a battery, from whence they annoyed this fortification both with &s;hot and &s;hells, and even threatened a regular at|tack; but, as often as they approached the place, they were repul&s;ed by &s;allies from the ca&s;tle. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, the gallant Debri&s;ay, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fate of col.

The confu&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily produced by &s;uch an unfortunate accident, encouraged the enemy to come pouring down from the hills, in or|der to make their advantage of the di&s;a&s;ter; but they were &s;oon repul&s;ed by the fire of the garri&s;on.

<P>This &s;ervice being happily performed, the detach|ment was ordered to force their way to Fort Louis, while the garri&s;on of that ca&s;tle was directed to make two &s;allies, in order to favour their irruption. They accordingly penetrated with &s;ome lo&s;s, &s;uf|tained in forcing a &s;trong pa&s;s, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a battery, which the enemy had rai&s;ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h camp, in the neighbourhood of Fort Louis.</P>
<P>The general, having hitherto &s;ucceeded in his de&s;igns, formed the &s;cheme of &s;urpri&s;ing at one time the three towns of Petit-bourg, Gonoyave, and St. Mary, &s;ituated on the Ba&s;&s;e-terre &s;ide of the little Cul de Sac, and committed the execution of it to the colonels Crump and Clavering: but the night appointed for the &s;ervice, proved exceeding dark and tempe&s;tuous, and the Negro conductors were &s;o frightened, that they ran &s;everal of the flat|bottomed boats on the &s;hoals that &s;kirt this part of the i&s;land. Colonel Clavering landed with about eighty men; but found him&s;elf &s;o entangled with mangrove trees, and the mud &s;o impa&s;&s;ably deep, that he was obliged to reimbark, though not before the enemy had di&s;covered his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This project having mi&s;carried, the general de|tached the &s;ame commanders, who&s;e gallantry and conduct cannot be &s;ufficiently applauded, with a detachment of fifteen hundred men, including one hundred and fifty volunteers from Antigua, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnouville, at the

The ene|my made no oppo&s;ition to their landing; but re|treated, as the Engli&s;h advanced, to a &s;trong in|trenchment thrown up behind the river Lecorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng|li&s;h &s;torm the diffi|cult $o&s;t of Le|corne.</NOTE> a po&s;t of the utmo&s;t importance, as it covered the whole country as far as the bay Mahaut, where provi&s;ions and &s;upplies of all &s;orts were landed from St. Eu&s;tatia. The river was rendered inac|ce&s;&s;ible by a mora&s;s, covered with mangroves, ex|cept at two narrow pa&s;&s;es, which they had fortified with a redoubt, and intrenchments well palli&s;aded, mounted with cannon, and defended by a numerous militia: be&s;ides, the narrow roads, through which only they could be attacked, were interfected with deep and wide ditches. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, the Engli&s;h commanders determined to hazard an a&s;&s;ault. While four field-pieces and two howitzers maintained a con&s;tant fire upon the top of the intr$nchments, the regiment of Duroure and the Highlanders advanced under this cover, firing by platoons with the utmo&s;t regularity. The enemy, intimidated by their cool and re&s;olute beha|viour, began to abandon the fir&s;t intrenchment on the left. Then the Highlanders, drawing their &s;words, and &s;u&s;tained by part of the regiment, threw them&s;elves in with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, and followed the fugitives pell-mell into the re|doubt, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but they &s;till maintained their ground within the intrenchments on the right, from whence they annoyed the a&s;|&s;ailants both with mu&s;quetry and cannon. In half an hour, an occa&s;ional bridge being made, the Engli&s;h troops pa&s;&s;ed the river, in order to attack

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They take Petit|bourg, and St. Mary's.</NOTE> The roads being mended for the pa&s;&s;age of the artillery, the troops advanced towards Petit-bourg, harra&s;&s;ed in their march by flying bodies of the enemy, and arrived late at night on the banks of the river Lizarde, the only ford of which the French had fortified with &s;trong intrenchments, protected by a battery of four cannon, erected on a ri&s;ing ground in the rear. Colonel Clavering, while he amu&s;ed them all night at this place by a con&s;tant fire into their lines, tran&s;ported in two canoes, which he launched about a mile and a half farther down the river, a &s;ufficient number of troops, by day-break, to attack them on the other &s;ide in flank, while he &s;hould advance in front at the head of his little army; but they did not think proper to &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault. On the contrary, they no &s;ooner perceived his intention than they for&s;ook the po&s;t, and fled without order. Colonel Clavering, having pa&s;&s;ed the river, pur&s;ued them to Petit-bourg, which they had al&s;o fortified; and here he found captain Uvedale, of the Grenada bomb$ketch, throwing &s;hells into the redoubt. He forthwith &s;ent detachments to occupy the neigh|bouring heights; a circum&s;tance which the enemy no &s;ooner ob&s;erved than they de&s;erted the place, and retired with great expedition.

At the &s;ame time colonel Crump was detached with &s;even hundred men to the bay of Mahaut, where he burned the town and batteries, which he found abandoned, together with a va&s;t quantity of pro|vi&s;ions, which had been brought from the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatia. Colonel Clavering, having left a &s;mall garri&s;on at Petit&punc;bourg, began his march on the twentieth day of the month towards St. Ma|ry's, where he under&s;tood the enemy had col|lected their whole force, thrown up intrenchments, and rai&s;ed barricadoes; but they had left their rear unguarded. The Engli&s;h commander immediate|ly detached colonel Barlow with a body of troops to attack them from that quarter, while he him|&s;elf advanced again&s;t the front of their intrench|ment. They &s;tood but one cannon-&s;hot, and fled to their lines and batteries at St. Mary's, the flanks of which were covered with woods and precipices. When they perceived the Engli&s;h troops endea|vouring to &s;urmount the&s;e difficulties, and turn their lines, they quitted them, in order to oppo&s;e the de&s;ign; and were immediately attacked with &s;uch vivacity, in the face of a &s;evere fire of mu&s;|quetry and cannon, that they abandoned their ground, and fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, leaving the field and all their artillery to the victors, who took up their quarters for the night at St. Mary's.</P>

<P>The town of Ba&s;&s;e-terre being reduced to a heap of a&s;hes, the inhabitants began to clear away the rubbi&s;h, and erected occa&s;ional &s;heds, where they re&s;umed their &s;everal occupations with that good humour &s;o peculiar to the French nation; and ge|neral Barrington humanely indulged them with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Before this period, commodore Moore having received intelligence that Mr. de Bompart had &s;ailed from Martinique, with de&s;ign to land a re|inforcement on Guadalupe, and that his &s;quadron was &s;een at &s;ea &s;even leagues to windward of Ma|rigalante, he &s;ailed from Prince Rupert's Bay, and turned to windward; but bringing to about noon, he fell to leeward, and lo&s;t as much in the day as he had gained in the night. After having been beaten about for five days, to very little purpo&s;e, he received notice from one of his crui&s;ers, that the French admiral had returned to Martinique; upon which informarion he retired quietly to his former &s;tation in the bay of Dominique: the people of which were &s;o in&s;olent as to affirm, in deri&s;ion, that the Engli&s;h &s;quadron &s;ailed on one &s;ide of the i&s;land, and the French upon the other, that they might be &s;ure of not meeting: but this, without doubt, was an impudent calumny.</P>
<P>General Barrington, having happily fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of Guadalupe, gave notice to the com|modore, that he intended to &s;end back part of the troops with the tran&s;ports to England, about the beginning of July. In con&s;equence of this inti|mation, Mr. Moore &s;ailed with his &s;quadron to Ba&s;&s;e-terre road, where he was next day joined by two &s;hips of the line from England, which ren|dered him greatly &s;uperior in &s;trength to the com|mander of the French &s;quadron, who at this time retired to the i&s;land of Granada, lying about eight leagues from Guadalupe. Here he was di&s;covered by the &s;hip Rippon, who&s;e captain returned im|mediately to Ba&s;&s;e-terre, to make the commodore acquainted with this circum&s;tance: but, before he

<P>General Barrington having made a tour of the i&s;land, in order to vi&s;it and repair the fortifications which he thought nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained, and the affairs relating to the inhabitants being intirely &s;ettled, he &s;ent the Highlanders, with a body of draughts, to North America, under convoy: he garri&s;oned the principal &s;trengths of the i&s;land&punc; and left the chief command to colonel Crump, who had for &s;ome time acted as brigad$er-general, colo|nel Clavering having been &s;ent home to England with the account of the capitulation. Colonel Melville, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in a remark|able manner ever &s;ince their fir&s;t landing, conti|nued governor of the citadel at Ba&s;&s;e-terre; and the command at Grande terre was conferred on colonel Delgarno.

nece&s;&s;ary to explain the &s;teps that were taken on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> this continent, previous to this campaign. In Octo|ber of the preceding year, a grand a&s;&s;embly was held at Ea&s;ton, about ninety miles from Philadel|phia; and there peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed by a formal treaty, between Great-Britain and the &s;everal Na|tions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with the Indians in North America.</NOTE> of Indians inhabiting the country between the Apalachian mountains and the lakes. The Twightwees, however, &s;ettled between the river Ohio and the lakes, did not a&s;&s;i&s;t at this treaty, though &s;ome &s;teps had been taken towards an al|liance with that people. The conferences were managed by the governors of Pen&s;ylvania and New Jer&s;ey&punc; accompanied by Sir William John|&s;on's deputy for Indian affairs, four members of the council of Pen&s;ylvania, &s;ix members of the a&s;&s;embly, two agents for the province of New Jer|&s;ey, a great number of planters, and citizens of Philadelphia, chiefly quakers. They were met by the deputies and chiefs of the Mohawks, Onei|does, Onondagoes, Cayugas, Senecas, Tu&s;caroras, Nanticoques, and Conoys, the Tuteloes, Chugnuts, Delawares, and Unamies, the Mini&s;inks, Mohi|cons, and Wappingers; the whole number, includ|ing their women and children, amounting to five hundred.</P>
<P>Some of the Six Nations, thinking them&s;elves aggrieved by the Briti&s;h coloni&s;ts, who had impri|&s;oned &s;ome individuals of their nation, killed a few, and treated others with contempt, did not fail to expre&s;s their re&s;entment, which had been art|fully fomented by the French emi&s;&s;aries, even into an open rupture. The Delawares and Mini&s;inks, in particular, complained that the Engli&s;h had en|croached
<PB N="162" REF="1630">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> upon their lands, and on that account were provoked to ho&s;tilities: but their chief, Tee|dyu&s;cung, had made overtures of peace; and, in the character of amba&s;&s;ador from all the ten na|tions, had been very in&s;trumental in forming this a&s;&s;embly. The chiefs of the Six Nations, though very well di&s;po&s;ed to peace, took umbrage at the importance a&s;&s;umed by one of the Delawares, over whom, as their de&s;cendants, they exerci&s;ed a kind of parental authority; and on this occa&s;ion they made no &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e their di&s;&s;atisfaction. The bu&s;ine&s;s therefore of the Engli&s;h governors, at this congre&s;s, was to a&s;certain the limits of the lands in di&s;pute, reconcile the Six Nations with their nephews the Delawares, remove every cau&s;e of mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Engli&s;h and the In|dians, detach the&s;e &s;avages intirely from the French intere&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;h a firm peace, and induce them to exert their influence in per&s;uading the Twigh|twees to accede to this treaty. Tho&s;e Indians, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of few ideas, circum&s;cribed in their mental faculties, &s;tupid, brutal, and fero|cious, conduct them&s;elves, neverthele&s;s, in matters of importance to the community, by the general maxims of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; and their treaties are always founded upon good &s;en&s;e conveyed in a very ridiculous manner. Their language is gut|tural, har&s;h, and poly&s;yllabical; and their &s;peech con&s;i&s;ts of hyperbolical metaphors and &s;imiles, which inve&s;t it with an air of dignity, and heighten the expre&s;&s;ion. They manage their conferences by means of wampum, a kind of bead, formed of hard &s;hell, either in &s;ingle &s;trings, or &s;ewed in broad belts of different dimen&s;ions, according to

<P>Brethren, I now &s;peak on|ly for my own nation, I will hide nothing from you; the French, like a thief in the night, have &s;tolen &s;ome of our young men, and corrupt|ed them to do mi&s;chief. Our chiefs held them fa&s;t, but the French artfully unloo&s;ed them; we take out of your heads the hatchet with which they have &s;truck you, and are &s;orry for what they have done.</P>

<P>The Mohawk chiefs hav|ing fini&s;hed their &s;peech, as coun&s;ellors, their warriors &s;poke by the mouth of Tho|mas King:</P>
<P>`Brethren, you have been de&s;irous to know the true cau&s;e of the war, and of the bitterne&s;s of our hearts. Look well about you, and you will find you ga$e the fir&s;t offence. In time of profound peace, &s;ome of the Shawane&s;e pa&s;&s;ing through S. Carolina to go to war with their enemies, as their yearly cu&s;tom is, were per&s;uaded in a friendly man|ner into your hou&s;es, deceit|fully and unju&s;tifiably dragged to pri&s;on, where one, who was a head man, le&s;t h s life, and the others were &s;everely u&s;ed. This fir&s;t rai&s;ed ill-will in the minds of the Shawane&s;e; the French aggravated the of|fence; put the hatchet into their hands to revenge the blood of their brother; they be&s;ought the Delawares to join them to make the blow $all the heavier; and by de|gress the young men among us were $$i$red to vengeance.</P>
<P>Brethen&punc; this was the ca&s;e of the Shawane&s;e. Another of the like nature happened about three years ago to the Sen$$as, when eight of their warriors were returning from war&punc; with &s;even pri&s;oners and &s;eales with them, through Virginia; the&s;e, at a place called Green Briar, met a party of &s;oldiers, not le&s;s than 150, who kindly invited them to a certain &s;tore, and &s;aid, they would &s;upply them with provi&s;ions; two days they travelled with them in a friendly manner, but when they came to the hou&s;e on the third, they began to di&s;|arm them; the head man cried out, Here is death; de|fend your&s;elves; two of them were killed on the &s;pot, and one, a boy, was taken pri&s;o|ner. As this was upon the warriors road in time of pro|found peace, judge ye of the degree of provocation. Bre|thren, you have ju&s;tly de|manded your pri&s;oners; it is right &s;o to do; and, if this unhappy boy is alive, as we have rea&s;on to think he is, we de&s;ire you may return him. If he is dead, we are content. His name is Squi&s;&s;atago.</P>
<BIBL>Six &s;trings of wampum.</BIBL>
<P>Brethren, the cau&s;e why the Indians at Ohio left you was owing to your&s;elves; when we heard of the French coming there, we de&s;ired the governors of Virginia and Pen&s;ylvania to &s;upply us with implements and nece&s;&s;aries for war, and we would defend our lands; but the&s;e gover|nors di&s;regarded our me&s;&s;age; the French came to us; trad|ed with our people; u&s;ed them kindly; and gained their affections.

<P>Brother, [addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the governor of Jer&s;ey] our cou&s;ins the Mini&s;inks tell us, they were wronged of a great deal of land, and pu&s;hed back by the Engli&s;h &s;ettling &s;o fa&s;t upon them, &s;o as not to know whether they have any lands or no. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild creatures, and will not let us come on your lands &s;o much as to bunt after them; you will not let us peel a &s;in|gle tree. Surely, this is hard. You take of us what lands you plea&s;e, and the cattle you rai&s;e on them are your own; but tho&s;e that are wild are &s;till ours, and &s;hould be com|mon to both; for our ne|phews when they &s;old the land, did not purpo&s;e to deprive them&s;elves of hunting the wild deer, or u&s;ing a &s;tick of wood.

<P>Teedyu&s;cung.] `Uncles, ac|cording to the ancient cu&s;tom, we u&s;ed to &s;peak one to an|other at home; but now I mu&s;t &s;peak to you in the pre|&s;ence of the Engli&s;h gover|nors.

<P>Then Egohohowen (the Mini&s;ink chief) addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the governor, and &s;aid, We are now &s;atisfied, and we &s;till retain a friend|&s;hip for the Engli&s;h; and we de&s;ire that if we &s;hould come into your province to &s;ee our old friends, and &s;hould have occa&s;ion for the ba$k of a tree to cover a cabin, or a little re|fre&s;hment, that we &s;hould not be denied, but be treated as brethren; and that your peo|ple may not look on the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, or fi&s;h of the waters, as their &s;ole pro|perty, but that we may be ad|mitted to an equal u&s;e of them.'</P>

<P>Then governor Barnard, reque&s;ting the attention of the Indians, acquainted them, that in con&s;equence of their advice, he had come to a full agreement with the Mini&s;inks, for all the lands in di&s;pute on the part of his province, to which he de&s;ired they would pay a particular regard, that the remembrance of it might never be forgotten. <BIBL>A belt.</BIBL></P>

In&s;tead of employing the whole &s;trength of the Briti&s;h arms in North America again&s;t one object, the mini&s;try propo&s;ed to divide the forces, and make impre&s;&s;ions on three different parts at once, that the enemy might be divided, di&s;tracted, and weakened, and the conque&s;t of Canada com|pleated in one campaign. That the &s;ucce&s;s might be the more certain, the different expeditions were planned in &s;uch a manner as to co-operate with each other, and even join occa&s;ionally; &s;o practi|cable was it thought for them to maintain &s;uch a corre&s;pondence as would admit of a junction of this nature. The project of this campaign imported, that general Wolfe, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf &s;o eminently in the &s;iege of Loui&s;bourg, &s;hould proceed up the river St. Laurence, as &s;oon as the navigation &s;hould be clear of ice, with a body of eight thou&s;and men, and a con&s;iderable &s;quadron of &s;hips from England, to undertake the &s;iege of Quebec, the capital of Canada: that general Am|her&s;t, who commanded in chief, &s;hould, with an|other army of regular troops and provincials, amounting to twelve thou&s;and men, reduce Ticon|de$oga and Crown point, cro&s;s the lake Cham|plain, and, proceeding along the river Ri$helieu to the banks of St. Laurence, join general Wolfe in the &s;iege of Quebec; that brigadier-general Pri|deaux, with a third body, reinforced by a con&s;i|derable number of friendly Indians, a&s;&s;embled by the influence and under the command of Sir Wil|liam John&s;on, &s;hould inve&s;t the French fort, erect|ed by the fall $$$cataract of Niagara, which was
<PB N="171" REF="1720">
certainly the mo&s;t important po&s;t of all French<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> America, as it in a manner commands all the in|terior patts of that va&s;t continent. It overawes the whole country of the Six Nations, who were cajoled into a tame acquie&s;cence in its being built on their territory: it &s;ecured all the inland trade, the navigation of the great lakes, the communica|tion between Canada and Loui&s;iana, and opened a pa&s;&s;age for inroads into the colonies of Great-Bri|tain. It was propo&s;ed, that the Briti&s;h forces, having reduced Niagara, might be embarked on the lake Ontario, fall down the river St. Laurence, be&s;iege and take Montreal, and then join or co-operate with Amher&s;t's army. Be&s;ides the&s;e larger armaments, colonel Stanwix commanded a &s;maller detachment for reducing &s;maller forts, and &s;cour|ing the banks of the lake Ontario.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Animad|ver&s;ions on that plan.</NOTE> How far this project was &s;ounded on rea&s;on and military knowledge, may be judged by the follow|ing particulars, of which the projectors were not ignorant. The navigation of the river St. Lau|rence is dangerous and uncertain. The city of Que|bec was remarkably &s;trong, from &s;ituation and fortification, from the bravery of the inhabitants, and the number of the garri&s;on. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm, an officer of great courage and activity, kept the field between Montreal and Quebec with a body of ten thou&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ting of regular troops and di&s;ciplined militia, reinforced by a con&s;iderable number of armed Indians; and an|other body of re&s;erve hovered in the neighbour|hood of Montreal, which was the re&s;idence of mon|&s;ieur de Vaudreuil, governor-general of Canada. The garri&s;on of Niagara con&s;i&s;ted of above &s;ix
<PB N="172" REF="1730">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> hundred men; the march to it was tedious and embarra&s;&s;ed; and mon&s;ieur de Levi &s;coured the country with a flying detachment, well acquainted with all the woods and pa&s;&s;es. With re&s;pect to ge|neral Amher&s;t's &s;hare of the plan, the $orts of Ticon|deroga and Crown&punc;point &s;tood in his way. The enemy were ma&s;ters of the lake Champlain, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;trong fort of Chambly, by the fall of the river Richelieu, which defended the pa&s;s to the river St. Laurence. Even had the&s;e ob&s;tacles been removed, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible that he and Mr. Wolfe &s;hould arrive at Quebec in the &s;ame in&s;tant of time. The fir&s;t that reached it, far from being in a condition to undertake the &s;iege of Quebec, would run the ri&s;que of being engaged and de|feated by the covering army: in which ca&s;e, the other body mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent hazard of de&s;truction, in the mid&s;t of an enemy's country, far di&s;tant from any place of &s;afety to which it could retreat. Had the&s;e di&s;a&s;|ters happened, and, according to the experience of war, they were the natural con&s;equences of the &s;cheme, the troops at Niagara would in all pro|bability have fallen an ea&s;y &s;acrifice, unle&s;s they had been &s;o fortunate as to receive intelligence time enough to accompli&s;h their retreat before they could be intercepted. The de&s;ign would, we ap|p$ehend, have been more ju&s;tifiable, or at lea&s;t not $o liable to objection, had Mr. Amher&s;t left two or three regiments to protect the frontiers of New York, and joining Mr. Wolfe with the re&s;t, &s;ailed up the river St. Laurence to be&s;iege Quebec. Even in that ca&s;e, the whole number of his troops would not have been &s;u$$$$ient, according to the

articles of war, to inve&s;t the place, and cope with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the covering army. Neverthele&s;s, had the enter|prize &s;ucceeded, Montcalm mu&s;t either have hazarded an engagement again&s;t great odds, or retired farther into the country: then the route would have been open by land and water to Mont|real, which could have made little re&s;i&s;tance. The two principal towns being taken, and the naviga|tion of St. Laurence blocked up, all the dependant forts mu&s;t have &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion, except Niagara, which there was a bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;up|plying, at an incredible trouble and expence, from the di&s;tant Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; but, even then, it might have been be&s;ieged in form, and ea&s;ily reduced. Whatever defects there might have been in the plan, the execution, though it mi&s;carried in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential points, was attended with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame good fortune that pro&s;pered the Bri|ti&s;h arms &s;o remarkably in the conque&s;t of Guada|lupe, &s;eemed to interpo&s;e &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hingly in their favour at Quebec, the &s;iege of which we &s;hall record in its proper place: at pre&s;ent we mu&s;t attend the operations of general Amher&s;t, who&s;e &s;eparate army was fir&s;t in motion, though &s;uch im|pediments were thrown in his way as greatly re|tarded the progre&s;s of his operations; impedi|ments &s;aid to have ari&s;en from the pride, in&s;olence, and ob&s;tinacy of certain individuals, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great influence in that part of the world, and em|ployed it all to thwart the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer was already far advanced before general Amher&s;t could pa&s;s lake George with his

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> forces, although they met with no oppo&s;ition, and reach the neighbourhood of Ticonderoga, where, in the preceding year, the Briti&s;h troops had &s;u&s;|tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">The forts of Ticon|deroga and Crown-point a|bandoned by the enemy.</NOTE> &s;uch a terrible di&s;a&s;ter. At fir&s;t the enemy &s;eemed determined to defend this fortre&s;s; but per|ceiving the Engli&s;h commander re&s;olute, cautious, and well prepared for undertaking the &s;iege, hav|ing moreover orders to retreat from place to place, towards the centre of operations at Quebec, rather than run the lea&s;t ri&s;k of being made pri&s;oners of war, they in the night of July the twenty-&s;eventh abandoned the po&s;t, after having in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;mantled the fortifications, and retired to Crown-point, a fort &s;ituated on the verge of Lake Cham|plain. General Amher&s;t, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this important po&s;t, which effectually covered the frontiers of New York, and &s;ecured to him&s;elf a &s;afe retreat in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, ordered the works to be repaired, and allotted a &s;trong garri&s;on for its defence. This acqui&s;ition, however, was not made without the lo&s;s of a brave accompli&s;hed young of|ficer colonel Roger Town&s;hend, who, in reconnoi|tring the fort, was killed with a cannon &s;hot, and fell near the &s;ame &s;pot which in the former year had been enriched with the blood of the gallant lord Howe, whom he &s;trongly re&s;embled in the circum&s;tances of birth, age, qualifications, and cha|racter. While the general &s;uperintended the re|pairs of Ticonderoga, and the men were employed in preparing batteaus and other ve&s;&s;els, his &s;couting parties hovered in the neighbourhood of Crown-point, in order to watch the motion of the enemy. From one of the&s;e detachments, he received in|telligence on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, that the
<PB N="175" REF="1760">
enemy had retired from Crown-point. He imme|diately<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> detached a body of rangers before him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, embarked with the re&s;t of the army, and on the fourth day of the month, landed at the fort, where the troops were immediately encamped. His next care was to lay the foundations of a new fort, to be maintained for the farther &s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h dominions in that part of the country, and particularly for preventing the inroads of &s;calping parties, by whom the planta|tions had been dreadfully infe&s;ted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General Amher&s;t embarks on the lake Cham|plain.</NOTE> Here information was received that the enemy had retired to the i&s;le Aux Noix, at the other end of the lake Champlain, five leagues on the hither &s;ide of St. John's; that their force encamped in that place, under the command of Mr. de Burle|maque, con&s;i&s;ted of three battalions and five pi|quets of regular troops, with Canadians and ma|rines, amounting in the whole to three thou&s;and five hundred effective men, provided with nu|merous artillery; and that the lake was occupied by four large ve&s;&s;els mounted with cannon, and manned with piquets of different regiments, under the command and direction of Mr. le Bras, a cap|tain in the French navy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. de Rigal, and other &s;ea-officers. In con&s;equence of this inti|mation, general Amher&s;t, who had for &s;ome time employed captain Loring to &s;uperintend the build|ing of ve&s;&s;els at Ticonderoga, being re&s;olved to have the &s;uperiority on the lake, directed the cap|tain to build with all po&s;&s;ible expedition a &s;loop of &s;ixteen guns, and a radeau eighty&punc;four feet in length, capable of carrying &s;ix large cannon. The&s;e, together with a brigantine, being fini&s;hed,
<PB N="176" REF="1770">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> victualled, and manned by the eleventh day of Oc|tober, the general embarked with the whole troops in batteaus, in order to attack the enemy; but next day, the weather growing tempe&s;tuous, was obliged to take &s;helter in a bay on the we&s;tern &s;hore, where the men were landed for refre&s;hment. In the mean time, capt. Loring with his &s;mall &s;qua|dron &s;ailed down the lake, gave chace to a French &s;chooner, and drove three of their &s;hips into a bay, where two of them were &s;unk, and the third run a&punc;ground by their own crews, who e&s;caped: one, however, was repaired and brought away by capt. Loring, &s;o that now the French had but one &s;chooner remaining. General Amher&s;t, after hav|ing been &s;ome days wind-bound, reimbarked his forces, and proceeded down the lake; but the &s;torm, which had abated, beginning to blow with redoubled fury, &s;o as to &s;well the waves mountain high, the &s;ea&s;on for action being elap&s;ed, and winter &s;etting in with the mo&s;t rigorous &s;everity, he &s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of accompli&s;hing his de|&s;ign, and was obliged to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Returning to the &s;ame bay where he had been &s;heltered, he landed the troops, and began his march for Crown-point, where he arrived on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October. Having &s;ecured a &s;uperiority on the lake, he now employed all his attention in rearing the new fortre&s;s at Crown-point, together with three &s;mall out-forts for its better defence; in opening roads of communica|tion with Ticonderoga, and the governments of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, and New Hamp&s;hire; and in mak|ing di&s;po&s;itions for the winter-quarters of his troops, &s;o as to protect the country from the in|roads

<P>Though Mr. Amher&s;t was ignorant of the pro|ceedings of the Quebec &s;quadron, his communica|tion continued open with the forces which under|took the &s;iege of Niagara; and he received an ac|count of their &s;ucce&s;s before he had quitted the lines of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>General Prideaux, with his body of troops, re|inforced by the Indian auxiliaries under Sir Wil|liam John&s;on, advanced to the cataract of Niagara, without being expo&s;ed to the lea&s;t inconvenience on his march; and inve&s;ting the French fortre&s;s about the middle of July, carried on his approaches with great vigour, till the twentieth day of that month, when, vi&s;iting the trenches, he was unfor|tunately &s;lain by the bur&s;t ing of a cohorn.

The enemy, alarmed with the ap|prehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing a place of &s;uch importance, re&s;olved to exert their$endeavours for its relief. They a&s;&s;embled a body of regular troops, amount|ing to twelve hundred men, drawn from Detroit, Venango, and Pre&s;que I&s;le; and the&s;e, with a number of Indian auxiliaries, were detached, under the command of mon&s;ieur d'Aubry, on an attempt to reinforce the garri&s;on of Niagara. Sir William John&s;on, having received intelligence of their de|&s;ign, made a di&s;po&s;ition to intercept them in their march. In the evening he ordered the light in|fantry and piquets to po&s;t them&s;elves to the left, on the road leading from Niagara falls to the for|tre&s;s; and the&s;e were reinforced in the morning with the grenadiers, and part of the forty-&s;ixth re|giment, commanded by lieutenant&punc;colonel Ma&s;&s;ey&punc; and another regiment, under lieutenant colone$ Fa$quhar, was po&s;ted at the tail of the works, in order to &s;upport the guard of the trenches. About eight in the morning, the enemy being in &s;ight, the Indians in the Engli&s;h army advanced to &s;peak with their countrymen, who &s;erved under the French banners; but this conference was declined by the enemy. Then the French Indians having uttered the horrible &s;cream called the war-whoop, which by this time had lo&s;t its effect among the Briti&s;h forces, the enemy began the action with great impetuo&s;ity: but they met with &s;uch a hot reception in front, while the Indian auxiliaries fell upon their flanks, that in little more than half an hour their whole army was routed, their general&punc;

The commandant, having certified him&s;elf of the truth, by &s;ending an officer to vi&s;it the pri&s;oners, agreed to treat, and in a few hours the capitulation was ratified. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix hundred and &s;even effective men, marched out with the honours of war, in order to be embarked in ve&s;&s;els on the lake, and conveyed in the mo&s;t expeditious manner to New York. They laid down their arms when they embarked; but were permitted to keep their baggage, and, by a proper e&s;corte, protected from the &s;avage in&s;o|lence and rapacity of the Indians.

<P>This was the &s;econd compleat victory obtained on the continent of North America, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame war, by Sir William John&s;on, who, without the help of a military education, &s;ucceeded &s;o &s;ignally in the field by ding of innate courage and natural &s;agacity.

Sir William John|&s;on was not more &s;erviceable to his country by his valour and conduct in the field, than by the influence and authority which his ju&s;tice, benevolence, and integrity had acquired among the Indian tribes of the Six Nations, whom he not only a&s;&s;embled at Niagara, to the number of eleven hundred, but al&s;o re&s;trained within the bounds of good order and moderation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc|tion to the expedi|tion again&s;t Quebec.</NOTE> The reduction of Niagara, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown-point, were exploits much more ea&s;ily at|chieved than the conque&s;t of Quebec, the great object to which all the&s;e operations were &s;ubordi|nate.

It was about the middle of February that a con&s;i|derable &s;quadron &s;ailed from England for Cape Breton, under the command of the admirals Saun|ders and Holmes, two gentlemen of worth and probity, who had on &s;everal occa&s;ions &s;ignalized their courage and conduct in the &s;ervice of their country. By the twenty-fir&s;t day of April they were in &s;ight of Loui&s;bourg; but the harbour was blocked up with ice in &s;uch a manner, that they were obliged to bear away for Halifax in Nova-Scotia.

Mean while, admiral Saun|ders arrived at Loui&s;bourg; and the troops being embarked, to the number of eight thou&s;and, pro|ceeded up the river without further delay. The operations at land were intru&s;ted to the conduct of major-general James Wolfe, who&s;e talents had &s;hone with &s;uch &s;uperior lu&s;tre at the &s;iege of Louisbourg; and his &s;ubordinates in command were the brigadiers Monckton, Town&s;hend, and Murray; all four in the flower of their age, who had &s;tudied the military art with equal eagerne&s;s and proficiency, and, though young in years, were old in experience.

The &s;ituation of brigadier Town&s;hend was &s;ingular: he had &s;erved abroad in the la&s;t war with reputation, and re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion during the peace, in di&s;dain of &s;ome hard u&s;age he had &s;u&s;tained from his &s;uperiors.

Their good fortune in this particular, indeed, was owing to &s;ome excellent charts of the river, which had been found in ve&s;&s;els taken from the enemy. About the latter end of June the land-forces were di&s;embarked in two divi&s;ions upon the i&s;le of Or|leans, &s;ituated a little below Quebec, a large fertile i&s;land, well cultivated, producing plenty of grain, abounding with people, villages, and plantations. General Wolfe no &s;ooner landed on the i&s;land of Orleans than he di&s;tributed a manife&s;to among the French coloni&s;ts, importing, That the king his ma&s;ter, ju&s;tly exa&s;perated again&s;t the French mo|narch, had equipped a con&s;iderable armament, in order to humble his pride, and was determined to reduce the mo&s;t con&s;iderable French &s;ettlements in America.

He ob&s;erved, that the Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters of the river St. Laurence, &s;o as to intercept all &s;uccours from Europe; and had, be&s;ides, a powerful army on the continent, under the command of general Amher&s;t. He affirmed, That the re&s;olution they ought to take was neither difficult nor doubtful, as the utmo&s;t exertion of their valour would be u&s;e|le&s;s, and &s;erve only to deprive them of the ad|vantages which they might reap from their neutra|lity. He reminded them, that the cruelties exer|ci&s;ed by the French upon the &s;ubjects of Great Bri|tain in America, would excu&s;e the mo&s;t &s;evere re|pri&s;als; but Britons were too generous to follow &s;uch barbarous examples. He again offered to the Canadians the &s;weets of peace, amid&s;t the hor|rors of war; and left it to them&s;elves to determine their own fate by their own conduct. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed his hope, that the world would do him ju&s;tice, &s;hould they oblige him, by rejecting the&s;e favourable terms, to adopt violent mea&s;ures. He expatiated upon the &s;trength and power, as well as the genero&s;ity of Great Britain, in thus &s;tretching out the hand of humanity; a hand ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them on all occa&s;ions, even when France was, by her weakne&s;s, compelled to abandon them in the

Mr. Wolfe was well acquainted with all the difficulties of the undertaking; but he knew at the &s;ame time he &s;hould always have it in his power to retreat, in ca&s;e of emergency, while the Briti&s;h &s;quadron maintained its &s;tation in the river: he was not with|out hope of being joined by general Amher&s;t; and he was &s;timulated by an appetite for glory, which the pro&s;pect of accumulated dangers could not allay. Under&s;tanding that there was a body of the enemy po&s;ted, with cannon, at the Point of Levi, on the &s;outh &s;hore, oppo&s;ite to the city of Quebec, he detached again&s;t them brigadier Monckton, at the head of four battalions, who pa&s;&s;ed the river at night; and next morning, having &s;kirmi&s;hed with &s;ome of the enemy's irregulars, obliged them to retire from that po&s;t, which the Engli&s;h immediately occupied. At the &s;ame time colonel Carlton, with another detachment, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the we&s;tern point of the i&s;land of Orleans; and both the&s;e po&s;ts were fortified, in order to anticipate the enemy, who, had they kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either, might have rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible for any &s;hip to lie at anchor within &punc;two miles of Quebec. Be&s;ides, the Point of Levi was within cannon-&s;hot of the city, again&s;t which a battery of mortars and artillery was immediately erected. Montcalm, fore&s;eeing the effect of this expedient, detached a body of &s;ixteen hundred men acro&s;s the river, to attack and de&s;troy the works before they were completed: but this detachment fell into di&s;|order,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet endan|gered by a &s;torm.</NOTE> In the mean time the fleet was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger. Immediately after the troops had been landed on the i&s;land of Orleans, the wind increa&s;ed to a furious &s;torm, which blew with &s;uch violence, that many tran&s;ports ran foul of one another, and were di&s;abled; a number of boats and &s;mall craft foundered, and divers large &s;hips lo&s;t their anchors.

The rea&s;ons that induced general Wolfe to choo&s;e this &s;itua|tion by the falls of Montmorenci, in which he was divided from Quebec by this, and another river called St. Charles, he explained in a letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. He ob&s;erved that the ground which he had cho&s;en was high, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure commanded the oppo&s;ite &s;ide on which the enemy was po&s;ted: that there was a ford below the falls, pa&s;&s;able in every tide for &s;ome hours at the latter part of the ebb, and beginning of the flood; and he hoped that means might be found of pa&s;&s;ing the river higher up, &s;o as to fight the mar|quis de Montcalm upon le&s;s di&s;advantageous terms than tho&s;e of directly attacking his intrenchments. Accordingly, in reconnoitring the river Montmo|r$nci, a ford was di&s;covered about three miles above; but the oppo&s;ite bank, which was naturally &s;leep and covered with woods, the enemy had in|trenched in &s;uch a manner as to render it almo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible. The e&s;corte was twice attacked by the Indians, who were as often repul&s;ed; but the&s;e rencounters co&s;t the Engli&s;h about forty men killed and wounded, including &s;ome officers.</P>
<P>Some &s;hrewd objections might be &s;tarted to the general's choice of ground on this occa&s;ion. He could not act at all without pa&s;&s;ing the river Mont|morenci at a very great di&s;advantage, and attack|ing an enemy &s;uperior to him&s;elf in number, &s;e|cured

Had his good fortune enabled him to &s;urmount all the&s;e difficulties, and after all to defeat the enemy in a pitched battle, the garri&s;on of Quebec might have been reinforced by the wreck of their army; and he could not, with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, have undertaken the &s;iege of an exten&s;ive fortified place, which he had not troops &s;ufficient to inve&s;t, and who&s;e garri&s;on would have been nearly equal in number to the &s;um total of the troops he com|manded. At any rate, the chance of a fair engage|ment in the open field was what he had little rea&s;on to expect in that &s;ituation, from the known expe|rience, and the apparent conduct of the French ge|neral. The&s;e objections appeared &s;o obvious and important, that general Wolfe would not deter|mine to ri&s;que an attack, until he had &s;urveyed the upper part of the river St. Laurence, in hope of finding &s;ome place more favourable for a de&s;cent.</P>

His de&s;ign was, fir&s;t to reduce a detached redoubt clo&s;e to the water's edge; &s;eemingly &s;itu|ated without gun-&s;hot of the intrenchment on the hill. Should this fortification be &s;upported by the enemy, he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould be able to bring on a general engagement: on the con|trary, &s;hould they remain tame &s;pectators of its reduction, he could afterwards examine ther &s;itu|ation at lei&s;ure, and determine the place at which they could be mo&s;t ea&s;ily attacked. Preparations were accordingly made for &s;torming the redoubt. On the la&s;t day of July, in the forenoon, part of brigadier Monckton's brigade was embarked in the
<PB N="191" REF="1940">
boats of the fleet, to be tran&s;ported from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Point of Levi. The two brigades commanded by the brigadiers Town&s;hend and Murray were drawn out in order to pa&s;s the ford, when it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. To facilitate their pa&s;&s;age, the admiral had &s;tationed the Centurion &s;hip of war in the channel, to check the fire of the lower battery, by which the ford was commanded: a numerous train of artillery was placed upon the eminence, to batter and enfilade the left of the enemy's intrenchment; and two flat-bottomed armed ve&s;&s;els, prepared for the purpo&s;e, were run a|ground near the redoubt, to favour the de&s;cent of the forces. The manife&s;t confu&s;ion produced among the French by the&s;e previous mea&s;ures, and by the fire of the Centurion, which was well directed and &s;u&s;tained, determined Mr. Wolfe to &s;torm this intrenchment without further delay. Orders were i&s;&s;ued, that the three brigadiers &s;hould put their troops in motion at a certain &s;ignal, which was accordingly made at a proper time of the tide. Many of the boats from Point Levi, ran aground upon a ledge, that runs off a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore; and this accident occa&s;ioned a di&s;|order, by which &s;o much time was lo&s;t, that the general was obliged to &s;top the march of briga|dier Town&s;hend's corps, which he perceived to be in motion. In the mean time, the boats were floated, and ranged in proper order, though ex|po&s;ed to a &s;evere fire of &s;hot and &s;hells; and the general in per&s;on &s;ounding the &s;hore, pointed out the place where the troops might di&s;embark with the lea&s;t difficulty. Thirteen companies of grena|diers, and two hundred men of the &s;econd Ame|rican

They had received orders to form in four di&s;tinct bodies, and begin the attack, &s;upported by the corps of bri|gadier Monckton, as &s;oon as the other troops &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the ford,' and be near enough to con|tribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e in&s;tructions, how|ever, were intirely neglected. Before Mr. Monck|ton had landed, and while brigadier Town&s;hend was on his march at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, the grenadiers, without waiting to be drawn up in any regular form, impetuou&s;ly ru&s;hed towards the ene|my's intrenchments in the utmo&s;t di&s;order.

The fir&s;t fire they received did &s;uch execution among them, that they were obliged to &s;helter them&s;elves under the redoubt which the French had abandoned at their approach. In this uncom|fortable &s;ituation they remained &s;ome time, unable to form under &s;o hot a fire, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of many gallant officers, who la|vi&s;hly expo&s;ed, and even lo&s;t their $ives in the ho|nourable di&s;charge of their duty <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following anecdote is &s;o remarkable, and tends &s;o much to the honour of the Briti&s;h &s;oldiery, that we in&s;ert it without fear of the rea|der's di&s;approbation. Capt. Ochterlony and en&s;ign Pey|ton belonged to the regiment of brigadier general Monck|ton. They were nearly of an age, which did not exceed thirty: the fir&s;t was a North Briton, the other a native of Ireland. Both were agreeable in per&s;on, and unblemi&s;hed in character, and connected together by the ties of mutual friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. On the day that preceded the battle, capt. Ochterlony ha$ been obliged to fight a duel with a German officer; in which, though he wounded and di&s;armed his antagoni&s;t, yet he him&s;elf received a dan|gerous hurt under the right arm; in con&s;equence of which his friends in&s;i&s;ted on his re|maining in camp during the action of next day; but his &s;pirit was too great to com|ply with this remon&s;trance. He declared it &s;hould never be &s;aid that a &s;eratch, receiv|ed in a private rencounter, had prevented him from do|ing his duty, when his coun|try required his &s;ervice; and he took the field with a fu&s;il in his hand, though he was hardly able to carry his arms. In leading up his men to the enemy's entrenchment, he was &s;hot through the lungs with a mu&s;ket-ball; an acci|dent which obliged him to part with his fu&s;il: but he &s;till continued advancing, un|til, by lo&s;s of blood, he be|came too weak to proceed further. About the &s;ame time Mr. Peyton was lamed by a &s;hot which &s;hattered the &s;mall bone of his left leg. The &s;oldiers, in their retreat, earne&s;tly begged, with tears in their eyes, that capt. Och|terlony would allow them to carry him and the en&s;ign off the field. But he was &s;o biggoted to a &s;evere point of honour, that he would not quit the ground, though he de&s;ired they would take care of his en&s;ign. Mr. Peyton, with a generous di&s;dain, re|jected their good offices, de|claring that he would not leave his captain in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and in a little time they remained the &s;ole &s;ur|vivors on that part of the field.</P>
<P>Capt. Ochterlony &s;at down by his friend, and, as they expected nothing but imme|diate death, they took leave of each other: yet they were not altogether abandoned by the hope of being protected as pri&s;oners: for the captain &s;eeing a French &s;oldier with two Indians approach, &s;tarted up, and acco&s;ting them in the French language, which he &s;poke perfectly well, expre&s;&s;|ed his expectation that they would treat him and his com|panion as officers, pri&s;oners, and gentlemen. The two Indians &s;eemed to be intire|ly under the conduct of the Frenchman, who coming up to Mr. Peyton, as he &s;at on the ground, &s;natched his laced hat from his head, and robbed the captain of his watch and money. This outrage was a &s;ignal to the Indians for mur|der and pillage. One of them, clubbing his firelock, &s;truck at him behind, with a view to knock him down; but the blow mi&s;&s;ing his head, took place upon his &s;houlder. At the &s;ame in|&s;tant the other Indian poured his &s;hot into the brea&s;t of this unfertunate young gentle|man, who cried out, <Q>&startq;O Peyton $ the villian has &s;hot me.&endq;</Q> Not yet &s;atisfied with cruelty, the barbarian &s;prung upon him&punc; and &s;tabb|ed him in the belly with his &s;calping knife. The captain, having parted with his $u&s;il, had no weapon for his de|fence, as none of the officers wore &s;words in the action. The three ruffians&punc; finding him &s;till alive, endeavoured to &s;trangle him with his own $a&s;n; and he was now upon his knees, &s;truggling again&s;t them with &s;urpri&s;ing exertion. Mr. Peyton, at this juncture, having a double barrelled mu&s;ket in his hand, and &s;ee|ing the di&s;tre&s;s of his friend, fired at one of the Indians, who dropped dead upon the &s;pot. The other thinking the en&s;ign would now be an ea&s;y prey, advanced towards him; and Mr. Peyton, having taken good aim at the di&s;tance of four yards, di&s;charged his piece the &s;econd time; but it &s;eemed to take no effect. The &s;avage fired in his turn, and wounded the en&s;ign in the &s;houlder; then ru&s;hing upon him, thru&s;t his bayonet through his body. He re|peated the blow, which Mr. Peyton attempting to parry, received another wound in his left hand. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;eized the Indian's mu&s;ket with the &s;ame hand, pulling him forwards, and with his right drawing a dagger which hung by his &s;ide, plunged it in the barbarian's &s;ide. A violent &s;truggle en&s;ued: but at length Mr. Peyton was up|permo&s;t, and, with repeated &s;trokes of his dagger, killed his antagoni&s;t outright. Here he was &s;eized with an unac|countable emotion of cutio|&s;ity, to know whether or not his &s;hot had taken place on the body of the Indian; he accordingly turned him up, and, &s;tripping off his blanket, perceived that the ball had penetrated quite through the cavity of the brea&s;t. Having thus obtained a dear-bought victory, he &s;tarted up on one leg, and &s;aw capt. Ochterlony &s;tanding at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty yards, clo&s;e by the e|nemy's brea&s;twork, with the French &s;oldier attending him. Mr. Peyton then called aloud, "Capt. Ochterlony, I am glad to &s;ee you have at la&s;t got un|der protection. Beware of that villain, who is more barbarous than the &s;avages. God ble&s;s you, my dear cap|tain. I &s;ee a party of Indians coming this way, and expect to be murdered immediate|ly." A number of tho&s;e bar|barians had for &s;ome time been employed on the left in &s;calping and pillaging the dy|ing and the dead that were left upon the field of battle; and above thirty of the&s;e banditti were in full march to de&s;troy Mr. Peyton. This gentleman knew he had no mercy to ex|pect; for, &s;hould his life be &s;pared for the pre&s;ent, they would have afterwards in&s;i&s;t|ed upon &s;acrificing him to the manes of their brethren whom he had &s;iain; and, in that ca&s;e, he would have been put to death by the mo&s;t ex|cruciating tortures. Full of this idea, he &s;natched up his mu&s;ket, and&punc; notwith&s;tand|ing his broken leg, can above forty yards without hal$ing: &s;eeling him&s;elf now totally di&s;abled, and incapable of proceeding one &s;tep farther, he loaded his piece, and pre|&s;ented it to the two foremo&s;t Indians, who &s;tood aloof, waiting to be joined by their fellows: while the French, from their brea&s;twork, kept up a continual fare of cannon and &s;mall arms upon this poor &s;olitary, maimed gen|tleman. In this uncomforta|ble &s;ituation he &s;tood, when he di&s;cerned at a di&s;tance an highland officer, with a party of his men, &s;kirting the plan towards the field of battle. He forthwith waved his hand in &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, and be|ing perceived by the officer, he detached three of his men to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e brave fellows ha&s;tened to him thro' the mid&s;t of a terrible fire, and one of them bore him
off on his &s;houlders. The Highland officer was capt. Macdonald, of col. Frazier's battalion; who under&s;tand|ing that a young gentleman, his kin&s;man, had dropped on the field of battle, put him|&s;elf at the head of his party, with which he penetrated to the middle of the field, drove a con&s;iderable number of French and Indians before him, and finding his relation &s;till un&s;calped, carried him off in triumph. Poer capt. Ochterlony was conveyed to Quebec, where in a few days he died of his wounds; and after the reduction of that place, the French &s;urgeons who attended him declared, that, in all probabillity, he would have recovered of the two &s;hots he had received in his brea&s;t, had not he been mortally wounded in the belly by the Indian's &s;calping knife.</P>
<P>As this very remarkable &s;cene was acted in &s;ight of both armies, General T$$nd, in the &s;equel, expo&s;tulated with the French officers upon the inhumanity of keeping up &s;uch a &s;evere fire again&s;t two wounded gentlemen, who were di&s;abled and de&s;titute of all hope of e&s;caping. They an&s;wered, that the fire was not made by the regulars, but by the Canadians and Savages, whom it was not in the power of di&s;cipline to re&s;train.</P></NOTE>

This unhappy accident occa&s;ioned a new delay, and the day was already far advanced. The wind be|gan to blow with uncommon violence, and the tide to make; &s;o that, in ca&s;e of a &s;econd repul&s;e, the retreat of brigadier Town&s;hend might have been rendered hazardous and uncertain: Mr. Wolfe therefore thought proper to de&s;i&s;t, and returned without further mole&s;tation to the other &s;ide of the river Montmorenci. The admiral ordered the two ve&s;&s;els which were a ground, to be &s;et on fire, that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy. The advantages that favoured an attack in this part con&s;i&s;ted of the following particulars. All the artillery could be u&s;ed with good effect; all the troops could act at once; and, in ca&s;e of a mi&s;|carriage, the retreat was &s;ecure and open, at lea&s;t, for a certain time of the tide. The&s;e, however, &s;eemed to be over-ballanced by other con&s;iderations. The enemy were po&s;ted on a commanding emi|nence; the beach was covered with deep mud, &s;lip|pery, and broken into holes and gullies: the hill was &s;teep, and in &s;ome places impracticable; the enemy

Had the attack &s;ucceeded the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h mu&s;t have been very heavy, and that of the French incon&s;iderable; becau&s;e the neighbouring woods afforded them immediate &s;helter: finally, the river St. Charles &s;till remained to be pa&s;&s;ed, before the town could be inve&s;ted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brigadier Murray is detached up the river.</NOTE> Immediately after this mortifying check, in which above five hundred men, and many brave officers were lo&s;t, the general detached brigadier Murray, with twelve hundred men, in tran&s;ports above the town, to co-operate with rear-admiral Holmes, whom the admiral had &s;ent up with &s;ome force again&s;t the French &s;hipping, which he hoped to de|&s;troy.

The enemy's &s;hips being &s;ecured in &s;uch a manner, as not to be approached, and nothing el&s;e occuring that required the brigadier's longer &s;tay, he returned to the camp, with intelligence obtained from his pri&s;oners, that the fort of Niagara was taken, Crown Point abandoned, and general Amher&s;t em|ployed in making preparations to attack the corps commanded at the I&s;le aux Noix by Mr. Burle|maque.</P>

This mea&s;ure how|ever, was not adopted, until the general and ad|miral had reconnoitred the town of Quebec, with a view to a general a&s;&s;ault, and concluded from their own ob&s;ervation, reinforced by the opinion of the chief engineer, who was perfectly well acquainted with the interiors of the place, that &s;uch an attack could not be hazarded with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;hips of war, indeed, might have &s;ilenced the batteries of the lower town; but, they could not affect the upper-works, from which they mu&s;t have &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the &s;ituation of this place, and the fortifications with which it was &s;ecured; the natural &s;trength of the country; the great number of ve&s;&s;els and floating batteries they had provided for the defence of the river; the &s;kill, valour, &s;uperior force, and uncommon vigilance of the enemy; their numerous bodies of &s;avages con|tinually hovering about the po&s;ts of the Engli&s;h, to &s;urprize parties and harra&s;s detachments; we mu&s;t own that there was &s;uch a combination of dif|ficulties, as might have di&s;couraged and perplexed the mo&s;t re&s;olute and intelligent commander.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the re&s;olution taken to quit the camp at Montmorenci, the troops and artillery were reimbarked and landed at Point Levi: they afterwards pa&s;&s;ed up the river in tran&s;ports, while admiral Holmes made a movement with his &s;hips to amu&s;e the enemy po&s;ted on the north-&s;hor$

As no po&s;&s;i|bility appeared of annoying the enemy above the town, the &s;cheme of operations was totally changed. The three brigadiers formed, and pre&s;ented a plan for conveying the troops farther down in boats, and landing them in the night within a league of cape-Diamond, in hope of a&s;cending the heights of Abraham, which ri&s;e abruptly, with a &s;teep a&s;cent from the banks of the river, that they might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground on the back of the city, where it was but indifferently fortified. The dangers and difficulties attending the execution of this de&s;ign were &s;o peculiarly di&s;couraging, that one would imagine it could not have been embra|ced but by a &s;pirit of enterprize that bordered on de&s;paration. The &s;tream was rapid; the &s;hore &s;$elving; the bank of the river lined with centi|ne$s; the landing place &s;o narrow as to be ea&s;ily mi&s;&s;ed in the dark; and the ground &s;o difficult as hardly to be &s;urmounted in the day-time, had no oppo&s;ition been expected. If the enemy had re|ceived the lea&s;t intimation from &s;py or de&s;erter, or even &s;u$pe$ted the &s;cheme: had the embarka|tion been di&s;ordered, in con&s;equence of the dark|ne&s;s of the night, the rapidity of the river, or the &s;helvine&s;s of the north&punc;&s;hore, near which they were obliged to row: had one centinel been alarmed; or the landing place much mi&s;taken; the heights of Abraham mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly &s;ecured, by &s;uch a force as would have rendered the undertak|ing ab$rtive: confu&s;ion would have nece&s;&s;arily en|&s;ued in the dark; and this would have naturally

produced a pannic, which might have proved fatal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to the greater part of the detachment. The&s;e ob|jections could not e&s;cape the penetration of the gal|lant Wolfe, who, neverthele&s;s, adopted the plan without he&s;itation; and even executed it in per|&s;on; tho' at that time labouring under a &s;evere dy&s;entery and fever, which had exhau&s;ted his con|&s;titution, and reduced him almo&s;t to an extremity of weakne&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops land at the heights of Abra|ham.</NOTE> The previous &s;teps being taken, and the time fixed for this hazardous attempt, admiral Holmes moved with his &s;quadron farther up the river, about three leagues above the place appointed for the di&s;embarkation; that he might deceive the enemy, and amu&s;e Mr. de Bougainville, whom Montcalm had detached with fifteen hundred men to watch the motions of that &s;qua|dron; but the Engli&s;h admiral was directed to &s;ail down the river in the night, &s;o as to protect the landing of the forces; and the&s;e orders he punctu|ally fulfilled. On the twelfth day of September, an hour after midnight, the fir&s;t embarkation, con|&s;i&s;ting of four complete regiments, the light in|fantry, commanded by colonel How, a detach|ment of Highlanders, and the American grenadiers, was made in flat-bottomed boats, under the immediate command of the brigadiers Monckton and Murray; though general Wolfe accompanied them in per&s;on, and was among the fir&s;t who land|ed, and they began to fall down with the tide, to the intended place of di&s;embarkation; rowing clo&s;e to the north &s;hore, in order to find it the more ea|&s;ily.

They told him, that the garri&s;on of Quebec expected that night to receive a convoy of provi&s;ions, &s;ent down the river in boats, from the detachment above, com|manded by Mr. de Bougain|ville. The&s;e de&s;erters &s;tand|ing upon deck, and perceiv|ing the Engli&s;h boats, with the troops, gliding down the river in the dark, began to &s;hout, and make a noi&s;e; de|claring they were part of the expected convoy. Captain Smith, who was ignorant of general Wolfe's de&s;ign, be|lieving their affirmation, had actually given orders to point the guns at the Briti&s;h troops; when the general perceiving a commo$$on on board, rowed along &s;ide in per&s;on, and pre|vented the di&s;charge, which would have alarmed the town, and entirely fru&s;trated the attempt.</P>
<P>The French had po&s;ted $span$ to chal|lenge boats and ve&s;&s;els, and give the alarm occa&s;ionally. The fir&s;t boat that contained the Engli&s;h troops, being que&s;tioned accordingly, a captain of Fra&s;er's regiment, who had &s;erved in Holland, and who was perfectly well acquainted with the French language and cu&s;toms, an|&s;wered, without he&s;itation to <HI>Qui vit,</HI> which is their chal|lenging word, <HI>la France:</HI> nor was he at a lo&s;s, to an&s;wer the &s;econd que&s;tion, which was much more particular and difficult. When the &s;entinel demanded <HI>a quel regiment?</HI> to what regiment? the captain replied <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which he knew, by accident, to be one of tho&s;e that compo&s;ed the body commanded by Bou|gainville. The &s;oldier took it for granted, this was the expected convoy; and &s;aying <HI>pa&s;&s;e,</HI> allowed all the boats to proceed without further que&s;tion. In the &s;ame man|ner, the other &s;entries were deceived; tho' one more wa|ry than the re&s;t, came run|ning down to the water's edge; and called, <HI>pourquoy e&s;t que vous ne parlez plus baut?</HI> <Q>&startq;Why don't you &s;peak with an audible voice&punc;&endq;</Q> To this interrogation, which im|plied doubt, the captain an|&s;wered with admirable pre|&s;ence of mind, in a &s;oft tone of voice, <HI>Tai toi, nous &s;erons entendues!</HI> <Q>&startq;Hu&s;h! we &s;hall be overheard and di&s;co|vered.&endq;</Q> Thus cautioned, the &s;entry retired without farther altercation. The mid&s;hipman who piloted the fir&s;t boat, pa&s;&s;ing by the landing-place in the dark, the &s;ame captain, who knew from his having been po&s;t|ed formerly with his com|pany on the other &s;ide of the river, in&s;i&s;ted upon the pi|lot's being mi&s;taken, and commanded the rowers to put a&s;hore in the proper place, or at lea&s;t very near it.</P>

Then they mounted, without further mole&s;tation from the enemy, and the general drew them up in order, as they arrived. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the Engli&s;h had gained the heights of Abra|ham, which in a manner commanded the town on its weake&s;t part, than he re&s;olved to hazard a bat|tle, and began his march without delay; after hav|ing

<P>General Wolfe, perceiving the enemy cro&s;&s;ing the river St. Charles, began to form his own line, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix battalions, and the Loui&s;|bourg grenadiers; the right commanded by bri|gadier Monckton, and the left by brigadier Mur|ray: to the rear of the left colonel Howe was po&s;ted with his light infantry, ju&s;t returned from a four gun battery, which they had taken without oppo&s;ition. Mr. de Montcalm, advancing in &s;uch a manner as to &s;hew his intention was to flank the left of the Engli&s;h, brigadier Town&s;hend was &s;ent thither with the regiment of Amher&s;t, which he formed <HI>en potence,</HI> pre&s;enting a double front to the enemy: he was afterwards reinforced by two bat|talions; and the re&s;erve con&s;i&s;ted of one regiment drawn up in eight &s;ubdivi&s;ions, with large intervals. The right of the enemy was compo&s;ed of half the colony troops, two battalions, and a body of Ca|nadians and &s;avages; their centre con&s;i&s;ted of a column, formed by two other regular battalions; and on the left, one battalion, with the remainder of the colony troops, was po&s;ted: the bu&s;hes and corn-fields in their front were lined with fifteen hundred of their be&s;t mark&s;men, who kept up an irregular galling fire, which proved fatal to many brave officers, thus &s;ingled out for de&s;truction. This fire, indeed, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure checked by the advanced po&s;ts of the Briti&s;h line; who pi|queered with the enemy for &s;ome hours before the battle began. Both armies were de&s;titute of ar|tillery, except two &s;mall pieces on the &s;ide of the French, and a &s;ingle gun, which the Engli&s;h &s;ea|m$n
<PB N="189" REF="2090">
had made &s;hift to draw up from the landing|place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> This was very well &s;erved, and galled their column &s;everely. At length, about nine in the morning, the enemy advanced to the charge, with great order and vivacity, though their fire was ir|regular and ineffectual. On the contrary, the Bri|ti&s;h forces re&s;erved their &s;hot, until the French had approached within forty yards of their line: then they poured in a terrible di&s;charge, and continued the fire with &s;uch deliberation and &s;pirit, as could not fail to produce a very con&s;iderable effect. Ge|neral Wolfe was &s;tationed on the right, at the head of Bragg's regiment, and the Loui&s;bourg grena|diers, where the attack was mo&s;t warm. As he &s;tood con&s;picuous in the front of the line, he had been aimed at by the enemy's mark&s;men; and re|reived a &s;hot in the wri&s;t, which however, did not oblige him to quit the field. Having wrapped a handkerchief round his hand, he continued giving orders without the lea&s;t emotion; and advanced at the head of the grenadiers, with their bayonets fixed, when another ball unfortunately pierced the brea&s;t of this young hero <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When the fatal ball took place, general Wolfe, find|ing him&s;elf unable to &s;tand, leaned upon the &s;houlder of a lie$t$nant, who fat down for that purpo&s;e.

While the right pre&s;&s;ed on with their bayonets, brigadier Murray bri&s;kly advanced with the troops under his command, and &s;oon broke the centre of the enemy; then the High|landers drawing their broad &s;words, fell in among them with irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity, and drove them with great &s;laughter into the town, and the works they had rai&s;ed at the bridge of the river St. Charles. On the left and rear of the Engli&s;h, the action was not &s;o violent. Some of the light infantry had thrown them&s;elves into hou&s;es, where, being attacked, they defended them&s;elves with great cou|rage and re&s;olution. Colonel Howe having taken po&s;t with two companies behind a &s;mall cop&s;e, &s;al|lied out frequently on the flanks of the enemy, during this attack, and often drove them into heaps; while brigadier Town&s;hend advanced platoons again&s;t their front: &s;o that the right wing of the French were totally prevented from executing their fir&s;t intention. The brigadier him&s;elf re|mained with Amher&s;t's regiment, to &s;upport this di&s;po&s;ition, and to over-awe a body of &s;avages, po&s;ted oppo&s;ite to the light infantry; waiting for an opportunity to fall upon the rear of the Briti&s;h army. General Wolfe being &s;lain, and, at the &s;ame time, Mr. Moncton dangerou&s;ly wounded at the head of La&s;celles's regiment, where he di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf with remarkable gallantry, the command devolved to brigadier Town&s;hend, who ha&s;tened to the centre; and finding the troops di&s;ordered in the pur&s;uit, formed them again with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. This nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k was &s;carce performed, when M. de Bougainville, with a body of two thou&s;and fre&s;h men, appeared in the
<PB N="191" REF="2110">
rear of the Engli&s;h. He had begun his march<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> from cape Rouge, as &s;oon as he received intelli|gence that the Briti&s;h troops had gained the heights of Abraham; but did not come up in time to have any &s;hare in the battle.</P>
<P>Mr. Town&s;$end immediately ordered two batta|lions, with two pieces of artillery, to advance a|gain&s;t this officer, who retired, at their reproach, among woods and &s;wamps; where general Town|&s;hend very wi&s;ely declined hazarding a precarious attack. He had already obtained a complete vic|tory; taken a great number of French officers; and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very advantageous &s;ituation, which it would have been imprudent to forego. The French general Mr. de Montcalm was mor|tally wounded in the battle, and conveyed into Quebec, from whence, before he died, he wrote a letter to general Town&s;hend, recommending the pri&s;oners to that generous humanity by which the Briti&s;h nation is di&s;tingui&s;hed. His &s;econd in command was left wounded on the field, and next day expired on board an Engli&s;h &s;hip, to which he had been conveyed. About one thou&s;and of the enemy were made pri&s;oners, including a great number of officers; and about five hundred were &s;lain on the field of battle. The wreck of their army, after they had reinforced the garri&s;on of Quebec, retired to Point au Tremble, from whence they proceeded to Jaques Quartiers, where they remained intrenched, until they were compelled by the &s;everity of the weather to make the be&s;t of their way to Trois Rivieres and Montreal.</P>
<P>This important victory was obtained at the ex|pence of fifty men killed, including nine officers;

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and of about five hundred men wounded; but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eulogium on gene|ral Wolfe.</NOTE> death of general Wolfe was a national lo&s;s, univer|&s;ally lamented. He inherited from nature, an ani|mating fervour of &s;entiment, an intuitive percep|tion, an exten&s;ive capacity, and a pa&s;&s;ion for glory, which &s;timulated him to acquire every &s;pecies of military knowledge that &s;tudy could comprehend; that actual &s;ervice could illu&s;trate and confirm. This noble warmth of di&s;po&s;itien &s;eldom fails to call forth and unfold the liberal virtues of the &s;oul. Brave above all e&s;timation of danger, he was al&s;o generous, gentle, complacent, and humane; the pattern of the officer, the darling of the &s;oldier; there was a &s;ublimity in his genius, which &s;oared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his faculties been exerci&s;ed to their full extent by op|portunity and action; had his judgment been fully matured by age and experience, he would, without doubt, have rivalled in reputation the mo&s;t celebrated captains of antiquity.</P>

What rendered the capitulation &s;till more fortunate for the Briti&s;h general, was the in|formation he afterwards received from de&s;erters, importing, that the enemy had rallied, and were reinforced behind cape Rouge, under the command of Mr. de Levy, arrived from Montreal for that purpo&s;e, with two regular battalions; and that Mr. de Bougainville, at the head of eight hundred men, with a convoy of provi&s;ions, was actually on his march to throw him&s;elf into the town on the eigh|teenth, that very morning on which it was &s;urren|dered: for the place was not then completely in|ve&s;ted, as the enemy had broke their bridge of boats, and po&s;ted detachments in very &s;trong works, on the other &s;ide of the river St. Charles.</P>
<P>The capitulation was no &s;ooner ratified, than the Briti&s;h forces took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Quebec on the land &s;ide, and guards were po&s;ted in different parts of the town, to pre&s;erve order and di&s;cipline: at the &s;ame time, captain Palli&s;er, with a body of &s;eamen, entered the lower town, and took the &s;ame precau|tions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoi|cings in England.</NOTE> Immediately after the action at the falls of Mont|moren$i, general Wolfe had di&s;patched an officer to England with a detail of that di&s;a&s;ter, written with &s;uch elegance and accuracy, as would not have di&s;graced the pen of a Cae&s;ar.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">B$n$$$|lence of the pub|lic.</NOTE> The people of England were &s;o elevated by the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, which was al&s;o pro&s;perous on the continent of Europe, that far from expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of the enormous burthens which they bore; they, with a &s;pirit pecu|liar to the Briti&s;h nation, voluntarily rai&s;ed large contributions, to purcha&s;e warm jackets, &s;tockings, &s;hoes, coats and blankets, for the &s;oldiers, who were expo&s;ed in the rigours of an inclement &s;ky, in Ger|many and America. But they di&s;played a more no|ble proof of unre&s;trained benevolence, extended even to foes. The French mini&s;try, &s;traitened in their finances, which were found &s;carce &s;ufficient to maintain the war, had &s;acrificed their duty to their king and every &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion for his un|happy &s;ubjects, to a thir&s;t of vengeance, and &s;an|guinary views of ambition. They had withdrawn the u&s;ual allowance from their &s;ubjects, who were detained pri&s;oners in England; and tho&s;e wretched creatures, amounting in number to near twenty thou&s;and, were left to the mercy of tho&s;e enemies whom their &s;overeign had taken &s;uch pains to ex|a&s;perate. The allowance with which they were in|dulged by the Briti&s;h government effectually &s;e|cured them from the horrors of famine: but &s;till they remained de&s;titute of other conveniences, and particularly expo&s;ed to the mi&s;eries of cold and na|kedne&s;s.

A con&s;ider|able &s;ub&s;cription was rai&s;ed in their behalf; and in a few weeks they were completely cloathed by the charity of their Briti&s;h benefactors. This benefit $word$ exertion was certainly one of the noble&s;t triumphs of the human mind, which even the mo&s;t inv$t$|rate enemies of Great Britain cannot but regard with reverence and admiration.</P>
<P>The city of Quebec being reduced, together with great part of the circumjacent country, bri|gadier Towmhend, who had accepted his commi&s;|&s;ion with the expre&s;s provi&s;o, that he &s;hould return to England at the end of the campaign, left a gar|ri&s;on of five thou&s;and effective men, victualled from the fleet, under the command of brigadier Murray; and embarking with admiral Saunders, arrived in Great Britain about the beginning of winter. As for brigadier Monckton, he was con|veyed to New York, where he happily recovered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Si$g$ of M$cr$&s;, in the $span$</NOTE> of his wound.</P>
<P>While the arms of Great Britain triumphed in Europe and America, her intere&s;t was not &s;uffered to langui&s;h in other parts of the world.

The Ea&s;t Indies, which, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, had been the theatre of operations carried on with va|rious &s;ucce&s;s, exhibited nothing now but a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of trophies to the Engli&s;h commanders. The
<PB N="201" REF="2220">
Indian tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year, we interrupted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> at that period, when the French general Lally was employed in making preparations for the &s;iege of Madra&s;s. In the month of October he had marched into Arcot without oppo&s;ition; and, in the begin|ning of December, he advanced towards Madra&s;. On the twelfth he marched over Choultry plain, in three divi&s;ions, can$onaded by the Engli&s;h artil|lery with con&s;iderable effect, and took po&s;t at Eg|more and St. Thome. Colonel Laurence, who commanded the garri&s;on of Madra&s;s, retired to the i&s;land, in order to prevent the enemy from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land-bridge; and at the &s;ame time ordered the po&s;ts to be occupied in the black town, or &s;uburbs of Madra&s;s. In the morning of the fourteenth, the enemy marching with their whole force to attack this place, the Engli&s;h detach|ments retreated into the garri&s;on; and within the hour a grand &s;ally was made, under the command of colonel Draper, a gallant officer, who &s;ignalized him&s;elf remarkably on this occa&s;ion. He attacked the regiment of Lorraine with great impetuo&s;ity; and, in all probability, would have cut them off, had not they been &s;u&s;tained by the arrival of a fre&s;h brigade. After a very warm di&s;pute, in which ma|ny officers, and a good number of men were killed on each &s;ide, colonel Draper was obliged to retreat, not altogethet &s;atisfied with the conduct of his gre|nadiers. As the garri&s;on of Madra&s;s was not very numerous, nothing further was attempted on their &s;ide without the works. In the mean time the enemy u&s;ed all their diligence in erecting their bat|teries again&s;t the fort and town; which being opened on the &s;ixth day of January, maintained a
<PB N="202" REF="2230">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> continued di&s;charge of &s;hot and &s;hells for twenty days, advancing their trenches all the time under cover of this fire, until they reached the brea&s;t of the glacis. There they erected a battery of four pieces of cannon, and opened it on the la&s;t day of the month; but for five days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, they were obliged to clo&s;e their embra&s;ures by the &s;u|perior fire of the fort, and at length to abandon it intirely: neverthele&s;s, they &s;till maintained a &s;evere fire from the fir&s;t grand battery, which was placed at the di&s;tance of four hundred and fifty yards from the defences. This artillery was &s;o well &s;erved, as to di&s;able twenty-&s;ix pieces of cannon, three mor|tars, and effect an incon&s;iderable breach. Perhaps they might have had more &s;ucce&s;s, had they bat|tered in breach from the beginning; but Mr. Lal|ly, in order to intimidate the inhabitants, had cruelly bombarded the town and demoli&s;hed the hou&s;es: he was, however, happily di&s;appointed in his expectation, by the wi&s;e and re&s;olute pre|cautions of governor Pigot; by the vigilance, conduct, and bravery of the colonels Laurence and Draper, &s;econded by the valour and acti|vity of major Brereton, and the &s;pirit of the inferior officers. The artillery of the garri&s;on was &s;o well managed, that, from the fifth day of February, the fire of the enemy gradually de|crea&s;ed from twenty-three to &s;ix pieces of can|non: neverthele&s;s, they advanced their &s;ap along the &s;ea &s;ide, &s;o as to embrace intirely the north ea&s;t angle of the covered way, from whence their mu&s;|qu$try drove the be&s;ieged. They likewi&s;e endea|voured to open a pa&s;&s;age into the ditch by a mine; but &s;prung it &s;o injudiciou&s;ly, that they could make
<PB N="203" REF="2240">
no advantage of it, as it lay expo&s;ed to the fire of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> &s;everal cannon. While the&s;e operations were car|ried on before the town, major Caillaud with a body of &s;ipoys, &s;ome of the country hor&s;e, and a few Europeans, drawn from the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons of Trichenapally and Chingliput, hovered at the di&s;tance of a few miles; blocking up the roads in &s;uch a manner, that the enemy were obliged, four &s;everal times, to &s;end large detachments again&s;t him, in order to open the communication: thus the progre&s;s of the &s;iege was in a great mea&s;ure re|tarded. On the &s;ixteenth day of February in the evening, the Queenborough &s;hip of war, com|manded by captain Kempen&s;elt, and the company's &s;hip the Revenge, arrived in the road of Madra&s;s, with a reinforcement of &s;ix hundred men, be|longing to colonel Draper's regiment: and part of them was immediately di&s;embarked. From the beginning of the &s;iege, the enemy had di&s;co|vered a backwardne&s;s in the &s;ervice, very un&s;uit|able to their national character. They were ill &s;up|plied by their commi&s;&s;aries and contractors: they were di&s;couraged by the ob&s;tinate defence of the garri&s;on; and all their hope of &s;ucce&s;s vani&s;hed at the arrival of this reinforcement. After a bri&s;k fire, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege that very night, aban|doning forty pieces of cannon; and, having de&s;troyed the powder-mills at Ogmore, retreated to the ter|ritory of Arcot <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The chagrin and mor|tification of Lally, are &s;trong|ly marked in the following intercepted letter to Mr. de Legret, dated from the camp before Madra&s;s.</P>

The Bri&s;tol&punc; on the other hand, did out ju&s;t make her appearance before St. Thomas&punc; and on the vague report of 1$ &s;hips coming from Porto Novo, &s;he took fright; and after landing the provi&s;ions with which &s;he was laden, &s;he would not &s;tay long enough, even to take on board 12 of her own guns, which &s;he had lent us for the &s;iege.</P>
<P>If I was the judge of the point of honour of the com|pany&punc;s officers, I would break him like gla&s;s, as well as &s;ome others of them.</P>
<P>The Fidelle, or the Har|lem, or even the afore&s;aid Bri&s;tol, with her 12 guns re|&s;tored to her, would be &s;uffi|cient to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Engli&s;h &s;hip, if they could manage &s;o as to get to windward of her in the night.

<P>I reckon we &s;hall, at our arrival at Pondicherry, en|deavour to learn &s;ome other trade; for this of war re|quires too much patience.</P>
<P>Of 1500 Cipayes which at|tended our army, I reckon near 800 are employed upon the road of Pondicherry, la|den with &s;ugar, pepper, and other goods; and as for the Coulis, they are all employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, from the fir&s;t day we came here.</P>

On the fourteenth day of the month, he began his march from Conjiveram for Wandewa&s;h, at the head of four hundred Euro|peans, &s;even thou&s;and &s;ipoys, &s;eventy European, and three hundred black hor&s;e, with fourteen pieces of artillery. In his march he inve&s;ted and took the fort of Trivitar, from whence he proceeded to the village of Wandewa&s;h, where the French, to the number of one thou&s;and, were &s;trongly encamped under the guns of a fort commanded by a raja, mounting twenty cannon, under the direction of a French gunner. On the thirtieth day of Septem|ber, the Engli&s;h at two in the morning attacked the village in three different places, and drove them from it, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute; but this advantage they were not able to maintain. The black pioneers ran away during the attack; &s;o that proper traver&s;es could not be made in the &s;treets; and at day-break the fort poured in upon them a prodigious di&s;charge of grape-&s;hot, with a con&s;iderable effect. The enemy had retired to a dry ditch, which &s;erved as an intrenchment, from whence they made furious &s;allies; and a body of three hundred European hor&s;e were already in mo|tion, to fall upon and complete their confu&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vice ad|miral Po|cock $h|tains a th$$d ad+vantage over the French &s;quadron com|manded by M.

On the fir&s;t day of September, vice-admiral Pococke &s;ailed from Madra&s;s to the &s;outhward, inque&s;t of the enemy; and next day de&s;cried the French fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen &s;ail, &s;tanding to the northward. He forthwith threw out the &s;ignal for a general chace, and &s;tood towards them with all the &s;ail he could carry; but the wind abating, he could not approach near enough to en|gage. During the three &s;ucceeding days, he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to bring them to a battle, which they &s;till declined, and at la&s;t they di&s;ap|peared. He then directed his cour&s;e to Pondi|cherry, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they were bound to that harbour; and on the eighth day of the month, perceived them &s;tanding to the &s;outhward: but he could not bring them to an engagement till the tenth, when Mr. d'Apche about two in the after|noon, made the &s;ignal for battle, and the canno|nading began without further delay. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron did not exceed nine &s;hips of the line; the enemy's fleet con&s;i&s;ted of eleven; but they had &s;till a greater advantage in number of men and artil|lery. Both &s;quadrons fought with great impetuo|&s;ity,

till about ten minutes after four, when the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> enemy's rear began to give way: this example was &s;oon followed by their centre: and finally the van, with the whole &s;quadron, bore to the &s;outh&punc;&s;outh|ea&s;t, with all the canvas they could &s;pread. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron was &s;o much damaged in their ma&s;ts and rigging, that they could not pur&s;ue; &s;o that M. d' Apche retreated at his lei&s;ure unmole&s;ted. On the fifteenth, admiral Pocock returned to Ma|dra&s;s, where his &s;quadron being repaired by the twenty-&s;ixth, he &s;ailed again to Pondicherry, and in the road &s;aw the enemy lying at anchor in line of battle. The wind being off &s;hore, he made the line of battle a-head, and for &s;ome time continued in this &s;ituation. At length the French admiral weighed anchor, and came forth; but in&s;tead of bearing down upon the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, which had fallen to leeward, he kept clo&s;e to the wind, and &s;tretched away to the &s;outhward. Admiral Po|cock finding him aver&s;e to another engagement, and his own &s;quadron being in no condition to pur|&s;ue, he, with the advice of his captains, de&s;i&s;ted, and mea&s;ured back his cour&s;e to Madra&s;s. On the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, above three hundred men were killed in the engagement, including captain Michie, who commanded the Newca&s;tle, captain Gore of the marines, two lieutenants, a ma&s;ter, gunner, and boat&s;wain; the captains Somer&s;et and Brereton, with about two hundred and fifty men were wound|ed, and many of the &s;hips con&s;iderably damaged. The lo&s;s of the enemy mu&s;t have been much more con&s;iderable; becau&s;e the Engli&s;h in battle always fire at the body of the &s;hip; becau&s;e the French &s;quadron was crowded with men; becau&s;e they

Thus they left the Engli&s;h ma&s;ters of the Indian coa&s;t; a &s;uperiority &s;till more confirmed by the ar|rival of rear-admiral Corni&s;h with four &s;hips of the line, who had &s;et &s;ail from England in the begin|ning of the year, and joined admiral Pocock at Madra&s;s on the eighteenth day of October.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;tili|ties by the Dutch in the river of Bengal.</NOTE> The French were not the only enemies with whom the Engli&s;h had to cope in the Ea&s;t-Indies. The great exten&s;ion of their trade in the kingdom of Bengal, had excited the envy and avarice of the Dutch factory, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;trong fort at Chin|chura in the river of Bengal; and re&s;olved, if po&s;|&s;ible, to engro&s;s the whole &s;alt-petre branch of com|merce. They had, without doubt, tampered with the new Nabob, who lay under &s;uch obligations to the Engli&s;h, and probably &s;ecured his connivance. Their &s;cheme was approved by the governor of Ba|tavia, who charged him&s;elf with the execution of it; and, for that purpo&s;e, cho&s;e the opportunity when the Briti&s;h &s;quadron had retired to the coa&s;t of Malabar. On pretence of reinforcing the Dutch garri&s;ons in Bengal, he equipped an armament of &s;even &s;hips, having on board five hundred Euro|pean troops, and &s;ix hundred Malaye&s;e, under the command of colonel Ru&s;&s;el. This armament hav|ing touched at Negapatam, proceeded up the bay, and arrived in the river of Bengal about the begin|ning of October. Colonel Clive, who then re&s;ided at Calcutta, had received information of their de|&s;ign, which he was re&s;olved, at all events, to de|feat.
<PB N="211" REF="2330">
He complained to the Subah, who, upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> &s;uch application, could not decently refu&s;e an or|der to the director and council of Hughley, im|plying, that this armament &s;hould not proceed up the river. The colonel at the &s;ame time &s;ent a let|ter to the Dutch commodore, intimating, that as he had received information of their de&s;ign, he could not allow them to land forces, and march to Chinchura. In an&s;wer to this declaration, the Dutch commodore, who&s;e whole fleet had not yet arrived, a&s;&s;ured the Engli&s;h commander that he had no in|tention to &s;end any forces to Chinchura; and begged liberty to land &s;ome of his troops for refre&s;hment; a favour that was granted, on condition that they &s;hould not advance. Notwith&s;tanding the Subah's order, and his own engagement to this effect, the re&s;t of the &s;hips were no &s;ooner arrived, than he pro|ceeded up the river to the neighbourhood of Tan|nah-fort, where his forces being di&s;embarked, began their march to Chinchura. In the mean time, by way of retaliating the affront he pre|tended to have &s;u&s;tained, in being denied a pa&s;&s;age to their own factory, he took &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els on the river belonging to the Engli&s;h company; and the Calcutta Indiaman, commanded by cap|tain Wil&s;on, homeward-bound, &s;ailing down the river, the Dutchman gave him to under&s;tand, that if he pre&s;umed to pa&s;s, he would &s;ink him without further ceremony. The Engli&s;h captain &s;eeing them run out their guns, as if really re&s;olved to put his threats in execution, returned to Calcutta, where two other India &s;hips lay at anchor, and reported his adventure to colonel Clive, who forth|with ordered the three &s;hips to prepare for bat|tle,
<PB N="212" REF="2340">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and attack the Dutch armament. The &s;hips being properly manned, and their quarters lined with &s;alt-petre, they fell down the river, and found the Dutch &s;quadron drawn up in line of battle, in order to give them a warm reception, for which indeed they &s;eemed well prepared: for three of them were mounted with thirty-&s;ix guns each; three of them with twenty-&s;ix; and the &s;eventh carried &s;ixteen. The duke of Dorlet, commanded by captain Forre&s;ter, being the fir&s;t that approached them, dropped anchor clo&s;e to their line, and be|gan the engagement with a broad&s;ide, which was immediately returned. A dead calm unfortunately intervening&punc; this &s;ingle &s;hip was for a con&s;iderable time expo&s;ed to the whole fire of the enemy; but a &s;mall breeze &s;pringing up, the Calcutta and the Hardwick advanced to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a &s;evere fire was maintained on both &s;ides, till two of the Dutch &s;hips &s;lipping their cables, bore away, and a third was driven a&s;hore. Their commodore thus weakened, after a few broad&s;ides, &s;truck his flag to captain Wil&s;on; and the other three followed his example. The victory being thus obtained, without the lo&s;s of one man on the &s;ide of the En|gli&s;h, captain Wil&s;on took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prizes, the decks of which were &s;trewed with carnage, and &s;ent the pri&s;oners to colonel Clive at Calcutta. The detachment of troops, which they had landed to the number of eleven hundred men, was not more fortunate in their progre&s;s. Colonel Clive no &s;ooner received intelligence that they were in full march to Chinchura, than he detached colonel Forde, with five hundred men from Calcutta, in order to oppo&s;e, and put a &s;top to their march
<PB N="213" REF="2350">
at the French gardens. He accordingly advanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to the northward, and entered the town of Chan|danagore, where he &s;u&s;tained the fire of a Dutch party &s;ent out from Chinchura to join and con|duct the expected reinforcement. The&s;e being routed and di&s;per&s;ed, after a &s;hort action, colo|nel Forde in the morning proceeded to a plain in the neighbourhood of Chinchura, where he found the enemy prepared to give him battle, on the twenty-fifth day of November. They even ad|vanced to the charge with great re&s;olution and activity; but found the fire of the Engli&s;h artil|lery and battalion &s;o intoler ably hot, that they &s;oon give way, and were totally defeated. A con|&s;iderable number was killed, and the greater part of tho&s;e who &s;urvived the action, was taken pri|&s;oners. During this conte&s;t, the Nabob, at the head of a con&s;iderable army, ob&s;erved a &s;u&s;picious neutrality; and in all likelihood would have de|clared for the Dutch, had they proved victorious, as he had rea&s;on to believe they would from their great &s;uperiority in number. But fortune no &s;ooner determined in favour of the Engli&s;h, than he made a tender of his &s;ervice to the victor, and even offered to reduce Chinchura with his own army.</P>

After all, perhaps the Dutch company meant<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> nothing more than to put their factory of Chin|chura on a more re&s;pectable footing; and by ac|quiring greater weight and con&s;equence among the people of the country than they formerly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, the more ea&s;ily extend their commerce in that part of the world. At any rate, it will ad|mit of a di&s;pute among tho&s;e who profe&s;s the law of nature and nations, whether the Dutch com|pany could be ju&s;tly debarred the privilege of &s;ending a reinforcement to their own garri&s;ons. Be that as it will, the &s;hips were not re&s;tored until the factory at Chinchura had given &s;ecurity to in|demnify the Engli&s;h for the damage they had &s;u&s;|tained on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h company was &s;till more con&s;picuous on the coa&s;t of Coromandel. The governor and council of Madra&s;s having re|ceived information, that the French general Lally had &s;ent a detachment of his army to the &s;outh|ward, taken Syringham, and threatened Triche|napally with a &s;iege, it was determined that colo|nel Coote, who had lately arrived from England,
<PB N="218" REF="2400">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> &s;hould take the field and endeavour to make a di|ver&s;ion to the &s;outhward. He accordingly began his march at the head of &s;eventeen hundred Eu|ropeans, including cavalry, and three thou&s;and Blacks, with fourteen pieces of cannon and one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonel Coote re|duces the fort of Wande|$a&s;h.</NOTE> howitz. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of November he inve&s;ted the fort of Wandewa&s;h: having made a practicable breach, the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of near nine hundred men, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war; and he found in the place forty-nine pieces of cannon, with a great quantity of ammunition. Then he undertook the &s;iege of Carangoly, a for|tre&s;s commanded by colonel O'Kennely, at the head of one hundred Europeans, and five hundred &s;ipoys. In a few days he di&s;mounted the greater part of their guns; and they &s;ubmitted, on condi|tion, that the Europeans &s;hould be allowed to march out with the honours of war; but the Sipoys were di&s;armed, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives battle to general Lally&punc; who is defeated.</NOTE> General Lally, alarmed at the progre&s;s of this brave, vigilant, and enterpri&s;ing officer, a&s;&s;embled all his forces at Arcot, to the number of two thou|&s;and two hundred Europeans, including hor&s;e, three hundred Cofferies, and ten thou&s;and black troops, or &s;ipoys, with five and twenty pieces of cannon. Of the&s;e he a&s;&s;umed the command in per|&s;on; and on the tenth day of January began his march, in order to recover Wandewa&s;h. Colonel Coote, having received intelligence on the twelfth that he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Conjeveram, endea|voured by a forced march to &s;ave the place, which they accordingly abandoned at his approach, and pur&s;uing their march to Wandewa&s;h, inve&s;ted
<PB N="219" REF="2410">
the fort without delay. The Engli&s;h commander<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed the river Palla, in order to follow the &s;ame route; and, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of the month, under&s;tanding that a breach was already made, re&s;olved to give them battle without further delay. The cavalry being formed, and &s;upport|ed by five companies of Sipoys, he advanced again&s;t the enemy's hor&s;e, which, being at the &s;ame time galled by two pieces of cannon, re|tired with precipitation. Then colonel Coote, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tank which they had occupied, returned to the line, which was by this time formed in order of battle. Seeing the men in high &s;pirits, and eager to engage, he ordered the whole army to advance; and by nine in the morning they were within two miles of the enemy's camp, where they halted about half an hour. During this interval, the colonel reconnoitered the &s;ituation of the French forces, who were very ad|vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, and made a movement to the right, which obliged them to alter their di&s;po&s;ition. They now advanced, in their turn, within three quarters of a mile of the Engli&s;h line; and the cannonading began with great fury on both &s;ides. About noon their European cavalry coming up with a re&s;olute air to charge the left of the Engli&s;h, colonel Coote brought up &s;ome companies of &s;ipoys, and two pieces of cannon, to &s;u&s;tain the hor&s;e, which were ordered to oppo&s;e them; and the&s;e advancing on their flank, di&s;turbed them &s;o much that they broke, and were driven by the Engli&s;h cavalry above a mile from the left, upon the rear of their own army. Mean while, both
<PB N="220" REF="2420">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> lines continued advancing to each other; and about one o'clock the firing with &s;ma$l arms be|gan with great vivacity. One of the French tum|brils being blown up by an accidental &s;hot, the Engli&s;h commander took immediate advantage of their confu&s;ion. He ordered major Brereton to wheel Draper's regiment to the left, and fall upon the enemy's flank. This &s;ervice was performed with &s;uch re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s, that the left wing of the French was compleatly routed, and fell upon their centre, now clo&s;ely engaged with the left of the Engli&s;h. About two in the after|noon their whole line gave way, and fled towards their own camp, which, perceiving them&s;elves clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, they precipitately abandoned, toge|ther with twenty-two pieces of cannon. In this engagement they lo&s;t about eight hundred men, killed and wounded, be&s;ides about fifty pri&s;oners, including brigadier-general de Bu&s;&s;y, the chevalier Godeville, quarter-ma&s;ter-general, lieutenant&punc;colo|nel Murphy, three captains, five lieutenants, and &s;ome other officers. On the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h two hundred and &s;ixty-two were killed or wounded, and among the former the gallant and accompli&s;hed major Brereton, who&s;e death was a real lo&s;s to his country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He con|quers the province of Arcot.</NOTE> General Lally having retreated with his broken troops to Pondicherry, the baron de Va&s;&s;erot was detached towards the &s;ame place, with a thou&s;and hor&s;e and three hundred &s;ipoys, to ravage and lay wa&s;te the French territory.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the indefatigable colonel Coote undertook the &s;iege of Chilliput, which in
<PB N="221" REF="2430">
two days was &s;urrendered by the chevalier de Til|ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> him&s;elf and his garri&s;on remaining pri&s;oners of war. Such al&s;o was the &s;ate of fort Timmery, which being reduced, the colonel pro&s;ecuted his march to Arcot, the capital of the province, again&s;t the fort of which he opened his batteries on the fifth day of February. When he had carried on his approaches within &s;ixty yards of the cre&s;t of the glacis, the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and fifty Europeans, and near three hundred &s;i|poys, &s;urrendered as pri&s;oners of war; and here the Engli&s;h commander found two and twenty pieces of cannon, four mortars, and a great quan|tity of all kind of military &s;tores.</P>
<P>Thus the campaign was gloriou&s;ly fini&s;hed with the conque&s;t of Arcot, after the French army had been routed and ruined by the diligence of colonel Coote, who&s;e courage, conduct, and activity, can|not be &s;ufficiently admired.

But fir&s;t it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ketch out the &s;ituations in which the belligerant pow|ers were found at the clo&s;e of winter. The vi$$&s;|&s;itudes of fortune, with which the preceding cam|paign
<PB N="222" REF="2440">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> had been checquered, were &s;ufficient to con|vince every potentate concerned in the war, that neither &s;ide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;uperiority in &s;trength or conduct, as was requi&s;ite to impo&s;e terms upon the other. Battles had been fought with various &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;urpri&s;ing efforts of military &s;kill had been ex|hibited, without producing one event which tended to promote a general peace, or even engender the lea&s;t de&s;ire of accommodation: on the contrary, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of animo&s;ity had by this time &s;ub&s;ided into a confirmed habit of de|liberate hatred; and every contending power &s;eemed more than ever determined to protract the di&s;pute; while the neutral &s;tates kept aloof, with|out expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t de&s;ire of interpo&s;ing their mediation. Some of them were re&s;trained by con&s;i|derations of conveniency; and others waited in &s;u&s;|pence for the death of the Spani&s;h monarch, as an event which they imagined would be attended with very important con&s;equences in the &s;outhern parts of Europe. With re&s;pect to the maintenance of the war, whatever difficulties might have ari&s;en in &s;et|tling funds to &s;upport the expence, and finding men to recruit the different armies, certain it is all the&s;e difficulties were &s;urmounted before the opening of the campaign. The court of Vienna, tho' hampered by the narrowne&s;s of its finances, &s;till found re&s;ources in the fertility of its provinces, in the number and attachment of its &s;ubjects, who, more than any other people in Europe, acquie&s;ce in the di&s;po&s;itions of their &s;overeign; and, when pay cannot be afforded, willingly contribute free quarters for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army.

Sweden &s;till made a &s;hew of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch; but continued to &s;lumber over the engagements &s;he had contracted. France, exhau&s;ted in her finances, and abridged of her ma|rine commerce, maintained a re&s;olute countenance&punc; &s;upplied fre&s;h armies for her operations in We&s;t|phalia, projected new &s;chemes of conque&s;t, and ca|joled her allies with fair promi&s;es, when &s;he had nothing more &s;olid to be&s;tow. The king of Pru&s;|&s;ia's dominions were generally drained, or in the hands of the enemy; but, to ballance the&s;e di&s;ad|vantages, he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Saxony, and en|joyed his annual &s;ub&s;idy from Great Britain, which effectually enabled him to maintain his armies on a re&s;pectable footing, and open the campaign with equal eagerne&s;s and confidence.</P>

On the &s;econd day of January, the French regiment of Na&s;&s;au pre&s;enting it&s;elf before the gate of Frankfort on the Mayne, a neutral im|perial city, and demanding a pa&s;&s;age, it was in|troduced, and conducted by a detachment of the garri&s;on, through the city as far as the gate of Saxen&punc;hau&s;en, where it unexpectedly halted, and immediately di&s;armed the guards. Be|fore the inhabitants could recover from the con|&s;ternation into which they were thrown by this out|rageous in&s;ult, five other French regiments en|tered the place, and here their general the prince de Soubi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters. How deeply &s;oever this violation of the laws of the Em|pire might be re&s;ented by all hone&s;t Germans, who retained affection for the con&s;titutions of their country; it was a &s;tep from which the French ar|my derived a very manife&s;t and important advan|tage; for it &s;ecured to them the cour&s;e of the Maine and the Upper Rhine; by which they re|ceived, without difficulty or danger, every &s;pecies of &s;upply, from Mentz, Spire, Worms, and even the country of Al&s;ace; while it maintained their communication with the chain formed by the Au&s;|trian forces and the army of the Empire.</P>

In a few days, however, they them&s;elves retreated again with great precipitation, though they did not all e&s;cape. The hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, with a body of Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, fell upon them &s;uddenly at Molrich&s;tadt, where he routed and di&s;per&s;ed a regiment of Hohenzollern cuira&s;&s;iers, and a battalion of the troops of Wurtz|burg. He next day, which was the fir&s;t of April, advanced with a body of hor&s;e and foot to Mei|nungen, where he found a con&s;iderable magazine, took two battalions pri&s;oners, and &s;urpri&s;ed a third po&s;ted at Wafungen, after having defeated &s;ome Au&s;trian troops that were on the march to its re|lief.

On the thir|teenth he came in &s;ight of the enemy, whom he found &s;trongly encamped about the village of Ber|gen, between Frankfort and Hanau. Their ge|neral,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the duke de Broglio, counted one of the be&s;t officers in France, with re&s;pect to conduct and intrepidity, having received intelligence of the prince's de&s;ign, occupied this po&s;t on the twelfth, the right of his army being at Bergen, and his centre and flanks &s;ecured in &s;uch a manner, that the allies could not make their attack any other way but by the village. Notwith&s;tanding the ad|vantage of their &s;ituation, prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to give them battle, and made his di&s;po&s;itions ac|cordingly. About ten in the morning the grena|diers of the advanced guard began the attack on the village of Bergen with great vivacity, and &s;u&s;|tained a mo&s;t terrible fire from eight German bat|talions, &s;upported by &s;everal brigades of French in&s;antry. The grenadiers of the allied army, though &s;upported by &s;everal battalions under the command of the prince of Y&s;embourg, far from di&s;lodging the enemy from the village, were, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, obliged to retreat in &s;ome di&s;order; but rallied again behind a body of He&s;|&s;ian cavalry. The allies being repul&s;ed in three different attacks, their general made a new di&s;po|&s;ition, and brought up his artillery, with which the village and different parts of the French line were &s;everely cannonaded. They were not &s;low in retorting an equal fire, which continued till night, when the allies retreated to Windeken, with the lo&s;s of five pieces of cannon, and about two thou|&s;and men, including the prince of Y&s;embourg, who fell in the action.</P>
<P>The French, by the nature of their &s;ituation, could not &s;uffer much; but they were &s;o effectually amu&s;ed by the artful di&s;po&s;ition of prince Ferdi|nand,

that, in&s;tead of taking mea&s;ures to harra&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> him in his retreat, they carefully maintained their &s;ituation, apprehen&s;ive of another general attack. Indeed, they had great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of this battle, without ri&s;quing, in any mea&s;ure, the advantage which they had gained.

<P>On the other hand, the allies, in con&s;equence of their mi&s;carriage, were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of acting upon the defen&s;ive, and encountering a great number of difficulties and inconveniencies, during great part of the campaign, until the mi&s;|conduct of the enemy turned the &s;cale in their favour. In the mean time, the prince thought proper to begin his retreat in the night towards Fulda, in which his rear &s;uffered con&s;iderably from a body of the enemy's light troops under the command of M. de Blai&s;el, who &s;urpri&s;ed two &s;quadrons of dra|goons, and a battalion of grenadiers.

The&s;e pre|cautions, however, &s;eemed to produce little effect in his favour.

Fifteen batta|lions and nineteen &s;quadrons, with a brigade of heavy artillery, were left under the command of general Wangenheim on the left, behind the vil|lage of Dodenhau&s;en, which was fortified with &s;ome redoubts, defended by two battalions. Colonel Luckner, with the Hanoverian hu&s;&s;ars and a bri|gade of hunters, &s;u&s;tained by two battalions of grenadiers, was po&s;ted between Buckebourg and the We&s;er, to ob&s;erve the body of troops com|manded by the duke of Broglio on the other &s;ide of the river.</P>

At three in the morning the enemy began to cannonade the prince's quar|ters at Hille from a battery of &s;ix cannon, which they had rai&s;ed in the preceding evening on the

The prince of Anhalt, lieutenant-general for the day, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with the re&s;t of the piquets of the village of Halen, where prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to &s;upport his right. It was al|ready in the hands of the enemy; but they &s;oon abandoned it with precipitation. The allied army, being put in motion, advanced in eight columns, and occupied the ground between Halen and Hem|mern, while general Wangenheim's corps filled up the &s;pace between this la&s;t village and Doden|hau&s;en. The enemy made their principal effort on the left, intending to force the infantry of Wan|genheim's corps, and penetrate between it and the body of the allied army. For this purpo&s;e the duke de Broglio attacked them with great fury; but was &s;everely checked by a battery of thirty cannon, prepared for his reception by the count de Buckebourg, grand ma&s;ter of the artillery, and &s;erved with admirable effect, under his own eye and direction. About five in the morning, both armies cannonaded each other: at &s;ix the fire of mu&s;quetry began with great vivacity, and the action became very hot towards the right, where &s;ix regiments of Engli&s;h infantry, and two batta|lions of Hanoverian guards, not only bore the whole brunt of the French carabineers and gen|darmerie,

While both ar|mies remained in this po&s;ition, the duke de Brog|lio received the &s;taff as marechal of France, and made an attempt to beat up the quarters of the allies. Having called in all his detachments, he marched up to them on the twenty-fifth day of December; but found them &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to give him a warm reception, that he thought pro|per to lay a&s;ide his de&s;ign, and nothing but a mu|tual cannonade en&s;ued: then he returned to his former quarters. From Kleinlinnes the allied ar|my removed to Cor&s;dorf, where they were can|toned till the beginning of January, when they fell back as far as Marpurg, where prince Ferdinand e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters. The enemy had by this time retrieved their &s;uperiority, in con&s;equence of the hereditary prince's being detached with fif|teen thou&s;and men to join the king of Pru&s;&s;ia at

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Pru&s;&s;ia takes the command of We|del's corps.</NOTE> By this time, the armies of count Daun, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, had made &s;everal motions.

The Au&s;trian general was obliged to retreat with lo&s;s; while the king penetrated into Sile&s;ia, that he might be at hand to act again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, who&s;e pro|gre&s;s was now become the chief object of his ap|prehen&s;ion.

Thus reinforced, the number of the king's army at Muhlro&s;e did not exceed fifty thou&s;and, whereas the Ru&s;&s;ians were more numerous by thirty thou&s;and. They had cho&s;en a &s;trong camp at the village of Cuner&s;dorf, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Frankfort upon the Oder, and encrea&s;ed the natural &s;trength of their &s;ituation by intrenchments mounted with a numerous artillery. In other circum&s;tances, it might have been deemed a ra&s;h and ridiculous en|terprize, to attack &s;uch an army under &s;uch com|plicated di&s;advantages: but here was no room for he&s;itation.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> that covered the village of Cuner&s;dorf were taken by a&s;&s;ault, one after another. One half of the ta&s;k was not yet performed: the Ru&s;&s;ians made a firm &s;tand at the village; but they were over|borne by the impetuo&s;ity of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who drove them from po&s;t to po&s;t up to the la&s;t re|doubts they had to defend. As the Ru&s;&s;ians kept their ground until they were hewn down in their ranks, this &s;ucce&s;s was not acquired without infi|nite labour, and a con&s;iderable expence of blood. After a furious conte&s;t of &s;ix hours, fortune &s;eemed to declare &s;o much in favour of the Pru&s;&s;ians, that the king di&s;patched the following billet to the queen at Berlin: "Madam, we have driven the Ru&s;&s;ians from their intrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory." This intimation was premature, and &s;ubjected the writer to the ridicule of his enemies. The Ru&s;&s;ians were &s;taggered, not routed. General Soltikoff rallied his troops, and re|inforced his left wing under cover of a redoubt, which was erected on an eminence called the Jews Burying-ground, and here they &s;tood in order of battle, with the mo&s;t re&s;olute countenance; fa|voured by the &s;ituation, which was naturally diffi|cult of acce&s;s, and now rendered almo&s;t impreg|nable by the fortification, and a numerous artillery, &s;till greatly &s;uperior to that of the Pru&s;&s;ians. Had the king contented him&s;elf with the advantage already gained, all the world would have acknowledged he had fought again&s;t terrible odds with a&s;toni&s;hing prowe&s;s; and that he judiciou&s;ly de&s;i&s;ted, when he could no longer per&s;evere without incurring the imputation of being actuated by frenzy or de&s;pair.
<PB N="253" REF="2760">
His troops had not only &s;uffered &s;everely from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> enemy's fire, which was clo&s;e, deliberate, and well directed, but they were fatigued by the hard &s;ervice, and fainting with the heat of the day, which was ex|ce&s;&s;ive. His general officers are &s;aid to have re|minded him of all the&s;e circum&s;tances; and to have di&s;&s;uaded him from hazarding an attempt attended with &s;uch danger and difficulty, as even an army of fre&s;h troops could hardly hope to &s;urmount. He rejected this &s;alutary advice, and ordered his infantry to begin a new attack, which being an enterpri&s;e beyond their &s;trength, they were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. Being afterwards rallied, they returned to the charge: they mi&s;carried again, and their lo&s;s was redoubled. Being thus rendered unfit for further &s;ervice, the cavalry &s;ucceeded to the attack, and repeated their un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts, until they were almo&s;t broke and entirely exhau&s;ted. At this critical juncture, the whole body of the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian cavalry, which had hitherto remained inactive, and were therefore fre&s;h and in &s;pirits, fell in among the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e with great fury, broke that line at the fir&s;t charge, and forcing them back upon the infantry, threw them into &s;uch di&s;order as could not be repaired. The Pru&s;&s;ian army being thus involved in confu&s;ion, was &s;eized with a pannic, and in a few minutes totally de|feated and di&s;per&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the per&s;onal efforts of the king, who hazarded his life in the hotte&s;t parts of the battle, led on his troops three times to the charge, while two hor&s;es were killed under him, and his cloaths, in &s;everal parts, penetrated with mu&s;quet&punc;balls. His army being

When he abandoned the field of battle, he di&s;patched another billet to the queen, couched in the&s;e terms: "Remove from Berlin with the royal family. Let the archives be carried to Pot&s;dam. The town may make conditions with the enemy." The horror and confu&s;ion which this intimation produced at Berlin may be ea&s;ily conceived: hor|ror the more aggravated, as it &s;eized them in the mid&s;t of their rejoicing occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t di&s;|patch; and this was &s;till more dreadfully aug|mented, by a &s;ub&s;equent indi&s;tinct relation, import|ing, that the army was totally routed, the king mi&s;&s;ing, and the enemy in full march to Berlin. The battle of Cuner&s;dorf was by far by the mo&s;t bloody action that had happened &s;ince the com|mencement of ho&s;tilities. The carriage was truly horrible: above twenty thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians lay dead on the field, and among the&s;e general Put|kammer. The generals Seidlitz, Itzenplitz, Hul|&s;en, Finck, and Wedel, the prince of Wurtem|berg, and five major-generals, were wounded. The lo&s;s of the enemy amounted to ten thou&s;and. It mu&s;t be owned, that if the king was prodigal of his own per&s;on, he was likewi&s;e very free with the lives of his &s;ubjects. At no time, &s;ince the days of ig|norance and barbarity, have the lives of men been &s;quandered away with &s;uch profu&s;ion as in the cour&s;e of this German war. They have not only been unnece&s;&s;arily &s;acrificed in various exploits of no con&s;equence, but they have been lavi&s;hly expo&s;ed

to all the rigour and di&s;temper of winter-cam|paigns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> which have been introduced on the conti|nent, in de&s;pite of nature, and in contempt of hu|manity. Such are the improvements of warriors without feeling; &s;uch the refinements of German di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>On the day that &s;ucceeded the defeat at Cuner&s;|dorf, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, having lo&s;t the be&s;t part of his army, together with his whole train of ar|tillery, repa&s;&s;ed the Oder, and encamped at Ret|win; from whence he advanced to Fu&s;tenwalde, and &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment the forbearance of the enemy. In&s;tead of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berlin, and overwhelming the wreck of the king's troops, de|&s;titute of cannon, and cut off from all communica|tion with prince Henry, they took no &s;tep to im|prove the victory they had gained. Laudohn re|tired with his hor&s;e immediately after the battle; and count Soltikoff marched with part of the Ru&s;|&s;ians into Lu&s;atia, where he joined Daun, and held con&s;ultations with that general. Perhaps the &s;afety of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch was owing to the jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among his enemies. In all probability the court of Vienna would have been chagrined to &s;ee the Ru&s;&s;ians in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Brandenburgh, and therefore thwarted their de&s;igns upon that electorate. The k&mdash;of P&mdash;had now rea&s;on to be convinced, that his &s;ituation could not ju&s;tify &s;uch a de&s;perate attack as that in which he had mi&s;|carried at Cuner&s;dorf; for if the Ru&s;&s;ians did not attempt the reduction of his capital, now that he was totally defeated, and the flower of his army cut off, they certainly would not have a&s;pired at that conque&s;t while he lay encamped in the neigh|bourhood

The duke was ob|l$ged to change his rout, while Wunch marched from Duben to Eulenburg; and general Wa&s;&s;er|$$eb$n occupied Strehla, where next day the whole army encamped. In this &s;ituation the prince re|mained, till the &s;ixteenth day of November; when, being in danger of having his communication with To$$$u cut off by the enemy, he removed to a &s;trong camp, where his left flank was covered by that city and the river Elbe; his right being $word$ by a wood, and great part of his front by an $word$ mora&s;s.</P>

It was forth|with divided into four columns, which filed off through the neighbouring woods; and the Pru&s;|&s;ians never dreamed of their approach, until they &s;aw them&s;elves intirely &s;urrounded. In this emer|gency they defended them&s;elves with their cannon and mu&s;quetry, until they were overpowered by numbers, and their battery was taken: then they retired to another ri&s;ing-ground, where they ral|lied; but were driven from em$nence to eminence, until, by favour of the night, they made their la&s;t retreat to Falkenhayn. In the mean time, count Daun had made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, that at day-break general Finck &s;ound him&s;elf int$rely inclo&s;ed, with|out the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, and &s;ent a trumpet to count Daun to demand a capitulation.

<P>This misfortune was the more mortifying to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as it implied a cen&s;ure on his con|duct, for having detached &s;uch a numerous body of troops to a &s;ituation where they could not be &s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t of his army.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the court of Vienna exulted in this victory as an infallible proof of Daun's &s;u|perior talents; and, in point of glory and advan|tage, much more than an equivalent for the lo&s;s of the Saxon army, which, though le&s;s numerous, ca|pitulated in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, after having held out &s;ix weeks again&s;t the whole power of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch.</P>

As for Daun, the advantages he had gained did not elevate his mind above the u&s;ual maxims of his cautious di&s;cretion. In&s;tead of at|tacking the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, re&s;pectable and for|midable even in adver&s;ity, he quietly occupied the &s;trong camp at Pirna, where he might be at hand to &s;uccour Dre&s;den, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be attacked, and maintain his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu|&s;ion of the cam|paign.</NOTE> By this time the Ru&s;&s;ians had retired to winter quarters in Poland; and the Swedes, after a fruit|le&s;s excur&s;ion in the ab&s;ence of Manteufel, re|treated to Stral&s;und in the i&s;le of Rugen. This campaign, therefore, did not prove more deci&s;ive than the la&s;t. Abundance of lives were lo&s;t; and great part of Germany was expo&s;ed to rapine, mur|der, famine, de&s;olation, and every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery that war could engender. In vain the confede|rating powers of Au&s;tria, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden, united their efforts to cru&s;h the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. Though his army had been defeated, and he him|&s;elf totally overthrown, with great &s;laughter, in the heart of his own dominions; though he appeared in a de&s;perate &s;ituation, environed by ho&s;tile ar|mies, and two con&s;iderable detached bodies of his troops were taken or de&s;troyed; yet he kept all his adver&s;aries at bay till the approach of winter, which proved his be&s;t auxiliary; and even maintained his footing in the electorate of Saxony, which &s;eemed

It was not therefore to any compunction, or kind forbearance in the court of Vienna, that the inacti|vity of Daun was owing.

They delivered their credentials to the king, with a formal har|rangue: they &s;aid his maje&s;ty would &s;ee, by the contents of the letter they had the honour to pre|&s;ent, how ardently their High Mightine&s;&s;es de|&s;ired to cultivate the &s;incere friend&s;hip which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their common welfare and pre&s;ervation: they expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t wi&s;h, that they might be happy enough to remove tho&s;e difficulties which had for &s;ome time &s;truck at this friend&s;hip, and cau&s;ed &s;o much prejudice to the principal &s;ubjects of the republic; who, by the commerce they carried on, con&s;tituted its greate&s;t &s;trength, and chief &s;up|port. They declared their whole confidence was placed in his maje&s;ty's equity, for which the repub|lic

In an&s;wer to this oration, the king a&s;&s;ured them, that he had always regarded their High Mightine&s;&s;es as his be&s;t friends. He &s;aid, if difficulties had ari&s;en concerning trade, they ought to be con&s;idered as the con&s;equences of a burthen&s;ome war which he was obliged to wage with France. He de&s;ired they would a&s;&s;ure their High Mightine&s;&s;es, that he &s;hould endeavour, on his part, to remove the ob&s;tacles in que&s;tion; and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, that they (the deputies) were come over with the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

They threatened and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> complained by turns, and eagerty &s;eized all oppor|tunities of di&s;playing their partiality in favour of the enemies of Great Britain. In the month of September, major-general York, the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;ter at the Hague, pre&s;ented a memorial to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorial pre&s;ented to the States General, by major-general Yorke.</NOTE> States General, remon&s;trating, that the merchants of Holland carried on a contraband trade in favour of France, by tran&s;porting cannon and warlike &s;tores, from the Baltic to Holland, in Dutch bot|toms, under the borrowed names of private per|&s;ons; and then conveying them by the inland ri|vers and canals, or through the Dutch fortre&s;&s;es to Dunkirk and other places of France. He de|&s;ired that the king his ma&s;ter might be made ea&s;y on that head, by their putting an immediate &s;top to &s;uch practices, &s;o repugnant to the connections &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by treaty, between Great Britain and the United Provinces, as well as to every idea of neu|trality.

He reminded them that their trading towns felt the good effects of the&s;e re&s;trictions; and that the freedom of navigation, which their &s;ubjects enjoyed amid&s;t the troubles and di&s;tractions of Europe, had con&s;iderably augmented their com|merce. He ob&s;erved, that &s;ome return ought to be made to &s;uch &s;olid proofs of the king's friend|&s;hip and moderation; at lea&s;t, the merchants, who

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1759.</NOTE> were &s;o ready to complain of England, ought not to be countenanced in exce&s;&s;es which would have ju&s;tified the mo&s;t rigorous examination of their conduct. He recalled to their memories, that, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent war, the king had &s;everal times applied to their High Mightine&s;&s;es, and to their mini&s;ters, on the liberty they had given to carry &s;tores through the fortre&s;&s;es of the republic for the u&s;e of France, to invade the Briti&s;h dominions; and though his maje&s;ty had pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence many of the&s;e in&s;tances of complai&s;ance to his enemy, he was no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the injury; but he cho&s;e rather to be a &s;uf|ferer him&s;elf, than to encrea&s;e the embarra&s;&s;ment of his neighbours, or extend the flames of war. He took notice that even the court of Vienna had&punc; upon more than one occa&s;ion, employed its intere&s;t with their High Mightine&s;&s;es, and lent its name to obtain pa&s;&s;es for warlike &s;tores and provi&s;ions for the French troops, under colour of the Barrier Treaty, which it no longer ob&s;erved: nay, after having put France in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of O&s;tend and Nieuport, in manife&s;t violation of that treaty, and without any regard to the rights which they and the king his ma&s;ter had acquired in that treaty, a$ the expence of &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure.</P>

threats with his expo&s;tulation. He de&s;ired them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759&punc;</NOTE> to remember, that during the whole cour&s;e of the war, the French king had required nothing from their friend&s;hip that was incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality; and if he had deviated from the engagements &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the republic, it was only by granting the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and lucrative favours to the &s;ubjects of their High Mightine&s;&s;es. He ob&s;erved that the Engli&s;h, not|with&s;tanding the in&s;olence of their behaviour to the republic, had derived, on many occa&s;ions, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the protection their effects had found in the territories of the United Provinces: that the artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition belonging to We&s;&s;el were depo&s;ited in their territories, which the Hanoverian army in pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine had very little re&s;pected: that when they repa&s;&s;ed that river, they had no other way of &s;aving their &s;ick and wounded from the hands of the French, than by embarking them in boats, and conveying them to places where the French left them unmole&s;ted, actuated by their re&s;pect for the neutrality of the republic: that part of their magazines was &s;till depo&s;ited in the towns of the United Provinces; where al&s;o the enemies of France had purcha&s;ed and contracted for very con&s;iderable quantities of gunpowder. He told them, that tho' the&s;e and &s;everal other circum&s;tances might have been made the &s;ubject of the ju&s;te&s;t complaints, the king of France did not think it proper to require that the freedom and independency of the &s;ubjects of the republic &s;hould be re&s;trained in branches of com|merce that were not incon&s;i&s;tent with its neutra|lity,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> per&s;uaded that the faith of an engagement ought to be inviolably pre&s;erved, though attended with &s;ome accidental and tran&s;ient di&s;advantages; he gave them to under&s;tand, that the king his ma|&s;ter had ordered the generals of his army carefully to avoid encroaching on the territory of the re|public, and transferring thither the theatre of the war, when his enemies retreated that way before they were forced to repa&s;s the Rhine. After &s;uch unque&s;tionable marks of regard, he &s;aid, his king would have the ju&s;te&s;t ground of complaint, if, contrary to expectation, he &s;hould hear that the artillery and &s;tores belonging to him were de|tained at Am&s;terdam. Thirdly, he declared that &s;uch detention would be con&s;trued as a violation of the neutrality; and demanded, in the name of the king his ma&s;ter, that the artillery and &s;tores &s;hould be, without delay, forwarded to Flan|ders by the canals of Am&s;terdam and the inland navigation. This la&s;t argument was &s;o conclu&s;ive, that they immediately granted the nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;s|ports, in con&s;equence of which the cannon were conveyed to the Au&s;trian Netherlands.</P>
<P>The powers in the &s;outhern parts of Europe were too much engro&s;&s;ed with their own concerns, to intere&s;t them&s;elves deeply in the quarrels that di&s;tracted the German empire. The king of Spain, naturally of a melancholy complexion, and delicate con&s;titution, was &s;o deeply affected with the lo&s;s of his queen, who died in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, that he renounced all company, neglected all bu&s;ine&s;s, and immured him&s;elf in a chamber at Villa Vicio&s;a, where he gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t

extravagant &s;orrow. He ab&s;tained from food and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> re&s;t until his &s;trength was quite exhau&s;ted. He would neither &s;hift him&s;elf, nor allow his beard to be &s;haved: he rejected all attempts of con&s;olation, and remained deaf to the mo&s;t earne&s;t and re|&s;pectful remon&s;trances of tho&s;e who had a right to tender their advice. In this ca&s;e, the affliction of the mind mu&s;t have been reinforced by &s;ome pecu|liarity in the con&s;titution. He inherited a melan|choly taint from his father, and this &s;eems to have been dreaded as a family di&s;ea&s;e; for the infant Don Lewis, who likewi&s;e re&s;ided at the palace of Villa Vicio&s;a, was fain to amu&s;e him&s;elf with hunt|ing, and other diver&s;ions, to prevent his being in|fected with the king's di&s;order, which continued to gain ground, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of me|dicine. The Spani&s;h nation, naturally &s;uper&s;ti|tious, had recour&s;e to &s;aints and relicks; but they &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to their devotion. The king, however, in the mid&s;t of all his di&s;tre&s;s, was pre|vailed upon to make his will, which was written by the count de Valparai&s;o, and &s;igned by the duke of Bejar, high chancellor of the kingdom. The exorbitancy of his grief, and the mortifications he underwent, &s;oon produced an incurable malady, under which he langui&s;hed from the month of Sep|tember in the preceding year, till the tenth of Augu&s;t in the pre&s;ent, when he expired. In his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the king of Spain.</NOTE> will he had appointed his brother Don Carlos, king of Naples, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of Spain; and nominated the queen-dowager as a regent of the kingdom, until that prince &s;hould arrive. Ac|cordingly &s;he a&s;&s;umed the reins of government, and gave directions for the funeral of the decea&s;ed

Franci&s;co de A&s;&s;iz, marquis of Tavora, conde of St. John and Alvor, was gene|ral of the hor&s;e, and head of the third noble hou&s;e of the Tavoras, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious family in the kingdom, deriving their origin from the antient kings of Leon: he married his own kin&s;woman, who was marchione&s;s of Tavora in her own right, and by this marriage acquired the marqui&s;ate. Louis Bernardo de Tavora was their elde&s;t &s;on, who, by virtue of a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope, had e&s;pou&s;ed his own aunt, Donna There&s;a de Ta|vora. Jo&s;eph Maria de Tavora, his younge&s;t bro|ther, was al&s;o involved in the guilt of his parents.

Her re&s;entment again&s;t the king was inflamed by the mortification of her pride in repeated repul&s;es, when &s;he &s;ollicited the title of duke for her hu&s;band. Her pa&s;&s;ions were artfully fomented and managed by the Je&s;uits, to whom &s;he had re&s;igned the government of her con|&s;cience; and they are &s;aid to have per&s;uaded her, that it would be a meritorious action to take away the life of a prince who was an enemy to the church, and a tyrant to his people. She, being re|conciled to the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, exerted her influence in &s;uch a manner as to inveigle her hu&s;|band, her &s;ons, and &s;on-in-law, into the &s;ame in|famous de&s;ign; and yet this lady had been always remarkable for her piety, affability, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition.

The dutche&s;s of Aveiro, the counte&s;s of Attouguia, and the mar|chione&s;s of Alorna, with their children, were &s;ent to different nunneries; and eight Je&s;uits were taken into cu&s;tody. A council being appointed for the trial of the pri&s;oners, the particulars we have related were brought to light by the torture; and &s;entence of death was pronounced and executed upon the convicted criminals. Eight wheels were fixed upon a &s;caffold, rai&s;ed in the &s;quare oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e where the pri&s;oners had been con|fined, and the thirteenth of January was fixed for the day of execution. Antonio Alvarez Ferreira, one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who had fired into the king's equipage, was fixed to a &s;take at one corner of the &s;caffold; and at the other was placed the effigies of his accomplice, Jo&s;eph Policarpio de Azevedo, who had made his e&s;cape. The marchione&s;s of Tavora, being brought upon the &s;caffold between eight and nine in the morning, was beheaded at one &s;troke, and then covered with a linnen cloth. Her two &s;ons, and her &s;on-in-law the count of At|touguia, with three &s;ervants of the duke de Aveiro, were fir&s;t &s;trangled at one &s;take, and afterwards broke upon wheels, where their bodies remained covered: but the duke and the marquis, as chiefs of the con&s;piracy, were broke alive, and under|went the mo&s;t excruciating torments. The la&s;t
<PB N="281" REF="3040">
that &s;uffered was the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in Alvarez, who being<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> condemned to be burnt alive, the combu&s;tibles, which had been placed under the &s;caffold, were &s;et on fire, the whole machine with their bodies con|&s;umed to a&s;hes, and the&s;e a&s;hes thrown into the &s;ea. The e&s;tates of the three unfortunate noble|men were confi&s;cated, and their dwelling-hou&s;es razed to the ground. The name of Tavora was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for ever by a public decree; but that of Ma&s;carenha &s;pared, becau&s;e the duke de Aveiro was a younger branch of the family. A reward of ten thou&s;and crowns was offered to any per&s;on who &s;hould apprehend the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in who had e&s;caped: then the embargo was taken off the &s;hipping. The king and royal family a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a public Te Deum, &s;ung in the chapel of No&s;&s;a Senhora de Livramen|to; on which occa&s;ion the king, for the &s;atisfac|tion of his people, waved his handkerchief with both hands, to &s;hew he was not maimed by the wounds he had received. If &s;uch an attempt upon the life of a king was infamou&s;ly cruel and perfi|dious, it mu&s;t be owned, that the puni&s;hment in|flicted upon the criminals was horrible to human nature. The attempt it&s;elf was attended with &s;ome circum&s;tances that might have &s;taggered belief, had it not appeared but too plain that the king was actually wounded. One would imagine, that the duke de Aveiro, who was charged with de&s;igns on the crown, &s;hould have made &s;ome prepara|tions for taking advantage of the confu&s;ion and di&s;order which mu&s;t have been produced by the king's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; but we do not find that any thing of this nature was premeditated. It was no more than a de&s;perate &s;cheme of per&s;onal revenge,
<PB N="282" REF="3050">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> conceived without caution, and executed without conduct: a circum&s;tance the more extraordinary, if we &s;uppo&s;e the con&s;pirators were actuated by the coun&s;els of the Je&s;uits, who have been ever fa|mous for fine&s;&s;e and dexterity. Be&s;ides, the di&s;|covery of all the particulars was founded upon con|fe&s;&s;ion extorted by the rack, which, at be&s;t, is a &s;u&s;picious evidence. Be that as it will, the Portu|gue&s;e government, without waiting for a bull from the pope, &s;eque&s;tered all the e&s;tates and effects of the Je&s;uits in that kingdom, which amounted to con&s;iderable &s;u$s, and reduced the individuals of the &s;ociety to a very canty $ll$wance. Complaints of their conduct having been made to the pope, he appointed a congregation to examine into the affairs of the J$$ui$$ in Portugal. In the mean time, the court of Li&s;bon ordered a con&s;iderable number of them to be embarked for Italy, and re|&s;olved that no Je&s;uit &s;hould hereafter re&s;ide with|in its realms. When the&s;e tran&s;ports arrived at Civita Vecchia. they were&punc; by the pope's order, lodged in the Dominican and Capuchin convents of that city, until proper hou&s;es could be prepared for their reception at Tivoli and Fre&s;cati. The mo&s;t guilty of them, however, were detained in clo&s;e p$i&s;onin Portugal, re&s;erved, in all probability, for a puni&s;hment more adequate to their enormi|ties.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;e&s;|&s;ion of parlia|ment opened by com|mi&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> England &s;till continued to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, even amid&s;t the triumphs of war. In the month of November the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened by commi&s;&s;ion; and, the commons attend|ing in the hou&s;e of peers, the lord-keeper ha|rangued the parliament to this effect: he gave
<PB N="283" REF="3060">
them to under&s;tand, that his maje&s;ty had directed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> him to a&s;&s;ure them, that he thought him&s;elf pecu|liarly happy in being able to convoke them in a &s;ituation of affairs &s;o glorious to his crown, and ad|vantageous to his kingdoms: that the king &s;aw and devoutly adored the hand of Providence, in the many &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, both by &s;ea and land, with which his arms had been ble&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t campaign: that he reflected with great &s;atisfaction on the confidence which the parliament had placed in him, by making &s;uch ample provi|&s;ions, and intru&s;ting him with &s;uch exten&s;ive pow|ers, for carrying on a war which the defence of their valuable rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, together with the pre&s;ervation of the commerce of his people, had rendered both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. He enume|rated the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h arms, the re|duction of Goree on the coa&s;t of Africa, the con|que&s;t of &s;o many important places in America, the defeat of the French army in Canada, the reduction of their capital city Quebec, effected with &s;o much honour to the courage and conduct of his maje&s;ty's officers and forces, the important advantage ob|tained by the Briti&s;h &s;quadron off Cape Lagos, and the effectual blocking up for &s;o many months the principal part of the French navy in their own harbours: events which mu&s;t have filled the hearts of all his maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects with the &s;incere&s;t joy; and convinced his parliament, that there had been no want of vigilance or vigour on his part, in exerting tho&s;e means which they with &s;o much prudence and public-&s;pirited zeal had put into his maje&s;ty's hands. He ob&s;erved, that the national advantages had extended even as far as
<PB N="284" REF="3070">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the Ea&s;t Indies, where, by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, the dangerous de&s;igns of his maje&s;ty's enemies had mi&s;carried, and that valuable branch of commerce had received great benefit and protection. That the memorable victory gained over the French at Minden, had long made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of his maje&s;ty's people: that if the cri&s;is in which the battle was fought, the &s;uperior number of the enemy, the great and able conduct of his maje&s;ty's general, prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wic, were con&s;idered, that action mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of la&s;ting admiration and thankfulne&s;s: that if any thing could fill the brea&s;ts of his maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects with &s;till farther degrees of exultation, it would be the di&s;tingui&s;hed and unbroken valour of the Briti&s;h troops, owned and applauded by tho&s;e whom they overcame. He &s;aid, the glory they had gained was not merely their own, but, in a national view, was one of the mo&s;t important cir|cum&s;tances of our &s;ucce&s;s, as it mu&s;t be a &s;triking admonition to our enemies with whom they have to contend. He told them, that his maje&s;ty's good brother and ally the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, attacked and &s;urrounded by &s;o many con&s;iderable powers, had by his magnanimity and abilities, and the bravery of his troops, been able, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, to prevent the mi&s;chiefs concerted with &s;uch united force again&s;t him. He declared, by the command of his &s;overeign, that as his maje&s;ty entered into this war not from views of ambition, &s;o he did not wi&s;h to continue it from motives of re&s;entment: that the de&s;ire of his maje&s;ty's heart was to &s;ee a &s;top put to the effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood: that, whenever &s;uch terms of peace could be e&s;tabli&s;hed,

as &s;hould be ju&s;t and honourable for his maje&s;ty<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and his allies; and by procuring &s;uch advantages as, from the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his maje&s;ty's arms, might in rea&s;on and equity be expected, &s;hould bring along with them full &s;ecurity for the future, his maje&s;ty would rejoice to &s;ee the repo&s;e of Europe re&s;tored on &s;uch &s;olid and durable foundations; and his faithful &s;ubjects, to who&s;e liberal &s;upport and un&s;haken firmne&s;s his maje&s;ty owed &s;o much, hap|py in the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and tranquillity: but, in order to this great and de&s;ire|able end, he &s;aid his maje&s;ty was confident the par|liament would agree with him, that it was nece&s;|&s;ary to make ample provi&s;ion for carrying on the war, in all parts, with the utmo&s;t vigour. He a&s;|&s;ured the commons, that the great &s;upplies they had granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, had been faithfully employed for the purpo&s;es for which they were granted; but the uncommon extent of the war, and the various &s;ervices nece&s;&s;ary to be pro|vided for, in order to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s to his maje&s;ty's mea&s;ures, had unavoidably occa&s;ioned extraordi|nary expences. Finally, he repeated the a&s;&s;urances from the throne of the high &s;atisfaction his maje&s;ty took in that union and good harmony, which was &s;o con&s;picuous among his good &s;ubjects: he &s;aid, his &s;overeign was happy in &s;eeing it continued and confirmed: he ob&s;erved, that experience had &s;hewn how much the nation owed to this union, which alone could &s;ecure the true happine&s;s of his people.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not anticipate the reader's own reflec|tion, by pretending to comment upon either the matter or the form of this harangue, which, how|ever,
<PB N="286" REF="3090">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> produced all the effect which the &s;overeign could de&s;ire. The hou&s;es, in their re&s;pective ad|dre&s;&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sub&s;tance of the ad|dre&s;&s;es.</NOTE> &s;eemed to vie with each other in expre&s;&s;ions of attachment and complacency. The peers pro|fe&s;&s;ed their utmo&s;t readine&s;s to concur in the ef|fectual &s;upport of &s;uch further mea&s;ures as his maje&s;ty, in his <HI>great wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;hould judge nece&s;&s;ary or expedient for carrying on the war with vigour in all parts, and for di&s;appointing and repelling any de&s;perate attempts which might be made upon the&s;e kingdoms. The commons expre&s;&s;ed their admiration of that true greatne&s;s of mind, which di&s;po&s;ed his maje&s;ty's heart, in the mid&s;t of pro&s;|perities, to wi&s;h a &s;top put to the effu&s;ion of Chri&s;|tian blood, and to &s;ee tranquillity re&s;tored. They declared their entire reliance on his maje&s;ty's known wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, that this de&s;ireable object, whenever it &s;hould be obtained, would be upon terms ju&s;t and honourable for his maje&s;ty and his allies; and, in order to effect that great end, they a&s;&s;ured him they would chearfully grant &s;uch &s;up|plies as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain, and pre&s;s with effect, all his exten&s;ive operations again&s;t the enemy. They did not fail to re-eccho the &s;peech as u&s;ual, enumerating the trophies of the year, and extolling the king of Pru&s;&s;ia for his con|&s;ummate genius, magnanimity, unwearied activity, and un&s;haken con&s;tancy of mind.</P>
<P>Very great rea&s;on, indeed, had his maje&s;ty to be &s;atisfied with an addre&s;s of &s;uch a nature from an hou&s;e of commons, in which oppo&s;ition lay &s;tran|gled at the foot of the mini&s;ter; in which tho&s;e de|magogues, who had rai&s;ed them&s;elves to reputation and renown, by declaiming again&s;t continental

Thus di&s;po&s;ed, it was no wonder they admired the moderation of their &s;overeign, in offering to treat of peace, after above a million of men had peri&s;hed by the war, and twice that number been reduced to mi&s;ery; after whole provinces had been depopulated, whole coun|tries &s;ubdued, and the victors them&s;elves almo&s;t cru&s;hed by the trophies they had gained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted for the expence of the year 1760.</NOTE> Immediately after the addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented, the commons re&s;olved them&s;elves into a committee of the whole hou&s;e, and having unanimou&s;ly voted a &s;upply to his maje&s;ty, began to take the particu|lars into con&s;ideration.

Nay, many per&s;ons affirmed, that what was propo&s;ed looked more like a &s;cheme for increa&s;ing the public revenue, than a &s;alutary mea|&s;ure to prevent exce&s;s. The merchants and manu|facturers of the town of Birmingham petitioned for &s;uch re&s;trictions.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> on beer and ale, &s;o as to enable the poorer cla&s;s of labourers to refre&s;h them&s;elves with a comfortable liquor, for nearly the &s;ame expence that will pro|cure a quantity of geneva &s;ufficient for intoxica|tion; for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a poor wretch will expend his la&s;t penny upon a draught of &s;mall beer, without &s;trength or the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory ope|ration, when for the half of that &s;um he can pur|cha&s;e a cordial, that will almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly allay the &s;en&s;e of hunger and cold, and regale his imagination with the mo&s;t agreeable illu&s;ions.

It appears, then, that in the reign of James the &s;ubject payed but four pence for a gallon of &s;trong beer, which now co&s;ts a &s;hilling; and as the malt is not encrea&s;ed in value, the difference in the price mu&s;t be intirely owing to the taxes on beer, malt, and hops, which are in|deed very grievous, though perhaps nece&s;&s;ary. The duty on &s;mall beer is certainly one of the heavie&s;t taxes impo&s;ed upon any &s;ort of con&s;ump|tion, that cannot be con&s;idered as an article of

Yet, as undoubted evidence had proved before the com|mittee, while the bill was depending, that the im|portation had been of great &s;ervice to England, particularly in reducing the price of &s;alted beef for the u&s;e of the navy, perhaps no con&s;ideration ought to have prevented the legi&s;lature from per|petuating the law; a mea&s;ure that would encourage the graziers of Ireland to breed and fatten horned cattle, and certainly put a &s;top to the practice of exporting &s;alted beef from that kingdom to France, which undoubtedly furni&s;hes the traders of that kingdom with opportunities of exporting wool to the &s;ame country.</P>

When the motion was made for the bill's being committed, a warm debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which, many Scot|ti&s;h members &s;poke in behalf of their country, with great force of argument, and a very laudable &s;pirit of freedom.

hou&s;es, and received the royal a&s;&s;ent by commi&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> During the dependance of this bill, another was brought in to explain &s;o much of the militia act pa&s;&s;ed in the thirty-fir&s;t year of his maje&s;ty's reign, as related to the money to be given to private mi|litia-men, upon their being ordered out into actual &s;ervice. By this law it was enacted, that the guinea which by the former act was due to every private man of every regiment or company of mi|litia, when ordered out into actual &s;ervice, &s;hould be payed to every man that &s;hall afterwards be en|rolled into &s;uch regiment or company whil&s;t in ac|tual &s;ervice: that no man &s;hould be intitled to his cloaths for his own u&s;e, until he &s;hould have &s;er|ved three years, if unembodied, or one year, if embodied, after the delivery of the cloaths; and that the full pay of the militia &s;hould commence from the date of his maje&s;ty's warrant for drawing them out. The difficulties which the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive regulations were made to obviate, will be amply recompenced by the good effects of a national mi|litia, provided it be employed in a national way, and for national purpo&s;es: but if the militia are embodied, and the different regiments that com|po&s;e it are marched from the re&s;pective counties to which they belong; if the men are detained for any length of time, in actual &s;ervice, at a di&s;tance from their families, when they might be employed at home in works of indu&s;try, for the &s;upport of their natural dependants; the militia becomes no other than an addition to, or augmentation of a &s;tanding army enli&s;ted for the term of three years. The labour of the men is lo&s;t to the community; they contract the idle habits and di&s;&s;olute man|ners
<PB N="320" REF="3430">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of the other troops; their families are left as incumbrances on the community; and the charge of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is, at lea&s;t, as heavy as that of maintaining an equal number of regular forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti|ons on that in|&s;titution.</NOTE> It would not, we apprehend, be very ea&s;y to account for the g&mdash;t's ordering the regi|ments of militia to march from their re&s;pective counties, and do duty for a con&s;iderable length of time, at a great di&s;tance from their own homes; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e this mea&s;ure was taken to create in the people a di&s;gu&s;t to the in&s;titution of the mi|litia, which was an e&s;tabli&s;hment extorted from the &s;&mdash;by the voice of the nation. We may add, that &s;ome of the inconveniencies attending a militia, will never be totally removed, while the per&s;ons drawn by lot for that &s;ervice are at liberty to hire &s;ub&s;titutes; for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that men of &s;ub&s;tance will incur the danger, fatigue, and damage of &s;erving in per&s;on, while they can hire among the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people, mercenaries of de&s;perate fortune and abandoned morals, who will greedily &s;eize the opportunity of being payed for renouncing that labour by which they were be|fore obliged to maintain them&s;elves and their fa|mily connexions: it would therefore de&s;erve the con&s;ideration of the legi&s;lature, whether the pri|vilege of hiring &s;ub&s;titutes &s;hould not be limited to certain cla&s;&s;es of men, who are either rai&s;ed by their rank in life above the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;erving in per&s;on, or engaged in &s;uch occupations as can|not be intermitted without prejudice to the com|monwealth. It mu&s;t be allowed, that the regula|tion in this new act, by which the families of &s;ub|&s;titutes are deprived of any relief from the pari&s;h,

will not only dimini&s;h the burden of the poor's<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759&punc;</NOTE> rates; but al&s;o, by rai&s;ing the $$ice of mercena|ries, oblige a greater number of t$e better &s;ort to &s;erve in per&s;on. Without all doubt, the $ewer &s;ub&s;titutes that are employed the more dependence may be placed upon the militia, i$ the pre&s;ervation of our rights and privileges; and the more will the number of the di&s;ciplined men be increa&s;ed, becau&s;e at the expiration of every three years, the lot&punc;men mu&s;t be changed, and new militia-men cho&s;en; but the &s;ub&s;titutes will, in all probability, continue for life in the &s;ervice, provided they can find lot-men to hire them at every rotation.

<P>In the latter end of November the hou&s;e of commons received a petition of &s;everal noblemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill fo$ removing the pow|der-ma|gazine from Green|wich&punc;</NOTE> gentlemen, and others, inhabitants of Ea&s;t Green|wich, and places adjacent, in Kent, repre&s;enting, that in the &s;aid pari&s;h, within a quarter of a mile of the town di&s;tingui&s;hed by a royal palace, and royal ho&s;pital for &s;eamen, there was a magazine, containing great quantities of gunpowder, fre|quently to the amount of &s;ix thou&s;and barrels; that be&s;ides the great danger which mu&s;t attend all places of that kind, the &s;aid magazine &s;tood in an open field, uninclo&s;ed by any fortification o$ defence what&s;oever, con&s;equently expo&s;ed to treachery, and every other accident. They al|ledged, that if, through treachery, lightning, or any other accident, this magazine &s;hould take fire, not only their lives and properties, but the palace and ho&s;pital, the king's yards and &s;tores at Dept|ford and Woolwich, the banks and navigation of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the Thames, with the &s;hips &s;ailing and at anchor in that river, would be inevitably de&s;troyed; and in|conceivable damage would accrue to the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. They moreover ob&s;erved, that the magazine was then in a dangerous condi|tion, &s;upported on all &s;ides by props that were de|cayed at the foundation; that, in ca&s;e it &s;hould fall, the powder would in all probability, take fire, and produce the dreadful calamities above recited; they therefore prayed, that the magazine might be re|moved to &s;ome more convenient place, where any accident would not be attended with &s;uch di&s;mal con&s;equences. The &s;ubject of this remon&s;trance was &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and important, that a committee was im|mediately appointed to take the affair into con&s;ide|ration, and procure an e&s;timate for purcha&s;ing lands and erecting a powder-magazine at Purfleet in E&s;&s;ex, near the banks of the river, together with guard-hou&s;e, barracks, and all other nece&s;&s;ary con|veniences. While the report of the committee lay upon the table for the peru&s;al of the members, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, by his maje&s;ty's command, acquainted the hou&s;e, that the king, having been informed of the &s;ubject-matter of the petition, recommended it to the con&s;ideration of the commons. Leave was immediately given to prepare a bill, founded on the re&s;olutions of the committee; which, having been duly con&s;idered, altered, and amended, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es to the foot of the throne, where it obtained the royal &s;anction. The magazine was accordingly re|moved to Purfleet, an incon&s;iderable and &s;olitary village, where there will be little danger of acci|dent, and where no great damage would attend an explo&s;ion: but, in order to render this po&s;&s;ible

explo&s;ion &s;till le&s;s dangerous, it would be nece&s;&s;ary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to form the magazine of &s;mall di&s;tinct apartments, totally independent of each other, that, in ca&s;e one &s;hould be accidentally blown up, the re&s;t might &s;tand unaffected. The &s;ame plan ought to be adopted in the con&s;truction of all combu&s;tible &s;tores, &s;ubject to conflagration.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for improv|ing the &s;treets of London.</NOTE> The next affair that engro&s;&s;ed the deliberation of the commons, was a mea&s;ure relating to the in|ternal oeconomy of the metropolis. The &s;heriffs of London delivered a petition of the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons, in common council a&s;|&s;embled, repre&s;enting, that &s;everal &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;&s;ages within the city of London, and liber|ties thereof, were too narrow and incommodious for the pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing as well of foot&punc;pa&s;&s;en|gers as of coaches, carts, and other carriages, to the prejudice and inconvenience of the owners and inhabitants of hou&s;es, and to the great hindrance of bu&s;ine&s;s, trade, and commerce. They alledged, that the&s;e defects might be remedied, and &s;everal new &s;treets opened within the &s;aid city and liber|ties, to the great ea&s;e, &s;afety, and convenience of pa&s;&s;engers, as well as to the advantage of the pub|lic in general, if they, the petitioners, were en|abled to widen and enlarge the narrow &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;&s;ages, to open and lay out &s;uch new &s;treets and ways, and to purcha&s;e the &s;everal hou&s;es, buildings, and grounds, which might be nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e purpo&s;es. They took notice, that there were &s;everal hou&s;es, within the city and liberties, partly elected over the ground of other proprie|tors;
<PB N="324" REF="3470">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and others, of which the &s;everal floors or apartments belonged to different per&s;ons; &s;o that difficulties and di&s;putes frequently aro&s;e among&s;t the &s;aid &s;everal owners and proprietors, about pull|ing down or rebuilding the party-walls and pre|mi&s;&s;es; that &s;uch rebuilding was often prevented&punc; or delayed, to the great injury and inconvenience of tho&s;e owners who were de&s;irous to rebuild; that it would therefore be of public benefit, and fre|quently prevent the &s;preading of the fatal effects of fire, if &s;ome provi&s;ion were made by law, as well for determining &s;uch di&s;putes in a &s;ummary way, as for explaining and amending the laws then in being relating to the building of party walls. They therefore prayed, that leave might be given to bring in a bill for enabling the petitioners to widen and enlarge the &s;everal &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;&s;ages, and to open new &s;treets and ways, to be therein limited and de&s;cribed; as well as for deter|mining, in a &s;ummary way, all di&s;putes ari&s;ing about the rebuilding of hou&s;es or tenements with|in the &s;aid cities and liberties, wherein &s;everal per|&s;ons have an intermixed property; and for explain|ing and amending the laws in being relating to the&s;e particulars. A committee being appointed to exa|mine the matter of this petition, agreed to a re|port, upon which leave was given to prepare a bill, and this was brought in accordingly. Next day a great number of citizens repre&s;ented, in another petition, that the pavement of the city and liber|ties was often damaged, by being broken up for the purpo&s;es of amending or new laying water|pipes belonging to the proprietors of water-works; and praying, that provi&s;ion might be made in the bill then depending, to compel tho&s;e proprietors to

make good any damage that &s;hould be done to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> pavement by the leaking or bur&s;ting of the water|pipes, or opening the pavement for alterations. In con&s;equence of this repre&s;entation, &s;ome amend|ments were made in the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, and was enacted into a law, under the title of "An act for widening certain &s;treets, lanes, and pa&s;&s;ages, within the city of London and liberties thereof; and for opening certain new &s;treets and ways within the &s;ame, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The openings to be made, and the pa&s;&s;ages to be improved and enlarged, were a&s;certained by two &s;chedules, annexed to the act. With re&s;pect to the hou&s;es, build|ings, and grounds to be pur|cha&s;ed, the mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city, in common council a&s;&s;embled, or a committee appointed by them, were impowered to fix the price by agreement with the re&s;pective proprietors, or otherwi&s;e by a jury in the u&s;ual manner. With regard to party-walls, the act or|dains, that the proprietor of either adjoining hou&s;e may compel the proprietor of the other to agree to its being pulled down and rebuilt, and to pay a moiety of the ex|pence even though it &s;hould not be nece&s;&s;ary to pull down or rebuild either of their hou&s;es: that all party-walls &s;hall be, at lea&s;t, two bricks and a half in thickne&s;s in the cellar, and two bricks thick upwards to the top of the garret-floor. It enacts, that if any decayed hou&s;e belongs to &s;everal proprietors, any one of them, who is de&s;irous to rebuild, may oblige the others to concur, and join with him in the expence, or purcha&s;e their &s;hares at a price to be fixed by a jury. If any hou&s;e &s;hould hereafter be pre&s;ented by an inque&s;t, or grand jury, in London, as being in a ruin|ous condition, the court of mayor and aldermen is, by this act, impowered to pull it down at the expence of the ground-landlord. As to da|maged pavements, not &s;uffi|ciently repaired by the pro|prietors of the water-works, any ju&s;tice of the peace in London is ve&s;ted with power, upon their refu&s;ing or delay|ing to make it good, to cau&s;e it to be effectually relayed with good materials at their expence.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New act for a&s;cer|taining the quali|fications of mem|bers of parlia|ment.</NOTE> The next law we &s;hall mention was intended to be one of the mo&s;t important that ever fell under the cognizance of the legi&s;lature: it was a law that affected the freedom, dignity, and independency of parliaments. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in the ninth year of the reign of queen Anne, it was provided that no per&s;on &s;hould be cho&s;en member of parliament, who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s in England or Wales, an e&s;|tate, freehold or copy-hold, for life, according to the following qualifications: for every knight of a &s;hire, &s;ix hundred pounds per annum, over and above what will &s;atisfy all incumbrances; and three hundred pounds per annum for every citizen, bur|ge&s;s, and baron of the cinque-port. It was al&s;o decreed, that the return of any per&s;on not thus qualified &s;hould be void; and that every candidate &s;hould, at the rea&s;onable reque&s;t of any other can|didate at the time of election, or by two or more

So many oaths of different kinds had been pre&s;cribed &s;ince the Revolution, that they began to lo&s;e the effect they were intended to have on the minds of men; and, in particular, political perjury grew &s;o com|mon, that it was no longer con&s;idered as a crime. Subterfuges were di&s;covered, by means of which this law relating to the qualification of candidates was effectually eluded. Tho&s;e who were not ac|tually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch e&s;tates procured temporary conveyances&punc; from their friends and patrons, on condition of their being re&s;tored and cancelled after the election. By this &s;candalous fraud, the inten|tion of the legi&s;lature was fru&s;trated; the dignity of parliament pro&s;tituted; the example of perjury and corruption extended; and the vengeance of heaven &s;et at defiance.</P>

<P>The legi&s;lature did not refu&s;e their attention even to the mo&s;t humble articles of national oeconomy. In the beginning of February, a petition was pre|&s;ented

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to the hou&s;e by the inhabitants of the coun|ties of Pembroke, Cardigan, and Merioneth, al|ledging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law con|cerning the ex|portation of culm from Milford Haven.</NOTE> that lime being the chief manure for land in the&s;e counties, without which it would not pro|duce any tolerable crops of corn, the culm u&s;ed in burning it, as well as the lime&s;tone, was brought from Milford Haven, and the lower parts of the county of Pembroke, by water, to the upper parts of that county, and al&s;o to Cardigan&s;hire and Me|rioneth&s;hire, where there were no lime&s;tones, nor veins of culm and coal: that the petitioners were greatly aggrieved, by being obliged to pay the duty on &s;uch culm; and by other great difficulties and expences to which they were &s;ubjected in pro|curing culm for the aforementioned purpo&s;e. They pointed out the good con&s;equences that would ari&s;e from the indulgence of the hou&s;e, &s;hould it grant them relief in this particular, of which they ex|pre&s;&s;ed their hope accordingly.</P>
<P>The commons, having peru&s;ed a number of ac|counts relating to the exportation of culm from Milford Haven, and the duties paid on this article, ordered a bill to be brought in for rendering the exportation of culm from Milford Haven, and the limits thereof, more ea&s;y to the proprietors and purcha&s;ers, and for the better &s;ecuring the duties payable thereon. By this new law it was enacted, that if any per&s;on &s;hould have occa&s;ion to carry culm for the burning of lime, in any ve&s;&s;el not exceeding thirty tons, from any place within the limits of Milford Haven, to any other place within the counties of Pembroke, Carmarthen, Cardi|gan, or Merioneth, the collector, or his deputy, &s;hould, upon application from the ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="343" REF="3670">
ve&s;&s;el, grant him a &s;ufferance, mentioning the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> quantity of culm to be &s;hipped: that the officer to whom the &s;ufferance was directed, &s;hould attend the &s;hipping thereof, and certify on, the back of the &s;ufferance, the quantity &s;hipped: that, upon paying the duty of one &s;hilling per chaldron, the collector, or his deputy, &s;hould grant a certificate, &s;pecifying the quantity &s;hipped, and that the du|ties had been duly paid; which certificate &s;hould be a &s;ufficient let pa&s;s or clearance of &s;uch ve&s;&s;el, to any place within the counties afore&s;aid; and that no officer &s;hould demand or take any other fee, either upon account of granting the &s;aid &s;uf|ferance or certificate, or other pretence what&s;oever relating to the loading or &s;ailing of &s;uch ve&s;&s;el. It was al&s;o enacted, that the ma&s;ter, on his return, &s;hould make oath before the collector, or his de|puty, where and when he landed his former cargo, before being permitted to &s;hip any new cargo, or quantity of culm; with a penalty for preventing fraud, and provi&s;ion for &s;hipping a like cargo, duty free, in ca&s;e the former &s;hould have been lo&s;t. Thus a grievance, which had remained above &s;ixty years, was at length redre&s;&s;ed; and pity it is, that the circum&s;tances of the nation will not permit the whole duty on coal and culm to be intirely removed, as it falls &s;o heavy upon manufacture, as well as up|on people in the middle and lower cla&s;s of life, who live in a climate which requires the u&s;e of fire and fuel for &s;even or eight months in the year.</P>

They therefore in&s;tructed the committee of ways and means, to con&s;ider &s;o much of the annuity and lottery act pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, as related to the three per centum annuities, amounting to the &s;um of &s;even millions five hundred and ninety thou&s;and pounds, granted in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty nine; and al&s;o to con&s;ider &s;o much of the &s;aid act as related to the &s;ub&s;idy of poundage upon certain goods and marchandizes to be imported into this kingdom, and the additi|onal inland duty on coffee and chocolate. The committee having taken the&s;e points into delibe|ration, agreed to the two re&s;olutions we have al|ready mentioned, with re&s;pect to the con&s;olidation; and a bill was brought in for adding tho&s;e annui|ties granted in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-nine, to the joint &s;tock of three per cen|tum annuities, con&s;olidated by the acts of the twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirty &s;econd years of his maje&s;ty's reign; and for &s;everal duties therein mentioned, to the &s;inking fund.

He began with an a&s;&s;urance, that his maje&s;ty looked back on their proceedings with intire &s;atis|faction. He &s;aid, the duty and affection which they had expre&s;&s;ed for the king's per&s;on and govern|ment, the zeal and unanimity they had &s;hewed in maintaining the true intere&s;t of their country, could only be equalled by what his maje&s;ty had formerly experienced from this parliament. He told them it would have given his maje&s;ty the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, had he been able to a&s;&s;ure them that his endeavours to promote a general peace had met with more &s;uitable returns. He ob&s;erved that his ma|je&s;ty, in conjunction with his good brother and ally the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, had cho&s;en to give their ene|mies proofs of this equitable di&s;po&s;ition, in the mid&s;t of a &s;eries of glorious victories; an oppor|tunity the mo&s;t proper to take &s;uch a &s;tep with dig|nity, and to manife&s;t to all Europe the purity and moderation of his views. After &s;uch a conduct, he &s;aid, the king had the comfort to reflect, that the further continuance of the calamities of war could not be imputed to him or his allies; that he tru&s;ted in the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven upon the ju&s;tice of his arms, and upon tho&s;e ample means which the zeal of the parliament, in &s;o good a cau&s;e, had wi&s;ely put into his hands, that his future &s;ucce&s;&s;es in carrying on the war, would not fall &s;hort of the pa&s;t: and that, in the event, the public tranquility would be re&s;tored on &s;olid and durable foundations. He acquainted them that his maje&s;ty had taken
<PB N="351" REF="3750">
the mo&s;t effectual care to augment the combined<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> army in Germany; and at the &s;ame time to keep up &s;uch a force at home, as might fru&s;trate any at|tempts of the enemy to invade the&s;e kingdoms; &s;uch attempts as had hitherto ended only in their own confu&s;ion. He took notice that the royal navy was never in a more flouri&s;hing and re&s;pectable con|dition; and the &s;ignal victory obtained la&s;t winter over the French fleet, on their own coa&s;ts, had given lu&s;tre to his maje&s;ty's arms, fre&s;h &s;pirit to his maritime forces, and reduced the naval &s;trength of France to a very low ebb. He gave them to under&s;tand that his maje&s;ty had di&s;po&s;ed his &s;qua|drons in &s;uch a manner, as might be&s;t conduce to the annoyance of his enemies; to the defence of his own dominions, both in Europe and America; to the pre&s;erving and pur&s;uing his conque&s;ts, as well as to the protection of the trade of his &s;ub|jects, which he had extremely at heart. He told the commons, that nothing could relieve his ma|je&s;ty's royal mind, under the anxiety he felt for the burthens of his faithful &s;ubjects, but the public|&s;pirited chearfulne&s;s with which their hou&s;e had granted him &s;uch large &s;upplies, and his conviction that they were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity and e&s;&s;en|tial intere&s;ts of his kingdoms; he therefore returned them his hearty thanks for the&s;e &s;upplies, and a&s;|&s;ured them, they &s;hould be duly applied to the purpo&s;es for which they had been given. Finally, he recommended to both hou&s;es the continuance of that union and good harmony which he had ob|&s;erved with &s;o much plea&s;ure, and from which he had derived &s;uch important effects.

In the month of December in the preceding year, William Andrew Horne, a gentleman of &s;ome fortune in Derby&s;hire, was ex|ecuted at Nottingham, in the &s;eventy-fourth year of his age, for the murder of an infant born of his own &s;i&s;ter, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-four. On the third day after the birth, this brutal ru&s;&s;ian thru&s;t the child in a linen bag, and, accompanied by his own brother on hor&s;e|back, conveyed it to Anne&s;ley in Nottingham&s;hire, where it was next day found dead under a hay|&s;tack.
<PB N="353" REF="3770">
Though this cruel ru&s;tic knew how much<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> he lay at the mercy of his brother, whom he had made privy to this affair, far from endeavouring to engage his &s;ecrecy by offices of kindne&s;s and marks of affection, he treated him as an alien to his blood; not barely with indifference, but even with the mo&s;t barbarous rigour. He not only de|frauded him of his right, but exacted of him the lowe&s;t menial &s;ervices; beheld him &s;tarving in a cot|tage, while he lived him&s;elf in affluence; and refu&s;ed to relieve with a mor&s;el of charity, the children of his own brother begging at his gate. It was the re&s;entment of this pride and barbarity which, in all likelihood, fir&s;t impelled the other to revenge. He pretended qualms of con&s;cience, and di&s;clo&s;ed the tran&s;action of the child to &s;everal individuals As the brother was univer&s;ally hated for the in&s;olence and brutality of his di&s;po&s;ition, information was given again&s;t him, and a re&s;olution formed to bring him to condign puni&s;hment. Being informed of this de&s;ign, he tampered with his brother, and de&s;ired that he would retract, upon the trial, the evidence he had given before the ju&s;tice. Though the bro|ther rejected this &s;cheme of &s;ubornation, he of|fered to withdraw him&s;elf from the kingdom, if he might have five pounds to defray the expence of his removal. So &s;ordidly avaritious was the other, that he refu&s;ed to advance this mi&s;erable pittance, though he knew his own life depended upon his compliance. He was accordingly apprehended; tried, and convicted on his brother's evidence; and then he confe&s;&s;ed the particulars of his expo&s;ing the infant. He denied, indeed, that he had any thought the child would peri&s;h, and declared he intended

the public. The fir&s;t charge had alarmed the peo|ple<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> of England, jealous in honour, &s;udden and ra&s;h in their re&s;entments, and ob&s;tinately adhering to the prejudices they have e&s;pou&s;ed. The implied accu&s;ation in the orders of p&mdash;e F&mdash;d, and the combu&s;tible matter &s;uperadded by the pamph|let writer, kindled up &s;uch a blaze of indignation in the minds of the people, as admitted of no tem|perament or controul. An abhorrence and dete&s;ta|tion of l&mdash;d G&mdash;S&mdash;le, as a coward and a traitor, became the univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, which acted by contagion, infecting all degrees of people from the cottage to the t&mdash;; and no individual, who had the lea&s;t regard for his own character and quiet, would venture to preach up moderation, or even advi&s;e a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of belief, until more certain in|formation could be received. Fre&s;h fuel was con|tinually thrown in by ob&s;cure authors of pamphlets and news papers, who &s;tigmatized and in&s;ulted with &s;uch virulent per&s;everance, that one would have imagined they were actuated by per&s;onal mo|tives, not retained by mercenary book&s;ellers, again&s;t that unfortunate nobleman. Not &s;atisfied with inventing circum&s;tances to his di&s;honour, in his conduct on the la&s;t occa&s;ion, they pretended to take a retro&s;pective view of his character, and pro|duced a number of anecdotes to his prejudice, which had never before &s;een the light, and but for this occa&s;ion had probably never been known. Not that all the writings which appeared on this &s;ubject contained fre&s;h matter of aggravation again&s;t l&mdash;d G&mdash;S&mdash;le. Some writers, either animated by the hope of advantage, or hired to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His addre&s;s to the public.</NOTE> Such precisely was the &s;tate of the di&s;pute, when l&mdash;G&mdash;arrived in London. While p&mdash;F&mdash;d was crowned with laurel; while the k&mdash;of G&mdash;t B&mdash;n approved his conduct, and as the mo&s;t glorious mark of that approbation, inve&s;ted him with the order of the garter; while his name was celebrated through all England, and extoiled in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of hyperbole, above all the heroes of antiquity; every mouth was opened in execration of the late commander of the Briti&s;h troops in Germany. He was now made acquainted with the particulars of this imputed guilt, which he had before indi&s;t nctly learned. He was accu&s;ed of having di&s;obeyed three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive orders he had re|ceived from the general, during the action at Min|den, to advance with the cavalry of the right wing, which he commanded, and &s;u&s;tain the infantry that were engaged; and after the cavalry were put in moti|on, of having halted them unnece&s;&s;arily, and marched &s;o slow, that they could not reach the place of action in time to be of any &s;ervice; by which conduct the opportunity was lo&s;t of attacking the enemy when they gave way, and rendering the victory more glorious and deci&s;ive.

<P>The various reports that have been propagated to my di&s;advantage, and the many fal&s;hoods which have been a&s;&s;erted to ruin my character, lay me under the nece&s;&s;ity of remaining not entirely &s;i|lent, though I am debarred at pre&s;ent from &s;tating my ca&s;e to the public, as I &s;hould have done, had I not a&s;&s;u|rances of obtaining a court|martial for my trial, the only legal and effectual method of convincing the world how little foundation there has been for the torrent of calumny and abu&s;e, which has been &s;o ma|liciou&s;ly thrown out again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I had rather, upon this oc|ca&s;ion, &s;ubmit my&s;elf to all the inconveniencies that may ari&s;e from the want of &s;tile, than borrow a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the pens of others, as I can have no hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing my character, but from the force of truth. I &s;hall, there|fore, as plainly, and di&s;tinct|ly as po&s;&s;ible, relate a few cir|cum&s;tances, which will at lea&s;t &s;hew that nobody could be more de&s;irous than I was to bring truth to light, and &s;ub|ject my conduct to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I found by the implied cen&s;ure given out in orders the 2d of Augu&s;t, that my conduct had appeared in an unfavourable light to prince Ferdinand, on the day of ac|tion, I endeavoured to inform my&s;elf what particular I had either failed in or neglected my duty; I heard in general of di&s;obedience of orders, but I could fix no certain period of time to my &s;uppo&s;ed crime, till colonel Fitzroy acquainted me with what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween his &s;erene highne&s;s and him upon my &s;ubject, in re|gard to the orders delivered to me by him (colonel Fitz|roy) that day; whenever my trial comes, I &s;hall endeavour to clear up that point to the &s;atisfaction of the public: my own a&s;&s;ertions may have little weight, but the oaths of wit|ne&s;&s;es, who&s;e veracity cannot be called in que&s;tion, will, I tru&s;t, prove my innocence be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I immediately applied for his maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to return to England, that I might an|&s;wer anyaccu&s;ation that &s;hould be brought again&s;t me; for, as commander in chief of the Briti&s;h forces in Germany, no per&s;on there could order a court-martial for my trial, had there been an accu&s;ation
laid; the power of &s;ummon|ing courts martial and ap|proving their &s;entences, was ve&s;ted in me by my commi&s;|&s;ion, and no Briti&s;h officer or &s;oldier could be tried by any other authority.</P>

The ground from which the&s;e troops advanced was a kind of heath or plain, which opened a con&s;iderable way to the left, where the re&s;t of the army was formed in order of battle;

It was proved that immediately after the troops were put in motion, colonel Fitzroy arrived with an order from prince F&mdash;, importing that the Briti&s;h cavalry only &s;hould advance by the left; that lord G&mdash;declared their orders were contradictory, and &s;eemed the more puzzled, as he under&s;tood that both the&s;e gentlemen came off nearly at the &s;ame time from the prince, and were probably directed to communicate the &s;ame order. It was therefore natural to &s;uppo&s;e there was a mi&s;|take, as there might be danger in breaking the line, as the route by the wood appeared more difficult and tedious than that by the windmill, which led directly through open ground to the enemy; and as he could not think that if a body of hor&s;e was immediately wanted, the general would &s;end for the Briti&s;h, that were at the farthe&s;t extremity of the wing, rather than for the Hanoverian cavalry, who formed the left of the line, and con&s;equently were much nearer the &s;cene of action. It was proved that lord G&mdash;, in this uncertainty, re&s;olved to ap|ply for an explanation to the p&mdash;in per&s;on, who he under&s;tood was at a &s;mall di&s;tance; that with this view, he &s;et out with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; that having entered the wood, and perceived that the country beyond it opened &s;ooner to the left than he had imagined, and captain Smith, his aid du camp, advi&s;ing that the Briti&s;h cavalry &s;hould be

The time which elap&s;ed from the fir&s;t order he received by captain Winchingrode, to the arrival of colonel Ligonier, did not exceed eight minutes, during which his aid du camp, captain Hugo, was em|ployed in removing the Saxe Gotha regiment from the front, by which he propo&s;ed to advance. From that period till the cavalry actually marched, in con|&s;equence of an order from lord G&mdash;, the length of time was differently e&s;timated in the opinions of dif|ferent witne&s;&s;es, but, at a medium, computed by the judge-advocate at fifteen minutes, during which, the following circum&s;tances were tran&s;acted: the troops were fir&s;t ordered to advance forwards, then haited; the contradictory orders arrived and were di&s;puted; the commander de&s;ired the two aids du camp to agree about which was the preci&s;e order, and he would obey it immediately; each in&s;i&s;ting upon that which he had delivered, lord G&mdash;ha&s;tened to the ge|neral for an explanation; and as he pa&s;&s;ed the wood, &s;ent back captain Smith to the right of the cavalry, which was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, to put the Bri|ti&s;h hor&s;e in motion. We &s;hall not pretend to deter|mine whether the commander of &s;uch an important body may be excu&s;eable for he&s;itating, when he re|ceives contradictory orders at the &s;ame time, e&s;pe|cially when both orders run counter to his own judg|ment; whether in that ca&s;e it is allowable for him to &s;u&s;pend the operation for a few minutes, in order
<PB N="368" REF="3930">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to con&s;ult in per&s;on the commander in chief, about a &s;tep of &s;uch con&s;equence to the pre&s;ervation of the whole army. Neither will we venture to decide dog|matically on the merits of the march, after the ca|valry were put in motion; whether they marched too &s;low, or were unnece&s;&s;arily halted, in their way to the heath. It was proved indeed, that lord G&mdash;was always remarkably &s;low in his movements of cavalry, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that if hor&s;es are blown, they mu&s;t be unfit for &s;ervice, and that the lea&s;t hurry is apt to di&s;order the line of hor&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as would rob them of their proper effect, and render all their efforts abortive. This being the &s;y&s;tem of lord G&mdash;S&mdash;e, it may de|&s;erve con&s;ideration, whether he could deviate from it on this delicate occa&s;ion, without renouncing the dictates of his own judgment and di&s;cretion; and whether he was at liberty to u&s;e his own judgment, after having received the order to advance. After all, whether he was intentionally guilty, and what were the motives by which he was really actuated, are que&s;tions which his own con&s;cience alone can &s;olve. Even granting him to have he&s;itated from perplexity, to have lingered from vexation, to have failed through error of judgment, he will probably find favour with the candid and humane part of his fellow &s;ubjects, when they reflect upon the nature of his &s;ituation, placed at the head of &s;uch a body of cavalry, unin&s;tructed and uninform|ed of plan or circum&s;tance, divided from the re&s;t of the army, unacquainted with the operations of the day, chagrined with doubt and di&s;appointment, and perplexed by contradictory orders, neither of which he could execute without offering violence

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> knew him, given manifold proofs of in&s;anity, at length perpetrated a murder, which &s;ubjected him to the cognizance of ju&s;tice. His deportment to his lady was &s;o brutal, that application had been made to the hou&s;e of peers, and a &s;eparation effected by act of parliament. Tru&s;tees were nominated; and one Mr. John&s;on, who had, during the be&s;t part of his life, been employed in the family, was now appointed receiver of the e&s;tates, at the earl's own reque&s;t. The conduct of this man in the cour&s;e of his &s;teward&s;hip gave umbrage to lord Ferrers, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was equally jealous and vindictive. He imagined all his own family had con&s;pired again&s;t his intere&s;t, and that John&s;on was one of their accomplices; that he had been in|&s;trumental in obtaining the act of parliament, which his lor$&s;hip con&s;idered as a grievous hard&s;hip; that he had di&s;appointed him in regard to a certain con|tract about coal-mines; in a word, that there was a collu&s;ion between John&s;on and the earl's adver&s;a|ries. Fired with the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, he fir&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment by giving John&s;on notice to quit the farm which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the e&s;tate; but finding the tru&s;tees had confirmed the lea&s;e, he determined to gratify his revenge by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and laid his plan accordingly. On Sunday the thirteenth of January, he appointed this unhappy man to come to his hou&s;e, on the Friday following, in order to peru&s;e papers, or &s;ettle accompts; and John&s;on went thither, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of what was prepared for his reception: for although he was no &s;tranger to his lord&s;hip's dangerous di&s;|po&s;ition, and knew he had &s;ome time before incur|red his di&s;plea&s;ure, yet he imagined his re&s;entment

had intirely &s;ub&s;ided, as the earl had of late behaved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to him with remarkable complacency. He there|fore at the time appointed repaired to his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e of Stanton in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, at the di&s;tance of a &s;hort m$le from his own habitation, and was admitted by a maid &s;ervant. The earl had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed every per&s;on in the hou&s;e, upon various pretences, except three women who were left in the kitchen. John&s;on advancing to the door of the apartment, was received by his lord&s;hip, who de&s;ired him to walk into another room, where he joined him in a few minutes, and then the door was locked on the in&s;ide. After a great deal of warm expo&s;tulation, the earl in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;ub&s;$ribing a paper, ac|knowledging him&s;elf a villain; and on his refu&s;ing to comply with this demand, declared he would put him to death. In vain the unfortunate man re|mon&s;trated again&s;t this cruel inju&s;tice, and depre|cated the indignation of this furious nobleman. He remained deaf to all his intreaties, drew forth a pi&s;tol, which he had loaded for the purpo&s;e, and commanding him to implore heaven's mercy on his knees, &s;hot him through the body while he remained in that &s;upplicating attitude. The con|&s;equence of this violence was not immediate death; but his lord&s;hip &s;eeing the wretched victim &s;till alive and &s;en&s;ible, tho' agonized with pain, felt a momentary motion of pity. He ordered his &s;er|vants to convey Mr. John&s;on up-&s;tairs to a bed, to &s;end for a &s;u$geon, and give immediate notice of the accident to the wounded man's family. When Mr. John&s;on's daughter came to the hou&s;e, &s;he was met by the earl, who told her he had &s;hot her fa|ther on purpo&s;e, and with deliberation.</P>

When he demanded the &s;urgeon's opinion of the wound, the operator thought proper to temporize, for his own &s;afety, as well as for the &s;ake of the public, left the earl &s;hould take &s;ome other de&s;perate &s;tep, or endea|vour to e&s;cape. He therefore amu&s;ed him with hopes of John&s;on's recovery, about which he now &s;eemed extremely anxious. He &s;upported his &s;pirits by immoderate drinking, after having re|tired to another apartment with the &s;urgeon, whom he de&s;ired to take all po&s;&s;ible care of his patient. He declared, however, that he did not repent of what he had done; that John&s;on was a villain, who de&s;erved to die; that in ca&s;e of his death, he (the earl) would &s;urrender him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of peers, and take his trial. He &s;aid he could ju&s;tify the action to his own con&s;cience; and owned his intention was to have killed John&s;on outright; but as he &s;till &s;urvived, and was in pain, he de|&s;ired that all po&s;&s;ible means might be u&s;ed for his recovery. Nor did he &s;eem altogether neglectful of his own &s;afety: he endeavoured to tamper with the &s;urgeon, and &s;ugge&s;t what evidence he &s;hould give when called before a court of ju&s;tice. He continued to drink him&s;elf into a &s;tate of in|toxication, and all the cruelty of his hate &s;eemed to return. He would not allow the wounded man to be removed to his own hou&s;e, &s;aying, he would keep him under his own roof, that he might plague the villain. He returned to the chamber where John&s;on

After he retired to bed, the &s;urgeon procured a &s;ufficient number of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who conveyed Mr. John&s;on in an ea&s;y|chair to his own hou&s;e, where he expired that &s;ame morning, in great agonies. The &s;ame &s;urgeon a&s;|&s;embled a number of armed men to &s;eize the mur|derer, who at fir&s;t threatened re&s;i&s;tance, but was &s;oon apprehended, endeavouring to make his e&s;|cape, and committed to the county pri&s;on. From thence he was conveyed to London by the goaler of Leice&s;ter, and conducted by the u&s;her of the black rod and his deputy into the hou&s;e of lords, where the coroner's inque&s;t, and the affidavits touching the murder being read, the goaler deli|vered up his pri&s;oner to the care of the black rod, and he was immediately committed to the Tower. He appeared very calm, compo&s;ed, and uncon|cerned, from the time of his being apprehended; conver&s;ed cooly on the &s;ubject of his impri&s;onment; made very pertinent remarks upon the nature of the habeas corpus act of parliament, of which he hoped to avail him&s;elf; and when they withdrew from the hou&s;e of peers, de&s;ired he might not be vi&s;ited by any of his relations or acquaintances.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> offender to the ju&s;tice of his country. The lord-keeper Henley was appointed lord high &s;teward for the trial of earl Ferrers, and &s;at in &s;tate with all the peers and judges in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, which was for this purpo&s;e converted into a very augu&s;t tribunal. On the &s;ixteenth day of April the delin|quent was brought from the Tower in a coach, at|tended by the major of the Tower, the gentleman|gaoler, the wardours, and a detachment of the foot-guards. He was brought into court about ten; and the lord &s;teward with the peers taking their places, he was arraigned aloud, in the mid&s;t of an infinite concour&s;e of people, including many foreigners, who &s;eemed wonderfully &s;truck with the magnificence and &s;olemnity of the tribunal. The murder was fully proved by unque&s;tionable evidence: but the earl pleaded in&s;anity of mind; and, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h this plea, called many witne&s;&s;es to atte&s;t his lunacy in a variety of in|&s;tances, which &s;eemed too plainly to indicate a di&s;ordered imagination: unfounded jealou&s;y of plots and con&s;piracies, unconnected ravings, fits of mu&s;ing, incoherent ejaculations, &s;udden &s;tarts of fury, denunciations of unprovoked revenge, frantic ge&s;ticulations, and a &s;trange caprice of tem|per, were proved to have di&s;tingui&s;hed his conduct and deportment. It appeared, that lunacy had been a family taint, and affected divers of his lord&s;hip's relations; that a &s;ollicitor of reputation had renounced his bu&s;ine&s;s, on the full per&s;ua&s;ion of his being di&s;ordered in his brain; that, long before this unhappy event, his neare&s;t relations had deliberated upon the expediency of taking out a commi&s;&s;ion of lunacy again&s;t him, and were pre|vented

A phy&s;ician of eminence, who&s;e practice was con|fined to per&s;ons labouring under this infirmity, declared that the particulars of the earl's deport|ment, and per&s;onal behaviour, &s;eemed to indicate lunacy. Indeed, all his neighbours and acquain|tances had long con&s;idered him as a madman; and a certain noble l&mdash;declared in the h&mdash;of p&mdash;, when the bill of &s;eparation was on the carpet, that he looked upon him in the light of a maniac; and that, if &s;ome effectual &s;tep was not taken to dive&s;t him of the power of doing mi&s;chief, he did not doubt but that one day they &s;hould have occa|&s;ion to try him for murder. The lawyers, who managed the pro&s;ecution in behalf of the crown, endeavoured to invalidate the proofs of his lunacy, by ob&s;erving, that his lord&s;hip was never &s;o much deprived of his rea&s;on, but that he could di&s;tin|gui&s;h between good and evil; that the murder he had committed was the effect of revenge, for a conceived injury of &s;ome &s;tanding; that the ma|lice was deliberate, and the plan artfully con|ducted; that, immediately after the deed was per|petrated, the earl's conver&s;ation and rea&s;oning was cool and con&s;i&s;tent, until he drank him&s;elf into a &s;tate of intoxication; that, in the opinion of the greate&s;t lawyers, no criminal can avail him&s;elf of the plea of lunacy, provided the crime was com|mitted during a lucid interval: but his lord&s;hip,
<PB N="378" REF="4030">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> far from exhibiting any marks of in&s;anity, had, in the cour&s;e of this trial, di&s;played uncommon un|der&s;tanding and &s;$gac$ty in examining the wit|ne&s;&s;es, and making many &s;hrewd and pertinent ob&s;ervations on the evidence which was given. The&s;e &s;e$t ments were conformable to the opinion of the peers, who unanimou&s;ly declared him guil|ty. After all, in examining the vitious actions of a man, who has betrayed manife&s;t and manifold &s;ymptoms of in&s;anity, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which were committed during the lucid in|terval. The &s;ugge&s;tions of madne&s;s are often mo|mentary and tran&s;ient: the determinations of a lunatic, though generally ra&s;h and in&s;tantaneous, are &s;ometimes the re&s;ult of artful contrivance; but there is always an ab&s;urdity which is the criterion of the di&s;ea&s;e, either in the premi&s;es or conclu&s;ion. The earl, it is true, had formed a deliberate plan for the perpetration of the murder; but he had taken no precautions for his own &s;afety, or e&s;cape: and this neglect will the more plainly appear to have been the criterion of in&s;anity, if we reflect that he ju&s;t fied what he had done as a meritorious action; and declared he would, upon Mr. John|&s;on's death, &s;urrender him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of lords. Had he been impelled to this violence by a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, it could not be expected that he &s;hould have taken any mea&s;ures for his own pre|&s;ervation; but as it was the execution of a delibe|rate &s;cheme, and his lord&s;hip was by no means de|fective in point of ingenuity, he might ea&s;ily have contrived means for concealing the murder, until he &s;hould have accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape: and, in our opinion, any other than a madman would either

Neither do we think that the &s;anity of his mind was a&s;certained by the accuracy and deliberation with which he made his remarks, and examined the evidence at his trial. The influence of his frenzy might be pa&s;t; though it was no &s;ign of &s;ound rea&s;on to &s;upply the pro&s;ecutor with &s;uch an argument to his prejudice.

<P>The trial was continued for two days; and on the third the lord &s;teward, after having made a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convict|ed;</NOTE> &s;hort &s;peech touching the heinous nature of the of|fence, pronounced the &s;ame &s;entence of death upon the earl which malefactors of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s undergo; that from the Tower, in which he was impri&s;oned, he &s;hould, on the Monday following, be led to the common place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck, and his body be afterwards di&s;&s;ected and anatomized. This la&s;t part of the &s;entence &s;eemed to &s;hock the criminal extremely: he changed colour, his jaw quivered, and he ap|peared to be in great agitation; but during the remaining part of his life he behaved with &s;ur|pri&s;ing compo&s;ure, and even unconcern. After he had received &s;entence, the lords his judges, by virtue of a power ve&s;ted in them, re&s;pited his exe|cution for one month, that he might have time to &s;ettle his temporal and &s;piritual concerns. Before &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed, the earl read a paper, in which

He was guarded by a po&s;&s;e of con&s;tables, a party of hor&s;e&punc;grenadiers, and a

detachment of infantry; and in this manner the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> proce&s;&s;ion moved from the Tower, through an in|finite concour&s;e of people, to Tyburn, where the gallows, and a &s;caffold erected under it, appeared covered with black bays. The earl behaved with great compo&s;ure to Mr. &s;heriff Vaillant, who at|tended him in the landau: he ob&s;erved, that the gaiety of his apparel might &s;eem odd on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but that he had particular rea&s;ons for wearing that &s;uit of cloaths: he took notice of the va&s;t multitude which crouded around him, brought thither, he &s;uppo&s;ed, by curio&s;ity to &s;ee a nobleman hanged: he told the &s;heriff he had applied to the king, by letter, that he might be permitted to die in the Tower, where the earl of E&s;&s;ex, one of his ance&s;tors, had been beheaded in the reign of queen Elizabeth; an application which, he &s;aid, he had made with the more confidence, as he had the ho|nour to quarter part of his maje&s;ty's arms. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure at being executed as a common felon, expo&s;ed to the eyes of &s;uch a mul|titude. The chaplain, who had never been ad|mitted to him before, hinting that &s;ome account of his lord&s;hip's &s;entiments on religion would be ex|pected by the public, he made an&s;wer, that he did not think him&s;elf accountable to the public for his private &s;entiments; that he had always adored one God, the creator of the univer&s;e; and, with re|&s;pect to any particular opinions of his own, he had never propagated them, or endeavoured to make pro&s;elytes; becau&s;e he thought it was criminal to di&s;turb the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of his country, as lord B&mdash;had done by the publication of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> his writings. He added, that the great number of &s;ects, and the multiplication of religious di&s;putes, had almo&s;t bani&s;hed morality. With regard to the crime for which he &s;uffered, he declared that he had no malice again&s;t Mr. John&s;on; and that the murder was owing to a perturbation of mind, oc|ca&s;ioned by a variety of cro&s;&s;es and vexations. When he approached the place of execution, he expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee and take leave of a certain per&s;on who waited in a coach; a per&s;on for whom he entertained the mo&s;t &s;incere regard and affection: but the &s;heriff prudently ob&s;erving that &s;uch an interview might &s;hock him, at a time when he had occa&s;ion for all his fortitude and re|collection, he acquie&s;ced in the ju&s;tne&s;s of the re|mark, and delivered to him a pocket-book, a ring, and a pur&s;e, de&s;iring they might be given to that per&s;on, whom he now declined &s;eeing. On his ar|rival at Tyburn he came out of the landau, and a&s;cended the &s;caffold with a firm &s;tep and undaunted countenance. He refu&s;ed to join the chaplain in his devotions; but, kneeling with him on black cu&s;hions, he repeated the Lord's Prayer, which he &s;aid he had always admired; and added, with great energy, "O Lord, forgive me all my errors, par|don all my &s;ins." After this exerci&s;e, he pre&s;ented his watch to Mr. &s;heriff Vaillant, thanked him and the other gentleman for all their civilities; and &s;ignified his de&s;ire of being buried at Breden, or Stanton, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. Finally, he grati|fied the executioner with a pur&s;e of money: then the halter being adju&s;ted to his neck, he &s;tepped upon a little &s;tage, erected upon &s;prings, on the

middle of the &s;caffold; and, the cap being pulled<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> over his eyes, the &s;heriff made a &s;ignal, at which the &s;tage fell from under his feet, and he was left &s;u&s;pended. His body, having hung an hour and five minutes, was cut down, placed in the hear&s;e, and conveyed to the public theatre for di&s;&s;ection, where being opened, and lying for &s;ome days as the &s;ubject of a public lecture, at length it was car|ried off, and privately interred.</P>
<P>Without all doubt, this unhappy nobleman's di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o dangerou&s;ly mi&s;chievous, that it became nece&s;&s;ary, for the good of &s;ociety, either to confine him for life, as an incorrigible lunatic, or give him up at once as a &s;acrifice to ju&s;tice. Per|haps it might be no ab&s;urd nor unrea&s;onable regu|lation in the legi&s;lature, to dive&s;t all lunatics of the privilege of in&s;anity, and, in ca&s;es of enormity, &s;ubject them to the common penalties of the law; for though, in the eye of ca&s;ui&s;try, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t enter into the con&s;titution of guilt, the con|&s;equences of murder, committed by a maniac, may be as pernicious to &s;ociety as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t cri|minal and deliberate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: and the puni&s;h|ment of death can be hardly deemed unju&s;t, or ri|gorous, when inflicted upon a mi&s;chievous being, dive&s;ted of all the perceptions of rea&s;on and huma|nity. At any rate, as the nobility of England are rai&s;ed by many illu&s;trious di&s;tinctions above the level of plebeians, and as they are eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed from them in &s;uffering puni&s;hment for high trea&s;on, which the law con&s;iders as the mo&s;t atrocious crime that can be committed, it might not be unworthy of the notice of the legi&s;lature to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion by one Stirn a He&s;&s;ian.</NOTE> Hornicide is the reproach of England: one would imagine there is &s;omething in the climate of this country, that not only di&s;po&s;es the natives to this inhuman outrage, but even infects foreigners who re&s;ide among them. Certain it is, high pa&s;|&s;ions will break out into the mo&s;t enormous vio|lences, in that country where they are lea&s;t con|trouled by the re&s;traint of regulation and di&s;ci|pline; and it is equally certain, that in no civi|lized country under the &s;un, there is &s;uch a relaxa|tion of di&s;cipline, either religious or civil, as in England. The month of Augu&s;t produced a re|markable in&s;tance of de&s;perate revenge, perpe|trated by one Stirn, a native of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, in|flamed and exa&s;perated by a fal&s;e punctilio of ho|nour. This unhappy young man was de&s;cended of a good family, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many accompli&s;h|ments both of mind and per&s;on: but his character was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch a jealous &s;en&s;ibility, as ren|dered him unhappy in him&s;elf, and di&s;agreeable to his acquaintance. After having for &s;ome years performed the office of u&s;her in a boarding-&s;chool,
<PB N="385" REF="4100">
he was admitted to the hou&s;e of one Mr. Mat|thews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> a &s;urgeon, in order to teach him the cla&s;&s;ics, and in&s;truct his children in mu&s;ic, which he per|fectly under&s;tood. He had not long re&s;ided in this family, when the &s;urgeon took umbrage at &s;ome part of his conduct, taxed him roughly with fraud and ingratitude, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his re|moving to another lodging. Whether he rejected this intimation, or found difficulty in procuring another apartment, the &s;urgeon re&s;olved to expel him by violence, called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a peace|officer, and turned him out into the &s;treet in the night, after having loaded him with the mo&s;t pro|voking reproaches. The&s;e injuries and di&s;graces operating upon a mind jealous by nature, and gal|led by adver&s;ity, produced a kind of phrenzy of re&s;entment; and he took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of &s;acrificing Matthews to his revenge. Next day, having provided a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and charged them for the occa&s;ion, he reinforced his rage by drinking an unu&s;ual quantity of wine, and repaired in the evening to a public hou&s;e which Mr. Mat|thews frequented, in the neighbourhood of Hat|ton-Garden. There he accordingly found the un|happy victim &s;itting with &s;ome of his friends; and the &s;urgeon, in&s;tead of palliating his former conduct, began to in&s;ult him afre&s;h with the mo&s;t oppro|brious invectives. Stirn, exa&s;perated by this ad|ditional indignity, pulled his pi&s;tols from his bo|&s;om, &s;hot the &s;urgeon, who immediately expired, and di&s;charged the other at his own brea&s;t, though his confu&s;ion was &s;uch that it did not take effect. He was apprehended on the &s;pot, and conveyed to
<PB N="386" REF="4110">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> pri&s;on, where, for &s;ome days, he refu&s;ed all kind of &s;u&s;tenance, but afterwards became more com|po&s;ed. At his trial he pleaded in&s;anity of mind; but being found guilty, he re&s;olved to anticipate the execution of the &s;entence. That &s;ame even|ing he drank poi&s;on; and notwith&s;tanding all the remedies that could be admini&s;tered, died in &s;trong convul&s;ions. His body was publicly di&s;&s;ected, according to the &s;entence of the law, and after|wards interred with tho&s;e marks of indignity which are re&s;erved for the perpetrators of &s;ui|cide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A lady murdered by her coach|man.</NOTE> The &s;ame period was di&s;tingui&s;hed by another a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination equally &s;hocking, and much more de|liberate.

Of the&s;e capital &s;hips &s;eventeen were &s;tationed in the Ea&s;t Indies, twenty for the defence of the We&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, twelve in North America, ten in the Mediterranean, and &s;ixty-one, either on the coa&s;t of France, in the harbours of England, or crui&s;ing in the Engli&s;h &s;eas for the protection of the Briti&s;h commerce.

H s in&s;tructions were to make occa&s;ional de&s;cents upon the coa&s;t of Ireland, and, by dividing the troops, and di&s;tracting the at|tention of the government in that kingdom, to fa|cilitate the enterprize of Mr. de Conflans, the fate of which we have already narrated. The original armament of Thurot con&s;i&s;ted of five &s;hips, one of which, called the Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le, was mounted with forty-four guns; the Begon, the

The &s;everity of the wea|ther detained them nineteen days at Bergen, at the expiration of which they &s;et &s;ail for the we&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland, and di&s;covered the northern part of Ireland in the latter end of January. The intention of Thurot was to make a de&s;cent about Derry; but before this de&s;ign could be executed, the weather growing tempe&s;tuous, and the wind blowing off &s;hore, they were driven out to &s;ea, and, in the night, lo&s;t &s;ight of the Marante, which never joined them in the &s;equel. After having been tempe&s;t-beaten for &s;ome time, and expo&s;ed to a very &s;canty allowance of provi&s;ion, the officers re|que&s;ted of Thurot, that he would return to France, le&s;t they &s;hould all peri&s;h by famine, but he lent a deaf ear to this propo&s;al, and frankly told them he could not return to France, without having &s;truck &s;ome &s;troke for the &s;ervice of his country.

The weather no &s;ooner permitted Thurot to pur&s;ue his de&s;tination, than he &s;ailed from I&s;la to the bay of Carrickfergus in Ireland, and made all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations for a de&s;cent; which was ac|cordingly effected, with &s;ix hundred men, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of February. Lieutenant colonel Jennings, who commanded four companies of raw undi&s;ciplined men at Carrickfergus, having re|ceived information that three &s;hips had anchored about two miles and a half from the ca&s;tle, which was ruinous and defencele&s;s, immediately detached a party to make ob&s;ervations, and ordered the French pri&s;oners there confined to be removed to Belfa&s;t. Mean while, the enemy landing without oppo&s;ition, advanced towards the town, which they found as well guarded as the nature of the place, which was intirely open, and the circum&s;tances of the Engli&s;h commander, would allow. A regular attack was carried on, and a &s;pirited defence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One circum&s;tance that attended this di&s;pute, de&s;erves to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, as an in&s;tance of that cou|rage, mingled with humani|ty, which con&s;titutes true he|roi&s;m. While the French and Engli&s;h were hotly engaged in one of the &s;treets, a little child ran playfully between them, having no idea of the danger to which it was ex|po&s;ed: a common &s;oldier of the enemy, perceiving the life of this poor innocent at &s;take, grounded his piece, advanced deliberately between the lines of fire, took up the child in his arms, conveyed it to a place of &s;afety; then re|turning to his place, re&s;umed his mu&s;ket, and renewed his ho&s;tility.</NOTE>

Neverthele&s;s, they repul&s;ed the a&s;|&s;ailants in their fir&s;t attack, even after the gate was bur&s;t open, and &s;upplied the want of &s;hot with &s;tones and rubbi&s;h. At length, the colonel and his troops were obliged to &s;urrender, on condition that they &s;hould not be &s;ent pri&s;oners to France, but be ran&s;omed by &s;ending thither an equal num|ber of French pri&s;oners from Great Britain or Ire|land; that the ca&s;tle &s;hould not be demoli&s;hed, nor the town of Carrickfergus plundered or burned, on condition that the mayor and corporation &s;hould furni&s;h the French troops with nece&s;&s;ary provi|&s;ions. The enemy, after this exploit, did not pre|&s;ume to advance farther into the country; a &s;tep which indeed they could not have taken, with any regard to their own &s;afety: for by this time a con|&s;iderable body of regular troops was a&s;&s;embled; and the people of the country manife&s;ted a lau|dable &s;pirit of loyalty and re&s;olution, crowding in great numbers to Belfa&s;t, to offer their &s;ervice again&s;t the invaders.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He him|&s;elf is &s;lain, and his &s;hips are taken.</NOTE> The fate they e&s;caped on &s;hore, they &s;oon met with at &s;ea. Captain John Elliot, who commanded three frigates at Kin&s;ale, and had in the cour&s;e of this war more than once already di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf, even in his early youth, by extraordinary acts of valour, was informed by a di&s;patch from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, that three of the enemy's &s;hips lay at anchor in the bay of Carrickfergus, and thither he immediately &s;haped his cour&s;e in the &s;hip Aeolus, accompanied by the Pallas and Brilliant, under the command of the captains Clements and Logie. On the twenty-eighth day of February they de&s;cried the enemy, and gave chace, in &s;ight of the I&s;le of Man; and about nine in the morning captain Elliot, in his own &s;hip, engaged the Bellei&s;le, commanded by Thurot, altho' con&s;iderably his &s;uperior in &s;trength of men, number of guns, and weight of metal. In a few minutes his con&s;orts were al&s;o engaged with the other two &s;hips of the enemy. After a warm action maintained with great &s;pirit on all &s;ides for an hour and a half, captain Elliot's lieutenant boarded the Bellei&s;le, and, &s;triking her colours with his own hand, the commander &s;ubmitted: his ex|ample was immediately followed by the other French captains, and the Engli&s;h commodore, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prizes, conveyed them into the bay of Ram&s;ay in the I&s;le of Man, that their damage might be repaired. Though the Bellei&s;le was very leaky, and had lo&s;t her bolt&s;prit, mizen|ma&s;t, and main-yard, in all probability the victory

The victor had not even the con&s;olation to perform the la&s;t offices to his brave enemy; for his body was thrown into the &s;ea by his own people in the hurry of the engagement. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h did not exceed forty men killed and wounded; whereas above three hundred of the enemy were &s;lain or di&s;abled. The &s;ervice per|formed on this occa&s;ion was deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the peace and commerce of Ireland, that the thanks of the hou&s;e of commons in that kingdom were voted to the conquerors of Thu$ot, as well as to lieutenant&punc;colonel Jennings for his &s;pirited beha|viour at Carrick&s;ergus; and the freedom of the city of Cork was pre&s;ented in &s;ilver boxes to the cap|tains Elliot, Clements, and Logie. The name of Thurot was become terrible to all the trading &s;ea|ports of Britain and Ireland; and therefore the defeat and capture of his &s;quadron were celebrated with as hearty rejoicings, as the mo&s;t important victory could have produced.</P>

The&s;e &s;tout Hibernians immediately formed a plan of in&s;urrection, and executed it with &s;ucce&s;s. Four of the French mariners being below deck, three aloft among the rigging, one at the helm, and another walking the deck, Brian, who headed the enterprize, tripped up the heels of the French &s;teer&s;man, &s;eized his pi&s;tol, and di&s;charged it at him who walked the deck; but mi&s;&s;ing the mark, he knocked him down with the butt end of the piece.

On the &s;ixteenth day of February, two Indian women appearing at Keowee, on the other &s;ide of the river, Mr. Dogharty, one of the of|ficers of the fort, went out to a&s;k them what news. While he has engaged in conver&s;a|tion with the&s;e females, the great Indian warrior Oucon|no&s;tata joining them, de&s;ired he would call the command|ing officer, to whom he &s;aid he had &s;omething to propo&s;e. Accordingly lieutenant Coty|more appearing, accompa|nied by en&s;ign Bell, Doghar|ty, and For&s;ter the interpre|ter&punc; Ouconno&s;tata told him he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to impart to the governor, whom he purpo&s;ed to vi&s;it, and de&s;ired he might be at|tended by a white man, as a &s;afeguard. The lieutenant a&s;&s;uring him he &s;hould have a &s;afeguard, the Indian declared he would then go and catch a hor&s;e for him; &s;o &s;aying, he &s;wung a b$i$le thrice over his head, as a &s;ignal, and imme|diately twenty-five or thirty mu&s;kets, from different am|bu&s;cades, were di&s;charged at the Engli&s;h officers. Mr. Co|tymore received a &s;hot in his left brea&s;t, and in a few days expired; Mr. Bell was wound|ed in the calf of the leg, and the interpreter in the but|tock. En&s;ign Milne, who re|mained in the fort, was $o &s;ooner informed of this trea|chery, than he ordered the &s;oldiers to &s;hackle the ho&s;|tages; in the execution of which order one man was killed upon the &s;pot, and another wounded in the fore|head with a tomahawk: cir|cum&s;tances which added to the murder of the lieutenant, incen&s;ed the garri&s;on to &s;uch a degree, that it was judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put the ho&s;tages to death without further he&s;itation. In the evening a party of Indians approaching the fort, and firing two &s;ignal pieces, cri$d aloud in the Cherokee lan|guage, "Fight manfully&punc; and you &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted." Then they began an attack, and continued firing all night upon the fort, without doing the lea&s;t execution. That a de&s;ign was concerted between them and the ho&s;tages, ap|peared plainly from the na|ture of this a&s;&s;ault; and this &s;uppo&s;ition was converted in|to a certainty next day, when &s;ome of the garri&s;on &s;earching the apartment in which the ho&s;tages lay, &s;ound a bottle of poi&s;on, probably de&s;igned to be emptied into the well, and &s;everal tomohawks bu|ried in the earth; which wea|pons had been privately con|veyed to them by their friends, who were permitted to vi&s;it them without inter|ruption. On the third day of March, the fort at Ninety-Six was attacked by two hun|dred Cherokee Indians, with mu&s;quetry, which had little or no effect, &s;o that they were forced to retire with &s;ome lo&s;s, and revenged them&s;elves on the open country, burning and ravaging all the hou&s;es and plantations belonging to Engli&s;h &s;ettlers in this part of the country, and all along the frontiers of Virginia. Not contented with pillaging and de&s;troying the habita|tions, they wantoned in the mo&s;t horrible barbarities; and their motions were &s;o &s;e|cret and &s;udden, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants to know where the &s;torm would bur&s;t, or take proper precautions for their own de|fence, &s;o that a great number of the back &s;ettlements were totally abandoned.</NOTE>.
<PB N="403" REF="4280">
Thus di&s;appointed, they wreaked their vengeance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> upon the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects trading in their country, all of whom they butchered without mercy.

He forthwith detached twelve hundred cho&s;en men to South Carolina, under the com|mand of colonel Montgomery, brother to the earl of Eglinton, an officer of approved conduct, and di&s;tingui&s;hed gallantry. Immediately after his ar|rival at Charles-Town, he advanced to Ninety-&s;ix, and proceeded to Twelve-Mile River, which he pa&s;&s;ed in the beginning of June, without oppo&s;i|tion. He continued his route, by forced marches, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of the In|dian town called Little Keowee, where he en|camped in an advantageous &s;ituation.

With this view, leaving his tents &s;tanding, with a &s;ufficient guard for the camp and waggons, he marched through the woods towards the Cherokee town of E&s;tatoe, at the di&s;|tance of five and twenty miles; and in his route detached a company of light infantry to de&s;troy the village of Little Keowee, where they were re|ceived with a &s;mart fire; but they ru&s;hed in with their bayonets, and all the men were put to the &s;word.

Some few of the Indians, who had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> not time to e&s;cape, were &s;lain; and the town, con|&s;i&s;ting of two hundred hou&s;es, well &s;tored with pro|vi&s;ion, ammunition, and all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, was fir&s;t plundered, and then reduced to a&s;hes; &s;ome of the wretched inhabitants, who concealed them&s;elves, peri&s;hing in the flames. It was nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;trike a terror into tho&s;e &s;avages by &s;ome examples of &s;everity; and the &s;oldiers became deaf to all the &s;ugge&s;tions of mercy, when they found in one of the Indian towns the body of an Engli&s;h|man, whom they had put to the torture that very morning. Colonel Montgomery followed his blow with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. In the &s;pace of a few hours he de&s;troyed Sugar-town, which was as large as E&s;tatoe, and every village and hou&s;e in the lower nation. The Indian villages in this part of the world were agreeably &s;ituated, generally con&s;i&s;ting of about one hundred hou&s;es, neatly and commo|diou&s;ly built, and well &s;upplied with provi&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quebec b$&s;ieged.</NOTE> Mr. Murray, far from being di&s;pirited by his defeat, no &s;ooner retired within the walls of Que|bec, than he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the fortifications of the place, which had been interrupted by the &s;everity of the winter; and the &s;oldiers exerted them&s;elves with incredible alacrity, not only in la|bouring at the works, but al&s;o in the defence of the town, before which the enemy had opened trenches on the very evening of the battle. Three &s;hips anchored at the foulon below their camp; and for &s;everal days they were employed in landing their cannon, mortars, and ammunition. Mean while they worked ince&s;&s;antly at their trenches be|fore the town; and, on the eleventh day of May, opened one bomb battery, and three batteries of cannon. Brigadier Murray made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po|&s;itions to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity: he rai&s;ed two cavaliers, contrived &s;ome outworks, and planted the ramparts with one hundred and thirty-two pieces of artillery, dragged thither mo&s;tly by the &s;oldiery. Though the enemy cannonaded the place with great vivacity the fir&s;t day, their fire

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Lord Colvi$le had &s;ailed from Halifax, with the fleet under his command, on the twenty-&s;econd day of April; but was retarded in his pa&s;&s;age by thick fogs, contrary winds, and great &s;hoals of ice floating down the river. Commodore Swanton, who had &s;ailed from England with a &s;mall rein|forcement, arrived about the beginning of May at the i&s;le of Bec, in the river St. Laurence, where, with two &s;hips, he purpo&s;ed to wait for the re&s;t of his &s;quad$on, which had &s;eparated from him in the pa&s;&s;age: but one of the&s;e, the Lowe&s;toffe, com|manded by captain Deane, had entered the harbour of Quebec on the ninth day of May, and commu|nicated to the governor the joyful news that the &s;quadron was arrived in the river. Commodore Swanton no &s;ooner received intimation that Que|bec was be&s;ieged, than he &s;ailed up the river with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and on the fifteenth in the evening anchored above Point Levi. The briga|dier expre&s;&s;ing an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that the French &s;quadron above the town might be removed, the commodore ordered captain Schomberg of the Dia|ra and captain Deane of the Lowe&s;toffe, to &s;l$p their cables early next morning, and attack the enemy's fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of two frigates, two armed &s;hips, and a good number of &s;maller ve&s;|&s;els. They were no &s;ooner in motion than the French &s;hips fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. One&punc; of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They a|bandon the &s;ei$e with pre|cipita|tion.</NOTE> The enemy were &s;o confounded and di&s;pirited by this di&s;a&s;ter, and the certain information that a &s;trong Engli&s;h &s;leet was already in the river of St. Laurence, that in the following night they rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Quebec, and retreated with great precipitation, leaving their provi&s;ions, implements, and artillery, to governor Murray, who had in|tended to make a vigorous &s;ally in the morning, and attempt to penetrate into the camp of the be|&s;iegers, which, from the information of pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, he conceived to be a very practicable &s;cheme.

He in&s;tantly marched out of Que$ c at the head of his forces, in hope of overtaking, and making an impre&s;&s;ion on their rear, that he might have ample revenge for his late di&s;comfiture; but they had pa&s;&s;ed the river Caprouge before he could come up with their army; however, he took &s;ome pri&s;oners, and a great quantity of baggage, including their tents, &s;tores, magazines of provi&s;ion and ammunition, with thirty-four pieces of battering cannon, ten field-pieces, &s;ix mortars, four petards, a great number of &s;caling ladders, intrenching to ls, and every other implement of a &s;iege.

<P>His maje&s;ty, who is by this time, probably, informed of your brilliant victory, will be no lo&s;s plea&s;ed with this, th$$ affected with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the colony; &s;o that &s;uppo&s;ing that a peace has not been concluded, on the receipt of this news, the king of Eng+land cannot po&s;&s;ibly avoid &s;ub&s;cribing &s;uch terms as ou$ monarch &s;hall have impo&s;$$ upon him.</P>
<P>You are not uninformed o$ the great advantages which he gained in Europe during the la&s;t campaign, over the Engli&s;h and Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners which a$ bringing in every moment, a agree in confirming them.</P>
<P>The truth is, his maje&s;t is in per&s;on in Holland, with an army of 200,000 men, the prince of Conti in Ger|many with 100,000, and the princes of Deux Ponts and Soubi&s;e command the army of the empire of 200,000; and la&s;tly, the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, and the queen of Hun|gary, have joined their whole force, and were taking mea|&s;ures for the conque&s;t of the remainder of his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty's dominions.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the la&s;t ac|counts a&s;&s;ure us, that the garri&s;ons of fort Frederick, Niagara, and Chouagan, have &s;uffered greatly by a &s;ickne&s;s, which is not yet &s;topped, and that the regular troops in New England are reduced to nothing.</P>
<P>General Murray therefore has di&s;per&s;ed manife&s;toes to no purpo&s;e, to magnify his own nation, to pacify the Ca|nadians, to engage them to lay down their arms, to di&s;|credit our bills of exchange, and our currency, at the &s;ame time that the Engli&s;h traders are eager to procure them, becau&s;e they have been regu|larly paid.</P>
<P>You &s;ee&punc; Sir, that the co|lony is drawing to the end of its hard&s;hips and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and that it is upon the $word$ of &s;eeing plenty &s;ucceed to &s;carcity.</P>
<P>If the Engli&s;h make any at|tempt, it can have no other object than the ambition of their generals; we are tho|roughly prepared to repul&s;e them with &s;pirit: we have a train of artillery, be&s;ides that which we took from the ene|my; a &s;till greater propor|tion of powder, ball, and am|munition, for the operations which I have projected: we have al&s;o provi&s;ions enough, by means of the re&s;ources which we &s;hall find in the good-will of the Canadians, who have the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of their religion and liberty. The king's troops will even live, if nece&s;&s;ary, upon roots, when they cannot do better, and will not fail to join their en|deavours to tho&s;e of the brave Canadians.</P>
<P>My intention then is&punc; that you and all your militia, &s;hould hold your&s;elves ready to march with arms, baggage, and eight days provi&s;ions, to our frontiers, when the ca&s;e &s;hall require it.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> for the pre&s;ervation of the colony, even tho' very little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s remained. His hopes, &s;lender as they were, depended upon the natural &s;trength of the country, rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by woods, mountains, and mora&s;&s;es, which might have retarded the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h, and protracted the war, until a general pacification could be effected. In the mean time, major general Amher&s;t was diligently employed in taking mea&s;ures for the execution of the plan he had projected, in order to complete the conque&s;t of Canada. He conveyed in&s;tructions to general Murray, directing him to advance by water towards Montreal, with all the troops that could be &s;pared from the garri&s;on of Quebec. He detached colonel Haviland with a body of troops from Crown point to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;le aux Noix, in the lake-Champlain, and from thence penetrate the &s;hort|e&s;t way to the bank of the river St. Laurence; while he him&s;elf, with the main body of the army, amounting to above ten thou&s;and men, including Indians, &s;hould proceed from the frontiers of New York, by the rivers of the Mohawks and Oneidas, to the lake Ontario&punc; and &s;ail down the river St. Laurence to the i&s;la$d Montreal. Thus, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that all the&s;e particulars could be
<PB N="423" REF="4480">
executed, the enemy mu&s;t have been at la&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> hemmed in, and intirely &s;urrounded. In pur|&s;uance of this plan, general Amher&s;t had provided two armed &s;loops to crui&s;e in the lake Ontario, un|der the command of captain Loring; as well as a great number of batteaus, or &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, for the tran&s;portation of the troops, artillery, ammu|nition, implements, and baggage. Several regi|ments were ordered to proceed from Albany to O&s;wego; and the general, taking his departure from Schenectady, with the re&s;t of the forces, in the latter end of June, arrived at the &s;ame place on the ninth day of July.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He fails down the St. Lau|rence, and re|duces the French fort at i&s;le Royale.</NOTE> Being informed that two French ve&s;&s;els had ap|peared off O&s;wego, he di&s;patched &s;ome batteaus to Niagara with intelligence to captain Loring, who immediately &s;et &s;ail in que&s;t of them; but they e&s;caped his pur&s;uit, though they had twice ap|peared in the neighbourhood of O&s;wego &s;ince the arrival of the general, who endeavoured to amu&s;e them by detaching batteaus to different parts of the lake. The army being a&s;&s;embled, and joined by a con&s;iderable body of Indians under the com|mand of Sir William John&s;on, the general detached colonel Haldemand with the light infantry, the grenadiers, and one battalion of highlanders, to take po&s;t at the bottom of the lake, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the armed ve&s;&s;els in finding a pa&s;&s;age to Le Galette. On the tenth day of Augu&s;t the army embarked on board the batteaus and whale boats, and pro|ceeded on the lake towards the mouth of the river St. Laurence. Under&s;tanding that one of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els had run a&punc;ground and was di&s;abled,
<PB N="4$4" REF="4490">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> and that the other lay off La Galette, he re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of his way down the river to Swegatchie, and attack the French fort at I&s;le Royale, one of the mo&s;t important po&s;ts on the river St. Laurence, the &s;ource of which it in a great mea&s;ure commands. On the &s;eventeenth the row|gallies fell in with the French &s;loop commanded by Mr. de la Broquerie, who &s;urrendered after a warm engagement. Mr. Amher&s;t having detached &s;ome en|gineers to reconnoitre the coa&s;ts and i&s;lands in the neighbourhood of I&s;le Royale, he made a di&s;po&s;i|tion for the attack of that fortre&s;s, which was ac|cording inve&s;ted, after he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands. Some of the&s;e the enemy had aban|doned with &s;uch precipitation, as to leave behind a few &s;calps they had taken on the Mohawk river, a number of tools and uten&s;ils, two &s;wivels, &s;ome barrels of pitch, and a large quantity of iron. The Indians were &s;o incen&s;ed at &s;ight of the &s;calps, that they burned a chapel, and all the hou&s;es of the ene|my. Batteries being rai&s;ed on the neare&s;t i&s;lands, the fort was cannonaded not only by them, but likewi&s;e by the armed &s;loops; and a di&s;po&s;ition was made for giving the a&s;&s;ault, when Mr. Pouchaut the governor thought proper to beat a parley, and &s;urrender on capitulation. The general, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort, found it &s;o well &s;ituated for commanding the lake Ontario, and the Mo|hawk river, that he re&s;olved to maintain it with a garri&s;on, and employed &s;ome days in repairing the fortifications.</P>
<P>From this place his navigation down the river St. Laurence was rendered extremely difficult and

dangerous, by a great number of violent riffs, or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> rapides, and falls; among which he lo&s;t above four&s;core men, forty-&s;ix batteaus, &s;eventeen whale-boats, one row-galley, with &s;ome artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition. On the &s;ixth day of September the troops were landed on the i&s;land of Montreal <NOTE PLACE="marg">He lands on the i&s;land of Mont|real.</NOTE> without any oppo&s;ition, except from &s;ome flying parties, which exchanged a few &s;hot, and then fled with precipitation. That &s;ame day he repaired a bridge which they had broke down in their retreat, and, after a march of two leagues, formed his army on a plain before Montreal, where they lay all night on their arms. Montreal is, in point of im|portance, the &s;econd place in Canada, &s;ituated in an i&s;land of the river St. Laurence, at an equal di&s;tance from Quebec and the lake Ontario. Its central &s;ituation rendered it the &s;taple of the Indian trade; yet the fortifications of it were incon|&s;iderable, not at all adequate to the value of the place.</P>

Con&s;cious of the injury we have done that gentleman, by blending him with &s;uch unpopular &s;ociety, we think it our duty to declare, upon better information, that al|derman Hea$hcote, far from being a parti&s;an of any mini&s;try, always di&s;tingui&s;hed h m&s;elf in par|liament by a con&s;tant and uniform oppo&s;ition to a l mini&s;terial mea&s;ures, which tended to the pre|judice or di&s;honour of the nation; and ever ap|proved him&s;elf an hone&s;t, re&s;olute, and zealous a&s;|&s;$rtor of the rights and liberties of the people. Indeed, his independency of &s;pirit, his integrity, ability, and love for his country, could not have a more honourable and convincing te&s;timonial than the warm, affectionate, and ample acknowledg|ment of the court of aldermen and common coun|cil of the city of London, who, when he begged leave to re&s;ign his gown, expre&s;&s;ed their entire ap|probation of the diligent, faithful, and hone&s;t di&s;|charge of the &s;everal great and important tru&s;ts they had repo&s;ed in him, both as their repre&s;enta|tive in parliament, and in bearing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively all the great offices of the city.

to be e&s;pou&s;ed by the mini&s;try, it is a ju&s;tice<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> we owe Mr. Heathcote to recapitulate &s;ome of the arguments he u&s;ed to enforce them, again&s;t the execution of a project which he thought cruel in regard to individuals, and prejudicial with re&s;pect to the community. He ob&s;erved, that a reduction of the intere&s;t would di&s;tre&s;s people of &s;mall for|tunes inve&s;ted in the funds, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, of both &s;exes, who were bred to no employment, and incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s; for they could not employ their money to better advantage in commerce, which was already over&s;tocked. "Trade (he &s;aid) was like a tract of pa&s;ture ground, which would maintain a certain number of cattle; but if that number was doubled, the whole mu&s;t &s;tarve." He launched out into a detail of particulars. He took notice, that tho&s;e who engaged in commerce, upon &s;mall capitals, mu&s;t be utterly undone, with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign commi&s;&s;ions, which would always be confined to a few hands: that the foreign markets were already over&s;tocked with commodities, &s;upplied not only by Briti&s;h mer|chants, but al&s;o by their rivals of France, who could afford to under&s;el the Engli&s;h traders, be|cau&s;e they were le&s;s encumbered with heavy taxes and high duties: that, in the mo&s;t advantageous branches of traffick, no merchant could gain above five per centum per annum upon any adventure; for although goods &s;ent to Li&s;bon would &s;ell for a profit of twenty-five pounds per centum, yet the ri&s;ques he mu&s;t run, and the length of time he mu&s;t wait for payment, would reduce his profit even to common intere&s;t; for he would be ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="444" REF="4690">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to a double hazard of the &s;eas, fir&s;t to Li&s;|bon, and then to Bra&s;il; and likewi&s;e to the dan|gers of a double credit, fir&s;t of the merchants in Li&s;bon, and afterwards of their corre&s;pondents in the We&s;t Indies: that as men of &s;mall capitals could not afford to lie &s;o long out of their money, and mu&s;t be ruined by &s;mall lo&s;&s;es, they would avoid engaging in commerce under &s;uch di&s;advan|tages, and, rather than &s;tarve at home, remove them&s;elves and their little fortunes into &s;ome other country, where, though the &s;ecurity might not be &s;o good, the intere&s;t was much higher: thus the nation would be at once deprived of its &s;ubjects, and drained of its money: that, by ve&s;ting their property in the French funds, they could draw an intere&s;t of &s;ix per centum, and would probably fix their own habitation where their fortune is depo|&s;ited; e&s;pecially when this motive would be rein|forced by other powerful con&s;iderations, &s;uch as the cheapne&s;s of living in France, the agreeable climate, the gaiety and good humour of the inha|bitants: that the Dutch, who were tempted to embark their money in the Engli&s;h funds, for the &s;ake of reaping better intere&s;t than they could make in Holland, would gradually withdraw that money, when the intere&s;t &s;hould be reduced &s;o low as to be in&s;ufficient for defraying the expence of commi&s;&s;ion, brokerage, and transfers, be&s;ides the ri&s;que of corre&s;pondents; by which means the price of &s;tock would &s;ink &s;o low, that they might gradually purcha&s;e again at &s;uch a di&s;count as would amply indemnify them for the reduction of the former intere&s;t: thus the nation would an|nually
<PB N="445" REF="4700">
pay them as much intere&s;t as before, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> be as much more in their debt, as their capital would be now increa&s;ed. He reminded the hou&s;e, that they repre&s;ented not only the landed, but al&s;o the monied intere&s;t, and both were equally inti|tled to their protection; that though the reduction of intere&s;t might prove beneficial to the landed in|tere&s;t, which comprehended the greater number, that benefit could not ju&s;tify their di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the le&s;&s;er number; that nothing could ju&s;tify their &s;a|crificing the few to the many, but &s;uch a national nece&s;&s;ity as did not then exi&s;t: that, if the &s;inking fund had been kept &s;acred for the purpo&s;es for which it was originally de&s;igned, great part of the national debt mu&s;t have been already payed off, and in a few years the whole would be di&s;charged; that it was &s;till &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, &s;hould it be con&s;cientiou&s;ly applied for the future: that the pre&s;ent &s;cheme, in&s;tead of contributing to the di&s;|charge of the national debt, would only afford a larger &s;inking fund for enabling &s;ome mini&s;ter to extend the &s;y&s;tem of c&mdash;n, and pro&s;ecute with more eagerne&s;s and effect tho&s;e continental views &s;o foreign and de&s;tructive to the true intere&s;t of Great Britain. Finally, he undertook to demon|&s;trate, that the reduction of intere&s;t, far from proving beneficial to the landed intere&s;t, would oblige the land-holders to mortgage greater parts of their e&s;tates, for portioning their younger chil|dren, than was nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent; and likewi&s;e to retrench in their manner of living: a circum|&s;tance that would nece&s;&s;arily&punc;le&s;&s;en the con&s;ump|tion of what the lands produced, and, by affecting
<PB N="446" REF="4710">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the tenant, of con&s;equence dimini&s;h the value of the e&s;tate. Whether the&s;e arguments were conclu|&s;ive we &s;hall not pretend to determine: in &s;ome in&s;tances it mu&s;t be allowed his predictions were verified. The high intere&s;t given abroad hath tempted &s;everal &s;ubjects of Great Britain to tru&s;t large &s;ums of money in the funds of France; and if this example, exhibited by individuals of im|men&s;e wealth, hath not been followed by per&s;ons of narrow fortunes, on whom the temptation might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a greater effect, their he&s;itation may be imputed to the intervention of two &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive wars, which have broke out and been main|tained with &s;uch animo&s;ity between the two na|tions. With re&s;pect to the &s;inking fund, &s;o con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the reduction of intere&s;t, we do not find that Mr. Heathcote was much mi&s;taken in his progno&s;tic, touching the application of that &s;acred depo&s;it. As for the Dutch adventurers, the &s;udden &s;inking of the Engli&s;h &s;tocks has not only prevented them from &s;elling out at a large di&s;|count, but al&s;o invited them to purcha&s;e more ca|pital, upon which they have gained a very con&s;ide|rable intere&s;t; and this, in all probability, will be added to the debt which England already owes to their country.</P>
<P>Having thus granted all the reparation in our power to alderman Heathcote, we &s;hall act with the &s;ame candour towards commodore Moore, commander of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron at the Leeward in&s;lands, who complains that his conduct had been, in &s;ome particulars, mi&s;repre&s;ented in our account of the expedition to Martinique and Guadalupe.

Captain Jekyll (not captain Harman) commanded the Rippon, and executed his orders in a few minutes. The damage he &s;u&s;tained was from one or two &s;mall batteries on the &s;ide of the hill, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;ide, which had not been perceived: but the Rippon was called of by the commodore, as &s;oon as that &s;tep could be taken with propriety.</P>
<P>P. 137, "The Briti&s;h &s;quadron having arrived at Ba&s;&s;eterre, a council of war was held on board of the commodore's &s;hip; where it was re&s;olved to make a general attack by &s;ea upon the citadel, the town, and other batteries by which it was de|fended."&mdash;There was no council of war held upon this occa&s;ion. The commodore, being well ac|quainted with the place, made a di&s;po&s;ition for the attack, from which he would not be diverted by the opinion of the chief engineer, and other offi|cers, who, after having reconnoitred the fortifica|tions, declared they thought them impregnable to &s;hipping&mdash;as appears from Mr. Moore's letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>

<PB N="453" REF="4780">
after having made a proper di&s;po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> &s;hifted his broad pendant on board the Woolwich of forty guns, as well to direct and keep the tran&s;ports together in a proper po&s;ture for landing with the fir&s;t opportunity, as to cover the di&s;em|barkation; and al&s;o to con&s;ult proper mea&s;ures with the general, who &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of Mr. Moore's being with him, and reque&s;ted that he, with the other general officers and engineers, might be admitted on board the Woolwich, in order to con&s;ult, and take the earlie&s;t opportunity of land|ing the troops, as the &s;ervice nece&s;&s;arily required. That this was a judicious mea&s;ure, appeared in the con&s;equence. Above fifty different &s;ignals were made from the Woolwich to the tran&s;ports, by which they were kept together, &s;o as to be ready to land at an hour's notice. At noon the commodore, having &s;pied a proper opportunity, propo&s;ed to &s;tand in, and land them a little to the northward of the town; but this motion was not approved by the general officers. At three in the afternoon he repeated his offer, a&s;&s;uring them he could per|form the &s;ervice at that time, though the firing had not cea&s;ed; and expre&s;&s;ing his fears, that, if the di&s;embarkation &s;hould be delayed much longer, the opportunity for that night would be lo&s;t, as the tran&s;ports were liable to be &s;eparated by dif|ferent veins of wind from the hills, and the va|rious out&s;ets from the bay. This &s;econd repre|&s;entation produced no effect: but in the twilight the general de&s;ired he would provide boats for &s;ix hundred men, at the head of whom colonel Cla|vering was ready to land, and take po&s;t on the

After having ob&s;erved that they laid him under great difficulty by reque&s;ting that &s;o late in the evening, which might have been granted &s;o ea&s;ily when it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, he took his mea|&s;ures with &s;uch expedition and &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s than an hour the troops were rendezvou&s;ed under the Woolwich's &s;tern, when the landing was again po&s;tponed; though the evening was favourable, the Woolwich at that time very near the &s;hore, and the Spy &s;loop within her, almo&s;t clo&s;e to the beach. In con&s;equence of this delay, it was found extremely difficult to di&s;po&s;e of the men for the night, as it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for them to find their re&s;pective tran&s;ports in the dark: but this difficulty was &s;urmounted by the commodore, who di&s;tributed them among the &s;hips of war. Several ve&s;&s;els, &s;et on fire by the enemy, being &s;een driving about, Mr. Moore, with the tran&s;ports, kept to windward all night, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be able to chu&s;e his anchorage next day. At the &s;ame time he directed the bomb|ketches to play upon the town to amu&s;e the ene|my, and keep them at a di&s;tance, that the troops might land next morning without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>P. 139, &punc;In the mean time, the captain (of the Rippon) threw out a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, to which no regard was paid, till captain Le&s;lie of the Bri&s;tol, coming from &s;ea, and ob&s;erving his &s;itua|tion, ran in between the Rippon and the battery."&mdash;The Rippon was not more expo&s;ed than any other &s;hip. There was no &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s &s;een by any per&s;on on board the Woolwich; and, if there had, there was no occa&s;ion for an order to the cap|tain

<P>P. 140, "In the morning, at day-break, the enemy appeared, to the number of two thou&s;and, about four miles from the town, and began to throw up intrenchments in the neighbourhood of a hou&s;e where the governor had fixed his head|quarters, declaring he would maintain his ground to the la&s;t extremity. To this re&s;olution, indeed, he was encouraged by the nature of the ground, and the neighbourhood of a pa&s;s called the Dos d'Ane, a cleft through a mountainous ridge, opening a communication with Cape&s;terre, a more level and beautiful part of the i&s;land. The a&s;cent from Ba&s;&s;eterre to this pa&s;s was &s;o very &s;teep, and the way &s;o broken and interrupted by rocks and gullies, that there was no pro&s;pect of attacking it with &s;ucce&s;s, except at the fir&s;t landing, when the inhabitants were under the dominion of a pannic."&mdash;The enemy threw up no intrenchments in the way to the Dos d'Ane:&mdash;the pa&s;s was hilly, but very acce&s;&s;ible by means of a tolerable road, tho' &s;tony and rugged. When the governor of Guada|lupe rejected the propo&s;al &s;ent with the flag of truce, the generals would have tried the effect of a &s;econd me&s;&s;age, which Mr. Moore warmly op|po&s;ed, recommending it to him to &s;econd his blow while the enemy were in con&s;ternation, and offer|ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with the marines who were under his command. This attack he the more &s;trongly recommended, as he knew the nature of the cli|mate, and fore&s;aw the troops would &s;oon be weak|ened

<P>P. 143, "In the mean time, the reduction of the i&s;landers, on the &s;ide of Guadalupe, appearing more and more impracticable, the general re&s;olved to transfer the &s;eat of war to the ea&s;tern and more fertile part of the i&s;land, called Grandeterre, which was defended by a &s;trong battery called Fort Louis. In pur&s;uance of this determination, the great &s;hips were &s;ent round to Grandeterre, in order to reduce this fortification, which they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of February."&mdash;Mr. Moore detached the Berwick, commanded by captain Harman, with &s;ome other &s;hips of the line and bomb-ve&s;&s;els, having on board draughts of ma|rines and highlanders. He directed them to at|tack Fort Louis, which they accordingly reduced. They had orders afterwards to crui&s;e all round the i&s;land, to prevent the landing of any &s;uccours from St. Eu&s;tatia, and this &s;ervice they effectually per|formed: for the enemy, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, had no provi&s;ion in the mountains, nor any &s;ort of

<P>P. 145, "The enemy no &s;ooner perceived the coa&s;t clear, than they de&s;cended from the hills, and endeavoured to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town: they afterwards erected a battery&mdash;in the mid&s;t of the&s;e ho&s;tilities the gallant Debri&s;ay, together with ma|jor Trollop, one lieutenant, two bombardiers, and &s;everal common &s;oldiers, were blown up and pe|ri&s;hed by the explo&s;ion of a powder magazine."&mdash;The town was intirely demoli&s;hed, except &s;ome few hou&s;es at the end next Fort Royal; and tho&s;e that came down were only attracted by curio&s;ity to &s;ee the ruins&mdash;the enemy had but two cannon, and the&s;e were &s;piked up by tho&s;e that made a &s;ally from the citadel&mdash;when the magazine blew up, Mr. Moore &s;ent &s;hips immediately to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the fort, which however had &s;u&s;tained very little damage.</P>

Here he refre&s;hed his men, who were grown &s;ick|ly, in con&s;equence of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on &s;alt provi&s;ion: here he had intercour&s;e once or twice a day with general Barrington, by means of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els which pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed from one i&s;land to the other. By remaining in this &s;ituation, he likewi&s;e maintained a communication with the Engli&s;h Lee|ward i&s;lands, which being in a defencele&s;s condi|tion, their inhabitants were con&s;tantly &s;oliciting the commodore's protection; and here he &s;upported the army, the commander of which was unwilling that he &s;hould remove to a greater di&s;tance.&mdash;Had he &s;ail|ed to Port-Royal, he would have found the enemy's &s;quadron &s;o di&s;po&s;ed that he could not attack them, unle&s;s M. de Bompart had been inclined to hazard an action. Had he come to anchor in the bay, all his crui&s;ers mu&s;t have been employed in conveying provi&s;ions and &s;tores to the &s;quadron. There he could not have procured either fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions or water; nor could he have had communi|cation with, nor intelligence from the army, or the Leeward i&s;lands, in le&s;s than eight or ten days.</P>
<P>P. 146, "General Barrington being left with no more than one &s;hip of forty guns, for the protec|tion of the tran&s;ports, formed a plan of pro&s;e|cuting the war in Guadalupe by detachments."&mdash;

His advice he ac|cordingly gave freely, with re&s;pect to the plan for the reduction of Guadalupe, particularly for land|ing at Arnouville; and it appears from general B&mdash;'s letter to this gentleman, that he had done every thing that could be expected from him, for the good of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>P. 147, "Colonel Clavering landed with about eighty men, but found him&s;elf &s;o intangled with mangrove trees, and the mud &s;o impa&s;&s;ably deep, that he was obliged to reimbark."&mdash;The com|modore never dreamed they would attempt land|ing in this place, knowing that the enemy had driven &s;takes under water for the de&s;truction of the boats. The inconveniencies of landing here he had repre&s;ented to the general, before he &s;ailed to Dominique.</P>
<P>Id. ibid. "This project having mi&s;caried, the general detached the &s;ame commanders with a de|tachment of fifteen hundred men, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnouville, at the bottom of the little Cul de Sac, under the protection of his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Woolwich."&mdash;The commodore had pitched upon this as the only place at which the landing could be properly effected, and &s;ent thither the Woolwich to cover the di&s;embarkation."</P>
