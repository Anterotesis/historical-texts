<HEAD>GENERAL POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>FEW Poems, in the cour&s;e of their compo&s;ition, have been laid a&s;ide and re&s;umed more ca&s;ually, or, in con|&s;equence, publi&s;hed more lei&s;urely, than the foreg$ing; on which account, while it does not pretend to the Hor$tian merit of a nine-years &s;crutiny under the correcting hand of its Au|thor, it will not thence, he may perhaps hope, be found to have that demerit which ari&s;es from ill-connected parts and an indige&s;ted plan. For, as a &s;cheme was formed for the whole four books before even the fir&s;t was written; and as that &s;cheme has &s;ince been pur&s;ued with very little, if any devia|tion, it is pre&s;umed that the three latter books will be found &s;trictly con&s;onant with the general principles advanced in the former; which, as it contained the principles, and ended epi&s;odically with a kind of hi&s;toric deduction of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the Art, might have been con&s;idered in the light of an entire work, (as the adverti&s;ement before it hinted) had the &s;ucceeding books been never written.</P>
<P>However, as the whole de&s;ign is at length completed, it may not be ami&s;s to give in this place a &s;hort analy&s;is of the
<PB N="40" REF="41">
&s;everal books, in their order, to &s;hew their connection one with another; and to obviate a few objections which have been made to certain parts of each, by &s;ome per&s;ons who&s;e opinions I highly re&s;pect; objections which I flatter my&s;elf might ari&s;e from their having examined tho&s;e parts &s;eparately, as the &s;eparate publication of the books nece&s;&s;arily led them to do; and which, perhaps, had they &s;een the whole together, they would not have found of &s;o much importance.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t book, as I have &s;aid, contains the general Principles of the Art, which are &s;hewn to be no other than tho&s;e which con&s;titute Beauty in the &s;i&s;ter art of Land&s;cape Painting; Beauty which re&s;ults from a well-cho&s;en variety of curves, in contradi&s;tinction to that of Architecture which ari&s;es from a judicious &s;ymmetry of right lines, and which is there &s;hewn to have a&s;&s;orded the principle on which that formal di&s;po&s;ition of Garden Ground, which our ance&s;tors borrowed from the French and Dutch, proceeded. A principle never adopted by Nature her&s;elf, and therefore con&s;tantly to be avoided by tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to embelli&s;h Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">I know of no objection that has been made to any thing that I have a&s;&s;erted on this head, except to that part in which I have exploded Vi&s;tas and Avenues, which, it has been &s;aid, have in them&s;elves a con&s;iderable &s;hare of intrin&s;ic beauty. I am my&s;elf far from denying this; I only a&s;&s;ert that their beauty is not picture&s;que beauty; and therefore, that it is to be rejected by tho&s;e who follow picture&s;que principles. It is architectural beauty, and accords only with architectural works. Where the Arti&s;t follows tho&s;e principles, vi&s;tas are certainly admi&s;&s;ible; and the French, who have &s;o long followed them, have therefore not improperly (though one cannot help &s;miling at the title) given us in their Dictionary of Sciences, an article of <HI>Architecture du Jardinage</HI>. But did Ga&s;par Pou&s;&s;in, or Claude Lorrain, ever copy the&s;e beauties on their canvas? Or would they have produced a picture&s;que effect by their means if they had? I think this &s;ingle con|&s;ideration will induce every per&s;on of common ta&s;te to allow that the&s;e two principles oppo&s;e one another, and that, when|ever they appear together, they offend the eye of the beholder by their heterogeneous beauty: If therefore vi&s;tas are ever to be admitted, or rather to be retained, it is only where they form an approach to &s;ome &s;uperb man&s;ion, &s;o &s;ituated, that
<PB N="42" REF="43">
the principal pro&s;pect and ground allotted to picture&s;que im|provement lie entirely on the other &s;ide; &s;o much &s;o, that the two different modes of planting can never appear together from any given point of view; and this is the utmo&s;t that I can concede on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="2">II. The picture&s;que principle being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in the fir&s;t book, as well by proofs of its beauty when followed, as of the deformity which re&s;ults from its being de&s;erted, the &s;econd book proceeds to a more practical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, but confines it&s;elf to one point only, the di&s;po&s;ition of the ground-plan, and, that very material bu&s;ine&s;s immediately united with it, the proper di&s;po&s;ition and formation of the paths and &s;ences. The nece&s;&s;ity of attending con&s;tantly to the curvilinear principle is fir&s;t &s;hewn, not only in the formation of the ground-plan, with re&s;pect to its external boundary, but in its internal &s;wellings and &s;inkings, where all abruptne&s;s or angular appearances are as much to be avoided as in the form of the outline that &s;urrounds the whole.</P>
<P>The pathways or walks are next con&s;idered, and that pecu|liar curve recommended for their imitation which is &s;o fre|quently
<PB N="43" REF="44">
found in common roads, foot-paths, &amp;c. and which being ca&s;ually produced appears to be the general curve of nature.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the book is employed in minutely de&s;cribing the method of making &s;unk &s;ences, and other nece&s;&s;ary divi|&s;ions of the plea&s;ure-ground or lawn from the adjacent field or park; a part of the art which is of mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential con&s;e|quence, and which is frequently very difficult both to de&s;ign and execute.</P>
<P>The dryne&s;s of this part of the &s;ubject led me to enliven the book with a concluding Epi&s;ode, and al&s;o to throw into other places of it as much as I could of poetical embelli&s;h|ment; in one in&s;tance perhaps improperly, becau&s;e I have found it has generally been blamed. It is the apo&s;trophe which I have made to the Genius or Mu&s;e of Painting, when I am about to teach the be&s;t colour for concealing upright fences. It has been &s;aid, "Why all this parade about daub|ing a rail?" Now, though I believe I might defend my&s;elf $y the practice of my Ma&s;ters in Didactic Poetry, who frequently by &s;uch apo&s;trophes endeavour to be&s;tow con$$quence on little
<PB N="44" REF="45">
matters, to which they think it nece&s;&s;ary to call the attention, yet I rather chu&s;e to give the objection its full force, and pro|mi&s;e to &s;often the pa&s;&s;age in the next edition; taking leave, however, here to a&s;&s;ert in pro&s;e that it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the rule in que&s;tion; becau&s;e if &s;uch means be not taken for concealment, fences of that kind create much de|formity in the general &s;cene.</P>
<P N="3">III. The THIRD BOOK proceeds to add natural ornament to that ground-plan which the &s;econd book had a&s;certained, in its two capital branches, Wood and Water.</P>
<P>The formation of the outline and po&s;ition of the latter might indeed have been treated in the former book: But as Water, though the greate&s;t ornament of any rural &s;cene, is certainly but an ornament, ina&s;much as the &s;cene may exi&s;t without it; and as there are many beautifully-adorned Places where this additional grace cannot be produced, I thought proper to con&s;ider it only as an adjunct. Somebody has &s;aid (perhaps rather quaintly, yet certainly not without good meaning) that "water is the eye, and wood the eye-brow of nature," and if &s;o, there is &s;urely no impropriety in treating
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the two features together. Certain it is, that, when united, they contribute more than any thing el&s;e to what may be called Scenical Expre&s;&s;ion, without which the picture&s;que Beauty we treat of lo&s;es much of its value.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the judicious arrangement of Wood, con|&s;idered &s;eparately, I treat it under two di&s;tinct heads, that of planting it with a view of concealing defects, and introducing beauty in their place; and for the purpo&s;e of ornamenting the opener lawns. On the former of the&s;e I am more diffu&s;e, becau&s;e it is a &s;ubject which admits of preci&s;e rules. On the latter, as it is the peculiar province of Ta&s;te, and depends chiefly on the eye of the Planter, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily vary his mode of planting as peculiar &s;ituations vary, more could not be &s;aid with propriety: For, where the only thing need|ful is to avoid formality, and to treat Nature (as Mr. Pope excellently expre&s;&s;es it)&punc;
<Q><L>like a mode&s;t fair,</L>
<L>Not over dre&s;s, nor leave her wholly bare,</L></Q>
explicit rules rather tend to mi&s;lead than to direct. I have, however, from ver. 209 to ver. 250, ventur&punc; to pre&s;cribe a few material precepts which are incapable of being mi&s;applied;
<PB N="46" REF="47">
and if to the&s;e be added, what I have &s;aid in the fir&s;t book concerning the fal&s;e ta&s;te of planting di&s;tances, I am in hopes I &s;hall not be thought to have treated this part of my &s;ubject &s;uperficially.</P>
<P>For I would wi&s;h my reader to con&s;ider that the Plan of this Poem differs very materially in one re&s;pect from that of the Georgies of Virgil; and when I &s;peak merely of Plan, I may hope, without appearing arrogant, to bring them to a compari&s;on. His four books treat of four di&s;tinct &s;ubjects; Tillage, Planting, Breeding of Cattle, and Bees. He has no introductory book which treats of the general Art of Agricul|ture: Whereas this Poem, as appears from the analy&s;is here given, employs the fir&s;t book entirely on that general &s;ubject, of which the three following are to be con&s;idered only as illu|&s;trations and amplifications: Where therefore that book had &s;ufficiently explained any topic, more could not be added in any &s;ucceeding one without tautology. And this, I hope, will &s;ufficiently obviate the objection which has been made to this part of the third book.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">As to the &s;econd general topic, Water, as I have heard no objections made to what I have there a&s;&s;erted, and believe every a&s;&s;ertion con&s;onant to the general principles of the art, I &s;hall here add nothing. Yet in the little Epi&s;ode at the end of it, I have been frequently que&s;tioned whom I meant by LIGEA; and it has been thought that I ought not to have run away with one of Virgil's Sea-Nymphs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drymoque, Z$nthoque, <HI>Ligeaque</HI>, Phyll$doceque. C$OR. iv. ver. $$6</NOTE>, to tran&s;port her into an Engli&s;h inland &s;cene. There is &s;ome weight in this objec|tion; and to &s;hew that I think &s;o, I will here di&s;cover what I have hitherto kept as a &s;ort of &s;ecret. The lines, where this Nymph is mentioned, were written in a very retired grove belonging to Mr. Frederic Montagu, who has long honoured me with his friend&s;hip, where a little clear trout|&s;tream (dignified perhaps too much by the name of a River) gurgles very dcliciou&s;ly. The name of this &s;tream is the LIN, and the &s;pring it&s;elf ri&s;es but a little way from his plantations <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At P$pplewick, in N$ttingh$m&s;hire, on the $d$e of the Fore&s;t of S$$$$wood. The village it$$l$ has not been without po$tical not$ce $word$, P$$ J$h$&s;on having taken &s;$me of his $word$ <HI>dramat$$</HI>, from it, in his u$fini&s;hed Pa&s;$oral Com$day, called $span$.</NOTE> I &s;eem to find my&s;elf a&s;ked here pretty ab|ruptly, Why then did you not call your Nymph LIN$$? I
<PB N="48" REF="49">
will own the truth. I had re&s;olved, when I fir&s;t planned my Poem, to bring no in&s;tances from any individual &s;cene: For I thought the nature of its compo&s;ition, as it excluded particu|lar &s;atire, would not, with more propriety admit of particular panegyric; and therefore, by a &s;light alteration in the name, and by &s;ome other as &s;light deviations from the &s;cenery, I cautiou&s;ly ma&s;ked the Naiad in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I will here give the reader another in&s;tance of &s;imilar cau|tion: Finding, in the &s;ame book, occa&s;ion to explode the too great fondne&s;s for exotic plants, I thought that the mo&s;t poetical way of doing it was to exhibit an in&s;tance &s;omewhat in the &s;ame manner in which Virgil introduces his old Corycian Gardener: But to prevent all po&s;&s;ible application, as I thought, I laid my &s;cene on the banks of the remote Swale, where I imagined the ta&s;te for exotics had not yet reached, or at lea&s;t had not yet been carried to any exce&s;s; yet I have been &s;ince told, that the neighbourhood immediately pointed out a cer|tain very worthy Gentleman as the undoubted object of my &s;atire, who&s;e improvements I had never &s;een, nor even heard, that, from the inclemency of the climate, his plantations had ever &s;uffered in the way that I have de&s;cribed. I have, there|fore,
<PB N="49" REF="50">
only to de&s;ire that my readers, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one of my &s;ecrets, would &s;ub&s;titute an N for a G where the name LIGEA occurs; and that the re&s;pectable Gentleman, now acquainted with the other, would acquit me of any premedi|tated ridicule on his &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Factitious or artificial ornaments, in contradi&s;tinction to natural ones la&s;t treated, form the general &s;ubject of the FOURTH BOOK, and conclude the plan. By the&s;e is meant not only every aid which the art borrows from architecture; but tho&s;e &s;maller pieces of &s;eparate &s;cenery appropriated either to ornament or u&s;e, which do not make a nece&s;&s;ary part of the whole; and which, if admitted into it, would frequently occa&s;ion a littlene&s;s ill-&s;uiting with that unity and &s;implicity which &s;hould ever be principally attended to in an exten&s;ive plea&s;ure-ground.</P>
<P>Though this &s;ubject was in it&s;elf as &s;u&s;ceptible of poetical embelli&s;hment as any that preceded it, and much more &s;o than tho&s;e contained in the &s;econd book; yet I was appre|hen&s;ive that de&s;criptive poetry, however varied, might pall
<PB N="50" REF="51">
when continued through &s;o long a poem; and therefore, by interweaving a tale with the general theme, I have given the whole a narrative, and in &s;ome places a dramatic ca&s;t. The idea was new, and I found the execution of it &s;omewhat difficult: However, if I have &s;o far &s;ucceeded as to have con|veyed, thro' the medium of an intere&s;ting &s;tory, tho&s;e more important principles of ta&s;te which this part of my &s;ubject re|quired, and if tho&s;e rules only are omitted which readily re&s;ult from &s;uch as I have de&s;criptively given; if the judicious place and arrangement of tho&s;e artificial forms, which give the chief embelli&s;hment to a fini&s;hed garden-&s;cene, be di&s;tinctly noti|ced, I am not without hope that this conclu&s;ion will be thought (as Sir Henry Wotton &s;aid of Milton's juvenile Poems at the end of a mi&s;cellany) to leave the reader in &s;ome &s;mall degree <HI>con la bocca dolce</HI>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the critici&s;ms, which may be made on this la&s;t book, there is one &s;o likely to come from certain readers, that I am inclined to anticipate it; and taking for granted that it will be &s;aid to breathe too much of the &s;pirit of party, to return the following ready an&s;wer: The word <HI>Party</HI>, when
<PB N="51" REF="52">
applied to tho&s;e men, who, from private and per&s;onal motives, compo&s;e either a majority or minority in a hou&s;e of parliament, or to tho&s;e who out of it, on &s;imilar principles, approve or condemn the mea&s;ures of any admini&s;tration, is certainly in its place: But in a matter of &s;uch magnitude as the pre&s;ent American War, in which the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind are concerned, the puny term has little or no meaning. If, how|ever, it be applied to me on this occa&s;ion, I &s;hall take it with much complacency, con&s;cious that no &s;entiment appears in my Poem which does not prove its author to be of THE PARTY OF HUMANITY.</P>
<P>The whole of the Plan being now explained, I might here fini&s;h, did not a general objection remain which I have heard made to the &s;pecies of Ver&s;ification in which I cho&s;e to com|po&s;e it. I mu&s;t, therefore, beg the reader's patience while I inform him why I preferred blank ver&s;e to rhyme on this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t had the &s;ubject in contemplation, I found it admitted of two very different modes of compo&s;ition: One
<PB N="52" REF="53">
was that of the regular Didactic Poem, of which the Georgics of Virgil afford &s;o perfect an example; the other that of the preceptive epi&s;tolary e&s;&s;ay, the model of which Horace has given in his Epi&s;tles <HI>Ad Augu&s;tum &amp; ad Pi&s;ones</HI>. I balanced &s;ometime which of the&s;e I &s;hould adopt, for both had their peculiar merit. The former opened a more ample field for picture&s;que de&s;cription and poetical embelli&s;hment; the latter was more calculated to convey exact precept in conci&s;e phra&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Pope's account of his <HI>d$&s;$$n</HI> in writing the E&s;&s;$y on M$n, in which the peculiar merit of that way, in which he &s;o greatly excelled, is mo&s;t happily explained. He cho&s;e, as he &s;ays, "Ver&s;e, and even Rhyme, for two rea&s;ons: Ver&s;e, became precepts, &s;o written, &s;trike more &s;trongly, and are retained more ea&s;ily: Rhyme, be|cau&s;e it expre&s;&s;es arguments or in&s;tructions more conci&s;ely than even Pro&s;e it&s;elf."</NOTE>. The one furni&s;hed better means of illu&s;trating my &s;ubject, and the other of defining it; the former admitted tho&s;e orna|ments only which re&s;ulted from lively imagery and figurative diction, the latter &s;eemed rather to require the &s;ea&s;oning of wit and &s;atire; this, therefore, appeared be&s;t calculated to expo&s;e fal&s;e ta&s;te, and that to elucidate the true. But fal&s;e ta&s;te, on this &s;ubject, had been &s;o inimitably ridiculed by Mr. Pope, in his Epi&s;tle to Lord Burlington, that it &s;eemed to preclude all other authors (at lea&s;t it precluded me) from touching it after him; and therefore, as he had left much
<PB N="53" REF="54">
un&s;aid on that part of the art on which it was my purpo&s;e principally to enlarge, I thought the Didactic method not only more open but more proper for my attempt. This mat|ter once determined, I did not he&s;itate as to my choice between blank ver&s;e and rhyme; becau&s;e it clearly appeared, that num|bers of the mo&s;t varied kind were mo&s;t proper to illu&s;trate a &s;ubject <HI>who&s;e every charm &s;prings from variety</HI>, and which painting Nature, as <HI>&s;corning control</HI>, &s;hould employ a ver&s;ifi|cation for that end as unfettered as Nature it&s;elf. Art at the &s;ame time, in rural improvements, pervading the province of Nature, un&s;een and unfelt, &s;eemed to bear a &s;triking analogy to that &s;pecies of ver&s;e, the harmony of which re&s;ults from mea&s;ured quantity and varied cadence, without the too &s;tudied arrangement of final &s;yllables, or regular return of con&s;onant &s;ounds. I was, notwith&s;tanding, well aware, that by choo&s;ing to write in blank ver&s;e, I &s;hould not court popularity, becau&s;e I perceived it was growing much out of vogue; but this rea&s;on, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, did not weigh much with a writer, who meant to combat Fa&s;hion in the very theme he intended to write upon; and who was al&s;o convinced that a mode of Engli&s;h ver&s;ification, in which &s;o many good poems, with
<PB N="54" REF="55">
Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t at their head, have been written, could either not long continue unfa&s;hionable; or if it did, that Fa&s;hion had &s;o completely de&s;troyed Ta&s;te, it would not be worth any writer's while, who aimed at more than the reputation of the day, to endeavour to amu&s;e the public.</P>
