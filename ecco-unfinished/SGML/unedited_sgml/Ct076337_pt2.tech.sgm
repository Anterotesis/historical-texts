MERVIN Lord AUDLEY,
Earl of Ca&s;tlehaven, for SODO|MY,
&amp;c. April the 25th, 1631.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Arraignment.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal of
<HI>England,</HI> was appointed Lord
High Steward for that Day,
who having Orders for the
&s;aid Tryal from his Maje&s;ty,
gave Directions for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Lords the Peers took their Places
about Eight of the Clock in the Morning,
and were &s;eated on Benches on each Side of
a large Table cover'd with green Cloth,
and below them were the Judges plac'd,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and the King's learned Council, and the
Officers of the Court; and having di&s;pos'd
of them&s;elves in their &s;everal Places, the
Lord Steward about Nine of the Clock en|ter'd
the Hall uncover'd, with &s;even Maces
carry'd before him by &s;even Serjeants at
Arms, and was attended upon by Sir <HI>John
Burroughs,</HI> Garter-Principal King of Arms,
and Mr. <HI>James Maxwell,</HI> U&s;her of the Black
Rod.</P>
<P>After the Lord Steward had &s;aluted all
the Lords the Peers, (who &s;aluted him a|gain)
he pre&s;ently a&s;cended the State; and
being &s;eated in the Chair, he was pre&s;ented
with his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion, by one of
the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> which bore
Date the 13th of <HI>April, 1631.</HI></P>
<P>After he had receiv'd the &s;aid Commi&s;|&s;ion,
he commanded an <HI>O Yes</HI> to be made,
by one of the Serjeants at Arms, for a ge|neral
Silence; and then deliver'd the &s;aid
Commi&s;&s;ion to Sir <HI>Thomas Fan&s;haw,</HI> Clerk
of the Crown, to be openly read: Which
being done, Mr. <HI>Maxwell</HI> kneel'd down, and
pre&s;ented his Lord&s;hip with a White-Staff
Verge of State, which he gave to one of
the Serjeants at Arms, who held the &s;ame
up by the Cloth of State, on the right
Hand thereof; and after the Commi&s;&s;ion
was read, and the Staff receiv'd as afore|&s;aid,
his Grace commanded a &s;olemn <HI>O
Yes</HI> to be made, and then gave Leave to all
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the Lords the Peers, and the Judges, and
to all Privy-Councellors there pre&s;ent to be
cover'd; and Command was given, that
none under that Degree &s;hould keep on

the Lord High Steward &s;pake to him in the

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Speech.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord <HI>Audley,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE King hath under&s;tood, both by
Report and the Verdict of divers Gen|tlemen
of Quality in your own Country,
that you &s;tand impeach'd of &s;undry Crimes
of a mo&s;t high and heinous Nature; and to
try whether they be true or not, and that
Ju&s;tice may be done accordingly, his Ma|je&s;ty
brings you this Day to your Tryal,
doing herein like the mighty King of Kings,
in the 18th of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> ver. 20, 21. who
went down to &s;ee whether their Sins were
&s;o grievous as the Cry of them. <HI>Becau&s;e the
Cry of</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>is great, and
their Sins be grievous, I will go down</HI> (&s;aith
the Lord) <HI>and &s;ee whether they have done al|together
according to the Cry of it.</HI> And Kings
on Earth can have no better Pattern to fol|low
than the King of Heaven; and there|fore
our Sovereign Lord the King, God's
Vicegerent here on Earth, hath commanded
that you &s;hall be here try'd this Day; and,
to that End, hath caus'd the&s;e Peers to be
<PB N="8" REF="9">
a&s;&s;embled; and the De&s;ire of his Maje&s;ty,
is, that your Tryal &s;hall be as equal as
Equity and Ju&s;tice it&s;elf; and therefore
the&s;e noble Men your Peers [who&s;e Hearts
are as full of Integrity, Ju&s;tice, and Truth,
as their Veins full of noble Blood] are this
Day to try you; wherefore if you be in|nocent,
&s;peak boldly and confidently, and
fear not to ju&s;tify your &s;elf, and be a&s;&s;ur'd
that tho&s;e that accu&s;e you [if you be free
your &s;elf] &s;hall not e&s;cape free. But if
you be guilty of tho&s;e Crimes, I advi&s;e you
to give Honour to God and the King, and
confe&s;s your Fault; for it is not vain Con|fidence,
nor Subtilty, nor &s;tanding out in
Denial, that can hide the Truth; and all
Shifts and Subtilties again&s;t it are but <HI>Con|$ilia
adver&s;us Dominum;</HI> therefore, if Truth
touch you at the Heart, and your Con&s;ci|ence,
which is a thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es, and
God's Grace, which is greater than both,
&s;tand not out again&s;t it. And if you do,
God will put it into the Hearts of the&s;e no|ble
Per&s;ons to find it out, and to do that
which is ju&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord Audley's An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it plea&s;e your Grace,</OPENER>
<P>I Have been a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner the&s;e &s;ix
Months, without Friends, without Coun|cil
or Advice: I am ignorant of Advanta|ges
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and Di&s;advantages of the Law, and am
but weak of Speech at the be&s;t, and there|fore
I de&s;ire to have the Liberty of having
Council to &s;peak for me.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Reply.</HEAD>
<P>FOR your &s;o long Impri&s;onment, it hath
been to you a &s;pecial Favour; for you
have had Time enough to bethink your&s;elf,
and more than ever any Man had that
hath been committed for &s;uch an Offence,
and more Favour than ever any had that
came to this Bar; and you &s;hall demand
nothing which the Law can allow, but you
&s;hall have it. But for your Demand, I
mu&s;t move it to the Lords the Judges, and
they &s;hall &s;atisfy you in it, or any other
Thing you de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Then his Grace de&s;ir'd to be re&s;olv'd of the
Judges, whether this Demand of my Lord <HI>Aud|ley,</HI>
to have a Council to plead for him, might
be granted or not?</P>
<P>The Judges an&s;wer'd, that in criminal
Ca&s;es Council is not to admitted for Mat|ter
of Fact, but for Matter of Law they
may.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Steward proceeded to the
Charge, and commanded the three Indictments
to be read by Sir <HI>Tho. Fan&s;haw,</HI> Clerk of the
Crown; two for Sodomy with <HI>Lawrence Fitz-Patrick</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
his Footman, the third for a Rape
committed on his own Wife, the Counte&s;s of
<HI>Ca&s;tlehaven.</HI> Then being a&s;k'd whether he was
guilty of them or not guilty? He an&s;wer'd, Not
guilty.</P>
<P>Then he was a&s;k'd how he would be try'd?
<HI>The Earl &s;aid, By God and my Peers:</HI>
Whereupon the Peers put off their Hats, and
thereupon the I&s;&s;ue was join'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Speech to the Lords.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Pri&s;oner &s;tands indicted for a Rape
by one Indictment, and of Sodomy
by two; and he hath pleaded not guilty to
them all: It is my Duty to charge you
with the Tryal of it, and you are to judge
of it.</P>
<P>The Offences wherewith he &s;tands char|ged,
are to be prov'd by Evidence; and
becau&s;e the Crimes that come this Day be|fore
us, may in &s;ome breed Dete&s;tation, and
the Per&s;on of his Lord&s;hip in others may
breed Compa&s;&s;ion, I de&s;ire your Lord&s;hips
to &s;et the&s;e two a&s;ide, and let your Rea&s;on
&s;way your Judgment, and let that rule
your Affections, and your Hearts your
Heads; for neither of the&s;e ought to be put
into the Ballance; for a Grain on either
Side may &s;way the Scale. You are to give
<PB N="11" REF="12">
attentive Hearing, and then to weigh e|qually,
that the Scale may lean the right
Way. The Judges will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the
Point of Law, which if you doubt of, you
are to expound it to me, and I to them.
And this you are to do without corporal
Oath; for the Law conceiveth you of &s;uch
Integrity, that you will do that for Ju&s;tice
which others do upon their Oaths, and
therefore admit of no Challenge, and God
direct you to do as you ought.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Then Sir Tho. Crew gave the fir&s;t Charge&punc;
and after him Mr. Attorney &s;aid as followeth.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Steward,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e your Grace, there are
three Indictments again&s;t <HI>Mervin</HI>
Lord <HI>Audley;</HI> the fir&s;t for a <HI>Rape,</HI> the other
two for <HI>Sodomy.</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;on is honourable; the Crimes of
which he is indicted di&s;honourable; which,
if it fall out to be true, [which is to be left
to Tryal] I dare be bold to &s;ay, never Poet
invented, nor Hi&s;torian writ of any Deed
&s;o foul. And altho' <HI>Suetonius</HI> hath curiou&s;ly
&s;et out the Vices of &s;ome of the Emperors
who had ab&s;olute Power, which might
make them fearle&s;s of all Manner of Pu|ni&s;hment,
and be&s;ides were Heathens, and
know not God; yet none of the&s;e came
near this Lord's Crimes. The one is a
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Crime, that I may &s;peak it to the Honour
of our Nation, is of &s;uch Variety, that we
&s;eldom or never knew of the like; and for
the other, we &s;carce heard of the like; but
they are of &s;uch a pe&s;tilential Nature, that,
if they be not puni&s;h'd, they will draw
from Heaven a heavy Judgment upon this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Whereupon (Mr. Attorney digre&s;&s;ing from
the Matter) the Lord <HI>Audley</HI> would have in|terrupted
him, and requir'd to hold him to the
Points in the Indictments. But the Lord High
Steward de&s;ir'd his Lord&s;hip to be patient, and
a&s;&s;ur'd him he &s;hould be heard in fit Time at
full. Whereupon Mr. Attorney proceeded again
in his Cha$ge as followeth.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Grace, I can &s;peak
it with Joy and Comfort, that during all
my Time of Service, both in his Maje&s;ty's
Father's Time, and &s;ince he came to the
Crown, I had never the like Occa&s;ion to
&s;peak in this Place again&s;t a Peer of the
Realm before now; and God knows I do it
now with Sorrow, and I hope I &s;hall never
have the like Occa&s;ion to do &s;o much again.
But his Maje&s;ty, who is the Pattern of Ver|tue,
not only as King, but in his Per&s;on
al&s;o; in whom it is hard to judge whether
he mo&s;t excels in Ju&s;tice or Mercy; (but I
rather think in Mercy) for he would have
<PB N="13" REF="14">
my Lord <HI>Audley</HI> (the Pri&s;oner at the Bar)
heard with as much Favour as &s;uch a
Crime can admit; and when he fir&s;t heard
of it, he gave &s;trict Command that the
Truth &s;hould be &s;earch'd out, that his
Throne and People might be clear'd from
&s;o heavy and heinous Sins; and thereupon
he was indicted in his own Country, ac|cording
to the Law, and by Gentlemen of
Worth and Quality. The Bill was found;
and now he is per&s;onally brought to this
Bar, to be try'd by the&s;e his honourable
Peers, &s;uch, of who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Since|rity
there can be no Que&s;tion, but that he
&s;hall have a ju&s;t and honourable Tryal.
And fir&s;t I &s;hall begin with the Indictment
of Rape. <HI>Bracton</HI> tells us of King <HI>Athel|&s;tane</HI>'s
Law before the Conque&s;t. <HI>If the Par|ty
were of no cha&s;t Life, but a Whore, yet there
may be a Ravi&s;hment; but it is a good Plea to
&s;$$y &s;he was his Concubine.</HI></P>
<P>In an Indictment of Rape, there is no
Time of Pro&s;ecution nece&s;&s;ary; for <HI>nullum
Tempus occurr it Regi:</HI> But in Ca&s;e of an Ap|peal
of Rape, if the Woman did not pro|&s;ecute
in convenient Time, it will bar
her.</P>
<P>If a Man take away a Maid by Force,
and ravi&s;h her, and afterwards &s;he give
her Con&s;ent and marry him, yet it is a
Rape.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
For the <HI>Crimen Sodomiticum,</HI> our Law had
no Knowledge of it 'till the <HI>15 H. 8.</HI> by
which <HI>Statute</HI> it was made Felony; and in
this there is no more Que&s;tion, but only
whether it be <HI>Crimen Sodomiticum &s;ine P$ne|tratione;</HI>
and the Law <HI>15 Eliz.</HI> &s;ets it down
in general Words; and where the Law doth
not di&s;tingui&s;h, neither mu&s;t we. And I
know you will be cautious how you will
give the lea&s;t Mitigation to &s;o abominable
a Sin, which brought &s;uch Plagues after it,
as we may &s;ee in <HI>Gen. 17. Levit. 18. Judg.
19. Rom. 1.</HI> But (my Lord) it &s;eem'd to me
&s;trange at the fir&s;t, how a Nobleman of his
Quality &s;hould fall to &s;uch abominable
Sins; but when I found he had given him|&s;elf
over to Lu&s;t, and that <HI>Nemo repente fit
Pe&s;&s;imus;</HI> and if once Men habit them&s;elves
in ill, it is no Marvel if they fall into any
Sins; and that he was con&s;tant to no Reli|gion,
but in the Morning he would be a
Papi&s;t and go to Ma&s;s, and in the After|noon
a Prote&s;tant and go to a Sermon.
When I had con&s;ider'd the&s;e Things, I ea|&s;ily
conceiv'd, and &s;hall be bold to give
your Grace a Rea&s;on why he became &s;o ill.
He believ'd not God; he had not the Fear
of God before his Eyes; he left God, and
God left him to his own Wickedne&s;s; and
then what may not a Man run into? What
Sin &s;o &s;oul? What Thing &s;o odious, which
he dares not adventure? But I find in him
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Things beyond all Imagination, for I find
his ill Imagination and Intentions bent to
have his Wife naught with the wickede&s;t
Man that ever I heard of before; for who
would not have his Wife vertuous and good,
how bad &s;oever him&s;elf be? And I find
him Bawd to his own Wife. If &s;he love
him, &s;he mu&s;t love <HI>Skipwith;</HI> (whom he ho|nour$d
above all) and not any hone&s;t Love,
but in a di&s;hone&s;t Love; and he gives his
Rea&s;ons by Scripture: <HI>She was now made
&s;ubject to him;</HI> and therefore if &s;he did Ill
at his Command, it was not her Fault but
his, and he would an&s;wer it. His irregu|lar
Bounty toward <HI>Skipwith</HI> was al&s;o re|markable.
He lets this <HI>Skipwith</HI> (whom he
calls his Favourite) &s;pend of his Pur&s;e
<HI>500 l. per Annum;</HI> and if his Wife or
Daughter would have any Thing, tho' ne|ver
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, they mu&s;t lie with <HI>Skip|with,</HI>
and have it from him, and not other|wi&s;e,
al&s;o telling <HI>Skipwith</HI> and his Daugh|ter-in-Law,
he had rather have a Child by

<HI>&s;pake la&s;civiou&s;ly to her, and told her,</HI> that
now her Body was his, and that if &s;he lov'd
him &s;he must love <HI>Amptil;</HI> and that if &s;he lay
with any other Man, with his Con&s;ent, it was
not her Fault but his; and that if it was his

<P>That one Night, being a Bed with her
at <HI>Founthill,</HI> he call'd for his Man <HI>Brodway,</HI>
and commanded him to lie at his Bed's-Feet;

call'd him to light a Pipe of Tobacco;
<HI>Brodway</HI> ro&s;e in his Shirt, and my Lord
pull'd him into Bed to him and her, and
made him lie next to her; and <HI>Brodway</HI> lay

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have &s;een the Clearne&s;s of the
Proofs, and I know your Wi&s;doms to
be &s;uch, (as you well know) in &s;o dark a
Bu&s;ine&s;s clearer Proofs cannot po&s;&s;ibly be
had; for let a Man be never &s;o wicked, or
never &s;o impudent, he will not call Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to &s;ee his Wickedne&s;s, yet you &s;ee
here this Point fully prov'd.</P>
<P>Then he &s;hew'd how both the Laws of
God and Man be again&s;t <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and cited
<HI>Levit. 18.</HI> towards the End, <HI>That by the&s;e
Abominations the Land is defil'd; and therefore
the Lord doth vi&s;it this Land for the Iniquity
thereof.</HI> And then concludes, that God may
remove and take away from us his Plagues.
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Let this wicked Man (&s;aith he) be taken
away from among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Then the Earl <HI>[after the Lord Steward had
told him that he &s;hould be heard in his own De|fence,
with as much Patience as was admitted
in his Charge]</HI> enter'd into his own Defence.
But the Lord Steward advis'd him to &s;peak
pertinently; whereupon he alledg'd, that
he was a weak Man, and of ill Memory,
and therefore de&s;ir'd that he might not be
interrupted.</P>
<P>I. Then he began his Defence with Ex|ceptions
again&s;t his Wife, urging, that &s;he
was naught and di&s;hone&s;t with <HI>Brodway,</HI> by
her own Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Whereunto the Lord Steward an&s;wer'd,</HI>
That this made again&s;t his Lord&s;hip; therefore
he ought not to alledge for his Defence that
Fact, as an Imputation to his Wife, which he
forc'd her unto by Compul&s;ion and Violence.</P>
<P>II. Then he objected again&s;t the Incom|petency
of the Witne&s;&s;es, as the one his
Wife, the other his Servants; and they
drawn to this by his Son's Practice, who
&s;ought his Life; and he de&s;ir'd to know, if
there were not a Statute again&s;t the In|competency
of Witne&s;&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
The Judges re&s;olv'd him, that there was
none touching Witne&s;&s;es; but in Ca&s;es of High
Trea&s;on, there was a Statute concerning Ac|cu&s;ers.</P>
<P>III. The he de&s;ir'd to be re&s;olv'd, whe|ther,
becau&s;e <HI>Brodway</HI> doth not depo&s;e any
Penetration, but only that he emitted up|on
her Belly while the Earl held her, that
&s;hould be judg'd Felony as for a Rape?</P>
<P>The Judges re&s;olv'd it to be a Rape, and &s;o
con&s;equently to be Felony.</P>
<P>IV. Then he de&s;ir'd to be re&s;olv'd, whe|ther
his Wife is to be allow'd a competent
Witne&s;s again&s;t him, or not?</P>
<P>The Judges re&s;olve, that in Civil Ca&s;es the
Wife may not; but in a Criminal Cau&s;e of this
Nature, where the Wife is the Party griev'd,
and on whom the Crime is committed, &s;he is to
be admitted a Witne&s;s again&s;t her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Lord High Steward</HI> de&s;ir'd the
<HI>Lords the Judges</HI> to re&s;olve the Que&s;tions
which Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> in his Charge &s;ubmit|ted

<P>1. Whether it were to be accounted <HI>Bug|gery</HI>
within the Statute, without Penetra|tion?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
The Judges re&s;olve, that it was; and that
the U&s;e of the Body, &s;o far as to emit thereupon,
makes it &s;o.</P>
<P>2. Whether, it being prov'd that the
Party ravi&s;h'd were of evil Fame, and of
an uncha&s;t Life, it will amount to a Rape?</P>
<P>The Judges re&s;olve it to be a Rape, though
committed on the Body of a common Strumpet;
for it is the Inforcing again&s;t the Will which
makes the Rape; and a common Whore may be
ravi&s;h'd again&s;t her Will, and it is Felony to do it.</P>
<P>3. Whether it is adjudg'd a Rape, when
the Woman complaineth not pre&s;ently?
And whether there be a Nece&s;&s;ity of Accu|&s;ation
within a convenient Time, as with|in
24 Hours?</P>
<P>The Judges re&s;olve, That in as much as &s;he
was forc'd again&s;t her Will, and then &s;hew'd
her Di&s;like, &s;he was not limited to any Time for
her Complaint; and that in an Indictment,
there is no Limitation of Time, but in an Ap|peal
there is.</P>
<P>4. Whether Men of no Worth &s;hall be al|low'd
&s;ufficient Proofs again&s;t a Baron or
not?</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="29">

<P>&startq;OH think upon your Offences! which
are &s;o heinous and &s;o horrible, that
a Chri&s;tian Man ought &s;carce to name
them, and &s;uch as the deprav'd Nature
of Man [which of it &s;elf-carries a Man
to all Sin] abhorreth! And you have
not only offended again&s;t Nature, but
the Rage of a Man's Jealou&s;y! And al|tho'
you die not for that, that you have
abus'd your own Daughter! And having
both Honour and Fortune to leave be|hind
you, you would have had the im|pious
and &s;purious Off-&s;pring of a Harlot
to inherit! Both the&s;e are horrid Crimes.
But, my Lord, it grieves me to &s;ee you
&s;tand out again&s;t the Truth &s;o apparent;
and therefore I will conclude with this
Admonition, That God might have ta|ken
you away when your were blinded
in your Sins, and therefore hope he hath
re&s;erv'd you as a Subject of his Mercy;
and as he &s;ends you to &s;ee this Day of

neverthele&s;s, I confe&s;s, I have de&s;erv'd
Death, and to that $nd I am brought
hither, which God in his Mercy enable
me to undergo. And whereas, at my
Tryal, there was &s;ome Que&s;tions made
of my Religion; I do confe&s;s that herein
I have been too negligent, and have too
much externally favour'd P$pery and
Super&s;tition; but, in my Judgment and
Opinion, I have always held the Pro|te&s;tant
Religion, and the Tenets of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> how&s;oever outward|ly
I have too much favour'd Popery;
which God of his infinite Mercy, for his

loud Voice, [being the &s;ame Articles afore|&s;aid

when &s;he te&s;tify$d he lay with her by Force,

&s;he wi&s;hed to look on the Pri&s;oner; unto

had been offer'd unto her, and &s;he &s;uffer'd by

Fitz-Patrick <HI>reply'd,</HI> That he
thought neither the Laws of the Kingdom re|quir'd,

take away any one's Life, and made him&s;elf

concerning the Words of the Sta|tute,
which run, <HI>to charge him alone to be,
and accounted a Felon in Law, that committed
a</HI> Buggery <HI>with Man or Bea&s;t.</HI> [For which

&s;uffer'd.]</P>
<P><HI>The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice reply'd,</HI> That for|a&s;much
as every Acce&s;&s;ary to a Felony is a Felon
in Law; &s;o he being a voluntary Pro&s;titute,
when he was not only of Under&s;tanding and
Years to know the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Sin, but
al&s;o of Strength to have with&s;tood his Lord,

his Honour, and &s;peaking it in the Plu|ral
Number [as the Mouth of the whole
Board] that what&s;oever he deliver'd
&s;hould no ways prejudice him&s;elf; he
thereby got him to declare the Earl
guilty of the Sin of Buggery; wherein
him&s;elf being a Party, was the only
Cau&s;e he came now to &s;uffer Death; for
which his Lord&s;hip's Skill and Policy in
&s;ifting him, together with Di&s;pen&s;ation
of his Promi&s;e and Oath, he freely for|gave
him; &s;aying farther, the &s;aid Lord
had done him no Wrong, becau&s;e he
therein was but an In&s;trument to &s;end
him out of this World into a better.
Then he proceeded to a Kind of a De|mand
<PB N="47" REF="48">
of the Company, or rather a Re|hear&s;al
of the Earl's denying the Sin at
his Death; touching which he de&s;ir'd
and wi&s;h'd my Lord had not &s;o &s;poken,
[if he did] for it was too true; his Lord|&s;hip
had both bugger'd him, and he his
Lord&s;hip. That it was true [for &s;ome
private Di&s;contentment] he bore a little
Malice to the Earl and <HI>Skipwith,</HI> for
which he a&s;k'd God Forgivene&s;s. That
<HI>Brodway,</HI> if he had done any Thing to
the Counte&s;s, he did it not out of his
own ill or corrupt Nature, but was pro|vok'd
and per&s;waded to it by the Earl.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He clear'd the young Lord, as never
being any Occa&s;ion or Means of his Fa|ther's
Death, in hiring or per&s;uading
him to give Evidence, as he had done.
He confe&s;s'd he had liv'd an ill Life, in
that he had delighted in Drinking, Who|ring,
and all manner of Uncleanne&s;s;
but now, as he was heartily &s;orry, &s;o he
doubted not of Mercy of Almighty God,
to pardon and forgive him all his Sins,
through and for the Merits and Media|tion-Sake
of <HI>Christ Je&s;us,</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin,
and the Saints in Heaven.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That he had fallen or run into the&s;e
erroneous Sins, and e&s;pecially that which
he came to die for, in Regard and by
Rea&s;on he had neglected, and not &s;o du|ly,
as he &s;hould have done, repair'd to his
<PB N="48" REF="49">
Gho&s;tly Father, to make Confe&s;&s;ion, and
take In&s;tructions from him. That after
he did make Confe&s;&s;ion, and his Sins
known to the Prie&s;t, he was not only
&s;orry for them, but al&s;o re&s;olv'd never
to come into my Lord's Hou&s;e again;
yet true it was he did; but it was thro'
Frailty, and becau&s;e he was not furni|&s;hed
of another Place.&endq;</P>
<P>So turning again to Mr. <HI>Brodway,</HI> and
per&s;uading him to embrace the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Faith,
wherein, as he perceiv'd his Labour was in
vain, &s;o the Sheriff and other Per&s;ons of
Quality willed him to forbear, and &s;hut up
his Di&s;cour&s;e, unle&s;s he had any thing
more to &s;ay to the Purpo&s;e. Whereupon,
praying for the King, Queen and State, he
betook him&s;elf to private Prayer, and
therein for the mo&s;t part continu'd to his
Death.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brodway</HI> came, [and as it was thought
by the Company, a true Penitent] and af|ter
fetching a deep Sigh at the Sight of the
Tree, he lifted up his Eyes and Hands to|wards
Heaven, making and &s;aying to him|&s;elf
two &s;hort Prayers; &s;o attending <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI>'s
Di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;ate in private Medi|tation,
often making it manife&s;t he was in
Prayer mo&s;t of the Time, and al&s;o rejoy|cing
at the A&s;&s;embly's well wi&s;hing of him,
<PB N="49" REF="50">
for which he return'd (tho feign'd) Smiles
and Thanks. His Time being come to
to &s;tand up, and have the Halter put about
his Neck, and &s;o to declare him&s;elf, he wil|lingly
&s;uffer'd the one, and proceeded to
the other. Fir&s;t a&s;king <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> if he
had done, he pull'd a Sheet of Paper out of
his Pocket; which being writ broadways,
he could not &s;pread it to read, therefore de|&s;ir'd
to have his Hands unty'd, which was
done, and he read it di&s;tinctly to the A&s;|&s;embly;
the Effect whereof, was, to de|clare
him&s;elf guilty, in the Sight of Al|mighty
God, of Death and Damnation;
for that he had broke all the Command|ments,
in Thought, Word, and Deed, and
&s;inn'd in Pride of Life, Lu&s;t of the Eye,
Conceit of his own Beauty, matchle&s;s
Strength, and other natural Gifts, in De|&s;ire
of Revenge, not pitying the Poor, un|lawful
Riches, not repairing to Sermons,
not ob&s;erving the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For all
which and other his Sins what&s;oever, he
both de&s;ir'd of, and tru&s;ted in God for Par|don,
and that through and for the only
Merits of our Saviour <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> his bit|ter
Death and Pa&s;&s;ion. He expre&s;s'd a
&s;trong A&s;&s;urance, which his very Soul had,
of Forgivene&s;s, in that, through the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Holy Gho&s;t, he had laid
&s;uch Hold on Chri&s;t as he had done.
This Paper-writing contain'd his Confe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="50" REF="51">
and Prayer; al&s;o [as I remember] &s;ome|thing
of his &s;lender Guiltine&s;s and De&s;ert
of Death, but not &s;o much. Then deli|vering
that to the Sheriff, he open'd a lit|tle
Book, entitled, <HI>Learn to die,</HI> and de&s;ir'd
the Company to join with him; &s;o reading
over three &s;hort Prayers, the la&s;t whereof
was compos'd only of Confe&s;&s;ion, and for
Pardon, which Prayer he pronounc'd with
great Comfort, at every <HI>Amen</HI> clapping
him&s;elf on the Brea&s;t; he clos'd it up, and
gave it to his gho&s;tly Father, a Mini&s;ter
and Kin&s;man of his, who came along with
him on Hor&s;eback clo&s;e by the Cart. Then
he pull'd out a little Paper, which contain'd
an excellent Prayer of his own making;
and when he had read, and every one join'd
with him in the <HI>Amen,</HI> he commended it
al&s;o to the Sheriff; and then throwing a|way
his Po&s;ie of Flowers, he rous'd up him|&s;elf,
and &s;aid to this Effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough true it is, what I formerly have de|liver'd
touching my Guiltine&s;s and De&s;ert
of Death, my Meaning was, and is, only in
Re&s;pect of my Sins towards God, and no far|ther
for Breach of the Laws of the Kingdom,
than only lying once with the Lady <HI>Ca&s;tlehaven,</HI>
through Per&s;wa&s;$on of the Earl, who was then
in Bed with her, and u&s;ing &s;ome &s;mall Force
for the Purpo&s;e, wherein and by he did emit,
<PB N="51" REF="52">
but not penetrate her Body. He &s;aid, that he
came not to my Lord with a De&s;ire or Intent
any Ways to &s;erve him, but was rather inclin'd
for the Sea, only Mr. <HI>Skipwith</HI> had drawn him
thither for Society's Sake; where not hearing
from his Friends concerning his intended Voyage,
and being more kindly re&s;pected by the Earl than
he look'd for, he &s;tay'd from Week to Week,
and Month to Month, contrary to his Inten|tion.
Then my Lord, making him his Bed|fellow,
did one Day, when <HI>Skipwith</HI> was with
him in the Garden, [but walking &s;omewhat a|part]
break out in Speeches to him to this Pur|po&s;e:
<HI>Brodway,</HI> thou art young, lu&s;ty, and
well-favour'd, and therefore can't but prevail
with any Woman thou attempte&s;t; wherefore for
that I am old, and cannot live long, my Wife
wholly delighting in Lu&s;t, which I am neither
able nor willing to &s;atisfy, thou may'&s;t do well
to lie with her; and &s;o plea&s;ing her, after my
Death marry her, and thereby rai&s;e thy For|tune.
That <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> knew my Lord had
&s;olicited him again and again, as hearing him
in that Language when they have been in Bed
together, and he lying at the Bed's Feet. <HI>Which
to clear,</HI> he charg'd <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> to &s;peak his
Knowledge; <HI>who reply'd,</HI> 'Twas true. <HI>Then
he was ask'd by one of the Lords,</HI> Whether,
when my Lord &s;olicited him, my Lady de&s;ir'd to
have him know her carnally? <HI>To which he
&s;aid,</HI> No, he would not wrong her, though &s;he
bated him infinitely. But, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I know
<PB N="52" REF="53">
well, if I were minded and able to proffer, &s;he
would not &s;ay nay, for that Mr. <HI>Skipwith</HI> and
<HI>Amptill</HI> lay with her commonly.</P>
<P>That <HI>Skipwith</HI> confe&s;&s;ed to him, how he had
often known her, and gotten a Child upon her,
which &s;he, like a wicked Woman, had made
away, which was the only and &s;ole Occa&s;ion, he
the &s;aid <HI>Skipwith</HI> now hated her, and there|fore
had turn'd to the young Lady <HI>Audley;</HI>
all which he pre&s;um'd <HI>Skipwith</HI> would confe&s;s
upon his Oath. That the Counte&s;s was the
wickede&s;t Woman in the World, and had more
to an&s;wer for, than any Woman that liveth,
as he thought. <HI>At which Word, that Lord
which a&s;k'd him the former Que&s;tion, &s;aid,</HI>
Grow not into a Pa&s;&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Brodway,</HI> and
&s;peak nothing for Malice. <HI>He an&s;wer'd,</HI> God
forbid I &s;hould, I am here in Charity with all
living People, and do as freely forgive my Lord
<HI>Ca&s;tlehaven,</HI> as I do de&s;ire God to forgive me;
but what I &s;peak, is true, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently
an&s;wer before him that redeem'd me, and the
Holy Ghost who &s;anctify'd me: To whom be all
Honour and Glory, now and for evermore&punc;
<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then he proceeded farther, and &s;aid,</HI> That
my Lord would have had him done it long be|fore;
for one Night coming to him to his Bed-Side,
he caught him, and bid him come to Bed
to him and his Wife; that thereupon he made to
<PB N="53" REF="54">
him as if he would; but being got from him, de|parted
the Chamber, never intending to do &s;o
foul a Deed; and that for the Rea&s;ons afore&s;aid
he hated her of all Women living. Howbeit,
that one Time, &s;atisfying my Lord's De&s;ire, he
came to Bed to them, where [being gratify'd]
Nature provok'd him to a kind of De&s;ire, and
he emitted, but did not enter her Body, as he
hop'd for Salvation; that he never knew any
Woman carnally whil&s;t he lived in my Lord's
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>That it was not his Intentions to bring to
Light either my Lord's or my Lady's Shame; but
that when he was upon his Oath, he could not
but &s;peak the Truth; his Nature being never
prone to Lying; or if it were in his Youth, the
good Correction of his Parents had wea$'d him
from it, &s;aying, that his Mother had often told
him the Old Proverb, <HI>A Lyar is wor&s;e than
a Thief;</HI> and he thought he had more Stripes
for that than all Faults el&s;e what&s;oever, That he
had, as he hoped, &s;poke nothing of Moment a|gain&s;t
my Lord at his Arraignment; he could
not now remember every Thing; if he had, he
de&s;ir'd Pardon. <HI>And &s;o concluding his Speech,
prepar'd him&s;elf for Death, pulling out a
la$'d Handkerchief, de&s;ir'd the Executioner
to tie it about his Head. Then pulling off
his Garters, and unbuttoning his Doublet,
Mr.</HI> Goodcoale, <HI>the Mini&s;ter, a&s;k'd him,</HI> If
<PB N="54" REF="55">
he would not have a <HI>P&s;alm. He &s;aid,</HI> Yes, with
all his Heart. <HI>Then he read the 143d</HI>
P&s;alm; <HI>which Mr.</HI> Brodway, <HI>pulling up the
Handkerchief, &s;ung very chearfully, ne|ver
changing Colour at all. The Mini&s;ter
pe&s;ir'd him to make Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith;
&s;o he pronounc'd aloud the Belief.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goodcoale</HI> &s;aid, <HI>The&s;e are the Articles
of the Chri&s;tian Faith, according to the</HI> Church
of England, <HI>into which Faith you was baptiz'd;
pray &s;ignify whether in that Faith you intend to
die?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Yes; for there is no other Faith
[as I &s;uppo&s;e] in and by which a Man can be
&s;av'd.</HI> Then he made Reque&s;t to the She|riffs,
and tho&s;e of Kindred there, <HI>That he
might be bury'd in his own Country.</HI> It was
then told him, <HI>That it was granted, and Or|der
taken to have it &s;o, wherefore he &s;hould
now mind his Prayers.</HI> When his Kin&s;man
a&s;k'd him, <HI>If he had never another Prayer in
his Pocket?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>No.</HI> Then a&s;k'd Mr.
<HI>Goodcoale, If he would &s;ay after him?</HI> And
he &s;aid, <HI>Yes, with all my Heart; but fir&s;t he
de&s;ir'd the Executioner to tie his Hands again.</HI>
Which being done, Mr. <HI>Goodcoale</HI> &s;aid a
&s;hort Prayer to recommend his Soul and
Body to Almighty God, in, and for the
Merits of Chri&s;t's Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o
that he might live and reign with him
for evermore. To which the dying Party,
<PB N="55" REF="56">
and all the Spectators &s;aid, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then
he lifting up his Hands to Heaven, with
the&s;e Words, <HI>Lord Je&s;us receive my Spirit,</HI>
the Cart was drawn away; and &s;ome of his
Friends beat him on the Brea&s;t to rid him
of his Pain. <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> beheld him
hanging; &s;o lifting up his Hands, and
commending him&s;elf to God, in Manner
as afore&s;aid, his Cart was likewi&s;e drawn
away.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> I De&s;ire Mr. <HI>Negus</HI> may be a&s;k'd,
whether the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk</HI>
did not &s;ent &s;ome Me&s;&s;age by him? The
Words I don't confine him to; but, whe|ther
the Me&s;&s;age &s;ent by him to my Lord-Duke,
was not to this Purpo&s;e, That not|with&s;tanding
the Articles, &s;he de&s;ir'd to
know from his Grace, in what Manner
&s;he &s;hould live, and that &s;he would be
govern'd by his Directions?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I think it was much about the
Time of the Tran&s;action of the&s;e Articles
the Dutche&s;s &s;ent to me. Mr. <HI>Longueville</HI>
was Council for the Duke, and Sir <HI>Thomas
Powys</HI> for the Dutche&s;s. Mr. <HI>Longueville</HI>
took what Care he could; and when they
came to talk of their living &s;eperately, I
took it only to be an Apprehen&s;ion and
Fear, that my Lord-Duke would confine
the Dutche&s;s to &s;ome Hou&s;e. My Lady-Dutche&s;s
&s;ent for me. I waited on her;
and &s;he expre&s;s'd her&s;elf very &s;en&s;ibly of
the Misfortunes of the Duke and her&s;elf,
that &s;uch Differences &s;hould have been be|tween
them; and &s;he was de&s;irous to let
<PB N="179" REF="178">
my Lord-Duke know, and de&s;ir'd me that
I would let my Lord-Duke know it, that
&s;he would avoid all Company, that &s;hould
give him any Offence; and that &s;he would
not &s;o much as pay a Vi&s;it, but where he
liked. I acquainted my Lord-Duke with
&s;omething to this Purpo&s;e; for &s;he often
&s;aid to me, more than once or twice, that
if &s;he happen'd to die before my Lord-Duke,
&s;he would leave him her E&s;tate;
and I know I have &s;aid &s;o to my Lord-Duke.</P>
<P>Q. Whether, from that Time, do you
know, that the Duke &s;ent any Me&s;&s;age of
Complaint to the Dutche&s;s, to the Place
where &s;he liv'd, that he would have her
live in any other Way?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I know nothing of that Matter.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether my Lord-Duke
ever de&s;ir'd her to come and live
with him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard of any &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>Q. Did he ever &s;end to her, to avoid
any Company?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard of any &s;uch Thing.</P>
<P>Q. Whether had you any Directions to
attend the Duke, That he would give way
in a Controver&s;y between the Dutche&s;s and
a noble Lord of this Hou&s;e, whether he
would wave his Privilege?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have great Rea&s;on to de&s;ire Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI>'s Favour in this Matter; I know
<PB N="180" REF="179">
not what he aims at. I was call'd to the
Bar before, to &s;peak the Truth; as to the
Matter of the Privilege, I know not what
he means by it.</P>
<P>Q. I meant it only as an In&s;tance of a
civil Me&s;&s;age between the Duke and Dutch|e&s;s,
owning her as his Wife; and that this
was a Me&s;&s;age that be&s;poke a good Under|&s;tanding
between them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Will you have me to give an An&s;wer
to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> my Lords? I confe&s;s the
Duke did &s;end for me, and a&s;k'd how the
Settlement and Agreement were betwixt
the Duke and the Dutche&s;s, becau&s;e of this
Matter of the Privilege.</P>
<P>Q. I did not mean that; but only as a
late In&s;tance of the Duke's owning the
Dutche&s;s &s;o far?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When the Duke &s;ent for me, he
would know, whether by the Agreement,
he was oblig'd to let her have the Privi|lege?
I &s;aid, I under&s;tood it &s;o; and tho'
he had no Mind to do it; but as he had
wav'd his Privilege, in the Ca&s;e of an
Unckle, he would do it for her.</P>
<P>Q. What would have been the Con&s;e|quence,
if the Duke had not wav'd his
Privilege? Would not that have defended
her from a Suit?</P>

pa&s;s again&s;t them, which they could in
Truth and Ju&s;tice prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="203">
But &s;ince none of them appear, the
World will believe their ab&s;enting more
than a Thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es, in Confirma|tion
of what Mr. <HI>Hau&s;eur, Ellen,</HI> and <HI>Bay|ly</HI>
have &s;worn. Who&s;e Evidence not only
&s;tands untouch'd by any thing offer'd by
the Dutche&s;s's Witne&s;&s;es, but is plainly
confirm'd by them in the principal Parts.</P>
<P>This being the Nature of the Proofs,
'tis ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P>1. That there never yet was any Ca&s;e of
this Kind, where the Evidence was not
liable to greater Objections than can be
made to this.</P>
<P>Tho' in the late&s;t Ca&s;e of this Kind,
there was full Conviction of the La|dy's
having Children while &s;he liv'd &s;epa|rate
from her Hu&s;band, and the Pre&s;ump|tion
was very violent who&s;e the Children
were; yet this was but Pre&s;umption, and
that was weaken'd by the Pre&s;umption in
Law, that they were the Hu&s;band's; e&s;pe|cially,
&s;ince there was no direct Proof of
the Lover's ever lying with her.</P>
<P>2. Tho' in that Ca&s;e, by Rea&s;on of the
Interval of Parliament, and Fear of the
Deaths of Witne&s;&s;es, a Suit was begun in
<HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> 'tis taken from thence
while the Suit was depending; therefore,
that was rather an Objection again&s;t pro|ceeding
in Parliament, than an Argument
for it.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="204">
3. In that Ca&s;e, &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es were
examin'd at the Bars of both Hou&s;es, who
had not been examin'd at <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI>
nor any Notice given of their Names be|fore
their Examination.</P>
<P>4. It appears by that Ca&s;e and the pre|&s;ent,
that the Examinations in Parliament
are more &s;olemn and certain than tho&s;e of
the Spiritual Court, which depend too
much upon the Hone&s;ty of the <HI>Regi&s;ter,</HI> or
his Deputy.</P>
<P>5. Before that Ca&s;e, Parliaments have
either broken thro' the Rules which bind
the Spiritual Court, as in the Ca&s;e of the
Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz n. 31.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> where the Par|liament
ratify'd the Marriage, <HI>as lawful

to Mr. <HI>Cambel;</HI> and yet there had been
no Examination of Witne&s;&s;es, but what
had been before the two Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>So long before, in the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Ralph
Sadler,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">37. H. 8.</NOTE> upon Proof before the two Hou|&s;es
that the Lady <HI>Sadler</HI>'s former Hu&s;band
had de&s;erted her, and di&s;appear'd for four
Years before &s;he marry'd Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> the
<PB N="206" REF="205">
Parliament legitimated her Children by
Sir <HI>Ralph.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas &s;ome object again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing
the Bill, as if it would countenance a Ju|ri&s;diction
in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to exa|mine
to &s;uch Matters, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance
or originally; the Objection would be the
&s;ame, if it had begun, as it might, in the
Hou&s;e of Commons; but in Truth would
be of equal Force again&s;t mo&s;t private, and
&s;everal publick Acts, occa&s;ion'd by the
Examination of Witne&s;&s;es, or Notoriety of
Fact.</P>
<P>Since therefore, the Duke has &s;o long,
and &s;o often in vain endeavour'd to be freed
from a Lady, publickly fam'd, and prov'd
to have liv'd with Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI> as
his Wife; the Duke's former Di&s;appoint|ments
cannot but be powerful Arguments
for his &s;peedy obtaining that Ju&s;tice which
the Spiritual Court cannot give him, their
Power reaching, no further than to that
Liberty of living, as <HI>&s;he li&s;t,</HI> &s;ome Years
&s;ince &s;ettled by Articles: But as none of
le&s;s Art and Oratory than her Council
could have turn'd this into a Licence to
commit Adultery, <HI>if &s;he list,</HI> or a Pardon
afterwards; had there not been Evidence
of her Acting according to &s;uch Con&s;tru|ction,
the Duke would have hoped &s;he
had repented of the former Injuries he had
receiv'd from her; but now hopes &s;he &s;hall

not longer continue to bear the Name of

Per&s;picuity: If it be not lawful for any
Man to put away his Wife, and marry
again, except it be in the Ca&s;e of Forni|cation,
(for the di&s;placing the Words, by
putting the Exception before the Marriage,
cannot alter the Sen&s;e,) then, <HI>&agrave; contrario,</HI> it
mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity follow, That if the Wife
be put away for Fornication, the Hu&s;band,
by the Tenor of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Words, is left free
to marry again; which Freedom is not
allow'd to the Adultre&s;s her&s;elf, nor any
Man el&s;e that &s;hall marry her.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> have been oppos'd
to St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> and it has been &s;aid, that
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Words in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> did not pro|perly
belong to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, or the
Chri&s;tian Church, as the Words in St. <HI>Mark</HI>
and St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which are ab&s;olute, do; which
is a Saying that neither I, nor, I think,
no body el&s;e ever heard of before; for
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Sermon in the Mount was &s;poken
to <HI>his Di&s;ciples,</HI> and e&s;pecially belonged to
<HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis clear they are &s;poken to <HI>his Di&s;ci|ples;</HI>
for he &s;ays to them, that they are
<HI>the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the

<HI>&s;uffer Per&s;ecution for his Name's &s;ake;</HI> which
no Man will &s;ay or apply to the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that in the 9th Chapter of
St. <HI>Matthew, Christ</HI> an&s;wers the <HI>Scribes</HI> and
<HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who came to tempt him with
their Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it was lawful for a
man to put away his wife for any cau&s;e,</HI> as
they &s;aid <HI>Mo&s;es had permitted them to do.</HI>
But the An&s;wer that <HI>Christ</HI> gave them,
That it was not lawful, <HI>but only in ca&s;e of
adultery, for men to put away their wives, and
marry another,</HI> was a Rule which concern'd
<HI>all Chri&s;tians</HI> to ob&s;erve for ever after; and
for that Rea&s;on was recorded by St. <HI>Mat|thew.</HI></P>
<P>The Words in St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
are not to be taken ab&s;olutely, but to be
&s;upply'd and under&s;tood by his Words in
St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> as in many other Ca&s;es is
clear, <HI>viz.</HI> The Theif upon the Cro&s;s;
Bapti&s;m in the Name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof many In|&s;tances
may be brought, as the De&s;truction
of <HI>Niniveh, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Words, the Exception
confirms the Rule, and infers a Conce&s;&s;ion,
that in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Fornication,</HI> the putting
away one Wife, and marrying another is
allow'd. It is alike with divers other his
Exceptions, which are found in Scripture:
For Brevity, I will in&s;tance in this one,
<HI>viz. Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e pe|ri&s;h.</HI>

Grace of God they did repent, they &s;hould

<P>The Exception here, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>ni&s;i,</HI> unle&s;s,

not with Truth or Rea&s;on; &s;ince it is not
the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion that is adulterous, but the

rightly &s;aid to be indi&s;&s;olvable; becau&s;e
Marriage is not only a Civil, but a
Divine Conjunction; and is al&s;o of that
Nature, that it cannot be di&s;&s;olv'd
without Detriment to either Party:
Yet it is not &s;o indi&s;&s;olvable, but it
may be di&s;&s;olv'd for a Cau&s;e which

Per&s;ons; and admits and Exception,
whrein God cea&s;es to conjoyn. By
Adultery, two are made not to remain

new Arguments have been &s;tudy'd
and fram'd again&s;t it, &s;ince that Time, I
&s;hall now endeavour to &s;atisfy and clear
them all.</P>
<P>1. The Fir&s;t Argument again&s;t it is,
That the Separation from Bed and Board,
doth not di&s;&s;olve the Bond of Marriage.
To which I mu&s;t reply, as I did before,
That this is a Di&s;tinction without a Dif|ference;
newly invented by the <HI>Canoni&s;ts</HI>
and <HI>School-men,</HI> and never heard of either
in the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> nor in the
Times of the Antient Fathers, who ac|counted
the Separation from Bed and
Board, to be the Di&s;&s;olution of the Bond
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>2. That fir&s;t In&s;titution of Marriage,
that they may be <HI>one Fle&s;h,</HI> is by Adul|tery
di&s;&s;olv'd, when the Adultre&s;s makes
her &s;elf <HI>one Fle&s;h</HI> with another Man; and
<HI>thereby di&s;&s;olves the first Bond of her Mar|riage.</HI></P>
<P>3. The Objection; That if the Bond be
di&s;&s;olv'd, and afterwards, if the Man or
<PB N="220" REF="219">
Woman be reconcil'd, they mu&s;t be mar|ry'd
over again, is no nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence,
no more than 'tis in a Per&s;on
baptiz'd, who may break his Covenant,
and renounce his Bapti&s;m; and yet, up|on
true Repentance, be receiv'd into God's
Favour, by Virtue of the fir&s;t Covenant,
without a new Bapti&s;m. Suppo&s;e a Witch,
who, they &s;ay, makes a Compact with
the Devil, to renounce her Bapti&s;m, &s;hould,
afterwards, by the Grace of God, &s;eriou&s;|ly
and truly repent her&s;elf of the Wick|edne&s;s,
I do not believe, that any Body
would take upon him to baptize her a|gain.
And if a Prie&s;t &s;hould renounce
his Orders, and turn <HI>Turk,</HI> and yet after|wards
repent him, and return into the
Church, he need not be re-ordain'd a
&s;econd Time. The Ca&s;e will be the &s;ame
in Marriage.</P>
<P>4. I &s;aid heretofore, That the <HI>Roman</HI>
Doctors allow'd this Di&s;&s;olution of the
Bond, when the Man and Wife, even af|ter
the Con&s;ummation of Marriage, would
transfer them&s;elves into a Friary, or
Nunnery: But becau&s;e it hath been &s;ince
doubted, that no Authority can be &s;hew'd
for this Particular, I &s;hall here &s;hew it
out of the old Con&s;titutions of the Church
of <HI>England.</HI></P>

Hou&s;e, to come in and go out when

he pretended to be with the Hou&s;e, and
the Dutche&s;s's Bed-Chamber, he could not
tell on what Floor it was, nor what Fur|niture
it had, nor whether wain&s;cotted or

<P>The&s;e Things being ob&s;erv'd, it mu&s;t be

and con&s;ider'd before the Peers, be|fore
the Rejection of the two fir&s;t Bills, and
long before the Agreement for putting an
End to all Controver&s;ies and Debates. Now
'tis very hard to put the Dutche&s;s to Ac|count
again, for tho&s;e very Facts, con&s;i|dering
that, after eight or nine Years, ma|ny
People are dead, others di&s;pers'd, and
not in a little time to be found out, and
Circum&s;tances of Times and Places (which
in the Nature of all the&s;e Ca&s;es is almo&s;t
all that is left to di&s;cover a Fal&s;ity) forgot.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s is al&s;o under the unavoida|ble
Nece&s;&s;ity of proving a Negative again&s;t
downright Swearing, and without any
Matter introductory; and al&s;o by two
mean Servants, the one turn'd out of her
Place for keeping Company with Foot-Sol|diers,
and the other leaving his Place in
Di&s;gu&s;t, becau&s;e he could not have the
Play-Money.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233">
Ma&s;ters are already too much in the Power
of their Servants, and if they charge their
Ma&s;ters with Adultery, Felony, and even
Trea&s;on, it is not ea&s;ily in the Power of
the Ma&s;ter to defend him&s;elf again&s;t down|right
Swearing; Servants having tho&s;e
Opportunities of the Knowledge of Times,
and Places, and Company, which cannot
be deny'd or avoided, and which others
have not, whereupon they may frame and
build fal&s;e Evidence, and many Times are
of ill Principles and de&s;perate Fortunes,
and of Tempers very revengeful; &s;o that
whoever turns away a Servant, he is in
his Power for his E&s;tate, Honour, and e|ven
Life it&s;elf. And therefore, for the
Safety and Freedom of Families, in other
Countries they are not permitted to be E|vidence
again&s;t their Ma&s;ters in any Mat|ter
criminal what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Note al&s;o, That the Dutche&s;s thinks &s;he,
as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject, has, by <HI>Magna Char|ta,</HI>
the &s;ame Right to a Tryal, in the le|gal
and ordinary Way of Ju&s;tice, as the
re&s;t of the King's Subjects, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering
that there never yet was in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
one Precedent of a Bill exhibited in
Parliament to di&s;&s;olve a Marriage at the
fir&s;t In&s;tance, without any previous Pro|ceedings
in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts;
(which in the&s;e Ca&s;es is the Law of the
Land) and not above five or &s;ix Bills,
<PB N="235" REF="234">
in above 600 Years, ever pa&s;s'd to di&s;&s;olve
Marriages, or make &s;econd Marriages good,
even after there had been a Divorce in the
Spiritual Courts; and tho&s;e Bills too, in
Ca&s;es generally where the Hu&s;bands were
without any Re-crimination.</P>
<P>No Impediment appears why the Duke
&s;hould not have endeavour'd a Divorce at
Law, before he had attempted a Bill to
di&s;&s;olve the Marriage. For any Applica|tion
to the Legi&s;lature, for Tryal of Mat|ters
of private Right, is improper; becau&s;e
there are proper Judicatures, that give that
Remedy the Law allows.</P>
<P>To a&s;k any thing of the Legi&s;lature, in
private Cau&s;es between Party and Party,
beyond what the known Laws in Force
give, &s;eems to be improper; becau&s;e,</P>
<P>1. It is to make a Law in one Per&s;on's
Ca&s;e, which is not the Law in another's.</P>

equally the Subjects Right with the Law;
and the Application to the Legi&s;lature
takes away all that Right of Form and
Charging; whereas a Certainty in Time
to an&s;wer, and Exceptions to Witne&s;&s;es,
<PB N="236" REF="235">
and other legal Defences of the Fact, can|not
be deny'd the meane&s;t Subject.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence that &s;hort and &s;umma|ry
Ways of Proceedings may have on the
Settlements of E&s;tates and Families, may
be very dangerous; and tho' the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Bill pa&s;s'd the Hou&s;e of Peers, yet
a great Number of the Peers both Spiritual
and Temporal, enter'd their Prote&s;t again&s;t
its Pa&s;&s;ing, and their Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>It ought to be no Prejudice to the
Dutche&s;s, that the next Heir pre&s;umptive
to the Duke, doth not as yet appear to be
a Prote&s;tant; becau&s;e when the Bill, which
hath lately pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es, is become
a Law, it is not likely that noble Fami|ly
will be without a Prote&s;tant at the
Head of it.</P>
<P>If any of the Witne&s;&s;es formerly exa|min'd
on the Bill in 1694, be now again
produc'd; it is humbly apprehended, that
as the Validity of their Te&s;timony they
then gave, was totally overthrown by a
greater Number of Witne&s;&s;es, &s;o it will be
again; tho' under the Di&s;advantage of the
great Di&s;tance of Time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> with your
Favour, Sir, I am of Council with the Pe|titioner,
the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> again&s;t
his Bill that is now before you; and I be|lieve
I may &s;ay, with &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, that
<PB N="242" REF="241">
this Bill, in the Manner as it is now
brought before you, is the fir&s;t that ever
was attempted in this honourable Hou&s;e.
It's true, Sir, that &s;everal Years ago, this
Bill, or another of the &s;ame Nature, was
attempted twice in the other Hou&s;e, and
as often rejected; but 'tis as true, at la&s;t,
it does come from thence hither, but not
without a Prote&s;tation there; and I hum|bly
hope you will take Notice, that this is
a Bill of Divorce in Parliament, in the
fir&s;t In&s;tance, without a previous Pro&s;ecu|tion,
to examine the Fact in any of the
ordinary Courts, that have Authority in
the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>It is a Bill, not only to divorce the
Dutche&s;s upon a very &s;hort Warning, who
hath been a Wife twenty three Years,
but to render her infamous to all Po&s;terity,
by Act of Parliament; which I account to
be the greate&s;t Misfortune po&s;&s;ible to befal
any Per&s;on; and, at the &s;ame Time, it
takes from her the legal Tryal of the Fact
whereof &s;he is accus'd, and which &s;he hath
a Right to, by the Law of the Land, &s;ure
as much as the meane&s;t Subject; and which
we don't apprehend &s;he has in any wi&s;e
$orfeited; nor is there any Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd
why his Grace has not been pleas'd to pro|ceed
in the ordinary Cour&s;e. I hope, Sir
you will take Notice al&s;o, that this is, i$
Truth, nothing but a Suit between Party
<PB N="243" REF="242">
and Party. 'Tis meerly a Cau&s;e matri|monial
between Hu&s;band and Wife, began
originally in the Hou&s;e of Peers; and as
hitherto, the Beginning of Cau&s;es between
Party and Party, in that Hou&s;e, hath been
&s;trongly oppos'd; &s;o, I hope, it will be
thought rea&s;onable to do &s;o always; be|cau&s;e
it deprives the Subject of that legal
Defence due to him by the Law of the
Land. If this was always complain'd of,
when the Proceedings were in a Judicial
Way; &s;urely, 'tis a great deal wor&s;e, to
begin there a private Cau&s;e between Party
and Party in the Legi&s;lative Way. I can
&s;ee no manner of Difference, with re&s;pect
to the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e great Advantages the
Party is intitul'd to, only this &s;eems rather
to be the mo&s;t again&s;t Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir, This is a &s;ummary Proceeding with a
Witne&s;s: It began but the 16th of <HI>Februa|ry,</HI>
and but a Week's Time was given to
the Party accus'd of &s;o high a Crime, and
of &s;o great Con&s;equence to the Party ac|cus'd,
to be heard to it; and tho', perhaps,
we may, with Rea&s;on enough, find Fault
with the tedious Proceedings in &s;ome Courts,
where Appeals and Writs of Error are ju&s;t|ly
due; as where Property is well fix'd, it
mu&s;t needs be rea&s;onable. I &s;ay, from va|rious
Cau&s;es, tho' Suits in the ordinary
Courts are very tedious; yet, I am &s;ure,
a &s;ummary Way of Proceeding without due
<PB N="244" REF="243">
Warning, or any certain Way of making
Defence by any known Rules, and without
Oath, as here, without Appeal, without
any Po&s;&s;ibility of retrieving the Matter
again, with great Submi&s;&s;ion. And if this
mu&s;t be for all that one has in the World,
&s;uch a &s;ummary Way is a very terrible
Thing.</P>
<P>I would be glad any would make it
their own Ca&s;e, and think with them&s;elves,
how they &s;hould like it, if their Life, E&s;tate,
and all they had, were put upon &s;uch a
&s;ummary Way of Proceeding. 'Tis true,
in &s;ome Kingdoms, where the Government
is Arbitrary, the Proceedings are &s;umma|rily,
and mo&s;t commonly they go toge|ther;
and if we were in a Place where the
Judges were infallible, and there were no
fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, and Truth could be di&s;|cover'd
at an In&s;tant, a &s;ummary Way
would be be&s;t; but &s;ince Men are fallible,
&s;ince there is Pa&s;&s;ion and Partiality in the
World, &s;ince oftentimes there are notorious
Detections of Perjury, and &s;everal Things
are difficult to be di&s;clos'd, and require a
rea&s;onable Time for examining into Facts;
from thence it is, that there are &s;ettled
$span$ for determining all Que&s;tions in
$span$ Party and Party; and
$span$ good Methods
$span$ that
$span$</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="244">
Whatever you may think of this parti|cular
Ca&s;e of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> the
Example is of mighty Con&s;equence to all
Parents, that, perhaps, make hard Shift to
give their Daughters con&s;iderable Portions,
and may think they have marry'd them
well, and made Provi&s;ion for them and
their Children. I &s;ay it will be hard, if
their Daughters &s;hould be &s;ent Home to
them upon a Fortnight's Warning; and
that Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examin'd again&s;t
them, without their having Notice &s;o much
as of the Places of their Abode; and a
Thing &s;hould be determin'd, before the
Witne&s;&s;es can be well known. And it mu&s;t
be agreed to be of great Con&s;equence to all
Colateral Heirs, if Marriages are &s;o ea&s;ily
and &s;uddenly &s;et a&s;ide for want of I&s;&s;ue,
which I find to be one of the Cau&s;es a&s;|&s;ign'd
for this Bill; and that it may be in
a &s;ummary Way, perhaps, before they can
well hear of it. I am &s;ure, this is a Mat|ter
of too great Temptation, to be put upon
Men that may grow weary of their Wives,
and de&s;ire a better Fortune, or de&s;ire
Change, or may be mov'd by a thou&s;and
Rea&s;ons we can't think off, to revive old
Quarrels, and think of Things long &s;ince
pa&s;s'd, if you will &s;et &s;uch a Precedent of
Divorcing in &s;uch a &s;ummary Way.</P>
<P>This is &s;ure of infinite Concern to us in
higher Matters. A Bill of Divorce of a
<PB N="246" REF="245">
Woman in Parliament, without a legal
Tryal, is ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing, as a Bill of
Attainder again&s;t a Man for Trea&s;on; the
one forfeits the E&s;tate, corrupts the Blood,
and takes away his Life; and the other
does very little le&s;s: For, I find, according
to the Bill, 'tis to forfeit her Jointure, to
defame her Per&s;on, corrupt her Reputation;
and tho' it leave her Life, it is left with
Infamy, which is wor&s;e than Death; and
in a Ca&s;e of this high Moment, &s;ure you
will be careful how you alter the Cour&s;e
of Tryals. I be&s;eech you, Sir, will not
the Rea&s;on be the &s;ame, that a Bill of
Attainder may be brought again&s;t a Man,
and that Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him may be
fetch'd from beyond-Sea, which he had
formerly di&s;charg'd from his Service; and
put the other Side to prove what is always
very difficult, the Negative, to make his De|fence,
which mu&s;t needs require a rea&s;ona|ble
Time for the making out of Circum&s;tan|ces,
and laying Evidence together? Where
will be the Difference between proceeding
again&s;t a Man for his Life without a Tryal,
and proceeding again&s;t a Woman for her
Joynture, where her Name, Family, and
Reputation is concern'd; and perhaps her
Children, the Legitimacy of whom mu&s;t
come in Que&s;tion? And, in a Ca&s;e, where
the Per&s;on, by no Behaviour of hers, hath
forfeited &s;uch a Tryal, nor the Per&s;on, that
<PB N="247" REF="246">
pro&s;ecutes this Bill, can't &s;hew that he
hath been ob&s;tructed in his proceeding in
the ordinary Way. I need not take Notice
of what every Body knows, That we have
a happy Con&s;titution, if we can keep it;
every Man can call his Wife his own, and
his E&s;tate his own; becau&s;e it can't be ta|ken
away, but by legal Tryal: But if you
will go into the&s;e extraordinary Re&s;orts,
when the Courts and the Law is open,
without any previous Preparations for
that Matter, by having a fair Examina|tion,
that the Party can't &s;ay there is a
Surpri&s;e, I know not where it will end;
and tho' in one Ca&s;e it may be de&s;irable,
that there &s;hould be an extraordinary Re|lief;
but will this go no farther? Can any
&s;ay that?</P>
<P>That which we find in <HI>Magna Charta</HI> is
not to be forgot, where there is &s;o much
Care in the &s;everal In&s;tances of it for the
pre&s;erving of Property, and the Right of
Tryals, <HI>Quod nullus de&s;truatur, nec &s;uper
eum ibimus, nec &s;uper eum mittemus, ni&s;i per
legale judicium parium &s;uorum vel per legem
terrae.</HI></P>
<P>Why? In this Ca&s;e, the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Law is <HI>Lex Terrae:</HI> And if that be to be
taken away, without any Rea&s;on, why
may not the Law in any other Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We have, perhaps, in Time of great E|mergency
and publick Difficulties, had
<PB N="248" REF="247">
&s;ome extraordinary Laws, grounded on
extraordinary Rea&s;ons; but now we are in
a Time of &s;ettled Peace, when there may
be a ju&s;t Determination, according to the
Law of the Land, I can't &s;ee any Rea&s;on
for this Proceeding, no, not in this parti|cular
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I would, Sir, with your Favour, take
Notice of tho&s;e few In&s;tances of this Kind,
that have been in <HI>England,</HI> by Act of Par|liament,
and in what Manner they have
proceeded.</P>
<P>There have not pa&s;s'd hardly &s;ix in &s;ix
hundred Years, I think I may challenge
them, on the other Side, to &s;hew &s;o great a
Number; but tho&s;e I have I &s;hall quote:
But they proceeded in another Manner
than this had done.</P>
<P>'Tis true, where Per&s;ons have had a fair
Tryal in a proper Court, and Witne&s;&s;es
have been examin'd, and Sentence final
been pronounc'd, and where the Party, as
to the Fact, hath been concluded accor|ding
to the Law of the Land; when all
this hath pa&s;s'd, &s;ome In&s;tances there have
been, that afterwards an Act of Parlia|ment
has pa&s;s'd to &s;trengthen the Sentence,
and to carry it farther than the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Courts will allow, even to the di&s;&s;ol|ving
the Marriage, and enabling the in|nocent
Per&s;on to marry again; but you
will find all tho&s;e Acts are founded and
<PB N="249" REF="248">
built upon the Sentence in tho&s;e Courts,
and recite tho&s;e Sentences, as a great In|ducement
to the pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e Acts; and
I crave Leave ju&s;t to take Notice of tho&s;e.
The fir&s;t we find, is that made in the Ca&s;e
of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI> which was
in 5 <HI>E. 6.</HI> He was marry'd to a Daughter
of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and &s;he elop'd from
him, and was pro&s;ecuted in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Courts, and there was Sentence again&s;t
her of Divorce. The Marquis from hence
took upon him to marry a Daughter of the
Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> and after four Years Mar|riage
of her, he obtain'd an Act of Parlia|ment
to ratify the &s;econd Marriage, which
Act recites a Settlement of Divorce in the
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court.</P>
<P>This took its Ri&s;e from Examination ac|cording
to Law; and that Act of Parlia|ment
is grounded upon it, and recites it as
a previous Matter nece&s;&s;ary to induce that
Act.</P>
<P>The next, that follows, was the famous
Ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> afterwards Earl of
<HI>Rutland,</HI> tho' there, perhaps, was as great
a Notoriety of Fact as can be pretended in
this Ca&s;e; and he did not &s;tand impeach'd
of any immode&s;t Behaviour; but, even in
that Ca&s;e, the Divorce by the Act fol|low'd
a Divorce in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court,
and that pa&s;s'd with &s;uch Difficulty, that
it was four Years in Hand: it began in 66&punc;
<PB N="250" REF="249">
and was not pa&s;s'd 'till 70. I have a Co|py
of it, and it &s;ays, that fora&s;much as
<HI>Mannors,</HI> commonly call'd L. <HI>Ro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And it proceeds thereupon to enable
him to marry again: But this, Sir, could
not be, but by two Acts of Parliament,
be&s;ides the Sentence in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Court; for he fir&s;t got that Court to de|clare
the Children illegitimate, and then,
in the Year 70, the Parliament pa&s;s'd
this Act.</P>
<P>I know of no other, 'till we come to a
Ca&s;e that happen'd within our Memory;
'tis the Ca&s;e of a Per&s;on of great Worth,
and I hope it will give no Offence when I
cite the Precedent.</P>
<P>It was the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Lukenor,</HI> who
had been gro&s;sly abus'd by his Wife, by
Elopement, and open Adultery; but the
Act he obtain'd went no farther, than to
di&s;able the Children born while &s;he liv'd
in open Adultery; and that Act recites a
Sentence of Divorce; I have the Copy of
it, and I crave leave I may read a few
Lines of it; it recites, that Mr. <HI>Lukenor</HI>'s
Wife had elop'd from her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>There was, indeed, a famous Ca&s;e not
long ago, of a Lady that was taken away
by Force, and pretended to be marry'd;
and an Act of Parliament came afterwards
to declare that Marriage null and void;
but even there was a Proceeding at Law
<PB N="251" REF="250">
with a Witne&s;s; the Per&s;on that had been
concern'd, was actually indicted, and exe|cuted:
It was not there to make a Divorce;
and &s;o it had been a vain Thing, to have
gone into the Spiritual Court, where there
was no Marriage; for it was only a Law
after the Fact, Declaratory, by Way of
Caution, to give the more Satisfaction that
that Marriage was null and void.</P>
<P>Sir, the la&s;t I know of (and it may be
proper for you to ob&s;erve how quick the&s;e
People come after it) was that of a noble
Earl, that did obtain la&s;t Parliament an
Act for divorcing him and his Lady. It
is the Ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield;</HI> but
in that Ca&s;e it will be proper to take No|tice
to you, that there were previous Pro|ceedings
in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court; there
was a Libel exhibited again&s;t her, a Charge
upon her, and Witne&s;&s;es examin'd, and &s;he
had a fair Opportunity of making her De|fence;
there was a regular and a long
Proceeding again&s;t her, and a Pro&s;ecution
of her, in Order to a Sentence of Excom|munication;
and then there came the
Earl's Petition into the Hou&s;e of Peers,
&s;etting forth, that there had been &s;uch a
Proceeding as this, and that &s;he &s;tood in
Contempt, having been pro&s;ecuted as far
as that Court could go, after an Examina|tion
of Witne&s;&s;es. In all the Ca&s;es I have
$word$ of a Divorce by Act of Parliment,
<PB N="252" REF="251">
there have been Proceedings in the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
Court. This was the Way of for|mer
Times, but now we are beginning
where the Matter ought to end.</P>
<P>And now the fir&s;t Application is to that
Place, wherein all the&s;e In&s;tances (as I
think it ought to be) was the la&s;t Re&s;ort.
'Tis true, this Method may not plea&s;e the
Duke; for we know his Grace is in ha&s;te,
and for cutting the Knot a&s;under at once
by the Legi&s;lative Power; but, I hope,
upon the&s;e Precedents, you will think it
more rea&s;onable it &s;hould be at fir&s;t unty'd,
or, at lea&s;t, loo&s;en'd by a judicial Pro|ceeding.
If you will, I do not &s;ee how,
in Ju&s;tice, the Parliament can deny the
like Remedy the next Se&s;&s;ions to any other
that may be in the like Ca&s;e, it may be
in wor&s;e; for here is no Pretence of any
&s;purious I&s;&s;ue. Can the Parliament of <HI>Eng|liament,</HI>
whence we take our Mea&s;ures of
Ju&s;tice, deny the like Remedy in Ju&s;tice to
any others that are in the like Ca&s;e? What
is it that guards you from an infinite Ap|plication
of this Nature, but requiring Per|&s;ons
to take the ordinary Cour&s;e fir&s;t; and
to come round about to the Parliament, as
the la&s;t Remedy, to carry the Sentence,
perhaps, farther than the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Court can do? But if Per&s;ons may come
up directly hither, I am apt to think your
Lobby will be crowded with Petitioners of
<PB N="253" REF="252">
this Nature the next Se&s;&s;ions; tho' the Se&s;|&s;ions
now are long and frequent, this &s;ingle
Bu&s;ine&s;s may be &s;o great as to ob&s;truct all
other Bu&s;ine&s;s; I am &s;ure, a Committee for
Adultery would have a full Employment.</P>
<P>Let it be con&s;ider'd, how &s;trange it would
be if &s;ome Poor Man, upon this Precedent,
&s;hould come and make Application, and tell
you, he &s;tands in Need of &s;uch a Bill from
the Condition of his Family; that his
Wife plunders his Hou&s;e, &s;ells his Goods,
and lives in Adultery; and prays this Mat|ter
may be examin'd in a &s;ummary Way,
becau&s;e he is not able to go through the
co&s;tly Cour&s;e of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and be
favour'd with a Divorce: Would not this
poor Man's Ca&s;e &s;eem to have the like Ju|&s;tice,
or po&s;&s;ibly more? And yet, if &s;uch a
mean Man &s;hould come with &s;uch a Petition,
perhaps, it would look &s;trange; and yet, in
Ju&s;tice, there is no Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons; the
Law in <HI>England</HI> is, <HI>unum pondus &amp; una men&s;u|ra;</HI>
and if this &s;hould be done in the Ca&s;e
of a great and rich Man, and not for a poor
Man, they may &s;ay what hath been &s;aid
by &s;ome, That our Laws are like the Spi|der's
Web, which only holds the le&s;&s;er In|&s;ects.</P>
<P>Shall tho&s;e that expect the be&s;t Fortunes
and greate&s;t Advantage by Marriage, not
undergo the bad Fortune of Marriage too?
<PB N="254" REF="253">
I am &s;ure, if this be &s;o, it's a Privilege of
Peerage never thought of before.</P>
<P>You may &s;ee, Sir, by this Bill, how
Precedents grow upon you. At fir&s;t, in the
Ca&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI> it
was hard to get an Act after a Divorce: So
it was in the Ca&s;e of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;s:</HI> The
la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, in the Ca&s;e of the Earl of
<HI>Macclesfield</HI> it went farther there; becau&s;e
there had been a previous Proceeding in
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, and his Lady had
ob&s;tructed that Sentence; that Act pa&s;s'd
before Sentence; but now we are come
to have it done without &s;o much as a
Tryal to get a Divorce in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Courts, to have all pa&s;s'd at once in a
&s;ummary Way, it will be but to petition
the Parliament, and all &s;hall be determin'd
without a Po&s;&s;ibility of being re-heard.</P>
<P>I know nothing can be &s;aid on the
other &s;ide with good Rea&s;on (unle&s;s that
which I heard in another Place) why they
&s;hould not go to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court,
which is, that tho&s;e Courts cannot divorce
a <HI>Vinculo</HI> Matrimony; therefore it would
have been a vain Thing. This may be a
good Rea&s;on for them to come to you after|wards;
but 'tis no Rea&s;on for them to come
here at fir&s;t, unle&s;s they will &s;ay at the
&s;ame Time, that every thing ought to be
begun in Parliament, becau&s;e 'tis po&s;&s;ible
every thing may be brought to the Hou&s;e
<PB N="255" REF="254">
of Peers at la&s;t. Will they &s;ay, That all
Ejectments ought to be begun originally in
the Hou&s;e of Peers; becau&s;e after the Par|ties
have been at great Charge and Trou|ble
in the Courts below, they may be
brought thither by Writ of Error at la&s;t.
This would have been a good Expedient
in a Cau&s;e lately, where a Deed was try'd
over and over; if this be the Rule, it
would be well it were known, and made to
the Law of the Kingdom; for that Law
will be always reckon'd hard, which is
made in one Ca&s;e, if it may not be had
in another; the Law of <HI>England</HI> does go
throughout, and if it be Law for one, 'tis
for another. I have but one Thing more
to lay before you, and that &s;eems worthy
of your Con&s;ideration, be&s;ides all that I
have &s;aid.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve the Bill is general, without
Re&s;traint of Time and Place, or De&s;crip|tion,
or Circum&s;tances relating to the
Fact: Now, Sir, I mu&s;t take Leave to ac|quaint
you, That &s;o long ago as <HI>April,
1694,</HI> his Grace the Duke, (who complains
of this Matter, as if &s;ome new Misfortune
had befal'n him) having made former Com|plaints
and Attempts for obtaining what
he now de&s;ires, did, at la&s;t, in <HI>April, 1694,</HI>
not &s;uddenly, but by Advice of Coun|cil,
with his Friends about him, after a
long Time of Agitation, come to Articles
<PB N="256" REF="255">
with his Wife the Dutche&s;s, of which I
crave Leave only to read the Preamble.</P>
<P>The Articles are between his Grace the
Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Peterbo|rough,</HI>
and recites&mdash;</P>
<P>It is therefore determin'd by the Parties,
and agreed as followeth; and thereupon
the Articles proceed to &s;ettle every thing
between the Duke and Dutche&s;s, to his
own Satisfaction, and according to his own
De&s;ire.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>$word$ printed Ca&s;e</HI> $word$ infra.</NOTE> His Grace hath reap'd the Bene|fit
of tho&s;e Articles, by having receiv'd a
great Sum of Money; and the Dutche&s;s
parted with her Intere&s;t in that great and
noble Manour of <HI>Sheffeild;</HI> his Grace hath
had all that he, on his Part, was to have,
and hath executed abundance of Deeds pur|&s;uant
to this Agreement. Now, if after
all this, there be a Pro&s;pect of farther
Advantage by another Marriage, that will
not move you to give him a Liberty for a
Departure from &s;o &s;olemn an Agreement.
In what a Condition are People, that have
purchas'd their Peace as the Dutche&s;s has,
if they may have Liberty to go back be|yond
this, for the Bill has no &s;tint; &s;ure|ly,
all Reconciliation between Men and
their Wives, and all Acts towards them,
and all Acts of Kindne&s;s are to be favour'd,
and Matters of Divorce are of an odious
<PB N="257" REF="256">
Nature, and not to be encourag'd after
&s;uch Compo&s;ure of Differences, and Recon|ciliation.
We have In&s;tances of &s;ome that
have taken their Wives again, and liv'd
comfortably afterwards; &s;urely, it &s;hall
not be in their Power to go back, and &s;ay,
Pray let us be divorc'd. 'Tis contrary to
the U&s;e of all Acts of Pardon. What is the
End of all Acts of Parliament, of general
Pardon, and all Statutes of Limitation,
but to ea&s;e the People in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? For
'tis impo&s;&s;ible that any Per&s;on can be able
to defend their Actions nine or ten Years
ago, they can't keep their Witne&s;&s;es alive,
and therefore the Law hath often limited
a Time, beyond which, Per&s;ons &s;hall not
go back; and this we think the Duke hath
done by Articles, and &s;urely they are con|clu&s;ive
before God and Man.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more, but that I don't
apprehend the Nation will be in any great
Danger. If the Duke doth, betwixt this and
the next Se&s;&s;ion, proceed in the ordinary
Cour&s;e, and prepare Matters again&s;t ano|ther
Se&s;&s;ion; I am &s;ure 'tis of great Con|&s;equence.
No Man can deny, but we have
a good Con&s;titution; but if it is, in the
Ca&s;e of a particular Per&s;on, to be broken,
&s;uch a Breach in this Con&s;titution may not
be very ea&s;ily recover'd.</P>
<P>I hope, this Cau&s;e, that is precipitated
here out of Time, and before tho&s;e Pre|parations
<PB N="258" REF="257">
were made, that have been in
all other Ca&s;es, &s;hall be remitted to its
proper Place, where her Grace will give
the Duke a Meeting, if they be not before
that reconcil'd.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> I de&s;ire the Favour of a
Word of the &s;ame Side. The&s;e Bills are
not common; I think there are not above
three In&s;tances to be found in the Records
of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Bill is to di&s;&s;olve a Marriage after
twenty three Years Continuance; and that
not upon &s;o many Days Notice, as there
have been Years of the Marriage, for to
&s;erve the particular Purpo&s;es of one Per|&s;on;
'tis a Law after the &s;uppos'd Fact
committed; the Law &s;hould go fir&s;t, and
the Fact follow; it is not a general Law
for all the People of <HI>England;</HI> as &s;uch, it
would have another Con&s;ideration; there
is no Occa&s;ion for particular Law; 'tis a
Bill from the Lords; and, in a little Time,
for what I know, the Lords will pre&s;cribe to
it; there is not one of the&s;e Bills for a Com|moner,
unle&s;s in my Lord <HI>Ro&s;s</HI>'s Ca&s;e,
who was of a noble Family.</P>
<P>'Tis not pretended by this Bill, that the
Dutche&s;s hath had any &s;purious I&s;&s;ue, tho'
that was the Circum&s;tance of one of the
Bills that did pa&s;s, and that was a mate|rial
<PB N="259" REF="258">
Circum&s;tance in the Ca&s;e, and which is
not alledg'd here. The&s;e Bills are not to
be made u&s;e of, but upon extraordinary
Occa&s;ions, and the utmo&s;t Extremity; and
'till then, I hope, &s;uch Bills &s;hall not be
made u&s;e of. And we think the Procee|ding
upon this Bill, in this Ca&s;e, will ap|pear
much harder; for 'tis the fir&s;t In&s;tance
of this Nature, when there has been no
Proceeding in any Court what&s;oever, to
convict the Dutche&s;s of this Offence, no
Citation all this while in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Courts, where the Dutche&s;s might have
an Opportunity to make her Defence.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e Courts have Juri&s;diction in any
one Thing, 'tis in Ca&s;e of Matrimony. If
this was brought into tho&s;e Courts, the
Dutche&s;s would be allow'd to make her
Defence, not only by Way of Re-crimina|tion,
but Examination of Witne&s;&s;es; a
Commi&s;&s;ion might be had to examine Wit|ne&s;&s;es
beyond-Sea; if &s;he had any Witne&s;|&s;es
there, or in the Country; &s;he might
appeal to a &s;uperior Court, and thence to
the Delegates. The&s;e are all proper De|fences
that the Law allows, that there
may be no Surpri&s;e upon the Party; and
if injur'd, he may be righted in another
Place. The&s;e Proceedings, we think, are
nece&s;&s;ary to go before a Bill of this Nature;
for then the Fact would be plain; and if
the Dutche&s;s had been convicted in this
<PB N="260" REF="259">
Manner, as to the Fact, we mu&s;t not have
open'd our Mouths again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Rea&s;on that a Bill is brought
to di&s;&s;olve this Marriage, in a little Time
you may have a Bill to marry People: Be
it enacted for &s;uch and &s;uch Rea&s;ons, &s;uch
Per&s;ons &s;hall be marry'd: This would be a
much readier Way, in Ca&s;e of Contracts,
than any Proceedings in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Courts. And tho' they may &s;ay, the Law
of <HI>England</HI> takes Notice of Contracts of
Matrimony, as well as any other Acts,
that is no An&s;wer; for the Fact is, Whe|ther
there is any Contract of Matrimony,
or no? And &s;o it is here, Whether my La|dy
is guilty of the Crimes charged here in
the Bill? And for this &s;he ought to have a
proper Tryal, and ought to be call'd to an
Account in the ordinary Methods of Law;
and then it might be proper to carry the
Sentence farther than tho&s;e Courts can. I
hope you will be very tender of making a
new Precedent; and I do not know of any
Bill, before this, to convict a Woman of a
&s;uppos'd Crime; then this is the fir&s;t Bill
of this Nature, and you will con&s;ider, whe|ther
you will make a Precedent of it, or
not. Tho' this before you, is the Ca&s;e of a
great and honourable Per&s;on, yet your
Ju&s;tice will be the &s;ame, if it &s;hould happen,
that any other Man in the Kingdom &s;hould
be in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, and willing
<PB N="261" REF="260">
to &s;lip over all Tryals, whereby the Per|&s;on
accus'd might have an Opportunity of
making her ju&s;t Defence; as is the Ca&s;e of
this noble Lady, who is hurry'd on, after
twenty three Years Marriage, to a Deter|mination
in as many Days, in this extra|ordinary
Manner.</P>
<P>I hope, therefore, you will not proceed
in a Bill of this extraordinary Nature, of
which there is not one In&s;tance to be given,
where you have begun to examine a &s;up|pos'd
Crime, but you have always left it
to the Determination of the Law in the
ordinary Cour&s;e; and we think it ought ra|ther
to be &s;o in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e, 'tis not
pretended by the Bill, that there is any
Stop put to their Proceedings there; there
is no Ab&s;ence of Witne&s;&s;es, no Incapacity;
but his Grace may proceed there, to convict
this Lady of the Crime he &s;uppo&s;es her
guilty of, and &s;he will there have her ju&s;t
Defence; and, till then, there is no Crime
for you to judge upon; and, I hope, you
will think fit to reject this Bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pinfold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> I de&s;ire to &s;peak a few
Words as to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law, which
is a Part of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> as much
as any other; for our Law does not receive
<HI>majus &amp; minus;</HI> and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Courts have been &s;ettl'd for &s;everal Ages,
<PB N="262" REF="261">
and are govern'd by &s;uch Rules, which every
Subject hath a Right to. Sir, This Bill is
to di&s;&s;olve the Bond of Marriage, and to
give Leave to marry again; and I crave
leave to &s;hew the Hou&s;e what our Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Con&s;titutions are in that Ca&s;e, and
how tender they have been in that Point,
and how tho&s;e Con&s;titutions are grounded
upon the Canons and Decrees of Councils.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;es where the Bond of Marriage
is to be di&s;&s;olv'd, are but few, and they
ari&s;e before Marriage; 'tis in the Ca&s;e of
the Pre-contract, or Nonage, or Con&s;angui|nity;
and there the Bond is broken by the
Sentence of the Judge, and the Per&s;on hath
Liberty to marry again: But for what
comes afterwards, whether it be the Ca&s;e
of Adultery, or any thing el&s;e, the Law
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, which, as I &s;aid before,
is Part of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> hath been
very careful not to di&s;&s;olve the Marriage.</P>
<P>The 48th Canon &s;ays, If any Lay-man
&s;hall put away his Wife, and marry ano|ther,
he &s;hall be excommunicated: That
was the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e early Days; and
&s;ure they did not think it an indifferent
Matter, becau&s;e they puni&s;h'd it with &s;o
heavy a Puni&s;hment. So it was in the
Council of <HI>Arles, 314;</HI> and there it was
decreed, That if a Man took his Wife in
Adultery, he &s;hould be forbidden to mar|ry.
There, what was to be done? Coun|cil
<PB N="263" REF="262">
&s;hould be given him not to marry
while &s;he liv'd, though &s;he was an Adul|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And in the Council 402, the <HI>Neapolitan,</HI>
Evangelical, Apo&s;tolical Council, it was
decreed, That if a Man was divorc'd from
his Wife, or Wife from her Hu&s;band, they
&s;hould remain unmarry'd. This was the
Sen&s;e of the antient Canons and Coun|cils,
and this is receiv'd into our Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Con&s;titution. In the 15th Year of
the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the Chap|ter
of Divorces, 'tis &s;aid, That upon a
Sentence of Divorce, there mu&s;t be an
Admonition, and a Prohibition, that the
Party &s;hall not marry again.</P>
<P>And in the Year 1602, in the Beginning
of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, there was a farther
Provi&s;ion made, to keep them from be|ing
marry'd again, and that was this,
That they &s;hould give Bond and Security
they &s;hould not marry again. This is
certainly our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution,
and grounded on the Sen&s;e of the Anci|ent
Canons.</P>
<P>Now it remains, to &s;hew &s;ome Advan|tage
this would have had, if &s;he had had
the Tryal, which, of common Right, is
due to the meane&s;t Subject; &s;he would
have had the Advantage of Challenges,
which &s;he can't have here; for here the
Evidence mu&s;t drop from the Witne&s;&s;es
<PB N="264" REF="263">
Mouths, who are Foreigners, and have
been long ab&s;ent; there they mu&s;t give
an Account of them&s;elves, which here hath
not been done by any Body. This Lady
might have given her Exceptions to tho&s;e
Witne&s;&s;es, and had a Commi&s;&s;ion into
<HI>Holland,</HI> to have examin'd how the&s;e Wit|ne&s;&s;es
have behav'd them&s;elves, and whe|ther
the&s;e Per&s;ons were to be believ'd
and credited; here &s;he would likewi&s;e
have had Liberty to give an Account how
this De&s;ign began. I do now &s;peak with
re&s;pect to the Duke; but I do &s;ay, it does
&s;eem to have began a Year and a half
ago. She would likewi&s;e have had the
Advantage of a thorough Reconciliation;
and here are &s;ome Deeds, in 94, between
the Duke and the Dutche&s;s, which I hope,
if the Hou&s;e will take an Account of,
will have its due Effect: She would like|wi&s;e
have had the Advantage of an Appeal,
the common Right of the Subject, and
grounded upon good Rea&s;on; and in ca&s;e
there hath been a Neglect in the fir&s;t
In&s;tances, the Party may be righted in
another Place.</P>
<P>By this Bill &s;he is debar'd of the Ad|vantage
of Re-crimination, to which &s;he
hath a Right; for the Text-Law is&mdash;</P>
<P>And the Text-Law, <HI>de Divortiis,</HI> is
the &s;ame, were the Charge mo&s;t true,
which we do not admit; yet, if &s;he can
<PB N="265" REF="264">
prove the &s;ame thing again&s;t her Hu&s;band,
the Fault of one mu&s;t be &s;et again&s;t the
Fault of another, and he can't have the
Advantage of his Prayer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall repeat only one thing more,
and that is the Ca&s;e quoted already of
the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield;</HI> but, in that Ca&s;e,
the Lady withdrew her&s;elf five or &s;ix
Days before Sentence; yet there the Lady
<HI>Macclesfield</HI> had all her Defences, and even
her Recriminations, and had a Time to
prove it: There was Publication, and a
Day &s;et down for Sentence, but &s;he &s;pun
out the Time 'till the Parliament was
ready to ri&s;e, and then my Lord's Friends
advis'd him to begin in Parliament; and
when the Lords were acquainted of my
Lady <HI>Macclesfield</HI>'s &s;tanding in Contempt
of the Court, and &s;he was pro&s;ecuted &s;o
far, that &s;he was almo&s;t ready to go to
Pri&s;on for her Contempt, then the Hou&s;e
of Lords did think fit to receive my Lord
<HI>Macclefield</HI>'s Bill, and not before; but be|fore
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield</HI> brought his Bill
in Parliament, there was nothing remain'd
to be done in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts
but Sentence. And I hope, for all the&s;e
Rea&s;ons, you will not proceed upon this
Bill.</P>

have been Invaded; and he comes for that
Relief here, which no other Court can af|ford
him; for the Learned Doctor on the
other Side, tells you plainly from the
Canon Law, that there can be no Divorce,
<HI>&agrave; Vinculo Matrimonii</HI> in their Courts. Now
to &s;end us to a Court for Relief, that
they tell us before-hand can give us none,
is in Effect to tell us, we &s;hall have none
at all.</P>
<P>The Bill is founded upon the Sugge&s;ti|ons
contain'd in the fir&s;t three or four
Lines in the Bill, That the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> hath for divers Years liv'd in
Separation from the Duke her Hu&s;band,
and hath had unlawful Familiarity, and
Adulterous Conver&s;ation with Sir <HI>John
Germaine,</HI> and is Guilty of Adultery on
her Part, and hath broken the Bond of
Matrimony: The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons for
which the Duke de&s;ires this Bill may
pa&s;s; 'tis for the Adulterous Conver&s;a|tion
of the Dutche&s;s, not for one &s;ingle
Act, but a continual Series of the like
Acts for many Years; for we &s;hall not
give only one &s;ingle Act, or In&s;tance, in
Evidence, but prove this Conver&s;ation for
&s;everal Years, beginning in Eighty Seven,
and carry'd on to the latter End of Ninety
Five.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="266">
It hath been objected, That this is the
fir&s;t In&s;tance of a Divorce, the fir&s;t Bill
of this Kind, where there has been no
Proceedings in the Spiritual Court: That
'tis the fir&s;t Bill of this Kind, we deny;
but that there have been no Proceedings
in the Spritual Court, we own; for the
Earl of <HI>Macclefield</HI>'s was the &s;ame, to all
Intents and Purpo&s;es, as this is; for tho'
'tis true, they had been in the Spiritual
Court, yet, 'tis as true, they came here
into Parliament, before any Sentence in
the Spiritual Court: Now, to what Pur|po&s;e
is it to go into the Spiritual Court,
and not to &s;tay for the Determination of
that Court, if the Judgment of that Court
is to have any Weight: In the Ca&s;e of
the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> 'tis true, they had
been there, and examin'd Witne&s;&s;es on one
Side, with all Precipitation; yet would
they not &s;tay for a Sentence there, but
quitted their own Proceedings, and came
to the Parliament. Now I do take it,
that they had better never been there,
than to have come away before Sentence.
For when they were in the Spiritual Court,
and were proceeding there, to leave that
Court, &s;hew'd rather a Mi&s;tru&s;t of their
own Ca&s;e. But it was no Objection in
that Ca&s;e, That it was taking it away
from the Juri&s;diction of the Spiritual Court.
We don't come to you for any thing the
<PB N="268" REF="267">
Spiritual Court can grant us; For that
Court goes no farther, if the Fact be
prov'd, then to make a Separation <HI>&agrave; men&s;&agrave;
&amp; thoro;</HI> but the Bonds of Marriage is
to be continu'd &s;till. Now, with Submi&s;|&s;ion,
this is to puni&s;h the Innocent in&s;tead
of the Guilty. What would the Dutche&s;s
de&s;ire more, than to be &s;eparated from
the Bed and Board of her Hu&s;band, to be
left free to accompany Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI>
But we go farther; for we come to the
Parliament to di&s;&s;olve this Marriage, for
that which is allow'd, by &s;everal learned
Writers, to be a ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on for &s;o
doing, for Adultery committed by the
Wife, 'tis expre&s;ly &s;aid, That <HI>a Man &s;hall
not put away his Wife, except in Ca&s;e of
Fornication.</HI> This Text plainly allows,
that, in Ca&s;e of Fornication, a Man might
put away his Wife; but the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Canons
(the Doctor has nam'd,) have put a Con|&s;truction
upon it; &s;ay they, you &s;hall put
her away, but how? She &s;hall be remov'd
from your Bed and Table, but you &s;hall
not marry another. Then they &s;ay, There
is no Precedent of a Bill of this Kind,
but there hath been a previous Pro&s;ecu|tion
in the Spiritual Courts; I agree, in the
Marquis of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s Ca&s;e, that that
Act does recite the Proceedings in the
Spiritual Court; but that Ca&s;e is &s;tronger
than this, for $here the Marquis of <HI>Nor|thampton</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="268">
had marry'd, even in the Teeth
of their Canon Law; and comes afterwards
an Act of Parliament to make this Mar|riage
good; and there the Divorce was no
Ingredient upon the pa&s;&s;ing of the Bill,
but the Parliament Enacted the Marriage
to be Lawful. In my Lord <HI>Ro&s;s</HI>$s Ca&s;e,
there is no Mention of any Divorce. I
appeal to the Journals of your own
Hou&s;e for that. But notwith&s;tanding the
Divorce, the whole Matter was examin'd
over again; Witne&s;&s;es were examin'd, both
in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and here, upon the
fir&s;t Bill which was brought, which was
to Illegitimate, and Ba&s;tardize the Chil|dren;
and the Witne&s;&s;es prov'd, that my
Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> and his Lady, had not laid to|gether
for a long Time; and that &s;he had
kept Company with others; &s;o that the
Parliament did not found the Bill upon
what had been done upon the Divorce.</P>
<P>I appeal to your own Memory, that
in the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI>'s Ca&s;e there
was no U&s;e at all on that Side, the Bill
was brought, that there had been Pro|ceedings
in the Spiritual Court; nor is any
&s;uch thing recited in the Bill, but only
an expre&s;s down right Charge of Adul|tery;
nor was it proper for them to have
mention'd any Proceedings in the Spiri|tual
Court, &s;ince they wav'd that Pro&s;e|cution;
but we, on the other Side, in&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="270" REF="269">
on it, as a Rea&s;on why the Parliament
&s;hould not proceed in it, it being to take
upon them an original Juri&s;diction; but
we were then an&s;wer'd, by a Learned
Gentleman again&s;t this Bill. That it was
in vain to go there, for they could not
give the Remedy that might rea&s;onably
be expected. I beg the favour to mention
a Ca&s;e or two, where Divorces have been
in Parliament, and there have been no
Proceedings in the Spiritual Court: One
of them was the Ca&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Knight,</HI>
who was marry'd <HI>infra Annos Nubiles,</HI> to
Mr. <HI>Goodwin.</HI> Every one knows, that a
Marriage, <HI>infra Annos Nubiles,</HI> is a good
Marriage, and if the Woman be above
Nine Years Old, &s;he &s;hall be Endowed;
and yet, notwith&s;tanding, for &s;ome irre|gular
Proceedings, without going into the
Spiritual Court, they came into Parlia|ment,
and a Bill was pa&s;s'd, by which
this Marriage was di&s;&s;olv'd, and, I think, 'tis
expre&s;ly Enacted, That &s;he &s;hall not marry
'till &s;uch an Age. This goes farther; for here
I am &s;ure the Doctor would have complain'd,
and told you, if there had been Rea&s;on
to di&s;&s;olve the Marriage, they could have
done as great a Feat in the Spiritual
Court; That they could have examin'd
Witne&s;&s;es upon Oath, and could have told
you whether there was proper Evidence;
<PB N="271" REF="270">
yet the Parliament, without any regard
to what they could do, would a&s;&s;ert their
own Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> was mention'd
on the other Side, and therefore I need not
&s;ay any thing to it. There was nothing
of Divorce, nor needed any.</P>
<P>They &s;ay this Bill begins where it is
proper for Matters of this Nature to end;
and that after we have taken a Turn into
the Spiritual Court, and travell'd three or
four Years there, then it will be fit for the
Judgment of Parliament. I would know
if they had been &s;even Years in that Court,
(and perhaps if we come there, we &s;hall not
get out &s;ooner) to what U&s;e the Examina|tion
of that Court would be. This Hou&s;e,
I pre&s;ume, would not let tho&s;e Depo&s;itions
be read here, e&s;pecially if the Witne&s;&s;es to
the&s;e Facts were living.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, This is a very &s;ummary Way
of proceeding, it may be too quick for the
Dutche&s;s; but you may be pleas'd to con|&s;ider,
that there was a Bill brought into
the other Hou&s;e &s;ome Years ago and reje|cted;
upon what Terms, that will re&s;t upon
us, to &s;hew you by and by.</P>
<P>But the Matter was, The Witne&s;&s;es
that prov'd the Fact were &s;ent out of the
Way by the Dutche&s;s and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
when things were under an Examination;
and we hope a Matter of this Nature ne|ver
<PB N="272" REF="271">
&s;hall be baffled, by keeping the Evi|dence
out of the Way.</P>
<P>We told them long ago who the Witne&s;|&s;es
were, they were the Dutche&s;s's Servants,
&s;uch as they thought fit to intru&s;t.</P>
<P>They &s;ay this Bill deprives the Dutch|e&s;s
of her Tryal. I hope no Body thinks
the Parliament will pa&s;s a Bill, without
due Examination of Witne&s;&s;es, and legal
Proof of the Fact, if &s;o, what Matter is
it, whether the Proof be made before the
Parliament, or &s;ome inferiour Court; if the
Dutche&s;s be guilty of this Crime, we come
here for Relief, which the Spiritual Court,
the Doctors tell you, can't give us; &s;ince
the Dutche&s;s hath broke the Bond of Ma|trimony,
we come to you to di&s;&s;olve that
Marriage, and I hope we &s;hall have it.</P>
<P>The Doctor hath in&s;i&s;ted on one Thing
that I think is very extraordinary. He
tells you by the Rules of their Law, if
the Woman can Re-imminate, and prove
her Hu&s;band guilty, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, they
mu&s;t &s;et the Fault of one again&s;t the
Fault of the other.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the Doctor could have told you
the Offence had been equal; that the In|jury
to Families had been equal: A Man,
by his Folly of this Kind, brings no &s;pu|rious
I&s;&s;ue to inherit the Lands of his
Wife, but the Woman deprives her Hu&s;|band
of any Legitimate I&s;&s;ue; for when
<PB N="273" REF="272">
&s;he conver&s;es in this Manner with ano|ther
Man, the I&s;&s;ue may be equally look'd
upon to be that Man's, if not more; and
this Lady hath kept this Conver&s;ation
ever &s;ince the Year Sixteen Hundred Eighty
Seven, and left the Duke.</P>
<P>One Thing is farther objected, and they
in&s;i&s;t upon certain Articles of Agreement
in Ninety Four, and they read to you the
Preamble of them: Why Sir, The Articles
if they come to be read through, I am
&s;ure it wont amount to what they pre|tend;
it does not amount to this, That
&s;he &s;hould live after her own Plea&s;ure:
Indeed &s;he was to have the U&s;e of her
Hou&s;hold Goods, and Servants, and live
where &s;he pleas'd, but that will not ju&s;tify
her in her Way of Living.</P>
<P>Then to tell you, The&s;e are Matters of
a long &s;tanding; They are &s;o, and of a long
Continuance; for if my In&s;tructions prove
true, we &s;hall prove this Scene of Adul|tery
for matter of eight Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively,
and that by Servants that were privy to
the Intrig$es, who were &s;ent away to <HI>Hol|land;</HI>
but no &s;ooner was the Bill baffled,
but the Man was &s;ent for again, and the
&s;ame Conver&s;ation continu'd that was be|tween
the Dutche&s;s and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
before he left <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame was continu'd after he came
back to his Service in 1691, only they
<PB N="274" REF="273">
were &s;omething more cautious, and People
were not admitted &s;o familiarly, to &s;ee
them in Bed together in 1692, and &s;o it
continu'd 'till 1695.</P>
<P>They mention'd the Statute of Limi|tations,
which was to put an End to
frivilous and vexatious Actions; but how
they can apply it to this Ca&s;e, I can't &s;ee,
becau&s;e a Man &s;hall not bring frivilous
and vexatious Actions after a long Di&s;tance
of Time; therefore a Man &s;hall not com|plain,
when he hath receiv'd the greate&s;t
Injury that can be done to Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> They are kind to us again, in re|commending
it to the Duke, to go into
the Spiritual Court 'till next Se&s;&s;ions; but
we think we are in a proper Method here
for that Relief which the Spiritual Court
cannot grant; and &s;ince we have &s;o good
Rea&s;on to come here, if we prove the
Fact, I hope this High Court will not
&s;end away a Complaint of this Nature,
without &s;uch Relief as is &s;uitable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Northey.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am of the &s;ame Side.
I would beg Leave to &s;ay this, as to what
the Council have &s;aid in relation to the
Evidence, That there were three Witne&s;&s;es
examin'd upon Oath, in the Hou&s;e of Peers,
before the Bill did pa&s;s there, and I be|lieve
they are aware of that; and that
when you hear our Witne&s;&s;es, there will
<PB N="275" REF="274">
be no An&s;wer to be given on their Side;
and indeed the Witne&s;&s;es they brought,
were &s;o far from contradicting our Wit|ne&s;&s;es,
that they did really confirm them.
But this is not the Ca&s;e now; what our
Evidence is, or whether it be fit for you
to believe them, that will be when you
have heard them; and for the matter of
the Time, that you can't take Notice of
neither, 'till you hear our Evidence. But
this I may &s;ay, we &s;hall bring a Man
that will &s;peak to within four or five
Years.</P>
<P>But the Matter they apply them&s;elves
to, which is material, is, Whether it is
proper for you to proceed upon this Bill;
that is, to give &s;uch a Relief as we de&s;ire,
by di&s;&s;olving this Marriage. And in the
next Place, Whether this be a proper Time
to ask this Favour.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t, the Learned Doctor tells
you, 'tis not proper at any Time to do it;
for he would have the Canon-Law govern
here, as it does in their Courts. But the
Council, on the other Side, have cited you
&s;everal Precedents where it hath been done.
In the Ca&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
the Second Marriage was contrary to the
Canon-Law, and yet that Marriage was
confirm'd according to God's Law. And
this Bill is to relieve again&s;t the Canon-Law.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275">
Now, whether we are here in a proper
Time, Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> has &s;aid a great
many Things, which may be proper to
many other Purpo&s;es. One Argument was,
becau&s;e the Witne&s;&s;es can't be upon Oath,
but that we know will not prevail in this
Place. In the next Place, they except, be|cau&s;e
this Proceeding is in a &s;ummary Way,
I would know of them, Whether there is
not the &s;ame Objection to all Proceedings
before a Jury, That they have no Notice
what Witne&s;&s;es will be produc'd.</P>
<P>Then in the next Place, they bring a
great Argument from the Recital of &s;ome
of the&s;e Bills, that there have been before
a Sentence in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts.
Now, 'tis true, they have been &s;o in &s;ome
of tho&s;e Ca&s;es; but I beg leave to ob&s;erve,
That in the Ca&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI>
the Bill was not to confirm the
Sentence, or to enable them to marry,
but to deliver them out of the Hands of
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, who &s;aid, it was
not Lawful in that Ca&s;e to marry; for
they were marry'd before.</P>
<P>I beg Leave to &s;ay, That in the Ca&s;e of
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> there was no Notice
in the Bill, that came down to you, of any
Proceedings in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts.
And I take this to be the Rea&s;on, becau&s;e
there was no Sentence; though where there
was a Sentence, they had good Rea&s;on to
<PB N="277" REF="276">
take Notice of it. And I think there is as
much Certainty, and as good Ground to
proceed on this Bill, as in the other Ca&s;e;
for the Witne&s;&s;es have been already ex|amin'd
in the Hou&s;e of Lords. In the
Ca&s;e of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> there was no regard
to the Determination of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Courts, as a Guide to the Parliament; and
it was look'd upon as of no Con&s;equence,
for the Witne&s;&s;es were examin'd again.</P>
<P>'Tis true, when we came before you
without &s;uch a Proceeding, we came under
this Di&s;advantage; you will be &s;ure to
expect a plainer and fuller Proof; but for
that, we will undertake to make the Fact
&s;o plain, that they can't give the lea&s;t Pre|tence
of An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>We are here a&s;king that we can't have
any where el&s;e. Their great De&s;ign is
Delay, and that we have learn'd from the
Civilian, who tells you their Methods are
very grave and deliberate; and that they
may have a Commi&s;&s;ion to examine Wit|ne&s;&s;es
beyond Sea, and that is to inquire
how their own Servants have liv'd beyond
Sea.</P>
<P>As to what Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> would have,
that is, that we &s;hould go into the Spi|ritual
Court, and apply our &s;elves again
here next Se&s;&s;ions; I do not think the Le|gi&s;lature
will &s;end us back to a&s;k that in
the Spiritual Court, which both have &s;ub|mitted
<PB N="278" REF="277">
to; for after the Duke had mi&s;carry'd
in the Relief he &s;ought by another Bill,
by the Dutche&s;s's &s;ending the Witne&s;&s;es out
of the way, why, truly, after that, to
prevent any Pro&s;ecution in the Spiritual
Court, the Dutche&s;s &s;ubmitted to a Sepa|ration
by Articles; and that was all the
Duke could have pretended to by the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Law; we follow her upon that,
and come to enforce that Separation, and
to make it effectual; and for that which
we humbly hope will be thought but Ju&s;tice
to the Duke, that is, to be deliver'd from
this Wi$e, and to have Liberty to marry
again; we think there is no occa&s;ion for
Delay, and that no Body can be hurt by a
Precedent that carries Relief in this Na|ture,
and delivers us from a Law, which,
in the Days of Popery was put upon us.
Upon the whole Matter, I hope you will
think that we are here very properly for
Relief, and that we &s;hall have the Favour
to call our Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Oldi&s;h.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, The great Objection a|gain&s;t
the pa&s;&s;ing of this Bill, was, be|cau&s;e
Witne&s;&s;es had not been examin'd in
the proper Court. 'Tis very true, general|ly
&s;peaking, in Ca&s;es it ought to be &s;o, but
here is a very great Exception to that Rule,
and which I think can't admit of an An&s;wer,
and that is the Notoriety of the Fact; and
in that Ca&s;e they begin with Execution.
<PB N="279" REF="278">
And if that be &s;o, I think there never was
a clearer Demon&s;tration in the World; for
when formerly the Dutche&s;s came to give
in her An&s;wer, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, to
the Charge again&s;t her, &s;he did declare,
That in the Year 83, or thereabouts, &s;he
went out of <HI>England,</HI> and $arry'd three Years,
and return'd about the Time of the <HI>Revolu|tion.</HI>
And it does plainly appear there, be|yond
all Que&s;tion, that &s;he was at <HI>Lam|beth,</HI>
and went under the Name of the Lady
<HI>Becknam,</HI> and was attended by one <HI>Keemer,</HI>
who went then by the Name of <HI>Goodman:</HI>
Be&s;ides this, there are Witne&s;&s;es that &s;peak
to particular Facts. Now, I &s;ay, here is
that which amounts to Demon&s;tration, and
where there is a Notoriety of Fact, that is,
an Exception out of the General Rule, and
'tis proper to begin with Execution.</P>
<P>There is an Exception to the General
Councils and Canons, that have been men|tion'd,
That there &s;hall not be a Divorce,
$span$. Sir, I &s;ay, it was an Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
Con&s;titution, which was again&s;t the
Law of God, and 'tis demon&s;trably &s;o; for
where our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>That a Man &s;hall
not put away his Wife, except in Ca&s;e of For|nication;</HI>
it is plain, that in Ca&s;e of Forni|cation
he may.</P>
<P>There is another thing in&s;i&s;ted on, and
that is, That there was a Reconciliation
between the Duke and his Dutche&s;s. 'Tis
<PB N="280" REF="279">
true, a Reconciliation &s;hould drown all
Things before that Time; but when the Law
takes Notice in Ca&s;e of a Relap&s;e, that does
<HI>recrude&s;cere,</HI> it rubs upon the old Sore; and
then that, which was before laid a&s;leep, is
brought again upon the Stage, and will re|turn
with greater Vengeance. And we have
plain Proof of her living in the &s;ame Man|ner
&s;ince, as before.</P>
<P>But they would in&s;inuate to you, That
in ca&s;e there was a Tryal in the Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Court, there might be a Recrimi|nation;
but there mu&s;t be a Compen&s;ation,
which can't be thought in this Ca&s;e; for I
think in this Ca&s;e, under Favour, there is
no Compari&s;on. I don't think they are
<HI>Paria;</HI> for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the Hu&s;band
to do that Injury as the Wife may; for
&s;he may bring a Ba&s;tard into the Family,
and then the E&s;tate does not go ac|cording
to the Law of God and Nature;
for every Body de&s;ires his own Blood &s;hould
&s;ucceed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall &s;ay but
very little. But three or four Things have
been mention'd on the other Side, which
they offer, as if they conceiv'd them to have
great Weight, and yet they &s;eem to me as
very capable of being an&s;wer'd; and I crave,
your Favour to do it.</P>
<P>They have gone much upon the Proofs
that they are ready to make, and I think
<PB N="281" REF="280">
not very properly, becau&s;e we &s;peak again&s;t
their Proceeding upon this Bill; but I am
&s;ure it turns upon them, for according to their
own &s;hewing, they are very well prepar'd
to proceed in regular Cour&s;e; for they have
their Witne&s;&s;es ready, and nothing does
ob&s;truct them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Serg. Wright</HI> mention'd a Thing, which,
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was &s;urpris'd in; for when
I told him he could not find any Precedent
of &s;uch a Bill as this, without a previous
Preceeding in the Spiritual Court, Mr. <HI>Serg.
Wright</HI> &s;aid, it was quite otherwi&s;e; and,
to &s;hew you it was &s;o, he cited two Ca&s;es,
where there was no Marriage; now I al|ways
under&s;tood a Divorce mu&s;t be in any
Ca&s;e where there was a Marriage; for the
Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Knight</HI>'s, that was very lately;
that was the Ca&s;e of an Infant, who they
pretended to have marry'd, <HI>infra Annos
nubiles;</HI> and therefore, &s;ays he, the decla|ring
of that Marriage to be Null and Void
by Act of Parliament, was a Divorce. The
other was the Ca&s;e of Mrs <HI>Wharton,</HI> which
was no Marriage neither, for Marriage mu&s;t
be by Con&s;ent, and that was a Force; and
that he fancies to be a Ca&s;e where there
was a Divorce too, without proceeding in
the Spiritual Court; and yet, of his own
&s;hewing, it was no Marriage.</P>
<P>Another Thing I am much more &s;urpris'd
at. We in&s;i&s;ted, That they would not &s;hew
<PB N="282" REF="281">
an Act for making a Divorce, without gi|ving
the Party an Opportunity to make a
Defence; and the Doctor &s;ays, In com|mon
Ca&s;es it ought to be &s;o; and they
cited the Ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI>
we fir&s;t mention'd; and the Doctor told
you the Progre&s;s it had; and that there
was a full and regular Proceeding of great
Length of Time; and that my Lady <HI>Mac|clesfield</HI>
had all her Witne&s;&s;es examin'd;
and my Lord pro&s;ecuted her to an Excom|munication,
which, is in Effect, a Sentence;
for it is in our Law, as in Ca&s;e of Out|lawry:
This he calls a Precedent, wherein
they proceeded to get an Act of Parlia|ment,
without a previous Proceeding in
the Spiritual Court.</P>
<P>He tells you, in the next Place, That
notwith&s;tanding the Divorce in the Ca&s;e
of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> the Parliament did exa|mine
Witne&s;&s;es: 'Tis true, they did; for I
don't think they will &s;o entirely pin their
Faith upon tho&s;e Proceedings, as to have
no other Satisfaction. But will he there|fore
&s;ay, they took no Notice of it, when
'tis the Foundation and Ground of the
Bill?</P>
<P>He tells you in the next Place, that the
Crime does not &s;eem equal between the
one and the other; and &s;o, in &s;ome &s;ort,
they redicule the Doctor's Notion of Re|crimination:
But I apprehend the Doctor
<PB N="283" REF="282">
is right in it; for it would be hard, if a
Man &s;hould marry a young Woman, and
give her an ill Example in his own Fami|ly,
(I do not &s;ay 'tis in this Ca&s;e) and bring
her acquainted with loo&s;e and ill Compa|ny,
and by his Example or Provocation,
lead her into the &s;ame Offence. Would
that Man de&s;erve to be rewarded with a
new Wife, and another Portion, becau&s;e
his fir&s;t Wife had only follow'd his Exam|ple?</P>
<P>They &s;ay, The Offence is not equal, be|cau&s;e
the Man brings no Children into the
Family.</P>
<P>I doubt it happens oftentimes to them
that go abroad, that they bring Home that
to their Wives, which &s;ticks longer by them
than their Children.</P>
<P>Then to come and &s;ay, The Articles
can't be of any U&s;e to us at all; and to
imagine, that we u&s;e the Articles &s;o, that
the Dutche&s;s might be at perfect Liberty
to live in Adultery: I wonder how that
Conceit hath follow'd him thither, when
we told him, We had not &s;uch a Thought,
as to live in Adultery; but they do direct
her to live &s;eparate; and &s;o we us'd them
as an An&s;wer to that Part; we us'd them
likewi&s;e as an Act of total Oblivion and
Remi&s;&s;ion of any thing beyond that Time;
and, I hope, to &s;uch Purpo&s;es, they &s;hall
be thought &s;acred.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="283">
Now, I be&s;eech you, Sir, on the whole
Matter, have they, on the other Side, &s;aid
one Thing, but what does totally tend to
bring all Ca&s;es of Adultery immediately
before you? Have they di&s;tingui&s;h'd this
Ca&s;e from the Ca&s;e of any other Per&s;on?
And then, if they have not, I do not &s;ee,
from henceforward, that any but Fools
will go to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts for Re|lief:
For, &s;ays the <HI>Serjeant,</HI> they cannot
give them a final Relief, and enable any
Per&s;on to marry again; and therefore, let
no Body think to go there again; but her$
is a Relief to be had worth a Man's having
But, I hope, we &s;hall have the Benefit of
the Law, as it is, 'till you think fit to alter
it; and then you will erect &s;ome Judicature,
where People may have their Trial. Now&punc;
therefore, the Argument goes too far, or it
argues nothing at all; becau&s;e, if there be
any thing in it, it goes to take away the
Proceedings of tho&s;e Courts totally.</P>
<P>But tho' tho&s;e Courts cannot do all that
the&s;e Gentlemen de&s;ire, they can do what
is very proper to be done. They can exa|mine
Witne&s;&s;es, and pronounce Sentence,
and give the Party a full Opportunity of
knowing the Accu&s;ation and Accu&s;ers;
and then the Ca&s;es, we have mention'd,
have had the Aid of an Act of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="284">
Sir, We have &s;pent a great deal of your
Time already: I hope, &s;ince you &s;ee what
U&s;e they make of the la&s;t Precedent of
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> where he did proceed
to an Excommunication; now from thence
they argue, that you &s;hould proceed ori|ginally
in this Ca&s;e. When is the Time to
make a Stand, but in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e? And
then no Man can complain of any Injury.
If you grant this to my Lord, I think,
in Ju&s;tice, you cannot deny it to any other
that &s;tands in need of it. I believe, there
never was the like before; and therefore, I
hope, you will put a Stop to it here.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dodd.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Gentlemen on the o|ther

Text is &s;o; but he cannot &s;hew you any

as to the Proceeding in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical

but Execution, where there is a Notoriety
of Fact. And here the Fact is notorious;
and therefore you may come up to order
Execution: But that is a &s;trange Doctrine
to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. Would they

That would make Work. Let the Fact be

never &s;o notorious, yet 'tis the Right of all

<P>The Hou&s;e re&s;olv'd it &s;elf into a Committee

<HI>Nolfolk</HI>'s Bill.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwyne</HI> took the Chair of the

<P>And the Council and Sollicitors were call'd
in, and the Bill read to them. And then Mr.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Northey.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I Am of Council for the Duke
of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> I &s;hall not trou|ble
you now (becau&s;e I think it not fit) to
&s;ay any thing for the Bill, for that you
have approv'd of by Commitment of the
Bill; and declar'd it to be a rea&s;onable and
ju&s;t Relief again&s;t the Dutche&s;s, for the
Adultery charg'd in the Bill. I &s;hall not
&s;pend any of your Time in aggravating
the Crime of Adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286">
But that which is incumbent on his
Grace's Council now, is to lay before you
the Proofs of the Fact &s;ugge&s;ted in the Bill.
And the Facts to be prov'd are the Intro|duction
of the Bill; That the Dutche&s;s has
liv'd for divers Years in Separation from
the Duke; and had unlawful Familiarity,
and adulterous Conver&s;ation with Sir <HI>John
Germaine:</HI> And for that Fact we will call
our Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>And our Evidence will make this out to
you, as plain as 'tis po&s;&s;ible to expect a
Matter of this Nature to be prov'd.</P>
<P>However, I think they have manag'd
Things in that Manner, as we &s;hall be
able to give as plain a Proof of the&s;e
Facts, as might be expected of tho&s;e Acts
which are in their own Nature mo&s;t pub|lick.
However, in the Nature of the
Thing, there were but a few Per&s;ons to be
entru&s;ted with it, and tho&s;e were general|ly
Servants who had Attendance on the
Dutche&s;s's Per&s;on. We &s;hall produce you
Servants, both of the Dutche&s;s, and Sir
<HI>John Germaine.</HI> And, I hope, it cannot
be an Objection, That they are Servants;
for, to object to them, for that Rea&s;on, is
to &s;ay, You &s;hall prove the Fact, but you
&s;hall have no Witne&s;&s;es; for the&s;e are
Facts that cannot be prov'd, but by &s;uch
as were concern'd with the Dutche&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="287">
For our Evidence, it will fall out to be
this, The Duke and Dutche&s;s were mar|ry'd
in the Year 1677, and they liv'd to|gether
'till about the Year 1685; and
then the Duke having &s;ome Account of
her Conver&s;ation of this Nature, they did
part, and afterwards &s;he came to live open|ly
with Sir <HI>John Germaine;</HI> for in <HI>May,
1689,</HI> the Witne&s;&s;es will give you an Ac|count,
that for two Months together &s;he
lodg'd with Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> at the Cock-pit;
and they liv'd there as Man and Wife,
as the Witne&s;&s;es phra&s;e it. During the
Time they liv'd there, there was a near
Relation of Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Da|niel
Germaine</HI> his Brother, and Mrs. <HI>Briane</HI>
his Si&s;ter, did frequently come to the Hou&s;e;
and two of the Witne&s;&s;es were frequently
in the Room while they were a-bed toge|ther.</P>
<P>After two Months Time, the Dutche&s;s
thought fit to be a little more private, and
it was given out &s;he was gone to <HI>France;</HI>
but in Truth &s;he remov'd to <HI>Fox-Hall,</HI> to
a Hou&s;e that was taken by Sir <HI>John Ger|maine</HI>'s
Brother, and went by the Name of
my Lady <HI>Beckman;</HI> and &s;he liv'd there
two Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and Sir <HI>John Ger|maine</HI>
came there frequently once or twice in
a Week, and lay there a-Nights. During
that Time, we have two Witne&s;&s;es, that
did attend the Dutche&s;s, as well as at the
<PB N="289" REF="288">
Cock-pit; one of them is <HI>Ellianor Vane&s;&s;e,</HI>
who was hir'd by Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Si&s;ter,
and liv'd with the Dutche&s;s at the Cock-pit
two Months. We have a &s;econd Wit|ne&s;s,
one <HI>Hau&s;eur,</HI> who was with Sir <HI>John
Germaine</HI> at the Cock-pit 15 Days before the
Dutche&s;s went to <HI>Vaux-Hall;</HI> and afterwards
he went to <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> when &s;he remov'd
there, and &s;tay'd with her all the two Years.</P>
<P>The&s;e are both Foreigners, and <HI>Dutch</HI>
People; and it was rea&s;onable enough to
expect foreign Witne&s;&s;es, when an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Dutche&s;s had a foreign Gallant. They are
&s;uch as he thought fit to entru&s;t about
her.</P>
<P>After &s;he had liv'd two Years at <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI>
[this brings her to the Year 1691] &s;he
remov'd Home again to her Hou&s;e at <HI>Mill|bank;</HI>
and there Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> and &s;he
were frequently together, and have been
&s;een a-bed together.</P>
<P>This brings us to the Time when the
Duke having an Account that &s;he had this
Conver&s;ation with Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
brought a Bill into the Hou&s;e of Peers for
a Divorce; but it happen'd, that the
Dutche&s;s and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI> to avoid
the Condemnation, kept the Witne&s;&s;es out of
the Way, and afterwards caus'd them to
be &s;ent into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Woman &s;tay'd abroad 'till about
three Months ago; but the Man return'd
<PB N="290" REF="289">
before into Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Service;
and he will give you an Account of what
Ob&s;ervations he made there, for the Fami|liarity
continu'd between them then. He
was admitted into the Room where they
us'd to be; and he will give you an Ac|count
how he hath &s;een them frequently
together. And he brings it down to with|in
the Year 1695.</P>
<P>We have another Witne&s;s, one <HI>William
Bayley,</HI> who likewi&s;e was a Servant to Sir
<HI>John Germaine,</HI> and came into his Place
when <HI>Hau&s;eur</HI> went beyond-Sea. He is an
unwilling Witne&s;s, becau&s;e he hath been
preferr'd by Sir <HI>John Germaine:</HI> But when
he was upon his Oath in the other Hou&s;e,
he did give an Account, That while he
continu'd in Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Service,
notwith&s;tanding this publick Reproach in
1695 and 1696, &s;he frequently came to
Sir <HI>John Germain</HI>'s Hou&s;e, with one <HI>Keemer,</HI>
whom &s;he had great Confidence in; and
one <HI>Su&s;anna Barrington,</HI> I think yet in the
Dutche&s;s's Service. And this Mr. <HI>Bayley</HI>
will give you an Account, That his Ma|&s;ter
was often from Home; and when he
was &s;o, he us'd to carry his Linnen to this
<HI>Keemer,</HI> who was the Dutche&s;s's Servant,
or this <HI>Keemer</HI> would come to him for it;
and this will bring it down to 1696.
There are &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es to confirm this;
but we think, with Submi&s;&s;ion, after the
<PB N="291" REF="290">
Dutche&s;s had been &s;o accus'd in the Hou&s;e of
Lords of &s;uch a Familiarity, any Evidence
of a Conver&s;ation between them afterwards,
is as much as a thou&s;and Witne&s;&s;es; for no
Woman that valu'd her Reputation, having
been accus'd as &s;he was, would have had any
Conver&s;ation with Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> after|wards.
But we don't want Circum&s;tances
to &s;upport the Evidence of Fact: We have
as plain Evidence in this Ca&s;e, as can be
expected in a Ca&s;e of this Nature. We
will &s;pend no more of your Time, but beg
Leave to call our Witne&s;&s;es.</P>

I &s;hall not mi&s;pend the Time of the Com|mittee,

Conver&s;ation; and this <HI>Su&s;anna Bar|rington</HI>
has withdrawn her&s;elf &s;ince the
Bill was depending in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>'Tis farther prov'd, That Mr. <HI>Daniel

<HI>England</HI> lately, and that the&s;e were privy
to the &s;ame Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Then the Witne&s;&s;es were call'd in, one

in the Hou&s;e of Lords; and their Evidence
there being at large &s;et forth, the Reader
is referr'd to the &s;ame. The Evidence of
<HI>Anne Read</HI> is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Anne Read</HI> being a&s;k'd, Whether &s;he had
ever &s;een the Dutche&s;s go to Sir <HI>John Ger|maine</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, and when, &s;ays, That about
<HI>April 1692,</HI> (which was &s;oon after the
Duke's Bill had been rejected in the Hou&s;e
of Lords) &s;he &s;aw the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Norfolk</HI> go
in a Chair to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Hou&s;e; that the
Door was immediately open'd upon her
Chair's being &s;et down, and &s;he went into
the Hou&s;e with her Ma&s;k off.</P>
<P>She being a&s;k'd, Whether &s;he had &s;een
Sir <HI>John</HI> come to the Dutche&s;s's Hou&s;e, and
when; &s;ays, &s;he, within a Twelve-month
la&s;t pa&s;t, or thereabouts, follow'd him to
the Dutche&s;s's Hou&s;e about three of the

<PB N="293" REF="292">
as far as I can apprehend, you call

may be, there cannot be greater) and &s;ince
you are pleas'd to take this Ca&s;e out of the

great deal to be &s;aid to it. We have like|wi&s;e
a good many Witne&s;&s;es to be exa|min'd;
but I am far from propo&s;ing any thing
to delay it. We had a Weeks Time
allow'd us in the Hou&s;e of Lords; but that

a Per&s;on from a very worthy Member, gives
us Intelligence, upon Sight of this Cook-Maid,
of a Matter that will defame her;

&s;he was turn'd away for being a common

The&s;e would be Witne&s;&s;es of Credit again&s;t
tho&s;e that are, you &s;ay, not of Credit.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Council.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We have &s;ummon'd them, and
Mrs. <HI>Pitt,</HI> and done all that we could on
our Side, to get them here. And I hope
you won't prejudge our Ca&s;e, to &s;ay they
are in our Intere&s;t; that is to determine
<PB N="296" REF="295">
the Que&s;tion. We have likewi&s;e &s;ummon'd
Mrs. <HI>Pitt,</HI> and her two Maids, and whether
they will appear or not, that we cannot
tell; but this we are ready to make out to
you.</P>

<P><HI>Su&s;anna Barrington,</HI> the
Dutche&s;s's Woman, privy to the whole Con|ver&s;ation,
is prov'd to have been with her
&s;ince the Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e
of Lords.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>A Member.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether he has one living
Witne&s;s to produce, that he can make good
his Defence by?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you expect an
An&s;wer from me, I am a&s;&s;ur'd, that we
have Witne&s;&s;es; but if I cannot bring tho&s;e
People again&s;t them&s;elves; if I cannot bring
<HI>Nichola</HI> again&s;t <HI>Nichola,</HI> I di&s;pair of doing
any Good, if I bring a thou&s;and other Wit|ne&s;&s;es
again&s;t him. And therefore I pray
this Favour of you, That &s;ince 'tis your
Plea&s;ure, that this Evidence be not allow'd,
you will not make a bad Con&s;truction of it,
that I do not proceed to make a Defence to
this Bill; for I cannot truly do it, unle&s;s I
had &s;ome other In&s;tructions from my Client,
but &s;hall defeat her Expectation, to proceed
upon the other Part of the Ca&s;e; &s;ince what
we built upon with good Authority, as we
thought, is not thought fit to be admitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwynne.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are at Li|berty
to go on, if you have any Thing more
<PB N="297" REF="296">
to &s;ay, than that you cannot proceed with|out
farther Directions from your Client.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>A Member.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether they have any
Thing to offer in the Defence of the Dutch|e&s;s,
upon the Crime &s;he is charg'd with; for
I believe 'tis a new Thing for the Council,
when their Client is charg'd with a Crime,
to &s;ay, they cannot defend her, unle&s;s they
go and a&s;k whether they &s;hall defend her
or no? If they have any thing to &s;ay in
her Defence, we &s;hall be ready to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwynne.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys,</HI>
have you any thing more to &s;ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but repeat
what I have already &s;aid, That I would be
glad to make the be&s;t Defence this Ca&s;e
may bear; and I may &s;ay, I have defen|ded
it twice with very good Succe&s;s, and
this is a third Time; and I would make
the be&s;t Defence this Ca&s;e would bear now.
And I mu&s;t own to you, that the Cour&s;e of
our Evidence we did propo&s;e to our &s;elves,
is &s;o far broke, by the fir&s;t Determination
you were pleas'd to make, that I cannot
venture upon the re&s;t of the Defence, if &s;o
be your Plea&s;ure be not to admit of this
Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwynne.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You may, by any
Solicitors or Agents, that were pre&s;ent
when the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es were examin'd in the
Hou&s;e of Lords, prove what they &s;wore
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="298" REF="297">
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dodd.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We apprehend you have al|ready
determin'd the Matter, and we can|not
now meddle with it; but if I apprehend
it aright from the Chair, it is your Opi|nion,
That we may produce the Solicitors
and Agents to give an Account of what
was &s;worn in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Now
we are under this Di&s;ability by your De|termination,
That we, relying upon what
you have determin'd again&s;t us, are not
prepar'd with our Solicitors or others, to
give Evidence of that Matter; but in a
little Time they will be able to give you
an Account of what was then &s;worn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Atwood.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems they want to be
taught their Le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>And then the Council withdrew, and
the Committee proceeded upon the Bill,
Clau&s;e by Clau&s;e, and went through it,
and order'd the &s;ame to be reported.</P>
