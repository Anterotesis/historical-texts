<L>A FARMER late, (&s;o country records &s;ay)</L>
<L>From the next market homewards took his way;</L>
<L>When as the bleak un&s;helter'd heath he cro&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Fa&s;t bound by winter in obdurate fro&s;t,</L>
<L>The driving &s;now-&s;torm &s;mote him in his cour&s;e,</L>
<L>High blow'd the North, and rag'd in all its force;</L>
<L>Slow-pac'd and full of years, th' unequal &s;trife</L>
<L>Long time he held, and &s;truggled hard for life;</L>
<L>Vanqui&s;h'd at length, benumb'd in every part,</L>
<L>The very life-blood curdling at his heart,</L>
<L>Torpid he &s;tood, in frozen fetters bound,</L>
<L>Doz'd, reel'd and dropt expiring to the ground.</L>
<L>Haply his dog, by wondrous in&s;tinct fraught</L>
<L>With all the reas'ning attributes of thought,</L>
<L>Saw his &s;ad &s;tate, and to his dying brea&s;t</L>
<L>Clo&s;e cowr'ing, his devoted body pre&s;s'd;</L>
<L>Then howl'd amain for help, till pa&s;&s;ing near,</L>
<L>Some charitable ru&s;tic lent an ear,</L>
<L>Rais'd him from earth, recall'd his flitting breath,</L>
<L>And &s;natch'd him from the icy arms of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the chilling bla&s;t of &s;ecret woe</L>
<L>Checks the &s;oul's genial current in it's &s;low&mdash;</L>
<L>When death-like lethargy arre&s;ts the mind,</L>
<L>Till man forgets all feeling for his kind,</L>
<L>To his cold heart the friendly Mu&s;e can giv$</L>
<L>Warmth and a pul&s;e that forces him to live;</L>
<L>By the &s;weet magic of her &s;cene beguile,</L>
<L>And bend his rigid mu&s;cles to a &s;mile,</L>
<L>Shake his &s;tern brea&s;t with &s;ympathetic fears,</L>
<L>And make his frozen eye-lids melt in tears,</L>
<L>Pur&s;uing &s;till her life-re&s;toring plan,</L>
<L>Till he perceives and owns him&s;elf a man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Warm'd with the&s;e hopes, this night we make appeal</L>
<L>To Briti&s;h hearts&mdash;for they are hearts that feel.</L>

<SPEAKER>WEAZEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>WAS ever gentle traveller, $ince the days of Ro|bin&s;on Cru&s;oe, &s;o put to his &s;hifts, as I Timothy Weazel, Attorney at law? I have lo&s;t my guide, my guide has lo&s;t him&s;elf, and my hor&s;e has ab|&s;conded, with bridle, &s;addle, and all his &s;hoes, &s;ave one he left behind him in a &s;lough. I &s;aw a fellow &s;etting &s;prings for woodcocks, and &s;how'd him &s;ig|nals of di&s;tre&s;s; but the carle ran off at the &s;ight of me, and vani&s;h'd like a Jack O'lantern. If I under|&s;tood the language of birds, there is not one within call to an&s;wer to a que&s;tion; the creatures have got wings, and are too wi&s;e to &s;tay in &s;uch a place.&mdash;Hold, hold! I &s;ee a hut, or a hovel, or a Laplan|der's lodge, behind the&s;e trees; and here comes one hobbling upon two &s;hanks and a crutch, a proper &s;ample of the &s;oil &s;he withers in&mdash;Holloa! Dame,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
do you hear? Give me a word with you, if your &s;en&s;es can afford it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Dame <HI>DUNCKLEY</HI> enters.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have with me? What is your bu&s;ine&s;s here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your'e right, it mu&s;t be bu&s;ine&s;s; no|body would come here for plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor is this a hou&s;e of call for tra|vellers.</P>

<P>There's no &s;uch per&s;on here, &s;o you may go your ways, before my ma&s;ter &s;ends you packing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a ma&s;ter, have you? Call him out then, and let him direct me in my road to Roderick Penruddock, E&s;quire, and I'll reward him for his pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll reward my ma&s;ter! Saucy com|panion! If Roderick Penruddock is the gentleman you want, you need not go any further&mdash;there he lives.</P>

<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you lie, I believe. Penruddock in that cottage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Will you face me out, who have liv'd with him the&s;e twenty years? And what if it be but a cottage? Content is every thing; my good ma&s;ter is not proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Melancholy, I &s;hou'd think, if a con|&s;tant memorandum of mortality can make him &s;o.&mdash;He was cro&s;s'd in love in his younger days.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if he will not welcome the good news I bring him, he mu&s;t be a philo&s;opher indeed. I'll begin my approaches cautiou&s;ly, however&mdash;the door is fa&s;t&mdash;I'll touch it tenderly.&mdash;Within there!

<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear you. What is it you want?</P>

<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave, I want a few words with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Send 'em in at the window then, and the fewer the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bring you news out of Cornwall; news of great con&s;equence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are you, and what are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Timothy Weazel, of Le&s;twithiel, attor|ney at law, and agent to Sir George Penruddock: let me into your hou&s;e.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a &s;urly humor; here's a pretty freak of Fortune, to pile bags of money on the back o$ an a&s;s, who only kicks again&s;t the burthen; I warrant, if the &s;ky rain'd gold, this churl would not hold out his di&s;h to catch it; but we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee what &s;tuff his philo&s;ophy is made of; good chance
<PB N="4" REF="7">
if I don't &s;hake his metaphy&s;ics out of him ere long. O ho! I've bol$ed him, however.&mdash;Zooks! What a heathen philo&s;opher it is.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>PENRUDDOCK <HI>appears.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Mr. Attorney, what have you to &s;ay, for thus di&s;turbing my whole family? What have I done, or the poor cat, my peaceable com|panion, that thus the boi&s;terous knuckles of the law &s;hou'd mar our meditations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, I was compell'd to make &s;ome little noi&s;e; your ca&s;tle is but &s;mall&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its big enough for my ambition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pa&s;&s;ing &s;olitary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you had &s;uffer'd it to be &s;ilent too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;aith, Sir, if I knew how to be heard without a &s;ound, I would gratify your wi&s;h; but if your &s;ilence &s;uffers by my news, I hope your happi|ne&s;s will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happine&s;s! What's that? I am content, I enjoy tranquillity; Heaven be thank'd, I have nothing to do with happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are beyond me, Sir. If an humble fortune and this poor cottage give you con|tent, perhaps great riches and a &s;plendid hou&s;e wou'd not add to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain your meaning, friend: I don't under&s;tand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In plain words, then, you are to know, that your rich relation, Sir George Penruddock, is deceas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>De&s;unct; gone to his ance&s;tors; whipp'd away by the &s;udden &s;troke of an apoplexy; this mo|ment here, Heaven knows where the next: Death will do it when he likes, and how he likes; I need not remind you, Sir, who are &s;o learned a philo&s;o|pher, how frail the tenure of mortality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not, indeed: If Sir George thought as &s;eriou&s;ly of death before it happened, it
<PB N="5" REF="8">
may have been well for him; but his thoughts, I fear, were otherwi&s;e employed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I much doubt if he ever thought at all; he was a fine gentleman, and liv'd freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder then he died &s;uddenly&mdash;but how does this apply to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No otherwi&s;e than as you are the heir of every thing he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd: I have the will in &s;afe keeping about me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience; this is &s;omewhat &s;udden; I am unprepar'd for &s;uch an event; 'twas never in my contemplation: I was in no habits with Sir George, never courted him, never corre&s;ponded with him; the &s;mall annuity, 'tis true, on which I have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, was charg'd on his e&s;tate, and re|gularly paid, but here he never came; man cou'd not be more oppo&s;ite to man; he wor&s;hipp'd For|tune, I de&s;pis'd her; I &s;tudied clo&s;ely, he gam'd in|ce&s;&s;antly&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And won abundantly&mdash;if money be your pa&s;&s;ion, you'll find plenty of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;hou'd I do with money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money indeed!&mdash;why money is&mdash;in &s;hort, what is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not health methinks, not life&mdash;for he that had it, died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you that have it, live&mdash;and is there nothing that can tempt you? Recollect&mdash;books&mdash;money will buy books; nay more, it will buy tho&s;e who write them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'T will purcha&s;e panegyrics, odes, and dedications&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have all tho&s;e: what el&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, you &s;urely can't forget there are &s;uch things in this world as beauty, love, irre|&s;i&s;tible woman&mdash;</P>
<STAGE>[Dame <HI>DUNCKLEY</HI> cro&s;&s;es the &s;tage.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I keep a woman; &s;he vi&s;its me every
<PB N="6" REF="9">
day, makes my bed, &s;weeps my hou&s;e, cooks my dinner, and is &s;eventy years of age&mdash;yet I re&s;i&s;t her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could &s;ay &s;omething to that, but I am afraid it will offend you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say on boldly; never fear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sir, I find you of a very different temper from what I expected: I &s;hould doubt if your philo&s;ophy has made you in&s;en&s;ible; I am &s;ure it has not made you proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as proud in my nature as any man ought to be, but &s;urely as humble as any man can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suffer me then to a&s;k you if there is not a certain lady living, Arabella Woodville by name, whom you once thought irre&s;i&s;tible, and who even now perhaps might put your philo&s;ophy to a harder trial than the old dame of &s;eventy, who does the drudgery of your cottage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you this? how came you thus to &s;trike upon a name, that twenty years of &s;olitude have not effac'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I wou'd prepare you for a ta&s;k, that with the fortune you inherit mu&s;t devolve upon you. The intere&s;ts of this lady, perhaps even her exi&s;tence, are now in your hands. When I &s;hall deliver the deeds bequeath'd to you by your cou&s;in, I &s;hall arm you with the means of extingui&s;hing the wretched Woodville at a blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you tell me? Have a care how you rever&s;e my nature with a word. Wood|ville in my power! Woodville at my mercy! If there's a man on earth, that can in&s;pire me with revenge, it is that treacherous, ba&s;e, deceitful rival. I was in his power, for I lov'd him&mdash;he betray'd me; I was at his mercy, for I tru&s;ted him&mdash;he de|&s;troy'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then you'll own that money can give &s;omething, for it gives revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come on; my mind is made up to this fortune; to the extreme&s;t atom I'll exact it all: the

<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I am, but there's no rea&s;oning about friend&s;hip; when I &s;ee a fellow, whom I love, throw away his happine&s;s, game away his fortune, and then run from the ruin he has made, I have a fooli&s;h nature about me, that in &s;pite of all his phrenzy will run after him; and tho' he may break loo&s;e from all the world be&s;ide, damn me if he &s;hall &s;hake off me, tho' he had twenty pi&s;tols in his reach, and I not one in mine.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely; I care little about the wel|come that you give me, as I am not quite &s;ure you are the man I was in &s;earch of: my friend was a gentleman, tho' an unwi&s;e one; he would hear rea|&s;on, though he was unapt to follow it; above all things he was not that frantic de&s;perado, as to turn his pi&s;tol either again&s;t his &s;ervant or him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I don't know if I &s;hall &s;ay any thing to you; certainly nothing to &s;ooth you. It is not becau&s;e a man has pi&s;tols in his pocket, that he is formidable, or that I &s;hould flatter him: every fellow, that has not &s;pirit to face misfortune, may be his own a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; every wretch, who has lo&s;t all feelings of humanity, may commit a murder on his fellow-creature.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you that at once&mdash;Sir George Penruddock, my chief creditor, is dead; he has be|queath'd his fortune to his cou&s;in Roderick of that name. This man inhabits a &s;mall tenement here clo&s;e at hand; a &s;trange &s;eque&s;ter'd creature, bury|ing him&s;elf among&s;t his books, di&s;gu&s;ted with the world, and probably a perfect mi&s;anthrope&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<P>I've heard of him; go on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Roderick and I were &s;chool-fellows, &s;tudied together at the univer&s;ity, travell'd together thro' mo&s;t parts of Europe; and were in&s;eparable friends, till by evil chance, we became rivals in love: I obtain'd Mrs. Woodville's hand, and marri|ed her; he was excluded, and renounced &s;ociety: This man, the bittere&s;t enemy I have, is now the ma&s;ter of my fate.</P>

<P>I much doubt if any thing can be fair, when one party has ju&s;t gained a fortune, and the other lo&s;t one: however, if you mean it &s;hou'd be fair, take me with you; whether you &s;hake hands or exchange &s;hots, I will &s;ee ju&s;tice done on both &s;ides; for I will be bold to ave$, there never yet was an affair, in which I had the honour to be either principal or &s;econd, where equity was not as &s;trictly admini&s;ter'd, as if my Lord Chancellor had decreed it from the bench.</P>

<P>Be it &s;o then, if &s;o it mu&s;t be: Come with me to this newly-enrich'd cottager, and if I fail in this la&s;t effort, I exact from you an honourable &s;e|crecy and an immediate &s;ece&s;&s;ion. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>If you, Mr. Penruddock, can find no mo|tive to forgive the wrongs I did you in the matter of my marriage, I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t none, neither will I offer at one word in mitigation of tho&s;e wrongs; they were as great as you believe them; greater, perhaps, than you are perfectly apprized of. In the fir&s;t glow of your re&s;entment you demanded &s;a|tisfaction; in ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t own that your appeal

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of its purport but by con|jecture; 'twas written by Arabella &s;ince &s;he heard of his acce&s;&s;$on to the fortune of Sir George, and
<PB N="13" REF="16">
probably contains a &s;trong appeal to his feelings, founded upon pa&s;t connections; I have rea&s;on to believe it chiefly points at my &s;on, who has &s;o long been a pri&s;oner in France, and now at la&s;t has got his liberty upon exchange; but I dare &s;ay this churl is &s;teel'd again&s;t humanity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all unrea&s;onable, for your mother was a miracle of patience; I am &s;ure I put it very &s;ufficiently to the trial: why I took her with no other view but as we take a diet-drink in the &s;pring, to &s;weeten the juices. Tempe&s;t, the &s;on of Lord Hurricane, was never born to be calm; '&s;blood and fire! I have never been in &s;mooth water &s;ince fir&s;t I was launch'd upon the &s;urface of the globe. I was a younger &s;on, and kick'd into the world with|out

a &s;ixpence; my father gave me no education, taught me nothing, kept me in ignorance, and buf|feted me every day for being a dunce.</P>

<P>That's a wipe at me, I &s;uppo&s;e, but no matter&mdash;Fir&s;t I was turn'd into the army, there I got broken bones and empty pockets; then I was bani&s;hed to the coa&s;t of Africa, to govern the &s;a|vages of Senegambia; there I made a few blunders in colour, by taking whites for blacks and blacks for whites; but before my enemies could get hold of me, Death laid hands upon them, and I triumphed over their malice by the mortality of the climate.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't complain of Fortune in my ca&s;e; perhaps the be&s;t fortune that can befal me is, that I have nothing to do with her: having little to be&s;tow, I make up for it with good will; had I abundance to give, the good-will might be want|ing.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Fortune, however, wou'd but put you to the trial, I &s;hou'd not tremble for the i&s;&s;ue of it. Had Penruddock made you his heir, happy wou'd it have been for poor Woodville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>For him (to own the truth to you) I have very little compa&s;&s;ion; &s;ome old habits of good fel|low&s;hip perhaps I can't quite &s;hake off; but a game&s;ter is in nature &s;uch a fool, in character &s;o lit|tle of a gentleman, and by profe&s;&s;ion &s;o very clo&s;e approaching towards a highwayman, that I am a&s;ham'd of his acquaintance; yet, for my dear Mrs. Woodville's &s;ake, for my brave Henry's &s;ake, and through them, by implication, for my &s;weet Emi|ly's, I have &s;helter'd that poor worthle&s;s de&s;perado in my lodgings; which is a &s;ecret you mu&s;t keep clo&s;e and inviolable as your own purity.</P>
</SP>

<P>Doubt me not, for I can well &s;uppo&s;e the con&s;equences would be fatal. In one word, is there any hope for him?</P>

<P>That I can't tell; for &s;o many people are mad, who yet have &s;en&s;es enough to conceal it, that he may be &s;o without my di&s;covering it. He is as &s;ullen as a bear, and inveterate again&s;t Woodville to th&egrave; length of any &s;pecies of revenge.</P>

<L>Heads down, heels over, whirl'd and whi&s;k'd about,</L>
<L>No wonder if their &s;hallow wits ran out;</L>
<L>Gigg'd by their neighbours, gull'd of all their ca&s;h,</L>
<L>Down comes Sir GILES and Co. with thund'ring cra&s;h.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who &s;ays that Fortune's blind? &s;he has quicker &s;ight</L>
<L>Than mo&s;t of tho&s;e on whom her favours light;</L>
<L><PB REF="70">
For why does &s;he enrich the weak and vain,</L>
<L>But that her ventures may come home again?</L>
<L>Pa&s;s'd thro' like quick&s;ilver, they lo&s;e no weight</L>
<L>Nor value in their loco-motive &s;tate;</L>
<L>No &s;top, no &s;tay; &s;o fa&s;t her clients follow,</L>
<L>Ere one mouth &s;huts, another gap$s to &s;wallow;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t like a conjurer's ball&mdash;pre&s;to! be gone!</L>
<L>The pill that &s;erv'd Sir GILES, now &s;erves Sir JOHN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Sir EUSTACE had a fair and lovely wife,</L>
<L>"Form'd to adorn and ble&s;s the nuptial life,</L>
<L>"Fortune's be&s;t gift in her be&s;t giving mood,</L>
<L>"Sir EUSTACE made that bad which Heav'n made "good,</L>
<L>"Ba&s;ely allur'd her into Folly's cour&s;e,</L>
<L>"Then curs'd his fate and &s;ued out a divorce.</L>
<L>"Unju&s;t, at Fortune's cruelty to rail,</L>
<L>"When we make all the mi&s;eries we bewail."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! generous patrons, on who&s;e breath depends</L>
<L>The fortune of the Mu&s;e, and us, her friends,</L>
<L>If, in your grace, this night you &s;hall be&s;tow</L>
<L>One &s;prig of laurel for your Poet's brow,</L>
<L>Impart to me your flattering commands,</L>
<L>And &s;ign them with the plaudit of your hands.</L>
