<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD the obligations which I owe to
your Lord&s;hip's kindne&s;s been much le&s;s,
or much fewer, than they are; had per|&s;onal
gratitude left any place in my mind
for deliberation or for enquiry; in &s;elect|ing
a name which every reader might
confe&s;s to be prefixed, with propriety, to
a work, that, in many of its parts, bears
no ob&s;cure relation to the general prin|ciples
of natural and revealed religion, I
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
&s;hould have found my&s;elf directed by
many con&s;iderations to that of the Bi&s;hop
of Carli&s;le. A long life, &s;pent in the mo&s;t
intere&s;ting of all human pur&s;uits, the in|ve&s;tigation
of moral and religious truth,
in con&s;tant and unwearied endeavours to
advance the di&s;covery, communication,
and &s;ucce&s;s of both; a life &s;o occupied,
and arrived at that period which renders
every life venerable, commands re&s;pect
by a title, which no virtuous mind will
di&s;pute, which no mind &s;en&s;ible of the
importance of the&s;e &s;tudies to the &s;u|preme
concernments of mankind, will
not rejoice to &s;ee acknowledged. What|ever
difference, or whatever oppo&s;ition,
&s;ome, who peru&s;e your Lord&s;hip's writ|ings,
may perceive between your conclu|&s;ions
and their own, the good and wi&s;e of
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
all per&s;ua&s;ions will revere that indu&s;try,
which has for its object the illu&s;tration
or defence of our common Chri&s;tianity.
Your Lord&s;hip's re&s;earches have never
lo&s;t &s;ight of one purpo&s;e, namely, to re|cover
the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel from
beneath that load of unauthorized addi|tions,
which the ignorance of &s;ome ages,
and the learning of others, the &s;uper&s;ti|tion
of weak, and the craft of de&s;igning
men, have unhappily for its intere&s;t
heaped upon it. And this purpo&s;e, I am
convinced, was dictated by the pure&s;t mo|tive;
by a firm, and, I think, a ju&s;t
opinion, that whatever renders religion
more rational, renders it more credible;
that he, who, by a diligent and faithful
examination of the original records, di&s;|mi&s;&s;es
from the &s;y&s;tem one article, which
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
contradicts the apprehen&s;ion, the experi|ence,
or the rea&s;oning of mankind, does
more towards recommending the belief,
and, with the belief, the influence of
Chri&s;tianity, to the under&s;tandings and
con&s;ciences of &s;erious enquirers, and
through them to univer&s;al reception and
authority, than can be effected by a
thou&s;and contenders for creeds and or|dinances
of human e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>When the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;|tian
world, it was not without the in|du&s;try
of learned men that it came at
length to be di&s;covered, that no &s;uch
doctrine was contained in the New Te&s;|tament.
But had tho&s;e excellent per|&s;ons
done nothing more by their di&s;co|covery,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
than aboli&s;hed an innocent &s;u|per&s;tition,
or changed &s;ome directions in
the ceremonial of public wor&s;hip, they
had merited little of that veneration,
with which the gratitude of prote&s;tant
churches contemplates their &s;ervices. What
they did for mankind was this, they ex|onerated
Chri&s;tianity of a weight which
&s;unk it. If indolence or timidity had
checked the&s;e exertions, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
the fruit and publication of the&s;e enqui|ries,
is it too much to affirm, that infi|delity
would at this day have been uni|ver&s;al?
I do not mean, my Lord, by
the mention of this example to in&s;inu|ate,
that any popular opinion which
your Lord&s;hip may have encountered,
ought to be compared with tran&s;ub&s;tan|tion,
or that the a&s;&s;urance with which
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
we reject that extravagant ab&s;urdity, is
attainable in the controver&s;ies in which
your Lord&s;hip has been engaged; but I
mean, by calling to mind tho&s;e great
reformers of the public faith, to ob&s;erve,
or rather to expre&s;s my own per&s;ua&s;ion,
that to re&s;tore the purity, is mo&s;t effectu|ally
to promote the progre&s;s of Chri&s;ti|anity;
and that the &s;ame virtuous mo|tive,
which hath &s;anctified their labours,
&s;ugge&s;ted yours. At a time when &s;ome
men appear not to perceive any good,
and others to &s;u&s;pect an evil tendency, in
that &s;pirit of examination and re&s;earch
which is gone forth in Chri&s;tian coun|tries,
this te&s;timony is due not only to
the rectitude of your Lord&s;hip's views,
but to the general cau&s;e of intellectual and
religious liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">
That your Lord&s;hip's life may be pro|longed
in health and honour; that it
may afford whil&s;t it continues an in&s;truc|tive
proof, how &s;erene and ea&s;y old age
can be made, by the memory of impor|tant
and well intended labours, by the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of public and de&s;erved e&s;teem,

<PB REF="10">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the treati&s;es that I have met with upon,
the &s;ubject of <HI>morals,</HI> I appear to my&s;elf to
have remarked the following imperfections&mdash;either
that the principle was erroneous, or that it was
indi&s;tinctly explained, or that the rules deduced
from it, were not &s;ufficiently adapted to real life
and to actual &s;ituations. The writings of Grotius,
and the larger work of Puffendorf are of too
<HI>foren&s;ic</HI> a ca&s;t, too much mixed up with the civil
law, and with the juri&s;prudence of Germany, to
an&s;wer preci&s;ely the de&s;ign of a &s;y&s;tem of ethics&mdash;
<PB N="ii" REF="11">
the direction of private con&s;ciences in the gene|ral
conduct of human life. Perhaps, indeed, they
are not to be regarded, &s;o much as in&s;titutes of
morality, calculated to in&s;truct an individual in
his duty, as a &s;pecies of law books and law autho|rities,
&s;uited to the practice of tho&s;e courts of ju&s;|tice,
who&s;e deci&s;ions are regulated by certain
general principles of natural equity combined with
the maxims of the Roman code: of which kind,
I under&s;tand, there are many upon the continent.
To which may be added, concerning both the&s;e
authors, that they are more occupied in de&s;crib|ing
the rights and u&s;ages of independent commu|nities,
than is nece&s;&s;ary in a work which profe&s;&s;es
not to adju&s;t the corre&s;pondence of nations, but
to delineate the offices of dome&s;tic life. The
profu&s;ion al&s;o of cla&s;&s;ical quotations, with which
many of their pages abound, &s;eems to me a fault
from which it will not be ea&s;y to excu&s;e them.
If the&s;e extracts be intended as decorations of
&s;tyle, the compo&s;ition is overloaded with orna|ments
of one kind. To any thing more than
<PB N="iii" REF="12">
ornament they can make no claim. To propo&s;e
them as &s;erious arguments; gravely to attempt
to e&s;tabli&s;h or fortify a moral duty by the te&s;ti|mony
of a Greek or Roman poet, is to trifle with
the attention of the reader, or rather to take it
off from all ju&s;t principles of rea&s;oning in morals.</P>
<P>Of our own writers in this branch of philo&s;ophy,
I find none that I think perfectly free from the
three objections which I have &s;tated. There is like|wi&s;e
a fourth property ob&s;ervable in almo&s;t all of
them, namely, that they divide too much the law of
nature from the precepts of revelation; &s;ome au|thors
indu&s;triou&s;ly declining the mention of &s;crip|ture
authorities, as belonging to a different province,
and others re&s;erving them for a &s;eparate volume:
which appears to me much the &s;ame defect, as if
a commentator on the laws of England &s;hould
content him&s;elf with &s;tating upon each head the
common law of the land, without taking any no|tice
of acts of parliament; or &s;hould chu&s;e to
give his readers the common law in one book,
<PB N="iv" REF="13">
and the &s;tatute law in another. &startq;When the obli|gations
of morality are taught,&endq; &s;ays a pious and
celebrated writer, &startq;let the &s;anctions of Chri&s;tia|nity
never be forgotten; by which it will be
&s;hewn that they give &s;trength and lu&s;tre to each
other; religion will appear to be the voice of rea|&s;on,
and morality the will of God.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Preface to the Preceptor, by Dr. John&s;on.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>manner,</HI> al&s;o, in which modern writers
have treated of &s;ubjects of morality, is, in my
judgment, liable to much exception. It has be|come
of late a fa&s;hion to deliver moral in&s;titutes
in &s;trings or &s;eries of detached propositions, with|out
&s;ubjoining a continued argument or regular
di&s;&s;ertation to any of them. This &s;ententious,
apothegmatizing &s;tyle, by crowding propo&s;itions
and paragraphs too fa&s;t, upon the mind, and by
carrying the eye of the reader from &s;ubject to &s;ub|ject
in too quick a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, gains not a &s;uffi|cient
hold upon the attention, to leave either the
memory furni&s;hed, or the under&s;tanding &s;atisfied.
<PB N="v" REF="14">
However u&s;eful a &s;yllabus of topics, or a &s;eries
of propo&s;itions may be in the hands of a lecturer,
or as a guide to a &s;tudent, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to con|&s;ult
other books, or to in&s;titute upon each &s;ubject
re&s;earches of his own, the method is by no means
convenient for ordinary readers; becau&s;e few
readers are &s;uch <HI>thinkers</HI> as to want only a hint
to &s;et their thoughts at work upon; or &s;uch as
will pau&s;e and tarry at every propo&s;ition, till they
have traced out its dependency, proof, relation,
and con&s;equences, before they permit them&s;elves
to &s;tep on to another. A re&s;pectable writer of this
cla&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fergu&s;on, author of &startq;In&s;titutes of Moral Philo&s;ophy,&endq; 1767.</NOTE> has comprized his doctrine of &s;lavery in
the three following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>&startq;No one is born a &s;lave, becau&s;e every one is
born with all his original rights.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No one can become a &s;lave, becau&s;e no one
from being a per&s;on can, in the language of the
Roman law, become a thing, or &s;ubject of pro|perty.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="15">
&startq;The &s;uppo&s;ed property of the ma&s;ter in the
&s;lave, therefore, is matter of u&s;urpation, not of
right.&endq;</P>
<P>It may be po&s;&s;ible to deduce from the&s;e few
adages &s;uch a theory of the primitive rights of
human nature, as will evince the illegality of &s;la|very;
but &s;urely an author requires too much of
his reader, when he expects him to make the&s;e
deductions for him&s;elf? or to &s;upply, perhaps,
from &s;ome remote chapter of the &s;ame treati&s;e,
the &s;everal proofs and explanations, which are
nece&s;&s;ary to render the meaning and truth of the&s;e
a&s;&s;ertions intelligible.</P>
<P>There is a fault, the oppo&s;ite of this, which
&s;ome morali&s;ts who have adopted a different, and,
I think, a better plan of compo&s;ition, have not
always been careful to avoid; namely, the dwel|ling
upon verbal and elementary di&s;tinctions, with
a labour and prolixity, proportioned much more
to the &s;ubtlety of the que&s;tion, than to its value
<PB N="vii" REF="16">
and importance in the pro&s;ecution of the &s;ubject.
A writer upon the law of nature,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Rutherforth, author of &startq;In&s;titutes of Natural Law.&endq;</NOTE> who&s;e expli|cations
in every part of philo&s;ophy, though al|ways
diffu&s;e, are often very &s;ucce&s;sful, has em|ployed
three long &s;ections in endeavouring to
prove, that, &startq;permi&s;&s;ions are not laws.&endq; The
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this controver&s;y, however e&s;&s;ential it
might be to dialectic preci&s;ion, was certainly not
nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s of a work de&s;igned to
de&s;cribe the duties and obligations of civil life.
The reader becomes impatient when he is detained
by di&s;qui&s;itions which have no other object than
the &s;ettling of terms and phra&s;es? and, what is
wor&s;e, they, for who&s;e u&s;e &s;uch books are chiefly
intended, will not be per&s;uaded to read them at
all.</P>
<P>I am led to propo&s;e the&s;e &s;trictures, not by any
propen&s;ity to depreciate the labours of my predece&s;|&s;ors,
much le&s;s to invite a compari&s;on between the
merits of their performances and my own, but &s;olely
<PB N="viii" REF="17">
by the con&s;ideration, that, when a writer offers a
book to the public upon a &s;ubject, in which the
public are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many others,
he is bound by a kind of literary ju&s;tice, to in|form
his readers di&s;tinctly and &s;pecifically, what
it is he profe&s;&s;es to &s;upply, and what he expects to
improve. The imperfections above enumerated are
tho&s;e which I have endeavoured to avoid or remedy.
Of the execution the reader mu&s;t judge, but this
was the de&s;ign. Concerning the <HI>principle</HI> of mo|rals
it would be premature to &s;peak; but concern|ing
the manner of unfolding and explaining that
principle, I have &s;omewhat which I wi&s;h to be
remarked. An experience of nine years in the
office of a public tutor in one of the univer&s;ities,
and in that department of education to which
the&s;e chapters relate, afforded me frequent occa&s;ion
to ob&s;erve, that, in di&s;cour&s;ing to young minds
upon topics of morality, it required much more
pains to make them perceive the difficulty, than
to under&s;tand the &s;olution; that, unle&s;s the &s;ub|ject
was &s;o drawn up to a point, as to pre&s;ent the
<PB N="ix" REF="18">
full force of an objection, or the exact place of a
doubt, before any explanation was entered upon;
in other words, unle&s;s &s;ome curio&s;ity was excited
before it was attempted to be &s;ati&s;fied, the labour
of the teacher was lo&s;t. When information was
not reque&s;ted, it was &s;eldom, I found, retained.
I have made this ob&s;ervation my guide in the fol|lowing
work; that is, upon each occa&s;ion I have
endeavoured, before I &s;uffered my&s;elf to proceed
in the di&s;qui&s;ition, to put the reader in complete
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the que&s;tion; and to do it in the way
that I thought mo&s;t likely to &s;tir up his own doubts
and &s;olicitude about it.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing the principle of morals through the
detail of ca&s;es to which it is applicable, I have had
in view to accommodate both the choice of the
&s;ubjects, and the manner of handling them, to the
&s;ituations which ari&s;e in the life of an inhabitant
of this country, in the&s;e times. This is the thing
that I think to be principally wanting in former
treati&s;es, and, perhaps, the chief advantage which
<PB N="viii" REF="19">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="ix" REF="20">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="x" REF="21">
will be found in mine. I have examined no
doubts, I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed no ob&s;curities, I have en|countered
no errors, I have adverted to no con|trover&s;ies,
but what I have &s;een actually to
exi&s;t. If &s;ome of the que&s;tions treated of appear
to a more in&s;tructed reader minute or puerile,
I de&s;ire &s;uch reader to be a&s;&s;ured that I have
found them occa&s;ions of difficulty to young
minds; and what I have ob&s;erved in young minds,
I &s;hould expect to meet with in all who approach
the&s;e &s;ubjects for the fir&s;t time. Upon each
article of human duty, I have combined with the
conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on, the declarations of &s;cripture,
when they are to be had, as of co-ordinate
authority, and as both terminating in the &s;ame
&s;anctions.</P>
<P>In the <HI>manner</HI> of the work, I have endeavoured
&s;o to temper the oppo&s;ite plans above animadverted
upon, as that the reader may not accu&s;e me
either of too much ha&s;te, or of too much delay.
I have be&s;towed upon each &s;ubject enough of di&s;|&s;ertation
<PB N="xi" REF="22">
to give a body and &s;ub&s;tance to the chap|ter
in which it is treated of, as well as coherence
and per&s;picuity; on the other hand, I have &s;el|dom,
I hope, exerci&s;ed the patience of the reader
by the length and prolixity of my e&s;&s;ays, or di&s;|appointed
that patience at la&s;t, by the tenuity and
unimportance of the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>There are two particulars in the following
work for which it may be thought nece&s;&s;ary that
I &s;hould offer &s;ome excu&s;e. The fir&s;t of which
is, that I have &s;carcely ever referred to any other
book, or mentioned the name of the author who&s;e
thoughts, and &s;ometimes, po&s;&s;ibly, who&s;e very
expre&s;&s;ions I have adopted. My method of writ|ing
has con&s;tantly been this; to extract what I
could from my own &s;tores, and my own reflec|tions
in the fir&s;t place; to put down that; and
afterwards to con&s;ult upon each &s;ubject &s;uch read|ing
as fell in my way: which order, I am con|vinced,
is the only one whereby any per&s;on can
keep his thoughts from &s;liding into other men's
<PB N="xii" REF="23">
trains. The effect of &s;uch a plan upon the pro|duction
it&s;elf will be, that whil&s;t &s;ome parts in
matter or manner may be new, others will be
little el&s;e than a repetition of the old. I make
no preten&s;ions to perfect originality: I claim to be
&s;omething more than a mere compiler. Much
no doubt is borrowed; but the fact is, that the
notes for this work having been prepared for
&s;ome years; and &s;uch things having been from
time to time in&s;erted in them, as appeared to me
worth preserving; and &s;uch in&s;ertions having been
made, commonly, without the name of the author
from whom they were taken, I &s;hould, at this
time, have found a difficulty in recovering the&s;e
names with &s;ufficient exactne&s;s to be able to ren|der
to every man his own. Nor, to &s;peak the
truth, did it appear to me worth while to repeat
the &s;earch merely for this purpo&s;e. When autho|rities
are relied upon, names mu&s;t be produced:
when a di&s;covery has been made in &s;cience, it may
be unju&s;t to borrow the invention, without ac|knowledging
<PB N="xiii" REF="24">
the author. But in an argumentative
treati&s;e, and upon a &s;ubject, which allows no
place for di&s;covery or invention, properly &s;o cal|ed;
and in which all that can belong to a writer
is his mode of rea&s;oning, or his judgment of pro|babilities;
I &s;hould have thought it &s;uperfluous,
had it been ea&s;ier to me than it was, to have in|terrupted
my text, or crouded my margin with
references to every author, who&s;e &s;entiments I have
made u&s;e of. There is, however, one work to
which I owe &s;o much, that it would be ungrate|ful
not to confe&s;s the obligation; I mean the writ|ings
of the late Abraham Tucker, E&s;&abque; part of
which were publi&s;hed by him&s;elf, and the remain|der
&s;ince his death, under the title of &startq;The Light
of Nature pur&s;ued, by Edward Search, E&s;q.&endq; I
have found in this writer more original thinking
and ob&s;ervation upon the &s;everal &s;ubjects that
he has taken in hand, than in any other, not to &s;ay,
than in all others put together. His talent al&s;o for
illu&s;tration is unrivalled. But his thoughts are
<PB N="xiv" REF="25">
diffu&s;ed through a long, various, and irregular
work. I &s;hall account it no mean prai&s;e, if I
have been &s;ometimes able to di&s;po&s;e into method,
to collect into heads and articles, or to exhibit
in more compact and tangible ma&s;&s;es, what, in
that otherwi&s;e excellent performance, is &s;pread
over too much &s;urface.</P>
<P>The next circum&s;tance for which &s;ome apology
may be expected, is the joining of moral and poli|tical
philo&s;ophy together, or the addition of a book
of politics to a &s;y&s;tem of ethics. Again&s;t this
objection, if it be made one, I might defend my|&s;elf
by the example of many approved writers, who have treated, <HI>de officiis hominis et civis,</HI> or, as
&s;ome chu&s;e to expre&s;s it, &startq;of the rights and obli|gations
of man, in his individual and &s;ocial capa|city,&endq;
in the &s;ame book. I might alledge al&s;o, that
the part a member of the commonwealth &s;hall take
in political contentions, the vote he &s;hall give, the
coun&s;els he &s;hall approve, the &s;upport he &s;hall afford,
<PB N="xv" REF="26">
or the oppo&s;ition he &s;hall make, to any &s;y&s;tem of
public mea&s;ures, is as much a que&s;tion of per&s;onal
duty, as much concerns the con&s;cience of the indi|vidual,
who deliberates, as the determination of any
doubt which relates to the conduct of private
life; that con&s;equently political philo&s;ophy is,
properly &s;peaking, a continuation of moral phi|lo&s;ophy;
or rather, indeed, a part of it, &s;uppo&s;|ing
moral philo&s;ophy to have for its aim, the in|formation
of the human con&s;cience in every de|liberation
that is likely to come before it. I might
avail my&s;elf of the&s;e excu&s;es, if I wanted them;
but the vindication upon which I rely, is the
following. In &s;tating the principle of morals, the
reader will ob&s;erve, that I have employed &s;ome
indu&s;try in explaining the theory, and &s;hewing
the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>general rules;</HI> without the full
and con&s;tant con&s;ideration of which, I am per|&s;uaded
that no &s;y&s;tem of moral philo&s;ophy can
be &s;atisfactory or con&s;i&s;tent. This foundation be|ing
laid, or rather, this habit being formed, the
<PB N="xvi" REF="27">
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of political &s;ubjects, to which, more
than to almo&s;t any other, general rules are appli|cable,
became clear and ea&s;y. Whereas had the&s;e
topics been a&s;&s;igned to a di&s;tinct work, it would
have been nece&s;&s;ary to have repeated the &s;ame
rudiments, to have e&s;tabli&s;hed over again the
&s;ame principles, as tho&s;e which we had already
exemplified, and rendered familiar to the reader,
in the former parts of this. In a word, if
there appear to any one too great a diver&s;ity,
or too wide a di&s;tance between the &s;ubjects
treated of, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent volume,
let him be reminded, that the doctrine of gene|ral
rules pervades and connects the whole.</P>
<P>It may not be improper, however, to admoni&s;h
the reader, that, under the name of <HI>politics,</HI> he
is not to look for tho&s;e occa&s;ional controver&s;ies,
which the occurrences of the pre&s;ent day, or
any temporary &s;ituation of public affairs may
excite; and mo&s;t of which, if not beneath the
<PB N="xvii" REF="28">
dignity, it is be&s;ide the purpo&s;e of a philo&s;o|phical
in&s;titution to advert to. He will perceive
that the &s;everal di&s;qui&s;itions are framed with a refe|rence
to the condition of this country, and of this
government; but it &s;eemed to me to belong to the
de&s;ign of a work like the following, not &s;o much
to di&s;cu&s;s each altercated point with the particularity
of a political pamphlet upon the &s;ubject, as to deliver
tho&s;e univer&s;al principles, and to exhibit, as well
as I was able, that mode and train of rea&s;oning
in politics, by the due application of which every
man might be enabled to attain to ju&s;t conclu&s;ions
of his own.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant of an objection that has been
advanced again&s;t all ab&s;tract &s;peculations concern|ing
the origin, principle, or limitation of civil
authority, namely, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s little or no
influence upon the conduct either of the &s;tate or
of the &s;ubject, of the governors or the governed;
nor are attended with any u&s;eful con&s;equences to
<PB N="xviii" REF="29">
either; that in times of tranquillity they are not
wanted, in times of confu&s;ion they are never heard.
This repre&s;entation, however, in my opinion, is
not ju&s;t. Times of tumult, it is true, are not
the times to learn; but the election men
make of their &s;ide and party, in the mo&s;t
critical occa&s;ions of the commonwealth, may,
neverthele&s;s, depend upon the le&s;&s;ons they have
received, the books they have read, and the opi|nions
they have imbibed, in &s;ea&s;ons of lei&s;ure and
quietne&s;s. Some judicious per&s;ons, who were
pre&s;ent at Geneva, during the troubles which
lately convul&s;ed that city, thought they perceived,
in the contentions there carrying on, the operation
of that political theory, which the writings of
Rou&s;&s;eau, and the unbounded e&s;teem in which
the&s;e writings are held by his countrymen, had
diffu&s;ed among&s;t the people. Throughout the
political di&s;putes that have within the&s;e few years
taken place in Great Britain, in her &s;i&s;ter kingdom,
and in her foreign dependencies; in the language
<PB N="xix" REF="30">
of party, in the re&s;olutions of popular meetings,
in debate, in conver&s;ation, in the general &s;train of
tho&s;e fugitive and diurnal addre&s;&s;es to the pub|lic,
which &s;uch occa&s;ions call forth, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
not to ob&s;erve the prevalency of tho&s;e
ideas of civil authority which are di&s;played in the
works of Mr. Locke. The credit of that great
name, the courage and liberality of his principles,
the &s;kill and clearne&s;s with which his arguments
are propo&s;ed, no le&s;s than the weight of the argu|ments
them&s;elves, have given a reputation and
currency to his opinions, of which, I am per|&s;uaded,
in any un&s;ettled &s;tate of public affairs,
the influence would be felt. As this is not a
place for examining the truth or tendency of the&s;e
doctrines, I would not be under&s;tood, by what I
have &s;aid, to expre&s;s any judgment concerning
either. I only mean to remark, that &s;uch doc|trines
are not without effect; and that it is of
<HI>practical</HI> importance, to have the principles from
which the obligations of &s;ocial union, and the ex|tent
<PB N="xx" REF="31">
of civil obedience are derived, rightly explained
and well under&s;tood. Indeed, as far as I have
ob&s;erved, in political, beyond all other &s;ubjects,
where men are without &s;ome fundamental and
&s;cientific principles to re&s;ort to, they are liable
to have their under&s;tandings played upon by cant
phra&s;es and unmeaning terms, of which every
party in every country po&s;&s;e&s;s a vocabulary. We
appear a&s;toni&s;hed when we &s;ee the multitude led
away by &s;ounds; but we &s;hould remember, that,
if &s;ounds work miracles, it is always upon igno|rance.
The influence of names is in exact pro|portion
to the want of knowledge.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ob&s;ervations with which I have
judged it expedient to prepare the attention of my
reader. Concerning the per&s;onal motives which
engaged me in the following attempt, it is not
nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;ay much; the nature of my
academical &s;ituation, a great deal of lei&s;ure &s;ince
my retirement from it, the recommendation of an
<PB N="xxi" REF="32">
honoured and excellent friend, the authority of
the venerable prelate to whom the&s;e labours are
in&s;cribed, the not perceiving in what way I could
employ my time or talents better, and my di&s;ap|probation,
in literary men, of that fa&s;tidious indo|lence,
which &s;its &s;till, becau&s;e it di&s;dains to do
<HI>little,</HI> were the con&s;iderations that directed my
thoughts to this de&s;ign. Nor have I repented of
the undertaking. Whatever be the fate or recep|tion
of this work, it owes its author nothing. In
&s;ickne&s;s, and in health, I have found in it that,
which can alone alleviate, the one, or give enjoy|ment
to the other&mdash;occupation and engagement.</P>

<P>MORALITY, Moral Philo&s;ophy, Ethics, Ca&s;ui&s;try,
Natural Law, mean all the &s;ame thing; namely,
<HI>That &s;cience which teaches men their duty and the
rea&s;ons of it.</HI></P>
<P>The u&s;e of &s;uch a &s;tudy depends upon this, that,
without it, the rules of life, by which men are ordinarily
governed, oftentimes mi&s;lead them, thro' a defect either
in the rule, or in the application.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules are, the Law of Honour, the Law of the
Land, and the Scriptures.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="2" REF="40">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Law of Honour.</HEAD>
<P>THE Law of Honour is a &s;y&s;tem of rules con&s;tructed
by people of fa&s;hion, and calculated to facilitate
their intercour&s;e with one another: and for no other pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, nothing is adverted to by the Law of
Honour, but what tends to incommode this intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence this law only pre&s;cribes and regulates the duties
<HI>betwixt equals;</HI> omitting &s;uch as relate to the Supreme
Being, as well as tho&s;e which we owe to our inferiors.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on profanene&s;s; neglect of public wor|&s;hip
or private devotion; cruelty to &s;ervants; rigorous treat|ment
of tenants or other dependants; want of charity to
the poor; injuries done to trade&s;men by in&s;olvency or de|lay
of payment; with numberle&s;s examples of the &s;ame
kind, are accounted no breaches of honour; becau&s;e a
man is not a le&s;s agreeable companion for the&s;e vices, nor
the wor&s;e to deal with, in tho&s;e concerns which are u&s;ually
tran&s;acted between per&s;ons of honour.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="41">
Again, the Law of Honour, being con&s;tituted by men
occupied in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, and for the mutual
convenience of &s;uch men, will be found, as might be ex|pected
from the character and de&s;ign of the law-makers,
to be, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, favourable to the licentious indul|gence
of the natural pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus it allows of fornication, adultery, drunkenne&s;s,
prodigality, duelling, and revenge in the extreme; and
lays no &s;tre&s;s upon the virtues oppo&s;ite to the&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Law of the Land.</HEAD>
<P>THAT part of mankind, who are beneath the Law
of Honour, often make the Law of the Land
their rule of life; that is, they are &s;ati&s;fied with them|&s;elves,
&s;o long as they do or omit nothing, for the doing
or omitting of which the law can puni&s;h them.</P>
<P>Whereas every &s;y&s;tem of human laws, con&s;idered as a
rule of life, labours under the two following defects:</P>
<P>I. Human laws omit many duties, as not objects of
compul&s;ion; &s;uch as piety to God, bounty to the poor,
<PB N="4" REF="42">
forgivene&s;s of injuries, education of children, gratitude to
benefactors, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Law, never &s;peaks but to command, nor commands
but where it can compell; con&s;equently tho&s;e duties,
which by their nature mu&s;t be <HI>voluntary,</HI> are left out of
the &s;tatute book, as lying beyond the reach of it's opera|tion
and authority.</P>
<P>II. Human laws permit, or which is the &s;ame thing,
&s;uffer to go unpuni&s;hed, many crimes, becau&s;e incapable
of being defined by any previous de&s;cription.&mdash;Of which
nature is luxury, prodigality, partiality in voting at tho&s;e
elections, where the qualification of the candidate ought
to determine the succe&s;s&mdash;caprice in the di&s;po&s;ition of
men's fortunes at their death&mdash;di&s;re&s;pect to parents&mdash;and a
multitude of &s;imilar examples.</P>
<P>For this is the alternative; the Law mu&s;t either define,
beforehand, and with preci&s;ion, the offences which it pu|ni&s;hes,
or mu&s;t leave it to the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the magi&s;trate,
to determine upon each particular ca&s;e, whether it con&s;ti|tutes
that offence which the law de&s;igned to puni&s;h, or not;
which is, in effect, leaving it to the magi&s;trate to puni&s;h
or not to puni&s;h, at his plea&s;ure, the individual who is
brought before him&mdash;-which is ju&s;t &s;o much tyranny.
Where, therefore, as in the in&s;tances above-mentioned,
the di&s;tinction between right and wrong is of too &s;ubtle or
too &s;ecret a nature, to be a&s;certained by any preconcerted
<PB N="5" REF="43">
language, the law of mo&s;t countries, e&s;pecially of free
&s;tates, rather than commit the liberty of the &s;ubject to the
di&s;cretion of the magi&s;trate, leaves men in &s;uch ca&s;es to
them&s;elves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER expects to find in the Scriptures, par|ticular
directions for every moral doubt that
ari&s;es, looks for more than he will meet with. And to
what a magnitude &s;uch a detail of particular precepts
would have enlarged the &s;acred volume, may be partly
under&s;tood from hence&mdash;The laws of this country, includ|ing
the acts of the legi&s;lature and the deci&s;ions of our
&s;upreme courts of ju&s;tice, are not contained in fewer than
fifty folio volumes; and yet it is not one time in ten, that
you can find the ca&s;e you look for, in any law-book what|ever;
to &s;ay nothing, of tho&s;e numerous points of conduct,
in which the law does not profe&s;s to pre&s;cribe or determine
any thing.</P>
<P>Had then the &s;ame particularity, which obtains in hu|man
laws, &s;o far as they go, been attempted in the Scrip|tures,
<PB N="6" REF="44">
throughout the whole extent of morality, it is ma|nife&s;t,
they would have been by much too bulky to be
either read or circulated; or rather as St. John &s;ays, &startq;even
the world it&s;elf could not contain the books that &s;hould be
written.&endq;</P>
<P>Morality is taught in Scripture in this wi&s;e&mdash;-General
rules are laid down of piety, ju&s;tice, benevolence, and
purity&mdash;&s;uch as wor&s;hiping God in &s;pirit and in truth&mdash;doing
as we would be done by&mdash;loving our neighbour as
our&s;elf&mdash;forgiving others, as we expect forgivene&s;s from
God&mdash;that mercy is better than sacrifice&mdash;that not that
which entereth into a man, (nor by parity of rea&s;on, any
ceremonial pollutions) but that which proceedeth from the
heart, defileth him. Several of the&s;e rules are occa&s;ionally
illu&s;trated, either in <HI>fictitious examples,</HI> as the parable of
the good Samaritan&mdash;of the cruel &s;ervant, who refu&s;ed to
his fellow-&s;ervant, that indulgence and compa&s;&s;ion which his
ma&s;ter had ju&s;t &s;hewn to him; <HI>or in in&s;tances which actually
pre&s;ented them&s;elves,</HI> as the reproof of his di&s;ciples at the Sa|maritan
village&mdash;-the prai&s;e of the poor widow, who ca&s;t in
her $a&s;t$mite&mdash;the cen&s;ure of the Phari&s;ees, who cho&s;e out the
chief rooms&mdash;and of the tradition, whereby they evaded the
command to su&s;tain their indigent parents&mdash;<HI>or in the re&s;o|lution
of que&s;tions, which tho&s;e about our Saviour propo&s;ed
to him,</HI> as his an&s;wer to the young man who a&s;ked him,
&startq;What lack I yet?&endq; and to the hone&s;t &s;cribe, who had
found out even in that age and country, that to love God
<PB N="7" REF="45">
and his neighbour, was more than all whole burnt offer|ings
and &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>And this is the way in which all practical &s;ciences are
taught, as Arithmetic, Grammar, Navigation, and the like.&mdash;Rules
are laid down, and examples are &s;ubjoined; not that
the&s;e examples are the ca&s;es, much le&s;s all the ca&s;es that
will actually occur, but by way only of explaining the
principle of the rule, and as &s;o many &s;pecimens of the me|thod
of applying it.&mdash;The chief difference is, that the ex|amples
in Scripture are not annexed to the rules, with the
didactic regularity to which we are now-a-days accu&s;tomed,
but delivered di&s;per&s;edly, as particular occa&s;ions &s;ugge&s;ted,
which gave them however, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who heard
them, and were pre&s;ent to the occa&s;ions which produced
them, an energy and per&s;ua&s;ion, much beyond what the
&s;ame, or any in&s;tances would have appeared with, in their
places in a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Scriptures commonly pre&s;uppo&s;e in

it cannot be denied, but that &s;ome &s;orts of actions

approbation of virtue, even in in&s;tances where we
have no intere&s;t of our own to induce us to it, may be
accounted for, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a moral &s;en&s;e;
thus:</P>
<P>Having experienced, in &s;ome in&s;tance, &s;uch a conduct
to be beneficial to our&s;elves, or ob&s;erved that it would be

<P>And this continuance of the pa&s;&s;ion, after the rea&s;on of

This is the ca&s;e, with mo&s;t of us at pre&s;ent; and is the
cau&s;e al&s;o, that <HI>the proce&s;s of a&s;&s;ociation,</HI> de&s;cribed in the
la&s;t paragraph but one, is now-a-days little either perceived
or wanted.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for the continuance and dif|fu&s;ion
of the &s;ame moral &s;entiments among&s;t mankind,
we have mentioned <HI>imitation,</HI> the efficacy of which prin|ciple
is very ob&s;ervable in children: and if there be any
thing in them, which de&s;erves the name of an <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> it is
their <HI>propen&s;ity to imitation;</HI> and there is nothing which
they imitate or apply more readily than expre&s;&s;ions of af|fection
and aver&s;ion, of approbation, hatred, re&s;entment,
and the like.&mdash;And when the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and expre&s;&s;ions are
once connected (which they &s;oon will be) by the &s;ame a&s;|&s;ociation,
which unites words with their ideas; the pa&s;|&s;ion
will follow the expre&s;&s;ion, and attach upon the object
to which the child has been accu&s;tomed to apply the ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
In a word, when almo&s;t every thing el&s;e is
learned by <HI>imitation,</HI> can we wonder to find the &s;ame cau&s;e
concerned in the generation of our moral &s;entiments!</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable objection to the &s;y&s;tem of moral
in&s;tincts is this, that there are no maxims in the &s;cience,
which can well be deemed <HI>innate,</HI> as none perhaps can be
a&s;&s;igned, which are ab&s;olutely and univer&s;ally <HI>true;</HI> in
<PB N="15" REF="53">
other words, which do not <HI>bend</HI> to circum&s;tances. Vera|city,
which &s;eems, if any be, a natural duty, is excu&s;ed
in many ca&s;es towards an enemy, a thief, a madman, or
a child; the obligation of promi&s;es, which is a fir&s;t prin|ciple
in morality, depends upon the circum&s;tances under
which they were made&mdash;they may have been unlawful, or
become &s;o &s;ince, or incon&s;i&s;tent with former promi&s;es, or
erroneous, or extorted; under all which ca&s;es, in&s;tances
may be put, where the obligation to perform the promi&s;e
would be dubious or di&s;charged: and &s;o of mo&s;t other ge|neral
rules, when they come to be actually applied.</P>
<P>There is an argument oil the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion,
of this kind. Together with the in&s;tinct, there mu&s;t have
been implanted al&s;o a clear and preci&s;e idea of the object
upon which it was to attach. The in&s;tinct and the idea of
the object are in&s;eperable even in imagination, and as ne|ce&s;&s;arily
accompany each other as any correlative ideas
whatever: that is, in plainer terms, if we be prompted
by nature to the approbation of particular actions, we mu&s;t
have received al&s;o from nature a di&s;tinct conception of the
action we are thus prompted to approve; which we cer|tainly
have not.</P>
<P>But as this argument bears alike again&s;t all in&s;tincts, and
in brutes as well as in men, it will hardly, I &s;uppose, pro|duce
convinction, though it may be difficult to find an an|&s;wer
to it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="54">
Upon the whole, it &s;eems to me, either that there are
no &s;uch in&s;tincts as compo&s;e what is called the
moral &s;en&s;e, or that they are not now to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from prejudices
and habits; on which account they cannot be depended upon
in moral rea&s;oning: I mean, that it is no &s;afe way of ar|guing,
to a&s;&s;ume certain principles as &s;o many dictates, im|pul&s;es,
and in&s;tincts of nature, and then draw conclu&s;ions
from the&s;e, as to the rectitude or wrongne&s;s of actions, in|dependant
of the tendency of &s;uch actions, or any other
con&s;ideration whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> lays it down, as a fundamental and &s;elf-evident
maxim, that nature intended barbarians to be &s;laves; and
proceeds to deduce from this maxim a train of conclu&s;ions,
calculated to ju&s;tify the policy which then prevailed. And
I que&s;tion whether the &s;ame maxim be not &s;till &s;elf-evident
to the &startq;company of merchants trading to the coa&s;t of Africa.&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o &s;oon made as a maxim; and it appears from
the example of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> that authority and convenience,
education, prejudice, and general practice, have a great
&s;hare in the making of them.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on, I am apt to &s;u&s;pect, that a &s;y&s;tem of
morality, built upon in&s;tincts, will only find out rea&s;ons
and excu&s;es for opinions and practices already e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;will
&s;eldom correct or reform them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="55">
Be&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;e we admit the exi&s;tence of the&s;e in&s;tincts,
what is their authority?&mdash;No man, you &s;ay, can act in de|liberate
oppo&s;ition to them without a &s;ecret remor&s;e of con|&s;cience.&mdash;But
this remor&s;e may be borne with&mdash;and if the
&s;inner chu&s;e to bear with it, for the &s;ake of the plea&s;ure or
profit he expects from his wickedne&s;s; or finds the plea|&s;ure
of the &s;in exceed the remor&s;e of con&s;cience, of which
he alone is the judge, and when he feels them both toge|ther
can hardly be mi&s;taken, the moral-in&s;tinct-man, &s;o
far as I can under&s;tand, has nothing more to &s;ay.</P>
<P>For, if he alledge, that the&s;e in&s;tincts are &s;o many
indications of the will of God, and con&s;equently pre|&s;ages
of what we are to look for hereafter, this, I an|&s;wer,
is to re&s;ort to a rule and a motive, ulterior to the in|&s;tincts
them&s;elves, and at which rule and motive we &s;hall
by and by arrive by a &s;urer road&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>&s;urer,</HI> &s;o long as
there remains a controver&s;y whether there be any in&s;tinc|tive

<P>This celebrated que&s;tion therefore in our &s;y&s;tem becomes

&s;en&s;e, in whatever profu&s;ion or variety they be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;By
the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e I mean, as well the animal gra|tifications
of eating, drinking, and that by which the &s;pe|cies
is continued, as the more refined plea&s;ures of mu&s;ic,
painting, architecture, gardening, &s;plendid &s;hews, theatric

hunting, &s;hooting, fi&s;hing, &amp;c. For,</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> The&s;e plea&s;ures continue but a little while at a
time. This is true of all of them, e&s;pecially of the
gro&s;&s;er &s;ort. Laying a&s;ide the preparation, and the ex|pectation,
<PB N="20" REF="58">
and computing &s;trictly the actual &s;en&s;ation, we
&s;hall be &s;urpri&s;ed to find, how incon&s;iderable a portion of
our time they occupy, how few hours in the four and
twenty they are able to fill up, or enliven.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> The&s;e plea&s;ures, by repetition, lo&s;e their reli&s;h. It
is a property of the machine, for which we know no re|medy,
that the organs, by which we perceive plea&s;ure,
are blunted and benumbed, by being frequently exerci&s;ed
in the &s;ame way. There is hardly any one who has not
found the difference between a gratification, when new,
and when, familiar; or any plea&s;ure which does not be|come
indifferent, as it grows habitual.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> The eagerne&s;s for high and inten&s;e delights takes
away the reli&s;h from all others; and as &s;uch delights fall
rarely in our way, the greater part of our time mu&s;t be
empty and unea&s;y.</P>
<P>There is hardly any delu&s;ion, by which men are greater
&s;ufferers in their happine&s;s, than by their expecting too much
from what is called plea&s;ure; that is, from tho&s;e inten&s;e de|lights,
which vulgarly engro&s;s the name of plea&s;ure. The
very expectation &s;poils them. When they do come, we
are often engaged in taking pains to per&s;uade our&s;elves
how much we are plea&s;ed, rather than enjoying any plea|&s;ure,
which &s;prings naturally out of the object. And
whenever we depend upon being va&s;tly delighted, we
always go home &s;ecretly grieved at mi&s;&s;ing our aim. Like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="21" REF="59">
as hath been ob&s;erved ju&s;t now, when this humour
of being prodigiou&s;ly delighted, has once taken hold of
the imagination, it hinders us from providing for, or ac|quiescing

variety and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of which, are the only things that
can &s;upply any man with a continued &s;tream of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>What I have been able to ob&s;erve of that part of man|kind,

withheld in the pur&s;uit, by no re&s;traints of fortune, or
&s;cruples of con&s;cience, corre&s;ponds &s;ufficiently with this
account. I have commonly remarked in &s;uch men, a
re&s;tle&s;s and inextingui&s;hable pa&s;&s;ion for variety&mdash;a great
part of their time to be vacant, and &s;o much of it irk&s;ome&mdash;and
that, with whatever eagerne&s;s and expectation they
&s;et out, they become by degrees, fa&s;tidious in their choice
of plea&s;ure, languid in the enjoyment, yet mi&s;erable un|der
the want of it.</P>
<P>The truth is, there is a limit, at which the&s;e plea&s;ures

They are in their nature of &s;hort duration, as the organs
cannot hold on their emotions beyond a certain length of

We have &s;aid nothing in this account of the lo&s;s of op|portunities,
or the decay of faculties, which, whenever
they happen, leave the voluptuary, de&s;titute and de&s;perate;
$eazed by de&s;ires that can never be gratified, and the
memory of plea&s;ures which mu&s;t return no more.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be allowed by tho&s;e who have experienced
it, and perhaps by tho&s;e alone, that plea&s;ure which is
purcha&s;ed by the incumbrance of our fortune, is pur|cha&s;ed
too dear; the plea&s;ure never compen&s;ating for the
perpetual irritation of embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The&s;e plea&s;ures, after all, have their value: and, as the
young are always too eager in their pur&s;uit of them, the
old are &s;ometimes too remi&s;s; that is, too &s;tudious of their
ea&s;e, to be at the pains for them, which they really de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Neither does happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in an exemp|tion
from pain, labour, care, bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;u&s;pence, mole&s;|tation,
and &startq;tho&s;e evils which are without;&endq; &s;uch a
&s;tate being attended not with ea&s;e, but with depre&s;&s;ion
of &s;pirits, a ta&s;tele&s;sne&s;s in all our ideas, imaginary anxie|ties,
and the whole train of hypocondriacal affections.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on it &s;eldom an&s;wers their expectations,
to tho&s;e, who retire from their &s;hops and counting-hou&s;es,
to enjoy the remainder of their days in lei&s;ure and tran|quillity;
much le&s;s to &s;uch, as in a fit of chagrin, &s;hut
<PB N="23" REF="61">
them&s;elves up in cloy&s;ters and hermitages, or quit the
world, and their &s;tations in it, for &s;olitude and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Where there is a known external cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, the
cau&s;e may be removed, and the unea&s;ine&s;s will cea&s;e. But
tho&s;e imaginary di&s;tre&s;&s;es which men feel for want of
real ones, (and which are equally tormenting, and &s;o far
equally real) as they depend upon no &s;ingle or a&s;&s;ignable
&s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s, admit oftimes of no application or
relief.</P>
<P>Hence a moderate pain, upon which the attention may
fa&s;ten and &s;pend it&s;elf, is to many a refre&s;hment; as a
fit of the gout will &s;ometimes cure the &s;pleen. And the &s;ame
of any moderate agitation of the mind, as a literary con|trover&s;y,
a law &s;uit, a conte&s;ted election, and above all, gam|ing;
the pa&s;&s;ion for which, in men of fortune and liberal
minds, is to be accounted for on this principle only.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Neither does happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t in greatne&s;s,
rank, or elevated &s;tation.</P>
<P>Were it true that all &s;uperiority afforded plea&s;ure, it
would follow, that, by how much we were the greater, that
is, the more per&s;ons we were &s;uperior to, in the &s;ame pro|portion,
&s;o far as depended upon this cau&s;e, we &s;hould be
the happier; but &s;o it is, that no &s;uperiority yields us any
&s;atisfaction, &s;ave that which we po&s;&s;e&s;s of obtain over tho&s;e
with whom we immediately compare our&s;elves. The &s;hep|herd
<PB N="24" REF="62">
perceives no plea&s;ure in his &s;uperiority over his dog&mdash;the
farmer in his &s;uperiority over the &s;hepherd&mdash;the lord
in his &s;uperiority over the farmer&mdash;nor the king, la&s;tly, in
his &s;uperiority over the lord. Superiority, where there is no
competition, is &s;eldom contemplated&mdash;what mo&s;t men in|deed
are quite uncon&s;cious of.</P>
<P>But if the &s;ame &s;hepherd can run, fight, or wre&s;tle bet|ter
than the pea&s;ants of his village&mdash;if the farmer can &s;how
better cattle, keeps a better hor&s;e, or is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a
longer pur&s;e than any farmer in the Hundred&mdash;if the lord
has more intere&s;t in an election, greater favour at court, a
better hou&s;e, or larger e&s;tate, than any nobleman in the
county&mdash;if the king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a more exten&s;ive territory, a
more powerful fleet or army, a more &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment,
or more loyal &s;ubjects, than any prince in Europe&mdash;in all
the&s;e ca&s;es the parties feel an actual &s;atisfation in their &s;u|periority.</P>
<P>Now the conclu&s;ion that follows from hence is this&mdash;that
the plea&s;ures of ambition, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be
peculiar to high &s;tations, are in reality common to all con|ditions.
The farrier who &s;hoes a hor&s;e better, and is in
greater reque&s;t for his &s;kill than any man within ten miles
of him, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, for all that I can &s;ee, the delight of di&s;|tinction
and of excelling, as really and truly as the &s;tate&s;|man,
the &s;oldier, and the &s;cholar, who have filled Europe
with the reputation of their wi&s;dom, their valour, or their
knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="63">
No &s;uperiority is of any account but &s;uperiority over a
rival. This it is manife&s;t may exi&s;t wherever rival&s;hips
do; and rival&s;hips fall out among&s;t men of all ranks and
degrees. The object of emulation, the dignity or magni|tude
of this object, makes no difference; as it is not what
either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that con&s;titutes the plea&s;ure, but what one
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more than the other.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy &s;miles at the contempt with which the rich
and great &s;peak of the petty &s;trifes and competitions of the
poor; not reflecting that the&s;e &s;trifes and competitions are
ju&s;t as rea&s;onable as their own, and the plea&s;ure, which
&s;ucce&s;s affords, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Our po&s;ition is, that happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in great|ne&s;s.
And this po&s;ition we make out by &s;hewing, that
even what are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the peculiar advantages of
greatne&s;s, the plea&s;ures of ambition and &s;uperiority, are in
reality common to all conditions. But whether the pur|&s;uit
of ambition contribute more to the happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery
of the pur&s;uers is a different que&s;tion; and a que&s;tion
concerning which I entertain great doubt. The plea&s;ure of
&s;ucce&s;s is exqui&s;ite; &s;o al&s;o is the anxiety of the pur&s;uit,
and the pain of di&s;appointment&mdash;and what is the wor&s;t part
of the &s;tory, the plea&s;ure is &s;hort lived. We &s;oon cea&s;e to
look back upon tho&s;e we have left behind; new conte&s;ts
are engaged in, new pro&s;pects unfold them&s;elves; a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of &s;truggles is kept up, whil&s;t there is a rival left
<PB N="26" REF="64">
within the compa&s;s of our views and profe&s;&s;ion; and when
there is none, the plea&s;ure with the pur&s;uit, is at an end.</P>
<P>We have &s;een what happine&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in. We
are next to con&s;ider in what it does con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>In the conduct of life, the great matter is, to know be|fore
hand, what will plea&s;e us, and what plea&s;ures will hold
out. So far as we know this, our choice will be ju&s;tified
by the event. And this knowledge is more &s;carce and dif|ficult
than at fir&s;t &s;ight it may &s;eem to be: for &s;ometimes,
plea&s;ures, which are wonderfully alluring and flattering in
the pro&s;pect, turn out in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion extremely in&s;ipid;
or do not hold out as we expected: at other times plea&s;ures
&s;tart up, which never entered into our calculation; and
which we might have mi&s;&s;ed of by not fore&s;eeing: from
whence we have rea&s;on to believe, that we actually do mi&s;s
of many plea&s;ures from the &s;ame cau&s;e. I &s;ay &startq;know
before hand,&endq; for after the experiment is tried, it is
commonly impracticable to retreat or change; be&s;ides that
&s;hifting and changing is apt to generate a habit of re&s;tle&s;s|ne&s;s,
which is destructive of the happine&s;s of any con|dition.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the original diver&s;ity of ta&s;te, capacity, and
con&s;titution, ob&s;ervable in the human &s;pecies, and the
&s;till greater variety, which habit and fa&s;hion have intro|duced
in the&s;e particulars, it is impo&s;&s;ible to propo&s;e any
<PB N="27" REF="65">
plan of happine&s;s, which will &s;ucceed to all, or any me|thod
of life which is univer&s;ally eligible or practicable.</P>
<P>All that can be &s;aid is, that there remains a pre&s;ump|tion
in favour of tho&s;e conditions, in which men generally
appear mo&s;t chearful and contented. For though the ap|parent
happine&s;s of mankind be not always a true mea&s;ure
of their real happine&s;s, it is the be&s;t mea&s;ure we have.</P>
<P>Taking this for my guide, I am inclined to believe that
happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts,</P>
<P>I. In the exerci&s;e of the &s;ocial affections.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s good &s;pirits, who have
about them many objects of affection and endearment, as
wife, children, kindred, friends. And to the want of
the&s;e may be imputed the peevi&s;hne&s;s of monks, and of
&s;uch as lead the lives of monks.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature with the indulgence of our do|me&s;tic
affections, and equally refre&s;hing to the &s;pirit, is
the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from acts of bounty and bene|ficence,
either in giving money, or imparting to tho&s;e,
who want it, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our &s;kill and profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another main article of Human Happine&s;s is,</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="66">
II. The exerci&s;e of our faculties, either of body or mind,
in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome engaging end.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be true, that no plenitude of pre&s;ent grati|fications
can make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or happy for a continuance,
unle&s;s he have &s;omething in re&s;erve&mdash;&s;omething to hope
for, and look forward to. This I conclude to be the ca&s;e,
from comparing the alacrity and &s;pirits of men, who are
engaged in any pur&s;uit which intere&s;ts them, with the de|jection
and <HI>ennui</HI> of almo&s;t all, who are either born to
&s;o much that they want nothing more, or who have
<HI>u&s;ed up</HI> their &s;atisfactions too &s;oon, and drained the &s;ources
of them.</P>
<P>It is this intolerable vacuity of mind, which carries the
rich and great to the hor&s;e-cour&s;e and the gaming table;
and often engages them in conte&s;ts and pur&s;uits, of which
the &s;ucce&s;s bears no proportion to the &s;olicitude and ex|pence,
with which it is &s;ought. An election for a di&s;|puted
borough &s;hall co&s;t the parties twenty or thirty thou|&s;and
pounds a piece, to &s;ay nothing of the anxiety, humi|liation
and fatigue of the canva&s;s; when a &s;eat in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, of exactly the &s;ame value, may be had
for a tenth part of the money, and with no trouble.
I do not mention this to blame the rich and great, (per|haps
they cannot do better) but in confirmation of what I
have advanced.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="67">
Hope, which thus appears to be of &s;o much importance
to our happine&s;s, is of two kinds&mdash;where there is &s;ome|thing
to be done towards attaining the object of our
hope&mdash;and where there is nothing to be done. The fir&s;t
alone is of any value; the latter being apt to corrupt into
impatience, having nothing in it's power but to &s;it &s;till
and wait, which &s;oon grows tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>The doctrine delivered under this head may be readily
admitted; but how to provide our&s;elves with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of plea&s;urable engagements, is the difficulty. This requires
two things&mdash;judgement in the choice of ends adapted to our
opportunities&mdash;and a command of imagination, &s;o as to be
able, when the judgment has made choice of an end, to
tran&s;fer a plea&s;ure to the <HI>means;</HI> after which the end may
be forgotten as &s;oon as we well.</P>
<P>Hence tho&s;e plea&s;ures are mo&s;t valuable, not which are
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite in the fruition, but mo&s;t productive of en|gagement
and activity in the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The more &s;ignificant our engagements are, and the
better; &s;uch as planning laws, in&s;titutions, manufactures,
charities, improvements, public works, and endeavour|ing,
by our intere&s;t, addre&s;s, &s;olicitations, and activity,
to carry them into effect: or, upon a &s;maller &s;cale, pro|curing
a maintenance and fortune for our families, by a
cour&s;e of indu&s;try and application to our callings, which
forms, and gives motion to the common occupations of
<PB N="30" REF="68">
life&mdash;training up a child&mdash;pro&s;ecuting a &s;cheme for his fu|ture
e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;making our&s;elves ma&s;ters of a lan|guage
or a &s;cience&mdash;improving or managing and e&s;tate&mdash;la|bouring
after a piece of preferment: and la&s;tly, any en|gagement,
which is innocent, is better than none; as
writing a book&mdash;building a hou&s;e&mdash;laying out a garden&mdash;digging
a fi&s;h-pond&mdash;-even rai&s;ing a cucumber or a tulip.</P>
<P>A man, who believes the Chri&s;tian religion, and is in
earne&s;t in his endeavours after the happine&s;s of a future
&s;tate, has, in this re&s;pect, an advantage, over all the
world. For he has con&s;tantly before his eyes an object of
&s;upreme importance, productive of perpetual engagement
and activity, and of which the pur&s;uit (which can be
&s;aid of no pur&s;uit be&s;ides) la&s;ts him to his life's end. Yet
even he, mu&s;t have many ends, be&s;ides the <HI>far end:</HI> but then
they will conduct to that, be &s;ubordinate, and in &s;ome
way or other capable of being referred to that, and derive
their &s;atisfaction, or an addition of &s;atisfaction, from
that.</P>
<P>III. Happine&s;s depends upon the prudent constitution of
the habits.</P>
<P>The art in which the &s;ecret of human happine&s;s in a
great mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts, is to <HI>&s;et</HI> the habits; in &s;uch a man|ner,
that every change may be a change for the better.
The habits them&s;elves are much the &s;ame; for whatever
is made habitual, becomes &s;mooth, and ea&s;y, and indiffe|rent.
<PB N="31" REF="69">
The return to an old habit is likewi&s;e ea&s;y, what|ever
the habit be.&mdash;Therefore, the advantage is with tho&s;e
habits which allow of indulgence in the deviation from
them.&mdash;The luxurious receive no greater plea&s;ure from
their dainties, than the pea&s;ant does from his bread and
chee&s;e: but the pea&s;ant, whenever he goes abroad, finds
a fea&s;t; whereas the epicure mu&s;t be well entertained to
e&s;cape di&s;gu&s;t. Tho&s;e who &s;pend every day at cards, and
tho&s;e who go to plow every day, pa&s;s their time much
alike; intent upon what they are about, wanting nothing,
regretting nothing, they are both in a &s;tate of ea&s;e: but
then, whatever &s;u&s;pends the occupation of the card-player,
di&s;tre&s;&s;es him; whereas to the labourer, every interrup|tion
is a refre&s;hment; and this appears in the different effect
that Sunday produces upon the two, which proves a day
of recreation to the one, but a lamentable burthen to the
other. The man who has learned to live alone, feels
his &s;pirits enlivened whenever he enters into company,
and takes his leave without regret: another, who has
long been accu&s;tomed to a croud, or continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of company, experiences in company no elevation of &s;pi|rits,
nor any greater &s;atisfaction, than what the man of a
retired life finds in his &s;olitary chimney corner. So far
their conditions are equal: but let a change of place,
fortune, or &s;ituation, &s;eparate the companion from his
circle, his vi&s;itors, his club, common-room, or coffee-hou&s;e,
and the difference of advantage in the choice and
constitution of the two habits will &s;hew it&s;elf.&mdash;Solitude
comes to the one clothed with melancholy; to the other
<PB N="32" REF="70">
it brings liberty and quiet.&mdash;You will &s;ee the one fretful
and re&s;tle&s;s, at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of his time, till the
hour come round that he can forget him&s;elf in bed; the
other ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, taking up his book, or his pipe,
as &s;oon as he finds him&s;elf alone; ready to admit any little
amu&s;ement that ca&s;ts up, or turn his hands and attention
to the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s that pre&s;ents it&s;elf; or content with|out
either to &s;it &s;till, and let his trains of thought glide
indolently through his brain, without much u&s;e, perhaps,
or plea&s;ure, but without <HI>hankering</HI> after any thing better,
and without irritation.&mdash;A reader, who has inured him&s;elf
to books of &s;cience and argumentation, if a novel, a well
written pamphlet, an article of news, a narrative of a curious
voyage or travels, fall in his way, &s;its down to the repa&s;t with
reli&s;h; enjoys his entertainment while it la&s;ts, and can
return, when it is over, to his graver reading, without
di&s;ta&s;te. Another, who lives upon &s;weet-meats, with
whom nothing will go down but works of humour and plea|&s;antry,
or who&s;e curio&s;ity mu&s;t be intere&s;ted by perpe|tual
novelty, will con&s;ume a book&s;eller's window in half
a forenoon; during which time, he is rather in &s;earch of
diver&s;ion than diverted, and as books to his ta&s;te are few,
and &s;hort, and rapidly read over, the &s;tock is &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted,
when he is left without re&s;ource from this prin|cipal
&s;upply of innocent amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>So far as circum&s;tances of fortune conduce to happine&s;s,
it is not the income which any man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, but the in|crea&s;e
of income that affords the plea&s;ure. Two per&s;ons,
<PB N="33" REF="71">
of whom one begins with an hundred, and advances his
income to a thou&s;and, a year; and the other &s;ets off with
a thou&s;and, and dwindles down to an hundred, may,
in the cour&s;e of their time, have the receipt and &s;pending
of the &s;ame &s;um of money. Yet their &s;ati&s;faction, &s;o far
as fortune is concerned in it, will be very different. The
&s;eries and &s;um total of their incomes may be the &s;ame,
but it makes a wide difference which end they begin at.</P>
<P>IV. Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in Health.</P>
<P>By health I under&s;tand, as well freedom from bodily
di&s;tempers, as that tranquility, firmne&s;s, and alacrity of
mind, which we call good &s;pirits; and which may pro|perly
enough be included in our notion of health, as they
commonly depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;es, and yield to
the &s;ame management as our bodily con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Health, in this &s;en&s;e, is the one thing needful. There|fore
no pains, expence, &s;elf-denial, or re&s;traint, which we
&s;ubmit to for the &s;ake of it, is too much. Whether it
require us to relinqui&s;h lucrative &s;ituations&mdash;ab&s;tain from
favourite indulgences&mdash;controul intemperate pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;or
undergo tedious regimens&mdash;whatever difficulties it lays
us under, a man, who pur&s;ues his happine&s;s, rationally and
re&s;olutely, will be content to &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>When we we are in perfect health and &s;pirits, we feel
in our&s;elves a happine&s;s independent of any particular
<PB N="34" REF="72">
outward gratification, whatever, and of which we can give
no account. This is an enjoyment which the Deity has
annexed to life; and probably con&s;titutes, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the happine&s;s of infants and brutes, e&s;pecially of
the lower and &s;edentary orders of animals, as oy&s;ters, pe|riwinkles,
and the like; for which I have &s;ometimes been
at a lo&s;s to find out amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The above account of human happine&s;s will ju&s;tify the
two following conclu&s;ions, which, though found in mo&s;t
books of morality, have &s;eldom been &s;upported by any
&s;ufficient rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>FIRST, that happine&s;s is pretty equally di&s;tributed
among&s;t the different orders of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, that vice has no advantage over virtue
even with re&s;pect to this world's happine&s;s.</P>

<P>The four cardinal virtues are <HI>prudence, fortitude, tempe|rance,</HI>
and <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>But the divi&s;ion of Virtue, to which we are now-a-days
mo&s;t accu&s;tomed, is into duties,</P>
<P>Towards <HI>God;</HI> as piety, reverence, re&s;ignation, grati|tude,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>other men;</HI> (or relative duties) as ju&s;tice,
charity, fidelity, loyalty, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>our&s;elves;</HI> as cha&s;tity, &s;obriety, temperance,
pre&s;ervation of life, care of health, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are more of the&s;e di&s;tinctions, which it is not
worth while to &s;et down.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed to &s;tate a few ob&s;ervations, which relate
to the general regulation of our conduct; unconnected
indeed with each other, but very worthy of attention;
<PB N="37" REF="75">
and which fall as properly under the title of this chap|ter,
as of any other.</P>
<P>I. Mankind act more from habit than reflection.</P>
<P>It is on few only and great occa&s;ions, that men delibe|rate
at all; on fewer &s;till, that they in&s;titute any thing
like a regular enquiry into the moral rectitude or depravity
of what they are about to do; or wait for the re&s;ult of it.&mdash;We
are for the mo&s;t part determined, at once, and by an
impul&s;e, which is the effect and energy of pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed
habits. And this con&s;titution &s;eems well adapted to the
exigencies of human life, and the imbecillity of our moral
principle. In the current occa&s;ions, and rapid opportuni|ties
of life, there is oftimes little lei&s;ure for reflection;
and were there more, a man, who has to rea&s;on about his
duty, when the temptation to tran&s;gre&s;s it is upon him, is
almo&s;t &s;ure to rea&s;on him&s;elf into an error.</P>
<P>If we are in &s;o great a degree pa&s;&s;ive under our habits,
where it is a&s;ked, is the exerci&s;e of Virtue, the guilt of
vice, or any u&s;e of moral and religious knowledge? I an|&s;wer,
in the <HI>forming and contracting</HI> of the&s;e habits.</P>
<P>And from hence re&s;ults a rule of life of con&s;iderable im|portance,
viz. that many things are to be done, and ab|&s;tained
from, &s;olely for the &s;ake of habit. We will ex|plain
our&s;elves by an example or two. A beggar with
the appearance of extreme di&s;tre&s;s, a&s;ks our charity. If
<PB N="38" REF="76">
we come to argue the matter, whether the di&s;tre&s;s be real&mdash;whether
it be not brought upon him&s;elf&mdash;whether it be
of public advantage to admit &s;uch applications&mdash;whether
it be not to encourage idlene&s;s and vagrancy&mdash;whether it
may not invite impo&s;tors to our doors, though this
be none&mdash;whether the money can be well &s;pared, or
might not be better applied&mdash;when the&s;e con&s;iderations
are put together, it may appear very doubtful, whether
we ought or ought not to give any thing. But when
we reflect, that the mi&s;ery before our eyes excites our pity,
whether we will or not&mdash;that it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence
to us to cultivate this tenderne&s;s of mind&mdash;that it
is a quality, cheri&s;hed by indulgence, and &s;oon &s;tifled by
oppo&s;ition&mdash;when this I &s;ay is con&s;idered, a wi&s;e man will
do that for his own &s;ake, which he would have he&s;itated to
do for the petitioner's&mdash;he will give way to his compa&s;|&s;ion,
rather than offer violence to a habit of &s;o much ge|neral
u&s;e.</P>
<P>A man of confirmed good habits will act in the &s;ame
manner without con&s;idering at all.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve for one in&s;tance. Another is the follow|ing:
A man has been brought up from his infancy with a
dread of lying. An occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf, where at the ex|pence
of a little veracity, he may divert his company, &s;et off
his own wit with advantage, attract the notice and engage the
partiality of tho&s;e about him. This is no &s;mall temptation.
And when he looks at the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, he
<PB N="39" REF="77">
&s;ees no mi&s;chief that can en&s;ue from this liberty&mdash;no
&s;lander of any man's reputation&mdash;no prejudice likely to ari&s;e
to any man's intere&s;t. Were there nothing farther to be
con&s;idered, it would be hard to &s;ay, why a man under &s;uch
circum&s;tances might not indulge his humour. But when
he reflects that his &s;cruples about lying have hitherto pre|&s;erved
him free from this vice&mdash;that occa&s;ions like the
pre&s;ent will return, where the inducement may be equally
&s;trong, but the indulgence much le&s;s innocent&mdash;that his
&s;cruples will wear away by a few tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and leave
him &s;ubject to one of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t pernicious of
all bad habits, a habit of lying whenever it will &s;erve his
turn.&mdash;When all this, I &s;ay, is con&s;idered, a wi&s;e man
will forego the pre&s;ent, or a much greater plea&s;ure, rather
than lay the foundation of a character &s;o vicious and con|temptible.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid may be explained al&s;o the nature
of habitual virtue. By the definition of Virtue, at the begin|ning
of this chapter, it appears, that the good of mankind
is the &s;ubject, the will of God the rule, and everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s
the motive and end of all virtue. Yet a man &s;hall
perform many an act of virtue, without having either the
good of mankind, the will of God, or everla&s;ting happi|ne&s;s,
in his thoughts; ju&s;t as a man may be a very good &s;er|vant,
without being con&s;cious, at every turn, of a regard
to his ma&s;ter's will, or attention to his intere&s;t; (and your
be&s;t old &s;ervants are of this &s;ort) but then he mu&s;t have
&s;erved for a length of time under the actual direction of
<PB N="40" REF="78">
the&s;e motives to bring it to this&mdash;in which &s;ervice his me|rit
and virtue con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>There are <HI>habits,</HI> not only of drinking, &s;wearing, and
lying, and of &s;ome other things, which are commonly
acknowledged to be habits, and called &s;o; but of every
modification of action, &s;peech, and thought. Man is a
bundle of habits. There are habits of indu&s;try, attention,
vigilance, advertency; of a prompt obedience to the
judgment occurring, or yielding to the fir&s;t impul&s;e of
pa&s;&s;ion; of extending our views to the future, or re&s;ting
upon the pre&s;ent; of apprehending, methodizing, rea|&s;oning;
of indolence and dilatorine&s;s; of vanity, &s;elf-conceit,
melancholy, partiality; of fretfulne&s;s, &s;u&s;picion,
captiou&s;ne&s;s, cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s; of pride, ambition, covet|ou&s;ne&s;s;
of over-reaching, intriguing, projecting. In a
word, there is not a quality or function, either of body
or mind, which does not feel the influence of this great
law of animated nature.</P>
<P>II. The Chri&s;tian religion has not a&s;certained the pre|ci&s;e
quantity of virtue nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>This has been made an objection to Chri&s;tianity; but
without rea&s;on. For, as all revelation, however imparted
originally, mu&s;t be tran&s;mitted by the ordinary vehicle of
language, it behoves tho&s;e, who make the objection, to
&s;hew, that any form of words could be devi&s;ed, which
might expre&s;s this quantity; or that it is po&s;&s;ible to con|&s;titute
<PB N="41" REF="79">
a &s;tandard of moral attainments, accommodated to
the almo&s;t infinite diver&s;ity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the capacities
and opportunities of different men.</P>
<P>It &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to our conceptions of ju&s;tice,
and con&s;onant enough to the language of &s;cripture,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">&startq;He which &s;oweth &s;paringly &s;hall reap al&s;o &s;paringly; and he which &s;oweth bountifully &s;hall reap al&s;o bountifully,&endq; 2 Cor. ix. 6.&mdash;&startq;And that &s;ervant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes; but he that knew not &s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes.&endq; Luke xii. 47, 48.&mdash;&startq;Who|&s;oever &s;hall give you a cup of water to drink, in my name, becau&s;e ye belong to Chri&s;t, verily I &s;ay unto you he &s;hall not lo&s;e his reward,&endq; to wit, intimating that there is in re&s;erve a proportionable reward, for even the &s;malle&s;t act of Virtue. Mark ix. 41.&mdash;See al&s;o the parable of the pounds, Luke xix, 16, &amp;c. where he, who&s;e pound had gained ten pounds, was placed over ten cities; and he, who&s;e pound had gained five pounds, was placed over five cities.</NOTE> to
&s;uppo&s;e, that there are prepared for us rewards and puni&s;h|ments,
of all po&s;&s;ible degrees, from the mo&s;t exalted hap|pine&s;s
down to extreme mi&s;ery; &s;o that &startq;our labour is
never in vain;&endq; whatever advancement we make in virtue,
we procure a proportionable acce&s;&s;ion of future happine&s;s;
as, on the other hand, every accumulation of vice, is the
&startq;trea&s;uring up of &s;o much wrath again&s;t the day of wrath.&endq;
It can never be a ju&s;t oeconomy of providence, it is &s;aid,
to admit one part of mankind into heaven, and condemn
the other to hell, when there may be very little to chu&s;e,
between the wor&s;t man who is received into heaven,
and the be&s;t who is excluded. And how know we
<PB N="42" REF="80">
but that there may be as little to chu&s;e in their condi|tions?</P>
<P>Without entering into a detail of &s;cripture morality,
which would anticipate our &s;ubject, the following general
po&s;itions may be advanced, I thank, with &s;afety:</P>
<P>1. That a &s;tate of happine&s;s is not to be expected by
tho&s;e, who are con&s;cious of no moral or religious rule. I
mean tho&s;e who cannot with truth &s;ay, that they have
been prompted to one action, or with held from one gratifi|cation,
by any regard to virtue or religion, either imme|diate
or habitual.</P>
<P>There needs no other proof of this, than the con&s;ide|ration,
that a brute would be as proper an object of re|ward
as &s;uch a man; and that, if this were the ca&s;e, the
penal &s;anctions of religion could have no place&mdash;for whom
would you puni&s;h, if you make &s;uch a one as this hap|py?&mdash;or
rather indeed religion it&s;elf, both natural and re|vealed,
would cea&s;e to have any u&s;e or authority.</P>
<P>2. That a &s;tate of happine&s;s is not to be expected by
tho&s;e, who re&s;erve to them&s;elves the habitual practice of
any one &s;in, or neglect of one known duty.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, no obedience can proceed upon proper motives
which is not univer&s;al, that is, which is not directed to
<PB N="43" REF="81">
every command of God alike, as they all &s;tand upon the
&s;ame authority.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, &s;uch an allowance would in effect amount to a toleration of every vice in the world.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e, the &s;train of &s;cripture language excludes any
&s;uch hope. When our <HI>duties</HI> are recited, they are put <HI>col|lectively,</HI>
that is, as all and every of them required in the
Christian character. &startq;<HI>Add</HI> to your faith Virtue; and to
Virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and
to temperance patience; and to patience godline&s;s; and
to godline&s;s brotherly kind|ne&s;s; and
to brotherly kind|ne&s;s
charity.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> On the other hand, when <HI>vices</HI> are enumerated, they are put <HI>di&s;junctively,</HI> that is, as &s;epa|rately
and &s;everally excluding the &s;inner from heaven. &startq;<HI>Neither</HI> fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor
effeminate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
nor extortioners, &s;hall inherit the kingdom of heaven.&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.</NOTE></P>

&startq;that he which converteth the &s;inner from the error of his way &s;hall hide a multitude of sins,&endq;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">James v. 20.</NOTE> cannot, I think,
for the rea&s;ons abovementioned, be extended to &s;ins deli|berately
and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="82">
3. That a &s;tate of mere unprofitablene&s;s will not go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>This is expre&s;sly laid down by Chri&s;t in the parable of the
talents, which &s;uper&s;edes all farther rea&s;oning about the matter. &startq;Then he which had received one talent, came
and &s;aid, Lord I know thee that thou art an au&s;tere
man, reaping where thou ha&s;t not &s;own, and gathering
where thou ha&s;t not &s;trawed; and I was afraid, and
hid thy talent in the earth; lo, there thou ha&s;t that is
thine. His lord an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, thou
wicked and <HI>&s;lothful</HI> &s;ervant, thou knewe&s;t, (or knewe&s;t
thou?) that I reap where I &s;owed not, and gather where
I have not &s;trawed; thou oughte&s;t therefore to have put
my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I
&s;hould have received mine own with u&s;ury. Take there|fore
the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents; for unto every one that hath &s;hall be
given, and he &s;hall have abundance; but from him that
hath not, &s;hall be taken away even that which he hath;
<HI>and ca&s;t ye the unprofitable &s;ervant into outer darkne&s;s, there
&s;hall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</HI>&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>III. In every que&s;tion of conduct where one &s;ide is doubt|ful,
and the other &s;ide &s;afe, we are bound to take the &s;afe &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="83">
This is be&s;t explained by an in&s;tance, and I know of
none more to our purpo&s;e, than that of &s;uicide. Suppo&s;e,
for example's &s;ake, that it appear doubtful to a rea&s;oner
upon the &s;ubject, whether he may lawfully de&s;troy him|&s;elf.
He can have no doubt, but that it is lawful for him
to let it alone. Here therefore is a ca&s;e, in which one &s;ide is doubtful, and the other &s;ide &s;afe. By Virtue therefore
of our rule, he is bound to pur&s;ue the &s;afe &s;ide, that is, to forbear from offering violence to himself, whil&s;t a
doubt remains upon his mind about the lawfulne&s;s of
it.</P>
<P>It is <HI>prudent,</HI> you allow, to take the &s;afe &s;ide. But our
ob&s;ervation means &s;omething more than that. We a&s;&s;ert
that the action, concerning which we doubt, whatever
it may be in itself, or to another, would, in <HI>us,</HI> whil&s;t
this doubt remains upon our minds, be &s;inful. The ca&s;e
is expre&s;sly &s;o adjudged by St. Paul, with who&s;e authority we will for the pre&s;ent re&s;t contented. &startq;I know and am
per&s;uaded by the Lord Je&s;us, that there is nothing un|clean
of it&s;elf, but <HI>to him that e&s;teemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean.</HI>&mdash;Happy is
he that condemneth not him&s;elf in that thing which he
alloweth; and he that doubteth is damned (<HI>condemned</HI>)
if he eat, for what&s;oever is not of faith (i. e. not done
with a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the lawfulne&s;s of it) is &s;in.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Romans XIV. 14. 22, 23.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Question, Why am I obliged to keep my Word? con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>WHY am I <HI>obliged</HI> to keep my word?</P>
<P>Because it is right, &s;ays one.&mdash;Becau&s;e it is agreeable to the fitne&s;s of things, &s;ays another.&mdash;Becau&s;e it is con|formable
to rea&s;on and nature, &s;ays a third.&mdash;Becau&s;e it is conformable to truth, &s;ays a fourth.&mdash;Becau&s;e it promotes the public good, &s;ays a fifth.&mdash;Becau&s;e it is required by the

<P>Upon which different accounts, two things are ob&s;erv|able:</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="85">
FIRST, that they all ultimately coincide.</P>
<P>The fitne&s;s of things, means their fitne&s;s to produce happine&s;s; the nature of things means that actual con&s;ti|tution
of the world, by which &s;ome things, as &s;uch and
&s;uch actions, for example, produce happine&s;s, and others
mi&s;ery; rea&s;on is the principle by which we di&s;cover
or judge of this con&s;titution; truth is this judgment
expre&s;&s;ed or drawn out into propo&s;itions. So that it ne|ce&s;&s;arily
comes to pa&s;s, that what promotes the public
happine&s;s, or happine&s;s upon the whole, is agreeable to
the fitne&s;s of things, to nature, to rea&s;on, and to truth;
and &s;uch (as will appear by and by) is the divine character,
that what promotes the general happine&s;s is required by the
will of God; and what has all the above properties mu&s;t
needs be <HI>right,</HI> for right means no more than conformity
to the rule we go by, whatever that rule be.</P>
<P>And this is the rea&s;on, that morali&s;ts, from whatever
different principles they &s;et out, commonly meet in their
conclu&s;ions; that is, they enjoin the &s;ame conduct, pre|&s;cribe
the &s;ame rules of duty, and with a few exceptions,
deliver upon dubious ca&s;es the &s;ame determinations.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it is to be ob&s;erved that the&s;e an&s;wers all leave the the matter &s;hort; for the enquirer may turn
round upon his teacher with a &s;econd que&s;tion, in which
he will expect to be &s;atisfied, namely, <HI>why</HI> am I obliged
to do what is right; to act agreeably to the fitne&s;s of things;
<PB N="49" REF="86">
to conform to rea&s;on, nature, or truth; to promote the
public good, or obey the will of God?</P>
<P>The proper method of conducting the enquiry, is to
&s;ee, FIRST, what we mean, when we &s;ay a man is <HI>obliged</HI> to do a thing, and THEN to &s;hew <HI>why</HI> he is obliged to
do it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What we meant when we &s;ay, a Man is obliged to do a Thing.</HEAD>
<P>A Man is &s;aid to be <HI>obliged,</HI> &startq;when be is urged by a <HI>violent motive re&s;ulting from the command of another.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>I. &startq;The motive mu&s;t be violent.&endq; If a per&s;on, who has
done me &s;ome little &s;ervice, or has a &s;mall place in his di&s;|posal,
a&s;k me for my vote upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, I may po&s;&s;ibly give it him, from a motive of gratitude or expectation;
but I &s;hould hardly &s;ay, that I was <HI>obliged</HI> to give it him,
becau&s;e the inducement does not ri&s;e high enough. Whereas,
if a father or a ma&s;ter, any great benefactor, or one on whom my fortune depends, require my vote, I give it him of
cour&s;e; and my an&s;wer to all who a&s;k me why I voted &s;o
<PB N="50" REF="87">
and &s;o, is, that my father or my ma&s;ter <HI>obliged</HI> me; that
I had received &s;o many favours from, or had &s;o great a dependence upon &s;uch a one, that I was <HI>obliged</HI> to vote as
he directed me.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, &startq;It mu&s;t re&s;ult from the command of another.&endq; Offer a man a gratuity for doing any thing,
for &s;eizing, for example, an offender, he is not <HI>obliged</HI> by
your offer, to do it; nor would he &s;ay he is; though he
may be <HI>induced, per&s;uaded, prevailed upon, tempted</HI>&mdash;If a
magi&s;trate, or the man's immediate &s;uperior command it,
he con&s;iders him&s;elf as <HI>obliged</HI> to comply, though po&s;&s;ibly
he would lo&s;e le&s;s by a refu&s;al in this ca&s;e, than in the former.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to &s;ay, that the words <HI>obligation</HI>
and <HI>obliged</HI> are used uniformly in this &s;en&s;e, or always
with this di&s;tinction; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to tie down popu|lar
phra&s;es to any con&s;tant &s;ignification; but, wherever
the motive is violent enough, and coupled with the idea
of command, authority, law, or the will of a &s;uperior,
there, I take it, we always reckon our&s;elves to be <HI>obliged.</HI></P>
<P>And from this account of obligation it follows, that we
can be obliged to nothing, but what we our&s;elves are to
gain or lo&s;e &s;omething by; for nothing el&s;e can be a vio|lent
motive to us. As we &s;hould not be obliged to obey
the laws, or the magi&s;trate, unless rewards or puni&s;hments,
<PB N="51" REF="88">
plea&s;ure or pain, &s;ome how or other depended upon our obedience; neither could we, without the &s;ame rea&s;on,
be obliged to practi&s;e virtue, obey the commands of God,
do what is right, or to any thing el&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The question, Why I am obliged to keep my Word? re&s;umed.</HEAD>
<P>LET it be remembered, that to be <HI>obliged,</HI> &startq;is to be
urged by a violent motive, re&s;ulting from the com|mand
of another.&endq;</P>
<P>And then let it be a&s;ked, Why am I obliged to keep my

<P>When I fir&s;t turned my thoughts to moral &s;peculations,
an air of my&s;tery &s;eemed to hang over the whole &s;ubject; which aro&s;e, I believe, from this&mdash;that I &s;uppo&s;ed, that to be <HI>obliged</HI> to do any thing, was very different from being <HI>induced</HI> only to do it; and that the obligation to practi&s;e virtue, to do what is right, ju&s;t, &amp;c. was quite another thing, and of another kind, than the obligation,
which a &s;oldier is under to obey his officer, a &s;ervant his ma&s;ter, or any of the civil and ordinary obligations of
human life. Whereas, from what has been &s;aid, it ap|pears,
that moral obligation is like all other obligations;
and that all <HI>obligation</HI> is nothing more than an <HI>inducement</HI>
of &s;ufficient &s;trength, and re&s;ulting, in &s;ome way, from the command of another.</P>
<P>There is always under&s;tood to be a difference between
an act of <HI>prudence</HI> and an act of <HI>duty.</HI> Thus, if I di&s;tru&s;ted
a man, who owed me money, I &s;hould reckon it an act
of prudence to get another bound with him; but I &s;hould
hardly call it an act of duty. On the other hand, it would
be thought a very unu&s;ual and loose kind of language, to
&s;ay, that, as I had made &s;uch a promi&s;e, it was <HI>prudent</HI>
to perform it; or that as my friend, when he went abroad,
placed a box of jewels in my hands, it would be <HI>prudent</HI>
in me to pre&s;erve it for him till he returned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="90">
Now, in what, you will a&s;k, does the difference con&s;i&s;t? Ina&s;much as according to our account of the matter, both
in the one ca&s;e and the other, in acts of duty as well as
acts of prudence, we con&s;ider &s;olely what we &s;hall get or lo&s;e by the act?</P>
<P>The difference, and the only difference, is this; that,
in the one ca&s;e, we con&s;ider what we &s;hall get or lo&s;e in this world; in the other ca&s;e, we con&s;ider al&s;o what we &s;hall get or lo&s;e in the world to come.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would e&s;tablish a &s;y&s;tem of morality, inde|pendent
of a future &s;tate, mu&s;t look out for &s;ome different
idea of moral obligation; unless they can &s;hew that virtue conducts the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to certain happine&s;s in this world,
or to a much greater &s;hare of it, than he could attain by
a different behaviour.</P>
<P>To us there are two great que&s;tions:</P>
<P>I. Will there be after this life, any di&s;tribution, of re|wards
and puni&s;hments at all?</P>
<P>II. If there be, what actions will be rewarded and what
will be puni&s;hed?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion compri&s;es the credibility of the Chri&s;|tian
religion, together with the pre&s;umptive proofs of a
future retribution, from the light of nature. The &s;econd

que&s;tion is the province of morality. Both que&s;tions are
too much for one work. The affirmative therefore of the

upon which the whole fabric re&s;ts, mu&s;t in this treati&s;e be taken
for granted.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Will of God.</HEAD>
<P>AS the will of God is our rule, to enquire what is our
duty, or what we are obliged to do, in any in&s;tance,
is, in effect, to enquire, what is the will of God in that in&s;tance? which con&s;equently becomes the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of morality.</P>
<P>Now there are two methods of coming at the will
of God, on any point:</P>
<P>I. By his expre&s;s declarations, when they are to be had;
and which mu&s;t be &s;ought for in Scripture.</P>
<P>II. By what we can di&s;cover of his de&s;igns and di&s;po&s;ition
from his works, or, as we u&s;ually call it, the light of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="92">
And here we may ob&s;erve the ab&s;urdity of &s;eparating natural and revealed religion from each other. The ob|ject
of both is the &s;ame&mdash;to di&s;cover the will of God&mdash;and
provided we do but di&s;cover it, it matters nothing by
what means.</P>
<P>An amba&s;&s;ador, judging only from what he knows of
his &s;overeign's di&s;po&s;ition, and arguing from what he has
ob&s;erved of his conduct, or is acquainted with of his
de&s;igns, may take his mea&s;ures in many ca&s;es with &s;afety;
and pre&s;ume, with great probability, how his ma&s;ter would
have him act on mo&s;t occa&s;ions that ari&s;e: but if he have
his commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions in his pocket, it would be
&s;trange never to look into them. He will naturally con|duct
him&s;elf by both rules: when his in&s;tructions are clear
and po&s;itive, there is an end of all farther deliberation (un|le&s;s
indeed he &s;u&s;pect their authenticity): where his in|&s;tructions
are &s;ilent or dubious, he will endeavour to &s;up|ply
or explain them, by what he has been able to collect
from other quarters of his ma&s;ter's general inclination or intentions.</P>
<P>Mr. HUME, in his fourth Appendix to his Principles
of Morals, has been plea&s;ed to complain of the modern
&s;cheme of uniting Ethics with the Chri&s;tian Theology. Tho&s;e, who find them&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to join in this com|plaint,
will do well to ob&s;erve what Mr. HUME him&s;elf
has been able to make of morality without this union.
<PB N="56" REF="93">
And for that purpo&s;e, let them read the &s;econd part of the ninth &s;ection of the above e&s;&s;ay; which part contains the practical application of the whole treati&s;e&mdash;a treati&s;e, which
Mr. HUME declares to be "incomparably the be&s;t he &startq;ever wrote.&endq; When they have read it over, let them con&s;ider, whether any motives there propo&s;ed are likely to
be found &s;ufficient, to withhold men from the gratification
of lu&s;t, revenge, envy, ambition, avarice, or prevent the exi&s;tence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Unle&s;s they ri&s;e up from this
celebrated e&s;&s;ay, with very different impre&s;&s;ions upon their
minds, than it ever le&s;t upon mine, they will acknowledge
the nece&s;&s;ity of additional &s;anctions. But the nece&s;&s;ity of
the&s;e &s;anctions is not now the que&s;tion. If they be <HI>in fact establi&s;hed,</HI> if the rewards and puni&s;hments held forth
in the go&s;pel will actually come to pa&s;s, they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be con|&s;idered.
Tho&s;e, who reject the Chri&s;tian religion, are to
make the be&s;t &s;hift they can, to build up a &s;y&s;tem, and lay the foundations of morality, without it. But it ap|pears
to me a great incon&s;i&s;tency, in tho&s;e, who receive Chri&s;tianity, and expect &s;omething to come of it, to endea|vour
to keep all &s;uch expectations out of sight, in their rea&s;onings concerning human duty.</P>
<P>The method of coming at the will of God, concerning
any action, by the light of nature, is to enquire into the ten|dency
of the action to promote or dimini&s;h the general
happine&s;s. And this rule proceeds upon the pre&s;umption,
that God Almighty wills and wi&s;hes the happine&s;s of his
<PB N="57" REF="94">
creatures; and con&s;equently, that tho&s;e actions, which promote that will and wi&s;h, mu&s;t be agreeable to him;
and the contrary.</P>
<P>But, as this pre&s;umption is the foundation of the whole &s;y&s;tem, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to explain the rea&s;ons upon
which it re&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Divine Benevolence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN God created the human &s;pecies, he either
wi&s;hed their happine&s;s, or he wi&s;hed their mi&s;ery,
or he was indifferent and unconcerned about both.</P>
<P>If he had wi&s;hed our mi&s;ery, he might have made &s;ure of his purpo&s;e, by forming our &s;en&s;es to be as many &s;ores and
pains to us, as they are now in&s;truments of gratification
and enjoyment; or by placing us amid&s;t objects, &s;o ill &s;uited
to our perceptions, as to have continually offended us, in|stead
of mini&s;tring to our refre&s;hment and delight. He
might have made, for example, every thing we ta&s;ted bi|tter;
every thing we &s;aw, loath&s;ome; ever thing we touched,
a &s;ting; every &s;mell, a &s;tench; and every &s;ound, a di&s;|cord.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="95">
If he had been indifferent about our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, we mu&s;t impute to our good fortune (as all de&s;ign by this &s;uppo&s;ition is excluded) both the capacity of our &s;en&s;es to
receive plea&s;ure, and the &s;upply of external objects fitted to excite it.</P>
<P>But either of the&s;e, and &s;till more both of them, being too much to be attributed to accident, nothing remains
but the first &s;uppo&s;ition, that God, when he created the human &s;pecies, wi&s;hed their happine&s;s; and made for them the provi&s;ion he has made, with that view, and for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame argument may be propo&s;ed in different terms, thus: Contrivance proves de&s;ign; and the predominant
tendency of the contrivances indicates the di&s;po&s;ition of
the de&s;igner. The world abounds with contrivances; and
all the contrivances, that we are acquainted with, are di|rected
to beneficial purpo&s;es. Evil no doubt exi&s;ts; but it
is never, that we can perceive, the object of contrivance.
Teeth are contrived to eat, not to ache; their aching now
and then is incidental to the contrivance, perhaps in&s;epa|rable
from it; or even, if you will, let it be called a defect
in the contrivance; but it is not the object of it. In de|&s;cribing
implements of hu&s;bandry, you would hardly &s;ay
of a &s;ickle, this is to cut the reapers fingers, though from the con&s;truction of the in&s;trument, and the manner of
u&s;ing it, this mi&s;chief often happens. But if you had occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe in&s;truments of torture or execution,
<PB N="59" REF="96">
this, you would &s;ay, is to extend the &s;inews; this to di&s;|locate
the joints; this to break the bones; this to &s;corch
the &s;oles of the feet. Here pain and mi&s;ery are the objects of the contrivance. Now nothing of this &s;ort is to be
found in the works of nature: we never di&s;cover a train of contrivance to bring about an evil purpo&s;e. No anatomi&s;t
ever di&s;covered a &s;y&s;tem of organization, calculated to
produce pain and di&s;ea&s;e; or, in explaining the parts of the
human body, ever &s;aid, this is to irritate; this to inflame;
this duct is to convey the gravel to the kidneys; this gland
to &s;ecrete the humour which forms the gout: if by chance
he come at a part of which he knows not the u&s;e, the
mo&s;t he can &s;ay is, that it is u&s;ele&s;s; no one ever &s;u&s;pects
that it is put there to incommode, to annoy, or torment.
Since then God hath called forth his con&s;ummate wi&s;dom,
to contrive and provide for our happine&s;s, and the world
appears to have been con&s;tituted with this de&s;ign at fir&s;t,
&s;o long as this con&s;titution is upheld by him, we mu&s;t in
rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame de&s;ign to continue.</P>
<P>The contemplation of univer&s;al nature, rather bewil|ders
the mind than affects it. There is always a bright
&s;pot in the pro&s;pect, upon which the eye re&s;ts, a &s;ingle
example perhaps, by which each man finds him&s;elf more
<HI>convinced</HI> than by all others put together. I &s;eem, for my
own part, to &s;ee the benevolence of the Deity more clearly
in the plea&s;ures of very young children, than in any thing
in the world. The plea&s;ures of grown per&s;ons may be
reckoned partly of their own procuring; e&s;pecially if there
<PB N="60" REF="97">
has been any indu&s;try, or contrivance, or pur&s;uit, to come
at them; or if they are founded, like mu&s;ic, painting, &amp;c.
upon any qualification of their own acquiring. But the plea&s;ures of a healthy infant are &s;o manife&s;tly provided for
it by <HI>another;</HI> and the benevolence of the provi&s;ion is &s;o
unque&s;tionable, that every child I &s;ee at it's &s;port, affords
to my mind a kind of &s;en&s;ible evidence of the finger of God, and of the di&s;po&s;ition which directs it.</P>
<P>But the example, which &s;trikes each man mo&s;t &s;trongly, is the true example for him; and hardly two minds hit
upon the &s;ame; which &s;hews the abundance of &s;uch ex|amples
about us.</P>
<P>We conclude therefore, that God wills and wi&s;hes the happine&s;s of his creatures. And this conclu&s;ion being
once e&s;tabli&s;hed, we are at liberty to go on with the rule built upon it, namely, &startq;that the method of coming at
the will of God, concerning any action, by the light of
nature, is, to enquire into the tendency of that action
to promote or dimini&s;h the general happine&s;s.&endq;</P>

to promote happine&s;s.&mdash;Whatever is expedient, is

<P>But to all this there &s;eems a plain objection, viz. that many actions are u&s;eful, which no one in his wits will

hand of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in would be very u&s;eful. The pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;ome great e&s;tate employs his influence and
fortune, to annoy, corrupt, or oppre&s;s all about him.
His e&s;tate would devolve by his death, to a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of an
oppo&s;ite character. It is useful, therefore, to di&s;patch
<PB N="62" REF="99">
&s;uch a one, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, out of the way, as the neighbourhood would exchange thereby a pernicious tyrant
for a wi&s;e and generous benefactor. It may be u&s;e|ful
to rob a mi&s;er, and give the money to the poor; as
the money no doubt would produce more happine&s;s, by
being laid out in food and cloathing for half a dozen di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
families, than by continuing locked up in the mi&s;er's

place, a piece of preferment, or of a &s;eat in parliament, by bribery
or fal&s;e &s;wearing; as by means of them we may &s;erve
the public more effectually than in our private &s;tation.
What then &s;hall we &s;ay? Mu&s;t we admit the&s;e actions to
be right, which would be to ju&s;tify a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, plunder,
and perjury, or mu&s;t we give up our principle, that the criterion of right is utility?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer is this; that the&s;e actions after all, are not u&s;eful, and for that rea&s;on, and that alone, are not right.</P>

<P>The particular bad con&s;equence of an action, is the mi&s;chief which that &s;ingle action directly and immediately occa&s;ions.</P>

<P><PB N="63" REF="100">
Thus the particular bad con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
above de&s;cribed, is the fright and pain which the decea&s;ed underwent&mdash;the lo&s;s he &s;uffered of life, which is as valuable
to a bad man, as to a good one, or more so&mdash;the pre|judice
and affliction, of which his death was the occa&s;ion,
to his family, friends, and dependents.</P>
<P>The general bad con&s;equence is the violation of this ne|ce&s;&s;ary
general rule, that no man be put to death for his
crimes, but by public authority.</P>
<P>Although therefore &s;uch an action have no particular

might be mentioned.</P>

The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in knocked the rich villain on the head, becau&s;e
he thought him better out of the way than in it. If you
allow this excu&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, you mu&s;t allow it to all, who act in the &s;ame manner, and from the
&s;ame motive; that is, you mu&s;t allow every man to kill

put an end to human &s;ociety, if not to the human &s;pe|cies.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="102">
The nece&s;&s;ity of general rules in human governments
is apparent: but whether the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the
divine oeconomy, in that di&s;tribution of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments,
to which a morali&s;t looks forward, may be
doubted.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that general rules are nece&s;&s;ary to every mo|ral
government; and by moral government I mean any
di&s;pen&s;ation, who&s;e object is to influence the conduct of rea&s;onable creatures. For if, of two actions perfectly &s;imilar,
one be puni&s;hed, and another rewarded or forgiven,
which would be the con&s;equence of rejecting general rules,
the &s;ubjects of &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation would no longer know,
either what to expect or how to act&mdash;rewards and puni&s;hments
would cea&s;e to be &s;uch would become accidents,
like the &s;troke of a thunderbolt, or the di&s;covery of a mine&mdash;like a blank or a benefit ticket in a lottery, they would occa&s;ion pain or plea&s;ure when they happened; but follow|ing
in no known order, from any particular cour&s;e of
action, they could have no previous influence or effect
upon the conduct.</P>
<P>An attention to general rules, therefore, is included in
the very idea of reward and puni&s;hment. Con&s;equently
whatever rea&s;on there is to expect future reward and pu|ni&s;hment
at the hand of God, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to
believe, that he will proceed in the di&s;tribution of it by general rules.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="103">
As the general con&s;equence of an action, upon which
&s;o much of the guilt of a bad action depends, con&s;i&s;ts in the
example; it &s;hould &s;eem, that, if the action be done with perfect &s;ecrecy, &s;o as to furni&s;h no bad example, that part of the guilt drops off. In the ca&s;e of &s;uicide, for in&s;tance,
if a man can &s;o manage matters, as to take away his own
life, without being known or &s;u&s;pected to have done it,
he is not chargeable with any mi&s;chief from the example;
nor does his puni&s;hment &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ave.
the authority of any general rule.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, tho&s;e who rea&s;on in this manner,

con&s;equences, it makes no difference in what way or
at what di&s;tance they, en&s;ue.</P>
<P>To impre&s;s this doctrine upon the minds of young
readers, and to teach them to extend their views beyond
the immediate mi&s;chief of a crime, I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin
<PB N="69" REF="106">
a &s;tring of in&s;tances, where the particular con&s;equence is comparatively in&s;ignificant; and where the malignity of
the crime, and the &s;everity with which human laws pur&s;ue
it, is almo&s;t entirely on account of the general con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;equence of coining, is the lo&s;s of a guinea, or of half a guinea, to the per&s;on who receives
the counterfeit money; the general con&s;equence (by which
I mean the con&s;equence that, would, en&s;ue, if the &s;ame practice were generally permitted) is to aboli&s;h the u&s;e of money.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;equence of forgery, is a damage of
twenty or thirty pounds, to the man who accepts the forged
bill; the general con&s;equence is, the &s;toppage of paper currency.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;equence of &s;heep-&s;tealing, or hor&s;e|&s;tealing,
is a lo&s;s to the owner, to the amount of the value
of the &s;heep or hor&s;e &s;tolen; the general con&s;equence is,
that the land could not be occupied, nor the market &s;up|plied
with this kind of &s;tock.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;equence of breaking into a hou&s;e
empty of inhabitants; is the lo&s;s of a pair of &s;ilver candle|&s;ticks,
or a few &s;poons; the general con&s;equence is, that
nobody could leave their hou&s;e empty.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="107">
The particular con&s;equence of &s;muggling, may be a de|duction
from the national fund too minute for computa|tion:
the general con&s;equence is the de&s;truction of one en|tire
branch of public revenue a proportionable increa&s;e
of the burthen upon other branches; and the ruin of all
fair and open trade in the article &s;muggled.</P>
<P>The particular con&s;equence of an officer's breaking his
parole, is the lo&s;s of a pri&s;oner, who was po&s;&s;ibly not
worth keeping; the general con&s;equence is, that this mi|tigation
of captivity would be refu&s;ed to all others.</P>
<P>And what proves inconte&s;tibly the &s;uperior importance
of general con&s;equences is, that crimes are the &s;ame, and treated in the &s;ame manner, though the particular con&s;e|quence
be very different. The crime and fate of the
house-breaker is the fame, whether his booty be five pounds
or fifty. And the rea&s;on is, that the general con&s;equence
is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The want of this di&s;tinction between particular and
general con&s;equences, or rather the not &s;ufficiently attend|ing
to the latter, is the cau&s;e of that perplexity we meet
with in the ancient morali&s;ts. On the one hand, they
were &s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity of pronouncing actions
good or evil, without regard to the good or evil they pro|duced.
On the other hand, they were &s;tartled with the con|clu&s;ions
to which a &s;teady adherence to con&s;equences &s;ee|med
&s;ometimes to conduct them. To relieve this difficulty,
<PB N="71" REF="108">
they contrived the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or the <HI>hone&s;tum,</HI> by which
terms they meant to con&s;titute a mea&s;ure of right, di&s;tinct
from utility. Whil&s;t the <HI>utile</HI> &s;erved them, that is, whil&s;t
it corre&s;ponded with their habitual notions of the rectitude
of actions, they went by <HI>it.</HI> When they fell in with &s;uch
ca&s;es as tho&s;e mentioned in the &s;ixth chapter, they took
leave of their guide, and re&s;orted to the <HI>hone&s;tum.</HI> The
only account they could give of the matter was, that the&s;e
actions might be u&s;eful; but becau&s;e they were not at the
&s;ame time <HI>hone&s;ta,</HI> they were by no means to be deemed ju&s;t or right.</P>
<P>From the principles delivered in this and the two pre|ceding
chapters, a maxim may be explained, which is in
every man's mouth, and in most men's without meaning,
viz. &startq;not to do evil, that good may come:&endq; that is, let
us not violate a general, rule, for the &s;ake of any particular good con&s;equence we may expect. Which is for the mo&s;t
part a &s;alutary caution, the advantage &s;eldom compen&s;ating
for the violation of the rule. Strictly &s;peaking, that can|not
be &startq;evil,&endq; from which &startq;good comes;&endq; but in this
way, and with a view to the di&s;tinction between particular
and general con&s;equences, it may.</P>
<P>We will conclude this &s;ubject of <HI>con&s;equences</HI> with the
following reflection. A man may fancy, that any action
of his, with re&s;pect to the public, mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable; &s;o al&s;o is the agent. If his crime produce but a &s;mall
<PB N="72" REF="109">
effect upon the univer&s;al intere&s;t, his puni&s;hment or de|&s;truction
bears a &s;mall proportion to the &s;um of happine&s;s
and mi&s;ery in the creation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Right.</HEAD>
<P>RIGHT and obligation are reciprocal; that is, where|ever
there is a right in one per&s;on, there is a corre&s;|ponding
obligation upon others. If one man has a &startq;right&endq;
to an e&s;tate; others are &startq;obliged&endq; to ab&s;tain from it&mdash;if
parents have a &startq;right&endq; to reverence from their children;
children are &startq;obliged&endq; to reverence their parents; and
&s;o in all other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Now, becau&s;e moral obligation depends, as we have
&s;een, upon the will of God, <HI>right,</HI> which is correlative to
it, mu&s;t depend upon the &s;ame. Right therefore &s;ignifies,
<HI>the being con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>If the divine will determines the di&s;tinction of right and
wrong, what el&s;e is it but an identical propo&s;ition, to &s;ay
of God, that he acts right, or how is it po&s;&s;ible, even to
conceive that he &s;hould act wrong: yet the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are
intelligible and &s;ignificant. The ca&s;e is this: by virtue of
the two principles, that the will of God is the mea&s;ure of
<PB N="73" REF="110">
right and wrong, and that God wills the happine&s;s of his
creatures, we arrive at certain conclu&s;ions; which conclu|&s;ions
become rules, and we &s;oon learn to pronounce ac|tions
right or wrong, according, as they agree or di&s;agree
with our rules, without looking any farther: and when
the habit is once e&s;tabli&s;hed of &s;topping at the rules, we
can go back and compare with the&s;e rules, even the divine
conduct it&s;elf, and yet it may be true (only not ob&s;erved
by us at the time) that the rules them&s;elves are deduced
from the divine will.</P>
<P>Right is a quality of per&s;ons or of actions.</P>
<P>Of per&s;ons; as when we &s;ay, &s;uch a one has a &startq;right&endq;

has not a &startq;right&endq; over his own life.</P>
<P>Of actions; as in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the following: it

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Divi&s;ion of Rights.</HEAD>
<P>RIGHTS, when applied to per&s;ons, that is, when ap|plied
in the way in which we u&s;ed the term &startq;right&endq;
in the former &s;et of expre&s;&s;ions, are</P>
<P>Natural or adventitious.</P>
<P>Alienable or unalienable.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="112">
Perfect or imperfect.</P>
<P>I. Rights are natural or adventitious.</P>
<P>Natural rights are &s;uch as would belong to a man, al|though
there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the world no civil government
whatever.</P>
<P>Adventitious rights are &s;uch as would not.</P>
<P><HI>Natural rights</HI> are, a man's right to his life, limbs, and
liberty; his right to the produce of his per&s;onal labour;
to the u&s;e, in common with others, of air, light, water.
If a thou&s;and different per&s;ons, from a thou&s;and different
corners of the world, were ca&s;t together upon a de&s;ert
i&s;land, they would from the fir&s;t, be every one entitled to
the&s;e rights.</P>
<P><HI>Adventitious rights</HI> are, the right of a King over his &s;ub|jects;
of a General over his &s;oldiers; of a judge over the
life and liberty of a pri&s;oner; a right to elect or appoint
magi&s;trates, to impo&s;e taxes, decide di&s;putes, direct the
de&s;cent or di&s;po&s;ition of property; a right, in a word, in
any one man, or particular body of men, to make laws and
regulations for the re&s;t. For none of the&s;e rights would
exi&s;t in the newly inhabited i&s;land.</P>
<P>And here it will be a&s;ked how adventitious rights are
created; or, which is the &s;ame thing, how any new rights
<PB N="76" REF="113">
can accrue, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil &s;ociety; as rights
of all kinds, we remember, depend upon the will of God,
and civil &s;ociety is only the ordinance and in&s;titution of
man? For the &s;olution of this difficulty, we mu&s;t return to
our fir&s;t principles. God wills the happine&s;s of mankind,
and the exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety, as conducive to that hap|pine&s;s.
Con&s;equently, many things, which are u&s;eful for
the &s;upport of civil &s;ociety in general, or for the conduct
and con&s;ervation of particular &s;ocieties already e&s;tabli&s;hed,
are, for that rea&s;on, &startq;con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God,&endq;
or &startq;right,&endq; which, without that rea&s;on, i. e. without the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil, &s;ociety, would not have been &s;o.</P>
<P>From whence al&s;o it appears, that, adventitious rights,
though immediately derived from human appointment, are
not, for that rea&s;on, le&s;s &s;acred, nor the obligation to re|&s;pect
them le&s;s cogent, than, natural rights. They both
ultimately rely upon the &s;ame authority, the will of God.
Such, a man claims a right to this e&s;tate. He can &s;hew,
it is true, nothing for his right, but a rule of the civil
community to which he belongs; and this rule may be
arbitrary, capricious, and ab&s;urd. Notwith&s;tanding all
this, there would be the &s;ame &s;in in di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the man
of his e&s;tate by craft or violence, as if it had been a&s;&s;igned
him, like the partition of the country among&s;t the twelve
tribes, by the immediate de&s;ignation and appointment
of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="114">
II. Rights are alienable or unalienable.</P>
<P>Which terms explain them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The right we have to mo&s;t of tho&s;e things, which we
call property, as hou&s;es, lands, money, &amp;c. is alienable.</P>
<P>The right of a prince over his people, of a hu&s;band
over his wife, of a ma&s;ter over his &s;ervant, is generally and
naturally unalienable.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction depends upon the mode of acquiring the
right. If the right originate from a contract; and be
limited to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> by the expre&s;s terms of the contract,
or by the common interpretation of &s;uch contracts, (which
is equivalent to an expre&s;s &s;tipulation) or by a <HI>per&s;onal con|dition</HI>
annexed to the right, then it is unalienable. In all
other ca&s;es it is alienable.</P>
<P>The right to civil liberty is alienable; though in the ve|hemence
of our zeal for it, and in the language of &s;ome
political remon&s;trances, it is often pronounced to be an
unalienable right. The true rea&s;on why mankind hold in
dete&s;tation the memory of tho&s;e who have &s;old their li|berty
to a tyrant, is, that together with their own, they
&s;old commonly, or endangered, the liberty of others;
which certainly they had no right to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="115">
III. Rights are perfect or imperfect.</P>
<P>Perfect rights may be a&s;&s;erted by force, or, what in
civil &s;ociety comes into the place of private force, by
course of law.</P>
<P>Imperfect rights may not.</P>
<P>Examples of perfect rights. A man's right to his life,
per&s;on, hou&s;e; for if the&s;e be attacked, he may repel the
attack by in&s;tant violence, or puni&s;h the aggre&s;&s;or by law;
a man's right to his e&s;tate, furniture, cloaths, money, and
to all ordinary articles of property; for if they be inju|riou&s;ly
taken from him, he may compel the author of the
injury to make re&s;titution or &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Examples of imperfect rights. In elections of appoint|ments
to offices, where the qualifications are pre&s;cribed,
the be&s;t qualified candidate has a right to &s;ucce&s;s; yet,
if he be rejected, he has no remedy. He can neither
&s;eize the office by force, nor obtain redre&s;s at law; his right
therefore is imperfect. A poor neighbour has a right to
relief; yet if it be refu&s;ed him, he mu&s;t not extort it.
A benefactor has a right to returns of gratitude from the
per&s;on he has obliged; yet if he meet with none, he
mu&s;t acquie&s;ce. Children have a right to affection and
education from their parents; and parents on their part,
to duty and reverence from their children; yet if the&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="116">
rights be on either &s;ide withheld, there is no compul&s;ion
to enforce them.</P>
<P>It may be at fir&s;t view difficult to apprehend, how a
per&s;on &s;hould have a right to a thing, and yet have no
right to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary to obtain it. This diffi|culty,
like mo&s;t others in morality, is re&s;olvable into the
nece&s;&s;ity of general rules. The reader recollects, that a
per&s;on is &s;aid to have a &startq;right&endq; to a thing, when it is
&startq;con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God&endq; that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s
it. So that the que&s;tion is reduced to this; How it comes
to pa&s;s, that it &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God,
that a per&s;on &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a thing, and yet not be con&s;i&s;tent
with the &s;ame will that he &s;hould u&s;e force to obtain it?
The rea&s;on is, that the permi&s;&s;ion of force in this ca&s;e,
becau&s;e of the indeterminatene&s;s, either of the object, or
of the circum&s;tances of the right, would, in it's con&s;e|quence,
lead to the permi&s;&s;ion of force in other ca&s;es,
where there was no right at all. The candidate above de|&s;cribed
has, no doubt, a right to &s;ucce&s;s; but his right
depends upon his qualifications: for in&s;tance, upon his
comparative virtue, learning, &amp;c.&mdash;there mu&s;t he &s;ome|body
therefore to compare them. The exi&s;tence, degree,
and re&s;pective importance of the&s;e qualifications are all
indeterminate; there mu&s;t be &s;omebody therefore to de|termine
them. To allow the candidate to demand &s;ucce&s;s
by force, is to make him the judge of his own qualifica|tions.
You cannot do this, but you mu&s;t make all other
candidates, the &s;ame; and that manife&s;tly would open a
<PB N="80" REF="117">
door to demands, without number, rea&s;on, or right. In,
like manner, a poor man has a right to relief from, the
rich; but the mode, &s;ea&s;on, and quantum of that relief&mdash;who
&s;hall contribute to it, or how much&mdash;are not a&s;cer|tained.
Yet the&s;e points, mu&s;t be a&s;certained, before a
claim to relief can be pro&s;ecuted by force. For to allow
the poor to a&s;certain them for them&s;elves, would be to
expo&s;e property to &s;o many of the&s;e claims, that it would
lo&s;e it's value, or cea&s;e indeed to be property. The &s;ame
ob&s;ervation holds of all other ca&s;es, of imperfect rights;
not to mention, that in the in&s;tances of gratitude, affection,
reverence, and the like, force is excluded by the very idea
of the duty, which mu&s;t be voluntary, or not at all.</P>
<P>Wherever the right is imperfect, in the corre&s;ponding
obligation mu&s;t be &s;o too. I am obliged to prefer the be&s;t
candidate, to relieve the poor, be grateful to my benefac|tors,
take care of my children, and reverence my parents;
but in all the&s;e ca&s;es, my obligation, like their right, is
imperfect.</P>
<P>I call the&s;e obligations &startq;imperfect,&endq; in conformity to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed language of writers upon the &s;ubject; though
the term is not at all to my mind. It &s;eems very ill
cho&s;en on one account, that it leads many to imagine,
that there is le&s;s guilt in the violation of an imperfect obli|gation,
than of a perfect one. Which is a groundle&s;s
notion. For an obligation being perfect or imperfect, de|termines
only whether, violence may or may not be em|ployed
<PB N="81" REF="118">
to enforce it; and determines nothing el&s;e. The
degree of guilt incurred by the violation of it, is another
matter, and is determined by circum&s;tances altogether
independent of this di&s;tinction. A man, who by a par|tial,
prejudiced, or corrupt vote, di&s;appoints a worthy
candidate of a &s;tation in life, upon which his hopes, po&s;&s;ibly,
and livelyhood depend, and thereby di&s;courages merit and
emulation in others, incurs, and per&s;uaded, a much greater
crime, than if he had filched a book out of a library, or
picked a pocket of a handkerchief; though in the one
ca&s;e, he violates only an imperfect, right, in the other a
perfect one.</P>
<P>As po&s;itive precepts are often indeterminate in their ex|tent,
and the indeterminatene&s;s of an obligation makes it,
as we have &s;een; imperfect it comes to pa&s;s, that po&s;itive
precepts commonly produce an imperfect obligation.</P>
<P>Negative precepts or prohibitions, being generally pre|ci&s;e,
con&s;titute accordingly a perfect obligation.</P>
<P>The fifth commandment is po&s;itive, and the duty which
re&s;ults from it is imperfect.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth-commandment is negative, and impo&s;es a per|fect
obligation.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue find their principal exerci&s;e among&s;t
the imperfect obligations; the laws of civil &s;ociety taking
pretty good care of the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The general Rights of Mankind.</HEAD>
<P>BY the general Rights of Mankind, I mean the rights
which belong to the &s;pecies collectively; the com|mon
&s;tock, as I may &s;ay, which they have &s;ince di&s;tributed
among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>These are,</P>
<P>I. A right to the fruits or vegetable produce of the earth</P>
<P>The in&s;en&s;ible parts of the creation are incapable of in|jury;
and it is nugatory to enquire into the right, where
the u&s;e can be attended with no injury. But it may be
worth ob&s;erving, for the &s;ake of an inference which will
appear below, that, as God has created us with a want and
de&s;ire of food, and provided things &s;uited by their nature
to &s;u&s;tain and &s;atisfy us, we may fairly pre&s;ume, that he
intended we &s;hould apply them to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>II. A right to the fle&s;h of animals.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="120">
This is a very different claim from the former. Some
apology &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for the pain and lo&s;s which we
occa&s;ion to brutes, by re&s;training them of their liberty,
mutilating their bodies, and at la&s;t, putting an end to
their lives, which we &s;uppo&s;e to be their all, for our plea|&s;ure
or conveniency.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons alledged in vindication of this practice, are
the following: that brutes being created to prey upon
each other, affords a kind of analogy to prove, that we
were intended to feed upon them; that, if let alone, they
would over-run the earth, and exclude mankind from the
occupation, of it; that they are requited for what they &s;uf|fer
at our hands, by our care and protection.</P>
<P>Upon which rea&s;ons, I would ob&s;erve, that <HI>the analogy,</HI>
contended for, is extremely lame; brutes having no power
to &s;upport life by any other means, which we have; for
the whole human &s;pecies might &s;ub&s;i&s;t entirely upon fruit,
pul&s;e, herbs and roots, as many tribes of Hindoos actually
do. The two other rea&s;ons may be good rea&s;ons, as far as
they go; for, no doubt, if man had been &s;upported entirely
by vegetable food, a great part of tho&s;e animals, which
die to furni&s;h his table, would never have lived: but they
by no means ju&s;tify our right over the lives of brutes, to
the extent in which we exerci&s;e it. What danger is there,
for in&s;tance, of fi&s;h interfering with us, in the u&s;e of their
element? Or what do <HI>we</HI> contribute to their &s;upport or
pre&s;ervation?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="121">
It &s;eems to me that it would be difficult to defend this
right, by any arguments which the light and order of na|ture
afford; and that we are beholden for it, to the per|mi&s;&s;ion
recorded in &s;cripture, Gen. ix. 1, 2, 3, &startq;And God

and multiply and repleni&s;h the earth; and the fear
of you, and the dread of you, &s;hall be upon every bea&s;t
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon
all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fi&s;hes
of the &s;ea; into your hand are they delivered: every
moving, thing &s;hall be meat for you; even as the green
herb, have I given you all things.&endq; To Adam and his
po&s;terity had been granted at the creation, &startq;every green
herb for meat,&endq; and nothing more. In the la&s;t clau&s;e
of the pa&s;&s;age now produced, the old grant is recited, and
extended to the fre&s;h of animals, &startq;even as the green herb,
have I given you all things.&endq; But this was not till
after the flood; the inhabitants of the antediluvian world
therefore had no &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion, that we know of.
Whether they actually refrained from the fle&s;h of animals,
is another que&s;tion. Abel, we read, was a keeper of &s;heep;
and what he kept them for, but to eat, is hard to &s;ay (un|le&s;s
it were for &s;acrifices): might not, however, &s;ome of
the &s;tricter &s;ects among them be &s;crupulous, as to this
point; and might not Noah and his family be of this de|&s;cription;
for it is not probable that God would publi&s;h a
permi&s;&s;ion, to authori&s;e a practice which had never, been
disputed?</P>

Wanton, and what is wor&s;e, &s;tudied cruelty to brutes,

<P>From rea&s;on then, or revelation, or from both together,
it appears to be God Almighty's intention, that the produc|tions
of the earth &s;hould be applied to the &s;u&s;tentation of
human life. Con&s;equently, all wa&s;te and mi&s;application
of the&s;e productions, is contrary to the divine intention

as <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror did, into a fore&s;t for hun|ting&mdash;or,
what is not much better, &s;uffering them to con|tinue
in that &s;tate&mdash;or letting large tracts of land lie barren,
becau&s;e the owner cannot cultivate them, nor will part
with them, to tho&s;e who can&mdash;or de&s;troying, or &s;uffering
to peri&s;h, great part of an article of human provi&s;ion, in
order to enhance the price of the remainder; which is &s;aid
to have been till lately, the ca&s;e with fi&s;h caught for the
London, market&mdash;or dimini&s;hing the breed of animals, by a
wanton, or improvident con&s;umption of the young; as of
the fry of &s;almon, the &s;pawn of &s;hell fi&s;h; the u&s;e of un|lawful
nets, or at improper &s;ea&s;ons; or, what is the &s;ame
evil in a &s;maller way, the expending of human food, on &s;u|perfluous
dogs or hor&s;es&mdash;reducing the quantity, to alter the
quality, and generally for the wor&s;e; as the di&s;tillation of
<PB N="86" REF="123">
&s;pirits from bread corn, the boiling down of &s;olid meat for
&s;auces, e&s;&s;ences, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the le&s;&s;on which our Saviour, after his
manner, inculcates, when he bids his di&s;ciples &startq;gather up
the fragments, that nothing be lo&s;t.&endq; And it opens in-indeed
a new field of duty. Schemes of wealth or profit,
prompt the active part of mankind to ca&s;t about, how they
may convert their property to the mo&s;t advantage&mdash;and
their own advantage, and that of the public commonly con|cur.
But it has not as yet entered into the minds of man|kind,
that it is a <HI>duty,</HI> to add what we can, to the common
&s;tock of provi&s;ion, by extracting out of our e&s;tates, the mo&s;t
they will yield; or that it is any &s;in to neglect this.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame intention of God Almighty, we al&s;o de|duce
another conclu&s;ion, namely, that nothing ought to be
made exclu&s;ive property, which can be conveniently enjoyed
in common.</P>
<P>The general intention of God Almighty is, that the pro|duce
of the earth be applied to the u&s;e of man. This ap|pears
from the con&s;titution of nature, or, if you will, from
his expre&s;s declaration; and this is all that appears hither|to.
Under this general donation, one man has the &s;ame
right as another. You pluck an apple from a tree, or take
a lamb out of a flock, for your immediate u&s;e and nouri&s;h|ment,
and I do the &s;ame; and we both plead for what we
do, the general intention of the Supreme Proprietor. So
<PB N="87" REF="124">
far all is right; but you cannot claim the whole tree, or
the whole flock, and exclude me from any &s;hare of them,
and plead the general intention. The plea will not &s;erve
you, you mu&s;t &s;hew &s;omething farther. You mu&s;h &s;hew,
by probable arguments at lea&s;t, that it is God's intention,
that the&s;e things &s;hould be parcelled out to individuals; and
that the e&s;tabli&s;hed di&s;tribution, under which you claim,
&s;hould be upheld. Shew me this, and I am &s;atisfied. But
until this be &s;hewn, the general intention, which has been
made appear, and which is all that does appear, mu&s;t pre|vail;
and under that, my title is as good as yours. Now
there is no argument to induce &s;uch a pre&s;umption, but
one, that the thing cannot be enjoyed at all, or enjoyed with
the &s;ame, or with nearly the &s;ame advantage, while it con|tinues
in common, as when appropriated. This is true,
where there is not enough for all, or where the article in
que&s;tion requires care or labour in the production or pre|&s;ervation:
but where no &s;uch rea&s;on obtains, and the thing
is in it's nature capable of being enjoyed by as many as
will, it &s;eems an arbitrary u&s;urpation upon the rights of
mankind, to confine the u&s;e of it to any.</P>
<P>If a medicinal &s;pring were di&s;covered in a field which
was private property, copious enough for every purpo&s;e it
could be applied to, I would award a compen&s;ation to the
owner of the field, and a liberal profit to take author of the
di&s;covery, e&s;pecially, if he had be&s;towed pains or expence
upon the &s;earch. But I que&s;tion, whether any human
laws would be ju&s;tified, or would ju&s;tify the owner, in
<PB N="88" REF="125">
prohibiting mankind from the u&s;e of the water, or &s;etting
&s;uch a price upon it, as would almo&s;t-amount to a prohi|bition.</P>
<P>If there he fi&s;heries, which are inexhau&s;tible; as, for
aught I know, the cod-fi&s;hery upon the Banks of New|foundland,
and the herring fi&s;hery in the Briti&s;h &s;eas are;
then all tho&s;e conventions, by which one or two nations
claim to them&s;elves, and guarantee to each other, the ex|clu&s;ive
enjoyment of the&s;e fi&s;heries, are &s;o many encroach|ments
upon the general rights of mankind.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame principle may be determined a que&s;tion,
which makes a great figure in books of natural law, <HI>utrum
mare &s;it liberum?</HI> that is, as I under&s;tand it, whether the
exclu&s;ive right of navigating particular &s;eas, or a control
over the navigation of the&s;e &s;eas, can be claimed con&s;i&s;tently
with the law of nature, by any nation. What is nece&s;&s;ary
for each nation's &s;afety we allow; as their own bays, creeks,
and harbours, the &s;ea contiguous to, that is, within cannon
&s;hot, or three leagues of their coa&s;t; and upon the &s;ame
principle of &s;afety (if upon any principle) mu&s;t be de|fended,
the claim of the Venetian &s;tate to the Adriatic, of
Denmark to the Baltic, of Great Britain to the &s;eas which
inve&s;t the i&s;land. But, when Spain a&s;&s;erts a right to the
Pacific ocean, or Portugal to the Indian &s;eas, or when any
nation extends it's preten&s;ions much beyond the limits of
it's own territories, they erect a claim, which interferes
<PB N="89" REF="126">
with the benevolent de&s;igns of providence, and which no
human authority can ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>III. Another right, which may be called a general right,
as it is incidental to every man who is in a &s;itnation to claim
it, is the right of extreme nece&s;&s;ity; by which is meant, a
right to u&s;e or de&s;troy another's property, when it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for our own pre&s;ervation, to do &s;o; as a right to take,
without or again&s;t the owner's leave, the fir&s;t food, cloaths,
or &s;helter we meet with, when we are in danger of peri&s;hing
through want of them; a right to throw goods over board,
to &s;ave the &s;hip; or to pull down a hou&s;e, in order to &s;top the
progre&s;s of a fire; and a few other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind.
Of which right the foundation &s;eems to be this, that, when
property was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, the in&s;titution was not in|tended
to operate to the de&s;truction of any: therefore when
&s;uch con&s;equences would follow, all regard to it is &s;upper|&s;eded.
Or rather perhaps the&s;e are the few ca&s;es, where
the particular con&s;equence exceeds the general con&s;equence;
where the mi&s;chief re&s;ulting from the violation of the ge|neral
rule, is over-balanced by the advantage.</P>
<P>Re&s;titution however is due, when in our power; becau&s;e
the laws of property are to be adhered to, &s;o far as con&s;i&s;ts
with &s;afety; and re&s;titution, which is one of tho&s;e laws, &s;up|po&s;es
the danger to be over. But what is to be re&s;tored? Not
the full value of the property de&s;troyed, but what it was
worth at the time of de&s;troying it; which, con&s;idering the
danger it was in of peri&s;hing, might be very little.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Use of the In&s;titution of Property.</HEAD>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be &s;ome very important advantages to
account for an in&s;titution, in one view of it, &s;o pa|radoxical
and unnatural.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e advantages, are the following.</P>
<P>I. It increa&s;es the produce of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="129">
The earth, in climates like ours, produces little without
cultivation; and none would be found willing to cultivate
the ground, if others were to be admitted to an equal
&s;hare of the produce. The &s;ame is true of the care of
flocks and herds of tame animals.</P>
<P>Crabs and acorns, red deer, rabbits, game, and fi&s;h,
are all we &s;hould have to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, if we tru&s;ted to the
&s;pontaneous productions of this country: and it fares not
much better with other countries. A nation of North
American &s;avages, con&s;i&s;ting of two or three hundred, will
occupy, and be half-&s;tarved upon a tract of land, which,
in Europe, and with European management, would be
&s;ufficient for the maintenance of as many thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>In &s;ome fertile &s;oils, with great abundance of fi&s;h upon
their coa&s;ts, and in regions where cloaths are unnece&s;&s;ary,
a con&s;iderable degree of population may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without
property, in land; which is the ca&s;e in the i&s;lands of Ota|heite;
but in others, as in New Zealand, though this &s;ort
of property obtain, in a &s;mall degree, the inhabitants for
want of a more &s;ecure and regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of it, are
driven ofttimes by the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion, to devour each
other.</P>
<P>II. It pre&s;erves the produce of the earth to maturity.</P>
<P>We may judge, what would be the effects of a com|munity
of right to the productions of the earth, from the
<PB N="94" REF="130">
trifling &s;pecimens that we &s;ee of it at pre&s;ent. A cherry-tree
in a hedge-row, nuts in a wood, the gra&s;s of an un&s;tinted
pa&s;ture, are &s;eldom of much advantage, to any body, be|cau&s;e
people do not wait for the proper &s;ea&s;on of reaping
them. Corn, if any were &s;own, would never ripen;
lambs and calves would never grow up to &s;heep and cows,
becau&s;e the fir&s;t per&s;on that met with them would reflect,
that he had better take them as they are, than leave them
for another.</P>
<P>III. It prevents conte&s;ts.</P>
<P>War and wa&s;te, tumult and confu&s;ion, mu&s;t be una|voidable
and eternal, where there is not enough for all,
and where there are no rules to adjust the divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>IV. It improves the conveniency of living.</P>
<P>This it does two ways. It enables mankind to divide
them&s;elves into di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ions; which is impo&s;&s;ible,
unle&s;s a man can exchange the productions of his own
art for what he wants from others; and exchange implies
property. Much of the advantage of civilized over &s;a|vage
life, depends upon this. When a man is from nece&s;|&s;ity
his own taylor, tent-maker, carpenter, cook, hunt&s;|man,
and fi&s;herman, it is not probable that he will be ex|pert
at any of his callings. Hence the rude habita|tions,
furniture, cloathing, and implements of &s;avages;
<PB N="95" REF="131">
and the tedious length of time which all their operations
require.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e encourages, tho&s;e arts, by which the accom|modations
of human life are &s;upplied, by appropriating to
the arti&s;t the benefit of his di&s;coveries and improvements;
without which appropriation, ingenuity will never be ex|erted
with effect.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;everal accounts we may venture, with a
few exceptions, to pronounce, that even the poore&s;t and
the wor&s;t provided in countries where the property and the
con&s;equences of property prevail, are in a better &s;ituation,
with re&s;pect to food, raiment, hou&s;es and what are called
the nece&s;&s;aries of life, than <HI>any</HI> are, in places where mo&s;t
things remain in common. The balance therefore, upon
the whole, mu&s;t preponderate in favour of property with
a great exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Inequality of property in the degree in which it exi&s;ts
in mo&s;t countries of Europe, ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered, is
an evil: but it is an evil, which flows from tho&s;e rules,
concerning the acqui&s;ition and di&s;po&s;al of property, by
which men are incited to indu&s;try, and the object of their
indu&s;try is made &s;ecure and valuable. If there be any great
inequality unconnected with this origin, it ought to be
corrected.</P>

<PB N="96" REF="132">
<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Hi&s;tory of Property.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t objects of property were the fruits a man
plucked, and the wild animals he caught; next to
the&s;e, the tents or hou&s;es he built, the tools he made u&s;e
of to catch or prepare his food; and afterwards weapons of
war and offence. Many of the &s;avage tribes in North
America have got no farther than this yet; for they are &s;aid
to gather their harve&s;t, and return the produce of their
market with foreigners, into a common hoard or trea&s;ury
for the whole tribe. Flocks and herds of tame animals
&s;oon became property; <HI>Abel,</HI> the &s;econd from <HI>Adam,</HI> was
a keeper of &s;heep; &s;heep and oxen, and camels, and a&s;&s;es,
compo&s;ed the wealth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> patriarchs, as they do
&s;till of the modern <HI>Arabs.</HI> As the world was fir&s;t peopled
in the Ea&s;t, where there was a &s;carcity of water, wells
probably were next made property; as we learn, from the
frequent and &s;erious mention of them in the Old Te&s;ta|ment,
the contentions and treaties about them,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxi, 25. xxvi, 18.</NOTE> and from
it's being recorded, among&s;t the mo&s;t memorable atchieve|ments
of very eminent men, that they dug or di&s;covered a
well. Land, which is now &s;o important a part of proper|ty,
which alone our laws call <HI>real</HI> property, and re|gard
upon all occa&s;ions with &s;uch peculiar attention, was
probably not made property in any country, till long after
<PB N="97" REF="133">
the in&s;titution of many other &s;pecies of property, that is,
till the country became populous, and tillage began to be
thought of. The fir&s;t partition of an e&s;tate we read of,
was between <HI>Abram</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> and was one of the &s;imple&s;t
imaginable: &startq;If thou will take the left hand, then I
will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand,
then I will go to the left.&endq; There are no traces of property
in land in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s account of <HI>Britain;</HI> little of it in the
hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> patriarchs; none of it found among&s;t
the nations of <HI>North America;</HI> the <HI>Scythians</HI> are expre&s;&s;ly
&s;aid to have appropriated their cattle and hou&s;es, but to have
left their land in common. Property in immoveables con|tinued
at fir&s;t no longer than the occupation; that is, &s;o
long as a man's family continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a cave, and
his flocks depa&s;tured upon, a neighbouring hill, no one
attempted, or thought he had a right, to di&s;turb or drive
them out: but when the man quitted his cave, or changed
his pa&s;ture, the fir&s;t who found them unoccupied, entered
upon them, by the &s;ame title as his predece&s;&s;or; and made
way in his turn for any one that happened to &s;ucceed him.
All more permanent property in land, was probably po&s;te|rior
to civil government and to laws; and therefore &s;ettled
by the&s;e, or according to the will of the reigning chief.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="98" REF="134">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In what the Right of Property is founded.</HEAD>
<P>WE now &s;peak of Property in Land; and there is a
difficulty in explaining the origin of this property,
con&s;i&s;tently with the law of nature; for the land was once
no doubt common; and the que&s;tion is, how any particu|lar
part of it could ju&s;tly be taken out of the common,
and &s;o appropriated to the fir&s;t owner, as to give him a
better right to it than others; and, what, is more, a right
to exclude all others from it.</P>
<P>Morali&s;ts have given many different accounts of this
matter; which alone perhaps is a proof that none of
them are &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>One &s;ays, that mankind, when they &s;uffered a parti|cular
per&s;on to occupy a piece of ground, by a tacit con|&s;ent,
relinqui&s;hed their right to it; and, as the piece of
ground belonged to mankind collectively, and mankind
thus gave up their right to the fir&s;t peaceable occupier, it
thenceforward became his property, and no per&s;on after|wards
had a right to mole&s;t him in it.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="135">
The objection to this account is, that a man's con&s;ent
can never be pre&s;umed from his &s;ilence, where he knows
nothing about the matter; which mu&s;t have been the
ca&s;e with all mankind, except the neighbourhood of the
place where the appropriation was made. And to &s;uppo&s;e
that the piece of ground previou&s;ly belonged to the neigh|bourhood,
and that they had a ju&s;t power of conferring
a right to it upon whom they plea&s;ed, is to &s;uppo&s;e the
que&s;tion re&s;olved, and a partition of land to have already
taken place.</P>
<P>Another &s;ays, that each man's limbs and labour are his
own exclu&s;ively; that, by occupying a piece of ground,
a man in&s;eparably mixes his labour with it; by which
means the piece of ground becomes thenceforward his own,
as you cannot take it from him, without depriving him
at the &s;ame time of &s;omething, which is indi&s;putably <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>This is Mr. LOCKE'S &s;olution; and &s;eems indeed a fair
rea&s;on, where the value of the labour bears a con&s;idera|ble
proportion to the value of the thing; or where the
thing derives it's chief u&s;e and value from the labour.
Thus game and fi&s;h, though they be common, whil&s;t at
large in the woods or water, in&s;tantly become the pro|perty
of the per&s;on that catches them; becau&s;e an animal,
when caught, is much more valuable than when at li|berty;
and this increa&s;e of value, which is in&s;eparable
from, and makes a great part of the whole value, is
&s;trictly the property of the fowler, being the produce of
<PB N="100" REF="136">
his per&s;onal labour. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, wood or iron,
manufactured into uten&s;ils, become the property of the
manufacturer; becau&s;e the value of the workman&s;hip far
exceeds that of the materials. And upon a &s;imilar princi|ple,
a parcel of unappropriated ground, which a man
&s;hould pare, burn, plow, harrow, and &s;ow, for the pro|duction
of corn, would ju&s;tly enough be thereby made
his own. But this will hardly hold, in the manner it
has been applied, of taking a ceremonious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
a tract of land, as navigators do of new di&s;covered
i&s;lands, by erecting a &s;tandard, engraving an in&s;cription,
or publi&s;hing a proclamation, to the birds and bea&s;ts; or
of turning your cattle into a piece of ground, &s;etting up a
landmark, digging a ditch, or planting a hedge round it.
Nor will even the clearing, manuring, and plowing of a
field, give the fir&s;t occupier a right to it in perpetuity,
and after this, cultivation and all effects of it are cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another, and in my opinion, a better account of the
fir&s;t right of owner&s;hip, is the following: that, as God
has provided the&s;e things for the u&s;e of all, he has of
con&s;equence given each leave to take of them what he
wants; by virtue therefore of this leave, a man may ap|propriate
what he wants to his own u&s;e, without a&s;king,
or waiting for the con&s;ent of others; in like manner, as,
when an entertainment is provided for the freeholders of a
county, each freeholder goes, and eats and drinks, what
he wants, or chu&s;es, without having, or waiting for the
con&s;ent of the other gue&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="137">
But then, this rea&s;on ju&s;tifies property, as far as nece&s;|&s;aries
only, or, at the mo&s;t, a competent provi&s;ion for our
natural exigences. For, in the entertainment we &s;peak of
(allowing the compari&s;on to hold in all points), although
every particular freeholder may &s;it down and eat till he
be &s;atisfied, without any other, leave than that of the
ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, or any other proof of this leave, than
the general invitation, or the manife&s;t de&s;ign with which
the entertainment is provided; yet you would hardly per|mit
any one to fill his pockets or his wallet; or carry off
with him a quantity of provi&s;ion to hoard up, or wa&s;te,
or give his dogs, or &s;tew down into &s;auces, or convert into
articles of &s;uperfluous luxury; e&s;pecially, if by &s;o doing,
he pinched the gue&s;ts at the lower end of the table.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the accounts that have been given of the mat|ter,
by the be&s;t writers upon, the &s;ubject; but, were the&s;e
accounts le&s;s exceptionable than they are, they would none
of them, I fear, avail us in vindicating our pre&s;ent claims
of property in land, unle&s;s it were more probable than it is,
that our e&s;tates were actually acquired at fir&s;t, in &s;ome of
the ways which the&s;e accounts &s;uppo&s;e; and that a regular
regard had been had to ju&s;tice, in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
of them &s;ince: for if one link in the chain fail,
every title po&s;terior to it falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The real foundation of our right, is the law of the
land.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="138">
It is the intention of God, that the produce of the earth
be applied to the u&s;e of man; this intention cannot be ful|filled,
without e&s;tabli&s;hing property; it is con&s;i&s;tent there|fore
with his will, that property be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The land
cannot be divided into &s;eparate property, without leaving it
to the law of the country to regulate that divi&s;ion; it is
con&s;i&s;tent therefore with the &s;ame will, that the law &s;hould
regulate the divi&s;ion; and con&s;equently &startq;con&s;i&s;tent with
the will of God,&endq; or &startq;right&endq; that I &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s that
&s;hare which the&s;e regulations a&s;&s;ign me.</P>
<P>By whatever circuitous train of rea&s;oning you attempt to
derive this right, it mu&s;t terminate at la&s;t in the will of
God; the &s;traighte&s;t therefore, and &s;horte&s;t way of coming
at this will, is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that my right to an e&s;tate does not at
all depend upon the manner or ju&s;tice of the original acqui|&s;ition;
nor upon the ju&s;tice of every &s;ub&s;equent change of
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is not, for in&s;tance, the le&s;s, nor ought to be
impeached, becau&s;e the e&s;tate was taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, at
fir&s;t, by a family of aboriginal Britons, who happened to be
&s;tronger than their neighbours; nor becau&s;e the Briti&s;h po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
was turned out by a Roman, and the Roman by a
Saxon invader; or becau&s;e it was &s;eized, without colour of
right or rea&s;on, by a follower of the Norman adventurer;
from whom, after many interruptions of fraud and violence,
it has at length devolved to me.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="139">
Nor does the owner's right depend upon the <HI>expediency</HI> of
the law which gives it him. On one &s;ide of a brook, an
e&s;tate de&s;cends to the elde&s;t &s;on; on the other &s;ide, to
all the children alike. The right of the claimants under
both laws of inheritance is equal; though the expediency
of &s;uch oppo&s;ite rules mu&s;t needs be different.</P>
<P>The principles we have laid down upon this &s;ubject, ap|parently
tend to a conclu&s;ion, of which a bad u&s;e is apt to
be made. As the right of property depends upon the law
of the land, it &s;eems to follow, that a man has a right to
keep and take every thing, which the law will allow him
to keep and take: which in many ca&s;es, will authori&s;e the
mo&s;t manife&s;t and flagitious chicanery. If a creditor, upon
a &s;imple contract, neglect to demand his debt for &s;ix years,
the debtor may refu&s;e to pay it. Would it be <HI>right</HI> there|fore
to do &s;o, where he is con&s;cious of the ju&s;tice of the
debt? If a per&s;on, who is under twenty-one years of age,
contract a bargain (other than for nece&s;&s;aries), he may
avoid it by pleading his minority. But would this be a
fair plea, where, the bargain was; originally ju&s;t? The di|&s;tinction
to be taken in &s;uch ca&s;es is this. With the law,
we acknowledge, re&s;ides the di&s;po&s;al of property: &s;o long
therefore, as we keep within the de&s;ign and intention of a
law, that law will <HI>ju&s;tify us,</HI> as well <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae,</HI> as <HI>in
&s;oro humano,</HI> whatever be the equity or expediency of the
law it&s;elf. But When we convert to one purpo&s;e, a rule or
expre&s;&s;ion of law, which is intended for another purpo&s;e;
then, we plead in our ju&s;tification, not the intention of the
<PB N="104" REF="140">
law, but the words; that is, we plead a dead letter, which
can &s;ignify nothing: for words <HI>without</HI> meaning or inten|tion
have no force or effect in ju&s;tice, much le&s;s words
taken <HI>contrary</HI> to the meaning and intention of the &s;peaker
or writer. To apply this distinction to the examples ju&s;t now
propo&s;ed; in order to protect men again&s;t antiquated de|mands,
from which it is not probable they &s;hould have
pre&s;erved the evidence of their di&s;charge, the law pre|&s;cribes
a limited time to certain &s;pecies of private &s;ecurities,
beyond which, it will not enforce them, or lend it's a&s;&s;i&s;&s;t|ance
the recovery of the debt. If a man be ignorant, or
dubious of the ju&s;tice of the demand made upon him, he
may con&s;cientiou&s;ly plead this limitation; becau&s;e <HI>he ap|plies
the rule of law to the purpo&s;e for which it was intended.</HI>
But when he refu&s;es to pay a debt, of the reality of which
he is con&s;cious; he cannot, as before, plead the intention of
the &s;tatute, and the &s;upreme authority of law, unle&s;s he
could &s;hew, that the law <HI>intended</HI> to interpo&s;e it's &s;upreme
authority, to acquit men of debts, of the exi&s;tence and
ju&s;tice of which they were them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible. Again, to
pre&s;erve youth from the practices and impo&s;itions, to which
their inexperience expo&s;es them, the law compells the pay|ment
of no debts incurred within a certain age, nor the per|formance
of any engagements, except for &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries
as are &s;uited to their condition and fortunes. If a young
per&s;on therefore perceive that he has been practiced or im|po&s;ed
upon, he may hone&s;tly avail him&s;elf of the privilege
of his non-age, to defeat the circumvention. But, if he
&s;helter him&s;elf under this privilege, to avoid a fair oblige|tion,
<PB N="105" REF="141">
or equitable contract, he extends the privilege to a ca&s;e,
in which it is not allowed by intention of law, and in which,
con&s;equently it does not, in natural ju&s;tice, exi&s;t.</P>
<P>As property is the principal &s;ubject of Ju&s;tice, or &startq;of
the determinate relative duties,&endq; we have put down what
we had to &s;ay upon it in the fir&s;t place: we now proceed
to &s;tate the&s;e duties in the be&s;t order we can.</P>

</LIST>
<P>I. Whence the obligation to perform promi&s;es ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who argue from innate moral principles, &s;uppo&s;e
a &s;en&s;e of the obligation of promi&s;es to be one of them;
<PB N="106" REF="142">
but without a&s;&s;uming this, or any thing el&s;e, without
proof, the obligation to perform promi&s;es, may be deduced
from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a conduct, to the Well being, or
the exi&s;tence indeed, of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Men act from their expectations. The&s;e expectations
are in mo&s;t ca&s;es determined by the a&s;&s;urances and engage|ments
we receive from, others. If no dependance could be
placed upon the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
know, what judgment to form of many future events, or
how to regulate our conduct with re&s;pect to them. Con|fidence
therefore in promi&s;es, is e&s;&s;ential to the intercour&s;e
of human life; becau&s;e, without it, the greate&s;t part of
our conduct would proceed upon chance. But there could
be no confidence in promi&s;es, if men were not obliged to
perform them: the obligation therefore to perform pro|mi&s;es
is e&s;&s;ential, to the &s;ame end, and in the &s;ame degree.</P>
<P>Some may imagine, that, if this obligation were &s;u&s;pended,
a general caution, and mutual di&s;tru&s;t would en&s;ue, which
might do as well; but this is imagined, without con&s;ider|ing,
how every hour of our lives we tru&s;t to, and depend
upon others; and how impo&s;&s;ible it is, to &s;tir a &s;tep, or,
what is wor&s;e, to &s;it &s;till a moment without &s;uch tru&s;t and
dependance. I am now writing at my ea&s;e, not doubting
(or rather never thinking and therefore never thinking
about it) but that the butcher will &s;end in the joint of
meat, which I ordered; that his &s;ervant will bring it; that
my cook will dre&s;s it; that my footman will &s;erve at up;
<PB N="107" REF="143">
and that I &s;hall find it upon table at one o'clock. Yet
have I nothing for all this, but the promi&s;e of the butcher,
and the implied promi&s;e of his &s;ervant and mine. And the
&s;ame holds, of the mo&s;t important, as well as the mo&s;t fa|miliar
occurrences of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>II. In what &s;en&s;e promi&s;es are to be interpreted.</P>
<P>Where the terms of a promi&s;e admit of more &s;en&s;es than
one, the promi&s;e is to be performed in that &s;en&s;e in which
the promi&s;er apprehended at the time that the promi&s;ee re|ceived
it.</P>
<P>It is not the &s;en&s;e in which the promi&s;er actually in|tended
it, that always governs the interpretation of an
aequivocal promi&s;e; for, at that rate, you might excite ex|pectations,
which you never meant, nor would be obliged,
to &s;atisfy. Much le&s;s is it the &s;en&s;e, in which the pro|mi&s;ee
actually received the promi&s;e; according to that rule,
you might be drawn into engagements which you never
de&s;igned to undertake. It mu&s;t therefore be the &s;en&s;e (for
there is no other remaining) in which the promi&s;ee believed
that the promi&s;ee accepted his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>This will be the &s;ame as the actual intention of the promi|&s;er,
where the promi&s;e is given without collu&s;ion or re&s;erve;
but we put the rule in this form, to exclude eva&s;ion, where
the popular meaning of a phra&s;e, and the &s;trict gramma|tical
&s;ignification of the words differ, or, in general, where
<PB N="108" REF="144">
the promi&s;er attempts to make his e&s;cape through &s;ome
ambiguity in the expre&s;&s;ions he u&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Temures</HI> promi&s;ed the garri&s;on of <HI>Seba&s;tia,</HI> that, if they
would &s;urrender, <HI>no blood &s;hould be &s;hed.</HI> The garri&s;on &s;ur|rendered;
and <HI>Temures</HI> buried them all alive. Now <HI>Temures</HI>
fulfilled the promi&s;e, in one &s;en&s;e, and in the &s;en&s;e too
in which he intended it at the time; but not in the &s;en&s;e
in which the garri&s;on of <HI>Seba&s;tia</HI> actually received it, nor
in the &s;en&s;e in which <HI>Temures</HI> him&s;elf knew that the gar|ri&s;on
received it; which la&s;t &s;en&s;e, according to our rule,
was the &s;en&s;e he was in con&s;cience bound to have per|formed
it in.</P>
<P>From the account we have given of the obligation of
promi&s;es, it is evident, that this obligation depends upon
the expectations which we <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>voluntarily</HI> excite.
Con&s;equently any action or conduct towards. another,
which we are &s;en&s;ible excites expectations in that other,
is as much a promi&s;e, and creates as &s;trict an obligation,
as the mo&s;t expre&s;s a&s;&s;urances. Taking, for in&s;tance, a
relation's child, and educating him for a liberal profe&s;&s;ion,
or in a manner &s;uitable only for the heir of a large fortune,
as much obliges us, to place him in that profe&s;&s;ion, or
leave him &s;uch a fortune, as if we had given him a pro|mi&s;e
to do &s;o, under our hands and &s;eals. In like manner,
a great man, who encourages an indigent retainer; or a
mini&s;ter of &s;tate, who di&s;tingui&s;hes and care&s;&s;es at his levee,
one who is in a &s;ituation to be obliged by his patronage,
<PB N="109" REF="145">
engages, by &s;uch behaviour, to provide for him.&mdash;This is
the foundation of <HI>tacit promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>You may either, declare your pre&s;ent intention &s;imply;
or you may accompany your declaration with an engage|ment
to abide by it, which con&s;titutes a complete promi&s;e.
In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the duty is &s;atisfied, if you were &s;incere,
that is, if you entertained at the time, the intention you
expre&s;&s;ed, however &s;oon, or for whatever rea&s;on, you af|terwards
change it. In the latter ca&s;e, you have parted
with the liberty of changing. All this is plain; but it
mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e forms of &s;peech,
which, &s;trictly taken, amount to no more than declara|rations
of pre&s;ent intention, do yet, in the u&s;ual way of
under&s;tanding them, excite the expectation, and there|fore
carry with them the force, of ab&s;olute promi&s;es. Such
as, &startq;I intend you this place&endq;&mdash;&startq;I de&s;ign to leave you
this e&s;tate&endq;&mdash;&startq;I purpo&s;e giving you my vote&endq;&mdash;&startq;I mean
to &s;erve you.&endq;&mdash;In which, although the &startq;intention,&endq; the
&startq;de&s;ign,&endq; the &startq;purpo&s;e,&endq; the &startq;meaning,&endq; be expre&s;&s;ed in
words of the pre&s;ent time, yet you cannot afterwards
change them, without a breach of good faith. If you have
a mind therefore to make known your pre&s;ent intention,
and yet to re&s;erve to your&s;elf the liberty of changing it;
you mu&s;t guard your expre&s;&s;ions by an additional clau&s;e,
as &startq;I intend <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI>&endq;&mdash;<HI>if I don't alter</HI>&mdash;or the like&mdash;and
after all, as there can be no rea&s;on for di&s;clo&s;ing your in|tention,
but to excite &s;ome degree of expectation or other,
a wanton change of an intention which is once di&s;clo&s;ed,
<PB N="110" REF="146">
always di&s;appoints &s;omebody; and is always, for that rea|&s;on,
wrong.</P>
<P>There is, in &s;ome men, an infirmity with regard to
promi&s;es, which often betrays them into great di&s;tre&s;s.
From the confu&s;ion, or he&s;itation, or ob&s;curity, with
which they expre&s;s them&s;elves, e&s;pecially when overawed,
or taken by &s;urpri&s;e, they &s;ometimes encourage expecta|tions,
and bring upon them&s;elves demands, which, po&s;|&s;ibly,
they never dreamed of.&mdash;This is a want, not &s;o
much of integrity, as of pre&s;ence of mind.</P>
<P>III. In what ca&s;es promi&s;es are not binding.</P>
<P>1. Promi&s;es are not binding, where the performance is
<HI>impo&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>But ob&s;erve, that the promi&s;er is guilty of a fraud,
when he is privately aware of the impo&s;&s;ibility, at the
time of making the promi&s;e. For when any one promi&s;es
a thing, he a&s;&s;erts his belief, at lea&s;t, of the po&s;&s;ibility of
performing it; as no one can accept or under&s;tand the
promi&s;e under any other &s;uppo&s;ition. In&s;tances of this
&s;ort are the following. The mini&s;ter promi&s;es a place,
which he knows to be engaged, or not at his di&s;po&s;al&mdash;A
father, in &s;ettling marriage articles, promi&s;es to leave his
<PB N="111" REF="147">
daughter an e&s;tate, which he knows to be entailed upon
the heir male of his family&mdash;A merchant promi&s;es with
his daughter a &s;hip, or &s;hare of a &s;hip, which he is pri|vately
advi&s;ed is lo&s;t at &s;ea&mdash;An incumbent promi&s;es to re|&s;ign
a living, being, well a&s;&s;ured, that his re&s;ignation will
not be accepted by the Bi&s;hop. The promi&s;er, as in the&s;e
ca&s;es, with knowledge of the impo&s;&s;ibility, is ju&s;tly an|&s;werable
in an equivalent; but otherwi&s;e not.</P>
<P>When the promi&s;er him&s;elf occa&s;ions the impo&s;&s;ibility,
it is neither more nor le&s;s than a direct breach of the pro|mi&s;e;
as when a &s;oldier maims, or a &s;ervant di&s;ables him|&s;elf,
to get rid of their engagements.</P>
<P>2. Promi&s;es are not binding, where the performance is
<HI>unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>There are two ca&s;es of this; one, where the unlawful|ne&s;s
is known to the parties, at the time of making the
promi&s;e; as where an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in promi&s;es to di&s;patch your
rival or your enemy&mdash;a &s;ervant to betray his ma&s;ter&mdash;a
pimp to procure a mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;or a <HI>friend</HI> to give his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
in a &s;cheme of &s;eduction. The parties in the&s;e ca&s;es
are not obliged to perform what the promi&s;e requires, <HI>be|cau&s;e
they were under a prior obligation to the contrary.</HI> From
which prior obligation what is there to di&s;charge them?
their promi&s;e&mdash;their own act and deed&mdash;but an obligation,
from which a man can di&s;charge him&s;elf, by his own act
and deed, is no obligation, at all. The guilt therefore of
<PB N="112" REF="148">
&s;uch promi&s;es is in the making, not in the breaking them;
and if, in the interval betwixt the promi&s;e and the per|formance,
a mail &s;o far recover his reflection, as to repent
of his engagements, he ought certainly to break through
them.</P>
<P>The other ca&s;e is, where the unlawfulne&s;s did not ex|i&s;t,
or was not known, at the time of making the promi&s;e;
as where a merchant promi&s;es his corre&s;pondent abroad,
to &s;end him a &s;hip load of corn, at a time appointed, and
before the time arrives, an embargo is laid upon the ex|portation
of corn&mdash;A woman gives a promi&s;e of marriage;
before the marriage, &s;he di&s;covers that her intended hu&s;|band
is too near a-kin to her, or has a wife yet living. In
all &s;uch ca&s;es, where the contrary does not appear, it mu&s;t
he pre&s;umed, that the parties &s;uppo&s;ed, what they pro|mi&s;ed
to be lawful, and proceeded entirely upon this &s;up|po&s;ition.
The lawfulne&s;s therefore becomes a condition
of the promi&s;e; and where the condition fails, the obli|gation
cea&s;es. Of the &s;ame nature was Herod's promi&s;e
to his daughter-in-law, &startq;that he would give her what|ever
&s;he a&s;ked, even to the half of his kingdom.&endq; The
promi&s;e was not unlawful, in the terms, in which Herod
delivered it; and when it became &s;o by the daughter's
choice, by her demanding &startq;JOHN the Bapti&s;t's head,&endq;
Herod was di&s;charged from the obligation of it, for the
rea&s;on now laid down, as well as for that given in the la&s;t
paragraph.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="149">
This rule, &startq;that promi&s;es are void, where the perform|ance
is unlawful,&endq; extends al&s;o to imperfect obligations;
for the rea&s;on of the rule holds of all obligations. Thus,
if you promi&s;e a man a place, or your vote, and he after|wards
render him&s;elf unfit to receive either, you are ab|&s;olved
from the obligation of your promi&s;e; or, if a bet|ter
candidate appear, and it be a ca&s;e in which you are
bound by oath, or otherwi&s;e, to govern your&s;elf by the
qualification, the promi&s;e mu&s;t be broken through.</P>
<P>And here I would recommend, to young per&s;ons e&s;pe|cially,
a caution, from the neglect of which, many in|volve
them&s;elves in embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;grace; and that
is, &startq;never to give a promi&s;e which may interfere in
the event with their duty;&endq; for, if it do &s;o interfere,
the duty mu&s;t be di&s;charged, though at the expence of
their promi&s;e, and the peril of their good name.</P>
<P>The &s;pecific performance of a promi&s;e is reckoned a per|fect
obligation. And many ca&s;ui&s;ts have laid it down, in
oppo&s;ition to what has been here a&s;&s;erted, that, where a
perfect and an imperfect, obligation cla&s;h, the perfect obli|gation
is to be preferred. For which opinion however,
there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on, but what ari&s;es from the
terms &startq;perfect&endq; and &startq;imperfect,&endq; the impropriety of
which has been remarked above. The truth is, of two
contradictory obligations, that ought to prevail, which is
prior in point of time.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="150">
It is the <HI>performance</HI> being unlawful, and not any un|lawfulne&s;s
in the &s;ubject or motive of the promi&s;e, which
de&s;troys it's validity; therefore a bribe, after the vote is
given; the wages of pro&s;titution; the reward of any
crime, after the crime is committed, ought, if promi&s;ed,
to be paid. For the &s;in and mi&s;chief, by this &s;uppo&s;ition,
are over, and will be neither more nor le&s;s for the per|formance
of the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>In like manner, a promi&s;e does not lo&s;e it's obligation,
merely becau&s;e it proceeded from an <HI>unlawful motive.</HI> A
certain per&s;on, in the life-time of his wife, who was then
&s;ick, paid his addre&s;&s;es, and, promi&s;ed marriage to another
woman&mdash;the wife died; and the, woman demanded per|formance,
of the promi&s;e. The man, who, it &s;eems, had
changed his mind, either felt or pretended, doubts concern|ing
the obligation of &s;uch a promi&s;e, and referred his
ca&s;e to bi&s;hop SANDERSON, the mo&s;t eminent in this kind
of knowledge, of his time. Bi&s;hop SANDERSON, after
writing a di&s;&s;ertation upon the que&s;tion, adjudged the pro|mi&s;e
to be void. In which however, upon our principles,
he was wrong; for, however criminal the affection might
be, which induced the promi&s;e, the performance, when
it was demanded, was lawful; which, is the only lawful|ne&s;s required.</P>
<P>A promi&s;e cannot be deemed unlawful, where it pro|duces,
when performed, no effect beyond what would
have taken place, had the promi&s;e never been made. And
<PB N="115" REF="151">
this is the &s;ingle ca&s;e, in which the obligation of pro|mise
will ju&s;tify a conduct, which, unless it had been pro|mised,
would be unjust. A captive, may lawfully recover
his liberty, by a promise of neutrality; for his conqueror
takes nothing by the promise, which he might not have
&s;ecured by his death or confinement: and neutrality
would be innocent in him, although criminal in another.
It is manife&s;t, however, that promi&s;es, which come into
the place of coercion, can extend no farther than to pa&s;|&s;ive
compliances; for coercion itself could compell no
more. Upon the &s;ame principle, promi&s;es of &s;ecre&s;y ought
not to be violated, although the public would derive ad|vantage
from the di&s;covery. Such promi&s;es contain no un|lawfulne&s;s
in them, to de&s;troy their obligation; for, as
the information would not have been; imparted upon any
other condition, the public lo&s;e nothing by the promi&s;e,
which they would have gained without it.</P>
<P>3. Promises are not binding, where they contradict a
former promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Because the performance is then unlawful, which re|&s;olves
this ca&s;e into the la&s;t.</P>
<P>4. Promi&s;es are not binding before acceptance; that is,
before notice given to the promi&s;ee; for, where the pro|mi&s;e
is beneficial, acceptance may be pre&s;umed. Before
the promi&s;e be communicated to the promi&s;ee, it is the
<PB N="116" REF="152">
&s;ame only, as a re&s;olution in the mind of the promi&s;er, which may be altered at plea&s;ure. For no expectation has
been excited, therefore none can be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e I declare, my intention to: a third per&s;on,
who, without any authority from me, conveys my decla|ration
to the promi&s;ee; is that &s;uch a notice as will be
binding upon me? It certainly is not: for I have not <HI>vo|luntarily
excited any expectation,</HI> which is of the e&s;&s;ence of a
promi&s;e.</P>
<P>5. Promi&s;es are not binding, which are relea&s;ed by the
promi&s;ee.</P>
<P>This is evident; but it may be &s;ometimes doubted who
is the promi&s;ee. If I give a promise <HI>to</HI> A, of a place or vote
for B; as to a father for his &s;on; to an uncle for his ne|phew;
to a friend of mine, for a relation or friend of his;
then A is the promi&s;ee, who&s;e con&s;ent I mu&s;t obtain, to re|lea&s;e
me from the engagement.</P>
<P>If I promi&s;e a place or vote to B <HI>by</HI> A, that is, if A be
a me&s;&s;enger to convey the promi&s;e, as if &s;hould, &s;ay, &startq;you may tell B, that he &s;hall have this place, or may depend
upon my vote;&endq; or if A be employed to introduce B's
reque&s;t, and I an&s;wer in any terms which amount to a com|pliance
with it, then B is the promi&s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="153">
Promi&s;es to one per&s;on, for the benefit of another, are
not relea&s;ed by the death of the promi&s;ee. For his death
neither makes the performance impracticable, nor implies
any con&s;ent to relea&s;e the promi&s;er from it.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Erroneous</HI> promi&s;es are not binding in certain ca&s;es;
as,</P>
<P>1. Where the error proceeds from the mistake or mi&s;re-pre&s;entation
of the promi&s;ee.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e a promi&s;e evidently &s;uppo&s;es the truth of the ac|count
which the promi&s;ee relates, in order to obtain it. A
beggar &s;olicits your charity, by a &s;tory of the mo&s;t pitiable
di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;you promi&s;e to relieve him, if he will call again&mdash;in the interval you di&s;cover his &s;tory to be made up of
iies&mdash;this di&s;covery, no doubt, relea&s;es you from your pro|mi&s;e.
One who wants your &s;ervice, de&s;cribes the bu&s;ine&s;s
or office he would engage you for&mdash;you promi&s;e to under|take
it&mdash;when you come to enter upon it, you find the
profits le&s;s, the labour more, or &s;ome material circum|&s;tance
different from the account he gave you&mdash;In &s;uch ca&s;e
you are not bound by your promi&s;e.</P>
<P>2. When the promi&s;e is under&s;tood by the promi&s;ee, to
proceed upon a certain &s;uppo&s;ition; or when the promi&s;er
thought he so under&s;tood it; and that &s;uppo&s;ition turns out
to be fal&s;e; then the promise is not binding.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="154">
This intricate rule will be be&s;t explained by an example.
A father receives an account, from abroad, of the death of
his only &s;on&mdash;&s;oon after which, he promi&s;es his fortune to
his nephew&mdash;the account turns out to be fal&s;e&mdash;the father,
we &s;ay, is relea&s;ed from his promi&s;e; not merely becau&s;e he
never would have made it, had he known the truth of
the ca&s;e&mdash;for that alone won't do&mdash;but becau&s;e the ne|phew
al&s;o him&s;elf under&s;tood the promi&s;e to proceed upon
the &s;uppo&s;ition of his cou&s;in's death; or at lea&s;t his
uncle thought he so under&s;tood it; and could not think other|wi&s;e.&mdash;The
promi&s;e proceeded upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, in the
promi&s;er's own apprehen&s;ion, and, as he believed, in the
apprehension of both parties; and this belief of his is the
preci&s;e circum&s;tance which &s;ets him free. The foundation
of the rule is plainly this, a man is bound only to &s;atisfy
the expectation which he intended to excite; whatever con|dition
therefore he intended to &s;ubject that expectation to,
becomes an e&s;&s;ential condition of the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Errors, which come not within this de&s;cription, do not
annul the obligation of a promi&s;e. I promi&s;e a candidate
my vote&mdash;pre&s;ently another candidate pre&s;ents him&s;elf, for
whom I certainly would have re&s;erved it, had I been ac|quainted
with his de&s;ign. Here therefore, as before, my
promi&s;e proceeded from an error; and I never &s;hould have
given &s;uch a promi&s;e, had I been aware of the truth of the
ca&s;e, as it has turned out&mdash;but the <HI>promi&s;ee</HI> did not know
this&mdash;<HI>he</HI> did not receive the promi&s;e, subject to any &s;uch
condition, or as proceeding from any &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition&mdash;nor
<PB N="119" REF="155">
did I at the time imagine he so received it&mdash;-This error,
therefore, of mine, must fall upon my own head, and The
promi&s;e be ob&s;erved notwith&s;tanding. A father promi&s;es
a certain fortune with his daughter, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf to
be worth &s;o much&mdash;his circum&s;tances turn out upon ex|amination,
wor&s;e than he was aware of. Here again the
promi&s;e was erroneous, but, for the rea&s;on, a&s;&s;igned in the
la&s;t ca&s;e, will neverthele&s;s be obligatory.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of erroneous promi&s;es, is attended with &s;ome
difficulty; for to allow every mi&s;take, or change of circum|&s;tances,
to di&s;&s;olve the obligation of a promi&s;e, would be
to allow a latitude, which might evacuate the force of al|l
mo&s;t all promi&s;es: and, on the other hand, to gird the obli|gation
&s;o tight, as to make no allowances for manife&s;t, and
fundamental errors, would, in many in&s;tances, be produc|tive
of great hard&s;hip and ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>It has long been controverted among&s;t morali&s;ts, whe|ther
promi&s;es are binding, which are extorted by violence
or fear. The obligation of all promi&s;es re&s;ults, we have
&s;een, from the nece&s;&s;ity, or the u&s;e, of that confidence,
which mankind repo&s;e in them. The que&s;tion, therefore,
whether, the&s;e promi&s;es are binding, will depend upon this,
whether mankind upon the whole, are benefited by the
confidence placed in such promi&s;es? A highwayman at|tacks
you&mdash;and being di&s;appointed of his booty, threatens
or prepares to murder you&mdash;you promi&s;e, with many &s;o|lemn
<PB N="120" REF="156">
a&s;&s;verations, that, if he will &s;pare your life, he &s;hall
find a pur&s;e of money left for him, at a place appointed&mdash;upon&punc;
the faith of this promi&s;e, he forbears from farther
violence. Now your life was &s;aved by the confidence re|po&s;ed
in a promi&s;e, extorted by fear; and the lives of many
others may be &s;aved by the &s;ame. The promi&s;e, therefore,
it &s;hould &s;eem, ought to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>There are other ca&s;es which are plainer; as where a
magi&s;trate confines a di&s;turber of the public peace in jail,
till he promi&s;e to behave better; or a pri&s;oner of war pro|mi&s;es,
if &s;et at liberty, to return within a certain time.
The&s;e promi&s;es, &s;ay morali&s;ts, are binding, becau&s;e the
violence or dure&s;s is ju&s;t; but, the truth is, becau&s;e there
is the &s;ame u&s;e of confidence in the&s;e promi&s;es, as of con|fidence
in the promi&s;es of a per&s;on at perfect liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Vows</HI> are promi&s;es to God. Their obligation cannot be
made out upon the &s;ame principle as that of other pro|mi&s;es.
The violation of them however implies, and in|&s;pires,
a want of reverence to the Supreme Being; which
is enough to make it &s;inful.</P>
<P>There is no command or encouragement in the Chri&s;ti|an
&s;criptures to make vows; much le&s;s any authority to
break through them, when they are made. The few in|&s;tances<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts. xviii. 18. xxi. 23.</NOTE>
<PB N="121" REF="157">
of vows we read of in the New Te&s;tament, were
religiously ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The rules we have laid down concerning promi&s;es, are
applicable to vows. Thus Jephthah's vow, taking it in the
&s;en&s;e in which that tran&s;action is commonly under&s;tood,
was not binding; becau&s;e the performance, in that contin|gency,
became unlawful.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts, of Sale.</HEAD>
<P>THE rule of ju&s;tice, which wants, most to be incul|cated,
in the making bargains, is, that the &s;eller
is bound in con&s;cience to di&s;close the faults of what he
offers to &s;ale. Among&s;t other methods of proving this,
one may be the following:</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will be allowed, that to advance a direct
fal&s;ehood in recommendation of our wares, by a&s;cribing to
<PB N="123" REF="159">
them &s;ome quality, which, we know, they have not, is di&s;|hone&s;t.
Now compare with this the de&s;igned concealment
of &s;ame fault, which we know, they have. The motives
and the effects of actions are the only points of compa|ri&s;on,
in which their, moral quality can differ; but the mo|tive
in the&s;e two ca&s;es is the &s;ame, viz. to procure higher
price than we expect otherwi&s;e to obtain; the effect, that
is, the prejudice to the buyer, is al&s;o the &s;ame; for he
finds him&s;elf equally, put of pocket by his bargain, whe|ther
the commodity, when he gets home with it, turn out
wor&s;e than he had &s;uppo&s;ed, by the want of &s;ome quality
which he expected, or the di&s;covery of &s;ome fault which
he did not expert. If therefore actions be the &s;ame as to all
moral purpo&s;es, which proceed from the &s;ame motives, and
produce the &s;ame effects; it is making a di&s;tinction with|out
a difference, to e&s;teem it a cheat, to magnify, beyond
the truth, the virtues of what we have to fell; but none
to conceal it's faults.</P>
<P>It adds to the value of this kind of hone&s;ty, that the
faults of many things are of a nature not to be known by
any, but the per&s;ons that have u&s;ed them: &s;o that the
buyer has no &s;ecurity from impo&s;ition, but in the ing&eacute;nue|ou&s;ne&s;s
and integrity of the &s;eller.</P>
<P>There is one exception, however, to this rule, where
the &s;ilence of the &s;eller implies &s;ome fault in the thing to
be &s;old; and where the buyer has a compen&s;ation in the
price, for the ri&s;k he runs: as where a hor&s;e, in a London
<PB N="124" REF="160">
repo&s;itory, is &s;old by public auction, without warranty; the
want of warranty is notice of &s;ome un&s;oundne&s;s, and pro|duces
a proportionable abatement in the price.</P>
<P>To this of concealing the faults of what we want to put
off, may be referred, the practice of pa&s;&s;ing; bad money;
which mo&s;t people will confe&s;s to be wrong, not with&s;tand|ing
the vulgar excu&s;e, that you have taken it for good, and
mu&s;t therefore get rid of it Which excu&s;e is much the
&s;ame, as if one, who had been robbed upon the highway,
&s;hould imagine he had a right to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf out of
the pocket of the fir&s;t traveller he met; the ju&s;tice of
which rea&s;oning the traveller po&s;&s;ibly may not com|prehend.</P>
<P>Where there is no monopoly or combination, the mar|ket
price is always a fair price; becau&s;e it will always be
proportionable to the u&s;e and &s;carcity of the article.
Hence, there need be no &s;cruple about demanding, or tak|ing
the market price; and all tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, &startq;provi|&s;ions
are extravagantly dear,&endq; &startq;corn bears an unrea&s;on|able
price,&endq; and the like, import no unfairne&s;s or unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s
in the &s;eller.</P>
<P>If your taylor or your draper charge, or even a&s;k you
more for a &s;uit of cloaths, than the market price, you com|plain
that you are impo&s;ed upon; you pronounce the man
who makes &s;uch a charge di&s;hone&s;t: although, as the
trade&s;man's goods were his own, and he had a right to
<PB N="125" REF="161">
pre&s;cribe the terms, upon which he would con&s;ent to part
with them, it may be que&s;tioned what di&s;hone&s;ty there
can be in the ca&s;e, and where in the impo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts.
Whoever opens a &s;hop, or in any manner expo&s;es goods to
public &s;ale, virtually engages to deal with his cu&s;tomers at
a market price; becau&s;e it is upon the faith and idea &s;uch
an engagement, that any one comes within his &s;hop doors,
or offers to treat with him. This is expected by the buyer;
is known to be &s;o expected by the &s;eller; which is enough,
according to the rule delivered above, to make it a part of
the contract between them, though not a &s;yllable be &s;aid
about it. The breach of this implied contract con&s;titutes
the fraud enquired after.</P>
<P>Hence, if you di&s;claim any &s;uch engagement, you may
&s;et what value you plea&s;e upon your property. If, upon
being a&s;ked to &s;ell a hou&s;e, you an&s;wer that the hou&s;e &s;uits
your fancy or conveniency, and that you will not turn
your&s;elf out of it, under &s;uch a price; the price fixed may
be double of what the hou&s;e co&s;t, or would fetch at a public
&s;ale, without any imputation of inju&s;tice or extortion upon
you.</P>
<P>If the tiling fold be damaged, or peri&s;h, between the &s;ale and
the delivery, ought the buyer to bear the lo&s;s, or the
&s;eller? This will depend upon the con&s;truction of the con|tract.
If the &s;eller, either expre&s;sly, or by implication, or
by cu&s;tom, engage to <HI>deliver</HI> the goods; as if I buy a &s;et of
china, and the china-man a&s;k me whither he &s;hall bring
<PB N="126" REF="162">
or &s;end them to, and they are broken in the conveyance;
the &s;eller mu&s;t abide by the lo&s;s. If the thing &s;old remain
with the &s;eller, at the in&s;tance, or for the conveniency of
the buyer; then the buyer undertakes the ri&s;k; as if I buy
a hor&s;e, and mention, that I will &s;end for it on &s;uch a
day, which is in effect, de&s;iring that it may continue with
the &s;eller till I do &s;end for it; then, whatever mi&s;fortune
befalls the hor&s;e in the meantime, mu&s;t be at my co&s;t.</P>
<P>And here, once for all, I would ob&s;erve, that innume|rable
que&s;tions of this &s;ort are determined &s;olely by <HI>cu&s;tom;</HI>
not that cu&s;tom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any proper authority to alter or
a&s;certain the nature of right and wrong; but becau&s;e the
contracting parties are pre&s;umed to include in their &s;tipu|lation,
all the conditions which cu&s;tom has annexed to
contracts of the &s;ame &s;ort: and when the u&s;age is noto|rious,
and no exception made to it, this pre&s;umption is
generally agreeable to the fact.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It happens here, as many ca&s;es, that what the parties ought to do, and what a judge or arbitrator would award to be done, may be very differ|rent. What the parties ought to do, by virtue of their contract, depends upon their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, at the time of making it: whereas a third per&s;on finds it nece&s;&s;ary to found his judgment upon pre&s;umptions, which pre&s;ump|tions may be fal&s;e, although the mo&s;t probable that he could proceed by.</NOTE></P>

<P>BY Contracts of Hazard, I mean gaming; and in&s;u|rance.</P>
<P>What &s;ome &s;ay of this kind of contracts, &startq;that one
&s;ide ought not to have any advantage over the other,&endq; is
neither practicable nor true. It is not practicable; for that
perfect equality of &s;kill and judgment, which this rule re|quires,
is &s;eldom to be met with. I might not have it in
my power to play a game at cards, billiards, or tennis;
lay a wager at a hor&s;e race; or underwrite a policy of
in&s;urance, once in a twelvemonth; if I mu&s;t wait till I
meet with a per&s;on, who&s;e art, &s;kill, and judgment, in
the&s;e matters, is neither greater nor le&s;s than my own.
Nor is this equality requi&s;ite to the justice of the contract.
One party, may give to the other the whole of the &s;take,
<PB N="128" REF="164">
if he plea&s;e; and the other party may ju&s;tly accept it, if
it be given him; much more therefore may one give to
the other a &s;take or the or, what is exactly the &s;ame
thing, an advantage in the chance of winning the whole.</P>
<P>The proper re&s;triction is, that neither &s;ide have an ad|vantage,
by means which the other is not aware of; for
this is an advantage taken, without being <HI>given.</HI> Although
the event be &s;till an uncertainty, your advantage in the
chance has a certain value; and &s;o much of the &s;take, as
that value amounts to, is taken from your adver&s;ary with|out
his knowledge, and therefore without his con&s;ent.
If I &s;it down to a game at whi&s;t, and have an advantage
over the adver&s;ary, by means of a better memory, clo&s;er
attention, or a &s;uperior knowledge of the rules and chances
of the game, the advantage is fair; becau&s;e it is obtained
by means which the adver&s;ary is aware of; for he is
aware, when he &s;its down with me, that I &s;hall exert the
&s;kill that I po&s;&s;e&s;s, to the utmo&s;t. But if I gain an ad|vantage
by packing the cards, glancing my eye into the
adver&s;aries hands, or by concerted &s;ignals with my part|ner,
it is a di&s;hone&s;t advantage; becau&s;e it depends upon
means, which the adver&s;ary never becau&s;e that I make
u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;tinction holds of all contracts, into which

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of lending of incon&s;umable Property.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the identical loan is to be returned, as a
book, a hor&s;e, a harp&s;ichord, it is called <HI>incon|&s;umable</HI>
in oppo&s;ition to corn, wine, money, and tho&s;e
things which peri&s;h or are parted with in the u&s;e, and
can therefore only be returned, in kind.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions under this head are few and &s;imple. The
fir&s;t is, if the thing lent be lo&s;t or damaged, who ought to bear
the lo&s;s or damage? If it be damaged by the u&s;e, or by
accident in the u&s;e for which it was lent, the lender mu&s;t
bear it; as if I hire a job-coach, the wear, tear, and &s;oil|ing
of the coach, mu&s;t belong to the lender; or a hor&s;e to
go a particular journey, and in going the propo&s;ed journey,
the hor&s;e die, or be lamed, the lo&s;s mu&s;t be the lender's:
on the contrary, if the damage be occa&s;ioned by the fault
of the borrower, or by, accident in &s;ome u&s;e for which it
was not lent; then the borrower mu&s;t make, it good; as if
the coach be overturned by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of your drun|ken
coachman, or broken to pieces; or the hor&s;e be hired
to take a morning's ride upon, and you go a hunting with
him, or leap him over hedges, or put him into your cart,
<PB N="131" REF="167">
or carriage, and he be &s;trained, or &s;taked, or galled, or
accidentally hurt, or drop down dead, whil&s;t you are
thus u&s;ing him; you mu&s;t make &s;atisfaction to the
owner.</P>
<P>The two ca&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed, becau&s;e in one ca&s;e, the
owner fore&s;ees the damage or ri&s;k, and therefore con&s;ents
to undertake it; in the other ca&s;e, he does not.</P>
<P>An e&s;tate or hou&s;e may, during the term of a lea&s;e, be
&s;o increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed in it's value, as to become worth
much more, or much le&s;s, than the rent agreed to be paid
for it. In some of which ca&s;es, it may be doubted, to
whom the advantage or di&s;advantage of natural right be|longs.
The rule of ju&s;tice &s;eems to be this: if the alte|ration
might be expected by the parties, the hirer mu&s;t
take the con&s;equence; if it could not, the owner. An
orchard, or a vineyard, or a mine, or a fi&s;hery, or a de|coy,
may this year yield nothing, or next to nothing,
yet the tenant &s;hall pay his rent; and if they next year
produce ten times the u&s;ual profit, no more &s;hall be de|manded;
becau&s;e the produce is in it's nature preca|rious,
and this variation might be expected. If an e&s;tate
in the fens of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> or the isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> be overflowed
with water, &s;o as to be incapable of occupation, the te|nant,
notwith&s;tanding, is bound by his lea&s;e; becau&s;e he
entered, into it with a knowledge and fore&s;ight of this
danger. On the other hand, if by the irruption of the
&s;ea into a country where it was never known to have
<PB N="132" REF="168">
come before, by the change of the cour&s;e of a river, the
fall of a rock, the breaking out of a volcano, the bur&s;ting
of a mo&s;s, the incur&s;ions of an enemy, or, by a mortal
contagion among&s;t the cattle; if by means like the&s;e, the
e&s;tate change, or lo&s;e it's value, the lo&s;s &s;hall fall upon
the owner; that is, the tenant &s;hall either be di&s;charged
from his agreement, or be entitled to an abatement of
rent. A hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> by the building of a bridge,
the opening of a new road or &s;treet, may become of ten
times it's former value; and by contrary cau&s;es, may be
as much reduced in value: here al&s;o, as before, the owner,
not the hirer, &s;hall be affected by the alteration. The
rea&s;on upon which our determination proceeds, is this,
that changes &s;uch as the&s;e, being neither fore&s;een, nor
provided for, by the contracting parties, form no part or
condition of the contract; and therefore ought to have
the &s;ame effect as if no contract at all had been made,
(for none was made with respect to <HI>them</HI>) that is, ought to
fall upon the owner.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts concerning the lending of Money.</HEAD>
<P>THERE exi&s;ts no rea&s;on, in the law of nature, why
a man &s;hould not be paid for the lending of his
money; as well as of any other property into which the
money might be converted.</P>
<P>The &s;cruples that have been entertained upon this head,
and upon the foundation of which, the receiving of inte|re&s;t
or u&s;ury (for they formerly meant the &s;ame thing) was
once prohibited in almo&s;t all Chri&s;tian countries,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By a &s;tatute of JAMES the Fir&s;t, intere&s;t above eight pounds per cent. was prohibited, (and con&s;equently under that rate allowed) with this &s;age provi&s;ion; <HI>That this &s;tatute &s;hall not be con&s;trued or expounded to allow the practice of u&s;ury in point of religion or con&s;cience.</HI></NOTE> aro&s;e
from a pa&s;&s;age in the law of MOSES, <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> xxiii, 19,
20, &startq;Thou &s;halt not lend upon u&s;ury to thy brother;
u&s;ury of money, u&s;ury of victuals, u&s;ury of any thing,
that is lent upon u&s;ury: unto a &s;tranger thou maye&s;t
lend upon u&s;ury; but unto thy brother thou &s;halt not
lend upon u&s;ury.&endq;</P>
<P>This, prohibition is now generally under&s;tood to have
been intended for the Jews alone, as part of the civil or
<PB N="134" REF="170">
political law of their nation; and calculated to pre&s;erve
that di&s;tribution of property, to which many of their
in&s;titutions were &s;ub&s;ervient; as the marriage of an heire&s;s
within, her own tribe; of a widow, who was left childle&s;s,
to her hu&s;band's brother; the year of jubilee, when alie|nated
e&s;tates reverted to the family of the original propri|etor;
regulations, which were never thought to be binding
upon any but the commonwealth of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>This interpretation is confirmed, I think, beyond all con|trover&s;y,
by the di&s;tinction made in the law, between a Jew
and a foreigner, &startq;unto a &s;tranger thou maye&s;t lend upon
u&s;ury, but unto thy brother, thou maye&s;t not lend upon
u&s;ury,&endq; a di&s;tinction, which could hardly have been ad|mitted,
into a law, which the divine author intended to
be of moral and of univer&s;al obligation.</P>
<P>The rate of intere&s;t is in mo&s;t countries regulated by
law. The Roman law allowed of twelve pounds per cent.
which <HI>Ju&s;tinian</HI> reduced at one &s;troke to four pounds. A
&s;tatute of the thirteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which
was the fir&s;t that tolerated the receiving of intere&s;t in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
re&s;trained it to ten pounds per cent; a &s;tatute of <HI>James</HI>
the Fir&s;t to eight pounds; of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to &s;ix
pounds.; of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> to five pounds, on pain of treble
value of the money lent; at which rate and penalty the
matter now &s;tands. The policy of the&s;e regulations is, to
check the power of accumulating wealth, without indu&s;try;
to give encouragement to trade, by enabling adventurers
<PB N="135" REF="171">
in it, to borrow money, at a moderate price; and of late
years, to enable the &s;tate to borrow the &s;ubject's money
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Compound intere&s;t, though forbidden by the law of
England, is agreeable, enough to natural equity; for inte|re&s;t,
detained after it is due, becomes, to all intents and
purpo&s;es, part of the &s;um lent.</P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion, which &s;ometimes occurs, how money bor|rowed
in one country, ought to be paid in another, where
the relative value of the precious metals is not the &s;ame.
For example, &s;uppo&s;e I borrow a hundred guineas in Lon|don,
where each guinea is worth one and twenty &s;hillings,
and meet my creditor in the Ea&s;t Indies, where a guinea is
worth no more perhaps than nineteen is it a &s;atisfaction of the
debt to return a hundred guineas? or mu&s;t I make up &s;o
many times one and twenty &s;hillings? I &s;hould think the
latter; for it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed, that my creditor, had he
not lent me his guineas, would have di&s;po&s;ed of them, in
&s;uch a manner, as to have now had, in the place of them,
&s;o many one and twenty &s;hillings; and the que&s;tion &s;up|po&s;es,
that he neither intended, nor ought to be a &s;ufferer,
by parting with his money to me.</P>
<P>When the relative value of coin is altered by an act of
the &s;tate; if the alteration would have extended to the iden|tical
pieces which were lent, it is enough to return an
equal number of pieces of the &s;ame denomination, or their
<PB N="136" REF="172">
pre&s;ent value in any other. As if guineas were reduced
by act of parliament to twenty &s;hillings, &s;o many twenty
&s;hillings, as I borrowed guineas, would be a ju&s;t repayment.
It would be otherwi&s;e, if the reduction was owing to a de|ba&s;ement
of the coin; for then re&s;pect ought to be had,
to the comparative value, of the old guinea, and the
new.</P>
<P>Whoever borrows money is bound in con&s;cience to re|pay
it. This every man can &s;ee; but every man cannot
&s;ee, or does not however reflect, that he is, in con&s;equence,
al&s;o bound, to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary to enable him&s;elf to
repay it. &startq;If he pay the money, when he has it, or has it
to &s;pare, he does all that an hone&s;t man can do,&endq; and all,
he imagines, that is required of him; whil&s;t the previous
mea&s;ures, which are nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h him with the mo|ney,
he makes no part of his care, nor ob&s;erves to be as
much his duty, as the other; &s;uch as &s;elling a family &s;eat,
or a family e&s;tate; contracting his plan of expence; lay|ing
down his equipage; reducing the number of his &s;er|vants;
or any of tho&s;e humiliating &s;acrifices, which ju&s;tice
requires of a man in debt, the moment he di&s;covers, that
he has no rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of paying his debts without
them a pro&s;pect, which depends upon the continuance of
his own life, will not &s;ati&s;fy an hone&s;t man, if a better
provi&s;ion be in his power; for it is a breach of faith to &s;ub|ject
a creditor, when we can help it, to the ri&s;k of our life,
be the event what it will; that not being the &s;ecurity to
credit was given.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="173">
I know few &s;ubjects which have been more mi&s;under|&s;tood
than the law which authori&s;es the impri&s;onment of
in&s;olvent debtors. It has been repre&s;ented as a gratuitous
cruelty, which contributes nothing to the reparation of the
creditor's lo&s;s, or to the advantage of the community. This
prejudice ari&s;es principally from con&s;idering the &s;ending of
a debtor to jail, as an act of private &s;ati&s;faction to the cre|ditor,
in&s;tead of a public puni&s;hment. As an act of &s;ati&s;|faction
or revenge, it is always wrong in the motive, and
often intemperate and undi&s;tingui&s;hing in the exerci&s;e.
Con&s;ider it as a public puni&s;hment, founded upon the &s;ame
rea&s;on, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame rules, as other puni&s;hments;
and the justice of it, together with the degree to which it
&s;hould be extended, and the objects upon whom it may be
inflicted, will be apparent. There are frauds relating to
in&s;olvency, again&s;t which it is as nece&s;&s;ary to provide pu|ni&s;hment,
as for any public crimes whatever; as where a
man gets your money into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and forthwith runs
away with it; or, what is little better, &s;quanders it in vi|tious
expences; or &s;takes it at the gaming table; in the al|ley;
or upon wild adventures in trade; or is con&s;cious at
the time he borrows it, that he can never repay it; or wil-fully
puts it out of his, power by profu&s;e living; or con|ceals
his effects, or transfers them by collu&s;ion to ano|ther;
not to mention the ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome debtors, who
had rather rot in a jail, than deliver up their estates; for,
to &s;ay the truth, the fir&s;t ab&s;urdity is in the law it&s;elf,
which leaves it in a debtor's power to withhold any part of
his property from the claim of his creditors. The only
<PB N="138" REF="174">
que&s;tion is, whether the puni&s;hment be properly placed in
the hands of an exa&s;perated creditor? for which it may be
&s;aid, that the&s;e frauds are &s;o &s;ubtle and ver&s;atile, that no|thing
but a di&s;cretionary
power can overtake them; and
that no di&s;cretion is likely to be &s;o well informed, &s;o vigi|lant,
and &s;o active, as that of the creditor.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, however, that the confinement
of a debtor in jail is a puni&s;hment; and that every puni&s;h|ment
&s;uppo&s;es a crime. To pur&s;ue therefore, with the ex|tremity
of legal rigour, a &s;ufferer, whom the fraud or
failure of others, his own want of capacity, or the di&s;ap|pointments
and mi&s;carriages to which all human affairs
are &s;ubject, have reduced to ruin, merely becau&s;e we are
provoked by our lo&s;s, and &s;eek to relieve the pain we feel,
by that which we inflict, is repugnant not only to hu|manity,
but to ju&s;tice; for it is to pervert a provi&s;ion of
law, de&s;igned for a different and a &s;alutary purpo&s;e, to the
gratification of private &s;pleen and re&s;entment. Any alte|ration
in the&s;e laws, which could di&s;tinguish the degrees of
guilt, or convert the &s;ervice of the in&s;olvent debtor &s;ome
public profit, might be an improvement; but any con&s;iderable
mitigation of their rigour, under colour of relieving, the
poor, would increa&s;e their hard&s;hips. For whatever de|prives
the creditor of his power of coercion, deprives him of
his &s;ecurity: and as this mu&s;t add greatly to the difficulty
of obtaining credit, the poor, e&s;pecially the lower &s;ort of
trade&s;men, are the fir&s;t who would, &s;uffer by &s;uch a regu|lation.
As trade&s;men mu&s;t buy <HI>before</HI> they &s;ell, you would
<PB N="139" REF="175">
exclude from trade two thirds of tho&s;e who now carry it
on, if none were enabled to enter into it, without a capital
&s;ufficient for prompt payments. An advocate, therefore,
for the intere&s;ts of this important cla&s;s of the community,
will deem it more eligible, that one out of a thou&s;and
&s;hould be &s;ent to jail by his creditor, than that the nine
hundred and ninety-nine &s;hould be &s;traitened, and embar|ra&s;&s;ed,
and many of them lie idle, by the want of credit.</P>

the kind and quantity of work to be required
of them, the intermi&s;&s;ion, liberty, and indulgence to be
allowed them, mu&s;t be determined in a great mea&s;ure by
cu&s;tom; for, where the contract involves &s;o many parti|culars,
the contracting parties expre&s;s a few perhaps of the
<PB N="140" REF="176">
principal, and by mutual under&s;tanding, refer the re&s;t to
the known cu&s;tom of the country in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands
of his ma&s;ter; to minister, for in&s;tance, to his unlawful
plea&s;ures; or to a&s;&s;ist him in unlawful practices in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion;
as in &s;muggling, or adulterating the articles which
he deals in, For the &s;ervant is bound by nothing but his
own promi&s;e; and the obligation of a promi&s;e extends not
to things unlawful.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the ma&s;ter's authority is no ju&s;tifi|cation
to the &s;ervant in doing wrong; for the &s;ervant's own
promi&s;e, upon which that authority is; founded, would be
none.</P>
<P>Clerks and apprentices ought to be employed entirely in
the profe&s;&s;ion or trade, which they are intended, to learn.
In&s;truction is their wages; and to deprive them of the op|portunities
of instruction, by taking up their time with oc|cupations
foreign to their bu&s;ine&s;s, is to defraud them of
their wages.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter is re&s;pon&s;ible for what a &s;ervant does in the
ordinary cour&s;e of his employment; for it is done under a
general authority committed to him, which is in ju&s;tice,
equivalent to a &s;pecific direction. Thus, if I pay money
to a banker's clerk, the banker is accountable; but not,
<PB N="141" REF="177">
if I had paid it to his butler or his footman, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s
it is not to receive money. Upon the &s;ame principle, if I
once &s;end a &s;ervant to take up goods upon credit, whatever
goods he afterwards takes up at the &s;ame &s;hop, &s;o long as
he continues in. my &s;ervice, are ju&s;tly chargeable to my
account.</P>
<P>The law of this country goes great lengths, in intending
a kind of concurrence in the ma&s;ter, &s;o as to charge him
with the con&s;equences of his &s;ervant's conduct. If an
inn-keeper's &s;ervant rob his gue&s;ts, the inn-keeper mu&s;t
make re&s;titution.; if a farrier's &s;ervant lame, your hor&s;e,
the farrier mu&s;t an&s;wer for the damage; and &s;till farther,
if your coachman or carter drive over a pa&s;&s;enger in the
road, the pa&s;&s;enger may recover from you a &s;ati&s;faction
for the hurt he &s;uffers. But the&s;e determinations &s;tand, I
think, rather upon the authority of the law,: than any
principle, of natural ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There is a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and facility in giving charac|ters,
as it is called, of &s;ervants, e&s;pecially when given
in writing, or according to &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed form, which,
to &s;peak, plainly of it, is a cheat upon tho&s;e who
accept them. They are given with &s;o little re&s;erve
and veracity, that I &s;hould as &s;oon depend, &s;ays the au|thor
of the Rambler, upon an acquittal, at the Old Bailey,
by way of recommendation, of a &s;ervant's hone&s;ty, as upon
one of the&s;e characters. It is &s;ometimes carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; and
&s;ometimes al&s;o to get rid of a bad &s;ervant, without the
<PB N="142" REF="178">
unea&s;ine&s;s of a di&s;pute; for which nothing can be pleaded,
but the mo&s;t ungenerous of all excu&s;es, that the per&s;on
we deceive is a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>There is a conduct, the rever&s;e of this, but more inju|rious,
becau&s;e the injury falls where there is no remedy.
I mean the ob&s;tructing of a &s;ervant's advancement, be|cau&s;e
you are unwilling to &s;pare his &s;ervice. To &s;tand in
the way of your &s;ervant's intere&s;t, is a poor return for his
fidelity; and affords flender encouragement for good be|haviour,
in this numerous, and therefore important, part
of the community. It is a piece of inju&s;tice, which, if
practiced towards an equal, the law of honor would lay
hold of; as it is, it is neither uncommon nor di&s;srepu|table.</P>
<P>A ma&s;ter of a family is culpable, if he permit any vices
among his dome&s;tics, which he might re&s;train by due
di&s;cipline, and a proper interpo&s;ition. This re&s;ults from
the general obligation to prevent mi&s;ery, when in our
power; and the a&s;&s;urance we have, that vice and mi&s;ery,
at the long run, go together. Care to maintain in his
family a &s;en&s;e of virtue and religion, received the di|vine
approbation in the per&s;on of ABRAHAM, <HI>Gen.</HI> xviii,
19, &startq;I know him, that he will command his children,
and <HI>his hou&s;ehold,</HI> after him; and they &s;hall keep the
way of the LORD, to do ju&s;tice and judgment.&endq; And

<P>WHOEVER undertakes another man's bu&s;ine&s;s, makes
it his own, that is, promi&s;es to employ upon
it the &s;ame care, attention, and diligence, that he would
do if it were actually his own; for he knows that the bu|&s;ine&s;s
was committed to him with that expectation. And
he promi&s;es no more than this; therefore an agent is not
obliged to wait, enquire, &s;olicit, ride about the country,
toil, or &s;tudy, whil&s;t there remains a po&s;&s;ibility of bene|fiting
his employer. If he exert &s;o much of his activity,
and u&s;e &s;uch caution, as the value of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in his
judgment, de&s;erves; that is, as he would have thought
&s;ufficient, if the &s;ame intere&s;t of his own had been at
&s;take, he has di&s;charged his duty, although it &s;hould af|terwards
turn out, that by more activity, and longer per|&s;everance,
he might have concluded the bu&s;iness with
greater advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="181">
This rule defines the duty of factors, &s;tewards, attor|nies,
advocates.</P>
<P>One of the chief difficulties of an agent's &s;ituation is,
to know how far he may depart from his in&s;tructions,
when he &s;ees rea&s;on to believe, from &s;ome change or di&s;|covery
in the circum&s;tances of his commi&s;&s;ion, that his
employer, if he were pre&s;ent, would alter his intention.
The latitude allowed to agents in this re&s;pect, will be dif|ferent,
according as the commi&s;&s;ion was confidential or
mini&s;terial; and according as the general rule and nature
of the &s;ervice require a prompt and preci&s;e obedience to
orders or not. An attorney &s;ent to treat for an e&s;tate, if he
found out a flaw in the title, would defi&s;t from propo&s;ing the
price he was directed to propo&s;e; and very properly. On
the other hand, if the commander in chief of an army
detach an officer under him upon a particular &s;ervice,
which &s;ervice turns out more difficult, or le&s;s expedient, than was &s;uppo&s;ed; in &s;o much that the officer is con|vinced
that his commander, if he were acquainted with
the true &s;tate in which the affair is found, would recall
his orders; yet, if he cannot wait for fre&s;h directions,
without prejudice to the expedition he is &s;ent upon, he
mu&s;t at all hazards pur&s;ue tho&s;e which he brought out
with him.</P>
<P>What is tru&s;ted to an agent, may be lo&s;t or damaged in
his hands by misfortune. An agent who acts without pay,
is clearly not an&s;werable for the lo&s;s; for, if he give

<PB N="146" REF="184">
labour for nothing, it cannot be pre&s;umed, that he gave
al&s;o &s;ecurity for the &s;ucce&s;s of it. If the agent be hired
to the bu&s;ine&s;s, the que&s;tion will depend upon the appre|hen&s;ion
of the parties at the time of making the contract;
which apprehen&s;ion of theirs mu&s;t be collected chiefly from
cu&s;tom, by which probably it was guided. Whether a
public carrier ought to account for goods &s;ent by him&mdash;the
owner or ma&s;ter of a &s;hip for the cargo&mdash;the po&s;t-office for
letters, or bills inclo&s;ed in letters, where the lo&s;s is not
imputed to any fault or neglect of theirs; are que&s;tions of
this &s;ort. Any expre&s;&s;ion, which, by implication, amounts
to a promi&s;e, will be binding upon the agent, without
cu&s;tom; as where the proprietors of a &s;tage-coach adver|ti&s;e,
that they will not be accountable for money, plate,
or jewels; this makes them accountable for every thing
el&s;e: or, where the price is too much for the labour, part
of it may be con&s;idered as a premium for in&s;urance. On
the other hand, any caution on the part of the owner, to
guard again&s;t danger, is evidence, that he con&s;iders the
ri&s;k to be his; as cutting a bank bill in two, to &s;end by
the po&s;t at different times.</P>
<P>Univer&s;ally, unle&s;s <HI>a promi&s;e,</HI> either expre&s;e or tacit, can
be proved again&s;t the agent, the lo&s;s mu&s;t fall upon the
owner.</P>
<P>The agent may be a &s;ufferer in his own per&s;on or pro|perty,
by the bu&s;ine&s;s he undertakes; as where one goes
a journey for another, and hurts him&s;elf, or lames his hor&s;e,
<PB N="147" REF="185">
by a fall upon the road; but, unle&s;s the &s;ame be provided
for by expre&s;s &s;tipulation, the agent is not entitled to any
compen&s;ation from his employer on that account; for
where the danger is not fore&s;een, there can be no rea&s;on
to believe, that the employer engaged to indemnify the
agent again&s;t it; much le&s;s, where it is fore&s;een; for
whoever knowingly undertakes a dangerous employment,
in common con&s;truction, takes upon him&s;elf the danger
and the con&s;equences; as where a fireman undertakes for
a reward, to re&s;cue a box of writings from the flames;
or a &s;ailor to bring off a pa&s;&s;enger from a &s;hip in a &s;torm.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of Labour.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Partner&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>I Know of nothing upon this &s;ubject, that requires ex|planation,
but how the profits are to be divided,
where one partner contributes money, and the other la|bour;
which is a common ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Rule.</HI> From the &s;tock of the partner&s;hip deduct the &s;um
advanced, and divide the remainder between the monied
partner and the labouring partner, in the proportion of
<PB N="148" REF="186">
the intere&s;t of the money, to the wages of the labour;
allowing &s;uch a rate of intere&s;t, as money might be bor|rowed
for, upon the &s;ame &s;ecurity, and &s;uch wages as a
journeyman would require for the &s;ame labour and tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> A advances a thou&s;and pounds, but knows no|thing
of the bu&s;ine&s;s; B produces no money, but has been
brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s and undertakes to conduct it.
At the end of the year, the &s;tock and effects of the partner|&s;hip
amount to twelve hundred pounds; con&s;equently there
are two hundred pounds to divide. Now no body would
lend money upon the event of the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ucceeding,
which is A's &s;ecurity, under &s;ix per cent.&mdash;therefore A mu&s;t
be allowed &s;ixty pounds for the intere&s;t of his money: B,
before he engaged in the partner&s;hip, earned thirty pounds
a year in the &s;ame employment; his labour, therefore,
ought to be valued at thirty pounds: and the two hundred
pounds mu&s;t be divided between the partners, in the pro|portion
of &s;ixty to thirty, that is, A mu&s;t receive one hun|dred
and thirty-three pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence,
and B &s;ixty-&s;ix pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four pence.</P>
<P>If there be nothing gained, A lo&s;es his intere&s;t, and B
his labour, which is right. If the original &s;tock be dimi|ni&s;hed,
by this rule B lo&s;es only his labour, as before;
whereas A lo&s;es his intere&s;t, and part of the principal: for
which eventual di&s;advantage, A is compen&s;ated, by having
the intere&s;t of his money computed at &s;ix per cent, in the
divi&s;ion of the profit, when there is any.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="187">
It is true, that the divi&s;ion of the profit is &s;eldom forgot|ten
in the con&s;titution of the partner&s;hip; and is therefore
commonly &s;ettled by expre&s;s agreement: but the&s;e agree|ments,
to be equitable, &s;hould pur&s;ue the principle of the
rule here laid down.</P>
<P>All the partners are bound, by what any one of them
does in the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s; for, <HI>quoad hoc,</HI> each
partner is con&s;idered as an authori&s;ed agent for the re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Offices.</HEAD>
<P>IN many offices, as &s;chools, fellow&s;hips of colleges, pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hips
in the univer&s;ities, and the like, there is a two|fold
contract, one with the founder, the other with the
electors.</P>
<P>The contract with the founder obliges the incumbent of
the office, to di&s;charge every duty appointed by the charter,
&s;tatutes, deed of gift, or will of the founder; becau&s;e the
endowment was given, and con&s;equently accepted for that
purpo&s;e, and upon the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="188">
The contract with the electors extends this obligation, to
all duties, that have been cu&s;tomarily connected with, and
reckoned a part of the office, though not pre&s;cribed by the
founder; for the electors expect from the per&s;on they
choo&s;e, all the duties which his predce&s;&s;ors have di&s;|charged;
and, as the per&s;on elected cannot be ignorant of
their expectation, if he means to refu&s;e this condition, he
ought to appri&s;e them of his objection.</P>
<P>And here let it be ob&s;erved, that the leave of the elec|tors
is, in con&s;cience, an excu&s;e from this la&s;t cla&s;s of du|ties
only; becau&s;e they re&s;ult from a contract, to which the
electors, and the per&s;on-elected, are the only parties. The
other cla&s;s of duties re&s;ult from a different contract.</P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion of &s;ome magnitude and difficulty, what
offices may be con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;upplied by deputy.</P>
<P>We will &s;tate the &s;everal objections to the &s;ub&s;titution of
a deputy; and then it will be under&s;tood that a deputy
may be allowed in all ca&s;es, to which the&s;e objections do
not apply.</P>
<P>An office may <HI>not</HI> be di&s;charged by deputy,</P>
<P>1. Where a particular confidence is repo&s;ed, in the per|&s;on
appointed to it; as the office of a &s;teward, guardian,
judge, commander in chief, by land or &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="189">
2. Where the cu&s;tom hinders; as in the ca&s;e of &s;chool|ma&s;ters,
tutors, and of commi&s;&s;ions in the army and navy.</P>
<P>3. Where the duty cannot, from it's nature, be &s;o well
performed by a deputy; as the deputy governor of a pro|vince
may not po&s;&s;e&s;s the legal authority, or the actual
influence, of his principal.</P>
<P>4. When &s;ome inconveniency would re&s;ult, to the &s;er|vice
in general, from the permi&s;&s;ion of deputies in &s;uch
ca&s;es: for example, it is probable, that military merit would
be much di&s;couraged, if the duties belonging to commi&s;|&s;ions
in the army, were generally allowed to be executed
by &s;ub&s;titutes.</P>
<P>The non-re&s;idence of the parochial clergy, who &s;upply
the duty of their benefices by curates, is worthy of a more
di&s;tinct con&s;ideration. And, in order to draw the que&s;tion
upon this ca&s;e, to a point, we will &s;uppo&s;e the officiating
curate, to di&s;charge every duty, which his principal, were
he pre&s;ent, would be bound to di&s;charge, and in a manner
equally beneficial to the pari&s;h; under which circum|&s;tances,
the only objection to the ab&s;ence of the principal,
at lea&s;t, the only one of the foregoing objections is the
la&s;t.</P>
<P>And, in my judgment, the force of this objection will
be much dimini&s;hed, if the ab&s;ent rector or vicar be, in the
<PB N="152" REF="190">
meantime, engaged in any function or employment, of
equal importance to the general intere&s;t of religion, or of
greater. For the whole revenue of the national church
may properly enough be con&s;idered as a common fund, for
the &s;upport of the national religion; and, if a clergyman
be &s;erving the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity and prote&s;tanti&s;m, it can
make little difference, out of what particular portion of this
fund, that is, by the tythes and glebe of what particular
pari&s;h his &s;ervice be requited; any more than it can pre|judice
the king's &s;ervice, that an officer who has &s;ignalized
his merit in America, &s;hould be rewarded with the govern|ment
of a fort or ca&s;tle in Ireland, which he never &s;aw;
but for the cu&s;tody of which proper provi&s;ion is made, and care taken.</P>
<P>Upon the principle thus explained, this indulgence is
due to none more than to tho&s;e who are occupied in culti|vating,
or communicating religious knowledge, or the &s;ci|ences
&s;ub&s;idiary to religion.</P>
<P>This way of con&s;idering the revenues of the church,
as a common fund for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, is the more equi|table,
as the value of particular preferments bears no pro|portion
to the particular charge or labour.</P>
<P>But when a man draws upon this fund, who&s;e &s;tudies
and employments bear no relation to the object of it; and
who is no farther a mini&s;ter of the chri&s;tian religion, than
<PB N="153" REF="191">
as a cockade makes a &s;oldier, it &s;eems a mi&s;application, lit|tle
better than robbery.</P>
<P>And to tho&s;e who have the management of &s;uch matters,
I &s;ubmit this que&s;tion, whether the impoveri&s;hing of the
fund, by converting the be&s;t &s;hare of it into <HI>annuities</HI> for the
gay and illiterate youth of great families, threatens not to
&s;tarve and &s;tifle the little clerical merit that is left among&s;t
us?</P>
<P>All legal di&s;pen&s;ations from re&s;idence, proceed upon the
&s;uppo&s;ition, that the ab&s;entee is detained from his living,
by &s;ome engagement of equal or of greater public impor|tance.
Therefore, if in a ca&s;e, where no &s;uch rea&s;on can
with truth be pleaded, it be &s;aid, that this que&s;tion regards
a right of property; and that all right of property awaits
the di&s;po&s;ition of law; that if therefore, the law, which
gives a man the emoluments of a living, excu&s;e him from re&s;iding upon it, he is excu&s;ed in con&s;cience; we an&s;wer,
that the law does not excu&s;e him by <HI>intention,</HI> and that all
other excu&s;es are fraudulent.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lies.</HEAD>
<P>ALIE is a breach of promi&s;e; for whoever &s;eriou&s;ly
addre&s;&s;es his di&s;cour&s;e to another, tacitly promi&s;es to
&s;peak the truth, becau&s;e he knows that the truth is ex|pected.</P>
<P>Or the obligation of veracity may be made out, from the
direct ill con&s;equences of lying to &s;ocial happine&s;s. Which
con&s;equences con&s;i&s;t, either in &s;ome &s;pecific injury to parti|cular
individuals, or in the de&s;truction of that confidence,
which is e&s;&s;ential to the intercour&s;e of human life: for
which latter rea&s;on, a lie may be pernicious in it's general
tendency, and therefore criminal, though it produce no
particular or vi&s;ible mi&s;chief to any one.</P>
<P>There are fal&s;hoods which are not lies; that is, which
are not criminal, as,</P>
<P>1. Where no one is deceived; which is the ca&s;e in pa|rables,
fables, novels, je&s;ts, tales to create mirth, ludicrous
embelli&s;hments of a &s;tory, where the declared de&s;ign of the
&s;peaker is not to inform, but to divert, compliments in the
<PB N="155" REF="193">
&s;ub&s;cription of a letter, a &s;ervant's <HI>denying</HI> his ma&s;ter, a
pri&s;oner's pleading not guilty, an advocate a&s;&s;erting the
ju&s;tice, or his belief of the ju&s;tice of his client's cau&s;e. In
&s;uch in&s;tances, no confidence is de&s;troyed, becau&s;e none was
repo&s;ed; no promi&s;e to &s;peak the truth is violated, becau&s;e
none was given, or under&s;tood to be given.</P>
<P>2. Where the per&s;on you &s;peak to has no right to know
the truth, or more properly, where little or no inconvenience
re&s;ults from the want of confidence; in &s;uch ca&s;es, as
where you tell a fal&s;hood to a child, or a madman, for their
own advantage; to a robber, to conceal your property; to
an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, to defeat, or to divert him from his purpo&s;e.
The particular con&s;equence is by the &s;uppo&s;ition beneficial;
and, as to the general con&s;equence, the wor&s;t that can hap|pen
is, that the child, the madman, the robber, the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in,
will tru&s;t you no more; which (be&s;ides, that the two
fir&s;t are incapable of deducing regular conclusions, from
having been once deceived, and the two la&s;t not likely to
come a &s;econd time in your way) is &s;ufficiently compen|&s;ated,
by the immediate, benefit which you propo&s;e by the
fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle, that, by the laws of war, it is
allowed, to deceive an enemy by feints, fal&s;e colours, &s;pies,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There have been two or three in&s;tances of late, of Engli&s;h &s;hips decoying the enemy into their power, by counterfeiting &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; an artifice, which ought to be reprobated by the common indignation of mankind: for for a few examples, of captures effected by this &s;tratagem, would put an end to that promptitude, in affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;hips in di&s;tre&s;s, which is the be&s;t virtue in a &s;eafaring character, and by which the perils of navigation are dimini&s;hed to all.</NOTE>

fal&s;e intelligence, and the like; but, by no means, in trea|ties,
truces, &s;ignals of capitulation, or &s;urrender: and the
difference is, that the former &s;uppo&s;e ho&s;tilities to conti|nue,
the latter are calculated to terminate or &s;u&s;pend them.
In the conduct of war, and whil&s;t the war continues, there
is no u&s;e, or rather no place for confidence, betwixt the
contending parties; but in whatever relates to the termi|nation
of war, the mo&s;t religious &s;idelity is expected, be|cau&s;e
without it wars could not cea&s;e, nor the victors be
&s;ecure, but by the entire di&s;truction of the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Many people indulge in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e a habit of
fiction and exaggeration, in the accounts they give of
them&s;elves, of their acquaintance, or of the extraordinary
things which they have &s;een or heard; and &s;o long as the
facts they relate are indifferent, and their narratives, tho' fal&s;e, are inoffen&s;ive, it may &s;eem a &s;uper&s;titious regard to
truth, to cen&s;ure them merely for truth's &s;ake.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pronounce be|forehand,
with certainty, concerning any lie, that it is in|offen&s;ive. <HI>Volat irrevocable;</HI> and collects oft-times accretions
in it's flight, which entirely change it's nature. It may
owe po&s;&s;ibly it's mi&s;chief to the officiou&s;ne&s;s or mi&s;repre|&s;entation
of tho&s;e who circulate it; but the mi&s;chief is
<PB N="157" REF="195">
neverthele&s;s, in &s;ome degree, chargeable upon the origin|nal
editor.</P>
<P>In the next place, this liberty in conver&s;ation defeats it's
own end. Much of the plea&s;ure, and all the benefit of
conver&s;ation, depends upon our opinion of the &s;peaker's
veracity; for which this rule leaves no foundation. The
faith indeed of a hearer mu&s;t be extremely perplexed,
who con&s;iders the &s;peaker, or believes that the &s;peaker con|&s;iders
him&s;elf as under no obligation to adhere to truth,
but according to the particular importance of what he re|lates.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides and above both the&s;e rea&s;ons, <HI>white</HI> lies al|ways
introduce others of a darker complexion. I have
&s;eldom known any one who de&s;erted truth in trifles, that
could be tru&s;ted in matters of importance. Nice di&s;tinc|tions
are out of the que&s;tion, upon occa&s;ions, which, like
tho&s;e of &s;peech, return every hour. The habit therefore,
when once formed, is ea&s;ily extended to &s;erve the de&s;igns
of malice or intere&s;t, and like all habits, it &s;preads indeed
of it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Pious</HI> frauds, as they are improperly enough called, pre|tended
in&s;pirations, forged books, counterfeit miracles,
are impo&s;itions of a more &s;erious nature. It is po&s;&s;ible,
they may &s;ometimes, though &s;eldom, have been &s;et up and
encouraged, with a de&s;ign to do good; but the good they
aim at, requires that the belief of them &s;hould be perpe|tual;
<PB N="158" REF="196">
which is hardly po&s;&s;ible; and the detection of
the fraud, is &s;ure to di&s;parage the credit of all preten&s;ions
of the &s;ame nature. Chri&s;tianity has &s;uffered more injury
from this cau&s;e, than from all other cau&s;es put toge|ther.</P>
<P>As there may be fal&s;ehoods, which are not lies, &s;o there
may be lies, without literal or direct fal&s;ehood; as when
the literal and grammatical &s;ignification of a &s;entence is
different from the popular and cu&s;tomary &s;en&s;e of it. It is
the wilful deceit that makes the lie; and we wilfully de|ceive,
when our expre&s;&s;ions are not true, in the &s;en&s;e in
which we believe the hearer apprehends them. Be&s;ides, it

</LIST>
<P>I. The forms of oaths, like other religious ceremonies,
have been always very various; but con&s;i&s;ting for the mo&s;t
part, of &s;ome bodily action (from which they are called
corporal oaths) and of a pre&s;cribed form of words. Among&s;t
the <HI>Jews;</HI> the juror held up his right-hand towards hea|ven,
which explains a pa&s;&s;age in the cxlivth P&s;alm, &startq;who&s;e
mouth &s;peaketh vanity, and <HI>their right-hand is a right-hand
of fal&s;ehood.&endq;</HI> The &s;ame form is retained in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
&s;till. An oath of fidelity was taken, by the &s;ervant's
putting his hand under the thigh of his lord, as <HI>Eliezer</HI> did
<PB N="160" REF="198">
to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> xxiv. 2. from whence, with no great va|riation,
is derived perhaps the form of doing homage at
this day, by putting the hands between the knees, and
within the hands of the liege.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> the form differed with
the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion of the oath. In private contracts,
the parties took hold of each other's hand, whil&s;t they
&s;wore to the performance; or they touched the altar of the
God, by who&s;e divinity they &s;wore. Upon more &s;olemn
occa&s;ions, it was the cu&s;tom to &s;lay a victim; and the
bea&s;t being <HI>&s;truck down,</HI> with certain ceremonies and in|vocations,
gave birth to the expre&s;&s;ions <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;e|rire
pactum, and to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phra&s;e, tran&s;lated from the&s;e,
of &startq;&s;triking a bargain.&endq;</P>
<P>The forms of oaths in Chri&s;tian countries, are al&s;o very
different; but in none, I believe, wor&s;e contrived, either
to expre&s;s or impre&s;s the meaning and obligation of an
oath, than in our own. The juror, with us, after repeat|ing
the promi&s;e or affirmation, which the oath is intended
to confirm, adds, &startq;&s;o help me God:&endq; or, more fre|quently
the &s;ub&s;tance of the oath is repeated to the juror,
by the officer or magi&s;trate who admini&s;ters it; adding in
the conclu&s;ion, &startq;&s;o help you God.&endq; The energy of the
&s;entence re&s;ides in the particle <HI>&s;o; &s;o,</HI> that is, <HI>h&acirc;c lege,</HI>
upon condition of my &s;peaking the truth, or performing
this promi&s;e, may God help me, and not otherwi&s;e. The
juror, whil&s;t he hears or repeats the words of the oath,
<PB N="161" REF="199">
holds his right-hand upon a bible, or other book, contain|ing
the four go&s;pels. The conclusion of the oath &s;ome|times
runs, &startq;ita me Deus adjuvet et haec &s;ancta evange|lia,&endq;
or &startq;&s;o help me God, and the contents of this
book;&endq; which la&s;t clau&s;e forms a connection between the
words and action of the juror, which, before was wanting.
The juror then ki&s;&s;es the book; the ki&s;s however &s;eems
rather an act of reverence to the contents of the book, as,
in the popi&s;h ritual, the prie&s;t ki&s;&s;es the go&s;pel before he
reads it, than any part of the oath.</P>
<P>This ob&s;cure and elliptical form, together with the le|vity
and frequency with which it is admini&s;tered, has
brought about a general inadvertency to the obligation of
oaths, which, both in a religious and political view, is
much to be lamented; and it merits public con&s;ideration,
whether the requiring of oaths on &s;o many frivolous oc|ca&s;ions,
e&s;pecially in the cu&s;toms, and in the qualification
for petty offices, has any other effect, than to make them
cheap in the minds of the people. A pound of tea cannot
travel regularly from the &s;hip to the con&s;umer, without
co&s;ting half a dozen oaths at the lea&s;t; and the &s;ame &s;ecu|rity
for the due di&s;charge of their office, namely that of
an oath, is required from a churchwarden and an arch|bi&s;hop,
from a petty con&s;table and the chief ju&s;tice of
<HI>England.</HI> Let the law continue it's own &s;anctions, if they
be thought nece&s;&s;ary; but let it &s;pare the &s;olemnity of an
oath. And where it is nece&s;&s;ary to accept men's own word
or account, for want of any thing better to depend upon,
<PB N="162" REF="200">
let it annex to prevarication penalties proportioned to the
public con&s;equence of the offence.</P>
<P>II. But whatever be the form of an oath, the <HI>fignification</HI> is
the &s;ame. It is &startq;the calling upon God to witne&s;s, <HI>i. e.</HI>
to take notice of what we &s;ay, and invoking his vengeance,
or renouncing his favor, if what we &s;ay be fal&s;e, or what
we promi&s;e be not performed.&endq;</P>
<P>III. Quakers and Moravians refu&s;e to &s;wear upon any oc|ca&s;ion;
founding their &s;cruples concerning the <HI>lawfulne&s;s</HI>
of oaths, upon our Saviour's prohibition, <HI>Matth.</HI> v. 34.
&startq;I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all.&endq;</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which we give to this objection, cannot be
under&s;tood, without fir&s;t &s;tating the whole pa&s;&s;age; &startq;Ye
have heard, that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time,
thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf, but &s;halt perform unto
the Lord thine oaths; but I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not
at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor
by the earth, for it is his foot&s;tool; neither by <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI>
for it is the city of the great King; neither &s;halt
thou &s;wear by thy head, becau&s;e thou can'&s;t not make
one hair white or black: but let your communication
be yea yea, nay nay, for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e
cometh of evil.&endq;</P>
<P>To reconcile with this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, the prac|tice
of &s;wearing, or taking oaths, when required by law,
the following ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be attended to.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="201">
1. It does not appear, that &s;wearing &startq;by heaven,&endq; &startq;by the earth,&endq; &startq;by <HI>Jeru&s;alem,&endq;</HI> or &startq;by their own head,&endq; was
a form of &s;wearing ever made u&s;e of among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> in
judicial oaths: and con&s;equently it is not probable that
they were judicial oaths, which Chri&s;t had in his mind
when he mentioned tho&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>2. As to the &s;eeming univer&s;ality of the prohibition,
&startq;&s;wear not at all,&endq; the emphatic clau&s;e &startq;not at all,&endq; is
to be read in connection with what follows; &startq;not at all&endq;
<HI>&startq;h. e.</HI> neither by the heaven,&endq; nor &startq;by the earth,&endq; nor
by &startq;<HI>Jeru&s;alem,&endq;</HI> nor by thy &startq;head:&endq; &startq;not at all&endq; does
not mean upon no occa&s;ion, but by none of the&s;e forms.</P>
<P>3. Our Saviour's argument &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, that the
people, to whom he &s;pake, made a di&s;tinction between
&s;wearing directly by the &startq;name of God,&endq; and &s;wearing by
tho&s;e inferior objects of veneration, &startq;the heavens,&endq; &startq;the earth,&endq; &startq;<HI>Jeru&s;elam,&endq;</HI> &startq;or their own head.&endq; In op|po&s;&s;tion
to which di&s;tinction, he tells them, that, on ac|count
of the relation which the&s;e things bore to the &s;u|preme
being, to &s;wear by any of them, was in effect and
&s;ub&s;tance to &s;wear by <HI>him;</HI> &startq;by heaven, for it is his
throne; by the earth, for it is his foot&s;tool; by <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
for it is the city of the great King; by thy head,&endq;
for it is <HI>his</HI> workman&s;hip, not thine, &startq;thou can'&s;t not
make one hair white or black:&endq; for which rea&s;on, he &s;ays,
&startq;&s;wear not at all,&endq; that is, neither directly by God, nor
indirectly by any thing related to him. This interpreta|tion
<PB N="164" REF="202">
is greatly confirmed, by a pa&s;&s;age in the twenty-third
chapter of the &s;ame go&s;pel, where a &s;imilar distinction,
made by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, is replied to in the &s;ame
manner.</P>
<P>4. Our Saviour him&s;elf being &startq;adjured by the living
God,&endq; to declare whether he was the Chri&s;t, the &s;on of
God, or not, conde&s;cended to an&s;wer the high prie&s;t, without
making any objection to the oath, (for &s;uch it was) upon
which he examined him. <HI>&startq;God is my witne&s;s,&endq;</HI> &s;ays St.
<HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> &startq;that without cea&s;ing, I make men|tion
of you in my prayers:&endq; and to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> &s;till
more &s;trongly, &startq;<HI>I call God for a record upon my &s;oul,</HI> that,
to &s;pare you, I came not as yet to <HI>Corinth.</HI>&endq; Both the&s;e
expre&s;&s;ions contain the nature of oaths. The epi&s;tle to the
<HI>Hebrews</HI> &s;peaks of the cu&s;tom of &s;wearing judicially, with|out
any mark of cen&s;ure or di&s;approbation, "men verily
&s;wear by the greater, and an oath, for confirmation, is,
to them, an end of all &s;trife.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;trength of the&s;e rea&s;ons, we explain our Sa|viour's
words to relate, not to judicial oaths, but to the
practice of vain, wanton, and unauthor&igrave;&s;ed &s;wearing, in
common di&s;cour&s;e. St. <HI>James's</HI> words, chap. v. 12, are
not &s;o &s;trong as our Saviour's, and therefore admit the &s;ame
explanation with more ea&s;e.</P>
<P>VI. Oaths are nugatory, that is, carry with them no
<HI>proper</HI> force or <HI>obligation,</HI> unle&s;s we believe, that God will
<PB N="165" REF="203">
puni&s;h fal&s;e &s;wearing, with, more &s;everity than a &s;imple
lie, or breach of promi&s;e; for which belief there are the
following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>1. Perjury is a &s;in of greater deliberation. The Juror
has, I believe, in fact, the thoughts of God, and of reli|gion,
upon his mind, at the time; at lea&s;t there are very
few who can &s;hake them off entirely. He offends therefore,
if he do offend, with a high hand, in the face, that
is, and in defiance of the &s;anctions of religion. His offence
implies a di&s;belief, or contempt of God's knowledge, power,
and ju&s;tice, which cannot be &s;aid of a lie, where there is
nothing to carry the mind to any reflection upon the Deity,
or the divine attributes at all.</P>
<P>2. Perjury violates a &s;uperior confidence. Mankind mu&s;t
tru&s;t to one another; and they have nothing better to tru&s;t
to than one another's oath. Hence legal adjudications,
which govern and affect every right and intere&s;t on this
&s;ide the grave, of nece&s;&s;ity proceed, and depend upon oaths.
Perjury, therefore, in it's general con&s;equence, &s;trikes at the
&s;ecurity of reputation, property, and even of life it&s;elf. A
lie cannot do the &s;ame mi&s;chief, becau&s;e the &s;ame credit is
not given to it.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Except indeed, where a Quakers or Moravian's affirmation is accepted in the place of an oath; in which ca&s;e, a lie partakes, &s;o far as this rea&s;on ex|tends, of the nature and guilt of perjury.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="204">
3. God directed the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to &s;wear by his name;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 13. x. 20.</NOTE>
and was plea&s;ed, &startq;in order to &s;how the immutability of
his own council,&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 17.</NOTE> to confirm his covenant, with that
people, by an oath. Neither of which it is probable he
would have done, had he not intended to repre&s;ent oaths,
as having &s;ome meaning and effect, beyond the obligation
of a bare, promi&s;e; which effect mu&s;t be owing to the &s;e|verer
puni&s;hment, with which he will vindicate the autho|rity
of oaths.</P>
<P>V. Promi&s;&s;ory oaths are <HI>not binding,</HI> where the promi&s;e
it&s;elf would not be &s;o: for the &s;everal ca&s;es of which, &s;ee
the chapter of promi&s;es.</P>
<P>VI. As oaths are de&s;igned for the &s;ecuriiy of the impo&s;er,
it is manife&s;t they mu&s;t be performed, and <HI>interpreted,</HI> in the
&s;en&s;e in which the impo&s;er intends them; otherwi&s;e, they
afford no &s;ecurity to <HI>him.</HI> And this is the meaning and
rea&s;on of the rule, &startq;jurare in animum imponentis;&endq; which rule,
the reader is de&s;ired to carry along with him, whil&s;t we
proceed to con&s;ider certain particular oaths, which are,
either of greater importance, or more likely to fall in our
way than others.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oath in Evidence.</HEAD>
<P>THE witne&s;s &s;wears, &startq;to &s;peak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, touching the
matter in que&s;tion.&endq;</P>
<P>Upon which it may be ob&s;erved, that the de&s;igned con|cealment
of any truth, which relates to the matter in agi|tation,
is as much a violation of the oath, as to te&s;tify a po|&s;itive
fal&s;ehood; and this, whether he be interrogated to
that particular point or not. For when a witne&s;s is &s;worn
upon a voir dire, that is, in order to enquire, whether he
ought to be admitted to give evidence in the cau&s;e at all, the
form runs thus, "you &s;hall true an&s;wer make to all &s;uch
&startq;que&s;tions as shall be a&s;ked you;&endq; but, when he comes to
be &s;worn in chief, he &s;wears, &startq;to &s;peak the whole truth,&endq;
without re&s;training it, as before, to the que&s;tions that
&s;hall be a&s;ked: which difference &s;hews, that the law intends, in
this latter ca&s;e, to require of the witne&s;s, that he give a
complete, and unre&s;erved account of what he knows of the
&s;ubject of the trial, whether the que&s;tions propo&s;ed to him,
reach the extent of his knowledge or not. So that if it be
enquired of the witne&s;s afterwards, why he did not inform
the court &s;o and &s;o, it is no &s;ufficient, though a very com|mon
an&s;wer to &s;ay, becau&s;e it was never a&s;ked me.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="206">
I know of but one exception to this rule; which is,
when a full di&s;covery of the truth tends to accu&s;e the wit|ne&s;s
him&s;elf of &s;ome legal crime. The law of <HI>England</HI>
con&s;trains no man to accu&s;e him&s;elf; con&s;equently impo&s;es
the oath of te&s;timony with this tacit re&s;ervation. But the
exception mu&s;t be confined to <HI>legal</HI> crimes. A point of
honour, of delicacy, or of reputation, may make a wit|ne&s;s
backward to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome circum&s;tance, which he is
acquainted with; but is no excu&s;e for concealment, unle&s;s
it could be &s;hewn, that the law which impo&s;es the oath,
intended to allow this indulgence to &s;uch motives. The
exception is al&s;o withdrawn by compact between the ma|gi&s;trate
and the witne&s;s, when an accomplice is admitted
to give evidence again&s;t the partners of his crime.</P>
<P>Tenderne&s;s to the pri&s;oner, is a &s;pecious apology for
concealment, but no ju&s;t excu&s;e; for if this plea be
thought &s;ufficient, it takes the admini&s;tration of penal
ju&s;tice out of the hands of judges and juries, and makes
it depend upon the temper of pro&s;ecutors and witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Que&s;tions may be a&s;ked which are irrelative to the cau&s;e,
which affect the witne&s;s him&s;elf, or &s;ome third per&s;on;
in which, and in all ca&s;es, where the witne&s;s doubts of the perti|nency
and propriety of the que&s;tion, he ought to refer
his doubts to the court. The an&s;wer of the court, in re|laxation
of the oath, is authority enough to the witne&s;s;
for the law which impo&s;es the oath, may remit what it
will of the obligation; and it belongs to the court to de|clare
<PB N="169" REF="207">
clare what the mind of the law is. Neverthele&s;s it cannot
be &s;aid univer&s;ally, that the an&s;wer of the court is con|clu&s;ive
upon the con&s;cience of the witne&s;s; for his obliga|tion
depends upon what he apprehended, at the time of
taking the oath, to be the de&s;ign of the law in im|po&s;ing
it; and no after requi&s;ition or explanation by the
court, can carry the obligation beyond that.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oath of Allegiance.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;I DO &s;incerely promi&s;e, and &s;wear, that I will be
faithful and bear true allegiance to his Maje&s;ty
King GEORGE.&endq; Formerly the oath of allegiance ran
thus: &startq;I do promi&s;e to be true and faithful to the King
and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear, of life, and
limb, and terrene honour; and not to know or hear of
any ill or damage intended him, without defending him
therefrom:&endq; and was altered at the Revolution to the
pre&s;ent form. So that the pre&s;ent oath is a relaxation of
the old one. And as the oath was intended to a&s;certain,
not &s;o much the extent of the &s;ubject's obedience, as to
whom it was due, the legi&s;lature &s;eems to have wrapped up
it's meaning upon the former point, in a word purpo&s;ely
made choice of for it's general and indeterminate
&s;ignifica|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="208">
It will be mo&s;t convenient to con&s;ider, fir&s;t, what the
cath excludes, as incon&s;i&s;tent with it; &s;econdly, what it
permits.</P>
<P>1. The oath excludes all intention to &s;upport the claim
or preten&s;ions of any other per&s;on or per&s;ons, than the
reigning &s;overeign, to the crown and government. A <HI>Ja|cobite,</HI>
who is per&s;uaded of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s right to the
crown, and moreover de&s;igns to join with the adherents
of that cau&s;e, to a&s;&s;ert this right, whenever a proper
opportunity, with a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, pre|&s;ents
it&s;elf, cannot take the oath of allegiance; or,
if he could, the path of abjuration follows, which
contains an expre&s;s renunciation of all opinions in favour
of the claim of the exiled family. An inhabitant of
<HI>North America,</HI> who means to maintain the new erect|ed
governments there, cannot take the oath of alle|giance.</P>
<P>2. The oath excludes all de&s;ign, at the time, of attempt|ing
to depo&s;e the reigning prince, for any rea&s;on whatever.
Let the ju&s;tice of the Revolution be what it would, no ho|ne&s;t
man could have taken even the pre&s;ent path of alle|giance
to <HI>James the &s;econd,</HI> who entertained at the time of
taking it, a de&s;ign of joining in the mea&s;ures that were
entered into to dethrone him.</P>
<P>3. The oath forbids the taking up arms again&s;t the
reigning prince, with views of private advancement, or
<PB N="171" REF="209">
from motives of per&s;onal re&s;entment or di&s;like. It might
happen, in this, what frequently happens in de&s;potic go|vernments,
that an ambitious general, at the head of the
military force of the nation, by a conjuncture of fortunate
circum&s;tances, and a great a&s;cendency over the minds of
the &s;oldiery, might depo&s;e the prince upon the throne,
and make way to it for him&s;elf, or &s;ome creature of his
own. A per&s;on in this, &s;ituation would be withheld from
&s;uch an attempt by the oath of allegiance, if he paid any
regard to it. If there were any who engaged in the rebellion
of the year forty-five, with the expectation of titles, e&s;tates,
or preferment; or becau&s;e they were di&s;appointed, and
thought them&s;elves neglected and ill u&s;ed at court; or be|cau&s;e
they; entertained a family animo&s;ity, or per&s;onal re|&s;entment
again&s;t the king, the favourite, or the mini&s;ter;
if any were induced to take up arms by the&s;e motives,
they added to the many crimes of an unprovoked rebellion,
that of wilful and corrupt perjury. If the &s;ame motives
determined others now, to connect them&s;elves with the
American oppo&s;ition; their part in it is chargeable with
perfidy and fal&s;ehood to their oath, whatever be the fate
or ju&s;tice of the oppo&s;ition it&s;elf, or however well founded
their complaints may be of private injuries.</P>
<P>We are next to con&s;ider what the oath of allegiance per|mits,
or does not require.</P>
<P>1. It permits re&s;i&s;tance to the king, when his ill be|haviour,
or imhecillity is &s;uch, as to make re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="172" REF="210">
beneficial to the community. It may fairly be pre&s;umed,
that the convention Parliament, which introduced the oath in
it's pre&s;ent form, did not mean, by impo&s;ing it, to exclude
all re&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince the members of that legi&s;lature had
many of them, recently taken up arms again&s;t <HI>James the
&s;econd;</HI> and the very authority by which they &s;at together,
was it&s;elf the effect of a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition, to an acknow|ledged
&s;overeign; and if any re&s;i&s;tance be allowed it mu&s;t
be that which has the public intere&s;t for it's object.</P>
<P>2. The oath does not require obedience to &s;uch com|mands
of the king, as are unauthori&s;ed by law. No &s;uch
obedience is implied by the terms of the oath; the <HI>fidelity</HI>
there promi&s;ed, is intended of fidelity in oppo&s;ition to his
enemies, and not in oppo&s;ition to law; and <HI>allegiance,</HI> at

our allegiance to the king, after he is actually and ab&s;olute|ly

exerci&s;e the power, and afford the protection, which be|longs

power, which makes &s;uch a particular per&s;on the object of
the oath; without it, why &s;hould I &s;wear allegiance to this

the contrary doctrine is burthened with this con&s;e|&s;equence,

obtaining of a pre&s;entation by pecuniary con&s;iderations, has
been called <HI>Simony.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="213">
The &s;ale of advow&s;ons is in&s;eparable from the right of
private patronage; as patronage would otherwi&s;e devolve
to the mo&s;t indigent, and for that rea&s;on, the mo&s;t impro|per
hands it could be placed in. Nor did the law ever intend
to prohibit the &s;ale of ad vow&s;ons from one patron to another;
but to re&s;train the patron, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the right of pre|&s;enting
at the vacancy, from being influenced, in the choice
of his pre&s;entee, by a bribe, of benefit to him&s;elf. It is
the &s;ame distinction with that which obtains in a free|holders
vote for his repre&s;entative in parliament. The right
of voting, that is the freehold, to which the right pertains,
may be bought and &s;old, as freely as any other property;
but the exerci&s;e of that right, the vote it&s;elf, may not be
purcha&s;ed, or influenced by money.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the law impo&s;es upon the pre&s;entee,
who is generally concerned in the &s;imony, if there be any,
the following oath: &startq;I do &s;wear, that I have made no
<HI>&s;imoniacal</HI> payment, contract, or promi&s;e, directly or in|directly,
by my&s;elf, or by any other to my knowledge,
or with my con&s;ent, to any per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;o|ever,
for or concerning the procuring and obtaining of
this eccle&s;ia&s;tical place, &amp;c. nor will, at any time here-after,
perform, or &s;atisfy, any &s;uch kind of payment,
contract, or promi&s;e, made by any other without my
knowledge or con&s;ent: So help me God, through Je&s;us
Chri&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="214">
It is extraordinary, that bi&s;hop <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> &s;hould have thought
this oath again&s;t all promi&s;es what&s;oever, when the terms
of the oath expre&s;sly re&s;train it to <HI>&s;imoniacal</HI> promi&s;es; and
the law mu&s;t pronounce what promi&s;es, as well as what
payments, and contracts, are &s;imoniacal, and con&s;equently
come within the oath; and what are not &s;o.</P>
<P>Now the law$adjudges to be &s;imony,</P>
<P>1. All payments, contracts, or promi&s;es, made by any
per&s;on, for a benefice already vacant. The advow&s;on of a
void turn, by law cannot be transferred from one patron to
another; therefore if the void turn be procured by money,
it mu&s;h be by a pecuniary influence upon the then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
patron in the choice of his pre&s;entee; which is the very
practice the law condemns.</P>
<P>2. A clergyman's purcha&s;ing of the next turn of a bene|fice
for him&s;elf, &startq;directly or indiredtly,&endq; that is, by him|&s;elf,
or by another per&s;on with his money. It does not
appear, that the law prohibits a clergyman, from percha&s;ing
the perpetuity of a patronage, more than any other
per&s;on; but purchasing the perpetuity, and forthwith &s;el|ling
it again, with a re&s;ervation of the next turn, and with
no other de&s;ign than to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the next turn, is
in <HI>fraudem legis,</HI> and incon&s;i&s;tent with the oath.</P>
<P>3. The procuring of a piece of preferment, by ceding to
the patron, any rights, or probable rights, belonging to it.
<PB N="177" REF="215">
This is &s;imony of the wor&s;t kind; for it is not only buying
preferment, but robbing your &s;ucce&s;&s;or to pay for it.</P>
<P>4. Promi&s;es to the patron of a portion of the profit, re|mi&s;&s;ion
of tythes and dues, or other advantage out of the
produce of the benefice; which is a pernicious conde&s;cen|&s;ion
in the clergy, independent of the oath, for it tends to in|troduce
a practice, which may very &s;oon become general, of
giving the revenues of churches to the lay patrons, and
&s;upplying the duty by indigent &s;tipendaries.</P>
<P>5. General bonds of re&s;ignat&igrave;on (that is, bonds to re&s;ign
upon demand) when intended to &s;ecure any of the above-mentioned
purpo&s;es; to which u&s;e they may always be con|verted.</P>
<P>I doubt not but that the oath is binding upon the con|&s;ciences
of tho&s;e who take it, though I que&s;tion much the
expediency of requiring it. It is very fit to debar public
patrons, &s;uch as the king, the lord chancellor, bi&s;hops,
eccle&s;ia&s;tical corporations, and the like, from this kind of
traffic; becau&s;e, from them may be expected &s;ome regard
to the qualifications of the per&s;ons they promote. But the
oath lays a &s;nare for the integrity of the clergy; and I do
not perceive, that the requiring of it, in ca&s;es of private
patronage, produces any good effect, &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate
for this danger.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="216">
Where advow&s;ons are held along with manors, or other

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Wills.</HEAD>
<P>THE fundamental que&s;tion upon this &s;ubject is, whe|ther
Wills are of natural or of adventitious right?
that is, whether the right of directing the di&s;po&s;ition of
property after his death, belong to a man in a &s;tate of na|ture,
and by the law of nature, or whether it be given
him entirely by the po&s;itive regulations of the country he
lives in?</P>
<P>The immediate produce of each man's per&s;onal labour,
as the tools, weapons, and uten&s;ils, which he manufac|tures,
the tent or hut he builds, and perhaps the flocks
and herds which he breeds and rears, are as much his own
as the labour was which he employed upon them, that
is, are his property naturally and ab&s;olutely, and con&s;e|quently
he may give or leave them to whom he plea&s;es,
there being nothing to limit the continuance of his right,
or to re&s;train the alienation of it.</P>
<P>But every other &s;pecies of property, e&s;pecially property
in land, &s;tands upon a different foundation.</P>
<P>We have &s;een in the Chapter upon Property, that, in a
&s;tate of nature, a man's right to a particular &s;pot of ground
<PB N="184" REF="222">
ari&s;es from his u&s;ing it, and wanting it; con&s;equently
cea&s;es with the u&s;e and want; &s;o that at his death the e&s;tate
reverts to the community, without any regard to the la&s;t
owner's will, or even any preference to his family, farther
than as they become the fir&s;t occupiers after him, and &s;uc|ceed
to the &s;ame want and u&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover, as natural rights cannot, like rights created
by act of parliament, expire at the end of a certain number
of years; if the te&s;tator have a right by the law of nature,
to di&s;po&s;e of his property one moment after his death, he
has the &s;ame right to direct the di&s;po&s;ition of it, for a mil|lion
of ages after him; which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The ancient apprehen&s;ions of mankind upon the &s;ubject
were conformable to this account of it; for wills have been
introduced into mo&s;t countries by a po&s;itive act of the
&s;tate, as by the laws of <HI>Solon</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> by the twelve ta|bles
into <HI>Rome;</HI> and that, not till after a con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s
had been made in legi&s;lation and the oeconomy of
civil life. <HI>Tacitus</HI> relates, that among&s;t the <HI>Germans</HI> they
were di&s;allowed; and, what is more remarkable, &s;ince the
Conque&s;t, lands in this country could not be devized by will,
till within little more than two hundred years ago, when
this privilege was re&s;tored to the &s;ubject, by an act of par|liament
in the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>No doubt many beneficial purpo&s;es are attained by ex|tending
the owner's power over his property, beyond his
<PB N="185" REF="223">
life, and beyond his natural right. It invites to indu&s;try;
it encourages marriage; it &s;ecures the dutifulne&s;s and de|pendency
of children. But a period mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to the
duration of this power. The utmo&s;t extent to which, in
any ca&s;e, entails are allowed by the laws of <HI>England</HI> to ope|rate,
is during the lives in exi&s;tence at the death of the te&s;|tator,
and one and twenty years beyond the&s;e: after which
there are ways and means of &s;etting them a&s;ide.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ideration that wills are the creatures of
the municipal law which gives them their efficacy, may be
deduced a determination of the que&s;tion, whether the in|tention
of the te&s;tator in an <HI>informal</HI> will be binding
upon the con&s;cience of tho&s;e, who, by operation of law,
&s;ucceed to his e&s;tate. By an <HI>informal</HI> will, I mean a will
void in law, for want of &s;ome requi&s;ite formality,
though no doubt be entertained of it's meaning or authen|ticity:
as &s;uppo&s;e a man make his will, devi&s;ing his
freehold e&s;tate to his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, and the will be atte&s;ted
by two only, in&s;tead of three &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;&s;es; would
the brother's &s;on, who is heir at law to the te&s;tator, be
bound in con&s;cience, to re&s;ign his claim to the e&s;tate, out
of deference to his uncle's intention? Or, on the contrary,
would not the devi&s;ee under the will be bound, upon di&s;|covery
of this flaw in it, to &s;urrender the e&s;tate, &s;uppo&s;e he
had gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, to the heir at law?</P>
<P>Generally &s;peaking, the heir at law is not bound by the
intention of the te&s;tator. For the intention can &s;ignify no|thing,
<PB N="186" REF="224">
unle&s;s the per&s;on intending have a right to govern
the de&s;cent of the e&s;tate. That is the fir&s;t que&s;tion. Now
this right the te&s;tator can only derive from the law of the
land; but the law confers the right upon certain condi|tions,
which conditions he has not complied with. There|fore
the te&s;tator can lay no claim to the power which he
pretends to exerci&s;e, as he hath not entitled him&s;elf to the
benefit of that law, by virtue of which alone, the e&s;tate
ought to attend his di&s;po&s;al. Con&s;equently the devi&s;ee
under the will, who, by concealing this flaw in it, keeps
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, is in the &s;ituation of any other per|&s;on,
who avails him&s;elf of his neighbour's ignorance, to de|tain
from him his property. The will is &s;o much wa&s;te
paper, from the defect of right in the per&s;on who made it.
Nor is this catching at an expre&s;&s;ion of law to pervert the
&s;ub&s;tantial de&s;ign of it, for I apprehend it to be the delibe|rate
mind of the legi&s;lature, that no will &s;hould take effect
upon real e&s;tates, unle&s;s authenticated in the preci&s;e man|ner
which the &s;tatute de&s;cribes. Had te&s;tamentary di&s;po|&s;itions
been founded in any natural right, independant of
po&s;itive con&s;titutions, I &s;hould have thought differently of
this que&s;tion. For then I &s;hould have cou&s;idered the law,
rather as refu&s;ing it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to enfore the right of the de|vi&s;ee,
than as extingui&s;hing, or working any alteration in
the right it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And after all, I &s;hould chu&s;e to propo&s;e a ca&s;e, where no
con&s;ideration of pity to di&s;tre&s;s, duty to a parent, or grati|tude
<PB N="187" REF="225">
to a benefactor, interfered with the general rule of
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The regard due to kindred in the di&s;po&s;al of our fortune,
(except the ca&s;e of lineal kindred, which is different)
ari&s;es, either from the re&s;pect we owe to the pre&s;umed in|tention
of the ance&s;tor, from whom we received our for|tunes,
or from the expectations we have encouraged. The
intention of the ance&s;tor is pre&s;umed with greater certainty,
as well as entitled to more re&s;pect, the fewer degrees he is
removed from us, which makes the difference in the dif|ferent
degrees of kindred. It may be pre&s;umed to be a fa|ther's
intention and de&s;ire, that the inheritance he leaves,
after it has &s;erved the turn and generation of one &s;on, &s;hould
remain a provi&s;ion for the families of his other children,
equally related, and dear to him as the elde&s;t. Whoever
therefore, without cau&s;e, gives away his patrimony from
his brother's or &s;i&s;ter's family, is guilty not &s;o much of an
injury to them, as of ingratitude to his parent. The de|ference
due from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a fortune, to the pre&s;umed
de&s;ire of his ance&s;tor, will al&s;o vary with this circum&s;tance,
whether the ance&s;tor earned the fortune by his per&s;onal in|du&s;try,
acquired it by accidental &s;ucce&s;&s;es, or only trans|mitted
the inheritance which he received.</P>
<P>Where a man's fortune is acquired by him&s;elf, and he
has done nothing to excite expectation, but rather refrained
from tho&s;e particular attentions which tend to cheri&s;h ex|pectation,
he is perfectly di&s;engaged from the force of the
<PB N="188" REF="226">
above rea&s;ons, and at liberty to leave his fortune to his
friends, to charitable or public purpo&s;es, or to whom he
will; the &s;ame blood, proximity of blood, and the like, are
merely modes of &s;peech, implying nothing real, nor any
obligation of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There is always, however, a rea&s;on for providing for our
poor relations, in preference to others who may be equally
nece&s;&s;itous, which is, that if we do not, no body el&s;e will;
mankind, by an e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;ent, leaving the reduced
branches of good families, to the bounty of their wealthy
alliances.</P>
<P>The not making a will is a very culpable omi&s;&s;ion, where
it is attended with the following effects: where it leaves
daughters or younger children at the mercy of the elde&s;t
&s;on; where it di&s;tributes a per&s;onal fortune equally among&s;t
the children, although there be no equality in their exi|gences
or &s;ituations; where it leaves an opening for litiga|tion;
or la&s;tly, and principally, where it defrauds creditors;
for by a defect in our laws, which has been long and
&s;trangely overlooked, real e&s;tates are not &s;ubject to the pay|ment
of debts by &s;imple contract, unle&s;s made &s;o by will;
although credit is in fact generally given to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch e&s;tates. He therefore, who neglects to make the
nece&s;&s;ary appointments for the payment of his debts, as far
as his effects extend, &s;ins, as it has been ju&s;tly &s;aid in his
grave; and, if he omits this on purpo&s;e to defeat the de|mands
<PB N="189" REF="227">
of his creditors, he dies with a deliberate fraud in
his heart.</P>
<P>Anciently, when any one died without a will, the bi|&s;hop
of the dioce&s;e took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his per&s;onal fortune,
in order to di&s;po&s;e of it for the benefit of his &s;oul, that is,
to pious or charitable u&s;es. It became nece&s;&s;ary therefore,
that the bi&s;hop &s;hould be &s;atisfied of the authenticity of the
will, when there was any, before he re&s;igned the right
he had to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dead man's fortune, in
ca&s;e of inte&s;tacy. In this way, wills, and controver&s;ies
relating to wills, came within the cognizance of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
courts; under the juri&s;diction of which, wills
of per&s;onals (the only wills that were made formerly)
&s;till continue; though, in truth, no more now-a-days
connected with religion, than any other in&s;truments of
conveyance.</P>
<P>Succe&s;&s;ion in e&s;tates mu&s;t be regulated by po&s;itive rules
of law, there being no principle of natural ju&s;tice where|by
to a&s;certain the proportion of the different claimants;
not to mention that the claim it&s;elf, e&s;pecially of collateral
kindred, &s;eems to have little foundation in the law of na|ture.
The&s;e regulations &s;hould be guided by the duty and
pre&s;umed inclination of the decea&s;ed, &s;o far as the&s;e con&s;i|derations
can be con&s;ulted by general rules. The &s;tatutes
of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd, commonly called the &s;tatutes of di&s;|tribution,
which adopt the rule of the <HI>Roman</HI> law, in the
di&s;tribution of per&s;onals, are &s;ufficiently equitable. They
<PB N="190" REF="228">
a&s;&s;ign one third to the widow, and two thirds to the chil|dren;
in ca&s;e of no children, one half to the widow, and
the other half to the next of kin; where neither widow
nor lineal de&s;cendents &s;urvive, the whole to the next of
kin, and to be equally divided among&s;t kindred of equal
degrees; without di&s;tinction of whole blood and half blood,
or of con&s;anguinity by the father's or mother's &s;ide.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent of real e&s;tates, of hou&s;es, that is, and land,
having been &s;ettled in more remote and ruder times, is
le&s;s rea&s;onable. There never can be much to complain of
in a rule, which every per&s;on may avoid by &s;o ea&s;y a pro|vi&s;ion,
as that of making his will; otherwi&s;e our law in
this re&s;pect, is chargeable with &s;ome flagrant ab&s;urdities;
&s;uch as that an e&s;tate &s;hall in no wi&s;e go to the brother or
&s;i&s;ter of the half blood, though it came to the decea&s;ed
from the common parent; that it &s;hall go to the re|mote&s;t
relation the inte&s;tate has in the world, rather
than to his own father or mother, or even be forfeited for
want of an heir, though both parents &s;urvive; that the
mo&s;t di&s;tant paternal relation &s;hall be preferred to an uncle
or own cou&s;in by the mother's &s;ide, notwith&s;tanding the
e&s;tate was purcha&s;ed and acquired by the inte&s;tate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Land not being &s;o divi&s;ible as money, may be a rea&s;on for
making a difference in the cour&s;e of inheritance, but there
ought to be no difference but what is founded upon that
rea&s;on. The <HI>Roman</HI> law made none.</P>

<P>A PARTY of friends &s;etting out together upon a
journey, &s;oon find it to be the be&s;t for all &s;ides, that
while they are upon the road, one of the company &s;hould
wait upon the re&s;t; another ride forward to &s;eek out lodg|ing
and entertainment; a third carry the portmanteau; a
fourth take charge of the hor&s;es; a fifth bear the pur&s;e,
<PB N="193" REF="231">
conduct and direct the rout: not forgetting however,
that as they were equal and independant when they &s;et out,
&s;o they are all to return to a level again at their journey's
end. The &s;ame regard and re&s;pect; the &s;ame forbearance,
lenity, and tenderne&s;s in u&s;ing their &s;ervice; the &s;ame
mildne&s;s in delivering commands; the &s;ame &s;tudy to make
their journey comfortable and agreeable to them, which
he, who&s;e lot it was to direct the re&s;t, would in common
decency think him&s;elf bound to ob&s;erve towards them;
ought we to &s;hew to tho&s;e, who, in the ca&s;ting of the
parts of human &s;ociety, happen to be placed within our
power, or to depend upon us.</P>
<P>Another reflection of the &s;ame tendency is, that our
obligation to them is much greater than their's to us. It
is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that the rich man maintains his
&s;ervants, trade&s;men, tenants, and labourers: the truth is,
they maintain him. It is their indu&s;try which &s;upplies his
table, furni&s;hes his wardrobe, builds his hou&s;es, adorns
his equipage, provides his amu&s;ements. It is not his
e&s;tate, but the labour employed upon it, that pays his
rent. All that he does, is to di&s;tribute what others pro|duce;
which is the lea&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor do I perceive any foundation for an opinion, which
is often handed round in genteel company, that good u&s;age
is thrown away upon low and ordinary minds; that they
are in&s;en&s;ible of kindne&s;s, and incapable of gratitude.
It by &startq;low and ordinary minds&endq; are meant the minds of
<PB N="194" REF="232">
men in low and ordinary &s;tations, they &s;eem to be affected
by benefits in the &s;ame way that all others are; and to
be no le&s;s ready to requite them: and it would be a very
odd law of nature, if it were otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Whatever unea&s;ine&s;s we occa&s;ion to our dome&s;tics, which
neither promotes our &s;ervice, nor an&s;wers the ju&s;t ends of
puni&s;hment, is manife&s;tly wrong; were it only upon the
general principle of dimini&s;hing the &s;um of human happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>By which rule we are forbidden,</P>
<P>1. To injoin unnece&s;&s;ary labour or confinement, from

<P>2. To in&s;ult them by har&s;h, &s;cornful, or opprobrious
language.</P>
<P>3. To refu&s;e them any harmle&s;s plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>And by the &s;ame principle are al&s;o forbidden cau&s;ele&s;s

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>THE prohibitions of the la&s;t chapter extend to the
treatment of &s;laves, being founded upon a prin|ciple
independant of the contract between ma&s;ters and &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>I define &s;lavery to be &startq;an obligation to labour for the
benefit of the ma&s;ter, without the contract or con&s;ent of
the &s;ervant.&endq;</P>
<P>This obligation may ari&s;e, con&s;i&s;tently with the law of
nature, from three cau&s;es.</P>
<P>1. From crimes.</P>
<P>2. From captivity.</P>
<P>3. From debt.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the continuance of the &s;lavery, as of
any other puni&s;hment, &s;hould be proportioned to the crime;
in the &s;econd and third ca&s;es, it &s;hould cea&s;e, as &s;oon as
the demand of the injured nation, or private creditor, is
&s;atisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="234">
When &s;laves are brought to market upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> no questions, I believe, are a&s;ked about the origin
or ju&s;tice of the vendor's title. It may be pre&s;umed there|fore,
that this title is not always, if it be ever founded in
any of the cau&s;es above a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>But defect of right in the fir&s;t purcha&s;e is the lea&s;t crime,
with which this traffic is chargeable. On one &s;ide of the
<HI>Atlantic,</HI> the natives are excited to war and mutual depre|dation,
for the &s;ake of &s;upplying their contracts, or fur|ni&s;hing
the market with &s;laves. The &s;laves, thus &s;eparated
for ever from parents, wives, children, from their friends and
companions, their fields and flocks, their home and coun|try,
are tran&s;ported with no other accommodation on &s;hip|board,
than what is provided for brutes, to the <HI>European</HI>
&s;ettlements in <HI>America</HI>&mdash;where the&s;e unhappy exiles are
placed in &s;ubjection to a dominion and &s;y&s;tem of laws, the
mo&s;t mercile&s;s and tyrannical that ever were tolerated upon
the face of the earth: and from all that can be learned by
the accounts of people upon the &s;pot, the inordinate au|thority,
which the plantation laws confer upon the &s;lave-holder,
is exerci&s;ed, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;lave-holder e&s;pecially,
with rigor and brutality.</P>
<P>But a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is pretended; the name under which all
enormities are attempted to be excu&s;ed. And after all, what
is the nece&s;&s;ity? It was never pretended that the land
could not be cultivated there, as it is here, by hired &s;er|vants;
only that it could not be cultivated with quite
<PB N="197" REF="235">
the &s;ame conveniency and cheapne&s;s, as by the labour of
&s;laves. By which means, a pound of &s;ugar, which the
planter now &s;ells for &s;ixpence, could not be afforded
under &s;ixpence halfpenny; and this is the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>The great revolution which, &s;eems preparing in the
We&s;tern world, may probably conduce, and who knows,
but that it is de&s;igned to accelerate the fall of this abo|minable
tyranny: and when this conte&s;t, and the pa&s;|&s;ions
that attend it are no more, there will &s;ucceed a &s;ea&s;on
for reflecting, whether a legi&s;lature, which had &s;o long
lent it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;upport of an in&s;titution replete
with human mi&s;ery, was fit to be tru&s;ted with an empire,
the mo&s;t exten&s;ive that ever obtained in any age or quarter
of the world.</P>
<P>Slavery was a part of the civil con&s;titution of mo&s;t
countries, when Chri&s;tianity appeared, yet no pa&s;&s;age is
to be found in the Chri&s;tian &s;criptures, by which it is con|demned
or prohibited. This is true; for Chri&s;tianity,
&s;oliciting admi&s;&s;ion into all nations of the world, ab&s;tained,
as behoved it, from intermeddling with the civil in&s;titu|tions
of any. But does it follow, from the &s;ilence of
&s;cripture concerning them, that all the civil in&s;titutions
which then prevailed, were right? or that the bad &s;hould
not be exchanged for better?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the di&s;charging &s;laves from all obligation
to obey their ma&s;ters, which is the con&s;equence of pro|nouncing
<PB N="198" REF="236">
&s;lavery to be unlawful, would have had no bet|ter
effect, than to let loo&s;e one half of mankind upon the
other. Slaves would have been tempted to embrace a reli|gion,
which a&s;&s;erted their right to freedom. Ma&s;ters
would hardly have been per&s;uaded to con&s;ent to claims
founded upon &s;uch authority. The mo&s;t calamitous of all
conte&s;ts, a <HI>bellum &s;ervile,</HI> might probably have en&s;ued, to
the reproach, if not the extinction of the Chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>The truth is, the emancipation of &s;laves &s;hould be gra|dual;
and carried on by provi&s;ions of law, and under the
protection of civil government. Chri&s;tianity can only ope|rate
as an alterative. By the mild diffu&s;ion of it's light
and influence, the minds of men are in&s;en&s;ibly prepared to
perceive and correct the enormities, which folly, or wick|edne&s;s,
or accident, have introduced into their public e&s;ta|bli&s;hments.
In this way the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> &s;lavery, and
&s;ince the&s;e, the feudal tyranny has declined before it.
And we tru&s;t that as the knowledge and authority of the
&s;ame religion advance in the world, they will bani&s;h what
remains of this odious in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Profe&s;&s;ional A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kind of beneficence is chiefly to be expected
from members of the legi&s;lature, magi&s;trates,
medical, legal, and &s;acerdotal profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>1. The care of the poor ought to be the principal object
of all laws, for this plain rea&s;on, that the rich are able to
take care of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Much has been, and more might be done, by the laws
of this country, towards the relief of the impotent, and the
protection and encouragement of the indu&s;trious poor.
Whoever applies him&s;elf to collect ob&s;ervations upon the
&s;tate and operation of the poor laws; and to contrive re|medies
for the imperfections and abu&s;es he ob&s;erves; and
dige&s;ts the&s;e remedies into acts of parliament; and con|ducts
them by argument or influence through the two
branches of the legi&s;lature; or communicates his ideas to
tho&s;e, who are more likely to carry them into effect; de|&s;erves
well of a cla&s;s of the community &s;o numerous, that
<PB N="200" REF="238">
their happine&s;s makes no incon&s;iderable part of the whole. The &s;tudy and activity thus employed is charity, in the
mo&s;t meritorious &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>2. The care of the poor is intru&s;ted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance
to over&s;eers and contractors, who have an intere&s;t in oppo|&s;ition
to that of the poor, ina&s;much as whatever they afford
them, comes in part out of their own pocket. For this
rea&s;on, the law has depo&s;ited with ju&s;tices of the peace, a
power of &s;uperintendence and control; and the judicious
interpo&s;ition of this power is a mo&s;t u&s;eful exertion of cha|rity,
and oftimes within the ability of tho&s;e, who have no
other way of &s;erving their generation. A country gentle|man,
of very moderate education, and who has little to
&s;pare from his fortune, by learning &s;o much of the poor
law, as is to be found in Dr. <HI>Burn's Ju&s;tice,</HI> and furni&s;hing
him&s;elf with a knowledge of the prices of labour and pro|vi&s;ion,
&s;o as to be able to e&s;timate the exigences of a family,
and what is to be expected from their indu&s;try, may, in
this way, place out the one talent committed to him, to
great account.</P>
<P>3. Of all private profe&s;&s;ions, that of medicine puts it in
a man's power to do the mo&s;t good at the lea&s;t expence.
Health, which is precious to all, is to the poor invaluable;
and their complaints, as agues, rheumati&s;ms, &amp;c. are often
&s;uch as yield to medicine. And as to the expence, drugs
at fir&s;t hand co&s;t little, and advice nothing, where it is only
be&s;towed upon tho&s;e who could not afford to pay for it.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="239">
4. The rights of the poor are not &s;o important or intri|cate,
as their contentions are violent and ruinous. A
Lawyer or Attorney of tolerable knowledge in his profe&s;|&s;ion,
has commonly judgment enough to adju&s;t the&s;e di&s;|putes,
with all the effect, and without the expence of a
law &s;uit; and he may be &s;aid to give a poor man twenty
pounds, who prevents his throwing it away upon law.
A <HI>legal</HI> man, whether of the profe&s;&s;ion or not, who toge|ther
with a &s;pirit of conciliation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the confidence
of his neighbourhood, will be much re&s;orted to for this
purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially &s;ince the great increa&s;e of co&s;ts has
produced a general dread of going to law.</P>
<P>Nor is this line of beneficence confined to <HI>arbitration.</HI>
Sea&s;onable coun&s;el coming with the weight which the re|putation
of the advi&s;er gives it, will often keep or extri|cate
the ra&s;h and un-informed out of great difficulties.
And I know not a more exalted charity than that, which
pre&s;ents a &s;hield again&s;t the rapacity or per&s;ecution of a
tyrant.</P>
<P>5. Betwixt argument and authority (I mean that autho|rity,
which flows, from voluntary re&s;pect, and attends up|on
&s;anctity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of character) &s;omething
may be done among&s;t the lower orders of mankind, to|wards
the regulation of their conduct, and the &s;atisfac|tion
of their thoughts. This office belongs to the mini|&s;ters
of religion; or rather whoever undertakes it becomes
a mini&s;ter of religion. The inferior clergy, who are
<PB N="202" REF="240">
nearly upon a level with the common &s;ort of their pari&s;h|ioners,
and on that account, gain an ea&s;ier admi&s;&s;ion to
their &s;ociety and confidence, have in this re&s;pect more in
their power than their &s;uperiors; and the di&s;creet u&s;e of
this power con&s;titutes one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable functi|ons

<P>THOSE, who rank pity among&s;t the original impul|&s;es
of our nature, rightly contend, that when it
prompts us to the relief of human mi&s;ery, it indicates
&s;ufficiently the divine intention, and our duty. Indeed
the &s;ame conclu&s;ion is deducible from the exi&s;tence of the
pa&s;&s;ion whatever account be given of its origin. Whether
it be an in&s;tinct or a habit, it is in fact a property of our
<PB N="203" REF="241">
nature, which God appointed: And the final cau&s;e, for
which it was appointed, is to afford to the mi&s;erable, in
the compa&s;&s;ion of their fellow creatures, a remedy for
tho&s;e inequalities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which God fore&s;aw
that many mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to, under every general rule for
the di&s;tribution of property.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the poor have a claim founded in the law
of nature, which may be thus explained. All things
were originally common: no one being able to produce a
charter from Heaven had any better title to a particular
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than his next neighbour. There were rea&s;ons
for mankind's agreeing upon a &s;eparation of this common
fund; and God for the&s;e rea&s;ons, is pre&s;umed to have ra|tified
it. But this &s;eparation was made and con&s;ented to,
upon the expectation and condition, that every one &s;hould
have left a &s;ufficiency for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or the means of
procuring it; and as no fixed laws for the regulation of
property can be &s;o contrived, as to provide for the relief
of every ca&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s which may ari&s;e, the&s;e ca&s;es
and di&s;trer&s;&s;es, when their right and &s;hare in the common
&s;tock was given up or taken from them, were &s;uppo&s;ed to
be left to the voluntary bounty of tho&s;e, who might be
acquainted with the exigencies of their &s;ituation, and in
the way of affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And therefore, when
the partition of propriety is rigidly maintained again&s;t the
claims of indigence and di&s;tre&s;s, it is maintained in oppo|&s;ition
to the intention of tho&s;e who made it, and to <HI>his,</HI>
who is the Supreme Proprietor of every thing, and who
<PB N="204" REF="242">
has filled the world with plenteou&s;ne&s;s for the &s;u&s;tentation
and comfort of all whom he &s;ends into it.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian &s;criptures are more copious and explicit
upon this duty than almo&s;t any other. The de&s;crip|tion
which Chri&s;t hath left us of the proceedings of
the la&s;t day, e&s;tabli&s;hes the obligation of bounty, &s;o far

only a &s;cenical di&s;cription of the rules and principles, by which
the &s;upreme arbiter of our de&s;tiny will regulate his deci&s;i|ons,
it conveys the &s;ame le&s;&s;on to us; it equally demon|&s;trates
of how great value and importance the&s;e duties in
<PB N="205" REF="243">
the &s;ight of God are, and what &s;tre&s;s will be laid upon
them. The Apo&s;tles al&s;o describe this virtue as propitiat|ing
the divine favour in an eminent degree. And the&s;e
recommendations have produced their effect. It does not
appear that before the times of Chri&s;tianity, a Ho&s;pital,
Infirmary, or public charity of any kind, exi&s;ted in the
world; whereas mo&s;t countries in Chri&s;tendom have long
abounded with the&s;e in&s;titutions. To which may be add|ed,
that a &s;pirit of private liberality &s;eems to flouri&s;h a|mid&s;t
the decay of many other virtues: not to mention
the legal provi&s;ion for the poor, which obtains in this
country, and which was unknown and unthought of by
the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations of antiquity.</P>
<P>St. Paul adds upon the &s;ubject an excellent direction;
and which is practicable by all who have any thing to give.
&startq;Upon the fir&s;t day of the week (or any other &s;tated
time) let every one of you lay by in &s;tore, as God hath
pro&s;pered him.&endq; By which I under&s;tand St. Paul to
recommend, what is the very thing wanting with mo&s;t
men, <HI>the being charitable upon a plan;</HI> that is, from a delibe|rate
compari&s;on of our fortunes, with the rea&s;onable ex|pences
and expectations of our families; to compute
what we can &s;pare, and to lay by &s;o much for charitable
purpo&s;es, in &s;ome mode or other. The <HI>mode</HI> will be a
con&s;ideration afterwards.</P>
<P>The effect, which Chri&s;tianity produced upon &s;ome of
its fir&s;t converts, was &s;uch as might be looked for, from a
divine religion coming with full force and miraculous
<PB N="206" REF="244">
evidence, upon the con&s;ciences of mankind. It over-whelmed
all worldly con&s;iderations in the expectation of
a more important exi&s;tence. &startq;And the multitude of them
that believed were of one heart and of one &s;oul; nei|ther
&s;aid any of them that aught of the things, which
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was his own; but they had all things in
common.&mdash;Neither was there any among them that
lacked; for as many as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of lands or
hou&s;es &s;old them, and brought the prices of the things
that were &s;old, and laid them down, at the apo&s;tles feet;
and di&s;tribution was made unto every man, according as
he had need.&endq; Acts iv, 32.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s this community of goods, however it ma|nife&s;ted
the &s;incere zeal of the primitive chri&s;tians, is no
precedent for our imitation. It was confined to the church
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> continued not long there; was never en|joined
upon any (Acts. v. 4.); and altho' it might &s;uit
with the particular circum&s;tances of a &s;mall, and &s;elect
&s;ociety, is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed
community.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Apo&s;tles upon the occa&s;ion de&s;erves
to be noticed. Their followers laid down their fortunes
at their feet; but &s;o far were they from taking advantage
of this unlimited confidence, to enrich them&s;elves or
e&s;tabli&s;h their authority, that they &s;oon after got rid of this
bu&s;ine&s;s, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the main object of their mi&s;|&s;ion,
and transferred the cu&s;tody and management of the
<PB N="207" REF="245">
public fund to deacons, elected to that office by the people
at large. (Acts. vi).</P>
<P>II. <HI>The manner of be&s;towing bounty&mdash;or the different kinds of charity.</HI></P>
<P>Every que&s;tion between the different kinds of charity
&s;uppo&s;es the &s;um be&s;towed to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There are three kinds of charity which prefer a claim
to attention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and, in my judgment one of the be&s;t, is to
give &s;tated and con&s;iderable &s;ums, by way of pen&s;ion or
annuity, to individuals or families with who&s;e behaviour
and di&s;tre&s;s we our&s;elves are acquainted. When I &s;peak of
<HI>con&s;iderable</HI> &s;ums, I mean only, that five pounds, or any
other &s;um, given at once, or divided among&s;t five or fewer
families, will do more good than the &s;ame &s;um, di&s;tributed
among&s;t a greater number in &s;hillings or half crowns;
and that, becau&s;e it is more likely in the former way to be
properly applied by the per&s;ons who receive it. A poor
fellow, who can find no better u&s;e for a &s;hilling, than to
drink his benefactor's health, and purcha&s;e half an hour's
recreation for him&s;elf, would hardly break into a guinea
for any $uch purpo&s;e, or be &s;o improvident, as not to lay it
by, for an occa&s;ion of importance, for his rent, his cloath|ing,
fuel, or &s;tock of winter's provi&s;ion. It is a &s;till grea|ter
recommendation of this kind of charity, that pen&s;ions
<PB N="208" REF="246">
and annuities, which are paid regularly, and can be expect|ed
at the time, are the only way by which we can pre|vent
one part of a poor man's &s;ufferings, the dread of
want.</P>
<P>2. But as this kind of charity &s;uppo&s;es that proper ob|jects
of &s;uch expen&s;ive benefactions, fall within our pri|vate
knowledge and ob&s;ervation, which does not happen to
all, a &s;econd method of doing good, which is in every
one's power, who has the money to &s;pare, is by &s;ub&s;crip|tion
to public charities. Public charities admit of this
argument in their favour, that your money goes farther
in this way, towards attaining the end, for which it is
given, than it can do by any private and &s;eparate benefi|cence.
A guinea for example, contributed to an Infirma|ry,
becomes the means of providing one patient at lea&s;t,
with a phy&s;ician, &s;urgeon, apothecary, with medicine,
diet, lodging, and &s;uitable attendance; which is not the
tenth part, of what the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if it could be pro|cured
at all, would co&s;t to a &s;ick per&s;on or family in any
other &s;ituation.</P>
<P>3. The la&s;t, and compared with the former, the lowe&s;t
exertion of benevolence, is in the relief of beggars. Ne|verthele&s;s,
I by no means approve the indi&s;criminate re|jection
of all who implore our alms this way. Some may
peri&s;h by &s;uch a conduct. Men are &s;ometimes overtaken
by di&s;tre&s;s, for which all other relief would come too late.
Be&s;ides which, re&s;olutions of this kind compell us to offer
<PB N="209" REF="247">
&s;uch violence to our humanity, as may go near, in a little
while, to &s;uffocate the principle it&s;elf; which is a very &s;e|rious
consideration. A good man, if he do not &s;urrender
him&s;elf to his feelings without re&s;erve, will at lea&s;t lend
an ear to importunities, which come accompanied with
outward atte&s;tations of di&s;tre&s;s; and after a patient hearing
of the complaint, will direct him&s;elf by the circum&s;tances
and credibility of the account he receives.</P>
<P>There are other &s;pecies of charity well contrived to make
the money expended <HI>go far;</HI> &s;uch as keeping down the
price of fuel or provi&s;ion, in ca&s;e of a monopoly or tempo|rary
&s;carcity, by purcha&s;ing the articles at the be&s;t market,
and retailing them at prime co&s;t or a &s;mall lo&s;s; or adding
a bounty to particular &s;pecies of labour, when the price
is accidently depre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The proprietors of large e&s;tates have it in their power to
facilitate the maintenance, and thereby encourage the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of families, (which is one of the noble&s;t pur|po&s;es
to which the rich and great can convert their endea|vours)
by building cottages, &s;plitting farms, erecting ma|nufactures,
cultivating wa&s;tes, embanking the &s;ea, draining
mar&s;hes, and other expedients, which the &s;ituation of each
e&s;tate points out. If the profits of the&s;e undertakings do
not repay the expence, let the authors of them place the
difference to the account of charity. It is true of mo&s;t
&s;uch projects that the public is a gainer by them, whatever
<PB N="210" REF="248">
the owner be. And where the lo&s;s can be &s;pared, this is
con&s;ideration enough.</P>
<P>It is become a que&s;tion of &s;ome importance, under what
Circum&s;tances charity ought to be done in private, and
when it may be made public, without detracting from the
merit of the action, (if it ever may); the author of
our religion having delivered a rule upon this &s;ubject,
which &s;eems to enjoin univer&s;al &s;ecrecy. &startq;When thou
doe&s;t alms, let not thy left hand know, what thy right
hand doth; that thy alms may be in &s;ecret, and thy fa|ther
which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, him&s;elf &s;hall reward thee
openly.&endq; (Mat. vi. 3, 4.) From the preamble to this
prohibition, I think it however plain, that our Saviour's de|&s;ign
was to forbid <HI>o&s;tentation,</HI> and all publi&s;hing of good
works, which proceeds from <HI>o&s;tentation,</HI> and nothing el&s;e.
&startq;Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, <HI>to be
&s;een of them;</HI> otherwi&s;e ye have no reward of your fa|ther,
which is in Heaven: therefore when thou doe&s;t thine
alms, do not &s;ound a trumpet before thee, as the hypo|crites
do, in the &s;ynagogues and in the &s;treets, <HI>that they
may have glory of men.</HI> Verily I &s;ay unto thee they have
their reward.&endq; v. 2. There are motives for the doing
our alms in public, be&s;ides tho&s;e of <HI>o&s;tentation,</HI> with which
therefore our Saviour's rule has no concern; &s;uch as to
te&s;tify our approbation of &s;ome particular &s;pecies of cha|rity,
and to recommend it to others; to take off the pre|judice,
which the want, or which is the &s;ame thing, the
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of our name in the li&s;t of contributors might
<PB N="211" REF="249">
excite again&s;t the charity, or again&s;t our&s;elves: and, &s;o
long as the&s;e motives are free from any mixture of vanity,
they are in no danger of invading our Saviour's prohibi|tion;
they rather &s;eem to comply with another direction,
which he has left us, &startq;Let your light &s;o &s;hine before men,
that they may &s;ee your good works and glorify your fa|ther
which is in Heaven.&endq; If it be nece&s;&s;ary to pro|po&s;e
a preci&s;e di&s;tinction upon the &s;ubject, I can think
of none better than the following. When our bounty is
<HI>beyond</HI> our fortune or &s;tation, that is, when it is more than
could be expected from us, our charity &s;hould be private,
if privacy be practicable; when it is not more than might
be expected, it may be public; for we cannot hope to
influence others to the imitation of extraordinary genero|&s;ity,
and therefore want, in the former ca&s;e, the only
ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on for making it public.</P>
<P>Having thus de&s;cribed &s;everal different exertions of cha|rity,
it may not be improper to take notice of a &s;pecies of
liberality, which is not <HI>charity,</HI> in any &s;en&s;e of the word;
I mean the giving of entertainments or liquor, for the &s;ake
of popularity; or the rewarding, treating, and maintain|ing,
the companions of our diver&s;ions, as hunters, &s;hooters,
fi&s;hers, and the like. I do not &s;ay that this is criminal;
I only &s;ay that it is not charity; and that we are not to
&s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e we <HI>give,</HI> and give to the <HI>poor,</HI> that it will
&s;tand in the place, or &s;uper&s;ede the obligation, of more me|ritorious
and di&s;intere&s;ted bounty.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="250">
IV. <HI>The pretences by which men excu&s;e them&s;elves from giving to the poor.</HI></P>
<P>1. &startq;That they have nothing to &s;pare.&endq; i. e. nothing,
which they have not &s;ome other u&s;e for; nothing, which
their plan of expence, together with the &s;avings they have
re&s;olved to lay by, will not exhau&s;t: never reflecting whe|ther
it be in their <HI>power,</HI> or that it is their <HI>duty</HI> to
retrench their expences, and contract their plan, &startq;that they may have
to give to them that need;&endq; or rather that this ought to
have been part of their plan originally.</P>
<P>2. &startq;That they have families of their own, and that
charity begins at home.&endq; The extent of this plea, will
be con&s;idered when we come to explain the duty of parents.</P>
<P>3. &startq;That charity does not con&s;i&s;t in giving money, but in
benevolence, philanthropy, love to all mankind, goodne&s;s
of heart, &amp;c.&endq; Hear St. James. "If a brother or &s;i&s;ter
be naked, and de&s;titute of daily food, and one of you
&s;ay unto them, depart in peace, be you warmed and filled,
notwith&s;tanding <HI>ye give them not tho&s;e things which are need|ful
to the body,</HI> what doth it profit? (James, ii. 15, 16.)</P>
<P>4. &startq;That giving to the poor is not mentioned in St.
Paul's de&s;cription of charity, in the thirteenth chapter of
his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians.&endq; This is not a de|&s;cription
of charity, but of good nature; and it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that every duty be mentioned in every place.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="251">
5. &startq;That they pay the poor rates.&endq; They might as
well alledge that they pay their debts; for the poor have
the &s;ame right to that portion of a man's property, which
the laws a&s;&s;ign them, that the man him&s;elf has to the
remainder.</P>
<P>6. &startq;That they employ many poor per&s;ons:&endq; for their
own &s;ake, not the poor's, otherwi&s;e it is a good plea.</P>
<P>7. &startq;That the poor do not &s;uffer &s;o much as we ima|gine;
that education and habit have reconciled them to
the evils of their condition, and make them ea&s;y under it.&endq;
Habit can never reconcile any one to the extremities of
cold, hunger, and thir&s;t, any more than to the touch of a
red hot iron: be&s;ides, the que&s;tion is not, how unhappy
any one is, but how much more happy we can make him.</P>
<P>8. &startq;That the&s;e people, give them what you will, will never thank you, or think of you for it.&endq; In the fir&s;t place, this is not true; in the &s;econd place, it was not for the &s;ake of their thanks that you relieved them.</P>
<P>9. &startq;That we are &s;o liable to be impo&s;ed upon.&endq; If a
due enquiry be made, our motive and merit is the &s;ame:
be&s;ides that the di&s;tre&s;s is generally real, whatever has
been the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>10. &startq;That they &s;hould apply to their pari&s;hes.&endq; This is
not always practicable; to which we may add, that there are
<PB N="214" REF="252">
many requi&s;ites to a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which pari&s;h
relief does not always &s;upply; and that there are &s;ome,
who would &s;uffer almo&s;t as much from receiving pari&s;h
relief, as by the want of it; and la&s;tly, that there are ma|ny
modes of charity, to which this an&s;wer does not re|late
at all.</P>
<P>11. &startq;That giving money encourages idlene&s;s and va|grancy.&endq;
This is true only of injudicious and indi&s;cri|minate
genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>12. &startq;That we have too many objects of charity at
home, to be&s;tow any thing upon &s;trangers, or that there
are other charities, which are more u&s;eful or &s;tand in
greater need.&endq; The value of this excu&s;e depends entirely
upon the <HI>fact,</HI> whether we actually relieve tho&s;e
neigh|bouring
objects, and contribute to tho&s;e other charities.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e, pride, or prudery, or delicacy, or love
of ea&s;e, keep one half of the world, out of the way of ob|&s;erving
what the other half &s;uffer.</P>

as in &s;o fortifying our minds, by habits of ju&s;t reflection,
as to be le&s;s irritated by impre&s;&s;ions of injury, and to
relent &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Reflections proper for this purpo&s;e, and which may be
called the <HI>&s;edatives</HI> of anger, are the following: the po&s;|&s;ibility
of mi&s;taking the motives, from which the conduct
that offends us proceeded; how often <HI>our</HI> offences have been
the effect of inadvertency, when they were mi&s;taken
for malice; the inducement which prompted our adver&s;ary
to act as he did; and how powerfully the &s;ame inducement
has at one time or other, operated upon our&s;elves; that he
is &s;uffering perhaps under a contrition, which he is a&s;hamed,
or wants opportunity, to confe&s;s; and how ungenerous it is
to triumph by coldne&s;s or in&s;ult over a &s;pirit already hum|bled
in &s;ecret; that the returns of kindne&s;s are &s;weet; and
that there is neither honour, nor virtue, nor u&s;e in re&s;i&s;ting
them; (for &s;ome per&s;ons think them&s;elves bound to cheri&s;h
and &s;tudiou&s;ly keep alive their indignation, when they find
it dying away of it&s;elf;) we may remember that others have
their pa&s;&s;ions, their prejudices, their favourite aims, their
fears, their cautions, their intere&s;ts, their &s;udden impul&s;es,
their varieties of apprehen&s;ion, as well as we; we may
recollect what has pa&s;&s;ed in our own minds, when we have
got on the wrong &s;ide of a quarrel; and imagine the &s;ame to
be pa&s;&s;ing in our adver&s;ary's mind now; when we became
<PB N="218" REF="256">
&s;en&s;ible of our mi&s;behaviour, what palliations we perceiv|ed
in it, and expected others to perceive; how we were
affected by the kindne&s;s, and felt the &s;uperiority of a ge|nerous
reception and ready forgivene&s;s; how per&s;ecution
revived our &s;pirits with our enmity, and &s;eemed to ju&s;tify
the conduct in our&s;elves, which we before blamed. Add
to this, the indecency of extravagant anger; how it ren|ders
us, whil&s;t it la&s;ts, the &s;corn and &s;port of all about us;
of which, it leaves us, when it cea&s;es, &s;en&s;ible and a&s;hamed;
the inconveniences, and irretrievable mi&s;conduct into which
our ira&s;cibility has &s;ometimes betrayed us; the friend&s;hips
it has lo&s;t us; the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and embarra&s;&s;ments, in which
we have been involved by it; and the &s;ore repentance,
which on one account or other it always co&s;ts us.</P>
<P>But the reflection calculated above all others to bring
down that haughtine&s;s of temper, which is ever finding out
provocations, and renders anger &s;o impetuous, is that which
the go&s;pel fir&s;t propo&s;ed; namely, that we our&s;elves are,
or &s;hortly &s;hall be, &s;uppliants for mercy and pardon at the
judgement &s;eat of God. Imagine our &s;ecret &s;ins all di&s;|clo&s;ed
and brought to light; imagine us thus humbled and
expo&s;ed; trembling under the hand of God; ca&s;ting our|&s;elves
on his compa&s;&s;ion; crying out for mercy&mdash;imagine
&s;uch a creature to talk of &s;atisfaction and revenge; refu&s;ing
to be entreated, di&s;daining to forgive; extreme to mark

that is, in&s;tantly upon the receipt of an injury or af|front,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Revenge.</HEAD>
<P>ALL pain occa&s;ioned to another in con&s;equence of
an offence, or injury received from him, farther
than what is calculated to procure reparation, or promote
the ju&s;t ends of puni&s;hment, is &s;o much revenge.</P>
<P>There can be no difficulty in knowing, when we occa|&s;ion
pain to another; nor any in di&s;tingui&s;hing, whether
we do &s;o, with a view only to the ends of puni&s;hment, or
from revenge; for in the one ca&s;e we proceed with reluc|tance,
in the other with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is highly <HI>probable</HI> from the light of nature, that a
pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;eeks its gratification immediately and ex|pres&s;ly
in giving pain, is di&s;agreeable to the benevolent
<PB N="220" REF="258">
will and coun&s;els of the creator. Other pa&s;&s;ions and plea|&s;ures
may, and often do produce pain to &s;ome one; but
then pain is not, as it is here, the object of the pa&s;&s;ion, and
the cau&s;e of the plea&s;ure. This <HI>probability</HI> is converted in|to
certainty, if we give credit to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of the chri&s;|tian
&s;criptures, which condemn revenge, or what is the
&s;ame thing, which enjoin forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>We will &s;et down the principal, of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages; and
endeavour to collect from them, what conduct is upon
the whole allowed to an enemy, and what is forbidden.</P>
<P>&startq;If ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly
Father will al&s;o forgive you; but if ye forgive not men
their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.&endq; &startq;And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him
to the tormentors, till he &s;hould pay all that was due un|to
him; &s;o likewi&s;e, &s;hall my heavenly Father do al&s;o un|to
you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
brother their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.&endq; &startq;Put on bowels of mercy, kind|ne&s;s,
humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long &s;uffering,
forbearing one another, forgiving one another, if any
man have a quarrel again&s;t any; even as Chri&s;t forgave
you, &s;o al&s;o do ye.&endq; &startq;Be patient towards all men; &s;ee
that none render evil for evil unto any man.&endq; &startq;Avenge not
your&s;elves but rather give place unto wrath: for it is writ|ten,
vengeance is mine, I will repay &s;aith the Lord.
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, &s;eed him; if he thir&s;t,
give him drink; for in &s;o doing, thou &s;halt heap coals of
<PB N="221" REF="259">
fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but over|come
evil with good.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 14. 15. xviii. 34. 35. Col. iii. 12. 13. The&s;&s;. v. 14. 15. Rom. xii. 19. i.</NOTE></P>
<P>I think it evident from &s;ome of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages taken &s;e|parately,
and &s;till more &s;o, from all of them together,
that revenge as de&s;cribed in the beginning of this chapter,
is forbidden in every degree, under all forms, and upon any
occa&s;ion. We are likewi&s;e forbidden to refu&s;e to an ene|my
even the mo&s;t imperfect right; &startq;if he hunger feed
him, if he thir&s;t give him drink,&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sec al&s;o Exodus xxiii. 4. "If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or his a&s;s, going a&s;tray thou &s;hall &s;urely bring it back to him again: if thou &s;ee the a&s;s of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and woulde&s;t forbear to help him, thou &s;halt &s;urely help with him.</NOTE> which are examples
of imperfect rights. If one who has offended us, &s;olicit
from us a vote to which his qualifications entitle him, we
may not refu&s;e it from motives of re&s;entment, or the me|mory
of what we have &s;uffered at his hands. His right,
and our obligation which follows the right, is not altered
by his enmity to us, or our's to him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I do not conceive, that the&s;e prohi|bitions
were intended to interfere with the puni&s;hment or
pro&s;ecution of public offenders. In the eighteenth chap|ter
of St. Matthew, our Saviour tells his di&s;ciples, &startq;if
thy brother who has tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t thee, neglect to
<PB N="222" REF="260">
hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man,
and a publican.&endq; Immediately after this, when St. Pe|ter
a&s;ked him, &startq;how oft &s;hall my brother &s;in again&s;t me,
and I forgive him?&endq; till &s;even times? Chri&s;t replied, &startq;I
&s;ay not unto thee until &s;even times; but until &s;eventy
times &s;even;&endq; that is as often as he repeats the offence.
From the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages compared together, we are au|thorized
to conclude, that the forgivene&s;s of an enemy,
is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the proceeding again&s;t him as a
public offender; and that the di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed in reli|gious
or civil &s;ocieties, for the re&s;traint or puni&s;hment of
criminals, ought to be upheld.</P>
<P>As the Magi&s;trate is not tied down by the&s;e prohibitions
from the execution of his office, &s;o neither is the pro&s;ecutor;
for the office of the pro&s;ecutor is as nece&s;&s;ary as
that of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Nor by parity of rea&s;on, are private per&s;ons withheld
from the correction of vice, when it is in their pow|er
to exerci&s;e it; by which, &s;ome kinds of vice are
more di&s;couraged and kept in awe, than by legal penal|ties:
provided however they be a&s;&s;ured, that it is the guilt,
which provokes them, and not the injury; and that their
motives are pure from all mixture, and every particle of
that &s;pirit, which delights and triumphs in the pain
and humiliation of an adver&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="261">
Thus it is no breach of chri&s;tian charity, to withdraw
our company or civility, when the &s;ame tends to di&s;coun|tenance
any vicious practice. This is one branch of that
extrajudicial di&s;cipline, which &s;upplies the defects and re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s
of law; and is expre&s;&s;ly authorized by St. Paul
(1 Cor. v. II.) &startq;But now I have written unto you, not to
keep company, if any man, that is called a brother, be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a
drunkard, or an extortioner; with &s;uch an one no not to
eat.&endq; The u&s;e of this continues to be experienced in one
in&s;tance, and might be extended with good effect to others.
The confederacy among&s;t women of character, to exclude
from their &s;ociety, kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and pro&s;titutes, contri|butes
more perhaps to di&s;courage that condition of life,
and prevents more from entering into it, than all the con|&s;iderations
of prudence and religion put together.</P>
<P>We are likewi&s;e allowed to practice &s;o much caution, as
not to put our&s;elves in the way of injury, or invite the re|petition
of it. If a &s;ervant, or trade&s;man has cheated us,
we are not bound to tru&s;t him again; for this is to encou|rage
him in his di&s;hone&s;t practices, which is doing him as
much harm, as it can do us.</P>
<P>Where a benefit can be conferred only upon one or few;
and the choice of the per&s;on, upon whom it is conferred,
is a proper &s;ubject of favour; we are at liberty to prefer
<PB N="224" REF="262">
tho&s;e who have not offended us to tho&s;e who have; the
contrary being no where required.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t who, as hath been well demon&s;trated,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See a view of the internal evidence of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</NOTE> e&s;timated
virtues by their &s;olid utility, and not by their fa&s;hion or po|pularity,
prefers this of the forgivene&s;s of injuries, to every
other. He injoins it oftener; with more earne&s;tne&s;s; un|der
a greater variety of forms; and with this weighty and
peculiar circum&s;tance, that the forgivene&s;s of others is the
condition, upon which alone we are to expect, or even
a&s;k, from God, forgivene&s;s for our&s;elves. And this prefer|ence
is ju&s;tified by the &s;uperior importance of the virtue
it&s;elf. The feuds and animo&s;ities in families and between
neighbours, which di&s;turb the intercour&s;e of human life,
and collectively compo&s;e half the mi&s;ery of it, have their
foundation in the want of a forgiving temper, and can
never cea&s;e, but by the exerci&s;e of this virtue, on one &s;ide,
or both.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Duelling.</HEAD>
<P>DUELLING as a puni&s;hment is ab&s;urd; becau&s;e it is an
equal chance, whether the puni&s;hment fall upon the
offender, or the per&s;on offended. Nor is it much better
as a reparation; it being hard to &s;ay, what <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI>
con&s;i&s;ts in, or how it tends to undo the injury, or afford a
compen&s;ation for the damage already &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The truth is, it is not con&s;idered as either. A law of
honour having annexed the imputation of cowardice to
patience under an affront, challenges are given and accept|ed,
with no other de&s;ign than to prevent or wipe off this
&s;u&s;picion; without malice again&s;t the adver&s;ary, generally
without a wi&s;h to de&s;troy him, or any concern but to
pre&s;erve the duelli&s;t's own reputation and reception in the
world.</P>
<P>The unrea&s;onablene&s;s of this rule of manners is one
con&s;ideration; the duty and conduct of individuals, whil&s;t
&s;uch a rule exi&s;ts, is another.</P>
<P>As to which, the proper and &s;ingle que&s;tion is this,
whether a regard for our own reputation is, or is not &s;uffi|cient
to ju&s;tify the taking away the life of another.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="264">
Murder is forbidden; and wherever human life is delibe|rately
taken away, otherwi&s;e than by public authority,
there is murder. The value and &s;ecurity of human life
make this rule nece&s;&s;ary; for I do not &s;ee what other
idea or definition of murder can be admitted, which will
not let in &s;o much private violence, as to render &s;ociety a
&s;cene of peril and blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>If unauthorized laws of honour be allowed to create ex|captions
to divine prohibitions, there is an end of all mo|rality
as founded in the will of the Deity; and the obli|gation
of every duty, may at one time or other be di&s;|charged,
by the caprice and fluctuations of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>But a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame is &s;o much torture; and no relief
pre&s;ents it&s;elf otherwi&s;e than by an attempt upon the life
of our adver&s;ary. What then? The di&s;tre&s;s which men
&s;uffer by the want of money is oftentimes extreme, and
no re&s;ource can be di&s;covered but that of removing a life,
which &s;tands between the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed per&s;on and his inheri|tance.
The motive in this ca&s;e is as urgent, and the
means much the &s;ame as in the former; yet this ca&s;e
finds no advocates.</P>
<P>Take away the circum&s;tance of the duelli&s;t's expo&s;ing his
own life, and it becomes a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: add this circum&s;tance,
and what difference does it make? none but this, that fewer
perhaps will imitate the example, and human life will be
&s;omewhat more &s;afe, when it cannot be attacked without
<PB N="227" REF="265">
equal danger to the aggre&s;&s;or's own. Experience however
proves that there is fortitude enough in mo&s;t men to under|take
this hazard; and were it otherwi&s;e, the defence, at
be&s;t, would be only that which a highwayman or hou&s;e-breaker
might plead, who&s;e attempt had been &s;o daring
and de&s;perate, that few were likely to repeat the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In expo&s;tulating with the duelli&s;t I all along &s;uppo&s;e his
adver&s;ary to fall. Which &s;uppo&s;ition I am at liberty to
make, becau&s;e, if he have no right to kill his adver&s;ary, he
has none to attempt it.</P>
<P>In return, I forbear applying to the ca&s;e of duelling, the
chri&s;tian principle of the forgivene&s;s of injurles; becau&s;e
the injury may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be forgiven, and the duelli&s;t
to act entirely from a concern for his own reputation:
where this is not the ca&s;e, the guilt of duelling is manife&s;t,
and greater.</P>
<P>In this view it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h, between
him who gives, and him who accepts a challenge; for
they incur an equal hazard of de&s;troying life; and both
act upon the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion, that what they do is nece&s;|&s;ary,
in order to recover or pre&s;erve the good opinion of
the world.</P>
<P>Public opinion is not ea&s;ily controlled by civil in&s;titu|tions;
for which rea&s;on I que&s;tion whether any regulations
can be contrived of &s;ufficient force to &s;uppre&s;s or change
<PB N="228" REF="266">
the rule of honour which &s;tigmati&s;es all &s;cruples about
duelling with the reproach of cowardice.</P>
<P>The inadequate redre&s;s which the law of the land af|fords,
for tho&s;e injuries which chiefly affect a man in his
&s;en&s;ibility and reputation, tempts many to redre&s;s them|&s;elves.
Pro&s;ecutions for &s;uch offences, by the trifling da|mages
that are recovered, &s;erve only to make the &s;ufferer
more ridiculous.&mdash;This ought to be remedied.</P>
<P>For the army, where the point of honour is cultivated
with exqui&s;ite attention and refinement, I would e&s;tabli&s;h
a Court of Honour, with a power of awarding tho&s;e &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions
and acknowledgments, which it is generally the
object of a challenge to obtain; and it might grow into a
fa&s;hion, with per&s;ons of rank of all profe&s;&s;ions, to refer
their quarrels to the &s;ame tribunal.</P>
<P>Duelling, as the law now &s;tands, can &s;eldom be over|taken
by legal puni&s;hment. The challenge, appointment,
and other previous circum&s;tances, which indicate the in|tention
with which the combatants met, being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
nothing <HI>appears</HI> to a court of ju&s;tice, but the actual ren|counter.
And if a per&s;on be &s;lain when actually fighting
with his adver&s;ary, the law deems his death nothing more

of them to require an unre&s;i&s;ting &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every con|tumely,
or a neglect of the means of &s;afety and &s;elf-de|fence.
He took refuge in the laws of his country, and

<P>On the one hand therefore, Chri&s;tianity excludes all
vindictive motives, and all frivolous cau&s;es of pro&s;ecution;
&s;o that, where the injury is &s;mall, where no good purpo&s;e
of public example is an&s;wered, where forbearance is not
likely to invite a repetition of the injury, or where the ex|pence
<PB N="231" REF="269">
of an action becomes a puni&s;hment too &s;evere for
the offence; here the chri&s;tian is withheld by the authority
of his religion from going to law.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a law &s;uit is incon&s;i&s;tent with no

<P>Nor to &s;tifle any in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, although it make
again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have treated of civil actions. In criminal
pro&s;ecutions the private injury &s;hould be forgotten, and

bound to direct their conduct by a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate care for
the public welfare.</P>
<P>In whatever degree the puni&s;hment of an offender is
conducive, or his e&s;cape dangerous to the intere&s;t of the

the crime was committed bound to pro&s;ecute, becau&s;e

and even the exi&s;tence of this &s;ort of kindne&s;s in the world
depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the return it receives,
and this is a con&s;ideration of public importance.</P>
<P>A &s;econd rea&s;on for cultivating a grateful temper in
our&s;elves is the following: the &s;ame principle, which is
<PB N="235" REF="273">
touched with the kindne&s;s of a human benefactor, is ca|pable
of being affected by the divine goodne&s;s, and of be|coming
under the influence of that affection, a &s;ource of the
pure&s;t and mo&s;t exalted virtue. The love of God is the
&s;ublime&s;t gratitude. It is a mi&s;take therefore to imagine,
that this virtue is omitted in the chri&s;tain &s;criptures, for
every precept, which commands us &startq;to love God, be|cau&s;e
he fir&s;t loved us,&endq; pre&s;uppo&s;es the principle of gra|titude,
and directs it to its proper object.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to particulari&s;e the &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions
of gratitude, which vary with the character and &s;ituation
of the benefactor, and with the opportunities of the per|&s;on
obliged; for this variety admits of no de&s;cription.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved however, that gratitude can never
oblige a man to do what is wrong, and what by con&s;e|quence
he is previou&s;ly obliged not to do. It is no ingra|titude
to refu&s;e to do, what we cannot reconcile to any ap|prehen&s;ions
of our duty; but it is ingratitude and hypo|cri&s;y
together, to pretend this rea&s;on, when it is not the
real one: and the frequency of &s;uch pretences has brought
this apology for noncompliance with the will of a bene|factor
into unmerited di&s;grace.</P>
<P>It has long been accounted a violation of delicacy and
genero&s;ity to upbraid men with the favours they have re|ceived;
but it argues a total de&s;titution of both the&s;e qua|lities
<PB N="236" REF="274">
as well as of moral probity, to take advantage of
that a&s;cendency, which the conferring of benefits ju&s;tly
creates, to draw or drive tho&s;e whom we have obliged
into mean or di&s;hone&s;t compliances.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slander.</HEAD>
<P>SPEAKING is acting, both in philo&s;ophical &s;trictne&s;s,
and as to all moral purpo&s;es; for, if the mi&s;chief and
motive of our conduct be the &s;ame, the means we u&s;e
make no difference.</P>
<P>And this is in effect what our Saviour declares, <HI>Matt.</HI>
xii. 37. &startq;By thy words thou &s;halt be ju&s;tified, and by
thy words thou &s;halt be condemned:&endq; by thy words, as
well that is as by thy actions; the one &s;hall be taken in|to
the account, as well as the other, for they both po&s;&s;e&s;s
the &s;ame property of voluntarily producing good or evil.</P>
<P>Slander may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds, <HI>malicious</HI>
&s;lander, and <HI>incon&s;iderate</HI> &s;lander.</P>
<P><HI>Malicious</HI> &s;lander, is the relating of either truth or fals|hood,
with a con&s;cious purpo&s;e of creating mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="275">
I acknowledge that the truth or fal&s;hood of what is re|lated
varies the degree of guilt con&s;iderably; and that
&s;lander, in, the ordinary acceptation of the term, &s;ignifies
the circulation of mi&s;chievous fal&s;ehoods; but truth may
be made in&s;trumental to the &s;ucce&s;s of malicious de&s;igns
as well as fal&s;hood, and altho' the end may &s;ometimes
ju&s;tify the means, the means can never ju&s;tify the end.</P>
<P>I think the idea of &s;lander ought to be confined to the
production of <HI>gratuitous</HI> mi&s;chief. When we have an end
or intere&s;t of our own to &s;erve, if we attempt to compa&s;s
it
by fal&s;hood, it is <HI>fraud;</HI> if by a di&s;covery of the truth, it
is not without &s;ome additional, circum&s;tance of breach of
promi&s;e, betraying of confidence, or the like, to be deemed
criminal.</P>
<P>Sometimes the pain is intended for the per&s;on we &s;peak
to; at other times an enmity is to be gratified by the
prejudice or di&s;quiet of a third per&s;on. To infu&s;e &s;u&s;|picions;
to kindle or continue di&s;putes; to avert the fa|vour
and e&s;teem of benefactors from their dependents; to
render &s;ome one we di&s;like contemptible or obnoxious in
the public opinion; are all offices of &s;lander; of which
the guilt mu&s;t be mea&s;ured by the inten&s;ity and extent
of
the mi&s;ery produced.</P>
<P>The di&s;gui&s;es under which &s;lander is conveyed, whe|ther
in a whi&s;per, with injunctions of &s;ecre&s;y, by way of
caution, or with affected reluctance, are all &s;o many ag|gravations
of the offence, as they manife&s;t a more con|certed
and deliberate de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="276">
<HI>Incon&s;iderate</HI> &s;lander is a different offence. The not be|ing
con&s;cious of that mi&s;chievous de&s;ign, which we have
hitherto attributed to the &s;landerer, makes the difference;
altho' the &s;ame mi&s;chief actually follow, and might have
been for&s;een.</P>
<P>The guilt here con&s;i&s;ts in the want of that regard to
the con&s;equences of our conduct, which a ju&s;t affection
for human happine&s;s, and concern for our duty, would
not have failed to produce in us. And it is no an&s;wer to
this crimination to &s;ay that we entertain no bad <HI>de&s;ign.</HI>
A &s;ervant may be a very bad &s;ervant, and yet &s;eldom or
never <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to act in oppo&s;ition to his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t or
will; and his ma&s;ter may ju&s;tly puni&s;h &s;uch &s;ervant for
a thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and neglect nearly as prejudicial as de|liberate
di&s;obedience. I accu&s;e you not, he may &s;ay, of
any expre&s;s intention to hurt me; but had not the fear
of my di&s;plea&s;ure, the care of my intere&s;t, and indeed all
the qualities which constitute the merit of a good $ervant,
been wanting in you, they would not only have excluded
every direct purpo&s;e of giving me unea&s;ine&s;s, but have
been &s;o far pre&s;ent to your thoughts, as to have checked
that unguarded licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by which I have &s;uffered &s;o
much, and in&s;pired you in its place, with an habitual &s;o|licitude
about the effects and tendency of what you did
or &s;aid. This very much re&s;embles the ca&s;e of all &s;ins

that of incon&s;iderate &s;lander.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fornication.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and great mi&s;chief, and by con&s;equence
the guilt, of promi&s;cuous concubinage, con&s;i&s;ts in its
tendency to dimini&s;h marriages; and thereby to defeat the
&s;everal public and beneficial purpo&s;es enumerated in the
preceeding chapter.</P>
<P>Promi&s;cuous concubinage di&s;courages marriage by aba|ting
the chief temptation to it. The male part of the
&s;pecies will not undertake the incumbrance, expence, and
re&s;traint of married life, if they can gratify their pa&s;&s;ions
at a cheaper price; and they will undertake any thing, ra|ther
than not gratify them.</P>
<P>The reader will learn to comprehend the magnitude of
this mi&s;chief, by attending to the importance and variety
of the u&s;es to which marriage is &s;ub&s;ervient; and by re|collecting
withal, that the malignity and moral quality
of each crime is not to be estimated by the particular ef|fect
of one offence, or of one per&s;on's offending, but by
the general tendency and con&s;equence of crimes of the
&s;ame nature. The libertine may not be con&s;cious that
<PB N="244" REF="282">
his indulgences in this way hinder his own marriage, from
which he is deterred, he may alledge, by many different
con&s;iderations; much le&s;s does he perceive how <HI>his</HI> indul|gences
can hinder other men from marrying; but what,
will he &s;ay, would be the con&s;equence, if the &s;ame licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s
were univer&s;al? or what &s;hould hinder its be|coming
univer&s;al, if it be innocent or allowable in him?</P>
<P>2. Fornication &s;uppo&s;es pro&s;titution; and pro&s;titution
brings and leaves the victims of it, to almo&s;t certain mi|&s;ery.
It is no &s;mall quantity of mi&s;ery in the aggregate,
which, between want, di&s;ea&s;e, and in&s;ult, is &s;uffered by
tho&s;e outca&s;ts of human &s;ociety, who infe&s;t populous ci|ties;
the whole of which, is a <HI>general con&s;equence</HI> of for|nication,
and to the increa&s;e and continuance of which,
every act and in&s;tance of fornication contributes.</P>
<P>3. Fornication produces habits of ungovernable lewd|ne&s;s,
which introduce the more aggravated crimes of &s;e|duction,
adultery, violation, &amp;c. Likewi&s;e, however it
be accounted for, the criminal commerce of the &s;exes cor|rupts
and depraves the mind and moral character more,
than any &s;ingle &s;pecies of vice what&s;oever. That ready per|ception
of guilt, and deci&s;ive re&s;olution again&s;t it, which
con&s;titute a virtuous character, are &s;eldom found in the per|&s;ons
addicted to the&s;e indulgences. They prepare an ea&s;y
admi&s;&s;ion for every &s;in that &s;eeks it; and are in low life,
u&s;ually the fir&s;t &s;tage in men's progre&s;s to the mo&s;t de&s;pe|rate
villainies; and in high life, to that lamented di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s
<PB N="245" REF="283">
of principle, which manife&s;ts it&s;elf in a profligacy of
public conduct, and a contempt of the obligations of reli|gion
and moral probity. Add to this, that habits of liber|tini&s;m
incapacitate and indi&s;po&s;e the mind for all intellec|tual,
moral, and religious plea&s;ures, which is a great lo&s;s
to any man's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>4. Fornication perpetuates a di&s;ea&s;e, which may be ac|counted
one of the fore&s;t maladies of human nature; and
the effects of which are &s;aid to vi&s;it the con&s;titution of
even di&s;tant generations.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion being natural proves that it was intended to
be gratified; but under what re&s;trictions, or whether
without any, mu&s;t be collected from different con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian &s;criptures condemn fornication absolutely
and peremptorily. &startq;Out of the heart,&endq; &s;ays our Saviour,
&startq;proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, <HI>fornication,</HI>
thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies, the&s;e are the things
which defile a man.&endq; The&s;e are Chri&s;t's own words, and
one word from him upon the &s;ubject is final. It may be
ob&s;erved with what &s;ociety fornication is cla&s;&s;ed; with
murders, thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies. I do not mean
that the&s;e crimes are all equal, becau&s;e they are all men|tioned
together; but it proves that they are all, crimes.
The apo&s;tles are more full upon this topic. One well
known pa&s;&s;age in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews may &s;tand in
<PB N="246" REF="284">
the place of all others; becau&s;e admitting the authority by
which the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t &s;pake and wrote, it is de|cisive:
&startq;Marriage and the bed undefiled is honourable
among&s;t all men, but whoremongers and adulterers God
will judge;&endq; which was a great deal to &s;ay, at a time
when it was not agreed even among&s;t philo&s;ophers, that
fornication was a crime.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures give no &s;anction to tho&s;e au&s;terities,
which have been &s;ince impo&s;ed upon the world under the
name of Chri&s;t's religion, as the celibacy of the clergy,
the prai&s;e of perpetual virginity, the <HI>prohibitio concubit&ucirc;s cum
gravid&acirc; uxore;</HI> but with a ju&s;t knowledge of, and regard
to the condition and intere&s;t of the human &s;pecies, have
provided in the marriage of one man with one woman, an
adequate gratification, for the propen&s;ities of their nature,
and have <HI>re&s;trained</HI> them to that gratification.</P>
<P>The avowed toleration, and in &s;ome countries the li|cen&s;ing,
taxing, and regulating of public brothels, has ap|peared
to the people an authorizing of fornication, and
has contributed with other cau&s;es, &s;o far to vitiate the
public opinion, that there is no practice of which the im|morality
is &s;o little thought of, or acknowledged; altho'
there are few, in which it can more plainly be made out.
The legi&s;lators who have patronized receptacles of prosti|tution,
ought to have fore&s;een this effect, as well as con|&s;idered,
that whatever facilitates fornication, dimini&s;hes
marriages. And as to the u&s;ual apology for this relaxed
<PB N="247" REF="285">
decipline, the danger of greater enormities, if acce&s;s to
pro&s;titutes were too &s;trictly watched and prohibited, it will
be time enough to look to that, after the laws and the ma|gi&s;trates
have done their utmo&s;t. The greate&s;t vigilance
of both, will do no more, than oppo&s;e &s;ome bounds and
&s;ome difficulties to this intercour&s;e. And after all, the&s;e
pretended fears are without foundation in experience. The
men are in all re&s;pects the mo&s;t virtuous, in countries,
where the women are mo&s;t cha&s;te.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecies of cohabitation, di&s;tingui&s;hable no
doubt from promi&s;cuous concubinage, and which by rea|&s;on
of its re&s;emblance to marriage may be thought to par|ticipate
of the &s;anctity and innocence of that e&s;tate; I
mean the ca&s;e of <HI>kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> under the favourable cir|cum&s;tance
of mutual fidelity. This ca&s;e I have heard de|fended
by &s;ome &s;uch apology as the following.</P>
<P>&startq;That the marriage rite being different, in different
countries, and in the &s;ame country among&s;t different &s;ects,
and with &s;ome, &s;carce any thing; and moreover not being
pre&s;cribed or even mentioned in &s;cripture, can be ac|counted
of only as of a form and ceremony of human in|vention:
that con&s;equently, if a man and woman betroth
and confine them&s;elves to each other, their intercour&s;e
mu&s;t be the &s;ame as to all moral purpo&s;es, as if they were
legally married; for the addition or omi&s;&s;ion of a mere
form and ceremony can make no difference in the fight of
God, or in the actual nature of right and wrong.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="286">
To all which it may be replied,</P>
<P>1. If the &s;ituation of the parties be the &s;ame thing as
marriage, why do they not marry?</P>
<P>2. If the man chu&s;e to have it in his power to di&s;mi&s;s
the woman at his plea&s;ure, or to retain her in a &s;tate of
hu|miliation
or dependence incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights which
marriage would confer upon her, it is not the &s;ame
thing.</P>
<P>3. It is not at any rate the &s;ame thing to the children.</P>
<P>Again, as to the marriage rite being a mere form, and
that too, variable, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of &s;igning and
&s;ealing of bonds, wills, deeds of conveyance, and the like,
which yet make a great difference in the rights and obli|gations
of the parties concerned in them.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the rite not being appointed in
&s;cripture&mdash;the &s;criptures forbid fornication, that is cohabi|tation
without marriage, leaving it to the law of each
country to pronounce what is, or what makes a marriage,
in like manner as they forbid theft, that is the taking
away of another's property, leaving it to the municipal
law to fix what makes the thing property, or who&s;e it is,
which al&s;o, like marriage, depends on arbitrary and mu|table
forms.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="287">
Laying a&s;ide the injunctions of &s;cripture, the plain ac|count
of the que&s;tion &s;eems to be this: it is immo|ral,
becau&s;e it is pernicious, that men and women &s;hould co|habit
without undertaking certain irrevocable obligations
and mutually conferring certain civil rights; if therefore
the law has annexed the&s;e rights and obligations to cer|tain
forms, &s;o that they cannot be &s;ecured or undertaken
otherwi&s;e, which is the ca&s;e here (for whatever the par|ties
may promi&s;e to each other, nothing but the marriage
ceremony can make their promi&s;e irrevocable) it becomes
in the &s;ame degree immoral, that men and women &s;hould
cohabit without the interpo&s;ition of the&s;e forms.</P>
<P>If fornication be criminal, all tho&s;e incentives which
lead to it are acce&s;&s;aries to the crime, as la&s;civious conver|&s;ation,
whether expre&s;&s;ed in ob&s;cene or di&s;gui&s;ed under
mode&s;t phra&s;es, al&s;o wanton &s;ongs, pictures, books, the
writing publi&s;hing and circulating of which, whether out
of frolic, or for &s;ome pitiful profit, is productive of &s;o ex|ten&s;ive
a mi&s;chief from &s;o mean a temptation, that few
crimes, within the reach of private wickedne&s;s, have more
to an&s;wer for, or le&s;s to plead in their excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Indecent conver&s;ation, and by parity of rea&s;on all the
re&s;t, are forbidden by St. Paul, Eph. iv. 29. &startq;Let no cor|rupt

this barbarity, with their pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for their off-&s;pring,
in other ca&s;es. Nothing but an agony of mind the
mo&s;t in&s;upportable can induce a woman to forget her na|ture,
and the pity, which even a &s;tranger would &s;how, to a
helple&s;s and imploring infant. It is true, that all are not
urged to this extremity, but if any are, it affords an indi|cation
of how much all &s;uffer, from the &s;ame cau&s;e.
What &s;hall we &s;ay to the authors of &s;uch mi&s;chief?</P>
<P>The <HI>lo&s;s</HI> which a woman &s;u&s;tains by the ruin of her re|putation,
almo&s;t exceeds computation. Every per&s;on's hap|pine&s;s
depends in part upon the re&s;pect and reception they
meet with in the world; and it is no incon&s;iderable morti|fication
even to the firme&s;t tempers to be rejected from the
&s;ociety of their equals, or received there with neglect and
di&s;dain. But this is not all, nor the wor&s;t. By a rule of
life, which it is not ea&s;y to blame, and impo&s;&s;ible to alter,
a woman lo&s;es with her cha&s;tity the chance of marrying
<PB N="252" REF="290">
at all, or in any manner equal to the hopes &s;he had been
accu&s;tomed to entertain. Now marriage, whatever it be
to a man, is that, from which every woman expects her
chief happine&s;s. And this is &s;till more true in low life, of
which condition the women are, who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to
&s;olicitations of this &s;ort. Add to this, that where a wo|man's
maintenance depends upon her character, as it does,
in a great mea&s;ure, with tho&s;e who are to &s;upport them|&s;elves
by &s;ervice, little &s;ometimes is left to the for&s;aken
&s;ufferer, but to &s;tarve for want of employment, or to have
recour&s;e to pro&s;titution for food and raiment.</P>
<P>As a woman collects her virtue into this point, the lo&s;s
of her cha&s;tity is generally the <HI>de&s;truction of her moral prin|ciple;</HI>
and this con&s;equence is to be apprehended, whether
the criminal intercour&s;e be di&s;covered or not.</P>
<P>2. The injury to the family may be under&s;tood, by the
application of that infallible rule &startq;of doing to others what
we would that others &s;hould do unto us.&endq; Let a father,
or a brother &s;ay, for what they would &s;uffer this injury
in a daughter or a &s;i&s;ter; and whether any or even a total
lo&s;s of fortune, would create equal affliction and di&s;tre&s;s.
And when they reflect upon this, let them di&s;tingui&s;h if
they can, between the robbery of their fortune by fraud
or forgery, and the ruin of their happine&s;s by the treachery
of a Seducer.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="291">
3. The public at large lo&s;e the benefit of the woman's
&s;ervice in her proper place and de&s;tination, as a wife and
parent. This to the whole community may be little; but
it is often more than all the good, which the &s;educer does
to the community, can recompen&s;e. Moreover, pro&s;titution
is &s;upplied by &s;eduction, and in proportion to the dan|ger
there is of the woman's betaking her&s;elf after her fir&s;t
&s;acrifice to a life of public lewdne&s;s, the &s;educer is an&s;wer|able
for the multiplied evils to which his crime gives
birth.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if we pur&s;ue the effects of &s;eduction,
through the complicated mi&s;ery it occa&s;ions; and if it be

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Adultery.</HEAD>
<P>A New &s;ufferer is introduced, the injured hu&s;band,
who receives a wound in his &s;en&s;ibility and affec|tions,
the mo&s;t painful and incurable that human nature
knows. In all other re&s;pects, adultery on the part of the
man who &s;olicits the cha&s;tity of a married woman, includes
the crime of &s;eduction, and is attended with the &s;ame
mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The infidelity of the woman is aggravated, by the cru|elty
to her children, who are generally involved in their
parents &s;hame, and always made unhappy by their
quarrel.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the&s;e con&s;equences are chargeable not
&s;o much upon the crime, as the di&s;covery, we an&s;wer,
fir&s;t, that the crime could not be di&s;covered unle&s;s it were
committed, and that the commi&s;&s;ion is never &s;ecure from
di&s;covery; and &s;econdly, that if we allow of adulterous
connections, whenever they can hope to e&s;cape detection,
which is the conclu&s;ion to which this argument conducts
<PB N="255" REF="293">
us, we leave the hu&s;band no other &s;ecurity for his wife's
cha&s;tity, than in her want of opportunity or temptation,
which would probably deter mo&s;t men from marrying, or
render marriage, a &s;tate of jealou&s;y and continual alarm to
the hu&s;band; which mu&s;t end, in the &s;lavery and confine|ment
of the wife.</P>
<P>The vow, by which married per&s;ons mutually engage
their fidelity is &startq;witne&s;&s;ed before God,&endq; and accompanied
with circumstances of &s;olemnity and religion, which ap|proach
to the nature of an oath. The married offender
therefore incurs a crime little &s;hort of perjury, and the &s;e|duction
of a married woman is little le&s;s than &s;ubornation
of perjury&mdash;and this guilt is independent of the
di&s;covery.</P>
<P>All behaviour, which is de&s;igned, or which knowingly
tends, to captivate the affection of a married woman, is a
barbarous intru&s;ion upon the peace and virtue of a family,
though it fall &s;hort of adultery.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual and only apology for adultery is the prior
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the other party. There are degrees no
doubt in this, as in other crimes; and &s;o far as the bad
effects of adultery are anticipated by the conduct of the
hu&s;band or wife who offends fir&s;t, the guilt of the &s;econd
offender is extenuated. But this can never amount to a
ju&s;tification; unle&s;s it could be &s;hewn that the obligation
of the marriage vow depends upon the condition of reci|procal
<PB N="256" REF="294">
fidelity; for which con&s;truction, there appears no
foundation, either in expediency, or in the terms of the
promi&s;e, or in the de&s;ign of the legi&s;lature which pre&s;cribed
the marriage rite. Moreover, the rule contended for by
this plea, has a manife&s;t tendency to multiply the offence,
but none, to reclaim the offender.</P>
<P>The way of con&s;idering the offence of one party as a
<HI>provocation</HI> to the other, and the other as only <HI>retaliating</HI>
the injury by repeating the crime, is a childi&s;h trifling
with words.</P>
<P>&startq;Thou &s;halt not commit adultery,&endq; was an interdict
delivered by God him&s;elf. By the Jewi&s;h law adultery
was capital to both parties in the crime; &startq;Even he that
committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adul|terer
and adultere&s;s &s;hall &s;urely be put to death,&endq; Lev. xx.
10. which proves, that the divine legi&s;lator placed a great
difference between adultery and fornication: and with
this agree the chri&s;tian &s;criptures, for in almo&s;t all the ca|talogues
they have left us of crimes, and criminals, they
enumerate &startq;fornication, adultery,&endq; &startq;whoremongers, adul|terers,&endq;
(Matt. xv. 19. 1 Cor. vi. 9. Gal. v. 9. Heb. xiii. 4.)
by which mention of both, they &s;hew that they did not
con&s;ider them as the &s;ame; but that the crime of adul|tery
was, in their apprehen&s;ion, di&s;tinct from, and accu|mulated
upon that of fornication.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="295">
The hi&s;tory of the woman taken in adultery, recorded
in the eighth chapter of <HI>St. John's Go&s;pel,</HI> has been thought
by &s;ome to give countenance to that crime. As Chri&s;t
told the woman, &startq;neither do <HI>I condemn</HI> thee,&endq; we mu&s;t
believe, it is &s;aid, that he deemed her conduct either not
criminal, or not a crime however of the heinous nature
we repre&s;ent it to be. A more attentive examination of
the ca&s;e will, I think, convince us, that nothing can be
concluded from it, as to Chri&s;t's opinion concerning adul|tery,
either one way or the other. The tran&s;action is thus
related. &startq;Early in the morning Je&s;us came again into
the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he
&s;at down and taught them; and the Scribes and Phari&s;ees
brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when
they had &s;et her in the mid&s;t, they &s;ay unto him, Ma&s;ter
this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act; now
Mo&s;es in the law commanded that &s;uch &s;hould be &s;toned,
but what &s;aye&s;t thou? This they &s;aid tempting him, that
they might have to accu&s;e him: but Je&s;us-&s;tooped down,
and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he
heard them not. So when they continued asking him,
he lift up him&s;elf, and &s;aid unto them, he that is without
&s;in among&s;t you, let him fir&s;t ca&s;t a &s;tone at her; and
again he &s;tooped down and wrote on the ground: and
they which heard it, being convicted by their own con|&s;cience,
went out one by one, beginning at the elde&s;t, even
unto the la&s;t; and Je&s;us was left alone, and the woman
&s;tanding in the mid&s;t. When Je&s;us had lift up him&s;elf,
and &s;aw none but the woman, he &s;aid unto her, woman
<PB N="258" REF="296">
where are tho&s;e thine accu&s;ers? hath no man condemned
thee? She &s;aid unto him, no man, Lord; and, he &s;aid unto
her, <HI>neither do I condemn thee,</HI> go and &s;in no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This they &s;aid tempting him that they might have to
accu&s;e him,&endq; to draw him, that is, into an exerci&s;e of ju|dicial
authority, that they might have to accu&s;e him be|fore
the Roman governor of u&s;urping or intermeddling
with the civil government. This was their de&s;ign, and
Chri&s;t's behaviour throughout the whole affair proceeded
from a knowledge of this de&s;ign, and his care to defeat it.
He gives them at fir&s;t a cold and &s;ullen reception, well &s;uited
to the in&s;idious intention with which they came, &startq;he
&s;tooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground,
as though he heard them not.&endq; &startq;When they <HI>continued</HI>
asking him,&endq; when they tea&s;ed him to &s;peak, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
them, with a rebuke, which the impertinent malice of
their errand, as well as the &s;ecret character of many of
them de&s;erved, &startq;he that is without &s;in (that is this &s;in)
among you, let him fir&s;t ca&s;t a &s;tone at her.&endq; This had its
effect. Stung with the reproof, and di&s;appointed of their
aim, they &s;tole away one by one and left Je&s;us and the
woman alone. And then follows the conver&s;ation, which
is the part of the narrative mo&s;t material to our pre&s;ent
&s;ubject. &startq;Je&s;us &s;aith unto her, woman where are tho&s;e
thine accu&s;ers? hath no man condemned thee? She &s;aid
no man, Lord. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, neither do I con|demn
thee; go and &s;in no more.&endq; Now, when Chri&s;t
<PB N="259" REF="297">
a&s;ked the woman &startq;hath no man <HI>condemned</HI> thee&endq; he cer|tainly
&s;poke, and was understood by the woman to &s;peak,
of a legal and judicial condemnation; otherwi&s;e her an|&s;wer
&startq;no man, Lord&endq; was not true. In every other
&s;en&s;e of condemnation, as blame, cen&s;ure, reproof, private
judgment, and the like, many had condemned her; all
tho&s;e indeed who brought her to Je&s;us. If then a judi|cial
&s;entence was what Chri&s;t meant by <HI>condemning</HI>
in the que&s;tion, the common u&s;e of language requires us
to &s;uppo&s;e that he meant the &s;ame in his reply, &startq;neither
do I condemn thee,&endq; <HI>i. e.</HI> I pretend to no judicial charac|ter
or authority over thee, it is no office or bu&s;ine&s;s of
mine to pronounce or execute the &s;entence of the law.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t adds &startq;go and &s;in no more&endq; he in effect
tells her, that &s;he had &s;inned already, but as to the degree
or quality of the &s;in, or Chri&s;t's opinion concerning, it, no|thing
is declared, or can be inferred, either way.</P>
<P>Adultery, which was puni&s;hed with death during the
u&s;urpation, is now regarded by the law of England as only
a civil injury; for which the imperfect &s;atisfaction that
money can afford, may be recovered, by the hu&s;band.</P>

tendency to diffu&s;e wealth, connect families, or promote
&s;ome political advantage.</P>

which di&s;&s;olves the vigour of their intellectual as well as
active faculties, producing that indolence and imbecility
both of mind and body, which have long characterized the
nations of the Ea&s;t&mdash;the aba&s;ement of one half of the hu|man

which it has been thought to promote, the community
gain nothing<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nothing, I mean, compared with a &s;tate in which marriage is nearly univer&s;al. Where marriages are le&s;s general, and many women unfruitful from the want of hu&s;bands, polygamy might at fir&s;t add a little to population; and but a little: for as a variety of wives would be &s;ought chiefly from temptations of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, would rather increa&s;e the demand for female beauty, than for the &s;ex at large. And this <HI>little</HI> would &s;oon be made le&s;s, by many deductions. For fir&s;tly, as none but the opulent can maintain a plurality of wives, where polygamy obtains, the rich indulge in it, whil&s;t the re&s;t take up with a vague and barren incontinency. And &s;econdly, women would grow le&s;s jealous of their virtue, when they had nothing for which to re&s;erve it, but a chamber in the <HI>Haram;</HI> when their cha&s;tity was no longer to be rewarded with the rights and happine&s;s of a wife, as enjoyed under the marriage of one woman to one man. The&s;e con&s;iderations may be added to what is mentioned in the text, concerning the ea&s;y and early &s;ettlement of children in the world.</NOTE>; for the que&s;tion is, not, whether one man

power of reforming the laws, have been unwilling to re|&s;ign
their own gratifications. Polygamy is retained at this
day among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and throughout every part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
in which Chri&s;tianity is not pofe&s;&s;ed. In Chri&s;tian coun|tries
it is univer&s;ally prohibited. In <HI>Sweden</HI> it is puni&s;hed
with death. In <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ide the nullity of the &s;econd
marriage, it &s;ubjects the offender to impri&s;onment and
branding for the fir&s;t offence, and to capital puni&s;hment
for the &s;econd. And whatever may be &s;aid in behalf of
polygamy, when it is authori&s;ed by the law of the land,
the marriage of a &s;econd wife, during the life-time of the
fir&s;t, in countries where &s;uch a &s;econd marriage is void,
mu&s;t be ranked with the mo&s;t dangerous and cruel of tho&s;e
frauds, by which a woman is cheated out of her fortune,
her per&s;on, and her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Medes</HI> compelled their citizens, in one can|ton,
to take &s;even wives; in another, each woman to re|ceive
five hu&s;bands: according as war had made, in one
quarter of their country, an extraordinary havock among
the men, or the women had been carried away by an ene|my
from another. This regulation, &s;o far as it was adapted
to the proportion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the numbers
of males and females, was founded in the rea&s;on upon

<P>BY <HI>Divorce,</HI> I mean, the di&s;&s;olution of the marriage
contract, by the act, and at the will, of the husband.</P>
<P>This power was allowed to the hu&s;band, among the
<HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and latter <HI>Romans;</HI> and is at this day
exerci&s;ed by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>The congruity of &s;uch a right with the law of nature,
is the que&s;tion before us.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place, it is manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with
the duty, which the parents owe to their children; which
duty can never be &s;o well fulfilled as by their cohabitation
<PB N="268" REF="306">
and united care. It is al&s;o incompatible with the right which
the mother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as well as the father, to the grati|tude
of her children and the comfort of their &s;ociety;
from both which, &s;he is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily precluded, by
her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from her hu&s;band's family.</P>
<P>Where this objection does not interfere, I know of no
principle of the law of nature applicable to the que&s;tion,
be&s;ides that of general expediency.</P>
<P>For, if we &s;ay, that arbitrary divorces are excluded by
the terms of the marriage contract, it may be an&s;wered,
that the contract might be framed &s;o as to admit of this
condition.</P>
<P>If we argue with &s;ome Morali&s;ts, that the obligation
of a contract naturally continues, &s;o long as the purpo&s;e,
which the contracting parties had in view, requires its con|tinuance,
it will be hard to &s;ay, what purpo&s;e of the con|tract
(the care of children excepted) &s;hould confine a man
to a woman, from whom he &s;eeks to be loo&s;e.</P>
<P>If we contend with others, that a contract cannot, by
the law of nature, be di&s;&s;olved, unle&s;s the parties be re|placed
in the &s;ituation, which each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before the con|tract
was entered into; we &s;hall find it difficult to prove
this to be an univer&s;al or indi&s;pen&s;able property of con|tracts.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="307">
I confes&s; my&s;elf unable: to a&s;&s;ign any circum&s;tance in the
marriage contract, which e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hes it from
other contracts, or which proves that it contains, what
many have a&s;cribed to it, a natural incapacity of being
di&s;&s;olved by the con&s;ent of the parties; at the option of
one of them, or either of them. But if we trace the
effects of &s;uch a rule upon the general happine&s;s of mar|ried
life, we &s;hall perceive rea&s;ons of expediency, that
abundantly ju&s;tify the policy of tho&s;e laws, which refu&s;e
to the hu&s;band the power of divorce, or re&s;train it to a
few extreme and &s;pecific provocations: and our principles
teach us to pronounce that to be contrary to the law of
nature, which can be proved to be detrimental to the com|mon
happine&s;s of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>A lawgiver, who&s;e coun&s;els were directed by views of
general utility, and ob&s;tructed by no local impediment,
would make the marriage contract indi&s;&s;oluble, during the
joint lives of the parties, for the &s;ake of the following ad|vantages.</P>
<P>I. Becau&s;e this tends to pre&s;erve peace and concord be|tween
married per&s;ons, by perpetuating their common
intere&s;t, and by inducing a nece&s;&s;ity of mutual compli|ance.</P>
<P>There is great weight and &s;ub&s;tance in both the&s;e con|&s;iderations.
An earlier termination of the union would
produce a &s;eparate intere&s;t. The wife would naturally
<PB N="270" REF="308">
look forward to the di&s;&s;olution of the partner&s;hip, and en|deavour
to draw to her&s;elf a fund, again&s;t the time when
&s;he was no longer to have acce&s;s to the &s;ame re&s;ources.
This would beget peculation on one &s;ide, and mi&s;tru&s;t on
the other: evils which at pre&s;ent very little di&s;turb the
confidence of married life. The &s;econd effect, of making
the union determinable only by death, is not le&s;s benefi|cial.
Adver&s;e tempers, habits, and ta&s;tes, mu&s;t often meet
in marriage. In which ca&s;e, each party mu&s;t take pains
to give up what offends, and practi&s;e what may gratify the
other. A man and woman in love with each other, do this
in&s;en&s;ibly: but love, is neither general nor durable; and
where that is wanting, no le&s;&s;ons of duty, or delicacy of
&s;entiment, will go half &s;o far with the generality of man|kind
and womankind, as this one intelligible reflection,
that they mu&s;t each make the be&s;t of their bargain; and
that &s;eeing they mu&s;t either both be mi&s;erable, or both
&s;hare in the &s;ame happine&s;s, neither can find their own
comfort but in promoting the plea&s;ure of the other. The&s;e
compliances, though at fir&s;t extorted by nece&s;&s;ity, become
in time ea&s;y and mutual; and, though le&s;s endearing,
than a&s;&s;iduities which take their ri&s;e from affection, gene|rally
procure to this married pair, a repo&s;e and &s;atisfaction,
&s;ufficient for their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>II. Becau&s;e new objects of desire would be continually,
&s;ought after, and preferred, if men could, at will, be re|lea&s;ed
from their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting engagements. Suppo&s;e the
hu&s;band to have once preferred his wife to all other women,
the duration of this preference cannot be tru&s;ted to. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="271" REF="309">
makes a great difference: and there is no other &s;e|curity
again&s;t the invitations of novelty, than the known
impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining the new object. Did the cau&s;e,
which brings the different &s;exes together, hold them to|gether
by the &s;ame force with which it fir&s;t attracted them
to each other, or could the woman be re&s;tored to her per|&s;onal
integrity, and to all the advantages of her virgin
e&s;tate; the power of divorce might be depo&s;ited in the
hands of the hu&s;band, with le&s;s danger of abu&s;e or in|conveniency.
But con&s;tituted as mankind are, and in|jured
as the repudiated wife generally mu&s;t be, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to add a &s;tability to the condition of married women,
more &s;ecure than the continuance of their hu&s;band's af|fections;
and to &s;upply to both &s;ides, by a &s;en&s;e of duty
and of obligation, what &s;atiety has impaired of pa&s;&s;ion and
of per&s;onal attachment. Upon the whole, the power of
divorce is evidently and greatly to the di&s;advantage of the
woman; and the only que&s;tion appears to be, whether the
real or permanent happine&s;s of one half of the &s;pecies, &s;hould be &s;urrendered to the caprice and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of
the other?</P>
<P>We have con&s;idered divorces as depending upon the will
of the hu&s;band, becau&s;e that is the way in which they have
actually obtained in many parts of the world; but the &s;ame
objections apply, in a great degree, to divorces by mutual
con&s;ent; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the indelicate &s;itua|tion
and &s;mall pro&s;pect of happine&s;s, which remains to the
<PB N="272" REF="310">
party, who oppo&s;ed his or her di&s;&s;ent to the liberty and
de&s;ires of the other.</P>
<P>The law of nature admits of an exception, in favour of
the injured party, in ca&s;es of adultery, of ob&s;tinate de&s;er|tion,
of attempts upon life, of outrageous cruelty, of in|curable
madne&s;s, and, perhaps, of per&s;onal imbecillity;
but by no means indulges the &s;ame privilege to mere di&s;|like,
to oppo&s;ition of humours and inclinations, to con|trariety
of ta&s;te and temper, to complaints of coldne&s;s, ne|glect,
&s;everity, peevi&s;hne&s;s, jealou&s;y: not that the&s;e rea|&s;ons
are trivial, but becau&s;e &s;uch objections may always be
alledged, and are impo&s;&s;ible by te&s;timony to be a&s;cer|tained:
&s;o that to allow implicit credit to them, and to
di&s;&s;olve marriages whenever either party thought fit to
pretend them, would lead in its effect to all the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s
of arbitrary divorces.</P>
<P><HI>Milton</HI>'s &s;tory is well known. Upon a quarrel with his
wife, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to another woman, and &s;et
forth a public vindication of his conduct, by attempting to
prove, that confirmed di&s;like was as ju&s;t a foundation for
di&s;&s;olving the marriage contract, as adultery; to which
po&s;ition, and to all the arguments by which it can be &s;up|ported,
the above con&s;ideration affords a &s;ufficient an&s;wer.
And if a married pair, in actual and irreconcileable di&s;cord,
complain that their happine&s;s would be better con&s;ulted,
by permitting them to determine a connection, which is
become odious to both, It may be told them, that the
<PB N="273" REF="311">
&s;ame permi&s;&s;ion, as a general rule, would produce liber|tini&s;m,
di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and mi&s;ery, among&s;t thou&s;ands, who
are now virtuous, and quiet, and happy, in their condition:
and it ought to &s;atisfy them to reflect, that when their
happine&s;s is &s;acrificed to the operation of an unrelenting
rule, it is &s;acrificed to the happine&s;s of the community.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures &s;eem to have drawn the obligation tighter
than the law of nature left it. &startq;Who&s;oever, &s;aith <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hall put away his wife, except it be for fornication,
and &s;hall marry another, committeth adultery; and
who&s;o marrieth her which is put away, doth commit
adultery.&endq; Matt. xix. 9. The law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> for rea&s;ons
of local expediency, permitted the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hu&s;band to put
away his wife; but whether for every cau&s;e, or for what
cau&s;es, appears to have been controverted among&s;t the in|terpreters
of tho&s;e times. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the precepts of who&s;e
religion were calculated for more general u&s;e and ob&s;erva|tion,
revokes this permi&s;&s;ion, as given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> &startq;for
the hardne&s;s of their hearts,&endq; and promulges a law which
was thenceforward to confine divorces to the &s;ingle cau&s;e
of adultery in the wife. And I &s;ee no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to
depart from the plain and &s;trict meaning of the words.
The rule was new. It both &s;urpri&s;ed and offended his di&s;|ciples;
yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> added nothing to relax or explain it.</P>
<P>Inferior cau&s;es may ju&s;tify the &s;eparation of hu&s;band
and wife, although they will not &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of
the marriage contract, as would leave either at liberty to
<PB N="274" REF="312">
marry again: for it is that liberty in which the danger and
mi&s;chief of divorces principally con&s;i&s;t. If the care of
children does not require that they &s;hould live together,
and it is become, in the &s;erious judgment of both, nece&s;|&s;ary
for their mutual happine&s;s that they &s;hould &s;eparate,
let them &s;eparate by con&s;ent. Neverthele&s;s this nece&s;&s;ity
can hardly exi&s;t, without guilt and mi&s;conduct on one &s;ide
or on both. Moreover cruelty, ill u&s;age, extreme violence,
or moro&s;ene&s;s of temper, or other great and continued pro|vocations,
will authorize the injured party to withdraw.
The law which impo&s;es the marriage vow, whereby the
parties promi&s;e to &startq;keep each other,&endq; mu&s;t be under&s;tood
to impo&s;e it with a &s;ilent re&s;ervation of the&s;e ca&s;es; be|cau&s;e
the &s;ame law has con&s;tituted a judicial relief from the
tyranny of the hu&s;band, by the divorce <HI>a men&s;&acirc; et toro,</HI> and
the provi&s;ion which it makes for the &s;eparate maintenance
of the injured wife. St. <HI>Paul</HI> likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hes between
a wife's merely &s;eparating her&s;elf from the family of her
hu&s;band, and her marrying again. &startq;Let not the wife
depart from her hu&s;band, but, and if &s;he do depart,
let her remain unmarried.&endq;</P>
<P>The law of this country, in conformity to our Sav|iour's
injunction, confines the di&s;&s;olution of the marriage
contract, to the &s;ingle ca&s;e of adultery, in the wife; and a
divorce in that ca&s;e can only be brought about by the ope|ration
of an act of parliament, founded upon a previous
&s;entence in the &s;piritual court, and a verdict again&s;t the
adulterer at common law; which together compo&s;e as
<PB N="275" REF="313">
complete an inve&s;tigation of the complaint as a cau&s;e can
receive. It has lately been propo&s;ed to the legi&s;lature to
annex a clau&s;e to the&s;e acts, re&s;training the offending party from marrying with the companion of her crime, who by
the forms of proceeding is always known and convicted;
for there is rea&s;on to fear, that adulterous connections are
often formed with the pro&s;pect of bringing them to this
conclu&s;ion; at lea&s;t, when the &s;educer has once captivated
the affection of a married woman, he may avail him&s;elf of
this tempting argument to &s;ubdue her &s;cruples, and com|plete
his victory; and the legi&s;lature, as the bu&s;ine&s;s is
managed at pre&s;ent, a&s;&s;i&s;ts by its interpo&s;ition, the crimi|nal
de&s;ign of the offenders, and confers a privilege where
it ought to inflict a puni&s;hment. The propo&s;al de&s;erved
an experiment; but &s;omething more penal, will I appre|hend
be found nece&s;&s;ary, to check the progre&s;s of this
alarming depravity. Whether a law might not be framed
directing <HI>the fortune of the adultere&s;s to de&s;cend as in ca&s;e of her
natural death,</HI> re&s;erving however a certain proportion of the
produce of it, by way of annuity for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, (&s;uch
annuity in no ca&s;e to exceed a certain &s;um,) and al&s;o &s;o far
&s;u&s;pending the e&s;tate in the hands of the heir, as to pre|&s;erve
the inheritance to any children &s;he might bear to a
&s;econd marriage, in ca&s;e there were none to &s;ucceed in the
place of their mother by the fir&s;t; whether, I &s;ay, &s;uch a
law would not render female virtue in higher life le&s;s vin|cible,
as well as the &s;educers of that virtue le&s;s urgent in
their &s;uit, we recommend to the deliberation of tho&s;e, who
are willing to attempt the reformation of this important,
<PB N="276" REF="314">
but mo&s;t incorrigible cla&s;s of the community. A pa&s;&s;ion
for &s;plendor, for expen&s;ive amu&s;ements and di&s;tinctions,
is commonly found in that de&s;cription of women who
would become the &s;ubjects of &s;uch a law, not le&s;s inor|dinate
than their other appetites. A &s;everity of the kind
we propo&s;e applies immediately to that pa&s;&s;ion. And
there is no room for a complaint of inju&s;tice, &s;ince the
provi&s;ions above &s;tated, with others which might be con|trived,
confine the puni&s;hment, &s;o far as it is po&s;&s;ible, to
the per&s;on of the offender; &s;uffering the e&s;tate to remain
to the heir, or within the family of the ance&s;tor from
whom it came, or to attend the appointments of his will.</P>
<P>Sentences of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, which relea&s;e the

the per&s;on at the altar, to all other men or women in
the world: but we can have no difficulty in pronouncing,
(whether we re&s;pect the end of the in&s;titution, or the plain
terms in which the contract is conceived) that whoever is
con&s;cious, at the time of his marriage, of &s;uch a di&s;like
to the woman he is about to marry, or of &s;uch a &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
attachment to &s;ome other woman, that he cannot rea&s;onably,
nor does in fact expect ever to entertain an affection
for his future wife, is guilty, when he pronounces the
marriage vow, of a direct and deliberate prevarication;
and that too, aggravated by the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e ideas of
religion, and of the Supreme Being, which the place, the
ritual, and the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion, cannot fail of
bringing to his thoughts. The &s;ame likewi&s;e of the wo|man.
This charge mu&s;t be imputed to all, who, from
mercenary motives, marry the objects of their aver&s;ion
and di&s;gu&s;t; and likewi&s;e to tho&s;e who de&s;ert, from any
motive whatever, the object of their affection, and, without
being able to &s;ubdue that affection, marry another.</P>
<P>The crime of fal&s;hood is al&s;o incurred by the man, who
intends, at the time of his marriage, to commence, re|new,
or continue a per&s;onal commerce with any other
woman. And the parity of rea&s;on, if a wife be capable
of &s;o much guilt, extends to her.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="319">
The marriage vow is violated,</P>
<P>I. By adultery.</P>
<P>II. By any behaviour, which, knowingly, renders the
life of the other mi&s;erable; as de&s;ertion, neglect, prodi|gality,
drunkenne&s;s, peevi&s;hne&s;s, penuriou&s;ne&s;s, jealou&s;y,
or any levity of conduct, which may admini&s;ter occa|&s;ion
of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>A late regulation in the law of marriages in this coun|try,
has made the con&s;ent of the father, if he be living,
of the mother, if &s;he &s;urvive the father, or of guardians, if
both parents be dead, nece&s;&s;ary to the marriage of a per|&s;on
under twenty-one years of age. By the <HI>Roman</HI> law,
the con&s;ent <HI>et avi et patris</HI> was required &s;o long as they
lived. In <HI>France,</HI> the con&s;ent of parents is nece&s;&s;ary to
the marriage of &s;ons, until they attain to thirty years of
age; of daughters, until twenty-five. In <HI>Holland,</HI> for
&s;ons, 'till twenty-five; for daughters, 'till twenty. And
this di&s;tinction between the &s;exes appears to be well found|ed,
for a woman &s;eems u&s;ually as well qualified at eigh|teen,
for the dome&s;tic and interior duties of a wife or mo|ther,

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty of Parents.</HEAD>
<P>THAT virtue, which confines its beneficence within
the walls of a man's own hou&s;e, we have been
accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as little better than a more refined
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and yet it will be confe&s;&s;ed, that the &s;ubject
and matter of this cla&s;s of duties are inferior to none, in
utility and importance: and where, it may be a&s;ked, is
virtue the mo&s;t valuable, but where it does the mo&s;t good?
What duty is the mo&s;t obligatory, but that, on which the
mo&s;t depends? And where have we happine&s;s and mi&s;ery
&s;o much in our power, or liable to be &s;o affected by our
conduct, as in our own families? It will al&s;o be acknow|ledged,
that the good order and happine&s;s of the world
is better upheld, whil&s;t each man applies him&s;elf to his
own concerns, and the care of his own family, to which
<PB N="283" REF="321">
he is pre&s;ent, than if every man, from an exce&s;s of mi&s;|taken
genero&s;ity, &s;hould leave his own bu&s;ine&s;s, to under|take
his neighbour's, which he mu&s;t always manage with
le&s;s knowledge, conveniency, and &s;ucce&s;s. If therefore
the low e&s;timation of the&s;e virtues be well founded, it
mu&s;t be owing, not to their inferior importance, but to
&s;ome defect or impurity in the motive. And indeed it
cannot be denied, but that it is in the power of <HI>a&s;&s;ociation,</HI>
&s;o to unite our children's intere&s;t with our own, as that
we &s;hall often pur&s;ue both from the &s;ame motive, place
both in the &s;ame object, and with as little &s;en&s;e of duty in
one pur&s;uit as in the other. Where this is the ca&s;e, the
judgement above &s;tated, is not far from the truth. And
&s;o often as we find a &s;olicitous care of a man's own family,
in a total ab&s;ence, or extreme penury of every other virtue,
or interfering with other duties, or directing its operation
&s;olely to the temporal happine&s;s of the children, placing
that happine&s;s in amu&s;ement and indulgence, whil&s;t they
are young, or in advancement of fortune, when they grow
up, there is rea&s;on to believe that this is the ca&s;e. In this
way the common opinion concerning the&s;e duties may be
accounted for, and defended. If we look to the &s;ubject of
them, we perceive them to be indi&s;pen&s;able; if we re|gard
the motive, we find them often not very meritorious.
Wherefore, although a man &s;eldom ri&s;es high in our e&s;teem,
who has nothing to recommend him be&s;ide the care of his
own family, yet we always condemn the neglect of this
duty with the utmo&s;t &s;everity; both by rea&s;on of the ma|nife&s;t
and immediate mi&s;chief which we &s;ee ari&s;ing from
<PB N="284" REF="322">
this neglect, and becau&s;e it argues a want not only of pa|rental
affection, but of tho&s;e moral principles, which
ought to come in aid of that affection, where it is want|ing.
And if, on the other hand, our prai&s;e and e&s;teem
of the&s;e duties be not proportioned to the good they pro|duce,
or to the indignation with which we re&s;ent the ab|&s;ence
of them, it is for this rea&s;on, that virtue is the mo&s;t
valuable, not where, in &s;trictne&s;s, it produces the mo&s;t
good, but where it is the mo&s;t wanted; which is not the
ca&s;e here, becau&s;e its place is often &s;upplied by in&s;tincts,
or involuntary a&s;&s;ociations. Neverthele&s;s, the offices of
a parent, may be di&s;charged from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their
obligation, as well as other duties; and a &s;en&s;e of this
obligation is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;timulus of
parental affection; e&s;pecially, in &s;tations of life, in which
the wants of a family cannot be &s;upplied without the con|tinual
hard labour of the father; nor without his refrain|ing
from many indulgences and recreations, which un|married
men, of like condition, are able to purcha&s;e.
Where the parental affection is &s;ufficiently &s;trong, or has
fewer difficulties to &s;urmount, a principle of duty may &s;till
be wanted, to direct and regulate its exertions; for other|wi&s;e
it is apt to &s;pend and wa&s;te it&s;elf in a womani&s;h fond|ne&s;s
for the per&s;on of the child; an improvident attention
to his pre&s;ent ea&s;e and gratification; a pernicious facility
and compliance with his humours; an exce&s;&s;ive and &s;uper|fluous
care to provide the externals of happine&s;s, with
little or no attention to the internal &s;ources of virtue and
&s;atisfaction. Univer&s;ally, wherever a parent's conduct is
<PB N="285" REF="323">
prompted or directed by a &s;en&s;e of duty, there is &s;o much
virtue.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much concerning the place which
parental duties hold in the &s;cale of human virtues, we
proceed to &s;tate and explain the duties them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When morali&s;ts tell us, that parents are bound to do all
they can for their children, they tell us more than is true;
for, at that rate, every expence which might have been
&s;pared, and every profit omitted, which might have been
made, would be criminal.</P>
<P>The duty of parents has its limits, like other duties;
and admits, if not of perfect preci&s;ion, at lea&s;t of rules de|finite
enough for application.</P>
<P>The&s;e rules may be explained under the &s;everal heads of
<HI>maintenance, education,</HI> and <HI>a rea&s;onable provi&s;ion for the child's
happine&s;s,</HI> in re&s;pect of outward condition.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Maintenance.</P>
<P>The wants of children make it nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome per|&s;on
maintain them, and, as no one has a right to burthen
others by his act, it follows, that the parents are bound to
undertake this charge them&s;elves. Be&s;ide this plain infe|rence,
the affection of parents to their children, if it be
in&s;tinctive, and the provi&s;ion which God has prepared in
<PB N="286" REF="324">
the per&s;on of the mother, for the &s;u&s;tentation of the in|fant,
concerning the exi&s;tence and de&s;ign of which, there
can be no doubt, are manife&s;t indications of the divine
will.</P>
<P>From hence we learn the guilt of tho&s;e, who run away
from their families, or, what is much the &s;ame, in con|&s;equence
of idlene&s;s or drunkenne&s;s throw them upon a
pari&s;h; or who leave them de&s;titute at their death, when
by diligence and frugality they might have laid up a pro|vi&s;ion
for their &s;upport: al&s;o of tho&s;e, who refu&s;e or ne|glect
the care of their ba&s;tard offspring, abandoning them
to a condition in which they mu&s;t either peri&s;h or become
burthen&s;ome to others; for the duty of maintenance, like
the rea&s;on upon which it is founded, extends to ba&s;tards
as well as to legitimate children.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian &s;criptures, although they concern them|&s;elves
little with maxims of prudence or oeconomy, and
much le&s;s authorize worldly mindedne&s;s or avarice, have
yet declared in explicit terms their judgement of the obli|gation
of this duty, &startq;if any provide not for his own, e&s;|pecially
for tho&s;e of his own hou&s;hold, he hath denied the
faith, and is wor&s;e than an infidel,&endq; (1. Tim. v. 8.) he
hath di&s;graced the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, and fallen &s;hort in a
duty which even infidels acknowledge.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Education.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="325">
Education, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word,
may comprehend, every preparation that is made in our
youth, for the &s;equel of our lives: and in this &s;en&s;e, I
u&s;e it.</P>
<P>Some &s;uch preparation is nece&s;&s;ary for children of all
conditions, becau&s;e without it, they mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, and
probably will be vicious, when they grow up, either from
want of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or from want of rati|onal
and inoffen&s;ive occupation. In civilized life, every
thing is effected by art and &s;kill. Whence a per&s;on who
is provided with neither (and neither can be acquired
without exerci&s;e and in&s;truction) will be u&s;ele&s;s; and he
that is u&s;ele&s;s, will generally be at the &s;ame time mi&s;|chievous
to the community: &s;o that to &s;end an unedu|cated
child into the world, is injurious to the re&s;t of man|kind;
it is little better than to turn out a mad dog, or a
wild bea&s;t into the &s;treets.</P>
<P>In the inferior cla&s;&s;es of the community, this principle
condemns the neglect of parents, who do not inure their
children betimes to labour and re&s;traint, by providing
them with apprentice&s;hips, &s;ervices, or other regular em|ployment;
but &s;uffer them to wa&s;te their youth, in idle|ne&s;s
and vagrancy, or to betake them&s;elves to &s;ome lazy,
trifling, and precarious calling; for the con&s;equence, of
having thus ta&s;ted the &s;weets of natural liberty, at an age
when their pa&s;&s;ion and reli&s;h for it are at the highe&s;t, is,
that they become incapable for the remainder of their lives
<PB N="288" REF="326">
of continued indu&s;try or per&s;evering attention to any thing;
&s;pend their time, in a mi&s;erable &s;truggle between the impor|tunity
of want, and the irk&s;omene&s;s of regular application;
and are prepared to embrace every expedient, which pre|&s;ents
a hope, of &s;upplying their nece&s;&s;ities, without con|fining
them to the plough, the loom, the &s;hop, or the
counting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the middle orders of &s;ociety, tho&s;e parents are mo&s;t
reprehen&s;ible, who neither qualify their children for a pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
nor enable them to live without one<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t the Athenians, if the parent did not put his child into a way of getting a livelihood, the child was not bound to make provi&s;ion for the parent when old and nece&s;&s;itous.</NOTE>: and tho&s;e
in the highe&s;t, who from indolence, indulgence, or ava|rice,
omit to procure their children tho&s;e liberal attain|ments,
which are nece&s;&s;ary to make them u&s;eful in the
&s;tations, to which they are de&s;tined. A man of fortune,
who permits his &s;on to con&s;ume the &s;ea&s;on of education,
in hunting, &s;hooting, or in frequenting hor&s;e-races, a&s;|&s;emblies,
or other unedifying though not vicious diver|&s;ions,
defrauds the community of a benefactor, and be|queaths
them a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>Some, though not the &s;ame preparation for the &s;equei
of their lives, is nece&s;&s;ary for youth of every de&s;cription&mdash;and
therefore for ba&s;tards, as well as for children of better
expectations. Consequently, they who leave the educa|tion
of their ba&s;tards to chance, contenting them&s;elves
<PB N="289" REF="327">
with making provi&s;ion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, de&s;ert half
their duty.</P>
<P>III. A rea&s;onable provi&s;ion for the happine&s;s of a child, in
re&s;pect of outward condition, requires three things: a
&s;ituation &s;uited to his habits and rea&s;onable expectations;
a competent provi&s;ion for the exigences of that &s;itua|tion,
and a probable &s;ecurity for his virtue.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t articles will vary with the condition of
the parent. A &s;ituation &s;omewhat approaching in rank
and condition to the parent's own; or, where that is not
practicable, &s;imilar to what other parents of like condition
provide for their children, bounds the rea&s;onable, as well
as, generally &s;peaking, the actual expectations of the
child, and therefore contains the extent of the parent's ob|ligation.</P>
<P>Hence, a pea&s;ant &s;atisfies his duty, who &s;ends out his
children, properly in&s;tructed for their occupation, to hu&s;|bandry,
or to any branch of manufacture. Clergymen,
lawyers, phy&s;icians, officers in the army or navy, gentle|men
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing moderate fortunes of inheritance, or exer|ci&s;ing
trade in a large or liberal way, are required by the
&s;ame rule to provide their &s;ons with learned profe&s;&s;ions,
commi&s;&s;ions in the army or navy, places in public offices,
or reputable branches of merchandi&s;e.&mdash;Providing a child
with a &s;ituation, includes a competent &s;upply for the ex|pences
of that &s;ituation, until the profits of it enable the
<PB N="290" REF="328">
child to &s;upport him&s;elf. Noblemen, and gentlemen of
high rank and fortune, may be bound to tran&s;mit an in|heritance
to the repre&s;entatives of their family, &s;ufficient
for their &s;upport, without the aid of a trade or profe&s;&s;ion,
to which, there is little hope, that a youth who has been
flattered with other expectations, will apply him&s;elf with
diligence or &s;ucce&s;s. In the&s;e parts of the world, public
opinion has a&s;&s;orted the members of the community into
four or five general cla&s;&s;es; each cla&s;s comprizing a great
variety of employments and profe&s;&s;ions; the choice of
which mu&s;t be committed to the private di&s;cretion of the
parent.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The health and virtue of a child's future life, are con&s;iderations &s;o &s;uperior to all others, that whatever is likely to have the &s;malle&s;t influence upon the&s;e, de&s;erves a parent's fir&s;t attention. In re&s;pect of health, agri|culture, and all active, rural, and out-of-door employments, are to be pre|ferred to manufactures, and &s;edentary occupations. In re&s;pect of virtue, a cour&s;e of dealings in which the advantage is mutual, in which the profit on one &s;ide is connected with the benefit of the other (which is the ca&s;e in trade, and all &s;erviceable art or labour) is move fa|vourable to the moral character, than callings, in which one man's gain is another man's lo&s;s, in which, what you acquire, is acquired without equivalent, and parted with in di&s;tre&s;s; as in gaming, and whatever partakes of gaming, and in the predatory profits of war. The following distinctions al&s;o de&s;erve notice. A bu&s;ine&s;s, like a retail trade, in which the profits are &s;mall and frequent, and accruing from the employment, furni&s;hes a moderate and con&s;tant engagement to the mind, and &s;o far, &s;uits better with the general di&s;po&s;ition of mankind, than pro|fe&s;&s;ions which are &s;upported by fixed &s;alaries, as &s;tations in the church, army, navy, revenue, public offices, &amp;c. or wherein the profits are made in large &s;ums, by a few great concerns, or fortunate adventures; as in many branches of whole&s;ale and foreign merchandize, in which the occu|pation is neither &s;o con&s;tant, nor the activity &s;o kept alive by immediate encouragement. For &s;ecurity, manual arts exceed merchandize, and &s;uch as &s;upply the wants of mankind are better than tho&s;e which mini&s;ter to their plea&s;ure. Situations which promi&s;e an early &s;ettlement in marriage, are on many accounts to be cho&s;en before tho&s;e, which require a longer wait|ing for a larger e&s;tabli&s;hment.</NOTE> All that can be exacted from parents as a duty,
<PB N="291" REF="329">
and therefore the only rule which a morali&s;t can deliver
upon the &s;ubject is, that they ehdeavour to pre&s;erve their
children in the <HI>cla&s;s</HI> in which they are born; that is to
&s;ay, in which others of &s;imilar expectations are accu&s;tomed
to be placed, and that they to careful to confine their
hopes and habits of indulgence, to objects which will con|tinue
to be attainable.</P>
<P>It is an ill-judged thrift in &s;ome rich parents, to bring
up their &s;ons to mean employments, for the &s;ake of &s;aving
the charge of a more expen&s;ive education; for the&s;e &s;ons,
when they become ma&s;ters of their liberty and fortune,
will hardly continue in occpations, by which they think
them&s;elves degraded; and are &s;eldom qualified for any
thing better.</P>
<P>An attention, in the fir&s;t place, to the exigencies of the
children's re&s;pective conditions in the world; and a regard,
in the &s;econd place, to their rea&s;onable expectations, always
po&s;tponing the expectations to the exigencies, when both
cannot be &s;atisfied, ought to guide parents in the di&s;po&s;al
of their fortunes after their death. And the&s;e exigencies
and expectations mu&s;t be mea&s;ured by the &s;tandard which
cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed; for there is a certain appearance,
<PB N="292" REF="330">
attendance, e&s;tabli&s;hment, and mode of living, which
cu&s;tom has annexed to the &s;everal ranks and orders of civil
life, (and, which compo&s;e what is called <HI>decency</HI>) together
with a certain &s;ociety, and particular plea&s;ures belonging
to each cla&s;s; and a young per&s;on, who is with-held from
&s;haring in the&s;e, by want of fortune, can &s;carcely be &s;aid
to have a fair chance for happine&s;s: the indignity and mor|tification
of &s;uch a &s;eclu&s;ion being what few tempers can
bear, or bear with contentment. And as to the &s;econd
con&s;ideration, of what a child may rea&s;onably expect from
his parent, he will expect, what he &s;ees all, or mo&s;t o|thers,
in &s;imilar circum&s;tances receive; and we can hard|ly
call expectations, unrea&s;onable, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to
&s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>By virtue of this rule, a parent is ju&s;tified in making a
difference between his children, according as they &s;tand in
greater or le&s;s need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fortune, in con|&s;equence
of the difference of their age or &s;ex, or of the &s;itu|ations
in which they are placed, or the various &s;ucce&s;s
which they have met with.</P>
<P>On account of the few lucrative employments which
are left to the female &s;ex, and by con&s;equence the little
opportunity they have of adding to their income, daugh|ters
ought to be the particular objects of a parent's care
and fore&s;ight: and as an option of marriage, from which
they can rea&s;onably expect happine&s;s, is not pre&s;ented to
every woman who de&s;erves it; e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent
<PB N="293" REF="331">
times, in which a licentious celibacy, &s;eems to have grown
into fa&s;hion with the men, a father &s;hould endeavour to
enable his daughters to lead a &s;ingle life with independen|cy
and decorum; even though he &s;ubtract more for that
purpo&s;e, from the portions of his &s;ons, than is agreeable
to modern u&s;age, or than they expect.</P>
<P>But when the exigencies of their &s;everal &s;ituations are
provided for, and not before, a parent ought to admit the
&s;econd con&s;ideration, the &s;atisfaction of his children's ex|pectations;
and upon that principle to prefer the elde&s;t
&s;on to the re&s;t, and &s;ons to daughters: which con&s;titutes.
the right, and the whole right of primogeniture, and the
rea&s;on of the preference of one &s;ex to the other. The pre|ference,
indeed, of the fir&s;t born has one public good effect,
that if the e&s;tate were divided equally among&s;t the &s;ons,
it would probably make them all idle; whereas, by the
pre&s;ent rule of de&s;cent, it makes only one &s;o; which is
the le&s;s evil of the two. And it mu&s;t farther be ob&s;erved
on the part of &s;ons, that if the re&s;t of the community
make it a rule, to prefer &s;ons to daughters, an individual
of that community ought to guide him&s;elf by the &s;ame
rule, upon principles of mere equality. For as the &s;on
&s;uffers by the rule, in the fortune he may expect in mar|riage,
it is but rea&s;onable that he &s;hould receive the ad|vantage
of it in his own inheritance. Indeed, whatever
the rule be, as to the preference of one &s;ex to the other,
marriage re&s;tores the equality. And as money is generally
more convertible to profit, and more likely to promote
<PB N="294" REF="332">
indu&s;try, in the hands of men than women, the cu&s;tom of
this country may properly be complied with, when it does
not interfere with the weightier rea&s;on explained in the
la&s;t paragraph.</P>
<P>The point of the children's actual expectations, together
with the expediency of &s;ubjecting the illicit commerce of
the &s;exes to every di&s;couragement it can receive, makes
the difference between the claims of legitimate children
and of ba&s;tards. But neither rea&s;on will ju&s;tify, in any
ca&s;e, the leaving of ba&s;tards to the world, without provi|&s;ion,
education, or profe&s;&s;ion; or, what is more cruel,
without the means of continuing in the &s;ituation to which
the parent has introduced them: which la&s;t, is to leave
them to inevitable mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t requi&s;ite, namely, a provi&s;ion for the ex|igencies
of his &s;ituation is &s;atisfied, a parent may dimini&s;h
a child's portion, in order to puni&s;h any flagrant crime,
or to puni&s;h contumacy and want of filial duty, in in|&s;tances
not otherwi&s;e criminal; for a child, who is con|&s;cious
of bad behaviour, or of contempt of his parent's
will and happine&s;s, cannot rea&s;onably expect the &s;ame
in&s;tances of his munificence.</P>
<P>A child's vices may be of that &s;ort, and his vicious ha|bits
&s;o incorrigible, as to afford much the &s;ame rea&s;on for
expecting that he will wa&s;te or mi&s;employ the fortune put
into his power, as if he were mad or idioti&s;h; in which
<PB N="295" REF="333">
ca&s;e a parent may treat him as a madman or an idiot; that
is, may deem it &s;ufficient to provide for his &s;upport, by
an annuity equal to his wants and innocent enjoyments,
and which he may be re&s;trained from alienating. This
&s;eems to be the only ca&s;e, in which a di&s;inheri&s;on, nearly
ab&s;olute, is ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>Let not a father hope to excu&s;e an inofficious di&s;po&s;ition
of his fortune, by alledging, that &startq;every man may do
what he will with his own.&endq; All the truth which this
expre&s;&s;ion contains, is, that his di&s;cretion is under no con|troul
of law; and that his will, however capricious, will
be valid. This, by no means, ab&s;olves his con&s;cience
from the obligations of a parent, or imports that he may
neglect, without inju&s;tice, the &s;everal wants and expec|tations
of his family, in order to gratify a whim, or a
pique; or indulge a preference, founded in no rea&s;onable
di&s;tinction of merit or &s;ituation. Although, in his inter|cour&s;e
with his family, and the le&s;&s;er endearments of do|me&s;tic
life, a parent may not always re&s;i&s;t his partiality
to a favourite child, (which, however, &s;hould he both
avoided and concealed, as oftentimes productive of la&s;ting
jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents) yet when he &s;its down to make
his will, the&s;e tenderne&s;&s;es mu&s;t give, place to more
manly deliberations.</P>
<P>A father of a family is bound to adju&s;t his oeconomy
with a view to the&s;e demands upon his fortune; and un|til
a &s;ufficieney for the&s;e ends is acquired, or in due time
<PB N="296" REF="334">
<HI>probably</HI> will be acquired, (for, in human affairs <HI>probability</HI> is
enough) frugality and exertions of indu&s;try are duties; and
he is ju&s;tified in declining expen&s;ive liberality; for to take
from tho&s;e who want, in order to give to tho&s;e who want,
adds nothing to the &s;tock of public happine&s;s.&mdash;Thus far,
therefore, and no farther, the plea of &startq;children,&endq; &startq;large
families,&endq; &startq;charity begins at home,&endq; &amp;c. is an excu&s;e for
par&s;imony, and an an&s;wer to tho&s;e who &s;olicit our bounty.
Beyond this point, as the u&s;e of riches becomes le&s;s, the
de&s;ire of <HI>laying up</HI> &s;hould abate proportionably. The truth
is, our children gain le&s;s than we imagine, in the chance
of this world's happine&s;s, or even of its external pro&s;pe|rity,
by &s;etting out in it with large capitals. Of tho&s;e
who die rich, a great part begun with little. And, in
re&s;pect of enjoyment, there is no compari&s;on between a
fortune, which a man acquires him&s;elf, by a fruitful indu&s;try,
or a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and one
found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or received from another.</P>
<P>A principal part of a parent's duty is &s;till behind, viz.
the u&s;ing of proper precautions and expedients, in order
to form and pre&s;erve his children's virtue.</P>
<P>To us, who believe, that in one &s;tage or other of our
exi&s;tence, virtue will conduct to happine&s;s, and vice ter|minate
in mi&s;ery; and who ob&s;erve withal, that men's
virtues and vices are, to a certain degree, produced or af|fected
by the management of their youth, and the &s;itua|tions
in which they are placed: to all who attend to the&s;e
<PB N="297" REF="335">
rea&s;ons, the obligation to con&s;ult a child's virtue will ap|pear
to differ in nothing from that, by which the parentis
bound to provide for his maintenance or fortune. The
child's intere&s;t is concerned in the one means of happine&s;s,
as well as in the other; and both means are equally, and
almo&s;t exclu&s;ively, in the parent's power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point to be endeavoured after is, to impre&s;s
upon children, the idea of <HI>accountablene&s;s,</HI> that is, to ac|cu&s;tom
them to look forward to the con&s;equences of their
actions in another world; which can only be brought
about by the parents vi&s;ibly acting with a view to the&s;e
con&s;equences them&s;elves. Parents, to do them ju&s;tice,
are &s;eldom &s;paring in le&s;&s;ons of virtue and religion; in ad|monitions
which co&s;t little, and profit le&s;s, whil&s;t their
<HI>example</HI> exhibits a continual contradiction to what they
teach. A father, for in&s;tance, will with much &s;olemnity
and apparent earne&s;tne&s;s, warn his &s;on again&s;t idlene&s;s, ex|ce&s;s
in drinking, debauchery, and extravagance, who
him&s;elf loiters about all day without employment; comes
home every night drunk; is made infamous in his neigh|bourhood,
by &s;ome profligate connection; and wa&s;tes the
fortune which &s;hould &s;upport or remain a provi&s;ion for his
family, in riot, or luxury, or o&s;tentation. Or he will di&s;|cour&s;e
gravely before his children of the obligation and
importance of revealed religion, whil&s;t they &s;ee frivolous,
and oftentimes feigned excu&s;es detain him from its mo&s;t
rea&s;onable and &s;olemn ordinances. Or he will &s;et before
them, perhaps, the &s;upreme and tremendous authority of
<PB N="298" REF="336">
Almighty God; that &s;uch a being ought not to be
named, or even thought upon, without &s;entiments of awe
and veneration. This may be the lecture he delivers to
his family one hour; when the next, if an occasion ari&s;e to
excite his anger, his mirth, or his &s;urpri&s;e, they will hear him
treat the name of the Deity with the mo&s;t irreverent pro|fanation,
and &s;port with the terms and denunciations of
the chri&s;tian religion, as if they were the language of &s;ome
ridiculous and long exploded &s;uper&s;tition. Now even a
child is not to be impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch mockery. He
&s;ees through the grimace of this counterfeited concern for
virtue. He di&s;covers that his parent is acting a part; and
receives his admonitions, as he would hear the &s;ame max|ims
from the mouth of a player. And when once this
opinion has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the child's mind, it has a
fatal effect upon the parent's influence in all &s;ubjects; even
in tho&s;e, in which he him&s;elf may be &s;incere and con|vinced.
Whereas a &s;ilent, but ob&s;ervable regard to the
duties of religion in the parent's own behaviour, will take
a &s;ure and gradual hold of the child's di&s;po&s;ition, much
beyond formal reproofs and chidings, which, being gene|rally
prompted by &s;ome pre&s;ent provocation, di&s;cover more
of anger than of principle, and are always received with a
temporary alienation and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>A good parent's fir&s;t care is to be virtuous him&s;elf; his
&s;econd, to make his virtues as ea&s;y and engaging to tho&s;e
about him, as their nature will admit. Virtue it&s;elf of|fends,
when coupled with forbidding manners. And &s;ome
<PB N="299" REF="337">
virtues may be urged to &s;uch exce&s;s, or brought forwards
&s;o un&s;ea&s;onably, as to di&s;courage and repel tho&s;e, who ob|&s;erve
and are acted upon by them, in&s;tead of exciting an in|clination
to imitate and adopt them. Young minds in par|ticular
are liable to the&s;e unfortunate impre&s;&s;ions. For in|&s;tance,
if a father's oeconomy degenerate into a minute and
tea&s;ing par&s;imony, it is odds, but that the &s;on, who has
&s;een and &s;uffered under it, &s;et out a &s;worn enemy to all
rules of order and frugality. If a father's piety be moro&s;e,
rigorous, and tinged with melancholy, perpetually break|ing
in upon the recreations of his family, and &s;urfeiting
them with the language of religion upon all occa&s;ions,
there is danger, le&s;t the &s;on carry from home with him a
&s;ettled prejudice again&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and religion, as incon|&s;i&s;tent
with every plan of a plea&s;urable life, and turn out,
when he mixes with the world, a character of levity or di&s;|&s;olutene&s;s.</P>
<P>Something likewi&s;e may be done, towards the correc|ting
or improving of tho&s;e early inclinations which chil|dren
di&s;cover, by di&s;po&s;ing them into &s;ituations the lea&s;t
dangerous to their particular characters.&mdash;Thus I would
make choice of a retired life, for young per&s;ons addicted
to licentious plea&s;ures; of private &s;tations, for the
proud and pa&s;&s;ionate; of liberal profe&s;&s;ions, and a town
life, for the mercenary and &s;otti&s;h: and not, accord|ing
to the general practice of parents, &s;end di&s;&s;olute
youths into the army; pernurious tempers to trade; or
make a crafty lad an attorney; or flatter a vain and
<PB N="300" REF="338">
haughty temper, with elevated names, or &s;ituations, or
callings, to which the fa&s;hion of the world has annexed
precedency and distinction, but in which his di&s;po&s;ition,
without at all promoting his &s;ucce&s;s, will &s;erve both to
multiply and exa&s;perate his di&s;appointments. In the &s;ame
way, that is, with a view to the particular frame and ten|dency
of the pupil's character, I would make choice of a
public or private education. The re&s;erved, timid, and in|dolent
will have their faculties called forth, and their
nerves excited and invigorated by a public education. Youths
of &s;trong &s;pirits and pa&s;&s;ions will be &s;afer in a private edu|cation.
At our public &s;chools, as far as I have ob&s;erved,
more literature is acquired, and more vice. Under private
tuition, a moderate proficiency in juvenile learning is &s;el|dom
exceeded, but oftener attained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Rights of Parents.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rights of Parents re&s;ult from their duties. If
it be the duty of a parent to educate his children,
to form them for a life of u&s;efulne&s;s and virtue, provide for
them &s;ituations, needful for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;uited to
their circum&s;tances, and prepare them for tho&s;e &s;ituations;
he has a right to &s;uch authority, and, in &s;upport of that
authority, to exerci&s;e &s;uch di&s;cipline, as may be nece&s;&s;ary
for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The law of nature acknowledges no
other foundation of a parent's right over his children, be|&s;ides
his duty towards them. (I &s;peak now of &s;uch
rights as may be enforced by coercion.) This relation con|fers
no property in their per&s;ons, or natural dominion over
them, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Since it is, in general, nece&s;&s;ary to determine the de&s;ti|nation
of children, before they are capable of judging of
their own happine&s;s, parents have a right to elect pro|fe&s;&s;ions
for them.</P>
<P>As the mother her&s;elf owes obedience to the father, her
authority mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his. In a competition, therefore,
<PB N="302" REF="340">
of commands, the father is to be obeyed. In ca&s;e of the
death of either, the authority, as well as duty, of both
parents, devolves upon the &s;urvivor.</P>
<P>The&s;e rights, always following the duty, belong like|wi&s;e
to guardians; and &s;o much of them, as is delegated
by the parents or guardians; belongs to tutors, &s;chool|ma&s;ters,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>From this principle, &startq;that the rights of parents re&s;ult
from their duty,&endq; it follows, that parents have no natural
right over the lives of their children, as was ab&s;urdly al|lowed
to <HI>Roman</HI> fathers; nor any to exerci&s;e unprofitable
&s;everities; nor to command the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes:
for the&s;e rights can never be wanted for the purpo&s;es of
their duty.</P>
<P>Nor, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, have parents any right to &s;ell
their children into &s;lavery. Upon which, by the way, we
may ob&s;erve, that the children of &s;laves are not, by the
law of nature, born &s;laves; for, as the ma&s;ter's right is
derived to him through the parent, it can never be greater
than the parent's own.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it appears, that parents not only pervert,
but exceed their ju&s;t authority, when they con&s;ult their
own ambition, intere&s;t, or prejudice, at the manife&s;t ex|pence
of their children's happine&s;s. Of which abu&s;e of
parental power, the following are in&s;tances: the &s;hutting
<PB N="303" REF="341">
up of daughters and younger &s;ons in nunneries and mona|&s;teries,
in order to pre&s;erve entire the e&s;tate and dignity of
the family; or the u&s;ing of any arts, either of kindne&s;s or
unkindne&s;s, to induce them to make choice of this way of
life them&s;elves: or in countries, where the clergy are
prohibited from marriage, putting &s;ons into the church
for the &s;ame end, who are never likely either to do or re|ceive
any good in it, &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate for this &s;acri|fice:
the urging of children to marriages, from which they
are aver&s;e, with the view of exalting or enriching the fa|mily,
or for the &s;ake of connecting e&s;tates, parties, or in|tere&s;ts;
or the oppo&s;ing of a marriage, in which the child
would probably find his happine&s;s, from a motive pride,
or avarice, of family ho&s;tility, or per&s;onal pique.</P>

which we owe to any other benefactor; <HI>in degree,</HI> ju&s;t &s;o
much exceeding other obligations, by how much a parent
has been a greater benefactor than any other friend. The
&s;ervices and attentions, by which filial-gratitude may be
te&s;tified, can be comprized within no enumeration. It
will &s;hew it&s;elf, in compliances with the will of the pa|rents,
however contrary it be to the child's own ta&s;te or
judgment, provided it be neither criminal, nor totally in|con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="306" REF="344">
with his happine&s;s; in a con&s;tant endeavour to
promote their enjoyments, prevent their wi&s;hes, and &s;often
their anxieties, in &s;mall matters as well as in great; in
a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in their bu&s;ine&s;s; in contributing to their
&s;upport, ea&s;e, or better accommodation, when their cir|cum&s;tances
require it; in affording them our company, in
preference to more amu&s;ing engagements; in waiting upon
their &s;ickne&s;s or decrepitude; in bearing with the infirmi|ties
of their health or temper, with the peevi&s;hne&s;s and
complaints, the unfa&s;hionable, negligent, au&s;tere manners,
and offen&s;ive habits, which often attend upon advanced
years; for, where mu&s;t old age find indulgence, if it do
not meet with it in the piety and partiality of children?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;erious contentions between parents and their
children, are tho&s;e commonly, which relate to marriage,
or the choice of profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>A parent has, in no ca&s;e, a right to de&s;troy his child's hap|pine&s;s.
If it be true, therefore, that there exi&s;t &s;uch per&s;onal
and exclu&s;ive attachments between individuals of different
&s;exes, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a particular man or woman in
marriage, be really nece&s;&s;ary to the child's happine&s;s; or
if it be true, that an aver&s;ion to a particular profe&s;&s;ion may
be involuntary and unconquerable; then it will follow,
that parents, where this is the ca&s;e, ought not to urge
<PB N="307" REF="345">
their authority, and that the child is not bound to obe
it.</P>
<P>The point is, to di&s;cover how far, in any particular in|&s;tance,
this <HI>is</HI> the ca&s;e. Whether the fondne&s;s of lovers
ever continues, with &s;uch inten&s;ity, and &s;o long, that
the &s;ucce&s;s of their de&s;ires con&s;titutes, or the di&s;appoint|ment
affects, any con&s;iderable portion of their happine&s;s,
compared with that of their whole life, it is difficult to
&s;ay; but there can be no difficulty in &s;aying, that not one
half of tho&s;e attachments, which young people conceive,
with &s;o much ha&s;te and pa&s;&s;ion, are of this &s;ort. I believe
it al&s;o to be true, that there are few aver&s;ions to a profe&s;|&s;ion,
which re&s;olution, per&s;everance, activity in going
about the duty of it, and above all, de&s;pair of changing,
will not &s;ubdue: yet there are &s;ome &s;uch. Wherefore,
a child who re&s;pects his parent's judgement, and is tender,
as he ought to be, of his happine&s;s, owes, at lea&s;t, &s;o
much deference to his will, as to try fairly and faithfully,
in one ca&s;e, whether time and ab&s;ence will not quench his
affection? and in the other, whether a longer continuance
in his profe&s;&s;ion may not reconcile him to it? The whole
depends upon the experiment being made on the child's
part with &s;incerity; and not merely with a de&s;ign of com|pa&s;&s;ing
his purpo&s;e at la&s;t, by means of a &s;imulated and
temporary compliance. It is the nature of love and hatred,
and of all violent affections, to delude the mind with a
per&s;ua&s;ion, that we &s;hall always continue to feel them, as
we feel them at pre&s;ent. We cannot conceive that they
<PB N="308" REF="346">
will either change or cea&s;e. Experience of &s;imilar or
greater changes in our&s;elves, or a habit of giving credit to
what our parents, or tutors, or books teach us, may con|troll
this per&s;ua&s;ion; otherwi&s;e it renders youth very un|tractable:
for they &s;ee clearly and truly, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible
they &s;hould be happy under the circum&s;tances pro|po&s;ed
to them, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind.&mdash;After a
&s;incere, but ineffectual endeavour, by the child, to accom|modate
his inclination to his parent's plea&s;ure, he ought
not to &s;uffer in his parent's affection, or in his fortunes.
The parent, when he has rea&s;onable proof of this, &s;hould
acquie&s;ce: at all events, the child is <HI>then</HI> at liberty to pro|vide
for his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Parents have, on no account, a right to urge their
children upon marriages, to which they are aver&s;e; nor
ought, in any &s;hape, to re&s;ent the children's di&s;obedience
of &s;uch commands. This is a different ca&s;e from oppo&s;ing
a match of inclination, becau&s;e the child's mi&s;ery is a much
more probable con&s;equence; it being ea&s;ier to live without
a per&s;on that we love, than with one whom we hate. Add
to this, that compul&s;ion in marriage leads to prevarication;
as the reluctant party promi&s;es an affection, which neither
exi&s;ts, nor is expected to take place: and parental, like
all human authority cea&s;es, at the point, where obedience
becomes criminal.</P>
<P>In the abovementioned, and in all conte&s;ts, between pa|rents
and children, it is the parent's duty to represent to
<PB N="309" REF="347">
the child the con&s;equences of his conduct, and it will be
found his be&s;t policy to repre&s;ent them with fidelity. It
is u&s;ual for parents to exaggerate the&s;e de&s;criptions beyond
probability, and by exaggeration, to lo&s;e all credit with
their children; and thus, in a great mea&s;ure, to defeat
their own end.</P>
<P>Parents are forbidden to interfere, where a tru&s;t is re|po&s;ed
per&s;onally in the &s;on; and where, con&s;equently,
the &s;on was expected, and by virtue of that expectation is
obliged, to pur&s;ue his own judgement, and not that of
any other; as is the ca&s;e with judicial magi&s;trates, in the
execution of their office; with members of the legi&s;lature
in their votes; with electors, where preference is to be
given to certain pre&s;cribed qualifications. The &s;on may
a&s;&s;i&s;t his own judgement by the advice of his father, or of
any one whom he chu&s;es to con&s;ult: but his Own judge|ment,
whether it proceed upon knowledge or authority,
ought finally to determine his conduct.</P>
<P>The duty of children to their parents, was thought

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Rights of Self-defence.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted, that in a &s;tate of nature, we might
lawfully defend the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant right, provided
it were a perfect determinate right, by any extremities,
which the ob&s;tinacy of the aggre&s;&s;or made nece&s;&s;ary. This
I que&s;tion; becau&s;e I que&s;tion, whether the general rule
be worth &s;u&s;taining at &s;uch an expence, and, apart from
the general con&s;equence of yielding to the attempt, it cannot
be contended, to be for the augmentation of human happi|ne&s;s,
that one man &s;hould lo&s;e his life or a limb, rather
than another a pennyworth of his property? Neverthe|le&s;s,
perfect rights can only be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their va|lue;
and it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the value, at which
the liberty of u&s;ing extreme violence begins. The per&s;on
attacked, mu&s;t balance, as well as he can, between the
general con&s;equence of yielding, and the particular effect
of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>However this right, if it exi&s;t in a &s;tate of nature, is
&s;u&s;pended by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil &s;ociety; becau&s;e
<HI>thereby</HI> other remedies are provided again&s;t attacks upon
our property, and becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and
&s;afety of the community, that the prevention, puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="313" REF="351">
and redre&s;s of injuries be adju&s;ted by public laws.
Moreover, as the individual is a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the recovery of
his right, or of a compen&s;ation for it, by the public &s;trength,
it is no le&s;s equitable than expedient, that he &s;hould &s;ub|mit
to public arbitration, the manner, as well as the mea|&s;ure
of the &s;atisfaction he is to obtain.</P>
<P>There is one ca&s;e in which all extremeties are ju&s;tifiable,
namely, when our life is a&s;&s;aulted, and it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary
for our pre&s;ervation to kill the a&s;&s;ailant. This is evi|dent
in a &s;tate of nature; unle&s;s it can be &s;hown, that we
are bound to prefer the aggre&s;&s;or's life to our own, that is
to &s;ay, to love our enemy <HI>better than</HI> our&s;elves, which
can never be a debt of ju&s;tice, nor any where appears to
be a duty of charity. Nor is the ca&s;e altered by our living
in civil &s;ociety; becau&s;e, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, the laws of
&s;ociety cannot interpo&s;e to protect us, nor by the nature
of the ca&s;e compel re&s;titution. This liberty is re&s;trained
to ca&s;es, in which no other probable means of pre&s;erving
our life remain, as flight, calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, di&s;arming
the adver&s;ary, &amp;c. The rule holds, whether the danger
proceed from a voluntary attack, as by an enemy, robber,
or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; or from an involuntary one, as by a madman,
or per&s;on &s;inking in the water, and dragging us after him:
or where two per&s;ons are reduced to a &s;ituation, in which one
or both of them mu&s;t peri&s;h; as in a &s;hip-wreck, where two
&s;eize upon a plank, which will &s;upport only one; though,
to &s;ay the truth, the&s;e extreme ca&s;es, which happen &s;el|dom,
and hardly, when they do happen, admit of moral
<PB N="314" REF="352">
agency, are &s;carcely worth mentioning, much le&s;s debat|ing.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance, which approaches the neare&s;t to the pre|&s;ervation
of life, and which &s;eems to ju&s;tify the &s;ame ex|tremities,
is the defence of cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>In all other ca&s;es, it appears to me the &s;afe&s;t; to con&s;i|der
the taking away of life as authori&s;ed by the law of
the land; and the per&s;on who takes it away, as in the
&s;ituation of a mini&s;ter or executioner of the law.</P>
<P>In which view, homicide, in <HI>England,</HI> is ju&s;tifiable:</P>
<P>1. To prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, which, when
committed, would be puni&s;hable with death. Thus it is
lawful to &s;hoot a highwayman, or one attempting to break
into a hou&s;e by night; but not by day: which particu|lar
di&s;tinction, by a con&s;ent that is remarkable, obtained
al&s;o in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law, as well as in the laws both of <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>2. In nece&s;&s;ary endeavours to carry the law into exe|cution,
as in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing riots, apprehending malefactors,
preventing e&s;capes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not know, that the law holds forth its authority
to any ca&s;es be&s;ides tho&s;e which fall within one or other
of the above de&s;criptions; or that after the exception of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Drunkenne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>DRUNKENNESS is either actual or habitual; ju&s;t as
it is one thing to be drunk, and another to be a
drunkard. What we &s;hall deliver upon the &s;ubject, mu&s;t
principally be under&s;tood of a <HI>habit</HI> of intemperance; al|though
<HI>part</HI> of the guilt and danger de&s;cribed may be ap|plicable
to ca&s;ual exce&s;&s;es; and <HI>all</HI> of it, in a certain de|gree,
fora&s;much as every habit is only a repetition of &s;ingle
in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chief of drunkenne&s;s, from which we are to
compute the guilt of it, con&s;i&s;ts in the following bad effects:</P>
<P>1. It betrays mo&s;t con&s;titutions either into extravagan|cies
of anger, or &s;ins of lewdne&s;s.</P>
<P>2. It di&s;qualifies men for the duties of their &s;tation, both
by the temporary di&s;order of their faculties, and at length,
by a con&s;tant incapacity and &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="354">
3. It is attended with expences, which can often be ill
&s;pared.</P>
<P>4. It is &s;ure to occa&s;ion unea&s;ine&s;s, to the family of the
drunkard.</P>
<P>5. It &s;hortens life.</P>
<P>To the&s;e con&s;equences of drunkenne&s;s mu&s;t be added
the peculiar danger and mi&s;chief of the <HI>example.</HI> Drun|kenne&s;s
is a &s;ocial fe&s;tive vice; apt, beyond any vice, I
can mention, to draw in others by the example. The
free-drinker collects his circle; the circle naturally &s;preads;
of tho&s;e, who are drawn within it, many become the cor|rupters
and centres of &s;ets and circles of their own; every
one countenancing, and, perhaps, emulating the re&s;t; 'till
a whole neighbourhood, be infe&s;ted, from the contagion, of
a &s;ingle example. This account is confirmed by what we
often ob&s;erve of drunkenne&s;s, that it is a <HI>local,</HI> vice; found
to prevail in certain countries, certain di&s;tricts of a country,
or in particular towns, without any rea&s;on to be given for
the fa&s;hion, but that it had been introduced by &s;ome po|pular
examples. With this reflection upon the &s;preading
quality of drunkenne&s;s, let us connect a remark which
belongs to the &s;everal evil effects above recited. The con|&s;equences
of a vice, like the &s;ymptoms of a di&s;ea&s;e, tho'
they be all enumerated in the de&s;cription, &s;eldom all meet
in the &s;ame &s;ubject. In the in&s;tance under con&s;ideration,
the age and temperature of one drunkard, may have little
<PB N="317" REF="355">
to fear from inflammations of lu&s;t or anger; the fortune
of a &s;econd, may not be injured by the expence; a third,
may have no family to be di&s;quieted by his irregularities;
and a fourth, may Po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;titution fortified again&s;t the
poi&s;on of &s;trong liquors. But if, as we always ought to
do, we comprehend, within the con&s;equences of our con|duct,
the mi&s;chief and tendency of the example, the above
circum&s;tances, however fortunate for the individual, will
be found to vary the guilt of his intemperance, le&s;s pro|bably,
than he &s;uppo&s;es. Although the wa&s;te of time
and money may be of &s;mall importance to you, it may be
of the utmo&s;t to &s;ome one or other whom your &s;ociety
cor|rupts.
Repeated, or long continued exce&s;&s;es, which hurt
not <HI>your</HI> health, may be fatal to your companion. Al|though
you have neither wife, nor child, nor parent, to
lament your ab&s;ence from home, or expect your return to
it with terror; other families, who&s;e hu&s;bands and fathers
have been invited to &s;hare in your, ebriety, or encouraged
to imitate it, may ju&s;tly lay their mi&s;ery or ruin at your
door. This will hold good, whether the per&s;on &s;educed,
be &s;educed immediately by you, or the vice be propagated
from you to him, through &s;everal intermediate examples.
A morali&s;t mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble all the&s;e con&s;iderations, to
judge
truly of a vice, which u&s;ually meets with milder names,
and more indulgence, than it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>I omit tho&s;e outrages upon one another, and upon the
peace and &s;afety of the neighbourhood, in which drunken
revels often end; and al&s;o tho&s;e deleterious and maniacal
<PB N="318" REF="356">
effects, which &s;trong liquors produce upon particular con|&s;titutions;
becau&s;e, in general propo&s;itions concerning
drunkenne&s;s; no con&s;equences &s;hould be included, but
what are con&s;tant enough to be generally expected.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s is repeatedly forbidden by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &startq;Be
not drunk with wine, wherein is exce&s;s.&endq; &startq;Let us
walk hone&s;tly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken|ne&s;s.&endq;

<HI>Cor.</HI> vi, 9.
10. The. &s;ame apo&s;tle likewi&s;e condemns drunkenne&s;s, as
peculiarly incon&s;i&s;tent with the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion; &startq;They
that be drunken, are drunken in the night; but let us,
who are of the day, be &s;ober.&endq; 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> v. 7. 8. We
are not concerned with the argument; the words amount
to a prohibition of drunkenne&s;s; and the authority is
conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion of &s;ome importance, how far drunken|ne&s;s
is an excu&s;e for the crimes which the drunken per&s;on
commits.</P>
<P>In the &s;olution of this que&s;tion, we will fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e
the drunken per&s;on to be altogether deprived of moral
agency, that is to &s;ay, of all reflection and fore&s;ight. In
this condition, it is evident, that he is no more capable of
guilt, than a madman; although, like him, he may be
extremely mi&s;chievous. The only guilt, with which he
<PB N="318" REF="357">
is chargeable, was incurred, when he voluntarily brought
him&s;elf into this, &s;ituation; And as every man is re&s;pon|&s;ible
for the con&s;equences which he fore&s;aw, or might have
fore&s;een, and for no other, this guilt will be in proportion
to the probability of &s;uch con&s;equences en&s;uing. From
which principle re&s;ults the following rule, viz. that the
guilt of any action, in a drunken man, bears the &s;ame pro|portion
to the guilt of the like action, in a &s;ober man,
that the probability of its being the con&s;equence of drun|kenne&s;s,
bears to ab&s;olute certainty. By virtue of this
rule, tho&s;e vices, which are the <HI>known</HI> effects of drunken|ne&s;s,
either in general, or upon particular con&s;titutions,
are, in all, or in men of &s;uch con&s;titutions, nearly as cri|minal,
as if committed with all their faculties and &s;en&s;es
about them.</P>
<P>If the privation of rea&s;on be only partial, the guilt will
be of a mixt nature. For &s;o much of his &s;elf-government,
as the drunkard retains, he is as re&s;pon&s;ible then, as at
any other time. He is entitled to no abatement, beyond
the &s;trict proportion, in which, his moral faculties are im|paired.
Now I call the guilt of the crime, if a &s;ober man
had committed it, the <HI>whole</HI> guilt. A per&s;on, in the con|dition
we de&s;cribe, incurs part of this, at the in&s;tant of per|petration,
and by bringing him&s;elf into this condition, he
incurred &s;uch a fraction, of the remaining part, as the dan|ger
of this con&s;equence was of an integral certainty. For
the &s;ake of illu&s;tration, we are at liberty to &s;uppo&s;e, that a
man lo&s;es half his moral faculties by drunkenne&s;s: this
<PB N="320" REF="358">
leaving him but half his re&s;pon&s;ibility, he incurs, when he
commits the action, half of the whole guilt. We will al|&s;o
&s;uppo&s;e that it was known before hand, that it was an
even chance, or half a certainty, that this crime would fol|low
his getting drunk. This makes him chargeable with
half of the remainder; &s;o that altogether, he is re&s;pon&s;ible
in three fourths of the guilt, which a &s;ober man would
have incurred by the &s;ame action.</P>
<P>I do not mean that any real ca&s;e can be reduced to num|bers;
or the calculation made with arithmetical preci&s;ion:
but the&s;e are the principles, and this the rule, by which
our general admea&s;urement of the guilt of &s;uch offences,
&s;hould be regulated.</P>
<P>The appetite for intoxicating liquors, appears to me to be
almo&s;t always <HI>acquired.</HI> One proof of which is, that it is apt to return only at particular times, and places; as after din|ner,
in the evening, on the market day, at the market town,
in &s;uch a company, at &s;uch a tavern. And this may be the
rea&s;on, that if a habit of drunkenne&s;s be ever overcome, it
is upon &s;ome change of place, &s;ituation, company, or pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
A man &s;unk deep in a habit of drunkenne&s;s, will
upon &s;uch occa&s;ions as the&s;e, when he finds him&s;elf
loo&s;ened from the a&s;&s;ociations which held him fa&s;t, &s;ome|times
make a plunge, and get out. In a matter of &s;uch great
importance, it is well worth while, where it is tolerably
<PB N="321" REF="359">
convenient, to change our habitation and &s;ociety, for the
&s;ake of the experiment.</P>
<P>Habits of drunkenne&s;s commonly take their ri&s;e, either
from a fondne&s;s for and connection with &s;ome company,
or &s;ome companion, already addicted to this practice;
which affords an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible invitation to take a &s;hare
in the indulgences, which tho&s;e about us are enjoying with
&s;o much apparent reli&s;h and delight: or from want of re|gular
employment, which is &s;ure to let in many &s;uperflu|ous
cravings, and cu&s;toms, and often this among&s;t the
re&s;t: or la&s;tly, from grief or fatigue, both which &s;trongly
&s;olicit that relief, which inebriating liquors admini&s;ter for
the pre&s;ent; and furni&s;h a &s;pecious excu&s;e for complying
with the inclination. But the habit, when once &s;et in,
is continued by different motives from tho&s;e to which it
owes its origin. Per&s;ons addicted to exce&s;&s;ive drinking,
&s;uffer, in the intervals of &s;obriety, and near the return of
their accu&s;tomed indulgence, a faintne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion
<HI>circa praecordia,</HI> which it exceeds the ordinary patience of
human nature to endure. This is u&s;ually relieved, for a
&s;hort time, by a repetition of the &s;ame exce&s;s: and to this
relief, as to the removal of every long continued pain,
they who have once experienced it, are urged almo&s;t be|yond
the power of re&s;i&s;tance. This is not all: as the li|quor
lo&s;es its <HI>&s;timulus,</HI> the do&s;e mu&s;t be increa&s;ed, to reach
the &s;ame pitch of elevation, or ea&s;e; which increa&s;e propor|tionably
accelerates the progre&s;s of all the maladies which
drunkenne&s;s brings on. Whoever reflects upon the vio|lence
<PB N="322" REF="360">
of the craving, in the advanced &s;tages of the habit,
and the fatal termination to which the gratification of
it leads, will, the moment he perceives the lea&s;t tendency
in him&s;elf of a growing inclination to intemperance, col|lect
his re&s;olution to this point; or, what, perhaps, he
will find his be&s;t &s;ecurity, arm him&s;elf with &s;ome peremp|tory
rule, as to the times and quantity of his indulgences.
I own my&s;elf a friend to the laying down of rules to our|&s;elves
of this &s;ort, and rigidly abiding by them. They
may be exclaimed again&s;t, as &s;tiff, but they are often &s;alu|tary.
Indefinite re&s;olutions of ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s, are apt to
yield to <HI>extraordinary</HI> occa&s;ions; and <HI>extraordinary</HI> occa&s;ions
to occur perpetually. Whereas the &s;tricter the rule is, the
more tenacious we grow of it: and many a man will
ab&s;tain, rather than break his rule, who would not ea&s;ily
be brought to exerci&s;e the &s;ame mortification, from higher
motives. Not to mention, that when our rule is once
known, we are provided with an an&s;wer to every impor|tunity.</P>
<P>There is a difference, no doubt, between convivial in|temperance,
and that &s;olitary &s;otti&s;hne&s;s, which waits
neither for company nor invitation. But the one, I am
afraid, commonly ends in the other: and this la&s;t, is the
ba&s;e&s;t degradation, to which the faculties and dignity of
human nature can be reduced.</P>

<P>THERE is no &s;ubject in morality, in which the con&s;i|deration
of <HI>general con&s;equences</HI> is more nece&s;&s;ary, than
in this of &s;uicide. Particular and extreme ca&s;es of &s;uicide

Albeit, this is no more, than what is &s;ometimes
true, of the mo&s;t acknowledged vices. I could propo&s;e
many po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, even of murder, which, if they
were detached from the general rule, and governed by
their own particular con&s;equences alone, it would be no

the latitude of &s;uch a rule? Who does not perceive, that it

is <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> for the purpo&s;e of this plea, but he who has lo&s;t
every capacity and opportunity of being u&s;eful, together
with the po&s;&s;ibility of recovering any degree of either;
which is a &s;tate of &s;uch complete de&s;titution and de&s;pair,
as cannot, I believe, be predicated of any man living.</P>
<P>Or rather, &s;hall we &s;ay, that to depart voluntarily out
of life, is lawful for tho&s;e alone, who leave none to lament
their death? If this con&s;ideration is to be taken into the
account at all, the &s;ubject of debate will be, not whe|ther
there are any to &s;orrow for us, but whether their
&s;orrow for our death will exceed that which we &s;hould
&s;uffer by continuing to live. Now this is a compari&s;on
of things, &s;o indeterminate in their nature, capable of &s;o
different a judgement, and concerning which, the judge|ment
will differ &s;o much, according to the &s;tate of the &s;pi|rits,
or the pre&s;&s;ure of any pre&s;ent anxiety, that it would
vary little in hypocondriacal con&s;titutions, from an un|qualified
licence to commit &s;uicide, whenever the di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="325" REF="363">
men felt or fancied, ro&s;e high enough to overcome the pain
and dread of death. Men are never tempted to de&s;troy
them&s;elves, but when under the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome grie|vous
unea&s;ine&s;s. The re&s;trictions of the rule, therefore,
ought to apply to the&s;e ca&s;es. But what effect can we
look for from a rule, which propo&s;es to weigh our own
pain, again&s;t that of another; the mi&s;ery that is felt,
again&s;t that which is only conceived; and in &s;o corrupt a
balance as the party's own di&s;tempered imagination?</P>
<P>In like manner, whatever other rule you a&s;&s;ign, it will
ultimately bring us to an indi&s;criminate toleration of &s;ui|cide,
in all ca&s;es, in which there is danger of its being
committed.</P>
<P>It remains, therefore, to enquire what would be the
effect of &s;uch a toleration: evidently, the lo&s;s of many
lives to the community, of which &s;ome might be u&s;e|ful
or important; the affliction of <HI>many</HI> families, and
the con&s;ternation of <HI>all;</HI> for mankind mu&s;t live in conti|nual
alarm for the fate of their friends and deare&s;t relations,
when the re&s;traints of religion and morality are withdrawn;
when every di&s;gu&s;t, which is powerful enough to tempt
men to &s;uicide, &s;hall be deemed &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify it;
and when the follies and vices, as well as the inevitable
calamities of human life, &s;o often make exi&s;tence a bur|then.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="364">
A &s;econd con&s;ideration, and perfectly di&s;tinct from the
former, is this. By continuing in the world, and the exerci&s;e
of tho&s;e virtues which remain within our power, we retain
the opportunity of meliorating our condition in a future
&s;tate. This argument, it is true, does not in &s;trictne&s;s prove
&s;uicide a crime, but if it &s;upply a motive to di&s;&s;uade us from
it, it comes to much the &s;ame thing. Now there is no
condition in human life, which is not capable of &s;ome
virtue, active or pa&s;&s;ive. Even piety and re&s;ignation
under the &s;ufferings to which we are called, te&s;tify a tru&s;t
and acquie&s;cence in the divine coun&s;els, more acceptable,
perhaps, than the mo&s;t pro&s;trate devotion; afford an edi|fying
example to all who ob&s;erve them, and may hope
for a recompence among the mo&s;t arduous of human vir|tues.
The&s;e qualities are always in the power of the mi|&s;erable;
indeed of none but the mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>The two con&s;iderations above &s;tated, belong to all ca&s;es
of &s;uicide whatever. Be&s;ides which general rea&s;ons, each
ca&s;e will be aggravated by its own proper and particular
con&s;equences; by the duties that are de&s;erted; by the
claims that are defrauded; by the lo&s;s, affliction, or di&s;|grace,
which our death, or the manner of it, cau&s;es to
our families, kindred, or friends; by the occa&s;ion we
give to many to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of our moral and re|ligious
profe&s;&s;ions, and, together with ours, tho&s;e of all
others; by the reproach we draw upon our order, calling,
or &s;ect; in a word, by a great variety of evil con&s;equences,
<PB N="327" REF="365">
attending upon peculiar &s;ituations, with &s;ome or other
of which, every actual ca&s;e of &s;uicide is chargeable.</P>
<P>I refrain from the common topics of &startq;de&s;erting our
po&s;t,&endq; &startq;throwing up our tru&s;t,&endq; &startq;ru&s;hing uncalled into
the pre&s;ence of our maker,&endq; with &s;ome others of the
&s;ame &s;ort, not becau&s;e they are <HI>common,</HI> (for that rather
affords a pre&s;umption in their favour) but becau&s;e I do not
perceive in them much argument, to which an an&s;wer
may not ea&s;ily be given.</P>
<P>Hitherto, we have pur&s;ued upon the &s;ubject the light
of nature alone, taking into the account, however, the expec|tation
of a future exi&s;tence, without which, our rea&s;oning
upon this, as indeed all rea&s;oning upon moral que&s;tions,
is vain. We proceed to enquire, whether any thing is to
be met with in &s;cripture, which may add to the probability
of the conclu&s;ions we have been endeavouring to &s;upport.
And here, I acknowledge, that there is neither any ex|pre&s;s
determination of the que&s;tion to be found, nor &s;uf|ficient
evidence to prove, that the ca&s;e of &s;uicide, was in
the contemplation of the law which prohibited murder.
Any inference, therefore, which we deduce from &s;cripture,
can be &s;u&s;tained only by con&s;truction and implication;
that is to &s;ay, although they, who were authorized to in|&s;truct
mankind, have not decided a question, which never,
&s;o far as appears to us, came before them; yet, I think,
they have left enough to con&s;titute a pre&s;umption, how
<PB N="328" REF="366">
they would have decided it, had it ever been propo&s;ed or
thought of.</P>
<P>What occurs to this purpo&s;e, is contained in the follow|ing
ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P>1. Human life is &s;poken of as a <HI>term</HI> a&s;&s;igned or pre|&s;cribed
to us. &startq;Let us run with patience the race that
is &s;et before us.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e.&endq;&mdash;&startq;That
I may fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy.&endq;&mdash;&startq;You have need of
patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye
might receive the promi&s;e.&endq; The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions appear to
me incon&s;i&s;tent with the opinion, that we are at liberty
to determine the duration of our lives for our&s;elves. If
this were the ca&s;e, with what propriety could life be
called a race, <HI>that is &s;et before us,</HI> or what is the &s;ame thing,
<HI>&startq;our cour&s;e;&endq;</HI> that is, the cour&s;e &s;et out, or appointed to
us? The remaining quotation is equally &s;trong: <HI>that after
ye have done the will of God,</HI> i. e. the duties of life, &s;o long as
God is plea&s;ed to continue you in it, &startq;ye might receive
the promi&s;es.&endq; According to this interpretation, the text
militates &s;trongly again&s;t &s;uicide; and they who reject
this paraphra&s;e, will plea&s;e to propo&s;e a better.</P>
<P>2. There is not one quality, which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his apo&s;tles
inculcate upon their followers, &s;o often, or &s;o earne&s;tly,
as that of patience under affliction. Now this virtue would
have been in a great mea&s;ure &s;uper&s;eded, and the exhor|tations
to it might have been &s;pared, if the di&s;ciples of
<PB N="329" REF="367">
his religion had been at liberty to quit the world, as &s;oon
as they grew weary of the ill u&s;age which they received
in it. When the evils of life pre&s;&s;ed &s;ore, they were to
look forward to a &startq;far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory;&endq; they were to receive them &startq;as the cha&s;tening
of the Lord;&endq; as intimations of his care and love: by
the&s;e and the like reflections, they were to &s;upport and
improve them&s;elves under their &s;ufferings, but not a hint
has any where e&s;caped, of relieving them&s;elves by a vo|luntary
death. The following text, in particular, &s;trongly
combats all impatience of di&s;tre&s;s, of which, the greate&s;t
is that which prompts to acts of &s;uicide: &startq;Con&s;ider him
that endured &s;uch contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf,
le&s;t ye be wearied and faint in your minds.&endq; I would
offer my comment upon this pa&s;&s;age, in the&s;e two queries;
fir&s;t, whether a chri&s;tian convert, who had been impelled,
by the continuance and urgency of his &s;ufferings, to de|&s;troy
his own life, would not have been thought, by the
author of this text, &startq;to have been weary,&endq; &startq;to have
fainted in his mind,&endq; to have fallen off from that example,
which is here propo&s;ed to the meditation of chri&s;tians in
di&s;tre&s;s? And yet, &s;econdly, whether &s;uch an act would
not have been attended with all the circum&s;tances of miti|gation,
which can excu&s;e or extenuate &s;uicide at this day?</P>
<P>3. The <HI>conduct</HI> of the apo&s;tles, and of the chri&s;tians of
the apo&s;tolic age, affords no ob&s;cure indication of their
&s;entiments upon this point. They lived, we are &s;ure, in
a confirmed per&s;ua&s;ion of the exi&s;tence, as well as of the
<PB N="330" REF="368">
happine&s;s, of a future &s;tate. They experienced in this
world, every extremity of external injury and di&s;tre&s;s.
To die then was gain. The change, which death brought
with it, was, in their expectation, infinitely beneficial.
Yet it never, that we can find, entered into the intention of
one of them, to ha&s;ten this change by an act of &s;uicide;
from which it is difficult to &s;ay, what motive could have &s;o
univer&s;ally with-held them, be&s;ides an apprehen&s;ion of
&s;ome unlawfulne&s;s in the expedient.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated what we have been able to collect, in op|po&s;ition
to the lawfulne&s;s of &s;uicide, by way of direct
proof, it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to open a &s;eparate controver&s;y
with all the arguments, which are made u&s;e of to defend
it; which would only lead us into a repetition of what
has been offered already. The following argument, how|ever,
being &s;omewhat more artificial and impo&s;ing than
the re&s;t, as well as di&s;tinct from the general con&s;ideration
of the &s;ubject, cannot &s;o properly be pa&s;&s;ed over. If we
deny to the individual, a right over his own life, it &s;eems
impo&s;&s;ible, it is &s;aid, to reconcile with the law of nature,
that right which the &s;tate claims and exerci&s;es over the
lives of its &s;ubjects, when it ordains or inflicts capital pu|ni&s;hments.
For this right, like all other ju&s;t authority in
the &s;tate, can only be derived from the compact and vir|tual
con&s;ent of the citizens which compo&s;e the &s;tate; and
it &s;eems &s;elf-evident, if any principle in morality be &s;o,
that no one, by his con&s;ent, can transfer to another, a
right, which he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf. It will be
<PB N="331" REF="369">
equally difficult to account for the power of the &s;tate to
commit its &s;ubjects to the dangers of war, and to expo&s;e
their lives without &s;cruple in the field of battle; e&s;pecially
in offen&s;ive ho&s;tilities, in which the privileges of &s;elf-defence
cannot be pleaded with any appearance of truth:
and &s;till more difficult to explain, how in &s;uch, or in any
circum&s;tances, prodigality of life can be a virtue, if the
pre&s;ervation of it, be a duty of our nature.</P>
<P>This whole rea&s;oning &s;ets out from one error, namely, that
the &s;tate acquires its right over the life of the &s;ubject, from
the &s;ubject's own con&s;ent, as a part of what originally and per|&s;onally
belonged to him, and which he has made over to his
governors. The truth is, the &s;tate derives this right, nei|ther
from the con&s;ent of the &s;ubject, nor through the me|dium
of that con&s;ent, but, as I may &s;ay, immediately
from the donation of the Deity. Finding that &s;uch a pow|er,
in the &s;overeign of the community, is expedient, if
not nece&s;&s;ary for the community it&s;elf, it is ju&s;tly pre|&s;umed
to be the will of God, that the &s;overeign &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e it. It is this <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> which con&s;ti|tutes
the right, it is the &s;ame indeed which con&s;titutes
every other; and if there were the like rea&s;ons to autho|rize
the pre&s;umption in the ca&s;e of private per&s;ons, &s;ui|cide
would be as ju&s;tifiable as war, or capital executions.
But, until it can be &s;hown, that the power over human
life, may be converted to equal advantage in the hands of
individuals over their own, as in tho&s;e of the &s;tate over
the lives of the &s;ubjects, and that it may be entru&s;ted with
<PB N="332" REF="370">
equal &s;afety to both, there is no room for arguing from
the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a right in one, to the toleration of
it in the other.</P>

<P>IN one &s;en&s;e, every duty is a duty towards God, &s;ince it
is his will which makes it a duty: but there are &s;ome
duties, of which God is the object, as well as the author;
and the&s;e are peculiarly, and in a more appropriated &s;en&s;e,
called <HI>duties towards God.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;ilent piety, which con&s;i&s;ts in a habit of tracing
out the creator's wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, in the objects
<PB N="334" REF="372">
about us, or in the hi&s;tory of his di&s;pen&s;ations; of refer|ring
the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy to his bounty, and of re&s;orting
to his &s;uccour in our di&s;tre&s;s, may po&s;&s;ibly be more ac|ceptable
to the Deity, than any vi&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions of de|votion
whatever. Yet the&s;e latter, which, although they
may be excelled, are not &s;uper&s;eded by the former, com|po&s;e
the only part of the &s;ubject, which admits of direc|tion
or di&s;qui&s;ition from a morali&s;t.</P>
<P>Our duty towards God, &s;o far as it is external, is di|vided
into wor&s;hip and reverence. God is the immediate
object of both: and the difference between them is, that
the one con&s;i&s;ts in action; the other in forbearance.
When we go to church, on the Lord's day, led thither by
a sense of duty towards God, we perform an act of wor&s;hip:
when we re&s;t in a journey, upon that day, from the &s;ame
motive, we di&s;charge a duty of reverence.</P>
<P>Divine wor&s;hip is made up of adoration, thank&s;giving,
and prayer. But, as what we have to offer concerning
the two former, may be ob&s;erved of prayer, we &s;hall
make that the title of the following chapters, and the di|rect
&s;ubject of our con&s;ideration.</P>

<PB N="335" REF="373">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty, and of the Efficacy of Prayer, &s;o far as the &s;ame appear, from the Light of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN one man de&s;ires to obtain any thing of ano|ther,
he betakes him&s;elf to intreaty: and this
may be ob&s;erved of mankind in all ages and countries of
the world. Now what is univer&s;al, may be called natu|ral;
and it &s;eems probable, that God, as our &s;upreme
governor, &s;hould expect that towards him&s;elf, which, by
a natural impul&s;e, or by the irre&s;i&s;tible order of our con|&s;titution,
he has prompted us to pay to every other being
on whom we depend.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>Again, prayer is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up in the minds of
mankind, a &s;en&s;e of God's agency in the univer&s;e, and of
their dependence upon him.</P>
<P>But after all, the duty of prayer depends upon its effi|cacy
for I confe&s;s my&s;elf unable to conceive, how any
man can pray, or be obliged to pray, who expects nothing
from his prayer; but is per&s;uaded, at the time he
<PB N="336" REF="374">
utters his reque&s;t, that it cannot po&s;&s;ibly produce the
&s;malle&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon the being to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed,
or advantage to him&s;elf. Now the efficacy of prayer im|ports,
that we obtain &s;omething in con&s;equence of pray|ing,
which we &s;hould not have received without prayer;
again&s;t all expectation of which, the following objection
has been often and &s;eriou&s;ly alledged. &startq;If it be mo&s;t a|greeable
to perfect wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, that we &s;hould re|ceive
what we de&s;ire, God, as perfectly, wi&s;e and ju&s;t,
will give it to us without a&s;king: if it be not agreeable to
the&s;e attributes of his nature, our intreaties cannot move
him to give it us; and it were impious to expect they
&s;hould.&endq; In fewer words, thus; &startq;If what we reque&s;t,
be fit for us, we &s;hall have it without praying; if it be
not &s;it for us, we cannot obtain it by praying.&endq; This ob|jection
admits but of one an&s;wer, namely, that it may be
agreeable to perfect wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, to grant that to
our prayers, which it would not have been agreeable to
perfect wi&s;dom to have given us without praying for.
But what virtue, you will a&s;k, is there in prayer, which
&s;hould make a favour con&s;i&s;tent with wi&s;dom, which would
not have been &s;o without it? To this que&s;tion, which
contains the whole difficulty attending the &s;ubject, the
following po&s;&s;ibilities are offered in reply.</P>
<P>1. A favour granted to prayer, may be more apt, on
that very account, to produce good effects upon the per&s;on
obliged. It may hold in the divine bounty, what experi|ence
has rai&s;ed into a proverb in the collation of human
<PB N="337" REF="375">
benefits, that what is obtained without a&s;king, is oft-times
received without gratitude.</P>
<P>2. It may be con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom of the Deity, to
with-hold his favours till they be a&s;ked for, as an expedient
to encourage devotion in his rational creation, in order
thereby to keep up and circulate a knowledge and &s;en&s;e
of their dependency upon <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>3. Prayer has a natural tendency to amend the petitioner
him&s;elf; and thus to bring him within the rules, which the
wi&s;dom of the Deity has pre&s;cribed to the di&s;pen&s;ation of his
favours.</P>
<P>If the&s;e, or any other a&s;&s;ignable &s;uppo&s;itions, &s;erve to
remove the apparent repugnancy between the &s;ucce&s;s of
prayer, and the character of the Deity, it is enough; for
the que&s;tion with the petitioner, is not from which, out of
many motives, God may grant his petition, or in what parti|cular
manner he is moved by the &s;upplications of his crea|tures;
but whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with his nature to be
moved at all, and whether there be any conceivable motives,
which may di&s;po&s;e the divine will to grant the petitioner
what he wants, in con&s;equence of his praying for it. It
is &s;ufficient for the petitioner that he gain his end. It is
not nece&s;&s;ary to devotion, perhaps not very con&s;i&s;tent with
it, that the circuit of cau&s;es, by which his prayers prevail,
&s;hould be known to the petitioner, much le&s;s that they
&s;hould be pre&s;ent to his imagination, at the time. All
that is nece&s;&s;ary, is, that there be no impo&s;&s;ibility appre|hended
in the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="376">
Thus much mu&s;t be conceded to the objection; that
prayer cannot rea&s;onably be offered to God with all the &s;ame
views, with which we oftentimes addre&s;s our intreaties to
men (and which views are not commonly or ea&s;ily &s;epa|rated
from it) viz. to inform them of our wants or de&s;ires;
to tea&s;e them out by importunity; to work upon their
indolence or compa&s;&s;ion, to per&s;uade them to do what
they ought to have done before, or ought not to do at all.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e there exi&s;ted a prince, who was known by
his &s;ubjects to act, of his own accord, always and invari|ably
for the be&s;t, the &s;ituation of a petitioner, who &s;oli|cited
a favor or pardon from &s;uch a prince, would &s;uffici|ciently
re&s;emble our's; and the que&s;tion with him, as with
us, would be, whether, the character of his prince being
con&s;idered, there remained any chance that he &s;hould ob|tain
from him by prayer, what he would not have re|ceived
without it? I do not conceive, that the character
of &s;uch a prince would nece&s;&s;arily exclude the effect of his
&s;ubjects prayers; for when that prince reflected, that the
earne&s;tne&s;s and humility of his &s;upplication had generated
an the &s;uppliant a frame of mind, upon which the par|don
or favour a&s;ked, would produce a permanent and ac|tive
&s;en&s;e of gratitude; that the granting of it to his pray|er,
would put others upon praying to him, and by that means
pre&s;erve to him the love and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ub|jects;
upon which love and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, their own happi|ne&s;s,
as well as his glory, depended: that be&s;ides, that the memory of the particular kindne&s;s would be heighten|ed
and prolonged by the anxiety with which it had been
<PB N="339" REF="377">
&s;ued for, prayer having, in other re&s;pects, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and
prepared the mind of the petitioner, as to render him ca|pable
of future &s;ervices, who before was unqualified for
any: might not that prince, I &s;ay, although he proceeded
upon no other con&s;iderations, than, the &s;trict rectitude and
expediency of the mea&s;ure, grant a favour or pardon to
<HI>this man,</HI> which he did not grant to <HI>another,</HI> who was too
proud, too lazy, or too bu&s;y, too indifferent whether he
received it or not, or too in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;overeign's ab|&s;olute
power to give or to with-hold it, ever to a&s;k for it;
or even to the <HI>philo&s;opher,</HI> who, from an opinion of the
fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of all addre&s;&s;es to a prince of the character
which he had formed to him&s;elf, refu&s;ed him&s;elf, and di&s;|couraged

of duty, or applications to the &s;overeign's
mercy or bounty; the di&s;u&s;e of which (&s;eeing affections

by a decay of loyalty and zeal among&s;t his &s;ubjects, and

he was to look for relief; and of his obligation to endeavour,
by future obedience, to render that being propitious to his
happine&s;s, in who&s;e hands, and at the di&s;po&s;al of who&s;e
mercy, he found him&s;elf to be.</P>

The objection to prayer &s;uppo&s;es, that a perfectly wi&s;e
being mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be inexorable; but where is the
proof, that <HI>inexorability</HI> is any part of perfect wi&s;dom;
e&s;pecially of that wi&s;dom, which is explained to con&s;i&s;t
in bringing about the mo&s;t beneficial ends by the wi&s;e&s;t
means?</P>
<P>The objection likewi&s;e a&s;&s;umes another principle, which
is attended with con&s;iderable difficulty and ob&s;curity,
namely, that upon every occa&s;ion, there is <HI>one,</HI> and only
<HI>one</HI> mode of action <HI>for the be&s;t;</HI> and that the divine will is
nece&s;&s;arily determined and confined to that mode: both
which po&s;itions pre&s;ume a knowledge of univer&s;al nature,
much beyond what we are capable of attaining. Indeed
when we apply to the divine nature &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as
the&s;e, &startq;God <HI>mu&s;t</HI> always do what is right,&endq; &startq;God <HI>can|not,</HI>
from the moral perfection and nece&s;&s;ity of his nature,
act otherwi&s;e than for the be&s;t,&endq; we ought to apply them
with much indeterminatene&s;s and re&s;erve; or rather we
mu&s;t confe&s;s, that there is &s;omething in the &s;ubject out of
the reach of our apprehen&s;ion: for to our apprehen&s;ion, to
be under a nece&s;&s;ity of acting according to any rule, is in|con&s;i&s;tent
with free agency; and it makes no difference,
that we can under&s;tand, whether the nece&s;&s;ity be internal or
external; or that the rule, is the rule of perfect recti|tude.</P>
<P>But efficacy is a&s;cribed to prayer, without the proof, we are told, which can alone, in &s;uch a &s;ubject produce con|viction,
<PB N="341" REF="379">
the confirmation of experience. Concerning the
appeal to experience, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with this re|mark,
that if prayer were &s;uffered to di&s;turb the order of
&s;econd cau&s;es appointed in the univer&s;e, too much, or to
produce its effect with the &s;ame regularity that they do,
it would introduce a change into human affairs, that in
&s;ome important re&s;pects would be evidently for the wor&s;e.
Who, for example, would labour, if his nece&s;&s;ities could
be &s;upplied with equal certainty by prayer? How few
would contain within any bounds of moderation, tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions
and plea&s;ures, which at pre&s;ent are checked only by
di&s;ea&s;e or the dread of it, if prayer would infallibly re&s;tore
health? In &s;hort, if the efficacy of prayer were &s;o con|&s;tant
and ob&s;ervable as to be relied upon <HI>before hand,</HI> it is
ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the conduct of mankind would, in pro|portion
to that reliance, become carele&s;s and di&s;orderly.
It is po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, that our prayers may,
in many in&s;tances, be efficacious, and yet our experience
of their efficacy be dubious and ob&s;cure. Therefore, if the
light of nature in&s;truct us by any other arguments to hope
for effect from prayer; &s;till more, if the &s;criptures autho|rize
the&s;e hopes by promi&s;es of acceptance; it &s;eems not
a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for calling in que&s;tion the reality of &s;uch
effects, that our ob&s;ervations of them are ambiguous: e&s;pe|cially,
&s;ince it appears probable, that this very ambiguity
is nece&s;&s;ary for the happine&s;s and &s;afety of human life.</P>
<P>But &s;ome, who&s;e objections do not exclude all prayer,
are offended with the mode of prayer in u&s;e among&s;t us,
<PB N="342" REF="380">
and with many of the &s;ubjects, which are almo&s;t univer|&s;ally
introduced into public wor&s;hip, and recommended to
private devotion. To pray for particular favours by name,
is to dictate, it has been &s;aid, to divine wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s:
to intercede for others, e&s;pecially for whole nations
and empires, is &s;till wor&s;e; it is to pre&s;ume that we po&s;&s;e&s;s
&s;uch an intere&s;t with the deity, as to be able, by our applica|tions,
to bend the mo&s;t important of his coun&s;els; and that the
happine&s;s of others, and even the pro&s;perity of whole com|munities,
is to depend upon this intere&s;t and our choice. Now
how unequal &s;oever our knowledge of the divine oeconomy
may be to the &s;olution of this difficulty which may require a
comprehen&s;ion of the entire plan, and of all the ends of God's
moral government to explain &s;atisfactorily, we can under|&s;tand
one thing concerning it, that it is after all, nothing
more, than making one man the in&s;trument of happine&s;s
and mi&s;ery to another; which is perfectly of a piece with
the cour&s;e and order, that obtain, and which we mu&s;t be|lieve,
were intended to obtain, in human affairs. Why
may we not be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prayers of other men, who are
beholden to their labour for our &s;upport? Why may not
our happine&s;s be made im &s;ome ca&s;es to depend upon the in|terce&s;&s;ion,
as it certainly does in many upon the good of|fices,
of our neighbours? The happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of
great number, we &s;ee oftentimes at the di&s;po&s;al of one
man's choice, or liable to be much affected by his conduct,
what greater difficulty is there in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the pray|ers
of an individual may avert a calamity from multitudes,
or be accepted to the benefit of whole communities?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty and Efficacy of Prayer, as repre&s;ented in Scrip|ture.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will have ob&s;erved, that the reflections
&s;tated in the preceding chapter, whatever truth
and weight they may be allowed to contain, ri&s;e many
of them no higher, than to negative arguments in favour
of the propriety of addre&s;&s;ing prayer to God. To prove
that the efficacy of prayers is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the at|tributes
of the Deity, does not prove that prayers are ac|tually
efficacious: and in the want of that unequivocal
te&s;timony, which experience alone could afford to this
point, but which we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and have &s;een good
rea&s;on why we are not to expect, the light of nature leaves
us to controverted probabilities, drawn from the impul&s;e
by which mankind have been almo&s;t univer&s;ally prompted
to devotion, and from &s;ome beneficial purpo&s;es, which, it
is conceived, may be better an&s;wered by the audience of
prayer, than by any other mode of communicating the
&s;ame ble&s;&s;ings. The revelations which we deem authentic,
completely &s;upply this defect of natural religion. They
require prayer to God as a duty; and they contain po&s;itive
a&s;&s;urances of its efficacy and acceptance. We could have
<PB N="344" REF="382">
no rea&s;onable motive for the exerci&s;e of prayer, without
believing that it may avail to the relief of our wants.
This belief, can only be founded, either in a &s;en&s;ible expe|rience
of the effect of prayer, or in promi&s;es of acceptance,
&s;ignified by divine authority. Our knowledge would have
come to us in the former way, le&s;s capable, indeed, of
doubt, but &s;ubjected to the abu&s;es and inconveniences
briefly de&s;cribed above: in the latter way, that is, by au|thorized
&s;ignifications of God's general di&s;po&s;ition to hear
and an&s;wer the devout &s;upplications of his creatures, we are
encouraged to pray, but not to place &s;uch a dependence
upon prayer, as might relax other obligations, or confound
the order of events and human expectations.</P>
<P>The &s;criptures not only affirm the propriety of prayer
in general, but furni&s;h precepts or examples which ju&s;tify
&s;ome topics and modes of prayer, which have been thought
exceptionable. And as the whole &s;ubject re&s;ts &s;o much
upon the foundation of &s;cripture, I &s;hall put down at
length texts applicable to the five following heads; to the
duty and efficacy of prayer in general; of prayer for par|ticular
favours by name; for public national ble&s;&s;ings; of

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of private Prayer, Family Prayer, and public Wor&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING the&s;e three de&s;criptions of devotion,
it is fir&s;t of all to be ob&s;erved, that they have each
their &s;eparate and peculiar u&s;e; and therefore, that the
exerci&s;e of one &s;pecies of wor&s;hip, however regular it be,
does not &s;uper&s;ede, or di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of either
of the other two.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Private prayer,</HI> is recommended for the &s;ake of the
following advantages:</P>
<P>Private wants cannot always be made the &s;ubjects of
public prayer; but whatever rea&s;on there is for praying
at all, there is the &s;ame, for making the &s;ore and grief of
each man's own heart the bu&s;ine&s;s of his application to
God. This mu&s;t be the office of private exerci&s;es of de|votion,
being imperfectly, if at all, practicable in any other.</P>
<P>Private prayer, is generally more hearty and in earne&s;t,
than the &s;hare we are capable of taking in joint acts of
wor&s;hip; becau&s;e it affords lei&s;ure and opportunity for the
circum&s;tantial recollection of tho&s;e per&s;onal wants, by the
<PB N="349" REF="387">
remembrance and ideas of which, the warmth and ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
of prayer is chiefly excited.</P>
<P>Private prayer, in proportion as it is u&s;ually accompa|nied
with more actual thought and reflection of the peti|tioner's
own, has a greater tendency than other modes of
devotion, to revive and fa&s;ten upon the mind the general
impre&s;&s;ions of religion. Solitude it&s;elf powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ts
this effect. When a man finds him&s;elf alone, in commu|nication
with his Creator, his imagination fills with a con|flux
of aweful ideas concerning the univer&s;al agency, and
invi&s;ible pre&s;ence of that being; concerning what is likely to
become of him&s;elf; and of the &s;uperlative importance of pro|viding
for the happine&s;s of his future exi&s;tence, by endea|vours
to pla&s;e <HI>him,</HI> who is the arbiter of his de&s;tiny: reflec|tions,
which, whenever they gain admittance, for a &s;ea|&s;on
overwhelm all others; and leave, when they depart,
a &s;olemnity upon the thoughts, that will &s;eldom fail, in
&s;ome degree, to affect the conduct of life.</P>
<P>Private prayer, thus recommended by its own propriety,
and by advantages not attainable in any form of religious
communion, receives a &s;uperior &s;anction from the autho|rity
and example of Chri&s;t. &startq;When thou praye&s;t, enter
into thy clo&s;et; and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut thy door,
pray to thy father which is in &s;ecret, and thy father
which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly.&endq;
&startq;And when he had &s;ent the multitudes away, he went
up into a mountain <HI>apart to pray.&endq; Mat.</HI> vi. 6. xiv. 23.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="388">
<HI>II.</HI> Family Prayer.</P>
<P>The peculiar u&s;e of family piety con&s;i&s;ts in its influence
upon &s;ervants, and the young members of a family, who
want &s;ufficient &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reflection to retire of their
own accord to the exerci&s;e of private devotion, and who&s;e
attention you cannot ea&s;ily command in public wor&s;hip.
The example al&s;o and authority of a father and ma&s;ter act
in this way with the greate&s;t force; for his private prayers,
to which his children and &s;ervants are not witne&s;&s;es, act
not at all upon them, as examples; and his attendance upon
public wor&s;hip, they will readily impute to fa&s;hion, to a
care to pre&s;erve appearances, to a concern for decency and
character, and to many motives be&s;ides a &s;en&s;e of duty to
God. Add to this, that forms of public wor&s;hip, in
proportion as they are more comprehen&s;ive, are always
le&s;s intere&s;ting than family prayers; and that the ardor of
devotion is better &s;upported, and the &s;ympathy more ea&s;ily
propagated, through a &s;mall a&s;&s;embly connected by the af|fections
of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, than in the pre&s;ence of a
mixed congregation.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> Public Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>If the wor&s;hip of God be a duty of religion, public
wor&s;hip is a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titution; fora&s;much as without
it, the greater part of mankind would exerci&s;e no religious
wor&s;hip at all.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="389">
The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies afford al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, oppor|tunities
for moral and religious in&s;truction to tho&s;e who
otherwi&s;e would receive none. In all prote&s;tant, and in
mo&s;t chri&s;tian countries, the elements of natural religion,
and the important parts of the evangelic hi&s;tory, are fa|miliar
to the lowe&s;t of the people. This competent degree
and general diffu&s;ion of religious knowledge among&s;t all
orders of chri&s;tians, which will appear a great thing, when
compared with the intellectual condition of barbarous na|tions,
can fairly, I think, be a&s;cribed to no other cau&s;e,
than the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of a&s;&s;emblies for divine wor|&s;hip;
in which, either portions of &s;cripture are recited and
explained, or the principles of chri&s;tian erudition are &s;o con|&s;tantly
taught in &s;ermons, incorporated with liturgies, or
expre&s;&s;ed in extempore prayer, as to imprint, by the very
repetition, &s;ome knowledge and memory of the&s;e &s;ubjects
upon the mo&s;t unqualified and carele&s;s hearer.</P>
<P>The two rea&s;ons above &s;tated, bind all the members of
a community to uphold public wor&s;hip by their pre&s;ence
and example, although the helps and opportunities it af|fords,
may not be nece&s;&s;ary to the devotion or edification
of all; and to &s;ome may be u&s;ele&s;s: for it is ea&s;ily fore|&s;een,
how &s;oon religious a&s;&s;emblies would fall into con|tempt
and di&s;u&s;e, if that cla&s;s of mankind, who are above
&s;eeking in&s;truction in them, and want not that their own
piety &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by either forms, or &s;ociety in de|votion,
were to withdraw their attendance; e&s;pecially
when it is con&s;idered, that all who plea&s;e, are at liberty to
<PB N="352" REF="390">
rank them&s;elves of this cla&s;s. This argument meets the
following, and the only &s;erious apology that is made for
the ab&s;enting of our&s;elves from public wor&s;hip. &startq;Surely I
may be excu&s;ed from going to church, &s;o long as I pray
at home, and have no rea&s;on to doubt but that my prayers
are equally acceptable and efficacious in my clo&s;et, as in a
cathedral; &s;till le&s;s can I think my&s;elf obliged to fit thro'
a tedious &s;ermon, in order to hear what is known already,
or better learnt from books, or &s;ugge&s;ted by meditation.&endq;
They, who&s;e qualifications and habits be&s;t &s;upply to them|&s;elves
all the effect of public ordinances, will be the la&s;t
to prefer this excu&s;e, when they reflect upon the <HI>general
con&s;equence</HI> of &s;etting up &s;uch an exemption, as well as the
<HI>turn</HI> which is &s;ure to be given in the neighbourhood, to their
ab&s;ence from public wor&s;hip. You &s;tay from church, to
employ the &s;abbath at home in exerci&s;es and &s;tudies &s;uited
to its proper bu&s;ine&s;s: your next neighbour &s;tays from
church, to &s;pend the &s;eventh day le&s;s religiou&s;ly than he
pa&s;&s;ed any of the &s;ix, in a &s;leepy, &s;tupid re&s;t, or at &s;ome
rendezvous of drunkenne&s;s and debauchery, and yet thinks
that he is only imitating you, becau&s;e you both agree in
not going to church. The &s;ame con&s;ideration &s;hould over|rule
many &s;mall &s;cruples, concerning the rigorous proprie|ty
of &s;ome things, which may be contained in the forms,
or admitted into the admini&s;tration of the public wor&s;hip
of our communion; for it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, that even
&startq;two or three &s;hould be gathered together,&endq; in any act
of &s;ocial wor&s;hip, if each one require from the re&s;t, an
implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his objections; and no man will at|tend
<PB N="353" REF="391">
upon a religious &s;ervice, which in any point contra|dicts
his opinion of truth, or falls &s;hort of his ideas of per|fection.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the direct nece&s;&s;ity of public wor&s;hip to the
greater part of every chri&s;tian community, &s;uppo&s;ing wor|&s;hip
at all to be a chri&s;tian duty, there are other valuable
advantages growing out of the u&s;e of religious a&s;&s;emblies,
without being de&s;igned in the in&s;titution, or thought of by
the individuals who compo&s;e them.</P>
<P>1. Joining in prayer and prai&s;es to their common crea|tor
and governor, has a &s;en&s;ible tendency to unite man|kind
together, and to cheri&s;h and enlarge the generous af|fections.</P>
<P>So many pathetic reflections are awakened by every ex|erci&s;e
of &s;ocial devotion, that mo&s;t men, I believe, carry
away from public wor&s;hip a better temper towards the re&s;t
of mankind, than they brought with them. Sprung from
the &s;ame extraction, preparing together for the period of all
worldly di&s;tinctions, reminded of their mutual infirmities
and common dependency, imploring and receiving &s;up|port
and &s;upplies from the &s;ame great &s;ource of power and
bounty, having all one intere&s;t to &s;ecure, one Lord to
&s;erve, one judgement, the &s;upreme object to all of their
hopes and fears, to look towards, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, in
this po&s;ition, to behold mankind as &s;trangers, competitors,
<PB N="354" REF="392">
or enemies, or not to regard them, as children of the &s;ame
family, a&s;&s;embled before their common parent, and with
&s;ome portion of the tenderne&s;s which belongs to the mo&s;t
endearing of our dome&s;tic relations. It is not to be ex|pected,
that any &s;ingle effect of this kind &s;hould be con&s;i|derable
or la&s;ting; but the frequent return of &s;uch senti|ments,
as the pre&s;ence of a devout congregation naturally
&s;ugge&s;ts, will gradually melt down the ruggedne&s;s of many
unkind pa&s;&s;ions, and may generate in time a permanent
and productive benevolence.</P>
<P>2. A&s;&s;emblies for the purpo&s;e of divine wor&s;hip, placing
men under impre&s;&s;ions, by which they are taught to con|&s;ider
their relation to the Deity, and to contemplate tho&s;e
around them with a view to that relation, force upon their
thoughts the natural equality of the human &s;pecies, and
thereby promote humility and conde&s;cen&s;ion in the highe&s;t
orders of the community, and in&s;pire the lowe&s;t with a
&s;en&s;e of their rights. The di&s;tinctions of civil life are al|mo&s;t
always in&s;i&s;ted upon too much, and urged too far.
Whatever therefore conduces to re&s;tore the level, by qua|lifying
the di&s;po&s;itions which grow out of great elevation or
depre&s;&s;ion of rank, improves the character on both &s;ides.
Now things are made to appear little, by being placed be|&s;ide
what is great. In which manner, &s;uperiorities, which
occupy the whole field of the imagination, will vani&s;h or
&s;hrink to their proper diminutivene&s;s, when compared with
the di&s;tance by which even the highe&s;t of men are removed
from the &s;upreme Being: and this compari&s;on is naturally
<PB N="355" REF="393">
introduced by all acts of joint wor&s;hip. If ever the poor
man holds up his head, it is at church; if ever the rich
man views him with re&s;pect, it is there; and both will be
the better, and the public profited, the oftener they meet
in a &s;ituation, in which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of dignity in the
one is tempered and mitigated, and the &s;pirit of the other
erected and confirmed. We recommend nothing adver&s;e to
&s;ubordinations, which are e&s;tabli&s;hed and nece&s;&s;ary; but
that it &s;hould be remembered, that &s;ubordination it&s;elf is
an evil, being an evil to the &s;ubordinate, who are the ma|jority,
and therefore ought not to be carried a tittle be|yond
what the greater good, the peaceable government of
the community, requires.</P>
<P>The public wor&s;hip of chri&s;tians is a duty of divine ap|pointment.
&startq;Where two or three,&endq; &s;ays Chri&s;t, &startq;are
gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t
of them.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 20. Heb. x. 25.</NOTE> This invitation will want nothing of the
force of a command with tho&s;e, who re&s;pect the per&s;on
and authority from which it proceeds. Again in the Epi&s;tle
to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> &startq;not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves
together as the manner of &s;ome is,&endq; which reproof &s;eems
as applicable to the de&s;ertion of our public wor&s;hip at this
day, as to the for&s;aking the religious a&s;&s;emblies of chri&s;tians
in the age of the apo&s;tle. Independently of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of
&s;cripture, a di&s;ciple of chri&s;tianity will hardly think him&s;elf
at liberty to di&s;pute a practice &s;et on foot by the in&s;pired
preachers of his religion, coeval with its in&s;titution, and re|tained
by every &s;ect into which it has been &s;ince divided.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Forms of Prayer in public Wor&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>LITURGIES, or preconcerted forms of public devo|tion,
being neither injoined nor forbidden in &s;crip|ture,
there can be no good rea&s;on for either receiving
or rejecting them, but that of expediency; which expe|diency,
is to be gathered from a compari&s;on of the advan|tages
and di&s;advantages attending upon this mode of wor|&s;hip,
with tho&s;e which u&s;ually accompany extemporary
prayer.</P>
<P>The advantages of a liturgy are the&s;e:</P>
<P>1. That it prevents ab&s;urd, extravagant, or impious ad|dre&s;&s;es
to God, which the folly and enthu&s;ia&s;m of many,
in an order of men &s;o numerous as the &s;acerdotal, mu&s;t
always be in danger of producing, where the conduct of
the public wor&s;hip is entru&s;ted, without re&s;traint or a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
to the di&s;cretion and abilities of the officiating mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="395">
2. That it prevents the <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> of extemporary prayer,
in which the congregation, being ignorant of each petition
before they hear it, and having little or no time to join in
it, after they have heard it, are confounded between their
attention to the mini&s;ter, and to their own devotion. The
devotion of the hearer is nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended, until a
petition be concluded; and before he can a&s;&s;ent to it, or
properly adopt it, that is, before he can addre&s;s the &s;ame
reque&s;t to God for him&s;elf, and from him&s;elf, his atten|tion
is called off to keep pace with what &s;ucceeds. Add
to this, that the mind of the hearer is held in continual
expectation, and detained from its proper bu&s;ine&s;s, by the
very novelty with which it is gratified. A congregation
may be plea&s;ed and affected with the prayers and devotion
of their mini&s;ter, without joining in them; in like manner
as an audience oftentimes are, with the repre&s;entation of
devotion upon the &s;tage, who, neverthele&s;s, come away, with|out
being con&s;cious, or conceiving, that they have exerci&s;ed
any act of devotion them&s;elves. <HI>Joint prayer,</HI> which is the
duty, and among&s;t all denominations of chri&s;tians the
declared de&s;ign of &startq;coming together,&endq; is prayer in which
all <HI>join;</HI> and not that which one alone in the congregation
conceives and delivers, and of which the re&s;t are merely
hearers. This objection &s;eems fundamental; and holds,
even where the mini&s;ter's office is di&s;charged with every
po&s;&s;ible advantage and accompli&s;hment. The labouring re|collection,
and embarra&s;&s;ed or tumultuous delivery, of many
extempore &s;peakers, form an additional objection to this
mode of public wor&s;hip; for the&s;e imperfections are very
<PB N="358" REF="396">
general, and give great pain to the &s;erious part of a congre|gation,
as well as afford a profane diver&s;ion to the levity
of the other part.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages of a liturgy are connected with two
principal inconveniences; fir&s;t, that forms of prayer com|po&s;ed
in one age, become unfit for another, by the una|voidable
change of language, circum&s;tances, and opinions;
&s;econdly, that the perpetual repetition of the &s;ame form of
words, produces wearine&s;s and inattentivene&s;s in the con|gregation.
However both the&s;e inconveniences are, in
their nature, vincible. Occa&s;ional revi&s;ions of a liturgy
may obviate the fir&s;t; and devotion will &s;upply a remedy
for the &s;econd. Or they may both &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a con&s;iderable
degree, and yet be outweighed by the objections which are
in&s;eparable from extemporary prayer.</P>
<P>The Lord's prayer is a precedent, as well as a pattern
for forms of prayer. Our Lord appears, if not to have
pre&s;cribed, at lea&s;t to have authori&s;ed the u&s;e of fixed forms,
when he complied with the reque&s;t of the di&s;ciple who
&s;aid unto him, &startq;Lord, teach us to pray, as <HI>John</HI> al&s;o
taught his disciples.&endq; <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 1.</P>
<P>The properties required in a public liturgy, are, that it
be compendious; that it expre&s;s ju&s;t conceptions of the
divine attributes; that it recite &s;uch wants as the congre|gation
are likely to feel, and no other; and that it
contain as few contraverted propo&s;itions, as may be.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="397">
1. That it be compendious.</P>
<P>It were no difficult ta&s;k, to contract the liturgies of mo&s;t
churches into half their pre&s;ent compa&s;s, and yet retain
every di&s;tinct petition, as well the &s;ub&s;tance of every &s;en|timent,
which can be found in them. But brevity may
be &s;tudied too much. The compo&s;er of a liturgy mu&s;t not
&s;it down to his work, with, the hope, that the devotion of
the congregation will be uniformly &s;u&s;tained throughout,
or that every part will be attended to by every hearer. If
this could be depended upon, a very &s;hort &s;ervice would be
&s;ufficient for every purpo&s;e that can be an&s;wered or de|&s;igned
by &s;ocial wor&s;hip; but &s;eeing the attention of mo&s;t
men is apt to wander and return, at intervals, and by
&s;tarts, he will admit a certain degree of amplification and
repetition, of diver&s;ity of expre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ame &s;ubject,
and variety of phra&s;e and form, with little addition to the
&s;en&s;e, to the end that the attention which has been &s;lum|bering
or ab&s;ent, during one part of the &s;ervice, may be
excited and recalled by another; and the assembly kept
together, until it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed that the
mo&s;t heedle&s;s and inadvertent have performed &s;ome act of
devotion, and the mo&s;t de&s;ultory attention been caught by
&s;ome part or other of the public &s;ervice. On the other
hand, the too great length of church &s;ervices is more un|favourable
to piety, than almo&s;t any fault of compo&s;ition
can be. It begets in many an early and unconquerable
di&s;like to the public wor&s;hip of their country or commu|nion.
They come to church &s;eldom; and enter the doors
<PB N="360" REF="398">
of one, under the apprehen&s;ion of a tedious attendance, which
they prepare for at fir&s;t, or &s;oon after relieve, by compo&s;ing
them&s;elves to a drow&s;y forgetfulne&s;s of the place and duty,
or by &s;ending abroad their thoughts in &s;earch of more amu&s;ing
occupation. Although there may be &s;ome few of a di&s;po&s;ition
not to be wearied with religious exerci&s;es, yet, where a
ritual is prolix, and the celebration of divine &s;ervice long,
no effect is, in general, to be looked for, but that indo|lence
will find in it an excu&s;e, and piety be di&s;concerted
by impatience.</P>
<P>The length and repetitions complained of in our liturgy,
are not &s;o much the fault of the compilers, as the effect
of uniting into <HI>one</HI> &s;ervice, what was originally, but with
very little regard to the conveniency of the people, di&s;|tributed
into <HI>three.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding that dread of inno|vation,
which &s;eems to have become the <HI>panic</HI> of the age,
few, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, would be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch
omi&s;&s;ions, abridgements, or change in the arrangement,
as the combination of &s;eparate &s;ervices mu&s;t needs require,
even &s;uppo&s;ing each to have been faultle&s;s in it&s;elf. If to|gether
with the&s;e alterations, the Epi&s;tles and Go&s;pels, and
Collects which precede them, were compo&s;ed and &s;elected
with more regard to unity of &s;ubject and de&s;ign; and the
p&s;alms and le&s;&s;ons, either left to the choice of the mini&s;ter,
or better accommodated to the capacity of the audience,
and the edification of modern life; the church of <HI>England</HI>
would be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a liturgy, in which tho&s;e who
a&s;&s;ent to her doctrines, would have little to blame, and the
<PB N="361" REF="399">
mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied mu&s;t acknowledge many beauties. The
&s;tile throughout is excellent; calm, without coldne&s;s;
and though every where &s;edate, oftentimes affecting.
The pau&s;es in the &s;ervice are di&s;po&s;ed at proper intervals.
The tran&s;itions from one office of devotion to another,
from confe&s;&s;ion to prayer, from prayer to thank&s;giving,
from thank&s;giving to &startq;hearing of the word,&endq; are con|trived
like &s;cenes in the drama, to &s;upply the mind
with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of diver&s;ified engagements. As much
variety is introduced al&s;o into the form of praying, as this
kind of compo&s;ition &s;eems capable of admitting. The pray|er
at one time is continued, at another, broken by re&s;pon&s;es,
or ca&s;t into &s;hort alternate ejaculations; and &s;ometimes
the congregation are called upon to take their &s;hare in the
&s;ervice, by being left to complete a &s;entence which the
mini&s;ter had begun. The enumeration of human wants
and &s;ufferings in the litany, is almo&s;t complete. A chri&s;|tian
petitioner can have few things to a&s;k or deprecate of
God, which he will not find there expre&s;&s;ed, and for the
mo&s;t part, with inimitable tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>II. That it expre&s;s ju&s;t conceptions of the divine at|tributes.</P>
<P>This is an article in which no care can be too great. The
popular notions of God, are formed, in a great mea&s;ure,
from the accounts which the people receive of his nature
and character, in their religious a&s;&s;emblies. An error here,
becomes the error of multitudes: and as it is a &s;ubject, in
<PB N="362" REF="400">
which almo&s;t every opinion leads the way to &s;ome practical
conclu&s;ion, the purity or depravation of public manners,
will be affected, among&s;t other cau&s;es, by the truth or
corruption of the public forms of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>III. That it recite &s;uch wants as the congregation are
likely to feel, and no other.</P>
<P>Of forms of prayer, which offend not egregiou&s;ly again&s;t
truth and decency, that has the mo&s;t merit, which is be&s;t
calculated to keep alive the devotion of the a&s;&s;embly. It were
to be wi&s;hed therefore, that every part of a liturgy were
per&s;onally applicable to every individual in the congrega|tion;
and that nothing were introduced to interrupt the pa&s;|&s;ion,
or damp a flame, which it is not ea&s;y to rekindle.
Upon this principle, the <HI>&s;tate prayers</HI> in our liturgy,
&s;hould be fewer and &s;horter. Whatever may be pre|tended,
the congregation do not feel that concern in
the &s;ubject of the&s;e prayers, which mu&s;t be felt, or ever
prayer be made to God with earne&s;tne&s;s. The <HI>&s;tate &s;tile</HI>
likewi&s;e &s;eems un&s;ea&s;onably introduced into the&s;e prayers,
as ill-according with that annihilation of human greatne&s;s,
of which, every act, that carries the mind to God, pre|&s;ents
the idea.</P>
<P>IV. That it contain as few contraverted propo&s;itions, as
may be.</P>
<P>We allow to each church the truth of its peculiar tenets,
and all the importance which zeal can a&s;cribe to them.
<PB N="363" REF="401">
We di&s;pute not here the right, or the expediency of fram|ing
creeds, or impo&s;ing &s;ub&s;criptions. But why &s;hould
every po&s;ition, which a church maintains, be woven with
&s;o much indu&s;try into her forms of public wor&s;hip? Some
are offended, and &s;ome are excluded; this is an evil in it|&s;elf,
at lea&s;t to <HI>them;</HI> and what advantage or &s;atisfaction
can be derived to the <HI>re&s;t,</HI> from the &s;eparation of their bre|thren,
it is difficult to imagine; unle&s;s it were a duty,
to publi&s;h our &s;y&s;tem of polemic divinity, under the name
of making confe&s;&s;ion of our faith, every time we wor&s;hip
God; or a &s;in, to agree in religious exerci&s;es with tho&s;e, from
whom we differ in &s;ome religious opinions. Indeed, where
one man thinks it his duty, con&s;tantly to wor&s;hip a being,
whom another cannot, with the a&s;&s;ent of his con&s;cience,
permit him&s;elf to wor&s;hip at all, there &s;eems to be no
place for comprehen&s;ion, or any expedient left, but a quiet
&s;ece&s;&s;ion. All other differences may be compromi&s;ed by
&s;ilence. If &s;ects and &s;chi&s;ms be an evil, they are as much
to be avoided by one &s;ide as the other. If &s;ectaries are
blamed for taking unnece&s;&s;ary offence, e&s;tabli&s;hed churches
are no le&s;s culpable for unnece&s;&s;arily giving it; or bound
at lea&s;t to produce a command, or a rea&s;on of equivalent
utility, for &s;hutting out any from their communion, by
mixing with divine wor&s;hip, doctrines, whether true or
fal&s;e, unconnected, in their nature, with devotion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the U&s;e of Sabbatical In&s;titutions.</HEAD>
<P>AN a&s;&s;embly cannot be collected, unle&s;s the time of
a&s;&s;embling be fixed and known before hand; and
if the de&s;ign of the a&s;&s;embly require, that it be held fre|quently,
it is ea&s;ie&s;t that it &s;hould return at &s;tated intervals.
This produces a nece&s;&s;ity of appropriating &s;et &s;ea&s;ons to
the &s;ocial offices of religion. It is al&s;o highly convenient,
that the &s;ame &s;ea&s;ons be <HI>ob&s;erved</HI> throughout the country,
that all may be employed, or all at lei&s;ure together; for,
if the rece&s;s from worldly occupation be not general, one
man's bu&s;ine&s;s will perpetually interfere with another man's
devotion; the buyer will be calling at the &s;hop, when the
&s;eller is gone to church. This part, therefore, of the
religious di&s;tinction of &s;ea&s;ons, namely, a general inter|mi&s;&s;ion
of labour and bu&s;ine&s;s, during times, previou&s;ly
&s;et apart for the exerci&s;e of public wor&s;hip, is founded in
the rea&s;ons which make public wor&s;hip it&s;elf a duty. But
the celebration of divine &s;ervice never occupies the whole
day. What remains, therefore, of Sunday, be&s;ide the
part of it employed at church, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a
mere re&s;t from the ordinary occupations of civil life; and
he who would defend the in&s;titution, as it is required to
<PB N="365" REF="403">
be ob&s;erved in chri&s;tian countries, unle&s;s he can produce a
command for a <HI>chri&s;tian &s;abbath,</HI> mu&s;t point out the u&s;es of
it in that view.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, that interval of relaxation, which Sunday af|fords
to the laborious part of mankind, contributes greatly
to the comfort and &s;atisfaction of their lives, both as it re|fre&s;hes
them for the time, and as it relieves their &s;ix days
labour, by the pro&s;pect of a day of re&s;t always approach|ing;
which could not be &s;aid of <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> indulgences of lei|&s;ure
and re&s;t, even were they more frequent, than there is
rea&s;on to expect they would be, if left to the di&s;cretion or
humanity of intere&s;ted ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. To this difference
between the two, it may be added, that holydays which
come &s;eldom, and unexpected, are unprovided when they
do come, with any duty or employment, and the manner
of &s;pending them being regulated by no public decency or
e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age, they are commonly con&s;umed in rude,
if not criminal pa&s;times, in a &s;tupid &s;loth, or bruti&s;h in|temperance.
Whoever con&s;iders how much &s;abbatical in|&s;titutions
conduce, in this re&s;pect, to the happine&s;s and
civilization of the labouring cla&s;&s;es of mankind, and re|flects
how great a majority of the human &s;pecies the&s;e
cla&s;&s;es compo&s;e, will acknowledge the utility, whatever
he may believe of the origin of this di&s;tinction; and will,
con&s;equently, perceive it to be every man's duty to uphold
the ob&s;ervation of Sunday, when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, let the
e&s;tabli&s;hment have proceeded from whom, or what autho|rity
it will.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="404">
Nor is there any thing lo&s;t to the community by the
intermi&s;&s;ion of public indu&s;try, one day in the week.
For in countries tolerably advanced in population, and the
arts of civil life, there is always enough of human labour,
and to &s;pare. The difficulty is not &s;o much to procure,
as to employ it. The addition of the &s;eventh day's labour
to that of the other &s;ix, would have no other effect, than
to reduce the price. The labourer him&s;elf, who de&s;erved
and &s;uffered mo&s;t by the change, would gain nothing.</P>
<P>2. Sunday, by &s;u&s;pending many public diver&s;ions, and
the ordinary rotation of employment, leaves to men of all
ranks and profe&s;&s;ions, &s;ufficient lei&s;ure, and not more
than what is &s;ufficient, for both the external offices of
chri&s;tianity, and the retired, but equally nece&s;&s;ary duties
of religious meditation and enquiry. It is true, that many
do not convert their lei&s;ure to this purpo&s;e; but it is of
moment, and is all which a public constitution can effect,
that to every one be allowed the opportunity.</P>
<P>3. They, who&s;e humanity embraces the whole &s;en&s;itive
creation, will e&s;teem it no incon&s;iderable recommendation
of a we$kly return of public re&s;t, that it affords a re&s;pite
to the toil of brutes. Nor can we omit to recount this
among&s;t the u&s;es, which the divine founder of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
&s;abbath, expre&s;sly appointed a law of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>We admit, that none of the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;how why Sunday
&s;hould be preferred to any other day in the week, or one

day in &s;even, to one day in &s;ix or eight; but the&s;e points,
which, in their nature, are of arbitrary determination,
being e&s;tabli&s;hed to our hands, our obligation applies to

<P>THE &s;ubject, &s;o far as it makes any part of chri&s;tian
morality, is contained in two que&s;tions:</P>
<P>I. Whether the command, by which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;abbath
was in&s;tituted, extend to chri&s;tians?</P>
<P>II. Whether any new command was delivered by Chri&s;t;
or any other day &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
&s;abbath, by the authority or example of his Apo&s;tles?</P>
<P>In treating of the fir&s;t que&s;tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to
collect the accounts, which are pre&s;erved of the in&s;titu|tion
in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory; for the &s;eeing the&s;e accounts
together, and in one point of view, will be the be&s;t pre|paration
<PB N="368" REF="406">
for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing or judging of any arguments on
one &s;ide or the other.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> the hi&s;torian having
concluded his account of the &s;ix days creation, proceeds
thus: &startq;And on the &s;eventh day God ended his work
which he had made; and he re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day
from all his work which he had made: and God
<HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> the &s;eventh day, and <HI>&s;anctified it,</HI> becau&s;e that in
it he had re&s;ted from all his work which God created
and made.&endq; After this, we hear no more of the &s;abbath,
or of the &s;eventh day, as in any manner di&s;tingui&s;hed from
the other &s;ix, until the hi&s;tory bring us down to the &s;o|journing
of the <HI>Jews</HI> in the wilderne&s;s, when the following
remarkable pa&s;&s;age occurs. Upon the complaint of the peo|ple
for want of food, God was plea&s;ed to provide for their
relief by a miraculous &s;upply of manna, which was found
every morning upon the ground about the camp, when
the dew went off, &startq;and they gathered it every morning,
every man according to his eating; and when the &s;un
waxed hot, it melted: and it came to pa&s;s, that on
the &s;ixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two
omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congre|gation
came and told <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and he &s;aid unto them,
this is that which the Lord hath &s;aid, <HI>tomorrow, is the
re&s;t of the holy &s;abbath unto the Lord,</HI> bake that which ye
will bake, to day, and &s;eethe that ye will &s;eethe, and
that which remaineth over lay up for you, to be kept
until the morning; and they laid it up till the morn|ing,
<PB N="369" REF="407">
as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> bade,&endq; and it did not &s;tink (as it had done
before, when &s;ome of them left it till the morning)
&startq;neither was there any worm therein. And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid,
Eat that to day; <HI>for to day is a &s;abbath unto the Lord:</HI>
to day ye &s;hall not find it in the field. Six days ye &s;hall
gather it, but on the &s;eventh day, which is the &s;abbath,
in it there &s;hall be none. And it came to pa&s;s, that
there went out &s;ome of the people on the &s;eventh day
for to gather, and they found none. And the Lord
&s;aid unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how long refu&s;e ye to keep my com|mandments
and my laws? See, for <HI>that the Lord hath
given you the &s;abbath,</HI> therefore he giveth you on the &s;ixth
day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his
place, let no man go but of his place on the &s;eventh day,
&s;o the people re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day.&endq; <HI>Exodus</HI>
xvi.</P>
<P>Not long after this, the &s;abbath, as is well known,
was e&s;tabli&s;hed with great &s;olemnity in the fourth com|mandment.</P>
<P>Now, in my opinion, the tran&s;action in the wilderne&s;s,
above recited, was the fir&s;t actual in&s;titution of the &s;ab|bath.
For, if the &s;abbath had been in&s;tituted at the time of
the creation, as the words in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> may &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight
to import, and ob&s;erved all along, from that time to the
departure of the <HI>Jews</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> a period of about
two thou&s;and five hundred years; it appears unaccountable,
that no mention of it, no occa&s;ion of even the ob&s;cure&s;t al|lu&s;ion
<PB N="370" REF="408">
to it, &s;hould occur, neither in the general hi&s;tory of
the world before the call of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which contains, we
admit, only a few memoirs of its early ages, and tho&s;e
extremely abridged; nor, which is more to be wondered at,
in that of the lives of the three fir&s;t <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> patriarchs,
which, in many parts of the account, is &s;ufficiently cir|cum&s;tantial
and dome&s;tic. Nor is there, in the pa&s;&s;age
above quoted from the &s;ixteenth chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> any in|timation
that the &s;abbath, then appointed to be ob&s;erved,
was only the revival of an ancient in&s;titution, which had
been neglected, forgotten, or &s;u&s;pended; nor is any &s;uch
neglect imputed either to the inhabitants of the old world,
or to any part of the family of <HI>Noah;</HI> nor la&s;tly, is any
permi&s;&s;ion recorded to di&s;pen&s;e with the in&s;titution during
the captivity of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or on any other public
emergency.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age in the &s;econd chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> which cre|ates
the whole controver&s;y upon the &s;ubject, is not incon|&s;i&s;tent
with this opinion; for as the &s;eventh day was erected
into a &s;abbath, on account of God's re&s;ting upon that day
from the work of the creation, it was natural enough in
the hi&s;torian, when he had related the hi&s;tory of the crea|tion,
and of God's cea&s;ing from it on the &s;eventh day, to
add, &startq;and God ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day, and &s;anctified it,
becau&s;e that on it he had re&s;ted from all his work which
God created and made;&endq; although the &startq;ble&s;&s;ing&endq; and
&startq;&s;anctification,&endq; i. e. the religious di&s;tinction and appro|priation
of that day, was not actually made till many
<PB N="371" REF="409">
ages afterwards. The words do not a&s;&s;ert, that God <HI>then</HI>
&startq;ble&s;&s;ed&endq; and &startq;&s;anctified&endq; the &s;eventh day, but that he
ble&s;&s;ed and &s;anctified it <HI>for that rea&s;on;</HI> and if any a&s;k, why
the &s;abbath, or &s;anctification of the &s;eventh day, was <HI>then</HI>
mentioned, if it was not <HI>then</HI> appointed, the an&s;wer is at
hand, the order of connection, and not of time, intro|duced
the mention of the &s;abbath, in the hi&s;tory of the
&s;ubject which it was ordained to commemorate.</P>
<P>This interpretation is &s;trongly &s;upported by a pa&s;&s;age in
the prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> where the &s;abbath is plainly &s;poken
of as <HI>given,</HI> and what el&s;e pan that mean, but as <HI>fir&s;t in|stituted,</HI>
in the wilderne&s;s? &startq;Wherefore I cau&s;ed them
to go forth out of the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and brought them
into the wilderne&s;s, and I gave them my &s;tatutes and
&s;hewed them my judgements, which if a man do, he
&s;hall even live in them; moreover, al&s;o <HI>I gave them my
&s;abbaths,</HI> to be a &s;ign between me and them, that they
might know that I am the Lord that &s;anctify them.&endq;
<HI>Ezek.</HI> xx. 10, 11, 12.</P>
<P><HI>Nehemiah</HI> al&s;o recounts the promulgation of the &s;abbatic
law among&s;t the tran&s;actions in the wilderne&s;s; which
&s;upplies another con&s;iderable argument in aid of our opi|nion:
&startq;Moreover thou ledde&s;t them in the day by a
cloudy pillar, and in the night by a pillar of fire, to
give them light in the way wherein they &s;hould go.
Thou came&s;t down al&s;o upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and &s;pake&s;t
with them from heaven, and gave&s;t them right judge|ments
<PB N="372" REF="410">
and true laws, good &s;tatutes and commandments,
<HI>and made&s;t known unto them thy holy &s;abbath,</HI> and com|manded&s;t
them precepts, &s;tatutes and laws by the hand
of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> thy &s;ervant, and gave&s;t them bread from hea|ven
for their hunger, and broughte&s;t forth water for
them out of the rock.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">From the mention of the &s;abbath in &s;o clo&s;e a connection with the de&s;cent of God upon mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and the delivery of the law from thence, one would be inclined to believe, that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> referred &s;olely to the fourth commandment. But the fourth commandment certainly did not fir&s;t make known the &s;abbath. And it is apparent, that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> ob&s;erved not the order of events, for he &s;peaks of what pa&s;&s;ed upon mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> before he mentions the miraculous &s;upplies of bread and water, though the <HI>Jews</HI> did not arrive at mount <HI>Sinai</HI> till long after both the&s;e miracles were wrought.</NOTE> <HI>Nehem.</HI> ix. 12.</P>
<P>If it be enquired, what duties were appointed for the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;abbath, and under what penalties, and in what
manner it was ob&s;erved among&s;t the ancient <HI>Jews;</HI> we
find that, by the fourth commandment, a &s;trict ce&s;&s;ation
from work was enjoined, not only upon <HI>Jews</HI> by birth,
or religious profe&s;&s;ion, but upon all who re&s;ided within the
limits of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tate; that the &s;ame was to be per|mitted
to their &s;laves and their cattle; that this re&s;t was
not to be violated under pain of death: &startq;Who&s;oever
doeth any work in the &s;abbath day, he &s;hall &s;urely be
put to death.&endq; <HI>Ex.</HI> xxxi. 14. Be&s;ides which the &s;eventh
day was to be &s;olemnized by double &s;acrifices in the temple;
&startq;And on the &s;abbath day <HI>two</HI> lambs of the fir&s;t year with|out
&s;pot, and two tenth deals of floor for a meat of|fering,
<PB N="373" REF="411">
mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof,
this is the burnt offering of every &s;abbath, be&s;ide the
continual burnt offering and his drink offering.&endq; <HI>Numb.</HI>
xxviii. 9, 10. Al&s;o holy convocations, or a&s;&s;emblies for
the purpo&s;e, we pre&s;ume, of public wor&s;hip or religious
in&s;truction, were directed to be held on the &s;abbath day,
&startq;the &s;eventh day is a &s;abbath of re&s;t, <HI>an holy convocation.&endq;
Lev.</HI> xxiii. 3.</P>
<P>And accordingly we read, that the &s;abbath was in fact
ob&s;erved among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> by a &s;crupulous ab&s;tinence
from every thing that, by any po&s;&s;ible con&s;truction, could
be deemed labour; as from dre&s;&s;ing meat, from travelling
beyond a &s;abbath day's journey, or about a &s;ingle mile.
In the <HI>Maccabean</HI> wars, they &s;uffered a thou&s;and of their
number to be &s;lain, rather than do any thing on the &s;ab|bath
day, in their own defence. In the final &s;iege of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
after they had &s;o far overcome their &s;cruples, as
to defend their per&s;ons when attacked, they refu&s;ed any
operation on the &s;abbath day, by which they might have
interrupted the enemy in filling up the trench. After the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ynagogues, (of the origin of which we
have no account) it was the cu&s;tom to a&s;&s;emble in them
upon the &s;abbath day, for the purpo&s;e of hearing the law
rehear&s;ed and explained, and for the exerci&s;e, it is probable,
of public devotion. &startq;For <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of old time hath in
every city, them that preach him, <HI>being read in the &s;yna|gogues
every &s;abbath day.</HI>&endq; The &s;eventh day is <HI>Saturday;</HI>
and agreeably to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> way of computing the day,
<PB N="374" REF="412">
the &s;abbath held from &s;ix o'clock on the Friday evening,
to &s;ix o'clock on Saturday afternoon.&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;ervations
being premi&s;ed, we approach the main question, "Whe|ther
the command, by which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;abbath was in|&s;lituted,
extend to us?</P>
<P>If the divine command was actually delivered at the cre|ation,
it was addre&s;&s;ed, no doubt, to the whole human
&s;pecies alike, and continues, unle&s;s repealed by &s;ome &s;ub|&s;equent
revelation, binding upon all who come to the
knowledge of it. If the command was publi&s;hed for the
fir&s;t time in the wilderne&s;s, then it was directed to the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people alone; and &s;omething farther, either in the
&s;ubject, or circum&s;tances of the command, will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;how, that it was de&s;igned for any other. It is
on this account, that the que&s;tion concerning the date
of the in&s;titution was fir&s;t to be con&s;idered. The former
opinion precludes all debate about the extent of the obliga|tion;
the latter admits, and, <HI>prim&acirc; facie,</HI> induces a be|lief,
that the &s;abbath ought to be con&s;idered as part of
the peculiar law of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> policy.</P>
<P>Which belief receives great confirmation from the fol|lowing
arguments.</P>
<P>The &s;abbath is de&s;cribed as a &s;ign between God and the
people of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> &startq;Wherefore the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hall
keep the &s;abbath, to ob&s;erve the &s;abbath throughout
their generations, for a perpetual covenant; <HI>it is a &s;ign
<PB N="375" REF="413">
between me and the children of I&s;rael for ever.&endq; Exodus</HI>
xxxi. 16, 17. Again, &startq;And I gave them my &s;tatutes
and &s;hewed them my judgements, which, if a man do,
he &s;hall even live in them; <HI>moreover al&s;o I gave them
my &s;abbaths to be a &s;ign between me and them,</HI> that they
might know that I am the Lord that &s;anctify them.&endq;
<HI>Ezek.</HI> xx. 12. Now it does not &s;eem ea&s;y to under&s;tand
how the &s;abbath could be a <HI>&s;ign</HI> between God and the
people of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> unle&s;s the ob&s;ervance of it was peculiar
to that people, and de&s;igned to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction of the &s;abbath is, in its nature, as much
a po&s;itive ceremonial in&s;titution, as that of many other
&s;ea&s;ons which were appointed by the levitical law to be kept
holy, and ob&s;erved by a &s;trict re&s;t; as the fir&s;t and &s;eventh
days of unleavened bread; the fea&s;t of penteco&s;t; the fea&s;t
of tabernacles; and in the twenty third chapter of <HI>Exo|dus,</HI>
the &s;abbath and the&s;e are recited together.</P>
<P>If the command by which the &s;abbath was in&s;tituted,
be binding upon chri&s;tians, it mu&s;t bind as to the day,
the duties, and the penalty; in none of which it is re|ceived.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath was not one of the ar|ticles
enjoined by the Apo&s;tles, in the fifteenth chapter of
<HI>Acts,</HI> upon them, &startq;which, from among the Gentiles, were turned unto God.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="414">
St. <HI>Paul</HI> evidently appears to have con&s;idered the &s;abbath,
as part of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ritual, not binding upon Chri&s;tians
as &s;uch: &startq;Let no man therefore judge you in meat or
in drink, or in re&s;pect of an holy day, or of the new
moon, or <HI>of the &s;abbath days,</HI> which are a &s;hadow of
things to come, but the body is of Chri&s;t.&endq; <HI>Col.</HI> ii.
16, 17.</P>
<P>I am aware of only two objections which can be oppo&s;ed
to the force of the&s;e arguments: one is, that the rea&s;on
a&s;&s;igned in the fourth commandment for hallowing the
&s;eventh day, namely, &startq;becau&s;e God re&s;ted on the &s;e|venth
day from the work of the creation,&endq; is a rea&s;on
which pertains to all mankind; the other, that the com|mand,
which injoins the ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath, is
in&s;erted in the decalogue, of which all the other precepts
and prohibitions are of moral and univer&s;al obligation.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t objection it may be remarked, that al|though
in <HI>Exodus</HI> the commandment is founded upon God's
re&s;t from the creation, in <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> the commandment
is repeated with a reference to a different event: &startq;Six
days &s;halt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the
&s;eventh day is the &s;abbath of the Lord thy God; in it
thou &s;halt not do any work, thou, nor thy &s;on, nor
thy daughter, nor thy man-&s;ervant, nor thy maid-&s;er|vant,
nor thine ox, nor thine a&s;s, nor any of thy
cattle, nor thy &s;tranger that is within thy gates, that
thy man-&s;ervant and thy maid-&s;ervant may re&s;t as well
<PB N="377" REF="415">
as thou; and remember that thou wa&s;t a &s;ervant in the
land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought
thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and by a
&s;tretched-out arm; <HI>therefore</HI> the Lord thy God com|manded
thee to keep the &s;abbath day.&endq; It is farther
ob&s;ervable, that God's re&s;t from the creation is propo&s;ed
as the rea&s;on of the in&s;titution, even where the in&s;titution
it&s;elf is &s;poken of as peculiar to the Jews:&mdash;&startq;Wherefore
the children of I&s;rael &s;hall keep the &s;abbath, to ob&s;erve
the &s;abbath throughout their generations, for a perpe|tual
covenant: it is a &s;ign between me and the children
of I&s;rael for ever; <HI>for</HI> in &s;ix days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and on the &s;eventh day he re&s;ted and was
refre&s;hed.&endq; The truth is, the&s;e different rea&s;ons were
a&s;&s;igned to account for different circum&s;tances in the com|mand.
If a Jew enquired, why the <HI>&s;eventh day</HI> was &s;anc|tified
rather than the &s;ixth or eighth, his law told him
becau&s;e God re&s;ted on the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> day from the creation.
If he a&s;ked, why was the &s;ame re&s;t indulged to <HI>&s;laves?</HI>
his law bid him remember, that he al&s;o was a <HI>&s;lave</HI> in the
land of Egypt; and &startq;that the Lord his God brought
him out thence.&endq; In this view, the two rea&s;ons are per|fectly
compatible with each other, and with a third end
of the in&s;titution, its being a <HI>&s;ign</HI> between God and the
people of I&s;rael; but in this view they determine nothing
concerning the extent of the obligation. If the reason by
its proper energy had con&s;tituted a natural obligation,
or if it had been mentioned with a view to the extent of
the obligation, we &s;hould &s;ubmit to the conclu&s;ion, that
<PB N="378" REF="416">
all were comprehended by the command, who are con|cerned
in the rea&s;on. But the &s;abbatic re&s;t being a duty
which re&s;ults from the ordination and authority of a po&s;i|tive
law, the rea&s;on can be alledged no farther than as it
explains the de&s;ign of the legi&s;lator; and if it appear to be
recited with an intentional application to one part of the
law, it can explain his de&s;ign upon no other.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd objection, that ina&s;much as
the other nine commandments are confe&s;&s;edly of moral
and univer&s;al obligation, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed
that this is of the &s;ame;&mdash;we an&s;wer, that this argument
will have little weight, when it is con&s;idered, that the
di&s;tinction between po&s;itive and natural duties, like other
di&s;tinctions of modern ethics, was unknown to the &s;impli|city
of ancient language; and that there are various pa&s;|&s;ages
in &s;cripture, in which duties of a political, or cere|monial,
or po&s;itive nature, and confe&s;&s;edly of partial
obligation, are enumerated, and without any mark of di&s;|crimination,
along with others which are natural and
univer&s;al. Of this the following is an inconte&s;tible exam|ple:
&startq;But if a man be ju&s;t, and do that which is lawful
and right; and hath not eaten upon the mountains; nor
hath lift up his eyes to the idols of the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> nei|ther
hath defiled his neighbour's wife; <HI>neither hath come near
to a men&s;truous woman;</HI> and hath not oppre&s;&s;ed any, but
hath re&s;tored to the debtor his pledge; hath &s;poiled
none by violence; hath given his bread to the hungry,
and hath covered the naked with a garment; <HI>he that
<PB N="379" REF="417">
hath not given upon u&s;ury, neither hath taken any increa&s;e;</HI>
that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity; hath exe|cuted
true judgment between man and man; hath
walked in my &s;tatutes, and hath kept my judgments to
deal truly; he is ju&s;t, he &s;hall &s;urely live, &s;aith the
Lord God.&endq; <HI>Ezek.</HI> xviii. 5&mdash;9. The &s;ame thing may
be ob&s;erved of the apo&s;tolic decree recorded in the fifteenth
chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI>&mdash;&startq;It &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than the&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary things; that ye ab&s;tain from meats offered to
idols, and from blood, and from things &s;trangled, and
<HI>from fornication:</HI> from which if ye keep your&s;elves,
ye &s;hall do well.&endq;</P>
<P>II. If the law by which the &s;abbath was in&s;tituted, was
a law only to the <HI>Jews,</HI> it becomes an important que&s;tion
with the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> enquirer, whether the founder of his re|ligion
delivered any new command upon the &s;ubject; or,
if that &s;hould not appear to be the ca&s;e, whether any day
was appropriated to the &s;ervice of religion, by the authority
or example of his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>The practice of holding religious a&s;&s;emblies upon the
fir&s;t day of the week, was &s;o early and univer&s;al in the
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church that it carries with it con&s;iderable proof of
having originated from &s;ome precept of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> or his apo&s;|tles,
though none &s;uch be now extant. It was upon the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> day of the week that the di&s;ciples were a&s;&s;embled when
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> fir&s;t appeared to them after his re&s;urrection; &startq;then
<PB N="380" REF="418">
the &s;ame day at evening, <HI>being the fir&s;t day of the week,</HI>
when the doors were &s;hut, where the di&s;ciples were a&s;|&s;embled,
for fear of the <HI>Jews,</HI> came <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and &s;tood in
the mid&s;t of them.&endq; <HI>John</HI> xx. 19. This, for any thing
that appears in the account, might as to the day have been
accidental: but in the 26th ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter we
read that &startq;after eight days,&endq; that is on the <HI>fir&s;t day</HI> of the
week <HI>following, &startq;again</HI> the di&s;ciples were within,&endq; which
&s;econd meeting upon the &s;ame day of the week looks like
an appointment and de&s;ign to meet on that particular day.
In the twentieth chapter of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles we
find the &s;ame cu&s;tom in a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church at a great di&s;|tance
from <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI>&mdash;&startq;And we came unto them to
<HI>Troas</HI> in five days, where we abode &s;even days; and
<HI>upon the fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came together
to break bread, Paul</HI> preached unto them.&endq; <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 6,
7. The manner in which the hi&s;torian mentions &startq;the
di&s;ciples coming together to break bread on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day
of the week,&endq; &s;hews, I think, that the practice by this
time was familiar and e&s;tabli&s;hed. St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corin|thians</HI>
writes thus: &startq;Concerning the collection for the
&s;aints, as I have given order to the churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI>
even &s;o do ye; <HI>upon the fir&s;t day of the week</HI> let every one
of you lay by him in &s;tore as God hath pro&s;pered him, that
there be no gatherings when I come.&endq; 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 1, 2.
Which direction affords a probable proof, that the fir&s;t day
of the week, was already, among&s;t the Chri&s;tians both of
<HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, by &s;ome
religious application or other. At the time that St. <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="381" REF="419">
wrote the book of his revelation, the fir&s;t day of the week
had obtained the name of the <HI>Lord's day;</HI> I was in the
&s;pirit, &s;ays he, <HI>on the Lord's day.</HI> Rev. i. 10. Which name,
and St. <HI>John</HI>'s u&s;e of it, &s;ufficiently denote the appropria|tion
of this day to the &s;ervice of religion, and that this ap|propriation
was perfectly known to the churches of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI>
I make no doubt but that by the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>day</HI> was meant
the <HI>fir&s;t day</HI> of the week; for we find no foot&s;teps of any
di&s;tinction of days, which could entitle any other to that
appellation. The &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory of Chri&s;tianity, cor|re&s;ponds
with the accounts delivered on this &s;ubject, in
&s;cripture.</P>
<P>It will be remembered, that we are contending by the&s;e
proofs, for no other duty upon the fir&s;t day of the week,
than that of holding and frequenting religious a&s;&s;emblies.
A ce&s;&s;ation upon that day from labour, beyond the time
of attendance upon public wor&s;hip, is not intimated in any
pa&s;&s;age of the New Te&s;tament. Nor did <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> or his
Apo&s;tles deliver, that we know of, any command to their
di&s;ciples for a di&s;continuance upon that day of the com|mon
offices of their profe&s;&s;ions. A re&s;erve which none
will &s;ee rea&s;on to wonder at, or reproach as a defect in the
in&s;titution, who con&s;ider that in the primitive condition of
Chri&s;tianity, the ob&s;ervation of a new &s;abhath would have
been u&s;le&s;s, or inconvenient, or impracticable. During
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s per&s;onal mini&s;try his religion was preached to the
<HI>Jews</HI> alone. <HI>They</HI> already had a &s;abbath, which, as citi|zens
and &s;ubjects of that oeconomy, they were obliged to
<PB N="382" REF="420">
keep, and did keep. It was not therefore probable that
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would enjoin another day of re&s;t in conjunction with
this. When the new religion came forth into the world,
and among the Gentiles, few of the converts to it had
their time and labour at their own di&s;po&s;al; and it was
&s;carcely to be expected, that unbelieving ma&s;ters and ma|gi&s;trates,
and they who directed the employment of
others, would permit their &s;laves and labourers to re&s;t
from their work every &s;eventh day; or that civil govern|ment,
indeed, would have &s;ubmitted to the lo&s;s of a &s;e|venth
part of the public indu&s;try, and that too in addition
to the numerous fe&s;tivals which the national religions in|dulged
to the people: at lea&s;t this would have been an
incumbrance, which might have greatly retarded the re|ception
of Chri&s;tianity in the world. In reality, the in&s;ti|&s;tution
of a weekly &s;abbath is &s;o connected with the
functions of civil life, and requires &s;o much of the con|currence
of civil laws in its regulation and &s;upport, that
it cannot, perhaps, properly be made the ordinance of any
religion, till that religion be received as the religion of the
&s;tate.</P>
<P>The opinion that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles meant to re|tain
the duties of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;abbath, &s;hifting only the day
from the &s;eventh to the fir&s;t, &s;eems to prevail without &s;uf|ficient
proof; nor does any evidence remain in &s;cripture,
(of what, however, is not improbable) that the fir&s;t day
of the week was thus di&s;tingui&s;hed in commemoration of
our Lord's re&s;urrection.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="421">
The conclu&s;ion from the whole enquiry, for it is our
bu&s;ine&s;s to follow the arguments to whatever probability
they conduct us, is this: the <HI>a&s;&s;embling</HI> upon the fir&s;t day of
the week for the purpo&s;e of public wor&s;hip and religious
in&s;truction is a law of Chri&s;tianity, of divine appointment;
the <HI>re&s;ting</HI> on that day from our employments, longer than
we are detained from them by attendance upon the&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies,
is to Chri&s;tians, an ordinance of human in&s;titution;
binding neverthele&s;s upon the con&s;cience of every indivi|dual
of a country in which a weekly &s;abbath is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
for the &s;ake of the beneficial purpo&s;es which the public
and regular ob&s;ervation of it promotes; and recommended
perhaps in &s;ome degree to the divine approbation, by the
re&s;emblance it bears to what God was plea&s;ed to make a
&s;olemn part of the law which he delivered to the people of
<HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and by its &s;ub&s;erviency to many of the &s;ame u&s;es.</P>

<P>With the primitive Chri&s;tians the peculiar, and proba|bly
for &s;ome time the only di&s;tinction of the fir&s;t day of
the week, was the holding of religious a&s;&s;emblies upon that
<PB N="385" REF="423">
day. We learn, however, from the te&s;timony of a very

(though differing from our ordinary occupation) hinder
our attendance upon public wor&s;hip, or take up &s;o much
of our time, as not to leave a &s;ufficient part of the day at

which bear no relation to the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion.</P>
<P>2dly. By unnece&s;&s;ary encroachments upon the re&s;t and

the religious ob&s;ervation of Sunday, if it ought to be re|tained
at all, mu&s;t be upheld by &s;ome public and vi&s;ible
di&s;tinctions&mdash;that draw the line of di&s;tinction where you
will, many actions which are &s;ituated on the confines of
the line, will differ very little, yet lie on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of
it&mdash;that every tre&s;pa&s;s upon that re&s;erve, which public de|cency
has e&s;tabli&s;hed, breaks down the fence, by which
the day is &s;eparated to the &s;ervice of religion&mdash;that it is
un&s;afe to trifle with &s;cruples and habits that have a bene|ficial
tendency, though founded in mere cu&s;tom&mdash;that
the&s;e liberties, however intended, will certainly be con&s;i|dered
by tho&s;e who ob&s;erve them, not only as di&s;re|&s;pectful
to the day and in&s;titution, but as proceed|ing
from a &s;ecret contempt of the Chri&s;tian faith&mdash;that

efficacy of our example reaches; or rather, &s;o far as
either will &s;erve for an excu&s;e of negligence to tho&s;e who

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Reverencing the Deity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is in many a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;e of awe,
which over&s;preads the imagination, whenever the
idea of the Supreme Being is pre&s;ented to their thoughts.
This, which forms a con&s;iderable &s;ecurity again&s;t vice, is
the effect, not &s;o much of reflection, as of habit; which
habit being generated by the external expre&s;&s;ions of reve|rence,
which we u&s;e our&s;elves, and ob&s;erve in tho&s;e about
us, may be de&s;troyed by cau&s;es oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, and es|pecially,
by that familiar levity with which &s;ome learn to
&s;peak of the Deity, of his attributes, providence, revela|tions,
or wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>God hath been plea&s;ed, no matter for what rea&s;on, al|though
probably for this, to forbid the vain mention of his
name&mdash;&startq;Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain.&endq; Now the mention is vain, when it is
u&s;ele&s;s; and it is u&s;ele&s;s, when it is neither likely nor in|tended
to &s;erve any good purpo&s;e; as when it flows from
the lips idle or unmeaning, or is applied upon occa&s;ions
incon&s;i&s;tent with any con&s;ideration of religion or devotion,
to expre&s;s our anger, our earne&s;tne&s;s, our courage, or
our mirth; or indeed, when it is u&s;ed at all, except in acts
<PB N="389" REF="427">
of religion, or in &s;erious and &s;ea&s;onable di&s;cour&s;e upon re|ligious
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The prohibition of the third commandment is recogni|zed
by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in his &s;ermon upon the mount, which &s;er|mon
adverts to none but the moral parts of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law.
&startq;I &s;ay unto you &s;wear not at all; but let your commu|nication
be yea yea, nay nay; for what&s;oever is more
than the&s;e, cometh of evil.&endq; The <HI>Jews</HI> probably inter|preted
the prohibition as re&s;trained to the name <HI>Jehovah,</HI>
the name which the Deity had appointed and appropriated
to him&s;elf. <HI>Ex.</HI> vi. 3. The words of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> extend the prohibition
beyond the <HI>name</HI> of God to every thing a&s;&s;ociated with the
idea. &startq;Swear not, neither by heaven, for it is God's
throne; nor by the earth, for it is his foot-&s;tool; neither
by Jeru&s;alem, for it is the city of the great King.&endq; <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 35.</P>
<P>The offence of profane &s;wearing, is aggravated by
the con&s;ideration, that duty and decency are &s;acrificed
thereby to the &s;lendere&s;t of temptations. Suppo&s;e the habit
either from affectation, or by negligence and inadvertency
to be already formed; it co&s;ts, one would think, little to
relinqui&s;h the plea&s;ure and honour which it confers, and
it mu&s;t always be within the power of the mo&s;t ordinary
re&s;olution to correct it. Zeal, and a concern for duty, are
in fact never &s;trong, when the exertion requi&s;ite to van|qui&s;h
a habit founded in no antecedent propen&s;ity, is
thought too much, or too painful.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="428">
A contempt of po&s;itive duties, or rather of tho&s;e duties
for which the rea&s;on is not &s;o plain as the command, indicates
a di&s;po&s;ition upon which the authority of revelation has
obtained little influence.&mdash;This remark is applicable to the
offence of profane &s;wearing, and de&s;cribes, perhaps, the
general character of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t addicted to it.</P>
<P>Mockery and ridicule, when exerci&s;ed upon the &s;crip|tures,
or even upon the places, per&s;ons, and forms &s;et
apart for the mini&s;tration of religion, fall within the mi&s;|chief
of the law, which forbids the profanation of God's
name, e&s;pecially as it is extended by Chri&s;t's interpretation.
They are moreover incon&s;i&s;tent with a religious frame of
mind; for no one ever feels him&s;elf either di&s;po&s;ed to
plea&s;antry, or capable of being diverted with the plea&s;an|try
of others, upon matters in which he is cordially inter|e&s;ted.
A mind intent upon the attainment of heaven,
rejects with indignation, every attempt to entertain it,
with je&s;ts, calculated to degrade or deride &s;ubjects, which
it never recollects, but with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and anxiety&mdash;No|thing
but &s;tupidity, or the mo&s;t frivolous di&s;&s;ipation of
thought, can make even the incon&s;iderate forget the &s;u|preme
importance of every thing which relates to the
expectation of a future exi&s;tence. Whil&s;t the infidel mocks
at the &s;uper&s;titions of the vulgar, in&s;ults over their credu|lous
fears, their childish errors, and fanta&s;tic rites, it does
not occur to him to ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous
device by which the weake&s;t devotee ever believed he was
<PB N="391" REF="429">
&s;ecuring the happine&s;s of a future life, is more rational, than
unconcern about it. Upon this &s;ubject nothing is &s;o ab&s;urd,
as indifference&mdash;no folly &s;o contemptible, as thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
and levity.</P>
<P>Finally, the knowledge of what is due to the &s;olemnity
of tho&s;e intere&s;ts, concerning which revelation profe&s;&s;es
to inform and direct us, may teach even those who are
lea&s;t inclined to re&s;pect the prejudices of mankind, to ob|&s;erve
a decorum in the &s;tyle and conduct of religious di&s;|qui&s;itions,
with the neglect of which, many adver&s;aries of
Chri&s;tianity, are ju&s;tly chargeable. Serious arguments are
fair on all &s;ides. Chri&s;tianity is but ill defended by refu&s;|ing
audience or toleration to the objections of unbelievers.
But whil&s;t we would have freedom of enquiry, re&s;trained
by no laws, but tho&s;e of decency, we are entitled to de|mand
on behalf of a religion, which holds forth to man|kind
a&s;&s;urances of immortality, that its credit be a&s;&s;ailed
by no other weapons than tho&s;e of &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and
legitimate rea&s;oning&mdash;that the truth or fal&s;hood of Chri&s;|tianity
be never made a topic of raillery, a theme for the
exerci&s;e of wit or eloquence, or a &s;ubject of contention for
literary fame and victory&mdash;that the cau&s;e be tried upon its
merits&mdash;that all applications to the fancy, pa&s;&s;ions, or
prejudices of the reader, all attempts to pre-occupy, en|&s;nare,
or perplex his judgment, by any art, influence, or
impre&s;&s;ion what&s;oever, extrin&s;ic to the proper grounds and
evidence upon which his a&s;&s;ent ought to proceed, be re|jected
from a que&s;tion, which involves in its determination,
<PB N="392" REF="430">
the hopes, the virtue, and repo&s;e of millions&mdash;that the
controver&s;y be managed on both &s;ides with &s;incerity, that
is, that nothing be produced in the writings of either,
contrary to, or beyond, the writer's own knowledge and
per&s;ua&s;ion&mdash;that objections and difficulties be propo&s;ed
from no other motive, than an hone&s;t and &s;erious de&s;ire to
obtain &s;atisfaction, or to communicate information which
may promote the di&s;covery and progre&s;s of truth&mdash;that
in conformity with this de&s;ign, every thing be &s;tated
with integrity, with method, preci&s;ion and &s;implicity;
and above all, that whatever is publi&s;hed in oppo|&s;ition
to received and confe&s;&s;edly beneficial per&s;ua&s;ions,
be &s;et forth under a form, which is likely to invite en|quiry,
and to meet examination. If with the&s;e moderate
and equitable conditions, be compared, the manner in which
ho&s;tilities have been waged again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion,
not only the votaries of the prevailing faith, but every
man who looks forward with anxiety to the destination of
his being, will &s;ee much to blame, and to complain of.
By <HI>one unbeliever,</HI> all the follies which have adhered, in a
long cour&s;e of dark and super&s;titious ages, to the popular

Apo&s;tles, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubverting the whole &s;y&s;tem,
by the ab&s;urdities, which it is <HI>thus</HI> repre&s;ented to contain.
By <HI>another,</HI> the ignorance and vices of the &s;acerdotal order,
their mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions and per&s;ecutions, their u&s;urpations
and incroachments upon the intellectual liberty and civil
rights of mankind, have been di&s;played with no &s;mall
triumph and invective, not &s;o much to guard the Chri&s;tian

laity again&s;t a repetition of the &s;ame injuries, which is the
only proper u&s;e to be made of the mo&s;t flagrant examples
pa&s;t, as to prepare the way for an in&s;inuation, that the re|ligion
it&s;elf, is nothing el&s;e than a profitable fable, impo&s;ed
upon the fears and credulity of the multitude, and upheld
by the frauds, and influence, of an intere&s;ted and crafty
prie&s;thood. And yet how remotely is the character of the
clergy connected with the truth of Chri&s;tianity! or what
more do the mo&s;t di&s;graceful pages of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory
prove, than that the pa&s;&s;ions of our common nature are not
altered or excluded by di&s;tinctions of name, and that the
characters of men are formed much more by the tempta|tions,
than the duties of their profe&s;&s;ion? A <HI>third</HI>
finds delight, in collecting and repeating accounts of
wars and ma&s;&s;acres, of tumults and in&s;urrections, excited
in almo&s;t every age of the Christian aera, by religious zeal;

intolerance and extirpation precepts of the go&s;pel; or

I &s;ay, of this &s;ort, are exhibited to the public at|tention,
as &s;o many arguments again&s;t the <HI>truth</HI> of the
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion&mdash;and with &s;ucce&s;s. For the&s;e topics,
being brought together and &s;et off with &s;ome aggravation
of circum&s;tances, and a vivacity of &s;tyle and de&s;cription,
familiar enough to the writings and conver&s;ation of free-thinkers,
in&s;en&s;ibly lead the imagination into a habit of
cla&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity with the delu&s;ions, that have taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by turns, of the public belief; and of regarding
it, as what the &s;coffers of our faith repre&s;ent it to be, <HI>the
&s;uper&s;tition of a day.</HI> But is this to deal hone&s;tly by the
&s;ubject, or with the world? May not the &s;ame things be
&s;aid, may not the &s;ame prejudices be excited by the&s;e re|pre&s;entations,
whether Chri&s;tianity be true or fal&s;e, or by
whatever proofs its truth be atte&s;ted? May not truth as
<PB N="395" REF="433">
well as fal&s;hood be taken upon credit? May not a religion
be founded upon evidence, acce&s;&s;ible, and fatisfactory to
every mind competent to the enquiry, which yet, by the
greate&s;t part of its profe&s;&s;ors, is received upon authority?</P>
<P>But if the <HI>matter</HI> of the&s;e objections be reprehen&s;ible, as
calculated to produce an effect upon the reader, beyond
what their real weight, and place in the argument de&s;erve,
&s;till more &s;hall we di&s;cover of management and di&s;ingenu|ou&s;ne&s;s
in the <HI>form</HI> under which they are di&s;per&s;ed among
the public. Infidelity, is &s;erved up in every &s;hape, that is
likely to allure, &s;urprize, or beguile the imagination&mdash;in a
fable, a tale, a novel, a poem&mdash;in inter&s;per&s;ed and broken
hints&mdash;remote and oblique &s;urmi&s;es&mdash;in books of travels,
of philo&s;ophy, of natural hi&s;tory&mdash;in a word, in any form,
rather than the right one, that of a profe&s;&s;ed and regular
di&s;qui&s;ition. And becau&s;e the coar&s;e buffoonery, and
broad laugh of the old and rude adver&s;aries of the Chri&s;|tian
faith, would offend, the ta&s;te, perhaps, rather than
the virtue of this cultivated age, a graver irony, a more
&s;kilful and delicate banter, is &s;ub&s;tituted in their place.
An eloquent hi&s;torian, be&s;ides his more direct, and there|fore
fairer attacks, upon the credibility of the evangelic
&s;tory, has contrived to weave into his narration, one con|tinued
&s;neer upon the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, and the writings
and characters of its ancient patrons. The knowledge which
this author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of the frame and conduct of the human
mind, mu&s;t have led him to observe, that &s;uch attacks do
their execution, without enquiry. Who can refute a
<PB N="396" REF="434">
<HI>&s;neer?</HI> Who can compute the number, much le&s;s, one by
one, &s;crutinize the ju&s;tice, of tho&s;e di&s;paraging in&s;inua|tions,
which croud the pages of this elaborate hi&s;tory?
What reader &s;u&s;pends his curio&s;ity, or calls off his atten|tion
from the principal narrative, to examine references,
to &s;earch into the foundation, or to weigh the rea&s;on, pro|priety
and force, of every tran&s;ient &s;arca&s;m, and &s;ly allu|&s;ion,
by which the Chri&s;tian te&s;timony is depreciated and
traduced? and by which neverthele&s;s, he may find his
faith afterwards un&s;ettled and perplexed.</P>
<P>But the enemies of Chri&s;tianity have pur&s;ued her with
poi&s;oned arrows. Ob&s;cenity itself is made the vehicle of
infidelity. The awful doctrines, if we be not permitted
to call them the &s;acred truths, of our religion, together
with all the adjuncts and appendages of its wor&s;hip, and
external profe&s;&s;ion, are impudently profaned by an unna|tural
conjunction with impure and la&s;civious images. The
fondne&s;s for ridicule is almo&s;t univer&s;al; and ridicule to
many minds is never &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, as when heightened by
ob&s;cenity, and employed upon religion. But in propor|tion
as the&s;e noxious principles take hold of the imagina|tion,
they infatuate the judgment; for trains of ludicrous
and uncha&s;te a&s;&s;ociations adhering to every &s;entiment and
mention of religion, render the mind indi&s;po&s;ed to receive
either conviction from its evidence, or impre&s;&s;ions from
its authority. And this effect being exerted upon the &s;en|&s;itive
part of our frame, is altogether independent of ar|gument,
proof, or rea&s;on; and as formidable to a true
<PB N="397" REF="435">
religion, as to a fal&s;e one; to a well-grounded faith, as to a
chimerical mythology, or fabulous tradition. Neither, let
it be ob&s;erved, is the crime or danger le&s;s, becau&s;e impure
ideas are exhibited under a veil, in covert and cha&s;tized
language.</P>
<P>Seriou&s;ne&s;s, is not con&s;traint of thought; nor levity,
freedom. Every mind which wi&s;hes the advancement of
truth and knowledge, in the mo&s;t important of all human
re&s;earches, mu&s;t abhor this licentiou&s;ne&s;s as violating no
le&s;s the laws of rea&s;oning, than the rights of decen|cy.
There is but one de&s;cription of men, to who&s;e
principles it ought to be tolerable, I mean that cla&s;s of
rea&s;oners, who can &s;ee <HI>little</HI> in Chri&s;tianity, even &s;uppo&s;ing
it to be true. To &s;uch adver&s;aries we addre&s;s this reflec|tion&mdash;Had
<HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> delivered no other declaration, than
the following: &startq;The hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall
come forth; they that have done good, unto the re&s;ur|rection
of life, and they that have done evil unto the
re&s;urrection of damnation;&endq; he had pronounced a
me&s;&s;age of ine&s;timable importance, and well worthy of
that &s;plendid apparatus of prophecy and miracles, with
which his mi&s;&s;ion was introduced, and atte&s;ted&mdash;a me&s;&s;age,
in which the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind would rejoice to find an
an&s;wer to their doubts, and re&s;t to their enquiries. It is
idle to &s;ay, that a future &s;tate had been di&s;covered already&mdash;It
had been di&s;covered, as the <HI>Copernican</HI> &s;y&s;tem was&mdash;it was
<PB N="398" REF="436">
one gue&s;s among&s;t many. He alone di&s;covers, who <HI>proves;</HI>
and no man can prove this point, but the teacher who

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origin of Civil Government.</HEAD>
<P>GOVERNMENT, at fir&s;t, was either patriarchal or
military; <HI>that</HI> of a parent over his family, or of a
commander over his fellow warriors.</P>
<P>I. Paternal authority, and the order of dome&s;tic life,
&s;upplied the foundation of <HI>civil government.</HI> Did mankind
&s;pring out of the earth mature and independent, it would
be found perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, to introduce &s;ubjection and
&s;ubordination among them; but the condition of human
<PB N="400" REF="438">
infancy prepares men for &s;ociety, by combining individuals
into &s;mall communities, and placing them from the
be|ginning
under direction and controll. A family contains
the rudiments of an empire. The authority of one over
many, and the di&s;po&s;ition to govern and be governed, are
in this way incidental to the very nature, and coeval, no doubt,
with the exi&s;tence of the human &s;pecies. Moreover,
the constitution of families, not only a&s;&s;i&s;ts the formation
of civil government, by the di&s;po&s;itions which it gene|rates,
but al&s;o furni&s;hes the fir&s;t &s;teps of the proce&s;s by
which empires have been actually reared. A parent would
retain a con&s;iderable part of his authority after his chil|dren
were grown up, and had formed families of their
own. The obedience, of which they remembered not the
beginning, would be considered as natural; and would
&s;carcely, during the parent's life, be entirely or abruptly
withdrawn. This is the &s;econd &s;tage in the progre&s;s of
dominion. The fir&s;t, was that of a parent over his young
children: we now &s;ee an ance&s;tor pre&s;iding over his adult
de&s;cendants. And altho' the original progenitor was the
centre of union to his po&s;terity, yet it is not probable that
the a&s;&s;ociation would be immediately or altogether di&s;|&s;olved
by his death. Connected by habits of intercour&s;e
and affection, and by &s;ome common rights, nece&s;&s;ities,
and intere&s;ts, they would con&s;ider them&s;elves as allied to
each other in a nearer degree than to the re&s;t of the &s;pe|cies.
Almost all would be &s;en&s;ible of an inclination to
continue in the &s;ociety in which they had been brought
up; and experiencing as they &s;oon would, many incon|veniences
<PB N="401" REF="439">
from the ab&s;ence of that authority which their
common ance&s;tor exerci&s;ed, e&s;pecially in deciding their
di&s;putes, and directing their operations in matters in which
it was nece&s;&s;ary to act in conjunction, they might be
in|duced
to &s;upply his place by a formal choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
or rather might willingly and almo&s;t imperceptibly tran&s;|fer
their obedience to &s;ome one of the family who by his
age or &s;ervices, or by the part he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the direction
of their affairs during the life-time of the parent, had al|ready
taught them to re&s;pect his advice, or to attend to
his commands; or la&s;tly, the pro&s;pect of the&s;e inconve|niences
might prompt the fir&s;t ance&s;tor to appoint a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
and his po&s;terity, from the &s;ame motive united with
an habitual deference to his authority, would receive the
appointment with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Here then we have a tribe
or clan incorporated under one chief. Such communities
might be increa&s;ed by con&s;iderable numbers, and fulfill the
purpo&s;es of civil union without any other or more regular
convention, con&s;titution, or form of government, than
what we have de&s;cribed. Every branch which was &s;lip|ped
off from the primitive &s;tock, and removed to a di&s;tance
from it, would in like manner take root, and grow into a
&s;eparate clan. Two or three of the&s;e clans were frequent|ly
we may &s;uppo&s;e united into one. Marriage, conque&s;t,
mutual defence, common di&s;tre&s;s, or more accidental coa|litions,
might produce this effect.</P>
<P>II. A &s;econd &s;ource of per&s;onal authority, and which
might ea&s;ily extend or &s;ometimes perhaps &s;uper&s;ede the
<PB N="402" REF="440">
patriarchal, is that, which re&s;ults from military arrange|ment.
In wars, either of aggre&s;&s;ion, or defence, manife&s;t
nece&s;&s;ity would prompt tho&s;e who fought on the &s;ame &s;ide,
to array them&s;elves under one leader. And although their
<HI>leader</HI> was advanced to to this eminence for the purpo&s;e only and during the operations of a &s;ingle expedition, yet
his authority would not always terminate with the rea&s;ons
for which it was conferred. A warrior who had led forth his
tribe again&s;t their enemies with repeated &s;ucce&s;s, would
procure to him&s;elf even in the deliberations of peace, a
powerful and permanent influence. If this advantage
were added to the authority of the patriarchal chief, or
favoured by any previous di&s;tinction of ance&s;try, it would
be no difficult undertaking for the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it,
to obtain the almo&s;t ab&s;olute direction of the affairs of
the community, e&s;pecially if he was careful to a&s;&s;ociate to
him&s;elf proper auxiliaries, and content to practice the ob|vious
art of gratifying or removing tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed his
preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>But although we may be able to comprehend how by his
per&s;onal abilities or fortune one man may obtain the rule
over many, yet it &s;eems more difficult to explain how em|pire
became hereditary, or in what manner &s;overeign
power, which is never acquired without great merit or ma|nagement,
learns to de&s;cend in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which has no
dependence upon any qualities, either of under&s;tanding, or
activity. The cau&s;es which have introduced hereditary
dominion into &s;o general a reception in the world, are
<PB N="403" REF="441">
principally the following&mdash;the influence of a&s;&s;ociation,
which communicates to the &s;on a portion of the &s;ame re&s;pect
which was wont to be paid to the virtues, or &s;tation of the
father&mdash;the mutual jealou&s;y of other competitors&mdash;the
greater envy, with which all behold the exaltation of an
equal, than the continuance of an acknowledged &s;uperiori|ty&mdash;the
founder of the family would leave behind him
many adherents, who could only pre&s;erve their own im|portance,
by &s;upporting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his children&mdash;Add
to the&s;e rea&s;ons, that elections to the &s;upreme power
having upon &s;ome occa&s;ions produced the mo&s;t de&s;tructive
contentions, many &s;tates would take refuge from a return
of the &s;ame calamities, in a rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and no rule
pre&s;ents it&s;elf &s;o obvious, certain, and intelligible, as con|&s;anguinity of birth.</P>
<P>The antient &s;tate of &s;ociety in mo&s;t. countries, and the
modern condition of &s;ome uncivilized parts of the world,
exhibit that appearance, which this account of the original
of civil government would lead us to expect. The earlie&s;t
hi&s;tories of <HI>Pale&s;tine, Greece, Italy, Gaul, Britain,</HI> inform
us, that the&s;e countries were occupied by many &s;mall in|dependent
nations, not much perhaps unlike tho&s;e which
are found at pre&s;ent among&s;t the &s;avage inhabitants of
<HI>North America,</HI> and upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> The&s;e na|tions,
I con&s;ider, as the amplifications of &s;o many &s;ingle
&s;amilies, on derived from the junction of two or three fa|milies,
whom &s;ociety in war or the approach of common
danger had united. Suppo&s;e a country to have been fir&s;t
<PB N="404" REF="442">
peopled by &s;hipwreck on its coa&s;ts, or by emigrants, or
exiles from &s;ome neighbouring country, the new &s;ettlers
having no enemy to provide again&s;t, and occupied with
the care of their per&s;onal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, would think little
of dige&s;ting laws, of contriving a form of government, or
indeed of any political union at all; but each &s;ettler would
remain at the head of his own family, and each family
would include all of every age and generation who were
de&s;cended from him. So many of the&s;e families as were
holden together after the death of the original ance&s;tor, by
the rea&s;ons, and in the method above recited, would wax
as the individuals were multiplied, into tribes, clans,
hords, or nations, &s;imilar to tho&s;e into which the antient
inhabitants of many countries are known to have been di|vided,
and which are &s;till found, wherever the &s;tate of
&s;ociety and manners is immature and uncultivated.</P>
<P>Nor need we be &s;urprized at the early exi&s;tence in the
world of &s;ome va&s;t empires, or the rapidity with which
they advanced to their greatne&s;s, from comparatively &s;mall
and ob&s;cure originals, Whil&s;t the inhabitants of &s;o many
countries were broken into numerous communities, un|connected,
and oftentimes contending with each other; be|fore
experience had taught the&s;e little &s;tates to &s;ee their own
danger in their neighbour's ruin; or had in&s;tructed them
in the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;ting the aggrandizement of an a&s;|piring
power, by alliances and timely preparations; in this
condition of civil policy, a particular tribe who by any
means had got the &s;tart of the re&s;t in &s;trength, or di&s;ci|pline,
<PB N="405" REF="443">
and happened to fall under the conduct of an am|bitious
chief, by directing their fir&s;t attempts to where
&s;ucce&s;s was mo&s;t &s;ecure, and by a&s;&s;uming, as they went
along, tho&s;e whom they conquered into a &s;hare of their
future enterprizes, might &s;oon gather a force, which
would infallibly overbear any oppo&s;ition, that the divided
power and unprovided &s;tate of &s;uch enemies could make
to the progre&s;s of their victories.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, our theory affords a pre&s;umption, that the fir&s;t
governments were monarchies, becau&s;e the government of
families, and of armies, from which, according to our ac|count
civil government derived its in&s;titution, and probably
its form, is univer&s;ally monarchical.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Subjection to Civil-Government is maintained</HEAD>
<P>COULD we view our own &s;pecies from a di&s;tance, and
regard mankind with the &s;ame &s;ort of ob&s;ervation,
with which we read the natural hi&s;tory or remark the
<HI>manners</HI> of any other animal, there is nothing in the hu|man
character which would more &s;urprize us, than the
almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;ubjugation of &s;trength to weakne&s;s&mdash;than
to &s;ee many millions perhaps of robu&s;t men in the com|plete
u&s;e and exerci&s;e of their per&s;onal faculties and with|out
any defect of courage, waiting upon the will of a
child, a woman, a driveller, or a lunatic. And although
when we &s;uppo&s;e a va&s;t empire in ab&s;olute &s;ubjection to
one per&s;on and that one depre&s;&s;ed beneath the level of his
&s;pecies by infirmities, or vice, we &s;uppo&s;e perhaps an ex|treme
ca&s;e, yet in all ca&s;es, even in the mo&s;t popular
forms of civil government, <HI>the phy&s;ical &s;trength re&s;ides in the
governed.</HI> In what manner opinion thus prevails over
&s;trength, or how power, which naturally belongs to &s;u|perior
force, is maintained in oppo&s;ition to it, in other
words, by what motives the many are induced to &s;ubmit
to the few, becomes an enquiry which lies at the root of
<PB N="407" REF="445">
almo&s;t every political &s;peculation. It removes, indeed,
but does not re&s;olve the difficulty to &s;ay, that civil govern|ments
are now-a-days almo&s;t univer&s;ally upheld by &s;tand|ing
armies, for the que&s;tion &s;till returns, how are the&s;e
armies them&s;elves kept in &s;ubjection and made to obey the
directions, and carry on the de&s;igns, of the prince, or
&s;tate which employs them.</P>
<P>Now although we &s;hould look in vain for any <HI>&s;ingle</HI>
rea&s;on which will account for the general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of
mankind to civil government, yet it may not be difficult
to a&s;&s;ign for every cla&s;s and character in the community,
con&s;iderations powerful enough to di&s;&s;uade each from any
attempts to re&s;i&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed authority. Every man has
his motive, though not the &s;ame. In this as in other in|&s;tances,
the conduct is &s;imilar, but the principles which
produce it, extremely various.</P>
<P>There are three principal di&s;tinctions of character, into
which the &s;ubjects of a &s;tate may be divided; into tho&s;e
who obey from prejudice; tho&s;e who obey from rea&s;on;
and tho&s;e who obey from &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I. They who obey from prejudice, are determined by
an opinion of <HI>right,</HI> in their governors; which opinion is
founded upon <HI>pre&s;cription.</HI> In monarchies and ari&s;tocracies
which are hereditary, the pre&s;cription operates in favour of
particular families; in republics and elective offices, in fa|vour
of particular forms of government or <HI>con&s;titutions.</HI> Nor
<PB N="408" REF="446">
is it to be wondered at, that mankind &s;hould reverence
authority founded in pre&s;cription, when they ob&s;erve that
pre&s;cription confers a title to almo&s;t every thing el&s;e. The
whole cour&s;e, and all the habits off civil life, favor this
prejudice. Upon what other foundation &s;tands any man's
right to his e&s;tate? The right of primogeniture, the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of kindred, the de&s;cent of property, the inheritance
of honours, the demand of tythes, tolls, rents, or &s;er|vices
from the e&s;tates of others, the right of way, the
powers of office and magi&s;tracy, the privileges of nobility,
the immunities of the clergy, upon what are they all
founded, in the apprehen&s;ion at lea&s;t of the multitude,
but upon pre&s;cription? To what el&s;e, when the claims
are conte&s;ted, is the appeal made? It is natural to transfer
the &s;ame principle to the affairs of government, and to re|gard
tho&s;e exertions of power, which have been long exer|ci&s;ed
and acquie&s;ced in, as &s;o many <HI>rights</HI> in the &s;overeign,
and to con&s;ider obedience to his commands, within certain
accu&s;tomed limits, as enjoined by that rule of con&s;cience,
which requires us to render to every man his due.</P>
<P>In hereditary monarchies, the <HI>pre&s;criptive title</HI> is corroborat|ed,
and its influence con&s;iderably augmented, by an acce&s;|&s;ion
of religious &s;entiments, and by that &s;acredne&s;s which
men are wont to a&s;cribe to the per&s;ons of princes. Princes
them&s;elves have not failed to take advantage of this di&s;po|&s;ition,
by claiming a &s;uperior dignity, as it were, of na|ture,
or a peculiar delegation from the Supreme Being.
For this purpo&s;e were introduced the titles of <HI>&s;acred</HI> maje&s;ty,
<PB N="409" REF="447">
of God's anointed, repre&s;entative, vicegerent, together
with the ceremonies of inve&s;titures and coronations, which
are calculated not &s;o much to recognize the authority of
&s;overeigns, as to con&s;ecrate their per&s;ons. Where a fabu|lous
religion permitted it, the public veneration has been
challenged by bolder pretensions. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors
u&s;urped the titles, and arrogated the wor&s;hip of gods. The
mythology of the heroic ages, and of many barbarous na|tions,
was ea&s;ily converted to this purpo&s;e. Some princes,
like the heroes of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the founder of the Roman
name, derived their birth from the Gods: others, with
<HI>Numa,</HI> pretended a &s;ecret but &s;upernatural communication
with &s;ome divine being: and others again, like the <HI>Incas</HI>
of <HI>Peru,</HI> and the antient <HI>Saxon</HI> kings, extracted their de&s;cent
from the deities of their country. The <HI>Lama</HI> of <HI>Thibet,</HI>
at this day, is held forth to his &s;ubjects, not as the offspring
or &s;ucce&s;&s;or of a divine race of princes, but as the im|mortal
God him&s;elf, the object at once of civil obedience,
and religious adoration. This in&s;tance is &s;ingular, and
may be accounted the farthe&s;t point to which the abu&s;e of
human credulity has ever been carried. But in all the&s;e
in&s;tances the purpo&s;e was the &s;ame; to engage the reve|rence
of mankind, by an application to their religious
principles.</P>
<P>The reader will be careful to ob&s;erve, that in this ar|ticle
we denominate every opinion a <HI>prejudice,</HI> which,
whether true or fal&s;e, is not founded upon argument, in
the mind of the per&s;on who entertains it.</P>

II. They who obey from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> that is to &s;ay, from con|&s;cience
as in&s;tructed by rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions of their
own, are determined, by the con&s;ideration of the nece&s;&s;ity
of &s;ome government or other&mdash;the certain mi&s;chief of
civil commotions&mdash;and the danger of re&s;ettling the go|vernment
of their country better, or at all, if once &s;ub|verted
or di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>III. They who obey from <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t,</HI> are kept in order
by want of lei&s;ure; by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of private cares, plea|&s;ures,
and engagements; by contentment, or a &s;en&s;e of
the ea&s;e, plenty, and &s;afety they enjoy; or la&s;tly, and
principally, by fear, fore&s;eeing they would bring them|&s;elves
by re&s;i&s;tance into a wor&s;e &s;ituation than their pre&s;ent,
ina&s;much as the &s;trength of government, each di&s;contented
&s;ubject reflects, is greater than his own, and he knows not
that others would join him. This la&s;t con&s;ideration has
often been called the <HI>opinion of power.</HI></P>
<P>This account of the principles by which mankind are
retained in their obedience to civil government, may &s;ug|ge&s;t
the following cautions:</P>
<P>1. Let civil governors learn from hence to re&s;pect their
&s;ubjects; let them be admoni&s;hed, that <HI>the phy&s;ical &s;trength
re&s;ides in the governed;</HI> that this &s;trength wants only to be
felt and rou&s;ed to lay pro&s;trate the mo&s;t ancient and con|firmed
dominion; that civil authority is founded in opi|nion;
that general opinion therefore ought always to be
<PB N="411" REF="449">
treated with deference, and managed with delicacy and
circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The opinion of right</HI> always following <HI>the cu&s;tom,</HI> being
for the mo&s;t part founded in nothing el&s;e, and lending one
principal &s;upport to government, every innovation in the
con&s;titution, or, in other words, in the cu&s;tom of govern|ing,
dimini&s;hes the &s;tability of government. Hence &s;ome
ab&s;urdities are to be retained, and many &s;mall inconveniencies
endured in every country, rather than that the u&s;age &s;hould be
violated, or the cour&s;e of public affairs diverted from their
old and &s;mooth channel. Even <HI>names</HI> are not indifferent.
When the multitude are to be dealt with, there is a <HI>charm</HI>
in &s;ounds. It was upon this principle, that &s;everal &s;tate&s;|men
of tho&s;e times advi&s;ed <HI>Cromwell</HI> to a&s;&s;ume the title of
King, together with the ancient &s;tyle and <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of royal|ty.
The minds of many, they contended, would be
brought to acquie&s;ce in the authority of a King, who &s;u&s;|pected
the office, and were offended with the admini&s;tra|tion
of a Protector. Novelty reminded them of u&s;urpation.
The adver&s;aries of this de&s;ign oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure, from
the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion of the efficacy of names and forms,
jealous left the veneration paid to the&s;e, &s;hould add an in|fluence
to the new &s;ettlement, which might en&s;nare the
liberty of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Government may be too &s;ecure.</HI> The greate&s;t tyrants
have been tho&s;e, who&s;e titles were the mo&s;t unque&s;tioned.
Whenever therefore the opinion of right becomes too pre|dominant
<PB N="412" REF="450">
and &s;uper&s;titious, it is abated by <HI>breaking the cu&s;|tom.</HI>
Thus the Revolution broke the <HI>cu&s;tom of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI>
and thereby moderated both in the prince and people, tho&s;e
lofty notions of hereditary right, which in the one were
become a continual temptation to tyranny, and di&s;po&s;ed
the other to invite &s;ervitude, by undue compliances, and
dangerous conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>4. As ignoranee of union, and want of communica|tion,
appear among&s;t the principal pre&s;ervatives of civil
authority, it behoves every &s;tate to keep its &s;ubjects in this
want and ignorance, not only by vigilance in guarding
again&s;t actual confederacies and combinations, but by a
timely care to prevent great collections of men of any &s;e|parate
party or religion, even of the &s;ame occupation or
profe&s;&s;ion, or in any way connected by a participation of
intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion, from &s;ettling in the &s;ame vicinity. A
prote&s;tant e&s;tabli&s;hment in this country may have little to
fear from its popi&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;cattered as they are through|out
the kingdom, and intermixed with the prote&s;tant in|habitants,
which yet might think them a formidable body,
if they were gathered together into one county. The mo&s;t
frequent and de&s;perate riots are tho&s;e, which break out
among&s;t men of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, as weavers, miners, &s;ai|lors.
This circum&s;tance makes a mutiny of &s;oldiers, more to
be dreaded than any other in&s;urrection. Hence al&s;o one dan|ger
of an overgrown metropolis, and of tho&s;e great cities,
and crouded di&s;tricts, into which the inhabitants of trading
countries are commonly collected. The wor&s;t effect of
<PB N="413" REF="451">
popular tumults con&s;i&s;ts in this, that they di&s;cover to the
in&s;urgents the &s;ecret of their own &s;trength, teach them to
depend on it again&s;t a future occa&s;ion, and diffu&s;e and produce
&s;entiments of confidence in one another, and a&s;&s;urances of
mutual &s;upport. Leagues thus formed and &s;trengthened,
may over-awe, or over-&s;et the power of the &s;tate, and the
danger is greater in proportion, as from the propinquity of
habitation, and intercour&s;e of employment, the pa&s;&s;ions
and coun&s;els of the party can be circulated with ea&s;e and
rapidity. It is by the&s;e means, and in &s;uch &s;ituations, that
the minds of men are &s;o affected and prepared, that the
mo&s;t dreadful uproars often ari&s;e from the &s;lighte&s;t provo|cations.&mdash;When
the train is laid, a &s;park will produce
explo&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Duty of Submi&s;&s;ion to Civil Government explained.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of this chapter is &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed
from the &s;ubject of the la&s;t, as the motives which
<HI>actually</HI> produce civil obedience, may be, and often are,
very different from the rea&s;ons which make that obedi|ence
a duty.</P>
<P>In order to prove civil obedience to be a moral duty, and
an obligation upon the con&s;cience of the &s;ubject, it hath
been u&s;ual with many political writers, at the head of
whom we find the venerable name of <HI>Locke,</HI> to &s;tate
a compact between the citizen and the &s;tate, as the ground
and cau&s;e of the relation between them; which compact
binding the parties, for the &s;ame general rea&s;on that pri|vate
contracts do, re&s;olves the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to civil
government into the univer&s;al obligation of fidelity in the
performance of promi&s;es. This compact is two-fold;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>An expre&s;s</HI> compact by the primitive founders of
the &s;tate, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have convened for the
declared purpo&s;e of &s;ettling the terms of their future union,
and a con&s;titution of government. The whole body is &s;up|po&s;ed
to have unanimou&s;ly con&s;ented, in the fir&s;t place, to
<PB N="415" REF="453">
be bound by the re&s;olutions of the majority; that majo|rity,
in the next place, to have fixed certain fundamental
regulations; and then to have con&s;tituted, either in one
per&s;on, or in an a&s;&s;embly (the rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or ap|pointment
being at the &s;ame time determined) a <HI>&s;tanding
legi&s;lature,</HI> to whom, under the&s;e pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed re&s;trictions,
the government of the &s;tate was thenceforward committed,
and who&s;e laws the &s;everal members of the convention
were, by their fir&s;t undertaking, thus per&s;onally engaged
to obey.&mdash;This tran&s;action is &s;ometimes called the <HI>&s;ocial
compact,</HI> and the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed original regulations compo&s;e
what are meant by the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> the <HI>fundamental laws of
the con&s;titution;</HI> and form on one &s;ide, the <HI>inherent indefea&s;ible
prerogative of the crown;</HI> and on the other, the unalienable
<HI>birthright</HI> of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Secondly, A <HI>tacit</HI> or <HI>implied</HI> compact, by all &s;ucceeding
members of the &s;tate, who, by accepting its protection,
con&s;ent to be bound by its laws; in like manner as who|ever
<HI>voluntarily enters</HI> into a private &s;ociety, is under&s;tood,
without any other or more explicit &s;tipulation, to promi&s;e
a conformity with the rules, and obedience to the govern|ment
of that &s;ociety, as the known conditions, upon which
he is admitted to a participation of its privileges.</P>
<P>This account of the &s;ubject, although &s;pecious, and pa|tronized
by names the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, appears to labour
under the following objections; that it is founded upon a
&s;uppo&s;ition fal&s;e in fact, in&s;ufficient, if it were true, for
<PB N="416" REF="454">
the purpo&s;es for which it is produced, and leading to dan|gerous
conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>No &s;ocial compact, &s;imilar to what is here de|&s;cribed,
was ever made or, entered into in fact; no &s;uch
original convention of the people was ever actually
held, or in any country could be held, antecedent to
the exi&s;tence of civil government in that country. It is
to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible to call &s;avages out of caves and
de&s;erts, to deliberate and vote upon topics, which the ex|perience,
and &s;tudies, and refinements of civil life alone
&s;ugge&s;t. Therefore no government in the univer&s;e began
from this original. Some imitation of a &s;ocial compact
may have taken place at a <HI>Revolution.</HI> The pre&s;ent age has
been witne&s;s to a tran&s;action, which bears the neare&s;t
re&s;emblance to this political idea, of any of which hi&s;tory
has pre&s;erved the account or memory. I refer to the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of the united &s;tates of <HI>North America.</HI> We
&s;aw the <HI>people</HI> a&s;&s;embled to elect deputies, for the avowed
purpo&s;e of framing the constitution of a new empire. We
&s;aw this deputation of the people deliberating and re&s;olv|ing
upon a form of government, erecting a permanent
legi&s;lature, distributing the functions of &s;overeignty, e&s;tab|lishing
and promulging a code of fundamental ordinances,
which were to be con&s;idered by &s;ucceeding generations,
not merely as laws and acts of the &s;tate, but as the very
terms and conditions of the confederation, as binding not
only upon the &s;ubjects and magi&s;trates of the &s;tate, but as
limitations of power, which were to controul and regulate
<PB N="417" REF="455">
the future legi&s;lature.&mdash;Yet even here much was pre&s;up|po&s;ed.&mdash;In
&s;ettling the constitution many important parts
were pre&s;umed to be already &s;ettled&mdash;the qualifications of
the con&s;tituents who were admitted to vote in the elec|tion
of members of Congre&s;s, as well as the mode of
electing the repre&s;entatives, were taken from the old
forms of government. That was wanting from which
every &s;ocial union &s;hould &s;et off, and which alone makes
the re&s;olutions of the &s;ociety the act of the individual,
the unconstrained con&s;ent of all, to be bound by the de|ci&s;ion
of the majority; and yet, without this previous
con&s;ent, the revolt, and the regulations which followed
it, were compul&s;ory upon di&s;&s;entients.</P>
<P>But the original compact, we are told, is not propo&s;ed as
a <HI>fact,</HI> but as a fiction, which furni&s;hes a commodious ex|plication
of the mutual rights and duties of &s;overeigns and
&s;ubjects. In an&s;wer to this repre&s;entation of the matter
we ob&s;erve, that the original compact, if it be not a fact, <HI>is
nothing,</HI> can confer no actual authority upon laws or ma|gi&s;trates,
nor afford any foundation to rights, which are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be real and exi&s;ting. But the truth is, that in
the books, and in the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e who deduce
our civil rights and obligations <HI>a pactis,</HI> the original con|vention
is appealed to and treated of as a reality. When|ever
the di&s;ciples of this &s;y&s;tem &s;peak of the con&s;titution;
of the fundamental articles of the con&s;titution; of
laws being con&s;titutional or uncon&s;titutional; of inhe|rent,
unalienable, inextingui&s;hable rights, either in the
prince, or the people; or indeed of any laws, u&s;ages, or
<PB N="418" REF="456">
civil rights, as tran&s;cending the authority of the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing
legi&s;lature, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a force and &s;anction &s;uperior
to what belong to the modern acts and edicts of the legi|&s;lature,
they &s;ecretly refer us to what pa&s;&s;ed at the ori|ginal
convention. They would teach us to believe, that
certain rules and ordinances were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
people, at the &s;ame time that they &s;ettled the charter of
government, and the powers as well as the form of the
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting legi&s;lature, which, con&s;equently deriving its
commi&s;&s;ion and exi&s;tence from the con&s;ent and act of the
primitive a&s;&s;embly (of which indeed it is only the &s;tand|ing
deputation) continues &s;ubject in the exerci&s;e of its of|fices,
and as to the extent of its power, to the rules, re&s;er|vations,
and limitations which the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly then made
and pre&s;cribed to it.</P>
<P>&startq; As the fir&s;t members of the &s;tate were bound by
expre&s;s &s;tipulation to obey the government which they
had erected, &s;o the &s;ucceeding inhabitants of the &s;ame
country are under&s;tood to promi&s;e allegiance to the con|&s;titution
and government they find e&s;tabli&s;hed, by ac|cepting
its protection claiming its privileges, and ac|quie&s;cing
in its laws; more e&s;pecially, by the purcha&s;e
or inheritance of lands, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, alle|giance
to the &s;tate is annexed, as the very &s;ervice and
condition of the tenure.&endq; Smoothly as this train of
argument proceeds, little of it will endure examination.
The native &s;ubjects of modern &s;tates are not con&s;cious of
any &s;tipulation with their &s;overeigns, of ever exerci&s;ing an
<PB N="419" REF="457">
election whether they will be bound or not by the acts of
the legi&s;lature, of any alternative being propo&s;ed to their
choice, of a promi&s;e either required or given, nor do they
apprehend that the validity and authority of the laws de|pend
at all upon <HI>their</HI> recognition or con&s;ent. In all
&s;tipulations, whether they be expre&s;&s;ed or implied, pri|vate
or public, formal or con&s;tructive, the parties &s;tipu|lating
mu&s;t both po&s;&s;e&s;s the liberty of a&s;&s;ent and refu&s;al,
and al&s;o be con&s;cious of this liberty, which cannot with
truth be affirmed of the &s;ubjects of civil government, as
government is now, or ever was actually administered.
This is a defect, which no arguments can excu&s;e or &s;up|ply;
all pre&s;umptions of con&s;ent, without this con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s,
or in oppo&s;ition to it, are vain and erroneous. Still
le&s;s is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile with any idea of &s;tipulation
the practice in which all <HI>European</HI> nations agree, of found|ing
allegiance upon the circum&s;tance of nativity, that is,
of claiming, and treating as &s;ubjects, all tho&s;e who are
born within the confines of their dominions, although re|moved
to another country in their youth or infancy. In
this in&s;tance, certainly the &s;tate does not pre&s;ume a com|pact.
Al&s;o if the &s;ubject be bound only by his own con|&s;ent,
and if the voluntary abiding in a country be the
proof and intimation of that con&s;ent, by what arguments
&s;hall we defend the right, which &s;overeigns univer&s;ally
a&s;&s;ume, of prohibiting, when they plea&s;e, the departure
of their &s;ubjects out of the realm?</P>
<P>Again, when it is contended that the taking and hold|ing
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land amounts to an acknowledgment of
<PB N="420" REF="458">
the &s;overeign, and a virtual promi&s;e of allegiance to his
laws, it is nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of the argument to
prove, that the inhabitants, who fir&s;t compo&s;ed and con|&s;tituted
the &s;tate, collectively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a right to the &s;oil
of the country&mdash;a right to parcel it out to whom they
plea&s;ed, and to annex to the donation what conditions they
thought fit. How came they by this right? An agree|ment
among&s;t them&s;elves would not confer it: that could
only adju&s;t what already belonged to them. A &s;ociety of
men vote them&s;elves to be the owners of a region of the
world;&mdash;does that vote, unaccompanied e&s;pecially with any
culture, inclo&s;ure, or proper act of occupation, make it
theirs? does it entitle them to exclude others from it, or to
dictate the conditions upon which it &s;hall be enjoyed? Yet
this original collective right and ownership, is the foun|dation
of all the rea&s;oning by which the duty of allegiance
is inferred from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land.</P>
<P>The theory of government which affirms the exi&s;tence
and the obligation of a &s;ocial compact, would, after all,
have merited little di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and however groundle&s;s and
unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould have received no oppo&s;ition from us,
did it not appear to lead to conclu&s;ions unfavourable to the
improvement, and to the peace, of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>1&s;t. Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that government was fir&s;t
erected by, and derives all its ju&s;t authority from the
re&s;olutions entered into by a convention of the people,
it is capable of being pre&s;umed, that many points were
<PB N="421" REF="459">
&s;ettled by that convention, anterior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting legi&s;lature, and which the legi&s;lature, con&s;e|quently,
has no right to alter, or interfere with. The&s;e
points are called the fundamentals of the con&s;titution, and
as it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine how many, or what they
are, the &s;ugge&s;ting of any &s;uch, &s;erves extremely to em|barra&s;s
the deliberations of the legi&s;lature, and affords a
dangerous pretence for di&s;puting the authority of the laws.
It was this &s;ort of rea&s;oning (&s;o far as rea&s;oning of any
kind was employed in the que&s;tion) that produced in this
nation the doubt, which &s;o much agitated the minds of
men in the reign of the <HI>&s;econd Charles,</HI> whether an <HI>Act of
Parliament</HI> could of right alter or limit <HI>the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
Crown.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. If it be by virtue of a compact, that the &s;ubject
owes obedience to civil government, it will follow, that he
ought to abide by the form of government he finds e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
be it ever &s;o ab&s;urd, or inconvenient. He is
bound by his bargain. It is not permitted to any man to
retreat from his engagement, merely becau&s;e he finds the
performance di&s;advantageous, or becau&s;e he has an oppor|tunity
of entering into a better. This law of contracts is
univer&s;al: and to call the relation between the &s;overeign
and the &s;ubject a contract, yet not to apply to it the rules,
or allow of the effects of a contract, is an arbitrary u&s;e of
names, and an un&s;teadine&s;s in rea&s;oning, which can teach
nothing. Re&s;i&s;tance to the encroachments of the &s;upreme
magi&s;trate may be ju&s;tified upon this principle; recour&s;e
<PB N="422" REF="460">
to arms, for the purpo&s;e of bringing about an amendment
of the con&s;titution, never can. No form of government
contains a provi&s;ion for its own di&s;&s;olution; and few go|vernors
will con&s;ent to the extinction, or even to any
abridgement of their own power. It does not therefore
appear, how de&s;potic governments can ever in con&s;i&s;tency
with the obligation of the &s;ubject be changed, or mitigat|ed.
De&s;poti&s;m is the con&s;titution of many &s;tates: and
whil&s;t a de&s;potic prince exacts from his &s;ubjects the mo&s;t
rigorous &s;ervitude, according to this account, he is only
holding them to their agreement. They may vindicate
the rights, which the con&s;titution has left them, by force,
but every attempt to narrow the prerogative of the crown,
by new limitations, and in oppo&s;ition to the will of the
reigning prince, whatever opportunities may invite, or
&s;ucce&s;s follow it, mu&s;t be condemned as an infraction of
the compact between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>3dly. <HI>Every violation of the compact on the part of the go|vernors
relea&s;es the &s;ubject from his allegiance, and di&s;&s;olves the
government.</HI> I do not perceive how we can avoid this con|&s;equence,
if we found the duty of allegiance upon com|pact,
and confe&s;s any analogy between the &s;ocial compact
and other contracts. In private contracts, the violation or
non-performance of the conditions, by one of the parties,
vacates the obligation of the other. Now the terms and
articles of the &s;ocial compact being no where extant or
expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;the rights and offices of the admini&s;trator of
an empire being &s;o many and various&mdash;the imaginary and
<PB N="423" REF="461">
controverted line of his prerogative being &s;o liable to be
over&s;tepped in one part or other of it&mdash;the po&s;ition that
every &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion amounts to a forfeiture of the go|vernment,
and con&s;equently authorizes the people to with|draw
their obedience and provide for them&s;elves by a new
&s;ettlement, would endanger the &s;tability of every political
fabric in the world, and has in fact always &s;upplied the
di&s;affected with a topic of &s;editious declamation. If occa|&s;ions
have ari&s;en, in which this plea has been re&s;orted to
with ju&s;tice and &s;ucce&s;s, they have been occa&s;ions, in
which a revolution was defen&s;ible upon other and plainer
principles. The plea it&s;elf, is at all times captious and un&s;afe.</P>
<P>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact, as
unfounded in its principle, and dangerous in the applica|tion,
we a&s;&s;ign for the only ground of the &s;ubjects'
obligation, THE WILL OF GOD AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</P>
<P>The &s;teps by which the argument proceeds are few and
direct. &startq;It is the will of God that the happine&s;s of hu|man
life be promoted&endq;&mdash;this is the fir&s;t &s;tep, and the
foundation not only of this, but of every moral conclu&s;ion.
&startq;Civil &s;ociety conduces to that end&endq;&mdash;this is the &s;econd
propo&s;ition. &startq;Civil &s;ocieties cannot be upheld, unle&s;s
in each, the intere&s;t, of the whole &s;ociety be binding
upon every part and member of it&endq;&mdash;this is the third
<PB N="424" REF="462">
&s;tep, and conducts us to the conclu&s;ion, namely, &startq;that
&s;o long as the intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety requires it,
that is, &s;o long as the e&s;tabli&s;hed government cannot be
re&s;i&s;ted or chantged without public inconveniency, it is
the will of God (which <HI>will</HI> univer&s;ally determines our
duty) that the e&s;tabli&s;hed government be obeyed&endq;&mdash;and
no longer.</P>
<P>This principle being admitted, the ju&s;tice of every particular ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, is reduced to a computation of the
quantity of the danger and grievance on the one &s;ide, and
of the probability and expence of redre&s;&s;ing it on the
other.</P>
<P>But who &s;hall judge of this? <HI>Every man for him&s;elf.</HI> In
contentions between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject, the
parties acknowledge no common arbitrator, and it would
be ab&s;urd to commit the deci&s;ion to: <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who&s;e conduct
has provoked the que&s;tion, and who&s;e own intere&s;t, au|thority,
and fate, are immediately concerned in it. The
danger of error and abu&s;e, is no objection to the rule of
expediency, becau&s;e every other rule is liable to the &s;ame
or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon
the &s;ubject (like all rules which appeal to or bind the con|&s;cience)
mu&s;t in the application depend upon private judg|ment.
It may be ob&s;erved, however, that it ought equally
to be accounted the exerci&s;e of a man's private judgment,
whether he be determined by rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions
<PB N="425" REF="463">
of his own, or &s;ubmit to be directed by the advice
of others,
provided he be free to chu&s;e his guide.</P>
<P>We proceed to point out &s;ome ea&s;y but important infer|ences,
which re&s;ult from the &s;ub&s;titution of <HI>public expedi|ency,</HI>
in the place of all implied compacts, promises, or
conventions what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I. It may be as much a duty, at one time, to re&s;i&s;t go|vernment,
as it is at another, to obey it&mdash;to wit, whenever
more advantage will, in our opinion, accrue to the community
from re&s;i&s;tance, than mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>II. The lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance, or of a revolt, does not
depend alone upon the grievance which is &s;u&s;tained or
feared, but al&s;o upon the probable expence and event of
the conte&s;t. They who concerted the Revolution in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
were clearly ju&s;tifiable in their coun&s;els, becau&s;e from
the di&s;po&s;ition of the nation, and the &s;trength and character
of the parties, the mea&s;ure was likely to be brought about
with little mi&s;chief or blood&s;hed; whereas it might have
been a que&s;tion with many friends of their country, whe|ther
the injuries then endured and threatened, would have
authorized the renewal of a doubtful civil war.</P>
<P>III. Irregularity in the fir&s;t foundation of a &s;tate, or &s;ub|&s;equent
violence, fraud, or inju&s;tice in getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the &s;upreme power, are not &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for re&s;i&s;t|ance,
after the government is once peaceably &s;ettled. No

&s;ubject of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire conceives him&s;elf engaged to
vindicate the ju&s;tice of the <HI>Norman</HI> claim or conque&s;t, or
apprehends that his duty in any manner depends upon that
controver&s;y. So likewi&s;e if the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> or
even the po&s;terity of <HI>Cromwell</HI> had been at this day &s;eated
upon the throne of <HI>England,</HI> we &s;hould have been as little
concerned to enquire how the founder of the family came
there. No civil conte&s;ts are &s;o futile, although none have
been &s;o furious and &s;anguinary, as as tho&s;e which are ex|cited
by a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IV. Not every inva&s;ion of the &s;ubjects' rights, or liber|ty,
or of the con&s;titution; not every breach of promi&s;e,
or of oath; not every &s;tretch of prerogative, abu&s;e of
power, or neglect of duty by the chief magi&s;trate, or by
the whole or any branch of the legi&s;lative body, ju&s;tifies
re&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s the&s;e crimes draw after them public con|&s;equences of &s;ufficient magnitude to outweigh the evils
of civil disturbance. Neverthele&s;s, every violation of the
con&s;titution ought to be watched with jealou&s;y, and re|&s;ented
as &s;uch, beyond what the quantity of damage &s;u&s;|tained
would require or warrant; becau&s;e a known and
&s;ettled u&s;age of governing affords the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t
the enormities of uncontrolled dominion, and becau&s;e this
&s;ecurity is weakened by every encroachment which is made
without oppo&s;ition, or oppo&s;ed without effect.</P>
<P>V. No u&s;age, law, or authority whatever, is &s;o bind|ing,
that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be
<PB N="427" REF="467">
changed with advantage to the community. The family
of the prince, the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the prerogative of
the crown, the form and parts of the legi&s;lature, together
with the re&s;pective powers, office, duration, and mutual
dependency of the &s;everal parts, are all only &s;o many <HI>laws,</HI>
mutable like other laws, whenever expediency requires,
either by the ordinary act of the legi&s;lature, or if the occa|&s;ion
de&s;erve it, by the interpo&s;ition of the people. The&s;e
points are want to be approached with a kind of awe, they
are repre&s;ented to the mind as principles of the con&s;titu|tion
&s;ettled by our ance&s;tors, and being fettled to be no
more committed to innovation or debate; as foundations
never to be &s;tirred; as the terms and conditions of the &s;o|cial
compact, to which every citizen of the &s;tate has en|gaged
his fidelity, by virtue of a promi&s;e, which he can|not
now recall. Such rea&s;ons have no place in our &s;y&s;tem;
to us, if there be any good rea&s;on for treating the&s;e with
more deference and re&s;pect than other laws, it is, either
the advantage of the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of government
(which rea&s;on mu&s;t be of different force in different coun|tries)
or becau&s;e, in all countries, it is of importance, that
the form and u&s;age of governing be acknowledged and
under&s;tood, as well by the governors as the governed, and
becau&s;e, the &s;eldomer it is changed the more it will be re|&s;pected
by both &s;ides.</P>
<P>VI. As all civil obligation is re&s;olved into expediency,
what difference is there between the obligation of an Eng|li&s;hman
and a Frenchman? in other words, why is a
<PB N="428" REF="468">
Frenchman bound in con&s;cience to bear any thing from
his King, which an Engli&s;hman is not bound to bear, &s;ince
the obligation of both is founded in the &s;ame rea&s;on?
Their conditions may differ, but their <HI>rights</HI> according to
this account &s;hould &s;eem to be equal; and yet we are ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;peak of the <HI>rights</HI> as well as of the happine&s;s of
a free people, compared with what belong to the &s;ubjects
of ab&s;olute monarchies.&mdash;How can this compari&s;on be ex|plained,
unle&s;s we refer to a difference in the compacts,
by which they are re&s;pectively bound? This is a fair que&s;|tion,
and the an&s;wer to it will afford a farther illu&s;tration
of our principles. There are then many things which a
Frenchman is bound in con&s;cience, as well as by coercion,
to endure at the hands of his prince, to which an Engli&s;h|man
would not be obliged to &s;ubmit, but it is for the&s;e
two rea&s;ons alone; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame act of the prince
is not the &s;ame grievance where it is agreeable to the con|&s;titution, as where it infringes it: <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> becau&s;e redre&s;s
in the two ca&s;es is not equally attainable. Re&s;i&s;tance can|not
be attempted with equal hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, or the &s;ame
pro&s;pect of receiving &s;upport from others, where the peo|ple
are reconciled to their &s;ufferings, as where they are
alarmed by innovation. In this way, and no otherwi&s;e,
the &s;ubjects of different &s;tates have different civil rights;
the duty of obedience is defined by different boundaries,
and the point of ju&s;tifiable re&s;i&s;tance placed at different
parts of the <HI>&s;cale</HI> of &s;uffering&mdash;all which is &s;ufficiently in|telligible
without a &s;ocial compact.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="469">
VII. <HI>The intere&s;t of the whole &s;ociety is binding upon every
part of it.</HI> No rule, &s;hort of this, will provide for the &s;ta|bility
of civil government, or for the peace and &s;afety of
&s;ocial life. Wherefore, as individual members of the
&s;tate are not permitted to pur&s;ue their private emolument
to the prejudice of the community, &s;o is it equally a con|&s;equence
of this rule, that no particular colony, province,
town, or di&s;trict, can ju&s;tly concert mea&s;ures for their &s;e|parate
intere&s;t, which &s;hall appear at the &s;ame time to
dimini&s;h the <HI>&s;um</HI> of public pro&s;perity. I do not mean, that
it is nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;tice of a mea&s;ure, that it profit each
and every part of the community; for as the happine&s;s of
the whole may be increa&s;ed, whil&s;t that of &s;ome parts is
dimini&s;hed, it is po&s;&s;ible, that the conduct of one part of an empire,
may be detrimental to &s;ome other part, and yet
ju&s;t, provided one part gain more in happine&s;s, than the
other part lo&s;es, &s;o that the common weal be augmented by
the change: but what I affirm is, that tho&s;e coun&s;els can
never be reconciled with the obligations re&s;ulting from
civil union, which cau&s;e the <HI>whole</HI> happine&s;s of the &s;o|ciety
to be impaired for the conveniency of <HI>a part.</HI> This
conclu&s;ion is applicable to the que&s;tion of right between
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and her revolted colonies. Had I been an
<HI>American,</HI> I &s;hould not have thought it enough, to have
had it even demon&s;trated, that a &s;eparation from the pa|rent
&s;tate would produce effects beneficial to <HI>America;</HI> my
relation to that &s;tate impo&s;ed upon me a farther enquiry,
whether the whole happine&s;s of the empire was likely to
be promoted by &s;uch a mea&s;ure&mdash;not indeed the happine&s;s
<PB N="430" REF="470">
of every part, that was not nece&s;&s;ary or to be expected&mdash;but
whether what <HI>Great Britain</HI> would lo&s;e by the &s;epara|tion,
was likely to be compen&s;ated to the joint &s;tock of
happine&s;s, by the advantages which <HI>America</HI> would receive
from it. The conte&s;ted claims of &s;overeign &s;tates, and
their remote dependencies, may be &s;ubmitted to the adjudi|cation
of this rule with mutual &s;afety. A public advan|tage,
is mea&s;ured by the advantage each individual re|ceives,
and the number of tho&s;e who receive it. A public
evil is compounded of the &s;ame proportions. Whil&s;t,
therefore, a colony is &s;mall, or a province thinly inha|bited,
if a competition of intere&s;ts ari&s;e between the ori|ginal
country and their acquired dominions, the former
ought to be preferred, becau&s;e it is fit, that if one mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be &s;acrificed, the le&s;s give place to the greater:
but when, by an increa&s;e of population, the intere&s;t of
the provinces begins to bear a con&s;iderable proportion to
the <HI>entire</HI> intere&s;t of the community, it is po&s;&s;ible that
they may &s;uffer &s;o much by their &s;ubjection, that not only
their's, but the whole happine&s;s of the empire may be ob|&s;tructed
by their union. The rule and principle of the
calculation being &s;till the &s;ame, the <HI>re&s;ult</HI> is different;
and this difference begets a new &s;ituation, which en|titles
the &s;ubordinate parts of the &s;tate to more equal
terms of confederation, and, if the&s;e be refu&s;ed, to
independency.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty of Civil Obedience as &s;tated in the Chri&s;tian Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WE affirm, that as to the <HI>extent</HI> of our civil rights
and obligations, <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> hath left us where &s;he
found us&mdash;that &s;he hath neither altered, nor a&s;certained
it&mdash;that the New Te&s;tament contains not one pa&s;&s;age,
which fairly interpreted, affords either argument or objec|tion
applicable to any conclu&s;ions upon the &s;ubject, that
are deduced from the law and religion of nature.</P>
<P>The only pa&s;&s;ages which have been &s;eriou&s;ly alledged in
the controver&s;y, or which it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to &s;tate and
examine, are the two following; the one extracted from
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the other from the Fir&s;t
General Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<Q>Romans xiii. I&mdash;7.</Q>
<P>&startq;Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God; the powers that be,
are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the
power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God: and they that
<PB N="432" REF="472">
re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation. For rulers
are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which
is good, and thon &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame: for he
is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. But if thou
do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the
&s;word in vain: for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger
to <HI>execute</HI> wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore
ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o
for con&s;cience &s;ake. For, for this cau&s;e pay you tribute
al&s;o: for they are God's mini&s;ters, attending continually
upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their
dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom

<Q>I. PETER, ii. 13&mdash;18.</Q>
<P>&startq;Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the

unto Governors, as unto them that are &s;ent by him for
the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them

men: as free, and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloak of
maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God.&endq;</P>
<P>To comprehend the proper import of the&s;e in&s;trtucions,
let the reader reflect, that upon the &s;ubject of civil obedi|ence
there are two que&s;tions; the fir&s;t, whether to obey
government be a moral duty and obligation upon the
<PB N="433" REF="473">
con&s;cience at all; the &s;econd, how far, and to what ca&s;es,
that obedience ought to extend;&mdash;that the&s;e two que&s;tions,
are &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hable in the imagination, that it is po&s;&s;ible
to treat of the one, without any thought of the other;
and la&s;tly, that if expre&s;&s;ions which relate to one of the&s;e
que&s;tions be transferred and applied to the other, it is with
great danger of giving them a &s;ignification very different
from the author's meaning. This di&s;tinction is not only
po&s;&s;ible, but natural. If I met with a per&s;on, who ap|peared
to entertain doubts, whether civil obedience were a
moral duty which ought to be voluntarily di&s;charged, or
whether it were not a mere &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to force, like that,
which we yield to a robber, who holds a pi&s;tol to our
brea&s;t; I &s;hould repre&s;ent to him the u&s;e and offices of
civil government, the end and the nece&s;&s;ity of civil &s;ubjec|tion;
or, if I preferred a different theory, I &s;hould explain
to him the &s;ocial compact, urge him with the obligation
and the equity of his implied promi&s;e, and tacit con&s;ent to
be governed by the laws of the &s;tate from which he received
protection; or I &s;hould argue, perhaps, that Nature her|&s;elf
dictated the law of &s;ubordination, when &s;he planted
within us an inclination to a&s;&s;ociate with our &s;pecies, and
framed us with capacities &s;o various and unequal.&mdash;From
whatever principle I &s;et out, I &s;hould labour to infer from
it this conclu&s;ion, &startq;that obedience to the &s;tate, is to be
numbered among&s;t the relative duties of human life,
for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of which, we &s;hall be accountable at
the tribunal of divine ju&s;tice, whether the magi&s;trate,
be able to puni&s;h us for it or not;&endq; and being arrived
<PB N="434" REF="474">
at this conclu&s;ion, I &s;hould &s;top, having delivered the con|clu&s;ion it&s;elf, and throughout the whole argument expre&s;|&s;ed
the obedience, which I inculcated, in the mo&s;t general
and unqualified terms, all re&s;ervations and re&s;trictions be|ing
&s;uperfluous, and foreign to the doubts I was employed
to remove.</P>
<P>If in a &s;hort time afterwards, I &s;hould be acco&s;ted by
the &s;ame per&s;on, with complaints of public grievances
and apprehen&s;ions of exorbitant taxes, of acts of cruelty
and oppre&s;&s;ion, of tyrannical encroachments upon the an|cient
or &s;tipulated rights of the people, and &s;hould be con|&s;ulted
whether it were lawful to revolt, or ju&s;tifiable to
join in an attempt to &s;hake off the yoke, and provide
again&s;t the approaching danger, by open re&s;i&s;tance; I
&s;hould certainly con&s;ider my&s;elf as having a ca&s;e and que&s;|tion
before me very different from the former. I &s;hould
now define and di&s;criminate. I &s;hould reply, that if pub|lic
expediency be the foundation, it is al&s;o the mea&s;ure of
civil obedience; that the obligation of &s;ubjects and &s;ove|reigns
is reciprocal; that the duty of allegiance, whether
it be founded in utility or compact, is neither unlimited
nor unconditional;&mdash;that peace may be purcha&s;ed too
dear; that patience becomes culpable pu&s;illanimity, when
it &s;erves only to encourage our rulers to increa&s;e the weight
of our burthen, or to bind it the fa&s;ter; that the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
which &s;urrenders the liberty of a nation, and entails
&s;lavery upon future generations, is enjoined by no law of
rational morality: finally, I &s;hould in&s;truct him to com|pare
<PB N="435" REF="475">
the peril and expence of his enterprize, with the
effects it was expected to produce, and to make choice of
the alternative, by which not his own pre&s;ent relief or
profit, but the whole and permanent intere&s;t of the &s;tate
was likely to be be&s;t promoted. If any one who had been
pre&s;ent at both the&s;e conver&s;ations &s;hould upbraid me with
change or incon&s;i&s;tency of opinion, &s;hould retort upon
me the pa&s;&s;ive doctrine I before taught, the large and ab|&s;olute
terms in which I then delivered le&s;&s;ons of obedience
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould account my&s;elf unfairly dealt
with. I &s;hould reply, that the only difference which the
language of the two conver&s;ations pre&s;ented was, that I
added now many exceptions and limitations, which were
omitted or unthought of then&mdash;that this difference aro&s;e
naturally from the two occa&s;ions, &s;uch exceptions being
as nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent conference, as
they would have been &s;uperfluous and un&s;ea&s;onable in the
former. Now the difference in the&s;e two conver&s;ations
is preci&s;ely the di&s;tinction to be taken in interpreting tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, concerning which we are debating.
They inculcate the <HI>duty,</HI> they do not de&s;cribe the <HI>extent</HI> of
it&mdash;they enforce the obligation by the proper &s;anctions of
Chri&s;tianity, without intending either to enlarge or con|tract,
without con&s;idering indeed the limits by which it is
bounded. This is al&s;o the method, in which the &s;ame
Apo&s;tles enjoin the duty of &s;ervants to their ma&s;ters; of
children to their parents; of wives to their hu&s;bands.
&startq;Servants be &s;ubject to your ma&s;ters.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Children
obey your parents in all things.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Wives &s;ubmit
<PB N="436" REF="476">
your&s;elves unto your own husbands.&endq; The &s;ame con|ci&s;e
and ab&s;olute form of expre&s;&s;ion, occurs in all the&s;e
precepts; the &s;ame &s;ilence, as to any exceptions or di&s;tinc|tions;
yet no one doubts, but that the commands of
ma&s;ters, parents, and hu&s;bands, are often &s;o immoderate,
unju&s;t, and incon&s;i&s;tent with other obligations, that they
both may and ought to be re&s;i&s;ted. In letters or differta|tions
written profe&s;&s;edly upon &s;eparate articles of morality,
we might with more rea&s;on have looked for a preci&s;e de|lineation
of our duty, and &s;ome degree of modern accu|racy
in the rules which were laid down for our direction;
but in tho&s;e &s;hort collections of practical maxims, which
compo&s;e the conclu&s;ion, or &s;ome &s;mall portion, of a doc|trinal
or perhaps controver&s;ial epi&s;tle, we cannot be &s;ur|prized
to find the author more &s;olicitous to impre&s;s the
duty, than curious to enumerate exceptions.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of this di&s;tinction, is alone &s;ufficient
to vindicate the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, from any explana|tion,
which may be put upon them, in favor of an unli|mited
pa&s;&s;ive obedience. But if we be permitted to a&s;&s;ume
a &s;uppo&s;ition, which many commentators proceed upon as
a certainty, that the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians privately cheri&s;hed an
opinion, that their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity entitled them to
new immunities, to an exemption as of <HI>right</HI> (however
they might give way to nece&s;&s;ity) from the authority of
the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;overeign, we are furni&s;hed with a &s;till more apt
and &s;atisfactory interpretation of the Apo&s;tles' words. The
two pa&s;&s;ages apply with great propriety to the refutation
<PB N="437" REF="477">
of this error; they teach the Chri&s;tian convert to obey the
magi&s;trate &startq;for the Lord's &s;ake,&endq;&mdash;&startq;not only for wrath
but for con&s;cience &s;ake.&endq;&mdash;&startq;that there is no power but
of God&endq;&mdash;&startq;that the powers that be,&endq; even the pre&s;ent
rulers of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, though$heathens and u&s;urpers,
&s;eeing they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the actual and nece&s;&s;ary
authority of civil government &startq;are ordained of God,&endq; and
con&s;equently, entitled to receive obedience from tho&s;e who
profe&s;s them&s;elves the peculiar &s;ervants of God, in a greater (certainly not in a le&s;s) degree, than from any
others. They briefly de&s;cribe the office of civil governors,
&startq;the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and the prai&s;e of them
that do well;&endq; from which de&s;cription of the u&s;e of go|vernment,
they ju&s;tly infer the duty of &s;ubjection, which
duty being as exten&s;ive, as the rea&s;on upon which it is
founded, belongs to Chri&s;tians no le&s;s than to the heathen
members of the community. If it be admitted, that the
two Apo&s;tles wrote with a view to this particular que&s;tion,
it will be confe&s;&s;ed, that their words cannot be transferred
to a que&s;tion totally different from this, with any certain|ty
of carrying along with us their authority and intention.
There exi&s;ts no re&s;emblance between the ca&s;e of a primitive
convert who di&s;puted the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Roman</HI> govern|ment
over a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;tianity, and <HI>his,</HI> who
acknowledging the general authority of the &s;tate over all
its &s;ubjects, doubts, whether that authority be not in &s;ome
important branch of it, &s;o ill con&s;tituted or abu&s;ed, as to
warrant the endeavours of the people to bring about a
reformation by force: Nor can we judge what reply the
<PB N="438" REF="478">
Apo&s;tles would have made to this <HI>&s;econd</HI> que&s;tion, if it had
been propo&s;ed to them, from any thing they have deli|vered
upon the <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> any more than in the two con&s;ulta|tions
above de&s;cribed, it could be known beforehand,
what I would &s;ay in the latter, from the an&s;wer which I
gave to the former.</P>
<P>The only defect in this account is, that neither the &s;criptures,
nor any &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory of the early ages of
the church, furni&s;h any direct atte&s;tation of the exi&s;tence
of &s;uch di&s;affected &s;entiments among&s;t the primitive con|verts.
They &s;upply indeed &s;ome circum&s;tances, which
render the opinion probable, that extravagant notions of
the political rights of the Chri&s;tian &s;tate were at that time
entertained by many pro&s;elytes to the religion. From the
que&s;tion propo&s;ed to Chri&s;t, &startq;Is it lawful to give tribute
unto Caefar?&endq; it may be pre&s;umed that doubts had been
&s;tarted in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;chools concerning the obligation, or
even the lawfulne&s;s of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Roman</HI> yoke.
The accounts delivered by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> of various in&s;urrections
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> of that, and the following age, excited by
this principle, or upon this pretence, confirm the pre|&s;umption.
Now as the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were at fir&s;t chiefly taken
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> confounded with them by the re&s;t of the
world, and from the affinity of the two religions, apt to
intermix the doctrines of both, it is not to be wondered at,
that a tenet, &s;o flattering to the &s;elf-importance of tho&s;e
who embraced it, &s;hould have been communicated to the
new in&s;titution. Again, the teachers of Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="439" REF="479">
among&s;t the privileges which their religion conferred up|on
its profe&s;&s;ors, were wont to extoll the &startq;<HI>liberty</HI> into
which they were called,&endq;&mdash;&startq;in which Chri&s;t had made
them free.&endq; This liberty, which was intended of a
deliverance from the various &s;ervitude, in which they had
heretofore lived, to the domination of &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, to
the &s;uper&s;tition of the <HI>Gentile</HI> idolatry, or the incumbered
ritual of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, might by &s;ome be inter|preted
to &s;ignify an emancipation from all re&s;traint, which
was impo&s;ed by an authority merely human. At lea&s;t they
might be repre&s;ented by their enemies as maintaining no|tions
of this dangerous tendency. To &s;ome error or ca|lumny
of this kind, the words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;eem to allude:
&startq;For &s;o is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may
put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men: as free,
and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s,
(i. e. &s;edition) but as the &s;ervants of God.&endq; After all,
if any one think, this conjecture too feebly &s;upported by
te&s;timony, to be relied upon in the interpretation of &s;crip|ture,
he will then revert to the con&s;iderations alledged in
the preceding part of this chapter.</P>
<P>After &s;o copious an account of what we apprehend to be
the general de&s;ign and doctrine of the&s;e much agitated pa&s;|&s;ages,
little need be added in explanation of particular
clau&s;es. St. <HI>Paul</HI> has &s;aid, &startq;who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the
power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God.&endq; This phra&s;e,
&startq;the ordinance of God,&endq; is by many &s;o interpreted as to
authorize the mo&s;t exalted and &s;uper&s;titious ideas of the
<PB N="440" REF="480">
regal character. But, &s;urely, &s;uch interpreters have &s;acri|ficed
truth to adulation.&mdash;For in the fir&s;t place, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
as u&s;ed by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> is ju&s;t as applicable to one
kind of government and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is to another&mdash;to the
elective magi&s;trates of a pure republic, as to an ab&s;olute
hereditary monarch:&mdash;in the next place, it is not affirmed
of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate exclu&s;ively, that <HI>he</HI> is the ordi|nance
of God; the title, whatever it imports, belongs
with equal propriety to the inferior officers of the &s;tate.
The divine right of <HI>Kings,</HI> is, like the divine right of <HI>Con|&s;tables,</HI>
the law of the land, or even actual and quiet
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their office, a right, ratified we humbly pre|&s;ume
by the divine approbation, &s;o long as obedience to
their authority appears to be nece&s;&s;ary, or conducive to
the common welfare. Princes are ordained of God by
virtue only of that general decree, by which he a&s;&s;ents,
and adds the &s;anction of his will, to every law of &s;ociety,
which promotes his own purpo&s;e, the communication of
human happine&s;s: according to which idea of their origin
and con&s;titution, and without any repugnancy to the
words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> they are by St. <HI>Peter</HI> denominated the
<HI>ordinance of man.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Civil Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>CIVIL Liberty is the not being re&s;trained by any Law, but what conduces in a greater degree to the public welfare.</P>
<P>To do what we will is natural liberty; to do what we
will, con&s;i&s;tently with the intere&s;t of the community
to which we belong, is civil liberty; that is to &s;ay, the
only liberty to be de&s;ired in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hould wi&s;h, no doubt, to be allowed to act in every
in&s;tance as I plea&s;ed, but I reflect that the re&s;t al&s;o of
mankind would then do the fame; in which &s;tate of uni|ver&s;al
independence and &s;elf-direction I &s;hould meet with &s;o
many checks and ob&s;tacles to my own will, from the
interference and opposition of other men's, that not only
<PB N="442" REF="482">
my happine&s;s, but my liberty, would be le&s;s, than whil&s;t
the whole community are &s;ubjected to the dominion of
equal laws.</P>
<P>The boa&s;ted liberty of a &s;tate of nature exi&s;ts only in a
&s;tate of &s;olitude. In every kind and degree of union and
communication with his &s;pecies, the liberty of the indi|vidual
is augmented by the very laws which re&s;train it;
becau&s;e he gains more from the limitation of other men's
freedom than he &s;uffers by the diminution of his own.
Natural liberty is the right of common upon a wa&s;te;
civil liberty is the &s;afe, exclu&s;ive, unmole&s;ted enjoyment
of a cultivated inclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The definition of civil liberty above laid down, imports
that the laws of a free people impo&s;e no re&s;traints upon the
private will of the &s;ubject, but what conduce in <HI>a greater
degree</HI> to the public happine&s;s: by which it is intimated,
1 &s;t, that re&s;traint it&s;elf is an evil; 2dly, that this evil
ought to be overbalanced by &s;ome public advantage; 3dly,
that the proof of this advantage lies upon the legi&s;lature&mdash;it
is not enough to &s;ay that a law is harmle&s;s; its being a
law is a harm; 4thly, that a law being found to produce no
&s;en&s;ible good effects is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for repealing it, as
adver&s;e and injurious to the rights of a free citizen, with|out
demanding &s;pecific evidence of its bad effects.&mdash;This
maxim might be remembered with advantage in a revi&s;ion
of many laws of this country; e&s;pecially the game laws&mdash;the
poor laws, &s;o far as they lay re&s;trictions upon the poor
<PB N="443" REF="483">
them&s;elves&mdash;the laws again&s;t papi&s;ts and di&s;&s;enters: and
among&s;t a people enamoured to exce&s;s and jealous of their
liberty, it &s;eems a matter of &s;urprize that this principle
has been &s;o imperfectly attended to.</P>
<P>The degree of actual liberty always bearing, according
to this account of it, a rever&s;ed proportion to the number
and &s;everity of the <HI>re&s;trictions</HI> which are either u&s;ele&s;s, or
who&s;e utility does not outweigh the evil of the re&s;traint;
it follows that every nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome, no nation per|fect
liberty; that this liberty may be enjoyed under every
form of Government; that it may be impaired indeed,
or increa&s;ed; but that it is neither gained, nor lo&s;t, nor
recovered, by any &s;ingle regulation, change, or event
whatever; that con&s;equently, tho&s;e popular phra&s;es which
&s;peak of a free people; of a nation of &s;laves; which call one
revolution the aera of liberty; or another the lo&s;s of it;
with many expre&s;&s;ions of a like ab&s;olute form, are intelli|gible
only in a comparative &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we are enabled to apprehend the distinction
between per&s;onal and civil liberty. A citizen of the free&s;t
republic in the world may be impri&s;oned for his crimes,
and though his per&s;onal freedom be re&s;trained by bolts and
fetters, &s;o long as his confinement is the effect of a be|neficial
public law, his civil liberty is not invaded. If this
in&s;tance appear dubious, the following will be plainer.
A pa&s;&s;enger from the Levant, who, upon his return to
England, should be conveyed to a lazaretto by an order of
<PB N="444" REF="484">
quarantine, with whatever impatience he might de&s;ire his
enlargement, and though he &s;aw a guard placed at the door
to oppo&s;e his e&s;cape, or even ready to de&s;troy his life if he
attempted it, would hardly accu&s;e government of in|croaching
upon his civil freedom; nay, might, perhaps,
rather congratulate him&s;elf that he had at length &s;et his
foot again in a land of liberty. The manife&s;t expediency
of the mea&s;ure not only ju&s;tifies it, but reconciles the mo&s;t
odious confinement with the perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the
loftie&s;t notions of civil liberty. And if this be true of the
coercion of a pri&s;on, that it is compatible with a &s;tate of
<HI>civil</HI> freedom; it cannot with rea&s;on be di&s;puted of tho&s;e
more moderate con&s;traints which the ordinary operation of
government impo&s;es upon the will of the individual. It is
not the rigour, but the inexpediency of laws and acts of
authority, which makes them tyranical.</P>
<P>There is another idea of civil liberty, which, though
neither &s;o &s;imple nor &s;o accurate as the former, agrees
better with the &s;ignification, which the u&s;age of common
di&s;cour&s;e, as well as the example of many re&s;pectable wri|ters
upon the &s;ubject, has affixed to the term. This idea
places liberty in &s;ecurity; making it to con&s;i&s;t not merely
in an actual exemption from the con&s;traint of u&s;ele&s;s and
noxious laws and acts of dominion, but in being free from
the <HI>danger</HI> of having any &s;uch hereafter impo&s;ed or
exerci&s;ed. Thus, &s;peaking of the political &s;tate of modern
Europe, we are accu&s;tomed to &s;ay of Sweden, that &s;he lo&s;t
her <HI>liberty</HI> by the revolution which lately took place in that
<PB N="445" REF="485">
country; and yet we are a&s;&s;ured that the people continue
to be governed by the &s;ame laws as before, or by others
which are wi&s;er, milder, or more equitable. What then
have they lo&s;t? They have lo&s;t the power and functions of
their diet; the con&s;titution of their &s;tates and orders,
who&s;e deliberation and concurrence were required in the
formation and e&s;tablishment of every public law; and
thereby have parted with the &s;ecurity they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t
any attempts of the crown to harra&s;s its &s;ubjects, by op|pre&s;&s;ive
and u&s;ele&s;s exertions of prerogative. The lo&s;s of
this &s;ecurity we denominate the lo&s;s of liberty. They
have changed not their laws, but their legi&s;lature; not their
enjoyment, but their &s;afety; not their pre&s;ent burthens,
but their pro&s;pects of future grievances: and this we pro|nounce
a change from the condition of freemen to that of
&s;laves. In like, manner, in our own country, the act of
parliament, in the reign of Henry the eighth, which gave
to the king's proclamation the force of law, has properly
been called a complete and formal &s;urrender of the liberty
of the nation; and would have been &s;o, although no procla|mation
were i&s;&s;ued in pur&s;uance of the&s;e new powers, or
none but what was recommended by the highe&s;t wi&s;dom
and utility. The &s;ecurity was gone. Were it probable,
that the welfare and accommodation of the people would
be as &s;tudiou&s;ly, and as providently, con&s;ulted in the edicts
of a de&s;potic prince, as by the re&s;olutions of a popular a&s;|&s;embly,
then would an ab&s;olute form of government be no
le&s;s free than the pure&s;t democracy. The different degree
of care and knowledge of the public intere&s;t which may
<PB N="446" REF="486">
rea&s;onably be expected from the different form and com|po&s;ition
of the legi&s;lature, constitutes the di&s;tinction, in
re&s;pect of liberty, as well between the&s;e two extremes, as
between all the intermediate modifications of civil govern|ment.</P>
<P>The definitions which have been framed of civil liberty,
and which have been made the &s;ubject of much unnece&s;&s;ary
altercation, are mo&s;t of them adapted to this idea. Thus
one political writer makes the very e&s;&s;ence of the &s;ubject's
liberty to con&s;i&s;t in his being governed by no laws but
tho&s;e to which he hath actually con&s;ented; another is &s;a|tisfied
with a virtual and indirect con&s;ent; another again
places civil liberty in the &s;eparation of the legi&s;lative and
executive offices of government; another in the being go|verned
by <HI>law,</HI> that is, by known, precon&s;tituted, inflex|ible
rules of action and adjudication; a fifth in the exclu&s;ive
right of the people to tax them&s;elves by their own repre|&s;entatives;
a &s;ixth in the freedom and purity of elections of
repre&s;entatives; a &s;eventh in the controll which the demo|cratic
part of the con&s;titution po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over the military
e&s;tabli&s;hment. Concerning which, and &s;ome other &s;imilar
accounts of civil liberty, it may be ob&s;erved, that they all
labour under one inaccuracy, viz. that they do not &s;o much
de&s;cribe liberty it&s;elf, as the &s;afeguards and pre&s;ervatives of
liberty: for example, a man's being governed by no laws,
but tho&s;e to which he has given his con&s;ent, were it
<PB N="447" REF="487">
practicable, is no otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoyment of
civil liberty, than as it affords a probable &s;ecurity again&s;t
the dictation of laws, impo&s;ing arbitrary and &s;uperfluous
re&s;trictions upon his private will. This remark is applica|ble
to the re&s;t. The diver&s;ity of the&s;e definitions will not
&s;urpri&s;e us, when we con&s;ider that there is no contrariety
or oppo&s;ition among&s;t them whatever; for by how many
different provi&s;ions and precautions civil liberty is fenced
and protected, &s;o many different accounts of liberty it&s;elf,
all &s;ufficiently con&s;i&s;tent with truth and with each other,
may, according to this mode of explaining the term, be
framed and adopted.</P>
<P>Truth cannot be offended by a definition, but propriety
may. In which view tho&s;e definitions of liberty ought to
be rejected, which by making that e&s;&s;ential to civil freedom
which is unattainable in experience, inflame expectations
that can never be gratified, and di&s;turb the public content
with complaints, which no wi&s;dom or benevolence of go|vernment
can remove.</P>
<P>It will not be thought extraordinary, that an idea, which
occurs so much oftener as the &s;ubject of panegyric, and
carele&s;s declamation, than of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, or correct
knowledge, &s;hould be attended with uncertainty and con|fu&s;ion;
or that it &s;hould be found impo&s;&s;ible to contrive a
definition, which may include the numerous, un&s;ettled,
and ever varying &s;ignifications, which the term is made to
<PB N="448" REF="488">
&s;tand for, and at the &s;ame time accord with the condition
and experience of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>Of the two ideas that have been &s;tated of civil liberty,
whichever we a&s;&s;ume, and whatever rea&s;oning we found
upon them, concerning its extent, nature, value and pre&s;er|vation,
this is the conclusion:&mdash;that <HI>that</HI> people, govern|ment,
and con&s;titution, is the <HI>free&s;t,</HI> which makes the be&s;t
provi&s;ion for the enacting of expedient and &s;alutary laws.</P>

<P>AS a &s;eries of appeals mu&s;t be finite, there nece&s;&s;arily

<P>I. De&s;poti&s;m, or ab&s;olute MONARCHY, where the legi&s;|lature

<P>II. An ARISTOCRACY, where the legislature is in a &s;e|lect

<P>The &s;eparate advantages of MONARCHY, are unity of

the&s;e are the dangers to be provided again&s;t in each&mdash;Thus,
if &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch be truly enumerated among&s;t
the &s;eparate excellencies of regal government; then a mixed
government, which retains monarchy in one part of its
con&s;titution, &s;hould be careful that the other e&s;tates of
<PB N="453" REF="493">
the empire do not interpo&s;e delays, or di&s;cover what it is
expedient to conceal, by an officious and inqui&s;itive inter|ference
with the executive functions, which are, or ought
to be, re&s;erved to the admini&s;tration of the prince. On the
other hand, if profu&s;ion, exaction, military domination,
and needle&s;s wars, be ju&s;tly accounted natural properties of
monarchy, in its &s;imple unqualified form; then are
the&s;e the objects to which, in a mixed government, the
ari&s;tocratic and popular parts of the con&s;titution ought to
direct their vigilance; the dangers again&s;t which they
&s;hould erect and fortify their barriers:&mdash;these are depart|ments
of &s;overeignty, over which a power of in&s;pection
and control ought to be depo&s;ited with the people.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be repeated of all the other
advantages and inconveniencies which have been a&s;cribed
to the &s;everal &s;imple forms of government; and affords a
rule whereby to direct the con&s;truction, improvement,
and admini&s;tration of mixed governments, &s;ubjected howe|ver
to this remark, that a quality &s;ometimes re&s;ults from
the conjunction of two &s;imple forms of government,
which belongs not to the &s;eparate exi&s;tence of either: thus
corruption, which has no place in an ab&s;olute monarchy,
and little in a pure republic, is &s;ure to gain admi&s;&s;ion into
a con&s;titution, which divides the &s;upreme power between
an executive magistrate and a popular council.</P>
<P>An <HI>hereditary</HI> MONARCHY is univer&s;ally to be preferred
to an <HI>elective</HI> monarchy&mdash;the confe&s;&s;ion of every writer
<PB N="454" REF="494">
upon the &s;ubject of civil government, the experience of
ages, the example of Poland, and the papal dominions,
&s;eem to place this among&s;t the few indubitable maxims
which the &s;cience of politics admits of&mdash;A crown is too
&s;pendid a prize to be conferred upon merit&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ions
or interests of the electors exclude all con&s;ideration of the
qualities of the competitors. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds
of the appointment to any office which is attended with a
great &s;hare of power and emolument. Nothing is gained
by a popular choice worth the di&s;&s;en&s;ions, tumults, and
interruption of regular indu&s;try, with which it is in&s;e|parably
attended. Add to this, that a king, who owes
his elevation to the event of a conte&s;t, or to any other
cau&s;e than a fixed rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will be apt to regard
one part of his &s;ubjects as the a&s;&s;ociates of his for|tune,
and the other as conquered foes. Nor &s;hould it be
forgotten, among&s;t the advantages of, an <HI>hereditary</HI> mo|narchy,
that as plans of national improvement and re|form
are &s;eldom brought to maturity by the exertions of
a &s;ingle reign, a nation cannot attain to the degree of
happine&s;s and pro&s;perity which it is capable of enjoying,
unle&s;s an uniformity of councils, a con&s;i&s;tency of public
mea&s;ures and de&s;igns be continued through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
ages. This benefit of a con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of government,
may be expected, with greater probability, where the &s;u|preme
power de&s;cends in the &s;ame race, and each prince
&s;ucceeds, in &s;ome &s;ort, to the di&s;po&s;ition of his ance&s;tor,
than where the crown, at every change, devolves upon a
&s;tranger, who&s;e fir&s;t care is commonly to pull down what
<PB N="455" REF="495">
his predece&s;&s;or had built up; and to &s;ub&s;titute &s;y&s;tems of
admini&s;tration, which, in their turn, give way to the
more favourite novelties of the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>ARISTOCRACIES are of two kinds, fir&s;t, where the power
of the nobility belongs to them in their collective capacity
alone; that is, where although the government re&s;ide in
an a&s;&s;embly of the order, yet the members of the a&s;&s;em|bly
&s;eparately and individually po&s;&s;e&s;s no authority or privi|lege
beyond the re&s;t of the community:&mdash;this de&s;cribes
the con&s;titution of Venice. Secondly, where the nobles are
&s;everally inve&s;ted with great per&s;onal power and immuni|ties,
and where the power of the &s;enate is little more than
the aggregated power of the individuals who compo&s;e it:&mdash;this
is the con&s;titution of Poland. Of the&s;e two forms of
government, the fir&s;t is the mo&s;t tolerable; for al|though
the members of the &s;enate should many, or even all
of them, be profligate enough to abu&s;e the authority of
their &s;tations in the pro&s;ecution of private de&s;igns, yet,
not being all under a temptation to the &s;ame inju&s;tice, not
having all the &s;ame end to gain, it would &s;till be difficult
to obtain the con&s;ent of a majority,, to any oppre&s;&s;ive mea|fure,
which the iniquity of an individual might prompt
him to propo&s;e: or if the will were the &s;ame, the power
to harra&s;s is more remote and confined; one tyrant, whe|ther
the tyranny re&s;ide in a &s;ingle per&s;on, or a &s;enate, can|not
exerci&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion at &s;o many places at the &s;ame time,
as it may be carried on by the dominion of a numerous
nobility over their re&s;pective va&s;&s;als and dependents. Of
<PB N="456" REF="496">
all &s;pecies of domination this is the mo&s;t odious:&mdash;the
freedom and &s;atisfaction of private life are more con&s;train|ed
and harra&s;&s;ed by it, than by the mo&s;t vexatious laws,
or even by the lawle&s;s will of an arbitrary monarch; from
who&s;e knowledge, and who&s;e inju&s;tice, the greate&s;t part of
his &s;ubjects are removed by their di&s;tance, or concealed
by their ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Europe exhibits more than one modern example, where
the people, aggrieved by the exactions, or provoked by
the enormities, of their immediate &s;uperiors, have joined
with the reigning prince in the overthrow of the ari&s;tocra|cy,
and deliberately exchanged their condition for the
mi&s;eries of de&s;poti&s;m. About the middle of the la&s;t cen|tury,
the commons of Denmark, weary of the oppre&s;|&s;ions
which they had long &s;uffered from the nobles, and
exa&s;perated by &s;ome recent in&s;ults, pre&s;ented them&s;elves
at the foot of the throne, with a formal offer of their
con&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h unlimited dominion in the king.
The revolution in Sweden, &s;till more lately, brought
about with the acquie&s;cence, not to &s;ay the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the people, owed its &s;ucce&s;s to the &s;ame cau&s;e, namely,
the pro&s;pect of deliverance, that it afforded, from the ty|ranny
which their nobles exerci&s;ed under the old con&s;titu|tion.
In England the people beheld the depre&s;&s;ion of the
Barons, under the hou&s;e of Tudor, with &s;atisfaction, al|though
they &s;aw the crown a&s;cending thereby to a height
of power which no limitations, that the con&s;titution had
then provided, were likely to confine. The le&s;&s;on to be
<PB N="457" REF="497">
drawn from &s;uch events is this, that a mixed govern|ment,
which admits a patrician order into its con&s;titution,
ought to circum&s;cribe the per&s;onal privileges of the nobi|lity,
e&s;pecially claims of hereditary juri&s;diction and local
authority, with a jealou&s;y proportioned to the &s;olicitude
with which it provides for its own pre&s;ervation. For no|thing
&s;o alienates the minds of the people, from the
government under which they live, by a perpetual &s;en&s;e of
annoyance and inconveniency; or &s;o prepares them for the
practices of an enterpri&s;ing prince, or a factious demagogue,
as the abu&s;e which almo&s;t always accompanies the exi&s;t|ence
of &s;eparate immunities.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the inferior, but by no means inconsiderable
advantages of a DEMOCRATIC constitution, or of a con&s;ti|tution
in which the people partake of the power of legi&s;|lation;
the following should not be neglected.</P>
<P>I. The direction which it gives to the education,
&s;tudies and pur&s;uits of the &s;uperior orders of the commu|nity.
The &s;hare which this has in forming the public
manners and character is very important. In countries,
in which the gentry are excluded from all concern in the
government, &s;carce any thing is left which leads to ad|vancement,
but the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. They who do
not addict them&s;elves to this profe&s;&s;ion, (and mi&s;erable
mu&s;t that country be, which con&s;tantly employs the mi|litary
&s;ervice of a great proportion of any order of its &s;ub|jects,)
are commonly lo&s;t by the mere want of object and
<PB N="458" REF="498">
destination; that is, they fall, without re&s;erve, into the
mo&s;t &s;otti&s;h habits of animal gratification, or entirely de|vote
them&s;elves to the attainment of tho&s;e futile arts and
exterior decorations, which compo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s and re|commendation
of a court: on the other hand; where the
whole, or any effective portion of civil power is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by a popular a&s;&s;embly, more &s;erious pur&s;uits will be en|couraged,
purer morals and a more intellectual character
will engage the public e&s;teem; that knowledge, and
tho&s;e faculties, which qualify men for deliberation and
debate, and which are the fruit of &s;ober habits, of early
and long continued application, will be rou&s;ed and ani|mated
by the reward, which, of all others, mo&s;t readily
awakens the ambition of the human mind, political di|gnity
and importance.</P>
<P>II. Popular elections procure to the common people
courte&s;y from their &s;uperiors. That contemptuous and
overbearing in&s;olence, with which the lower orders of
the community are wont to be treated by the higher, is
greatly mitigated where the people have &s;omething to
give. The a&s;&s;iduity, with which their favour is &s;ought
upon the&s;e occasions, &s;erves to generate &s;ettled habits of
conde&s;cen&s;ion and re&s;pect; and as human life is more em|bittered
by affronts than injuries, whatever contributes
to procure mildne&s;s and civility of manners, towards tho&s;e
who are mo&s;t liable to &s;uffer from a contrary behaviour,
corrects with the pride, in a great mea&s;ure, the evil of ine|quality,
<PB N="459" REF="499">
and de&s;erves to be accounted among&s;t the mo&s;t
generous in&s;titutions of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>III. The &s;atisfaction which people in free governments
derive from the knowledge and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of political &s;ub|jects;
of national mea&s;ures, and occurrences; the proceed|ings
and debates of the &s;enate; the conduct and character
of mini&s;ters; the revolutions, intrigues, and contentions
of parties; the agitation of public que&s;tions. Subjects of
this fort excite ju&s;t enough of intere&s;t and emotion, to af|ford
a moderate engagement to the thoughts, without ri|&s;ing
up to any painful degree of anxiety, or ever leaving
a fixed oppre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;pirits&mdash;and what is this, but
the aim and end of all tho&s;e amu&s;ements, which compo&s;e
&s;o much of the bu&s;ine&s;s of life and value of riches? For
my part, and I believe it to be the ca&s;e with mo&s;t men,
who are arrived at the middle age, and occupy the middle
cla&s;&s;es of life; had I all the money, which I pay in taxes
to government, at liberty to lay out upon amu&s;ement and
diver&s;ion, I know not whether I could make choice of
any, in which I &s;hould find greater plea&s;ure, than what
I receive from expecting, hearing, and relating public news;
reading parliamentary debates, and proceedings; can|va&s;&s;ing
the political arguments, projects, predictions and
intelligence, which are conveyed, by various channels, to
every corner of the kingdom. The&s;e topics, exciting
univer&s;al curio&s;ity, and being &s;uch as almo&s;t every man is
ready to form, and prepared to deliver an opinion about,
greatly promote, and, I think, improve conver&s;ation&mdash;
<PB N="460" REF="500">
they render it more rational and more innocent&mdash;they
&s;upply a &s;ub&s;titute for drinking, gaming, &s;candal, and
ob&s;cenity. Now the &s;ecrecy, the jealou&s;y, the &s;olitude
and precipitation of de&s;potic governments exclude all this.
But the lo&s;s, you &s;ay, is trifling. I know that it is po&s;|&s;ible
to render even the mention of it ridiculous, by re|pre&s;enting
it as the idle employment of the mo&s;t in&s;igni|ficant
part of the nation, the folly of village-&s;tate&s;men,
and coffee-hou&s;e politicians: but I allow nothing to be a
trifle, which mini&s;ters to the harmle&s;s gratification of mul|titudes;
nor any order of men to be in&s;ignificant, who&s;e
number bears a re&s;pectable proportion to the &s;um of the
whole community.</P>
<P>We have been accu&s;tomed to an opinion, that a REPUB|LICAN
form of government &s;uits only with the affairs of a
&s;mall &s;tate: which opinion is founded in the&s;e con&s;ider|ations,
that unle&s;s the people, in every di&s;trict of the em|pire,
be admitted to a &s;hare in the national repre&s;entation,
the government is not, as to <HI>them,</HI> a republic; that elec|tions,
where the con&s;tituents are numerous, and di&s;per&s;ed
through a wide extent of country, are conducted with
difficulty, or rather, indeed, managed by the intrigues, and
combination of a few, who are &s;ituated near the place of
election, each voter con&s;idering his &s;ingle &s;uffrage as too
minute a portion of the general intere&s;t to de&s;erve his care
or attendance, much le&s;s to be worth any oppo&s;ition to
influence and application; that whil&s;t we contract the re|pre&s;entation
within acompa&s;s &s;mall enough to admit of
<PB N="461" REF="501">
orderly debate, the intere&s;t of the con&s;tituent becomes too
&s;mall, of the repre&s;entative too great. It is difficult al&s;o to
maintain any connection between them. He who
repre|&s;ents
two hundred thou&s;and, is nece&s;&s;arily a &s;tranger to the
greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who elect him: and when his in|tere&s;t
among&s;t them cea&s;es to depend upon an acquaint|ance
with their per&s;ons and character, or a care and
knowledge of their affairs; when &s;uch a repre&s;entative
finds the trea&s;ures and honours of a great empire at the
di&s;posal of a few, and him&s;elf one of the few, there is
little rea&s;on to hope that he will not prefer to his public
duty, tho&s;e temptations of per&s;onal aggrandizement which
his &s;ituation offers, and which the price of his vote will
always purcha&s;e. All appeal to the people is precluded
by the impo&s;&s;ibility of collecting a &s;ufficient proportion of
their force and numbers. The factions, and the unanimi|ty
of the &s;enate are equally dangerous.&mdash;Add to the&s;e con|siderations,
that in a democratic constitution the mechan|ism
is too complicated, and the motions too flow for the
operations of a great empire; who&s;e defence and govern|ment
require execution and di&s;patch, in proportion to the
magnitude, extent, and variety of its intere&s;ts and con|cerns.&mdash;There
is weight, no doubt, in the&s;e rea&s;ons&mdash;but
much of the objection &s;eems to be done away by the contri|vance
of a <HI>federal</HI> republic, which, distributing the country
into districts of a commodious extent, and leaving to each its
internal legi&s;lation, re&s;erves only to a convention of the
&s;tates, the adju&s;tment of their relative claims; the levying,
direction and government of the common force of the con|federacy;
<PB N="462" REF="502">
the requi&s;ition of &s;ub&s;idies for the &s;upport of
this force; the making of peace and war; the entering
into treaties; the regulation of foreign commerce; the
equalization of duties upon imports, &s;o as to prevent the
defrauding of the revenue of one province by &s;muggling
articles of taxation from the borders of another; and like|wi&s;e,
&s;o as to guard again&s;t undue partialities in the en|couragement
of trade. To what limits &s;uch a republic
might, without inconvenience, enlarge its dominions, by
a&s;&s;uming into the confederacy neighbouring provinces; or
how far it would unite the liberty of a &s;mall common|wealth,
with the &s;afety of a powerful empire; or whether,
among&s;t co-ordinate powers, di&s;&s;en&s;ions and jealou&s;ies
would not be likely to ari&s;e, which, for want of a com|mon
&s;uperior, might proceed to fatal extremities, are
que&s;tions, upon which the records of mankind do not au|thorize
us to decide with tolerable certainty.&mdash;The experi|ment
is is about to be tried in America upon a large &s;cale.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the British Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>BY the con&s;titution of a country is meant &s;o much of
its law, as relates to the de&s;ignation and form of the
legi&s;lature; the rights and functions of the &s;everal parts
of the legi&s;lative body; the con&s;truction, office, and juri&s;|diction
of courts of ju&s;tice. The con&s;titution is one
principal divi&s;ion, head, &s;ection or title of the code
of public laws; di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t only by the
particular nature, or &s;uperior importance of the &s;ubject of
which it treats.&mdash;Therefore the terms <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> and
<HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> mean legal and illegal. The di&s;tinction
and the ideas, which the&s;e terms denote, are founded in the
&s;ame authority with the law of the land upon any other
&s;ubject; and to be a&s;certained by the &s;ame inquiries. The
&s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence is made up of acts of
parliament, of deci&s;ions of courts of law, and of imme|morial
u&s;ages: con&s;equently the&s;e are the principles of
which the con&s;titution it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts; the &s;ources from
which all our knowledge of its nature and limitations is
<PB N="464" REF="504">
to be deduced, and the authorities to which all appeal
ought to be made, and by which every con&s;titutional
doubt and que&s;tion can alone be decided. This plain and
intelligible definition is the more nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;erved
in our thoughts, as &s;ome writers upon the &s;ubject ab|&s;urdly
confound what is con&s;titutional, with what is ex|pedient;
pronouncing forthwith a mea&s;ure to be uncon&s;ti|tutional,
which they adjudge in any re&s;pect to be detri|mental
or dangerous: whil&s;t others again, a&s;cribe a kind
of tran&s;cendent authority, or my&s;terious &s;anctity, to the
con&s;titution, as if it were founded in &s;ome higher origi|nal
than that which gives force and obligation to the
ordinary laws and &s;tatutes of the realm, or were inviolable
on any other account than its intrin&s;ic utility. An act of
parliament, in England, can never be uncon&s;titutional,
in the &s;trict and proper acceptation of the term; in a lower
&s;en&s;e it may, viz. when it militates with the &s;pirit, con|tradicts
the analogy, or defeats the provi&s;ion of other
laws, made to regulate the form of government. Even
that flagitious abu&s;e of their tru&s;t, by which a parliament
of Henry the Eighth conferred upon the king's proclama|tion
the authority of law, was uncon&s;titutional only in
this latter &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who treat of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution,
con&s;ider it as a &s;cheme of government formally planned
and contrived by our ance&s;tors, in &s;ome certain aera of our
national hi&s;tory, and as &s;et up in pur&s;uance of &s;uch regular
plan and de&s;ign. Something of this &s;ort is &s;ecretly &s;up|po&s;ed,
<PB N="465" REF="505">
or referred to, in the expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who
&s;peak of the &startq;principles of con&s;tituton,&endq; of bringing
back the con&s;titution to its &startq;fir&s;t principles,&endq; of re&s;toring
it to its &startq;original purity,&endq; or primitive model." Now
this appears to me an erroneous conception of the &s;ubject.
No &s;uch plan was ever formed, con&s;equently no &s;uch fir&s;t
principles, original model, or &s;tandard, exi&s;t. I mean there
never was a date, or point of time in our hi&s;tory, when
the government of England was to be &s;et up a new, and
when it was referred to any &s;ingle per&s;on, or a&s;&s;embly, or
committee, to frame a charter for the future government
of the country; or when a con&s;titution, &s;o prepared and
dige&s;ted, was by common con&s;ent received and e&s;tabli&s;hed.
In the time of the civil wars, or rather between the death
of Charles the Fir&s;t, and the re&s;toration of his &s;on, many
&s;uch projects were publi&s;hed, but none carried into execu|tion.
The great charter, and the bill of rights, were
wi&s;e and &s;trenuous efforts to obtain &s;ecurity again&s;t certain
abu&s;es of regal power, by which the &s;ubject had been
aggrieved; but they were, either of them, much too par|tial
modifications of the con&s;titution to give it a new &s;et|tlement
or original. The con&s;titution of England, like
that of mo&s;t countries in Europe, hath grown out of oc|ca&s;ion
and emergency; from the various policy of differ|ent
ages; the contentions, &s;ucce&s;&s;es, intere&s;ts, and oppor|tunities
of different orders and parties of men in the com|munity.
It re&s;embles one of those old man&s;ions, which,
in&s;tead of being built at once, after a regular plan, and ac|cording
to the rules of architecture, has been reared in
<PB N="466" REF="506">
different ages of the art, altered from time to time, and
has been continually receiving additions and repairs
&s;uited
to the ta&s;te, fortune or conveniency of its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pro|prietors.
In &s;uch a building we look in vain for the ele|gance
and proportion, the ju&s;t order and corre&s;pondence
of parts, which we expect in a modern edifice; and which
external &s;ymetry, after all, contributes more perhaps to the
amu&s;ement of the beholder, than the accommodation of the
inhabitant.</P>
<P>In the Briti&s;h, and po&s;&s;ibly in all other con&s;titutions,
there exi&s;ts a wide difference between the actual &s;tate of
the government and the theory. The one re&s;ults from
the other; but &s;till they are different. When we con|template
the <HI>theory</HI> of the Briti&s;h government, we &s;ee the
King inve&s;ted with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute per&s;onal impunity;
with a power of rejecting laws, which have been re&s;olved
upon by both hou&s;es of parliament; of conferring by his
charter, upon any &s;et or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men he plea&s;es,
the privilege of &s;ending repre&s;entatives into one hou&s;e of
parliament, as by his immediate appointment he can place
whom he will in the other. What is this, a foreigner
might a&s;k, but a more circuitous de&s;poti&s;m? Yet, when
we turn our attention from the legal exi&s;tence to the ac|tual
exerci&s;e of royal authority in England, we &s;ee the&s;e
formidable prerogatives dwindled into mere ceremonies;
and in their &s;tead, a &s;ure and commanding influence, of
which the con&s;titution, it &s;eems, is totally ignorant, grow|ing
out of that enormous patronage, which the increa&s;ed
<PB N="467" REF="507">
extent, and opulence of the empire has placed in the di&s;|po&s;al
of the executive magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>Upon que&s;tions of government the habit of reflection
to be encouraged, is a &s;ober compari&s;on of our pre&s;ent
con&s;titution, not with models of &s;peculative perfection,
but with the actual chance of obtaining a better. This
turn of thought will generate a political di&s;po&s;ition,
equally removed from that puerile admiration, which &s;ees
no fault, and can endure no change, and that di&s;tempered
&s;en&s;ibility, which is alive only to perceptions of inconve|niency,
and too impatient to be delivered from its pre&s;ent
unea&s;ine&s;s, to compute either the peril, or expence of the
remedy. Political innovations commonly produce many
effects be&s;ides tho&s;e that are intended. The direct con&s;e|quence
is often the lea&s;t important. Incidental, remote,
and unthought of evils or advantages frequently exceed
the good that is de&s;igned, or the inconveniency that is
fore&s;een. It is from the &s;ilent and unob&s;erved operation;
the ob&s;cure progre&s;s of cau&s;es, &s;et at work for different
purpo&s;es, that the greate&s;t revolutions take their ri&s;e.
When the Barons, in the reign of Henry the Seventh,
&s;ued for the liberty of alienating their e&s;tates, they little
&s;u&s;pected, that they were petitioning for the downfall of
their order; or that they were laying the foundations of
de&s;poti&s;m, upon the ruins of the ari&s;tocracy. When
Elizabeth, and her immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or, applied them&s;elves
to the encouragement and regulation of trade by many
wi&s;e laws, they knew not, that, together with wealth
<PB N="468" REF="508">
and indu&s;try, they were diffu&s;ing a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
&s;trength and independency, which would not long endure,
under the forms of a mixed government, the dominion
of arbitrary princes. When it was debated whether the
mutiny act, the law by which the army is governed and
maintained, &s;hould be temporary or perpetual, little el&s;e
probably, occurred to the advocates of an annual bill, than
the expediency of retaining a control over the mo&s;t dan|gerous
prerogative of the crown&mdash;the direction and com|mand
of a &s;tanding army: whereas, in its effect, this
&s;ingle re&s;ervation has altered the whole frame and quality
of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. For &s;ince, in con&s;equence of
the military &s;y&s;tem, which prevails in neighbouring and
rival nations, as well as on account of the internal exigen|ces
of government, a &s;tanding army has become e&s;&s;ential
to the &s;afety and admini&s;tration of the empire, it enables
parliament, by di&s;continuing this nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, &s;o to
enforce its re&s;olutions upon any other &s;ubject, as to render
the king's di&s;&s;ent to a law, which has received the appro|bation
of both hou&s;es, too dangerous an experiment any
longer to be advi&s;ed. A conte&s;t between the king and
parliament, cannot now be per&s;evered in, without a di&s;|&s;olution of the government.&mdash;La&s;tly, when the con&s;titu|tion
conferred upon the crown the nomination to all em|ployments
in the public &s;ervice, the authors of this
arrangement were led to it, by the obvious propriety of
leaving to a ma&s;ter the choice of his &s;ervants; and the
manife&s;t inconveniency of engaging the national council,
upon every vacancy, in tho&s;e per&s;onal conte&s;ts which at|tend
<PB N="469" REF="509">
elections to places of honour and emolument. Our
ance&s;tors did not ob&s;erve that this di&s;po&s;ition would add
an influence to the regal office, which, as the number
and value of public employments increa&s;ed, would &s;uper|&s;ede
in a great mea&s;ure the forms, and change the charac|ter
of the ancient con&s;titution. They knew not, what
the experience and reflection of modern ages has di&s;co|vered,
that patronage univer&s;ally is power; that he who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a &s;ufficient degree the means of gratifying the
de&s;ires of mankind after wealth and di&s;tinction, by what|ever
checks and forms his authority may be limited or
di&s;gui&s;ed, will direct the management of public affairs.
Whatever be the mechani&s;m of the political engine, he
will guide the motion. The&s;e in&s;tances are adduced to
illu&s;trate the propo&s;ition we laid down, that, in politics,
the mo&s;t important and permanent effects have been,
for the mo&s;t part, incidental, and unfore&s;een: and this
propo&s;ition we would inculcate, for the &s;ake of the caution
which it teaches, that changes ought not to be adventur|ed
upon without a <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> di&s;cernment of the con|&s;equences,&mdash;without
a knowledge, as well of the remote
tendency, as the immediate de&s;ign. The courage of a
&s;tate&s;man &s;hould re&s;emble that of a commander, who,
however regardle&s;s of per&s;onal danger, never forgets, that
with his own he commits the lives and fortunes of a mul|titude;
and who does not con&s;ider it as any proof of zeal
or valour, to &s;take the &s;afety of <HI>other</HI> men, upon the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of a perilous or de&s;perate enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="510">
There is one end of civil government peculiar to a good
con&s;titution, namely, the happine&s;s of its &s;ubjects; there
is another end e&s;&s;ential to a good government, but com|mon
to it with many bad ones,&mdash;its own pre&s;ervation.
Ob&s;erving that the be&s;t form of government would be de|fective,
which did not provide for its own permanency,
in our political rea&s;onings we con&s;ider all &s;uch provi&s;ions
as expedient; and are content to accept as a &s;ufficient ex|cu&s;e
for any mea&s;ure, or regulation, that it is nece&s;&s;ary or
conducive to the &s;ecurity of the con&s;titution. Yet, in
truth, &s;uch provi&s;ions are ab&s;olutely expedient, and &s;uch an
excu&s;e final, only whil&s;t the con&s;titution is worth pre&s;erv|ing&mdash;that
is, until it can be exchanged for a better. I
premi&s;e this di&s;tinction, becau&s;e many things in the Eng|li&s;h,
as in every con&s;titution, are to be vindicated and ac|counted
for &s;olely from their tendency to maintain the
government in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and the &s;everal parts of it
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the powers which the con&s;titution has
a&s;&s;igned them; and becau&s;e I would wi&s;h it to be remarked
that &s;uch a con&s;ideration is always &s;ubordinate to another&mdash;the
value and u&s;efulne&s;s of the con&s;titution it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>The Government of England,</HI> which has been &s;ometimes
called a mixed government, &s;ometimes a limited monar|chy,
is formed by a combination of the three regular &s;pe|cies
of government; the monarchy, re&s;iding in the King;
the ari&s;tocracy, in the Hou&s;e of Lords; and the republic
being repre&s;ented by the Hou&s;e of Commons. The per|fection
intended by &s;uch a &s;cheme of government is, to
<PB N="471" REF="511">
unite the advantages of the &s;everal &s;imple forms, and to
exclude the inconveniences. To what degree this purpo&s;e
is attained or attainable in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; wherein
it is lo&s;t &s;ight of or neglected; and by what means it may
in any part be promoted with better &s;ucee&s;s, the reader
will be enabled to judge, by a &s;eparate recollection of
the&s;e advantages and inconveniences, as enumerated in the
preceding chapter, and a di&s;tinct application of each to the
political condition of this country. We will pre&s;ent our
remarks upon the &s;ubject in an enumeration of the expe|dients
by which the Briti&s;h con&s;titution provides.</P>
<P>1&s;t, For the intere&s;t of its &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>2dly, For its own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The contrivances for the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es are the
following:</P>
<P>In order to promote the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;alutary
public laws, every citizen of the &s;tate is capable of be|coming
a member of the &s;enate; and every &s;enator po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
the right of propounding to the deliberation of the legi&s;|lature
whatever law he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Every di&s;trict of the empire enjoys the privilege of
chu&s;ing repre&s;entatives, informed of the intere&s;ts and
circum&s;tances and de&s;ires of their constituents, and en|titled
by their &s;ituation to communicate that information
<PB N="472" REF="512">
to the national council. The meane&s;t &s;ubject has &s;ome
one whom he can call upon to bring forward his com|plaints
and reque&s;ts to public attention.</P>
<P>By annexing the right of voting for members of the
Hou&s;e of Commons to different qualifications in different
places, each order and profe&s;&s;ion of men in the commu|nity,
become virtually repre&s;ented; that is, men of all
orders and profe&s;&s;ions, &s;tate&s;men, courtiers, country
gentlemen, lawyers, merchants, manufacturers, &s;oldiers,
&s;ailors, intere&s;ted in the pro&s;perity, and experienced in
the occupation of their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions, obtain &s;eats
in parliament.</P>
<P>The elections, at the &s;ame time, are &s;o connected with
the influence of landed property as to afford a certainty
that a con&s;iderable number of men of great e&s;tates will be
returned to parliament; and are al&s;o &s;o modified, that
men the mo&s;t eminent and &s;ucce&s;sful in their re&s;pective
profe&s;&s;ions, are the mo&s;t likely, by their riches, or the
weight of their &s;tations, to prevail in the&s;e competitions.</P>
<P>The number, fortune, and quality of the members;
the variety of intere&s;ts and characters among&s;t them;
above all, the temporary duration of their power, and the
change of men which every new election produces, are &s;o
many &s;ecurities to the public, as well again&s;t the &s;ubjec|tion
of their judgments to any external dictation, as
<PB N="473" REF="513">
again&s;t the formation of a junto in their own body, &s;uf|ficiently
powerful to govern their deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entatives are &s;o intermixed with the con&s;ti|tuents,
and the con&s;tituents with the re&s;t of the people,
that they cannot, without a partiality too flagrant to be
endured, impo&s;e any burthen upon the &s;ubject, in which
they do not &s;hare them&s;elves; nor &s;carcely can they adopt
an advantageous regulation, in which their own intere&s;ts
will not participate of the advantage.</P>
<P>The proceedings and debates of parliament, and the
parliamentary conduct of each repre&s;entative, are known
by the people at large.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entative is &s;o far dependent upon the con&s;ti|tuent,
and political importance upon public favour, that
every &s;enator, by contriving and patronizing laws and
mea&s;ures of public utility, mo&s;t effectually recommends
him&s;elf to eminence and advancement in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>When intelligence of the condition, wants, and occa|&s;ions
of the people, is thus collected from every quarter,
and &s;o many under&s;tandings are &s;et at work upon the &s;ub|ject,
it may be pre&s;umed, that the mo&s;t eligible council,
expedient, remedy or improvement, will occur to &s;ome
one or other: and when a wi&s;e council, or beneficial regula|tion
is once &s;ugge&s;ted, it may be expected, from the di&s;|po&s;ition
of an a&s;&s;embly &s;o con&s;tituted as the Briti&s;h
<PB N="474" REF="514">
Hou&s;e of Commons is, that it cannot fail of receiving the
approbation of the majority.</P>
<P>To prevent tho&s;e de&s;tructive contentions for the &s;u|preme
power, which are &s;ure to take place, where the
members of the &s;tate do not live under an acknowledged
head, and a known rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; to pre&s;erve the
people in tranquillity at home, by a &s;peedy and vigorous
execution of the laws; to protect their intere&s;t abroad,
by &s;trength and energy in military operations, by tho&s;e
advantages of deci&s;ion, &s;ecrecy, and di&s;patch, which be|long
to the re&s;olutions of monarchical councils;&mdash;for the&s;e
purpo&s;es, the con&s;titution has committed the executive
government to the admini&s;tration and limited authority
of an hereditary King.</P>
<P>In the defence of the empire; in the maintenance of its
power, dignity, and privileges, with foreign nations; and
in the providing for the general admini&s;tration of muni|cipal
ju&s;tice, by a proper choice and appointment of ma|gi&s;trates,
the inclination of the king and of the people,
u&s;ually coincide: in this part, therefore, of the regal
office, the con&s;titution entru&s;ts the prerogative with
ample powers.</P>
<P>The dangers principally to be apprehended from regal
government, relate to the two articles, of taxation and
puni&s;hment. In every form of government, from which
the people are excluded, it is the intere&s;t of the governors
<PB N="475" REF="515">
to get as much, and of the governed to give as little as
they can: and the power of puni&s;hment, in the hands of
an arbitrary prince oftentimes becomes an engine of ex|tortion,
jealou&s;y, and revenge;&mdash;wi&s;ely therefore, hath
the Briti&s;h con&s;titution guarded the &s;afety of the people,
in the&s;e two points, by the mo&s;t &s;tudious precautions.</P>
<P>Upon that of taxation; every law, which, by the re|mote&s;t
con&s;truction, may be deemed to levy money upon
the property of the &s;ubject, mu&s;t originate, that is, mu&s;t
fir&s;t be propo&s;ed and a&s;&s;ented to, in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons:
by which regulation, accompanying the weight
which that a&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in all its functions, the
levying of taxes is almo&s;t exclu&s;ively re&s;erved to the po|pular
part of the con&s;titution, who it is pre&s;umed will not
tax them&s;elves, or their fellow &s;ubjects, without being
convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of the aids which they grant.</P>
<P>The application al&s;o of the public &s;upplies, is watched
with the &s;ame circum&s;pection, as the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. Many
taxes are annual; the produce of others, is mortgaged or
appropriated to &s;pecific &s;ervices; the expenditure of all of
them, is accounted for to the hou&s;e of commons; as
computations of the charge of the purpo&s;e, for which
they are wanted, are previou&s;ly &s;ubmitted to the &s;ame
tribunal.</P>
<P>In the infliction of puni&s;hment, the power of the crown
and of the magi&s;trate appointed by the crown, is confined
<PB N="476" REF="516">
by the mo&s;t preci&s;e limitations: the guilt of the offender
mu&s;t be pronounced by twelve men of his own order,
indifferently cho&s;en out of the county where the offence
was committed: the puni&s;hment, or the limits to which
the puni&s;hment may be extended, are a&s;certained and af|fixed
to the crime, by laws, which knew not the per&s;on
of the criminal.</P>
<P>And whereas the arbitrary and clande&s;tine &s;eizure and
confinement of the per&s;on is the injury mo&s;t to be dread|ed
from the &s;trong hand of the executive government,
becau&s;e it deprives the pri&s;oner at once of protection and
defence, and delivers him into the power, and to the ma|licious
or intere&s;ted de&s;igns of his enemies; the con&s;titu|tion
has provided again&s;t this danger with extreme &s;oli|citude.
The ancient writ of habeas corpus, the habeas
corpus act of Charles the Second, and the practice and
determinations of our &s;overeign courts of ju&s;tice founded
upon the&s;e laws, afford a complete remedy, for every con|ceivable
ca&s;e of illegal impri&s;onment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Upon complaint in writing by, or on behalf of any per&s;on in confine|ment, to any of the four courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, in term time, or to the Lord Chancellor, or one of the Judges, in the vacation; and upon a probable rea&s;on being &s;ugge&s;ted to que&s;tion the legality of the detention, a writ is i&s;&s;ued, to the per&s;on in who&s;e cu&s;tody the complainant is alledged to be, commanding him within a certain limited and &s;hort time to produce the body of the pri&s;oner, and the authority under which he is detained. Upon the return of the writ, &s;trict and in&s;tantaneous obedience to which is enforced by very &s;evere penalties, if no lawful cau&s;e of impri&s;onment appear, the court or judge, before whom the pri&s;oner is brought, is au|thorized and bound to di&s;charge him; even though he may have been com|mitted by a &s;ecretary, or other high officer of &s;tate, by the privy council, or by the King in per&s;on: &s;o that no &s;ubject of this realm can be held in confinement, by any power, or under any pretence whatever, provided he can find means to convey his complaint to one of the four courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, or, during their rece&s;s, to any of the Judges of the &s;ame, unle&s;s all the&s;e &s;everal tribunals agree in determining his impri&s;oment to be legal.

importance to the party than all the re&s;t, two witne&s;&s;es,

<P><PB N="478" REF="518">
We proceed, in the &s;econd place, to enquire in what
manner the con&s;titution has provided for its own pre&s;erva|tion;
that is, in what manner each part of the legi&s;lature
is &s;ecured in the exerci&s;e of the powers a&s;&s;igned to it,
from the incroachment of the other parts. This &s;ecurity
is &s;ometimes called the <HI>balance of the con&s;titution;</HI> and the
political equilibrium, which this phra&s;e denotes, con&s;i&s;ts
in two contrivances,&mdash;a balance of power, and a balance
of intere&s;t. By a balance of power is meant, that
there is no power po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one part of the legi&s;lature,
who&s;e abu&s;e, or exce&s;s, is not checked by &s;ome antagoni&s;t
power, re&s;iding in another part. Thus the power of the
two hou&s;es of parliament to frame laws is checked by the
king's negative; that if laws &s;ubver&s;ive of regal govern|ment
&s;hould obtain the con&s;ent of parliament, the reign|ing
prince, by interpo&s;ing his prerogative, may &s;ave the
nece&s;&s;ary rights and authority of his &s;tation. On the
other hand, the arbitrary application of this negative is
checked by the privilege which parliament po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of
refu&s;ing &s;upplies of money to the exigences of the King's
admini&s;tration. The con&s;titutional maxim, &startq;that the
king can do no wrong,&endq; is balanced by another maxim,
not le&s;s con&s;titutional, &startq;that the illegal commands of
the king, do not ju&s;tify tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t, or concur, in
carrying them into execution;&endq; and by a &s;econd rule, &s;ub|&s;idiary
to this, &startq;that the acts of the crown acquire not
any legal force, until authenticated by the &s;ub&s;cription of
&s;ome of its great officers.&endq; As the King could not be pun|i&s;hed,
without a civil war, the con&s;titution wi&s;ely exempts
<PB N="479" REF="519">
his per&s;on from trial or account; but, left this impunity
&s;hould encourage a licentious exerci&s;e of dominion, vari|ous
ob&s;tacles are oppo&s;ed to the private will of the &s;ove|reign,
when directed to illegal objects. The plea&s;ure
of the crown mu&s;t be announced with certain &s;olemnities,
and atte&s;ted by certain officers of &s;tate. In &s;ome ca&s;es,
the royal order mu&s;t be &s;ignified by a &s;ecretary of &s;tate; in
others, it mu&s;t pa&s;s under the privy &s;eal, and in many,
under the great &s;eal. And when the King's command is
regularly publi&s;hed, no mi&s;chief can be atchieved by it,
without the mini&s;try and compliance of tho&s;e to whom it
is directed. Now all who either concur in an illegal or|der,
by authenticating its publication with their &s;eal or
&s;ub&s;cription, or who a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of it, &s;ubject
them&s;elves to pro&s;ecution and puni&s;hment, for the part
they have taken; and are not permitted to plead or pro|duce
the command of the king, in ju&s;tification of their
obedience. And, that the crown may not protect its &s;er|vants,
in a criminal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their matter's de&s;ires,
by the power, which in general belongs to its authority, of
pardoning offences, and of remitting the &s;entence of the
law, pro&s;ecutions by impeachment, which is the u&s;ual
way of proceeding again&s;t offenders of this &s;ort, are ex|cepted
out of that prerogative<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t the checks, which parliament holds over the admini&s;tration of public affairs, I forbear to mention the practice of addre&s;&s;ing the King, to know by who&s;e advice he re&s;olved upon a particular mea&s;ure, and of puni&s;hing the authors of that advice, for the council they had given. Not becau&s;e I think this method either uncon&s;titutional or improper, but for this rea&s;on, that it does not &s;o much &s;ubject the king to the control of par|liament, as it &s;uppo&s;es him to be already in &s;ubjection. For if the King were &s;o far out of the reach of the re&s;entment of the hou&s;e of commons, as to be able, with &s;afety, to refu&s;e the information reque&s;ted, or to take upon him&s;elf the re&s;pon&s;ibility inquired after, there mu&s;t be an end of all proceedings founded in this mode of application.</NOTE>.&mdash;The power of the crown
<PB N="480" REF="520">
to direct the military force of the kingdom, is balanc|ed
by the annual nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;orting to parliament for
the maintenance and government of that force. The
power of the king to declare war, is checked by the pri|vilege
of the hou&s;e of commons, to grant or withhold
the &s;upplies by which the war mu&s;t be carried on. The
king's choice of his mini&s;ters is controlled by the obli|gation
he is under of appointing tho&s;e men to offices in
the &s;tate, who are found capable of managing the affairs
of his government, with the two hou&s;es of parliament.
Which con&s;ideration impo&s;es &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity upon the
crown, as hath in a great mea&s;ure &s;ubdued the influence
of favouriti&s;m; in&s;omuch, that it is become no uncom|mon
&s;pectacle in this country, to &s;ee men promoted by
the king to the highe&s;t offices, and riche&s;t preferments,
which he has in his power to be&s;tow, who have been di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by their oppo&s;ition to his per&s;onal inclinations.</P>
<P>By the <HI>balance of intere&s;t,</HI> which accompanies and gives
efficacy to the <HI>balance of power,</HI> is meant this, that the
re&s;pective intere&s;ts of the three e&s;tates of the empire are &s;o
di&s;po&s;ed and adju&s;ted, that whichever of the three &s;hall
<PB N="481" REF="521">
attempt any encroachment, the other two will unite in
re&s;i&s;ting it. If the king &s;hould endeavour to extend his
authority, by contracting the power and privileges of the
commons, the hou&s;e of lords would &s;ee their own dignity
endangered by every advance which the crown made
to independency upon the re&s;olutions of parliament.
The admi&s;&s;ion of arbitrary power is no le&s;s formidable
to the grandeur of the ari&s;tocracy, than it is fatal to the
liberty of the republic; that is, it would reduce the nobility
from the hereditary &s;hare they po&s;&s;e&s;s in the national coun|cils,
in which their real greatne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, to the making
them a part of the empty pageantry of a de&s;potic court. On
the other hand, if the hou&s;e of commons &s;hould intrench
upon the di&s;tinct province, or u&s;urp the e&s;tabli&s;hed prero|gative
of the crown, the hou&s;e of lords would receive an
in&s;tant alarm from every new &s;tretch of popular power.
In any conte&s;t in which the king may be engaged with
the repre&s;entative body, in defence of his e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hare
of authority, he will find a natural and &s;ure ally in the
collective power of the nobility. An attachment to the
monarchy, from which they derive their own di&s;tinction;
the allurements of a court, in the habits and with the
&s;entiments of which they have been brought up; their
hatred of equality, and of all levelling preten&s;ions, which
may ultimately affect the privileges, or even the exi&s;tence
of their order; in &s;hort, every principle and every preju|dice
which are wont to actuate human conduct, will de|termine
their choice, to the &s;ide and &s;upport of the crown.
<PB N="482" REF="522">
La&s;tly, if the nobles them&s;elves &s;hould attempt to revive
the &s;uperiorities, which their ance&s;tors exerci&s;ed under
the feudal con&s;titution, the king and the people would
alike remember, how the one had been in&s;ulted, and the
other en&s;laved, by that barbarous tyranny. They would
forget the natural oppo&s;ition of their views and inclinations,
when they &s;aw them&s;elves threatened with the return of
a domination, which was odious and intolerable to both.</P>
<P>The reader will have ob&s;erved, that in de&s;cribing the
Briti&s;h con&s;titution little notice has been taken of the hou&s;e of lords. The proper u&s;e and de&s;ign of this
part of the con&s;titution, are the following: Fir&s;t, to
enable the king, by his right of be&s;towing the peerage,
to reward the &s;ervants of the public, in a manner mo&s;t
grateful to them, and at a &s;mall expence to the nation;
&s;econdly, to fortify the power and &s;ecure the &s;tability of
regal government, by an order of men allied to its intetere&s;ts;
and, thirdly, for a purpo&s;e, which, though of
&s;uperior importance to the other two, does not occur &s;o
readily to our ob&s;ervation. Large bodies of men are &s;ub|ject
to &s;udden phrenzies. I mean, that opinions may be
circulated among&s;t a multitude without proof or exami|nation,
acquiring confidence and reputation merely by
being repeated from one to another; and that pa&s;&s;ions
founded upon the&s;e opinions, diffu&s;ing them&s;elves with a
rapidity that can neither be accounted for nor re&s;i&s;ted,
&s;ometimes agitate a country with the mo&s;t violent com|motions.
Now the only way to &s;top the &s;ermentation, is
<PB N="483" REF="523">
to divide the ma&s;s; that is, to erect different orders in the
community, with &s;eparate prejudices and intere&s;ts. And
this may, occa&s;ionally, become the u&s;e of an hereditary
nobility, inve&s;ted with a &s;hare of legi&s;lation, namely, to
&s;tem the progre&s;s of popular fury. Aver&s;e to tho&s;e preju|dices,
which actuate the minds of the vulgar; accu&s;tom|ed
to contemn the clamour of the populace; di&s;daining to
receive laws and opinions from their inferiors in rank,
they will oppo&s;e re&s;olutions, which are founded in the
folly and violence of the lower part of the community.
Was the voice of the people always dictated by reflection;
did eyery man, or even one man in an hundred think for
him&s;elf, or actually con&s;ider the mea&s;ure he was about to
approve or cen&s;ure; or even were the common people
tolerably &s;teadfa&s;t in the judgment which they formed, I
&s;hould hold the interference of a &s;uperior order, not only
&s;uperfluous, but bad: for, when every thing is allowed to
difference of rank and education, which the actual &s;tate of
the&s;e advantages de&s;erves, that, after all, is mo&s;t likely to
be right and expedient, which appears to be &s;o to the &s;e|parate
judgment and deci&s;ion of a great majority of the
nation; at lea&s;t, that, in general, is right <HI>for them,</HI> which
is agreeable to their fixed opinions and de&s;ires: But when
we ob&s;erve, what is urged as the public opinion, to be, in
truth, the opinion only, or perhaps the &s;eigned profe&s;&s;ions
of a few crafty, leaders; that the numbers, who join in the
cry, &s;erve only to &s;well and multiply the &s;ound, without
any acce&s;&s;ion of judgment, or exerci&s;e of under&s;tanding; and
that oftentimes the wi&s;e&s;t councils have been thus over|borne
<PB N="484" REF="524">
by tumult and uproar,&mdash;we may conceive occa&s;ions
to ari&s;e, in which the commonwealth may be &s;aved by
the reluctance of the nobility to yield to the vehemence,
or adopt the caprices of the common people. In expecting
this advantage from an order of nobles, we do not &s;uppo&s;e
the nobility to be more unprejudiced than others; but
that their prejudices will be different, and may occa&s;ion|ally
counteract tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>If the per&s;onal privileges of the peerage, which are
u&s;ually &s;o many injuries to the re&s;t of the community, be
re&s;trained, I &s;ee little inconvenience in the increa&s;e of its
number; for it is only dividing the &s;ame quantity of
power among&s;t more hands, which is rather favourable to
public freedom, than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The admi&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics into
the Hou&s;e of Lords, is but an equitable compen&s;ation to
the clergy for the exclu&s;ion of their order from the hou&s;e
of commons. They are a &s;et of men con&s;iderable by their
number and property, as well as by their influence, and
the duties of their &s;tation; yet, whil&s;t every other pro|fe&s;&s;ion has tho&s;e among&s;t the national repre&s;entatives,
who, being conver&s;ant in the &s;ame occupation, are able
to &s;tate, and naturally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport the rights and
intere&s;ts of the cla&s;s and calling to which they belong,
the clergy alone are deprived of this advantage. If the
Bi&s;hops, from gratitude or expectation, be more ob&s;e|quious
to the will of the crown, than tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s
<PB N="485" REF="525">
great temporal inheritances, they are properly in&s;erted
into that part of the con&s;titution, from which much or
frequent re&s;i&s;tance to the mea&s;ures of government is not
expected.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that I perceive no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for
exempting the per&s;ons of members of either hou&s;e of par|liament
from arre&s;t for debt. The councils or &s;uffrage of
a &s;ingle &s;enator, e&s;pecially of one who in the manage|ment
of his own affairs may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected of a want
of prudence or hone&s;ty, can &s;eldom be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e
of the public, as to ju&s;tify a departure from that whole|&s;ome
policy, by which the laws of a commercial &s;tate
puni&s;h and &s;tigmatize in&s;olvency. The pro&s;pect of di&s;|grace
might make &s;uch men more provident. But what|ever
rea&s;on may be pleaded for their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> immunity,
when this privilege of parliament is extended to dome&s;tics
and retainers, or when it is permitted to impede or delay
the cour&s;e of judicial proceedings, it becomes an ab&s;urd
&s;acrifice of equal ju&s;tice to imaginary dignity.</P>
<P>There is nothing, in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, &s;o re|markable,
as the irregularity of the popular repre&s;entation.
The hou&s;e of commons con&s;i&s;ts of five hundred and forty
eight members, of whom, two hundred are elected by &s;even
thou&s;and con&s;tituents: &s;o that a majority of the&s;e &s;even
thou&s;and, without any rea&s;onable title to &s;uperior weight
and influence in the &s;tate, may, under certain circum|&s;tances,
decide a que&s;tion again&s;t the opinion of as many
<PB N="486" REF="526">
millions. Or, to place the &s;ame object in another point of
view; if my e&s;tate be &s;ituated in one county of the king|dom,
I po&s;&s;e&s;s the ten thou&s;andth part of a &s;ingle repre&s;en|tative;
if in another, the thou&s;andth; if in a particular
district, I may be one in twenty who choo&s;e two repre&s;en|tatives;
if in a &s;till more favoured &s;pot, I may enjoy the right
of appointing two my&s;elf. If I have been born, or dwell,
or have &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in one town, I am, repre|&s;ented
in the national a&s;&s;embly by two deputies, in the
choice of whom, I exerci&s;e an actual and &s;en&s;ible &s;hare of
power; if accident has thrown my birth, or habitation, or
&s;ervice into another town, I have no repre&s;entative at all,
nor any more power or concern in he election of tho&s;e
who make the laws, by which I am governed, than if I
was a &s;ubject of the Grand Seignior&mdash;and this partiality
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts without any pretence whatever of merit or public
propriety, to ju&s;tify, the preference of one place to another.
Or, thirdly, to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of national repre&s;entation
as it exi&s;ts in reality; it may be affirmed, I believe, with
truth, that about one half of the hou&s;e of commons ob|tain
their &s;eats in that a&s;&s;embly by the election of the
people, the other half by purcha&s;e, or the nomination of
&s;ingle proprietors of great e&s;tates.</P>
<P>This is a flagrant incongruity in the con&s;titution; but
is is one of tho&s;e objections which &s;trike mo&s;t forcibly at
fir&s;t fight. The effect of all rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject
is to dimini&s;h the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion: on which account it
de&s;erves the more attentive examination, that we may be
<PB N="487" REF="527">
a&s;&s;ured, before we adventure upon a reformation, that the
magnitude of the evil ju&s;tifies the danger of the experiment.
In the few remarks that follow, we would be under&s;tood,
in the fir&s;t place, to decline all conference with tho&s;e
who wi&s;h to alter the form of government of the&s;e king|doms.
The reformers with whom we have to do, are
they, who, whil&s;t they change this part of the &s;y&s;tem,
would retain the re&s;t. If any Englishman expect more
happine&s;s to his country under a republic, he may very
con&s;i&s;tently recommend a new modelling of elections to
parliament; becau&s;e, if the king and hou&s;e of lords were
laid a&s;ide, the pre&s;ent di&s;proportionate repre&s;entation
would produce nothing but a confu&s;ed and ill-dige&s;ted oli|garchy.
In like manner we wave a controver&s;y, with
tho&s;e writers who in&s;i&s;t upon repre&s;entation as a <HI>natural</HI>
right<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">If this right be <HI>natural,</HI> no doubt it mu&s;t be equal, and the right, we may add, of one &s;ex, as well as of the other. Whereas every plan of repre&s;entation, that we have heard of, begins, by excluding the votes of women: thus cutting off, at a &s;ingle &s;troke, one half of the public from a right which is a&s;&s;erted to be inherent in all; a right too, as they repre&s;ent it, not only univer&s;al, but unalienable and inde&s;ea&s;able.</NOTE>: we con&s;ider it &s;o far only as a right at all, as it
conduces to public utility; that is, as it contributes to the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of good laws, or &s;ecures to the people the
ju&s;t administration of the&s;e laws. The&s;e effects depend
upon the political conduct, and that conduct upon the
di&s;po&s;ition and abilities of the national coun&s;ellors. Where|fore,
if men the mo&s;t likely by their qualifications to
know and to promote the public intere&s;t, be actually re|turned
<PB N="488" REF="528">
to parliament, it &s;ignifies little who return them.
If the propere&s;t per&s;ons be elected, what matters it by
whom they are elected? At lea&s;t, no prudent &s;tate&s;man
would &s;ubvert long e&s;tabli&s;hed or even &s;ettled rules of re|pre&s;entation,
without a pro&s;pect of procuring wi&s;er or
better repre&s;entatives. This then being well ob&s;erved,
let us, before we &s;eek to obtain any thing more, con&s;ider
duely what we already have. We <HI>have</HI> a Hou&s;e of Com|mons
compo&s;ed of five hundred and forty-eight members,
in which number are found, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable land|holders
and merchants of the kingdom; the heads of the
army, the navy, and the law; the occupiers of great
offices in the &s;tate; together with many private individu|als,
eminent by their knowledge, eloquence, or activity.
Now, if the country be not &s;afe in &s;uch hands, in who&s;e
may it con&s;ide its intere&s;ts? If &s;uch a number of &s;uch
men be liable to the influence of corrupt motives, what
a&s;&s;embly of men will be &s;ecure from the &s;ame danger?
Does any new &s;cheme of repre&s;entation promi&s;e to collect
together more wi&s;dom, or produce firmer integrity? In
this view of the &s;ubject, and attending not to ideas of ab|&s;tract
proportion and regularity, (of which many minds are
much enamoured,) but to effects alone, we may di&s;cover
ju&s;t excu&s;es for tho&s;e parts of the pre&s;ent repre&s;entation,
which appear to a ha&s;ty ob&s;erver mo&s;t exceptionable and
ab&s;urd. It &s;hould be remembered as a maxim extremely
applicable to this &s;ubject, that no order or a&s;&s;embly of
men whatever can long maintain their place and authority
in a mixed government, of which, the members do not
<PB N="489" REF="529">
individually po&s;&s;e&s;s a re&s;pectable &s;hare of per&s;onal import|ance.
Now, whatever may be the defects of the pre&s;ent
arrangement, it infallibly &s;ecures a great weight of pro|perty
to the hou&s;e of commons, by rendering many &s;eats
in that hou&s;e acce&s;&s;ible to men of large fortunes, and to
tho&s;e alone&mdash;by which means &s;uch men are engaged in
the defence of the &s;eparate rights and intere&s;ts of this
branch of the legi&s;lature as are be&s;t able to &s;upport its
claims. The con&s;titution of mo&s;t of the &s;mall boroughs,
e&s;pecially the burgage tenure, though not formed with
this de&s;ign, contributes to the &s;ame effect; for the appoint|ment
of the repre&s;entatives we find commonly annexed to
certain great inheritances. Elections purely popular are
in this re&s;pect uncertain: in times of tranquillity, the na|tural
a&s;cendency of wealth will prevail; but when the
minds of men are inflamed by political di&s;&s;entions, this in|fluence
often yields to more impetuous motives. The
variety of tenures and qualifications, upon which the
right of voting is founded, appears to me a recommendation
of the mode which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, as it tends to introduce
into parliament a corre&s;ponding mixture of characters and
profe&s;&s;ions. It has been long ob&s;erved that con&s;picuous
abilities are mo&s;t frequently &s;ound with the repre&s;entatives
of &s;mall boroughs. And this is nothing more than what
the laws of human conduct might teach us to expect:
when &s;uch boroughs are &s;et to &s;ale, tho&s;e men are likely
to become purcha&s;ers, who are enabled by their talents to
make the be&s;t of their bargain: when a &s;eat is not &s;old, but
given by the opulent proprietor of a burgage tenure, the
<PB N="490" REF="530">
patron finds his own intere&s;t con&s;ulted, by the repu|tation
and abilities of the member, whom he nominates.
If certain of the nobility hold the appointment of &s;ome
part of the hou&s;e of commons, it &s;erves to maintain that
alliance between the two branches of the legi&s;lature, which
no good citizen would wi&s;h to &s;ee di&s;&s;evered: it helps
to keep the government of the country in the hou&s;e
of commons, in which, it would not perhaps long con|tinue
to re&s;ide, if &s;o powerful and wealthy a part of the na|tion
as the peerage compo&s;e, were excluded from all &s;hare
and intere&s;t in its con&s;titution. If there be a few boroughs
&s;o circum&s;tanced as to lie at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown,
whil&s;t the number of &s;uch is known and &s;mall, they may
be tolerated with little danger. For where would be the
impropriety, or the inconvenience, if the King at once
&s;hould nominate a limited number of his &s;ervants to &s;eats
in parliament; or, what is the &s;ame thing, if &s;eats in
parliament were annexed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain of
the mo&s;t efficient and re&s;pon&s;ible offices in the &s;tate?
The pre&s;ent repre&s;entation, after all the&s;e deductions, and
under the confu&s;ion in which it confe&s;&s;edly lies, is &s;till in
&s;uch a degree popular; or rather the repre&s;entatives are
&s;o connected with the ma&s;s of the community, by a
&s;ociety of intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, that the will of the people,
when it is determined, permanent, and general, almo&s;t
always at length prevails.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, in the &s;everal plans which have
been &s;ugge&s;ted, of an equal or a reformed repre&s;enta|tion,
it will be difficult to di&s;cover any propo&s;al that
has a tendency to throw more of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
<PB N="491" REF="531">
nation into the hou&s;e of commons, or to collect a &s;et
of men more fit to tran&s;act that bu&s;ine&s;s, or in general
more intere&s;ted in the national happine&s;s and pro&s;perity.
One con&s;equence, however, may be expected from the&s;e
projects, namely, &startq;le&s;s flexibility to the influence of the
crown.&endq; And &s;ince the diminution of this influence, is the
declared, and perhaps the &s;ole de&s;ign of the various &s;chemes
that have been produced, whether for regulating the elec|tions,
contracting the duration, or for purifying the con|&s;titution
of parliament by the exclu&s;ion of placemen and
pen&s;ioners; it is obvious and of importance to remark,
that the more apt and natural, as well as the more &s;afe and
quiet way of attaining the &s;ame end, would be, by a direct
reduction of the patronage of the crown, which might be
effected to a certain extent without hazarding farther con|&s;equeuces.
Superfluous and exorbitant emoluments may
not only be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for the pre&s;ent; but provi&s;ions of
law be devi&s;ed, which &s;ould for the future re&s;train with|in
certain limits, the number and value of the offices in
the donation of the king.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t we di&s;pute concerning different &s;chemes of
reformation, all directed to the &s;ame end, a previous doubt
occurs in the debate, whether the end it&s;elf be good, or
even innocent&mdash;whether the influence &s;o loudly com|plained
of can be de&s;troyed, or even dimini&s;hed, with
&s;afety to the &s;tate. Whil&s;t the zeal of &s;ome men beholds
this influence with a jealou&s;y, which nothing but its abo|lition
can appea&s;e, many wife and virtuous politicians
<PB N="492" REF="532">
deem a con&s;iderable portion of it to be as nece&s;&s;ary a part of
the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, as any other ingredient in the com|po&s;ition&mdash;to
be that, indeed, which gives cohe&s;ion and
&s;olidity to the whole. Were the mea&s;ures of government,
&s;ay they, oppo&s;ed from nothing but principle, government
ought to have nothing but the rectitude of its mea&s;ures to
&s;upport them; but &s;ince oppo&s;ition &s;prings from other
motives, government mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s an influence to coun|teract
that oppo&s;ition&mdash;to produce, not a bias of the pa&s;|&s;ions,
but a neutrality: it mu&s;t have &s;ome weight to ca&s;t
into the &s;cale to &s;et the balance even. It is the nature
of power always to pre&s;s upon the boundaries which
confine it. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, faction, envy, impatience of
control or inferiority; the &s;ecret plea&s;ure of mortifying
the great, or the hopes of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them; a con&s;tant
willingne&s;s to que&s;tion and thwart whatever is dictated or
even propo&s;ed by another; a di&s;po&s;ition common to all
bodies of men to extend the claims and authority of their
order; above all, that love of power, and of &s;howing it,
which re&s;ides more or le&s;s in every human brea&s;t, and
which, in popular a&s;&s;emblies, is inflamed, like every other
pa&s;&s;ion, by communication and encouragement: the&s;e
motives, added to private de&s;igns and re&s;entments, che|ri&s;hed
al&s;o by popular acclamation, and operating upon
the great &s;hare of power already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of
commons, might induce a majority, or at lea&s;t a large
party of men in that a&s;&s;embly, to unite in endeavouring
to draw to them&s;elves the whole government of the &s;tate;
or at lea&s;t &s;o to ob&s;truct the conduct of public affairs, by a
<PB N="493" REF="533">
wanton and perver&s;e oppo&s;ition, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible
for the wi&s;e&s;t &s;tate&s;man to carry forwards the bu&s;ine&s;s of
the nation in parliament, with &s;ucce&s;s or &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Some pa&s;&s;ages of our national hi&s;tory afford grounds for
the&s;e apprehen&s;ions. Before the acce&s;&s;ion of James the
Fir&s;t, or, at lea&s;t, during the reigns of his three immedi|ate
predece&s;&s;ors, the government of England was a go|vernment
by force; that is, the king carried his mea&s;ures
in parliament by <HI>intimidation.</HI> A &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal dan|ger
kept the members of the hou&s;e of commons in &s;ub|jection.
A conjunction of fortunate cau&s;es delivered at
la&s;t the parliament and nation from &s;lavery. That over|bearing
&s;y&s;tem, which had declined in the hands of James,
expired early in the reign of his &s;on. After the re&s;toration
there &s;ucceeded in its place, and &s;ince the revolution has been methodically pur&s;ued, the more &s;ucce&s;sful expedient
of influence. Now we remember what pa&s;&s;ed between
the lo&s;s of terror, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of influence.
The tran&s;actions of that interval, whatever we may think
of their occa&s;ion or effect, no friend of regal government
would wi&s;h to &s;ee revived.&mdash;But the affairs of this king|dom
afford a more recent atte&s;tation to the &s;ame doctrine.
In the Briti&s;h colonies of North America, the late a&s;&s;em|blies
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much of the power and con&s;titution of our
hou&s;e of commons. The king and government of Great
Britain held no patronage in the country, which could
create attachment and influence, &s;ufficient to counteract
that re&s;tle&s;s, arrogating &s;pirit, which in popular a&s;&s;emblies,
<PB N="494" REF="534">
when left to it&s;elf, will never brook an authority, that
checks and interferes with its own. To this cau&s;e, exci|ted
perhaps by &s;ome un&s;ea&s;onable provocations, we may
attribute, as to their true and proper original, we will not
&s;ay the misfortunes, but the changes that have taken
place in the Briti&s;h empire. The admonition, which
&s;uch examples &s;ugge&s;t, will have its weight with tho&s;e,
who are content with the general frame of the Engli&s;h
con&s;titution; and who con&s;ider &s;tability among&s;t the fir&s;t
perfections of any government.</P>
<P>We prote&s;t however again&s;t any con&s;truction, by
which what is here &s;aid &s;hall be attempted to be applied
to the ju&s;tification of bribery, or of any clandestine reward or &s;olicitation whatever. The very &s;ecrecy of &s;uch nego|tiations
confe&s;&s;es or begets a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt; which,
when the mind is once taught to endure without unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
the character is prepared for every compliance. And
there is the greater danger in the&s;e corrupt practices, as
the extent of their operation is unlimited and unknown.
Our apology relates &s;olely to that influence, which re&s;ults
from the acceptance or expectation of public pre&s;erments.
Nor does the influence, which we defend, require any &s;a|crifice
of per&s;onal probity. In political, above all other
&s;ubjects, the arguments, or rather the conjectures on each
&s;ide of a que&s;tion, are often &s;o equally poized, that the
wi&s;e&s;t judgments may be held in &s;u&s;pence. The&s;e I call
&s;ubjects of <HI>indifference.</HI> But again, when the &s;ubject is not
<HI>indifferent</HI> in it&s;elf, it will appear &s;uch to a great part of
tho&s;e to whom it is propo&s;ed, for want of information, or
<PB N="495" REF="535">
reflection, or experience, or capacity to collect and weigh
the rea&s;ons by which either &s;ide is &s;upported. The&s;e are
&s;ubjects of <HI>apparent indifference.</HI> This indifference occurs
&s;till more frequently in per&s;onal conte&s;ts; in which, we
do not often di&s;cover any rea&s;on of public utility, for the
preference of one competitor to another. The&s;e ca&s;es
compo&s;e the province of influence; that is, the deci&s;ion
in the&s;e ca&s;es will inevitably be determined by influence
of &s;ome &s;ort or other. The only que&s;tion is, what in|fluence
&s;hall be admitted. If you remove the influence of
the crown, it is only to make way for influence from a
different quarter. If motives of expectation and gratitude
be withdrawn, other motives will &s;ucceed in their place,
acting probably in an oppo&s;ite direction, but equally irre|lative
and external to the proper merits of the que&s;tion.
There exi&s;t, as we have &s;een, pa&s;&s;ions in the human heart,
which will always make a &s;trong party again&s;t the execu|tive
power of a mixed government. According as the
di&s;po&s;ition of parliament is friendly or adver&s;e to the re|commendation
of the crown in matters which are really
or apparently indifferent, as indifference hath been now
explained, the bu&s;ine&s;s of empire will be tran&s;acted with
ea&s;e and convenience, or embarra&s;&s;ed with endle&s;s conten|tion
and difficulties. Nor is it a conclu&s;ion founded in
ju&s;tice or experience, that, becau&s;e men are induced by
views of intere&s;t to yield their con&s;ent or &s;upport to mea|&s;ures,
concerning which their judgment decides nothing,
they may be brought by the &s;ame influence, to act in de|liberate
oppo&s;ition to knowledge and duty. Whoever re|views
the operations of government in this country &s;ince
<PB N="496" REF="536">
the revolution, will find few even of the mo&s;t que&s;tionable
mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, about which the be&s;t in&s;truc|ted
judgment might not have doubted at the time; but of
which he may affirm with certainty, that they were
<HI>indifferent</HI> to the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who concurred in
them. From the &s;ucce&s;s or the facility, with which they
who dealt out the patronage of the crown carried mea&s;ures
like the&s;e, ought we $word$ conclude, that a &s;imilar application
of honours and emoluments would procure the con&s;ent
of parliament to councils evidently detrimental to the
common welfare? Is there not, on the contrary, more
rea&s;on to fear, that the prerogative, if deprived of influ|ence,
would not be long able to &s;upport it&s;elf? For when
we reflect upon the power of the hou&s;e of commons to
extort a compliance with its re&s;olutions from the other
parts of the legi&s;lature; or to put to death the con&s;titution
by a refu&s;al of the annual grants of money, to the &s;upport
of the nece&s;&s;ary functions of government&mdash;when we re|flect
al&s;o, what motives there are, which, in the vici&s;&s;itudes
of political intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, may one day arm and
point this power again&s;t the executive magi&s;trate&mdash;when
we attend to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we &s;hall be led perhaps
to acknowledge, that there is not more of paradox than of
probability, in that important, but much decried apo|thegm,
&startq;that an independent parliament is incompatible
with the exi&s;tence of the monarchy.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t maxim of a free &s;tate is, that the laws be
made by one &s;et of men, and admini&s;tered by ano|ther;
in other words, that the legi&s;lative and judicial cha|racters
be kept &s;eparate. When the&s;e offices are united
in the &s;ame per&s;on or a&s;&s;embly, particular laws are made
for particular ca&s;es, &s;pringing oftentimes from partial mo|tives,
and directed to private ends: whil&s;t they are kept
&s;eparate, general laws are made by one body of men,
without fore&s;eeing whom they may affect; and when
made, mu&s;t be applied by the other, let them affect whom
they will.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of illu&s;tration let it be &s;uppo&s;ed in this
country, either that, parliaments being laid a&s;ide, the courts
of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall made their own law; or that the
two hou&s;es, of parliament, with the King at their head,
tried and decided, cau&s;es their bar: it is evident, in the
fir&s;t place, that the deci&s;ions of &s;uch a judicature would be
&s;o many laws; and, in the &s;econd place, that, when the
parties and the intere&s;ts to be affected by the law were
<PB N="498" REF="538">
known, the inclinations of the law makers would inevitably
attach on one &s;ide or the other; and that, where there was neither any fixed rules to regulate their determinations,
nor any &s;uperior power to control their proceedings,, the&s;e
inclinations would interfere with the integrity of public
ju&s;tice. The con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be, that the
&s;ubjects of &s;uch a con&s;titution would live either without
any con&s;tant laws, that is, without any known pre|e&s;tabli&s;hed
rules of adjudication whatever; or under laws
made for particular ca&s;es and particular per&s;ons, and par|taking
of the contradictions and iniquity of the motives,
to which they owed their origin.</P>
<P>Which dangers, by the divi&s;ion of the legi&s;lative and
judicial functions, are effectually provided again&s;t. Par|liament
knows not the individuals upon whom its acts will
operate; it has no ca&s;es or parties before it; no private
de&s;igns to &s;erve: con&s;equently, its re&s;olutions will be &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by the con&s;ideration of univer&s;al effects and tenden|cies,
which always produces impartial, and commonly ad|vantageous
regulations. When laws are made, courts of
ju&s;tice, whatever be the di&s;po&s;ition of the judges, mu&s;t
abide by them; for the legi&s;lative being nece&s;&s;arily the
&s;upreme power of the &s;tate, the judicial and every other
power is accountable to that: and it cannot be doubted,
but that the per&s;ons, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;overeign authority
of government, will be tenacious of the laws which they
them&s;elves pre&s;cribe, and &s;ufficiently jealous of the a&s;&s;umption
<PB N="499" REF="539">
&s;umption of di&s;pen&s;ing and legi&s;lative powers by any others.</P>
<P>This fundamental rule of civil jurisprudence is viola|ted
in
the ca&s;e of acts of attainder, of confi&s;cation, in bills
of pains and penalties, and in all <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> laws what|ever,
in which parliament exerci&s;es the double office of
legi&s;lature and judge. And whoever, either under&s;tands
the value of the <HI>rule</HI> it&s;elf, or collects the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e
in&s;tances, in which it has been invaded, will be induced,
I believe, to acknowledge, that it had been wi&s;er and &s;afer
never to have departed from it. He will confe&s;s at lea&s;t,
that nothing but the mo&s;t manife&s;t and immediate peril of
the commonwealth will ju&s;tify a repetition of the&s;e dan|gerous
examples. If the laws in being do not puni&s;h an
offender, let him go unpuni&s;hed; let the legi&s;lature, ad|moni&s;hed
of the defect of the laws, provide again&s;t the
commi&s;&s;ion of future crimes of the &s;ame fort. The e&s;cape
of one delinquent can never produce &s;o much harm to the
community, as may ari&s;e from the infraction of a rule,
upon which the purity of public ju&s;tice, and the exi&s;tence
of civil liberty e&s;&s;entially depend.</P>
<P>The next &s;ecurity for the impartial admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice, especially in deci&s;ions to which government is a
party, is the independency of the judges. As redre&s;s and
protection again&s;t every illegal attack upon the rights of
the &s;ubject by the &s;ervants of the crown are to be &s;ought
for from the&s;e tribunals, the judges of the land become
<PB N="500" REF="540">
the arbitrators between the king and the people. On which
account they ought to be independent of either; or, what
is the &s;ame thing, equally dependent upon both; that is,
if they be appointed by the one, they &s;hould be remove|able
only by the other. This was the policy, which dic|tated
that memorable improvement in our con&s;titution,
by which the judges, who, before the revolution, held
their offices during the plea&s;ure of the king, can now only
be deprived of them by an addre&s;s from both hou&s;es of
parliament; as the mo&s;t regular, &s;olemn, and authentic
way, by which the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the people can be ex|pre&s;&s;ed.
To make this independency of the judges com|plete,
the public &s;alaries of their office ought not only
to be certain both in amount and continuance, but &s;o
liberal as to &s;ecure their integrity from the temptation of
&s;ecret bribes: which liberality will an&s;wer al&s;o the farther
purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving their juri&s;diction from contempt, and
their characters from &s;u&s;picion; as well as of rendering
the &s;tation worthy of the ambition of men of eminence
in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A third precaution to be ob&s;erved in the forming of
courts of ju&s;tice, is, that the numbers of the judges be
&s;mall. For, be&s;ide that the violence and tumult in&s;epara|ble
from large a&s;&s;emblies arc incon&s;i&s;tent with the pa|tience,
method, and attention requi&s;ite in judicial inve&s;ti|gations;
be&s;ide that all pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices act with
augmented force upon a collected multitude; be&s;ide the&s;e
objections, judges when they are numerous divide the
<PB N="501" REF="541">
&s;hame of an unju&s;t determination, they &s;helter them&s;elves
under one another's example; each man thinks his
own character hid in the croud: for which rea&s;on the
judges ought always to be &s;o few, that the conduct of each
may be con&s;picuous to public ob&s;ervation; that each may
be re&s;pon&s;ible in his &s;eparate and particular reputation for
the deci&s;ions in which he concurs. The truth of the re|mark
has been exemplified in this country, in the effects
of that wife regulation, which transferred the trial of
parliamentary elections from the hou&s;e of commons at
large, to a &s;elect committee of that hou&s;e compo&s;ed of
thirteen members. This alteration, &s;imply by reducing
the number of the judges, and, in con&s;equence of that
reduction, expo&s;ing the judicial conduct of each to public
animadver&s;ion, has given to a judicature, which had been
long &s;wayed by intere&s;t and &s;olicitation, the &s;olemnity
and virtue of the mo&s;t, upright tribunals. I &s;hould prefer
an even to an odd number of judges, and four to almo&s;t
any other number; for in this number, be&s;ide that it &s;uf|ficiently
con&s;ults the idea of &s;eparate re&s;pon&s;ibility, nothing
can be decided but by a majority of three to one. And
when we con&s;ider that every deci&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hes a perpe|tual
precedent, we &s;hall allow that it ought to proceed
from an authority not le&s;s than this. If the court be
equally divided nothing is done; things remain as they
were; with &s;ome inconveniency, indeed, to the parties,
but without the danger to the public, of a, ha&s;ty precedent.</P>
<P>A fourth requi&s;ite in the con&s;titution of a court of ju&s;|tice,
and equivalent to many checks upon the di&s;cretion
<PB N="502" REF="542">
of judges, is that its proceedings be carried on in public;
<HI>apertis &s;oribus;</HI> not only before a promi&s;cuous concour&s;e of
by-&s;tanders, but in the audience of the whole profe&s;&s;ion
of the law. The opinion of the Bar concerning what
pa&s;&s;es will be impartial; and will guide that of the pub|lic.
The mo&s;t corrupt judge will fear to indulge his dif|hone&s;t
wi&s;hes in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly: he
mu&s;t encounter what few can &s;upport, the cen&s;ure of his
equals and companions, together with the indignation
and reproaches of his country.</P>
<P>Something is al&s;o gained to the public by appointing
two or three courts of concurrent juri&s;diction, that it may
remain in the option of the &s;uitor to which he will re&s;ort.
By this means a tribunal which may happen to be occu|pied
by ignorant or &s;u&s;pected judges, will be de&s;erted for
others, that po&s;&s;e&s;s more of the confidence of the nation.</P>
<P>But, la&s;tly, if &s;everal courts, co-ordinate to, and inde|pendent
of each other, &s;ub&s;i&s;t together in the country, it
&s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that the appeals from all of them &s;hould
meet and terminate in the &s;ame judicature; in order that
one &s;upreme tribunal, by who&s;e final &s;entence all others
are bound and concluded, may &s;uperintend and pre&s;ide
over the re&s;t. This con&s;titution is nece&s;&s;ary for two pur|po&s;es&mdash;to
pre&s;erve an uniformity in the deci&s;ions of infe|rior
courts, and to maintain to each the proper limits of
its juri&s;diction. Without a common &s;uperior, different
courts might e&s;tabli&s;h contradictory rules of adjudication,
<PB N="503" REF="543">
and the contradiction be final and without remedy: the
&s;ame que&s;tion might receive opposite determinations, ac|cording
as it was brought before one court or another, and
the determination in each be ultimate and irrever&s;ible. A
common appellant juri&s;diction prevents or puts an end to
this confu&s;ion. For when the judgments upon appeals are
con&s;i&s;tent, which may be expected, whil&s;t the &s;ame court
is at la&s;t re&s;orted to, the different courts, from which the
appeals lie, will be reduced to a like con&s;i&s;tency with one
another. Moreover, if que&s;tions ari&s;e between courts
independent of each, other, concerning the extent and
boundaries of their re&s;pective juri&s;diction, aa each will be
de&s;irous of enlarging its own, an authority which, both
acknowledge can alone adju&s;t the controver&s;y. Such a
power, therefore, mu&s;t re&s;ide &s;omewhere, le&s;t the rights
and repo&s;e of the country be di&s;tracted, by the endle&s;s op|po&s;ition
and mutual encroachment of its courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of Judicature; the one, where the
office of the judge is permanent in the fame per&s;on, and
con&s;equently where the judge is appointed and known
long before the trial; the other, where the judge is deter|mined
by lot at the time of the trial, and for that turn
only. The one may be called a <HI>fixed,</HI> the other a <HI>ca&s;ual</HI>
judicature. From the former may be expected tho&s;e
qualifications, which are preferred and &s;ought for in the
choice of the judges, and that knowledge and readi|ne&s;s
which re&s;ult from experience in the office. But
then, as the judge is known beforehand, he is acce&s;&s;ible
<PB N="504" REF="544">
to the parties; there exi&s;ts a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecret manage|ment
and undue practices: or, in conte&s;ts between the
crown and the &s;ubject, the judge appointed by the crown
may be &s;u&s;pected of partiality to his patron; or of enter|taining
inclinations favourable to the authority, from
which he derives his own. The advantage attending the
&s;econd kind of judicature is indifferency; the defect, the
want of that legal &s;cience, which produces uniformity and
ju&s;tice in legal deci&s;ions. The con&s;truction of Engli&s;h
courts of law, in which cau&s;es are tried, by a jury with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a judge, combines the two &s;pecies toge|ther
with peculiar &s;ucce&s;s. This admirable contrivance
unites the wi&s;dom of a fixed with the integrity of a ca&s;ual
judicature, and avoids, in a great mea&s;ure, the inconve|niences
of both. The judge imparts to the jury the bene|fit
of his erudition and experience; the jury, by their
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, check any corrupt partialities which
previous application may have produced in the judge.
If the determination was left to the judge, the party
might &s;uffer under the &s;uperior intere&s;t of his adver&s;ary:
if it was left to an unin&s;tructed jury, his rights would be
in &s;till greater danger, from the ignorance-of tho&s;e who
were to decide upon them. The pre&s;ent wife admixture
of chance and choice in the con&s;titution of the court, in
which his cau&s;e is tried, guards him equally again&s;t the
fear of injury from either of the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In proportion to the acknowledged excellency of this
mode of trial, every deviation from it ought to be watched
<PB N="505" REF="545">
with vigilance, and adopted by the legi&s;lature with cau|tion.
Summary convictions before ju&s;tices of the peace,
e&s;pecially for offences again&s;t the game laws; courts of
con&s;cience; extending the juri&s;diction of courts of equity;
urging too far the di&s;tinction between que&s;tions of law
and matters of fact, are all &s;o many infringements upon
this great charter of public &s;afety.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the trial by jury is &s;ometimes found ina|dequate
to the admini&s;tration of equal ju&s;tice. This im|perfection
takes place chie&s;ly in ca&s;es, in which &s;ome po|pular
pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice intervenes; as where a particular
order of men advance claims upon the re&s;t of the commu|nity,
which is the ca&s;e of the clergy contending for
tythes; or are obnoxious by their profe&s;&s;ion, as are officers
of the revenue, bailiffs, bailiffs followers, and other low
mini&s;ters of the law; or, where one of the parties has an
intere&s;t in common with the general intere&s;t of the jurors,
and that of the other is oppo&s;ed to it, as in conte&s;ts be|tween
landlords and tenants, between lords of manors and the
holders of e&s;tates under them; or, la&s;tly, where the minds
of men are in&s;lamed by political di&s;&s;en&s;ious or religious
hatred. The&s;e prejudices act mo&s;t powerfully upon the
common people, of which order juries are made up. The
force and danger of them are al&s;o increa&s;ed by the very
circum&s;tance of taking juries but of the county in
which the &s;ubject of di&s;pute ari&s;es. In the neighbourhood
of the parties the cau&s;e is often prejudged: and. the&s;e
&s;ecret deci&s;ions of the mind, proceed commonly more upon
<PB N="506" REF="546">
&s;entiments of favour or hatred; upon &s;ome opinion con|cerning
the &s;ect, family, profe&s;&s;ion, character, connections,
or circum&s;tances of the parties, than upon any know|ledge
or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the proper merits of the que&s;tion.
More exact ju&s;tice would, in many in&s;tances, be rendered to
the &s;uitors, if the determination were left entirely to the
judges; provided we could depend upon the &s;ame purity
of conduct when the power of the&s;e magi&s;trates was en|larged,
which they have long manife&s;ted in the exerci&s;e
of a mixed and re&s;trained authority. But this is an expe|riment
too big with public danger to be hazarded. The
effects, however, of &s;ome local prejudices might be &s;afely
obviated, by a law empowering the court, in which the
action is brought, to &s;end the cau&s;e to trial in a di&s;tant
county: the expences attending the change of place al|ways
falling upon the party who applied for it.</P>
<P>There is a &s;econd divi&s;ion of courts of ju&s;tice, which
pre&s;ents a new alternative of difficulties. Either one, two,
or a few &s;overeign courts may be erected in the metropolis,
for the whole kingdom to re&s;ort to; or numerous courts of
local juri&s;diction may be fixed in the various provinces and
di&s;tricts of the empire. Great, though oppo&s;ite incon|veniences
attend each arrangement. If the court be remote
and &s;olemn, it becomes, by the&s;e very qualities, ex|pen&s;ive
and dilatory: the expence is unavoidably increa&s;ed
when witne&s;&s;es, parties, and agents mu&s;t, be brought to
attend from di&s;tant parts of the Country: and, where the
whole judicial bu&s;ine&s;s of a large nation is collected into a
<PB N="507" REF="547">
few &s;uperior tribunals, it will be &s;ound impo&s;&s;ible, even
if the prolixity of forms which retards the progre&s;s of
cau&s;es were removed, <HI>to</HI> give a prompt hearing to every
complaint, or an immediate an&s;wer to any. On the
other hand, if to remedy the&s;e evils, and to render the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice cheap and &s;peedy, dome&s;tic and
&s;ummary tribunals be erected in each neighbourhood, the
advantage of &s;uch courts will be accompanied with all the
dangers of ignorance and partiality, and the certain mi&s;|chief
of confu&s;ion and contrariety in their deci&s;ions. The
law of England, by its circuit or itinerary courts, contains
a provi&s;ion for the di&s;tribution of private ju&s;tice in a great
mea&s;ure relieved from both the&s;e objections. As the pre|&s;iding
magi&s;trate comes into the country a &s;tranger to its
prejudices, rival&s;hips, and connections, he brings with
him none of tho&s;e attachments and regards;, which are &s;o
apt to pervert the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, when the parties and
the judges inhabit the &s;ame neighbourhood. Again, as
this magi&s;trate is u&s;ually one of the judges of the &s;upreme
tribunals of the kingdom, and has pa&s;t his life in the
&s;tudy and adminit&s;ration of the laws of his country, he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it may be pre&s;umed, tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ional qualifica|tions,
which befit the dignity and importance of his
&s;tation. La&s;tly, as both he, and the advocates who ac|company
him in his circuit, are employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s
of tho&s;e &s;uperior courts, (to which al&s;o their proceedings
are amenable,) they will naturally conduct them&s;elves by
the rules of adjudication, which they have applied, or
learnt there; and, by this means maintain, what con&s;ti|tutes
<PB N="508" REF="548">
a principal perfection of civil government, one law
of the land in every part and di&s;trict of the empire.</P>
<P>Next to the con&s;titution of courts of ju&s;tice, we may
confider the maxims which ought to guide their proceed|ings:
and upon this &s;ubject, the chief enquiry will be,
how far, and for what rea&s;ons, it is expedient to adhere to
former determinations; or, whether it be nece&s;&s;ary for judges,
to attend to any other con&s;ideration than the apparent and
particular equity of the ca&s;e before them. Now although
to a&s;&s;ert, that precedents e&s;tabli&s;hed by one &s;et of judges,
ought to be incontrovertible by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the
&s;ame juri&s;diction, or by tho&s;e who exerci&s;e a higher,
would be to attribute to the &s;entence of tho&s;e judges,
all the authority we a&s;cribe to the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of
the legi&s;lature: yet, the general &s;ecurity of private rights,
and of civil life, requires, that &s;uch precedents, e&s;pecially
if they have been confirmed by repeated adjudications,
&s;hould not be overthrown without a detection of manife&s;t
error, or &s;ome imputation of di&s;hone&s;ty upon the court by
who&s;e judgment the que&s;tion was fir&s;t decided. And
this deference to prior deci&s;ions is founded upon two rea|&s;ons;
fir&s;t, that the di&s;cretion of judges may be bound
down by po&s;itive rules; and, &s;econdly, that the &s;ubject
upon every occa&s;ion, in which his legal intere&s;t is con|cerned,
may know beforehand how to act, and what to
expect. To &s;et judges free from any obligation, to con|form
them&s;elves to the deci&s;ions of their predece&s;&s;ors would
be to lay open a latitude of judging, with, which, no de|&s;cription
<PB N="509" REF="549">
of men can &s;afely be entru&s;ted: it would be to
allow &s;pace for the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e concealed partialities,
which, &s;ince they cannot by any human policy be excluded,
ought to be confined by boundaries and land marks. It is
in vain to alledge, that the &s;uperintendency of parliament
is always at hand to control and puni&s;h abu&s;es of judicial
di&s;cretion. By what rules can parliament proceed? Who
&s;hall pronounce a deci&s;ion to be wrong, where there exi&s;ts
no acknowledged mea&s;ure or &s;tandard of what is right,
which, in a multitude of in&s;tances, would be the ca&s;e,
is prior determinations were no longer to be appealed to?</P>
<P>Dimini&s;hing the danger of partiality, is one thing gained
by adhering to precedents; but not the principal thing.
The &s;ubject of every &s;y&s;tem of laws mu&s;t expect that de|ci&s;ion
in his own ca&s;e, which he knows that others have
received in ca&s;es &s;imilar to his. If he expect not this, he
can expect nothing. There exi&s;ts no other rule or principle
of rea&s;oning, by which he can &s;oretell, or even conjecture
the event of a judicial conte&s;t. To remove there&s;ore the
ground of this expectation, by rejecting the force and
authority of precedents, is to entail upon the &s;ubject the
wor&s;t property of &s;lavery&mdash;to have no a&s;&s;urance of his
rights, or knowledge of his duty. But the quiet of the coun|try,
no le&s;s than the con&s;idence and &s;atisfaction of each
man's mind, as well as the direction of each man's conduct,
requires the &s;ame thing. Nothing completely puts an end
to &s;trife, but a rigid adherence to known rules of adjudi|cation.
Nothing quells a &s;pirit of litigation, like de&s;|pair
of &s;ucce&s;s. Whil&s;t the event is uncertain, which
<PB N="510" REF="550">
it mu&s;t be, when it is uncertain whether former deter|minations
upon the &s;ame &s;ubject will be followed or not,
law &s;uits will be endle&s;s and innumerable: men will con|tinually
engage in them, either from the hope of prevail|ing
in their claims, which the &s;malle&s;t chance is &s;ufficient
to encourage; or with the de&s;ign of intimidating their ad|ver&s;ary
by the terrors of a dubious litigation. When ju&s;tice
is rendered to the parties, but half the bu&s;ine&s;s of a court
of ju&s;tice is done: the more important part of its office
remains&mdash;to put an end, for the future, to every fear, and
quarrel, and expence upon the fame point; and &s;o to regu|late
its proceedings, that not only a doubt once decided,
may be &s;tirred no more, but that the whole train of
law-&s;uits, which i&s;&s;ue from one uncertainty, may die
with the parent que&s;tion. Now this advantage can only
be attained by con&s;idering each deci&s;ion as a direction to
&s;ucceeding judges, whenever a like di&s;pute comes before
them. And it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that every departure
from former determinations, e&s;pecially if often repeated,
or long &s;ubmitted to, &s;hakes the &s;tability of all legal title.
It is not fixing the point anew; it is leaving it unfixed.
For by the &s;ame &s;tretch of power, by which the pre&s;ent
race of judges take upon them to contradict the judgment
of their predece&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e who try the que&s;tion next. may
&s;et a&s;ide theirs.</P>
<P>From an adherence however to precedents, by which
&s;o much is gained to the public, two con&s;equences ari&s;e
which are often lamented; the hard&s;hip of particular
<PB N="511" REF="551">
ca&s;es, and the intricacy of the &s;cience. As to the fir&s;t of
the&s;e complaints, whenever &s;uch ca&s;es occur, we mu&s;t
apply to them this reflection, &startq;that uniformity is of more
importance than equity, in proportion as general uncer|tainty
would be a greater evil than particular inju&s;tice.&endq;
The &s;econd is attended with no greater inconveniency
than the erecting the practice of the law into a &s;eparate
profe&s;&s;ion: and which becomes nece&s;&s;ary on this account;
for if we attribute &s;o much authority to precedents, it is
evident they ought to be known in every cau&s;e, both to
the advocates and the judge: this knowledge cannot be
general, &s;ince it is the fruit oftentimes of laborious re|&s;earch,
or demands a memory &s;tored with long-collected
erudition.</P>
<P>To a mind revolving upon the &s;ubject of human juri&s;|prudence,
there frequently occurs this, que&s;tion; why,
&s;ince the maxims of natural ju&s;tice are few and evident, do
there ari&s;e &s;o many doubts and controver&s;ies in the appli|cation?
Or, in other words, how comes it to pa&s;s, that,
although the principles of the law of nature be &s;imple,
and for the mo&s;t part &s;ufficiently obvious, there &s;hould
exi&s;t neverthele&s;s, in every &s;y&s;tem of municipal laws, and in
the actual admini&s;tration of relative ju&s;tice, numerous uncer|tainties
and acknowledged difficulty? Whence, it may be
a&s;ked, &s;o much room for litigation, and &s;o many &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
di&s;putes, if the rules of human duty be neither ob&s;cure
nor dubious? If a &s;y&s;tem of morality, containing both the
precepts of revelation, and: the deductions of rea&s;on? may
<PB N="512" REF="552">
be compri&s;ed within, the compa&s;s of one moderate volume;
and the morali&s;t be able, as he pretends, to de&s;cribe the
rights and obligations of mankind, in all the different re|lations
they may hold to one another; what need of tho&s;e
codes of po&s;itive and particular in&s;titutions, of tho&s;e tomes
of &s;tatutes and reports, which require the employment of
a long life even to peru&s;e? And this que&s;tion is immedi|ately
connected with the argument treated of in the pre|ceding
paragraph; for unle&s;s there be found &s;ome greater
uncertainty in the law of nature, or what may be called
natural equity, when it comes to be applied to real ca&s;es
and actual adjudication, than what appears in the rules
and principles of the &s;cience, as delivered in the writings
of tho&s;e who treat of the &s;ubject, it were better that the
determination of every cau&s;e were left to the con&s;cience of
judges, unfettered by precedents and authorities; &s;ince the
very purpo&s;e, for which the&s;e are introduced, is to give a
certainty to judicial proceedings, which they would want
without them.</P>
<P>Now to account for the exi&s;tence of &s;o many &s;ources
of litigation, notwithstanding the clearne&s;s and per|fection
of natural ju&s;tice, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, in the
fir&s;t place, that treati&s;es of morality always &s;uppo&s;e
facts to be a&s;certained; and not only &s;o, but the intention
likewi&s;e of the parties to be known and laid bare. For
example, when we pronounce that promi&s;es ought to be
fulfilled in that &s;en&s;e in which the promi&s;er apprehended,
at the time of making the promi&s;e, the other party re|ceived
and under&s;tood it, the apprehen&s;ion of one &s;ide,
<PB N="513" REF="553">
and the expectation of the other, mu&s;t be di&s;covered, be|fore
this rule can be reduced to practice, or applied to
the determination of any actual di&s;pute. Wherefore the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of facts, which the morali&s;t &s;uppo&s;es to be &s;et|tled;
the di&s;covery of intentions, which he pre&s;umes to be
known, &s;till remain to exerci&s;e the enquiry of courts of
ju&s;tice. And as the&s;e facts and intentions are often to
be inferred or rather conjectured, from ob&s;cure indications,
&s;u&s;picious te&s;timony, and a compari&s;on of oppo&s;ite and
contending probabilities, they afford a never-failing &s;up|ply
of doubt and litigation. For this rea&s;on, as hath been
ob&s;erved in a former part of this work, the &s;cience of
morality is to be considered rather as a direction to the
parties, who are con&s;cious of their own thoughts, and
motives, and de&s;igns, and to which con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s the
teacher of morality con&s;tantly appeals; than as a guide to
the judge, or to any third per&s;on, who&s;e arbitration mu&s;t
proceed upon rules of evidence, and maxims of credibility,
with which the morali&s;t has no concern.</P>
<P>Secondly, there exi&s;t a multitude of ca&s;es, in which the
law of nature, that is, the law of public expediency pre|&s;cribes
nothing, except that &s;ome certain rule be adhered
to, and that the rule actually e&s;tabli&s;hed be pre&s;erved; it
being either indifferent what rule obtains, or out of many
rules, no one being &s;o much more advantageous than the
re&s;t, as to recompence the inconveniency of an alteration.
In all &s;uch ca&s;es the law of nature &s;ends us to the law of
the land. She directs either that &s;ome fixed rule be in|troduced
<PB N="514" REF="554">
by an act of the legi&s;lature, or that the rule
which accident, or cu&s;tom, or common con&s;ent have al|ready
e&s;tabli&s;hed, be &s;teadily maintained. Thus, in the
de&s;cent of lands or the inheritance of per&s;onals from
inte&s;tate proprietors, whether the kindred of the grand|mother,
or of the great grandmother, &s;hall be preferred
in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; whether the degrees of con&s;anguinity
h&s;all be computed through the common ance&s;tor, or from
him: whether the widow &s;hall take a third or a moiety
of her hu&s;band's fortune; whether &s;ons &s;hall be preferred
to daughters, or the elder to the younger; whether the
di&s;tinction of age &s;hall be regarded among&s;t &s;i&s;ters, as well
as between brothers; in the&s;e, and in a great variety of
que&s;tions which the &s;ame &s;ubject &s;upplies, the law of na|ture
determines nothing. The only an&s;wer &s;he returns
to our enquiries is, that &s;ome certain and general rule be
laid down by public authority; be obeyed when laid
down; and that the quiet of the country be not di&s;|turbed,
nor the expectation of heirs fru&s;trated by Capri|cious
innovations. This &s;ilence or neutrality of the law
of nature, which we have exemplified in the cafe of in|te&s;tacy,
holds concerning a great part of the que&s;tions that
relate to the right or acquisition of property. Recour&s;e
then mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be had to &s;tatutes, or precedents, or
u&s;age, to fix what the law of nature has left loo&s;e. The
interpretation of the&s;e &s;tatutes, the &s;earch after prece|dents,
the inve&s;tigation of cu&s;toms, compo&s;e therefore an
unavoidable, and at the &s;ame time a large and intricate
portion of foren&s;ic bu&s;ine&s;s. Po&s;itive con&s;titutions or judi|cial
<PB N="515" REF="555">
authorities are, in like manner, wanted to give preci&s;ion
to many things, which are in their own nature <HI>indeter|minate.</HI>
The age of legal di&s;cretion; at what time of
life a per&s;on &s;hall be deemed competent to the perform|ance
of any act, which may bind his property; whether
at twenty, or twenty one, or earlier or later, or at &s;ome
point of time between the&s;e years, can only be a&s;certained
by a po&s;itive rule of the &s;ociety to which the party be|longs.
Nature has a&s;&s;igned no period for this; the hu|man
under&s;tanding advancing to maturity by in&s;en&s;ible
degrees, and its progre&s;s varying in different individuals.
Yet it is nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of mutual &s;ecurity, that a
preci&s;e age be fixed, and that what is fixed be known to
all. It is on the&s;e occa&s;ions that the intervention of law
&s;upplies the incon&s;tancy of nature. Again, there are
other things which are perfectly <HI>arbitrary,</HI> and capable of
no certainty but what is given them by positive regulation.
It is nece&s;&s;ary that a limited time &s;Hould be a&s;&s;igned to
defendants, to plead to the complaints alledged again&s;t
them; and al&s;o that the default of pleading within a cer|tain,
time, &s;hould be taken for a confe&s;&s;ion of the charge:
but to how many days or months that term &s;hould be ex|tended,
though nece&s;&s;ary to be known with certainty,
cannot be known at all, by any information which the
law of nature affords. And the &s;ame remark &s;eems appli|cable
to almo&s;t all tho&s;e rules of proceeding, which con|stitute
what is called the practice of the courts as they
cannot be traced out by rea&s;oning, they mu&s;t be fettled
by authority.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="556">
Thirdly, in contracts whether expre&s;s or implied,
which involve a great number of conditions, as in tho&s;e
which are entered into between ma&s;ters and &s;ervants,
principals and agents; many al&s;o of merchandize, or for
works of art; &s;ome likewi&s;e which relate to the negocia|tion
of money or bills, or to the acceptance of credit or
&s;ecurity; the original de&s;ign and expectation of the parties
was, that both &s;ides &s;hould be guided by the cour&s;e and cu&s;|tom
of the country in tran&s;actions of the &s;ame &s;ort. Con|&s;equently,
when the&s;e contracts come to be di&s;puted, na|tural
ju&s;tice can only refer to that cu&s;tom. But as &s;uch
cu&s;toms are not always &s;ufficiently uniform or notorious,
but often to be collected from the production and compa|ri&s;on
of in&s;tances and accounts repugnant to one another;
and each cu&s;tom being only that, after all, which among&s;t
a variety of u&s;ages &s;eems to predominate, we have <HI>here</HI>
al&s;o ample room for doubt and conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as the law of nature founded in the very
con&s;truction of human &s;ociety, which is to endure through
a &s;eries of peri&s;hing generations, requires that the ju&s;t en|gagements
a man enters into, &s;hould continue in force be|yond
his own life; it follows that the private rights of
per&s;ons frequently depend upon what has been tran&s;acted,
in times remote from the pre&s;ent, by their ance&s;tors or
predece&s;&s;ors, by tho&s;e under whom they claim, or to
who&s;e obligations they have &s;ucceeded. Thus the que&s;tions
which u&s;ually ari&s;e between lords of manors, and their
tenants, between the king and tho&s;e who claim royal
<PB N="517" REF="557">
franchi&s;es, or between them and the per&s;ons affected by
the&s;e fnanchi&s;es, depend upon the terms of the original
grant. In like manner every di&s;pute concerning tythes, in
which an exemption or compo&s;ition is pleaded, depends
upon the agreement which took place between the predece&s;|&s;or
of the claimant, and the ancient owner of the land.
The appeal to the&s;e grants and agreements is dictated
by natural equity, as well as by the municipal law: but
concerning the exi&s;tence, or the conditions of &s;uch old
covenants, doubts will perpetually occur, to which the
law of nature affords no &s;olution. The lo&s;s or decay of
records, the peri&s;hablene&s;s of living memory, the corup|tion
and carele&s;sne&s;s of tradition, all con&s;pire to multiply
uncertainties upon this head; what cannot be produced
or proved, mu&s;t be left to loo&s;e and fallible pre&s;umption.
Under the &s;ame head may be included another topic of al|tercation;
the tracing out of boundaries, which time, or
neglect, or unity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or mixture of occupation
have confounded or obliterated. To which &s;hould be
added a difficulty which often pre&s;ents it&s;elf in di&s;putes
concerning rights of <HI>way,</HI> both public and private, and of
tho&s;e ea&s;ements which one man claims in another mans
property; namely, that of di&s;tingui&s;hing, after a lap&s;e of
years, the u&s;e of an indulgence from the exerci&s;e of a
right.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The quantity or extent of an injury, even
when the cau&s;e and author of it are known, is often du|bious
and undefined. If the injury con&s;i&s;t in the lo&s;s of
<PB N="518" REF="558">
&s;ome &s;pecific property, the value of the property con&s;ti|tutes
the amount of the injury: but what a man may
have &s;ufrered in his per&s;on, from an a&s;&s;ault; in his repu|tation,
by &s;lander; or in the comfort of his life, by the
&s;edudtion of a wife or daughter; or what &s;um of money
&s;hall be deemed a reparation for the damage, cannot be
a&s;certained by any rules which the law of nature &s;upplies.
The law of nature commands that reparation be made; and
adds to her command, that when the aggre&s;&s;or and the
&s;ufterer di&s;agree, the damage be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by authorized and
indifferent arbitrators. Here then recour&s;e mu&s;t be had
to courts of law, not only with the permi&s;&s;ion, but in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, by the direction of natural ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sixthly, When controver&s;ies ari&s;e in the interpretation
of written laws, they ari&s;e upon contingencies, which the
compo&s;er of the law did not fore&s;ee or think of. In the
adjudication of &s;uch ca&s;es, this dilemma pre&s;ents it&s;elf:
if the laws be permitted to operate only upon the cafes,
which were actually contemplated by the law makers,
they will always be found defective: if they be extended
to every ca&s;e, to which the rea&s;oning and &s;pirit and ex|pediency
of the provi&s;ion &s;eem to belong, without any far|ther
evidence of the intention of the legi&s;lature, we &s;hall
allow to the judges a liberty of applying the law, which
will fall very little &s;hort of the power of making it. If a
literal con&s;truction be adhered to, the law will often fail
of its end: if a loo&s;e and vague expo&s;ition be admitted,
the law might as well have never been enacted; for this
<PB N="519" REF="559">
licen&s;e will bring back into the &s;ubjedt all the uncertainty
which it was the de&s;ign of the legi&s;lature to take away.
Courts of ju&s;tice are, and always mu&s;t be embara&s;&s;ed by
the&s;e oppo&s;ite difficulties: and as it can never be known
beforehand, in what degree either con&s;ideration may pre|vail
in the mind of the judge, there remains an unavoid|able
cau&s;e of doubt, and a place for contention.</P>
<P>Seventhly, the deliberations of courts of ju&s;tice upon
every <HI>new</HI> que&s;tion are incumbered with additional diff|iculties,
in con&s;equence of the authority which the judg|ment
of the court po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as a precedent to future judi|catures:
which authority appertains not only to the
conclu&s;ions the court delivers, but to the principles
and arguments upon which they are built. The view
of this effect makes it nece&s;&s;ary for a judge to look be|yond
the ca&s;e before him; and, be&s;ide the attention he
owes to the truth and ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e between the
parties, to reflect whether the principles, and maxims, and
rea&s;oning, which he adopts and authorizes, can be applied
with &s;afety to all ca&s;es, which admit of a compari&s;on
with the pre&s;ent. The deci&s;ion of the cau&s;e, were the
effects of the deci&s;ion to &s;top there, might be ea&s;y: but
the con&s;equence of e&s;tabli&s;hing the principle, which &s;uch
a deci&s;ion a&s;&s;umes, may be difficult, though of the utmo&s;t
importance, to be fore&s;een and regulated.</P>
<P>Finally, after all the certainty and re&s;t that can be given
to points of law, either by the interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;la|ture,
<PB N="520" REF="560">
or the authority of precedents, one principal &s;ource
of di&s;putation will remain &s;till, and into which indeed the
greater part of legal controver&s;ies may be re&s;olved, namely,
&startq;a competition of oppo&s;ite analogies.&endq; When a point of
law has been once adjudged, neither that que&s;tion, nor any
which completely, and in all its circum&s;tances, corre&s;ponds
with <HI>that,</HI> can be brought a &s;econd time into di&s;pute: but
que&s;tions ari&s;e, which re&s;emble this only indirectly and
in part, in certain views and circum&s;tances, and which
may &s;eem to bear an equal or a greater affinity to other
adjudged ca&s;es; que&s;tions, which can be brought within
any fixed rule only by analogy, and which hold a relation
by analogy to different rules. It is by the urging of the&s;e
different analogies that the contention of the bar is carried
on: and it is in the compari&s;on, adju&s;tment, and reconci|liation
of them with one another; in the di&s;cerning of
&s;uch di&s;tinctions, and in the framing of &s;uch a determina|tion,
as may either &s;ave the various rules alledged in
the cau&s;e, or, if that be impo&s;&s;ible, may give up the
weaker analogy to the &s;tronger, that the &s;agacity and
wi&s;dom of the court are &s;een and exerci&s;ed. Among&s;t a
thou&s;and in&s;tances of this, we may cite one of general no|toriety
in the conte&s;t that has lately been agitated con|cerning
literary property. Here the per&s;onal indu&s;try,
which an author expends upon the compo&s;ition of his
work, bears &s;o near a re&s;emblance to that, by which
every other kind of property is earned, or de&s;erved, or
acquired; or rather there exi&s;ts &s;uch a corre&s;pondency be|tween
what is created by the &s;tudy of a man's mind, and
<PB N="521" REF="561">
the production of his labour, in any other way of apply|ing
it, that he &s;eems entitled to the &s;ame exclu&s;ive, a&s;|&s;ignable,
and perpetual right in both; and that right
to the &s;ame protection of law. This is the analogy
contended for on one &s;ide. On the other hand, a book,
as to the authors right in it, appears &s;imilar to an inven|tion
of art, as a machine, an engine, a medicine. And,
&s;ince the law permits the&s;e to be copied, or imitated, ex|cept
where an exclu&s;ive u&s;e or &s;ale is re&s;erved to the in|ventor
by patent, the &s;ame liberty &s;hould be allowed in
the publication and &s;ale of books. This is the analogy
maintained by the advocates of an open trade. And the
competition of the&s;e oppo&s;ite analogies con&s;tituted the
difficulty of the ca&s;e, as far as the &s;ame was argued, or
adjudged upon principles of common law&mdash;One example
may &s;erve to illu&s;trate our meaning; but whoever takes
up a volume of reports, will find mo&s;t of the arguments
it contains capable of the &s;ame analy&s;is; although the ana|logies,
it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are &s;ometimes &s;o entangled as
not to be ea&s;ily unravelled, or even perceived.</P>
<P>Doubtful and ob&s;cure points of law are not however
nearly &s;o numerous, as they are apprehended to be. Out
of the multitude of cau&s;es, which in the cour&s;e of each
year, are brought to trial in the metropolis, or upon the
circuits, there are few in which any point is re&s;erved for
the judgment of &s;uperior courts. Yet the&s;e few con|tain
all the doubts, with which the law is chargeable: for
<PB N="522" REF="562">
as to the re&s;t, the uncertainty, as hath been &s;hown above,
is not in the law, but in the means of human information.</P>
<P>There are two peculiarities in the judicial con&s;titution
of this country, which do not carry with them the &s;ame
evidence of their propriety, that recommends almo&s;t every
other part of the &s;y&s;tem. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the rule,
which requires that juries be <HI>unanimous</HI> in their verdicts.
To expect that twelve men, taken by lot out of a promi&s;|cuous
multitude, &s;hould agree in their opinion upon points
confe&s;&s;edly dubious; and upon which often the wi&s;e&s;t
judgments might be held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; or to &s;uppo&s;e
that any real <HI>unanimity,</HI> or change of opinion in the di&s;|&s;enting
jurors, could be procured by confining them until
they all con&s;ented to the &s;ame verdict; be&s;peaks more of
the conceit of a barbarous age, than of the policy which
could dictate &s;uch an in&s;titution as that of juries. Ne|verthele&s;s,
the effects of this rule are not &s;o detrimental,
as the rule it&s;elf is unrea&s;onable: in criminal pro&s;ecutions
it operates con&s;iderably in favour of the pri&s;oner; for if a
juror find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urrender to the ob&s;tinacy of
others, he will much more readily re&s;ign his opinion on
the &s;ide of mercy, than of condemnation: in civil &s;uits it
adds weight to the direction of the judge; for when a
conference with one another does not &s;eem likely to pro|duce,
in the jury, the agreement that is nece&s;&s;ary, they
will naturally clo&s;e their di&s;putes by a common &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to the opinion delivered from the bench. However, there
&s;eems to be le&s;s of the concurrence of &s;eparate judgments
<PB N="523" REF="563">
in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion; con&s;equently, le&s;s a&s;&s;urance that
the conclu&s;ion is founded in rea&s;ons of apparent truth and
ju&s;tice, than if the deci&s;ion were left to a plurality, or
&s;ome certain majority of voices.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cirum&s;tance in our con&s;titution, which,
however it may &s;ucceed in practice, does not &s;eem to
have been &s;ugge&s;ted by any intelligible fitne&s;s in the nature
of the thing, is the choice that is made of the <HI>Hou&s;e of
Lords,</HI> as a court of appeal from every civil court of judi|cature
in the kingdom; and of the la&s;t al&s;o and highe&s;t
appeal, to which the &s;ubject can re&s;ort. There appears to be
nothing in the con&s;titution of that a&s;&s;embly; in the edu|cation,
habits, character, or profe&s;&s;ions of the members
who compo&s;e it; in the mode of their appointment, or
the right by which they &s;ucceed to their places in it,
that &s;hould qualify them for this arduous office: except,
perhaps, that the elevation of their rank and fortune af|fords
a &s;ecurity again&s;t the offer and influence of &s;mall
bribes. Officers of the army and navy, courtiers, eccle|&s;ia&s;ties;
young men who have ju&s;t attained the age of
twenty-one, and who have pa&s;&s;ed their youth in the
di&s;&s;ipation and pur&s;uits which commonly accompany
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or inheritance of great fortunes; coun|try
gentlemen occupied in the management of their
e&s;tates, or the care of their dome&s;tic concerns and family
intere&s;ts; the greater part of the a&s;&s;embly born to their
&s;tation, that is, placed in it by chance; mo&s;t of the re&s;t
advanced to the peerage, for &s;ervices, and from motives
<PB N="524" REF="564">
utterly unconnected with legal erudition&mdash;the&s;e men
compo&s;e the tribunal, to which the con&s;titution entru&s;ts
the interpretation of her laws, and the ultimate deci&s;ion
of every di&s;pute between her &s;ubjects. The&s;e are the men
a&s;&s;igned to review judgments of law, pronounced by &s;ages
of the profe&s;&s;ion, who have &s;pent their lives in the &s;tudy
and practice of the juri&s;prudence of their country. Such is
the order which our ance&s;tors have e&s;tabli&s;hed. The effect
only proves the truth of this maxim, &startq;that when a &s;ingle in|&s;titution
is extremely di&s;&s;onant from other parts of the &s;y&s;tem
to which it belongs, it will always find &s;ome way of re|conciling
it&s;elf to the analogy which governs and pervades
the re&s;t.&endq; By con&s;tantly placing in the Hou&s;e of Lords
&s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent and experienced lawyers
in the kingdom; by calling to their aid the advice
of the judges, when any ab&s;tract que&s;tion of law
awaits their determination; by the almo&s;t implicit and un|di&s;puted
deference, which the uninformed part of the
hou&s;e find it nece&s;&s;ary to pay to the learning of their col|leagues,
the appeal to the Hou&s;e of Lords becomes an
appeal to the collected wi&s;dom of our &s;upreme courts of
ju&s;tice: receiving indeed &s;olemnity, but little perhaps of
direction or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the pre&s;ence of the augu&s;t a&s;|&s;embly,
in which it is heard and determined.</P>
<P>The&s;e however, if real, are in their con&s;equences mi|nute
imperfections. A politician, who &s;hould &s;it down to
delineate a plan for the di&s;pen&s;ation of public ju&s;tice,
guarded again&s;t all acce&s;s to influence and corruption, and
<PB N="525" REF="565">
bringing together the &s;eparate advantages of knowledge
and impartiality, would find, when he had done, that he
had been tran&s;cribing the judicial con&s;titution of England.
And it may teach the mo&s;t di&s;contented among&s;t us to
acquie&s;ce in the government of his country, to reflect,
that the pure, and wi&s;e, and equal admini&s;tration of the
laws, forms the fir&s;t end and ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ocial union; and
that this ble&s;&s;ing is enjoyed by him in a perfection, which
he will &s;eek in vain, in any other nation of the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Crimes and Puni&s;hments.</HEAD>
<P>THE proper end of human puni&s;hment is, not the
&s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice, but the prevention of crimes.
By the &s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice, I mean the retribution of &s;o
much pain for &s;o much guilt; which is the di&s;pen&s;ation
we expect at the hand of God, and which we are accu&s;|tomed
to con&s;ider as the order of things that perfect ju&s;tice
dictates and requires. In what &s;en&s;e, or whether with
truth in any &s;en&s;e, ju&s;tice may be &s;aid to demand the
puni&s;hment of offenders, I do not now enquire; but I a&s;&s;ert
that this <HI>demand</HI> is not the motive or occa&s;ion of human
puni&s;hment. What would it be to the magi&s;trate that
offences went altogether unpuni&s;hed, if the impunity of
the offenders were followed by no danger or prejudice to
the commonwealth? The fear left the e&s;cape of the
criminal &s;hould encourage him, or others by his example,
<PB N="527" REF="567">
to repeat the &s;ame crime, or to commit different crimes,
is the &s;ole con&s;ideration which authorizes the infliction of
puni&s;hment by human laws. Now that, whatever it be,
which is the cau&s;e and end of the puni&s;hment, ought un|doubtedly
to regulate the mea&s;ure of its &s;everity. But
this cau&s;e appears to be founded, not in the guilt of the
offender, but in the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing the repetition
of the offence. And from hence re&s;ults the rea&s;on, that
crimes are not by any government, nor, in all ca&s;es, ought
to be puni&s;hed, in proportion to their guilt, but in propor|tion
to the difficulty and the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing
them. Thus the &s;tealing of goods privately out of a &s;hop,
may not, in its moral quality, be more, criminal, than the
&s;tealing of them out of a hou&s;e; yet, being equally nece&s;|&s;ary,
and more difficult to be prevented, the law, in certain
circum&s;tances, denounces again&s;t it a &s;everer puni&s;hment:
that is, the crime mu&s;t be prevented by &s;ome means or
other; and con&s;equently, whatever means appear nece&s;&s;ary
to this end, whether they be proportionable to the guilt
of the criminal or not, are adopted rightly, becau&s;e they
are adopted upon the principle which alone ju&s;tifies the
infliction of puni&s;hment at all. From the &s;ame con&s;idera|tion
it al&s;o follows, that puni&s;hment ought not to be em|ployed,
much le&s;s rendered &s;evere, when the crime can
be prevented by any other means. Puni&s;hment is an evil
to which the magi&s;trate re&s;orts only from its being nece&s;|&s;ary
to the prevention of a greater. This nece&s;&s;ity does
not exi&s;t, when the end may be attained, that is, when
the public may be defended from the effects of the crime,
<PB N="528" REF="568">
by any other expedient. The &s;anguinary laws which
have been made again&s;t counterfeiting or dimini&s;hing the
gold coin of the kingdom might be ju&s;t, until the method
of detecting the fraud, by weighing the money, was intro|duced
into general u&s;age. Since that precaution was prac|ti&s;ed,
the&s;e laws have &s;lept: and an execution under
them would be deemed, at this day, a mea&s;ure of un|ju&s;tifiable
&s;everity. The &s;ame principle accounts for a
circum&s;tance, which has been often cen&s;ured as an ab|&s;urdity
in the penal laws of this, and of mo&s;t modern na|tions,
namely, that breaches of tru&s;t are either not pun|i&s;hed
at all, or puni&s;hed with le&s;s rigour than other
frauds&mdash;wherefore is it, &s;ome have a&s;ked, that a violation
of confidence, which increa&s;es the guilt, &s;hould mitigate
the penalty. This lenity, or rather forbearance of the
laws is founded in the mo&s;t rea&s;onable di&s;tinction. A due
and practicable circum&s;pection in the choice of the per|&s;ons,
whom they tru&s;t; caution in limiting the extent of
that tru&s;t; or the requiring of &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the
faithful di&s;charge of it, will commonly guard men from
injuries of this de&s;cription: and the law will not interpo&s;e
its &s;anctions, to protect negligence and credulity, or to &s;up|ply
the place of private care and prudence. To be con|vinced
that the law proceeds entirely upon this con&s;idera|tion,
we have only to ob&s;erve, that, where the confidence
is unavoidable, where no practicable vigilance could watch
the offender, as in the ca&s;e of theft committed by a &s;ervant
in the &s;hop or dwelling-hou&s;e of his ma&s;ter, or upon pro|perty
to which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have acce&s;s, the &s;en|tence
<PB N="529" REF="569">
of the law is not le&s;s &s;evere, and its execution com|monly
more certain and rigorous, than if no tru&s;t at all
had intervened.</P>
<P>It is in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame principle, which pervades
indeed the whole &s;y&s;tem of penal jurisprudence, that the faci|lity
with which any &s;pecies of crimes is perpetrated, has been
generally deemed a rea&s;on for aggravating the puni&s;hment.
Thus, &s;heep-&s;tealing, hor&s;e &s;tealing; the &s;tealing of cloth
from tenters, or bleaching grounds, by our laws, &s;ubject
the offenders to &s;entence of death: not that the&s;e crimes
are in their nature more heinous, than many &s;imple felo|nies
which are puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment or tran&s;porta|tion,
but becau&s;e the property being more expo&s;ed, re|quires
the terror of capital puni&s;hment to protect it. This
&s;everity would be ab&s;urd and unju&s;t, if the guilt of the
offender were the immediate cau&s;e and mea&s;ure of the
puni&s;hment; but is a con&s;i&s;tent and regular con&s;equence
of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the right of puni&s;hment re&s;ults
from the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing the crime: for if this be
the end propo&s;ed, the &s;everity of the puni&s;hment mu&s;t be
increa&s;ed in proportion to the expediency and the difficul|ty
of attaining this end; that is, in a proportion compounded
of the mi&s;chief of the crime, and the ea&s;e with which it
is executed. The difficulty of di&s;covery is a circum&s;tance
to be included in the &s;ame con&s;ideration. It con&s;titutes
indeed, with re&s;pect to the crime, the facility we &s;peak of.
By how much therefore the detection of the offender is
more rare and uncertain, by &s;o much the more &s;evere
<PB N="530" REF="570">
mu&s;t be the puni&s;hment, when he is detected. Thus the
writing of incendiary letters, though in it&s;elf a pernicious
and alarming injury, calls for a more condign and exem|plary
puni&s;hment, by the very ob&s;curity with which the
crime is committed.</P>
<P>From the ju&s;tice of God we are taught to look for a
gradation of puni&s;hment, exactly proportioned to the guilt
of the offender: when therefore, in a&s;&s;igning the degrees
of human puni&s;hment, we introduce con&s;iderations di|&s;tinct
from that guilt, and a proportion &s;o varied by ex|ternal
circum&s;tances, that equal crimes frequently under|go
unequal puni&s;hments, or the le&s;s crime the greater; it
is natural to demand the rea&s;on why a different mea&s;ure
of puni&s;hment &s;hould be expected from God, and ob&s;erved
by man; why that rule, which befits the ab&s;olute and
perfect ju&s;tice of the Deity, &s;hould not be the rule which
ought to be pur&s;ued and imitated by human laws. The
&s;olution of this difficulty mu&s;t be &s;ought for in tho&s;e pe|culiar
attributes of the divine nature, which di&s;tingui&s;h
the di&s;pen&s;ations of &s;upreme wi&s;dom from the proceed|ings
of human judicature. A Being who&s;e knowledge
penetrates every concealment; from the operation of who&s;e
will no art or flight can e&s;cape; and in who&s;e hands
puni&s;hment is &s;ure; &s;uch a Being may conduct the moral
government of his creation, in the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t manner,
by pronouncing a law that every crime &s;hould finally re|ceive
a puni&s;hment proportioned to the guilt which it
contains, ab&s;tracted from any foreign consideration what|ever;
<PB N="531" REF="571">
and may te&s;tify his veracity to the &s;pectators of his
judgments, by carrying this law into &s;trict execution.
But when the care of the public &s;afety is entru&s;ted to men,
who&s;e authority over their fellow creatures is limited by
defects of power and knowledge; from who&s;e utmo&s;t vigi|lence
and &s;agacity the greate&s;t offenders often lie hid;
who&s;e wi&s;e&s;t provi&s;ions and &s;peedie&s;t pur&s;uit may be
eluded by artifice or concealment; a different nece&s;&s;ity, a
new rule of proceeding re&s;ults from the very imperfection
of their faculties. In their hands the uncertainty of pun|ishment
mu&s;t be compen&s;ated: by the &s;everity. The ea&s;e
with which crimes are committed or concealed, mu&s;t be
counteracted by additional penalties and increa&s;ed terrors.
The very end, for which human government is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
requires that its regulations be adapted to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion
of crimes. This end, whatever it may do in the plans
of infinite wi&s;dom, does not in the de&s;ignation of tem|poral
penalties, always coincide with the proportionate
punishment of guilt.</P>
<P>There are two methods of admini&s;tring penal ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t method a&s;&s;igns capital puni&s;hments to few of|fences,
and invariably inflicts it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd method a&s;&s;igns capital puni&s;hments to many
kinds of offences, but inflicts it only upon a few examples
of each kind.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="572">
The latter of which two methods has been long adopt|ed
in this country, where, of tho&s;e who receive &s;entence
of death, &s;carce one in ten is executed. And the prefer|ence
of this to the former method &s;eems to be founded
in the con&s;ideration, that the &s;election of proper objects
for capital puni&s;hment principally depends upon circum|&s;tances,
which, however ea&s;y to perceive in each particular
ca&s;e, after the crime is committed, it is impo&s;&s;ible to enu|merate
or define beforehand, or to a&s;certain however with
that exactne&s;s, which is requi&s;ite in legal de&s;criptions.
Hence, although it be nece&s;&s;ary to fix the boundary on
one &s;ide, that is, the limit to which the puni&s;hment may
be extended, by preci&s;e rules of law; and al&s;o that no|thing
le&s;s than the authority of the whole legi&s;lature be
&s;uffered to determine and a&s;&s;ign the&s;e rules; yet, the miti|gation
of puni&s;hment, the exerci&s;e of lenity, may, with|out
danger, be entru&s;ted to the executive magi&s;trate, who&s;e
di&s;cretion will operate upon tho&s;e numerous, unfore&s;een,
mutable, and indefinite circum&s;tances, both of the crime and
the criminal, which con&s;titute or qualify the malignity
of each offence. Without the power of relaxation lodged
in a living authority, either &s;ome offenders would e&s;cape
capital puni&s;hment, whom the public &s;afety required
to &s;uffer; or others would undergo this puni&s;hment,
where it was neither de&s;erved nor nece&s;&s;ary. For if judg|ment
of death were re&s;erved for one or two &s;pecies of
crimes only, which would probably be the ca&s;e if that
judgment was meant to be executed without exception,
crimes might occur of the mo&s;t dangerous example, and
<PB N="533" REF="573">
attended with circum&s;tances of heinous aggravation, which
did not fall within <HI>any</HI> de&s;cription of capital offences,
and con&s;equently could not receive the puni&s;hment their
own malignity and the public &s;afety required&mdash;and what
is wor&s;e, it would be known beforehand, that &s;uch crimes
might be committed, without danger to the offender's life.
On the other hand, if, to reach the&s;e po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, the
whole cla&s;s of offences to which they belong be &s;ubjected
to pains of death, and no power of remitting this &s;e|verity
remain any where, the execution of the laws will
become more &s;anguinary, than the public compa&s;&s;ion
would endure, or than is nece&s;&s;ary to the general &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The law of England is con&s;tructed upon a different and
a better policy. By the number of &s;tatutes creating capital
offences, it &s;weeps into the net every crime, which under
any po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances may merit the puni&s;hment of
death: but when the execution of this &s;entence comes to
be deliberated upon, a &s;mall proportion of each cla&s;s are
&s;ingled out, the general character, or the peculiar aggra|vations
of who&s;e crimes, render them fit examples of
public ju&s;tice. By this expedient few actually &s;uffer
death, whil&s;t the dread and danger of it hang over the
crimes of many. The tenderne&s;s of the law cannot be
taken advantage of. The life of the &s;ubject is &s;pared, as
far as the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;traint and intimidation permits,
yet no one will adventure upon the commi&s;&s;ion of any
enormous crime, from a knowledge that the laws have
not provided for its puni&s;hment. The wi&s;dom and hu|manity
of this de&s;ign furni&s;h a ju&s;t excu&s;e for the mul|tiplicity
<PB N="534" REF="574">
of capital offences, which the laws of England
are accu&s;ed of containing beyond tho&s;e of other countries.
The charge of cruelty is an&s;wered by ob&s;erving, that the&s;e
laws were never meant to be carried into indi&s;criminate
execution; that the legi&s;lature, when it e&s;tabli&s;hes its la&s;t
and highe&s;t &s;anctions, tru&s;ts to the benignity of the crown
to relax their &s;everity, as often as circum&s;tances appear to
palliate the offence, or even as often as tho&s;e circum&s;tances
of aggravation are wanting, which rendered this rigorous
interpo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary. Upon this plan, it is enough to
vindicate the lenity of the laws, that &s;ome in&s;tances are to
be found in each cla&s;s of capital crimes, which require the
re&s;traint of capital puni&s;hment; and that this re&s;traint
could not be applied, without &s;ubjecting the whole cla&s;s
to the &s;ame condemnation.</P>
<P>There is however one &s;pecies of crimes, the making
of which capital can hardly, I think, be defended, even
upon the comprehen&s;ive principle ju&s;t now &s;tated; I mean,
that of privately &s;tealing from the per&s;on. As every de|gree
of force is excluded by the de&s;cription of the crime,
it will be difficult to a&s;&s;ign an example, where either the
amount or circum&s;tances of the theft place it upon a level
with tho&s;e dangerous attempts, to which the puni&s;hment
of death &s;hould be confined. It will be &s;till more difficult
to &s;how, that, without gro&s;s and culpable negligence on
the part of the &s;ufferer, &s;uch examples are probable, or were
ever &s;o frequent, as to make it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a
cla&s;s of capital offences, of very wide and large extent.</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="575">
The prerogative of pardon is properly re&s;erved to the
chief magi&s;trate. The power of &s;u&s;pending the laws is a
privilege of too high a nature to be committed to many
hands, or to tho&s;e of any inferior officer in the &s;tate.
The King al&s;o can be&s;t collect the advice by which his re&s;o|lutions
&s;hould be governed; and is removed at the greate&s;t
di&s;tance from the influence of private motives. But let
this power be depo&s;ited where it will, the exerci&s;e of it
ought to be regarded, not as the gift of a favour, to be
yielded to &s;olicitation, granted to friend&s;hip, or, lea&s;t of all,
to be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the conciliating or gratifying of
political attachments, but as a judicial act; as a delibera|tion
to be conducted with the &s;ame character of impartiali|ty,
the &s;ame exact and diligent attention to the proper
merits and rea&s;ons and circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, that the
judge upon the bench was expected to maintain and &s;how
in the trial of the pri&s;oner's guilt. The que&s;tions whether
the pri&s;oner be guilty, and whether, being guilty, he ought
to be executed, are equally que&s;tions of public ju&s;tice.
The trial of the one is as much a function of magi&s;tracy
as of the other. The public welfare is intere&s;ted in both.
The conviction of an offender &s;hould depend upon nothing
but the proof of his guilt, nor the execution of the &s;en|tence
upon any thing be&s;ide the quality and circum&s;tances
of his crime. It is nece&s;&s;ary to the good order of &s;ociety,
and to the reputation and authority of government, that
this be known and believed to be the ca&s;e in each part
of the proceeding. The&s;e reflections will &s;how, that
the admi&s;&s;ion of extrin&s;ic or oblique con&s;iderations, in di&s;|pen&s;ing
<PB N="536" REF="576">
the power of pardon, is a crime, in the authors
and advi&s;ers of &s;uch unmerited partiality, of the &s;ame
nature with that of corruption in a judge.</P>
<P>The aggravations which ought to guide the &s;election of objects
for condign puni&s;hment are principally the&s;e three&mdash;repe|tition,
cruelty, combination. The two fir&s;t, it is manife&s;t,
add to every rea&s;on upon which the ju&s;tice or the nece&s;&s;ity
of rigorous mea&s;ures can be founded; and, with re&s;pect
to the la&s;t circum&s;tance, it may be ob&s;erved, that when
thieves and robbers are once collected into gangs, their vi|olence
becomes more formidable, the confederates more
de&s;perate, and the difficulty of defending the public
again&s;t their depredations much greater, than in the ca&s;e
of &s;olitary adventurers. Which &s;everal con&s;iderations
compo&s;e a di&s;tinction, that is properly adverted to, in de|ciding
upon the fate of convicted malefactors.</P>
<P>In crimes however, which are perpetrated by a multi|tude
or a gang, it is proper to &s;eparate, in the puni&s;hment,
the ring-leader from his followers, the principal from his
accomplices, and even the per&s;on who &s;truck the blow,
broke the lock, or fir&s;t entered the hou&s;e, from tho&s;e who
joined him in the felony; not &s;o much on account of any
di&s;tinction in the guilt of the offenders, as for the &s;ake of
ca&s;ting an ob&s;tacle in the way of &s;uch confederacies, by ren|dering
it difficult for the confederates to &s;ettle who &s;hall be|gin
the attack, or to find a man among&s;t their number wil|ling
to expo&s;e him&s;elf to greater danger than his a&s;&s;ociates.
<PB N="537" REF="577">
This is another in&s;tance in which the puni&s;hment, which
expediency directs, does not pur&s;ue the exact propor|tion
of the crime.</P>
<P>Injuries effected by terror and violence, are tho&s;e
which it is the fir&s;t and chief concern of legal government
to repre&s;s: becau&s;e, their extent is unlimited; becau&s;e,
no private precaution can protect the &s;ubject again&s;t them;
becau&s;e, they endanger life and &s;afety, as well as property;
and la&s;tly, becau&s;e, they render the condition of &s;ociety
wretched, by a &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal in&s;ecurity. The&s;e rea|&s;ons
do not apply to frauds, which circum&s;pection may
prevent; which mu&s;t wait for opportunity; which can
proceed only to certain limits; and, by the apprehen|&s;ion
of which, although the bu&s;ine&s;s of life be incom|moded,
life it&s;elf is not made mi&s;erable. The appearance
of this di&s;tinction has led &s;ome humane writers to expre&s;s
a wi&s;h, that capital puni&s;hments were confined to crimes
of violence. In e&s;timating al&s;o the comparative malig|nancy
of which, regard is to be had, not only to the pro|per
or intended mi&s;chief of the crime, but to the alarm
occa&s;ioned by the attack, to the probability of &s;till wor&s;e
con&s;equences, and to the general con&s;ternation excited by
it in others. Thus in affixing the puni&s;hment of burglary,
or of breaking into dwelling-hou&s;es by night, we are to con|&s;ider
not only the peril to which the mo&s;t valuable property
is expo&s;ed by this crime, and which may be called the direct
and meditated mi&s;chief of it, but the danger of murder, in
ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, or for the &s;ake of preventing di&s;covery,
<PB N="538" REF="578">
and the univer&s;al dread with which the &s;ilent and de|fencele&s;s
hours of re&s;t and &s;leep mu&s;t be di&s;turbed, where
attempts of this &s;ort become frequent; and which dread
alone, and without the mi&s;chief which is the object of
it, is not only a public evil, but almo&s;t of all evils the
mo&s;t in&s;upportable. The&s;e circum&s;tances place a differ|ence
between the breaking into a dwelling-hou&s;e by day,
or by night; which difference obtains in the puni&s;h|ment
of the offence by the law of Mo&s;es, and is proba|bly
to be found in the judicial codes of mo&s;t countries,
from the earlie&s;t ages to the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Of frauds, or of injuries which are effected with|out
force, the mo&s;t noxious kinds are forgeries, coun|terfeiting
or dimini&s;hing of the coin, and the &s;tealing
of letters in the cour&s;e of their conveyance; ina&s;|much
as the&s;e practices tend to deprive the public
of accommodations, which not only improve the con|veniencies
of &s;ocial life, but are e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;peri|ty,
or even the exi&s;tence of commerce. Of the&s;e crimes
it may be &s;aid, that, although they &s;eem to affect property
alone, the mi&s;chief of their operation does not terminate
there. For let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the remi&s;sne&s;s or
lenity of the laws &s;hould, in any country, &s;uffer offences
of this &s;ort to grow into &s;uch a frequency, as to render
the u&s;e of money; the circulation of bills, or the public con|veyance
of letters no longer &s;afe or practicable; what would
follow, but that every &s;pecies of trade and of activity mu&s;t
decline under the&s;e di&s;couragements; the &s;ources of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence
fail, by which the inhabitants of the country are &s;upport|ed;
<PB N="539" REF="579">
the country it&s;elf, where the intercour&s;e of civil life was
&s;o endangered and defective, be de&s;erted; and that, be&s;ide
the di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, which the lo&s;s of employment
would produce to the indu&s;trious and valuable part of the
community, a rapid depopulation mu&s;t take place, each
generation becoming le&s;s numerous than the la&s;t, till &s;o|litude
and barrenne&s;s over&s;pread the land; until a de&s;ola|tion
&s;imilar to what obtains in many countries of A&s;ia,
which were once the mo&s;t civilized and frequented parts
of the world, &s;ucceed in the place of crouded cities,
cultivated fields, of happy and well peopled regions.
When we carry forwards therefore our views to the more
di&s;tant, but not le&s;s certain con&s;equences of the&s;e crimes,
we perceive that, though no living creature be de&s;troyed by
them, yet human life is dimini&s;hed; that an offence, the
particular con&s;equence of which deprives only an indivi|dual
of a &s;mall portion of his property, and which even in
its general tendency &s;eems only to ob&s;truct: the enjoy|ment
of certain public conveniences, may neverthele&s;s, by
its ultimate effects, conclude in the laying wa&s;te of human
exi&s;tence. This ob&s;ervation will enable tho&s;e, who regard
the divine rule of &startq;life for life and blood for blood&endq; as
the only authorized and ju&s;tifiable mea&s;ure of capital pun|i&s;hment,
to perceive a greater resemblance than they &s;up|po&s;ed,
with re&s;pect to the effects and quality of the actions,
between certain atrocious frauds, and the&s;e crimes which
attack per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of forgeries there appears a &s;ub&s;tantial dif|ference,
between the forging of bills of exchange, or of &s;e|curities
which are circulated, and the circulation and cur|rency
<PB N="540" REF="580">
of which are found to &s;erve and facilitate valuable
purpo&s;es of commerce, and the forging of bonds, lea&s;es,
mortgages, or of in&s;truments which are not commonly
transferred from one hand to another; becau&s;e, in the
former ca&s;e credit is nece&s;&s;arily given to the &s;ignature, and,
without that credit, the negociation of &s;uch property could
not be carried on, nor the public utility &s;ought from it be
attained; in the other ca&s;e, all po&s;&s;ibility of deceit might
be precluded, by a direct communication between the par|ties,
or by due care in the choice of their agents, with
little interruption to bu&s;ine&s;s, and without de&s;troying, or
much incumbering, the u&s;es for which the&s;e in&s;truments
are calculated. This di&s;tinction, I apprehend, to be not
only real, but preci&s;e enough to afford a line of divi&s;ion
between forgeries, which, as the law now &s;tands, are al|mo&s;t
univer&s;ally capital, and puni&s;hed with undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing
&s;everity.</P>
<P>Perjury is another crime of the &s;ame cla&s;s and magni|tude.
And, when we con&s;ider what reliance is nece&s;&s;arily
placed upon oaths; that all judicial deci&s;ions proceed upon
te&s;timony; that con&s;equently, there is not a right, which
a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, that fal&s;e witrie&s;&s;es may not deprive him
of; that reputation, property, and life it&s;elf lie open to
the attempts of perjury; that it may often be committed
without a po&s;&s;ibility of contradiction or di&s;covery; that
the &s;ucce&s;s and prevalency of this vice tend to introduce
the mo&s;t grievous and fatal inju&s;tice into the admini&s;tra|tion
of human affairs, or &s;uch a di&s;tru&s;t of te&s;timony as
mu&s;t create univer&s;al confu&s;ion and embarra&s;&s;ment; when
<PB N="541" REF="581">
we reflect upon the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, we &s;hall be brought, pro|bably,
to agree with the opinion of tho&s;e, who contend
that perjury, in its puni&s;hment, especially that which is
attempted in &s;olemn evidence, and in the face of a court
of ju&s;tice, &s;hould be placed on a level with the mo&s;t flagi|tious
frauds.</P>
<P>The obtaining of money by &s;ecret threats, whether we
regard the difficulty with which the crime is traced out,
the odious imputations to which it may lead, or the pro|fligate
con&s;piracies that are &s;ometimes formed to carry it
into execution, de&s;erves to be reckoned among&s;t the wor&s;t
&s;pecies of robbery.</P>
<P>The frequency of capital executions in this country,
owes its nece&s;&s;ity to three cau&s;es&mdash;much liberty, great
cities, and the want of a puni&s;hment, &s;hort of death, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
a &s;ufficient degree of terror. And if the taking a|way
of the life of malefactors be more rare in other coun|tries
than in ours, the rea&s;on will be &s;ound in &s;ome differ|ence
in the&s;e articles. The liberties of a free people, and
&s;till more the jealou&s;y with which the&s;e liberties are
watched, and by which they are maintained, permit not
tho&s;e precautions and re&s;traints, that inspection, &s;crutiny,
and control, which are exerci&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in arbitrary
governments. For example, the &s;pirit of the laws, and of
the people, will not &s;uffer the detention or con&s;inement
of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, without proofs of their guilt which
it is often impo&s;&s;ible to obtain; nor that ma&s;ters of fami|lies
be obliged to record and render up a de&s;cription
<PB N="542" REF="582">
of the &s;trangers or inmates they entertain; nor that an
account be demanded, at the plea&s;ure of the magi&s;trate,
of each man's time, employment, and means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence;
nor &s;ecurities to be required when the&s;e accounts
appear un&s;atisfactory or dubious; nor men to be appre|hended
upon the mere &s;ugge&s;tion of idlene&s;s or vagrancy;
nor to be confined to certain di&s;tricts; nor the inhabitants
of each di&s;trict to be made re&s;pon&s;ible for one another's behavi|our;
nor pa&s;sports to be exacted from all per&s;ons entering
or leaving the kingdom: lea&s;t of all will they tolerate the
appearance of an armed force, or of military law; or &s;uffer
the &s;treets and public roads to be guarded and patrol|led
by &s;oldiers; or, la&s;tly, entru&s;t the police with &s;uch
di&s;cretionary powers, as may make &s;ure of the guilty,
however they involve the innocent. The&s;e expedients,
although arbitrary and rigorous, are many of them effec|tual;
and in proportion as they render the commi&s;&s;ion or
concealment of crimes more difficult, they &s;ub&s;tract from
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;evere puni&s;hment. Great cities multiply
crimes by pre&s;enting ea&s;ier opportunities and more incen|tives
to libertini&s;m, which in low life is commonly the in|troductory
&s;tage to other enormities; by collecting thieves
and robbers into the &s;ame neighbourhood, which enables
them to form communications and confederacies, that
increa&s;e their art and courage, as well as &s;trength and
wickedne&s;s; but principally by the refuge they afford to
villany, in the means of concealment, and of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
in &s;ecrecy, which crouded towns &s;upply to men of every
de&s;cription. The&s;e temptations and facilities can only be
<PB N="543" REF="583">
counteracted by adding to the number of capital puni&s;h|ments.
But a third cau&s;e, which increa&s;es the frequency
of capital executions in England, is a defect of the laws in
not being provided with any other puni&s;hment than that
of death, &s;ufficiently terrible to keep offenders in awe.
Tran&s;portation, which is the &s;entence &s;econd in the order
of &s;everity, appears to me to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of example
very imperfectly; not only becau&s;e exile is in reality a
&s;light puni&s;hment to tho&s;e, who have neither property,
nor friends, nor reputation, nor regular means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence
at home; and becau&s;e their &s;ituation becomes little
wor&s;e by their crime, than it was before they committed
it; but becau&s;e the puni&s;hment, whatever it be, is unob|&s;erved
and unknown. A tran&s;ported convict may &s;uffer
under his &s;entence, but his &s;ufferings are removed from
the view of his countrymen; his mi&s;ery is un&s;een; his con|dition
&s;trikes no terror into the minds of tho&s;e, for who&s;e
warning and admonition it was intended. This cha&s;m
in the &s;cale of puni&s;hment produces al&s;o two farther im|perfections
in the admini&s;tration of penal ju&s;tice: the fir&s;t
is, that the &s;ame puni&s;hment is extended to crimes of very
different character and malignancy; the &s;econd, that pun|i&s;hments
&s;eparated by a great interval, are a&s;&s;igned to
crimes hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable in their guilt and mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The end of puni&s;hment is two-fold, <HI>amendment</HI> and <HI>ex|ample.</HI>
In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the <HI>reformation</HI> of criminals,
little has ever been effected, and little I fear is practicable.
From every &s;pecies of puni&s;hment that has hitherto been
<PB N="544" REF="584">
from $word$ and exile, from pain and infamy, male|factors
return more hardened in their crimes, and more
in&s;tructed. If there be any thing that &s;hakes the &s;oul of a
confirmed villain, it is the expectation of approaching
death. The horrors of this &s;ituation may cau&s;e &s;uch a
wrench in the mental organs, as to give them a holding
turn: and I think it probable, that many of tho&s;e who
are executed, would, if they were delivered at the point
of death, retain &s;uch a remembrance of their &s;en&s;ations,
as might pre&s;erve them, unle&s;s urged by extreme want,
from relap&s;ing into their former crimes. But this is an
experiment that from its nature cannot be repeated often.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>reforming</HI> puni&s;hments which have not yet been
tried, none promi&s;es &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s as that of <HI>&s;olitary</HI>
imprisonment, or the confinement of criminals in &s;eparate
apartments. This improvement would augment the ter|ror
of the puni&s;hment; &s;eclude the criminal from the &s;o|ciety
of his fellow pri&s;oners, in which &s;ociety the wor&s;e
are &s;ure to corrupt the better; would wean him from the
knowledge of his companions, and the love of that turbu|lent,
precarious life, in which his vices had engaged him;
would rai&s;e up in him reflections on the folly of his choice,
and di&s;po&s;e his mind to &s;uch better and continued peni|tence,
as might produce a la&s;ting alteration in the princi|ples
of his conduct.</P>
<P>As aver&s;ion to labour is the cau&s;e, from which half of
the vices of low life deduce their origin and continuance,
<PB N="545" REF="585">
puni&s;hments ought to be contrived with a view to the
conquering of this di&s;po&s;ition. Two oppo&s;ite expedients
have been recommended for this purpo&s;e; the one &s;olitary
confinement, with hard labour; the other &s;olitary con|finement,
with nothing to do. Both expedients &s;eek the
&s;ame end&mdash;to reconcile the idle to a life of indu&s;try.
The former hopes to effect this, by making labour habi|tual;
the latter, by making idlene&s;s irk&s;ome and in&s;up|portable:
and the preference of one method to the other,
depends upon the que&s;tion, whether a man is more likely
to betake him&s;elf, of his own accord, to work, who has
been accu&s;tomed to employment, or, who has been di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
by the want of it. When jails are once provided
for the <HI>&s;eparate</HI> confinement of pri&s;oners, which both propo|&s;als
require, the choice between them may be &s;oon deter|mined
by experience. If labour be exacted, I would leave
the whole or a portion of the profit to the pri&s;oner's u&s;e,
and I would debar him from any other provi&s;ion or &s;upply;
that his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, however coar&s;e or penurious, may be
proportioned to his diligence, and that he may ta&s;te the advan|tage
of indu&s;try, together with the fatigue. I would go far|ther;
I would mea&s;ure the confinement, not by duration of
time, but by quantity of work, in order both to excite
indu&s;try, and to render it more voluntary. But the prin|cipal
difficulty remains &s;till; namely, how to di&s;po&s;e of
criminals after their enlargement. By a rule of life, which
is perhaps too invariably and indi&s;criminately adhered to,
no one will receive a man or woman out of a jail, into
any &s;ervice or employment whatever. This is the com|mon
<PB N="546" REF="586">
misfortune of public puni&s;hments, that they preclude
the offender from all hone&s;t means of future, &s;upport.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Until this inconveniency be remedied, &s;mall offences had, perhaps, better go unpuni&s;hed; I do not mean that the laws &s;hould exempt them from puni&s;hment, but that private per&s;ons &s;hould be tender in pro&s;ecuting them.</NOTE> It
&s;eems therefore incumbent upon the &s;tate to &s;ecure a
maintenance to tho&s;e who are willing to work for it; and
yet it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to divide criminals as far
a&s;under from one another as po&s;&s;ible. Whether male pri|&s;oners
might not, after the term of their confinement was
expired, be di&s;tributed in the country, detained within
certain limits, and employed upon the public roads; and
females be remitted to the over&s;eers of country pari&s;hes,
to be there furni&s;hed with dwellings, and with the mate|rials
and implements of occupation; whether by the&s;e,
or by what other methods, it may be po&s;&s;ible to effect the
two purpo&s;es of <HI>employment</HI> and <HI>di&s;per&s;ion,</HI> well merits the
attention of all, who are anxious to perfect the internal
regulation of their country.</P>
<P><HI>Torture</HI> is applied, either to obtain confe&s;&s;ions of guilt,
or to exa&s;perate or prolong the pains of death. No
bodily puni&s;hment, however excruciating or long conti|nued,
receives the name of torture, unle&s;s it be de&s;igned
to kill the criminal by a more lingering death, or to ex|tort
from him the di&s;covery of &s;ome &s;ecret, which is
&s;uppo&s;ed to lie concealed in his brea&s;t;. <HI>The que&s;tion by
<PB N="547" REF="587">
torture</HI> appears to be equivocal in its effects; for, as extre|mity
of pain, and not any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of remor&s;e
in the mind, produces tho&s;e effects, an innocent man
may &s;ink under the torment, as &s;oon as the guilty.
The latter has as much rea&s;on for his re&s;olution, and as
much to fear from yielding, as the former. The in&s;tant
and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table de&s;ire of relief may draw from one
&s;ufferer fal&s;e accu&s;ations of him&s;elf or others, as it may
&s;ometimes extract the truth out of another. This ambi|guity
renders the u&s;e of torture, as a means of procuring
information in criminal proceedings, liable to the ri&s;k of
grievous and irreparable inju&s;tice. For which rea&s;on,
though recommended by ancient and general example, it
has been properly exploded from the mild and cautious
&s;y&s;tem of penal juri&s;prudence, e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country.</P>
<P>Barbarous &s;pectacles of human agony are ju&s;tly found
fault with, as tending to harden and deprave the pub|lic
feelings, and to de&s;troy that &s;ympathy with which
the &s;ufferings of our fellow creatures are beheld; or, if
no effect of this kind follow from them; they counteract
in &s;ome mea&s;ure their own de&s;ign, by &s;inking men's ab|horrence
of the crime in their commi&s;eration of the cri|minal.
But if a mode of execution could be devi&s;ed,
which would augment the horror of the puni&s;hment, with|out
offending or impairing the public &s;en&s;ibility by cruel
or un&s;eemly exhibitions of death, it might add &s;omething
to the efficacy of the example; and by being re&s;erved for a
few atrocious crimes, might al&s;o enlarge the &s;cale of pun|i&s;hment;
an addition to which &s;eems wanting; for, as the
<PB N="548" REF="588">
matter remains at pre&s;ent, you hang a malefactor for a
&s;imple robbery, and can do no more to the villain who
has poi&s;oned his father. Somewhat of the &s;ort we have
been de&s;cribing was the propo&s;al, not long &s;ince &s;ugge&s;ted,
of ca&s;ting murderers into a den of wild bea&s;ts, where they
would peri&s;h in a manner dreadful to the imagination,
yet concealed from, the view.</P>
<P><HI>Infamous</HI> puni&s;hments are mi&s;managed in this country,
with re&s;pect both to the crimes and the criminals. In the
fir&s;t place, they ought to be confined to offences, which
are held in undi&s;puted and univer&s;al dete&s;tation. To
condemn to the pillory the author or editor of a libel
again&s;t the &s;tate, who has rendered him&s;elf the favourite
of a party, if not of the people, by the very act for which
he &s;tands there, is to gratify the offender, and to expo&s;e
the laws to mockery and in&s;ult. In the &s;econd place, the
delinquents who receive this &s;entence, are for the mo&s;t
part &s;uch, as have long cea&s;ed, either to value reputation,
or to fear &s;hame; of who&s;e happine&s;s and of who&s;e en|joyments
character makes no part. Thus the low mini&s;|ters
of libertini&s;m, the keepers of bawdy or di&s;orderly
hou&s;es, are threatened in vain with a puni&s;hment, that
affects a &s;en&s;e which they have not; that applies &s;olely to
the imagination, to the virtue and the pride of human
nature. The pillory, or any other infamous di&s;tinc|tion
might be employed rightly, and with effect, in
the puni&s;hment of &s;ome offences of higher life; as of
frauds and peculation in office; of collu&s;ions and conni|vances,
<PB N="549" REF="589">
by which the public trea&s;ury is defrauded; of
breaches of tru&s;t; of perjury, and &s;ubornation of perjury;
of the <HI>clande&s;tine</HI> and forbidden &s;ale of places; of flagrant
abu&s;es of authority, or neglect of duty; and la&s;tly, of cor|ruption
in the exerci&s;e of confidential, or judicial offices. In
all which the more elevated was the &s;tation of the crimi|nal,
the more &s;ignal and con&s;picuous would be the triumph
of ju&s;tice, and the more efficacious the example.</P>
<P>The <HI>certainty</HI> of puni&s;hment is of more con&s;equence
than the &s;everity. Criminals do not &s;o much flatter
them&s;elves with the lenity of the &s;entence, as with the
hope of e&s;caping. They are not &s;o apt to compare what
they gain by the crime, with what they may &s;uffer
from the puni&s;hment, as to encourage them&s;elves with the
chance of concealment or flight. For which rea&s;on, a
vigilant magi&s;tracy, an accurate police, a proper di&s;tribu|tion
of force and intelligence, together with due rewards
for the di&s;covery and apprehen&s;ion of malefactors, and
an undeviating impartiality in carrying the laws into exe|cution,
contribute more to the re&s;traint and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
crimes, than any violent exacerbations of puni&s;hment.
And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, of all contrivances directed
to this end, tho&s;e, perhaps, are mo&s;t effectual, which
facilitate the conviction of criminals. The offence
of counterfeiting the coin, could not be checked
by all the terrors and the utmo&s;t &s;everity of law,
whil&s;t the act of coining was nece&s;&s;ary to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
<PB N="550" REF="590">
by &s;pecific proof. The &s;tatute which made the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the implements of coining capital, that is, which con&s;ti|tuted
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion complete evidence of the offender's
guilt, was the fir&s;t thing that gave force and efficacy
to the denunciations of law upon this &s;ubject. The
&s;tatute of James the Fir&s;t, relative to the murder
of ba&s;tard children, which ordains that the concealment
of the birth &s;hould be deemed inconte&s;tible proof of the
charge, though a har&s;h law, was, in like manner with the
former, well calculated to put a &s;top to the crime.</P>
<P>It is upon the principle of this ob&s;ervation, that
I apprehend much harm to have been done to the
community, by the over-&s;trained &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s, or
weak timidity of juries, which demands often &s;uch
proof of a pri&s;oner's guilt, as the nature and &s;ecrecy
of his crime &s;carce po&s;&s;ibly admit of; and which holds it
the part of a <HI>&s;afe</HI> conscience not to condemn any man,
whil&s;t there exi&s;ts the minute&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of his inno|cence.
Any &s;tory they may happen to have heard or read
whether real or feigned in which courts of ju&s;tice have
been mi&s;led by pre&s;umptions of guilt, is enough, in their
minds, to found an acquittal upon, where po&s;itive proof is
wanting. I do not mean that juries &s;hould indulge con|jectures,
magnify &s;u&s;picions into proofs, or even that
they &s;hould weigh probabilities in <HI>gold &s;cales;</HI> but when
the preponderation of evidence is &s;o manife&s;t, as to per|&s;uade
every private under&s;tanding of the pri&s;oner's guilt,
when it furni&s;hes that degree of credibility, upon which
men decide and act in all other doubts, and which ex|perience
<PB N="551" REF="591">
hath &s;hown that they may decide and act upon
with &s;ufficient &s;afety; to reject &s;uch proof, from an in&s;inua|tion
of uncertainty that belongs to all human affairs, and a
general dread, left the charge of innocent blood &s;hould lie at
their doors, is a conduct, which, however natural to a
mind &s;tudious of its own quiet, is authori&s;ed by no con|&s;iderations
of rectitude or utility. It counteracts the
care, and damps the activity of government: it holds out
public encouragement to villainy, by confe&s;&s;ing the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of bringing villains to ju&s;tice; and that &s;pecies
of encouragement, which, as hath been ju&s;t now ob|&s;erved,
the minds of &s;uch men are mo&s;t apt to entertain
and dwell upon.</P>
<P>There are two popular maxims, which &s;eem to have a
con&s;iderable influence, in producing the injudicious ac|quittals
of which we have been complaining. One is, &startq;that
circum&s;tantial evidence falls &s;hort of po&s;itive proof.&endq;
This a&s;&s;ertion, in the unqualified &s;en&s;e in which it is ap|plied,
is not true. A concurrence of well-authenticated
circum&s;tances compo&s;es a &s;tronger ground of a&s;&s;urance,
than po&s;itive te&s;timony, unconfirmed by circum&s;tances,
u&s;ually affords. Circum&s;tances cannot lie. The conclu|sion
al&s;o, which re&s;ults from them, though deduced by
only probable inference, is commonly more to be relied
upon, than the veracity of an un&s;upported &s;olitary wit|ne&s;s.
The danger of being deceived is le&s;s; the actual
in&s;tances of deception are fewer in the one ca&s;e than the
other. What is called po&s;itive proof in criminal matters,
<PB N="552" REF="592">
as where a man &s;wears to the per&s;on of the pri&s;oner, and
that he actually &s;aw him commit the crime with which
he is charged, may be founded in the mi&s;take or perjury
of a &s;ingle witne&s;s. Such mi&s;takes, and &s;uch perjuries,
are not without many examples. Whereas, to impo&s;e
upon a court of ju&s;tice a chain of <HI>circum&s;tantial</HI> evidence
in &s;upport of a fabricated accu&s;ation, requires &s;uch a number
of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es as &s;eldom meet together; an union al&s;o of
&s;kill and wickedne&s;s, which is &s;till more rare; and after all,
this &s;pecies of proof lies much more open to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,
and is more likely, if fal&s;e, to be contradicted, or to be|tray
it&s;elf by &s;ome unfore&s;een incon&s;i&s;tency, than that
direct proof, which being confined within the know|ledge
of a &s;ingle per&s;on, which appealing to, or &s;tanding
connected with no external or collateral circum&s;tances, is
incapable, by its very &s;implicity, of being confronted
with oppo&s;ite probabilities.</P>
<P>The other maxim which de&s;erves a &s;imilar examination
is this, &startq;that it is better that ten guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape,
than that one innocent man &s;hould &s;uffer.&endq; If by &s;aying
it is <HI>better,</HI> be meant that it is more for the public advan|tage,
the propo&s;ition, I think, cannot be maintained. The
&s;ecurity of civil life, which is e&s;&s;ential to the value and the
enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing it contains, and the interrup|tion
of which is followed by univer&s;al mi&s;ery and confu|&s;ion,
is protected chiefly by the dread of puni&s;hment.
The misfortune of an individual, for &s;uch may the &s;uffer|ings,
<PB N="553" REF="593">
or even the death of an innocent per&s;on be called,
when they are occa&s;ioned by no evil intention, cannot be
placed in competition with this object. I do not contend
that the life or &s;afety of the meane&s;t &s;ubject ought, in
any ca&s;e, to be knowingly &s;acrificed. No principle of ju|dicature,
no end of puni&s;hment can ever require <HI>that.</HI>
But when certain rules of adjudication mu&s;t be pur&s;ued,
when certain degrees of credibility mu&s;t be accepted, in
order to reach the crimes with which the public are in|fe&s;ted;
courts of ju&s;tice &s;hould not be deterred from the
application of the&s;e rules, by <HI>every</HI> &s;u&s;picion of danger, or
by the mere po&s;&s;ibility of confounding the innocent with
the guilty. They ought rather to reflect, that he, who falls
by a mi&s;taken &s;entence, may be con&s;idered as falling for
his country; whil&s;t he &s;uffers under the operation of the&s;e
rules, by the general effect and tendency of which, the
welfare of the community is maintained and upheld.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Religious E&s;tabli&s;hments, and of Toleration.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;A Religious e&s;tabli&s;hment is no part of Chri&s;tianity,
it is only the means of inculcating it.&endq;&mdash;It can|not
be proved that any form of church government was
laid down in &s;cripture with a view of fixing a con&s;titution
for &s;ucceeding ages; and which con&s;titution, con&s;e|quently,
the di&s;ciples of chri&s;tianity would, every where,
and at all times, by the very law of their religion, be
obliged to adopt. Certainly no command for this purpo&s;e
was delivered by Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and if it may be &s;hown
that the apo&s;tles ordained bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters among&s;t
their fir&s;t converts, it mu&s;t be remembered that deacons
al&s;o and deacone&s;&s;es were appointed by the &s;ame autho|rity,
with functions very di&s;&s;imilar to any which obtain
in the church at pre&s;ent. The truth &s;eems to have been,
<PB N="555" REF="595">
that &s;uch offices were at fir&s;t erected in the Chri&s;tian
church, as the good order, the in&s;truction and the exi|gences
of the &s;ociety at that time required, without any
intention, at lea&s;t without any declared de&s;ign, of regu|lating
the appointment, authority, or the di&s;tinction of
Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters under future circum&s;tances. This
re&s;erve, if we may &s;o call it, in the Chri&s;tian Legi&s;lator,
is &s;ufficiently accounted for by two con&s;iderations: Fir&s;t,
that no preci&s;e con&s;titution could be framed, which would
&s;uit with the condition of Chri&s;tianity in its primitive &s;tate,
and with that which it was to a&s;&s;ume when it &s;hould be
advanced into a national religion. Secondly, that a par|ticular
de&s;ignation of office or authority among&s;t the
mini&s;ters of the new religion, might have &s;o interfered
with the arrangements of civil policy, as to have formed,
in &s;ome countries, a con&s;iderable ob&s;tacle to the progre&s;s
and reception of the religion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The authority therefore, of a church e&s;tabli&s;hment is
founded in its utility: and whenever, upon this principle,
we deliberate concerning the form, propriety, or compara|tive
excellency of different e&s;tabli&s;hments, the &s;ingle
view under which we ought to con&s;ider any of them is
that of &startq;a &s;cheme of in&s;truction;&endq; the &s;ingle end we
ought to propo&s;e by them is, &startq;the pre&s;ervation and
communication of religious knowledge.&endq; Every other
idea, and every other end that have been mixed with this,
as the making of the church an engine, or even <HI>an ally</HI>
of the &s;tate; converting it into the means of &s;trengthen|ing
<PB N="556" REF="596">
or of diffu&s;ing influence; or regarding it as a &s;upport of
regal in oppo&s;ition to popular forms of government, have
&s;erved only to deba&s;e the in&s;titution, and to introduce
into it many corruptions and abu&s;es.</P>
<P>The notion of a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment comprehends
three things;&mdash;a clergy, or an order of men &s;ecluded
from other profe&s;&s;ions to attend upon the offices of reli|gion;&mdash;a
legal provi&s;ion for the maintenance of the
clergy;&mdash;and the confining of that provi&s;ion to the teachers
of a particular &s;ect of Chri&s;tianity. If any one of the&s;e
three things be wanting; if there be no clergy, as
among&s;t the quakers; or, if the clergy have no other
provi&s;ion than what they derive from the voluntary con|tribution
of their hearers; or, if the provi&s;ion which the
laws a&s;&s;ign to the &s;upport of religion be extended to va|rious
&s;ects and denominations of Chri&s;tians, there exi&s;ts
no national religion or e&s;tabli&s;hed church, according to
the &s;en&s;e which the&s;e terms are u&s;ually made to convey.
He, therefore, who would defend eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ments,
mu&s;t &s;how the &s;eparate utility of the&s;e three
e&s;&s;ential parts of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>1. The que&s;tion fir&s;t in order upon the &s;ubject, as well
as the mo&s;t fundamental in its importance, is, whether
the knowledge and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity can be main|tained
in a country, without a cla&s;s of men &s;et apart by
public authority to the &s;tudy and teaching of religion,
and to the conducting of public wor&s;hip; and for tho&s;e
<PB N="557" REF="597">
purpo&s;es &s;ecluded from other employments. I add this
la&s;t circum&s;tance, becau&s;e in it con&s;i&s;ts, as I take it, the
&s;ub&s;tance of the que&s;tion. Now it mu&s;t be remembered
that Chri&s;tianity is an hi&s;torical religion, founded in facts
which are related to have pa&s;&s;ed, upon di&s;cour&s;es which
were held, and letters which were written, in a remote
age and di&s;tant country of the world, as well as under a
&s;tate of life and manners, and during the prevalency of
opinions, cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions, very unlike any
which are found among&s;t mankind at pre&s;ent. Moreover
this religion, having been fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the country
of Judea, and being built upon the more ancient religion
of the Jews, is nece&s;&s;arily and intimately connected with
the &s;acred writings, with the hi&s;tory and polity of that
&s;ingular people; to which mu&s;t be added, that the records
of both revelations are pre&s;erved in languages which
have long cea&s;ed to be &s;poken in any part of the world.
Books which come down to us from times &s;o remote, and
under &s;o many cau&s;es of unavoidable ob&s;curity, cannot,
it is evident, be under&s;tood without &s;tudy and preparation.
The languages mu&s;t be learnt. The various writings
which the&s;e volumes contain, mu&s;t be carefully com|pared
with one another, and with them&s;elves. What
remains of cotemporary authors, or of authors con|nected
with the age, the country, or the &s;ubject of our
&s;criptures, mu&s;t be peru&s;ed and con&s;ulted, in order to
interpret doubtful forms of &s;peech, and to explain allu|&s;ions
which refer to object or u&s;ages that no longer exi&s;t.
Above all, the modes of expre&s;&s;ion, the habits of rea&s;on|ing
<PB N="558" REF="598">
and argumentation, which were then in u&s;e, and to
which the di&s;cour&s;es even of in&s;pired teachers were ne|ce&s;&s;arily
adapted, mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently known, and can
only be known at all, by a due acquaintance with ancient
literature. And, la&s;tly, to e&s;tabli&s;h the genuinene&s;s and
integrity of the canonical &s;criptures them&s;elves, a &s;eries
of te&s;timony recognizing the notoriety and reception of
the&s;e books, mu&s;t be deduced from times near to tho&s;e
of their fir&s;t publication, down the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages
through which they have been tran&s;mitted to us. The
qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch re&s;earches demand, it is
confe&s;&s;ed, a degree of lei&s;ure, and a kind of education,
incon&s;i&s;tent with the exerci&s;e of any other profe&s;&s;ion;
but how few are there among&s;t the clergy, from whom
any thing of this &s;ort can be expected! How &s;mall a
proportion of their number, who &s;eem likely either to
augment the fund of &s;acred literature, or even to collect
what is already known!&mdash;To this objection it may be
replied, that we &s;ow many &s;eeds to rai&s;e one flower.&mdash;In
order to produce a <HI>few</HI> capable of improving and continu|ing
the &s;tock of Chri&s;tian erudition, lei&s;ure and opport|unity
mu&s;t be afforded to great numbers. Original
knowledge of this kind can never be univer&s;al; but it is
of the utmo&s;t importance, and it is enough, that there
be, at all times, found <HI>&s;ome</HI> qualified, for &s;uch enquiries,
and in who&s;e concurring and independent conclu|&s;ions
upon each &s;ubject, the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian com|munity
may &s;afely confide: whereas without an order of
clergy educated for the purpo&s;e, and led to the pro&s;ecu|tion
<PB N="559" REF="599">
of the&s;e &s;tudies by the habits, the lei&s;ure and the
object of their vocation, it may well be questioned whe|ther
the learning it&s;elf would not have been lo&s;t, by
which the records of our faith are interpreted and de|fended.
We contend, therefore, that an order of clergy
is nece&s;&s;ary to perpetuate the evidences of revelation, and
to interpret the ob&s;curities of the&s;e ancient writings, in
which the religion is contained. But be&s;ides this, which
forms, no doubt, one de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, the
more ordinary offices of public teaching, and of con|ducting
public wor&s;hip, call for qualifications not u&s;ually to
be met with amid&s;t the employments of civil life. It has
been acknowledged by &s;ome, who cannot be &s;u&s;pected of
making unnece&s;&s;ary conce&s;&s;ions in favour of e&s;tabli&s;h|ments,
&startq;to be barely <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that a per&s;on who was never
educated for the office &s;hould acquit him&s;elf with decency
as a public teacher of religion:&endq; And that &s;urely mu&s;t be
a very defective policy, which tru&s;ts to <HI>po&s;&s;ibilities</HI> for &s;uc|ce&s;s,
when provi&s;ion is to be made for regular and general
in&s;truction. Little objection to this argument can be
drawn from the example of the quakers, who it may be
&s;aid, furni&s;h an experimental proof that the wor&s;hip and
profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity may be upheld without a &s;eparate
clergy. The&s;e &s;ectaries every where &s;ub&s;i&s;t in conjunction
with a regular e&s;tabli&s;hment. They have acce&s;s to the
writings, they profit by the labours of the clergy, in
common with other Chri&s;tians. They participate in that
general diffu&s;ion of religious knowledge, which the con&s;tant
teaching of a more regular mini&s;try keeps up in the country:
<PB N="560" REF="600">
with &s;uch aids, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the de|defects
of a plan may not be much felt, although the
plan it&s;elf be altogether unfit for general imitation.</P>
<P>2. If then an order of clergy be nece&s;&s;ary, if it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
al&s;o to &s;eclude them from the employments and
profits of other profe&s;&s;ions, it is evident they ought to be
enabled to derive a maintenance from their own. Now this
maintenance mu&s;t either depend upon the voluntary con|tributions
of their hearers, or ari&s;e from revenues a&s;&s;igned
by authority of law. To the &s;cheme of voluntary con|tribution
there exi&s;ts this in&s;urmountable objection, that
few would ultimately contribute any thing at all. How|ever
the zeal of a &s;ect, or the novelty of a change,
might &s;upport &s;uch an experiment for a while, no reliance
could be placed upon it as a general and permanent pro|vi&s;ion.
It is at all times a bad con&s;titution which; pre&s;ents
temptations of intere&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the duties of re|ligion;
or which makes the offices of religion, expen&s;ive
to tho&s;e who attend upon them; or which allows pre|&s;ences
of con&s;cience to be an excu&s;e for not &s;haring in a
public burthen. If, by declining to frequent religious
a&s;&s;emblies, men could &s;ave their money, at the &s;ame
time that they indulged their indolence, and their di&s;|inclination
to exerci&s;es of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reflection; or
if, by di&s;&s;enting from the national religion, they could
be excu&s;ed from contributing to the &s;upport of the mi|ni&s;ters
of religion, it is to be feared that many would
take advantage of the option which was thus imprudently
<PB N="561" REF="601">
left open to them, and that this liberty might finally
operate to the decay of virtue, and an irrecoverable for|getfulne&s;s
of all religion in the country. Is there not
too much rea&s;on to fear, that, if it were re&s;erred to the
di&s;cretion of each neighbourhood, whether they would
maintain among&s;t them a teacher of religion or not,
many di&s;tricts would remain unprovided with any?&mdash;that
with the difficulties which incumber every mea&s;ure,
requiring the co-operation of numbers, and where each
individual of the number has an intere&s;t &s;ecretly pleading
again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, a&s;&s;ociations for
the &s;upport of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip and in&s;truction would
neither be numerous nor long continued. The devout and
pious might lament in vain the want or the di&s;tance of a
religious a&s;&s;embly: they could not form nor maintain
one, without the concurrence of neighbours who felt
neither their zeal nor their liberality.</P>
<P>From the difficulty with which congregations would
be e&s;tabli&s;hed and upheld upon the <HI>voluntary</HI> plan, let us
carry our thoughts to the condition of tho&s;e who are to
officiate in them. Preaching in time would become a
mode of begging. With what &s;incerity, or with what
dignity, can a preacher di&s;pen&s;e the truths of Chri&s;tia|nity,
who&s;e thoughts are perpetually &s;olicited to the
reflection how he may increa&s;e his &s;ub&s;cription. His
eloquence, if he po&s;&s;e&s;s any, re&s;embles rather the exhi|bition
of a player who is computing the profits of his
theatre, than the &s;implicity of a man, who, feeling
<PB N="562" REF="602">
him&s;elf the awful expectations of religion, is &s;eeking to
bring others to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding of their
duty as may &s;ave their &s;ouls. Moreover, a little experi|ence
of the di&s;po&s;ition of the common people will inform
us, that it is one thing to edify them in Chri&s;tian know|ledge,
and another to gratify their ta&s;te for vehement
impa&s;&s;ioned oratory&mdash;that he, not only who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s but
who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends upon collecting and plea&s;ing a
croud, mu&s;t re&s;ort to other arts than the acquirement and
communication of &s;ober and profitable in&s;truction&mdash;to be
thus at the mercy of his audience, to be obliged to adapt
his doctrines to the plea&s;ure of a capricious multitude,
to be continually affecting a &s;tyle and manner of preach|ing
neither natural to him, nor agreeable to his judg|ment,
to live in con&s;tant bondage to tyrannical and
in&s;olent directors, are circum&s;tances &s;o mortifying, not
only to the pride of the human heart, but to the virtuous
love of independency, that they are rarely &s;ubmitted to
without a &s;acrifice of principle, and a depravation of cha|racter&mdash;at
lea&s;t it may be pronounced, that a mini&s;try,
&s;o degraded, would &s;oon fall into the lowe&s;t hands; for
it would be found impracticable to engage men of worth
and ability, in &s;o precarious and humiliating a profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If it be admitted then, in deference to the&s;e rea&s;ons,
that a legal provi&s;ion for the clergy, cornpul&s;ory upon
tho&s;e who contribute to it, is expedient; the next que&s;|tion
will be, whether this provi&s;ion &s;hould be confined to
one &s;ect of Chri&s;tianity, or be extended indifferently to
<PB N="563" REF="603">
all.&mdash;Now it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that this que&s;tion can
never offer it&s;elf where the people are agreed in their re|ligious
opinions, and that it never ought to ari&s;e, where
a &s;y&s;tem can be framed of doctrines and wor&s;hip wide
enough to comprehend their di&s;agreement: and which
may &s;atisfy all by uniting all in the articles of their com|mon
faith; and in a mode of divine wor&s;hip, omitting
every &s;ubject of controver&s;y or offence.&mdash;Where &s;uch a
comprehen&s;ion is practicable, the comprehending religion
ought to be made that of the &s;tate. But if this be de&s;|paired
of; if religious opinions exi&s;t, not only &s;o various,
but &s;o contradictory, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile
them to each other, or to any one confe&s;&s;ion of faith, rule
of di&s;cipline, or form of wor&s;hip; if, con&s;equently,
&s;eparate congregations and different &s;ects mu&s;t unavoid|ably
continue in the country, under &s;uch circumstances
whether the laws ought to e&s;tabli&s;h one &s;ect in preference
to the re&s;t, that is, whether they ought to confer the
provi&s;ion a&s;&s;igned to the maintenance of religion upon
the teachers of one &s;y&s;tem of doctrines alone, becomes a
que&s;tion of nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and of great importance.
And whatever we may determine concerning &s;peculative
rights and ab&s;tract proprieties, when we &s;et about the
framing of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution adapted to real
life, and to the actual &s;tate of religion in the country,
we &s;hall find this que&s;tion very nearly related to, and
principally, indeed, dependent upon another; namely,
&startq;in what way or by whom ought the mini&s;ters of reli|gion
to be appointed?&endq; If the &s;pecies of patronage be
<PB N="564" REF="604">
retained to which we are accu&s;tomed in this country, and
which allows private individuals to nominate teachers of
religion for di&s;tricts and congregations to which they are
ab&s;olute &s;trangers, without &s;ome te&s;t propo&s;ed to the
per&s;ons nominated, the utmo&s;t di&s;cordancy of religious
opinions might frequently ari&s;e between the &s;everal
teachers and their re&s;pective congregations. A popi&s;h
patron might appoint a prie&s;t to &s;ay ma&s;s to a congrega|tion
of prote&s;tants; an epi&s;copal clergyman be &s;ent to
officiate in a pari&s;h of pre&s;byterians; or a pre&s;byterian
divine to inveigh again&s;t the errors of popery before an
audience of papi&s;ts. The requi&s;ition then of &s;ub&s;cription,
or any other te&s;t, by which the national religion is
guarded, may be con&s;idered as a re&s;triction upon the exer|ci&s;e
of private patronage. The laws &s;peak to the private
patron thus: &startq;Of tho&s;e whom we have previou&s;ly pronoun|ced
to be fitly qualified to teach religion, we allow you to
&s;elect one; but we do not allow you to decide what reli|gion
&s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a particular di&s;trict of the
country; for which deci&s;ion you are in no wi&s;e fitted by
any qualifications which, as a private patron, you may
happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. If it be nece&s;&s;ary that the point be de|termined
for the inhabitants by any other will than their
own, it is &s;urely better that it &s;hould be determined by
the deliberate re&s;olution of the legi&s;lature, than by the
ca&s;ual inclination of an individual, by whom the right is
purcha&s;ed, or to whom it devolves as a mere temporal in|heritance.&endq;
Where&s;oever, therefore, this con&s;titution of
patronage is adopted, a national religion, or the legal
<PB N="565" REF="605">
preference of one particular religion to all others,
mu&s;t almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily accompany it. Or, &s;econdly, if
it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the appointment of the mini&s;ter of
religion is left in each pari&s;h to the choice of the pari&s;h|ioners,
may not this choice be &s;afely exerci&s;ed without
its being limited to the teachers of any particular &s;ect?
The effect of &s;uch a liberty would be, that a papi&s;t, or
a pre&s;byterian, a methodi&s;t, a Moravian, or an anabapti&s;t
might &s;ucce&s;&s;ively gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pulpit according
as a majority of the party happened at each election to
prevail. Now with what violence the conflict would up|on
every vacancy be renewed; what bitter animo&s;ities
would be revived, or rather be con&s;tantly fed and kept
alive in the neighbourhood; with what unconquerable
aver&s;ion the teacher and his religion would be received by
the defeated party, may be fore&s;een by tho&s;e who reflect
with how much pa&s;&s;ion every di&s;pute is carried on, in
which the name of religion can be made to mix it&s;elf;
much more where the cau&s;e it&s;elf is concerned &s;o imme|diately
as it would be in this. Or, thirdly, if the &s;tate
appoint the mini&s;ters of religion, this con&s;titution will
differ little from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national religion;
for the &s;tate would, undoubtedly, appoint tho&s;e, and
tho&s;e alone, who&s;e religions opinions, or rather who&s;e
religious denomination agreed with their own: unle&s;s it
be thought that any thing would be gained to religious
liberty by transferring the choice of the national religion
from the legi&s;lature of the country to the magi&s;trate, who
admini&s;ters the executive government. The only plan
<PB N="566" REF="606">
which &s;eems to render the legal maintenance of a clergy
practicable, without the legal preference of one &s;ect of
Chri&s;tians to others, is that of an experiment which is
&s;aid to be attempted or de&s;igned in &s;ome of the new &s;tates
of North America. The nature of the plan is thus de|&s;cribed.
A tax is levied upon the inhabitants for the
general &s;upport of religion; the collector of the tax
goes round with a regi&s;ter in his hand, in which are in|&s;erted,
at the head of &s;o many di&s;tinct columns, the
names of the &s;everal religious &s;ects, that are profe&s;&s;ed in
the country.&mdash;The per&s;on, who is called upon for the
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, as &s;oon as he has paid his quota, &s;ub&s;cribes
his name in which of the columns he plea&s;es: and the
amount of what is collected in each column is paid over
to the mini&s;ter of that denomination. In this &s;cheme it
is not referred to the option of the &s;ubject, whether he
will contribute, or what he &s;hall contribute to the main|tenance
of a Chri&s;tian mini&s;try; it is only left to his
choice to determine by what &s;ect his contribution &s;hall
be received. The above arrangement is, undoubtedly,
the be&s;t that has been propo&s;ed upon this principle; it
bears the appearance of liberality and ju&s;tice, it may
contain &s;ome &s;olid advantages; neverthele&s;s it labours
under inconveniences which will be found, I think, upon
trial, to over-balance all its recommendations. It is
&s;carcely compatible with that, which is the fir&s;t requi&s;ite
in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, the divi&s;ion of the
country into pari&s;hes of a commodious extent. If the
pari&s;hes be &s;mall, and mini&s;ters of every denomination be
<PB N="567" REF="607">
&s;tationed in each, which the plan &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, the
expence of their maintenance would become too burthen|&s;ome
a charge for the country to &s;upport. If, to reduce
the expence, the di&s;tricts be enlarged, the place of a&s;&s;em|bling
would oftentimes be too far removed from the
re&s;idence of the per&s;ons who ought to re&s;ort to it. Again,
the making the pecuniary &s;ucce&s;s of the different teachers
of religion to depend upon the number and wealth of
their re&s;pective followers, would naturally generate
&s;trifes, and indecent jealou&s;ies among&s;t them, as well as
produce a polemical and pro&s;elyting &s;pirit, founded in
or mixed with views of private gain, which would both
deprave the principles of the clergy, and di&s;tract the
country with endle&s;s contentions.</P>
<P>The argument, then, by which eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tab|li&s;hments
are defended, proceeds by the&s;e &s;teps. The
knowledge and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity cannot be up|held
without a clergy; a clergy cannot be &s;upported
without a legal provi&s;ion; a legal provi&s;ion for the clergy
cannot be con&s;tituted without the preference of one &s;ect
of Chri&s;tians to the re&s;t: and the conclu&s;ion will be &s;atis|factory
in the degree in which the truth of the&s;e &s;everal
propo&s;itions has been made out.</P>
<P>If it be deemed expedient to e&s;tabli&s;h a national reli|gion,
that is to &s;ay, one &s;ect in preference to all others;
&s;ome te&s;t, by which the teachers of that &s;ect may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the teachers of different &s;ects,
<PB N="568" REF="608">
appears to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible con&s;equence. The exi&s;t|ence
of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;uppo&s;es it&mdash;the very no|tion
of a national religion includes that of a te&s;t. But
this nece&s;&s;ity, which is real, hath, according to the
fa&s;hion of human affairs, furni&s;hed to almo&s;t every church
a pretence for extending, multiplying and continuing
&s;uch te&s;ts beyond what the occa&s;ion ju&s;tified. For though
&s;ome purpo&s;es of order and tranquillity may be an&s;wered
by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of creeds and confe&s;&s;ions; yet they
are at all times attended with &s;erious inconveniences.
They check enquiry; they violate liberty; they en&s;nare
the con&s;ciences of the clergy by holding out temptations
to prevarication: however, they may expre&s;s the per&s;ua|&s;ion,
or be accommodated to the controver&s;ies or to the
fears of the age, in which they are compo&s;ed, in proce&s;s
of time, and by rea&s;on of the changes which are wont
to take place in the judgment of mankind upon religious
&s;ubjects, they come at length to contradict the actual
opinions of the church, who&s;e doctrines they profe&s;s to
contain; and they often perpetuate the pro&s;cription of
&s;ects and tenets, from which any danger has long cea&s;ed
to be apprehended.</P>
<P>It may not follow from the&s;e objections that te&s;ts and
&s;ub&s;criptions ought to be aboli&s;hed; but it follows that
they ought to be made as &s;imple and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible;
that they &s;hould be adapted from time to time to the
varying &s;entiments and circum&s;tances of the church in
which they are received; and that they &s;hould at no time
<PB N="569" REF="609">
advance one &s;tep farther than &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;ting nece&s;&s;ity
requires. If, for in&s;tance, promi&s;es of conformity to the
rites, liturgy and offices of the church, be &s;ufficient to
prevent confu&s;ion and di&s;order in the celebration of divine
wor&s;hip, then &s;uch promi&s;es ought to be accepted in the
place of &s;tricter &s;ub&s;criptions. If articles of <HI>peace,</HI> as they
are called, that is, engagements not to preach certain doc|trines,
or to revive certain controver&s;ies, would exclude
indecent altercations among&s;t the national clergy, as well
as &s;ecure to the public teaching of religion as much of
uniformity and quiet as is nece&s;&s;ary to edification; then
confe&s;&s;ions of <HI>faith</HI> ought to be converted into articles of
<HI>peace.</HI> In a word, it ought to be held a &s;ufficient
rea&s;on for relaxing the terms of &s;ub&s;cription, or for drop|ping
any or all of the articles to be &s;ub&s;cribed, that no
<HI>pre&s;ent</HI> nece&s;&s;ity requires the &s;trictne&s;s which is complain|ed
of, or that it &s;hould be extended to &s;o many points of
doctrine.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the country into di&s;tricts, and the &s;ta|tioning
in each a teacher of religion, forms the &s;ub&s;tantial
part of every church e&s;tabli&s;hment. The varieties that
have been introduced into the government and di&s;cipline
of different churches are of inferior importance, when
compared with this, in which they all agree. Of the&s;e
oeconomical que&s;tions, none &s;eems more material than that
which has been long agitated in the reformed churches of
Chri&s;tendom, whether a parity among&s;t the clergy, or a
di&s;tinction of orders in the mini&s;try, be mo&s;t conducive
<PB N="570" REF="610">
to the general ends of the in&s;titution. In favour of that
&s;y&s;tem which the laws of this country have preferred, we
may alledge the following rea&s;ons; that it &s;ecures tran|quillity
and &s;ubordination among&s;t the clergy them&s;elves;
that it corre&s;ponds with the gradations of rank in civil
life, and provides for the edification of each rank, by &s;ta|tioning
in each an order of clergy of their own cla&s;s and
quality; and la&s;tly, that the &s;ame fund produces more
effect, both as an allurement to men of talents to enter
into the church, and as a &s;timulus to the indu&s;try of tho&s;e
who are already in it, when di&s;tributed into prizes of
different value, than when divided into equal &s;hares.</P>
<P>After the &s;tate has once e&s;tabli&s;hed a particular &s;y&s;tem
of faith as a national religion, a que&s;tion will &s;oon occur,
concerning the treatment and toleration of tho&s;e who di&s;|&s;ent
from it.&mdash;And this que&s;tion is properly preceded by
another, concerning the right which the civil magi&s;trate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to interfere in matters of religion at all; for
although this right be acknowledged whil&s;t he is em|ployed
&s;olely in providing means of public in&s;truction, it
will probably be di&s;puted, indeed it ever has been, when
he proceeds to inflict penalties, to impo&s;e re&s;traints, or in|capacities
on the account of religious di&s;tinctions. They
who acknowledge no other ju&s;t original of civil govern|ment,
than what is founded in &s;ome &s;tipulation with its
&s;ubjects, may with probability contend that the concerns
of religion were excepted out of the &s;ocial compact; that
in an affair which is tran&s;acted between God and a man's
<PB N="571" REF="611">
own con&s;cience, no commi&s;&s;ion or authority was ever de|legated
to the civil magi&s;trate, or could indeed be tran&s;|&s;erred
from the per&s;on him&s;elf to any other. We, how|ever,
who have rejected this theory, becau&s;e we cannot
di&s;cover any actual contract between the &s;tate and the
people, and becau&s;e we cannot allow an arbitrary fiction
to be made the foundation of real rights and of real obli|gations,
find our&s;elves precluded from this di&s;tinction.
The rea&s;oning which deduces the authority of civil go|vernment
from the will of God, and which collects that
will from public expediency alone, binds us to the unre|&s;erved
conclu&s;ion, that the juri&s;diction of the magi&s;trate is
limited by no con&s;ideration but that of general utility: In
plainer terms, that whatever be the &s;ubject to be regulated,
it is lawful for him to interfere, whenever his interference,
in its general tendency, appears to be conducive to the
common intere&s;t. There is nothing in the nature of re|ligion,
as &s;uch, which exempts it from the authority of
the legi&s;lator, when the &s;afety or welfare of the commu|nity
requires his interpo&s;ition. It has been &s;aid indeed,
that religion, pertaining to the intere&s;ts of a life to come,
lies out of the province of civil government, the office of
which is confined to the affairs of this life. But in reply to
this objection, it may be ob&s;erved, that when the laws
interfere even in religion, they interfere only with tem|porals:
Their effects terminate, their power acts only
upon tho&s;e rights and intere&s;ts, which confe&s;&s;edly belong
to their di&s;po&s;al. The re&s;olutions of the legi&s;lature, the
edicts of the prince, the &s;entence of the judge, cannot
<PB N="572" REF="612">
affect my &s;alvation; nor do they, without the mo&s;t ab&s;urd
arrogance, pretend to any &s;uch power: but they may
deprive me of liberty, of property, and even of life it&s;elf
on account of my religion; and however I may complain
of the inju&s;tice of the &s;entence, by which I am condemned,
I cannot alledge, that the magi&s;trate has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the
boundaries of his juri&s;diction, becau&s;e the property, the
liberty, and the life of the &s;ubject, may be taken away
by the authority of the laws, for any rea&s;on, which, in the
judgment of the legi&s;lature, renders &s;uch a mea&s;ure nece&s;|&s;ary
to the common welfare. Moreover, as the precepts
of religion may regulate all the offices of life, or may be &s;o
con&s;trued as to extend to all, the exemption of religion
from the controll of human laws might afford a plea,
which would exclude civil government from all authority
over the conduct of its &s;ubjects. Religious liberty is like
civil liberty, not an immunity from re&s;traint, but the being
re&s;trained by no law, but what in a greater degree con|duces
to the public welfare.</P>
<P>Still it is right &startq;to obey God rather than, man.&endq; No|thing
that we have &s;aid encroaches upon the truth of this
&s;acred and undi&s;puted maxim: the right of the magi&s;trate
to ordain, and the obligation of the &s;ubject to obey, in
matters of religion, may be very different; and will be &s;o as
often as they flow from oppo&s;ite apprehen&s;ions of the divine
will. In affairs that are properly of a civil nature, in &startq;the
things that are Cae&s;ar's,&endq; this difference &s;eldom happens.
The law authorizes the act which it enjoins; revelation being
<PB N="573" REF="613">
either &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject, or referring it to the laws
of the country, or requiring only that men act by &s;ome
fixed rule, and that this rule be e&s;tabli&s;hed by competent
authority. But when human, laws interpo&s;e their direc|tion
in matters of religion, by dictating, for example, the
object or mode of divine wor&s;hip; by prohibiting the profe&s;|&s;ion
of &s;ome articles of faith, and by exacting that of others,
they are liable to cla&s;h with what private per&s;ons believe
to be already &s;ettled by precepts of revelation, or to contra|dict
what God him&s;elf, they think, hath declared to be
true. In this ca&s;e, on whichever &s;ide the mi&s;take lies, or
whatever plea, the &s;tate may alledge to ju&s;tify its edict, the
&s;ubject can have none to excu&s;e his compliance. The &s;ame
con&s;ideration al&s;o &s;hews us the di&s;tinction as to the
authority of the &s;tate between temporals and &s;pirituals.
The magi&s;trate is not to be obeyed in one, any more than
in the other, where any repugnancy is perceived between
his commands, and certain credited manife&s;tations of the
divine will; but &s;uch repugnancies, are much le&s;s likely
to ari&s;e in one ca&s;e than the other.</P>
<P>When we grant that it is lawful for the magi&s;trate to
interfere in religion as often as his interference appears to
him to conduce, in its general tendency, to the public
happine&s;s; it may be argued from, this conce&s;&s;ion, that
&s;ince &s;alvation is the highe&s;t intere&s;t of mankind, and &s;ince
con&s;equently to advance <HI>that</HI> is to promote the public hap|pine&s;s
in the be&s;t way, and in the greate&s;t degree, in which
it can be promoted; it follows, that it is not only the
<PB N="574" REF="614">
right, but the duty of every magi&s;trate, inve&s;ted with &s;upreme
power, to enforce upon his &s;ubjects the reception
of that religion, which he deems mo&s;t acceptable to God;
and to enforce it by &s;uch methods as may appear
mo&s;t effectual for the end propo&s;ed. A popi&s;h king, for
example, who &s;hould believe that &s;alvation is not attain|able
out of the precincts of the Romi&s;h church, would
derive a right, from our principles, not to &s;ay that he would
be bound by them, to employ the power, with which the
con&s;titution intru&s;ted him, and which power, in ab&s;olute
monarchies, commands the lives and fortunes of every
&s;ubject of the empire, in reducing his people within that
communion. We confe&s;s that this con&s;equence is infer|red
from the principles we have laid down concerning the
foundation of civil authority, not without the re&s;emblance
of a regular deduction:&mdash;we con&s;e&s;s al&s;o, that it is a con|clu&s;ion
which it behoves us to di&s;po&s;e of; becau&s;e if it
really followed from our theory of government, the theory
it&s;elf ought to be given up. Now it will be remembered,
that the terms of our propo&s;ition are the&s;e: &startq;That it is
lawful for the magi&s;trate to interfere in the affairs of re|ligion,
whenever his interference appears to him to con|duce,
by its general tendency, to the public happine&s;s.&endq;
The clau&s;e of &startq;general tendency,&endq; when this rule comes to
be applied, will be found a very &s;ignificant part of the
direction. It obliges the magi&s;trate to reflect, not only,
whether the religion, which he wi&s;hes to propagate
among&s;t his &s;ubjects, be that which will be&s;t &s;ecure their
eternal welfare: not only, whether the methods he em|ploys
<PB N="575" REF="615">
be likely to effectuate the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that
religion; but al&s;o upon this farther que&s;tion, whether the
kind of interference, which he is about to exerci&s;e, if it
were adopted as a common maxim among&s;t &s;tates and
princes, or received as a general rule for the conduct of
government in matters of religion, would, upon the whole,
and in the ma&s;s of in&s;tances, in which his example might
be imitated, conduce to the furtherance of human &s;alva|tion.
If the magi&s;trate, for example, &s;hould think, that,
although the application of his power might, in the in|&s;tance
concerning which he deliberates, advance the true
religion, and together with it the happine&s;s of his people,
yet that the &s;ame engine in other hands, who might a&s;&s;ume
the right to u&s;e it with the like preten&s;ions of rea&s;on and
authority that he him&s;elf alledges, would more frequently
&s;hut out truth, and ob&s;truct the means of &s;alvation; he
would be bound by this opinion, and &s;till admitting pub|lic
utility to be the &s;upreme rule of his conduct, to refrain
from expedients, which, whatever particular effects <HI>he</HI> may
expect from them, are in their general operation dangerous
or hurtful. If there be any difficulty in the &s;ub|ject,
it ari&s;es from that, which is the cau&s;e of every
difficulty in morals, the competition of particular and
general con&s;equences&mdash;or what is the &s;ame thing, the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of one general rule to another rule, which is &s;till
more general.</P>
<P>Bearing then in mind that it is the <HI>general</HI> tendency of
the mea&s;ure, or in other words, the effects which would
<PB N="576" REF="616">
ari&s;e from the mea&s;ure being <HI>generally</HI> adopted, that fixes
upon it the character of rectitude or inju&s;tice; we pro|ceed
to inquire what is the degree and the &s;ort of inter|ference
of &s;ecular laws in matters of religion, which are
likely to be beneficial to the public happine&s;s. There are
two maxims which will in a great mea&s;ure regulate our
conclu&s;ions upon this head. The fir&s;t is, that any form
of Chri&s;tianity is better than no religion at all; the &s;econd,
that of different &s;y&s;tems of faith, that is the be&s;t, which is
the true&s;t. The fir&s;t of the&s;e po&s;itions will hardly be di&s;|puted,
when we reflect, that every &s;ect and modification
of Chri&s;tianity holds out the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of ano|ther
life, as depending chiefly upon the practice of virtue
or of vice in this; and that the di&s;tinctions of virtue and
vice are nearly the &s;ame in all. A per&s;on, who acts under
the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e hopes and fears, though com|bined
with many errors and &s;uper&s;titions, is more likely
to advance both the public happine&s;s and his own, than
one who is de&s;titute of all expectation of a future ac|count.
The latter propo&s;ition is founded in the con&s;ideration,
that the principal importance of religion, con&s;i&s;ts in
its influence upon the fate and condition of a future exi&s;t|ence.
This influence belongs only to that religion which
comes from God. A political religion, may be framed,
which &s;hall embrace the purpo&s;es, and de&s;cribe the duties
of political &s;ociety perfectly well; but if it be not deli|vered
by God, what a&s;&s;urance does it afford, that the
deci&s;ions of the divine judgment will have any regard
to the rules which it contains? By a man who acts with
<PB N="577" REF="617">
view to a future judgment, the authority of a religion,
is the fir&s;t thing enquired after: a religion, which wants
authority, with him wants every thing. Since then this
authority appertains not to the religion which is mo&s;t
commodious; to the religion which is mo&s;t &s;ublime and
efficacious; to the religion which &s;uits be&s;t with the
con&s;titution, or &s;eems mo&s;t calculated to uphold the power
and &s;tability of civil government; but only to that reli|gion
which comes from God, we are ju&s;tified in pro|nouncing
the <HI>true</HI> religion, by its very <HI>truth,</HI> and indepen|dently
of all con&s;iderations of tendencies, aptne&s;&s;es, or any
other internal qualities whatever, to be univer&s;ally the <HI>be&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> proposition follows this inference, that
when the &s;tate enables its &s;ubjects to learn <HI>&s;ome</HI> form of
Chri&s;tianity, by di&s;tributing teachers of a religious &s;y&s;tem
throughout the country, and by providing for the main|tenance
of the&s;e teachers at the public expence; that is,
in fewer terms, when the laws e&s;tabli&s;h a national religion,
they exerci&s;e a power and an interference, which are likely,
in their general tendency, to promote the intere&s;t of
mankind: for even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;pecies of Chri&s;tianity;
which the laws patronize, to he erroneous and corrupt,
yet when the option lies between this religion and no
religion at all, which would be the con&s;equence of leaving
the people without any public means of in&s;truction, or any
regular celebration of the offices of Chri&s;tianity, our
propo&s;ition teaches us that, the former alternative is con|&s;tantly
to be preferred.</P>
<P><PB N="578" REF="618">
But after the right of the magi&s;trate to e&s;tabli&s;h a parti|cular
religion has been, upon this principle, admitted; a
doubt &s;ometimes pre&s;ents it&s;elf, whether the religion which
he ought to e&s;tabli&s;h be that which he him&s;elf profe&s;&s;es,
or that which he ob&s;erves to prevail among&s;t the majority of
the people. Now when we con&s;ider this que&s;tion with a
view to the formation of a general rule upon the &s;ubject, and
which view alone can furni&s;h a ju&s;t &s;olution of the doubt, it
mu&s;t be a&s;&s;umed to be an equal chance whether of the two
religions is the more true, that of the magi&s;trate, or that of
the people. The chance then that is left to truth being equal
upon both &s;uppo&s;itions, the remaining con&s;ideration will
be, from which arrangement more efficacy can be expected&mdash;from
an order of men appointed to teach the people their
own religion, or to convert them to another. In my
opinion the advantage lies on the &s;ide of the former &s;cheme:
and this opinion, if it be a&s;&s;ented to, makes it the duty of
the magi&s;trate, in the choice of the religion which he
e&s;tabli&s;hes, to con&s;ult the faith of the nation rather than
his own.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e al&s;o of di&s;&s;enters mu&s;t be determined by the
principles ju&s;t now &s;tated. <HI>Toleration</HI> is of two kinds,&mdash;the
allowing to di&s;&s;enters the unmole&s;ted profe&s;&s;ion and exer|ci&s;e
of their religion, but with an exclu&s;ion from offices of
tru&s;t and emolument in the &s;tate, which is a <HI>partial</HI>
toleration; and the admitting them without di&s;tinction, to
all the civil privileges and capacities of other citizens,
<PB N="579" REF="619">
which is a <HI>complete</HI> toleration. The general expediency of
toleration, and con&s;equently the general right of the &s;ubject
to demand it, as far as relates to liberty of con&s;cience, and
the claim of being protected in the free and &s;afe profe&s;&s;ion
of his religion, is deducible from the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of tho&s;e
propo&s;itions, which we have delivered as the grounds of
our conclu&s;ions upon the &s;ubject. That propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erts
truth, and truth in the ab&s;tract, to be the &s;upreme perfec|tion
of every religion. The advancement con&s;equently, and
di&s;covery of truth, is that end to which all regulations
concerning religion ought principally to be adapted. Now
every &s;pecies of intolerance which enjoins &s;uppre&s;&s;ion and
&s;ilence; and every &s;pecies of per&s;ecution which enforces
&s;uch injunctions, is adver&s;e to the progre&s;s of truth; for|a&s;much
as it cau&s;es that to be fixed by one &s;et of men, at
one time, which is much better, and with much more
probability of &s;ucce&s;s, left to the independent and pro|gre&s;&s;ive
enquiries of &s;eparate individuals. Truth re&s;ults
from di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and from controver&s;y&mdash;is investigated by
the labours and re&s;earches of private per&s;ons. Whatever
therefore prohibits the&s;e, ob&s;tructs that indu&s;try and that
liberty, which it is the common intere&s;t of mankind to
promote. In religion, as in other &s;ubjects, truth, if left to
it&s;elf, will almo&s;t always gain the a&s;cendency. If different
religions be profe&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame country, and the minds
of men be unfettered and unawed by intimidations of law,
that religion, which is founded in maxims of rea&s;on and
credibility, will gradually gain over the other to it. I
do not mean, that men will formally renounce their ancient
<PB N="580" REF="620">
religion, but that they will adopt into it the more
rational doctrines, the improvements and di&s;coveries of
the neighbouring &s;ect; by which means the wor&s;e reli|gion,
without the ceremony of a reformation, will in&s;en&s;ibly
a&s;&s;imulate it&s;elf to the better. If popery, for in&s;tance,
and prote&s;tanti&s;m were permitted to dwell quietly
together, papi&s;ts might not become prote&s;tants, (for the
name is commonly the la&s;t thing that is changed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Would we let the <HI>name</HI> &s;tand, we might often attract men, without their perceiving it, much nearer to our&s;elves, than, if they did perceive it, they would be willing to come.</NOTE>) but,
they would become more enlightened and informed; they
would by little and little incorporate into their creed
many of the tenets of prote&s;tanti&s;m, as well as imbibe
a portion of its &s;pirit and moderation.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice and expediency of toleration we found
<HI>principally</HI> in its conducivene&s;s to truth, and in the &s;upe|rior
value of truth to that of any other quality which a
religion can po&s;&s;e&s;s: but there are &s;ome auxiliary con&s;ider|ations
too important to be omitted. The confining of the
&s;ubject to the religion of the &s;tate, is a needle&s;s violation
of natural liberty, and in an in&s;tance in which con&s;traint is
always grievous. Per&s;ecution produces no &s;incere con|viction,
nor any real change of opinion; on the contrary,
it depraves the public morals by driving men to prevari|cation
and commonly ends in a general tho' &s;ecret
infidelity, by impo&s;ing, under the name of revealed
religion, &s;y&s;tems of doctrine which men cannot believe,
<PB N="581" REF="621">
and dare not examine&mdash;finally, it di&s;graces the character
and wounds the reputation, of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, by
making it the author of oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty and blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>Under the idea of religious toleration I include the
toleration of all books of &s;erious argumentation; but I
deem it no infringement of religious liberty to re&s;train the
circulation of ridicule, inventive and mockery upon reli|gious
&s;ubjects. Becau&s;e this &s;pecies of writing applies
&s;olely to the pa&s;&s;ions, weakens the judgment, and contami|nates
the imagination of its readers; has no tendency
whatever to a&s;&s;i&s;t either the inve&s;tigation or the impre&s;&s;ion
of truth; on the contrary, whil&s;t it &s;tays not to di&s;tingui&s;h
the character or authority of different religions, it de&s;troys alike the influence of all.</P>
<P>Concerning the admi&s;&s;ion of di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
religion to offices and employments in the public
&s;ervice, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render toleration <HI>complete,</HI>
doubts have been entertained with &s;ome appearance of
rea&s;on. It is po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch religious opinions may
be holden as are utterly incompatible with the nece&s;&s;ary
functions of civil government; and which opinions con|&s;equently
di&s;qualify tho&s;e who maintain them, from
exerci&s;ing any &s;hare in its admini&s;tration. There have
been enthu&s;ia&s;ts who held that Chri&s;tianity has aboli&s;hed
all di&s;tinction of property, and that &s;he enjoins upon her followers a community of goods. With what tolerable
propriety could one of this &s;ect be appointed a judge or a
<PB N="582" REF="622">
magi&s;trate, who&s;e office it was to decide upon que&s;tions of
private right, and to protect men in the exclu&s;ive enjoy|ment
of their property. It would not be le&s;s ab&s;urd than
to entru&s;t a military command to a quaker, who believes
it to be contrary to the go&s;pel to take up arms. This is
po&s;&s;ible; therefore it cannot be laid down as an univer&s;al
truth, that religion is not in its nature a cau&s;e which will
ju&s;tify exclu&s;ion from public employments. When we
view, however, the &s;ects of Chri&s;tianity which actually
prevail in the world, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that with the &s;ingle
exception, of refu&s;ing to bear arms, we find no tenet in
any of them, which incapacitates men for the &s;ervice of
the &s;tate. It has indeed been a&s;&s;erted, that di&s;cordancy of
religions, even &s;uppo&s;ing each religion to be free from any
errors that affect the &s;afety or the conduct of government,
is enough to render men unfit to act together in public &s;ta|tions.
But upon what argument or upon what experience,
is this a&s;&s;ertion founded? I perceive no rea&s;on why men
of different religious per&s;ua&s;ions, may not &s;it upon the &s;ame
bench, deliberate in the &s;ame, council, or fight in the &s;ame
ranks, as well as men of various or oppo&s;ite opinions upon
any controverted topic of natural philo&s;ophy, hi&s;tory, on
ethics.</P>
<P>There are two ca&s;es, in which te&s;t laws, are wont to be
applied, and in which, if in any, they may be defended.
One is where two or more religions are contending for
e&s;tabli&s;hment; and where there appears no way of putting
an end to the conte&s;t, but by giving to one religion &s;uch a
<PB N="583" REF="623">
decided &s;uperiority in the legi&s;lature and government of
the country, as to &s;ecure it again&s;t danger from any other.
I own that I &s;hould a&s;&s;ent to this precaution with many
&s;cruples. If the di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hment become
a majority of the people, the e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf ought to
be altered or qualified. If there exi&s;t among&s;t the different
&s;ects of the country &s;uch a parity of numbers, intere&s;t and
power, as to render the preference of one &s;ect to the re&s;t,
and the choice of that &s;ect, a matter of hazardous &s;ucce&s;s,
and of doubtful election; &s;ome plan &s;imilar to that which
is meditated in North America, and which we have
de&s;cribed in a preceding part of this chapter, may perhaps
&s;uit better with this divided &s;tate of public opinions, than
any con&s;titution of a national church whatever. In all
other &s;ituations, the e&s;tabli&s;hment will be &s;trong enough
to maintain it&s;elf. However if a te&s;t be applicable with
ju&s;tice upon this principle at all, it ought to be applied
in regal governments to the chief magi&s;trate him&s;elf,
who&s;e power might otherwi&s;e overthrow or change the
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country, in oppo&s;ition to the
will and &s;entiments of the people.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e of <HI>exclu&s;ion,</HI> and in which, I think,
the mea&s;ure is more ea&s;ily vindicated, is that of a country
in which &s;ome di&s;affection to the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting government,
happens to be connected with certain religious di&s;tinctions.
The &s;tate undoubtedly has a right to refu&s;e its power
and its confidence to tho&s;e who &s;eek its de&s;truction.
Wherefore, if the generality of any religious &s;ect entertain
<PB N="584" REF="624">
di&s;po&s;itions ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution, and if government
have no other way of knowing its enemies than by the
religion they profe&s;s, the profe&s;&s;ors of that religion may
ju&s;tly be excluded from offices of tru&s;t and authority. But
even <HI>here</HI> it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that it is not again&s;t the
religion that government &s;huts its doors, but again&s;t the&s;e
political principles, which, however independent they
may be of any article of religious faith, the members of
that communion are found in fact to hold. Nor would
the legi&s;lator make religious tenets the te&s;t of men's
inclinations towards the &s;tate, if he could di&s;cover any
other that was equally certain and notorious. Thus if
the members of the Romi&s;h church, for the mo&s;t part
adhere to the intere&s;ts, or maintain the right of a foreign
pretender to the crown of the&s;e kingdoms; and if there
be no way of di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e who do, from tho&s;e who
do not retain &s;uch dangerous prejudices; government is
well warranted in fencing out the whole &s;ect from &s;itua|tions
of tru&s;t and power. But even in this example it is
not to popery that the laws object, but to popery as the
mark of jacobiti&s;m; an equivocal indeed and fallacious
mark, but the be&s;t, and perhaps the only one that can be
devi&s;ed. But then it &s;hould be remembered, that as
the connection between popery and jacobiti&s;m, which is
the &s;ole cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, and the &s;ole ju&s;tification of
tho&s;e &s;evere and jealous laws which have been enacted
again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of what religion, was accidental in
its origin, &s;o probably it will be temporary in its duration;
and that the&s;e re&s;trictions ought not to continue one day
<PB N="585" REF="625">
longer, than &s;ome vi&s;ible danger renders them nece&s;&s;ary
to the pre&s;ervation of public tranquillity.</P>
<P>After all, it may be a&s;ked, why &s;hould not the
legi&s;lator direct his te&s;t again&s;t the political principles
them&s;elves, which he wi&s;hes to exclude, rather than
encounter them through the medium of religious
tenets, the only crime and the only danger of which
con&s;i&s;t in their pre&s;umed alliance with the former? Why,
for example, &s;hould a man be required to renounce tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation,
before he be admitted to ail office in the
&s;tate, when it might &s;eem to be &s;ufficient that he abjure
the pretender? There are but two an&s;wers that can be
given to the objection which this que&s;tion contains; fir&s;t,
that it is not opinions which the laws fear, &s;o much as
inclinations, and that political inclinations are not &s;o ea&s;ily
detected by the affirmation or denial of any ab&s;tract propo|&s;ition
in politics, as by the di&s;covery of the religious creed
with which they are wont to be united: &s;econdly, that
when men renounce their religion, they commonly quit
all connection with the members of the church which
they have left; that church no longer expecting a&s;&s;i&s;tance
or friend&s;hip from them: whereas particular per&s;ons
might in&s;inuate them&s;elves into offices of tru&s;t and autho|rity
by &s;ub&s;cribing political a&s;&s;ertions, and yet retain their
predilection for the intere&s;ts of the religious &s;ect to which
they continued to belong. By which means government
would &s;ometimes find, though it could not accu&s;e
individual, whom it had received into its &s;ervice, of
<PB N="586" REF="626">
di&s;affection to the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, yet that, through
him, it had communicated the aid and influence of a
powerful &s;tation to a party who were ho&s;tile to the con&s;ti|tution.
The&s;e an&s;wers however, we propo&s;e, rather
than defend. The mea&s;ure certainly cannot be defended
at all, except where the &s;u&s;pected union between certain
obnoxious principles in politics, and certain tenets in reli|gion,
is nearly univer&s;al: in which ca&s;e it makes little dif|ference
to the &s;ub&s;criber, whether the te&s;t be religious or
political; and the &s;tate is &s;omewhat better &s;ecured by the
one than the other.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of our examination of tho&s;e general ten|dencies,
by which every interference of civil government
in matters of religion ought to be tried, is this. &startq;That a
<HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> national religion, guarded by a few articles
of peace and conformity; with a legal provi&s;ion for the
clergy of that religion; and with a <HI>complete</HI> toleration of
all di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, without any other
limitation or exception, than what ari&s;es from the conjunc|tion
of dangerous political di&s;po&s;itions with certain reli|gious
tenets, appears to be, not only the mo&s;t ju&s;t and
liberal, but the wi&s;e&s;t and &s;afe&s;t &s;y&s;tem, which a &s;tate can
adopt: ina&s;much as it unites the &s;everal perfections which
a religious con&s;titution ought to aim at&mdash;liberty of con|&s;cience,
with means of in&s;truction; the progre&s;s of truth,
with the peace of &s;ociety; the right of private judgment,
with the care of the public &s;afety.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Population and Provi&s;ion; and of Agriculture and Commerce, as &s;ub&s;ervient thereto.</HEAD>
<P>THE final view of all rational politics is to produce
the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s in a given tract
of country. The riches, &s;trength, and glory of nations,
the topics which hi&s;tory celebrates, and which alone almo&s;t
engage the prai&s;es, arid excite the admiration of mankind,
have no value farther than as they contribute to this end.
When they interfere with it, they are evils, and not the
le&s;s real, for the &s;plendour that &s;urrounds them.</P>
<P>Secondly, altho' we &s;peak of communities as of &s;en|tient
beings; altho' we a&s;cribe to them happine&s;s and
mi&s;ery, de&s;ires, intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, nothing really
exi&s;ts or feels but <HI>individuals.</HI> The happine&s;s of a people
is made up of the happine&s;s of &s;ingle per&s;ons; and the
<PB N="588" REF="628">
quantity of it can only be augmented by encrea&s;ing the num|ber
of the percipients, or the plea&s;ures of their perceptions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Notwith&s;tanding that diver&s;ity of condition,
e&s;pecially different degrees of plenty, freedom and &s;ecu|rity,
greatly vary the quantity of happine&s;s enjoyed by
the &s;ame number of individuals; and notwith&s;tanding
that extreme ca&s;es may be found, of human beings &s;o galled
by the rigours of &s;lavery, that the increa&s;e of numbers
is only the amplification of mi&s;ery; yet, within certain
limits, and within tho&s;e limits to which civil life is diver|&s;ified,
under the temperate governments that obtain in
Europe, it may be affirmed, I think, with certainty,
that the quantity of happine&s;s produced in any given
di&s;trict, (the object to which all the endeavours of public
wi&s;dom &s;hould be directed,) <HI>&s;o far</HI> depends upon the num|ber
of inhabitants, that, in comparing adjoining periods,
in the &s;ame country, the collective happine&s;s will be nearly
in the exact proportion of the numbers, that is, twice the
number of inhabitants will produce double the quantity
of happine&s;s; in di&s;tant periods, and different countries,
under great changes or great di&s;&s;imilitude of civil con|dition,
although the proportion of enjoyment may fall
much &s;hort of that of the numbers, yet &s;till, any
con&s;iderable exce&s;s of numbers will u&s;ually carry with
it a preponderation of happine&s;s; that at lea&s;t, it
may, and ought to be a&s;&s;umed, in all political delibera|tions,
that a larger portion of happine&s;s is enjoyed among&s;t
<HI>ten</HI> per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the means of healthy &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
<PB N="589" REF="629">
than can be produced by <HI>five</HI> per&s;ons, under every advan|tage
of power, affluence and luxury.</P>
<P>From the&s;e principles it follows, that the quantity of
happine&s;s in a given di&s;trict, although it is po&s;&s;ible it may be
increa&s;ed, the number of inhabitants remaining the &s;ame, is
chiefly and mo&s;t naturally affected by alteration of the num|bers:
that, con&s;equently, the decay of population is the
greate&s;t evil that a &s;tate can &s;uffer; and the improvement of
it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at,
in preference to every other political purpo&s;e whatsoever.</P>
<P>The importance of population, and the &s;uperiority of
<HI>it</HI> above every other national advantage, are points nece&s;|&s;ary
to be inculcated, and to be well under&s;tood; ina&s;|much
as fal&s;e e&s;timates, or fanta&s;tic notions of national
grandeur, are perpetually drawing the attention of &s;tate&s;|men
and legi&s;lators from the care of this, which is, at all
times, the true and ab&s;olute intere&s;t of a country: for
which rea&s;on, we have &s;tated the&s;e points with unu&s;ual
formality; we will confe&s;s, however, that a competition
can &s;eldom ari&s;e between the advancement of population
and any mea&s;ure of &s;ober utility; becau&s;e, in the ordinary
progre&s;s of human affairs, whatever, in any way, con|tributes
to make a people happier, tends to render them
more numerous.</P>
<P>In the &s;ecundity of the human, as of every other &s;pecies
of animals, nature has provided for an indefinite multipli|cation.
<PB N="590" REF="630">
Mankind have increa&s;ed to their pre&s;ent number
from a &s;ingle pair: the offspring of early marriagess, in
the ordinary cour&s;e of procreation, do more than replace
the parents: in countries, and under circum&s;tances very
favourable to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the population has been doubled
in the &s;pace of twenty years: the havock occa&s;ioned by
wars, earthquakes, famine, or pe&s;tilence, is u&s;ually re|paired
in a &s;hort time. The&s;e indications &s;ufficiently
demon&s;trate the tendency of nature hi the human &s;pecies
to a continual increa&s;e of its numbers. It becomes there|fore
a que&s;tion that may rea&s;onably be propounded,
What are the cau&s;es which confine or check the natural
progre&s;s of this multiplication? And the an&s;wer which
fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the thoughts of the enquirer is,
that the population of a country mu&s;t &s;top when the
country can maintain no more, that is, when the inhabi|tants
are already &s;o numerous as to exhau&s;t all the pro|vi&s;ion
which the &s;oil can be made to produce. This how|ever,
though an in&s;uperable bar, will &s;eldom be found to
be <HI>that,</HI> which actually checks the progre&s;s of population,
in any country of the world; becau&s;e the number of the
people have &s;eldom, in any country, arrived at this limit, or
even approached to it. The fertility of the ground, in tem|perate
regions, is capable of being improved by cultivation
to an extent which is unknown; much, however, beyond
the &s;tate of improvement in any country in Europe. In
our own, which holds almo&s;t the fir&s;t place in the know|ledge
and encouragement of agriculture, let it only be
&s;uppo&s;ed that every field in England of the &s;ame
original
<PB N="591" REF="631">
quality with the&s;e in the neighbourhood of the metro|polis,
and con&s;equently capable of the &s;ame fertility,
were by a like management made to yield, an equal pro|duce,
and it may be a&s;&s;erted, I believe, with truth, that
the quantity of human provi&s;ion, rai&s;ed in the i&s;land,
would be increa&s;ed, fivefold. The two principles, there|fore,
upon which population &s;eems primarily to depend,
the fecundity of the &s;pecies, and the capacity of the &s;oil,
would in mo&s;t, perhaps in all countries, enable it to pro|ceed
much farther than it has yet advanced. The num|ber
of marriageable women, who, in each country,
remain unmarried, afford, a computation how much the
agency of nature in the diffu&s;ion of human life is cramped
and contracted; and the quantity of wa&s;te, neglected,
or mi&s;managed &s;urface, together with a compari&s;on, like
the preceding, of the crops rai&s;ed from the &s;oil in the
neighbourhood of populous cities, and under a perfect
&s;tate of cultivation, with tho&s;e, which lands of equal or
&s;uperior quality yield in different &s;ituations, will &s;how, in
what proportion the indigenous productions of the earth
are capable of being farther augmented.</P>
<P>The fundamental propo&s;ition upon the &s;ubject of popu|lation,
which mu&s;t guide every endeavour to improve it,
and from which every conclu&s;ion concerning it may be
deduced, is this: &startq;Whererever the commerce between
the &s;exes is regulated by marriage, and a provi&s;ion for that
mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to which each cla&s;s of the commu|nity
is accu&s;tomed, can be procured with ea&s;e and cer|tainty,
<PB N="592" REF="632">
there the numbers of the people will increa&s;e;
and the rapidity, as well as the extent of the increa&s;e
will be proportioned to the degree in which the&s;e cau&s;es
exi&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition we will draw out into the &s;everal prin|ciples
which it contains.</P>
<P>I. Fir&s;t, the propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erts the &startq;nece&s;&s;ity of con|fining
the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes to the marriage union.&endq;
It is only in the marriage union that this intercour&s;e is
&s;ufficiently prolific. Be&s;ide which, family e&s;tabli&s;hments
alone are fitted to perpetuate a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations.
The offspring of a vague and promi&s;cuous concubinage are
not only few, and liable to peri&s;h by neglect, but are &s;eldom
prepared for, or introduced into &s;ituations &s;uited to the
rai&s;ing of families of their own. Now, nature in the
con&s;titution, of the &s;exes has provided a &s;timulus, which
will infallibly &s;ecure the frequency of marriages, with all
their beneficial effects upon the &s;tate of population, pro|vided
the male part of the &s;pecies be prohibited from
irregular gratifications. This impul&s;e, which is &s;ufficient
to &s;urmount almo&s;t every impediment to marriage, will
operate in proportion to the difficulty, expence, danger,
or infamy, the &s;en&s;e of guilt, or the fear of puni&s;hment,
which attend licentious indulgences. Wherefore, in
countries where &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is become &s;carce, it behoves
the &s;tate to watch over the public morals with increa&s;ed
<PB N="593" REF="633">
&s;olicitude; for nothing but the in&s;tinct of nature, under
the re&s;traint of cha&s;tity, will induce men to undertake the
labour, or con&s;ent to that &s;acrifice of per&s;onal liberty and
indulgence, which the &s;upport of a family, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances,
requires.</P>
<P>II. The &s;econd requi&s;ite which the propo&s;ition &s;tates,
as nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of population, is, &startq;The ea&s;e
and certainty with which a provi&s;ion can be procured for
that mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to which each cla&s;s of the com|munity
is accu&s;tomed.&endq; It is not enough that men's
<HI>natural</HI> wants be &s;upplied, that a provi&s;ion adequate
to the actual nece&s;&s;ities of human life be attainable: ha|bitual
&s;uperfluities become real wants; opinion and fa&s;hion
convert articles of ornament and luxury into nece&s;&s;aries of
life. And it mu&s;t not be expected from men in general,
at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent relaxed &s;tate of morals and di&s;cipline,
that they will enter into marriages which degrade their
condition, reduce their mode of living, deprive them of
the accommodations to which they have been accu&s;tomed,
or even of tho&s;e ornaments or appendages of rank and
&s;tation, which they have been taught to regard as be|longing
to their birth, or cla&s;s, or profe&s;&s;ion, or place in
&s;ociety. The &s;ame con&s;ideration, namely, a view to
their <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> mode of life, which is &s;o apparent in the
&s;uperior orders of the people, has no le&s;s influence
upon tho&s;e ranks which compo&s;e the ma&s;s of the
community. The kind and quality of food and liquor,
the &s;pecies of habitation, furniture and cloathing, to
<PB N="594" REF="634">
which the common people of each country are habituated,
mu&s;t be attainable with ea&s;e and certainty before mar|riages
will be &s;ufficiently early and general, to carry the
progre&s;s of population to its ju&s;t extent. It is in vain to
alledge, that a more &s;imple diet, ruder habitations, or
coar&s;er apparel, would be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of
life and health, or even of phy&s;ical ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.
Men will not marry with this encouragement. For
in&s;tance, when the common people of a country are
accu&s;tomed to eat a large proportion of animal food, to
drink wine, &s;pirits, or beer, to wear &s;hoes and &s;tock|ings,
to dwell in &s;tone hou&s;es, they will not marry to
live in clay cottages, upon roots and milk, with no other
cloathing than &s;kins, or what is nece&s;&s;ary to defend the
trunk of the body from the effects of cold, although
the&s;e la&s;t may be all that the &s;u&s;tentation of life and
health requires, or that even contribute much to animal
comfort and enjoyment.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e then, and certainty, with which the means
can be procured, not barely of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but of that
mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, which cu&s;tom hath in each country
e&s;tabli&s;hed, form the point upon which the &s;tate and
progre&s;s of population chiefly depend. Now, there are
three cau&s;es which evidently regulate this point. The
mode it&s;elf of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting which prevails in the country;
the quantity of provi&s;ion &s;uited to that mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence,
which is either rai&s;ed in the country, or imported
into it; and la&s;tly, the di&s;tribution of that provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="595" REF="635">
The&s;e three cau&s;es merit di&s;tinct con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I. The mode of livings which actually obtains in a
country. In China, where the inhabitants frequent
the &s;ea &s;hore, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, upon fi&s;h,
the population is de&s;cribed to be exce&s;&s;ive. This pecu|liarity
ari&s;es, not probably from any civil advantages,
any care or policy, any particular con&s;titution, or &s;upe|rior
wi&s;dom of government, but &s;imply from hence, that
the &s;pecies of food, to which cu&s;tom hath reconciled the
de&s;ires and inclinations of the inhabitants, is that which,
of all others, is procured in the greate&s;t abundance, with
the mo&s;t ea&s;e, and requires the lea&s;t preparation. The
natives of Indo&s;tan, being confined by the laws of their
religion, to the u&s;e of vegetable food, and requiring little
except rice, which the country produces in plentiful
crops; and food, in warm climates, compo&s;ing the only
want of life; the&s;e countries are populous, under all
the injuries of a de&s;potic, and the agitations of an un&s;et|tled
government. If any revolution, or what would be
called perhaps refinement of manners, &s;hould generate
in the&s;e people a ta&s;te for the fle&s;h of animals, &s;imilar to
what prevails among&s;t the Arabian hordes; &s;hould intro|duce
flocks and herds into grounds which are now covered
with corn; &s;hould teach them to account a certain portion
of this &s;pecies of food among&s;t the nece&s;&s;aries of life;
the population, from this &s;ingle change, would &s;uffer in a
few years a great diminution: and this diminution would
follow, in &s;pite of every effort of the laws, or even of any
<PB N="596" REF="636">
improvement that might take place in their civil condition.
In Ireland, the &s;implicity of living alone maintains a
con&s;iderable degree of population, under great defects of
police, indu&s;try and commerce.</P>
<P>Under this head, and from a view of the&s;e con&s;idera|tions,
may be under&s;tood the true evil and proper danger
of <HI>luxury.</HI> Luxury, as it quickens circulation, as it
&s;upplies employment and promotes indu&s;try, a&s;&s;i&s;ts po|pulation.
But then, there is another con&s;equence attend|ing
it, which counteracts, and often overbalances the&s;e ad|vantages.
When, by introducing more &s;uperfluities into
general reception, luxury has rendered the u&s;ual accom|modations
of life more expen&s;ive, artificial and elaborate,
the difficulty of maintaining a family, conformably with
the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of living, becomes greater, and what
each man has to &s;pare from his per&s;onal con&s;umption,
proportionably le&s;s: the effect of which is, that mar|riages
grow le&s;s frequent, agreeably to the maxim above
laid down, and which mu&s;t be remembered as the foun|dation
of all our rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject, that men
will not marry to <HI>&s;ink</HI> their place or condition in &s;ociety,
or to forego tho&s;e indulgencies, which their own habits,
or what they ob&s;erve among&s;t their equals, have rendered
nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;atisfaction. This principle is applicable
to every article of diet and dre&s;s, to hou&s;es, furniture,
attendance; and this effect will be felt in every cla&s;s
of the community. For in&s;tance, the cu&s;tom of wear|ing
broad cloth, and fine linen, repays the &s;hepherd, and
<PB N="597" REF="637">
flax-grower, feeds the manufacturer, enriches the mer|chant,
gives, not only &s;upport, but exi&s;tence to mul|titudes
of families: hitherto, therefore, the effects are
beneficial: and were the&s;e the only effects, &s;uch elegancies,
or, if you plea&s;e to call them &s;o, &s;uch luxuries, could
not be too univer&s;al. But herein is the mi&s;chief, that,
when once fa&s;hion hath annexed the u&s;e of the&s;e articles
of dre&s;s to any certain cla&s;s, to the middling ranks, for
example, of the community, each individual of that rank
finds them to be <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of life; that is, finds him&s;elf
obliged to comply with the example of his equals, and
to maintain that appearance which the cu&s;tom of &s;ociety
requires. This obligation creates &s;uch a demand upon his
income, and withal adds &s;o much to the co&s;t and burthen
of a family, as to put it out of his power to marry,
with the pro&s;pect of continuing his habits, or of main|taining
his place and &s;ituation in the world. We &s;ee, in
this de&s;cription, the cau&s;e which induces men to wa&s;te
their lives in a barren celibacy; and this cau&s;e, which im|pairs
the very &s;ource of population, is ju&s;tly placed to the account of <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P>It appears then, that luxury, con&s;idered with a view
to population, acts by two oppo&s;ite effects; and it &s;eems
probable, that there exi&s;ts a point in the &s;cale, to which
luxury may a&s;cend, or, in other words, to which the
wants of mankind may be multiplied, with advantage
to the community, and beyond which the prejudicial
effects begin to preponderate. The determination of this
<PB N="598" REF="638">
point, though it a&s;&s;ume the form of an arithmetical pro|blem,
depends upon circum&s;tances too numerous, intri|cate,
and undefined, to admit of a preci&s;e &s;olution. How|ever,
from what has been ob&s;erved concerning, the ten|dency
of luxury to dimini&s;h marriages, in which tendency,
the evil of it resides, the following general conclu&s;ions
may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>1&s;t. That, of different kinds of luxury, tho&s;e are the the
mo&s;t innocent, which afford employment to the great|e&s;t
number of arti&s;ts, and manufacturers; or tho&s;e, in
other words, in which the price of the work bears the
greate&s;t proportion to that of the raw material. Thus,
luxury in dre&s;s or furniture is univer&s;ally preferable to
luxury in eating, becau&s;e the articles which con&s;titute the
one, are more the production of human art and indu&s;try,
than they which &s;upply the other.</P>
<P>2dly. That it is the <HI>diffu&s;ion,</HI> rather than the degree of
luxury, which is to be dreaded as a national evil. The
mi&s;chief of luxury con&s;i&s;ts, as we have &s;een, in the ob|&s;truction
that it forms to marriage. Now, it is only a
&s;mall part of the people that, the higher ranks in any
country compo&s;e; for which rea&s;on, the facility or the
difficulty of &s;upporting the expense of <HI>their</HI> &s;tation, and
the con&s;equent increa&s;e or diminution of marriages
among&s;t <HI>them,</HI> will influence the &s;tate of population but
little. So long as the prevalency of luxury is confined
to a few of elevated rank, much of the benefit is felt,
<PB N="599" REF="639">
and little of the inconveniency. But when the imitation of
the &s;ame manners de&s;cends, as it always will do, into the
ma&s;s of the people; when it advances the requi&s;ites of
living beyond what it adds to men's abilities to purcha&s;e
them, then it is, that luxury checks the formation
of families, in a degree that ought to alarm the public
fears.</P>
<P>3dly. That the condition mo&s;t favourable to popula|tion
is that of a laborious frugal people, mini&s;tring to
the demands of an opulent, luxurious nation; becau&s;e
this &s;ituation, whil&s;t it leaves them every advantage of
luxury, exempts them from the evils which naturally ac|company
its admi&s;&s;ion into any country.</P>
<P>II. Next to the mode of living, we are to con&s;ider
&startq;The quantity of provi&s;ion &s;uited to that mode, which
is either rai&s;ed in the country, or imported into it;&endq;&mdash;for
this is the order in which we a&s;&s;igned the cau&s;es of popu|lation,
and undertook to treat of them. Now, if we mea|&s;ure
the quantity of provi&s;ion by the number of human
bodies it will &s;upport in due health and vigour, this quan|tity,
the extent and quality of the &s;oil, out of which it is
rai&s;ed, being given, will depend greatly upon the <HI>kind.</HI> For
in&s;tance, a piece of ground capable of &s;upplying animal food
&s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of ten per&s;ons, would &s;u&s;tain,
at lea&s;t, the double of that number with grain, roots, and
milk. The fir&s;t re&s;ource of &s;avage life, is in the fle&s;h of
wild animals; hence the numbers among&s;t &s;avage nations,
<PB N="600" REF="640">
compared with the track of country which they occupy,
are univer&s;ally &s;mall, becau&s;e this &s;pecies of provi&s;ion
is, of all others, &s;upplied in the &s;lendere&s;t proportion.
The next &s;tep was the invention of pa&s;turage, or the rear|ing
of flocks and herds of tame animals. This alteration
added to the &s;tock of provi&s;ion greatly: but the la&s;t
and principal improvement was to follow, namely, tillage,
or the artificial production of corn, e&s;culent plants,
and roots. This di&s;covery, whil&s;t it changed the qua|lity
of human food, augmented the quantity in a va&s;t
proportion. So far as the &s;tate of population is governed
and limited by the quantity of provi&s;ion, perhaps, there
is no &s;ingle cau&s;e that affects it &s;o powerfully, as the kind,
and quality of food, which chance or u&s;age hath intro|duced
into a country. In England, notwith&s;tanding the
produce of the &s;oil has been, of late, con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ed,
by the inclo&s;ure of wa&s;tes, and the adoption, in
many places, of a more &s;ucce&s;sful hu&s;bandry, yet, we do
not ob&s;erve a corre&s;ponding addition to the number of
inhabitants; the rea&s;on of which appears to me to be,
the more general con&s;umption of animal food among&s;t
us. Many ranks of people, who&s;e ordinary diet was,
in the la&s;t century, prepared almo&s;t entirely from milk,
roots, and vegetables, now require every day a con&s;ide|rable
portion of the fle&s;h of animals. Hence, a great part
of the riche&s;t lands of the country are converted to
pa&s;turage. Much al&s;o of the bread corn, which went
directly to the nouri&s;hment of human bodies, now only
contributes to it, by fattening the fle&s;h of &s;heep and
<PB N="601" REF="641">
oxen. The ma&s;s and volume of provi&s;ions are hereby
dimini&s;hed; and what is gained in the melioration of the
&s;oil is lo&s;t in the quality of the produce. This con&s;ide|ration
teaches us, that tillage, as an object of national
care and encouragement, is univer&s;ally preferable to pa&s;|turage;
becau&s;e, the <HI>kind</HI> of provi&s;ion, which it yields,
goes much farther in the &s;u&s;tentation of human life.
Tillage is al&s;o recommended by this additional advantage,
that it affords employment to a much more numerous
pea&s;antry. Indeed, pa&s;turage &s;eems to be the art of a
nation, either imperfectly civilized, as are many of the
tribes, which cultivate it, in the internal parts of A&s;ia;
or of a nation, like Spain, declining from its &s;ummit by
luxury and inactivity.</P>
<P>The kind and quality of the provi&s;ion, together with
the extent and capacity of the &s;oil, from which it is rai&s;ed,
being the &s;ame; the quantity procured will principally
depend upon two circum&s;tances, the <HI>ability</HI> of the occupier,
and the <HI>encouragement</HI> which he receives. The greate&s;t
misfortune of a country is an indigent tenantry. What|ever
be the native advantages of the &s;oil, or even the &s;kill
and indu&s;try of the occupier, the want of a &s;ufficient
capital confines every plan, as well as cripples and wea|kens
every operation of hu&s;bandry. This evil is felt,
where agriculture is accounted a &s;ervile, or mean employ|ment;
where farms are extremely &s;ubdivided, and badly
furni&s;hed with habitations; where lea&s;es are unknown,
or are of &s;hort or precarious duration. With re&s;pect to the
<PB N="602" REF="642">
<HI>encouragement</HI> of hu&s;bandry; in this, as in every other
employment, the true reward of indu&s;try is in the price
and &s;ale of the produce. The exclusive right to the pro|duce
is the only incitement which acts con&s;tantly and
univer&s;ally; the only &s;pring which keeps human labour
in motion. All, therefore, that the laws can do, is, to
&s;ecure this right to the occupier of the ground, that is,
to con&s;titute &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of tenure, that the full and
entire advantage of every improvement go to the benefit
of the improver; that, every man work for him&s;elf, and
not for another; and that no one &s;hare in the profit who
does not a&s;&s;i&s;t in the production. By the <HI>occupier</HI> I here
mean not &s;o much the per&s;on who performs the work, as
him, who directs the management, and procures the
labour: and I con&s;ider the whole profit as <HI>received</HI> by the
occupier, when the occupier is benefited by the whole
value of what is produced,, which is the ca&s;e with the
tenant who pays a fixed rent for the u&s;e of land, no le&s;s
than with the proprietor who holds it as his own. The one
has the &s;ame intere&s;t in the produce, and in the advantage
of every improvement, as the other. Likewi&s;e the pro|prietor,
though he grant out his e&s;tate to farm, may
be con&s;idered as the <HI>occupier,</HI> in&s;omuch as he regulates
the occupation by the choice, &s;uperintendency, and
encouragement of his tenants, by the di&s;po&s;ition of
his lands, by erecting buildings, providing accommoda|tions,
by pre&s;cribing conditions, or &s;upplying imple|ments
and materials of improvement; and is entitled,
by the rule of public expediency above mentioned, to
<PB N="603" REF="643">
receive, in the advance of his rent, a &s;hare of the
benefit which ari&s;es from the increa&s;ed produce of
his e&s;tate. The violation of this fundamental maxim of
agrarian policy con&s;titutes the chief objection to the hold|ing
of lands by the &s;tate; by-the king; by corporate
bodies; by private per&s;ons in right of their offices or
benefices. The inconveniency to the public ari&s;es not &s;o
much from the unalienable quality of lands thus holden
in perpetuity, as from hence, that proprietors of this
de&s;cription, &s;eldom contribute much either of attention
or expence to the cultivation of their e&s;tates, yet claim,
by the rent, a &s;hare in the profit of every improvement
that is made upon them. This complaint can only be
obviated by long lea&s;es at a fixed rent, which convey a
large portion of the intere&s;t to tho&s;e who actually conduct
the cultivation. The &s;ame objection is applicable to the
holding of lands by foreign proprietors, and in &s;ome de|gree,
to e&s;tates of too great extent being placed in the
&s;ame hands.</P>
<P>III. Be&s;ide the <HI>production</HI> of provi&s;ion, there remains to
be con&s;idered the DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;It is in vain, that
provi&s;ions abound in the country, unle&s;s I be able to ob|tain
a &s;hare of them. This reflection belongs to every
individual. The plenty of provi&s;ion produced, the quan|tity,
of the public &s;tock, affords &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to individuals,
and encouragement to the formation of families, only in
proportion as it is <HI>di&s;tributed,</HI> that is, in proportion as
the&s;e individuals are allowed to draw from it a &s;upply of
<PB N="604" REF="644">
their own wants. The <HI>di&s;tribution,</HI> therefore, becomes of equal
con&s;equence to population with the <HI>production.</HI> Now, there
is but one principle of di&s;tribution that can ever become uni|ver&s;al,
namely, the &startq;principle of exchange;&endq; or, in other
words, that every man have &s;omething to give in return
for what he wants. Bounty, however it may come in
aid of another principle, however it may occa&s;ionally qua|lify
the rigour, or &s;upply the imperfection of an e&s;tabli&s;hed
rule of di&s;tribution, can never it&s;elf become that rule
or principle; becau&s;e men will not work to give the pro|duce
of their labour away. Moreover the only equivalents
that can be offered in exchange for provi&s;ion are <HI>power</HI> and
<HI>labour.</HI> All property is <HI>power.</HI> What we call property
in land, is the <HI>power</HI> to u&s;e it, and to exclude others from
the u&s;e. Money is the repre&s;entative of <HI>power,</HI> becau&s;e
it is convertible into power; the value of it con&s;i&s;ts in
its faculty of procuring <HI>power</HI> over things and per&s;ons.
But <HI>power</HI> which re&s;ults from civil conventions, and of
this kind are what we call a man's fortune or e&s;tate, is
nece&s;&s;arily confined to a few, and is withal, &s;oon exhau&s;t|ed:
whereas the capacity of <HI>labour</HI> is every man's natural
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and compo&s;es a con&s;tant and renewing fund.
The hire, therefore, or produce of per&s;onal indu&s;try is
that, which, the bulk of every community mu&s;t bring to
market, in exchange for the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; in
other words, employment mu&s;t, in every country, be
the medium of di&s;tribution, and the &s;ource of &s;upply to
individuals. But when we con&s;ider the <HI>production</HI> and <HI>di&s;|tribution</HI>
of provi&s;ion, as di&s;tinct from, and independent
<PB N="605" REF="645">
of each other; when &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame quantity to be
produced, we enquire in what way, or according to what
rule, it may be <HI>di&s;tributed,</HI> we are led to a conception of
the &s;ubject not at all agreeable to truth and reality; for,
in truth and reality, though provi&s;ion mu&s;t be produced,
before it be di&s;tributed, yet the production depends, in a
great mea&s;ure, upon the di&s;tribution. The quantity of
provi&s;ion rai&s;ed out of the ground, &s;o far as the rai&s;ing
of it requires human art or labour, will evidently be
regulated by the demand&mdash;the demand, or, in other
words; the price and &s;ale, being that which alone rewards
the care, or excites the diligence of the hu&s;bandman.
But the &s;ale of provi&s;ion depends upon the number,
not of tho&s;e who want, but of tho&s;e who have &s;ome|thing
to offer in return for what they want; not of tho&s;e
who would con&s;ume, but of tho&s;e who can buy; that
is, upon the number of tho&s;e who have the fruits of &s;ome
other kind of indu&s;try, to tender in exchange for what they
&s;tand in need of from the productions of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>We &s;ee, therefore, the connection between population
and <HI>employment.</HI> Employment affects population
&startq;di|rectly,&endq;
as it affords the only medium of di&s;tribution, by
which individuals can obtain from the common &s;tock a
&s;upply for the wants of their families: it affects popula|lation
&startq;indirectly,&endq; as it augments the &s;tock it&s;elf of
provi&s;ion, in the only way by which the production of it
can be effectually encouraged, by furni&s;hing purcha&s;ers,
No man can purcha&s;e without an equivalent, and that
<PB N="606" REF="646">
equivalent, by the generality of the people, mu&s;t, in
every country, be derived from employment.</P>
<P>And upon this ba&s;is is founded the public benefit of
<HI>trade,</HI> that is to &s;ay, its &s;ub&s;erviency to population, in
which its only real utility con&s;its. Of that indu&s;try,
and of tho&s;e arts and branches of trade, which are em|ployed
in the production, conveyance, and preparation
of any principal &s;pecies of human food, as of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of the hu&s;bandman, the butcher, baker, brewer,
corn-merchant, &amp;c. we acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity: like|wi&s;e
of tho&s;e manufactures, which furni&s;h us with warm
cloathing, convenient habitations, dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, as
of the weaver, taylor, &s;mith, carpenter, &amp;c. we per|ceive,
(in climates, however, like ours, removed at a
di&s;tance from the &s;un,) the conducivene&s;s to popula|tion,
by their rendering human life more healthy, vigorous,
and comfortable. But not one half of the occupations,
which compo&s;e the trade of Europe, fail within either of
the&s;e de&s;criptions. Perhaps, two thirds of the manu|facturers
of England are employed upon articles of con|fe&s;&s;ed
luxury, ornament, or &s;plendor; in the &s;uperfluous
embelli&s;hment of &s;ome articles which are u&s;eful in their
kind, or upon others which have no conceivable u&s;e or
value, but what is founded in caprice, or fashion. What
can be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, or le&s;s connected with the &s;u&s;tentation
of human life, than the whole produce of the &s;ilk, lace,
and plate manufactory? yet, what multitudes labour in
the different branches of the&s;e arts! What can be ima|gined
<PB N="607" REF="647">
gined more capricious than the fondne&s;s for tobacco and
&s;nuff? yet, how many various occupations, and how
many thou&s;ands in each, are &s;et at work, in admini|&s;tring
to this frivolous gratification! Concerning trades of
this kind, and this kind comprehends more than half
of the trades that are exerci&s;ed, it may fairly be a&s;ked
&startq;how, &s;ince they add nothing to the &s;tock of provi&s;ion,
do they tend to encrea&s;e the number of the people.&endq; We
are taught to &s;ay of trade, &startq;that it maintains multitudes;&endq;
but by what means does it <HI>maintain</HI> them, when it
produces nothing upon which the &s;upport of human
life depends?&mdash;In like manner, with re&s;pect to foreign
commerce; of that merchandi&s;e which brings the nece&s;|&s;aries
of life into a country, which imports, for example,
corn, or cattle, or cloth, or fuel, we allow the ten|dency
to advance population, becau&s;e it increa&s;es the
&s;tock, of provi&s;ion, by which the people are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.
But this is &s;o little the effect of foreign commerce in our
own country, that, I believe, it may be affirmed of
Great Britain, what Bi&s;hop, <HI>Berkley,</HI> &s;aid of a neighbour|ing
i&s;land, that if it was encompa&s;&s;ed with a wall of bra&s;s
fifty cubits high, the country might maintain the &s;ame
number of inhabitants, that find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in it at pre&s;ent;
and that every nece&s;&s;ary, and even every real comfort and
accommodation of human life might be &s;upplied in as great
abundance as they are now. Here, therefore, as before,
we may fairly a&s;k, by what operation it is, that foreign
commerce, which brings into the country no one article of
<PB N="608" REF="648">
human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, promotes the multiplication of hu|man
life?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this enquiry will be contained in the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of another; viz.</P>
<P>Since the &s;oil will maintain many more than it can
employ, what mu&s;t be done, &s;uppo&s;ing the country to be
full, with the remainder of the inhabitants. They, who,
by the rules of partition, (and &s;ome &s;uch mu&s;t be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in every country,) are entitled to the land; and
they who, by their labour upon the &s;oil, acquire a right
in its produce, will not part with their property for no|thing;
or rather, they will no longer rai&s;e from the &s;oil
what they can neither u&s;e them&s;elves, nor exchange for
what they want. Or, la&s;tly, if the&s;e were willing to
di&s;tribute what they could &s;pare of the provi&s;ion, which
the ground yielded, to others, who had no &s;hare or con|cern
in the property or cultivation of it, yet, &s;till, the
mo&s;t enormous mi&s;chiefs would en&s;ue from great numbers
remaining unemployed. The idlene&s;s of one half of the
community would overwhelm the whole with confu&s;ion
and di&s;order. One only way pre&s;ents it&s;elf of removing
the difficulty which this que&s;tion &s;tates, and which is
&s;imply this; that they, who&s;e work is not wanted,
nor can be employed in the rai&s;ing of provi&s;ion out
of the ground, convert their hands and ingenuity to the
fabrication of articles, which may gratify, and requite
tho&s;e who are &s;o employed; or who, by the divi&s;ion of
<PB N="609" REF="649">
lands in the country, are entitled to the exclu&s;ive po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of
certain parts of them. By this contrivance
all things proceed well. The occupier of the ground
rai&s;es from it the utmo&s;t he can procure, becau&s;e he is
repaid for what he can &s;pare by &s;omething el&s;e, which he
wants, or with which he is plea&s;ed: the arti&s;t and manu|facturer,
though he have neither any property in the &s;oil,
nor any concern in its cultivation, is regularly &s;upplied
with the produce, becau&s;e he gives, in exchange for what
he &s;tands in need of, &s;omething, upon which the receiver
places an equal value: and the community is kept quiet,
whil&s;t both &s;ides are engaged in their re&s;pective occupations.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of one half of
mankind is, to &s;et the other half at work; that is, to pro|vide
articles, which, by tempting the de&s;ires, may &s;timu|mulate
the indu&s;try, and call forth the activity of tho&s;e,
upon the exertion of who&s;e indu&s;try, and the application
of who&s;e faculties, the production of human provi&s;ion de|pends.
A certain portion only of human labour is, or can be
<HI>productive;</HI> the re&s;t is <HI>in&s;trumental</HI>&mdash;both equally nece&s;&s;ary,
tho' the one have no other object than to excite the other.
It appears, al&s;o, that it &s;ignifies nothing as to the main
purpo&s;e of trade, how &s;uperfluous the articles which it
furni&s;hes are; whether the want of them be real or ima|ginary,
founded in nature, or in opinion, in fa&s;hion, ha|bit,
or emulation: it is enough that they be actually de|&s;ired
and &s;ought after. Flouri&s;hing cities are rai&s;ed and
&s;upported by trading in tobacco: populous towns &s;ub&s;i&s;t
by the manufactory of ribbons. A watch may be a very
<PB N="610" REF="650">
unnece&s;&s;ary appendage to the dre&s;s of a pea&s;ant: yet if the
pea&s;ant will till the ground in order to obtain a watch,
the true de&s;ign of trade is an&s;wered; and the watch|maker,
whil&s;t he poli&s;hes the ca&s;e, or files the wheels of
his machine, is contributing to the production of corn as
effectually, tho' not &s;o directly, as if he handled the
&s;pade, or held the plough. The u&s;e of tobacco has been
mentioned already as an acknowledged &s;uperfluity, and
as affording a remarkable example of the caprice
of human appetites: yet, if the fi&s;herman will ply his
nets, or the mariner fetch rice from foreign countries, in
order to procure to him&s;elf this indulgence, the market is
&s;upplied with two important articles of provi&s;ion, by the
in&s;trumentality of a merchandi&s;e, which has no other
apparent u&s;e, than, the gratification of a vitiated palate.</P>
<P>But it may come to pa&s;s, that the hu&s;bandman, or
whoever he be, that is entitled to the produce of the
&s;oil, will no longer exchange it for what the manufac|turer
offers. He is already &s;upplied to the extent of
his de&s;ires. For in&s;tance, he wants no more cloth; he
will no longer therefore give the weaver corn, in return
for the produce of his looms; but he would readily
give it for tea or for wine. When the weaver finds this to
be the ca&s;e, he has nothing to do but to &s;end his cloth
abroad in exchange for tea or for wine, which he may
barter for that provi&s;ion, which the offer of his cloth
will no longer procure. The circulation is thus revived;
and the benefit, of the alteration is, that whereas the
<PB N="611" REF="651">
number of weavers, who could find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from
their employment, was before limited by the con&s;ump|tion
of cloth in the country, that number is now aug|mented,
in proportion to the demand for tea and for
wine. This is the principle of <HI>foreign</HI> commerce. In
the magnitude and complexity of the machine, the prin|ciple
of motion is &s;ometimes lo&s;t of unob&s;erved; but it
is always &s;imple and the &s;ame, to whatever extent it may
be diver&s;ified and enlarged in its operations.</P>
<P>The effect of trade upon agriculture, the proce&s;s of
which we have been endeavouring to de&s;cribe, is vi&s;ible
in the neighbourhood of trading towns, and in tho&s;e
di&s;tricts which carry on a communication with the mar|kets
of trading towns. The hu&s;bandmen are bu&s;y and
&s;kilful; the pea&s;antry laborious; the lands are managed
to the be&s;t advantage, and double the quantity of corn or
herbage, (articles which are ultimately converted into
human provi&s;ion,) rai&s;ed from it, of what the &s;ame &s;oil
yields in remoter and more neglected parts of the coun|try.
Wherever a thriving manufactory finds means to
e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf, a aew vegetation &s;prings up around it.
I believe it is true that agriculture never arrives at any
con&s;iderable, much le&s;s at its highe&s;t degree of perfec|tion,
where it is not connected with trade, that is, where
the demand for the produce is not increa&s;ed by the con|&s;umption
of trading cities. <HI>Let</HI> it be remembered then,
that agriculture is the immediate &s;ource of human pro|vi&s;ion;
that trade conduces to the production of provi&s;ion
<PB N="612" REF="652">
only as it promotes agriculture; that the whole &s;y&s;tem of
commerce, va&s;t and various as it is, hath no other public
importance than its &s;ub&s;erviency to this end.</P>
<P>We return to the proportion we laid down; &startq;that
employment univer&s;ally promotes population.&endq; From
this proportion it follows, that the comparative utility
of different branches of national commerce is mea&s;ured
by the number which each branch <HI>employs.</HI> Upon which
principle a &s;cale may ea&s;ily be con&s;tructed, which shall
a&s;&s;ign to the &s;everal kinds and divi&s;ions of foreign trade,
their re&s;pective degrees of public importance. In this
&s;cale the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place belongs to the exchange of wrought
goods for raw materials, as of broad cloth for raw &s;ilk;
cutlery for wool; clocks or watches for iron, flax, or
furs; becau&s;e this traffic provides a market for the
labour that has already been expended, at the &s;ame time
that it &s;upplies materials for new indu&s;try. Population
always flouri&s;hes where this &s;pecies of commerce obtains
to any con&s;iderable degree. It is the cau&s;e of employment,
or the certain indication. As it takes off the manufac|tures
of the country, it promotes employment; as it brings
in raw materials, it &s;uppo&s;es the exr&s;tence of manufac|tories
in the country, and a demand for the article when
manufactured. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> place is due to that com|merce,
which barters one &s;pecies of wrought goods for
another, as &s;tuffs for calicoes, &s;u&s;tians for cambrics,
leather for paper; or wrought goods for articles which
require no farther preparation, as for wine, oil, tea, &s;ugar,
<PB N="613" REF="653">
&amp;c. This al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ts employment, becau&s;e when the
country is &s;tocked with one kind of manufacture, it re|news
the demand by converting it into another; but it
is inferior to the former, as it promotes this end by one
&s;ide only of the bargain&mdash;by what it carries out. The
<HI>la&s;t,</HI> the lowe&s;t, and mo&s;t di&s;advantageous &s;pecies of com|merce,
is the exportation of raw materials in return for
wrought goods; as when wool is &s;ent abroad to purcha&s;e
velvets; hides or peltry to procure &s;hoes, hats, or linen
cloth. This trade is unfavourable to population, becau&s;e
it leaves no room or demand for employment, either in
what it carries out of the country, or in what it brings
into it. Its operation on both &s;ides is noxious. By its ex|ports
it dimini&s;hes the very &s;ubject upon which the indu&s;|try
of the inhabitants ought to be exerci&s;ed; by its imports
it le&s;&s;ens the encouragement of that indu&s;try, in the &s;ame
proportion that it &s;upplies the con&s;umption of the country
with the produce of foreign labour. Of different bran|ches
of manufactory, tho&s;e are, in their nature, the mo&s;t
beneficial, in which the price of the wrought article ex|ceeds
in the highe&s;t proportion that of the raw material;
for this exce&s;s mea&s;ures the quantity of employment, or;
in other words, the number of manufacturers which each
branch &s;u&s;tains. The produce of the ground is never the
mo&s;t advantageous article of foreign commerce. Under a
perfect &s;tate of public oeconomy, the &s;oil of the country
&s;hould be applied &s;olely to the rai&s;ing of provi&s;ion for the
inhabitants, and its trade be &s;upplied by their indu&s;try.
A nation will never reach its proper extent of population,
<PB N="614" REF="654">
&s;o long as its principal commerce con&s;i&s;ts in the exporta|tion
of corn or cattle; or even of wine, oil, tobacco,
madder, indigo, timber; becau&s;e the&s;e la&s;t articles take
up that &s;urface, which ought to be covered with the ma|terials
of human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be here however noticed, that we have all along
con&s;idered the inhabitants of a country as maintained by
the produce of the country; and that what we have &s;aid
is applicable with &s;trictne&s;s to this &s;uppo&s;ition alone.
The rea&s;oning, neverthele&s;s, may ea&s;ily be adapted to a
different ca&s;e; for when provi&s;ion is not produced, but
imported, what has been affirmed concerning provi&s;ion,
will be, in a great mea&s;ure, true of that article, whether
it be money, produce, or labour, which is exchanged for
provi&s;ion. Thus when the Dutch rai&s;e madder, and
exchange it for corn; or when the people of America
plant tobacco, and &s;end it to Europe for cloth; the culti|vation
of madder and tobacco become as nece&s;&s;ary to the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants, and, by con&s;equence, will
affect the &s;tate of population in the&s;e countries, as &s;en&s;ibly
as the actual production of food, or the manufactory of
raiment. In like manner, when the &s;ame inhabitants of
Holland earn money by the carriage of the produce of
one country to another, and with that money purcha&s;e the
provi&s;ion from abroad, which their own land is not
exten&s;ive enough to &s;upply, the increa&s;e or decline of
this trade will influence the numbers of the people no
<PB N="615" REF="655">
le&s;s than &s;imilar changes would do in the cultivation of
the &s;oil.</P>
<P>The few principles already e&s;tabli&s;hed will enable us
to de&s;cribe the effects, upon population, which may be
expected from the following important parts of national
practice and oeconomy.</P>
<P>I. EMIGRATION. <HI>Emigration</HI> may be either the over|flowing
of a country, or the de&s;ertion. As the increa&s;e of
the &s;pecies is indefinite, and the number of inhabitants,
which any given tract of &s;urface can &s;upport, finite, it is
evident that great numbers may be con&s;tantly leaving
the country, and yet the country remain con&s;tantly full.
Or whatever be the cau&s;e which invincibly limits the
population of a country, when the number of the people
have arrived at that limit, the progre&s;s of generation,
be&s;ide continuing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will &s;upply multitudes
for foreign emigration. In the&s;e two ca&s;es, emigration
neither indicates any political decay; nor, in truth,
dimini&s;hes the number of the people; nor ought to be
prohibited or di&s;couraged. But emigrants may relinqui&s;h
their country from a &s;en&s;e of in&s;ecurity, oppre&s;&s;ion,
annoyance and inconveniency. Neither, again, here is it
emigration which wa&s;tes the people, but the evils that
occa&s;ion it. It would be in vain, if it were practicable,
to confine the inhabitants at home; for the &s;ame cau&s;es
which drive them out of the country, would prevent
their multiplication if they remained in it. La&s;tly, men
<PB N="616" REF="656">
may be tempted to change their &s;ituation by the allure|ment
of a better climate, a more refined or luxurious
manner of living, by the pro&s;pect of wealth, or, &s;ome|times,
by the mere nominal advantage of higher wages
and prices. This cla&s;s of emigrants, with whom alone
the laws can interfere with effect, will never, I think,
be numerous. With the generality of a people, the
attachment of mankind to their homes and country, the
irk&s;omene&s;s of &s;eeking new habitations, and of living
among&s;t &s;trangers, will outweigh, &s;o long as men po&s;&s;e&s;s
the nece&s;&s;aries of life in &s;afety, or, at lea&s;t, &s;o long as
they can obtain a provi&s;ion for that mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
which the cla&s;s of citizens, to which they belong, are
accu&s;tomed to enjoy, all the inducements that the ad|vantages
of a foreign land can offer. There appear,
therefore, to be few ca&s;es in which emigration can be
prohibited with advantage to the &s;tate; it appears al&s;o
that emigration is an equivocal &s;ymptom, which will
probably accompany the decline of the political body,
but which <HI>may</HI> likewi&s;e attend a condition of perfect
health and vigour.</P>
<P>II. COLONIZATION. The only view under which our
&s;object will permit us to con&s;ider <HI>colonization,</HI> is in its
tendency to augment the population of the parent &s;tate
Suppo&s;e a fertile, but empty i&s;land, to lie within the reach
of a country, in which arts and manufactures are already
e&s;tabli&s;hed: &s;uppo&s;e a colony &s;ent out from &s;uch a coun|try
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, and to live there
<PB N="617" REF="657">
under the protection and authority of their native govern|ment;
the new &s;ettlers will naturally convert their
labour to the cultivation of the vacant &s;oil, and, with the
produce: of that &s;oil, will draw a &s;upply of manu|factures
from their countrymen at home. Whil&s;t the
inhabitants continue few, and the lands cheap and fre&s;h,
the coloni&s;ts will find it ea&s;ier and more profitable to
rai&s;e corn or rear cattle, and with corn and cattle to pur|cha&s;e
woollen cloth, for in&s;tance, or linen, than to &s;pin
or weave the&s;e articles for them&s;elves. The mother coun|try,
it is evident, will derive from this connection an
increa&s;e both of provi&s;ion and employment. It pro|motes
at once the two great requi&s;ites, upon which the
facility of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and, by con&s;equence, the &s;tate of
population depends, <HI>production</HI> and <HI>di&s;tribution.</HI> And this
in a manner the mo&s;t direct and beneficial. No &s;ituation
can be imagined more favourable to population, than that
of a country which works up goods for others, whil&s;t
the&s;e others are cultivating new tracts of land for them.
For as, in a genial climate, and from a fre&s;h &s;oil, the
labour of one man will rai&s;e provi&s;ion enough for ten;
it is manife&s;t that, where all are employed in agriculture,
much the greater part of the produce will be &s;pared from
the con&s;umption; and that three out of four, at lea&s;t, of
tho&s;e who are maintained by it, will re&s;ide in the coun|try
which receives the radundancy. When the new
country does not remit <HI>provi&s;ion</HI> to the old one, the
advantage is le&s;s; but &s;till the exportation of wrought
goods, by whatevever return they are paid for, advances
<PB N="618" REF="658">
population in that &s;econdary way, in which tho&s;e trades
promote it that are not employed in the production of
provi&s;ion. Whatever prejudice, therefore, &s;ome late
events have excited again&s;t &s;chemes of colonization, the
&s;y&s;tem it&s;elf is founded in apparent national utility, and
what is more, upon principles favourable to the common
intere&s;t of human nature: for it does not appear, by
what other method newly di&s;covered and unfrequented
countries can be peopled, or, during the infancy of their
e&s;tabli&s;hment, be protected or &s;upplied. The error which
we of this nation at pre&s;ent lament, &s;eems to have
con&s;i&s;ted not &s;o much in the original formation of colonies,
as in the &s;ub&s;equent management, in impo&s;ing re&s;tractions
too rigorous, or in continuing them too long; in not
perceiving the point of time, when the irre&s;i&s;tible order
and progre&s;s of human affairs demanded a change of laws
and policy.</P>
<P>III. MONEY. Where <HI>money</HI> abounds the people are gene|rally
numerous: yet, gold and &s;ilver neither feed nor clothe
mankind; nor are they in every country converted into
provi&s;ion by purcha&s;ing the nece&s;&s;aries of life at foreign
markets; nor do they, in any country, compo&s;e tho&s;e
articles of per&s;onal or dome&s;tic ornament, which certain
orders of the community have learnt to regard as
nece&s;&s;aries of life, and without the means of procuring
which they will not enter into family e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;at
lea&s;t, this property of the precious metals obtains in a
very &s;mall degree. The effect of money upon the number
<PB N="619" REF="659">
of the people, tho' vi&s;ible to ob&s;ervation, is not explained
without &s;ome difficulty. To under&s;tand this connection
properly, we mu&s;t return to the propo&s;ition, with which
we concluded our rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject, &startq;that
population is chiefly promoted by employment.&endq; Now
of employment money is partly the indication, and partly
the cau&s;e. The only way in which money regularly and
&s;pontaneou&s;ly <HI>flows into</HI> a country is in return for the
goods that are &s;ent out of it, or the work that is per|formed
by it; and the only way in which money is
<HI>retained</HI> in country is by the country &s;upplying, in a
great mea&s;ure, its own con&s;umption of manufactures.
Con&s;equently, the quantity of money found in a country,
denotes the amount of labour and employment: but
&s;till, employment, not money, is the cau&s;e of population;
the accumulation of money being merely a collateral
effect of the &s;ame cau&s;e, or a circum&s;tauce which accom|panies
the exi&s;tence, and mea&s;ures the operation of that
cau&s;e. And this is true of money, only whil&s;t it is ac|quired
by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants. The trea&s;ures,
which belong to a country by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mines, or
by the exaction of tribute from foreign dependencies, afford
no conclu&s;ion concerning the &s;tate of population. The
influx from the&s;e &s;ources may be immen&s;e, and yet the
country remain poor and ill peopled; of which we &s;ee
an egregious example in the condition of Spain, &s;ince the
acquisition of its South American dominions.</P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, money may become al&s;o a real and an oper|ative
<HI>cau&s;e</HI> of population, by acting as a &s;timulus to indu&s;try,
<PB N="620" REF="660">
and by facilitating the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The ca&s;e of
&s;ub&s;e&s;tence, and the encouragement of indu&s;try, depend
neither upon the price of provi&s;ion, nor upon the price
of labour, but upon the proportion which the one bears
to the other. Now the influx of money into a country
naturally tends to advance this proportion; that is, every
fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ion of money rai&s;es the price of labour before
it rai&s;es the price of provi&s;ion. When money is brought
from abroad, the per&s;ons, be they who they will, into
who&s;e hands it fir&s;t arrives, do not buy up provi&s;ion with
it, but apply it to the purcha&s;e and payment of labour.
If the &s;tate receive it, the &s;tate di&s;pen&s;es what it receives
among&s;t &s;oldiers, &s;ailors, artificers, engineers, &s;hip-wrights,
workmen; if private per&s;ons bring home trea&s;ures of
gold and &s;ilver, they u&s;ually expend them in the building
of hou&s;e, the improvement of e&s;tates, the purcha&s;e of
furniture, dre&s;s, equipage, in articles of luxury or &s;plen|dour:
if the merchant be enriched by the returns of his
foreign commerce, he applies his increa&s;ed capital to the
enlargement of his bu&s;ine&s;s at home. The money ere|long
comes to market for provi&s;ion, but it comes thither
through the hands of the manufacturer, the arti&s;t, the
hu&s;bandman and labourer. Its effect, therefore, upon the
price of art and labour will <HI>precede</HI> its effect upon the price
of provi&s;ion; and, during the interval between one effect
and the other, the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence will be multiplied
and facilitated, as well as indu&s;try be excited by new
rewards. When the greater plenty of money in circu|lation
has produced an advance in the price of provi&s;ion,
<PB N="621" REF="661">
corre&s;ponding to the advanced price of labour, its effect
cea&s;es. The labourer no longer gains any thing by the
increa&s;e of his wages. It is not, therefore, the quantity
of &s;pecie collected into a country, but the continual in|crea&s;e
of that quantity, from which the advantage ari&s;es
to employment and population. It is only the <HI>acce&s;&s;ion</HI>
of money which produces the effect, and it is only by
money con&s;tantly flowing into a country, that the effect
can be con&s;tant. Now whatever con&s;equence ari&s;es to
the country from the influx of money, the contrary may
be expected to follow from the diminution of its quantity;
and accordingly we find, that whatever cau&s;e drains off
the &s;pecie of a country, fa&s;ter than the &s;treams, which
feed it, can &s;upply, not only impoveri&s;hes the country, but
depopulates it. The knowledge and experience of this
effect has given occa&s;ion to a phra&s;e which occurs in
almo&s;t every di&s;cour&s;e upon commerce or politics. The
<HI>balance of trade</HI> with any foreign nation is &s;aid to be
again&s;t or in favour of a country &s;imply as it tends to
carry money out or to bring it in; that is, according
as the price of the imports exceeds or falls &s;hort of the
price of the exports. So invariably is the increa&s;e or
diminution of the &s;pecie of a country regarded as a te&s;t
of the public advantage or detriment, which ari&s;es from
any branch of its commerce.</P>
<P>IV. TAXATION. As <HI>taxes</HI> take nothing but of the
country; as they do not dimini&s;h the public &s;tock, only
vary the di&s;tribution of it, they are not nece&s;&s;arily preju|dicial
<PB N="622" REF="662">
to population. If the &s;tate exact money from
certain members of the community, &s;he di&s;pen&s;es it al&s;o
among&s;t other members of the &s;ame community. They
who contribute to the revenue, and they who are &s;up|ported
or benefited by the expences of government, are
to be placed one again&s;t the other; and whil&s;t what the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of one part is profited by receiving, compen|&s;ates
for what that of the other &s;uffers by paying, the
common fund of the &s;ociety is not le&s;&s;ened. This is
true: but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that although the &s;um di&s;|tributed
by the &s;tate be always <HI>equal</HI> to the &s;um collected
from the people, yet the gain and lo&s;s to the means of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence may be very <HI>unequal;</HI> and the balance will
remain on the wrong or the right &s;ide of the account,
according as the money pa&s;&s;es by taxation from the
indu&s;trious to the idle, from the many to the few,
from tho&s;e who want to tho&s;e who abound, or in a
contrary direction. For in&s;tance, a tax upon coaches,
to be laid out in the repair of roads, would probably
improve the population of a neighbourhood; a tax upon
cottages to be ultimately expended in the purcha&s;e and
&s;upport of coaches would certainly dimini&s;h it. In like
manner, a tax upon wine or tea, di&s;tributed in bounties
to fi&s;hermen or hu&s;bandmen, would augment the pro|vi&s;ion
of a country; a tax upon fisheries and hu&s;bandry,
however indirect or concealed, to be converted, when
rai&s;ed, to the procuring of wine or tea for the idle and
opulent, would naturally impair the public &s;tock. The
effect therefore of taxes upon the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="623" REF="663">
depends not &s;o much upon the amount of the &s;um levied, as
upon the object of the tax, and the application. Taxes
likewi&s;e may be &s;o adju&s;ted as to conduce to the re&s;traint
of luxury, and the correction of vice; to the encourage|ment
of indu&s;try, trade, agriculture and marriage. Taxes
thus contrived become rewards and penalties; not only
&s;ources of revenue, but in&s;truments of police. Vices
indeed them&s;elves cannot be taxed without holding forth
&s;uch a conditional toleration of them as to de&s;troy men's
perception of their guilt; but the materials and incen|tives
of vice may. Although, for in&s;tance, drunkenne&s;s
would be, on this account, an unfit object of taxation,
yet public-hou&s;es and &s;pirituous liquors are very properly
&s;ubjected to heavy impo&s;ts.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, although it may be true, that taxes can|not
be pronounced to be detrimental to population, by
any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in their nature; and though, under
&s;ome modifications, and when urged only to a certain
extent, they may even operate in favour of it; yet it will be found, in a great plurality of the in&s;tances, in which they are
impo&s;ed, that their tendency is noxious. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed
that nine families inhabit a neighbourhood, each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
barely the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or of that mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
which cu&s;tom hath e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t them; let a tenth
family be quartered upon the&s;e, to be &s;upported by a
tax rai&s;ed from the nine; or rather let one of the nine
have his income augmented by a &s;imilar deduction from
the incomes of the re&s;t: in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, it is
<PB N="624" REF="664">
evident that the whole di&s;trict would be broken up. For
as the entire income of each is &s;uppo&s;ed to be barely &s;uffi|cient
for the e&s;tabli&s;hment which it maintains, a deduction
of any part de&s;troys that e&s;tabli&s;hment. Now it is no
an&s;wer to this objection, it is no apology for the grievance,
to &s;ay, that nothing is taken out of the neighbourhood;
that the common &s;tock is not dimini&s;hed. The mi&s;|chief
is done by deranging the di&s;tribution. Nor, again,
is the luxury of one family, or even the maintenance of
an additional family, a recompence to the country for
the ruin of nine others. Nor, la&s;tly, will it alter the
effect, though it may conceal the cau&s;e, that the contri|bution,
in&s;tead of being levied directly upon each day's
wages, is mixed up in the price of &s;ome article of
con&s;tant u&s;e and con&s;umption; as in a tax upon candles,
malt, leather, or fuel. This example illu&s;trates the
tendency of taxes to ob&s;truct &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the mi|nute&s;t
degree of this ob&s;truction will be felt in the
formation of families. The example indeed forms an
extreme ca&s;e: the evil is magnified, in order to ren|der
its operation di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible. In real life,
families may not be broken up, or forced from their ha|bitation,
hou&s;es be quitted, or countries &s;uddenly de|&s;erted,
in con&s;equence of any new impo&s;ition whatever;
but marriages will become gradually le&s;s frequent.</P>
<P>It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary however to di&s;tingui&s;h between the
operation of a new tax, and the effect of taxes which
have been long e&s;tabli&s;hed. In the cour&s;e of circulation
the money may flow back to the hands from which it
<PB N="625" REF="665">
was taken. The proportion between the &s;upply and the
expence of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which had been di&s;turbed by the
tax, may at length recover it&s;elf again. In the in&s;tance
ju&s;t now &s;tated, the addition, of a tenth family to the
neighbourhood, or the enlarged expences of one of the
nine, may, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, &s;o advance the profits,
or increa&s;e the employment of the re&s;t, as to make full
re&s;titution for the &s;hare of their property, of which it
deprives them: or, what is more likely to happen, a
reduction may take place in their mode of living, &s;uited
to the abridgment of their incomes. Yet &s;till the ulti|mate
and permanent effect of taxation, tho' di&s;tingui&s;h|able
from the impre&s;&s;ion of a new tax, is generally adver&s;e
to population. The <HI>proportion</HI> above &s;poken of, can only
be re&s;tored by one &s;ide or other of this alternative; by
the people either contracting their wants, which at the
&s;ame time dimini&s;hes con&s;umption and employment; or
by rai&s;ing the price of labour, which nece&s;&s;arily adding
to the price of the productions and manufactures of the
country, checks their &s;ale at foreign markets. A nation,
which is burthened with taxes, mu&s;t always be under&s;old
by a nation which is free from them, unle&s;s the difference
be made up by &s;ome &s;ingular advantage of climate, &s;oil,
&s;kill, or indu&s;try. This quality belongs to all taxes,
which affect the ma&s;s of the community, even when
impo&s;ed upon the propere&s;t objects, and applied to the
faire&s;t purpo&s;es. But abu&s;es are in&s;eparable from
the di&s;po&s;al of public money. As government is u&s;ually
admini&s;tred, the produce of public taxes is expended upon
<PB N="624" REF="666">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="625" REF="667">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="626" REF="668">
a train of gentry, in the maintaining of pomp, or in the
purcha&s;e of influence. The conver&s;ion of property, which
taxes effectuate, when they are employed in this manner,
is attended with obvious evils. It takes from the in|du&s;trious
to give to the idle; it increa&s;es the number of
the latter; it tends to accumulation; it &s;acrifices the
conveniency of many to the luxury of a few; it makes
no return to the people, from whom the tax is drawn,
that is &s;atisfactory or intelligible; it encourages no acti|vity
that is u&s;eful or productive.</P>
<P>The &s;um to be rai&s;ed being &s;ettled, a wi&s;e &s;tate&s;man will
contrive his taxes principally with a view to their effect
upon <HI>population,</HI> that is, he will &s;o adju&s;t them, as to give
the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible ob&s;truction to tho&s;e means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
by which the ma&s;s of the community are actually
maintained. We are accu&s;tomed to an opinion that a
tax, to be just, ought to be accurately proportioned to
the circum&s;tances of the per&s;ons who pay it. But upon
what, it might be a&s;ked; is this opinion founded; unle&s;s it
could be &s;hown that &s;uch a proportion interferes the lea&s;t
with the general conveniency of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: whereas I
&s;hould rather believe, that a tax, con&s;tructed with a view
to that conveniency, ought to ri&s;e upon the different
cla&s;&s;es of the community, in a much higher ratio than
the &s;imple proportion of their incomes. The point to
be regarded, is not what men have, but what they can
&s;pare; and it is evident that a man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a thou|&s;and
pounds a year, can more ea&s;ily give up a hundred,
<PB N="627" REF="669">
than a man with a hundred pounds a year can part with
ten; that is, tho&s;e habits of life which are rea&s;onable
and innocent, and upon the ability to continue which
the formation of families depends, will be much le&s;s
affected by the one deduction than the other: it is &s;till
more evident, that a man of a hundred pounds a year
would not be &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by a
demand from him often pounds, as a man of ten pounds
a year would be by the lo&s;s of one: to which we mu&s;t
add, that the population of every country being reple|ni&s;hed
by the marriages of the lowe&s;t ranks of the
&s;ociety, their accommodation and relief becomes of more
importance to the &s;tate, than the conveniency of any
higher but le&s;s numerous order of its citizens. But
whatever be the proportion which public expediency
directs, whether the &s;imple the duplicate, or any higher
or intermediate proportion of men's incomes, it can
never be attained by any <HI>&s;ingle</HI> tax; as no &s;ingle object
of taxation can be found, which mea&s;ures the ability of
the &s;ubject with &s;ufficient generality and exactne&s;s. It
is only by a &s;y&s;tem and variety of taxes, mutually ba|lancing
and equali&s;ing one another, that a due propor|tion
can be pre&s;erved. For in&s;tance, if a tax upon lands
pre&s;s with greater hard&s;hip upon tho&s;e who live in the
country, it may be properly counterpoi&s;ed by a tax upon
the rent of hou&s;es, which will affect principally the in|habitants
of great towns. Di&s;tinctions may al&s;o be framed
in &s;ome taxes, which &s;hall allow abatements or exemp|tions
to married per&s;ons; to improvers of the &s;oil; to
<PB N="628" REF="670">
particular modes of cultivation, as to tillage in preference
to pa&s;turage; and in general to that indu&s;try which
is immediately <HI>productive,</HI> in preference to that which is
only <HI>in&s;trumental;</HI> but above all, which may leave the
heavie&s;t part of the burthen upon the methods, whatever
they be, of acquiring wealth without indu&s;try, or even,
of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in idlene&s;s</P>
<P>V. EXPORTATION OF BREAD-CORN. Nothing &s;eems to
have a more po&s;itive tendency to reduce the number of the
people, than the &s;ending abroad part of the provi&s;ion by
which they are maintained; yet this has been the policy
of legi&s;lators very &s;tudious of the improvement of their
country. In order to reconcile our&s;elves to a practice,
which appears to militate with the chief intere&s;t, that is,
with the population of the country that adopts it, we
mu&s;t be reminded of a maxim which belongs to the pro|ductions
both of nature and art, &startq;that it is impo&s;&s;ible
to have enough without a &s;uperfluity.&endq; The point of
&s;ufficiency cannot, in any ca&s;e, be &s;o exactly hit upon,
as to have nothing to &s;pare, yet never to want. This
is peculiarly true of bread-corn, of which the annual
increa&s;e is extremely variable. As it is nece&s;&s;ary that
the crop be adequate to the con&s;umption in a year of
&s;carcity, it mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, greatly exceed it in a
year of plenty. A redundancy therefore will occa&s;ionally
ari&s;e from the very care that is taken to &s;ecure the people
again&s;t the danger of want; and it is manife&s;t that the
exportation of this redundancy &s;ubtracts nothing from
<PB N="629" REF="671">
the number that can regularly be maintained by the
produce of the &s;oil. Moreover, as the exportation
of corn, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, is attended with
no direct injury to population, &s;o the benefits, which
indirectly ari&s;e to it from foreign commerce, belong
to this in common with other &s;pecies of trade; together
with the peculiar advantage of pre&s;enting a co&s;tant in|citement
to the &s;kill and indu&s;try of the hu&s;bandman, by
the promi&s;e of a certain &s;ale and an adequate price, under
every contingency of &s;ea&s;on and produce. There is ano|ther
&s;ituation, in which corn may not only be exported;
but in which the people can thrive by no other means;
that is, of a newly &s;ettled country, with a fertile &s;oil. The
exportation of a large proportion of the corn which a
country produces, proves, it is true, that the inhabitants
have not yet attained to the number which the country
is capable of maintaining; but it does not prove but they
may be ha&s;tening to this limit with the utmo&s;t practi|cable
celerity, which is the perfection to be &s;ought for in
a young e&s;tabli&s;hment. In all ca&s;es except the&s;e two,
and in the former of them to any greater degree than
what is nece&s;&s;ary to take off occa&s;ional redundancies, the
exportation of corn is either it&s;elf noxious to population,
or argues a defect of population ari&s;ing &s;rom &s;ome other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>VI. ABRIDGEMENT OF LABOUR. It has long been made
a que&s;tion whether tho&s;e mechanical contrivances, which
<HI>abridge labour,</HI> by performing the &s;ame work with fewer
<PB N="630" REF="672">
hands, be detrimental or not to the population of a coun|try.
From what has been delivered in preceding parts
of the chapter it will be evident, that this que&s;tion is
equivalent to another, whether &s;uch contrivances dimi|ni&s;h
or not the quantity of employment. Their fir&s;t and
mo&s;t obvious effect undoubtedly is this; becau&s;e if one
man be made to do what three men did before, two are
immediately di&s;charged: but if, by &s;ome more general
and remoter con&s;equence, they increa&s;e the demand for
work, or, what is the &s;ame thing, prevent the diminu|tion
of that demand, in a greater proportion than they
contract the number of hands by which it is performed,
the quantity of employment, upon the whole, will gain
an addition. Upon which principle it may be ob&s;erved,
fir&s;tly, that whenever a mechanical invention &s;ucceeds
in one place, it is nece&s;&s;lary that it be imitated in every
other, where the &s;ame manufacture is carried on; for it
is manife&s;t, that he, who has the benefit of a conci&s;er
operation, will &s;oon outvie and under&s;ell a competitor
who continues to u&s;e a more circuitous labour. It is al&s;o
true, in the &s;econd place, that whoever fir&s;t di&s;cover or
adopt a mechanical improvement, will, for &s;ome time,
draw to them&s;elves an increa&s;e of employment; and that
this preference may continue even after the improvement
has become general: for, in every kind of trade, it is not only
a great but permanent advantage, to have once preoccupied
the public reputation. Thirdly, after every &s;uperiority
which might he derived from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret,
has
cea&s;ed, it may be well que&s;tioned, whether even then
<PB N="631" REF="673">
any lo&s;s can accrue to employment. The &s;ame money will
be &s;pared to the &s;ame article &s;till. Wherefore in
propor|tion
as it can be afforded at a lower price, by rea&s;on
of an
ea&s;ier or &s;horter proce&s;s in the manufacture, it will either
grow into more general u&s;e, or an improvement will take
place in the quality and fabric of the article, which will
demand a proportionable addition of hands. The number
of per&s;ons employed in the manufactory of &s;tockings has
not, I apprehend, decrea&s;ed, &s;ince the invention of &s;toc|king
mills. The amount of what is expended upon the
article after &s;ubtracting from it the price of the raw ma|terial,
and consequently what is paid for work in this
branch of our manufactories, is not le&s;s than it was before.
Goods of a finer texture are worn in the place of coar&s;er.
This is the change which the invention has produced,
and which compen&s;ates to the manufactory for every other
inconveniency. Add to which, that in the above, and in
almo&s;t every in&s;tance, an improvement which conduces
to the recommendation of a manufactory, either by the
cheapness or the quality of the goods, draws up after it
many dependent employments, in which no abbrevia|tion
has taken place.</P>
<P>From the rea&s;oning that has been pur&s;ued, and the vari|ous
con&s;iderations &s;uggeted in this chapter, a judgment
may, in &s;ome &s;ort, be formed, how far regulations of law
are in their nature capable of contributing to the &s;upport and advancement of population. I <HI>&s;ay how far,</HI> for, as in many
<PB N="632" REF="674">
&s;ubjects, &s;o e&s;pecially in tho&s;e which relate to commerce,
to plenty, to riches, and to the number of the people,
more is wont to be expected from laws, than laws can do.
Laws can only imperfectly re&s;train that di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of
manners, which, by dimini&s;hing the frequency of mar|riages,
impairs the very &s;ource of population. Laws can|not
regulate the wants of mankind, their mode of living,
or their de&s;ire of tho&s;e &s;uperfluities, which fa&s;hion, more
irre&s;i&s;tible than laws, has once introduced into general
u&s;e, or, in other words, has erected into nece&s;&s;aries of
life. Laws cannot induce men to enter into marriages,
when the expence of a family mu&s;t deprive them of that
&s;y&s;tem of accommodation, to which they have habituated
their expectations. Laws by their protection, by a&s;&s;uring
to the labourer the fruit and profit of his labour, may help
to make a people indu&s;trious; but without indu&s;try, the
laws cannot provide either &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or employment:
laws cannot make corn grow without toil and care; or
trade flouri&s;h without art and diligence. The expert,
laborious, hone&s;t workman, will be <HI>employed,</HI> in &s;pite of
all laws, in preference to the lazy, the un&s;kilful, the
fraudulent and eva&s;ive: and this is not more true of two
inhabitants of the &s;ame village, than it is of the people of
two different countries, which communicate either with
each other, or with the re&s;t of the world. The natural
ba&s;is of trade is rival&s;hip of quality and price; or which is
the &s;ame thing, of &s;kill and indu&s;try. Every attempt to
<HI>force</HI> trade by operation of law, that is, by compelling
per&s;ons to buy goods at one market, which they can obtain
<PB N="633" REF="675">
cheaper and better from another, is &s;ure to be either
eluded by the ince&s;&s;ant activity of private intere&s;t, or to
be fru&s;trated by retaliation. One half of the commercial
laws of many &s;tates are calculated merely to counteract
the re&s;tractions which have been impo&s;ed by other &s;tates.
Perhaps the only way, in which the interpo&s;ition of law
is &s;alutary in trade, is in the prevention of frauds.</P>
<P>Next to the indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ites of internal peace and &s;ecurity, the chief advantage, which can be derived
to population from the interference of law, appears to
me to con&s;i&s;t in the encouragement of <HI>agriculture.</HI> This,
at lea&s;t, is the direct way of increa&s;ing the number of the
people; every other mode being effectual only by its in|fluence
upon this. Now the principal expedient by which
&s;uch a purpo&s;e can be promoted, is to adju&s;t the laws of
property, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, to the two following rules:
fir&s;tly, &startq;to give to the occupier all the power over the
&s;oil which is nece&s;&s;ary for its perfect cultivation;&endq;&mdash;&s;econd|ly,
&startq;to a&s;&s;ign the whole profit of every improvement to
the per&s;ons by who&s;e activity it is carried on.&endq; What
we call property in land, as hath been ob&s;erved above, is
power over it. Now it is indifferent to the public, in
who&s;e hands this power re&s;ides, if it be rightly u&s;ed: it matters not to whom the land belongs, if it be well cul|tivated.
When we lament that great e&s;tates are often
united in the &s;ame hand, or complain that one man
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es what would be &s;ufficient for a thou&s;and, we &s;us|fer
our&s;elves to be mi&s;led by names. The owner of ten
<PB N="634" REF="676">
thou&s;and pounds a year <HI>con&s;umes</HI> little more of the produce
of the &s;oil than the owner of ten pound's a year. If the
cultivation be equal, the e&s;tate, in the hands of one great
lord, affords &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and employment to the &s;ame num|ber
of per&s;ons, as it would do, if it were divided among&s;t
a hundred proprietors. In like manner, we ought to
judge of the effect upon the public intere&s;t, which may
ari&s;e from lands being holden by the king, or by the &s;ub|ject;
by private per&s;ons, or by corporations; by lay men
or eccle&s;ia&s;tics; in fee or for life; by virtue of office, or
in right of inheritance, I do not mean that the&s;e varieties
make no difference, but I mean, that all the difference
they do make re&s;pects cultivation.</P>
<P>But there exi&s;t in this country conditions of tenure,
which condemn the land it&s;elf to perpetual &s;terility. Of
this kind is the right of <HI>common,</HI> which precludes each
proprietor from the improvement, or even the convenient
occupation of his e&s;tate, without, what &s;eldom can be
obtained, the eon&s;ent of many others. This tenure is
al&s;o u&s;ually embarra&s;&s;ed by the Interference of <HI>manerial</HI>
claims, under which it often happens that the &s;urface
belongs to one owner, and the &s;oil to another; &s;o that
neither owner can &s;tir a clod without the concurrence of his
partner in the property. In many manors, the tenant
is re&s;trained from granting lea&s;es beyond a &s;hort term
of years, which renders every plan of &s;olid and perma|nent
improvement impracticable. In the&s;e ca&s;es the
owner wants, what the fir&s;t rule of rational policy re|quires;
<PB N="635" REF="677">
&startq;&s;ufficient power over the &s;oil for its perfect culti|vation.&endq;
This power ought to be extended to him by
&s;ome ea&s;y and general law of enfranchi&s;ement, partition,
and inclo&s;ure, which, tho' compul&s;ory upon the lord or
the re&s;t of the tenants, whilf&s;t it has in view the meliora|tion
of the &s;oil, and tenders an equitable compen&s;ation
for every right that it takes away, is neither more arbi|trary,
nor more dangerous to the &s;tability of property, than
that which is done in the con&s;truction of roads, bridges,
embankments, navigable canals, and indeed almo&s;t every
public work, in which private owners of land are obliged
to accept that price for their property which an indifferent
jury may award. It may here however be proper to
ob&s;erve, that altho' the inclo&s;ure of wa&s;tes and pa&s;tures
be generally beneficial to population, yet the inclo&s;ure of
lands in tillage, in order to convert them into pa&s;tures,
is as generally hurtful.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, agriculture is di&s;couraged by every con|stitution
of landed property, which lets in tho&s;e, who
have no concern in the improvement, to a participation
of the profit. This objection is applicable to all &s;uch
cu&s;toms of manors as &s;ubject the proprietor, upon the
death of the lord, or tenant, or the alienation of the
e&s;tate, to a fine apportioned to the improved value of
the land. But of all in&s;titutions, which are, in this
way, adver&s;e to cultivation and improvement, none is &s;o
noxious as that of <HI>tithes.</HI> A claimant here enters into
the produce who contributed no a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever to
<PB N="636" REF="678">
the production. When years, perhaps, of care and toil
have matured an improvement; when the hu&s;bandman
&s;ees new crops ripening to his &s;kill and indu&s;try, the moment he is ready to put his &s;ickle to the grain, he
finds him&s;elf compelled to divide his harve&s;t with a
&s;tranger. Tithes are a tax not only upon indu&s;try, but
upon that indu&s;try which &s;eeds mankind; upon that
&s;pecies of exertion, which it is the aim of all wi&s;e laws
to cheri&s;h and promote; and to uphold and excite which,
compo&s;es, as we have &s;een, the main benefit that the
community receives from the whole &s;y&s;tem of trade, and
the &s;ucce&s;s of commerce. And together with the more
general inconveniency that attends the exaction of tithes,
there is this additional evil, in the mode at lea&s;t accord|ing
to which they are collected at pre&s;ent, that they ope|rate
as a bounty upon pa&s;turage. The burthen of the
tax falls with its chief, if not with its whole weight,
upon tillage; that is to &s;ay, upon that preci&s;e mode of
cultivation, which, as hath been &s;hown above, it is the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate to relieve and remunerate, in prefe|rence
to every other. No mea&s;ure, of &s;uch exten&s;ive
concern, appears to me &s;o practicable, nor any &s;ingle alte|ration
&s;o beneficial, as the conver&s;ion of tithes into corn
rents. This commutation, I am convinced, might be &s;o
adju&s;ted, as to &s;ecure to the tithe-holder, a complete and
perpetual equivalent for his intere&s;t, and to leave to indu&s;|try
its full operation and entire reward.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of War, and of Military E&s;tabli&s;hments.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE the Chri&s;tian &s;criptures de&s;cribe wars,
as what they are, as crimes or judgments, &s;ome
have been led to believe that it is unlawful for a Chri&s;tian
to bear arms. But it &s;hould be remembered, that it may
be nece&s;&s;ary for individuals to unite their force, and, for
this end, to re&s;ign them&s;elves to the direction of a com|mon
will; and yet it may be true, that that will is often
actuated by criminal motives, and often determined to
de&s;tructive purpo&s;es. Hence, although the origin of wars
be a&s;cribed in &s;cripture to the operation of lawle&s;s and
malignant pa&s;&s;ions;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James iv. 1.</NOTE> and tho' war it&s;elf be enumerated
the &s;ore&s;t calamities with which a land can be
<PB N="638" REF="680">
vi&s;ited, the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier is no where forbidden
or condemned. When the "&s;oldiers demanded of John
the Bapti&s;t, &startq;and what &s;hall we do?&endq; he &s;aid unto them,
&startq;do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ly, and be
content with your wages.&endq;<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 14.</NOTE> In which an&s;wer we do
not find that, in order to prepare them&s;elves for the
reception of the kingdom of God, it was required of &s;oldiers
to relinquish their profe&s;&s;ion, but only that they &s;hould be|ware
of the vices, of which that profe&s;&s;ion, it may be pre|&s;umed, was ju&s;tly accu&s;ed. The precept, &startq;be con|tent
with your wages,&endq; &s;uppo&s;ed them to continue in
their &s;ituation. It was of a Roman centurion that Chri&s;t
pronounced that memorable eulogy, &startq;I have not found &s;o
great faith no not in I&s;rael.&endq;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 9.</NOTE> The fir&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 1.</NOTE> gentile convert
who was received into the Chri&s;tian church, and to whom
the go&s;pel was imparted by the immediate and e&s;pecial
direction of Heaven, held the &s;ame &s;tation: and, in the
hi&s;tory of this tran&s;action, we discover not the smalle&s;t
intimation, that Cornelius upon becoming a Chri&s;tian quit|ted
the &s;ervice of the Roman legion; that his profe&s;&s;ion was
objected to, or his continuance in it con&s;idered as, in any
wi&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent with his new character.</P>
<P>In applying the principles of morality to the affairs of na|tions,
the difficulty which meets us ari&s;es from hence, that
the particular con&s;equence, &s;ometimes, appears to exceed the
<PB N="639" REF="681">
value of the general rule." In this circum&s;tance is found|ed
the only di&s;tinction that exi&s;ts between the ca&s;e of
independent &s;tates, and of independent individuals. In
the tran&s;actions of private per&s;ons, no advantage, that
re&s;ults from the breach of a general law of ju&s;tice, can
compen&s;ate to the public for the violation of the law:
in the concerns of empire, this may &s;ometimes be doubted.
Thus, that the faith of promi&s;es ought to be maintained,
as far as is lawful, and as far as was intended by the
parties, whatever inconveniency either of them may &s;uf|fer
by his fidelity, in the intercour&s;e of private life is
&s;eldom di&s;puted; becau&s;e it is evident to almo&s;t every
man who reflects upon the &s;ubject, that the common
happine&s;s gains more by the pre&s;ervation of the rule, than
it could do by the removal of the inconveniency. But
when the adherence to a public treaty would en&s;lave a
whole people, would block up &s;eas, rivers, or harbours;
depopulate cities, condemn fertile regions to eternal de|&s;olation,
cut off a country from its &s;ources of provi&s;ion,
or deprive it of tho&s;e commercial advantages, to which its
climate, produce, or &s;ituation naturally entitle it; the
magnitude of the particular evil induces us to call in
que&s;tion the obligation of the general rule. Moral phi|lo&s;ophy
furni&s;hes no preci&s;e &s;olution to the&s;e doubts.
She cannot pronounce that any rule of morality is &s;o
rigid as to bend to no exceptions; nor, on the other hand,
can &s;he comprize the&s;e exceptions within any previous
de&s;cription. She confe&s;&s;es that the obligation of every
law depends upon its ultimate utility; that this utility
<PB N="640" REF="682">
having a finite and determinate value, &s;ituations may be
feigned, and con&s;equently may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e, in which
the general tendency is outweighed by the enormity of
the particular mi&s;chief: but &s;he recalls, at the &s;ame
time, to the con&s;ideration of the enquirer, the almo&s;t
ine&s;timable importance, as of other general rules of rela|tive
ju&s;tice, &s;o e&s;pecially of national and per&s;onal fidelity;
the un&s;een, if not unbounded extent of the mi&s;chief,
which mu&s;t follow from the want of it; the danger of
leaving it to the &s;ufferer to decide upon the compari&s;on of
particular and general con&s;equences, and the &s;till greater
danger of &s;uch deci&s;ions being drawn into future pre|cedents.
If treaties, for in&s;tance, be no longer binding
than whil&s;t they are convenient, or until the inconve|niency
a&s;cend to a certain point which point mu&s;t be
fixed by the judgment, or rather the feelings of the
complaining party; or if &s;uch an opinion, after being
authorized by a few examples, come at length to prevail;
one and almo&s;t the only method of averting or clo&s;ing
the calamities of war, of either preventing, or putting a
&s;top to the de&s;truction of mankind, is lo&s;t to the world for
ever. We do not &s;ay that no evil can exceed this, nor
any po&s;&s;ible advantage compen&s;ate it; but we &s;ay that a
lo&s;s, which affects <HI>all,</HI> will &s;carcely be made up to the
common &s;tock of human happine&s;s, by any benefit that
can be procured to a &s;ingle nation, which, however re&s;pect|able
when compared with any other &s;ingle nation, bears
an incon&s;iderable proportion to the whole. The&s;e how|ever
are the principles upon which the calculation is to
<PB N="641" REF="683">
be formed. It is enough, in this place, to remark the
cau&s;e which produces the he&s;itation that we &s;ometimes feel,
in applying the rules of per&s;onal probity to the conduct of
nations.</P>
<P>As between individuals it is found impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain
every duty by an immediate reference to public utility,
not only becau&s;e &s;uch reference is oftentimes too remote
and ob&s;cure for the direction of private con&s;ciences, but
becau&s;e a multitude of ca&s;es ari&s;e, in which it is indiffer|ent
to the general intere&s;t by what rule men act, tho' it
be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they act by &s;ome con&s;tant and
known rule or other; and as for the&s;e rea&s;ons certain po|&s;itive
con&s;titutions are wont to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in every
&s;ociety, which, when e&s;tabli&s;hed, become as obligatory as
the original principles of natural ju&s;tice them&s;elves; &s;o,
likewi&s;e, it is between independent communities. Together
with tho&s;e maxims of univer&s;al equity which are common
to &s;tates and to individuals, and by which the rights and
conduct of the one as well as of the other ought to be
adju&s;ted, when they fall within the &s;cope and application
of &s;uch maxims; there exi&s;ts al&s;o among&s;t &s;overeigns a
&s;y&s;tem of artificial juri&s;prudence, under the name of the
<HI>law of nations.</HI> In this code are found the rules which
determine the right to vacant or newly di&s;covered countries;
tho&s;e which relate to the protection of fugitives, the pri|vileges
of emba&s;&s;adors, the condition and duties of neutra|lity,
the immunities of neutral &s;hips, ports, and coa&s;ts,
the di&s;tance from &s;hore to which the&s;e immunities extend,
<PB N="642" REF="684">
the di&s;tinction between free and contraband goods, and a
variety of &s;ubjects of the &s;ame kind. Concerning which
examples, and indeed the principal part of what is called the
<HI>jus gentium,</HI> it may be ob&s;erved, that the rules derive their
moral force, by which I mean the regard that ought to
be paid to them by the con&s;ciences of &s;overeigns, not
from their internal rea&s;onablene&s;s or ju&s;tice, for many of
them are perfectly arbitrary; nor yet from the authority
by which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed, for the greater part have
grown in&s;en&s;ibly into u&s;age without any public compact,
formal acknowledgment, or even known original; but
&s;imply from the fact of their being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the
general duty of conforming to e&s;tabli&s;hed rules upon
que&s;tions, and between parties, where nothing but po&s;itive
regulations can prevent di&s;putes, and where di&s;putes are
followed by &s;uch de&s;tructive con&s;equences. The fir&s;t of
the in&s;tances, which we have ju&s;t now enumerated, may
be &s;elected for the illu&s;tration of this remark. The
nations of Europe con&s;ider the &s;overeignty of newly di&s;|covered
countries as belonging to the prince or &s;tate who&s;e
&s;ubject makes the di&s;covery; and, in pur&s;uance of this
rule, it is u&s;ual for a navigator, who falls upon an un|known
&s;hore, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the name of his
&s;overeign at home, by erecting his &s;tandard, or di&s;playing
his flag upon a de&s;ert coa&s;t. Now nothing can be more
fanciful, or le&s;s &s;ub&s;tantiated by any con&s;iderations of
rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, than the right which &s;uch di&s;covery, or
the tran&s;ient occupation, and idle ceremony that accompany
it, confer upon the country of the di&s;coverer. Nor can
<PB N="643" REF="685">
any &s;tipulation be produced, by which the re&s;t of the
world have bound them&s;elves to &s;ubmit to this preten&s;ion.
Yet when we reflect that the claims to newly di&s;covered
countries can hardly be &s;ettled, between the different
nations that frequent them, without &s;ome po&s;itive rule
or other; that &s;uch claims, if left un&s;ettled, would
prove &s;ources of ruinous and fatal contentions; that the
rule already propo&s;ed, however arbitrary, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one
principal quality of a rule&mdash;determination and certainty;
above all that it is acquie&s;ced in, and that no one has
power to &s;ub&s;titute another, however he might contrive
a better, in its place: when we reflect upon the&s;e pro|perties
of the rule, or rather upon the&s;e con&s;equences of
rejecting its authority, we are led to a&s;cribe to it the vir|tue
and obligation of a precept of natural ju&s;tice, becau&s;e
we perceive in it that, which is the foundation of ju&s;tice
it&s;elf, public importance and utility. And a prince who
&s;hould di&s;pute this rule, for the want of regularity in its
formation, or of intelligible ju&s;tice in its principle, and by
&s;uch di&s;putes &s;hould di&s;turb the tranquillity of nations, and
at the &s;ame time lay the foundation of future di&s;turbances,
would be little le&s;s criminal, than he who breaks the public
peace by a violation of engagements to which he had him|&s;elf
con&s;ented, or by an attack upon tho&s;e national rights,
which are founded immediately in the law of nature, and
in the fir&s;t perceptions of equity. The &s;ame thing may be
repeated of the rules which the law of nations pre&s;cribes
in the other in&s;tances that were mentioned, namely, that
the ob&s;curity of their origin, or the arbitrarine&s;s of their
<PB N="644" REF="686">
principle, &s;ub&s;tracts nothing from the re&s;pect that is due
to them, when once e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>WAR, may be con&s;idered with a view to its <HI>cau&s;es</HI> and to
its <HI>conduct.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> cau&s;es of war are deliberate inva&s;ions of
right, and the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining &s;uch a balance of
power among&s;t neighbouring nations, as that no &s;ingle &s;tate,
or confederacy of &s;tates, be &s;trong enough to overwhelm
the re&s;t. The objects of ju&s;t war are precaution, defence,
or reparation. In a larger &s;en&s;e, every ju&s;t war is a <HI>de|fen&s;ive</HI>
war, ina&s;much as every ju&s;t war &s;uppo&s;es an injury
perpetrated, attempted, or feared.</P>
<P>The <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> cau&s;es, or <HI>unju&s;tifiable</HI> motives of war, are
either the family alliances, or the per&s;onal friend&s;hips, or
quarrels of princes; the internal di&s;putes which are
carried on in other nations; the ju&s;tice of other wars;
the exten&s;ion of territory, or of trade; the misfortunes
or accidental weakne&s;s of a neighbouring or rival nation.</P>
<P>There are <HI>two</HI> le&s;&s;ons of rational and &s;ober policy,
which, if it were po&s;&s;ible to inculcate into, the councils of
princes, would exclude many of the motives of war, and
al$ay that re&s;tle&s;s ambition which is con&s;tantly &s;tirring up
one part of mankind again&s;t another. The fir&s;t of the&s;e
le&s;&s;ons admoni&s;hes princes to &startq;place their glory and their
emulation, not in extent of territory, but in rai&s;ing the
<PB N="645" REF="687">
greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s out of a given territory.&endq;
The enlargement of territory by conque&s;t is not only not
a ju&s;t object of war, but in the greater part of the in|&s;tances
in which it is attempted, not even de&s;ireable. It
is certainly not de&s;ireable where it adds nothing to the
numbers, the enjoyments, or the &s;ecurity of the con|querors.
What commonly is gained to a nation, by the
annexing of new dependencies, or the &s;ubjugation of
other countries to its dominion, but a wider frontier to
defend; more interfering claims to vindicate; more
quarrels, more enemies, more rebellions to encounter;
a greater force to keep up by &s;ea and land; more &s;ervices
to provide for, and more e&s;tabli&s;hments to pay? And in
order to draw from the&s;e acqui&s;itions &s;omething that may
make up for the charge of keeping them, a revenue is to
be extorted, or a monopoly to be enforced and watched,
at an expence which co&s;ts half their produce. Thus the
provinces are oppre&s;&s;ed, in order to pay for being ill
governed; and the original &s;tate is exhau&s;ted in main|taining
a feeble authority over di&s;contented &s;ubjects. No
a&s;&s;ignable portion of country is benefited by the change;
and if the &s;overeign appear to him&s;elf to be enriched or
&s;trengthened, when every part of his dominion is made
poorer and weaker than it was, it is probable that he is
deceived by appearances. Or were it true that the gran|deur
of the prince is magnified by tho&s;e exploits; that
glory which is purcha&s;ed, and that ambition which is
gratified by the di&s;tre&s;s of one country, without adding
to the happine&s;s of another, which, at the &s;ame time en|&s;laves
<PB N="646" REF="688">
the new, and impoveri&s;hes the ancient part of the
empire, by whatever names it may be known or flattered,
is an object of univer&s;al execration; and not more &s;o to
the vanqui&s;hed, than it is oftentimes to the very people
who&s;e armies or who&s;e trea&s;ures have atchieved the victory.</P>
<P>There are indeed, two ca&s;es in which the ex|ten&s;ion
of territory is of real advantage, and to both
parties. The fir&s;t is, where an empire thereby reaches to
the natural boundaries which divide it from the re&s;t of
the world. Thus the Briti&s;h channel is the natural
boundary which &s;eparates the nations of England and
France: and if France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any countries on this,
or England any cities or provinces on that &s;ide of the
&s;ea, the recovery of &s;uch towns and di&s;tricts to what may
be called their natural &s;overeign, tho' it might not be a
ju&s;t rea&s;on for commencing war, would be a proper u&s;e
to make of victory. The other ca&s;e is, where neighbour|ing
&s;tates being &s;everally too &s;mall and weak to defend
them&s;elves again&s;t the dangers that &s;urround them,
can only be &s;afe by a &s;trict and con&s;tant junction of their
&s;trength: here conque&s;t will effect the purpo&s;es of confe|deration
and alliance: and the union which it produces
is often more clo&s;e and permanent than that which
re&s;ults from voluntary a&s;&s;ociation. Thus, if the hep|tarchy
had continued in England, the different kingdoms
of it might have &s;eparately fallen a prey to foreign inva|&s;ion;
and although the intere&s;t and danger of one part of
the i&s;land was in truth common to every other part, it
might have been difficult to have circulated this per&s;ua|&s;ion
<PB N="647" REF="689">
among&s;t independent nations; or to have united
them in any regular or &s;teady oppo&s;ition to their conti|nental
enemies, had not the valour and fortune of an
enterpri&s;ing prince incorporated the whole into a &s;ingle
monarchy. Here the conquered gain as much by the
revolution as the conquerors. In like manner, and for
the &s;ame rea&s;on, when the two royal families of Spain
met together in one race of princes, and the &s;everal pro|vinces
of France had devolved into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
&s;ingle &s;overeign, it became un&s;afe for the inhabitants of
Great Britain any longer to remain under &s;eparate govern|ments.
The union of England and Scotland, which
transformed two quarrel&s;ome neighbours into one power|ful
empire, and which was fir&s;t brought about by the
cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and afterwards completed by amica|ble
convention, would have been a fortunate conclu&s;ion
of ho&s;tilities, had it been effected by the operations of
war. The&s;e two ca&s;es being admitted, namely, the ob|taining
of natural boundaries and barriers, and the in|cluding
under the &s;ame government tho&s;e who have a
common danger, and a common enemy to guard again&s;t;
I know not whether a third can be thought of, in which
the exten&s;ion of empire by conque&s;t is u&s;eful even to the
conquerors.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rule of prudence which ought to be re|commended
to tho&s;e who conduct the affairs of nations is,
&startq;never to pur&s;ue national <HI>honour</HI> as di&s;tinct from national <HI>in|tere&s;t.&endq;</HI>
This rule acknowledges that it is often nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="648" REF="690">
a&s;&s;ert the honour of a nation for the &s;ake of its intere&s;t. The
&s;pirit and courage of a people are &s;upported by flattering
their pride. Conce&s;&s;ions which betray too much of fear
or weakne&s;s, tho' they relate to points of mere ceremony,
invite demands and attacks of more &s;erious impor|tance.
Our rule allows all this, and directs only that,
when points of honour become &s;ubjects of contention
between &s;overeigns, or are likely to be made the occasions
of war, they be e&s;timated with a reference to utility,
and not <HI>by them&s;elves.</HI> &startq;The dignity of his crown,
the honour of his flag, the glory of his arms,&endq; in
the mouth of a prince, are &s;tately and impo&s;ing terms;
but the ideas they in&s;pire are in&s;atiable. It may be al|ways
glorious to conquer, whatever be the ju&s;tice of the
war, or the price of the victory. The dignity of a &s;overeign
may not permit him to recede from claims of homage and
re&s;pect, at whatever expence of national peace and happi|ne&s;s
they are to be maintained, however unju&s;t they may
have been in their original, or, in their continuance, how|ever
u&s;ele&s;s to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or mortifying and vexatious to
other &s;tates. The pur&s;uit of honour, when &s;et loo&s;e from
the admonitions of prudence, becomes in kings a wild and
romantic pa&s;&s;ion; eager to engage, and gathering fury
in its progre&s;s, it is checked by no difficulties, repelled by
no dangers: it forgets or de&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e con&s;iderations of
&s;afety, ea&s;e, wealth and plenty, which, in the eye of true
public wi&s;dom, compo&s;e the objects, to which the renown
of arms, the fame of victory, are only in&s;trumental and
&s;ubordinate. The pur&s;uit of intere&s;t, on the other hand,
<PB N="649" REF="691">
is a &s;ober principle; computes co&s;ts and con&s;equences; is
cautious of entering into war; &s;tops in time; when regu|lated
by tho&s;e univer&s;al maxims of relative ju&s;tice which
belong to the affairs of communities, as well as of private
per&s;ons, it is the right principle for nations to proceed by;
even when it tre&s;pa&s;&s;es upon the&s;e regulations, it is much
le&s;s dangerous, becau&s;e much more temperate than the
other.</P>
<P>II. The conduct of war.&mdash;If the cau&s;e and end of war
be ju&s;tifiable, all the means that appear nece&s;&s;ary to the
end are justifiable al&s;o. This is the principle which
defends tho&s;e extremities, to which the violence of war
u&s;ually proceeds; for &s;ince war is a conte&s;t by force
between parties who acknowledge no common &s;uperior,
and &s;ince it includes not in its idea the &s;uppo&s;ition of
any convention which &s;hould place limits to the opera|tions
of force, it has naturally no boundary, but that
in which force terminates, the de&s;truction of the
life again&s;t which the force is directed. Let it be
ob&s;erved however, that the licen&s;e of war authorizes no
acts of ho&s;tility but what are nece&s;&s;ary or conducive to
the end and object of the war. Gratuitous barbarities
borrow no excu&s;e from this plea. Of which kind is every
cruelty and every in&s;ult that &s;erves only to exa&s;perate
the &s;ufferings, or to incen&s;e the hatred of an enemy,
without weakening his &s;trength, or in any manner tend|ing
to procure his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as the &s;laughter of
captives, the &s;ubjecting them to indignities or torture,
<PB N="650" REF="692">
the violation of women, the profanation of temples, the
demolition of public buildings, libraries, &s;tatues, and in
general the de&s;truction or defacing of works that conduce
nothing to annoyance or defence The&s;e enormities are
prohibited not only by the practice of civilized nations,
but by the law of nature it&s;elf; as having, no proper
tendency to accelerate the termination or object of the
war; and as containing that, which in peace and war is
equally unju&s;tifiable, ultimate and gratuitous mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>There are other re&s;trictions impo&s;ed upon the conduct
of war, not by the law of nature primarily, but by the
<HI>laws of war</HI> fir&s;t, and by the law of nature as &s;econding,
and ratifying the laws of war. The laws of war are part
of the law of nations; and founded, as to their authority,
upon the &s;ame principle with the re&s;t of that code, name|ly,
upon the fact of their being e&s;tabli&s;hed, no matter
when or by whom; upon the expectation of their being
mutually ob&s;erved, in con&s;equence of that e&s;tabli&s;hment;
and upon the general utility which re&s;ults from &s;uch
ob&s;ervation. The binding force of the&s;e rules is the
greater, becau&s;e the regard that is paid to them mu&s;t be
univer&s;al or none. The breach of the rule can only
be puni&s;hed by the &s;ubver&s;ion of the rule it&s;elf. On
which account the whole mi&s;chief, that en&s;ues from the
lo&s;s of tho&s;e &s;alutary re&s;trictions, which &s;uch rules pre|&s;cribe,
is ju&s;tly chargeable upon the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or. To
this con&s;ideration may be referred the duty of refraining
in war from poi&s;on and from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. If the law of
<PB N="651" REF="693">
nature &s;imply be con&s;ulted, it may be difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
between the&s;e and other methods of de&s;truction,
which are practi&s;ed without &s;cruple by nations at war.
If it be lawful to kill an enemy at all, it &s;eems lawful to
do &s;o by one mode of death as well as by another; by a
do&s;e of poi&s;on, as by the point of a &s;word; by the hand
of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, as by the attack of an army: for if it be
&s;aid that one &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ault leaves to an enemy the
power of defending him&s;elf again&s;t it, and that the other
does not, it may be an&s;wered that we po&s;&s;e&s;s at lea&s;t the
&s;ame right to cut off an enemy's defence, that we have
to &s;eek his de&s;truction. In this manner might the
que&s;tion be debated, if there exi&s;ted no rule or law of war
upon the &s;ubject. But when we ob&s;erve that &s;uch
practices are at pre&s;ent excluded by the u&s;age and opi|nions
of civilized nations; that the fir&s;t recour&s;e to
them would be followed by in&s;tant retaliation; that the
mutual licen&s;e which &s;uch attempts mu&s;t introduce
would fill both &s;ides with the mi&s;ery of continual dread
and &s;u&s;picion, without adding to the &s;trength or &s;ucce&s;s
of either; that when the example came to be more gene|rally
imitated, which it &s;oon would be after the &s;enti|ment,
that condemns it, had been once broken in upon, it
would greatly aggravate the horrors and calamities of war,
and yet procure no &s;uperiority to any of the nations engag|ed
in it: when we view the&s;e effects, we join in the public
reprobation of &s;uch fatal expedients, as of the admi&s;&s;ion
among&s;t mankind of new and enormous evils without
nece&s;&s;ity or advantage. The law of nature, we &s;ee at
<PB N="652" REF="694">
length, forbids the&s;e innovations as &s;o many tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
of a beneficial general rule, actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>The licen&s;e of war then acknowledges two limitations:
it authorizes no ho&s;tilities which have not an apparent
tendency to effectuate the object of the war; it re&s;pects
tho&s;e po&s;itive laws which the cu&s;tom of nations hath
&s;anctified, and which, whil&s;t they are mutually con|formed
to, mitigate the calamities of war without weak|ening
its operations, or dimini&s;hing the power or &s;afety
of belligerent &s;tates.</P>
<P>Long and various experience &s;eems to have convinced
the nations of Europe that nothing but a <HI>&s;tanding army</HI>
can oppo&s;e a &s;tanding army, where the numbers on each
&s;ide bear any moderate proportion to one another. The
fir&s;t &s;tanding army that appeared in Europe after the fall
of the Roman legion, was that which was erected in
France by Charles VII. about the middle of the fifteenth
century. And that the in&s;titution hath &s;ince become
general, can only be attributed to the &s;uperiority and &s;ucce&s;s
which are every where ob&s;erved to attend it. The truth
is, the clo&s;ene&s;s, regularity, and quickne&s;s of their
movements; the unre&s;erved, in&s;tantaneous, and almo&s;t
mechanical obedience to orders; the &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal
honour, and the familiarity with danger, which belong
to a di&s;ciplined, veteran, and embodied &s;oldiery, give &s;uch
firmne&s;s and intrepidity to their approach, &s;uch weight
and execution to their attack, as are not to be with&s;tood
<PB N="653" REF="695">
by loo&s;e ranks of occa&s;ional and newly levied troops, who
are liable by their inexperience to di&s;order and confu&s;ion,
and in whom fear is con&s;tantly augmented by novelty
and &s;urprize. It is po&s;&s;ible that a <HI>militia,</HI> with a great
exce&s;s of numbers, and a ready &s;upply of recruits, may
&s;u&s;tain a defen&s;ive or a flying war again&s;t regular troops:
it is al&s;o true that any &s;ervice, which keeps &s;oldiers for a
while together, and inures them by little and little to the
habits of war, and the dangers of action, transforms them
in effect into a &s;tanding army: but upon this plan it may
be nece&s;&s;ary for almo&s;t a whole nation to go out to war to
repel an invader; be&s;ide that a people &s;o unprepared
mu&s;t always have the &s;eat, and with it the mi&s;eries
of war, at home, being utterly incapable of carrying their
operations into a foreign country.</P>
<P>From the acknowledged &s;uperiority of &s;tanding armies,
it follows, not only that it is un&s;afe for a nation to
di&s;band its regular troops, whil&s;t neighbouring kingdoms
retain theirs, but al&s;o that regular troops provide for
the public &s;ervice at the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence. I &s;uppo&s;e
a certain quantity of military &s;trength to be nece&s;&s;ary, and
I &s;ay that a &s;tanding army co&s;ts the community le&s;s than
any other e&s;tabli&s;hment which pre&s;ents to an enemy the
&s;ame force. The con&s;tant drudgery of low employments is
not only incompatible with any great degree of perfection
or expertne&s;s in the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier, but the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of a &s;oldier almo&s;t always unfits men for the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of regular occupations. Of three inhabitants of a
<PB N="654" REF="696">
village, it is better that one &s;hould addict him&s;elf entirely
to arms, and the other two &s;tay con&s;tantly at home to cul|tivate
the ground, than that all the three &s;hould mix the
avocations of a camp with the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry. By
the former arrangement the country gains one complete
&s;oldier, and two indu&s;trious hu&s;bandmen; from the lat|ter
it receives three raw militia-men, who are at the &s;ame
time three idle and profligate pea&s;ants. It &s;hould be con&s;i|dered
al&s;o that the emergencies of war wait not for &s;ea|&s;ons.
Where there is no &s;tanding army ready for imme|diate
&s;ervice, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to call the reaper from the
fields in harve&s;t, or the ploughman in &s;eed time; and the
provi&s;ion of a whole year may peri&s;h by the interruption of
one month's labour. A &s;tanding army, therefore, is not
only a more effectual, but a cheaper method of providing
for the public &s;afety, than any other, becau&s;e it adds more
than any other to the common &s;trength, and takes le&s;s
from that, which compo&s;es the wealth of a nation, its
&s;tock of productive indu&s;try.</P>
<P>There is yet another di&s;tinction between &s;tanding armies
and militias, which de&s;erves a more attentive considera|tion
than any that has been mentioned. When the
&s;tate relies for its defence upon a militia, it is nece&s;&s;ary
that arms be put into the hands of the people at large.
The militia it&s;elf mu&s;t be numerous, in proportion to the
want or inferiority of its di&s;cipline, and the imbecilities
or defects of its constitution. Moreover, as &s;uch a mili|tia
mu&s;t be &s;upplied by rotation, allotment, or &s;ome
<PB N="655" REF="697">
mode of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, whereby they, who have &s;erved a
certain time, are replaced by fre&s;h draughts from the
country, a much greater number will be in&s;tructed in the
u&s;e of arms, and will have been occasionally embodied
together, than are actually employed, or than are &s;up|po&s;ed
to be wanted at the &s;ame time. Now what effects
upon the civil condition of the country may be looked
for from this general diffu&s;ion of the military character,
becomes an enquiry of great importance and delicacy.
To me it appears doubtful, whether any government
can be long &s;ecure, where the people are acquainted with
the u&s;e of arms and accu&s;tomed to re&s;ort to them. Every
faction will find it&s;elf at the head of an army. Every
di&s;gu&s;t will excite commotion, and every commotion
become a civil war. Nothing perhaps can govern a
nation of armed citizens but that which governs an
army&mdash;de&s;poti&s;m. I do not mean that a regular go|vernment
would become de&s;potic by training up its &s;ub|jects
to the knowledge and exerci&s;e of arms, but that it
would ere long be forced to give way to de&s;poti&s;m in
&s;ome other &s;hape; and that the country would be liable,
to what is even wor&s;e than a &s;ettled and con&s;titutional
de&s;poti&s;m, to perpetual rebellions, and to perpetual revo|lutions;
to &s;hort and violent u&s;urpations; to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
tyranny of governors, rendered cruel and jealous
by the danger and in&s;tability of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame purpo&s;es of &s;trength and efficacy which
make a &s;tanding army nece&s;&s;ary at all, make it nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="656" REF="698">
in mixt governments, that this army be &s;ubmitted to the
management and direction of the prince. For however well
a popular council may be qualified for the offices of legi&s;la|tion,
it is altogether unfit for the conduct of war; in which
&s;ucce&s;s u&s;ually depends upon vigour and enterprize, upon
&s;ecre&s;y, di&s;patch, and unanimity, upon a quick percep|tion
of opportunities, and the power of &s;eizing every
opportunity immediately. It is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary that
the obedience of an army be as prompt and active as
po&s;&s;ible; for which rea&s;on it ought to be made an obe|dience
of will and emulation. Upon this con&s;ideration
is founded the expediency of leaving to the prince not
only the government and de&s;tination of the army, but the
appointment and promotion of its officers; becau&s;e a
de&s;ign is then alone likely to be executed with zeal
and fidelity, when the per&s;on who i&s;&s;ues the order
chu&s;es the in&s;truments, and rewards the &s;ervice. To
which we may &s;ubjoin that, in governments like ours,
if the direction and <HI>officering</HI> of the army were placed in
the hands of the democratic part of the con&s;titution, this
power, added to what they already po&s;&s;e&s;s, would &s;o
overbalance all that would be left of regal prerogative,
that little would remain of monarchy in the con&s;titution,
but the name and expence; nor would they probably
remain long.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we de&s;cribe, however, the advantages of &s;tanding
armies, we mu&s;t not conceal the danger. The&s;e proper|ties
of their con&s;titution, the &s;oldiery being &s;eparated in
<PB N="657" REF="699">
a great degree from the re&s;t of the community, their
being clo&s;ely linked among&s;t them&s;elves by habits of
&s;ociety and &s;ubordination, and the dependency of the
whole chain upon the will and favour of the prince,
however e&s;&s;ential they may be to the purpo&s;es for which
armies are kept up, give them an a&s;pect in no wi&s;e fa|vourable
to public liberty. This danger however is
dimini&s;hed by maintaining, upon all occa&s;ions, as
much alliance of intere&s;t, and as much intercour&s;e of
&s;entiment, between the military part of the nation and
the other orders of the people, as are con&s;i&s;tent with the
union and di&s;cipline of an army. For which purpo&s;e
the officers of the army, upon who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition towards
the commonwealth a great deal may depend &s;hould be
taken from the principal families of the country, and
at the &s;ame time al&s;o be encouraged to e&s;tabli&s;h in it
families of their own, as well as be admitted to &s;eats in
the &s;enate, to hereditary di&s;tinctions, and to all the civil
honours and privileges that are compatible with their
profe&s;&s;ion; which circum&s;tances of connection and &s;itu|ation
will give them &s;uch a &s;hare in the general rights of
the people, and &s;o engage their inclinations on the &s;ide of
public liberty, as to afford a rea&s;onable &s;ecurity that they
cannot be brought, by any promi&s;es of per&s;onal aggran|di&s;ement,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of mea&s;ures which
might en&s;lave their po&s;terity, their kindred, and their
country.&mdash;</P>
