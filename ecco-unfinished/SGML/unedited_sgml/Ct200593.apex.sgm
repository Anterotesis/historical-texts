<HEAD>THE Secret HISTORY OF THE <HI>October</HI> CLUB:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With &s;ome Friendly Characters of the Illu&s;trious Members of that Honourable SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the Original of the Name by which the&s;e Hone&s;t Gen|tlemen have thought fit to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t of their Neighbours, might be diverting enough; and the World &s;eems very curious to enquire into the begin|ning of a thing which they have heard more of, and know le&s;s of, than of mo&s;t Publick things now upon the Stage. Yet as it &s;eems rather an Acci|dent than an E&s;&s;ential to the thing it &s;elf, we &s;hall not amu&s;e the World with a particular Enquiry of that Nature, but leave it to fall in with other things
<PB N="2" REF="3">
as mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily it will in the Cour&s;e of the Story.</P>
<P>We might carry back the Enquiry we are now upon to the beginning, not of the pre&s;ent Reign, but even to the Re|volution, nay, even to the beginning of our Unhappy Divi&s;ions in this Na|tion into Parties; the con&s;equence of which Enquiry, would be chiefly to &s;hew, how in every Reign, in every Age, nay almo&s;t in every Year, New Parties have ri&s;en up among us; di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by New Names, tho' perhaps, ea&s;ily to be re&s;olved into the &s;ame Ori|ginal Grand Divi&s;ion which the late King <HI>James</HI> left this Nation in, when former petty Divi&s;ions, being as it were &s;tifled, &s;ome thought Buryed in the Great Revolution Strife, the Nation &s;eem'd only divided into the Two great Parties, <HI>the&s;e</HI> Patrons of <HI>Liberty, tho&s;e</HI> of <HI>Slavery.</HI></P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary for the continu|ing a Chain of Story, and to &s;hew you the Connexion of things pre&s;ent, with things pa&s;t, or Con&s;equences with their Cau&s;es, to enter here into &s;ome little Hi&s;torical Account of the Changes from that time, how they have depended upon one another, as Links in a Chain, to the pre&s;ent period of things; and this &s;hall be done with Brevity and Plainne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
No &s;ooner was the Blow &s;truck in <HI>Britain,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> being Fled, the Convention of E&s;tates had declared the Throne Vacant, and had the placing the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> in the Seat of the Government in their view; but a Third Party ro&s;e up and violently oppo&s;ed it. We knew not what at fir&s;t to call the&s;e People, neither did they give them&s;elves any Name; tho' they might have been call'd <HI>October-Men</HI> at that time, as truly and with as ju&s;t a Derivation as any now bear that Name: They were as much Enemies to the Tyranny and Di&s;pen&s;ing&punc; Power of King <HI>James,</HI> as other Men: They were Zealous to prevent the Inva&s;ion of Po|pery: many, yea mo&s;t of them, had joyn'd in the taking up Arms again&s;t their Lawful Sovereign; and in the In|vitation given to a Foreign Prince to come over in a Ho&s;tile manner, and In|vade their King, in order to put a &s;top to his De&s;igns again&s;t the Liberty and Religion of their Country: Whether they did it from a clear view of the Su|premacy of the Peoples Right to tho&s;e Laws, or whether <HI>Nature had rebelled in them again&s;t Principle,</HI> Authors have not agreed about it, nor &s;hall we at|tempt to &s;olve that Difficulty at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
Be that as it will, the&s;e Gentlemen carryed their oppo&s;ition to the Abdica|tion, a great length; they Voted again&s;t Declaring the Throne Vacant; they Prote&s;ted again&s;t the filling up that Va|cancy; they Di&s;own'd the Entailing the Crown upon the Per&s;ons mentioned in the Act of Settlement; and many of them refu&s;ed to acknowledge, or take the Oaths of Allegiance to the King and Queen. It is true, mo&s;t of them in time having con&s;ider'd of the matter, and the Terms of the Oath rather requi|ring a Pa&s;&s;ive than an Active Allegi|ance, they came into the Oaths; &s;ome upon the Di&s;tinctions of a Right <HI>De Fa|cto</HI> and a Right <HI>De Jure:</HI> Some moved by Intere&s;t and Advantage; &s;ome with Wicked Re&s;erves of their Allegiance to King <HI>James;</HI> &s;ome one way, &s;ome ano|ther; and &s;ome <HI>by far the Hone&s;ter,</HI> &s;tood out to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be too long to give you the Arguments here which were u&s;ed on both &s;ides, to per&s;wade a Complyance, or to ju&s;tify a Refu&s;al. We may &s;end the LAITY to Examine the Doctrines of Divine Right, Indefeazible Title, and the Illegality of any Human Power, Su|per&s;eding the Right of the King; that he derives from, and is only accountable to God; that as by the Law, the King
<PB N="5" REF="6">
can do no Wrong, &s;o he can forfeit no Right; <HI>and the like:</HI> Arguments often exploded by the practice of tho&s;e that have made the loude&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion of them; yet that are &s;till carryed on, and may be now call'd <HI>October Principles,</HI> as being again e&s;pou&s;ed by the Gentlemen, who we are coming to talk of. As to the CLERGY, we may refer them to the Learned Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> who after he had by Example and Arguments, led many warm <HI>but well meaning</HI> Men, to e&s;pou&s;e the &s;ame Principle, and lo&s;e their Livings for adhering to it, left them in the Li&s;t of State Martyrs, but excu&s;ed him&s;elf; and profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a Con|vert to Dr. <HI>Overall,</HI> fac'd about, took the Oaths, and &s;av'd a good Living, af|ter he had ruin'd half a Province of the Clergy.</P>
<P>From this Original, &s;prung the fir&s;t unhappy Di&s;tinction among us, <HI>&s;ince the Revolution,</HI> known by the Name of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Name of Di&s;tin|ction, <HI>Non-Ju|rors.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> but to our great Misfortune it did not end here; For as we noted above, many of the complying Gentle|men retain'd their Principles, tho' they had for the Rea&s;ons above&s;aid, taken the Oaths; And in &s;pight of the Sacred Obligation, they went on in all Com|panies, on all Occa&s;ions, and with un|u&s;ual Openne&s;s, to appear for the Inte|re&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and Party of King <HI>James:</HI> they In|&s;ulted, Ridicul'd, Bought, Sold and Be|tray'd, both the King, his Intere&s;t, his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>The World having in no Age been u&s;ed to a People of &s;uch Amphibious Politicks as the&s;e, Men were at a lo&s;s what to call them a great while: <HI>Non-Jurors they were not,</HI> for no Parliament could frame Oaths of any kind, but they would take them: They &s;ubmitted to Oaths of Allegiance, Recognition, A&s;&s;ociation, Abjuration, A&s;&s;urance, and every thing you plea&s;ed, <HI>Williamites</HI> they could not be, King <HI>William</HI> was their Aver&s;ion, and they would Drink King <HI>James</HI>'s Health as openly, as if they had &s;een him upon the Throne: From the&s;e Practices, they came to di|&s;tingui&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Second Di&s;tin|ction, <HI>Jacobites</HI></NOTE> them&s;elves as his more parti|cular Parti&s;ans; and there began the fir&s;t Mention of the word <HI>Jacobite,</HI> as a Title ju&s;tly given them, and which they quickly grew fond of.</P>
<P>It is no part of the De&s;ign to enlarge here, either in a De&s;cription of, or a ju&s;t Exclamation again&s;t the Practice of tho&s;e Men. The <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> Contemn'd them, but held their Peace, becau&s;e they found they (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> did their work for them; the re&s;t of the World &s;tood at Gaze at them, and look'd on
<PB N="7" REF="8">
them as Men of no Principle, neither fearing God or regarding Man.</P>
<P>In order to the Brevity, we profe&s;s you &s;hall expect no farther account of the Conduct of the&s;e People during the whole Reign of King <HI>William;</HI> how upon all Occa&s;ions they Plagu'd and Perplex'd him, how they Betray'd him abroad, and Embarra&s;s'd him at home; how they Ruffled him on the Partition Treaty, Sugge&s;ted his De&s;ire to Rule by a Standing Army, Bully'd him on his propo&s;als of keeping his <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards, forc'd him to give up his be&s;t Friends to their Fury; and at la&s;t, how they In&s;ulted his End. Triumph'd in the manner, Drank the Bea&s;ts Health that gave him the Fall by which he came to his Death; and have &s;ince, offer'd innu|merable Injuries to his Glorious Memo|ry: The&s;e are things we choo&s;e to omit, not caring <HI>renovare Dolorem,</HI> to look back upon them.</P>
<P>After the Decea&s;e of King <HI>William,</HI> Queen <HI>Anne</HI> &s;ucceeding, and making a Speech to Her Privy Council at Her Acce&s;&s;ion, gives the whole Nation an A&s;&s;urance of Her Royal Concern for their Pro&s;perity and Protection of their Liberty, whether Church or Di&s;&s;enters, as the effects of Her ju&s;t Government; but being her &s;elf Educated in the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Church of <HI>England,</HI> tells the Gentlemen of that Church, <HI>That tho&s;e of them who were mo&s;t Zealous for the Welfare and Intere&s;t of that Church, would thereby mo&s;t recommend them&s;elves to Her; and as the other &s;hould have Her Protection, &s;o the&s;e would be &s;ure of Her e&s;pecial Favour;</HI> and more to that purpo&s;e, as may be &s;een in the Printed Speech more at large.</P>
<P>This gave &s;uch a Loo&s;e to the&s;e Peo|ple, many of them being at that time Advanc'd unwarily to Places and Tru&s;ts, that they thought this word ZEAL, was an Authority to them, to run into all the mad Exce&s;&s;es that the mi&s;taken Zeal of mo&s;t Men, generally leads them into. This, as in all &s;uch Ca&s;es it generally has done, &s;hew'd it &s;elf more particularly among the Clergy, and appeared e&s;pecially Pointed at the Di&s;|&s;enters of all Sorts.</P>
<P>The Queen, who, <HI>God Ble&s;s Her Maje&s;ty,</HI> little thought, a Word &s;o well meant, &s;hould rai&s;e &s;uch a ferment among her People; and that when the general Quiet and Peace of all Her Sub|jects was Her true De&s;ign, the&s;e Gentle|men &s;hould &s;o mi&s;take Her, as, without Di&s;tinction, to fall together by the Ears, with all their Neighbours, whether Churchmen or Di&s;&s;enters, that would
<PB N="9" REF="10">
not come up to their Height; took &s;e|veral &s;teps, <HI>tho' all in vain,</HI> for the Cure of this Mi&s;chief: And fir&s;t, Her Maje&s;ty in &s;everal Speeches on Opening the re|&s;pective Se&s;&s;ions, of Parliament, pa&s;&s;ing Bills, Prorogations of Parliament, <HI>and the like,</HI> took occa&s;ion to explain Her &s;elf, to a&s;&s;ure the Di&s;&s;enters, of Her Pre&s;erving INVIOLABLY their Tolleration, pre&s;&s;ing all Her People to Peace and Union, and &s;hewing Her Di&s;like of the Extravagancies afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Many of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and indeed the be&s;t, mo&s;t Judicious, Chari|table, and well de&s;igning People among them, fell heartily in with the&s;e Mo|tions, and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to others, as well as practiced them&s;elves, the Peace|able Temper their Sovereign exhorted them to; the&s;e thus manife&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;hing<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Third Di&s;tin|ction <HI>High-Flyers, Mode|rate Men.</HI></NOTE> them&s;elves from one another, introduced more New Names of Sepa|ration; the fir&s;t were from hence called <HI>High Flyers,</HI> the other <HI>Moderate Men:</HI> and when afterward the&s;e Names began to be more particularly confined to Church of <HI>England</HI> Men, and no other, they were Abridg'd into <HI>High Church</HI> and <HI>Low Church.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Di&s;tin|ction, <HI>High-Church, Low-Church.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>High Church</HI> Men, <HI>for &s;o we are now to call them,</HI> upon this Behaviour of their Sovereign, manag'd them&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="11">

<PB N="9" REF="12">

<PB N="10" REF="13">
quite another way; for in&s;tead of Obey|ing the Exhortations of their Prince, they fell upon Her Maje&s;ty Her &s;elf; Reproaching the Queen, with for&s;aking the Doctrine She was brought up in; giving up the Intere&s;t of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion; abandoning the Church, <HI>and the like:</HI> and to &s;uch lengths they run things, that they obliged Her Maje&s;ty, in order to pre&s;erve that Peace She had &s;o con&s;tantly exhorted Her People to, to change Hands, and <HI>turn them all out.</HI></P>
<P>They went on however, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e Di&s;couragements, In&s;ulted the Queen and the Mini&s;try, with Libels, Memorials, and Lampoons; and at la&s;t, brought that mo&s;t Exqui&s;ite Lampoon upon them&s;elves, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Tacking the Occa&s;ional Bill.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth Di&s;tin|ction, <HI>Tackers.</HI></NOTE> Here they got a Fifth Di&s;tinction, as an addition to their Titles of Honour, and were called TACKERS, a name which rendred them Odious, not to the Government only, but to the greate&s;t part of the Nation; and &s;o low it &s;unk them, that in the next Election for Par|liament Men, which followed the Win|ter after, they lo&s;t the Game, were di|&s;tanc'd in all places; and when they came up to the Hou&s;e, appear'd &s;o weak,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
that they could not make any attempt in favour of their own Principles for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>In this condition they remain'd above Four Years; and the Nation began to enjoy the Plea&s;ures, as well as the Ad|vantages of Peace at Home: This In|terval produc'd wonderful Events, a continued Series of Victory and Succe&s;s Abroad; an exalted Credit at Home, to &s;uch a Degree, as might well amount to a Prodigy, and be counted Miraculous; and above all, the mighty Tran&s;action of the Union with <HI>Scotland;</HI> a thing, which when Future Ages &s;hall enquire into, when the many Attempts that have been formerly made to bring &s;uch a thing on, &s;hall be remembred; and how all the Wit and Strength of the Nation could never compa&s;s it before; will be reckoned among the greate&s;t Tran&s;acti|ons of the World.</P>
<P>In this State we continued, till the Party weary of their outed-Circum|&s;tances, finding their Intere&s;t become weaker and weaker, and &s;eeing no hores of rai&s;ing their Fortunes again, or bring|ing them&s;elves into Play by their own &s;trength, they fac'd about, play'd a very Subtle and Unhappy Game, and but with too much Succe&s;s; the rela|tion
<PB N="12" REF="15">
of which Story, if there was nothing el&s;e in it, might very well entitle this Tract to the Face it bears, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of a <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>The Whigs were now uppermo&s;t, and managed with a great deal of Glory and Succe&s;s, as is Noted;&mdash;But <HI>Humanum e&s;t Errare.</HI> The Whigs that were out of place, in Obedience to the Cur&s;e of Mans Nature, could no more &s;ee their own Cau&s;e carryed on without having a hand in the Profit, as well as honour of the Management, than they could &s;ubmit to the Admini&s;tration of their Enemies. This Created Two Evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. It divided the Whigs into two Factions, which we &s;hall here tell you might more properly have been confin'd to this Di&s;tinction, <HI>Whigs out of Place,</HI> and <HI>Whigs in Place;</HI> but to give it you in the Popular Terms as both &s;ides were<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sixth Di&s;tin|ction,</HI> Old Whig, Modern Whig.</NOTE> fond of having it be, and as it was re|ceiv'd in common, they were di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd into <HI>Old Whig,</HI> and <HI>Modern Whig.</HI></P>
<P>To explain this Unhappy Di&s;tinction, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to note to you, that the <HI>Modern Whig</HI> was under|&s;tood to be the Mini&s;try and all their Dependants; together with all tho&s;e, who by the Proceedings
<PB N="13" REF="16">
of the Government &s;ince the la&s;t Change at Court, were <HI>come over</HI> to act upon the Principles of Liberty and the Revolution; whether from Conviction of their own Rea&s;on, or from Knowledge of their true Intere&s;t, it matters not.</P>
<P>By <HI>Old Whig</HI> was under&s;tood, no more than the word expre&s;t, <HI>(viz.)</HI> tho&s;e who had ever been low <HI>Whigs</HI> from their Original, or at lea&s;t from their antient Practice, as far back as the Reign before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other Evil which follow'd this New Change, was, that the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> and the turn'd out <HI>Tory</HI> Party, from Principles however remote, fell in together, and joyn'd their Forces again&s;t the <HI>Modern Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Whigs</HI> in <HI>Place, Anglice,</HI> the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>This unhappy League, as it had no view to the real Conjunction of their Intere&s;t, any more than it had of their Principles; &s;o it appear'd to be altoge|ther Political, either &s;ide making u&s;e of the other as Tools, the better to com|pa&s;s the ruin of the Party they oppo|&s;ed, with Re&s;olutions to be equally fal&s;e to one another, when their own end &s;hould be brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>From this way of coming together,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
as no good could be expected on either &s;ide, &s;o indeed, none followed to either &s;ide: The Mi&s;chiefs which have hap|pen'd &s;ince, have all had their Ri&s;e and Spring from this corrupted Fountain. And as to make this plain, will naturally explain to the Reader the whole <HI>Phe|nomena</HI> of the Court Revolutions which have happen'd among us &s;ince that time; and lead us down directly to the very Birth and Original of the People now in our view; it cannot be unplea&s;ant to the Reader, to dwell a little with what brevity we can on this particular, which hitherto the World has been &s;o little acquainted with.</P>
<P>You are now to under&s;tand the Mi|ni&s;try, and its Dependants, as before, under the Title and Di&s;tinction of <HI>Modern Whig,</HI> carrying on the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation, and as has been noted, equally Envyed, and equally Pu&s;h'd at, by the <HI>Old Whigs,</HI> or <HI>Whigs</HI> out of Place, as by the Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>High Flyers, Jacobites&punc;</HI> or <HI>Non-Jurors.</HI></P>
<P>It might be ask'd, whether made the fir&s;t Motion towards any Union be|tween the&s;e Two? And that Enquiry might be an&s;wer'd thus; that being mutually Male-content for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, and at the &s;ame Per&s;ons, the
<PB N="15" REF="18">
nature of the thing, without the help of the Devil, <HI>tho' we &s;hall not injure Satan &s;o much, as to exclude him wholly from his ju&s;t &s;hare in the work,</HI> &s;eem'd natu|rally to bring them together.</P>
<P>They not only continually in all Company, and on all Occa&s;ions, ex|claim'd again&s;t, and ridiculed the Pub|lick Admini&s;tration, the Mini&s;try, and the Queen her &s;elf; but they made the &s;ame things the rea&s;ons of their Com|plaint, tho' perfect <HI>Antipodes</HI> in the De&s;ign and End.</P>
<P>It is true, they might be &s;aid to aim at the &s;ame end in one &s;en&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Di&s;|placing and Turning out the Mini&s;try; but it is evident, their remote&s;t aim was, getting them&s;elves in; with an un&s;haken Re&s;olution of excluding the other Party who they joyn'd with, as will be unan|&s;werably proved by the &s;equel of the Story.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of this De&s;ign, we found my Lord <HI>H</HI>&mdash;whom we &s;hall for that rea&s;on begin with <HI>(an Old Whig)</HI> making Annual Speeches, and by Print|ing tho&s;e Speeches, making the Clamour again&s;t the Mini&s;try become Popular; &s;preading the rea&s;ons of their Di&s;|gu&s;ts into the Mouths of the Vulgar; the <HI>High Flyers</HI> univer&s;ally chim'd in with the Noble Mutineer, and he always
<PB N="16" REF="19">
Voted with them in things, which at another time, his common Principles would not have left us room to expect from him; as particularly, again&s;t the Union, and for Dr. <HI>Sacheverell; Sed de mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum;</HI> let his mi|&s;takes &s;leep in his Grave: His being Dead, forbids us to examine the latter part of his Life, &s;o fruitful of Demon|&s;trations to this Argument.</P>
<P>The matter began to grow to a height towards the end of the Parliament, 1707, and had its Meridian Altitude at the Election of the next; and it was &s;omething diverting, as far as Men may make merry with their own Di&s;a&s;ters, to hear the <HI>Old Whigs</HI> exclaiming again&s;t the Means u&s;ed to keep out the Pretender; and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> reflecting upon our being in an ill po&s;ture to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was the Scene where this Tragi-Comedy was Acted; the Divi&s;ion there, was the &s;ame, but under different Names, and a Di&s;tinction not much heard of in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore need|ful al&s;o to be explain'd, that things may be made clear as we go. The Names of Di&s;tinction there, were <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Squadroni;</HI> the thing meant the &s;ame, they were both <HI>Whigs,</HI> one &s;ide as much Modern and as much Original as
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the other: but as their Breach began upon other Occa&s;ions, &s;o they appear'd divided to our hands; yet as to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, they fell in, whole and unbroken, with the general Divi|&s;ion; the <HI>Court</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> with the Mini&s;try, or Modern Whig in <HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Squadroni</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the Old Whigs in <HI>England,</HI> or Whigs out of place.</P>
<P>The Inva&s;ion had been attempted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was blown over, and the Election of the Parliament approach'd: The Heads of the Parties had met, and concerted Mea&s;ures in <HI>London:</HI> The <HI>Squadroni</HI> falling in with the <HI>Juncto,</HI> (as the Heads of the Old Whigs were called here) told them, that they had the Go|verning Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that they had been drawn in by fine Words and large Promi&s;es, to Joyn, or at lea&s;t ac|quie&s;ce in the Union; that without them it could never have been effected: and that now it was made, and over, Scoundrels gain'd both the Honour of it, and were rewarded for what they had little or no hand in: That they (the <HI>Squadroni)</HI> were univer&s;ally neglected, he Publick Affairs of their Country ntru&s;ted all with Worthle&s;s and Up|$art Tools of the Court, Men of no
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Influence in, or at all beloved by the Country: and they who had the leading Intere&s;t in their Country, as well as the governing E&s;tates, and who had more than once &s;erv'd the Crown in the mo&s;t weighty Concern, where that Intere&s;t was to be try'd, were lay'd by, as either &s;u&s;pected or &s;lighted: that now they, the <HI>Juncto,</HI> &s;hould &s;ee, that they <HI>the Squadroni,</HI> would give a turn to the whole face of Affairs on that &s;ide, and that they would return the whole Five and Forty Commons, and Sixteen Peers, of their own Party.</P>
<P>The&s;e being propo&s;ed as &s;trict Allies with the Old Whig Party in <HI>England,</HI> prompted &s;ome to go a greater length, and perhaps, di&s;cover them&s;elves farther than Men of their Parts and Penetration could have been prevailed upon to do. And being fully confident of Succe&s;s, they fear'd not on both hands to receive the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Malecontent and Tory, as Auxiliaries, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in over Ballancing the Court; ju&s;t as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> does now with the <HI>Turks,</HI> upon a Re|&s;olution to di&s;mi&s;s them when the Game was play'd.</P>
<P>The Clamours now ri&s;e high, and the Party Storms blew hard at my Lord <HI>Tr&mdash;r,</HI> at the Duke of <HI>M&mdash;h,</HI> and

<P>The&s;e were the common places of the times: Freighted with this Cargo of Complaints, the <HI>Squadroni</HI> went into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>Old Whigs</HI> here &s;epa|rated them&s;elves to propagate their $tere&s;t in the approaching Elections.</P>
<P>Nay, to &s;uch a height things came,

that &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality here, find|ing the Northern Detachment began to meet with Difficulties more than they expected, &s;ent them down a Letter, bidding them not be bullyed by the pretences of Court Intere&s;t, and great Names; for the Q&mdash;Her &s;elf could not &s;upport THAT FACTION long. Whether the Per&s;ons who wrote it directed them to expo&s;e that Letter, or they u&s;ed them &s;o ill as to do it without leave, Hi&s;tory has not made mention; but it was made Publick in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Copies handed about to all that had a mind to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The Election came on, the Tories were not Idle; they Voted in all pla|ces for the Old <HI>Whigs,</HI> and the Old <HI>Whigs</HI> for them; but the Battle went again&s;t them on every &s;ide: The <HI>Squa|droni</HI> where di&s;tanc'd every where; tho' they left no &s;tone unturn'd, yet of the Forty Five they could return but Eleven; and of the Sixteen, but Five; and of tho&s;e Eleven, Five were <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and Two of the other Five. Mo&s;t de&s;picably low did the poor <HI>Squadroni</HI> &s;toop to have carryed their point in this Election. Proud <HI>Ormi&s;tonio</HI> &s;toops to the Foot&s;tool of his Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Palaccio,</HI> to get him&s;elf Voted in; performing the mo&s;t di&s;honou|rable

Condition, of giving his Vote again&s;t his Principles, and again&s;t his Friends, for Count <HI>Cornwa,</HI> as the Equi|valent. We might give you many &s;uch In&s;tances out of the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e times, but this may &s;uffice to prove the Fact.</P>
<P>Being thus di&s;appointed and doubly beaten at their own Weapon, they came up to <HI>England,</HI> where their Allies had not had the Succe&s;s they expected, tho' much better than they. The&s;e made it up a little, by making loud Clamours at the Inju&s;tice and Partiality of the other Party, boa&s;ting that they would unravel it all again in the Hou&s;es: That in the Commons, they had Nine|teen Petitions to bring in, and that in the Lords, they had &s;uch unan&s;we|rable Arguments to bring, that they would turn out the whole number at once.</P>
<P>This Buoyed them up &s;ome time; their Friends, the <HI>Juncto,</HI> waited a while to &s;ee if they could make it good; for give the <HI>Juncto</HI> their due, they &s;tood by them as long as they could, con&s;i&s;tent with their Grand De&s;ign, <HI>(viz.)</HI> their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But when the matter came to the Parliament, the <HI>Squadroni</HI> moved the Pity almo&s;t of their very Enemies.
<PB N="22" REF="25">
When they came into the Hou&s;e they had nothing to &s;ay, nor any body to &s;econd them; nay, as &s;ome &s;ay, the <HI>Whigs</HI> began to edge from them, and no body cared to &s;it clo&s;e to them, till at la&s;t they were forced to &s;it on the other &s;ide in the Tory Corner; a place, the Scituation of which, mo&s;t People who were acquainted with the Geo|graphy of the Hou&s;e at that time, un|der&s;tood well enough.</P>
<P>The effect of all their Boa&s;ts ended in this; that in the Upper Hou&s;e they obtained the M. of <HI>L</HI>&mdash;to be put out, and the M. of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;to be brought in, but not this either, till the la&s;t had made a &s;eparate Peace with the other Party, and had made his Submi&s;&s;ion in form to the great Tefftedar of the Nation the Evening before.</P>
<P>In the Lower Hou&s;e, they throng'd in their Petitions as they promi&s;ed, but came &s;o late, or manag'd &s;o ill, that not one of them could be mark'd for a hearing that Se&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently not that Parliament.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Ormi&s;tonio</HI> made many a &s;oft Speech, full of nothing, according to his excellent Talent; and the Palatine of <HI>Jeriswallia,</HI> in the other extream, &s;poke in his natural thunder; but neither the unpolite &s;en&s;e of the la&s;t, or the
<PB N="23" REF="26">
polite emptyne&s;s of the fir&s;t, avail'd at all.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory hitherto may pa&s;s for a Comedy well enough; but the Tragi|cal part is yet to come; and indeed it has been fruitful of fatal Events to this Nation, as will yet appear in the whole cour&s;e of this relation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, you are to ob&s;erve, that what ever other Event this Management had, it brought into Play, and into the Hou&s;e, a &s;et of <HI>High Flyers</HI> or <HI>Jaco|bites;</HI> who from this time, &s;o riveted their Intere&s;t both there and here, that tho' the <HI>Whigs</HI> brought them in, tho&s;e <HI>Whigs</HI> could never get them out again; but they (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> &s;o fixt their Alliances with the High Party here, that they have not only &s;tood their ground again&s;t their Patrons, the <HI>Squadroni;</HI> but have Overthrown Court <HI>Whigs, Squadro|ni Whigs,</HI> and all together; making good the Text, that a Hou&s;e, <HI>or Party,</HI> divided again&s;t it &s;elf cannot &s;tand.</P>
<P>But the Old <HI>Whigs</HI> on this &s;ide play'd a wi&s;er Game; for finding which way things went, that their left Wing <HI>(the Squadroni)</HI> was defeated, and if they <HI>(the Junto)</HI> fought it out, they &s;hould be the more fatally overthrown, they vailed, went over to the Enemy. The Tefftedar of the Nation open'd a back
<PB N="24" REF="27">
door and took them all in, and they &s;hutting the door behind them, &s;hut all their Friends out.</P>
<P>Thus the War ended between Old Whig and Modern; and it was &s;trange to think, how in a few Months, we heard no more of the Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>This was a Tragedy indeed to the re&s;t of the Party, and many hone&s;t Gentlemen who had &s;ided with them upon the fir&s;t pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, was left to be ruin'd by the fury of the Modern or Court Whigs, whom they had ju&s;tly incen&s;ed in &s;o open an at|tempt to de&s;troy them. But the mi&s;|chiefs of this Divi&s;ion did not end here; indeed this was rather the beginning of the Scene; many Ages to come, may not <HI>for ought we know,</HI> &s;ee the end of it.</P>
<P>The Ungenerous and Impolitic Con|duct of the <HI>Juncto</HI> in this Ca&s;e to their Friends, was remarkably Scandalous; for they hardly ever concern'd them|&s;elves &s;o much as to enquire how they re&s;ented it. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was, to &s;e|cure to them&s;elves that which, as was before noted, cau&s;ed the fir&s;t Di&s;content among them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a &s;hare in the Ma|nagement; and this being obtain'd, they made no more &s;tir, provided for not one of their Friends that had e&s;pou&s;ed them, and hardly protected them from
<PB N="25" REF="28">
the Con&s;equences of their former ap|pearing in it as above.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al regret at this treatment, laid the foundation of &s;everal Specula|tions among Mankind.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Friends &s;aw that the&s;e were not Men to be tru&s;ted; that having thus u&s;ed Men that had &s;o faithfully &s;erv'd them, there was nothing to be expected from them; accordingly the&s;e began every day more and more to fall off from them, as Men not worth &s;er|ving, till at la&s;t they left them naked of a Party, by which they became an ea&s;y Prey to their Enemies, the High Flyers, who they them&s;elves had unwarily brought into Play as above.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Treachery of it brought a Scan|dal, not upon them&s;elves only, but upon the whole Body of the Whigs in Gene|ral, tho' the <HI>Squadroni</HI> have &s;ince wip'd off the Soil of it from them&s;elves, by a &s;teady Adherence to their former Prin|ciples, and an unanimous Conjunction in the la&s;t Election again&s;t their Ene|mies, the <HI>Jacobites; but it was too late.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The re&s;entment at the U&s;age they met with in this Ca&s;e, carryed many off
<PB N="26" REF="29">
from the general Intere&s;t of the Whigs, and &s;o &s;trengthned the hands of the High Flying Party, that in the great Tryal of Skill about <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> that Ca&s;e was lo&s;t by the De&s;ertion of tho&s;e who had been u&s;ed ill in this very af|fair; &s;uch as the D&mdash;kes of <HI>H</HI>&mdash;and of <HI>D</HI>&mdash;The M&mdash;quis's of <HI>L</HI>&mdash;and <HI>A</HI>&mdash;The E&mdash;Is of <HI>W&mdash;R&mdash;M</HI>&mdash;and many others.</P>
<P>Thus the whole overthrow of the Whig Intere&s;t, was owing to the Self-Intere&s;ted Management of the Whigs them&s;elves; and the letting in a Flood of <HI>High Flyers</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> became ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;mount tho&s;e who were got in: even contrary to the true De|&s;ign and the fir&s;t Scheme of the alterati|on, which was only to have depo&s;ed the Exorbitance of a few Men, but to have continued the management of Af|fairs in the Hands of the Di&s;intere&s;ted Hone&s;te&s;t Men of both &s;ides, without re&s;pect to <HI>VVhig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and &s;o all things had &s;tood as they did before, and the Change had been no other but what the <HI>VVhigs</HI> them&s;elves had declared nece&s;&s;ary, by the attempt they made as above, to do the very &s;ame thing.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30">
This is farther apparent, by the fre|quent Applications made by the fir&s;t Movers in this new Turn, to accommo|date Matters, and &s;ettle the Admini&s;tra|tion with as few Changes as po&s;&s;ible; in which it was apparent, not &s;o many Alterations were de&s;ign'd, as they them&s;elves had propo&s;ed to make be|fore; but they were Inflexible upon the Pre&s;umptions, that the Change could not be carryed on, but would run the Contrivers upon inextricable Labyrinths, Difficulties, and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and that the Queen would be driven back upon them again, by the Nature and Con&s;equence of the thing. In which it is evident they have taken their Mea&s;ures wrong al&s;o, and been di&s;ap|pointed as much as before.</P>
<P>However, had they been wi&s;e enough to have harbour'd them&s;elves in a timely manner before the Storm blew, they had &s;aved the Nation, as well as them|&s;elves; an unhappy Proof, that the former has not been always the main view even of any Party, but that either have in their turn, thought fit to make &s;ome Sacrifices as they have thought their Intere&s;t has required.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">
From hence it is apparent, and it is one rea&s;on why we have been &s;o plain and particular in this account, that the pre&s;ent change, being <HI>as it is for a while,</HI> Tory and High Flying, is not owing at all to the fir&s;t De&s;ign, which was quite otherwi&s;e, but to the nece&s;&s;ity which the untreatable Temper of &s;ome Men drove the new Gentlemen to, who were compell'd to take in one &s;ide, &s;ince the other had refu&s;ed; and to act in concert with them, till the other &s;hall come to them&s;elves, that they might not expo&s;e the New Mini&s;try in the Youth of its Admini&s;tration, to be cru&s;h'd be|tween Two Parties while it appear'd to joyn with neither.</P>
<P>If this looks a little like what a bitter Writer, <HI>the Review,</HI> calls making Tools of &s;ome Men, it is only of &s;uch who want temper to act from proper Mea|&s;ures, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing their Country; and who being brought into Bu&s;ine&s;s, to act in the Sphere of Wi&s;e Men, cannot di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from what they were in their own Country, with the Vicar, and among the unhappy Drink|ers of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>It's plain, the new Schemes are built (however acted) on a right Principle,
<PB N="29" REF="32">
&s;o far as it may be made practicable in this unhappy Nation, <HI>(viz.) That Go|vernment &s;hould be of no Party.</HI> We &s;hall not enquire into the private tem|per of the Per&s;ons brought in, but &s;o far as they act upon the foundation above, &s;o far they act right. If for the pre&s;ent they are driven to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;heltring under one Party more than another, the Power of Par|ties been unhappily grown too great to be at fir&s;t wholly neglected, it is either with a de&s;ign wholly to throw them off at la&s;t, as a Man leaves off his Cloaths by degrees as the Summer advances, and the heat of the Sea&s;on brings him out of danger of taking cold: OR, which we &s;peak with concern, tho&s;e who have &s;o boldly pu&s;ht at this change, and hi|therto have taken their aims &s;o right, mu&s;t faint in the carrying it on, and the whole mu&s;t mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>Having thus brought you down by many, and perhaps &s;ome of them, un|trodden paths of the &s;everal Parties who have been acce&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent Re|volution of Affairs, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enter a little into the other &s;ide of the &s;tory, and examine the conduct of the
<PB N="30" REF="33">
<HI>High Flyers,</HI> &s;o far as it may concern the affair in hand.</P>
<P>The Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities among the Whigs, having weaken'd their In|tere&s;t, le&s;&s;ened their Number, disjointed and enervated their &s;trength, and left them in no condition to defend them|&s;elves, the Attack is made, and they are overthrown as you have heard.</P>
<P>And now we have a new War be|ginning among us: For the Tory Party, who as we noted, were taken in as Auxiliaries, for the &s;ecuring this work, and &s;triking this blow home; they find that the view they had in the proceedings, is not likely to be attain'd, and now they &s;et up for Male contents. They &s;ee the Government begins to &s;ettle, that the grand Point is gain'd, and that the Plunder, the Blood, the Per&s;ecution, the Impeaching, and the Ruin of Families, Churches, &amp;c. which they hoped for, and promi&s;ed them|&s;elves the plea&s;ure of, is not in the Project. And they turn Chagrin, Un|ea&s;y, and Di&s;content.</P>
<P>It was &s;ometime that <HI>Picolomin,</HI> a Northern Hero of <HI>Gothic</HI> Original, had
<PB N="31" REF="34">
waited in Town, big with expectation; that according to a&s;&s;urances given him, as &s;oon as the Parliament came toge|ther, the Commons would not fail to vote in the Pretender; and that the Queen coming to the Hou&s;e of Peers, &s;hould declare, &s;he could no longer in Con&s;cience detain the Rightful Domi|nions of Her Brother, but that She had re&s;olved to demit in his Favour. That at the &s;ame time, his Young Maje&s;ty &s;hould appear under the Protection of the Life Guard, and &s;hould forthwith be Proclaim'd by both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>But finding things go quite contrary to his expectation, and that even his dear friends, on whom before their Ele|ction he depended much for the cer|tainty of this, were with the fir&s;t, in Voting an Addre&s;s to &s;tand by the Queen, again&s;t all Her Oppo&s;ers, and for carrying on the War, &amp;c. Finding the Pul&s;e of the Court run high, as ever, again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and no vi&s;ible appearance in Her Maje&s;ty, of an Incli|nation to Abdicate the Throne, he has walk'd about like a Gho&s;t for &s;ome Weeks; he is ob&s;erv'd as he goes, to mutter Old <HI>Greek</HI> Ver&s;es, and has &s;ome|times

<P>He happen'd &s;ome time &s;ince to be walking, whether to or from the Hou&s;e, the Learned are not agreed about it; but he meets not far from the place call'd HELL, an Old Friend of his of <HI>Saxon</HI> Race, Cou&s;in <HI>German,</HI> about a thou|&s;and times remov'd from King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and &s;till bearing his Coat of Arms.

It was not long in a time of &s;uch eminent Jealou&s;ies, but that a con&s;tant meeting of Gentle|men of &s;uch good Figure and appear|ing Intere&s;t, mu&s;t occa&s;ion divers Spe|culations; and the Town began to en|quire who they were, what their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was, and on what De&s;ign; but particularly, as mo&s;t natural to the temper of the time, <HI>what Party they were of.</HI> The word <HI>October</HI> being left always at the Bar, as the token of Ad|mittance, was con&s;equently the fir&s;t thing belonging to them that became Publick: Which led the World into a &s;mall Error about them. The Occa&s;ion was this.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervator's Country-man, ha|ving &s;ome Years ago worn that word thread-bare, in his very empty Witti|ci&s;ms upon Friend or Enemy, it was <HI>from thence</HI> at fir&s;t by way of Scandal given out, that this was a Whig Club. This in|deed &s;erv'd to let Wi&s;er-Men know, that all the Torles were not of a Piece; and
<PB N="40" REF="43">
that there were &s;ome in the World, who tho' they were far enough from Whigs, were not let into this Secret; that they knew nothing of the De&s;ign, and by con&s;equence, had not Acce&s;s to the Cabinet Councils of their own Party.</P>
<P>For as the&s;e Gentlemen had no De|&s;igns but what they had openly enough proclaim'd to the World, &s;o it was far from being de&s;ign'd to make their ha|ving A&s;&s;ociated together a Secret, or at lea&s;t for any long time.</P>
<P>It is true, in the Infancy of the So|ciety, they met frequently at &s;everal Hou&s;es; &s;ometimes at the&mdash;in the <HI>Strand;</HI> &s;ometimes at the <HI>V</HI>&mdash;&s;ome|times at the <HI>D&mdash;l,</HI> &s;ometimes at one place, &s;ometimes at another; and after|wards, &s;eparating into &s;mall Commit|tees, they had their private and prepa|ratory Meetings, in order both to en|crea&s;e the number of the Society, and prepare bu&s;ine&s;s for the general days of their A&s;&s;embling, that it might meet there with the greater Di&s;patch. At the&s;e &s;eparate Meetings, they frequently drank the <HI>Plebeian</HI> Juice of the Barly Corn,
<PB N="41" REF="44">
prepar'd at proper Sea&s;ons in the latter end of the Summer, and carefully pre|&s;erved for maturating it &s;elf by fermen|tation, Setling, Fining, Sparkling, &amp;c. And from hence &s;ome have imagined, they received their <HI>Nomme de Guerre, (viz.) OCTOBER;</HI> But Authors of more Authority affirm the contrary; and that the original of this Honourable Title, was derived from that word be|ing given by &s;ome of their leading Men, as the &s;ignal of their congrega|ting together, and the term of Ad|mi&s;&s;ion, of which more by and by.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, having thus brought them to their Collective State, it fol|lows to enquire who they were that compo&s;ed this Body; who the con&s;ti|tuent Members, and what the Occa&s;ion of the meeting: We &s;hall begin with the la&s;t; and perhaps, the Per&s;ons may be&s;t de&s;cribe them&s;elves by their beha|viour, when we come to the &s;ubject matter of their wi&s;e Conferences.</P>
<P>We need not trouble the Reader with Negatives in this Affair, as that they <HI>mere not</HI> Whigs, <HI>not</HI> Papi&s;ts, <HI>not</HI> Presby|terians, <HI>not</HI> Non-Jurors, that met at this A&s;&s;embly; that their profe&s;t Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was neither Wine, Love, Game,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Mu&s;ic or Mirth. But to come directly to the Point: they met to con&s;ult on matters of State, Government, Poli|ticks, Credit, War, Peace, Funds, Fa|vourites, Parties, <HI>a little</HI> of Religion, <HI>much</HI> of Court Matters, more of Mini|&s;try, and mo&s;t of all, of Intere&s;t: in &s;hort, they met to con&s;ider in full A&s;|&s;embly, the State of the Nation.</P>
<P>It has been reported, that they took great pains to bring in among them, abundance of Parliament Men, but that not being able to bring that to pa&s;s in &s;uch a degree as they de&s;ired, they made them&s;elves amends out of the Court; and that the Queen had the misfortune to find many of Her Maje&s;ties own Ser|vants, who eat Her Bread, and depend|ed on Her Royal Bounty, made Mem|bers of this black Divan; and in clo&s;e Con&s;ultation again&s;t both Her Per&s;on and Intere&s;t. The brief Hi&s;tory of which, take as follows.</P>
<P>It has been noted in the fir&s;t part of this Tract, that upon the late Revolu|tion of Court Affairs, the Pul&s;e of a certain Party run high, having given the Whigs a general overthrow, as in a pitch'd Battle, depo&s;ed the Mini&s;try
<PB N="43" REF="46">
disbanded the <HI>Juncto,</HI> and gotten the Mob on their &s;ide, they thought the Game all their own; nor were they in the lea&s;t mi&s;taken, for &s;o it was.</P>
<P>But they had no &s;ooner look'd over their hands, <HI>as they &s;ay at Cards,</HI> and found they had all the Trumps, Court Cards, and almo&s;t every thing they could wi&s;h, but elated with their good fortune, they began to throw their Cards away like Mad Men; and ac|cording to their ancient wild Practi&s;e, to ruin their own game.</P>
<P>But &s;ome better Game&s;ters among them of their own &s;ide, &s;eeing their Follies, clapt in, &s;natch'd the Cards out of their hands, and undertook to play the Game for them.</P>
<P>Ill luck was it for the Whigs, that the&s;e mad Geme&s;ters were not permitted to go on, for they would have play'd away all their good Cards at fir&s;t, and the cunning Whigs who play'd upon the re&s;erve, and had husbanded their Game, would have come in at la&s;t, and have beat them all.</P>
<P>But wi&s;er Game&s;ters taking up the Cards, they hold the advantage they
<PB N="44" REF="47">
had gain'd, and the Whigs are in danger of being lurched.</P>
<P>But to leave Allegorizing, the Ca&s;e is literal enough, and may be told as plain as we plea&s;e. The Queen having thought fit to change Hands in the Admini&s;tration of Publick Affairs, and to put the Mini&s;try into the hands of a New Set of Men: Of which New Mini&s;try, it is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Paper to &s;ay any thing one way or another. This was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The depo&s;ed Party &s;trugled hard, and gave up their ground by Inches; defending every Step, every Point, di&s;|puting every Po&s;t, and maintaining their Intere&s;t as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Party that Supplanted them, were not &s;o much of the Old High Flying Principle, as they were upon a New Sy&s;tem of Politicks, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of putting the Admini&s;tration upon what they called an equal foot; that no Party &s;hould engro&s;s either the Queen or Government; that the Favours, and Employments, and Tru&s;t, &s;hould be promi&s;cuou&s;ly granted and be&s;tow'd upon all Parties; and the be&s;t of all
<PB N="45" REF="48">
Parties be employ'd while the Govern|ment it &s;elf &s;hould be of no Party at all. This was called the new Scheme, and according to this Scheme, the new management began to work.</P>
<P>It happened rather as a con&s;equence of things, than by choice of the new Management, that they were obliged to take in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the High Party, to make good their ground again&s;t the Old Mini&s;try, and their Friends, who as I &s;aid <HI>dyed hard,</HI> made an ob&s;tinate Defence, and would heark|en to no terms of accommodation; ne|ver yielding to take Quarter, tho' fre|quently offered them upon very Advan|tagious Conditions.</P>
<P>The New Managers being thus dri|ven to the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in help to make good their ground, were ob|liged to treat with the other Party, <HI>viz.</HI> the hot High Flying hair Brain'd Tories, whom they thought in this Exigency, they might purely on the Principles of Hatred to the Whigs, bring in at demand.</P>
<P>To wheedle them into this, <HI>for they knew they were ea&s;ily to be caught,</HI> they
<PB N="46" REF="49">
baited their Hook with a roa&s;ted Prie&s;t, &s;et him to cry Fire, and rai&s;e the whole Nation into a Flame; immediately the bubbled Party bit at the Bait, and away they run with it, without &s;o much as feeling that the Hook hung in their Mouths.</P>
<P>The cunning Anglers play'd with them, as you do with a Trout; let them run on, let them rai&s;e Mobs, Tumults, break Windows, pull down Meeting-Hou&s;es, bully the Di&s;&s;enters, rabble Elections, huzza the Tool a|fore&s;aid round the Country; and in &s;hort, put the whole Nation into a Flame.</P>
<P>Sometimes they would draw their line a little, and bring them nearer hand, and almo&s;t to their Net, putting &s;everal Mortifications upon them, with fine Speeches, Addre&s;&s;es to STAND-BY, &amp;c. Tryals of Rioters, Promi&s;es to keep the Peace, hints of Temper to fellow Chri&s;tians and fellow Subjects, <HI>(Di&s;&s;enters)</HI> Di&s;couraging and Negle|cting the Prie&s;t and his Friends, and the like. The&s;e things went again&s;t the Grain, and touching them to the quick, away the Party would fling
<PB N="47" REF="50">
again, and flounce, and be in a rage, like a Lunatick. <HI>Well,</HI> then the State Anglers would try to tickle them <HI>&s;till as you do a Trout;</HI> give them a Sugar|plumb word or two, in an Addre&s;s put in Faction, as an Equivalent to Popery, Exemption for an Equivalent to Tolle|ration, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>This plea&s;es them again, and they come to hand for a purpo&s;e, but it la&s;ts but for a while; when feeling the Hook prick them a little, and the very thought of Moderation putting them into a fright, they take a run again, and away they go, carrying all before them; the cunning Workmen <HI>let them go,</HI> run out the line. Let them over-run the Presbyterian Judicatures, rever&s;e Decrees, and let loo&s;e Bears upon the hone&s;t <HI>Scots</HI> Sheep; and in &s;hort, let them play the Devil till they run them&s;elves out of breath a|gain.</P>
<P>After this, they begin to draw them to hand again: And with many a lu&s;ty promi&s;e, they brought the&s;e furious People to be &s;omething tame, to come into Management, and to be true Aux|illiaries. Many a Sugar-plumb, as be|fore, was they fain to give them; ma|ny an Opiate to doze and delude them;
<PB N="48" REF="51">
they learn'd the Language of the Party, and cry'd, <HI>Hereditary-Right, Pa&s;&s;ive-Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> as fa&s;t as any of them: In Exchange for this, they the Managers, got their Auxillia|ries to baul out <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, Hou&s;e of Hannover,</HI> and the like; tho' it is true, they never lik'd the &s;ound, and brought it out damnable rough. Thus our New Managers went on with them, and while they wanted the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of their Croud and Clamours, they chim'd to one another. The&s;e cry'd, <HI>down with the Phanaticks;</HI> tho&s;e an&s;wer'd, for <HI>they would pull down the Queen;</HI> the&s;e cry, <HI>Damn the Presbyte|rians;</HI> tho&s;e Eccho, <HI>for they will bring in the Pretender,</HI> tho' they knew they talk'd Non&s;en&s;e all the while; and thus both &s;ides &s;peaking what neither of them de&s;ign'd; they neverthele&s;s, run with a joynt Current, and open Mouths upon the Whigs, till at la&s;t they effectually Overthrew and Di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Now as they had various De&s;igns and differing views in this, tho' both agreed in the Means, <HI>(viz.) Pulling down the Whigs</HI> as a Part, yet they could never go far together, becau&s;e their End was not the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
The Managers had their end as before <HI>(viz.)</HI> to E&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves, to put the Admini&s;tration upon a New Foot as to Per&s;ons, to &s;ecure their Intere&s;t, and have the Weight of Affairs run in the Channel afore&s;aid</P>
<P>But our Auxilliaries aim'd higher, Per&s;ecution in Religion, Tyranny in Government, the Ruine not of the Whiggs as a Party, but of the Whiggs of that Party in Per&s;on; Plunder, Ra|pin, Deva&s;tation, Impeachments, Penal-Laws, Fines, Forfeitures, and the true Extremes of High-Church Fury, the&s;e were their Views; to this purpo&s;e no more War Abroad <HI>was the Word,</HI> Peace was to be made with <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was very probable they might &s;tand in need of; and the Rein of Tyranny being put into their hands, they were to Drive over all, according to the Principles of their Party.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;er Managers, tho' they had no Views of this kind, yet loth to lo&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Votes of tho&s;e Cla|mouring People, Sooth'd them as long as po&s;&s;ible; and having led them &s;ome|times by the Hand, and &s;ometimes by the No&s;e, one &s;tep after another, now in Hopes of obtaining their De&s;ire, then Doubting again, then reviving their hopes, till they have gotten them
<PB N="50" REF="53">
a great length in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they at fir&s;t entertain'd them for, begin now to &s;tand in le&s;s need of them than they did before.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e &s;eems clear enough, the Managers who made meer Tools of tho&s;e People, had no more mind to &s;et them up with all their mad Principles in the Admini&s;tration, than they had to continue the Whigs in the Mini&s;try; nor had they any real View of De&s;troy|ing the Whigs as a party; but having a nece&s;&s;ity to put a High-flying Face up|on their fir&s;t Management, to Ballance the Whigs, who were as mad as other Men in their Turn, and who had got|ten the Power in their hands; as they by Degrees got that Power out of the hands of the Whigs, by proportion'd Degrees they Checkt and Re&s;train'd the Fury of that Party.</P>
<P>The Managers in this acted very dexterou&s;ly, and held the Party &s;o in play that they never could &s;ee what Tools they were made of, or how they were fiddl'd in, to Dance in a Circle, out of which they were never like|ly to move till they return'd back to their Primitive <HI>Turn'd-out</HI> Circum&s;tan|ces, which they were &s;ure to do as &s;oon as ever they &s;hould Di&s;like their pre&s;ent Employment, or pu&s;h at any
<PB N="51" REF="54">
thing agreeable to their Declared Prin|ciples.</P>
<P>The Managers in this fell upon the Whiggs, ju&s;t as the Confederates do upon the King of <HI>France, (viz.)</HI> not to Dethrone him as King not to Di&s;|&s;olve his Dominions from their &s;ettled po&s;ture as a Kingdom, not to pull him to pieces and to &s;hare his Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions among them&s;elves; but to reduce him to Bounds and Limitations, to pull down his Exorbitant Greatne&s;s, and the U&s;urpt Dominion over his Neigh|bour's Right, to gain Security for his being a quiet Neighbour, and in &s;hort to fix the Ballance of Power upon Due Equality, for the Settling and Pre&s;er|ving the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Thus in treating the Whiggs, tho' with Rudene&s;s and Rabble, with Noi&s;e and Clamour, and perhaps with &s;ome Inju&s;tice in &s;ome Ca&s;es; yet this was never with a View of Depo&s;ing the Being or Name of the Whiggs as a Party, Di&s;&s;olving their Privileges as Subjects, and pu&s;hing them into Con|fu&s;ion: The thing was only to reduce their Power, and take from them the Seat of Government, Depo&s;ing what they call'd the Exorbitance of the Party, and taking from them the Power to $ppre&s;s other People.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55">
This was plain from the proceed|ings of the Managers when they had obtain'd their victory over the Whigg Mini&s;try; for they no &s;ooner got the Power of the Admini&s;tration out of the hands of the Whiggs, but they turn'd Whiggs them&s;elves, making very little alteration of Method, only an alteration of Per&s;ons in Executing: <HI>For Example,</HI> They no &s;ooner came to Admini&s;ter the Publick Affairs, but they kept on foot the &s;ame Alliances, engag'd in the &s;ame War, re&s;olved upon the &s;ame foot of Peace without abatements, made the &s;ame Capitula|tions, paid the &s;ame Sub&s;idies, decla|red their Re&s;olution to &s;tand to the &s;ame Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown, allow'd to the Di&s;&s;enters the &s;ame Tolleration, Rai&s;ed Money by the &s;ame Methods, and Lay'd Taxes and Funds of the &s;ame kind as the Old Mini&s;try had done before them.</P>
<P>Nay even in the Manner of Carrying on the War, and the Per&s;ons entru&s;ted with it, They made little or no altera|tion, tho' at fir&s;t, to plea&s;e their new Auxiliaries, <HI>the Tories,</HI> they were fai$ to make &s;ome Jingle with New Words and New Notions, &s;uch as removing the Generals, Removing the Seat of the War, Drawing away the Greate&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="56">
Body of the Troops from <HI>Flanders,</HI> and carrying on the War ESPECIALLY in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But this was but a Feint, an artificial Wind, made to blow like a Storm for as long and no longer, as it &s;erv'd the u&s;es it was contriv'd for, and then like a Summer Breeze which cea&s;es with the Setting of the Sun, it went off; the Morn|ing Clear'd up, and all things went on as they were before: The General, the Army, the Seat of the War remain'd all as they were before, and rather receiv'd an Addition than a Diminution, either the fir&s;t in Power, or the &s;econd in Number of Forces, and all things return'd ju&s;t to the &s;ame Method of proceedings as they did before.</P>
<P>It is true, and nothing was Clearer from the Nature of the thing, than that this was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;o, and could be no otherwi&s;e, and every Man who&s;e Eyes were open &s;aw it before; but our High-flyers, as it often happens with Men of too much Fire in their Politicks, continuing mo&s;t conveniently blind, put their hands mo&s;t chearfully to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the New Managers, upon the weakne&s;s and pre|&s;umption of their own De&s;igns being to $e put in Execution, as the Con&s;equence of this Alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">
Nor were they the only <HI>Dupes</HI> of the Age neither, for the concealed Jaco|bites among them, more &s;tupidly blind than the re&s;t, were &s;o Infatuated as to think that certainly the New Managers were at bottom Friends to their Cau&s;e, and that they had a View at the Re|&s;toration of the Pretender. This went &s;uch a ridiculous length, that it was wonderful to &s;ee how effectual it was to bring tho&s;e poor <HI>Out-of-fa&s;hion-People</HI> to di&s;cover them&s;elves, &s;everal of them in the North part of <HI>Britain</HI> took the Oaths that had never taken them be|fore; and when they Cho&s;e Members of Parliament, Declar'd tho&s;e Mem|bers had nothing to do but to Give their hone&s;t Vote for the Re&s;toration of their Sovereign; That it &s;hould now be done in a Parliamentary way; That Legal Authority &s;hould Joyn in it; That the Mini&s;try were to Joyn in it; And in &s;hort, flatter'd them&s;elves with all the ab&s;urd and ridiculous No|tions that poor Lunatics are wont to do, who fancy them&s;elves to be Em|perors and Monarchs, that they have their Guards, and their numerous Attendants round them, and are every way Equip'd like a Soveraign Prince; when their Ornaments are but real Chains, their Guards the Spectators

pitying their Di&s;order, and their Glo|rious Pallace the unhappy Cell of an Ho&s;pital, or Mad-hou&s;e: <HI>Qui Jupiter vult Perdere hos Dementat.</HI></P>
<P>Nay &s;o far were the&s;e People led on in their State Frenzy, that they per|&s;waded them&s;elves to believe, that the Queen was to Joyn in the &s;en&s;ele&s;s and unnatural attempt; That Her Maje&s;ty had been Convinc'd that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was not her Due, and being Touch'd in Con&s;cience at the Injury done Her Brother, would remit the Crown, Come into the Hou&s;e, and make a voluntary Re&s;ignation in Favour of the Preten|der; Contenting her &s;elf with an Ho|nourable Appannage or Maintenance &s;uitable to Her Birth, and then the Revolution was to be brought about quietly and without Blood by Con&s;ent of Parties.</P>
<P>Let no Man wonder, that where Mens Folly were run up to &s;uch an Extravagant height, the Di&s;appoint|ment of all the&s;e Glorious Gewgaws, leaves behind it a more than ordinary Chagrin and Di&s;content; and they that were Whim&s;y Mad before, turn Melancholly Mad now.</P>
<P>Some have excu&s;ed them by &s;ay|ing, the fir&s;t Steps of the New Ma|nagers were &s;o Extravagant, and
<PB N="56" REF="59">
look'd &s;o apparently this way, that it was no wonder to find Men, who&s;e De&s;ires lay all to that point, fall into &s;uch a Delu&s;ion; and that many Hone&s;t Men, who apprehended the coming in of the Pretender as the Greate&s;t Evil, were Drawn in as far by their Fears, as tho&s;e were by their Hopes, verily believing, that the true De&s;ign of all this was aim'd at a New Revo|lution, and that the New Party were all in a &s;trict League with the Pre|tender, &s;ince they thought that either the De&s;ign was to bring us all to a <HI>French</HI> Management, or that really the New Managers were Blind and Mad.</P>
<P>But when they &s;aw the Wheel with|in the Wheel; when they &s;aw the Scheme Work, and that the Engineers of the State Gradually and Wi&s;ely dropt all their fir&s;t appearances, and acted upon the &s;ame Revolution Foun|dation that others had done before them, all tho&s;e Fears vani&s;h'd at once.</P>
<P>As this di&s;covery ea&s;ed the minds of one &s;ide, and &s;hew'd them that their Ca&s;e was not &s;o De&s;perate as they Ima|gin'd; that we were not all running into Toryi&s;me, and King <HI>James</HI>'s days back again; &s;o it had ju&s;t the contra|ry effect upon the other Party, who
<PB N="57" REF="60">
found by degrees that they were really Deluded, that they had been cutting the Throat of their own Cau&s;e all this while, and that as &s;oon as the New Mea&s;ures were E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and the Wheel would move without them, they &s;hould be turn'd off, be &s;lighted and neglected, and become the &s;ame de&s;picable poor Wretches they were before.</P>
<P>Yet did not this Di&s;covery come all at once on either &s;ide, their Illumina|tions came &s;lowly on; &s;ome wi&s;er than &s;ome was the &s;tate of the World from the beginning of it, and will be &s;o to the end: Among the Whiggs &s;ome &s;aw into the Politicks of the New Managers early, and finding that the whole Scheme amounted only to put|ting out and putting in, that the Ma|nagement would be the &s;ame, that it mu&s;t be &s;o of nece&s;&s;ity, and that they could act upon no other foot but that of the Revolution; the&s;e grew ea&s;ie &s;ooner than their Neighbours, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted to make others &s;o; whereas &s;ome harder to be &s;atisfied, cannot yet per|&s;wade them&s;elves to believe but the De&s;ign is &s;till to Ruin our Con&s;titu|tion, Dethrone the Queen, Set up <HI>France,</HI> and Bring in the Pretender.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">
On the other hand, among the High Gentlemen &s;ome &s;ee into things and cry out they are betray'd, that the New Mini&s;try had Trick'd them, that they have only Chang'd the Men but not the Mea&s;ures: That there has no|thing been done for the Security of the Church: That the mi&s;manage|ments of the old Mini&s;try are not en|quir'd into: That the Trea&s;urer is not Impeach'd: That <HI>Ma...bro'</HI> is &s;till En|tru&s;ted with the Army, that the War is to be carried on &s;till as it was be|fore, and ESPECIALLY in <HI>Flanders,</HI> not ESPECIALLY in <HI>Spain:</HI> That the Tolleration of Di&s;&s;enters contrary to Agreement is Continued, and they called in publick <HI>Fellow Chri&s;tians,</HI> whom they always were made be|lieve &s;hould be e&s;teemed wor&s;e than Papi&s;ts: That Money is Rai&s;ed by Funds and Loans as it was before, tho' that way was Condemn'd as fa|tal to the Nation, and Entailing an Eternal Debt upon us that can never be paid: That the Whiggs have been Courted to uphold Credit, and the Bank Treated with by Parliament tho' they were told it &s;hould be Di$+&s;olv'd, and the Landed Men made th Fund of the Nations Credit.</P>

It is agreed that &s;ome are &s;till under the old Delu&s;ion, and either go on hoodwink'd by the Artifice of their fir&s;t Deluders; or are brought over to &s;ee that they were in the wrong to pu&s;h at tho&s;e things in that Manner they did, and that moderate &s;teps are the only Methods to bring their De|&s;igns happily to pa&s;s; that Time and Patience only can effect things, and that to wait is the only way to obtain their ends.</P>

<P>It is but lately indeed that their Clamours have been made publick, tho' for &s;ome time they have made their Complaints to one another: The fir&s;t that I find any Account of in the Modern Antiquities of this New turn of Affairs, was in Sir <HI>Robert Dandylyon</HI>'s Choice Manual, Entitled, <HI>Loyal Table Talk,</HI> where we have an Account of a Conference between two Country Gentlemen upon the&s;e State matters; There was <HI>Tom</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> an ancient Knight of great Renown for Zeal, But not according to Knowledge; and <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> a younger Man, but an older F&mdash;l, both &s;tanch true
<PB N="60" REF="63">

<P>The&s;e met together, and beginning to talk freely, whether warm'd with Zeal or the Bottle, the Author has not thought fit to acquaint us, But they took this weighty Que&s;tion into Con&s;idera|tion <HI>(viz.)</HI> How they &s;hould do to &s;ettle the Nation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> begins the Dialogue thus: <HI>Jack,</HI> What do you think of our Af|fairs, how do you like things? Prithee tell me your Opinion.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I do not like things at-all, I think we are like to be Bub|bled by our new Mi...ry, and I &s;hall be glad you'll let us talk a little freely about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>You know Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> when you and I were &s;ent for to a &s;ecret Committee of Hone&s;t Gentlemen, how Warm, how Zealous, how much Con|cern they &s;hew'd for the <HI>Danger of th Church</HI>&mdash;How Earne&s;tly they &s;olicite$ us to come in and Joyn with them t$ re&s;cue the Church out of the Hands $ a Party, who had Poi&s;on'd even th$ Right Reverend and Reverend Guide

of the Church with Principles of Fa|ction and Whiggi&s;me; and had even Do&s;ed the very Government it &s;elf into a &s;tupid Lethargic humour of &s;itting &s;till and &s;eeing our Holy Church ca&s;t into Contempt, her Clergy become the reproach of the Street, and her Wor&s;hip be ridicul'd by Innumerable &s;warms of Here&s;y, Faction and Schi&s;|matick Principles.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How did they repre&s;ent to us, that the original of all the&s;e mi&s;|chiefs lay in the mi&s;management of the Mini&s;try, who, to engratiate them|&s;elves with the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> had given up all Concern for the Church, per|&s;wading the World of her &s;afety and flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances: That this was nece&s;&s;ary to carry on their other De&s;igns which the Whiggi&s;h Party upheld them in, and that therefore to re&s;cue the Church from the Danger, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give a Turn to the Party, and to bring Af|fairs into a new Management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it all, and the mighty good Words they gave us, to per&s;wade us to joyn our Intere&s;t with them, to bring about &s;uch a de&s;irable Revolution, and to Re&s;cue the Queen,
<PB N="62" REF="65">
the Church, and the Admini&s;tration, out of the hands of the Whiggs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How did they promi&s;e us upon this, That they wou'd &s;et up the Queen upon Her Maje&s;ty's only Glori|ous and Firm Foundation or Title, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That of <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> and thereby Recognize and Acknowledge the Ancient and Profe&s;s'd Principle of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and of every true Son of that Church <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Doctrines of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And upon the&s;e Capitula|tions we came over to them, put our &s;elves into their hands, joyn'd our In|tere&s;t with theirs, and brought up Ad|dre&s;&s;es from every part of the Nation to concur with it, and thereby, as far as in us lay, to per&s;wade Her Maje&s;ty and the World, that this was the &s;e|curity of the Nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and to go a length no Country Party ever went before <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Addre&s;s her Maje&s;ty almo&s;t in &s;o many Words to Di&s;&s;olve the Parlia|ment; without which, I believe the Court at that time of day had never come in to take &s;uch a &s;tep, which if we had not univer&s;ally joyn'd in, mu&s;t have gone a great way to have

Ruin'd the Confederacy, and hazard|ed the whole Affairs of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>All the&s;e things are &s;o plain, and &s;o lately done, none can forget them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In Con&s;equence of the&s;e Mea&s;ures we Joyn'd all our Intere&s;t, and by the Conduct of the Inferiour Clergy, animated by the Succe&s;s of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> we Rais'd our Party, pu&s;h'd them upon all &s;orts of Violences, taught them to In&s;ult the Whiggs, and to Ri&s;e in Mobs and Tumults up|on the Di&s;&s;enters almo&s;t all over the Kingdom; by which means we Bullied them out of their Elections in many Places, indeed in mo&s;t parts of the Nation, and got Hone&s;t Gentlemen of our own Friends Return'd from all &s;ides, and have now got &s;uch, &s;o Loyal, &s;o Zealous, &s;o True a Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> Parliament, as has not &s;at in tho&s;e Walls for the&s;e many Ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And who could have thought, that after having &s;erv'd them thus Zealou&s;ly and Faithfull, and that after by their own acknowledg|ment, they could never have done their Bu&s;ine&s;s without us; we could be denied any thing in rea&s;on, much le&s;s any thing for the real good of the Church; lea&s;t of all any thing that had

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or have they once mov'd in Parliament to E&s;tabli&s;h the Known and E&s;&s;ential Principle of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> which our Church has profe&s;s'd upon all occa&s;ions, and which is &s;o much the &s;afety of the Crown, again&s;t all the Di&s;loyal and Fanatick Notions of the Original Right of the People?</P>

<P>What have they done for the Churches Security, or to let us &s;ee that we &s;hall ever be able to &s;ay her Dangers are le&s;&s;en'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tho.</HI></SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="68">
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or have they not rather &s;trengthned their hands, by giving to that abhorr'd Generation of Rebels, <HI>the Presbyterians,</HI> whom we look upon to be wor&s;e than <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> the Titles of <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> and FELLOW CHRISTIANS.</P>

<P>My blood ri&s;es at the&s;e double-tongu'd proceedings, and I cannot but think we are betray'd; that we are all running back into Whig|gi&s;me and the Junto; for my part I can &s;ee nothing in it, no material Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither: We only &s;ee new Faces, not one new &s;tep, at lea&s;t of the Kind we ought to have &s;een, and had rea&s;on to expect.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have had now a brief Hi|&s;tory of the Original and Occa|&s;ion of this Wi&s;e A&s;&s;embly, and how they came by the Name, <HI>The October Clubb:</HI> We &s;hall make here but a very &s;mall Digre&s;&s;ion, and proceed to let you into &s;ome of their mo&s;t Accurate and Political Debates.</P>
<P>The Digre&s;&s;ion I &s;hall make, is only to remark how they lay'd their De&s;ign here of bringing with them each &s;ome of their Friends out of the Pa&mdash;nt Hou&s;e, Members of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of C.....s: How it came to pa&s;s that they failed mutually in that part of their De&s;ign Authors have not left up|on Record; But this is certain, that this Di&s;appointment did not at all Di&s;courage the two Knights from go|ing on with their De&s;ign, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of propagating a Di&s;contented Society, which they &s;oon effected to their full Content.</P>
<P>It was not long after the re&s;olutions our two Knights took at parting, be|fore they met according to appoint|ment
<PB N="70" REF="73">
with their A&s;&s;i&s;tants: At which meeting their Grievances were at Large &s;ettled and lay'd down in Heads of Re&s;olutions, &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">I. Re&s;olv'd, That having faithfully Joyn'd in with the New Party, both in their Councils and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the overthrow of the late Mini&s;try, and &s;etting on foot new Schemes of Ma|nagement; they found the &s;aid New Party were not true to their Preten|&s;ions: But that the Work being done for which their a&s;&s;i&s;tance it &s;eems was wanted, they found the New Party began to drop them, and to proceed upon the &s;ame Model of Management, that they pretended to complain of before.</P>
<P N="2">II. Re&s;olved, That the New Ma|nagers were in a Plot, to throw en|tirely off tho&s;e who had thus faith|fully a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, made their Court to the Whiggs on pretences of Mode|ration, Carrying on the War, Rai&s;ing Credit, and the like; and that if &s;ome &s;peedy Cour&s;e was not taken, High Churchmen would be &s;oon as much out of Fa&s;hion as ever.</P>
<P N="3">III. Re&s;olved, That the &s;everal Ca|pitulations, on the Conditions of which they the High Gentlemen had a&s;&s;i&s;ted&punc;
<PB N="71" REF="74">
both with their Councils and Clamour, were not at all regarded. For Ex|ample,</P>
<P N="1">1. The War was not brought to an end, or the Treaty of Peace renewed with <HI>France,</HI> by which it might have been proved as they had alledged, That the Old Mini&s;try continued it only to pre&s;erve their Superiority in the Ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P N="2">2. The D ... of <HI>M</HI> ... <HI>h</HI> was not Disbanded, and the D .... of <HI>A</HI> .... <HI>le</HI> put into the Command of the Army, whereby it might be made appear, that not penetrating into the heart of <HI>France,</HI> was an Omi&s;&s;ion with De&s;ign to perpetuate the War.</P>
<P N="3">3. The War however pretended, and after Voted to be carried on ESPE|CIALLY in <HI>Spain,</HI> is ju&s;t directed as it was before; None of the old Troops, or but very few, brought over from <HI>Flanders;</HI> on the contrary more Ship|ped over thither from hence, and the War in <HI>Spain</HI> carried on by new Troops and Imperiali&s;ts as it was before, to the utter Di&s;appointment of our Friends at St. <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nothing had in the lea&s;t been Voted as to the Succe&s;&s;ion, or the Queen's Declaring in favour of the Ex|iled .... (Pretender)</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="72" REF="75">

<P N="6">6. The Taxes were Lay'd, and Mo|ney Rais'd by Funds and Loans ju&s;t as before, notwith&s;tanding former pre|tences of Entailing Debts on the Na|tion.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Whiggs were Courted to Rai&s;e Credit, the Whiggs Voted, and were joyn'd in tho&s;e Votes for Rai&s;ing Taxes, for Funds, and Borrowing Money by Loan; Whiggs were &s;uf|fer'd to Lend Money upon the &s;aid Funds, and Encourag'd to Rai&s;e Cre|dit upon promi&s;es of Moderation and Temper in Management.</P>
<P N="8">8. Whiggi&s;h Funds were Voted to be made Good, and the Exorbitant Debts Contracted by Whiggi&s;h Ma|nagement all to be paid, which it was agreed &s;hould all be wiped off with a Parliament SPUNGE, whereby all former Funds being re-a&s;&s;um'd, the Nation might have Carried on the War for Twenty year, if there had

<P N="9">9. Tolleration and Exemption from Penal Laws continu'd to Di&s;&s;enters, and that Factious Crew declared, even by Parliament, to be <HI>Fellow Chri&s;tians</HI> with the true Sons of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> whereas we had agreed to Di&s;&s;olve and Overthrow the pretended Tolleration, and to Extin|gui&s;h the abhorr'd Name of Schi&s;ma|tick from the Nation, by <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>

in oppo&s;ition to the Trayterous po&s;ition of Parliamentary Limitation.</P>

<P N="2">2. That upon all Occa&s;ions, the &s;hould endeavour to make their ju$ Complaints as popular as po&s;&s;ible and principally on account of th Great Neglect of the promi&s;ed Ze$ for the Church, which in&s;tead of givin her ea&s;e from Schi&s;me and Factio$ is like to be fobb'd off with Buildi$
<PB N="75" REF="78">
a few Churches, and Repairing her Liturgy, things they could willingly have parted with, for but one Vote again&s;t Tolleration and Exemption.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Anthony</HI> Marquis <HI>de Gui&s;card</HI> &s;hould in all their Writings and Di&s;|cour&s;es be Damn'd for a Poultrone and a Scoundrel, not for A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating or Stabbing Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> but for doing it by halves, and Stabbing him in the wrong place, &s;ince they have deter|min'd in all their A&s;&s;emblies and De|bates, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> That he has been the only, or mo&s;t material ob|&s;tacle to all the true mea&s;ures of High Church, and the great Cau&s;e of all their Grievances afore&s;aid, and that he has their con&s;tant ill-will, Back-ble&s;|ings, and Anathema's accordingly.</P>

<P>It fell out unhappily, that while the Society were deliberating upon the Eternizing their Memory in Hi&s;tory, and to that end giving them&s;elves a Name; a Gentleman of Quality comes into the Tavern, and coming up to the Bar, enquires for the A&s;&s;embly by the word OCTOBER; accordingly the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e &s;ends th$ Drawer up Stairs with the Gentleman to &s;hew him the Room. The Drawer goes up to the fir&s;t &s;pace in the Stairs when &s;eeing another Drawer at th$
<PB N="77" REF="80">
top of the Stairs, he &s;topt; and calling up to the other Drawer, <HI>Will,</HI> &s;ays he, &s;hew the Gentleman to the Club. What Club &s;ays <HI>Will?</HI> D&mdash;ye, the Fellow's a Fool, &s;ays the t'other, the <HI>October</HI> Club: So he carries him in.</P>
<P>In the very moment this happen'd, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>&mdash;&s;ends his Footman to the Tavern, to &s;ee if the Company was met; <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> Go to the <HI>Bell</HI> and enquire if the Gentlmen of the Club are come? If they don't under&s;tand you by that, give them the word, OCTOBER. <HI>Jack,</HI> a blundering We&s;t-country Booby comes up to the Bar decently enough, but asking once or twice, and the People being bu&s;y, and not minding him, he &s;tood like a Mute a while; a Drawer by that time being a little at lei&s;ure, took notice of him, <HI>Who do you look for,</HI> &s;ays the Drawer? THE OCTOBER CLUBB, &s;ays the Innocent Clown, bawling it aloud. Up two pair of Stairs in the Great Room, &s;ays the Draw|er, and up Stairs goes the Footman.</P>
<P>As the D&mdash;I would have it, who was certainly their G&mdash;d father, Three Gentlemen comes in at the very
<PB N="78" REF="81">
moment to ask for <HI>October,</HI> and they hears the Boy enquire as before, and up Stairs they go with him.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they were come in, the Society were in Debate as above for &s;ome Ho|nourable De&s;ignation to be&s;tow on them&s;elves to Eterni&s;e the memory of their A&s;&s;embly, when the fir&s;t Gentle|man &s;tands up, and Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf merrily to E&s;q; <HI>H</HI>&mdash;the Chairman for the time being; Mr. Chairman, &s;ays he, I think we may &s;ave our &s;elves the trouble of this Debate, for if I mi&s;take not our Society is Chri&s;tned already, and &s;o tells them his &s;tory of the two Drawers. While he is &s;peaking, Sir <HI>William</HI>&mdash;being one of the three Gen|tlemen above&s;aid, &s;tands up, &s;ays he, I felicitate you all upon your new Title of Honour, Gentlemen, and &s;o tells his &s;tory of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Footman.</P>
<P>Several in the Society took offence at it, and moved that the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e might be &s;poken to, that care might be taken of it; but it was got among the Drawers, and from thence it went among the Footmen, and it was to no more purpo&s;e to go about to &s;top it then, than my Lord <HI>Haver|&s;ham</HI>'s

<P>We thought to have given you a brief Hi&s;torical Account here of the diligent Endeavours of the Members of this Club, <HI>for &s;o we are now to call them,</HI> to Grace their A&s;&s;embly with the Attendance of &s;ome of our Na|tions Repre&s;entatives: But they ha|ving met with a great Mortification on that Head, not being able, ac|cording to their De&s;ire and Expecta|tions, to bring any of that Body to Joyn with them, no, not one; and the De&s;ign of this being only to &s;peak to the Honour and Advantage of the Society, we are unwilling to leave up|on Record any thing &s;o much to their Di&s;advantage and Di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the many bright Ornaments of the Church who came dayly over to them, and of the En|crea&s;e of their Number from two Originals, recited to near One Hun|$red and Eighty MEMBERS; the con&s;tant Flux of A&s;&s;i&s;tants from the <HI>$either Hou&s;e</HI> of Con&mdash;ation, the farther proceedings of the Diligent Emi&s;&s;aries
<PB N="80" REF="83">
they employ'd, and the like, the&s;e may afford a large Field of mo&s;t u&s;e|ful Hi&s;tory, and which in time may be made more publick for the Informa|tion of the Age, and the Caution of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent we &s;hall only acquaint you, that in pur&s;uance of the five Propo&s;itions mentioned above, the Gentlemen applied them&s;elves with Great Diligence, and &s;ome &s;ay, with unexpected Succe&s;s, to propagate the Cau&s;e they were Embark'd in, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to Erect a new Faction of Malecon|tents among us, the Nation not be|ing Divided enough before; and upon all occa&s;ions to go about Murmuring, Complaining, and rai&s;ing Jealou&s;ies among the People, again&s;t the Queen and her new Admini&s;tration:</P>
<P>For &s;till omitting needful Security to the Church, which remains in th$ &s;ame Danger as before.</P>
<P>For Encouraging the Factious an$ Evil principled Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>For Declining the Advantages of a$ Hereditary Claim to the Crown.</P>
<P>For Carrying on the War with th &s;ame fury as formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="84">
For &s;etting up for a Moderate ma|nagement of Affairs.
<Q><L>And the like.</L></Q></P>
<P>It happen'd one day, in the pro&s;e|cution of the&s;e Affairs, three Gentle|men were Introduc'd to their Society, who&s;e Faces were not well known; on a &s;uddain a certain Damp &s;pread upon the Countenances of the re&s;t, and they began to look upon one another; the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Society &s;eem'd to &s;top, and the Gentlemen all in little Com|mittees, of two, three, five, &s;even, and the like, talking upon private matters, till Sir <HI>M</HI>&mdash;&s;tanding up mov'd the Chairman to call to the order of the Society, which was done, and &s;ome|body mentioning the bringing in of three Strangers, <HI>G&mdash;L&mdash;C</HI>&mdash;&s;tood up and an&s;wer'd for them, That they were three Hone&s;t Gentlemen of <HI>North-Britain,</HI> and all of his acquaintance: upon which all were &s;atisfied and fell to Bu&s;ine&s;s again.</P>
<P>However this occa&s;ion'd a New Debate, &s;tarted by Sir <HI>H&mdash;M</HI>&mdash;, a worthy Member of the Society, of what &s;ort of People they &s;hould Admit or Exclude from their Society.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="85">
The previous Que&s;tion took up &s;ome time, and occa&s;ion'd &s;everal very Learned Speeches, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether they &s;hould Exclude any kind of Peo|ple or no? But this was carried in the affirmative for many Rea&s;ons; e&s;pecially this, That tho' their Grie|vances were to be made as popular, and the Rea&s;ons of their Di&s;con|tents as publick as po&s;&s;ible, yet the Mea&s;ures they were to take for the bringing it to pa&s;s, and the Per&s;ons and Engines they might emyloy, as well as their own Per&s;ons, it would be nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be concealed as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This being Re&s;olv'd, the next thing to be Con&s;ider'd was, What &s;ort of People were to be Admitted, or Ex|cluded; in which their Debates were very remarkable on many Accounts and we &s;hall give you an Ab&s;tract o &s;ome of them, tho' the Learned Speeches made on this occa&s;ion, by Sir <HI>P</HI>&mdash;, Sir <HI>H</HI>&mdash;, Sir <HI>M</HI>&mdash;and others, are, for want of room i$ this Tract, purpo&s;ely omitted, thing otherwi&s;e worthy of Eternal Remark e&s;pecially as coming from Men know never to have &s;poken Sence befor$
<PB N="83" REF="86">
and therefore certainly &s;peaking by &s;upernatural In&s;piration now: A mo&s;t &s;ublime Te&s;timony to the Goodne&s;s of their Cau&s;e, and a Token of the Great Succe&s;s they expect to attend them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t propo&s;al was about a <HI>Whigg;</HI> The Word was no &s;ooner nam'd, but an univer&s;al Hi&s;s begin|ning among the Clergy at the upper end of the Room, &s;pread it &s;elf throughout the whole Company: There was a Wi&s;er Man than mo&s;t among them, who Mov'd the Affir|mative; he told them there were &s;ome High-flyers among the Whiggs, and as all Hot Principles was u&s;eful to their De&s;igns, he thought it was a good piece of Policy to receive &s;uch, as Tools for their Work.</P>
<P>But it was an&s;wer'd tho&s;e Tools might be made u&s;e of at &s;econd hand, and without doors, and &s;o he was over-rul'd, and all manner of Whiggs, old Whiggs, or Modern Whiggs were Excluded, only with a re&s;erve for my Lord&mdash;<HI>Haver&s;ham</HI>'s Gho&s;t, if he thought fit to appear, <HI>W&mdash;P</HI>&mdash;, and Mr. <HI>R</HI>&mdash;, my Lord &dtridot; <HI>R</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="84" REF="87">
<HI>W</HI>&mdash;, and the D&mdash;of <HI>A&mdash;ll,</HI> three <HI>Scots Presbyterians,</HI> and two <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>It was long indeed before tho&s;e could be allow'd, but at la&s;t a Learn|ed Di&s;tinction was accepted in their Favour, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That they were all Friends to the Pretender: So they were admitted as <HI>Jacobites,</HI> not as <HI>Whiggs,</HI> no Favour being allow'd to the latter upon any Terms what|ever.</P>
<P>It was next Debated, whether <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts</HI> &s;hould be admitted into their Society, and it was carried for a per|mi&s;&s;ion, after much Debate, with this Re&s;triction: <Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Provided, Neverthele&s;s, and it is hereby Enacted by the Autho|rity afore&s;aid, That no Papi&s;t be ad|mitted into this Society who has abov$</HI> 300 <HI>s. a year E&s;tate in Land within this Kingdom.</HI></Q> It may be matter $word$ Speculation why &s;uch an Exception a$ this &s;hould be made: <HI>But the Ca&s;e $word$ very plain,</HI> for it was alledg'd, Th$$ the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> of greater E&s;tates, th$ they were willing enough to hav$ the Revolution of this Nation u$+ravell'd, and the Royal Line, as the
<PB N="85" REF="88">
call it, re&s;tor'd; yet they &s;ee &s;o much improbability in the Succe&s;s, and how they are &s;o certain to be ruin'd in the attempt by the&s;e &s;ort of Men, that generally &s;peaking, they are en|clin'd to &s;it &s;till and be quiet, till they have &s;ome &s;urer Game to play; and therefore lea&s;t the&s;e <HI>Wi&s;er-Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;hould make &s;ome prudent, moderate &s;teps, to the prejudice of the High|flying hairbrain'd Principles, and &s;o prevent their ruining them&s;elves, which they are re&s;olv'd upon in &s;pight of Common Sen&s;e; for this rea&s;on they Excluded &s;uch, at the &s;ame time Admitting all the <HI>Gui&s;cardins, French</HI>-Spies, De&s;peradoes and Mad-men, as well <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> as others.</P>
<P>We &s;hould here have de&s;cended to the affirmative of the Debate, and given you &s;ome Di&s;tingui&s;hing Cha|racters of the &s;orts they have agreed to admit, and the manner of their admi&s;&s;ion: But this, together with the Characters of the Per&s;ons, we are obliged, for want of room, to adjourn to the farther Hi&s;tory of their Pro|ceedings, which is preparing to be made publick; in which Account, their Principles, Politicks and Per&s;ons,
<PB N="86" REF="89">
may have ju&s;tice done them more at large.</P>
<P>Mean time we hope the&s;e Hi&s;torical and Authentick Memoirs of their Ori|ginal may be to the &s;atisfaction of the Reader, and may be allow'd to have an&s;wer'd its Title, <HI>(viz.) The Secret Hi&s;tory of the</HI> October <HI>Clubb.</HI></P>
<P>We thought al&s;o to have given you a New Poem to the Honour and Glory of the Society, a true Original, by a Member of the Clubb: But we are oblig'd to re&s;erve it for a farther op|portunity.</P>
