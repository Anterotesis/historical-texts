<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS la&s;t volume has been long written, and even printed.
The publication, though a debt to the purcha&s;ers of the
preceding volumes, was delayed from motives of tender|ne&s;s.
The author, who could not re&s;olve, like mo&s;t biographers,
to di&s;pen&s;e univer&s;al panegyric, e&s;pecially on many incompetent ar|ti&s;ts,
was &s;till unwilling to utter even gentle cen&s;ures, which might
wound the affections, or offend the prejudices of tho&s;e related to the
per&s;ons whom truth forbad him to commend beyond their merits.
He hopes, that as his opinion is no &s;tandard, it will pa&s;s for mi&s;|taken
judgment with &s;uch as &s;hall be di&s;plea&s;ed with his critici&s;ms.
If his encomiums &s;eem too lavi&s;h to others, the public will at lea&s;t
know that they are be&s;towed &s;incerely. He would not have he&s;i|tated
to publi&s;h his remarks &s;ooner, if he had not been aver&s;e to
exaggeration.</P>
<P>The work is carried as far as the author intended to go, though
he is &s;en&s;ible he could continue it with more &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf,
as the arts, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of painting and architecture, are emerging
from the wretched &s;tate in which they lay at the acce&s;&s;ion of George
the fir&s;t. To architecture, ta&s;te and vigour were given by lord Bur|lington
and Kent&mdash;They have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors worthy of the tone they
gave; if, as refinement generally verges to extreme contrarieties,
Kent's pondero&s;ity does not degenerate into filligraine&mdash;But the mo|dern
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Pantheon, uniting grandeur and lightne&s;s, &s;implicity and orna|ment,
&s;eems to have marked the medium, where ta&s;te mu&s;t &s;top.
The architect who &s;hall endeavour to refine on Mr. Wyat, will per|haps
give date to the age of embroidery. Virgil, Longinus and
Vitruvius afford no rules, no examples, of &s;cattering finery.</P>
<P>This delicate redundance of ornament growing into our architec|ture
might perhaps be checked, if our arti&s;ts would &s;tudy the &s;ub|lime
dreams of Pirane&s;i, who &s;eems to have conceived vi&s;ions of
Rome beyond what it boa&s;ted even in the meridian of its &s;plendor.
Savage as Salvator Ro&s;a, fierce as Michael Angelo, and exuberant
as Rubens, he has imagined &s;cenes that would &s;tartle geometry, and
exhau&s;t the Indies to realize. He piles palaces on bridges, and tem|ples
on palaces, and &s;cales Heaven with mountains of edifices. Yet
what ta&s;te in his boldne&s;s! what grandeur in his wildne&s;s! what la|bour
and thought both in his ra&s;hne&s;s and details! Architecture, in|deed,
has in a manner two &s;exes; its ma&s;culine dignity can only
exert it mu&s;cles in public works and at public expence: its &s;ofter
beauties come better within the compa&s;s of private re&s;idence and
enjoyment.</P>
<P>How painting has rekindled from its embers, the works of many
living arti&s;ts demon&s;trate. The prints after the works of &s;ir Jo&s;hua
Reynolds have &s;pread his fame to Italy, where they have not at pre|&s;ent
a &s;ingle painter that can pretend to rival an imagination &s;o fertile,
that the attitudes of his portraits are as<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Reynolds has been accu&s;ed of plagiari&s;m for having borrowed atti|tudes from ancient ma&s;ters. Not only candour but critici&s;m mu&s;t deny the <HI>force</HI> of the charge. When a &s;ingle po&s;ture is imitated from an hi&s;toric picture and applied to a portrait in a different dre&s;s and with new attributes, This is not plagiari&s;m, but quotation: and a quotation from a great author, with a novel application of the &s;en&s;e, has always been allowed to be an in&s;tance of parts and ta&s;te; and may have more merit than the original. When the &s;ons of Ja|cob impo&s;ed on their father by a fal&s;e coat of Jo&s;eph, &s;aying, &startq;Know now whether This be thy &s;on's coat or not,&endq; they only a&s;ked a deceitful que&s;tion&mdash;but that interrogation became wit, when Richard 1&s;t. on the pope reclaiming a bi&s;hop whom the king had taken pri&s;oner in battle, &s;ent him the prelate's coat of mail, and in the words of &s;cripture a&s;ked his holine&s;s, whether THAT was the coat of his &s;on or not? Is not there humour and &s;atire in &s;ir Jo&s;hua's reduc|ing Holbein's &s;waggering and colo&s;&s;al haughtine&s;s of Henry 8th. to the boyi&s;h jollity of ma&s;ter Crewe?&mdash;One prophecy I will vent$re to make; &s;ir Jo&s;hua is not a plagiary, but will beget a thou&s;and. The exuberance of his invention will be the grammar of future painters of portrait.</NOTE> various as tho&s;e of hi&s;tory.
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
In what age were paternal de&s;pair and the horrors of death pro|nounced
with more expre&s;&s;ive accents than in his picture of count
Ugolino? When was infantine loveline&s;s, or embrio-pa&s;&s;ions, touched
with &s;weeter truth than in his portraits of mi&s;s Price and the baby
Jupiter? What frankne&s;s of nature in Mr. Gain&s;borough's land|&s;capes;
which may entitle them to rank in the noble&s;t collections!
What genuine humour in Zaffanii's comic &s;cenes; which do not,
like the works of Dutch and Flemi&s;h painters, invite laughter to di|vert
it&s;elf with the na&s;tie&s;t indelicacy of boors!</P>
<P>Such topics would plea&s;e a pen that delights to do ju&s;tice to its
country&mdash;but the author has forbidden him&s;elf to treat of living
profe&s;&s;ors. Po&s;terity appreciates impartially the works of the dead.
To po&s;terity he leaves the continuation of the&s;e volumes; and recom|mends
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to the lovers of arts the indu&s;try of Mr. Vertue, who pre|&s;erved
notices of all his cotemporaries, as he had collected of pa&s;t
ages, and thence gave birth to this work. In that &s;upplement will
not be forgotten the wonderful progre&s;s in miniature of lady Lucan,
who has arrived at copying the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite works of I&s;aac and
Peter Oliver, Ho&s;kins and Cooper, with a genius that almo&s;t depre|ciates
tho&s;e ma&s;ters, when we con&s;ider that they &s;pent their lives in
attaining perfection; and who, &s;oaring above their mode&s;t timidity,
has transferred the vigour of Raphael to her copies in water-colours.
There will be recorded the living etchings of Mr. H. Bunbury, the
&s;econd Hogarth, and fir&s;t imitator who ever fully equalled his origi|nal;
and who, like Hogarth, has more humour when he invents,
than when he illu&s;trates<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For in&s;tance, in his prints to Tri&s;tram Shandy.</NOTE>&mdash;probably becau&s;e genius can draw from
the &s;ources of nature with more &s;pirit than from the ideas of another.
Has any painter ever executed a &s;cene, a character of Shake&s;pear,
that approached to the prototype &s;o near as Shake&s;peare him&s;elf at|tained
to nature? Yet is there a pencil in a living hand as capable of
pronouncing the pa&s;&s;ions as our unequalled poet; a pencil not only
in&s;pired by his in&s;ight into nature, but by the graces and ta&s;te of
Grecian arti&s;ts&mdash;but it is not fair to excite the curio&s;ity of the public,
when both the rank and ba&s;hful merit of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and a too rare
exertion of &s;uperior talents, confine the proofs to a narrow circle.
Whoever has &s;een the drawings, and ba&s;reliefs, de&s;igned and execut|ed
by lady Diana Beauclerc, is &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e imperfect encomi|ums
are far &s;hort of the excellence of her works. Her portrait of
the duche&s;s of Devon&s;hire, in &s;everal hands, confirms the truth of
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
part of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. The nymph-like &s;implicity of the figure is
equal to what a Grecian &s;tatuary would have formed for a dryad or
godde&s;s of a river. Bartolozzi's print of her two daughters after the
drawing of the &s;ame lady, is another &s;pecimen of her &s;ingular genius
and ta&s;te. The gay and &s;portive innocence of the younger daughter,
and the demure application of the elder, are as characteri&s;tically con|tra&s;ted
as Milton's Allegro and Pen&s;ero&s;o.</P>
<P>Little is &s;aid here but hi&s;torically of the art of gardening. Mr.
Ma&s;on in his fir&s;t beautiful canto on that &s;ubject has &s;hown that
Spen&s;er and Addi&s;on ought not to have been omitted in the li&s;t of
our authors who were not blind to the graces of natural ta&s;te. The
public mu&s;t wi&s;h with the author of this work, that Mr. Ma&s;on
would compleat his poem, and leave this e&s;&s;ay as unnece&s;&s;ary as it
is imperfect.</P>
<P>The hi&s;toric compo&s;itions offered for St. Paul's by &s;ome of our fir&s;t
arti&s;ts &s;eemed to di&s;clo&s;e a vi&s;ion of future improvement&mdash;a period
the more to be wi&s;hed, as the wound given to painting through the
&s;ides of the Romi&s;h religion menaces the arts as well as idolatry&mdash;
unle&s;s the methodi&s;ts, who&s;e rigour &s;eems to &s;often and adopt the
artifices of the catholics, [for our itinerant mountebanks already are
fond of being $ainted in mezzotinto, as well as their St. Bridge$s and
Tere&s;as] &s;hould borrow the paraphernalia of enthu&s;ia&s;m now waning
in Italy, and &s;uperadd the witchery of painting to that of mu&s;ic.
Whitfield's temples encircled with glory may convert ru&s;tics, who
have never heard of his or Ignatius Loyola's peregrinations. If en|thu&s;ia&s;m
is to revive, and tabernacles to ri&s;e as convents are demo|li&s;hed,
may we not hope at lea&s;t to &s;ee them painted? Le Sueur's
<PB N="x" REF="9">
cloy&s;ter at Paris makes &s;ome little amends for the impri&s;onment of
the Carthu&s;ians. The ab&s;urdity of the legend of the reviving canon
is lo&s;t in the amazing art of the painter; and the la&s;t &s;cene of St.
Bruno expiring, in which are expre&s;&s;ed all the &s;tages of devotion
from the younge&s;t mind impre&s;&s;ed with fear to the compo&s;ed re&s;igna|tion
of the prior, is perhaps inferior to no &s;ingle picture of the great|e&s;t
ma&s;ter. If Raphael died young, &s;o did Le Sueur; the former
had &s;een the antique, the latter only prints from Raphael: yet in the
Chartreu&s;e, what airs of heads! what harmony of colouring! what
aerial per&s;pective! How Grecian the &s;implicity of architecture and
drapery! How diver&s;ified a &s;ingle quadrangle, though the life of a
hermit be the only &s;ubject, and devotion the only pathetic! In &s;hort,
till we have other pictures than portraits, and painting has ampler
fields to range in than private apartments, it is in vain to expect the
art &s;hould recover its genuine lu&s;tre. Statuary has &s;till le&s;s encou|ragement.
Sepulchral decorations are almo&s;t di&s;u&s;ed; and though
the rage for portraits is at its highe&s;t tide both in pictures and prints,
bu&s;ts and &s;tatues are never demanded. We &s;eem to wi&s;h no longer
duration to the monuments of our expence, than the inhabitants of
Peru and Ru&s;&s;ia, where edifices are calculated to la&s;t but to the next
earthquake or conflagration.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of King GEORGE I.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now arrived at the period, in which the arts were
&s;unk to the lowe&s;t ebb in Britain. From the &s;tiffne&s;s in|troduced
by Holbein and the Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters, who not
only laboured under the timidity of the new art, but who &s;aw no|thing
but the &s;tarch and unpliant habits of the times, we were fallen
into a loo&s;e, and, if I may u&s;e the word, a <HI>di&s;&s;olute</HI> kind of painting,
which was not le&s;s barbarous than the oppo&s;ite extreme, and yet had
not the merit of repre&s;enting even the dre&s;&s;es of the age. Sir God|frey
Kneller &s;till lived, but only in name, which he pro&s;tituted by
&s;uffering the mo&s;t wretched daubings of hired &s;ub&s;titutes to pa&s;s for
his works, while at mo&s;t he gave him&s;elf the trouble of taking the
likene&s;s of the per&s;on who &s;at to him. His bold and free manner
was the &s;ole admiration of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who thought they had
caught his &s;tyle, when they neglected drawing, probability, and
fini&s;hing. Kneller had exaggerated the curls of full-bottomed wigs
and the tiaras of ribbands, lace and hair, till he had &s;truck out a
graceful kind of unnatural grandeur; but the &s;ucceeding modes
were &s;till le&s;s favourable to picture&s;que imagination. The habits of
<PB N="2" REF="12">
the time were &s;hrunk to awkward coats and wai&s;tcoats for the men;
and for the women, to tight-laced gowns, round hoops, and half a
dozen &s;queezed plaits of linen, to which dangled behind two un|meaning
pendants, called lappets, not half covering their &s;trait|drawn
hair. Dahl, Dagar, Richard&s;on, Jervas, and others, rebuffed
with &s;uch barbarous forms, and not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing genius enough to de|viate
from what they &s;aw into graceful variations, cloathed all their
per&s;onages with a loo&s;e drapery and airy mantles, which not only
were not, but could not be the dre&s;s of any age or nation, &s;o little
were they adapted to cover the limbs, to exhibit any form, or to ad|here
to the per&s;on, which they &s;carce enveloped, and from which
they mu&s;t fall on the lea&s;t motion. As tho&s;e ca&s;ual lappings and
flowing &s;treamers were imitated from nothing, they &s;eldom have any
folds or chiaro '&s;curo; anatomy and colouring being equally forgot|ten.
Linen, from what oeconomy I know not, is &s;eldom allowed
in tho&s;e portraits, even to the ladies, who lean carele&s;ly on a bank,
and play with a parrot they do not look at, under a tranquillity which
ill accords with their &s;eeming &s;ituation, the &s;lightne&s;s of their ve&s;t|ment
and the lankne&s;s of their hair having the appearance of their
being ju&s;t ri&s;en from the bath, and of having found none of their
cloaths to put on, but a loo&s;e gown. Architecture was perverted to
meer hou&s;e-building, where it retained not a little of Vanbrugh; and
if employed on churches, produced at be&s;t but corrupt and tawdry
imitations of &s;ir Chri&s;topher Wren. Statuary &s;till le&s;s de&s;erved the
name of an art.</P>
<P>The new monarch was void of ta&s;te, and not likely at an advanced
age to encourage the embelli&s;hment of a country, to which he had
little partiality, and with the face of which he had few opportunities

of getting acquainted; though had he been better known, he mu&s;t
have grown the delight of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all that plain good-homour|ed
&s;implicity and &s;ocial integrity, which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>the
hone&s;t Engli&s;h private gentleman.</HI> Like tho&s;e patriots, it was more na|tural
to George the fir&s;t to be content with, or even partial to what|ever
he found e&s;tabli&s;hed, than to &s;eek for improvement and foreign
ornament. But the arts, when neglected, always degenerate. En|couragement
mu&s;t keep them up, or a genius revivify them. Nei|ther
happened under the fir&s;t of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic. I &s;hall be as
brief as I can in my account of &s;o ungrateful a period, for though
the elder Dahl and and Richard&s;on and a very few more had merit in
&s;ome particulars, I cannot help again adverti&s;ing my readers, that no
reign, &s;ince the arts have been in any e&s;teem, produced fewer works,
that will de&s;erve the attention of po&s;terity. As the reign too was of
no long duration, mo&s;t of the arti&s;ts had lived under the predece&s;&s;ors
of George the fir&s;t, or flouri&s;hed under his &s;on, where &s;everal will be
ranked with more propriety. Of the former cla&s;s was
<Q>LOUIS LAGUERRE,</Q>
the a&s;&s;i&s;tant and imitator of Verrio, with who&s;e name his will be pre|&s;erved
when their united labours &s;hall be no more, both being im|mortalized
by that unpropitious line of Pope,
<Q>Where &s;prawl the &s;aints of Verrio and Laguerre.</Q>
The &s;ame redundancy of hi&s;tory and fable is di&s;played in the works
of both; and it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay that their performances were at
lea&s;t in as good a ta&s;te as the edifices they were appointed to adorn.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="15">
Laguerre's father was a Catalan, who &s;ettled in France, and be|came
ma&s;ter of the menagerie at Ver&s;ailles. The &s;on being born at
Paris in 1663, Louis the fourteenth did him the honour of being his
godfather, and gave him his own name. At fir&s;t he was placed in
the Je&s;uit's college, but having a he&s;itation in his &s;peech, and di&s;|covering
much inclination to drawing, the good fathers advi&s;ed his
parents to breed him to a profe&s;&s;ion that might be of u&s;e to him&s;elf,
&s;ince he was not likely to prove &s;erviceable to them. He however
brought away learning enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t him afterwards in his alle|goric
and hi&s;toric works. He then &s;tudied in the royal academy of
painting, and for a &s;hort time under Le Brun. In 1683 he came to
England with one Ricard, a painter of architecture, and both were
employed by Verrio. Laguerre painted for him mo&s;t part of the
large picture in St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital, and &s;ucceeding &s;o well
when little above twenty, he ro&s;e into much bu&s;ine&s;s, executing great
numbers of cielings, halls and &s;tairca&s;es, particularly at lord Exe|ter's
at Burleigh, the &s;tairca&s;e at old Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e in Piccadilly,
the &s;tairca&s;e and &s;alon at Buckingham-hou&s;e, the &s;tairca&s;e at Pet|worth,
many of the apartments at Burleigh on the hill where the
walls are covered with his Cae&s;ars, &s;ome things at Marlborough-hou&s;e
in St. James's park, and, which is his be&s;t work, the &s;alon at
Blenheim. King William gave him lodgings at Hampton-court,
where he painted the labours of Hercules in chiaro &s;curo; and be|ing
appointed to repair tho&s;e valuable pictures, the triumphs of
Julius Cae&s;ar by Andrea Montegna, he had the judgment to imitate
the &s;tyle of the original, in&s;tead of new cloathing them in vermilion
and ultramarine; a fate that befel Raphael even from the pencil of
Carlo Maratti.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="16">
Laguerre was at fir&s;t cho&s;en unanimou&s;ly by the commi&s;&s;ioners for
rebuilding St. Paul's to decorate the in&s;ide of the cupola, but was &s;et
a&s;ide by the prevailing intere&s;t of Thornhill, a preference not ravi&s;hed
from him by &s;uperior merit. Sir Godfrey Kneller was more ju&s;t to
him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide life of Kneller in the preceding volume.</NOTE>, though from pique to Thornhill, and employed him to paint
the &s;tairca&s;e of his hou&s;e at Witton, where Laguerre di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf beyond his common performances. On the union of Eng|land
and Scotland he was ordered by queen Anne to make de&s;igns
for a &s;et of tape&s;try on that occa&s;ion, in which were to be introduced
the portraits of her maje&s;ty and the principal mini&s;ters; but though
he gave the drawings, the work went no farther. A few pictures he
painted be&s;ides, and made de&s;igns for engravers. In 1711 he was
a director of an academy of painting erected in London, and was
likely to be cho&s;en governor on the re&s;ignation of Kneller, but was
again baffled by his competitor Thornhill. In truth he was, &s;ays

Tijou &s;aid, God had made him a painter, and there left him. The

&s;ome of his encomiums. At a tavern in Drury-lane, where was held
a club of virtuo&s;i, he painted in chiaro &s;curo round the room a Bac|chanalian

<P>John Laguerre the &s;on had talents for painting, but wanted appli|cation,
preferring the &s;tage to more laborious &s;tudies. After quit|ting

of prints of Hob in the well, which had a great &s;ale, but he died at
la&s;t in indigent circum&s;tances in March, 1748.
<Q>MICHAEL DAHL</Q>
was born at Stockholm, and received &s;ome in&s;tructions from Ern|&s;traen
Klocke, and e&s;teemed arti&s;t in that country and painter to the
crown, who in the early part of his life had been in England. At
the age of 22 Dahl was brought over by Mr. Pouters, a merchant,
who five years afterwards introduced Boit from the &s;ame country.
After a year's re&s;idence here, Dahl continued his travels in &s;earch of
improvement, &s;taid about a year at Paris, and be&s;towed about three
more on the principal cities in Italy. At Rome he painted the por|trait
of P. F. Garroli, a &s;culptor and architect, under whom Gibbs
<PB REF="18">
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="7" REF="19">
studied for &s;ome time. But it was more flattering to Dahl to be em|ployed
by one that had been his &s;overeign, the famous queen Chri&s;|tina.
As he worked on her picture, &s;he a&s;ked what he intended &s;he
&s;hould hold in her hand? He replied, a fan. Her maje&s;ty, who&s;e
ejaculations were rarely delicate, vented a very gro&s;s one, and added,
&startq;a fan! give me a lion; that is fitter for the queen of Sweden.&endq; I
repeat this, without any intention of approving it. It was a pedan|tic
affectation of &s;pirit in a woman who had quitted a crown to ram|ble
over Europe in a motley kind of ma&s;culine ma&s;querade, a&s;&s;um|ing
a right of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating her galants, as if tyranny as well as the
prie&s;thood were an indelible character, and throwing her&s;elf for pro|tection
into the bo&s;om of a church &s;he laughed at, for the comforta|ble
enjoyment of talking indecently with learned men, and of living
&s;o with any other men. Contemptible in her ambition by abandon|ing
the happie&s;t opportunity of performing great and good actions,
to hunt for venal prai&s;es from tho&s;e para&s;ites the litterati, &s;he attain|ed,
or de&s;erved to attain, that &s;ole renown which nece&s;&s;arily accom|panies
great crimes or great follies in per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank. Her
letters di&s;cover no genius or parts, and do not even wear that now
trite mantle of the learned, the affectation of philo&s;ophy. Her wo|mani&s;h
pa&s;&s;ions and anger di&s;play them&s;elves without re&s;erve, and
&s;he is ever mi&s;taking her&s;elf for a queen, after having done every
thing &s;he could to relinqui&s;h and di&s;grace the character.</P>
<P>Dahl returned to England in 1688, where he found &s;ir Godfrey
Kneller ri&s;ing to the head of the profe&s;&s;ion, and where he had yet
merit enough to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf as no mean competitor. His co|louring
was good, and attempting nothing beyond portraits, he has
certainly left many valuable pictures, e&s;pecially as he did not neglect
<PB N="8" REF="20">
every thing but the head like Kneller, and drew the re&s;t of the figure
much better than Richard&s;on. Some of Dahl's works are worthy of
Riley. The large eque&s;trian picture of his &s;overeign Charles the
eleventh at Wind&s;or has much merit, and in the gallery of admirals
at Hampton-court he &s;uffers but little from the &s;uperiority of &s;ir
Godfrey. In my mother's picture at Houghton there is great grace,
though it was not his mo&s;t common excellence. At Petworth are
&s;everal whole lengths of ladies by him extremely well coloured. The
more univer&s;al talents of Kneller and his a&s;&s;uming pre&s;umption car|ried
away the croud from the mode&s;t and &s;ilent Dahl, yet they &s;eem
to have been amicable rivals, &s;ir Godfrey having drawn his portrait.
He did another of him&s;elf, but Vertue owns that &s;ir Godfrey's de|&s;erved
the preference for likene&s;s, grace, and colouring. Queen
Anne &s;at to him, and prince George was much his patron.</P>
<P>Virtuous and e&s;teemed, ea&s;y in his circum&s;tances and fortunate in
his health, Dahl reached the long term of eighty &s;even years, and
dying October 20, 1743, was buried in St. James's church. He
left two daughters, and about three years before lo&s;t his only &s;on,
who was a very inferior painter, called the younger Dahl, but of
who&s;e life I find no particulars among Vertue's collections.
<Q>PETER ANGELIS</Q>
worked in a very different &s;tyle from the two preceding painters, ex|ecuting
nothing but conver&s;ations and land&s;capes with &s;mall figures,
which he was fond of enriching with repre&s;entations of fruit and fi&s;h.
His manner was a mixture of Teniers and Watteau, with more
grace than the former, more nature than the latter. His pencil was
<PB N="9" REF="21">
ea&s;y, bright, and flowing, but his colouring too faint and nervele&s;s.
He afterwards adopted the habits of Rubens and Vandyck, more
picture&s;que indeed, but not &s;o proper to improve his productions in
what their chief beauty con&s;i&s;ted, familiar life. He was born at
Dunkirk in 1685, and vi&s;iting Flanders and Germany in the cour&s;e
of his &s;tudies, made the longe&s;t &s;tay at Du&s;&s;eldorpe, enchanted with
the trea&s;ures of painting in that city. He came to England about
the year 1712, and &s;oon became a favourite painter; but towards
the year 1730 he &s;et out for Italy, where he &s;pent three years. At
Rome his pictures plea&s;ed extremely, but being of a re&s;erved temper
and not o&s;tentatious of his merit, he di&s;gu&s;ted &s;everal by the reluct|ance
with which he exhibited his works: his &s;tudious and &s;ober tem|per
inclining him more to the pur&s;uit of his art, than to the advan|tage
of his fortune. Yet his attention to the latter prevented his
return to England as he intended, for &s;topping at Rennes in Bre|tagne,
a rich and parliamentary town, he was &s;o immediately over|whelmed
with employment there, that he &s;ettled in that city, and
died there in a &s;hort time, in the year 1734, when he was not above
forty-nine years of age. Hy&s;&s;ing painted his picture while he was in
England.
<Q>ANTONY RUSSEL</Q>
is recorded by Vertue, as one of Riley's &s;chool, [con&s;equently a
painter of portraits] as were Murray and Richard&s;on, though he
owns with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s and le&s;s merit: nor does he mention any other
facts relating to him, except that he died in July 1743, aged above
four&s;core. I &s;hould not be &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve &s;uch dates, but
<PB N="10" REF="22">
that they may &s;ometimes a&s;certain the hands by which pictures have
been painted&mdash;and yet I have lived long enough &s;ince the fir&s;t vo|lumes
of this work were printed, to &s;ee many pieces a&s;cribed to Hol|bein
and Vandyck in auctions, though bearing dates notoriou&s;ly
po&s;terior to the deaths of tho&s;e ma&s;ters: &s;uch notices as the&s;e often
helping more men to cheat than to di&s;tingui&s;h.
<Q>LUKE CRADOCK,</Q>
who died early in this reign, was a painter of birds and animals, in
which walk he attained much merit by the bent and force of his own
genius, having been &s;o little initiated even in the grammar of his
profe&s;&s;ion, that he was &s;ent from Somerton near Ilche&s;ter in Somer&s;et|&s;hire,
where he was born, to be apprentice to a hou&s;e-painter in Lon|don,
with whom he &s;erved his time. Yet there, without in&s;tructions,
and with few opportunities of &s;tudying nature in the very part of the
creation which his talents led him to repre&s;ent, he became, if not a
great ma&s;ter, a faithful imitator of the inferior cla&s;s of beings. His
birds in particular are &s;trongly and richly coloured, and were much
&s;ought as ornaments over doors and chimney-pieces. I have &s;een
&s;ome pieces of his hand painted with a freedom and fire that intitled
them to more di&s;tinction. He worked in general by the day and for
dealers who retailed his works, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that con&s;cious dignity of
talents that &s;corned dependence, and made him hate to be employed
by men who&s;e birth and fortune confined his fancy and re&s;trained his
freedom. Vertue records a proof of his merit which I fear will enter
into the panegyrics of few modern painters&mdash;he &s;ays he &s;aw &s;everal
of Cradock's pictures ri&s;e quickly after his death to three and four
<PB N="11" REF="23">
times the price that he had received for them living. He died in
1717, and was buried at St. Mary's, Whitechapel.
<Q>PETER CASTEELS</Q>
was, like Cradock, though inferior in merit, a painter of fowls, but
more commonly of flowers, yet neither with the boldne&s;s and relievo
of a ma&s;ter, nor with the fini&s;hed accuracy that in &s;o many Flemi&s;h
painters almo&s;t atones for want of genius. He was born at Antwerp
in 1684, and in 1708 came over with his<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">So Vertue. I &s;uppo&s;e he means brother-in-law.</NOTE> brother Peter Tillemans.
In 1716 he made a &s;hort journey to his native city, but returned &s;oon.
In 1726 he publi&s;hed twelve plates of birds and fowl which he had
de&s;igned and etched him&s;elf, and did a few other things in the &s;ame
way. In 1735 he retired to Tooting, to de&s;ign for callico-printers:
and la&s;tly, the manufacture being removed thither, to Richmond,
where he died of a lingering illne&s;s May 16, 1749.
<Q>&mdash;DAGAR,</Q>
the &s;on of a French painter, and him&s;elf born in France, came young
into England and ro&s;e to great bu&s;ine&s;s, though upon a very &s;lender
&s;tock of merit. He was violently afflicted with the gout and &s;tone,
and died in May 1723, at the age of Fifty-four. He left a &s;on
whom he bred to his own profe&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="12" REF="24">
<Q>CHARLES JERVAS.</Q>
No painter of &s;o much eminence as Jervas, is taken &s;o little notice
of by Vertue in his memorandums, who neither &s;pecifies the family,
birth or death of this arti&s;t. The latter, as well as I remember,
happened at his<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He had another hou&s;e at Hampton.</NOTE> hou&s;e in Cleveland-court, in 1739, or 1740. One
would think Vertue fore&s;aw how little curio&s;ity po&s;terity would feel
to know more of a man who has bequeathed them &s;uch wretched
daubings. Yet, between the badne&s;s of the age's ta&s;te, the dearth
of good ma&s;ters, and a fa&s;hionable reputation, Jervas &s;at at the top
of his profe&s;&s;ion; and his own vanity thought no encomium di&s;pro|portionate
to his merit. Yet was he defective in drawing, colour|ing,
compo&s;ition, and even in that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and perhaps mo&s;t
ea&s;y talent of a portrait-painter, likene&s;s. In general, his pictures
are a light flim&s;y kind of fan-painting as large as the life. Yet I
have &s;een a few of his works highly coloured; and it is certain that
his copies of Carlo Maratti, whom mo&s;t he &s;tudied and imitated,
were extremely ju&s;t, and &s;carce inferior to the originals. It is a well-known
&s;tory of him, that having &s;ucceeded happily in copying [he
thought, in &s;urpa&s;&s;ing] a picture of Titian, he looked fir&s;t at the
one, then at the other, and then with parental complacency cried,
&startq;Poor little Tit! how he would &s;tare!&endq;</P>
<P>But what will recommend the name of Jervas to inqui&s;itive po&s;|terity
was his intimacy with Pope, whom he in&s;tructed to draw and
paint, whom therefore the&s;e anecdotes are proud to boa&s;t of and

effect of chance, of the lady's charms, or of the conveniency of her
name to the mea&s;ure of the ver&s;e. Jervas had ventured to look on
that fair one with more than a painter's eyes; &s;o entirely did the
lovely form po&s;&s;e&s;s his imagination, that many a homely dame was
delighted to find her picture re&s;emble lady Bridgwater. Yet neither
his pre&s;umption nor his pa&s;&s;ion could extingui&s;h his &s;elf-love. One
day, as &s;he was &s;itting to him, he ran over the beauties of her face
with rapture&mdash;&startq;but, &s;aid he, I cannot help telling your lady&s;hip
that you have not a hand&s;ome ear.&endq; &startq;No! &s;aid lady Bridgwater;
pray, Mr. Jervas, what is a hand&s;ome ear?&endq; He turned a&s;ide his
cap, and &s;howed her his own.</P>
<P>What little more I have to &s;ay of him, is chiefly &s;cattered among&s;t
the notes of Vertue. He was born in Ireland, and for a year &s;tudied
under &s;ir Godfrey Kneller. Norris, frame-maker and keeper of the
pictures to king William and queen Anne, was his fir&s;t patron, and
permitted him to copy what he plea&s;ed in the royal collection. At
Hampton-court he copied the cartoons in little, and &s;old them to
Dr. George Clarke of Oxford, who became his protector and fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="14" REF="26" MS="Y">
him with money to vi&s;it Paris and Italy. At the former he
lent two of his cartoons to Audran, who engraved them, but died
before he could begin the re&s;t. At Rome he applied him&s;elf to learn
to draw, for though thirty years old, he &s;aid he had begun at the
wrong end, and had only &s;tudied colouring. The friend&s;hip of Pope,
and the patronage of other men of genius and rank, extended a re|putation
built on &s;uch &s;light foundations: to which not a little con|tributed,
we may &s;uppo&s;e, the Tatler, No. VIII, April 18, 1709,
who calls him <HI>the la&s;t great painter that Italy has &s;ent us.</HI> To this
incen&s;e a window worth 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> added the &s;olid, and made him her
hu&s;band. In 1738 he again travelled to Italy for his health, but
&s;urvived that journey only a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>He tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed a new edition of Don Quixote. His
collection of drawings and Roman fayence, called<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is a large and fine collection of this ware at the late &s;ir Andrew Fountain's at Narford in Norfolk.</NOTE> Raphael's earth|en-ware,
and a fine cabinet of ivory carvings by Fiamingo, were
&s;old, the drawings in April 1741, and the re&s;t after the death of
his wife.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be conceived by tho&s;e who know any thing of the
&s;tate of painting in this country of late years, that this work pretends
to no more than &s;pecifying the profe&s;&s;ors of mo&s;t vogue. Portrait-painting
has increa&s;ed to &s;o exuberant a degree in this age, that it
would be difficult even to compute the number of limners that have
appeared within the century. Con&s;equently it is almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary
that the repre&s;entations of men &s;hould peri&s;h and quit the &s;cene to
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as it is that the human race &s;hould give place to ri&s;|ing

generations. And indeed the mortality is almo&s;t as rapid. Por|traits
that co&s;t twenty, thirty, &s;ixty guineas, and that proudly take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the drawing-room, give way in the next generation to

of many more who babble of Titian and Vandyck, yet only imitate

<Q>JONATHAN RICHARDSON</Q>
was undoubtedly one of the be&s;t Engli&s;h painters of a head, that had
appeared in this country. There is &s;trength, roundne&s;s, and bold|ne&s;s
in his colouring; but his men want dignity, and his women
grace. The good &s;en&s;e of the nation is characteri&s;ed in his portraits.
You &s;ee he lived in an age when neither enthu&s;ia&s;m nor &s;ervility were
predominant. Yet with a pencil &s;o firm, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a numerous
and excellent collection of drawings, full of the theory, and pro|found
in reflections on his art, he drew nothing well below the head,
and was void of imagination. His attitudes, draperies, and back|grounds
<PB N="16" REF="29" MS="Y">
are totally in&s;ipid and unmeaning; &s;o ill did he apply to his
own practice the &s;agacious rules and hints he be&s;towed on others.
Though he wrote with fire and judgment, his paintings owed little
to either. No man dived deeper into the inexhau&s;tible &s;tores of Ra|phael,
or was more &s;mitten with the native lu&s;tre of Vandyck. Yet
though capable of ta&s;ting the elevation of the one and the elegance
of the other, he could never contrive to &s;ee with their eyes, when he
was to copy nature him&s;elf. One wonders that he could comment
their works &s;o well, and imitate them &s;o little.</P>
<P>Richard&s;on was born about the year 1665, and again&s;t his incli|nation

with whom he lived &s;ix years, when obtaining his freedom by the
death of his ma&s;ter, he followed the bent of his di&s;po&s;ition, and at
twenty years old became the di&s;ciple of Riley; with whom he lived
four years, who&s;e neice he married, and of who&s;e manner he acquired
enough to maintain a &s;olid and la&s;ting reputation, even during the
lives of Kneller and Dahl, and to remain at the head of the profe&s;|&s;ion
when they went off the &s;tage. He quitted bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf &s;ome
years before his death; but his temperance and virtue contributed to
protract his life to a great length in the full enjoyment of his under|&s;tanding,
and in the felicity of dome&s;tic friend&s;hip. He had had a
paralytic &s;troke that affected his arm, yet never di&s;abled him from
his cu&s;tomary walks and exerci&s;e. He had been in St. James's park,
and died &s;uddenly at his hou&s;e in Queen-&s;quare on his return home,
May 28, 1745, when he had pa&s;&s;ed the eightieth year of his age.
He left a &s;on and four daughters, one of whom was married to his
di&s;ciple Mr. Hud&s;on, and another to Mr. Grig&s;on, an attorney.
<PB N="17" REF="30">
The ta&s;te and learning of the &s;on, and the harmony in which he
lived with his father, are vi&s;ible in the joint works they compo&s;ed.
The father in 1719 publi&s;hed two di&s;cour&s;es; 1. An E&s;&s;ay on the
whole Art of Critici&s;m as it relates to Painting; 2. An Argument

Ba&s;-reliefs, Drawings and Pictures, in Italy, &amp;c. with Remarks by
Mr. Richard&s;on, Sen. and Jun. The &s;on made the journey; and
from his notes, letters, and ob&s;ervations, they both at his return
compiled this valuable work. As the father was a formal man, with
a &s;low, but loud and &s;onorous voice, and, in truth, with &s;ome af|fectation
in his manner; and as there is much &s;ingularity in his &s;tyle
and expre&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e peculiarities, for they were &s;carce foibles, &s;truck
&s;uperficial readers, and between the laughers and the envious, the
book was much ridiculed. Yet both this and the former are full of
matter, good &s;en&s;e and in&s;truction: and the very quaintne&s;s of &s;ome
expre&s;&s;ions, and their laboured novelty, &s;how the difficulty the au|thor
had to convey meer vi&s;ible ideas through the medium of lan|guage.
Tho&s;e works remind one of Cibber's inimitable treati&s;e on
the &s;tage: when an author writes on his own profe&s;&s;ion, feels it pro|foundly,
and is &s;en&s;ible his readers do not, he is not only excu&s;able,
but meritorious, for illuminating the &s;ubject by new metaphors or
bolder figures than ordinary. He is the coxcomb that &s;neers, not he
that in&s;tructs in appropriated diction.</P>

If the&s;e authors were cen&s;ured, when conver&s;ant within their own
circle, it was not to be expected that they would be treated with
milder indulgence, when they ventured into a &s;i&s;ter region. In 1734
they publi&s;hed a very thick octavo, containing explanatory notes and
remarks on Milton's Paradi&s;e lo&s;t, with the life of the author, and a
di&s;cour&s;e on the poem. Again were the good &s;en&s;e, the judicious
critici&s;ms, and the &s;entiments that broke forth in this work, forgot|ten
in the &s;ingularities that di&s;tingui&s;h it. The father having &s;aid in
apology for being little conver&s;ant in cla&s;&s;ic litterature, that he had
looked into them through his &s;on, Hogarth, whom a quibble could
furni&s;h with wit, drew the father peeping through the nether end of
a tele&s;cope, with which his &s;on was perforated, at a Virgil aloft on a
&s;helf. Yet how forcibly Richard&s;on entered into the &s;pirit of his
author appears from his comprehen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>Milton was
an ancient born two thou&s;and years after his time.</HI> Richard&s;on, how|ever,
was as incapable of reaching the &s;ublime or harmonious in
poetry as he was in painting, though &s;o capable of illu&s;trating both.
Some &s;pecimens of ver&s;e, that he has given us here and there in his
works, excite no curio&s;ity for more, though he informs us in his
Milton, that if painting was his wife, poetry had been his &s;ecret
concubine. It is remarkable that another commentator of Milton
has made the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion;

<Q>&mdash;GRISONI</Q>
was the &s;on of a painter at Florence, whence Mr. Talman brought
him over in 1715. He painted hi&s;tory, land&s;cape, and &s;ometimes
portrait; but his bu&s;ine&s;s declining, he &s;old his pictures by auction,
in 1728, and returned to his own country with a wife whom he had
married here of the name of St. John.
<Q>WILLIAM AIKMAN</Q>
was born in Scotland, and educated under &s;ir John Medina. He
came young to London, travelled to Italy, and vi&s;ited Turkey, and
returned through London to Scotland, where he was patronized by
John duke of Argyle the general, and many of the nobility. After
two or three years he &s;ettled in London, and met with no le&s;s encou|ragement&mdash;but
falling into a long and langui&s;hing di&s;temper, his
phy&s;icians advi&s;ed him to try his native air, but he died at his hou&s;e
in Leice&s;ter-fields, in June, 1731, aged fifty. His body, by his
own de&s;ire, was carried to and interred in Scotland. Vertue com|mends
his portrait of Gay for the great likene&s;s, and quotes the fol|lowing

S. Boy&s;e;

of the &s;ame country with the preceding, was &s;on of a clergyman, and
I think de&s;cended from their boa&s;ted Jami&s;one. He travelled to
Italy, and in 1718 etched &s;ome plates after Raphael. In 1721 was
printed a letter to a friend at Edinburgh, de&s;cribing a &s;tairca&s;e paint|ed

reputation was, and laborious as his works, he was far from being
generou&s;ly rewarded for &s;ome of them, and for others he found it diffi|cult
to obtain the &s;tipulated prices. His demands were conte&s;ted at
Greenwich, and though La Fo&s;&s;e received <HI>2000l.</HI> for his work at Mon|tagu-hou&s;e

obtain but <HI>40s.</HI> a yard &s;quare for the cupola of St. Paul's, and I think
no more for Greenwich. When the affairs of the South-&s;ea company
were made up, Thornhill, who had painted their &s;tair-ca&s;e and a lit|tle
hall by order of Mr. Knight their ca&s;hier, demanded <HI>1500l.</HI> but
the directors learning that he had been paid but <HI>25s.</HI> a yard for the
hall at Blenheim, they would allow no more. He had a longer con|te&s;t
with Mr. Styles, who had agreed to give him <HI>3500l.</HI> but not
being &s;atisfied with the execution, a law-&s;uit was commenced, and
Dahl, Richard&s;on, and others, were appointed to in&s;pect the work.
They appeared in court, bearing te&s;timony to the merit of the per|formance;
Mr. Styles was condemned to pay the money, and by
their arbitration <HI>500l.</HI> more, for decorations about the hou&s;e and for
Thornhill's acting as &s;urveyor of the building. This &s;uit occa&s;ion|ing

a year had been allowed to the &s;urveyor of Blenheim, be&s;ides travel|ing

By the favour of that general Mecaenas<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It was by the influence of the &s;ame patron that &s;ir James was employed to paint the prince&s;s's apartment at Hampton-court.

publi&s;h an exact account of the whole, for the u&s;e of &s;tudents: but
this work has never appeared. In 1724 he opened an academy for
drawing at his hou&s;e in Covent-garden, and had before propo&s;ed to
lord Halifax to obtain the foundation of a royal academy at the up|per

<P>Afflicted with the gout and his legs &s;welling, he &s;et out for his &s;eat

expired in his chair, May 4, 1734, aged fifty-&s;even, leaving one

original and unequalled genius, Hogarth.</P>

Sir James's collection, among which were a few capital pictures of
the great ma&s;ters, was &s;old in the following year; and with them his

&s;ame collection were drawings by one Andrea, a di&s;ciple of Thorn|hill,
who died about the &s;ame time at Paris.
<Q>ROBERT BROWN</Q>
was a di&s;ciple of Thornhill, and worked under him on the cupola of
St. Paul's. Setting up for him&s;elf, he was much employed in deco|rating
&s;everal churches in the city, being admired for his &s;kill in
painting crim&s;on curtains, apo&s;tles, and &s;tories out of the New Te&s;t|ament.
He painted the altar-piece of St. Andrew Under&s;haft, and
the &s;paces between the gothic arches in chiaro &s;curo. In the pari&s;h
church of St. Botolph, Aldgate, he painted the transfiguration for
the altar; in St. Andrews, Holborn, the figures of St. Andrew and
St. John, and two hi&s;tories on the &s;ides of the organ. In the chapel
of St. John at the end of Bedford-row, he painted St. John the Bap|ti&s;t
and St. John the Evangeli&s;t, and even two &s;igns that were much
admired, that for the Paul's head tavern in Cateaton-&s;treet, and the
Bapti&s;t's head at the corner of Aldermanbury. Correggio's &s;ign of
the muleteer is mentioned by all his biographers. Brown, I doubt,
was no Correggio.

<Q>&mdash;BELLUCCI,</Q>
an Italian painter of hi&s;tory, arrived here in 1716, from the court of
the elector Palatine. In 1722 he fini&s;hed a cieling at Buckingham-hou&s;e,
for which the duche&s;s paid him <HI>500l.</HI> He was al&s;o employed
on the chapel of Canons, that large and co&s;tly palace of the duke of
Chandos, which by a fate as tran&s;ient as its founder's, barely &s;ur|vived
him, being pulled down as &s;oon as he was dead; and, as if in
mockery of &s;ublunary grandeur, the &s;cite and materials were pur|cha&s;ed
by Hallet the cabinet-maker. Though Pope was too grateful
to mean a &s;atire on Canons, while he recorded all its o&s;tentatious
want of ta&s;te, and too &s;incere to have denied it, if he had meant it,
he might without blame have moralized on the event in an epi&s;tle
purely ethic, had he lived to behold its fall and change of ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Bellucci executed &s;ome other works which Vertue does not &s;pecify;
but being afflicted with the gout, quitted this country, leaving a
nephew, who went to Ireland, and made a fortune by painting por|traits
there.
<Q>BALTHAZAR DENNER,</Q>
of Hamburgh, one of tho&s;e laborious arti&s;ts, who&s;e works &s;urpri&s;e
rather than plea&s;e, and who could not be &s;o excellent if they had not
more patience than genius, came hither upon encouragement from
the king, who had &s;een of his works at Hanover and promi&s;ed to &s;it
to him, but Denner &s;ucceding ill in the pictures of two of the fa|vourite
German ladies, he lo&s;t the footing he had expected at court:
<PB N="25" REF="39">
his fame however ro&s;e very high on his exhibiting the head of an old
woman, that he brought over with him, about &s;ixteen inches high
and thirteen wide, in which the grain of the &s;kin, the hairs, the
down, the gla&s;&s;y humour of the eyes, were repre&s;ented with the mo&s;t
exact minutene&s;s. It gained him more applau&s;e than cu&s;tom, for a
man could not execute many works who employed &s;o much time to
fini&s;h them. Nor did he even find a purcha&s;er here; but the em|peror
bought the picture for &s;ix hundred ducats. At Hamburgh he
began a companion to it, an old man, which he brought over and
fini&s;hed here in 1726, and &s;old like the former. He painted him&s;elf,
his wife and children, with the &s;ame circum&s;tantial detail, and a half-length
of him&s;elf, which was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one Swarts, a painter,
totally unknown to me. He re&s;olved however, &s;ays Vertue, to quit
this painful practice and turn to a bolder and le&s;s fini&s;hed &s;tyle; but
whether he did or not is uncertain. He left England in 1728. The
portrait of John Frederic Weickman of Hamburgh, painted by
Denner, is &s;aid to be in the Bodleian library at Oxford.
<Q>&mdash;FERG,</Q>
of Vienna, was a charming painter, who had compo&s;ed a manner
of his own, from various Flemi&s;h painters, though re&s;embling Po|lenburgh
mo&s;t in the enamelled &s;oftne&s;s and mellowne&s;s of his colour|ing:
but his figures are greatly &s;uperior; every part of them is &s;uf|ficiently
fini&s;hed, every action expre&s;&s;ive. He painted &s;mall land|&s;capes,
fairs, and rural meetings, with the mo&s;t agreable truth; his
hor&s;es and cattle are not inferior to Wouvermans, and his buildings
and di&s;tances &s;eem to owe their per&s;pective &s;oftne&s;s to the intervening
<PB N="26" REF="40">
air, not to the pencil. More faithful to nature, than Denner, he
knew how to omit exactne&s;s, when the re&s;ult of the whole demands
a le&s;s preci&s;ion in parts. This plea&s;ing arti&s;t pa&s;&s;ed twenty years
here, but little known, and always indigent. Unhappy in his do|me&s;tic,
he was &s;ometimes in pri&s;on, and never at ea&s;e at home, the
con&s;equence of which was di&s;&s;ipation. He died &s;uddenly in the &s;treet
one night, as he was returning from &s;ome friends, about the year 1737,
having not attained his fiftieth year. He left four children.
<Q>THOMAS GIBSON,</Q>
a man of a mo&s;t amiable character, &s;ays Vertue, had for &s;ome time
great bu&s;ine&s;s, but an ill &s;tate of health for &s;ome years interrupted
his application, and about 1730 he di&s;po&s;ed of his pictures privately
among&s;t his friends. He not long after removed to Oxford, and I
believe practi&s;ed again in London. He died April 28, 1751, aged
about &s;eventy-one. Vertue &s;peaks highly of his integrity and mo|de&s;ty,
and &s;ays he offended his cotemporary arti&s;ts by forbearing
to rai&s;e his prices; and adds, what was not &s;urpri&s;ing in &s;uch con|genial
goodne&s;s, that of all the profe&s;&s;ion Gib&s;on was his mo&s;t &s;in|cere

of drawing from a &s;ign and hou&s;e painter on London-bridge.
But when nature gives real talents, they break forth in the homelie&s;t
&s;chool. The &s;hallow waves that rolled under his window taught
young Monamy what his ma&s;ter could not teach him, and fitted him

brother of John, that exqui&s;ite painter of fruit and flowers, came

than John Huy&s;um, but no man ever yet approached to the
fini&s;hing and roundne&s;s of the latter. James lived a year or two

Angelo Caravaggio, Claud Lorrain, Ga&s;par, and other ma&s;|ters,

It was a little ri&s;e to be employed in copying for dealers, and from
thence he obtained admittance into the academy. His efforts and
ardour at la&s;t carried him to Italy, where he &s;pent three years in
copying portraits of Raphael, Titian, Vandyck, and Rubens, and
improved enough to meet with much bu&s;ine&s;s at his return. When
his indu&s;try and abilities had thus &s;urmounted the a&s;perities of his

afterwards bi&s;hop of Cloyne, who&s;e benevolent heart was then
warmly &s;et on the erection of an univer&s;al college of &s;cience and arts
in Bermudas, for the in&s;truction of heathen children in chri&s;tian du|ties

lord Byron. With Jo&s;eph Goupy he was prevailed upon to paint a
&s;et of &s;cenes for the opera, which were much admired. After la|bouring
many years under an a&s;thma, for which he chiefly re&s;ided at
Richmond, he died at Norton in Suffolk December 5, 1734, at about
the fiftieth year of his age.
<Q>JOHN VANDREBANK,</Q>
a painter much in fa&s;hion in the reigns of the two la&s;t kings, is &s;aid
by Vertue to be an Engli&s;hman (though by his name at lea&s;t of fo|reign
extraction) and to have attained his &s;kill without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from &s;tudy abroad. Had he not been carele&s;s and extravagant, &s;ays
my author, he might have made a greater figure than almo&s;t any
painter this nation had produced; &s;o bold and free was his pencil and
&s;o ma&s;terly his drawing. He died of a con&s;umption when he was
not above forty-five, in Hollis-&s;treet, Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, December
23, 1739. John Vandrebank gave the de&s;igns of a &s;et of plates for
Don Quixote. He had a brother of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion; and a
cou&s;in, called
<Q>SAMUEL BARKER,</Q>
whom he in&s;tructed in the art, but who having a talent for painting
fruit and flowers, imitated Bapti&s;t, and would probably have made
a good ma&s;ter, but died young in 1727.
<PB N="33" REF="49">
<Q>PETER VAN BLEECK,</Q>
came into England in 1723, and was reckoned a good painter of
portraits. There is a $ine mezzotinto, done in the following reign,
from a picture which he painted of tho&s;e excellent comedians, John|&s;on
and Griffin, in the characters of Ananias and Tribulation, in the
Alchymi&s;t. I have mentioned John&s;on in this work before, as the
mo&s;t natural actor I ever &s;aw. Griffin's eye and tone were a little
too comic, and betrayed his inward mirth, though his mu&s;cles were
&s;trictly &s;teady. Mr. We&s;ton is not inferior to John&s;on in the firm|ne&s;s
of his countenance, though le&s;s univer&s;al, as John&s;on was
equally great in &s;ome tragic characters. In bi&s;hop Gardiner he &s;up|ported
the in&s;olent dignity of a per&s;ecutor; and compleatly a prie&s;t,
&s;hifted it in an in&s;tant to the fawning in&s;incerity of a &s;lave, as &s;oon
as Henry frowned. This was indeed hi&s;tory, when Shake&s;peare
wrote it, and John&s;on repre&s;ented it. When we read it in fictitious
harangues and wordy declamation, it is a tale told by a pedant to a
&s;chool-boy. Vanbleeck died July 20, 1764.
<Q>H. VANDERMIJN,</Q>
another Dutch painter, came over recommended by lord Cadogan
the general, and in his manner carried to exce&s;s the laborious minute|ne&s;s
of his countrymen; faithfully imitating the details of lace, em|broidery,
fringes, and even the threads of &s;tockings. Yet even this
accuracy in artificial trifles, which is often prai&s;ed by the people as
<HI>natural,</HI> nor the protection of the court, could e&s;tabli&s;h his reputa|tion
<PB N="34" REF="50">
as a good ma&s;ter; though perhaps the time he wa&s;ted on his
works, in which at lea&s;t he was the rever&s;e of his &s;latternly contempo|raries,
prevented his enriching him&s;elf as they did. In hi&s;tory he is
&s;aid to have had greater merit. He was more fortunate in receiving
<HI>500l.</HI> for repairing the paintings at Burleigh. The prince of
Orange &s;at to him, and he &s;ucceeded &s;o well in the likene&s;s, that
the late prince of Wales not only &s;ent for him to draw his picture,
but prevailed on his &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s of Orange to draw Vander|mijn's;
for her royal highne&s;s, as well as prince&s;s Caroline, both
honoured the art by their performances in crayons. This &s;ingular
di&s;tinction was not the only one Vandermijn received; George the
fir&s;t, and the late king and queen, then prince and prince&s;s, an&s;wer|ed
for his &s;on, a hopeful lad, who was lo&s;t at the age of &s;ixteen, by
the breaking of the ice as he was &s;cating at Marybone, at the end of
the grea&s;t fro&s;t in 1740. Vandermijn had a &s;i&s;ter called Agatha,
who came over with him, and painted fruit, flowers, and dead fowls.
I do not find in what year he died.
<Q>ENOCH ZEEMAN.</Q>
Vertue has pre&s;erved few anecdotes of this painter, whom I remem|ber
in much bu&s;ine&s;s. His father and three brothers followed the
&s;ame profe&s;&s;ion; one of them in water-colours; but Enoch was mo&s;t
in fa&s;hion. At nineteen he painted his own portrait in the finical
manner of Denner, and executed the heads of an old man and wo|man
in the &s;ame &s;tyle afterwards. He died &s;uddenly in 1744, leav|ing
a &s;on, called Paul, who followed the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion. I&s;aac

Zeeman, brother of Enoch, died April 4, 1751, leaving al&s;o a &s;on
who was a painter.
<Q>WATTEAU.</Q>
England has very &s;lender preten&s;ions to this original and engaging
painter; he having come hither only to con&s;ult Dr. Meade, for
whom he painted two pictures, that were &s;old in the doctor's col|lection.
The genius of Watteau re&s;embled that of his countryman
D'urf&egrave;; the one drew and the other wrote of imaginary nymphs and
&s;wains, and de&s;cribed a kind of impo&s;&s;ible pa&s;toral, a rural life led
by tho&s;e oppo&s;ites of rural &s;implicity, people of fa&s;hion and rank.
Watteau's &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, nay, his very &s;heep, are coquet; yet he
avoided the glare and clinquant of his countrymen; and though he
fell &s;hort of the dignified grace of the Italians, there is an ea&s;y air
in his figures, and that more familiar &s;pecies of the graceful, which
we call genteel. His nymphs are as much below the forbidding ma|je&s;ty
of godde&s;&s;es, as they are above the hoyden awkwardne&s;s of
country-girls. In his halts and marches of armies, the carele&s;s &s;louch
of his &s;oldiers &s;till retain the air of a nation that a&s;pires to be agrea|ble
as well as victorious.</P>
<P>But there is one fault of Watteau, for which till lately I could
never account. His trees appear as unnatural to our eyes, as his
figures mu&s;t do to a real pea&s;ant who had never &s;tirred beyond his
village. In my late journies to Paris the cau&s;e of this grievous ab|&s;urdity
was apparent to me, though nothing can excu&s;e it. Wat|teau's
trees are copied from tho&s;e of the Tuilleries and villas near
Paris; a &s;trange &s;cene to &s;tudy nature in! There I &s;aw the originals
of tho&s;e tufts of plumes and fans, and trimmed-up groves, that nod
<PB N="36" REF="54">
to one another like the &s;cenes of an opera. Fanta&s;tic people! who
range and fa&s;hion their trees, and teach them to hold up their heads,
as a dancing-ma&s;ter would, if he expected Orpheus &s;hould return
to play a minuet to them.
<Q>ROBERT WOODCOCK,</Q>
of a gentleman's family, became a painter by genius and inclination.
He had a place under the government, which he quitted to devote
him&s;elf to his art, which he practiced &s;olely on &s;ea-pieces. He drew
in that way from his childhood, and &s;tudied the technical part of
&s;hips with &s;o much attention, that he could cut out a &s;hip with all
the ma&s;ts and rigging to the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. In 1723 he began to
practice in oil, and in two years copied above forty pictures of Van|develde.
With &s;o good a foundation he openly profe&s;&s;ed the art,
and his improvements were &s;o rapid that the duke of Chandos gave
him thirty guineas for one of his pieces. Nor was his talent for mu|&s;ic
le&s;s remarkable. He both played on the hautboy and compo&s;ed,
and &s;ome of his compo&s;itions in &s;everal parts were publi&s;hed. But
the&s;e promi&s;ing abilities were cut off e'er they had reached their
maturity, by that enemy of the ingenious and &s;edentary, the gout.
He died April 10, 1728, in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his age, and
was buried at Chel&s;ea.
<Q>ISAAC WHOOD</Q>
painted portraits in oil, and in black-lead on vellom, chiefly profiles.
He was patronized by Worthe&s;ley duke of Bedford, and has left
<PB N="37" REF="55">
&s;everal of his works at Woburn-abbey. He died in Bloom&s;bury|&s;quare,
February 24, 1752, aged &s;ixty-three. He was remarkable
for his humour, and happy application of pa&s;&s;ages in Hudibras.
<Q>&mdash;VOGELSANG,</Q>
of what country I know not, was a land&s;cape-painter, who went to
Ireland, where he had good bu&s;ine&s;s; but leaving it to go to Scot|land,
was not equally &s;ucce&s;sful, and returned to London. The&s;e
are all the traces I find of him in Vertue's notes.
<Q>&mdash;ZURICH,</Q>
of Dre&s;den, was &s;on of a jeweller, who bred him to his own bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
but giving him &s;ome in&s;tructions in drawing too, the young
man preferred the latter, and applied him&s;elf to miniature and enam|elling.
He &s;tudied in the academy of Berlin, and came to Eng|land
about 1715, where he met with encouragement, though now
forgotten, and ob&s;cured by his countryman that &s;econd Petitot,
Zincke, whom I &s;hall mention in the next reign. Zurich died about
Chri&s;tmas 1735, in the fiftieth year of his age, and was buried near
the Lutheran church in the Savoy, leaving a &s;on about twelve years
old. Frederic Peter&s;on was an enameller about the &s;ame time, and
died in 1729.
<PB N="38" REF="56">
<Q>CHRISTIAN RICHTER,</Q>
&s;on of a &s;ilver&s;mith at Stockholm, came over in 1702 and practiced
in oil, chiefly &s;tudying the works of Dahl, from which he learned a
&s;trong manner of colouring, and which he tran&s;planted into his
miniatures, for which he is be&s;t known. In the latter part of his
life he applied to enamelling, but died, before he had made great
proficience in that branch, in November, 1732, at about the age of
fifty. He had &s;everal brothers, arti&s;ts, one a medalli&s;t at Vienna,
and another at Venice, a painter of views. Richter was member of
a club with Dahl and &s;everal gentlemen, who&s;e heads his brother
modelled by the life, and from thence made medals in &s;ilver. I
mention this as it may explain to collectors the origine of tho&s;e me|dals,
when they are met with. Sir William Rich, Grey Neville,
and others, were of the club, and I think &s;ome foreign gentlemen.
<Q>JACQUES ANTOINE ARLAUD</Q>
was born at Geneva, May 18, 1668, and was de&s;igned for the
church, but poverty obliged him to turn painter. At the age of
twenty he quitted Geneva, worked at Dijon, and from thence re|paired
to Paris, where, &s;ucceeding in miniature, he was approved
of by the academy and countenanced by the king. The regent ad|mired
him &s;till more&mdash;I am almo&s;t afraid to repeat what follows, &s;o
much exaggeration &s;eems to have been mixed with the account.
Having copied a Leda, my author &s;ays from a ba&s;relief of Michael
Angelo, I rather &s;uppo&s;e it was the famous Leda of Correggio de|&s;troyed
<PB REF="57">
<FIGURE>
<P>JAMES ANTHONY ARLAUD</P>

<PB N="39" REF="58">
by the bigotry of the regent's &s;on, all Paris was &s;truck with
the performance. The due de la Force gave twelve thou&s;and livres
for it, but the duke being a &s;ufferer by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi [probably be|fore
the picture was paid for] re&s;tored it to Arlaud, with 4000 li|vres
for the time he had enjoyed it. In 1721 Arlaud brought this
chef d'oeuvre to London, but would not &s;ell it&mdash;but &s;old a copy of
it, &s;ays the &s;ame author, for &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling. This fact
is quite incredible. The painter was at lea&s;t &s;o much admired, that
he received many pre&s;ents of medals, which are &s;till in the library of
Geneva. But poor Leda was again condemned to be the victim of
devotion&mdash;in 1738 Arlaud him&s;elf de&s;troyed her in a fit of piety, yet
&s;till with &s;o much parental fondne&s;s, that he cut her to pieces ana|tomically.
This happened at Geneva. Mon&s;. de Champeau, then
re&s;ident there from France, obtained the head and one foot of the di&s;|&s;ected;
a lady got an arm. The comte de Lautrec, then at Geneva,
and not quite &s;o &s;crupulous, rated Arlaud for demoli&s;hing &s;o fine a
work. The painter died May 25, 1743. The&s;e particularities are
extracted from the poems of Mon&s;. de Bar, printed at Am&s;terdam in
3 volumes, 1750. In the third volume is an ode on the Leda in
que&s;tion. Vertue &s;peaks incidentally of the noi&s;e this picture made in
London, but &s;ays nothing of the extravagant price of the copy. The
duche&s;s of Montagu has a head of her father when young, and ano|ther
of her grandfather the great duke of Marlborough, both in wa|ter-colours
by Arlaud. The celebrated count Hamilton wrote a little
poem to him on his portrait of the pretender's &s;i&s;ter. <HI>See his works,

<Q>Mrs. HOADLEY,</Q>
who&s;e maiden name was Sarah Curtis, was di&s;ciple of Mrs. Beal,
and a paintre&s;s of portraits by profe&s;&s;ion, when &s;he was &s;o happy as
to become the wife of that great and good man, Dr. Hoadley, af|terwards
bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. From that time &s;he only practiced
the art for her amu&s;ement; though if we may judge of her talents
by the print from her portrait of Whi&s;ton, the art lo&s;t as much as
&s;he gained&mdash;but o&s;tentation was below the &s;implicity of character
that enobled that excellent family. She died in 1743. In the libra|ry

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Architects and other Arti&s;ts, in the Reign of George I.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tages of no art have been more di&s;tinctly marked than
tho&s;e of architecture in Britain. It is not probable that our
ma&s;ters the Romans ever taught us more than the con&s;truction of
arches. Tho&s;e, impo&s;ed on clu&s;ters of di&s;proportioned pillars, com|po&s;ed
the whole grammar of our Saxon ance&s;tors. Churches and
ca&s;tles were the only buildings, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, they erected of
&s;tone. As no ta&s;te was be&s;towed on the former, no beauty was
&s;ought in the latter. Ma&s;&s;es to re&s;i&s;t, and uncouth towers for keep|ing
watch, were all the conveniencies they demanded. As even
luxury was not &s;ecure but in a church, &s;ucceeding refinements were
&s;olely laid out on religious fabrics, till by degrees was perfected the
bold &s;cenery of Gothic architecture, with all its airy embroidery and
pen&s;ile vaults. Holbein, as I have &s;hown, checked that fal&s;e, yet
venerable &s;tyle, and fir&s;t attempted to &s;ober it to cla&s;&s;ic mea&s;ures;
but not having gone far enough, his imitators, without his ta&s;te,
compounded a mungrel &s;pecies, that had no boldne&s;s, no lightne&s;s,
and no &s;y&s;tem. This la&s;ted till Inigo Jones, like his countryman
<PB N="42" REF="61">
and cotemporary Milton, di&s;$lo&s;ed the beauties of ancient Greece,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;implicity, harmony, and proportion. That &s;chool
however was too cha&s;te to flouri&s;h long. Sir Chri&s;topher Wren lived
to &s;ee it almo&s;t expire before him; and after a mixture of French
and Dutch ugline&s;s had expelled truth, without erecting any certain
&s;tyle in its &s;tead, Vanbrugh with his ponderous and unmeaning
ma&s;&s;es overwhelmed architecture in meer ma&s;onry. Will po&s;terity
believe that &s;uch piles were erected in the very period when St. Paul's
was fini&s;hing?</P>
<P>Vanbrugh's immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors had no ta&s;te, yet &s;ome of them
did not forget that there was &s;uch a &s;cience as regular architecture.
Still there was a Mr. Archer, the groom-porter, who built Hethrop,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">St. Philip's church at Birmingham, Cliefden-hou&s;e, and a hou&s;e at Roe|hampton, (which as a &s;pecimen of his wretched ta&s;te may be &s;een in the Vitru|vius Britannicus) were other works of the &s;ame per&s;on; but the chef d'oeuvre of his ab&s;urdity was the church of St. John with four belfrys in We&s;tmin&s;ter.</NOTE>
and a temple at Wre&s;t; and one Wakefield, who gave the de&s;ign of
Helm&s;ley; each of whom &s;eemed to think that Vanbrugh had deli|vered
the art from &s;hackles, and that they might build whatever
&s;eemed good in their own eyes. Yet before I mention the &s;truggles
made by the art to re&s;ume its ju&s;t empire, there was a di&s;ciple of Sir
Chri&s;topher Wren that ought not to be forgotten; his name was
<Q>NICHOLAS HAWKSMOOR.</Q>
At eighteen he became the &s;cholar of Wren, under whom during his
life, and on his own account after his ma&s;ter's death, he was con|cerned
<PB N="43" REF="62">
in erecting many public edifices. So early as Charles's reign
he was &s;upervi&s;or of the palace at Winche&s;ter, and under the &s;ame
eminent architect a&s;&s;i&s;ted in conducting the works at St. Paul's to
their conclu&s;ion. He was deputy-&s;urveyor at the building Chel|&s;ea-college,
and clerk of the works at Greenwich, and was conti|nued
in the &s;ame po&s;t by king William, queen Anne, and George
the fir&s;t, at Ken&s;ington, Whitehall, and St. James's; and under
the latter prince was fir&s;t &s;urveyor of all the new churches and of
We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey from the death of Sir Chri&s;topher, and de&s;igned
&s;everal of the temples that were erected in pur&s;uance of the &s;ta|tute
of queen Anne for rai&s;ing fifty new churches; their names are,
St. Mary Woolnoth, in Lombard-&s;treet; Chri&s;t-church, Spital-fields;
St. George, Middle&s;ex; St. Anne, Limehou&s;e; and St. George,
Bloom&s;bury; the &s;teeple of which is a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of ab&s;urdity,
con&s;i&s;ting of an obeli&s;k, crowned with the &s;tatue of king George the
Fir&s;t, and hugged by the royal &s;upporters. A lion, an unicorn, and
a king on &s;uch an eminence are very &s;urpri&s;ing:
<Q><L>The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,</L>
<L>But wonder how the devil they got there.</L></Q>
He al&s;o rebuilt &s;ome part of All-Souls college<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Clarke, member for Oxford, and benefactor to that univer&s;ity, built three &s;ides of the &s;quare called Peckwater at Chri&s;t-church, and the church of All Saints in the high &s;treet there.</NOTE>, Oxford, the two
towers over the gate of which are copies of his own &s;teeple of St.
Anne, Limehou&s;e. At Blenheim and Ca&s;tle-Howard he was a&s;&s;o|ciated
with Vanbrugh, at the latter of which he was employed in
erecting the magnificent mau&s;oleum there when he died. He built
<PB N="44" REF="63">
&s;everal con&s;iderable hou&s;es for various per&s;ons, particularly Ea&s;ton
Ne&s;ton in Northampton&s;hire; re&s;tored a defect in the min&s;ter of
Beverley, by a machine of his own invention<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Of that machine by which he &s;erewed up the fabric with extraordinary art, there was a print publi&s;hed.</NOTE>; repaired in a judi|cious
manner the we&s;t end of We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey; and gave a de|&s;ign
for the Ratcliffe library at Oxford. His knowledge in every
&s;cience connected with his art is much commended, and his character
remains unblemi&s;hed. He died March 25, 1736, aged near &s;eventy.
The above particulars are taken from an account of him given in
the public papers, and &s;uppo&s;ed by Vertue to be drawn up by his
&s;on-in-law Mr. Blackerby. Many of the encomiums I omit, becau&s;e
this is intended as an impartial regi&s;ter of, not as a panegyric on,
our arti&s;ts. When I have erred on either &s;ide, in commending or
blaming, I offer but my own judgment, which is authority to no|body
el&s;e, and ought to be canva&s;&s;ed or &s;et right by abler deci&s;ions.
Hawk&s;moor deviated a little from the le&s;&s;ons and practice of his
ma&s;ter, and certainly did not improve on them; but the mo&s;t di&s;|&s;tingui&s;hed
architect was
<Q>JAMES GIBBS,</Q>
who without deviating from e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, proved what has been
&s;een in other arts, that meer mechanic knowledge may avoid faults,
without furni&s;hing beauties; that grace does not depend on rules;
and that ta&s;te is not to be learnt. Virgil and Statius u&s;ed the &s;ame
number of feet in their ver&s;es; and Gibbs knew the proportions of
<PB REF="64">
<FIGURE>
<P>JAMES GIBBS.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="45" REF="65">
the five orders as well as Inigo; yet the Banquetting-hou&s;e is a &s;tand|ard,
and no man talks of one edifice of Gibbs. In all is wanting
that harmonious &s;implicity that &s;peaks a genius&mdash;and that is often
not remarked till it has been approved of by one. It is that grace
and that truth, &s;o much meditated, and delivered at once with &s;uch
correctne&s;s and ea&s;e in the works of the ancients, which good &s;en&s;e
admires and con&s;ecrates, becau&s;e it corre&s;ponds with nature. Their
&s;mall temples and &s;tatues, like their writings, charm every age by
their &s;ymmetry and graces and the ju&s;t mea&s;ure of what is nece&s;&s;ary;
while pyramids and the ruins of Per&s;epolis, only make the vulgar
&s;tare at their gigantic and clum&s;y grandeur. Gibbs, like Vanbrugh,
had no aver&s;ion to pondero&s;ity, but not being endued with much in|vention,
was only regularly heavy. His prai&s;e was fidelity to rules;
his failing, want of grace.</P>
<P>He was born at Aberdeen in 1683, and &s;tudied his art in Italy.
About the year 1720 he became the architect mo&s;t in vogue, and
the next year gave the de&s;ign of St. Martin's church, which was
fini&s;hed in five years, and co&s;t thirty-two thou&s;and pounds. His like|wi&s;e
was St. Mary's in the Strand, one of the fifty new churches, a
monument of the piety more than of the ta&s;te of the nation. The
new church at Derby was another of his works; &s;o was the new
building at King's college, Cambridge, and the &s;enate-hou&s;e there,
the latter of which was not &s;o bad as to ju&s;tify erecting the middle
building in a &s;tyle very di&s;&s;onant. The Ratcliffe library<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At the opening the library, Gibbs was complimented by the univer&s;ity with the degree of ma&s;ter of arts.</NOTE> is more
exceptionable, and &s;eems to have &s;unk into the ground; or, as
Sarah Duche&s;s of Marlborough &s;aid of another building, it looks as
<PB N="46" REF="66">
if it was making a curt&s;y. Gibbs, though he knew little of Gothic
architecture, was more fortunate in the quadrangle of All Souls,
which has blundered into a picture&s;que &s;cenery not void of grandeur,
e&s;pecially if &s;een through the gate that leads from the &s;chools. The
a&s;&s;emblage of buildings in that quarter, though no &s;ingle one is
beautiful, always &s;truck me with &s;ingular plea&s;ure, as it conveys
&s;uch a vi&s;ion of large edifices, unbroken by private hou&s;es, as the
mind is apt to entertain of renowned cities that exi&s;t no longer.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is the &s;ame kind of vi&s;ionary enchantment that &s;trikes in the gardens at Stowe. Though &s;ome of the buildings, particularly tho&s;e of Vanbrugh and Gibbs, are far from beautiful, yet the rich land&s;capes occa&s;ioned by the multi|plicity of temples and obeli&s;ks, and the various pictures that pre&s;ent them&s;elves as we &s;hift our &s;ituation, occa&s;ion &s;urprize and plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes recalling Albano's land&s;capes to our mind, and oftener to our fancy the idolatrous and luxurious vales of Daphne and Tempe. It is ju&s;t to add that the improvements made by lord Temple have profited of the pre&s;ent perfect &s;tyle of architecture and gardening. The temple of Concord and Victory pre&s;iding over &s;o noble a valley, the great arch de&s;igned by Mr. T. Pitt, and the &s;maller in honour of prince&s;s Amelie, di&s;clo&s;ing a wonderfully beautiful per&s;pective over the Ely&s;ian fields to the Palladian bridge, and up to the ca&s;tle on the hill, are monuments of ta&s;te, and &s;cenes, that I much que&s;tion if Tempe or Daphne exhibited.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1728 Gibbs publi&s;hed a large folio of his own de&s;igns, which I
think will confirm the character I have given of his works. His
arched windows, his ru&s;tic-laced windows, his barbarous buildings
for gardens, his cumbrous chimney-pieces, and va&s;es without grace,
are &s;triking proofs of his want of ta&s;te. He got 1500 <HI>l.</HI> by this pub|lication,
and &s;old the plates afterwards for 400 <HI>l.</HI> more. His repu|tation
was however e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the following compliment, pre|&s;erved

There are three prints of Gibbs, one from a picture of Huy&s;&s;ing, and
another from one of Schryder, a Swi&s;s, who was afterwards painter
to the king of Sweden, and the third from Hogarth. Gibbs was
afflicted with the gravel and &s;tone and went to Spa in 1749, but did
not die till Augu&s;t 5, 1754. He bequeathed an hundred pounds to
St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital, of which he was architect and governor,
the &s;ame to the Foundling ho&s;pital, and his library and prints to the
Ratcliffe library at Oxford, be&s;ides charities, and legacies to his re|lations
and friends.
<Q>COLIN CAMPBELL,</Q>
$ countryman of Gibbs, had fewer faults, but not more imagination.
He publi&s;hed three large folios under the title of Vitruvius Britan|nicus,
containing many of his own de&s;igns, with plans of other ar|chitects;
but he did not for&s;ee with how much more ju&s;tice that title
would be worn by &s;ucceeding volumes to be added to his works.
One has already been given. The be&s;t of Campbell's de&s;igns, are
Wan&s;tead, the Rolls, and Mereworth in Kent: the latter avowedly
copied from Palladio. Campbell was &s;urveyor of the works at
Greenwich ho&s;pital, and died in 1734.
<PB N="48" REF="68" MS="Y">
<Q>JOHN JAMES,</Q>
of whom I find no mention in Vertue's notes, was, as I am inform|ed,
con&s;iderably employed in the works at Greenwich; where he
&s;ettled. He built the church there, and the hou&s;e for &s;ir Gregory
Page at Blackheath, the idea of which was taken from Houghton.
James likewi&s;e built the church of St. George Hanover-&s;quare, the
body of the church at Twickenham, and that of St. Luke, Middle|&s;ex,
which has a fluted obeli&s;k for its &s;teeple. He tran&s;lated from
the French &s;ome books on gardening.
<Q>&mdash;CARPENTIERE,</Q>
or Charpentiere, a &s;tatuary much employed by the duke of Chandos
at Canons, was for &s;ome years principal a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Van O&s;t, an ar|ti&s;t
of whom I have found no memorials, and afterwards &s;et up for
him&s;elf. Towards the end of his life, he kept a manufacture of
leaden &s;tatues in Piccadilly, and died in 1737, aged above &s;ixty.
<Q>CHARLES CHRISTIAN REISEN,</Q>
the celebrated engraver of &s;eals, was &s;on of Chri&s;tian Rei&s;en of
Drontheim in Norway<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The father, on his voyage to England, had been driven by a &s;torm to Scotland, and worked at Aberdeen for one Melvin, a gold&s;mith, for two years before he came to London, where he arrived on the &s;econd day of the great fire in September, 1666. Here he fir&s;t began to engrave &s;eals, having been only a gold&s;mith before. Afterwards he was confined in the Tower for four years on &s;u&s;picion of engraving dies for coining, but was di&s;charged without a trial.</NOTE>, who had followed the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, and

</FIGURE>
<PB N="49" REF="70">
who with one Stykes were the fir&s;t arti&s;ts of that kind who had di&s;|tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves in England. The father died here leaving a
widow and a numerous family, the elde&s;t of which was Charles
Chri&s;tian, who though &s;carce twenty had made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s un|der
his father's in&s;tructions, that he became the &s;upport of the family,
and in a few years equalled any modern that had attempted the art of
intaglia. He was born in the pari&s;h of St. Clement's Danes, and on
account of his extraction was recommended to prince George, but
being little ver&s;ed in the language of his family, does not appear to
have been particularly encouraged by his royal highne&s;s. The force
of his genius however attracted the notice of &s;uch a patron as genius
de&s;erved, and always found at that time, Robert earl of Oxford,
who&s;e munificence and recommendation &s;oon placed Chri&s;tian (by
which name he is be&s;t known) on the ba&s;is of fortune and fame. In
the library and mu&s;eum of that noble collector he found all the helps
that a very deficient education had deprived him of; there he learned
to &s;ee with Grecian and Roman eyes, and to produce heads after
the antique worthy of his models; for though greatly employed on
cutting arms and cre&s;ts, and &s;uch ta&s;tele&s;s fanta&s;ies, his excellence
lay in imitating the heroes and empre&s;&s;es of antiquity. I do not find
that he ever attempted cameo. The magic of tho&s;e works, in
which by the help of gla&s;&s;es we di&s;cover all the beauties of &s;tatuary
and drawing, and even the &s;cience of anatomy, has been re&s;tricted to
an age that was ignorant of micro&s;copic gla&s;&s;es; a problem hitherto
<PB N="50" REF="71">
unre&s;olved to &s;atisfaction. Chri&s;tian's fame &s;pread beyond the con|fines
of our i&s;land, and he received frequent commi&s;&s;ions from Den|mark,
Germany, and France. Chri&s;tian, as his fortune and ta&s;te
improved, made a collection him&s;elf of medals, prints, drawings
and books; and was cho&s;en director of the academy under &s;ir God|frey
Kneller. On the trial of bi&s;hop Atterbury, on a que&s;tion relat|ing
to the impre&s;&s;ion of a &s;eal, he was thought the be&s;t judge, and
was examined accordingly. Vertue repre&s;ents him as a man of a
jovial and free, and even &s;arca&s;tic temper and of much humour, an
in&s;tance of which was, that being illiterate, but conver&s;ing with men
of various countries, he had compo&s;ed a dialect &s;o droll and divert|ing,
that it grew into a kind of u&s;e among his acquaintance, and he
threatened to publi&s;h a dictionary of it. His countenance harmo|nized
with his humour, and Chri&s;tian's mazard was a con&s;tant joke;
a circum&s;tance not worth mentioning, no more than the lines it occa|&s;ioned,
but as they fell from the pen of that engaging writer, Mr.
Prior. Sir James Thornhill having drawn an extempore profile of
Chri&s;tian, the poet added this di&s;tich,
<Q><L>This, drawn by candle-light and hazard,</L>
<L>Was meant to &s;how Charles Chri&s;tian's mazard.</L></Q>
This great arti&s;t lived chiefly in the neighbourhood of Covent-garden,
&s;o long the re&s;idence of mo&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ors in virt&ugrave;. He died there
of the gout, December 15, 1725, when he had not pa&s;&s;ed the forty-&s;ixth
year of his age, and was buried in the church-yard on the north
&s;ide next to the &s;teps. He appointed his friend &s;ir James Thornhill
one of his executors, and dying a batchelor left the bulk of his for|tune
to a maiden &s;i&s;ter who had con&s;tantly lived with him, and a por|tion
to his brother John.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of King GEORGE II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with complacency I enter upon a more &s;hining period in the
hi&s;tory of arts, upon a new aera; for though painting made but
feeble efforts towards advancement, yet it was in the reign of George
the Second that architecture revived in antique purity; and that an
art unknown to every age and climate not only &s;tarted into being,
but advanced with ma&s;ter-&s;teps to vigorous perfection, I mean, the
art of gardening, or as I &s;hould chu&s;e to call it, <HI>the art of creat|ing
land&s;cape.</HI> Ry&s;brack and Roubiliac redeemed &s;tatuary from re|proach,
and engraving began to demand better painters, who&s;e works
it might imitate. The king, it is true, had little propen&s;ity to re|fined
plea&s;ures; but queen Caroline was ever ready to reward merit,
and wi&s;hed to have their reign illu&s;trated by monuments of genius.
She en&s;hrined Newton, Boyle, and Locke: &s;he employed Kent,
and &s;at to Zincke. Pope might have enjoyed her favour, and Swift
had it at fir&s;t, till in&s;olent under the ma&s;k of independence, and not
content without domineering over her politics, &s;he abandoned him
<PB N="52" REF="73">
to his ill-humour, and to the vexation of that mi&s;guided and di&s;ap|pointed
ambition, that perverted and preyed on his excellent genius.</P>
<P>To have an exact view of &s;o long a reign as that of George the
Second, it mu&s;t be remembered that many of the arti&s;ts already re|corded
lived pa&s;t the beginning of it, and were principal performers.
Thus the &s;tyle that had predominated both in painting and architec|ture
in the two preceding reigns, &s;till exi&s;ted during the fir&s;t years of
the late king, and may be con&s;idered as the remains of the &s;chools of
Dahl and &s;ir Godfrey Kneller, and of &s;ir Chri&s;topher Wren. Rich|ard&s;on
and Jervas, Gibbs and Campbell, were &s;till at the head of
their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ions. Each art improved, before the old pro|fe&s;&s;ors
left the &s;tage. Vanloo introduced a better &s;tyle of draperies,
which by the help of Vanaken became common to and indeed the
&s;ame in the works of almo&s;t all our painters; and Leoni, by pub|li&s;hing
and imitating Palladio, di&s;encumbered architecture from &s;ome
of the weight with which it had been overloaded. Kent, lord Bur|lington,
and lord Pembroke, though the two fir&s;t were no foes to
heavy ornaments, re&s;tored every other grace to that impo&s;ing &s;cience,
and left the art in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its rights&mdash;yet &s;till Mr. Adam and
Mr. Chambers were wanting to give it perfect delicacy. The reign
was not clo&s;ed, when &s;ir Jo&s;hua Reynolds ran&s;omed portrait-painting
from in&s;ipidity, and would have excelled the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in that
branch, if his colouring were as la&s;ting, as his ta&s;te and imagination
are inexhau&s;tible&mdash;but I mean not to &s;peak of living ma&s;ters,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This is the rea&s;on why no account is given here of that able ma&s;ter Mr. Scott, painter of &s;ea-pieces, who ought to make a principal figure in this reign.</NOTE> and
<PB N="53" REF="74" MS="Y">
mu&s;t therefore omit &s;ome of the ornaments of that reign. Tho&s;e I
&s;hall fir&s;t recapitulate were not the mo&s;t meritorious.
<Q>HANS HUYSSING,</Q>
born at Stockholm, came over in 1700, and lived many years with
Dahl, who&s;e manner he imitated and retained. He drew the three
elde&s;t prince&s;&s;es, daughters of the king, in the robes they wore at
the coronation.
<Q>CHARLES COLLINS</Q>
painted all &s;orts of fowl and game. He drew a piece with a hare
and birds and his own portrait in a hat. He died in 1744.
<Q>&mdash;COOPER</Q>
imitated Michael Angelo di Caravaggio in painting fruit and flowers.
He died towards the end of 1743.
<Q>BARTHOLOMEW DANDRIDGE,</Q>
&s;on of a hou&s;e-painter, had great bu&s;ine&s;s from his felecity in taking
a likene&s;s. He &s;ometimes painted &s;mall conver&s;ations, but died in
the vigour of his age.
<PB N="54" REF="75">
<Q>&mdash;DAMINI,</Q>
an Italian painter of hi&s;tory, was &s;cholar of Pelegrini. He returned
to his own country in 1730, in company with Mr. Hu&s;&s;ey, who&s;e
genius for drawing was thought equal to very great ma&s;ters.
<Q>JEREMIAH DAVISON</Q>
was born in England, of Scots parents. He chiefly &s;tudied &s;ir
Peter Lely, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Vanaken, excelled in paint|ing
&s;attins. Having got acquainted with the duke of Athol at a
lodge of free-ma&s;ons, he painted his grace's picture and pre&s;ented it
to the &s;ociety. The duke &s;at to him again with his duche&s;s, and pa|tronized
and carried him into Scotland, where, as well as in London,
he had great bu&s;ine&s;s. He died the latter end of 1745, aged about
fifty.
<Q>JOHN ELLIS,</Q>
born in 1701, was at fifteen placed with &s;ir James Thornhill, and
afterwards was a &s;hort time with Schmutz; but he chiefly imitated
Vandrebank, to who&s;e hou&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s he &s;ucceeded; and by the
favour of the duke of Montagu, great ma&s;ter of the wardrobe, pur|cha&s;ed
Vandrebank's place of tape&s;try-weaver to the crown, as by
the intere&s;t of &s;ir Robert Walpole, for whom he bought pictures, he
was appointed ma&s;ter-keeper of the lions in the Tower. In the&s;e
ea&s;y circum&s;tances he was not very a&s;&s;iduous in his profe&s;&s;ion.

<P>PHILIP MERCIER.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="55" REF="77">
<Q>PHILIP MERCIER,</Q>
of French extraction, but born at Berlin, &s;tudied there in the acade|my
and under mon&s;ieur Pe&s;ne. After vi&s;iting France and Italy he
went to Hanover, where he drew prince Frederic's picture, which
he brought to England, and when his royal highne&s;s came over,
Mercier was appointed his painter, became a favourite and was ta|ken
into his &s;ervice and hou&s;hold; and by the prince's order drew
&s;everal of the royal family, particularly the three elde&s;t prince&s;&s;es,
which pictures were publi&s;hed in mezzotinto. After nine years, he
lo&s;t the favour of the prince of Wales, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his
&s;ervice. At fir&s;t he talked of quitting his profe&s;&s;ion, retired into the
country, and bought a &s;mall e&s;tate; but &s;oon returned and took a
hou&s;e in Covent-garden, painting portraits and pictures of familiar
life in a genteel &s;tyle of his own, and with a little of Watteau, in
who&s;e manner there is an etching of Mercier and his wife and two
of their children. There is another print of his daughter. Children
too and their &s;ports he painted for prints. From London he went to
York, and met with encouragement, and for a &s;hort time to Portu|gal
and Ireland; and died July 18, 1760, aged &s;eventy-one.
<Q>JOSEPH FRANCIS NOLLIKINS,</Q>
of Antwerp, &s;on of a painter who had long re&s;ided in England, but
who had &s;ettled and died at Roan. The &s;on came over young, and
&s;tudied under Tillemans, and afterwards copied Watteau and Paulo
Panini. He painted land&s;cape, figures, and conver&s;ations, and par|ticularly
<PB N="56" REF="78">
the amu&s;ements of children. He was much employed by
lord Cobham at Stowe, and by the late earl of Tilney. He died in
St. Anne's pari&s;h, January 21, 1748, aged forty-two, and left a
wife and a numerous young family. Slater painted in the &s;ame kind
with Nollikins, and executed cielings and works in fre&s;co at Stowe
and at the earl of We&s;tmorland's at Mereworth in Kent.
<Q>&mdash;ROBINSON,</Q>
a young painter from Bath, had been educated under Vandrebank,
but marrying a wife with 4 or <HI>5000l.</HI> and taking the hou&s;e in Cleve|land-court
in which Jervas had lived, he &s;uddenly came into great
bu&s;ine&s;s, though his colouring was faint and feeble. He affected to
dre&s;s all his pictures in Vandyck's habits; a fanta&s;tic fa&s;hion with
which the age was plea&s;ed in other painters too, and which, could
they be taken for the works of that great man, would only &s;erve to
perplex po&s;terity. Vanaken a&s;&s;i&s;ted to give &s;ome credit to the delu|&s;ion.
Robin&s;on died when he was not above thirty, in 1745.
<Q>ANDREA SOLDI,</Q>
of Florence, arrived in 1735, being then about the age of thirty-three.
He had been to vi&s;it the Holy Land, and at Aleppo having
drawn the pictures of &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants, they gave him recom|mendations
to their countrymen. For &s;ome time he had much bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and painted both portraits and hi&s;tory, but outlived his income
and fell into misfortunes.
<PB N="57" REF="79" MS="Y">
<Q>CHEVALIER RUSCA,</Q>
a Milane&s;e, came over in 1738, and painted a few pictures here in
a gawdy fluttering &s;tyle, but with &s;ome merit. I think he &s;taid here
but a very few years.
<Q>STEPHEN SLAUGHTER</Q>
Succeeded Mr. Walton as &s;upervi&s;or of the king's pictures, and had
been for &s;ome time in Ireland, where he painted &s;everal portraits.
He had a &s;i&s;ter that excelled in imitating bronzes and ba&s;reliefs to
the highe&s;t degree of deception. He died at Ken&s;ington, whither he
had retired, May 15, 1765. He was &s;ucceeded in his office of &s;ur|veyor
and keeper of the pictures by Mr. George Knapton, painter in
crayons.
<Q>JAMES WORSDALE</Q>
would have been little known, had he been di&s;tingui&s;hed by no talents
but his pencil. He was apprentice to &s;ir Godfrey Kneller, but mar|rying
his wife's neice without their con&s;ent, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by his ma&s;|ter.
On the reputation however of that education, by his &s;inging,
excellent mimickry and facetious &s;pirit, he gained many patrons and
bu&s;ine&s;s, and was appointed ma&s;ter-painter to the board of ordnance.
He<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Victor's Companion to the Playhou&s;e.</NOTE> publi&s;hed &s;everal &s;mall pieces, &s;ongs, &amp;c. be&s;ides the following
dramatic performances:</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="80">
1. A Cure for a Scold, a ballad opera, taken from Shake&s;peare's
Taming of a Shrew.</P>
<P>2. The A&s;&s;embly, a farce, in which Mr. Wor&s;dale him&s;elf played
the part of lady Pentweezle admirably well.</P>
<P>3. The Queen of Spain.</P>
<P>4. The extravagant Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>He died June 13, 1767, and was buried at St. Paul's Covent-gar|den,
with this epitaph compo&s;ed by him&s;elf,
<Q><L>Eager to get, but not to keep the pelf,</L>
<L>A friend to all mankind, except him&s;elf.</L></Q>
<Q>RANELAGH BARRETT</Q>
was a noted copyi&s;t, who being countenanced by &s;ir Robert Walpole,
copied &s;everal of his collection, and others of the duke of Devon&s;hire
and Dr. Meade. He was indefatigable, and executed a va&s;t number
of works. He &s;ucceeded greatly in copying Rubens. He died in
1768, and his pictures were &s;old by auction in December of that year.
<Q>JOHN WOOTTON,</Q>
a &s;cholar of Wyck, was a very capital ma&s;ter in the branch of his
profe&s;&s;ion to which he principally devoted him&s;elf, and by which he
was peculiarly qualified to plea&s;e in this country; I mean, by paint|ing
hor&s;es and dogs, which he both drew and coloured with con|&s;ummate
&s;kill, fire and truth. He was fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by frequent|ing
Newmarket and drawing race-hor&s;es. The prints from his hunt|ing-pieces
<PB N="59" REF="81">
are well known. He afterwards applied to land&s;cape,
approached towards Ga&s;par Pou&s;&s;in, and &s;ometimes imitated happily
the glow of Claud Lorrain. In his latter pieces the leafage of his
trees, from the failure of his eyes, is hard and too di&s;tinctly marked.
He died in January, 1765, at his hou&s;e in Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare, which
he built, and had painted with much ta&s;te and judgment. His prices
were high; for a &s;ingle hor&s;e he has been paid 40 guineas; and 20,
when &s;maller than life. His collection was &s;old before his death, on
his quitting bu&s;ine&s;s; his drawings and prints January 21, 1761,
and his pictures the 12th and 13th of March following.
<Q>GIACOMO AMICONI,</Q>
a Venetian painter of hi&s;tory, came to England in 1729, when he
was about forty years of age. He had &s;tudied under Bellucci in the
Palatine court, and had been &s;ome years in the elector of Bavaria's
&s;ervice. His manner was a &s;till fainter imitation of that nervele&s;s
ma&s;ter Seba&s;tian Ricci, and as void of the glow of life as the Nea|politan
Solimeni: &s;o little attention do the modern Venetian painters
pay to Titian, Tintoret, and Paul Verone&s;e, even in Venice. Ami|coni's
women are meer chalk, as if he had only painted from ladies
who paint them&s;elves. Nor was this his wor&s;e defect; his figures are
&s;o entirely without expre&s;&s;ion, that his hi&s;torical compo&s;itions &s;eem
to repre&s;ent a &s;et of actors in a tragedy, ranged in attitudes again&s;t
the curtain draws up. His Marc Antonys are as free from pa&s;&s;ion
as his Scipios. Yet novelty was propitious to Amiconi, and for a
few years he had great bu&s;ine&s;s. He was employed to paint a &s;tair|ca&s;e
at lord Tankerville's in St. James's-&s;quare [now de&s;troyed.] It
<PB N="60" REF="82">
repre&s;ented &s;tories of Achilles, Telemachus and Tire&s;ias. When he
was to be paid, he produced bills of workmen for &s;caffolding, &amp;c.
amounting to ninety pounds, and a&s;ked no more; content, he &s;aid,
with the opportunity of &s;howing what he could do. The peer gave
him <HI>200l.</HI> more. Amiconi then was employed on the &s;tairca&s;e at
Powis-hou&s;e in Great Ormond-&s;treet, which he decorated with the
&s;tory of Holofernes, but with the additional fault of be&s;towing Roman
dre&s;&s;es on the per&s;onages. His next work was a picture of Shake|&s;peare
and the mu&s;es over the orche&s;tra of the new theatre in Covent-garden.
But as portraiture is the one thing nece&s;&s;ary to a painter in
this country, he was obliged to betake him&s;elf to that employment,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For a whole length he was paid &s;ixty guineas.</NOTE>
much again&s;t his inclination; yet the Engli&s;h never perhaps were
le&s;s in the wrong in in&s;i&s;ting that a painter of hi&s;tory &s;hould turn
limner; the barrenne&s;s of Amiconi's imagination being more &s;uited
to the inactive tamene&s;s of a portrait than to groupes and expre&s;&s;ion.
The duke of Lorrain, afterwards emperor, was then at London and
&s;at to him. He drew the queen and the three elde&s;t prince&s;&s;es, and
prints were taken from his pictures, which he generally endeavoured
to emblematicize by genii and Cupids. In 1736 he made a journey
to Paris with the celebrated &s;inger Farinelli and returned with him
in the October following. His portrait of Farinelli was engraved.
He then engaged with Wagner, an engraver, in a &s;cheme of
prints from Canalletti's views of Venice, and having married an
Italian &s;inger, returned to his own country in 1739, having acquired
here about <HI>5000l.</HI> At la&s;t he &s;ettled in Spain, was appointed painter
to the king, and died at Madrid, September 1752. Brunetti, an
<PB N="61" REF="83">
Italian, who had arrived before Amiconi, and was a painter of ar|chitecture
and ornaments, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the latter at lord Tankerville's and
other places, and painted &s;cenes for the opera. He etched &s;ome
plates of grote&s;que ornaments, but left England for want of bu&s;ine&s;s.
<Q>JAMES SEYMOUR,</Q>
was thought even &s;uperior to Wootton in drawing a hor&s;e, but was
too idle to apply him&s;elf to his profe&s;&s;ion, and never attained any
higher excellence. He was the only &s;on of Mr. James Seymour, a
banker and great virtuo&s;o, who drew well him&s;elf and had been in|timate
with Faithorne, Lely, Simon, and &s;ir Chri&s;topher Wren, and
died at the age of eighty-one, in 1739: the &s;on in 1752, aged fifty.
<Q>JOHN BAPTIST VANLOO,</Q>
brother of Carlo Vanloo, a painter in great e&s;teem at Paris, &s;tudied
in the academy at Rome, and became painter to the king of Sar|dinia,
in who&s;e court he made a con&s;iderable fortune, but lo&s;t it all
in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, going to Paris in the year of that bubble. He was
countenanced by the regent, and appointed one of the king's painters,
though inferior in merit to his brother. At Paris he had the honour
of drawing the portrait of king Stani&s;las. In 1737 he came to Eng|land
with his &s;on, when he was about the age of fifty-five. His fir&s;t
works here were the portraits of Colley Cibber and Owen Mac Swin|ney,
who&s;e long &s;ilver-grey hairs were extremely picture&s;que and
contributed to give the new painter reputation. Mac Swinney was
a remarkable per&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See more of him in Cibber's apology for his own life.</NOTE>, of much humour, and had been formerly a
<PB N="62" REF="84">
manager of the operas, but for &s;everal years had re&s;ided at Venice.
He had been concerned in a publication of prints from Vandyck,
ten whole lengths of which were engraved by Van Gun&s;t. He after|wards
engaged in procuring a &s;et of emblematic pictures, exhibiting
the mo&s;t &s;hining actions of Engli&s;h heroes, &s;tate&s;men, and patriots.
The&s;e were painted by the be&s;t ma&s;ters then in Italy, and pompous
prints made from them; but with indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;tories
being &s;o ill told, that it is extremely difficult to decypher to what
individual &s;o many tombs, edifices and allegories belong in each re|&s;pective
piece. Several of the&s;e paintings are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
grace the duke of Richmond.</P>
<P>Vanloo &s;oon bore away the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of London from every
other painter. His likene&s;&s;es were very &s;trong, but not favourable,
and his heads coloured with force. He executed very little of the
re&s;t of his pictures, the draperies of which were &s;upplied by Vana|ken,
and Vanloo's own di&s;ciples Eccardt and Root. However, Van|loo
certainly introduced a better &s;tyle; his pictures were thoroughly
fini&s;hed, natural, and no part neglected. He was laborious, and
demanded five &s;ittings from each per&s;on. But he &s;oon left the palm
to be again contended for by his rivals. He laboured under a com|plication
of di&s;tempers, and being advi&s;ed to try the air of his own
country, Provence, he retired thither in October 1742, and died
there in April 1746.
<Q>JOSEPH VANAKEN.</Q>
As in England almo&s;t every body's picture is painted, &s;o almo&s;t
every painter's works were painted by Vanaken. He was born at
<PB N="63" REF="85">
Antwerp, and excelling in &s;attins, velvets, lace, embroidery, &amp;c.
he was employed by &s;everal con&s;iderable painters here to draw the
attitudes and dre&s;s the figures in their pictures; which makes it very
difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the works of the &s;everal performers. Hogarth
drew the &s;uppo&s;ed funeral of Vanaken, attended by the painters he
worked for, di&s;covering every mark of grief and de&s;pair. He died
of a fever July 4, 1749, aged about fifty. He left a brother, who
followed the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>There was another of the &s;ame &s;irname, Arnold Vanaken, who
painted &s;mall figures, land&s;capes, conver&s;ations, and publi&s;hed a &s;et
of prints of fi&s;hes, or the wonders of the deep. Arnold had a brother
who painted in the &s;ame way, and &s;craped mezzotintos.
<Q>CLERMONT,</Q>
a Frenchman, was many years in England, painted in grote&s;que,
foliages with birds and monkies, and executed &s;everal cielings and
ornaments of buildings in gardens; particularly a gallery for Fre|deric
prince of Wales, at Kew; two temples in the duke of Marl|borough's
i&s;land near Wind&s;or, called from his grote&s;ques, Monkey-i&s;land;
the cieling of lord Radnor's gallery, and of my Gothic library,
at Twickenham; the &s;ides of lord Strafford's eating-room in St.
James's-&s;quare, from Raphael's loggie in the Vatican; and a cieling
for lord Northumberland at Sion. Clermont returned to his own
country in 1754.
<PB N="64" REF="86" MS="Y">
<Q>CANALLETTI,</Q>
the well-known painter of views of Venice, came to England in
1746, when he was about the age of fifty, by per&s;ua&s;ion of his coun|tryman
Amiconi, and encouraged by the multitudes of pictures he
had &s;old to or &s;ent over to the Engli&s;h. He was then in good cir|cum&s;tances,
and it was &s;aid came to ve&s;t his money in our &s;tocks.
I think he did not &s;tay here above two years. I have a per&s;pective
by him of the in&s;ide of King's-college chapel.
<Q>&mdash;JOLI,</Q>
I think a Venetian, was in England in this reign, and painted ruins
with hi&s;toric figures, in the manner of Paolo Panini. At Joli's
hou&s;e I &s;aw one of tho&s;e pictures, in which were a&s;&s;embled as many
blunders and improprieties as could be well contained in that com|pa&s;s.
The &s;ubject was Alexander adorning the tomb of Achilles&mdash;
on a grave-&s;tone was in&s;cribed, Hic Jacet M. Achille, P. P.
<HI>i. e.</HI> pater patriae. The Chri&s;tian Latin, the Roman M. for Marcus,
the Pater Patriae, and the Italian termination to Achilles, all this
confu&s;ion of ignorance, made the picture a real curio&s;ity.
<Q>GEORGE LAMBERT.</Q>
In a country &s;o profu&s;ely beautified with the amaenities of nature, it
is extraordinary that we have produced &s;o few good painters of land|&s;cape.

precipices and ca&s;tellated mountains, becau&s;e Virgil ga&s;ped for breath
at Naples, and Salvator wandered amid&s;t Alps and Apennines.
Our ever verdant lawns, rich vales, fields of haycocks, and hop|grounds,
are neglected as homely and familiar objects. The latter,
which I never &s;aw painted, are very picture&s;que, particularly in the
&s;ea&s;on of gathering, when &s;ome tendrils are ambitiou&s;ly climbing,
and others dangling in natural fe&s;toons; while poles, de&s;poiled of
their garlands, are erected into ea&s;y pyramids that contra&s;t with the
taper and upright columns. In Kent &s;uch &s;cenes are often backed
by &s;and-hills that enliven the green, and the gatherers di&s;per&s;ed
among the narrow alleys enliven the picture, and give it various
di&s;tances.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is a print by Smith of one John Lambert, E&s;&abque; painting an hi&s;toric piece, from a portrait done by him&s;elf: I do not know whether he was related to George Lambert.</NOTE> Lambert, who was in&s;tructed by Ha&s;&s;el and at fir&s;t imitated
Wootton, was a very good ma&s;ter in the Italian &s;tyle, and followed
the manner of Ga&s;par, but with more richne&s;s in his compo&s;itions.
His trees were in a great ta&s;te, and grouped nobly. He painted
many admirable &s;cenes for the playhou&s;e, where he had room to
di&s;play his genius; and, in concert with Scott, executed &s;ix large
pictures of their &s;ettlements for the Ea&s;t-India company, which are
placed at their hou&s;e in Leadenhall-&s;treet. He died Feb. 1, 1765.
He did a few land&s;capes in crayons.

<Q>THOMAS WORLIDGE</Q>
for the greater part of his life painted portraits in miniature: he af|terwards
with wor&s;e &s;ucce&s;s performed them in oil; but at la&s;t ac|quired
reputation and money by etchings in the manner of Rem|brandt,
proved to be a very ea&s;y ta&s;k by the numbers of men who
have counterfeited that ma&s;ter &s;o as to deceive all tho&s;e who did not
know his works by heart. Worlidge's imitations and his heads in
black-lead have grown a&s;toni&s;hingly into fa&s;hion. His be&s;t piece is the
whole length of &s;ir John A&s;tley, copied from Rembrandt: his print
of the theatre at Oxford and the act there, and his &s;tatue of lady Pom|fret's
Cicero, are very poor performances. His la&s;t work was a book
of gems from the antique. He died Sept. 23, 1766, at Hammer|&s;mith,

it&s;elf with dignity by the &s;ide of painting, and actually maintains a
rank among the works of genius. Mi&s;s Gray was the fir&s;t who di&s;|tingui&s;hed
her&s;elf by &s;o bold an emulation of painting. She was
taught by a Mr. Taylor, but greatly excelled him, as appears by
their works at lord Spencer's at Wimbledon. His repre&s;ents an old
woman &s;elling fruit to a Flemi&s;h woman, after Snyder: hers a very
large picture of three recruiting-officers and a pea&s;ant, whole lengths&mdash;in

This gentlewoman has been followed by a very great mi&s;tre&s;s of the
art, Caroline counte&s;s of Aile&s;bury, who has not only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed &s;eve|ral
good pictures that &s;he has copied, but works with &s;uch rapidity

works, &s;he has done a picture of fowls, a water-dog and a heron,
from Oudry, and an old woman &s;pinning, whole length, from Ve|la&s;co,

<Q>WILLIAM HOGARTH.</Q>
<P>HAVING di&s;patched the herd of our painters in oil, I re&s;erved
to a cla&s;s by him&s;elf that great and original genius, Hogarth;
con&s;idering him rather as a writer of comedy with a pencil, than as
a painter. If catching the manners and follies of an age <HI>living as
they ri&s;e,</HI> if general &s;atire on vices and ridicules, familiarized by
&s;trokes of nature, and heightened by wit, and the whole animated
by proper and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;ions, be comedy, Hogarth
compo&s;ed comedies as much as Moliere: in his marriage alamode
there is even an intrigue carried on throughout the piece. He is
more true to character than Congreve; each per&s;onage is di&s;tinct
from the re&s;t, acts in his &s;phere, and cannot be confounded with
any other of the dramatis per&s;onae. The alderman's footboy, in the
la&s;t print of the &s;et I have mentioned, is an ignorant ru&s;tic; and if
wit is &s;truck out from the characters in which it is not expected, it is
from their acting conformably to their &s;ituation and from the mode
<PB REF="93">
<FIGURE>
<P>WILLIAM HOGARTH.</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="69" REF="94">
of their pa&s;&s;ions, not from their having the wit of fine gentlemen.
Thus there is wit in the figure of the alderman, who when his
daughter is expiring in the agonies of poi&s;on, wears a face of &s;olli|citude,
but it is to &s;ave her gold ring, which he is drawing gently
from her finger. The thought is parallel to Moliere's, where the
mi&s;er puts out one of the candles as he is talking. Moliere, inimita|ble
as he has proved, brought a rude theatre to perfection. Hogarth
had no model to follow and improve upon. He created his art;
and u&s;ed colours in&s;tead of language. His place is between the Ita|lians,
whom we may con&s;ider as epic poets and tragedians, and the
Flemi&s;h painters, who are as writers of farce and editors of bur|le&s;que
nature.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When they attempt humour, it is by making a drunkard vomit; they take evacuations for jokes, and when they make us &s;ick, think they make us laugh. A boor hugging a frightful frow is a frequent incident even in the works of Teniers. If there were painters in the Alps, I &s;uppo&s;e they would exhibit Mars and Venus with a conjunction of &s;welled throats. I cannot deny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving that we actually po&s;&s;e&s;s a painter, who fini&s;hing as ex|qui&s;itely as the Flemi&s;h, is a true ma&s;ter of comic nature. Need I &s;ay his name is Zaffanii?</NOTE> They are the Tom Browns of the mob. Hogarth
re&s;embles Butler, but his &s;ubjects are more univer&s;al, and amid&s;t all
his plea&s;antry, he ob&s;erves the true end of comedy, reformation;
there is always a moral to his pictures. Sometimes he ro&s;e to tra|gedy,
not in the cata&s;trophe of kings and heroes, but in marking
how vice conducts in&s;en&s;ibly and incidentally to mi&s;ery and &s;hame.
He warns again&s;t encouraging cruelty and idlene&s;s in young minds,
and di&s;cerns how the different vices of the great and the vulgar lead
<PB N="70" REF="95">
by various paths to the &s;ame unhappine&s;s. The fine lady in Mar|riage
Alamode, and Tom Nero in the Four Stages of Cruelty, termi|nate
their &s;tory in blood&mdash;&s;he occa&s;ions the murder of her hu&s;band,
he a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates his mi&s;tre&s;s. How delicate and &s;uperior too is his &s;atire,
when he intimates in the College of Phy&s;icians and Surgeons that pre|&s;ide
at a di&s;&s;ection, how the legal habitude of viewing &s;hocking
&s;cenes hardens the human mind, and renders it unfeeling. The pre|&s;ident
maintains the dignity of in&s;en&s;ibility over an executed corp&s;e,
and con&s;iders it but as the object of a lecture. In the print of the
Sleeping Judges, this habitual indifference only excites our laughter.</P>
<P>It is to Hogarth's honour that in &s;o many &s;cenes of &s;atire or ridi|cule,
it is obvious that ill-nature did not guide his pencil. His end
is always reformation, and his reproofs general. Except in the print
of the Times, and the two portraits of Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Churchill
that followed, no man amid&s;t &s;uch a profu&s;ion of characteri&s;tic faces,
ever pretended to di&s;cover or charge him with the caricatura of a
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">If he indulged his &s;pirit of ridicule in per&s;onalities, it never proceeded be|yond &s;ketches and drawings; his prints touched the folly, but &s;pared the per&s;on. Early he drew a noted mi&s;er, one of the &s;heriffs, trying a ma&s;tiff that had robbed his kitchen, but the magi&s;trate's &s;on went to his hou&s;e and cut the picture to pieces.</NOTE> real per&s;on; except of &s;uch notorious characters as Chartres and
mother Needham, and a very few more, who are acting officially and
&s;uitably to their profe&s;&s;ions. As he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved &s;o carefully
the operation of the pa&s;&s;ions on the countenance, it is even wonder|ful
that he never, though without intention, delivered the very fea|tures
of any identical per&s;on. It is at the &s;ame time a proof of his
<PB N="71" REF="96">
intimate intuition into nature: but had he been too &s;evere, the hu|manity
of endeavouring to root out cruelty to animals would atone
for many &s;atires. It is another proof that he drew all his &s;tores from
nature and the force of his own genius, and was indebted neither to
models nor books for his &s;tyle, thoughts or hints, that he never &s;uc|ceeded
when he de&s;igned for the works of other men. I do not
&s;peak of his early performances at the time that he was engaged by
book&s;ellers, and ro&s;e not above tho&s;e they generally employ; but in
his maturer age, when he had invented his art, and gave a few de|&s;igns
for &s;ome great authors, as Cervantes, Gulliver, and even Hu|dibras,
his compo&s;itions were tame, &s;piritle&s;s, void of humour, and
never reach the merits of the books they were de&s;igned to illu&s;trate.
He could not bend his talents to think after any body el&s;e. He could
think like a great genius rather than after one. I have a &s;ketch in
oil that he gave me, which he intended to engrave. It was done at
the time that the Hou&s;e of Commons appointed a committee to en|quire
into the cruelties exerci&s;ed on pri&s;oners in the Fleet to extort
money from them. The &s;cene is the committee; on the table are
the in&s;truments of torture. A pri&s;oner in rags half &s;tarved appears
before them; the poor man has a good countenance that adds to the
intere&s;t. On the other hand is the inhuman goaler. It is the very
figure that Salvator Ro&s;a would have drawn for Iago in the moment
of detection. Villany, fear, and con&s;cience are mixed in yellow
and livid on his countenance, his lips are contracted by tremor, his
face advances as eager to lie, his legs &s;tep back as thinking to make
his e&s;cape; one hand is thru&s;t precipitately into his bo&s;om, the fin|gers
of the other are catching uncertainly at his button-holes. If this
<PB N="72" REF="97">
was a portrait, it is the mo&s;t &s;peaking that ever was drawn; if it
was not, it is &s;till finer.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom that his figures do not expre&s;s the character he intend|ed
to give them. When they wanted an illu&s;tration that colours
could not be&s;tow, collateral circum&s;tances, full of wit, &s;upply notes.
The nobleman in Marriage Alamode has a great air&mdash;the coronet on
his crutches, and his pedigree i&s;&s;uing out of the bowels of William
the Conqueror, add his character. In the breakfa&s;t the old &s;teward
reflects for the &s;pectator. Sometimes a &s;hort label is an epigram,
and is never introduced without improving the &s;ubject. Unfortu|nately
&s;ome circum&s;tances, that were temporary, will be lo&s;t to po&s;te|rity,
the fate of all comic authors; and if ever an author wanted a
commentary that none of his beauties might be lo&s;t, it is Hogarth&mdash;not
from being ob&s;cure, [for he never was that but in two or three
of his fir&s;t prints where tran&s;ient national follies, as lotteries, free|ma&s;onry,
and the South-&s;ea were his topics] but for the u&s;e of fo|reigners,
and from a multiplicity of little incidents, not e&s;&s;ential to,
but always heightening the principal action. Such is the &s;pider's-web
extended over the poor's box in a pari&s;h-church; the blunders
in architecture in the nobleman's &s;eat &s;een through the window, in
the fir&s;t print of Marriage Alamode; and a thou&s;and in the Strollers
dre&s;&s;ing in a Barn, which for wit and imagination, without any other
end, I think the be&s;t of all his works: as for u&s;eful and deep &s;atire,
that on the Methodi&s;ts is the mo&s;t &s;ublime. The &s;cenes of Bedlam
and the gaming-hou&s;e, are inimitable repre&s;entations of our &s;erious
follies or unavoidable woes; and the concern &s;hown by the lord-mayor
when the companion of his childhood is brought before him
<PB N="73" REF="98">
as a criminal, is a touching picture, and big with humane admoni|tion
and reflection.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this author's genius is his not conde&s;cending
to explain his moral le&s;&s;ons by the trite poverty of allegory. If he
had an emblematic thought, he expre&s;&s;ed it with wit, rather than by
a &s;ymbol. Such is that of the whore's &s;etting fire to the world in the
Rake's Progre&s;s. Once indeed he de&s;cended to u&s;e an allegoric per|&s;onage,
and was not happy in it: in one of his election prints Bri|tannia's
chariot breaks down, while the coachman and footman are
playing at cards on the box. Sometimes too, to plea&s;e his vulgar
cu&s;tomers, he &s;tooped to low images and national &s;atire, as in the
two prints of France and England, and that of the Gates of Calais.
The la&s;t indeed has great merit, though the caricatura is carried
to exce&s;s. In all the&s;e the painter's purpo&s;e was to make his
countrymen ob&s;erve the ea&s;e and affluence of a free government, op|po&s;ed
to the wants and woes of &s;laves. In Beer-&s;treet the Engli&s;h
butcher to&s;&s;ing a Frenchman in the air with one hand, is ab&s;olute
hyperbole; and what is wor&s;e, was an afterthought, not being in
the fir&s;t edition. The Gin-alley is much &s;uperior, horridly fine, but
di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>His Bartholomew-fair is full of humour; the March to Finchley,
of nature: the Enraged Mu&s;ician tends to farce. The Four Parts of
the Day, except the la&s;t, are inferior to few of his works. The
Sleeping Congregation, the Lecture on the Vacuum, the Laughing
Audience, the Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;icians as a coat of arms, and the
Cockpit, are perfect in their &s;everal kinds. The prints of Indu&s;try
and Idlene&s;s have more merit in the intention than execution.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="99">
Towards his latter end he now and then repeated him&s;elf, but
&s;eldomer than mo&s;t great authors who executed &s;o much.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;ingular that of an author whom I call comic, and
who is &s;o celebrated for his humour, I &s;hould &s;peak in general in &s;o
&s;erious a &s;tyle; but it would be &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the merits of his heart
to con&s;ider him only as a promoter of laughter. I think I have
&s;hown that his views were more generous and exten&s;ive. Mirth co|loured
his pictures, but benevolence de&s;igned them. He &s;miled like
Socrates, that men might not be offended at his lectures, and might
learn to laugh at their own follies. When his topics were harmle&s;s,
all his touches were marked with plea&s;antry, and fun. He never
laughed like Rabelais at non&s;en&s;e that he impo&s;ed for wit; but like
Swift combined incidents that divert one from their unexpected en|counter,
and illu&s;trate the tale he means to tell. Such are the hens
roo&s;ting on the upright waves in the &s;cene of the Strollers, and the
devils drinking porter on the altar. The manners or <HI>co&s;tume</HI> are
more than ob&s;erved in every one of his works. The very furniture
of his rooms de&s;cribe the characters of the per&s;ons to whom they
belong; a le&s;&s;on that might be of u&s;e to comic authors. It was re|&s;erved
to Hogarth to write a &s;cene of furniture. The rake's levee-room,
the nobleman's dining-room, the apartments of the hu&s;band
and wife in Marriage Alamode, the alderman's parlour, the poet's
bechamber, and many others, are the hi&s;tory of the manners of
the age.</P>
<P>But perhaps too much has been &s;aid of this great genius as an
author, it is time to &s;peak of him as a painter, and to mention the
circum&s;tances of his life, in both which I &s;hall be more brief. His
works are his hi&s;tory; as a painter, he had but &s;lender merit.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="100">
He was born in the pari&s;h of St. Bartholomew, London, the &s;on
of a low trade&s;man, who bound him to a mean engraver of arms on
plate; but before his time was expired he felt the impul&s;e of genius,
and felt it directed him to painting, though little apprized at that
time of the mode nature had intended he &s;hould pur&s;ue. His ap|prentice&s;hip
was no &s;ooner expired, than he entered into the academy
in St. Martin's-lane, and &s;tudied drawing from the life, in which
he never attained to great excellence. It was character, the pa&s;&s;ions,
the &s;oul, that his genius was given him to copy. In colouring he
proved no greater a ma&s;ter: his force lay in expre&s;&s;ion, not in tints
and chiaro &s;curo. At fir&s;t he worked for book&s;ellers, and de&s;igned
and engraved plates for &s;everal books; and, which is extraordinary,
no &s;ymptom of genius dawned in tho&s;e plates. His Hudibras was
the fir&s;t of his works that marked him as a man above the common;
yet what made him then noticed, now &s;urprizes us to find &s;o little
humour in an undertaking &s;o congenial to his talents. On the &s;uc|ce&s;s
however of tho&s;e plates he commenced painter, a painter of por|traits;
the mo&s;t ill-&s;uited employment imaginable to a man who&s;e
turn certainly was not flattery, nor his talent adapted to look on
vanity without a &s;neer. Yet his facility in catching a likene&s;s, and
the method he cho&s;e of painting families and conver&s;ations in &s;mall,
then a novelty, drew him prodigious bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome time. It did
not la&s;t, either from his applying to the real bent of his di&s;po&s;ition,
or from his cu&s;tomers apprehending that a &s;atiri&s;t was too formidable
a confe&s;&s;or for the devote&egrave;s of &s;elf-love. He had already dropped a
few of his &s;maller prints on &s;ome reigning follies, but as the dates
are wanting on mo&s;t of them, I cannot a&s;certain which, though tho&s;e
on the South-&s;ea and Rabbit-woman prove that he had early di&s;co|vered
<PB N="76" REF="101">
his talent for ridicule, though he did not then think of build|ing
his reputation or fortune on its powers.</P>
<P>His Midnight Modern Conver&s;ation was the fir&s;t work that &s;howed
his command of character: but it was the Harlot's Progre&s;s, pub|li&s;hed
in 1729 or 1730 that e&s;tabli&s;hed his fame. The pictures were
&s;carce fini&s;hed and no &s;ooner exhibited to the public, and the &s;ub|&s;cription
opened, than above twelve hundred names were entered on
his book. The familiarity of the &s;ubject, and the propriety of the
execution, made it ta&s;ted by all ranks of people. Every engraver
&s;et him&s;elf to copy it, and thou&s;ands of imitations were di&s;per&s;ed all
over the kingdom. It was made into a pantomime, and performed
on the &s;tage. The Rake's Progre&s;s, perhaps &s;uperior, had not &s;o
much &s;ucce$s, from want of novelty; nor indeed is the print of the
arre&s;t equal in merit to the others.</P>
<P>The curtain was now drawn a&s;ide, and his genius &s;tood di&s;played in
its full lu&s;tre. From time to time he continued to give tho&s;e works that
&s;hould be immortal, if the nature of his art will allow it. Even the
receipts for his &s;ub&s;criptions had wit in them. Many of his plates he
engraved him&s;elf, and often expunged faces etched by his a&s;&s;i&s;tants
when they had not done ju&s;tice to his ideas.</P>
<P>Not content with &s;hining in a path untrodden before, he was am|bitious
of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf as a painter of hi&s;tory. But not
only his colouring and drawing rendered him unequal to the ta&s;k;
the genius that had entered &s;o feelingly into the calamities and crimes
of familiar life, de&s;erted him in a walk that called for dignity and
grace. The burle&s;que turn of his mind mixed it&s;elf with the mo&s;t
&s;erious &s;ubjects. In his Danae the old nur&s;e tries a coin of the
golden &s;hower with her teeth, to &s;ee if it is true gold: the Pool of
<PB N="77" REF="102">
Bethe&s;da a &s;ervant of a rich ulcerated lady beats back a poor man
that &s;ought the &s;ame cele&s;tial remedy. Both circum&s;tances are ju&s;tly
thought, but rather too ludicrous. It is a much more capital fault
that Danae her&s;elf is a meer nymph of Drury. He &s;eems to have
conceived no higher idea of beauty.</P>
<P>So little had he eyes to his own deficiencies, that he believed he
had di&s;covered the principle of grace. With the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a
di&s;coverer he cried, Eureka! This was his famous line of beauty,
the ground-work of his Analy&s;is, a book that has many &s;en&s;ible hints
and ob&s;ervations, but that did not carry the conviction nor meet the
univer&s;al acquie&s;cence he expected. As he treated his contemporaries
with &s;corn, they triumphed over this publication, and imitated him
to expo&s;e him. Many wretched burle&s;que prints came out to ridicule
his &s;y&s;tem. There was a better an&s;wer to it in one of the two prints
that he gave to illu&s;trate his hypothe&s;is. In the ball had he confined
him&s;elf to &s;uch outlines as compo&s;e awkwardne&s;s and deformity, he
would have proved half his a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;but he has added two &s;amples
of grace in a young lord and lady, that are &s;trikingly &s;tiff and affect|ed.
They are a Bath beau and a country beauty.</P>
<P>But this was the failing of a vi&s;ionary. He fell afterwards into a
gro&s;&s;er mi&s;take. From a contempt of the ignorant virtuo&s;i of the
age, and from indignation at the impudent tricks of picture-dealers,
whom he &s;aw continually recommending and vending vile copies to
bubble-collectors, and from having never &s;tudied, indeed having
&s;een, few good pictures of the great Italian ma&s;ters, he per&s;uaded
him&s;elf that the prai&s;es be&s;towed on tho&s;e glorious works were no|thing
but the effects of prejudice. He talked this language till he
believed it; and having heard it often a&s;&s;erted, as is true, that time
<PB N="78" REF="103">
gives a mellowne&s;s to colours and improves them, he not only de|nied
the propo&s;ition, but maintained that pictures only grew black
and wor&s;e by age, not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the degrees in which
the propo&s;ition might be true or fal&s;e. He went farther: he deter|mined
to rival the ancients&mdash;and unfortunately cho&s;e one of the fine&s;t
pictures in England as the object of his competition. This was the
celebrated Sigi&s;monda of &s;ir Luke Schaub, now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the duke of Newca&s;tle, &s;aid to be painted by Correggio, probably
by Furino, but no matter by whom. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the pic|ture
or read Dryden's inimitable tale, and not feel that the &s;ame &s;oul
animated both. After many e&s;&s;ays Hogarth at la&s;t produced <HI>his</HI>
Sigi&s;monda&mdash;but no more like Sigi&s;monda, than I to Hercules. Not
to mention the wretchedne&s;s of the colouring, it was the repre&s;enta|tion
of a maudlin &s;trumpet ju&s;t turned out of keeping, and with eyes
red with rage and u&s;quebaugh, tearing off the ornaments her keeper
had given her. To add to the di&s;gu&s;t rai&s;ed by &s;uch vulgar expre&s;|&s;ion,
her fingers were bloodied by her lover's heart that lay before
her like that of a &s;heep's for her dinner. None of the &s;ober grief,
no dignity of &s;uppre&s;&s;ed angui&s;h, no involuntary tear, no &s;ettled
meditation on the fate &s;he meant to meet, no amorous warmth
turned holy by de&s;pair; in &s;hort all was wanting that &s;hould have
been there, all was there that &s;uch a &s;tory would have bani&s;hed from
a mind capable of conceiving &s;uch complicated woe; woe &s;o &s;ternly
felt and yet &s;o tenderly. Hogarth's performance was more ridicu|lous
than any thing he had ever ridiculed. He &s;et the price of <HI>400l.</HI>
on it, and had it returned on his hands by the per&s;on for whom it
was painted. He took &s;ub&s;criptions for a plate of it, but had the
<PB N="79" REF="104">
&s;en&s;e at la&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s it. I make no more apology for this account
than for the encomiums I have be&s;towed on him. Both are dictated
by truth, and are the hi&s;tory of a great man's excellencies and errors.
Milton, it is &s;aid, preferred his Paradi&s;e Regained to his immortal
poem.</P>
<P>The la&s;t memorable event of our arti&s;t's life was his quarrel with
Mr. Wilkes, in which if Mr. Hogarth did not commence direct
ho&s;tilities on the latter, he at lea&s;t obliquely gave the fir&s;t offence by
an attack on the friends and party of that gentleman. This conduct
was the more &s;urprizing, as he had all his life avoided dipping his
pencil in political conte&s;ts, and had early refu&s;ed a very lucrative
offer that was made to engage him in a &s;et of prints again&s;t the head
of a court-party. Without entering into the merits of the cau&s;e, I
&s;hall only &s;tate the fact. In September 1762, Mr. Hogarth pub|li&s;hed
his print of the Times. It was an&s;wered by Mr. Wilkes in a
&s;evere North-Briton. On this the painter exhibited the caricatura of
the writer. Mr. Churchill, the poet, then engaged in the war, and
wrote his epi&s;tle to Hogarth, not the brighte&s;t of his works, and in
which the &s;evere&s;t &s;trokes fell on a defect that the painter had neither
cau&s;ed nor could amend&mdash;his age; and which however was neither
remarkable nor decrepit; much le&s;s had it impaired his talents, as
appeared by his having compo&s;ed but &s;ix months before one of his
mo&s;t capital works, the &s;atire on the Methodi&s;ts. In revenge for
this epi&s;tle, Hogarth caricaturaed Churchill under the form of a
canonical bear, with a club and a pot of porter&mdash;et vitul&acirc; tu dignus
&amp; hic&mdash;never did two angry men of their abilities throw mud with
le&s;s dexterity.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="105">
Mr. Hogarth, in the year 1730, married the only daughter of
&s;ir James Thornhill, by whom he had no children. He died of
a drop&s;y in his brea&s;t, at his hou&s;e in Leice&s;ter-fields, October 26,
1764.</P>
<P>He &s;old about twenty-four of his principal pictures by auction in
1745. Mr. Vincent Bourne addre&s;&s;ed a copy of Latin hendeca&s;ylla|bles
to him on his chief pictures; and Roquetti, the enameller,
publi&s;hed a French explanation, though a &s;uperficial one, of many
of his prints, which, it was &s;aid, he had drawn up for the u&s;e of
mar&s;hal Bellei&s;le, then a pri&s;oner in England.</P>
<P>As I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t compleat collection of his prints
that I believe exi&s;ts, I &s;hall for the u&s;e of collectors give a catalogue
of them. Mo&s;t them were a&s;&s;embled by Mr. Arthur Pond, and
&s;ome of them probably are now no where el&s;e to be found. I have
added every other print that I could di&s;cover to have been de&s;igned
or engraved by him. He had kept no &s;uite him&s;elf, and had for|gotten
&s;everal in which he had been concerned. He gave me what
few &s;ketches had not been forced from him by his friends, particu|larly
the Committee above-mentioned, and the fir&s;t thoughts for In|du&s;try
and Idlene&s;s.</P>

It came out about a fortnight before the genuine &s;et, but was &s;oon forgotten. However this gave occa&s;ion to Hogarth to apply for an act of parliament to &s;ecure the property of prints. He applied to Mr. Huggins, who took for his model the &s;tatute of queen Anne in favour of literary property. The act pa&s;&s;ed; but &s;ome years after appeared to be too loo&s;ely drawn, for on a cau&s;e founded on it, which came be|fore lord Hardwick in chancery, he determined that no a&s;&s;ignee, claiming under an a&s;&s;ignment from the original inventor, could take any benefit by it.

<HEAD>JOHN STEPHEN LIOTARD,</HEAD>
<P>OF Geneva,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was born in 1702, and was de&s;igned for a merchant. He went to &s;tudy at Paris in 1725, and in 1738 accompanied the marquis de Pui&s;ieux to Rome, who was going amba&s;&s;ador to Naples. At Rome he was taken notice of by the earls of Sandwich and Be&s;borough, then lord Duncannon, who engaged Liotard to go with them on a voyage to Con&s;tantinople. <HI>See Mu&s;eum Florent. vol.</HI> X, where lord Duncannon's name is &s;pelt milord D'un Canon.</NOTE> came over in the la&s;t reign, and &s;tayed two years.
He painted admirably well in miniature, and finely in enamel,
though he &s;eldom practiced it. But he is be&s;t known by his works
in crayons. His likene&s;&s;es were as exact as po&s;&s;ible, and too like to
plea&s;e tho&s;e who &s;at to him; thus he had great bu&s;ine&s;s the fir&s;t year,
and very little the &s;econd. Devoid of imagination, and one would
think of memory, he could render nothing but what he &s;aw before
his eyes. Freckles, marks of the &s;mall-pox, every thing found its
place; not &s;o much from fidelity, as becau&s;e he could not conceive
the ab&s;ence of any thing that appeared to him. Truth prevailed in
all his works, grace in very few or none. Nor was there any ea&s;e in
his outline; but the &s;tiffne&s;s of a bu&s;t in all his portraits. Thence,
though more faithful to a likene&s;s, his heads want air and the &s;oftne&s;s
of fle&s;h, &s;o con&s;picuous in Ro&s;alba's pictures. Her bodies have a dif|ferent

fault; &s;he gave to men an effeminate protuberance about the
brea&s;ts; yet her pictures have much more genius. The earls of Har|rington
and Be&s;borough have &s;ome of his mo&s;t capital works. At
Con&s;tantinople he became acquainted with the late lord Edgcumbe,
and &s;ir Everard Fawkener, our amba&s;&s;ador, who per&s;uaded him to
come to England. On his way he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Paris. In his
journey to the Levant he adopted the ea&s;tern habit, and wore it here
with a very long beard. It contributed much to the portraits of him|&s;elf,
and &s;ome thought to draw cu&s;tomers; but he was really a painter
of uncommon merit. After his return, he married a young<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Maria Fargues, daughter of a merchant at Am&s;terdam</NOTE> wife,
and &s;acrificed his beard to Hymen. He came again to England in
1772, and brought a collection of pictures of different ma&s;ters, which
he &s;old by auction; and &s;ome pieces of gla&s;s painted by him&s;elf with
&s;urpri&s;ing effect of light and &s;hade, but a mere curio&s;ity, as it was
nece&s;&s;ary to darken the room before they could be &s;een to advantage;
he affixed too, as u&s;ual, extravagant prices to them. He &s;taid here
about two years, as in his former journey. He has engraved &s;ome
Turki&s;h portraits, one of the empre&s;s queen and the elde&s;t arch-duch|e&s;s,
in Turki&s;h habits, and the heads of the emperor and empre&s;s.
<Q>FREDERIC ZINCKE</Q>
was born at Dre&s;den about 1684, and came to England in 1706,
where he &s;tudied under Boit, whom at length he not only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed,
but rivalled Petitot. I have a head of Cowley by him after &s;ir Peter
Lely, which is allowed to excel any &s;ingle work of that charming
enameller. The impa&s;&s;ioned glow of &s;entiment, the eyes &s;wimming
with youth and tenderne&s;s, and the natural fall of the long ringlets
<PB N="92" REF="118">
that flow round the unbuttoned collar, are rendered with the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite nature, and fini&s;hed with elaborate care. For a great num|ber
of years Mr. Zincke had as much bu&s;ine&s;s as he could execute;
and when at la&s;t he rai&s;ed his price from twenty to thirty guineas, it
was occa&s;ioned by his de&s;ire of le&s;&s;ening his fatigue, for no man, &s;o
&s;uperior in his profe&s;&s;ion, was le&s;s intoxicated with vanity. He was
particularly patronized by the late king and queen, and was appoint|ed
cabinet-painter to the late prince of Wales. Her royal highne&s;s
prince&s;s Amelie has many portraits of the royal family by him of a
larger than his u&s;ual &s;ize. The late duke of Cumberland bought &s;e|veral
of his be&s;t works, particularly his beautiful copy of Dr. Meade's
queen of Scots by I&s;aac Oliver. He made a &s;hort vi&s;it to his own
country in 1737, and about 1746, his eyes failing, he retired from
bu&s;ine&s;s to South-Lambeth, with a &s;econd wife, by whom he had
three or four children. His fir&s;t wife was a hand&s;ome woman, of
whom he had been very fond; there is a print of him and her: he
had a &s;on by her, for whom he bought a place in the &s;ix clerks office,
and a daughter, who died a little before he retired to Lambeth. Af|ter
his quitting bu&s;ine&s;s, madame Pompadour prevailed upon him to
copy in enamel a picture of the king of France, which &s;he &s;ent over
on purpo&s;e. Mr. Zincke died in March, 1767.
<Q>ROUQUET,</Q>
a Swi&s;s of French extraction, was many years in England, and imi|tated
Mr. Zincke in enamel with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. He afterwards &s;et|tled
at Paris and improved con&s;iderably. He publi&s;hed a &s;mall tract
on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the arts in England. I have mentioned his
explanation of Hogarth's prints.
<PB N="93" REF="119">
<Q>GROTH,</Q>
a German, painted in water-colours and enamel, but made no great
proficience.
<Q>BERNARD LENS,</Q>
of a family of arti&s;ts, whom I have mentioned in the Catalogue of
Engravers, was an admirable painter in miniature. He painted
&s;ome portraits in that way, but his excellence was copying the works
of great ma&s;ters, particularly Rubens and Vandyck, who&s;e colour|ing
he imitated exactly. He was painter to the crown by the title of
enameller, which was changed from limner, when Boit held the
office. Lens publi&s;hed &s;ome views and drawing-books, as he had
many &s;cholars. He made two &s;ales of his pictures, and died at
Knight&s;bridge, whither he had retired from bu&s;ine&s;s about 1741.
He had three &s;ons, two that followed his profe&s;&s;ion, of whom one is
yet living.
<Q>JOSEPH GOUPY</Q>
was another fine painter in water-colours, but in a different &s;tyle from
Lens. The latter &s;tippled the faces, and fini&s;hed highly; Goupy
imitated the boldne&s;s of &s;trokes in oil. The latter too copied many
pictures of Italian ma&s;ters, and excelled in imitating Salvator Ro&s;a,
from who&s;e works he engraved &s;ome prints. He had the honour
of teaching her royal highne&s;s the prince&s;s of Wales. His copies of
the cartoons were &s;old to the duke of Chandos for <HI>300l.</HI> but at the
<PB N="94" REF="120">
duke's &s;ale produced not 17 guineas. If the painter had exacted, the
public had &s;till le&s;s ju&s;tice. Jo&s;eph died the latter end of 1747. He
had an uncle, born in France from whence the family &s;prung, who
came to England, and had already a brother here a fan-painter.
Louis, of whom I &s;peak, painted portraits in oil, and afterwards
worked in fre&s;co and crayons, and taught miniature. He had at|tended
lord Burlington into Italy. There is a print of him by
George White. His nephew Jo&s;eph, and Bernard Lens were two of
our be&s;t miniature-painters, and their works worthy of any cabinet.
<Q>JAMES DEACON,</Q>
a gentleman of great talents for mu&s;ic and drawing, towards the
end of his life engaged profe&s;&s;edly in the bu&s;ine&s;s, took Mr. Zincke's
hou&s;e in Covent-garden, and painted portraits in miniature in a very
ma&s;terly manner; but had &s;carce embarked in the profe&s;&s;ion, when
he lo&s;t his life attending a cau&s;e at the Old Bailey, the day that
the goal-di&s;temper de&s;troyed the judge, the lord-mayor, and &s;o
many of the audience, in May 1750.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">J. MICHAEL RYSBRACH,</HEAD>
<P>The be&s;t &s;culptor that has appeared in the&s;e i&s;lands &s;ince Le Soeur,
was born at Antwerp. His father was a land&s;cape-painter, and had
been in England, but quitted it with Largilliere and went to Paris,
where he married, and returning to Bru&s;&s;els and Antwerp, died at
the latter in 1726, at the age of four&s;core. Michael his &s;on arrived
here in 1720, then about the age of twenty-&s;ix, and began with mo|delling
&s;mall figures in clay, to &s;how his &s;kill. The earl of Notting|ham
&s;at to him for his bu&s;t, in which the arti&s;t &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
that he began to be employed in large works, particularly monu|ments.
For &s;ome time he was engaged by Gibbs, who was &s;en&s;ible
of the young man's merit, but turned it to his own account, con|tracting
for the figures with the per&s;ons who be&s;poke the tombs,
and gaining the chief benefit from the execution. Thus Gibbs re|ceived
<HI>100l.</HI> a piece from lord Oxford for the &s;tatues on Prior's mo|nument,
yet paid Ry&s;brach but <HI>35l.</HI> each. The &s;tatuary, though
no vain man, felt his own merit, and &s;hook off his dependence on
the architect, as he became more known and more admired. Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
crouded upon him, and for many years all great works were
committed to him; and his deep knowledge of his art and &s;ingular
indu&s;try gave general &s;atisfaction. His models were thoroughly
<PB N="96" REF="123">
&s;tudied, and ably executed; and as a &s;culptor capable of furni&s;hing
&s;tatues was now found, our ta&s;te in monuments improved, which
till Ry&s;brach's time had depended more on ma&s;onry and marbles
than &s;tatuary. Gothic tombs owed their chief grandeur to rich cano|pies,
fretwork, and abundance of &s;mall niches and trifling figures.
Bi&s;hops in cumbent attitudes and cro&s;s-legged templars admitted no
grace, nor required any. In the reigns of queen Elizabeth and king
James I. a &s;ingle figure reclining at length on the elbow in robes or
&s;erjeant's gown, was commonly overwhelmed and &s;urrounded with
diminutive pillars and obeli&s;ks of various marbles; and if particu|larly
&s;umptuous, of alaba&s;ter gilt. Gibbs, in the duke of New|ca&s;tle's
monument in the abbey, &s;eems to have had an eye to that
kind of ta&s;tele&s;s expence. From the reign of Charles I. altar-tombs
or mural tablets with cherubims and flaming urns, generally &s;atisfied
the piety of families. Bird indeed be&s;towed bu&s;ts and basreliefs on
tho&s;e he decorated, but &s;ir Cloude&s;ly Shovel's, and other monuments
by him, made men of ta&s;te dread &s;uch honours. Now and then
had appeared a ray of &s;implicity, as in &s;ir Francis Vere's and cap|tain
Hollis's tombs. The abilities of Ry&s;brach taught the age to
depend on &s;tatuary for its be&s;t ornaments, and though he was too
fond of pyramids for back-grounds, his figures are well di&s;po&s;ed,
&s;imple and great. We &s;eem &s;ince to have advanced into &s;cenery.
Mr. Nightingale's tomb, though finely thought and well executed,
is more theatric than &s;epulchral. The crouds and clu&s;ters of tombs
in the abbey has impo&s;ed hard conditions on our &s;culptors, who
have been reduced to couch obeli&s;ks in &s;lanting windows, and rear
ma&s;&s;es into the air, while St. Paul's remains naked of ornaments;
<PB N="97" REF="124">
though it had better remain &s;o, than be &s;ubjected to the indi&s;crimi|nate
expence of all who are willing to indulge their vanity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides numbers more, Ry&s;brach executed the monument of &s;ir
I&s;aac Newton and of the duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, and the
eque&s;trian &s;tatue in bronze of king William at Bri&s;tol in 1733, for
which he received <HI>1800l.</HI> Scheemaker's model, which was rejected,
was however &s;o well de&s;igned, that the city of Bri&s;tol made him a
pre&s;ent of <HI>50l.</HI> for his trouble. Ry&s;brach made al&s;o a great many
bu&s;ts, and mo&s;t of them very like, as of Mr. Pope, Gibbs, &s;ir Ro|bert
Walpole, the duke and duche&s;s of Argyle, the duche&s;s of Marl|borough,
lord Bolingbroke, Wootton, Ben John&s;on, Butler, Milton,
Cromwell, and him&s;elf; the &s;tatues of king George I. and of king
George II. at the Royal-Exchange; the heads in the hermitage at
Richmond, and tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h worthies in the Ely&s;ian-fields
at Stowe.</P>
<P>This enjoyment of de&s;erved fame was at length interrupted by the
appearance of Mr. Scheemaker's Shake&s;peare in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey,
which be&s;ides its merit, had the additional recommendation of Mr.
Kent's fa&s;hionable name. I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething hereafter on the de|fects
of that de&s;ign. It however hurt the vogue of Mr. Ry&s;brach,
who, though certainly not ob&s;cured, found his bu&s;ine&s;s decline, as
it was affected con&s;iderably afterwards by the competition of Mr.
Roubiliac; and no merit can chain the ficklene&s;s of fa&s;hion. Piqued
at Mr. Scheemaker's &s;ucce&s;s, Ry&s;brach produced his three &s;tatues of
Palladio, Inigo Jones, and Fiamingo, and at la&s;t his chef d'oeuvre,
his Hercules; an exqui&s;ite &s;ummary of his &s;kill, knowledge, and
judgment. This athletic &s;tatue, for which he borrowed the head of
<PB N="98" REF="125" MS="Y">
the Farne&s;ian god, was compiled from various parts and limbs of
&s;even or eight of the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t made men in London, chiefly
the brui&s;ers and boxers of the then flouri&s;hing amphitheatre for box|ing,
the &s;culptor &s;electing the parts which were the mo&s;t truly formed
in each. The arms were Broughton's, the brea&s;t a celebrated coach|man's,
a brui&s;er, and the legs were tho&s;e of Ellis the painter, a great
frequenter of that gymna&s;ium. As the games of that Olympic aca|demy
frequently terminated to its heroes at the gallows, it was &s;oon
after &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by act of parliament, &s;o that in reality Ry&s;brach's
Hercules is the monument of tho&s;e gladiators. It was purcha&s;ed by
Mr. Hoare, and is the principal ornament of the noble temple at
Stourhead, that beautiful a&s;&s;emblage of art, ta&s;te, and land&s;capes.</P>
<P>Mr. Ry&s;brach, who had by no means rai&s;ed a fortune equal to
his de&s;erts, before his death made a public &s;ale of his remaining
works and models, to which he added a large collection of his own
hi&s;toric drawings, conceived and executed in the true ta&s;te of the
great Italian ma&s;ters. Another &s;ale followed his death, which hap|pened
January 8, 1770.</P>
<P>He had two brothers, Peter Andreas and G. Ry&s;brachs, who
painted fi&s;h, dead fowls and land&s;cape, with con&s;iderable merit;
particularly the elder, who was born at Paris in 1690, and died here
of a con&s;umption in 1648. In one of Michael's &s;ales were &s;ome
pieces of hi&s;tory by a Louis Ry&s;brach; I do not know whether bro|ther
or nephew of the &s;tatuary, probably the latter; Peter, the eld|e&s;t
of all the brothers, had &s;everal children.</P>
<P>He had a &s;cholar too, named Vander Hagen, who carved heads in
ivory.

<PB N="99" REF="127">
<Q>L. F. ROUBILIAC,</Q>
born at Lyons in France, became a formidable rival to Ry&s;brach,
and latterly was more employed. He had little bu&s;ine&s;s till &s;ir Ed|ward
Walpole recommended him to execute half the bu&s;ts at Tri|nity-college,
Dublin; and by the &s;ame patron's intere&s;t he was em|ployed
on the monument of the general, John duke of Argyle, in
We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, on which the &s;tatue of Eloquence is very ma&s;|terly
and graceful. His &s;tatue of Handel, in the garden at Vaux|hall,
fixed Roubiliac's fame. Two of his principal works are the
monuments of the late duke and duche&s;s of Montagu in Northamp|ton&s;hire,
well performed and magnificent, but wanting &s;implicity.
This able arti&s;t had a turn to poetry, and wrote &s;atires in French ver&s;e.
He died January 11, 1762, and was buried in the pari&s;h of St.
Martin's, where he lived.
<Q>Signor G&Uuml;ELPHI,</Q>
a &s;cholar of Camillo Ru&s;coni, was invited to England by lord Bur|lington,
for whom he did many works in London and at Chi&s;wick.
He was &s;ome time employed in repairing the antiques at lord Pom|fret's
at Ea&s;ton Ne&s;ton, now at Oxford. His tomb of Mr. Craggs
in We&s;tmin&s;ter is graceful and &s;imple, but &s;hows that he was a
very indifferent &s;culptor. After a re&s;idence here of near twenty years
he returned to his native Bologna in 1734.

to England; but &s;ettled at la&s;t at Bru&s;&s;els. There is a good
groupe by him at Stowe. For the late earl of Tilney he made a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">JOHN DASSIER,</HEAD>
<P>Though never in England, is certainly entitled to a place in this
catalogue. He was medalli&s;t to the republic of Geneva, and a&s;pir|ing
to be employed in the mint here, &s;truck a &s;eries of the kings of
England, in a better &s;tyle than our medals had been of late years.
Some of the heads indeed were not taken from true originals, but
the temples and monuments on the rever&s;es were well de&s;igned and
executed. He publi&s;hed them by &s;ub&s;cription in 1731, at &s;ix guineas
for 33 medals in copper, and fifteen in &s;ilver. His brother James
had been here three or four years before to endeavour to procure a
place in our mint for John, but none being vacant, &s;ir Andrew
Fountaine, the celebrated virtuo&s;o and patron of arti&s;ts, and Mr.
Conduit, who had married &s;ir I&s;aac Newton's neice, and who were
the per&s;ons then directing the mint, offered a pen&s;ion of <HI>50l.</HI> a year
to Da&s;&s;ier till Mr. Croker &s;hould die; but he was not content with
the offer. James Antony Da&s;&s;ier, nephew of John, came over, and
on Croker's death in 1740, was next year appointed &s;econd engraver
to the mint, and returned to Geneva in 1745. The uncle had ex|ecuted
a &s;et of the reformers in &s;maller bra&s;s, and begun large me|dals
of &s;ome of our great men then living; the nephew did &s;everal
more, which were &s;old in copper at &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence each,
<PB N="102" REF="131">
and are very good performances, though inferior to the medals of
the popes by Hamerani, and more inferior to tho&s;e of St. Urbain,
medalli&s;t to the la&s;t dukes of Lorrain. There is a beautiful and nu|merous
&s;uite of Roman hi&s;tory in &s;mall medals of bronze by the
younger Da&s;&s;ier.
<Q>J. CHRISTOPHER TANNER,</Q>
of Saxe Gotha, came to England about 1733, and had practiced
carving and graving for &s;nuff-boxes, gun-locks, and in mother of
pearl. He was retained as a dome&s;tic in the family of the prince
of Wales, and by Mr. Conduit employed in the mint, where he
ro&s;e to be principal engraver on the death of Mr. Croker. He did
medals of the prince and prince&s;s of Orange and &s;ir I&s;aac Newton,
and the large family medal of the late king and queen and all their
children.
<Q>LAURENCE NATTIER,</Q>
of Biberach in Suabia, was a good engraver of intaglias and medal|li&s;t.
He &s;truck a fine medal of &s;ir Robert Walpole, the rever&s;e of
which was copied from lord Leice&s;ter's &s;tatue of Cicero. He had
&s;tudied in Italy, and afterwards re&s;ided &s;everal years in England. In
1746 he went to Holland to make a medal of the prince of Orange,
as in 1743 he had been in Denmark with Marcus Tou&s;cher, painter,
architect and engraver, of Nuremberg, who arrived here from Italy
in 1741, and brought a high-fini&s;hed drawing of the great duke's

entrance into Florence, which he al&s;o executed with great labour
for the empre&s;s-queen, who however did not purcha&s;e it. The king
of Denmark bought the plate of the entry, and retained Tou&s;cher
in his &s;ervice. Mr. Nattier publi&s;hed a well-known book on ancient
gems, and died of an a&s;thma December 27, 1763, at St. Peter&s;|burgh,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Architects in the Reign of George II.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in this reign that architecture re&s;umed all her rights. Noble
publications of Palladio, Jones, and the antique, recalled her
to true principles and correct ta&s;te; &s;he found men of genius to ex|ecute
her rules, and patrons to countenance their labours. She found
more, and what Rome could not boa&s;t, men of the fir&s;t rank who
contributed to embelli&s;h their country by buildings of their own de&s;ign
in the pure&s;t &s;tyle of antique compo&s;ition. Before the glorious clo&s;e
of a reign that carried our arms and victories beyond where Roman
eagles ever flew, ardour for the arts had led our travellers to explore
whatever beauties of Grecian or Latin ta&s;te &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in provinces
once &s;ubjected to Rome; and the fine editions in con&s;equence of
tho&s;e re&s;earches have e&s;tabli&s;hed the throne of architecture in Britain,
while it&s;elf langui&s;hes at Rome, wantons in tawdry imitations of the
French in other parts of Europe, and &s;truggles in vain at Paris to
&s;urmount their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of their own errors&mdash;for fickle
as we call that nation, their mu&s;ic and architecture prove how long
their ears and eyes can be con&s;tant to di&s;cord and di&s;proportion.

<Q>GIACOMO LEONI,</Q>
a Venetian, who had been architect to the elector Palatine, &s;ettled in
England, and publi&s;hed a fine edition of Palladio in 1742. He
was employed in building &s;everal hou&s;es, and died in 1746.
<Q>JOHN NICHOLAS SERVANDONI,</Q>
a celebrated architect, re&s;ided here &s;ome years, though having va|rious
talents, he was be&s;t known in his own country as a painter.
He executed many &s;cenes for the opera, and painted a &s;tairca&s;e (in
conjunction with one Andrea) at Mr. Arundel's, the corner of Bur|lington-&s;treet,
now Mr. Town&s;hend's. He al&s;o gave the de&s;ign of
the theatre of fireworks for the peace in 1746, &s;oon after which he
returned to Paris. He was born at Florence May 2, 1695, &s;tudied
under Paolo Panini and Ro&s;&s;i, and was created a knight of the order
of Chri&s;t. His genius was particularly turned to theatric machinery,
of which he gave proofs at Dre&s;den and Li&s;bon, and e&s;pecially at
Paris, where he was received into the academy of painting and &s;culp|ture,
and where he contrived magnificent &s;erious pantomimes in the
grande &s;ale des machines, be&s;ides fine decorations in &s;everal operas.
An account of tho&s;e &s;hows may be &s;een in the fifth volume of the
Dictionaire des Theatres. His capital work was the facade of St.
Sulpice, but the enormous ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone which he has heaped on
the tops of the towers, and which are con&s;iderable enough to disfi|gure
the view of the city it&s;elf, de&s;troy the re&s;ult of &s;o &s;uperb a
fronti&s;piece.
<PB N="106" REF="135" MS="Y">
<Q>THOMAS RIPLEY</Q>
was born in York&s;hire, and executed &s;uch con&s;iderable works that
he mu&s;t not be omitted, though he wanted ta&s;te and fell under the
la&s;h of la&s;ting &s;atire. Pope has twice mentioned him,
<Q><L>Who builds a bridge, that never drove a pile?</L>
<L>Should Ripley venture, all the world would &s;mile.</L></Q>
And again,
<Q>And needs no rod but Ripley with a rule.</Q>
The truth is, politics and partiality concurred to help on the&s;e cen|&s;ures.
Ripley was employed by the mini&s;ter, and had not the coun|tenance
of lord Burlington, the patron of Pope. It is no le&s;s true,
that the admiralty is a mo&s;t ugly edifice, and de&s;ervedly veiled by
Mr. Adam's hand&s;ome &s;creen. Yet Ripley, in the mechanic part,
and in the di&s;po&s;ition of apartments and conveniencies, was unluckily
&s;uperior to the earl him&s;elf. Lord Orford's at Houghton, of which
Campbell gave the original de&s;ign, but which was much improved
by Ripley, and lord Walpole's at Woolterton, one of the be&s;t
hou&s;es of the &s;ize in England, will, as long as they remain, acquit
this arti&s;t of the charge of ignorance. I mu&s;t mention a more barba|rous

five orders for that &s;tyle. All that his books atchieved, has
been to teach carpenters to ma&s;&s;acre that venerable &s;pecies, and to
give occa&s;ion to tho&s;e who know nothing of the matter, and who

for building. He al&s;o invented an artificial &s;tone, of which he
made figures. An art lately brought to great perfection.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY HERBERT Earl of PEMBROKE.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oul of Inigo Jones, who had been patronized by his ance&s;tors,
&s;eemed &s;till to hover over its favourite Wilton, and to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the mu&s;es of arts in the education of this noble per&s;on. The towers,
the chambers, the &s;cenes which Holbein, Jones and Vandyck had
decorated, and which earl Thomas had enriched with the &s;poils of the
be&s;t ages, received the la&s;t touches of beauty from earl Henry's
hand. He removed all that ob&s;tructed the views to or from his pa|lace,
and threw Palladio's theatric bridge over his river: the pre&s;ent
lord has crowned the &s;ummit of the hill with the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of
Marcus Aurelius, and a hand&s;ome arch de&s;igned by Mr. Chambers.</P>
<P>No man had a purer ta&s;te in building than earl Henry, of which

<P>Never was protection and great wealth more generou&s;ly and more

of a genius and arti&s;t, except envy. Though his own de&s;igns were
more cha&s;te and cla&s;&s;ic than Kent's, he entertained him in his hou&s;e
till his death, and was more &s;tudious to extend his friend's fame
than his own. In the&s;e &s;heets I have mentioned many other in&s;tances
of the painters and arti&s;ts he encouraged and rewarded. Nor was
his munificence confined to him&s;elf and his own hou&s;es and gardens.
He &s;pent great &s;ums in contributing to public works, and was known
to chu&s;e that the expence &s;hould fall on him&s;elf, rather than that his
country &s;hould be deprived of &s;ome beautiful edifices. His enthu|&s;ia&s;m
for the works of Inigo Jones was &s;o active, that he repaired
the church of Covent-garden becau&s;e it was the production of that
great ma&s;ter, and purcha&s;ed a gateway at Beaufort-garden in Chel&s;ea,
and tran&s;ported the identical &s;tones to Chi&s;wick with religious attach|ment.
<PB REF="139">

With the &s;ame zeal for pure architecture he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Kent in
publi&s;hing the de&s;igns for Whitehall, and gave a beautiful edition of
the antique baths from the drawings of Palladio, who&s;e papers he

As we have few &s;amples of architecture more antique and impo&s;ing
than that colonade, I cannot help mentioning the effect it had on
my&s;elf. I had not only never &s;een it, but had never heard of it, at
lea&s;t with any attention, when &s;oon after my return from Italy, I
was invited to a ball at Burlington-hou&s;e. As I pa&s;&s;ed under the
gate by night, it could not &s;trike me. At day-break looking out of
the window to &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with the vi&s;ion of the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Campbell, in his Vitruvius Britannicus, a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the new front of Burlington-hou&s;e and the gateway, but as he takes no credit for the colon|ade, which is in a &s;tyle very &s;uperior to his de&s;igns, we may &s;afely conclude it was the earl's own.</NOTE> colonade that fronted me. It &s;eemed one of tho&s;e edifices in fairy|tales
that are rai&s;ed by genii in a night's time.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's hou&s;e at Chi&s;wick, the idea of which is borrowed
from a well-known villa of Palladio, is a model of ta&s;te, though not
without faults, &s;ome of which are occa&s;ioned by too &s;trict adherence
to rules and &s;ymmetry. Such are too many corre&s;pondent doors in
<PB N="110" REF="141">
&s;paces &s;o contracted; chimnies between windows, and which is
wor&s;e, windows between chimnies; and ve&s;tibules, however beauti|ful,
yet too little &s;ecured from the damps of this climate. The
tru&s;&s;es that &s;upport the cieling of the corner drawing-room are be|yond
mea&s;ure ma&s;&s;ive, and the ground apartment is rather a diminu|tive
catacomb, than a library in a northern latitude. Yet the&s;e
blemi&s;hes, and lord Hervey's wit, who &s;aid <HI>the hou&s;e was too &s;mall
to inhabit, and too large to hang to one's watch,</HI> cannot depreciate the
ta&s;te that reigns in the whole. The larger court, dignified by pic|ture&s;que
cedars, and the cla&s;&s;ic &s;cenery of the &s;mall court that unites
the old and new hou&s;e, are more worth &s;eeing than many fragments
of ancient grandeur, which our travellers vi&s;it under all the dangers
attendant on long voyages. The garden is in the Italian ta&s;te, but
dive&s;ted of conceits, and far preferable to every &s;tyle that reigned
till our late improvements. The buildings are heavy and not equal
to the purity of the hou&s;e. The lavi&s;h quantity of urns and &s;culp|ture
behind the garden-front &s;hould be retrenched.</P>

inconvenient, but the latter has &s;o beautiful a front, that lord Che&s;|terfield

<HEAD>WILLIAM KENT.</HEAD>
<P>Under the au&s;pices of lord Burlington and lord Pembroke, archi|tecture,
as I have &s;aid, recovered its genuine lu&s;tre. The former,
the Apollo of arts, found a proper prie&s;t in the per&s;on of Mr. Kent.
As I mean no panegyric on any man, beyond what he de&s;erved, or
what to the be&s;t of my po&s;&s;ibly erroneous judgment, I think he de|&s;erved,
I &s;hall &s;peak with equal impartiality on the merits and faults
of Kent, the former of which exceedingly preponderated. He was
a painter, an architect, and the father of modern gardening. In the
fir&s;t character, he was below mediocrity; in the &s;econd, he was a
re&s;torer of the &s;cience; in the la&s;t, an original, and the inventor of
an art that realizes painting, and improves nature. Mahomet ima|gined
an Ely&s;ium, but Kent created many.</P>
<P>He was born in York&s;hire, and put apprentice to a coach-painter,
but feeling the emotions of genius he left his ma&s;ter without leave,
and repaired to London; where he &s;tudied a little, and gave indica|tions
<PB N="112" REF="144">
enough of abilities to excite a generous patronage in &s;ome gen|tlemen
of his own county, who rai&s;ed a contribution &s;ufficient to
&s;end him to Rome, whither he accompanied Mr. Talman in 1710.
In that capital of the arts he &s;tudied under cavalier Luti, and in the
academy gained the &s;econd prize of the &s;econd cla&s;s; &s;till without
&s;u&s;pecting that there was a &s;i&s;ter art within his reach, more congenial
to his talents. Though his fir&s;t re&s;ources were exhau&s;ted, he &s;till
found friends. Another of his countrymen, &s;ir John Wentworth,
allowed him <HI>40l.</HI> a year for &s;even years. But it was at Rome that
his better &s;tar brought him acquainted with lord Burlington, who&s;e
&s;agacity di&s;covered the rich vein of genius that had been hid from
the arti&s;t him&s;elf. On their return to England in 1719, lord Bur|lington
gave him an apartment in his own hou&s;e, and added all the
graces of favour and recommendation. By that noble per&s;on's in|tere&s;t
Kent was employed in various works, both as a painter of hi&s;tory
and portrait; and yet it mu&s;t be allowed that in each branch par|tiality
mu&s;t have operated &s;trongly to make his lord&s;hip believe he
di&s;covered any merit in his friend. His portraits bore little re&s;em|blance
to the per&s;ons that &s;at for them; and the colouring was wor&s;e,
more raw and undetermined than that of the mo&s;t errant journeymen
to the profe&s;&s;ion. The whole lengths at E&s;her are &s;tanding evidences
of this a&s;&s;ertion. In his cielings, Kent's drawing was as defective as
the colouring of his portraits, and as void of every merit. I have
mentioned Hogarth's parody, if I may call it &s;o, of his picture at
St. Clement's. The hall at Wan&s;tead is another proof of his inca|pacity.
Sir Robert Walpole, who was per&s;uaded to employ him at
Houghton, where he painted &s;everal cielings and the &s;tairca&s;e, would
not permit him however to work in colours, which would have been
<PB N="113" REF="145">
&s;till more di&s;graced by the pre&s;ence of &s;o many capital pictures, but
re&s;trained him to chiaro &s;curo. If his faults are thence not &s;o glar|ing,
they are &s;carce le&s;s numerous. He painted a &s;tairca&s;e in the
&s;ame way for lord Town&s;hend at Rainham.</P>
<P>To compen&s;ate for his bad paintings, he had an excellent ta&s;te for
ornaments, and gave de&s;igns for mo&s;t of the furniture at Houghton,
as he did for &s;everal other per&s;ons. Yet cha&s;te as the&s;e ornaments
were, they were often unmea&s;urably ponderous. His chimney|pieces,
though lighter than tho&s;e of Inigo, whom he imitated, are
frequently heavy; and his con&s;tant introduction of pediments and
the members of architecture over doors, and within rooms, was di&s;|proportioned
and cumbrous. Indeed I much que&s;tion whether the
Romans admitted regular architecture <HI>within</HI> their hou&s;es. At lea&s;t
the di&s;coveries at Herculaneum te&s;tify, that a light and fanta&s;tic ar|chitecture,
of a very Indian air, made a common decoration of pri|vate
apartments. Kent's &s;tyle however predominated authoritatively
during his life; and his oracle was &s;o much con&s;ulted by all who
affected ta&s;te, that nothing was thought compleat without his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
He was not only con&s;ulted for furniture, as frames of pic|tures,
gla&s;&s;es, tables, chairs, &amp;c. but for plate, for a barge, for
a cradle. And &s;o impetuous was fa&s;hion, that two great ladies
prevailed on him to make de&s;igns for their birth-day gowns. The
one he dre&s;&s;ed in a petticoat decorated with columns of the five
orders; the other like a bronze, in a copper-coloured &s;attin with
ornaments of gold. He was not more happy in other works in which
he mi&s;applied his genius. The gilt rails to the hermitage at Rich|mond,
were in truth but a trifling impropriety; but his celebrated
monument of Shake&s;peare in the abbey was prepo&s;terous. What an
<PB N="114" REF="146">
ab&s;urdity to place bu&s;ts at the angles of a pede&s;tal, and at the bot|tom
of that pede&s;tal! Who&s;e choice the bu&s;ts were I do not know,
but though queen Elizabeth's head might be intended to mark the
aera in which the poet flouri&s;hed, why were Richard II. and Henry V.
&s;elected? Are the pieces under the names of tho&s;e princes two of
Shake&s;peare's mo&s;t capital works? or what rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned
for giving them the preference?</P>
<P>As Kent's genius was not univer&s;al, he has &s;ucceeded as ill in
Gothic. The King's-bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and Mr. Pelham's hou&s;e
at E&s;her, are proofs how little he conceived either the princples or
graces of that architecture. Yet he was &s;ometimes &s;en&s;ible of its
beauties, and publi&s;hed a print of Wol&s;ey's noble hall at Hampton|court,
now crouded and half hidden by a theatre. Kent gave the
de&s;ign for the ornaments of the chapel at the prince of Orange's wed|ding,
of which he al&s;o made a print.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His vignettes to the large edition of Pope's works are in a good ta&s;te.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such of the drawings as he de&s;igned for Gay's Fables, have &s;ome
truth and nature; but whoever would &s;earch for his faults, will find
an ample crop in a very favourite work of his, the prints for Spen|cer's
Fairy Queen. As the drawings were exceedingly cried up by
his admirers, and di&s;appointed the public in proportion, the blame
was thrown on the engraver, but &s;o far unju&s;tly, that though ill ex|ecuted,
the wretchedne&s;s of drawing, the total ignorance of per|&s;pective,
the want of variety, the di&s;proportion of the buildings,
and the awkwardne&s;s of the attitudes, could have been the faults of
the inventor only. There are figures i&s;&s;uing from cottages not &s;o
high as their &s;houlders, ca&s;tles in which the towers could not contain
<PB N="115" REF="147">
an infant, and knights who hold their &s;pears as men do who are
lifting a load &s;ideways. The land&s;capes are the only tolerable parts,
and yet the trees are &s;eldom other than young beeches to which Kent
as a planter was accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>But in architecture his ta&s;te was de&s;ervedly admired; and without
enumerating particulars, the &s;tairca&s;e at lady I&s;abella Finch's in
Berkeley-&s;quare is as beautiful a piece of &s;cenery, and con&s;idering
the &s;pace, of art, as can be imagined. The temple of Venus at
Stowe has &s;implicity and merit, and the great room at Mr. Pelham's
in Arlington-&s;treet, is as remarkable for magnificence. I do not
admire equally the room ornamented with marble and gilding at
Ken&s;ington. The &s;tairca&s;e there is the lea&s;t defective work of his
pencil; and his cielings in that palace from antique paintings, which
he fir&s;t happily introduced, &s;how that he was not too ridiculou&s;ly
prejudiced in favour of his own hi&s;toric compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Of all his works, his favourite production was the earl of Leice&s;|ter's
hou&s;e at Holkam in Norfolk. The great hall, with the flight
of &s;teps at the upper end, in which he propo&s;ed to place a colo&s;&s;al
Jupiter, was a noble idea. How the de&s;igns of that hou&s;e, which I
have &s;een an hundred times in Kent's original drawings, came to be
publi&s;hed under another name, and without the &s;lighte&s;t mention of
the real architect, is beyond comprehen&s;ion. The bridge, the tem|ple,
the great gateway, all built, I believe, the two fir&s;t certainly,
under Kent's own eye, are alike pa&s;&s;ed off as the works of another;
and yet no man need envy or deny him the glory of having oppre&s;&s;ed
a triumphal arch with an Egyptian pyramid. Holkam has its faults,
but they are Kent's faults, and marked with all the peculiarities of
his &s;tyle.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="148">
As I intend to con&s;ider him as the inventor of modern gardening
in a chapter by it&s;elf, I will conclude this account of him with the
few remaining circum&s;tances of his life. By the patronage of the
queen, of the dukes of Grafton and Newca&s;tle, and Mr. Pelham,
and by the intere&s;t of his con&s;tant friend, he was made ma&s;ter car|penter,
architect, keeper of the pictures, and, after the death of
Jervas, principal painter to the crown; the whole, including a pen|&s;ion
of <HI>100l.</HI> a year which was given him for his works at Ken&s;ing|ton,
producing <HI>600l.</HI> a year. In 1743 he had a di&s;order in his eyes
that was thought paralytic, but recovered. But in March 1748 he
had an inflammation both in his bowels and foot, which turned to a
general mortification, and put an end to his life at Burlington-hou&s;e,
April 12, 1748, in the &s;ixty-fourth year of his age. He was buried
in a very hand&s;ome manner in lord Burlington's vault at Chi&s;wick.
His fortune, which with pictures and books, amounted to about ten
thou&s;and pounds, he divided between his relations, and an actre&s;s
with whom he had long lived in particular friend&s;hip.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Henry Flitcroft was an arti&s;t much employed about this period. He built the church of St. Giles in the fields, the &s;teeple of which too much re&s;embled that of St. Martin. His too was the church of St. Olave, Southwark, reckoned the be&s;t of the new erections, but the tower was not fini&s;hed from the deficience of the allotted-fund. Flitcroft is buried in the church-yard at Teddington, and again&s;t the church is a &s;mall tablet with a Latin in&s;cription, which may be read from the road.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On modern Gardening.</HEAD>
<P>GARDENING was probably one of the fir&s;t arts that &s;ucceeded
to that of building hou&s;es, and naturally attended property and
individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Culinary, and afterwards medicinal herbs,
were the objects of every head of a family: it became convenient to
have them within reach, without &s;eeking them at random in woods,
in meadows, and on mountains, as often as they were wanted.
When the earth cea&s;ed to furni&s;h &s;pontaneou&s;ly all the&s;e primitive
luxuries, and culture became requi&s;ite, &s;eparate inclo&s;ures for rear|ing
herbs grew expedient. Fruits were in the &s;ame predicament,
and tho&s;e mo&s;t in u&s;e or that demand attention, mu&s;t have entered
into and extended the dome&s;tic inclo&s;ure. The good man Noah, we
are told, planted a vineyard, drank of the wine, and was drunken,
and every body knows the con&s;equences. Thus we acquired kitchen-gardens,
orchards, and vineyards. I am apprized that the proto|type
of all the&s;e &s;orts was the garden of Eden, but as that Paradi&s;e
was a good deal larger than any we read of afterwards, being in|clo&s;ed
by the rivers Pi&s;on, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates, as
<PB N="118" REF="150">
every tree that was plea&s;ant to the &s;ight and good for food grew in it,
and as two other trees were likewi&s;e found there, of which not a &s;lip
or &s;ucker remains, it does not belong to the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. After
the fall no man living was &s;uffered to enter into the garden; and the
poverty and nece&s;&s;ities of our fir&s;t ance&s;tors, hardly allowed them time
<HI>to make improvements on their e&s;tates</HI> in imitation of it, &s;uppo&s;ing any
plan had been pre&s;erved. A cottage and a &s;lip of ground for a cab|bage
and a goo&s;eberry-bu&s;h, &s;uch as we &s;ee by the &s;ide of a common,
were in all probability the earlie&s;t &s;eats and gardens: a well and
bucket &s;ucceeded to the Pi&s;on and Euphrates. As &s;ettlements in|crea&s;ed,
the orchard and the vineyard followed; and the earlie&s;t
princes of tribes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ju&s;t the nece&s;&s;aries of a modern farmer.</P>
<P>Matters, we may well believe, remained long in this &s;ituation;
and though the generality of mankind from their ideas from the im|port
of words in their own age, we have no rea&s;on to think that for
many centuries the term <HI>garden</HI> implied more than a kitchen-garden
or orchard. When a Frenchman reads of the garden of Eden, I do
not doubt but he concludes it was &s;omething approaching to that of
Ver&s;ailles, with clipt hedges, berceaus, and trellis-work. If his de|votion
humbles him &s;o far as to allow that, con&s;idering who de&s;igned
it, there might be a labyrinth full of Ae&s;op's fables, yet he does not
conceive that four of the large&s;t rivers in the world were half &s;o
magnificent as an hundred fountains full of &s;tatues by Girardon. It
is thus that the word <HI>garden</HI> has at all times pa&s;&s;ed for whatever was
under&s;tood by that term in different countries. But that it meant no
more than a kitchen-garden or orchard for &s;everal centuries, is evi|dent
from tho&s;e few de&s;criptions that are pre&s;erved of the mo&s;t fa|mous
gardens of antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="151">
That of Alcinous, in the Ody&s;&s;ey, is the mo&s;t renowned in the
heroic times. Is there an admirer of Homer who can read his de|&s;cription
without rapture; or who does not form to his imagination
a &s;cene of delights more picture&s;que than the land&s;capes of Tinian or
Juan Fernandez? Yet what was that boa&s;ted Paradi&s;e with which
the gods ordain'd
<Q>To grace Alcinous and his happy land? POPE.</Q>
Why, dive&s;ted of harmonious Greek and bewitching poetry, it was
a &s;mall orchard and vineyard, with &s;ome beds of herbs and two
fountains that watered them, inclo&s;ed within a quick&s;et hedge. The
whole compa&s;s of this pompous garden inclo&s;ed&mdash;four acres.
<Q><L>Four acres was th' allotted &s;pace of ground,</L>
<L>Fenc'd with a green inclo&s;ure all around.</L>
<L>The trees were apples, figs, pomgranates, pears, olives, and vines.</L>
<L>Tall thriving trees confe&s;s'd the fruitful mold;</L>
<L>The redning apple ripens into gold.</L>
<L>Here the blue fig with lu&s;cious juice o'erflows,</L>
<L>With deeper red the full pomegranate glows.</L>
<L>The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear,</L>
<L>And verdant olives flouri&s;h round the year.</L>
<L>Beds of all various herbs, for ever green,</L>
<L>In beauteous order terminate the &s;cene.</L></Q></P>
<P>Alcinous's garden was planted by the poet, enriched by him with the
fairy gift of eternal &s;ummer, and no doubt an effort of imagination
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing any thing he had ever &s;een. As he has be&s;towed on the
&s;ame happy prince a palace with brazen walls and columns of &s;ilver,
<PB N="120" REF="152">
he certainly intended that the garden &s;hould be proportionably mag|nificent.
We are &s;ure therefore that as late as Homer's age, an in|clo&s;ure
of four acres, comprehending orchard, vineyard and kitchen-garden,
was a &s;tretch of luxury the world at that time had never
beheld.</P>
<P>The hanging gardens of Babylon were a &s;till greater prodigy. We
are not acquainted with their di&s;po&s;ition or contents, but as they are
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been formed on terra&s;&s;es and the walls of the palace,
whither &s;oil was conveyed on purpo&s;e, we are very certain of what
they were not; I mean they mu&s;t have been trifling, of no extent,
and a wanton in&s;tance of expence and labour. In other words, they
were what &s;umptuous gardens have been in all ages till the pre&s;ent,
unnatural, enriched by art, po&s;&s;ibly with fountains, &s;tatues, balu&s;|trades,
and &s;ummer-hou&s;es, and were any thing but verdant and
rural.</P>
<P>From the days of Homer to tho&s;e of Pliny, we have no traces to
lead our gue&s;s to what were the gardens of the intervening ages.
When Roman authors, who&s;e climate in&s;tilled a wi&s;h for cool retreats,
&s;peak of their enjoyments in that kind, they &s;igh for grottos, caves,
and the refre&s;hing hollows of mountains, near irriguous and &s;hady
founts; or boa&s;t of their porticos, walks of planes, canals, baths and
breezes from the &s;ea. Their gardens are never mentioned as afford|ing
&s;hade and &s;helter from the rage of the dog-&s;tar. Pliny has
left us de&s;criptions of two of his villas. As he u&s;ed his Laurentine
villa for his winter-retreat, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the garden makes
no con&s;iderable part of the account. All he &s;ays of it is, that
the ge&s;tatio or place of exerci&s;e, which &s;urrounded the garden (the
<PB N="121" REF="153">
latter con&s;equently not being very large) was bounded by a hedge of
box, and where that was peri&s;hed, with ro&s;emary; that there was a
walk of vines, and that mo&s;t of the trees were fig and mulberry, the
&s;oil not being proper for any other &s;orts.</P>
<P>On his Tu&s;can villa he is more diffu&s;e, the garden makes a con|&s;iderable
part of the de&s;cription&mdash;and what was the principal beauty
of that plea&s;ure-ground? Exactly what was the admiration of this
country about three&s;core years ago; box-trees cut into mon&s;ters,
animals, letters, and the names of the ma&s;ter and the artificer. In
an age when architecture di&s;played all its grandeur, all its purity,
and all its ta&s;te; when aro&s;e Ve&s;pa&s;ian's amphitheatre, the temple of
Peace, Trajan's forum, Domitian's baths, and Adrian's villa, the
ruins and ve&s;tiges of which &s;till excite our a&s;toni&s;hment and curio&s;ity;
a Roman con&s;ul, a poli&s;hed emperor's friend, and a man of elegant
litterature and ta&s;te, delighted in what the mob now &s;carce admire
in a college-garden. All the ingredients of Pliny's corre&s;ponded ex|actly
with tho&s;e laid out by London and Wi&s;e on Dutch principles.
He talks of &s;lopes, terra&s;&s;es, a wilderne&s;s, &s;hrubs methodically trim|med,
a marble ba&s;on,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h gardens de&s;cribed by Hentzner in the reign of Elizabeth, are exact copies of tho&s;e of Pliny. In that at Whitehall was a &s;un-dial and jet-d'eau, which on turning a cock &s;purted out water and &s;prinkled the &s;pectators. In lord Burleigh's at Theobalds were obeli&s;ks, pyramids, and circular porticos, with ci&s;terns of lead for bathing. At Hampton-court the garden walls were covered with ro&s;emary, a cu&s;tom, he &s;ays, very common in England. At Theobald's was a labyrinth al&s;o, an ingenuity I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently to have been frequent in that age.</NOTE> pipes &s;pouting water, a ca&s;cade falling into
<PB N="122" REF="154">
the ba&s;on, bay-trees, alternately planted with planes, and a &s;trait
walk, from whence i&s;&s;ued others parted off by hedges of box, and
apple-trees, with obeli&s;ks placed between every two. There wants
nothing but the embroidery of a parterre, to make a garden in the
reign of Trajan &s;erve for a de&s;cription of one in that of king Wil|liam.
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Plot, in his natural hi&s;tory of Oxford&s;hire, p. 380, &s;eems to have been a great admirer of trees carved into the mo&s;t heterogeneous forms, which he calls <HI>topiary works,</HI> and quotes one Laurembergius for &s;aying that the Engli&s;h are as expert as mo&s;t nations in that kind of &s;culpture; for which Hampton-court was particularly remarkable. The doctor then names other gardens that flouri&s;hed with animals, and ca&s;tles, formed arte topiari&acirc;, and above all a wren's ne&s;t that was capacious enough to receive a man to &s;it on a &s;eat made within it for that purpo&s;e.</NOTE> In one pa&s;&s;age above Pliny &s;eems to have conceived that na|tural

vani&s;hed, lineal walks immediately enveloped the &s;light &s;cene, and

daring introduction of nature.</P>
<P>In the paintings found at Herculaneum are a few traces of gar|dens,
as may be &s;een in the &s;econd volume of the prints. They are
&s;mall &s;quare inclo&s;ures formed by trellis-work, and e&s;paliers,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Warwick-ca&s;tle is an ancient &s;uit of arras, in which there is a garden exactly re&s;embling the&s;e pictures of Herculaneum.</NOTE> and
regularly ornamented with va&s;es, fountains and careatides, elegantly
&s;ymmetrical, and proper for the narrow &s;paces allotted to the garden
of a hou&s;e in a capital city. From &s;uch I would not bani&s;h tho&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="155">
playful waters that refre&s;h a &s;ultry man&s;ion in town, nor the neat
trellis, which pre&s;erves it wooden verdure better than natural greens
expo&s;ed to du&s;t. Tho&s;e treillages in the gardens at Paris, particu|larly
on the Boulevard, have a gay and delightful effect.&mdash;They
form light corridores, and tran&s;picuous arbours through which the
&s;unbeams play and chequer the &s;hade, &s;et off the &s;tatues, va&s;es and
flowers, that marry with their gaudy hotels, and &s;uit the galant and
idle &s;ociety who paint the walks between their parterres, and realize
the fanta&s;tic &s;cenes of Watteau and Durf&egrave;.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, it appears how naturally and in&s;en&s;ibly the
idea of a kitchen-garden &s;lid into that which has for &s;o many ages
been peculiarly termed a garden, and by our ance&s;tors in this coun|try,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of a plea&s;ure-garden. A &s;quare piece
of ground was originally parted off in early ages for the u&s;e of the
family&mdash;to exclude cattle and a&s;certain the property it was &s;eparated
from the fields by a hedge. As pride and de&s;ire of privacy increa&s;ed,
the inclo&s;ure was dignified by walls; and in climes where fruits were
not lavi&s;hed by the ripening glow of nature and &s;oil, fruit-trees were
a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;heltered from &s;urrounding winds by the like expedient;
for the inundation of luxuries which have &s;welled into general nece&s;|&s;ities,
have almo&s;t all taken their &s;ource from the &s;imple fountain
of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>When the cu&s;tom of making &s;quare gardens inclo&s;ed with walls
was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, to the exclu&s;ion of nature and<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It was not uncommon, after the circumadjacent country had been &s;hut out, to endeavour to recover it by rai&s;ing large mounts of earth to peep over the walls of the garden.</NOTE> pro&s;pect,
<PB N="124" REF="156">
pomp and &s;olitude combined to call for &s;omething that might enrich
and enliven the in&s;ipid and unanimated partition. Fountains, fir&s;t
invented for u&s;e, which grandeur loves to di&s;gui&s;e and throw out of
the que&s;tion, received embelli&s;hments from co&s;tly marbles, and at
la&s;t to contradict utility, to&s;&s;ed their wa&s;te of waters into air in &s;pout|ing
columns. Art, in the hands of rude man, had at fir&s;t been
made a &s;uccedaneum to nature; in the hands of o&s;tentatious wealth,
it became the means of oppo&s;ing nature; and the more it traver&s;ed
the march of the latter, the more nobility thought its power was de|mon&s;trated.
Canals mea&s;ured by the line were introduced in lieu of
maeandring &s;treams, and terra&s;&s;es were hoi&s;ted aloft in oppo&s;ition to
the facile &s;lopes that imperceptibly unite the valley to the hill. Ba|lu&s;trades
defended the&s;e precipitate and dangerous elevations, and
flights of &s;teps rejoined them to the &s;ubjacent flat from which the
terra&s;s had been dug. Va&s;es and &s;culpture were added to the&s;e un|nece&s;&s;ary
balconies, and &s;tatues furni&s;hed the lifele&s;s &s;pot with mimic
repre&s;entations of the excluded &s;ons of men. Thus difficulty and
expence were the con&s;tituent parts of tho&s;e &s;umptuous and &s;elfi&s;h
&s;olitudes; and every improvement that was made, was but a &s;tep
farther from nature. The tricks of water-works to wet the unwary,
not to refre&s;h the panting &s;pectator, and parterres embroidered in
patterns like a petticoat, were but the childi&s;h endeavours of fa&s;hion
and novelty to reconcile greatne&s;s to what it had &s;urfeited on. To
crown the&s;e impotent di&s;plays of fal&s;e ta&s;te, the &s;heers were applied
to the lovely wildne&s;s of form with which nature has di&s;tingui&s;hed
each various &s;pecies of tree and &s;hrub. The venerable oak, the ro|mantic
beech, the u&s;eful elm, even the a&s;piring circuit of the lime,
<PB N="125" REF="157">
the regular round of the che&s;nut, and the almo&s;t moulded orange-tree,
were corrected by &s;uch fanta&s;tic admirers of &s;ymmetry. The
compa&s;s and &s;quare were of more u&s;e in plantations than the nur&s;ery|man.
The mea&s;ured walk, the quincunx, and the etoile impo&s;ed
their un&s;atisfying &s;amene&s;s on every royal and noble garden. Trees
were headed, and their &s;ides pared away; many French groves &s;eem
green che&s;ts &s;et upon poles. Seats of marble, arbours and &s;ummer-hou&s;es,
terminated every vi&s;to; and &s;ymmetry, even where the &s;pace
was too large to permit its being remarked at one view, was &s;o e&s;|&s;ential,
that, as Pope ob&s;erved,
<Q><L>&mdash;each alley has a brother,</L>
<L>And half the garden ju&s;t reflects the other.</L></Q>
Knots of flowers were more defen&s;ibly &s;ubjected to the &s;ame regu|larity.
Lei&s;ure, as Milton expre&s;&s;ed it,
in trim gardens took his plea&s;ure.
In the garden of mar&s;hal de Biron at Paris, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen
acres, every walk is buttoned on each &s;ide by lines of flower-pots,
which &s;ucceed in their &s;ea&s;ons. When I &s;aw it, there were nine
thou&s;and pots of A&s;ters, or la Reine Marguerite.</P>
<P>We do not preci&s;ely know what our ance&s;tors meant by a bower,
it was probably an arbour; &s;ometimes it meant the whole frittered
inclo&s;ure, and in one in&s;tance it certainly included a labyrinth.
Ro&s;amond's bower was indi&s;putably of that kind, though whether
compo&s;ed of walls or hedges we cannot determine. A &s;quare and a
round labyrinth were &s;o capital ingredients of a garden formerly, that
in Du Cerceau's architecture, who lived in the time of Charles IX.
and Henry III. there is &s;carce a ground-plot without one of each.
<PB N="126" REF="158">
The enchantment of antique appellations has con&s;ecrated a plea&s;ing
idea of a royal re&s;idence, of which we now regret the extinction.
Havering in the Bower, the jointure of many dowager queens, con|veys
to us the notion of a romantic &s;cene.</P>
<P>In Kip's views of the &s;eats of our nobility and gentry, we &s;ee the
&s;ame tire&s;ome and returning uniformity. Every hou&s;e is approached
by two or three gardens, con&s;i&s;ting perhaps of a gravel-walk and
two gra&s;s-plats, or borders of flowers. Each ri&s;es above the other
by two or three &s;teps, and as many walls and terra&s;&s;es; and &s;o many
iron-gates, that we recollect tho&s;e ancient romances, in which every
entrance was guarded by nymphs or dragons. At lady Orford's at
Piddletown in Dorfet&s;hire, there was, when my brother married, a
double inclo&s;ure of thirteen gardens, each I &s;uppo&s;e not an hundred
feet &s;quare, with an enfilade of corre&s;pondent gates; and before you
arrived at the&s;e, you pa&s;&s;ed a narrow gut between two &s;tone terra&s;&s;es,
that ro&s;e above your head, and which were crowned by a line of
pyramidal yews. A bowling-green was all the lawn admitted in
tho&s;e times, a circular lake the extent of magnificence.</P>
<P>Yet though the&s;e and &s;uch prepo&s;terous inconveniencies prevailed
from age to age, good &s;en&s;e in this country had perceived the want
of &s;omething at once more grand and more natural. The&s;e reflect|ions
and the bounds &s;et to the wa&s;te made by royal &s;poilers, gave
origine to parks. They were contracted fore&s;ts, and extended gar|dens.
Hentzner &s;ays, that according to Rous of Warwick the fir&s;t
park was that at Wood&s;tock. If &s;o, it might be the foundation of
a legend that Henry II. &s;ecured his mi&s;tre&s;s in a labyrinth: it was no
doubt more difficult to find her in a park than in a palace, when the
<PB N="127" REF="159">
intricacy of the woods and various lodges buried in covert might
conceal her actual habitation.</P>
<P>It is more extraordinary that having &s;o along ago &s;tumbled on the
principle of modern gardening, we &s;hould have per&s;i&s;ted in retaining
its rever&s;e, &s;ymmetrical and unnatural gardens. That parks were
rare in other countries, Hentzner, who travelled over great part of
Europe, leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, by ob&s;erving that they were common
in England. In France they retain the name, but nothing is more
different both in compa&s;s and di&s;po&s;ition. Their parks are u&s;ually
&s;quare or oblong inclo&s;ures, regularly planted with walks of che&s;nuts
or limes, and generally every large town has one for its public recre|ation.
They are exactly like Burton's court at Chel&s;ea-college, and
rarely larger.</P>

ancients had dropped not a hint of &s;uch divine &s;cenery, and
that the conceits in Italian gardens, and Theobalds and Non&s;uch,
were the brighte&s;t originals that his memory could furni&s;h. His in|tellectual

its proper office, the ju&s;t improvement or imitation of it.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Since the above was written, I have found Milton prai&s;ed and &s;ir William Temple cen&s;ured, on the &s;ame foundations, in a poem called, The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te in Planting, printed in in 1767.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that the concurrent te&s;timony of the age &s;hould &s;wear

what &s;hall we &s;ay for that intervening half century who could read

<P><PB N="130" REF="162">
Now let us turn to an admired writer, po&s;terior to Milton, and &s;ee
how cold, how in&s;ipid, how ta&s;tele&s;s is his account of what he pro|nounced
a perfect garden. I &s;peak not of his &s;tyle, which it was
not nece&s;&s;ary for him to animate with the colouring and glow of
poetry. It is his want of ideas, of imagination, of ta&s;te, that I
cen&s;ure, when he dictated on a &s;ubject that is capable of all the
graces that a knowledge of beautiful nature can be&s;tow. Sir Wil|liam
Temple was an excellent man; Milton, a genius of the fir&s;t
order.</P>
<P>We cannot wonder that &s;ir William declares in favour of parterres,
fountains and &s;tatues, as nece&s;&s;ary to break the &s;amene&s;s of large
gra&s;s-plats, which he thinks have an ill effect upon the eye, when he
acknowledges that he di&s;covers fancy in the gardens of Alcinous.
Milton &s;tudied the ancients with equal enthu&s;ia&s;m, but no bigotry,
and had judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h between the want of invention and
the beauties of poetry. Compare his Paradi&s;e with Homer's garden,
both a&s;cribed to a cele&s;tial de&s;ign. For &s;ir William, it is ju&s;t to ob|&s;erve,
that his ideas centured in a fruit-garden. He had the honour
of giving to his country many delicate fruits, and he thought of
little el&s;e than di&s;po&s;ing them to the be&s;t advantage. Here is the
pa&s;&s;age I propo&s;ed to quote; it is long, but I need not make an
apology to the reader for entertaining him with any other words in|&s;tead
of my own.</P>
<P>&startq;The be&s;t figure of a garden is either a &s;quare or an oblong,&endq; and
either upon a flat or a de&s;cent: they have all their beauties, but the
be&s;t I e&s;teem an oblong upon a de&s;cent. The beauty, the air, the
view makes amends for the expence, which is very great in fini&s;hing
<PB N="131" REF="163">
and &s;upporting the terras-walks, in levelling the parterres, and in
the &s;tone-&s;tairs that are nece&s;&s;ary from one to the other.</P>
<P>&startq;The perfecte&s;t figure of a garden I ever &s;aw, either at home or
abroad, was that of Moor-park in Hertford&s;hire, when I knew it
about thirty years ago. It was made by the counte&s;s of Bedford,
e&s;teemed among the greate&s;t wits of her time, and celebrated by
doctor Donne; and with very great care, excellent contrivance and
much co&s;t; but greater &s;ums may be thrown away without effect or
honour, if there want &s;en&s;e in proportion to money, or <HI>if nature be
not followed,</HI> which I take to be the great rule in this, and perhaps
in every thing el&s;e, as far as the conduct not only of our lives, but
our governments.&endq; [We &s;hall &s;ee how <HI>natural</HI> that admired garden
was.]</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e I take<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This garden &s;eems to have been made after the plan laid down by lord Ba|con in his 46th e&s;&s;ay, to which, that I may not multiply quotations, I will re|fer the reader.</NOTE> the garden I have named to have been in all
kinds the mo&s;t beautiful and perfect,&endq; at lea&s;t in the figure and di&s;|po&s;ition
that I have ever &s;een, I will de&s;cribe it for a model to tho&s;e
that meet with &s;uch a &s;ituation, and are above the regards of com|mon
expence. It lies on the &s;ide of a hill, upon which the hou&s;e
&s;tands, but not very &s;teep. The length of the hou&s;e, where the be&s;t
rooms and of mo&s;t u&s;e or plea&s;ure are, lies upon the breadth of the
garden; the great parlour opens into the middle of a terras gravel-walk
that lies even with it, and which may lie, as I remember, about
three hundred paces long, and broad in proportion; the border &s;et
with &s;tandard laurels and at large di&s;tances, which have the beauty
<PB N="132" REF="164">
of orange-trees out of flower and fruit. From this walk are three
de&s;cents by many &s;tone &s;teps, in the middle and at each end, into a
very large parterre. This is divided into quarters by gravel-walks,
and adorned with two fountains and eight &s;tatues in the &s;everal quar|ters.
At the end of the terras-walk are two &s;ummer-hou&s;es, and the
&s;ides of the parterre are ranged with two large cloi&s;ters open to the
garden, upon arches of &s;tone, and ending with two other &s;ummer-hou&s;es
even with the cloi&s;ters, which are paved with &s;tone, and de&s;ign|ed
for walks of &s;hade, there being none other in the whole parterre.
Over the&s;e two cloi&s;ters are two terra&s;&s;es covered with lead and fenced
with balu&s;ters; and the pa&s;&s;age into the&s;e airy walks is out of the two
&s;ummer-hou&s;es at the end of the fir&s;t terras-walk. The cloi&s;ter facing
the &s;outh is covered with vines, and would have been proper for an
orange-hou&s;e, and the other for myrtles or other more common
greens, and had, I doubt not, been ca&s;t for that purpo&s;e, if this
piece of gardening had been then in as much vogue as it is now.</P>
<P>&startq;From the middle of this parterre is a de&s;cent by many &s;teps
flying on each &s;ide of a grotto that lies between them,&endq; covered with
lead and flat, into the lower garden, which is all fruit-trees ranged
about the &s;everal quarters of a wilderne&s;s which is very &s;hady; the
walks here are all green, the grotto embelli&s;hed with figures of &s;hell|rock-work,
fountains, and water-works. If the hill had not ended
with the lower garden, and the wall were not bounded by a common
way that goes through the park, they might have added a third
quarter of all greens; but this want is &s;upplied by a garden on the
other &s;ide the hou&s;e, which is all of that &s;ort, very wild, &s;hady, and
adorned with rough rock-work and fountains.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="165">
&startq;This was Moor-park, when I was acquainted with it, and the
&s;weete&s;t place, I think, that I have &s;een in my life, either before or
&s;ince, at home or abroad.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>I will make no farther remarks on this de&s;cription. Any man
might de&s;ign and <HI>build</HI> as &s;weet a garden, who had been born in and
never &s;tirred out of Holbourn. It was not peculiar to &s;ir William
Temple to think in that manner. How many Frenchmen are there
who have &s;een <HI>our</HI> gardens, and &s;till prefer <HI>natural</HI> flights of &s;teps
and &s;hady cloi&s;ters covered with lead! Le Nature, the architect of
the groves and grottoes at Ver&s;ailles, came hither on a mi&s;&s;ion to
improve our ta&s;te. He planted St. James's and Greenwich parks&mdash;no
great monuments of his invention.</P>
<P>To do farther ju&s;tice to &s;ir William Temple, I mu&s;t not omit
what he adds. &startq;What I have &s;aid of the be&s;t forms of gardens, is
meant only of &s;uch as are in &s;ome &s;ort regular; for there may be
other forms wholly irregular, that may, for aught I know, have
more beauty than any of the others; but they mu&s;t owe it to &s;ome
extraordinary di&s;po&s;itions of nature in the &s;eat, <HI>or &s;ome great race of
fancy or judgment in the contrivance,</HI> which may reduce many di&s;a|greeing
parts <HI>into &s;ome figure,</HI> which &s;hall yet, upon the whole, be
very agreable. Something of this I have &s;een in &s;ome places, but
heard more of it from others, who have lived much among the Chi|ne&s;es,
a people who&s;e way of thinking &s;eems to lie as wide of ours
in Europe, as their country does.&mdash;Their greate&s;t reach of imagina|tion
is employed in contriving figures, where the beauty &s;hall be
great and &s;trike the eye, but without any order or di&s;po&s;ition of
parts, that &s;hall be commonly or ea&s;ily ob&s;erved. And though we
<PB N="134" REF="166">
have hardly any notion of this &s;ort of beauty, yet they have a parti|cular
word to expre&s;s it; and where they find it hit their eye at fir&s;t
&s;ight, they &s;ay the Sharawadgi is fine or is admirable, or any &s;uch
expre&s;&s;ion of e&s;teem&mdash;but I &s;hould hardly advi&s;e any of the&s;e at|tempts
in the figure of gardens among us, they are adventures of
too hard atchievement for any common hands; and though there
may be more honour if they &s;ucceed well, yet there is more di&s;ho|nour
if they fail, and it is twenty to one they will; whereas in re|gular
figures, it is hard to make any great and remarkable faults.&endq;</P>
<P>Fortunately Kent and a few others were not quite &s;o timid, or we
might &s;till be going up and down &s;tairs in the open air.</P>
<P>It is true, we have heard much lately, as &s;ir william Temple did,
of irregularity and imitations of nature in the gardens or grounds of
the Chine&s;e. The former is certainly true; they are as whim&s;ically
irregular, as European gardens are formally uniform, and unvaried&mdash;but
with regard to nature, it &s;eems as much avoided, as in the
&s;quares and oblongs, and &s;trait lines of our ance&s;tors. An artificial
perpendicular rock &s;tarting out of a flat plain, and connected with
nothing, often pierced through in various places with oval hollows,
has no more preten&s;ion to be deemed natural than a lineal terra&s;s or
a parterre. The late Mr. Jo&s;eph Spence, who had both ta&s;te and
zeal for the pre&s;ent &s;tyle, was &s;o per&s;uaded of the Chine&s;e emperor's
plea&s;ure-ground being laid out on principles re&s;embling ours, that he
tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed, under the name of &s;ir Harry Beaumont, a
particular account of that inclo&s;ure from the collection of the letters
of the Je&s;uits. I have looked it over, and except a determined irre|gularity,
can find nothing in it that gives me any idea of attention
<PB N="135" REF="167">
being paid to nature. It is of va&s;t circumference and contains 200
palaces, be&s;ides as many contiguous for the eunuchs, all gilt, paint|ed
and varni&s;hed. There are rai&s;ed hills from 20 to 60 feet high,
&s;treams and lakes, and one of the latter five miles round. The&s;e
waters are pa&s;&s;ed by bridges&mdash;but even their bridges mu&s;t not be
&s;trait&mdash;they &s;erpentize as much as the rivulets, and are &s;ometimes &s;o
long as to be furni&s;hed with re&s;ting places, and begin and end with
triumphal arches. Methinks a &s;trait canal is as rational at lea&s;t as a
maeandring bridge. The colonades undulate in the &s;ame manner.
In &s;hort, this pretty gaudy &s;cene is the work of caprice and whim;
and when we reflect on their buildings, pre&s;ents no image but that of
un&s;ub&s;tantial tawdrine&s;s. Nor is this all. Within this fanta&s;tic Pa|radi&s;e
is a &s;quare town, each &s;ide a mile long. Here the eunuchs
of the court, to entertain his imperial maje&s;ty with the bu&s;tle and
bu&s;ine&s;s of the capital in which he re&s;ides, but which it is not of his
dignity ever to &s;ee, act merchants and all &s;orts of trades, and even
de&s;ignedly exerci&s;e for his royal amu&s;ement every art of knavery that
is practiced under his au&s;picious government. Methinks this is the
childi&s;h &s;olace and repo&s;e of grandeur, not a retirement from affairs
to the delights of rural life. Here too his maje&s;ty plays at agricul|ture;
there is a quarter &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e; the eunuchs &s;ow,
reap, and carry in their harve&s;t in the imperial pre&s;ence; and his
maje&s;ty returns to Pekin per&s;uaded that he has been in the country.</P>
<P>Having thus cleared my way by a&s;certaining what have been the
ideas on gardening in all ages, as far as we have materials to judge
by, it remains to &s;how to what degree Mr. Kent invented the new
&s;tyle, and what hints he had received to &s;ugge&s;t and conduct his un|dertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="168">
We have &s;een what Moor-park was, when pronounced a &s;tandard.
But as no &s;ucceeding generation in an opulent and luxurious country
contents it&s;elf with the perfection e&s;tabli&s;hed by its ance&s;tors, more
perfect perfection was &s;till &s;ought; and improvements had gone on,
till London and Wi&s;e had &s;tocked our gardens with giants, animals,
mon&s;ters,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On the piers of a garden-gate not far from Paris I ob&s;erved two very coquet &s;phinxes.

Ab|&s;urdity
could go no farther, and the tide turned. Bridgman, the
next fa&s;hionable de&s;igner of gardens, was far more cha&s;te; and whe|ther
from good &s;en&s;e, or that the nation had been &s;truck and reform|ed
by the admirable paper in the Guardian, N&deg; 173, he bani&s;hed

the foregoing age. He enlarged his plans, di&s;dained to make every
divi&s;ion tally to its oppo&s;ite, and though he &s;till adhered much to
&s;trait walks with high clipped hedges, they were only his great lines;
the re&s;t he diver&s;ified by wilderne&s;s, and with loo&s;e groves of oak,
though &s;till within &s;urrounding hedges. I have ob&s;erved in the
garden<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;eat of the late &s;ir Jeremy Sambroke.

&s;trongly indicate the dawn of modern ta&s;te. As his reformation gain|ed

appearance, by the &s;ides of tho&s;e endle&s;s and tire&s;ome walks, that
&s;tretched out of one into another without intermi&s;&s;ion. But this was
not till other innovators had broke loo&s;e too from rigid &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>But the capital &s;troke, the leading &s;tep to all that has followed,
was [I believe the fir&s;t thought was Bridgman's] the de&s;truction of
walls for boundaries, and the invention of fo&s;s&egrave;s&mdash;an attempt then
deemed &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that the common people called them Ha!
Ha's! to expre&s;s their &s;urprize at finding a &s;udden and unperceived
check to their walk.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t gardens planted in this &s;imple though &s;till formal
&s;tyle, was my father's at Houghton. It was laid out by Mr. Eyre,
an imitator of Bridgman. It contains three-and-twenty acres, then
reckoned a con&s;iderable portion.</P>
<P>I call a &s;unk fence the leading &s;tep, for the&s;e rea&s;ons. No &s;ooner
was this &s;imple enchantment made, than levelling, mowing and roll|ing,
followed. The contiguous ground of the park without the
&s;unk fence was to be harmonized with the lawn within; and the gar|den
in its turn was to be &s;et free from its prim regularity, that it
might a&s;&s;ort with the wilder country without. The &s;unk fence a&s;|certained
the &s;pecific garden, but that it might not draw too obvious
a line of di&s;tinction between the neat and the rude, the contiguous
out-lying parts came to be included in a kind of general de&s;ign: and
when nature was taken into the plan, under improvements, every
&s;tep that was made, pointed out new beauties and in&s;pired new ideas.
At that moment appeared Kent, painter enough to ta&s;te the charms
of land&s;cape, bold and opinionative enough to dare and to dictate,
and born with a genius to &s;trike out a great &s;y&s;tem from the twilight
<PB N="138" REF="170">
of imperfect e&s;&s;ays. He leaped the fence, and &s;aw that all nature
was a garden. He felt the delicious contra&s;t of hill and valley chang|ing
imperceptibly into each other, ta&s;ted the beauty of the gentle
&s;well, or concave &s;coop, and remarked how loo&s;e groves crowned
an ea&s;y eminence with happy ornament, and while they called in the
di&s;tant view between their graceful &s;tems, removed and extended
the per&s;pective by delu&s;ive compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus the pencil of his imagination be&s;towed all the arts of land|&s;cape
on the &s;cenes he handled. The great principles on which he
worked were per&s;pective, and light and &s;hade. Groupes of trees
broke too uniform or too exten&s;ive a lawn; evergreens and woods
were oppo&s;ed to the glare of the champain, and where the view was
le&s;s fortunate, or &s;o much expo&s;ed as to be beheld at once, he blot|ted
out &s;ome parts by thick &s;hades, to divide it into variety, or to
make the riche&s;t &s;cene more enchanting by re&s;erving it to a farther
advance of the &s;pectator's &s;tep. Thus, &s;electing favourite objects,
and veiling deformities by &s;creens of plantation; &s;ometimes allowing
the rude&s;t wa&s;te to add its foil to the riche&s;t theatre, he realized the
compo&s;itions of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in painting. Where objects
were wanting to animate his horizon, his ta&s;te as an architect could
be&s;tow immediate termination. His buildings, his &s;eats, his temples,
were more the works of his pencil than of his compa&s;&s;es. We owe
the re&s;toration of Greece and the diffu&s;ion of architecture to his &s;kill
in land&s;cape.</P>
<P>But of all the beauties he added to the face of this beautiful coun|try,
none &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his management of water. Adieu to canals, cir|cular
ba&s;ons, and ca&s;cades tumbling down marble &s;teps, that la&s;t ab|&s;urd

magnificence of Italian and French villas. The forced elevation
of cataracts was no more. The gentle &s;tream was taught to &s;er|pentize
&s;eemingly at its plea&s;ure, and where di&s;continued by dif|ferent
levels, its cour&s;e appeared to be concealed by thickets properly
inter&s;per&s;ed, and glittered again at a di&s;tance where it might be &s;up|po&s;ed
naturally to arrive. Its borders were &s;moothed, but pre&s;erved
their waving irregularity. A few trees &s;cattered here and there on
its edges &s;prinkled the tame bank that accompanied its maeanders;
and when it di&s;appeared among the hills, &s;hades de&s;cending from the
heights leaned towards its progre&s;s, and framed the di&s;tant point of
light under which it was lo&s;t, as it turned a&s;ide to either hand of the
blue horizon.</P>
<P>Thus dealing in none but the colours of nature, and catching its
mo&s;t favourable features, men &s;aw a new creation opening before
their eyes. The living land&s;cape was cha&s;tened or poli&s;hed, not
transformed. Freedom was given to the forms of trees; they ex|tended
their branches unre&s;tricted, and where any eminent oak, or
ma&s;ter beech had e&s;caped maiming and &s;urvived the fore&s;t, bu&s;h and
bramble was removed, and all its honours were re&s;tored to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
and &s;hade the plain. Where the united plumage of an ancient
wood extended wide its undulating canopy, and &s;tood venerable in
its darkne&s;s, Kent thinned the foremo&s;t ranks, and left but &s;o many
detached and &s;cattered trees, as &s;oftened the approach of gloom and
blended a chequered light with the thus lengthened &s;hadows of the
remaining columns.</P>
<P>Succeeding arti&s;ts have added new ma&s;ter-&s;trokes to the&s;e touches;
perhaps improved or brought to perfection &s;ome that I have named.
<PB N="140" REF="172">
The introduction of foreign trees and plants, which we owe princi|pally
to Archibald duke of Argyle, contributed e&s;&s;entially to the
richne&s;s of colouring &s;o peculiar to our modern land&s;cape. The mix|ture
of various greens, the contra&s;t of forms between our fore&s;t-trees
and the northern and We&s;t-Indian firs and pines, are improvements
more recent than Kent, or but little known to him. The weeping-willow
and every florid &s;hrub, each tree of delicate or bold leaf, are
new tints in the compo&s;ition of our gardens. The la&s;t century was
certainly acquainted with many of tho&s;e rare plants we now admire.
The Weymouth-pine has long been naturalized here; the patriarch
plant &s;till exi&s;ts at Longleat. The light and graceful acacia was
known as early; witne&s;s tho&s;e ancient &s;tems in the court of Bedford|hou&s;e
in Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare; and in the bi&s;hop of London's garden
at Fulham are many exotics of very ancient date. I doubt therefore
whether the difficulty of pre&s;erving them in a clime &s;o foreign to their
nature did not convince our ance&s;tors of their inutility in general,
unle&s;s the &s;hapeline&s;s of the lime and hor&s;e-che&s;nut which accorded
&s;o well with e&s;tabli&s;hed regularity, and which thence and from their
novelty grew in fa&s;hion, did not occa&s;ion the neglect of the more
curious plants.</P>
<P>But ju&s;t as the encomiums are that I have be&s;towed on Kent's
di&s;coveries, he was neither without a&s;&s;i&s;tance or faults. Mr. Pope
undoubtedly contributed to form his ta&s;te. The de&s;ign of the prince
of Wales's garden at Carlton-hou&s;e was evidently borrowed from
the poet's at Twickenham. There was a little of affected mode&s;ty
in the latter, when he &s;aid of all his works he was mo&s;t proud of his
garden. And yet it was a &s;ingular effort of art and ta&s;te to impre&s;s
<PB N="141" REF="173">
&s;o much variety and &s;cenery on a &s;pot of five acres. The pa&s;&s;ing
through the gloom from the grotto to the opening day, the retiring
and again a&s;&s;embling &s;hades, the du&s;ky groves, the larger lawn, and
the &s;olemnity of the termination at the cypre&s;&s;es that lead up to his
mother's tomb, are managed with exqui&s;ite judgment; and though
lord Peterborough a&s;&s;i&s;ted him
<Q>To form his quincunx and to rank his vines,</Q>
tho&s;e were not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing ingredients of his little per&s;pective.</P>
<P>I do not know whether the di&s;po&s;ition of the garden at Rou&s;ham,
laid out for general Dormer, and in my opinion the mo&s;t engaging
of all Kent's works, was not planned on the model of Mr. Pope's, at
lea&s;t in the opening and retiring &s;hades of Venus's vale. The whole
is as elegant and antique as if the emperor Julian had &s;elected the
mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;olitude about Daphne to enjoy a philo&s;ophic retirement.</P>
<P>That Kent's ideas were but rarely great, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure
owing to the novelty of his art. It would have been difficult to have
tran&s;ported the &s;tyle of gardening at once from a few acres to tum|bling
of fore&s;ts: and though new fa&s;hions like new religions, [which
are new fa&s;hions] often lead men to the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite exce&s;&s;es, it
could not be the ca&s;e in gardening, where the experiments would
have been &s;o expen&s;ive. Yet it is true too that the features in Kent's
land&s;capes were &s;eldom maje&s;tic. His clumps were puny, he aimed
at immediate effect, and planted not for futurity. One &s;ees no large
woods &s;ketched out by his direction. Nor are we yet entirely ri&s;en
above a too great frequency of &s;mall clumps, e&s;pecially in the elbows
of &s;erpentine rivers. How common to &s;ee three or four beeches, then
as many larches, a third knot of cypre&s;&s;es, and a revolution of all
<PB N="142" REF="174">
three! Kent's la&s;t de&s;igns were in a higher &s;tyle, as his ideas opened
on &s;ucce&s;s. The north terras at Claremont was much &s;uperior to the
re&s;t of the garden.</P>
<P>A return of &s;ome particular thoughts was common to him with
other painters, and made his <HI>hand</HI> known. A &s;mall lake edged by
a winding bank with &s;cattered trees that led to a &s;eat at the head of
the pond, was common to Claremont, E&s;her, and others of his de|&s;igns.
At E&s;her,
<Q>Where Kent and nature vied for Pelham's love,</Q>
the pro&s;pects more than aided the painter's genius.&mdash;They marked
out the points where his art was nece&s;&s;ary or not; but thence left
his judgment in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its glory.</P>
<P>Having routed <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> art, for the modern gardiner exerts his
talents to conceal his art, Kent, like other reformers, knew not how
to &s;top at the ju&s;t limits. He had followed nature, and imitated her
&s;o happily, that he began to think all her works were equally proper
for imitation. In Ken&s;ington-garden he planted dead trees, to give
a greater air of truth to the &s;cene&mdash;but he was &s;oon laughed out of
this exce&s;s. His ruling principle was, that <HI>nature abhors a &s;trait line.</HI>&mdash;His
mimics, for every genius has his apes, &s;eemed to think that
&s;he could love nothing but what was crooked. Yet &s;o many men of
ta&s;te of all ranks devoted them&s;elves to the new improvements, that
it is &s;urprizing how much beauty has been &s;truck out, with how few
ab&s;urdities. Still in &s;ome lights the reformation &s;eems to me to have
been pu&s;hed too far. Though an avenue cro&s;&s;ing a park or &s;epa|rating
a lawn, and intercepting views from the &s;eat to which it leads,
<PB N="143" REF="175">
are capital faults, yet a great avenue<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Of this kind one of the mo&s;t noble is that of Stan&s;tead, the &s;eat of the earl of Halifax, traver&s;ing an ancient wood for two miles and bounded by the &s;ea. The very exten&s;ive lawns at that &s;eat, richly inclo&s;ed by venerable beech woods, and chequered by &s;ingle beeches of va&s;t &s;ize, particularly when you &s;tand in the portico of the temple and &s;urvey the land&s;cape that wa&s;tes it&s;elf in rivers of broken &s;ea, recall &s;uch exact pictures of Claud Lorrain, that it is difficult to conceive that he did not paint them from this very &s;pot.</NOTE> cut through woods, perhaps
before entering a park, has a noble air, and
<Q><L>Like footmen running before coaches</L>
<L>To tell the inn what lord approaches,</L></Q>
announces the habitation of &s;ome man of di&s;tinction. In other places
the total bani&s;hment of all particular neatne&s;s immediately about
a hou&s;e, which is frequently left gazing by it&s;elf in the middle of a
park, is a defect. Sheltered and even clo&s;e walks in &s;o very uncer|tain
a climate as ours, are comforts ill exchanged for the few pic|ture&s;que
days that we enjoy: and whenever a family can purloin a
warm and even &s;omething of an old fa&s;hioned garden from the land|&s;cape
de&s;igned for them by the undertaker in fa&s;hion, without inter|fering
with the picture, they will find &s;atisfactions on tho&s;e days that
do not invite &s;trangers to come and &s;ee their improvements.</P>
<P>Fountains have with great rea&s;on been bani&s;hed from gardens as
unnatural; but it &s;urprizes me that they have not been allotted to
their proper po&s;itions, to cities, towns, and the courts of great
hou&s;es, as proper accompaniments to architecture, and as works of
grandeur in them&s;elves. Their decorations admit the utmo&s;t inven|tion,
and when the waters are thrown up to different &s;tages, and
<PB N="144" REF="176">
tumble over their border, nothing has a more impo&s;ing or a more
refre&s;hing &s;ound. A palace demands its external graces and attri|butes,
as much as a garden. Fountains and cypre&s;&s;es peculiarly be|come
buildings, and no man can have been at Rome, and &s;een the
va&s;t ba&s;ons of marble da&s;hed with perpetual ca&s;cades in the area of
St. Peter's, without retaining an idea of ta&s;te and &s;plendor. Tho&s;e
in the piazza Navona are as u&s;eful as &s;ublimely conceived.</P>
<P>Grottoes in this climate are rece&s;&s;es only to be looked at tran|&s;iently.
When they are regularly compo&s;ed within of &s;ymmetry and
architecture, as in Italy, they are only &s;plendid improprieties. The
mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly, indeed mo&s;t fortunately placed grotto, is that at
Stourhead, where the river bur&s;ts from the urn of its god, and pa&s;&s;es
on its cour&s;e through the cave.</P>
<P>But it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to lay down rules for gardens, but to give
the hi&s;tory of them. A &s;y&s;tem of rules pu&s;hed to a great degree of
refinement, and collected from the be&s;t examples and practice, has
been lately given in a book intituled <HI>Ob&s;ervations on modern Gardening.</HI>
The work is very ingeniou&s;ly and carefully executed, and in point
of utility rather exceeds than omits any nece&s;&s;ary directions. The
author will excu&s;e me if I think it a little exce&s;s, when he examines
that rude and unappropriated &s;cene of Matlocke-bath, and criticizes
nature for having be&s;towed on the rapid river Derwent too many ca&s;|cades.
How can this cen&s;ure be brought home to gardening? The
management of rocks is a province can fall to few directors of gar|dens;
&s;till in our di&s;tant provinces &s;uch a guide may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The author divides his &s;ubject into gardens, parks, farms, and
ridings. I do not mean to find fault with this divi&s;ion. Directions
<PB N="145" REF="177">
are requi&s;ite to each kind, and each has its department at many of
the great &s;cenes from whence he drew his ob&s;ervations. In the hi&s;|toric
light, I di&s;tingui&s;h them into the garden that connects it&s;elf
with a park, into the ornamented farm, and into the fore&s;t or &s;avage
garden. Kent, as I have &s;hown, invented or e&s;tabli&s;hed the fir&s;t
&s;ort. Mr. Philip Southcote founded the &s;econd or ferme orn&egrave;e, of
which is a very ju&s;t de&s;cription in the author I have been quoting.
The third I think he has not enough di&s;tingui&s;hed. I mean that kind
of alpine &s;cene, compo&s;ed almo&s;t wholly of pines and firs, a few
birch, and &s;uch trees as a&s;&s;imilate with a &s;avage and mountainous
country. Mr. Charles Hamilton, at Pain's-hill, in my opinion has
given a perfect example of this mode in the utmo&s;t boundary of his
garden. All is great and foreign and rude; the walks &s;eem not de|&s;igned,
but cut through the wood of pines; and the &s;tyle of the
whole is &s;o grand, and conducted with &s;o &s;erious an air of wild and
uncultivated extent, that when you look down on this &s;eeming fore&s;t,
you are amazed to find it contain a very few acres. In general, ex|cept
as a &s;creen to conceal &s;ome deformity, or as a &s;helter in winter,
I am not fond of total plantations of ever-greens. Firs in particular
from a very ungraceful &s;ummit, all broken into angles.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Englefield was one of the fir&s;t improvers on the new
&s;tyle, and &s;elected with &s;ingular ta&s;te that chief beauty of all gardens,
pro&s;pect and fortunate points of view. We tire of all the painter's art
when it wants the&s;e fini&s;hing touches. The faire&s;t &s;cenes, that de|pend
on them&s;elves alone, weary when often &s;een. The Doric por|tico,
the Palladian bridge, the Gothic ruin, the Chine&s;e pagoda,
that &s;urprize the &s;tranger, &s;oon lo&s;e their charms to their &s;urfeited
<PB N="146" REF="178">
ma&s;ter. The lake that floats the valley is &s;till more lifele&s;s, and its
lord &s;eldom enjoys his expence but when he &s;hows it to a vi&s;itor.
But the ornament who&s;e merit &s;oone&s;t fades, is the hermitage or
&s;cene adapted to contemplation. It is almo&s;t comic to &s;et a&s;ide a
quarter of one's garden to be melancholy in. Pro&s;pect, animated
pro&s;pect, is the theatre that will always be the mo&s;t frequented.
Pro&s;pects formerly were &s;acrificed to convenience and warmth. Thus
Burleigh &s;tands behind a hill, from the top of which it would com|mand
Stamford. Our ance&s;tors who re&s;ided the greate&s;t part of the
year at their &s;eats, as others did two years together or more, had an
eye to comfort fir&s;t, before expence. Their va&s;t man&s;ions received
and harboured all the younger branches, the dowagers and ancient
maiden aunts of the families, and other families vi&s;ited them for a
month together. The method of living is now totally changed, and
yet the &s;ame &s;uperb palaces are &s;till created, becoming a pompous
&s;olitude to the owner, and a tran&s;ient entertainment to a few tra|vellers.</P>
<P>If any incident aboli&s;hes or re&s;trains the modern &s;tyle of gardening,
it will be this circum&s;tance of &s;olitarine&s;s. The greater the &s;cene,
the more di&s;tant it is probably from the capital; in the neighbour|hood
of which land is too dear to admit con&s;iderable extent of pro|perty.
Men tire of expence that is obvious to few &s;pectators. Still
there is a more imminent danger that threatens the pre&s;ent, as it
has ever done, all ta&s;te. I mean the pur&s;uit of variety. A modern
French writer has in a very affected phra&s;e given a ju&s;t account of
this, I will call it, di&s;temper. He &s;ays, <HI>l'ennui du beau amene le
gout du &s;ingulier.</HI> The noble &s;implicity of the Augu&s;tan age was
<PB N="147" REF="179">
driven out by fal&s;e ta&s;te. The gigantic, the puerile, the quaint,
and at la&s;t the barbarous, and the monki&s;h, had each their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
admirers. Mu&s;ic has been improved, till it is a &s;cience of tricks
and &s;light of hand: the &s;ober greatne&s;s of Titian is lo&s;t, and paint|ing
&s;ince Carlo Maratti, has little more relief than Indian paper.
Borromini twi&s;ted and curled architecture, as if it was &s;ubject to the
change of fa&s;hions like a head of hair. If we once lo&s;e &s;ight of the
propriety of land&s;cape in our gardens, we &s;hall wander into all the
fanta&s;tic &s;harawadgis of the Chine&s;e. We have di&s;covered the point
of perfection. We have given the true model of gardening to the
world; let other countries mimic or corrupt our ta&s;te; but let it
reign here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant &s;implicity,
and proud of no other art than that of &s;oftening nature's har&s;hne&s;&s;es
and copying her graceful touch.</P>
<P>The ingenious author of the Ob&s;ervations on modern Gardening
is, I think, too rigid when he condemns &s;ome deceptions, becau&s;e
they have been often u&s;ed. If tho&s;e deceptions, as a feigned &s;teeple
of a di&s;tant church, or an unreal bridge to di&s;gui&s;e the termination
of water, were intended only to &s;urpri&s;e, they were indeed tricks that
would not bear repetition; but being intended to improve the land|&s;cape,
are no more to be condemned becau&s;e common, than they
would be if employed by a painter in the compo&s;ition of a picture.
Ought one man's garden to be deprived of a happy object, becau&s;e
that object has been employed by another? The more we exact
novelty, the &s;ooner our ta&s;te will be vitiated. Situations are every
where &s;o various, that there never can be a &s;amene&s;s, while the di&s;|po&s;ition
of the ground is &s;tudied and followed, and every incident of
view turned to advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="180">
In the mean time how rich, how gay, how picture&s;que the face of
the country! The demolition of walls laying open each improve|ment,
every journey is made through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pictures; and
even where ta&s;te is wanting in the &s;pot improved, the general view is
embelli&s;hed by variety. If no relap&s;e to barbari&s;m, formality, and
&s;eclu&s;ion, is made, what land&s;capes will dignify every quarter of our
i&s;land, when the daily plantations that are making have attained
venerable maturity! A &s;pecimen of what our gardens will be, may
be &s;een at Petworth, where the portion of the park neare&s;t the hou&s;e
has been allotted to the modern &s;tyle. It is a garden of oaks two
hundred years old. If there is a fault in &s;o augu&s;t a fragment of
improved nature, it is, that the &s;ize of the trees are out of all pro|portion
to the &s;hrubs and accompanyments. In truth, &s;hrubs &s;hould
not only be re&s;erved for particular &s;pots and home delight, but are
pa&s;&s;ed their beauty in le&s;s than twenty years.</P>
<P>Enough has been done to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a &s;chool of land&s;cape, as
cannot be found on the re&s;t of the globe. If we have the &s;eeds of a
Claud or a Ga&s;par among&s;t us, he mu&s;t come forth. If wood, wa|ter,
groves, vallies, glades, can in&s;pire or poet or painter, this is
the country, this is the age to produce them. The flocks, the herds,
that now are admitted into, now graze on the borders of our culti|vated
plains, are ready before the painter's eyes, and groupe them|&s;elves
to animate his picture. One misfortune in truth there is that
throws a difficulty on the arti&s;t. A principal beauty in our gardens
is the lawn and &s;moothne&s;s of turf: in a picture it becomes a dead
and uniform &s;pot, incapable of chiaro &s;curo, and to be broken
in&s;ipidly by children, dogs, and other unmeaning $igures.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="181">
Since we have been familiarized to the &s;tudy of land&s;cape, we hear
le&s;s of what delighted our &s;port&s;men-ance&s;tors, <HI>a fine open country.</HI>
Wilt&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and &s;uch ocean-like extents were formerly
preferred to the rich blue pro&s;pects of Kent, to the Thames-watered
views in Berk&s;hire, and to the magnificent &s;cale of nature in York|&s;hire.
An open country is but a canva&s;s on which a land&s;cape might
be de&s;igned.</P>
<P>It was fortunate for the country and Mr. Kent, that he was &s;uc|ceeded
by a very able ma&s;ter; and did living arti&s;ts come within my
plan, I &s;hould be glad to do ju&s;tice to Mr. Brown; but he may be a
gainer, by being re&s;erved for &s;ome abler pen.</P>
<P>In general it is probably true, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if he has any ta&s;te,
mu&s;t be the be&s;t de&s;igner of his own improvements. He &s;ees his
&s;ituation in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, at all times of the day. He
knows where beauty will not cla&s;h with convenience, and ob&s;erves in
his &s;ilent walks or accidental rides a thou&s;and hints that mu&s;t e&s;cape
a per&s;on who in a few days &s;ketches out a pretty picture, but has not
had lei&s;ure to examine the details and relations of every part.</P>
<P>Truth, which after the oppo&s;ition given to mo&s;t revolutions, pre|ponderates
at la&s;t, will probably not carry our &s;tyle of garden into
general u&s;e on the continent. The expence is only &s;uited to the opu|lence
of a free country, where emulation reigns among many inde|pendent
particulars. The keeping of our grounds is an ob&s;tacle, as
well as the co&s;t of the fir&s;t formation. A flat country, like Holland,
is incapable of land&s;cape. In France and Italy the nobility do not
re&s;ide much, and make &s;mall expence at their villas. I &s;hould think
the little princes of Germany, who &s;pare no profu&s;ion on their pa|laces
<PB N="150" REF="182">
and country-hou&s;es, mo&s;t likely to be our imitators; e&s;pecially
as their country and climate bears in many parts re&s;emblance to ours.
In France, and &s;till le&s;s in Italy, they could with difficulty attain that
verdure which the humidity of our clime be&s;tows as the ground-work
of our improvements. As great an ob&s;tacle in France is the em|bargo
laid on the growth of their trees. As after a certain age,
when they would ri&s;e to bulk, they are liable to be marked by the
crown's &s;urveyors as royal timber, it is a curio&s;ity to &s;ee an old tree.
A land&s;cape and a crown-&s;urveyor are incompatible.</P>
<P>I have thus brought down to the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t reign [the
period I had marked to this work] the hi&s;tory of our arts and arti&s;ts,
from the earlie&s;t aera in which we can be &s;aid to have had either.
Though there have been only gleams of light and fla&s;hes of genius,
rather than progre&s;&s;ive improvements, or flouri&s;hing &s;chools; the
inequality and in&s;ufficience of the execution, have flowed more from
my own defects than from tho&s;e of the &s;ubject. The merits of the
work, if it has any, are owing to the indefatigable indu&s;try of Mr.
Vertue, in ama&s;&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible materials. As my ta&s;k is fini&s;hed,
it will, I hope, at lea&s;t excite others to collect and pre&s;erve notices
and anecdotes for &s;ome future continuator. The aera promi&s;es to
furni&s;h a nobler harve&s;t. Our exhibitions, and the in&s;titution of a
royal academy, excite emulation in the arti&s;ts, diffu&s;e their repu|tation,
and recommend them to employment. The public examines
and rea&s;ons on their works, and &s;pectators by degrees become judges.
Nor are per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank meer patrons. Lord Nuneham's
etchings are &s;uperior in boldne&s;s and freedom of &s;troke to any thing
we have &s;een from e&s;tabli&s;hed arti&s;ts. Gardening and architecture
<PB N="151" REF="183">
owe as much to the nobility and to men of fortune as to the profe&s;|&s;ors.
I need but name general Conway's ru&s;tic bridge at Park-place,
of which every &s;tone was placed by his own direction in one of the
mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes in nature; and the theatric &s;tairca&s;e de&s;igned

If a model is &s;ought of the mo&s;t perfect ta&s;te in architecture, where
grace &s;oftens dignity, and lightne&s;s attempers magnificence; where
proportion removes every part from peculiar ob&s;ervation, and deli|cacy
of execution recalls every part to notice; where the po&s;ition is
the mo&s;t happy, and even the colour of the &s;tone the mo&s;t harmo|nious;

nature, improved by the cha&s;tity of art. Such an aera will
demand a better hi&s;torian. With plea&s;ure therefore I re&s;ign my pen;
pre&s;uming to recommend nothing to my &s;ucce&s;&s;or, but to ob&s;erve as
&s;trict impartiality.</P>
