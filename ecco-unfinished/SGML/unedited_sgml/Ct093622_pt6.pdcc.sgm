<HEAD>THE WISH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM DUNCOMBE, ESQ <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Younger &s;on of John Duncombe e&s;q. of Stocks in Hert|ford&s;hire. In 1722 he publi&s;hed a tran&s;lation of Racine's "Athaliah," which was well received by the publick, and has gone through three editions. In 1724 he was editor of the Works of Mr. Needler; in 1735 of the Poems of his de|cea&s;ed brother-in-law Mr. Hughes, in two volumes, 12mo; in 1737 of the Mi&s;cellanies of his younger brother Mr. Jabez Hughes, for the benefit of his widow, in one volume, 8vo; and in 1745 of the Works of the Rev. Mr. Samuel Say, in one volume, 4to. In 1726 he married the only &s;i&s;ter of John Hughes e&s;q. whom he long &s;urvived. In 1734 his tragedy of "Lucius Junius Brutus" was acted at Drury Lane Theatre; &s;ee "Letters of Eminent Per&s;ons," vol. III. p. 144. It was publi&s;hed in 1735, and again in 1747. "The Works of Ho|race, in Engli&s;h Ver&s;e, by &s;everal Hands," were publi&s;hed by him in two volumes 8vo. with notes, &amp;c. in 1757. A &s;econd edition, in four volumes 12mo. with many imitations, was publi&s;hed in 1762. In 1763 he collected and republi&s;hed
<Q>&startq;Seven Sermons by Archbi&s;hop Herring, on public Oc|ca&s;ions, with a biographical Preface.&endq;</Q>
He died Feb. 26, 1769, aged 80; leaving one &s;on, John, M. A. one of the &s;ix preachers in Chri&s;t-Church, Canterbury, &amp;c. who was his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the tran&s;lation of Horace; and to whom I ac|knowledge my&s;elf indebted, not only for the&s;e poems and the portrait of his father, but for much u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this and other publications.

<HEAD>TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would have been an acceptable pre&s;ent to the publick if I had been able to have prefixed to one of the&s;e volume a portrait of this amiable peer. I cannot, however, b$ &s;ubmit to my readers &s;ome curious particulars on the &s;ubject which have been kindly communicated by a gentleman whe$ name I am not at liberty to di&s;clo&s;e:
<Q>&startq;Mr. Grange makes no mention of any print of Lord Ro&s;commo$ nor can I find any account of a picture of him; but Dr. Chetwode's M&s;. Life of him &s;ays, if I remember right, that the print prefixed to his Poems [I &s;uppo&s;e he means &s;ome edition of his Poems in the latter end of the la&s;t or the beginning of the pre&s;ent century] was very like him; and that Lord Ro&s;common very &s;trongly re&s;embled the famous Lord Strafford. By the bye, all the Biographers &s;eem to have been ignorant as to the degree of relation&s;hip between the&s;e two per&s;ons; and, what is very extraordinary, Dr. Chetwode him&s;elf does not appear to have known how nearly they were related. The fact is, that Lord Ro&s;common was Lord Strafford's <HI>nephew</HI>; his father, Sir James Dillon, the third earl of Ro&s;common, having married Elizabeth the younge&s;t daughter of Sir William Wentworth, of Wentworth Woodhou&s;e, in the county of York, &s;i&s;ter to the Earl of Strafford. Hence Lord Ro&s;common was chri&s;|tened <HI>Wentworth</HI>; and probably was born in 1633, when Lord Strafford was in Ireland. His father died at Lime|rick in 1649. The Poet, on the &s;econd of November, 1674, married, as his &s;econd wife, I&s;abella daughter of Matthew Boynton, e&s;q. of York&s;hire. This, I believe, has not been mentioned. As to what the Biographers &s;ay of Lord Stra&s;|$d's &s;ending over for him, <HI>after the breaking out of the civil wars</HI>, and placing him near his country-&s;eat in York&s;hire, it mu&s;t be a mi&s;take. If Lord Strafford &s;ent for him at all, it mu&s;t have been at &s;ome earlier period; for he him&s;elf was beheaded <HI>$fore</HI> the civil war can properly be &s;aid to have begun. Probably he brought his nephew with him from Ireland in 1640, on his return from his government. It is not, I believe, generally known that all the particulars of Lord Ro&s;common, related by Fenton, are taken from Chetwode's <HI>M$ac$s</HI> of that nobleman, with which he pro|bably was furni&s;hed by Mr. Thomas Baker, who left them, with many other Manu&s;cripts, to the Library of St. John's College, Cambridge. The Life of Lord Ro&s;common is very ill written, full of high-church cant and common|place ob&s;ervation.&endq;</Q> N.</NOTE> OCCASIONED BY HIS LORDSHIP'S ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE.

<HEAD>ON A LADY'S HAND-WRITING,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GEORGE JEFFREYS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, who was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool under Dr. Bu&s;by, was the &s;on of Chri&s;topher Jeffreys, e&s;&abque; of Weldron in Northampton&s;hire, and nephew to James the 8th lord Chandos. He was admitted of Trinity College, Cam|bridge, in 1694, where he took the degrees in arts, was elected fellow in 1701, and pre&s;ided in the philo&s;ophy-&s;chools as mo|derator in 1706. He was al&s;o &s;ub-orator for Dr. Ayloffe, and not going into orders within eight years, as the &s;tatutes of that college require, he quitted his fellow&s;hip in 1709. Though Mr. Jeffreys was called to the bar, he never practi&s;ed the law, but, after acting as &s;ecretary to Dr. Hart&s;tonge bi&s;hop of Derry, at the latter end of queen Anne's and the beginning of George the Fir&s;t's reign, &s;pent mo&s;t of the remainder of his life in the families of the two la&s;t dukes of Chandos, his re|lations. In 1754 he publi&s;hed, by &s;ub&s;cription, a 4to volume of "Mi&s;cellanies, in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e," among which are two tragedies, (viz. "Edwin" and "Merope," both acted at the theatre-royal in Lincoln's-Inn-fields) and "The Tri|umph of Truth," an oratorio. "This collection (as the author ob&s;erves in his dedication to the pre&s;ent duke of Chan|dos, then marque&s;s of Carnarvon,) includes an uncommon length of time, from the ver&s;es on the duke of Glouce&s;ter'i death in 1700 to tho&s;e on his lord&s;hip's marriage in 1753." Mr. Jeffreys died in 1755, aged 77. See Letters of Emi|nent Per&s;ons, vol. II. p. 17.&mdash;In Sir John Hawkins's "Hi&s;|tory of Mu&s;ic," vol. IV. p. 64. his grandfather, George, is recorded as King Charles the Fir&s;t's organi&s;t at Oxford, 1643, and &s;ervant to Lord Hatton in Northampton&s;hire, where he had lands of his own; and al&s;o his father, Chri&s;topher, of Weldron in Northampton&s;hire. p. 323, as "a &s;tudent of Chri&s;t-Church, who played well on the organ."

<HEAD>TO MR. CONGREVE, ON HIS PLAYS AND POEMS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MRS. ELIZABETH TOLLET <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daughter of George Tollet, e&s;q. who, as a commi&s;&s;ioner of the navy, had a hou&s;e in the Tower in the reigns of King William and Queen Anne. Sir I&s;aac Newton honoured both him and his daughter with his friend&s;hip, and was much plea&s;ed with &s;ome of her fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays. She has paid a grateful tribute to the memory of that great man in a copy of ver&s;es, [p. 69.] Her works (publi&s;hed after her death, which happened in 1754) abound with &s;entiment and &s;implicity (beauties rarely to be found in modern poems), and yet are far from being de&s;titute of &s;pirit and poetical ornament. Some of the poems indeed have &s;uch a philo&s;ophical ca&s;t, and &s;o great a depth of thought, that they will &s;carcely be under&s;tood by the <HI>beau monde</HI>. The worthy author's head and heart con|curred in promoting the cau&s;e of Good-manners, Virtue, and Religion. She would not &s;uffer her poems to appear till &s;he her&s;elf was beyond the reach of envy or applau&s;e. They are very incorrectly printed. The writer of this note has them corrected, with contents prefixed. She left her e&s;tate (a pretty good one) to her younge&s;t nephew. Her elde&s;t, George Tollet e&s;q. of Betley Hall in Stafford&s;hire, a gentleman of letters and fortune, well known by his curious illu&s;trations of Shak&s;peare, died October 22, 1779.

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK I. EP. VIII.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE, ESQ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very ingenious and elegant poet, born at Burton upon Trent, Jan. 21, 1705-6, was educated fir&s;t at Litch|field, and then at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where he &s;oon became a peculiar favourite of Dr. Freind, the head ma&s;ter. After &s;taying more than a year in the upper form, he was re|moved, when little more than &s;ixteen, to Trinity College, Cambridge, and continued at the Univer&s;ity till he had taken the degree of M.A. Having been always intended for the bar, he &s;ettled in Lincoln's Inn about 1727, and pro&s;ecuted for &s;eve|ral years with great attention the &s;tudy of the law, in which he obtained a great degree of profe&s;&s;ional knowledge; but his fortune enabled him to decline the pur&s;uit of practice long before his death. His application to bu&s;ine&s;s both at Cam|br$dge and at Lincoln's Inn was occa&s;ionally diver&s;ified by the exerci&s;e of his poetical talents; of which an excellent collection was given to the publick by his &s;on in 1768. Mr. Browne married Feb. 10, 1743-4, Jane daughter of Arch|deacon Trimnell, by whom he had one &s;on, the pre&s;ent I&s;a$ Hawkins Browne e&s;q. He was twice elected into parliament f$ Wenlock in Shrop&s;hire, in 1744 and 1748; and died Feb. 14. 1760, in the fifty-fifth year of his age. A good account of him is given in the Biographia Britannica, 1780, vol. II. p. 647; where Dr. Kippis ob&s;erves, that &s;everal of Mr. Browne's poems remain in manu&s;cript, but that "many of them would do him no &s;mall honour, and afford &s;trong proofs of the wit and humour which he &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed." Several of his poems are in Mr. Dod&s;ley's Collection. N.</NOTE>. F. R. S. NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>1. TO MISS HIGHMORE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Mrs. Duncombe. N.</NOTE>; SENT ON VALENTINE'S DAY. NEVER BEFORE PRINTED <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thomas Edwards, e&s;q. had a good paternal e&s;tate at Terrick in Bucks; and was the la&s;t of his family, as appears by his 5th Sonnet in Dod&s;ley, where he pathetically laments the lo&s;s of four brothers and as many &s;i&s;ters. He was an excellent &s;cholar, having been thoroughly grounded in the Cla&s;&s;icks at Eton School, whence he was removed to King's College, Cambridge. He afterwards applied him&s;elf in Lincoln's Inn to the &s;tudy of the law (his father and grandfather having been of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion). He &s;pent the la&s;t 1$ years of his life principally at Turrick; died on a vi&s;$t at his friend Mr. Richard&s;on's at Par&s;on's Green, the 3d of Jan. 1757, aged 58; and was buried at Elle&s;borough in Buckingham&s;hire. His nephews (&s;i&s;ter's &s;ons) were h$ heirs. He was equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for his genius and the goodne&s;s of his heart. His "Canons of Critici&s;m" did him great credit, both as a critic and as a &s;cholar, and of cour&s;e provoked the vengeance of Dr. Warburton, which he wreak|ed very illiberally in a note on the Dunciad (IV. 567); of which Mr. Edwards was more &s;u&s;ceptible than he need have been, deeming his gentility impeached by the words "<HI>a Gentle|man</HI>, as he is plea&s;ed to call him&s;elf, of Lincoln's Inn, but, in reality, a Gentleman only of the Dunciad," &amp;c. Thirteen of his Sonnets are printed in Dod&s;ley's, eight in Pearch's, and four in this Collection. Twenty-&s;even others may be &s;een in the la&s;t edition of his "Canons of Critici&s;m, 1765." He was al&s;o author of a pamphlet called "Free and candid Thoughts on the Doctrine of Prede&s;tina|tion." See Dr. Aken&s;ide's and Mrs. Chapone's Odes to him. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>VERSES BY MR. STILLINGFLEET<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grand&s;on to the well-known bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and equally di&s;tingui&s;hed as a naturali&s;t and a poet. His father Edward was fellow of St. John's College in Cambridge, F. R. S. M. D. and Gre&s;ham Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ic; but, mar|rying in 1692, lo&s;t his lucrative offices, and the bi&s;hop's favour: a misfortune that affected both him and his po&s;terity. However, going into orders, he obtained, by his father's means, the living of Newington-Butts, which he immediately exchanged for tho&s;e of Wood-Norton and Swanton in Nor|folk. He died in 1708. Benjamin, his only &s;on, was edu|cated at Norwich &s;chool, which he le&s;t in 1720, with the character of an excellent &s;cholar. He then went to Trinity College in Cambridge, at the reque&s;t of Dr. Bentley, the ma&s;ter, who had been private tutor to his father, dome&s;tic $haplain to his grandfather, and was much indebted to the $amily. Here he was a candidate for a fellow&s;hip; but was $ejected by the ma&s;ter's influence. This was a &s;evere and $nexpected di&s;appointment; and but little alleviated after|wards by the Doctor's apology, that it was a pity that a gen|tleman of Mr. Stillingfleet's parts &s;hould be buried within the walls of a college. Perhaps, however, this ingratitude of Dr. Bentley was not of any real di&s;&s;ervice to Mr. Stillingfleet. By being thrown into the world, he formed many honourable and valuable connections. The late Lord Barrington gave him, in a very polite manner, the place of ma&s;ter of the bar|racks at Ken&s;ington; a favour to which Mr. Stilling|fleet, in the dedication of his "Calendar of Flora" to that nobleman, alludes with great politene&s;s, as well as the warme&s;t gratitude. His "Calendar" was formed at Stratton in Norfolk, in 1755, at the ho&s;pitable &s;eat of Mr. Mar&s;ham, who had made &s;everal ob&s;ervations of that kind, and had communicated to the publick his curious
<Q>&startq;Ob&s;er|&endq;vations on the Growth of Trees.</Q>
But it was to Mr. Wyndham, of Felbrig in Norfolk, that he appears to have had the greate&s;t obligations: he travelled abroad with him; &s;pent much of his time at his hou&s;e; and was appointed one of his executors; with a con&s;iderable addition to an annuity which that gentleman had &s;ettled upon him in his life-time, Mr. Stillingfleet's genius &s;eems, if we may judge from his works, to have led him principally to the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory, which he pro&s;ecuted as an ingenious philo&s;opher, an u&s;eful citizen, and a good man. In this walk of learning he mentions, as his friends, Dr. Wat&s;on, Mr. (now Dr.) So|lander, Mr. Hud&s;on, Mr. Price of Foxley, and &s;ome others. Mr. Gray makes the following favourable mention of him, in one of his letters dated from London, in 1761; "I have lately made an acquaintance with this philo&s;opher, who lives in a garret in the winter, that he may &s;upport &s;ome near re|lations who depend upon him. He is always employed, con|&s;equently (according to my old maxim) always happy, always chearful, and &s;eems to me a worthy hone&s;t man. His pre&s;ent &s;cheme is to &s;end &s;ome per&s;ons, properly qualified, to re&s;ide a year or two in Attic$, to make them&s;elves acquainted with the climate, productions, and natural hi&s;tory of the country, that we may under&s;tand Ari&s;totle, Theophra&s;tus, &amp;c. who have been Heathen Greek to us for &s;o many ages; and this he has got propo&s;ed to Lord Bute, no unlikely per&s;on to put it in execution, as he is him&s;elf a botani&s;t." A beautiful elo|gium on him, by Mr. Pennant, is prefixed to the fourth vo|lume of the "Briti&s;h Zoology." An epi&s;tle by Mr. Stillingfleet, in 1723, is printed in the Poetical Magazine, 1764, p. 224. He publi&s;hed, about 1733, an anonymous pam|phlet, intituled, "Some Thoughts concerning Happine&s;s;" and in 1759 appeared a volume of "Mi&s;cellaneous Tracts," which is in much e&s;teem, and does great honour both to his head and heart. They are chiefly tran&s;lations of &s;ome e&s;&s;ays in the "Amoenitates Academicae," publi&s;hed by Lin|naeus, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome ob&s;ervations and additions of his own. In this volume he &s;hews a ta&s;te for cla&s;&s;ical learn|ing, and entertains us with &s;ome elegant poetical effu&s;ions. He annexed to it &s;ome valuable "Ob&s;ervations on Gra&s;&s;es," and dedicated the whole to George Lord Lyttelton. A &s;econd edi|tion of it appeared in 1762; a third in 1775. Mr. Stilling&s;teet likewi&s;e publi&s;hed "Some Thoughts occa&s;ioned by the late Earthquakes, 1750," a poem in 4to. "Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, an Oratorio, &s;et to Mu&s;ic by Stanley, 1760," 4to. and "The Principles and Powers of Harmony, 1771," 4to. a very learned work, built on Tartini's <HI>Trattato di Mu&s;ica &s;econdo la verra Sci|enza dell' Armonia</HI>. The&s;e, and his "E&s;&s;ay on Conver&s;ation," in the fir&s;t volume of Dod&s;ley's Collection of Poems, en|title him to a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank among our Engli&s;h poets. The "E&s;&s;ay" is addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Wyndham with all that warmth of friend&s;hip which di&s;tingui&s;hes Mr. Stillingfleet. As it is chiefly didactic, it does not admit of &s;o many orna|ments as &s;ome compo&s;itions of other kinds. However, it contains much good-&s;en&s;e, &s;hews a con&s;iderable knowledge of mankind, and has &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages that, in point of harmony and ea&s;y ver&s;ification, would not di&s;grace the writings of our mo&s;t admired poets. Here more than once Mr. Stillingfleet &s;hews him&s;elf &s;till &s;ore from Dr. Bentley's cruel treatment of him; and towards the beautiful and moral clo&s;e of it (where he gives us a &s;ketch of him&s;elf) &s;eems to hint at a mortifi|cation of a more delicate nature, which he is &s;aid to have &s;uffered from the other &s;ex. This too may perhaps account for the a&s;perity with which he treats the ladies in the
<Q>&startq;Ver|&s;es&endq;</Q>
here printed. To the&s;e di&s;appointments it was perhaps owing that Mr. Stillingfleet neither married, nor went into orders. His London re&s;idence was at a &s;adler's in Pic|cadilly, where he died in 1771, aged above &s;eventy, leaving &s;everal valuable papers behind him. To the&s;e Mr. Pennant $lludes, when he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;I received the unfini&s;hed tokens of his regard by virtue of his promi&s;e; the only papers that were re&s;cued from the flames to which his mode&s;ty had de|voted all the re&s;t.&endq;</Q>
He was buried in St. James's church, $hout the &s;lighte&s;t monument of his having e$ded. See $e Gentleman's Magazine, for 1776, p. 162, 496; for 1777, $. 440; whence this note is principally taken. N.</NOTE>

A. of Je&s;us College, Cambridge, "An An&s;wer to Mr. Whi&s;ton's Seventeen Su&s;picions concern|ing Athana&s;ius, in his Hi&s;torical Preface, by Styan Thirlby, 1712" In 1723 he was editor of "Ju&s;tin Martyr," the dedi|cation to which has always been con&s;idered as a ma&s;terly pro|duction, in &s;tyle particularly. The late learned Dr. Jortin, who was one of his pupils, was very early in life recommended by him to tran&s;late &s;ome of Eu&s;tathius's notes for the u&s;e of Pope's Homer; (&s;ee a letter of Mr. Fenton's, in the Additions to Pope, vol. II. p. 106.). He left college many years before his death, and re&s;ided in London, fir&s;t at Sir Edward Wal|pole's, and afterwards in private lodgings. He was fond of the common law, and &s;tudied it; and, after he came to Lon|don, had thoughts of being entered at one of the Inns of Court, and being called to the bar; but that &s;cheme he after|wards declined, and lived very retired, &s;eeing only a few of his friends. Dr. Thirlby once had a de&s;ign to publi&s;h Shak|&s;peare; and Dr. Jortin undertook to read over that poet, with a view to mark the pa&s;&s;ages where he had either imitated Greek or Latin writers, or at lea&s;t had fallen into the &s;ame thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions. Dr. Thirlby dropt the de&s;ign; but left a Shak&s;peare, with many marginal notes and corrections, which is at pre&s;ent in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir Edward Walpole, to whom he bequeathed all his books and papers. In the la&s;t edition of that matchle&s;s dramati&s;t, Dr. Thirlby's name occurs early in the li&s;t of commentators. He was appointed a king's waiter in the port of London, in May 1741, a &s;inecure place worth about 100l. per annum, procured for him by Sir Edward Walpole. He died December 19, 1753.

<HEAD>SONG, ON THE TWO MISS CRADDOCKS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE LATE SIR THOMAS BURNET <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Younge&s;t &s;on of the Bi&s;hop. He was author of "A &s;e|cond Tale of a Tub; or, the Hi&s;tory of Robert Powe$ the Puppet-&s;how-man;" (under which character Archbi&s;hop Sharp$ was &s;atir$ed.) He wrote al&s;o many political pamphlets again&s;t the la&s;t mini&s;try of Queen Anne, for one of which he was taken into cu&s;tody by a me&s;&s;enger. He was bred to the law; but wrote many other <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit</HI> before he cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s tho&s;e &s;everer &s;tudies. One of his &s;allies, when very young, was the following epigram, which was found in his father's epi&s;copal throne in Sarum cathedral;
<Q><L>"A Bi&s;hop &s;its here,</L>
<L>Which may &s;eem very odd,</L>
<L>Who has two thou&s;and neat,</L>
<L>To drink and to eat,</L>
<L>And to give us the Peace of God."</L></Q>
He was the editor of his Father's "Hi&s;tory of his own Times;" and, as an author, was concerned in a weekly paper called "The Grumbler;" but the publication, which induced Mr. Pope to expo&s;e him with &s;everity in the Dun|ciad, (III. 179.) was a trave&s;tie of the fir&s;t book of the Iliad, intituled "Homerides, by Sir Iliad Doggrel," written in con|junction with Mr. Ducket, and printed in 1715. It is recorded of Mr. Burnet, that, in the days of his levity, his father one day &s;eeing him uncommonly grave, a&s;ked what he was meditating?
<Q>&startq;A greater work, replied the &s;on, than your Lord&s;hip's Hi&s;tory of the Reformation.&endq;</Q>
<Q>&startq;What is that, Tom?&endq;</Q>
"My own reformation, my Lord."
<Q>&startq;I &s;hall be heartily glad to &s;ee it, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, but al|mo&s;t de&s;pair of it.&endq;</Q>
It was, however, accompli&s;hed. Being con&s;ul at Li&s;bon when the late Lord Tyrawley was amba&s;&s;a|dor, upon &s;ome di&s;pute between them, in which the merchants took part with the former, happening to employ the &s;ame taylor, he learned what &s;uit, &amp;c. his Lord&s;hip had ordered for a birth-day, and arrayed his &s;ervants in the &s;ame, while he him&s;elf appeared dre&s;&s;ed quite plain. This occa&s;ioned their both being recalled. Mr. Burnet then applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of his profe&s;&s;ion, in which it is needle&s;s to &s;ay his advancement did not exceed his merit. He was appoint|ed king's &s;erjeant, 1740; a judge of the common pleas, 1741; knighted Nov. 23, 1745; and died Jan. 8, 1753. A thin vo|lume of his poems was publi&s;hed in 1777, 4to.&mdash;The following has been related as an in&s;tance of his evenne&s;s of temper. Din|ing at a friend's where the coachman was one of the atten|dants, in lifting a di&s;h he &s;pilt it awkwardly on the Judge's cloaths, who only &s;aid facetiou&s;ly, while he was rubbing down,

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;eus, the valiant &s;on of Aegeus king of Athens, for a long while knew not his father; till travelling into At|t$ea, he by great fortune there di&s;covered him. But &s;oon after, out of a principle of honour, he left the Athenian court to go to Crete, on a dangerous expedition. Minos was king of that place, who&s;e daughter Ariadne at fir&s;t &s;ight fell unhappily in love with the beautiful &s;tranger; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in killing the Minotaur, a mon&s;ter that was inclo&s;ed in the middle of a large labyrinth. It &s;eems &s;he pre&s;ented him with a cloe of thread, by which, after the conque&s;t of the bea&s;t, he guided his &s;teps back through the many windings of the grove. After this &s;ignal &s;er|vice, he promi&s;ed to carry her with him to Athens; but in his pa&s;&s;age home left her on a de&s;ert i&s;land called Dia. She prays all the Gods to avenge her; which they do, by making The&s;eus, when he comes within &s;ight of Attica, forget to give the appointed &s;ignal of &s;ucce&s;s at a di&s;tance, by which means Aegeus, thinking his &s;on dead, threw him|&s;elf into the &s;ea, and peri&s;hed. Ariadne was afterwards carried into Heaven by Bacchus, and made a con&s;tellation.</P>

On the &s;econd of July 1717, he was appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for taking, examining, and &s;tating the debts due to the army. On the &s;econd of April 1724, he was con&s;tituted one of the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury, in which commi&s;&s;ion he continued till the acce&s;&s;ion of his late Maje&s;ty; and was elected one of the knights-companions of the Bath, on the revival of that mo&s;t honourable order, in 1725. On the fir&s;t of June 1728, he was made one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admiralty, wherein he continued till May 11, 1730, when he was again made one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury: and in 1735 was con&s;tituted &s;ecretary at war, and &s;worn of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable privy-council. In July 1739, he was appointed cu&s;tos rotulorum of the county of Car|narvon; in May 1746, one of the joint vice-trea&s;urers of Ireland; and the &s;ame year was one of the committee of the hou&s;e of commons for managing the impeachment again&s;t Lord Lovat; in 1747, he was elected to parliament for Bodmin and Tiverton, but took his &s;eat for the latter. He was al&s;o ranger of Hampton Court. He fir&s;t married Mary, daughter of Samuel Heathcote, of Hackney in the county of Mid|dle&s;ex, E&s;q. from whom he was divorced, without i&s;&s;ue by her, 1724, and enabled, by act of parliament, to marry again. On Sept. 14, 1729, he married, &s;econdly, Anne, daughter and coheir of Thomas Lord Howard of E&s;&s;ingham, by whom he had i&s;&s;ue four &s;ons and &s;ix daughters. He died Augu&s;t 10, 1755, and was &s;ucceeded in title and e&s;tate by his &s;on, Sir George Yonge, the pre&s;ent baronet. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted Roome in writing a ballad opera, called "The Jovial Crew," acted at Drury Lane in 1731; and in his political character, if he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the fir&s;t-rate abilities, he was con&s;idered as an u&s;eful man by Sir Robert Walpole, with whom he was &s;trictly united. The late Lord Che&s;terfield, who &s;eems to have had &s;ome prejudice again&s;t him, repre&s;ents him in a very unfavourable light. In the 273d letter to his &s;on, he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;Sir William Yonge, with not a quarter of your parts, and not a thou&s;andth part of your knowledge, has, by a glibne&s;s of tongue &s;ingly, rai&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the be&s;t employments of the kingdom: he has been lord of the admiralty, lord of the trea&s;ury, &s;ecretary at war. and is now vice-trea&s;urer of Ireland; and all this, with a mo&s;t &s;ullied, not to &s;ay bla&s;ted character.&endq;</Q>
A &s;ong by Sir William is in the "Gentleman's Magazine" for 1736, p. 103; but the &s;ubject renders it improper to be in&s;erted here. Tho&s;e by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Sir William Yonge, in the &s;ixth volume of Mr. Dod&s;ley's Col|lection, are well known. N.</NOTE>, BART. K.B. LL.D. F.R.S.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>A PASTORAL BALLAD.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CHARLES HAMILTON LORD BINNING <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son to the late earl of Haddington, and father of the pre&s;ent earl, and al&s;o of the pre&s;ent counte&s;s Stan$ope. To a fine under&s;tanding, improved by an excellent education, he joined all the engaging qualities of the heart; and, had he lived, would have been an ornament to his country. A ten|der con&s;titution threw him into an early lingering decay, and the &s;ame di&s;temper that robbed England of her Shafte&s;|bury, deprived her &s;i&s;ter nation of her Binning, and at the &s;ame place. He died at Naples, Jan. 25, 1732-3, regretted by all who knew him, near the tomb of that Roman poet who&s;e writings he &s;o highly admired, and who&s;e manners he &s;o nearly copied, leaving his father not long to &s;urvive his lo&s;s.

<Q><L>TWO Peters, one a Saint, and one a Sinner,</L>
<L>Ador'd his Saviour that, and this his dinner;</L>
<L>In life an Epicure, in name a Prie&s;t,</L>
<L>His Hell no wine, his Heaven a ven$&s;on-fea&s;t.</L>
<L>But here the world a woeful proof may view,</L>
<L>How fal&s;e Religion works beyond the true;</L>
<L>Ere twice the crowing cock his notes had try'd,</L>
<L>The Saint no le&s;s than thrice his Lord deny'd:</L>
<L>The Sinner, faithful to his God of Wine,</L>
<L>For&s;akes not &s;o his more frequented &s;hrine,</L>
<L>Though thrice the midnight cock repeats his warning,</L>
<L>And thrice the watchman's voice proclaims the morning. N.</L></Q></NOTE>.</HEAD>

Hearing this, the &s;$n, who was then a young man of &s;pirit, lo&s;t come from his travels, called at the painter's to &s;ee this picture, and, among the re&s;t, a&s;king the <HI>Ciceroni</HI> whether that odd figure was intended for any particular per&s;on, on his replying that it was generally thought to be very like one Sir I&s;aac Shard, he immediately drew his &s;word and &s;la&s;hed the canva&s;s. Hogarth appeared in&s;tantly, in great wrath; to whom Mr. Shard calmly ju&s;tified what he had done, &s;ay|ing that this was a very unwarrantable licence; that he was the injured party's &s;on, and that he was ready to defend any &s;uit at law &mdash; which however was never in&s;tituted.

<HEAD>THE VISION OF PATIENCE, AN ALLEGORICAL POEM, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MR. ALEXANDER CUMING <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. A. Cuming was fir&s;t &s;upercargo of the Suecia, a Swedi&s;h Ea&s;t India &s;hip, which was wrecked on a rock about two miles E. of the i&s;land of North Ronal&s;ha, the nor|thermo&s;t of the Orkney i&s;lands, Nov. 18, 1740. Immedi|ately on the &s;hip's &s;triking, Mr. Cuming went off in the barge, accompanied by the &s;urgeon and &s;ix of the bolde&s;t &s;eamen, in order to di&s;cover what the i&s;land was, but were never more heard of. Thirty-one of the &s;ailors were &s;aved out of 100, the &s;hip's compliment.

N.</NOTE>, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN UNFORTUNATELY LOST IN THE NORTHERN OCEAN ON HIS RETURN FROM CHINA, 1740.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. S. BOYSE <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For an account of this ingenious writer, the reader is referred to the IId volume of this collection, p. 163; and to vol. VIII. p. 288, 289. I will now add an extract from an original letter which in July 1741 he &s;ent to a friend, with &s;ome citations from his poem called "Deity."&mdash;"I have no great rea&s;on to brag of the &s;ucce&s;s of the poem, though "The Champion" early recommended it. Divine poetry is not the ta&s;te of the age, but I hope it &s;hall be the &s;upport of mine. It is the only &s;ubject I now take plea&s;ure in. I have all la&s;t &s;ummer been employed by Mr. Cave in French tran|&s;lation, a province highly agreeable to me, and the mo&s;t pro|fitable bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tirring. I have been &s;ince la&s;t September al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly with Dr. Douglas in the &s;lavi&s;h work of in|dex-making, alias word-catching: and am only now interrupt|ed by his "O&s;teology," which takes up his whole attention, and will &s;oon be publi&s;hed; the plates, which are the noble&s;t of the kind I ever &s;aw, being taken from the life. I have the pro&s;pect of having a new tran&s;lation from the French in a few days; but Book&s;ellers are &s;o undi&s;tingui&s;hing, and Au|thors, or rather Scriblers, &s;o plenty, that Learning, unle&s;s &s;up|ported, bids fair to &s;tarve between them. I hope the be&s;t, as I begin to be a little known, and would endeavour, as far as I could, to &s;upport a good character in the literary way. &mdash;All I am &s;orry for, is, that the ta&s;te runs &s;trong again&s;t every thing that is ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible&mdash;unle&s;s it is con&s;ecrated by the infallibility of a Pope, who&s;e <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> is as much revered as that of his Holine&s;s at Rome."&mdash;To the &s;ame gen|tleman, in June 1747, he affectingly laments the lo&s;s of his fir&s;t wife Emilia, and de&s;cribes his &s;ituation as "not whol|ly uncomfortable." He was then at Reading, and employed by Mr. Henry in compiling "An Hi&s;torical Review of the Tran&s;actions of Europe." &mdash; "My &s;alary," he &s;ays, "is wretchedly &s;mall (half a guinea a week) both for writing the hi&s;tory and correcting the pre&s;s; but, I ble&s;s God, I enjoy a greater degree of health than I have known for many years, and a &s;erene melancholy, which I prefer to the mo&s;t poignant &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure I ever knew.&mdash;All I &s;igh for, is a &s;ettlement with &s;ome degree of independence, for my la&s;t &s;tage of life, that I may have the comfort of my poor dear girl to be near me, and clo&s;e my eyes. I &s;hould be glad to know if you have &s;een my <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>, from which you mu&s;t not expect great things, as I have been overper&s;uaded to put my name to a compo&s;ure, for which we ought to have had at lea&s;t more time and better materials, and from which I have neither profit nor reputation to expect. I am now beginning 'The Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion,'. a very difficult and invidious ta&s;k. All the accounts I have yet &s;een are either defective, confu&s;ed, or heavy. I think my&s;elf, from my long re&s;idence in Scotland, not unqualified for the attempt, but I apprehend it is premature; and, by waiting a year or two, better materials would offer. Some account, I think, will probably be pub|li&s;hed abroad, and give us light into many things we are now at a lo&s;s to account for. I am about a tran&s;lation (at my lei&s;ure hours) of an invaluable French work, intituled, 'L' H$&s;toire Univer&s;elle,' by the late M Bo&s;&s;uet, Bi&s;hop of Meaux, and preceptor to the Dauphin&punc; elde&s;t &s;on of Lewis XIV. I propo&s;e only to give his Di&s;&s;ertations on the An|cient Empires, viz. the Egyptian, A&s;&s;yrian, Grecian, and Roman, which he has de&s;cribed with &s;urpri&s;ing conci&s;ene&s;s, and with equal judgement and beauty. I de&s;ign to in&s;cribe it to the Right Honourable Mr. Lyttelton, one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, one of the mo&s;t amiable men I have ever known, and to who&s;e uncommon goodne&s;s if you knew my obligations, you would e&s;teem him as much as he de&s;erves."</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>EPISTLE TO HENRY BROOKE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In 1738," &s;ays the gentleman to whom I am obliged for this poem, "Mr. Boy&s;e did me a real favour by intro|ducing me to the acquaintance of the amiable and ingenious. Mr. Brooke, the author of 'Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a.' I vi&s;ited Mr. Brooke almo&s;t every day while he was compo&s;ing that tra|gedy; I peru&s;ed it, &s;cene by &s;cene, as it was written. On that account perhaps, and the e&s;teem which I bear to the author, I may be bia&s;&s;ed in its favour; but I do not think that a tragedy of equal merit has appeared &s;ince that time. I have now by me the four fir&s;t acts of it in manu&s;cript, given me by the author, before the fifth was fini&s;hed. During our ac|quaintance, poor Boy&s;e, by his irregularities, &s;omehow gave offence to Mr. Brooke, who for a time declined his vi&s;its. Boy&s;e, &s;en&s;ible of his fault, (for no man's repentance was more poignant for the time, but, alas! it was brief and fleeting) addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Brooke this penitentiary epi&s;tle, which, with a &s;olemn promi&s;e of amendment, re&s;tored him to favour. &mdash;Boy&s;e was a man of no party: whatever were his private &s;en|timents, his public political creed was influenced by his ne|ce&s;&s;ities. In regard to his per&s;on, he was of a middle &s;ize, of a thin habit, &s;lovenly in his dre&s;s, which was increa&s;ed by his nece&s;&s;ities, very near-&s;ighted, and his hearing imper|fect; the&s;e circum&s;tances, added to his natural diffidence, and his not having been accu&s;tomed to appear in good com|pany but as nece&s;&s;itous, and a mendicant, gave him an awk|ward &s;heepi&s;h air, which by no means prejudiced &s;trangers in his favour. His liberal tran&s;lation of Voltaire's three epi&s;tles on Happine&s;s, Freedom of Will, and Envy, are well execu|ted. They were publi&s;hed, without his name, in the year 1738; but I am a good witne&s;s they were written by him; for, when fini&s;hed, as his cloaths were then depo&s;ited at the pawn|broker's, I treated with the late Mr. Dod&s;ley for the manu|&s;cript, of whom I could only obtain a poor two guineas." The &s;heets were &s;ent to me from the pre&s;s for correction." C.</NOTE>, ESQ.</HEAD>

<P>VOL. V. p. 302. "Dr. Brady attempted in blank ver&s;e a tran&s;la|tion of the Eneid, which, when dragged into the world, did not live long enough to cry. I have never &s;een it; but that &s;uch a ver&s;ion there is, or has been, perhaps &s;ome old catalogue informed me.&mdash;With not much better &s;ucce&s;s, Trapp, when his Tragedy and his Prelections had given him reputation, attempted another blank ver&s;ion of the Eneid; to which, notwith&s;tanding the &s;light regard with which it was treated, he had afterwards per&s;everance enough to add the Eclogues and Georgies. His book may continue its exi&s;tence as long as it is the clande&s;tine refuge of &s;choolboys." DR. JOHNSON.</P>
<P>VOL. VI. p. 82. Since the account of Mr. Hardinge was printed, his &s;on has obliged the learned world with a curious little volume of his father's "Latin Ver&s;es;" among&s;t which is a corrected copy of the Ode in p. 85 of <HI>this</HI> volume. It was written at Knowle Hill in 1739, and addre&s;&s;ed

Mr. Hardinge, it is &s;aid, tran&s;lated this Ode, and at the &s;ame time engaged Dr. Davies to make another tran&s;la|tion. Both are pre&s;erved, and printed in a volume of Eng|li&s;h ver&s;es which I have not had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing. The Latin poems are of various dates; &s;ome of them &s;chool exerci&s;es at Eton in 1717, 1718; others at Cam|bridge 1719&mdash;1722; a poem on the death of his elde&s;t &s;on, 1746; an epitaph on his father (George Hardinge, M. A.) 1750; one &s;mall poem in 1754; and epi&s;tles to &s;everal of his friends between 1730 and 1750. I mention the&s;e &s;o mi|nutely, as the volume in which they are printed has been circulated only among a few friends.</P>
