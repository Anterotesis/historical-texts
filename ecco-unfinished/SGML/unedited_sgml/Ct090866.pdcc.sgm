<P>YOU always provide the inferior Clergy, your <HI>menial Church Servants,</HI> with a form of prayer to be u&s;ed on the day of national fa&s;ting, but you totally neglect to furni&s;h them with &s;ermons &s;uitable for &s;uch an occa&s;ion.&mdash;Your remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in this particu|lar is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the tenor of your conduct: &mdash; You concur in the appoint|ment of General Fa&s;ts; but, when you wal|low in exce&s;s and riot, alas! you leave your curates, poor &s;ouls, to experience the prac|tical <HI>part of fa&s;ting.</HI> In this you follow the example of your ancient friends the <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI>&mdash; <Q>You bind heavy burdens, and grievous &startq;to be borne, and lay them on men's &s;houl|ders, but you will not move them with one &endq;of your fingers.</Q></P>
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
<P>How often, my Lords, have you &s;quandered more money at <HI>one entertainment,</HI> than two or three curates have for the &s;upport of them|&s;elves and their numerous families for a whole year?&mdash;The reflection would make any per&s;on blu&s;h, except <HI>a modern Bi&s;hop</HI>&mdash;Your con|&s;ciences are now &s;tupified through volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s, but the day is nigh at hand when your titles will not avail, nor your lawn &s;leeves and mitres protect you from the righteous judgment which will be pa&s;&s;ed upon every one. When men will not receive a partial &s;entence or be judged according to their external appear|ance, but where all di&s;tinction of characters will be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Author of the following di&s;cour&s;es, having during the cour&s;e of his life lived at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the <HI>Court</HI> is un|unaccu&s;tomed to flattery; you will therefore excu&s;e his freedom&mdash;The language is plain and unequivocal; but perhaps there is more truth contained in them than if written by an <HI>arch|bi&s;hop.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMONS FOR THE ENSUING FAST-DAY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Eccle&s;iates. x. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wo to the O land! when thy King is a child and thy Princes eat in the morning.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS land in which we live, one would think, has no rea&s;on to be afraid of the fir&s;t part of this heavy wo in the text; for the So|vereign of the Briti&s;h Empire has him&s;elf a nu|merous and beautiful family of children, which in <HI>one</HI> &s;en&s;e clears him of the imputation of being a <HI>child.</HI> With re&s;pect to the latter part of this wo, there may be &s;ome rea&s;on to he&s;itate. The word in the text which &s;ignifies Princes, is not confined in its &s;ignification to Princes of the Blood Royal, but may al&s;o be applied to Chief Men, or the companions of princes,&mdash;or it may
<PB N="2" REF="7">be u&s;ed to &s;ignify Privy Coun&s;ellors, or Mini&s;|ters of State. When per&s;ons of this character mind eating in the morning more the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s of the commonwealth it is truly a woful thing to any nation.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) here &s;ignifies to <HI>be given to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or to behave like children, &mdash;to run to their food before they apply to their bu&s;ine&s;s. The wi&s;e man &s;eems to have had in his view, a King and Princes of like characters, and both re&s;embling children in their conduct and behaviour. The learned have &s;aid &s;ome &s;trange things upon this pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;hall not here tran&s;late.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Cujus rex peur <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> aetate unde rerum imperitus e&s;t &amp; regendi imprudens aliorum ductui obnoxius.

<P>This note which was publi&s;hed an hundred years ago and apwards, is &s;omewhat like the &s;peech of a certain noble Lord, which the Editors of the General Evening Po&s;t &s;aid they did not think eligible to publi&s;h at large. As little is it judged eligible at pre&s;ent, to tran&s;late this note. The &s;ub&s;tance of it is, however, pretty well diffu&s;ed through the di&s;cour&s;e, and the Engli&s;h reader will &s;uffer &s;mall lo&s;s for want of a tran&s;lation.</P></NOTE> But it appears &s;ufficiently
<PB N="3" REF="8">evident that Solomon, under&s;tood in this place, by eating and drinking in the morning, (for the word &s;ignifies both) tho&s;e nocturnal revels where people &s;it up till three or four in the morning, and go to re&s;t when they &s;hould go to bu&s;ine&s;s, and are not fit for employment till mid|day. This is a mo&s;t woful practice for both &s;oul and body; for health and bu&s;ine&s;s, for pu|blic and private affairs. For in the fir&s;t place, it is a prepo&s;teous way of wa&s;ting time, by turning day into night, and wa&s;ting health, in&s;en&s;ibly, by wearing out the animal &s;pirits for want of re&s;t and natural refre&s;hment. For any per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half a grain of human nature, mu&s;t know, that if he is employed as he ought to be through the day, he will be in|clined to re&s;t when night approaches; or if he does not enjoy re&s;t &s;uitably in the night, he will be but very unfit for his employment next day. It is no wonder that their <HI>Excellencies</HI> and <HI>Lord&s;hips,</HI> manage public affairs aukwardly, with &s;uch giddy heads and muddy brains, as they mu&s;t have, when they return from <HI>ma&s;querades, cotteries,</HI> and other &s;uch like places of <HI>dullne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;tupefaction.</HI> How can it be otherwi&s;e? When they eat when they &s;hould &s;leep, and re&s;t and lol in their coaches when they &s;hould be about Bu&s;ine&s;s. But what renders the matter wor&s;e, their natural vigour is exhau&s;ted by living contrary to nature, that they are not able to bear the burden of government upon their &s;houlders. Their &s;en&s;es turn languid,
<PB N="4" REF="9">their &s;pirits, torpid, and their minds &s;tupid:&mdash;and their whole frame li&s;tle&s;s to every thing, ex|cept a repetition of the very &s;ame things, which render them <HI>unfit</HI> for all the active employments of government. How wan are their complexions? how pale their cheeks! how languid ther looks? &mdash;and gorey their eyes?&mdash;Solomon &s;ays, <HI>Who have red eyes? tho&s;e that tarry long at the wine.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, this woful practice di&s;orders the judgment, and inflames the imagination. When the organs of &s;en&s;ation are relaxed through in|temperance, di&s;&s;ipation and want of natural re&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the judgment can be clear, or have that freene&s;s of exerci&s;e that it would have, provided the &s;oul had &s;ound organs to act in, and the animal functions were nouri&s;hed by whole&s;ome &s;upplies of natural and &s;ea&s;onable food and re&s;t.</P>
<P>This woful cour&s;e of life al&s;o inflames the imagination, and pu&s;hes on the whole man to ir|rational and forbidden gratifications.&mdash;Whatever is the cau&s;e, the effect is undeniable, that men under the power of intemperance will pur&s;ue objects that they would be a&s;hamed to approach, provided they were &s;ober and under the govern|ment of rea&s;on. The danger that ari&s;es to a nation when Princes eat in the morning is very great; for when their judgments are blinded and their imaginations inflamed, they are ready to pur&s;ue tho&s;e objects of de&s;ire which fancy &s;ug|ge&s;ts, in&s;tead of tho&s;e which rea&s;on and judg|ment would dictate to &s;ober per&s;ons, and &s;o they either forget national concerns, to pur&s;ue their own fancy, or manage all public concerns ac|cording to imagination, and when whim con|trary to rea&s;on and &s;ound judgment. It is not
<PB N="5" REF="10">to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their lord&s;hips who have gone to bed gorged with high &s;ea&s;oned food and &s;trong drink at four o'clock in the morning, can be well qualified to judge of an expre&s;s from Paris, Madrid, or the We&s;t Indies. For though they may be wi&s;er than other men, (which is even problematical) yet they are not naturally &s;tronger, and mu&s;t have re&s;t and &s;lcep as well as others. And it is plain that their wi&s;dom can be of little &s;ervice to the nation, when they are a&s;leep. It is true, they have &s;e|cretaries that are intended to wait upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s in their ab&s;ence;&mdash;but wicked fame &s;ays, that they al&s;o eat in the morning, and &s;leep as long as their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is another woful thing that happens when Princes and Privy Coun&s;ellors eat in the morning, and that is, that it gives the world rea&s;on to infer, that the Sovereign, though he may be a man in point of age, is but a child in conduct, when he employs &s;uch irregular and &s;lothful &s;ervants to manage the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the empire; for it &s;eldom happens that the fir&s;t and latter part of this wo are &s;eparated. If Great Britain is at this day an exception, it will be an happy circum&s;tance; for by all accounts the ca&s;e is different in other nations, where Kings, Princes, and Privy Coun&s;ellors, pur|&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e. With regard to tho&s;e na|tions where there are no Kings, we can form no argument from them concerning the wi&s;e man's wo; the people in tho&s;e countries pro|bably eat and &s;leep all together.&mdash;But this mu&s;t be accounted a part of their infelicity; for when a nation has mini&s;ters of &s;tate to watch for their intere&s;t, they may all &s;leep as &s;ound and as long as they plea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="11">
<P>When Princes eat in the morning there are the following woful things that generally happen to the community.</P>
<P N="1">1. The manners of the nation are neglected, and a wide door opened for all &s;orts of vice and immorality. The rulers of a nation are ap|pointed not &s;o much to collect the revenue, as to re&s;train vice and immorality and maintain good order.&mdash;Common Exci&s;e Officers may per|form the fir&s;t, but it requires per&s;ons of genius, and true virtue to perform the latter. In re|&s;training of vice, the mo&s;t ea&s;y and the mo&s;t eli|gible method for rulers, and magi&s;trates to hold forth a good example to the people, and &s;hew the inferior ranks of mankind, that virtue has &s;ome real meaning by practi&s;ing it them|&s;elves. It is amazing how the inferior degrees of mankind look up to tho&s;e above them, from the &s;cullion in the kitchen to his Grace's wait|ing &s;ervant. It is no uncommon thing to find all the imitations of high life below &s;tairs, as many of low life above. Men who would de&s;ire to make their duties and influence, &s;erve the good and advantage of &s;ociety, mu&s;t beware of giving bad examples to tho&s;e whom they know are ready to form their conduct upon the pat|terns they give them. It will hardly be found in hi&s;tory, that the common people were wicked and di&s;&s;olute, when tho&s;e of high rank were vir|tuous. In the body politic as in the body na|tural, the mo&s;t dangerous and deadly di&s;tempers proceed from the head. When the children of I&s;rael rebelled again&s;t the Lord in the matter of Korah, they had <HI>Princes</HI> of the congregation for their leaders; and when they committed <HI>whore|dom</HI> at <HI>Shittim,</HI> they had <HI>Zimri the &s;on of Salu, a
<PB N="7" REF="12">Prince of a chief hou&s;e among the Simeonites,</HI> for a leader in this <HI>filthy</HI> and <HI>abominable</HI> practice.</P>
<P>When magi&s;trates and rulers, who are &s;up|po&s;ed to be men of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, and better qualified to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil than the vulgar, commit deeds un|worthy of their characters, and contrary to mo|ral laws, the common ranks of men are ready conclude that there is not much malignity in vice as they were wont to apprehend. They therefore are tempted to pre&s;ume in trying an imitation, and if charged with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing di|vine laws, have the excu&s;e ready, that they on|ly, have done what his Lord&s;hip &s;et them the example to do.</P>
<P>It will never be in the power of any &s;tate to re&s;train vice by penal laws, without adding the force of example and wi&s;e tutorage. Vice and immorality are be&s;t prevented by good educa|tion, and wi&s;e example; and if rulers would have their &s;ubjects to obey laws, they ought to &s;hew them by their example the propriety, and advantage of obeying them. It is the love of ju&s;tice, that will make men dutiful and virtu|ous; the fear of puni&s;hment will make them &s;ervile but not hone&s;t.</P>
<P>If they can once overcome this fear; they will no longer pay any regard to duty.&mdash;And there are many ways of getting the better of <HI>even</HI> the fear of death it&s;elf, which in mo&s;t &s;tates is con&s;idered the highe&s;t puni&s;hment that the laws can inflict. Habits of vice and wickedne&s;s too often produce infidelity and temporary athei&s;m, which make vicious men con&s;ider death as only a deliverance from pre&s;ent pain and unea&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="8" REF="13">Cae&s;ar &s;poke the &s;entiments of more than him&s;elf, when he &s;aid, <HI>that in &s;orrow and wretchedne&s;s death is re&s;t from trouble, and not a puni&s;hment, and that it puts an end to all the evils of mankind.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">In luctu atque mi&s;eriis mortem aerumnarum requiem; non cruciatum e&s;&s;e; eam cuncta mortalium mala di&s;&s;olvere; ultra neque curae neque gaudio locum e&s;&s;e. This no uncom|mon language among even &s;ome modern legi&s;lators who are &s;aid like Solomon's princes to eat in the morning.
<P>Cae&s;aris oratio pro Catalina.</P></NOTE> There is no manner of doubt but that many of tho&s;e cri|minals who &s;uffer the puni&s;hment which the laws have adjudged for their crimes, firmly believe that there is no ju&s;tice in the&s;e laws when they &s;ee them&s;elves dragged to execution for tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions which others commit in an higher de|gree with impunity, and are al&s;o honoured and preferred for committing them. There are few &s;o de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e, as not to perceive that there is as much criminality in robbing a nation of millions, as plundering an individual of a few pounds or &s;hillings, and that &s;heding the blood of thou&s;ands of innocent per&s;ons, is as criminal as taking away the life of one man. How can rulers expect that the &s;ubjects will pay due regard to mercy, judgment and faith, when tho&s;e in the high departments of &s;tate, and the exalted &s;tations of life, commit tho&s;e vices for which they are mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed? Per&s;ons who form the rule of their conduct from the examples of tho&s;e above them, and not from the laws them&s;elves, will never be per&s;waded that they can ju&s;tly de&s;erve puni&s;hment for do|ing what rulers them&s;elves have pointed out to them to do by their example.</P>
<P>It is folly of the mo&s;t extravagant nature, and for which it is not ea&s;y to find a name, for le|gi&s;lators
<PB N="9" REF="14">to imagine, that any laws can be bind|ing upon the con&s;ciences of men that are not immediately founded in ju&s;tice. Ju&s;tice is one of tho&s;e cardinal virtues which the heathens de|clared to be &s;elf-evident, and Cicero who per|haps was a greater man than any in the Briti&s;h &s;enate, con&s;idered ju&s;tice as a thing, concerning which there could be no doubt, or if any doubt aro&s;e the thing ought to be done.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Quo circa bene praecipiunt. qui vetant quidquam agere, quod dubites aequum &s;it an iniquum. Aequitas enim civet ip&s;a per &s;e; dubitatio, cogitationem in&s;inificat injurice.</NOTE> What is not &s;elf-evident in matters of right and wrong ought never to be done; and it can never be &s;elf-evident that little crimlnals &s;hould &s;uffer, and great ones be preferred for their wickedne&s;s. No authority can &s;anctify what is in its own na|ture wrong, nor oblige men to yield obedience to preceipts or laws which are contrary to &s;ta|tutes, already confe&s;&s;ed on all hands to be ju&s;t and righteous.</P>
<P>When the King is a child and Princes eat in the morning, it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee tho&s;e muddy legi&s;lators exagerate modern &s;ta|tutes, and enforce them by the &s;evere&s;t &s;ancti|ons, which are diametrically oppo&s;ite and con|trary to ancient laws, and fundamental in&s;titu|tions. Rulers cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed well qualified to make laws for others when they, under the immediate influence of intemperance, and their &s;en&s;es and under&s;tandings annihilated, and in a real delerium. Princes and Mini&s;ters of State, can but ill advi&s;e for the good of a nation, when they are led tottering from the bagnio to their palaces, and tumble into their couches in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. Supported by &s;uch <HI>tot|tering</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="15">pillars, it is no wonder the <HI>&s;tate &s;taggers,</HI> and the <HI>throne &s;hakes.</HI> The&s;e men it is true have their apologies, but they are not new; Julius Cae&s;ar, as ba&s;e a man as ever di&s;graced govern|ment, made the &s;ame apology more than &s;even|teen hundred years ago,&mdash;intended to colour the actions of a &s;et of men of a &s;imilar cha|racter. <Q>Men of inferior rank, &s;ays he, pa&s;s &startq;their days in ob&s;curity, and when they com|mit any error through pa&s;&s;ion, few ob&s;erve it; their fortune and reputation are alike; but tho&s;e who are employed in high offices of the &s;tate, their conduct is known by all men, whence it comes to pa&s;s, that men in &endq;high &s;tations, enjoy the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of li|berty.</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Qui demi&s;&s;i in ob&s;curam vitam habent, &s;i quid ira|cundia delinquere, pauci &s;ciunt: fama atque fortuna pares &s;unt; qui magna imperio praediti in excel&s;o aetatem agunt eorum facta cuncti mortales novere. Ita in maxuma fortuna, minima licentia e&s;t. Orati pro Catalina.</NOTE></P>
<P>This thread bare apology is not founded in truth; for there are many tran&s;actions of the greate&s;t con&s;equence and importance to the pu|blic that millions know nothing of. How few are acquainted with the revenue of the Secretary at War, or the emoluments of the Secretary of the Navy? Few people know or believe that the perqui&s;ites of the&s;e offices amount to nearly as much money as the whole amount of the late new tax upon hou&s;es. If the emoluments of the Secretary to the navy were 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year be&s;ides the &s;alary, in the days of Sir Harry Vane, which he con&s;cientiou&s;ly gave up to the pu|blic, though he had a patent for life, what mu&s;t the&s;e emoluments amount to now, when
<PB N="11" REF="16">the expence of the Briti&s;h navy is more than ten times the extent that it was at that period. The &s;ecretary then had only four-pence the pound for the money audited, and now the rate is &s;ix-pence. The great financier as his friends call him, appears to be a mere child in the du|ties of his office, for he might have had more than his hou&s;e tax, and po&s;t-hor&s;e revenue ju&s;t at his hand, and the ble&s;&s;ings of the nation for taking of it; whereas all-ends of the earth where there are Engli&s;hmen, cur&s;e him by night and by day. The reduction of the&s;e enormous &s;ums to the &s;tandard of moderation would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the tax upon hou&s;es, which is &s;o grievious to many poor families.</P>
<P>Secondly, When Princes eat in the morning, they devour more in gratifying their lu&s;ts and appetites, than would &s;upply the exigencies of government, and greatly relieve the community. The all devouring pa&s;&s;ions of princes and cour|tiers wa&s;te more trea&s;ure, than the real nece&s;&s;i|ty of the &s;tate, and when they are of the cha|racter to which this <HI>wo</HI> relates, they generally wa&s;te all in doing nothing. The large&s;t &s;ums are not &s;ufficient to &s;upply the va&s;t de&s;ires of their unbounded lu&s;ts; what would &s;upport a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, or even carry on a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> was, is in&s;ufficient to &s;upply the inordi|nate demands of regal luxury, and mini&s;terial di&s;&s;ipation. What things are nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of a &s;tate, are not difficult to be obtain|ed; the &s;uperfluities of rulers require va&s;t &s;ums; the univer&s;e it&s;elf is in&s;ufficient to &s;upply them. The fooli&s;h fopperies that are &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to ornament and dignify government, require larger &s;ums, than the nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ub&s;tantial requi&s;ites that &s;upport its vitals and give energy
<PB N="12" REF="17">to its exertions. Even in time of war there is more expended upon &s;plendour, than upon the requi&s;ites really needful for carrying it on; and the expence of guns, &s;words, ammunition and provi&s;ions are &s;carcely to be compared with the &s;ums wa&s;ted upon the &s;uper&s;luities of general offi|cers, the gains of contractors, the profits of officers of &s;tate, and &s;ecret expences. There is even more money expended in pre&s;&s;ing of one man to &s;erve in our navy, than would be &s;ufficient to enli&s;t three, under good management. But when Princes eat in the morning, their meane&s;t dupes mu&s;t imitate them, and nothing le&s;s can &s;erve them than an expence, equivalent to the lu&s;ts of them all. Under the influence and direction of &s;uch managers, it is not to be expected that a com|munity can pro&s;per either in peace or war. In peace the number of unnece&s;&s;ary offices of &s;tate re|quire an expence equal to an ordinary war e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and in time of war provi&s;ion is not made &s;o much to furni&s;h the army and navy with good men, good officers, and other things nece&s;|&s;ary for carrying it on, as to &s;upply the friends of tho&s;e rulers that eat and drink in the morning, with all things that their appetites require.</P>
<P>It can be for no other rea&s;on that in &s;ome nations in Europe, a great number of half-pay officers, able and willing to &s;erve their country and King, are refu&s;ed, and not called to duty in the time of danger;&mdash;when boys and &s;triplings, ignorant of military &s;ervice, are placed at the head of regi|ments and companies, for the &s;ake of emolu|ment, that in the time of peace, they may riot on the vitals of their country, and idly &s;pend what they never merited. The honour and &s;afety of the nation is not &s;o much the &s;tudy of depraved and di&s;&s;ipated men, as the gratification
<PB N="13" REF="18">of their own appetites, and the &s;upport of tho&s;e that will mini&s;ter to their pride and ambition. They endeavour to &s;upport the la&s;t for the &s;ake of the fir&s;t. In&s;tances of this kind are frequently to be met with in &s;ome parts of the world, where men who are pliable to the will of a mini&s;ter, though unqualified to &s;erve in their profe&s;&s;ion, are preferred to others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t con&s;umate and fini&s;hed accompli&s;hments. This &s;hews that the honour and happine&s;s of the nation are not the chief &s;tudy, nor the real end which they have in view in their ad|mini&s;tration, otherwi&s;e they would prefer the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men to promote the welfare of their coun|try.</P>
<P>When the lu&s;ts and appetites of Princes become ma&s;ters of their under&s;tanding, they al&s;o affect their hearts, and render them callous to virtue and common weal; they feel the force of no objects, &s;o much as tho&s;e that &s;upply the immediate crav|ing of appetites, or that &s;tand in the way of their gratification. Their whole de&s;ire is bent towards the one, and their aver&s;ion again&s;t the other. It was a principle of this &s;ort that inclined the Son of Solomon to reject the coun&s;el of the old men, that were his father's coun&s;ellors, and embrace the coun&s;el of the young men that had been brought up with him&s;elf, and it is abundantly evident, that they gave that prince the advice which he follow|ed, becau&s;e they knew his pa&s;&s;ions and their own inclined after the &s;ame objects. It is manife&s;t that the good of the common weal was neither the &s;tu|dy of the King nor his mini&s;ters. Solomon had his own &s;on in view when he uttered the&s;e words, <HI>Wo to thee, O land, when thy King is a Child! and thy Princes eat in the morning.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable that di&s;&s;ipation and tyranny
<PB N="14" REF="19">have in all ages kept pace with one another, and that when princes were of the complexion referred to by the wi&s;e man, they were always oppre&s;&s;ive and arbitrary. This ob&s;ervation has held good from the age before the flood until this day, and there is no rea&s;on to expect that ever the charm will be broken. One immorality will always make way for another. One rea&s;on why profligacy produces tyranny is, that men create new de&s;ires, by cor|rupting their natural appetites, and from this cor|ruption there flows &s;uch a va&s;t generation, that the world it&s;elf is not able to &s;upply them. From hence it comes to pa&s;s that men are never &s;atisfied with what they have, but gra&s;p at more, and when their own cannot &s;erve them, they covet what be|longs to others.&mdash;And &s;uch is the nature of this propen&s;ity, that if they cannot obtain what they de&s;ire freely, provided they have power, they will take it by force.</P>
<P>There is great danger in all indulgence; what is not agreeable at fir&s;t, will by indulgence become nece&s;&s;ary; and u&s;e, and frequent repetition, will make even the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable things become ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and familiar. The nearer men approach to nature, their appetites will be the fewer, and tho&s;e they have more ea&s;ily &s;atisfied; indulge the natural ones, beyond mea&s;ure, and they will cre|ate more new de&s;ires than the world can &s;atisfy. Would Kings and Princes eat and drink, and be|have as they &s;hould do, little would &s;erve them, and their &s;ubjects would never be oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;But after they have been accu&s;tomed to &s;o much in|dulgence, and have had &s;uch large revenues at their command, it would be a wonder of an un|common nature, if their de&s;ires did not encrea&s;e with their abundance. There is no way to make them virtuous, and temperate, but to reduce them
<PB N="15" REF="20">to the &s;tandard of moderation, and make them re|turn to virtue by the &s;ame path that they proceeded to <HI>ambition, tyranny,</HI> and <HI>dominion.</HI></P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that tyranny and di&s;&s;ipation have always kept pace together; but it mu&s;t be always remembered al&s;o, that the latter is the parent of the former.</P>
<P>The Roman hi&s;torian has in the pu|re&s;t and mo&s;t elegant language, elucidated this ob&s;ervation in the character of the Romans. <Q>&startq;After Carthage, the Rival of Rome was &s;ub|dued, and riches flowed in by &s;ea and land, the good fortune of that people almo&s;t ruin|ed them, and tho&s;e who were capable of en|during the greate&s;t hard&s;hips with ea&s;e, were unable to behave well when they grew rich. The love of money produced the love of power, the&s;e were the materials of all the re&s;t of their evils. Covetou&s;ne&s;s &s;ubverted faith and probity, and other virtues. To indulge the&s;e they gratified pride and cruelty, and turned infidel and venal. Ambition made them fal&s;e, and made them &s;ay one thing and think another. They e&s;timated friend&s;hip and enmi|ty, not according to their nature, but according to what advantage might ari&s;e from them. They put a good face upon the wor&s;t de&s;igns. He adds, after honour and riches were united, glory, power and dominion attended them, vir|tue grew ob&s;olete, and poverty became a re|proach. Integrity was accounted ill-nature. Luxury, avarice and pride &s;prung from riches and corrupted the young men, in con&s;equence of which they profu&s;ely wa&s;ted what was their own, and coveted what belonged to others.

<P>Thirdly, They will not regard nor li&s;ten to the complaints and grievances of the people. They are &s;o intent upon pur&s;uing the objects of their pride and ambition, that they con&s;ider all complaints of the &s;ubjects, as unrea&s;onable clamour factiou&s;ly intended to interrupt their plea&s;ures and gratifications. In all corrupt &s;tates the rulers
<PB N="17" REF="22">generally con&s;ider the complaints of the people as unrea&s;onable;&mdash;and the true rea&s;on and cau&s;e of this is, that through habits of vice and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, their own rea&s;on is &s;o depraved, that they are like tho&s;e rulers mentioned by the prophet, that called good evil and evil good, put light for darkne&s;s and darkne&s;s for light.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah, v. 20.</NOTE> Rea&s;on &s;peaks the &s;ame language in all men, but fal&s;e rea&s;oning differs much from rea&s;on,&mdash;as much as a &s;hadow differs from the &s;ub&s;tance. Rea&s;on, and &s;elf-evident truth are the &s;ame, and all men can perceive it, unle&s;s blinded by prejudice, or when they wilfully &s;hut their eyes through corruption. The human mind has its di&s;ea&s;es as well as the body, which make it perceive objects in an unna|tural light. The lower ranks of men as they generally follow nature more nearly than tho&s;e in high life &s;eldom behave &s;o unrea&s;onably as tho&s;e who call them&s;elves their &s;uperiors; and with regard to objects of common &s;en&s;e, they are full better judges than the others.</P>
<P>They will &s;mile at a man that will tell them there is no heat in fire, nor &s;mell in a ro&s;e, and if he in&s;i&s;t upon it they will account him mad, and give over rea&s;oning with him. And &s;hould any tell them that they are not judges of their own rights and privileges, when they have plain &s;tatutes by which they determined, they con&s;ider them as ill de&s;igning per&s;ons who wanted to impo&s;e on them. They would be ready to tell them, and not without rea&s;on, that if there were any thing in government which they were incapable of un|der&s;tanding,
<PB N="18" REF="23">that they were al&s;o incapable of yielding to it, becau&s;e obedience depends upon knowledge of right, and cannot exi&s;t with|out it.</P>
<P>When rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with di&s;&s;ipation, they are ready to imagine that the whole community are as fooli&s;h as them&s;elves; and for that rea&s;on endeavour to per&s;uade the people that it is faction to oppo&s;e their mea|&s;ures, and trea&s;on to maintain their own rights.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e they will not mini&s;ter to the gratifi|cation of the lu&s;ts and appetites of tho&s;e who want to en&s;lave them, they are called factious and rebellious. It is impo&s;&s;ible that rea&s;on can demand, that government which was in&s;tituted for the good of &s;ociety, &s;hould be made the greate&s;t evil and the heavie&s;t cur&s;e. It could never be the intent of the appointment of go|vernment, that rulers &s;hould have a right to di&s;|po&s;e of more than belonged to the right ad|mini&s;tration thereof. With regard to o&s;tentati|ous &s;plendor, it adds nothing to the dignity of government as a moral in&s;titution; for their is more true dignity in a magi&s;trate executing ju&s;t laws in the home &s;pun manufacture of his own country, than in one &s;upporting unrighteous de|crees, and arbitrary authority, dre&s;&s;ed in ermine, or trimmed in gold.</P>
<P>Mankind are not in general &s;o ignorant, as to &s;uppo&s;e that pageantry and &s;uperfluity, add dignity to government, and they can perceive either the fool or the villain throngh all the gar|ni&s;hing
<PB N="19" REF="24">and trappings of office. Neither the &s;tar nor the garter are &s;o far able to dazzle their eyes, as to hinder them from perceiving the black &s;pots that are underneath them, or, of di&s;cerning the the wolf in &s;heeps cloathing. Rulers fondly imagine that the people are not qualified to di&s;cern the inju&s;tice of refu&s;ing their rea&s;onable reque&s;ts, and for that rea&s;on &s;port them&s;elves with their petitions and remon&s;trances; but in this they di&s;play more their own want of judg|ment than the people do want of &s;en&s;e and un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that princes have not learned from experience and ob&s;ervation, that all unnece&s;&s;ary expence and &s;plendour in govern|ment are only progno&s;tications of the downfall of &s;tates and forerunners of their ruin. The hi&s;tory of the four great monarchies, may &s;erve to in&s;truct all future generations of the folly of pageantry, and the unnece&s;&s;ary expence in the government of nations. Luxury and di&s;&s;ipation has generally produced a de&s;ire of dominion, and made princes neglect paying a ju&s;t regard to the complaints and grievances of their &s;ub|jects; for they have been for the mo&s;t part, fonde&s;t of dominion when they were lea&s;t fit to govern, and near to their downfall.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly a woful thing to a nation, to be obliged to &s;upply the extravagances of men, who in&s;tead of ruling it with wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, &s;pend the &s;ub&s;tance thereof in all the vile arts of corruption and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. And what adds to this wo is, that they charge the people with being licentious, after they have
<PB N="20" REF="25">taken all the pains in their power to make them &s;o.</P>
<P>Yet bad as the people in general may be, they would &s;hudder, at the thoughts of many acts of wickedne&s;s that are committed by their &s;uperiors. The charge of licentiou&s;ne&s;s comes with an ill grace from tho&s;e who are living con&s;tantly in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of both divine and human laws, and have nothing to &s;ave them from puni&s;hment, except the partiality of go|vernment, and the indulgence of divine mercy.</P>
<P>With regard to the charge of faction and rebellion which arbitrary rulers bring again&s;t the people, it may be returned upon them&s;elves, where the&s;e crimes are oftener to be found than among the people. It mu&s;t pro|ceed from their not knowing what is the na|ture of rebellion, that they do not take charge home to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah will help them to under|&s;tand what is properly rebellion. Thy princes are rebellious and the companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after re|wards, they judge not the fatherle&s;s, neither does the cau&s;e of the widow come before them.</P>
<P><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 1.25,</NOTE> From this de&s;cription it is plain that princes may be rebellious, and that when they are the com|panions
<PB N="21" REF="26">of theives they come under that pre|dicament.</P>
<P>There are three things that con&s;titute rebellion according to this de&s;cription.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Joining intere&s;ts and partner&s;hip with theives and di&s;hone&s;t per&s;ons. The&s;e are &s;uch as take what is not their own, and apply it to their own purpo&s;es. This is a cour&s;e compliment to princes, but as it is given by an in&s;pired pro|phet it cannot be taken ami&s;s.</P>
<P>His rebellion again&s;t God and the laws, for rulers to take more than ju&s;tly is due to them or join intere&s;ts with tho&s;e who do &s;o.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o di&s;hone&s;t to promote or procure laws, that may make it legal to give them more than the people can afford; this comes under the notion of theft and rebellion according to the prophet's idea.</P>
<P>The princes of Judah and I&s;rael went part|ners with the &s;overeign in the plunder of the nation. They probably voted large &s;upplies to the King, becau&s;e they knew they would re|ceive a &s;hare of the revenue, and might pro|mote a law for encrea&s;ing the civil li&s;t in hopes of &s;erving in his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold; but this was theft and rebellion again&s;t ju&s;tice, and the laws of the land.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="27">
<P>Tho&s;e who obey the fundamental laws of go|vernment cannot be rebels, though it is mani|fe&s;t that legi&s;lators that make laws contrary to natural ju&s;tice and the law of God may be guilty of rebellion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeking after gifts, and following rewards are joined with rebellion. This probably referred to a vote of credit, which admini&s;tration of Judah pro|cured to an&s;wer the expence of &s;ecret &s;ervice, without any de&s;ign of doing any thing with it for the good of the nation. This is joined with theft and rebellion.</P>
<P>And indeed what can be greater theft than to procure the credit of a nation to rai&s;e money for the &s;ervice thereof, and apply it to private purpo&s;es? Were &s;uch a thing done in Britain, the whole nation would have rea&s;on to cry out again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Not executing the laws impartially is joined with rebellion, or is rather a part of it. The fatherle&s;s and the widow were either ne|glected or made feel all the force of penal laws when they were guilty, when tho&s;e who had influence in a tribe or could &s;erve the ends of admini&s;tration were re&s;cued from ju&s;tice, when they had committed the mo&s;t capital crimes.</P>
<P>This is by the prophet accounted the very
<PB N="23" REF="28">height of rebellion, and is often committed by princes and their companions.</P>
<P>Thus it is plain, that rebellion is not a crime peculiar to the people only, but is al&s;o &s;ome|times to be found at the very &s;prings of go|vernment.</P>
<P>Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion, but the &s;cripture informs us otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>As we are certain from the be&s;t authority that even princes may rebel, the que&s;tion now is, whether they ought to be puni&s;hed for it like other rebels, and who can lawfully puni&s;h them? This que&s;tion requires a little caution, and mu&s;t be determined by &s;cripture; and it is hoped then that no Chri&s;tians will di&s;&s;ent from the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whether there is any difference between try|ing Kings and Princes for rebellion, and pu|ni&s;hing them without trying them, I &s;hall leave to the tories, and ca&s;ui&s;ts to determine. For there has been more noi&s;e concerning the trial of King Charles the Fir&s;t, than concerning the puni&s;hment of all the rebellious Princes &s;ince the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>This Prince is the only Martyr we find a|mong the Kings of England, though many of
<PB N="24" REF="29">them have &s;uffered for their tyranny and rebel|lion again&s;t the laws.</P>
<P>The Kings in this country are con&s;idered as the &s;ource of the laws, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that if the King could die, that all law would be at an end; for this rea&s;on the lawyers have made our Kings immortal, and laid it down as a fir&s;t principle that the King cannot die.</P>
<P>It ought to have been &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered before &s;uch a my&s;terious maxim had been laid down as a fir&s;t principle, whether laws or kings were fir&s;t appointed by the Almighty; for if ever we can find laws without Kings, it will ap|pear manife&s;t that they are not nece&s;&s;ary to the being of government, but that laws may continue when there is no monarch.</P>
<P>It is plain, that there was law before we hear any thing of any ruler except God him&s;elf, from whence it would appear, that the exi&s;t|ence of laws does not depend upon any human regal authority, and though that Kings &s;hould chance to die, the laws if ju&s;t will continue immortal; if they are unju&s;t they ought never to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>But to make this point as plain as po&s;&s;ible, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that all government orginally proceeded from God; and this rule of government is expre&s;&s;ed two ways by the law of nature, and expre&s;s and po&s;itive pre|cepts in the divine word, the&s;e are the two ways by which God &s;peaks to men concerning go|vernment. The execution of this civil government is left to the wi&s;dom of &s;ociety to form.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="30">
<P><GAP DESC="MISSING">it in what &s;hape men plea&s;e, provided they do not proceed contrary to nature or divine po&s;itive laws. All men are &s;uppo&s;ed capable of keeping or tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the laws, from whence ari&s;es rewards and puni&s;hments. But there is no infallible legi&s;la|tor except the Deity; it is he only that can do no wrong. No human authority can rai&s;e an in|dividual in &s;ociety above the laws, or render that individual free from the penalty of them in ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. That a king has no peers, and con&s;equently cannot be tried by his &s;ubjects, is a maxim of human invention; for as he is only a &s;ervant in tru&s;t, if he betray or abu&s;e his tru&s;t, though he may not have peers, he has undoubtedly &s;uperiors, to whom he is accountable in ju&s;tice. The whole community are his &s;uperiors, though individual are his &s;ubjects, when he ob&s;erves the laws. When his &s;uperiors dive&s;t him of his tru&s;t for abu&s;ing it, he becomes then only equal to other individuals, and con&s;equently is <HI>par communitatis,</HI> a peer of the community, and liable to the &s;anction of the laws like others. That community which &s;et up one man to execute the laws, may appoint others to judge him for fundamentally de&s;troying the end of his appointment. If God had created kings before &s;ubjects, or &s;ignified that mankind were made for their behoof, and bound to be &s;uffi|cient to them under all con&s;iderations; in this ca&s;e a monarch could have had no peers, but would have been as ab&s;olute over men, as Adam was over the bea&s;ts. But there is no account of this doctrine in &s;cripture, and rea&s;on can never &s;uppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>That monarchs have been called to account by the people for pro&s;titution of government, with divine approbation, the hi&s;tory of the &s;on of Solo|mon, and of Amaziah, kings of Judah, are &s;uffi|cient proof. The &s;tory of the fir&s;t is recorded
<PB N="26" REF="31">1 Kings xii, and of the latter, 2 Chron. xxv. The crime of the fir&s;t was his refu&s;ing to li&s;ten to the humble petition of his &s;ubjects, when they reque&s;ted to be ea&s;ed of the heavy burdens they groaned un|der; and the crime of the latter was, his corrupt|ing religion and entering into an unju&s;t war with the king of I&s;rael, in which he lo&s;t a va&s;t number of his &s;ubjects, and reduced the nation to great di&s;tre&s;s. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e two princes &s;hews plainly what people may do without di&s;plea&s;ing, or rather what power he has lodged in their hands.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar proverb, that &s;ome people are twice children; this is &s;ometimes the lot of kings, and was the ca&s;e of the &s;on of Solomon, the &s;on of Da|vid. This prince was forty and one years old when he came to the kingdom, and was a child of a pretty competent age; but notwith&s;tanding his number of years, his folly &s;hewed him to be but a child. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate this prince's childhood in a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. He ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to redre&s;s the grievances of his people, and threatened to encrea&s;e them. Though money was plenty in the days of Solomon, the people were poor; gold and &s;ilver were plenty in Jeru&s;alem, and near the king's court, but it does not &s;eem to have circulated as far as Shechem, and the extremities of Pala&s;tine. The real wealth of nations does not con&s;i&s;t in a large quantity of &s;pe|cie, but in a proper balance of the value of money with the price of u&s;eful commodities. Solomon was rich, but his &s;ubjects were poor and oppre&s;&s;ed. The misfortune of Solomon's government, for all the wi&s;dom that he had, was, that he brought more luxuries into the nation, than commodities profita|ble for the &s;ervice of the people. He was al&s;o very extravagant in his hou&s;hold expences, and the
<PB N="27" REF="32">charges of his government. <Q>His provi&s;ion for one &startq;day was thirty mea&s;ures of fine flour, and three|&s;core mea&s;ures of meal; ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pa&s;ture, and an hundred &s;heep, be&s;ide harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. He had al&s;o forty thou&s;and &s;talls for hor&s;es, for chariots, and twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e|men.&endq;</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings iv. 28.</NOTE> This was a mon&s;trous peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. What a dreadful expence mu&s;t this have been to the nation? Under all this &s;hew of wealth and &s;plendour in the king, the people were poor and greatly oppre&s;&s;ed. They therefore came to the new king, to a&s;k a redre&s;s of their grievances, and to have their burdens made lighter. But he an|&s;wered them roughly and would not li&s;ten to their humble petition. <HI>They &s;pake unto him, &s;aying, Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous &s;ervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will &s;erve thee.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xii. 4.</NOTE> There was nothing unrea&s;onable in all this; it was a very mode&s;t reque&s;t, and none except a <HI>child</HI> or a <HI>fool</HI> would have refu&s;ed it.

The com|plaints of the people are not to be trifled with; for if princes will not relieve them, they will them|&s;elves
<PB N="28" REF="33">and the Almighty will help them to do it. It was a mo&s;t childi&s;h action in that weak prince to refu&s;e &s;uch a rea&s;onable petition, which was altoge|ther for his own intere&s;t to grant; for the people promi&s;ed to &s;erve him if he would ea&s;e them a lit|tle; &s;o he might have &s;aved all by little conde&s;cen|&s;ion, which he lo&s;t through willfulne&s;s and ob&s;ti|nacy. What can princes imagine the people are made of, when they treat them &s;o ridiculou&s;ly? They mu&s;t &s;urely think that they are not creatures of like pa&s;&s;ions with them&s;elves, otherwi&s;e they would &s;oon conclude that they would not &s;uffer the treatment which they often gave them.</P>
<P N="2">II. This prince refu&s;ed the advice of his father's aged and wi&s;e coun&s;ellors. <HI>They &s;pake unto him, &s;aying, if thou will be a &s;ervant to this people, and wilt &s;erve them, then will they be thy &s;ervants for ever.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xii. 7.</NOTE> They de&s;erved every one a pen&s;ion for this advice; but &s;uch words of wi&s;dom &s;eldom meet with acceptance or preferment from childi&s;h princes. The&s;e old &s;ages knew the office and duty of a king. It is only that of a <HI>public &s;ervant</HI> to the community, by fulfilling of which, they &s;ecure the love and obedience of their &s;ubjects for ever, which is the be&s;t &s;ecurity. This wi&s;e coun&s;el did did not &s;uit the humour of this <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and <HI>childi&s;h</HI> prince. The word <HI>&s;ervant</HI> founded har&s;h in his de&s;potic ears&mdash;A king to be a &s;ervant! How un|courtly the thought! how unroyal the idea! The&s;e coun&s;ellors could not expect to continue long in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; they were far too hone&s;t and free in their advice, to &s;uit the cabinet of a <HI>childi&s;h</HI> and <HI>ob&s;tinate</HI> &s;overeign. They, however, di&s;charged their duty, and gave the be&s;t proofs of their regard and love to their prince and their
<PB N="29" REF="34">country. The&s;e old men knew the &s;tate of the na|tion, and were well per&s;uaded that the people would not long &s;uffer the oppre&s;&s;ions they were groaning under; they under&s;tood that many things had been now warped into government that were contrary to the con&s;titution of the kingdom. The law &s;aid, <HI>that the king &s;hould not multiply hor&s;es, nor make the people return to Egypt for that purpo&s;e, neither was he to multiply to him&s;elf &s;ilver and gold.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">deut. xvii. 16.17.</NOTE> Solomon had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in all the&s;e re&s;pects, and more than all, he had been guilty of Idolatry, and had not walked in the &s;tatutes of God, like David his father. The&s;e were all flagrant breaches of the con&s;titution, which the old men knew were unwarrantable, and that the Lord would not &s;uffer to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed if they were per&s;i&s;ted in. They al&s;o knew that the people's claims were ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and ought to have been complied with, and for the&s;e rea&s;ons gave him whole&s;ome coun&s;el, which a wi&s;e prince would have received with thankfulne&s;s, and re|warded with honour. But this childi&s;h prince was fonder of the gewgaws of maje&s;ty and &s;tate, than the dignity of real government; and choo&s;e rather to imitate the <HI>&s;ins</HI> and <HI>follies</HI> of his father's reign, than covet his wi&s;dom, wherein he was worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more fooli&s;h and weak, than to violate the fundamental laws of government. It was a fundamental law of the land, that the king &s;hould not have his heart lifted up above his bre|thren; for if this &s;hould happen, he nor his chil|dren were to prolong their days in the kingdom. Yet this he regarded nothing, but for the &s;ake of unju&s;t dominion, lo&s;t the ten parts out of twelve of his whole dominions.</P>

<P N="3">III. It was childi&s;h, to turn away men of age and experience, and to choo&s;e young coun&s;ellors who knew but little, and were on that account more ready to be ra&s;h and head&s;trong. He however ad|vi&s;ed with the young men that had grown up with him&s;elf, who gave him coun&s;el according to his own inclination. Perhaps &s;ome of them had been his <HI>tutors,</HI> and had taught him tho&s;e principles of government, which they wi&s;hed to &s;ee put in prac|tice, now when he was come to the throne. Their principles are manife&s;t from the advice which they gave their &s;overeign. <HI>And they &s;aid unto him, thus &s;halt thou &s;peak unto this people that &s;pake unto thee &s;aying, thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us: thus &s;halt thou &s;ay unto them, my little finger &s;hall be heavier than my father's loins, and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke, my father did cha&s;ti&s;e you with whips, but I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with &s;corpions.</HI>* This &s;peech like many other &s;peeches that are made for kings, this childi&s;h prince was &s;o fooli&s;h as to deli|ver to the people, which made them change their petition into a remon&s;trance, which he did not &s;oon forget. <HI>The people an&s;wered the king and &s;aid, what portion have we in David? Neither have we inheri|tance in the &s;on of e&s;&s;e: to your tents, O I&s;rael! now &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e David.</HI> It is the greate&s;t folly in the world for kings to drive their &s;ubjects to de|&s;pair; there is none can tell what a people will do when once they are awakened. All families are alike to them when their own natural rights and pri|vileges are come in competition.</P>
<P>Whatever rea&s;ons Rehoboam might give for pre|ferring the&s;e ra&s;h coun&s;ellors in&s;tead of the old &s;ages who give &s;alutary advice, they certainly had their<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 King xii. 10.</NOTE>
<PB N="31" REF="36">foundation in weakne&s;s and childi&s;hne&s;s. He might probably alledge that he had a right to choo&s;e his own &s;ervants and prefer his particular friends; this is a common argument with &s;overeigns, when they are challenged on this head. But they ought to con&s;ider, that the government of a nation is very different from the government of an hou&s;hold, or the management of dome&s;tic affairs. Though a king has a right to choo&s;e his own &s;ervants, yet the&s;e &s;ervants have no right to ruin a whole nation to plea&s;e one man. A prince may appoint whom he plea&s;es to manage the affairs of his own hou&s;e with|out con&s;ulting the nation concerning his conduct; but what relates to the public is quite different; the &s;overeign and all his &s;ervants, are accountable to the community for the management of public affairs; for there can be no authority with uncon|troulable power to ruin mankind, lodged in any de|partment of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It was a childi&s;h action in the &s;on of Solo|mon, after the ten tribes had declared them&s;elves in|dependent, to employ a man to bring about a recon|ciliation who had had a chief hand in driving them to a revolt. <HI>Then king Rehoboam &s;ent Adoram, who was over the tribute, and all I&s;rael &s;toned him with &s;tones till he died.</HI>* Many differences might ea&s;ily be made up, provided wi&s;e men were employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s; but when a difference is fomented by folly, it will never be in the power of fools to remedy it. Had &s;ome of the men, who gave the king the wi&s;e coun&s;el, been employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, it is proba|ble it might have &s;ucceeded; their words would have weight with the people; but to employ the very Judas that kept the bag that &s;wallowed the trea&s;ure of the nation, was the mo&s;t childi&s;h &s;cheme that<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 King xii. Ver&s;e 18.</NOTE>
<PB N="32" REF="37">could have been devi&s;ed. Their very blood began to boil at the &s;ight of him, and they gave him ju&s;tice in a &s;ummary manner. His ma&s;ter was much to blame in employing him, and &s;hewed him&s;elf a mere child in the knowledge of mankind, as well as totally deficient of all powers to govern a king|dom. It was a &s;ad affair for a fir&s;t lord of the trea|&s;ury to be pelted to death with &s;tones like a dog; he de&s;erved perhaps all he met with, but it was a butcherly way of putting him to death. Not to give a poor &s;inner time to &s;ay Lord have mercy on him was a dreadful affair. But what can &s;uch men expect when the people are &s;o terribly provoked with their wicked and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures. Had he been beheaded it would have come much to the &s;ame thing; for it was his life they wanted, and either way would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e. The greate&s;t folly was in &s;ending him upon &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion, where there was not the &s;malle&s;t probability that ever he would &s;ucceed. It was as improbable that Adoram could bring about a reconciliation between Judah and the ten tribes, as it was that our com|mi&s;&s;ioners could have effected one between Great Britain and the colonies. It would have required wi&s;e men, and good men, to have performed a work of this kind. It was out of the power of pen&s;ioners, or friends of the court of either kings to do it.</P>
<P>What aggravated the childi&s;hne&s;s of this king was, that after his fooli&s;h &s;cheme of involuntary reconci|liation was fru&s;trated, he determined to take ven|geance on the revolted tribes, by levying war upon them, and intended to have added blood-&s;hed to op|pre&s;&s;ion. After he came to Jeru&s;alem, he a&s;&s;embled all the hou&s;e of Judah and Benjamin, an hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and cho&s;en men which were warriors, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam the &s;on of Solomon. They were no doubt all good men and
<PB N="33" REF="38">true to the cau&s;e of their ma&s;ter; per&s;ons of war|like intrepidity, mighty men of valour, men of known character in martial exploits. There is no doubt but &s;ome of them might have been in the armies of king David, and had been at the &s;ack|ing of &s;everal cities, and vanqui&s;hed many armies. They would therefore account it an ea&s;y matter to &s;ubdue a rebellious rabble of traiterous revolt|ers, untrained to war, and at pre&s;ent under no di&s;cipline. The young men, who&s;e coun&s;els had cau&s;ed the revolt, would be ready to &s;upport their own mea&s;ures, and to per&s;uade his maje&s;ty, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t his arms; that a mean rebel|lious mob, would never &s;tand before the king's re|gular troops, but would flee or lay down their arms at the &s;ight of his &s;tandard. Kings in the <HI>&s;econd in|fancy</HI> of their nature, are willing to believe &s;uch flattering &s;tories, e&s;pecially when their hearts are bent upon a project to which they relate. And had not the Almighty interpo&s;ed his authori$y, this child of a king would have tried an experiment that might have co&s;t him the whole of his dominions and his life into the bargain. The only thing that is wonderful in his whole character is, that he &s;hould have paid any regard to the divine authority, or have li&s;tened to the prophet that was &s;ent to him. One would have thought that he would have appointed a fa&s;t, and tried what influence he had with heaven, and prayed for <HI>&s;trength to re&s;i&s;t</HI> the rebellious tribes. Child as he was, he kept clear of this folly, and kept what he had, rather than ri&s;k all, by in&s;ulting the Deity. In our times the words of the prophets pa&s;s for wind; for though they &s;peak as plainly now as in tho&s;e days, their words are not regarded, but are con&s;idered as old progno&s;tications, who&s;e times are elap&s;ed, and them&s;elves out of date. Thus in the character of the &s;on of Solomon we have a mir|ror, in which we may &s;ee the complexion of the &s;e|cond
<PB N="34" REF="39">infancy of princes, and the childhood of kings; we may al&s;o perceive how woeful a thing it is to a nation to be governed by a weak and ob&s;tinate prince, and how thankful we in the&s;e lands &s;hould be that it is not our lot to fall under this di&s;mal woe.&mdash;But I conclude.</P>

<P>THERE is a va&s;t of mimickry in &s;ome people's religion; it would be happy for them if they had more &s;incerity and le&s;s &s;plendor. Above all things it is the mo&s;t ab&s;urd to act a face before God; for there is neither prai&s;e nor profit can attend it, and there is a &s;ad account to be given for the part that is acted. It is a great pity but &s;uch actors were hi&s;&s;ed off the &s;tage now, as they will be when the grand drama is fini&s;hed, and the curtains withdrawn. Fa&s;ting is an act of mortification which but few great men are acquainted with; and it is much to be que&s;tioned if our two metropolitans know much about it. Some of the curates would be better qualified to compo&s;e a form of prayer for a fa&s;t day; men who are accu&s;|tomed to devour many thou&s;ands a year, know but little concerning fa&s;ting. Many of the inferior clergy know from experience the nature of this ap|pointment, and are acquainted with the practical part of the duty; the form of prayer &s;hould have been a&s;&s;igned to them to compo&s;e. The bi&s;hops, deans, prebendaries, and rectors, ought to have been excu&s;ed till &s;ome remarkable fe&s;tivity was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and then they would have been the mo&s;t proper ma&s;ters of the ceremonies. Fa&s;ting is a very &s;erious affair, and requires a very mortified temper
<PB N="36" REF="41">of mind. And what is more, it mu&s;t be neither more nor le&s;s than what the Lord hath cho&s;en. There is &s;omething whim&s;ical in a man driving in a coach to the hou&s;e of God, and fa&s;ting only the time of divine &s;ervice, and galloping home to turtle and good wine in the afternoon. Fa&s;ting is now become a comedy, intended as a prologue, to tra|gedy, wherein men endeavour to plea&s;e God with a farce, that he may give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to plea&s;e them&s;elves with &s;hedding human blood in acting the deepe&s;t tragedy. The repetition of our modern national fa&s;ting is neither more nor le&s;s, than the challenge which the Jews gave the Almighty in the third ver&s;e of this chapter; <HI>wherefore have we fa&s;ted and thou &s;ee&s;t it not?</HI> Wherefore ha&s;t thou not, O Lord, &s;uffered us to kill all the coloni&s;ts five years ago? we fa&s;ted thrice before for this purpo&s;e, and thou regarded it not. We think it very &s;trange that thou ha&s;t not permitted us to &s;wallow up and devour the&s;e rebels, according to our reque&s;ts which we de|votely offered up the&s;e three times.</P>
<P>The Almighty gives his rea&s;ons why he did not regard the fa&s;ting of the Jews, and it may &s;erve as a rea&s;on why he has not regarded our national fa&s;t|ing. <HI>Ye fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s.</HI> This is a fa&s;t which the Lord has not cho&s;en, and to which he will pay no merci|ful regard. I &s;hall very &s;hortly con&s;ider a fa&s;t which the Lord hath cho&s;en:</P>
<P N="1">I. It con&s;i&s;ts in loo&s;ing the bands of wickedne&s;s; in repealing the &s;anguinary laws that have been made to oppre&s;s and kill our brethren in America. They may perhaps be rebels, but what are we? or what were we when Chri&s;t died for the ungodly? It is well known that there were no laws in exi&s;tence that could make them rebels a few years ago; they
<PB N="37" REF="42">were only created &s;uch, by the modern omnipotence of parliament. And can we imagine that a merci|ful and gracious God will regulate his conduct, according to the plea&s;ure of men who are more re|gulated by private intere&s;t and ambition, than ju&s;tice and faith?</P>
<P>By bands of wickedne&s;s the prophet under&s;tands unrighteous decrees made by modern authority, contrary to ancient con&s;titutional laws of the Jewi&s;h nation, given to I&s;rael by the hand of Mo&s;es. The laws which God gave to the Jews upon mount Ho|reb, &s;ecured the ju&s;t rights and privileges of all ranks, and no authority of any judge or judges, &s;anhedrim or council, could lawfully incroach upon a &s;ingle privilege of the meane&s;t of the people. In the progre&s;s of time things were altered, and man|ners, mea&s;ures, and laws were changed; for though the ancient code of laws, and rules of government which God had given them by Mo&s;es, were &s;till the profe&s;&s;ed &s;tatutes of the nation, and went by the name of the con&s;titutional laws of the realm, yet tho&s;e &s;tatutes were perverted by modern acts of power which were diametrically oppo&s;ite thereto, and determined by the government to have as much force as the ancient in&s;titutions of Mo&s;es. The Jews were at this time much in the &s;ame &s;ituation that the people of this i&s;land are in at this day; they boa&s;ted of their privileges, while they perverted them; and when they made u&s;e of power to oppre&s;s, they produced laws for &s;o doing. The rulers had made their government a jarring &s;y&s;tem of oppo&s;ite principles. <HI>Non bene junctarum di&s;|cordia &s;emina rerum.</HI> The modern acts of the le|gi&s;lature, were contrary to the con&s;titution, but were at the &s;ame time inforced with as powerful &s;anctions, and executed with more rigour. While mercy, judgment and faith lay neglected, &s;tatutes of
<PB N="38" REF="43">oppre&s;&s;ion were inforced with all the energy that go|vernment was capable of. Swearing, lying, and committing adultery were winked at, while the laws concerning tythes were rigorou&s;ly executed. A man might defile his neighbour's bed, &s;educe his daugh|ter with impunity, but if he failed in paying tythes or of bearing his &s;hare of taxes he was mo&s;t rigour|ou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Ho&s;ea, who lived at the time with the Prophet I&s;aiah, informs us how relaxed this people were in points of ju&s;tice and morality, even when they were rigorous in things of very &s;mall con&s;equence.&mdash; <Q>&s;tartq;They make the King glad with their wickedne&s;s, and the Princes with their lies.

They were partial in the law; that is, they paid more regard to the new acts of State, than the Old Statutes of the Con&s;titution which were appointed by the Al|mighty. This appears to be our ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. A man will be pro&s;ecuted with rigour for killing a hare, or &s;uffering a dog to follow him, when he will be permitted to tran&s;gre&s;s the moral law with impunity. I appeal to our Magi&s;trates, whether they are as zea|lous in putting the laws in execution again&s;t open
<PB N="39" REF="44">profaners of the Sabbath day, as they are in execut|ing them again&s;t poachers, and per&s;ons that are not judged qualified to kill a hare or a partridge? The &s;tatutes which are again&s;t immorality, and vice, are &s;tanding in our law books, as &s;o many dead acts, while modern &s;tatutes, and uncon&s;titutional decrees, are quickened with the utmo&s;t energy of power, and executed with the iron hand of rigour. Is the &s;ame regard paid to Magna Charta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights, and the Union Settlement be|tween the two nations, that is paid to the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, the Re&s;training Act, and the Canada Popi&s;h law? If our ancient &s;tatutes are founded in ju&s;tice, the&s;e modern laws are undoubtedly &s;ubver&s;ive both of ju&s;tice and equity. No man can prove that both are righteous decrees, unle&s;s he can prove contradic|tions to be true, and things oppo&s;ite in their nature to be the &s;ame. Such incon&s;i&s;tent &s;tatutes are by this Prophet called unrighteous decrees. "Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and write grievou&s;ne&s;s which they have pre&s;cribed. To turn away the needy from judgment, and to take the right from the poor of my people; that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherle&s;s."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah x. 1.</NOTE> Such bands of wickedne&s;s mu&s;t be loo&s;ed before &s;uch as made them can ob&s;erve a fa&s;t acceptably to the Lord; for till this is done, their fa&s;t will want one e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of a fa&s;t that the Lord hath cho&s;en. While the rulers of a nation are inforcing daily, arbitrary acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, it is abundantly daring in them to pretend to keep a fa&s;t to the Lord.

<P>The de&s;ign of the fa&s;t now appointed, is to ad|dre&s;s the God of mercy for aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration in carrying on, what is called a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> war, again&s;t our enemies. Among the&s;e enemies the American colonies are included. The ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of this part of the war, is very doubtful, and the other parts of it do not at all ap|pear nece&s;&s;ary. Till the fir&s;t part of it had been proved to be ju&s;t, it was &s;oon enough to have deter|mined any of its departments nece&s;&s;ary; for what is not ju&s;t can never be nece&s;&s;ary. Be&s;ides, what is doubtful ought not to be a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for war. The ju&s;tice of the laws upon which this war proceeds ought to be &s;elf evident: for blood ought never be &s;hed but when guilt is as clear as a &s;unbeam. The objects of one department of this war refu&s;e the charge of rebellion, and they appeal to the funda|mental laws of the empire, whether their claims are not the &s;ame with tho&s;e that their fathers and the whole Briti&s;h nation in&s;i&s;ted upon at the revolution, and have &s;ecured to them by the laws of the land. They &s;ay, they do not re&s;i&s;t the laws, nor refu&s;e to obey the Sovereign, but re&s;i&s;t the violence of an ad|mini&s;tration, that has di&s;graced the con&s;titution by procuring oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tatutes. If the&s;e modern &s;ta|tutes are contrary to the whole&s;ome con&s;titution of England, they ought to be repealed before the fa&s;t, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a fa&s;t for carrying on a war to &s;et a&s;ide all that the mercy of Providence wrought for this nation at the glorious re|volution. But &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e laws are doubtful, and have been framed by <HI>ra&s;h</HI> and <HI>adventurous</HI> men
<PB N="41" REF="46">in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion and oppo&s;ition, they ought not to be rea&s;ons of war and de&s;olation. Nothing pro|blematical ought to be rea&s;ons of war; and that the grounds of the American war are doubtful is mani|fe&s;t, becau&s;e the nation is divided concerning them, and the greate&s;t number of individuals have always been again&s;t it. In a doubtful ca&s;e a nation has no ju&s;t right to go to war, but they have &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to a&s;k the Lord to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; for there is no faith in &s;uch a doubtful proceeding, and what&s;oever is not faith is &s;in. Men that are &s;trongly inclined from principles of prejudice and worldly intere&s;t, may at|tempt to trim this &s;ubject, according to their wi&s;hes, in the be&s;t manner they can; but after all is done, their arguments will be like the lamps of the fooli&s;h virgins mentioned in the go&s;pel&mdash;<HI>dark for want of oil to give them light.</HI></P>
<P>The promoters of this fa&s;t, and the ruinous war it is intended to &s;upport, would have behaved with more propriety had they a&s;ked coun&s;el of the lord before they began this war that now is &s;o heavy upon their hands. But there is &s;trong rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that they began without con&s;ulting the will of God; and that this hypocritical fa&s;t will have no other effect, than to aggravate their guilt and iniquity. They have tried two experiments already without &s;ucce&s;s, and without reforming one fal&s;e &s;tep they have taken, there is little to hope that without reformation that ever the Almighty will re|gard our fa&s;ting. It is a &s;trange fancy that prevails in this nation, that our rulers always begin war without con&s;ulting God; and &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves perfect judges of the lawfulne&s;s thereof; and when things go wrong through their own folly and wickedne&s;s, they cry to the Almighty to help them without correcting their mi&s;takes or amending their errors. It is none of the profe&s;&s;ed ends of this fa&s;t,
<PB N="42" REF="47">according to what is &s;ignified in the proclamation, to a&s;k the lord to in&s;truct them whether they have erred or not, or whether they &s;hould retract what they have done, or what they intend to do; but to implore aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to go on. They do not want direction how to proceed, but &s;trength to follow their own wi&s;dom. This is really mocking of God. They want not God to teach them their folly, but that he would enable them to proceed in it. The <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> of the cau&s;e is &s;ettled already; it is a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> was: there is nothing want|ing but power and &s;ucce&s;s. They are wor&s;e than the Greeks at the &s;iege of Troy, for they con&s;ulted Apollo concerning the cau&s;e of their ill &s;ucce&s;s, and reformed the error when they were told of it. They re&s;tored Chryeis, and made an atonement for their fault. But our managers want not to know the cau&s;e of their misfortunes, but have them removed without removing the cau&s;e. They know the cau&s;e perfectly, and it is prodigiou&s;ly impious to a&s;k a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the lord to proceed in a cau&s;e in which they never acknowledged his wi&s;dom by a&s;king his advice.</P>
<P>They do not behave like Jo&s;hua when I&s;rael was defeated before the men of <HI>Ai;</HI> he a&s;ked coun&s;el of the lord, and found out the <HI>cur&s;ed thing</HI> that was the cau&s;e of their misfortune. Were the men concerned in carrying on this war as &s;trictly examined as I&s;rael, there is rea&s;on to fear that the &s;ame cur&s;ed thing would be found among them, that was found in Achan's tent. Two hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver, a wedge of gold, and a Babyloni&s;h garment, were matters to the perqui&s;ites that are di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;ome offices.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now put the promoters of this fa&s;t in mind of what they may ea&s;ily know, that what they
<PB N="43" REF="48">intend to a&s;k upon their day of humiliation, the Almighty neither will nor can grant them, nor to any people el&s;e upon the &s;ame principle. What is the intention of this fa&s;t? Is it not to crave divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance to execute modern &s;tatutes, which are either doubtful in their nature, or contrary to fun|damental laws.&mdash;And with fire and &s;word again&s;t their brethren, who cannot perceive them in the &s;ame light that they do. This is in&s;tead of loo&s;ing the band of wickedne&s;s, wickedly &s;eeking to tie them. If the promoters of this fa&s;t cannot prove the&s;e &s;tatutes upon the authority of which they carry on this war con&s;i&s;tent with the moral attributes of God and the laws of the Briti&s;h empire, they cannot ex|pect, till they loo&s;e them, that the Almighty will regard their prayers any otherwi&s;e than with indig|nation and abhorrence.</P>
<P>According to the &s;tile of revelation, all unju&s;t and arbitrary decrees are bands of wickedne&s;s by what&s;oever human authority they are impo&s;ed, be|cau&s;e they are contrary to moral ju&s;tice, and are op|pre&s;&s;ive to the people. And though they can never bind the con&s;ciences of men, and &s;o have no moral influence, yet they are cords of oppre&s;&s;ion, that &s;it hard upon their bodies and their temporal intere&s;t. Laws that are unfriendly to the temporal intere&s;ts, and general good of &s;ociety; laws that are made to exalt a few to power and dignity, by &s;punging, &s;queezing, and oppre&s;&s;ing all other ranks of people, though contrived by angels, and executed by &s;aints, are bands of wickedne&s;s, which may &s;uffer for tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing, but can never &s;in in di&s;obeying.</P>
<P>When the rulers of a nation, to gratify their own lu&s;ts of pride and ambition, impo&s;e heavy and op|pre&s;&s;ive burdens upon the people by legi&s;lative au|thority, they e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by a law, which in
<PB N="44" REF="49">the <HI>&s;triste&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e of the words, is a band of iniquity. The lu&s;ts of princes and their &s;ervants, often create their own wants, and render them nece&s;&s;itous; they then make u&s;e of their power and influence to pro|cure laws to oblige others to &s;upply them, whether they are able or not; and what aggravates the evil, when the &s;ubjects know and feel that they are not able to an&s;wer the heavy demands of power, they are not allowed to be judges of their own abilities. Tho&s;e that rule over others ought to be &s;ober and temperate, and make the rea&s;onable finances of &s;tate &s;erve them in executing their offices. Unnece&s;&s;ary &s;plendor and expence in government are incon&s;i&s;tent with both rea&s;on and religion, which teach us that it is one of the great ends of laws and government to re&s;train unruly appetites and irregular pa&s;&s;ions. It is &s;inful in princes to coin expen&s;ive offices to &s;erve their favourites and oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects. No|thing can be more audacious, than for men appointed to be guardians of &s;ociety, with a de&s;ign to make individuals ea&s;y and happy to pretend to come be|fore the Lord in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to a&s;k his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;s them. Such is un|doubtedly the language of the en&s;uing fa&s;t, and of the conduct of its authors and devi&s;ers.</P>
<P>The poor in all parts of Britain are groaning un|der a heavy load of taxes, devi&s;ed for new purpo&s;es, and impo&s;ed by new &s;tatutes. But for what rea&s;ons? Where is the nece&s;&s;ity? What way are they applied? Are they not intended to carry violence and de&s;o|lation, fire and &s;word, among a people, who&s;e only fault is that they are endowed with principles and a &s;pirit which Engli&s;hmen once gloried in, and which &s;aved this nation from popery and arbitrary power, and will not part with what God and nature, and the laws have given them, to gratify the lu&s;ts of
<PB N="45" REF="50">men who have degenerated from the noble generous temper of their ance&s;tors, into ea&s;tern nabobs, and Turki&s;h ba&s;haws. The&s;e men have thought fit to con|trive war foreign and dome&s;tic, to gratify their de|praved pa&s;&s;ions, and the rich and poor throughout the nation mu&s;t be oppre&s;&s;ed to carry it on; bands of wick|edne&s;s are twi&s;ted one year after another, and the nation groans in chains. All the nece&s;&s;aries of life are in &s;ome way or other taxed; our &s;moke cannot a&s;|cend to the &s;ky, nor a ray of light peep in at our win|dows without paying an heavy impo&s;t. The in&s;ide as well as the out&s;ide of our hou&s;es are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and poor people who cannot, without great difficulty, afford to pay five pounds for a hou&s;e to lodge in through the year, mu&s;t now pay five &s;ixpences more. And for what rea&s;on? To carry on a war that originated in inju&s;tice, has been carried on with folly, and attended with di&s;grace and di&s;appoint|ment.&mdash;To &s;hed innocent blood, and carry death and de&s;olation acro&s;s the Atlantic to de&s;troy our brethren, to &s;atiate the voracious lu&s;ts of a few am|bitious men, who would wa&s;te the globe, and ruin heaven it&s;elf, provided they had the management thereof. Ah, Britain! will the God of mercy, who delights in forgiving offences, hear your prayers or regard your fa&s;ting, when you are twi&s;ting cords of oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of loo&s;ing bands of wickedne&s;s. Ah, ye rulers of the land, whither are ye ha&s;tening? You cannot run long when you are ru&s;hing upon the bo&s;&s;es of Jehovah's buckler! <HI>When you fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wicked|ne&s;s,</HI> do you imagine that the God of mercy will hear your prayers with acceptance, or regard your fa&s;ting any otherwi&s;e than &s;etting them down to the &s;um total of your pa&s;t iniquities?</P>
<P>Would Britain wi&s;h to have her prayers regarded, and her fa&s;ting accepted in the &s;ight of the Almighty,
<PB N="46" REF="51">let her loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s that &s;he has twi&s;ted, and break the chains that &s;he has forged for her brethren abroad, and the &s;ubjects at home. Let her repeal the&s;e novel and ho&s;tile laws made again&s;t her the&s;e colonies, and that have been made in con&s;e|quence thereof, which are &s;o hard to be borne by the people in the mother-country. Let her withdraw her fleets and armies, and &s;peak comfortably to her brethren, whom &s;he has &s;o much injured. Till this is done her fa&s;ts will want one e&s;&s;ential charac|teri&s;tic of a fa&s;t which the Lord hath cho&s;en. In the form of prayer for fa&s;ting la&s;t year, the bi&s;hops a&s;k the Lord for &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the Americans. Their graces and lord&s;hips certainly knew, that there was no occa&s;ion for re&s;i&s;tance on the part of Britain, with regard to the colonies. They had nothing to do but call home their forces, and none would trouble them. They meant to have &s;aid, <HI>Lord give us the good fortune to kill them:</HI> but it &s;tuck in their throat, and they &s;tammered out the word, <HI>re&s;i&s;t,</HI> unawares. I wi&s;h there may not be &s;pite in the ca&s;e; for the coloni&s;ts do not love bi&s;hops, and for that rea&s;on their reverences cannot forgive them.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is a po&s;itive requi&s;ite of a fa&s;t, which the Lord hath cho&s;en to undo heavy burdens; to bur&s;t them a&s;under and remove them all together. It is not &s;ufficient to lighten them a little; they mu&s;t be totally removed, as far as they are oppre&s;&s;ive. If they are not unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, they do not come under the de&s;cription of heavy burdens; but if they are oppre&s;&s;ive they mu&s;t be wholly taken away. The <HI>Bi&s;hop of London,</HI> in his new tran&s;lation of this prophecy, &s;eems to have he&s;itated when he came to this ver&s;e. He renders the word which is in our ver&s;ion <HI>undo,</HI> by the word <HI>loo&s;en,</HI> which greatly &s;oftens the &s;en&s;e. He was afraid to &s;ay <HI>bur&s;t a&s;un|der</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="52">or <HI>break in pieces,</HI> which is the true &s;ignifi|cation of the Hebrew word, becau&s;e this would have been too &s;trong an expre&s;&s;ion; and would have implied, that when legi&s;lators make unju&s;t and op|pre&s;&s;ive &s;tatutes, they mu&s;t pa&s;s over all forms in repealing them, before they can ob&s;erve a fa&s;t which the Lord hath cho&s;en. The word <HI>loo&s;en,</HI> has much the &s;ame import with the word <HI>&s;lacken,</HI> and implies <HI>&s;ome</HI> ea&s;e or relief, but not perfect liberty from the burden. But in the words of the text <HI>loo&s;en</HI> will not do; the burden mu&s;t be annihilated and <HI>totally</HI> de&s;troyed. The word undo in our tran&s;lation is exceedingly proper, and is well under&s;tood by the common people: they make u&s;e of it to &s;ignify to|tal ruin, and when they &s;ay any thing will <HI>undo</HI> them, they mean it will <HI>rain</HI> them. Therefore all heavy, oppre&s;&s;ive burdens mu&s;t be unmade and not merely loo&s;ened, before tho&s;e who lay them on can ob&s;erve an acceptable day to the Lord.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">What will explain this point clearly is the &s;ame u&s;e of the Hebrew word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in P&s;al. ii. iii. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Let us break or BURST THEIR BANDS ASUNDER. The Pro|phet Jeremiah would have &s;et the bi&s;hop right in this point, and &s;hewn him the true &s;en&s;e of the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, Jer. v. 5. I will get me up to the great men, and will &s;peak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord and the judgment of their God.&mdash;But the&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> have altogether broken the yoke, and BURST THE BONDS.</NOTE></P>
<P>The commandment in the words of the text is di|rected to the rulers of Judah, who at this time were grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ing the people; who to gratify, their own ambitious views and depraved inclinations, employed all their power and authority, to make the &s;ubjects contribute to their de&s;igns. This, in proce&s;s of time, became very oppre&s;&s;ive; for new projects were continually devi&s;ed, which their pride
<PB N="48" REF="53">&s;ugge&s;ted, and the poor were made to pay for the expence of their execution, though they were di|rectly contrary to their intere&s;t. This will always happen when power is in the hands of covetous, proud, and ambitious men, who con&s;ider all the in|ferior ranks of mankind made for no other purpo&s;e, than to &s;erve the ends of their pride, folly, and ambition. The poor in the days of Amos were &s;old for a pair of &s;hoes: the rulers thought no crime to oppre&s;s them in the la&s;t degree; and there is but little difference between making men &s;laves, and taking away from them the means of living.</P>
<P>Government would never be expen&s;ive provided rulers were hone&s;t and virtuous; it does not require much to &s;upport the real dignity of government, but it requires much to gratify the lu&s;ts of princes and their &s;ervants. The voracious and ungovern|able appetites of courties and placemen, come upon the &s;ubjects with heavy demands. The&s;e lay the greate&s;t impo&s;ts upon the poor people. Virtuous rulers will not require much to them&s;elves for doing their duty; they will con&s;ider virtue and integrity greater honours than robes of ermine, and &s;plendid equipage. <HI>Camillus</HI> and <HI>Cincinatus</HI> would have go|verned an empire a whole year at a &s;maller ex|pence, than Nero be&s;towed upon a &s;upper; and what would have &s;erved the whole &s;enate in the days of the commonwealth, would not have been a mouthful to Nero. Fame is not to be tru&s;ted, if a great number of our pre&s;ent burdens do not proceed from the luxuries of the great, who after they have &s;pent their fortunes upon their lu&s;ts, turn &s;laves to the court for <HI>places</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ions,</HI> which the hone&s;t poor are obliged to &s;upport. Such corrupted minions are ready on all occa&s;ions to vote perdition to a nation, provided they can have their lu&s;t ful|filled and their pa&s;&s;ions gratified. The&s;e men in&s;tead
<PB N="49" REF="54">of undoing burdens, undo nations, and are them|&s;elves the greate&s;t burden. Yet the&s;e godly child|ren of di&s;&s;ipation, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s have the daring a&s;&s;urance to call for a national fa&s;t, when all the year through, they are employed in wanton la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, gamboling, and wa&s;ting the public trea&s;ure. To &s;upport a &s;warm of the&s;e impure lo|cu&s;ts, the virtuous labourer, and hone&s;t trade&s;man mu&s;t be burdened with taxes beyond all rea&s;onable bounds. Say not, O ye &s;ons of di&s;&s;ipation, and prodigality, that it is for the &s;upport of govern|ment, that the&s;e burdens are laid on, for we know the contrary. Is it a dignity to government, or a real &s;upport to it, to maintain men in high offices of &s;tate, who&s;e characters are a &s;candal to &s;ociety, and a burle&s;que of all good rule and moral laws? Does it dignify and &s;upport government, to wa&s;te the &s;ub&s;tance of a nation, upon Paphian rites, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and in &s;upporting a &s;eraglio of fallen angels, together with a number of young &s;prigs of iniquity, educated in the &s;ame practices, and initiated in all the arts of &s;eduction and impuri|ty? Yet fame reports, that for &s;uch purpo&s;es is the trea&s;ure of the nation wa&s;ted, the public money &s;quandered, and the poor more and more oppre&s;&s;ed. Our <HI>diguified fa&s;ters</HI> mu&s;t not expect that the lord will regard their fa&s;ting, until &s;uch time as they <HI>undo the heavy burdens,</HI> which the nation is groaning under. Till they do this, their fa&s;t is not &s;uch a fa&s;t as the Lord hath cho&s;en.</P>
<P>It has a very &s;trange a&s;pect to &s;ee men who are continuing in ab&s;urd and prepo&s;terous mea&s;ures, which even children would blu&s;h to be authors of, &s;o impious as to &s;ollicit heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, when they may be &s;ure, that this cannot be done provided God is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>holy.</HI> The Jewi&s;h rulers mu&s;t have made a ridiculous figure in the e&s;teem of the prophet, when they ob&s;erved forms of fa&s;ting and humiliation,
<PB N="50" REF="55">in the very in&s;tant they were contriving grievous op|pre&s;&s;ions to others, and living in all &s;orts of volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s them&s;elves. It is exceeding farcical and ab&s;urd, to behold men who de&s;pi&s;e all religion both in their hearts and practice, among the fir&s;t to in|force an exerci&s;e which cannot be performed without the fear of the Lord. Would the devi&s;ers of the en|&s;uing fa&s;t really de&s;ire that God &s;hould regard it in mercy, they ought to change their form of prayer from what it was the la&s;t year, and reform their own conver&s;ations. In&s;tead of praying for &s;ucce&s;s to the pre&s;ent war, they ought to pray to God to forgive their wickedne&s;s in beginning it, and carrying it on: &s;peedily give it over, withdraw their troops, take &s;hame to them&s;elves, and blu&s;h for their iniquity. With regard to their private deportment, they mu&s;t mortify their pride, give over their luxury, di&s;mi&s;s their fallen angels, and live &s;ober and cha&s;te;&mdash;dignify government by their &s;elf denial and mortification, &s;erve their country for the dividends of inheritance, which Providence has given them more than others; repeal the heavy tax laws that have been made of late years, that the poor may be able to live with more ea&s;e, and pray to God for their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Although per&s;ons in high life think little of the prayers of the poor, yet I will hint a &s;ecret to them, which perhaps they were not thinking of, and that is,&mdash;that in times like the&s;e in which we live, the prayers of the poor are the only prayers that the Al|mighty regards. <Q>He will regard the prayer of &startq;the de&s;titute, and not de&s;pi&s;e their prayer; this &s;hall be written for the generations to come&mdash;for he hath looked down from the height of his &s;anctuary, from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the pri&s;oner, to loo&s;e tho&s;e that are appointed unto death. For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and the &s;ighs of the
<PB N="51" REF="56">needy, will I ari&s;e (&s;aith the Lord) I will &s;et him &endq;in &s;afety from tho&s;e that puff at him.</Q>&mdash;There are not &s;uch promi&s;es made in all the Scripture to the noble and the rich. Their graces and reverences have generally as little influence at the throne of mercy, as the poor in this world have at the thrones of temporal princes. Although many vain men in high life, de&s;pi&s;e the poor on account of their mean|ne&s;s, and generally &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of them, yet many of the poor are incapable of doing &s;uch mean actions as &s;ome of their &s;uperiors in rank are capable of: they have in general a truer &s;en&s;e of con&s;cience, and are better acquainted with God. Even the mo&s;t vicious among the vulgar, are not equal in profligacy to tho&s;e of the &s;ame character among the great. And the common people are not &s;o ignorant, but they can ea&s;ily perceive that tho&s;e who rule over others, &s;hould them&s;elves walk accord|ing to moral laws. They con&s;ider government in the hands of the wicked, unworthy of that re&s;pect that is due to virtuous rulers; and they are fully per&s;uaded that it can never an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of felicity to &s;ociety, when it is made more &s;ub&s;er|vient to the pa&s;&s;ions of governors, than to the good of the public.</P>
<P>If the devi&s;ers of this fa&s;t only heard what the common people &s;ay concerning it, it would a&s;toni&s;h them. They really make many &s;hrewd remarks up|on it. They in the fir&s;t place ob&s;erve, that the mi|ni&s;try are now grievou&s;ly pinched when they betake them&s;elves to the Lord for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They &s;ay there mu&s;t be lo&s;&s;es that we have heard nothing of in the Gazette, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have had no fa&s;t|ing. When the two Brothers were &s;ucce&s;sful, and Bur|goyne was driving all before him, there was not a word of humiliation or of &s;eeking the Lord. Ah! it is all over now when our mini&s;try turn devout. When
<PB N="52" REF="57">the &s;ailors begin to pray there is no hope of &s;afety, the ve&s;&s;el is about &s;inking.&mdash;Had they intended to have had heaven on their &s;ide they ought to have begun with a&s;king the will of God, and laid the foundation of their plan in ju&s;tice; but now when they have mi&s;managed all, do they imagine that the Lord will regard them? There is yet ju&s;tice in heaven.&mdash;What have our brethren done to de&s;erve the treatment they have met with? We would do the &s;ame things our&s;elves, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances; and mu&s;t we a&s;k God to give aid to mea&s;ures which our own hearts condemn? That would be &s;olly in the extreme.&mdash;We &s;hould not wonder if there were thunder and lightning all that day, or &s;ome ter|rible earthquake: it is a mo&s;t dreadful thing to mock God. It is marvellous that the bi&s;hops &s;hould have any hand in it. Alas! they mind nothing except honours and preferment, otherwi&s;e they would never have engaged in &s;uch awful and profane bu&s;ine&s;s. God has ble&s;&s;ed us with great abundance for &s;ome years pa&s;t; but it will be a miracle if there is not a famine in the land before it be long.&mdash;What al|though we &s;hould all join again&s;t the French, what will it &s;ignify? when &s;uch ba&s;e men are at the helm of affairs, we are &s;ure of nothing: they would wa&s;te the world, and when we have a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to &s;erve their own purpo&s;es, they will &s;erve us as they intended to &s;erve the Coloni&s;ts. They &s;hall neither have our prayers nor our wi&s;hes, except to wi&s;h them to be called to account for the evil they have done.&mdash;This is certainly not <HI>&s;uch a fa&s;t as the Lord hath cho&s;en: to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s and undo heavy bur|dens.</HI> Alas no! This is <HI>fa&s;ting for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s.</HI> Good Lord deliver us from it; it will ruin us all. Many &s;uch ob&s;ervations do the people make, concerning the en&s;unig Fa&s;t.&mdash;But I &s;hall now conclude.</P>
