<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Ferdinand Count Fathom.</HEAD>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is &s;mitten with the charms of a female adven|turer,
who&s;e allurements &s;ubject him to a new
vici&s;&s;itude of fortune.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by his gallantry, was the young wife of
an old citizen of London, who had
granted her permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ide at the Hot-well
for the benefit of her health, under the eye and
in&s;pection of his own &s;i&s;ter, who was a maiden
of fifty years. The pupil, who&s;e name was Mrs.
Trapwell, though low in &s;tature, was &s;inely
&s;haped, her countenance engaging, though her
complexion was brown, her hair in colour ri|valled
the raven's back, and her eyes emulated
the lu&s;tre of the diamond. Fathom had been
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;truck with her fir&s;t appearance; but found it
impracticable to elude the vigilance of her du|enna,
&s;o as to make a declaration of his flame;
until &s;he her&s;elf gue&s;&s;ing the &s;ituation of his
thoughts, and not di&s;plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery,
thought proper to furni&s;h him with the oppor|tunity
he wanted, by counterfeiting an indi&s;po|&s;ition,
for the cure of which, &s;he knew his ad|vice
would be implored. This was the begin|ning
of an acquaintance, which was &s;oon im|proved
to his wi&s;h; and &s;o well did &s;he manage
her attractions, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to fix the
incon&s;tancy of his di&s;po&s;ition; for, at the end
of the &s;ea&s;on, his pa&s;&s;ion was not &s;ated; and
they concerted the means of continuing their
commerce, even after their return to London.</P>
<P>This intercour&s;e effectually an&s;wered the pur|po&s;e
of the hu&s;band, who had been decoyed into
matrimony, by the cunning of his &s;pou&s;e, whom
he had privately kept as a concubine before
marriage. Con&s;cious of her own precarious &s;itua|tion,
&s;he had re&s;olved to impo&s;e upon the infir|mities
of Trapwell, and feigning her&s;elf preg|nant,
gave him to under&s;tand &s;he could no lon|ger
conceal her condition from the knowledge
of her brother, who was an officer in the army,
and of &s;uch violent pa&s;&s;ions, that &s;hould he once
di&s;cover her back&s;liding, he would undoubtedly
wipe away the &s;tains of his family-di&s;honour
with her own blood, as well as that of her
keeper. The citizen, to prevent &s;uch a cata&s;|trophe,
took her to wife; but &s;oon after perceiv|ing
the trick which had been played upon him,
&s;et his invention at work, and at length contriv|ed
a &s;cheme which he thought would enable
him, not only to retrieve his liberty, but al&s;o in|demnify
<PB N="3" REF="4">
him&s;elf for the mortification he had un|dergone.</P>
<P>Far from creating any dome&s;tic di&s;turbance,
by upbraiding her with her fine&s;&s;e, he &s;eemed
perfectly well plea&s;ed with his acqui&s;ition; and as
he knew her void of any principle, and extremely
addicted to plea&s;ure, he cho&s;e proper occa&s;ions
to in&s;inuate, that &s;he might gratify her own in|clination,
and at the &s;ame time turn her beauty
to good account. She joyfully li&s;tened to the&s;e
remon&s;trances, and in con&s;equence of their mu|tual
agreement, &s;he repaired to Bri&s;tol-&s;pring,
on pretence of an ill &s;tate of health accom|panied
by her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, whom they did not
think proper to intru&s;t with the real motive of
her journey. Fathom's per&s;on was agreeable,
and his finances &s;uppo&s;ed to be in flouri&s;hing
order; therefore, &s;he &s;elected him from the
herd of gallants, as a proper &s;acrifice to the
powers which &s;he adored; and on her arrival in
London, made her hu&s;band acquainted with the
importance of her conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Trapwell overwhelmed her with care&s;&s;es and
prai&s;e for her di&s;creet and dutiful conduct, and
faithfully promi&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould pocket in her
own privy pur&s;e, one half of the &s;poils that
&s;hould be gathered from her gallant, whom &s;he
therefore undertook to betray, after he had
&s;wore in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that his in|tention
was not to bring the affair to a public
trial, which would redound to his own di&s;grace,
but to extort a round &s;um of money from the
count, by way of compo&s;ition. Confiding in
this prote&s;tation, &s;he in a few days, gave him
intelligence of an a&s;&s;ignation &s;he had made with
our adventurer, at a certain bagnio near Covent|garden;
<PB N="4" REF="5">
upon which he &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a particular friend and his own journeyman,
with whom, and a con&s;table, he repaired to the
place of rendezvous, where he waited in an ad|joining
room according to the directions of his
virtuous &s;pou&s;e, until &s;he made the preconcerted
&s;ignal of hemming three times aloud, when he
and his a&s;&s;ociates ru&s;hed into the chamber and
&s;urpri&s;ed our hero in bed with his inamorata.</P>
<P>The lady, on this occa&s;ion, acted her part to
a miracle; &s;he &s;creamed at their approach; and
after an exclamation of &startq;ruined and undone!&endq;
fainted away in the arms of her &s;pou&s;e, who had
by this time &s;eized her by the &s;houlders, and be|gun
to upbraid her, with her infidelity and guilt.
As for Fathom, his affliction was unutterable,
when he &s;ound him&s;elf di&s;covered in that &s;itua|tion,
and made pri&s;oner by the two a&s;&s;i&s;tants,
who had pinioned him in &s;uch a manner, that
he could not $$ir, much le&s;s accompli&s;h an e&s;cape.
All his ingenuity and pre&s;ence of mind, &s;eemed
to for&s;ake him in this emergency. The horrors
of an Engli&s;h jury over&s;pread his imagination:
for he at once perceived that the toil into which
he had fallen, was laid for the purpo&s;e; con&s;e|quently
he took it for granted, that there would
be no deficiency in point of evidence. Soon as
he recollected him&s;elf, he begged that no violence
might be offered to his per&s;on, and intreated the
hu&s;band to favour him with a conference, in
which the affair might be compromi&s;ed, without
prejudice to the reputation of either.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, Trapwell breathed nothing but im|placable
revenge, but by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his
friends, after he had &s;ent home his wife in a
chair, he was prevailed upon to hear the propo|&s;als
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of the delinquent, who having a&s;&s;ured him,
by way of apology, that he had always believed
the lady was a widow, made him an offer of
five hundred pounds, as an atonement for the
injury he had &s;u&s;tained. This being a &s;um no
ways adequate to the expectation of the citizen,
who looked upon the count as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of an
immen&s;e e&s;tate, he rejected the terms with di&s;|dain,
and made in&s;tant application to a judge,
from whom he obtained a warrant for &s;ecuring
his per&s;on till the day of trial. Indeed, in this
ca&s;e, money was but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration
with Trapwell, who&s;e chief aim was to be le|gally
divorced from a woman he dete&s;ted. There|fore,
there was no remedy for the unhappy
count, who in vain offered to double the &s;um:
he found him&s;elf reduced to the bitter alternative
of procuring immediate bail, or going directly to
Newgate.</P>
<P>In this dilemma he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to his
friend Ratchkali, who&s;e countenance &s;ell when
he under&s;tood the count's condition; nor would
he open his mouth in the &s;tile of con&s;olation,
until he had con&s;ulted a certain &s;ollicitor of his
acquaintance, who a&s;&s;ured him the law abound|ed
with &s;uch re&s;ources, as would infallibly &s;creen
the defendant, had the fact been &s;till more pal|pable
than it was. He &s;aid there was great pre|&s;umption
to believe the count had fallen a &s;acri|fice
to a con&s;piracy, which by &s;ome means or
other would be detected; and in that ca&s;e, the
plaintiff might obtain one &s;hilling in lieu of da|mages.
If that dependance &s;hould fail, he hint|ed
that, in all probability, the witne&s;&s;es were not
incorruptible; or &s;hould they prove to be &s;o,
one man's oath was as good as another's, and
<PB N="6" REF="7">
thank Heaven, there was no dearth of evidence,
provided money could be found to an&s;wer the
nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Ratchkali comforted by the&s;e in&s;inuations,
and dreading the re&s;entment of our adventurer,
who in his de&s;pair, might puni&s;h him &s;everely for
his want of friend&s;hip, by &s;ome precipitate ex|planation
of the commerce they had carried on;
moved, I &s;ay, by the&s;e con&s;iderations, and more|over
tempted with the pro&s;pect of continuing to
reap the advantages re&s;ulting from their conjunc|tion,
he and another per&s;on of credit with whom
he largely dealt in jewels, conde&s;cended to be|come
&s;ureties for the appearance of Fathom,
who was accordingly admitted to bail. Not but
that the Tyroleze knew Ferdinand too well, to
confide in his parole: he depended chiefly upon
his ideas of &s;elf-intere&s;t, which he thought,
would per&s;uade him to ri&s;k the uncertain i&s;&s;ue of
a trial, rather than quit the field before the har|ve&s;t
was half over; and he re&s;olved to make
his own retreat without ceremony, &s;hould our
hero be unwi&s;e enough to abandon his bail.</P>
<P>Such an adventure could not long lie con|cealed
from the notice of the public, even if
both parties had been at pains to &s;uppre&s;s the
circum&s;tances: but the plaintiff, far from &s;eeking
to cover, affected to complain loudly of his
misfortune, that he might intere&s;t his neighbours
in his behalf, and rai&s;e a &s;pirit of rancour and
animo&s;ity, to influence the jury again&s;t this in&s;o|lent
foreigner, who had come over into England
to debauch our wives and deflower our daugh|ters;
while he employed a formidable band of
lawyers to &s;upport the indictment, which he &s;aid
for ten thou&s;and pounds damages.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Mean while, Fathom and his a&s;&s;ociate did not
fail to take all proper mea&s;ures for his defence;
they retained a powerful bar of council, and the
&s;ollicitor was &s;upplied with one hundred pounds
after another, to an&s;wer the expence of &s;ecret
&s;ervice; &s;till a&s;&s;uring his clients that every thing
was in an excellent train, and that his adver&s;ary
would gain nothing but &s;hame and confu&s;ion of
face. Neverthele&s;s, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for
po&s;tponing the trial, on account of a material
evidence, who, though he wavered, was not
yet quite brought over; and the attorney found
means to put off the deci&s;ion from term to term,
until there was no quibble left for further delay.
While this &s;uit was depending, our hero conti|nued
to move in his u&s;ual &s;phere; nor did the
report of his &s;ituation at all operate to his di&s;ad|vantage,
in the polite world: on the contrary,
it added a fre&s;h plume to his character, in the
eyes of all tho&s;e who were not before acquaint|ed
with the triumphs of his gallantry. Not|with&s;tanding
this countenance of his friends, he
him&s;elf con&s;idered the affair in a very &s;erious light;
and perceiving that at any rate he mu&s;t be a con&s;i|derable
lo&s;er, he re&s;olved to double his a&s;&s;iduity in
trade, that he might be the more able to afford
the extraordinary expence to which he was
&s;ubjected.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="9">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fre&s;h cau&s;e for exerting his equanimity and for|titude.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader may have ob&s;erved, that Fa|thom
with all his circum&s;pection, had a
weak &s;ide, which expo&s;ed him to &s;undry mi&s;|chances:
this was his covetou&s;ne&s;s, which on
&s;ome occa&s;ions became too hard for his di&s;cre|tion:
at this period of time, it was by the cir|cum&s;tances
of his &s;ituation, inflamed to a degree
of rapacity. He was now prevailed upon to
take a hand at whi&s;t, or piquet, and even to
wield the hazard-box; though he had hitherto
declared him&s;elf an irreconcileable enemy to all
forts of play; and &s;o uncommon was his &s;ucce&s;s
and dexterity at the&s;e exerci&s;es, as to &s;urprize
his acquaintance, and arrou&s;e the &s;u&s;picion of
&s;ome people, who repined at his pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>But in nothing was his conduct more inexcu&s;|able,
than in giving way to the dangerous teme|rity
of Ratchkali, which he had been always at
pains to re&s;train, and permitting him to practi&s;e
the &s;ame fraud upon an Engli&s;h nobleman, which
had been executed upon him&s;elf at Franckfort.
In other words, the Tyroleze by the canal of
Ferdinand's finger and recommendation, &s;old a
pebble for a real brilliant, and in a few days the
cheat was di&s;covered, to the infinite confu&s;ion of
our adventurer, who neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;umed the
gui&s;e of innocence, with &s;o much art, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;uch indignation again&s;t the villain, who
had i mpo&s;ed upon his judgment and un&s;u&s;pecting
gener o&s;ity, that his lord&s;hip acquitted him of any
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;hare in the deceit, and contented him&s;elf with
the re&s;titution, which he in&s;i&s;ted upon making
out of his own pocket, until he &s;hould be able
to apprehend the rogue, who had thought pro|per
to ab&s;cond for his own &s;afety. In &s;pite of
all this exculpation, his character did not fail to
retain a &s;ort of &s;tigma, which indeed the plain|e&s;t
proofs of innocence are hardly able to efface;
and his connexion with &s;uch a palpable knave
as the Tyroleze appeared to be, had an effect to
his prejudice, in the minds of all tho&s;e who
were privy to the occurrence.</P>
<P>When a man's reputation is once brought in
que&s;tion, every trifle is by the malevolence of
mankind, magnified into a &s;trong pre&s;umption
again&s;t the culprit: a few whi&s;pers communi|cated
by the envious mouth of &s;lander, which
he can have no opportunity to an&s;wer and re|fute,
&s;hall, in the opinion of the world, convict
him of the mo&s;t horrid crimes; and for one hy|pocrite
who is decked with the honours of vir|tue,
there are twenty good men who &s;uffer the
ignominy of vice; &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed are indivi|duals
to trample upon the fame of their fellow|creatures.
If the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed merit is not
protected from this inju&s;tice, it will not be won|dered
at, that no quarter was given to the cha|racter
of an adventurer like Fathom, who a|mong
other unlucky occurrences, had the mi&s;|fortune
to be recognized about this time, by his
two Pari&s;ian friends Sir Stentor Stiles and Sir
Giles Squirrel.</P>
<P>The&s;e worthy knights-errant had returned to
their own country, after having made a very
pro&s;perous campaign in France, at the end of
which, however, they very narrowly e&s;caped
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the gallies; and &s;eeing the Poli&s;h count &s;eated
at the head of ta&s;te and politene&s;s, they imme|diately
circulated the &s;tory of his defeat at Paris,
with many ludicrous circum&s;tances of their own
invention, and did not &s;cruple to affirm that he
was a rank impo&s;tor. When the laugh is rai&s;ed
upon a great man, he never fails to dwindle
into contempt. Ferdinand began to per|ceive
a change in the countenance of his friends.
His company was no longer &s;ollicited with that
eagerne&s;s which they had formerly expre&s;&s;ed in
his behalf: even his entertainments were neg|lected;
when he appeared at any private or pub|lic
a&s;&s;embly, the ladies, in&s;tead of glowing with
plea&s;ure, as formerly, now tittered or regarded
him with looks of di&s;dain; and a certain pert,
little, forward coquette, with a view to put him
out of countenance by rai&s;ing the laugh at his ex|pence,
a&s;ked him one night, at a drum, when
he had heard from his relations in Poland? She
&s;ucceeded in her de&s;ign upon the mirth of the
audience, but was di&s;appointed in the other
part of her aim; for, our hero replied without
the lea&s;t mark of di&s;compo&s;ure, &startq;They are all
in good health at your &s;ervice, madam; I wi&s;h
I knew in what part of the world your rela|tions
re&s;ide, that I might return the compliment.&endq;
By this an&s;wer, which was the more &s;evere, as
the young lady was of very doubtful extrac|tion,
he retorted the laugh upon the aggre&s;&s;or,
though he likewi&s;e failed in his attempt upon her
temper: for, &s;he was perhaps the only per&s;on pre|&s;ent,
who equall'd him&s;elf in&s;tability of countenance.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this appearance of uncon|cern,
he was deeply touched with the&s;e mark$
of alienation, in the behaviour of his friends
<PB N="11" REF="12">
and fore&s;eeing in his own di&s;grace, the total
&s;hipwreck of his fortune, he entered into a me|lancholy
deliberation with him&s;elf, about the
means of retrieving his importance in the beau|monde,
or of turning his addre&s;s into &s;ome other
channel, where he could &s;tand upon a le&s;s &s;lip|pery
foundation. In this exerci&s;e of his thoughts,
no &s;cheme occured more fea&s;ible, than that of
&s;ecuring the booty he had made, and retiring
with his a&s;&s;ociate, who was al&s;o blown, into &s;ome
other country, where, their names and charac|ters
being unknown, they might pur&s;ue their
old plan of commerce without mole&s;tation. He
imparted this &s;ugge&s;tion to the Tyroleze, who
approved the propo&s;al of decamping, though he
combated with all his might our hero's inclina|tion
to withdraw him&s;elf before the trial, by
repeating the a&s;&s;urances of the &s;ollicitor$ who told
him he might depend upon being reimbur&s;ed by the
&s;entence of the court, for great part of the &s;ums
he had expended in the cour&s;e of the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Fathom &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by
the&s;e arguments, &s;upported with the de&s;ire of
making an honourable retreat, and waiting pati|ently
for the day of trouble, di&s;charged his &s;ure|ties,
by a per&s;onal appearance in court. Yet
this was not the only &s;core he di&s;charged that
morning; the &s;ollicitor pre&s;ented his own bill
before they &s;et out for We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and
gave the count to under&s;tand that it was the
cu&s;tom, from time immemorial, for the client to
clear with his attorney before trial. Ferdinand
had nothing to object again&s;t this e&s;tabli&s;hed
rule, though he looked upon it as a bad omen,
in &s;pite of all the &s;ollicitor's confidence and pro|te&s;tations;
and he was not a little confounded,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
when looking into the contents, he found him|&s;elf
charged with 350 attendances. He knew
it was not his intere&s;t to di&s;oblige his lawyer at
&s;uch a juncture; neverthele&s;s, he could not help
expo&s;tulating with him on this article, which
&s;eemed to be &s;o fal&s;ly &s;tated with regard to the
number; when his que&s;tions drew on an expla|nation,
by which he found he had incurred the
penalty of three &s;hillings and four-pence for
every time he chanced to meet the con&s;cienti|ous
attorney, either in the park, the coffee-hou&s;e
or the &s;treet, provided they had exchanged the
common &s;alutation: and he had great rea&s;on to
believe the &s;ollicitor had often thrown him&s;elf in
his way, with a view to &s;well this item of his
account.</P>
<P>With this extortion our adventurer was fain
to comply, becau&s;e he lay at the mercy of the
caitiff; accordingly, he with a good grace paid
the demand, which including his former di&s;|bur&s;ements,
amounted to three hundred and
&s;ixty-five pounds eleven &s;hillings three-pence
three farthings, and then pre&s;enting him&s;elf be|fore
the judge, quietly &s;ubmitted to the laws of
the realm. His council behaved like men of
con&s;ummate abilities in their profe&s;&s;ion; they ex|erted
them&s;elves with equal indu&s;try, eloquence
and erudition, in their endeavours to perplex the
truth, browbeat the evidence, puzzle the judge,
and mi&s;lead the jury: but the defendant found
him&s;elf woefully di&s;appointed in the depo&s;ition
of Trapwell's journeyman, whom the &s;ollicitor
pretended to have converted to his intere&s;t:
this witne&s;s, as the attorney afterwards declared,
played booty, and the facts came out &s;o clear,
that Ferdinand Count Fathom was convicted of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
criminal conver&s;ation with the plaintiff's wife,
and ca&s;t in fifteen hundred pounds, under the de|nomination
of damages.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o much &s;urprized as afflicted at
this deci&s;ion, becau&s;e he &s;aw it gradually approach|ing
from the examination of the fir&s;t evidence:
his thoughts were now employed in ca&s;ting about
for &s;ome method of deliverance, from the &s;nare
in which he found him&s;elf intangled. To e&s;cape
he fore&s;aw it would be impracticable, as Trap|well
would undoubtedly be prepared for arre&s;ting
him before he could quit We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; he
was too well acquainted with Ratchkali's prin|ciples,
to expect any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter,
in money matters; and he was utterly aver&s;e
to the payment of the &s;um awarded again&s;t him,
which would have exhau&s;ted his whole fortune.
He therefore re&s;olved to try the friend&s;hip of
&s;ome per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, with whom he had
maintained an intimacy of corre&s;pondence: &s;hould
they fail him in the day of his nece&s;&s;ity, he pro|po&s;ed
to have recour&s;e to his former &s;ureties,
one of whom he meant to bilk, while the
other might accompany him in his retreat: or,

rather than part with his effects, to
undergo the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable confinement, in
hope of obtaining the jailor's connivance at his
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;olutions being taken, he met his fate
with great fortitude and equanimity, and calm|ly
&s;uffered him&s;elf to be conveved to the hou&s;e
of a &s;heriff's officer, who, as he made his exit
from the hall, according to his own expectation,
executed a writ again&s;t him, at the &s;uit of Trap|well,
for a debt of two thou&s;and pounds. To
<PB N="14" REF="15">
this place he was followed by his &s;ollicitor, who
was allured by the pro&s;pect of another job, and
who with great demon&s;trations of &s;atisfaction,
congratulated him upon the happy i&s;&s;ue of the
trial; arrogating to him&s;elf, the merit of having
&s;aved him eight thou&s;and pounds, in the article
of damages, by the previous &s;teps he had taken,
and the noble defence that he and his friends the
council had made for their client: he even hinted
an expectation of receiving a gratuity for his ex|traordinary
care and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Fathom, galled as he was with his misfortune,
and enraged at the effrontery of this petti&s;ogger,
maintained a &s;erenity of countenance, and &s;ent
the attorney with a me&s;&s;age to the plaintiff,
importing, that as he was a foreigner, and could
not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;o much ca&s;h about him,
as to &s;pare fifteen hundred pounds from the funds
of his ordinary expence, he would grant him a
bond payable in two months, during which pe|riod,
he &s;hould be able to procure a proper re|mittance
from his own e&s;tate. While the &s;olli|citor
was employed in this negociation, he di&s;|patched
his valet de chambre to one nobleman,
and Maurice to another, with billets, &s;ignifying
the nature of the verdict which his adver&s;ary
had obtained, and de&s;iring that each would lend
him a thou&s;and pounds upon his parole, until he
could negociate bills upon the continent.</P>

<P>Trapwell ab&s;olutely rejected his per&s;onal &s;e|curity;

of a goal, unle&s;s he would immediately di&s;charge

<P>Ferdinand was not &s;uch a novice in the world
as to be di&s;appointed at the&s;e repul&s;es; e&s;pecially
as he had laid very little &s;tre&s;s upon the applica|tion,
which was made by way of an experiment
<PB N="17" REF="18">
upon the gratitude or caprice of tho&s;e two no|blemen,
whom he had actually more than once

now &s;ollicited, though not to &s;uch a con&s;iderable
amount.</P>
<P>Having nothing further to expect from the
fa&s;hionable world, he &s;ent the Tyroleze to the
per&s;on who had been bail for his appearance,
with full in&s;tructions to explain his pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion
in the mo&s;t favourable light, and de&s;ire he
would reinforce the credit of the count with his
&s;ecurity; but, that gentleman, though he placed
the mo&s;t perfect confidence on the honour of
our hero, and would have willingly entered into
bonds again for his per&s;onal appearance, was not
quite &s;o well &s;atisfied of his circum&s;tances, as
to become liable for the payment of two thou&s;and
pounds, an expence, which in his opinion, the
finances of no foreign count were able to de|fray:
he therefore, lent a deaf ear to the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances of the amba&s;&s;ador, who
had recour&s;e to &s;everal other merchants, with
the &s;ame bad &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that the pri&s;oner de|&s;pairing

thou&s;and pounds towards his di&s;charge, that he
might be enabled to quit England with a good
grace, and execute his part of the plan they
had projected.</P>
<P>So powerful was his eloquence on the occa&s;ion,
and &s;uch &s;trength of argument did he u&s;e, that
even the Tyroleze &s;eemed convinced, though
reluctantly, and agreed to advance the nece&s;&s;ary

<P>YET, he had no &s;ooner committed his ef|fects
to the care of this triumvirate, than
his fancy was vi&s;ited with direful warnings, which
produced cold &s;weats and palpitations, and threw
him into &s;uch agonies of apprehen&s;ion as he
had never known before. He remembred the
former de&s;ertion of the Tyroleze, the recent
villainy of the &s;ollicitor, and recollected the re|marks
he had made upon the di&s;po&s;ition and cha|racter
of his valet, which evinced him a fit com|panion
for the other two.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the&s;e reflections, he intreated the
bailiff to indulge him with a vi&s;it to his own
lodgings, and even offered one hundred guineas
as a gratification for his compliance. But, the
officer, who had formerly lo&s;t a con&s;iderable &s;um
by the e&s;cape of a pri&s;oner, would not run any
ri&s;que in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, and our
hero was obliged to &s;ubmit to the tortures of his
own pre&s;aging fears. After he had waited five
hours in the mo&s;t racking impatience, he &s;aw
the attorney enter with all the marks of hurry,
fatigue and con&s;ternation, and heard him ex|claim,
&startq;Good God, have you &s;een the gentle|man?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
Fathom found his fears realized in this inter|rogation,
to which he an&s;wered in a tone of
horror and di&s;may, &startq;What gentleman? I &s;up|po&s;e
I am robbed: &s;peak and keep me no longer
in &s;u&s;pence.&endq; &startq;Robbed! cried the attorney, the
Lord forbid! I hope you can depend upon the
per&s;on you impowered to receive your jewels
and ca&s;h. I mu&s;t own his proceedings are a lit|tle
extraordinary: for after he had rummaged
your &s;crutore, from which in pre&s;ence of me
and your &s;ervant, he took one hundred and fifty
guineas, a parcel of diamond rings and buckles
according to this here inventory, which I wrote
with my own hand, and Ea&s;t-India bonds to the
tune of five hundred more, we adjourned to
Garraway's, where he left me alone, under pre|tence
of going to a broker of his acquaintance
who lived in the neighbourhood, while the va|let,
as I imagined, waited for us in the alley.
Well, Sir, he &s;tayed &s;o long, that I began to be
unea&s;y, and at length re&s;olved to &s;end the &s;er|vant
in que&s;t of him, but when I went out for
that purpo&s;e, deuce a &s;ervant was to be found.
Though I in per&s;on inquired for him, at every
alehou&s;e within half a mile of the place. I
then di&s;patched no le&s;s than five ticket porters
upon the &s;cent after them, and I my&s;elf by a
direction from the bar-keeper, went to &s;ignor
Ratchkali's lodgings, where, as they told me,
he had not been &s;een &s;ince nine o'clock in the
morning. Upon this intimation, I came directly
hither, to give you timely notice, that you
may without delay, take mea&s;ures for your own
&s;ecurity. The be&s;t thing you can do, is to take
out writs for apprehending him, in the counties
of Middle&s;ex, Surry, Kent and E&s;&s;ex, and I
<PB N="20" REF="21">
&s;hall put them in the hands of tru&s;ty and dili|gent
officers, who will &s;oon ferret him out of his
lurking-place, provided he &s;culks within ten
miles of the bills of mortality: to be &s;ure the
job will be expen&s;ive; and all the&s;e runners mu&s;t
be paid before-hand. But, what then? the
defendant is worth powder, and if we can once
&s;ecure him, I'll warrant the pro&s;ecution will quit
co&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom was almo&s;t choaked with concern and
re&s;entment, at the news of this mi&s;chance, &s;o
that he could not utter one word until this nar|rative
was fini&s;hed. Nor was his &s;u&s;picion con|fined
to the Tyroleze and his own lacquey; he
con&s;idered the &s;ollicitor as their accomplice and
director, and was &s;o much provoked at the latter
part of his harangue, that his di&s;cretion &s;eemed
to vani&s;h, and collaring the attorney, &startq;Vil|lain!
&s;aid he, you your&s;elf have been a principal
actor in this robbery;&endq; Then turning to the by|&s;tanders,
&startq;and I de&s;ire in the king's name, that
he may be &s;ecured, until I can make oath before
a magi&s;trate, in &s;upport of the charge. If you
refu&s;e your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in detaining him, I will
make immediate application to one of the &s;ecre|taries
of &s;tate who is my particular friend, and
he will &s;ee ju&s;tice done to all parties.&endq;</P>
<P>At mention of this formidable name, the
bailiff and his whole family were in commotion,
to ob&s;truct the retreat of the lawyer, who &s;tood
agha&s;t, and trembled under the gra&s;p of our ad|venturer:
but, &s;oon as he found him&s;elf deli|vered
from this embrace, by the interpo&s;ition
of the &s;pectators, and collected his &s;pirits, which
had been &s;uddenly di&s;&s;ipated by Fathom's unex|pected
a&s;&s;ault, he began to di&s;play one art of his
<PB N="21" REF="22">
occupation, which he always re&s;erved for extra|ordinary
occa&s;ions: this was the talent of abu&s;e,
which he poured forth with &s;uch fluency of op|probrious
language, that our hero &s;marting as
he was, and almo&s;t de&s;perate with his lo&s;s, de|viated
from that temperance of behaviour which
he had hitherto pre&s;erved, and &s;natching up the
poker, with one &s;troke opened a deep trench
upon the attorney's &s;kull, that extended from the
hind head, almo&s;t to the upper part of the no&s;e,
upon each &s;ide of which, it di&s;charged a &s;anguine
&s;tream. Notwith&s;tanding the pain of this appli|cation,
the &s;ollicitor was tran&s;ported with joy at
the &s;en&s;e of the &s;mart, and inwardly congratu|lated
him&s;elf upon the appearance of his own
blood, which he no &s;ooner perceived, than he
exclaimed, &startq;I'm a dead man,&endq; and fell upon
the floor at full length.</P>
<P>Immediate recour&s;e was had to a &s;urgeon in
the neighbourhood, who having examined the
wound, declared there was a dangerous depre&s;|&s;ion
of the fir&s;t table of the &s;kull, and that if
he could &s;ave the patient's life, without the ap|plication
of the trepan, it would be one of the
greate&s;t cures that ever were performed. By
this time, Fathom's fir&s;t tran&s;port being over|blown,
he &s;ummoned up his whole re&s;olution,
and reflected upon his own ruin, with that forti|tude
which had never failed him in the emergen|cies
of his fate: little di&s;turbed at the progno&s;tic
of the &s;urgeon, which he con&s;idered in the right
point of view; &startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I am not &s;o
unacquainted with the re&s;i&s;tance of an attorney's
&s;kull, as to believe the cha&s;ti&s;ement I have be|&s;towed
on him, will at all endanger his life,
which is in much greater jeopardy from the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
hands of the common executioner: for, not|with&s;tanding
this accident, I am determined to
pro&s;ecute the ra&s;cal for robbery, with the utmo&s;t
&s;everity of the law; and that I may have a &s;uf|ficient
fund left for that pro&s;ecution, I &s;hall not
at pre&s;ent throw away one farthing in unnece&s;|&s;ary
expence, but in&s;i&s;t upon being conveyed to
pri&s;on without farther delay.&endq;</P>
<P>This declaration was equally unwelcome to
the bailiff, &s;urgeon and &s;ollicitor, who upon the
&s;uppo&s;ition that the count was a per&s;on of for|tune,
and would rather part with an immen&s;e
&s;um, than incur the ignominy of a goal, or in|volve
him&s;elf in another di&s;graceful law-&s;uit, had
re&s;olved to fleece him to the utmo&s;t of their
power. But, now the attorney finding him de|termined
to &s;et his fate at defiance, and to retort
upon him a pro&s;ecution which he had no mind
to undergo, began to repent heartily of the pro|vocation
he had given, and to think &s;eriou&s;ly
on &s;ome method to overcome the ob&s;tinacy of
the incen&s;ed foreigner. With this view, while
the bailiff conducted him to bed, in another
apartment, he de&s;ired the catchpole to act the
part of mediator between him and the count,
and furni&s;hed him with proper in&s;tructions for
that purpo&s;e. Accordingly, the landlord on his
return, told Fathom that he was &s;ure the &s;olli|citor
was not a man for this world; for that he
had left him deprived of his &s;en&s;es, and praying
to God with great devotion, for mercy to his
murderer: he then exhorted him with may pro|te&s;tations
of friend&s;hip, to compromi&s;e the un|happy
affair by exchanging relea&s;es with the at|torney
before his delirium &s;hould be known,
otherwi&s;e he would bring him&s;elf into a mo&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="24">
dangerous premunire, whether the plaintiff &s;hould
die of his wound, or live to pro&s;ecute him for
the a&s;&s;ault: &startq;and with regard to your charge of
robbery again&s;t him, &s;aid he, as it is no more
than a bare &s;u&s;picion, un&s;upported by the lea&s;t
&s;hadow of evidence, the bill would be thrown
out, and then he might &s;ue you for damages. I
therefore, out of pure friend&s;hip and good na|ture
advi&s;e you to compromi&s;e the affair, and if
you think proper, will endeavour to bring about
a mutual relea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Our hero, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was by this time
pretty well cooled, &s;aw rea&s;on for a&s;&s;enting to
the propo&s;al; upon which the deed was imme|diately
executed, the mediator's bill was di&s;|charged;
and Ferdinand conveyed in an hack|ney
coach to pri&s;on, after he had impowered
his own landlord to di&s;charge his &s;ervants, and
convert his effects into ready money. Thus, he
&s;aw him&s;elf, in the cour&s;e of a few hours, de|prived
of his reputation, rank, liberty and friends;
and his fortune reduced from two thou&s;and
pounds, to &s;omething le&s;s than two hundred,
fifty of which he had carried to goal in his
pocket.</P>

<P>JUST as he entered the&s;e man&s;ions of mi&s;ery,
his ears were invaded with an hoar&s;e and
dreadful voice, exclaiming, &startq;You, Be&s;s Beetle,
&s;core a couple of fre&s;h eggs, a pennyworth of
butter, and half a pint of mountain to the king;

head with five pounds of potatoes for major
Macleaver's &s;upper, and let him have what drink
he wants; the fat widow gentlewoman from
Pimlico has promi&s;ed to quit his &s;core. Sir
Mungo Barebones may have &s;ome ha&s;ty pudding
and &s;mall beer, though I don't expect to &s;ee
his coin, no more than to receive the eighteen
pence I laid out for a pair of breeches to his
back&s;ide. What then? he's a quiet &s;ort of a
body, and a great &s;cholar, and it was a &s;candal
to the place, to &s;ee him going about in that
naked condition: as for the mad Frenchman
with the beard, if you give him &s;o much as a
chee&s;e-paring, you b&mdash;ch, I'll &s;end you back to
the hole, among your old companions; an im|pudent

What! I &s;uppo&s;e he thought he had to do with
a French hang-tang-dang, rabbit him! he &s;hall
eat his white feather before I give him credit
for a mor&s;el of bread.&endq;</P>
<P>Although our adventurer was very little di&s;|po&s;ed,
at this juncture, to make ob&s;ervations fo|reign
to his own affairs, he could not help taking
notice of the&s;e extraordinary injunctions; e&s;pe|cially
tho&s;e concerning the per&s;on who was in|titled
king, whom, however, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be
&s;ome pri&s;oner elected as the magi&s;trate by the
joint &s;uffrage of his fellows. Having taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his chamber, which he rented at
five &s;hillings a week, and being ill at ea&s;e in
his own thoughts, he forthwith &s;ecured his door,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
undre&s;&s;ed and went to bed, in which, though it
was none of the mo&s;t elegant or inviting couches,
he enjoyed profound repo&s;e after the accumulated
fatigues and mortifications of the day. Next
morning after breakfa&s;t, the keeper entered his
apartment, and gave him to under&s;tand, that the
gentlemen under his care, having heard of the
count's arrival, had deputed one of their num|ber
to wait upon him with the compliments of
condolance, &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and invite
him to become a member of their &s;ociety. Our
hero could not politely di&s;pen&s;e with this in&s;tance
of civility, and their amba&s;&s;ador being in&s;tantly
introduced by the name of captain Minikin, &s;aluted
him with great &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>This was a per&s;on equally remarkable for his
extraordinary figure and addre&s;s; his age &s;eemed
to border upon forty, his &s;tature amounted to
five feet, his vi&s;age was long, meagre and wea|ther-beaten,
and his a&s;pect, though not quite rue|ful,
exhibited a certain formality, which was the
re&s;ult of care and con&s;cious importance. He was
very little encumbred with fle&s;h and blood; yet,
what body he had, was well proportioned, his
l$mbs were elegantly turned, and by his carriage
he was well intitled to that compliment which
we pay to any per&s;on, when we &s;ay he has
very much the air of a gentleman. There was
al&s;o an evident &s;ingularity in his dre&s;s, which tho'
intended as an improvement, appeared to be an
extravagant exaggeration of the mode, and at
once evinced him an original to the di&s;cerning
eyes of our adventurer, who received him with
his u&s;ual complai&s;ance, and made a very eloquent
acknowledgment of the honour and &s;atisfaction
he received from the vi&s;it of the repre&s;entative,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
and the ho&s;pitality of his con&s;tituents. The
captain's peculiarities were not confined to his
external appearance; for his voice re&s;embled the
&s;ound of a ba&s;&s;oon, or the aggregate hum of a
whole bee-hive, and his di&s;cour&s;e was almo&s;t no|thing
el&s;e than a &s;eries of quotations from the Eng|li&s;h
poets, interlarded with French phra&s;es, which
he retained for their &s;ignificance, on the recom|mendation
of his friends, being him&s;elf unac|quainted
with that or any other outlandi&s;h
tongue.</P>
<P>Fathom finding this gentleman of a very com|municative
di&s;po&s;ition, thought he could not
have a fairer opportunity of learning the hi&s;tory

on that &s;ubject, was not di&s;appointed in
his expectation. &startq;I don't doubt, Sir,&endq; &s;aid he,
with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity of declamation, &startq;but
you look with horror upon every object that &s;ur|rounds
you in this uncomfortable place; but ne|verthele&s;s
here are &s;ome, who, as my friendShake|&s;pear
has it, <HI>have &s;een better days, and have with
holy bell been knolled to church; and &s;at at good
men's fea&s;ts, and wiped their eyes of drops that &s;a|cred
pity hath engendered.</HI> You mu&s;t know, Sir,
that exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Canaille,</HI> or the <HI>profanum
Vulgus,</HI> as they are &s;tiled by Horace, there are
&s;everal &s;mall communities in the goal, con&s;i&s;ting
of people who are attracted by the manners and
di&s;po&s;itions of each other: for this place, Sir,
is quite a <HI>microco&s;m,</HI> and as the great world, &s;o
is this a <HI>Stage, and all the men and women meerly
players.</HI> For my own part, Sir, I have always
made it a maxim to a&s;&s;ociate with the be&s;t com|pany
I can find: not that I pretend to boa&s;t of
my family or extraction; becau&s;e you know, as
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the poet &s;ays, <HI>Vix ea no&s;tra voco.</HI> My father,
'tis true, was a man that piqued him&s;elf upon
his pedigree, as well as upon his polite&s;&s;e and
per&s;onal merit; for he had been a very old offi|cer
in the army, and I my&s;elf may &s;ay, I was
born with a &s;pontoon in my hand. Sir, I have
had the honour to &s;erve his maje&s;ty the&s;e twenty
years, and have been bandied about in the cour&s;e
of duty, through all the Briti&s;h plantations, and
you &s;ee the recompence of all my &s;ervice. But
this is a di&s;agreeable &s;ubject, and therefore I &s;hall
wave it: however, as Butler ob&s;erves,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;My only comfort is that now,</L>
<L>My dubbolt fortune is &s;o low,</L>
<L>That either it mu&s;t quickly end,</L>
<L>Or turn about again and mend.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>And now to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, you
will perhaps be &s;urprized to hear that the head
or chairman of our club is really a &s;overeign
prince. No le&s;s I'll a&s;&s;ure you than the cele|brated
Theodore king of C-rf-ca, who lies in
pri&s;on for a debt of a few hundred pounds. <HI>Heu!
quantum mutatus ab illo.</HI> It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s
to cen&s;ure the conduct of my &s;uperiors: but I
always &s;peak my mind in a cavalier manner,
and, as according to the Spectator, talking to a
friend is no more than thinking aloud, <HI>entre nous,</HI>
his Corfican maje&s;ty has been &s;curvily treated by
a certain admini&s;tration: be that as it will, he
is a per&s;onage of a very portly appearance, and
is quite ma&s;ter of the <HI>bein&s;eance.</HI> Be&s;ides, they
will find it their intere&s;t to have recour&s;e again
to his alliance; and in that ca&s;e, &s;ome of us may
<PB N="28" REF="29">
expect to profit by his re&s;toration: but few words
are be&s;t.</P>
<P>He that maintains the &s;econd rank in our a&s;|&s;embly,
is one major Macleaver, an Iri&s;h gentle|man,
who has &s;erved abroad: a &s;oldier of for|tune,
Sir, a man of unque&s;tionable honour and
courage; but a little over-bearing, in con&s;e|quence
of his knowledge and experience. He
is a per&s;on of a good addre&s;s to be &s;ure, and
quite free of the <HI>mauvai&s;e honte;</HI> and he may
have &s;een a good deal of &s;ervice; but what then?
other people may be as good as he, though they
have not had &s;uch opportunities: if he &s;peaks
five or &s;ix languages, he does not pretend to any
ta&s;te in the liberal arts, which are the criterion
of an accompli&s;hed gentleman. The next is
Sir Mungo Barebones, the repre&s;entative of a
very ancient family in the North; his affairs are
very much <HI>derange&eacute;,</HI> but he is a gentleman of
great probity and learning, and at pre&s;ent engag'd
in a very grand &s;cheme, which, if he can bring
it to bear, will render him famous to all po&s;te|rity:
no le&s;s than the conver&s;ion of the Jews and
the Gentiles. The project, I own, looks chi|merical
to one who has not conver&s;ed with the
author; but, in my opinion, he has clearly de|mon&s;trated
from an anagrammatical analy&s;is of a
certain Hebrew word, that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty,
whom God pre&s;erve, is the per&s;on pointed at
in &s;cripture, as the temporal Me&s;&s;iah of the Jews;
and if he could once rai&s;e by &s;ub&s;cription, &s;uch a$
trifling &s;um as twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds,
I make no doubt but he would accompli&s;h his
aim, va&s;t and romantic as it &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, we have another me&s;&s;mate,
who is a French chevalier, an odd &s;ort of a man,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
a kind of Lazarillo de Tormes, a Caricatura;
he wears a long beard, pretends to be a great
poet, and makes a damned <HI>Fracas</HI> with his
ver&s;es. The king has been obliged to exert his
authority over him more than once, by order|ing
him into clo&s;e confinement, for which he
was &s;o ra&s;h as to &s;end his maje&s;ty a challenge;
but, he afterwards made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and was
again taken into favour: the truth is, I believe
his brain is a little di&s;ordered, and he being a
&s;tranger we overlook his extravagancies.</P>
<P>Sir, we &s;hall think our&s;elves happy in your
acce&s;&s;ion to our &s;ociety: you will be under no
&s;ort of re&s;traint: for though we dine at one
table, every individual calls and pays for his own
me&s;s. Our conver&s;ation, &s;uch as it is, will not,
I hope be di&s;agreeable; and though we have
not opportunities of breathing the pure Arca|dian
air, and cannot &startq;under the &s;hade of me|lancholy
boughs, lo&s;e and neglect the creeping
hours of time;&endq; we may enjoy our&s;elves over
a gla&s;s of punch or a di&s;h of tea: nor are we
de&s;titute of friends who vi&s;it us in the&s;e &s;hades
of di&s;tre&s;s. The major has a numerous ac|quaintance
of both &s;exes, among others, a fir&s;t
cou&s;in of good fortune, who with her daughters
often chear our &s;olitude; &s;he is a very &s;en&s;ible
lady-like gentlewoman, and the young ladies
have a certain <HI>degag&eacute;e</HI> air, that plainly &s;hews they
have &s;een the be&s;t company: be&s;ides, I will ven|ture
to recommend Mrs. Minikin, as a woman
of tolerable breeding and capacity, who I hope,
will not be found altogether deficient in the
accompli&s;hments of the &s;ex. So that we find
means to make little parties, in which the time
glides away in&s;en&s;ibly. Then I have a &s;mall col|lection
<PB N="30" REF="31">
of books, which are at your &s;ervice.
You may amu&s;e your&s;elf with Shake&s;pear, or
Milton, or Don Quixote, or any of our modern
authors that are worth reading, &s;uch as the ad|ventures
of Loveill, Lady Frail, George Ed|wards,
Joe Thomp&s;on, Bampfylde More Ca|rew,
Young Scarron, and Mi&s;s Bet&s;y Thought|le&s;s:
and if you have a ta&s;te for drawing, I can
entertain you with a parcel of prints by the be&s;t
ma&s;ters.&endq;</P>
<P>A man of our hero's politene&s;s, could not
help expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the warme&s;t terms of
gratitude for this courteous declaration. He
thanked the captain in particular for his obliging
offers, and begged he would be &s;o good as to
pre&s;ent his re&s;pects to the &s;ociety of which he
longed to be a member. It was determined
therefore, that Minikin &s;hould return in an
hour, when the count would be dre&s;&s;ed, in order
to conduct him into the pre&s;ence of his maje&s;ty;
and he had already taken his leave for the pre|&s;ent,
when all of a &s;udden he came back, and
taking hold of a wai&s;tcoat that lay upon a chair,
&startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;give me leave to look at that
fringe; I think it is the mo&s;t elegant knitting
I ever &s;aw: but pray Sir, are not the&s;e quite
out of fa&s;hion: I thought plain &s;ilk, &s;uch as
this that I wear, had been the mode; with the
pockets very low.&endq; Before Fathom had time
to make any &s;ort of reply, he took notice of
his hat and pumps; the fir&s;t of which he &s;aid
was too narrow in the brims, and the la&s;t an
inch too low in the heels; indeed they formed
a remarkable contra&s;t with his own: for, ex|clu&s;ive
of the fa&s;hion of the cock, which re&s;em|bled
the form of a Roman galley, the brim of
<PB N="31" REF="32">
his hat, if properly &s;pread, would have projected
a &s;hade &s;ufficient to &s;helter a whole file of mu&s;|queteers
from the heat of a &s;ummer's &s;un; and
the heels of his &s;hoes were &s;o high as to rai&s;e
his feet three inches at lea&s;t, from the &s;urface of
the earth.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e ob&s;ervations for the credit
of his ta&s;te, he retired, and returning at the
time appointed, accompanied Ferdinand to the
apartment of the king, at the door of which,
their ears were invaded with a &s;trange &s;ound, be|ing
that of an human voice imitating the noi&s;e of a
drum. The captain hearing this alarm, made a
full &s;top, and giving the count to under&s;tand that
his maje&s;ty was bu&s;y, begged he would not take
it ami&s;s, if the introduction &s;hould be delayed
for a few moments. Fathom curious to know
the meaning of what he had heard, applied to
his guide for information, and learned that the
king and the major, whom he had nominated to
the po&s;t of his general in chief, were employed
in landing troops upon the Genoe&s;e territory:
that is, that they were &s;ettling before-hand, the
manner of their di&s;embarkation.</P>
<P>He then, by the direction of his conductor,
reconnoitred them through the key-hole, and
perceived the &s;overeign and his mini&s;ter &s;itting
on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of a deal board table, covered
with a large chart or map, upon which he &s;aw
a great number of mu&s;cle and o$&s;ter-&s;hells,
ranged in a certain order, and at a little di&s;tance,
&s;everal regular &s;quares and columns made of
cards cut in &s;mall pieces. The prince him&s;elf,
who&s;e eyes were reinforced by &s;pectacles, &s;ur|veyed
this armament with great attention, while
the general put the whole in action, and con|ducted
<PB N="32" REF="33">
their motions by beat of drum. The
mu&s;cle-&s;hells, according to Minikin's explanation,
repre&s;ented the tran&s;ports, the oy&s;ter-&s;hells were
con&s;idered as the men of war that covered the
troops in landing, and the pieces of card exhi|bited
the different bodies into which the army
was formed upon its di&s;embarkation.</P>
<P>As an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence could not
be tran&s;acted without oppo&s;ition, they had pro|vided
divers ambu&s;cades, con&s;i&s;ting of the enemy,
whom they repre&s;ented by grey pea&s;e; and ac|cordingly,
general Macleaver perceiving the &s;aid
grey pea&s;e marching along &s;hore, to attack his
forces before they could be drawn up in battalia,
thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the oy&s;ter-&s;hells in an
audible voice: &startq;You men of war, don't you
&s;ee the front of the enemy advancing, and the
re&s;t of the detachment following out of &s;ight?
Arrah! the Devil burn you, why don't you
come a&s;hore and open your batteries?&endq; So &s;ay|ing,
he pu&s;hed the &s;hells towards the breach,
performed the cannonading with his voice, the
grey pea&s;e were &s;oon put in confu&s;ion, the ge|neral
was beat, the cards marched forwards
in order of battle, and the enemy having
retreated with great precipitation, they took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ground without farther dif|culty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He contemplates maje&s;ty and its &s;atellites in
eclip&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THIS expedition being happily fini&s;hed, ge|neral
Macleaver put the whole army,
navy, tran&s;ports and &s;cene of action into a can|vas
bag, the prince un&s;addled his no&s;e, and cap|tain
Minikin being admitted, our hero was
introduced in form. Very gracious was the re|ception
he met with from his maje&s;ty, who with
a mo&s;t princely demeanour, welcomed him to
court, and even &s;eated him on his right hand,
in token of particular regard. True it is, this
pre&s;ence-chamber was not &s;o &s;uperb, nor the ap|pearance
of the king &s;o magnificent as to render
&s;uch an honour intoxicating to any per&s;on of our
hero's coolne&s;s and di&s;cretion: in lieu of tape&s;|try
the apartment was hung with half-penny
ballads, a truckle-bed without curtains, &s;upplied
the place of a canopy, and in&s;tead of a crown,
his maje&s;ty wore a woolen night-cap. Yet, in
&s;pite of the&s;e di&s;advantages, there was an air of
dignity in his deportment, and a nice phy&s;iog|noni&s;t
would have perceived &s;omething maje&s;tic
in the features of his countenance.</P>
<P>He was certainly a per&s;onage of a very pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
mien, his manners were engaging;
his conver&s;ation agreeable, and any man who&s;e
heart was &s;ubject to the meltings of humanity,
would have deplored his di&s;tre&s;s, and looked
upon him as a mo&s;t pathetic in&s;tance of that
mi&s;erable rever&s;e, to which all human grandeur
is expo&s;ed. His fall was even greater than that
<PB N="34" REF="35">
of Beli&s;arius, who after having obtained many
glorious victories over the enemies of his coun|try,
is &s;aid to have been reduced to &s;uch extre|mity
of indigence, that in his old age, when he
was deprived of his eye-&s;ight, he &s;at upon the
high-way like a common mendicant, imploring
the charity of pa&s;&s;engers, in the piteous excla|mation
of <HI>Date obolum Beli&s;ario;</HI> that is, &startq;Spare
a farthing to your poor old &s;oldier Beli&s;arius.&endq; I
&s;ay, this general's di&s;grace was not &s;o remark|able
as that of Theodore, becau&s;e he was the
&s;ervant of Ju&s;tinian, con&s;equently his fortune
depended upon the nod of that emperor; whereas
the other actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne of &s;ove|reignty
by the be&s;t of all titles, namely, the
unanimous election of the people over whom he
reigned; and attracted the eyes of all Europe,
by the efforts he made in breaking the bands of
oppre&s;&s;ion, and vindicating that liberty which is
the birthright of man.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h of former days, alike renowned
for genero&s;ity and valour, treated tho&s;e ho&s;tile
princes who&s;e fate it was to wear their chains,
with &s;uch delicacy of benevolence, as even di&s;|pelled
the horrors of captivity; but, their po&s;te|rity
of this refined age, feel no compunction at
&s;eeing an unfortunate monarch, their former
friend, ally and partizan, langui&s;h amid&s;t the
mi&s;eries of a loath&s;ome gaol, for a paultry debt
contracted in their own &s;ervice. But moralizing
apart, our hero had not long conver&s;ed with this
extraordinary debtor, who in his pre&s;ent condi|tion,
a&s;&s;umed no other title than that of Baron,
than he perceived in him a &s;pirit of Quixoti&s;m,
which all his experience, together with the vici&s;|&s;itudes
of his fortune, had not been able to over|come,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
not that his ideas &s;oared to &s;uch a pitch
of extravagant hope as that which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his me&s;s-mates, who frequently quarrelled
one with another, about the degrees of favour
to which they &s;hould be intitled after the king's
re&s;toration; but he firmly believed that affairs
would &s;peedily take &s;uch a turn in Italy, as
would point out to the Engli&s;h court, the expe|diency
of employing him again; and this per&s;ua|&s;ion
&s;eemed to &s;upport him again&s;t every &s;pecies
of poverty and mortification.</P>
<P>While they were bu&s;y in trimming the balance
of power on the other &s;ide of the Alps, their
deliberations were interrupted by the arrival of a
&s;cullion, who came to receive their orders touch|ing
the bill of fare for dinner, and his maje&s;ty
&s;ound much more difficulty in &s;ettling this im|portant
concern, than in compromi&s;ing all the
differences between the emperor and the queen
of Spain. At length, however, General Mac|leaver
undertook the office of purveyor for his
prince; captain Minikin in&s;i&s;ted upon treating
the count, and in a little time the table was co|vered
with a cloth, which for the &s;ake of my
delicate readers, I &s;hall not attempt to de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>At this period, they were joined by Sir Mungo
Barebones, who having found means to pur|cha&s;e
a couple of mutton chops, had cooked a
me&s;s of broth, which he now brought in a &s;auce|pan
to the general rendezvous: this was the
mo&s;t remarkable object which had hitherto pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf to the eyes of Fathom: being natu|rally
of a meagre habit, he was by indigence
and hard &s;tudy wore almo&s;t to the bone, and &s;o
bended towards the earth, that in walking, his
<PB N="36" REF="37">
body de&s;cribed at lea&s;t 150 degrees of a circle.
The want of &s;tockings and &s;hoes he &s;upplied
with a jockey &s;traight boot and an half jack.
His thighs and middle were ca&s;ed in a mon&s;trous
pair of brown trunk breeches, which the keeper
bought for his u&s;e, from the executor of a Dutch
&s;eamen who had lately died in the jail: his &s;hirt
retained no &s;igns of its original colour, his body
was &s;hrouded in an old grea&s;y tattered plaid night|gown;
a blue and white handkerchief &s;ur|rounded
his head, and his looks betokened that
immen&s;e load of care, which he had voluntarily
incurred for the eternal &s;alvation of &s;inners. Yet
this figure, uncouth as it was, made his com|pliments
to our adventurer in terms of the mo&s;t
elegant addre&s;s, and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;a|tion,
di&s;clo&s;ed a great fund of valuable know|ledge.
He had appeared in the great world,
and bore divers offices of dignity and tru&s;t, with
univer&s;al applau&s;e: his courage was undoubted,
his morals were unimpeached, and his per&s;on
held in great veneration and e&s;teem; when his
evil genius engaged him in the &s;tudy of Hebrew,
and the my&s;teries of the Jewi&s;h religion, which
fairly di&s;ordered his brain, and rendered him in|capable
of managing his temporal affairs. When
he ought to have been employed in the functions
of his po&s;t, he was always rapt in vi&s;ionary
conferences with Mo&s;es on the Mount; rather
than regulate the oeconomy of his hou&s;hold,
he cho&s;e to exert his endeavours in &s;ettling the pre|ci&s;e
meaning of the word <HI>Elohim;</HI> and having di&s;|covered
that now the period was come, when the
Jews and Gentiles would be converted, he po&s;t|poned
every other con&s;ideration, in order to fa|cilitate
that great and glorious event.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
By this time, Ferdinand had &s;een every
member of the club, except the French cheva|lier,
who &s;eemed to be quite neglected by the
&s;ociety; for his name was not once mentioned
during this communication, and they &s;at down
to dinner, without a&s;king whether he was dead
or alive. The king regaled him&s;elf with a plate
of ox-cheek; the major, who complained that
his appetite had for&s;aken him, amu&s;ed him&s;elf
with &s;ome forty hard eggs, malaxed with &s;alt but|ter;
the knight indulged upon his &s;oup and
bouill&eacute;, and the captain entertained our adven|turer
with a neck of veal ro$&s;ted, with potatoes;
but before Fathom could make u&s;e of his knife
and fork, he was &s;ummoned to the door, where
he found the chevalier in great agitation, his
eyes &s;parkling like coals of fire.</P>
<P>Our hero was not a little &s;urprized at this
apparition, who having asked pardon for the
freedom he had u&s;ed, ob&s;erved, that under&s;tand|ing
the count was a foreigner, he could not di&s;|pen&s;e
with appealing to him, concerning an
outrage he had &s;uffered from the keeper, who,
without any regard to his rank or misfortunes,
had been ba&s;e enough to refu&s;e him credit for a
few nece&s;&s;aries, until he could have a remittance
from his &s;teward in France; he therefore con|jured
count Fathom, as a &s;tranger and noble|man
like him&s;elf, to be the me&s;&s;enger of defi|ance,
which he re&s;olved to &s;end to that brutal
gaoler, that for the future he might learn to
make proper di&s;tinctions in the exerci&s;e of his
function.</P>
<P>Fathom, who had no inclination to offend this
choleric Frenchman, a&s;&s;ured him that he might
depend upon his friend&s;hip; and in the mean
<PB N="38" REF="39">
time, prevai&s;ed upon him to accept of a &s;mall
&s;upply, in con&s;equence of which, he procured a
pound of &s;au&s;ages, and joined the re&s;t of the
company without delay; making a very &s;uitable
addition to &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of rarities. Tho'
his age did not exceed thirty years, his beard,
which was of a brindled hue, flowed down, like
Aaron's, to his middle: upon his legs he wore
red &s;tockings rolled up over the joint of the knee,
his breeches were of blue drab with vellum
button-holes, and garters of gold lace, his wai&s;t|coat
of &s;carlet, his coat of ru&s;ty black cloath,
his hair twi&s;ted into a ramellie, hung down to
his rump, of the colour of jet, and his hat was
adorned with a white feather.</P>
<P>This original had formed many ingenious
&s;chemes to increa&s;e the glory and grandeur of
France, but was di&s;couraged by cardinal Fleury,
who, in all appearance, jealous of his great ta|lents,
not only rejected his projects, but even &s;ent
him to pri&s;on, on pretence of being offended at
his impertinence. Perceiving that, like the
prophet, he had no honour in his own country,
he no &s;ooner obtained his relea&s;e, than he re|tired
to England, where he was prompted by
his philanthropy, to propo&s;e an expedient to our
mini&s;try, which would have &s;aved a va&s;t effu|&s;ion
of blood and trea&s;ure; this was an agree|ment
between the queen of Hungary and the
late emperor, to decide their preten&s;ions by a
&s;ingle combat; in which ca&s;e he offered him|&s;elf
as the Bavarian champion; but in this en|deavour
he al&s;o proved un&s;ucce&s;sful: then turn|ing
his attention to the delights of poetry, he
became &s;o enamoured of the mu&s;e, that he neg|lected
every other con&s;ideration, and &s;he as u&s;ual,
<PB N="39" REF="40">

<HEAD TYPE="sub">One quarrel is compromi&s;ed; and another decided
by unu&s;ual arms.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG other topics of conver&s;ation that
were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at this genial meeting, Sir
Mungo's &s;cheme was brought upon the carpet,
by his maje&s;ty, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to
a&s;k how his &s;ub&s;cription filled? To this interroga|tion,
the knight an&s;wered, that he met with
great oppo&s;ition from a &s;pirit of levity and &s;elf|conceit,
which &s;eemed to prevail in this genera|tion;
but, that no difficulties &s;hould di&s;courage
him, from per&s;evering in his duty; and he tru&s;t|ed
in God, that in a very little time he &s;hould
be able to confute and overthrow the fal&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy
of the moderns, and to re&s;tore the
writings of Mo&s;es to that pre-heminence and ve|neration,
which is due to an in&s;pired author.
He &s;poke of the immortal Newton with infinite
contempt, and undertook to extract from the
Pentateuch, a &s;y&s;tem of chronology, which
would a&s;certain the progre&s;s of time &s;ince the
fourth day of the creation to the pre&s;ent hour
with &s;uch exactne&s;s, that not one vibration of a
pendulum &s;hould be lo&s;t! nay, he affirmed that
the perfection of all arts and &s;ciences might be
attained by &s;tudying tho&s;e &s;acred memoirs; and
that he him&s;elf did not de&s;pair off earning from
<PB N="40" REF="41">
them the art of tran&s;muting ba&s;er metals into
gold.</P>
<P>The chevalier, though he did not pretend to
contradict the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, was too much attach|ed
to his own religion to acquie&s;ce in the knight's
project of converting the Jews and the Gentiles
to the prote&s;tant here&s;y, which, he &s;aid, God
Almighty would never &s;uffer to triumph over the
intere&s;ts of his own holy catholic church. This
objection produced abundance of altercation be|tween
two very unequal di&s;putants, and the
Frenchman fin$ing him&s;elf puzzled by the learn|ing
of his antagoni&s;t, had recour&s;e to the <HI>Argu|mentum
ad hominem,</HI> by laying his hand upon his
&s;word, and declaring that he was ready to lo&s;e
the la&s;t drop of his blood in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch
a damnable &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Sir Mungo, though in all appearance, reduced
to the la&s;t &s;tage of animal exi&s;tence, no &s;ooner
heard this epithet applied to his plan, than his
eyes gleamed like lightning; he &s;prung from his
&s;eat, with the agility of a gra&s;s-hopper, and
darting him&s;elf out at the door, like an arrow
from a bow, re-appeared in a moment with a
long ru&s;ty weapon, which might have been &s;hewn
among a collection of rarities, as the &s;word of
Guy ea$l of Warwick. This implement he
brandi&s;hed over the chevalier's head, with the
dexterity of an old prize-fighter, exclaiming in
the French language, &startq;Thou art a prophane
wretch marked out for the vengeance of Hea|ven,
who&s;e unworthy mini&s;ter I am; and here
thou &s;halt fall by the &s;word of the Lord and of
Gideon.&endq;</P>
<P>The chevalier, unterrified by this dreadful &s;a|lutation,
de&s;ired he would accompany him to a
<PB N="41" REF="42">
more convenient place; and the world might
have been deprived of one or both the&s;e knights-errant,
had not general Macleaver, at the de&s;ire
of his maje&s;ty, interpo&s;ed, and &s;ound means to
bring matters to an accommodation.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the &s;ociety was vi&s;ited by
the major's cou&s;in and her daughters, who no
&s;ooner appeared, than they were recognized by
our adventurer; and his acquaintance with them
renewed in &s;uch a manner as alarmed the deli|cacy
of captain Minikin, who in the evening,
repaired to the count's apartment, and with a
very formal phy&s;iognomy, acco&s;ted him in the&s;e
words. &startq;Sir, I beg pardon for this intru&s;ion;
but, I come to con&s;ult you about an affair in
which my honour is concerned: and a &s;oldier
without honour, you know is no better than a
body without a &s;oul. I have always admired
that &s;peech of Hot&s;pur, in the fir&s;t part of
Henry the fourth.</P>
<LG>
<L>&startq;By Heaven, methinks it were an ea&s;y leap,</L>
<L>To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd
moon;</L>
<L>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</L>
<L>Wherefathom line could never touch the ground,</L>
<L>And pluck up drowned honour by the locks.&mdash;&endq;</L>
</LG>
<P>There is a boldne&s;s and ea&s;e in the expre&s;&s;ion,
and the images are very pictore&s;que. But, with|out
any further preamble; pray Sir, give me
leave to ask how long you have been acquainted
with tho&s;e ladies, who drank tea with us this
afternoon? You'll forgive the que&s;tion Sir,
when I tell you that major Macleaver intro|duced
Mrs. Minikin to them, as to ladies of
character; and I don't know how Sir, I have a
<PB N="42" REF="43">
&s;ort of <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> that my wife has been impo&s;|ed
upon. Perhaps I may be mi&s;taken, and
God grant I may. But there was a <HI>je ne &s;$ai quoy</HI>
in their behaviour to-day, which begins to alarm
my &s;u&s;picion. Sir, I have nothing but my repu|tation
to depend upon; and I hope you will ex|cu&s;e
me, when I earne&s;tly beg to know what
rank they maintain in life.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom, without minding the con&s;equence,
told him with a &s;imper, that he knew them to
be very good-natured ladies, who devoted them|&s;elves
to the happine&s;s of mankind. This ex|planation
had no &s;ooner e&s;caped from his lips,
than the captain's face began to glow with in|dignation,
his eyes &s;eemed bur&s;ting from their
&s;pheres, he &s;welled to twice his natural dimen|&s;ions,
and rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his tiptoes, pro|nounced
in a &s;train that emulated thunder.
&startq;Blood! Sir, you &s;eem to make very light of
the matter; but it is no joke to me, I'll a&s;&s;ure
you: and Macleaver &s;hall &s;ee that I am not to
be affronted with impunity. Sir, I &s;hall take it
as a &s;ingular favour, if you will be the bearer of
a billet to him, which I &s;hall write in three
words: nay, Sir, you mu&s;t give me leave to
in&s;i&s;t upon it, as you are the only gentleman of
our me&s;s, whom I can intru&s;t with an affair of
this nature.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom, rather than run the ri&s;que of di&s;ob|liging
&s;uch a punctilious warrior, after having
in vain attempted to di&s;&s;uade him from his pur|po&s;e,
undertook to carry the challenge, which
was immediately penned in the&s;e words.</P>

therefore demand &s;uch &s;atisfaction as a &s;oldier

</LETTER>
<P>This mor&ccedil;eau being &s;ealed and directed, was
forthwith carried by our adventurer to the lodg|ings
of the major, who had by this time, re|tired
to re&s;t, but hearing the count's voice, he got
up and opened the door in <HI>cuerpo,</HI> to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of Ferdinand, who had never before
&s;een &s;uch an Herculean figure. He made an
apology for receiving the count in his birth-day
&s;uit, to which, he &s;aid, he was reduced by the
heat of his con&s;titution, though he might have
a&s;&s;igned a more adequate cau&s;e, by owning that
his &s;hirt was in the hands of his wa&s;herwoman;
then &s;hrouding him&s;elf in a blanket, de&s;ired to
know what had procured him the honour of
&s;uch an extraordinary vi&s;it. He read the letter
with great compo&s;ure, like a man accu&s;tomed to
&s;uch intercour&s;e; then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the
bearer, &startq;I will be after diverting the gentleman,
&s;aid he, in any manner he &s;hall think proper:
but by Je&s;us! this is no place for &s;uch amu&s;e|ments;
becau&s;e, as you well know, my dear
count, if both &s;hould be killed by the chance of
war, neither of us will be able to e&s;cape, and
<PB N="44" REF="45">
after the breath is out of his body, he will make
but a &s;orry excu&s;e to his family and friends. But,
that is no concern of mine, and therefore I am
ready to plea&s;e him in his own way.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom approved of his remarks, which he
reinforced with &s;undry con&s;iderations to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e, and begged the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the major's
advice, in finding &s;ome expedient to terminate
the affair without blood&s;hed, that no trouble|&s;ome
con&s;equences might en&s;ue either to him or
to his antagoni&s;t, who in &s;pite of this over-&s;train|ed
formality, &s;eemed to be a per&s;on of worth
and good-nature. &startq;With all my heart, &s;aid
the generous Hibernian, I have a great regard
for the little man, and my own character is not
to &s;eek at this time of day. I have &s;erved a long
apprentice&s;hip to fighting, as this &s;ame carca&s;s
can te&s;tify, and if he compels me to run him
through the body, by my &s;houl I &s;hall do it in
a friendly manner.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he threw a&s;ide the blanket, and
di&s;played &s;cars and &s;eams innumerable upon his
body, which appeared like an old patched leathern
doublet. &startq;I remember, proceeded this cham|pion,
when I was a &s;lave at Algiers, Murphy
Macmorris and I happened to have &s;ome diffe|rence
in the bagnio; upon which he bad me
turn out. Arra, for what? &s;aid I, here
are no weapons that a gentleman can u&s;e, and
you would not be &s;uch a negro as to box like
an Engli&s;h carman. After he had puzzled him|&s;elf
for &s;ome time, he propo&s;ed that we &s;hould
retire into a corner, and funk one another with
brim&s;tone, 'till one of us &s;hould give out. Ac|cordingly
we crammed half a dozen of tobacco|pipes
with &s;ulphur, and &s;etting foot to foot, be|gan
<PB N="45" REF="46">
to &s;moke, and kept a con&s;tant fire, until
Macmorris dropped down; then I threw away
my pipe, and taking poor Murphy in my arms,
&startq;What are you dead,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;if you are dead,
&s;peak.&endq; &startq;No by Je&s;us! cried he, I an't dead,
but I'm &s;peechle&s;s.&endq; So he owned, I had ob|tained
the victory, and we were as good friends
as ever. Now if Mr. Minikin thinks proper to
put the affair upon the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue, I will &s;moke
a pipe of brim&s;tone with him to-morrow morn|ing,
and if I cry out fir&s;t, I will be after a&s;king
pardon for this &s;uppo&s;ed affront.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom could not help laughing at the propo|&s;al,
to which, however, he objected on account
of Minikin's delicate con&s;titution, which might
&s;uffer more detriment from breathing in an at|mo&s;phere
of &s;ulphur, than from the di&s;charge of
a pi&s;tol, or the thru&s;t of a &s;mall &s;word. He
therefore &s;ugge&s;ted another expedient in lieu of
the &s;ulphur, namely, the gum called <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida,</HI>
which though abundantly nau&s;eous, could have
no dangerous effect upon the infirm texture of
the lieutenant's lungs. This hint being reli&s;hed
by the major, our adventurer returned to his
principal, and having repeated the other's argu|ments
again&s;t the u&s;e of mortal in&s;truments, de|&s;cribed
the &s;uccedaneum, which he had concerted
with Macleaver. The captain at fir&s;t believed
this &s;cheme was calculated for &s;ubjecting him to
the ridicule of his fellow-pri&s;oners, and began
to &s;torm with great violence; but by the a&s;&s;u|rances
and addre&s;s of Fathom, he was at length
reconciled to the plan, and preparations were
made on each &s;ide for this duel, which was actu|ally
&s;moaked next day, about noon, in a &s;mall
clo&s;et, detached from the challenger's apartment,
<PB N="46" REF="47">
and within hearing of his maje&s;ty and all his
court, a&s;&s;embled as witne&s;&s;es and umpires of the
conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The combatants being locked up together,
began to ply their engines with great fury, and
it was not long before captain Minikin perceived
he had a manife&s;t advantage over his antagoni&s;t.
For his organs were familiarized to the effluvia
of this drug, which he had frequently u&s;ed in the
cour&s;e of an hypochondriac di&s;order; whereas
Macleaver, who was a &s;tranger to all &s;orts of me|dicine,
by his wry faces and attempts to puke,
expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t abhorrence of the &s;mell that
invaded his no&s;trils. Neverthele&s;s, re&s;olved to
hold out to the la&s;t extremity, he continued in
action, until the clo&s;et was filled with &s;uch an
intolerable vapour as di&s;compo&s;ed the whole
oeconomy of his intrails, and compelled him to
di&s;gorge his breakfa&s;t in the face of his opponent,
who&s;e nerves were &s;o di&s;concerted by this di&s;|agreeable
and unfore&s;een di&s;charge, that he fell
back into his chair in a &s;woon, and the major
bellowed aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The door being
opened, he ran directly to a window, to inhale
the fre&s;h air, while the captain recovering from
his fit, complained of Macleaver's unfair pro|ceedings,
and demanded ju&s;tice of the arbitrators,
who decided in his favour; and the major being
prevailed upon to a&s;k pardon for having intro|duced
Mrs. Minikin to women of rotten repu|tation,
the parties were reconciled to each other,
and peace and concord re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the me&s;s.</P>
<P>Fathom acquired univer&s;al applau&s;e for his
di&s;creet and humane conduct upon this occa&s;ion;
and that &s;ame afternoon had an opportunity of
&s;eeing the lady in who&s;e cau&s;e he had exerted
<PB N="47" REF="48">
him&s;elf. He was pre&s;ented to her as the hu&s;band's
particular friend, and when &s;he under&s;tood how
much &s;he was indebted to his care and concern
for the captain's &s;afety, &s;he treated him with
uncommon marks of di&s;tinction; and he found
her a genteel well-bred woman, not without a
good &s;hare of per&s;onal charms, and a well culti|vated
under&s;tanding.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An unexpected rencounter, and an happy revolution
in the affairs of our adventurer.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;he did not lodge within the precincts of
this garri&s;on, &s;he was one day, after tea,
conducted to the gate by the captain and the
count, and ju&s;t as they approached the turnkey's
lodge, our hero's eyes were &s;truck with the ap|parition
of his old companion Renaldo, &s;on of
his benefactor and patron the count de Melvile.
What were the emotions of his &s;oul, when he
&s;aw that young gentleman enter the pri&s;on, and
advance towards him, after having &s;poke to the
gaoler! He never doubted that being informed
of his confinement, he was come to upbraid
him with his villainy and ingratitude, and he
in vain endeavoured to recollect him&s;elf from
that terror and guilty confu&s;ion which his ap|pearance
had in&s;pired; when the &s;tranger lifting
up his eyes, &s;tarted back with &s;igns of extreme
amazement, and after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, ex|claimed,
&startq;Heaven and earth! Sure my eyes do
not deceive me! is not your name Fathom? it is,
it mu&s;t be my old friend and companion, the lo&s;s
of whom I have &s;o long regreted!&endq; With
<PB N="48" REF="49">
the&s;e words, he ran towards our adventurer, and
while he cla&s;ped him in his arms, with all the
eagerne&s;s of affection, prote&s;ted that this was
one of the happie&s;t days he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, who from this &s;alutation, con|cluded
him&s;elf &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Renaldo's
good opinion, was not deficient in expre&s;&s;ions
of tenderne&s;s and joy; he returned his embraces
with equal ardour, the tears trickled down his
cheeks, and that perturbation which proceeded
from con&s;cious perfidy and fear, was mi&s;taken
by the un&s;u&s;pecting Hungarian for the &s;heer ef|fects
of love, gratitude and &s;urprize. The&s;e
fir&s;t tran&s;ports having &s;ub&s;ided, they adjourned
to the lodgings of Fathom, who &s;oon recollected
his &s;pirits and invention &s;o well as to amu&s;e the
other with a feigned tale of his having been taken
by the French, &s;ent pri&s;oner into Champaigne,
from whence he had written many letters to
count Melvile and his &s;on, of whom he could
hear no tidings; of his having contracted an
intimacy with a young nobleman of France,
who died in the flower of his age, after having
in token of friend&s;hip, bequeathed to him a
con&s;iderable legacy; by this he had been ena|bled
to vi&s;it the land of his forefathers in the
character of a gentleman, which he had &s;up|ported
with &s;ome figure, until he was betrayed
into a misfortune that exhau&s;ted his funds, and
drove him to the &s;pot where he was now found:
and he &s;olemnly declared, that far from forget|ing
the obligation he owed to count Melvile, or
renouncing the friend&s;hip of Renaldo, he had
actually re&s;olved to &s;et out for Germany on
his return to the hou&s;e of his patron in the be|ginning
of the week, po&s;terior to that in which
he had been arre&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
Young Melvil, who&s;e own heart had never
known the in&s;tigations of fraud, implicitely be|lieved
the &s;tory and prote&s;tations of Fathom; and
tho' he would not ju&s;tify that part of his conduct
by which the term of his good fortune was
abridged, he could not help excu&s;ing an indi&s;cre|tion
into which he had been hurried by the pre|cipitancy
of youth, and the allurements of an art|ful
woman: nay, with the utmo&s;t warmth of
friend&s;hip, he undertook to wait upon Trapwell,
and endeavour to &s;often him into &s;ome rea&s;onable
terms of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Fathom &s;eemed to be quite overwhelmed with
a deep &s;en&s;e of all this goodne&s;s, and affected the
mo&s;t eager impatience to know the particulars of
Renaldo's fate, &s;ince their unhappy &s;eparation,
more e&s;pecially his errand to this uncomfortable
place which he &s;hould henceforth revere as the
providential &s;cene of their reunion: nor did he
forget to enquire, in the mo&s;t affectionate and
dutiful manner, about the &s;ituation of his noble
parents and amiable &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>At mention of the&s;e names, Renaldo, fetching
a deep &s;igh, &startq;Alas! my friend, (&s;aid $word$) the
Count is no more; and what aggravates my af|fliction
for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a father, it was my
misfortune to be under his di&s;plea&s;ure at the time
of his death. Had I been pre&s;ent on that melan|choly
occa&s;ion. &s;o well I knew his genero&s;ity and
paternal tenderne&s;s, that &s;ure I am, he would in
his la&s;t moments have forgiven an only &s;on who&s;e
life had been a continual effort to render him&s;elf
worthy of &s;uch a parent, and who&s;e crime was
no other than an honourable pa&s;&s;ion for the mo&s;t
meritorious of her &s;ex. But I was removed at a
fatal di&s;tance from him, and doubtle&s;s my conduct
<PB REF="51">
mu&s;t have been invidiou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented. Be
that as it will, my mother has again given her
hand in wedlock to Count Treva&s;i; by whom
I have the mortification to be informed that I am
totally excluded from my father's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and
I learn from other quarters, that my &s;i&s;ter is bar|barou&s;ly
treated by this inhuman father-in-law.
Grant, Heaven, I may &s;oon have an opportunity of
expo&s;tulating with the tyrant upon that &s;ubject.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes
lightened with re&s;entment. Then he thus pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>&startq;My coming hither to-day, was with a view
to vi&s;it a poor female relation, from whom I ye&s;|terday
received a letter de&s;cribing her mo&s;t deplo|rable
&s;ituation, and &s;olliciting my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but
the turnkey affirms, that there is no &s;uch per&s;on
in the jail; and I was on my way to con&s;ult the
keeper, when I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with the
&s;ight of my dear Fathom.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer having wiped from his eyes the
tears which were produced by the news of his
worthy patron's death, de&s;ired to know the name
of that afflicted pri&s;oner in who&s;e behalf he inte|re&s;ted
him&s;elf &s;o much, and Renaldo produced the
letter, &s;ub&s;cribed your unfortunate cou&s;in Helen
Melvil. This pretended relation, after having ex|plained
the degree of con&s;anguinity which &s;he and
the Count &s;tood in to each other, and occa&s;ionally
mentioned &s;ome anecdotes of the family in Scot|land,
gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;he had married
a merchant of London, who, by repeated lo&s;&s;es in
trade, had been reduced to indigence, and after|wards
confined in pri&s;on, where he then lay a
breathle&s;s coar&s;e, having left her in the utmo&s;t
extremity of wretchedne&s;s and want, with two
<PB N="51" REF="52">
young children in the &s;mall-pox, and an incura|ble
cancer in one of her own brea&s;ts. Indeed,
the picture &s;he drew was &s;o moving, and her ex|pre&s;&s;ions
&s;o &s;en&s;ibly pathetic, that no per&s;on who&s;e
heart was not altogether callous, could peru&s;e it
without emotion. Renaldo had &s;ent two guineas
by the me&s;&s;enger whom &s;he had repre&s;ented as a
tru&s;ty &s;ervant, who&s;e fidelity had been proof a|gain&s;t
all the di&s;tre&s;s of her mi&s;tre&s;s: and he was
now arrived, in order to reinforce his bounty.</P>
<P>Fathom, in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own prac|tices,
immediately comprehended the &s;cheme of
this letter, and con&s;idently a&s;&s;ured him, that no
&s;uch per&s;on re&s;ided in the pri&s;on, or in any other
place: and when his friend applied for informa|tion
to the keeper, the&s;e a&s;&s;urances were con|firmed;
and that &s;tern janitor told him, he had
been impo&s;ed upon by a &s;tale trick which was
often practi&s;ed upon &s;trangers, by a &s;et of &s;harp|ers,
who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to pick up hints
of intelligence relating to private families, upon
which they build &s;uch &s;uper&s;tructures of fraud and
impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>However piqued the young Hungarian might
be to find him&s;elf duped in this manner, he re|joiced
at the occa&s;ion which had thrown Fathom
in his way; and, after having made him a tender
of his pur&s;e, took his leave, on purpo&s;e to wait
upon Trapwell, who was not quite &s;o untractable
as an enraged cuckold commonly is; for, by this
time, he had accompli&s;hed the be&s;t part of his
aim, which was to be divorced from his wife,
and was fully convinced that the defendant was
no more than a needy adventurer, who in all pro|bability
would be relea&s;ed by an act of parlia|ment
for the benefit of in&s;olvent debtors; in
<PB N="52" REF="53">
which ca&s;e, he (the plaintiff) would reap no
&s;olid advantage from his impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>He therefore li&s;tened to the remon&s;trances of
the mediator, and after much canva&s;&s;ing agreed
to di&s;charge the defendant in con&s;ideration of two
hundred pounds, which were immediately paid
by Count Melvil, who by this deduction was re|duced
to &s;omewhat le&s;s than thirty.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he chearfully beggared him&s;elf in
behalf of his friend, for who&s;e relea&s;e he forth|with
obtained an order: and next day our adven|turer
having bid a formal adieu to his fellows in
di&s;tre&s;s, and in particular to his maje&s;ty, for
who&s;e re&s;toration his prayers were preferred, he
quitted the jail, and accompanied his deliverer,
with all the outward marks of unutterable grati|tude
and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Surely, if his heart had been made of <HI>penetra|ble
&s;tuff,</HI> it would have been touched by the cir|cum&s;tances
of this redemption: but, had not his
&s;oul been invincible to all &s;uch attacks, the&s;e me|moirs
would, po&s;&s;ibly, never have &s;een the light.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Renaldo's lodgings, that
young gentleman honoured him with other proofs
of confidence and friend&s;hip, by giving him a cir|cum&s;tantial
detail of all the adventures in which
he had been engaged after Fathom's de&s;ertion
from the imperial camp. He told him, that
immediately after the war was fini&s;hed, his father
had pre&s;&s;ed him to a very advantageous match,
with which he would have complied, though his
heart was not at all concerned, had not he been
inflamed with the de&s;ire of &s;eeing the world be|fore
he could take any &s;tep towards a &s;ettlement
for life: that he had &s;ignfied his &s;entiments on
this head to the Count, who oppo&s;ed them with
<PB N="53" REF="54">
unu&s;ual ob&s;tinacy, as productive of a delay which
might be fatal to his propo&s;al: for which rea&s;on
he had retired <HI>inc$g$ito</HI> from his family, and tra|velled
thro' &s;undry &s;tates and countries in a di&s;|gui&s;e
by which he eluded the inquiries of his pa|rents.</P>
<P>That in the cour&s;e of the&s;e peregrinations he
was captivated by the irre&s;i&s;tible charms of a young
lady on who&s;e heart he had the good fortune to
make a tender impre&s;&s;ion: that their mutual love
had &s;ubjected both to many dangers and difficul|ties,
during which they &s;uffered a cruel &s;epara|tion;
after the torments of which, he had hap|pily
found her in England, where &s;he now lived
entirely cut off from her native country and con|nexions,
and de&s;titute of every other re&s;ource but
his honour, love, and protection: and, finally,
that he was determined to combat his own de|&s;ires,
how violent &s;oever they might be, until he
&s;hould have made &s;ome &s;uitable provi&s;ion for the
con&s;equences of a &s;tricter union with the mi&s;tre&s;s
of his &s;oul, that he might not by a precipitate
marriage ruin the per&s;on whom he adored.</P>
<P>This end he propo&s;ed to attain, by an applica+tion
to the court of Vienna, which, he did not
doubt, would have &s;ome regard to his own &s;er|vice
and that of his father; and thither he re|&s;olved
to repair with the fir&s;t opportunity, now
that he had found a friend with whom he could
intru&s;t the ine&s;timable jewel of his heart.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e gave our hero to under&s;tand, that
he had been eight months in England, during
which he had lived in a frugal manner, that he
might not unnece&s;&s;arily exhau&s;t the money he had
been able to rai&s;e upon his own credit; that hi|therto
he had been obliged to defer his departure
<PB N="54" REF="55">
for Germany, on account of his attendance upon
the mother of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who was lately dead
of &s;orrow and chagrin; and that &s;ince he re&s;ided
in London, he had often heard of the celebrated
Count Fathom, tho' he never imagined that his
friend Ferdinand could be di&s;tingui&s;hed by that
appellation.</P>

<HEAD>Fathom ju&s;tifies the proverb, &startq;What's bred in the
bone will never come out of the fle&s;h.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>SOme circum&s;tances of this conver&s;ation made
a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of our adven|turer,
who neverthele&s;s concealed his emotions
from the knowledge of his friend, and was next
day introduced to that hidden trea&s;ure of which
Renaldo had &s;poke with &s;uch rapture and adora|tion.
It was not without rea&s;on he had expa|tiated
upon the per&s;onal attractions of this young
lady, whom (for the pre&s;ent) we &s;hall call Moni|mia,
a name that implies her orphan &s;ituation.
When &s;he entered the room, even Fathom,
who&s;e eyes had been &s;ated with beauty, was
&s;truck dumb with admiration, and could &s;carce
recollect him&s;elf &s;o far as to perform the cere|mony
of his introduction.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to be about the age of eighteen:
her &s;tature was tail; her motion graceful; a
knot of artificial flowers re&s;trained the luxu|riancy
of her fine black hair that flowed in &s;hin|ing
ringlets a-down her &s;nowy neck. The con|tour
of her face was oval; her forehead remark|ably
high; her complexion clean and delicate,
tho' not florid; and her eyes were &s;o piercing as
<PB N="55" REF="56">
to &s;trike the &s;oul of every beholder: yet, upon
this occa&s;ion, one half of their vivacity was eclip|&s;ed
by a langui&s;hing air of melancholy concern;
which, while it in a manner &s;heathed the edge
of her beauty, added a mo&s;t engaging &s;weetne&s;s
to her looks: in &s;hort, every feature was elegant|ly
perfect; and the harmony of the whole ravi&s;h|ing
and delightful.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive the mutual &s;entiments
of the two lovers, at meeting, by the plea&s;ure
that &s;en&s;ibly diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in the countenances
of both. Fathom was received by her as the in|timate
friend of her admirer, whom &s;he had often
heard of in terms of the mo&s;t &s;incere affection;
and the conver&s;ation was carried on in the Italian
language, becau&s;e &s;he was a foreigner who had
not as yet made great proficiency in the know|ledge
of the Engli&s;h tongue. Her under&s;tanding
was &s;uch, as, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, reinforced
the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which was in&s;pired by her ap|pearance;
and if the &s;um total of her charms
could not melt the heart, it at lea&s;t excited the
appetite of Fathom to &s;uch a degree, that he
gazed upon her with &s;uch violence of de&s;ire, as
had never tran&s;ported him before; and in&s;tant|ly
began to harbour thoughts not only de&s;tructive
to the peace of his generous patron, but al&s;o to
the prudential maxims he had adopted on his fir&s;t
entrance into life.</P>
<P>We have already recorded divers in&s;tances of
his conduct, to prove that there was an intempe|rance
in his blood, which often interfered with
his caution: and although he had found means to
render this heat &s;ometimes &s;ub&s;ervient to his in|tere&s;t;
yet, in all probability, Heaven mingled
the ingredient in his con&s;titution, on purpo&s;e to
<PB N="56" REF="57">
counteract his con&s;ummate craft, defeat the vil|lany
of his intention, and, at la&s;t, expo&s;e him to
the ju&s;tice of the law, and the contempt of his
fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Stimulated as he was by the beauty of the in|comparable
Monimia, he fore&s;aw that the con|que&s;t
of her heart would co&s;t him a thou&s;and
times more labour and addre&s;s than all the victo|ries
he had ever atchieved: for, be&s;ides her &s;upe|rior
under&s;tanding, her &s;entiments of honour,
virtue, gratitude, religion, and pride of birth,
her heart was already engaged by the tendere&s;t
ties of love and obligation, to a man who&s;e per|&s;on
and acquired accompli&s;hments at lea&s;t equalled
his own; and who&s;e connexion with him was of
&s;uch a nature, as rai&s;ed an almo&s;t in&s;urmountable
bar to his de&s;ign: becau&s;e, with what face could
he commence rival to the per&s;on who&s;e family
had rai&s;ed him from want and &s;ervility, and who&s;e
own genero&s;ity had re&s;cued him from the mi&s;eries
of a dreary jail?</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e reflections, he would not
lay a&s;ide an idea which &s;o agreeably flattered his
imagination. He, like every other projector in
the &s;ame circum&s;tances, was &s;o partial to his own
qualifications, as to think the lady would &s;oon per|ceive
a difference between him and Renaldo that
could not fail to turn to his advantage in her opi|nion.
He depended a good deal on the levity and
incon&s;tancy of the &s;ex; and did not doubt, that,
in the cour&s;e of their acquaintance, he &s;hould
profit by that languor which often creeps upon
and flattens the intercour&s;e of lovers cloyed with
the $ight and conver&s;ation of each other.</P>
<P>This way of arguing was very natural to a
man who had never known other motives than
<PB N="57" REF="58">
tho&s;e of &s;en&s;uality and convenience; and perhaps,
upon the&s;e maxims, he might have &s;ucceeded with
nine tenths of the fair &s;ex: but, for once, he
erred in his calculation. Monimia's &s;oul was
perfect: her virtue impregnable. His fir&s;t ap|proaches
were, as u&s;ual, performed by the me|thod
of in&s;inuation, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that
in a few days, he actually acquired a very di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
&s;hare of her favour and e&s;teem: to this
he had been recommended in the warme&s;t &s;train
of exaggerating friend&s;hip, by her dear Renaldo;
&s;o that placing the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence
in his honour and integrity, and being almo&s;t
quite de&s;titute of acquaintance, &s;he made no
&s;eruple of owning her&s;elf plea&s;ed with his com|pany
and conver&s;ation; and therefore he was
never abridg'd in point of opportunity. She had
too much di&s;cernment to overlook his uncommon
talents and agreeable addre&s;s, and too much &s;u&s;|ceptibility
to ob&s;erve them with indifference. She
not only regarded him as the confident of her
lover, but admired him as a per&s;on who&s;e attach|ment
did honour to Count Melvil's choice: &s;he
found his di&s;cour&s;e remarkably entertaining, his
politene&s;s dignified with an air of uncommon &s;in|cerity;
and &s;he was ravi&s;hed with his &s;kill in mu|&s;ick,
an art of which &s;he was deeply enamoured.</P>
<P>While he thus ingratiated him&s;elf with the fair
Monimia, Renaldo rejoiced at their intimacy,
being extremely happy in the thought of having
found a friend who could amu&s;e and protect the
dear creature in his ab&s;ence. That &s;he might be the
better prepared for the temporary &s;eparation which
he meditated, he began to be le&s;s frequent in his
vi&s;its, or rather to interrupt by gradual intermi&s;|&s;ions
the con&s;tant attendance he had be&s;towed upon
<PB N="58" REF="59">
her &s;ince her mother's death. This alteration &s;he
was enabled to bear by the a&s;&s;iduities of Fathom,
when &s;he under&s;tood that her lover was indi&s;pen|&s;ibly
employed in negotiating a &s;um of money for
the purpo&s;es of his intended voyage. This was
really the ca&s;e: for, as the reader hath been al|ready
informed, the provi&s;ion he had made for
that emergency was expeded in behalf of our ad|venturer;
and the per&s;ons of whom he had bor|rowed
it, far from approving of the u&s;e to which
it was put, and accommodating him with a fre&s;h
&s;upply, reproached him with his benevolence as
an act of di&s;hone&s;ty to them, and, in&s;tead of fa|vouring
this &s;econd application, threatened to di&s;|tre&s;s
him for what he had already received.
While he endeavoured to &s;urmount the&s;e diffi|culties,
his &s;mall rever&s;ion was quite exhau&s;ted,
and he &s;aw him&s;elf on the brink of wanting the
common nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>There was no difficulty which he could not
have encountered with fortitude, had he alone
been concerned: but his affection and regard for
Monimia were of &s;uch a delicate nature, that, far
from being able to bear the pro&s;pect of her want|ing
the lea&s;t convenience, he could not endure
that &s;he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect her &s;ituation co&s;t him
a moment's perplexity; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw it
would wring her gentle heart with un&s;peakable
angui&s;h and vexation. This therefore he endea|voured
to anticipate by expre&s;&s;ions of confidence
in the emperor's equity, and frequent declara|tions
touching the goodne&s;s and &s;ecurity of that
credit from which he derived his pre&s;ent &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>

<P>HIS affairs being thus circum&s;tanced, it is
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he pa&s;&s;ed his time
in tranquillity. Every day u&s;hered in new de|mands
and fre&s;h anxiety: for, though his oeco|nomy
was frugal, it could not be &s;upported with|out
money; and now not only his funds were
drained, but al&s;o his private friends tired of re|lieving
his dome&s;tic nece&s;&s;ities: nay, they began
to relinqui&s;h his company, which formerly they
had coveted; and tho&s;e who &s;till favoured him
with their company, embittered that favour with
di&s;agreeable advice mingled with impertinent re|proof.
They loudly exclaimed again&s;t the la&s;t
in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip for Fathom as a piece
of wrong-headed extravagance, which neither his
fortune could afford, nor his con&s;cience excu&s;e;
and alledged, that &s;uch &s;pecimens of genero&s;ity
are vicious in any man, let his finances be never
&s;o opulent, if he has any relations of his own
who need his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but altogether &s;candalous,
not to &s;ay unju&s;t, in a per&s;on who depends for
his own &s;upport upon the favour of his friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e expo&s;tulations did not even re&s;pect the
beauteous, the accompli&s;hed, the gentle-hearted,
the orphan Monimia. Although they owned her
perfections, and did not deny that it would be
highly meritorious in any man of fortune to make
her happy, they di&s;approved of Renaldo's attach|ment
to the fair beggar, made light of that inti|mate
union of hearts which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the
<PB N="60" REF="61">
two lovers, and which no human con&s;ideration
could di&s;&s;olve; and &s;ome among them, in the
con&s;ummation of their prudence, ventured to hint
a propo&s;al of providing for her in the &s;ervice of
&s;ome lady of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Any reader of &s;en&s;ibility will ea&s;ily conceive
how the&s;e admonitions were reli&s;hed by a young
gentleman who&s;e pride was indomitable, who&s;e
notions of honour were &s;crupulou&s;ly rigid and ro|mantic,
who&s;e temper was warm, and who&s;e
love was inten&s;e. Every &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tion was as
a dagger to his &s;oul; and what rendered the ror|ture
more exqui&s;ite, he lay under obligations to
tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;elfi&s;h and fordid &s;enti|ments
he di&s;dained: &s;o that he was re&s;tricted by
gratitude from giving vent to his indignation; and
his forlorn circum&s;tances would not permit him
to renounce their acquaintance. While he &s;trug|gled
with the&s;e mortifications, his wants grew
more and importunate, and his creditors became
clamorous.</P>
<P>Fathom, to whom all his grievances were di&s;|clo&s;ed,
lamented his hard hap with all the demon|&s;trations
of &s;ympathy which he could expect to
find in &s;uch a zealous adherent; he upbraided him|&s;elf
ince&s;&s;antly as the cau&s;e of his patron's di&s;tre&s;s;
took God to witne&s;s, that he would rather have
peri&s;hed in jail, than have enjoyed his liberty, had
he known it would have co&s;t his deare&s;t friend
and benefactor one tenth part of the angui&s;h he
now &s;aw him &s;uffer; and in conclu&s;ion, the fer|vency
of his affection glowed to &s;uch a degree,
that he offered to beg, &s;teal, or plunder on the
high way, for Renaldo's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Certain it is, he might have recollected a le&s;s
di&s;agreeable expedient than any of the&s;e, to alle|viate
<PB N="61" REF="62">
the pangs of this unhappy lover: for, at that
very period, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of money and move|ables
to the amount of a much greater &s;um than that
which was nece&s;&s;ary to remove the &s;evere&s;t pangs
of the Count's misfortune. But, whether he did
not reflect upon this re&s;ource, or was willing to
let Melvil be better acquainted with adver&s;ity,
which is the great &s;chool of life, I &s;hall leave
the reader to determine: yet, &s;o far was he from
&s;upplying the wants of the young Hungarian,
that he did not &s;cruple to receive a &s;hare of the
mi&s;erable pittance which that gentleman made
&s;hift to extort from the complai&s;ance of a few
companions, who&s;e countenance he &s;till enjoyed.</P>
<P>Renaldo's life was now become a &s;acrifice to
the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s: almo&s;t his whole time
was engro&s;&s;ed by a double &s;cheme comprehending
his efforts to render his departure practicable, and
his expedients for rai&s;ing the means of daily bread.
With regard to the fir&s;t, he exerted him&s;elf among
a &s;et of merchants, &s;ome of whom knew his fa|mily
and expectations; and, for the la&s;t, he was
fain to depend upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few inti|mates,
who were not in condition to furni&s;h him
with &s;ums of con&s;equence. The&s;e, however,
gradually dropped off, on pretence of friendly re|&s;entment
for his indi&s;creet conduct; &s;o that he
found him&s;elf naked and de&s;erted by all his former
companions, except one gentleman, with whom
he had lived in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved corre&s;pondence,
as with a per&s;on of the warme&s;t friend&s;hip, and
the mo&s;t unbounded benevolence: nay, he had
actually experienced repeated proofs of his gene|ro&s;ity;
and &s;uch were the Count's &s;entiments of
the gratitude, love and e&s;teem which were due
to the author of the&s;e obligations, that he would
<PB N="62" REF="63">
have willingly laid down his own life for his in|tere&s;t
or advantage. He had already been at dif|ferent
times accommodated by this benefactor,
with occa&s;ional &s;upplies, amounting in the whole
to about forty or fifty pounds; and &s;o fearful was
he of taking any &s;tep by which he might forfeit
the good-will of this gentleman, that he &s;truggled
with unparalelled difficulty and vexation, before
he could prevail upon him&s;elf to put his liberality
to another proof.</P>
<P>What maxims of delicacy will not the dire
calls of nece&s;&s;ity infringe! Reduced to the al|ternative
of applying once more to that benefi|cence
which had never failed him, or of &s;eeing
Monimia &s;tarve, he cho&s;e the fir&s;t, as of two evils
the lea&s;t, and intru&s;ted Fathom with a letter ex|plaining
the bitterne&s;s of his ca&s;e. It was not
without trepidation that he received in the even|ing,
from his me&s;&s;enger, an an&s;wer to this billet:
but what were his pangs when he learned the
contents? The gentleman, after having profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf Melvil's &s;incere well-wi&s;her, gave him to
under&s;tand, that he was re&s;olved for the future to
detach him&s;elf from every corre&s;pondence which
would be inconvenient for him to maintain; that
he con&s;idered his intimacy with the Count in that
light: yet, neverthele&s;s, if his di&s;tre&s;s was really
as great as he had-de&s;cribed it, he would &s;till con|tribute
&s;omething towards his relief; and accord|ingly
had &s;ent by the bearer five guineas for that
purpo&s;e: but de&s;ired him to take notice, that, in
&s;o doing, he laid him&s;elf under &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>Renaldo's grief and mortification at this di&s;ap|pointment
were un&s;peakable: he now &s;aw demo|li&s;hed
the la&s;t &s;creen betwixt him and the extre|mity
of indigence and woe; he beheld the mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="63" REF="64">
of his &s;oul abandoned to the bleake&s;t &s;cenes of
poverty and want; and he deeply re&s;ented the
lofty &s;train of the letter, by which he conceived
him&s;elf treated as a worthle&s;s &s;pendthrift, and im|portunate
beggar. Tho' his pur&s;e was exhau&s;ted
to the la&s;t &s;hilling; tho' he was &s;urrounded with
nece&s;&s;ities and demands, and knew not how to
provide another meal for his fair dependant, he,
in oppo&s;ition to all the &s;ugge&s;tions and eloquence
of Fathom, di&s;patched him with the money and
another billet, intimating in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful
terms, that he approved of his friend's new
adopted maxim, which, for the future, he &s;hould
always take care to remember; and that he had
&s;ent back the la&s;t in&s;tance of his bounty, as a proof
how little he was di&s;po&s;ed to incommode his be|nefactor.</P>
<P>This letter, tho' &s;incerely meant, and written
in a very &s;erious mood, the gentleman con&s;idered
as an ungrateful piece of irony, and in that opi|nion
complained to &s;everal per&s;ons of the Count's
acquaintance, who unanimou&s;ly exclaimed again&s;t
him, as a &s;ordid, unthankful, and profligate knave
that abu&s;ed and reviled tho&s;e very people who had
generou&s;ly befriended him, whenever they found
it inconvenient to nouri&s;h his extravagance with
further &s;upplies. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e accumu|lated
oppre&s;&s;ions, he &s;till per&s;evered with fortitude
in his endeavours to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from this
maze of mi&s;ery. To the&s;e he was encouraged
by a letter which about this time he received from
his &s;i&s;ter, importing, that &s;he had good rea&s;on to
believe the real will of her father had been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
for certain fini&s;ter views; and de&s;iring
him to ha&s;ten his departure for Hungary, where
he would &s;till find &s;ome friends who were both
<PB N="64" REF="65">
able and willing to &s;upport his cau&s;e. He had
&s;ome trinkets left; the pawn-broker's &s;hop was
&s;till open; and hitherto he made &s;hift to conceal
from Monimia the extent of his affiiction.</P>
<P>The money-broker whom he employed, after
having amu&s;ed him with a variety of &s;chemes,
which &s;erved no other purpo&s;e than that of pro|tracting
his own job, at length undertook to make
him acquainted with a &s;et of monied men who
had been very adventurous in lending &s;ums
upon per&s;onal &s;ecurity; he was therefore in|troduced
to their club, in the mo&s;t favourable
manner, after the broker had endeavoured to pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s
them &s;eparately, with magnificent ideas of
his family and fortune. By means of this antici|pation,
he was received with a manife&s;t relaxation
of that &s;everity, which people of this cla&s;s mingle
in their a&s;pects to the world in general; and they
even vied with each other in their demon&s;trations
of ho&s;pitality and re&s;pect; for every one in parti|cular
looked upon him as a young heir, who would
bleed freely, and mortgage at cent, per cent.</P>
<P>Renaldo, buoyed up with the&s;e exterior civi|lities,
began to flatter him&s;elf with hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
which, however, were &s;oon checked by the
nature of the conver&s;ation; during which the
chair-man upbraided one of the members in open
club, for having once lent forty pounds upon
&s;light &s;ecurity: the per&s;on accu&s;ed alledged in his
own defence, that the borrower was his own
kin&s;man, who&s;e funds he knew to be &s;ufficient;
that he had granted his bond, and been at the
expence of in&s;uring his life for the money; and,
in conclu&s;ion, had di&s;charged it to the day with
great punctuality. The&s;e allegations were not
deemed exculpatory by the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly,
<PB N="65" REF="66">
who with one voice pronounced him guilty of un|warrantable
ra&s;hne&s;s and indi&s;cretion, which, in
time coming, mu&s;t undoubtedly operate to the
prejudice of his character and credit.</P>
<P>This was a bitter declaration to the young
Count, who, neverthele&s;s, endeavoured to im|prove
the footing he had gained among them,
by courting their company, conforming to their
manners, and attentively li&s;tening to their di&s;|cour&s;e.
When he had cultivated them with
great a&s;&s;iduity, for the &s;pace of &s;ome weeks, dined
at their hou&s;es upon pre&s;&s;ing invitations, and re|ceived
repeated offers of &s;ervice and friend&s;hip,
believing that things were now ripe for the pur|po&s;e,
he one day, at a tavern to which he had
invited him to dinner, ventured to di&s;clo&s;e his
&s;ituation to him, who&s;e countenance was the lea&s;t
unpromi&s;ing; and as he introduced the bu&s;ine&s;s
with a propo&s;al of borrowing money, he per|ceived
his eyes &s;parkle with a vi&s;ible alacrity,
from which he drew an happy pre&s;age. But, alas!
this was no more than a tran&s;ient gleam of &s;un|&s;hine,
which was &s;uddenly obumbrated by the &s;e|quel
of his explanation; in&s;omuch, that, when
the merchant under&s;tood the nature of the &s;ecu|rity,
his vi&s;age was involved in a mo&s;t di&s;agree|able
gloom, and his eyes di&s;torted into a mo&s;t hi|deous
obliquity of vi&s;ion: indeed, he &s;quinted &s;o
horribly, that Renaldo was amazed and almo&s;t
affrighted at his looks, until he perceived that
this di&s;tortion proceeded from concern for a &s;ilver
tobacco-box which he had laid down by him on
the table, after having filled his pipe: as the youth
proceeded to unfold his nece&s;&s;ities, the other be|came
gradually alarmed for this uten&s;il, to which
he darted his eyes a&s;kance in this praeternatural
<PB N="66" REF="67">
direction, until he had &s;lily &s;ecured it in his
pocket.</P>
<P>Having made this &s;ucce&s;sful conveyance, he
&s;hifted his eyes alternately from the young gen|tleman
to the broker, for a con&s;iderable pau&s;e,
during which he in &s;ilence reproached the la&s;t for
introducing &s;uch a beggarly varlet to his acquaint|ance;
then taking the pipe from his mouth,
&startq;Sir, (&s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Count)
if I had all the inclination in the world to com|ply
with your propo&s;al, it is really not in my
power: my corre&s;pondents abroad have remitted
&s;uch a number of bad bills of late, that all my
running ca&s;h hath been exhau&s;ted in &s;upporting
their credit. Mr. Ferret, &s;ure I am, you was not
ignorant of my &s;ituation; and I'm not a little &s;ur|prized,
that you &s;hould bring the gentleman to
me, on bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind: but, as the Wi&s;e
Man ob&s;erves, <HI>Bray a fool in a mortar, and he'll
never be wi&s;e.</HI>&endq; So &s;aying, with a mo&s;t emphatic
glance directed to the broker, he rung the bell,
and called for the reckoning; when, finding that
he was to be the gue&s;t of Renaldo, he thanked
him drily for his good chear, and in an abrupt
manner took him&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Tho' baffled in this quarter, the young gen|tleman
would not de&s;pair; but forthwith em|ployed
Mr. Ferret in an application to another
of the &s;ociety; who, after having heard the terms
of his commi&s;&s;ion, de&s;ired him to tell his princi|pal,
that he could do nothing, without the con|currence
of his partner, who happened to be at
that time in one of our American plantations: a
third being &s;ollicited, excu&s;ed him&s;elf on account
of an oath which he had lately taken, on the back
of a con&s;iderable lo&s;s: a fourth being tried, made
<PB N="67" REF="68">
an&s;wer, that it was not in his way: and a fifth
candidly owned, that he never lent money with|out
proper &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;orlorn Renaldo tried every experi|ment
without &s;ucce&s;s, and now &s;aw the la&s;t ray
of hope extingui&s;hed. Well nigh de&s;titute of
pre&s;ent &s;upport, and encompa&s;&s;ed with unrelent|ing
duns, he was obliged to keep within doors,
and &s;eek &s;ome comfort in the conver&s;ation of his
charming mi&s;tre&s;s, and his faithful friend: yet,
even there, he experienced the extreme&s;t rigour
of adver&s;e fate. Every rap at the door alarmed
him with the expectation of &s;ome noi&s;y trade&s;man
demanding payment, when he endeavoured to a|mu&s;e
him&s;elf with drawing, &s;ome unlucky feature
of the occa&s;ional portrait, recalled the image of
an obdurate creditor, and made him tremble at
the work of his own hands. When he fled for
&s;helter to the flattering creation of fancy, &s;ome
abhorred idea always &s;tarted up amid&s;t the gay
vi&s;ion, and di&s;&s;olved the plea&s;ing enchantment.
Even the &s;eraphic voice of Monimia had no longer
power to compo&s;e the anxious tumults of his mind:
every &s;ong &s;he warbled, every tune &s;he played,
recalled to his remembrance &s;ome &s;cene of love
and happine&s;s elap&s;ed; and overwhelmed his &s;oul
with the woful compari&s;on of pa&s;t and pre&s;ent
fate. He &s;aw all that was amiable and perfect in
woman, all that he held mo&s;t dear and &s;acred
upon earth, tottering on the brink of mi&s;ery,
without knowing the danger of her &s;ituation, and
found him&s;elf unable to prevent her fall, or even
to forewarn her of the peril: for, as we have al|ready
ob&s;erved, his &s;oul could not brook the
thought of communicating the tidings of di&s;tre&s;s
to the tender-hearted Monimia.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Renaldo's di&s;tre&s;s deepens, and Fathom's plot thickens.</HEAD>
<P>SUch aggravated misfortune could not fail to
affect his temper and deportment: the con|tinual
efforts he made to conceal his vexation
produced a manife&s;t di&s;traction in his behaviour
and di&s;cour&s;e. He began to be &s;eized with hor|ror
at the &s;ight of poor Monimia, whom he there|fore
&s;hunned as much as the circum&s;tances of their
corre&s;pondence would allow; and every evening
he went forth alone to &s;ome &s;olitary place, where
he could unperceived give a loo&s;e to the tran&s;ports
of his &s;orrow, and in &s;ilence meditate &s;ome means
to lighten the burden of his woe. His heart was
&s;ometimes &s;o &s;avaged with de&s;pair, which repre|&s;ented
mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he
entertained thoughts of denouncing war again&s;t
the whole community, and &s;upplying his own
wants with the &s;poils he &s;hould win: at other
times, he was tempted with the de&s;ire of putting
an end to his mi&s;eries and life together: yet the&s;e
were but the tran&s;itory &s;ugge&s;tions of temporary
madne&s;s, that &s;oon yielded to the dictates of rea|&s;on.
From the execution of the fir&s;t, he was
re&s;trained by his own notions of honour and mo|rality;
and from u&s;ing the other expedient, he was
deterred by his love for Monimia, together with
the motives of philo&s;ophy and religion.</P>
<P>While in this manner he &s;ecretly nur&s;ed the
worm of grief that preyed upon his vitals, the
alteration in his countenance and conduct did not
e&s;cape the eye of that di&s;cerning young lady. She
was alarmed at the change, yet afraid to inquire
<PB N="69" REF="70">
into the &s;ource of it; for, being ignorant of his
di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he could impute it to no cau&s;e in which
her happine&s;s was not deeply intere&s;ted. She had
ob&s;erved his &s;trained complai&s;ance, and extraor|dinary
emotion: &s;he had detected him in repeated
attempts to avoid her company, and taken notice
of his regular excur&s;ions in the dark. The&s;e were
alarming &s;ymptoms to a lover of her delicacy and
pride: &s;he &s;trove in vain to put the mo&s;t favour|able
con&s;truction on what &s;he &s;aw; and finally,
imputed the effects of his de&s;pondence to the alie|nation
of his heart. Made mi&s;erable beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion
by the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, &s;he imparted them
to Fathom, who by this time was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her confidence and e&s;teem, and implored his
advice touching her conduct in &s;uch a nice con|juncture.</P>
<P>This artful politician, who rejoiced at the ef|fect
of her penetration, no &s;ooner heard him&s;elf
que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject, than he gave tokens of
&s;urprize and confu&s;ion, &s;ignifying his concern to
find &s;he had di&s;covered what (for the honour of his
friend) he wi&s;hed had never come to light. His
behaviour on this occa&s;ion confirmed her fatal
conjecture; and &s;he conjured him in the mo&s;t pa|thetic
manner, to tell her if he thought Renaldo's
heart had contracted any new engagement. At
this que&s;tion, he &s;tarted with &s;igns of extreme a|gitation,
and &s;tifling an artificial &s;igh, &startq;Sure,
madam, &s;aid he, you cannot doubt the Count's
con&s;tancy&mdash;I am confident&mdash;he is certainly&mdash;
I prote&s;t, madam, I am &s;o &s;hocked&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Here he made a full pau&s;e, as if the conflict
between his integrity and his friend&s;hip would not
allow him to proceed, and &s;ummoned the moi&s;ture
into either eye&mdash;&startq;Then are my doubts
<PB N="70" REF="71">
removed, cried the afflicted Monimia: I &s;ee your
candour in the mid&s;t of your attachment to Re|naldo;
and will no longer torment you with im|pertinent
interrogations and vain complaints.&endq;
With the&s;e words, a flood of tears gu&s;hed from
her enchanting eyes, and &s;he in&s;tantly withdrew
into her own apartment, where &s;he indulged her
&s;orrow to exce&s;s. Nor was her grief unanimated
with re&s;entment. She was by birth, nature and
education in&s;pired with that dignity of pride which
ennobles the human heart; and this, by the cir|cum&s;tance
of her pre&s;ent dependence, was ren|dered
extremely jealous and &s;u&s;ceptible: in&s;omuch
that &s;he could not brook the lea&s;t &s;hadow of in|difference,
much le&s;s an injury of &s;uch a nature,
from the man whom &s;he had honoured with her
affections, and for whom &s;he had di&s;obliged and
de&s;erted her family and friends.</P>
<P>Though her love was &s;o unalterably fixed on
this unhappy youth, that, without the continua|tion
of reciprocal regard, her life would have be|come
an un&s;upportable burden, even amid&s;t all
the &s;plendour of affluence and pomp; and altho'
&s;he fore&s;aw, that when his protection &s;hould cea&s;e,
&s;he mu&s;t be left a wretched orphan in a foreign
land, expo&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of want: yet,
&s;uch was the loftine&s;s of her di&s;plea&s;ure, that &s;he
di&s;dained to complain, or even demand an ex|planation
from the &s;uppo&s;ed author of her wrongs.</P>
<P>While &s;he continued undetermined in her pur|po&s;e,
and fluctuating on this &s;ea of torture, Fa|thom,
believing that now was the &s;ea&s;on for
working upon her pa&s;&s;ions, while they were all in
commotion, became, if po&s;&s;ible, more a&s;&s;iduous
than ever about the fair mourner, modelled his
features into a melancholy ca&s;t, pretended to &s;hare
<PB N="71" REF="72">
her di&s;tre&s;s with the mo&s;t emphatic &s;ympathy,
and endeavoured to keep her re&s;entment glowing
by cunning in&s;inuations, which, tho' apparently
de&s;igned to apologize for his friend, &s;erved only
to aggravate the guilt of his perfidy and di&s;honour.
This pretext of friendly concern, is the mo&s;t ef|fectual
vehicle for the conveyance of malice and
&s;lander; and a man's reputation is never &s;o mor|tally
&s;tabbed, as when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in begins with
the preamble of, &startq;For my own part, I can
&s;afely &s;ay, that no man upon earth has a greater
regard for him than I have; and it is with the
utmo&s;t angui&s;h and concern that I &s;ee him mi&s;|behave
in &s;uch a manner.&endq; Then he proceeds
to mangle his character, and the good-natured
hearers concluding he is even blacker than he
is repre&s;ented, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the mo&s;t
attrocious circum&s;tances are &s;oftened or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
by the tenderne&s;s or friend&s;hip of the accu&s;er, ex|claim,
&startq;Good lack! what a wretch he mu&s;t be,
when his be&s;t friends will no longer attempt to
defend him!&endq; Nay, &s;ometimes the&s;e well-wi&s;hers
undertake his defence, and treacherou&s;ly betray
the cau&s;e they have e&s;pou&s;ed, by omitting the
rea&s;ons that may be urged in his vindication.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e methods were practi&s;ed by the wily
Ferdinand, according to the predominant pa&s;&s;ion
of Monimia: when her indignation prevailed, he
expatiated upon his love and &s;incere regard for
Renaldo, which, he &s;aid, had grown up from the
cradle, to &s;uch a degree of fervour, that he would
willingly part with life for his advantage. He
&s;hed tears for his apo&s;tacy; but every drop made
an indelible &s;tain upon his character; and, in the
bitterne&s;s of his grief, &s;wore, notwith&s;tanding his
fondne&s;s for Renaldo, which had become a part
<PB REF="73">
of his con&s;titution, that the young Hungarian de|&s;erved
the mo&s;t infamous de&s;tiny, for having in|jured
&s;uch perfection. At other times, when he
found her melted into &s;ilent &s;orrow, he affected to
excu&s;e the conduct of his friend. He informed
her, that the young gentleman's temper had been
uneven from his infancy; that frailty was natural
to man; that he might in time be reclaimed by
&s;elf-conviction; he even hinted, that &s;he might
have probably a&s;cribed to incon&s;tancy, what was
really the effect of &s;ome chagrin which he indu|&s;triou&s;ly
concealed from his participation: but,
when he found her di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to this la&s;t
&s;ugge&s;tion, he de&s;troyed the force of it, by recol|lecting
the circum&s;tances of his nocturnal rambles,
which, he owned, would admit of no favourable
con&s;truction.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means he blew the coals of her
jealou&s;y, and inhanced the value of his own cha|racter,
at the &s;ame time; for &s;he looked upon
him as a mirror of faith and integrity, and the
mind being overcharged with woe, naturally &s;eeks
&s;ome confident, upon who&s;e &s;ympathy it can re|po&s;e$
it&s;elf: indeed, his great aim was, to make
him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to her affliction, and &s;ettle a
go&s;&s;iping corre&s;pondence, in the familiarity of
which he hoped his purpo&s;e would certainly be
an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Yet the exertion of the&s;e talents was not li|mited
to her alone. While he laid the&s;e trains
for the haple&s;s young lady, he was preparing
&s;nares of another kind for her un&s;u&s;pecting lover,
who (for the completion of his mi&s;ery) about this
time began to perceive marks of di&s;quiet and di&s;|plea&s;ure
in the countenance and deportment of
his adored Monimia: for, that young lady, in the
<PB N="73" REF="74">
mid&s;t of her grief, remembered her origin, and
over her vexation affected to throw a veil of
tranquillity, which &s;erved only to give an air of
di&s;gu&s;t to her internal di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>Renaldo, who&s;e patience and philo&s;ophy were
barely &s;ufficient to bear the load of his other
evils, would have been quite overwhelmed with
the additional burthen of Monimia's woe, if it
had not a&s;&s;umed this appearance of di&s;e&s;teem,
which, as he knew he had not de&s;erved it,
brought his re&s;entment to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Yet
this was but a wretched cordial to &s;upport him
again&s;t the baleful reflections that a&s;&s;aulted him
from every quarter; it operated like tho&s;e de&s;perate
remedies, which while they &s;timulate exhau&s;ted
nature, help to de&s;troy the very fundamentals of
the con&s;titution. He reviewed his own conduct
with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, and could not recol|lect
one circum&s;tance which could ju&s;tly of|fend
the idol of his &s;oul. The more blamele&s;s
he appeared to him&s;elf in this examination, the
le&s;s excu&s;able did her behaviour appear: He
ta&s;ked his penetration to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this
alteration; he burned with impatience to know
it; his di&s;cernment failed him, and he was a|fraid
(tho' he knew not why) to demand an ex|planation.
His thoughts were &s;o circum&s;tanced,
that he dur&s;t not even unbo&s;om him&s;elf to Fa|thom,
tho' his own virtue and friend&s;hip re&s;i&s;ted
tho&s;e &s;entiments that began to intrude upon his
mind, with &s;ugge&s;tions to the prejudice of our
adventurer's fidelity.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, unable to endure the torments
of &s;uch intere&s;ting &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he, at length, made
an effort to expo&s;tulate with the fair orphan; and
in an abrupt addre&s;s, the effect of his fear and
<PB N="74" REF="75">
confu&s;ion, begged to know if he had inadvert|ently
done any thing to incur her di&s;plea&s;ure.
Monimia hearing her&s;elf bluntly acco&s;ted in this
unu&s;ual &s;train, after repeated in&s;tances of his re|&s;erve
and &s;uppo&s;ed incon&s;tancy, con&s;idered the
que&s;tion as a fre&s;h in&s;ult, and &s;ummoning her
whole pride to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, replied with af|fected
tranquillity, or rather with an air of &s;corn,
that &s;he had no title to judge, neither did &s;he
pretend to condemn his conduct. This an&s;wer,
&s;o wide of that tenderne&s;s and concern which
had hitherto manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the di&s;po&s;ition
of his amiable mi&s;tre&s;s, deprived him of all power
to carry on the conver&s;ation, and he retired
with a low bow, fully convinced of his having
irretrievably lo&s;t the place he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
her affection; for, to his imagination, warped
and blinded by his misfortunes, her demeanour
&s;eemed fraught, not with a tran&s;ient gleam of
anger, which a re&s;pectful lover would &s;oon have
appea&s;ed, but with that contempt and indiffer|ence
which denote a total ab&s;ence of affection
and e&s;teem. She, on the other hand, mi&s;con|&s;trued
his &s;udden retreat; and now they beheld
the actions of each other thro' the fal&s;e medium
of prejudice and re&s;entment. To &s;uch fatal mi&s;|under&s;tandings,
the peace and happine&s;s of whole
families often fall a &s;acrifice.</P>

<P>INfluenced by this dire mi&s;take, the brea&s;ts of

every circum&s;tance of her mi&s;ery in the mo&s;t
aggravating colours, that they might make the
deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, and the more
&s;peedily contribute to that di&s;&s;olution for which
&s;he ardently wi&s;hed, as a total relea&s;e from
woe.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e pinings, &s;he began to loath all
&s;u&s;tenance; her cheeks grew wan, her bright
eyes lo&s;t their &s;plendor, the ro&s;es vani&s;hed from
<PB N="76" REF="77">
her lips, and her delicate limbs could hardly &s;up|port
their burthen; in a word, her &s;ole con&s;ola|tion
was limited to the pro&s;pect of depo&s;iting her
&s;orrows in the grave; and her only wi&s;h was to
procure a retreat in which &s;he might wait with
re&s;ignation for that happy period. Yet this me|lancholy
comfort &s;he could not obtain without
the advice and mediation of Fathom, whom &s;he
therefore &s;till continued to &s;ee and con&s;ult.
While the&s;e con&s;ultations were held, Renaldo's
bo&s;om was ravaged with tempe&s;ts of rage and di|&s;traction.
He believed him&s;elf &s;uper&s;eded in the
affection of his mi&s;tre&s;s, by &s;ome favoured ri|val,
who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s rankled at his &s;oul; and
tho' he &s;carce dur&s;t communicate the &s;u&s;picion
to his own heart, his ob&s;ervation continually
whi&s;pered to him, that he was &s;upplanted by his
friend Fathom; for Monimia was totally detach|ed
from the conver&s;ation of every other man,
and he had of late noted their intercour&s;e with
di&s;tempered eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;ometimes tran&s;ported
him to &s;uch a degree of frenzy, that he was
tempted to &s;acrifice them both as traitors to gra|titude,
friend&s;hip, and love; but &s;uch deliriums
&s;oon vani&s;hed before his honour and humanity.
He would not allow him&s;elf to think ami&s;s of
Ferdinand, until &s;ome undoubted mark of his
guilt &s;hould appear; and this was &s;o far from
being the ca&s;e, that hitherto there was &s;carce a
pre&s;umption. On the contrary (&s;aid he to him|&s;elf)
I am hourly receiving proofs of his &s;ympa|thy
and attachment: Not but that he may be the
innocent cau&s;e of my mi&s;hap. His &s;uperior qua|lifications
may have attracted the eye, and en|gaged
the heart of that incon&s;tant fair, without
<PB N="77" REF="78">
his being &s;en&s;ible of the victory he has won; or,
perhaps, &s;hocked at the conque&s;t he hath unwil|lingly
made, he di&s;courages her advances, tries
to rea&s;on down her unju&s;ti&s;iable pa&s;&s;ion, and in
the mean time, conceals from me the particulars,
out of regard to my happine&s;s and quiet.</P>
<P>Under cover of the&s;e favourable conjectures,
our adventurer &s;ecurely pro&s;ecuted his &s;cheme
upon the unfortunate Monimia. He dedicated
him&s;elf wholly to her &s;ervice and conver&s;ation,
except at tho&s;e times when his company was re|que&s;ted
by Renaldo, who now very &s;eldom ex|acted
his attendance: In his mini&s;try about the
per&s;on of the beauteous orphan, this cunning in|cendiary
mingled &s;uch awful regard, &s;uch melt|ing
compa&s;&s;ion, as effectually &s;creened him from
the &s;u&s;picion of treachery, while he widened the
fatal breach between her and her lover, by the
mo&s;t diabolical in&s;inuations. He repre&s;ented his
friend as a voluptuary, who gratified his own
appetite without the lea&s;t regard to honour or
con&s;cience; and with a &s;hew of infinite reluct|ance
imparted &s;ome anecdotes of his &s;en&s;uality,
which he had feigned for the purpo&s;e; then he
would exclaim in an affected tran&s;port, &startq;Graci|ous
heaven! is it po&s;&s;ible for any man who has
the lea&s;t title to perception or humanity to injure
&s;uch innocence and perfection! for my own part,
had I been &s;o unde&s;ervedly happy&mdash;heaven
and earth! Forgive my tran&s;ports, madam, I can|not
help &s;eeing and admiring &s;uch divine attrac|tions.
I cannot help re&s;enting your wrongs;
it is the cau&s;e of virtue I e&s;pou&s;e; it ought to be
the cau&s;e of every hone&s;t man.&endq;</P>
<P>He had often repeated &s;uch apo&s;trophes as
the&s;e, which &s;he a&s;cribed to nothing el&s;e than
<PB N="78" REF="79">
&s;heer benevolence and virtuous indignation, and
actually began to think he had made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon her heart; not that he now en|tertained
the hope of an immediate triumph
over her cha&s;tity. The more he contemplated
her character, the more difficult the conque&s;t
&s;eemed to be; he therefore altered his plan, and
re&s;olved to carry on his operations, under the
&s;helter of honourable propo&s;als, fore&s;eeing that
a wife of her qualifications, if properly managed,
would turn greatly to the account of the hu&s;|band;
or if her virtue &s;hould prove refractory,
that he could, at any time, rid him&s;elf of the
incumbrance, by decamping without beat of
drum, after he &s;hould be cloyed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Elevated by the&s;e expectations, he, one day,
in the mid&s;t of a preconcerted rhap&s;ody, import|ing,
that he could no longer conceal the fire
that preyed upon his heart, threw him&s;elf on
his knees before the lovely mourner, and im|printed
a ki&s;s on her fair hand: Tho' he did
not pre&s;ume to take this liberty, till after &s;uch
preparation as he thought had altogether extin|gui&s;hed
her regard for Melvil, and paved the way
for his own reception in room of that di&s;carded
lover; he had &s;o far over&s;hot his mark, that
Monimia, in&s;tead of favouring his declaration,
&s;tarted up and retired in &s;ilence, her cheeks
glowing with &s;hame, and her eyes gleaming
with indignation.</P>
<P>Ferdinand no &s;ooner recovered from the con|fu&s;ion
produced by this unexpected repul&s;e, than
he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to a &s;peedy de|termination,
left the offended fair one &s;hould ap|peal
to Renaldo, in which ca&s;e they might be
mutually undeceived, to his utter &s;hame and con|&s;ion;
<PB N="79" REF="80">
he therefore re&s;olved to depreciate her
anger, by humble &s;upplications, and by prote&s;t|ing,
that whatever tortures he might &s;uffer by
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments, &s;he &s;hould never again
be offended with a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having thus appea&s;ed the gentle Monimia,
and di&s;covered, that in &s;pite of her re&s;entment,
his friend &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, he de|termined
to work an effectual &s;eparation, &s;o
as that the young lady being utterly de&s;erted by
Melvil, &s;hould be left altogether in his power.
With this chri&s;tian intention he began to &s;adden
his vi&s;age with a double &s;hade of pen&s;ive me|lancholy,
in the pre&s;ence of Renaldo, to &s;ti&s;le a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of involuntary &s;ighs, to an&s;wer from
the purpo&s;e, to be incoherent in his di&s;cour&s;e,
and in a word, to act the part of a per&s;on
wrapt up in &s;orrowful cogitation.</P>
<P>Count Melvil, &s;oon as he perceived the&s;e
&s;ymptoms, very kindly enquired into the cau&s;e
of them, and was not a little alarmed to hear
the artful and eva&s;ive an&s;wers of Ferdmand, who
without di&s;clo&s;ing the &s;ource of his di&s;quiet,
earne&s;tly begg'd leave to retire into &s;ome other
corner of the world. Roa&s;ed by this intreaty,
the Hungarian's jealou&s;y awoke, and with vio|lent
agitation he exclaimed: &startq;Then are my
fears too true! my dear Fathom, I comprehend
the meaning of your reque&s;t. I have for &s;ome
time perceived an ho&s;t of horrors approaching
from that quarter. I know your worth and ho|nour.
I depend upon your friend&s;hip, and con|jure
you by all the ties of it, to free me at once
from the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;u&s;pen&s;e, by owning
you have involuntarily captivated the heart of
that unhappy maiden.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">
To this &s;olemn interrogation he made no
reply; but &s;hedding a flood of tears (of which
he had always a magazine at command) he re|peated
his de&s;ire of withdrawing, and took God
to witne&s;s, that what he propo&s;ed was &s;olely for
the quiet of his honoured patron and beloved
friend. &startq;Enough (cried the unfortunate Re|naldo)
the mea&s;ure of my woes is now filled up.&endq;
So &s;aying, he fell backwards in a &s;woon, from
which he was with difficulty recovered to the
&s;en&s;ation of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments. Dur|ing
this paroxy&s;m, our adventurer nur&s;ed him
with infinite care and tenderne&s;s; he exhorted
him to &s;ummon all his fortitude to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
to remember his fore-fathers. and exert him&s;elf
in the imitation of their virtues; to fly from tho&s;e
bewitching charms which had en&s;laved his better
part, to retrieve his peace of mind, by reflect|ing
on the incon&s;tancy and ingratitude of woman,
and amu&s;e his imagination in the pur&s;uit of ho|nour
and glory.</P>
<P>After the&s;e admonitions, he abu&s;ed his ears
with a forged detail of the gradual advances made
to him by Monimia, and the &s;teps he had taken
to di&s;courage her addre&s;&s;es, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h her
virtue; poi&s;oning the mind of that credulous
youth to &s;uch a degree, that in all probability he
would have put a fatal period to his own exi&s;t|ence,
had not Fathom found means to allay the
rage of his exta&s;y, by the cunning arrangement
of oppo&s;ite con&s;iderations. He &s;et his pride a|gain&s;t
his love, he oppo&s;ed his re&s;entment to his
&s;orrow, and his ambition to his de&s;pair. Not|with&s;tanding
the ballance of power, &s;o &s;ettled
among the&s;e antagoni&s;ts, &s;o violent were the
&s;hocks of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conflicts, that his bo|&s;om
<PB N="81" REF="82">
fared like a wretched province harra&s;&s;ed,
depopulated, and laid wa&s;te, by two fierce con|tending
armies. From this moment, his life was
nothing but an alternation of &s;tarts and reveries;
he wept and raved by turns, according to the
prevailing gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion; food became a &s;tranger
to his lips, and &s;leep to his eye-lids; he could
not &s;upport the pre&s;ence of Monimia; her ab|&s;ence
increa&s;ed the torture of his pangs; and
when he met her by accident, he &s;tarted back
with horror, like a traveller who chances to
tread upon a &s;nake.</P>
<P>The poor afflicted orphan, worn to a &s;hadow
with &s;elf-con&s;uming angui&s;h, eager to find &s;ome
lowly retreat, where &s;he could breathe out her
&s;oul in peace, and terrified at the frantic behavi|our
of Renaldo, communicated to Fathom her
de&s;ire of removing, and begged that he would
take a &s;mall picture of her father, decorated with
diamonds, and convert them into money for the
expence of her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This was the la&s;t
pledge of her family, which &s;he had received
from her mother, who had pre&s;erved it in the
mid&s;t of numberle&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and no other &s;pe|cies
of mi&s;ery, but that which &s;he groaned un|der,
could have prevailed upon the daughter to
part with it: But exclu&s;ive of other motives, the
very image it&s;elf, by recalling to her mind the
honours of her name, upbraided her with living
in dependence upon a man, who had treated her
with &s;uch indignity and ingratitude; be&s;ides, &s;he
flattered her&s;elf with the hope that &s;he &s;hould
not long &s;urvive the lo&s;s of this te&s;timonial.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, with many profe&s;&s;ions of &s;or|row
and mortification at his own want of capa|city,
to prevent &s;uch an alienation, undertook
<PB N="52" REF="83">
to di&s;po&s;e of it to the be&s;t advantage, and to pro|vide
her with a cheap and retired apartment, to
which he would conduct her in &s;afety, tho' at
the hazard of his life. In the mean time, how|ever,
he repaired to his friend Renaldo; and af|ter
having admoni&s;hed him to arm his &s;oul with
patience and philo&s;ophy, declared that Moni|mia's
guilty pa&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf, could no longer
be kept within bounds: that &s;he had conjured
him, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her
in e&s;caping from an hou&s;e which &s;he con&s;idered
as the wor&s;t of dungeons, becau&s;e &s;he was in it
daily expo&s;ed to the &s;ight and company of
a man whom &s;he dete&s;ted; and that &s;he had
bribed him to compliance with her reque&s;t, not
only with repeated promi&s;es of eternal love and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o with the picture of her fa|ther
&s;et with diamonds, which &s;he had hitherto
re&s;erved as the la&s;t and greate&s;t te&s;timony of her
affection and e&s;teem</P>
<P>With the&s;e words, he pre&s;ented the fatal
pledge to the eyes of the a&s;toni&s;hed youth, upon
whom it operated like the poi&s;onous $ight of the
ba&s;ili&s;k; for, in an in&s;tant, the whole pa&s;&s;ions of
his &s;oul were in the mo&s;t violent agitation.
&startq;What! (cried he, in an exta&s;y of rage) is &s;he
&s;o abandoned to per&s;idy, &s;o lo&s;t to &s;hame, &s;o
damned to con&s;tancy, to gratitude and virtuous
love, as to meditate the means of leaving me
without decency, without remor&s;e! to for&s;ake
me in my adver&s;ity, when my haple&s;s fortune
can no longer flatter the pride and vanity of her
expectation! O woman! woman! woman!
what &s;imile &s;hall I find to illu&s;trate the character
of the &s;ex; but I will not have recour&s;e to
vain complaints and feeble exclamations. By
<PB N="83" REF="84">
heaven! &s;he &s;hall not &s;cape; &s;he &s;hall not tri|umph
in her levity&mdash;&s;he &s;hall not exult in my di|&s;tre&s;s:
No! I will rather &s;acrifice her to my ju&s;t
re&s;entment, to the injured powers of love and
friend&s;hip. I will act the avenging mini&s;ter of
heaven! I will mangle that fair bo&s;om which
contains &s;o fal&s;e an heart! I will tear her to
pieces, and &s;catter tho&s;e beauteous limbs, as a
prey to the bea&s;ts of the field, and the &s;owls of
the air!&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom, who expected this &s;torm, far from
attempting to oppo&s;e its progre&s;s, waited with
patience until its fir&s;t violence was overblown,
then a&s;&s;uming an air of condolance, animated
with that re&s;olution which a friend ought to
maintain on &s;uch occa&s;ions: &startq;My dear count
(&s;aid he) I am not at all &s;urprized at your emo|tion,
becau&s;e I know what an heart, &s;u&s;ceptible
as yours, mu&s;t feel, from the apo&s;tacy of one who
has reigned &s;o long the object of your love, ad|miration,
and e&s;teem. Your endeavours to
drive her from your thoughts, mu&s;t create an
agony much more &s;evere, than that which
divorces the &s;oul from the body. Neverthele&s;s, I
am &s;o confident of your virtue and your man|hood,
as to fore&s;ee that you will allow the frail
Monimia to execute that re&s;olution which &s;he
hath &s;o unwi&s;ely taken to withdraw her&s;elf from
your love and protection. Believe me, my be&s;t
friend and benefactor, this is a &s;top, in con&s;e|quence
of which you will infallibly retrieve your
peace of mind. It may co&s;t you many bitter
pangs, it may probe your wounds to the quick;
but tho&s;e pangs will be &s;oothed by the gentle and
&s;alutary wing of time, and that probing will rou&s;e
you to a due &s;en&s;e of your own dignity and im|portance,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
which will enable you to convert your
attention to objects far more worthy of your
contemplation. All the hopes of happine&s;s you
had cheri&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Monimia, are
now irrecoverably bla&s;ted; her heart is now de|ba&s;ed
beneath your con&s;ideration; her love is,
without all doubt, extingui&s;hed, and her honour
irretrievably lo&s;t; in&s;omuch, that were &s;he to
pro&s;e&s;s &s;orrow for her indi&s;cretion, and implore
your forgivene&s;s, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es
of regarding you for the future with unalterable
fidelity and affection, you ought not to re&s;tore
her to that place in your heart which &s;he hath &s;o
meanly forfeited; becau&s;e you could not at the
&s;ame time rein&s;tate her in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
delicate e&s;teem without which there is no harmo|ny,
no rapture, no true enjoyment in love. No,
my dear Renaldo, expel the unworthy tenant
from your bo&s;om; allow her to fill up the mea|&s;ure
of her ingratitude, by de&s;erting her lover,
friend and benefactor. Your glory demands her
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; the would will applaud your genero|&s;ity,
and your own heart approve of your con|duct:
So di&s;incumbered, let us exert our&s;elves
once more in promoting your departure from
this i&s;land, that you may revi&s;it your father's hou&s;e,
do ju&s;tice to your &s;elf and amiable &s;i&s;ter, and
take vengeance on the author of your wrongs;
then dedicate your&s;elf to glory, in imitation of
your renowned ance&s;tors, and flouri&s;h in the fa|vour
of your imperial patron.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances had &s;uch effect upon the
Hungarian, that his face was lighted up with a
tran&s;ient gleam of &s;atisfaction; he embraced
Ferdinand with great ardour, calling him his
pride, his Mentor, his good genius, and intreated
<PB N="85" REF="86">
him to gratify the inclination of that fickle crea|ture,
&s;o far as to convey her to another lodging,
without lo&s;s of time, while he would, by ab&s;ent|ing
him&s;elf, favour their retreat.</P>
<P>Our hero having obtained this permi&s;&s;ion, went
immediately to the &s;kirts of the town, where he
had previou&s;ly be&s;poke a &s;mall, tho' neat apart|ment,
at the hou&s;e of an old woman, widow of a
French refugee: he had already reconnoitred the
ground, by founding his landlady, from who&s;e
poverty and complai&s;ance he found rea&s;on to ex|pect
all &s;orts of freedom and opportunity for the
accompli&s;hment of his aim upon Monimia's per|&s;on.
The room being prepared for her recepti|on,
he returned to that di&s;con&s;olate beauty, to
whom he pre&s;ented ten guineas, which he pre|tended
to have rai&s;ed by pledging the picture;
though he him&s;elf acted as the pawn-broker on
this occa&s;ion, for a very plain and ovious rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The fair orphan was overjoyed to find her wi&s;h
&s;o &s;peedily accompli&s;hed: &s;he forthwith packed
up her nece&s;&s;aries in a trunk; and an hackney|coach
was called in the du&s;k of the evening, in
which &s;he imbarked with her baggage and con|ductor.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he did not leave the habitation of Renaldo
without regret. In the in&s;tant of parting, the
idea of that unfortunate youth was a&s;&s;ociated with
every well known object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to
her eyes; not as an incon&s;tant, ungenerous and
perjured &s;wain, but as the accompli&s;hed, the vir|tuous,
the melting lover, who had captivated her
virgin heart. As Fathom led her to the door,
&s;he was met by Renaldo's dog, which had long
been her favourite, and the poor animal fawning
upon her as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, her heart was over|whelmed
<PB N="86" REF="87">
with &s;uch a gu&s;h of tenderne&s;s, that a
flood of tears &s;treamed down her cheeks, and &s;he
had well nigh &s;unk upon the floor.</P>
<P>Ferdinand con&s;idering this emotion as the la&s;t
tribute &s;he would pay to Renaldo, hurried her
into the coach, where &s;he &s;oon recovered her
compo&s;ure; and in a little time he u&s;hered her in|to
the hou&s;e of madam la Mer, by whom &s;he was
received with great cordiality, and conducted to
her apartment, with which &s;he found no other
fault, but that of its being too good for one in
her forlorn &s;ituation: here, while the tear of gra|titude
&s;tarted in either eye, &s;he thanked our ad|venturer
for his benevolence and kind concern,
a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he would not fail daily to be|&s;eech
the Mo&s;t High to &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings
upon him, as the orphan's friend and protector.</P>
<P>Fathom was not deficient in tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions
that were be&s;t adapted to her pre&s;ent turn of
mind: he ob&s;erved, that what he had done, was
in obedience to the dictates of common humani|ty,
which would have prompted him to a&s;&s;i&s;t
any fellow-creature in di&s;tre&s;s; but that her pe|culiar
virtue and qualifications were &s;uch as chal|lenged
the utmo&s;t exertion of his faculties in her
&s;ervice: he &s;aid, that &s;urely Heaven had not
created &s;uch perfection in vain; that &s;he was de&s;|tined
to receive as well as to communicate hap|pine&s;s;
and that the Providence which &s;he &s;o
piou&s;ly adored, would not fail, in due &s;ea&s;on, to
rai&s;e her from di&s;tre&s;s and affliction, to that ho|nour
and felicity for which &s;he was certainly or|dained:
in the mean time he intreated her to de|pend
upon his &s;ervice and fidelity, and the article
of her board being &s;ettled, he left her to the com|pany
and con&s;olation of her di&s;creet ho&s;te&s;s, who
<PB N="87" REF="88">
&s;oon in&s;inuated her&s;elf into the good opinion of
her beauteous lodger.</P>
<P>While our hero was employed in this tran&s;ac|tion,
Renaldo &s;allied forth in a &s;ort of intoxica|tion,
which Fathom's admonitions had in&s;pired;
and repairing to a certain noted coffee-hou&s;e, en|gaged
at che&s;s with an old French refugee, that
his attention, by being otherwi&s;e employed, might
not &s;tray towards that fatal object which he ar|dently
wi&s;hed to forget. But, unluckily for him,
he had &s;carce performed three moves of the game,
when his ears were expo&s;ed to a dialogue between
two young gentlemen; one of whom a&s;ked the
other if he would go and &s;ee the orphan acted at
one of the theatres; ob&s;erving, as a farther in|ducement,
that the part of Monimia would be
performed by a young gentlewoman who had ne|ver
appeared on the &s;tage. At mention of that
name Renaldo &s;tarted: for, tho' it did not pro|perly
belong to his orphan, it was the appellation
by which &s;he had been di&s;tingui&s;hed ever &s;ince her
&s;eparation from her father's hou&s;e; and therefore,
it recalled her to his imagination in the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting
point of view. Though he endeavoured
to expel the image, by a clo&s;er application to his
play, every now and then it intruded upon his
fancy, and at each return made a &s;tronger im|pre&s;&s;ion;
&s;o that he found him&s;elf in the &s;ituation
of an unfortunate bark &s;tranded upon &s;ome hidden
rock, which, when the wind begins to blow, feels
every &s;ucceeding wave more boi&s;terous than the
former, until, with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, they &s;urmount
her decks, &s;weep every thing before them, and
da&s;h her all to pieces.</P>
<P>The refugee had ob&s;erved his fir&s;t emotion,
which he attributed to an unfore&s;een advantage he
<PB N="88" REF="89">
him&s;elf had gained over the Hungarian: but &s;ee|ing
him, in the &s;equel, bite his lip, roll his eyes,
groan, writhe his body, ejaculate incoherent
cur&s;es, and neglect his game, the Huguenot con|cluded,
that he was mad; and, being &s;eized
with terror and di&s;may, got up and &s;campered off
without ceremony or he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Melvil, thus left to the horrors of his own
thought, which tortured him with the apprehen|&s;ion
of lo&s;ing Monimia for ever, could no longer
combat that &s;ugge&s;tion, but ran homewards with
all the &s;peed he could exert, in order to prevent
her retreat. When he cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold, he
was &s;truck with &s;uch a damp of pre&s;aging fear,
that he dur&s;t not in per&s;on approach her apart|ment,
nor even, by que&s;tioning the &s;ervant, in|form
him&s;elf of the particulars he wanted to
know: yet his &s;u&s;pence becoming more in|&s;upportable
than his fear, he ru&s;hed from room
to room in que&s;t of that which was not to be
found; and, &s;eeing Monimia's chamber-door
open, entered the de&s;erted temple in a &s;tate of
di&s;traction, calling aloud upon her name. All
was &s;ilent, &s;olitary, and wo&s;ul, &startq;She is gone&mdash;(he
cried, &s;hedding a flood of tears)&mdash;&s;he is for
ever lo&s;t; and all my hopes of happine&s;s are fled!&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;unk upon that couch on which
Monimia had oft repo&s;ed, and abandoned him&s;elf
to all the exce&s;s of grief and de&s;pondence. In
this deplorable condition he was found by our ad|venturer,
who gently chid him for his want of
re&s;olution, and again repelled his &s;orrow, by
arou&s;ing his re&s;entment again&s;t the innocent cau&s;e
of his di&s;quiet, having before hand forged the par|ticulars
of provocation. &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;that Renaldo can &s;till retain the lea&s;t &s;en|timent
<PB N="89" REF="90">
of regard for a &s;ickle woman, by whom
he has been &s;o ungratefully for&s;aken and &s;o unju&s;tly
&s;corned? Is it po&s;&s;ible he can be &s;o di&s;turbed by
the lo&s;s of a creature who is her&s;elf lo&s;t to all
virtue and decorum?&mdash;Time and reflection, my
worthy friend, will cure you of that inglorious
malady: and the future mi&s;conduct of that im|prudent
dam&s;el will, doubtle&s;s, contribute to the
recovery of your peace. Her behaviour at leaving
the hou&s;e where &s;he had received &s;o many marks of
the mo&s;t delicate affection, was in all re&s;pects &s;o op|po&s;ite
to honour and decency, that I could &s;carce
refrain from telling her I was &s;hocked at her de|portment,
even while &s;he loaded me with prote&s;|tations
of love. When a woman's heart is once
depraved, &s;he bids adieu to all re&s;traint;&mdash;&s;he
pre&s;erves no mea&s;ures. It was not &s;imply con|tempt
which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for Renaldo; &s;he
&s;eems to re&s;ent his being able to live under her
di&s;dain; and that re&s;entment &s;toops to objects un|worthy
of indignation. Even your dog was not
exempted from the effects of her di&s;plea&s;ure: for,
in her pa&s;&s;age to the door, &s;he kicked the poor
animal as one of your dependants; and in our
way to the apartment I had provided for her, &s;he
entertained me with a ludicrous comment upon
the manner in which you fir&s;t made her acquaint|ed
with your pa&s;&s;ion. All that mode&s;ty of car|riage,
all that cha&s;tity of conver&s;ation, all that
dignity of grief, which &s;he knew &s;o well how to
affect, is now entirely laid a&s;ide, and when I
quitted her, &s;he &s;eemed the mo&s;t gay, giddy and
impertinent of her &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gracious powers! (exclaimed Renaldo,
&s;tarting from the couch) am I under the delu&s;ion
of a dream; or are the&s;e things really &s;o, as my
<PB N="90" REF="91">
friend has repre&s;ented them? Such a total and
&s;udden degeneracy is amazing! is mon&s;trous and
unnatural!&endq;&mdash;&mdash;&startq;Such, my dear Count,&endq; re|plied
our hero, &startq;is the caprice of a female heart,
fickle as the wind, uncertain as a calm at &s;ea,
fixed to no principle, but &s;wayed by every &s;an|ta&s;tic
gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, or of whim. Congratu|late
your&s;elf, therefore, my friend, upon your
happy deliverance from &s;uch a dome&s;tic plague&mdash;
upon the voluntary exile of a traitor from your
bo&s;om:&mdash;recollect the dictates of your duty, your
di&s;cretion, and your glory, and think upon the
honours and elevated enjoyment for which you
are certainly ordained. To night, let us over a
chearful bottle anticipate your &s;ucce&s;s; and to|morrow
I will accompany you to the hou&s;e of an

<P>IN this manner did the artful incendiary work
upon the pa&s;&s;ions of the credulous un&s;u&s;pect|ing
Hungarian, who pre&s;&s;ed him to his brea&s;t
with the mo&s;t cordial expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip,
calling him his guardian, his &s;aviour, his &s;econd
father, and gave him&s;elf up wholly to his ad|vice.</P>
<P>Next morning, according to the plan they had
laid over night, they repaired to a tavern in the
neighbourhood of the per&s;on to whom our adven|turer
had been directed, and were fortunate
<PB N="91" REF="92">
enough to find him in the hou&s;e, tran&s;acting a
money affair with a young gentleman who treat|ed
him with his morning's whet.</P>
<P>That affair being negotiated, he adjourned in|to
another room with Renaldo and his compani|on,
who were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee this
mini&s;ter of Plutus in the &s;hape of a young &s;prightly
beau, trimmed up in all the foppery of the fa&s;hion;
for they had hitherto always a&s;&s;ociated with the
idea of an u&s;urer, old age and ru&s;ty apparel.
After divers modi&s;h congees, he begged to know
to what he &s;hould attribute the honour of their
me&s;&s;age; when Ferdinand, who acted the ora|tor,
told him, that his friend Count Melvil, hav|ing
occa&s;ion for a &s;um of money, had been directed
to a gentleman of his name, &startq;and I &s;uppo&s;e,&endq;
added he, &startq;you are the &s;on of the per&s;on with
whom the affair is to be negotiated.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid this <HI>petit maitre,</HI> with a &s;mile,
I perceive you are &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee one of my
profe&s;&s;ion in the appearance of a gentleman; and
perhaps your wonder will not cea&s;e, when I tell
you, that my education was liberal, and that I
once had the honour to bear a commi&s;&s;ion in the
Briti&s;h army. I was indeed a fir&s;t lieutenant of
marines, and will venture to &s;ay, that no officer
in the &s;ervice was more delicate than my&s;elf, in
ob&s;erving all the punctilios of honour. I en|tertained
the utmo&s;t contempt for all the trading
part of the nation, and &s;uffered my&s;elf to be run
through the body in a duel, rather than roll with
a brother-lieutenant who was a broker's &s;on: but,
thank Heaven! I have long ago conquered all
tho&s;e ridiculous prejudices. I &s;oon ob&s;erved, that
without money there was no re&s;pect, honour, or
convenience to be acquired in life; that wealth
<PB N="92" REF="93">
amply &s;upplied the want of wit, merit and pedi|gree,
having influence and plea&s;ure ever at com|mand;
and that the world never failed to wor|&s;hip
the flood of affluence, without examining the
dirty channels thro' which it commonly flowed.</P>
<P>At the end of the war, finding my appoint|ments
reduced to two &s;hillings and four-pence
<HI>per</HI> day, and being addicted to plea&s;ures which I
could not po&s;&s;ibly purcha&s;e from &s;uch a fund, I
&s;old my half-pay for two hundred pounds, which
I lent upon bond to a young officer of the &s;ame
regiment, on condition that he &s;hould in&s;ure his
life, and re&s;tore one fourth pa$t of the &s;um by
way of premium. I happened to be lucky in
this fir&s;t e&s;tay: for the borrower, having in &s;ix
weeks expended the money, made an excur&s;ion
on the high-way, was apprehended, tried, con|victed
of felony, and cut his own throat, to prevent
the &s;hame of a public execution; &s;o that his bond
was di&s;charged by the in&s;urers.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, gentlemen, when I engaged in this
bu&s;ine&s;s, I determined to carry it on with &s;uch
&s;pirit, as would either make my fortune, or en|tirely
ruin me in a little time; and hitherto my
endeavours have been tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful: nor
do I think my proceedings a whit more criminal
or unju&s;t, than tho&s;e of other merchants, who
&s;trive to turn their money to the be&s;t account.
The commodity $word$ deal in is ca&s;h; and it is my
bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ell it to the be&s;t advantage. A Lon|don
factor &s;ends a cargo of goods to market, and
if he gets two hundred <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the &s;ale,
he is commended for his indu&s;try and addre&s;s.
If I &s;ell money for one fourth part of that pro|fit,
certain per&s;ons will be &s;o unju&s;t, as to cry,
Shame upon me, for taking &s;uch advantage of my
<PB N="93" REF="94">
neighbour's di&s;tre&s;s: not con&s;idering, that the
trader took four times the &s;ame advantage of tho&s;e
people who bought his cargo, tho' his ri&s;que was
not half &s;o great as mine; and although the mo|ney
I &s;old, perhaps retrieved the borrower from
the very jaws of de&s;truction: for example, it was
but ye&s;terday I &s;aved a worthy man from being
arre&s;ted for a &s;um of money, for which he had
bailed a friend who treacherou&s;ly le&s;t him in the
lurch: as he did not for&s;ee what would happen,
he had made no provi&s;ion for the demand, and
his &s;phere of life &s;ecluding him from all &s;orts of
money'd intercour&s;e, he could not rai&s;e the ca&s;h
by his credit in the u&s;ual way of borrowing; &s;o
that, without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he mu&s;t have gone
to jail; a di&s;grace which would have proved fatal to
the peace of his family, and utterly ruined his re|putation.
&mdash;Nay, that very young gentleman from
whom I ju&s;t now parted, will, in all probability,
be indebted to me for a very genteel livelihood.
He had obtained the ab&s;olute promi&s;e of being
provided for, by a great man, who fits at the
helm of affairs in a neighbouring kingdom; but
being de&s;titute of all other re&s;ources, he could
not have equipped him&s;elf for the voyage, in or|der
to profit by his lord&s;hip's intention, unle&s;s I
had enabled him to pur&s;ue his good fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo was not a little plea&s;ed to hear this
harrangue, to which Fathom replied with many
florid encomiums upon the u&s;urer's good &s;en&s;e
and humane di&s;po&s;ition: then he explained the
errand of his friend, which was to borrow three
hundred pounds, in order to retrieve his inheri|tance,
of which he had been defrauded in his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">
&startq;Sir, (&s;aid the lender, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to
Count Melvil), I pretend to have acquired by
experience &s;ome &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy; and tho'
there are &s;ome faces &s;o deeply di&s;gui&s;ed as to baffle
all the penetration of our art, there are others,
in which the heart appears with &s;uch nakedne&s;s
of integrity, as at once to recommend it to our
good will.&mdash;I own your countenance prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
me in your &s;avour; and you &s;hall be accommo|dated,
upon tho&s;e terms from which I never de|viate,
provided you can find proper &s;ecurity, that
you &s;hall not quit the Briti&s;h dominions, for that,
with me, is a condition <HI>&s;ine qua non.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>This was a very di&s;agreeable declaration to Re|naldo,
who candidly owned, that as his concerns
lay upon the continent, his purpo&s;e was to leave
England without delay. The u&s;urer profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf &s;orry that it was not in his power to ob|lige
him; and, in order to prevent any farther
opportunity, a&s;&s;ured them, he had laid it down
as a maxim, from which he would never &s;werve,
to avoid all dealings with people whom (if need
&s;hould be) he could not &s;ue by the laws of this
realm.</P>
<P>Thus the intervention of one unlucky and un|fore&s;een
circum&s;tance bla&s;ted, in an in&s;tant, the
budding hopes of Melvile, who, while his vi&s;age
exhibited the mo&s;t &s;orrowful di&s;appointment, beg|ged
to know, if there was any per&s;on of his ac|quaintance,
who might be le&s;s &s;crupulous in that
particular.</P>
<P>The young gentleman directed them to ano|ther
member of his profe&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hing them
&s;ucce&s;s, took his leave with great form and com|plai&s;ance.
This in&s;tance of politene&s;s was, how|ever,
no more than a &s;hift to di&s;ingage him&s;elf
<PB N="95" REF="96">
the more ea&s;ily from their intreaties: for, when
the ca&s;e was opened to the &s;econd u&s;urer, he
ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;uch cu&s;tomers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
them with the mo&s;t mortifying and boori&s;h refu|&s;al.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e repul&s;es, Renaldo
re&s;olved to make one de&s;perate pu&s;h; and, with|out
allowing him&s;elf the lea&s;t re&s;pite, &s;ollicited,
one by one, not fewer than fifteen per&s;ons who
dealt in this kind of traffic, and his propo&s;als
were rejected by each. At la&s;t, fatigued by the
toil, and exa&s;perated at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his expe|dition;
and half mad with the recollection of his
finances, which were now drained to half a crown,
&startq;Since we have nothing to expect,&endq; cried he,
&startq;from the favour of chri&s;tians, let us have re|cour&s;e
to the de&s;cendants of Judah. Tho' they
lie under the general reproach of nations, as a
people dead to virtue and benevolence, and wholly
devoted to avarice, fraud, and extortion, the mo&s;t
&s;avage of their tribe cannot treat me with more
barbarity of indifference, than I have experi|enced
among tho&s;e who are the authors of their
reproach.&endq;</P>
<P>Although Fathom looked upon this propo&s;al as
an extravagant &s;ymptom of de&s;pair, he affected
to approve of the &s;cheme, and encouraged Re|naldo
with the hope of &s;ucceeding in another
quarter, even if this expedition &s;hould fail: for,
by this time, our adventurer was half re&s;olved to
export him at his own change, rather than he
&s;hould be much longer re&s;tricted in his de&s;igns
upon Monimia.</P>
<P>Mean while, being re&s;olved to try the experi|ment
upon the children of I&s;rael, they betook
them&s;elves to the hou&s;e of a rich Jew, who&s;e
wealth they con&s;idered as a proof of his rapaciou&s;|ne&s;s;
<PB N="96" REF="97">
and, being admitted into his compting-hou&s;e,
they found him, in the mid&s;t of half a
dozen clerks, when Renaldo, in his imagination,
likened him unto a mini&s;ter of darkne&s;s &s;ur|rounded
by his familiars, and planning &s;chemes
of mi&s;ery to be executed upon the haple&s;s &s;ons of
men. In &s;pite of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, which were
not at all mitigated by the forbidding a&s;pect of
the Hebrew, he demanded a private audience;
and, being u&s;hered into another apartment, he ex|plained
his bu&s;ine&s;s with manife&s;t marks of di&s;or|der
and affliction. Indeed his confu&s;ion was in
&s;ome mea&s;ure owing to the looks of the Jew, who
in the mid&s;t of his exordium pulled down his eye|brows,
which were &s;urpri&s;ingly black and bu&s;hy,
&s;o as, in appearance, totally to extingui&s;h his
vi&s;ion, tho' he was all the time ob&s;erving our youth
from behind tho&s;e almo&s;t impenetrable thickets.</P>
<P>Melvil having &s;ignified his reque&s;t, &startq;Young
gentleman, (&s;aid the I&s;raelite, with a mo&s;t di&s;|cordant
voice), what in the name of goodne&s;s,
could induce you to come to me, upon &s;uch an
errand? Did you ever hear that I lent money to
&s;trangers, without &s;ecurity?&endq; &startq;No,&endq; replied
Renaldo; &startq;nor did I believe I &s;hould profit by my
application: but my affairs are de&s;perate; and my
propo&s;als having been rejected by every Chri&s;tian
to whom they were offered, I was re&s;olved to try
my &s;ate among the Jews, who are reckoned ano|ther
&s;pecies of men.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom, alarmed at this abrupt reply, which
he &s;uppo&s;ed could not fail to di&s;gu&s;t the merchant,
interpo&s;ed in the conver&s;ation, by making an apo|logy
for the plain dealing of his friend, who, he
&s;aid, was &s;oured and ruffled by his misfortunes:
then exerting that power of eloquence which he
<PB N="97" REF="98">
had at command, he expo&s;tulated upon Renaldo's
claim and expectations, de&s;cribed the wrongs he
had &s;uffered, extolled his virtue, and drew a mo&s;t
pathetic picture of his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Jew li&s;tened attentively for &s;ome time;
then his eye-brows began to ri&s;e and fall alter|nately;
he cough'd, &s;neez'd, and winking hard,
&startq;I'm plagued,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;with a &s;alt rheum
that trickles from my eyes without intermi&s;&s;ion.&endq;
So &s;aying, he wiped the moi&s;ture from his face,
and proceeded in the&s;e words: &startq;Sir, your &s;tory
is plau&s;ible; and your friend is a good advocate:
but, before I give an an&s;wer to your demand, I
mu&s;t beg leave to a&s;k if you can produce unde|niable
evidence of your being the identical per&s;on
you really a&s;&s;ume. If you are really the Count
de Melvil, you will excu&s;e my caution: we can|not
be too much on our guard again&s;t fraud;
tho' I mu&s;t own you have not the air of an im|po&s;tor.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo's eyes began to &s;parkle at this preli|minary
que&s;tion; to which he replied, that he
could procure the te&s;timony of the Emperor's mi|ni&s;ter,
to whom he had occa&s;ionally paid his re|&s;pects
&s;ince his fir&s;t arrival in England.</P>
<P>&startq;If that be the ca&s;e,&endq; &s;aid the Jew, &startq;take
the trouble to call here to-morrow morning at
eight o'clock, and I will carry you in my own
coach to the hou&s;e of his excellency, with whom
I have the honour to be acquainted; and, if he
has nothing to object again&s;t your character, or
preten&s;ions, I will contribute my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to|wards
your obtaining ju&s;tice at the imperial
court.&endq;</P>
<P>The Hungarian was &s;o much confounded at
this unexpected reception, that he had not power
<PB N="98" REF="99">
to thank the merchant for his promi&s;ed favour,
but &s;tood motionle&s;s and &s;ilent, while the &s;treams
of gratitude ran down his cheeks. This genuine
emotion of the heart was of more weight with
the Jew, than the eloquent acknowledgment
which Ferdinand took the opportunity of making
for his friend; and he was fain to di&s;mi&s;s them a
little abruptly, in order to prevent a &s;econd di&s;|charge
of that &s;ame rheum of which he had al|ready
complained.</P>
<P>Melvil recollected all that had happened as a
dream, which had no foundation in truth, and was
all day long in a &s;ort of delirium, produced by the
alternate gu&s;ts of hope and fear that &s;till agitated
his bo&s;om: for he was not yet without apprehen|&s;ion
of being again di&s;appointed by &s;ome unlucky
occurrence.</P>
<P>He did not, however, fail to be punctual to
the hour of his appointment, when the Jew told
him, there would be no occa&s;ion for vi&s;iting the
amba&s;&s;ador, becau&s;e Renaldo had been, the pre|ceding
day, recogni&s;ed by one of the clerks who
had been employed as a purveyor in the impe|rial
army; and who, knowing his family, con|firmed
every thing he had alledged. &startq;After
breakfa&s;t,&endq; continued this benevolent I&s;raelite,
&startq;I will give you an order upon my banker for
five hundred pounds, that you may be enabled to
appear at Vienna, as the &s;on and repre&s;entative
of Count Melvil; and you &s;hall al&s;o be furni&s;hed
with a letter of recommendation to a per&s;on of
&s;ome influence at that court, who&s;e friend&s;hip and
countenance may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to your &s;uit:
for I am now heartily engaged in your intere&s;t,
in con&s;equence of the fair and unblemi&s;hed cha|racter
which I find you have hitherto maintained.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">
The reader mu&s;t appeal to his own heart, to
acquire a ju&s;t idea of Renaldo's feelings, when
every tittle of the&s;e promi&s;es was fulfilled, and the
merchant refu&s;ed to take one farthing by way of
premium, contenting him&s;elf with the &s;lender &s;e|curity
of a per&s;onal bond. He was, in truth,
overwhelmed with the obligation, and certainly
di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that his benefactor was &s;ome|thing
more than human. As for Fathom, his
&s;entiments took a different turn; and he &s;crupled
not to impute all this kindne&s;s to &s;ome deep-laid
intere&s;ted &s;cheme, the &s;cope of which he could
not at pre&s;ent comprehend.</P>
<P>After the tumults of the young gentleman's joy
had &s;ub&s;ided, and he found him&s;elf ea&s;ed of that
burthen&s;ome poverty, under which he had groaned
&s;o long; his thoughts, which before were di&s;&s;i|pated
upon the various circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s,
began to collect them&s;elves in a body, and to re|&s;ume
their deliberations upon a &s;ubject which they
had been long accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider; this was
no other than the forlorn Monimia, who&s;e idea
now emerged in his bo&s;om, being di&s;encumbered
of one part of the load by which it had been de|pre&s;&s;ed.
He mentioned her name to Fathom,
with marks of the mo&s;t melting compa&s;&s;ion, de|plored
her apo&s;ta&s;y; and, while he prote&s;ted that
he had divorced her for ever from his heart, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
an inclination to &s;ee her once more, be|fore
his departure, that he might in per&s;on ex|hort
her to penitence and reformation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who dreaded &s;uch an inter|view
as the infallible means of his own ruin, re|&s;i&s;ted
the propo&s;al with the whole power of his
elocution. He affirmed, that Renaldo's de&s;ire
was a manife&s;t proof that he &s;till retained part of
<PB N="100" REF="101">
the fatal poi&s;on which that inchantre&s;s had &s;pread
within his veins, and that the &s;ight of her, &s;oftened
by his reproaches into tears and affected contri|tion,
would di&s;pel his re&s;entment, di&s;able his man|hood,
and blow the embers of his former pa&s;&s;ion
to &s;uch a rage, as would hurry him on to a re|conciliation,
which would deba&s;e his honour, and
ruin his future peace. In a word, Ferdinand de|&s;cribed
the danger that would attend the meeting,
in &s;uch emphatic terms, that the Hungarian &s;tarted
with horror at the picture which he drew, and in
this particular conformed with the admonition of
his friend.</P>
<P>One hundred pounds of the Jew's money was
immediately appropriated for the payment of his
mo&s;t urgent debts; the like &s;um he pre&s;ented to his
friend Fathom, with a &s;olemn promi&s;e of &s;haring
with him whatever good fortune might await him
in Germany: and tho' Monimia had forfeited all
title to his regard, &s;o ill could he bear the pro&s;pect
of her di&s;tre&s;s, that he entru&s;ted his dear compa|nion
with the half of what remained, to be ex|pended
for her u&s;e, fully re&s;olving to &s;creen her
from the &s;hocks and temptations of want, as the
circum&s;tances of his future fate would allow.</P>
<P>Fathom, far from oppo&s;ing, applauded his ge|nero&s;ity
with marks of extreme wonder and ad|miration,
a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he &s;hould be put in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bounty, immediately after his de|parture,
he being unwilling to make her acquaint|ed
with her good fortune before that period, le&s;t
finding his affairs in a fair way of being retrieved,
&s;he &s;hould be ba&s;e enough to wor&s;hip his returning
pro&s;perity, and, by fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, and artful
blandi&s;hments, &s;eek to en&s;nare his heart anew.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Count Fathom unma&s;ks his battery; is repul&s;ed;
and varies his operations without effect.</HEAD>
<P>EVery nece&s;&s;ary preparation being made, Re|naldo,
accompanied by our adventurer, took
the road to Dover, where he embarked in a pac|ket
boat for Calais, after having &s;ettled a corre|&s;pondence
with his dear Ferdinand, from whom
he did not part without tears. He had before
&s;ollicited him to be his fellow-traveller, that he might per&s;onally enjoy the benefit of his conver|&s;ation,
and &s;uperior &s;agacity; but the&s;e intreaties
he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, on pretence of his being
determined to pu&s;h his fortune in England, which
he con&s;idered as his native country, and as the
land in which (of all others) a man of merit has
the be&s;t encouragement. Such were the rea&s;ons
he alledged, for refu&s;ing to attend his benefactor,
who was him&s;elf eagerly de&s;irous of attaining a
&s;ettlement in the i&s;land of Great Britain: but our
hero's real motives for &s;taying were of a very
different complexion.&mdash;The reader is already in|formed
of his aim upon the fair orphan, which,
at pre&s;ent, was the chief &s;pring of his conduct:
he may al&s;o recollect &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of his life, as
were &s;ufficient to deter him from re-appearing at
Pre&s;burg or Vienna: but, be&s;ides the&s;e reflexions,
he was detained by a full per&s;ua&s;ion that Renaldo
would &s;ink under the power and influence of his
antagoni&s;t, con&s;equently be rendered incapable to
provide for his friends; and that he him&s;elf,
fraught with wiles and experience, as he was,
could not fail to make him&s;elf amends for what
<PB N="102" REF="103">
he had &s;uffered among a people equally rich and
unthinking.</P>
<P>Melvil having embraced our adventurer, and
with a deep &s;igh bid him take care of the unfor|tunate
Monimia, committed him&s;elf to the &s;ea,
and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a favourable gale, was,
in four hours, &s;afely landed on the French &s;hore;
while Fathom took po&s;t-hor&s;es for London, where
he arrived that &s;ame night, and next day, in the
forenoon, went to vi&s;it the beauteous mourner,
who had as yet received no intimation of Renal|do's
departure or de&s;ign. He found her in the
attitude of writing a letter to her incon&s;tant lover,
the contents of which the reader will be acquainted
with in due time. Her countenance, notwith|&s;tanding
the veil of melancholy by which it was
overca&s;t, &s;eemed altogether &s;erene and compo&s;ed;
&s;he was the picture of pious re&s;ignation, <HI>and &s;at
like</HI> PATIENCE <HI>on a monument, &s;miling at grief.</HI>
After having paid the compliment of the morn|ing,
Fathom begged pardon for having omitted to
vi&s;it her during three days, in which, he &s;aid, his
time had been wholly engro&s;&s;ed in procuring a
proper equipage for Count Melvil, who had at
la&s;t bid an eternal adieu to the i&s;land of Great
Britain.</P>
<P>At this information the haple&s;s Monimia fell
back in her chair, and continued &s;ome minutes
in a &s;woon; from which being recovered, &startq;Ex|cu&s;e
me, Mr. Fathom (cried &s;he, with a deep
&s;igh); this, I hope, is the la&s;t agony I &s;hall feel
from my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion.&endq;&mdash;Then wiping the
tears from her lovely eyes, &s;he retrieved her tran|quillity,
and de&s;ired to know by what means Re|naldo
had been enabled to undertake his journey
into the empire. Our hero, upon this occa&s;ion,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
a&s;&s;umed the whole merit of having promoted the
intere&s;t of his friend, by giving her to under|&s;tand,
that he, in con&s;equence of an unfore&s;een
windfall had defrayed the expence of the Count's
equipment; though he ob&s;erved, that it was not
without reluctance he &s;aw Renaldo make a wrong
u&s;e of his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>&startq;Although I was happy (proceeded this artful
traitor) in being able to di&s;charge my obligations
to the hou&s;e of Melvil, I could not help feeling
the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible chagrin, when I &s;aw my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the triumphs of the
youth's ba&s;ene&s;s and infidelity; for he cho&s;e, as
the companion of his travels, the abandoned wo|man,
for whom he had for&s;aken the all-perfect
Monimia, who&s;e virtue and accompli&s;hments did
not pre&s;erve her &s;acred from his ungrateful &s;ar|ca&s;ms
and unmannerly ridicule. Believe me,
madam, I was &s;o &s;hocked at his conver&s;ation on
that &s;ubject, and &s;o much incen&s;ed at his want of
delicacy, that my temper was &s;carce &s;ufficient for
the ceremony of parting: and now that my debt
to his family is overpaid, I have &s;olemnly re|nounced
his corre&s;pondence.&endq;</P>
<P>When &s;he heard that, in&s;tead of betraying the
lea&s;t &s;ymptom of regret or compa&s;&s;ion for her
unhappy fate, the perfidious youth had exulted
over her fall, and even made her a &s;ubject for his
mirth, the blood revi&s;ited her faded cheeks, and
re&s;entment re&s;tored to her eyes that poignancy
which &s;orrow had before overcome. Yet &s;he
&s;corn'd to give &s;peech to her indignation; but,
forcing a &s;mile, &startq;Why &s;hould I repine,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, &startq;at the mortifications of a life which I de|&s;pi&s;e,
and from which, I hope, Heaven will
&s;peedily &s;et me free!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
Fathom, fired by her emotion, which had re|called
all the graces of her beauty, exclaimed in
a rapture, &startq;$alk not &s;o contemptuou&s;ly of this
life, which hath &s;till a fund of happine&s;s in &s;tore
for the amiable, the divine Monimia. Though
one admirer hath proved an apo&s;tate to his vows,
your candour will not &s;uffer you to condemn the
whole &s;ex. Some there are, who&s;e bo&s;oms glow
with pa&s;&s;ion equally pure, unalterable and inten&s;e.
For my own part, I have &s;acrificed to a rigid
punctilio of honour the deare&s;t ideas of my heart.
I beheld your unrivalled charms, and deeply felt
their power: yet, while a po&s;&s;ibility of Melvil's
reformation remained, and while I was re&s;trained
by my niggard fortune, from making a tender
worthy of your acceptance, I combated with my
inclinations, and bore without repining the pangs
of hopele&s;s love. But, now that my honour is
di&s;engaged, and my fortune rendered independ|ent,
by the la&s;t will of a worthy nobleman,
who&s;e friend&s;hip I was favoured with in France,
I pre&s;ume to lay my&s;elf at the feet of the adora|ble
Monimia, as the mo&s;t faithful of admirers,
who&s;e happine&s;s or mi&s;ery wholly depends upon
her nod. Believe me, Madam, the&s;e are not
the profe&s;&s;ions of idle gallantry&mdash;I &s;peak the ge|nuine,
though imperfect, language of my heart:
words even the mo&s;t pathetic cannot do ju&s;tice
to my love. I gaze upon your beauty with ra|vi&s;hment;
but, I contemplate the graces of your
&s;oul with &s;uch awful veneration, that I tremble
while I approach you, as if my vows were ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to &s;ome &s;uperior being.&endq;</P>
<P>During this declaration, which was pronounced
in the mo&s;t emphatic manner, Monimia was &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
agitated with &s;hame, anger and grief;
<PB N="105" REF="106">
neverthele&s;s, &s;he &s;ummoned her whole philo&s;o|phy
to her aid, and with a tranquil, though de|termined
air, begged he would not dimini&s;h the
obligations he had already conferred, by di&s;turb|ing
with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable addre&s;&s;es, a poor un|happy
maid, who had detached all her thoughts
from earthly objects, and waited impatiently for
that di&s;&s;olution which alone could put a period to
her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Fathom, imagining that the&s;e were no other
than the &s;ugge&s;tions of a temporary di&s;appoint|ment
and de&s;pondence, which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s
to oppo&s;e with all his eloquence and art, renewed
his theme with redoubled ardour, and at la&s;t be|came
&s;o importunate in his de&s;ires, that Moni|mia,
provoked beyond the power of concealing
her re&s;entment, &s;aid, &s;he was heartily &s;orry to
find her&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of telling him,
that, in the mid&s;t of her misfortunes, &s;he could
not help remembering what &s;he had been. Then
ri&s;ing from her &s;eat with all the dignity of di&s;|plea&s;ure,
&startq;Perhaps,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;you have
forgot who was the father of the once happy
Monimia.&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he retired into another
chamber, leaving our adventurer confounded by
the repul&s;e he had &s;u&s;tained. Not that he was
di&s;couraged from pro&s;ecuting his aim: on the
contrary, this rebuff &s;eemed to add fre&s;h vigour
to his operations. He now thought it high time
to bring over Madam la Mer to his intere&s;t;
and, to facilitate her conver&s;ion, took an oppor|tunity
of bribing her with &s;ome incon&s;iderable
pre&s;ents, after having amu&s;ed her with a plau&s;i|ble
tale of his pa&s;&s;ion for Monimia, with whom
&s;he undertook the office of his mediatrix, on the
<PB N="106" REF="107">
&s;uppo&s;ition that his intentions were honourable
and highly advantageous to her lodger.</P>
<P>She was, fir&s;t of all, inve&s;ted with the office
of obtaining pardon for the offence he had given;
and in this negotiation &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, as
to become an advocate for his &s;uit: accordingly,
&s;he took all occa&s;ions of magnifying his prai&s;e.
His agreeable per&s;on was often the &s;ubject of her
di&s;cour&s;e to the fair mourner: her admiration
dwelt upon his politene&s;s, good &s;en&s;e and winning
deportment: and &s;he every day retailed little
&s;tories of his benevolence and greatne&s;s of &s;oul.
The defect in his birth &s;he repre&s;ented as a cir|cum&s;tance
altogether foreign from the con&s;idera|tion
of his merit; e&s;pecially in a nation where
&s;uch di&s;tinctions are as little re&s;pected as they will
be in a future &s;tate. She mentioned &s;everal per|&s;ons
of note, who ba&s;ked in the &s;un-&s;hine of
power and fortune, without having enjoyed the
lea&s;t hereditary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their fore-fathers.
One, &s;he &s;aid, &s;prung from the loins of an ob|&s;cure
attorney, another was the grand&s;on of a
valet de chambre, a third was the i&s;&s;ue of an ac|comptant,
and a fourth the off-pring of an
woolen-draper: all the&s;e were the children of
their own good works, and had rai&s;ed them&s;elves
upon their per&s;onal virtues and addre&s;s; a foun|dation
certainly more &s;olid and honourable, than
a vague inheritance derived from ance&s;tors, in
who&s;e de&s;erts they could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
bore the lea&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>Monimia li&s;tened to all the&s;e arguments with
great patience aud affability, though &s;he at once
dived into the &s;ource from which all &s;uch in&s;i|nuations
flowed: &s;he joined in the commenda|tions
of Fathom, and owned her&s;elf a particular
<PB N="107" REF="108">
in&s;tance of that benevolence which the old lady
had &s;o ju&s;tly extolled; but, once for all, to pre|vent
the &s;upplication which Madam la Mer was
about to make, &s;he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that her
heart was altogether &s;hut again&s;t any other earth|ly
engagement; and that her thoughts were alto|gether
employed upon her eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;iduous landlady perceiving the &s;teadine&s;s of
her di&s;po&s;ition, thought proper to alter her method
of proceeding, and, for the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pended that
theme by which &s;he found her fair lodger di&s;oblig|ed.
Re&s;olved to reconcile Monimia to life, before
&s;he would again recommend Ferdinand to her
love, &s;he endeavoured to amu&s;e her imagination,
by recounting the occa&s;ional incidents of the day,
hoping gradually to decoy her attention to tho&s;e
&s;ublunary objects from which it had been indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
weaned: &s;he &s;ea&s;oned her conver&s;ation with
agreeable &s;allies; enlarged upon the different
&s;cenes of plea&s;ure and diver&s;ion appertaining to
this great metropolis; practi&s;ed upon her palate,
with the delicacies of eating; endeavoured to
&s;hake her temperance with repeated proffers and
recommendations of certain cordials and re&s;to|ratives
which &s;he alledged were nece&s;&s;ary for the
recovery of her health; and pre&s;&s;ed her to make
little excur&s;ions into the fields that &s;kirt the town,
for the benefit of air and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>While this auxiliary plied the di&s;con&s;olate Moni|mia
on one hand, Fathom was not remi&s;s on the
other: he now &s;eemed to have &s;acrificed his pa&s;&s;ion
to her quiet; his di&s;cour&s;e turned upon more in|different
&s;ubjects; he endeavoured to di&s;pel her
melancholy with arguments drawn from philo&s;ophy
and religion: on &s;ome occa&s;ions, he di&s;played all his
<PB N="108" REF="109">
fund of good humour, with a view to beguile her
&s;orrow; he importuned her to give him the plea|&s;ure
of '&s;quiring her to &s;ome place of innocent
entertainment; and, finally, in&s;i&s;ted upon her ac|cepting
a pecuniary reinforcement to her finances,
which he knew to be in a mo&s;t con&s;umptive con|dition.</P>

<P>WITH that complacency and fortitude
which were peculiar to her&s;elf, this hap|le&s;s
&s;tranger re&s;i&s;ted all tho&s;e artful temptations.
Her &s;u&s;tenance was barely &s;uch as exempted her
from the guilt of being acce&s;&s;ory to her own
death; her drink was the &s;imple element: &s;he
encouraged no di&s;cour&s;e but that which turned
upon the concerns of her immortal part; &s;he ne|ver
went abroad except in vi&s;its to a French
chapel in the neighbourhood; &s;he refu&s;ed the
proffered a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our adventurer with equal
ob&s;tinacy and politene&s;s, and with plea&s;ure &s;aw
her&s;elf wa&s;ting towards that period of mortality
which was the con&s;ummation of her wi&s;h. Yet
her charms, far from melting away with her
con&s;titution, &s;eemed to triumph over the decays
of nature: her &s;hape and features &s;till retained
that harmony for which they had always been
di&s;tingui&s;hed: a mixture of maje&s;ty and &s;weetne&s;s
diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in her looks, and her feeblene&s;s ad|ded
to that &s;oft and feminine grace which attracts
the &s;ympathy, and engages the protection of every
humane beholder. The a&s;&s;ociates, thus baffled
<PB N="109" REF="110">
in their attempts to excite her ideas of plea&s;ure,
again &s;hifted their plan, and re&s;olved to attack
this forlorn beauty, on the &s;ide of fear and mor|tification.</P>
<P>Our adventurer became le&s;s frequent in his vi|&s;its,
and more indifferent in his language and de|portment;
while Madam la Mer gradually re|laxed
in that complacency and re&s;pect with which
&s;he had hitherto behaved towards her fair lodger.
She even began to drop hints of di&s;approbation
and reproach again&s;t this pattern of innocence
and beauty, and at length grew bold enough to
tell her, that her misfortunes could be attributed
to nothing but her own ob&s;tinacy and pride; that
&s;he had been at great pains to di&s;oblige the only
per&s;on who was able and willing to rai&s;e her above
dependance, and that if his protection &s;hould be
withdrawn, &s;he mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t
extremity of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;inuations, in&s;tead of producing the
de&s;ired effect, inflamed the indignation of Moni|nimia,
who, in a mo&s;t dignified &s;tile of rebuke,
chid her for her indelicacy and pre&s;umption, ob|&s;erving,
that &s;he could have no title to take &s;uch
freedoms with lodgers, who&s;e punctuality and re|gular
deportment left her no room to complain.
Notwith&s;tanding this animated reply, &s;he under|went
the mo&s;t deplorable angui&s;h, when &s;he re|flected
upon the in&s;olence of this woman, from
who&s;e barbarity &s;he had no re&s;ource; and &s;eeing
no other po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s, than that of appeal|ing
to the good offices of Fathom, &s;he conquered
her reluctance &s;o far, as to complain to him of
Madam la Mer's incivility.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with this application, he gave her to
under&s;tand, with very little ceremony or pream|ble,
<PB N="110" REF="111">
that it wholly depended upon her&s;elf, whe|ther
&s;he &s;hould continue to be wretched, or be
delivered at once from all her cares and perplexi|ty;
that, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;dain with which
&s;he had treated his addre&s;&s;es, he was &s;till ready to
lay him&s;elf and his fortune at her feet; and that
if &s;he &s;hould again reject the di&s;intere&s;ted propo|&s;al,
the whole world, and her own con&s;cience,
would charge upon her&s;elf, whatever calamities
&s;he might be &s;ubjected to in the &s;equel. Interpret|ing
into a favourable he&s;itation her &s;ilence, which
was the re&s;ult of wrath and amazement, he pro|ceeded
to throw him&s;elf at her feet, and utter a
romantic rhap&s;ody, in the cour&s;e of which,
laying a&s;ide all that re&s;traint which he had hither|to
pre&s;erved, he &s;eized her delicate hand, and
pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips; nay, &s;o far did he forget
him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion, that he caught the fair
creature in his arms, and rudely ravi&s;hed a ki&s;s
from tho&s;e lips which he had before contemplated
with the mo&s;t di&s;tant reverence of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Having thus broken down the fences of deco|rum,
and being heated with tran&s;port, he, in all
probability, would have acted the part of young
Tarquin, and violated, by force, that &s;acred

She broke from his dete&s;ted embrace, with &s;ur|pri&s;ing
agility, and called aloud to her landlady
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but that di&s;creet mation was re|&s;olved

pre&s;ented the point to his brea&s;t, and
while her eyes glanced with intolerable keenne&s;s,
&startq;Villain! (cried &s;he) the &s;pirit of my father
animates my bo&s;om, and the vengeance of heaven
&s;hall not be fru&s;trated.&endq; He was not &s;o much
affected by his bodily danger, as awe-&s;truck at
the manner of her addre&s;s, and the appearance of
her a&s;pect, which &s;eemed to &s;hine with &s;omething
&s;upernatural, and actually di&s;ordered his whole
faculties, in&s;omuch that he retreated without at|tempting
to make the lea&s;t reply; and &s;he having
&s;ecured the door after his departure, &s;at down to
ponder upon this &s;hocking event.</P>
<P>Words are wanting to de&s;cribe the accumu|lated
horrors that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind,
when &s;he thus beheld all her pre&s;aging fears rea|lized,
and found her&s;elf at the mercy of two
wretches, who had now pulled off the ma&s;k, after
having lo&s;t all &s;entiments of humanity. Common
affliction was an agreeable reverie to what &s;he
&s;uffered, deprived of her parents, exiled from her
friends and country, reduced to the brink of
wanting the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able nec$&s;&s;aries of life,
in a foreign land, where &s;he knew not one per|&s;on
to who&s;e protection &s;he could have recour&s;e,
from the inexpre&s;&s;ible woes that environed her:
&s;he complained to heaven, that her life was pro|tracted
for the augmentation of that mi&s;ery which
was already too &s;evere to be endured; for &s;he
<PB N="112" REF="113">
&s;huddered at the pro&s;pect of being utterly aban|doned
in the la&s;t &s;tage of mortality, without one
friend to clo&s;e her eyes, or do the la&s;t offices of
humanity to her breathle&s;s coar&s;e. The&s;e were
dreadful reflections to a young lady who had been
born to affluence and &s;plendor, trained up in all
the elegance of education, by nature fraught with
that &s;en&s;ibility which refines the &s;entiment and
ta&s;te, and &s;o tenderly cheri&s;hed by her indulgent
parents, that <HI>they &s;uffered not the winds of heaven
to vi&s;it her face too roughly.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;uch agony, &s;he
ro&s;e at day-break, and hearing the chapel bell toll
for morning prayers, re&s;olved to go to this place
of wor&s;hip, in order to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
heaven: &s;he no &s;ooner opened her chamber door,
with this intent, than &s;he was met by Madam
la Mer, who after having profe&s;&s;ed her concern
for what had happened over night, and imputed
Mr. Fathom's rudene&s;s to the &s;pirit of intoxica|tion,
by which &s;he had never before &s;een him
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade Monimia
from her purpo&s;e, by ob&s;erving, that her health
would be prejudiced by the cold morning air; but
finding her determined, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon accom|panying
her to chapel, on pretence of re&s;pect,
though, in reality, with a view to prevent the
e&s;cape of her beauteous lodger. Thus attended,
the haple&s;s mourner entered the place, and ac|cording
to the laudable ho&s;pitality of England,
which is the only country in Chri&s;tendom, where
a &s;tranger is not made welcome to the hou&s;e of
God; this amiable creature, emaciated and en|feebled
as &s;he was, mu&s;t have &s;tood in a common
pa&s;&s;age, during the whole &s;ervice, had not &s;he
been perceived by a humane gentlewoman, who,
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;truck with her beauty and dignified air, and
melted with &s;ympathy, at the ineffable &s;orrow
which was vi&s;ible in her countenance, opened the
pew in which &s;he &s;at, and accommodated Moni|mia
and her attendant: if &s;he was captivated by
her fir&s;t appearance, &s;he was not le&s;s affected by
the deportment of her fair gue&s;t, which was the
pattern of genuine devotion.</P>
<P>In a word, this good lady, who was a mer|chant's
widow in opulent circum&s;tances, was in|flamed
with a longing de&s;ire to know and be|friend
the amiable &s;tranger, who, after &s;ervice,
turning about to thank her for her civility, Ma|dam
Clement, with that frankne&s;s which is the
re&s;ult of true benevolence, told her, &s;he was too
much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, to let &s;lip this
opportunity of craving her acquaintance, and of
expre&s;&s;ing her inclination to alleviate (if po&s;&s;ible)
that affliction which was manife&s;t in her looks.</P>
<P>Monimia, overwhelmed with gratitude and
&s;urprize, at this unexpected addre&s;s, gazed upon
the lady in &s;ilence, and when &s;he repeated her
tenders of &s;ervice, could make no other reply to
her goodne&s;s, than by bur&s;ting into a flood of
tears: this was a &s;pecies of eloquence, which did
not pa&s;s unregarded by Madam Clement, who,
while her own eyes were bedewed with the drops
of &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion, took the lovely or|phan
by the hand, and led her, without further
ceremony, to her own coach, that &s;tood waiting
at the door, whither they were followed by Mrs.
La Mer, who was &s;o much confounded at the ad|venture,
that &s;he made no objections to the pro|po&s;al
of the lady who handed her lodger into the
carriage; but retired, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
to make Fathom acquainted with this unfore&s;een
event.</P>
<P>Mean while, the agitation of Monimia, at
this providential deliverance, was &s;uch as had well
nigh de&s;troyed her tender frame: the blood flu&s;h|ed
and for&s;ook her cheeks by turns; &s;he trem|bled
from head to foot, notwith&s;tanding the con|&s;olatory
a&s;&s;urances of Madam Clement, and,
without being able to utter one word, was con|ducted
to the hou&s;e of that kind benefactre&s;s,
where the violence of her tran&s;ports overpowered
her con&s;titution, and &s;he &s;unk down upon a coach
in a &s;woon, from which &s;he was not ea&s;ily reco|vered.
This affecting circum&s;tance augmented
the pity, and intere&s;ted the curio&s;ity of Madam
Clement, who concluded there was &s;omething
very extraordinary in the ca&s;e of the &s;tranger, to
produce the&s;e agonies; and grew impatient to
hear the particulars of her &s;tory.</P>
<P>Monimia no &s;ooner retrieved the u&s;e of her fa|culties,
than looking around, and ob&s;erving with
what humane concern her new ho&s;te&s;s was em|ployed
in effecting her recovery, &startq;Is this (&s;aid
&s;he) a flattering illu&s;ion of the brain? or am I
really under the protection of &s;ome beneficent
being, whom heaven hath in&s;pired with genero&s;i|ty,
to re&s;cue an haple&s;s &s;tranger from the mo&s;t
forlorn &s;tate of mi&s;ery and woe?&endq; Her voice
was, at all times, ravi&s;hingly &s;weet; and this ex|clamation
was pronounced with &s;uch pathetic fer|vour,
that Madam Clement cla&s;ped her in her
arms, and ki&s;&s;ing her with all the eagerne&s;s of
maternal affection, &startq;Yes, (cried &s;he) fair crea|ture,
heaven hath be&s;towed upon me an heart to
compa&s;&s;ionate, and power, I hope, to lighten the
burthen of your &s;orrows.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116">
She then prevailed upon her to take &s;ome nou|ri&s;hment,
and afterwards to recount the particu|lars
of her fate; a ta&s;k &s;he performed with &s;uch
accuracy and candour, that Madam Clement,
far from &s;u&s;pecting her &s;incerity, &s;aw truth and
conviction in every circum&s;tance of her tale;
and having condoled her misfortunes, entreated
her to forget them, or, at lea&s;t, look upon her&s;elf
as one &s;heltered under the care and tuition of a
per&s;on, who&s;e &s;tudy it would be to &s;upply her
want of natural parents. This would have been
an happy vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, had it not arrived
too late; but &s;uch a &s;udden and unlooked-for
tran&s;ition, not only di&s;ordered the faculties of
poor Monimia's mind, but al&s;o overp$wered the
organs of her body, already fatigued and enfee|bled
by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;he had undergone; &s;o that
&s;he was taken ill of a fever that &s;ame night, and
became delirious before morning, when a phy&s;i|cian
was called to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>While this gentleman was in the hou&s;e, Ma|dam
Clement was vi&s;ited by Fathom, who after
having complained, in the mo&s;t in&s;inuating man|ner,
that &s;he had encouraged his wife to abandon
her duty, told her a plau&s;ible &s;tory of his fir&s;t ac|quaintance
with Monimia, and his marriage at
the Fleet, which, he &s;aid, he was ready to prove,
by the evidence of the clergyman who joined
them, and that of Mrs. la Mer, who was pre&s;ent
at the ceremony. The good lady, although a
little &s;taggered at the genteel appearance, and en|gaging
addre&s;s of this &s;tranger, could not prevail
upon her&s;elf to believe that &s;he had been impo&s;ed
upon by her fair lodger, who, by this time, had
given too convincing a proof of her &s;incerity
neverthele&s;s, in order to prevent any di&s;pute th$
<PB N="116" REF="117">
might be prejudicial to the health or recovery of
Monimia, &s;he gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;he
would not, at pre&s;ent, enter upon the merits of
the cau&s;e, but only a&s;&s;ure him, that the young
lady was actually bereft of her &s;en&s;es, and in im|minent
danger of her life: for the truth of which
a&s;&s;ertions &s;he would appeal to his own ob&s;erva|tion,
and the opinion of the phy&s;ician, who was
then employ'd in writing a pre&s;cription for the
cure of her di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he conducted him into the cham|ber,
where he beheld the haple&s;s virgin &s;tretched
upon a &s;ick bed, panting under the violence of a
di&s;temper too mighty for her weakly frame, her
hair di&s;hevelled, and di&s;compo&s;ure in her looks;
all the ro&s;es of her youth were faded, yet all the
graces of her beauty were not fled: &s;he retained
that &s;weetne&s;s and &s;ymmetry, which death it&s;elf
could not de&s;troy; and though her di&s;cour&s;e was
incoherent, her voice was &s;till mu&s;ical, re&s;embling
tho&s;e feathered &s;ong&s;ters who <HI>warble their native
wood-notes wild.</HI></P>
<P>Fathom, as upon all other occa&s;ions, &s;o on
this, did behave like an inimitable actor; he ran
to the bed-&s;ide, with all the trepidation of a di|&s;tracted
lover; he fell upon his knees, and while
the tears rolled down his cheeks, imprinted a thou|&s;and
ki&s;&s;es on the &s;oft hand of Monimia, who re|garding
him with a lack lu&s;tre, and undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing
eye, &startq;Alas! Renaldo, (&s;aid &s;he) we were
born to be unhappy.&endq; &startq;Would to heaven!
(cried Ferdinand, in a tran&s;port of grief) the
wretch Renaldo had never been born! that is the
villain who &s;educed the affection of this unfortu|nate
woman. I admitted the traitor into my
friend&s;hip and confidence, relieved him in his
<PB N="117" REF="118">
nece&s;&s;ities; and, like the ungrateful viper, he
hath &s;tung the very bo&s;om that cheri&s;hed him in
his di&s;tre&s;s. Then he proceeded to inform Ma|dam
Clement, how he had delivered that &s;ame
Renaldo from pri&s;on, maintained him afterwards
at a great expence, and, at length, furni&s;hed him
with a &s;um of money, and proper credentials to
&s;upport his intere&s;t at the court of Vienna.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this detail, he a&s;ked the phy&s;i|cian's
&s;entiments of his wife's di&s;temper, and be|ing
told, that her life was in extreme jeopardy,
begged he would u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours in her
behalf, and even made him a tender of an extra|ordinary
fee; which was refu&s;ed: he al&s;o thanked
Madam Clement for her charity and benevolence
towards a &s;tranger, and took his leave, with many
polite profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude and e&s;teem. He
had no &s;ooner quitted the hou&s;e, than the phy&s;i|cian,
who was a humane man, and a foreigner,
began to caution the lady again&s;t his in&s;inuations,
ob&s;erving, that &s;ome circum&s;tances of the &s;tory
concerning Renaldo, were, to his particular know|ledge,
contrary to truth: for that he him&s;elf had
been applied to, for letters of recommendation,
in behalf of count Melvil, by a Jew merchant
of his acquaintance, who had &s;upplied the young
gentleman with money &s;ufficient for his occa&s;ions,
in con&s;equence of a minute inquiry he had made
into the character of Renaldo, who was, by all
reports, a youth of &s;trict honour, and untainted
morals.</P>
<P>Madam Clement, thus cautioned, entered into
deliberation with her own thoughts, and com|paring
the particulars of this account with tho&s;e
of Monimia's own &s;tory, &s;he concluded, that Fa|thom
was the very traitor he him&s;elf had de&s;cribed;
<PB N="118" REF="119">
and that he had, by abu&s;ing the confidence of
both, effected a fatal breach between two inno|cent
and de&s;erving lovers. She accordingly looked
upon him with horror and dete&s;tation; but, ne|verthele&s;s
re&s;olved to treat him with civility in the
mean time, that the poor young lady might not
be di&s;turbed in her la&s;t moments; for &s;he had
now lo&s;t all hopes of her recovery. Yet the &s;e|ver
abated, and in two days &s;he retrieved the
u&s;e of her rea&s;on: though the di&s;temper had af|fected
her lungs, and &s;he was in all appearance
doomed to linger a few weeks longer in a con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>Fathom was punctual in his vi&s;itation, though
never admitted into her pre&s;ence after the deli|rium
vani&s;hed; and he had the opportunity of
&s;eeing her conveyed in a chariot to Ken&s;ington
Gravel-pits, a place which may be termed the
la&s;t &s;tage of many a mortal peregrination. He
now implicitely believed, that death would in a
few days baffle all his de&s;igns upon the unfortu|nate
Monimia; and fore&s;eeing, that, as he had
owned him&s;elf her hu&s;band, he might be obliged
to defray the expence incurred by her &s;ickne&s;s and
burial, he very prudently intermitted in his vi&s;its,
and had recour&s;e to the intelligence of his auxi|liary.</P>
<P>As for Monimia, &s;he approached the goal of
life; not &s;imply with re&s;ignation, but with rap|ture:
&s;he enjoyed, in tranquillity, the conver&s;a|tion
of her kind benefactre&s;s, who never &s;tirred
from her apartment; &s;he was ble&s;&s;ed with the
&s;piritual con&s;olation of a worthy clergyman, who
removed all her religious &s;cruples; and &s;he con|gratulated
her&s;elf on the near pro&s;pect of that
land of peace where &s;orrow is not known.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
At length Mrs. la Mer gave notice to our ad|venturer
of this amiable young lady's decea&s;e, and
the time fixed for the interment: upon which
the&s;e two virtuous a&s;&s;ociates took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
place, from whence they could, unperceived, be|hold
the funeral. He mu&s;t have a hard heart,
who, without an emotion of pity, can &s;ee the
la&s;t offices performed to a young creature cut off
in the flower of youth and beauty, even tho' he
knows not her name, and is an utter &s;tranger to
her virtues.&mdash;How callous then mu&s;t the &s;oul of
that wretch have been, who, without a &s;ymptom
of remor&s;e or concern, &s;aw the &s;able hear&s;e
adorned with white plumes, as emblems of Mo|nimia's
purity, pa&s;s before him, while her incom|parable
merit &s;tood full in his remembrance, and
he knew him&s;elf the wicked cau&s;e of her untimely
fate!</P>
<P>Perfidious wretch! thy crimes turn out &s;o at|trocious,
that I half repent me of having under|taken
to record thy memoirs: yet &s;uch mon&s;ters
ought to be exhibited to public view, that man|kind
may be upon their guard again&s;t impo&s;ture;
that the world may &s;ee how fraud is apt to over|&s;hoot
it&s;elf: and that, as virtue, though it may
&s;uffer for a while, will triumph in the end; &s;o
iniquity, though it may pro&s;per for a &s;ea&s;on, will
at la&s;t be overtaken by that puni&s;hment and di&s;|grace

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fathom &s;hifts the &s;cene, and appears in a new
character.</HEAD>
<P>FATHOM's expectations, with re&s;pect to the
fair orphan, having thus proved abortive, he
lo&s;t no time in bewailing his mi&s;carriage, but had
immediate recour&s;e to other means of improving
his &s;mall fortune, which, at this period, amounted
to near two hundred pounds. Whatever incli|nation
he had to re&s;ume the character he had
formerly bore in the polite world, he dur&s;t not
venture to launch out again into the expence ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to maintain that &s;tation, becau&s;e his for|mer
re&s;ources were now &s;topt, and all the people
of fa&s;hion, by this time, convinced of his being
a needy adventurer. Neverthele&s;s, he re&s;olved
to &s;ound the &s;entiments of his old friends at a
di&s;tance, and judge, from the reception he &s;hould
meet with, how far he might pre&s;ume upon their
countenance and favour: for he rightly &s;uppo&s;ed,
that, if he could in any &s;hape contribute to their
intere&s;t or amu&s;ement, they would ea&s;ily forgive
his former preten&s;ions to quality, arrogant as they
were, and &s;till entertain him on the footing of a
nece&s;&s;ary acquaintance.</P>
<P>With this view, he one day pre&s;ented him&s;elf
at court in a very gay &s;uit of cloaths, and bow|ed,
at a di&s;tance, to many of his old fa&s;hionable
friends of both &s;exes, not one of whom favoured
him with any other notice, than that of a quar|ter
curt'&s;y, or &s;light inclination of the head: for,
by this time, the few that remembered him knew
from what retirement he now emerged, and
<PB N="121" REF="122">
avoided him accordingly as the jail infection: but
the greater part of tho&s;e who had cultivated him
in the zenith of his fortune, were now utter
&s;trangers to his per&s;on, which they had actually
forgot, amid&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of novelties that
&s;urrounded them; or, if they did recollect his
name, it was remembered as an old fa&s;hion
which had been many months out of date.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e mortifying di&s;courage|ments,
our hero, that &s;ame evening, effected a
lodgement in a certain gaming-hou&s;e not far
from St. James's; and, as he played pretty high,
and made a parade of his ready money, he was &s;oon
recognized by divers per&s;ons of con&s;equence, who
cordially welcomed him to England, on pretence
of believing he had been abroad, and with great
complacency, repeated their former profe&s;&s;ions of
friend&s;hip. Though this was a certain way of
retaining the favour of tho&s;e worthies, while his
finances continued to flouri&s;h, and his payments
were prompt, he knew the weakne&s;s of his funds
too well, to think they could bear the vici&s;&s;itudes
of play; and the remembrance of the two Bri|ti&s;h
Knights who had &s;poiled him at Paris, hung
over his imagination with the mo&s;t frightful pre|&s;ages:
be&s;ides, he perceived that gaming was
now managed in &s;uch a manner, as rendered &s;kill
and dexterity of no advantage: for the &s;pirit of
play having over&s;pread the land, like a pe&s;tilence,
raged to &s;uch a degree of madne&s;s and de&s;pera|tion,
that the unhappy people who were in|fected,
laid a&s;ide all thoughts of amu&s;ement,
oeconomy or caution, and ri&s;qued their fortunes
upon i&s;&s;ues equally extravagant, childi&s;h, and
ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">
The whole my&s;tery of the art was reduced to
the &s;imple exerci&s;e of to&s;&s;ing up a guinea, and
the lu&s;t of laying wagers, which they indulged
to a &s;urpri&s;ing pitch of ridiculous intemperance.
In one corner of the room might be heard a pair
of lordlings running their grandmothers again&s;t
each other, that is, betting &s;ums on the longe&s;t
liver; in another, the &s;ucce&s;s of the wager de|pended
upon the &s;ex of the landlady's next child;
and one of the waiters happening to drop down
in an apoplectic fit, a certain noble peer exclaim|ed,
&startq;Dead for a thou&s;and pounds.&endq; The chal|lenge
was immediately accepted; and when the
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;ent for a &s;urgeon to attempt
the cure, the nobleman who &s;et the price upon
the patient's head, in&s;i&s;ted upon his being left to
the efforts of nature alone, otherwi&s;e the wager
&s;hould be void: nay, when the landlord harped
upon the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by the death of
a tru&s;ty &s;ervant, his lord&s;hip obviated the objecti|on,
by de&s;iring that the fellow might be charged
in the bill.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the rage of gaming &s;eemed to have
devoured all their other faculties, and to have
equalled the ra&s;h enthu&s;ia&s;m of the inhabitants

with that pernicious &s;pirit, that they &s;acrifice
to it not only their fortunes, but al&s;o their wives
and children; and then letting their hair down
upon their &s;houlders, in imitation of the ancient
Lacedemonians when they devoted them&s;elves to
death, tho&s;e wretches un&s;heath their daggers and
murder every living creature in their way. In
this, however, they differ from the game&s;ters of
our country, who never find their &s;en&s;es, until

they have lo&s;t their fortune, and beggared their
families; whereas, the the Malay&s;e never <HI>run

<P>Such are the amu&s;ements, or rather, &s;uch is
the continual employment of tho&s;e hopeful youths
who are de&s;tined by birth to be the judges of our
property, and pillars of our con&s;titution: &s;uch

who planned, and tho&s;e heroes who maintained
the laws and freedom of their country; who
were the patrons of merit, the fathers of the
poor, the terror of vice and immorality, and, at
once, the ornaments and &s;upport of an happy
nation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer con&s;idered all the&s;e circum|&s;tances

he rank him&s;elf with &s;uch &s;ociety, he wi&s;ely came
to the re&s;olution of de&s;cending one &s;tep in the de|grees
of life, and of taking upon him the title of
phy&s;ician, under which he did not de&s;pair of in|&s;inuating
him&s;elf into the pockets of his patients,
and into the &s;ecrets of private families, &s;o as to
acquire a comfortable &s;hare of practice, or capti|vate
the heart of &s;ome heire&s;s or rich widow,
who&s;e fortune would, at once, render him inde|pendent
and happy.</P>
<P>After this determination, his next care was, to
concert mea&s;ures for his fir&s;t appearance in this
new character; well knowing, that the &s;ucce&s;s
of a phy&s;ician, in a great mea&s;ure, depends up|on
the external equipage in which he fir&s;t de|clares
him&s;elf an adept in the healing art. He
fir&s;t of all procured a few books on the &s;ubject
of medicine, which he &s;tudied with great atten|tion,
<PB N="124" REF="125">
during the remaining part of the winter and
&s;pring, and repaired to Tunbridge with the fir&s;t
of the &s;ea&s;on, where he appeared in the uniform
of Ae&s;culapius, namely, a plain &s;uit full trimm'd,
with a voluminous tye perriwig; believing that,
in this place, he might glide, as it were, imper|ceptibly,
into the functions of his new employ|ment,
and gradually accu&s;tom him&s;elf to the me|thod
and form of pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>A man &s;o well known in the gay world could
not be &s;uppo&s;ed to effect &s;uch a transformation,
without being ob&s;erved; and therefore, in order
to anticipate the cen&s;ure and ridicule of tho&s;e
who might be tempted to make them&s;elves merry
at his expence, he, on his arrival at the wells, re|paired
to the &s;hop of an apothecary, and, calling
for pen, ink and paper, wrote a pre&s;cription,
which he de&s;ired might be immediately made up.
While this was doing by the &s;ervant, he was in|vited
into a parlour by the ma&s;ter, with whom
he entered into conver&s;ation, touching the pro|perties
of the Tunbridge-water, which &s;eemed
to have been his particular &s;tudy: and indeed he
had peru&s;ed Rouzee's treati&s;e on that &s;ubject,
with indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity. From this theme,
he made digre&s;&s;ions into other parts of medicine,
upon which he &s;poke with &s;uch plau&s;ible elocution,
that the apothecary, who&s;e knowledge in that art
was not very profound, looked upon him as a
phy&s;ician of great learning and experience, and
hinted a de&s;ire of knowing his name and &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>Fathom accordingly gave him to under&s;tand,
that he had &s;tudied phy&s;ic, and had taken his de|grees
at Padua, rather for his amu&s;ement, than
with any view of exerci&s;ing medicine, as he then
<PB N="125" REF="126">
could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee the misfortunes which
had &s;ince happened to his family, and by which
he was now compelled to have recour&s;e to a pro|fe&s;&s;ion
that was very much beneath the expec|tations
of his birth. Yet he bore his di&s;appoint|ments
with re&s;ignation, and even good humour,
and ble&s;&s;ed his &s;tars for having inclined him to
the &s;tudy of any branch of knowledge by which
he might be enabled to laugh at the vici&s;&s;itudes
of fortune. He then ob&s;erved, that he had prac|ti&s;ed
with &s;ome applau&s;e at the hot-well, near
Bri&s;tol, before he thought he &s;hould be ever re|duced
to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a fee; and that,
in all probability, his metamorpho&s;is, when known,
would furni&s;h matter of &s;urpri&s;e and merriment
to &s;ome of his old acquaintance.</P>
<P>The apothecary was equally &s;truck with his
polite addre&s;s, and plea&s;ed with his agreeable di&s;|cour&s;e:
he con&s;oled him for the misfortunes of
his family, by a&s;&s;uring him, that, in England,
nothing could be more honourable, or indeed pro|fitable,
than the character of a phy&s;ician, pro|vided
he could once wriggle him&s;elf into prac|tice;
and in&s;inuated, that, although he was re|&s;tricted
by certain engagements with other per|&s;ons
of the faculty, he &s;hould be glad of an op|portunity
to &s;hew his regard for doctor Fathom.
This was a very effectual method which our hero
took to intimate his new character to the the public.
By the indu&s;try and communicative di&s;po&s;ition of
the apothecary, it was criculated in half a day thro'
every family in the place; and next morning,
when Ferdinand appeared, the company forth|with
a&s;&s;embled in &s;eparate groups, and from
each knot he heard his name reverberated in a
whi&s;per.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">
Having thus announced him&s;elf to all whom
it might concern, and allowed the ladies two days
to di&s;cu&s;s the merit of his transfiguration, toge|ther
with the novelty of the ca&s;e, he ventured to
&s;alute, at a di&s;tance, a lady and her daughter,
who had been his patients at the hot-well; and
although they honoured his bow with the return
of a &s;light curt&s;y, they gave him not the lea&s;t en|couragement
to make a nearer approach. Not|with&s;tanding
this rebuff, he concluded, that,
&s;hould the health of either come in que&s;tion,
they would renew their application to his &s;kill,
and what was refu&s;ed by their pride, would be
granted by their apprehen&s;ion. Here, however,
he happened to be mi&s;taken in his conjecture.</P>
<P>The young lady being &s;eized with a violent
head-ach and palpitation, her mother de&s;ired the
apothecary to recommend a phy&s;ician; and the
per&s;on, with whom he was contracted, being at
that time ab&s;ent, he propo&s;ed doctor Fathom as
a man of great ability and di&s;cretion: but the
good lady rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, be|cau&s;e
&s;he had formerly known him in the charac|ter
of a Count; though that very character was
the chief rea&s;on that had then induced her to crave
his advice.</P>
<P>Such is the caprice of the world in general,
that whatever bears the face of novelty captivates,
or rather bewitches the imagination, and con|founds
the ideas of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.
If, for example, a &s;cullion from the clinking of
pewter &s;hould conceive a ta&s;te for the clinking
of rhime, and make &s;hift to bring together twenty
&s;yllables, &s;o as that the tenth and la&s;t &s;hall have
the like ending; the compo&s;ition is immediately
extolled as a miracle; and what appeals to the
<PB N="127" REF="128">
admiration, is not the wit, the elegance or
poetry of the work, but the uncultivated talen$,
and humble &s;tation of the author. A reader does
not exclaim, &startq;What a delicate &s;entiment! what
a beautiful &s;imile! what ea&s;y and mu&s;ical ver&s;ifi|cation!&endq;
but cries in rapture, &startq;Heavens! what
a prodigy! a poet from the &s;cullery! a mu&s;e in
livery! or, Apollo with a trowel!&endq;&mdash;The public
is a&s;toni&s;hed into liberality&mdash;the &s;cullion eats from
tho&s;e trenchers he &s;coured before&mdash;the footman is
admitted into the coach, behind which he was
wont to &s;tand; and the bricklayer, in&s;tead of
plai&s;tering walls, bedaubs his <HI>illu&s;trious part'ner</HI>
with the mortar of his prai&s;e. Thus, lifted into
an higher &s;phere, their talents receive cultivation;
they become profe&s;&s;ed bards; and tho' their &s;ub|&s;equent
works bear evident marks of improve|ment,
they are neglected among the re&s;t of their
brethren; becau&s;e that novelty, which recom|mended
them in the beginning, no longer re|mains.</P>
<P>So it fared with our adventurer in his new oc|cupation.
There was &s;omething &s;o extraordinary
in a nobleman's under&s;tanding medicine; and &s;o
uncommon in a phy&s;ician's pre&s;cribing gratis,
that the curio&s;ity and admiration of the company
at Bri&s;tol were engaged, and they followed his
advice, as the direction of &s;ome &s;upernatural in|telligence:
but, now that he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf one
of the faculty, and might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have re|fre&s;hed
his memory, and reinforced his know|ledge
for the occa&s;ion, he was as much over|looked
as any other phy&s;ician un&s;upported by in|tere&s;t
or cabal; or, at lea&s;t, the notice he at|tracted
was not at all to the advantage of his
character, becau&s;e it wholly regarded the decline
<PB N="128" REF="129">
of his fortune, which is a never-failing fund of
di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The&s;e mortifications did not overcome the
patience and per&s;everance of Fathom, who fore|&s;aw
that the &s;oothing hand of time would ca&s;t a
veil of oblivion over tho&s;e &s;cenes which were re|membered
to his prejudice; and that in the
mean time, though he was excluded from the
private parties of the fair &s;ex, in which his main
hope of &s;ucce&s;s was placed, he &s;hould be able to
in&s;inuate him&s;elf into &s;ome degree of favour and
practice among the male patients; and &s;ome lucky
cure, properly di&s;played, might be the means of
propagating his fame, and bani&s;hing that re&s;erve
which at pre&s;ent interfered with his purpo&s;e.
Accordingly, it was not long before he found
means to break that &s;pell of univer&s;al prejudice
that hedged him in. At the ordinary which he
frequented, his polite carriage, facetious remarks,
and agreeable &s;tories, &s;oon conciliated the regard
of his fellow gue&s;ts, among whom he &s;ometimes
rallied his own transformation with &s;ingular good
humour and &s;ucce&s;s: he was even witty upon his
want of employment; and u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that
a phy&s;ician, without practice, had one comfort
to which his brethren were &s;trangers, namely,
that the &s;eldomer he had occa&s;ion to pre&s;cribe,
the le&s;s he had upon his con&s;cience on account
of being acce&s;&s;ory to the death of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;o effectually blunts the &s;hafts of ridi|cule,
and defeats the aims of &s;lander, as this me|thod
of anticipation. In &s;pite of the arrows that
were levelled again&s;t his reputation from every
tea-table at Tunbridge, he made his party good
among almo&s;t all the gay young gentlemen that
<PB N="129" REF="130">
frequented the place: far from avoiding his
company, they began to court his conver&s;ation,
and he was commonly &s;een in the walks, &s;ur|rounded
with a group of admirers.</P>
<P>Having thus paved the way for a total removal
of the invidious prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that ob&s;tructed his
views, he, one night, while every per&s;on was
lulled in the arms of repo&s;e, and univer&s;al &s;ilence
prevailed, tuned his violin, and began to play
&s;ome ma&s;terly airs, in a tone &s;o uncommonly ex|pre&s;&s;ive,
and with &s;uch ravi&s;hing dexterity of exe|cution,
that a certain lady who lodged in the
&s;ame hou&s;e, being waked by the mu&s;ic, and ig|norant
of the &s;ource from which it flowed, li&s;t|ened
with rapture, as to the harp of an angel,
and wrapping her&s;elf in a loo&s;e gown, ro&s;e and
opened her chamber-door, in order to di&s;cover
in what apartment the mu&s;ician re&s;ided. She
no &s;ooner entered the pa&s;&s;age, than &s;he found
her fellow-lodgers already a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ame
occa&s;ion; and there they remained during the
be&s;t part of the night, tran&s;ported by the harmo|ny
which our hero produced.</P>
<P>Doctor Fathom was immediately known to be
the author of this entertainment; and thus re|trieved
the benefit of that admiration which he
had forfeited by appearing in the &s;hape of a phy|&s;ician.
For, as people had formerly wondered
to &s;ee a Count &s;killed in medicine; they were
now amazed to find a phy&s;ician &s;uch a ma&s;ter in
mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The good effects of this &s;tratagem were almo&s;t
in&s;tantaneous. His performance became the to|pic
of di&s;cour&s;e among all the fa&s;hionable com|pany:
his male friends complimented him from
the information of the other &s;ex; and that lady
<PB N="130" REF="131">
whom he had regaled, in&s;tead of that &s;hyne&s;s and
di&s;dain with which &s;he u&s;ed to receive his &s;alu|tation,
at their very next meeting in the thorough|fare,
returned his bow with marks of profound
re&s;pect. Nay, at midnight, &s;he, with the re&s;t,
took po&s;t in the &s;ame place where they had been
&s;tationed before; and by frequent tittering, and
repeated whi&s;pers, gave intimation to Fathom,
that they would be glad of a &s;econd &s;erenade.
But he was too well acquainted with the human
pa&s;&s;ions to indulge this their de&s;ire: it was his
intere&s;t to inflame their impatience, rather than
to gratify their expectation: and therefore he
tantalized them for &s;ome hours, by tuning his
violin, and playing &s;ome flouri&s;hes, which,
however, produced nothing to fulfil their
wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>At the ordinary, he was acco&s;ted by a gentle|man
a lodger in the &s;ame hou&s;e, who a&s;&s;ured
him, that the ladies would take it as a great
favour, if he would let them know when he
intended to amu&s;e him&s;elf again with his in|&s;trument,
that they might not, by falling a&s;leep
before-hand, deprive them&s;elves of the plea&s;ure
of hearing his mu&s;ic. To this me&s;&s;age he re|plied
with an air of con&s;equence and re&s;erve,
that, though mu&s;ic was not the art he profe&s;&s;ed,
he &s;hould be always complai&s;ant enough to en|tertain
the ladies to the utmo&s;t of his power,
when their commands were &s;ignified to him in
a manner &s;uited to his character; but that he
would never put him&s;elf on the footing of an
itinerant harper, who&s;e mu&s;ic is tolerated thro'
the medium of a board partition. The gentleman
having reported this an&s;wer to his con&s;tituents,
they empowered him to invite doctor Fathom to
<PB N="131" REF="132">
breakfa&s;t, and he was next morning introduced
with the u&s;ual ceremony, and treated with un|common
regard by all the females of the hou&s;e,
a&s;&s;embled for his reception.</P>
<P>Having thus broke the ice of their aver&s;ion, in
one part, &s;o as that the beams of his per&s;onal
accompli&s;hment had room to operate, he &s;oon
effected a general thaw in his favour, and found
him&s;elf growing once more into reque&s;t among
the mo&s;t amiable part of the creation. His com|pany
was coveted, and his ta&s;te con&s;ulted in their
balls, concerts, and private a&s;&s;emblies; and he
recompenced the regard they paid to him, with
an ince&s;&s;ant exertion of his agreeable talents,
politene&s;s and good humour.</P>

<P>YET, in the mid&s;t of all this attention, his
medical capacity &s;eemed to be quite forgot.
They re&s;pected his good breeding; were charmed
with his voice, and admired the fine touches of
his hand upon the violin; but, in cultivating the
fidler, they utterly neglected the phy&s;ician; and
in vain did he attempt to divide their regard, by
taking all opportunities to turn the conver&s;ation
into a more intere&s;ting channel. It was to little
purpo&s;e he endeavoured to arrou&s;e the wonder of
his audience with frequent de&s;criptions of porten|tuous
maladies and amazing cures he had &s;een
and performed in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudy and prac|tice
abroad: and to no effect did he publickly
bu&s;y him&s;elf in making experiments on the mine|ral
water, in which he pretended to have made
<PB N="132" REF="133">
&s;everal new and important di&s;coveries. The&s;e
efforts did not make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon the
minds of the company; becau&s;e they &s;aw nothing
&s;urprizing in a phy&s;ician's being acquainted with
all the my&s;teries of his art; and, as their cu&s;tom
was already be&s;poke for others of the profe&s;&s;ion,
whom it was their intere&s;t to employ, our adven|turer
might have &s;tarved amid&s;t the care&s;&s;es of his
acquaintance, had not he derived con&s;iderable
advantage from a lucky accident in the cour&s;e of
his expectancy.</P>
<P>A gentlewoman's daughter, of a weakly con|&s;titution,
by drinking the waters, had &s;o far re|covered
her health and complexion, as to allure
the affection of a young &s;quire in the neighbour|hood,
who amu&s;ed her for &s;ome time with his
addre&s;&s;es, until his heart was &s;educed by the
charms of another young lady lately arrived at the
wells. The for&s;aken nymph, &s;hocked at this di&s;|grace
and mortification, relap&s;ed into her former
langui&s;hing di&s;order, and was by her mother put
under the management and pre&s;cription of a phy|&s;ician,
who had been an indu&s;trious enemy of Fa|thom,
from his fir&s;t appearance at Tunbridge.
The patient, tho' violently chagrined at the levi|ty
of her quondam admirer, was not altogether
without hope, that the very &s;ame incon&s;tancy
which had prompted him to leave her, might in
time induce him to return, after the novelty of
his new pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be wore off; and this
hope &s;erved to &s;upport her under the &s;orrow and
di&s;grace of her di&s;appointment. At length, how|ever,
the &s;quire and his new mi&s;tre&s;s di&s;appear|ed,
and &s;ome bu&s;y body was officious enough to
communicate this piece of news to the forlorn
&s;hepherde&s;s, with this additional circum&s;tance, that
<PB N="133" REF="134">
they were gone to a neighbouring pari&s;h, to be
joined in the bands of wedlock.</P>
<P>The&s;e fatal tidings were no &s;ooner imparted to
the abandoned Phillis, than &s;he was &s;eized with
an hy&s;teric fit; and, what rendered the accident
more unfortunate, her phy&s;ician had been called
to the country, and was not expected at Tun|bridge
'till next day. The apothecary was im|mediately
&s;ummoned; and, being either puzzled
by the &s;ymptoms, or afraid of encroaching upon
the province of his &s;uperiors, advi&s;ed the old lady
to &s;end for doctor Fathom without delay. She
had no other objection to this expedient, but the
enmity which &s;he knew &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two
leeches: yet hearing that her own doctor would
not con&s;ult with Fathom upon his return, but,
perhaps, renounce the patient, by which means
her daughter's health might be endangered, &s;he
would not &s;ollicit our hero's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, until the
young lady had remained &s;even hours &s;peechle&s;s
and in&s;en&s;ible; when her fear prevailing over
every other con&s;ideration, &s;he implored the ad|vice
of our adventurer, who having made the
nece&s;&s;ary interrogations, and felt the patient's
pul&s;e, which was regular and di&s;tinct, found
rea&s;on to conclude, that the fit would not la&s;t
much longer; and, after having ob&s;erved, that
&s;he was in a very dangerous way, pre&s;cribed
&s;ome medicines for external application; and,
to enhance their opinion of his diligence and
humanity, re&s;olved to &s;tay in the room, and ob|&s;erve
their effect.</P>
<P>His judgment did not fail him on this occa&s;i|on.
In le&s;s than half an hour after his embro|cations
had been applied, &s;he recovered the u&s;e of
her tongue, opened her eyes, and having in deli|rious
<PB N="134" REF="135">
exclamations, upbraided her perfidious lo|ver,
became quite &s;en&s;ible and compo&s;ed; though
&s;he continued extremely low and dejected: to re|medy
the&s;e &s;inkings, certain cordials were imme|diately
admini&s;tered, according to the pre&s;cription
of doctor Fathom, upon whom extraordinary en|comiums
were be&s;towed by all pre&s;ent, who be|lieved
he had actually re&s;cued her from the jaws
of death; and as he was, by this time, let into
the &s;ecrets of the family, he found him&s;elf in a
fair way of being an egregious favourite of the
old gentlewoman; when, unluckly, his brother
having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his country patient with uncom|mon
di&s;patch, entered the apartment, and eyed
his rival with looks of inexpre&s;&s;ible rage; then
&s;urveying the patient, and the vials that &s;tood
upon the table, by turns, &startq;What, in the name
of God! (cried he) is the meaning of all this
tra&s;h?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Really, doctor, (replied the mother, a little
counfounded at being thus taken by &s;urprize)
Biddy has been taken dangerou&s;ly ill, and lain
&s;even or eight hours in a &s;evere fit, from which,
I am confident, &s;he would never have recovered,
without the help of a phy&s;ician; and as you were
ab&s;ent, we had recour&s;e to this gentleman, who&s;e
pre&s;cription hath had an happy and &s;urpri&s;ing ef|fect.&endq;
&startq;Effect! (cried this offended member
of the faculty) p&s;haw! &s;tuff, who made you judge
of effects or cau&s;es? (then advancing to the pa|tient)
what has been the matter, mi&s;s Biddy, that
you could not wait till my return?&endq;</P>
<P>Here Fathom interpo&s;ing, &startq;Sir, (&s;aid he) if
you will &s;tep into the next room, I will commu|nicate
my &s;entiments of the ca&s;e, together with
the method upon which I have proceeded, that
<PB N="135" REF="136">
we may deliberate upon the next &s;tep that is to be
taken.&endq; In&s;tead of complying with this propo&s;al,
he &s;eated him&s;elf in a chair, with his back to our
adventurer, and while he examined mi&s;s Biddy's
pul&s;e, gave him to under&s;tand, that he &s;hould not
con&s;ult with him about the matter.</P>
<P>Fathom, not in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted at this
uncivil an&s;wer, walked round his antagoni&s;t, and
placing him&s;elf in his front, de&s;ired to know his
rea&s;on for treating him with &s;uch &s;upercilious con|tempt.
&startq;I am re&s;olved (&s;aid the other) never
to con&s;ult with any phy&s;ician who has not taken
his degrees at either of the Engli&s;h univer&s;ities.&endq;
&startq;Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition (replied our adventurer)
that no per&s;on can be properly educated for the
profe&s;&s;ion at any other &s;chool.&endq; &startq;You are in
the right: (an&s;wered doctor Looby) that is one
of many rea&s;ons I have to decline the con&s;ulta|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How far you are in the right, (retorted Fa|thom)
I leave the world to judge, after I have
ob&s;erved, that in your Engli&s;h univer&s;ities, there
is no opportunity of &s;tudying the art; no, not &s;o
much as a lecture given on the &s;ubject: nor is
there one phy&s;ician of note, in this kingdom,
who has not derived the greate&s;t part of his me|dical
knowledge, from the in&s;tructions of fo|reigners.&endq;</P>
<P>Looby, incen&s;ed at this a&s;&s;everation, which he
was not prepared to refute, exclaimed in a mo&s;t
infuriate accent, &startq;Who are you? whence came
you? where was you bred? you are one of tho&s;e,
I believe, who graduate them&s;elves, and com|mence
doctors, the Lord knows how: an inter|loper,
who, without licen&s;e or authority, come
hither to take the bread out of the mouths of gen|tlemen,
<PB N="136" REF="137">
who have been trained to the bu&s;ine&s;s in
a regular manner, and be&s;towed great pains and
expence to qualify them&s;elves for the profe&s;&s;ion:
for my own part, my education co&s;t me fifteen
hundred pounds.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never was money laid out to le&s;s purpo&s;e:
(&s;aid Ferdinand) for it does not appear, that you
have learned &s;o much as the ba&s;is of medical ac|quirements,
namely, that decorum and urbanity
which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h the deportment of eve|ry
phy&s;ician: you have even deba&s;ed the noble&s;t
and mo&s;t beneficial art that ever engaged the &s;tu|dy
of mankind, which cannot be too much culti|vated,
and too little re&s;trained, in &s;eeking to li|mit
the practice of it, to a &s;et of narrow-minded
illiberal wretches, who, like the lowe&s;t handi|craft&s;men,
claim the exclu&s;ive privileges of a cor|poration:
had you doubted my ability, you ought
to have &s;atisfied your&s;elf in a manner con&s;i&s;tent
with decency and candour: but your behaviour,
on this occa&s;ion, is &s;uch a malicious outrage upon
good manners and humanity, that, were it not
for my regard to the&s;e ladies, I would cha&s;ti&s;e
you for your in&s;olence, on the &s;pot. Mean while,
madam, (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the mother) you
mu&s;t give me leave to in&s;i&s;t upon your di&s;mi&s;&s;ing
either that gentleman, or me, without he&s;ita|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>This peremptory language had an in&s;tantaneous
effect upon the hearers. Looby's face grew pale,
and his nether lip began to tremble: the patient
was di&s;mayed, and the old gentlewoman con|cerned
and perplexed: &s;he earne&s;tly be&s;ought the
gentlemen to be-reconciled to each other, and
enter into a friendly con&s;ultation upon her daugh|ter's
di&s;temper: but, finding both equally aver&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="138">
to accommodation, and Fathom becoming more
and more importunate in his demand, &s;he pre|&s;ented
him with a double fee; and giving him to
under&s;tand, that doctor Looby had long attended
the family, and was intimately acquainted with
her own and Biddy's con&s;titution, &s;aid, &s;he hoped
he would not take it ami&s;s, if &s;he retained her
old phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Though our hero was much mortified at this
triumph of his rival, he made a virtue of nece&s;&s;i|ty,
and retired with great complai&s;ance, wi&s;hing,
that Mi&s;s Biddy might never again be the &s;ubject
of &s;uch a di&s;agreeable di&s;pute. Whether the pa|tient
was frighted at this altercation, or di&s;plea&s;ed
with her mother's deci&s;ion again&s;t an agreeable
young fellow, who had, as it were, recalled her
from the grave, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the
&s;ecret that rankled at her heart; or the di&s;ea&s;e
had wound up her nerves for another paroxy&s;m;
certain it is, &s;he, all of a &s;udden, broke forth in|to
a violent peal of laughter, which was &s;ucceed|ed
by the mo&s;t doleful cries, and other expre&s;&s;ions
of grief; then &s;he relap&s;ed into a fit, attended
with &s;trong convul&s;ions, to the un&s;peakable terror
of the old gentlewoman, who intreated doctor
Looby to be expeditious in his pre&s;cription: ac|cordingly,
he &s;eized the pen with great confi|dence,
and a whole magazine of anti-hy&s;teric
medicines were, in different forms, externally
and internally applied.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, either nature was di&s;turbed, in
her own efforts, by the&s;e applications, or the
patient was re&s;olved to di&s;grace the doctor:
for the more remedies that were admini&s;tered,
her convul&s;ions became the more violent; and in
&s;pite of all his endeavours, he could not over|come
<PB N="138" REF="139">
the ob&s;tinacy of the di&s;temper. Such a
mi&s;carriage upon the back of his rival's &s;ucce&s;s,
could not fail to overwhelm him with confu&s;ion;
e&s;pecially as the mother baited him with repeated
intreaties, to do &s;omething for the recovery of her
daughter: at length, after having exerci&s;ed her
patience in vain, for &s;everal hours, this affectio|nate
parent could no longer &s;uppre&s;s the &s;ug|ge&s;tions
of her concern, but, in an incoherent
&s;train, told him, that her duty would not &s;uffer
her to be longer &s;ilent in an affair on which de|pended
the life of her dear child: that &s;he had
&s;een enough, to believe he had mi&s;taken the ca&s;e
of poor Biddy, and he could not ju&s;tly blame her
for recalling doctor Fathom, who&s;e pre&s;cription
had operated in a miraculous manner.</P>
<P>Looby, &s;hocked at this propo&s;al, prote&s;ted
again&s;t it with great vehemence, as an expedient
highly injurious to him&s;elf. &startq;My remedies
(&s;aid he) are ju&s;t beginning to take effect, and,
in all probability, the fit will not la&s;t much longer;
&s;o that by calling in another per&s;on, at this junc|ture,
you will defraud me of that credit which is
my due, and deck my adver&s;ary with trophies, to
which he has no preten&s;ion.&endq; She was prevailed
upon, by this remon&s;trance, to wait another half
hour, when perceiving, as yet, no alteration for
the better, and being di&s;tracted with her fears,
which reproached her with want of natural affec|tion,
&s;he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to doctor Fathom, de|&s;iring
to &s;ee him with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>He was not &s;low in obeying the call, but ha|&s;tening
to the &s;cene of action, was not a little
&s;urpri&s;ed to find Looby &s;till in the apartment.
This gentleman, &s;ince better might not be, re|&s;olved
to &s;acrifice his pride to his intere&s;t, and,
<PB N="139" REF="140">
rather than lo&s;e his patient altogether, and run
the ri&s;que of forfeiting his reputation at the &s;ame
time, &s;taid with intention to compromi&s;e his dif|ference
with Fathom, that he might not be whol|ly
excluded from the honour of the cure, in ca&s;e
it could be effected: but he had reckoned with|out
his ho&s;t, in his calculation of the count's pla|cability;
for when he put on his capitulating
face, and after a &s;light apology for his late beha|viour,
propo&s;ed that all animo&s;ity &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide
in favour of the young lady, who&s;e life was at
&s;take, our hero rejected his advances with infinite
di&s;dain, and a&s;&s;ured the mother, in a very &s;olemn
tone, that, far from con&s;ulting with a man who
had treated him &s;o unworthily, he would not &s;tay
another minute in the hou&s;e, unle&s;s he &s;hould &s;ee
him di&s;carded: a &s;atisfaction barely &s;ufficient to
attone for the affront he him&s;elf had &s;uffered by
the unju&s;t preference &s;he had before given to his
rival.</P>
<P>There was no remedy: Looby was obliged to
retreat in his turn; then our adventurer approach|ing
the bed-&s;ide, reconnoitered the patient, exa|mined
the medicines which had been admini&s;tered,
and lifting up his eyes in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, de|tached
the footman with a new order to the apo|thecary.
It was well the me&s;&s;enger u&s;ed expedi|tion,
otherwi&s;e doctor Fathom would have been
anticipated by the operation of nature; for, the
fit having almo&s;t run its carreer, mi&s;s Biddy was
on the point of retrieving her &s;en&s;es, when the
frontal pre&s;cribed by Fathom was applied; to the
efficacy of this, therefore, was a&s;cribed her reco|very,
when &s;he opened her eyes, and began to
pour forth unconnected ejaculations; and in a
<PB N="140" REF="141">
few moments after, &s;he was per&s;uaded to &s;wallow
a draught prepared for the purpo&s;e, her percep|tion
returned, and Ferdinand gained the reputa|tion
of having performed a &s;econd miracle.</P>
<P>But he was furni&s;hed with a piece of intelli|gence,
of much more energy than all &s;he had ta|ken,
and &s;o &s;oon as he concluded &s;he was capable
to bear the news, without any dangerous emo|tion,
he, among other articles of chit-chat, culled
for her amu&s;ement, took the opportunity of tel|ling
the company, that '&s;quire Stub (the cau&s;e of
mi&s;s Biddy's di&s;order) had, in his way to matri|mony,
been robbed of his bride, by a gentleman
to whom &s;he had been formerly engaged. He
had waited for her, on purpo&s;e, at an inn on the
road, where he found means to appea&s;e her di&s;|plea&s;ure,
which he had, it &s;eems, incurred, and
to &s;uper&s;ede her new lover, whom &s;he quitted
without ceremony; upon which the '&s;quire had
returned to Tunbridge, cur&s;ing her levity, yet
ble&s;&s;ing his good &s;tars for having &s;o &s;ea&s;onably
prevented his ruin, which would have infallibly
been the con&s;equence of his marrying &s;uch an ad|venturer.</P>
<P>It would be fuper&s;luous to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e
tidings operated, like an admirable &s;pecifick, on
the &s;pirits of the young lady, who, while &s;he af|fected
to pity the '&s;quire, was &s;o much overjoyed
at his di&s;appointment, that her eyes began to
&s;parkle with uncommon vivacity, and in le&s;s than
two hours after the la&s;t of tho&s;e terrible attacks,
&s;he was re&s;tored to a better &s;tate of health than
&s;he had enjoyed for many weeks. Fathom was
not forgot amid&s;t the rejoicings of the family:
be&s;ides an hand&s;ome gratuity for the effects of his
extraordinary &s;kill, the old lady favoured him with
<PB N="141" REF="142">
a general invitation to her hou&s;e, and the daugh|ter
not only con&s;idered him as the re&s;torer of her
health, and angel of her good fortune, but al&s;o
began to di&s;cover an uncommon reli&s;h for his
conver&s;ation; &s;o that he was &s;truck with the pro|&s;pect
of &s;ucceeding '&s;quire Stub in her affection:
a conque&s;t, which, if &s;anctioned by the approba|tion
of the mother, would con&s;ole him for all the
di&s;appointments he had &s;u&s;tained; for Mi&s;s Biddy
was intitled to a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds,
provided &s;he &s;hould marry with the con&s;ent of
her parent, who was the &s;ole executrix of the &s;a|ther's
will.</P>
<P>Animated with the hope of &s;uch an advanta|geous
match, our adventurer mi&s;&s;ed no opportu|nity
of improving the lodgement he had made;
while the two ladies failed not to extol his medical
capacity, among all their female acquaintance.
By means of this circulation, his advice was de|manded
in &s;everal other ca&s;es, which he managed
with &s;uch an impo&s;ing air of &s;agacity and im|portance,
that his fame began to &s;pread, and be|fore
the end of the &s;ea&s;on, he had ravi&s;hed more
than one half of the bu&s;ine&s;s from his competi|tor.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e fortunate events, he
fore&s;aw, that he &s;hould find great difficulty in
tran&s;planting his reputation, &s;o as to take root in
London, which was the only &s;oil in which he
could propo&s;e to ri&s;e to any degree of pro&s;perity
and independance; and this reflection was ground|ed
upon a maxim which univer&s;ally prevails among
the Engli&s;h people, namely, to overlook and
wholly neglect, on their return to the metropolis,
all the connexions they may have chanced to ac|quire
during their re&s;idence at any of the medical
wells: and this &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly
<PB N="142" REF="143">
maintained, that two per&s;ons who lived in the
mo&s;t intimate corre&s;pondence at Bath or Tun|bridge,
&s;hall, in four and twenty hours, &s;o totally
forget their friend&s;hip, as to meet in St. James's
park, without betraying the lea&s;t token of recog|nition;
&s;o that one would imagine tho&s;e mineral
waters were &s;o many &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from the ri|ver
<HI>Lethe,</HI> &s;o famed of old, for wa&s;hing away all
traces of memory and recollection.</P>
<P>Aware of this oblivious principle, doctor Fa|thom
collected all his qualifications, in order to
make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of Mi&s;s
Biddy, as would re&s;i&s;t all her endeavours to &s;hake
him from her remembrance; and his efforts &s;uc|ceeded
&s;o well, that '&s;quire Stub's advances to a
reconciliation, were treated with manife&s;t indif|ference.
In all probability, our hero would have
made a very advantageous campaign, had not his
good fortune been retarded by an ob&s;truction,
which (as he did not perceive it) he could not
po&s;&s;ibly &s;urmount: in di&s;playing his accompli&s;h|ments
to captivate the daughter, he had unwit|tingly
made an ab&s;olute conque&s;t of the mother,
who &s;uperintended the conduct of Mi&s;s Biddy,
with &s;uch jealous vigilance, that he could find no
opportunity of profiting by the progre&s;s he had
made in her heart; for the careful matron would
never lo&s;e &s;ight of her, no, not for one mo|ment.</P>
<P>Had the old lady given the lea&s;t intimation to
our adventurer, of the &s;entiments &s;he entertained
in his behalf, his complai&s;ance was of &s;uch a plia|ble
texture, that he would have quitted his other
pur&s;uit, and made her the &s;ole object of his atten|tion:
but &s;he either depended upon the effect of
his own good ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, or was too
<PB N="143" REF="144">
Proud to di&s;clo&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion which he had hitherto
overlooked.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Repairs to the Metropolis, and enrols him&s;elf among
the &s;ons of Paean.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE this affair could be brought to a
proper explanation, the &s;ea&s;on being almo&s;t
ended, the ladies departed from Tunbridge, and
in a little time doctor Fathom followed them to
London, having previou&s;ly obtained permi&s;&s;ion to
vi&s;it them in that metropolis. He had &s;ollicited
the &s;ame favour of &s;ome other families, in which
he hoped to take root, though he knew they were
pre-engaged to different phy&s;icians; and re&s;olving
to make his fir&s;t medical appearance in London,
with &s;ome <HI>eclat,</HI> he not only purcha&s;ed an old
chariot, which was new painted for the purpo&s;e,
but likewi&s;e hired a footman, whom he cloathed
in laced livery, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf
from the common run of his brethren.</P>
<P>This equipage, though much more expen&s;ive
than his finances could bear, he found ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, to give him a chance for employment;
as every &s;habby retainer to phy&s;ic, in this capi|tal,
had provided him&s;elf with a vehicle, which
was altogether u&s;ed by way of a travelling &s;ign
po&s;t, to draw in cu&s;tomers; &s;o that a walking
phy&s;ician was con&s;idered as an ob&s;cure pedlar,
trudging from &s;treet to &s;treet, with his pack of
knowledge on his &s;houlders, and &s;elling his rem|nants
of advice by retail. A chariot was not
now &s;et up for the convenience of a man &s;inking
under the fatigue of exten&s;ive practice, but as a
<PB N="144" REF="145">
piece of furniture every way as nece&s;&s;ary as a
large periwig with three tails; and a phy&s;ician,
let his merit, in other re&s;pects, be never &s;o con|&s;picuous,
can no more expect to become con|&s;iderable
in bu&s;ine&s;s, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this
implement, than he can hope to live without food,
or breathe without a windpipe.</P>
<P>This requi&s;ite is &s;o well under&s;tood, that, ex|clu&s;ive
of tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves doctors,
every raw &s;urgeon, every idle apothecary, who
can make intere&s;t with &s;ome foolhardy coach|maker,
may be &s;een dancing the hays in all places
of public re&s;ort, and grinning to one another from
their re&s;pective carriages. Hence proceed many
of tho&s;e cruel accidents which are recorded in the
daily papers. An apothecary's hor&s;es take fright,
and run away with his chariot, which is heard of
no more: an eminent &s;urgeon being overturned,
is &s;o terrified at the thoughts of mutilation, that
he re&s;olves to walk on foot all the days of his life;
and the coachman of a phy&s;ician of great practice,
having the misfortune to be di&s;abled by a fall from
the box, his ma&s;ter can never find another to &s;up|ply
his place.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e ob&s;ervations e&s;caped the pene|trating
eye of Fathom, who, before he pretended
to &s;eat him&s;elf in his machine, had made proper
inquiry into all the other methods practi&s;ed, with
a view to keep the wheels in motion. In his re|&s;earches,
he found that the great world was whol|ly
engro&s;&s;ed by a few practitioners who had ar|rived
at the &s;ummit of reputation, con&s;equently,
were no longer obliged to cultivate tho&s;e arts
by which they ro&s;e; and that the re&s;t of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was parcelled out into &s;mall inclo&s;ures, oc|cupied
by different groupes of per&s;onages, male
<PB N="145" REF="146">
and female, who &s;tood in rings, and to&s;&s;ed the
ball from one to another, there being in each de|partment
two &s;ets, the individuals of which re|lieved
one another occa&s;ionaliy. Every knot was
compo&s;ed of a waiting-woman, nur&s;e, apothe|cary,
&s;urgeon and phy&s;ician, and, &s;ometimes, a
midwife was admitted into the partie; and in this
manner the farce was commonly performed.</P>
<P>A fine lady, fatigued with idlene&s;s, complains
of the vapours, is deprived of her re&s;t, tho' not
&s;o &s;ick as to have recour&s;e to medicine: her fa|vourite
maid, tired with giving her attendance in
the night, thinks proper, for the benefit of her
own repo&s;e, to complain of a violent head-ach,
and recommends to her mi&s;tre&s;s a nur&s;e of ap|proved
tenderne&s;s and di&s;cretion; at who&s;e hou&s;e
(in all likelihood) the &s;aid chamber-maid hath oft
given the rendezvous to a male friend. The
nur&s;e, well &s;killed in the my&s;teries of her occu|pation,
per&s;uades the patient, that her malady,
far from being &s;light or chimerical, may proceed
to a very dangerous degree of the hy&s;terical affec|tion,
unle&s;s it be nipt in the bud by &s;ome very
effectual remedy: then &s;he recounts a &s;urpri&s;ing
cure performed by a certain apothecary, and ap|peals
to the te&s;timony of the waiting woman, who
being the go&s;&s;ip of his wife, confirms the evidence,
and corroborates the propo&s;al. The apothecary
being &s;ummoned, finds her lady&s;hip in &s;uch a de|licate
&s;ituation, that he declines pre&s;cribing, and
advi&s;es her to &s;end for a phy&s;ician without delay.
The nomination, of cour&s;e, falls to him, and the
doctor being called, declares the nece&s;&s;ity of im|mediate
venae&s;ection, which is accordingly per|formed
by the &s;urgeon of the a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
This is one way of beginning the game: tho'
the commencement often varies, and &s;ometimes
the apothecary, and &s;ometimes the phy&s;ician opens
the &s;cene; but, be that as it will, they always ap|pear
in a &s;tring, like a flight of wild gee&s;e, and
each confederacy maintains a corre&s;pondence with
one particular undertaker. Fathom, upon the&s;e
con&s;iderations, &s;et up his re&s;t in the fir&s;t floor of
an apothecary in the neighbourhood of Charing|cro&s;s,
to whom he was introduced by a letter
from a friend at Tunbridge, and who being made
acquainted with his ability and &s;cheme, promi&s;ed
to let &s;lip no opportunity of &s;erving him; and,
indeed, &s;eemed to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;t with great
alacrity. He introduced him to &s;ome of his pa|tients,
on the &s;trength of a gratis vi&s;it, &s;ound|ed
forth his prai&s;e among all the good women of
his acquaintance; and even prevailed upon him
to publi&s;h adverti&s;ements, importing, that he
would, every day, at a certain time and place,
give his advice to the poor for nothing; hoping,
that, by means of &s;ome lucky cure, his fame
might be extended, and his practice grow into
reque&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his chariot rolled along thro'
all the mo&s;t frequented &s;treets, during the whole
forenoon, and, at the u&s;ual hour, he never failed
to make his appearance at the medical coffee-hou&s;e,
with all that &s;olemnity of feature and ad|dre&s;s,
by which the modern &s;ons of <HI>Paean</HI> are
di&s;tingui&s;hed; not but that he was often puzzled
about the deci&s;ion of his diurnal route: for the
method of driving up one &s;treet, and down ano|ther,
without halting, was become &s;uch a &s;tale
expedient, that the very 'prentices u&s;ed to &s;tand
at the &s;hop doors, and ridicule the vain parade.
<PB N="147" REF="148">
At length, however, he peru&s;ed the map of Lon|don
with great diligence, and having acquired a
di&s;tinct idea of its topography, u&s;ed to alight at
the end of long narrow thorough-fares, and paved
courts, where the chariot was ordered to wait till
his return; and walking with great gravity thro'
the different turnings of the&s;e alleys, regain his
carriage by another pa&s;&s;age, and re&s;ume his &s;eat
with an air of va&s;t importance. With a view to
protract the time of his &s;uppo&s;ed vi&s;its, he would,
at one place, turn a&s;ide to the wall; at another,
cheapen an urinal; at a third corner, read a
quack adverti&s;ement, or lounge a few minutes in
&s;ome book&s;eller's &s;hop; and, la&s;tly, glide into
&s;ome ob&s;cure coffeehou&s;e, and treat him&s;elf with
a dram of u&s;quebaugh.</P>
<P>The other means u&s;ed to force a trade, &s;uch as
ordering him&s;elf to be called from church, alarm|ing
the neighbourhood with knocking at his door
in the night, receiving &s;udden me&s;&s;ages in places
of re&s;ort, and in&s;erting his cures by way of news
in the daily papers, had been &s;o injudiciou&s;ly
hackneyed by every de&s;perate &s;culler in phy&s;ick,
that they had lo&s;t their effect upon the publick,
and therefore were excluded from the plan of our
adventurer, who&s;e &s;cheme, for the pre&s;ent, was
to exert him&s;elf in winning the favour of tho&s;e
&s;age Sybils, who keep, as it were, the temple of
medicine, and admit the young prie&s;t to the &s;er|vice
of the altar; but this he con&s;idered as a tem|porary
project only, until he &s;hould have acquired
intere&s;t enough to erect an ho&s;pital, lock, or in|firmary,
by the voluntary &s;ub&s;cription of his
friends; a &s;cheme which had &s;ucceeded to a mi|racle,
with many of the profe&s;&s;ion, who had rai&s;ed
<PB N="148" REF="149">
them&s;elves into notice, upon the carca&s;es of the
poor.</P>
<P>Yet, even this branch was already over-&s;tock|ed,
in&s;omuch that almo&s;t every &s;treet was fur|ni&s;hed
with one of the&s;e charitable receptacles,
which, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing the taxes for the
maintenance of the poor, encouraged the vulgar
to be idle and di&s;&s;olute, by opening an a&s;ylum to
them, and their families, from the di&s;ea&s;es of po|verty
and intemperance: for it remains to be
proved, that the pari&s;h rates are decrea&s;ed, the
bills of mortality le&s;&s;ened, the people more nu|merous,
or the &s;treets le&s;s infe&s;ted with beggars,
notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e &s;ums yearly granted
by individuals for the relief of the indigent.</P>
<P>But, waving the&s;e reflections, doctor Fathom
hoped, that his landlord would be a mo&s;t u&s;eful
implement for extending his influence, and, for
that rea&s;on, admitted him into a degree of part|ner&s;hip,
after being fully convinced, that he was
not under articles to any other phy&s;ician. Never|thele&s;s,
he was very much mi&s;taken in reckoning
on the importance of this new ally, who was, like
him&s;elf, a needy adventurer, &s;ettled upon credit,
and altogether unemployed, except among the ve|ry
refu&s;e of the people, whom no other per&s;on
would take the trouble to attend: &s;o that our
hero got little el&s;e than experience and trouble,
excepting a few guineas, which he made &s;hift to
glean among &s;ojourners, with whom he became
occa&s;ionally acquainted, or young people, who
had been unfortunate in their amours.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e endeavours, he did not
omit his duty to the old gentlewoman, who&s;e
daughter he had cured at Tunbridge; and was
always received with particular complacency,
<PB N="149" REF="150">
which, perhaps, he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, owed to
his genteel equipage, that gave credit to every
door before which it was &s;een; yet Mi&s;s Biddy
was as inacce&s;&s;ible as ever, while the mother be|came
more and more warm in her civilities, 'till
at length, after having prepared him with &s;ome
extraordinary compliments, &s;he gave him to un|der&s;tand,
that Biddy was no better than a giddy-headed
girl, far from being unexceptionable in her
moral character, and particularly deficient in duty
and gratitude to her, who had been always a ten|der
and indulgent parent; &s;he was therefore de|termined
to puni&s;h the young minx, for her levi|ty,
and want of natural affection, by altering her
own condition, could &s;he find a worthy and
agreeable man, on whom &s;he could be&s;tow her
hand and fortune without a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>The film was in&s;tantly removed from Fathom's
eyes by this declaration, which &s;he uttered with
&s;uch a &s;ignificancy of look, as thrilled to his &s;oul
with joyful pre&s;age, while he replied, it would,
indeed, be a difficult ta&s;k to find a man who me|rited
&s;uch happine&s;s and honour; but, &s;urely,
&s;ome there were, who would ta&s;k their faculties
to the uttermo&s;t, in manife&s;ting their gratitude,
and de&s;ire of rendering them&s;elves worthy of &s;uch
di&s;tinction. Though this an&s;wer was pronounced
in &s;uch a manner, as gave her to under&s;tand he
had taken the hint, &s;he would not cheapen her
conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;o much as to explain her&s;elf fur|ther
at that juncture, and he was very well con|tented
to wooe her on her own terms; accord|ingly
he began to &s;ea&s;on his behaviour with a &s;pice
of gallantry, when he had opportunities of being
particular with this new inamorata, and, in pro|portion
to the returns &s;he made, he gradually de|tached
<PB N="150" REF="151">
him&s;elf from Mi&s;s Biddy, by intermitting,
and, at la&s;t, di&s;continuing tho&s;e ardent expre&s;&s;ions
of love and admiration, which he had made &s;hift
to convey in private looks and &s;tolen whi&s;pers,
during the rancorous in&s;pection of her mother.</P>
<P>Such alteration could not long e&s;cape the jea|lous
eyes of the young lady, no more than the
cau&s;e of this alienation, which, in a moment,
converted all her love into irreconcilable hate,
and filled her whole &s;oul with the mo&s;t eager de|&s;ire
of vengeance: for &s;he now not only con&s;i|dered
him as a mercenary wretch, who had &s;light|ed
her attractions for the &s;ordid gratifications of
avarice, but al&s;o as an interloper, who wanted
to intercept her fortune, in the odious character
of a father-in-law. But, before &s;he could bring
her aim to any ripene&s;s of contrivance, her mo|ther
having caught cold at church, was &s;eized
with a rheumatic fever, became delirious in le&s;s
than three days, and, notwith&s;tanding all the
pre&s;criptions and care of her admirer, gave up the
gho&s;t, without having retrieved the u&s;e of her
&s;en&s;es, or been able to manife&s;t, by will, the &s;en|timents
&s;he entertained in favour of her phy&s;ician,
who (as the reader will ea&s;ily perceive) had more
rea&s;ons than one, to be mortally chagrined at this
event.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Biddy being thus put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
whole inheritance, not only renounced all cor|re&s;pondence
with doctor Fathom, by forbidding
him the hou&s;e, but likewi&s;e took all opportuni|ties
of prejudicing his character, by hinting, that
her dear mamma had fallen a &s;acrifice to his ig|norance
and pre&s;umption.</P>

<P>THESE ill offices, however, far from an|&s;wering
her purpo&s;e, had a quite contrary
effect: for, in con&s;equence of her invectives, he
was, in a few days, called to the wife of a mer|chant,
who piou&s;ly hoped, that his practice would
not give Mi&s;s Biddy the lie. The patient had long
lingered under a complication of di&s;tempers, and
being in no immediate danger of her life, doctor
Fathom was in no hurry to &s;trike a deci&s;ive
&s;troke; till the hu&s;band growing impatient of
delay, and &s;o explicite in his hints, that it was
impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;apprehend his meaning, our ad|venturer
re&s;olved to do &s;omething effectual for
his &s;atisfaction, and pre&s;cribed a medicine of &s;uch
rough operation, as he thought, mu&s;t either oblige
his employer, or produce a change in the lady's
con&s;titution, that would make a noi&s;e in the
world, and bring a new acce&s;&s;ion to his fame.</P>
<P>Proceeding upon the&s;e maxims, he could not
be di&s;appointed: the remedy played its part with
&s;uch violence, as reduced the patient to extremi|ty,
and the merchant had actually be&s;poke an
undertaker; when, after a &s;eries of &s;woonings
and convul&s;ions, nature &s;o far prevailed, as to
expel, at once, the pre&s;cription and the di&s;ea&s;e;
yet the good-natured hu&s;band was &s;o much affect|ed
with the agonies to which he &s;aw the wife of
his bo&s;om expo&s;ed by this &s;pecific, that, although
the effect of it was her perfect recovery, he ne|ver
could bear the &s;ight of Fathom, for the fu|ture,
<PB N="152" REF="153">
nor even hear his name mentioned, with|out
giving &s;igns of horror and indignation: nay,
he did not &s;cruple to affirm, that had our adven|turer
been endowed with the lea&s;t tincture of hu|manity,
he would have &s;uffered the poor woman
to depart in peace, rather than re&s;tore her to
health, at the expence of &s;uch anxiety and tor|ture.</P>
<P>On the other hand, this extraordinary cure was
blazoned abroad by the good lady, and her go&s;|&s;ips,
with &s;uch exaggerations as rou&s;ed the a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of the publick, and concurred with the
report of his la&s;t mi&s;carriage, to bring him upon
the carpet, as the univer&s;al &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e.
When a phy&s;ician becomes the town talk, he ge|nerally
concludes his bu&s;ine&s;s more than half
done, even though his fame &s;hould wholly turn
upon his mal-practice; in&s;omuch that &s;ome
members of the faculty have been heard to com|plain,
that they never had the good fortune to be
publickly accu&s;ed of homicide; and it is well
known, that a certain famous empyrick, of our
day, never flouri&s;hed to any degree of wealth and
reputation, till after he had been attacked in print,
and fairly convicted of having de&s;troyed a good
number of the human &s;pecies. Succe&s;s rai&s;ed
upon &s;uch a foundation, would, by a di&s;ciple of
Plato, and &s;ome modern morali&s;ts, be a&s;cribed
to the innate virtue and genero&s;ity of the human
heart, which naturally e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e that
needs protection: but I, who&s;e notions of human
excellence are not quite &s;o &s;ublime, am apt to be|lieve
it is owing to that &s;pirit of &s;elf-conceit and
contradiction, which is, at lea&s;t, as univer&s;al, if
not as natural, as the moral &s;en&s;e &s;o warmly con|tended
for by tho&s;e ideal philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">
The mo&s;t infamous wretch often finds his ac|count
in the&s;e principles of malevolence and &s;elf-love:
for where&s;oever his character falls under
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, there is generally &s;ome per&s;on pre&s;ent,
who, either from an affectation of &s;ingularity, or
envy to the accu&s;ers, undertakes his defence, and
endeavours to invalidate the articles of his im|peachment,
until he is heated by altercation, and
hurried into more effectual mea&s;ures for his ad|vantage.
If &s;uch benefits accrue to tho&s;e who
have no real merit to depend upon; &s;urely, our
hero could not but reap &s;omething extraordinary
from the debates to which he now gave ri&s;e; as
by the miraculous cure he had effected, all his
patient's friends, all the enemies of her hu&s;band,
all tho&s;e who envied his other adver&s;ary, were in|tere&s;ted
in his behalf, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch admirers
as &s;urprize and curio&s;ity might engage in his
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus wafted upon the wings of applau&s;e, his
fame &s;oon diffu&s;ed it&s;elf into all the corners of this
great capital: the news-papers teemed with his
prai&s;e; and in order to keep up the attention of
the publick, his emi&s;&s;aries, male and female, &s;e|parated
into different coffee-hou&s;es, companies,
and clubs, where they did not fail to comment
upon the&s;e articles of intelligence. Such a fa|vourable
incident is, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to float
the bark of a man's fortune: he was, in a few
days; called to another lady, labouring under the
&s;ame di&s;order he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;pelled, and
&s;he thought her&s;elf benefited by his advice. His
acquaintance naturally extended it&s;elf among the
vi&s;itants and allies of his patients; he was recom|mended
from family to family: the fees began to
multiply; a variety of footmen appeared every
<PB N="154" REF="155">
day at his door; he di&s;continued his &s;ham circuit,
and looking upon the pre&s;ent conjuncture, as
that tide in his affairs, which (according to Shake|&s;pear)
when taken at the full, leads on to for|tune,
he re&s;olved, that the opportunity &s;hould
not be lo&s;t, and applied him&s;elf with &s;uch a&s;&s;idui|ty
to his practice, that, in all likelihood, he would
have carried the palm from all his cotemporaries,
had not he &s;plit upon the &s;ame rock which had
&s;hipwrecked his hopes before.</P>
<P>We have formerly de&s;canted upon that vene|real
appetite, which glowed in the con&s;titution
of our adventurer, and which all his philo&s;ophy
and caution could hardly keep within bounds:
the reader, therefore, will not be much &s;urpri&s;ed,
to learn, that, in the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion,
he contracted an intimacy with a clergyman's
wife, whom he attended as a phy&s;ician, and
who&s;e conjugal virtue he &s;ubdued by a long and
diligent exertion of his delu&s;ive arts, while her
mind was enervated by &s;ickne&s;s, and her hu&s;|band
abroad upon his nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions. This
unhappy patient, who was a woman of an agree|able
per&s;on, and lively conver&s;ation, fell a &s;acri|fice
to her own &s;ecurity and &s;elf-conceit: her
want of health had confined her to a &s;edentary
life, and her imagination being active and re&s;t|le&s;s,
&s;he had &s;pent tho&s;e hours in reading, which
other young women devote to company and di|ver&s;ion:
but, as her &s;tudies were not &s;uperintend|ed
by any per&s;on of ta&s;te, &s;he had indulged her
own fancy without method or propriety. The
Spectator taught her to be a critick and philo&s;o|pher;
from plays &s;he learned poetry and wit; and
derived her knowledge of life from books of
hi&s;tory and adventures. Fraught with the&s;e ac|qui&s;itions,
<PB N="155" REF="156">
and furni&s;hed by nature with uncom|mon
vivacity, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed her own &s;ex, and
courted the &s;ociety of men, among whom &s;he
thought her talents might be more honourably
di&s;played; fully confident of her own virtue and
&s;agacity, which enabled her to &s;et all their arts at
defiance.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, &s;he, in an evil hour, had re|cour&s;e
to the advice of our adventurer, for &s;ome
ailment under which &s;he had long laboured; and
&s;ound &s;uch relief from his &s;kill, as very much
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her in his favour: &s;he was no le&s;s
plea&s;ed with his obliging manners, than with his
phy&s;ick; and found much entertainment in his
conver&s;ation, &s;o that the acquaintance proceeded
to a degree of intimacy; during which, he per|ceived
her weak &s;ide, and being enamoured of
her per&s;on, flattered her out of all her caution:
The privilege of his character furni&s;hed him with
opportunities to lay &s;nares for her virtue, and
taking advantage of that li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, languor, and
indolence of the &s;pirits, by which all the vigilance
of the &s;oul is relaxed, he, after a long cour&s;e of
attention and per&s;everance, found means to make
&s;hipwreck of her peace.</P>
<P>Though he ma&s;tered her cha&s;tity, he could
not quiet her con&s;cience, which ince&s;&s;antly up|braided
her with breach of the marriage vow;
nor did her undoer e&s;cape without a &s;hare of the
reproaches &s;ugge&s;ted by her penitence and re|mor&s;e.
This internal anxiety co-operating with
her di&s;ea&s;e, and, perhaps, with the medicines he
pre&s;cribed, reduced her to the brink of the grave;
when her hu&s;band returned from a neighbouring
kingdom, in con&s;equence of her earne&s;t reque&s;t,
joined to the information of her friends, who had
<PB N="156" REF="157">
written to him an account of the extremity in
which &s;he was. The good man was afflicted be|yond
mea&s;ure, when he &s;aw him&s;elf upon the
verge of lo&s;ing a wife whom he had always ten|derly
loved: but, what were his emotions, when
&s;he, taking the fir&s;t opportunity of his being alone
with her, acco&s;ted him to this effect: &startq;I am
now ha&s;tening towards that di&s;&s;olution, from
which no mortal is exempted; and though the
pro&s;pect of futurity is altogether clouded and un|certain,
my con&s;cience will not allow me to
plunge into eternity, without unburthening my
mind, and by an ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion, making
all the atonement in my power, for the ingrati|tude
I have been guilty of, and the wrongs I have
committed again&s;t a virtuous hu&s;band, who never
gave me cau&s;e of complaint. You &s;tand amazed
at this preamble; but, alas! how will you be
&s;hocked when I own that I have betrayed you in
your ab&s;ence; that I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t God
and my marriage-vow, and fallen from the pride
and confidence of virtue, to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate
of vice: yes, I have been unfaithful to your bed,
having fallen a victim to the infernal in&s;inuations
of a villain, who took advantage of my weak and
unguarded moments. Fathom is the wretch who
hath thus injured your honour, and ruined my
un&s;u&s;pecting innocence. I have nothing to plead
in alleviation of my crime, but the mo&s;t &s;incere
contrition of heart; and though, at any other
juncture, I could not expect your forgivene&s;s,
yet, as I now touch the goal of life, I tru&s;t in
your humanity and benevolence, for that pardon
which will lighten the &s;orrows of my &s;oul, and
tho&s;e prayers which I hope will entitle me to fa|vour
at the throne of grace.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
The poor hu&s;band was &s;o much overwhelmed
with grief and confu&s;ion, at this unexpected ad|dre&s;s,
that he could not recollect him&s;elf till after
a pau&s;e of &s;everal minutes, when uttering a hol|low
groan, &startq;I will not (&s;aid he) aggravate your
&s;ufferings, by reproaching you with my wrongs;
though your conduct hath been but an ill return
for all my tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem. I look upon it
as a trial of my chri&s;tian patience, and bear my
misfortune with re&s;ignation: mean while, I for|give
you from my heart, and fervently pray, that
your repentance may be acceptable to the father
of mercy.&endq; So &s;aying, he approached her bed|&s;ide,
and embraced her in token of his &s;incerity.
Whether this generous conde&s;cen&s;ion diffu&s;ed &s;uch
a compo&s;ure upon her &s;pirits, as tended to the
ea&s;e and refre&s;hment of nature, which had been
almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by di&s;ea&s;e and vexation; cer|tain
it is, that, from this day, &s;he began to &s;trug|gle
with her malady in &s;urpri&s;ing efforts; and
hourly gained ground, until her health was pretty
well re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This recovery was &s;o far beyond the hu&s;band's
expectation, that he began to make very &s;erious
reflections on the event, and even to wi&s;h he had
not been quite &s;o precipitate in pardoning the
back&s;lidings of his wife: for, though he could
not withhold his compa&s;&s;ion from a dying peni|tent,
he did not at all reli&s;h the thoughts of co|habiting,
as u&s;ual, with a wife, &s;elf-convicted of
the violation of the matrimonial contract: he
therefore con&s;idered his declaration as no more
than a provi&s;ional pardon, to take place on con|dition
of her immediate death; and, in a little
time, not only communicated to her his &s;enti|ments
on this &s;ubject; but al&s;o &s;eparated him&s;elf
<PB N="158" REF="159">
from her company, &s;ecured the evidence of her
maid, who had been confidante in her amour
with Fathom, and immediately &s;et on foot a pro|&s;ecution
again&s;t our adventurer, who&s;e behaviour
to his wife, he did not fail to promulgate, with
all its aggravating circum&s;tances. By the&s;e means
the doctor's name became &s;o notorious, that every
man was afraid of admitting him into his hou&s;e,
and every woman a&s;hamed of &s;olliciting his ad|vice.</P>

<P>All the&s;e mi&s;haps treading upon the heels of

of them had fore&s;een, that &s;he would, &s;ome time

were canva&s;&s;ed; in all clubs of married
men, he was mentioned with marks of abhor|rence
and dete&s;tation; and every medical coffee-hou&s;e

the credit he had acquired by the punctuality of
his former payments. Both the&s;e funds, how|ever,
failed in a very little time: his law-&s;uit was

among his own &s;ex, who alone were able to &s;up|port
him in his di&s;grace with the other. He ac|cordingly
li&s;ted him&s;elf in &s;everal clubs, and en|deavoured
to monopolize the venereal branch of
trade: tho' this was but an indifferent re&s;ource;
for almo&s;t all his patients of this cla&s;s, were &s;uch
as either could not, or would not properly recom|pence
the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, he lingered in this &s;ituation,
without going upwards or downwards, floating
like a wi&s;p of &s;traw, at the turning of the tide,
until he could no longer amu&s;e the per&s;on of
whom he had hired his coach hor&s;es, or po&s;tpone
the other demands, which multiplied upon him
every day. Then was his chariot overturned with
a hideous cra&s;h, and his face &s;o much wounded
with the &s;hivers of the gla&s;s, which went to pieces
in the fall, that he appeared in the coffeehou&s;e
with half a dozen black patches upon his counte|nance,
gave a mo&s;t circum&s;tantial detail of the
ri&s;que he had run, and declared, that he did not
believe he &s;hould ever hazard him&s;elf again in any
&s;ort of wheel carriage.</P>
<P>Soon after this accident, he took an opportuni|ty
of telling his friends, in the &s;ame public place,
that he had turned away his footman, on account
of his drunkenne&s;s, and was re&s;olved, for the fu|ture,
to keep none but maids in his &s;ervice, be|cau&s;e
the men &s;ervants are generally impudent,
lazy, debauched, or di&s;hone&s;t; and, after all,
neither &s;o neat, handy, or agreeable as the other
&s;ex. In the rear of this re&s;olution, he &s;hifted
his lodgings into a private court, being di&s;tracted
with the din of carriages, that di&s;turb the inhabi|tants
<PB N="161" REF="162">
who live towards the open &s;treet; and gave
his acquaintance to under&s;tand, that he had a
medical work upon the anvil, which he could not
fini&s;h without being indulged in &s;ilence and tran|quillity.
In effect, he gradually put on the ex|teriors
of an author: his watch, with an hori|zontal
movement by Graham, which he had often
mentioned, and &s;hewn as a very curious piece of
workman&s;hip, began, about this time, to be very
much out of order, and was committed to the
care of a mender, who was in no hurry to re|&s;tore
it. His tye-wig degenerated into a major;
he &s;ometimes appeared without a &s;word, and was
even ob&s;erved in public with a &s;econd day's &s;hirt:
at la&s;t, his cloaths became ru&s;ty, and when he
walked about the &s;treets, his head turned round
in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, by an involuntary motion
in his neck, which he had contracted hy an habit
of reconnoitering the ground, that he might
avoid all dangerous or di&s;agreeable encounters.</P>
<P>Fathom, finding him&s;elf de&s;cending the hill of
fortune, with an acquired gravitation, &s;trove to
catch at every twig, in order to &s;top or retard his
de&s;cent. He now regretted the opportunities he
had neglected, of marrying one of &s;everal women
of moderate fortune, who had made advances to
him, in the zenith of his reputation; and endea|voured,
by forcing him&s;elf into a lower path of
life than any he had hitherto trod, to keep him|&s;elf
afloat, with the portion of &s;ome trade&s;man's
daughter, whom he meant to e&s;pou&s;e. While he
exerted him&s;elf in this pur&s;uit, he happened, in
returning from a place about thirty miles from
London, to become acquainted, in the &s;tage
coach, with a young woman, of a very homely
appearance, whom, from the driver's informa|tion,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
he under&s;tood to be the niece of a country
ju&s;tice, and daughter of a &s;oap-boiler, who had
lived and died in London, and left her, in her
infancy, &s;ole heire&s;s of his effects, which amount|ed
to four thou&s;and pounds. The uncle, who
was her guardian, had kept her &s;acred from the
knowledge of the world, re&s;olving to effect a
match betwixt her and his own &s;on; and it was
with much difficulty he had con&s;ented to this
journey, which &s;he had undertaken as a vi&s;it to
her own mother, who had married a &s;econd hu&s;|band
in town.</P>
<P>Fraught with the&s;e anecdotes, Fathom began
to put forth his gallantry and good humour, and,
in a word, was admitted by the lady, to the pri|vilege
of an acquaintance, in which capacity he
vi&s;ited her during the term of her re&s;idence in
London; and as there was no time to be lo&s;t, de|clared
his honourable intentions: he had &s;uch a
manife&s;t advantage, in point of per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments,
over the young gentleman who was
de&s;tined for her hu&s;band, that &s;he did not di&s;dain
his propo&s;als, and before &s;he &s;et out for the coun|try,
he had made &s;uch progre&s;s in her heart, that
the day was actually fixed for their nuptials, on
which he faithfully promi&s;ed to carry her off in a
coach and &s;ix. How to rai&s;e money for this ex|pedition,
was all the difficulty that remained:
for, by this time, his finances were utterly dried
up, and his credit altogether exhau&s;ted. Upon
a very pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, he had formerly applied
him&s;elf to a certain wealthy quack, who had re|lieved
his nece&s;&s;ities by lending him a &s;mall &s;um
of money, in return for having communicated to
him a &s;ecret medicine, which he affirmed to be
the mo&s;t admirable &s;pecifick that ever was in|vented.
<PB N="163" REF="164">
The no&s;trum had been u&s;ed, and luckily
for him, &s;ucceeded in the trial; &s;o that the em|pyrick,
in the mid&s;t of his &s;atisfaction, began to
reflect, that this &s;ame Fathom, who pretended to
be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great many remedies, equally
efficacious, would certainly become a formidable
rival to him, in his bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould he ever be
able to extricate him&s;elf from his pre&s;ent difficul|ties.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, he re|&s;olved
to keep our adventurer's head under wa|ter,
by maintaining him in the mo&s;t abject de|pendance;
accordingly he had, from time to
time, accommodated him with &s;mall trifles, which
barely &s;erved to &s;upport his exi&s;tence, and even
for the&s;e had taken notes of hand, that he might
have a &s;courge over head, in ca&s;e he &s;hould prove
in&s;olent or refractory. To this benefactor, Fa|thom
applied for a reinforcement of twenty gui|neas,
which he &s;ollicited with the more confi|dence,
as that &s;um would certainly enable him to
repay all other obligations. The quack would
advance the money upon no other condition,
than that of knowing the &s;cheme, which being
explained, he complied with Ferdinand's re|que&s;t;
but, at the &s;ame time, privately di&s;patch|ed
an expre&s;s to the young lady's uncle, with a
full account of the whole con&s;piracy; &s;o that
when the doctor arrived at the inn, according to
appointment, he was received by his wor&s;hip, in
per&s;on, who gave him to under&s;tand, that his
niece had changed her mind, and gone fifty miles
farther into the country to vi&s;it a relation. This
was a grievous di&s;appointment to Fathom, who
really believed his mi&s;tre&s;s had for&s;aken him thro'
mere levity and caprice, and was not undeceived
<PB N="164" REF="165">
till &s;everal months after her marriage with her
cou&s;in, when, at an accidental meeting in Lon|don,
&s;he explained the &s;tory of the &s;ecret intelli|gence,
and excu&s;ed her marriage, as the effect of
rigorous u&s;age and compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>Had our hero been really enamoured of her
per&s;on, he might have, probably, accompli&s;hed
his wi&s;hes, notwith&s;tanding the &s;teps &s;he had ta|ken:
but this was not the ca&s;e; his pa&s;&s;ion was
of a different nature, and the object of it effec|tually
without his reach. With regard to his ap|petite
for women, as it was an infirmity of his
con&s;titution, which he could not overcome, and as
he was in no condition to gratify it at a great ex|pence,
he had of late cho&s;en an hou&s;ekeeper from
the hundreds of Drury, and to avoid &s;candal, al|lowed
her to a&s;&s;ume his name. As to the inti|mation
which had been &s;ent to the country ju&s;tice,
he immediately imputed it to the true author,
whom he marked for his vengeance accordingly,
but, in the mean time, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment,
becau&s;e he, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depended upon him
for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. On the other hand, the quack,
dreading the forwardne&s;s and plau&s;ibility of our
hero, which might, one time or other, render
him independent, put a &s;top to tho&s;e &s;upplies, on
pretence of finding them inconvenient; but, out
of his friend&s;hip and good will to Fathom, under|took
to procure for him &s;uch letters of recom|mendation,
as would infallibly make his fortune in
the We&s;t-Indies, and even to fit him out in a
genteel manner for the voyage. Ferdinand per|ceived
his drift, and thanked him for his generous
offer, which he would not fail to con&s;ider with
all due deliberation: though he was determined
again&s;t the propo&s;al, but obliged to temporize,
<PB N="165" REF="166">
that he might not incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of this
man, at who&s;e mercy he lay. Mean while the
pro&s;ecution again&s;t him, in Doctors Commons,
drew near a period, and the lawyers were clamor|ous
for money, without which he fore&s;aw he
&s;hould lo&s;e the advantage which his cau&s;e had
lately acquired by the death of his antagoni&s;t's
chief evidence: he therefore, &s;eeing every other
channel &s;hut up, began to doubt, whether the
ri&s;que of being apprehended or &s;lain in the cha|racter
of an highwayman, was not over-ballanced
by the pro&s;pect of being acquitted of a charge
which had ruined his reputation and fortune, and
actually entertained thoughts of taking the air on
Houn&s;low Heath, when he was diverted from this
expedient by a very &s;ingular adventure.</P>

the matrimonial noo&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>CHANCING to meet with one of his ac|quaintance
at a certain coffeehou&s;e, the
di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the characters of mankind,
when, among other oddities, his friend brought
upon the carpet a certain old gentlewoman of
&s;uch a rapacious di&s;po&s;ition, that, like a jack-daw,
&s;he never beheld any metalline &s;ub&s;tance without
an inclination, and even an effort to &s;ecrete it for
her own u&s;e and contemplation: nor was this in|firmity
originally produced from indigence, in|a&s;much
as her circum&s;tances had been always af|fluent,
and &s;he was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable
&s;um of money in the funds; notwith&s;tanding
which, the avarice of her nature tempted her to
<PB N="166" REF="167">
let lodgings, though few people could live under
the &s;ame roof with &s;uch an original, who, rather
than be idle, had often filched pieces of her own
plate, and charged her &s;ervants with the theft, or
hinted &s;u&s;picion of her lodgers. Fathom, &s;truck
with the de&s;cription, &s;oon perceived how this wo|man's
di&s;ea&s;e might be converted to his advan|tage;
and after having obtained &s;ufficient intelli|gence,
on pretence of &s;atisfying his curio&s;ity, he
vi&s;ited the widow, in con&s;equence of a bill at
her door, and actually hired an apartment in her
hou&s;e, whither he forthwith repaired with his
inamorata. It was not long before he perceived,
that his landlady's character had not been mi&s;re|pre&s;ented;
he fed her di&s;temper with divers in|con&s;iderable
trinkets, &s;uch as copper medals, cork
&s;crews, odd buckles, and a paultry &s;eal &s;et in &s;il|ver,
which were, at different times, laid as baits
for her infirmity, and always convey'd away with
remarkable eagerne&s;s, which he and his Dulcinea
took plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving from an un&s;u&s;pected
place. Thus confirmed in his opinion, he, at
length, took an opportunity of expo&s;ing a metal
watch that belonged to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;aw it
&s;eized, with great &s;atisfaction, in the ab&s;ence of
his help-mate, who had gone abroad on purpo&s;e.
According to in&s;truction, &s;he &s;oon returned, and
began to rai&s;e a terrible clamour about the lo&s;s of
her watch; upon which &s;he was condoled by her
landlady, who &s;eemed to doubt the integrity of
the maid, and even propo&s;ed, that Mrs. Fathom
&s;hould apply to &s;ome ju&s;tice of the peace, for a
warrant to &s;earch the &s;ervant's trunk. The lady
thanked her for the good advice, in compliance
with which, &s;he had immediate recour&s;e to a ma|gi&s;trate,
who granted a &s;earch warrant, not a|gain&s;t
<PB N="167" REF="168">
the maid, but the mi&s;tre&s;s: and &s;he, in a
little time, returned with the con&s;table at her
back.</P>
<P>The&s;e precautions being taken, doctor Fa|thom
de&s;ired a private conference with the old
gentlewoman, in which he gave her to under|&s;tand,
that he had undoubted proofs of her having
&s;ecreted, not only the watch, but al&s;o &s;everal other
odd things, of le&s;s con&s;equence, which he had lo&s;t
&s;ince his re&s;idence in her hou&s;e: he then &s;hewed
the warrant he had obtained again&s;t her, and a&s;k|ed,
if &s;he had any thing to offer, why the con|&s;table
&s;hould not do his duty. Inexpre&s;&s;ible were
the angui&s;h and confu&s;ion of the defendant, when
&s;he found her&s;elf thus entrapped, and reflected,
that &s;he was on the point of being detected of fe|lony;
for &s;he at once concluded, that the &s;nare
was laid for her, and knew, that the officer of
ju&s;tice would certainly find the unlucky watch in
one of the drawers of her &s;crutore.</P>
<P>Tortured with the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, afraid of pub|lic
di&s;grace, and dreading the con&s;equence of le|gal
conviction, &s;he fell on her knees before the
injured Fathom, and, after having imputed her
crime to the temptations of nece&s;&s;ity, implored
his compa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed to re&s;tore the watch,
and every thing &s;he had taken, and begged he
would di&s;mi&s;s the con&s;table, that her reputation
might not &s;uffer in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, with a &s;everity of countenance pur|po&s;ely
a&s;&s;umed, ob&s;erved, that were &s;he really in|digent,
he had charity enough to forgive what &s;he
had done; but, as he knew her circum&s;tances
were opulent, he looked upon this excu&s;e as an
aggravation of her guilt, which was certainly the
effect of a vicious inclination; and he was there|fore
<PB N="168" REF="169">
determined to pro&s;ecute her with the utmo&s;t
&s;everity of the law, as an example and terror to
others, who might be infected with the &s;ame evil
di&s;po&s;ition. Finding him deaf to all her tears and
intreaties, &s;he changed the note, and offered him
one hundred guineas, if he would compromi&s;e the
affair, and drop the pro&s;ecution, &s;o as that her
character &s;hould &s;u&s;tain no damage: after much
argumentation, he con&s;ented to accept of double
the &s;um, which being in&s;tantly paid in Ea&s;t-India
bonds, doctor Fathom told the con&s;table, that the
watch was found; and for once her reputation
was patched up. This &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply enabled
our hero to &s;tand trial with his adver&s;ary, who was
non&s;uited, and al&s;o to mend his external appear|ance,
which of late had not been extremely mag|nificent.</P>
<P>Soon after this gleam of good fortune, a trade&s;|man,
to whom he was con&s;iderably indebted, &s;ee|ing
no other probable means to recover his mo|ney,
introduced Fathom to the acquaintance of a
young widow who lodged at his hou&s;e, and was
&s;aid to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable fortune,
Con&s;idering the &s;teps that were taken, it would
have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to mi&s;carry
in his addre&s;&s;es: the lady had been bred in the
country, was unacquainted with the world, and
of a very &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition, which her &s;hort
trial of matrimony had not &s;erved to cool. Our
adventurer was in&s;tructed to call at the trade&s;|man's
hou&s;e, as if by accident, at an appointed
time, when the widow was drinking tea with her
landlady: on the&s;e occa&s;ions he always behaved
to admiration. She liked his per&s;on, and prai&s;ed
his politene&s;s, good humour, and good &s;en&s;e: his
confederates extolled him as a prodigy of learn|ing,
<PB N="169" REF="170">
ta&s;te, and good nature: they likewi&s;e repre|&s;ented
him as a per&s;on on the eve of eclip&s;ing all
his competitors in phy&s;ick: an acquaintance and
intimacy &s;oon en&s;ued, nor was he re&s;tricted in
point of opportunity. In a word, he &s;ucceeded
in his endeavours, and one evening, on pretence
of attending her to the play, he accompanied her
to the Fleet, where they were married, in pre&s;ence
of the trade&s;man and his wife, who were of the party.</P>
<P>This grand affair being accompli&s;hed to his
&s;atisfaction, he, next day, vi&s;ited her brother,
who was a coun&s;ellor of the Temple, to make
him acquainted with the &s;tep his &s;i&s;ter had taken;
and though the lawyer was not a little mortified,
to find &s;he had made &s;uch a clande&s;tine match, he
behaved civilly to his new brother-in-law, and
gave him to under&s;tand, that his wife's fortune
con&s;i&s;ted of a jointure of one hundred and fifty
pounds a year, and fifteen hundred pounds be|queathed
to her during her widowhood, by her
own father, who had taken the precaution of &s;et|tling
it in the hands of tru&s;tees, in &s;uch a manner
as that any hu&s;band &s;he might afterwards e&s;pou&s;e,
&s;hould be re&s;tricted from encroaching upon the
capital, which was re&s;erved for the benefit of her
heirs. This intimation was far from being agree|ble
to our hero, who had been informed, that
this &s;um was ab&s;olutely at the lady's di&s;po&s;al, and
had actually de&s;tined the greate&s;t part of it for the
pa$ment of his debts, for defraying the expence
of furni&s;hing an elegant hou&s;e, and &s;etting up a
new equipage.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appointment, he re|&s;olved
to carry on his plan, upon the credit
of his marriage, which was publi&s;hed in a very
pompous article of the news papers; a cha|riot
<PB N="170" REF="171">
was be&s;poke, a ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e imme|diately
taken, and doctor Fathom began to re|appear
in all his former &s;plendor.</P>
<P>His good friend the empirick, alarmed at this
event, which not only rai&s;ed our adventurer into
the &s;phere of a dangerous rival, but al&s;o furni&s;hed
him with means to revenge the ill office he had
&s;u&s;tained at his hands, on the adventure of the
former match; for, by this time, Fathom had
given him &s;ome hints, importing, that he was not
ignorant of his treacherous behaviour: rou&s;ed, I
&s;ay, by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he employed one of
his emi&s;&s;aries, who had &s;ome knowledge of Fa|thom's
brother-in-law, to prejudice him again&s;t
our adventurer, whom he repre&s;ented as a needy
&s;harper, not only overwhelmed with debt and
di&s;grace, but likewi&s;e previou&s;ly married to a poor
woman, who was prevented by nothing but want,
from &s;eeking redre&s;s at law. To confirm the&s;e
a&s;&s;ertions, he gave him a detail of Fathom's in|cumbrances,
which he had learned for the pur|po&s;e,
and even brought the coun&s;ellor in company
with the per&s;on who had lived with our hero be|fore
marriage, and who was &s;o much incen&s;ed at
her abrupt di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, that &s;he did not &s;cruple to
corroborate the&s;e allegations of the informer.</P>
<P>The lawyer, &s;tartled at this intelligence, &s;et
on foot a minute inquiry into the life and con|ver&s;ation
of the doctor, which turned out &s;o little
to the advantage of his character and circum|&s;tances,
that he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;unite
him from his family, and as a previous &s;tep, re|peated
to his &s;i&s;ter, all that he had heard to the
prejudice of her hu&s;band, not forgetting to pro|duce
the evidence of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who laid claim
to him by a prior title, which, &s;he pretended,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
could be proved by the te&s;timony of the clergy|man
who joined them. Such an explanation could
not fail to inflame the re&s;entment of the injured
wife, who, at the very fir&s;t opportunity, giving
a loo&s;e to the impetuo&s;ity of her temper, upbraid|ed
our hero with the mo&s;t bitter invectives for his
perfidious dealing.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, con&s;cious of his own innocence,
which he had not always to plead, far from at|tempting
to &s;ooth her indignation, a&s;&s;umed the
authority and prerogative of an hu&s;band, and
&s;harply reprehended her for her credulity and in|decent
warmth. This rebuke, in&s;tead of &s;ilencing,
gave new &s;pirit and volubility to her reproaches,
in the cour&s;e of which, &s;he plainly taxed him
with want of hone&s;ty and affection, and &s;aid, that
though his pretence was love, his aim was no
other than a ba&s;e de&s;ign upon her fortune.</P>
<P>Fathom, &s;tung with the&s;e accu&s;ations, which
he really did not de&s;erve, replied with uncommon
heat, and charged her, in his turn, with want of
&s;incerity and candour, in the fal&s;e account &s;he had
given of that &s;ame fortune, before marriage: he
even magnified his own conde&s;cen&s;ion, in &s;ur|rendering
his liberty to a woman, who had &s;o
little to recommend her to the addre&s;&s;es of the
other &s;ex; a reflection which provoked this mild
creature to &s;uch a degree of animo&s;ity, that, for|getting
her duty and allegiance, &s;he lent him a
box on the ear, with &s;uch energy as made his
eyes water; and he, for the honour of his man|hood
and &s;overeignty, having wa&s;hed her face
with a di&s;h of tea, withdrew abruptly, to a coffee|hou&s;e
in the neighbourhood, where he had not
long remained, when his pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided, and
he then &s;aw the expediency of an immediate re|conciliation,
<PB N="172" REF="173">
which he re&s;olved to purcha&s;e, even
at the expence of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was pity that &s;uch a &s;alutary re&s;olution had
not been &s;ooner taken: for when he returned to
his own hou&s;e, he under&s;tood, that Mrs. Fathom
had gone abroad in an hackney coach; and upon
examining her apartment, in lieu of her cloaths
and trinkets, which &s;he had removed with admira|ble
dexterity and di&s;patch, he found this billet in
one of the drawers of her buroe. &startq;Sir, being
convinced that you are a cheat and an impo&s;tor,
I have withdrawn my&s;elf from your cruelty and
machinations, with a view to &s;ollicit the pro|tection
of the law; and I doubt not but I &s;hall
&s;oon be able to prove, that you have no ju&s;t title
to, or demand upon the per&s;on or effects of the
$nfortunate Sarah Muddy.&endq;</P>
<P>The time had been when Mr. Fathom would
have allowed Mrs. Muddy to refine at her lei&s;ure,
and ble&s;&s;ed God for his happy deliverance; but at
pre&s;ent the ca&s;e was quite altered. Smarting as
he was, from the expence of law &s;uits, he dreaded
a pro&s;ecution for bigamy, which (though he had
ju&s;tice on his &s;ide) he knew he could not of him|&s;elf
&s;upport: be&s;ides, all his other &s;chemes of life
were fru&s;trated by this unlucky elopement: he
therefore &s;peedily determined to anticipate, as
much as in him lay, the malice of his enemies,
and to obtain, without delay, authentic documents
of his marriage. With this view he ha&s;tened to
the hou&s;e of the trade&s;man, who, with his wife,
had been witne&s;s to the ceremony and con&s;um|mation;
and, in order to intere&s;t them the more
warmly in his cau&s;e, made a pathetic recital of
this unhappy breach, in which he had &s;uffered
&s;uch injury and in&s;ult: but all his rhetoric would
<PB N="173" REF="174">
not avail; Mrs. Muddy had been beforehand
with him, and proved the better orator of the
two; for &s;he had a&s;&s;ailed this hone&s;t couple with
&s;uch tropes and figures of eloquence, as were alto|gether
irre&s;i&s;tible. Neverthele&s;s, they heard $word$
hero, to an end, with great patience: then the
wife, who was the common mouth, upon all &s;uch
occa&s;ions, contracting her features into a very
formal di&s;po&s;ition, &startq;I'll a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid &s;he,
doctor Fathom, my hu&s;band and I have been in
a very great terrification and numbplu&s;h, to hear
&s;uch bad things of a per&s;on, whom, as one may
&s;ay, we thought a worthy gentleman, and were
ready to &s;erve at all times, by day and by night, as
the &s;aying is; and be&s;ides, for all that, you know,
and God knows, as we are du&s;trious people, and
work hard for what we get, and we have &s;erved
gentlemen to our own harm, whereby my hu&s;band
was la&s;t tue&s;day &s;erved with a &s;i&s;erary, being that
he was bound for an officer that ran away: and I
&s;aid to my hu&s;band, Timothy, &s;ays I, 'tis a very
hard thing for one to ruin one's &s;elf for &s;tranger
people. There's doctor Fathom, &s;ays I, his ac|count
comes to nine and forty pounds &s;even
&s;hillings and four-pence half-penny; and you
know, doctor, that was before your la&s;t bill be|gan:
but, how&s;omever, little did I think, as how
a gentleman of your learning, would go to de|ceive
a poor gentlewoman, when you had another
wife alive.&endq;</P>
<P>In vain did our adventurer endeavour to vindi|cate
him&s;elf from this a&s;per&s;ion; the good wo|man,
like a great many modern di&s;putants, pro|ceeded
with her declamation, without &s;eeming to
hear what was &s;aid on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion;
and the hu&s;band was altogether neutral.
<PB N="174" REF="175">
At length, Ferdinand finding all his prote&s;tations
ineffectual, &startq;Well, &s;aid he, though you are re|&s;olved,
I &s;ee, to di&s;credit all that I can &s;ay in op|po&s;ition

&s;ignifying, that you were pre&s;ent at the ceremony
of my marriage with this unhappy woman.&endq;
&startq;You &s;hall excu&s;e us; (replied the female ora|tor)

been brought to ruination by &s;igning his name,
and my hu&s;band &s;hall not, with my good will,
draw him&s;elf into &s;uch a primmineery.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom, alarm'd at this refu&s;al, earne&s;tly argued
again&s;t the inhumanity and inju&s;tice of it, appeal|ing
to their own con&s;ciences for the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s
of his propo&s;al; but, from the eva&s;ive an|&s;wers
of the wife, he had rea&s;on to believe, that,
long before the time of trial, they would take
care to have forgotten the whole tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Though he was equally confounded and in|cen&s;ed
at this in&s;tance of their perfidy, he dur&s;t
not manife&s;t his indignation, con&s;cious of the ad|vantage
they had over him in divers re&s;pects;
but repaired, without lo&s;s of time, to the lodging
of the clergyman who had noo&s;ed him, re&s;olved
to con&s;ult his regi&s;ter, and &s;ecure his evidence.
Here too his evil genius had got the &s;tart of him,
for the worthy eccle&s;ia&s;tic not only could not re|collect
his features, or find his name in the regi&s;ter;
but, when importuned by his pre&s;&s;ing remon|&s;trances,
took umbrage at the freedom of his be|haviour,
and threatened, if he would not imme|diately
take him&s;elf away, to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e of the
Fleet, for the &s;afety of his own per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">
Rather than put the pa&s;tor to the trouble of alarm|ing
his flock, he retreated with a heavy heart, and
went in que&s;t of his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
at his marriage, in hopes of effecting a reconciliati|on,
and preventing her from joining in the con&s;pira|cy
again&s;t him; but, alas, he met with &s;uch a re|ception,
as he had rea&s;on to expect from a &s;lighted
woman, who had never felt any real attachment
for his per&s;on. She did not upbraid him with his
cruelty, in leaving her as a mi&s;tre&s;s, but, with a
&s;pecies of effrontery, never enough to be admir|ed,
reproached him with his villainy, in aban|doning
her, who was his true and lawful wi&s;e,
to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by who&s;e
fortune he had been allured.</P>
<P>When he attempted to expo&s;tulate with this
virago, upon the barbarity of this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;he

<P>THE la&s;t re&s;ource, and that upon which he
lea&s;t depended, was the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of his old friend the empirick, with whom
he &s;till maintained a &s;light corre&s;pondence; and
to who&s;e hou&s;e he &s;teered his cour&s;e, in great

and protection, faithfully recapitulated all the

affair, as well as with want of hone&s;ty in this la&s;t

finally, reminded him of his notes, which he de|&s;ired
might be immediately taken up, as he (the
quack) had pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for a &s;um of money.</P>
<P>Ferdinand &s;eeing it would be impracticable to
derive any &s;uccour from this quarter, &s;neaked
homewards, in order to hold a con&s;ultation with
his own thoughts; and the fir&s;t object that pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf to his eyes, when he entered his apart|ment,
was a letter from the trade&s;man, with his
account inclo&s;ed, amounting to fifty-five pounds,
which the writer de&s;ired might be paid without
delay. Before he had time to peru&s;e the articles,
he received a &s;ummons, in con&s;equence of a bill
of indictment for bigamy, found again&s;t him in
Hicks's-hall, by Sarah Muddy, widow; and while
he was revolving mea&s;ures to avert the&s;e &s;torms,
another billet arrived from a certain attorney,
giving him to under&s;tand, that he had orders from
doctor Buffalo, the quack, to &s;ue him for the pay|ment
of &s;everal notes, unle&s;s he would take them
up in three days from the date of this letter.</P>
<P>Such a concurrence of &s;ini&s;ter events, made a
deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of our adventurer:
all his fortitude was in&s;ufficient to bear him up
again&s;t this torrent of misfortunes; his re&s;ources
were all dried up, his invention failed, and his
reflection began to take a new turn. &startq;To what
purpo&s;e (&s;aid he to him&s;elf) have I de&s;erted the
paths of integrity and truth, and exhau&s;ted a fruit|ful
imagination, in contriving &s;chemes to betray
my fellow-creatures; if, in&s;tead of acquiring a
&s;plendid fortune, which was my aim, I have &s;uf|fered
&s;uch a &s;eries of mortifications, and at la&s;t
brought my&s;elf to the brink of inevitable de&s;truc|tion?
<PB N="177" REF="178">
By a virtuous exertion of tho&s;e talents I
inherit from nature and education, I might, long
before this time, have rendered my&s;elf indepen|dent,
and, perhaps, con&s;picuous in life: I might
have grown up like a young oak, which being
$$mly rooted in its kindred &s;oil, gradually rai&s;es
up its lofty head, expands its leafy arms, projects
a noble &s;hade, and towers the glory of the plain:
I &s;hould have paid the debt of gratitude to my be|nefactors,
and made their hearts &s;ing with joy for
the happy effects of their benevolence; I &s;hould
have been a bulwark to my friends, a &s;helter to
my neighbours in di&s;tre&s;s; I &s;hould have run the
race of honour, &s;een my &s;ame diffu&s;ed like a
&s;weet-&s;melling odour, and felt the ineffable plea|&s;ure
of doing good: whereas I am, after a vici&s;|&s;itude
of di&s;appointments, dangers and fatigues,
reduced to mi&s;ery and &s;hame, aggravated by a
con&s;cience loaded with treachery and guilt. I
have abu&s;ed the confidence and genero&s;ity of my
patron; I have defrauded his family, under the
ma&s;k of &s;incerity and attachment; I have taken
the mo&s;t cruel and ba&s;e advantages of virtue in

<P>The&s;e reflections, which, perhaps, the mi&s;ery of
his fellow creatures would never have in&s;pired, had
he him&s;elf remained without the verge of misfor|tune,
were now produced from the &s;en&s;ation of
his own calamities; and, for the fir&s;t time, his
cheeks were bedewed with the drops of penitence
and &s;orrow. Contraries, &s;aith Plato, are produc|tive
of each other. Reformation is oftentimes
generated from un&s;ucce&s;sful vice; and our ad|venturer
was, at this juncture, very well di&s;po&s;ed
to turn over a new leaf, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e
&s;alutary &s;ugge&s;tions; though he was far from be|ing
cured beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a relap&s;e: on
the contrary, all the faculties of his &s;oul were &s;o
well adapted, and had been &s;o long habituated to
deceit, that in order to extricate him&s;elf from the
evils that environed him, he would not, in all pro|bability,
have &s;crupled to practi&s;e it upon his own
father, had a convenient opportunity occurred.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, he certainly, after a te|dious
and fruitle&s;s exerci&s;e of his invention, re|&s;olved
to effect a clande&s;tine retreat from that con|federacy
of enemies which he could not with&s;tand,
and once more join his fortune to that of Renaldo,
whom he propo&s;ed to &s;erve, for the future, with
fidelity and affection, thereby endeavouring to at|tone
for the treachery of his former conduct.
Thus determined, he packed up his nece&s;&s;aries in
a portmanteau, attempted to amu&s;e his creditors
with promi&s;e of &s;peedy payment, and ventur|ing
to come forth in the dark, took a place
in the Canterbury &s;tage coach, after having
converted his &s;uperfluities into ready money.
The&s;e &s;teps were not taken with &s;uch priva|cy,
as to elude the vigilance of his adver&s;a|ries;
<PB N="179" REF="180">
for although he had been cautious enough
to tran&s;port him&s;elf and his baggage to the inn,
on &s;unday evening, and never doubted, that the
vehicle, which &s;et out at four o'clock on monday
morning, would convey him out of the reach of
his creditors, before they could po&s;&s;ibly obtain a
writ for &s;ecuring his per&s;on; they had actually ta|ken
&s;uch precautions as fru&s;trated all his fine&s;&s;e;
and the coach being &s;topt in the Borough of South|wark,
doctor Fathom was &s;eized by virtue of a
warrant obtained on a criminal indictment, and
was forthwith conducted to the pri&s;on of the King's
Bench; yet not before he had, by his pathetic
remon&s;trances, excited the compa&s;&s;ion, and even
drawn tears from the eyes of his fellow pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner recollected him&s;elf from the
&s;hock which mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by this
&s;ini&s;ter incident, than he di&s;patched a letter to
his brother-in-law the coun&s;ellor, reque&s;ting an
immediate conference, in which he promi&s;ed to
make &s;uch a propo&s;al, as would &s;ave him all the
expence of a law-&s;uit and trial, and at the &s;ame
time effectually an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of both.
He was accordingly favoured with a vi&s;it from the
lawyer, to whom, after the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;ta|tions
of his own innocence, he declared, that,
finding him&s;elf unable to wage war again&s;t &s;uch
powerful antagoni&s;ts, he had re&s;olved even to a|bandon
his indubitable right, and retire into ano|ther
country, in order to &s;creen him&s;elf from per|&s;ecution,
and remove all cau&s;e of di&s;quiet from the
pro&s;ecutrix, when he was unfortunately prevented
by the warrant which had been executed again&s;t
him. He &s;aid he was &s;till willing, for the &s;ake of
his liberty, to &s;ign a formal renunciation of his
preten&s;ions to Mrs. Fathom and her fortune, pro|vided
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the deeds could be executed, and the watant
withdrawn, before he &s;hould be detained b$
his other creditors; and la&s;tly, he conjured the
barri&s;ter to &s;pare him&s;elf the guilt and the charge
of &s;uborning evidence for the de&s;truction of an
unhappy man, who&s;e mi&s;fortune was his only fault.</P>
<P>The lawyer felt the force of his expo&s;tulations,
and though he would by no means &s;uppo&s;e him
innocent of the charge of bigamy, yet, under the
pretext of humanity and commi&s;eration, he un|dertook
to per&s;uade his &s;i&s;ter to accept of a proper
relea&s;e, which he ob&s;erved would not be binding,
if executed during the confinement of Fathom;
he therefore took his leave in order to prepare the
papers, withdraw the action, and take &s;uch other
mea&s;ures as would hinder the pri&s;oner from giving
him the &s;lip. Next day he returned with an or|der
to relea&s;e our hero, who being formally di&s;|charged,
was conducted, by the lawyer, to a ta|vern
in the neighbourhood, where the relea&s;es
were exchanged, and every thing concluded with
amity and concord. This bu&s;ine&s;s being happily
tran&s;acted, Fathom &s;tept into an hackney coach
with his baggage, and was followed by a bail$ff,
who told him, with great compo&s;ure&punc; that he was
again a pri&s;oner at the &s;uit of doctor Buffalo, and
de&s;ired the coachman to reconduct him to the
lodging he had &s;o lately di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Fathom, who&s;e fortitude had been hitherto of
the pagan temper, was now fain to reinforce it with
the philo&s;ophy of chri&s;tian re&s;ignation, tho' he had
not as yet arrived to &s;uch a pitch of &s;elf-denial, as
to forgive the coun&s;ellor, to who&s;e double dealing
he imputed this new calamity. After having re|ceived
the compliments of the jailor on his re|commitment,
he took pen, ink, and paper, and
<PB N="181" REF="182">
compo&s;ed an artful and affecting epi&s;tle to the
empirick, imploring his mercy, flattering his
weakne&s;s, and demon&s;trating the bad policy of
cooping up an unhappy man in a jail, where he
could never have an opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to
his creditors; nor did he forget to declare his in|tention
of retiring into another country, where he
might have &s;ome chance of earning a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
which he had &s;o long toiled for to no purpo&s;e in
England. This la&s;t declaration he made in con|&s;equence
of the jealous di&s;po&s;ition of the quack,
who, he knew, had long looked upon him in the
odious light of an interloping rival. However, he
reaped no benefit from this &s;upplication, which
&s;erved only to gratify the pride of Buffalo, who
produced the extravagant encomiums which Fa|thom
had be&s;towed upon him, as &s;o many te&s;ti|monials
of his foe's bearing witne&s;s to his virtue.</P>

bleak, inho&s;pitable Greenland &s;hore. This, the
reader will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, was no other than the
remembrance of the forlorn Monimia, who&s;e image
appeared to his fancy in different attitudes, accord|ing
to the prevalence of the pa&s;&s;ions, which raged

came &s;till in the rear of this recollection; &s;o that
his &s;oul was by turns agitated by the tempe&s;ts of
horror, and overwhelmed by the floods of grief.</P>
<P>He recalled the moment on which he fir&s;t beheld
her, with that plea&s;ing regret which attends the
memory of a dear decea&s;ed friend; then he bit|terly
cur&s;ed it, as the &s;ource of all his misfortunes

him with a friend to detect her perfidy and in|gratitude;
then ardently wi&s;hed he had &s;till con|tinued
under the influence of her delu&s;ion. In a
word, the loneline&s;s of his &s;ituation aggravated
every horror of his reflection; for, as he found

never &s;ollicited, or his attention diverted from
the&s;e &s;ubjects of woe; and he travelled to Bru&s;|&s;els
in a reverie, fraught with &s;uch torments as
mu&s;t have entirely wrecked his rea&s;on, had not

laid for &s;upper, and as the ordinary is open
to &s;trangers, in all tho&s;e hou&s;es of entertainment,
he introduced him&s;elf into the company, with a

either the number or countenances of tho&s;e
who were pre&s;ent: though he him&s;elf did not re|main
&s;o unregarded. His mein and deportment
produced a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour; and the
air of affliction, &s;o remarkable in his vi&s;age, did
not fail to attract their &s;ympathy and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, was an Iri&s;h officer in the Au|&s;trian

to the confidence of the count, as to learn the
cau&s;e of that di&s;tre&s;s which he had ob&s;erved in his
features at their fir&s;t meeting; and being a gen|tleman
of uncommon vivacity, as well as &s;incere|ly
attached to the family of Melvile, to which he
had owed his promotion; he exerted all his good
humour and good &s;en&s;e, in amu&s;ing the fancy,
and rea&s;oning down the mortification of the afflict|ed
Hungarian. He, in particular, endeavoured to
wean his attention from the lo&s;t Monimia, by
engaging it upon his dome&s;tic affairs, and upon
the wrongs of his mother and &s;i&s;ter, who, he gave
him to under&s;tand, were langui&s;hing under the
tyranny of his father-in-law.</P>
<P>This was a note that effectually rou&s;ed him from
the lethargy of his &s;orrow; and the de&s;ire of taking
vengeance on the oppre&s;&s;or, who had ruined his
fortune, and made his neare&s;t relations mi&s;erable,
&s;o intirely engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts, as to leave no
room for other con&s;iderations. During their jour|ney
to Au&s;tria, major Farrel (that was the name
of his fellow-traveller) informed him of many
circum&s;tances touching his father's hou&s;e, to which
him&s;elf was an utter &s;tranger.</P>
<P>&startq;The conduct of your mother, &s;aid he, in mar|rying
count Treba&s;i, was not at all agreeable either
to the friends of the count de Melvile, or to her own
relations, who knew her &s;econd hu&s;band to be a
man of a violent temper, and rapacious di&s;po&s;ition,
which the nature of his education and employment,
had &s;erved rather to inflame than allay; for you
well know he was a partizan during the whole
cour&s;e of the late war. They were, moreover, e|qually
&s;urprized and chagrined, when they found &s;he
took no &s;tep to prevent his &s;eizing upon that in|heritance
which of right belonged to you, and
<PB N="185" REF="186">
which, by the laws of Hungary, is unalienable
from the heir of blood: neverthele&s;s, they are
now fully convinced, that &s;he hath more than &s;uf|ciently
attoned for her indi&s;cretion, by the barba|rity
of her hu&s;band, who hath not only &s;ecluded
her from all communication with her friends and
acquaintance, but even confined her to the we&s;t
tower of your father's hou&s;e, where &s;he is &s;aid to
be kept clo&s;e pri&s;oner, and &s;ubjected to all &s;orts of
inconvenience and mortification. This &s;everity
&s;he is believed to have incurred, in con&s;equence of
having expo&s;tulated with him upon his unju&s;t be|haviour
to you and mademoi&s;elle, whom he hath
actually &s;hut up in &s;ome convent in Vienna, which
your relations have not as yet been able to di&s;co|ver:
but the memory of your noble father is &s;o
dear to all tho&s;e who were favoured with his friend|&s;hip;
and the &s;ufferings of the counte&s;s and made|moi&s;elle
have rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit of re&s;entment a|gain&s;t
her cruel jailor, that nothing is wanted but
your pre&s;ence, to begin the pro&s;ecution, and give
a &s;anction to the mea&s;ures of your friends, which
will, in a little time, re&s;tore your family to the
fruition of its rights and fortune: for my own
part, my dear count, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as one
wholly indebted to your hou&s;e, for the rank and
expectation I now enjoy, and my finances, inte|re&s;t,
and per&s;on, &s;uch as they are, I dedicate to
your &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo was not &s;low in making his acknow|ledgments
to this generous Hibernian, whom he
informed of his &s;cheme, recounting to him his
uncommon tran&s;action with the benevolent Jew,
and communicating the letters of recommenda|tion
he had received by his means, to &s;ome of the
fir&s;t noblemen at the Imperial court. Mean while,
<PB N="186" REF="187">
he burned with impatience, to cha&s;ti&s;e count Tre|ba&s;i
for his per&s;idious conduct to the widow and
the fatherle&s;s, and would have taken the road to
Pre&s;burg, without touching at Vienna, in order to
call him to a &s;evere account, had not he been &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed by major Farrel, who repre&s;ented
the imprudence of taking &s;uch a &s;tep before he
had &s;ecured a proper protection from the con&s;e|quences
with which it might be attended.</P>
<P>&startq;It is not,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;your own life and for|tune
only which depend upon your behaviour in
this emergency, but al&s;o the quiet and happine&s;s
of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t dear to your affection:
not you alone, but likewi&s;e your mother and &s;i&s;ter
would infallibly &s;uffer by your temerity and preci|pitation.
Fir&s;t of all, deliver your credentials at
court, and let us join our endeavours to rai&s;e an
intere&s;t &s;trong enough to counterbalance that of
Treba&s;i. If we &s;ucceed, there will be no nece&s;|&s;ity
for having recour&s;e to per&s;onal mea&s;ures: he
will be compelled to yield up your inheritance
which he unju&s;tly detains, and to re&s;tore your
&s;i&s;ter to your arms; and if he afterwards refu&s;es
to do ju&s;tice to the counte&s;s, you will always
have it in your power to evince your&s;elf the &s;on
of the brave count de Melvile.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e ju&s;t and &s;alutary repre&s;entations had a
due effect upon Renaldo, who no &s;ooner arrived
at the capital of Au&s;tria, than he waited upon a
certain prince of di&s;tinction, to who&s;e patronage
he was commended; and from whom he met
with a very cordial reception, not only on ac|count
of his credentials, but al&s;o for the &s;ake of
his father, who was well known to his highne&s;s.
He heard his complaints with great patience and
affability, a&s;&s;ured him of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and pro|tection,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
and even undertook to introduce him to
the empre&s;s queen, who would not &s;uffer the
weake&s;t of her &s;ubjects to be oppre&s;&s;ed, much
le&s;s di&s;regard the cau&s;e of an injured young no|bleman
who by his own &s;ervices and tho&s;e of his
family was peculiarly intitled to her favour.</P>
<P>Nor was he the only per&s;on who&s;e counte|nance
and patronage Melvile &s;ollicited upon this
occa&s;ion; he vi&s;ited all the friends of his father,
and all his mother's relations, who were ea&s;ily in|tere&s;ted
in his behalf; while major Farrel contri|buted
all his efforts in &s;trengthening the a&s;&s;ocia|tion.
So that a law-&s;uit was immediately com|menced
again&s;t count Treba&s;i, who on his &s;ide
was not idle, but prepared with incredible in|du&s;try
for the a&s;&s;ault, re&s;olving to maintain with
his whole power the acqui&s;ition he had made.</P>
<P>The laws of Hungary, like tho&s;e of &s;ome other
countries I could name, afford &s;o many &s;ubter|fuges
for the purpo&s;es of perfidy and fraud, that
it is no wonder our youth began to complain of
the &s;low progre&s;s of his affair; e&s;pecially as he
glowed with the mo&s;t eager de&s;ire of redre&s;&s;ing
the grievances of his parent and &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e &s;uf|ferings
he did not doubt were doubled &s;ince the
in&s;titution of his proce&s;s again&s;t their tormentor.
He imparted his &s;entiments on this head to his
friend; and, as his apprehen&s;ion every moment
increa&s;ed, plainly told him he could no longer
live without making &s;ome effort to &s;ee tho&s;e with
whom he was &s;o nearly connected in point of
blood and affection: he therefore re&s;olved to re|pair
immediately to Pre&s;burg, and according to
the intelligence he &s;hould procure, e&s;&s;ay to &s;ee
and conver&s;e with his mother, tho' at the hazard
of his life.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Renaldo abridges the proceedings at law, and ap|proves
him&s;elf the &s;on of his father.</HEAD>
<P>THE major finding him determined, in&s;i&s;ted
upon attending him in his expedition, and
they &s;et out together for Pre&s;burg, where they
privately arrived in the dark, re&s;olving to keep
them&s;elves concealed at the hou&s;e of a friend, un|til
they &s;hould have formed &s;ome plan for their
future operations. Here they were informed that
count Treba&s;i's ca&s;tle was altogether inacce&s;&s;ible;
that all the &s;ervants who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have
the lea&s;t veneration or compa&s;&s;ion for the coun|te&s;s,
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and that &s;ince Renaldo was
known to be in Germany, the vigilance and cau|tion
of that cruel hu&s;band were redoubled to &s;uch
a degree, that no body knew whether his un|fortunate
lady was actually alive or dead.</P>
<P>Farrel perceiving Melvile exceedingly affected
with this intimation, and hearing him declare
that he would never quit Pre&s;burg until he &s;hould
have entered the hou&s;e, and removed his doubts
on that intere&s;ting &s;ubject; not only argued with
great vehemence again&s;t &s;uch an attempt, as equal|ly
dangerous and indi&s;creet, but &s;olemnly &s;wore
he would prevent his purpo&s;e, by di&s;covering his
de&s;ign to the family, unle&s;s he would promi&s;e to
li&s;ten to a more moderate and fea&s;ible expedient.
He then propo&s;ed that he him&s;elf &s;hould appear
in the equipage of one of tho&s;e travelling Savoy|ards
who &s;troll about Europe, amu&s;ing ignorant
people with the effects of a magic lanthorn, and
in that di&s;gui&s;e endeavour to obtain admittance
<PB N="189" REF="190">
from the &s;ervants of Treba&s;i, among whom he
might make &s;uch inquiries, as would deliver Mel|vile
from his pre&s;ent unea&s;y &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was embraced, tho' reluctantly
by Renaldo, who was unwilling to expo&s;e his
friend to the lea&s;t danger or di&s;grace; and the
major being next day provided with the habit and
implements of his new profe&s;&s;ion, together with
a ragged attendant who preceded him, extorting
mu&s;ic from a paultry viole, approached the ca&s;tle|gate,
and proclaimed his &s;hew &s;o naturally in a
yell partaking of the &s;cream of Savoy and the
howl of Ireland, that one would have imagined he
had been conductor to madam Catherina from his
cradle. So far his &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded: he had
not long &s;tood in waiting, before he was invited
into the court-yard, where the &s;ervants formed a
ring, and danced to the efforts of his companion's
&s;kill; then he was conducted into the buttery,
where he exhibited his figures on the wall and his
prince&s;s on the floor; and while they regaled him
in this manner with &s;craps and &s;our wine, he took
occa&s;ion to inquire about the old lady and her
daughter, before whom he &s;aid he had performed
in his la&s;t peregrination. Tho' this que&s;tion was
a&s;ked with all that air of &s;implicity which is pe|culiar
to the&s;e people, one of the dome&s;tics took
the alarm, being infected with the &s;u&s;picions of
his ma&s;ter, and plainly taxed the major with be|ing
a &s;py, threatening at the &s;ame time that he
&s;hould be &s;tripped and &s;earched.</P>
<P>This would have been a very dangerous expe|riment
for the Hibernian, who had actually in his
pocket a letter to the counte&s;s from her &s;on,
which he hoped fortune might have furni&s;hed him
with an opportunity to deliver. When he there|fore
<PB N="190" REF="191">
found him&s;elf in this dilemma, he was not at
all ea&s;y in his own mind: however, in&s;tead of
prote&s;ting his innocence in an humble and be|&s;eeching
&s;train, in order to acquit him&s;elf of the
charge, he re&s;olved to elude the &s;u&s;picion by pro|voking
the wrath of his accu&s;er, and putting on
the air of vulgar integrity affronted, began to re|proach
the &s;ervant in very in&s;olent terms for his
unfair &s;uppo&s;ition, and undre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in a mo|ment
to the &s;kin, threw his tattered garments in
the face of his adver&s;ary, telling him he would
find nothing there which he would not be very
glad to part with; at the &s;ame time rai&s;ing his
voice, he, in the gibberi&s;h of the clan he repre|&s;ented,
&s;colded and cur&s;ed with great fluency:
&s;o that the whole hou&s;e re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e.
The valet's jealou&s;y, like a &s;maller fire, was in a
trice &s;wallowed up in the greater flame of his rage
enkindled by this abrupt addre&s;s: in con&s;equence
of which, Farrel was kicked out at the gate,
naked as he was to the wai&s;t, after his lanthorn
had been broke to pieces on his head; and there
he was joined by his dome&s;tic, who had not been
able to recover his apparel and effect a retreat,
without incurring marks of the &s;ame &s;ort of di&s;|tinction.</P>
<P>The major, con&s;idering the ri&s;k he mu&s;t have
run in being detected, thought him&s;elf cheaply
quit for this moderate di&s;cipline, though he was
really concerned for his friend Renaldo, who un|der&s;tanding
the particulars of the adventure, de|termined,
as the la&s;t effort, to ride round the
ca&s;tle in the open day, on pretence of taking the
air, when, peradventure, the counte&s;s would &s;ee
him from the place of her confinement, and fa|vour
<PB N="191" REF="192">
him with &s;ome mark or token of her being
alive.</P>
<P>Though his companion did not much reli&s;h this
plan, which he fore&s;a$ would expo&s;e him to the
in&s;ults of Treba&s;i; yet, as he could not contrive
a better, he acquie&s;ced in Renaldo's invention,
with the provi&s;o, that he would defer the execu|tion
of it until his father-in-law &s;hould be ab&s;ent
in the cha&s;e, which was a diver&s;ion he every day
enjoyed.</P>
<P>Accordingly they &s;et a proper watch, and lay
concealed until they were informed of Treba&s;i's
having gone forth; when they mounted their
hor&s;es, and rode into the neighbourhood of the
ta&s;tle. Having made a &s;mall excur&s;ion in the ad|joining
fields, they drew nearer the walls, and
at an ea&s;y pace had twice circled them, when
Farrel de&s;cried at the top of a tower, a white
handkerchief waved by a woman's hand thro' the
iron bars that &s;ecured the window. This &s;ignal
being pointed out to Renaldo, his heart began to
throb with great violence; he made a re&s;pectful
obei&s;&s;ance towards the part in which it appeared,
and perceiving the hand beckoning him to ap|proach,
advanced to the very buttre&s;s of the tur|ret;
upon which, &s;eeing &s;omething drop, he
alighted with great expedition, and took up a pic|ture
of his father in miniature, the features of
which he no &s;ooner di&s;tingui&s;hed, than the tears
ran down his cheeks; he pre&s;&s;ed the little image
to his lips with the mo&s;t filial fervour; then con|veying
it to his bo&s;om, looked up to the hand,
which waved in &s;uch a manner, as gave him to
under&s;tand it was high time to retire. Being by
this time highly per&s;uaded that his kind monitor
was no other than the counte&s;s her&s;elf, he pointed
<PB N="192" REF="193">
to his heart, in token of his filial affection, and
laying his hand on his &s;word, to denote his re&s;o|lution
of doing her ju&s;tice, he took his leave with
another profound bow, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to
be reconducted to his lodging.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance of this tran&s;action was ob|&s;erved
by the &s;ervants of count Treba&s;i, who im|mediately
di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to their lord,
with an account of what had happened. Alarm|ed
at this information, from which he immediate|ly
concluded that the &s;tranger was young Mel|vile,
he forthwith quitted the chace, and return|ing
to the ca&s;tle by a private po&s;tern, ordered his
hor&s;e to be kept ready &s;addled, in hope that his
&s;on-in-law would repeat the vi&s;it to his mother.
This precaution would have been to no purpo&s;e,
had Renaldo followed the advice of Farrel, who
repre&s;ented the danger of returning to a place
where the alarm was undoubtedly given by his
fir&s;t appearance; and exhorted him to return to
Vienna for the pro&s;ecution of his &s;uit, now that
he was &s;atisfied of his mother's being alive: in
order to &s;trengthen this admonition, he bad him
recollect the &s;ignal for withdrawing, which was
doubtle&s;s the effect of maternal concern, in&s;pired
by the knowledge of the count's vigilance and vin|dictive
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, Melvile per|&s;i&s;ted
in his re&s;olution of appearing once more be|low
the tower, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his mo|ther,
in expectation of his return, had prepared
a billet for his acceptance, from which he might
obtain important intelligence. The major &s;eeing
him lend a deaf ear to his remon&s;trances, was
contented to attend him in this &s;econd $span$
he pre&s;&s;ed him to undertake that &s;am$
<PB N="193" REF="194">
afternoon, as Treba&s;i had taken care to circu|late
a report of his having gone to dine at the
&s;eat of a nobleman in the neighbourhood. Our
knight-errant and his &s;quire, deceived by this
fine&s;&s;e, pre&s;ented them&s;elves again under the pri|&s;on
of the counte&s;s, who no &s;ooner beheld her
&s;on return, than &s;he earne&s;tly intreated him to
be gone, by the &s;ame &s;ign which &s;he had before
u&s;ed; and he taking it for granted that &s;he was
debarred the u&s;e of pen, ink and paper, and that
he had nothing more to expect, con&s;ented to
retire, and had already moved to &s;ome di&s;tance
from the hou&s;e, when, in cro&s;&s;ing a &s;mall plan|tation
that belonged to the ca&s;tle, they were met
by count Treba&s;i and another per&s;on on hor&s;e|back.</P>
<P>At &s;ight of this apparition, the blood mounted
into Renaldo's cheeks, and his eyes began to
lighten with eagerne&s;s and indignation; which
was not at all dimini&s;hed by the ferocious ad|dre&s;s
of the count, who, advancing to Melvile,
with a menacing air, &startq;Before you proceed,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;I mu&s;t know with what view you
have been twice to-day patroling round my in|clo&s;ures,
and reconnoitring the different avenues
of my hou&s;e: you likewi&s;e carry on a clande&s;tine
corre&s;pondence with &s;ome per&s;on in the family,
of which my honour obliges me to demand an ex|planation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Had your actions been always regulated by
the dictates of honour; replied Renaldo, I &s;hould
never have been que&s;tioned for riding round that
ca&s;tle which you know is my rightful inheritance;
or excluded from the &s;ight of a parent who &s;uffers
under your tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. It is my part,
therefore, to expo&s;tulate; and, &s;ince fortune hath
<PB N="194" REF="195">
favoured me with an opportunity of revenging our
wrongs in per&s;on, we &s;hall not part until you have
learned that the family of the count de Melvile is
not to be injured with impunity. Here is no ad|vantage
on either &s;ide, in point of arms or num|ber,
you are better mounted than I am, and &s;hall
have the choice of the ground on which our
difference ought to be brought to a &s;peedy deter|mination.&endq;</P>
<P>Treba&s;i, who&s;e courage was not of the &s;enti|mental
kind, but purely owing to his natural in|&s;en&s;ibility
of danger, in&s;tead of concerting mea|&s;ures
coolly for the engagement, or making any
verbal reply to this defiance, drew a pi&s;tol with|out
the lea&s;t he&s;itation, and fired it at the face of
Renaldo, part of who&s;e left eye brow was carried
off by the ball. Melvile was not &s;low in return|ing
the compliment, which, as it was deliberate,
proved the more deci&s;ive: for the &s;hot entering
the count's right brea&s;t, made its way to the back
bone with &s;uch a &s;hock, as &s;truck him to the
ground; upon which the other alighted, in or|der
to improve the advantage he had gained.</P>
<P>During this tran&s;action, Farrel had well nigh
lo&s;t his life by the &s;avage behaviour of Treba&s;i's
attendant, who had been a hu&s;&s;ar officer, and
who thinking it was his duty to imitate the ex|ample
of his patron on this occa&s;ion, di&s;charged
a pi&s;tol at the major before he had the lea&s;t in|timation
of his de&s;ign. The Hibernian's hor&s;e
being a common hireling, and unaccu&s;tomed to
&s;tand fire, no &s;ooner &s;aw the fla&s;h of Treba&s;i's
pi&s;tol, than &s;tarting a&s;ide, he happened to plunge
into a hole, and was overturned at the very in|&s;tant
when the hu&s;&s;ar's piece went off, &s;o that no
damage en&s;ued to his rider, who pitching on his
<PB N="195" REF="196">
feet, flew with great nimblene&s;s to his adver&s;ary,
then laying hold on one leg, di&s;mounted him in a
twinkling, and &s;eizing his throat as he lay, would
have &s;oon di&s;patched him without the u&s;e of fire|arms,
had he not been prevented by his friend
Renaldo, who de&s;ired him to de&s;i&s;t, ob&s;erving
that his vengeance was already &s;atisfied, as the
count &s;eemed to be in the agonies of death. The
major was loth to quit his prey, as he thought
his aggre&s;&s;or had acted in a treacherous manner;
but recollecting that there was no time to lo&s;e,
becau&s;e, in all probability, the firing had alarmed
the ca&s;tle, he took his leave of the vanqui&s;hed hu&s;|&s;ar,
with a couple of hearty kicks, and mounting
his hor&s;e, followed Melvile to the hou&s;e of a gen|tleman
in the neighbourhood, who was kin&s;man
to the counte&s;s, and very well di&s;po&s;ed to grant
him a &s;ecure retreat, until the trouble&s;ome con|&s;equences
of this rencounter &s;hould be over|blown.</P>
<P>Treba&s;i, though to the young gentleman he
&s;eemed &s;peechle&s;s and in&s;en&s;ible, had neither lo&s;t
the u&s;e of his rea&s;on, nor of his tongue, but af|fected
that extremity, in order to avoid any fur|ther
conver&s;ation with the victor. He was one
of tho&s;e people who never think of death until he
knocks at the door, and then earne&s;tly intreat
him to excu&s;e them for the pre&s;ent, and be &s;o
good as to call another time. The count had &s;o
often e&s;caped unhurt, in the cour&s;e of his cam|paigns,
that he looked upon him&s;elf as invulne|rable,
and &s;et all danger at defiance. Though
he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of
his &s;oul, he had a large fund of &s;uper&s;tition at

his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors
<PB N="196" REF="197">
of futurity took hold on his imagination, and all
the mi&s;demeanours of his life pre&s;ented them&s;elves
in aggravated colours to his recollection.</P>
<P>He implored the &s;piritual a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good
prie&s;t in the neighbourhood, who, in the di&s;|charge
of his own con&s;cience, gave him to under|&s;tand,
that he had little mercy to expect, unle&s;s
he would, as much as lay in his power, redre&s;s
the injuries he had done to his fellow-creatures.
As nothing lay heavier upon his &s;oul than the
cruelty and fraud he had practi&s;ed upon the fami|ly
of count Melvile, he earne&s;tly be&s;ought this
charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with
the counte&s;s, and at the &s;ame time de&s;ired to &s;ee
Renaldo before his death, that he might put him
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his paternal e&s;tate, and &s;ollicit his
forgivene&s;s for the offence he had given.</P>
<P>His lady, far from waiting for the prie&s;t's in|terce&s;&s;ion,
no &s;ooner under&s;tood the lamentable
&s;ituation of her hu&s;band, and found her&s;elf at li|berty,
than &s;he ha&s;tened to his apartment, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
the utmo&s;t concern for his misfortune, and
tended him with truly conjugal tenderne&s;s and
fidelity. Her &s;on gladly obeyed the &s;ummons,
and was received with great civility and &s;atisfac|tion
by his father-in-law, who, in pre&s;ence of the
judge and divers gentlemen a&s;&s;embled for that pur|po&s;e,
renounced all right and title to the fortune
he had &s;o unju&s;tly u&s;urped; di&s;clo&s;ed the name
of the convent to which mademoi&s;elle de Mel|vile
he had been conveyed, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the agents of
his iniquity, and being reconciled to his &s;on-in-law,
began to prepare him&s;elf in tranquillity for
his latter end.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s was overwhelmed with an ex|ce&s;s
of joy, while &s;he embraced her long lo&s;t &s;on,
<PB N="197" REF="198">
who had proved him&s;elf &s;o worthy of his father.
Yet this joy was imbittered, by reflecting that &s;he
was made a widow by the hands of that darling
&s;on: for, though &s;he knew his honour demanded
the &s;acrifice, &s;he could not lay a&s;ide that regard
and veneration which is attached to the name of
hu&s;band; and therefore re&s;olved to retire into a
mona&s;try, where &s;he could &s;pend the remainder
of her life in devotion, without being expo&s;ed to
any intercour&s;e which might interfere with the
delicacy of her &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.</P>

&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Renaldo and his &s;i&s;ter,
he would not one moment deny him&s;elf the plea|&s;ure

as he under&s;tood the place of her retreat,
and had obtained a proper order to the abbe&s;s,
&s;igned by count Treba&s;i, he &s;et out po&s;t for
Vienna, &s;till accompanied by his faithful Hiber|nian,
and arriving at the convent, found the ab|be&s;s
and the whole hou&s;e &s;o engro&s;&s;ed in mak|ing
preparations for the ceremony of giving the

bridle his impatience for two days, and keep his
<PB N="198" REF="199">
credentials until the hurry &s;hould be over, that
mademoi&s;elle might have no intimation of her
good fortune, except from his own mouth.</P>
<P>In order to fill up this tedious interval, he vi|&s;ited
his friends at court, who were rejoiced to
hear the happy i&s;&s;ue of his excur&s;ion to Pre&s;burg;
the prince who was his particular patron de&s;ired he
would make him&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y with regard to
the death of count Treba&s;i, for he would take
care to repre&s;ent him in &s;uch a light to the em|pre&s;s

or pro&s;ecution on that account. His High|ne&s;s,
moreover, appointed the following day for
performing the promi&s;e he had made of pre&s;ent|ing
him to that augu&s;t prince&s;s, and in the mean
time prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her &s;o much in his favour, that
when he approached her pre&s;ence, and was an|nounced
by his noble introductor, &s;he eyed him
with a look of peculiar complacency, &s;aying,
&startq;I am glad to &s;ee you returned to my domi|nions.
Your father was a gallant officer, who
&s;erved our hou&s;e with equal courage and fidelity;
and as I under&s;tand you tread in his foot-&s;teps,
you may depend upon my favour and protec|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>He was &s;o much overwhelmed with this graci|ous
reception, that, while he bowed in &s;ilence,
the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes;
and her imperial maje&s;ty was &s;o well plea&s;ed with
this manife&s;tation of his heart, that &s;he immedi|ately
gave directions for promoting him to the
command of a troop of hor&s;e.&mdash;Thus fortune
&s;eemed willing and indeed eager to di&s;charge the
debt &s;he owed him for the different calamities he
had undergone. And as he looked upon the ge|nerous
Hebrew to be the &s;ole &s;ource of his &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="199" REF="200">
he did not fail to make him acquainted with
the happy effects of his recommendation and
friend&s;hip, and to expre&s;s, in the warme&s;t terms,
the deep &s;en&s;e he had of his uncommon benevo|lence,
which, by the bye, was &s;till greater with
regard to Renaldo, than the reader as yet ima|gines;
for he not only furni&s;hed him with money
for his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, but al&s;o given him an
unlimited credit on a banker in Vienna to whom
one of his letters was directed.</P>
<P>The ceremony of the nun's admi&s;&s;ion being
now performed, and the convent re&s;tored to its
former quiet, Melvile ha&s;ted thither on the wings
of brotherly affection, and pre&s;ented his letter to
the abbe&s;s, who having peru&s;ed the contents, by
which &s;he learned that the family di&s;quiets of
count Treba&s;i no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and that the
bearer was the brother of mademoi&s;elle, &s;he re|ceived
him with great politene&s;s, congratulated
him on this happy event, and begging he would
excu&s;e her &s;taying with him in the parlour, on
pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s, withdrew, &s;aying, &s;he would
immediately &s;end in a young lady who would con|&s;ole
him for her ab&s;ence. In a few minutes he
was joined by his &s;i&s;ter, who, expecting nothing
le&s;s than to &s;ee Renaldo, no &s;ooner di&s;tingui&s;hed
his features, than &s;he &s;hriek'd aloud with &s;urprize,
and would have &s;unk upon the floor, had not he
&s;upported her in his embrace.</P>
<P>Such a &s;udden apparition of her brother at any
time, or in any place, after their long &s;eparation,
would have &s;trongly affected this &s;en&s;ible young
lady: but to find him &s;o abruptly in a place
where &s;he thought her&s;elf buried from the know|ledge
of all her relations, occa&s;ioned &s;uch com|motion
in her &s;pirits as had well nigh endangered
<PB N="200" REF="201">
her rea&s;on: for it was not 'till after a con&s;idera|ble
pau&s;e, that &s;he could talk to him with con|nexion
or coherence. However, as tho&s;e tran&s;|ports
&s;ub&s;ided, they entered into a more delibe|rate
and agreeable conver&s;ation; in the cour&s;e of
which, he gradually informed her of what had
pa&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle; and inexpre&s;&s;ible was the
plea&s;ure &s;he felt in learning that her mother was
relea&s;ed from captivity, her&s;elf re&s;tored to free|dom,
and her brother to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
lawful inheritance, by the only means to which
&s;he had always prayed the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings might be
owing.</P>
<P>As &s;he had been treated with uncommon hu|manity
by the abbe&s;s, &s;he would not con&s;ent to
leave the convent until he &s;hould be ready to &s;et
out for Pre&s;burg; &s;o that they dined together with
that good lady, and pa&s;&s;ed the afternoon in that
mutual communication with which a brother and
&s;&s;ter may be &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain them&s;elves on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion. She gave him a detail of the
in&s;ults and mortifications &s;he had &s;uffered from the
brutality of her father-in-law, and told him, that
her confinement in this mona&s;try was owing to
Treba&s;i's having intercepted a letter to her from
Renaldo, &s;ignifying his intention to return to the
empire, in order to a&s;&s;ert his own right and redre&s;s
her grievances. Then turning the di&s;cour&s;e upon
the incidents of his peregrinations, &s;he in a par|ticular
manner inquired about that exqui&s;ite beau|ty
who had been the innocent &s;ource of all his
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and upon who&s;e perfections he had often,
in his letters to his &s;i&s;ter, expatiated with in|dications
of rapture and delight.</P>
<P>This inquiry in a moment blew up that &s;corch|ing
flame which had been well nigh &s;tifled by
<PB N="201" REF="202">
other nece&s;&s;ary avocations. H$s eyes gleamed,
his cheeks glowed and grew pale alternately, and
his whole frame underwent an immediate agita|tion;
which being perceived by mademoi&s;elle,
&s;he concluded that &s;ome new calamity was an|nexed
to the name of Monimia, and dreading to
rip up a wound which &s;he &s;aw was &s;o ineffectu|ally
clo&s;ed, &s;he for the pre&s;ent &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her cu|rio&s;ity
and concern, and indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavour|ed
to introduce &s;ome le&s;s affecting &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation.
He &s;aw her aim, approved of her
di&s;cretion, and joining her endeavours, expre&s;&s;ed
his &s;urprize at her having omitted to &s;ignify the
lea&s;t remembrance of her old favourite Fathom,
whom he had left in England. He had no
&s;ooner pronounced this name than &s;he &s;uffered
&s;ome confu&s;ion in her turn; from which, how|ever,
recollecting her&s;elf, &startq;Brother,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;you mu&s;t endeavour to forget that wr$tch, who
is altogether unworthy of retaining the &s;malle&s;t
&s;hare of your regard.&endq;</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed and indeed angry at this expre&s;&s;ion,
which he con&s;idered as the effect of malicious
mi&s;repre&s;entation, he gently chid her for her cre|dulity
in believing the envious a&s;per&s;ion of &s;ome
per&s;on who repined at the &s;uperior virtue of
Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an honour to
the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing is more ea&s;y,&endq; replied the young
lady, &startq;than to impo&s;e upon a per&s;on, who, be|ing
him&s;elf uncon&s;cious of guile, &s;u&s;pects no de|ceit.
You have been a dupe, dear brother, not
to the fine&s;&s;e of Fathom, but to the &s;incerity of
your own heart. For my own part, I a&s;&s;ume no
honour to my own penetration in having compre|hended
the villainy of that impo&s;tor, which was
<PB N="202" REF="203">
di&s;covered in more than one in&s;tance by acci|dents
I could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that Tere&s;a, who attended
me from my childhood, and in who&s;e hone&s;ty I
repo&s;ed &s;uch confidence, having di&s;obliged &s;ome
of the inferior &s;ervants, was &s;o narrowly watched
in all her tran&s;actions, as to be at la&s;t detected
in the very act of conveying a piece of plate,
which was actually found concealed among her
cloaths.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s how much I was a&s;toni&s;hed
when I under&s;tood this circum&s;tance; I could
not tru&s;t to the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es,
and &s;hould have &s;till believed her innocent, in
&s;pite of ocular demon&s;tration, had not &s;he, in
the terrors of being tried for felony, promi&s;ed to
make a very material di&s;covery to the counte&s;s,
provided &s;he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would
&s;ave her life.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t being complied with, &s;he, in my
hearing, opened up &s;uch an amazing &s;cene of ini|quity,
ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude, which had been
acted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud the
family to which they were &s;o much indebted, that
I could not have believed the human mind capa|ble
of &s;uch degeneracy, or that traitor endowed
with &s;uch pernicious cunning and di&s;&s;imulation,
had not her tale been congruous, con&s;i&s;tent and
di&s;tinct, and fraught with circum&s;tances that left
no room to doubt the lea&s;t article of her confe&s;|&s;ion:
on con&s;ideration of which, &s;he was per|mitted
to go into voluntary exile.&endq;</P>
<P>She then explained their combination in all the
particulars, as we have already recounted them
in their proper place; and, finally, ob&s;erved, that
the opinion &s;he had hence conceived of Fathom's
<PB N="203" REF="204">
character, was confirmed by what &s;he had &s;ince
learned of his perfidious conduct towards that
very nun who had lately taken the veil.</P>
<P>Perceiving her brother &s;truck dumb with a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
and gaping with the mo&s;t eager atten|tion,
&s;he proceeded to relate the incidents of his
double intrigue with the jeweller's wife and
daughter, as they were communicated to her by
the nun, who was no other than the individual
Wilhelmina. After tho&s;e rivals had been for|&s;aken
by their gallant, their mutual animo&s;ities
and chagrin &s;erved to whet the attention and in|vention
of each; &s;o that in a little time the whole
my&s;tery &s;tood di&s;clo&s;ed to both. The mother had
di&s;covered the daughter's corre&s;pondence with
Fathom, as we have formerly ob&s;erved, by means
of that unfortunate letter which he unwittingly
committed to the charge of the old beldame; and
as &s;oon as &s;he under&s;tood he was without the
reach of all &s;ollicitation or pro&s;ecution, imparted
this billet to her hu&s;band, who&s;e fury was &s;o un|governable,
that he had almo&s;t &s;acrificed Wilhel|mina
with his own hands, e&s;pecially when terrified
by his threats and imprecations, &s;he owned that
&s;he had be&s;towed the chain on this perfidious
lover. However, his dreadful purpo&s;e was pre|vented,
partly by the interpo&s;ition of his wife,
who&s;e aim was not the death but immurement
of his daughter, and partly by the tears and
&s;upplication of the young gentlewoman her&s;elf,
who prote&s;ted, that, although the ceremony of
the church had not been performed, &s;he was con|tracted
to Fathom by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, to
witne&s;s which, he invoked all the faints in Hea|ven.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">
The jeweller, upon cooler con&s;ideration, was
unwilling to lo&s;e the lea&s;t &s;park of hope that glit|tered
among the ruins of his de&s;pair, and re&s;i&s;ted
all the importunities of his wife, who pre&s;&s;ed him
to con&s;ult the welfare of his daughter's &s;oul, in
the fond expectation of finding &s;ome expedient to
lure back the chain and it's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. In the
mean time Wilhelmina was daily and hourly ex|po&s;ed
to the mortifying animadver&s;ions of her
mamma, who, with all the in&s;olence of virtue,
ince&s;&s;antly upbraided her with the back&s;lidings of
her vicious life, and exhorted her to reformation
and repentance. This continual triumph la&s;ted
for many months, 'till at length a quarrel hap|pening
between the mother and the go&s;&s;ip at
who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he u&s;ed to give the rendezvous to
her admirers, that incen&s;ed confidante, in the
precipitation of her anger, promulgated the hi&s;|tory
of tho&s;e &s;ecret meetings, and, among the
re&s;t, her interviews with Fathom were brought
to light.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t people who hear news of this &s;ort,
are generally tho&s;e to whom they are mo&s;t un|welcome.
The German was &s;oon appri&s;ed of his
wife's frailty, and con&s;idered the two females of
his hou&s;e as a couple of devils incarnate, &s;ent
from hell to exerci&s;e his patience: yet, in the
mid&s;t of his di&s;plea&s;ure he found matter of con|&s;olation,
in being furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficient rea|&s;on
for parting with his help-mate, who had for
many years kept his family in di&s;quiet. He there|fore,
without hazarding a per&s;onal conference,
&s;ent propo&s;als to her by a friend, which &s;he did
not think proper to reject: and &s;eeing him&s;elf re|&s;tored
to the dominion of his own hou&s;e, exerted
<PB N="205" REF="206">
his &s;way &s;o tyrannically, that Wilhelmina became
weary of her life, and had recour&s;e to the com|forts
of religion, of which &s;he &s;oon became ena|moured,
and begged her father's permi&s;&s;ion to
dedicate the $e&s;t of her life to the duties of de|votion.
She was accordingly received in this con|vent;
the regulations of which were &s;o much to
her liking, that &s;he performed the ta&s;k of proba|tion
with plea&s;ure, and voluntarily excluded her|&s;elf
from the vanities of this life. It was here
&s;he had contracted an acquaintance with made|moi&s;elle
de Melvile, to whom &s;he communicated
her complaints of Fathom, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that he was related to the count, as he him&s;elf
had often declared.</P>
<P>While the young lady rehear&s;ed the particu|lars
of this detail, Renaldo &s;u&s;tained a &s;trange
vici&s;&s;itude of different pa&s;&s;ions. Surprize, &s;orrow,
fear, hope and indignation rai&s;ed a mo&s;t tumul|tuous
conflict in his bo&s;om. Monimia ru&s;hed
upon his imagination in the character of inno|$ence
betrayed by the in&s;inuations of treachery.
He with horror viewed her at the mercy of a
villain, who had broken all the ties of gratitude
and honour.</P>
<P>Affrighted at the pro&s;pect, he &s;tarted from his
&s;eat, exclaiming in the unconnected &s;train of di&s;|traction
and de&s;pair: &startq;Have I then nouri&s;hed
a &s;erpent in my bo&s;om! Have I li&s;tened to the
voice of a traitor who hath murdered my peace!
who hath tore my heart-&s;trings a&s;under, and
perhaps ruined the pattern of all earthly perfec|tion.
It cannot be. Heaven would not &s;uffer
&s;uch infernal artifice to take effect. The thun|der
would be levelled again&s;t the head of the ac|cur&s;ed
projector.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
From this tran&s;port, compared with his agita|tion
when &s;he mentioned Monimia, his &s;i&s;ter
judged that Fathom had been the occa&s;ion of a
breach between the two lovers; and this conjec|ture
being confirmed by the disjointed an&s;wers he
made to her interrogations upon the affair, &s;he
endeavoured to calm his apprehen&s;ions, by repre|&s;enting
that he would &s;oon have an opportunity of
returning to England, where the mi&s;under&s;tand|ing
might be ea&s;ily cleared up; and that, in the
mean time, he had nothing to fear on account of
the per&s;on of his mi&s;tre&s;s, in a country where in|dividuals
were &s;o well protected by the laws and
con&s;titution of the realm. At length he &s;uffered
him&s;elf to be flattered with the fond hope of &s;ee|ing
Monimia's character triumph in the inquiry;
of retrieving that lo&s;t jewel, and of renewing
that ravi&s;hing intercour&s;e and exalted expectation
which had been &s;o cruelly cut off. He now
wi&s;hed to find Fathom as black as he had been
exhibited, that Monimia's apo&s;tacy might be
numbered among the mi&s;repre&s;entations of his
treachery and fraud.</P>
<P>His love, which was alike generous and ar|dent,
e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e, and he no longer
doubted her con&s;tancy and virtue: but when he
reflected how her tender heart mu&s;t have been
wrung with angui&s;h at his unkindne&s;s and cruel|ty,
in leaving her de&s;titute in a foreign land; how
her &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t have been tortured in find|ing
her&s;elf altogether dependent upon a ruffian,
who certainly harboured the mo&s;t baleful de&s;igns
upon her honour; how her life mu&s;t be endan|gered
both by his barbarity and her own de&s;pair:
I &s;ay, when he reflected on the&s;e circum&s;tances,
he &s;huddered with horrour and di&s;may; and that
<PB N="207" REF="208">
very night di&s;patched a letter to his friend the
Jew, intreating him, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing man|ner,
to employ all his intelligence in learning the

he &s;oothed him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of an happy

the ca&s;tle to an hou&s;e of his own in Pre&s;burg, but
proffered to make immediate re&s;titution of all the
rents which he had unju&s;tly converted to his own
u&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;ettled in the mo&s;t amica|ble
manner, to the entire &s;atisfaction of the par|ties
concerned, as well as of the neighbouring
noble&s;&s;e, among whom the hou&s;e of Melvile was
in univer&s;al e&s;teem, Renaldo re&s;olved to &s;ollicit
leave at the Imperial court to return to England,
in order to inve&s;tigate that affair of Monimia,
which was more intere&s;ting than all the points he
had hitherto adju&s;ted: but, before he quitted
Pre&s;burg, his friend Farrel taking him a&s;ide one
day, &startq;Count,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;will you give me
leave to a&s;k, if, by my zeal and attachment for
you, I have had the good fortune to acquire your
e&s;teem?&endq; &startq;To doubt that e&s;teem,&endq; replied
Renaldo, &startq;were to &s;u&s;pect my gratitude and
honour, of which I mu&s;t be utterly de&s;titute be|fore
I lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e obligations I owe to
your gallantry and friend&s;hip: obligations which
I long for a proper occa&s;ion to repay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well then,&endq; re&s;umed the major, &startq;I will
deal with you like a downright Swi&s;s, and point
out a method by which you may &s;hift the load
of obligation from your own &s;houlders to mine.
You know my birth, rank and expectations in
the &s;ervice: but perhaps you do not know, that,
as my expence hath always unavoidably exceeded
my income, I find my&s;elf a little out at elbows
in my circum&s;tances, and want to piece them up
by matrimony. Of tho&s;e ladies with whom I
think I have any chance of &s;ucceeding, made|moi&s;elle
<PB N="209" REF="210">
de Melvile &s;eems the be&s;t qualified to
render my &s;ituation happy in all re&s;pects. Her
fortune is more than &s;ufficient to di&s;embarra&s;s my
affairs; her good &s;en&s;e will be a &s;ea&s;onable check
upon my vivacity; her agreeable accompli&s;hments
will engage a continuation of affection and re|gard:
I know my own di&s;po&s;ition well enough to
think I &s;hall become a mo&s;t du$$ful and tractable
hu&s;band; and &s;hall deem my&s;elf highly honoured
in being more clo&s;ely united to my dear count de
Melvile, the &s;on and repre&s;entative of that worthy
officer under whom my youth was formed: if
you will therefore &s;anction my claim, I will
forthwith begin my approaches, and doubt not,
under your au&s;pices, to bring the place to a ca|pitulation.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo was plea&s;ed with the frankne&s;s of this
declaration, approved of his demand, and de&s;ired
him to depend upon his good offices with his &s;i$$er,
whom he &s;ounded, that &s;ame evening, upon the
&s;ubject, recommending the major to her favour,
as a gentleman well worthy of her choice. Ma|demoi&s;elle,
who had never been exerci&s;ed in the
coquetries of her &s;ex, and was now arrived at
tho&s;e years, when the vanity of youth ought to
yield to di&s;cretion, con&s;idered, the propo&s;al as a
philo&s;opher, and after due deliberation, candidly
owned &s;he had no objection to the match. Far|rel
was accordingly introduced in the character of
a lover, after the permi&s;&s;ion of the counte&s;s had
been obtained; and he carried on his addre&s;&s;es in
the u&s;ual form, &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of all
concerned in the event, that a day was appointed
for the celebration of his nuptials, when he en|tered
into peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prize.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
A few days after this joyful occa&s;ion, while
Renaldo was at Vienna, where he had been in|dulged
with leave of ab&s;ence for &s;ix months, and
employed in making preparations for his journey
to Britain, he was one evening pre&s;ented, by his
&s;ervant, with a pacquet from London, which he
no &s;ooner opened, than he found inclo&s;ed a letter
directed to him, in the hand-writing of Monimia.
He was &s;o much affected at &s;ight of tho&s;e well-known
characters, that he &s;tood motionle&s;s as a
&s;tatue, eager to know the contents, yet afraid to
peru&s;e the billet. While he he&s;itated in this &s;u&s;|pence,
he chanced to ca&s;t his eye on the in&s;ide of
the cover, and perceived the name of his Jewi&s;h
friend at the bottom of a few lines, importing,
that the inclo&s;ed was delivered to him by a phy&s;i|cian
of his acquaintance, who had recommended
it in a particular manner to his care. This inti|mation
&s;erved only to encrea&s;e the my&s;tery, and
whet his impatience; and as he had the explana|tion
in his hand, he &s;ummoned all his re&s;olution
to his aid, and breaking the &s;eal, began to read
the&s;e words, &startq;Renaldo will not &s;uppo&s;e, that
this addre&s;s proceeds from intere&s;ted motives,
when he learns, that, before it can be pre&s;ented
to his view, the unfortunate Monimia will be no
more.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the light for&s;ook Renaldo's eyes, his
knees knocked together, and he fell at full length
in&s;en&s;ible on the floor: his valet hearing the
noi&s;e, ran into the apartment, lifted him upon a
couch, and di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger for proper a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
while he him&s;elf endeavoured to recal his
&s;pirits by &s;uch applications as chance afforded:
but before the count exhibited any &s;igns of life,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
his brother-in-law entered his chamber by acci|dent,
and as &s;oon as he recollected him&s;elf from
the extreme confu&s;ion and concern produced by
this melancholy &s;pectacle, he perceived the fatal
epi&s;tle which Melvile, though in&s;en&s;ible, &s;till kept
within his gra&s;p; ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pecting this to be the
cau&s;e of that &s;evere paroxy&s;m, he drew near the
couch, and with difficulty read what is above re|hear&s;ed,
and the &s;equel, to this effect.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, I have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as will pre|vent
it from falling into your hands, until after I
&s;hall have been relea&s;ed from a being imbittered
with inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery and angui&s;h. It is
not my intention, once loved, and ah! &s;till too
fondly remembered youth, to upbraid you as the
&s;ource of that uncea&s;ing woe, which hath been &s;o
long the &s;ole inhabitant of my lonely bo&s;om. I
will not call you incon&s;tant or unkind. I dare
not think you ba&s;e or di&s;honourable; yet I was
abruptly &s;acrificed to a triumphant rival, before I
had learned to bear &s;uch mortification; before I
had overcome the prejudices which I had imbibed
in my father's hou&s;e. I was all at once abandon|ed
to de&s;pair, to indigence and di&s;tre&s;s, to the vile
practices of a villain, who, I fear, hath betrayed
us both. What have not I &s;uffered from the in|&s;ults
and vicious de&s;igns of that wretch, whom you
cheri&s;hed in your bo&s;om! yet to the&s;e I owe this
near approach to that goal of peace, where the
canker-worm of &s;orrow will expire. Beware of
that artful traitor; and, oh! endeavour to over|come
that levity of di&s;po&s;ition, which, if indulged,
will not only &s;tain your reputation, but al&s;o de|bauch
the good qualities of your heart. I relea&s;e
you, in the &s;ight of heaven, from all obligations:
if I have been injured, let not my wrongs be vi|&s;ited
<PB N="212" REF="213">
on the head of Renaldo, for whom &s;hall be
offered up the la&s;t &s;ervent prayers of the haple&s;s
Monimia.&endq;</P>
<P>This letter was a clue to the labyrinth of Mel|vile's
di&s;tre&s;s: though the major had never heard
him mention the name of this beauty, he had re|ceived
&s;uch hints from his own wife, as enabled
him to comprehend the whole of the count's di&s;|a&s;ter.
By the admini&s;tration of &s;timulating me|dicines,
Renaldo recovered his perception: but
this was a cruel alternative, con&s;idering the &s;itua|tion
of his thoughts. The fir&s;t word he pronounced
was Monimia, with all the empha&s;is of the mo&s;t
violent de&s;pair: he peru&s;ed the letter, and poured
forth incoherent execrations again&s;t Fathom and
him&s;elf. He exclaimed in a frantic tone, &startq;&s;he is
lo&s;t for ever! murthered by my unkindne&s;s! we
are both undone by the infernal arts of Fathom!
execrable mon&s;ter! Re&s;tore her to my arms. If
thou art not a fiend in reality, I will tear out thy
fal&s;e heart!&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;prung upon his valet, who would
have fallen a &s;acrifice to his undi&s;tingui&s;hing fury,
had not he been &s;aved by the interpo&s;ition of Farrel
and the family, who di&s;engaged him from his ma|&s;ter's
gripe by dint of force; yet, notwith&s;tanding
their joint endeavours, he broke from this re|&s;traint,
leaped upon the floor, and &s;eizing his
&s;word, attempted to plunge it in his own brea&s;t.
When he was once more overcome by numbers,
he cur&s;ed him&s;elf, and all tho&s;e who withheld him;
&s;wore he would not &s;urvive the fair victim who
had peri&s;hed by his credulity and indi&s;cretion; and
the agitation of his &s;pirits increa&s;ed to &s;uch a de|gree,
that he was &s;eized with &s;trong convul&s;ions,
which nature was &s;carce able to &s;u&s;tain: every
<PB N="213" REF="214">
medical expedient was u&s;ed to quiet this perturba|tion,
which at length yielded &s;o far as to &s;ub&s;ide
into a continual &s;ever, and confirmed delirium,
during which he cea&s;ed not to pour forth the mo&s;t
pathetic complaints touching his ruined love, and
to rave about the ill-&s;tarred Monimia. The ma|jor,
half di&s;tracted by the calamity of his friend,
would have concealed it from the knowledge of
his family, had not the phy&s;ician, by de&s;pairing
of his life, laid him under the nece&s;&s;ity of making
them acquainted with his condition.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s and mrs. Farrel were no &s;ooner
informed of his ca&s;e, than they ha&s;ted to the me|lancholy
&s;cene, where they found Renaldo de|prived
of his &s;en&s;es, panting under the rage of an
exa&s;perated di&s;ea&s;e. They &s;aw his face di&s;torted,
and his eyes glaring with frenzy: they heard him
invoke the name of Monimia, with a tenderne&s;s
of accent, which even the impul&s;e of madne&s;s
could not de&s;troy. Then with a &s;udden tran&s;i|tion
of tone and ge&s;ture, he denounced vengeance
again&s;t her betrayer, and called upon the north
wind to cool the fervour of his brain. His hair
hung in di&s;hevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan,
his looks gha&s;tly, his vigour was fled, and all the
glory of his youth faded: the phy&s;ician hung his
head in &s;ilence, the attendants wrung their hands
in de&s;pair, and the countenance of his friend was
bathed in tears.</P>
<P>Such a picture would have moved the mo&s;t ob|durate
heart: what impre&s;&s;ion then mu&s;t it have
made upon a parent and &s;i&s;ter, melting with all the
enthu&s;ia&s;m of affection! The mother was &s;truck
dumb, and &s;tupified with grief: the &s;i&s;ter threw
her&s;elf on the bed, in a tran&s;port of &s;orrow,
caught her loved Renaldo in her arms, and was,
<PB N="214" REF="215">
with great difficulty, tore from his embrace. Such
was the di&s;mal rever&s;e that overtook the late &s;o
happy family of Melvile: &s;uch was the extremity
to which the treachery of Fathom had reduced
his be&s;t benefactor!</P>
<P>Three days did nature &s;truggle with &s;urpri&s;ing
efforts, and then the con&s;titution &s;eemed to &s;ink
under the victorious &s;ever; yet, as his &s;trength
dimini&s;hed, his delirium abated, and on the fifth
morning he looked round, and recognized his
weeping friends. Though now exhau&s;ted to the
lowe&s;t ebb of life, he retained the perfect u&s;e of
&s;peech, and his rea&s;on being quite unclouded,
&s;poke to each with equal kindne&s;s and compo&s;ure:
he congratulated him&s;elf upon the &s;ight of &s;hore,
after the horrors of &s;uch a tempe&s;t; called upon
the counte&s;s and his &s;i&s;ter, who were not permited
to &s;ee him at &s;uch a conjuncture, and being ap|prized
by the major, of his rea&s;on for excluding
them from her pre&s;ence, he applauded his con|cern,
bequeathed them to his future care, and
took leave of that gentleman with a cordial em|brace.
Then he de&s;ired to be left in private with
a certain clergyman, who regulated the concerns
of his &s;oul; and he being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, turned his
face from the light, in expectation of his final
di&s;charge: in a few minutes all was &s;till and
dreary; he was no longer heard to breathe, no
more the &s;tream of life was perceived to circu|late;
he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be ab&s;olved from all his
cares, and an univer&s;al groan from the by-&s;tanders
anounced the decea&s;e of the gallant, generous,
and tender-hearted Renaldo.</P>
<P>&startq;Come hither ye whom the pride of youth and
health, of birth and affluence inflames, who tread
the flowery maze of plea&s;ure, tru&s;ting to the
<PB N="215" REF="216">
fruition of ever-circling joys: ye who glory in
your accompli&s;hments, who indulge the views of
ambition, and lay &s;chemes for future happine&s;s
and grandeur; contemplate here the vanity of
life: behold how low this excellent young man is
laid! mowed down even in the blo&s;&s;om of his
youth, when fortune &s;eemed to open all her trea|&s;ures
to his worth!&endq;</P>
<P>Such were the reflections of the generous Far|rel,
who, while he performed the la&s;t office of
friend&s;hip, in clo&s;ing the eyes of the much-lamented
Melvile, perceived a warmth on the &s;kin, which
the hand of death &s;eldom leaves unextingui&s;hed:
this uncommon &s;en&s;ation he reported to the phy|&s;ician,
who, though he could feel no pul&s;ation in
the heart or arteries, conjectured, that life &s;till
lingered in &s;ome of its interior haunts, and imme|diately
ordered &s;uch applications to the extremi|ties
and &s;urface of the body, as might help to con|centrate
and reinforce the natural heat.</P>
<P>By the&s;e pre&s;criptions, which, for &s;ome time,
produced no &s;en&s;ible effect, the embers were, in
all probability, kept glowing, and the vital power
revived; for, after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, re&s;pira|tion
was gradually renewed at long intervals, a
languid motion was perceived at the heart, a few
feeble and irregular pul&s;ations were felt at the
wri&s;t; the clay-coloured livery of death began to
vani&s;h from his face; the circulation acquired
new force, and he opened his eyes with a &s;igh,
which proclaimed his return from the &s;hades of
death.</P>
<P>When he recovered the faculty of &s;wallowing,
a cordial was admini&s;tered; and whether the fe|ver
abated, in con&s;equence of the blood's being
cooled and conden&s;ed during the rece&s;s of action
<PB N="216" REF="217">
in the &s;olids, or nature, in that agony, had pre|pared
a proper channel for the expul&s;ion of the
di&s;ea&s;e; certain it is, he was, from this moment,
rid of all bodily pain, he retrieved the animal
functions, and nothing remained of his malady
but an extreme weakne&s;s and languor, the effect
of nature's being fatigued in the battle &s;he had
won.</P>
<P>Unutterable was the joy that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his mother and &s;i&s;ter, when Farrel flew into their
apartment, to intimate this happy turn. Scarce
could they be re&s;trained from pouring forth their
tran&s;ports in the pre&s;ence of Renaldo, who was
&s;till too feeble to endure &s;uch communication:
indeed he was extremely mortified and dejected
at this event, which had diffu&s;ed &s;uch plea&s;ure and
&s;atisfaction among his friends; for though his di|&s;temper
was ma&s;tered, the fatal cau&s;e of it &s;till
rankled at his heart, and he con&s;idered this re|&s;pite
from death as a protraction of his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>When he was congratulated by the major, on
the triumph of his con&s;titution, he replied, with a
groan, &startq;I would to heaven it had been other|wi&s;e;
for I am re&s;erved for all the horrors of the
mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow and remor&s;e. O Moni|mia!
Monimia! I hoped, by this time, to have
convinced thy gentle &s;hade, that I was, at lea&s;t
intentionally, innocent of that ruthle&s;s barbarity
which hath brought thee to an untimely grave.
Heaven and earth! do I &s;till &s;urvive the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of that dire cata&s;trophe! and lives the
atrocious villain who hath bla&s;ted all our hopes!&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e la&s;t words, the fire darted from his
eyes, and his brother, &s;natching this occa&s;ional
handle for reconciling him to life, joined in his
exclamations again&s;t the treacherous Fathom, and
<PB N="217" REF="218">
ob&s;erved, that he &s;hould not, in point of honour,
wi&s;h to die, until he &s;hould have &s;acrificed that
traitor to the manes of the beauteous Monimia.
This incitement acted as a &s;pur upon exhau&s;ted
nature, cau&s;ing the blood to circulate with fre&s;h
vigour, and encouraging him to take &s;uch &s;u&s;te|nance
as would recruit his &s;trength, and repair
the damage which his health had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended him in his reco|very,
flattering his appetite, and amu&s;ing his &s;or|row
at the &s;ame time; the clergyman a&s;&s;ailed his
de&s;pondence with religious weapons, as well as
with arguments drawn from philo&s;ophy; and the
fury of his pa&s;&s;ions being already expended, he
became &s;o tractable as to li&s;ten to his remon|&s;t$ances:
but notwith&s;tanding the joint endea|vours
of all his friends, a deep-fixed melancholy
remained, after every con&s;equence of his di&s;ea&s;e
had vani&s;hed: in vain they a&s;&s;ayed to elude his
grief by g$iety and diver&s;ions; in vain they
tried to decoy his heart into &s;ome new engage|ment.</P>
<P>The&s;e kind attempts &s;erved only to feed and
nouri&s;h that melancholy which-pined within his
bo&s;om. Monimia &s;till haunted him in the mid&s;t
of the&s;e amu&s;ements, while his reflection whi&s;per|ed
to him, &startq;Plea&s;ures like the&s;e I might have
reli&s;hed with her participation.&endq; That darling
idea mingled in all the female a&s;&s;emblies at which
he was pre&s;ent, eclip&s;ing their attractions, and
inhancing the bitterne&s;s of his lo&s;s; for ab&s;ence,
enthu&s;ia&s;m, and even his de&s;pair had heightened
the charms of the fair orphan into &s;omething &s;u|pernatural
and divine.</P>
<P>Time, that commonly weakens $he traces of
remembrance, &s;eemed to deepen its impre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="218" REF="219">
in his brea&s;t: nightly, in his dreams, did he con|ver&s;e
with his dear Monimia: &s;ometimes on the
verdant bank of a delightful &s;tream, where he
breathed, in &s;oft murmurs, the dictates of his love
and admiration: &s;ometimes reclined within the
tufted grove, his arm encircled and &s;u&s;tained her
&s;nowy neck, whil&s;t &s;he, with looks of love ineffa|ble,
gazed on his face, invoking heaven to ble&s;s
her hu&s;band and her lord: yet, even in the&s;e illu|&s;ions,
was his fancy oft alarmed for the ill-fated
fair: &s;ometimes he viewed her tottering on the
brink of a &s;teep precipice, far di&s;tant from his
helping hand: at other times &s;he &s;eemed to &s;ail
along the boi&s;terous tide, imploring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance:
then would he &s;tart with horror from his &s;leep,
and feel his &s;orrows more than realized: he de|&s;erted
his couch: he avoided the &s;ociety of man|kind:
he courted &s;eque&s;tered &s;hades, where he
could indulge his melancholy; there his mind
brooded over his calamity, until his imagination
became familiar with all the ravages of death: it
contemplated the gradual decline of Monimia's
health; her tears, her di&s;tre&s;s, her de&s;pair at his
imagined cruelty; he &s;aw thro' that per&s;pective,
every blo&s;&s;om of her beauty wither, every &s;par|kle
vani&s;h from her eyes: he beheld her faded
lips, her pale cheek, and her inanimated features,
the &s;ymmetry of which, not death it&s;elf was able
to de&s;troy. His fancy conveyed her breathle&s;s
cor&s;e to the cold grave, o'er which, perhaps, no
tear humane was &s;hed, where her delicate limbs
were con&s;igned to du&s;t, where &s;he was di&s;hed out
a delicious banquet to the un&s;paring worm.</P>
<P>O'er the&s;e pictures he dwelt with a &s;ort of
plea&s;ing angui&s;h, until he became &s;o enamoured
of her tomb, that he could no longer re&s;i&s;t the
<PB N="219" REF="220">
de&s;ire which compelled him to make a pilgrimage
to the dear hallowed &s;pot, where all his once gay
hopes lay buried; that he might nightly vi&s;it the
&s;ilent habitation of his ruined love, embrace the
&s;acred earth with which &s;he was now compound|ed,
moi&s;ten it with his tears, and bid the turf lie
ea&s;y on her brea&s;t. Be&s;ides the pro&s;pect of this
gloomy enjoyment, he was urged to return to
England, by an eager de&s;ire of taking vengeance
on the perfidious Fathom, as well as of acquitting
him&s;elf of the obligations he owed in that king|dom,
to tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his di&s;tre&s;s.
He therefore communicated his intention to Far|rel,
who would have in&s;i&s;ted upon attending him
in the journey, had not he been conjured to &s;tay
and manage Renaldo's affairs in his ab&s;ence. E|very
previous &s;tep being taken, he took leave of
the counte&s;s and his &s;i&s;ter, who had, with all
their intere&s;t and elocution, oppo&s;ed his de&s;ign,
the execution of which, they ju&s;tly feared, would,
in&s;tead of di&s;&s;ipating, augment his chagrin; and
now, &s;eeing him determined, they &s;hed a flood of
tears at his departure, and he &s;et out from Vienna
in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, accompanied by a tru&s;ty valet de

making all the proper di&s;po&s;itions, and ad|ju&s;ting
every nece&s;&s;ary article on the road, Renal|do
totally ab&s;tracted him&s;elf from earthly con&s;ide|rations,
<PB N="220" REF="221">
and mu&s;ed without cea&s;ing on that theme
which was the con&s;tant &s;ubject of his contempla|tion.
He was blind to the objects that &s;urrounded
him; he &s;carce ever felt the importunities of na|ture;
and had not they been reinforced by the
pre&s;&s;ing entreaties of his attendant, he would
have proceeded without refre&s;hment or repo&s;e.
In this ab&s;ence of mind did he traver&s;e a great
part of Germany, in his way to the Au&s;trian Ne|therlands,
and arrived at the fortre&s;s of Luxem|burg,
where he was obliged to tarry a whole day
on account of an accident which had happened to
his chai&s;e. Here he went to view the fortifica|tions;
and as he walked along the ramparts, his
ears were &s;aluted with the&s;e words, &startq;H$aven
ble&s;s the noble count de Melvile! will not he turn
the eyes of compa&s;&s;ion upon an old fellow-&s;oldier
reduced to misfortune and di&s;grace?&endq;</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed at this addre&s;s, which was attended
with the clanking of chains, Renaldo lifted up
his eyes, and perceived the per&s;on who &s;poke, to
be one of two malefactors &s;hackled together, who
had been &s;entenced for &s;ome crime to work as
labourers on the fortifications: his face was &s;o
covered with hair, and his whole appearance &s;o
di&s;gui&s;ed by the &s;qualid habit which he wore, that
the count could not recollect his features, until he
gave him to under&s;tand that his name was Ratch|kali.
Melvile immediately recognized his fellow
&s;tudent at Vienna and his brother volunteer upon
the Rhine, and expre&s;&s;ed equal &s;urprize and con|cern
at &s;eeing him in &s;uch a deplorable &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>Nothing renders the &s;oul, &s;o callous and in&s;en&s;i|ble
as the fearing brands of infamy and di&s;grace.
Without betraying the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of $ha$e or
confu&s;ion, &startq;Count,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;this is the
<PB N="221" REF="222">
fate of war, at lea&s;t of the war in which I have
been engaged, ever &s;ince I took leave of the im|perial
army, and retreated with your old compa|nion
Fathom. Long life to that original genius!
If he is not unhapplily eclip&s;ed by &s;ome unfortu|nate
interpo&s;ition, before his terrence parts are
purified, I fore&s;ee that he will &s;hine a &s;tar of the
fir&s;t magnitude in the world of adventure.&endq;</P>
<P>At mention of this dete&s;ted name, Renaldo's
heart began to throb wi$h indignation; yet he
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed the emotion, and de&s;ired to know the
meaning of that &s;plendid encomium which he
had be&s;towed upon his confederate. &startq;It would be
quite unnece&s;&s;ary,&endq; replied Ratchkali, &startq;for a
man in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation to equivocate or di&s;|gui&s;e
the truth: the nature of my di&s;grace is per|fectly
well known. I am condemned to hard la|bour
for life; and unle&s;s &s;ome lucky accident
(which I cannot now fore&s;ee) &s;hall intervene, all
I can expect is &s;ome alleviation of my hard lot
from the genero&s;ity of &s;uch gentlemen as you who
compa&s;&s;ionate the &s;ufferings of your fellow crea|tures.
In order to engage this benevolence the
more in my behalf, I &s;hall (if you will give me
the hearing) faithfully inform you of &s;ome parti|culars,
which it may import you to know, con|cerning
my old acquaintance Ferdinand Count
Fathom, who&s;e real character hath perhaps hi|therto
e&s;caped your notice.&endq;</P>
<P>Then he proceeded to give a regular detail of
all the &s;trokes of fine&s;&s;e which he, in conjunction
with our adventurer, had practi&s;ed upon Melvile
and others, during their re&s;idence at Vienna, and
the campaigns they had made upon the Rhine:
he explained the nature of the robbery which
was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been done by the count's
<PB N="222" REF="223">
valet, together with the manner of their de&s;er|tion:
he de&s;cribed his &s;eparation from Fathom,
their meeting at London, the traffic they carried
on in copartner&s;hip; and the misfortune that re|duced
Ferdinand to the condition in which he was
found by Melvile.</P>
<P>&startq;After having gratified the hone&s;t lawyer,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;with a &s;hare of the unfortunate Fa|thom's
&s;poils, and packed up all my own valuable
effects, my new auxiliary Maurice and I po&s;ted
to Harwich, embarked in the pacquet-boat, and
next day arrived at Helveot&s;luys; from thence
we repaired to the Hague, in order to mingle in
the gaities of the place, and exerci&s;e our talents
at play, which is there cultivated with univer&s;al
eagerne&s;s: but, chancing to meet with an old ac|quaintance,
whom I did not at all de&s;ire to &s;ee,
I found it convenient to withdraw &s;oftly to Rot|terdam;
from whence we &s;et out for Antwerp;
and having made a tour of the Au&s;trian Nether|lands,
&s;et up our re&s;t at Bru&s;&s;els, and concerted
a plan for laying the Flemings under contribu|tion.</P>
<P>From our appearance we procured admi&s;&s;ion
into the mo&s;t polite a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;ucceeded to a
wonder in all our operations; until our career
was unfortunately checked by the indi&s;cretion of
my ally, who, being detected in the very act of
conveying a card, was immediately introduced
to a magi&s;trate; and this mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice was
&s;o curious, inqui&s;itive, and clear-&s;ighted, that
count Maurice, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to elude his
penetration, was &s;ain to &s;tipulate for his own
&s;afety, by giving up his friend to the cognizance of
the law. I was accordingly apprehended, before
I knew the cau&s;e of my arre&s;t; and being unhap|pily
<PB N="223" REF="224">
known by &s;ome &s;oldiers of the prince's guard,
my character turned out &s;o little to the approba|tion
of the inqui&s;itors, that all my effects were
confi&s;cated for the benefit of the &s;tate, and I was
by a formal &s;entence condemned to labour on the
fortifications all the days of my life; while Mau|rice
e&s;caped at the expence of five hundred &s;tripes,
which he received in public from the hands of the
common executioner.</P>
<P>Thus have I, without eva&s;ion or mental re|&s;ervation,
given a faithful account of the &s;teps by
which I have arrived at this barrier, which is like|ly
to be the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of my peregrinations,
unle&s;s the generous count de Melvile will deign
to interpo&s;e his intere&s;t in behalf of an old fellow-&s;oldier,
who may yet live to ju&s;tify his media|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo had no rea&s;on to doubt the truth of
this &s;tory, every circum&s;tance of which tend|ed
to corroborate the intelligence he had already
received touching the character of Fathom,
whom he now con&s;idered with a double portion
of abhorrence, as the mo&s;t abandoned mi&s;creant
that nature had ever produced. Tho' Ratchkali
did not po&s;&s;e&s;s a much higher place in his opini|on,
he favoured him with marks of his bounty,
and exhorted him, if po&s;&s;ible, to reform his heart;
but he would by no means promi&s;e to interpo&s;e his
credit in favour of a wretch &s;elf-convicted of &s;uch
enormous villany and fraud. He could not help
moralizing upon this rencounter, which in&s;pired
him with great contempt for human nature: and
next day he proceeded on his journey with a
heavy heart, ruminating on the perfidy of man|kind,
and, between whiles, tran&s;ported with the
<PB N="224" REF="225">
pro&s;pect of revenging all his calamities upon the
accur&s;ed author.</P>
<P>While he was wrapped up in the&s;e reveries,
his carriage rolled along, and had already entered
a wood between Mons and Tournay, when his
dream was &s;uddenly interrupted by the explo&s;ion
of &s;everal pi&s;tols that were fired among the thic|kets
at a little di&s;tance from the road. Rou&s;ed
at this alarm, he &s;natched his &s;word that &s;tood by
him, and &s;pringing from the chai&s;e, ran directly
towards the &s;pot, being clo&s;e followed by his va|let,
who had alighted and armed him&s;elf with a
pi&s;tol in each hand. About forty yards from the
high way they arrived in a little glade or open|ing,
where they &s;aw a &s;ingle man &s;tanding at bay
again&s;t five banditti, after having killed one of
their companions, and lo&s;t his own hor&s;e that lay
dead upon the ground.</P>
<P>Melvile &s;eeing this odds, and immediately
gue&s;&s;ing their de&s;ign, ru&s;hed among them without
he&s;itation, and in an in&s;tant ran his &s;word thro'
the heart of one who&s;e hand was rai&s;ed to &s;mite
the gentleman behind, while he was engaged with
the re&s;t in front. At the &s;ame time the valet
di&s;abled another by a &s;hot in the &s;houlder; &s;o that
the number being now equal on both &s;ides, a fu|rious
combat en&s;ued, every man being paired
with an antagoni&s;t, and each having recour&s;e to
&s;words, as all their pieces had been di&s;charged.
Renaldo's adver&s;ary finding him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed with
equal fury and &s;kill, retreated gradually among
the trees, until he vani&s;hed altogether into the
thicke&s;t of the wood; and his two companions
followed his example with great ea&s;e, the valet
de chambre being hurt in the leg, and the &s;tranger
<PB N="225" REF="226">
&s;o much exhau&s;ted by the wounds he had received
before Renaldo's interpo&s;ition, that when the
young gentleman approached to congratulate him
on the defeat of the robbers, he, in advancing to
embrace his deliverer, dropt down motionle&s;s on
the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The count, with that warmth of &s;ympathy and
benevolence which was natural to his heart, lifted
up the wounded cavalier in his arms, and carried
him to the chai&s;e, in which he was depo&s;ited,
while the valet de chambre reloaded his pi&s;tols,
and prepared for a &s;econd attack, as they did not
doubt that the banditti would return with a rein|forcement.
However, before they re-appeared, Re|naldo's
driver di&s;engaged him from the wood, and
in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour they arrived at
a village, where they halted for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the
&s;tranger, who, tho' &s;till alive, had not recovered
the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>After he was undre&s;&s;ed and laid in a warm bed,
a &s;urgeon examined his body, and found a wound
in his neck by a &s;word, and another in his right
&s;ide occa&s;ioned by a pi&s;tol-&s;hot; &s;o that his prog|no&s;tic
was very dubious: mean while, he applied
proper dre&s;&s;ings to both; and, in half an hour
after this admini&s;tration, the gen$leman gave &s;ome
tokens of perception. He looked around him
with a wildne&s;s of fury in his a&s;pect, as if he had
thought him&s;elf in the hands of the robbers by
whom he had been attacked: but, when he &s;aw
the a&s;&s;iduity with which the by &s;tanders exerted
them&s;elves in his behalf; one rai&s;ing his head from
the pillow, while another exhorted him to &s;wal|low
a little wine which was warmed for the pur|po&s;e;
when he beheld the &s;ympathi&s;ing looks of
all pre&s;ent, and heard him&s;elf acco&s;ted in the
<PB N="226" REF="227">
mo&s;t cordial terms by the per&s;on whom he recol|lected
as his deliverer; all the &s;everity vani&s;hed
from his countenance; he took Renaldo's hand
and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips; and while the tears
gu&s;hed from his eyes, &startq;Prai&s;ed be God,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;that virtue and genero&s;ity are &s;till to be
found among the &s;ons of men.&endq;</P>
<P>Every body in the apartment was affected by
this exclamation; and Melvile, above all the re&s;t,
felt &s;uch emotions as he could &s;carcely re&s;train.
He intreated the gentleman to believe him&s;elf
in the mid&s;t of &s;uch friends as would effectually
&s;ecure him from all violence and mortification;
he conjured him to compo&s;e the perturbation of
his &s;pirits, and quiet the apprehen&s;ions of his
mind with that reflection; and prote&s;ted, that he
him&s;elf would not quit the hou&s;e while his at|tendance
&s;hould be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the
&s;tranger's cure, or his conver&s;ation conducive to
his amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;urances, con&s;idered with the heroic
part which the young Hungarian had already acted
in his behalf, in&s;pired the cavalier with &s;uch a &s;ub|lime
idea of Melvile, that he gazed upon him with
&s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, as an angel &s;ent from heaven
for his &s;uccour; and in the tran&s;port of his gra|titude,
could not help exclaiming, &startq;Sure Pro|vidence
hath &s;till &s;omething in re&s;erve for this
unfortunate wretch, in who&s;e favour &s;uch a
miracle of courage and genero&s;ity hath inter|po&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>Being accommodated with proper care and at|tendance,
his con&s;titution in a little time over|came
the fever; and at the third dre&s;&s;ing, the
&s;urgeon declared him out of all danger from his
wounds. Then was Renaldo indulged with op|portunities
<PB N="227" REF="228">
of conver&s;ing with the patient, and of
inquiring into the particulars of his fortune and
de&s;igns in life, with a view to manife&s;t the incli|nation
he felt to &s;erve him in his future occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The more this &s;tranger contemplated the cha|racter
of the count, the more his amazement in|crea&s;ed,
on account of his extraordinary benevo|lence
in favour of a per&s;on who&s;e merit he could
not po&s;&s;ibly know; he even expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize
on this &s;ubject to Renaldo, who at length told
him, that, altho' his be&s;t offices &s;hould always
be ready for the occa&s;ions of any gentleman in
di&s;tre&s;s, his particular attachment and regard to
him was improved by an additional con&s;idera|tion:
&startq;I am no &s;tranger,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;to the
virtues and honour of the gallant Don Diego de
Zelos.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Heaven and earth!&endq; cried the &s;tranger,
&s;tarting from his &s;eat with extreme emotion, &startq;do
I then live to hear my&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed by that long
lo&s;t appellation! my heart glows at the expre&s;&s;i|on!
my &s;pirits are kindled with a flame that
thrills thro' every nerve! Say, young gentleman,
if you are really an inhabitant of earth, by what
means are you acquainted with the unhappy name
of Zelos?&endq;</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this eager interrogation, Renaldo
gave him to under&s;tand, that in the cour&s;e of his
travels, he had re&s;ided a &s;hort time at Seville,
where he had frequently &s;een Don Diego, and
often heard his character mentioned with uncom|mon
e&s;teem and veneration. &startq;Alas!&endq; replied the
Ca&s;tilian, &startq;that ju&s;tice is no longer done to the
wretched Zelos; his honours are bla&s;ted, and his
<PB N="228" REF="229">
reputation canker-bitten by the venomous tooth
of flander.&endq;</P>
<P>He then proceeded to unfold his misfortunes,
as they have already been explained in the fir&s;t
volume of the&s;e memoirs; at the recapitulation of
which, the heart of Melvile being intendered
by his own calamities, was &s;o deeply affected,
that he re-echoed the groans of don Diego,
and wept over his &s;ufferings with the mo&s;t filial
&s;ympathy. When he repeated the &s;tory of that
cruel fraud, which was practi&s;ed upon him by the
faithle&s;s Fadini, Melvile, who&s;e mind and imagi|nation
teemed with the villanies of Fathom, was
immediately &s;truck with the conjecture of his be|ing
the knave; becau&s;e, indeed, he could not be|lieve,
that any other per&s;on was &s;o abandoned, by
principle and humanity, as to take &s;uch a bar|barous
advantage of a gentleman in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="62" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His return to England, and midnight pilgrimage to
Monimia's tomb.</HEAD>
<P>HE con&s;idered the date of that unparalelled
tran&s;action, which agreed with his con|jecture,
and from the inquiries he made concern|ing
the per&s;on of the traitor, gathered rea&s;ons &s;uf|ficient
to confirm his &s;uppo&s;ition. Thus certified,
&startq;That is the villain, cried the count, who&s;e in|fernal
arts have overwhelmed me with &s;uch mi|&s;ery
as heaven it&s;elf hath no remedy to di&s;pel! To
revenge my wrongs on that perfidious mi&s;creant,
is one of the chief rea&s;ons for which I deign
to drag about an hateful being. O don Diego!
what is life, when all its enjoyments are &s;o ea&s;ily
<PB N="229" REF="230">
poi&s;oned by the machinations of &s;uch a worm!&endq;
So &s;aying, he &s;mote his brea&s;t in all the agony of
woe, and be&s;ought the Spaniard to relate the &s;teps
he took in con&s;equence of this di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tilian's cheeks reddened at this in|formation,
which reinforced his own re&s;entment,
and ca&s;ting up his eyes to heaven, &startq;Sacred pow|ers!
(cried he) let him not peri&s;h, before you
bring him within my reach. You a&s;k me, noble
cavalier, what mea&s;ures I took in this aby&s;s of mi|&s;ery.
For the fir&s;t day, I was tortured with ap|prehen&s;ions
for the friendly Fadini, fearing that
he had been robbed and murthered for the jewels
which he had, perhaps, too unwarily expo&s;ed to
&s;ale: but this terror &s;oon vani&s;hed before the true
pre&s;ages of my fate; when, on the morrow, I
found the whole family in tears and confu&s;ion,
and heard my landlord pour forth the mo&s;t bitter
imprecations again&s;t the fugitive who had deflow|ered
his daughter, and even robbed the hou&s;e.
You will a&s;k, which of the pa&s;&s;ions of my heart
were intere&s;ted on this occa&s;ion; they were &s;hame
and indignation: all my grief flowed in another
channel: I blu&s;hed to find my judgment de|ceived:
I &s;corned to complain; but in my heart
denounced vengeance again&s;t my ba&s;e betrayer.
I &s;ilently retired to my apartment, in order to
commune with my own thoughts.</P>
<P>I had bore greater calamities, without being
driven to de&s;pair: I &s;ummoned all my fortitude to
my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and re&s;olved to live in &s;pite of af|fliction.
Thus determined, I betook my&s;elf to the
hou&s;e of a general officer, who&s;e character was
fair in the world; and having obtained admi&s;&s;ion
in con&s;equence of my oriental appearance; &startq;To
a man of honour, &s;aid I, the unfortunate need
<PB N="230" REF="231">
no introduction: my habit proclaims me a Per|&s;ian;
this pa&s;&s;port from the States of Holland will
confirm that &s;uppo&s;ition. I have been robbed of
jewels, to a con&s;iderable value, by a wretch whom
I favoured with my confidence; and now, re|duced
to extreme indigence, I come to offer my|&s;elf
as a &s;oldier in the armies of France. I have
health and &s;trength &s;ufficient to di&s;charge that du|ty:
nor am I unacquainted with a military life,
which was once my glory and occupation. I
therefore &s;ue for your protection, that I may be
received, though in the lowe&s;t order of them that
&s;erve the king; and that your future favour may
depend upon my behaviour in that capacity.&endq;</P>
<P>The general, &s;urprized at my declaration, &s;ur|veyed
me with uncommon attention; he peru&s;ed
my certificate, a&s;ked divers que&s;tions concerning
the art of war, to which I returned &s;uch an&s;wers
as convinced him that I was not wholly ignorant
in that particular. In &s;hort, I was inli&s;ted as a
volunteer in his own regiment, and &s;oon after
promoted to the rank of a &s;ubaltern, and the office
of equerry to his own &s;on, who, at that time, had
attained to the degree of colonel, though his age
did not exceed eighteen years.</P>
<P>This young man was naturally of a ferocious
di&s;po&s;ition, which had been rendered quite un|tractable
by the pride of birth and fortune, toge|ther
with the licence of his education. As he did
not know the re&s;pect due to a gentleman, &s;o
he could not po&s;&s;ibly pay it to tho&s;e who were
unfortunately under his command. Divers mor|tifications
I &s;u&s;tained with that fortitude which
became a Ca&s;tilian who lay under obligations to
the father; till at length, laying a&s;ide all deco|rum,
he &s;mote me. Sacred heaven! he &s;mote
<PB N="231" REF="232">
don Diego de Zelos, in pre&s;ence of his whole
hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>Had my &s;word been endowed with &s;en&s;ation,
it would of it&s;elf have &s;tarted from the &s;cabbard,
at this indignity offered to its ma&s;ter. I un|&s;heathed
it without deliberation, &s;aying, &startq;Know,
in&s;olent boy, he is a gentleman whom thou ha&s;t
thus outraged; and thou ha&s;t cancelled the ties
which have hitherto re&s;trained my indignation.&endq;
His &s;ervants would have interpo&s;ed, but he com|manded
them to retire; and flu&s;hed with that
confidence which the impetuo&s;ity of his temper
in&s;pired, he drew, in his turn, and attacked me
with redoubled rage; but his dexterity being very
unequal to his courage, he was &s;oon di&s;armed
and overthrown; when pointing my &s;word to his
brea&s;t, &startq;In con&s;ideration of thy youth and ig|norance,
&s;aid I, I &s;pare that life which thou ha&s;t
forfeited by thy ungenerous pre&s;umption.&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e words I put up my weapon, retired
through the mid&s;t of his dome&s;tics, who &s;eeing
their ma&s;ter &s;afe, did not think proper to oppo&s;e
my pa&s;&s;age, and mounting my hor&s;e, in le&s;s than
two hours entered the Au&s;trian dominions, re|&s;olving
to proceed as far as Holland, that I might
embark in the fir&s;t &s;hip for Spain, in order to
wa&s;h away, with my own blood, or that of my
enemies, the cruel &s;tain which hath &s;o long defiled
my reputation.</P>
<P>This was the grievance that &s;till corroded my
heart, and rendered ineffectual the inhuman &s;a|crifice
I had made to my injured honour. This
was the con&s;ideration that ince&s;&s;antly prompted,
and &s;till importunes me to run every ri&s;que of life
and fortune, rather than leave my fame under
&s;uch an ignominious a&s;per&s;ion. I purpo&s;e to obey
<PB N="232" REF="233">
this internal call. I am apt to believe it is the
voice of heaven; of that providence which ma|nife&s;ted
its care by &s;ending &s;uch a generous auxi|liary
to my aid, when I was overpowered by ban|ditti,
on the very fir&s;t day of my expedition.&endq;</P>
<P>Having in this manner gratified the curio&s;ity
of his deliverer, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of knowing
the quality of him to whom he was &s;o &s;ignally
obliged; and Renaldo did not &s;cruple to make the
Ca&s;tilian acquainted with his name and family:
he likewi&s;e communicated the &s;tory of his unfor|tunate
love, with all the &s;ymptoms of unutterable
woe, which drew tears from the noble-hearted
Spaniard, while with a groan that announced the
load which overwhelmed his &s;oul, &startq;I had a
daughter, &s;aid he, &s;uch as you de&s;cribe the peer|le&s;s
Monimia, had heaven decreed her for the
arms of &s;uch a lover, I, who am now the mo&s;t
wretched, &s;hould have been the mo&s;t happy pa|rent
upon earth.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus did the&s;e new friends alternately indulge
their mutual &s;orrow, and concert mea&s;ures for
their future operations. Melvile earne&s;tly &s;olli|cited
the Ca&s;tilian to favour him with his compa|ny
to England, where, in all probability, both
would enjoy the gloomy &s;atisfaction of being re|venged
upon their common betrayer Fathom;
and as a farther inducement, he a&s;&s;ured him, that
as &s;oon as he &s;hould have accompli&s;hed the me|lancholy
purpo&s;es of his voyage, he would ac|company
don Diego to Spain, and employ his
whole intere&s;t and fortune in his &s;ervice. The
Spaniard, thunder&s;truck at the extravagant gene|ro&s;ity
of this propo&s;al, could &s;carce believe the
evidence of his own &s;en&s;es, and after &s;ome pau&s;e,
replied, &startq;My duty would teach me to obey any
<PB N="233" REF="234">
command you &s;hould think proper to impo&s;e;
but here my inclination and intere&s;t are &s;o agree|ably
flattered, that I &s;hould be equally ungrateful
and unwi&s;e, in pretending to comply with re|luctance.&endq;</P>
<P>This point being &s;ettled, they moved forwards
to Mons, as &s;oon as don Diego was in a condition
to bear the &s;hock of &s;uch a removal; and there
remaining until his wounds were perfectly cured,
they hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e for O&s;tend, embarked in
a ve&s;&s;el at that port, reached the oppo&s;ite &s;hore
of England, after a &s;hort and ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age, and
arrived in London without having met with any
&s;ini&s;ter accident on the road.</P>
<P>As they approached this capital, Renaldo's
grief &s;eemed to regurgitate with redoubled vio|lence.
His memory was waked to the mo&s;t minute
and painful exertion of its faculties; his imagina|tion
teemed with the mo&s;t afflicting images, and
his impatience became &s;o ardent, that never lo|ver
panted more eagerly for the con&s;ummation of
his wi&s;hes, than Melvile for an opportunity of
&s;tretching him&s;elf upon the grave of the lo&s;t Mo|nimia.
The Ca&s;tilian was a&s;toni&s;hed, as well as
affected at the poignancy of his grief, which, as
a proof of his &s;u&s;ceptibility and virtue, endeared
him &s;till more to his affection; and though his
own misfortunes had rendered him very unfit for
the office of a comforter, he endeavoured, by
&s;oothing di&s;cour&s;e, to moderate the exce&s;s of his
friend's affliction.</P>
<P>Though it was dark when they alighted at the
inn, Melvile ordered a coach to be called, and
being attended by the Spaniard, who would not
be per&s;uaded to quit him upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion,
he repaired to the hou&s;e of the generous Jew,
<PB N="234" REF="235">
who&s;e rheum di&s;tilled very plentifully at his ap|proach.
The count had already acquitted him|&s;elf
in point of pecuniary obligations to this bene|volent
Hebrew; and now, after having made
&s;uch acknowledgments as might be expected from
a youth of his di&s;po&s;ition, he begged to know by
what channel he had received that letter, which
he had been &s;o kind as to forward to Vienna.</P>
<P>Jo&s;hua, who was ignorant of the contents of
that epi&s;tle, and &s;aw the young gentleman ex|tremely
moved, would have eluded his enquiry,
by pretending he had forgot the circum&s;tance;
but when he under&s;tood the nature of the ca&s;e,
which was not explained without the manife&s;ta|tion
of the utmo&s;t inquietude, he heartily con|doled
the de&s;ponding lover, telling him he had in
vain employed all his intelligence about that un|fortunate
beauty, in con&s;equence of Melvile's
letter to him on that &s;ubject; and then directed
him to the hou&s;e of that phy&s;ician, who had
brought the fatal billet which had made him mi|&s;erable.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did he receive this information than
he took his leave abruptly, with promi&s;e of re|turning
next day, and hied him to the lodgings of
that gentleman, whom he was lucky enough to
find at home. Being &s;avoured with a private au|dience,
&startq;When I tell you, &s;aid he, that my
name is Renaldo count de Melvile, you will
know me to be the mo&s;t unfortunate of men. By
that letter, which you committed to the charge of
my worthy friend Jo&s;hua, the fatal veil was re|moved
from my eyes, which had been &s;o long
darkened by the artifices of incredible deceit, and
my own incurable mi&s;ery fully pre&s;ented to my
<PB N="235" REF="236">
view. If you were acquainted with the unhappy fair,
who hath fallen a victim to my mi&s;take, you will
have &s;ome idea of the in&s;ufferable pangs which I
now feel in recollecting her fate. If you have
compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e pangs, you will not refu&s;e to
conduct me to the &s;pot where the dear remains of
Monimia are depo&s;ited; there let me enjoy a full
banquet of woe; there let me fea&s;t that worm of
&s;orrow that pre$s upon my heart: for &s;uch enter|tainment
have I revi&s;ited this (to me) ill-omened
i&s;le: for this &s;atisfaction I intrude upon your con|de&s;cen&s;ion
at the&s;e un&s;ea&s;onable hours; for to &s;uch
a degree of impatience is my affliction whetted,
that no &s;lumber &s;hall a&s;&s;ail mine eyelids, no peace
re&s;ide within my bo&s;om, until I &s;hall have adored
that earthy &s;hrine where my Monimia lies! Yet
would I know the circum&s;tances of her fate. Did
heaven ordain no angel to mini&s;ter to her di&s;tre&s;s?
were her la&s;t moments comfortle&s;s? ha! was not
&s;he abandoned to indigence, to in&s;ults; left in
the power of that inhuman villain who betrayed
us both! Sacred heaven! why did providence
wink at the triumph of &s;uch con&s;ummate per|&s;idy?&endq;</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician having li&s;tened with complacen|cy
to this effu&s;ion, replied, &startq;It is my profe&s;&s;ion,
it is my nature to &s;ympathize with the afflicted. I
am a judge of your feelings, becau&s;e I know the
value of your lo&s;s. I attended the incomparable
Monimia in her la&s;t illne&s;s, and am well errough
acquainted with her &s;tory, to conclude, that &s;he
fell a &s;acrifice to an unhappy mi&s;under&s;tanding,
effected and &s;omented by that traitor who abu&s;ed
your mutual confidence.&endq;</P>
<P>He then proceeded to inform him of all the
particulars which we have already recorded, touch|ing
<PB N="236" REF="237">
the de&s;tiny of the beauteous orphan, and con|cluded
with telling him he was ready to yield him
any other &s;atisfaction which it was in his power to
grant. The circum&s;tances of the tale had put
Renaldo's &s;pirits into &s;uch commotion, that he
could utter nothing but interjections and uncon|nected
words. When Fathom's behaviour was
de&s;cribed, he trembled with fierce agitation, &s;tart|ed
from his chair, pronouncing, &startq;Mon&s;ter!
fiend! but we &s;hall one day meet.&endq;</P>
<P>When he was made acquainted with the bene|volence
of the French lady, he exclaimed, &startq;O
heaven-born charity and compa&s;&s;ion! &s;ure that
mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;pirit of grace &s;ent hither to miti|gate
the tortures of life! where &s;hall I find her,
to offer up my thanks and adoration?&endq; Having
heard the conclu&s;ion of the detail, he embraced
the relater, as the kind benefactor of Monimia,
&s;hed a flood of tears in his bo&s;om, and pre&s;&s;ed
him to crown the obligation, by conducting him
to the &s;olitary place where now &s;he re&s;ted from
all her cares.</P>
<P>The gentleman perceiving the tran&s;ports of his
grief were &s;uch as could not be oppo&s;ed, com|plied
with his reque&s;t, attended him in the vehi|cle,
and directed the coachman to drive to a &s;e|que&s;tered
field, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city,
where &s;tood the church, within who&s;e awful i&s;le
this &s;cene was to be acted. The &s;exton being
&s;ummoned from his bed, produced the keys, in
con&s;equence of a gratification, after the phy&s;ician
had communed with him apart, and explained
the intention of Renaldo's vi&s;it.</P>
<P>During this pau&s;e, the &s;oul of Melvile was
wound up to the highe&s;t pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;or|row.
The uncommon darkne&s;s of the night, the
<PB N="237" REF="238">
&s;olemn &s;ilence, and lonely &s;ituation of the place,
con&s;pired with the occa&s;ion of his coming, and
the di&s;mal images of his fancy, to produce a real
rapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole
world would not have per&s;uaded him to di&s;ap|point.
The clock &s;truck twelve, the owl &s;creech|ed
from the ruined battlement, the door was o|pened
by the &s;exton, who, by the light of a glim|mering
taper, conducted the de&s;pairing lover to a
dreary i&s;le, and &s;tamped upon the ground with
his foot, &s;aying, &startq;Here the young lady lies in|terred.&endq;</P>
<P>Melvile no &s;ooner received this intimation,
than falling on his knees, and pre&s;&s;ing his lips to
the hallowed earth: &startq;Peace, cried he, to the
gentle tenant of this &s;ilent habitation.&endq; Then
turning to the by&s;tanders, with a blood&s;hot eye,
&s;aid, &startq;Leave me to the full enjoyment of this
occa&s;ion: my grief is too delicate to admit the
company even of my friends: the rites to be per|formed
require privacy: adieu then, here mu&s;t I
pa&s;s the night alone.&endq;</P>
<P>The doctor, alarmed at this declaration, which
he was afraid imported &s;ome re&s;olution fatal to his
own life, began to repent of having been acce&s;&s;|ary
to the vi&s;it, attempted to di&s;&s;uade him from
his purpo&s;e, and finding him ob&s;tinately deter|mined,
called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;exton and
coachman, and &s;ollicited the aid of don Diego,
to force Renaldo from the execution of his de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tilian, knowing his friend was then ve|ry
unfit for common altercation, interpo&s;ed in the
di&s;pute, &s;aying, &startq;You need not be afraid that
he will obey the dictates of de&s;pair: his religion,
his honour will baffle &s;uch temptations: he hath
<PB N="238" REF="239">
promi&s;ed to re&s;erve his life for the occa&s;ions of his
friend; and he &s;hall not be di&s;appointed in his pre|&s;ent
aim.&endq; In order to corroborate this peremp|tory
addre&s;s, which was delivered in the French
language, he un&s;heathed his &s;word, and the others
retreating at &s;ight of his weapon, &startq;Count, &s;aid
he, enjoy your grief in full tran&s;port&s; I will
&s;creen you from interruption, though at the ha|zard
of my life; and while you give a loo&s;e to
&s;orrow, within that gha&s;tly vault, I will watch till
morning in the porch, and meditate upon the ruin
of my own family and peace.&endq;</P>
<P>He accordingly prevailed upon the phy&s;ician to
retire, after he had &s;atisfied the &s;exton, and or|dered
the coachman to return by break of day.</P>
<P>Renaldo thus left alone, pro&s;trated him&s;elf up|on
the grave, and poured forth &s;uch lamentations
as would have drawn tears from the mo&s;t &s;avage
hearer. He called aloud upon Monimia's name,
&startq;Are the&s;e the nuptial joys to which our fate
hath doomed us? Is this the fruit of tho&s;e endear|ing
hopes, that intercour&s;e divine, that raptured
admiration, in which &s;o many hours in&s;en&s;ibly e|lap&s;ed!
where now are tho&s;e attractions, to which
I yielded up my captive heart? quenched are
tho&s;e genial eyes that gladdened each beholder,
and &s;hone the planets of my happine&s;s and peace!
cold! cold and withered are tho&s;e lips that &s;well|ed
with love, and far out-blu&s;hed the dama&s;k
ro&s;e! and ah! for ever &s;ilenced is that tongue,
who&s;e eloquence had power to lull the pangs of
mi&s;ery and care! no more &s;hall my attention be
ravi&s;hed with the mu&s;ic of that voice, which u&s;ed
to thrill in &s;oft vibrations to my &s;oul! O &s;ainted
&s;pirit! O un&s;potted &s;hade of her whom I adored;
of her who&s;e memory I &s;hall &s;till revere with
<PB N="239" REF="240">
ever-bleeding &s;orrow and regret; of her who&s;e
image will be the la&s;t idea that for&s;akes this hap|le&s;s
bo&s;om! now art thou con&s;cious of my inte|grity
and love; now do&s;t thou behold the angui&s;h
that I feel. If the pure e&s;&s;ence of thy nature will
permit, wilt thou, ah! wilt thou indulge this
wretched youth with &s;ome kind &s;ignal of thy no|tice,
with &s;ome token of thy approbation? wilt
thou a&s;&s;ume a medium of embodied air, in &s;em|blance
of that lovely form, which now lies
mouldering in this dreary tomb, and &s;peak the
words of peace to my di&s;tempered &s;oul! Return,
Monimia! appear, though but for one &s;hort mo|ment,
to my longing eyes! vouch&s;afe one &s;mile;
Renaldo will be &s;atisfied; Renaldo's heart will be
at re&s;t; his grief no more will overflow its banks,
but glide with equal current to his late&s;t hour!
Alas! the&s;e are the raving of my delirious &s;orrow!
Monimia hears not my complaints; her &s;oul,
&s;ublimed far, far above all &s;ublunary cares, en|joys
that felicity, of which &s;he was debarred on
earth. In vain I &s;tretch the&s;e eyes, environed
with darkne&s;s undi&s;tingui&s;hing and void: no ob|ject
meets my view; no &s;ound &s;alutes mine ear,
except the noi&s;y wind that whi&s;tles through the&s;e
vaulted caves of death.&endq;</P>
<P>In this kind of exclamation did Renaldo pa&s;s
the night, not without a certain &s;pecies of woful
enjoyment, which the &s;oul is often able to conjure
up from the depths of di&s;tre&s;s; in&s;omuch, that
when the morning intruded on his privacy, he
could &s;carce believe it was the light of day, &s;o fa&s;t
had fleeted the minutes of his devotion.</P>
<P>His heart being thus di&s;burthened, and his impa|tience
gratified, he became &s;o calm and compo&s;ed,
that don Diego was equally plea&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed
<PB N="240" REF="241">
at the air of &s;erenity with which he came forth,
and embraced him with warm acknowledgments
of his goodne&s;s and attachment: he frankly own|ed,
that his mind was now more at ea&s;e than he
had ever found it, &s;ince he fir&s;t received the fatal
intimation of his lo&s;s; that a few &s;uch fea&s;ts
would entirely moderate the keen appetite of his
&s;orrow, which he would afterwards feed with le&s;s
precipitation.</P>
<P>He al&s;o imparted to the Ca&s;tilian, the plan
of a monument, which he had de&s;igned for the
incomparable Monimia; and don Diego was &s;o
much &s;truck with the de&s;cription, that he &s;oli|cited
his advice in projecting another, of a diffe|rent
nature, to be erected to the memory of his
own ill-fated wife and daughter, &s;hould he ever
be able to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in Spain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="63" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He renews the rites of &s;orrow, and is entranced.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE they amu&s;ed them&s;elves with
this &s;ort of conver&s;ation, the phy&s;ician
returned with the coach, and accompanied them
back to their inn, where he left them to their re|po&s;e,
after having promi&s;ed to call again at noon,
and conduct Renaldo to the hou&s;e of madame
Clement, the benefactre&s;s of Monimia, to whom
he eagerly de&s;ired to be introduced.</P>
<P>The appointment was ob&s;erved with all ima|ginable
punctuality on both &s;ides. Melvile had
arrayed him&s;elf in a &s;uit of deep mourning, and
he found the good lady in the like habit, a&s;&s;umed
upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion: the goodne&s;s of her heart
was manife&s;t in her countenance; the &s;en&s;ibility
<PB N="241" REF="242">
of the youth di&s;covered it&s;elf in a flood of tears,
which he &s;hed at her appearance. His &s;en&s;ations
were too full for utterance; nor was &s;he for &s;ome
time, able to give him welcome: while &s;he led
him by the hand to a &s;eat, the drops of &s;ympathy
ru&s;hed into either eye; and at length &s;he broke
&s;ilence, &s;aying, &startq;Count, we mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in
the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence; and quiet the
tran&s;ports of our grief, with a full a&s;&s;urance that
Monimia is happy.&endq;</P>
<P>This name was the key that unlocked the fa|culty
of his &s;peech. &startq;I mu&s;t &s;trive, &s;aid he, to
ea&s;e the angui&s;h of my heart with that con&s;ola|tion.
But &s;ay, humane, benevolent lady, to who&s;e
compa&s;&s;ion and genero&s;ity that haple&s;s orphan was
indebted for the la&s;t peaceful moment &s;he enjoyed
upon earth; &s;ay, in all your acquaintance with
human nature, in all your intercour&s;e with the
daughters of men, in all the exerci&s;e of your cha|rity
and beneficence, did you ever ob&s;erve &s;uch
&s;weetne&s;s, purity, and truth; &s;uch beauty, &s;en&s;e,
and perfection, as that which was the inheritance
of her who&s;e fate I &s;hall for ever deplore? &startq;She
was indeed, replied the lady, the be&s;t and faire&s;t
of our &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>This was the beginning of a conver&s;ation touch|ing
that lovely victim, in the cour&s;e of which, he
explained tho&s;e wicked arts which Fathom prac|ti&s;ed
to alienate his affections from the adorable
Monimia; and &s;he de&s;cribed the cunning hints
and fal&s;e in&s;inuations by which that traitor had
a&s;per&s;ed the un&s;u&s;pecting lover, and &s;oiled his
character in the opinion of the virtuous or|phan.
The intelligence he obtained, on this
occa&s;ion, added indignation to his grief: the
<PB N="242" REF="243">
whole my&s;tery of Monimia's behaviour, which
he could not before explain, now &s;tood di&s;|clo&s;ed
before him: he &s;aw the gradual progre&s;s of
that infernal plan, which had been laid for their
mutual ruin; and his &s;oul was inflamed with &s;uch
de&s;ire of vengeance, that he would have taken his
leave abruptly, in order to &s;et on foot an imme|diate
enquiry about the perfidious author of his
wrongs, that he might exterminate &s;uch a mon&s;ter
of iniquity from the face of the earth; but he
was re&s;trained by madame Clement, who gave
him to under&s;tand, that Fathom was already over|taken
by the vengeance of heaven: for &s;he had
traced him in all the cour&s;e of his fortune, from
his fir&s;t appearance in the medical &s;phere to his to|tal
eclip&s;e. She repre&s;ented the villain as a wretch
altogether unworthy of his attention; &s;he &s;aid, he
was &s;o covered with infamy, that no per&s;on could
enter the li&s;ts again&s;t him, without bearing away
&s;ome &s;tain of di&s;honour; that he was, at pre&s;ent,
peculiarly protected by the law, and &s;heltered
from the re&s;entment of Renaldo, in the cavern of
his di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Melvile, glowing with rage, replied, that he
was a venomous &s;erpent, which it was incumbent
on every foot to cru&s;h; that it was the duty of
every man to contribute his whole power in free|ing
&s;ociety from &s;uch a pernicious hypocrite; and
that if &s;uch in&s;tances of perfidy and ingratitude
were &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity, virtue and
plain-dealing would &s;oon be expelled from the ha|bitations
of men. &startq;Over and above the&s;e mo|tives,
&s;aid he, I own my&s;elf &s;o vitiated with the
allay of human pa&s;&s;ion and infirmity, that I de|&s;ire,
I eagerly pant for an occa&s;ion of meeting
him hand to hand, where I may upbraid him
<PB N="243" REF="244">
with his treachery, and &s;hower down vengeance
and de&s;truction on his perfidious head.&endq;</P>
<P>Then he recounted the anecdotes of our ad|venturer,
which he had learned in Germany and
Flanders, and concluded with declaring his unal|terable
re&s;olution of relea&s;ing him from jail, that
he might have an opportunity of &s;acrificing him,
with his own hand, to the manes of Monimia.
The di&s;creet lady, perceiving the perturbation of
his mind, would not further combat the impetuo|&s;ity
of his pa&s;&s;ion; contenting her&s;elf with exact|ing
a promi&s;e, that he would not execute his pur|po&s;e,
until he &s;hould have deliberated three days
upon the con&s;equences by which a &s;tep of that
kind might be attended: before the expiration
of that term, &s;he thought mea&s;ures might be ta|ken
to prevent the young gentleman from ex|po&s;ing
his life or reputation to unnece&s;&s;ary ha|zard.</P>
<P>Having complied with her reque&s;t in this par|ticular,
he took his leave, after he had, by re|peated
entreaties, prevailed upon her to accept a
jewel, in token of his veneration for the kind be|nefactre&s;s
of his decea&s;ed Monimia: nor could his
generous heart be &s;atisfied, until he had forced a
con&s;iderable pre&s;ent on the humane phy&s;ician, who
had attended her in her la&s;t moments, and now
di&s;covered a particular &s;ympathy and concern for
her de&s;ponding lover. This gentleman attended
him to the hou&s;e of the benevolent Jo&s;hua, where
they dined, and where don Diego was recom|mended,
in the mo&s;t fervid terms of friend&s;hip,
to the good offices of their ho&s;t. Not that this
duty was performed in pre&s;ence of the &s;tranger,
Renaldo's delicacy would not expo&s;e his friend to
&s;uch a &s;ituation: while the phy&s;ician, before din|ner,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
entertained that &s;tranger in one apartment,
Melvile withdrew into another, with the Jew, to
whom he di&s;clo&s;ed the affair of the Ca&s;tilian, with
certain circum&s;tances, which &s;hall, in due time,
be revealed.</P>
<P>Jo&s;hua's curio&s;ity being whetted by this informa|tion,
he could not help eying the Spaniard at table,
with &s;uch a particular &s;tare, that don Diego per|ceived
his attention, and took umbrage at the free|dom
of his regard. Being unable to conceal his
di&s;plea&s;ure, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Hebrew,
with great &s;olemnity, in the Spani&s;h tongue, &s;ay|ing,
&startq;Signior, is there any &s;ingularity in my
appearance? or, do you recollect the features of
don Diego de Zelos?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Signior don Diego, replied the other in pure
Ca&s;tilian, I crave your pardon for the rudene&s;s of
my curio&s;ity, which prompted me to &s;urvey a no|bleman,
who&s;e character I revere, and to who&s;e
misfortunes I am no &s;tranger; indeed, were cu|rio&s;ity
alone concerned, I &s;hould be without ex|cu&s;e,
but as I am heartily inclined to &s;erve you,
as far as my weak abilities extend, I hope your
genero&s;ity will not impute any little involuntary
tre&s;pa&s;s of punctilio to my want of cordiality or
e&s;teem.&endq;</P>
<P>The Spaniard was not only appea&s;ed by this
apology, but al&s;o affected with the compliment,
and the language in which it was conveyed. He
thanked the Jew for his kind declaration, intreat|ed
him to bear with the peevi&s;hne&s;s of a di&s;po&s;i|tion,
&s;ore with the galling hand of affliction; and
turning up his eyes to heaven, &startq;Were it po&s;&s;i|ble,
cried he, for fate to reconcile contradictions,
and recal the irremeable current of events, I
would now believe, that there was happine&s;s &s;till
<PB N="245" REF="246">
re&s;erve for the forlorn Zelos: now that I tread
the land of freedom and humanity; now that I
find my&s;elf befriended by the mo&s;t generous of
men. Alas! I a&s;k not happine&s;s! if by the kind
endeavours of the gallant count de Melvile, to
whom I am already indebted for my life; and by
the efforts of his friends, the honour of my name
&s;hall be purified and cleared from the poi&s;onous
&s;tains of malice, by which it is at pre&s;ent &s;potted;
I &s;hall then enjoy all that &s;atisfaction, which de|&s;tiny
can be&s;tow upon a wretch who&s;e woes are
incurable.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo comforted him with the a&s;&s;urance of
his being on the eve of triumphing over his adver|&s;aries;
and Jo&s;hua confirmed the con&s;olation, by
giving him to under&s;tand, that he had corre&s;pon|dents
in Spain, of &s;ome influence in the &s;tate;
that he had already written to them on the &s;ub|ject
of don Diego, in con&s;equence of a letter
which he had received from Melvile, while he
tarried at Mons, and that he, every po&s;t, expect|ed
a favourable an&s;wer on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After dinner, the phy&s;ician took his leave,
though not before he had promi&s;ed to meet Re|naldo
at night, and accompany him in the repe|tition
of his midnight vi&s;it to Monimia's tomb:
for this pilgrimage the unfortunate youth re|&s;olved
nightly to perform, during the whole time
of his re&s;idence in England: it was, indeed, a
&s;ort of plea&s;ure, the pro&s;pect of which enabled
him to bear the toil of living through the day;
though his patience was almo&s;t quite exhau&s;ted
before the hour of a&s;&s;ignation arrived.</P>
<P>When the doctor appeared with the coach, he
leaped into it with great eagerne&s;s, after he had,
with much difficulty, prevailed with don Diego to
<PB N="246" REF="247">
&s;tay at home, on account of his health, which
was not yet perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Ca&s;$ilian,
however, would not comply with his reque&s;t, un|til
he had obtained the count's promi&s;e, that he
&s;hould be permitted to accompany him next night,
and take that duty alternately with the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>About midnight they reached the place, where
they found the &s;exton in waiting, according to the
orders he had received: the door was opened, the
mourner conducted to the tomb, and left, as be|fore,
to the gloom of his own meditations. A|gain
he laid him&s;elf on the cold ground; again he
renewed his lamentable &s;train; his imagination
began to be heated into an exta&s;y of enthu&s;ia&s;m,
during which, he again fervently invoked the &s;pi|rit
of his decea&s;ed Monimia.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e invocations, his ear was
&s;uddenly invaded with the &s;ound of &s;ome few &s;o|lemn
notes, i&s;&s;uing from the organ, which &s;eem|ed
to feel the impul&s;e of an invi&s;ible hand.</P>
<P>At this awful &s;alutation, Melvile was rou&s;ed to
the keene&s;t &s;en&s;e of &s;urprize and attention: rea&s;on
&s;hrunk before the thronging ideas of his fancy,
which repre&s;ented this mu&s;ick as the prelude to
&s;omething &s;trange and &s;upernatural; and while he
waited for the &s;equel, the place was &s;uddenly illu|minated,
and each &s;urrounding object brought un|der
the cognizance of his eye.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed within his mind on this occa&s;ion,
is not ea&s;y to be de&s;cribed: all his faculties were
&s;wallowed up by tho&s;e of &s;eeing and of hearing:
he had mechanically rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon one
knee, with his body advancing forwards; and in
this attitude he gazed with a look, through which
his &s;oul &s;eemed eager to e&s;cape. To his view,
thus &s;trained upon vacant &s;pace, in a few minutes
<PB N="247" REF="248">
appeared the figure of a woman arrayed in white,
with a veil that covered her face, and flowed down
upon her back and &s;houlders: The phantome ap|proached
him with an ea&s;y &s;tep, and, lifting up
her veil, di&s;covered (believe it, O reader!) the
individual countenance of Monimia.</P>
<P>At &s;ight of the&s;e well-known features, &s;eeming|ly
improved with new cele&s;tial graces, the youth
became a &s;tatue, expre&s;&s;ing amazement, love,
and awful adoration. He &s;aw the apparition &s;mile
with meek benevolence, divine compa&s;&s;ion, warm|ed
and intendered by that fond, pure flame, which
death could not extingui&s;h: he heard the voice
of his Monimia call Renaldo! Thrice he e&s;&s;ayed
to an&s;wer; as oft his tongue denied its office:
his hair &s;tood upright, and a cold vapour &s;eemed
to thrill through every nerve. This was not fear,
but the infirmity of human nature, oppre&s;&s;ed by
the pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>At length his agony was overcome; he recol|lected
all his re&s;olution, and in a &s;train of awe|&s;truck
rapture, thus addre&s;&s;ed the heavenly vi&s;i|tant.
&startq;Ha&s;t thou then heard, pure &s;pirit! the
wailings of my grief? ha&s;t thou de&s;cended from
the realms of bli&s;s, in pity to my woe? and art
thou come to &s;peak the words of peace to my de|&s;ponding
&s;oul? To bid the wretched &s;mile; to lift
the load of mi&s;ery and care from the afflicted
brea&s;t; to fill thy lover's heart with joy and plea|&s;ing
hope, was &s;till the darling ta&s;k of my Moni|mia,
e're yet refined to that perfection, which
mortality can never attain: no wonder then,
ble&s;t &s;hade, that now, when reunited to thy na|tive
heaven, thou art &s;till kind, propitious, and
beneficent to us, who groan in this inho&s;pitable
vale of &s;orrow thou ha&s;t left: tell me, ah! tell
<PB N="248" REF="249">
me, do&s;t thou &s;till remember tho&s;e fond hours we
pa&s;&s;ed together? Doth that enlightened bo&s;om
feel a pang of &s;oft regret, when thou recalle&s;t
our fatal &s;eparation? Sure that meekened glance
be&s;peaks thy &s;ympathy! Ah! how that tender look
o'erpowers me! Sacred heaven! the pearly drops
of pity trickle down thy ch$$ks! Such are the
tears that angels &s;hed o'er man's di&s;tre&s;s! Turn
not away: thou beckone&s;t me to follow: yes, I
will follow thee, aetherial &s;pirit, as far as the&s;e
weak limbs, encumbered with mortality, will
bear my weight; and, would to heaven! I could,
with ea&s;e, put off the&s;e vile, corporeal &s;hackles,
and attend thy flight.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;tarted from the ground, and in
a tran&s;port of eager expectation, at awful di&s;tance,
traced the foot&s;teps of the apparition, which en|tering
a detached apartment, &s;unk down upon a
chair, and with a &s;igh exclaimed, &startq;Indeed, this
is too much!&endq; What was the di&s;order of Renal|do's
mind, when he perceived this phaenomenon!
Before reflection could perform its office, moved
by a &s;udden impul&s;e, he &s;prung forwards, crying,
&startq;If it be death to touch thee, let me die!&endq; and
caught in his arms, not the &s;hadow, but the
warm &s;ub&s;tance of the all-accompli&s;hed Monimia.
&startq;My&s;terious powers of providence! this is no
phantome! this is no &s;hade! this is the life! the
panting bo&s;om of her whom I have &s;o long, &s;o
bitterly deplored! I &s;old her in my arms! I pre&s;s
her glowing brea&s;t to mine! I &s;ee her blu&s;h with
virtuous plea&s;ure and ingenuous love! &s;he &s;miles
upon me with inchanting tenderne&s;s! O let me
gaze on that tran&s;cendent beauty, which the more
I view it, ravi&s;hes the more! The&s;e charms are
too inten&s;e; I &s;icken while I gaze! Merciful
<PB N="249" REF="250">
heaven! is not this a mere illu&s;ion of the brain?
Was &s;he not fled for ever? Had not the cold
hand of death divorced her from my hope? This
mu&s;t be &s;ome flattering vi&s;ion of my di&s;tempered
fancy! perhaps &s;ome &s;oothing dream: if &s;uch it
be, grant, O ye heavenly powers! that I may ne|ver
wake.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O gentle youth! (replied the beauteous or|phan,
&s;till cla&s;ped in his embrace) what joy now
fills the bo&s;om of Monimia, at this triumph of thy
virtue and thy love? When I &s;ee the&s;e tran&s;ports
of thy affection, when I find thee re&s;tored to that
place in my e&s;teem and admiration, which thou
had&s;t lo&s;t by the arts of calumny and malice! this
is a meeting which my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes dur&s;t
not pre&s;age!&endq;</P>
<P>So entirely were the faculties of Renaldo en|gro&s;&s;ed
in the contemplation of his re&s;tored Mo|nimia,
that he &s;aw not the re&s;t of the company,
who wept with tran&s;port over this affecting &s;cene:
he was therefore amazed at the interpo&s;ition of
madame Clement, who, while the &s;hower of &s;ym|pathetic
plea&s;ure bedewed her cheeks, congratu|lated
the lovers upon this happy event, crying,
&startq;The&s;e are the joys which virtue calls her own.&endq;
They al&s;o received the compliments of a reve|rend
clergyman, who told Monimia, &s;he had reap|ed,
at la&s;t, the fruits of that pious re&s;ignation to
the will of heaven, which &s;he had &s;o devoutly
practi&s;ed during the term of her affliction: and,
la&s;tly, they were acco&s;ted by the phy&s;ician, who
was not quite &s;o hackneyed in the ways of death,
or &s;o callous to the finer &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul, but
that he blubbered plentifully, while he petitioned
heaven in behalf of &s;uch an accompli&s;hed and de|&s;erving
pair.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="251">
Monimia taking madame Clement by the
hand, &startq;Whatever joy, &s;aid &s;he, Renaldo de|rives
from this occa&s;ion, is owing to the bounty,
the compa&s;&s;ion, and maternal care of this incom|parable
lady, together with the kind admonitions
and humanity of the&s;e two worthy gentlemen.&endq;</P>
<P>Melvile, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were &s;till in agitation,
and who&s;e mind could not yet dige&s;t the incidents
that occurred, embraced them all by turns, but,
like the faithful needle, which though &s;haken, for
an in&s;tant, from its poize, immediately regains its
true direction and points invariably to the pole, he
&s;oon returned to his Monimia; again he held her
in his arms; again he drank inchantment from
her eyes, and thus poured forth the effu&s;ions of
his &s;oul. &startq;Can I then tru&s;t the evidence of
&s;en&s;e? And art thou really to my wi&s;h re&s;tored?
Never, O never did thy beauty &s;hine with &s;uch
bewitching grace, as that which now confounds
and captivates my view! &s;ure there is &s;omething
more than mortal in thy looks! where ha&s;t thou
lived? where borrowed this perfection? whence
art thou now de&s;cended? Oh! I am all amaze|ment,
joy and fear! thou wilt not leave me! no!
we mu&s;t not part again: by this warm ki&s;s! a
thou&s;and times more &s;weet than all the fragrance
of the ea&s;t! we never more will part. O this is
rapture, exta&s;y, and what no language can ex|plain!&endq;</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e ejaculations, he ravi&s;hed
a banquet from her glowing lips, that kindled in
his heart a flame, which ru&s;hed thro' every vein,
and glided to his marrow: this was a privilege he
had never claimed before, and now permitted as a
recompence for all the penance he had &s;uffered;
neverthele&s;s, the cheeks of Monimia, who was
<PB N="251" REF="252">
altogether unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch familiarities, un|derwent
a total &s;uffu&s;ion; and madame Clement
di&s;creetly relieved her from the anxiety of her &s;i|tuation,
by interfering in the di&s;cour&s;e, and rally|ing
the count, upon his endeavours to monopo|lize
&s;uch a branch of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;O my dear lady! (replied Renaldo, who by
this time had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, recovered his re|collection)
forgive the wild tran&s;ports of a fond
lover, who hath &s;o unexpectedly retrieved the
jewel of his &s;oul! yet, far from wi&s;hing to hoard
up his trea&s;ure, he means to communicate and
diffu&s;e his happine&s;s to all his friends. O my
Monimia! how will the plea&s;ure of this hour be
propagated! As yet thou knowe&s;t not all the bli&s;s
that is re&s;erved for thy enjoyment: mean while,
I long to learn, by what contrivance this happy
interview hath been effected: &s;till am I ignorant,
how I was tran&s;ported into this apartment, from
the lonely vault, in which I mourned over my
&s;uppo&s;ed misfortune!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="64" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The my&s;tery unfolded. Another recognition, which,
it is to be hoped, the reader could not fore&s;ee.</HEAD>
<P>THE French lady then explained the whole
my&s;tery of Monimia's death, as a &s;trata|gem
&s;he had concerted with the clergyman and
doctor, in order to defeat the pernicious de&s;igns
of Fathom, who &s;eemed determined to &s;upport
his fal&s;e preten&s;ions, by dint of perjury and fraud,
which they would have found it very difficult to
clude. She ob&s;erved, that the phy&s;ician had
actually de&s;paired of Monimia's life, and it was
<PB N="252" REF="253">
not till after &s;he her&s;elf was made acquainted with
the progno&s;tick, that &s;he wrote the letter to Re|naldo,
which &s;he committed to the care of ma|dame
Clement, with an earne&s;t intreaty, that it
&s;hould not be &s;ent till after her decea&s;e: but that
lady believing the count had been certainly abu&s;ed
by his treacherous confident, di&s;patched the billet
without the knowledge of Monimia, who&s;e health
was re&s;tored by the indefatigable care of the phy|&s;ician,
and the &s;age exhortations of the clergy|man,
by which &s;he was reconciled to life. In a
word, the villainy of Fathom had in&s;pired her
with &s;ome faint hope that Renaldo might &s;till be
innocent; and that notion contributed not a lit|tle
to her cure.</P>
<P>The letter having &s;o effectually an&s;wered their
warme&s;t hopes, in bringing back Renaldo &s;uch a
pattern of con&s;tancy and love; the confederates,
in con&s;equence of his enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;orrow, had
planned this meeting, as the mo&s;t intere&s;ting way
of re&s;toring two virtuous lovers to the arms of
each other; for which purpo&s;e the good clergy|man
had pitched upon his own church, and in|dulged
them with the u&s;e of the ve&s;try, in which
they now were pre&s;ented with a &s;mall but elegant
collation.</P>
<P>Melvile heard this &s;uccinct detail with equal
joy and admiration: he poured forth the dictates
of his gratitude to the pre&s;ervers of his happine&s;s:
&startq;This church, &s;aid he, &s;hall henceforth po&s;&s;e&s;s
a double &s;hare of my veneration; this holy man
will, I hope, fini&s;h the charitable work he has
begun, by tying tho&s;e bands of our happine&s;s,
which nought but death &s;hall have power to un|bind.&endq;
Then turning to that object which was
the &s;tar of his regard, &startq;Do I not over-rate, &s;aid
<PB N="253" REF="254">
he, my intere&s;t with the fair Monimia?&endq; She
made no verbal reply; but an&s;wered by an em|phatic
glance, more eloquent than all the power
of rhetorick and &s;peech. This language, which is
univer&s;al in the world of love, he perfectly well
under&s;tood, and in token of that faculty, &s;ealed
the a&s;&s;ent which &s;he had &s;miled, with a ki&s;s im|printed
on her poli&s;hed forehead.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e intere&s;ting ideas,
which, by being too long indulged, might have
endangered his rea&s;on, madame Clement intreat|ed
him to entertain the company with a detail of
what had happened to him in his la&s;t journey to
the empire, and Monimia expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of
knowing, in particular, the i&s;&s;ue of his conte&s;t
with count Treba&s;i, who, &s;he knew, had u&s;urped
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his father.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ollicited, he could not refu&s;e to gratify
their curio&s;ity and concern: he explained his ob|ligations
to the benevolent Jew; related the &s;teps
he had taken at Vienna for the recovery of his
inheritance; informed them of his happy ren|counter
with his father-in-law; of his &s;i&s;ter's de|liverance
and marriage; of the danger into which
his life had been precipitated by the news of Mo|nimia's
death; and, la&s;tly, of his adventure with
the banditti, in favour of a gentleman, who (he
afterwards under&s;tood) had been robbed in the
mo&s;t ba&s;e and barbarous manner by Fathom. He
likewi&s;e, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all pre&s;ent, and
of his mi&s;tre&s;s in particular, communicated &s;ome
circum&s;tances, which &s;hall appear in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Monimia's tender frame being quite fatigued
with the &s;cene &s;he had acted, and her mind over|whelmed
with the pro&s;perous tidings &s;he had heard,
after having joined the congratulations of the
<PB N="254" REF="255">
company, on the good fortune of her Renaldo,
begged leave to retire, that &s;he might by repo&s;e
recruit her exhau&s;ted &s;pirits; and the night being
pretty far &s;pent, &s;he was conducted by her lover
to madame Clement's coach, that &s;tood in wait|ing,
in which al&s;o the re&s;t of the company made
&s;hift to embark, and were carri&euml;d to the hou&s;e of
that good lady, where after they were invited to
dine, and Melvile intreated to bring don Diego
and the Jew along with them, they took leave
of one another, and retired to their re&s;pective
lodgings in a tran&s;port of joy and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>As for Renaldo, his rapture was &s;till mixed
with apprehen&s;ion, that all he had &s;een and heard
was no more than an un&s;ub&s;tantial vi&s;ion, rai&s;ed
by &s;ome gay delirium of a di&s;ordered imagination.
While his brea&s;t underwent tho&s;e violent, though
bli&s;sful emotions of joy and admiration, his friend
the Ca&s;tilian &s;pent the night in ruminating over
his own calamities, and in a &s;erious and &s;evere
review of his own conduct. He compared his
own behaviour with that of the young Hunga|rian,
and found him&s;elf &s;o light in the &s;cale, that
he &s;mote his brea&s;t with violence, exclaiming in
an agony of remor&s;e;</P>
<P>&startq;Count Melvile has rea&s;on to grieve; don
Diego to de&s;pair: his misfortunes flow from the
villainy of mankind; mine are the fruit of my
own madne&s;s: he laments the lo&s;s of a mi&s;tre&s;s,
who fell a &s;acrifice to the perfidious arts of a craf|ty
traitor: &s;he was beautiful, virtuous, accom|pli&s;hed,
and affectionate; he was fraught with
&s;en&s;ibility and love: doubtle&s;s, his heart mu&s;t
have deeply &s;uffered; his behaviour denotes the
keenne&s;s of his woe; his eyes are ever-flowing
fountains of tears; his bo&s;om the habitation of
<PB N="255" REF="256">
&s;ighs; five hundred leagues hath he mea&s;ured in
a pilgrimage to her tomb; nightly he vi&s;its the
dreary vault where &s;he now lies at re&s;t; her &s;olita|ry
grave is his couch; he conver&s;es with darkne&s;s
and the dead, until each lonely i&s;le re-echoes his
di&s;tre&s;s. What would be his penance, had he my
cau&s;e? were he con&s;cious of having murthered a
beloved wife and darling daughter! ah wretch!
ah cruel homicide! what had tho&s;e dear victims
done to merit &s;uch a fate? Were they not ever
gentle and obedient, ever aiming to give thee &s;a|tisfaction
and delight! Say, that Serafina was en|amoured
of a pea&s;ant; &s;ay, that &s;he had degene|rated
from the honour of her race: the inclina|tions
are involuntary; perhaps that &s;tranger was
her equal in pedigree and worth. Had they been
fairly que&s;tioned, they might have ju&s;tified,
at lea&s;t excu&s;ed that conduct which appeared &s;o
criminal; or had they owned the offence, and
&s;upplicated pardon: oh barbarous mon&s;ter that I
am! was all the hu&s;band; was all the father ex|tingui&s;hed
in my heart? how &s;hall my own errors
be forgiven, if I refu&s;ed to pardon the frailties of
my own blood; of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t dear to
my affection! Yet nature pleaded &s;trongly in their
behalf! my heart was bur&s;ting while I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
them to the &s;hades of death: I was maddened
with revenge! I was guided by that &s;avage prin|ciple
which fal&s;ely we call honour: accur&s;ed
phantome! that a&s;&s;umes the &s;pecious title, and
mi&s;leads our wretched nation! is it then honoura|ble
to &s;culk like an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and plunge the &s;ecret
dagger in the heart of &s;ome unhappy man, who
hath incurred my groundle&s;s jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion,
without indulging him with that opportunity
which the wor&s;t criminal enjoys? or is it ho|nourable
<PB N="256" REF="257">
to poi&s;on two defencele&s;s women, a
tender wife, an amiable daughter, whom even a
frown would almo&s;t have de&s;troyed! O! this is
cowardice, brutality, hell-born fury and revenge!
heaven hath not mercy to forgive &s;uch execrable
guilt. Who gave thee power, abandoned ruffian!
o'er the lives of tho&s;e whom God hath &s;tationed
as thy fellows of probation; o'er tho&s;e whom he
had &s;ent to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t thee; to &s;weeten all
thy cares, and &s;mooth the rough uneven paths of
life? O! I am doomed to never-cea&s;ing horror
and remor&s;e! if mi&s;ery can atone for &s;uch enor|mous
guilt, I have felt it in the extreme: like an
undying vulture it preys upon my heart; to &s;or|row
I am wedded; I hug that teeming con&s;ort
to my &s;oul; never, ah never &s;hall we part; for
&s;oon as my fame &s;hall &s;hine unclouded by the
charge of trea&s;on that now hangs over it, I will
devote my&s;elf to penitence and woe: a cold,
damp pavement &s;hall be my bed; my raiment
&s;hall be &s;ackcloth; the fields &s;hall furni&s;h herbage
for my food; the &s;tream &s;hall quench my thir&s;t;
the minutes &s;hall be numbered by my groans; the
night be privy to my &s;trains of &s;orrow, till hea|ven,
in pity to my &s;ufferings, relea&s;e me from the
penance I endure. Perhaps the &s;aints whom I
have murdered, will intercede for my remi&s;|&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>Such was the exerci&s;e of grief, in which the
haple&s;s Ca&s;tilian con&s;umed the night; he had not
yet con&s;igned him&s;elf to re&s;t, when Renaldo en|tering
his chamber, di&s;played &s;uch a gleam of
wildne&s;s and rapture in his countenance, as over|whelmed
him with amazement; for, till that mo|ment,
he had never &s;een his vi&s;age unob&s;cured
with woe. &startq;Pardon this abrupt intru&s;ion, my
<PB N="257" REF="258">
friend, cried Melvile, I could no longer with|hold
from your participation, the great, the un|expected
turn, which hath this night di&s;pelled all
my &s;orrows, and re&s;tored me to the fruition of
ineffable joy. Monimia lives! the fair, the ten|der,
the virtuous Monimia lives, and &s;miles upon
my vows! This night I retrieved her from the
grave: I held her in the&s;e arms; I pre&s;&s;ed her
warm, delicious lips to mine! O! I am giddy
with intolerable plea&s;ure!&endq;</P>
<P>Don Diego was confounded at this declara|tion,
which he con&s;idered as the effect of a di&s;|ordered
brain: he never doubted that Renaldo's
grief had at length overpowered his rea&s;on, and
that his words were the effect of mere frenzy.
While he mu&s;ed on this melancholy &s;ubject, the
count compo&s;ed his features, and, in a &s;uccinct
and well-connected detail, explained the whole
my&s;tery of his happine&s;s, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of the Spaniard, who &s;hed tears of &s;a|tisfaction,
and &s;training the Hungarian to his
brea&s;t, &startq;O my &s;on! &s;aid he, you &s;ee what re|compence
heaven hath in &s;tore for tho&s;e who pur|$$e
the paths of real virtue; tho&s;e paths from
which I my&s;elf have been fatally mi&s;led by a faith|le&s;s
vapour, which hath &s;educed my &s;teps, and left
me darkling in the aby&s;s of wretchedne&s;s. Such
as you de&s;cribe this happy fair, was once my Se|rafina,
rich in every grace of mind and body,
which nature could be&s;tow. Had it plea&s;ed heaven
to ble&s;s her with a lover like Renaldo! but no
more, the irrevocable &s;haft is fled: I will not
$aint your enjoyment with my unavailing &s;ighs!&endq;</P>
<P>Melvile a&s;&s;ured this di&s;con&s;olate father, that no
plea&s;ure, no avocation &s;hould ever &s;o entirely in|gro&s;s
his mind, but that he &s;hould &s;till find an
<PB N="258" REF="259">
hour for &s;ympathy and friend&s;hip: he communi|cated
the invitation of madame Clement, and in|&s;i&s;ted
upon his compliance, that he might have
an opportunity of &s;eeing and approving the
object of his pa&s;&s;ion. &startq;I can refu&s;e nothing to
the reque&s;t of count de Melvile, replied the Spa|niard,
and it were ungrateful in me to decline
the honour you propo&s;e. I own my&s;elf inflamed
with a de&s;ire of beholding a young lady, who&s;e
perfections I have &s;een reflected in your &s;orrow;
my curio&s;ity is, moreover, intere&s;ted on account
of that humane gentlewoman, who&s;e uncommon
genero&s;ity &s;heltered &s;uch virtue in di&s;tre&s;s; but
my di&s;po&s;ition is infectious, and will, I am afraid,
hang like a damp upon the general fe&s;tivity of
your friends.&endq;</P>
<P>Melvile would take no denial, and having ob|tained
his con&s;ent, repaired to the hou&s;e of
Jo&s;hua, who&s;e countenance &s;eemed to unbend
gradually, into a total expre&s;&s;ion of joy and &s;ur|prize,
as he learned the circum&s;tances of this
amazing event: he faithfully promi&s;ed to attend
the count at the appointed hour, and in the mean
time earne&s;tly exhorted him to take &s;ome repo&s;e,
in order to quiet the agitation of his &s;pirits, which
mu&s;t have been violently hurried on this occa&s;ion.
The advice was &s;alutary, and Renaldo re&s;olved to
follow it.</P>
<P>He returned to his lodgings, and laid him&s;elf
down; but, notwith&s;tanding the fatigue he had
undergone, &s;leep refu&s;ed to vi&s;it his eyelids, all
his faculties being kept in motion by the ideas
that crouded &s;o fa&s;t upon his imagination: never|thele&s;s,
though his mind continued in agitation,
his body was refre&s;hed, and he aro&s;e in the fore|noon,
with more &s;erenity and vigour than he had
<PB N="259" REF="260">
enjoyed for many months: every moment his
heart throbbed with new rapture, when he found
him&s;elf on the brink of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all that his &s;oul
held dear and amiable; he put on his gaye&s;t looks
and apparel; in&s;i&s;ted upon the Ca&s;tilian's doing
the &s;ame honour to the occa&s;ion; and the altera|tion
of dre&s;s produced &s;uch an advantageous
change in the appearance of don Diego, that when
Jo&s;hua arrived at the appointed hour, he could
&s;carce recognize his features, and complimented
him very politely on the improvement of his looks.</P>
<P>True it is, the Spaniard was a per&s;onage of a
very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing mein, and noble deportment;
and had not grief, by increa&s;ing his native gravi|ty,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;compo&s;ed the &s;ymmetry of
his countenance, he would have pa&s;&s;ed for a man
of a very amiable and engaging phy&s;iognomy.
They &s;et out in the Jew's coach for the hou&s;e of
madame Clement, and were u&s;hered into an apart|ment,
where they found the clergyman and phy|&s;ician
with that lady, to whom don Diego and the
Hebrew were by Melvile introduced.</P>
<P>Before they had &s;eated them&s;eves, Renaldo en|quired
about the health of Monimia, and was di|rected
to the next room by madame Clement,
who permited him to go thither, and conduct her
to the company. He was not &s;low in availing
him&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion: he di&s;appeared in an
in&s;tant, and, during his &s;hort ab&s;ence, don Diego
was &s;trangely di&s;turbed: the blood flu&s;hed, and
for&s;ook his cheeks by turns; a cold vapour &s;eem|ed
to &s;hiver through his nerves; and at his brea&s;t
he felt uncommon palpitation. Madame Cle|ment
ob&s;erved his di&s;compo&s;ure, and kindly en|quired
into the cau&s;e; when he replied, &startq;I have
&s;uch an intere&s;t in what concerns the count de
<PB N="260" REF="261">
Melvile, and my imagination is &s;o much prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
with the perfections of Monimia, that I am, as
it were, agonized with expectation; yet never
did my curio&s;ity before rai&s;e &s;uch tumults as tho&s;e
that now agitate my bo&s;om!&endq;</P>
<P>He had &s;carce pronounced the&s;e words, when
the door re-opening, Renaldo led in this mirror of
elegance and beauty, at &s;ight of whom the I&s;|raelite's
countenance was di&s;torted into a &s;tare of
admiration. But if &s;uch was the a&s;toni&s;hment of
Jo&s;hua, what were the emotions of the Ca&s;tilian,
when, in the beauteous orphan, he beheld the in|dividual
features of his long lo&s;t Serafina!</P>
<P>His feelings are not to be de&s;cribed: the &s;ond
parent, who&s;e affection &s;hoots even to a &s;en&s;e of
pain, feels not half &s;uch tran&s;port, when he un|expectedly
retrieves a darling child from the en|gulphing
billows or devouring flame. The hope
of Zelos had been totally extingui&s;hed: his heart
had been ince&s;&s;antly torn with angui&s;h and re|mor&s;e,
upbraiding him as the murtherer of Sera|fina.
His therefore were the additional tran&s;ports
of a father di&s;burthened of the guilt of &s;uch enor|mous
homicide. His nerves were too much over|powered
by this &s;udden recognition, to manife&s;t
the &s;en&s;ation of his &s;oul by external &s;igns. He
&s;tarted not, nor did he li&s;t an hand in token of
&s;urprize: he moved not from the &s;pot on which
he &s;tood, but, rivetting his eyes to tho&s;e of the
lovely phantome, remained without motion, un|til
&s;he, approaching with her lover, fell at his
feet, and cla&s;ping his knees, exclaimed, &startq;May
yet call you father?&endq;</P>
<P>This powerful &s;hock arrouzed his faculties; a
cold &s;weat bedewed his forehead; his knees be|gan
to tot$er; he dropped upon the floor, and
<PB N="261" REF="262">
throwing his arms around her, cried, &startq;O
nature! O Serafina! merciful providence! thy
ways are pa&s;t finding out&endq; So &s;aying, he fell
upon her neck, and wept aloud: the tears of
&s;ympathetic joy trickled down her &s;nowy bo&s;om,
that heaved with rapture inexpre&s;&s;ible. Renaldo's
eyes poured forth the briny &s;tream: the cheeks of
madame Clement were not dry in this conjunc|ture:
&s;he kneeled by Serafina, ki&s;&s;ed her with all
the eagerne&s;s of maternal affection, and with up|lifted
hands adored the power that pre-ordained
this ble&s;&s;ed event: the clergyman and doctor in|timately
&s;hared the general tran&s;port; and as for
Jo&s;hua, the drops of true benevolence flowed from
his eyes, like the oil on Aaron's beard, while he
&s;kipped about the room in an aukward extacy,
and in a voice re&s;embling the hoar&s;e notes of the
long-eared tribe, cried, &startq;O father Abraham!
&s;uch a moving &s;cene hath not been acted &s;ince
Jo&s;eph di&s;clo&s;ed him&s;elf unto his brethren in
Aegypt!&endq;</P>
<P>Don Diego having found utterance to his pa&s;|&s;ion,
procceded in this &s;train, &startq;O! my dear
child! to find thee thus again, after our la&s;t un|happy
parting, is wonderful! miraculous! Ble&s;&s;ed
be the all-good, almighty power, that &s;aved thee
for this hour of joy! Yet while my heart yearns
towards thee; while I pant with inconceivable
affection, and thus review the&s;e living features,
which were &s;o long my &s;tudy and delight, I dare
not a&s;k by what my&s;terious means this meeting is
effected; le&s;t, in the fond enquiry, I find my pre|&s;ent
bli&s;s unreal, and awake to mi&s;ery again!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O ever honoured father! &s;he replied, if to
&s;ee your Serafina at your feet, melting with filial
love and veneration, can impart a gleam of $$|tisfaction
<PB N="262" REF="263">
tisfaction to your brea&s;t, enjoy that plea&s;ure, and
behold her now re&s;tored to your protection and
paternal will, which &s;he never more will di&s;obey.
Alas! had heaven thought proper to re&s;erve ano|ther
parent for this interview, our joys had been
compleat; but &s;he hath already paid her debt to
nature, and from the feats of bli&s;s looks down
well plea&s;ed on this intere&s;ting &s;cene.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my Antonia! cried the father, inter|rupting
her, &s;he is then at re&s;t. Peace be to her
un&s;potted &s;oul; to have found her here, had been
too much: how my Serafina hath &s;urvived my
blindfold rage, I know not; but &s;ure the guilt of
fair Antonia's death, &s;till hangs upon my &s;oul.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;mi&s;s that fatal thought, &s;aid Serafina, my
mother quietly bade adieu to life in England; &s;he
peaceably expired within the&s;e arms, and with
her late&s;t breath prayed for her haple&s;s hu&s;band.&endq;
&startq;Her mind was ever godlike, he re&s;umed, &s;he
was a &s;aint in virtue, ill be&s;towed on &s;uch a
wretch as me; yet thy words have rai&s;ed a dread|ful
burthen from my con&s;cience: I am not then
the dire a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who &s;acrificed his wife and daugh|ter
to an infernal motive, fal&s;ely titled honour?
tho' I am more and more involved in a my&s;tery,
which I long to hear explained.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That &s;hall be my ta&s;k, cried Renaldo, but
fir&s;t permit me to implore your &s;anction to my
pa&s;&s;ion for the incomparable Serafina. You al|ready
know our mutual &s;entiments; and though
I own the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch ine&s;timable worth and
beauty, would be a recompence that infinitely
tran&s;cends the merit I can plead, yet as it hath
been my good fortune to in&s;pire her with a mu|tual
flame, I hope to reap from your indulgence,
what I could not expect from my own de&s;ert;
<PB N="263" REF="264">
and here we pre&s;ent our&s;elves, in hope of your
paternal a&s;&s;ent and benediction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Were &s;he more fair, and good, and gentle
than &s;he is, an&s;wered the Ca&s;tilian, (and to my
partial ob&s;ervation, nought e'er appeared on earth,
more beauteous and engaging) I would approve
your title to her heart, and recommend you to
her &s;miles, with all a father's influence and pow|er:
yes, my daughter! my joy on this occa&s;ion
is infinitely augmented by the knowledge of tho&s;e
tender ties of love that bind thee to this amiable
youth: a youth! to who&s;e uncommon courage
and genero&s;ity I owe my life and my &s;ub&s;i&s;tance,
together with the inexpre&s;&s;ible delight that now
revels in my bo&s;om. Enjoy, my children, the
happy fruits of your reciprocal attachment. May
heaven, which hath graciou&s;ly conducted you
through a labyrinth of perplexity and woe, to this
tran&s;porting view of bli$sful days, indulge you
with that uninterrupted &s;tream of pure felicity,
which is the hope, and ought to be the boon of
virtue, &s;uch as yours.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he joined their hands, and em|braced
them with the mo&s;t cordial love and &s;a|tisfaction,
which diffu&s;ed it&s;elf to every individual
of the company, who fervently invoked the Al|mighty
Power, in behalf of this enraptured
pair. The tumult of the&s;e emotions having a lit|tle
&s;ub&s;ided, and the Ca&s;tilian being &s;eated be|twixt
Renaldo and his beauteous bride, he politely
be&s;poke the indulgence of madame Clement,
begging &s;he would permit him to demand the
performance of the count's promi&s;e, that he might
be forthwith made acquainted with tho&s;e circum|&s;tances
of his own fate, which he was &s;o impa|tient
to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="265">
The lady having a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he and all
the company would take plea&s;ure in hearing the
recapitulation, the Spaniard, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to
Melvile, &startq;In the name of heaven! &s;aid he, how
could you &s;upplant that rival, who fell a &s;acrifice
to my re&s;entment, after he had bewitched the
heart of Serafina? for, &s;ure, the affection he had
kindled in her brea&s;t, mu&s;t have long &s;urvived
his death.&endq; &startq;That rival, replied the count,
who incurred your di&s;plea&s;ure, was no other than
Renaldo.&endq; With the&s;e words, he applied to one eye
a patch of black &s;ilk provided for the purpo&s;e, and
turning his face towards don Diego, that gentle|man
&s;tarted with a&s;toni&s;hment, crying, &startq;Good

I &s;lew! this is &s;till more amazing!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A retro&s;pective link, nece&s;&s;ary for the concatenation
of the&s;e memoirs.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;INdulge me with a patient hearing, proceeded
the Hungarian, and all the&s;e riddles &s;oon will
be explained. Inflamed with the de&s;ire of &s;eeing
foreign countries, I di&s;obeyed the will of an in|dulgent
father, from who&s;e hou&s;e withdrawing
privately, I &s;et out for Italy, in di&s;gui&s;e, by the
way of Tyrol, vi&s;ited Venice, Rome, Florence,
and embarking at Naples, in an Engli&s;h &s;hip,
arrived at St. Lucar, from whence I repaired to
Seville; there, in a few days, was my curio&s;ity
engaged by the &s;ame of the fair Serafina, who was
ju&s;tly deemed the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed beauty in
that part of Spain. Nay, blu&s;h not, gentle crea|ture!
for, by my hopes of heaven! thy charms
<PB N="265" REF="266">
were even injured by the cold applau&s;e of that
report: neverthele&s;s, I was warmly intere&s;ted by
the uncommon character, and cagerly longed to
&s;ee this pattern of perfection. As don Diego did
not train her up in that re&s;traint to which the
Spani&s;h ladies are &s;ubjected, I &s;oon found an op|portunity
of &s;eeing her at church; and no per&s;on
here pre&s;ent will, I pre&s;ume, doubt that I was
in&s;tantly captivated by her beauty and deportment.
Had I thought that don Diego's favour was un|engaged,
perhaps I &s;hould have followed the dic|tates
of vanity and inexperience, and pre&s;ented
my&s;elf in my own character, among the croud
of her profe&s;&s;ed admirers. I knew her father had
been an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and reputa|tion,
and did not doubt that he would have re|garded
a young &s;oldier of unexceptionable pedi|gree,
and I will even add, of unattainted fame:
nor did I &s;uppo&s;e my own father could have ob|jected
again&s;t &s;uch an advantageous match; but,
by dint of indu&s;trious enquiry, I learned, that the
divine Serafina was already betrothed to don Ma|nuel
de Mendoza, and this information over|whelmed
me with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>After having revolved a thou&s;and projects for
retarding and preventing that dete&s;ted union, I
re&s;olved to avail my&s;elf of my talent for drawing,
and profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf a ma&s;ter of that &s;cience, in
hope of being employed by the father of Serafina,
who, I knew, let &s;lip no opportunity of improv|ing
his daughter's education. Accordingly I had
the good fortune to attract his notice, was invited
to his hou&s;e, honoured with his approbation, and
furni&s;hed with unre&s;tricted opportunities of con|ver&s;ing
with the dear object of my love. The
pa&s;&s;ion which her beauty had kindled, was, by
<PB N="266" REF="267">
the perfections of her mind, inflamed to &s;uch a
degree of tran&s;port, as could not be concealed
from her penetration. She chanced to reli&s;h my
conver&s;ation; I gradually acquired her friend&s;hip;
pity was the next pa&s;&s;ion that &s;he entertained in
my favour. I then ventured to di&s;clo&s;e my&s;elf,
and the dear charmer did not di&s;approve of my
pre&s;umption. She and her mother had been per|plexed
with &s;ome religious &s;cruples, concerning
which they appealed to my opinion; and I was
happy enough to &s;et their minds at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of intercour&s;e naturally created a
mutual confidence among us; and, in a word, I
was ble&s;&s;ed with the daughter's love and mother's
approbation. Don Diego will pardon tho&s;e clan|de&s;tine
mea&s;ures which we took, from a full per|&s;ua&s;ion,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible to render him pro|pitious
to the views in which our hearts and hands
were &s;o deeply intere&s;ted: I did not then know
how little he was addicted to &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>Without entering into a detail of the &s;chemes
we projected to delay the happine&s;s of Mendoza,
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that knowing the fatal day
was, at length, unalterably fixed, we determined
to elude the purpo&s;e of don Diego by flight, and
every thing was actually prepared for our e&s;cape.
When the hour of appointment arrived, I repair|ed
to the place at which I had propo&s;ed to enter
the hou&s;e, and &s;tumbled, in the dark, over the
body of a man &s;till warm and bleeding. Alarmed
at this occurrence, I darted my&s;elf through the
window, and ru&s;hing to the apartment of the
ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerle&s;s
Serafina, and her virtuous mother, &s;tretched
on a couch, and in all appearance deprived of
life.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
The company will ea&s;ily conceive what ago|nies
I felt at &s;uch a &s;pectacle. I ran towards the
&s;pot in a tran&s;port of horror! I cla&s;ped my lovely
mi&s;tre&s;s in my arms, and finding her &s;till breath|ing,
endeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from
the trance: Antonia was overwhelmed with the
&s;ame lethargic power. My fancy was imme|diately
&s;truck with the apprehen&s;ion of their be|ing
poi&s;oned. Regardle&s;s of my own &s;ituation, I
alarmed the family, called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and re|que&s;ted
the &s;ervants to &s;ummon don Diego to the
di&s;mal &s;cene. I was informed, that their ma&s;ter
had rode forth in manife&s;t confu&s;ion; and while
I pondered on this &s;urpri&s;ing excur&s;ion, an apo|thecary
in the neighbourhood entered the cham|ber,
and having examined the pul&s;es of the ladies,
declared, that their lives were in no danger, and
advi&s;ed that they &s;hould be undre&s;&s;ed and conveyed
to bed. While their women were bu&s;ied in this
employment, I went into the court-yard, attend|ed
by &s;ome of the &s;ervants with lights, in order
to view the body of the man, which I had found
at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his coun|tenance
ferocious, a long &s;pado was buckled to his
thigh, and in his belt were &s;tuck a brace of loaded
pi&s;tols; &s;o that we concluded he was &s;ome thief,
who had waited for an opportunity, and &s;eeing
the ca&s;ement open, intended to rob the hou&s;e, but
was prevented and &s;lain by don Diego him&s;elf,
who&s;e retreat, however, did not a little confound
our conjecture. For my own part, I remained
all night in the hou&s;e, tortured with fear, vexa|tion,
and &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>My hope was altogether di&s;appointed by this
unhappy accident, and I &s;huddered at the pro|&s;pect
of lo&s;ing Serafina for ever, either by this

my&s;terious malady, or by her marriage with Men|doza,
which I now de&s;paired of being able to de|feat.
The major-domo having waited &s;everal
hours for his lord's return, without &s;eeing him
appear, thought proper to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to
don Manuel, with an account of what had hap|pened;
and that nobleman arriving in the morn|ing,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e. About four
o'clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to &s;tir,
and at five, &s;he and her mother were perfectly
awake.</P>
<P>They no &s;ooner recovered the u&s;e of reflection,
than they gave &s;igns of equal &s;orrow and amaze|ment,
and earne&s;tly called for I&s;abella, who was
privy to our de&s;ign, and who, after a very minute
enquiry, was found in a lone and &s;olitary cham|ber,
where &s;he had been confined. Such was the
confu&s;ion of the hou&s;e, that no per&s;on ever dream|ed
of a&s;king how I had entered, each dome&s;tick,
in all probability, &s;uppo&s;ing that I had been in|troduced
by his fellow: &s;o that I tarried unque&s;|tioned,
on pretence of concern for the di&s;tre&s;s of
a family, in which I had been &s;o generou&s;ly en|tertained;
and by I&s;abella &s;ent my re&s;pects and
duty to her ladies: &s;he was therefore not a little
&s;urprized, when, after every other &s;ervant had
withdrawn, &s;he heard the lovely Serafina exclaim,
with all the violence of grief, &startq;Ah! I&s;abella,
Orlando is no more!&endq; but their a&s;toni&s;hment
was &s;till greater, when &s;he a&s;&s;ured them of my
being alive, and in the hou&s;e. They recounted
to her the adventure of la&s;t night, which &s;he ex|plained
by informing them of the letters which
don Diego had intercepted: and they immediate|ly
concluded, that he had, in the precipitation of
his wrath, killed, by mi&s;take, the per&s;on who
<PB N="269" REF="270">
was found dead in the court-yard. This conjec|ture
alarming them on my account, they, by the
medium of I&s;abella, conjured me to leave the
hou&s;e, le&s;t don Diego &s;hould return, and accom|pli&s;h
his re&s;entment; and I was per&s;uaded to
withdraw, after I had &s;ettled the channel of a
corre&s;pondence with the confidante.</P>
<P>Being now obliged to alter our mea&s;ures, be|cau&s;e
our former intention was di&s;covered by don
Diego, I &s;ecured a retreat for Serafina and her
mother, at the hou&s;e of the Engli&s;h con&s;ul in Se|ville,
who was my particular friend; and next
day under&s;tanding, from I&s;abella, that her lord
had not yet re-appeared, and that don Manuel
was very urgent in his addre&s;&s;es, we concerted
an a&s;&s;ignation in the garden, and that &s;ame even|ing
I was fortunate enough to convey my prize
to the a&s;ylum I had prepared for their reception.
Inexpre&s;&s;ible was the rage of Mendoza, when
he heard of their elopement: he raved like one
deprived of rea&s;on, &s;wore he would put all the
&s;ervants of the family to the rack, and in con&s;e|quence
of the intelligence he obtained by threats
and promi&s;es, &s;et on foot a very &s;trict enquiry,
in order to apprehend the fugitives and Orlando,
who had, by &s;ome means or other, incurred his
&s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>We eluded his &s;earch by the vigilance and cau|tion
of our kind ho&s;t; and while we remained in
concealment, were extremely a&s;toni&s;hed to hear,
that the unfortunate don Diego was proclaimed a
traitor, and a price &s;et upon his head. This in|formation
overwhelmed us all with the utmo&s;t
affliction: Antonia lamented, without cea&s;ing, the
di&s;grace of her beloved lord, from whom &s;he ne|ver
would have withdrawn her&s;elf, but with the
<PB N="270" REF="271">
lively hope of a reconciliation, after the fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of his ire &s;hould have &s;ub&s;ided, and the
real character of Orlando &s;hould have appeared:
it was not long before we had rea&s;on to believe,
that Mendoza was the accu&s;er of don Diego.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, &s;tart not, Signior; Manuel was actually
that traitor: this was the turn of his revenge;
when he found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in the hope
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the incomparable Serafina, he took a
ba&s;e advantage of your ab&s;ence and retreat. He
po&s;ted to Madrid, impeached you to the &s;ecreta|ry
of &s;tate, of having maintained a criminal cor|re&s;pondence
with the enemies of Spain, included
me in his accu&s;ation, as a &s;py for the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, and framed &s;uch a plau&s;ible tale from the
circum&s;tances of your di&s;tre&s;s, that don Diego was
outlawed, and Mendoza gratified with a grant of
his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e melancholy incidents made a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon the mind of the virtuous Antonia,
who, waving every other con&s;ideration, would
have per&s;onally appeared for the vindication of
her hu&s;band's honour, had not we di&s;&s;uaded her
from &s;uch a ra&s;h undertaking, by demon&s;trating
her inability to contend with &s;uch a powerful an|tagoni&s;t,
and repre&s;enting, that her appearance
would be infallibly attended with the ruin of
Serafina, who would certainly fall into the hands
of the villain to whom &s;he had been contracted.
We exhorted her to wait patiently for &s;ome happy
revolution of fortune, and encouraged her with
the hope of don Diego's exerting him&s;elf effec|tually
in his own defence.</P>
<P>Mean while, our worthy landlord was &s;uddenly
$ut off by death; and his widow being re&s;olv$$
to retire into her own country, we &s;ecretly em|barked
<PB N="271" REF="272">
in the &s;ame &s;hip, and arrived in England
about eighteen months ago. Antonia &s;till continued
to pine over the ruin of her hou&s;e; as &s;he could
hear no tidings of Don Diego, &s;he concluded he
was dead, and mourned with unabating &s;orrow.
In vain I a&s;&s;ured her that &s;oon as my own affairs
&s;hould be adju&s;ted, I would exert my whole en|deavours
to find and &s;uccour him. She could
not imagine that a man of his &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition
would live &s;o long in ob&s;curity; and her afflic|tion
derived new force from the death of the
con&s;ul's widow, with whom &s;he had lived in the
mo&s;t unbounded intimacy and friend&s;hip. From
that day her health evidently declined: &s;he fore|&s;aw
her di&s;&s;olution and comforted her&s;elf with the
hope of &s;eeing her husband and her friend, in
a place where no treachery is felt, and no &s;or|row
is known; confident of my integrity, and the
purity of my love, &s;he in the mo&s;t pathetic
terms recommended Serafina to my care.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ha! weepe&s;t thou, fair excellence, at the re|membrance
of that tender &s;cene, when the good
Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy &s;oft hand
to mine, and &s;aid, &startq;Renaldo, I bequeath this
orphan to your love; it is a &s;acred pledge which
if you cheri&s;h with due honour and regard,
internal peace and happine&s;s will ever &s;mile with|in
your bo&s;om: but if you treat it with indiffe|rence,
di&s;honour or neglect, ju&s;t heaven will
puni&s;h your breach of tru&s;t with everla&s;ting di&s;|appointments
and di&s;quiet.&endq;</P>
<P>Signior Don Diego, I &s;ee you are moved, and
therefore will not dwell on &s;uch di&s;tre&s;sful cir|cum&s;tances.
The excellent Antonia exchanged
this life for a more happy &s;tate; and &s;o exqui&s;ite
was the &s;orrow of the tender-hearted Serafina, as
<PB N="272" REF="273">
to torture me with the apprehen&s;ion that &s;he
would not long &s;urvive her pious mother. How
I obeyed the injunctions of that departing &s;aint,
Monimia (for that name &s;he now a&s;&s;umed) can
te&s;tify, until that artful &s;erpent Fathom glided
into our mutual confidence, abu&s;ed our ears, poi|&s;oned
our un&s;u&s;pecting faith, and effected that
fatal breach, productive of all the mi&s;ery and vexa|tion
which we have &s;uffered, and which is now
&s;o happily expelled.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Heaven, &s;aid the Ca&s;tilian, hath vi&s;ited me
for the &s;ins and errors of my youth; yet, &s;uch
mercy hath been mingled with its cha&s;ti&s;ements,
I dare not murmur or repine. The tears of pe|ni$ence
and &s;orrow &s;hall water my Antonia's
grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,
by which the obligation of my promi&s;e is cancelled,
and my honour fully acquitted. He &s;hall not
triumph in his guilt: my &s;ervices, my character
and innocence &s;hall &s;oon confront his perfidy, and
I hope, de&s;eat his intere&s;t: The king is ju&s;t and
gracious, nor is my family and name unknown.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the Jew interpo&s;ing, pre&s;ented to him a
letter from a per&s;on of con&s;equence at Madrid,
whom Jo&s;hua had intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of don
Diego; that nobleman had already found means
to repre&s;ent the ca&s;e of Zelos to his maje&s;ty,
who had actually ordered don Manuel to be
confined, until the injured per&s;on &s;hould appear
to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and pro&s;ecute his accu&s;er ac|cording
to the terms of law: at the &s;ame time
don Diego was &s;ummoned to pre&s;ent him&s;elf
before the king within a limited time, to an&s;wer
to the charge which Mendoza had brought a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">
The Spaniard's heart overflow'd with gratitude
and joy, when he read this intimation; he em|braced
the Jew, who, before Zelos could give
utterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spa|ni&s;h
Amba&s;&s;ador at London, having been pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in his favour, craved the honour of &s;eeing
don Diego; and that he, Jo&s;hua, was ready to
conduct them to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Then is my heart at re&s;t! (cried the Ca&s;ti|lian)
the hou&s;e of Zelos once more &s;hall lift up
its head. I &s;hall again revi&s;it my native coun|try
with honour, and aba&s;e the villain who
hath &s;oiled my fame! O my children! this day
is replete with &s;uch joy and &s;atisfaction, as I did
not think had been in the power of heaven to
grant, without the interpo&s;ition of a miracle!
To you Renaldo, to you illu&s;trious lady, and to
the&s;e worthy gentlemen, am I indebted for the re|&s;toration
of that for which alone I wi&s;h to live,
and when my heart cea&s;es to retain the obligation,
may I forfeit the name of a Ca&s;tilian, and
&s;corn and di&s;honour be my portion.&endq;</P>
<P>Perhaps all Europe could not produce another
company &s;o happy as that which now &s;at down
to dinner in the hou&s;e of madame Clement,
who&s;e own benevolent heart was peculiarly adapt|ed
for &s;uch enjoyment. The lovers $ea&s;ted
their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender
intercour&s;e of glances, which needed not the
&s;low interpretation of &s;peech; while the Spa|niard
regarded them alternately with looks of
wonder and paternal joy, and every individual
&s;urveyed the all-de&s;erving pair with admiration
and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Serafina taking the advantage of this general
&s;atisfaction, when the heart &s;oftened into com|placency,
<PB N="274" REF="275">
depo&s;its every violent thought: &startq;I
mu&s;t now, (&s;aid &s;he) try my intere&s;t with Renaldo:
the good company &s;hall bear witne&s;s to my tri|umph
or repul&s;e. I do not a&s;k you to forgive,
but to withold your vengeance from the wretched
Fathom. His fraud, ingratitude and villainy are,
I believe, unrivalled: yet his ba&s;e de&s;igns have
been defeated; and heaven perhaps hath made
him the involuntary in&s;trument for bringing our
con&s;tancy and virtue to the te&s;t; be&s;ides, his per|fidy
is already puni&s;hed with the la&s;t degree of
human mi&s;ery and di&s;grace: the Doctor, who has
traced him in all his conduct and vici&s;&s;itudes of
fortune, will draw a picture of his pre&s;ent wretch|edne&s;s,
which, I doubt not, will move your com|pa&s;&s;ion,
as it hath already excited mine.&endq;</P>
<P>The generous ho&s;te&s;s was ready to enforce this
charitable propo&s;al, with all her eloquence,
when Melvile with a look that well expre&s;&s;ed
his magnanimity of love, replied, &startq;Such a boon
becomes the gentle Serafina. O! every moment
furni&s;hes me with fre&s;h matter to admire the vir|tues
of thy &s;oul: if thou, who&s;e tender heart hath
been &s;o rent with mi&s;ery and angui&s;h, can&s;t in|tercede
for thy tormentor, who now &s;uffers in
his turn, &s;hall I refu&s;e to pardon the mi&s;erable
wretch! no, let me glory in imitating the great
example, and &s;ollicit Don Diego in behalf of the
&s;ame mi&s;creant who&s;e perfidious barbarity co&s;t
him &s;uch intolerable woe.&endq; Enough, cried the
Ca&s;tilian, I have di&s;claimed the vindictive prin|ciples
of a Spaniard; and leave the mi&s;erable ob|ject
to the &s;ting of his own con&s;cience, which
&s;oon or late, will not fail to avenge the wrongs
we have &s;u&s;tained from his deceit.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Hi&s;tory draws near a Period.</HEAD>
<P>UNiver&s;al was the applau&s;e which they ac|quired
by this noble &s;acrifice of their re|&s;entment:
the afternoon was &s;pent in the utmo&s;t
harmony and good humour; and at the earne&s;t
&s;olicitation of Renaldo, who&s;e fancy &s;till har|boured
the apprehen&s;ions of another &s;eparation,
don Diego con&s;ented that the indi&s;&s;oluble knot
&s;hould be tied between that young gentleman
and Serafina in two days, and the place ap|pointed
for the ceremony, was the very church
where they had been re&s;tored to the arms of
each other.</P>
<P>The lovely bride, with a &s;ilent blu&s;h that &s;et
her lover's heart on fire, &s;ubmitted to this deter|mination,
in con&s;equence of which, the com|pany
was be&s;poke for that au&s;picious hour, and
the evening being pretty far advanced, they took
leave of the ladies, and retired to their re&s;pective
homes; don Diego and his future &s;on in law
being reconducted to their lodgings, in the coach
of the Jew, who taking an opportunity of being
alone with Melvile, ob&s;erved that it would be
nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion to &s;upply the Ca&s;tilian
with a &s;um of money, in order to &s;upport his
dignity and independence, in furni&s;hing Serafina
with every thing &s;uitable to her rank and merit;
and that he would willingly accommodate him,
provided he knew how to propo&s;e it &s;o as to give
no offence to his punctilious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Renaldo thanking him for this generous anti|cipation,
advi&s;ed him to &s;ollicit the Spaniard's
<PB N="276" REF="277">
corre&s;pondence in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to
put the whole on the footing of his own in|tere&s;t;
by which means don Diego's delicacy
could &s;u&s;tain no affront. Fraught with this in|&s;truction,
the I&s;raelite de&s;ired a private audience
of the Ca&s;tilian, in which after an apology for
the freedom of his demand, &startq;Signior don Diego,
(&s;aid he) as your fortune hath been &s;o long em|bezzled
by your adver&s;ary in Spain, and your
corre&s;pondence with that country intirely cut
off, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that your finances
are at pre&s;ent in &s;uch a condition, as to main|tain
the &s;plendour of your family. Count de
Melvile's whole fortune is at your command;
and had not he been afraid of giving umbrage
to the peculiar delicacy of your &s;entiments,
he would have pre&s;&s;ed you to u&s;e it for your
convenience. For my own part, over and a|bove
the inclination I have to &s;erve don Diego,
I con&s;ult my own private advantage in de&s;iring
you to accept my &s;ervice on this occa&s;ion.
Money is the chief commodity in which I deal,
and if you honour me with your commands,
I &s;hall be a gainer by my obedience.&endq;</P>
<P>Don Diego replied with a &s;mile that denoted
how well he under&s;tood the meaning of this ad|dre&s;s;
&startq;Surely, Signior, I am bound by the
&s;tronge&s;t ties, to exert my utmo&s;t endeavours
for your advantage; and I pray God this your
propo&s;al may have that i&s;&s;ue: I am well ac|quainted
with the Count's genero&s;ity and re|$ined
notions of honour; and too much obliged
by him already, to he&s;itate with punctilious re|&s;erve
in accepting his future a&s;&s;i&s;tance: never|thele&s;s,
&s;ince you have contrived a &s;cheme for
removing all &s;cruples of that &s;ort, I &s;hall execute
<PB N="277" REF="278">
t with plea&s;ure; and in the form of bu&s;ine&s;s,
you &s;hall have all the &s;ecurity I can give for
what &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer my pre&s;ent
occa&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P>The preliminaries being thus &s;ettled, Jo&s;hua
advanced for his u&s;e a thou&s;and pounds, for which
he would take neither bond, note nor receipt,
de&s;iring only that the Ca&s;tilian would mark it
in his own pocket book, that the debt might ap|pear,
in ca&s;e any accident &s;hould befal the bor|rower.
Although the Spaniard had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to the uncommon genero&s;ity of Mel|vile,
he could not help wondering at this noble|ne&s;s
of behaviour, &s;o little to be expected from
any merchant, much le&s;s from a Jewi&s;h broker.</P>
<P>While this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo
who could no longer withhold the communication
of his happine&s;s from his &s;i&s;ter and relations in
Germany, took up the pen, and in a letter to
his brother in law, recounted all the circum&s;tan|ces
of the &s;urprizing turn of fate which he had
experienced &s;ince his arrival in England: he
likewi&s;e related the &s;tory of don Diego, informed
them of the day appointed for his nuptials, and
intreated the major to make a journey to Lon|don
with his wife; or if that &s;hould be imprac|ticable,
to come as far as Bru&s;&s;els, where they
&s;hould be met by him and his Serafina. There
was now but one day between him and the
accompli&s;hment of his deare&s;t wi&s;h, and that was
&s;pent in procuring a licen&s;e, and adju&s;ting the
preparations for the grand fe&s;tival. Don Diego
in the forenoon vi&s;ited madame Clement, to
whom he repeated his warm acknowledgments
of her bounty and maternal affection to his daugh|ter,
and pre&s;ented to Serafina, bank notes to
<PB N="278" REF="279">
the amount of five hundred pounds, to defray
the nece&s;&s;ary expence of her wedding orna|ments.</P>
<P>All the previous &s;teps being taken for the
&s;olemnization of this intere&s;ting event, and the
hour of appointment arrived, the bridegroom,
accompanied by his father in law, ha&s;tened to
the place of rendezvous, which was the ve&s;try
room of the church we have already de&s;cribed;
where they were received by the good clergy|man
in his canonicals; and here they had not
waited many minutes, when they were joined
by madame Clement and the amiable bride, e&s;|corted
by the friendly phy&s;ician, who had all
along bore &s;uch a &s;hare in their concerns. Sera|fina
was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ack of white &s;attin, and
the ornaments of her head were adju&s;ted in
the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion, which gave a peculiar air
to her appearance, and an additional &s;pirit to
tho&s;e attractions which engaged the heart of each
beholder. There was nothing remarkable in
the habit of Renaldo, who had copied the plain|ne&s;s
and elegance of his mi&s;tre&s;s; but when
&s;he entered the place, his features were animat|ed
with a double proportion of vivacity, and
their eyes meeting, &s;eemed to kindle a blaze
which diffu&s;ed warmth and joy thro' the coun|tenances
of all pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e her father led her to the
altar, and gave her away to the tran&s;ported
Renaldo, before the prie&s;t who performed the
ceremony, and be&s;towed the nuptial benediction
on this enraptured pair. The &s;anction of the
church being thus obtained, they withdrew into
the ve&s;try, where Melvile &s;ealed his title on her
ro&s;y lips, and pre&s;ented his wife to the company,
<PB N="279" REF="280">
who embraced her in their turns, with fervent
wi&s;hes for their mutual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho' the &s;cene of this tran&s;action was remote
from any inhabited neighbourhood, the church
was &s;urrounded by a crowd of people, who with
uncommon demon&s;trations of &s;urprize and ad|miration,
petitioned heaven to ble&s;s &s;o fair a
couple. Such indeed was their eagerne&s;s to &s;ee
them, that &s;ome lives were endangered by the
pre&s;&s;ure of the crowd, which attended them with
loud acclamation to the coach, after the brim|groom
had depo&s;ited in the hands of the mini&s;ter,
one hundred pounds for the benefit of the poor
of that pari&s;h, and thrown &s;everal handfuls of
money among the multitude. Serafina reim|barked
in madame Clement's convenience, with
that good lady and don Diego, while Renaldo
with the clergyman and doctor followed in
Jo&s;hua's coach, to a plea&s;ant country hou&s;e upon
the Thames, at the di&s;tance of a few miles from
London. This the Jew had borrowed from
the owner, for a few days, and there they were
received by that hone&s;t Hebrew, who had pro|vided
a very elegant entertainment for the occa|&s;ion:
he had al&s;o be&s;poke a &s;mall but excellent
band of mu&s;ick, which regaled their ears while
they &s;at at dinner; aud the afternoon being calm
and &s;erene, he prevailed on them to take the
air on the river, in a barge which he had pre|pared
for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this diver&s;ity of amu&s;e|ment,
Renaldo would have found it the longe&s;t
day he had ever pa&s;&s;ed, had not his imagina|tion
been diverted by an incident which em|ployed
his attention during the remaining part
of the evening. They had drank tea, and en|gaged
<PB N="280" REF="281">
in a party at whi&s;t, when they were &s;ur|prized
with a noi&s;e of contention from a pub|lick
hou&s;e, that fronted the windows of the a|partment
in which they &s;at. Alarmed at this
uproar, they for&s;ook their cards, and throwing
up the ca&s;ements, beheld a hear&s;e &s;urrounded
by four men on hor&s;eback, who had &s;topped the
carriage and violently pulled the driver from his
&s;eat. This uncommon arre&s;t had engaged the
curio&s;ity of the publican's family, who &s;tood at
the door to ob&s;erve the con&s;equence, when all
of a &s;udden, appeared a per&s;on in canonicals, well
mounted, who riding up to tho&s;e who maltreated
the driver, be&s;towed upon one of them, &s;uch a
blow with the but-end of his whip, as laid him
&s;prawling on the ground, and &s;pringing from his
&s;addle upon the box, took the reins into his
own hand, &s;wearing with great vehemence, that
he would murther every man who &s;hould at|tempt
to ob&s;truct the hear&s;e.</P>
<P>The good prie&s;t who had married Renaldo,
was not a little &s;candalized at this ferocious be|haviour
in a clergyman, and could not help
&s;aying aloud, he was a di&s;grace to the cloth;
when the hor&s;eman looking up to the window,
replied, &startq;Sir, may I be d&mdash;n'd if any man
in England has a greater re&s;pect for the cloth
than I have; but at pre&s;ent I am quite di&s;tract|ed.&endq;
So &s;aying, he whipped up the hor&s;es,
and had actually di&s;entangled the hear&s;e from
tho&s;e who &s;urrounded it; when he was oppo&s;ed
by another troop, one of whom alighted with
great expedition, and cut the harne&s;s &s;o as that
he could not po&s;&s;ibly proceed: finding him&s;elf
thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground,
and exerci&s;ed his weapon with &s;uch amazing
<PB N="281" REF="282">
&s;trength and agility, that &s;everal of his antago|ni&s;ts
were left motionle&s;s on the field, before he
was overpowered and di&s;armed by dint of num|bers,
who a&s;&s;ailed him on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The mad par&s;on being thus taken pri&s;oner, an
elderly per&s;on of a very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance,
went up to the hear&s;e, and unbolting the $oor,
a young lady &s;prung out, and &s;hri$king, ran di|rectly
to the public hou&s;e, to the infinite a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and affright of the whole family, who be|lieved
it was the &s;pirit of the decea&s;ed per&s;on,
who&s;e body lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who
was with difficulty re&s;trained from interpo&s;ing in
behalf of the clergyman again&s;t &s;uch odds, no
&s;ooner perceived this apparition, than &s;uppo&s;ing
her to be &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;el, his Quixoti&s;m
awoke, he de&s;cended in an in&s;tant, and ru&s;hed
into the hou&s;e, among tho&s;e who pur&s;ued the fair
phantome. Don Diego and the phy&s;ician took
the &s;ame road, while the real clergyman and Jo|&s;hua
tarried with the ladies, who were, by this
time, very much intere&s;ted in the event.</P>
<P>Melvile found the young lady in the hands of the
old gentleman, who had relea&s;ed her from the hear&s;e,
and who now bitterly upbraided her for her folly,
and di&s;obedience: while &s;he prote&s;ted, with great
vivacity, that whatever &s;he might &s;uffer from his
&s;everity, &s;he would never &s;ubmit to the hateful
match he had propo&s;ed, nor break the promi&s;e
&s;he had already made to the gentleman who had
now attempted to re&s;cue her from the tyranny of
a cruel father. This declaration was followed
by a plentiful &s;hower of tears, which the father
could not behold with unmoi&s;tened eyes, altho'
he reviled her with marks of uncommon di&s;|plea&s;ure,
and turning to the count, &startq;I appeal to
<PB N="282" REF="283">
you, Sir, &s;aid he, whether I have not rea&s;on to
cur&s;e the undutiful ob&s;tinacy of that pert baggage,
and renounce her for ever as an alien to my
blood. She has, for &s;ome months, been &s;ollicited
in marriage by an hone&s;t citizen, a thirty thou|&s;and
pound man; and in&s;tead of li&s;tening to &s;uch
an advantageous propo&s;al, &s;he hath be&s;towed her
heart upon a young fellow, not worth a groat.
Ah! you degenerate hu&s;&s;y, this comes of your
plays and romances: if thy mother were not a
woman of an unexceptionable life and conver&s;a|tion,
I &s;hould verily believe thou art no child of
mine: run away with a beggar! for &s;hame!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;uppo&s;e, replied Renaldo, the per&s;on to
whom your daughter's affection inclines, is that
clergyman who exerted him&s;elf &s;o manfully at the
door.&endq; &startq;Clergyman! cried the other, adad!
he has more of the devil than the church about
him. A ruffian! he has, for ought I know,
murthered the worthy gentleman whom I intend|ed
for my &s;on-in-law; and the rogue, if I had
not kept out of his way, would, I &s;uppo&s;e, have
&s;erved me with the &s;ame &s;auce: me! who have
been his ma&s;ter for many years, and had re&s;olved
to make a man of him. Sir, he was my own
clerk, and this is the return I have met with
from the &s;erpent which I cheri&s;hed in my bo|&s;om.&endq;</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the arrival of
the citizen for whom he had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch con|cern:
that gentleman had received a contu&s;ion
upon one eye, by which the &s;ight was altogether
ob&s;tructed; &s;o that he concluded he &s;hould never
retrieve the u&s;e of that organ, and with great
clamour took all the &s;pectators to witne&s;s the in|$ury
he had &s;u&s;tained; he entered the room with
<PB N="283" REF="284">
manife&s;t perturbation, demanded &s;atisfaction of
the father, and peremptorily declared it &s;hould
not be a lo&s;t eye to him, if there was law in Eng|land.
This un&s;ea&s;onable demand, and the boi|&s;terous
manner in which it was made, did not at
all &s;uit the pre&s;ent humour of the old gentleman,
who told him peevi&s;hly he owed him no eye, and
bade him go and a&s;k reparation of the per&s;on who
had done him wrong.</P>
<P>The young lady &s;natching this favourable oc|ca&s;ion,
earne&s;tly entreated Melvile and his com|pany
to intercede with her father in behalf of her
lover, who, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, was a young gen|tleman
of a good family, and uncommon merit;
and, in compliance with her reque&s;t, they in|vited
him and his daughter to the hou&s;e in which
they lodged, where they would be di&s;incumbered
of the croud which this di&s;pute had gathered to|gether,
and more at lei&s;ure to con&s;ult about the
mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to be taken. The old gentle|man
thanked them for their courte&s;y, which he
did not think proper to refu&s;e, and while he led,
or rather hauled mademoi&s;elle over the way, un|der
the au&s;pices of the Ca&s;tilian, Renaldo &s;et the
lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good
offices, and advi&s;ed him to wait at the public hou&s;e
for an happy i&s;&s;ue of their negotiation.</P>
<P>The p&s;eudo-par&s;on was very much affected by
this generous proffer, for which he made &s;uitable
acknowledgments, and prote&s;ted before God, he
would die a thou&s;and deaths, rather than part
with his dear Charlotte. Her father no &s;ooner
entered the apartment, than he was known by
Jo&s;hua to be a con&s;iderable trader in the city of
London, and the merchant was glad to find him|&s;elf
among his acquaintance. He was &s;o full of
<PB N="284" REF="285">
the &s;tory which had brought him thither, that he
had &s;carce &s;at down, when he began to complain
of his hard &s;ate, in having an only child, who
was &s;o mean, &s;tubborn and contumacious; and
every &s;entence was concluded with an apo&s;trophe
of reproaches to the delinquent.</P>
<P>The Jew having allowed him to ring out his
alarm, condoled his misfortune, and gravely coun|&s;elled
the young lady to wean her affections from
&s;uch an unworthy object: for he &s;uppo&s;ed her fa|vourite
was a man of no principle, or liberal en|dowments,
otherwi&s;e her father would not ex|claim
&s;o bitterly again&s;t her conduct. Charlotte,
who wanted neither beauty nor under&s;tanding,
a&s;&s;ured him, that her lover's character was, in all
re&s;pects, unblemi&s;hed; for the truth of which
a&s;&s;ertion &s;he appealed to her papa, who owned,
with reluctance, that the young man was a gen|tleman
by birth, that he had &s;erved him with re|markable
diligence and integrity, and that his ac|compli&s;hments
were far &s;uperior to his &s;tation in
life. &startq;But then, &s;aid he, the fellow has not a
&s;hilling of his own, and would you have me give
away my daughter to a beggar?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;God forbid! cried the Jew, I always un|der&s;tood
you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ample fortune, and am
&s;orry to find it otherwi&s;e.&endq; &startq;Otherwi&s;e! re|plied
the citizen, with &s;ome acrimony, take care
what you &s;ay, Sir, a merchant's credit is not to
be tampered with.&endq; &startq;I beg your pardon, an|&s;wered
the Hebrew, I concluded that your cir|cum&s;tances
were bad, becau&s;e you objected to
the poverty of the young man, after you had
owned he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every other qualifica|tion
to make your daughter happy: for it is not
to be imagined, that you would thwart her in|clinations,
<PB N="285" REF="286">
or &s;eek to render an only child mi&s;era|ble,
on account of an ob&s;$acle which you your&s;elf
could ea&s;ily remove. Let us &s;uppo&s;e you can
afford to give with your daughter ten thou&s;and
pounds, which would enable this young man to
live with credit and reputation, and engage ad|vantageou&s;ly
in trade, for which you &s;ay he is well
qualified: The alternative then will be, whe|ther
you would rather &s;ee her in the arms of a
de&s;erving youth, whom &s;he loves, enjoying all
the comforts of life, with a moderate fortune,
which it will always be in your own power to
improve; or tied for life to a monied man, whom
&s;he dete&s;ts, cur&s;ing her hard &s;ate, and de&s;pi&s;ing
that &s;uperfluity of wealth, in &s;pite of which &s;he
finds her&s;elf &s;o truly wretched.&endq;</P>
<P>The old gentleman &s;eemed to be &s;tartled at
this ob&s;ervation, which was reinforced by Renal|do's
&s;aying, that he would, moreover, enjoy the
unutterable plea&s;ure of giving happine&s;s to a wor|thy
man, who&s;e gratitude would co-operate with
his love, in approving him&s;elf a dutiful &s;on, as
well as an affectionate hu&s;band. He then repre|&s;ented
the family di&s;quiets, and di&s;mal tragedies,
produced from &s;uch mercenary and compul&s;ive
matches; and in conclu&s;ion related the &s;tory of don
Diego and his daughter, which when the merchant
heard, he &s;tarted up with marks of terror in his
countenance, and throwing up the c$&s;ement,
called upon Valentine with great vociferation;
this was the name of his daughter's admirer, who
no &s;ooner heard the &s;ummons, than he flew to
the &s;pot from whence it came, and the merchant,
without any further preamble, &s;eizing his hand,
joined it with that of Charlotte, &s;aying, with
great trepidation, &startq;Here take her, in the name
<PB N="286" REF="287">
of God, and thank this honourable company for
your good fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>The lovers were tran&s;ported with exqui&s;ite joy
at this &s;udden determination in their favour. Va|lentine
having ki&s;&s;ed the hand of his mi&s;tre&s;s, with
all the eagerne&s;s of rapture, and acknowledged
the merchant's genero&s;ity, paid his re&s;pects to the
ladies with a very polite addre&s;s, and with de|mon&s;trations
of uncommon gratitude and &s;en&s;ibi|lity,
thanked the gentlemen, and the count in
particular, for their good offices, to which he at|tributed
the happine&s;s he now enjoyed. While
Serafina and madame Clement care&s;&s;ed the amia|ble
Charlotte, the re&s;t of the company congratu|lated
her admirer upon his choice and &s;ucce&s;s;
though the clergyman could not help reprehend|ing
him for profaning the &s;acerdotal habit.</P>
<P>Valentine heartily a&s;ked pardon for having gi|ven
&s;uch cau&s;e of offence, and hoped he &s;hould
be forgiven, as it was a di&s;gui&s;e which he thought
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of a &s;cheme
upon which his happine&s;s altogether depended.
He then, at the reque&s;t of Renaldo, unfolded the
my&s;tery of the hear&s;e, by giving them to under|&s;tand,
that Charlotte's father having got inkling
of their mutual pa&s;&s;ion, had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his clerk,
and conveyed his daughter to a country hou&s;e in
the neighbourhood of London, in order to cut
off their corre&s;pondence: notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
precautions, they had found means to communi|cate
with each other by letters, which were ma|naged
by a third per&s;on, and his rival being very
importunate in his &s;ollicitations, they had con|certed
the expedient of the hear&s;e, which he pro|vided
and conducted through a road contiguous to
the end of the merchant's garden, where Char|lotte
<PB N="287" REF="288">
being apprized of the de&s;ign, waited for its
approach, and embarked in it without he&s;itation.
Valentine thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;creened
from di&s;covery by his di&s;gui&s;e, but he was unfor|tunately
met by a &s;ervant of the family, who re|collected
his features, and immediately gave the
alarm, upon which the father and his friends took
hor&s;e, and pur&s;ued them by two different roads,
until they were overtaken at this place.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce fini&s;hed this &s;hort relation, when
his rival bluntly entering the apartment, with an
handkerchief tied round his eye, committed Va|lentine
to the charge of a con&s;table, who attended
him, by a warrant from a ju&s;tice of the peace in
that neighbourhood; and threatened to pro&s;ecute
the merchant on an action of damages for the lo&s;s
of an eye, which he &s;aid he had &s;u&s;tained in his
&s;ervice. The company endeavoured to appea&s;e
this citizen, by repre&s;enting, that his misfortune
was no other than a common inflammation; nor
was it owing to malice aforethought, but entirely
to the precipitate pa&s;&s;ion of an incen&s;ed young
man, who, by the bye, acted in his own defence.
At the &s;ame time the merchant promi&s;ed to make
any rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction; upon which the other
demanded an obligation, importing, that he
would, in ten days from the date, be&s;tow upon
him his daughter in marriage, with a portion of
fifteen thou&s;and pounds, or, in ca&s;e of failure,
pay him double the &s;um.</P>
<P>The merchant, exa&s;perated at this extrava|gant
demand, told him flatly, he had already
di&s;po&s;ed of his daughter to Valentine, who he be|lieved
was a much more de&s;erving man; and
that he was ready to wait upon the magi&s;trate
who had granted the warrant, in order to give
<PB N="288" REF="289">
bail for his future &s;on-in-law. This was a mor|tifying
declaration to the plaintiff, though he con|doled
him&s;elf with the hope of being a gainer by
the lo&s;s of his eye; and now the pain was over,
would have been very &s;orry to find his &s;ight re|trieved.
The old gentleman, Jo&s;hua, and Re|naldo
accompanied the pri&s;oner to the hou&s;e of
the ju&s;tice, where he was immediately admitted
to bail: upon their return, Valentine &s;hifted his
dre&s;s, and they &s;upped together with great cor|diality
and mirth, maintained at the expence of
the di&s;carded lover.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, don Diego walked a minuet with
madame Clement, for whom, by this time, he had
contracted an extraordinary degree of affection.
Valentine had the honour to dance with the in|comparable
Serafina, who&s;e beauty and attractions
dazzled the eyes of the new comers, and &s;truck
her ba&s;hful partner with awe and confu&s;ion; and
Melvile pre&s;ented his hand to the agreeable Char|lotte,
who performed &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of
her father, that he could not help expre&s;&s;ing his
joy and pride: he prai&s;ed God for throwing him
in the way of our company, and engaged the
clergyman to unite the young couple; after hav|ing
appointed a day for the ceremony, and in|vited
all pre&s;ent to the wedding. The evening hav|ing
been in&s;en&s;ibly con&s;umed in the&s;e avocations,
and the night pretty far advanced, the ladies with|drew
without ceremony; and the retreat of Se|rafina
filled Renaldo's brea&s;t with tumult and
emotion: his blood began to flow in impetuous
tides, his heart to beat with redoubled vigour and
velocity, while his eye &s;eemed to fla&s;h with more
than human &s;plendor: now his imagination be|gan
to anticipate with the enthu&s;ia&s;tic rage of an
<PB N="289" REF="290">
in&s;pired Sybil; he was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly tran&s;port|ed
from the conver&s;ation, and every nerve was
braced to &s;uch a degree of impatience, that hu|man
nature could not long endure the ten|&s;ion.</P>
<P>He therefore, having with&s;tood the impul&s;e
about a quarter of an hour, at length gave way
to his impetuo&s;ity, and &s;pringing from his friends,
found him&s;elf in a dark pa&s;&s;age, at the farther end
of which, he perceived madame Clement coming
out of a chamber with a light, which at &s;ight of
him &s;he &s;et down, and vani&s;hed in a moment.
This was the &s;tar that pointed to his paradi&s;e:
he hailed the &s;ignal, entered the apartment, and
like a lion ru&s;hing on his prey, approached the
nuptial bed, where Serafina, &s;urrounded by all the
graces of beauty, &s;oftne&s;s, &s;entiment, and truth,
lay trembling as a victim at the altar, and &s;trove
to hide her blu&s;hes from his view; the door was
&s;hut, the light extingui&s;hed: he owned his lot
was more than mortal man could claim.</P>
<P>Here let me draw the decent veil, that ought
to &s;hade the &s;acred my&s;teries of Hymen: away
unhallowed &s;coffers, who profane with idle plea|&s;antry,
or immode&s;t hint, the&s;e holy rites; and
leave tho&s;e happy lovers to enjoy, in one another's
arms, unutterable bli&s;s, the well-earned palm of
virtue and of con&s;tancy, which had undergone
the mo&s;t &s;evere refinement: a more de&s;erving
pair night's curtain &s;hrouds not in its dark ex|tent.</P>
<P>The thoughts of Renaldo's felicity threw a
damp on the &s;pirits of Valentine, who &s;aw the
term of his probation protracted a few days long|er,
and could not help wi&s;hing in his heart, that
he had atchieved the adventure which would have
<PB N="290" REF="291">
abridged his expectation, though at the expence
of the old gentleman's di&s;plea&s;ure. He filled a
bumper to the health of the bride and bridegroom,
and throwing up his eyes, with marks of admira|tion,
exclaimed, &startq;How happy is the count! alas!
five days longer mu&s;t I rein my impatience!&endq;
&startq;It is but rea&s;onable, you rogue, that your bet|ters
&s;hould have the &s;tart of you,&endq; &s;aid the mer|chant,
who did him ju&s;tice in the gla&s;s, and coun|&s;elled
him to drown his impatience with good cla|ret.
The youth followed his advice, and it was
late before the company retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e citizens, however, re&s;olved to &s;eize an
opportunity of rallying the new married couple,
according to cu&s;tom, and with that view aro&s;e
early in the morning, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of find|ing
them &s;till a&s;leep; but they were not a little
&s;urprized, when they entered the breakfa&s;ting
room, to &s;ee Renaldo, and his amiable bedfellow,
already dre&s;&s;ed, and waiting to do the honours of
the hou&s;e. The old gentleman would fain have
cracked a joke upon their extraordinary di&s;patch,
but he was &s;o much over-awed by the dignity,
and tamed by the &s;weetne&s;s of Serafina's carriage,
that he dur&s;t not give utterance to his conception;
and Valentine &s;tood &s;ilent and aba&s;hed, as in the
pre&s;ence of a &s;uperior being. After breakfa&s;t,
the&s;e gentlemen and Charlotte again expre&s;&s;ed
their &s;en&s;e of the obligations they owed to this
happy family, repeated their invitation, and tak|ing
leave, returned to London in a coach that
was provided over night.</P>
<P>Our friends being thus left to them&s;elves, don
Diego turning towards Melvile, &startq;Now, &s;aid
he, that I have yielded to the impatience of your
love, as well as to the eagerne&s;s of my own de&s;ire
<PB N="291" REF="292">
to make you happy, I mu&s;t beg leave to interrupt,
for a little while, the &s;tream of your mutual plea|&s;ure,
and propo&s;e a melancholy excur&s;ion, which,
however, will not be wholly void of enjoyment.
I have too long delayed the performance of my
duty at Antonia's grave: let us &s;pend the fore|noon
in that pious pilgrimage: I will drop a few
tears to the memory of that excellent woman,
and never afterwards &s;hall my friends be troubled
with my grief.&endq;</P>
<P>The propo&s;al being univer&s;ally approved, they
&s;et out for the place, which had oft been vi&s;ited
by the gentle Serafina, who conducted her father
to a black marble &s;tone, which Renaldo had or|dered
to be laid over the grave, and as he kneeled
to ki&s;s the monument, he perceived this plain in|&s;cription
in the Spani&s;h Tongue: <HI>Antonia de Ze|los
primera en todo lo que es &s;er bueno, y &s;in &s;egundo
en todo lo que fu&eacute; &s;er de&s;dichado, quedad con Dios!</HI>
that is, <HI>Antonia de Zeios, unmatched in virtue, and
unequalled in misfortune, adieu!</HI> &startq;O faithful
record! (cried the Ca&s;tilian, &s;miting his brea&s;t,
while his tears di&s;tilled upon the marble) thy
goodne&s;s was the gift of heaven, but thy misfor|tunes
were derived from the guilt of don Diego;
yet his &s;orrow &s;hall expiate his offence, and his
penitence find favour in the &s;ight of heaven: re&s;t,
re&s;t, ill-fated virtue! eternal peace &s;hall guard
thy tomb, and angels mini&s;ter to thy un&s;potted
&s;hade; nor &s;hall thine a&s;hes lie in dark ob&s;curity:
here will I rai&s;e a monument, more &s;uited to thy
excellence and name.&endq; Serafina melted with filial
tenderne&s;s, nor were the re&s;t unmoved at this
affecting &s;cene, which don Diego did not quit
without reluctance.</P>

<P>THE nature of this vi&s;it had &s;oftened every
heart, and &s;addened every countenance;
and they walked in &s;olemn &s;ilence to the other
&s;ide of the church-yard, in order to regain their
carriages; when, at the turning of the &s;tile, they
&s;aw a young woman, in wretched attire, running
out of a poor habitation, wringing her hands in
all the agony of de&s;pair. Notwith&s;tanding the
di&s;traction in her countenance, and the meanne&s;s
of her apparel, &s;he di&s;covered a regularity of fea|tures,
and a delicacy of air, which did not at all
corre&s;pond with the mi&s;ery of her equipage. The&s;e
exhibitions of extreme di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon attracted the
notice and compa&s;&s;ion of our company, and Mel|vile's
beauteous help-mate, acco&s;ting this forlorn

cau&s;e of her di&s;order.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! dear lady, cried the other, with all
the empha&s;is of woe, an unhappy gentleman now
breathes his la&s;t, within this inho&s;pitable hovel,
amid&s;t &s;uch exce&s;s of mi&s;ery, as would melt the
mo&s;t flinty bo&s;om: what then mu&s;t I feel, who
am connected with him by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of
love and conjugal affection!&endq; &startq;Who is the
unfortunate object? &s;aid the phy&s;ician.&endq; &startq;He
was once well known in the gay world: (replied
the young woman) his name is Fathom.&endq; Every
individual of the company &s;tarted at mention of
that dete&s;ted name. Serafina began to tremble
with emotion; and Renaldo, after a &s;hort pau&s;e,
declared he would go in, not with a view to exult
<PB N="293" REF="294">
over his mi&s;ery, but in order to contemplate the
cata&s;trophe of &s;uch a wicked life, that the moral
might be the more deeply engraved on his re|membrance.
The young counte&s;s, who&s;e tender
heart could not bear the &s;hock of &s;uch a &s;pectacle,
retired to the coach with madame Clement and
the Jew, while Renaldo, accompanied by the re&s;t,
entered a di&s;mal apartment, altogether void of
furniture and convenience, where they beheld the
wretched hero of the&s;e memoirs, &s;tretched almo&s;t
naked upon &s;traw, in&s;en&s;ible, convul&s;ed, and &s;eem|ingly
in the gra&s;p of death. He was wore to the
bone either by famine or di&s;temper; his face was
over&s;hadowed with hair and filth; his eyes were
&s;unk, glazed and di&s;torted; his no&s;trils dilated;
his lips covered with a black &s;lough, and his com|plexion
faded into a pale clay-colour, tending to
a yellow hue: in a word, the extremity of indi|gence,
&s;qualor and di&s;tre&s;s, could not be more
feelingly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>While Melvile peru&s;ed this melancholy le&s;&s;on,
and groaning, cried, &startq;Behold the fate of man,&endq;
he perceived a letter in the right hand of the un|fortunate
Fathom, which lay fa&s;t clinched acro&s;s
his brea&s;t. Curious to know the contents of this
paper, which the young woman &s;aid he had kept
in that po&s;ition for &s;everal days, he drew nearer
the wretched couch, and was not a little &s;urprized
to &s;ee it addre&s;&s;ed to the right honourable Renaldo
count de Melvile, to the care of Mr. Jo&s;hua Ma|na&s;&s;eh,
merchant in London. When he attempted
to di&s;engage this billet from the author's hand,
the &s;orrowing female fell on her knees, entreating
him to de&s;i&s;t, and telling him, &s;he had promi&s;ed,
upon oath, to communicate the contents to no
per&s;on upon earth, but to carry the letter, upon
<PB N="294" REF="295">
her husband's decea&s;e, to the gentleman to who&s;e
care it was directed.</P>
<P>Renaldo a&s;&s;ured her upon his honour, that he
was the very Renaldo count de Melvile for
whom it was intended; and the young crea|ture
was &s;o much confounded at this informa|tion,
that before &s;he could recollect her&s;elf,
Melvile had opened the billet and read the&s;e
words. &startq;If this paper &s;hould fall into the hands
of the noble Renaldo, he will under&s;tand that
Fathom was the mo&s;t execrable traitor that ever
impo&s;ed upon un&s;u&s;pecting benevolence, or at|tempted
to betray a generous benefactor. His
whole life was a &s;eries of fraud, perfidy and
the mo&s;t abominable ingratitude: but of all the
crimes that lay heavy upon his &s;oul, his being
acce&s;&s;ory to the death of the incomparable Sera|fina,
who&s;e father he had al&s;o robbed, was that,
for which he de&s;paired of heaven's forgivene&s;s,
notwith&s;tanding the dreadful compunction and
remor&s;e which have long preyed upon his heart,
together with the incredible mi&s;ery and deplo|rable
death which by this time he hath under|gone.
Tho' the&s;e &s;ufferings and &s;orrows can|not
attone for his enormous guilt, perhaps they
will excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the humane count
de Melvile: at lea&s;t, this confe&s;&s;ion which my
con&s;cience dictates under all the terrors of death
and futurity, may be a warning for him to
avoid henceforth a &s;miling villain, like the ex|ecrable
Fathom, upon who&s;e mi&s;erable &s;oul
almighty God have mercy.&endq;</P>
<P>Renaldo was deeply affected with the contents
of this &s;croll, which denoted &s;uch horror and
de&s;pair. He &s;aw there could be no di&s;&s;imula|tion
or fini&s;ter de&s;ign in this profe&s;&s;ion of peni|tence:
<PB N="295" REF="296">
he beheld the condition of the writer,
which put all his humane pa&s;&s;ions in commo|tion;
&s;o that he remembered nothing of Fathom
but his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. He could &s;c$r$e con|tain
tho&s;e indications which might have been
ju&s;tly deemed the effect of weakne&s;s and in|firmity;
and having de&s;ired the phy&s;ician and
clergyman to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the
benefit of that wretch's &s;oul and body, he ran
to the coach, and communicated the letter to
the ladies; at the &s;ame time drawing a picture
of the object he had &s;een, which brought tears
into the eyes of the gentle Serafina, who ear|ne&s;tly
intreated her lord to u&s;e his endeavours
for the relief and recovery of the unhappy man;
that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, live to enjoy the
benefit of mature repentance, and not die in
that dreadful de&s;pair which he manife&s;ted in
the letter.</P>
<P>Renaldo returning to the hou&s;e, found the
pious clergyman reading prayers with great $er|vency;
while don Diego &s;tood with his right
hand upon his brea&s;t, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon
the agonizing Fathom, and the young woman
kneeled with her &s;treaming eyes lifted up to
heaven, in an exta&s;y of grief and devotion: the
phy&s;ician had run to an apothecary's &s;hop in
the neighbourhood, from whence he &s;oon return|ed
with an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who applied a large bli&s;ter
to the back of the mi&s;erable patient, while the
female, by the doctor's direction, moi&s;tened his
mouth with a cordial which he had pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The&s;e charitable &s;teps being taken, Count de
Melvile intreated the apothecary's &s;ervant to
procure a tent bed for the accommodation of
the &s;ick per&s;on, with all imaginable di&s;patch;
<PB N="296" REF="297">
and in le&s;s than an hour, one was actually pitch|ed,
and Fathom lifted into it, after he had
been &s;hifted and in &s;ome mea&s;ure purified from
the dregs of his indigence. During this tran&s;|action
the ladies were conducted to a tavern
not far off, where dinner was be&s;poke, that
they might be at hand to &s;ee the effect of their
charity; which was not confined to what we
have already de&s;cribed, but extended &s;o far,
that in a little time, the apartment was comfort|ably
$urni&s;hed, and the young creature provided
with change of apparel, and money to procure
the nece&s;&s;aries of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all their care, the wretched
Fathom &s;till remained in&s;en&s;ible, and the doctor
pronounced a very unfavourable progno&s;tic,
while he ordered a pair of additional ve&s;icatories
to be laid upon his arms, and other proper
medicines to be admini&s;tred. After dinner, the
ladies ventur'd to vi&s;it the place, and when Se|rafina
cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold, the weeping female
fell at her feet, and ki&s;&s;ing her robe, ex|claimed,
&startq;Sure you are an angel from heaven!&endq;</P>
<P>The alteration in her dre&s;s had made a very
agreeable change in her appearance, &s;o that the
counte&s;s could now look upon her, without
&s;huddering at her di&s;tre&s;s: and as Fathom was
not in a condition to be di&s;turbed, &s;he took
this opportunity of inquiring by what &s;teps that
unfortunate wretch was conveyed from the
pri&s;on, in which &s;he knew he had been confined,
to the place where he now lay in &s;uch extre|mity;
and by what occurrence he had found a
wi$e in &s;uch an aby&s;s of misfortune. Here the
other's tears began to flow afre&s;h. &startq;I am a|&s;hamed
(&s;aid &s;he) to reveal my own folly;
<PB N="297" REF="298">
yet I dare not refu&s;e a &s;atisfaction of this kind,
to a per&s;on who has laid me under &s;uch &s;ignal
obligations.&endq;</P>
<P>She then proceeded to relate her &s;tory, by
which it appeared, &s;he was no other than the
fair and unhappy Elinor, whom the artful
Fathom had debauched upon his fir&s;t arrival in
town, in the manner already de&s;cribed in the&s;e
memoirs. &startq;Heaven, continued &s;he, was plea&s;ed
to re&s;tore the u&s;e of my rea&s;on which I had lo&s;t,
when I found my&s;elf abandoned by the count;
but, all my connexion with my own family be|ing
entirely cut off, and every door &s;hut again&s;t
a poor creature who could procure no recom|mendation,
except the certificate &s;igned by the
phy&s;ician of bedlam, which in&s;tead of introduc|ing
me to &s;ervice, was an un&s;urmountable ob|jection
to my character; I found my&s;elf de&s;titute
of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, unle&s;s I would con|de&s;cend
to live the infamous and wretched life of
a courtezan, an expedient rendered palatable
by the terrors of want cooperating with the
reflection of the irretrievable lo&s;s I had already
&s;u&s;tained. I a&s;k pardon for offending your cha&s;te
ears with this impure confe&s;&s;ion of my guilt,
which heaven knows, I then did, and now do
look upon with abhorrence and dete&s;tation. I
had already forfeited my innocence, and wanted
re&s;olution to encounter mi&s;ery and death. Ne|verthele&s;s,
before I could determine to embrace
the condition of a pro&s;titute, I was one day
acco&s;ted in the park by an elderly gentleman
who &s;at down by me upon a bench, and taking
notice of the de&s;pondence which was evident in
my countenance, pre&s;&s;ed me to make him ac|quainted
with the nature of my misfortune. So
<PB N="298" REF="299">
much &s;ympathy and good &s;en&s;e appeared in his
deportment and conver&s;ation, that I gratified his
reque&s;t, and he, in return for my confidence,
&s;aved me from the mo&s;t horrible part of my
pro&s;pect, by taking me into his protection, and
re&s;erving me for his own appetite. In this &s;itu|ation
I lived a whole year, until I was deprived
of my keeper by an apoplectic fit, and turned
out of doors by his relations, who did not, how|ever,
&s;trip me of the cloaths and moveables,
which I owed to his bounty. Far from being
as yet reconciled to a vitious life, I re&s;olved to
renounce the paths of &s;hame, and converting my
effects into ready money, hired a &s;mall &s;hop,
and furni&s;hed it with haberda&s;hery ware, in|tending
to earn an hone&s;t livelihood by the &s;ale
of the&s;e commodities, together with the plain|work
in which I hoped to be employed, &s;o &s;oon
as my talents &s;hould be known. But this &s;cheme
did not an&s;wer my expectation. The goods
&s;poiled upon my hands, and as I was a &s;tranger
in the neighbourhood, no body would intru&s;t
me with any other bu&s;ine&s;s: &s;o that notwith|&s;tanding
the mo&s;t par&s;imonious oeconomy, I ran
in debt to my landlord, who &s;eized my effects;
and an ho&s;ier from whom I had received &s;ome
parcels upon credit, took out a writ again&s;t me,
by virtue of which, I was arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned
in the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, where I found my fir&s;t &s;edu|cer.
Good heaven! what did I feel at this un|expected
meeting, overwhelmed as I was before,
with my own di&s;tre&s;s! I with a loud &s;cream
fainted away, and when I recovered, found my|&s;elf
in the arms of Mr. Fathom, who wept over
me with great affliction. All his pro&s;pects of
<PB N="299" REF="300">
gaiety had now vani&s;hed, and his heart was
&s;oftened by his own misfortunes, to a feeling of
another's woe, as well as to a due &s;en&s;e of his
own guilt. He expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;orrow
for having been the occa&s;ion of my ruin, en|deavour'd
to comfort me with promi&s;e of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
and indeed, by practi&s;ing medicine a|mong
the pri&s;oners, made &s;hift to keep us both
from &s;tarving. But &s;urely, no &s;inner under|went
&s;uch &s;evere remor&s;e as that which he &s;uf|fered
during his impri&s;oment. From the day of
our meeting. I never once &s;aw him &s;mile; a
melancholy cloud continually overhung his coun|tenance.
He numbered the minutes by h$s groans,
he u&s;ed to &s;tart with horrour from his &s;leep, and
&s;triking his brea&s;t, would exclaim, &startq;O Elinor!
I am the wor&s;t of villains!&endq; Sometimes he &s;eemed
di&s;ordered in his brain, and raved about Renaldo
and Monimia: in a word, his mind was in a
dreadful &s;ituation, and all his agonies were com|municated
to me, whom by this time he had
married, in order to make &s;ome attonement for
my wrongs. Wretched as he then was, I re|membered
the accompli&s;hed youth who had cap|tivated
my virgin heart, the old impre&s;&s;ions &s;till
remained, I &s;aw his penitence, pitied his mis|fortune;
and his wife being dead, con&s;ented to
join his fate, the ceremony having been per|formed
by a fellow pri&s;oner, who was in or|ders.
Though his hard-hearted creditor had no
other chance of being payed, than that of &s;et|ting
him at liberty, he lent a deaf ear to all our
&s;upplications; and this cruelty con&s;piring with the
angui&s;h of my hu&s;band's own reflection, affected
his health and &s;pirits to &s;uch a degree, that he
<PB N="300" REF="301">
could no longer earn the mi&s;erable pittance
which had hitherto &s;upported our lives. Then
our calamities began to multiply. Indigence and
famine &s;tared us in the face; and it was with the
utmo&s;t difficulty that we re&s;i&s;ted their attacks,
by &s;elling or pledging our wearing apparel, un|til
we were left almo&s;t quite naked, when we
found our&s;elves di&s;charged by an act pa&s;&s;ed for
the relief of in&s;olvent debtors. This charitable
law, which was intended for a con&s;olation to the
wretched, proved to us the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;|a&s;ter:
for, we were turned out into the &s;treets,
utterly de&s;titute of food, raiment and lodging;
at a time when Mr. Fathom was &s;o weakened
by his di&s;temper, that he could not &s;tand alone.
I &s;upported him from door to door, imploring
the compa&s;&s;ion of charitable chri&s;tians, and was
at length permitted to &s;helter him in this mi&s;e|rable
place, where his di&s;ea&s;e gaining ground,
he lay three days in that deplorable condition,
from which he hath now been re&s;cued (tho' I
fear too late) by your humanity and benevo|lence.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;hed a flood of tears at the conclu&s;ion of
this mournful tale which did not fail to affect the
whole audience, e&s;pecially Serafina, who a&s;&s;ured
her, that whatever &s;hould happen to her hus|band,
&s;he might depend upon finding favour and
protection, provided her conduct &s;hould cor|re&s;pond
with her profe&s;&s;ions. While this grate|ful
creature ki&s;&s;ed the hand of her kind be|ne&s;actre&s;s,
Fathom uttered a groan, began
to &s;tir in the bed, and with a languid voice
called upon Elinor, who in&s;tantly withdrawing
the curtain, pre&s;ented the whole company to
<PB N="301" REF="302">
his view. He had now retrieved the u&s;e of his
perception, by the operation of the bli&s;ters which
began to torture him &s;everely; he looked around
him with amazement and affright, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
the three per&s;ons again&s;t whom the
chief arrows of his &s;raud and treachery had been
levelled, he concluded that he was now arrived
at the land of departed &s;ouls, and that the &s;hades
of tho&s;e whom he had &s;o grievou&s;ly injured,
were come to &s;ee him tormented according to
his demerits.</P>
<P>Fraught with this notion, which was con|firmed
by the bodily pain which he felt, and
the appearance of the clergyman and Jo&s;hua
whom he mi&s;took for the mini&s;ters of vengeance,
he cried in a tone replete with horrour, &startq;Is
there no mercy then for penitence! is there no
pity due to the mi&s;eries I &s;uffered upon earth!
&s;ave me, O bountiful heaven! from the terrors of
everla&s;ting woe; hide me from the&s;e dreadful
executioners, who&s;e looks are torture: forgive
me, generous Ca&s;tilian. O Renaldo! thou had&s;t
once a tender heart. I dare not lift my eyes
to Serafina! that pattern of human excellence
who fell a victim to my atrocious guilt; yet,
her a&s;pect is all mildne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. Ha!
are not the&s;e the drops of pity? yes, they are
tears of mercy: they fall like refre&s;hing &s;howers
upon my drooping &s;oul! ah murthered inno|cence!
wilt thou not intercede for thy betrayer
at the throne of grace!&endq;</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by Melvile, who with
a grave and &s;olemn air, pronounced, &startq;Great
hath been thy guilt, unhappy Ferdinand, and
great have been thy &s;ufferings. Yet, we come
<PB N="302" REF="303">
not to in&s;ult, but to alleviate thy di&s;tre&s;s. Pro|vidence
hath kindly defeated thy dire intentions,
which we therefore now forgive and tran&s;mit to
oblivion&punc; whether it be thy lot to yield up thy
&s;pirit immediately, or to &s;urvive the dangerous
malady with which thou art at pre&s;ent over|whelmed.
Suffer not thy&s;elf to de&s;pair; for,
the mercy of heaven is infinite; and &s;ubmit to
the directions of this worthy gentleman who will
employ his &s;kill for thy recovery, while we &s;hall
take care to furni&s;h thee with nece&s;&s;ary at|tendance:
as too much &s;peaking may be pre|judicial
to thy health, I di&s;pen&s;e with a reply,
and exhort thee to compo&s;e thy &s;elf to re&s;t.&endq;
So &s;aying, he drew the curtain, and the com|pany
retired, leaving Fathom intranced with
wonder.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep which Renaldo took for the
benefit of this wretched penitent, was to &s;end
for the apothecary with whom he left a &s;um
of money to be expended for the convenience
of Fathom and his wife; then he laid injunc|tions
upon the phy&s;ician to repeat his vi&s;its;
and that gentleman, together with the clergyman
and Jo&s;hua, taking leave of the others till next
day, the count &s;et out with the ladies and his
father in law, to the hou&s;e where they had lodg|ed
the preceding night.</P>
<P>The reader may well imagine the conver&s;a|tion
of the evening turned wholly upon the
&s;trange occurrence of the day, which &s;eemed
to have been concerted by &s;upernatural pre|&s;cience,
in order to &s;atisfy the vengeance, and
afford matter of triumph to the genero&s;ity of
tho&s;e who had been &s;o grievou&s;ly injured by the
<PB N="303" REF="304">
guilty Fathom. Tho' not one of them would
&s;ay that &s;uch a mi&s;creant ought to live; yet all
concurred in approving the offices of humanity
which had been performed, and even endea|voured
to find &s;pecious pretexts for vindicating
their compa&s;&s;ion. Don Diego &s;aid it would ill
become a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or like him, to with-hold his
forgivene&s;s from a &s;inner who had wrong'd
him: Madame Clement appealed to the appro|bation
of heaven, which had undoubtedly directed
them that way, for the purpo&s;e they had ful|filled:
Sera&s;ina ob&s;erved that the crimes of the
delinquent were obliterated by his &s;orrow, mi|&s;ery
and repentance: Renaldo hone&s;tly owned
that, exclu&s;ive of other rea&s;ons, he could not
deny him&s;elf the luxurious enjoyment of com|municating
happine&s;s to his fellow creatures in
di&s;tre&s;s; and each fervently prayed that their
charity might not be di&s;appointed by the death
of the object.</P>
<P>While they amu&s;ed them&s;elves in the&s;e di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions,
Fathom, after having lain &s;ome hours
&s;ilent, in con&s;equence of Renaldo's advice, could
no longer &s;uppre&s;s the a&s;toni&s;hment of his mind,
but, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his wife, &startq;O Elinor!
(&s;aid he) my delirium is now pa&s;t: tho' I &s;till
remember the phanta&s;ies of my di&s;temper'd brain:
among other reveries, my imagination was re|galed
with a vi&s;ion &s;o perfect and di&s;tinct, as
to emulate truth and reality. Methought count
de Melvile, don Diego de Zelos, and the di|vine
Serafina, the very per&s;ons who are now
crying before the throne of heaven for venge|ance
again&s;t the guilty Fathom, &s;tood by my
bed&s;ide, with looks of pity and forgivene&s;s; and
<PB N="304" REF="305">
that Renaldo &s;poke peace to my de&s;pairing &s;oul.
I heard the words di&s;tinctly: I retain them in
my memory. I &s;aw the tears trickle from Se|rafina's
eyes: I heard her father utter a com|pa&s;&s;ionate
&s;igh; and &s;hould actually believe that
they were per&s;onally pre&s;ent, had not I long
ago &s;een with my own eyes, the funeral pro|ce&s;&s;ion
of that young lady who&s;e wrongs God
pardon; and were I not convinced that &s;uch a
meeting could not be effected without the im|mediate
and miraculous interpo&s;ition of heaven.
Yet every thing I now &s;ee, corre&s;ponds with the
words of Renaldo, which &s;till &s;ound in my ears.
When my perception for&s;ook me, I lay in the
mo&s;t abject mi&s;ery, among &s;traw; and thou,
poor injured innocence, wa&s;t naked and forlorn.
Now, I find my&s;elf repo&s;ed in a warm ea&s;y
comfortable bed: I &s;ee around me the marks
of human charity and care, and the favourable
change in thy appearance, glads my poor de|jected
heart. Say, whence this happy altera|tion?
Do I really wake from that dream of
mi&s;ery in which we have continued &s;o long?
or do I &s;till utter the extravagant ravings of a
di&s;temper'd brain?&endq;</P>
<P>Elinor was afraid of imparting at once all
the particulars of the happy change he had un|dergone,
le&s;t they might leave a dangerous im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon his fancy, which was not yet duly
compo&s;ed: &s;he contented her&s;elf, therefore, with
telling him that he had been obliged to the hu|manity
of a gentleman and lady, who chanced
to pa&s;s that way by accident, and who under|&s;tanding
his deplorable ca&s;e, had furni&s;hed him
with the conveniencies which he now enjoyed:
<PB N="305" REF="306">
&s;he then pre&s;ented to him, what the doctor had
directed her to admini&s;ter, and admoni&s;hing him
to commit his head to the pillow, he was fa|voured
with a breathing &s;weat, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep,
and in a few hours waked again altogether cool
and undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>It was upon this occa&s;ion that his wife ex|plained
the circum&s;tances of that vi&s;it which had
redeemed him from extremity of wretchedne&s;s
and the jaws of death; upon which, he &s;tarted
up and throwing him&s;elf upon his knees, ex|claimed,
&startq;All gracious power! this was the
work of thy own bounteous hand; the voice of
my &s;orrow and repentance hath been heard. Thou
ha&s;t in&s;pired my benefactors with more than mor|tal
goodne&s;s, in my behalf; how &s;hall I prai&s;e
thy name! how &s;hall I requite their genero&s;ity!
O I am bankrupt to both! yet, let me not peri&s;h
until I &s;hall have convinced them of my refor|mation,
and &s;een them enjoying that felicity
which ought to be re&s;erved for &s;uch con&s;ummate
virtue.&endq;</P>
<P>Next day in the forenoon, he was vi&s;ited by
the phy&s;ician, whom he now recollected to have
&s;een at the hou&s;e of madame Clement; and
after having thanked that gentleman for his hu|manity
and care, he earne&s;tly begged to know
by what means Serafina had been pre&s;erved.
When he was &s;atisfied in this particular, and
given to under&s;tand that &s;he was now happy
in the arms of Renaldo, &startq;Ble&s;&s;ed be God! (he
cried) for having defeated the villany of him who
&s;ought to part &s;uch lovers. Dear &s;ir, will you
add one circum&s;tance to your charity, and bear
to that happy couple and the noble don Diego,
the re&s;pects and the remor&s;e of a &s;incere penitent,
<PB N="306" REF="307">
whom their compa&s;&s;ion hath rai&s;ed to life. I
have been &s;uch a traitor to them, that my
words de&s;erve no regard. I will not therefore
u&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. I dare not hope to be admit|ted
into their pre&s;ence. I am indeed, a&s;hamed
to &s;ee the light of the &s;un: how then could I
bear the looks of that injured family! ah, no!
let me hide my&s;elf in &s;ome ob&s;cure retreat, where
I may work out my &s;alvation with fear and trem|bling,
and pray ince&s;&s;antly to heaven for their
pro&s;perity.&endq;</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician promi&s;ed to repre&s;ent his con|trition
to the count and his lady, and accord|ingly
proceeded to their habitation, where he
repeated the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, and pronounced his
patient out of danger: &s;o that their thoughts
were now employed in concerting a &s;cheme for
his future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, that he might not be ex|po&s;ed
by indigence to a relap&s;e in point of mo|rals.
Renaldo being &s;till aver&s;e to any per&s;onal
intercour&s;e with &s;uch a wretch, until he &s;hould
give &s;ome undoubted proofs of amendment, and
as yet afraid of intru&s;ting him with any office
that required integrity, re&s;olved, with the appro|bation
of all pre&s;ent, to &s;ettle him in a cheap
country in the north of England, where he and
his wife could live comfortably on an annuity of
&s;ixty pounds, until his behaviour &s;hould intitle
him to a better provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution was ju&s;t taken, when Jo&s;hua
arrived with a gentleman whom he introduced to
don Diego as the &s;ecretary of the Spani&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador.
After the fir&s;t compliments, this &s;tran|ger
told the Ca&s;tilian, that he waited upon him
at the de&s;ire of his excellency, who would have
<PB N="307" REF="308">
come in per&s;on, had he not been confined by
the gout; then he put into his hand, a letter
from the court of Madrid, written by a noble|man
of Diego's acquaintance, who informed him
that don Manuel de Mendoza having made away
with him&s;elf by poi&s;on, in order to avoid the
di&s;grace of a legal conviction, his catholic ma|je&s;ty
was now convinced of don Diego's inno|cence,
and granted him leave to return and
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his honours and e&s;tate. This
information was confirmed by the &s;ecretary, who
a&s;&s;ured him that the amba&s;&s;ador had orders to
make him acquainted with this favourable de|ci&s;ion
of the king. The Ca&s;tilian having fir&s;t
acquitted him&s;elf in the mo&s;t polite terms to the
&s;ecretary and the Jew who, he &s;aid, had always
been a me&s;&s;enger of glad tidings, communi|cated
his happine&s;s to the company; and this
evening concluded the third day of their re|joicing.</P>
<P>Next morning, don Diego went to vi&s;it the
amba&s;&s;ador, accompanied by Jo&s;hua and the
&s;ecretary; while the phy&s;ician repairing to the
habitation of Fathom, &s;ignified, by Renaldo's
direction, the re&s;olution which had been taken
in his behalf; and the patient no &s;ooner heard
his doom, than lifting up his hands, he cried,
&startq;I am unworthy of &s;uch tenderne&s;s and bene|volence:&endq;
while Elinor &s;hed a flood of tears in
&s;ilence, unable to give utterance to her grateful
thought: Melvile's bounty having &s;o far tran|&s;cended
her mo&s;t &s;anguine hope.</P>
<P>The Spaniard having paid his devoirs to his
excellency, returned before dinner; and, in the
afternoon, de&s;iring a private conference with Se|rafina,
<PB N="308" REF="309">
they retired into another apartment, and
he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this effect. &startq;You have
contracted, my dear child, an habit of calling
madame Clement your mother, and doubtle&s;s,
by her maternal tenderne&s;s and regard, &s;he hath
acquired a ju&s;t title to the appellation: yet, I
own, I would fain &s;trengthen it by a legal claim.
I no &s;ooner retrieved my daughter, than I gave
her away to the mo&s;t de&s;erving youth that ever
&s;ighed with love. I rejoice in the gift which &s;e|cured
your happine&s;s: but I left my&s;elf in a &s;oli|tary
&s;ituation which even the return of my good
fortune cannot render ea&s;y and &s;upportable. When
I revi&s;it the ca&s;tle of Zelos, every well known
object will recal the memory of my Antonia, and I
&s;hall want a companion to fill her place, and to
&s;ympathize with me in that &s;orrow which will be
derived from my remembrance. Who is there
&s;o worthy to &s;ucceed your mother in the affec|tion
of Don Diego, as &s;he who intere&s;ts her love
for Serafina, and re&s;embles her &s;o &s;trongly in every
virtue of the &s;ex? &s;imilar attractions will produce
&s;imilar effects. My heart is already attached to
that good lady; and, provided Serafina &s;hall ap|prove
of my choice, I will lay my&s;elf and for|tune
at her feet.&endq;</P>
<P>The fair counte&s;s replied with an enchanting
&s;mile, that, before this declaration, &s;he had with
plea&s;ure perceived the progre&s;s which madame
Clement had made in his heart; and that &s;he did
not believe there was a per&s;on upon earth better
qualified to repair the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained; tho'
&s;he fore&s;aw one ob&s;tacle to his happine&s;s, which
&s;he was afraid would not be ea&s;ily &s;urmounted.
&startq;You mean,&endq; an&s;wered the Ca&s;tilian, &startq;the
<PB N="309" REF="310">
difference of religion, which I am re&s;olved to re|move
by adopting the prote&s;tant faith; though I
am fully &s;atisfied that real goodne&s;s is of no par|ticular
per&s;ua&s;ion, and that &s;alvation cannot de|pend
upon belief, over which the will has no in|fluence.
I inve&s;t you therefore with the charge
of declaring my pa&s;&s;ion and propo&s;al, and im|power
you to &s;atisfy her &s;cruples with regard to
the religion which I now profe&s;s; and which I
&s;hall not openly relinqui&s;h, until I &s;hall have &s;e|cured
in this country, effects &s;ufficient to &s;creen
me from the ill con&s;equences of my king's di&s;|plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>Serafina undertook this office with plea&s;ure,
becau&s;e &s;he had rea&s;on to think his addre&s;&s;es
would not be di&s;agreeable to madame Clement;
and that &s;ame night made the count acquainted
with the nature of her commi&s;&s;ion. Nor was her
expectation di&s;appointed: the French lady, with
that frankne&s;s which is peculiar to virtue and
good breeding, confe&s;&s;ed that don Diego was not
indifferent to her choice, and did not he&s;itate in
receiving him upon the footing of a lover. As
we have already dwelt circum&s;tantially on the
pa&s;&s;ion of love, &s;o as perhaps even to have tired
our readers, we &s;hall not repeat the dialogue that
pa&s;&s;ed, when the Spaniard was indulged with an
opportunity to explain his &s;entiments. Suffice it
to ob&s;erve, that the lady's days of coquetry were
now over, and that &s;he was too wi&s;e to trifle with
the time which every moment became more and
more precious. It was agreed then, that don
Diego &s;hould &s;ettle his affairs in Spain, and return
to England, in order to e&s;pou&s;e madame Cle|ment,
with a view to fix his re&s;idence in this
<PB N="310" REF="311">
i&s;land, where Renaldo likewi&s;e propo&s;ed to enjoy
the &s;weets of his fortune, provided he could draw
hither his intere&s;ts and connexions.</P>
<P>Mean while, having for &s;ome days enjoyed his
bli&s;s with all the fulne&s;s of rapture, amid&s;t this
&s;mall but agreeable &s;ociety, he &s;hifted the &s;cene,
and conducted his dear partner to a ready furni&s;h|ed
hou&s;e in town, which, together with an occa|&s;ional
equipage, his friend Jo&s;hua had hired for
the accommodation of him and his father-in-law,
who during his &s;tay in England, failed not
to cultivate the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart, with the
mo&s;t punctual a&s;&s;iduity. Hitherto Serafina had
been as a precious jewel locked up in a ca&s;ket,
which the owner alone has an opportunity to
contemplate: but now the count, who was proud
of &s;uch a prize, re&s;olved to let her &s;hine forth to
the admiration of the whole world. With this
view, he be&s;poke &s;uch ornaments as befitted her
quality, and while the mantua-makers were em|ployed
in her &s;ervice, made a tour among his
former acquaintance, and di&s;charged the obliga|tions
under which he lay to &s;ome who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him in his di&s;tre&s;s. He did not, however, introduce
them to his charming Serafina; becau&s;e not one
of them had formerly treated her with that deli|cacy
of regard which he thought her due; and
&s;ome of them were much mortified at their neg|lect,
when they &s;aw what a dazzling figure &s;he
made in the beau monde.</P>
<P>She was vi&s;ited by the Spani&s;h and Imperial
amba&s;&s;adors, and divers other foreigners of di&s;|tinction,
to whom Melvile had letters of recom|mendation:
but her fir&s;t public appearance was
in a box at the opera, accompanied by madame
<PB N="311" REF="312">
Clement, the count and don Diego: the enter|tainment
was already begun, &s;o that her entrance
had the greater effect upon the audience, who&s;e
attention was &s;oon detached from the perform|ance,
and rivetted upon this amiable apparition,
which &s;eemed to be &s;ome bright being of another
world dropt from the clouds among them. Then
did the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity play its part: a thou&s;and
whi&s;pers circulated; as many gla&s;&s;es were exalt|ed
to reconnoitre this box of foreigners; for &s;uch
they concluded them to be from their appearance.
Every male &s;pectator acknowledged Serafina to be
the paragon of beauty; and every female confe&s;|&s;ed,
that Melvile was the model of a fine gentle|man.
The charms of the young counte&s;s did
not e&s;cape the eye and approbation of royalty it|&s;elf;
and when her rank was known, from the
information of the amba&s;&s;adors and other people of
condition who were &s;een &s;aluting her at a di&s;tance,
that &s;ame evening a thou&s;and bumpers were
&s;wallowed in honour of the counte&s;s de Melvile.
The fame of her beauty was immediately extend|ed
over this immen&s;e metropolis, and different
&s;chemes were concerted for bringing her into
life. The&s;e, however, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted with un|wearied
ob&s;tinacy. Her happine&s;s centered in
Renaldo, and the cultivation of a few friends with|in
the &s;hade of dome&s;tic quiet: &s;he did not even
forget the concerns of the wretched Fathom and
his faithful Elinor, who daily enjoyed fre&s;h in|&s;tances
of her humanity and care: when his fever
for&s;ook him, he was &s;upplied with nouri&s;hing
food for the recovery of his health; and &s;oon as
he found him&s;elf in a condition to travel, he gave
notice to his benefactor, who de&s;ired Jo&s;hua to
<PB N="312" REF="313">
&s;ettle with him the manner in which he was to
receive his allowance, and to pay the fir&s;t half
year's &s;alary per advance.</P>
<P>This affair being adju&s;ted, and the place of his
retreat &s;ignified, the Jew told Elinor, that &s;he
might wait upon the counte&s;s before their depar|ture;
and &s;he did not fail to make u&s;e of this per|mi&s;&s;ion.
After they had made the nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations
for their journey, and taken places in the
York &s;tage-coach, Mrs. Fathom, cloathing her|&s;elf
in decent apparel, went to the hou&s;e of count
Melvile, and was immediately admitted to the
pre&s;ence of Serafina, who received her with her
u&s;ual complacency, enriched her with &s;alutary ad|vice,
comforted her with hope of better things, pro|vided
her conduct and that of her hu&s;band &s;hould
henceforth be found irreproachable; and wi&s;hing
her peace and happine&s;s, pre&s;ented her with a
box of linen, and twenty guineas in a pur&s;e.
Such exce&s;&s;ive goodne&s;s overpowered this &s;en&s;ible
young woman to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he &s;tood
before her in &s;peechle&s;s awe and veneration; and
the counte&s;s, in order to relieve her from the con|fu&s;ion
under which &s;he &s;uffered, quitted the room,
leaving her to the care of her woman. It was
not long, however, before her gratitude broke
out in loud exclamations and a violent pa&s;&s;ion
of tears, which all her efforts could not, for a
good while, overcome. By this time the coach
was brought up to the gate, for the reception of
Serafina, who took an airing every day at the
&s;ame hour; when Renaldo, leading her to the
vehicle, beheld a man plainly dre&s;&s;ed &s;tanding
within the court, with his head and body bent
<PB N="313" REF="314">
towards the earth, &s;o that his countenance could
not be perceived.</P>
<P>Melvile, who &s;uppo&s;ed him to be &s;ome unfor|tunate
man come to implore his charity, turned
towards him, and a&s;ked, with a humane accent, if
he wanted to &s;peak with any per&s;on in the hou&s;e?
To this interrogation the &s;tranger replied, without
lifting up his head, &startq;Overwhelmed as I am with
count Melvile's genero&s;ity, together with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of my own unworthine&s;s, it ill becomes
a wretch like me to importune him for further
favour; yet I could not bear the thought of with|drawing
(perhaps for ever) from the pre&s;ence of
my benefactor, without &s;olliciting his permi&s;&s;ion
to &s;ee his face in mercy, to acknowledge my at|trocious
crimes, to hear my pardon confirmed by
his voice, and that of his accompli&s;hed counte&s;s,
whom I dare not even at a di&s;tance behold;
and to expre&s;s my fervent wi&s;h for their pro&s;pe|rity.&endq;</P>
<P>Melvile, who&s;e heart was but too tender,
could not hear this addre&s;s without emotion:
he recognized the companion of his infancy and
youth; he remembred the happy &s;cenes he had
enjoyed with Fathom, who&s;e voice had always &s;uch
an effect upon his ear, as to excite the ideas of
friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; and he was di&s;turbed by
this unexpected meeting, which al&s;o di&s;compo&s;ed
the beauteous Serafina. Renaldo having pau&s;ed a
little, &startq;It is with pain,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I recollect
any thing to the prejudice of Fathom, who&s;e fu|ture
behaviour will, I hope, eraze the memory
of his offences, and ju&s;tify what other &s;teps I may
take in his favour. Mean while I heartily for|give
what is pa&s;t; and, in token of my &s;inceri|ty,
<PB N="314" REF="315">
pre&s;ent my hand;&endq; which our adventurer
bathed with his tears. The counte&s;s, who&s;e
mind was uni&s;on with her hu&s;band, repeated her
a&s;&s;urances of pardon and protection; at which
the penitent rejoiced in &s;ilence, while he rai&s;ed
his head and took a parting view of tho&s;e charms
which had formerly en&s;laved his heart.</P>
<P>Having thus obeyed the dictates of his duty and
inclination, he next morning embarked in the
&s;tage-coach, with his faithful Elinor, and in &s;ix
days arrived at the place of his retreat, which he
found extremely well adapted to the circum&s;tances
of his mind and fortune: for all his vice and am|bition
was now quite mortified within him, and
his whole attention engro&s;&s;ed in atoning for his
former crimes, by a &s;ober and penitent life, by
which alone he could de&s;erve the uncommon ge|nero&s;ity
of his patrons.</P>
<P>While he thus accommodated him&s;elf to his
new &s;y&s;tem, Renaldo received letters of congra|tulation
from his &s;i&s;ter, who with the major had
come to Bru&s;&s;els, in order to meet her brother
and Serafina, according to his propo&s;al. This
intimation being communicated to don Diego,
he re&s;olved to accompany them to Flanders, in his
way to Spain. Preparations were made for their
departure; the clergyman and phy&s;ician were
honoured with valuable marks of friend&s;hip and
e&s;teem from the counte&s;s, Renaldo, and the Ca&s;|tilian,
who were convoyed to Deal by madame
Clement, to whom, at parting, don Diego pre|&s;ented
a diamond ring, as a pledge of his inviolable
love.</P>
<P>Here the travellers hired a ve&s;&s;el for O&s;tend,
which they reached in a few hours; in two days
<PB N="315" REF="316">
more they arrived at Bru&s;&s;els, where mrs. Farrel
and her hu&s;band were &s;truck with admiration at
the &s;urprizing beauty and accompli&s;hment of their
&s;i&s;ter-in-law, whom they care&s;&s;ed with equal ten|derne&s;s
and joy.&mdash;In a word, all parties were as
happy as good fortune could make them; and
don Diego &s;et out for Spain, after they had
agreed to re&s;ide in the Low Countries 'till his
return.</P>
