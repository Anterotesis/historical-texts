<P>_AT length comes into the world, <HI>The fir&s;t Volume of the Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion, and Civil Wars in England, begun in the Year 1641, with the precedent Pa&s;|&s;ages and Actions, that contri|buted thereunto, and the Hap|py End and Conclu&s;ion thereof, by the King's ble&s;&s;ed Re&s;tora|tion, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and Return, upon the 29^th of May in the Year 1660;</HI> Written by <HI>Edward Earl of Clarendon,</HI> once Lord High Chan|cellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Chancellor of the Famous Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e great Dignities King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd had conferr'd on him, whil&s;t he was yet in Bani&s;hment with him; which he held, after the Re&s;toration, above &s;even Years, with the Univer&s;al Approbation of the whole Kingdom, and the General Applau&s;e of all good Men, for his Ju&s;tice, Integrity, &s;ound Judgement, and Eminent Sufficiency in the di&s;charge of that Office; a Prai&s;e, which none of his Enemies ever denied him, in any Time:
<PB N="II" REF="70">
The other he received from the Choice of the Univer&s;ity; who, upon the Vacancy of that Place, by the death of the Marquis of <HI>Hert|ford,</HI> then Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> judged they could not better mani|fe&s;t their &s;teddine&s;s in the Cau&s;e, for which they had &s;uffer'd, and their Re&s;olutions of adhering to their old Principles, in &s;upport of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Ancient Monarchical Govern|ment of this Kingdom, than in choo&s;ing to place the Protection of their Intere&s;t in both, under the $are of one, who had &s;o early di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, even from the fir&s;t Approaches of the Civil War, in a&s;&s;erting and maintaining the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Rights of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Church and Crown.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory was fir&s;t begun by the expre&s;s Command of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t; who, having a de&s;ire, that an account of the Calamities, God was plea&s;ed to inflict on the Unhappy part of his Reign, &s;hould be reported to Po&s;terity by &s;ome worthy, hone&s;t, and knowing Man, thought he could not appoint any one, more adorn'd with &s;uch Qualifications, than this Author.</P>
<P>It is a difficult Province to write the Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars of a great and powerful Nation, where the King was engaged with one Part of his Subjects again&s;t the other, and both &s;ides were <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;ufficiently inflamed: And the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peaking the Truth of &s;everal Great Men, that were engaged in the Quarrel on either &s;ide, who may &s;till have very con&s;iderable Relations, de&s;cended from them, now alive, makes the Task Invidious, as well as Difficult.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant that there are Accounts, contained in this following Hi&s;tory, of &s;ome Eminent Per&s;ons in tho&s;e times, that do not agree with the relations we have met with of the &s;ame Per&s;ons, publi&s;hed in other Authors. But, be&s;ides that they who put forth this Hi&s;tory, dare not take upon them to make any Al|terations in a work of this kind, &s;olemnly left with them to be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> publi&s;hed, when ever it &s;hould be publi&s;hed, as it was delivered to them; they cannot but think the world will generally be of opi|nion, that others may as likely have been mi&s;taken in the grounds, and informations they have gone upon, as our Author; who will be e&s;teem'd to have had opportunities, equal at lea&s;t with any others, of knowing the truth; and, by the candor, and impartiality of
<PB N="III" REF="80">
what he relates, may be believed not to have made any wilful mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>However, all things of this Nature mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted, as this is, with great deference to the judgement of the equal Reader; who will meet, in his progre&s;s through this work, with many Pa&s;&s;ages, that, he will judge, may di&s;oblige the Po&s;terity of even well mean|ing Men in tho&s;e days; much more then of &s;uch as were crafty, cunning, and wicked enough to de&s;ign the mi&s;chiefs that en&s;ued: But he &s;hall meet with none of Malice, nor any but &s;uch as the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Author, upon his be&s;t information, took to be Impartially true. He could not be ignorant of the Rules of a good Hi&s;torian (which, <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, <HI>are &s;uch foundations, that they are known to every body) That he &s;hould Not dare to &s;peak any Fal&s;e|hood; and &s;hould dare to &s;peak any Truth.</HI> And We doubt not, but through the whole progre&s;s of this Hi&s;tory, he will be found to have given no occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;pecting his writings <HI>guilty of par|tial favour, or unju&s;t enmity;</HI> and we hope, that the repre|&s;enting the Truth, without any mixture of private Pa&s;&s;ion or Animo&s;ity, will be &s;o far from giving offence to any Ingenuous Man <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of this time, that it will be received rather as an In&s;truction to the pre&s;ent Age, than a Reproach upon the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Tenderne&s;s that might &s;eem due, out of Charity, good Manners, and good Nature, to our Country Men, our Neigh|bours, or our Relations, hath been indulged a long &s;pace of time; and might po&s;&s;ibly be abu&s;ed, if it &s;hould not give way, at la&s;t, to the u&s;efulne&s;s of making this work publick, in an Age, when &s;o many Memoirs, Narratives, and pieces of Hi&s;tory come out, as it were on purpo&s;e to ju&s;tify the taking up Armes again&s;t that King, and to blacken, revile, and ridicule the &s;acred Maje&s;ty of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> an Anointed head in di&s;tre&s;s; and when &s;o much of the Sen&s;e of Religion to God, and of Allegiance and Duty to the Crown, is &s;o defaced, that it is already, within little more than fifty Years &s;ince the Murther committed on that Pious Prince, by &s;ome Men made a My&s;tery to judge, on who&s;e &s;ide was the Right, and on which the Rebellion is to be charged.</P>
<P>We hope therefore it will be judged nece&s;&s;ary as well as u&s;eful,
<PB N="IV" REF="90">
that an impartial Account of the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e unhappy times &s;hould at la&s;t come out; and that We &s;hall have the general Approbation, for having contributed thus far to Awaken Men to that Hone&s;ty, Ju&s;tice, Loyalty, and Piety, which formerly Engli&s;h Men have been valuable for, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible any Government, Di&s;cipline, or Authority can be long maintain'd.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but this good King had &s;ome Infirmities, and Imperfections; and might thereby be mi&s;led into &s;ome mi&s;takes in Government, which the Nation, in Parliament repre&s;ented, might <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> have reformed by moderate and peaceful Coun&s;els. But the Re|formation lo&s;t it's Name, and it's Nature too, when &s;o many Acts, pa&s;&s;ed by him in Parliament, that did re&s;train the Prerogative of the Crown from doing the Mi&s;chiefs it had been taxed with, had not the effect they ought to have met with, of re&s;training the People too from farther demands; and when the inordinate Am|bition, Anger, and Revenge of &s;ome of the great Leaders could not be limited within any Bounds, till they had involved the Na|tion in Blood, de&s;troyed many Thou&s;ands of their own Country Men, and fellow Citizens, and brought at la&s;t their own Soveraign to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> lo&s;e his Head on a Scaffold, under a pretended form of an High Court of Ju&s;$ice, unprecedented from the Beginning of the World; and, to fini&s;h their work, had overthrown all the Laws of their own Country, in the defence of which, they would have had it thought, they had been obliged to draw their Swords.</P>
<P>Without que&s;tion, every body, that &s;hall duly con&s;ider the whole Account of the&s;e Tran&s;actions, will be able to impute mi&s;takes, mi&s;carriages, and faults enough to both &s;ides: And we &s;hall leave them to their own &s;edate and compo&s;ed Reflections. But We can|not omit making this one Ob&s;ervation, that where any King by ill <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Judgement, or ill Fortune, of his own, or tho&s;e entru&s;ted by him in the chief admini&s;tration of his Government, happens to fall into an Intere&s;t contrary to that of his People, and will pur&s;ue that mi&s;take, that Prince mu&s;t have terrible conflicts in the cour&s;e of his Reign, which way &s;oever the Controver&s;y ends: On the other hand, that People, who, tho' invaded and oppre&s;&s;ed in their just Rights and
<PB N="V" REF="100">
Liberties, &s;hall not re&s;t &s;atisfied with rea&s;onable reparations and &s;ecurities, but, having got power into their hands, will make un|ju&s;tifiable U&s;e of it, to the utter Subver&s;ion of that Government they are bound in Duty and Allegiance to &s;upport, do but at last make Rods for their own Backs, and very often bring upon them|&s;elves, from other hands, a more &s;evere Bondage than that they had &s;hook off.</P>
<P>To demonstrate this General Ob&s;ervation, let it be con&s;ider'd in Particular, what was the Advantage this poor Nation gain'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> from all the Victories obtain'd over King <HI>Charles</HI> in the Field, and, afterwards, in the impri&s;oning, and pro&s;ecuting him to death: What amends did it make for the Infringement and Prejudice, they complain'd of, in their Rights and Liberties, to &s;et up the Protector <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who, under a thou&s;and Artifices and Cruelties, in|tended no other Reformation, but, instead of Whips, to chasti&s;e the poor People with Scorpions; and, in&s;tead of their Idol Common-wealth, which &s;ome had vainly imagined to them&s;elves, to make him&s;elf that very hated thing, a King, which had been &s;o abomi|nable in his own &s;ight? And after him, what did all the other &s;e|veral <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;orts of Government, &s;et up &s;ometimes to gratify the Am|bition of one Party, and &s;ometimes of another, end in, but &s;o many &s;everal ways of Oppre&s;&s;ion; which, after many Years &s;pent in exhau&s;ting the Blood and Trea&s;ure of their Country, at length made way for the happy Re&s;toration of the Son, and Family of that King (whom they had &s;o barbarou&s;ly brought to an untimely end) with the utmo&s;t &s;corn and deri&s;ion of all that had pretended to Rule in his &s;tead?</P>
<P>Here We might de&s;cend into Particulars, to make out the other part of our Ob&s;ervation, by giving In&s;tances, how &s;ome of our own <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Kings have, unhappily, been led into very dangerous mistakes in their Government; and how many Years have pa&s;&s;ed almost in one perpetual Strife, and unfortunate contention between the Prince and the People, in Points of the highest con&s;equence; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e, which have brought the Prince, &s;ometimes, under the di&s;ad|vantageous &s;u&s;picion of being inclined to the love of Arbitrary Power, and favouring the Popi&s;h Religion; than which the most
<PB N="VI" REF="110">
mortal Enemys to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly contrive, or wi&s;h, more mi&s;erable circum&s;tances for it to be involved in. But We are rather de&s;irous to draw a Veil over all the Calamities, that have proceeded from this Cau&s;e; as well becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ions tho&s;e mi&s;takes have made, and the marks they have left behind them, will not ea&s;ily be worn out; as that it might look like in&s;ult|ing over Their misfortunes, who have been the Chief Lo&s;ers by them; which We have, in no kind, the Inclination, or the Heart to do: Neither would we be thought to give Countenance, by what We write, to the opinions of tho&s;e, who would Ju&s;tify the ri&s;ing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> up in Armes of Subjects, to do them&s;elves Right in any Controver&s;y between them and their King.</P>
<Q><L>Non haec in foedera&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The Nature of our excellent Government hath provided, in the Con&s;titution of it, other remedies, in a Parliamentary way; where|in both the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Rights of the Peo|ple may be better &s;ecured: And be&s;ides, we know to whom Ven|geance peculiarly belongs, and that he who challenges that power to Him&s;elf, will not &s;uffer it to be communicated to any other. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>But We &s;hould think our &s;elves very fortunate, if, in the Re|flections we have been making on this Subject, We have repre&s;ented the truth, on both &s;ides, with that fairne&s;s and Impartiality, in the perplex'd condition of our own affairs, that all Princes may &s;ee and judge, that it can never turn to their advantage, to be in an Intere&s;t contrary to that of their People, nor to give their Subjects unrea&s;onable Provocations. For (as in other Ca&s;es, where the Laws both of God and Man are too often broken, tho' very &s;trict and po&s;itive, &s;o in this point too) the People may not always be re&s;trained from attempting by force to do them&s;elves Right, tho' <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> they Ought not.</P>
<P>And we hope no le&s;s, that the People will be convinced, that it were wi&s;er, and better for them, to obtain the redre&s;s of their grievances by &s;uch ways, as the ancient Laws of this Kingdom have provided: And that the Con&s;titution of King, Lords, and Commons, is the happie&s;t Compo&s;ition of Government in the world;
<PB N="VII" REF="120">
and &s;o &s;uited to the Nature of Engli&s;h men generally, that tho' it be expelled for a time, yet it will return.</P>
<P>We would therefore heartily wi&s;h both for Prince and People, if either of them &s;hould be guilty of any irregular Deviations from their own Channels, that they who are injured would content them&s;elves with gentle Applications, and moderate Remedies, le$t the la&s;t error be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t: And above all, that who&s;o|ever may have a thought of Ruling in this Land, may be throughly convinced in his own judgement, that it is a Crown of Briers and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Thorns that mu&s;t be &s;et on his head, without he can &s;atisfy all rea&s;onable Men, that it is his fixed Principle and Re&s;olution, in|violably to defend our Religion, and pre&s;erve our Laws.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, We have often wonder'd, and re&s;t &s;till amazed, that any Prince &s;hould care to govern a People again&s;t their Nature, their Inclinations, and their Laws. What Glory can it be to a Prince of a great Spirit, to &s;ubdue, and break the hearts of his own Subjects, with whom he &s;hould live properly as a Shepherd with his Flock? If two Lovers, who &s;hould pa&s;s their time in renewing, repeating, and returning all the Offices of Friend|&s;hip, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> kindne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and love, were, in&s;tead of that, unluckily contriving always to cro&s;s, oppo&s;e, and torment one another, what could be the effect of &s;uch a Conver&s;ation, but Vexation and An|gui&s;h in the beginning, a &s;hort lived Corre&s;pondence, and Hatred and Contempt in the Conclu&s;ion?</P>
<P>Our Con&s;titution is the main Point ever to be regarded; which, God be prai&s;ed, hath been pre&s;erved through &s;o many Ages. For tho' there have been &s;ome Men often found, and of great parts too, who, for their private advantages, are aiding, &s;ometimes the Mo|narch, and &s;ometimes the Party that would be a Common-wealth, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> under &s;pecious Pretences for the Publick Good, to exceed the Li|mits the Con&s;titution hath pre&s;cribed in this Country; yet the Na|tion &s;till finds, in all Ages, &s;ome truly Publick Spirits, that pre|&s;erve it from being long impo&s;ed upon. There is a craft and a per|petual &s;ubtilty, that Men of private intere&s;t mu&s;t work with to &s;upport their own de&s;igns: But the true Intere&s;t of the Kingdom is the plaine&s;t thing in the world: It is what every Body in <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="VIII" REF="130">
finds and feels, and knows to be Right, and they are not long a finding it neither. This is that Intere&s;t, that is &s;upported <HI>Non tam fama, quam &s;ua vi;</HI> it's own weight &s;till keeps it &s;teddy again&s;t all the Storms, that can be brought to beat upon it, either from the Ignorance of Strangers to our Con&s;titution, or the Violence of any, that project to them&s;elves wild Notions of appealing to the People out of Parliament (a Parliament &s;itting) as it were to a fourth E&s;tate of the Realm; and calling upon them to come and take their &s;hare in the direction of the publick, and mo&s;t important Con&s;ultations. This We conceive to be another way of under|mining <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the ancient and true Con&s;titution, but not like to be more effectual than &s;ome others, that have been tried before; &s;ince We have the experience that no violence, nor almo&s;t ruin, hath, hitherto, hinder'd it from &s;ettling again upon it's old foundation.</P>
<P>There hath been, within the compa&s;s of few years, much Talk, and, God knows, too many ill Effects too, of Factions in this King|dom; and We have lived, in our days, to &s;ee the two great Par|ties, of late known by the Names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> directly change their ground; and tho&s;e, who were formerly the Anti-Courtiers, become as pliant and ob&s;equious, as ever They were, who <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> had been the mo&s;t found fault with on that &s;core. But We are humbly of opinion, that, at this time of day, neither of tho&s;e Par|ties have the Game in their hands, as they have formerly perhaps fancied to them&s;elves. But they, who &s;hall be &s;o hone&s;t, and &s;o wi&s;e, con&s;tantly to prefer the true Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to that of any other Country or People, pre&s;erve the Religion and the Laws, protect and promote the Trade of the Nation, thriftily and provi|dently admini&s;ter the publick Trea&s;ure, and study to maintain the Soveraignty of our Seas, &s;o naturally, &s;o anciently, and &s;o ju&s;tly the true defence of this Kingdom; that Body, whom&s;oever it &s;hall <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> be compo&s;ed of, &s;hall have the Weight of <HI>England</HI> on it's &s;ide; and if there can be any of another frame, they must, in the end, prove &s;o many mi&s;erable rotten Reeds.</P>
<P>Well may other Princes, and States, who&s;e Situation requires it for their own Security, find it their Interest, for the pre&s;erva|tion of their Credit and Reputation amongst their Neighbours, to
<PB N="IX" REF="140">
keep con&s;tantly in pay great Numbers of Land Forces; in which they are &s;till vying one with the other, and boa&s;ting who can rai&s;e his Thou&s;ands, and who his ten Thou&s;ands: but they will be found but young States-men for Our Government, who can think it ad|vi&s;eable, that the Strength of this I&s;land &s;hould be mea&s;ured by Proportions &s;o un&s;uitable to it's true Glory, and Greatne&s;s. As well might <HI>David</HI> have thought it requi&s;ite, when he was to en|counter the great Giant of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> that He likewi&s;e mu&s;t have had a Staff to his Spear like a Weavers Beam. But that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <HI>Man after Gods own heart</HI> thought it more expedient to his ad|vantage over the Enemy, he was to contend with, to come against him with Armes that he had tried, and that he could weild.

degree, of a Favourite too, this excellent Man made, for about two years after the Re&s;toration of the King his Ma&s;ter, who, during that time, relied entirely on his Advice, and Conduct. There were indeed &s;ome other Great and Wi&s;e Men, whom the King, for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, con&s;ulted in his weightie&s;t Affairs. There was the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> then Lord High Trea|&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> with whom our Author had always an entire and fa&s;t Friend&s;hip, and whom all Men, that knew him, honour'd for his great Abilities, and eminent Integrity. There was the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> then Lord General, who had the honour, and good Fortune of bringing mo&s;t things, and Men at that time to bear together, for the Re&s;toration of that King, and the Royal Family to the Seat of their Ance&s;tors. There was the then Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> &s;oon after his Maje&s;ty's Return made Lord Steward of the Hou&s;e-hold, and Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who had, not only followed, but even graced his Ma&s;ters Fortunes, in all the time of his Exile, with the Attendance of &s;o eminent, and meritorious a Subject; who had often ventured his Per&s;on, and lo&s;t all his Large E&s;tate in the &s;teady pur&s;uit of Loyalty and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Duty to the Crown, and Zeal for the true Religion. There was the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who had, when Admiral, and General at Sea, to his &s;hare the glorious part of bringing the Fleet of <HI>England,</HI> and the Body of the Engli&s;h Sea-men, to concur in the King's Re|storation; and had, before that time, been very meritorious to|wards his Maje&s;ty, as is mention'd at large in the en&s;uing parts of this Hi&s;tory. The&s;e were the principal; and be&s;ides the&s;e, there was one more, who, tho' in a different rank, was admitted, at that time, into the mo&s;t intimate Tru&s;t and Confidence, Old Se|cretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> who had &s;erved his two Ma&s;ters, King <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> <HI>Charles</HI> the first and &s;econd, with &s;o much Faithfulne&s;s and Integrity, as to be ju&s;tly entitled to a part in the most important Admini&s;tration. But, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign of detracting from the Credit or Interest of the&s;e great, and honourable Per&s;ons, We may truly &s;ay, our Author had the preference of them all in the King's Favour and E&s;teem; and by his prudence, knowledge, and experience, in which he &s;hared with the others, and his

Indefatigable Labour and Pains, wherein, it is mo&s;t certain, they did not &s;hare with Him, he had the Happine&s;s, without their Envy, and with their Concurrence, to have the greatest &s;hare in di&s;po&s;ing the minds of the People, and the King too, to agree then on &s;uch mea&s;ures in Parliament, as laid the foundation of that Peace, Plenty, and Pro&s;perity this Nation hath enjoyed &s;ince.</P>
<P>He had the happine&s;s to have the greatest &s;hare in pre&s;erving the Constitution of our Government entire, when the Then pre|&s;ent Temper of the People, was but too ready to have gone into <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> any undue complyance with the Crown.</P>
<P>He had the happine&s;s, amongst &s;everal other good Acts of Par|liament, to have the greate&s;t &s;hare in compa&s;&s;ing and perfecting the Act of Oblivion, and Indemnity; the Act for confirming Judi|cial Proceedings; and the Act of Uniformity; by which the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> were quieted in their Minds, and &s;ettled in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the Church of <HI>England</HI> redeem&punc;d from the op|pre&s;&s;ions it had lain under, and e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;et up by the Law of the Land, as it was al&s;o by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviours promi&s;e to all tho&s;e, that &s;erve him in Holine&s;s and Truth, on that Rock, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> against which the Gates of Hell were not to prevail. This is that Church, which de&s;ires to have her Doctrine under&s;tood, as well as obeyed; and which depends on the Infallibility of Scripture for her Guide, but never could be drawn to allow it to any Mor|tal Men, whether in a &s;ingle Per&s;on, or a greater Number; and which, of all the Churches in the World, does mo&s;t rational|ly inform her Members in the Practice of pure Religion and un|defiled towards God, with Decency in Wor&s;hip, without Af|fectation, Super&s;tition, or O&s;tentation; and Obedience to the King, with due Regard to the Constitution, and the Laws of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Land. By Gods ble&s;&s;ing on the&s;e means, our Author had the hap|pine&s;s to leave la&s;ting Monuments of his Judgement, and his Pie|ty; of his Loyalty to his Prince; and his entire Love to his Country.</P>
<P>It was during the Mini&s;try of this Per&s;on, and whil&s;t he was in his greate&s;t Credit, that memorable Expre&s;&s;ion was u&s;ed, in one of

King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econds Speeches to both Hou&s;es: That in all his Deliberations and Actions, his principal Con&s;ideration &s;hould be, What will a Parliament think of them?</P>
<P>Every Body then knew, by who&s;e Advice that King was in|clined to make that wi&s;e Declaration. And certainly it had been happy for him, if he had always practi&s;ed it; and all <HI>England</HI> hath Rea&s;on to wi&s;h, that all Mini&s;ters had continued, to this day, to give the like whole&s;ome Coun&s;el.

<P>How this Per&s;on came fir&s;t to le&s;&s;en in his Credit, and after|wards, in the &s;pace of about five years, to fall quite out of that Kings favour, to be Di&s;graced, as the Language at Court is, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and Bani&s;hed, mu&s;t be a little touched; and We &s;hall make an end. They who were then mo&s;t concern'd in his Misfortunes, and felt the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;trokes of his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure in their Family, have it not in their hearts to lay any thing hard at the Door of that King, once a mo&s;t gracious, and indulgent Ma&s;ter to our Author, and who was certainly not of a Di&s;po|&s;ition to do har&s;h things to any Body; and who, as We have Rea|&s;on to believe, out of the &s;en&s;e of unkind U&s;age to the Father, did afterwards, by his own &s;ingular goodne&s;s and favour, much again&s;t the mind of &s;ome in Credit with him, draw his two Sons, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> who yet Survive, into a very great degree of Tru&s;t, and Confi|dence near him; and particularly bestowed on the &s;econd, ex|traordinary marks of Honour and Bounty, that are to de&s;cend to his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We take them both to be men of &s;o much Piety to their Father, and &s;o much Spirit in them&s;elves, that they would, by no means, be bribed to omit any thing upon this occa&s;ion, that might be of U&s;e or

Advantage to the honour of one they owe &s;o much Duty to; if they could conceive, that there was need, at this time of day, to contri|bute to the Ju&s;tification of his Innocency. The world hath la&s;ted long enough, &s;ince the Misfortunes of this honourable Per&s;on, to be throughly convinced, that there was nothing in all tho&s;e Ar|ticles exhibited again&s;t him in Parliament, that did in the lea&s;t touch or concern him. One of his Sons, then of the Hou&s;e of Commons, offer'd in that Hou&s;e, that if they, who accu&s;ed him, would but take the Pains to prove to the Hou&s;e any one of the Articles, and take which they would, if they made out but any <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> one of them all, Him&s;elf, and all his Friends, would acknowledge him guilty of all.</P>
<P>But there is no need now of the vindication of &s;uch a Man, whom every Body, in their con&s;ciences, do not only acquit of any crime, but all Good Men &s;peak of with honour; and who still lives in the opinion of all true Engli&s;h Men, in as high a Repu|tation as any Man to this day.</P>
<P>Yet, altho' We intend to decline all manner of Reflection on the Memory of that King, We may be allow'd to &s;ay, That that ex|cellently well natured Prince, who did very few ill natured things <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in his Reign, was prevailed upon, in this ca&s;e, not only to put out of his Service one of the mo&s;t Faithful and Ancient Servants then alive to his Father, or Him&s;elf (which is not to be &s;o much com|plain'd of; for it would be a hard Tie indeed for a Prince to be, as it were, Married to his Servants for better, for wor&s;e) but to con&s;ent to an Act of Parliament, that obliged this his poor Servant to end his days in Bani&s;hment, with old Age and Infirmities to attend him: This might be thought a little hard-hearted to inflict upon a Man, who had the honour and happine&s;s, in the more vi|gorous part of his Life, to have led the King him&s;elf through his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> own Exile, with Credit and Dignity, and in more Honour and Reputation, than u&s;ually attends Unfortunate Princes, that are deprived of their own Dominions; and at la&s;t, in the fulne&s;s of Gods own Time, had the happine&s;s to have &s;o con&s;iderable a&s;hare in the Conduct of his Restoration. For it was by this Author principally, that the continual corre&s;pondence was kept up with
<PB N="XVII" REF="220">
the Loyal Party in <HI>England,</HI> in order to cultivate good thoughts of his Maje&s;ty in the minds of his People, and to bring them, in &s;ome &s;ort, acquainted with his Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition, before they could know his Per&s;on. This Author likewi&s;e framed, di&s;po&s;ed, and drew tho&s;e Letters and Declarations from <HI>Breda,</HI> which had &s;o wonderful an Effect all over <HI>England,</HI> and were &s;o generally approved here, that they were, almo&s;t all, turn'd into Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>Many perhaps may not unrea&s;onably believe, that the Mar|riage <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of the then Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the Daughter of this Author might have been one great occa&s;ion, if not the Founda|tion of his Fall; and tho' it be mo&s;t undoubtedly true, that this very unequal Allyance was brought to pa&s;s entirely without the knowledge, or Privity of this Author, but &s;o much the contrary, that when the King, at that time, made him more than ordi|nary expre&s;&s;ions of his Grace to him, with A&s;&s;urances that this Accident &s;hould not le&s;&s;en the E&s;teem, and Favour his Maje&s;ty had for him; yet his own good Judgement made him immediate|ly &s;en&s;ible, and declare it too, to tho&s;e he was intimate with, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> that this mu&s;t certainly be the occa&s;ion of the diminution of his Credit.</P>
<P>The continual dropping of Water does not more infallibly make an hollow in a Stone, than the perpetual Whi&s;pers of ill Men mu&s;t make impre&s;&s;ion in the heart of any Prince, that will al|ways lie open to hear them; nor can any Man's mind be &s;uf|ficiently guarded from the influence of continued Calumny, and Back-biting.</P>
<P>When the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had made this Marriage, it was not unnatural to tho&s;e ill minded Men to &s;ugge&s;t, that, for the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> time to come, that Mini&s;ter would be contriving Advantages for the good of his own Po&s;terity, to the prejudice of his Soveraign, and Ma&s;ter. What their wickedne&s;s, po&s;&s;ibly, would have allow'd Them to practice, was ground enough to them for an Accu&s;ation of His Innocency.</P>
<P>It was true that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was become the Chan|cellor's Son in Law; and therefore they hoped to be believed,

when they &s;aid, that to &s;atisfy his Ambition, he would forfeit his Integrity; which, God knows, was Not true.</P>
<P>Thus what <HI>Tacitus</HI> ob&s;erves in the time of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> of <HI>Granius Marcellus,</HI> who was inform'd again&s;t to have &s;poken ill words of that Emperour, was here, in &s;ome &s;ort, verified on our Author:</P>
<P>Inevitabile crimen, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Tacitus <HI>concerning tho&s;e words,</HI> nam, quia vera erant, etiam dicta credebantur.</P>
<P>The Allyance was undeniable; there were Children born of it; and the King was not ble&s;&s;ed with any from his Marriage. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> An inevitable crime laid on our Author. For, becau&s;e it was true, that there were Children from one Marriage, and not from the other, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that both Marriages had been &s;o con|trived by the Chancellor: tho' the King knew very well, that his own Marriage had not been fir&s;t projected, or propo&s;ed by this Author; and that he had often told his Maje&s;ty, what &s;u&s;picions there were in the world, that that great and virtuous Prince&s;s might prove unfruitful.</P>
<P>Another inevitable Misfortune, which was then laid as a Crime too on our Author, was a Report very fal&s;ely, but very <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, that fir&s;t begat a Coldne&s;s, and, by degrees, very much di&s;inclined a great many of the Royal Party to him; a Report, that he &s;hould have in&s;tilled into the King's mind a Principle, that he mu&s;t prefer his Enemies, and advance Them, to gain them to be his Friends; and for his Old Friends, it was no matter how he u&s;ed Them, for They would be &s;o still. To which very &s;candalous mi&s;repre&s;entation We must give this true An&s;wer:</P>
<P>It fell out indeed, that every Man's Expectation, that had laboured all the heat of the day in the Vine-yard, who had re|ceived <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> wounds in their Per&s;ons in the day of Battle, or &s;uffer'd in their Fortunes or Liberties, for the pre&s;ervation of a good con&s;cience during the U&s;urpation of Tyranny and Anarchy, was not, and, alas! could not, be recompenced immediately according to their Merit, or the Hopes they had entertained: And be|cau&s;e it was true that they were di&s;appointed, it was believed
<PB N="XIX" REF="240">
by &s;ome of them, that our Author, being Mini&s;ter at that time, had in&s;tilled this damnable Doctrine and Po&s;ition, that it was no matter how the King u&s;ed his Old Friends: and becau&s;e it was true that they were not con&s;idered as they de&s;erved, it mu&s;t be believed, as they would have it, that He was the Author of that Advice.</P>
<P>It was true that the King, who was &s;o wonderfully re&s;tored with all that Glory and Peace, more perhaps upon the confi|dence of his Declarations and Promi&s;es from <HI>Breda,</HI> than any <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> other Humane means, and who had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to re|commend, in his mo&s;t gracious Speech to both Hou&s;es, upon the pa&s;&s;ing the Act of Indemnity, that all marks of di&s;tinction and divi&s;ion amongst his Subjects, &s;hould be for ever buried and for|gotten, did not think it for his Honour, and true Interest, to Reign over a Party only of his Subjects; and therefore, imme|diately after his Restoration, in order to the Settlement of his Court, and Family, the then Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e part every body remember'd to have been very eminent, in the time of the Rebellion, again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, but who had in|du&s;triou&s;ly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> applied him&s;elf &s;everal years to the King, to make re|paration for his former Errors, and had been con&s;iderably &s;er|viceable to him in &s;everal occa&s;ions, was honoured with the Of|fice of Lord Chamberlain of the Hou&s;e-hold; to let the King|dom &s;ee, how the King Him&s;elf began with practi&s;ing what he exhorted his Subjects to, that admirable Art of Forgetful|ne&s;s, when he put Such a per&s;on into &s;o eminent a Station in the Government, near his own Per&s;on. And it was certainly of Advantage to the King, in the beginning of his &s;ettlement here, as well as a Mark of Ju&s;tice in his Nature, to let his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Subjects know and feel, that every one of them might capaci|tate him&s;elf, by his future behaviour, for any Dignity and Pre|ferment.</P>
<P>But it could never be in the Heart of a Man, who had been all along on the &s;uffering &s;ide, to do his own Party &s;o ba&s;e an Office with the King, as this fal&s;e Report did in&s;inuate. He might be of opinion that the fatted Calf was to be killed, for the
<PB N="XX" REF="250">
entertainment of the Prodigal Son, whenever he returned; that there might be no distinction of Parties kept up among$t Us; but he could never forget the Birthright of the Elde&s;t Son, who had &s;erved the King &s;o many years, and had not at any time tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his commandment, and &s;o well de&s;erved that prai&s;e, and that reward, <HI>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</HI> And yet this Calumny, fal&s;e as it was, was another inevitable Crime, or at lea&s;t Misfortune. For without that opinion, which &s;ome of the Royal Party had &s;ucked in, that the Chancellor had abandon'd their Intere&s;t, it had been impo&s;&s;i|ble <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to have engaged a Majority in that Parliament, to have con|&s;ented to that Act of Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>God forgive the Inventors and Contrivers of that foul Ca|lumny: But, by his Almighty Providence, who from Heaven re|veals Secrets, it was not long before that Party was di&s;abu&s;ed. For, tho' the Chancellor, for &s;ome time, bore the blame, that they had not been more con&s;idered, it was quickly found, that it was not from Him, but from the mi&s;taken Politicks of the new States|men, that they were de&s;ign'd to be neglected. Nor did they at all find them&s;elves more taken notice of, after his Removal; nor have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the &s;everal other Parties in the Kingdom, that have been che|ri&s;hed, and countenanced in oppo&s;ition to this, much declined, as We conceive, to this day.</P>
<P>But after all, We are humbly of opinion, that it was neither of the&s;e above mention'd unavoidable Misfortunes, nor both toge|ther, that gave the fatal, and la&s;t deci&s;ive blow to the fortune of this good Man. The King had too good a Judgement, and was too well natured, to have been impo&s;ed upon barely by &s;uch Attacks as the&s;e; which he knew very well him&s;elf, as to our Authors guilt in them, were Frivolous and Unju&s;t. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>But there are always in Courts &s;ecret Engines, that Actually con&s;ummate the Mi&s;chiefs, that others, in a more publick way, have been long in bringing to pa&s;s: And in this ca&s;e there were two principal ones:</P>
<P>The One, the Intere&s;t of &s;ome of the Zealots of the Popi&s;h Par|ty, who knew this Mini&s;ter had too much Credit in the Nation, tho'
<PB N="XXI" REF="260">
he &s;hould lo&s;e it with the King, to &s;uffer the Projects, they perpe|tually had, of propagating their Religion, to take effect, whil&s;t he &s;hould be in the Kingdom:</P>
<P>The Other, the Faction of the Ladys, too prevalent at that time with the King, who were afraid of &s;uch a Mans being near him, as dur&s;t talk to him, as he had &s;everal times taken the Li|berty to do, of the &s;candal of their lives, and reprove both the Master and the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, for their publick unlawful Con|ver&s;ations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Thus the&s;e two Intere&s;ts, joyning their Forces, were &s;o power|ful, that there was no re&s;i&s;ting them, by a Man, who could not make Court to Either. And &s;o he fell a Sacrifice to the Ambi|tion, and Malice of all &s;orts of Enemies, who were de&s;irous of getting new places to them&s;elves in the Court, and of trying new Inventions in the State.</P>
<P>And yet it is to be ob&s;erved, that that King, who was, almo&s;t all his Reign, ever labouring, with much pains to get a little Ea&s;e, which he might perhaps have attained with le&s;s trouble, and, no doubt, hoped, by getting rid of this old importunate Coun|&s;ellor, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to terrify any Man from pre&s;uming afterwards to tell him &s;uch bold Truths, had &s;carce ever after any Serenity in his whole Reign: But tho&s;e very Women, or others in their places, and the Factions he him&s;elf had given countenance to, grew too hard for him, and tore him almo&s;t to pieces, &s;ometimes in the favouring of one Party, and &s;ometimes of another, without &s;teady|ne&s;s of his own, or confidence enough in any of his Servants, to guide him through tho&s;e perplexities, that could not have been brought upon him, but by his own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>We dare &s;ay, there were &s;ome hours in his life, that he wi&s;h'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> he had had his old Chancellor again; who, he knew, was a more skilful Pilot than any of his new Sates-men;
<Q><L>(Tempus erit, magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum)</L></Q></P>
<P>And that he had not, by his too much eagerne&s;s to get rid of one old Servant, given too great an handle to have new Mea&s;ures,
<PB N="XXII" REF="270">
and new Coun&s;els, &s;o often impo&s;ed upon him, throughout the whole remaining part of his life.</P>
<P>Thus We have fini&s;hed our Preface, which We thought in|cumbent on us to make, who had lived to be acquainted with this Author, and to have known his merit, that it might at|tend the publi&s;hing this Hi&s;tory, to give the pre&s;ent Age &s;ome in|formation of the Character of him, they are to read. And as we de&s;ired to perform it with re&s;pect to his Memory, &s;o, We hope, We have not exceeded the bounds of truth, and modesty, which he him|&s;elf would have taken unkindly from tho&s;e, that are doing this <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Office to him. Whatever Misfortunes he might have in his life; whatever Enemies he might have had; or whatever Errors he might have committed (which few Men in his high Stations e&s;cape quite clear of) We pre&s;ume to think he de&s;erves, from all im|partial Men, the prai&s;e of an hone&s;t, ju&s;t, and able Servant to the Church and Crown, and to be ranked amongst the great and good Mini&s;ters of State.</P>
<P><HI>And now We will conclude all, with a thank&s;giving to God in Saint</HI> Luke, Glory be to God on high, and on Earth peace, good will, towards Men. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>For Gods name ought ever to be glorified in all his di&s;pen&s;a|tions; whether they be attended with the Pro&s;perities, or Ad|ver&s;ities of this pre&s;ent World. We &s;peak it knowingly, that our Noble Author did &s;o throughout the Cour&s;e of his Misfortunes, and that he did adore, and magnify Gods holy Name, for all his Mercies &s;o plentifully be&s;towed upon him; and particularly for giving him the Courage, and Virtue, con&s;tantly to act and &s;uffer honourably through all the con&s;iderable Emploiments of his life; and, more e&s;pecially, to endeavour to keep things even between the King and the People (the everla&s;ting labour of a faithful Ser|vant) <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> rather than advance his own favour, by unrea&s;onably ad|vancing the Prerogative on the one hand, or his credit, by court|ing the Popular Intere&s;t, on the other; which We heartily wi&s;h, all Men, in the highe&s;t Authority under a King of <HI>England,</HI> may ever remember to practice.</P>
<P>And whoever are acquainted with the Sons of this Noble
<PB N="XXIII" REF="280">
Author, must do them this ju&s;tice to own, they have often de|clared, that they have found them&s;elves as well the better Chri|&s;tians, as the better Men, for the afflicted, as well as pro&s;perous parts of their Fathers Life; which hath taught them, to be the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed with the various turns, they have met with in the Cour&s;e of their own. With Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> they <HI>have learnt to know how to be exalted, and how to be aba&s;ed.</HI> This as Christians: And with <HI>Horace,</HI> who attributes more to Fortune, they have learnt to have always in their minds,
<MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <Q><L>Laudo manentem, &s;i celeres quatit</L>
<L>Pennas, Re&s;igno quae dedit.</L></Q></P>
<P>And having thus glorified God on high, that they may do all in them lies, towards promoting Peace on Earth, they do very heartily declare, and profe&s;s good Will towards all Men; and bear no unkindne&s;s to any, that were the Contrivers of the unde|&s;erved Misfortunes of their Noble Father.</P>

the Weak to contribute to the de&s;igns of the Wicked, and &s;uffering even tho&s;e, by degrees, out of a con&s;cience of their guilt, to grow more wicked than they intended to be; letting the Wi&s;e to be impo&s;ed upon by men of &s;mall under&s;tanding; and permitting the Innocent to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with lazine&s;s and &s;leep in the mo&s;t vi&s;ible article of danger; uniting the Ill, though of the mo&s;t different opinions, oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and di&s;tant affections, in a firm and con&s;tant league of Mi&s;cheifs; and dividing tho&s;e, who&s;e opinions and intere&s;ts are the &s;ame, into Faction and Emulation, more pernicious to the publick than the Trea&s;on of the others: whil&s;t the poor People, under pretence of Zeal to Religion, Law, Liberty, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Parliaments (words of pretious e&s;teem in their ju&s;t &s;ignification) are fu|riou&s;ly hurried into actions introducing Athei&s;m, and di&s;&s;olving all the Elements of Chri&s;tian Religion; cancelling all obligations, and de&s;troy|ing all foundations of Law and Liberty; and rendring, not only the Privileges, but the very Being of Parliaments de&s;perate and impractica|ble: I &s;ay, though the immediate finger and wrath of God mu&s;t be ac|knowledged in the&s;e perplexities and di&s;tractions; yet he who &s;hall dili|gently ob&s;erve the di&s;tempers and conjunctures of Time, the ambition, pride and folly of Per&s;ons, and the &s;uddain growth of Wickedne&s;s, from want of care and circum&s;pection in the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, will find all <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the&s;e mi&s;eries to have proceeded, and to have been brought upon us from the &s;ame natural cau&s;es, and means, which have u&s;ually attended King|doms &s;woln with long plenty, pride, and exce&s;s, towards &s;ome &s;ignal mortification, and ca&s;tigation of Heaven. And it may be, upon the con|&s;ideration how impo&s;&s;ible it was to fore&s;ee many things that have hap|pen'd, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of overlooking many other things, we may not yet find the cure &s;o de&s;perate, but that, by Gods mercy, the wounds may be again bound up; and then this pro&s;pect may not make the future Peace le&s;s plea&s;ant and durable.</P>
<P>I HAVE the more willingly induced my &s;elf to this unequal task, out <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of the hope of contributing &s;omewhat to that ble&s;&s;ed end: and though a peice of this nature (wherein the infirmities of &s;ome, and the malice of others mu&s;t be boldly look'd upon and mention'd) is not likely to be publi&s;hed in the age, in which it is writ, yet it may &s;erve to inform my &s;elf, and &s;ome others, what we ought to do, as well as to comfort us in what we have done. For which work, as I may not be thought altoge|ther an incompetent per&s;on, having been pre&s;ent as a Member of Parlia|ment in tho&s;e Councils before, and till the breaking out of the Rebellion, and having &s;ince had the Honour to be near two great Kings in &s;ome Tru&s;t, &s;o I &s;hall perform the &s;ame with all faithfulne&s;s, and ingenuity; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> with an equal ob&s;ervation of the faults and infirmities of both &s;ides, with their defects and over$ights in pur&s;uing their own ends; and &s;hall no otherwi&s;e mention &s;mall and light Occurrences, than as they have been Introductions to matters of the greate&s;t Moment, nor &s;peak of Per&s;ons otherwi&s;e, than as the mention of their Virtues or Vices is e&s;&s;ential to the work in hand: In which I &s;hall, with truth, pre&s;erve my &s;elf from the lea&s;t &s;harpne&s;s, that may proceed from private provocation, and in the whole, ob&s;erve the rules, that a man &s;hould, who de&s;erves to be beleived.</P>

<P>PARLIAMENTS were Summoned, and again Di&s;&s;olved in di&s;plea&s;ure: and that in the fourth year (after the di&s;&s;olution of the two former) was determined with a Profe&s;&s;ion, and Declaration, that, <Q>&startq;&endq;&s;ince for &s;everal ill ends the calling again of a Parliament was divulged, however his Maje&s;ty had &s;hewed, by his frequent meeting with his People, his love <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to the u&s;e of Parliaments, yet the late abu&s;e having, for the pre&s;ent, driven his Maje&s;ty unwillingly out of that cour&s;e, he &s;hall account it pre&s;umption for any to pre&s;cribe any time to his Maje&s;ty for Parlia|ments.</Q> Which words were generally interpreted, as if no more A&s;&s;em|blies of that nature were to be expected, and that all men were prohi|bited upon the penalty of cen&s;ure, &s;o much as to &s;peak of a Parliament. And here I cannot but let my &s;elf loo&s;e to &s;ay, that no man can &s;hew me a Source, from whence tho&s;e waters of bitterne&s;s, we now ta&s;te, have more probably flowed, than from the&s;e unrea&s;onable, unskilful, and precipitate Di&s;&s;olutions of Parliaments; in which, by an unju&s;t &s;urvey <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the Pa&s;&s;ion, In&s;olence, and Ambition of particular per&s;ons, the Court mea&s;ured the Temper and Affection of the Country; and by the &s;ame
<PB N="6" REF="330">
&s;tandard the People con&s;ider'd the Honour, Ju&s;tice, and Piety of the Court; and &s;o u&s;ually parted, at tho&s;e &s;ad &s;ea&s;ons, with no other re&s;pect, and charity one toward the other, than accompanies per&s;ons who never meant to meet but in their own defence. In which the King had always the di&s;advantage to harbour Per&s;ons about him, who with their utmo&s;t Indu&s;try, fal&s;e Information, and Malice, improved the faults, and in|firmities of the Court to the People; and again, as much as in them lay, rendered the People &s;u&s;pected if not odious to the King.</P>
<P>I AM not alltogether a &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e Parliaments (though I was not a Member of them) having carefully peru&s;ed the Jour|nals <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of both Hou&s;es, and familiarly conver&s;ed with many, who had prin|cipal parts in them. And I cannot but wonder at tho&s;e Coun&s;els, which per&s;waded the cour&s;es then taken; the habit and temper of mens minds, at that time, being, no que&s;tion, very applicable to the Publick ends; and tho&s;e ends being only di&s;credited by the Jealou&s;ies, the People entertain'd from the manner of the pro&s;ecution, that they were other, and wor&s;e than in truth they were. It is not to be denied, that there were, in all tho&s;e Parliaments, e&s;pecially in that of the fourth year, &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages, and di&s;tempered Speeches of particular per&s;ons, not fit for the dignity, and honour of tho&s;e places, and un&s;uitable to the Reverence due to his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Maje&s;ty and his Councils. But I do not know any formed Act of either Hou&s;e (for neither the Remon&s;trance, nor Votes of the la&s;t day were &s;uch) that was not agreeable to the Wi&s;dome, and Ju&s;tice of great Courts upon tho&s;e extraordinary occa&s;ions. And whoever con&s;iders the Acts of power, and inju&s;tice of &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, in tho&s;e intervals of Parliament, will not be much &s;candalized at the warmth, and vivacity of tho&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>IN the Second Parliament there was a mention, and intention de|clared of granting five Sub&s;idies, a proportion (how contemptible &s;oever in re&s;pect of the pre&s;&s;ures now every day impo&s;ed) &s;carce ever before <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> heard of in Parliament. And that Meeting being, upon very unpopular, and unplau&s;ible rea&s;ons, immediately Di&s;&s;olved, tho&s;e five Sub&s;idies were exacted, throughout the whole Kingdom, with the &s;ame rigour, as if, in truth, an Act had pa&s;&s;ed to that purpo&s;e: Divers Gentlemen of prime quality, in &s;everal Countys of <HI>England,</HI> were, for refu&s;ing to pay the &s;ame, committed to Pri&s;on, with great rigour and extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances. And could it be imagined, that tho&s;e men would meet again in a free convention of Parliament, without a &s;harp, and &s;evere expo&s;tulation, and inqui&s;ition into their own Right, and the power that had impo&s;ed upon that Right? And yet all the&s;e Provocations, and many <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> other, allmo&s;t of as large an extent, produced no other Re&s;entment than the Petition of Right (of no prejudice to the Crown) which was like|wi&s;e purcha&s;ed at the price of five Sub&s;idies more, and, in a very &s;hort time after that Supply granted, that Parliament was likewi&s;e, with &s;trange circum&s;tances of pa&s;&s;ion on all &s;ides, Di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THE abrupt, and unkind breaking off the Two fir&s;t Parliaments was wholely imputed to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and of the Third princi|pally to the Lord <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> then Lord high Trea&s;urer of <HI>England;</HI> both in re&s;pect of the great power, and intere&s;t they then had in the affections of his Maje&s;ty, and for that the time of the Di&s;&s;olutions happened to be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> when &s;ome Charges, and Accu&s;ations were preparing, and ready to be preferred again&s;t tho&s;e two great Per&s;ons.

<P>I WONDER le&s;s at the Errors of this nature, in the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham;</HI> who, having had a mo&s;t generous Education in Courts, was utterly Ignorant of the Ebbs, and Floods of Popular Councils, and of the Winds that move tho&s;e Waters; and could not, without the &s;pirit of Indigna|tion, find him&s;elf, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e intervening, from the greate&s;t height of popular E&s;timation, that any per&s;on hath a&s;cended to (in&s;omuch as S^r <HI>Edward Coke</HI> bla&s;phemou&s;ly call'd him our Saviour) by the &s;ame Breath thrown down to the depth of Calumny, and Reproach. I &s;ay, it is no Marvail (be&s;ides that he was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> naturally to follow &s;uch Coun&s;els as were given him) that He could think of no better way, to be freed of the&s;e inconveniences, and troubles, the Pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e Meetings gave him, than to Di&s;&s;olve them, and pre|vent their coming together: and that when they &s;eemed to neglect the Publick Peace, out of Animo&s;ity to him, he intended his own Ea&s;e and Security in the fir&s;t place, and ea&s;ily beleived, the Publick might be otherwi&s;e provided for, by more Intent, and Di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Coun&s;els. But that the other, the Lord <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> who had been very much, and very Popularly conver&s;ant in tho&s;e Conventions, who exactly knew the Frame, and Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, the temper of the People, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> the Extents of the Courts of Law, and the Juri&s;diction of Parliaments, which at that time had &s;eldom, or never committed any Exce&s;s of juri&s;|diction (Mode&s;ty and Moderation in Words never was, nor ever will be ob&s;erved in Popular Councils, who&s;e foundation is Liberty of Speech) that He &s;hould beleive, that the Union, Peace, and Plenty of the King|dom could be pre&s;erved without Parliaments, or that the Pa&s;&s;ion, and Di&s;temper gotten, and received into Parliaments, could be removed, and reformed by the more pa&s;&s;ionate Breaking and Di&s;&s;olving them; or that that Cour&s;e would not inevitably prove the mo&s;t Pernicious to him&s;elf, is as much my Wonder, as any thing that hath &s;ince happened.</P>

So that, very probably, tho&s;e two noble Per&s;ons had been happy, if they had &s;toutly &s;ubmitted to the Proceed|ings were de&s;igned again&s;t them; and, without que&s;tion, it had been of &s;overaign U&s;e to the King, if, in tho&s;e Peaceable times, Parliaments had been Taught to know their own Bounds, by being &s;uffer'd to Proceed as far as they could go; by which the Extent of their Power would quick|ly have been Manife&s;ted: from whence no Inconvenience of moment could have Proceeded; the Hou&s;e of Commons never then Pretending to the lea&s;t part of Judicature, or Exceeding the known verge of their own Privileges; the Hou&s;e of Peers ob&s;erving the Rules of the Law <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and Equity in their Judgements, and proceeding Deliberately upon clear Te&s;timony and Evidence of matter of fact; and the King retaining the &s;ole power of Pardoning, and receiving the whole profit of all Penalties and Judgements; and indeed having &s;o great an Influence upon the Body of the Peerage, that it was &s;carce known, that any Per&s;on of Ho|nour was &s;everely Cen&s;ured in that Hou&s;e (before this pre&s;ent Parlia|ment) who was not either immediately Pro&s;ecuted by the Court, or in evident Disfavour there; by which, it may be (as it u&s;ually falls out) &s;ome Doors were opened, at which Inconveniencies to the Crown have got in, that were not then enough Weighed and Con&s;idered. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>BUT the Cour&s;e of Exempting Men from Pro&s;ecution, by Di&s;&s;olving of Parliaments, made the power of Parliaments much more Formidable, as conceived to be without Limit; &s;ince the Soveraign Power &s;eemed to be compelled (as unable otherwi&s;e to &s;et Bounds to their Proceedings) to that rough Cure, and to determine their Beings, becau&s;e it could not de|termine their Juri&s;diction.

<P>HE was a younger Son of S^r <HI>George Villiers,</HI> of <HI>Brookesby</HI> in the County of <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> a Family of an ancient extraction, even from the time of the Conque&s;t, and Tran&s;ported then with the Conqueror out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> where the Family hath &s;till remained, and &s;till continues with Lu&s;tre. After S^r <HI>George</HI>'s fir&s;t marriage, in which he had two or three Sons, and &s;ome Daughters, who &s;hared an ample Inheritance from him; by a &s;econd marriage with a Lady of the Family of the <HI>Beaumonts,</HI> he had this Gentleman, and two other Sons and a Daughter, who all came afterwards to be rai&s;ed to great Titles and Dignities. <HI>George,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> elde&s;t Son of this &s;econd bed, was, after the death of his Father, by the &s;ingular affection and care of his Mother, who enjoyed a good Joyn|ture, in the account of that age, well brought up; and, for the improve|ment of his Education, and giving an ornament to his hopeful Per&s;on, he was by Her &s;ent into <HI>France;</HI> where he &s;pent two or three years in attaining the Language, and in learning the exerci&s;es of Riding and Dancing; in the la&s;t of which he excelled mo&s;t men, and returned into <HI>England</HI> by the time he was 21 years old.</P>
<P>KING <HI>James</HI> reigned at that time, and though he was a Prince of more Learning and Knowledge than any other of that age, and really <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> delighted more in Books, and in the conver&s;ation of Learned men, yet, of all Wi&s;e men living, he was the mo&s;t delighted and taken with Hand|&s;ome Per&s;ons, and with Fine Cloaths. He begun to be weary of his Fa|vourite, the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> who was the only Favourite that kept that Po&s;t &s;o long, without any publick reproach from the People. But, by the in&s;tigation and wickedne&s;s of his Wife, he became, at lea&s;t Privy to a horrible murder, that expo&s;ed him to the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the Law (the Poy&s;oning of S^r <HI>Thomas Overbury)</HI> upon which both He, and his Wife were condemned to dy, after a Tryal by their Peers, and many Per&s;ons of Quality were executed for the &s;ame.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> WHILST this was in agitation, and before the utmo&s;t di&s;covery was made, M^r <HI>Villiers</HI> appeared in Court, and drew the Kings eyes upon him.

In&s;omuch that, in few days after his fir&s;t appearance in Court, he was made Cup-bearer to the King, by which he was, of cour&s;e, to be much in his Pre&s;ence, and &s;o admitted to that conver&s;ation and di&s;cour&s;e, with which that Prince <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> always abounded at his meals.</P>
<P>His Inclinations to his new Cup-bearer di&s;po&s;ed him to admini&s;ter frequent occa&s;ions of di&s;cour&s;ing of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and the tran&s;actions there, with which he had been &s;o lately acquainted, that he could pertinently enlarge upon that Subject, to the Kings great de|light, and to the gaining the e&s;teem and value of all the &s;tanders by to Him&s;elf: which was a thing the King was well plea&s;ed with. He acted very few weeks upon this Stage, when he mounted Higher, and, being Knighted, without any other Qualification, he was at the &s;ame time made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and Knight of the Order of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Garter, and in a &s;hort time (very &s;hort for &s;uch a prodigious a&s;cent) he was made a Baron, a Vi&s;count, an Earl, a Marquis, and became Lord high Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Ma|&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and entirely di&s;po&s;ed of all the Graces of the King, in conferring all the Honours and all the Offices of three Kingdoms with|out a Rival; in di&s;pen&s;ing whereof, he was guided more by the rules of Appetite, than of Judgement, and &s;o, exalted allmo&s;t all of his own numerous Family, and Dependants; who&s;e greate&s;t Merit was their Al|liance to Him; which equally offended the ancient Nobility, and the People of all conditions, who &s;aw the Flowers of the Crown every day <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> fading, and withered; whil&s;t the Demea&s;nes, and Revenue thereof were &s;acrificed to the enriching a private Family (how well &s;oever original|ly extracted) &s;carce ever heard of before to the Nation, and the expences of the Court &s;o va&s;t and unlimited, that they had a &s;ad pro&s;pect of that Poverty, and Nece&s;&s;ity which afterwards befell the Crown, allmo&s;t to the ruin of it.</P>
<P>MANY were of opinion, that King <HI>James</HI> before his death, grew weary of this Favourite, and that, if he had lived, he would have de|prived him at lea&s;t of his large, and unlimited Power.

On the contrary, as he created him Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in his Ab&s;ence, whil&s;t he was with the Prince in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o, after their Return, the Duke executed the &s;ame Authority in conferring all Favours and Graces, and in revenging him&s;elf upon tho&s;e, who had manife&s;ted any unkindne&s;s towards him. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> And yet notwith&s;tanding all this, if that Kings nature had equally di&s;po&s;ed him to pull down, as to build and erect; and if his courage and &s;everity in puni&s;hing and reforming, had been as great, as his gene|ro&s;ity

<P>THESE Reflections were &s;o Terrible to him, that they Robbed him of all Peace and Quiet of Mind; in&s;omuch as when the Prince, and Duke came to him about the Di&s;patch, he fell into a great Pa&s;&s;ion with Tears, and told them, that he was Undone, and that it would break his heart, if they pur&s;ued their Re&s;olution; that upon a true and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;|qui&s;ition, he had made with Him&s;elf, he was abundantly convinced, that, be&s;ides the allmo&s;t inevitable Hazards of the Prince's Per&s;on, with whom his life was bound up, and be&s;ides the entire Lo&s;s of the affections <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of his People, which would unavoidably attend this ra&s;h action, he fore&s;aw, it would ruin the whole de&s;ign, and irrecoverably Break the Match.

<P>THIS Indi&s;po&s;ition of the King towards the Duke was exceedingly <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> encrea&s;ed, and aggravated, upon and after the Prince's return out of <HI>Spain.</HI> For though it brought infinite Joy and Delight to his Maje&s;ty, which he expre&s;s'd in all imaginable Tran&s;port, and was the argument of the loude&s;t, and mo&s;t univer&s;al rejoycing over the whole Kingdom, that the Nation had ever been acquainted with; in which the Duke had &s;o full a Harve&s;t, that the Imprudence, and Pre&s;umption (to &s;ay no more) of carrying the Prince into <HI>Spain</HI> was totally Forgotten, or not remem|ber'd with any Reference to him, and the high Merit and ine&s;timable Obligation, in bringing him Home, was Remember'd, Magnified, and Celebrated by all Men in all Places; Yet the King was wonderfully <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> di&s;quieted, when he found (which he had not, before their Return, &s;u&s;pected) that the Prince was totally Aliened from all thoughts of, or inclination to the Marriage, and that they were re&s;olv'd to Break it with, or without his approbation, or con&s;ent.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament is Ca$l'd af|ter the Prince's Return.</NOTE> THE King had, upon the Prince's Return, i&s;&s;ued out Writs to call a Parliament, which was in the 21^&s;^t year of his Reign, thinking it nece&s;|&s;ary, with relation to the perplexities he was in, for the Breach of this Match with <HI>Spain</HI> (which he fore&s;aw mu&s;t en&s;ue) and the Sad condition <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of his Only Daughter in <HI>Germany,</HI> with her numerous I&s;&s;ue, to receive their grave Advice.

<P>THINGS being thus concerted, after the Hou&s;es had been three or four days together (for, in that time, &s;ome days were allways &s;pent in the formality of naming Committees, and providing for common Occur|rences, before they made an entrance upon more &s;olemn Debates) the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Prince began to &s;peak of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Affairs, and of his own Journey thither, and forgot not to mention the Duke with more than ordinary affection.

<P>THE Duke no &s;ooner found the Parliament di&s;po&s;ed to a good opi|nion of him, and being well a&s;&s;ured of the Prince's fa&s;t kindne&s;s, than he projected the Ruin of this bold Rival of his; of whom he &s;aw clearly enough, that the King had &s;o good an opinion, that it would not be in his &s;ole power to cru&s;h Him, as he had done others, in the &s;ame, and as high a &s;tation.

<P>WHEN this Pro&s;ecution was fir&s;t enter'd upon, and that the King clearly di&s;cern'd it was contrived by the Duke, and that he had likewi&s;e prevail'd with the Prince to be well plea&s;ed with it; his Maje&s;ty &s;ent for them, and, with much warmth and pa&s;&s;ion, di&s;&s;waded them from appearing Farther in it; and conjured them <Q>&startq;&endq;to u&s;e all their intere&s;t and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> authority to re&s;train it, as &s;uch a Wound to the Crown, that would not be ea&s;ily healed.</Q> And when he found the Duke unmov'd by all the con&s;iderations, and arguments, and commands, he had offer'd, he &s;aid, in greater choler, <Q>&startq;&endq;By God <HI>Stenny</HI> you are a Fool, and will &s;hortly repent this folly, and will find, that, in this Fit of popularity, you are making a Rod,</Q> with which you will be &s;courged your Self: And turn|ing in &s;ome anger to the Prince, told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he would live to have his belly full of Parliament Impeachments: and, when I &s;hall be dead, you will have too much cau&s;e to remember, how much You have contributed to the Weak'ning of the Crown, by the Two Precedents, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> you are Now &s;o fond of;</Q> intending as well the Engaging the Parlia|ment in the War, as the Pro&s;ecution of the Earl of <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Duke's power (&s;upported by the Prince's countenance) was grown &s;o great in the two Hou&s;es, that it was in vain for the King to interpo&s;e; and &s;o (notwith&s;tanding &s;o good a Defence made by the Earl, that he was ab&s;olv'd from any notorious crime, by the impartial opi|nion of many of tho&s;e, who heard all the evidence) he was at la&s;t con|demn'd in a great Fine, to a long and &s;trict Impri&s;onment, and Never to &s;it in Parliament during his life: a clau&s;e of &s;uch a nature as was never before found in any Judgement of Parliament, and, intruth, not to be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> inflicted upon any Peer but by Attainder.</P>

<P>No man had &s;een the Blow, or the Man who gave it, but in the confu&s;ion, they were in, every man made his own conjecture, and de|clared it as a thing known; mo&s;t agreeing that it was done by the <HI>French,</HI> from the angry di&s;cour&s;e they thought they had heard from Them.

Being then ask'd (which was the di&s;covery principally aim'd at) by who&s;e In&s;tigation he had perform'd that horrid and wicked act; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> he an&s;wer'd them with a wonderful a&s;&s;urance, <Q>&startq;&endq;That they &s;hould not trouble them&s;elves in that Enquiry; that no man living had credit or power enough with him to have engaged, or di&s;po&s;ed him to &s;uch an

He confe&s;s'd that he had come to the Town but the night before, and had kept his lodg|ing, that he might not be &s;een, or taken notice of: and that he had come that morning to the Duke's lodging, where he had waited at the door for his coming out; and when he found, by the motions within, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> he was coming, he drew to the door, as if he held up the hanging; and S^r <HI>Thomas Fryar</HI> &s;peaking with the Duke, as hath been &s;aid, and being of a much lower &s;tature than the Duke, who a little inclined towards him,</Q> he took the opportunity of giving the Blow over His &s;houlders.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke very frankly of what he had done, and bore the reproaches of tho&s;e who &s;poke to him, with the temper of a man who thought he had not done ami&s;s. But after he had been in Pri&s;on &s;ome time, where he was treated without any rigour, and with humanity enough; and be|fore, and at his Trial, which was about four months after, at the Kings bench Bar, he behaved him&s;elf with great mode&s;ty and wonderful repen|tance; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> being, as he &s;aid, convinced in his con&s;cience, that he had done Wickedly, and ask'd the pardon of the King, and Duche&s;s, and of all the Duke's Servants, whom he acknowledg'd to have offended; and very earne&s;tly be&s;ought the Judges that he might have his hand &s;truck off, with which he had perform'd that impious act, before he &s;hould be put to death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's receiving the news of the Duke's death.</NOTE> THE Court was too near <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and too many Courtiers upon the place, to have this Murther (&s;o barbarous in the nature and circum|&s;tances, the like whereof had not been known in <HI>England</HI> many ages) long conceal'd from the King. His Maje&s;ty was at the publick Prayers <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of the Church, when S^r <HI>John Hippe&s;ly</HI> came into the room, with a troubled countenance, and without any pau&s;e, in re&s;pect of the Exerci&s;e they were performing, went directly to the King, and whi&s;per'd in his ear what had fall'n out. His Maje&s;ty continued unmov'd, and without the lea&s;t change in his countenance, till Prayers were ended; when he &s;uddainly departed to his chamber, and threw him&s;elf upon his bed, la|menting with much pa&s;&s;ion, and with abundance of tears, the Lo&s;s he had of an excellent Servant, and the horrid manner in which he had been deprived of him: and he continued in this melancholick di&s;compo&s;ure of mind many days.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> YET his manner of receiving the news in Publick, when it was fir&s;t brought him in the pre&s;ence of &s;o many (who knew of &s;aw nothing of the pa&s;&s;ion he expre&s;s'd upon his retreat) made many men believe, that the accident was not very ungrateful; at lea&s;t, that it was very indiffe|rent to him; as being rid of a Servant very ungracious to the People, and the prejudice to who&s;e Per&s;on exceedingly ob&s;tructed all overtures made in Parliament for his &s;ervice.</P>

&s;ure never any Prince expre&s;s'd a more lively regret for the Lo&s;s of a Servant, than his Maje&s;ty did for this great Man, in his con&s;tant favour and kindne&s;s to his Wife and Children; in all offices of grace towards his Servants; and in a wonderful &s;ollicitous care for the Payment of his Debts; which, it is very true, were Contracted for his Maje&s;tys &s;ervice; though in &s;uch a manner, that there remain'd no evidence of it, nor were any of the Duke's Officers intru&s;ted with the knowledge of it, nor any record kept of it, but in the King's own generous memory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Character of the Duke</NOTE> THIS great man was a Per&s;on of a Noble nature, and Generous di&s;|po&s;ition, and of &s;uch other Endowments, as made him very capable of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> being a great Favourite to a great King. He under&s;tood the Arts of a Court, and all the Learning that is profe&s;s'd There, exactly well. By long practi&s;e in bu&s;ine&s;s, under a Ma&s;ter that di&s;cour&s;ed excellently, and &s;urely knew all things wonderfully, and took much delight in Indoctrinating his young unexperienced Favourite, who, he knew, would be allways look'd upon as the Workman&s;hip of his Own hands, He had obtain'd a quick conception, and apprehen&s;ion of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had the habit of Speaking very gracefully, and pertinently. He was of a mo&s;t flowing Courte&s;y and Affability, to all men who made any addre&s;s to him; and &s;o de&s;irous to Oblige them, that he did not enough con&s;ider the Value of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the obligation, or the Merit of the per&s;on he cho&s;e to oblige; from which, much of his Misfortune re&s;ulted. He was of a Courage not to be daunted, which was manife&s;ted in all his Actions, and in his Conte&s;ts with particu|lar per&s;ons of the greate&s;t reputation; and e&s;pecially in his whole de|meanour at the I&s;le of <HI>Ree,</HI> both at the Landing, and upon the Retreat; in both which no man was more fearle&s;s, or more ready to expo&s;e him|&s;elf to the highe&s;t dangers. His Kindne&s;s, and Affection to his Friends was &s;o vehement, that they were as &s;o many marriages for better and wor&s;e, and &s;o many leagues offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive; as if he thought him|&s;elf obliged to love all his Friends, and to make war upon all They were <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> angry with, let the cau&s;e be what it would. And it cannot be denied, that he was an Enemy in the &s;ame exce&s;s; and pro&s;ecuted tho&s;e he look'd upon as his Enemies, with the utmo&s;t rigour and animo&s;ity; and was not ea&s;ily induced to reconciliation. And yet there were &s;ome examples of his receding in that particular. And when he was in the highe&s;t pa&s;|&s;ion, he was &s;o far from &s;tooping to any Di&s;&s;imulation, whereby his di&s;|plea&s;ure might be conceal'd and cover'd, till he had attain'd his revenge, (the low method of Courts) that he never endeavour'd to do any man an ill office, before he fir&s;t told him what he was to expect from him, and reproach'd him with the injuries he had done, with &s;o much genero&s;ity, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> that the per&s;on found it in his power to receive &s;urther &s;atisfaction, in the way he would choo&s;e for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN this manner he proceeded with the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> a man of great Name in that time, and whom he had endeavour'd by many civil offices to make his Friend, and who &s;eem'd equally to incline to the Friend&s;hip: when he di&s;cover'd (or as many thought but &s;u&s;pected) that the Earl was enter'd into &s;ome Cabal in Parliament again&s;t him; he could not be di&s;&s;waded by any of his Friends, to whom he imparted his re&s;olution, but meeting the Earl the next day, he took him a&s;ide, and after many reproaches for &s;uch and &s;uch ill offices, he had done him, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> for Breaking his Word towards him, he told him <Q>&startq;&endq;he would rely no longer on His Friend&s;hip, nor &s;hould He expect any further Friend&s;hip from him, but on the contrary, he would be for ever his Enemy, and

do him all the mi&s;chief he could.</Q> The Earl, (who, as many thought, had not been Faulty towards him, was as Great-hearted as He, and thought the very Su&s;pecting him to be an injury Unpardonable) with|out any reply to the particular, declared <Q>&startq;&endq;that he neither cared for his Friend&s;hip,</Q> nor fear'd his Hatred; and from thence avowedly entred into the conver&s;ation, and confidence of Tho&s;e, who were allways awake to Di&s;cover, and &s;ollicitous to Pur&s;ue any thing, that might prove to his Di&s;advantage; which was of Evil con&s;equence to the Duke; the Earl be|ing of the mo&s;t Ancient of the Nobility, and a man of great Courage, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and of a Family, which had in no time &s;werv'd from its Fidelity to the Crown.</P>
<P>S^r FRANCIS <HI>Cottington,</HI> who was Secretary to the Prince, and not grown Courtier enough to di&s;&s;emble his opinion, had given the Duke Of|fence, before his journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> as is before touch'd upon, and Im|proved that prejudice after his coming thither, by di&s;po&s;ing the Prince all he could to the Marriage of the Infanta; and by his behaviour after his return, in ju&s;tifying to King <HI>James,</HI> who had a very good opinion of him, the Sincerity of the <HI>Spantard</HI> in the Treaty of the Marriage, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they did intruth de&s;ire it, and were fully re&s;olv'd to gratify his Maje&s;ty <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and only de&s;ired in the Manner of it, to gratify the Emperour, and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> all they could, which would take up very little time.</Q> All which being &s;o Contrary to the Duke's purpo&s;es and re&s;olutions, his Di&s;plea&s;ure to <HI>Cottington</HI> was &s;ufficiently manife&s;t.

And when he was one morning Attend|ing in the Privy lodgings, as he accu&s;tom'd to do, one of the Secre|taries of State came to him, and told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was the King's Plea|&s;ure,</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> he &s;hould no more pre&s;ume to come into tho&s;e Rooms; (which was the fir&s;t in&s;tance, he had receiv'd of the King's Disfavour) and at the &s;ame in&s;tant the Duke entred into that Quarter: S^r <HI>Francis Cotting|ton</HI> addre&s;s'd him&s;elf towards him, and de&s;ired <Q>&startq;&endq;he would give him leave to &s;peak to him;</Q> upon which the Duke inclining his ear, moved to a window from the Company; and the other told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he receiv'd every day fre&s;h Marks of his Severity;</Q> mention'd the Me&s;&s;age, which had been then deliver'd to him, and de&s;ired only to know, <Q>&startq;&endq;Whether it could not be in his power, by all dutyful Application, and all po&s;&s;ible Service, to be re&s;tored to the good Opinion, his Grace had once vouch|&s;afed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to have of him,</Q> and to be admitted to Serve him? The Duke heard him, without the lea&s;t commotion, and with a countenance &s;e|rene enough, and then an&s;wer'd him, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he would deal very clear|ly with him, that it was utterly Impo&s;&s;ible to bring that to pa&s;s, which he had Propo&s;ed: That he was not only firmly re&s;olv'd Never to tru&s;t him, or to have to do with him, but that he was, and would be allways his declared Enemy: and that he would do allways, what&s;oever &s;hould be in his power to Ruin and De&s;troy him, and of this he might be mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured:</Q> without mentioning any particular ground for his &s;o heightned Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> THE Other very Calmly replied to him (as he was Ma&s;ter of an in|comparable Temper) <Q>&startq;&endq;That &s;ince he was re&s;olv'd Never to do him Good, he hoped from his Ju&s;tice, and Genero&s;ity, that he would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to Gain by his Lo&s;s; That he had laid out, by his command,

&s;o much money for Jewels, and Pictures, which he had receiv'd: and that, in hope of his future Favour, he had once pre&s;ented a Suit of Hangings to him, which co&s;t him 800', which he hoped he would cau&s;e to be re&s;tored to him, and that he would not let him be &s;o great a Loo&s;er by him. The Duke an&s;wer'd, "he was in the right; that he &s;hould the next morning go to <HI>Oliver</HI> (who was his Receiver) and give him a particular account of all the Money due to him, and he &s;hould pre&s;ently pay him;</Q> which was done the next morning accordingly, without the lea&s;t abatement of any of his demands.</P>

<P>HIS &s;ingle Misfortune was (which indeed was productive of many greater) that he never made a noble, and a worthy Friend&s;hip with a man &s;o near his equal, that he would frankly advi&s;e him for his Honour, and true Intere&s;t, again&s;t the current, or rather the torrent of his Impe|tuous Pa&s;&s;ions; which was partly the Vice of the Time, when the Court <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> was not repleni&s;h'd with great choice of Excellent Men; and partly the Vice of the Per&s;ons, who were mo&s;t worthy to be applied to, and look'd upon his Youth, and his Ob&s;curity before his Ri&s;e, as Obligations upon him to gain their Friend&s;hips by extraordinary Application. Then his A&s;cent was &s;o quick, that it &s;eem'd rather a Flight than a Growth, and he was &s;uch a Darling of Fortune, that he was at the Top, before he was well &s;een at the Bottom; and as if he had been Born a Favourite, he was Supreme the fir&s;t Month he came to Court; and it was want of confi|dence, not of credit, that he had not all at fir&s;t, which he obtain'd after|wards; never meeting with the lea&s;t Ob&s;truction from his Setting out, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> till he was as Great as he could be: So that he wanted Dependants be|fore he thought he could want Coadjutors. Nor was he very Fortunate in the election of tho&s;e Dependants, very few of his Servants having been ever qualified enough to A&s;&s;i&s;t or Advi&s;e him; and they were intent only upon growing Rich under him, not upon their Ma&s;ter's growing Good, as well as Great: In&s;omuch as he was throughout his Fortune a much Wi&s;er man, than any Servant of Friend he had.</P>
<P>LET the Fault or Misfortune be what, or whence it will, it may rea&s;onably be believ'd that if he had been ble&s;s'd with One Faithful Friend, who had been qualified with Wi&s;dom and Integrity, that great <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Per&s;on would have committed as few Faults, and done as tran&s;cendent worthy Actions, as any Man, who &s;hined in &s;uch a Sphere in that Age in <HI>Europe.</HI> For he was of an excellent Di&s;po&s;ition, and of a Mind very capable of Advice and Coun&s;el: He was in his Nature ju&s;t and candid, liberal, generous, and bountiful; nor was it ever known, that the temptation of Money &s;way'd him to do an unju&s;t, or unkind thing. And though he left a very great E&s;tate to his Heirs; con&s;idering the va&s;t For|tune he inherited by his Wife, the &s;ole Daughter, and Heir of <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> he owed no part of it to his Own Indu&s;try, or Sollici|tation; but to the Impatient Humour of two Kings his Ma&s;ters, who <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> would make his Fortune equal to his Titles, and the one as much above other men, as the other was. And he con&s;ider'd it no otherwi&s;e than as Theirs, and left it at his death engaged for the Crown, allmo&s;t to the value of it, as is touch'd upon before.</P>

IF he had an immoderate Ambition, with which he was charged, and is a Weed (if it be a Weed) apt to grow in the be&s;t Soils; it doth not ap|pear that it was in his Nature, or that he brought it with him to the Court, but rather found it there, and was a Garment nece&s;&s;ary for that Air.

<P>BY the&s;e Means, and by this Method, this great Affair, upon which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the Eyes of <HI>Christendom</HI> had been &s;o long fix'd, came to be Di&s;&s;olv'd, without the lea&s;t mixture with, or contribution from tho&s;e Amours, which were afterwards &s;o confidently di&s;cour&s;ed of. For though the Duke
<PB N="31" REF="580">
was naturally carried violently to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, when there was any grace or beauty in the Object, yet the Duche&s;s of <HI>Olivarez,</HI> of whom was the talk, was then a Woman &s;o old, pa&s;t Children, of &s;o abject a pre|&s;ence, in a word, &s;o crooked and deform'd, that &s;he could neither tempt his Appetite, nor magnify his Revenge. And what&s;oever he did after|wards in <HI>England</HI> was but <HI>tueri opus,</HI> and to Pro&s;ecute the De&s;ign he had, upon the Rea&s;on and Provocation afore&s;aid, &s;o long before contrived during his abode in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THE Other particular, by which he involv'd him&s;elf in &s;o many Fa|tal <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Intricacies, from which he could Never extricate him&s;elf, was, his running violently into the War with <HI>France,</HI> without any kind of Pro|vocation, and upon a Particular Pa&s;&s;ion very unwarrantable. In his Em|ba&s;&s;y in <HI>France,</HI> where his Per&s;on and Pre&s;ence was wonderfully ad|mired, and e&s;teem'd (and in truth it was a Wonder in the eyes of all men) and in which he appear'd with all the Lu&s;tre, the Wealth of <HI>England</HI> could adorn him with, and Out&s;hined all the bravery that Court could dre&s;s it &s;elf in, and Overacted the whole Nation in their own mo&s;t pe|culiar Vanities: He had the Ambition to fix his Eyes upon, and to de|dicate his mo&s;t violent Affection to a Lady of a very &s;ublime Quality, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and to pur&s;ue it with mo&s;t importunate Addre&s;&s;es; In&s;omuch as when the King had brought the Queen his Si&s;ter, as far as he meant to do, and deliver'd her into the hands of the Duke, to be by him conducted into <HI>England;</HI> the Duke, in his journey, after the departure from that Court, took a re&s;olution once more to make a Vi&s;it to that great Lady, which he believ'd he might do with much privacy. But it was &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;|cover'd, that Provi&s;ion was made for his Reception; and if he had pur|&s;ued his Attempt, he had been without doubt A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; of which he had only &s;o much notice, as &s;erv'd him to decline the Danger. But he Swore, in the in&s;tant, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would See, and Speak with that Lady, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in Spight of the Strength and Power of <HI>France.</HI></Q> And from the time that the Queen arrived in <HI>England,</HI> he took all the ways he could to Un|dervalue and Exa&s;perate that Court and Nation, by cau&s;ing all Tho&s;e, who fled into <HI>England</HI> from the ju&s;tice and di&s;plea&s;ure of that King, to be receiv'd and entertain'd here, not only with ceremony and &s;ecurity, but with bounty and magnificence; and the more extraordinary the Per&s;ons were, and the more notorious their King's di&s;plea&s;ure was to|wards them (as in that time there were very many Lords, and Ladys in tho&s;e circum&s;tances) the more re&s;pectfully they were receiv'd, and e&s;teem'd. He omitted no opportunity to Incen&s;e the King again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and to di&s;po&s;e him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Hugonots, whom he likewi&s;e encouraged to give their King &s;ome trouble.</P>
<P>AND which was Wor&s;e than all this, he took great pains to Le&s;&s;en the King's Affection towards his young Queen, being exceedingly jealous, le&s;t Her Intere&s;t might be of force enough to Cro&s;s his other De&s;igns: And in this Stratagem, he &s;o far &s;werv'd from the In&s;tinct of his Nature, and his proper Inclinations, that He who was compounded of all the ele|ments of Affability, and Courte&s;y towards all kind of People, had brought him&s;elf to a habit of Neglect, and even of Rudene&s;s towards the Queen.</P>
<P>ONE day, when he unju&s;tly apprehended, that She had &s;hewed &s;ome <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> di&s;re&s;pect to his Mother, in not going to her Lodging at an hour &s;he had intended to go, and was hindred by a meer accident; he came into her Chamber in much Pa&s;&s;ion, and, after &s;ome Expo&s;tulations rude enough, he told her, <HI>She &s;hould Repent it;</HI> her Maje&s;ty an&s;wering with &s;ome
<PB N="32" REF="590">
quickne&s;s, he replied In&s;olently to her, <HI>that there had been Queens in</HI> England, <HI>who had lo&s;t their Heads.</HI> And it was univer&s;ally known, that, during His life, the Queen never had any Credit with the King, with reference to any Publick Affairs, and &s;o could not Divert the Re&s;o|lution of making a War with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE War with <HI>Spain</HI> had found the Nation in a Surfeit of a long Peace, and in a di&s;po&s;ition Inclinable enough to war with That nation, which might put an end to an Alliance the mo&s;t ungrateful to them, and which they mo&s;t fear'd, and from whence no other Damage had yet be|fall'n them, than a Chargeable and Un&s;ucce&s;ful Voyage by Sea, without <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the lo&s;s of Ships or Men. But a War with <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t be carried on at another rate, and expence. Be&s;ides, the Nation was weary and &s;urfeited with the Fir&s;t, before the Second was entred upon; and it was very vi&s;i|ble to Wi&s;e men, that when the general Trade of the Kingdom, from whence the Support of the Crown principally re&s;ulted, &s;hould be utterly extingui&s;h'd with <HI>France,</HI> as it was with <HI>Spain,</HI> and interrupted or ob|&s;tructed with all other Places (as it mu&s;t be in a great mea&s;ure, in a War, how Pro&s;perou&s;ly &s;oever carried on) the Effects would be very Sad, and Involve the King in many Perplexities; and it could not but fall out accordingly. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>UPON the return from <HI>Cales</HI> without &s;ucce&s;s, though all the Ships, and, upon the matter, all the Men were &s;een (for though &s;ome had &s;o &s;urfeited in the Vineyards, and with the Wines, that they had been left behind, the Genero&s;ity of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ent them all home again) and though by that Fleet's putting in at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> near two hundred miles from <HI>London,</HI> there could be but very Imperfect relations, and the news of Ye&s;terday was contradicted by the Morrow; be&s;ides that the Expe|dition had been undertaken by the Advice of the Parliament, and with an univer&s;al Approbation of the People, &s;o that nobody could rea&s;onably &s;peak loudly again&s;t it; Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, the Ill Succe&s;s was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> heavily born, and imputed to Ill Conduct, the principal Officers of the Fleet and Army divided among&s;t them&s;elves, and All united in their murmurs again&s;t the General, the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Wimbledon;</HI> who, though an old Officer in <HI>Holland,</HI> was never thought equal to the En|terpri&s;e. In a word, there was Indi&s;po&s;ition enough quickly di&s;cover'd again&s;t the War it &s;elf, that it was ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd, it would not be pur|&s;ued with the vigour, it was entred into, nor carried on by any cheerful contribution of money from the Publick.</P>
<P>BUT the running into this War with <HI>France</HI> (from whence the Queen was &s;o newly, and joyfully receiv'd) without any colour of Rea&s;on, or <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;o much as the formality of a Declaration from the King, containing the ground, and provocation, and end of it, according to cu&s;tom and obliga|tion in the like ca&s;es (for it was ob&s;erv'd, that the Manife&s;to which was publi&s;h'd was in the Duke's own Name, who went Admiral and General of the Expedition) opened the mouthes of all men, to Inveigh again&s;t it with all Bitterne&s;s: and the &s;uddain Ill Effects of it; manife&s;ted in the Return of the Fleet to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> within Such a di&s;tance of <HI>London,</HI> that nothing could be Conceal'd of the Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd; in which, Mo&s;t no|ble Families found a Son, or a Brother, or near Kin&s;man wanting, with|out &s;uch Circum&s;tances of their deaths, as are u&s;ually the Con&s;ola|tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and Recompen&s;es of &s;uch Cata&s;trophes. The Retreat had been a Rout without an Enemy, and the <HI>French</HI> had Their revenge by the Di&s;|order, and Confu&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Them&s;elves; in which, great num|bers
<PB N="33" REF="600">
of Noble and Ignoble were crowded to death, or drowned without the help of an Enemy: and as &s;ome thou&s;ands of the Common men were wanting, &s;o few of tho&s;e Principal officers, who attain'd to a Name in War, and by who&s;e Courage and Experience any war was to be con|ducted, could be found.</P>
<P>THE effects of this overthrow did not at fir&s;t appear in whi&s;pers, murmurs, and invectives, as the retreat from <HI>Cales</HI> had done; but pro|duced &s;uch a general Con&s;ternation over the face of the whole Nation, as if all the armys of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> were united together, and had <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> cover'd the land. Mutinies in the Fleet and Army, under pretence of their want of Pay (whereof no doubt there was much due to them) but in truth, out of dete&s;tation of the Service, and the Authority of the Duke. The Counties throughout the Kingdom were &s;o incen&s;ed, and their affections poi&s;on'd, that they refu&s;ed to &s;uffer the Soldiers to be billetted upon them; by which, they often underwent greater incon|veniencies and mi&s;chiefs, than they endeavour'd to prevent. The en|deavour to rai&s;e new men for the recruit of the Army, by Pre&s;&s;ing (the u&s;ual method, that had commonly been practi&s;ed upon &s;uch occa&s;ions) found oppo&s;ition in many places; and the Authority by which it was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> done not &s;ubmitted to, as being counted illegal. This produced a re&s;ort to Martial Law, by which many were executed; which rai&s;ed an a&s;pe|rity in the minds of more than of the common people. And this di&s;tem|per was &s;o univer&s;al, that the lea&s;t &s;park &s;till meeting with combu&s;tible matter enough to make a flame; all wi&s;e men look'd upon it as the Pre|diction of the De&s;truction, and Di&s;&s;olution, that would follow. Nor was there a Serenity in the Countenance of any man, who had age and expe|rience enough to con&s;ider things to come; but only in tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd the de&s;truction of the Duke; and thought it could not be purcha&s;ed at too dear a price; and look'd upon this flux of humours as an inevitable <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> way to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>AND it cannot be denied, that from the&s;e two Wars &s;o wretchedly entred into, and the circum&s;tances before mention'd, and which flowed from thence, the Duke's ruin took its date; and never left pur&s;uing him, till that execrable act upon his per&s;on: the malice whereof was contracted by that &s;ole evil Spirit of the time, without any partner in the Con&s;pi|racy. And the Venome of That &s;ea&s;on increa&s;ed and got vigour; un|till, from one Licence to another, it proceeded till the Nation was cor|rupted to that mon&s;trous degree, that it grew Satiated, and weary of the Government it &s;elf; under which it had enjoy'd a greater mea&s;ure of Fe|licity, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> than any Nation was ever po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of; and which could never be continued to them, but under the &s;ame Government. And as the&s;e cala|mities Originally &s;prung from the Inordinate appetite and pa&s;&s;ion of this young man, under the too much Ea&s;ine&s;s of two indulgent Ma&s;ters, and the concurrence of a thou&s;and other accidents; So, if he had liv'd longer, the ob&s;ervation and experience he had gain'd, which had very much im|proved his Under&s;tanding, with the Greatne&s;s of his &s;pirit, and Jealou&s;y of his Ma&s;ter's honour (to whom his Fidelity was Superior to any tem|ptation) might have repair'd many of the Inconveniencies, which he had introduced, and would have prevented the Mi&s;chiefs which were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the natural effects of tho&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of a Prediction of the Duke's death.</NOTE> THERE were many Stories &s;catter'd abroad at that time, of &s;everal Prophecies, and Predictions of the Duke's untimely and violent death. Among&s;t the re&s;t there was one, which was upon a better foundation of
<PB N="34" REF="610">
credit, than u&s;ually &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es are founded upon. There was an Officer in the King's Wardrobe in <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, of a good reputation for hone&s;ty and di&s;cretion, and then about the age of fifty years or more: this man had, in his youth, been bred in a School, in the Pari&s;h where S^$ <HI>George Villiers</HI> the father of the Duke liv'd; and had been much che|ri&s;h'd and obliged, in that &s;ea&s;on of his age, by the &s;aid S^r <HI>George,</HI> whom afterwards he never &s;aw. About &s;ix months before the mi&s;erable end of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> about midnight, this man, being in his bed, at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> where his Office was, and in a very good health, there appear'd to him on the &s;ide of his bed, a man of a very venerable a&s;pect, who drew <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the curtains of his bed, and, fixing his eyes upon him, ask'd him, If he knew him. The poor man, half dead with fear, and apprehen&s;ion, be|ing ask'd the &s;econd time, Whether he remember'd him? and having in that time call'd to his memory the pre&s;ence of S^r <HI>George Villiers,</HI> and the very cloaths he u&s;ed to wear, in which at that time he &s;eem'd to be ha|bited, he an&s;wer'd him, That he thought him to be that per&s;on. He re|plyed, <Q>&startq;&endq;he was in the right; that he was the &s;ame, and that he expected a &s;ervice from him; which was, that he &s;hould go from Him to his &s;on the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and tell him, if he did not &s;omewhat to in|gratiate him&s;elf to the People, or, at lea&s;t, to abate the extream malice <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> they had again&s;t him,</Q> he would be &s;uffer'd to live but a &s;hort time. After this di&s;cour&s;e he di&s;appear'd; and the poor man, if he had been at all waking, &s;lept very well till morning, when he believ'd all this to be a dream, and con&s;ider'd it no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE next night, or &s;hortly after, the &s;ame Per&s;on appear'd to him again in the &s;ame place, and about the &s;ame time of the night, with an a&s;pect a little more &s;evere than before; and ask'd him, Whether he had done, as he had required him? and perceiving he had not, gave him very &s;evere reprehen&s;ions; told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;he expected more compliance from him; and that if he did not perform his commands, he &s;hould <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> enjoy no peace of mind,</Q> but &s;hould be allways pur&s;ued by him: upon which, he promi&s;ed him to obey him. But the next morning waking out of a good &s;leep, though he was exceedingly perplex'd with the lively re|pre&s;entation of all particulars to his memory, he was willing &s;till to per|&s;wade him&s;elf, that he had only dream'd: and con&s;ider'd, that he was a per&s;on at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Duke, that he knew not how to find any admi&s;&s;ion to his pre&s;ence; much le&s;s had any hope to be believ'd in what he &s;hould &s;ay. So with great trouble and unquietne&s;s, he &s;pent &s;ome time in thinking what he &s;hould do; and in the end re&s;olv'd to do no|thing in the matter. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Per&s;on appear'd to him the third time with a terrible coun|tenance, and bitterly reproaching him for not performing what he had promi&s;ed to do. The poor man had by this time recover'd the courage to tell him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that in truth he had deferr'd the execution of his commands, upon con&s;idering, how difficult a thing it would be for him to get any acce&s;s to the Duke, having acquaintance with no per&s;on about him; and if he could obtain admi&s;&s;ion to him, he &s;hould never be able to per&s;wade him, that he was &s;ent in Such a manner; but he &s;hould, at be&s;t, be thought to be mad, or to be &s;et on and employ'd, by his own or the malice of other men, to abu&s;e the Duke; and &s;o he &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;ure to be undone. The Per&s;on replyed, as he had done before, "that he &s;hould never find re&s;t, till he &s;hould perform what He required; and therefore he were better to di&s;patch it: that the acce&s;s to his Son
<PB N="35" REF="620">
was known to be very ea&s;y; and that few men waited long for him; and for the gaining him credit, he would tell him two or three parti|culars, which he charged him never to mention to any per&s;on living, but to the Duke him&s;elf; and He &s;hould no &s;ooner hear them, but he would believe all the re&s;t he &s;hould &s;ay:</Q> and &s;o repeating his threats he left him.</P>
<P>IN the morning, the poor man, more confirm'd by the la&s;t Appearance, made his journey to <HI>London;</HI> where the Court then was. He was very well known to S^r <HI>Ralph Freeman,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters of Reque&s;ts, who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> had married a Lady that was nearly allyed to the Duke, and was him|&s;elf well receiv'd by him. To him this man went; and though he did not acquaint him with all particulars, he &s;aid enough to him to let him &s;ee there was &s;omewhat extraordinary in it; and the knowledge he had of the &s;obriety, and di&s;cretion of the man, made the more impre&s;&s;ion in him. He de&s;ired, that, <Q>&startq;&endq;by His means he might be brought to the Duke; to &s;uch a place,</Q> and in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hould be thought fit: affirm|ing <Q>&startq;&endq;that he had much &s;o &s;ay to him; and of &s;uch a Nature, as would require much privacy,</Q> and &s;ome time and patience in the hearing. S^r <HI>Ralph</HI> promi&s;ed <Q>&startq;&endq;he would &s;peak fir&s;t with the Duke of him, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> then he &s;hould under&s;tand his plea&s;ure:</Q> and accordingly, in the fir&s;t opportunity, he did inform him of the reputation and hone&s;ty of the man, and then what he de&s;ired, and of all he knew of the matter. The Duke, according to his u&s;ual openne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he was the next day early to hunt with the King; that his hor&s;es &s;hould attend him at <HI>Lambeth</HI>-Bridge, where he would land by five of the clock in the morning; and if the man attended him there at that hour, he would walk,</Q> and &s;peak with him, as long as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. S^r <HI>Ralph</HI> carried the man with him the next morning, and pre&s;ented him to the Duke at his landing; who receiv'd him courteou&s;ly; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> walk'd a&s;ide in conference near an hour, none but his own Servants be|ing at that hour in that place; and they and S^r <HI>Ralph</HI> at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they could not hear a word, though the Duke &s;ometimes &s;poke, and with great commotion; which S^r <HI>Ralph</HI> the more ea&s;ily ob&s;erv'd, and per|ceiv'd, becau&s;e he kept his eyes allways fix'd upon the Duke; having pro|cured the conference, upon &s;omewhat he knew there was of extraordi|nary. And the man told him in his return over the water, <Q>&startq;&endq;that when he mention'd tho&s;e particulars, which were to gain him credit, the Sub&s;tance whereof he &s;aid he dur&s;t not impart to him, the Duke's co|lour changed, and he &s;wore he could come to that knowledge only by <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the Devil; for that tho&s;e particulars were known only to him&s;elf, and to one per&s;on more,</Q> who, he was &s;ure, would never &s;peak of it.</P>
<P>THE Duke pur&s;ued his purpo&s;e of hunting; but was ob&s;erv'd to ride all the morning with great pen&s;ivene&s;s, and in deep thoughts, without any delight in the exerci&s;e he was upon: and before the morning was &s;pent, left the field, and alighted at his Mother's lodgings in <HI>White-hall;</HI> with whom he was &s;hut up for the &s;pace of two or three hours; the noi&s;e of their di&s;cour&s;e frequently reaching the ears of tho&s;e, who attended in the next rooms: and when the Duke left her, his countenance appear'd full of trouble, with a mixture of anger; a countenance, that was never <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> before ob&s;erv'd in him, in any conver&s;ation with Her, towards whom he had a profound reverence. And the Counte&s;s her &s;elf (for though &s;he was married to a private Gentleman S^r <HI>Thomas Compton,</HI> &s;he had been created Counte&s;s of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> &s;hortly after her Son had fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="36" REF="630">
that Title) was, at the Duke's leaving her, found overwhelm'd in tears, and in the highe&s;t agony imaginable. Whatever there was of all this, it is a notorious truth, that when the news of the Duke's Murther (which happen'd within few months after) was brought to his Mother, &s;he &s;eem'd not in the lea&s;t degree &s;urpri&s;ed; but receiv'd it as if &s;he had fore|&s;een it; nor did afterwards expre&s;s &s;uch a degree of &s;orrow, as was ex|pected from &s;uch a Mother, for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a Son.</P>
<P>THIS Digre&s;&s;ion much longer than it was intended, may not be thought alltogether improper in this Di&s;cour&s;e. For as the mention of his Death was very pertinent, in the place, and upon the occa&s;ion, it hap|pen'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to be made; &s;o upon that occa&s;ion, it &s;eem'd the more rea&s;onable to Digre&s;s, upon the Nature, and Character, and Fortune of the Duke; as being the be&s;t mirroir to di&s;cern the temper, and Spirit of that Age; and the wonderful concurrence of many fatal accidents, to disfigure the Government of two excellent Kings; under whom their Kingdoms in general pro&s;per'd exceedingly; and enjoy'd a longer Peace, a greater Plenty, and in fuller Security, than had been in any former age.</P>

A rare a&s;cent! All which Offices he di&s;charged with great abilities, and &s;ingular reputation of Integrity. In the fir&s;t year after the death of King <HI>James,</HI> he was advanced to be Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> (the u&s;ual advancement from the office of Atturney General) upon the removal of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln:</HI> who, though a man of great wit, and good Schola&s;tick learning, was ge|nerally thought &s;o very unequal to the Place, that his Remove was the only recompence and &s;atisfaction, that could be made for his Promotion. And yet it was enough known, that the Di&s;grace proceeded only from <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the private di&s;plea&s;ure of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The Lord <HI>Coventry</HI> enjoy'd this place with an univer&s;al reputation (and &s;ure Ju&s;tice was ne|ver better admini&s;tred) for the &s;pace of about &s;ixteen years; even to his
<PB N="37" REF="640">
death, &s;ome months before he was &s;ixty years of age: which was another important circum&s;tance of his Felicity; that great Office being &s;o &s;lip|pery, that no man had died in it before, for near the &s;pace of forty years. Nor had his Succe&s;&s;ors, for &s;ome time after him, much better fortune. And he him&s;elf had u&s;e of all his &s;trength, and skill (as he was an excel|lent Wre&s;tler in this kind) to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from falling, in two Shocks: the one given him by the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Lord high Trea|&s;urer of <HI>England;</HI> the other by the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had the greate&s;t power over the affections of the King of any man of that time.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> HE was a man of wonderful Gravity, and Wi&s;dom; and under&s;tood not only the whole Science, and My&s;tery of the Law, at lea&s;t equally with any man, who had ever &s;ate in that place; but had a clear con|ception of the whole Policy of the Government both of Church and State, which, by the unskilfulne&s;s of &s;ome well meaning men, ju&s;tled each the other too much.</P>
<P>HE knew the temper, di&s;po&s;ition, and genius of the Kingdom mo&s;t exactly; &s;aw their Spirits grow every day more &s;turdy, inqui&s;itive, and impatient: and therefore naturally abhorred all Innovations, which, he fore&s;aw, would produce ruinous effects. Yet many, who &s;tood at a di|&s;tance, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> thought that he was not active, and &s;tout enough in oppo&s;ing tho&s;e Innovations. For though, by his place, he pre&s;ided in all Publick Councils, and was mo&s;t &s;harp-&s;ighted in the Con&s;equence of things; yet he was &s;eldom known to Speak in matters of State, which, he well knew, were, for the mo&s;t part, concluded, before they were brought to that Publick agitation: never, in forreign affairs; which the vigour of his Judgement could well have comprehended: nor indeed freely in any thing, but what immediately, and plainly concern'd the Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom; and in that, as much as he could, he procured References to the Judges. Though, in his Nature, he had not only a firm Gravity, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> but a Severity, and even &s;ome Moro&s;ity; yet it was &s;o happily temper'd, and his Courte&s;y, and Affability towards all men &s;o tran&s;cendent, and &s;o much without affectation, that it marvellou&s;ly recommended him to all men of all degrees, and he was look'd upon as an excellent Courtier, with|out receding from the native &s;implicity of his own manners.</P>
<P>HE had, in the plain way of &s;peaking and delivery, without much ornament of Elocution, a &s;trange power of making him&s;elf believ'd, the only ju&s;tifiable de&s;ign of Eloquence: &s;o that though he u&s;ed very frank|ly to Deny, and would never &s;uffer any man to depart from him, with an opinion that he was inclined to Gratify, when in truth he was not; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> holding that Di&s;&s;imulation to be the wor&s;t of Lying: yet the Manner of it was &s;o gentle, and obliging, and his Conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;uch, to Inform the per&s;ons whom he could not Satisfy, that few departed from him with ill will, and ill wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>BUT then, this happy Temper, and the&s;e good Faculties, rather pre|&s;erv'd him from having many Enemies, and &s;upplied him with &s;ome Well-wi&s;hers, than furni&s;h'd him with any fa&s;t and un&s;haken Friends: who are allways procured in Courts, by more Ardour, and more vehe|ment Profe&s;&s;ions, and Applications, than He would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be entangled with. So that he was a man, rather exceedingly Liked, than <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> pa&s;&s;ionately Loved: in&s;omuch that it never appear'd, that he had any one Friend in the Court, of Quality enough to prevent, or divert any di&s;|advantage, he might be expo&s;ed to. And therefore it is no wonder, nor to be imputed to Him, that he retired within him&s;elf as much as he could;
<PB N="38" REF="650">
and &s;tood upon his Defence, without making de&s;perate &s;allies again&s;t growing mi&s;chiefs; which, he knew well, he had no power to hinder, and which might probably begin in his own Ruin. To conclude; his Se|curity con&s;i&s;ted very much in his having but little credit with the King; and he Died, in a &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t opportune, in which a wi&s;e man would have pray'd to have fini&s;h'd his cour&s;e, and which in truth crown'd his other &s;ignal pro&s;perity in the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>We&s;ton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI></NOTE> SIR <HI>Richard We&s;ton</HI> had been advanced to the White-&s;taff, into the office of Lord high Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome months before the death of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and had, in that &s;hort time, &s;o much di&s;|obliged <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> him, at lea&s;t di&s;appointed his expectation, that many, who were privy to the Duke's mo&s;t &s;ecret purpo&s;es, did believe, that if he had out|liv'd that voyage in which he was engaged, he would have remov'd him, and made another Trea&s;urer. And it is very true, that great Office too had been very &s;lippery, and not fa&s;t to tho&s;e, who had tru&s;ted them&s;elves in it: In&s;omuch as there were at that time, five Noble per&s;ons alive, who had all Succeeded one another immediately in that un&s;teady Charge, without any other per&s;on intervening: the Earl of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Mandevile,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mid|dle&s;ex;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who was removed under pretence <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of his age, and di&s;ability for the work (which had been a better rea&s;on again&s;t his Promotion, &s;o few years before, that his infirmities were very little increa&s;ed) to make room for the pre&s;ent Officer; who, though Ad|vanced by the Duke, may properly be &s;aid to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd by his Death.</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of a very ancient extraction by Father and Mo|ther. His Education had been very good among&s;t books and men. Af|ter &s;ome years &s;tudy of the Law in the Middle Temple, he travel'd into Forreign parts, and at an age fit to make Ob&s;ervations, and Reflections; out of which, that, which is commonly call'd Experience, is con&s;tituted. After this he betook him&s;elf to the Court, and liv'd there &s;ome years; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> at that di&s;tance, and with that awe, as was agreeable to the Mode&s;ty of the age, when men were Seen &s;ome time, before they were Known; and well known before they were Preferred, or dur&s;t pretend to it.</P>
<P>HE &s;pent the be&s;t part of his Fortune (a fair one, that he inherited from his Father) in his attendance at Court; and involv'd his Friends in Securities with him, who were willing to run his hopeful fortune, be|fore he receiv'd the lea&s;t Fruit from it, but the Countenance of great men, and tho&s;e in authority, the mo&s;t natural, and mo&s;t certain Stairs to a&s;cend by.</P>
<P>HE was then &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour to the Arch-Dukes, <HI>Albert</HI> and <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> into <HI>Flanders;</HI> and to the Dyet in <HI>Germany,</HI> to treat about the re&s;titution of the <HI>Palatinate;</HI> in which Negotiation he behaved him|&s;elf with great Prudence, and with the concurrent te&s;timony of his be|ing a Wi&s;e man, from all tho&s;e Princes and Emba&s;&s;adours, with whom he treated.</P>
<P>UPON his return he was made a Privy Coun&s;ellor, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the place of the Lord <HI>Brooke,</HI> who was either per|&s;waded, or put out of the place; which, being an office of Honour and Tru&s;t, is likewi&s;e an excellent Stage for men of parts to tread, and expo&s;e them&s;elves upon; where they have occa&s;ions of all kinds to lay out, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;pread all their Faculties and Qualifications, mo&s;t for their advantage. He behaved him&s;elf very well in this Function, and appear'd Equal to it; and carried him&s;elf &s;o luckily in Parliament, that he did his Ma&s;ter much
<PB N="39" REF="660">
Service, and pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf in the good opinion, and acceptation of the Hou&s;e; which is a ble&s;&s;ing not indulged to many by tho&s;e High Powers. He did &s;wim in tho&s;e troubled and boi&s;terous waters, in which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> rode as Admiral, with a good grace; when very many who were about him, were drowned, or forced on &s;hore with &s;hrewd hurts, and brui&s;es: which &s;hewed, he knew well How and When to u&s;e his limbs, and &s;trength to the be&s;t advantage; &s;ometimes only to avoid &s;inking; and &s;ometimes to Advance and get ground: and by this dexterity, he kept his credit with tho&s;e who could do him good, and lo&s;t <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> it not with others, who de&s;ired the de&s;truction of tho&s;e upon whom he mo&s;t depended.</P>
<P>HE was made Lord Trea&s;urer in the manner, and at the time men|tion'd before, upon the removal of the Earl of <HI>Malborough,</HI> and few months before the death of the Duke. The former circum&s;tance, which is often attended by Compa&s;&s;ion towards the Degraded, and Prejudice to|wards the Promoted, brought him no di&s;advantage: For be&s;ides the de|light that Sea&s;on had in Changes, there was little reverence towards the Per&s;on removed; and the extream vi&s;ible Poverty of the Exchequer &s;hel|ter'd that Province from the Envy, it had frequently created; and open'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> a door, for much Applau&s;e to be the portion of a wi&s;e, and provident Mini&s;ter. For the other, of the Duke's death, though &s;ome, who knew the Duke's pa&s;&s;ions, and prejudice (which often produced rather &s;uddain indi&s;po&s;ition, than ob&s;tinate re&s;olution) believ'd he would have been &s;hortly ca&s;hier'd, as &s;o many had lately been; and &s;o that the death of his Founder was a greater Confirmation of him in the Office, than the delivery of the White-&s;taff to him had been: yet many other wi&s;e men, who knew the Trea&s;urer's talent in removing prejudice, and reconciling him&s;elf to wavering and doubtful affections, believ'd, that the Lo&s;s of the Duke was very Un&s;ea&s;onable; and that the aw, or apprehen&s;ion of His <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> power, and di&s;plea&s;ure, was a very nece&s;&s;ary alloy for the Impetuo&s;ity of the new Officer's nature, which needed &s;ome re&s;traint, and check, for &s;ome time, to his immoderate Pretences, and appetite of Power.</P>
<P>HE did indeed appear on the &s;uddain wonderfully Elated, and &s;o far threw off his old affectation to plea&s;e Some very much, and to di&s;plea&s;e None, in which art he had excell'd; that in few months after the Duke's death, he found him&s;elf to &s;ucceed him in the publick di&s;plea&s;ure, and in the malice of his Enemies, without &s;ucceeding him in his credit at Court, or in the affection of any con&s;iderable Dependents. And yet, though he was not &s;uperiour to all other men in the affection, or rather <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> re&s;ignation of the King, &s;o that he might di&s;pen&s;e favours, and disfavours according to his own election; he had a full &s;hare in his Ma&s;ter's e&s;teem, who look'd upon him as a wi&s;e, and able Servant, and worthy of the tru&s;t he repo&s;ed in him; and receiv'd no other advice in the large bu&s;i|ne&s;s of his Revenue: nor was any man &s;o much his &s;uperiour, as to be able to le&s;&s;en him in the King's affection by his power. So that he was in a Po&s;t, in which he might have found much ea&s;e, and delight, if he could have contain'd him&s;elf within the verge of his own Province, which was large enough, and of &s;uch Extent, that he might, at the &s;ame time, have drawn a great dependance upon him of very con&s;iderable men, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and have appear'd a very u&s;eful, and profitable Mini&s;ter to the King; who&s;e Revenue had been very loo&s;ely managed during the late years, and might, by indu&s;try, and order, have been ea&s;ily improved: and no man better under&s;tood what method was nece&s;&s;ary towards that good husban|dry, than he.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="670">
BUT I know not by what frowardne&s;s in his Stars, he took more pains in examining, and inquiring into Other Mens offices, than in the di&s;|charge of his Own; and not &s;o much joy in what he Had, as trouble, and agony for what he had Not. The truth is, he had &s;o vehement a de&s;ire to be the &s;ole Favourite, that he had no reli&s;h of the power, he had: and in that contention he had many Rivals, who had credit enough to do him Ill offices, though not enough to &s;atisfy their own Ambition; the King him&s;elf being re&s;olv'd to hold the Reins in his own hands, and to put no further tru&s;t in others, than was nece&s;&s;ary for the Capacity they &s;erv'd in. Which Re&s;olution in his Maje&s;ty was no &s;ooner believ'd, and the Trea|&s;urer's <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Pretence taken notice of, than he found the number of his Ene|mies exceedingly increa&s;ed, and others to be le&s;s eager in the pur&s;uit of his Friend&s;hip; and every day di&s;cover'd &s;ome Infirmities in him, which being before known to few, and not taken notice of, did now expo&s;e him both to publick Reproach, and to private Animo&s;ities: and even his Vices admitted tho&s;e contradictions in them, that he could hardly enjoy the plea&s;ant fruit of any of them. That which fir&s;t expo&s;ed him to the publick jealou&s;y, which is allways attended with publick reproach, was the concurrent &s;u&s;picion of his Religion. His Wife, and all his Daughters were declared of the Roman Religion: and though He him&s;elf, and his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Sons, &s;ometimes went to Church, he was never thought to have Zeal for it; and his Dome&s;tick conver&s;ation and dependents, with whom only he u&s;ed entire freedom, were all known Papi&s;ts&punc; and were believ'd to be Agents for the re&s;t. And yet with all this di&s;advantage to him&s;elf, he ne|ver had reputation, and credit with that Party; who were the only peo|ple of the Kingdom, who did not believe him to be of their Profe&s;&s;ion. For the Penal Laws (tho&s;e only excepted which were Sanguinary, and even tho&s;e &s;ometimes let loo&s;e) were never more rigidly executed, nor had the Crown ever &s;o great a Revenue from them, as in his time; nor did they ever pay &s;o dear for the favours, and indulgencies of his office <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> towards them.</P>
<P>No man had greater ambition to make his Family great, or &s;tronger de&s;igns to leave a great Fortune to it. Yet his Expences were &s;o prodi|gious, e&s;pecially in his Hou&s;e, that all the ways he u&s;ed for &s;upply, which were all, that occurr'd, could not &s;erve his turn; in&s;omuch that he contracted &s;o great Debts (the anxiety whereof, he pretended, broke his mind, and re&s;train'd that attention, and indu&s;try, which was nece&s;&s;a|ry for the due execution of his Office) that the King was plea&s;ed Twice to pay his Debts; at lea&s;t towards it, to disbur&s;e forty thou&s;and pounds in ready money out of his Exchequer. Be&s;ides, his Maje&s;ty gave him <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> a whole Forre&s;t [<HI>Chute</HI> Forre&s;t in <HI>Hamp&s;hire]</HI> and much other land be|longing to the Crown; which was the more taken notice of, and Mur|mur'd again&s;t, becau&s;e, being the chief Mini&s;ter of the Revenue, he was particularly obliged, as much as in him lay, to prevent, and even oppo&s;e &s;uch Disinheri&s;on; and becau&s;e, under that obligation, he had avowedly, and &s;owrly cro&s;s'd the pretences of other men, and re&s;train'd the King's Bounty from being exerci&s;ed allmo&s;t to any. And he had that advan|tage (if he had made the right u&s;e of it) that his Credit was ample enough (&s;econded by the King's own experience, and ob&s;ervation, and inclina|tion) to Retrench very much of the late unlimited Expences, and e&s;pe|cially <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> tho&s;e of Bounties; which from the death of the Duke ran in nar|rower channels, and never &s;o much overflow'd as towards him&s;elf, who &s;topp'd the current to other men.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="680">
HE was of an imperious nature, and nothing wary in di&s;obliging and provoking other men, and had too much courage in offending and in|cen&s;ing them: but after having offended and incen&s;ed them, he was of &s;o unhappy a feminine temper, that he was allways in a terrible fright and apprehen&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>HE had not that application, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and reverence for the Queen, as might have been expected from his wi&s;dom and breeding; and often cro&s;s'd her pretences and de&s;ires, with more rudene&s;s than was natural to him. Yet he was impertinently &s;ollicitous to know what her <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Maje&s;ty &s;aid of him in private, and what Re&s;entments &s;he had towards him. And when by &s;ome Confidents who had their ends upon him from tho&s;e offices, he was inform'd of &s;ome bitter expre&s;&s;ions fall'n from her Maje&s;ty, he was &s;o exceedingly afflicted, and tormented with the &s;en&s;e of it, that &s;ometimes by pa&s;&s;ionate complaints, and repre&s;entations to the King; &s;ometimes by more dutiful addre&s;&s;es, and expo&s;tulations with the Queen, in bewailing his misfortune; he frequently expo&s;ed him&s;elf, and left his condition wor&s;e than it was before; and the eclairci&s;ment commonly ended in the di&s;covery of the per&s;ons, from whom he had receiv'd his mo&s;t &s;ecret intelligence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> HE quickly lo&s;t the character of a bold, &s;tout, and magnanimous man, which he had been long reputed to be in wor&s;e times: and, in his mo&s;t pro&s;perous &s;ea&s;on, fell under the reproach of being a man of big looks, and of a mean, and abject &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THERE was a very ridiculous Story at that time in the mouths of many, which, being a known truth, may not be unfitly mention'd in this place, as a kind of illu&s;tration of the Humour, and Nature of the man. S^r <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was then Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, and had, inherent in his office, the indubitable right and di&s;po&s;ition of the Six-Clarks places; all which he had for many years, upon any vacancy, be&s;tow'd to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> &s;uch per&s;ons as he thought fit. One of tho&s;e Places was become void, and de&s;ign'd by the old man to his &s;on <HI>Robert Cae&s;ar,</HI> a Lawyer of a good name, and exceedingly beloved. The Lord Trea&s;urer (as he was vigilant in &s;uch ca&s;es) had notice of the Clark's expiration &s;o &s;oon, that he pro|cured the King to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, expre&s;ly for|bidding him to di&s;po&s;e of that Six-Clark's place, till his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be further made known to him. It was the fir&s;t Command of that kind, that had been heard of, and was felt by the old man very Sen|&s;ibly. He was indeed very old, and had outliv'd mo&s;t of his Friends; &s;o that his Age was an objection again&s;t him; many Per&s;ons of Quality be|ing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> dead, who had, for recompence of Services, procured the rever&s;ion of his Office. The Trea&s;urer found it no hard matter &s;o far to terrify him, that (for the King's &s;ervice as was pretended) he admitted for a Six-Clark a per&s;on recommended by him (M^r <HI>Fern</HI> a dependant upon him) who #aid &s;ix thou&s;and pound ready money; which, poor man! he liv'd to re|pent in a Jayl. This work being done at the charge of the poor old man, who had been a Privy-Coun&s;ellor from the entrance of King <HI>James,</HI> had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, and &s;erv'd in other Offices; the depriving him of his Right made a great noi&s;e: and the condition of his Son (his Father being not likely to live to have the di&s;po&s;al of another <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> office in his power) who, as was &s;aid before, was generally belov'd, and e&s;teem'd, was argument of great compa&s;&s;ion; and was lively, and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully repre&s;ented to the King him&s;elf; who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to promi&s;e, that, "if the old man chanced to die before any other of the

Nor could all the King's Bounties, nor his own large Acce&s;&s;ions, rai&s;e a Fortune to his Heir; but after &s;ix or eight years &s;pent in outward opulency, and inward murmur and trouble, that it was not greater; after va&s;t &s;umms of money and great wealth gotten, and rather con&s;umed than enjoy'd; without any &s;en&s;e or delight in &s;o great Pro&s;perity&punc; with the agony that it was no greater; He Died unla|mented by Any; bitterly mention'd by Mo&s;t who never pretended to love him; and &s;everely cen&s;ured, and complain'd of by Tho&s;e, who ex|pected <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> mo&s;t from him, and de&s;erv'd be&s;t of him; and left a numerous Fa|mily, which was in a &s;hort time worn out, and yet outliv'd the Fortune he left behind him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter ,</HI> Lord Privy Seal.</NOTE> THE next great Coun&s;ellor of State was the Lord Privy-Seal, who was likewi&s;e of a Noble extraction, and of a Family at that time very fortunate. His Grandfather had been Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and left by King <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth one of the Executors of his la&s;t Will. He was the younger Son of his Father, and brought up in the &s;tudy of the Law in the Middle Temple; and had pa&s;s'd, and, as it were, made a progre&s;s through all the eminent Degrees of the Law, and in the State. At the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> or thereabouts, he was Recorder of <HI>London;</HI> then the King's Serjeant at Law; afterwards Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench. Before the death of King <HI>James,</HI> by the Favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he was rai&s;ed to the Place of Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and within le&s;s than a year afterwards, by the withdrawing of that Favour, he was reduced to the allmo&s;t empty Title of Pre&s;ident of the Council; and, to allay the &s;en&s;e of the di&s;honour, created Vi&s;count <HI>Mandevile.</HI> He bore the Diminution very well, as he was a wi&s;e man, and of an excellent temper; and quickly recover'd &s;o much grace, that he was made Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> and Lord Privy-Seal, and enjoy'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that Office to his death; whil&s;t he &s;aw many Removes, and Degrada|tions, in all the other Offices of which he had been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P>HE was a man of great Indu&s;try, and Sagacity in Bu&s;ine&s;s, which he delighted in exceedingly; and pre&s;erv'd &s;o great a vigour of Mind, even to his death (when he was very near eighty years of age) that &s;ome, who had known him in his younger years, did believe him to have much quicker Parts in his age, than before. His Honours had grown &s;a&s;ter upon him than his Fortunes; which made him too &s;ollicitous to ad|vance the latter, by all the ways which offer'd them&s;elves; whereby he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ome inconvenience, and many reproaches, and be|came <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> le&s;s capable of &s;erving the Publick by his Coun&s;els, and Authority; which his known wi&s;dom, long experience, and confe&s;s'd gravity, and ability, would have enabled him to have done; mo&s;t men con&s;idering more the Per&s;on that &s;peaks, than the Things he &s;ays. And he was un|happily too much u&s;ed as a Check upon the Lord <HI>Coventry;</HI> and when that Lord perplex'd their coun&s;els, and de&s;igns, with inconvenient ob|jections in Law, the Authority of the Lord <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> who had trod the &s;ame paths, was &s;till call'd upon; and he did too frequently gratify their unju&s;tifiable de&s;igns, and pretences&punc; a guilt and mi&s;chief, all men, who are obnoxious, or who are thought to be &s;o, are liable to, and can hardly pre|&s;erve <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> them&s;elves from. But his Virtues &s;o far weigh'd down his Infirmi|ties, that he maintain'd a good general reputation, and credit with the whole Nation, and People; he being allways look'd upon, as full of In|tegrity, and Zeal to the Prote&s;tant Religion, as it was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law,
<PB N="44" REF="700" MS="Y">
and of unque&s;tionable Loyalty, Duty, and Fidelity to the King; which two Qualifications will ever gather popular Breath enough to fill the Sails, if the Ve&s;&s;el be competently provided with Balla&s;t. He Died in a lucky time, in the beginning of the Rebellion, when neither Religion, Loyalty, Law, nor Wi&s;dom could have provided for any man's Security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <HI>Arundel.</HI></NOTE> THE Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> was the next Officer of State, who, in his own Right, and Quality, preceded the re&s;t of the Council. He was general|ly thought to be a proud man, who liv'd allways within him&s;elf, and to him&s;elf, conver&s;ing little with any, who were in common conver&s;ation; &s;o that he &s;eem'd to live as it were in another Nation, his Hou&s;e being a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> place, to which all people re&s;orted who re&s;orted to no other place; Strangers, or &s;uch who affected to look like Strangers, and dre&s;s'd them|&s;elves accordingly. He re&s;orted &s;ometimes to the Court, becau&s;e There only was a greater man than him&s;elf; and went thither the &s;eldomer, be|cau&s;e there Was a greater man than him&s;elf. He liv'd towards all Fa|vourites, and great Officers, without any kind of conde&s;cen&s;ion, and ra|ther &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be ill treated by their power and authority (for he was often in Di&s;grace, and once or twice Pri&s;oner in the Tower) than to de&s;cend in making any application to them.</P>
<P>AND upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions he &s;pent a great interval of his time in <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;everal Journeys into forreign Parts, and, with his Wife and Family, had liv'd &s;ome years in <HI>Italy;</HI> the humour, and manners of which Na|tion he &s;eem'd mo&s;t to like, and approve, and affected to imitate. He had a good fortune by De&s;cent, and a much greater from his Wife, who was the &s;ole Daughter upon the matter (for neither of the two Si&s;ters left any I&s;&s;ue) of the great Hou&s;e of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> but his Expences were without any mea&s;ure, and allways exceeded very much his Revenue. He was willing to be thought a Scholar, and to under&s;tand the mo&s;t my|&s;terious parts of Antiquity, becau&s;e he made a wonderful and co&s;tly Pur|cha&s;e of excellent Statues, whil&s;t he was in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in <HI>Rome</HI> (&s;ome <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> whereof he could never obtain permi&s;&s;ion to remove from <HI>Rome,</HI> though he had paid for them) and had a rare Collection of the mo&s;t curious Me|dals. As to all parts of Learning he was allmo&s;t illiterate, and thought no other part of Hi&s;tory &s;o con&s;iderable, as what related to his own Fa|mily; in which, no doubt, there had been &s;ome very memorable Per|&s;ons. It cannot be denied that he had in his per&s;on, in his a&s;pect, and countenance, the appearance of a great man, which he pre&s;erv'd in his gate, and motion. He wore and affected a Habit very different from that of the time, &s;uch as men had only beheld in the Pictures of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Men; all which drew the eyes of mo&s;t, and the reverence of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> many towards him, as the Image, and Repre&s;entative of the Primitive Nobility, and Native Gravity of the Nobles, when they had been mo&s;t Venerable: but this was only his out-&s;ide; his nature and true humour being much di&s;po&s;ed to levity, and delights, which indeed were very de|&s;picable and childi&s;h. He was rather thought not to be much concern'd for Religion, than to incline to this, or that Party of any: and had lit|tle other affection for the Nation or the Kingdom, than as he had a great &s;hare in it, in which like the great Leviathan he might &s;port him&s;elf; from which he withdrew, as &s;oon as he di&s;cern'd the repo&s;e thereof was like to be di&s;turb'd, and died in <HI>Italy,</HI> under the &s;ame doubtful character <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of Religion, in which he liv'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem|broke.</HI></NOTE> <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was next, a man of another mould, and making, and of another &s;ame, and reputation with all men, being the
<PB N="45" REF="710">
mo&s;t univer&s;ally belov'd and e&s;teem'd of any man of that age: and, having a great Office in the Court, he made the Court it &s;elf better e&s;teem'd, and more reverenced in the Country. And as he had a great number of Friends of the be&s;t men, &s;o no man had ever the confidence to avow him&s;elf to be his Enemy. He was a man very well bred, and of excellent parts, and a graceful Speaker upon any &s;ubject, having a good proportion of Learning, and a ready Wit to apply it, and enlarge upon it: of a plea&s;ant and facetious humour, and a di&s;po&s;ition affable, generous, and magnificent. He was ma&s;ter of a great Fortune from his Ance&s;tours, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and had a great addition by his Wife, another Daughter, and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> which he enjoy'd during his life, &s;he outliving him: but all &s;erv'd not his Expence, which was only limited by his great mind, and occa&s;ions to u&s;e it nobly.</P>
<P>HE liv'd many years About the Court, before In it; and never By it: being rather regarded and e&s;teem'd by King <HI>James,</HI> than lov'd and fa|vour'd. After the foul Fall of the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> he was made Lord Chamberlain of the King's Hou&s;e, more for the Courts &s;ake, than his Own; and the Court appear'd with the more Lu&s;tre, becau&s;e He had the Government of that Province. As he &s;pent and liv'd upon his own For|tune, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;o he &s;tood upon his own Feet, without any other &s;upport than of his proper Virtue and Merit: and liv'd towards the Favourites with that decency, as would not &s;uffer them to cen&s;ure or reproach his Ma&s;ter's judgement, and election, but as with men of his own rank. He was ex|ceedingly beloved in the Court, becau&s;e he never de&s;ired to get that for Him&s;elf, which Others labour'd for, but was &s;till ready to promote the pretences of worthy men. And he was equally celebrated in the Coun|try, for having receiv'd no obligations from the Court which might cor|rupt, or &s;way his affections, and judgement: &s;o that all who were di&s;|plea&s;ed, and un&s;atisfied In the Court, or With the Court, were allways <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> inclined to put them&s;elves under his Banner, if he would have admitted them: and yet he did not &s;o reject them, as to make them choo&s;e ano|ther Shelter, but &s;o far &s;uffer'd them to depend on him, that he could re&s;train them from breaking out beyond private re&s;entments, and mur|murs.</P>
<P>HE was a great lover of his Country, and of the Religion, and Ju&s;tice, which he believ'd could only &s;upport it; and his Friend&s;hips were only with men of tho&s;e Principles. And as his Conver&s;ation was mo&s;t with men of the mo&s;t pregnant parts, and under&s;tanding, &s;o towards any &s;uch, who needed &s;upport, or encouragement, though unknown, if fairly re|commended <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to him, he was very liberal. Sure never man was planted in a Court, that was fitter for that Soil, or brought better qualities with him to purify that Air.</P>
<P>YET his memory mu&s;t not be Flatter'd, that his virtues, and good in|clinations may be Believ'd; he was not without &s;ome allay of Vice, and without being clouded with great Infirmities, which he had in too exor|bitant a proportion. He indulged to him&s;elf the Plea&s;ures of all kinds&punc; allmo&s;t in all exce&s;&s;es. To Women, whether out of his natural con&s;titu|tion, or for want of his dome&s;tick content, and delight (in which he was mo&s;t unhappy, for he paid much too dear for his Wife's Fortune, by <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> taking her Per&s;on into the bargain) he was immoderately given up. But therein he likewi&s;e retain'd &s;uch a power, and juri&s;diction over his very appetite, that he was not &s;o much tran&s;ported with beauty, and outward allurements, as with tho&s;e advantages of the mind, as manife&s;ted an extra|ordinary
<PB N="46" REF="720" MS="Y">
wit, and &s;pirit, and knowledge, and admini&s;tred great plea&s;ure in the conver&s;ation. To the&s;e he &s;acrificed Him&s;elf, his precious time, and much of his fortune. And &s;ome, who were neare&s;t his tru&s;t and friend&s;hip, were not without apprehen&s;ion, that his natural vivacity, and vigour of mind begun to le&s;&s;en, and decline by tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Indul|gences.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time of the death of King <HI>James,</HI> or pre&s;ently after, he was made Lord Steward of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;e; that the Staff of Cham|berlain might be put into the hands of his Brother, the Earl of <HI>Montgo|mery,</HI> upon a new contract of Friend&s;hip with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> after who&s;e death, he had likewi&s;e &s;uch Offices of his, as he mo&s;t affected, of honour and command; none of profit, which he cared not for: and within two years after, he died him&s;elf of an Apoplexy, after a full and chearful Supper.</P>
<P>A SHORT Story may not be unfitly in&s;erted, it being very frequent|ly mention'd by a Per&s;on of known integrity, who&s;e Character is here undertaken to be &s;et down, and who, at that time, being on his way to <HI>London,</HI> met at <HI>Maidenhead</HI> &s;ome Per&s;ons of Quality, of relation or de|pendence upon the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> (S^r <HI>Charles Morgan,</HI> commonly call'd General <HI>Morgan,</HI> who had commanded an Army in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> defended <HI>Stoad;</HI> D^$ <HI>Feild,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of Saint <HI>Davids;</HI> and D^r <HI>Chafin,</HI> the Earl's then Chaplain in his hou&s;e, and much in his favour.) At Sup|per one of them drank a health to the Lord Steward: upon which ano|ther of them &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he believ'd his Lord was at that time very Mer|ry, for he had now outliv'd the day, which his Tutor <HI>Sandford</HI> had progno&s;ticated upon his Nativity he would not outlive; but he had done it now, for that was his Birth-day, which had compleated his age to fifty years.</Q> The next morning, by the time they came to <HI>Colebrook,</HI> they met with the news of his Death.</P>
<P>HE Died exceedingly lamented by men of all qualities, and left many <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of his Servants and Dependents owners of good E&s;tates, rai&s;ed out of his employments, and bounty. Nor had his Heir cau&s;e to complain. For though his Expences had been very magnificent (and it may be the le&s;s con&s;ider'd, and his providence the le&s;s, becau&s;e he had no Child to in|herit) in&s;omuch as he left a great Debt charged upon the E&s;tate; yet con&s;idering the wealth he left in Jewels, Plate, and Furniture, and the E&s;tate his Brother enjoy'd in the right of His Wife (who was not fit to manage it her &s;elf) during her long life, he may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have in|herited as good an E&s;tate from him, as He had from his Father, which was one of the be&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>

The former being a young man, &s;carce of age at the entrance of King <HI>James,</HI> had the good fortune by the comeline&s;s of his per&s;on, his skill, and indefatigable indu&s;try in Hunting, to be the fir&s;t, who drew the King's eyes towards him with affection; which was quickly &s;o far improved, that he had the reputation of a Favourite. Before the end of the fir&s;t, or &s;econd year, he was made Gentleman of the King's Bed-cham|ber, and Earl of <HI>Montgomery;</HI> which did the King no harm: For be|&s;ides <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> that he receiv'd the King's Bounty with more moderation than other men, who &s;ucceeded him; He was generally known, and as gene|rally e&s;teem'd; being the Son of one Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and younger Bro|ther

<P>HE pretended to no other qualifications, than to under&s;tand Hor&s;es and Dogs very well, which his Ma&s;ter loved him the better for (being, at his fir&s;t coming into <HI>England,</HI> very jealous of tho&s;e who had the repu|tation of great Parts) and to be believ'd hone&s;t and generous, which made him many Friends, and left him then no Enemy. He had not &s;ate many years in that Sun-&s;hine, when a new Comet appear'd in Court, <HI>Robert Carr,</HI> a <HI>Scots</HI>-man, quickly after declared Favourite; upon whom <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the King no &s;ooner fix'd his eyes, but the Earl, without the lea&s;t mur|mur, or indi&s;po&s;ition, left all doors open for his entrance: (A rare tem|per! and it could proceed from nothing, but his great perfection in loving Field-&s;ports) which the King receiv'd as &s;o great an Obligation, that he allways after loved him in the Second place, and commended him to his Son at his death, as a man to be relied on in point of Hone&s;ty and Fidelity; though it appear'd afterwards, that he was not &s;trongly Built, nor had &s;ufficient Balla&s;t to endure a Storm; of which more will be &s;aid hereafter.</P>

The Vices he had, were of the Age, which he was not &s;tubborn enough to contemn, or re&s;i&s;t. He was a Younger brother, Grandchild to the great Trea&s;urer <HI>Buckhur&s;t,</HI> created, at the King's fir&s;t Entrance, Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> who outliv'd his Father, and took care, and delight in the Edu|cation of his Grandchild, and left him a good Support for a Younger brother; be&s;ides a Wife, who was Heir to a fair Fortune. As his Per&s;on and Parts were &s;uch as are before mention'd, &s;o he gave them full &s;cope, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> without re&s;traint; and indulged to his appetite all the Plea&s;ures, that &s;ea|&s;on of his life (the fulle&s;t of jollity, and riot of any, that preceded, or &s;ucceeded) could tempt, or &s;ugge&s;t to him.</P>
<P>HE entred into a fatal Quarrel, upon a &s;ubject very unwarrantable, with a young Nobleman of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Bruce;</HI> upon which they both tran&s;ported them&s;elves into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and attended only by two Chirurgions placed at a di&s;tance, and under an obligation not to &s;tir, but upon the fall of one of them, they Fought under the Walls of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Bruce</HI> fell dead upon the place; and S^r <HI>Edward Sack|ville</HI> (for &s;o he was then call'd) being likewi&s;e hurt, retired into the next <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Mona&s;tery, which was at hand. Nor did this mi&s;erable accident, which he allways exceedingly lamented, make that through impre&s;&s;ion upon him, but that he indulged &s;till too much to tho&s;e importunate, and in&s;a|tiate appetites, even of that individual Per&s;on, that had &s;o lately em|bark'd him in that de&s;perate enterprize; being too much Tinder not to be inflamed with tho&s;e Sparks.</P>
<P>HIS Elder brother did not enjoy his Grandfather's Titles many years, before they de&s;cended, for want of Heirs male, to the Younger brother.

<P>THE former, a Younger brother of a noble Family in <HI>Scotland,</HI> came into the Kingdom with King <HI>James,</HI> as a Gentleman; under no other <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> character, than a per&s;on well qualified by his breeding in <HI>France,</HI> and by &s;tudy in humane Learning; in which he bore a good part in the enter|tainment of the King, who much delighted in that exerci&s;e: and by the&s;e means, and notable gracefulne&s;s in his behaviour, and affability, in which he excell'd, he had wrought him&s;elf into a particular intere&s;t with his Ma&s;ter, and into greater affection and e&s;teem with the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, than any other of that Country; by choo&s;ing Their friend&s;hips, and conver&s;ation, and really preferring it to any of his Own: In&s;omuch as upon the King's making him Gentleman of his Bedchamber, and Vi&s;count <HI>Donca&s;ter,</HI> by his Royal mediation (in which office he was a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> mo&s;t prevalent Prince) he obtain'd the &s;ole Daughter and Heir of the Lord <HI>Denny</HI> to be given him in marriage; by which he had a fair For|tune in Land provided for any I&s;&s;ue he &s;hould rai&s;e, and which his Son by that Lady liv'd long to enjoy.</P>
<P>HE a&s;cended afterwards, and with the expedition he de&s;ired, to the other Conveniencies of the Court. He was Groom of the Stole, and an Earl, and Knight of the Garter; and married a beautiful young Lady, Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> without any other approba|tion of her Father, or concernment in it, than &s;uffering Him and Her to come into his pre&s;ence after they were married. He liv'd rather in a fair <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Intelligence than any Friend&s;hip with the Favourites; having credit enough with his Ma&s;ter to provide for his own intere&s;t, and he troubled not him&s;elf for that of other men; and had no other con&s;ideration of money, than for the &s;upport of his lu&s;tre; and whil&s;t he could do that, he cared not for money, having no bowels in the point of running in debt, or borrowing all he could.</P>
<P>HE was &s;urely a man of the greate&s;t expence in his own per&s;on, of any in the age he liv'd; and introduced more of that expence in the exce&s;s of Cloaths and Diet, than any other man; and was indeed the Original of all tho&s;e inventions, from which others did but tran&s;cribe Copies. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> He had a great univer&s;al under&s;tanding, and could have taken as much delight in any other way, if he had thought any other as plea&s;ant, and worth his care. But he found Bu&s;ine&s;s was attended with more Rivals,
<PB N="49" REF="750">
and vexations; and, he thought, with much le&s;s plea&s;ure, and not more innocence.</P>
<P>HE left behind him the reputation of a very fine Gentleman, and a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Courtier; and after having &s;pent, in a very jovial life, above four hundred thou&s;and pounds, which, upon a &s;trict compu|tation, he receiv'd from the Crown, he left not a Hou&s;e, nor Acre of Land to be remember'd by. And when he had in his pro&s;pect (for he was very &s;harp-&s;ighted, and &s;aw as far before him as mo&s;t men) the gathering together of that Cloud in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which &s;hortly after cover'd both <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Kingdoms, he Died with as much tranquillity of mind to all appearance, as u&s;ed to attend a man of more &s;evere exerci&s;e of Virtue; and with as little apprehen&s;ion of death, which he expected many days.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was a younger Son of a Noble Hou&s;e, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of $word$</NOTE> very fruitful Bed, which divided a numerous I&s;&s;ue between two great Fathers: the Elde&s;t, many Sons and Daughters to the Lord <HI>Rich;</HI> the Younger, of both Sexes, to <HI>Mountjoy</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI> The reputa|tion of his Family gave him no great advantage in the world, though his elde&s;t Brother was Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and owner of a great Fortune; and his Younger Earl of <HI>Newport,</HI> of a very plentiful Revenue likewi&s;e. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> He, after &s;ome time &s;pent in <HI>France,</HI> betook him&s;elf to the War in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> which he intended to have made his Profe&s;&s;ion; where after he had made two or three Campaigns, according to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Voluntiers, he came in the lei&s;ure of the Winter to vi&s;it his Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and the Court, that &s;hined then in the plenty and bounty of King <HI>James;</HI> and about the time of the infancy of the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham</HI>'s favours, to whom he grew in a &s;hort time very acceptable. But his Friend&s;hip was more entire to the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> who was more of his nature, and humour, and had a genero&s;ity more applicable at that time to his fortune and his ends. And it was thought by many <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> who &s;tood within view, that for &s;ome years he &s;upported him&s;elf upon the Familiarity, and Friend&s;hip of the other; which continued mutual|ly between them very many years, with little interruption to their death.</P>
<P>HE was a very hand&s;ome man, of a lovely, and winning pre&s;ence, and gentile conver&s;ation; by which he got &s;o ea&s;y an admi&s;&s;ion into the Court, and grace of King <HI>James,</HI> that he gave over the thought of fur|ther intending the life of a Soldier. He took all the ways he could to en|dear him&s;elf to the Duke, and to his confidence, and wi&s;ely declined the receiving any grace or favour, but as His donation; above all, avoided <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the &s;u&s;picion that the King had any kindne&s;s for him, upon any account but of the Duke, who&s;e Creature he de&s;ired to be e&s;teem'd, though the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI>'s Friend. And he pro&s;per$d &s;o well in that Pretence, that the King &s;carce made more ha&s;t to advance the Duke, than the Duke did to promote the other.</P>
<P>HE fir&s;t prefer'd him to a Wife, the Daughter and Heir of <HI>Cope,</HI> by whom he had a good Fortune; and among&s;t other things, the Mannor and Seat of <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> of which he was &s;hortly after made Baron. And he had quickly &s;o entire a confidence in him, that the Duke prevail'd with the King to put him about his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and to be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> a Gentleman of his Bedchamber, before the Duke him&s;elf had rea&s;on to promi&s;e him&s;elf any proportion of his Highne&s;s's grace, and protection. He was then made Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> Captain of the Guard, Knight of the Garter, and of the Privy-Council; &s;ent the fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="760">
to treat the marriage with the Queen, or rather privately to treat about the marriage before he was Emba&s;&s;adour. And when the Duke went to the I&s;le of <HI>Ree,</HI> he tru&s;ted the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> with the command of that Army with which He was to be recruited, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>IN this Confidence, and in this Po&s;ture he was left by the Duke when he was kill'd; and having the advantage of the Queens good opinion, and favour (which the Duke neither had, nor cared for) he made all po&s;&s;ible approaches towards the obtaining His tru&s;t, and &s;ucceeding him in His power; or rather that the Queen might have &s;olely that Power, and he only be Sub&s;ervient to her; and upon this account, he made a continual <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> War upon the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> the Trea&s;urer, and all others who were not gracious to the Queen, or de&s;ired not the increa&s;e of her Authority. And in this State, and under this Protection he receiv'd every day new Obligations from the King, and great Bounties,and continued to Flouri&s;h above any man in the Court, whil&s;t the Weather was fair: but the Storm did no &s;ooner ari&s;e, but he changed &s;o much, and declined &s;o fa&s;t from the Honour he was thought to be ma&s;ter of, that he fell into that Condition, which there will be hereafter too much cau&s;e to mention, and $o enlarge upon.</P>

<P>Of the&s;e two Secretaries the Former was a man of a very narrow education, and a narrower nature; having continued long in the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where he had gotten Latin learning enough; and afterwards in the Country in the condition of a private Gentleman, till a$ter he was fifty years of age; when, upon &s;ome reputation he had for Indu&s;try and Diligence, he was call'd to &s;ome painful employment in the office of the Navy, which he di&s;charged well; and afterwards to be Ma&s;t$r of Reque&s;ts, and then to be Secretary of State, which he enjoy'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to a great age: and was a man rather unadorn'd with any parts of vi|gour and quickne&s;s, and unindow'd with any notable virtues, than noto|riou$ for any weakne&s;s or defect of under&s;tanding, or tran&s;ported with any virious inclinations, appetite to Money only excepted.

He had been &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour to <HI>Venice,</HI> where he re&s;ided many years with good reputation; and was no &s;ooner return'd from thence in|to <HI>England,</HI> than he went Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>Holland</HI> to the States Ge|neral, and re&s;ided there when that Synod was a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Dort,</HI> which hath given the World &s;o much occa&s;ion &s;ince for uncharitable Di&s;puta|tions, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> which They were call'd together to prevent. Here the Emba&s;&s;a|dour was not thought &s;o equal a Spectator, or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as he ought to have been; but by the infu&s;ions he made into King <HI>James,</HI> and by his own activity, he did all he could to di&s;countenance that Party that was mo&s;t Learned, and to rai&s;e the credit and authority of the Other; which hath &s;ince proved as inconvenient, and trouble&s;ome to their own Coun|try, as to their Neighbours.</P>
<P>HE was once more Emba&s;&s;adour extraordinary in <HI>Holland</HI> after the death of King <HI>James,</HI> and was the la&s;t who was admitted to be Pre&s;ent, and to Vote in the General A&s;&s;embly of the States, under that Character; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of which great Priviledge the Crown had been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd from a great part of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and through the time of King <HI>James,</HI> to that moment; which admini&s;tred fre&s;h matter of Murmur for the giving up the Towns of the <HI>Brill,</HI> and <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> which had been done &s;ome years before by King <HI>James;</HI> without which men thought tho&s;e States would not have had the courage &s;o &s;oon to have degraded the Crown of <HI>England</HI> from a Place in their Councils, which had pro&s;per'd &s;o eminently under the Shadow of that Power, and Support.

THERE were more (too many more) Honourable Per&s;ons in that time of the Privy-Council, who&s;e Faculties were not notorious enough to give them any great part in the Affairs, nor had their Advice much Influence upon them.

And no que&s;tion, as the exorbitancy of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the next Parliament, proceeded principally from their contempt of the Laws, and that contempt from the &s;candal of that Judgement: &s;o the concurrence of the Hou&s;e of Peers in that fury, can be imputed to no one thing more, than to the irreverence and &s;corn the Judges were ju&s;tly in; who had been allways before look'd upon There as the Oracles <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of the Law, and the be&s;t Guides to a&s;&s;i&s;t that Hou&s;e in their opinions, and actions: And the Lords now thought them&s;elves excu&s;ed for &s;werving from the rules and cu&s;toms of their Predece&s;&s;ors (who in altering, and making of Laws, in judging of Things and Per&s;ons, had allways ob&s;erv'd the advice and judgement of tho&s;e Sages) in not asking que&s;tions of Tho&s;e, whom they knew nobody would believe; thinking it a ju&s;t re|proach upon them (who out of their Court&s;hip had &s;ubmitted the diffi|culties, and my&s;teries of the Law, to be mea&s;ured by the &s;tandard of what they call$d General Rea&s;on, and explain'd by the Wi&s;dom of State) that They them&s;elves &s;hould make u&s;e of the Licence, which the Others <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> had taught them, and determine that to be Law, which they thought to be rea&s;onable, or found to be convenient. If The&s;e men had pre&s;erv'd the &s;implicity of their Ance&s;tors, in &s;everely and &s;trictly defending the Laws, Other men had ob&s;erv'd the mode&s;ty of Theirs, in humbly and dutifully Obeying them.</P>
<P>UPON this Con&s;ideration it is very ob&s;ervable, that in the wi&s;dom of former times, when the Prerogative went highe&s;t (as very often it hath been &s;woln above any pitch we have &s;een it at in our times) never any Court of Law, very &s;eldom any Judge, or Lawyer of reputation, was call'd upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in an Act of Power; the Crown well knowing the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> moment of keeping Tho&s;e the objects of reverence, and veneration with the People: and that though it might &s;ometimes make &s;allies upon them by the Prerogative, yet the Law would keep the People from any inva|&s;ion of it, and that the King could never &s;uffer, whil&s;t the Law, and the Judges were look'd upon by the Subject, as the <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> for their Li|berties, and Security. And therefore yon &s;hall find the Policy of many Princes hath endured as &s;harp animadver&s;ions, and reprehen&s;ions from the Judges of the Law, as their Piety hath from the Bi&s;hops of the Church; as having no le&s;s influence upon the People, under the reputa|tion of Ju&s;tice, by the one, than under the tyes of Con&s;cience and Reli|gion, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> by the other.</P>
<P>TO extend this Con&s;ideration of the form, and circum&s;tance of pro|ceeding in Ca&s;es of an unu&s;ual nature a little farther; As it may be mo&s;t behoveful for Princes in matters of grace, and honour, and in conferring
<PB N="56" REF="820">
of favours upon their People, to tran&s;act the &s;ame as Publickly as may be, and by Them&s;elves, or their Mini&s;ters to dilate upon it, and improve the lu&s;tre by any addition, or eloquence of Speech (where, it may be, every kind word, e&s;pecially from the Prince him&s;elf, is look'd upon as a new bounty); So it is as requi&s;ite in matters of judgement, puni&s;h|ment, and cen&s;ure upon Things, or Per&s;ons (e&s;pecially when the Ca&s;e, in the nature of it, is unu&s;ual, and the rules in Judging as extraordinary) that the &s;ame be tran&s;acted as Privately, and with as little noi&s;e, and pomp of words, as may be. For (as Damage is much ea&s;ier born, and &s;ubmitted to by generous minds, than Di&s;grace) in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ship|money, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and many other Ca&s;es in the Star-chamber, and at Council-Board, there were many impertinencies, incongruities, and in&s;olencies, in the Speeches, and Orations of the Judges, much mor$ offen&s;ive, and much more &s;candalous than the Judgements, and Sentences them&s;elves. Be&s;ides that mens minds and under&s;tandings were more in&s;tructed to di&s;cern the con&s;equence of things, which before they con&s;ider'd not. And undoubtedly my Lord <HI>Finch</HI>'s Speech in the Exchequer-Chamber made Ship-money much more abhor'd, and formidable, than all the Commitments by the Council-Table, and all the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es taken by the Sherifs in <HI>England:</HI> the major part of men (be&s;ides the common uncon|cernedne&s;s <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in other mens &s;ufferings) looking upon tho&s;e Proceedings with a kind of applau&s;e to them&s;elves, to &s;ee other men Puni&s;h'd, for not doing as they had done; which delight was quickly determin'd, when they found their own intere&s;t, by the unnece&s;&s;ary Logick of that Argu|ment, no le&s;s concluded than M^r <HI>Hambdens.</HI></P>

<P>THESE Errors (for Errors they were in View, and Errors they are proved by the Succe&s;s) are not to be imputed to the Court, but to the Spirit, and Over-activity of the Lawyers them&s;elves; who &s;hould more carefully have pre&s;erv'd their Profe&s;&s;ion, and its Profe&s;&s;ors, from being profaned by tho&s;e Services, which have rendred both &s;o obnoxious to reproach.

In order to this Journey, which was made with great Splendour, and proportionable Expence, he added to the Train of his Court many of the greate&s;t Nobi|lity, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> who increa&s;ed the Pomp of the Court at their own charge (for &s;o they were required to do) and &s;eem'd with alacrity to &s;ubmit to the King's plea&s;ure, as &s;oon as they knew his de&s;ire; and &s;o his Attendance in all re&s;pects was proportionable to the Glory of the greate&s;t King.</P>
<P>THIS whole Progre&s;s was made from the fir&s;t &s;etting out, to the end of it, with the greate&s;t Magnificence imaginable; and the highe&s;t exce&s;s of Fea&s;ting was then introduced, or, at lea&s;t, Fea&s;ting was then carried to a height, it never had attain'd before, from whence it hardly declined afterwards, to the great damage and mi&s;chief of the Nation in their E&s;tates, and Manners. All Per&s;ons of Quality and Condition, who liv'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> within di&s;tance of the Northern Road, receiv'd the great per&s;ons of the Nobility with that Ho&s;pitality, which became them; in which all co&s;t was employ'd to make their Entertainments &s;plendid, and their Hou&s;es capable of tho&s;e entertainments. The King him&s;elf met with many en|tertainments of that nature, at the charge of particular Men, who de|&s;ired the honour of his Pre&s;ence, which had been rarely practi&s;ed till then by the Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Condition, though it hath &s;ince grown in|to a very inconvenient cu&s;tom.

<P>THE King was very well plea&s;ed with his Reception, and with all the Tran&s;actions there; nor indeed was there any thing to be blamed, but the luxury, and va&s;t expence, which abounded in all re&s;pects of Fea&s;ting, and Cloaths with too much licence: which being imputed to the commendable zeal of the People, of all conditions, to &s;ee their King among&s;t them, whom they were not like to &s;ee there again, and &s;o their <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> expence was to be but once made, no man had cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect any mi&s;|chief from it: and yet the Debts contracted at that time by the Nobility, and Gentry, and the Wants and Temptations they found them&s;elves ex|po&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet the S$$$s of the $word$ Commo|t$$$s then &s;$$n.</NOTE> to, from that unlimited Expence, did very much contribute to the kindling that Fire, which &s;hortly after broke out in &s;o terrible a combu|&s;tion: nor were the &s;parks of Murmur and Sedition then &s;o well co|ver'd, but that many di&s;cerning men di&s;cover'd very pernicious De&s;igns to lurk in Their brea&s;ts, who &s;eem'd to have the mo&s;t chearful Counte|nances, and who acted great parts in the Pomp, and Triumph. And it evidently appear'd, that They of that Nation, who Shined mo&s;t in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Court of <HI>England,</HI> had the lea&s;t Influence in their own Country, except only the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who&s;e affection to his Ma&s;ter was even then &s;u&s;pected by the wi&s;e&s;t Men in both Kingdoms; and that the im|men&s;e Bounties the King, and his Father had &s;catter'd among&s;t Tho&s;e of that Nation, out of the Wealth of <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides that he had &s;acrificed the whole Revenue of that Kingdom to Them&s;elves, were not look'd upon as any benefit to that Nation, but as obligations ca&s;t away upon particular Men; many of whom had with it wa&s;ted their own Patri|mony in their Country.</P>

<P>THE King was allways the mo&s;t punctual ob&s;erver of all Decency in his Devotion, and the &s;tricte&s;t promoter of the Ceremonies of the Church, as believing in his Soul the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be in&s;tituted the neare&s;t to the Practice of the Apo&s;tles, and the be&s;t for the propagation and ad|vancement of Chri&s;tian Religion, of any Church in the world: and on the other &s;ide, though no man was more aver&s;e from the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church than He was, nor better under&s;tood the motives of their Separation from us, and Animo&s;ity again&s;t us, he had the highe&s;t di&s;like, and prejudice to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that part of his own Subjects, who were again&s;t the Government e&s;ta|li&s;h'd, and did allways look upon them as a very dangerous, and &s;edi|tious People; who would under pretence of Con&s;cience, which kept them from &s;ubmitting to the Spiritual Juri&s;diction, take the fir&s;t opportunity, they could find, or make, to withdraw them&s;elves from their Temporal Subjection; and therefore he had, with the utmo&s;t vigilance, cau&s;ed that Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition to be watch'd and provided again&s;t in <HI>England;</HI> and if it were then in truth there, it lurk'd with wonderful &s;ecrecy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;actions about intro|ducing a Li|turgy into <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> THE King his Son, who with his Father's other Virtues, inherited that Zeal for Religion, propo&s;ed nothing more to him&s;elf, than to Unite his three Kingdoms in one Form of God's Wor&s;hip, and publick Devo|tions; and there being now &s;o great a Serenity in all his Dominions as is mention'd before, there is great rea&s;on to believe, that in this journey into <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Crown'd, he carried with him the re&s;olution to Fini&s;h that important bu&s;ine&s;s in the Church at the &s;ame time. To that end, the then Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> D^r <HI>Laud,</HI> attended on his Maje&s;ty throughout that whole Journey, which, as he was Dean of the Chappel, he was not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> obliged to do, and no doubt would have been excu&s;ed from, if that De|&s;ign had not been in view; to accompli&s;h which he was no le&s;s &s;ollicitous than the King him&s;elf, nor the King the le&s;s &s;ollicitous for his advice. He Preach'd in the Royal Chappel at <HI>Edenborough</HI> (which &s;carce any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man had ever done before in the King's pre&s;ence) and principally upon the benefit of Conformity, and the reverend Ceremonies of the Church, with all the marks of approbation and applau&s;e imaginable; the great civility of that People being &s;o notorious, and univer&s;al, that they would not appear unconformable to his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;h in any par|ticular. And many Wi&s;e men were then, and &s;till are of opinion, that, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> if the King had Then propo&s;ed the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to have been receiv'd and practi&s;ed by that Nation, it would have been &s;ub|mitted to without oppo&s;ition: but, upon mature con&s;ideration, the King concluded that it was not a good Sea&s;on to promote that Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>HE had Pa&s;s'd two or three Acts of Parliament, which had much le&s;&s;en'd the Authority and Dependence of the Nobility, and great Men, and incen&s;ed, and di&s;po&s;ed them proportionably to cro&s;s, and oppo&s;e any Propo&s;ition, which would be mo&s;t grateful; and that overthwart hu|mour was enough di&s;cover'd to rule in the brea&s;ts of many, who made the greate&s;t profe&s;&s;ions. Yet this was not the Ob&s;truction, which diverted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the King: the Party that was aver&s;e from the thing, and abhor'd any thought of Conformity, could not have been powerful enough to have &s;top'd the progre&s;s of it; the mi&s;chief was, that They, who mo&s;t de&s;ired it, and were mo&s;t concern'd to promote it, were the men, who u&s;ed all their credit to divert the Pre&s;ent attempting it; and the Bi&s;hops them|&s;elves, who&s;e Intere&s;t was to be mo&s;t advanced thereby, applied all their coun&s;els &s;ecretly to have the matter more Maturely con&s;ider'd; and the whole De&s;ign was never con&s;ulted but Privately, and only &s;ome few of the great Men of that Nation, and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops advi&s;ed with by the King, and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> it being manife&s;t enough, that <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> as the Fini&s;hing that great Affair mu&s;t be very grateful to <HI>England,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t not appear to have a hand in the Contriving, and Pro|moting it.</P>

THE &s;ame Men, who did not only pretend, but really and heartily wi&s;h, that they might have a Liturgy to order, and regulate the Wor&s;hip of God in their Churches, and did very well approve the Ceremonies e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;ired to &s;ubmit to, and practice the &s;ame there, had no mind that the Very Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be propo&s;ed to, or accepted by them; for which they of|fer'd two prudential Rea&s;ons, as their Ob&s;ervations upon the nature, and humour of the Nation, and upon the Conferences, they had often had with the Be&s;t men upon that Subject, which was often agitated in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> di&s;cour&s;e, upon what had been formerly projected by King <HI>James,</HI> and upon what frequently occur'd to Wi&s;e men in Di&s;cour&s;es upon the thing it &s;elf, and the de&s;irablene&s;s of it.</P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t was, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, how piou&s;ly and wi&s;ely &s;o|ever framed, and in&s;tituted, had found great Oppo&s;ition: and though the matter of the Ceremonies had wrought for the mo&s;t part only upon Light-headed, Weak men, who&s;e &s;atisfaction was not to be labour'd for; yet there were many Grave, and Learned men, who excepted again&s;t &s;ome Particulars, which would not be &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd; <Q>&startq;&endq;That the reading P&s;alms being of the old Tran&s;lation were in many particulars <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;o different from the new, and better Tran&s;lation, that many in&s;tances might be given of importance to the Sen&s;e,</Q> and Truth of Scripture.

<P>THE other Rea&s;on, which no doubt was the principal, and took this in the way to give it the better introduction, was, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Kingdom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of <HI>Scotland</HI> generally had been long Jealous, that by the King's con|tinued ab&s;ence from them, they &s;hould by degrees be reduced to be but as a Province to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ubject to their Laws, and Government, which they would never &s;ubmit to; nor would any man of Honour, who lov'd the King be&s;t, and re&s;pected <HI>England</HI> mo&s;t, ever con&s;ent to bring that Di&s;honour upon his Country. If the very Liturgy, in the terms it is con&s;tituted, and practi&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be offer'd to them, it would kindle, and inflame that Jealou&s;y, as the Prologue, and Introduction to that De&s;ign, and as the fir&s;t Range of that Ladder, which &s;hould &s;erve to mount over all their Cu&s;toms, and Priviledges, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and be oppo&s;ed, and dete&s;ted accordingly: whereas if his Maje&s;ty would give order for the preparing a Liturgy, with tho&s;e few de&s;irable Al|terations, it would ea&s;ily be done; and in the mean time They would &s;o di&s;po&s;e the minds of the People for the reception of it, that they &s;hould even de&s;ire it.</Q> This Expedient was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, and vehe|mently urged even by the Bi&s;hops, that however they defer'd to the minds, and humours of other men, it was manife&s;t enough, that the Ex|ception, and Advice proceeded from the pride of their own hearts.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> who was allways pre&s;ent with the King at the&s;e Debates, was exceedingly troubled at this Delay, and to find tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> men the In&s;truments in it, who &s;eem'd to him as Sollicitous for the ex|pedition, as Zealous for the thing it &s;elf, and who could not but Suffer by the deferring it. He knew well how far any Enemies to Conformity would be from being &s;atisfied with tho&s;e &s;mall Alterations, which being
<PB N="66" REF="920">
con&s;ented to, they would with more confidence, though le&s;s rea&s;on, frame other Exceptions, and in&s;i&s;t upon them with more ob&s;tinacy. He fore&s;aw the Difficulties which would ari&s;e in rejecting, or altering, or adding to the Liturgy, which had &s;o great Authority, and had, by the practice of near four&s;core years, obtain'd great Veneration from all &s;ober Prote&s;tants; and how much ea&s;ier it would be to make Objections again&s;t any thing that &s;hould be New, than again&s;t the Old; and would there|fore have been very glad that the former Re&s;olution might be pur&s;ued; there having never been any thoughts in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> or the pre&s;ent King, but of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy; be&s;ides that any Variation <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> from it, in how &s;mall matters &s;oever, would make the Uniformity the le&s;s, the Manife&s;tation whereof was that, which was mo&s;t aim'd at, and de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THE King had exceedingly &s;et his heart upon the matter, and was as much &s;candalized as any man at the Di&s;order, and Indecency in the exerci&s;e of Religion in that Church: yet he was affected with what was offer'd for a little Delay in the execution, and knew more of the ill hu|mour, and practices among&s;t the Greate&s;t Men of the Kingdom at that &s;ea&s;on, than the Bi&s;hop did, and believ'd he could better compo&s;e, and reduce them in a little time, and at a di&s;tance, than at the pre&s;ent, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> whil&s;t he was among&s;t them. Be&s;ides he was in his nature much inclined to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation, having been born among&s;t them, and as Jealous, as any one of Them could be, of their Liberties and Priviledges, and as Careful they might not be Invaded by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who, he knew, had no great reverence for them: and therefore the Objection, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it would look like an Impo&s;ition from <HI>England,</HI> if a Form, &s;ettled in Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> &s;hould without any Alteration be tender'd (though by Him&s;elf) to be &s;ubmitted to,</Q> and ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion in his Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>HE was a man of great Parts, and very exemplary Virtues, allay'd and di&s;credited by &s;ome unpopular natural Infirmities; the greate&s;t of which was (be&s;ides a ha&s;ty, &s;harp way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf) that he believ'd Innocence of heart, and Integrity of manners, was a guard &s;trong enough to &s;ecure any man in his voyage through this world, in what Company &s;oever he travell'd, and through what Ways &s;oever he was to pa&s;s: and &s;ure never any man was better &s;upplied with that Provi&s;ion.

<PB N="70" REF="960">
Proctor&s;hip, and the Doctor&s;hip) could be obtain'd there. He was all|ways maligned, and per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e who were of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Faction, which was then very powerful, and who, according to their u&s;ual maxim and practice, call every man they do not love, Papi&s;t; and, under this &s;en&s;ele&s;s appellation, they created him many troubles and vexations; and &s;o far &s;uppre&s;s'd him, that though he was the King's Chaplain, and taken notice of for an excellent Preacher, and a Scholar of the mo&s;t &s;ublime Parts, he had not any Preferment to invite him to leave his poor College, which only gave him bread, till the vigour of his age was pa&s;t; and when he was promoted by King <HI>James,</HI> it was but to a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> poor Bi&s;hoprick in <HI>Wales,</HI> which was not &s;o good a Support for a Bi&s;hop, as his College was for a private Scholar, though a Doctor.</P>
<P>PARLIAMENTS in that time were frequent, and grew very bu&s;y, and the party, under which he had &s;uffer'd a continual Per&s;ecution, ap|pear'd very powerful, and full of de&s;ign, and They, who had the courage to Oppo&s;e them, begun to be taken notice of with approbation and countenance: under this Style he came to be fir&s;t cheri&s;h'd by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had made &s;ome experiments of the temper and &s;pirit of the Other people, nothing to his &s;atisfaction. From this time he pro&s;per'd at the rate of his own wi&s;hes, and being tran&s;planted out of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> his cold barren Dioce&s;s of <HI>Saint Davids,</HI> into a warmer Climate, he was left, as was &s;aid before, by that great Favourite in that great Tru&s;t with the King; who was &s;ufficiently indi&s;po&s;ed towards the Per&s;ons, or the Principles of <HI>Calvin's</HI> Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>WHEN he came into great Authority, it may be, he retain'd too keen a memory of Tho&s;e, who had &s;o unju&s;tly, and uncharitably Per&s;ecuted him before; and, I doubt, was &s;o far tran&s;ported with the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions, he had rea&s;on to complain of in his Adver&s;aries, that, as they accu&s;ed Him of Popery, becau&s;e he had &s;ome doctrinal Opinions, which they liked not, though they were nothing ally'd to Popery; &s;o he entertain'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> too much prejudice to &s;ome Per&s;ons, as if They were Enemies to the Di&s;cipline of the Church, becau&s;e they concur'd with <HI>Calvin</HI> in &s;ome doctrinal Points; when they abhor'd his Di&s;cipline, and reverenced the Government of the Church, and pray'd for the Peace of it with as much zeal and fervency as any in the Kingdom; as they made manife&s;t in their Lives, and in their Sufferings with it, and for it. He had, from his fir&s;t entrance into the world, without any di&s;gui&s;e or di&s;&s;imulation, de|clared his own opinion of that Cla&s;&s;is of men, and, as &s;oon as it was in his power, he did all he could to hinder the growth, and increa&s;e of that Faction, and to re&s;train Tho&s;e, who were inclined to it, from doing the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> mi&s;chief they de&s;ired to do. But his Power at Court could not enough qualify him to go through with that difficult Reformation, whil&s;t he had a Superior in the Church, who, having the Reins in His hand, could Slacken them according to his own humour and indi&s;cretion; and was thought to be the more remi&s;s, to irritate his cholerick di&s;po&s;ition. But when he had now the Primacy in his own hand, the King being in&s;pired with the &s;ame Zeal, he thought he &s;hould be to blame, and have much to an&s;wer for, if he did not make ha&s;t to apply Remedies to tho&s;e Di&s;ea|&s;es, which he &s;aw would grow apace.</P>

They had been Fellows together in one College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and, when he was fir&s;t made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Saint Davids,</HI> he made him Pre&s;ident of that College: when he could no longer keep the Deanery of the Chappel-Royal, he made him his Succe&s;|&s;or in that near Attendance upon the King: and now he was rai&s;ed to be <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Arch-Bi&s;hop, he ea&s;ily prevail'd with the King to make the other, Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> before, or very &s;oon after he had been Con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> if he were more than Elect of that Church.</P>

The Church was not repined at, nor the lea&s;t inclination to alter the Govern|ment, and Di&s;cipline thereof, or to change the Doctrine. Nor was there at that time any con&s;iderable number of Per&s;ons of any valuable Condi|tion throughout the Kingdom, who did wi&s;h either; and the cau&s;e of &s;o prodigious a Change in &s;o few years after was too vi&s;ible from the effects. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> The Arch-Bi&s;hop's heart was &s;et upon the Advancement of the Church, in which he well knew, he had the King's full Concurrence, which he thought would be too powerful for any oppo&s;ition; and that he &s;hould need no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Nation generally, as was &s;aid before, was without any ill talent to the Church, either in the point of the Doctrine, or the Di&s;cipline, yet they were not without a jealou&s;y that Popery was not enough di&s;countenanced, and were very aver&s;e from admitting any thing they had not been u&s;ed to, which they call'd Innovation, and were ea&s;ily per&s;waded, that any thing of that kind was but to plea&s;e the Papi&s;ts. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Some doctrinal Points in Controver&s;y had been, in the late years, agi|tated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warm Conten|tions concern|ing tho&s;e call'd the $word$ Points.</NOTE> in the Pulpits with more warmth and reflections, than had u&s;ed to be; and thence the heat, and animo&s;ity increa&s;ed in Books <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> upon the &s;ame Arguments: mo&s;t of the popular Preachers, who had not look'd into the Ancient Learning, took <HI>Calvin's</HI> word for it, and did all they could to propagate his Opinions in tho&s;e Points: they, who had &s;tudied more, and were better ver&s;ed in the Antiquities of the Church, the Fathers, the Councils, and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tories, with the &s;ame heat and pa&s;&s;ion in Preaching and Writing defended the contrary.</P>

<P>THOUGH there were other Books written with good learning, and which &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd the Bi&s;hop's book, and to men of equal, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Inclinations, fully vindicated the Proceedings which had been, and were &s;till very fervently carried on; yet it was done by Men, who&s;e names were not much reverenced, and who were taken notice of, with great in&s;olence and a&s;perity to undertake the Defence of all things which the People generally were Di&s;plea&s;ed with, and who did not affect <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to be much Cared for, by tho&s;e of their own Order. So that from this unhappy Subject, not in it &s;elf of that important value to be either entred upon with that Re&s;olution, or to be carried on with that Pa&s;&s;ion, proceeded upon the matter a Schi&s;m among&s;t the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves, and a great deal of Uncharitablene&s;s in the learned, and moderate Cler|gy, towards one another: which, though it could not increa&s;e the ma|lice, added very much to the ability and power of the Enemies of the Church to do it hurt, and al&s;o to the number of them. For without doubt, many who lov'd the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government of the Church, and the Exerci&s;e of Religion as it was u&s;ed, and de&s;ired not a change in ei|ther, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> nor did di&s;like the order and decency which they &s;aw mended, yet they liked not any Novelties, and &s;o were liable to entertain Jealou&s;ies that more was intended, than was hitherto propo&s;ed; e&s;pecially when tho&s;e Infu&s;ions proceeded from Men un&s;u&s;pected to have any incli|nations to Change, and known A&s;&s;ertors of the Government both in Church and State. They did ob&s;erve the Inferior Clergy took more upon them, than they were wont, and did not live towards their Neighbours of Quality, or their Patrons them&s;elves, with that Civili|ty and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, they had u&s;ed to do; which di&s;po&s;ed Them like|wi&s;e to a withdrawing their good Countenance, and good Neighbour|hood <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> from them.</P>

Whereupon one day he took the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> a&s;ide (being in|form'd that he di&s;liked it, and, according to his natural cu&s;tom, &s;pake with great warmth again&s;t it) and told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;he &s;hould do very well to give the King good Coun&s;el, and to withdraw him from a Re&s;olution, in which his Honour,</Q> and Ju&s;tice was &s;o much call'd in que&s;tion. <HI>Cot|tington</HI> an&s;wer'd him very gravely, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the thing de&s;ign'd was very Lawful, and he thought the King re&s;olv'd very well, &s;ince the Place lay &s;o conveniently for his Winter exerci&s;e, and that he &s;hould by it <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> not be compell'd to make &s;o long Journeys, as he u&s;ed to do, in that Sea|&s;on of the year, for his Sport, and that nobody ought to di&s;&s;wade him from it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Arch-Bi&s;hop in&s;tead of finding a Concurrence from him, as he expected, &s;eeing him&s;elf Reproach'd upon the matter for his Opinion, grew into much Pa&s;&s;ion, telling him, <Q>&startq;&endq;Such men, as he, would Ruin the King, and make him loo&s;e the Affections of his Subjects; that for his own part, as he had begun, &s;o he would go on to di&s;&s;wade the King from proceeding in &s;o Ill a coun&s;el, and that he hoped it would appear who had been his Coun&s;ellor.</Q> <HI>Cottington</HI> glad to &s;ee him &s;o &s;oon hot, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and re&s;olv'd to inflame him more, very calmly replied to him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he thought a man could not, with a good Con&s;cience, hinder the King from pur&s;uing his Re&s;olutions, and that it could not but proceed from want of affection to his Per&s;on, and he was not &s;ure, that it might not be high Trea&s;on.</Q> The other, upon the wildne&s;s of his di&s;cour&s;e, in great anger ask'd him, <Q>&startq;&endq;Why? from whence he had receiv'd that do|ctrine? he &s;aid, with the &s;ame temper, "They who did not wi&s;h the King's health, could not love him; and they, who went about to hin|der his taking recreation, which pre&s;erv'd his health, might be thought, for ought he knew,</Q> guilty of the highe&s;t Crimes. Upon which the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Arch-Bi&s;hop in great rage, and with many reproaches left him, and ei|ther pre&s;ently, or upon the next opportunity told the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he now knew who was his great Coun&s;ellor for making his Park, and that he did not wonder that men dur&s;t not repre&s;ent any Arguments to the contrary, or let his Maje&s;ty know how much he Suffer'd in it, when &s;uch Principles in Divinity,</Q> and Law, were laid down to Terrify them; and &s;o recounted to him the Conference he had with the Lord <HI>Cotting|ton,</HI> bitterly inveighing again&s;t Him, and his Doctrine, mentioning him with all the &s;harp Reproaches imaginable, and be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty "that His coun&s;el might not Prevail with him, taking &s;ome pains to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> make his Conclu&s;ions appear very Fal&s;e, and Ridiculous.</P>
<P>THE King &s;aid no more, but, <Q>&startq;&endq;My Lord, you are deceiv'd, <HI>Cotting|ton</HI> is too hard for you; upon my word he hath not only Di&s;&s;waded me

<P>WHATSOEVER was the Cau&s;e of it, this excellent Man, who &s;tood not upon the advantage ground before, from the time of his Promotion to the Arch-Bi&s;hoprick, or rather from that of his being Commi&s;&s;ioner <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of the Trea&s;ury, exceedingly provoked, or underwent the Envy, and Reproach, and Malice of men of all Qualities, and Conditions; who agreed in nothing el&s;e: all which, though well enough Known to him, were not enough Con&s;ider'd by him, who believ'd, as mo&s;t men did, the Government to be &s;o firmly Settled, that it could neither be Shaken from within, nor without, and that le&s;s than a general Confu&s;ion of Law and Go&s;pel, could not hurt him; which was true too; but he did not Fore&s;ee how ea&s;ily that Confu&s;ion might be brought to pa&s;s, as it proved &s;hortly to be.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the King's re|turn thence, relating chiefly to the compo|&s;ing a Liturgy and Canons.</NOTE> _IT was towards the end of the Year 1633, when the King return'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> having left it to the Care of &s;ome of the Bi|&s;hops there to provide &s;uch a Liturgy, and &s;uch a Book of Canons, as might be&s;t &s;uit the nature and humour of the Better &s;ort of that People; to which the re&s;t would ea&s;ily &s;ub|mit: and that, as fa&s;t as they made them ready, they &s;hould tran&s;mit them to the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to who&s;e a&s;&s;i|&s;tance the King joyn'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Wren,</HI> who, by that time, was become Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich;</HI> a man of a &s;evere, &s;owr nature, but very Learned, and particularly ver&s;ed in the old Liturgies of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches. And after his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be this way certified of what was &s;o &s;ent, he would recommend, and enjoyn the Practice and U&s;e of both to that his Native Kingdom. The Bi&s;hops there had &s;omewhat to do, before they went about the preparing the Canons, and the Liturgy; what had pa&s;s'd at the King's being there in Parliament, had left bitter Inclinations, and unruly Spirits in many of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the mo&s;t popular Nobility; who watch'd only for an opportunity to inflame the People, and were well-enough contented to &s;ee Combu&s;tible matter every day gather'd together, to contribute to that Fire.</P>
<P>THE promoting &s;o many Bi&s;hops to be of the Privy-Council, and to &s;it in the Courts of Ju&s;tice, &s;eem'd at fir&s;t wonderfully to facilitate all
<PB N="84" REF="1080">
that was in de&s;ign, and to create an affection and reverence towards the Church, at lea&s;t an application to and dependence upon the greate&s;t Church-men. So that there &s;eem'd to be not only a good preparation made with the People, but a general expectation, and even a de&s;ire that they might have a Liturgy, and more Decency ob&s;erv'd in the Church. And this Temper was believ'd to be the more univer&s;al, becau&s;e neither from any of the Nobility, nor of the Clergy, who were thought mo&s;t aver&s;e from it, there appear'd any &s;ign of Contradiction, nor that licence of Language again&s;t it, as was natural to that Nation; but an entire Ac|quie&s;cence in all the Bi&s;hops thought fit to do; which was interpreted <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to proceed from a conver&s;ion in their Judgement, at lea&s;t to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Authority: whereas in truth, it appear'd afterwards to be from the ob&s;ervation they made of the Temper, and Indi&s;cretion of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops in the greate&s;t Authority, that they were like to have more Advantages admini&s;tred to them by Their ill Managery, than they could rai&s;e by any Contrivance of their own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Ca|$$$$</NOTE> IT was now two Years, or very near &s;o much, before the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Scotland</HI> had prepared any thing to offer to the King towards their in|tended Reformation; and then they Inverted the proper method, and fir&s;t pre&s;ented a body of Canons to precede the Liturgy, which was not yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> ready, they choo&s;ing to fini&s;h the &s;horter work fir&s;t. The King refer'd the con&s;ideration of the Canons, as he had before re&s;olv'd to do, to the Arch-Bi&s;hop, and the other two Bi&s;hops formerly named, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich;</HI> who, after their peru&s;al of them, and &s;ome Alterations made, with the con&s;ent of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops who brought them from <HI>Scotland,</HI> return'd them to the King; and his Ma|je&s;ty, impatient to &s;ee the good work entred upon&punc; without any other Ceremony (after having given his Royal approbation) i&s;&s;ued out his Pro|clamation for the due Ob&s;ervation of them within his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>IT was a fatal Inadvertency that the&s;e Canons, neither before, nor af|ter they were &s;ent to the King, had been ever Seen by the A&s;&s;embly, or any Convocation of the Clergy, which was &s;o &s;trictly obliged to the Ob&s;ervation of them; nor &s;o much as Communicated to the Lords of the Council of that Kingdom; it being allmo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that any new Di&s;cipline could be introduced into the Church, which would not Much concern the Government of the State, and even trench upon, or refer to the Muncipal Laws of the Kingdom. And, in this con&s;ideration, the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had allways declared to the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was Their part to be &s;ure, that nothing they &s;hould pro|po&s;e <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to the King in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Church, &s;hould be contrary to the Laws of the Land, which He could not be thought to under&s;tand; and that they &s;hould never put any thing in execution, without the con&s;ent and approbation of the Privy-Council.</Q> But it was the unhappy Craft of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops to get it believ'd by the King, that the work would be Grateful to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Nobility, the Clergy, and the People (which they could hardly believe) in order to the obtaining his Maje&s;ty's Approbation, and Authority for the execution of that, which they did really believe would not find Oppo&s;ition from the Nobility, Clergy, or People, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Power, and Will, which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> without doubt was then in great Veneration in that Kingdom; and &s;o they did not, in truth, dare to &s;ubmit tho&s;e Canons to any other Exami|nation, than what the King &s;hould direct in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="1090">
IT was, in the next place, as &s;trange, that Canons &s;hould be publi&s;h'd before the Liturgy was prepared (which was not ready in a year after, or thereabouts) when three or four of the Canons were principally for the Ob&s;ervation of, and punctual Compliance with the Liturgy; which all the Clergy were to be &s;worn to &s;ubmit to, and to pay all obedience to what was enjoyn'd by it, before they knew what it contain'd. Whereas if the Liturgy had been fir&s;t publi&s;h'd with all due Circum&s;tances, it is po&s;&s;ible that it might have found a better reception, and the Canons have been le&s;s examin'd.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> THE <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation, how capable &s;oever it was of being led by &s;ome Great men, and mi&s;led by the Clergy, would have been corrupted by neither into a barefaced Rebellion again&s;t their King, who&s;e Per&s;on they lov'd, and reverenced his Government; nor could they have been wrought upon towards the le&s;&s;ening the one, or the other, by any other Sugge&s;tions, or Infu&s;ions, than &s;uch as &s;hould make them jealous, or ap|prehen&s;ive of a de&s;ign to introduce Popery; a great part of their Reli|gion con&s;i&s;ting in an entire dete&s;tation of Popery, in believing the Pope to be Antichri&s;t, and hating perfectly the Per&s;ons of all Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE Canons now publi&s;h'd, be&s;ides (as hath been touch'd before) that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> they had pa&s;s'd no Approbation of the Clergy, or been Communicated to the Council, appear'd to be &s;o many new Laws impo&s;ed upon the whole Kingdom by the King's &s;ole Authority, and contrived by a few Private men, of whom they had no good opinion, and who were Strangers to the Nation; &s;o that it was thought no other than a Subjection to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by receiving Laws from thence, of which they were mo&s;t jealous, and which they mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately abhor'd. Then they were &s;o far from being confined to the Church, and the matters of Religion, that they believ'd there was no part of their Civil Government uninvaded by them, and no Per&s;ons of what Quality &s;oever unconcern'd, and, as they <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> thought, unhurt in them. And there were &s;ome things in &s;ome parti|cular Canons, how rational &s;oever in them&s;elves, and how di&s;tant &s;oever in the words and expre&s;&s;ions from inclining to Popery, which yet gave too much advantage to Tho&s;e who maliciou&s;ly watch'd the occa&s;ion, to per&s;wade Weak men that it was an Approach, and Introduction to that Religion, the very Imagination whereof Intoxicated all men, and de|prived them of all faculties to Examine, and Judge.</P>
<P>SOME of the &s;aid Canons defined, and determin'd &s;uch an unlimited <Q>&startq;&endq;Power, and Prerogative to be in the King, according to the Pattern (in expre&s;s terms) "of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;uch a full Supremacy in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> all Ca&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as hath never been pretended to by their former Kings,</Q> or &s;ubmitted to by the Clergy, and Laity of that Nation; which made impre&s;&s;ion upon men of all tempers, humours, and inclina|tions; <Q>&startq;&endq;And that no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;on &s;hould become Surety, or Bound for any man; that National, or General A&s;&s;emblies &s;hould be call'd only by the King's Authority; that all Bi&s;hops, and other Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, who dy without Children, &s;hould be obliged to give a good part of their E&s;tates to the Church, and, though they &s;hould have Children, yet to leave &s;omewhat to the Church, and for advance|ment of Learning;</Q> which &s;eem'd rather to be matter of State, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Policy, than of Religion; thwarted their Laws and Cu&s;toms, which had been ob&s;erv'd by them; le&s;&s;en'd, if not took away the Credit of Church-men; and prohibited them from that liberty of Commerce in Civil affairs, which the Laws permitted to them; and reflected upon the

<P>ALL the&s;e were new, and things with which they had not been ac|quainted; and though they might be fit to be commended to a regular, and orderly People piou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, yet it was too &s;trong meat for In|fants in Di&s;cipline, and too much nouri&s;hment to be admini&s;tred at Once to weak, and quea&s;y Stomachs, and too much inclined to nau&s;eate what was mo&s;t whole&s;ome.

<P>IT was now ea&s;y for Them, who had tho&s;e Inclinations, to &s;ugge&s;t to men of all conditions that here was an entire new Model of Govern|ment in Church and State; the King might do what he would upon them all, and the Church was nothing but what the Bi&s;hops would have it be: which they every day infu&s;ed into the minds of the People, with all the Artifices which admini&s;ter Jealou&s;ies of all kinds to tho&s;e, who are liable to be di&s;quieted with them: yet they would not &s;uffer (which &s;hew'd wonderful power, and wonderful dexterity) any di&s;order to break <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> out upon all this occa&s;ion, but all was quiet, except &s;preading of Libels again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and propagating that Spirit as much as they could, by their Corre&s;pondence in <HI>England;</HI> where they found too many every day tran&s;ported by the &s;ame Infu&s;ions, in expectation that the&s;e Seeds of Jealou&s;y from the Canons would grow apace, and produce &s;uch a Re|ception for the Liturgy as they wi&s;h'd for.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Li|turgy</NOTE> IT was about the month of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1637, that the Liturgy (after it had been &s;ent out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and peru&s;ed by the three Bi&s;hops in <HI>England,</HI> and then approved and confirm'd by the King) was Publi&s;h'd, and appointed to be Read in all the Churches. And in this particular <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> there was the &s;ame affected and premeditated Omi&s;&s;ion, as had been in the preparation and publication of the Canons; the Clergy not at all con|&s;ulted in it, and, which was more &s;trange, not all the Bi&s;hops acquainted

with it; which was le&s;s cen&s;ured afterwards, when &s;ome of them re|nounced their Function, and became ordinary Presbyters, as &s;oon as they &s;aw the current of the time. The Privy-Council had no other notice of it, than all the Kingdom had, the Sunday before, when it was declared, "that the next Sunday the Liturgy &s;hould be Read; by which they were the le&s;s concern'd to fore&s;ee, or prevent any Ob&s;tructions which might happen.</P>
<P>THE Proclamation had appointed it to be read the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> before, but the Earl of <HI>Traquaire</HI> High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Scotland</HI> (who was the on|ly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Coun&s;ellor or Layman relyed upon by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in that bu&s;ine&s;s) per&s;waded the King to defer it till <HI>July,</HI> that &s;ome good preparation might be made for the more chearful Reception of it. And as this pau&s;e gave the di&s;contented Party more heart, and more time for their &s;editious Negotiations, &s;o the ill Con&s;equences of it, or the Actions which were &s;ub&s;equent to it, made Him &s;u&s;pected to be Privy to all the Con&s;piracy, and to be an Enemy to the Church; though in truth there neither appear'd then, nor in all the very unfortunate part of his life af|terwards, any ju&s;t ground for that accu&s;ation, and &s;u&s;picion; but as he was exceedingly obliged to the Arch-Bi&s;hop, &s;o he was a man of great <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Parts, and well affected to the Work in hand in his own judgement; and if he had been as much depended upon, to have advi&s;ed the Bi&s;hops in the Pro&s;ecution, and for the Conduct of it, as he was to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the carrying on what&s;oever They propo&s;ed, it is very probable, that either &s;o Much would not have been undertaken together, or that it would have Succeeded better; for he was without doubt not inferior to any of that Nation in Wi&s;dom, and Dexterity. And though he was often pro|voked, by the In&s;olence of &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, to a Di&s;like of their over|much Fervour, and too little Di&s;cretion, his Integrity to the King was without blemi&s;h, and his Affection to the Church &s;o notorious, that he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> never de&s;erted it, till both It and He were over-run, and trod under foot; and they, who were the mo&s;t notorious Per&s;ecutors of It, never left Per|&s;ecuting Him to the death.</P>
<P>NOR was any thing done which he had propo&s;ed, for the better Ad|ju&s;ting things in the time of that Su&s;pen&s;ion, but every thing left in the &s;ame &s;tate of Unconcernedne&s;s as it was before; not &s;o much as the Coun|cil's being better Inform'd of it; as if they had been &s;ure, that all men would have Submitted to it for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>ON the Sunday morning appointed for the work, the Chancellor of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner how that Li|turgy was re|ceiv'd at <HI>E|denborough.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Scotland,</HI> and others of the Council, being pre&s;ent in the Cathedral <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Church, the Dean begun to read the Liturgy, which he had no &s;ooner entred upon, but a noi&s;e and clamour was rai&s;ed throughout the Church, that no words could be heard di&s;tinctly, and then a &s;hower of Stones, and Sticks, and Cudgels were thrown at the Dean's head. The Bi&s;hop went up into the Pulpit, and from thence put them in mind of the Sa|credne&s;s of the Place, of their Duty to God and the King; but he found no more Reverence, nor was the clamour and di&s;order le&s;s than before. The Chancellor, from his Seat, commanded the Provo&s;t and Magi|&s;trates of the City to de&s;cend from the Gallery in which they &s;ate, and by their Authority to Suppre&s;s the Riot; which at la&s;t with great Diffi|culty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> they did, by driving the Rude&s;t of tho&s;e who made the di&s;turbance out of the Church, and &s;hutting the Doors; which gave the Dean oppor|tunity to proceed in the reading of the Liturgy, that was not at all at|tended or hearkned to by tho&s;e who remain'd within the Church; and if

it had, they who were turn'd out continued their barbarous Noi&s;e, broke the Windows, and endeavour'd to break down the Doors; &s;o that it was not po&s;&s;ible for any to follow their Devotions.</P>
<P>WHEN all was done that at that time could be done there, and the Council and Magi&s;trates went out of the Church to their Hou&s;es, the Rabble follow'd the Bi&s;hops with all the opprobrious language they could invent, of bringing in Super&s;tition and Popery into the Kingdom, and making the people Slaves; and were not content to u&s;e their Tongues, but employ'd their Hands too in throwing Dirt and Stones at them; and treated the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> whom they look'd upon as mo&s;t <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"> Active that way, &s;o Rudely, that with difficulty he got into a Hou&s;e, after they had torn his Habit, and was from thence removed to his own, with great hazard of his Life. As this was the Reception it had in the Cathedral, &s;o it fared not better in the other Churches of the City, but was entertain'd with the &s;ame Hollowing and Out-cries; and threatning the Men who&s;e office it was to read it, with the &s;ame bitter Execrations again&s;t Bi&s;hops and Popery.</P>
<P>HITHERTO no per&s;on of Condition or Name appear'd, or &s;eem'd to countenance this &s;editious Confu&s;ion; it was the Rabble, of which no|body was named, and which is more &s;trange, not one apprehended: and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> it &s;eems the Bi&s;hops thought it not of Moment enough to de&s;ire, or re|quire any Help, or Protection from the Council; but without confer|ring with them, or applying them&s;elves to them, they di&s;patch'd away an Expre&s;s to the King, with a full and particular Information of all that had pa&s;s'd, and a de&s;ire that He would take that cour&s;e he thought be&s;t for the carrying on his Service.</P>
<P>UNTIL this Adverti&s;ement arrived from <HI>Scotland,</HI> there were very few in <HI>England</HI> who had heard of any Di&s;orders there, or of any thing done there which might produce any. The King him&s;elf had been all|ways &s;o jealous of the Priviledges of that his Native Kingdom (as hath <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> been touch&punc;d before) and that it might not be di&s;honour&punc;d by a &s;u&s;picion of having any Dependence upon <HI>England,</HI> that he never &s;uffer&punc;d any thing relating to That to be Debated, or &s;o much as Communicated to his Privy-Council in This (though many of that Nation were, without di&s;tinction, Coun&s;ellors of <HI>England)</HI> but handled all tho&s;e affairs Him|&s;elf with two or three <HI>Scots</HI>-men, who allways attended in the Court for the bu&s;ine&s;s of that Kingdom, which was upon the matter &s;till di&s;patch'd by the &s;ole advice and direction of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton.</HI></P>
<P>AND the truth is, there was &s;o little curio&s;ity either in the Court, or the Country, to know any thing of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or what was done there, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> that when the whole Nation was &s;ollicitous to know what pa&s;s'd weekly in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and all other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> no man ever en|quired what was doing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor had that Kingdom a place or mention in one Page of any Gazette; and even after the Adverti&s;ement of this preamble to Rebellion, no mention was made of it at the Coun|cil-Board, but &s;uch a Di&s;patch made into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon it, as expre&s;s'd the King's di&s;like and di&s;plea&s;ure, and obliged the Lords of the Council there to appear more vigorou&s;ly in the Vindication of his Authority, and Suppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Tumults.

And if the Lords of the Council i&s;&s;ued out any Order again&s;t them, or if the King him&s;elf &s;ent a Proclamation for their repair to their Hou&s;es, and for the pre&s;ervation of the Peace, pre&s;ently &s;ome Nobleman deputed by the Tables publi&s;hed a Prote&s;tation again&s;t <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> tho&s;e Orders and Proclamations, with the &s;ame confidence, and with as much formality, as if the Government were regularly in Their hands.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> IT is very true, there were very many of the Nobility, and Per&s;ons of principal Quality of that Nation, and in <HI>Edengborouh</HI> at that time, who did not appear yet, and concur in this Seditious behaviour, or own their being yet of their Party; but on the contrary &s;eem'd very much

<P>HE could now no longer defer the acquinting the Council-Board, and the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> with the Indignities he had &s;u|&s;tain'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which he did by Proclamations and Declararations at large, &s;etting out the whole Proceedings which had been; and in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> end of the Year 1638 declared his Re&s;olution to rai&s;e an Army to Sup|pre&s;s their Rebellion, for which he gave pre&s;ent order.</P>

<P>GOD Allmighty would not &s;uffer this di&s;cerning Spirit of Wi&s;dom to govern at this time: the King thought it unju&s;t to condemn a Nation for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a part of it, and &s;till hoped to redeem if from the infamy of a General Defection by the exemplary Fidelity of a Superior Party, and therefore withdrew not his Confidence from any of Tho&s;e who attended his Per&s;on, who, intruth, lay leiger for the Covenant, and kept up the &s;pirits of their Country-men by Their intelligence.</P>

<P>IT was therefore thought fit by the whole body of the Council, that a &s;hort Prote&s;tation &s;hould be drawn, in which all men &s;hould <Q>&startq;&endq;profe&s;s their Loyalty and Obedience to his Maje&s;ty, and di&s;claim and renounce the having any Intelligence, or holding any Corre&s;pondence with the Rebels.</Q> No man imagin'd it po&s;&s;ible that any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would re|fu&s;e to make that Prote&s;tation; and they who thought worr&s;t of the <HI>Scots,</HI> did not think they would make any Scruple of doing the &s;ame, and con|&s;equently that there would be no Fruit, or Di&s;covery from that Te&s;t; but they were deceiv'd: the <HI>Scots</HI> indeed took it to a man, without grieving <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> their Con&s;cience, or reforming their Manners.

<P>THE Hor&s;e had out-march'd the Foot, which, by rea&s;on of the ex|ce&s;&s;ive Heat, was not able to u&s;e great expedition: be&s;ides there was &s;ome error in the Orders, and &s;ome accidents of the Night that had retarded them; &s;o that when the Enemy appear'd fir&s;t in view, the Foot and the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Artillery was three or four Miles behind.</P>

And therefore as &s;oon as the Earl came in view, he di&s;patch'd Me&s;&s;engers one after another to the King, with an account of what he heard and &s;aw, or believ'd he &s;aw; and yet thought not fit to &s;tay for an An&s;wer; but with the joint Con|&s;ent <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of all his chief Officers (for it was never after pretended that any one Officer of name Di&s;&s;waded it, though they were &s;till A&s;hamed of it) Retired towards his Foot, to whom he had likewi&s;e &s;ent Orders not to Advance; and &s;o Wearied and Tired by the length of the March, and more by the heat of the Weather, which was intolerable, they return'd to the Camp, where the King was; and the <HI>Scots</HI> drew a little back, to a more convenient Po&s;t for their re&s;idence.</P>

<P>THE Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> gave another kind of Reception to the Letters they receiv'd.

The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had merited very well throughout the whole Affair, and had never made a fal&s;e &s;tep in Action or Coun&s;el, was di&s;charged in the Croud, without or|dinary Ceremony; and an accident happening at the &s;ame time, or very &s;oon after, by the death of the Lord <HI>A&s;ton,</HI> whereby the Command of the Forre&s;t of <HI>Needwood</HI> fell into the King's di&s;po&s;al, which lay at the very door of that Earl's E&s;tate, and would infinitely have gratified him, was denied to Him, and be&s;tow'd upon Another: all which wrought very <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> much upon his high Nature, and made him &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome Im|pre&s;&s;ions afterwards, which otherwi&s;e would not have found &s;uch ca&s;y admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Factions and Animo&s;ities at Court were either greater, or more vi&s;ible, than they had been before. The Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> (who was Governour to the Prince, and one of the mo&s;t Valuable men in the King|dom, in his Fortune, in his Dependences, and in his Qualifications) had, at his Own charge, drawn together a goodly Troop of Hor&s;e of two hun|dred; which for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ted of the be&s;t Gentlemen of the North, who were either Allied to the Earl, or of immediate Dependence <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> upon him, and came together purely upon His account; and call'd this Troop <HI>the Prince of</HI> Wales<HI>'s Troop;</HI> whereof the Earl him&s;elf was Captain. When the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> march'd with that Party into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> accompanied him with that Troop, and upon occa&s;ion of &s;ome Orders, de&s;ired that Troop, &s;ince it belong'd to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> might have &s;ome Precedence; which the General of the Hor&s;e refu&s;ed to grant him, but required him to march in the rank he had pre&s;cribed; and the other obey'd it accordingly, but with re&s;ent|ment; imputing it to the little kindne&s;s that was between them. But as &s;oon as the Army was Disbanded, he &s;ent a Challenge to the Earl of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <HI>Holland,</HI> by a Gentleman very punctual, and well acquainted with tho&s;e Errands; who took a proper &s;ea&s;on to mention it to him, without a po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;u&s;picion. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was never &s;u&s;pected to want Courage, yet in This occa&s;ion he &s;hew'd not that alacrity, but that the

<P>THE King him&s;elf was very Melancholick, and quickly di&s;cern'd that he had lo&s;t Reputation at home and abroad; and tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors who had been mo&s;t Faulty, either through want of Courage or Wi&s;dom (for at that time few of them wanted Fidelity) never afterwards re|cover'd Spirit enough to do their Duty, but gave them&s;elves up to Tho&s;e who had &s;o much Over-witted them; every man &s;hifting the Fault from him&s;elf, and finding &s;ome Friend to excu&s;e him: and it being yet nece&s;|&s;ary, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> that &s;o Infamous a matter &s;hould not be cover'd with ab&s;olute Oblivion, it fell to Secretary <HI>Coke's</HI> turn (for whom nobody cared) who was then near four&s;core years of age, to be made the Sacrifice; and, upon pretence that he had Omitted the writing what he ought to have done, and In&s;erted &s;omewhat he ought Not to have done, he was put out of his Office; and within a&s;hort time after, S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> (who was Trea&s;urer of the Hou&s;e) by the dark Contrivance of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and by the open and vi&s;ible Power of the Queen, made Secretary of State; which was the only thing that could make the Removal of the other old man Cen&s;ured and Murmur'd at: and this was attended again with a de|clared <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and un&s;ea&s;onable Di&s;like and Di&s;plea&s;ure in the Queen again&s;t the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> newly made Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> who out of &s;ome kindne&s;s to the old man, who had been much tru&s;ted by him and of u&s;e to him, and out of contempt and dete&s;tation of <HI>Vane,</HI> but principally out of a de&s;ire to have that Mi&s;carriage exp$ated by a greater Sacrifice, oppo&s;ed the Removal of Secretary <HI>Coke</HI> with all the intere&s;t he could, got it Su&s;pended for &s;ome time, and put the Queen to the exerci&s;e of her full power to Perfect her work; which afterwards produced many &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ters. So that this unhappy Pacification kindled many Fires of Contention in Court and Country, though the Flame broke out fir&s;t <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> again in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, the <HI>Scots</HI> got &s;o much Benefit and Advantage by it, that they brought all their other mi&s;chievous Devices to pa&s;s, with ea&s;e, and a pro&s;perous Gale in all they wentabout. They had before little Cre|dit abroad in any Forreign parts, and &s;o could procure neither Arms nor Ammunition; and though they could lead the People at Home, out of the hatred and jealou&s;y of Popery, into unruly Tumults, yet they had not Authority&punc; enough over them to engage them in a firm re&s;olution of Rebellion: the Opinion of their unque&s;tionable Duty and Loyalty to the King, was that which had given them reputation to Affront him: nor <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> dur&s;t they yet attempt to lay any Tax or Impo&s;ition upon the People, or to put them to any Charge. But, after this Pacification, they appear'd much more Con&s;iderable abroad and at home; Abroad, where they were not &s;o much con&s;ider'd before, now that they had brought an Army into the Field again&s;t the King, and gain'd all they pretended to de&s;ire without reproach or blemi&s;h, <HI>France,</HI> their old Ally, look'd upon them as good In&s;truments to di&s;turb their Neighbours; and Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> (who had never look'd upon the Defeat and Overthrow at the I&s;le of <HI>Ree,</HI> as any reparation for the Attempt and Dishonour of the Inva&s;ion) was very glad of the opportunity of Di&s;turbing a Re&s;t and Quiet, which had not <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> been favourable to His de&s;igns; and &s;ent an Agent privately to <HI>Eden|borough,</HI> to cheri&s;h and foment their Unpeaceable Inclinations; and re|ceiv'd Another from thence, who &s;ollicited Supplies, and communicated

Coun&s;els: he &s;ent them Arms and Ammunition, and promi&s;ed them Encouragement and A&s;&s;i&s;tance proportionable to any Enterprize they &s;hould frankly engage them&s;elves in. <HI>Holland</HI> entred into a clo&s;er cor|re&s;pondence with them; and they found Credit there for a great &s;tock of Arms and Ammunition, upon Security of payment within a Year; which Security they ea&s;ily found a way to give. And thus Countenanced, and Supplied, they quickly got Credit and Power over the people at Home; and as &s;oon as they had form'd &s;ome Troops of tho&s;e who had been li&s;ted by them under good Officers (whereof &s;tore re&s;orted to them of that Na|tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> out of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden)</HI> and a&s;&s;ign'd Pay to them, they made no longer &s;cruple to Impo&s;e what Money they thought fit upon the Peo|ple, and to levy it with all Rigour upon them who refu&s;ed, or expre&s;s'd any unwillingne&s;s to &s;ubmit to the Impo&s;ition; and made the re&s;idence of any among&s;t them very unea&s;y, and very in&s;ecure, who were but &s;u&s;pected by them not to wi&s;h well to their Proceedings: and &s;o they renew'd all tho&s;e Forms for the Admini&s;tration of the Government, which they had begun in the beginning of the Di&s;orders, and which they di&s;claim'd upon making the Pacification; and refu&s;ed to &s;uffer the King's Governour of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenborough</HI> (which was put into his hands <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> about the &s;ame time) either to repair &s;ome Works which were newly fall'n down, or &s;o much as to buy Provi&s;ion in the Town for the food of the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT that which was the greate&s;t Benefit and Advantage that accrew'd to them from the Agreement, and which was worth all the re&s;t, was the conver&s;ation they had with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with &s;o much Reputation, that they had per&s;waded very many to believe, that they had all manner of Fidelity to the King, and had too much cau&s;e to complain of the hard Proceedings again&s;t them by the Power of &s;ome of their own Country|men; and the Acquaintance they made with &s;ome particular Lords, to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that degree, that They did upon the matter agree what was to be done for the future, and how to ob&s;truct any Oppo&s;ition or Proceedings by tho&s;e who were look'd upon as Enemies by both Sides: for none in <HI>Scot|land</HI> more Di&s;liked all that was done in Court, and the chief Actors there, than Tho&s;e Lords of <HI>England</HI> did; though They were not &s;o well pre|pared for an Expedient for the cure.</P>
<P>THE People of <HI>Scotland</HI> being now reduced by Them to a more im|plicit Obedience, and nobody daring to oppo&s;e the mo&s;t extravagant pro|ceedings of the mo&s;t violent per&s;ons in Power, they lo&s;t no time, as hath been &s;aid, to make all preparations for a War they meant to pur&s;ue.

The King con&s;ider'd it on|ly as the effect of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and took no other care to prevent it but by heaping every day new obligations upon him; making him a Privy-Coun&s;ellor, and giving him other Offices and power to do Hurt, thereby to Re&s;train him from doing it; which would have wrought upon any Ge|nerous Nature the Effect it ought to have done. The Earl (for his Father <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> was now dead) came not to <HI>Edenborough</HI> during the fir&s;t Troubles; and though he did not di&s;&s;emble his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e one of them had Affronted him, intruth, very Rudely, yet he renew'd all imaginable profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to the King and a readine&s;s to en|gage in his Service, if tho&s;e Di&s;orders &s;hould continue: but after the Pa|cification, and Disbanding of the King's Army, and the Covenanters de|claring that they would adhere to the Acts of the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> he made ha&s;t to <HI>Edenborough</HI> with a great train of his Family and Fol|lowers; and immediately &s;ign'd the Covenant, engaged for the provi|&s;ion of Arms, and rai&s;ing Forces; and in all things behaved him&s;elf like <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> a man that might very &s;afely be confided in by that Party.</P>

The Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> Earl Mar&s;hal of <HI>England,</HI> was made <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Lord Steward of the King's Hou&s;e; an Office nece&s;&s;ary in the beginning of a Parliament; being to &s;wear all the Members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons before they could &s;it there.

<P>THE Hou&s;e met all ways at eight of the Clock, and ro&s;e at twelve; which were the old Parliament hours; that the Committees, upon whom the greate&s;t burden of the bu&s;ine&s;s lay, might have the afternoons for Their preparation and di&s;patch. It was not the Cu&s;tom to enter upon <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> any Important bu&s;ine&s;s in the fir&s;t Fortnight; both becau&s;e many Mem|bers u&s;ed to be ab&s;ent &s;o long; and that time was u&s;ually thought nece&s;|&s;ary for the appointment and nomination of Committees, and for other Ceremonies and Preparations that were u&s;ual: but there was no regard Now to that Cu&s;tom; and the appearance of the Members was very great, there having been a large time between the i&s;&s;uing out of the Writs and the meeting of the Parliament, &s;o that all Elections were made, and return'd, and every body was willing to fall to the Work.</P>

<P>THOUGH the Parliament had not fate above &s;ix or &s;even days, and had managed all their Debates, and their whole Behaviour with won|derful order and &s;obriety, the Court was Impatient that no advance was yet made towards a Supply; which was fore&s;een would take up much time, when&s;oever they went about it, though never &s;o cordially; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of $span$ to $span$</NOTE> therefore they prevail'd with the Hou&s;e of Peers, which was more en|tirely at the King's di&s;po&s;al, that they would demand a Conference with the Hou&s;e of Commons, and then propo&s;e to them, by way of advice, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would begin with giving the King a Supply, in regard of the urgency and even nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, and afterwards proceed upon their Grievances,</Q> or any thing el&s;e as they thought fit&punc; and the Hou&s;e of Peers accordingly did give their advice to this purpo&s;e at a Conference. This Conference was no &s;ooner reported in the Hou&s;e of Commons, than their whole Temper &s;eem&punc;d to be &s;haken. It was the undoubted Funda|mental priviledge of the Commons in Parliament, that all Supplies <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;hould have their ri&s;e and beginning from Them; this had never been infringed, or violated, or &s;o much as que&s;tion'd in the wor&s;t Times; and that now after &s;o long intermi&s;&s;ion of Parliaments, that all Priviledges might be forgotten, the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;hould begin with an action their Ance&s;tors never attempted, admini&s;tred too much cau&s;e of Jealou&s;y of &s;omewhat el&s;e that was intended; and &s;o with an unanimous con&s;ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">This voted a Breach of $word$ by the Commons.</NOTE> they declared it to be <Q>&startq;&endq;&s;o high a Breach of Priviledge, that they could not proceed upon any other matter untill they fir&s;t receiv'd Satisfaction and Reparation from the Hou&s;e of Peers;</Q> and which the next day they demanded a Conference.

without mentioning the nature of the Supply, the proportion or man|ner of rai&s;ing it,</Q> which they confe&s;s'd belong'd entirely to Them: in fine, they de&s;ired them, <Q>&startq;&endq;that this might be no occa&s;ion of wa&s;ting their time, but that they would proceed their Own way, and in their Own method,</Q> upon the affairs of the Kingdom.

A Committee was appointed to examine Pre&s;idents of for|mer times, in ca&s;e of violation of their Priviledges by the Lords, though not of that magnitude, and thereupon to prepare a Prote&s;tation to be &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and to be entred into their own Journal; and in the mean time no proceedings to be in the Hou&s;e upon any publick bu&s;ine&s;s, except upon &s;ome report from a Committee.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King&punc;s Propo&s;ition t$ the Hou&s;e of Commons:</NOTE> AFTER &s;ome days had pa&s;s'd in this manner, and it not being in view when this debate would be at an end, the King thought of another expe|dient, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age in writing to the Commons by S^$ <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> who was now both Secretary of State and Trea&s;urer of the Hou&s;hold, and at that time of good credit there; wherein his Maje&s;ty took notice, <Q>&startq;&endq;that there was &s;ome difference between the two Hou&s;es, which re|tarded the tran&s;action of the great affairs of the Kingdom, at a time when a forreign Army was ready to invade it: That he heard the pay|ment of Ship-money, notwith&s;tanding that it was adjudged his right, was not willingly &s;ubmitted to by the People; to manife&s;t therefore his good affection to his Subjects in general, he made this Propo&s;ition, That if the Parliament would grant him twelve Sub&s;idies to be paid <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in three years, in the manner propo&s;ed (that was, five Sub&s;idies to be paid the fir&s;t year, four the &s;econd, and three to be paid the la&s;t year) his Maje&s;ty would then relea&s;e all his title or pretence to Ship-money for the future,</Q> in &s;uch a manner as his Parliament &s;hould advi&s;e.</P>
<P>THOUGH Exceptions might have been taken again in point of Pri|viledge, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty took notice of the difference between the two Hou&s;es; yet that Spirit had not Then taken &s;o deep root: &s;o that they re&s;olv'd to enter, the next day after the delivery of it, upon a full debate of his Maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;age; they who de&s;ired to ob&s;truct the giving any Supply, believing they &s;hould ea&s;ily prevail to reject this propo&s;ition, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> upon the greatne&s;s of the &s;um demanded, without appearing not to favour the Cau&s;e in which it was to be employ'd, which they could not have done with any advantage to them&s;elves, the number of that Cla&s;&s;is of men being then not con&s;iderable in the Hou&s;e. It was about the fir&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">This debated</NOTE> day of <HI>May</HI> that the Me&s;&s;age was deliver&punc;d, and the next day it was re|&s;umed about nine of the Clock in the Morning, and the debate continued till four of the Clock in the Afternoon; which had been &s;eldom u&s;ed be|fore, but afterwards grew into cu&s;tom. Many ob&s;erv'd <Q>&startq;&endq;that they were to purcha&s;e a relea&s;e of an Impo&s;ition very Unju&s;tly laid upon the King|dom, and by purcha&s;ing it, they &s;hould upon the matter confe&s;s it had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> been Ju&s;t;</Q> which no man in his heart acknowledg'd; and therefore wi&s;h'd <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Judgment might be fir&s;t examin'd, and being once de|clared Void, what they &s;hould pre&s;ent the King with, would appear a Gift,</Q> and not a Recompence: but this was rather mode&s;tly in&s;inuated,

than in&s;i&s;ted upon; and the greater number reflected more on the Pro|portion demanded, which &s;ome of tho&s;e who were thought very well to under&s;tand the &s;tate of the Kingdom, confidently affirm'd to be more than the whole &s;tock in Money of the Kingdom amounted to; which ap|pear&punc;d &s;hortly after to be a very gro&s;s Mi&s;computation. There were very few, except tho&s;e of the Court (who were ready to give all that the King would ask, and indeed had little to give of their own) who did not be|lieve the Sum demanded to be too great, and wi&s;hed that a le&s;s might be accepted, and therefore were willing, when the day was &s;o far &s;pent, that the Debate might be adjourn&punc;d till the next morning; which was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> willingly con&s;ented to by all, and &s;o the Hou&s;e ro&s;e. All this agitation had been in a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, the Speaker having left the Chair, to which M^r <HI>Lenthall,</HI> a Lawyer of no eminent account, was call&punc;d. But there was not, in the whole day, in all the variety of contra|dictions, an offen&s;ive or angry word &s;poken: except only that one private Country Gentleman little known, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;he ob&s;erv&punc;d that the Supply was to be employ&punc;d in the &s;upporting <HI>B$llum Epi&s;copale,</HI> which he thought the Bi&s;hops were fitte&s;t to do them&s;elves:</Q> but as there was no reply, or notice taken of it, &s;o there was nobody, who &s;econded that en|vious reflexion, nor any other expre&s;&s;ion of that kind. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>THE next day as &s;oon as the Hou&s;e met, and Prayers were read, it re&s;olv'd again into a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e, the &s;ame Per&s;on being again call'd to the Chair: it was expected, and hoped, that there would have been &s;ome new me&s;&s;age from the King, that might have fa|cilitated the debate; but nothing appearing of that kind, the Propo&s;ition was again read, and men of all &s;ides di&s;cour&s;ed much of what had been &s;aid before, and many &s;poke with more reflection upon the Judgment of Ship&punc;money than they had done the day pa&s;t, and &s;eem'd to wi&s;h, <Q>&startq;&endq;that what&s;oever they &s;hould give the King &s;hould be a free te&s;timony of their affection and duty, without any relea&s;e of Ship money, which de|de&s;erv&punc;d <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> no con&s;ideration,</Q> but in a &s;hort time would appear void and null. And this &s;eem&punc;d to agree with the &s;en&s;e of &s;o great a part of the Hou&s;e, that M^$ <HI>Hambden</HI> the mo&s;t Popular man in the Hou&s;e (the &s;ame who had defended the Suit again&s;t the King in his own name, upon the Ille|gality of Ship-money&punc; thought the matter ripe for the Qne&s;tion, and de|&s;ired the Que&s;tion might be put, <Q>&startq;&endq;Whether the Hou&s;e would con&s;ent to the Propo&s;ition made by the King,</Q> as it was contain'd in the me&s;&s;age? which would have been &s;ure to have found a Negative from all who thought the Sum too great, or were not plea&s;ed that it &s;hould be given in recompence of Ship-money. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>WHEN many call&punc;d to have this Que&s;tion, Serjeant <HI>Glanvile</HI> the Speaker (who &s;ate by among&s;t the other Members whil&s;t the Hou&s;e was in a Committee, and had rarely u&s;ed to &s;peak in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons) ro&s;e up, and in a mo&s;t pathetical Speech, in which he excell&punc;d, endeavour'd to per|&s;wade the Hou&s;e <Q>&startq;&endq;to comply with the King's de&s;ire, for the good of the Nation, and to reconcile him to Parliaments for ever, which this &s;ea|&s;onable te&s;timony of their affections would infallibly do.</Q> He made it manife&s;t to them how very incon&s;iderable a Sum twelve Sub&s;idies amounted to, by telling them, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he had computed what he was to pay for tho&s;e twelve Sub&s;idies,</Q> and when he named the Sum, he be|ing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> known to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a great e&s;tate, it &s;eem'd not worth any far|ther Deliberation. And in the warmth of his Di&s;cour&s;e, which he plain|ly di&s;cern'd made a wonderful impre&s;&s;ion upon the Hou&s;e, he let fall &s;ome
<PB N="109" REF="1330">
&s;harp expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Impo&s;ition of Ship-money, and the Judg|ment in the point, which he &s;aid plainly <Q>&startq;&endq;was again&s;t Law, if he under|&s;tood what Law was (who was known to be very Learned) which expre&s;&s;ion,</Q> how nece&s;&s;ary and artificial &s;oever to reconcile the affections of the Hou&s;e to the matter in que&s;tion, very much irreconciled him at Court, and to Tho&s;e upon whom he had the greate&s;t dependence.</P>
<P>THERE was &s;carce ever a Speech that more gather'd up and united the inclinations of a Popular Council to the Speaker: and if the Que|&s;tion had been pre&s;ently put, it was believ'd the number of the Di&s;&s;enters <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> would not have appear'd great. But after a &s;hort &s;ilence, &s;ome men, who wi&s;h'd well to the Main, expre&s;s'd a di&s;like of the Way, &s;o that other men recover'd new courage, and call'd again with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Que&s;tion formerly propo&s;ed by M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> &s;hould be put;</Q> which &s;eem'd to meet with a concurrence. M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> then &s;tood up, <Q>and de&s;ired &startq;&endq;that Que&s;tion might not be put; &s;aid, it was a Captious que&s;tion, to which only one &s;ort of men could clearly give their Vote, which were They who were for a rejection of the King's Propo&s;ition, and no more re&s;uming the debate upon that Subject: but that They who de&s;ired to give the King a Supply, as he believ'd mo&s;t did, though not in &s;uch a <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"> Proportion, nor, it may be, in that Manner, could receive no Satis|faction by that que&s;tion; and therefore He propo&s;ed, to the end that every man might frankly give his Yea, or his No&punc; that the que&s;tion might be put only, upon the giving the King a Supply, which being carried in the Affirmative, another que&s;tion might be upon the Pro|portion, and the Manner; and if the fir&s;t were carried in the Negative, it would produce the &s;ame effect, as the other que&s;tion propo&s;ed by M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> would do.</Q></P>
<P>THIS method was receiv'd by &s;ome with great approbation, but op|po&s;ed by others with more than ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, and diverted by other <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Propo&s;itions, which being &s;econded took much time, without pointing to any Conclu&s;ion. In the end Serjeant <HI>Glanvile</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;that there had been a Que&s;tion propo&s;ed by his Country man, that agreed very well with His &s;en&s;e, and moved that the Gentleman might be call'd upon to propo&s;e it again.</Q> M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;tated the ca&s;e again as he had done, an|&s;wer'd &s;omewhat that had been &s;aid again&s;t it, and moved <Q>&startq;&endq;that Que&s;tion might be put.</Q> Whereupon for a long time there was nothing &s;aid, but a confu&s;ed clamour, and call, <HI>M</HI>^r Hambden's <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> <HI>M</HI>^r Hyde's <HI>Que|&s;tion;</HI> the call appearing much &s;tronger for the la&s;t, than the former: and it was generally believ'd that the Que&s;tion had been put, and carried <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> in the Affirmative, though it was po&s;itively oppo&s;ed by <HI>Herbert</HI> the Sol|licitor General, for what rea&s;on no man could imagine, if S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> the Secretary had not &s;tood up, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;that, as it had been all|ways his cu&s;tom to deal plainly and clearly with that Hou&s;e in all things, &s;o he could not but now a&s;&s;ure them, that the putting, and car|rying that Que&s;tion, could be of no u&s;e; for that he was mo&s;t &s;ure, and had Authority to tell them &s;o, that if they &s;hould pa&s;s a Vote for the giving the King a &s;upply, if it were not in the Proportion and Manner propo&s;ed in his Maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;age, it would not be accepted by him; and therefore de&s;ired that Que&s;tion might be laid a&s;ide;</Q> which being <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> again urged by the Sollicitor General upon the Authority of what the other had declared, and the other Privy-Coun&s;ellors &s;aying nothing, though they were much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Secretaries averment, the bu&s;ine&s;s was no more pre&s;s'd: but it being near five of the Clock in the

<P>BOTH S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and the Sollicitor General (who&s;e opinion was of more weight with the King than the others) had made a wor&s;e repre|&s;entation of the humour and affection of the Hou&s;e than it de&s;erv'd, and undertook to know, that if they came together again, they would pa&s;s &s;uch a Vote again&s;t Ship-money, as would bla&s;t that Revenue and other branches of the Receipt; which Others believ'd they would not have had the confidence to have Attempted; and very Few, that they would have had the credit to have Compa&s;s'd. What follow'd in the next Par|liament, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> within le&s;s than a year, made it believ'd, that S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> acted that part Maliciou&s;ly, and to bring all into Confu&s;ion; he being known to have an implacable hatred again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> Liev|tenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e de&s;truction was then upon the anvil. But what tran&s;ported the Sollicitor, who had none of the ends of the other, could not be imagin'd, except it was his pride, and peevi&s;hne&s;s, when he found that he was like to be of le&s;s Authority there, than he look'd to be; and yet he was heard with great attention, though his Parts were mo&s;t pre|valent in puzzling and perplexing that di&s;cour&s;e he meant to cro&s;s.

<P>THERE could not a greater damp have &s;ei&s;ed upon the Spirits of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> whole Nation, than this Di&s;&s;olution cau&s;ed; and men had much of the Mi|&s;ery in view, which &s;hortly after fell out.

<P>THERE had been in that infamous rout at <HI>Newburn</HI> two or three Officers of Quality taken Pri&s;oners, who, endeavouring to charge the Enemy with the courage they ought to do, being de&s;erted by their Troops could not avoid falling into the <HI>Scots</HI> hands; two of which were <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who was Commi&s;&s;ary-General of the Hor&s;e, and <HI>O Neal</HI> who was Major of a Regiment; both Officers of name and reputation, and of good e&s;teem in the Court with all Tho&s;e who were incen&s;ed again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> towards whom they were both very indevoted.

<P>AFTER few days the Commi&s;&s;ioners return'd to the King at <HI>York,</HI> and gave him an account of what had pa&s;s'd, and of the extraordinary affection of the <HI>Scots</HI> to his Maje&s;ty's Service; and <HI>Wilmot</HI> and <HI>O Neal</HI> magnified the good di&s;cipline and order ob&s;erv'd in the Army, and made their numbers to be believ'd much &s;uperior to what in truth they were.</P>

NOR indeed was there any man's advice of much credit with the King, but that of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> who had no rea&s;on to declare his opinion upon &s;o nice a &s;ubject in the pre&s;ence of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> and S^r <HI>Harry Vane;</HI> and thought there was only one way to be pur|&s;ued (which was not to be communicated at the Council) and that was to drive the <HI>Scots</HI> out of the Kingdom by the Army: and without con|&s;idering what was done at the Treaty (which had not yet agreed upon any Ce&s;&s;ation) he &s;ent a good Party of Hor&s;e, commanded by Major <HI>Smith,</HI> to fall upon a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Quarter in the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> defeated two or three of their Troops and took all their Officers Pri|&s;oners, and made it manife&s;t enough that the Kingdom might be rid of the re&s;t, if it were vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued; which the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> heartily intended.

<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> THE King begun &s;o far to di&s;like the temper of his Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he thought the Parliament would be more jealous of his Honour, and more &s;en&s;ible of the Indignities he &s;uffer'd by the <HI>Scots,</HI> than the Commi&s;&s;ioners appear'd to be; and therefore he &s;ent them back to <HI>Rip|pon</HI> again to renew the Treaty, and to conclude a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms upon as good terms as they could; &s;o that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army might not ad|vance into <HI>York&s;htre,</HI> nor enlarge their Quarters any way beyond what they were already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of: and this conce&s;&s;ion being agreed to, they &s;hould not enter upon any other particulars, but adjourn the Treaty to <HI>London;</HI> which was the only thing the <HI>Scots</HI> de&s;ired, and without <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> This they could never have brought their de&s;igns to pa&s;s.

But in both the&s;e applications he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> underwent great mortifications; the Officers of the Army every day asking his leave to repair to <HI>London,</HI> being cho&s;en to &s;erve in Parlia|ment; and when he denied to give them Pa&s;&s;es, they went away with|out them: and the Gentlemen of the Country who had mo&s;t depended upon him, and been obliged by him, withdrawing their application and attendance, and entring into combination with his greate&s;t Enemies again&s;t him.</P>
<P>IT is not to be denied, the King was in very great Straits, and had it not in his power ab&s;olutely to choo&s;e which way he would go; and well fore&s;aw, that a Parliament in that conjuncture of affairs would not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> apply natural and proper Remedies to the Di&s;ea&s;e: for though it was not imaginable it would run the cour&s;es it afterwards did, yet it was $word$ enough he mu&s;t re&s;ign very much to their affections and appe|tite (which were not like to be contain&punc;d within any mode&s;t bounds) and therefore no que&s;tion his Maje&s;ty did not think of calling a Parlia|ment at fir&s;t, but was wrought to it by degrees: Yet the great Coun|cil could not but produce the other; where the unskilfulne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ome for want of di&s;cerning Con&s;equences, and a general &s;harpne&s;s and animo&s;ity again&s;t Per&s;ons, did more mi&s;chief than the power or ma|lice of Tho&s;e who had a form'd de&s;ign of Confu&s;ion: for without doubt <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that Fire at that time (which did &s;hortly after burn the whole King|dom) might have been cover'd under a bu&s;hel. So as intruth there was no Coun&s;el &s;o nece&s;&s;ary then, as for the King to have continued in his Army, and to have drawn none thither but &s;uch as were more afraid of di&s;honour than danger; and to have tru&s;ted the ju&s;tice and power of the Law with &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Tumults, and quieting Di&s;orders in his rear.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange, and had &s;omewhat of a Judgment from Heaven in it, that all the indu&s;try and learning of the late years had been be&s;tow'd in finding out and evincing, that in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity any extraordinary <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> way for Supply was Lawful; and upon that ground had proceeded when there was No nece&s;&s;ity; and now when the Nece&s;&s;ity was appa|rent, Money mu&s;t be levied in the ordinary cour&s;e of Parliament, which was then more extraordinary than the other had been; as <HI>York</HI> mu&s;t be defended from an Enemy within twenty five miles of it, by Money to be given at <HI>London</HI> &s;ix Weeks after, and to be gather'd within &s;ix Months.

BuT the King was without the pre&s;ence and attendance of any man in who&s;e judgment and wi&s;dom he had a full confidence; for the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was at the Army; and they who fir&s;t propo&s;ed the call|ing the Peers, knew well enough that the King knew Parliaments too well to be inclined to call one if they &s;hould propo&s;e it; and there|fore They propo&s;ed another expedient, which he knew not; and &s;o was &s;urprized with the advice (which he thought could do no harm) and gave direction for the i&s;&s;uing out of the Writs, before he enough con&s;i|der'd whether it might not intruth produce &s;ome mi&s;chief he had not well thought of; as he quickly found. Nor did the <HI>Scots</HI> them&s;elves re|&s;olve <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to give him more di&s;quiet in the en&s;uing Parliament, than the major part of his great Council that he brought together re&s;olv'd to con|cur with them in: and with that di&s;po&s;ition, which they could never have contracted if they had remain'd by them&s;elves, they all ha&s;ten'd to the place where they might do the Mi&s;chief they intended.</P>
<P>THE next Error to this was, that at the meeting of the great Coun|cil at <HI>York,</HI> and before any con&s;ent to the Treaty at <HI>Rippon,</HI> there was not a &s;tate made, and information given of the whole Proceedings in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thereupon &s;ome debate and judgment by the whole Coun|cil before the Sixteen departed, for their information and in&s;truction: <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and this had been &s;trangely omitted before at the Pacification, in&s;o|much as many who had been employ'd in that fir&s;t at <HI>the Berkes,</HI> and in the la&s;t at <HI>Rippon,</HI> confe&s;s'd that none of them (and they were of the Prime Quality) then did, or ever after, know any thing of the Laws and Cu&s;toms of that Kingdom (by which they might have judged whe|ther the King had exceeded his ju&s;t power, or any thing of the mat|ter of fact in the &s;everal tran&s;actions) but what they had receiv'd at tho&s;e meetings from the per&s;ons who were naturally to make their own defence, and &s;o by accu&s;ing others to make their own ca&s;e the more plau&s;ible; in which it could not be expected they would mention any+thing <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to their own di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>BY Them they weretold <Q>&startq;&endq;of a Liturgy impo&s;ed upon them by their Bi&s;hops, contrary to, or without Act of Parliament, with &s;trange cir|cum&s;tances of Severity and Rigour: of &s;ome clau&s;es in that Liturgy, different from that of the Church of <HI>England,</HI></Q> with pretty &s;mart com|ments of advice, and animadver&s;ions upon tho&s;e Alterations: <Q>&startq;&endq;of a Book of Canons, in which an extraordinary and extravagant power was a&s;&s;erted to the Bi&s;hops: of a High Commi&s;&s;ion Court, which ex|ceeded all limits, and cen&s;ured all degrees of men: of the in&s;olent Speeches of this Bi&s;hop to that Nobleman, and of the Ill Life of ano+ther: <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of their Own great Humility and Duty to their &s;acred Sovereign, without who&s;e Favour and Protection they would not live:</Q> and la&s;t|ly, <Q>&startq;&endq;of their &s;everal mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;s Addre&s;&s;es, by Petition and all other ways to his Maje&s;ty; being de&s;irous, when their Grievances were but heard, to lay Them&s;elves and their Complaints at his Royal Feet, and to be mo&s;t entirely di&s;po&s;ed by him in &s;uch manner, as to His wi&s;|dom alone &s;hould be thought fit: but that by the power and inter|po&s;ition of their Adver&s;aries, all their Supplications had been rejected, and They never yet admitted to be heard.</Q></P>
<P>WITH the&s;e and the like Artifices the good Lords were &s;o wrought upon, and tran&s;ported, that they ea&s;ily Con&s;ented to what&s;oever was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> propo&s;ed: nor was there any Propo&s;ition made and in&s;i&s;ted on by them at the fir&s;t or &s;econd Treaty, which was not for the matter fully Con|&s;ented
<PB N="129" REF="1530">
to: whereas, if their Lord&s;hips had been fully adverti&s;ed of the whole truth (though there had been &s;ome Inadvertencies and Inco|gitancy in the circum&s;tances of the tran&s;action) his Maje&s;ty had full power, by the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> then in force, to make that Reformation he intended. All their Petitions and Addre&s;&s;es had found mo&s;t gracious acceptance, and receiv'd mo&s;t gracious an&s;wers. But on the contrary, They had invaded all the Rights of the Crown, alter'd the Government, affronted the Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, and his Maje&s;ty's own Regal Authority, with unheard of In&s;olences and Contempts; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> rejected all his offers of Grace and Pardon, and without cau&s;e or provo|cation denounced War again&s;t him; be&s;ieged and taken the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and other Places which held for his Maje&s;ty. I &s;ay, if This had been made as evident to them as &s;urely it might have been made, it is not po&s;&s;ible but tho&s;e Noble per&s;ons would have pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves from being deluded by them; at lea&s;t many of the Inconve|niences which after en&s;ued would have been prevented, if the form and method of their Proceedings had been pre&s;cribed, or better look'd into.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that in that conjuncture &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Evi|dence <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and Information could very hardly be given: for though it mu&s;t not be doubted that there were many particular Per&s;ons of Honour of that Nation who abhor'd the Outrages which were committed, and retain'd within their own brea&s;ts very Loyal wi&s;hes for his Maje&s;ty's Pro&s;perity; yet it cannot be denied that tho&s;e per&s;ons, who by the Places they held (of King's Advocate, and other Offices) ought to have made that Information of matter of Law, and matter of Fact, were Them&s;elves the mo&s;t active Promoters of the Rebellion; and the Defe|ction was &s;o general, and &s;o few declared, or were active on his Ma|je&s;ty's behalf, that they who were not corrupted in their inward Fidelity, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> were &s;o Terrified, that they dur&s;t not appear in any Office that might provoke Tho&s;e who &s;olely had the power and the will to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t and mo&s;t confounding Error was the removing the Trea|ty to <HI>London,</HI> and upon any terms con&s;enting that the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;hould re&s;ide there before a Peace concluded. By which means, they had not only opportunity to publi&s;h all their Coun&s;els and Dire|ctions in their Sermons to the People (who re&s;orted thither in incredible numbers) and to give their Advice, from time to time, to Tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who knew not &s;o well yet to compa&s;s their Own ends, but <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> were ready (when any bu&s;ine&s;s was too big and unweildy to be managed by the few who were yet throughly engaged) to interpo&s;e in the name of Their Nation, and with reference to Things or Per&s;ons to make &s;uch demands from and on the behalf of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as under no other &s;tyle would have receiv'd any countenance: and this brought that univer&s;al Terror with it (as will appear to the life in the proce&s;s of this Hi&s;tory) upon Tho&s;e of neare&s;t relation to the King's Ser|vice, as well as Tho&s;e at a greater di&s;tance, who clearly di&s;cern'd and dete&s;ted the Villany and Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, that their warine&s;s and wi&s;dom could not be great enough to pre&s;erve them, if they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> did not &s;tupidly look on without &s;eeming to under&s;tand what they could in no degree controul or prevent.</P>
<P>IN all Con&s;piracies there mu&s;t be great &s;ecrecy, con&s;ent, and union; yet it can hardly be conceiv'd, with what entire Confidence in each
<PB N="130" REF="1540">
other, the numerous and not very rich Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> (for of the Common People, who are naturally very dependent on the other, there can be no wonder) concurr'd in the carrying on this Rebellion: their &s;trange Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Submi&s;&s;ion to their ignorant and in&s;o|lent Clergy, who were to have great Authority becau&s;e they were to inflame all &s;orts of men upon the obligations of Con&s;cience; and in or|der thereunto, and to revenge a little Indi&s;cretion and Ill Manners of &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, had liberty to erect a Tribunal the mo&s;t Ty|rannical over all &s;orts of men, and all the Families of the Kingdom: &s;o that the Preacher reprehended the Husband, govern'd the Wife, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> cha&s;ti&s;ed the Children, and in&s;ulted over the Servants, in the Hou&s;es of the Greate&s;t men. They refer'd the management and conduct of the whole Affair to a Committee of a few, who had never before exerci&s;ed any Office or Authority in the Publick, with that perfect re&s;ignation and obedience, that nobody pre&s;umed to enquire What was to be done, or to murmur at, or cen&s;ure any thing that Was done; and the Ge|neral him&s;elf, and the Martial affairs, were &s;ubject to this <HI>Regimen</HI> and Di&s;cipline as well as the Civil: yet They who were intru&s;ted with this Superiority, paid all the Outward re&s;pect and reverence to the per&s;on of the General, as if all the power and di&s;po&s;al had been in Him <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> alone.</P>
<P>THE few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (for there were yet but very few who were in|tru&s;ted from the Beginning of the enterprize, and with all that was Then projected) were men of re&s;erv'd and dark natures, of great indu|&s;try and addre&s;s, and of much reputation for probity and integrity of life, and who tru&s;ted none, but tho&s;e who were contented to be tru&s;ted to that degree as they were willing to tru&s;t them, without being in|qui&s;itive into more than they were ready to communicate, and for the re&s;t depended upon their di&s;cretion and judgment; and &s;o prepared and di&s;po&s;ed, by &s;econd and third hands, many to concur and contri|bute <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to &s;everal preparatory actions, who would never have con|&s;ented to the conclu&s;ions which naturally re&s;ulted from tho&s;e pre|mi&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS united &s;trength, and humble and active temper, was not en|counter'd by an equal providence and circum&s;pection in the King's Councils, or an equal temper and dutiful di&s;po&s;ition in the Court; nor did they who re&s;olv'd hone&s;tly and &s;toutly to di&s;charge the offices of good Servants and good Subjects to the utmo&s;t oppo&s;ition of all un|lawful attempts, communicate their purpo&s;es to men of the &s;ame Inte|grity, that &s;o they might unite their coun&s;els as well in the manner <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and way, as their re&s;olutions in the end. But every one thought it enough to pre&s;erve his own innocence, and to leave the Re&s;t to tho&s;e who &s;hould have authority to direct. The King was perplex'd and irre&s;o|lute, and according to his natural con&s;titution (which never di&s;po&s;ed him to jealou&s;y of any man of whom he had once thought well) was full of hope, that his condition was not &s;o bad as it &s;eem'd to be. The Queen wi&s;h'd much better to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> than to the Arch-Bi&s;hop or the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> neither of Them being in any de|gree acceptable to her; &s;o that &s;he was little concern'd for the dan|ger that threatned them: but when &s;he &s;aw the King's Honour and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Dignity invaded in the pro&s;ecution, &s;he withdrew her favour from the Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> but then &s;he was per&s;waded, by tho&s;e who had mo&s;t credit with her, to believe, that by the removal of the great
<PB N="131" REF="1550">
Mini&s;ters, Her power and authority would be encrea&s;ed, and that the prevailing Party would be willing to depend upon her; and that by gratifying the principal Per&s;ons of them with &s;uch Prefer|ments as they affected, &s;he would quickly reconcile all ill humours: and &s;o &s;he hearkned to any overtures of that kind; which were allways carried on without the con&s;ent or privity of tho&s;e who were con|cern'd, who intruth more di&s;liked Her ab&s;olute power with the King, than any other Exce&s;s of the Court, and look'd upon it as the greate&s;t Grievance. Every man There con&s;ider'd only what application would <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> be mo&s;t like to rai&s;e his Own fortune, or to do Tho&s;e harm with whom he was angry, and gave him&s;elf wholely up to tho&s;e Artifices which might promote either. To pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the di&s;plea|&s;ure and cen&s;ure of the Parliament, and to render them&s;elves gracious to Tho&s;e who were like to be powerful in it, was all men's bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ollicitude. And in this very unequal and di&s;proportion'd condition and temper, was the King's and the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army, the Court and the Country, when the Parliament met.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment met <HI>November</HI> the Third <HI>1640.</HI></NOTE> _THE Parliament met upon the Third of <HI>No|vember</HI> 1640, with a fuller appearance than could be rea&s;onably expected, from the &s;hort time for Elections after the i&s;&s;uing out the Writs; in&s;omuch as at the fir&s;t not many Members were ab&s;ent. It had a &s;ad and a malancholick a&s;pect upon the fir&s;t entrance, which pre&s;aged &s;ome unu&s;ual and unnatural events. The King him&s;elf did not ride with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> his accu&s;tom d Equipage nor in his u&s;ual ma|je&s;ty to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but went privately in his Barge to the Parliament Stairs, and after to the Church, as if it had been to a return of a pro|rogued or adjourn'd Parliament. And there was likewi&s;e an untoward, and intruth an unheard of accident, which broke many of the King's mea&s;ures, and infinitely di&s;order'd his Service beyond a capacity of repa|ration. From the time the calling a Parliament was re&s;olv'd upon, the King de&s;ign'd S^r <HI>Thomas Gardiner,</HI> who was Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> to be Speaker in the Hou&s;e of Commons; a man of gravity and quickne&s;s, that had &s;omewhat of authority and gracefulne&s;s in his per&s;on and pre|&s;ence, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and in all re&s;pects equal to the Service. There was little doubt but that he would be cho&s;en to &s;erve in one of the four places for the City of <HI>London,</HI> which had very rarely rejected their Recorder upon that occa&s;ion; and le&s;t that &s;hould fail, diligence was u&s;ed in one or two other places that he might be elected. The oppo&s;ition was &s;o great, and the Faction &s;o &s;trong, to hinder his being elected in the City, that four
<PB N="136" REF="1580">
others were cho&s;en for that Service, without hardly mentioning his name: nor was there le&s;s indu&s;try u&s;ed to prevent his being cho&s;en in other places; Clerks were corrupted not to make out the Writ for one place, and ways were found out to hinder the Writ from being executed in another, time enough for the return before the meeting: &s;o great a fear there was, that a man of entire affections to the King, and of prudence enough to manage tho&s;e affections, and to regulate the contrary, &s;hould be put into the Chair. So that the very morning the Parliament was to meet, and when the King intended to go thither, he was inform'd that S^r <HI>Thomas Gardiner</HI> was not return'd to &s;erve as a Member in the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;o was not capable of being cho&s;en to be Speaker; &s;o that his Maje&s;ty deferr'd his going to the Hou&s;e till the afternoon, by which time he was to think of another Speaker.</P>
<P>UPON the peru&s;al of all the Returns into the Crown Office, there were not found many Lawyers of eminent Name (though many of them proved very Eminent men afterwards) or who had &s;erv'd long in former Parliaments, the experience whereof was to be wi&s;h'd; and men of that Profe&s;&s;ion had been mo&s;t commonly thought the mo&s;t proper for that Service, and the putting it out of that Channel at that time was thought too hazardous: &s;o that, after all the deliberation the &s;hortne&s;s <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of that time would admit, M^r <HI>Lenthall,</HI> a Bencher of <HI>Lincolns</HI>-Inn (a Lawyer of competent practice, and no ill reputation for his affection to the Government both of Church and State) was pitch'd upon by the King, and with very great difficulty rather prevail'd with than per|&s;waded to accept the charge. And no doubt a Wor&s;e could not have been deputed of all that Profe&s;&s;ion who were then return'd; for he was a man of a very narrow, timorous nature, and of no experience or conver|&s;ation in the affairs of the Kingdom, beyond what the very drudgery in his Profe&s;&s;ion (in which all his de&s;ign was to make him&s;elf rich) en|gaged him in. In a word, he was in all re&s;pects very unequal to the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Work, and not knowing how to pre&s;erve his Own dignity, or to re&s;train the licence and exorbitance of Others, his Weakne&s;s contributed as much to the growing Mi&s;chiefs, as the Malice of the principal contrivers. However, after the King had that afternoon recommended the di&s;tracted condition of the Kingdom (with too little Maje&s;ty) to the wi&s;dom of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, to have &s;uch reformation and remedies ap|plied as They &s;hould think fit, propo&s;ing to them, as the be&s;t rule for their Coun&s;els, <Q>&startq;&endq;that all things &s;hould be reduced to the practice of the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI></Q> the Hou&s;e of Commons no &s;ooner return'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">M^$ <HI>Lenthall</HI> $word$ Speaker.</NOTE> to their Hou&s;e, than they cho&s;e M^r <HI>Lenthall</HI> to be their Speaker; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> two days after, with the u&s;ual ceremonies and circum&s;tances, pre&s;ented him to the King, who declared his acceptation; and &s;o both Hou&s;es were ready for the Work.</P>
<P>THERE was ob&s;erv'd a marvellous elated countenance in many of the Members of Parliament before they met together in the Hou&s;e; the &s;ame men who &s;ix months before were ob&s;erv'd to be of very moderate tempers, and to wi&s;h that gentle remedies might be applied, without opening the wound too wide and expo&s;ing it to the air, and rather to cure what was ami&s;s than too &s;trictly to make inqui&s;ition into the cau&s;es and original of the malady, talk'd Now in another dialect both of Things <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and Per&s;ons; and &s;aid <Q>&startq;&endq;that they mu&s;t now be of another temper than they were the la&s;t Parliament; that they mu&s;t not only &s;weep the Hou&s;e clean below, but mu&s;t pull down all the Cobwebs which hung

<P>BY this means (contrary to the Cu&s;toms and Rights of Parliament) many Gentlemen of good Quality were removed, in who&s;e places com|monly others were cho&s;en of more agreeable di&s;po&s;itions: but in this likewi&s;e there was no rule ob&s;erv'd; for no per&s;on was hereby removed, of whom there was any hope that he might be applied to the violent cour&s;es which were intended.

<P>I REMEMBER one Story brought into the Hou&s;e concerning him, that admini&s;tred &s;ome mirth; A Me&s;&s;enger (I think his name was <HI>New|ton)</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> who principally attended the &s;ervice of apprehending Prie&s;ts, came one day to him in his Garden, and told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he had brought with him a Prie&s;t, a &s;tirring and active per&s;on, whom he had appre|hended
<PB N="143" REF="1650">
that morning; and de&s;ired to know, to what Pri&s;on he &s;hould carry him.</Q> The Secretary &s;harply ask'd him, <Q>&startq;&endq;Whether he would never give over this Blood-thir&s;ty humour?</Q> and in great anger calling him Knave, and taking the Warrant from him by which he had ap|prehended him, departed without giving any other direction. The Me&s;|&s;enger appall'd, thought the Prie&s;t was &s;ome per&s;on in favour, and therefore took no more care of him, but &s;uffer'd him to depart. The Prie&s;t, freed from this fright, went &s;ecurely to his Lodgings, and within two or three days was arre&s;ted for Debt, and carried in execution to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Pri&s;on. Shortly after, Secretary <HI>Windebank</HI> &s;ent for the Me&s;&s;enger, and ask'd him, <Q>&startq;&endq;What was become of the Prie&s;t he had at &s;uch a time brought before him? he told him, "that he conceived his Honour had been offended with the apprehen&s;ion of him, and therefore he had look'd no farther after him.</Q> The Secretary in much Pa&s;&s;ion told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;the di&s;charging a Prie&s;t was no light matter, and that if he &s;pee|dily found him not, he &s;hould an&s;wer the default with his life; that the Prie&s;t was a dangerous Fellow, and mu&s;t not e&s;cape in that fa|&s;hion.</Q> The Me&s;&s;enger, be&s;ides his natural inclination to that exerci&s;e, terrified with tho&s;e threats, left no means untried for the di&s;covery, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and at la&s;t heard where the man was in execution in Pri&s;on: thither he went and demanded the Prie&s;t (who was not there known to be &s;uch) as his Pri&s;oner formerly, and e&s;caped from him; and by virtue of his fir&s;t Warrant took him again into his cu&s;tody, and immediately carried him to the Secretary; and within few days after, the Prie&s;t was di&s;|charged, and at liberty. The Jaylor, in who&s;e cu&s;tody he had been put for debt, was arre&s;ted by the Parties griev'd, and he again &s;ued the Me&s;|&s;enger, who appeal'd for Ju&s;tice to the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Secretary.</P>
<P>THIS Ca&s;e had been pre&s;ented to the Committee, and was ready to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> be reported, with all tho&s;e Warrants under his own hand before men|tion'd, at the time when Secretary <HI>Windebank</HI> was in the Hou&s;e.

<P>BuT the calling and admitting men to that Board is not a work that can be indifferent: the Reputation, if not the Government of the State depending on it. And though, it may be, there hath been too much Cu|rio&s;ity heretofore u&s;ed to di&s;cover men's humours in particular points, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> before they have receiv'd that Honour; whereas po&s;&s;ibly &s;uch differences were rather to have been de&s;ired than avoided: yet there are certain Opinions, certain Propo&s;itions, and general Principles, that Who&s;oever does not hold, and does not believe, is not, without great danger, to be accepted for a Privy-Coun&s;ellor. As, Who&s;oever is not fix'd to Monar|chical grounds, the pre&s;ervation and upholding whereof is the chief End of &s;uch a Council: Who&s;oever doth not believe that in order to that great End, there is a Dignity, a Freedom, a Juri&s;diction mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to be pre&s;erv'd In, and To that place; and takes not the Pre&s;ervation there|of to heart; ought never to be receiv'd there. What in prudence is to be <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> done towards that End, admits a latitude that hone&s;t and wi&s;e men may &s;afely and profitably differ in; and tho&s;e Differences (which I &s;aid before there was too much unskilful care to prevent) u&s;ually produce great advantages in knowledge and wi&s;dom: but the End it &s;elf, that which the Logicians call the <HI>Terminus ad quem,</HI> ought allways to be a <HI>po&s;tulatum,</HI> which Who&s;oever doubts, de&s;troys: and Princes cannot be too &s;trict, too tender, in this con&s;ideration, in the con&s;tituting the body of their Privy-Council; upon the Prudent doing whereof, much of their Safety; more of their Honour and Reputation (which is the Life it &s;elf of Princes) both at home and abroad nece&s;&s;arily depends: and the In|advertencies <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> in this Point, have been, mediately or immediately, the Root and the Spring of mo&s;t of the Calamities that have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>TWO Rea&s;ons have been frequently given by Princes for Over&s;ights, or for Willful Breaches, in this important di&s;pen&s;ation of their Favours.

The fir&s;t, "that &s;uch a man can do no harm; when, God knows, few men have done more harm than Tho&s;e who have been thought to be able to do lea&s;t; and there cannot be a greater error than to believe, a man whom we &s;ee qualified with too mean parts to do good, to be therefore incapable of doing hurt: there is a &s;upply of Malice, of Pride, of Indu|&s;try&punc; and even of Folly, in the Weake&s;t, when He &s;ets his heart upon it, that makes a &s;trange progre&s;s in Mi&s;chief.

<P>THE truth is, the &s;inking and near de&s;perate condition of Monar|chy in this Kingdom can never be buoy'd up, but by a prudent and &s;tea|dy <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Council attending upon the virtue and vivacity of the King; nor be pre&s;erv'd and improved when it is up, but by cheri&s;hing and pre&s;erving the wi&s;dom, integrity, dignity, and reputation, of that Council: the lu&s;tre whereof allways reflects upon the King him&s;elf; who is not thought a Great Monarch when he follows only his Own Rea&s;on and Ap|petite; but when, for the informing his Rea&s;on, and guiding his Actions, he u&s;es the &s;ervice, indu&s;try, and faculties, of the Wi&s;e&s;t men.

<P>THIS Digre&s;&s;ion &punc;much longer than was intended) will not appear very impertinent, when the great di&s;&s;ervice &s;hall appear, which befell the King by the &s;wearing tho&s;e Lords formerly mention'd (I &s;peak but of &s;ome of them) Privy-Coun&s;ellors.

And therefore when the King required the Advice of his Privy&punc;Council, in tho&s;e mat|ters
<PB N="157" REF="1790">
of the highe&s;t importance which were then every day incumbent on Him, the new Privy-Coun&s;ellors po&s;itively declared, <Q>&startq;&endq;that They might not (that was, that nobody might) give his Maje&s;ty any advice in matters depending in the two Hou&s;es, which was not agreeable to the &s;en&s;e of the two Hou&s;es; which They call'd his Great Council, by Who&s;e wi&s;dom he was entirely to guide him&s;elf.</Q> As this doctrine was in&s;ipid|ly and perniciou&s;ly urged by &s;ome; &s;o it was &s;upinely and &s;tupidly &s;ub|mitted to by others: in&s;omuch as the King, in a moment found him|&s;elf bereav'd of all Publick a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice, in a time when he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> needed it mo&s;t; and his greate&s;t, and, upon the matter, his only bu&s;ine&s;s, being prudently to weigh and con&s;ider What to Con&s;ent to, and What to Deny, of &s;uch things as &s;hould be Propo&s;ed to him by the two Hou&s;es: He was now told, "that He was only to be Advi&s;ed by Them; which was as much as to &s;ay, that He mu&s;t do what&s;oever They de&s;ired of him.</P>
<P>WHEREAS in truth, it is not only Lawful for the Privy-Council, but their Duty, to give faithfully and freely Their advice to the King upon all matters concluded in Parliament, to which his Royal a&s;&s;ent is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as well as upon any other &s;ubject what&s;oever.

And therefore, by the con&s;titution of the Kingdom, and the con&s;tant practice of Former times, all Bills after they had pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es, were deliver'd by the Clerk of the Parliament to the Clerk of the Crown; and by him brought to the Atturney General; who pre|&s;ented the &s;ame to the king &s;itting in Council; and having read them, declared what Alterations were made by tho&s;e Bills to former Laws; and what Benefit or Detriment, in Profit or Juri&s;diction, would accrew <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> thereby to the Crown: and then upon a full and free debate by his Coun|&s;ellors, the King re&s;olv'd accordingly upon &s;uch Bills as were to be enacted into Laws; and re&s;pited the other that he thought not fit to con|&s;ent to. As this hath been the known Practice, &s;o the Rea&s;on is very vi|&s;ible; that the Royal A&s;&s;ent being a di&s;tinct and e&s;&s;ential part towards the making a Law, there &s;hould be as much care taken to inform the Under&s;tanding and Con&s;cience of the King upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions; as Theirs, who prepare the &s;ame for his Royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>

<P>THE Fir&s;t, not unlearn&punc;d in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Law, as far as Learning is acquired by the meer reading of Books; but being a per&s;on of great Indu&s;try, had &s;pent more time in reading Divinity; and which marr'd that Divinity, in the conver&s;ation of Factious and Hot-headed Divines: and &s;o, by a mixture of all three, with the rudene&s;s and arro|gance of his Own nature, had contracted a Proud and Venemous Di&s;like <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to the di&s;cipline of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and &s;o by degrees (as the Progre&s;s is very natural) an equal Irreverence to the Government of the State too; both which he vented in &s;everal ab&s;urd, petulant, and &s;u|percilious Di&s;cour&s;es in Print.</P>
<P>THE Second, a half-witted, crackbrain'd Fellow, unknown to either Univer&s;ity, or the College of Phy&s;icians; but one that had &s;pent his time abroad, between the Schools and the Camp (for he had been in, or pa&s;s'd through Armies) and had gotten a Doctor&s;hip, and Latin; with which, in a very flowing &s;tyle, with &s;ome wit and much malice, he In|veigh'd again&s;t the Prelates of the Church in a Book which he printed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>London,</HI> and throughout the Kingdom; having pre&s;umed (as their Mode&s;ty is all ways equal to their Obedience) to Dedicate it <HI>to the Sacred Maje&s;ty of the King.</HI></P>

<P>SHORTLY upon that, Petitions were pre&s;ented by their Wives or Friends, to the Hou&s;e of Commons, expre&s;&s;ing <Q>&startq;&endq;their heavy Cen&s;ures and long &s;ufferings; and de&s;iring, by way of Appeal, "that the ju&s;tice and rigour of that Sentence might be review'd and con&s;ider'd; and that their Per&s;ons might be brought from tho&s;e remote and de&s;olate places to <HI>London,</HI> that &s;o they might be able to facilitate or attend their own bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q> The &s;ending for them out of Pri&s;on (which was the main) took up much con&s;ideration: for though very Many who had no kind|ne&s;s, had yet compa&s;&s;ion for the men; thinking they had &s;uffer'd enough; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and that though they were &s;curvy Fellows, they had been &s;curvily u&s;ed: and Others, had not only affection to their Per&s;ons as having &s;uf|fer'd for a Common cau&s;e; but were concern'd to revive and improve their u&s;eful faculties of Libelling and reviling Authority; and to make tho&s;e ebullitions of their malice not thought noi&s;om to the State: Yet a Sentence of a &s;upreme Court, the Star-chamber (of which they had not Yet &s;poke with Irreverence) was not lightly to be blown off: but, when they were inform'd, and had con&s;ider'd, that by that Sentence the Pe|titioners were condemn'd to &s;ome Pri&s;ons in <HI>London;</HI> and were after|ward removed thence by an Order of the Lords of the Council; they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> look'd upon that Order as a violation of the Sentence: and &s;o made no &s;cruple to order <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Pri&s;oners &s;hould be removed from tho&s;e for|reign Pri&s;ons,</Q> to the Places to which they were regularly fir&s;t commit|ted.

Governours and Captains of the &s;everal Ca&s;tles, <Q>&startq;&endq;to bring them in &s;afe cu&s;tody to <HI>London:</HI></Q> which were &s;ent with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>PRYN and <HI>Burton</HI> being Neighbours (though in di&s;tinct I&s;lands) landed at the &s;ame time at <HI>Southampton;</HI> where they were receiv'd and entertain'd with extraordinary demon&s;trations of Affection and E&s;teem; attended by a marvellous conflux of Company; and their Charges not only born with great magnificence, but liberal Pre&s;ents given to them. And this method and ceremony kept them company all their journey, great herds of People meeting them at their entrance into all Towns, and waiting upon them out with wonderful acclamations of joy. When <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> they came near <HI>London,</HI> multitudes of People of &s;everal conditions, &s;ome on Hor&s;eback, others on Foot, met them &s;ome miles from the Town; very many having been a days journey: and they were brought, about two of the Clock in the afternoon, in at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s,</HI> and carried into the City by above ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, with Boughs and Flow|ers in their hands; the Common People &s;trewing Flowers and Herbs in the ways as they pa&s;s'd, making great noi&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ions of joy for their Deliverance and Return; and in tho&s;e acclamations, mingling loud and virulent exclamations again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, <Q>&startq;&endq;who had &s;o cruel|ly pro&s;ecuted &s;uch Godly men.</Q> In the &s;ame manner, within five or &s;ix <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> days after, and in like Triumph, D^r <HI>Ba&s;twick</HI> return'd from <HI>Silley;</HI> land|ing at <HI>Dover:</HI> and from thence bringing the &s;ame te&s;timonies of the Affections and Zeal of <HI>Kent,</HI> as the others had done from <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> was met before he came to <HI>Southwark</HI> by the good People of <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o conducted to his lodging likewi&s;e in the City.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have wa&s;ted thus much time in a di&s;cour&s;e of this nature, but that it Is, and was Then evident, that this In&s;urrection (for it was no better) and Frenzy of the People, was an effect of great Indu|&s;try and Policy, to try and publi&s;h the Temper of the People; and to &s;a|tisfy Them&s;elves, in the activity and intere&s;t of their Tribunes, to whom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that province of Shewing them was committed. And from this time, the licence of Preaching and Printing increa&s;ed; to that degree, that all Pulpits were freely deliver'd to the Schi&s;matical and Silenced Preach|ers, who till then had lurk'd in corners, or liv'd in <HI>New-England;</HI> and the Pre&s;&s;es at liberty for the publi&s;hing the mo&s;t Invective, Seditious, and Scurrilous Pamphlets, that their Wit and Malice could invent. Whil&s;t the Mini&s;ters of the State, and Judges of the Law, like men in an Exta&s;y, &s;urprized and amazed with &s;everal Apparitions, had no Speech or Motion; as if, having committed &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Juri&s;diction (as men upon great Surfeits are enjoin'd for a time to eat nothing) they had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> been pre&s;cribed to exerci&s;e no Juri&s;diction at all. Whereas, without doubt, if either the Privy-Council, or the Judges and the King's learned Council, had a&s;&s;umed the courage to have Que&s;tion'd the Preaching, or the Printing, or the Seditious Riots upon the Triumph of tho&s;e three Scandalous men, before the uninterruption and &s;ecurity had confirm'd the People in all three; it had been no hard matter to have de&s;troy'd tho&s;e Seeds, and pull'd up tho&s;e Plants, which being neglected, grew up and pro&s;per'd to a full Harve&s;t of Rebellion and Trea&s;on. But this was yet but a rudene&s;s and rankne&s;s Abroad, without any vi&s;ible countenance or approbation from the Parliament: all &s;eem'd Cha&s;t within tho&s;e Walls. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"></P>

<P>ALL the Judges of <HI>England,</HI> upon mature debate, in the pre&s;ence of the King's Council, under their Hands a&s;&s;erted, <Q>&startq;&endq;the Power of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Convocation in making Canons, and tho&s;e other parts of Juri&s;diction, which had been &s;o Enviou&s;ly que&s;tion'd.</Q> Hercupon, They proceeded; and having compo&s;ed a Body of Canons, pre&s;ented the &s;ame to his Maje&s;ty, for his Royal Approbation.

<P>YET the Storm fell wholely on the Church: and the Matter of tho&s;e Canons, and the Manner of making them, was in&s;i&s;ted on, as a pregnant te&s;timony of a Malignant Spirit in the very Function of the Bi&s;hops.

<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> THIS Expedient &s;ucceeded twice or thrice for &s;uch Sums as They thought fit to require; which were only enough to carry on their affairs, and keep them in motion; not proportionable to di&s;charge the Debt due to the Armies, but to enable them to Pay their Quarters: it being fit to keep a con&s;iderable Debt &s;till owing, le&s;t they &s;hould appear too ready to be disbanded.</P>

<P>FOR the Earl's demand, <Q>&startq;&endq;of an Order to Examine &s;ome Members on his behalf,</Q> upon matters of fact, at his Trial; after a long Debate, they left it only in the Power of the Per&s;ons Them&s;elves who were no|minated, "to be Examin'd if they would (not without &s;ome &s;mart Animadver&s;ions, "that they &s;hould take heed What they did) and re|&s;u&s;ed to Enjoin them; though the &s;ame had been done at Their de&s;ire, for the Lords of the Council: but that was Again&s;t the Earl, and &s;o the Le&s;s to be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>THE Lords, in the ab&s;ence of the Lord Keeper, who was very Sick, made choice of the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> to Pre&s;ide and Govern the Court; being a per&s;on notoriou&s;ly Di&s;affected to the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></P>
<P>AND for the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the Bi&s;hops, they were &s;aved the labour of giving any Rule (which it may be would have troubled them) by <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s &s;tanding up, and moving, on the behalf of Him|&s;elf and his Brethren, <Q>&startq;&endq;that They might be Excu&s;ed from being pre&s;ent at the Trial, being Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, and &s;o not to have Their hands in Blood;</Q> and &s;uch other Rea&s;ons, as, when they are examin'd, will not be found of very great weight.</P>
<P>THIS Bi&s;hop had been, by &s;everal Cen&s;ures in the Star-chamber, Im|pri&s;on'd in the Tower, where he remain'd till after the beginning of this Parliament, and was then &s;et at Liberty upon the de&s;ire of the Lords; who knew him to be a mortal and irreconcileable Enemy to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> and indeed, he had allways been a Puritan &s;o <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> far as to love None of the Bi&s;hops, and to have u&s;ed Many learned Church&punc;men with great Contempt and In&s;olence: and yet he left no way unpracti&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would do great matters in Par|liament for His Service,</Q> if he might be at Liberty. The next day after He came to the Hou&s;e of Peers, the Lord <HI>Say</HI> made that Speech, which he &s;ince Printed; taking notice <Q>&startq;&endq;of &s;ome Imputations laid on him by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI></Q> That he &s;hould be a Sectary; which nobody can doubt, that reads that Speech: Yet he had no &s;ooner done, than that Bi&s;hop ro&s;e, and made a large Panegyrick in his Prai&s;e, and profe&s;s'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he allways believ'd his Lord&s;hip to be as far from <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> a Sectary,</Q> as Him&s;elf. And when he found the great de&s;ire of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to be freed from the Bi&s;hops Votes in that Trial; he never left Terrifying them with the Cen&s;ure that hung over Their heads for making the Canons, till he Per&s;waded them to Ingratiate them|&s;elves, by de&s;iring to be Excu&s;ed in that matter, before an Order &s;hould be made for their Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>THIS Example of the Bi&s;hops, prevail'd with &s;ome Lords, who had been created &s;ince the Accu&s;ation, to quit Their Right of Judging; and among&s;t them the Lord <HI>Littleton</HI> (who had been made a Baron upon the de&s;ire of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> for that only rea&s;on, that he pro|fe&s;s'd, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <Q>&startq;&endq;If he were a Peer, he would (and indeed he could) do Him notable Service) was the Fir&s;t who quitted his right to Judge,</Q> becau&s;e he had been a Commoner when the Accu&s;ation was fir&s;t brought up: but they who In&s;i&s;ted upon their Right (as the Lord <HI>Seymour,</HI> and others)

And it may be, their Un&s;ea&s;onable, Voluntary, Unju&s;t quit|ting it Then, made many men le&s;s &s;ollicitous for the Defence of Their Right Afterwards.

<P>FOR the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland;</HI> He complain'd much, <Q>&startq;&endq;that by an Or|der from the Committee which prepared his Charge again&s;t him, all his Papers in that Kingdom, by which he &s;hould make his Defence, <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"> were &s;eiz'd and taken from him; and by virtue of the &s;ame Order, all his Goods, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, Plate, and Tobacco (amounting, as he &s;aid, to Eighty Thou&s;and pounds) were likewi&s;e &s;eiz'd; &s;o that he had not money to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Pri&s;on: that all tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of State in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> who were mo&s;t Privy to the Acts for which he was Que&s;tion'd, and &s;o could give the be&s;t Evidence and Te&s;timony on his behalf, were Impri&s;on'd under the charge of Trea&s;on.

"However, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;he hoped no Indi&s;cretion, or Unskilfulne&s;s, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Pride of Words, would amount to Trea&s;on; and for Mi&s;demeanours, he was ready to Submit to their Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>HE made the lea&s;t, that is, the wor&s;t Excu&s;e, for tho&s;e Two Acts <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"> again&s;t the Lord <HI>Mountnorris,</HI> and the Lord Chancellor; which indeed were Powerful Acts, and manife&s;ted a nature exce&s;&s;ively Imperious; and no doubt, cau&s;ed a greater Di&s;like and Terror, in Sober and Di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Per&s;ons, than All that was alledged again&s;t him.

What Defence he made, I know not; for he was &s;o &s;urprized, that he knew not what the matter was, when he was Summon'd to that Council: but the Words being proved, he was deprived of his Office (being then Vice-Trea&s;urer) and his Foot-Company; committed to Pri&s;on; &s;entenced, "to lo&s;e his Head. The <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Office, and Company, were immediately di&s;po&s;ed of; and He impri&s;on'd, till the King &s;ent him over a Pardon, by which he was di&s;charged, with his Life; all the other parts of the Sentence being&punc; fully exe|cuted.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eem'd to all men a mo&s;t Prodigious cour&s;e of Proceeding; that in a time of full Peace, a Peer of the Kingdom and a Privy-Coun&s;ellor; for an Unadvi&s;ed, Pa&s;&s;ionate, My&s;terious Word (for the Expre&s;&s;ion was capable of many Interpretations) &s;hould be call&punc;d before a Council of War, which could not rea&s;onably be under&s;tood to have Then a Juri&s;|diction over Such Per&s;ons, and in Such Ca&s;es; and without any Pro|ce&s;s, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> or Formality of Defence, in two hours &s;hould be Deprived of his Life and Fortune: the Inju&s;tice whereof, &s;eem'd the more formidable, for that the Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was known, for &s;ome time before, to &s;tand in great Jealou&s;y and Disfavour with the Earl: which made it look'd on as a pure act of Revenge; and gave all men warning, how they tru&s;ted them&s;elves in the Territories where He commanded.</P>
<P>THE Earl, di&s;charged Him&s;elf of the rigour and &s;everity of the Sen|tence, and laid it upon <Q>&startq;&endq;the Council of War; where he Him&s;elf not only forbore to be Pre&s;ent, but would not &s;uffer his Brother, who was an Officer of the Army,</Q> to Stay there: he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;he had conjured the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Court, to proceed without any re&s;pect of favour or kindne&s;s to Him|&s;elf; and that, a&s;&s;oon as He under&s;tood the Judgement of the Council, which was Unanimous, he declared publickly (as he had likewi&s;e done
<PB N="175" REF="1970">
before) That a hair of his head &s;hould not peri&s;h; and immediately wrote an earne&s;t Letter to his Maje&s;ty, for the procuring his Pardon; which was by his Maje&s;ty, upon his Lord&s;hips recommendation and mediation, granted accordingly; and thereupon, the Lord <HI>Mountnor|ris</HI> was &s;et at Liberty: though, it is true, He was, after his enlarge|ment,</Q> not &s;uffer'd to come to <HI>England.</HI> He concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was an In&s;olent per&s;on; and that he took This cour&s;e to humble him: and that he would be very well content, that the Same cour&s;e might be taken to reform Him; if the &s;ame Care might like|wi&s;e <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> be, that it might prove no more to His prejudice, than the other had been to that Lord.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Standers by, made another Excu&s;e for him: <Q>&startq;&endq;The Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was a man of great Indu&s;try, Activity, and Experience, in the affairs of <HI>Ireland;</HI> having rai&s;ed him&s;elf from a very private, mean condition (having been an inferior Servant to the Lord <HI>Chiche|&s;ter)</HI></Q> <Q>&startq;&endq;to the degree of a Vi&s;count, and a Privy-Coun&s;ellor, and to a very ample Revenue in Lands and Offices; and had all ways, by Ser|vile Flattery and Sordid Application, wrought him&s;elf into Tru&s;t and Nearne&s;s with all Deputies, at their fir&s;t entrance upon their Charge, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> informing them of the Defects and Over&s;ights of their Predece&s;&s;ors; and, after the determination of their Commands, and return into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> informing the State here, and tho&s;e Enemies they u&s;ually con|tracted in that time, of what&s;oever they had done, or &s;uffer'd to be done, ami&s;s; whereby, they either &s;uffer'd Di&s;grace, or Damage, a&s;&s;oon as they were recall'd from tho&s;e Honours. In this manner, He be|gun with his own Ma&s;ter, the Lord <HI>Chiche&s;ter;</HI> and continued the &s;ame arts, upon the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who &s;uc|ceeded; and upon that &s;core, procured Admi&s;&s;ion and Tru&s;t with the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> upon His fir&s;t admi&s;&s;ion to that Government: So <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that this <HI>Dilemma</HI> &s;eem'd unque&s;tionable, That either the Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI> mu&s;t de&s;troy my Lord <HI>Mountnorris,</HI> whil&s;t he continued in his Office, or my Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> mu&s;t de&s;troy the Deputy, a&s;&s;oon as his Commi&s;&s;ion was determin'd.</Q> And upon this Con&s;ideration; be|&s;ides, that his no virtue made him unpitied; many look'd with le&s;s con|cernedne&s;s upon that Act, than the matter it Self de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e of the Lord Chancellor, &s;eem'd, to Common Under&s;tand|ings, an act of le&s;s Violence, becau&s;e it concern'd not Life; and had &s;ome &s;hew of Formality at lea&s;t, if not Regularity in the Proceeding; and that which was Ami&s;s in it, took its growth from a nobler Root than the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> other. The endeavour was, to compell the Lord Chancellor to &s;ettle more of his Land, and in another manner, upon his elde&s;t Son, than he had a mind to, and than he could Legally be compell'd to: This the Earl, upon a Paper Petition preferr'd to him by the Wi&s;e of that Son (a Lady, for whom the Earl had &s;o great a value and e&s;teem, that it made his Ju&s;tice the more &s;u&s;pected) pre&s;s'd, and in the end order'd him to do. The Chancellor refu&s;ed; was committed to Pri&s;on; and &s;hortly af|ter, the Great Seal taken from him, which he had kept with great repu|tation of Ability for the &s;pace of above Twenty years. In the pre&s;&s;ing this Charge, many things of Levity, as certain Letters of great Affection <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and Familiarity from the Earl to that Lady, which were found in her Cabinet after her death; others of Pa&s;&s;ion, were expo&s;ed to the publick view: to procure Prejudice rather to his Gravity and Di&s;cretion, than that they were in any degree Material to the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="1980">
THE Earl &s;aid little more to it, than <Q>&startq;&endq;that he hoped, what Pa&s;&s;ion &s;oever, or what Inju&s;tice &s;oever, might be found in that Proceeding, and Sentence, there would be no Trea&s;on: and that, for his part, he had yet rea&s;on to believe, what he had done was very Ju&s;t; &s;ince it had been review'd by his Maje&s;ty, and his Privy-Council here, upon an Appeal from the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Ely</HI> (the degraded Lord Chancellor) and upon a &s;olemn hearing There, which took up many days, it had receiv'd a Confirmation.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the truth is, That rather accu&s;ed the Earl of an Exce&s;s of Power than ab&s;olv'd him of Inju&s;tice; for mo&s;t men that weigh'd the whole <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> matter, believ'd it to be a high act of Oppre&s;&s;ion; and not to be without a mixture of that Policy, which was &s;poken of before in the Ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Mountnorris:</HI> For the Chancellor, being a per&s;on of great Expe|rience, Subtilty, and Prudence, had been all ways very Severe to de|parted Deputies; and not over agreeable, nor in any degree Submi&s;s, to Their full Power; and taking Him&s;elf to be the Second per&s;on in the Kingdom, during the holding of his Place, thought him&s;elf little le&s;s than Equal to the Fir&s;t, who could naturally hope but for a term of Years in that Superiority: neither had he ever before met with the lea&s;t Check, that might make him &s;u&s;pect a Diminution of his Authority, or <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT which was with mo&s;t Solemnity and expectation alledged again&s;t the Earl, as the Hinge upon which the Trea&s;on was principally to hang, was a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Earl's in the Committee of State (which They call'd <HI>the Cabinet Council)</HI> upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the former Parliament. S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> the Secretary of State, gave in Evidence, <Q>&startq;&endq;That the King at that time calling that Committee to him, ask'd them, Since he fail'd of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upply he expected by Sub&s;idies, what Cour&s;e he &s;hould now take? that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> an&s;wer'd, Sir, You have now done Your Duty, and your Subjects have fail'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in Theirs; and therefore you are ab&s;olv'd from the Rules of Govern|ment, and may &s;upply your &s;elf by Extraordinary Ways; You mu&s;t pro&s;ecute the War Vigorou&s;ly; You have an Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> with which you may reduce this Kingdom.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1.<Q>&startq;&endq;THAT by the Wi&s;dom and Tenderne&s;s of Parliaments, which knew that there could not be a greater Snare for the Subject, than to leave the nature of Trea&s;on undefined and unlimited, All Trea&s;ons were particularly mention'd and &s;et down in the Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw&punc;</HI> III <HI>de Proditionibus.</HI> That nothing is Trea&s;on, but what is com|prehended within that Statute; all Trea&s;ons before that Statute, as Killing the King's Unkle, his Nur&s;e, Piracy, and divers others, being re&s;train'd and taken away by the Declaration of that Act. And that no Words or Actions, in any of the Articles of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>s <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Charge,</Q> did amount to Trea&s;on within that Statute.</P>
<P N="2">2.<Q>&startq;&endq;THAT by rea&s;on of the Clau&s;e in that Statute, of declaring Trea|&s;on in Parliament, divers actions were declared to be Trea&s;ons in Par|liament, in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, to the great Pre|judice
<PB N="178" REF="2000">
of the Subject: It was therefore &s;pecially Provided, and Enacted, by a Statute in the Fir&s;t year of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, Chapter the Tenth, which is &s;till in force, That nothing &s;hould be declared and adjudged Trea&s;on, but what was ordain'd in that Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. by which Statute, all Power of declaring New Trea&s;ons in Parliament, was taken away; and that no Precedent of any Such Declaration in Parliament can be &s;hew'd &s;ince that time: All New Trea&s;ons, made by any Act of Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, being by the Statute of the Fir&s;t year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Chapter the Fir&s;t, taken away, and re&s;train'd to the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and that likewi&s;e by another Statute of the Fir&s;t year of Queen <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> Chapter the Tenth, All Trials of Trea&s;ons ought to be according to the Rules of the Commnon Law,</Q> and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3.<Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the Foundation upon which the Impeachment was framed, was Erroneous; for that (be&s;ides that it was confe&s;s'd on all hands, the Laws of the Kingdom were Not &s;ubverted) an Endeavour to Subvert the Fundamental Laws and Statutes of the Realm, by Force attempted, is not Trea&s;on, being only made Felony by the Statute of the Fir&s;t year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Chapter the Twelfth; which is likewi&s;e expired. That Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> in the Thirty third year of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, was indicted only of a Premunire, for an En|deavour to bring in the Imperial Laws into this Kingdom. And that an Endeavour, or Intention, to levy War, was made Trea&s;on, only by a Statute of the 13^t^h <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (a time very Inqui&s;itive for Trea|&s;on)</Q> which expired with Her life.</P>
<P N="4">4.<Q>&startq;&endq;LASTLY, That if any thing was alledged again&s;t the Earl which might be Penal to him, it was not Sufficiently and Legally proved; for that by the Statute of the Fir&s;t year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, Chapter the Twelfth, No man ought to be Arraign'd, Indicted, or Con|demn'd, of any Trea&s;on, unle&s;s it be upon the Te&s;timony of Two <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Lawful and Sufficient Witne&s;&s;es, produced in the Pre&s;ence of the Par|ty accu&s;ed; unle&s;s the party Confe&s;s the &s;ame: and if it be for Words, within Three Months after the &s;ame &s;poken, if the Party be within the Kingdom: Whereas there was in this Ca&s;e only One Witne&s;s, S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI></Q> and the words &s;poken Six Months before.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e being thus &s;tated on the Earl's behalf, the Judgement of the Lords, in Whom the Sole Power of Judicature was conceiv'd to be, was by all men expected; the Hou&s;e of Commons having declared, <Q>&startq;&endq;that They intended not to make any Reply to the Argument of Law made by M^r <HI>Lane,</HI> it being below Their Dignity to contend with a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Private Lawyer.</Q> Indeed They had a more convincing way to proceed<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill of Attainder brought into the Hou&s;e again&s;t the Earl.</NOTE> by; for the next day after that Argument, S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI> (Bro|ther in Law to the Lord <HI>Brook)</HI> an ab&s;urd, bold man, brought up by M^r <HI>Pym,</HI> and &s;o employ'd by that Party to make any attempt, preferr'd a Bill in the Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q>&startq;&endq;for the Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> of High Trea&s;on:</Q> it being ob&s;erv'd, that by what the Earl had &s;aid for him&s;elf in the matter of fact and in matter of prudence, of the Con&s;equence of &s;uch an extraordinary Proceeding; and by what had been &s;aid for him in the point of Law; mo&s;t Sober men, who had been, and &s;till were, full enough of Di&s;like and Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Earl, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> were not at all &s;atisfied in the Ju&s;tice of the Impeachment, or in the Man|ner of the Pro&s;ecution: and therefore, that the Hou&s;e of Peers, which con&s;i&s;ted of near one Hundred and Twenty, be&s;ides the Bi&s;hops, and of
<PB N="179" REF="2010">
whom Four&s;core had been con&s;tantly attending the Trial, were not like to take upon Them the Burthen of &s;uch a Judgement as was expected.</P>
<P>THE Bill was receiv'd with wonderful alacrity, and immediately read the fir&s;t and the &s;econd time, and &s;o Committed: which was not u&s;ual in Parliaments, except in matters of great concernment and conve|niency in the particular; or of little importance or moment in the ge|neral. Tho&s;e who at Fir&s;t con&s;ented, upon &s;light information, to his Im|peachment, upon no other rea&s;on, but (as hath been &s;aid before) be|cau&s;e <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> They were only to Accu&s;e, and the Lords to Judge, and &s;o thought to be troubled no more with it, being Now as ready to Judge, as they had been to Accu&s;e; finding &s;ome new rea&s;ons to &s;atisfy them&s;elves, of which one was, "They had gone too far to Sit &s;till, or Retire.</P>
<P>A DAY or two before the Bill of Attainder was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, there was a very remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, of which, the Pretence was, <Q>&startq;&endq;to make One Witne&s;s, with divers Circum&s;tances, as good as Two;</Q> though I believe it was directed Intruth to an End very forreign to that which was propo&s;ed. The words of the Earl of <HI>Straf|ford,</HI> by which, <Q>&startq;&endq;his endeavour to alter the frame of Government, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> his intention to levy War,</Q> &s;hould principally appear, were proved Singly by S^r <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> which had been often averr'd, and promi&s;ed, &s;hould be proved by Several Witne&s;&s;es; and the Law was clear, <Q>&startq;&endq;that le&s;s than Two Witne&s;&s;es ought not to be receiv'd in ca&s;e of Trea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>To make this Single Te&s;timony appear as Sufficient as if it had been confirm'd by more, M^r <HI>Pym</HI> inform'd the Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q>&startq;&endq;of the Grounds upon which he fir&s;t advi&s;ed that Charge, and was &s;atisfied that he &s;hould &s;ufficiently Prove it. That &s;ome months before the be|ginning of this Parliament, He had vi&s;ited young S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Secretary, who was then newly recover'd from an <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Ague; that They being together, and Condoling the &s;ad condition of the Kingdom, by rea&s;on of the many Illegal Taxes and Pre&s;&s;ures, S^r <HI>Harry</HI> told him, If he would call upon Him the next day, He would &s;hew him &s;omewhat that would give him much trouble, and inform him, What Coun&s;els were like to be follow'd to the Ruin of the King|dom; for that He had, in peru&s;al of &s;ome of his Father's Papers, accidentally met with the Re&s;ult of the Cabinet Council upon the Di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament, which comprehended the Re&s;olu|tions then taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE next day He &s;hew'd him a little Paper of the Secretary's own <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> writing; in which was contain'd the day of the Month, and the Re&s;ults of &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es made by &s;everal Coun&s;ellors; with &s;everal Hic|roglyphicks, which &s;ufficiently expre&s;s'd the Per&s;ons by whom tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es were made. The matter was of &s;o Tran&s;cendent a Nature, and the Coun&s;el &s;o Prodigious, with reference to the Common-wealth, that he de&s;ired he might take a Copy of it; which the young Gen|tleman would by no means Con&s;ent to, fearing it might prove Prejudi|cial to his Father. But when M^r <HI>Pym</HI> inform'd him, That it was of extream Con&s;equence to the Kingdom, and that a time might proba|bly come, when the Di&s;covery of This, might be a Soveraign means <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> to Pre&s;erve both Church and State, he was contented that M^r <HI>Pym</HI> &s;hould take a Copy of it; which he did, in the pre&s;ence of S^r <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> and having examin'd it, together with him, deliver'd the Ori|ginal again to S^r <HI>Henry.</HI> That he had carefully kept this Copy by him,
<PB N="180" REF="2020">
without communicating the &s;ame to any body, till the beginning of this Parliament, which was the time he conceiv'd fit to make u&s;e of it; and that then, meeting with many other In&s;tances of the Earl's Ill Di&s;po&s;ition to the Kingdom, it &s;atisfied him to move what&s;oever he had moved, again&s;t that great Per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid thus much, he read the Paper in his hand; in which the day of the Month was &s;et down, and his Maje&s;ty to be pre&s;ent, and &s;tating the Que&s;tion to be, <Q>&startq;&endq;What was now to be done? &s;ince the Parliament had Refu&s;ed to give Sub&s;idies for the &s;upply of the War a|gain&s;t <HI>Scotland</HI></Q> There were then written, two <HI>LLs</HI> and a <HI>t</HI> over, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> an <HI>I</HI> and an <HI>r,</HI> which was urged, <Q>&startq;&endq;could &s;ignify nothing but <HI>Lord Liev|tenant of Ireland;</HI></Q> and the Words written and applied to that Name, were, <Q>&startq;&endq;Ab&s;olv'd from Rules of Government;&mdash;Pro&s;ecute the War vi|gorou&s;ly;</Q>&mdash;An Army in <HI>Ireland</HI> to &s;ubdue this Kingdom&mdash;;which was urged, "to comprehend the matter of the Earl's Speech and Advice: that Paper, by Fractions of Words (without mentioning any Form'd Speech) containing only the Re&s;ults of the &s;everal Coun&s;ellors Advice. Before tho&s;e Letters which were order'd to &s;ignify the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> were an <HI>A.B.C.G.</HI> which might be under&s;tood to &s;ignify, <HI>the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury his Grace;</HI> and at tho&s;e Letters, &s;ome &s;hort <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;harp expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t Parliaments, and thereupon, fierce advice to the King. Next in the Paper, was an <HI>M</HI> with an <HI>r</HI> over, and an <HI>Ho,</HI> which were to be under&s;tood for Marquis <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e;</HI> and the words annex'd thereunto &s;eem'd to be rough, but without a Supplement &s;ignified nothing. Then there was an <HI>L,</HI> an <HI>H,</HI> and an <HI>A,</HI> which mu&s;t be interpreted <HI>Lord High Admiral,</HI> which was the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and from that Hieroglyphick proceeded only a few words, which implied advice to the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;to be Advi&s;ed by his Parliament.</Q> Then there was <HI>L^$ Cott.</HI> (which would ea&s;ily be be|liev'd to &s;ignify <HI>the Lord Cottington)</HI> with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions as &s;harp as <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> tho&s;e applied to the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he had read this Paper, he added; <Q>&startq;&endq;That though there was but One Witne&s;s directly in the point, S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> the Secretary, who&s;e Hand-writing that Paper was, whereof this was a Copy; Yet he conceiv&punc;d, tho&s;e Circum&s;tances of His; and young S^r <HI>Henry Vane'</HI>s having Seen tho&s;e Original Re&s;ults, and being ready to Swear, that the Paper read by Him was a true Copy of the other; might rea&s;onably amount to the validity of Another Witne&s;s: and that it was no won|der, that the Other per&s;ons mention'd in that Writing, who had given as bad Coun&s;el, would not remember, for their Own &s;akes, what had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> pa&s;s'd in that Conference; and that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> (who was the only Good Coun&s;ellor in the pack) had remember'd Some of the words,</Q> of a high nature, though he had forgotten the Other.</P>
<P>WHEN M^r <HI>Pym</HI> had ended, young S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> ro&s;e, in &s;ome &s;eem|ing Di&s;order; confe&s;s'd all that the Other had &s;aid; and added, <Q>&startq;&endq;That his Father being in the North with the King the Summer before, had &s;ent up his Keys to his Secretary, then at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and had Writ|ten to Him (his Son) that He &s;hould take from him tho&s;e Keys which open'd his Boxes where his Writings and Evidences of his Land were, to the end, that he might cau&s;e an A&s;&s;urance to be perfected <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> which concern'd his Wife; and that He having peru&s;ed tho&s;e Evi|dences, and di&s;patch'd what depended thereupon, had the curio&s;ity to &s;ee what was in a red Velvet Cabinet which &s;tood with the other
<PB N="181" REF="2030">
Boxes; and thereupon required the Key of that Cabinet from the Se|cretary, as if he &s;till wanted &s;omewhat towards the bu&s;ine&s;s his Father had directed; and &s;o having gotten the Key, he found, among&s;t other Papers, That mention'd by M^r <HI>Pym;</HI> which made that Impre&s;&s;ion in him, that he thought him&s;elf bound in Con&s;cience to communicate it to &s;ome Per&s;on of better Judgement than him&s;elf, who might be more able to Prevent the Mi&s;chiefs that were threatned therein; and &s;o &s;hewed it to M^r <HI>Pym;</HI> and being confirm'd by Him, that the &s;ea|&s;onable Di&s;covery thereof might do no le&s;s than Pre&s;erve the King|dom, <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"> had con&s;ented that He &s;hould take a Copy thereof; which, to His knowledge, he had faithfully done: and thereupon, had laid the Origi|nal in its proper place again, in the red Velvet Cabinet. He &s;aid, He knew this Di&s;covery would prove little le&s;s than his Ruin, in the good opinion of his Father; but having been induced, by the tender|ne&s;s of his Con&s;cience towards his Common Parent his Country, to Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t his natural Father, He hoped he &s;hould find Compa&s;|&s;ion from that Hou&s;e, though he had little hopes of Pardon el&s;e|where.</Q></P>
<P>THE Son no &s;ooner &s;ate down, than the Father (who, without any <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> counterfeiting, had a natural appearance of Sternne&s;s) ro&s;e, with a pret|ty Confu&s;ion; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;That the Ground of his Misfortune was N$w di&s;cover'd to him; that He had been much amazed, when he found him&s;elf pre&s;s'd by &s;uch Interrogatories, as made him Su&s;pect &s;ome Di&s;covery to be made, by &s;ome Per&s;on as conver&s;ant in the Coun&s;els as Him&s;elf: But he was now &s;atisfied to Whom he ow'd his Misfor|tunes; in which, He was &s;ure, the Guilty Per&s;on &s;hould bear his &s;hare. That it was true, being in the North with the King; and that Un|fortunate Son of his, having married a Virtuous Gentlewoman (Daugh|ter to a worthy Member then pre&s;ent) to Whom there was &s;ome|what <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in Ju&s;tice and Honour due, which was not &s;ufficiently &s;ettled; He had &s;ent his Keys to his Secretary; not well knowing in what Box the material Writings lay; and directed him&punc; to &s;uffer his Son to look after tho&s;e Evidences which were nece&s;&s;ary: that by this occa&s;ion it &s;eem'd, tho&s;e Papers had been examin'd and peru&s;ed, which had be|got much of this trouble. That for His part, after the Summons of this Parliament, and the King's return to <HI>London,</HI> he had acquainted his Maje&s;ty, that he had many Papers remaining in his hands, of &s;uch tran&s;actions as were not like to be of further u&s;e; and therefore, if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed, he would Burn them, le&s;t by any accident they <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"> might come into hands that might make an ill u&s;e of them: to which his Maje&s;ty con&s;enting, he had burn'd many; and among&s;t them, the Original Re&s;ults of tho&s;e Debates, of which, that which was read was pretended to be a Copy: that to the Particulars, He could &s;ay no|thing more, than what he had upon his Examination expre&s;s'd, which was exactly true, and he would not deny; though by what he had heard that afternoon (with which he was &s;urprized and amazed) he &s;ound him&s;elf in an Ill condition upon that Te&s;timony.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Scene was &s;o well acted, with &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion and Ge&s;tures, be|tween the Father and the Son, that many Speeches were made in com|mendation <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the Con&s;cience, Integrity, and Merit, of the Young man, and a motion made, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Father might be enjoin'd by the Hou&s;e to be Friends with his Son:</Q> but for &s;ometime there was, in Publick, a great Di&s;tance ob&s;erv'd between them.</P>

MANY men wonder&punc;d very much at the unnece&s;&s;ary relation of this Story; which would vi&s;ibly appear very Ridiculous to the world, and could not but inevitably produce much Scandal and Inconvenience to the Father, and the Son; who were too wi&s;e to believe, that tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances would add any thing to the Credit of the former &s;ingle Te&s;ti|mony: neither was there ever after any mention of it in Publick, to move the Judgement of Tho&s;e, who were concern'd to be Satisfied in what they were to do: and therefore Some who ob&s;erv'd the Strata|gems u&s;ed by that Party to compa&s;s their own private ends, believ'd, that This occa&s;ion was taken to publi&s;h tho&s;e Re&s;ults, Only to give the Lord <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <HI>Cottington</HI> notice in what Danger he was, that &s;o he might wi&s;ely quit his Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Wards to the Lord <HI>Say;</HI> who expected it, and might be able, by that obligation, to Protect him from farther Pro&s;ecution: and &s;o that they meant to Sacrifice the Reputation of the Secretary, to the ambition of the Lord <HI>Say.</HI> But without doubt (though this la&s;t con|&s;ideration was very powerful with them) the true rea&s;on of the com|munication of this Pa&s;&s;age, was, that they found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to Conceal their having receiv'd the Principal Information from the Secretary, for their Whole Pro&s;ecution; by rea&s;on of &s;omeof the Com|mittee, who were intru&s;ted to prepare the Charge again&s;t the Earl of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> <HI>Strafford,</HI> and con&s;equently were privy to that Secret, were fallen from them; at lea&s;t from their Ends; and therefore they thought fit to Publi&s;h this Hi&s;tory of the Intelligence, that it might be rather imputed to the Con&s;cience, and Curio&s;ity of the Son, than to the Malice of the Father.</P>

<P>THERE was a Difference in Opinion in this Debate, between Two per&s;ons, who had been never known to differ in the Hou&s;e, and the en|tire Friend&s;hip they had for each other was very remarkable; which ad|mini&s;tred much Plea&s;ure to very many who loved neither of them.

<P>HE &s;hook his head, and an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;Stone Dead hath no Fellow: that if he were judged Guilty in a Premunire, according to the Precedents cited by Him; or Fined in any other way; and Sentenced to be Im|pri&s;on'd during his life; the King would pre&s;ently grant him his Par|don, and his E&s;tate, relea&s;e all Fines, and would likewi&s;e give him his Liberty, as &s;oon as He had a mind to receive his Service; which would be a&s;&s;oon as the Parliament &s;hould be ended.</Q> And when M^r <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"> <HI>Hyde</HI> was ready to reply to him; the Earl told him Familiarly, <Q>&startq;&endq;that He had been Tired that afternoon upon that Argument, and therefore de&s;ired him to continue the di&s;cour&s;e no longer Then; a&s;&s;uring him, He would be ready to Confer with him upon it at any other time.</Q></P>
<P>SHORTLY after, M^$ <HI>Hyde</HI> took another opportunity to &s;peak freely with him again concerning it, but found him upon his guard; and though he heard all the Other would &s;ay, with great patience, yet he did not at all enlarge in his an&s;wers, but &s;eem'd fix'd in his re&s;olution: and when he was pre&s;s'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;how Unju&s;tifiable a thing it was, for any man to do any thing which his Con&s;cience inform'd him was Sinful; that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> He knew him &s;o well, that if He were not Satisfied in his Own Con|&s;cience, of the Guilt of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> the King could never be able to oblige him to give his Vote for that Bill; and therefore He wonder'd, how he could urge the King, to do an act which He de|clared to be &s;o Much again&s;t his Con&s;cience, that he neither could, nor would, ever give his Royal A&s;&s;ent to that Bill:</Q> The Earl an|&s;wer'd more at large, and with &s;ome commotion (as if he were intruth po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with that opinion him&s;elf) <Q>&startq;&endq;That the King was obliged in Con&s;cience, to conform Him&s;elf, and his own Under&s;tanding, to the Advice and Con&s;cience of his Parliament:</Q> which was a Doctrine new|ly <MILESTONE N="3$" UNIT="line"> re&s;olv'd by Their Divines, and of great U&s;e to them for the pur&s;uing their future Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, the Bill had not that warm reception in the Hou&s;e of Peers, that was expected; but, after the Fir&s;t reading, re&s;ted many days; and being then read the Second time, depended long at the Committee: few men believing, upon con&s;ideration of the Af|fections and Parts of the Several Lords, that of the Four&s;core, who were pre&s;ent at the Trial, above Twenty would ever have Con&s;ented to that Act: Be&s;ides, it was not believ'd, now the Formal Trial and way of Ju|dicature was waved, the Bi&s;hops would &s;o Stupidly (to &s;ay no wor&s;e) <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Exclude them&s;elves from Voting in a Law, which was to be an Act of parliament.</P>

<P>THE Meetings continuing, between tho&s;e Officers of the Army and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;ome Servants of his Maje&s;ty's, to the Ends afore&s;aid; Others of the Army, who had expre&s;s'd very brisk re&s;olutions towards the Service, and were of eminent Command and Authority with the Soldiers, were by &s;pecial direction introduced into tho&s;e Councils (all per&s;ons obliging them&s;elves by an Oath of Secrecy, not to communicate any thing that &s;hould pa&s;s among&s;t them) for the better executing what &s;hould be agreed.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t meeting, One of the Per&s;ons that was &s;o introduced, after he had heard the calm Propo&s;itions of the re&s;t, and that <Q>&startq;&endq;Their de|&s;ign was, only to ob&s;erve and defend the Laws, that Neither the Ar|guments <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor the Reputation of their Army, might com|pell the King to Con&s;ent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church, nor to remove the Bi&s;hops out of the Hou&s;e of Peers, which

<P>WHETHER the Per&s;on that propo&s;ed this de&s;perate advice, did it on|ly as a Bait, to draw an opinion from other men (for he had a perfect di&s;like and malice to &s;ome of the company) or whether the Di&s;dain to &s;ee his Coun&s;el rejected, and the Fear that it might be di&s;cover'd to his Di&s;advantage, wrought upon him, I know not; But the &s;ame, or the next day, He di&s;cover'd All, and More than had pa&s;s'd, to &s;ome of Tho&s;e who &s;eem'd to take mo&s;t care for the Publick; intimated to them, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> <Q>&startq;&endq;how He was Startled with the horrour of the de&s;ign, and how Faith|fully He re&s;olv'd to &s;erve the Common-wealth, or to lo&s;e his Life in the attempt:</Q> Yet, at the &s;ame time, acted his part at Court, with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of Abhorring the Proceedings of the Parlia|ment, to that degree, that he offer'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;to undertake with a Crew of Of|ficers and good Fellows (who, he &s;aid, were at His di&s;po&s;al) to Re&s;cue the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> from the Lievtenant of the Tower, as he &s;hould bring him to his Trial, and &s;o to enable him to make an e&s;cape in|to Forreign parts.</Q></P>

<P>WHILST they were full of Clamour again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, upon the in|&s;tances of &s;ome In&s;olences and Indi&s;cretions committed by them, during <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the late intervals of Parliament (and mention&punc;d before) e&s;pecially upon a great Alacrity expre&s;s'd, and Contribution rai&s;ed, the year before, for advancing the War with <HI>Scotland;</HI> an Order was made, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Ju&s;tices of Peace of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;hould carefully examine, what Stran|gers were lodg'd within their Juri&s;diction; and that they &s;hould ad|mini&s;ter the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to all &s;u&s;pected for Recu&s;ancy,</Q> and proceed according to tho&s;e Statutes.

<P>SUCH a Committee was appointed to Examine, and &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, as was de&s;ired.

<P>THIS was no &s;ooner known and publi&s;h'd, than it gave great Credit and Reputation to M^r <HI>Pym</HI>'s Vigilancy and Activity; for it now ap|pear'd, there was &s;ome notable Mi&s;chief intended, upon the Di&s;overy whereof, &s;ome Eminent men were Fled.

<P>HAVING gotten thus much ground; and the Bill then depending (and like long to depend) with the Lords; M^r <HI>Pym</HI> told them in the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it appear'd by the Flight of &s;uch Con&s;idera|ble Per&s;ons, that what he had before imparted to them was of Mo|ment, and that his Fears were not groundle&s;s; that it concern'd Their Service, that he &s;hould not Yet impart the whole matter to them, &s;ince the Danger was prevented, which they &s;hould &s;hortly under&s;tand at large: in the mean time, he did a&s;&s;ure them, That God had mira|culou&s;ly Pre&s;erv'd them from a mo&s;t Prodigious Con&s;piracy, in which all their Priviledges and Liberties &s;hould have been &s;wallow'd up: That though This attempt was Di&s;appointed, yet he fear'd there might be &s;ome New device;</Q> and therefore He propo&s;ed, <Q>for the better evi|dence <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of their Union and Unanimity (which would be the greate&s;t Di&s;|couragement to all who wi&s;h'd Ill to them) that &s;ome Prote&s;tation might be entred into by the Members of Both Hou&s;es, for the Defence of their Priviledges, and the Performance of tho&s;e Duties to God and the King, which they were obliged to, as good Chri&s;tians and good Subjects; and that a Committee might be appointed &s;peedily, to with|draw and prepare &s;uch a Prote&s;tation.</Q></P>
<P>THE Motion was entertain'd with general Approbation; in&s;omuch as they who were apprehen&s;ive enough of the Ill De&s;igns of tho&s;e who advanced This, and of the Ill con&s;equence of &s;uch Voluntary Prote&s;ta|tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> thought fit rather to watch the Matter and Words, than to op|po&s;e the Thing it &s;elf; which, it was evident, it was to no purpo&s;e to do: and therefore they were well contented with the naming Such Per|&s;ons for the Committee, as were not like to &s;ubmit to any Unlawful or

<P>IT may ea&s;ily be &s;aid, that the Freedom of the Parliament, and His own Negative voice, being thus Barbarou&s;ly invaded, if his Maje&s;ty had, in&s;tead of Pa&s;&s;ing that Act, come to the Hou&s;e and Di&s;&s;olv'd the Par|liament; or if he had withdrawn him&s;elf from that Seditious City, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> put him&s;elf in the head of his own Army; much of the Mi&s;chief, which hath Since happen'd, would have been prevented.

could well remember the time, when He Led tho&s;e People, who then Par&s;ued Him to his Grave. He was a man of great Parts, and extraor|dinary Endowments of Nature; not unadorn d with &s;ome addition of Art and Learning, though that again was more improved and illu&s;trated by the other; for he had a readine&s;s of Conception, and &s;harpne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, which made his Learning thought more than intruth it was.

The&s;e Succe&s;&s;es, applied to a nature too Elate and Haughty of it &s;elf; and a quicker progre&s;s into the greate&s;t Employments and Tru&s;t; made him more tran&s;ported with Di&s;dain of other men, and more Contemning the Forms of bu&s;ine&s;s, than happily he would have been, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> it he had met with &s;ome Interruptions in the beginning; and had pa&s;s'd in a more lei&s;urely gradation to the office of a States-man.</P>
<P>HE was no doubt of great ob&s;ervation, and a piercing judgement, both in Things, and Per&s;ons; but this too good skill in Per&s;ons, made him judge the wor&s;e of Things: for it was his Misfortune, to be in a time wherein very few Wi&s;e men were equally employ'd with him; and &s;carce any (but the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> who&s;e Tru&s;t was more confined) who&s;e Faculties and Abilities were equal to His: So that upon the matter he relied wholely upon Him&s;elf; and di&s;cerning many Defects in mo&s;t men, he too much neglected what they &s;aid or did.

<P>THESE Alterations were highly re&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as argument of Jealou&s;y between the King and the Parliament, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it &s;hould be imaginable the Members of both Hou&s;es, who re&s;ided from their hou&s;es and conveniences at great charge for the &s;ervice of the Publick, would de&s;ire to continue longer together than the nece&s;&s;ity of that Service &s;hould require; without con&s;idering, that it was more unlikely that the King (who had conde&s;cended &s;o far to them, and had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> yet intruth receiv'd no fruit from their meeting) would Di&s;&s;olve them, as long as they intended that for which they were &s;ummon'd toge|ther, and contain'd them&s;elves within the bounds of Duty and Mo|deration.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Commons &s;toutly in&s;i&s;ted on their own Bill; and the Lords, in that hurry of Noi&s;e and Confu&s;ion, when the meetings of the Peo|ple were &s;o frequent, kindly Con&s;ented likewi&s;e to it: and &s;o, by the unportunity, and upon the undertaking of per&s;ons He then mo&s;t tru&s;ted, in the agony of the other di&s;patch, the King was induced to include that Bill in the Commi&s;&s;ion with the Act of Attainder, and they were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Both Pa&s;s'd together.</P>
<P>AFTER the Pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e two Bills, the temper and &s;pirit of the Peo|ple, both within and without the walls of the two Hou&s;es, grew mar|vellous calm and compo&s;ed; there being likewi&s;e, about that time, Pa&s;s'd

<P>BUT what provi&s;ions &s;o ever were made for the Publick, Particular per&s;ons had receiv'd no &s;atisfaction.

that the greatne&s;s of that Reputation, was but an effect of the &s;ingu|lar Grace and Favour &s;hew'd to him by his Maje&s;ty; who, immediate|ly upon the death of his Father, had taken this Earl (being then le&s;s than Thirty years of age) into His immediate and eminent care; fir&s;t made him a Privy-Coun&s;ellor; then Knight of the Order of the Gar|ter; then (that he might fit him by degrees for the greate&s;t Tru&s;t and Employments &s;ent him Admiral into the Narrow Seas, of a Royal Navy; and after a Summer &s;pent in that exerci&s;e&punc; made him Lord high Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and to the very minute of which we &s;peak, pro|&s;ecuted him with all manner and demon&s;tration of Re&s;pect and Kind|ne&s;s; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and (as I heard his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf &s;ay) <Q>&startq;&endq;courted him as his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and conver&s;ed with him as his Friend, without the lea&s;t interruption or intermi&s;&s;ion of any po&s;&s;ible favour and kindne&s;s.</Q> And therefore many, who ob&s;erv&punc;d this great Earl purcha&s;e this opportu|nity of Di&s;&s;erving the King, at the price of his Brother's honour, and of his Own gratitude, concluded, that he had &s;ome notable tempta|tion in Con&s;cience, and that the Court was much Wor&s;e than it was believ&punc;d to be.</P>

<P>AFTER the Act for the Continuance of the Parliament, the Hou&s;e of Commons took much more upon them, in point of their Privi|ledges, than they had done; and more undervalued the concurrence of the Peers; though that Act, neither Added any thing to, nor Ex|tended their Juri&s;diction: which Juri&s;diction, the Wi&s;dom of Former times kept from being Limited or Defined; there being Then no dan|ger of Exce&s;s; and it being much more agreeable to the nature of the Supream Court to have an Unlimited Juri&s;diction.

<P>IT was wonder'd at by many, and &s;ure was a great Misfortune to the King, that he cho&s;e not rather, at that time &punc;though the bu&s;ine&s;s was only to Disband) to con&s;titute the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> General of his Army, than the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> for (be&s;ides that it would have been an act of much more grace and &s;atisfaction to the People, and to the Soldiery) his Maje&s;ty having lately given him &s;o great an earne&s;t of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> his tru&s;t, as the making him Chamberlain of his Hou&s;e, he ought in Policy to have pur&s;ued that work, by any &s;ea&s;onable accumulation of Favour, till he had made him his perfect Creature; which had been very ea&s;y, if skilfully attempted: for his Pride and Ambition, which

were not accompanied with any habit of Ill Nature&punc; were very capable of Obligations; and he had a Faithfulne&s;s and Con&s;tancy in his na|ture, which had kept him allways Religious in matter of tru&s;t; Then, he was allmo&s;t a declared Enemy to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation; and would have been very Punctual in all Formalities and Decencies, which had any relation to his Ma&s;ter's Honour, or the Honour of the Nation. In a word, he might have been Impo&s;ed upon in his under&s;tanding, but could not have been Corrupted, by hopes or fears of what the two Hou&s;es could have done to him; and was then more the Idol of the People, than intruth the Idolater of them. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>WHEREAS, by making the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> General, his Maje&s;ty much Di&s;obliged the Other, who expected it, and to whom it had been in a manner offer'd; and made him apprehend &s;ome Di&s;tru&s;t in the King towards him; and that his former Favour in his Office had been conferr'd on him, rather becau&s;e no man el&s;e had been able to bear the Envy of Di&s;placing the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> than that his Own Merit and Service was valued.

<P>MEN now believ'd, that they would be very forward in Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army, and Disbanding the other, which co&s;t the King|dom &s;o va&s;t a Sum of money every month; and they had already voted a Brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Scots</HI> of three hundred thou&s;and pounds, for the Service They had perform'd; and an Act was already prepared for the rai&s;ing the Sum: but They had yet no mind to part with their Beloved Brethren. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners who treated with the <HI>Scots,</HI> had agreed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the King &s;hould be pre&s;ent in his Parliament in <HI>Edenborough,</HI> by &s;uch a day in <HI>July,</HI> to Pa&s;s the Act for Pacification between the two Kingdoms, and &s;uch other Acts as his Parliament there &s;hould pro|po&s;e to him;</Q> and his Maje&s;ty prepared to begin his Progre&s;s, &s;oon enough to be in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the time; and they re&s;olv'd on all &s;ides, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the one Army &s;hould be drawn out of the Kingdom, and the other totally Disbanded, before the King &s;hould arrive in the Northern parts, for many rea&s;ons.</Q> As They had lo&s;t all confidence in the af|fections of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, &s;o there were many Jealou&s;ies ari&s;en a|mong <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the <HI>Scots;</HI> both in their Army, and among&s;t their greate&s;t Coun|&s;ellors: notwith&s;tanding all which, in&s;tead of making ha&s;t to the Di&s;|banding, They publi&s;h'd much Jealou&s;y and Di&s;&s;atisfaction to remain

<P>THEIR de&s;ign was to remove the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> from the King; both becau&s;e they had a mind to have his Office of Warden of the Cinque-Ports from him, that it might be conferr'd on the Earl of <HI>War|wick;</HI> and as He was allmo&s;t the Only man of great Quality and Con|&s;ideration about the King, who did not in the lea&s;t degree &s;toop, or <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> make court to them, but cro&s;s'd them boldly in the Hou&s;e; and all other ways pur&s;ued his Ma&s;ter's Service, with his utmo&s;t vigour and in|tentne&s;s of mind: They could not charge him with any thing like a Crime, and therefore only intended by &s;ome Vote to Brand him, and make him Odious; by which they pre&s;umed, they &s;hould at la&s;t make him willing to ran&s;om him&s;elf by quitting that Office: For which, there was &s;ome underhand treaty, by per&s;ons who were &s;ollicitous to Prevent farther Inconveniences; and as they found any thing like to &s;uc|ceed in that, they &s;lacken'd or advanced their di&s;cour&s;e of Evil Coun|&s;ellors.</P>

<P>THEY were exceedingly apprehen&s;ive that he meant the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> (who, for the rea&s;ons afore&s;aid, was very dear to them) that thenceforward, though they de&s;i&s;ted not from pro&s;ecuting the Duke, till at la&s;t they had compell'd him to quit the Cinque-Ports to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> They no more urged the Di&s;covery of Evil <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Coun&s;ellors.

the Hou&s;e of Commons grew into a perplex'd Debate, concerning the King's Journey into <HI>Scotland</HI> (which had been long before known, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Scot|land;</HI> where preparation was made for his reception, and the Parlia|ment &s;ummon'd there accordingly) and expre&s;s'd many dark and doubt|ful apprehen&s;ions of his Safety; not without &s;ome glances, <Q>&startq;&endq;that if his Maje&s;ty were once with his Army, he might po&s;&s;ibly enter upon new Coun&s;els,</Q> before he con&s;ented to Disband it; and in the end concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;to de&s;ire the Lords to join with them, in a Reque&s;t to <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"> the King, to defer his journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the Act of Pacifica|tion was pa&s;s'd, the Armies disbanded, and till &s;uch other Acts were prepared,</Q> as &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the King|dom; without mentioning any time, again&s;t which tho&s;e things &s;hould be ready: which, though it was an unrea&s;onable reque&s;t, yet, mo&s;t men having no mind the King &s;hould go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was con|&s;ented to by Both Hou&s;es; and thereupon, an Addre&s;s was made to his Maje&s;ty to that purpo&s;e: who return'd his An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;&endq;that He was &s;or|ry, the Hou&s;es having had &s;o long notice of his intentions for that Journey (which could not but appear very rea&s;onable to them) had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> neglected to prepare all &s;uch things, as were nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;patch'd by him before he went; That, though his pre&s;ence in <HI>Scotland</HI> was depended upon, by &s;uch a day, and the Di&s;appointment might beget &s;ome Prejudice to him, yet, he was content to &s;atisfy Their de&s;ires &s;o far, as to defer his Journey for Fourteen days; within which time they might make all things ready that were of importance, and be|yond which time it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him to make any &s;tay.</Q></P>
<P>THIS time being gotten, They proceeded but &s;lowly in the Directions for Disbanding (though the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was gone down to the Army) <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> or in the Act of the Pacification; but continued their men|tion <Q>&startq;&endq;of Fears and Jealou&s;ies of the Peace of the Kingdom; of an In|va&s;ion from Forreign parts; and an In&s;urrection of the Papi&s;ts in <HI>Eng|land:</HI> again&s;t all which, they &s;aid, there was not yet Sufficient Pro|vi&s;ion,</Q> by the Laws and Con&s;titution of the Kingdom. And there|fore one day, S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI> (who, as was &s;aid before, was u&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI> pre|fers a Bill for Settling the Militia</NOTE> by that Party, like the Dove out of the Ark, to try what Footing there was) preferr'd a Bill <Q>&startq;&endq;for the Settling the Militia of the Kingdom, both by Sea and Land,</Q> in Such per&s;ons as They &s;hould nominate; with all tho&s;e Powers and Juri&s;dictions, which have been Since granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> by Land, or to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by Sea. There were in the Bill no Names, but Blanks to receive them, when the matter &s;hould be pa&s;s'd; though men were a&s;&s;ured, that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was their Confident by Land, and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> by Sea: and yet the inclination to the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> would have begot &s;ome di&s;turbance, if the matter had come then to be pre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Title of this Bill was read, it gave &s;o general an Offence<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sollicitor <HI>Saint-John</HI> &s;econds it.</NOTE> to the Hou&s;e, that it &s;eem'd inclined to throw it out, without &s;uffering it to be read&punc; not without &s;ome Reproach to the per&s;on that brought <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> it in, "as a matter of Sedition; till M^r <HI>Saint-John,</HI> the King's Solli|citor, ro&s;e up, and &s;poke to it, and (having, intruth, Him&s;elf drawn the Bill) &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;He thought That Pa&s;&s;ion and Di&s;like very un&s;ea&s;ona|ble, Before the Bill was read; That it was the highe&s;t Priviledge of

For the Nomination of Per&s;ons, it would not be &s;ea&s;onable to &s;peak of it, till the Power and Juri&s;diction were fir&s;t &s;ettled and con&s;tituted; and then, if it &s;eem'd too great for any Subject, it might be devolv'd upon the Crown; which Yet was not &s;ufficiently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Legal Power to the purpo&s;es a&s;ore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill read $span$</NOTE> UPON this Di&s;cour&s;e, by a per&s;on of the King's &s;worn Council, the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Bill was read; but with &s;o univer&s;al a Di&s;like, that it was never call'd upon the Second time, but &s;lept, till long after the matter of it was di|ge&s;ted in Ordinances.</P>
<P>THE peremptory day again drawing very near, for the King's jour|ney into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and very little done towards the Publick, &s;ince the time they had prevail'd with his Maje&s;ty to &s;u&s;pend it, On a <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the Afternoon (the Progre&s;s being to begin on <HI>Monday)</HI> They again fell into violent Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the King's going into <HI>Scotland:</HI> the which they thought of &s;o great importance to be hinder'd, that they re|&s;olv'd (and prevail'd with the Lords to do the like) to Sit the next <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> day, being <HI>Sunday;</HI> which had &s;carce ever before been known, &s;ince the fir&s;t in&s;titution of Parliaments; and which they thought fit to excu&s;e by a &s;hort Declaration, that the People might not be thereby encou|raged to Prophane the Sabbath.</P>
<P>WHEN they found the King con&s;tant to his former Re&s;olution, and that all They could alledge could prevail no farther with him, than, whereas he intended to go on <HI>Monday</HI> after dinner, to &s;tay till <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI> morning, They very earne&s;tly propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that He would leave a Commi&s;&s;ion with &s;ome Per&s;ons, to Pa&s;s &s;uch Acts as &s;hould be pre|pared and pa&s;s both Hou&s;es in his ab&s;ence&punc; and to make a <HI>Cu&s;tos Regni,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"> to &s;upply the place of Government till his return:</Q> with many other Extravagances, which Them&s;elves under&s;tood not.

THE unexpected Pa&s;&s;ion and Importunity to hinder his Maje&s;ty's journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> was not well under&s;tood; and the le&s;s, for that the Governing Party was divided upon it: Some of them, with trouble equal to what they had at any time expre&s;s'd, in&s;i&s;ting upon his not going; Others alledging, <Q>&startq;&endq;that his Maje&s;ty was &s;o far engaged in it, that he could not in honour recede from it:</Q> Whil&s;t the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;|&s;ioners, who were often appeal&punc;d and referr'd to in the Debate, an|&s;wer'd &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly, as argued rather a conveniency, and expectation of the Journey it &s;elf, than any nece&s;&s;ity in point of time. Neither <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> was the ground of his Maje&s;ty's &s;o po&s;itive and unalterable re&s;olution of going thither, &s;ufficiently clear to Standers by; who thought he might have tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s of that Kingdom (where he could not rea|&s;onably expect any great reverence to his Per&s;on) better at a di&s;tance; and that his Pre&s;ence might be more nece&s;&s;ary in This.</P>
<P>BUT, as his Maje&s;ty's impatiency to &s;ee both Arm$es disbanded, and this Kingdom freed from the Inva&s;ion (both which he heartily de|&s;ired and his de&s;ire to refre&s;h him&s;elf, from the vexation which the Two Hou&s;es, or One of them, or Some in one of them, daily gave him; hurried him to that Expedition, without well weighing and preparing <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> how to comport him&s;elf through it: So no doubt, that oppo&s;ition and in&s;tance again&s;t it (be&s;ides the continued de&s;ire they had to remove the King from any fix'd re&s;olution) was de&s;ign'd partly, to procure an excu&s;e for the ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;ing the Bill of Pacification; which they had pur|po&s;ely retarded (fore&s;eeing there were many particulars in it, that if weigh'd, would never have been con&s;ented to) till they might be &s;o &s;traitned in time, that who&s;oever objected again&s;t what was offer&punc;d, might &s;eem to hinder the Disbanding, and to nece&s;&s;itate the King's longer &s;tay: but principally they hoped, that his Maje&s;ty, rather than defer his Journey on which he was re&s;olv'd, would con&s;ent to any unrea&s;ona|ble <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> qualifying Such per&s;ons whom They &s;hould name, with Power in his ab&s;ence: and moreover probably there was &s;ome real Jealou&s;y of the <HI>Scots</HI> at that time, and between the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners them|&s;elves (as was conceiv'd by &s;ome) by rea&s;on of great addre&s;&s;es made to the King by the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> the principal and governing per&s;on of that Nation, and &s;ome in&s;inuation of favour from his Maje&s;ty to him; &s;o that they did in earne&s;t de&s;ire to put off that Journey, for fear of di|&s;turbance There.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the King was well &s;atisfied with the Promi&s;es made to him by that Earl; who de&s;ired to live in this Court, and was to have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> been &s;hortly made Gentleman of the Bed chamber, and was in hope to marry a great and wealthy Lady: And it is certain, the King ex|pected, by His help and intere&s;t, to have found &s;uch a Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as would have been more tender of His honour than they after expre&s;s'd them&s;elves; and did allways impute the failing thereof to the ab&s;ence of that Earl, who being &s;ick at the King's going from <HI>London,</HI> within &s;ix weeks after died. But Others believ'd, He had been &s;o far guilty of what had been done ami&s;s, that he would neither have been able, nor willing, to pre&s;erve the foundation of that Power, which might hardly have forgotten by what means it had been oppre&s;s'd.</P>

The King perceiving that he was not now like to have any u&s;e of the new Army in <HI>Ireland;</HI> at lea&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="2420">
not that u&s;e for which it was rai&s;ed (which was, to have vi&s;ited <HI>Scot|land&punc;</HI> and finding often mention, enviou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly, made of that Army, in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and having from thence (by the advice of the Committee for <HI>Ireland)</HI> receiv&punc;d &s;ome Addre&s;&s;es for that pur$$&s;e; re&s;olv&punc;d to Disband them: and to that end, &s;ignified his Plea|&s;ure to the Lords Ju&s;tices of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> his L$evt$nant&punc;General of that Army; directing withall (according to the la&s;t ad$ice he had receiv&punc;d from the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that any Of|ficers of the Army, &s;hould have free leave to tran&s;port what men they could get of that Army, for the &s;ervice of any Prince in amity with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> this Crown:</Q> and &s;hortly after, upon the earne&s;t de&s;ire of <HI>Don Alon|&s;o de Cardenas,</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Maje&s;ty con|&s;ented, that four thou&s;and Soldiers of that Army &s;hould be tran&s;ported for the &s;ervice of that King into <HI>Flanders;</HI> at the &s;ame time permit|ting as many as de&s;ired the &s;ame, to be tran&s;ported for the &s;ervice of the <HI>French</HI> King. This was no &s;ooner known, but the Hou&s;e of Commons interpo&s;ed, with their accu&s;tom&punc;d confidence and di&s;temper, <Q>&startq;&endq;to be|&s;eech his Maje&s;ty to revoke that Licence;</Q> and, by impertinent and &s;light rea&s;ons, boldly urged and in&s;i&s;ted on, as they did in every thing el&s;e, prevail&punc;d with the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;to inhibit the tran&s;porting any of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Soldiers out of that Kingdom, for the &s;ervice of any Prince what|&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>MANY were of opinion that this activity in a bu&s;ine&s;s of which They had not the lea&s;t connu&s;ance, proceeded from the in&s;tigation of the Emba&s;&s;ador of the <HI>French</HI> King; who was very conver&s;ant with the principal per&s;ons of that Faction, and no doubt $omented tho&s;e humors out of which the Publick Calamities were bred; and &s;ome &s;aid bold|ly, and one or two have &s;ince affirm'd it, as upon their knowledge, <Q>&startq;&endq;that M^$ <HI>Pym</HI> receiv&punc;d five thou&s;and pound from that <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter, to hinder that Supply to <HI>Spain.</HI></Q> Others believ&punc;d, that it proceeded <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> only from that proud and petulant &s;pirit which po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them, to le&s;&s;en the reputation of the King&punc; and to let the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and all other Princes &s;ee the Power They had, to oppo&s;e and cro&s;s His re&s;olutions in the mo&s;t pure acts of Soveraignty. But I believe, though there might be a mixture of Both the other rea&s;ons, the principal motive that induced them to that Interpo&s;ition, was the advice and de&s;ire of the Committee from the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e coun&s;el was entire|ly follow'd in What&s;oever concern&punc;d that Kingdom; and who no doubt might have &s;ome Pro&s;pect of the Rebellion that &s;hortly after broke out, which could hardly have taken effect, it that Body of men had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> been removed out of the Kingdom, according to the King's direction.

<P>BUT of late, it cannot be denied, that, by the great Power of &s;ome Bi&s;hops at Court, it had much overflow'd the Banks which &s;hould have contain'd it; not only in meddling with things that intruth were not properly within Their connu&s;ance; but extending their Sentences and Judgements in matters tryable before them, beyond that degree that was Ju&s;tifiable; and grew to have &s;o great a Contempt of the Common Law, and the Profe&s;&s;ors of it (which was a Fatal Unskilfulne&s;s in the Bi&s;hops, who could never have Suffer'd whil&s;t the Common Law had been Pre&s;erv'd) that Prohibitions from the Supream Courts of Law, <MILESTONE N="5$" UNIT="line"> which have, and r$u&s;t have, the Superintendency over all Inferior Courts, were not only Neglected, but the Judges Reprehended for granting them (which without Perjury They could not deny) and the Lawyers Di&s;countenanced for moving for them (which They were

<P>DuRING the time of the King's abode at <HI>York,</HI> which was not many days, the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> Lord General, made a &s;uit to him for the making a Baron; which, at that time, might have been worth to him ten thou&s;and pounds, Whether the King apprehended the making an unfit man, who might di&s;&s;erve him in the Hou&s;e of Peers; or whether <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> he re&s;olv'd to contain him&s;elf from enlarging that number, except upon an extraordinary relation to his Own Service; I know not: but he thought not fit, at that time, to gratify the Earl: by which He took him&s;elf to be highly Di&s;obliged (as the Courtiers of that time look'd upon what&s;oever was Denied to them, as Taken from them) and having receiv'd &s;ome Information, from S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley</HI> and S^r <HI>John Coniers,</HI> of &s;ome Idle Pa&s;&s;ages in the late tampering with the Army to Petition, which had not been before heard of; a&s;&s;oon as the King was gone to|wards <HI>Scotland</HI> (though his Maje&s;ty hath &s;ince told me, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he thought

<P>IN all Debates of this nature, where the Law, Rea&s;on, and Common Sen&s;e, were directly Oppo&s;ite to what they propo&s;ed, They &s;uffer'd Tho&s;e who differ'd from them in opinion, and purpo&s;es, to &s;ay what they thought fit in oppo&s;ition; and then, without vouch&s;afing to endea|vour their &s;atisfaction, call'd importunately for the Que&s;tion; well knowing, that They had a Plurality of Voices to concur with them, in what&s;oever they de&s;ired.

<P>IN con&s;ideration of the King's nece&s;&s;ary Ab&s;ence from that his Native Kingdom, it was thought fit, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Full and Ab&s;olute Govern|ment thereof, &s;hould be committed to the Lords of the Secret Coun|cil; who were likewi&s;e made "Con&s;ervators of the Peace of the two Kingdoms, during the intervals of Parliaments;</Q> and tho&s;e Lords, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Con&s;ervators, <Q>&startq;&endq;were then, and &s;till, to be named by Parliament; which was once in three years to a&s;&s;emble upon a day certain, without any Summons from the King,</Q> if $e neglected to publi&s;h &s;uch Summons; and, upon the &s;ame rea&s;on, <Q>&startq;&endq;all great Officers, as Chancellor, Trea|&s;urer&punc; Secretary, and the re&s;t, nominated by Parliament; and in the in|ter$al by the Lords of the Secret Council;</Q> without &s;o much as be|ing concern'd to have his Maje&s;ty's approbation.</P>
<P>ALL which Acts, and what&s;oever el&s;e They were plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent to him, concerning Church or State, the King confirm'd; and there|by, made the Lord <HI>Lowden,</HI> who had been the Principal Manager of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the Rebellion, Chancellor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and created him likewi&s;e an Earl; and conferr'd the other great Offices, as he was directed: Then, he made the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> (for he was &s;till tru&s;ted with conferring of Ho|nours$ Marquis; Their great General, <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leven;</HI> and their Lieutenant-General, Earl of <HI>Calender;</HI> and conferr'd other Honours on Per&s;ons, according to the capacity and ability they had in doing him Mi&s;chief: And la&s;tly (leaving all his Own Party barely to Live; for he had procured a Pardon for them from the Parliament, upon condi|tion <Q>&startq;&endq;They came not near the King's pre&s;ence; nor receiv'd any Be|nefit from him;</Q> without Their approbation) his Maje&s;ty gave all the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Lands of the Church&punc; which had been devolv'd to Him by Its ruin; and what&s;oever He had el&s;e to give, in that Kingdom; to Tho&s;e, who had di&s;cover'd it not to be in good hands before: So that he &s;eem'd to have made that Progre&s;s into <HI>Scotland,</HI> only that he might make a perfect Deed of Gift of that Kingdom; which he could never have done, &s;o ab|&s;olutely, without going thither.

<P>IT is not to be doubted, in con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Extravagant Con|ce&s;&s;ions, They made as Extravagant Promi&s;es to the King; That by <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Their Loyal and Dutiful comportment, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould find no dimi|nution of his Power: That He &s;hould have the entire obedience of that Nation, to pre&s;erve his full Rights and Regalities in <HI>England;</HI> and to reduce <HI>Ireland:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> telling him (as Marquis <HI>Hamilton</HI> a&s;&s;ured me; in His hearing) <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would not only never more &s;erve Again&s;t him; but that whenever his Maje&s;ty would require his Service, He &s;hould have it;</Q> without ever asking what the cau&s;e was.

<P>BUT his Maje&s;ty never con&s;ider'd, or not &s;oon enough, that They could not rea&s;onably hope to keep, what they had &s;o ill got, but by the &s;ame arts by which they were &s;uch gainers; and there cannot be a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;urer evidence of the Continuance of an Enemy, than the having receiv'd Injuries from him, of a nature that do not u&s;e to be forgiven.

<P>AND by the&s;e, and the like arts, They promi&s;ed them&s;elves that they &s;hould ea&s;ily carry it: So that the day it was to be re&s;umed, They entertain'd the Hou&s;e all the morning with other Debates, and towards noon call'd for the Remon&s;trance; and it being urged by &s;ome, <Q>&startq;&endq;that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> it was too late to enter upon it, with much difficulty they con&s;ented, that it &s;hould be entred upon the next morning at nine of the Clock; and every clau&s;e &s;hould be Debated,</Q> the Speaker in the Chair; for They would not have the Hou&s;e re&s;olv'd into a Committee, which they believ'd would &s;pend too much time. <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> (who, at that time, was little taken notice of) ask'd the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;Why he would have it put off,</Q> for that day would quickly have determin'd it?

<P>UPON this encouragement, all the Factious and Schi&s;matical People <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> about the City and Suburbs, a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together with great licence; and would frequently, as well in the night as the day, convene them&s;elves, by the &s;ound of a Bell, or other token, in the Fields, or &s;ome convenient place, to con&s;ult, and receive Orders from Tho&s;e by whom they were to be di&s;po&s;ed.

<P>ALL this time the King (who had been with great Solemnity invited by the City of <HI>London,</HI> and de&s;ired to make his Re&s;idence nearer to Them than <HI>Hampton-Court)</HI> was at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> where, be&s;ides his or|dinary Retinue, and menial Servants, many Officers of the late Di&s;|banded Army, who Sollicited Their remainder of Pay from the Two Hou&s;es, which was &s;ecured to Them by Act of Parliament, and expected &s;ome farther imployment in the War with <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon ob&s;ervation, and view of the In&s;olence of the Tumults, and the Danger, that they might po&s;&s;ibly bring to the Court, offer'd them&s;elves for a Guard to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Officers Repell the Rabble about <HI>White-Hall.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on; and were with more Formality, and Ceremony entertained by Him, than upon a ju&s;t computation of all di&s;tempers, was by many conceived Sea&s;onable.

<P>THE Hou&s;e of Commons being at this time without any Member, who having Relation to the King's Service, would expre&s;s any Zeal for it, and could take upon him to &s;ay to others, whom he would tru&s;t, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> what the King de&s;ired, or to whom they, who wi&s;hed well, could re|&s;ort for advice, and direction; &s;o that whil&s;t there was a &s;trong Con|junction, and Combination to di&s;turb the Government by depraving it, whatever was &s;aid or done to Support it, was as if it were done by chance, and by the private dictates of the rea&s;on of private men; the King Re|&s;olved<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lr d <HI>Falkland</HI> made Sec$e|tary of State, and S^$ <HI>J$hn Colep$$per</HI> C$ancellor of $span$.</NOTE> to call the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> who was Knight of the Shire for <HI>Kent,</HI> to his Council; and to make the former Secretary of State in the place of <HI>Vane,</HI> that had been kept vacant; and the latter Chancellor of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which Office the Lord <HI>Cotting|ton</HI> had Re&s;igned, that M^r <HI>Pym</HI> might be put into it, when the Earl of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <HI>Bedford</HI> &s;hould have been Trea&s;urer, as is mention'd before. They were Both of great Authority in the Hou&s;e; neither of them of any re|lation to the Court; and therefore what They &s;aid made the more Im|pre&s;&s;ion; and They were frequent Speakers. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was
<PB N="268" REF="2880">
wonderfully beloved by all who knew him, as a man of Excellent Parts, of a Wit &s;o Sharp, and a Nature &s;o Sincere, that nothing could be more Lovely. The Other was generally e&s;teemed as a good Speaker, being a man of an Univer&s;al Under&s;tanding, a Quick Comprehen&s;ion, a Won|derful Memory, who commonly Spoke at the end of the Debate; when he would recollect all that had been &s;aid of Weight on all &s;ides with great exactne&s;s, and expre&s;s his own Sen&s;e with much clearne&s;s, and &s;uch an application to the Hou&s;e, that no man more gathered a general Concurrence to his Opinion than he; which was the more notable, be|cau&s;e his Per&s;on, and manner of Speaking were ungracious enough; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;o that He prevailed only by the &s;trength of his Rea&s;on, which was inforced with Confidence enough.</P>
<P>THE King knew Them to be of good E&s;teem in the Hou&s;e, and good Affections to his Service, and the quiet of the Kingdom; and was more ea&s;ily per&s;waded to be&s;tow tho&s;e Preferments upon Them, than the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was to accept that which was de&s;igned to him. No mancould be more Surprized than He was, when the fir&s;t Intimation was made to him of the King's purpo&s;e: He had never propo&s;ed any Such thing to him&s;elf, nor had any Veneration for the Court, but only Such a Loyalty to the King as the Law required from him. And He had naturally a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Wonderful Reverence for Parliaments, as believing them mo&s;t Solli|citous for Ju&s;tice, the Violation whereof in the lea&s;t degree he could not forgive any Mortal Power: and it was only his Ob&s;ervation of the Di&s;in|genuity, and want of Integrity in this Parliament, which le&s;&s;ened that Reverence to it, and had di&s;po&s;ed him to cro&s;s, and oppo&s;e Their de&s;igns: He was &s;o totally unacquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s, and the forms of it, that He did believe really he could not Execute the Office with any Sufficien|cy. But there were Two Con&s;iderations that made mo&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion upon him; the One, le&s;t the world &s;hould believe, that his own Ambition had procured this Promotion, and that he had therefore appeared Signally <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in the Hou&s;e to Oppo&s;e tho&s;e Proceedings, that he might thereby ren|der him&s;elf gracious to the Court: The Other, le&s;t the King &s;hould expect &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion, and Re&s;ignation of him&s;elf, and his own rea|&s;on, and judgment to his Commands, as he &s;hould never give, or pre|tend to give; for he was &s;o &s;evere an adorer of Truth, that he could as ea&s;ily have given him&s;elf leave to Steal as to Di&s;&s;emble; or to Suf|fer any Man to think that he would do any thing, which he Re&s;olved not to do; which he thought a more mi&s;cheivous kind of lying, than a po&s;itive averring, what could be mo&s;t ea&s;ily contradicted.</P>
<P>IT was a very difficult task to M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> who had mo&s;t credit with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Him, to per&s;wade Him to Submit to this purpo&s;e of the King's chear|fully, and with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Obligation, by Promi&s;ing that in tho&s;e Parts of the Office, which required mo&s;t Drudgery, he would help him the be&s;t he could. But above all he prevailed with him, by inforcing the Ill con&s;equence of his refu&s;al to take the Office, which would be inter|preted to his di&s;like of the Court, and his Opinion, that more would be required from him than he could Hone&s;tly comply with, which would bring great Prejudice to the King. On the other hand, the great Benefit that probably would redound to the King, and the Kingdom, by his accepting &s;uch a Tru&s;t in &s;uch a general defection, by which he <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> would have opportunity to give the King a truer Information of his own Condition, and the State of the Kingdom, than it might be pre&s;umed had been given to him, and to prevent any Coun&s;els or Practice, which
<PB N="269" REF="2890">
might more alienate the affections of the People from the Government; and then, that by this Relation He would be more able to do the King Service in the Hou&s;e, where He was too well known to have it believed, that He Attained to it by any unworthy Means or Application. In the end, He was per&s;waded to Submit to the King's good Plea&s;ure, tho' he could not be prevailed with to accept it with &s;o good a grace, as might rai&s;e in the King any Notable Expectation of his departing from the Severity of his own Nature.</P>
<P>THUS, He and <HI>Colepepper</HI> were both inve&s;ted in tho&s;e Offices, to the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> no &s;mall di&s;plea&s;ure of the Governing Party, which could not di&s;&s;emble their Indignation, that any of Their Members &s;hould Pre&s;ume to re|ceive tho&s;e Preferments, which they had de&s;igned otherwi&s;e to have di&s;po&s;ed of. They took all opportunities to expre&s;s their di&s;like of Them, and to Oppo&s;e any thing they Propo&s;ed to Them. And within few days there came a Letter out in Print, pretended to be Intercepted, as written from a Roman Catholick to another of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, in which he gives an account, <Q>&startq;&endq;That They had at la&s;t, by the intere&s;t of their Friends, procured tho&s;e two Honourable Per&s;ons (before men|tioned) "to be preferred to tho&s;e Offices, and that they were well a&s;|&s;ured <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> that they would be ready to do Them, and all their Friends, all good Offices.</Q> S^r <HI>John Colepepper</HI> thought fit to take notice of it in the Hou&s;e, and to make tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions of his Religion, which he thought nece&s;&s;ary. But the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> cho&s;e rather to Contemn it, with|out taking notice of the Libell, well knowing that he was Superior to tho&s;e Calumnies, as indeed he was; all of that Profe&s;&s;ion knowing that He was mo&s;t Irreconcilable to their Doctrine, tho' He was always Ci|vil to their Per&s;ons. However grievous this Preferment was to the angry part of the Hou&s;e, it was very grateful to all tho&s;e, both within and without the Hou&s;e, who wi&s;hed well to the King, and the Kingdom.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> THE King at the &s;ame time Re&s;olved to remove another Officer, who did di&s;&s;erve him notoriou&s;ly, and to Prefer M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> to that place, with which his Gracious intentions his Maje&s;ty acquainted him, but he po&s;itively refu&s;ed it, and a&s;&s;ured him, <Q>&startq;&endq;That He &s;hould be able to do much more Service in the condition he was in, than he &s;hould be, if that were improved by any Preferment, that could be conferred upon him at that time; and he added, "that he had the Honour to have much Friend&s;hip with the two Per&s;ons, who were very Sea&s;ona|bly advanced by his Maje&s;ty, when his Maje&s;tys Service in the Hou&s;e of Commons, did intruth want &s;ome Countenance, and Support; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> by his conver&s;ation with Them, he &s;hould be &s;o well in&s;tructed by Them, that he &s;hould be more u&s;eful to his Maje&s;ty, than if it were under a nearer relation and dependence. The King, with a very Gra|cious Countenance, told him, "that he perceived he mu&s;t, for &s;ometime, defer the laying any Obligation upon him; but bid him be a&s;&s;ured he would find both a Proper Time, and a Suitable Preferment for him, which he &s;hould not refu&s;e. In the mean time, he &s;aid, he knew well the Friend&s;hip between the two Per&s;ons, whom he had taken to his Council, and him; which was not the lea&s;t motive to him to make that choice; and that he would depend as much upon His Advice, as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> upon either of Theirs; and therefore wi&s;hed that all Three would Con|fer together, how to Conduct his Service in the Hou&s;e, and to advi&s;e his Friends how to carry them&s;elves mo&s;t to the advantage of it, and to give him con&s;tant Adverti&s;ement of what had Pa&s;&s;ed, and Coun&s;el
<PB N="270" REF="2900">
when it was fit for him to do any thing; and Declared, that He would do nothing, that in any degree concerned, or related to his Service in the Hou&s;e of Commons, without their joynt Advice, and exact Communication to them of all his own Conceptions;</Q> which, without doubt, his Maje&s;ty did at that time &s;tedfa&s;tly Re&s;olve, tho' in very few days he did very Fatally &s;werve from it.</P>
<P>BY what hath been &s;aid before, it appears that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was much tru&s;ted by the King, and he was of great familiarity, and friend|&s;hip with the other Three, at lea&s;t with Two of Them; for he was not a Man of that Exactne&s;s, as to be in the entire Confidence of the Lord <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <HI>Falkland,</HI> who looked upon his infirmities with more Severity than the other Two did; and he liv'd with more Frankne&s;s towards tho&s;e Two, than he did towards the Other: Yet even between tho&s;e two there was a free Conver&s;ation, and Kindne&s;s to each other. The Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was a man of very Extraordinary parts by Nature and Art, and had &s;urely as good and excellent an Education as any man of that Age in any Coun|try: A Graceful and Beautiful Per&s;on; of great Eloquence and Becom|ingne&s;s in his di&s;cour&s;e &s;ave that &s;ometimes he &s;eemed a little affected) and of &s;o Univer&s;al a Knowledge, that he never wanted Subject for a di&s;|cour&s;e: He was equal to a very good part in the greate&s;t Affairs, but the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> unfitte&s;t man alive to conduct them, having an ambition, and vanity Superior to all his other parts, and a confidence in him&s;elf, which &s;ome|times intoxicated, and tran&s;ported, and expo&s;ed him. He had from his Youth, by the di&s;obligations his Family had undergone from the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the great men who &s;ucceeded him, and &s;ome &s;harp reprehen&s;ion him&s;elf had met with, which obliged him to a Country Life, contracted a prejudice, and ill will to the Court; and &s;o had in the beginning of the Parliament, engaged him&s;elf with that Party, which di&s;covered mo&s;t aver&s;ion from it, with a Pa&s;&s;ion and Animo&s;ity equal to theirs, and therefore very acceptable to Them. But when he was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> weary of their violent Coun&s;els, and withdrew him&s;elf from them with &s;ome circum&s;tances, which enough provoked them, and made a Re|conciliation, and mutual Confidence in each other for the future, mani|fe&s;tly impo&s;&s;ible among&s;t them; he made private and &s;ecret offers of his Service to the King, to whom in &s;o general a defection of his Ser|vants, it could not but be very agreeable; and &s;o his Maje&s;ty being &s;a|tisfied both in the Di&s;coveries he made of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and in his Profe&s;&s;ions for the future, removed him from the Hou&s;e of Commons, where he had rendred him&s;elf marvellou&s;ly ungracious, and called him by Writ to the Hou&s;e of Peers, where he did vi&s;ibly Advance the King's <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Service, and quickly rendred him&s;elf grateful to all tho&s;e, who had not thought too well of him before, when he de&s;erved le&s;s; and men were not only plea&s;ed with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave upon all Debates, by his Judgment and Vivacity, but looked upon him, as one, who could de|rive the King's Plea&s;ure to them, and make a lively repre&s;entation of their good demeanour to the King, which he was very luxuriant in pro|mi&s;ing to do, and officious enough in doing as much as was Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>HE had been in&s;trumental in promoting the Three Per&s;ons above mentioned to the King's favour; and had him&s;elf intruth &s;o great an E&s;teem of them, that he did very frequently, upon Conference toge|ther, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> depart from his own Inclinations and Opinions, and Concurred in Theirs; and very few men of &s;o great parts were, upon all occa&s;ions, more Coun&s;ellable than he; &s;o that he would &s;eldom be in danger of running
<PB N="271" REF="2910">
into great Errors, if he would communicate, and expo&s;e all his own thoughts, and inclinations to &s;uch a di&s;qui&s;ition; nor was he uninclina|ble in his Nature to &s;uch an entire communication in all things, which he conceived to be difficult. But his Fatal infirmity was, that he too often thought difficult things very ea&s;y; and con&s;idered not po&s;&s;ible con|&s;equences, when the Propo&s;ition admini&s;tred &s;omewhat that was delight|ful to his Fancy, by pur&s;uing whereof he imagined he &s;hould reap &s;ome Glory to him&s;elf, of which he was immoderately Ambitious; So that if the con&s;ultation were upon any Action to be done, no man more impli|citly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> entred into that Debate, or more chearfully re&s;igned his own con|ceptions to a joynt determination: But when it was once affirmatively re&s;olved (be&s;ides that he might po&s;&s;ibly re&s;erve &s;ome impertinent cir|cum&s;tance, as he thought, the imparting whereof would change the na|ture of the thing) if his Fancy &s;ugge&s;ted to him any particular, which him&s;elf might perform in that Action, Upon the imagination that every body would approve it if it were propo&s;ed to them, he cho&s;e rather to Do it, than Communicate it, that he might have &s;ome Signal part to him&s;elf in the Tran&s;action, in which no other Per&s;on might claim a &s;hare.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> BY this unhappy temper he did often involve him&s;elf in very un|pro&s;perous Attempts. The King him&s;elf was the unfitte&s;t Per&s;on alive to be &s;erved by Such a Coun&s;ellor, being too ea&s;ily inclined to &s;uddain Enterprizes, and as ea&s;ily Startled when they were entred upon. And from this unhappy compo&s;ition in the One, and the Other, a very un|happy Coun&s;el was propo&s;ed, and re&s;olution taken, without the lea&s;t communication with either of the Three, who had been &s;o lately ad|mitted to an entire Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hops, who had been, in the manner before &s;poken of, driven, and kept from the Hou&s;e of Peers, and not very Secure in their own, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> could not have the patience to Attend the Di&s;&s;olution of this Storm, which in wi&s;dom They ought to have done: but con&s;idering Right and Rea&s;on too ab&s;tractly, and what in Ju&s;tice was due, not what in Pru|dence was to be expected; &s;uffer'd Them&s;elves implicitly to be guided by the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> who was of a re&s;tle&s;s, and overweening Spirit, to &s;uch an Act of indi&s;cretion, and di&s;advantage to Them&s;elves, that all their Enemies could not have brought upon Them. This Bi&s;hop, as it is &s;aid, was a man of a very Imperious and fiery Temper; D^r <HI>Williams,</HI> who had been Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> in the time of King <HI>James.</HI> After his removal from that Charge, He <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> had lived Splendidly in his Dioce&s;s, and made him&s;elf very popular among&s;t tho&s;e, who had no reverence for the Court; of which he would frequently, and in the pre&s;ence of many, &s;peak with too much Free|dom, and tell many Stories of Things and Per&s;ons upon his own former Experience; in which, being a man of great Pride and Vanity, He did not all ways confine him&s;elf to a preci&s;e Veracity, and did often pre&s;ume in tho&s;e unwary di&s;cour&s;es, to mention the Per&s;on of the King with too little Reverence. He did affect to be thought an Enemy to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> who&s;e Per&s;on he &s;eemed exceedingly to contemn, and to be much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e Ceremonies and Innovations, as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> they were then called, which were countenanced by the Other; and had him&s;elf publi&s;hed, by his own Authority, a Book again&s;t the u&s;ing tho&s;e Ceremonies, in which there was much good Learning, and too lit|tle Gravity for a Bi&s;hop. His Pa&s;&s;ion and his Levity, gave every day
<PB N="272" REF="2920">
great advantages to tho&s;e who did not love him, and He provoked too many, not to have tho&s;e advantages made u&s;e of: So that, after &s;everal Informations again&s;t Him in the Star-Camber, He was Sentenced, and Fined in a great &s;um of money to the King, and committed Pri&s;oner to the Tower, without the pity, or compa&s;&s;ion of any, but tho&s;e, who, out of hatred to the Government, were &s;orry that they were without &s;o u&s;eful a Champion; For He appeared to be a man of a very corrupt Nature, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions could have tran&s;ported Him into the mo&s;t un|ju&s;tifiable Actions.</P>
<P>HE had a Faculty of making relations of things done in his own <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Pre&s;ence, and di&s;cour&s;es made to him&s;elf, or in his own hearing, with all the circum&s;tances of an&s;wers, and replies, and upon Arguments of great Moment; all which, upon Examination, were &s;till found to have nothing in them, that was Real, but to be the pure effect of his own Invention. After He was Sentenced in the Star-Chamber, &s;ome of his Friends re&s;orted to him, to lament, and condole with him for his mi&s;|fortune, and &s;ome of them &s;eemed to wonder that in any Affair of &s;uch a Nature, He had not found means to have made &s;ome Submi&s;&s;ion, and Compo&s;ition, that might have prevented the publick Hearing, which proved &s;o much to his Prejudice in point of Reputation, as well as Pro|fit. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> He an&s;wered them with all the formality imaginable, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they had rea&s;on indeed to wonder at him upon the Event; but when they &s;hould know how he had governed him&s;elf, He believed they would cea&s;e to think him worthy of blame. And then related to them, "that a&s;&s;oon as Publication had pa&s;&s;ed in his Cau&s;e, and the Books were taken out, he had de&s;ired his Council (who were all able men, and &s;ome of them very Eminent) in the Vacation time, and they at mo&s;t lea&s;ure, to meet together, and carefully to look over, and peru&s;e all the Evidence, that was taken on Both &s;ides; and that then they would attend him &s;uch a morning, which he appointed upon their con&s;ent, at his own <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> That they came at the time appointed; and being then &s;hut up in a Room together, He asked them, whether they had &s;ufficiently peru&s;ed all the Books, and were throughly informed of his Ca&s;e? To which they all an&s;wered, that they had not only read them all over together, but had &s;everally every man by him&s;elf peru&s;ed them again, and they believed they were all informed of the whole. That He then told them he had de&s;ired this Conference with them, not only as his Council, by who&s;e opinion he meant to govern him&s;elf, but as his particular Friends, who, he was &s;ure, would give him their be&s;t Advice, and per&s;wade him to do every thing as they would do them|&s;elves, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> if They were in His Condition. That he was now offer'd to make his Peace at Court, by &s;uch an humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the King, as he was mo&s;t inclined, and ready to make; and which he would make the next day after his Cau&s;e was Heard, tho' he &s;hould be Declared to be Innocent, of which he could make no doubt; But that which troubled him, for the pre&s;ent, was, that the Infamou&s;ne&s;s of the Charge again&s;t him, which had been often Expo&s;ed, and Inlarged upon in &s;everal mo|tions, had been &s;o much taken notice of through the Kingdom, that it could not con&s;i&s;t with his Honour to divert the Hearing, which would be imputed to his want of Confidence in his Innocence, &s;ince men did <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> not &s;u&s;pect his Courage, if he dur&s;t rely upon the other; but that he was Re&s;olved, as he &s;aid before, the next day after he &s;hould be Vindi|cated from tho&s;e Odious A&s;per&s;ions, he would ca&s;t him&s;elf at the King's
<PB N="273" REF="2930">
feet, with all the humility, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which the mo&s;t Guilty man could make profe&s;&s;ion of. It was in this point he de&s;ired their Advice, to which he would, without adhereing to his own Inclina|tion, entirely conform him&s;elf; and therefore de&s;ired them, Singly in order, to give him their Advice. He repeated the Several, and Di&s;tinct di&s;cour&s;e every man had made, in which he was &s;o Punctual, that he applied tho&s;e Phra&s;es, and Expre&s;&s;ions, and Manner of Speech to the Several men, which they were all taken notice of Frequently to u&s;e; as many men have &s;ome Peculiar Words in di&s;cour&s;e, which they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> are mo&s;t delighted with, or by cu&s;tom mo&s;t addicted to: and in Con|clu&s;ion, that they were Unanimous in their judgments; that he could not, with the pre&s;ervation of his Honour, and the opinion of his Integrity, decline the Publick Hearing; where he mu&s;t be un|que&s;tionably declared innocent; there being no Crime, or Mi&s;d$mea|nour proved again&s;t him in Such a manner, as could make him liable to Cen&s;ure: they All commended his re&s;olution of Submitting to the King a&s;&s;oon as he had made his Innocence to appear; and they All advi&s;ed him to pur&s;ue that Method. This, he &s;aid, had S$$yed him: and made him decline the Other Expedient, that had been pro|po&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Relation wrought upon Tho&s;e, to whom it was made, to rai&s;e a Prejudice in them again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e, or the Reputation of the Council, as they were mo&s;t inclined; whereas there was not indeed the lea&s;t &s;hadow of Truth in the whole Relation; except that there was Such a Meeting, and Conference, as was mentioned, and which had been con&s;ented to by the Bi&s;hop upon the joint de&s;ire, and importunity of all the Council; Who, at that Conference, Unan$mou&s;ly advi&s;ed and de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;&endq;to u&s;e all the Means and Friends he could, that the Cau&s;e might Not be brought to Hearing: but that he &s;hould <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> purcha&s;e his Peace at any Price; for that if it were Heard, he would be Sentenced very grievou&s;ly; and that there were many things Proved again&s;t him, which would &s;o much reflect upon his Honour, and Reputation, and the more for being a Bi&s;hop, that all his Friends would abandon him; and be for ever after A&s;hamed to appear on his behalf. Which Advice with great Pa&s;&s;ion,</Q> and Reproaches upon the Several Per&s;ons for their pre&s;umption, and ignorance in matters &s;o much above Them, he utterly and Scornfully rejected. Nor indeed was it po&s;&s;ible, at that time, for him to have made his Peace; for tho', upon &s;ome former Addre&s;&s;es, and Importunity on his behalf by &s;ome <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Per&s;ons of Power, and Place in the Court, in which the Queen her &s;elf had endeavoured to have done him good Offices, the King was inclined to have &s;aved him, being a Bi&s;hop, from the Infamy he mu&s;t undergo by a Publick Trial; yet the Bi&s;hops Vanity had, in tho&s;e conjunctures, &s;o far tran&s;ported him, that he had done all he could to have in&s;inuated, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Court was a&s;hamed of what they had done; and had pre|vailed with &s;ome of his Powerful Friends to per&s;wade him to that compo&s;ition:</Q> upon which the King would never hear more Any per|&s;on, who Moved on His behalf.</P>
<P>IT had been once mentioned to Him, whether by Authority, or no, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> was not known, <Q>&startq;&endq;that his Peace &s;hould be made, if he would re&s;ign his Bi&s;hoprick, and Deanery of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> (for he had That in Com|mendam) "and take a good Bi&s;hoprick in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which he po&s;itively refu&s;ed; and &s;aid, "he had much to do to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the
<PB N="274" REF="2940">
Arch-Bi&s;hop Here; but if he was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> There was a Man (mean|ing the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> who would cut off his Head within one Month.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Bi&s;hop had been for &s;ome years in the Tower, by the Sentence of the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> before this Parliament met; when the Lords, who were the mo&s;t Active and Powerful, pre&s;ently re&s;olved to have him at Liberty. Some had much Kindne&s;s for him; not only as a known Enemy to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> but as a Supporter of Tho&s;e Opinions and Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, which were again&s;t the Church it &s;elf. And he was no &s;ooner at Liberty, and brought into the Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> but, as has been before mention'd, he defended, and &s;econded the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> when he made an Invective with all the malice, and bitterne&s;s imaginable, again&s;t the Arch-Bi&s;hop then in Pri&s;on; and when he had concluded, that Bi&s;hop &s;aid; <Q>&startq;&endq;that he had long known that noble Lord, and had all ways believed him to be as well affected to the Church as Him&s;elf;</Q> and &s;o he continued to make all his Addre&s;s to that Lord, and Tho&s;e of the &s;ame party. Being now in full Liberty, and in &s;ome Credit, and Reputation, he applied him&s;elf to the King; and made all po&s;&s;ible profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to his Maje&s;ty, and Zeal to the Church; prote&s;ting <Q>&startq;&endq;to have a perfect Dete&s;tation of Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who ap|peared <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to have no Affection or Duty towards his Maje&s;ty, and of all evil intentions again&s;t the Religion E&s;tabli&s;h'd; and that the Civility he had expre&s;&s;ed towards them, was only out of gratitude for the good will They had &s;hewed to Him; and e&s;pecially that he might the bet|ter promote his Maje&s;tys Service.</Q> And it being his Turn &s;hortly after, as Dean of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to Preach before the King; he took oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak of the Factions in Religion; and mentioning the Presby|terian Di&s;cipline, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;it was a Government only fit for Taylors, and Shoemakers, and the like:</Q> not for Noblemen, and Gentlemen: which gave great Scandal, and Offence to his great Patrons; to whom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> he ea&s;ily reconciled him&s;elf, by making Them as merry with &s;ome Sharp Sayings of the Court, and by performing more Sub&s;tantial Offices for them.</P>
<P>WHEN, upon the Trial of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> it was re&s;olved to decline the Judgment of the Hou&s;e of Peers, and to proceed by Bill of Attainder; and there upon it was very unrea&s;onably Moved, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Bi&s;hops might have no Vote in the pa&s;&s;ing that Act of Parliament; becau&s;e they pretended it was to have their hand in Blood, which was again&s;t an old Canon;</Q> This Bi&s;hop, without communicating with any of his Brethren, very Frankly declared his opinion, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they ought <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> not to be pre&s;ent;</Q> and offered, not only in his own Name, but for the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops, <Q>&startq;&endq;to withdraw allways when That bu&s;ine&s;s was enter'd upon:</Q> and &s;o betrayed a Fundamental Right of the whole Or|der; to the great Prejudice of the King, and to the taking away the life of that Per&s;on, who could not otherwi&s;e have Suffer'd.</P>
<P>AND &s;hortly after, when the King declared, that he neither would, nor could in Con&s;cience, give his Royal A&s;&s;ent to that Act of Attainder; when the Tumults came about the Court with noi&s;e and clamour for Ju&s;tice; the Lord <HI>Say</HI> de&s;ired the King to confer with his Bi&s;hops for the Satisfaction of his Con&s;cience; and de&s;ired him to to &s;peak with That <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Bi&s;hop in the point. After much di&s;cour&s;e together, and the King in|&s;i&s;ting upon many particulars, which might induce others to con&s;ent; but were known to Him&s;elf to be Fal&s;e; and therefore he could never
<PB N="275" REF="2950">
in con&s;cience give his own con&s;ent to them; The Bi&s;hop, as hath been mentioned before, among&s;t other Arguments, told him; <Q>&startq;&endq;that he mu&s;t con&s;ider, that as he had a Private Capacity, and a Publick, &s;o he had a Publick Con&s;cience as well as a Private; that though his Pri|vate Con&s;cience, as a Man, would not permit him to do an Act con|trary to his own Under&s;tanding, Judgment, and Con&s;cience; yet his Publick Con&s;cience, as a King, which obliged him to do all things for the Good of his People, and to pre&s;erve his Kingdom in Peace for Him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity, would not only Permit him to do That, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> but even Oblige, and Require him. That he &s;aw in what Commo|tion the People were; that his own Life, and that of the Queens, and the Royal I&s;&s;ue might probably be Sacrificed to that Fury; and it would be very &s;trange, if his Con&s;cience &s;hould prefer the life of one Single Private Per&s;on how Innocent &s;oever, before all tho&s;e other Lives, and the pre&s;ervation of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the argumentation of that unhappy Ca&s;ui&s;t; who truely, it may be, did believe him&s;elf; for towards the end of the War, and when the King's power declined; he, being then an Arch-Bi&s;hop, did in Per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;t the Rebels to take a Ca&s;tle of the King's; in which there <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> was a Gari&s;on, and which was taken by a long Siege; becau&s;e he might thereby the better enjoy the Profits of his own E&s;tate, which lay thereabouts.</P>
<P>UPON all the&s;e great Services He had performed for the Party, he grew every day more Imperious; and after the King thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to make him Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> which, as the time then was, could not qualify him to do more harm, and might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;po&s;e, and oblige him to do &s;ome good; he carried him&s;elf &s;o In&s;olently, in the Hou&s;e and out of the Hou&s;e, to all per&s;ons, that he became much more Odious univer&s;ally, than ever the other Arch-Bi&s;hop had been; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> having &s;ure more Enemys than He, and few or no Friends, of which the Other had abundance. And the great hatred of this Man's Per&s;on and Behaviour, was the greate&s;t invitation to the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;o irregularly to Revive that Bill to remove the Bi&s;hops; and was their chief incouragement to hope, that the Lords, who had rejected the Former, would now Pa&s;s, and con&s;ent to this Second Bill.</P>
<P>THIS was one of the Bi&s;hops, who was mo&s;t rudely treated by the Rabble; who gathered them&s;elves together about the Hou&s;e of Peers, crying out <HI>No Bi&s;hops, No Bi&s;hops:</HI> and his Per&s;on was a&s;&s;aulted, and Robes torn from his back; upon which, in very ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, he re|turned <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to his hou&s;e, the Deanery at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> and &s;ent for all the Bi&s;hops, who were then in the Town (it being within very few days of <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s)</HI> of which there were Twelve or Thirteen; and, in much Pa&s;&s;ion, and with his Natural Indignation, he propo&s;ed as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; <Q>&startq;&endq;that they might Unanimou&s;ly, and Pre&s;ently prepare a Prote&s;tation, to &s;end to the Hou&s;e, again&s;t the Force, that was u&s;ed upon them; and again&s;t all the Acts, which were, or &s;hould be done during the time, that They &s;hould by Force be kept from doing their Dutys in the Hou&s;e.</Q> And Immediately, having Pen and Ink ready. Him&s;elf prepared a Prote&s;tation; which being read to them, they all <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> approved; depending upon His great experience in the Rules of the Hou&s;e, where he had &s;ate &s;o many years, and in &s;ome Parliaments in the place of Speaker, whil&s;t he was Keeper of the Great Seal; and &s;o pre&s;uming, that He could commit no errour in Matter or Form: and

without further communication, and advice, which both the Impor|tance of the Subject, and the Di&s;temper of the time did require; and that it might have been con&s;idered as well what was Fit, as what was Right; without further delay, than what was nece&s;&s;ary for the fair Writing, and Ingro&s;&s;ing the In&s;trument, they had prepared; they all &s;et their hands to it. Then the Arch-Bi&s;hop went to <HI>White-Hall</HI> to the King, and pre&s;ented the Prote&s;tation to Him; it being directed to his Maje&s;ty with an Humble De&s;ire, that He would &s;end it to the Hou&s;e of Peers, &s;ince They could not pre&s;ent it Them&s;elves; and that he would command, that it &s;hould be Enter'd in the Journal of the Hou&s;e. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> His Maje&s;ty ca&s;ting his eye perfunctorily upon it, and believing it had been drawn by Mature Advice, no &s;ooner received it, than he delivered it to the Lord Keeper, who unfortunately happened to be likewi&s;e pre|&s;ent, with his command that he &s;hould deliver it to the Hou&s;e as &s;oon as it met: which was to be within two hours after.

<P>ASSOON as this Prote&s;tation, which, no doubt, in the time before the Hou&s;e was to meet, had been communicated to Tho&s;e who were prepared to &s;peak upon it, was Delivered by the Lord Keeper with his Maje&s;tys Command, and Read; the Governing Lords manife&s;ted a great <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Satisfaction in it; Some of them &s;aying, <Q>&startq;&endq;that there was <HI>`Digitus `Dei</HI> to bring That to pa&s;s, Which they could not Otherwi&s;e have com|pa&s;&s;ed;</Q> and without ever Declaring any Judgment or Opinion of their own upon it, which they ought to have done, the matter only having

<P>AND yet the Indi&s;cretion of Tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, &s;wayed by the Pride, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and Pa&s;&s;ion of that Arch-Bi&s;hop, in applying that Remedy at a time, when they &s;aw all Forms and Rules of Judgment impetuou&s;ly declined; and the power of their Adver&s;aries &s;o great, that the Laws them&s;elves &s;ubmitted to their Oppre&s;&s;ion; that They &s;hould, in Such a Storm, when the be&s;t Pilot was at his prayers, and the Card, and Compa&s;s lo&s;t, with|out the advice of one Mariner, put them&s;elves in &s;uch a Cock-boat, and to be &s;evered from the good Ship, gave that Scandal and Offence to all tho&s;e, who pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to pre&s;erve their Function, that they had no compa&s;&s;ion, or regard of their Per&s;ons, or what became of them; in&s;omuch as in the whole Debate in the Hou&s;e of Commons, there was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> only one Gentleman, who &s;poke on their behalfs, and &s;aid; <Q>&startq;&endq;he did not believe they were guilty of High-Trea&s;on, but that they were Stark Mad;</Q> and therefore de&s;ired they might be &s;ent to <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
<P>THIS high, and extravagant way of proceeding brought no Prejudice to the King; and tho' it made their Tribunal more terrible to men who laboured under any Guilt, yet it exceedingly le&s;&s;ened the Reve|rence and Veneration, that formerly had been entertained for Parlia|ments: and this la&s;t Accu&s;ation, and Commitment of &s;o many Bi&s;hops at Once, was looked upon by all Sober men with Indignation.

<P>THO' this Declaration had afterwards a very good influence upon the People, to his Maje&s;ty's advantage; yet for the pre&s;ent it gave no allay to their Di&s;tempers.

By the incredible increa&s;e of Trade, which the di&s;tra|ctions of other Countries, and the Peace of this brought, and by the great licence of re&s;ort thither, it was, &s;ince the King's acce&s;s to the Crown, in Riches, in People, in Buildings marvellou&s;ly increa&s;ed, in&s;omuch as the Suburbs were allmo&s;t equal to the City; a Reformation of which had been often in contemplation, never pur&s;ued, wi&s;e men fore&s;eeing that &s;uch a Fulne&s;s could not be there, without an Emptine&s;s in other places; and whil&s;t &s;o many per&s;ons of Honour and E&s;tates were &s;o de|lighted with the City, the Government of the Country mu&s;t be neglect|ed, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> be&s;ides the exce&s;s, and ill husbandry, that would be introduced there|by. But &s;uch fore&s;ight was interpreted a Moro&s;ity, and too great an oppre&s;&s;ion upon the Common Liberty; and &s;o, little was applied to pre|vent &s;o growing a Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>AS it had the&s;e, and many other advantages and helps to be Rich, &s;o it was looked upon too much of late time as a Common Stock not ea&s;y to be exhau&s;ted, and as a body not to be grieved by ordinary Acts of inju&s;tice; and therefore as it was a place of re&s;ort, in all ca&s;es of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, for the &s;uddain borrowing great &s;ums of money, in which they were commonly Merchants too good for the Crown, &s;o it was become a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> practice, upon any &s;pecious pretences, to void the Security, that was at any time given for money &s;o borrowed.</P>
<P>THUS after many que&s;tionings of their Charter, which were ever re|moved by con&s;iderable &s;ums of money, a Grant made by the King in the beginning of his Reign (in con&s;ideration of great &s;ums of money) of good quantities of Land in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of the City of <HI>Londonderry</HI> there, was voided by a Suit in the <HI>Star-Chamber;</HI> all the Lands, after a va&s;t expence in building and planting, re&s;umed into the King's hands, and a fine of Fifty Thou&s;and pounds impo&s;ed upon the City.

<P>THAT They might gratify the City in procuring a better An&s;wer, than they had received from the King to their Petition, and that they might more expo&s;e his Maje&s;ty to their Affronts, the Hou&s;e re&s;umed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Tower again, with the old reflections upon the removal of the former Good Lieutenant, and the putting in a rude per&s;on and of a de&s;perate fortune, as they called him, that he might u&s;e &s;uch Pri&s;oners, as there was an intent to &s;end thither, in &s;uch a manner, as he &s;hould be directed; and that the per&s;on, who was &s;ince put in, had put the City into great apprehen&s;ions by the ob&s;ervation that was made, that he took <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> great &s;tore of provi&s;ions into the Tower, as if he made provi&s;ion for a greater Gari&s;on, which rai&s;ed great jealou&s;ies; and there was a Petition brought, and delivered to the Hou&s;es in the Names of &s;everal Merchants, who u&s;ed to trade to the Mint; in which they de&s;ired that there might be &s;uch a per&s;on made Lieutenant of the Tower, <Q>&startq;&endq;as they could Con|fide in (an Expre&s;&s;ion that grew from that time to be much u&s;ed) with|out which no man would venture Bullion into the Mint,</Q> and by con|&s;equence no Merchant would bring it into the Kingdom.

<P>AND they declared, <Q>that the publi&s;hing the Articles of High-Trea|&s;on &startq;&endq;again&s;t the per&s;ons accu&s;ed, was a high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, a great Scandal to his Maje&s;ty, and his Government, a Seditious act manife&s;tly tending to the Subver&s;ion of the Peace of the Kingdom, and an injury, and di&s;honour to the Members; and that the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject &s;o violated and broken, could not be fully, and &s;ufficiently Vindicated, unle&s;s the King would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to di&s;cover the Names of tho&s;e per&s;ons, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> who advi&s;ed him to do the particular Acts before mentioned, that they might receive Condign Puni&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;trange Declaration, &s;o contrary to the known rules and judg|ments of Law, and to the known practice and proceedings of Parliament, was no &s;ooner framed and agreed upon in the Committee, than it was printed, and publi&s;hed throughout the City, and Kingdom, before it was Confirmed by, or Reported to the Hou&s;e; which is again&s;t the cu&s;tom of Parliament.

<P>THE truth is, it cannot be expre&s;&s;ed how great a Change there appear|ed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> to be in the countenance and minds of all &s;orts of People, in Town and Country, upon the&s;e late proceedings of the King. They, who had before even lo&s;t their Spirits, having lo&s;t their credit, and reputation, except among&s;t the meane&s;t people, who could never have been made
<PB N="296" REF="3160">
u&s;e of by them, when the greater &s;hould for&s;ake them; and &s;o de&s;paired of ever being able to compa&s;s their de&s;igns of Malice, or Ambition (and &s;ome of them had re&s;umed their old re&s;olutions of leaving the Kingdom) now again recovered greater Courage than ever, and quickly found that their credit and reputation was as great as ever it had been; the Court being reduced to a lower condition, and to more di&s;e&s;teem, and neglect than ever it had undergone. All that they had formerly &s;aid of Plots and con&s;piracies again&s;t the Parliament, which had Before been laughed at, was Now thought true and real; and all their fears, and jealou&s;ies looked upon as the effects of their great Wi&s;dom, and Fore&s;ight. All <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> that had been Whi&s;pered of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was now talked Aloud and Printed; as all other Seditious Pamphlets and Libels were. The Shops of the City generally &s;hut up, as if an Enemy were at their Gates ready to en|ter, and to plunder them; and the People in all places at a Gaze, as if they looked only for Directions, and were then di&s;po&s;ed to any un|dertaking.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, They, who had, with the greate&s;t courage and ala|crity, oppo&s;ed all their Seditious practi&s;es, between Grief and Anger were confounded with the con&s;ideration of what had been done, and what was like to follow. They were far from thinking that the accu&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Members had received much Wrong, yet they thought it an Un&s;ea&s;on|able time to call them to an Account for it. That if any thing had been to be done of that kind, there &s;hould have been a fitter choice of the Per&s;ons, there being many of the Hou&s;e, of more mi&s;chievous inclina|tions, and de&s;igns again&s;t the King's per&s;on, and the Government, and were more expo&s;ed to the Publick Prejudice, than the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> was; who was a Civil, and well natured man, and had rather kept ill Company, than drank deep of that infection and poi&s;on, that had wrought upon many others. Then S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerigg,</HI> and M^r <HI>Strode,</HI> were per&s;ons of too Low an account and e&s;teem; and tho' their Viru|lence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and Malice was as con&s;picuous, and tran&s;cendent as any man's, yet their reputation, and intere&s;t to do mi&s;chief otherwi&s;e than in con|curring in it, was &s;o &s;mall, that they gained credit and authority, by be|ing joined with the re&s;t, who had indeed a great Influence. However, &s;ince there was a re&s;olution to proceed again&s;t Tho&s;e men, it would have been much better to have cau&s;ed them to have been all Severally ar|re&s;ted, and &s;ent to the Tower, or to other Pri&s;ons, which might have been very ea&s;ily done before &s;u&s;pected, than to &s;end in that manner to the Hou&s;es with that Formality, which would be liable to &s;o many exceptions. At lea&s;t, they ought &s;o far to have imparted it to Members <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> in both Hou&s;es, who might have been tru&s;ted, that in the In&s;tant of the Accu&s;ation, when both Hou&s;es were in that Con&s;ternation (as in a great con&s;ternation they were) &s;omewhat might have been pre&s;&s;ed Confident|ly towards the King's &s;atisfaction; which would have produced &s;ome op|po&s;ition and contradiction, and might have prevented that Univer&s;al concurrence and dejection of Spirit, which &s;eized upon, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT above all, the anger, and indignation was very great and general, that to all the other over&s;ights and pre&s;umptions was added the expo&s;ing the Dignity, and Maje&s;ty, and Safety of the King, in his coming in Per|&s;on, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> in that manner, to the Hou&s;e of Commons; and in going the next day, as he did to the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> and to the Lord Mayors; which drew &s;uch Reproaches upon him to his Face. All which was ju&s;tly impur$d
<PB N="297" REF="3170">
to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who had before fewer true Friends than he de&s;erved, and had now allmo&s;t the whole Nation his Enemys, being the mo&s;t Uni|ver&s;ally odious of any man in it.</P>
<P>WHEN the Hou&s;e of Commons had Pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch Votes from the Com|mittee at <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall,</HI> as they thought nece&s;&s;ary, and had once more Adjourned thither, the Committee asked the advice of th$ Hou&s;e, whether the accu&s;ed Members might be pre&s;ent with them (who had intruth directed, and governed all their proceedings from the time they Sate there) which was not only approved, but tho&s;e Members re|quired <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to attend the Hou&s;e the next day it was to &s;it, and &s;o to continue the &s;ervice of the Hou&s;e, which was then Adjourned for three or four days, that the City might appear in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as &s;hould be thought convenient.</P>
<P>THE noi&s;e was &s;o great of the preparations made in the City to bring the accu&s;ed Members in Triumph to the Parliament, and that the whole Militia would accompany them, whil&s;t the Seamen and Mariners made an appearance in Barges, and other Ve&s;&s;els upon the <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> that the King thought it convenient to remove again from <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and &s;o on the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> which was the Eve to that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> great Fe&s;tival, his Maje&s;ty, the Queen, and the Royal Children, went from <HI>White-Hall</HI> to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> waited on by &s;ome few of their own Hou&s;hold Servants, and thirty or forty of tho&s;e Officers, who had attended at <HI>White-Hall</HI> for &s;ecurity again&s;t the tumults.</P>
<P>BEFORE His going, he &s;ent to the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> to at|tend him in this journey; who were both by their Places, the one being Lord Chamberlain of his Hou&s;hold, the other the fir&s;t Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber or Groom of the Stole, Obliged to that Duty. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> re&s;olved to go, and, to that purpo&s;e, was making him&s;elf ready, when the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to him, and privately di&s;&s;waded <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> him; a&s;&s;uring him, that if They two went, they &s;hould be both Mur|ther'd at <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> whereupon they left the King to his &s;mall retinue in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate, perplexed condition, in more need of com|fort and Coun&s;el, than they had ever known him; and in&s;tead of attend|ing their Ma&s;ter in that exigent, they went together into the City, where the Committee Sate, and where they were not the le&s;s welcome for be|ing known to have been invited to have waited upon their Maje&s;ties. They who wi&s;hed the King be&s;t, were not &s;orry that he Then with|drew from <HI>White&punc;Hall;</HI> for the in&s;olence, with which all that people were tran&s;ported, and the animo&s;ity, which was infu&s;ed into the hearts <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of the people in general again&s;t the Court, and even again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>FROM <HI>London</HI> bridge to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Thames</HI> was guarded with above a hunder'd Lighters and Longboats, laden with &s;mall pieces of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Ordinance, and dre&s;&s;ed up with Wa&s;t-cloaths and Streamers, as ready for Fight. And that the Train&punc;d-bands of <HI>London</HI> might be under the command of a per&s;on fit to lead them, they granted a Commi&s;&s;ion to Captain <HI>Skippon,</HI> who was Captain of the Artillery Garden, to be Major-General of the Militia of the City of <HI>London;</HI> an Office never before heard of, nor imagined that they had authority to con&s;titute.

<P>THIS man marched that day in the head of their tumultuary Army to the Parliament Hou&s;e; where the accu&s;ed Members were no &s;ooner enter&punc;d, than they magnified <Q>&startq;&endq;the great kindne&s;s and affection they had found in the City, and their zeal to the Parliament; and if their ex|pre&s;&s;ions <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of it, upon this extraordinary occa&s;ion, had been &s;omewhat unu&s;ual, that the Hou&s;e was ingaged in honour to Protect and defend them from receiving any damage.</Q> Whereupon the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> were called into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and thanked by the Speaker for their extraordinary care, and love expre&s;&s;ed to the Parliament; and told, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they &s;hould have an Ordinance of Parliament for their In|demnity, declaring that all their actions of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s, which they had &s;hew'd to the Lords and Commons in <HI>London,</HI> and their at|tending them to,</Q> and at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> was legal and ju&s;tifiable.

<P>ALL men were now in union in both Hou&s;es: the Lords had not yet recovered the courage to di&s;&s;ent in any one propo&s;ition made to them from the Commons; and in Their Hou&s;e no man dur&s;t pre&s;ume to De|bate the matter of Priviledge, how far it extended, and in what ca&s;es it was of no moment, le&s;t he might be thought to be privy to, and a Coun|&s;ellor of, that heinous breach, which had given them all this credit.

<P>AND in one day both Hou&s;es agreed in, and executed three Acts of Soveraignty, even of as high nature as any they have &s;ince ventured upon; the fir&s;t, <Q>&startq;&endq;in commanding the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> by, and with the advice of their new Serjeant-Major-General <HI>Skippon,</HI> to place a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Guard upon, that is to Be&s;iege the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to hinder the go|ing in of any provi&s;ions, or going out of any Arms or Ammunition;</Q> the &s;econd, "in appointing S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> to go to <HI>Hull,</HI> which will be mentioned anon; the third <Q>&startq;&endq;in &s;ending an Order to the Governour of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> that no body &s;hould be admitted into that town and fort, or &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s from thence, or any thing to be di&s;po&s;ed of there, but by order from the King &s;ignified by both Hou&s;es of Par|liament.</Q></P>

<P>FROM thence his Maje&s;ty &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence finds a Me&s;&s;age to both Hou$e$.</NOTE> took notice, that his proceedings again&s;t tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom he had accu&s;ed (naming them) were conceived by many to be Illegal, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> not agreeable to the Priviledge of Parliament, and that he was &s;o de|&s;irous to give &s;atisfaction to all men in all matters, that might &s;eem to have relation to Priviledge of Parliament, that he would wave his former proceedings; and all doubts being by that means &s;etled, when the minds of men were compo&s;ed, he would proceed again&s;t them in an unque&s;tionable way; and he a&s;&s;ured both Hou&s;es, that, upon all occa&s;ions, he would be as careful of their Priviledges as of his Life, or his Crown. To which he added, that, in all his proceedings again&s;t tho&s;e Per&s;ons, he had never the lea&s;t intention of violating the lea&s;t Priviledge of Parliament; and in ca&s;e any doubt of breach of Privi|ledge <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> remain'd, he would be willing to a&s;&s;ert it by any rea&s;onable way his Parliament &s;hould advi&s;e him to; and therefore he de&s;ired them forthwith to lay by all jealou&s;ies, and apply them&s;elves to the publick and pre&s;&s;ing A&s;&s;airs, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of <HI>Ireland,</HI> wherein the good of the Kingdom, and the true Religion, which &s;hould ever be his fir&s;t care, were &s;o highly and &s;o nearly concern'd. And he de&s;ired them, that his care of Their Priviledges might increa&s;e their care of His Lawful Prerogative, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the mutual defence of each other, and both would be the foundation of a perpetual and perfect intelligence between his Maje&s;ty and Parliaments, and of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of his People.</Q></P>
<P>BUT this Me&s;&s;age was not &s;uch as they looked for; there &s;eem'd &s;till to be left a time for pro&s;ecution, and tho the errour in Form &s;eem'd to be con&s;ented to, yet the Sub&s;tance and Matter of the accu&s;ation might be &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on. And therefore they took no notice of it, but pro|ceeded in inflaming all men with the &s;en&s;e of the breach of Priviledge; and finding the general mettal &s;omewhat to abate, that they might keep up the apprehen&s;ion ofdanger, and the e&s;teem of their Darling the City, they con&s;ult about Adjourning both Hou&s;es into <HI>London;</HI> but finding &s;ome danger of infringing the Act of Parliament, from whence &s;ome <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> advantage might be taken to their prejudice, till that power might be cleared by a Law, they were contented to Adjourn their Hou&s;es as they had done for &s;ome days, and to appoint Committees, qualified with more power than the Hou&s;es had, to meet in <HI>London;</HI> which for the conve|nience of the Common Council, who took up the <HI>Guild&punc;Hall,</HI> cho&s;e to &s;it in <HI>Grocers-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>IT was wonder'd, that having All places &s;o much at their devotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;es appoint Com|mittees to &s;it in <HI>Grocers-Hall.</HI></NOTE> they would remove from their more convenient &s;eats at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> where they might tran&s;act what&s;oever they de&s;ired without interruption, and where they were only di&s;turbed by their own direction. But the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> advantage they reaped by it was extraordinary; for, be&s;ides the fears they di&s;per&s;ed abroad, and the confidence they gave their own Friends of the City by being with them, they were &s;ure, for the mo&s;t part, to have a Committee to their own hearts de&s;ire; &s;ince, be&s;ides many out

<P>THE minds of men throughout the Kingdom being now prepared to receive all their Dictates with reverence, and to obey all their Orders, and to believe that all their &s;afety con&s;i&s;ted in, and depended upon their Authority, and there being few within the Hou&s;e, who had courage to oppo&s;e and contradict them, they &s;ent to the Lords to quicken them in the Bill, they had formerly &s;ent to them concerning removing the Bi&s;hops out of their Hou&s;e; which now, when there were &s;o many of them Pri&s;oners in the Tower, they pre&s;umed would not meet with &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">The C$mmons go upon S$ <HI>John&punc;$</HI> Bill of the $word$ $word$.</NOTE> great an oppo&s;ition. In the Hou&s;e of Commons they called to have the Bill read, which had layn &s;o long there, the &s;ame that had been brought <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in by S^$ <HI>Johns</HI> for the &s;etling the Militia of the Kingdom; to which they Now added <Q>&startq;&endq;the putting all the Forts, Ca&s;tles, and Garri&s;ons into the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons as they could <HI>Confide</HI> in;</Q> which was the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion they u&s;ed, when they had a mind to remove any man from a place, of which he was ju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they could not <HI>Confide</HI> in him,</Q> which they thought to be rea&s;on enough to di&s;place any man. When this Bill had been with much ado accepted, and fir&s;t read, there were few men, who imagined it would ever receive further counte|nance: but now there were few, who did not believe it to be a very nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom. So <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> great an impre&s;&s;ion had the late proceedings made upon them; &s;o that with little oppo&s;ition it pa&s;&s;ed the Commons, and was &s;ent up to the Lords.</P>
<P>UPON the disbanding the late Army in the North, all the Artillery, Arms, and Ammunition, that was provided for that &s;ervice, had been by the King's command &s;ent to <HI>Hull,</HI> where it &s;till remained; and his Maje&s;ty intended it &s;hould be kept there, for a Magazine upon all oc|ca&s;ions. And he had a little before the&s;e late pa&s;&s;ages &s;ent the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> thither, with a private Commi&s;&s;ion to be Governour thereof, a&s;&s;oon as it &s;hould be fit to publi&s;h &s;uch a Command; and in the mean <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> time by his own Intere&s;t to draw in &s;uch of the Country, as were nece&s;|&s;ary to Guard the Magazine. But nothing the King did in the mo&s;t private manner, but was quickly known to tho&s;e, from whom it &s;hould mo&s;t have been concealed. And &s;o the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> was no &s;ooner gone, but notice was taken of it; and he had not been three days in <HI>Hull,</HI> before the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;ent for him, to attend the Service of that Hou&s;e, which he had rarely u&s;ed to do, being for the mo&s;t part at <HI>Richmond</HI> attending upon the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who&s;e Governour he was. He made no ha&s;t to return upon the Summons of the Hou&s;e, but &s;ent to the King to know His plea&s;ure; who not thinking mat$ers yet <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> ripe enough to make any Such declaration, appointed him to come away; upon which he appeared in the Hou&s;e, without being asked where he had been.</P>

And this was the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay they made of their So|vereign power over the Militia and the Forts, whil&s;t their Bill was yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> depending, and was a &s;ufficient manife&s;tation what they intended to do, when it &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed; towards which they made all the ha&s;t they could, exerci&s;ing the King's patience every day with &s;ome di&s;agreeable Me&s;&s;age to him, upon their Priviledges, and requiring <Q>&endq;&startq;vindication, and reparation, and di&s;covery of the per&s;ons who had promoted that Pro&s;ecution.</Q> And tho' the Council once a week attended upon his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> he could not freely con&s;ult with them upon what mo&s;t concerned him.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ad condition was the King at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> fallen in ten days from a Height and Greatne&s;s that his Enemys feared, to &s;uch a Lowne&s;s, that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> his own Servants dur&s;t hardly avow the waiting on him. For tho', `tis true, the acts of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Tumults, were as great affronts to Maje&s;ty, before this la&s;t Act upon the Members, as any that could be imagined po&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed, yet the Hou&s;e of Peers was Then well di&s;po&s;ed, and might have been managed with a little patience, to have bla&s;ted all the extravagances of the Commons. And the truth is, the greate&s;t extravagances appeared to the &s;tanders by to be but the at|tempts of per&s;ons in De&s;pair, and the &s;truglings of men at the la&s;t Ga&s;p. And, without doubt, if the King could have had the patience to have &s;ate <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;till a Spectator of the Di&s;&s;entions between the two Hou&s;es, and in|couraging the Lords, who were firm to him, and putting tho&s;e matters in i&s;&s;ue, wherein the Commons had invaded both His and the Lords Priviledges; if he had commanded his Council at Law and the Judges, to have proceeded by the &s;trict rules of the Law again&s;t Seditious per|&s;ons at large, for Preaching and Printing again&s;t the peace of the King|dom, and put the Commons Hou&s;e either to have been quiet, whil&s;t their Champions were exemplary puni&s;hed (which would have put a &s;peedy end to their Licence) or to have appeared the Champions for an Infamous Act again&s;t the Law and the Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom, their Juri&s;diction would probably in a &s;hort time have been brought within <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the Due limits, and the &s;toute&s;t Factor for the violent Party been glad to have compounded for an Act of Oblivion.</P>
<P>AND I have heard from Credible per&s;ons, that the Chief of that Faction afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, that if that extraordinary Accident had
<PB N="306" REF="3260">
not happened to give them New credit and reputation, they were &s;ink|ing under the weight of the Expectation of tho&s;e, whom they had de|luded, and the Envy of tho&s;e, whom they had oppre&s;&s;ed. I am &s;ure, they who out of Con&s;cience, and Loyalty to their King and Country, di|ligently attended the publick Service, were &s;trangely &s;urprized at the matter and manner of that accu&s;ation; and fore&s;aw, from the minute, the infinite di&s;advantage it would bring to the King's affairs. Not that they thought the Gentlemen accu&s;ed, le&s;s Guilty; for their extream di&s;hone&s;t acts in the Hou&s;e were &s;o vi&s;ible, that nothing could have been laid to their charge incredible: but the going through with it was a mat|ter <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of &s;o great difficulty and concernment, that every Circum&s;tance ought to have been fully deliberated, and the &s;everal parts di&s;tributed into Such hands, as would not have Shaken in the execution. And the &s;aying, that the King had not competent per&s;ons enough, whom he might tru&s;t in &s;o important a Secret (which I believe was true) is rather an Argument, that the thing was not to be attempted at all, than that it was to be attempted in That manner; for whoever would have betray|ed the tru&s;t, would be &s;ure to find fault with it, when it was endeavoured without him, e&s;pecially if it mi&s;carried. The truth is, there was lit|tle rea&s;on to believe, that the Hou&s;e of Peers would commit the Lord <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> <HI>Kimbolton</HI> upon the Accu&s;ation of M^r Atturney in that conjuncture of time; and le&s;s that the Hou&s;e of Commons would deliver up their Mem|bers to the Serjeant at Arms, when they &s;hould be demanded; which was an Irregular thing, and implied unrea&s;onably, that They had &s;ome Power to Keep them, Who were De&s;ired to deliver them Yet if the choice had been better made, and the &s;everal per&s;ons fir&s;t Apprehended, and put into di&s;tinct clo&s;e Cu&s;todies, that neither any body el&s;e &s;hould have heard from them, nor they one from another, all which had not been very difficult, the high Spirit of both Hou&s;es might po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;o dejected, that they might have been Treated withall.

But <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> there can be no Priviledge, of which the Law doth not take notice, and which is not pleadable by, and at Law.</P>
<P>THE truth and clearne&s;s of this will be&s;t appear by In&s;tance&punc; If I am Arre&s;ted by Proce&s;s out of any Court, I am to plead in the Court, that I am a Member of Parliament, and that, by the Priviledge of Parlia|ment, my Per&s;on ought to be free from Arre&s;ts. Upon this Plea the Judge is bound to di&s;charge me; and if he does not, he is a Criminal, as for any other tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t the Law: but the puni&s;hing the Per&s;on, who hath made this infringement, is not within His power, but proper to that Juri&s;diction, again&s;t which the contempt is; therefore that Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of which I am a Member, upon complaint made of &s;uch an Arre&s;t, u&s;ually &s;ends for the per&s;ons culpable, the party at who&s;e Suit the Arre&s;t is made, and the Officers which executed it, and commits them to Pri&s;on, till they make acknowledgement of their Offence. But that Hou&s;e ne|ver &s;ends, at lea&s;t never did till this Parliament, any Order to the Court out of which the Proce&s;s i&s;&s;ued, to &s;tay the proceedings at Law, becau&s;e the Priviledge ought to be legally pleaded. So, after the Di&s;&s;olution of Parliament, if I am Arre&s;ted within the days of Priviledge, upon any plea of Priviledge the Court di&s;charges me; but then the Party that Ar|re&s;ts me, e&s;capes puni&s;hment till the next Parliament, the Judge having <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> no more power to commit the man that &s;ued or arre&s;ted me, than he hath to impri&s;on a man for bringing an Action at Law, when he hath no good title; neither is He Judge of the contempt.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if a man brings an Information, or an Action of the Ca&s;e, for words &s;poken by me, and I plead that the words were &s;poken by me in Parliament, when I was a Member there, and that it is again&s;t the Priviledge of Parliament, that I &s;hould be impleaded in any other place, for the words I &s;poke There; I ought to be di&s;charged from this Action or Information, becau&s;e this Priviledge is known, and pleadable at Law; but That Judge can neither puni&s;h, nor examine the breach <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of Priviledge, nor Cen&s;ure the contempt. And this is the true and pro|per meaning of the old received Axiom, that they are Judges Only of their own Priviledges.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the not putting the Forts into &s;uch hands, in whom the Par|liament might Confide, the not &s;etling the Kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence, the not removing the pre&s;ent Lieutenant of the Tower, and putting &s;uch a per&s;on into that place, as might be well approved by the Parliament, could not but overthrow Trading more and more, and make moneys yet more &s;carce in the City and Kingdom. That the mi&s;under&s;tanding between the King and Parliament, the not vindi|cating the Priviledges thereof, the charging &s;ome Members of Trea&s;on to the deterring of others from di&s;charging their Duties, and to the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> de&s;troying the very Being of Parliaments, did exceedingly fill the minds of men well affected to the publick, with many fears and di&s;courage|ments; and &s;o di&s;able them from yielding that chearful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they would be glad to afford. That, by this means, there was &s;uch a decay of Trading, and &s;uch &s;carcity of money, neither of which could be cured, till the former evils were removed, as it was like, in very &s;hort time, to ca&s;t innumerable multitudes of poor Artificers into &s;uch a depth of poverty and extremity, as might enforce them upon &s;ome dangerous and de&s;perate attempts, not fit to be Expre&s;&s;ed, much le&s;s to be Ju&s;tified; which they left to the Hou&s;e &s;peedily to con&s;ider, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> prevent.

And therefore they de&s;ired them, for the better removing of all the cau&s;es and &s;prings of their Fears and troubles, that the evil Coun&s;ellors, and others hinder|ing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the Publick Good, might be taken from his Maje&s;ty, and the voting of the Bi&s;hops, and Popi&s;h Lords, to be removed out of that Honoura|ble Hou&s;e: And that the Petitioners, who would be ever ready to hazard their Lives and E&s;tates for the defence of the King and Parlia|ment, the Priviledges of the &s;ame, and in &s;pecial tho&s;e noble Lords and Gentlemen in both Hou&s;es, who&s;e endeavours were for the Publick Good, might have liberty to Prote&s;t again&s;t all tho&s;e, as Enemys to the Kingdom, who refu&s;ed to joyn with tho&s;e Honourable Lords and the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the putting the Kingdom into a way of Safety, under the Command of &s;uch per&s;ons, as the Parliament &s;hould <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> appoint.</Q> But neither this, nor any of the other Proceedings were re|&s;ented by the Hou&s;e of Peers, tho' their Priviledges were not only in|vaded, but the very Freedom and liberty of Parliament ab&s;olutely taken away and de&s;troyed thereby.</P>
<P>WHEN the Hou&s;e of Commons found that none of the&s;e extraordi|nary ways would throughly Subdue the Hou&s;e of Lords, but that, tho' they had very &s;turdy Champions there, the Major part, albeit the Bi&s;hops, and all the Recu&s;ant Lords were driven from thence, &s;till oppo&s;ed them, whereby neither the Bill for the taking away the Bi&s;hops Votes, nor about Pre&s;&s;ing, could pa&s;s, and that they peremptorily &s;till refu&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> joyn in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia; they &s;ound a New way, as Un|practiced and as unnatural as any of the former, whereby they would be &s;ure to have an influence upon the Hou&s;e of Peers. It is an old Cu&s;tom, and Priviledge of that Hou&s;e, that upon any &s;olemn debate, who&s;oever is not &s;atisfied with the conclu&s;ion and judgment of the Hou&s;e, may demand leave to enter his Prote&s;tation, which mu&s;t be granted. The Original of this was in Jealous times, when men de&s;ired, for avoiding the ill con&s;equence of any Act there, that their Di&s;&s;ents might appear; and was very &s;eldom practiced, but when they conceived Religion, or the Crown, trenched upon; in&s;omuch as you &s;hall not find, in the Jour|nals <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of many Parliaments, one Prote&s;tation enter'd; and when there was any, there was no more in the Records, than, after the Re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e is enter'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that &s;uch a Lord de&s;ired that his Prote&s;tation or di&s;&s;ent might be enter'd,</Q> and oftentimes when &s;everal have di&s;&s;ented from the general opinion, not above one or two have enter'd their Pro|te&s;tation. But &s;ince this Parliament, as they alter'd this Cu&s;tom from ca&s;es of high Concernment to the mo&s;t trivial Debates, the Minor part ordinarily entering their Prote&s;tation, to the end that their opinions might be taken notice of, and who were oppo&s;ite to them, whereby the Good and Bad Lords were known and publi&s;hed; &s;o they altered the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> form, and in&s;tead of &s;hort general entries, cau&s;ed the matter of Debate to be &s;ummed up, and thereupon their Prote&s;tation, <Q>&startq;&endq;that They were not to be an&s;werable for any inconveniences or Mi&s;chiefs, that &s;hould
<PB N="319" REF="3390">
befall the Common-wealth by rea&s;on of this or that Re&s;olution.</Q> So that from an Act for the particular Indemnity of the per&s;on, that made it, it grew &s;ometimes to be a reproaching and arraigning the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e by any Factious number that di&s;agreed. Then becau&s;e the Hou&s;e of Peers is a Court of Record, they concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;that any man upon any occa&s;ion might peru&s;e the Journals;</Q> and &s;o every night the Hou&s;e of Commons could &s;ee how the Debates had been managed and carried all the day, and take publick notice, and make u&s;e of it accordingly, which they could not do of tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es they received from their Confidents; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> for &s;upplying whereof this Unju&s;tifiable method was found out. For tho' it is a Court of Record, the highe&s;t Court, and the Acts and judg|ments of Parliament are Records, to which the Subject may upon all occa&s;ions re&s;ort, yet they ought not to make u&s;e of that Liberty in or|der to que&s;tion any words &s;poken, or Acts done, and remember'd There; of which if the Lords are not the only Judges, their Priviledges are much le&s;s than the Commons intruth have, and may Ju&s;tly claim.</P>
<P>IT happened, about this time, that upon &s;ome Overture in the Lords Hou&s;e, which plea&s;ed them not, the Violent Party there, in a di&s;orderly manner, cried out, <HI>Adjourn, Adjourn,</HI> being not willing the matter <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;hould Then come into debate; others were not willing that the Hou&s;e &s;hould Adjourn. The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> troubled at that Tumultuary and indirect proceeding, &s;aid, without directing him&s;elf to the Speaker, "if they would Adjourn, he wi&s;hed it might be for &s;ix Months, or words to that effect; upon which &s;ome of the other party immediately Moved, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Hou&s;e might Not ri&s;e, and that the Duke would explain him|&s;elf, and an&s;wer the making &s;uch a Motion, as, being granted, would be de&s;tructive to the Common wealth. The Duke &s;aid, "he made no Motion, but u&s;ed that Expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;hew his di&s;like of the other Motion to Adjourn at that time, when there was bu&s;ine&s;s in agitation <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of great Concernment; and that, when he &s;poke, all men being upon their feet,</Q> and out of their places, he conceived the Hou&s;e had been Up. Upon this he was required to withdraw; and then they, who had long looked upon him with great envy and animo&s;ity, as the only great per|&s;on, and Officer at Court, who had di&s;countenanced their power, and their &s;tratagems, and had with notable courage allways oppo&s;ed their extravagances, and Servile complying with the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;ubmitting to the Tumults, and had with &s;ingular Con&s;tancy pre|&s;erved his duty and fidelity to his Maje&s;ty unviolated, inveighed again&s;t that Motion, <Q>&startq;&endq;as of too Serious a nature to be made a Je&s;t of, and fit <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to be cen&s;ured as mo&s;t pernicious to This Kingdom, and de&s;tructive to <HI>Ireland:</HI> the War whereof could not proceed, if the Parliament &s;hould have been Adjourned for &s;ix Months, as his Lord&s;hip had pro|po&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, it was alledged, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Motion had never been made to the Hou&s;e; and therefore they ought no more to que&s;tion, or take notice of it, than of every light or frolick di&s;cour&s;e or Expre&s;&s;ion, that negligently, or Ca&s;ually fell from any man; which would take away all liberty of Conver&s;ation. However, that if it had been Se|riou&s;ly, and formally made, it could be no Crime, it being the ne|ce&s;&s;ary <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> liberty and Priviledge of every Member, to make any Motion he thought in His judgment fit, which the Hou&s;e would approve, or reject, as it found rea&s;onable. And that, &s;ince it was as much in the Hou&s;es power to Adjourn for &s;ix Months, as for &s;ix Days, it was as
<PB N="320" REF="3400">
lawful to move the one, as the other; of which there could not be the lea&s;t inconvenience, becau&s;e the Hou&s;e would be &s;ure to reject it, if it were not found proper.</Q> After a very fierce, and eager debate, in which much bitterne&s;s and Virulency was expre&s;&s;ed, it was Re&s;olved by the Major part, "that the Duke had committed no Offence; and &s;o he was as regularly ab&s;olved as was po&s;&s;ible. Hereupon the Earls of <HI>Northumberland, Pembroke, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who thought the Dukes affection and duty to his Ma&s;ter a Repoach, and his intere&s;t pre|judicial to Them, with the re&s;t of that Party enter'd their Prote&s;tation; <Q>&startq;&endq;that whereas &s;uch a Motion had been made by the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and upon being que&s;tioned for the &s;ame, he had been acquitted by the Major part, They were free from the mi&s;chiefs or inconveniences, which might attend the not puni&s;hing of an Offence tending &s;o much to the prejudice of King or Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Prote&s;tation, by the advice of that Nights meeting, was, the next day, taken notice of in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the matter it &s;elf of the Motion inlarged upon, by all po&s;&s;ible and Rhetorical aggra|vations, concerning the Per&s;on, and his Intere&s;ts, according to the li|cence of that Hou&s;e, and that People. It was &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;here was an evil Coun&s;ellor, that had di&s;covered him&s;elf, and no doubt had been the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Author of many of tho&s;e evil Coun&s;els, which had brought that trou|ble upon us; that he had received his education in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had been made a Grandee of that Kingdom, and had been ever &s;ince noto|riou&s;ly of that Faction; that his Si&s;ters were Papi&s;ts, and therefore his affection was to be que&s;tioned in Religion; that, from the beginning of this Parliament, he had been oppo&s;ite to all their proceedings, and was an enemy to Reformation; that he had vehemently oppo&s;ed the Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> was a friend to Bi&s;hops; and now, to prevent any po&s;&s;ibility of Reformation, which could not be effected without the Concurrence of the two Hou&s;es, had de&s;perately Moved <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> in the Hou&s;e of Peers, where he had a great Faction, that it would Adjourn for &s;ix Months; in which time the Malignant Party, of which he might well be thought the Head, and had the greate&s;t influence upon the King's affections, would prevail &s;o far, that all future hopes would be render'd de&s;perate, and the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> be utterly lo&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts: that they were therefore to take this op|portunity, which God had given them, to remove &s;o Malignant and dangerous a per&s;on from the King, and one &s;o &s;u&s;pected, from &s;o im|portant a Charge as the Cinque Ports, of which the Duke was Lord Warden, and to &s;end to the Lords to joyn with them in a de&s;ire to the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> King to that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, it was objected, that <Q>&startq;&endq;whil&s;t they were &s;o Solli|citous for their own Priviledges, and &s;en&s;ible of the breach and viola|tion of them, they could not more Ju&s;tify tho&s;e, who had been the Advi&s;ers of &s;uch breaches, than by offering the like tre&s;pa&s;s to the Priviledges of the Peers: that the life of that Council depended on the liberty of Speech, and where there were &s;o different minds, there mu&s;t be different expre&s;&s;ions, and if one Hou&s;e might take notice what the other Hou&s;e &s;aid, or did, within Tho&s;e walls, the Lords would as well que&s;tion Their Members, as they did now one of the Lords; which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> would take away all freedom of debate: that they could not examine the Circum&s;tances, which attended that Motion, if any &s;uch was made; and therefore could not &s;o much as, in their private under&s;tandings,
<PB N="321" REF="3410">
make a rea&s;onable judgment of it, but that they were naturally to pre|&s;ume the circum&s;tances were &s;uch, as took away the Offence of the Motion; for that the Major part of that Hou&s;e, where the words were &s;poken, and at the time when they were &s;poken, had, upon Solemn debate, concluded, that there was no Crime in them; and that they were not only the Proper, but the Only Judges in that ca&s;e: and if the Commons &s;hould intermeddle therewith, it was no otherwi&s;e, than, by the &s;trength of the Major part of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to make the Minor part of Lords Superior to the Major part of that Hou&s;e; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> which they would not &s;uffer to be offered to Them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>IT was alledged, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Duke was a per&s;on of great Honour and integrity, and of &s;o unblemi&s;hed a fame, that in all the di&s;covery of the Court offences, there was not any reflection upon Him. That his education had been, according to the be&s;t rules of the Greate&s;t per|&s;ons, for &s;ome years beyond the Seas; and that, having &s;pent more time in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he vi&s;ited <HI>Spain;</HI> where his great Quality being known, and no que&s;tion as a Compliment to this Kingdom, with which it was then in &s;treight Alliance and Confederacy, that King had con|ferred the honour of Grandee upon him; which was of no other ad|vantage <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> or &s;ignification to him, than to be Covered in the pre&s;ence of that King, as the principal Subjects there are. That his affection to the Prote&s;tant Religion was unque&s;tionable and very Eminent; and tho' his Si&s;ters, who had been bred under their Mother, were Roman Catholicks, yet his Brothers, of who&s;e education He had taken the &s;ole care, were very good Prote&s;tants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT his opinions in Parliament had been very Avowed, and were to be pre&s;umed to be according to his Con&s;cience, in the profe&s;&s;ion of which he was &s;o publick, that there was rea&s;on to believe he u&s;ed no Ill arts in private; &s;ince he had the courage to do that Aloud, which <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> he had rea&s;on to believe would di&s;plea&s;e many. That it would be a great prejudice, and blemi&s;h to their Councils and Di&s;coveries, if after &s;o long di&s;cour&s;e of a Malignant Party, and evil Coun&s;ellors, of which they had never yet named any, they &s;hould fir&s;t brand This Lord with that imputation upon &s;uch a ground and occa&s;ion, as mu&s;t include all tho&s;e Lords who had ab&s;olved him, which was the Major part of the Lords. In a word, that it would look as if they had devi&s;ed tho&s;e New words to make men afraid, and keep them in re&s;erve to apply to all tho&s;e with whom they were Angry.</Q></P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all this, and all the rea&s;on that could be &s;poken <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> on that part, and that there could be none on the other, after a debate of very many hours, till after nine of the Clock at Night (the late&s;t that ever was in the Parliament, but that of the Remon&s;trance) in which it was evident, that they meant as far as in them lay, to Confound all tho&s;e, whom they could not Convert; it was Re&s;olved by the Majority of Voices, not Half of the Hou&s;e being pre&s;ent at that un&s;ea&s;onable time of the debate, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they &s;hould accu&s;e the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> to the Lords to be one of the Malignant Party, and an evil Coun&s;ellor to his Maje&s;ty; and to de&s;ire them to joyn in a reque&s;t to the King, that he might be re|moved from any Office or imployment about his per&s;on;</Q> which was &s;o|lemnly <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> recommended to the Lords accordingly, and by them &s;o far re|ceived, that tho' the de&s;ire was rejected, no di&s;like or di&s;approbation of the Matter or the Manner was in the lea&s;t di&s;covered, or in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>ALL things thus prepared, and &s;o many Lords driven and kept from
<PB N="322" REF="3420">
the Hou&s;e, be&s;ides the Bi&s;hops, and they that &s;tayed there, by this la&s;t in|&s;tance, in&s;tructed how to carry them&s;elves, at lea&s;t how they provoked the Good Lords to Prote&s;t, they re&s;olved once more to try whether the Hou&s;e of Peers would be induced to joyn in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia, which they had twice refu&s;ed; and to that purpo&s;e, their old Friends of the City in the &s;ame numbers flocked to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but under the New, received, and allowed &s;tyle of Petitioners; but as unlike Petitioners to any of tho&s;e Lords or Commons, whom they under&s;tood to be Malignant, as the other Tumults had been. From the&s;e herds there were two notable Petitions delivered to the Hou&s;e of Commons, the one from the Porters, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> their number, as they &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen thou&s;and; the other under the title of many thou&s;ands of poor people in, and about the City of <HI>London</HI> The Porters, with great Eloquence, confe&s;&s;ed <Q>the unexpre&s;&s;ible &startq;&endq;pains, that Honourable Hou&s;e had taken for the Good of Church and State; which de&s;erved to be recorded to their eternal fame, tho' the Effects of tho&s;e unwearied endeavours were not produced, by rea&s;on of the prevalence of that adver&s;e, malignant, blood-&s;ucking, Rebellious party, by the power of which the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Li|berty of the Subject was trampled upon, the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> in|crea&s;ed, and all &s;uccours and relief for that Kingdom ob&s;tructed. They <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;aid, "that Trade had been long langui&s;hing, but was Now dead by the fears, jealou&s;ies, and di&s;tractions they lay under, for want of fortification of the C$nque Ports, which was a great incouragement to the Papi&s;ts to make In&s;urrections, and did much animate a Forreign power to Invade us: that by the deadne&s;s of Trade they did want imployment in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, as did make their lives very uncomfortable; therefore their Reque&s;t was, that that extream nece&s;&s;ity of theirs might be taken into &s;erious con&s;ideration, and that the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons would fall upon the &s;peedie&s;t cour&s;e for abating and quelling the pride, outrage, and in&s;olency, of the adver&s;e Party at home; that the land <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> might be &s;ecured by fortifying the Cinque Ports, and putting the peo|ple into a po&s;ture of defence, that all their fears, or as many as could, might be removed, and that Trade might be again &s;et up and opened, that their wants might be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplied. They further de|&s;ired that Ju&s;tice might be done upon Offenders, according as the Atro|city of their crimes had de&s;erved; for if tho&s;e things were any longer &s;u&s;pended, they &s;hould be forced to extremities not fit to be named, and to make good that &s;aying, that Nece&s;&s;ity hath no Law. They &s;aid, they had nothing to lo&s;e but their lives, and tho&s;e they would willingly ex|po&s;e to the utmo&s;t peril, in defence of the Hou&s;e of Commons, accord|ing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to their Prote&s;tation, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE other was a Petition in the names of many thou&s;ands of poor peo|ple, and brought by a multitude of &s;uch, who &s;eemed prepared for any exploit.

<P>AFTER this &s;candalous, and extravagant Petition delivered, the Hou&s;e, according to its gracious cu&s;tom, ordered thanks to be given for their great kindne&s;s. To the Which when it was delivered by the Speaker, who told them that the Hou&s;e was in con&s;ideration of tho&s;e things,

to the Lords took notice <Q>&startq;&endq;of their happy concurrence with the Hou&s;e of Commons in &s;elting the Militia, and Forts, in &s;uch hands as the Common-wealth might Confide in, and the Kingdom in &s;uch a po&s;ture as might be for its defence, and &s;afeguard: yet they complained of the mi&s;erable condition of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which, they &s;aid, by the delay it had found among&s;t their Lord&s;hips, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ing endea|vours of the Hou&s;e of Commons, together with many of their Lord|&s;hips, had been expo&s;ed to the inhuman cruelties of their mercyle&s;s Enemys.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WHEREFORE they did humbly pray, and be&s;eech their Lord&s;hips, that they would go on in a con&s;tant Union with the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, in providing for the Kingdoms &s;afety; that all evil Coun&s;ellors might be found out, <HI>Ireland</HI> relieved; that the Votes of the Popi&s;h Lords, and Bi&s;hops, might be &s;peedily removed; that &s;o the Peace of the Kingdom might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Priviledges of Parliament vin|dicated, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and the purity of Religion &s;etled, and pre&s;erved.

<P>WHICH Petition was read in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and approved, and the Petitioners thanked for their kind expre&s;&s;ions therein; and then it was delivered by them at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Peers&punc; who, within a day or two, pa&s;&s;ed both the Bill for taking away the Bi&s;hops Votes, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">and the Bills touching the Bi&s;hops Votes, and Pre&s;&s;ing.</NOTE> that concerning Pre&s;&s;ing, which had lain &s;o long de&s;perate, whil&s;t the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Lords came&punc; and &s;ate with freedom in the Hou&s;e.

<P>UPON the &s;econd day of <HI>February,</HI> &s;ome Members, appointed by both Hou&s;es, attended his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> with their Petition, <Q>&startq;&endq;that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Hou&s;es Petition the King touching the Tower, F rts, and Militia, &amp;c. <HI>Feb 2.</HI></NOTE> he would forthwith put the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and all other Forts, and the whole Militia of the Kingdom into the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons, as &s;hould be recommended unto his Maje&s;ty by both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment; which, they a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves, would be a hopeful entrance into tho&s;e cour&s;es, which, through God's ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hould be effectual <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> for the removing all diffidence, and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion between his Ma|je&s;ty and his People; and for e&s;tabli&s;hing and enlarging the honour, greatne&s;s, and power of his Maje&s;ty, and Royal po&s;terity; and for the re&s;toring and confirming the Peace, and happine&s;s, of his loyal Sub|jects in all his Dominions. And to that their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Petition, they &s;aid, they did, in all humility, expect his &s;peedy and gracious An|&s;wer, the great Di&s;tractions, and Di&s;tempers of the Kingdom, not ad|mitting any delay.</Q></P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time they likewi&s;e pre&s;ented another Petition to him, concerning the accu&s;ed Members; in which they be&s;ought him <Q>&startq;&endq;to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> give directions, that the Parliament might be informed before <HI>Friday</HI> next (which was within two days) what proof there was again&s;t them, that accordingly they might be called to a legal Trial; it being the undoubted right, and Priviledge of Parliament, that no Member of
<PB N="326" REF="3460">
Parliament could be proceeded again&s;t, without the con&s;ent of Par|liament.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty now found that the&s;e per&s;ons could not be compounded with, and that their purpo&s;e was, by degrees, to get &s;o much Power into Their hands, that they need not care for what was left in His; and that the Lords were in no degree to be relied upon to maintain their Own Priviledges&punc; much le&s;s to defend His Rites; and that they had the power generally to impo&s;e upon the Peoples Under&s;tanding contrary to their own Sen&s;es, and to per&s;wade them, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they were in danger to be invaded by forreign Enemys,</Q> when the King was not only in peace <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> with all Chri&s;tian Princes, but allmo&s;t all other Nations &s;o imbroyled in War, that they all de&s;ired the Friend&s;h p and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England;</HI> none was in ca&s;e or condition to di&s;turb it: <Q>&startq;&endq;and that there was a decay and deadne&s;s of Trade, and Want and Poverty growing upon the whole Kingdom,</Q> when no man living had ever remember'd the like Plenty over the whole Land, and Trade was at that heigth, that the like had never been known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|&s;olves to $span$ from $word$</NOTE> HE re&s;olved therefore to remove him&s;elf to a greater di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> where the Fears and Jealou&s;ies grew; and con&s;tantly to deny to pa&s;s any Act, that &s;hould be recommended to him from the two <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;es, except what might concern <HI>Ireland,</HI> till he might have a full pro&s;pect of all they intended to demand, and an equal a&s;&s;urance how far they intended to gratify him for all his conde&s;cen&s;ions; which re&s;olution was very Parliamentary, it having been rarely known, till this pre&s;ent Parliament, that the King con&s;ented to any Acts, till the determination of the Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE truth is, when his Maje&s;ty found the extream ill &s;ucce&s;s of the accu&s;ation again&s;t the Members, and that the Tumults, and the Peti|tioners, were no other than an Army at the di&s;po&s;al of tho&s;e, in whom he had no rea&s;on to put his confidence, and that all &s;uch, who expre&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> any eminent zeal to his Service, would be taken from him under the &s;tyle of Delinquents and Malignants, he re&s;olved that the Queen, who was very full of fears, &s;hould go to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> Colonel <HI>Goring,</HI> who was Governour thereof, having found means to make good impre&s;&s;ions again in their Maje&s;ties of his Fidelity; and that Him&s;elf would go to <HI>Hull,</HI> where his Magazine of Cannon, Arms, and Ammunition was; and that being &s;ecured in tho&s;e &s;trong places, whither they, who wi&s;hed him well, might re&s;ort, and be protected, he would &s;it &s;till, till they, who were over active, would come to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT this, tho' re&s;olved with &s;o much &s;ecre&s;y, that it was not com|municated <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to three per&s;ons (as I have been &s;ince a&s;&s;ured by tho&s;e who knew) whether by the Treachery of one of tho&s;e few, or by the Curio|&s;ity of others (which I rather believe) who found means to over-hear all private di&s;cour&s;es (as both Bed&punc;Chambers were inhabited, and every corner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by diligent&punc;Spies upon their Ma&s;ter, and Mi&s;tri&s;s) was imparted to tho&s;e, who procured tho&s;e Orders before mentioned for <HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> by rea&s;on whereof, and the advice, and promi&s;e of many Lords, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would firmly unite them&s;elves for the ju&s;t &s;upport of the Regal power,</Q> with the extream apprehen&s;ion the Queen had of danger, that Coun&s;el was laid a&s;ide. That, which wrought &s;o <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> much upon the Queens fears, be&s;ides the general ob&s;ervation how the King was betrayed, and how his Rights, and Power, were every day wre&s;ted from him, was an adverti&s;ement, that &s;he had received, of a
<PB N="327" REF="3470">
de&s;ign in the prevalent Party to have accu&s;ed her Maje&s;ty of High-Trea|&s;on; of which, without doubt, there had been &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e in their mo&s;t private Cabals, and, I am per&s;waded, was imparted to her upon de&s;ign, and by connivance (for there were &s;ome incorporated into that Faction, who exactly knew her nature, pa&s;&s;ions, and infirmities) that the di&s;dain of it might tran&s;port her to &s;omewhat which might give Them advantage. And &s;hortly after that di&s;covery to her Maje&s;ty, tho&s;e per&s;ons before mentioned were accu&s;ed of High-Trea&s;on; yet afterwards, when they had received the full fruites, they found means to complain, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <Q>&startq;&endq;as a great argument of the malignity of tho&s;e per&s;ons of nearne&s;s to both their Maje&s;ties, that an infu&s;ion had been made to the Queen, that there was a purpo&s;e of accu&s;ing her of High-Trea&s;on,</Q> and &s;olemn|ly by Me&s;&s;age <Q>&startq;&endq;be&s;ought her to di&s;cover, Who had done that malitious Office;</Q> when they very well knew Who it was, and for Who&s;e &s;ake the Queen was brought to return An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;&endq;that &s;he had heard &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, but took no notice of it,</Q> as never believing it; whereas if &s;he could have been compelled to have di&s;covered, how they knew that the Queen had been informed, all the &s;ecret would have appeared; the &s;ame per&s;on fir&s;t telling her what was in projection again&s;t her, and then re|turning <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Intelligence of any expre&s;&s;ions, and di&s;temper, he might ea&s;ily ob&s;erve upon the apprehen&s;ion which the other begot.</P>
<P>BUT both King and Queen were then upon that di&s;advantage, that all their words, and actions, which were the pure re&s;ults of their own rea&s;ons, and judgments upon what they &s;aw every day occurred, were called the effects of evil Coun&s;els, that &s;o they might take the liberty to reproach them with the more licence; whil&s;t what they received by the mo&s;t &s;ecret perjury of Bed&punc;Chamber Spies, or what they forged them&s;elves, was urged as the re&s;ult of common Fame, or the effects of their Fears and Jealou&s;ies, to the rancour of which the mo&s;t precious <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> balm of the Crown mu&s;t be applied. And therefore it was concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Queen &s;hould take the opportunity of her Daughter the Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Mary's</HI> Journey into <HI>Holland</HI> (who had been before married to the young Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI></Q> and was now &s;olemnly de&s;ired by the States Emba&s;&s;adours to come into that Country) <Q>&startq;&endq;to tran&s;port her &s;elf into <HI>Holland,</HI> patiently to expect an amendment of the affairs of <HI>England;</HI> and that the King &s;hould retire into the North, and re&s;ide at <HI>York,</HI> and deny all Particulars, till the Whole alteration &s;hould be framed.</Q> But the fir&s;t re&s;olution concerning the Queen was only publi&s;hed, the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> other, concerning the King, communicated to very few; both their Ma|je&s;ties being reduced to &s;o great wants, that the Queen was compelled to coyn, or &s;ell, her Chamber Plate for the &s;upply of her mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, there being no money in the Exchequer, or in the power of the Mini&s;ters of the Revenue; the Officers of the Cu&s;toms, out of which the allowance for the weekly &s;upport of their Maje&s;ties Hou&s;hold had been made, being injoined by the Hou&s;e of Commons, not to i&s;&s;ue out any money, without their particular con&s;ent, and approbation.</P>
<P>IT was evident now that the accu&s;ed Members were too mighty for the King or the Law, and that they would admit no other Judges of their guilt, than Them&s;elves, nor rules of proceeding than the Plurality <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of their Own voices: and therefore the King re&s;olved to give over any more thought of that bu&s;ine&s;s. And &s;o to that Petition he An&s;wered, <Q>&startq;&endq;that as he once conceived that he had ground enough to accu&s;e them, &s;o Now he found as good cau&s;e wholely to wave any pro&s;ecution of
<PB N="328" REF="3480">
them.</Q> The other Petition concerning the Militia gave him more trouble; for tho&punc; he was re&s;olved in no degree to con&s;ent to it, yet he was willing, till all things could be ready for the Queen's Journey, and &s;o for his own remove, father to Delay it, than Deny it; le&s;t the &s;ame Army of Petitioners might come to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to per&s;wade him, which had Converted, or prevailed over the Hou&s;e of Peers. And he was per|&s;waded by &s;ome, who thought they knew the temper of both Hou&s;es, that tho&punc; they were now united in the Matter, they might ea&s;ily be di|vided upon the Circum&s;tances: and that they would not be of one mind in the election of the Per&s;ons to be Confided in. So that to that Peti|tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> his Maje&s;ty returned this An&s;wer:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King s An&s;wer to the Petition con|cerning the Militia.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT he was willing to apply a remedy not only to their Dangers, but to their Doubts and Fears; and therefore that when he &s;hould know the extent of power, which was intended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom they de&s;ired to be Commanders of the Militia in the &s;everal Counties, and likewi&s;e to what time it &s;hould be limited, that no power &s;hould be executed by his Maje&s;ty alone without the advice of Parliament, Then he would declare that he would be content to put in all the Forts, and over the Militia, &s;uch per&s;ons as both Hou&s;es of Parliament &s;hould either approve, or recommend to him; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;o that they before declared the names of the per&s;ons, whom they would approve or recommend; and &s;o that no Per&s;ons &s;hould be named by them, again&s;t whom his Maje&s;ty &s;hould have ju&s;t, and Un|que&s;tionable exception.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH An&s;wer, tho' it was not a Con&s;ent, gave them notable incou|ragement, and exceedingly united the vulgar minds to them; who con|curred only with them, as they &s;aw them like to Prevail in what they went about. And there was no danger of any di&s;union in the Nomi|nation of Per&s;ons; becau&s;e, tho&punc; they &s;hould at fir&s;t admit &s;uch into the Number, whom they could not &s;ufficiently tru&s;t, nor plau&s;ibly except <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> again&s;t, yet when they were once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of Nomina|tion, they might ea&s;ily Weed out tho&s;e, which were not agreeable to the Soil they were planted in. However this would take up &s;ome time; and therefore to keep the King's inclination to gratify them (for &s;o they would under&s;tand it) warm, the &s;ame day they received this An&s;wer, they returned a Me&s;&s;age of thanks; and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;&endq;whil&s;t they were preparing all other particulars according to his com|mand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of Common re|turn the King $span$ and $span$ may be $ade $word$ of t$$ $word$.</NOTE> that he would confer the cu&s;tody of the Tower upon S^r <HI>John Coniers,</HI></Q> whom they had lately recommended to his Maje&s;ty as a per|&s;on of great merit. With which being &s;urprized, and de&s;ired likewi&s;e <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> by S^r <HI>John Byron</HI> to free him from the Agony and vexation of that place, which had expo&s;ed his per&s;on and reputation to the rage and fury of the People, and compelled him to &s;ubmit to &s;uch reproaches, as a generous Spirit could not brook without much regret; for he had upon frivolous &s;urmi&s;es been &s;ent for as a Delinquent, and been brought upon his knees<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $word$ to it</NOTE> at the Par of both Hou&s;es; his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented to that alteration, and made S^r <HI>John Coniers</HI> Lieutenant of the Tower. Which was &s;uch an in&s;tance of his yielding upon Importunity, that from That time they thought them&s;elves even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Militia of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHILST all diligence was u&s;ed in making preparation for the Queens <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Journey; to divert their Councils from other inqui&s;ition, the King (who had received &s;o many &s;harp expo&s;tulations for breach of Priviledges, and other attemps upon their reputations) re&s;olved upon the publication
<PB N="329" REF="3490">
of a bold &s;candal upon him&s;elf by one of their principal Members, to expo&s;tulate with them, and try what &s;atisfaction and reparation they were prepared to Give him, who exacted &s;o much From him. All op|portunities had been taken in Publick, and all licence given to Private and clande&s;tine forgeries to lay odious, or envious imputation on the King and Queen, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and to impute the pro|gre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of that Rebellion to a connivance, if not a counte|nance, from the Court: the not levying men, and &s;ending provi&s;ions, imputed to his Maje&s;ty; tho' he had, as is before ob&s;erved, offered to levy <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> ten thou&s;and Voluntiers for that Service, and had con&s;ented chearfully to every propo&s;ition, that had been made with the lea&s;t reference to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Kingdom. Indeed he was &s;o alarm'd with tho&s;e per|petual odious &s;ugge&s;tions, which he perceived wrought very pernicious effects in the minds of the People, that he was compelled to con&s;ent to many things contrary to his judgment, and Kingly policy, to prevent greater inconveniences by tho&s;e &s;candals, which he &s;aw were prepared for him. So when &s;everal Propo&s;itions were recommended to him by the two Hou&s;es concerning tho&s;e Supplies, which were to be &s;ent out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t, there was one, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Scots &s;hould <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> have the Command, and keeping of the Town, and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carrick|&s;ergus;</HI> and if any Regiments, or Troops, in that Province &s;hould joyn with them, that they &s;hould receive Orders from the Com|mander of the Scoti&s;h Forces.</Q> The King con&s;ented to all the re&s;t, tho' there were matters unrea&s;onable enough in favour of that Nation; but "That, he &s;aid, "he could not approve of; and wi&s;hed <Q>&startq;&endq;the Hou&s;es to take that Propo&s;ition again into con&s;ideration, as a bu&s;ine&s;s of very great importance, which he doubted might prove prejudicial to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the Service intended. And he &s;aid, if the Hou&s;es de&s;ired it, he would be willing to &s;peak with the Scoti&s;h Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to &s;ee what &s;atisfaction he could give them therein. This An&s;wer was no &s;ooner read, but both Hou&s;es Voted, <Q>&startq;&endq;that who&s;oever gave the King advice, or coun&s;el, to &s;end that An&s;wer, was an Enemy to the King, and Kingdom,</Q> and a Committee appointed to find out who tho&s;e evil Coun&s;ellors were. So that, the Scoti&s;h Commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;&s;ing him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that being their Native King&punc; he would not publi&s;h a le&s;s Tru&s;t and confidence in them, than their Neighbour Nation had done,</Q> his Maje&s;ty thought fit to con&s;ent to the whole, as the two Hou&s;es had advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>THEN, in the carrying on the War, they allowed his Maje&s;ty &s;o lit|tle <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> power, that when he recommended &s;ome Officers of prime qua|lity, reputation, and experience in the War, to the Lord Lieutenant to be imployed in that Service, the Hou&s;e of Commons by expre&s;s Or|der, and after they knew that his Maje&s;ty had recommended them, re|jected them, becau&s;e they were taken notice to have attended upon the King at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> as a Guard to his per&s;on. And after all this, they took all occa&s;ions to a&s;per&s;e him with any omi&s;&s;ions that were in that great work; as M^r <HI>Pym</HI> had more particularly done, in that Speech before taken notice of, at the Conference with the Lords, upon the delivery of tho&s;e Seditious Petitions; of which the King could not <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> take notice, le&s;t he &s;hould be again reproached with breach of Privi|ledge.</P>

He &s;aid, he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured that No per&s;on, who had command in the head of the Rebels, had pa&s;&s;ed by his War|rant, or Privity.

And therefore, he thought it very nece&s;&s;ary, and expected that they &s;hould Name tho&s;e per&s;ons, who had pa&s;&s;ed by his Licence, and were then in the head of the Rebels: or if, upon their reexamination, they did not find Particular evidence to prove that a&s;&s;ertion (as he was mo&s;t confident they never could) as that Affirmation, which reflected upon <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> his Maje&s;ty was very Publick, &s;o they would publi&s;h &s;uch a Declara|tion, whereby that mi&s;take might be di&s;covered; he being the more tender in that particular, which had reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and being mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he had been, and was, from his Soul, re&s;olved to di&s;charge his duty, for the relief of his poor Prote&s;tant Subjects, and the utter rooting out that Rebellion; &s;o that Service had not &s;uf|fer'd for the want of any thing propo&s;ed to him, and within His power to grant.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;in this matter he had diligently examined his own me|mory,</Q> and the notes of his Secretaries; and then named all the Iri&s;h <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> per&s;ons to whom he had given any Licences to go into that King|dom, &s;ince the beginning of that Rebellion; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;he was well a&s;&s;ured, none of Them were with the Rebels; and tho' &s;ome of them might be Papi&s;ts, yet he had no rea&s;on to have any &s;u&s;pition of them, in re&s;pect of their alliance with per&s;ons of great Honour and Power in that Kingdom, of who&s;e fidelity to him he had good a&s;&s;urance; and the Lords Ju&s;tices Them&s;elves having declared, that they were &s;o far from owning a jealou&s;y of All Papi&s;ts there, that they had put Arms into the Hands of divers Noblemen of that Religion, within the Pale, which the Parliament had well approved of. And therefore, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> unle&s;s the fir&s;t Affirmation of the Hou&s;e of Commons could be made good by &s;ome Particulars, he expected a vindication by &s;uch a De|claration as he had propo&s;ed; which, he &s;aid, was, in duty and Ju&s;tice, due to him.</Q></P>
<P>BUT this, and any thing el&s;e could be &s;aid, was &s;o far from pro|curing any Reparation, that when they perceived the King &s;till pre&s;&s;ed for that Ju&s;tice, and apprehended that many would believe it due to him, and that the prejudice they had rai&s;ed to him for <HI>Ireland</HI> would be removed thereby, they confidently publi&s;hed another Declaration of &s;everal per&s;ons Names, to whom they &s;aid the King had granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Pa&s;&s;es, and were then Commanders in the Rebels Army, of who&s;e Names his Maje&s;ty had never before heard, to whom no Pa&s;&s;es had been granted, neither did he believe that there were &s;uch men in Na|ture: and &s;o left the People to believe as they found them&s;elves in|clined upon the Kings denial, or Their &s;o Particular, and po&s;itive affir|mation.</P>
<P>THESE proceedings of the Parliament made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon all Noble and generous per&s;ons, who found that their Pride, and Am|bition was &s;o great, that they re&s;olved to remove all per&s;ons, who were like to &s;tand in their way by oppo&s;ing any thing they de&s;ired, or <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> by filling any place, or office, which they de&s;igned &s;hould be executed by &s;ome other per&s;on, in whom they could Confide. The Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> who was Governour to the Prince, knew very well in what prejudice he &s;tood with the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> (two very

He knew they liked not that he &s;hould have the Government of the Prince, as one, who would infu&s;e &s;uch principles into him, as would not be agreeable to their De&s;igns, and would di&s;po&s;e him to no kind|ne&s;s to their Per&s;ons, and that they would not re&s;t, till they &s;aw ano|ther man in that province; in order to which, they would pick all quar|rels <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> they could, and load him with all reproaches, which might bla&s;t him with the People, with whom he had a very good reputation. Upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> re&s;igns his place of Go|vernour to the Prince.</NOTE> tho&s;e con&s;iderations, and &s;ome other imaginations upon the pro&s;pect of Affairs, he very Wi&s;ely re&s;olved to retire from the Court, where he had expended much of his own Fortune, and only made him&s;elf obnoxious to the malice, and envy of other pretenders; and de&s;ired the King to approve of this his rea&s;onable inclination, and to put the Prince un|der the Tuition of &s;ome per&s;on of Honour of unque&s;tionable fidelity to him, and above the reach of Popular di&s;approbation; and, at the &s;ame time mentioned the Marque&s;s of <HI>Hartford,</HI> who was indeed Superiour <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to any Temptations.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marque&s;s of <HI>Hartford</HI> &s;ucceeds him.</NOTE> THE Marque&s;s of <HI>Hartford</HI> was a man of great Honour, Intere&s;t, and E&s;tate, and of an univer&s;al e&s;teem over the whole Kingdom; and tho' he had received many, and continued di&s;obligations, from the Court, from the time of this King's coming to the Crown, as well as during the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> in both which &s;ea&s;ons, more than ordinary care had been <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> taken to di&s;countenance and le&s;&s;en his Intere&s;t; yet he had carried him&s;elf with notable &s;teadine&s;s, from the beginning of the Parliament, in the &s;up|port and defence of the King's power and dignity, notwith&s;tanding all his Allies, and tho&s;e, with whom he had the greate&s;t familiarity and Friend&s;hip, were of the oppo&s;ite Party; and never concurred with them again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> whom he was known not to love, nor in any other extravagancy.</P>
<P>AND then, he was not to be &s;haken in his affection to the Govern|ment of the Church; tho' it was enough known that he was in no de|gree by a&s;&s;ed to any great inclination to the Per&s;on of any Church-man. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> And with all this, that Party carried them&s;elves towards him with pro|found re&s;pect, not pre&s;uming to venture their own credit in endeavour|ing to le&s;&s;en His.</P>
<P>IT is very true, he wanted &s;ome of tho&s;e qualities, which might have been wi&s;hed to be in a per&s;on to be tru&s;ted in the education of a great, and hopeful Prince, and in forming of his mind and manners in &s;o ten|der an age. He was of an age not fit for much activity and fatigue, and loved, and was even wedded &s;o much to his ea&s;e, that he loved his book above all exerci&s;es; and had even contracted &s;uch a lazine&s;s of mind, that he had no delight in an open and liberal Conver&s;ation; and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> cared not to di&s;cour&s;e, and argue on tho&s;e points, which he under&s;tood very well, only for the trouble of contending; and could never im|po&s;e upon him&s;elf the pain, that was nece&s;&s;ary to be undergone in &s;uch a

But in his pure zeal and affection for the Crown, and the con&s;cience, that in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> this conjuncture his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion might advance the King's Service, and that the refu&s;ing it might prove di&s;advantagious to his Maje&s;ty, he very chearfully undertook the Province, to the general &s;atisfaction and pub|lick joy of the whole Kingdom; and to the no little honour and credit of the Court, that &s;o important and beloved a per&s;on would Attach him|&s;elf to it under &s;uch a relation, when &s;o many, who had &s;carce ever ea|ten any bread but the King's, Detached them&s;elves from their depen|dance, that they might without him, and Again&s;t him, pre&s;erve and im|prove tho&s;e Fortunes, which they had procured and gotten Under him, and by his Bounty.</P>

They told him, there were two matters of great Importance pre&s;&s;ed upon him for his Royal A&s;&s;ent, but they were not of equal con&s;equence, and concernment to his Soveraign Power; the fir&s;t, that Bill touch|ing the Bi&s;hops Votes; the other, the whole Militia of the King|dom, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the granting of which would ab&s;olutely deve&s;t him of all Re|gal Power; that he would not be able to deny Both; but by grant|ing the former, in which he parted with no matter of Moment, he would, it may be, not be pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd; or if he were, that as he could not have a more Popular quarrel to take up Arms, than to defend him&s;elf, and pre&s;erve that power in his hands, which the Law had ve&s;ted in him, and without which he could not be a King; &s;o he could not have a more Unpopular argument for that contention, than the pre&s;ervation of the Bi&s;hops in the Hou&s;e of Peers, which few men thought E&s;&s;ential, and mo&s;t men believed Prejudicial, to the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> peace and happine&s;s of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THESE arguments, tho&punc; u&s;ed by men whom he mo&s;t tru&s;ted, and whom he knew to have oppo&s;ed that Bill in its pa&s;&s;age, and to be cor|dially friends to the Church of <HI>England</HI> in Di&s;cipline and Doctrine, prevailed not &s;o much with his Maje&s;ty, as the Per&s;wa&s;ions of the Queen; who was not only per&s;waded to think tho&s;e rea&s;ons valid (and there are that believe that infu&s;ion to have been made in her by her own Prie&s;ts, by In&s;tructions from <HI>France,</HI> and for rea&s;ons of State of that Kingdom) but that her own &s;afety very much depended upon the King's con&s;ent to That Bill; and that, if he &s;hould refu&s;e it, her Jour|ney <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> into <HI>Holland</HI> would be cro&s;&s;ed by the Parliament, and po&s;&s;ibly her Per&s;on in danger either by the Tumult, which might ea&s;ily be brought to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> or by the in&s;urrection of the Countries in her pa&s;&s;age from thence to <HI>Dover,</HI> where &s;he intended to take &s;hipping.

<P>THE pa&s;&s;ing that Bill for taking away the Bi&s;hops Votes, exceed|ingly weaken'd the King's Party; not only as it &s;wept away &s;o con|&s;iderable a number out of the Hou&s;e of Peers, which were con&s;tant|ly devoted to him; but as it made impre&s;&s;ion on others, who&s;e minds were in &s;u&s;pence, as when Foundations are &s;haken. Be&s;ides, they that were be&s;t acquainted with the King's nature, opinions, and re&s;olu|tions, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> had rea&s;on to believe, that no exigence could have wrought upon him to have con&s;ented to &s;o Anti-Monarchical an Act; and there|fore, never after retained any confidence, that he would deny what was Importunately asked; and &s;o, either ab&s;olutely withdrew them|&s;elves from tho&s;e con&s;ultations, thereby avoiding the envy, and the danger of oppo&s;ing them, or quietly &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be carried by the Stream, and to con&s;ent to any thing that was Boldly and Lu&s;tily attempted.</P>
<P>AND then it was &s;o far from dividing the other Party, that I do not remember One man, who vehemently in&s;i&s;ted on, or indeed heartily <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> wi&s;hed, the pa&s;&s;ing of that Bill, that ever de&s;erted them, till the King|dom was in a flame: but on the contrary, very many, who cordially and con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed that Act, as freinds rather to Monarchy than Religion, after that Bill, never con&s;idered or re&s;i&s;ted any attempt, or further alteration, in the Church, looking on the Bi&s;hops as u&s;ele&s;s to Soveraignty, and &s;o not of importance enough to be defended by the Sword. And I have heard the &s;ame men, who urged Before, <Q>&startq;&endq;that their places in that Hou&s;e had no relation to the Di&s;cipline of the Church, and their Spiritual Juri&s;diction, and therefore ought to be Sacrificed to the Pre&s;ervation of the other, upon which the Peace, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and unity of Religion &s;o much depended, Since argue, "that Since their power in that Hou&s;e, which was a good Outwork to defend the King's from inva&s;ion, was taken away, any other form of Govern|ment would be equally advantagious to his Maje&s;ty; and therefore, that he ought not to in&s;i&s;t on it, with the lea&s;t inconvenience to his condition.</Q></P>
<P>BUT that which was above, or equal to all this, was that by his Maje&s;ty's enacting tho&s;e two Bills, he had, upon the matter, approved the Circum&s;tances of their pa&s;&s;age, which had been by direct violence, and allmo&s;t force of armes; in which ca&s;e, he ought not to have con|firmed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the mo&s;t Politick, or the mo&s;t Pious con&s;titutions: <HI>Male po|&s;ita e&s;t Lex, quae tumultuarie po&s;ita e&s;t,</HI> was one of tho&s;e po&s;itions of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which hath Never been &s;ince contradicted; and was an advantage, that, being well managed, and &s;toutly in&s;i&s;ted upon, would, in &s;pight of all their Machinations, which were not Yet firmly and &s;olidly formed, have brought them to a temper of being Treated with. But I have &s;ome cau&s;e to believe, that even this argument, which was Unan&s;werable for the Rejecting that Bill, was applied for the Con|firming it; and an opinion that the violence, and force, u&s;ed in pro|curing it, render'd it ab&s;olutely Invalid and Void, made the Confirma|tion <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of it le&s;s con&s;idered, as not being of &s;trength to make that Act good, which was in it Self Null. And I doubt this Logick had an influence upon other Acts of no le&s;s Moment than the&s;e: but it was an Erroneous and Unskilful &s;ugge&s;tion; for an Act of Parliament,

looked upon as a Fugitive, they made no &s;cruple of opening it; and finding another in it directed to the Queen, after a very little pau&s;e they did the like; for which they made no other excu&s;e (when upon a Me&s;&s;age from the King they &s;ent her the tran&s;cript, for the Original they &s;till kept) than, <Q>&startq;&endq;that having opened the other Letters, and finding in them &s;undry expre&s;&s;ions full of a&s;perity, and malignity to the Parlia|ment, they thought it very probable, that the like might be contained in that to her Maje&s;ty; and that it would have been di&s;honourable to her Maje&s;ty, and dangerous to the Kingdom, if it &s;hould not have been opened: And they be&s;ought the King to per&s;wade her Maje&s;ty, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;he would not vouch&s;afe any countenance to, or corre&s;pondence with, the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> or any other of the Fugitives or Traytors, who&s;e offences were under the examination and judgment of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>IN that Letter to the Queen were the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;&endq;If the King be|take him&s;elf to a &s;afe place, where he may avow and protect his &s;er|vants (from rage I mean and violence; for from ju&s;tice I will never implore it) I &s;hall then live in impatience, and in mi&s;ery, till I wait upon you. But if, after all he hath done of late, he &s;hall betake him|&s;elf to the ea&s;ie&s;t and complyante&s;t ways of accommodation, I am confident, that then I &s;hall &s;erve him more by my ab&s;ence, than by <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> all&punc; my indu&s;try. And in that to S^r <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> were the&s;e words: God knows, I have not a thought to make me blu&s;h towards my Country, much le&s;s criminal; but where Traytors have &s;o great a &s;way,</Q> the hone&s;te&s;t thoughts may prove mo&s;t Trea&s;onable.

he &s;hould not undergo any imputation by the ra&s;h and indi&s;creet ex|pre&s;&s;ions of any young men then in his train, or by any de&s;perate words utter'd by others, who might mingle with them without His con&s;ent or approbation.</Q></P>

And &s;ince the ground of their reque&s;t to him was to &s;ecure their pre&s;ent Fears and Jealou&s;ies, that they might with &s;afety apply them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to his Me&s;&s;age of the 20^t^h of <HI>January,</HI> he hoped that his Grace to them &s;ince that time, in yielding to &s;o many of their de&s;ires, and in agreeing to the per&s;ons now recommended to him, and the power before expre&s;&s;ed, to be placed in them, would wholely di&s;pel tho&s;e Fears and Jealou&s;ies; and he a&s;&s;ured them, that as he had applied this Unu&s;ual remedy to their Doubts; &s;o, if there &s;hould be cau&s;e, he would con|tinue the &s;ame to &s;uch time, as &s;hould be agreeable to the &s;ame care he now expre&s;&s;ed towards them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE &s;aid, he was &s;o far from receding from any thing he had pro|mi&s;ed, or intended to grant in his former An&s;wer, that he had hereby <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> con&s;ented to all that had been then asked of him by that Petition, con|cerning the Militia of the Kingdom, except that of <HI>London</HI> and the other Corporations; which was, to put the &s;ame into the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons, as &s;hould be recommended to him by both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment. And he doubted not but they, upon well weighing the particu|lars of that his An&s;wer, would find the &s;ame more &s;atisfactory to their ends, and the Peace and Welfare of all his good Subjects, than the way propo&s;ed by that intended Ordinance; to which, for tho&s;e rea&s;ons, he could not con&s;ent.</Q></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Hou&s;es Votes concern|ing the Mi|litia.</NOTE> I HAVE not known both Hou&s;es in more choler and rage, than upon the receiving this Me&s;&s;age, which came early to them on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>March.</HI> Now the day before had been &s;pent in pre|paring <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> all things ready for the execution of the Ordinance of the Mi|litia; They had Voted, and Re&s;olved, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was not any way again&s;t the Oath of Allegiance, that all the Commi&s;&s;ions to Leiutenants un|der the great Seal were Illegal, and Void; and that who&s;oever &s;hould

execute any power over the Militia by colour of any Commi&s;&s;ion of Lieutenancy, without con&s;ent of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, &s;hould be accounted a di&s;turber of the Peace of the Kingdom.</Q> Then they agreed upon this Propo&s;ition, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Kingdom Had been of late, and Still was, in &s;o evident and imminent danger, both from Enemies abroad, and a Popi&s;h and di&s;contented Party at home, that there was an urgent, and inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of putting his Maje&s;ty's Subjects into a po&s;ture of defence, for the &s;afeguard both of the King, and his People; and that the Lords and Commons, apprehending that danger, and being &s;en&s;ible of their own duty to provide a &s;uitable prevention, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> had, in &s;everal Petitions, addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty's for the ordering, and di&s;po&s;ing the Militia of the Kingdom in &s;uch a way, as was agreed upon, by the wi&s;dom of both Hou&s;es, to be mo&s;t proper for the pre&s;ent exigence of the Kingdom: Yet they could not obtain it; but his Maje&s;ty did &s;everal times refu&s;e to give his Royal a&s;&s;ent thereunto. Upon this Propo&s;ition, they Re&s;olved, "that in that ca&s;e of extreme danger, and of his Maje&s;ty&punc;s refu&s;al, the Ordinance agreed on by both Hou&s;es for the Militia did oblige the people, and ought to be obeyed, by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; and that &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould be Nominated Deputy Lieutenants, and ap|proved <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of by both Hou&s;es, &s;hould receive the commands of both Hou&s;es,</Q> to take upon them to execute their Offices.

<P>AND this likewi&s;e they cau&s;ed to be &s;peedily printed; le&s;t the King &s;hould be able to per&s;wade the Subjects, that an Order of theirs, with|out His con&s;ent, was no Law to compel their obedience. And from this la&s;t Re&s;olution, by which the Law of the Land, and con&s;equently the liberty of the Subject, was re&s;olved into a Vote of the two Hou&s;es, which pa&s;&s;ed without any di&s;pute or he&s;itation, all Sober men di&s;cerned the fatal period of both, and &s;aw a Foundation laid for all the Anarchy and Confu&s;ion, that hath followed. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The$r Order concerning <HI>Hull.</HI></NOTE> IT was now known, that the King was gone to <HI>York,</HI> which made them apprehend their Principality of <HI>Hull</HI> might be in danger; and therefore they immediately Re&s;olve, <Q>&startq;&endq;that no Forces what&s;oever &s;hall

<P>OF this, how gro&s;s and ridiculous &s;oever it appeared to wi&s;e men, they made a double u&s;e (be&s;ides the general impre&s;&s;ion in the People) the one to colour and countenance their Orders to their Governour there; the other, to make the King's re&s;idence in tho&s;e parts &s;u&s;pected and grievous, as if he came thither only to bring in forreign forces upon them. With the&s;e Alarms of forreign forces, they mingled other In|telligence of the Papi&s;ts in <HI>England,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that they had a purpo&s;e of making <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> an In&s;urrection;</Q> and therefore they proceeded in preparing a Bill to &s;ecure the per&s;ons of tho&s;e of the be&s;t quality, and greate&s;t intere&s;t, and injoyning the Oath of Supremacy to be taken with great rigour; and, among&s;t other &s;tratagems they had to humble the Papi&s;ts, I remember, upon an information that they u&s;ed their Prote&s;tant Tenants wor&s;e in the rai&s;ing their Rents, than they did tho&s;e of their own Religion, there was an Order, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they &s;hould not rai&s;e the Rents of their Tenants, above the rates that the Prote&s;tant Landlords adjoyning received from Their Tenants:</Q> by virtue of which, in &s;ome places, they undertook <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to determine what Rents their Tenants &s;hould pay to them. But, in this zeal again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, they could not endure that the King &s;hould have any &s;hare; and therefore, when they found, that his Maje&s;ty had publi&s;hed a Proclamation in his Journey towards <HI>York,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;commanding all the Judges, and Ju&s;tices of Peace, and other Officers, to put in due execution all the Laws, and Statutes of the Kingdom, again&s;t Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants,</Q> without favour or connivance, they pre&s;ently &s;ent for the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and examined them, <Q>&startq;&endq;why &s;even Prie&s;ts, who were in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and had been long Condemned,</Q> were not Executed? the rea&s;on whereof they well knew; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and when the Sheriffs &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they had received a Reprieve for them under the Kings hand,</Q> they publi&s;hed that with great care in their prints, to take off the credit of the new Proclamation; and appointed their Me&s;&s;engers, whom they were then &s;ending to the King with a new Declaration, to move his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would take off his Re|prieve, and &s;uffer tho&s;e &s;even condemn&punc;d Prie&s;ts to be Executed, ac|cording to the Judgments they had received.</Q></P>
<P>THEY proceeded now to provide all nece&s;&s;ary means for the rai&s;ing great &s;ums of money, by the diligent collection of what was granted by former Acts, and by a new Bill for the rai&s;ing of four hundred <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> thou&s;and pounds, for the payment of the great debts of the Kingdom (by which they meant the remainder of the three hundred thou&s;and pounds, they had bountifully given to their Brethren of <HI>Scotland)</HI> and the &s;upport of the War of <HI>Ireland:</HI> All which monies were to be re|ceived, and di&s;po&s;ed as the two Hou&s;es &s;hould direct; of which tho'

the King &s;aw the danger, that might, and Did after en&s;ue thereupon, yet he thought that probable inconvenience and mi&s;chief to be le&s;s, than that, which the &s;candal of denying any thing, upon which the recovery of <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;eem'd to depend, would inevitably bring upon him; and &s;o ratified what&s;oever they brought to him of that Kind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They make Prepo&s;itions for Adven|turers in <HI>Ire|land.</HI></NOTE> AMONGST other Expedients for rai&s;ing of money for the War of <HI>Ireland,</HI> about this time, they made certain Propo&s;itions to incourage men to be Adventurers in that Traffick, Thus: They concluded <Q>&startq;&endq;that, in &s;o general a Rebellion, very much land mu&s;t E&s;cheat to the Crown by the forfeiture of Trea&s;on, and that, out of &s;uch forfeitures, &s;ati&s;|faction <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> might be given to tho&s;e, who &s;hould disbur&s;e money towards the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Rebels; &s;o many Acres of Land to be allowed for &s;o much money, according to the value of the Lands in the &s;e|veral Provinces,</Q> which was &s;pecified in the Propo&s;itions; which, having pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, were pre&s;ented to the King, who (it being about the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> when the breach of their Priviledges rung in all mens ears) An&s;wered, <Q>&startq;&endq;that as he had offer&punc;d, and was &s;till ready to venture, his own Per&s;on for the recovery of that Kingdom, if his Parliament &s;hould advi&s;e him thereunto; &s;o he would not deny to contribute any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could to that Service, by parting <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> with any profit or advantage of his own there; and therefore, relying<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King $word$ to them.</NOTE> upon the wi&s;dom of his Parliament, he did con&s;ent to every Propo|&s;ition, now made to him, without taking time to con&s;ider, and exa|mine, whether that cour&s;e might not retard the reducing that King|dom, by exa&s;perating the Rebels, and rendering them de&s;perate of be|ing received into Grace, if they &s;hould return to their obedience. And, he &s;aid, he would be ready to give his Royal a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch Bills, as &s;hould be tender&punc;d to him by his Parliament for the confirmation of tho&s;e Propo&s;itions.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH An&s;wer, together with their Propo&s;itions, they cau&s;ed forth-with <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to be Printed; made their Committees, in all places, to &s;ollicite Sub&s;criptions, and to receive the monies, the Principal and mo&s;t Active per&s;ons Sub&s;cribing fir&s;t, for the example of others; and delayed the framing, and pre&s;enting the Bill to the King, till they had received great &s;ums of money, and procured very many per&s;ons of all conditions to Sub&s;cribe, many coming in out of pure covetou&s;ne&s;s to rai&s;e great fortunes; five hundred Acres of Land being a&s;&s;igned for one hundred pound in &s;ome Counties, and not much under that proportion in others: &s;ome out of pure fear, and to win credit with the Powerful Party, which made this new project a mea&s;ure of mens affections, and a tryal how <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> far they might be tru&s;ted, and relied on.</P>
<P>THEN they &s;ent tho&s;e Propo&s;itions dige&s;ted into a Bill to the King, with &s;uch Clau&s;es of power to Them, and diminution of his own, that, upon the matter, he put the making a Peace with the Rebels there out<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of his power, tho' upon the mo&s;t advantagious terms; which he was likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;itated to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e preparations on This &s;ide the Sea, the relief, and provi&s;ion was very &s;lowly &s;upplied to the Other &s;ide; where the Rebels &s;till increa&s;ed in &s;trength, and, by the &s;ame of the&s;e Propo&s;itions, inlarged their power, very many per&s;ons of Honour, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> fortune, who till then had &s;ate &s;till, and either were, or &s;eemed to be aver&s;e to the Rebellion, joining with them, as being de&s;perate, and con|ceiving the utter &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Religion, and the very extirpation
<PB N="357" REF="3770">
of their Nation, to be decreed again&s;t them. And, without doubt, the great Reformers here were willing enough to drive them to any extre|mity, both out of revenge and contempt, as a people ea&s;y to be rooted out, and that the War might be kept up &s;till; &s;ince they feared an Union in That Kingdom might much prejudice their de&s;igns in This, both as it might &s;upply the King with power, and take away much of Theirs; whereas Now they had opportunity, with reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to rai&s;e both men and money, which they might be able to imploy upon more pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions, as they will be found afterwards to have <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> done. Neither was it out of their expectation and view, that, by the King's con&s;enting to that &s;evere Decree, he might very probably di&s;|courage his Catholick Subjects, in his other Dominions, from any extra|ordinary Acts of duty, and affection: at lea&s;t, that it would render him le&s;s con&s;idered by mo&s;t Catholick Princes. And they knew well what u&s;e to make of any diminution of his intere&s;t, or reputation. The&s;e matters thus &s;etled, for the ea&s;e of the two Hou&s;es, who were now like to have much to do, they appointed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland</HI> to be managed by Commi&s;&s;ion under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by four Lords and eight Commoners, whom they recommended to the King, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and who were allways to receive In&s;tructions from Them&s;elves.

<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> _ASSOON as the King came to <HI>Tork,</HI> which was about the end of the year 1641, and found his reception there to be equal to his expectation, the Gentry, and men of Ability of that great and populous County (&s;ome very few excepted) expre&s;&s;ing great alacrity for his Maje&s;ty's being with them, and no le&s;s &s;en&s;e of the in&s;olent proceedings of the Par|liament; thereupon, he re&s;olved to treat with the two Hou&s;es in an other manner than he had done, and to let them clearly know, <Q>&startq;&endq;that as he would deny them nothing that was fit for Them to Ask, &s;o he would yield to nothing that was unrea&s;onable for Him to Grant; and that he would have no|thing extorted from him, that he was not very well inclined to con|&s;ent to.</Q> So, within few days after his coming thither, he &s;ent them a Declaration (which he cau&s;ed to be printed, and, in the Fronti&s;piece, recommended to the con&s;ideration of all his loving Subjects) in An|&s;wer to that pre&s;ented to him at <HI>New-Market</HI> &s;ome days before: He told them,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Maje&s;ty; Declaration from</HI> York, Mar. 9. 1641.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT, though that Declaration, pre&s;ented to him at <HI>New-Market</HI> from both Hou&s;es of Parliament, was of &s;o &s;trange a Nature, in re&s;pect of what he expected (after &s;o many Acts of grace and favour to his People) and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in it &s;o different from the u&s;ual Language to Princes, that he might well take a very long time to con&s;ider it; yet the clearne&s;s and uprightne&s;s of his con&s;cience to God, and love to his Subjects, had &s;upplied him with a &s;peedy An&s;wer; and his un|alterable affection to his People prevailed with him to &s;uppre&s;s that pa&s;&s;ion, which might well enough become him upon &s;uch invitation.
<PB N="362" REF="3800">
He &s;aid, he had recon&s;idered his An&s;wer of the fir&s;t of that Month at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> which was urged to have given ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;orrow to his Subjects; but, he &s;aid, whoever looked over that Me&s;&s;age (which was in effect to tell him, that if he would not joyn with them in an Act, which he conceived might prove prejudicial and dangerous to him, and the whole Kingdom, they would make a Law without him, and impo&s;e it upon his People) would not think that &s;uddain An&s;wer could be excepted to. He &s;aid, he had little incouragement to replies of that Nature, when he was told of how little Value his words were like to be with them, though they came accompanied with all the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Actions of Love, and Ju&s;tice (where there was room for Actions to accompany them) yet he could not but di&s;avow the having any &s;uch evil Coun&s;el, or Coun&s;ellors about him, to his knowledge, as were mentioned by them; and, if any &s;uch &s;hould be di&s;covered, he would leave them to the cen&s;ure, and judgment of his Parliament. In the mean time he could wi&s;h, that his own immediate Actions, which he did avow, and his own honour might not be &s;o roughly cen&s;ured and wounded, under that common &s;tyle of evil Coun&s;ellors. For his faith|full and zealous affection to the true Prote&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion, and his re|&s;olution to concur with his Parliament in any po&s;&s;ible cour&s;e for the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> propagation of It, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Popery, He &s;aid he could &s;ay no more than he had allready expre&s;&s;ed in his Declaration to all his loving Subjects, publi&s;hed in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, by the advice of his Privy Council; in which he endeavour'd to make as lively a confe&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf in that point, as he was able, being mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the con&s;tant practice of his life had been an&s;werable thereunto: And there|fore, he did rather expect a Te&s;timony, and acknowledgment of &s;uch his Zeal and Piety, than tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions he met with in that Decla|ration of any de&s;ign of altering Religion in this Kingdom. And he &s;aid, he did, out of the innocency of his Soul, wi&s;h, that the judg|ments <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of Heaven might be manife&s;ted upon tho&s;e, who have, or had any &s;uch de&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;As for the <HI>Scots</HI> Troubles, he told them, he had thought, that tho&s;e unhappy differences had been wrapp'd up in perpetual &s;ilence by the Act of Oblivion; which, being &s;olemnly pa&s;&s;ed in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, &s;top'd his own Mouth from any other reply, than to &s;hew his great di&s;like for reviving the Memory thereof. He &s;aid, if the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o odious to all Chri&s;tians, &s;eem'd to have been framed, and maintained in <HI>England,</HI> or to have any Countenance from hence, he conjured both his Hou&s;es of Parliament, and all his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> loving Subjects what&s;oever, to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to di&s;cover, and find &s;uch out, that he might joyn in the mo&s;t exemplary Vengeance upon them, that could be imagined. But, he told them, he mu&s;t think him&s;elf highly, and cau&s;le&s;&s;ly injured in his reputation, if any Declaration, Acton, or Expre&s;&s;ion, of the Iri&s;h Rebels; any Letters from the Count <HI>Rozetti</HI> to the Papi&s;ts, for Fa&s;ting and Praying; or from <HI>Tri&s;tram Whetcomb,</HI> of &s;trange Speeches uttered in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;hould beget any Jealou&s;y, or Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion in his Subjects of his Ju&s;tice, Piety, and Affection: it being evident to all under&s;tandings, that tho&s;e mi&s;chievous and wicked Rebels, are not &s;o capable of great <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> advantage, as by having their fal&s;e di&s;cour&s;es &s;o far believed, as to rai&s;e Fears and Jealou&s;ies to the di&s;traction of this Kingdom; the only way to their &s;ecurity. He &s;aid, he could not expre&s;s a deeper &s;en&s;e

of the &s;ufferings of his poor Prote&s;tant Subjects in that Kingdom, than he had done in his often Me&s;&s;ages to both Hou&s;es; by which he had offer'd,</Q> and was &s;till ready to venture his Royal Per&s;on for their re|demption, well knowing that as he was, in his own Intere&s;ts, <Q>more &startq;&endq;concerned in them; &s;o he was to make a &s;trict Account to Allmighty God for any neglect of His Duty,</Q> or their Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR the manifold Attempts to provoke his late Army, and the Army of the Scots, and to rai&s;e a Faction in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other parts of the Kingdom, if it were &s;aid as relating to Him, he could <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> not without great Indignation, &s;uffer him&s;elf to be reproached to have intended the lea&s;t force, or threatning to his Parliament; as the be|ing Privy to the bringing up the Army would imply. Whereas, he called God to Witne&s;s, he never had any &s;uch thought, nor knew of any &s;uch re&s;olution concerning his late Army. For the Petition &s;hewed to him by Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> he &s;aid, he well remember'd the &s;ame, and the occa&s;ion of that conference. Captain <HI>Leg</HI> being lately come out of the North, and repairing to him at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> his Maje&s;ty asked him of the &s;tate of his Army; and, after &s;ome relation of it, he told his Maje&s;ty, that the Commanders and Officers of the Army, had a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> mind to Petition the Parliament, as others of his People had done, and &s;hewed him the Copy of a Petition; which he read, and finding it to be very humble, de&s;iring the Parliament might receive no interruption in the Reformation of Church, and State, to the Model of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>'s days, his Maje&s;ty told him, that he &s;aw no harm in it; where|upon Captain <HI>Leg</HI> replied, that he believed all the Officers of the Ar|my would like it, only, he thought, S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hly</HI> would be unwilling to &s;ign it, out of fear that it might di&s;plea&s;e Him. His Maje&s;ty then read the Petition over again; and ob&s;erving nothing in Matter or Form he conceived could po&s;&s;ibly give ju&s;t cau&s;e of Offence, he deli|vered <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> it to him again, bidding him give it to S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hly,</HI> for who&s;e &s;atisfaction he writ C. R. upon it, to te&s;tify his Approbation; and he wi&s;hed that the Petition might be &s;een and publi&s;hed, and then he be|lieved it would appear no dangerous one, nor a ju&s;t ground for the lea&s;t Jealou&s;y,</Q> or Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR M^r <HI>Jermyn,</HI> he &s;aid, it was well known that he was gone from <HI>White-Hall,</HI> before he received the de&s;ire of both Hou&s;es for the re|&s;traint of his Servants; neither returned he thither, or pa&s;&s;ed over by any Warrant granted by him after that time. For the breach of Pri|viledge in the Accu&s;ation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Mem|bers <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of the Hou&s;e of Commons, he told them, he thought, he had given &s;o ample &s;atisfaction in his &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages to that purpo&s;e, that it &s;hould have been no more pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him; being confident, if the breach of Priviledge had been greater than ever had been before offer'd, his acknowledgment and retractation had been greater than ever King had given: be&s;ides the not examining how many of His Priviledges had been invaded in defence, and vindication of the other. And therefore, he hoped his true, and earne&s;t prote&s;tation in his An|&s;wer to their Order concerning the Militia, would &s;o far have &s;atisfied them of his Intentions then, that they would no more have enter|tained <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> any Imagination of any other de&s;ign, than he there expre&s;&s;ed. But why the li&s;ting &s;o many Officers, and entertaining them at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> &s;hould be mi&s;con&s;trued, he &s;aid, he much marvelled, when it was notoriou&s;ly known the Tumults at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> were &s;o great,
<PB N="364" REF="3820">
and their demeanour &s;o &s;eandalous and &s;editious, that he had good cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e his own Per&s;on, and tho&s;e of his Wife and Children, to be in apparent danger; and therefore, he had great rea&s;on to appoint a Guard about him, and to accept the dutiful tender of the &s;ervices of any of his loving Subjects, which was all he did to the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> he a&s;&s;ured them in the Word of a King, that he had his Warrant to pa&s;s the Seas, and had left his Court, Before ever he heard of the Vote of the Hou&s;e of Commons, or had any cau&s;e to imagin that his ab&s;ence would have been excepted again&s;t. What <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> their Adverti&s;ements were from <HI>Rome&punc; Venice, Paris,</HI> and other parts, or what the Pope&punc;s Nuntio &s;ollicits the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to do: or from what Per&s;ons &s;uch informations come to them, or how the credit and reputation of &s;uch per&s;ons had been &s;ifted and examined, he &s;aid, he knew not; but was confident no &s;ober hone&s;t man in his Kingdoms could believe, that he was &s;o de&s;perate, or &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, to entertain &s;uch de&s;igns, as would not only bury this his Kingdom in &s;uddain di&s;traction and ruin, but his own Name and Po&s;terity in per|petual Scorn, and Infamy. And therefore, he &s;aid, he could have wi&s;hed in matters of &s;o high and tender a Nature, wherewith the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> minds of h s good Subjects mu&s;t needs be &s;tartled, all the expre&s;&s;ions had been &s;o plain and ea&s;y, that nothing might &s;tick with them that reflected upon his Maje&s;ty,</Q> &s;ince they thought fit to publi&s;h it at all.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND having now dealt thus plainly and freely with them, by way of An&s;wer to the particular grounds of their Fears, he &s;aid, he hoped, upon a due con&s;ideration and weighing of both together, they would not find the grounds to be of that moment to beget, or longer to con|tinue, a mi&s;under&s;tanding between them; or force them to apply them&s;elves to the u&s;e of any other power, than what the Law had given them: the which he allways intended &s;hould be the mea&s;ure of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> his own Power, and expected it &s;hould be the rule of his Subjects Obe|dience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;CONCERNING his own Fears and Jealou&s;ies, as he had no Inten|tion of accu&s;ing them, &s;o he &s;aid, he was &s;ure no words &s;poken by him on the Suddain at <HI>Theobalds</HI> would bear that Interpretation. He had &s;aid, for his re&s;idence near them, he wi&s;hed it might be &s;o &s;afe and honourable, that he had no cau&s;e to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from <HI>White Hall;</HI> and how That could be a breach of Priviledge of Parliament he could not under&s;tand. He &s;aid, he had explained his meaning in his An&s;wer a^t <HI>New-Market,</HI> at the pre&s;entation of that Declaration, concerning <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the printed &s;editious Pamphlets, and Sermons, and the great Tumults at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> And he &s;aid, he mu&s;t appeal to them, and all the world, whether he might not ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf in danger of either. And i$ he were now at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he asked them, what &s;ecurity he had, that the like &s;hould not be Again? e&s;pecially if any Delinquents of that Nature had been apprehended by the Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, and had been re&s;cued by the people, and &s;o as yet had e&s;caped Unpuni&s;hed. He told them, if they had not yet been informed of the &s;editious words u&s;ed in, and the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Tumults, and would appoint &s;ome way for the examination of them, he would require <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;ome of his learned Coun&s;el to attend with &s;uch Evidence as might $word$ them; and till that were done, or &s;ome other cour&s;e &s;hould be taken for his &s;ecurity, he &s;aid, they could not with rea&s;on won|der,</Q>
<PB N="365" REF="3830">
that he intended not to be, where he mo&s;t de&s;ired to be.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE asked them, whether there could Yet want evidence of his hearty and importunate de&s;ire to joyn with his Parliament, and all his faithful Subjects, in defence of the Religion, and publick good of the Kingdom? Whether he had given them no other earne&s;t but Words, to &s;ecure them of tho&s;e de&s;ires? He told them the very Remon&s;trance of the Hou&s;e of Commons (publi&s;hed in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t) of the State of the Kingdom allowed him a more Real Te&s;timony of his good Af|fections, than Words; that Remon&s;trance valued his Acts of Grace and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Ju&s;tice at &s;o high a rate, that it declared the Kingdom to be Then a Garner, tho' it had charged it &s;elf by Bills of Sub&s;idies and Poll-money, with the levy of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides the contracting a debt of two hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds more to his Sub|ject$ of <HI>Scotland.</HI> He asked them, whether the Bills for the Triennial Parliament, for relinqui&s;hing his Title of impo&s;ing upon Merchandize, and power of pre&s;&s;ing of Soldiers, for the taking away the Star-Cham|ber, and High-Commi&s;&s;ion Courts, for the regulating the Coun&s;el Ta|ble, were but Words? whether the Bills for the Forre&s;ts, the Stannery Courts, the Clarke of the Market, and the taking away the Votes of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Bi&s;hops out of the Lord's Hou&s;e, were but Words? La&s;tly, what greater earne&s;t of his tru&s;t, and relyance on his Parliament could he give, than the pa&s;&s;ing the Bill for the continuance of this Pre&s;ent Parliament? The Length of which, he &s;aid, he hoped, would never alter the Na|ture of Parliaments, and the Con&s;titution of this Kingdom; or invite his Subjects So much to abu&s;e his Confidence, as to e&s;teem any thing fit for this Parliament to do, which were not fit, if it were in his power to Di&s;&s;olve it to Morrow. And after all the&s;e, and many other Acts of Grace on his part, that he might be &s;ure of a perfect reconciliation between him and all his Subjects, he had offer'd, and was &s;till ready to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> grant, a free, and general pardon, as ample as them&s;elves &s;hould think fit. Now if tho&s;e were not real expre&s;&s;ions of the Affections of his Soul for the Publick Good of this Kingdom, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t confe&s;s that he wanted skill to manife&s;t them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;TO conclude, alltho' he thought his An&s;wer allready full to that point concerning his return to <HI>London,</HI> he told them, that he was willing to declare, that he looked upon it as a matter of &s;o great weight, as with reference to the affairs of this Kingdom, and to his own incli|nations and de&s;ires, that if all he could Say, or Do, could rai&s;e a mu|tual Confidence (the only way, with Gods ble&s;&s;ing, to make them all <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> happy) and, by their incouragement, the Laws of the Land, and the Government of the City of <HI>London,</HI> might recover &s;ome life for his &s;ecurity; he would overtake their de&s;ires, and be a&s;&s;oon with them, as they could wi&s;h. And in the mean time, he would be &s;ure that nei|ther the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor any other advantage for This Kingdom &s;hould &s;uffer through His Default, or by his Ab&s;ence; he being &s;o far from repenting the Acts of his Ju&s;tice and Grace, which he had all|ready performed to his people, that, he &s;aid, he &s;hould, with the &s;ame alacrity, be &s;till ready to add &s;uch New ones, as might be&s;t advance the Peace,</Q> Honour, and Pro&s;perity of this Nation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> THEY who now read this Declaration, and remember only the in&s;o|lent, and un$utiful Expre&s;&s;ions in that Declaration, to which this was an $word$ and the more in&s;olent and &s;editious Actions which preceded, accompamed, and attended it, may think, that the &s;tyle was not an|&s;werable

to the Provocation, nor Princely enough for &s;uch a Conte&s;t; and may believe, that if his Maje&s;ty had then expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with more Indignation for what he had &s;uffer'd, and more Re&s;olution, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would No More endure tho&s;e &s;ufferings,</Q> they who were not Yet grown to the hardine&s;s of Avowing the contempt of the King (and mo&s;t of them having de&s;igns to be great With, and By Him, whom they pro|voked) would &s;ooner have been checked, and recovered their Loyalty and Obedience. But they again who con&s;ider and remember that Juncture of time, the incredible di&s;advantage his Maje&s;ty &s;uffer'd by the mi&s;un|der&s;tanding of his going to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and by the Popular <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> mi&s;take of Priviledge of Parliament, and con&s;equently of the breach of tho&s;e Priviledges: And, on the contrary, the great height and reputa|tion the Factious Party had arrived to, the &s;tratagems they u&s;ed, and the infu&s;ions they made into the people, <Q>&startq;&endq;of the Kings di&s;inclination to the Laws of the Land; and e&s;pecially, "that he had con&s;ented to all tho&s;e excellent Laws made this Parliament (of which the people were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed) very unwillingly, and meant to avoid them: That the Queen had an irreconcilable Hatred to the Religion profe&s;&s;ed, and to the whole Nation, and that her Power was unque&s;tionable: That there was a de&s;ign to &s;end the Prince beyond the Seas, and to marry <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> him to &s;ome Papi&s;t:</Q> Above all (which the principal of them, with wonderful confidence, in all places avowed to be true) <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Re|bellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was fomented, and countenanced at lea&s;t, by the Queen,</Q> that good terms might be got for the Catholicks in <HI>England:</HI> I &s;ay, whoever remembers all this, and, that though it might be pre|&s;umed, that the exorbitancy of the Parliament might be very offen&s;ive to &s;ome &s;ober and di&s;cerning men, yet his Maje&s;ty had no rea&s;on to pre|&s;ume of their eminent and vehement Zeal on his behalf, &s;ince he &s;aw all tho&s;e (&s;ome few only excepted) from whom he might challenge the duty, and faith of &s;ervants <HI>u&s;que ad aras,</HI> and for who&s;e &s;ake he had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> undergone many difficulties, either totally aliened from his &s;ervice, and ingaged Again&s;t him, or, like men in a Trance, unapplicable to it: He will, I &s;ay, conclude that it concerned his Maje&s;ty, by all gentlene&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, to undeceive, and recover men to their &s;obriety and under&s;tanding, before he could hope to make them apprehen&s;ive of their own duty, or the reverence that was due to him; and therefore, that he was to de&s;cend to all po&s;&s;ible Arts, and Means to that purpo&s;e, it be|ing very evident, that men would no &s;ooner di&s;cern his Princely Ju&s;tice and Clemency, than they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the Indignities which were offer'd to him; and incen&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e, who were the Authors of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> them.</P>
<P>AND the truth is (which I &s;peak knowingly) at that time, the King's Re&s;olution was to Shelter him&s;elf wholely under the Law; to grant any thing, that by the Law he was obliged to grant; and to deny, what by the Law was in his own power, and which he found inconvenient to con&s;ent to; and to oppo&s;e and puni&s;h any extravagant attempt by the force and power of the Law, pre&s;uming that the King and the Law to|gether would have been &s;trong enough for any encounter that could happen; and that the Law was &s;o &s;en&s;ible a thing, that the People would ea&s;ily perceive who endeavoured to Pre&s;erve, and who to Suppre&s;s it, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves accordingly.</P>

And <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> yet, they &s;aid, they had not been alltogether negligent of either, having lately made good proceedings in preparing a Book of Rates, to be pa&s;&s;ed in a Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, and likewi&s;e the mo&s;t material heads of tho&s;e humble de&s;ires, which they intended to make to his Maje&s;ty for the good and contentment of his Maje&s;ty and his People; but none of tho&s;e could be perfected before the Kingdom be put in &s;afety, by &s;etling the Militia: And until his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be plea&s;ed to concur with his Parliament in tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things, they held it impo&s;&s;ible for his Maje&s;ty to give the world, or his People, &s;uch &s;ati&s;|faction concerning the Fears and Jealou&s;ies, which they had expre&s;&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> as they hoped his Maje&s;ty had allready received touching that ex|ception, which he was plea&s;ed to take to M^r <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech. As for his Maje&s;ty's Fears and Doubts, the ground whereof was from &s;editious Pamphlets and Sermons, they &s;aid, they &s;hould be as careful to endea|vour the removal of them, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould under&s;tand what Pam|phlets and Sermons were by his Maje&s;ty intended, as they had been to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any extraordinary Concour&s;e of people out of the City to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had the face and &s;hew of Tu|mult and Danger, in his Maje&s;ty's apprehen&s;ion, it would appear to be cau&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's denial of &s;uch a Guard to his Parliament, as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> they might have cau&s;e to Confide in; and by taking into <HI>White-Hall</HI> &s;uch a Guard for Him&s;elf, as gave ju&s;t cau&s;e of Jealou&s;y to the Parlia|ment, and of Terrour and Offence to his People. They told him, they &s;ought nothing but his Maje&s;ty's Honour, and the Peace and Pro&s;pe|rity of his Kingdoms; and that they were heartily &s;orry, they had &s;uch plentiful matter for an An&s;wer to that Que&s;tion, whether his Ma|je&s;ty had violated their Laws?

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;TO his Maje&s;ty's next Que&s;tion, whether he had denied any Bill for the ea&s;e and &s;ecurity of his Subjects?

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND if his Maje&s;ty had asked them the third Que&s;tion intimated in that Speech, what They had done for Him? they told him, their An&s;wer would have been much more ea&s;y; That they had paid two Armies with which the Kingdom was burthen'd the la&s;t year, and had undergone the Charge of the War in <HI>Ireland</HI> at this time, when, through many other exce&s;&s;ive Charges and pre&s;&s;ures, his Subjects had been ex|hau&s;ted, and the &s;tock of the Kingdom very much dimini&s;hed; which great mi&s;chiefs, and the charges thereupon en&s;uing, had been occa|&s;ioned by the evil Coun&s;els &s;o powerful with his Maje&s;ty, which had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and would co&s;t this Kingdom more than two Millions; all which, in ju&s;tice,</Q> ought to have been born by his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AS for that free and general pardon his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to offer, they &s;aid, it could be no &s;ecurity to their Fears and Jealou&s;ies, for which his Maje&s;ty &s;eem'd to propound it; becau&s;e they aro&s;e not from any Guilt of their own Actions, but from the evil de&s;igns, and attempts of others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;TO that their Humble An&s;wer to that Speech, they de&s;ired to add an Information, which they had lately received from the Deputy Go|vernour of the Merchant Adventurers at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> an unknown per&s;on, appertaining to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> did lately &s;ollicit one <HI>James Henly</HI> a Marriner, to go to <HI>El&s;enore,</HI> and to take charge of a Ship in the Fleet of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> there prepared; which he &s;hould conduct to <HI>Hull.</HI> In which Fleet likewi&s;e, he &s;aid, a great Army was to be tran&s;ported; and alltho' they were not apt to give credit to Informations of that Nature, yet they could not alltogether think it fit to be neglected; but that it might ju&s;tly add &s;omewhat to the weight of their Fears and Jealou&s;ies, con&s;idering with what cir|cum&s;tances it was accompanied; with the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s preceding ex|pre&s;&s;ions in his Letter to her Maje&s;ty, and S^r <HI>Lewis Dives;</HI> and his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Maje&s;ty's &s;ucceeding cour&s;e of withdrawing him&s;elf North-ward from his Parliament, in a manner very &s;uitable and corre&s;pondent to that evil Coun&s;el; which they doubted, would make much deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion in the generality of his People: and therefore, they mo&s;t hum|bly advi&s;ed, and be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, for the procuring and &s;etling the confidence of his Parliament and all his Subjects, and for the other important rea&s;ons concerning the recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;ecuring This Kingdom, which had been formerly pre&s;ented to him, he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, with all convenient &s;peed, to return to tho&s;e Ports, and to clo&s;e with the Coun&s;el and de&s;ire of his Parliament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> where he &s;hould find their dutiful affections and endeavours ready to attend his Maje&s;ty with &s;uch entertainment, as &s;hould not only give him ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;ecurity in their faithfulne&s;s, but other manifold

<P>THIS, which They called a Petition, being pre&s;ented to the King, his Maje&s;ty immediately returned, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;engers, his An&s;wer in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IF you would have had the patience to have expected our An&s;wer<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer</NOTE> to your la&s;t Declaration (which, con&s;idering the nature of it, hath <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> not been long in coming) We believe, you would have &s;aved your &s;elves the labour of &s;aying much of this Me&s;&s;age. And We could wi&s;h, that our Priviledges on all parts were &s;o &s;tated, that this way of Cor|re&s;pondency might be pre&s;erved with that freedom, which hath been u&s;ed of old. For We mu&s;t tell you, that if you may ask Any thing of us by Me&s;&s;age or Petition, and in what Language (how Unu&s;ual &s;oever) you think fit, and we mu&s;t neither Deny the thing you ask, nor give a rea&s;on why we cannot Grant it, without being taxed of breaking your Priviledges, or being Coun&s;elled by tho&s;e, who are Ene|mies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and favourers of the Iri&s;h Rebel|lion <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> (for we have &s;een your printed Votes upon our Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Huntington)</HI> you will reduce all our An&s;wers hereafter into a very little room; in plain Engli&s;h, it is to take away the freedom of our Vote; which, were We but a Subject, were high Inju&s;tice, but being your King,</Q> we leave all the world to judge What it is.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IS this the way to compo&s;e all mi&s;under&s;tandings? We thought, we &s;hewed you one, by our Me&s;&s;age of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> if you have a better or readier, We &s;hall willingly hearken to it, for hitherto you have &s;hewed us None. But why the refu&s;al to con&s;ent to your Order, which You call a Denial of the Militia, &s;hould be any <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> interruption to it, we cannot under&s;tand. For the Militia, which we allways thought nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;etled, we never denied the Thing (as we told you in our An&s;wer of the 28 of <HI>January)</HI> to the Petition of the Hou&s;e of Commons, for we accepted the Per&s;ons, except for Corporations; we only denied the Way. You ask it by way of Ordi|nance, and with &s;uch a Preface, as we can neither with ju&s;tice to our Honour, or Innocency con&s;ent to. You exclude Us from any power in the di&s;po&s;ition or execution of it together with you, and for a time utterly Unlimited. We tell you, we would have the Thing done; allow the Per&s;ons, with that exception; de&s;ire a Bill, the only Good <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Old way of impo&s;ing on our &s;ubjects: We are extremely un&s;atisfied what an Ordinance is, but well &s;atisfied, that without Our Con&s;ent it is Nothing, nor Binding&punc; and it is evident by the long time &s;pent in this Argument, the nece&s;&s;ity and danger was not &s;o imminent, but a Bill might have been prepared; which if it &s;hall Yet be done, with that due regard to Us, and care of our People, in the limitation of the power and other circum&s;tances, we &s;hall recede from nothing we for|merly expre&s;&s;ed in that An&s;wer to your Order; otherwi&s;e, we mu&s;t declare to all the world, that we are not &s;atisfied with, or &s;hall ever allow our Subjects to be bound by, your printed Votes of the fifteenth <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> or &s;ixteenth of this Month; or that under pretence of Declaring what the Law of the Land is, you &s;hall, without Us, make a New Law, which is plainly the ca&s;e of the Militia: and what is this but to intro|duce an Arbitrary way of Government?</Q></P>

<Q>&startq;&endq;CONCERNING <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech, you will have found, by what the Lord <HI>Compton</HI> and M^r <HI>Baynton</HI> brought from Us in An&s;wer to that Me&s;&s;age they brought to Us, that, as yet, we re&s;t nothing &s;atisfied in that particular.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AS for the &s;editious Pamphlets and Sermons, We are both &s;orry and a&s;hamed (in &s;o great variety, and in which our Rights, Honour, and Authority, are &s;o in&s;olently &s;lighted and vilified, and in which the dignity and freedom of Parliaments is &s;o much invaded, and vio|lated) it &s;hould be asked of Us to name any. The mentioning of the Prote&s;tation prote&s;ted, the Apprentices Prote&s;tation, <HI>To your Tents O I&s;rael,</HI> or any other, would be too great an excu&s;e for the re&s;t: If <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> you think them not worth your enquiry, We have done. But We think it mo&s;t &s;trange to be told, that our denial of a Guard (which We yet never denied, but granted in an other manner, and under a Com|mand at that time mo&s;t accu&s;tomed in the Kingdom) or the denial of any thing el&s;e (which is in our power legally to deny) which in our under&s;tanding, of which God hath &s;urely given us &s;ome u&s;e, is not fit to be granted, &s;hould be any excu&s;e for &s;o dangerous a Concour&s;e of People; which, not only in Our apprehen&s;ion, but, We believe, in the interpretation of the Law it &s;elf, hath been allways held mo&s;t Tumul|tuous, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and Seditious. And We mu&s;t wonder, what, and whence come the In&s;tructions and Informations, that tho&s;e People have, who can &s;o ea&s;ily think them&s;elves obliged by the Prote&s;tation to A&s;&s;emble in &s;uch a manner for the defence of Priviledges, which cannot be &s;o clear|ly known to any of them, and &s;o negligently pa&s;s over the con&s;idera|tion, and defence of our Rights, &s;o beneficial and nece&s;&s;ary for them|&s;elves, and &s;carce unknown to any of them; which by their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and even by the &s;ame Prote&s;tation, they are at lea&s;t Equally obliged to defend. And what interruptions &s;uch kind of A&s;&s;emblies may be to the freedom of future Parliaments (if <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> not &s;ea&s;onably di&s;countenanced and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed) We mu&s;t advi&s;e you to con&s;ider; as likewi&s;e, whether both our Rights and Powers may not by &s;uch means be u&s;urped, by hands not tru&s;ted by the Con&s;titu|tion of this Kingdom.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BY that Que&s;tion of violating your Laws, by which We endeavour'd to expre&s;s our care, and re&s;olution to ob&s;erve them&punc; We did not expect, you would have been invited to have looked back &s;o many years, for which you have had &s;o ample reparation, neither looked we to have been reproached with the Actions of our Mini&s;ters Then again&s;t the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Laws, whil&s;t we expre&s;s &s;o great Zeal for the Pre&s;ent Defence of them; it being our re&s;olution, upon ob&s;ervation of the mi&s;chief which then grew by Arbitrary Power (tho' made plau&s;ible to us by the &s;ugge&s;tions of Nece&s;&s;ity and imminent Danger, and take you heed, You fall not into the &s;ame error, upon the &s;ame &s;ugge&s;tions) hereafter to keep the Rule Our &s;elf, and to Our Power require the &s;ame from all others. But above all, We mu&s;t be more &s;en&s;ible of what you ca&s;t upon us for requital of tho&s;e good Bills, you cannot deny. We have denied any &s;uch de&s;ign; and as God Allmighty mu&s;t judge in that point between us, who knows our upright intentions at the pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Laws, &s;o <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> in the mean time we defy the Devil to prove, that there was any de|&s;ign (with Our Knowledge, or Privity) in or about the time of pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Bills, that, had it taken effect, could have deprived Our Subjects
<PB N="371" REF="3890">

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WE are far from denying what you have done; for We acknow|ledge the charge Our People hath &s;u&s;tained in keeping the two Armies, and in relieving <HI>Ireland;</HI> of which we are &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that in regard of tho&s;e great burthens Our People hath undergone, We have, and do patiently &s;uffer tho&s;e extreme Per&s;onal Wants, as our Predece&s;&s;ors have <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> been &s;eldom put to, rather than We would pre&s;s upon them; which we hope in time,</Q> will be con&s;idered on your parts.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IN our offer of a general pardon, our intent was to compo&s;e and &s;e|cure the general condition of our Subjects, conceiving that, in the&s;e times of great di&s;tractions, the good Laws of the Land have not been enough ob&s;erved; but it is a &s;trange world, when Princes proffered Favours are counted Reproaches; yet if you like not this Our offer, We have done.</Q></P>
<P>CONCERNING any di&s;cour&s;es of Forreign Forces, <Q>though We have &startq;&endq;given you a full An&s;wer in Ours to your la&s;t Declaration, yet We mu&s;t <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> tell you, we have neither &s;o ill an opinion of Our own merit, or the Affections of our good Subjects, as to think Our &s;elf in need of any For|reign Forces to pre&s;erve us from oppre&s;&s;ion; and we &s;hall not need for any other purpo&s;e: but are confident, through Gods providence, not to want the good wi&s;hes and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the whole Kingdom, be|ing re&s;olved to build upon that &s;ure Foundation, the Law of the Land; and we take it very ill, that General di&s;cour&s;es between an Unknown Per&s;on and a Marriner, or inferences upon Letters, &s;hould be able to prevail in matters &s;o Improbable in them&s;elves, and Scandalous to Us; for which we cannot but likewi&s;e ask reparation, not only for the vin|dication <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of our own Honour, but al&s;o thereby to &s;ettle the minds of our Subjects, who&s;e fears and jealou&s;ies would &s;oon vani&s;h, were they not fed and maintained by &s;uch fal&s;e and malicious Rumours as the&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR Our return to Our Parliament, We have given you a full An|&s;wer in Ours to your Declaration; and you ought to look on Us as not Gone, but Driven (we &s;ay not By you, yet) From you.

<P>THESE quick An&s;wers from the King gave them very much trouble, and made it evident to them, that he would be no more Swagger'd into conce&s;&s;ions, that he thought unrea&s;onable, or per&s;waded to them upon General promi&s;es, or an Implicit confidence in their Future mode&s;ty; but that he demanded reparation for the breach of his Priviledges, and &s;o fought with them with their own Weapons, troubled them much more; apprehending that, in a &s;hort time, the People might be per|&s;waded <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to believe, that the King was in the right, and had not been well dealt with: and tho' &s;ome few, who thought them&s;elves too far ingaged to retire, were glad of the &s;harpne&s;s of the&s;e Paper-Skirmi&s;hes, which they believed made the wound &s;till wider, and more incurable; yet the Major part, which had been induced to joyn with them out of Confidence that the King would yield, and that their boldne&s;s and importunity in Asking, would prevail with his Maje&s;ty to Con&s;ent, wi&s;hed them&s;elves fairly unintangled; and I have heard many of the fierce&s;t Concurrers, and who have ever &s;ince kept them company, at that time profe&s;s, <Q>&startq;&endq;that if any expedient might be found to reconcile the pre&s;ent difference <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> about the Militia, they would no more Adventure upon Demands of the like Nature:</Q> and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him&s;elf was &s;tartled, and con|fe&s;&s;ed to his Friends, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he de&s;ired a more moderate proceeding &s;hould be in Parliament; and that the King, who had Given &s;o much, &s;hould Receive &s;ome &s;atisfaction.</Q> But tho&s;e of the Court, who thought their faults to their Ma&s;ter mo&s;t unpardonable, could not endure that the younge&s;t Courtier, &s;hould be the elde&s;t Convert; and therefore, by repeating what the King and Queen had &s;aid of him Heretofore, and by fre&s;h Intelligence, which they procured from <HI>York,</HI> of what the King Then thought of him, they per&s;waded him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that his condition was too <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> de&s;perate to recede:</Q> and all men were per&s;waded, that this &s;teddy de|portment of the King proceeded from &s;ome new evil Coun&s;ellors, who would be a&s;&s;oon De&s;troyed, as Di&s;covered; and that Then they would &s;o carry them&s;elves, that the King &s;hould owe his Greatne&s;s, and his Glory (for they &s;till &s;aid, "he &s;hould excel all his Predece&s;&s;ors in both) to Their formed Coun&s;els and Activity, and not to the whi&s;pers of tho&s;e, who thought to do his bu&s;ine&s;s without them. And I am per|&s;waded that even then, and I was at that time no &s;tranger to the per&s;ons of mo&s;t that governed, and a diligent ob&s;erver of their carriage, they had rather a de&s;ign of making them&s;elves powerful with the King, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> great at Court, than of le&s;&s;ening the power of the One, or reforming the di&s;cipline of the Other: but, no doubt, there were &s;ome Few in the number that looked further; yet by pretending That, kept up the Mettal of writing, and inclined them for their Honour to new Decla|rations.</P>
<P>THE King found him&s;elf at &s;ome ea&s;e, and mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Quality of that great County, and of the Counties adjacent, re&s;orted to him, and many per&s;ons of condition from <HI>London,</HI> and tho&s;e parts, who had not the courage to attend upon him at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> &s;o that the Court appeared with &s;ome lu&s;tre. And now he begun to think of executing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;ome of tho&s;e re&s;olutions, which he had made with the Queen before her departure; One of which was, and to be fir&s;t done, the removing the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> from their Offices in the Court, the One
<PB N="373" REF="3910">
of Chamberlain, the Other of Groom of the Stole, which hath the re|putation and benefit of being fir&s;t Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber. In|deed no man could &s;peak in the ju&s;tification of either of them, yet no man thought them Equally culpable. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was a Per|&s;on meerly of the Kings, and his Fathers creation; rai&s;ed from the con|dition of a private Gentleman, a younger Brother of an extraction that lay under a great blemi&s;h, and without any fortune, to a great height by their meer favour, and bounty. And they had not only adorn'd him with Titles, Honours, and Offices, but inabled him to &s;upport tho&s;e in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the highe&s;t Lu&s;tre, and with the large&s;t Expence: and this King had drawn many inconveniences, and great di&s;advantages, upon him&s;elf and his &s;ervice, by his preferring him to &s;ome Tru&s;ts, which Others did not only Think them&s;elves, but Really were worthier of; but e&s;pecially by indulging him &s;o far in the rigorous execution of his Office of Chief Ju&s;tice in Eyre, in which he brought more prejudice upon the Court, and more di&s;content upon the King, from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Nobility and Gentry in <HI>England,</HI> than proceeded from any one Action, that had its ri&s;e from the King's will and plea&s;ure, tho' it was not without &s;ome Warrant from Law; but having not been practi&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> for &s;ome hundreds of years, was looked upon as a terrible Innovation and Exaction upon Per&s;ons, who knew not that they were in any fault; nor was any imputed to them, but the Original Sin of their Forefathers, even for which they were obliged to pay great penalties and ran&s;oms. That Such a Servant &s;hould &s;uffer his Zeal to le&s;&s;en and decay towards Such a Ma&s;ter, and that he &s;hould keep a Title to lodge in his Bed-Chamber, from who&s;e Court he had, upon the matter, withdrawn him|&s;elf, and adhered to, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e, who affronted and contemned his Maje&s;ty &s;o notoriou&s;ly, would admit of no manner of Interpo&s;ition and Excu&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> LESS was to be objected again&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who as he had been, all his life, without obligations from the Court, and believed he had undergone oppre&s;&s;ion there, &s;o he was, in all re&s;pects, the &s;ame man he had allways profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be, when the King put him into that Office; and in receiving of which, many men believed, that He rather gratify'd the King, than that his Maje&s;ty had obliged Him in conferring it; and it had been, no doubt, the chief rea&s;on of putting the Staff in his hand, becau&s;e in that Conjuncture no other man, who would in any degree have appeared worthy of it, had the courage to receive it. How|ever having taken the Charge upon him, he ought, no doubt, to have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> taken all his Ma&s;ters concernments more to heart, than he had done; and he can never be excu&s;ed for &s;taying in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when the King was with that Outrage driven from thence, and for choo&s;ing to behold the triumph of the Members return to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> rather than to at|tend his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on in &s;o great perplexity to <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> which had been his duty to have done, and for failing wherein no other excu&s;e can be made, but that, after he had taken &s;o full a re&s;olution to have waited upon his Maje&s;ty thither, that he had dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his travelling habit, he was diverted from it by the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who ougt to have accompanied him in the &s;ervice, and by his averment, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> "that if he went, he &s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; which it was not po&s;&s;ible &s;hould have ever been &s;o much as thought of.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, the Per&s;ons tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty and remaining at <HI>London,</HI> had no &s;ooner notice of it (which his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="374" REF="3920">
fent to them, that he might be advi&s;ed the be&s;t way of doing it) but they did all they could to di&s;&s;wade the pur&s;uing it. They did not think it a good conjuncture to make tho&s;e two per&s;ons de&s;perate; and they knew that they were not of the temper and inclinations of tho&s;e, who had too much credit with them, nor did de&s;ire to drive things to the ut|mo&s;t extremities, which could never better their conditions; and that they did both rather de&s;ire to find any Expedients, by which they might make a &s;afe and an honourable Retreat, than to Advance in the way they were ingaged in. But the Argument they chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on to the King, was, <Q>&startq;&endq;that being deprived of their Offices, they would be able <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to do more mi&s;chief, and ready to imbark them&s;elves with the mo&s;t de&s;perate per&s;ons,</Q> in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Attempts; which fell out ac|cordingly. And there is great rea&s;on to believe, that if that re&s;olution the King had taken, had not been too ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued at that time, many of the mi&s;chiefs, which afterwards fell out, would have been pre|vented; and, without doubt, if the Staff had remained &s;till in the hands of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> by which he was charged with the defence and &s;e|curity of the King's Per&s;on, he would never have been prevailed with to have taken upon him the Command of that Army, which was after|wards rai&s;ed again&s;t the King, and with which &s;o many battles were <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> fought. And there can be as little doubt in any man, who knew well the nature and temper of that time, that it had been very difficult, if not utterly impo&s;&s;ible, for the two Hou&s;es of Parliament to have rai&s;ed an Army Then, if the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had not con&s;ented to be General of that Army.</P>
<P>BuT the King was inexorable in the point; he was obliged by pro|mi&s;e to the Queen at parting, which he would not break; and her Ma|je&s;ty had contracted &s;o great an indignation again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who&s;e ingratitude indeed towards Her was very odious, that &s;he had &s;aid, "She would never live in the Court, if He kept his place. And &s;o the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> King &s;ent an Order to <HI>Littleton</HI> the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he &s;hould require the Staff and Key from the one, and the other, and receive them into his cu&s;tody.</Q> The Keeper trembled at the Office, and had not courage to undertake it. He went pre&s;ently to the Lord <HI>Falk|land,</HI> and de&s;ired him to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in making his excu&s;e to the King. He made many profe&s;&s;ions of his Duty to the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;who, he hoped, would not command him in an affair &s;o un&s;uitable to the Office he held under him: that no Keeper had been imployed in &s;uch a &s;ervice; that if he &s;hould execute the Order he had received, it would in the fir&s;t place be Voted a breach of Priviledge in him, being a Peer; and the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e would commit him to Pri&s;on, by which the King would receive the greate&s;t affront, tho' He &s;hould be ruin'd; whereas the thing it &s;elf might be done by a more proper Officer, without any incon|venience.</Q></P>
<P>HOW weak &s;oever the Rea&s;ons were, the Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;trong, and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> could not refu&s;e to convey his Letter to the King, which contained his An&s;wer in his own words, with all the imaginable pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Duty and Zeal for his Service. How ill &s;oever his Maje&s;ty was &s;atisfied, he &s;aw the bu&s;ine&s;s would not be done That way; and therefore he writ immediately a Letter, all in his own hand, to the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Lord <HI>Falkland;</HI> in which with &s;ome gracious expre&s;&s;ions of excu&s;e for putting that work upon Him, he commanded him <Q>&startq;&endq;to require the &s;ur|render of the En&s;igns of their Offices from tho&s;e two Earls.</Q> The Lord
<PB N="375" REF="3930">
<HI>Falkland</HI> was a little troubled in receiving the command; They were per&s;ons from whom he had allways received great civilities, and with whom he had much credit; and this har&s;h office might have been more naturally, and as Effectually performed by a Gentleman U&s;her, as the &s;ame Staff had been demanded before from the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> within le&s;s than a year. However, he would make no excu&s;e, being a very punctual and exact Per&s;on in the performances of his Duty; and &s;o went to both of them: and met them coming to the Hou&s;e, and imparted his Me&s;&s;age to them: They de&s;ired him very civilly, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would give <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> them leave to confer a little together, and they would, within half an hour,</Q> &s;end for him into the Hou&s;e of Commons; whither he went, and they within le&s;s time, &s;ent to him to meet them in S^r <HI>Thomas Cot|ton</HI>'s Garden (a place adjacent, where the Members of both Hou&s;es u&s;ed frequently to walk) and there with very few words, they delivered the Staff and the Key into his hands, who immediately carried them to his Lodging; and They went up to the Hou&s;e of Peers: and pre&s;ently both Hou&s;es took notice of it, and with Pa&s;&s;ion, and bitter Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the evil Coun&s;ellors, who had given his Maje&s;ty that Coun&s;el, they con|curred in a Vote, <Q>&startq;&endq;that who&s;oever pre&s;umed to accept of either of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Offices,</Q> &s;hould be reputed an Enemy to his Country; and then they proceeded with more impetuo&s;ity in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia, and all other matters which mo&s;t trenched upon the King's Authority.</P>
<P>WHILST they were &s;o eager in pur&s;uit of the Militia, and pretended the nece&s;&s;ity &s;o eminent, that they could not defer the di&s;po&s;ition thereof till it might be Formally, and Regularly &s;ettled by Bill, they had their Eye upon an other Militia, the Royal Navy; without recovering of which to their own power (tho' they were &s;atisfy'd by the pul&s;e of the People, that they would joyn with them, and be generally obedient to their commands) they had no mind to venture upon the execution of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> their Land Ordinance. And therefore, in the beginning of the Spring, when the Fleet for that year was provided, after they had excepted again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons to be Captains of Ships, as they thought not devoted to them (as is before mentioned) they &s;ent a formal Me&s;&s;age to the Lords, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> Lord Admiral, might be moved to con&s;titute the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> his Admiral of the Fleet for that years &s;ervice, being a Per&s;on of &s;uch Honour and experience, as they might &s;afely Confide in him; and that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> might be de&s;ired to undertake that &s;ervice.</Q> The Lords thought fit that the King's approbation might be fir&s;t de&s;ired, before it was recommended <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but the Commons thought that &s;uper|fluous, &s;ince the Officers of the Fleet were ab&s;olutely in the Earls di&s;|po&s;al; and therefore refu&s;ed to &s;end to the King, but of Them&s;elves &s;ent to both the one Earl, and the other; and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> being well plea&s;ed with the Tru&s;t, very frankly, without waiting the King's con&s;ent, declared "that he was ready to undertake the imployment. But this being &s;o publickly agitated, the King could not but take notice of it; and finding that the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould not be propo&s;ed to him, thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;ignify his plea&s;ure in it, that &s;o at lea&s;t the Lord Ad|miral might not pretend innocence, if ought &s;hould be done to his di&s;&s;er|vice; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and therefore, he appointed M^r Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to write to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that his Maje&s;ty expected that S^r <HI>John Pen|nington</HI> &s;hould Command that Fleet, as he had done two or three years before.</Q> This Letter being communicated to both Hou&s;es, and the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Me&s;&s;age from $$t$ Hou&s;es to the King, Mar. 28. 1642.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the Lords and Commons, in this pre&s;ent Parliament a&s;&s;em|bled, having found it nece&s;&s;ary to provide, and &s;et to Sea, a &s;trong and powerful Navy for the defence of this Kingdom again&s;t Forreign force, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and for the &s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's other Dominions, the Charge whereof was to be born by the Common-wealth: and taking notice of the indi&s;po&s;ition of the Lord Admiral, which di&s;abled him, at that time, for commanding the Fleet in his own Per&s;on, did thereupon re|commend unto his Lord&s;hip the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a Per&s;on of &s;uch Quality and Abilities, as in whom they might be&s;t Confide, to &s;upply his Lord&s;hips room for this imployment; and under&s;tanding that his Maje&s;ty hath Since &s;ignify'd his plea&s;ure concerning that Command for <HI>John Pennington,</HI> they &s;aid, they did hold it their Duty to repre|&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty the great danger, and mi&s;chief the Common-wealth <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> was like to &s;u&s;tain by &s;uch interruption; and therefore did humbly be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty, that the Noble Per&s;on, recommended by both Hou&s;es of Parliament for this &s;ervice, might be no longer detained from it,</Q> out of any particular re&s;pect to any other Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day that this Me&s;&s;age came to his Maje&s;ty, he di&s;patched<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's $word$</NOTE> an An&s;wer to the Lord Keeper; in which he told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he won|der'd both at the Form, and Matter of that inclo&s;ed paper he had &s;ent to him, in the Name of both Hou&s;es of Parliament: It being neither by the way of Petition, Declaration, or Letter; and for the Matter, he believed, it was the fir&s;t time, that the Hou&s;es of Parliament had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> taken upon them the Nomination, or Recommendation of the chief Sea-Commander; but it added to the wonder, that S^r <HI>John Penning|ton</HI> being allready appointed by him for that &s;ervice, upon the recom|mendation of his Admiral, and no fault &s;o much as alledged again&s;t him, another &s;hould be recommended to him. Therefore he &s;aid, his re&s;olution upon that point was, that he would not alter him, whom he had allready appointed to Command that years Fleet; who&s;e every ways &s;ufficiency was &s;o univer&s;ally known, the which he was confi|dent his Admiral, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, would make mo&s;t evi|dent; again&s;t who&s;e te&s;timony he &s;uppo&s;ed his Parliament would not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> except. And tho' there were yet None appointed, or the &s;aid S^r <HI>John,</HI> through &s;ome accident, not able to perform the &s;ervice; yet, he &s;aid, the men of that profe&s;&s;ion were &s;o well known to him, be&s;ides many other rea&s;ons, that (his Admiral excepted, becau&s;e of his place) re|commendations of that kind would not be acceptable to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS An&s;wer was no other than they expected, tho' they &s;eem'd troubled at it, and pretended that they had many things of Mi&s;demea|nour to object again&s;t S^r <HI>John Pennington,</HI> at lea&s;t &s;uch matters as would render him incapable of that Tru&s;t; the greate&s;t of which was, that he had convey'd the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> over Sea; tho' they well knew (as is be|fore <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> mentioned) that he had the King's Warrant and Command for that purpo&s;e; and therefore moved the Lords that he might be &s;ent for to be examined upon many particulars: and in the mean time, whil&s;t
<PB N="377" REF="3950">
they cau&s;ed him to attend their lei&s;ure to be examined, they proceeded in ha&s;tning the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to make him&s;elf ready for the Service, who made no &s;cruple of undertaking it; and the Earl of <HI>Northumber|land</HI> receiving the Order, and De&s;ire of both Hou&s;es <Q>&startq;&endq;to grant his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to him to be Admiral of that Fleet,</Q> thought him&s;elf &s;uffi|ciently excu&s;ed towards the King, and did it accordingly. The two Hou&s;es in the mean time, without any further thought of procuring the King's Con&s;ent, preparing rea&s;ons to &s;atisfy his Maje&s;ty for the Nece&s;&s;i|ty, or Conveniency of their proceeding.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> MANY men, e&s;pecially they, who at a di&s;tance ob&s;erved and di&s;cern'd the difficulties the King was like to encounter, wonder'd that upon &s;o apparent a breach of Tru&s;t, and act of Undutifulne&s;s, his Maje&s;ty did not at that time revoke the Lord Admiral's Commi&s;&s;ion, which was but during plea&s;ure; and &s;o put that &s;ure Guard of the Kingdom, his Navy, under &s;uch a Command as he might depend upon. But the truth is, it was not Then Coun&s;ellable; for (be&s;ides that it was ea&s;ier to Re&s;olve, "that it was fit to remove the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> than to find a man competent for the place) that way it might have been po&s;&s;ible to have prevented the going out of any Fleet to Sea, which would have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> confirmed the frantick Jealou&s;ies of bringing in Forreign Forces; but not have reduced it to his own obedience.</P>
<P>THEY had, by degrees, &s;o order'd the collection of Tonnage and Poun|dage, by pa&s;&s;ing Bills for &s;ix weeks and two months at a time, and putting tho&s;e, who &s;hould receive or pay tho&s;e Duties otherwi&s;e than they were granted by tho&s;e Bills into a Praemunire; and &s;o terrify'd the old Cu&s;tomers, that the King had no other means of &s;etting out his Fleet, than by the monies ari&s;ing by the Cu&s;toms, which they ab&s;olutely di&s;|po&s;ed of; and at this time had contracted with the Victualler, made the Ships ready, and hired many Merchants Ships to joyn in that Fleet for <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> the Guard of the Seas. And whil&s;t this matter of the Admiral was in &s;u&s;pence, they &s;uffered the former Bill of Tonnage and Poundage to ex|pire, and did not, till the very night before, pa&s;s a new Bill; which could not have the Royal A&s;&s;ent till many days after, the King being then at <HI>York.</HI> Yet the Hou&s;e of Commons, to &s;alve all danger of the Praemunire, on the 24^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> being the very day that the former Bill expired, &s;ent an Order to all the Collectors of the Cu&s;toms, many of which could not receive it in ten days after;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the new Bill being pa&s;&s;ed by both Hou&s;es for the continuance of tho&s;e payments untill the third day of <HI>May</HI> (which could not yet <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> receive the Royal A&s;&s;ent, in regard of the remotene&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on from the Parliament) which monies to be collected by that Bill were to be imployed in the nece&s;&s;ary guarding of the Seas, and de|fence of the Common-wealth: It was therefore order'd by the Com|mons in Parliament, that the &s;everal Officers belonging to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, both in the Port in <HI>London,</HI> and the out-Ports, &s;hould not permit any Merchant or other to Lade, or Unlade any Goods, or Merchandizes, before &s;uch Per&s;ons do make due entries thereof in the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e. And it was declared al&s;o by the &s;aid Commons, that &s;uch Officers, upon the re&s;pective entry made by any Merchant as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> afore&s;aid, &s;hould intimate to &s;uch Merchant, that it was the advice of the Commons, for the better ea&s;e of the &s;aid Merchants, and in re|gard the re&s;pective Duties would relate, and become due as from that day; that the &s;aid Merchants upon entry of their Goods, as u&s;ually
<PB N="378" REF="3960">
they did, when a Law was in force to that purpo&s;e, would depo&s;ite &s;o much money as the &s;everal Cu&s;toms would amount unto, in the hands of &s;uch Officers, to be by them accounted to his Maje&s;ty, as the re&s;pective Cu&s;toms due by the &s;aid Bill, when the &s;aid Bill &s;hould have the Royal A&s;&s;ent; or otherwi&s;e, his Maje&s;ty refu&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ing thereof, the &s;aid monies to be re&s;tored, upon demand, unto the &s;everal Mer|chants re&s;pectively.</Q></P>
<P>BY which Order, which was a more ab&s;olute Di&s;pen&s;ation for a Prae|munire, than ever any <HI>Non-ob&s;tante</HI> granted by the Crown, the Cu&s;toms were as frankly, and fully paid, as if an Act of Parliament had been <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> pa&s;&s;ed to that purpo&s;e; and a&s;&s;oon as the Commi&s;&s;ion could be &s;ent, and returned from <HI>York,</HI> the Act was pa&s;&s;ed. But no doubt they had a fur|ther de&s;ign in &s;uffering the Bill totally to expire, before they prepared a new One, than at that time was apprehended; and intended, under &s;uch a Popular nece&s;&s;ity, which &s;eem d to be occa&s;ioned by the King's ab&s;ence, to bring their own Orders in &s;uch a reputation, that in another nece&s;&s;ity which They &s;hould Declare, they might by the Precedent of this, which was the only Indemnity all tho&s;e Merchants who paid, and the Officers, who received Cu&s;toms, had for the pre&s;ervation of their E&s;tates, be currently and ab&s;olutely obeyed and &s;ubmitted to. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>BY this it appears the King could not at That time, with conveniency or &s;afety to his Affairs, di&s;place the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and he bel$eved, if his occa&s;ions &s;hould Hereafter require it, that the Time would be much more &s;ea&s;onable, when the Fleet was at Sea; and the Thing it &s;elf more practicable: which was a true conclu&s;ion. However, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much di&s;like again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s commanding that Fleet, that he was not willing that any Officers, whom he valued, &s;hould take imployment under him; which he had &s;hortly after cau&s;e to repent. For, by this means, the Vice-Admiralty, which was de&s;igned to Captain <HI>Cartwright,</HI> the Controller of the Navy, who hath &s;ince &s;uf|ficiently <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> te&s;tify'd how advantageou&s;ly to his Maje&s;ty he would have ma|naged that Charge, upon His refu&s;al (which was occa&s;ioned by intima|tion from his Maje&s;ty, as &s;hall be hereafter mentioned) was conferred upon <HI>Batten,</HI> an ob&s;cure fellow; and, tho' a good Sea-man, unknown to the Navy, till he was, two or three years before, for money, made Surveyor, who executed it ever &s;ince with great animo&s;ity again&s;t the King's Service, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>BEING, by this means, &s;ecure at Sea, they proceeded with more Vi|gour at Land; and, tho' they thought it not Yet &s;ea&s;onable to execute their Ordinance for the Militia with any Form and Pomp, they di|rected, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Underhand, their Agents and Emi&s;&s;aries, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the People, of Them&s;elves, &s;hould choo&s;e Captains and Officers, and Train under the name of Voluntiers;</Q> which begun to be practiced in many places of the Kingdom, but only in tho&s;e Corporations, and by tho&s;e Inferiour people, who were notorious for Faction, and Schi&s;m in Religion. The King's Declarations, which were now carefully publi&s;hed, gave them &s;ome trouble, and made great impre&s;&s;ion, in Sober men, who were moved with the Rea&s;on, and in Rich men, who were &s;tartled at the Commands in them. But that Clau&s;e in the King's An&s;wer to their De|claration, pre&s;ented to him at <HI>New-Market,</HI> in which he told them, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <Q>&startq;&endq;that if they had not been informed of the &s;editious words u&s;ed in, an$ the circum&s;tances of the Tumults, and would appoint &s;ome way for the examination of them, that he would require &s;ome of his learned
<PB N="379" REF="3970">
Coun&s;el to attend with &s;uch evidence as might &s;atisfy them,</Q> troubled them much more. For if there were &s;till &s;o much courage left in the King's Coun&s;el, that they dur&s;t appear to inform again&s;t any of tho&s;e proceedings, which They favoured, they &s;hould find men grow more affraid of the Law than of Them; which would de&s;troy all their de&s;igns. Therefore they re&s;olved to proceed with all expedition, and &s;everely again&s;t the Atturney General for his Tre&s;pa&s;s and Pre&s;umption upon their Priviledges, in the Accu&s;ation of the five Members, and the Lord <HI>$imbolton:</HI> of the circum&s;tances of which Proceeding, and Judgment <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> thereupon, being as extraordinary, and as di&s;tant from the Rules of Ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t of Practice, as any thing that then happen'd, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;et down two or three particulars.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after they had Impeached him (which is mentioned be|fore) and the King had found it nece&s;&s;ary to give over any pro&s;ecution again&s;t the Others, his Maje&s;ty being de&s;irous now he had freed Them, that they &s;hould free His Atturney, writ a Letter from <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> when he was in his way to <HI>York,</HI> to the Lord Keeper; in which he told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Articles, which had been preferred again&s;t the Members, were, by Him&s;elf, delivered to his Atturney General engro&s;&s;ed in paper; and that he had then commanded him to accu&s;e tho&s;e Per&s;ons, upon tho&s;e Articles of High-Trea&s;on, and other Mi&s;demeanours; and, in His Name, to de&s;ire a Committee of Lords might be appointed to take the examination of &s;uch Witne&s;&s;es as &s;hould be produced, as formerly had been done in ca&s;es of like nature, according to the Ju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e. And his Maje&s;ty did further declare, that his &s;aid Atturney did not advi&s;e or contrive the &s;aid Articles, nor had any thing to do with, or in advi&s;ing, any breach of Priviledge that followed after. And for what he did in obedience to His Commands, he conceived he was bound by Oath, and the duty of his Place, and by the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> by his Maje&s;ty, &s;o to do: and that if he had refu&s;ed to obey his Ma|je&s;ty therein, his Maje&s;ty would have que&s;tioned him for breach of Oath, Duty, and Tru&s;t; but now having declared that he found cau&s;e wholely to de&s;i&s;t from proceeding again&s;t the Per&s;ons accu&s;ed, he had commanded him to proceed no further therein, nor to produce, nor di&s;cover any Proof concerning the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH this Te&s;timony of his Maje&s;ty's clearly ab&s;olved him from the Guilt, with which he was charged, yet it rather ha&s;ten'd the Trial, and &s;harpen'd the edge, that was before keen enough again&s;t him; and the day of Trial being come, when the Members of the Commons, who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> were appointed for the Pro&s;ecution, found that Coun&s;el was ready (which had been a&s;&s;igned by the Lords) for the defence of the Atturney Gene|ral, they profe&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would admit no Coun&s;el; that it was be|low the dignity of the Hou&s;e of Commons to plead again&s;t fee'd Coun|&s;el; that whoever pre&s;umed to be of Coun&s;el with a Per&s;on accu&s;ed by the Commons of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be taught better to know his duty, and &s;hould have cau&s;e to repent it.</Q> The Lords &s;eem'd much moved with this reproach, that their Acts of Judicature &s;hould be que&s;tioned, and the Coun&s;el, which had been ju&s;tly, and regularly a&s;&s;ign'd by them, &s;hould be threaten'd for &s;ubmitting to Their Order. But that which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> troubled them mo&s;t, was, that the Coun&s;el, which was a&s;&s;ign'd by them, upon this reprehen&s;ion, and threat of the Commons, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to meddle further in the bu&s;ine&s;s, or to make any Defence for the Attur|ney. Hereupon, they put off the Trial, and commit to the Tower of
<PB N="380" REF="3980">
<HI>London</HI> S^r <HI>Thomas Bedingfield,</HI> and S^r <HI>Thomas Gardner,</HI> for their con|tempt in refu&s;ing to be of Coun&s;el with the Atturney upon Their A&s;&s;ign|ment: &s;tanders by looking upon the ju&s;tice of Parliament with le&s;s re|verence, to &s;ee the Subject, between the contradictory, and oppo&s;ite Commands of both Hou&s;es (the di&s;plea&s;ure of either being in&s;upporta|ble) puni&s;hed and impri&s;oned for doing, by One, what he was &s;treightly inhibited from doing by the Other.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this difference gave only re&s;pite for &s;ome days to the At|turney, who was quickly again called before his Judges. To what was pa&s;&s;ionately and unrea&s;onably objected again&s;t him, <Q>&startq;&endq;of breach of Pri|viledge <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and Scandal, he confidently alledg'd "the Duty of his place; that his Ma&s;ter's Command was Warrant for what he had done; and that he had been ju&s;tly puni&s;hable if he had refu&s;ed to do it, when Com|manded; that there had never been a Pretence of Priviledge in Ca&s;e of Trea&s;on, the contrary whereof was not only under&s;tood by the Law, but had been by Them&s;elves confe&s;&s;ed, in a Petition delivered by them in the beginning of this King's Reign, upon the impri&s;onment of the Earl of <HI>Arundel;</HI> in which it was acknowledged, that the Priviledges of Parliament extended not to Trea&s;on, Felony, or refu&s;al to find Sure|ties for the Peace; that he had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the executing the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Duty of his place would have been imputed to him for any Tre&s;pa&s;s, &s;ince the very &s;ame thing he had now done, and of which he &s;tood ac|cu&s;ed, was done, in the fir&s;t year of this King's Reign, by S^r <HI>Robert Heath,</HI> the then Atturney General; who exhibited Articles of High-Trea&s;on before their Lord&s;hips, again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was not then under&s;tood to be any breach of Priviledge; and therefore, having &s;o late a Precedent, mo&s;t of their Lord&s;hips being then Judges, he hoped he &s;hould be held excu&s;able for not being able to di&s;cern that to be a crime, which they had yet never declared to be &s;o. The un|deniable rea&s;ons of his Defence (again&s;t which nothing was replied, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> but the inconvenience and mi&s;chief, which would attend a Parliament, if the Members might be accu&s;ed of High-Trea&s;on without Their con|&s;ent)</Q> prevailed &s;o far with the Major part of the Hou&s;e of Peers, tho' the Pro&s;ecution was carried on with all imaginable &s;harpne&s;s, and vehe|mence by the Hou&s;e of Commons, and entertained by tho&s;e Peers, who were of that Party, as a matter of va&s;t concernment to all their hopes, that the Que&s;tions being put, whether he &s;hould be deprived of his place of Atturney? whether he &s;hould be Fined to the King? whether he &s;hould pay Damages to the per&s;ons accu&s;ed? and whether he &s;hould be committed to the Tower? which were the &s;everal parts of the Sentence, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> which many of the Lords had pre&s;&s;ed he &s;hould undergo, the Negative prevailed in every one of the Particulars; &s;o that the Atturney was un|der&s;tood by all men, who under&s;tood the Rules and Practice of Parlia|ment, to be ab&s;olutely ab&s;olved from that Charge and Impeachment, by the Judgment of the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Commons expre&s;&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible re&s;entment, and de|clared "that they would not re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with the Judgment; and &s;ome Lords, even of tho&s;e who had acquitted him, were very de&s;irous to find out an Expedient, whereby the Hou&s;e of Commons might be com|pounded with; and it was believed, that the Atturney him&s;elf was much <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;haken with the torrent of Malice and Prejudice, which the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eem'd now to threaten him with; conceiving, <Q>&startq;&endq;that He and his Office now triumphed over the whole Body, and not over &s;ix

<P>UPON the Petition mentioned before, that was framed in <HI>London</HI> again&s;t their &s;etling the Militia, they committed one <HI>George Binion,</HI> a Citizen of great reputation for Wealth and Wi&s;dom, and who was in|deed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> a very &s;ober man. After he had lain &s;ome time in Pri&s;on, the Lords, according to Law, bailed him; but the Commons cau&s;ed him the next day to be recommitted, and preferr'd an Impeachment again&s;t him, for no other crime but "advi&s;ing and contriving that Petition. The Gen|tleman defended him&s;elf, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was allways held, and &s;o publickly declared this Parliament, to be Lawful, in a mode&s;t way, to Petition for the removal, or prevention of any grievance: that ob&s;erving very many Petitions to be delivered, and received, for the &s;etling the Mi|litia, in an other way than was then agreeable to the Law, or had been practiced, and conceiving that the &s;ame would prove very preju|dicial <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to the City of <HI>London,</HI> of which he was a Member, he had joyn'd with many other Citizens, of known ability and integrity, in a Petition again&s;t &s;o great an inconvenience; which, he pre&s;umed, was lawful for him to do.</Q> How rea&s;onable &s;oever this Defence was, the Hou&s;e of Peers adjudged him <Q>&startq;&endq;to be Disfranchi&s;ed, and incapable of any Office in the City; to be committed to the Common Goal of <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> (for his reputation was &s;o great in <HI>London,</HI> that they would not tru&s;t him in a City Pri&s;on)</Q> and Fined him three thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, at the General A&s;&s;izes in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and principal Gentlemen of that County, prepared a Petition <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> to be pre&s;ented to the two Hou&s;es, with a de&s;ire, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Militia might not be otherwi&s;e exerci&s;ed in that County, than the known Law permitted: and that the Book of Common Prayer, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law,</Q> might be ob&s;erved. This Petition was communicated by many
<PB N="382" REF="4000">
to their friends, and Copies thereof sent abroad, before the Sub&s;cription was ready; whereupon the Hou&s;e of Peers took notice of it, as tending to &s;ome Commotion in <HI>Kent;</HI> and, in the Debate, the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> taking notice, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he had Seen a Copy of it, and had had &s;ome con|ference about it with Judge <HI>Mallet,</HI></Q> who was then Judge of A&s;&s;ize in <HI>Kent,</HI> and newly return'd out of his Circuit, both the Earl and Judge, for having but Seen the Petition, were pre&s;ently committed to the Tower: and a Declaration publi&s;hed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that none &s;hould pre&s;ume to de|liver that,</Q> or the like Petition to either Hou&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding which, &s;ome Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> with a great number of the Sub&s;tan|tial <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Inhabitants of that County, came to the City; which upon the Alarum, was put in Arms; &s;trong Guards placed at <HI>London&punc;Bridge,</HI> where the Petitioners were di&s;armed, and only &s;ome few &s;uffered to pa&s;s with their Petition to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> the re&s;t forced to return to their Country. And, upon the delivery thereof to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons (tho' the &s;ame was very mode&s;t, and in a more dutiful Dialect than mo&s;t Petitions delivered to them) the bringers of the Petition were &s;harply reprehended; two or three of them committed to &s;everal Pri|&s;ons; the Principal Gentlemen of the Country, who had &s;ub&s;cribed and advi&s;ed it&punc; &s;ent for as Delinquents; Charges, and Articles of Impeach|ment, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> drawn up again&s;t them; and a Declaration publi&s;hed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that who|&s;oever &s;hould henceforth advi&s;e, or contrive the like Petitions &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t,</Q> as Enemies to the Common-wealth. So unlike, and different were their tempers, and reception of tho&s;e mode&s;t Ad|dre&s;&s;es, which were for duty and obedience to the Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed; and tho&s;e which pre&s;&s;ed, and brought on Alteration and Innovation. But that inju&s;tice gave great life, and incouragement to their own Pro&s;elytes; and taught Others to know that their being Innocent would not be long Ea&s;y or Safe: and this kind of Ju&s;tice extended it &s;elf in the &s;ame mea|&s;ure to their own Members, who oppo&s;ed their Irregular determina|tions; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> who, be&s;ides the agony and vexation of having the mo&s;t plain rea&s;on, and confe&s;&s;ed Law, rejected, and overruled with contempt and noi&s;e, were liable to all the Per&s;onal reproaches and di&s;countenance, that the Pride and Petulancy of the other Party, could lay upon them; and were &s;ometimes impri&s;oned and di&s;graced, for Freely &s;peaking their Opinions, and Con&s;cience in Debate.</P>
<P>ALL &s;orts of men being thus terrify'd, the Commons remember'd, that a great Magazine of the King's Ammunition lay &s;till at <HI>Hull;</HI> and tho' that Town was in the cu&s;tody of a Confident of their own, yet they were not willing to venture &s;o great a trea&s;ure &s;o near the King, who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> continued at <HI>York,</HI> with a great re&s;ort of Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality from all parts; and therefore they re&s;olved, under pretence of &s;upply|ing <HI>Ireland,</HI> to remove it &s;peedily from thence; and moved the Lords, to joyn with them in an Order to that purpo&s;e. The Lords, who pro|ceeded with le&s;s Fury, and more Formality, de&s;ired <Q>&startq;&endq;that it might be done with the King's con&s;ent.</Q> After a long Debate, the one thinking they merited much by that Civility, the other contented to gratify tho&s;e in the Ceremony, who, they knew, would in the end concur with them, a Petition was agreed upon to be &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty; in which, that he might the &s;ooner yield to them in this matter, they re&s;olved to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> remember him of that, which, they thought, would reflect on him with the People, and to <Q>&startq;&endq;move him to take off the Reprieve from the &s;ix Prie&s;ts, which is before mentioned.</Q> And &s;o they &s;ent their Petition

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND yet of this, in point of Right, or Priviledge, for &s;ure We are not without Priviledge too, We have not all this while complained: and being confident that the place, what&s;oever di&s;cour&s;e there is of Publick or Private in&s;tructions to the contrary, &s;hall be &s;peedily given up&punc; if We &s;hall require it, We &s;hall be contented to di&s;po&s;e our Mu|nition <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> there, as We have done in other places, for the publick ea&s;e and benefit, as, upon particular advice, We &s;hall find convenient; tho' we cannot think it fit, or con&s;ent, that the whole Magazine be re|moved together.

of the &s;trength, and union of the two Nations of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> did not much hinder, and di&s;courage the execution of any &s;uch de&s;ign.

<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;&endq;HIS Royal Per&s;on would be &s;ubject, not only to the ca&s;ualty of War, but to &s;ecret Practices and Con&s;piracies; e&s;pecially his Maje&s;ty continuing his profe&s;&s;ion to maintain the Prote&s;tant Religion in that Kingdom, which the Papi&s;ts were generally bound by their vow to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> extirpate.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>&startq;&endq;IT would exceedingly encourage the Rebels; who did generally profe&s;s and declare, that his Maje&s;ty did favour and allow their pro|ceedings, and that this In&s;urrection was undertaken by the Warrant of his Commi&s;&s;ion; and it would make good their expectation of great advantage, by his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence at that time, of &s;o much di&s;traction in his Kingdom, whereby they might hope the two Hou&s;es of Par|liament would be di&s;abled to &s;upply the War there, e&s;pecially there appearing le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity of his Maje&s;ty's Journey at that time, by rea|&s;on of the manifold &s;ucce&s;&s;es,</Q> which God had given again&s;t them. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>&startq;&endq;IT would much hinder, and impair the means whereby the War was to be &s;upported, and increa&s;e the Charge of it, and in both the&s;e re&s;pects make it more in&s;upportable to the Subject; and this, they &s;aid, they could confidently affirm; becau&s;e many of the Adven|turers, who had allready &s;ub&s;cribed, did, upon the knowledge of his Maje&s;ty&punc;s intention, declare their re&s;olution not to pay in their money; and others, very willing to have &s;ub&s;cribed, do Now profe&s;s the con|trary.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>&startq;&endq;HIS Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily very much interrupt the proceedings of Parliament; and deprive his Subjects of the benefit of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> tho&s;e further Acts of Grace and Ju&s;tice, which they &s;hould humbly expect from his Maje&s;ty for the e&s;tabli&s;hing a perfect Union, and mu|tual Confidence between his Maje&s;ty and his People, and procuring, and confirming the pro&s;perity,</Q> and happine&s;s of both.</P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>&startq;&endq;IT would exceedingly increa&s;e the Fears and Jealou&s;ies of his People; and render their Doubts more probable, of &s;ome Force in|tended, by &s;ome evil Coun&s;els near his Maje&s;ty, in oppo&s;ition of the Parliament,</Q> and favour of the Malignant Party of this Kingdom.</P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>&startq;&endq;IT would bereave his Parliament of that advantage, whereby they were induced to undertake that War, upon his Maje&s;ty's promi&s;e <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> that it &s;hould be managed by Their advice; which could not be done, if his Maje&s;ty&punc; contrary to their Coun&s;els, &s;hould undertake to order, and govern it in his own Per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;UPON which, and divers other rea&s;ons, they &s;aid, they had Re|&s;olved, by the full and concurrent Agreement of both Hou&s;es, that they could not, with di&s;charge of their duty, con&s;ent to any Levies or rai&s;ing of Soldiers to be made by his Maje&s;ty, for that his intended expedition into <HI>Ireland;</HI> or to the payment of any Army, or Soldiers there, but &s;uch as &s;hould be imployed, and governed according to their advice, and direction: and that, if &s;uch Levies &s;hould be made by any <MILESTONE N="$0" UNIT="line"> Commi&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's, not agreed to by both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, they &s;hould be forced to interpret the &s;ame to be rai&s;ed to the Terrour of his People, and Di&s;turbance of the Publick Peace; and

<P>TO this Petition (the Matter whereof finding a general concurrence, there was the le&s;s debate, and contradiction upon the Manner of expre&s;|&s;ion) being &s;ent to the King to <HI>York;</HI> and, in the mean time, all prepa|rations being &s;u&s;pended for the nece&s;&s;ary relief for <HI>Ireland,</HI> in&s;omuch as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> with the Votes (which were pre&s;ently printed) again&s;t the King's Jour|ney&punc; there was likewi&s;e an Order printed to di&s;courage the Adventurers from bringing in their Money; the which, tho' it had no approbation from either Hou&s;e, and &s;eem'd to be angrily interpreted by them, and the Printer was order'd to be found out and puni&s;hed, yet did wholely &s;top that Service; and by the no&punc;enquiry, or puni&s;hment of that bold|ne&s;s, appear'd to be done by de&s;ign) his Maje&s;ty &s;peedily returned this An&s;wer.</P>

For the re&s;olving of &s;o great a bu&s;ine&s;s without the Advice of his Parliament, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t remember them, how often, by his Me&s;&s;age, he made the &s;ame offer, if They &s;hould advi&s;e him thereunto; to which they never gave him the lea&s;t An&s;wer; but, in their late Declaration, told him, that they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> were not to be &s;atisfy'd with Words: &s;o that he had rea&s;on to conceive, they rather avoided, out of regard to his Per&s;on, to give him Coun&s;el to run that hazard, than that they di&s;approved the inclination. And, he asked them, what greater comfort, or &s;ecurity the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> could receive, than by &s;eeing a Prote&s;tant King venture, and engage his Per&s;on for the Defence of That Religion, and the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Popery? to which he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, in that Me&s;&s;age, never to grant a Toleration, upon what pretence &s;oever, or any abo|lition of any of the Laws There in force again&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ours of it. And, he &s;aid, when he con&s;idered the great calamities, and unheard of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> cruelties, his poor Prote&s;tant Subjects in that Kingdom had undergone for the &s;pace of near, or full &s;ix Months; the growth and increa&s;e of the &s;trength of tho&s;e barbarous Rebels; and the evident probability of forreign &s;upplies, if they were not &s;peedily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; the very &s;low &s;uccours hitherto &s;ent them from hence: that the Officers of &s;everal Regiments, who had long time been allowed entertainment from them for that Service, had not rai&s;ed any &s;upply, or &s;uccour for that King|dom; that many Troops of Hor&s;e had long lain near <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> un|tran&s;ported; that the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> on whom he relied principally for the conduct, and managing of Affairs there, was &s;till in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> this Kingdom, notwith&s;tanding his Maje&s;ty's earne&s;tne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed, that he &s;hould repair to his Command: and when he con&s;ider'd the many and great &s;candals rai&s;ed upon him&s;elf by report of the Rebels, and not &s;ufficiently di&s;countenanced Here, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many pro|fe&s;&s;ions of his Maje&s;ty; and had &s;een a Book, lately printed by the Order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, entituled a Remon&s;trance of divers remarkable pa&s;&s;ages concerning the Church and Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> wherein &s;ome Examinations were &s;et down (how improbable or im|po&s;&s;ible &s;oever) which might make an impre&s;&s;ion in the minds of many of his weak Subjects: And la&s;tly, when he had duely weighed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the di&s;honour that would perpetually lie upon this Kingdom, if full and &s;peedy relief were not di&s;patched thither; his Maje&s;ty could not think of a better way to di&s;charge his Duty to Allmighty God, for the defence of the true Prote&s;tant Religion, or to manife&s;t his Affection to his three Kingdoms, for their pre&s;ervation, than by engaging his Per|&s;on in that expedition, as many of his Royal Progenitors had done, even in Forreign Parts, upon cau&s;es of Le&s;s importance and piety, with great Honour to them&s;elves, and Advantage to this Kingdom. And therefore,</Q> he expected at lea&s;t Thanks for &s;uch his inclination.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR the danger to his Per&s;on, he &s;aid, he conceived it nece&s;&s;ary, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and worthy of a King, to adventure his Life to pre&s;erve his Kingdoms; neither could it be imagined that he would &s;it &s;till, and &s;uffer his King|doms to be lo&s;t, and his good Prote&s;tant Subjects to be Ma&s;&s;acre'd,

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR any encouragement to the Rebels, becau&s;e of the Reports they rai&s;ed, he &s;aid, he could not conceive, that the Rebels were capable of a greater terrour, than by the Pre&s;ence of their Lawful King, in the head of an Army, to cha&s;ti&s;e them. Be&s;ides, it would be an un&s;peakable advantage to them, if any report of Theirs could hinder him from do|ing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> any thing, which were fit for him to do, if &s;uch report were not rai&s;ed: that would quickly teach them, in this Jealous age, to pre|vent, by &s;uch reports, any other Per&s;ons coming again&s;t them, whom they had no mind &s;hould be imploy'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE told them, that he marvelled, that the Adventurers, who&s;e advantage was a principal motive (next the rea&s;ons before mentioned) to him, &s;hould &s;o much mi&s;take his purpo&s;e; who&s;e intere&s;t he con|ceived mu&s;t be much improved by the expedition he hoped, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, to u&s;e in that Service; that being the mo&s;t probable way for the &s;peedy Conque&s;t of the Rebels, their Lands were &s;ufficiently &s;e|cured <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> by Act of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE told them, he thought him&s;elf not kindly u&s;ed, that the addi|tion of &s;o few Men to their Levies (for a Guard to his Per&s;on in <HI>Ire|land)</HI> &s;hould be thought fit for their refu&s;al; and much more, that having u&s;ed &s;o many cautions in that Me&s;&s;age, both in the &s;malne&s;s of the number; in his having rai&s;ed none, untill their An&s;wer; in their being to be rai&s;ed only near the place of &s;hipping; in their being There to be armed, and that not till they were ready to be &s;hipp'd; in the provi&s;ion, by the Oaths, that none of them &s;hould be Papi&s;ts (all which were &s;ufficient to de&s;troy all grounds of Jealou&s;y of any Force intended <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> by them in oppo&s;ition to the Parliament, or favour to any Malignant Party) any Su&s;picion &s;hould,</Q> notwith&s;tanding, be grounded upon it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;NEITHER, he &s;aid, could it be under&s;tood, that when he recom|mended the managing of that War to Them, he intended to exclude Him&s;elf, or not to be concerned in their Coun&s;els, that if he found any Expedient (which, in his con&s;cience and under&s;tanding, he thought nece&s;&s;ary for that great work) he might not put it in practice. He told them, he looked upon them as his great Council, who&s;e advice he allways had, and would, with great regard and deliberation, weigh and con&s;ider: but he looked upon him&s;elf as neither deprived of his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Under&s;tanding, or deve&s;ted of any Right he had, if there were no Par|liament &s;itting. He &s;aid, he called them together, by his own Writ and Authority (without which they could not have met) to give him faithful Coun&s;el about his Great Affairs; but he re&s;igned not up his own Intere&s;t, and Freedom; he never &s;ubjected him&s;elf to Their ab|&s;olute Determination; He had allways weighed their Coun&s;els, as pro|ceeding from a Body intru&s;ted by him; and when he had di&s;&s;ented from them, he had returned them the rea&s;ons, which had prevailed with his con&s;cience and under&s;tanding, with that Candour, which a Prince &s;hould u&s;e towards his Subjects; and that Affection, which a Fa|ther <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> could expre&s;s to his Children. What application had been u&s;ed to rectify his Under&s;tanding by Rea&s;ons, or what Motives had been given to per&s;wade his Affections, he would leave all the world to judge. And then, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t tell them, how&s;oever a Major part
<PB N="392" REF="4100">
might bind Them in matter of opinion, he held Him&s;elf (and he was &s;ure the Law and Con&s;titution of the Kingdom had allways held the &s;ame) as free to di&s;&s;ent, till his Rea&s;on was convinced, for the Gene|ral Good,</Q> as if they had delivered No opinion.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR his Journey it &s;elf, he told them the circum&s;tances of their Petition were &s;uch, as he knew not well what An&s;wer to return, or whether he were be&s;t to give Any; that part which pretended to carry Rea&s;on with it, did no way &s;atisfy him; the Other, which was rather Reprehen&s;ion and Menace, than Advice, could not &s;tagger him. His An&s;wer therefore was, that he &s;hould be very glad to find the work of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;o ea&s;y, as they &s;eem'd to think it; which did not &s;o appear by any thing known to him, when he &s;ent his Me&s;&s;age: and tho' he would never refu&s;e, or be unwilling, to venture his Per&s;on, for the Good and Safety of his People, he was not &s;o weary of his life, as to hazard it Impertinently; and therefore, &s;ince they &s;eem'd to have re|ceived Adverti&s;ements of &s;ome late, and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es in that King|dom, he would &s;tay &s;ome time to &s;ee the event of tho&s;e, and not pur|&s;ue his re&s;olution till he had given them a Second notice: but, if he found the mi&s;erable condition of his poor Subjects of that Kingdom were not &s;peedily relieved, he would, with God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, vi&s;it them <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> with &s;uch Succours, as his Particular credit and intere&s;t could &s;upply him with, if They refu&s;ed to Joyn with him. And he doubted not but the Levies he &s;hould make (in which he would ob&s;erve punctually the former, and all other cautions, as might be&s;t prevent all Fears and Jealou&s;ies; and to u&s;e no Power but what was Legal) would be &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of his Subjects, as no per&s;on would dare pre|&s;ume to re&s;i&s;t his Commands; and if they &s;hould, at their Peril be it. In the mean time, he hoped his forwardne&s;s, &s;o remarkable to that Service, &s;hould be notorious to all the world; and that all &s;candals, laid on him in that bu&s;ine&s;s,</Q> &s;hould be clearly wiped away. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE told them&punc; he had been &s;o careful that his Journey into <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould not interrupt the proceedings of Parliament, nor deprive his Subjects of any Acts of Ju&s;tice, or further Acts of Grace for the real benefit of his People, that he had made a free offer of leaving &s;uch power behind&punc; as &s;hould not only be nece&s;&s;ary for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom, but fully provide for the happy progre&s;s of the Par|liament: and therefore he could not but wonder, &s;ince &s;uch power had been allways left here, by Commi&s;&s;ion, for the Government of this Kingdom, when his Progenitors had been out of the &s;ame, during the &s;itting of Parliaments; and &s;ince Them&s;elves de&s;ired that &s;uch a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> power might be left here by his Maje&s;ty, at his la&s;t going into <HI>Scotland;</HI> what Law of the Land they had now found to di&s;pence with them from &s;ubmitting to &s;uch Authority, legally derived from him, in his ab&s;ence; and to enable them to govern the Kingdom by their Own meer Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR his return to <HI>London,</HI> he &s;aid, he had given them &s;o full An|&s;wers in his late Declaration, and An&s;wers that he knew not what to add to, if they would not provide for his &s;ecurity with them, nor agree to remove to another place, where there might not be the &s;ame dan|ger to his Maje&s;ty. He told them, he expected, that (&s;ince he had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> been &s;o particular in the cau&s;es and grounds of his Fears&punc; they &s;hould have &s;ent him word, that they had publi&s;hed &s;uch Declarations again&s;t future Tumults and unlawful A&s;&s;emblies, and taken &s;uch Cour&s;es for
<PB N="393" REF="4110">
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;editious Pamphlets and Sermons, that his Fears of that kind might be laid a&s;ide,</Q> before they &s;hould pre&s;s his return.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;TO conclude, he told them, he could wi&s;h, that they would, with the &s;ame &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity, weigh and examin their Me&s;&s;ages, and Expre&s;&s;ions To him, as they did tho&s;e they received From him. For he was very confident, that if they examined his Rights and Privi|ledges, by what His Predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed; and their own Ad|dre&s;&s;es, by the u&s;ual cour&s;es ob&s;erved by Their Ance&s;tors; they would find many expre&s;&s;ions in that Petition, warranted only by their own <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Authority; which indeed he forbore to take notice of, or to give An|&s;wer to, le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted, in a ju&s;t indignation, to expre&s;s a greater pa&s;&s;ion, than he was Yet willing to put on. God in his good time, he hoped, would &s;o inform the hearts of all his Subjects, that he &s;hould recover from the mi&s;chief, and danger of that di&s;temper; on who&s;e good plea&s;ure, he &s;aid, he would wait with all patience, and humility.</Q></P>
<P>FROM this time the purpo&s;e was never re&s;umed of his Maje&s;ty's per|&s;onal expedition into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;o They were freed from That ap|prehen&s;ion. The truth is, that Coun&s;el for his Maje&s;ty's Journey into <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> <HI>Ireland</HI> was very &s;uddainly taken, and communicated to very few, with|out con&s;ideration of the objections, that would naturally ari&s;e again&s;t it; and was rather re&s;olved as a probable Stratagem, to compo&s;e the two Hou&s;es to a better temper and &s;obriety, upon the Apprehen&s;ion of the King's ab&s;ence from them, and the inconveniencies that might thence en&s;ue, than &s;ufficiently con&s;ider'd and dige&s;ted for Execution. For none were more violent again&s;t it than they who &s;erved the King mo&s;t faith|fully in the Hou&s;es; who, in the King's ab&s;ence, and after &s;uch a Grant of the Militia, as was then offer'd, looked upon them&s;elves as &s;acrificed to the pride and fury of tho&s;e, who&s;e inclinations, and temper had be|got <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> the Confu&s;ions they complained of. But if it had been &s;o duely weighed and con&s;ulted, and Men &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that it might have been Executed, and the King had taken a fit Council, and Retinue about him, it would, at that time, have been no hard matter &s;peedily to have reduced <HI>Ireland;</HI> and by the reputation, and authority of That, the other two Kingdoms might have been contained within their proper bounds. But, as it fell out, the Overture proved Di&s;advantageous to the King, and gave the other Party New cau&s;e of Triumph, that they had plainly Threaten'd him out of what He pretended to have firmly re&s;olved to do; which di&s;advantage was improved by the Other Propo|&s;ition, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> that attended it, concerning the Militia. For the Bill, &s;ent by the King upon that Argument, brought the bu&s;ine&s;s again into Debate; and, tho&punc; nothing was concluded upon it, the King was a loo&s;er by the Propo&s;ition, tho' not &s;o much as he fear'd he &s;hould have been, when he &s;aw his Journey into <HI>Ireland</HI> de&s;perate; upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of which, he had only made that tender.</P>
<P>THE Bill &s;ent by the King, and preferred to the Hou&s;e of Peers, by the Atturney General, granted the Militia, for one year, to the per&s;ons fir&s;t nominated by the Hou&s;es in their Ordinances to his Maje&s;ty; and made tho&s;e per&s;ons, in the Execution of that Tru&s;t, &s;ubject to the Au|thority <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of his Maje&s;ty, and the two Hou&s;es Jointly, whil&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty was within the Kingdom; and, in his ab&s;ence, of the two Hou&s;es Only. What alterations, and amendments they made in it before they returned it again for the Royal A&s;&s;ent, will be&s;t appear by the King's
<PB N="394" REF="4120">
An&s;wer, which he &s;ent to them at the time of his refu&s;al to pa&s;s it; which was,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT he had, with great deliberation and patience, weighed and con&s;idered (as it concerned him much to weigh the con&s;equences of every Law before he pa&s;&s;ed it) their Bill lately &s;ent to him for the &s;etling the Militia; and tho&punc; it had not been u&s;ual to give any rea&s;on for the refu&s;al to pa&s;s any Bill, it being ab&s;olutely in his power to pa&s;s, or not to pa&s;s any Act &s;ent to him, if he conceived it prejudicial to him|helf, or inconvenient to his Subjects, for whom he was tru&s;ted, and mu&s;t one day give an account; yet, in that bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> which, being mi&s;under&s;tood among&s;t his good Subjects, had been u&s;ed as an Argument, as if he were not Vigilant enough for the publick &s;afety, and le&s;t he &s;hould be thought le&s;s Con&s;tant in his re&s;olutions, and that Bill to be the &s;ame he had &s;ent to them, he thought fit to give them, and all the world particular &s;atisfaction, why he could not, Ought not, Mu&s;t not pa&s;s That Bill, being the fir&s;t publick Bill he had refu&s;ed this Parliament: and therefore, he told them, he mu&s;t com|plain, that having expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o clearly and particularly to them in that point, they &s;hould pre&s;s any thing upon him, which they could not but fore&s;ee he mu&s;t refu&s;e; except he departed from tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> re&s;olutions, grounded upon &s;o much rea&s;on, he had &s;o earne&s;tly before acquainted them with, and again&s;t which they had not given one Ar|gument to &s;atisfy his judgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE told them, he was plea&s;ed, they had declined the Unwarranta|ble cour&s;e of their Ordinance (to the which, he was confident, his good Subjects would never have yielded their con&s;ent) and cho&s;en that only right way of impo&s;ing upon the People, which he would have allowed but for the rea&s;ons following:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE &s;aid, he had refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to their Ordinance, as for other things, &s;o for that the power was put into the per&s;ons Nominated <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> therein by direction of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, excluding his Ma|je&s;ty from any power in the di&s;po&s;ition, or execution of it together with them: He had then advi&s;ed them, for many rea&s;ons, that a Bill &s;hould be prepared; and after in his An&s;wer of the 26^t^h of <HI>March</HI> to the Petition of both Hou&s;es, he had told them, if &s;uch a Bill &s;hould be prepared with that due regard to his Maje&s;ty, and care of his People, in the limitation of the power, and other circum&s;tances, he &s;hould recede from nothing he formerly expre&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WHAT pa&s;&s;ed (enough to have di&s;couraged him from being further Sollicitous in that Argument) after his full, and gracious An&s;wers, he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> was content to forge$. When he re&s;olved on his Journey into <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o that by rea&s;on of his ab&s;ence, there might be no want of &s;ettling that power; be&s;ides complying with their fears; he &s;ent, together with a Me&s;&s;age of that his purpo&s;e, a Bill for &s;ettling the power for a year; hoping in that time to return to them, and being &s;ure that, in much le&s;s time, they might do the bu&s;ine&s;s, for which at fir&s;t they &s;eem'd to de&s;ire this; which was, that they might &s;ecurely con&s;ider his Me&s;&s;age of the 20^t^h of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t. By that Bill, which he &s;ent, he con&s;ented to tho&s;e Names they propo&s;ed to their Ordinance, and in the limitation of the power; provided, that him&s;elf &s;hould not be able <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> to execute any thing but by their advice; and, when he &s;hould be out of the Kingdom, the Sole execution to be in them; with many other things, of &s;o Arbitrary, and Uncircum&s;cribed a power, that he &s;hould

not have con&s;ented to, but with reference to the ab&s;ence of his own Per&s;on out of the Kingdom; and thought it the more &s;ufferable, in re&s;pect the time was but for a year. Whether that Bill, they had &s;ent to him to pa&s;s, were the &s;ame,</Q> the world would judge.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE &s;aid, they had, by that Bill tender'd to his Maje&s;ty, without taking notice of him, put the Power of the whole Kingdom, the Life and Liberties of the Subjects of all degrees, and qualities, into the hands of Particular Men, for two years: He asked them, if they could ima|gin he would tru&s;t &s;uch an Ab&s;olute power in the hands of Particular <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Per&s;ons, which he had refu&s;ed to commit to both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment? Nay, if the Power it &s;elf were not too Ab&s;olute, too Unlimited to be committed into any Private hands? Whether S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s high in&s;olence &s;hewed him not, what he might expect from an Exor|bitant legal power, when he, by a power not warrantable by Law, dur&s;t venture upon a Trea&s;onable di&s;obedience? but his Maje&s;ty would willingly know, and indeed &s;uch an account in ordinary civility, he &s;aid, he might have expected, why he was, by that Act, ab&s;olutely Excluded, from any Power, or Authority in the Execution of the Mi|litia. He &s;aid, &s;ure their Fears and Jealou&s;ies were not of &s;uch a Na|ture, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> as were capable of no other remedy, than by leaving him No power in a point of the greate&s;t importance; in which God, and the Law, had tru&s;ted him Solely, and which he had been contented to Share with them by his own Bill, by putting It, and a Greater, into the hands of particular Subjects. He asked them, what all Chri&s;tian Princes would think of him, after he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Bill&punc; How they would value his Soveraignty? And yet, he &s;aid, &s;ure His Reputation with Forreign Princes was &s;ome ground of Their Security. Nay, he was confident, by that time they had throughly con&s;ider'd the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equence of that Bill, upon Them&s;elves, and the re&s;t of his good <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Subjects, they would All give him Thanks for Not con&s;enting to it; finding their condition, if it &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed, would not have been &s;o plea&s;ing to them. He told them, he hoped that Animadver&s;ion would be no breach of their Priviledges. In that throng of bu&s;ine&s;s and di&s;temper of affections, it was po&s;&s;ible, Second thoughts might pre&s;ent &s;omewhat to their con&s;iderations,</Q> which e&s;caped them before.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE remember'd them, that he had pa&s;&s;ed a Bill, this Parliament, at their entreaty, concerning the captives of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and waved many objections of his own to the contrary, upon information that the bu&s;i|ne&s;s had been many Months con&s;ider'd by them; whether it proved <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;uitable to their intentions, or whether they had not, by &s;ome private Orders, &s;u&s;pended that Act of Parliament upon view of the mi&s;takes, Them&s;elves be&s;t knew; as likewi&s;e, what other great Alterations they had made upon other Bills, pa&s;&s;ed this Se&s;&s;ion. He told them, he could not pa&s;s over the putting Their Names out of that Bill, whom before they had recommended to him in their Ordinance, not thinking fit, it &s;eem'd, to tru&s;t tho&s;e, who would obey no Guide but the Law of the Land (he Imagined they would not wi&s;h he &s;hould in his e&s;timation of others follow that their Rule) and the leaving out, by &s;pecial pro|vi&s;ion, the pre&s;ent Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> as a per&s;on in their disfa|vour; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> whereas, he &s;aid, he mu&s;t tell them, his demeanour had been &s;uch, that the City, and the whole Kingdom, was beholding to him for his example.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;To conclude, he &s;aid, he did not find him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an

Exce&s;s of power, that it was fit to transfer, or con&s;ent it &s;hould be in other Per&s;ons, as was directed by that Bill; and therefore, he &s;hould rely upon that Royal right and juri&s;diction, which God, and the Law had given him, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Rebellion, and re&s;i&s;ting Forreign Inva&s;ion; which had pre&s;erved the Kingdom in the time of all his Ance&s;tors, and which, he doubted not, but he &s;hould be able to exe|cute. And, not more for his own honour and right, than for the li|berty and &s;afety of his People,</Q> he could not con&s;ent to pa&s;s that Bill.</P>
<P>THO' no &s;ober man could deny the rea&s;onablene&s;s of that An&s;wer, and that there was indeed &s;o great a difference between the Bill &s;ent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> by his Maje&s;ty, and that pre&s;ented to him from the two Hou&s;es, that it could not &s;oberly be imagined he would con&s;ent to it; yet, it had been better for his Maje&s;ty, that the fir&s;t Overture from him&s;elf had ne|ver been made; it giving New life, &s;pirit, and hopes to them; and they making the People believe (who under&s;tood not the difference, and knew not that the King&punc;s plea&s;ure, &s;ignify'd by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, was in effect the plea&s;ure of both Hou&s;es without the King) that his Maje&s;ty now refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to what him&s;elf had offer'd, and pro|po&s;ed; whil&s;t his own Party (for &s;o tho&s;e begun now to be called, who pre&s;erved their Duty, and Allegiance entire) was as much troubled to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> find &s;o &s;overaign a power of the Crown offer'd to be parted with to the two Hou&s;es, as was tender'd to them by the King's own Bill; and that it was po&s;&s;ible for his Maje&s;ty to recede from his firme&s;t Re&s;olves, even in a point, that would not naturally admit of the lea&s;t divi&s;ion, or di|minution.</P>
<P>THE King, being well plea&s;ed that he had gone through one of his re&s;olutions, and not much troubled at the anger it had produced, and finding his Court full of Per&s;ons of Quality of the Country, who made all expre&s;&s;ions of affection and duty, which they thought would be mo&s;t acceptable to him, re&s;olved to undertake an other enterpri&s;e, which was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of more importance, and which in truth was the &s;ole motive of his Journey into tho&s;e parts. The great Magazine of Armes and Ammu|nition, which was left upon the disbanding the Army, remained &s;till at <HI>Hull,</HI> and was a nobler proportion than remained in the Tower of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> or all other his Maje&s;ty's Stores; and there had been formerly a purpo&s;e to have &s;ecured the &s;ame by the Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s pre&s;ence there, which had been di&s;appointed, as hath been before mentioned, and S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> &s;ent thither to look to it; who was now there only with One of the Companies of the Traind-bands; and &s;o the King re|&s;olved that he would Him&s;elf make a Journey thither, with his own <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> U&s;ual Train; and being there, that he would &s;tay there, till he had &s;e|cured the place to him. This was his purpo&s;e; which he concealed to that degree, that very few about him knew any thing of it.</P>
<P>ASSOON as it was known that his Maje&s;ty meant to re&s;ide in <HI>York,</HI> it was ea&s;ily &s;u&s;pected, that he had an eye upon That Magazine; and there|fore they made an Order in both Hou&s;es, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Magazine &s;hould be removed from <HI>Hull</HI> to the Tower;</Q> and Ships were making ready for the Tran&s;portation; &s;o that his Maje&s;ty could no longer defer the exe|cution of what he de&s;igned. And, being per&s;waded, by &s;ome who be|lieved them&s;elves, that if he went thither, it would neither be in S^r <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s Will, nor his Power, to keep him out of that Town; and that, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o con&s;iderable a Po&s;t, and of the Magazine there, he &s;hould find a better temper towards a Mode&s;t, and Dutiful Treaty;
<PB N="397" REF="4150">
his Maje&s;ty took the opportunity of a Petition pre&s;ented to him by the Gentlemen of <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> (who in truth were much troubled at the Or|der for removing the Magazine from <HI>Hull;</HI> and were ready to appear in any thing for his Service) in which, <Q>&startq;&endq;they de&s;ired him to ca&s;t his eye, and thoughts upon the &s;afety of his own Per&s;on, and his Princely I&s;&s;ue, and that whole County; a great means whereof, they &s;aid, did con|&s;i&s;t in the Armes, and Ammunition at <HI>Hull,</HI> placed there by his Prince|ly care and charge; and &s;ince, upon general apprehen&s;ions of dangers from forreign parts, thought fit to be continued: and they did very <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> earne&s;tly be&s;eech him, that he would take &s;uch cour&s;e, that it might &s;till remain there, for the better &s;ecuring tho&s;e, and the re&s;t of the Northern parts.</Q> Hereupon, he re&s;olved to go thither him&s;elf; and, the night before, he &s;ent his Son the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who was lately ar|rived from <HI>Richmond,</HI> accompanied with the Prince Elector, thither, with &s;ome other per&s;ons of Honour; who knew no more, than that it was a Journey given to the plea&s;ure, and curio&s;ity of the Duke. S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> received them with that duty, and civility that became him. The next morning early, the King took Hor&s;e from <HI>York;</HI> and, attended with two or three hundred of his Servants, and Gentlemen of the Coun|try, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> rode thither; and, when he came within a Mile of the Town, &s;ent a Gentleman to S^r <HI>John Hotham,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;to let him know that the King would that day dine with him;</Q> with which he was &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed, or Seemed to be &s;o.</P>
<P>THE man was of a fearful nature, and perplexed under&s;tanding, and could better re&s;olve upon deliberation than on a &s;uddain; and many were of opinion, that if he had been prepared dextrou&s;ly before hand, and in confidence, he would have conformed to the King's plea&s;ure; for he was ma&s;ter of a Noble fortune in Land, and rich in Money; of a very ancient Family, and well Allied; his Affections to the Government ve|ry <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> good; and no man le&s;s de&s;ired to &s;ee the Nation involved in a Civil War, than He: and, when he accepted this imployment from the Par|liament, he never imagined it would engage him in Rebellion; but be|lieved, that the King would find it nece&s;&s;ary to comply with the Advice of his two Hou&s;es; and that the pre&s;erving that Magazine from being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him, would likewi&s;e prevent any po&s;&s;ible rupture into Armes. He was now in great confu&s;ion; and calling &s;ome of the chief Magi&s;trates, and other Officers together to con&s;ult, they per&s;waded him, not to &s;uf|fer the King to enter into the Town. And his Maje&s;ty coming within an hour after his Me&s;&s;enger found the Gates &s;hut, and the Bridges drawn, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and the Walls mann'd; all things being in a readine&s;s for the reception of an Enemy.

And when he excu&s;ed him&s;elf like|wi&s;e from That, his Maje&s;ty told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that as this Act of his was un|parallel'd, &s;o it would produce &s;ome notable Effect; that it was not

po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;it down by &s;uch an Indignity, but that he would immediately Proclaim him Traitor, and proceed again&s;t him as &s;uch; that this di&s;obedience of his would probably bring many mi&s;eries upon the Kingdom, and much lo&s;s of Blood; all which might be prevented, if he performed the duty of a Subject; and therefore advi&s;ed him to think &s;adly of it, and to prevent the nece&s;&s;ary growth of &s;o many Ca|lamities,</Q> which mu&s;t lie all upon His Con&s;cience. The Gentleman, with much di&s;traction in his looks, talked confu&s;edly of the <Q>&startq;&endq;Tru&s;t he had from the Parliament; then fell on his knees, and wi&s;hed, "that God would bring Confu&s;ion upon Him, and His, if he were not a Loyal <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and Faithful Subject to his Maje&s;ty; but, in conclu&s;ion, plainly denied to &s;uffer his Maje&s;ty to come into the Town.</Q> Whereupon, the King cau&s;ed him immediately to be proclaim'd a Traitor; which the Other received with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of Undutifulne&s;s and Contempt.

How his Refu|&s;al to have that Magazine removed, upon the Petition of both Hou&s;es, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> could give any advantage again&s;t him, to have it taken from him, and whether it was a Refu&s;al, all men would ea&s;ily under&s;tand, who read his An&s;wer to that Petition; to which, it had not been yet thought fit, to make any Reply.</Q></P>

For the Number of his At|tendants, tho' that could be no Warrant for &s;uch a di&s;obedience in a Subject, he &s;aid, it was well known (as his Maje&s;ty had expre&s;&s;ed in his Me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es, to which credit ought to have been given) that he offer&punc;d to go into the Town with twenty Hor&s;e only, his whole Train being Unarmed; and who&s;oever thought that too great an At|tendance <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> for his Maje&s;ty, and his two Sons, had &s;ure an intention to bring him to a meaner Retinue,</Q> than they would yet avow.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HERE then, he &s;aid, was his Ca&s;e, of which all the world &s;hould judge: his Maje&s;ty endeavoured to vi&s;it a Town, and Fort of his own, wherein his own Magazine lay; a Subject, in defiance of him, &s;huts the Gates again&s;t him; with Armed Men re&s;i&s;ts, denies, and oppo&s;es his en|trance; tells him, in plain terms, he &s;hould not come in.

And whether he were &s;o, or no, if he would render him&s;elf, his Maje&s;ty would require no other Trial, than that which the Law had appointed to every Subject, and which he was confident he had not, in the lea&s;t degree, violated in tho&s;e proceedings; no more than he had done the Priviledge of Parlia|ment, by endeavouring, in a ju&s;t way, to challenge his Own unque&s;tion|able Priviledges. So that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the declaring him Traitor, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> being a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, without proce&s;s of Law, &s;hould be a breach of Priviledge of Parliament (of which he was &s;ure none extended to Trea&s;on&punc; Felony, or breach of Peace) again&s;t the Li|berty of the Subject, or again&s;t the Law of the Land, he mu&s;t have Other rea&s;ons than bare Votes.

Would Fears and Jealou&s;ies di&s;pence with nece&s;&s;ary, and real Forms? And <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> mu&s;t his Maje&s;ty, when actual War is levied upon him, ob&s;erve Forms which the Law it &s;elf doth not enjoyn?

<P><PB N="405" REF="4230">
<Q>&startq;&endq;HE &s;aid, he had often heard of the great Tru&s;t, that, by the Law of God and Man, was committed to the King for the defence, and &s;afety of his People; but as yet he never under&s;tood, what Tru&s;t or Power was committed to Either, or Both Hou&s;es of Parliament, with|out the King; They being &s;ummon'd to Coun&s;el, and Advi&s;e the King.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEREFORE he expected, that upon further, and better con&s;idera|tion of the great, and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Hull,</HI> and &s;eriou&s;ly weighing, how much it did concern the Peace, and Quiet of the Kingdom, They would, without further in&s;tance from his Ma|je&s;ty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> give him full, and &s;peedy Ju&s;tice again&s;t S^r <HI>John Hotham.</HI> And, he &s;aid, he would leave all his good People to think, what hope of Ju&s;tice there was left for Them, when they Refu&s;ed, or Delayed to give their own Soveraign &s;atisfaction.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND he &s;aid, he likewi&s;e expected that They would not put the Militia in execution, until they could &s;hew him by what Law they had Authority to do the &s;ame, without His con&s;ent; or if they did, he was confident, that he &s;hould find much more obedience according to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Law, than they would do again&s;t Law.

<P>THE Militia was the Argument, which They found made deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion in the People, being totally ignorant what it was, or what the con&s;equence of it might be; and &s;o believing what&s;oever They told them concerning it. And therefore they re&s;olved to drive that Nail home; and tho', for want of their Imminent Danger, and during the time of the King's Treaty, and Overture of a Bill, they had forborn the execution of their Ordinance; yet the frequent Mu&s;ters of Volunteers without Order, allmo&s;t in all Countries, by the bare Authority of their Votes, gave them &s;ufficient Evidence how open the People were to their Commands; at lea&s;t how unprepared Authority was to re&s;i&s;t, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> oppo&s;e them: and therefore, after the King had di&s;placed their two Fa|vourites, and refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the Bill for the Militia, and S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> had refu&s;ed to let the King come into the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and They had Ju&s;tify'd him for &s;o doing, they prepared a Declaration concerning the whole State of the Militia, as the Re&s;olution of the Lords and Com|mons upon that matter; in which they &s;aid,</P>

<P>THEY, who contrived this Scene, never doubted, but after a Re&s;o|lution what was to be done upon a Suppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity, they &s;hould ea|&s;ily, when they found it Convenient, make that nece&s;&s;ity Real. It was no hard matter to make the Fearful, apprehen&s;ive of Dangers; and the Jealous, of De&s;igns; and they wanted not Evidence of all kinds; of Let|ters from abroad, and Di&s;coveries at home, to make tho&s;e apprehen|&s;ions formidable enough; and then, tho', Before the Re&s;olution, there was a great latitude in Law and Rea&s;on, what was Lawfully to be done, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> they had Now forejudged them&s;elves, and Re&s;olved of the Proper re|medy, except they would argue again&s;t the Evidence; which U&s;ually would have been to di&s;countenance, or undervalue &s;ome Per&s;on of no|table reputation, or his Corre&s;pondence; and allways, to have oppo&s;ed That that was of &s;uch an Allay, as, in truth, did operate upon the Major part.

For, how ea&s;y a matter is it to make it appear to that man, who con&s;ented that the King Intended to make War again&s;t the Parliament, that when he &s;hould Do it, he had broken his Oath, and di&s;&s;olved his Government; and, that who&s;oever &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him were Traitors?

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR this purpo&s;e, they had drawn his Maje&s;ty into the Northern Parts far from the Parliament; that &s;o fal&s;e Rumours might have time to get Credit, and the ju&s;t Defences of the Parliament find a more te|dious, difficult, and di&s;advantageous acce&s;s, after tho&s;e fal&s;e Imputa|tions, and Slanders had been fir&s;t rooted in the apprehen&s;ion of his Ma|je&s;ty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and his Subjects; which the more &s;peedily to effect, they had cau&s;ed a Pre&s;s to be tran&s;ported to <HI>York,</HI> from whence &s;everal Papers, and Writings of that kind were conveyed to all parts of the Kingdom, without the Authority of the Great Seal, in an Unu&s;ual and Illegal manner, and without the Advice of his Maje&s;ty's Privy Council; from the greater and better part whereof having withdrawn him&s;elf, as well as from his Great Council of Parliament, he was thereby expo&s;ed to the wicked and unfaithful Coun&s;els of &s;uch, as had made the Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of the Parliament dangerous to them&s;elves; and that dan|ger they labour'd to prevent by hiding their own Guilt under the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Name, and &s;hadow of the King; infu&s;ing into him their own Fears, and, as much as in them lay, a&s;per&s;ing his Royal Per&s;on and Honour with their own Infamy; from both which it had allways been as much the Care, as it was the Duty of the Parliament to pre&s;erve his Maje&s;ty, and to fix the Guilt of all evil Actions and Coun&s;els upon tho&s;e, who had been the Authors of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AMONG divers Writings of that kind, they &s;aid, They the Lords and Commons in Parliament, had taken into their con&s;iderations two Printed Papers; the fir&s;t containing a Declaration, which they had re|ceived from his Maje&s;ty in An&s;wer to that which had been pre&s;ented <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to his Maje&s;ty from both Hou&s;es at <HI>New-Market,</HI> the ninth of <HI>March</HI> 1641. the other, his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the Petition of both Hou&s;es, pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty the 26^t^h of <HI>March</HI> 1642. Both which were filled with har&s;h Cen&s;ures, and cau&s;le&s;s Charges upon the Parliament; concerning which they held it nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;atisfaction to the Kingdom; &s;eeing they found it very difficult to &s;atisfy his Maje&s;ty, whom, to their great grief, they had found to be &s;o engaged to, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, which evil Coun&s;ellors have wrought in him, that their mo&s;t humble and faithful Remon&s;trances had rather irritated and imbitter'd, than any thing allayed, or mitigated <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the &s;harp Expre&s;&s;ions, which his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to make in An&s;wer to them; for the manife&s;tation whereof, and of their own Inno|cency, they de&s;ired that all his Maje&s;ty's loving Subjects might take notice of the&s;e Particulars:</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was framed and cheri&s;hed by the Popi&s;h, and Malignant Party in <HI>England,</HI> was not only affirm'd by the Rebels, but, they &s;aid, might be clear'd by many other Proofs: the &s;ame Rebellious Principles of pretended Religion, the &s;ame politick Ends were apparent in both, and their malicious De&s;igns and Practices were ma&s;qued, and di&s;gui&s;ed with the &s;ame fal&s;e colour of their earne&s;t Zeal to vindicate his Maje&s;ty's Prerogative, from the &s;uppo&s;ed oppre&s;|&s;ion of the Parliament. How much tho&s;e treacherous Pretences had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> been countenanced, by &s;ome evil Council about his Maje&s;ty, might appear in this, that the Proclamation, whereby they were declared Traitors, was &s;o long withheld, as to the &s;econd of <HI>January,</HI> tho' the Rebellion broke forth in <HI>October</HI> before, and then no more than forty Copies appointed to be printed; with a &s;pecial Command from his Ma|je&s;ty not to exceed that Number; and that none of them &s;hould be publi&s;hed, till his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure was further &s;ignify'd, as by the Warrant appears, a true Copy whereof was annex'd to this Declara|tion; &s;o that a few only could take notice of it; which was made more ob&s;ervable, by the late contrary Proceedings again&s;t the Scots, who <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> were in a very quick and &s;harp manner Proclaimed; and tho&s;e Procla|mations forthwith di&s;per&s;ed, with as much diligence as might be, throughout all the Kingdom, and order'd to be read in all Churches, accompanied with Publick Prayers, and Execrations. Another Evi|dence of favour and countenance to the Rebels in &s;ome of Power about his Maje&s;ty, was this, that they had put forth, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, a cau&s;le&s;s complaint again&s;t the Parliament, which &s;peaks the &s;ame Language of the Parliament which the Rebels do, the$eby to rai&s;e a belief in men's minds, that his Maje&s;ty's Affections were alienated, as well as his Per&s;on was removed, from that his Great Council.

So long as tho&s;e Members had not the means of clearing their Innocency, and the Authors of that malicious Charge were un|di&s;cover'd, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> tho' both Hou&s;es of Parliament had &s;everal times Petition'd his Maje&s;ty to di&s;cover them, and that, not only upon the grounds of Common Ju&s;tice, but by Act of Parliament, his Maje&s;ty was bound to do it? So long as the King refu&s;ed to pa&s;s a Bill for their di&s;charge, alledging that the Narrative in that Bill was again&s;t his Honour; where$y he &s;eem'd &s;till to avow the Matter of that fal&s;e and &s;canda|lous Accu&s;ation, tho' he de&s;erted the Pro&s;ecution, offering to pa&s;s a Bill for their Acquittal; yet with intimation that they mu&s;t de&s;ert the avowing their own Innocency, which would more wound them in Honour, than &s;ecure them in Law? And in Vindication of that great <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Priviledge of Parliament, they did not know that they had invaded any Priviledge belonging to his Maje&s;ty, as had been alledg'd in that Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BuT, they &s;aid, they looked not upon that only in the notion of a Breach of Priviledge, which might be, tho' the Accu&s;ation were true or fal&s;e; but under the notion of a heinous Crime in the Atturney, and all other Subjects, who had a hand in it; a Crime again&s;t the Law of Nature, again&s;t the Rules of Ju&s;tice; that Innocent men &s;hould be charged with &s;o great an offence as Trea&s;on, in the face of the highe&s;t Judicatory of the Kingdom, whereby their Lives and E&s;tates, their <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Blood and Honour were endanger'd, without Witne&s;s, without Evi|dence, without all po&s;&s;ibility of Reparation in a legal Cour&s;e; yet a Crime of &s;uch a nature, that his Maje&s;ty&punc;s Command can no more

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;To that point of upholding, and maintaining his Royal Authority, they &s;aid, nothing had been done to the prejudice of it, that &s;hould require any new Provi&s;ion: To the other of &s;ettling the Revenue, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the Parliament had no way abridg'd, or di&s;order'd his ju&s;t revenue; but it was true, that much Wa&s;te, and Confu&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's E&s;tate, had been made by tho&s;e evil and unfaithful Mini&s;ters, whom he had imploy'd in the managing of it; whereby his own ordinary Expences

would have been di&s;appointed, and the &s;afety of the Kingdom more endanger'd if the Parliament had not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, provided for his Hou&s;hold, and for &s;ome of the Forts, more than they were bound to do; and they were &s;till willing to &s;ettle &s;uch a Revenue upon his Maje&s;ty, as might make him live Royally, Plentifully, and Safely; but they could not, in wi&s;dom, and fidelity to the Common-wealth, do that, till he &s;hould cho&s;e &s;uch Coun&s;ellors and Officers, as might order and di&s;po&s;e it to the publick Good, and not apply it to the ruin, and de&s;truction of his People, as heretofore it had been. But that, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and the other matters concerning them&s;elves, being works of great im|portance, and full of intricacy, would require &s;o long a time of Deli|beration, that the Kingdom might be ruin&punc;d before they could effect them: Therefore they thought it nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to be Suitors to his Maje&s;ty, &s;o to order the Militia, that, the Kingdom being &s;ecured, they might, with more ea&s;e and &s;afety&punc; apply them&s;elves to debate of that Me&s;&s;age, wherein they had been interrupted, by his Maje&s;ty's de|nial of the Ordinance concerning the &s;ame; becau&s;e it would have been in vain for them to Labour in other things, and in the mean time, to leave them&s;elves naked to the malice of &s;o many Enemies, both at home and abroad; yet they had not been alltogether negligent <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of tho&s;e things, which his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to propound in that Me&s;&s;age: They had agreed upon a Book of Rates in a larger pro|portion, than had been granted to any of his Maje&s;ty Predece&s;&s;ors, which was a con&s;iderable &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's publick charge; and had likewi&s;e prepared divers Propo&s;itions, and Bills, for pre&s;ervation of their Religion and Liberties, which they intended &s;hortly to pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty; and to do what&s;oever was fit for them, to make up that unplea&s;ant breach between his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WHEREAS divers exceptions had been taken concerning the Mi|litia; fir&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty never denied the Thing, but accepted the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Per&s;ons (except for Corporations) only that he denied the Way; to which they An&s;wer'd, That that Exception took off <HI>London,</HI> and all other great Towns and Cities, which make a great part of the King|dom; and for the way of Ordinance, it is ancient, more &s;peedy, more ea&s;ily alterable, and in all the&s;e, and other re&s;pects, more proper, and more applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, than a Bill; which his Maje&s;ty called, the good old way of impo&s;ing upon the Subjects.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY wi&s;hed the Danger were not Imminent, or not &s;till conti|nuing, but could not conceive, that the long time &s;pent in that de|bate was evidence &s;ufficient, that there was no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity or dan|ger, but a Bill might ea&s;ily have been prepared; for, when many cau&s;es do concur to the danger of a State, the interruption of any one might hinder the execution of the re&s;t, and yet the de&s;ign be &s;till kept on foot, for better opportunities.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IT was declared, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, that he re&s;olv'd to keep the Rule Him&s;elf, and, to his power, to require the &s;ame of all others. They &s;aid, they mu&s;t needs acknowledge, that &s;uch a re&s;olution was like to bring much happine&s;s, and ble&s;&s;ing to his Maje&s;ty, and $ll his Kingdoms; yet, with humility, they mu&s;t confe&s;s, they had not the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Fruit of it in that Ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the other five Mem|bers, accu&s;ed contrary to Law, both Common and the Statute Law; and yet remained un&s;atisfy'd: Which Ca&s;e had been remember'd, in their Declaration, as a &s;trange and unheard of Violation of their Laws: But the Penner of that An&s;wer thought fit to pa&s;s it over, hoping that many would read his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer, which had been &s;o carefully di&s;per&s;ed, who would not read their Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WHEREAS, after their ample thanks, and acknowledgment of his Maje&s;ty's favour in pa&s;&s;ing many good Bills, they had &s;aid, that truth and nece&s;&s;ity inforced them to add this, that in, or about the time of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Bills, &s;ome De&s;ign or other had been on foot, which, if it had taken effect, would not only have deprived them of the Fruit of tho&s;e Bills, but would have reduced them to a wor&s;e condition of con|fu&s;ion, than that wherein the Parliament found them: it was now told them, that the King mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of what they had ca&s;t upon him, for the requital of tho&s;e good Bills; whereas, out of their u&s;ual tenderne&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's honour, they did not mention Him at all; but &s;o injurious, they &s;aid, were tho&s;e wicked Coun&s;ellors to the Name, and Honour of their Ma&s;ter and Soveraign, that, as much as they could, they laid their own Infamy and Guilt upon His Shoulders. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HERE, they ob&s;erv&punc;d, God al&s;o was called to witne&s;s his Maje&s;ty's upright intentions at the pa&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e Laws; which, they &s;aid, they would not que&s;tion, neither did they give any occa&s;ion for &s;uch a &s;olemn A&s;&s;everation, as that was; the Devil was likewi&s;e defied to prove there was any de&s;ign, with his Maje&s;ty's knowledge or privity. That might well have been &s;pared; for they &s;pake nothing of his Ma|je&s;ty: but &s;ince they were &s;o far taxed, as to have it affirmed, that they had laid a fal&s;e, and notorious Imputation upon his Maje&s;ty, they thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the ju&s;t defence of their own Innocency, to cau&s;e the Oaths and Examinations, which had been taken, concerning <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> the De&s;ign, to be publi&s;hed in a full Narration, for &s;atisfaction of all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects; out of which they would now offer &s;ome few Particulars, by which the world might judge, whether they could

proceed with more tenderne&s;s towards his Maje&s;ty, than they had done.

The&s;e things being &s;o, it would ea&s;ily appear to be as much again&s;t the Rules of Prudence, that the Penner of that An&s;wer &s;hould entangle his Maje&s;ty in that unnece&s;&s;ary Apology, as it was again&s;t the Rules of Ju&s;tice, that any Reparation from Them <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;hould be either yielded, or demanded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IT was profe&s;&s;ed, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, that he is truly &s;en&s;ible of the Burthens of his People; which made them hope, that he would take that cour&s;e, which would be mo&s;t effectual to ea&s;e them of tho&s;e burthens, that was, to joyn with his Parliament in pre&s;erving the Peace of the Kingdom, which, by his Ab&s;ence from them, had been much endanger'd; and which, by hindering the voluntary Adventures for the recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and di&s;abling the Subjects to di&s;charge the great Tax impo&s;ed on them, was like to make the War much more heavy to the Kingdom. And for his Maje&s;ty's Wants, the Parliament <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> had been no cau&s;e of them; They had not dimini&s;hed his ju&s;t Revenue, but had much ea&s;ed his Publick Charge, and &s;omewhat his Private; and they &s;hould be ready, in a Parliamentary way, to &s;ettle his Re|venue in &s;uch an Honourable proportion, as might be an&s;werable to both, when he &s;hould put him&s;elf into &s;uch a po&s;ture of Government, that his Subjects might be &s;ecure to enjoy his ju&s;t Protection for their Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</Q></P>

(That it was a &s;trange world, when Princes proffer'd Favours were counted Reproaches: &s;uch were the words of his Maje&s;ty's An|&s;wer) who did e&s;teem that Offer as an Act of Princely Grace and Boun|ty, which, &s;ince the Parliament begun, they had humbly de&s;ired they might obtain, and did &s;till hold it very nece&s;&s;ary, and advantageous for the generality of the Subject, upon whom the Taxes and Sub&s;idies lie heavie&s;t: but, they &s;aid, they &s;aw, upon every Occa&s;ion, how unhap|py they were in his Maje&s;ty's mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of their Words, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Actions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY &s;aid, they were fully of the King's mind, as it was there de|clared, that he might re&s;t &s;o &s;ecure of the Affections of his Subjects,

They &s;aid, they were mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured of the faithfulne&s;s of the City, and Suburbs; and for Them|&s;elves, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> they &s;hould quicken the Vigour of the Laws, and Indu&s;try of the Magi&s;trate, the Authority of Parliament, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of all Tumultuary in&s;olency what&s;oever, and, for the vindicating of his Ho|nour from all in&s;upportable and in&s;olent Scandals, if any &s;uch &s;hall be found to be rai&s;ed upon him, as were mention'd in that An&s;wer: and therefore they thought it alltogether unnece&s;&s;ary, and exceeding in|convenient, to Adjourn the Parliament to any other place.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY &s;aid, they had given his Maje&s;ty no cau&s;e to &s;ay, that they did meanly value the di&s;charge of his publick duty; what&s;oever Acts <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of Grace or Ju&s;tice had been done, they proceeded from his Maje&s;ty by the Advice and Coun&s;el of his Parliament, yet they had and &s;hould allways An&s;wer them with con&s;tant gratitude, and obedience, and af|fection; and altho' many things had been done, &s;ince this Parliament, of another nature, yet they &s;hould not cea&s;e to de&s;ire the continued Protection of Allmighty God upon his Maje&s;ty, and mo&s;t humbly Pe|tition him to ca&s;t from him all tho&s;e evil, and contrary Coun&s;els, which had, in many Particulars formerly mention'd, much detracted from the Honour of his Government, the Happine&s;s of his own E&s;tate, and Pro&s;perity of his People.</Q></P>

<P>WITH this Declaration they publi&s;h'd the Examinations of M^r <HI>Goring,</HI> M^r <HI>Percy</HI>'s Letter to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> which were the great Evidence they had of the Plot of bringing up the Army, to awe the Parliament; and &s;everal other Letters and Depo&s;itions, or rather <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> &s;uch parts of Depo&s;itions, as contributed mo&s;t to their purpo&s;e.

And yet with all tho&s;e ill Arts and Omi&s;&s;ions, I pre&s;ume many, who without pa&s;&s;ion do now read tho&s;e Depo&s;itions (for they are in all <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> hands to be read) do much marvel how &s;uch conclu&s;ions could re&s;ult to his Maje&s;ty's di&s;advantage, out of the wor&s;t part of all that Evidence; which could not, naturally, carry that &s;en&s;e to which it was wre&s;ted.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time (which I &s;hall mention before the other Declara|tion&punc; becau&s;e it interven'd) there happen'd an Accident that gave them much trouble, and the more, becau&s;e unlooked for, by the Lord Keeper's quitting them and re&s;orting to <HI>York,</HI> by which the King got the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his own Great Seal; which by all Parties was, at that time, thought a mo&s;t con&s;iderable advantage. The King was very much un&s;atisfy'd with the Lord Keeper <HI>Littleton;</HI> who did not appear &s;o u&s;eful for his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Service as he expected, and, from the time of the Accu&s;ing the Mem|bers, had lo&s;t all his Vigour, and in&s;tead of making any oppo&s;itions to any of their extravagant Debates, he had &s;ilently &s;uffer'd all things to

be carried; and had not only declined the performing the Office the King had enjoyn'd him, with reference to the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> (be|fore mention'd) but very much complied with, and courted that Party of both Hou&s;es, which frequently re&s;orted to him; and of late in a que&s;tion, which had been put in the Hou&s;e of Peers, in the point of the Militia, he had given his Vote both again&s;t the King and the Law, to the infinite offence and &s;candal of all tho&s;e who adhered to the King.</P>
<P>HE was a man of great reputation in the profe&s;&s;ion of the Law; for Learning, and all other advantages, which attend the mo&s;t Eminent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Men; he was of a very good extraction in <HI>Shrop&punc;&s;hire,</HI> and inherited a fair Fortune, and Inheritance from his Father; he was a hand&s;ome, and a proper Man, of a very graceful Pre&s;ence, and notorious for Courage, which, in his Youth, he had manife&s;ted with his Sword; he had taken great pains in the harde&s;t, and mo&s;t knotty part of the Law, as well as that which was more cu&s;tomary, and was not only very ready and expert in the Books, but exceedingly ver&s;ed in Records, in &s;tudying and examining whereof, he had kept M^r <HI>Selden</HI> company, with whom he had great friend&s;hip, and who had much a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; &s;o that he was looked upon the be&s;t Antiquary of the profe&s;&s;ion, who gave him&s;elf up <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to Practice; and, upon the meer &s;trength of his own abilities, he had rai&s;ed him&s;elf into the fir&s;t rank of the Practicers in the Common Law Courts, and was cho&s;en Recorder of <HI>London</HI> before he was called to the Bench, and grew pre&s;ently into the highe&s;t Practice in all the other Courts, as well as tho&s;e of the Law. When the King looked more nar|rowly into his bu&s;ine&s;s, and found that he &s;hould have much to do in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> he removed an old, u&s;ele&s;s, illiterate Per&s;on, who had been put into that Office by the favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and made <HI>Littleton</HI> his Sollicitor General, much to his Honour, but not to his Profit; the obligation of Attendance upon that Office, depriving him <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of much benefit he u&s;ed to acquire by his Practice, before he had that relation. Upon the death of my Lord <HI>Coventry, Finch</HI> being made Keeper, He was made Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, Then the be&s;t Office of the Law, and that which he was wont to &s;ay, in his highe&s;t Ambition, in his own private wi&s;hes, he had mo&s;t de&s;ired; and it was indeed the Sphere in which he moved mo&s;t gracefully, and with mo&s;t advantage, being a ma&s;ter of all that Learning and knowledge, which that Place required, and an excellent Judge, of great Gravity, and above all &s;u&s;picion of Corruption.</P>
<P>WHILST he held this place, he was by the favour of the Arch-Bi&s;hop <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> who had a great e&s;teem of him, recommended to the King to be called to the Council Table, where he kept up his good Name; and, upon the Lord <HI>Finch's</HI> leaving the King|dom, in the beginning of the Parliament, he was thought, in many re|&s;pects, to be the fitte&s;t to be entru&s;ted in that Office; and, upon the de|&s;ire of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> after he was in the Tower, was created a Baron, out of expectation that, by his Authority and Knowledge of the Law, he would have been of great u&s;e in re&s;training tho&s;e extraordinary, and unwarrantable Proceedings; but, from the time he had the Great Seal, he &s;eem'd to be out of his Element, and in &s;ome perplexity and ir|re&s;olution <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> in the Chancery it &s;elf, tho' he had great experience in the practice, and proceedings of that Court; and made not that di&s;patch, that was expected, at the Council Table; and in the Parliament he did not pre&s;erve any dignity; and appear'd &s;o totally di&s;pirited, that few

This wonderful alteration in him, his Friends believed to have proceeded from a great &s;ickne&s;s, which had &s;ei&s;ed upon him quickly after he was created a Baron, in&s;omuch as every Man believed he would die; and by this means, he did not attend the Hou&s;e in &s;ome Months; and &s;o perform'd none of tho&s;e Offices toward the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> the expectation whereof had been the &s;ole Motive to that promotion: From that time he never did appear the &s;ame Man; but &s;ure there were Other cau&s;es for it, and he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ome <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> melancholy apprehen&s;ions, which he could not ma&s;ter, and had no Friend to whom he dur&s;t entirely communicate them.</P>
<P>M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> one of tho&s;e who was mo&s;t tru&s;ted by the King in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and had allways had a great re&s;pect for the Keeper, was as much troubled at his behaviour, as any man; and u&s;ing frequently to go to him, went upon that occa&s;ion; and with great freedom and plainne&s;s, told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;how much he had lo&s;t the e&s;teem of all Good men, and that the King could not but be exceedingly di&s;&s;atisfy'd with him;</Q> and di&s;cour&s;ed over the matter of that Vote. Tho' He did not know, that the King did at that time put &s;o great a &s;ecret Tru&s;t in M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> he knew very well, that the King had a very good opinion of him, and had heard his Maje&s;ty often, from the beginning of the Parliament, when the di&s;cour&s;e happen'd to be of the Lawyers of the Hou&s;e, take an occa&s;ion from thence to mention M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> as a man of whom he heard very well; which the Keeper had many times taken notice of to him: and then he knew the Friend&s;hip that was between the Lord <HI>Falk|land</HI> and M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> and had heard the many Jealou&s;ies which were con|tracted, upon the great communication he had with the two new Coun|&s;ellors; and &s;o no doubt believed, that he knew much of the King's mind. So that a&s;&s;oon as he had enter'd upon this di&s;cour&s;e, which he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> heard with all attention (they being by them&s;elves in his Study, at <HI>Exe|ter</HI> Hou&s;e) He ro&s;e from his Chair, and went to the Door; and finding &s;ome Per&s;ons in the next Room, he bad them to withdraw; and locking both the Door of that Room, and of his Study, he &s;at down him&s;elf, and making M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;it down too, he begun <Q>&startq;&endq;with giving him many thanks for his friend&s;hip to him, which, he &s;aid, he had ever e&s;teem'd, and he could not more manife&s;t the e&s;teem he had of It and Him, than by u&s;ing that freedom again with him, which he meant to do. Then he lamented his own condition; and that he had been prefer'd from the Common Pleas, where he knew both the Bu&s;ine&s;s and the Per&s;ons <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> he had to deal with, to the other high Office he now held, which obliged him to conver&s;e and tran&s;act with another &s;ort of Men, who were not known to him, and in affairs, which he under&s;tood not, and had not one Friend among them, with whom he could confer upon any doubt, which occurred to him.</Q></P>
<P>HE &s;poke then of the unhappy &s;tate and condition of the King's bu&s;i|ne&s;s; how much he had been, and was &s;till, betrayed by Per&s;ons who were about him; and with all po&s;&s;ible indignation again&s;t the proceed|ings of the Parliament; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;they would never do This, if they were not re&s;olved to do More: that he knew the King too well, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> ob&s;erved the carriage of particular Men too much, and the whole cur|rent of publick Tran&s;actions the&s;e la&s;t five or &s;ix Months, not to fore|&s;ee that it could not be long, before there would be a War between the

King and the two Hou&s;es; and of the importance, in that Sea&s;on, that the Great Seal &s;hould be with the King.</Q> Then he fell into many ex|pre&s;&s;ions of his Duty, and Affection to the King's Per&s;on, as well as to his high Degree&punc; <Q>and &startq;&endq;that no Man &s;hould be more ready, to peri&s;h with, and for his Maje&s;ty, than He would be; that the pro&s;pect he had of this nece&s;&s;ity, had made him carry him&s;elf towards that Party with &s;o much complyance, that he might be gracious with them, at lea&s;t, that they might have no Di&s;tru&s;t of him; which, he knew, many had endeavoured to infu&s;e into them; and that there had been a con&s;ulta|tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> within few days, whether, in regard he might be &s;ent for by the King, or that the Seal might be taken from him, it would not be be&s;t to appoint the Seal to be kept in &s;ome &s;uch &s;ecure place, as that there might be no danger of lo&s;ing it; and that the Keeper &s;hould allways receive it, for the execution of his Office; they having no purpo&s;e to di&s;oblige Him. And the knowledge he had of this con&s;ultation, and fear he had of the execution of it, had been the rea&s;on, why in the late debate upon the Militia, he had given his Vote in &s;uch a manner, as, he knew, would make very ill impre&s;&s;ions with the King, and ma|ny others who did not know him very well; but that, if he had not, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in that Point, &s;ubmitted to their opinion, the Seal had been taken from him that Night; whereas by this complyance in that Vote, which could only prejudice Him&s;elf, and not the King, he had gotten &s;o much into their confidence, that he &s;hould be able to pre&s;erve the Seal in his own hands, till the King required it; and then he would be as ready to attend his Maje&s;ty with it.</Q></P>
<P>M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> was very well plea&s;ed with this di&s;cour&s;e; <Q>and asked him, &startq;&endq;whether he would give him leave, when there &s;hould be a fit occa&s;ion, to a&s;&s;ure the King, that he would perform this Service, when the King &s;hould require it? He de&s;ired, "that he would do &s;o, and pa&s;s his Word <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> for the performance of it, a&s;&s;oon as his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed; and &s;o they parted.</Q></P>
<P>IT was within very few days after, that the King, exceedingly di&s;|plea&s;ed and provoked with the Keepers behaviour, &s;ent an Order to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> "to require the Seal from him; in which the King was very po&s;itive, tho' he was not re&s;olved to what hand to commit it. His Maje&s;ty wi&s;hed them (for he allways included the other Two in &s;uch references) to con&s;ider, <Q>&startq;&endq;whether he &s;hould give it to the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Banks</HI> (again&s;t whom he made &s;ome objection him&s;elf) "or into the hands of M^r <HI>Selden;</HI> and to &s;end their opinions to him.</Q> The <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Order was po&s;itive for requiring it from the pre&s;ent Officer, but they knew not who to advi&s;e for a Succe&s;&s;or. The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Banks</HI> appeared to be as much afraid, as the other; and not thought equal to that Charge, in a time of &s;o much di&s;order; tho' otherwi&s;e he was a Man of great abilities, and unblemi&s;hed integrity; they did not doubt of M^r <HI>Selden</HI>'s Affection to the King, but withal they knew him &s;o well, that they concluded he would ab&s;olutely refu&s;e the place, if it were of|fer'd to him. He was in years, and of a tender con&s;titution; he had for many years enjoyed his ea&s;e, which he loved; was rich; and would not have made a Journey to <HI>York,</HI> or have layn out of his own bed, for <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> any Preferment; which he had never affected.</P>
<P>BEING all Three of one mind, that it would not be fit to offer it to the one or the other; hereupon M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> told them the conference he had with the Keeper, and the profe&s;&s;ions he had made; and was very
<PB N="$$" REF="4640">
confident, that he would very punctually perform it; and therefore pro|po&s;ed, <Q>that &startq;&endq;they might, with their Opinions of the other Per&s;ons, like+wi&s;e advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to &s;u&s;pend his re&s;olution concerning the Lord Keeper, and rather to write kindly to him, to bring the Seal to his Maje&s;ty,</Q> in&s;tead of &s;ending for the Seal it &s;elf, and ca&s;t him off; and offer'd to venture his own credit with the King, that the Keeper would comply with his Maje&s;ty's commands. Neither of them were of his opinion; and had both no e&s;teem of the Keeper, nor believed, that he would go to his Maje&s;ty, if he were &s;ent for, but that he would find &s;ome trick to excu&s;e him&s;elf; and therefore were not willing, that M^r <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;hould venture his Reputation upon it. <Q>He de&s;ired them then &startq;&endq;to con&s;ider how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it was, that the King &s;hould fir&s;t re&s;olve into what hand to put the Seal, before he removed it; for that it could not be unimployed one hour, but that the whole Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom would be out of order, and draw a greater and a ju&s;ter cla|mour, than had been yet: That there was as much care to be taken, that it &s;hould not be in the power of any man to refu&s;e it; which would be yet more prejudicial to his Maje&s;ty. He de&s;ired them above all, to weigh well, that the bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted only in having the Great Seal in the place, where his Maje&s;ty re&s;olved to be; and if the Keeper <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> would keep his promi&s;e, and de&s;ired to &s;erve the King, it would be un|que&s;tionably the be&s;t way, that He and the Seal were both there: if, on the other &s;ide, he were not an hone&s;t Man, and cared not for offend|ing the King, he would then refu&s;e to deliver it; and inform the Lords of it: who would ju&s;tify him for his di&s;obedience, and reward and cheri&s;h him; and he mu&s;t then hereafter &s;erve Their turn; the mi&s;|chief whereof would be greater, than could be ea&s;ily imagined: and his Maje&s;ty's own Great Seal &s;hould be every day u&s;ed again&s;t him, nor would it be po&s;&s;ible in many Months to procure a New one to be made.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>THESE objections appear'd of weight to them; and they re&s;olved to give an account of the whole to the King, and to expect his Order: and both the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> writ to his Naje&s;ty, and &s;ent their Letters away that very Night. The King was &s;atisfy'd with the Rea&s;ons, and was very glad that M^r <HI>Hyde</HI> was &s;o confident of the Keeper; tho', he &s;aid, "he remain'd &s;till in doubt; and re&s;olved that he would, &s;uch a day of the Week following, &s;end for the Keeper and the Seal; and that it &s;hould be, as had been advi&s;ed, upon a <HI>Saturday</HI> afternoon, a&s;&s;oon as the Hou&s;e of Lords &s;hould ri&s;e; becau&s;e then no notice could be taken of it till <HI>Monday.</HI> M^r <HI>Hyde,</HI> who had continued to &s;ee the Keeper fre|quently, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and was confirm'd in his confidence of his integrity, went now to him; and finding him firm to his re&s;olution, and of opinion, in regard of the high proceedings of the Hou&s;es, that it &s;hould not be long defer'd; he told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he might expect a Me&s;&s;enger the next Week, and that he &s;hould once more &s;ee him, when he would tell him the Day; and that he would then go him&s;elf away before him to <HI>York;</HI></Q> with which he was much plea&s;ed, and it was agree'd between the Three, that it was now time, that he &s;hould be gone (the King having &s;ent for him &s;ome time before) after a day or two; in which time the Declaration of the nineteenth of <HI>May</HI> would be pa&s;&s;ed. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>ON the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, between two and three of the Clock in the Afternoon, M^r <HI>Elliot,</HI> a Groom of the Bed Chamber to the Prince, came to the Keeper, and found him alone in the Room where he u&s;ed to
<PB N="447" REF="4650">
&s;it, and deliver'd him a Letter from the King in his own hand; wherein he required him, with many expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s and e&s;teem, <Q>&startq;&endq;to make ha&s;t to him; and if his indi&s;po&s;ition (for he was often troubled with gravel and &s;harpne&s;s of Urine) would not &s;uffer him to make &s;uch ha&s;t upon the Journey, as the occa&s;ion required, that he &s;hould deliver the Seal to the Per&s;on, who gave him the Letter; who, being a &s;trong young Man, would make &s;uch ha&s;t as was nece&s;&s;ary; and that he might make his own Journey,</Q> by tho&s;e degrees which his Health required. The Keeper was &s;urpri&s;ed with the Me&s;&s;enger, whom he did not like; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and more when he found that he knew the contents of the Letter, which, he hoped, would not have been communicated to any Man, who &s;hould be &s;ent: He An&s;wer'd him with much re&s;ervation, and when the other with bluntne&s;s, as he was no polite Man, demanded the Seal of him, which he had not thought of putting out of his own hands; he An&s;wer'd him, "that he would not deliver it into any hands, but the King's; but pre&s;ently recollecting him&s;elf, and looking over his Letter again, he quickly con&s;ider'd, that it would be hazardous to carry the Seal him&s;elf &s;uch a Journey; and that if by any pur&s;uit of him, which he could not but &s;u&s;pect, he &s;hould be &s;ei&s;ed upon, the King would be very unhap|pily <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> di&s;appointed of the Seal, which he had rea&s;on &s;o much to depend upon; and that his misfortune would be wholely imputed to his own fault and infidelity (which without doubt he abhorred with his heart) and the only way to prevent that mi&s;chief, or to appear innocent under it, was to deliver the Seal to the Per&s;on tru&s;ted by the King him&s;elf to receive it; and &s;o, without telling him any thing of his own purpo&s;e, he delivered the Seal into his hands; who forthwith put him&s;elf on his hor&s;e, and with wonderful expedition pre&s;ented the Great Seal into his Maje&s;ty's own hands, who was infinitely plea&s;ed with It, and with the Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> THE Keeper, that Evening, pretended to be indi&s;po&s;ed, and that he would take his re&s;t early, and therefore that no body &s;hould be ad|mitted to &s;peak with him: and then he called Serjeant <HI>Lee</HI> to him, who was the Serjeant who waited upon the Seal, and in whom he had great confidence, as he well might; and told him freely, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he was re&s;olved, the next morning, to go to the King, who had &s;ent for him; that he knew well, how much malice he &s;hould contract by it from the Parliament, which would u&s;e all the means they could to appre|hend him; and he him&s;elf knew not how he &s;hould perform the Jour|ney, therefore he put him&s;elf entirely into his hands; that he &s;hould <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> cau&s;e his Hor&s;es to be ready again&s;t the next morning, and only his own Groom to attend them, and he to guide the be&s;t way, and that he would not impart it to any other Per&s;on.</Q> The hone&s;t Serjeant was very glad of the re&s;olution, and chearfully undertook all things for the Journey; and &s;o &s;ending the Hor&s;es out of the Town, the Keeper put him&s;elf in his Coach very early the next morning, and a&s;$oon as they were out of the Town, He and the Serjeant, and one Groom, took their Hor&s;es, and made &s;o great a journey that day, it being about the be|ginning of <HI>June,</HI> that before the end of the third day, he ki&s;&s;ed the King's hand at <HI>York.</HI></P>

But on <HI>Monday</HI> morning, when it was known when, and in what manner he had left his Hou&s;e, the con|fu&s;ion in both Hou&s;es was very great; and they who had thought that their intere&s;t was &s;o great in him, that they knew all his thoughts, and had valued them&s;elves, and were valued by others, upon that account, hung down their heads, and were even di&s;tracted with &s;hame: How|ever they could not but conclude, that he was out of their reach before <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the Lords met; yet to &s;hew their indignation again&s;t him, and it may be in hope that his infirmities would detain him long in the Journey (as no body indeed thought that he could have perform'd it, with that ex|pedition) they i&s;&s;ued out &s;uch a Warrant for the apprehending him, as had been in the ca&s;e of the foule&s;t Felon or Murtherer; and printed it, and cau&s;ed it to be di&s;per&s;ed, by Expre&s;&s;es, over all the Kingdom with great ha&s;t. All which circum&s;tances both before, and after the Keepers Journey to <HI>York,</HI> are the more particularly, and at large &s;et down, out of ju&s;tice to the Memory of that noble Per&s;on; who&s;e Honour &s;uffer'd then much in the opinion of many, by the confident report of the per|&s;on, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> who was &s;ent for, and received the Seal, and who was a loud and bold Talker, and de&s;ired to have it believed, that his manhood had ra|vi&s;hed the Great Seal from the Keeper, even in &s;pight of his teeth; which, how impo&s;&s;ible &s;oever in it &s;elf, found too much credit; and is therefore cleared by this very true, and punctual Relation, which in truth is but due to him.</P>
<P>BUT the trouble and di&s;traction, which at this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, was vi&s;ibly very great; and their dejection &s;uch, that the &s;ame day the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> (who had been of another temper) moved, <Q>&startq;&endq;that a Committee might be appointed, to con&s;ider how there might be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> an Accommodation between the King and his People, for the Good, Happine&s;s, and Safety of both King and Kingdom;</Q> which Committee was appointed accordingly.</P>
<P>THIS temper of Accommodation troubled them not long, new warmth and vigour being quickly infu&s;ed into them by the unbroken, and undaunted Spirits of the Hou&s;e of Commons; which, to &s;hew how little they valued the power or Authority of the King, tho&punc; &s;upported by having now his Great Seal by him, on the 26^t^h of <HI>May</HI> agreed on a new Remon&s;trance to the People; in which, the Lords concurring, they informed them, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FIRST they were charged for the avowing that Act of S^r <HI>John Hotham;</HI> which was termed unparallel'd, and an high, and unheard of affront unto his Maje&s;ty, and as if they needed not to have done it; he being able, as was alledg'd, to produce no &s;uch Command of the Hou&s;es of Parliament.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE next Charge upon them was, that in&s;tead of giving his Ma|je&s;ty &s;atisfaction, they publi&s;hed a Declaration concerning that bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as an Appeal to the People, and as if their intercour&s;e with his Maje&s;ty, and for his &s;atisfaction, were now to no more purpo&s;e; which cour&s;e was alledg'd to be very unagreeable to the Mode&s;ty and Duty of former times, and not warrantable by any Precedents, but what Them&s;elves had made. They &s;aid, if the Penner of that Me&s;&s;age had expected awhile, or had not expected that two Hou&s;es of Parliament <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &punc;e&s;pecially burthen'd, as they were at that time, with &s;o many pre&s;|&s;ing and urgent affairs) &s;hould have moved as fa&s;t as him&s;elf, he would not have &s;aid, that Declaration was in&s;tead of an An&s;wer to his Ma|je&s;ty; which they did di&s;patch with all the &s;peed, and diligence they could, and had &s;ent it to his Maje&s;ty by a Committee of both Hou&s;es; whereby it appeared, that they did it not upon that ground, that they thought it was no more to any purpo&s;e, to endeavour to give his Ma|je&s;ty &s;atisfaction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND as for the Duty and Mode&s;ty of former times, from which they were &s;aid to have varied, and to want the Warrant of any Prece|dents <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> therein, but what Them&s;elves had made: If they had made any Precedents this Parliament, they had made them for Po&s;terity, upon the &s;ame, or better grounds of Rea&s;on and Law, than tho&s;e were upon, which their Predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t made for Them: And as &s;ome Precedents ought not to be rules for them to follow, &s;o none could be limits to bound their proceedings: which might, and mu&s;t vary, according to the different condition of Times. And for that Particular, of &s;etting forth Declarations for the &s;atisfaction of the People, who had cho&s;en, and entru&s;ted them with all that was deare&s;t to them: If there were no example for it, it was becau&s;e there were never any Mon&s;ters be|fore, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that ever attempted to di&s;affect the People from a Parliament, or could ever harbour a thought that it might be effected. Were there ever &s;uch practices to poy&s;on the People with an ill apprehen&s;ion of the Parliament? Were there ever &s;uch imputations and &s;candals laid upon the Proceedings of both Hou&s;es? Were there ever &s;o many, and &s;o great breaches of Priviledge of Parliament? Were there ever &s;o many, and &s;o de&s;perate de&s;igns of force and violence again&s;t the Parlia|ment, and the Members thereof? If they had Done more, than ever their Ance&s;tors had Done, they &s;aid, they had Suffered more, than ever They had Suffered; and yet, in point of Mode&s;ty and Duty, they <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> would not yield to the be&s;t of former times; and they would put that in i&s;&s;ue, whether the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t unwarrantable Precedents of any of his Maje&s;ty's Predece&s;&s;ors, did not fall &s;hort, and much below, what had been done to them this Parliament? And on the other &s;ide, whether, if they &s;hould make the highe&s;t Precedents of other Parlia|ments their Patterns, there would be cau&s;e to complain of want of mode&s;ty, and duty in Them; when they had not &s;o much as &s;uffered &s;uch things to enter into their Thoughts, which all the world knew They put in Act?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;ANOTHER Charge which was laid very high upon them, and which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> were indeed a very great Crime if they were found guilty thereof, was, that by avowing that Act of S^r <HI>John Hotham,</HI> they did, in con&s;equence, confound and de&s;troy the title, and intere&s;t of all his Maje&s;ty's good
<PB N="451" REF="4690">
Subjects to their Lands and Goods; and that, upon this ground; that his Maje&s;ty had the &s;ame Title to his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> which any of his Subjects had to their Hou&s;es or Lands, and the &s;ame to his Magazine and Munition there, that any Man had to his Money, Plate, or Jewels: And therefore, that they ought not to have been di&s;po&s;ed of, without, or again&s;t his Con&s;ent, no more than the Hou&s;e, Land, Money, Plate, or Jewels of any Subject ought to be, without, or again&s;t his Will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HERE, they &s;aid, that was laid down for a Principle, which would indeed pull up the very foundation of the liberty, property, and in|tere&s;t of every Subject in particular, and of all the Subjects in general, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> if they &s;hould admit it for a truth, that his Maje&s;ty had the &s;ame right and title to his Towns, and to his Magazines (bought with the publick Moneys, as they conceived that at <HI>Hull</HI> to have been) that every particular Man hath to his Hou&s;e, Lands, and Goods. For his Ma|je&s;ty's Towns were no more his own, than his Kingdom was his own; and his Kingdom was no more his own, than his People are his own; and if the King had a property in all his Towns, what would become of the Subjects propriety in their Hou&s;es therein? and if He had a pro|priety in his Kingdom, what would become of the Subjects property in their Lands throughout the Kingdom? or of their Liberties, ifhis <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Maje&s;ty had the &s;ame right in their Per&s;ons, that every Subject hath in his Lands, and Goods? and what would become of all the Subjects intere&s;ts in the Towns, and Forts of the Kingdom, and in the King|dom it &s;elf, if his Maje&s;ty might &s;ell, or give them away, or di&s;po&s;e of them at his plea&s;ure, as a particular Man might do with his Lands, and with his Goods? This erroneous Maxim being infu&s;ed into Princes, that their Kingdoms are their own, and that they may do with them what they will, as if their Kingdoms were for Them, and not They for their Kingdoms, was, they &s;aid, the Root of all the Subjects mi&s;ery, and of the invading of their ju&s;t Rights, and Liberties; whereas, in|deed, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> they are only entru&s;ted with their Kingdoms, and with their Towns, and with their People, and with the publick Trea&s;ure of the Common-wealth, and what&s;oever is bought therewith; and, by the known Law of this Kingdom, the very Jewels of the Crown are not the King's proper Goods, but are only entru&s;ted to him, for the u&s;e and ornament thereof: As the Towns, Forts, Trea&s;ure, Magazines, Offices, and the People of the Kingdom, and the whole Kingdom it &s;elf is en|tru&s;ted unto him, for the good, and &s;afety, and be&s;t advantage thereof: and as this Tru&s;t is for the u&s;e of the Kingdom, &s;o ought it to be ma|naged by the advice of the Hou&s;es of Parliament, whom the Kingdom <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> hath tru&s;ted for that purpo&s;e; it being their duty to &s;ee it di&s;charged according to the condition and true intent thereof; and as much as in them lies, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to prevent the contrary; which, if it had been their chief care, and only aime, in the di&s;po&s;ing of the Town and Magazine of <HI>Hull</HI> in &s;uch manner as they had done, they hoped it would appear clearly to all the world, that they had di&s;charged their own Tru&s;t, and not invaded that of his Maje&s;ty, much le&s;s his Pro|perty; which in that ca&s;e, they could not do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT admitting his Maje&s;ty had indeed a Property in the Town and Magazine of <HI>Hull;</HI> who doubted but that a Parliament may di&s;po&s;e <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of any thing, wherein his Maje&s;ty, or any Subject hath a right, in &s;uch a way, as that the Kingdom may not be expo&s;ed to Hazard, or Danger thereby? Which was Their ca&s;e, in the di&s;po&s;ing of the Town and
<PB N="452" REF="4700">
Magazine of <HI>Hull.</HI> And whereas his Maje&s;ty did allow this, and a greater power to a Parliament, but in that &s;en&s;e only, as he him&s;elf was a Part thereof; they appeal'd to every man&punc;s con&s;cience, that had ob&s;erved their proceedings, whether they disjoyn'd his Maje&s;ty from his Parliament, who had in all humble ways &s;ought his concurrence with them, as in that particular about <HI>Hull,</HI> and for the removal of the Magazine there, &s;o al&s;o in all other things; or whether tho&s;e evil Coun&s;els about him, had not &s;eparated him from his Parliament; not only in di&s;tance of place, but al&s;o in the di&s;charge of the joint Tru&s;t with them, for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom in that, and &s;ome <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> other Particulars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY had given no occa&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty, they &s;aid, to declare with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s his re&s;olution, that he would not &s;uffer ei|ther, or both Hou&s;es by their Votes, without, or again&s;t his Con&s;ent, to enjoyn any thing that was forbidden by the Law, or to forbid any thing that was enjoyn'd by the Law: for their Votes had done no &s;uch thing: And as they &s;hould be very tender of the Law (which they did acknowledge to be the &s;afeguard, and cu&s;tody of all publick and private Intere&s;ts) &s;o they would never allow a few private Per&s;ons about the King, nor his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf in his own Per&s;on, and out of his Courts, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to be judge of the Law, and that contrary to the judgment of the highe&s;t Court of Judicature. In like manner, that his Maje&s;ty had not refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to any thing, that might be for the Peace and Happine&s;s of the Kingdom, they could not admit it in any other &s;en&s;e, but as his Maje&s;ty taketh the mea&s;ure of what will be for the Peace and Happi|ne&s;s of his Kingdom, from &s;ome few ill affected Per&s;ons about him, contrary to the Advice, and Judgment of his great Council of Parlia|ment. And becau&s;e the Advice of both Hou&s;es of Parliament had, through the &s;ugge&s;tion of evil Coun&s;ellors, been &s;o much undervalued of late, and &s;o ab&s;olutely rejected and refu&s;ed, they &s;aid, they held it <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> fit to declare unto the Kingdom, who&s;e Honour and Intere&s;t was &s;o much concern'd in it, what was the Priviledge of the Great Council of Parliament herein; and what was the Obligation that lay upon the Kings of this Realm, to pa&s;s &s;uch Bills, as are offer'd to them by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, in the Name, and for the Good of the whole Kingdom, whereunto they &s;tand engaged both in con&s;cience, and ju&s;tice, to give their Royal A&s;&s;ent: In Con&s;cience, in regard of the Oath, that is, or ought to be taken by the Kings of this Realm at their Corona|tion, as well to confirm by their Royal A&s;&s;ent &s;uch good Laws, as the People &s;hall choo&s;e, and to remedy by Law &s;uch inconveniences, as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the Kingdom may &s;uffer; as to keep, and protect the Laws allready in being; as may appear both by the Form of the Oath upon Record, and in Books of good Authority, and by the Statute of the 25 of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the III. entituled, the Statute of Provi&s;ors of Benefices; the Form of which Oath, and the Clau&s;e of the Statute that concerneth it, are as followeth:</Q></P>

<P>WHEREUPON the &s;aid Commons have prayed our &s;aid Lord the King; That &s;ith the Right of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the Law of the &s;aid Realm is &s;uch, that upon the mi&s;chiefs and damages, which happen to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> this Realm, he ought, and is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his People in his Parliament, thereof to make Remedy and Law, and in re|moving the mi&s;chiefs, and damages which thereof en$ue, that it may plea&s;e him thereupon to ordain Remedy.</P>
<P>OUR Lord the King &s;eeing the mi&s;chiefs and damages before men|tion'd, and having regard to the Statute made in the time of his &s;aid Grandfather, and to the Cau&s;es contained in the &s;ame, which Statute holdeth allways his force, and was never defeated, repealed, or annulled in any point, and by &s;o much he is bound by his Oath to cau&s;e the &s;ame to be kept as the Law of his Realm, tho' that, by &s;ufferance and negli|gence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> it hath been &s;ithence attempted to the contrary: Al&s;o having re|gard to the grievous complaints made to him by his People, in divers his Parliaments holden heretofore, willing to ordain remedy for the great damages, and mi&s;chiefs which have happen'd, and daily do happen, to the Church of <HI>England</HI> by the &s;aid Cau&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HERE, they &s;aid, the Lords, and Commons claim it directly as the Right of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Law of the Land, and that the King is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his People in Par|liament, to make remedy, and Law, upon the mi&s;chiefs and damages, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> which happen to this Realm; and the King doth not deny it, altho' he take occa&s;ion from a Statute formerly made by his Grandfather, which was laid as part of the grounds of this Petition, to fix his An|&s;wer upon another branch of his Oath, and pretermits that which is claimed by the Lords and Commons; which he would not have done, if it might have been excepted again&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IN Ju&s;tice, they &s;aid, they are obliged thereunto, in re&s;pect of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; which is as well to pre&s;erve the Kingdom by the making new Laws, where there &s;hall be need, as by ob&s;erving of Laws allready made; a Kingdom being, many times, as much expo&s;ed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> to ruin, for the want of a new Law, as by the violation of tho&s;e that are in being: and this is &s;o clear a Right, that, no doubt, his Maje&s;ty would acknowledge it to be as due to his People, as his Protection. But how far forth he was obliged to follow the judgment of his Parlia|ment
<PB N="454" REF="4720">
therein, that is the Que&s;tion. And certainly, be&s;ides the words in the King's Oath, referring unto &s;uch Laws as the People &s;hall choo&s;e, as in &s;uch things which concern the publick Weal and Good of the Kingdom, They are the mo&s;t proper judges, who are &s;ent from the whole Kingdom for that very purpo&s;e; &s;o they did not find, that &s;ince Laws have pa&s;&s;ed by way of Bills (which are read thrice in both Hou&s;es, and Committed; and every part, and circum&s;tance of them fully weighed, and debated upon the Commitment, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed in both Hou&s;es) that ever the Kings of this Realm did deny them, otherwi&s;e than is expre&s;&s;ed in that u&s;ual An&s;wer, <HI>Le Roy S&punc;avi&s;era;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> which &s;ignifies rather a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, than a refu&s;al of the Royal A&s;&s;ent. And in tho&s;e other Laws, which are framed by way of Petitions of Right, the Hou&s;es of Parliament have taken them&s;elves to be &s;o far Judges of the Right claimed by them, that when the King's An&s;wer hath not, in every point, been fully according to their de&s;ires&punc; they have &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon their claim, and never re&s;ted &s;atisfy'd, till &s;uch time as they had an An&s;wer according to their demand; as had been done in the late Petition of Right, and in former times upon the like occa&s;ion. And if the Parliament be judge between the King and his People in the que&s;tion of Right (as by the manner in the claime in <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Petitions of Right, and by judgments in Parliament, in ca&s;es of illegal impo&s;itions and taxes, and the like, it appears to be) why &s;hould they not be &s;o al&s;o, in the que&s;tion of the Common Good, and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Kingdom; wherein the Kingdom hath as clear a Right al&s;o to have the benefit, and remedy of Law, as in any thing what&s;oever? And yet they did not deny, but that in private Bills, and al&s;o in publick Acts of Grace, as Pardons, and the like Grants of Favour, his Maje&s;ty might have a greater latitude of Granting, or Denying, as he &s;hould think fit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;All this con&s;ider'd, they &s;aid, they could not but wonder, that the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Contriver of that Me&s;&s;age &s;hould conceive, the People of this Land to be &s;o void of Common &s;en&s;e, as to enter into &s;o deep a mi&s;tru&s;t of tho&s;e, whom they have, and his Maje&s;ty ought to repo&s;e &s;o great a Tru&s;t in, as to de&s;pair of any &s;ecurity in their private E&s;tates, by De&s;cents, Pur|cha&s;es, A&s;&s;urances, or Conveyances; unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty &s;hould, by His Vote, prevent the prejudice, they might receive therein by the Votes of both Hou&s;es of Parliament; as if They, who are e&s;pecially cho&s;en, and entru&s;ted for that purpo&s;e, and who Them&s;elves mu&s;t needs have &s;o great a &s;hare in all Grievances of the Subject, had wholely ca&s;t off all care of the Subjects Good, and his Maje&s;ty had &s;olely taken it up; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and as if it could be imagined, that They &s;hould, by their Votes, over|throw the Rights of De&s;cents, Purcha&s;es, or of any Conveyance or A&s;&s;urance, in who&s;e judgment the whole Kingdom hath placed all their particular intere&s;ts, if any of them &s;hould be called in que&s;tion, in any of tho&s;e ca&s;es; and that (as not knowing where to place them, with greater &s;ecurity) without any Appeal from Them to any other Per&s;on, or Court what&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT indeed they were very much to &s;eek, how the Ca&s;e of <HI>Hull</HI> could concern De&s;cents and Purcha&s;es, or Conveyances and A&s;&s;urances; unle&s;s it were in procuring more &s;ecurity to Men in their Private in|tere&s;ts, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> by the pre&s;ervation of the Whole from confu&s;ion, and de|&s;truction; and much le&s;s did they under&s;tand, how the Soveraign Power was re&s;i&s;ted, and de&s;pi&s;ed therein. Certainly no command from his
<PB N="455" REF="4730">
Maje&s;ty, and his high Court of Parliament (where the Soveraign Power re&s;ides) was di&s;obeyed by S^r <HI>John Hotham;</HI> nor yet was his Maje&s;ty's Authority derived out of any other Court, nor by any legal Commi&s;|&s;ion, or by any other way, wherein the Law had appointed his Ma|je&s;ty's commands to be derived to be derived to his Subjects; and of what validity his Verbal Commands are, without any &s;uch Stamp of his Authority upon them, and again&s;t the Order of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and whether the not &s;ubmitting thereunto, be a re&s;i&s;ting and de&s;pi&s;ing of the Soveraign Authority, they would leave to all Men to judge, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> do at all under&s;tand the Government of this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY acknowledged that his Maje&s;ty had made many expre&s;&s;ions of his Zeal, and Intentions again&s;t the de&s;perate de&s;igns of the Papi&s;ts; but yet it was al&s;o as true, that the Coun&s;els, which had prevailed of late with him, had been little &s;uitable to tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, and In|tentions. For what did more advance the open, and bloo ly de&s;ign of the Papi&s;ts in <HI>Ireland</HI> (whereon the &s;ecret Plots of the Papi&s;ts here did, in all likelyhood, depend) than his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;enting him&s;elf, in that manner that he did, from his Parliament; and &s;etting forth &s;uch &s;harp Invectives again&s;t them, notwith&s;tanding all the humble Peti|tions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and other means, which his Parliament had addre&s;&s;ed unto him, for his return, and for his &s;atisfaction concerning their proceedings? And what was more likely to give a ri&s;e to the de&s;igns of the Papi&s;ts (whereof there &s;o many in the North, near to the Town of <HI>Hull)</HI> and of other malignant, and ill affected Per&s;ons (which were ready to joyn with them) or to the attempts of Forreigners from abroad, than the continuing of that great Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> at this time, and con|trary to the de&s;ire and advice of both Hou&s;es of Parliament? So that they had too much cau&s;e to believe, that the Papi&s;ts had &s;till &s;ome way and means, whereby they had influence upon his Maje&s;ty's Coun&s;els <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> for their own advantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR the Malignant Party, they &s;aid, his Maje&s;ty needed not a de|&s;inition of the Law, nor yet a more full Character of them from both Hou&s;es of Parliament, for to find them out, if he would plea&s;e only to apply the Character, that Him&s;elf had made of them, to tho&s;e, unto whom it doth properly and truly belong. Who are &s;o much di&s;af|fected to the Peace of the Kingdom, as they that endeavour to di&s;affect his Maje&s;ty from the Hou&s;es of Parliament, and per&s;wade him to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance from them, both in place and affection? Who are more di&s;affected to the Government of the Kingdom, than &s;uch as lead <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> his Maje&s;ty away from hearkning to his Parliament; which, by the con|&s;titution of the Kingdom, is his greate&s;t and be&s;t Council; and per&s;wade him to follow the malicious Coun&s;els of &s;ome private Men, in oppo&s;ing and contradicting the whole&s;ome advices, and ju&s;t proceedings of that his mo&s;t faithful Council, and highe&s;t Court? Who are they, that not only neglect and de&s;pi&s;e, but labour to undermine the Law under co|lour of maintaining it, but they that endeavour to de&s;troy the Foun|tain, and Con&s;ervatory of the Law, which is the Parliament? And Who are they that &s;et up other Rules for them&s;elves to walk by, than &s;uch as were according to Law, but they that will make other Judges <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the Law than the Law hath appointed; and &s;o di&s;pence with their obedience to that, which the Law calleth Authority, and to Their de|terminations and re&s;olutions, to whom the judgment doth appertain by Law? For, when private Per&s;ons &s;hall make the Law to be their
<PB N="456" REF="4740">
Rule according to their own under&s;tanding, contrary to the judgment of tho&s;e, that are the competent judges thereof, they &s;et up unto them|&s;elves other Rules than the Law doth acknowledge.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IN the &s;tating of that Ca&s;e, they &s;aid, divers Particulars might be ob&s;erved, wherein it was not rightly &s;tated: As,</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT his Maje&s;ty's going to <HI>Hull,</HI> was only an endeavour to Vi&s;it a Town, and Fort of his: whereas it was indeed to Po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of the Town, and Magazine there, and to di&s;po&s;e of them, as he him&s;elf &s;hould think good, without, and contrary to the Advice, and Orders of both Hou&s;es of Parliament; as did clearly appear by his Maje&s;ty's own Declaration of his Intentions therein, by his Me&s;&s;ages to both Hou&s;es, immediately before, and after that Journey. Nor could they believe, that any Man, who &s;hould con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> that Journey to <HI>Hull,</HI> could think, that his Maje&s;ty would have gone thither at that time, and in that po&s;ture, that he was plea&s;ed to put him&s;elf in towards the Parliament, if he had intended only a Vi&s;it of the Town and Magazine.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="459" REF="4770">
2. IT was &s;aid to be his Maje&s;ty's own Town, and his own Magazine, <Q>&startq;&endq;which being under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e, as was before expre&s;&s;ed, as if his Maje&s;ty had a private Intere&s;t of Propriety therein, they could not admit it to be &s;o.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>&startq;&endq;WHICH was the main Point of all, S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> was &s;aid to have &s;hut the Gates again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and to have made re&s;i&s;tance with Armed Men, in defiance of his Maje&s;ty; whereas it was indeed in obedience to his Maje&s;ty, and his Authority, and for His Service, and the Service of the Kingdom; for which u&s;e only, all that Intere&s;t <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> is, that the King hath in the Town; and it is no further his to di&s;po&s;e of, than he u&s;eth it for that end: and S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> being com|manded to keep the Town and Magazine, for his Maje&s;ty and the King|dom, and not to deliver them up, but by his Maje&s;ty's Authority &s;igni|fied by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, all that was to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, of his denying, and oppo&s;ing his Maje&s;ty's entrance, and telling him in plain terms, that he &s;hould not come in, was only this, that he humbly de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to forbear his entrance, till he might acquaint the Parliament; and that his Authority might come &s;ignified to him by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, according to the Tru&s;t <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> repo&s;ed in him. And certainly, if the Letter of the Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. <HI>ch.</HI> 2. be thought to import this, That no War can be le|vied again&s;t the King, but what is directed, and intended again&s;t his Per&s;on, or that every levying of Forces for the defence of the King's Authority, and of his Kingdom, again&s;t the Per&s;onal Commands of the King oppo&s;ed thereunto, tho' accompanied with his Pre&s;ence, is levying War again&s;t the King, it is very far from the Sen&s;e of that Sta|tute; and &s;o much the Statute it &s;elf &s;peaks (be&s;ides the Authority of Book Ca&s;es; Precedents of divers Traytors condemn'd upon that inter|pretation thereof) For if the Clau&s;e of levying of War had been meant <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> only again&s;t the King's Per&s;on, what need had there been thereof after the other branch of Trea&s;on, in the &s;ame Statute, of compa&s;&s;ing the King's Death, which would nece&s;&s;arily have implied this? And becau&s;e the former Clau&s;e doth imply this, it &s;eems not at all to be intended in this latter branch; but only the levying of War again&s;t the King, that is, again&s;t his Laws and Authority: And the levying of War again&s;t his Laws and Authority, tho' not again&s;t his Per&s;on, is levying War again&s;t the King; but the levying of Force again&s;t his Per&s;onal Com|mands, tho' accompanied with his Pre&s;ence, and not again&s;t his Laws and Authority, but in the maintenance thereof, is no levying of War <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> again&s;t the King, but for him.</Q></P>

their Limits, and the Safety of the Land for their Ends, &s;o they doubted not but all per&s;ons mention'd in that Order, and all his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects, would yield obedience to his Maje&s;ty's Authority, &s;ignified therein by both Hou&s;es of Parliament. And that all Men might the better know their duty in matters of that nature, and upon how &s;ure a ground They go, that follow the judgment of Parliament for their Guide, they wi&s;hed them judiciou&s;ly to con&s;ider the true meaning, and ground of that Statute made in the eleventh Year of King <HI>H.</HI> VII. <HI>ch.</HI> I. which was printed at large in the end of his Maje&s;ty's Me&s;&s;age of the fourth of <HI>May:</HI> That Statute provides, that none who &s;hall attend <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> upon the King and do him true Service, &s;hould be attainted, or for|feit any thing. What was the Scope of that Statute? To provide that Men &s;hould not &s;uffer as Traytors, for &s;erving the King in his Wars according to the duty of their Allegiance? If this had been all, it had been a very needle&s;s, and ridiculous Statute. Was it then intended (as They &s;eem'd to take the meaning of it to be, that cau&s;ed it to be printed after his Maje&s;ty's Me&s;&s;age) that They &s;hould be free from all Crime and Penalty, that &s;hould follow the King, and &s;erve him in War in any ca&s;e what&s;oever; whether it were for, or again&s;t the King|dom, and the Laws thereof? That could not be; for that could not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;tand with the duty of their Allegiance; which, in the beginning of the Statute, was expre&s;&s;ed to be to &s;erve the King for the time being in his Wars, for the defence of Him, and the Land; and therefore if it be again&s;t the Land (as it cannot be under&s;tood to be otherwi&s;e, if it be again&s;t the Parliament, the Repre&s;entative body of the Kingdom) it is a declining from the duty of Allegiance; which this Statute &s;up|po&s;eth may be done, tho' Men &s;hould follow the King's Per&s;on in the War: Otherwi&s;e there had been no need of &s;uch a Provi&s;o in the end of the Statute, that none &s;hould take the benefit thereby, that &s;hould decline from their Allegiance. That therefore which is the principal <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Verb in this Statute is, The &s;erving of the King for the time being; which could not be meant of <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> or any that &s;hould call him&s;elf King; but &s;uch a One, as whatever his Titlemight prove, ei|ther in Him&s;elf, or in his Ance&s;tors, &s;hould be received, and acknow|ledged for &s;uch by the Kingdom; the Con&s;ent whereof cannot be di&s;|cern'd but by Parliament; the Act whereof is the Act of the whole Kingdom, by the Per&s;onal Suffrage of the Peers, and the delegate Con|&s;ent of all the Commons of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>

<P>THIS Declaration wrought more upon the minds of Men, than all they had done? for the bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Hull</HI> was, by very many, thought to be done before projected; and the Argument of the Militia to be en|ter'd upon at fir&s;t in pa&s;&s;ion, and afterwards pur&s;ued with that vehe|mence, in&s;en&s;ibly, by being engaged; and that both extravagances had &s;o much weighed down the King's Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, in coming to the Hou&s;e and accu&s;ing the Members, that a rea&s;onable agreement would have been the &s;ooner con&s;ented to on all hands. But when, by this Declaration, they &s;aw Foundations laid, upon which not only what had been all|ready <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> done, would be well ju&s;tified, but what&s;oever they &s;hould, here|after, find convenient to &s;econd what was allready done; and that not only the King, but the Regal Power was either &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or depo&s;ited in other hands; the irregularity, and mon&s;trou&s;ne&s;s of which Principles found little oppo&s;ition or re&s;i&s;tance, even for the Irregularity, and Mon|&s;trou&s;ne&s;s: Very many thought it as un&s;afe to be pre&s;ent at tho&s;e Con|&s;ultations, as to con&s;ent to the Conclu&s;ions; and &s;o great Numbers of the Members of both Hou&s;es, ab&s;enting them&s;elves; and many e&s;pecially of the Hou&s;e of Peers, re&s;orted to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>York.</HI> So that, in the De|bates of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, there was not u&s;ually pre&s;ent, in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e of Commons, the fifth part of their ju&s;t Numbers; and, very often, not above a Dozen or Thirteen, in the Hou&s;e of Peers. In the mean time the King had a full Court, and received all Comers with great clemency, and grace; calling allways all the Peers to Coun&s;el, and communicating with them all &s;uch Declarations, as he thought fit to publi&s;h in An&s;wer to tho&s;e of the Parliament; and all Me&s;&s;ages, and whatever el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to be done for the improvement of his con|dition: And, having now the Great Seal with him, i&s;&s;ued &s;uch Procla|mations, as were &s;ea&s;onable for the pre&s;ervation of the Peace of the King|dom.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IT &s;eem'd the intention of that Declaration, what&s;oever other End it had, was to An&s;wer a Declaration, they had received from his Ma|je&s;ty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> in An&s;wer to that which was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>New-Market,</HI> the ninth of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t; and likewi&s;e his An&s;wer to the Pe|tition of both Hou&s;es, pre&s;ented to him at <HI>York,</HI> the 26^t^h of <HI>March:</HI> But, before it fell upon any Particular of his Maje&s;ty's Declaration or An&s;wer, it complain'd that the Heads of the Malignant Party had, with much Art and Indu&s;try, advi&s;ed him to &s;uffer divers unju&s;t Scan|dals, and Imputations upon the Parliament, to be publi&s;hed in His Name, whereby they might make it odious to the People, and, by their help, de&s;troy it: but not in&s;tancing in any one Scandal, or Im|putation, &s;o publi&s;hed by his Maje&s;ty, he was, he &s;aid, &s;till to &s;eek for the Heads of that Malignant Party. But his good Subjects would <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> ea&s;ily under&s;tand, that if he were guilty of that a&s;per&s;ion, he mu&s;t not only be active in rai&s;ing the Scandal, but pa&s;&s;ive in the mi&s;chief be|gotten by that Scandal, his Maje&s;ty being an E&s;&s;ential part of the Par|liament; and he hoped the ju&s;t Defence of Him&s;elf and his Authority, and the nece&s;&s;ary Vindication of his Innocence and Ju&s;tice, from the imputations laid on him, by a Major part then pre&s;ent of either or both Hou&s;es, &s;hould no more be called a Scandal upon the Parliament, than the Opinion of &s;uch a part be reputed an Act of Parliament: And he hoped his good Subjects would not be long mi&s;led, by that com|mon expre&s;&s;ion in all the Declarations, wherein they u&s;urp the word <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Parliament, and apply it to countenance any Re&s;olution or Vote &s;ome few had a mind to make, by calling it the Re&s;olution of Parliament; which could never be without his Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ent; neither could the Vote of either or both Hou&s;es make a greater alteration in the Laws of the Kingdom (&s;o &s;olemnly made by the advice of their Predece&s;&s;ors, with the Concurrence of his Maje&s;ty and his Ance&s;tors) either by commanding, or inhibiting any thing (be&s;ides the known rule of the Law) than his &s;ingle Direction or Mandate could do, to which he did not a&s;cribe that Authority.</Q></P>

his Journey thither (for which he had no other rea&s;on to be &s;orry, than with reference to the Cau&s;e of it) was only forced upon him, by the true Malignant Party; which contrived and countenanced tho&s;e barbarous Tumults, and other &s;editious Circum&s;tances, of which he had &s;o often complain'd, and hereafter &s;hould &s;ay more; and which indeed threaten'd &s;o much danger to his Per&s;on, and laid &s;o much Scan|dal upon the Priviledge, and Dignity of Parliament, that he wonder'd it could be mention'd without blu&s;hes, or indignation: But of that, anon: But why the Malignant Party &s;hould be charged with the cau&s;ing a Pre&s;s to be tran&s;ported to <HI>York,</HI> his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, he could not imagine; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> neither had any Papers or Writings i&s;&s;ued from thence, to His know|ledge, but what had been extorted from him by &s;uch Provocations, as had not been before offer'd to a King.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BEFORE that Declaration vouch&s;afed to in&s;i&s;t upon any Particulars, it was plea&s;ed to cen&s;ure both his Maje&s;ty's Declaration and An&s;wer to be filled with har&s;h Cen&s;ures, and cau&s;le&s;s Charges upon the Parlia|ment (&s;till mi&s;applying the word Parliamennt to the Vote of both Hou&s;es) concerning which they re&s;olve to give &s;atisfaction to the King|dom, &s;ince they found it very difficult to &s;atisfy his Maje&s;ty.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HIS Maje&s;ty &s;aid, he had not at all &s;werved, or departed from his Re&s;olutions, or Words, in the beginning of this Parliament: He had &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to put him&s;elf freely, and clearly upon the Love and Affection of his Engli&s;h Subjects; and he &s;aid &s;o &s;till, as far as con|cerns <HI>England.</HI> And he called Allmighty God to Witne&s;s, all his Com|plaints and Jealou&s;ies, which had never been cau&s;le&s;s, nor of his Hou&s;es of Parliament (but of &s;ome few Schi&s;matical, Factious, and Ambi|tious <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Spirits; and upon grounds, as he feared, a &s;hort time would ju&s;tify to the world) his Denial of the Militia, his ab&s;enting him&s;elf from <HI>London,</HI> had been the effects of an upright, and faithful Affection to his Engli&s;h Subjects; that he might be able, through all the inconve|niences he might be compelled to wre&s;tle with, at la&s;t to pre&s;erve, and re&s;tore their Religion, Laws, and Liberties unto them.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HIS Maje&s;ty &s;aid, that when he re&s;olved, upon &s;uch grounds, as, when they &s;hould be publi&s;hed, would &s;atisfy the world, that it was fit for his own Safety, and Honour, and the Peace of the Kingdom, to proceed again&s;t tho&s;e Per&s;ons; tho' he well knew, there was no de|gree of Priviledge in that Ca&s;e, yet, to &s;hew his de&s;ire of Corre&s;pon|dence with the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, he cho&s;e rather than to ap|prehend their Per&s;ons by the ordinary Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice (which, ac|cording to the opinion, and practice of former times, he might have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> done) to command his Atturney General, to acquaint his Hou&s;e of Peers with his intention, and the general matters of his charge (which was yet more particular, than a meer accu&s;ation) and to proceed ac|cordingly; and at the &s;ame time &s;ent a &s;worn Servant, a Serjeant at Armes, to the Hou&s;e of Commons, to acquaint them, that his Maje&s;ty did accu&s;e, and intended to pro&s;ecute the five Members of that Hou&s;e for High-Trea&s;on; and did require, that their Per&s;ons might be &s;e|cured in Cu&s;tody.

an Order was made, and the &s;ame night publi&s;hed in Print, That if any Per&s;on what&s;oever, &s;hould offer to arre&s;t the Per&s;on of any Mem|ber of that Hou&s;e, without fir&s;t acquainting that Hou&s;e therewith, and receiving further Order from that Hou&s;e, that it &s;hould be Lawful for &s;uch Member, or any Per&s;on, to re&s;i&s;t them, and to &s;tand upon his, or their Guard of Defence; and to make Re&s;i&s;tance, according to the prote&s;tation taken to Defend the Priviledge of Parliament: And this was the fir&s;t time that he heard the Prote&s;tation might be wre&s;ted to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, or that in any Ca&s;e, tho' of the mo&s;t undoubted and un|que&s;tionable <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Priviledge, it might be Lawful for any Per&s;on to re&s;i&s;t, and u&s;e violence again&s;t a publick Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice, armed with Law|ful Authority; tho' his Maje&s;ty well knew, that even &s;uch a Mini&s;ter might be puni&s;hed for executing &s;uch Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;UPON Viewing that Order, his Maje&s;ty confe&s;&s;ed, he was &s;ome|what amazed, having never &s;een, or heard of the like; tho' he had known Members of either Hou&s;e committed, without &s;o much For|mality as he had u&s;ed, and upon Crimes of a far inferiour nature to tho&s;e he had &s;ugge&s;ted; and having no cour&s;e propo&s;ed him for his Proceeding, he was, upon the matter, only told, that again&s;t tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Per&s;ons he was not to proceed at all; that they were above His reach, or the reach of the Law. It was not ea&s;y for him to re&s;olve what to do: If he imployed his Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice in the u&s;ual way for their apprehen&s;ion, who without doubt would not have refu&s;ed to have executed his Lawful Commands, he &s;aw what oppo&s;ition, and re&s;i&s;tance, was like to be made; which, very probably, might have co&s;t &s;ome Blood: If he &s;ate &s;till, and de&s;i&s;ted upon that Terrour, he &s;hould, at the be&s;t, have confe&s;&s;ed his own want of Power, and the weakne&s;s of the Law. In that &s;treight, he put on a &s;uddain Re&s;olution, to try whether his own Pre&s;ence, and a clear di&s;covery of his Intention, which happily <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> might not have been &s;o well under&s;tood, could remove tho&s;e Doubts, and prevent tho&s;e Inconveniences, which &s;eem'd to have been threaten'd; and thereupon, he re&s;olved to go, in his own Per&s;on, to the Hou&s;e of Commons; which he di&s;covered not, till the very minute of his going; when he &s;ent out Orders, that his Servants, and &s;uch Gentlemen as were then in his Court, &s;hould attend him to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> but giving them expre&s;s Command, as he had expre&s;&s;ed in his An&s;wer to the Ordi|nance, that no Accidents, or Provocation, &s;hould draw them to any &s;uch Action, as might imply a purpo&s;e of Force in his Maje&s;ty: And Him&s;elf, requiring tho&s;e of his Train not to come within the Door, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> went into the Hou&s;e of Commons; the bare doing of which, he did not then conceive, would have been thought more a breach of Privi|ledge, than if he had gone to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ent for them to come to him; which was the u&s;ual cu&s;tom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE u&s;ed the be&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions he could, to a&s;&s;ure them how far he was from any intention of violating their Priviledges; that he intended to proceed legally, and &s;peedily again&s;t the Per&s;ons he had accu&s;ed; and de&s;ired therefore, if they were in the Hou&s;e, that they might be delivered to him; or if ab&s;ent, that &s;uch cour&s;e might be taken for their forth coming, as might &s;atisfy his ju&s;t Demands; and &s;o he de|parted, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> having no other purpo&s;e of Force, if they had been in the Hou&s;e, than he had before prote&s;ted, before God, in his An&s;wer to the Ordi|nance.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HIS Maje&s;ty &s;aid, there would be no end of this di&s;cour&s;e, and of up|braiding him with evil Coun&s;ellors, if, upon his con&s;tant denial of know|ing any, they would not vouch&s;afe to inform him of them; and after eight Months amu&s;ing the Kingdom with the expectation of the di&s;|covery of a Malignant Party, and of evil Coun&s;ellors, they would not at la&s;t name any, nor de&s;cribe them. Let the Actions or Lives of Men be examined, Who had contrived, coun&s;elled, actually con&s;ented to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> grieve, and burthen his People; and if &s;uch were now about his Ma|je&s;ty, or any again&s;t whom any notorious, malicious crime could be proved, if He &s;helter'd and protected any &s;uch, let his Inju&s;tice be publi&s;hed to the world: but till that were done Particularly and Ma|nife&s;tly (for he &s;hould never conclude any Man upon a bare, general Vote of the Major part of either, or both Hou&s;es, till it were evident, that that Major part was without Pa&s;&s;ion or Affection) he mu&s;t look upon the charge that Declaration put upon him, of cheri&s;hing and coun|tenancing a di&s;contented party of the Kingdom again&s;t them, as a hea|vier and unju&s;ter Tax upon his Ju&s;tice and Honour, than any He had, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> or could lay, upon the framers of that Declaration. And now, to countenance tho&s;e unhand&s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions, whereby they u&s;ually had implied his Maje&s;ty's connivance at, or want of Zeal again&s;t, the Re|bellion of <HI>Ireland</HI> (&s;o odious to all good Men) they had found a new way of exprobration: That the Proclamation again&s;t tho&s;e bloody Traytors came not out, till the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> tho' that Rebel|lion broke out in <HI>October;</HI> and then, by &s;pecial command from his Maje&s;ty, but forty copies were appointed to be printed. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid it was well known where he was at that time, when that Rebel|lion broke forth; in <HI>Scotland:</HI> That He immediately, from thence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> recommended the care of that Bu&s;ine&s;s to both Hou&s;es of Parliament here, after he had provided for all fitting Supplies from his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland:</HI> That after his return hither, he ob&s;erved all tho&s;e Forms for that Service, which he was advi&s;ed to by his Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or both Hou&s;es of Parliament here; and if no Proclamation i&s;&s;ued out &s;ooner (of which, for the pre&s;ent, he was not certain; but thought that others, by his directions, were i&s;&s;ued before that time) it was, be|cau&s;e the Lords Ju&s;tices of the Kingdom de&s;ired them no &s;ooner; and when they did, the Number they de&s;ired was but Twenty; which they advi&s;ed might be &s;igned by his Maje&s;ty; which he, for expedition of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the Service, commanded to be printed; a Circum&s;tance not required by them: thereupon he &s;igned more of them, than his Ju&s;tices de&s;ired; all which was very well known to &s;ome Members of one, or both Hou&s;es of Parliament&punc; who had the more to An&s;wer, if they forbore to expre&s;s it at the pa&s;&s;ing of that Declaration; and if they did expre&s;s it, he had the greater rea&s;on to complain, that &s;o envious an A&s;per&s;ion &s;hould be ca&s;t on his Maje&s;ty to his People, when they knew well how to An&s;wer their own Objection.</Q></P>

And if the Penner of that Declara|tion had been careful of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, he would never have denied (and thereupon found fault with his Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t indignation) in the Text or Margent, that his Maje&s;ty had never been charged with the intention of any Force; and that in their whole Declaration, there was no one word tending to any &s;uch reproach; the contrary whereof was &s;o evident, that his Maje&s;ty was, in expre&s;s terms, charged in that Declaration, that he had &s;ent them gracious Me&s;&s;ages, when, with His privity, bringing up the Army was in agitation; and, even in that De|claration, they &s;ought to make the People believe &s;ome &s;uch thing to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> be proved, in the depo&s;itions therewith publi&s;hed; wherein, his Ma|je&s;ty doubted not, they would as much fail, as they did in their cen&s;ure of that Petition, &s;hewed formerly to his Maje&s;ty by Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribed by him C.

If a Faction &s;hould at any time by cunning, or force, or ab&s;ence, or accident, prevail over a Major part of both Hou&s;es; and pretend that there were evil Coun&s;ellors, a Malignant Party, about the King; by whom the Religion, and Liberty of the Kingdom, were both in danger (this they might do, they had done it <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> then) they might take away, be it from the King, or People, what|&s;oever they, in their judgments, &s;hould think fit. This was Lawful, they had declared it &s;o: Let the world judge, whether his Maje&s;ty had charged them unju&s;tly; and whether they were not guilty of the Crime, which them&s;elves confe&s;&s;ed (being proved) was a great One; and how &s;afely his Maje&s;ty might commit the power, tho&s;e People de&s;ired, into Their hands; who, in all probability, would be no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, than they would revive that Tragedy, which M^r <HI>Hooker</HI> related of the Anabapti&s;ts in <HI>Germany;</HI> who, talking of nothing but Faith, and of the true Fear of God, and that Riches and Honour were <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Vanity; at fir&s;t, upon the great opinion of their Humility, Zeal, and Devotion, procured much reverence, and e&s;timation with the People; after, finding how many Per&s;ons they had en&s;nared with their Hypo|cri&s;y, they begun to propo&s;e to them&s;elves to reform both the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, and Civil Government of the State: Then, becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly they might meet with &s;ome oppo&s;ition, they &s;ecretly enter'd into a League of A&s;&s;ociation; and &s;hortly after, finding the power they had gotten with the credulous People, enriched them&s;elves with all kind of Spoile and Pillage; and ju&s;tified them&s;elves upon our Saviours pro|mi&s;e, <HI>The meek &s;hall inherit the Earth;</HI> and declared Their Title <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> was the &s;ame, which the righteous <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had to the Goods of the wicked <HI>Egyptians:</HI> His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, this &s;tory was worth the reading at large, and needed no application.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT his Maje&s;ty might by no means &s;ay, that He had the &s;ame Title to his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and the Ammunition there, as any of his Sub|jects had to their Land, or Money: That was a Principle, that pulled up the Foundation of the Liberty, and Property of every Subject. Why? becau&s;e the King's Property in his Towns, and in his Goods bought with the publick Money, as they conceive his Magazine at <HI>Hull</HI> to be, was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Subjects property in their Lands, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Goods, and Liberty. Did tho&s;e Men think, that as they a&s;&s;umed a power of declaring Law (and what&s;oever contradicted that Declaration broke their Priviledges) &s;o that they had a power of declaring Sen&s;e,
<PB N="481" REF="4990">
and Rea&s;on, and impo&s;ing Logick, and Syllogi&s;ms on the Schools, as well as Law upon the People? Did not all Mankind know that &s;everal Men might have &s;everal Rights, and Intere&s;ts in the &s;elf &s;ame Hou&s;e and Land, and yet neither de&s;troy the other? Was not the Intere&s;t of the Lord <HI>Paramount</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with that of the Me&s;ne Lord; and His with that of the Tenant; and yet their Properties or Intere&s;ts not at all confounded&punc; And why might not his Maje&s;ty then have a full, Lawful Intere&s;t, and Property in his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and yet his Sub|jects have a Property in their Hou&s;es too? But he could not &s;ell, or <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> give away at his Plea&s;ure this Town and Fort, as a private Man might do his Lands or Goods. What then? Many men have no Authority to let, or &s;et their Lea&s;es, or &s;ell their Land, have they therefore no Title to them, or Intere&s;t in them? May they be taken from them, becau&s;e they cannot &s;ell them? He &s;aid, the purpo&s;e of his Journey to <HI>Hull,</HI> was neither to &s;ell, or give it away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT for the Magazine, the Munition there, that he bought with his own Money, he might &s;urely have &s;old that, lent, or given it away. No; he bought it with the publick Money; and the Proof is, They conceive it &s;o; and, upon that Conceit, had Voted, that it &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> taken from him. Excellent Ju&s;tice! &s;uppo&s;e his Maje&s;ty had kept that Money by him, and not bought Armes with it, would they have taken it from him upon that Conceit: Nay might they not, where&s;oever that Money was (for through how many hands &s;oever it hath pa&s;&s;ed, it is the publick Money &s;till, if ever it were) &s;ei&s;e it, and take it from the owners? But the Towns, Forts, Magazine, and Kingdom, is en|tru&s;ted to his Maje&s;ty; and he is a Per&s;on tru&s;ted. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, he was &s;o; God, and the Law had tru&s;ted him; and he had taken an Oath to di&s;charge that Tru&s;t, for the good and &s;afety of the People. What Oaths They had taken, he knew not, unle&s;s tho&s;e, which, in that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> violence, they had manife&s;tly, maliciou&s;ly violated. Might any thing be taken from a Man, becau&s;e he is tru&s;ted with it? Nay, may the Per&s;on him&s;elf take away the thing he tru&s;ts, when he will, and in what manner he will? The Law had been otherwi&s;e, and, he believed, would be &s;o held, notwith&s;tanding their Declarations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT that Tru&s;t ought to be managed by their Advice, and the King|dom had tru&s;ted Them for that purpo&s;e. Impo&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame Tru&s;t &s;hould be irrevocably committed to his Maje&s;ty, and his Heirs for ever, and the &s;ame Tru&s;t, and a Power above that Tru&s;t (for &s;o was the Power they pretended) be committed to others. Did not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the People, that &s;ent them, look upon them as a body but temporary, and di&s;&s;olvable at his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure? And could it be believed, that they intended them for his Guardians, and Controllers in the managing of that Tru&s;t, which God and the Law had granted to Him, and to his Po&s;terity for ever? What the extent of the Commi&s;&s;ion, and Tru&s;t was, nothing could better teach them than the Writ, where|by they are met. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, he called them (and without that call, they could not have come together) to be his Coun&s;ellors, not Commanders (for however they frequently confounded them, the Of|fices were &s;everal) and Coun&s;ellors not in all things, but in &s;ome things, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> <HI>de quibu&s;dam arduis</HI> &amp;c. And they would ea&s;ily find among their Precedents, that Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> upon who&s;e time all good Men looked with reverence, committed one <HI>Wentworth,</HI> a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to the Tower, &s;itting the Hou&s;e, but for propo&s;ing that they

might advi&s;e the Queen, in a matter &s;he thought they had nothing to do to meddle in. But his Maje&s;ty is tru&s;ted: And is He the only Per|&s;on tru&s;ted? And might they do, what their own inclination and fury led them to? Were They not tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, when he fir&s;t &s;ent for them; and were they not tru&s;ted by him, when he pa&s;&s;ed them his promi&s;e, that he would not Di&s;&s;olve them? Could it be pre&s;umed (and pre&s;umptions go far with Them) that he tru&s;ted them with a power to de&s;troy him&s;elf, and to di&s;&s;olve his Government, and Autho|rity? If the People might be allowed to make an equitable con&s;truction of the Laws and Statutes, a Doctrine avowed by Them, would not all <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> his good Subjects &s;wear, he never intended by that Act of Continuance, that they &s;hould do what they have &s;ince done? Were they not tru&s;ted by tho&s;e that &s;ent them? And were they tru&s;ted to alter the Govern|ment of Church and State; and to make them&s;elves perpetual Dicta|tors over the King, and People? Did they intend, that the Law it &s;elf &s;hould be &s;ubject to their Votes; and that what&s;oever They &s;aid, or did, &s;hould be Lawful, becau&s;e They declared it &s;o? The Oaths they had taken who &s;ent them, and without taking which, them&s;elves were not capable of their place in Parliament, made the one incapable of giving, and the other of receiving &s;uch a Tru&s;t; unle&s;s they could per&s;wade <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> his good Subjects, that his Maje&s;ty is the only &s;upreme Head, and Go|vernour in all Cau&s;es, and over all Per&s;ons, within his Dominions; and yet that They had a Power over him to con&s;train him to manage his Tru&s;t, and Govern his Power, according to their Di&s;cretion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE Contrivers of that Declaration told his Maje&s;ty, that they would never allow him (an humble, and dutiful expre&s;&s;ion) to be judge of the Law; That belonged only to Them; They might, and mu&s;t, judge and declare. His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, they all knew what power the Pope, under pretence of interpreting Scriptures, and declaring Ar|ticles of Faith, tho' he decline the making the one or the other, had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> u&s;urped over Men's con&s;ciences; and that, under colour of having power of ordering all things for the good of Men's Souls, he entitles him&s;elf to all the Kingdoms of the world: He would not accu&s;e the Framers of that Declaration (how bold &s;oever they were with his Maje&s;ty) that they inclined to Popery, of which another Maxim was, That all Men mu&s;t &s;ubmit their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, and the Scripture it &s;elf, to that declaring power of his: Neither would he tell them, tho' They had told Him &s;o, that they u&s;e the very Language of the Rebels of <HI>Ireland&punc;</HI> and yet they &s;ay tho&s;e Rebels declare, that what|&s;oever they do, is for the Good of the King and Kingdom.

whom the Kingdom had tru&s;ted for that purpo&s;e, it being their duty to &s;ee it di&s;charged according to the condition, and true intent thereof, and by all po&s;&s;ible means to prevent the contrary: His Maje&s;ty &s;aid, let all his good Subjects con&s;ider, if that Rebellion had been plotted with all that formality, and tho&s;e circum&s;tances declared to be legal, at lea&s;t according to the Equitable &s;en&s;e of the Law, and to be for the publick good, and ju&s;tifiable by nece&s;&s;ity, of which They were the only Judges, whether, tho' they might have thought their de&s;ign to be more Cunning, they would believe it the more Ju&s;tifiable.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BUT, his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, that Demand, as unrea&s;onable as it was, was but one Link of a great Chain, and but the fir&s;t Round of that Ladder, by which his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;t, Ancient, Regal Power, was en|deavoured to be &s;etched down to the ground; for it appeared plainly that it was not with the Per&s;ons now cho&s;en, but with his Maje&s;ty's <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Choo&s;ing, that they were di&s;plea&s;ed: For they demanded, that the Per|&s;ons put into the Places and Imployments of tho&s;e, who &s;hould be re|moved, might be approved by both Hou&s;es; which was &s;o far from being le&s;s than the power of Nomination, that of two things, of which he would never grant either, he would &s;ooner be content, that They &s;hould Nominate, and He Approve; than they Approve and his Ma|je&s;ty Nominate; the meer Nomination being &s;o far from being any thing, that if he could do no More, he would never take the pains to do That; when he &s;hould only hazard whom he e&s;teem'd to the Scorn of a Refu&s;al, if they happen&punc;d not to be agreeable not only to the Judg|ment, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> but to the Pa&s;&s;ion, Intere&s;t, or Humour of the pre&s;ent Major part of either Hou&s;e: Not to &s;peak of the great Factions, Animo&s;ities, and Divi&s;ions, which that power would introduce in both Hou&s;es, and in the &s;everal Counties for the choice of Per&s;ons to be &s;ent to that place, where that power was; and between the Perfons that were &s;o cho&s;en. Neither was that &s;trange Potion pre&s;cribed to him only for once, for the cure of a pre&s;ent, pre&s;&s;ing, de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;e; but for a Diet to Him, and his Po&s;terity.

Neither was it only demanded that his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hould quit the power, and right, his Predece&s;&s;ors had had of ap|pointing Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Places; but for Coun&s;ellors, he was to be re|&s;train'd, as well in the Number as in the Per&s;ons; and a power mu&s;t be annexed to tho&s;e Places, which their Predece&s;&s;ors had not.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE told them, to grant their Demands in the manner they propo&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> them, that all Matters that concern'd the Publick &amp;c. &s;hould be re|&s;olved, and tran&s;acted only in Parliament, and &s;uch other matters of State &amp;c. by the Privy Council &s;o cho&s;en, was in effect at once to de|po&s;e Him&s;elf, and his Po&s;terity.

Nothing more concern'd the Publick, and was indeed more proper for the high Court of Parliament, than the making of Laws; which not only ought <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"> there to be tran&s;acted, but could be tran&s;acted no where el&s;e. But then they mu&s;t admit his Maje&s;ty to be a Part of the Parliament; they mu&s;t not (as the &s;en&s;e was of that part of that Demand, if it had any) deny the freedom of his An&s;wer, when He had as much right to reject what he thought unrea&s;onable, as They had to propo&s;e what they thought convenient, or nece&s;&s;ary. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible his An&s;wers, either to Bills or any other Propo&s;itions, &s;hould be wholely free, if he might not u&s;e the liberty, that every one of Them, and every Sub|ject took, to receive Advice (without their danger who &s;hould give it) from any Per&s;on known or unknown, &s;worn or un&s;worn, in tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> matters in which the manage of his Vote is tru&s;ted, by the Law, to his own judgment and con&s;cience; which how be&s;t to inform was, and ever &s;hould be, left likewi&s;e to Him.

And it was not plainly expre&s;&s;ed, whe|ther they meant his Maje&s;ty &s;o much as a &s;ingle Vote in tho&s;e Affairs; but it was plain they meant him no more, at mo&s;t, than a &s;ingle Vote in them; and no more power, than every one of the re&s;t of his fellow Coun&s;ellors.</Q></P>

And for any alteration in the Government of the Church, that a National Synod &s;hould be called, to propo&s;e what &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary or conve|nient: And that for the advancement of the Prote&s;tant Religion again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, they had not propo&s;ed &s;o much to his Maje&s;ty, as he was willing to grant, or as he had him&s;elf offer'd before.

hone&s;tly con&s;ent to. S^r <HI>Henry Killigrew,</HI> who was a remarkable Enemy to all their devices, being called upon, told them, <Q>&startq;&endq;if there were occa|&s;ion, he would provide a good Hor&s;e, and a good Sword; and made no que&s;tion but he &s;hould find a good Cau&s;e.</Q> But, within very few days, both He, and all tho&s;e who were taken notice of for refu&s;ing, found it safe&s;t for them to leave the Town; there being very vi&s;ibly great ani|mo&s;ity again&s;t them both within, and without the Walls. And a Gen|tleman of good Quality a&s;&s;ured me afterwards, that, within few days after he had refu&s;ed to Sub&s;cribe, he was privately advi&s;ed by one of the other Faction, who yet retained &s;ome kindne&s;s to him, <Q>&startq;&endq;to leave the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Town,</Q> left his Brains were beaten out by the Boys in the Streets. And many of tho&s;e, who too impotently de&s;ired not to be looked upon as Refr$ctory Per&s;ons, and had plea&s;ed them&s;elves with Sub&s;cribing more Articulately for the defence of the King's Per&s;on, found it afterwards nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply what&s;oever they had Sub&s;cribed, to be imployed that way as was Declared to be for the defence of the King's Per&s;on, what|&s;oever their Intention was at fir&s;t, or their Opinion after. And it is hardly credible, what a va&s;t proportion of Plate was brought in to their Trea&s;urers within ten days; there being hardly Men enough to receive <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> it, or room to lay it in; and the Throng being &s;o great of the Bringers, that, in two days attendance, many could not be di&s;charged of their Se|ditious Offerings. And, the very next day after the&s;e Propo&s;itions, they further ordered, <Q>&startq;&endq;that there &s;hould be a &s;trict &s;earch and examination made, by the Ju&s;tices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and Con&s;tables, near all the Northern Roads, for the &s;ei&s;ing all Hor&s;es for &s;ervice in the Wars, or great Saddles, that &s;hould be carried towards the North parts of <HI>England,</HI> without the Privity or Direction of one or both Hou&s;es of Parliament;</Q> which was a great improvement of their former Or|der, which extended only to Armes and Ammunition; tho', the truth <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> is, the Dexterity and Spirit of their Mini&s;ters, who knew their Mean|ing, made the former allmo&s;t as inconvenient and dangerous to Pa&s;&s;en|gers, as the latter.</P>
<P>IT was by many impatiently wonder'd at Then, and, no doubt, will be more cen&s;ured Hereafter, that, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e inva&s;ions, and breaches upon the Regal Power, and all the&s;e va&s;t Preparations to de&s;troy him, the King, hitherto, put not him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of &s;afety; or provided for the re&s;i&s;tance of that Power, which threatn'd him; and which, he could not but know, Intended what&s;oever it hath &s;ince Done; And tho' they had not yet form'd an Army, and cho&s;en a General, yet, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> he well knew, they had Materials abundantly ready for the fir&s;t, and particular, dige&s;ted re&s;olutions, in the &s;econd; which they could reduce to publick Acts, when&s;oever they plea&s;ed. It is very true he did know all this, and the un&s;peakable hazards he run, in not preparing again&s;t it. But the hazards, which pre&s;ented them&s;elves unto him on the other &s;ide, were not le&s;s Prodigious: He had a very great appearance of the Nobi|lity; and not only of tho&s;e, who had from the beginning walked, and governed them&s;elves by the Rules the Law pre&s;cribed, and, in that re|&s;pect, were unblamable to King and People: But of Others who had pa&s;&s;ionately and peevi&s;hly (to &s;ay no wor&s;e) concurred in all the mo&s;t <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> violent Votes and Actions, which had been done from the beginning: For be&s;ides the Lord <HI>Spencer</HI> (who had been cho&s;en their Lieutenant of <HI>Northampton&punc;&s;hire,</HI> but was recovered to a right under&s;tanding, of which he was very capable, by his Uncle the Earl of <HI>Southampton)</HI> the Lord

<HI>Paget</HI> likewi&s;e, who had contributed all his Faculties to Their &s;ervice, and to the prejudice of the King's, from before the beginning of the Par|liament; had been one of their Teizers to broach tho&s;e bold high Over|tures &s;oberer Men were not, at fir&s;t, willing to be &s;een in; and had been, as a Man mo&s;t worthy to be Confided in, cho&s;en Lord Lieutenant of one of the mo&s;t Confiding Counties, the County of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (where he had, with great Solemnity and Pomp, executed their Ordinance, in defiance of the King's Proclamation) and had Sub&s;cribed a greater num|ber of Hor&s;es for their Service, upon their Propo&s;itions, than any other of the &s;ame Quality; convinced in his con&s;cience, fled from them, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> be&s;ought the King's Pardon: And, for the better manife&s;ting the tender|ne&s;s of his Compunction, and the horrour he had of his former Guilt, he frankly di&s;covered what&s;oever he had known of their Coun&s;els; and aggravated all the ill they had done, with declaring it to be done to wor&s;e and more horrid Ends, than many good Men believed to be po&s;&s;ible for them to propo&s;e to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, this glorious Convention was rather an Or|nament to his Court, than any great Advantage to his Coun&s;els; and the u&s;e of them more to di&s;credit the &s;mall remainder at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and that the People might &s;ee the number and quality of the Di&s;&s;enters, than <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> that they contrived any thing to the active improvement of his affairs; every Man thinking it high merit in him, that he ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the Company and Place, where all the mi&s;chief was done; and that the keeping him&s;elf Negatively innocent, was as much as he owed his King and Country. I am willing to impute it to the drow&s;y and unactive Genius of the Kingdom (contracted by long ea&s;e, and quiet) which &s;o much abhorred the thoughts of a Civil War, that it thought a lively and vigorous preparation again&s;t it, was to invite it; and there were very few of all the great Lords, who did attend upon the King, who did not declare, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Parliament dur&s;t not in truth (whatever &s;hews they <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> made in hope to &s;hake his Maje&s;ty's con&s;tancy) make a War; and if they &s;hould attempt it, the People would unanimou&s;ly ri&s;e for the King, who would be mo&s;t &s;afe by not intending his own &s;afety. Where|as, if he rai&s;ed Forces, the Parliament would procure them&s;elves to be believed, that it was to overthrow Religion, and &s;uppre&s;s the Laws, and Liberties of the People.</Q> They who were of another opinion, and could have &s;poken more rea&s;on, held it not &s;afe to expre&s;s them&s;elves but in the King's own Ear; there being in the great Council of the Peers, who, for &s;tate, were frequently A&s;&s;embled, and by whom in truth the King then de&s;ired to have tran&s;acted all things of Moment, &s;ome who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> were not good Coun&s;el-Keepers, and others who were looked upon, and believed to be Spies upon the re&s;t. But that which made the thought of rai&s;ing Forces (whatever Arguments there were for it) ab&s;olutely un|rea&s;onable, was, that the King had no po&s;&s;ibility to procure either Armes, or Munition, but from <HI>Holland;</HI> from whence he daily expected &s;up|ply: And till that arrived, let his Provocations and Sufferings be what they could be, he was to &s;ubmit and bear it patiently.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, for a ground of further proceeding upon occa&s;ion, the King de&s;ired the Peers in Council, to &s;et down in writing the Affronts, and Violence, which had been offer'd to them at <HI>London,</HI> by which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> their Pre&s;ence in the great Council of the Kingdom was rendr'd both un&s;afe, and di&s;honourable; the which they the more willingly conde|&s;cended to, for that the <HI>London</HI> Pamphlets allready a&s;per&s;ed them, as

Parchment, at mo&s;t eminent places, under &s;ome opprobrious Character; which, tho' it was not avowed, and had no Authority from the Hou&s;e by any publick Act, yet, being complain'd of, was neither redre&s;&s;ed, nor was the complaint &s;o countenanced, that it could be concluded the Vio|lation was unacceptable: &s;o, tho' the Tumults were not directly &s;um|mon'd or a&s;&s;embled, it is evident, by what hath been before &s;et forth truly and at large, that they found there vi&s;ible countenance, and en|couragement.</P>
<P>THEN, what had been, upon full and &s;olemn Debates in a full Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> rejected, was many times, in a thin Hou&s;e, and at unu&s;ual and unpar|liamentary Hours, re&s;umed, and determined contrary to the former Conclu&s;ions: Yet Men &s;atisfied them&s;elves with doing what they thought their Duty, and rea&s;onably oppo&s;ing what the Major part order'd to be done; hoping that Men's under&s;tandings would be &s;hortly better in|form'd; and that tho' high and irreverent Expre&s;&s;ions, and Words were &s;ometimes u&s;ed again&s;t the King, there would be ab&s;taining from un|lawful and dangerous Actions; and that the Hou&s;e of Peers, at lea&s;t, would never be brought to joyn, or concur in any Act prejudicial to the Soveraign power.

<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> IT is true, how rea&s;onably &s;oever it might be expected, it produced not that Ingenuity; but they who had been troubled with the company of them that afterwards withdrew, and, by the oppo&s;ition they made, could not make that expedition in the mi&s;chief they intended, were glad

they were rid of them; yet, &s;hortly, con&s;idering what influence indeed it might have upon under&s;tanding Men, they found a way to ca&s;t a re|proach upon tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent, and yet to prevent any inconve|nience to them&s;elves by their return; publi&s;hing an Order, <Q>&startq;&endq;that all the Members ab&s;ent &s;hould appear at &s;uch a day, under the Penalty of paying each 100' fine for his ab&s;ence; and who&s;oever did not ap|pear at that day (which gave not time enough to any who were at a di&s;tance) "&s;hould not pre&s;ume to &s;it in the Hou&s;e, before he had paid his fine,</Q> and &s;atisfied the Hou&s;e with the cau&s;e of his ab&s;ence; So that all tho&s;e who were with the King, and very many more, who had really <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> withdrawn them&s;elves to refre&s;h their minds, or upon nece&s;&s;ary affairs of their own, with a purpo&s;e to return, clearly di&s;cern&punc;d them&s;elves ex|cluded from &s;itting any more there; it being &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, that the Cau&s;e of their ab&s;ence would never be approved, if their Per&s;ons were di&s;liked, and their Opinions di&s;approved: Which appeared quickly; for the day was no &s;ooner pa&s;t, but they, without the lea&s;t warrant of Precedent or colour of Right, expelled very many, &s;ometimes twenty a day, not only of tho&s;e who were with the King, but of others who had given them equal di&s;ta&s;t; and order'd new Writs to i&s;&s;ue out to choo&s;e other Members in their Rooms. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but &s;ome very hone&s;t and intire Men &s;tayed &s;till there, and oppo&s;ed all their unju&s;tifiable proceedings with great courage, and much liberty of Speech; which was more frankly permitted to them than had been before, when the Number of the Di&s;&s;enters was greater; and it may be there are &s;till &s;ome who &s;atisfy them&s;elves that they have performed their Duty, by allways having denied to give their con&s;ent to what&s;oever hath been &s;editiou&s;ly, or illegally concluded. But I mu&s;t Appeal to the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e very Men, whether they have not been many times, by &s;taying there, compelled or terrified to do, and &s;ubmit to many Acts contrary to their Con&s;cience, in ca&s;es of Con&s;cience; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and contrary to their Judgment and Knowledge, in matters of Law, and Right; and contrary to their Oaths and Duties, in matters of Alle|giance; and whether if they had refu&s;ed &s;o to do, they &s;hould not have been plunder'd, expelled, and committed to Pri&s;on? And then They cannot be thought to have proceeded unrea&s;onably, who, to pe&s;erve their Innocence, and their Liberty, cho&s;e to undergo all the other Cen|&s;ures and Difficulties, which could befall them, and which have been &s;ince plentifully poured upon them.

<P>THE King had, at this time, called to him &s;ome Judges, and Lawyers of eminency; by who&s;e Advice he publi&s;hed a Declaration concerning <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> the Militia, and a&s;&s;erted <Q>&startq;&endq;the Right of the Crown in granting Commi&s;|&s;ions of Array,</Q> for the better ordering and governing thereof; and, at the &s;ame time, i&s;&s;ued out tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions to all Counties, <Q>&startq;&endq;expre&s;sly forbidding any obedience to be given to the Ordinance for the Militia by both Hou&s;es,</Q> under the penalty of High Trea&s;on. This only im|proved the Paper-combate in Declarations; either Party in&s;i&s;ting, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Law was on Their &s;ide;</Q> and the People giving obedience to either, according to their conveniences: And many did believe, that if the King had re&s;orted to the old known way of Lord Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants, his &s;ervice would have been better carried on; the Com|mi&s;&s;ion <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of Array being a thing they had not before heard of, tho' founded upon an Ancient Act of Parliament in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. and &s;o was received with jealou&s;y, and ea&s;ily di&s;credited by the glo&s;&s;es and &s;ug|ge&s;tions of the Hou&s;es.</P>

BESIDES that &s;ome Men of very good Affections to the Crown, and aver&s;e enough to the extravagant pretences and proceedings of the Par|liament, did not conceal their prejudice to the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, as not warranted by Law; which did very much work upon other Men, and made the obedience le&s;s chearful that was given to that &s;ervice. M^r <HI>Selden</HI> had, in the Debate upon that Subject in the Hou&s;e of Commons, declared him&s;elf very po&s;itively, and with much &s;harpne&s;s&punc; again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, as a thing expre&s;sly without any Authority of Law; the Statute upon which it was grounded being, as he &s;aid, re|pealed; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> and di&s;cour&s;ed very much of the ill Con&s;equences, which might re&s;ult from &s;ubmitting to it: He an&s;wer'd the Arguments which had been u&s;ed to &s;upport it; and ea&s;ily prevailed with the Hou&s;e not to like a proceeding, which they knew was intended to do them hurt, and to le&s;&s;en their Authority, But his Authority and Reputation prevailed much further than the Hou&s;e, and begot a prejudice again&s;t it in many well affected Men without doors: When the King was inform'd of it, he was much troubled, having looked upon M^r <HI>Selden</HI> as well di&s;po&s;ed to his Service, And the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> with his Maje&s;ty's leave, writ a friendly Letter to M^r <HI>Selden,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;to know his rea&s;on, why, in &s;uch a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> conjuncture, whatever his opinion were, he would oppo&s;e the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, which no body could deny to have had it's original from Law, and which many Learned Men &s;till be|lieved to be very Legal, to make way for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an Ordi|nance,</Q> which had no manner of pretence to Right. He An&s;wer'd this Letter very frankly; as a Man who believed him&s;elf in the right upon the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, and that the Arguments he had u&s;ed again&s;t it could not be An&s;wer'd; &s;umming up &s;ome of tho&s;e Arguments in as few words as they could be comprehended in: But then he did as frankly inveigh again&s;t the Ordinance for the Militia, <Q>&startq;&endq;which, he &s;aid, was with|out <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> any &s;hadow of Law or pretence of Precedent, and mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the Government of the Kingdom: And he did acknowledge, that he had been the more inclined to make that di&s;cour&s;e in the Hou&s;e again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ion, that he might with the more freedom argue again&s;t the Ordinance; which was to be con&s;ider'd upon a day then ap|pointed: And he was mo&s;t confident, that he &s;hould likewi&s;e over|throw the Ordinance; which, he confe&s;&s;ed, could be le&s;s &s;upported; and he did believe, that it would be much better, if both were re|jected,</Q> than if either of them &s;hould &s;tand, and remain uncontrolled. But his confidence deceived him; and he quickly found, that They who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be intirely govern'd by his Rea&s;on, when tho&s;e Conclu&s;ions re&s;ulted from it, which contributed to their own de&s;igns, would not be at all guided by it, or &s;ubmit to it, when it per&s;waded that which contradicted, and would di&s;appoint tho&s;e de&s;igns: And &s;o, upon the day appointed for the debate of their Ordinance, when he applied all his faculties to the convincing them of the illegality and mon&s;trou&s;|ne&s;s of it, by arguments at lea&s;t as clear and demon&s;trable as his former had been, they made no impre&s;&s;ion upon them; but were ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd by tho&s;e, who with mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion in&s;i&s;ted upon their own &s;en&s;e. He had &s;atisfied them very well, when he concurred with them in judgment; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> but his Rea&s;ons were weak, when they cro&s;&s;ed their Re&s;olutions. So mo&s;t Men are deceived in being too rea&s;onable; concluding that Rea&s;on will prevail upon tho&s;e Men to &s;ubmit to what is Right and Ju&s;t, who have no other con&s;ideration of Right or Ju&s;tice, but as it advances their In|tere&s;t,

he could to di&s;po&s;e the States to concern them&s;elves in his Maje&s;ty's Quarrel; yet his Authority, and Intere&s;t, was much dimini&s;hed with the vigour of his Body and Mind: And the States of <HI>Holland</HI> were &s;o far from being inclined to the King, that they did him all the mi&s;chief they could. They had before a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Rebellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with giving them credit for Armes and Ammunition, before they had money to buy any; and they did afterwards, &s;everal ways, di&s;cover their affections to the Parliament; which had &s;o many Spies there, that the Queen could do nothing they had not pre&s;ent notice of; &s;o that it was no ea&s;y mat|ter <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> for the Queen to provide Armes and Ammunition, but the Parlia|ment had pre&s;ent notice of it, and of the ways which were thought upon to Tran&s;port them to the King: And then their Fleet, under the Com|mand of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> lay ready to ob&s;truct and intercept that Communication; nor was any remedy in view to remove this mi&s;chief; in&s;omuch as it was no ea&s;y thing for the King to &s;end to, or to receive Letters from, the Queen.</P>
<P>THERE was a &s;mall Ship of 28 or 30 Guns, that was part of the Fleet that wafted her Maje&s;ty into <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Dover,</HI> which was called the Providence, under the Command of Captain <HI>Straughan,</HI> when <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> the Fleet was Commanded by S^r <HI>John Pennington,</HI> and before the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was &s;uperinduced into that Charge again&s;t the King's Will. That Ship, the Captain whereof was known to be faithful to his Maje&s;ty, was, by the Queen, detain'd, and kept in <HI>Holland</HI> from the time of her Maje&s;ty's Arrival, under &s;everal pretences, of which the Captain made u&s;e, when he afterwards received Orders from the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;to repair to the Fleet in the <HI>Downs;</HI></Q> until, after many promi&s;es and excu&s;es, it was at la&s;t di&s;cern'd, that he had other Bu&s;ine&s;s and Com|mands; and &s;o was watched, by the other Ships, as an Enemy. This Ve&s;&s;el the Queen re&s;olved to &s;end to the King, principally to inform his Ma|je&s;ty <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of the &s;treights &s;he was in; of the provi&s;ions &s;he had made; and to return with &s;uch particular Advice, and Directions from his Maje&s;ty, that &s;he might take further re&s;olutions: And becau&s;e the Ve&s;&s;el was light, and drew not much Water, and &s;o could run into any Creek, or open Road, or Harbour, and, from thence, ea&s;ily &s;end an expre&s;s to the King; there was put into it about two hunder'd Barrels of Powder, and two or three thou&s;and Armes with &s;even or eight Field-Pieces; which, they knew, would be very welcome to the King, and &s;erve for a beginning and countenance to draw Forces together. The Captain was no &s;ooner put to Sea, but notice was &s;ent to the Commander of the Fleet in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> <HI>Downs;</HI> who immediately &s;ent three or four Ships to the North, which ea&s;ily got the Providence in View, before it could reach that Coa&s;t; and cha&s;ed it with all their Sails, till they &s;aw it enter into the River of <HI>Humber;</HI> when, looking upon it as their own, they made le&s;s ha&s;t to follow it, being content to drive it before them into their own Port of <HI>Hull;</HI> there being, as they thought, no other way to e&s;cape them; un|til they plainly &s;aw the Ship entring into a narrow Creek out of <HI>Humber,</HI> which declined <HI>Hull,</HI> and lead into the Country &s;ome Miles above it; which was a place well known to the Captain, and de&s;ign'd by him to arrive at from the beginning. It was in vain for them then to ha&s;ten <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> their pur&s;uit; for they quickly found that their great Ships could not enter into that pa&s;&s;age, and that the River was too &s;hallow to follow him; and &s;o, with &s;hame and anger, they gave over the Cha&s;e; whil&s;t the Captain continued his cour&s;e; and having never thought of &s;aving
<PB N="522" REF="5400">
the Ship, run it on Shoar on that &s;ide towards <HI>Burlington;</HI> and, with all expedition, gave notice to the King of his arrival; who, immediately, cau&s;ed the Per&s;ons of Quality, in the parts adjacent, to draw the Train'd bands of the Country together, to &s;ecure the incur&s;ions from <HI>Hull;</HI> and by this means, the Armes, Ammunition, and Artillery, were quickly brought to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was well content that it &s;hould be generally believed, that this &s;mall Ship, the &s;ize whereof was known to few, had brought a greater quantity and proportion of Provi&s;ions for the War, than in truth <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> it had; and therefore, tho' it had brought no Money, which he expected, he forthwith granted Commi&s;&s;ions, to rai&s;e Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot, to &s;uch Per&s;ons of Quality and Intere&s;t, as were able to comply with their obligations. He declared the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> Lord High Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> his General of the Army; a Per&s;on of great Honour and Courage, and generally beloved; who many years before had good Commands in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and had been Admiral at Sea in &s;everal Expeditions. S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley</HI> was declared Major Ge|neral of the Foot, a Command he was very equal to, and had exerci&s;ed before, and executed after, with great approbation. The General&s;hip of the Hor&s;e, his Maje&s;ty pre&s;erved for his Nephew Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> who was dayly expected, and arrived &s;oon after: And all Levies were ha&s;ten'd with as much expedition as was po&s;&s;ible in &s;o great a &s;carcity, and notorious want of Money; of which no more need be &s;aid, after it is remember'd that all the Lords, and Council about the King, with &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Quality, voluntarily made a Sub&s;cription for the payment of &s;o many Hor&s;e for three Months; in which time they would needs believe, that the War &s;hould be at an end; every one pay|ing down what the three Months pay would amount to, into the hands of a Trea&s;urer appointed to receive it; and this Money was pre&s;ently paid for the making tho&s;e Levies of Hor&s;e, which were de&s;ign'd; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> which could not have been made but by tho&s;e Moneys.</P>
<P>AND now the King thought it time to execute a Re&s;olution he had long intended, and which many Men wonder'd he neglected &s;o long; which was, as much as in Him lay, to take the Admiralty into his own hands. He had long too much cau&s;e to be un&s;atisfied, and di&s;plea&s;ed with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> whom, he thought, he had obliged above any Man what&s;oever. His delivering the Fleet into the hands and Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> after his Maje&s;ty had expre&s;sly re|fu&s;ed it to the Parliament, the King could not ea&s;ily forgive; however he thought it not Then &s;ea&s;onable to re&s;ent it, becau&s;e he had nothing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to object again&s;t him, but his complyance with the Command of the Par|liament, who would have own'd it as their own quarrel; and mu&s;t have obliged that Earl to put his whole Intere&s;t into Their hands, and to have run Their Fortune; to which he was naturally too much inclined: And then his Maje&s;ty fore&s;aw, that there would have been no Fleet at all &s;et out that year, by their having the Command of all the Money, which was to be applied to that Service. Whereas, by his Maje&s;ty's concealing his re&s;entment, there was a good Fleet made ready, and &s;et out; and many Gentlemen &s;ettled in the Command of Ships, of who&s;e Affection and Fidelity his Maje&s;ty was a&s;&s;ured, that no Superior Officer <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> could corrupt it; but that they would, at all times, repair to his Service, when ever he required it. And, indeed, his Maje&s;ty had an opinion of the devotion of the whole body of the Common Sea-men to his Service,
<PB N="523" REF="5410">
becau&s;e he had, bountifully, &s;o much mended their condition, and in|crea&s;ed their Pay, that he thought they would have even thrown the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> over Board, when he &s;hould Command them; and &s;o the re&s;piting the doing of it would be of little importance. But now, that a Ship of his own, in the execution of his Commands, &s;hould be cha&s;ed by his own Fleet as an Enemy, made &s;uch a noi&s;e in all places, even to his reproach and di&s;honour, that he could no longer defer the doing what he had &s;o long thought of. He re&s;olved therefore, to revoke the Earl of <HI>Northumberlands</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion of the Office of High-Admi|ral <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of <HI>England,</HI> and to &s;end the Revocation to him under the Great Seal of <HI>England:</HI> Then, to &s;end S^r <HI>John Pennington,</HI> who was then at <HI>York,</HI> on board the Fleet, and to take the Charge of it: and Letters were pre|pared, and &s;ign'd by the King, to every one of the Captains; whereby they were required, "to ob&s;erve the Orders of S^r <HI>John Pennington.</HI> And all this was carried with all po&s;&s;ible Secrecy, that none, but tho&s;e few who were tru&s;ted, knew, or &s;u&s;pected any &s;uch Alteration.</P>
<P>BUT the King thought fit, fir&s;t to advi&s;e with S^r <HI>John Pennington;</HI> of who&s;e Integrity he was confident, and who&s;e judgment he allways principally relied on in all his Maritime Actions; and thought him the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> only Per&s;on fit immediately to take the Fleet out of the Earl of <HI>War|wicks</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; who had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Him of the Command that year, which he had u&s;ually exerci&s;ed. S^r <HI>John Pennington,</HI> finding the mat|ter full of difficulty, and the execution like to meet with &s;ome inter|ruptions, expre&s;&s;ed no alacrity to undertake it in his own Per&s;on; alledg|ing, <Q>&startq;&endq;that him&s;elf &s;tood in the Parliaments disfavour, and jealou&s;y (which was true) and that therefore his motion, and journey toward the <HI>Downs,</HI> where the Fleet then lay, would be immediately taken notice of; and his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ign be &s;o much gue&s;&s;ed at, that there would need no other Di&s;covery;</Q> but he propounded to his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> would &s;end a Letter to S^r <HI>Robert Man&s;el,</HI> who lived at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> &s;peedily to go to the Fleet, and to take charge of it, and that His Au|thority, being Vice-Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> and his known and great Re|putation with the Sea-men, would be like to meet with the lea&s;t re|&s;i&s;tance.</Q> His Maje&s;ty, imparting this Coun&s;el to tho&s;e whom he had made Privy to his purpo&s;e, enter'd upon new con&s;iderations; and con|cluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;that S^r <HI>Robert Man&s;el</HI>'s age (tho' his Courage and Integrity were unque&s;tionable) and the accidents that depended upon that, would render that Expedient mo&s;t hazardous; and that, in truth, there needed no &s;uch ab&s;olute and &s;upreme Officer, to be appointed in the fir&s;t Ar|ticle; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> but rather, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould direct his &s;pecial Letter to the Captain of every Ship, requiring him immediately to weigh An|chor, and to bring away his Ship to &s;uch a place as his Maje&s;ty might appoint, where he &s;hould receive further Orders: And to that place he might &s;end &s;uch an Officer, as he thought fit to tru&s;t with the Com|mand of the whole Navy &s;o a&s;&s;embled.</Q> According to this Re&s;olution, the whole Di&s;patch was prepared. Fir&s;t a Revocation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiral, under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> of which there was a Duplicate; the one to be &s;ent to his Lord&s;hip; the other to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> founded upon, and &s;o determined by, the other. Then a particular Letter to each of the Captains of his Ships, informing them <Q>&startq;&endq;of his Maje&s;ty's Revocation of the Admiral's Patent, and, con&s;equently, of the determination of the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion (to whom his
<PB N="524" REF="5420">
Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e writ,</Q> to <Q>&startq;&endq;inhibit him from further medling in that Charge)</Q> and therefore commanding them to yield no further obedience to either of their Orders; but that, immediately upon the receipt of tho&s;e his Royal Letters, he &s;hould weigh Anchor; and with what &s;peed he might, repair to <HI>Burlington</HI>&punc;Bay upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> where he &s;hould receive his Maje&s;ty's further plea&s;ure: And &s;o each Com|mander, without relation to any other Commands, had no more to look after but his own Ship, and his own Duty; by which the King might expect, at lea&s;t, &s;o many Ships as were under the Command of tho&s;e who had any Affection or Fidelity to his Service. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, all things being prepared, and &s;igned by the King and &s;ealed, what immediately concern'd the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was delivered to one of his Maje&s;ty's Pages, to be given to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> at <HI>London;</HI> and the whole di&s;patch to the Fleet to M^$ <HI>Edward Villiers,</HI> who&s;e diligence and dexterity his Maje&s;ty found fit for any Tru&s;t; the former being directed <Q>&startq;&endq;not to make &s;uch ha&s;t, but that the other might be at lea&s;t a&s;&s;oon at the <HI>Downs,</HI></Q> as He at <HI>London;</HI> and M^$ <HI>Villiers</HI> again being appointed what Letters he &s;hould fir&s;t de|liver to the Captains; <Q>&startq;&endq;and that he &s;hould Vi&s;it the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> in the la&s;t place;</Q> that his Activity might have no influence upon the Sea-men <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to prevent their obedience to his Maje&s;ty. And &s;urely if this re|&s;olution had been pur&s;ued, it is very probable, that the King had been Ma&s;ter of very many of his Ships again. But, when the Me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched, and well in&s;tructed, and he that was for <HI>London</HI> gone on his Journey, there was a &s;uddain and unexpected change of the whole direction to the Fleet, by S^r <HI>John Pennington</HI>'s repair to his Maje&s;ty; and, upon &s;econd thoughts, offering <Q>&startq;&endq;to go Him&s;elf to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and to take Charge of the Fleet,</Q> which changed the Forms of the Letters to the &s;everal Captains; and, in&s;tead of leaving every one to u&s;e his be&s;t expedition to bring away his own Ship to <HI>Burlington,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;required them <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> only to ob&s;erve &s;uch Orders, as they &s;hould receive by S^r <HI>John Pen|nington;</HI></Q> who thought not fit (for the rea&s;ons formerly given of his being taken notice of) to go with M^r <HI>Villiers;</HI> but, by Him, writ to S^r <HI>Henry Palmer,</HI> to whom likewi&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;ent a Letter to that pur|po&s;e, being an Officer of the Navy, and who lived by the <HI>Downs,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;im|mediately to go aboard the Admiral; and that he Him&s;elf would make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to him, &s;etting out at the &s;ame time with M^r <HI>Villiers;</HI></Q> but Journeying a further and more private way. M^r <HI>Villiers,</HI> le&s;t, by his &s;tay for the alteration of his di&s;patches, the Page's coming to <HI>London</HI> &s;ooner than was intended at his &s;etting out, might produce <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> &s;ome inconvenience to the &s;ervice, &s;lept not till he came to S^r <HI>Henry Palmer;</HI> who, being infirm in his health, and &s;urpri&s;ed with the Com|mand, could not make that expedition aboard, as might have been re|qui&s;ite; tho' he was Loyally and Zealou&s;ly affected to his Maje&s;ty's Ser|vice. However, M^r <HI>Villiers</HI> ha&s;ten'd to the Ships which lay then at Anchor, and according to his In&s;tructions, delivered his &s;everal Let|ters to the Captains; the greate&s;t part whereof received them with great expre&s;&s;ions of duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, expecting only to receive S^r <HI>John Pennington</HI>'s Orders, for which they &s;tayed; and, without doubt, if either the fir&s;t Letters had been &s;ent, or S^r <HI>John Pennington</HI> been pre|&s;ent, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> when the&s;e others were delivered, his Maje&s;ty had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t part of the Fleet; the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> being at that time, according to his u&s;ual Licences, with &s;ome Officers who&s;e com|pany
<PB N="525" REF="5430">
he liked, on &s;hoar making merry; &s;o that there was only his Vice-Admiral, Captain <HI>Batten,</HI> on board; who was of eminent di&s;affection to his Maje&s;ty: The Rear-Admiral, S^r <HI>John Mennes,</HI> being of unque&s;tion|able Integrity.</P>
<P>BUT after five or &s;ix hours (in which time nothing could be acted, for want of advice and direction; enough being ready to Obey, but none having Authority to Command) the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> came aboard his Ship, to whom M^r <HI>Villiers</HI> likewi&s;e gave his Maje&s;ty's Letters of his Di&s;charge; who, without any Declaration of di&s;obeying it, applied him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to the confirming tho&s;e, whom he thought true to his Party, and diligently to watch the re&s;t; pre&s;uming, that he &s;hould &s;peedily hear from tho&s;e, by whom he had been originally tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>IN the mean time&punc; the Captains expected Orders from S^r <HI>John Pen|nington;</HI> who likewi&s;e privately expected &s;uch an account from S^r <HI>Henry Palmer,</HI> as might encourage him to come to the Ships. But this unfor|tunate delay di&s;appointed all: For the other Gentleman, according to his In&s;tructions, having reached <HI>London</HI> in the evening after the Hou&s;es were ri&s;en, deliver'd the King's Letter, and the Di&s;charge of his Com|mi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re|vokes the Earl of <HI>Northum|berland</HI>'s Com|mi&s;&s;ion of Ad|miral.</NOTE> to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> who, with all &s;hews of Duty <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> and Submi&s;&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;&endq;his re&s;olution to obey his Maje&s;ty; and a hearty &s;orrow, that he had, by any Misfortune, incurr'd his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure.</Q> How ingenuous &s;oever this demeanour of his Lord&s;hips was, the bu&s;ine&s;s was quickly known to tho&s;e, who were more concern'd in it; who were exceedingly perplexed, with the apppehen&s;ion of being di&s;po&s;&s;ed of &s;o great a part of their &s;trength, as the Royal Fleet; and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;that, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch his Maje&s;ty's Revocation, he would &s;till continue the execution of his Office of Lord High Admiral; in which they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their utmo&s;t and full Power,</Q> and Authority.

<P>THE Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> being thus arm'd, found him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of his Work; and immediately &s;ummon'd all the Captains, to attend him on board his Ship in Council; the which all but two did (Captain <HI>Slingsby,</HI> and Captain <HI>Wake)</HI> who, being by his Maje&s;ty's Letters, as the re&s;t were, expre&s;sly charged to yield no further obedience to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> refu&s;ed to repair to him; making them&s;elves ready to re&s;i&s;t any vio|lence, and putting their Ships in order to go out to Sea, that they might be at Liberty to attend his Maje&s;ty's Commands; but they were &s;o en|compa&s;&s;ed by the whole Fleet, and the dexterity of the Earl's Mini&s;ters
<PB N="526" REF="5440">
was &s;uch, and the devotion, generally, of the Sea-men &s;o tainted, and corrupted from the King's Service, that, in&s;tead of carrying away the Ships, the Captains them&s;elves were &s;ei&s;ed, taken, and carried by their own Men to the Earl; who immediately committed them to Cu&s;tody, and &s;ent them up Pri&s;oners to the Parliament. Then the Earl Commu|nicated the Ordinance, Letters, and Votes from the two Hou&s;es, to the re&s;t of the Officers; of whom only two more refu&s;ed to continue their Charge again&s;t the &s;ignification, they had received from the King (S^r <HI>John Mennes,</HI> and Captain <HI>Burly)</HI> who were quickly di&s;charged, and &s;et on &s;hoar; and the re&s;t, without any &s;cruple or he&s;itation, <Q>&startq;&endq;obliged them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> to obey the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI></Q> in the Service of the Parliament; &s;o that the Storm was now over, and the Parliament fully, and intirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Royal Navy, and Militia by Sea; for they quickly di&s;po&s;ed of two other hone&s;t Captains, <HI>Kettleby,</HI> and <HI>Stradlin</HI> (whom they could not corrupt) who guarded the Iri&s;h Seas; and got tho&s;e Ships likewi&s;e into their Service. And thus his Maje&s;ty was without one Ship of his own, in his three Kingdoms, at his Devotion.</P>

<P>THE truth is, the King was &s;o confident upon the general Affections of the Sea-men, who were a Tribe of People more particularly coun|tenanced and obliged by him, than other Men, his Maje&s;ty having en|crea&s;ed their allowance, in Provi&s;ion and Money, above the old e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Navy, as hath been mention'd; that he did believe no Activity of ill Officers could have corrupted them; but that, when the Parliament had &s;et out and victualled the Fleet, it would, upon any oc|ca&s;ion, declare it &s;elf at his devotion.

<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> THE News of this diminution of his Maje&s;ty's power, and terrible addition of &s;trength to his Enemies, was a great allay to the brisk hopes at <HI>York,</HI> upon the arrival of their Ammunition, and wi&s;e Men ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd the fatal con&s;equence of it in oppo&s;ition to the King's mo&s;t hopeful de&s;igns; yet, in a very &s;hort time, all vi&s;ible &s;en&s;e of it &s;o much vani&s;hed that (as there was a marvellous alacrity, at that time, in de&s;pi&s;ing all advantages of the Parliament) &s;ome Men publickly, and with great confidence, averr'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the King was a Gainer by the lo&s;s of his Fleet; becau&s;e he had no Money to pay the Sea-men, or keep them together; and that one Victory at Land, of which there was no <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> doubt, would re&s;tore him to his Dominion at Sea, and to what&s;oever had been unju&s;tly taken from his Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>

However, that all the world may &s;ee how willing his Maje&s;ty would be to embrace any over|ture, that might beget a right under&s;tanding between Him, and his two Hou&s;es of Parliament (with whom, he is &s;ure, he &s;hall have no contention, when the private practices, and &s;ubtle in&s;inuations of &s;ome few Malignant Per&s;ons &s;hall be di&s;covered; which his Maje&s;ty will take care &s;hall be &s;peedily done) he hath, with great care, weighed the Particulars of this Petition,</Q> and returns this An&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT the Petitioners were never unhappy in their Petitions or <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Supplications to his Maje&s;ty, while they de&s;ired any thing which was nece&s;&s;ary, or convenient for the pre&s;ervation of God's true Religion; his Maje&s;ty's Safety, and Honour; and the Peace of the Kingdom: And therefore, when tho&s;e general envious Foundations are laid, his Maje&s;ty could wi&s;h &s;ome particular In&s;tances had been applied. Let Envy and Malice object one particular Propo&s;ition for the pre&s;ervation of God's true Religion which his Maje&s;ty hath refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to; what Him&s;elf hath often made, for the ea&s;e of tender Con&s;ciences, and for the advancement of the Prote&s;tant Religion, is notorious by many of his Me&s;&s;ages and Declarations. What regard hath been to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> his Honour and Safety, when he hath been driven from &s;ome of his Hou&s;es, and kept from other of his Towns by Force: And what care there hath been of the Peace of the Kingdom, when endeavours have been u&s;ed to put all his Subjects in Armes again&s;t him, is &s;o evident, that, his Maje&s;ty is confident, he cannot &s;uffer by tho&s;e general Impu|tations. It is enough that the world knows what he hath granted, and what he hath denied.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;FOR his Maje&s;ty's rai&s;ing Forces, and making Preparations for War (what&s;oever the Petitioners, by the evil Arts of the Enemies to his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government, and by the calumnies, and &s;lan|ders <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> rai&s;ed again&s;t his Maje&s;ty by them, are induced to believe) all Men may know what is done that way, is but in order to his own de|fence. Let the Petitioners remember, that (which all the world
<PB N="533" REF="5510">
knows) his Maje&s;ty was driven from his Palace of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> for &s;afety of his Life: That both Hou&s;es of Parliament, upon their own Authority, rai&s;ed a Guard to them&s;elves (having gotten the Com|mand of all the Traind-bands of <HI>London</HI> to that purpo&s;e) without the lea&s;t colour, or &s;hadow of danger: That they u&s;urped a power, by their pretended Ordinance, again&s;t all Principles and Elements of Law, over the whole Militia of the Kingdom, without, and again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's con&s;ent: That they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Town, Fort, and Ma|gazine of <HI>Hull,</HI> and committed the &s;ame to S^r <HI>John Hotham;</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;hut the Gates again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and, by Force of Armes, denied entrance thither to his own Per&s;on: That they ju&s;tified this Act which they had not directed; and took S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> into their protection for what&s;oever he had done, or &s;hould do, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty. And all this, whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty had no other attendance than his own Me|nial Servants. Upon this, the Duty, and Affection of this County, prompted his Subjects here to provide a &s;mall Guard for his own Per|&s;on; which was no &s;ooner done, but a Vote &s;uddainly pa&s;&s;ed of his Maje&s;ty's intention to levy War again&s;t his Parliament (which, God knows, his heart abhorreth) and notwith&s;tanding all his Maje&s;ty's Pro|fe&s;&s;ions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> Declarations, and Prote&s;tations to the contrary, &s;econded by the clear Te&s;timony of &s;o great a Number of Peers upon the place, Propo&s;itions and Orders for Levies of Men, Hor&s;e, and Armes, were &s;ent throughout the Kingdom; Plate and Money brought in, and re|ceived; Hor&s;e and Men rai&s;ed towards an Army, Mu&s;tered, and under Command; and all this contrary to the Law, and to his Maje&s;ties Pro|clamation: And a Declaration publi&s;hed, that if he &s;hould u&s;e Force for the recovery of <HI>Hull,</HI> or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the pretended Ordi|nance for the Militia, it &s;hould be held levying War again&s;t the Par|liament: And all this done, before his Maje&s;ty granted any Commi&s;&s;ion <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> for the levying, or rai&s;ing a Man. His Maje&s;ty's Ships were taken from him, and committed to the cu&s;tody of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> who pre&s;umes, under that power, to u&s;urp to him&s;elf the Soveraignty of the Sea, to cha&s;e, fright, and impri&s;on &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's good Subjects, as de&s;ire to obey his Lawful Commands; altho' he had notice of the legal Revocation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiral,</Q> whereby all power derived from that Commi&s;&s;ion cea&s;ed.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;LET all the world now judge who begun this War, and upon who&s;e account the mi&s;eries, which may follow, mu&s;t be ca&s;t; what his Ma|je&s;ty could have done le&s;s than he hath done; and whether he were <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> not compelled to make provi&s;ion, both for the defence of him&s;elf, and recovery of what is &s;o violently, and injuriou&s;ly taken from him; and whether the&s;e injuries, and indignities, are not ju&s;t grounds for his Maje&s;ty's fears and apprehen&s;ions of further mi&s;chief, and danger to him. Whence the fears and jealou&s;ies of the Petitioners have pro|ceeded, hath never been di&s;covered; the dangers they have brought upon his Subjects are too evident; what tho&s;e are they have pre|vented, no Man knows. And therefore his Maje&s;ty cannot but look upon that Charge as the bolde&s;t, and the mo&s;t &s;candalous, hath been yet laid upon him; That this nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, made for his own <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> &s;afety and defence, is to over rule the Judgment, and Advice of his Great Council; and by force to determine the Que&s;tions there de|pending, concerning the Government and Liberty of the Kingdom.

<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> THE whole Court, upon the hearing that Petition from the two Hou&s;es read, expre&s;&s;ed a marvellous Indignation at the intolerable In|dignities offer'd to the King by it; and &s;eem'd no better &s;atisfied with the Me&s;&s;engers; who had profe&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they brought an ab&s;olute &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty;</Q> when, in truth, what they brought, appeared to be a full Ju&s;tification of what&s;oever they had done before, and an im|plied Threat of doing wor&s;e, and fixing all the &s;candals upon his Maje&s;ty, which they had &s;catter&punc;d abroad before: in&s;omuch that all Men expected, and believed his Maje&s;ty to be engaged, for the vindication of his Prince|ly <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> dignity and honour, to return a much &s;harper An&s;wer to them, than he had ever &s;ent. So that, when this which is before &s;et down (and which had before been con&s;ented to, and approved in the full A&s;&s;embly of the Peers, and Coun&s;ellors) was read publickly, it was generally thought, that the King had not enough re&s;ented the In&s;olence, and U&s;urpation of the Parliament; or appear&punc;d &s;en&s;ible enough of the Provocations: Yet the thought of a War, which wi&s;e Men &s;aw actually levied upon the King already, was &s;o much abhorred, and Men were &s;o credulous of every Expedient which was pretended for Peace, that, by the next morn|ing (the An&s;wer being deliver'd in the evening) the&s;e active Me&s;&s;engers <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> for the Parliament per&s;waded many <Q>&startq;&endq;that the King's An&s;wer was too &s;harp, and would provoke the Hou&s;es, who were natually pa&s;&s;ionate, to proceed in the high ways they were in; whereas, if the King would abate that &s;everity of Language, and would yet take off the Preamble of his An&s;wer, they were confident, and the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> privately offer'd to undertake, that &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given to all that his Maje&s;ty propo&s;ed.</Q> And, by this means, &s;ome were &s;o far wrought upon, as they earne&s;tly importuned the King, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would take his An&s;wer, which he had publickly delivered the night before, from the Me&s;&s;en|gers; and, in&s;tead thereof, return only the Matter of his own Propo&s;i|tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> in the mo&s;t &s;oft and gentle Language; without the Preamble, or any mention of the unju&s;tifiable, and unrea&s;onable demeanour of the Parliament towards him.</Q></P>

great provocations, and their fir&s;t general Remon&s;trance to the People, treated with all imaginable complyance, and lenity of words with them; and di&s;cover'd their unju&s;tifiable and extravagant proceedings with and again&s;t him, and the con&s;equences that would inevitably attend their Progre&s;s in them, with &s;uch tender expre&s;&s;ions, as if he be|lieved whatever was ami&s;s to proceed from mi&s;information only, and unskilful mi&s;takes: That this gentlene&s;s, and regard of his, was &s;o far from operating upon them, that their In&s;olence, and Irregularities in|crea&s;ed; and it might be from that rea&s;on, that their Me&s;&s;ages and De|clarations were writ in &s;o high a Dialect, and with that Soveraignty of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Language, as if He were &s;ubject to Their juri&s;diction; and did not know but it might have &s;ome influence upon his People to his di&s;ad|vantage, that is, rai&s;e terrour towards Them, and le&s;&s;en their reverence towards his Maje&s;ty, when all Their Petitions and Propo&s;itions were more Imperative than His ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary Refu&s;als: Which con|de&s;cen&s;ion his Maje&s;ty had brought him&s;elf to, in hope, that His exam|ple, and Their natural &s;hame, would have reform&punc;d that new Licence of words: That this la&s;t Addre&s;s, under the name of a Petition (a few days after they had violently ravi&s;hed his whole Fleet from him; and prepared the &s;ame day, that they had cho&s;en a General, to whom they <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> had &s;worn Alleg$ance, to lead an Army again&s;t him) contained a perem|tory Ju&s;tification of what&s;oever they had done; and as peremtory a Threatning of what&s;oever they could do: and therefore, if he &s;hould Now retract his An&s;wer, which had been &s;olemnly con&s;ider'd in Coun|cil, before all the Peers, and which in truth implied rather a Princely re&s;entment of the Indignities offer'd to him, than flow d with any &s;harp or bitter Expre&s;&s;ions, he &s;hould, by &s;uch yielding, give encouragement to New attempts; and could not but much di&s;courage tho&s;e, upon who&s;e Affections and Loyalty he was principally to depend; who could not think it &s;afe to rai&s;e them&s;elves to an indignation on his behalf, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> when He expre&s;&s;ed &s;o tender, or &s;o little &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ufferings: be&s;ides, that he was then upon an avowed Ho&s;tile enterpri&s;e for the re|duction of <HI>Hull;</HI> towards which he was to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to draw a Force together, equal to that De&s;ign; and by &s;uch a Retraction as this propo&s;ed, and a &s;eeming declen&s;ion of his Spirit, and depending upon their good natures, who had done all this mi&s;chief, he &s;hould not only be inevitably di&s;appointed of the re&s;ort of new &s;trength, but, pro|bably, de&s;erted by tho&s;e few, whom he had brought together: That he could not rea&s;onably, or excu&s;ably depend upon the undertaking of the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> who had &s;o gro&s;ly deceived him in other under|takings, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> which were immediately in his own power to have perform'd: whereas neither he, nor either of the other two Gentlemen, who were joyn&punc;d with him in this imployment, had &s;o much intere&s;t with the Active and Prevailing Party, as to know more of their Intentions than was at pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;cover'd for their Concurrence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;HE &s;aid, that he had never yet con&s;ented to any one Particular, &s;ince the beginning of this Parliament, by which he had received prejudice, at the doing whereof he had not the &s;olemn undertakings and promi&s;es of tho&s;e, who were much abler to ju&s;tify their undertakings, than the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> and upon whom he only depended, that it &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> no di&s;&s;ervice to him, and would be an infallible means to compa&s;s all that his Maje&s;ty de&s;ired: But he had allways found tho&s;e Promi&s;ers and Undertakers, tho' they could eminently carry on any Coun&s;el, or
<PB N="539" REF="5570">
Conclu&s;ion, that was again&s;t Law, Ju&s;tice, or His Right, had never power to reduce, or re&s;train tho&s;e agitations within any bounds of So|briety, and moderation: And when they found, that many would not be guided by them, that they might &s;eem &s;till to Lead, them&s;elves as furiou&s;ly Followed the other; and re&s;orted again to his Maje&s;ty with &s;ome new Expedient, as de&s;tructive as the former. So that he was re|&s;olved to rely upon God Allmighty, and not &s;o much to depend upon what might po&s;&s;ibly prevail upon the Affections of tho&s;e, from whom, rea&s;onably, he could not expect any good, as upon &s;uch plain and avow'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> cour&s;es, as, let the &s;ucce&s;s be what it would, mu&s;t, to all judging Men, appear to be prudently, and honourably relied on: And therefore he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to make the lea&s;t alteration in his An&s;wer.</Q> And &s;o the Me&s;&s;engers departed, leaving the Court and Country wor&s;e affected, than they found it; and branding &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, whom they found le&s;s inclined to be ruled by their profe&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es, <Q>&startq;&endq;as the Authors of a Civil War:</Q> And making them as odious as they could, where ever they came.</P>
<P>AND &s;ure, from that time, the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was more tran&s;ported from his natural temper and gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, into pa&s;&s;ion and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> animo&s;ity again&s;t the King, and his Mini&s;ters; and, having been nothing plea&s;ed with his own condition at <HI>London,</HI> finding the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> (whom he did not &s;ecretly love, and did indeed contemn) to draw all Men's Eyes towards him, and to have the greate&s;t Intere&s;t in their hearts, he had &s;eriou&s;ly intended, under colour of this Me&s;&s;age to the King, to di&s;cover if there were any &s;parks yet left in his Royal brea&s;t, which might be kindled into affection, or acceptation of his Service; and hoped, if he could get any credit, to redeem his former tre&s;pa&s;&s;es: But when he not only found his Maje&s;ty cold towards him, but ea&s;ily enough di&s;cern'd, by his reception, that all former inclinations were dead, and more than or|dinary <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> prejudices grown up towards him in their places, and that his ad|vices were rejected, he return'd with rancour equal to the mo&s;t furious he went to; and heartily joyn'd and concurr'd towards the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing that Power, in the Admini&s;tration whereof he was not like to bear any part.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty having, by his An&s;wer, obliged him&s;elf not to make any forcible Attempt upon <HI>Hull</HI> till the 27^t^h of <HI>July,</HI> by which time he might rea&s;onably expect an An&s;wer to his Propo&s;itions, in the mean time re|&s;olved to make &s;ome &s;hort progre&s;s into the neighbour Counties; and accordingly, the &s;ame day the Me&s;&s;engers departed, the King went to <HI>Donca&s;ter;</HI> the next day to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> where <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> he heard, the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and &s;ome other Parliament Men, were executing the Ordinance of the Militia: But, before his Maje&s;ty came thither, they removed them&s;elves to <HI>Northampton;</HI> a Town &s;o true to them, as, if they had been purfued, would have &s;hut their Gates again&s;t the King Him&s;elf, as <HI>Hull</HI> had done.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> the King was received, with great expre&s;&s;ions of Duty and Loyalty, by the appearance of the Traind-bands, and full Acclama|tions of the People; yet there were two Accidents that Happen'd there, which, if they be at all remember'd, will manife&s;t, that if the King were Loved there as he ought to be, that the Parliament was more Fear'd than <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> He. It happen'd to be at the time of the general A&s;&s;izes, and Ju&s;tice <HI>Reeve</HI> (a Man of a good reputation for Learning, and Integrity; and who, in good times, would have been a good Judge) &s;ate there as judge; and M^r <HI>Henry Ha&s;tings,</HI> younger Son to the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> was purpo&s;ely
<PB N="540" REF="5580">
made high Sheriff, to contain the County within the limits of their duty by the power of that Office, as well as by the Intere&s;t, and Relation of his Family. The Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, had departed the Town but few hours before his Maje&s;ty's entrance; and had left their Magazine, which was indeed the Magazine of the County, in a little Store-Hou&s;e at the end of the Town, guarded by &s;ome inferior Officers whom they had brought down to Train and Exerci&s;e the Militia, and other Zealous and devoted Men of the County, in all to about the Num|ber of 25, who had barricadoed the door of the Hou&s;e; and profe&s;&s;ed <Q>&startq;&endq;to keep it again&s;t ail demanders;</Q> having provi&s;ions within it of all &s;orts. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> The King was very unwilling (coming in &s;o peaceable a manner, at &s;o peaceable a time) to take any notice of it. On the other hand, it was an Act of too great in&s;olence to be &s;uffer'd; and, upon the matter, to leave a Garri&s;on of the Rebels in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town; and therefore he &s;ent word to the Judge, <Q>&startq;&endq;that if He took not &s;ome legal way to remove &s;uch a Force &s;o near his Maje&s;ty, his Maje&s;ty would do it in &s;ome Extraor|dinary cour&s;e:</Q> Which, upon the &s;uddain, would have puzled him to have done; having neither Soldier, Cannon, nor Powder to effect it; the want of which as much troubled the Sheriff In the end, the Gentlemen of the Country, who had not yet otherwi&s;e declared them&s;elves on either <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> &s;ide, than by waiting on his Maje&s;ty, finding that the King would not go from the Town, till that Nui&s;ance was removed; and that it might bring Inconveniences, Charge, and Mi&s;chief to the County of a high na|ture; &s;o prevailed, that, as his Maje&s;ty was contented to take no notice of it, &s;o they within the Hou&s;e, in the night, upon a&s;&s;urance of Safety, and Liberty to go whither they would, removed and left the Hou&s;e; and &s;o that matter was quieted.</P>
<P>THE other Accident was, or was like to have proved, more Ridicu|lous: Some of the King's Servants, hearing that the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and the other Militia Men were newly gone out of the Town, had of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Them&s;elves, coming thither before the King, galloped after them; in|tending to have apprehended them, and brought them before the King; and, tho&punc; the other were too fleet for them, had, in the way, overtaken D^r <HI>Ba&s;twick,</HI> a Man well known, who had been a principal Officer with them at <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and fled at the &s;ame time, but could not keep pace with his Commanders: Him they brought to the Town, where, by the Sheriff, he was committed to Pri&s;on; having confe&s;&s;ed enough Trea&s;on, and ju&s;tifying it, as would have ju&s;tly hanged any Subject. The King thought once to have had him indicted then, at the A&s;&s;izes, upon the plain Statute of 25 <HI>E.</HI> III. But the Judge be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty not to put a mat|ter <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of &s;o great moment, upon which the power of the two Hou&s;es of Par|liament, and a Parliament &s;itting, mu&s;t be determin'd, before one &s;ingle Judge, who&s;e reputation was not enough to bear &s;o great a burthen; how|ever, he declared his own opinion fully to his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was Trea|&s;on; which, he believed, all the other Judges mu&s;t acknowledge; and if convened together by his Maje&s;ty to that purpo&s;e, he thought a joynt Declaration, and Re&s;olution of all together might be of great u&s;e to the King; whereas the publi&s;hing of His particular opinion could only de|&s;troy him&s;elf, and nothing advance his Maje&s;ty's Service: Be&s;ides, he had no rea&s;on to be &s;o confident of the Country, as to conclude that a <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Jury, then &s;uddainly &s;ummon'd, would have the courage to find the Bill; and then their Not doing it, if it were attempted, would prove a greater countenance to the Ordinance, than the Votes of the two Hou&s;es had
<PB N="541" REF="5590">
yet given it.</Q> This la&s;t rea&s;on gave his Maje&s;ty &s;atisfaction; &s;o that he was contented that the fellow &s;hould be kept in Pri&s;on, and the Tryal be deferred, till he could conveniently &s;ummon more Judges to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty was no &s;ooner per&s;waded to be content that this pro&s;e|cution might be &s;u&s;pended, but the clo&s;e Agents for the Parliament's Ser|vice, who were not yet di&s;over'd, but appear'd very intire to the King, &s;o dextrou&s;ly carried them&s;elves, that they prevailed with tho&s;e Gen|tlemen of the Country, who&s;e Zeal to his Maje&s;ty was mo&s;t eminent and unque&s;tionable, and even with the Judge him&s;elf, <Q>&startq;&endq;to wi&s;h, that his Ma|je&s;ty <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> would freely and graciou&s;ly di&s;charge the D^r of his Impri&s;onment; or give the Judge leave to do &s;o upon a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI></Q> (which he was advi&s;ed to require) <Q>&startq;&endq;And that it would be &s;uch an Act of Mercy, and &s;ingular Ju&s;tice, that would not only work upon the People of That County to his Maje&s;ty's advantage, but mu&s;t have a great influence upon the whole Kingdom,</Q> and even upon the Parliament it &s;elf. And with this &s;trange de&s;ire the good Judge, and tho&s;e principal Gentlemen, confidently came to the King, the night before he intended to return Northward. His Maje&s;ty told them, <Q>&startq;&endq;he would think of it till the next morning.</Q> And, in the mean time, concluding by what he heard, that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> tho' he &s;hould refu&s;e to di&s;charge him, or to con&s;ent that he &s;hould be di&s;|charged, his re&s;traint would not be long in that place after His departure, the People allready re&s;orting to him with great Licen&s;e, and the D^$, ac|cording to his Nature, talking &s;editiou&s;ly and loudly, he directed <Q>&startq;&endq;a Me&s;|&s;enger of the Chamber very early, with &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance as the Sheriff &s;hould give him, to carry him away to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and, by the help of that Sheriff,</Q> to the Goal at <HI>York:</HI> Which was executed accordingly with expedition, and &s;ecrecy; if either of which had been ab&s;ent, it is certain the Common People had re&s;cued him; which, of how trivial a moment &s;oever it &s;hall be thought, I could not but mention as an In&s;tance <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> of the Spirit and Temper of that time, and the great Di&s;advantage the King was upon, that &s;o many very good Men thought fit, at a time, when very many hundreds of Per&s;ons of Honour, and Quality, were impri|&s;on'd with all &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity by the Parliament, upon the bare &s;u&s;pition that they meant to go to the King, or that they wi&s;hed well to him, or for not &s;ubmitting to &s;ome illegal Order, or Command of Theirs, that the King &s;hould di&s;charge an infamous Per&s;on, taken in an Act of High-Trea&s;on, and who more frankly, and avowedly profe&s;&s;ed &s;edition, than he did the Science of which he pretended to be Doctor.</P>
<P>THE King, according to his appointment, return'd towards <HI>Hull,</HI> in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> expectation of an An&s;wer from the Parliament; which came two days after the appointed day, but with no &s;olemnity of Me&s;&s;engers, or other ceremony, than inclo&s;ed to one of the Secretaries to be pre&s;ented to the King; in which they told him,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ments Repli|cation <HI>July26 1642.</HI></NOTE> <Q>&startq;&endq;THAT they could not, for the pre&s;ent, with the di&s;charge of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them for the &s;afety of the King and Kingdom, yield to tho&s;e Demands of his Maje&s;ty: The rea&s;on why they took into their cu&s;tody the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> the Magazine, and Navy; pa&s;&s;ed the Ordi|nance of the Militia; and made preparation of Armes; was for &s;ecurity of Religion, the &s;afety of his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, of the Kingdom, and Par|liament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> all which they did &s;ee in evident, and imminent danger; from which when they &s;hould be &s;ecured, and that the Forces of the King|dom &s;hould not be u&s;ed to the de&s;truction thereof, they &s;hould then be ready to withdraw the Garri&s;on out of <HI>Hull;</HI> to deliver the Magazine
<PB N="542" REF="5600">
and Navy; and &s;ettle the Militia, by Bill, in &s;uch a way as &s;hould be ho|nourable and &s;afe for his Maje&s;ty; mo&s;t agreeable to the duty of Parlia|ment; and effectual for the good of the Kingdom; as they had pro|fe&s;&s;ed in their late Petition. And for Adjourning the Parliament, they apprehended no rea&s;on for his Maje&s;ty to require it; nor &s;ecurity for them&s;elves to con&s;ent to it. And as for that rea&s;on which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s, they doubted not but the U&s;ual place would be as &s;afe for his Royal Per&s;on, as any other; con&s;idering the full A&s;&s;urance they had of the Loyalty, and Fidelity of the City of <HI>London</HI> to his Ma|je&s;ty; and the care which his Parliament would ever have to prevent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> any danger, which his Maje&s;ty might ju&s;tly apprehend; be&s;ides the manifold conveniences to be had there, beyond any other parts of the Kingdom. And as for the laying down of Armes; when the cau&s;es which moved them to provide for the defence of his Maje&s;ty, the Kingdom, and Parliament, &s;hould be taken away, they &s;hould very willingly, and chearfully forbear any further Preparations, and lay down their Force allready rai&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH Replication, as they called it, to his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer, they order'd <Q>&startq;&endq;to be Printed, and read in all Churches, and Chappels within the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI></Q> and Dominion of <HI>Wales.</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>AND &s;o the War was now denounced, by their expre&s;s Words, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty; as it had been long before in their Actions; and both Par|ties &s;eem'd to give over all thoughts of further Treaties, and Overtures; and each prepared to make them&s;elves con&s;iderable by the &s;trength, and power of &s;uch Forces, as they could draw together.</P>
<P>IN <HI>London</HI> they intended nothing but the forming of their Army, and &s;uch other things of power, as were in order thereunto. To that purpo&s;e, the Bill for the payment of Tonnage and Poundage being expired, on the fir&s;t day of <HI>July,</HI> and they having &s;ent another of the &s;ame nature to the King for his con&s;ent, for &s;ix Months longer, his Maje&s;ty, &s;ince he &s;aw <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> That, and all other Money properly belonging to him, violently taken from him, and imployed by them again&s;t him, refu&s;ed to give his Royal A&s;&s;ent thereunto: Whereupon, without the lea&s;t hae&s;itation (albeit it had been enacted this very Parliament, <Q>&startq;&endq;that who&s;oever &s;hould pre&s;ume to pay, or receive that duty, after the expiration of the Act, before the &s;ame was regranted to his Maje&s;ty with the con&s;ent of the Lords and Commons,</Q> &s;hould be in a Praemunire; which is the heavie&s;t puni&s;h|ment inflicted by Law, but the lo&s;s of Life) they appointed, and or|der'd by the Power of the two Hou&s;es (which they called an Ordinance of Parliament) <Q>&startq;&endq;that the &s;ame duty &s;hould be continued; and declared <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> that they would &s;ave all Per&s;ons concern'd, from any Penalty or Pu|ni&s;hment what&s;oever:</Q> By which they now became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Cu&s;toms, in their own right.</P>
<P>TOWARDS &s;uch, as any ways (tho' under the obligation of Oaths or Offices) oppo&s;ed, or di&s;countenanced what they went about, they pro|ceeded with the mo&s;t extravagant &s;everity, that had been ever heard of; of which I &s;hall only mention two In&s;tances; the Fir&s;t, of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> S^r <HI>Richard Gurney,</HI> a Citizen of great Wealth, Repu|tation and Integrity; whom the Lords had, upon the complaint of the Hou&s;e of Commons, before their &s;ending the la&s;t Petition to the King (of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> which his Maje&s;ty gave them a touch in his An&s;wer) committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> for cau&s;ing the King's Proclamation again&s;t the Mili|tia, by vertue of his Maje&s;ty's Writ to him directed, and according to the

known Duty of this Place, to be publickly proclaim&punc;d. And &s;hortly after, that they might have a Man more compliant with their de&s;igns to go|vern the City, notwith&s;tanding that he in&s;i&s;ted upon his innocence, and made it appear that he was obliged by the Laws of the Land, the Cu&s;toms of the City, and the Con&s;titution of his Office, and his Oath, to do what|&s;oever he had done; He was by their Lord&s;hips, in the pre&s;ence of the Commons, adjudged <Q>&startq;&endq;to be put out of his Office of Lord Mayor of <HI>Lon|don;</HI> to be utterly incapable of bearing Office in City or Kingdom, and of all Honour or Dignity; and to be impri&s;on&punc;d, during the plea&s;ure of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> the two Hou&s;es of Parliament.</Q> And, upon this &s;entence, Alderman <HI>Pennington,</HI> &s;o often before mention&punc;d, was, by the noi&s;e and clamour of the Common People, again&s;t the Cu&s;toms and Rules of Election, made Mayor; and accordingly in&s;talled; and the true, old, worthy Mayor committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> where, with notable courage and con&s;tancy, he continued almo&s;t to his Death.</P>
<P>THE other In&s;tance, I think fit to mention, is that of Judge <HI>Mallet;</HI> who, as is before remember&punc;d, was committed to the Tower the la&s;t Lent, for having &s;een a Petition prepared by the grand Jury of <HI>Kent,</HI> for the Countenance of the Book of Common Prayer, and again&s;t the impo&s;ition <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of the Militia by Ordinance without the Royal A&s;&s;ent. This Judge (being this Summer Circuit, again Judge of A&s;&s;ize for tho&s;e Counties) &s;itting at <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> upon the great A&s;&s;ize, &s;ome members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, under the &s;tyle and title of a Committee of Parliament, came to the Bench; and, producing &s;ome Votes, and Orders, and Declarations of one or both Hou&s;es, <Q>&startq;&endq;required him, in the name of the Parliament, to cau&s;e tho&s;e Papers (being on the behalf of the Ordinance of the Militia, and again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array) "to be read. He told them, "that he fat there by vertue of his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ions; and that he was authorized to do any thing compri&s;ed in tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions; but he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> had no Authority to do any thing el&s;e; and therefore, there being no mention, in either of his Commi&s;&s;ions, of tho&s;e Papers, or the Publi&s;hing any thing of that nature,</Q> he could not, nor would not do it; and &s;o (finding le&s;s re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than they expected, both to their Per|&s;ons and their Bu&s;ine&s;s, from the Learned Judge, and that the whole County, at lea&s;t the prime Gentlemen and the Grand Jury, which repre|&s;ented the County, contemn&punc;d both much more) this Committee return'd to the Hou&s;e with great exclamations again&s;t M^r Ju&s;tice <HI>Mallet,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;as the Fomenter and Protector of a Malignant Faction again&s;t the Parliament.</Q> And, upon this Charge, a Troop of Hor&s;e was &s;ent to attend an Officer; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> who came with a Warrant from the Hou&s;es, or &s;ome Committee (whereas Ju&s;tice <HI>Mallet,</HI> being an A&s;&s;i&s;tant of the Hou&s;e of Peers, could not Regu|larly be &s;ummon&punc;d by any other Authority) to <HI>King&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where the Judge was keeping the general A&s;&s;izes for that County; and, to the un&s;peakable Di&s;honour of the Publick Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom, and the Scandal of all Mini&s;ters or Lovers of Ju&s;tice, in that violent manner took the Judge from the Bench, and carried him Pri&s;oner to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> from whence, by the two Hou&s;es, he was committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> where he remain'd for the &s;pace of above two years, without ever being charged with any particular Crime, till he was redeem'd by his Maje&s;ty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> by the exchange of another, who&s;e liberty they de&s;ired.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e heightned Acts of Power and Terrour, they quickly demon|&s;trated, how un&s;ecure it would be for any Man, at lea&s;t not to concur with them. And, having a General, Armes, Money, and Men enough at
<PB N="544" REF="5620">
their devotion, they ea&s;ily form'd an Army, publickly di&s;po&s;ing &s;uch Troops and Regiments, as had been rai&s;ed for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and, at one time, one hunder'd thou&s;and pounds of that Money, which, by Act of Parlia|ment, had been paid for that purpo&s;e, towards the con&s;tituting that Army, which was to be led again&s;t their Lawful Soveraign. So that it was very evident, they would be in &s;uch an Equipage within few Weeks, both with a Train of Artillery, Hor&s;e and Foot, all taken, arm'd, furni&s;hed, and &s;upplied out of his Maje&s;ty's own Magazines and Stores, that they had not rea&s;on to fear any oppo&s;ition. In the mean time, they declared, and publi&s;hed to the People, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they rai&s;ed that Army, only for the de|fence <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> of the Parliament, the King's Per&s;on, and the Religion, Liberty, and Laws of the Kingdom, and of tho&s;e, who, for Their &s;akes, and for tho&s;e Ends, had obeyed their Orders: That the King, by the in&s;tigation of evil Coun&s;ellors, had rai&s;ed a great Army of Papi&s;ts; by which he intended to awe, and de&s;troy the Parliament; to introduce Popery, and Tyranny: Of which intention, they &s;aid, his requiring <HI>Hull;</HI> his &s;end|ing out Commi&s;&s;ions of Array&punc; be&s;peaking Armes and Ammunition beyond the Seas (there having been &s;ome brought to him by the Ship called the Providence) his declaring S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> Traytor; and the putting out the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> from being Lord High-Admi|ral <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of <HI>England;</HI> his removing the Earl of <HI>Pembroke, E&s;&s;ex, Holland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Fielding,</HI> and S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> from their &s;everal places and imployments&punc; were &s;ufficient and ample evidences: And therefore, they conjured all Men,</Q> to a&s;&s;i&s;t their General, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> And, for their better and more &s;ecret tran&s;action of all &s;uch Coun&s;els, as were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be enter'd upon, or follow'd, they made a Committee, of &s;ome choice Members of either Hou&s;e, to intend the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the King|dom with reference to the Army; who had Authority, without &s;o much as communicating the matter to the Hou&s;e, to impri&s;on Per&s;ons, &s;ei&s;e upon their E&s;tates; and many other Particulars, which the two <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;es, in full Parliament, had not the lea&s;t Regular, Legal, Ju&s;tifiable Authority to do. And, for the better encouragement of Men to engage in the Service, the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, formerly accu&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty of High-Trea&s;on, upon &s;o|lemn debate, had &s;everal Regiments conferr'd on them; and, by their example&punc; many other Members of both Hou&s;es, &s;ome upon their lowne&s;s, and decaiedne&s;s of their Fortunes, others to get name and reputation to be in the number of Reformers (among&s;t whom they doubted not all Places of Honour, or Offices of profit, would be be&s;towed) mo&s;t upon the confidence, that all would be ended without a Blow, by the King's want <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> of power to gather &s;trength, de&s;ired and obtain'd Command of Hor&s;e or Foot; their Quality making amends for their want of experience, and their other defects; which were repaired by many good Officers both Engli&s;h, and Scots; the late Troubles having brought many of that tribe to <HI>London,</HI> and the reputation of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> having drawn others, out of the Low-Countries, to engage in that Service, In the choice of which Officers, whil&s;t they accu&s;ed the King of a purpo&s;e to bring a For|reign Force, and of entertaining Papi&s;ts, they neither con&s;ider'd Nation nor Religion; but entertain'd all Strangers, and Forreigners, of what Religion &s;oever, who de&s;ired to run their Fortune in the War. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"></P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, Preparations were not made with equal expedition, and &s;ucce&s;s by the King, towards a War: For, tho' he well under&s;tood, and di&s;cern'd, that he had nothing el&s;e to tru&s;t to, he was to encounter
<PB N="545" REF="5630">
&s;trange Difficulties to do that. He was &s;o far from having Money to levy, or pay Soldiers, that he was, at this very time, compelled, for very real want, to let fall all the Tables kept by his Officers of State in Court, by which &s;o many of all qualities &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and the Prince, and Duke of <HI>York,</HI> eat with his Maje&s;ty; which Table only was kept. And whoever knows the Con&s;titution of a Court, well knows what indi&s;po&s;itions natu|rally flow from tho&s;e declen&s;ions; and how ill tho&s;e Tempers bear any diminution of their own Intere&s;ts; and, being once indi&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves, how ea&s;ily they infect others. And that which made the pre&s;ent want of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Money the more intolerable, there was no vi&s;ible hope from whence &s;up|ply could come, in any rea&s;onable time: And that which was a greater want than Money, which Men rather fear'd than found, there were no Armes; for, notwith&s;tanding the fame of the great Store of Ammunition, brought in by that Ship, it con&s;i&s;ted only in truth of Cannon, Powder, and Bullet, with eight hundred Mu&s;quets, which was all the King's Ma|gazine. So that the ha&s;tning of Levies, which at that time was believed would not prove difficult, would be to little purpo&s;e, when they &s;hould continue unarm'd. But that which troubled the King more than all the&s;e real incapacities of making War, was the temper and con&s;titution of his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> own Party; which was compounded, for the mo&s;t part, in Court, Coun|cil, and Country, of Men drawn to him by the impul&s;ion of Con&s;cience, and abhorring the unju&s;t and irregular proceedings of the Parliament; otherwi&s;e unexperienced in Action, and unacquainted with the My&s;teries, and nece&s;&s;ary Policy of Government; &s;evere ob&s;ervers of the Law, and as &s;crupulous in all matters relating to it, as the other pretended to be. All his Maje&s;ty's Ancient Coun&s;ellors, and Servants (except &s;ome few of la&s;ting Honour, whom We &s;hall have occa&s;ion often to mention) that they might redeem former over&s;ights, or for other unworthy de&s;igns, being either publickly again&s;t him in <HI>London,</HI> or privately di&s;crediting his In|tere&s;t <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> and Actions, in his own Court. The&s;e Men &s;till urged <Q>&startq;&endq;the execu|tion of the Law; that what extravagances &s;oever the Parliament pra|cticed, the King's ob&s;ervation of the Law would, in the end, &s;uppre&s;s them all.</Q> And, indeed, believed the rai&s;ing a War to be &s;o wicked a thing, that they thought it impo&s;&s;ible the Parliament &s;hould intend it, even when they knew what they were doing. However they concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he, that was forwarde&s;t in the preparing an Army, would be fir&s;t odious to the People; by the affections of whom, the other would be ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the general received Doctrine; and tho' it appear'd plainly <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> to others (of equal affection to the Publick Peace) how fatal tho&s;e Con|clu&s;ions, in that &s;en&s;e in which they were urged, mu&s;t prove to the whole Kingdom; and how &s;oon the King mu&s;t be irrecoverably lo&s;t, if he pro|ceeded not more vigorou&s;ly in his defence; yet even tho&s;e Men dur&s;t not, in any form'd and publick Debate, declare them&s;elves; or &s;peak that plain Engli&s;h the State of Affairs required; but &s;atisfied them&s;elves with &s;peak|ing, what they thought nece&s;&s;ary, to the King in Private; by which means the King wanted tho&s;e firm, and &s;olid foundations of Coun&s;el and Fore&s;ight, that were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for his condition: So that he could neither impart the true motives, and grounds of any important Action, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> nor di&s;cover the utmo&s;t of his De&s;igns. And &s;o he &s;till &s;eem'd (notwith|&s;tanding the greate&s;t, and avow'd preparations of the Enemy) to intend nothing of Ho&s;tility, but in order to the reducing of <HI>Hull;</HI> the benefit of which, he hoped, would engage the Train'd-bands of that great County (which was the &s;ole &s;trength he yet drew thither) till he could bring
<PB N="546" REF="5640">
other Forces thither, which might be fit for that, or any other De&s;ign.</P>
<P>BUT there was another Rea&s;on of his Maje&s;ty's going to, and &s;taying at <HI>Beverly,</HI> than was under&s;tood; and, it may be, if it had been known, might have produced a better Effect; which I think nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert in this place. The Lord <HI>`Digby,</HI> whom We have mention'd before, in the fir&s;t di&s;order, by which the King and Queen were driven from <HI>London,</HI> to have left <HI>England,</HI> and to be after unrea&s;onably accu&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons of High-Trea&s;on, had remain'd from that time in <HI>Holland;</HI> and, hearing the King's condition at <HI>York,</HI> to be &s;o much improved beyond what he left it at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> had, with &s;ome Commands from the Queen, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> arrived there very privately, and &s;tayed &s;ome days in a di&s;gui&s;e at <HI>York,</HI> revealing him&s;elf to very few Friends, and &s;peaking with the King in &s;o &s;ecret a manner in the night, that no notice was taken of his being there; and, finding the King's Affairs not in &s;o good a po&s;ture as he expected, and conceiving it yet not fit for him to appear, re&s;olved to return again to the Queen, and to ha&s;ten that provi&s;ion of Armes and Ammunition, without which it was not po&s;&s;ible for the King to re&s;i&s;t any violence, that threaten'd him; and &s;o, in the &s;ame Bark which brought him over, he went again to Sea for <HI>Holland,</HI> with <HI>Wilmot, A&s;hburnham, Pollard,</HI> and <HI>Berkley;</HI> who purpo&s;ely removed them&s;elves from Court, upon the cla|mour <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of the Parliament, till the King was ready to u&s;e their Service. They were not many hours at Sea, when they met the Providence (which We mention'd before) with the Ammunition, which was only wanted; and, well knowing her, they agreed, <Q>&startq;&endq;that <HI>Wilmot, Pollard</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> &s;hould return with the Ammunition to the King; and <HI>Digby,</HI> and Coll. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI></Q> &s;hould pur&s;ue their former Intentions for <HI>Holland.</HI> But their Parties continued &s;o long, that the Parliament Ships, who had watched and cha&s;ed the Providence, came up to them; and, tho' the Ship e&s;caped, and run on &s;hore, as was before mention'd, yet the Fly-boat, in which the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was, could not &s;o well get away; but was taken <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> by them, and carried in with &s;o much the more triumph into <HI>Hull,</HI> that they had been di&s;appointed of their greater Prize. Coll. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> tho' he was in great umbrage with the Parliament, and one of tho&s;e Delin|quents, whom they reproached the King with, was &s;o well known to S^r <HI>John Hotham,</HI> with whom he &s;tood in a good degree of familiarity, that he could not di&s;&s;emble or conceal him&s;elf; but the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> being in &s;o real a di&s;gui&s;e, that his neare&s;t friends would not ea&s;ily have known him, pretended to be a <HI>French</HI>-man, who&s;e Language he &s;poke excellent|ly; and &s;eem'd to be &s;o Sea-&s;ick, that he kept him&s;elf in the hole of the Bark, till they came to <HI>Hull;</HI> and, in that time, di&s;po&s;ed of &s;uch Papers, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> as were not fit to be peru&s;ed; and, when he came on Shore, &s;o well coun|terfeited &s;ickne&s;s, and want of health, that he ea&s;ily procured him&s;elf to be &s;ent, under a Guard, to &s;ome ob&s;cure corner for repo&s;e; whil&s;t Coll. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> who was the only Pri&s;oner they thought worth the look|ing after, was carefully carried to the Governour; who received him with as much Civility, as he could rea&s;onably expect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> THE Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> being by him&s;elf, quickly con&s;ider'd the de&s;perate|ne&s;s of his condition: <Q>&startq;&endq;That it would not be po&s;&s;ible to conceal him&s;elf long, being &s;o well known to many who were in the Providence, and the Garri&s;en quickly knowing what&s;oever was &s;poken of in the Coun|try: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> That he was, how unju&s;tly, or unrea&s;onably &s;oever, the mo&s;t odious Man of the Kingdom to the Parliament; into who&s;e hands if he &s;hould then come,</Q> his Life would be, at lea&s;t, in apparent hazard: And how to get him&s;elf out of that Labyrinth was very difficult, &s;ince S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI>
<PB N="547" REF="5650">
was &s;o far from any inclination of kindne&s;s towards him, as he had own'd to Coll. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> that he was in the Number of his mo&s;t notorious Enemies. However, in this eminent extremity (as he is a Man of the greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind, and the lea&s;t appalled upon danger, that I have known) he re&s;olved, not to give him&s;elf over; and found means to make one of his Guard, in broken Engli&s;h, which might well have become any French-man, under&s;tand, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he de&s;ired to &s;peak privately with the Governour; and that he would di&s;cover &s;ome Secrets of the King's, and Queen&punc;s to him, that would highly advance the Service of the Parlia|ment.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> The Fellow made ha&s;t to let the Governour know the&s;e good tidings; who, under&s;tanding French well, as &s;peedily &s;ent for the French|man; who was brought before him in the pre&s;ence of much company, and, without any di&s;order, gave &s;uch an account of him&s;elf, as they un|der&s;tood him to have &s;een much of the French Service of which he &s;poke very fluently) and to have come over recommended to the King for &s;ome Command, if he &s;hould have occa&s;ion to u&s;e Soldiers; as, he &s;aid, People abroad conceived him likely to have. After he had entertain'd the com|pany with &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e, there being pre&s;ent &s;ome Gentlemen, who came lately out of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o being the more curious to admini&s;ter <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> que&s;tions, he applied him&s;elf to the Governour; and told him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that if he might be admitted to privacy with him, he would di&s;cover &s;ome|what to him,</Q> which he would not repent to have known. The Gover|nour, who was a Man apt enough to fear his own &s;afety, but more appre|hen&s;ive of the Jealou&s;ies which would attend him (for his elde&s;t Son, and &s;ome others, were more ab&s;olutely confided in by the Parliament than him&s;elf, and were in truth, but Spies over him) would not venture him|&s;elf in another Room; but drew him to a great Window at a convenient di&s;tance from the company, and wi&s;hed him "to &s;ay what he thought fit. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> finding he could not obtain more privacy, asked him, in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> Engli&s;h, <Q>&startq;&endq;whether he know him? the other, &s;urpri&s;ed, told him, <HI>No;</HI> Then, &s;aid he, I &s;hall try whether I know S^r <HI>John Hotham;</HI> and whe|ther he be, in truth, the &s;ame Man of Honour, I have allways taken him to be: And, thereupon, told him who he was; and "that he hoped he was too much a Gentleman to deliver him up a &s;acrifice to Their rage and fury,</Q> who, he well knew, were his implacable Enemies. The other, be|ing a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;caring that the By-&s;tanders would di&s;cover him too (for, being now told who he was he wonder'd he found it not out Him&s;elf) he de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;&endq;to &s;ay no more for the pre&s;ent; that he &s;hould not be &s;orry for the tru&s;t he repo&s;ed in him, and &s;hould find him the &s;ame Man he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> had thought him&punc; That he would find &s;ome time, a&s;&s;oon as conveniently he might, to have more conference with him. In the mean time, that he &s;hould content him&s;elf with the ill accommodation he had; the amendment whereof would beget &s;u&s;picion: And &s;o he called the Guard, in&s;tantly to carry him away,</Q> and to have a very &s;trict Eye upon him; and, turning to the Company, and being con&s;cious to him&s;elf of the trou|ble and di&s;order in his Countenance, told them, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the French-man was a &s;hrew&punc;d Fellow, and under&s;tood more of the Queen's Coun&s;els and de&s;igns, than a Man would &s;u&s;pect: That he had told him that which the Parliament would be glad to know; to whom pre&s;ently he would <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> make a di&s;patch, tho' he had not yet &s;o clear informations, as, he pre&s;um'd he &s;hould have after two or three days:</Q> And &s;o departed to his Chamber.</P>
<P>IT was a wonderful influence, that this Noble Per&s;on's Stars (which u&s;ed to lead him into, and out of the greate&s;t perplexities and dangers, throughout the whole cour&s;e of his Life) had upon this whole affair.
<PB N="548" REF="5660">
<HI>Hotham</HI> was, by his nature and education, a rough and a rude Man; of great covetou&s;ne&s;s, of great pride, and great ambition; without any Bowels of good nature, or the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e, or touch of genero&s;ity; his parts were not quick and &s;harp, but compo&s;ed, and he judged well; he was a Man of craft, and more like to deceive, than to be couzen'd: Yet, after all this, this young Noble Man, known, and abhorr'd by him, for his ad|mirable faculty of Di&s;&s;imulation, had &s;o far prevail'd, and impo&s;ed upon his &s;pirit, that he re&s;olved to Practice that Virtue, which the other had Imputed to him; and not to &s;uffer him to fall into the hands of his Ene|mies. He &s;ent for him, the next day, at an hour when he was more vacant <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> from attendants, and ob&s;ervers; and, at fir&s;t, told him his re&s;olution; <Q>&startq;&endq;that, &s;ince he had &s;o frankly put him&s;elf into his hands, he would not deceive his Tru&s;t; and wi&s;hed him "to con&s;ider, in what way, and by what colour, he &s;hould &s;o &s;et him at Liberty, that he might, without any other danger, arrive at the place where he would be.

Then lamented his own Fate, "that, being a Man of very different Principles from tho&s;e, who drove things to this extre|mity, and of intire affection and duty to the King, he &s;hould now be looked upon as the chief ground, and cau&s;e of the Civil War which was to en&s;ue, by his not opening the Ports, when the King would have en|ter'd into the Town:</Q> Of which bu&s;ine&s;s, and of all the circum&s;tances attending it, he &s;pake at large; and avow'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the information &s;ent him of the King's purpo&s;e pre&s;ently to hang him, was the true cau&s;e of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> his having proceeded in that manner.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who knew wellenough how to cultivate every period of &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, and how to work upon tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which were mo&s;t predominant in him, joyn'd with him in the &s;en&s;e of the Calamities, which were like to befal the Nation; which he bewailed Pathetically; and, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it &s;hould be in the power of a handful of ill Men, corrupted in their Affections to the King, and again&s;t Monarchy it &s;elf, to be able to involve him, and many other of his clear intentions, in their dark Coun&s;els, and to engage them to pro&s;ecute ends which they abhorred, and which mu&s;t determine in the ruin of all the undertakers. For, he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> told him, that the King, in a &s;hort time, would reduce all his Enemies: That the hearts of the People were allready, in all places, aliened from them; and that the Fleet was &s;o much at the King's di&s;po&s;al, that, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould receive his Orders, they would appear in any place he ap|pointed&punc; That all the Princes in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> were concern'd in the quarrel, and would engage in it, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould be invited to it: And that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was re&s;olved to come over in the head of his Army,</Q> and would take <HI>Hull</HI> in three days.

This was the cau&s;e of the &s;uddain March towards <HI>Hull,</HI> before there was a Soldier levied to make an A&s;&s;ault, or maintain a Siege; which was &s;o much wonder'd at then, and &s;o much cen&s;ur'd afterwards. For a&s;&s;oon as his Maje&s;ty received this a&s;&s;urance, which he had &s;o much rea|&s;on to depend upon, by the treatment the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had received, he de|clared, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> "he would, upon &s;uch a day, go to <HI>Beverly,</HI> a place within four miles of <HI>Hull;</HI> and appointed three or four Regiments of the Country, under the Command of &s;uch Gentlemen who&s;e affection was unque&s;tionable, to march thither, as a Guard to his Per&s;on; and likewi&s;e &s;ent a little Train of Artillery, which might be ready for the Summons.

And yet the General had no opinion, that his Army of Train'd-bands would frankly expo&s;e them|&s;elves to &s;uch an Attack: Be&s;ides a great number of Officers, and Per&s;ons of Quality, who were all well Hor&s;ed, and had many Servants as well pro|vided, the King had his Troop of Guards &s;o con&s;tituted, as hath been &s;aid before; and there were few Hor&s;e in <HI>Hull,</HI> and tho&s;e without Officers, who under&s;tood that kind of Service. So that it was no hard matter to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> take a very full view of the Town, by riding to the very Ports, and about the Walls; nor, at fir&s;t appearance, was there any &s;hew of Ho&s;tility from the Town upon their neare&s;t approaches to it; but after they had made that vi&s;it two or three days together, they ob&s;erved that the Walls were better mann'd, and that there was every day an increa&s;e of labourers re|pairing the Works; and then they begun to Shoot, when any went within di&s;tance of the Works.</P>
<P>ALL this while S^$ <HI>John Hotham</HI> had tryed &s;ome of his Officers, in who&s;e particular affection he had mo&s;t confidence, how far they were like to be govern'd by him; and found them of a temper not to be relied upon. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> His Son was grown jealous of &s;ome de&s;ign, and was caballing with tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t notorious for their di&s;affection to the Government; and new Officers were &s;ent down, by the Parliament, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of the Town&punc; which, they thought, might probably be attempted; and &s;upplies of Men had been taken in from the Ships, and had been &s;ent thi|ther from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> a Town, upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, of eminent di&s;loyalty. So that&punc; when the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> return'd thither, he found a great damp upon the &s;pirit of the Governour, and a &s;adne&s;s of mind, that he had pro|ceeded &s;o far; of which his Lord&s;hip made all the ha&s;t he could to adver|ti&s;e the King; but his Letters mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;ent to <HI>York</HI> before they could <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> come to <HI>Beverly;</HI> and, when they were received, they contain'd &s;till &s;omewhat of hope, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he &s;hould be able to re&s;tore him to his former courage,</Q> and confirm his re&s;olution: So that the King &s;eem'd to defer any attempt, upon the hopes of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>s Me&s;&s;age before mention'd, and, in the end, he was compelled to give over the de&s;ign, all hope from the Governour growing de&s;perate; whether from his want of Courage, or want of Power to execute what he de&s;ired, remains &s;till un|certain. When S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> gave over further thoughts of it, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed both the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and Coll. <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> whom he had like|wi&s;e detain'd till then, as a Man of u&s;e in the execution of the de&s;ign, with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> many profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to the King; and as the concealing tho&s;e two Per&s;ons, and afterwards relea&s;ing them, immediately increa&s;ed the jea|lou&s;y of the Parliament again&s;t him, &s;o it was the Principal cau&s;e, after|wards, of the lo&s;s of his Head.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Train'd bands, and return'd with his Court to <HI>York,</HI> in &s;o much le&s;s credit than when he came from thence, as the en|tering into a War without power, or preparation to pro&s;ecute it, was like to produce. The inconvenience was the greater, becau&s;e the principal Per&s;ons of Quality, of Court or Country, and the Officers, had the le&s;s reverence for the King's conduct, by &s;eeing &s;uch an Action enter'd upon with &s;o lit|tle <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> rea&s;on, and pro&s;ecuted &s;o perfunctorily: All which reproaches his Ma|je&s;ty thought fitter to bear, than to di&s;cover the Motives of his Journey; which were then known to few, nor, to this day, have been publi&s;hed.</P>

March he had made, and all Men expre&s;&s;ing great impatience to be in Action, very many Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality, having attended long at Court, believing they might be more u&s;eful to his Maje&s;ty's Service in their own Countries, in re&s;training the di&s;affected from any &s;editious at|tempts, and di&s;po&s;ing the People in general to be con&s;tant in their Loyalty, an Accident fell out, that made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the King to de|clare the War, and to enter upon it, before he was in any degree ripe for Action; which was, that <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had declared for the King, and re|fu&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co$ <HI>Goring,</HI> at <HI>Port$|mouth,</HI> de|clares for the King.</NOTE> to &s;ubmit to the Parliament; which had thereupon &s;ent an Army, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> under the Command of S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> to reduce it.

<P>WE have remember'd before, in the la&s;t year, the di&s;cour&s;e of the bring|ing up the Army to <HI>London</HI> to awe the Parliament, and the un&s;peakable di&s;honour, and damage the King &s;u&s;tain'd by that di&s;cour&s;e, how ground|le&s;s &s;oever it was; all which was imputed to Coll. <HI>Goring,</HI> who, by that means, grew into great reputation with the Parliament, as a Man &s;o irreco|verably <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> lo&s;t at Court, that he would joyn with them in the mo&s;t de&s;perate de&s;igns; yet he carried him&s;elf with &s;o great dexterity, that, within few Months, he wrought upon the King and Queen to believe, that he &s;o much repented that fault, that he would redeem it by any Service; and to tru&s;t him to that degree, that the Queen, once, re&s;olv'd, when the tumults drove their Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t from <HI>London,</HI> for her &s;ecurity, to put her &s;elf into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> which was under his Government; whil&s;t his Maje&s;ty betook him&s;elf to the Northern parts; which de&s;ign was no &s;ooner over (if not before) than he, again, intimated &s;o much of it to the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and that Party, that they took all the tru&s;t, he had from Court, to proceed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> from the confidence, their Maje&s;ty's had of his Father's intere&s;t in him; who&s;e Affection, and Zeal to their Service was ever mo&s;t indubitable: but a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves, He was their own, even again&s;t his own Father. So that he carried the matter &s;o, that, at the &s;ame time, he receiv'd 3000$ from the Queen (which &s;he rai&s;ed by the &s;ale of her Plate, and &s;ome Jewels) to fortify, and victual, and reinforce his Garri&s;on, again&s;t the time it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to declare for the King; and a good &s;upply from the Parliament, for the payment of the Garri&s;on, that it might be kept the better devoted to Them, and to Their Service. All which he perform'd with that admirable di&s;&s;imulation, and rare confidence, that, when the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e of Commons was inform'd by a Member, who&s;e Zeal, and Affection to them was as much valued as any Man's, <Q>&startq;&endq;that all his corre&s;pondence in the County was with the mo&s;t Malignant Per&s;ons; that of tho&s;e, many frequently re&s;orted to, and continued with him in the Garri&s;on; that he was fortifying, and rai&s;ing of Batteries towards the Land: And that, in his di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;pecially in the &s;ea&s;ons of his good fellow&s;hip, he u&s;ed to utter threats again&s;t the Parliament, and &s;harp cen&s;ures of their Proceedings.</Q> And upon &s;uch Informations (the Author whereof was well known to them, and of great reputation; and lived &s;o near <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> that he could not be mi&s;taken, in the matter of fact) the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> Hou&s;e &s;ent for him, mo&s;t thinking he would refu&s;e to come.</P>

Then he took notice of every particular that had been publickly &s;aid again&s;t him, or pri|vately whi&s;per'd, and gave &s;uch plau&s;ible An&s;wers to the whole, inter|mingling &s;harp taunts, and &s;corns, to what had been &s;aid of him, with pretty application of him&s;elf, and flattery to the Men that &s;pake it: Con|cluding, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they well knew, in what e&s;teem he &s;tood with others; &s;o <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> that if, by his ill carriage, he &s;hould forfeit the good opinion of that Hou&s;e, upon which he only depended, and to who&s;e Service he intirely devoted him&s;elf, he were madder than his Friends took him to be, and mu&s;t be as unpitied in any mi&s;ery, that could befall him, as his Enemies would be glad to &s;ee him.</Q> With which, as innocently and unaffectedly uttered, as can be imagin'd, he got &s;o general an Applau&s;e from the whole Hou&s;e, that, not without &s;ome little Apology for troubling him, <Q>&startq;&endq;they de&s;ir'd him again to repair to his Government, and to fini&s;h tho&s;e Works, which were nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the place;</Q> and gratified him with con&s;enting to all the Propo&s;itions, he made in behalf of his Garri&s;on, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> paid him a good &s;um of Money for their Arrears; with which, and being privately a&s;&s;ured (which was indeed re&s;olved on) that he &s;hould be Lieu|tenant General of their Hor&s;e in their new Army, when it &s;hould be form'd, he departed again to <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> in the mean time, a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty by tho&s;e, who were tru&s;ted between them, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he would be &s;peedily in a Po&s;ture to make any &s;uch Declaration for his Service, as he &s;hould be required;</Q> which he was forced to do &s;ooner than he was provided for it, tho' not &s;ooner than he had rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>WHEN the Levies for the Parliament Army were in good forward|ne&s;s, and that Lord had received his Commi&s;&s;ion for Lieutenant General <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the Hor&s;e, he wrote to the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> who was his mo&s;t bo&s;ome Friend, and a Man very powerful, de&s;iring, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he might not be called to give his attendance upon the Army, till it was ready to march; be|cau&s;e there were &s;o many things to be done, and perfected, for the &s;afety

of that important Place, that he was de&s;irous to be pre&s;ent Him&s;elf at the work as long as was po&s;&s;ible. In the mean time, he had given di|rections to his Agent in <HI>London,</HI> to prepare all things for his equipage; &s;o that he would be ready to appear, at any Rendezvous, upon a days warning.</Q> Tho' the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> did much de&s;ire his company, and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in the Council of War, and preparing the Articles, and forming the Di&s;cipline for the Army, he having been more lately ver&s;ed in the Order and Rule of Marches, and the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary, or convenient there|unto, than any Man then in their Service, and of greater Command than <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> any Man but the General; yet the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> prevailed, that he might not be &s;ent for, till things were riper for Action. And, when that Lord did afterwards write to him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it was time he &s;hould come away,</Q> he &s;ent &s;uch new, and rea&s;onable excu&s;es, that they were not un|&s;atisfied with his delay; till he had multiplied tho&s;e excu&s;es &s;o long, that they begun to &s;u&s;pect; and they no &s;ooner inclined to &s;u&s;picion but they met with abundant Arguments to cheri&s;h it. His behaviour and cour&s;e of Life was very notorious to all the Neighbours, nor was he at all re&s;erv'd in his mirth, and publick Di&s;cour&s;es, to conceal his opinion of the Parlia|ment, and their Proceedings. So that, at la&s;t, the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> writ <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> plainly to him, <Q>&startq;&endq;that he could no longer excu&s;e his ab&s;ence from the Ar|my, where he was much wanted; and that, if he did not come to <HI>London</HI> by &s;uch a &s;hort day, as he named, he found his Integrity would be doubt|ed; and that many things were laid to his charge, of which he doubted not his innocence; and therefore conjured him, immediately, to be at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI></Q> it being now to be no longer deferr'd, or put off. He wr$$ a jolly Letter to that Lord, <Q>&startq;&endq;that, the truth was, his Council advi&s;ed him, that the Parliament did many things which were illegal; and that he might incur much danger by obeying all their Orders; that he had re|ceived the Command of that Garri&s;on from the King; and that he dur&s;t <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> not be ab&s;ent from it,</Q> without His leave: And concluded with &s;ome good Coun&s;el to the Lord.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration of the Governour of a place, which had the reputa|tion of being the only place of &s;trength in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ituated upon the Sea, put them into many apprehen&s;ions; and they lo&s;t no time in endea|vouring to reduce it; but, upon the fir&s;t under&s;tanding his re&s;olution, S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was &s;ent, with a good part of the Army, &s;o to block it up, that neither Men, nor Provi&s;ion, might be able to get in; and &s;ome Ships were &s;ent from the Fleet, to prevent any relief by Sea: And the&s;e ad|verti&s;ements came to the King, a&s;&s;oon as he return'd to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> IT gave no &s;mall reputation to his Maje&s;ty's Affairs, when there was &s;o great a damp upon the &s;pirits of Men, from the mi&s;adventures at <HI>Be|verly,</HI> that &s;o notable a place as <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had declared for him, in the very beginning of the War; and that &s;o good an Officer as <HI>Goring,</HI> was re|turn'd to his duty, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town: And the King, who was not &s;urpri&s;ed with the matter, knowing well the re&s;olution of the Colonel, made no doubt, but that he was very well &s;upplied with all things, as he might well have been, to have given the Rebels work for three, or four Months, at the lea&s;t. Whereupon, he forthwith publi&s;hed a Declara|tion&punc; that had been long ready, in which he recapitulated all the In&s;olent, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and Rebellious Actions the two Hou&s;es had committed again&s;t him&punc; and declared them <Q>&startq;&endq;to be guilty; and forbid all his Subjects to yield any obe|dience to them:</Q> And, at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed his Proclamation; by which, he <Q>&startq;&endq;required all Men, who could bear Armes, to repair to him at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> by the 25^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following; on which day, he would

<P>MANY were then of opinion, <Q>&startq;&endq;that it had been more for his Maje&s;ty's benefit and Service, if the Standard had been appointed to be &s;et up at <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> <HI>York;</HI> and &s;o that the King had &s;tayed there, without moving further South, until he could have marched in the head of an Army, and not to depend upon gathering an Army up in his March. All the Northern Counties were, at pre&s;ent, mo&s;t at his devotion; and &s;o it would be mo&s;t ea&s;y to rai&s;e Men there: <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> was the only Port in his obedience, and whither he had appointed his &s;upplies of Armes, and Ammunition to be &s;ent; of which he had &s;o pre&s;ent need, that all his Magazine, which was brought in the Providence, was allready di&s;tributed to tho&s;e few Gentlemen, who had received Commi&s;&s;ions, and were mo&s;t like &s;peedily to rai&s;e their Regiments; and it would be a very long, and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> might prove a very dangerous pa&s;&s;age to get the &s;upplies, which were daily expected, to be brought with &s;ecurity from <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> when the King &s;hould be advanced &s;o many days Journey beyond <HI>York.</HI></Q> All which were very important con&s;iderations, and ought to have prevailed; but the King's inclinations to be nearer <HI>London,</HI> and the expectation he had of great effects from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and the We&s;t, di&s;po&s;ed him to a willing|ne&s;s to prefer <HI>Nottingham;</HI> but that which determin'd the Point, was an apparent, and manife&s;t aver&s;ion in the <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> Gentlemen, who&s;e af|fections were lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould continue&punc; and remain at <HI>York;</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;which, they &s;aid, the People apprehended, would inevitably <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> make that Country the &s;eat of the War:</Q> unskilfully imagining, that the War would be no where, but where the King's Army was; and therefore they facilitated all things, which might contribute to his remove from thence; undertook, to provide Convoys for any Armes and Ammunition from <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> to ha&s;ten the Levies in their own Country; and to borrow the Armes of &s;ome of the Train'd-bands; which was the be&s;t ex|pedient, that could be found out, to arm the King's Troops, and had it's rever&s;e in the murmurs it produced, and in leaving the be&s;t affected Men, by being di&s;arm'd, at the mercy of their Enemies; who carefully kept their Weapons, that they might be ready to fight again&s;t the King. This <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> cau&s;ed the re&s;olution to be taken for <HI>Nottingham,</HI> without enough weigh|ing the objections, which, upon the Entrance into great Actions, cannot be too much deliberated, tho', in the Execution, they were be&s;t &s;hut out. And it quickly appeared in tho&s;e very Men, who prevailed mo&s;t in that
<PB N="555" REF="5730">
Council; for, when the time drew on, in which his Maje&s;ty was to depart, and leave the Country, Then they remember'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that the Garri&s;on of <HI>Hull</HI> would be left as a thorn in their &s;ides, where there were well form'd, and active Troops, which might march over the Country with|out control, and come into <HI>York</HI> it &s;elf without re&s;i&s;tance: That there were many di&s;affected Per&s;ons of Quality, and Intere&s;t in the Country, who, a&s;&s;oon as the King &s;hould be gone, would appear among&s;t their neighbours, and find a concurrence from them in their wor&s;t de&s;igns; and that there were &s;ome places, &s;ome whole Corporations, &s;o noto|riou&s;ly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> di&s;affected, e&s;pecially in matters relating to the Church, that they wanted only Conductors to carry them into Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>THESE, and the like reflections, made too late impre&s;&s;ions upon them; and Now, too much, they magnified this Man's power&punc; whom before they contemn'd; and doubted that Man's Affection, of which they were before &s;ecure; and made a thou&s;and Propo&s;itions to the King this day, whereof they rejected the greate&s;t part to morrow; and, as the day approached nearer for the King's departure, their apprehen&s;ions and irre&s;olutions in|crea&s;ed. In the end, they were united in two Reque&s;ts to the King; <Q>that &startq;&endq;he would commit the &s;upreme Command of the Country, with re|ference <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> to all Military Affairs, to the Earl of <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and qualify him, with an ample Commi&s;&s;ion, to that purpo&s;e. The other, &punc;that his Maje&s;ty would command S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> to remain with them, to govern and command &s;uch Forces, as the Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary for their defence.</Q> And this Provi&s;ion being made by the King, they obliged them&s;elves to concur in making any preparations, and forming any Forces the Earl &s;hould require. His Maje&s;ty, as willingly, gratified them in both their de&s;ires. The Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> was a Man of great Honour and Integrity, who had all his E&s;tate in that Country&punc; and had lived mo&s;t among&s;t them, with very much acceptation, and af|fection <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> from the Gentlemen, and the Common People: but he was not, in any degree, active, or of a Martial temper; and rather a Man more like not to have any Enemies, than to oblige any to be firmly, and re&s;o|lutely his Friends, or to pur&s;ue his Intere&s;t: The great Fortune of the Family was divided, and the greater part of it carried away by an Heir Female; and his Father had &s;o wa&s;ted the remainder, that the Earl could not live with that lu&s;tre, nor draw &s;o great a dependence upon him, as his Ance&s;tors had done. In a word, he was a Man of Honour, and Popular enough in Peace, but not endued with tho&s;e parts, which were nece&s;&s;ary for Such a &s;ea&s;on. S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> was a Gentleman of a noble ex|traction, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and a fair Fortune, tho' he had much impaired it; he had &s;pent many years, in Armies, beyond the Seas; and he had been an Officer of very good e&s;teem in the King's Armies, and of Courage, and Integrity un|que&s;tionable; but he was not of &s;o &s;tirring and active a nature, as to be able to infu&s;e Fire enough into the Flegmatick con&s;titutions of that Peo|ple, who did rather wi&s;h to be Spectators of the War, than Parties in it; and believed, if they did not provoke the other Party, they might all live quietly together; untill S^r <HI>John Hotham,</HI> by his excur&s;ions, and depreda|tions out of <HI>Hull,</HI> and their &s;editious Neighbours, by their In&s;urrections, awaken'd them out of that Plea&s;ant Dream. And then the greate&s;t part <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> of the Gentry of that Populous Country, and very many of the Common People, did behave them&s;elves with &s;ignal Fidelity, and Courage in the King's Service: Of all which Particulars, which de&s;erve well to be re|member'd, and tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, there will be occa&s;ion to make mention, in the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="5740">
YET I cannot leave <HI>York</HI> without the mention of one Particular; which, in truth, is a lively In&s;tance of the Spirit and Temper of that time, and was a &s;ad Pre&s;age of all the misfortunes which follow&punc;d. There were very few Gentlemen, or Men of any Quality, in that large County, who were actively or factiou&s;ly di&s;affected to his Maje&s;ty; and of tho&s;e the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and his Son, S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> were the chief; who were govern&punc;d by two or three, of inferiour Quality, more conver&s;ant with the People; who were as well known as They. All the&s;e were in the County, at their Hou&s;es, within few miles of <HI>York;</HI> and the King re&s;olved, at his going away, to have taken them all Pri&s;oners, and to have put them in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> &s;afe Cu&s;tody; by which, it was very probable, tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs, that &s;hort|ly after broke out, might have been prevented. But the Gentlemen of the County, who were met together to con&s;ult for their own &s;ecurity, hearing of this De&s;ign, be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty <Q>&startq;&endq;Not to do it; alledging, &punc;that he would, thereby, leave them in a wor&s;e condition, by an Act &s;o ungra|cious, and unpopular; and that the di&s;affected would be &s;o far from be|ing weaken&punc;d,</Q> that their Party would be increa&s;ed thereby; many really believing, that neither Father nor Son were tran&s;ported with over-vehe|ment inclinations to the Parliament; but would willingly &s;it &s;till, with|out being Active on either &s;ide; which, no doubt, was a Policy, that many <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> of tho&s;e, who wi&s;hed well, de&s;ired and intended to be &s;afe by. And &s;o his Maje&s;ty left <HI>York,</HI> taking with him only two or three of inferior rank (whereof one <HI>Stapleton</HI> was one) who were known to have been very active in &s;tirring the People to Sedition; and yet, upon &s;ome &s;pecious pretences, &s;ome very good Men were per&s;waded, within few days, to procure the Liberty and Inlargement even of tho&s;e from his Maje&s;ty. So tickli&s;h were tho&s;e times, and &s;o wary were all Men to advi&s;e, the King &s;hould do any thing, which, upon the &s;tricte&s;t inqui&s;ition, might &s;eem to &s;werve from the &s;trict rule of the Law; beleiving, unrea&s;onably, that the &s;ofte&s;t and gentle&s;t Remedies might be mo&s;t whole&s;omely ap|plied <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"> to tho&s;e rough, and violent Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE King came to <HI>Nottingham</HI> two or three days before the day, he had appointed to &s;et up the Standard; having taken <HI>Lincoln</HI> in his way, and drawn &s;ome Armes from the Train&punc;d-bands of that Country with him to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> from whence, the next day, he went to take a veiw of his Hor&s;e; whereof there were &s;everal Troops well arm'd, and under good Officers, to the number of &s;even or eight hundred Men; with which, being inform'd, <Q>&startq;&endq;that there were &s;ome Regiments of Foot marching to|wards <HI>Coventry,</HI></Q> by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> his Orders, he made ha&s;t thither; making little doubt, but that he &s;hould be able to get thither before them, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"> and &s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of that City; and he did get thither the day be|fore they came; but found, not only the Gates &s;hut again&s;t him, but &s;ome of his Servants &s;hot, and wounded from the Walls: Nor could all his Me&s;&s;ages, and Summons prevail with the Mayor and Magi&s;trates, before there was any Garri&s;on there, to &s;uffer the King to enter into the City. So great an Intere&s;t, and Reputation the Parliament had gotten over the Affections of that People, who&s;e hearts were alienated from any reverence to the Government.</P>
<P>THE King could not remedy the Affront, but went that night to <HI>Stonely,</HI> the Hou&s;e then of S^r <HI>Thomas Lee;</HI> where he was well received; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"> and, the next day, his Body of Hor&s;e, having a clear view, upon an open Campania, for five or &s;ix miles together, of the Enemies &s;mall Body of Foot, which con&s;i&s;ted not of above twelve Hundred Men with one Troop of Hor&s;e, which Marched with them over that plain, retired before
<PB N="557" REF="5750">
them, without giving them one Charge; which was imputed to the ill conduct of <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who Commanded; and had a colder Courage, than many who were under him, and who were of opinion, that they might have ea&s;ily defeated that Body of Foot: Which would have been a very &s;ea&s;onable Victory; would have put <HI>Coventry</HI> unque&s;tionably into the King's hands, and &s;ent him with a good Omen to the &s;etting up of his Standard. Whereas, that unhappy Retreat, which looked like a Defeat, and the Rebellious behaviour of <HI>Coventry,</HI> made his Maje&s;ty's return to <HI>Nitingham</HI> very Melancholy; whither he return'd the very day the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"> Standard was appointed to be &s;et up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Standard &s;e$ up at <HI>Not|tingham, Aug. 25. 1642.</HI></NOTE> ACCORDING to the Proclamation, upon the twenty fifth day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Standard was erected, about &s;ix of the Clock in the even|ing of a very &s;tormy, and tempe&s;tuous day. The King him&s;elf, with a &s;mall train, rode to the top of the <HI>Castle</HI>&punc;Hill, <HI>Varney</HI> the Knight Mar&s;hal, who was Standard Bearer, carrying the Standard, which was then erected, in that place, with little other Ceremony than the &s;ound of Drums, and Trumpets: Melancholy Men ob&s;erved many ill Pre|&s;ages about that time. There was not one&punc;Regiment of Foot yet brought thither, &s;o that the Train'd-bands, which the Sheriff had drawn toge|ther, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"> were all the &s;trength the King had for his Per&s;on, and the Guard of the Standard. There appeared no Conflux of Men in obedience to the Proclamation; the Armes, and Ammunition were not yet come from <HI>York,</HI> and a General Sadne&s;s cover'd the whole Town. The Standard was blown down, the &s;ame night it had been &s;et up, by a very &s;trong and unruly wind, and could not be fixed again in a day or two, till the tempe&s;t was allayed. This was the Melancholy State of the King's Affairs, when the Standard was &s;et up.</P>
