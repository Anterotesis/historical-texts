<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is &s;tiled a <HI>po&s;t&s;cript</HI> to this Work, tho' in it &s;elf an Introdu|ction,
&s;o it is principally de&s;ign'd, to reply to the Po&s;t&s;cript of
the <HI>Narrative</HI> plac'd al&s;o in the Front of that Work, and al&s;o to
give &s;ome State of the Ca&s;e, that &s;uch Readers as have not &s;een the
&s;aid <HI>Narrative</HI> may not be in the Dark, for want of having been Ma|&s;ters
of the Controver&s;ie.</P>
<P>In order then to make this plain; The Reader is to under&s;tand, that
upon the Abdication of the late King <HI>James, for from thence, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry
to fetch the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of this Affair</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Presby$erians</HI> in the We&s;t
of <HI>Scotland</HI> fir&s;t, and the Convention of E&s;tates afterward, made an en|tire
Church-Revolution in that Kingdom, as the Coming of the Prince of
<HI>Orange, (afterwards King</HI>-William) had done in the State.</P>
<P>It is true, that the poor We&s;tern People, whom the Tyranny of Prelacy
had made furious, and under which Tyranny, that mi&s;erable Country had
been reduc'd to De&s;peration, took a cour&s;e, which neither the Govern|ment
or Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> were pleas'd or could be charg'd with:
<HI>Not the Government.</HI> Becau&s;e in the Infancy of the Revolution, it had not
Power to prevent it: <HI>Not the Church,</HI> Becau&s;e it was done almo&s;t a whole
Year before the Church had any Legal E&s;tabli&s;hment; and therefore as
to the Language of the Law, <HI>was not in being;</HI> and nothing can act before
it exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is true al&s;o, that after the We&s;tern People had as above, Rabbled the
Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters out of their Part of the Country; the Convention
did not repone them, which now the&s;e People complain of; <HI>to which may
be an&s;wer'd; First,</HI> It could not be expected, that a Con&s;titution re|&s;olv'd
to depo&s;e Epi&s;copacy it &s;elf, &s;hould repone Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters <HI>as
&s;uch,</HI> tho' they were put out in an unju&s;tifyable Method; if they had
thought fit to conform to <HI>Presbytery,</HI> they could not have mi&s;s'd to obtain
other Livings; Mini&s;ters being at that time wanted to fill the number of
vacant Churches; and if they would not conform, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould
they have been repon'd by Authority, immediately to have been Depo&s;ed
again.</P>
<P>It is true al&s;o, at that Time, the Country which had ca&s;t them out, in
Memory of the Cruelties &s;uffer'd under their Hierarchy, would not have
receiv'd them, neither would the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, if in their right
Wits, have ventur'd to have gone among them, or could the Government
have protected them till it it had been better &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Thus what by the We&s;tern Rabbles fir&s;t, and the Convention of E&s;tates
afterwards, Epi&s;copacy was Dethroned, and Presbytery e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
and this is granting more to them as to the We&s;tern Rabbles, than
is &s;trictly &s;peaking due to them.</P>
<P>However, tho' to anticipate the Cavils of the Objectors, we have own'd the
Rabbles in the We&s;t did throw out &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, yet it is mo&s;t
certain, that after the fir&s;t heat, the Revolution in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
was, <HI>generally &s;peaking,</HI> carried with all the Mildne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, as
could con&s;i&s;t with the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Work in general.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
The Bi&s;hops being thus di&s;plac'd by the Law, and &s;uch Mini&s;ters as po&s;&s;e&s;t
tho&s;e Livings, of which the former Incumbents <HI>who were turn'd out in</HI> 1662.
were yet living, demitting by a particular Act of Parliament; the re&s;t was
carryed on with all po&s;&s;ible Tenderne&s;s; and at la&s;t an Act of Parliament
was pa&s;&s;ed, That even tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who remain'd Epi&s;copal, and would
not conform to Presbytery, <HI>yet if they would take the Oaths to the Government,</HI>
&s;hould enjoy their Bene&s;ices.</P>
<P>By this means, the <HI>Presbyterian Church</HI> was obliged to content her &s;elf, to
&s;ee near 200 <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> preaching in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and enjoying the Sti|pends
and Glebes of the Church, and &s;he was rather &s;atisfied to have it &s;o,
than to proceed by cruel and rigorous Methods to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>By this means al&s;o, very few <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> became de&s;titute,
except &s;uch as ob&s;tinately rejected the Oaths to the Governme$$, and openly
adhered to the <HI>Jacobite Intere&s;t,</HI> or &s;uch as were &s;candalous and in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>During the Reign of King <HI>William,</HI> the&s;e kept them&s;elves pretty quiet,
and we heard very little, either of their di&s;turbing the Church, or of the
Government being unea&s;ie with them: But upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of Her pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty to the Crown, they took hold of the Queen's Letter, obliging
the Privy-Council to protect them, while they behaved peaceably to the
Government, either willfully or ignorantly mi&s;taking Her Maje&s;ty's mean|ing,
and pretending to reckon it a Tacit Toleration, tho' no &s;uch thing was
intended.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>this,</HI> they began to &s;how their Heads with an unu&s;ual Confidence,
and to erect <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es</HI> in all Parts of the Kingdom, <HI>as they had Ac|ce&s;s,</HI>
openly profe&s;&s;ing their <HI>Jacobite,</HI> as well as <HI>Epi&s;copal Principles;</HI> in&s;ul|ting
the Government, by refu&s;ing to pray for the Queen, refu&s;ing to joyn
in the Publick Fa&s;ts, for Succe&s;s of the Queen's Arms, or in Thank&s;givings
for Victories; &s;ome of them <HI>openly</HI> praying for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all of
them <HI>tacitly</HI> and <HI>ambignou&s;ly:</HI> Be&s;ides their Scandalous Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Church
Judicatories, Clande&s;tine Marriages</HI> without Publication, Baptizing the Chil|dren
of Per&s;ons under <HI>Church Cen&s;ure,</HI> to the De&s;truction of good Di&s;cipline
and the Encouragement of Prophanene&s;s and Immoralities.</P>
<P>In this manner they went on with impunity; yet however the Church
found them&s;elves aggriev'd by them, they however remitted their Puni&s;h|ment
to their own itnemperate heat, not doubting, but fir&s;t or la&s;t they
would bring the re&s;entments of God and the Government upon them;
nor did the Government take any notice to puni&s;h the&s;e Di&s;orders, having
at this time the Great Affair of the Union in View at Home, and a heavy
embarra&s;&s;ing War upon their Heads Abroad; till the following Oc|ca&s;ion
alarm'd them, when the Nece&s;&s;ity of Things, the Publick Safety,
the Peace of the Nation and the Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Queen</HI> upon the
Throne requiring it; the Government found them&s;elves oblig'd to take
new Mea&s;urers with the&s;e People.</P>
<P>That there was &s;uch a Real Nece&s;&s;ity, and that it was judged &s;o; fir&s;t
by the Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards by Her Maje&s;ty and the Council
in <HI>England,</HI> the&s;e Sheets, will effectually make appear.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be only noted here; That the Enemy appearing, re&s;olv'd to
invade <HI>Scotland</HI> from Abroad, and the <HI>Jacobite Par$y</HI> at Home, appearing
exceedingly encouraged and elevated, <HI>nor did they keep any extra|ordinary
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Guard upon their Conduct, in order to conceal their &s;aid Elevations</HI>
The Privy Council caution'd by Her Maje&s;ty, of the Preparations of the
<HI>French,</HI> and pre&s;s'd to do their utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve the Publick Peace
thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary among other things, to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e <HI>Ja|cobite
A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and Preachings, as Places where the general Di&s;affection
receiv'd Encouragement, and a Faction was kept up again&s;t the Queen in
behalf of the Pretender.</P>
<P>This is &s;o plain in all the Proceedings, that it need not be repeated; it
was the only Cau&s;e mention'd in the Queen's Letter, in the Councils Or|ders,
and in the Magi&s;trates Citations; 'tis the only Thing alledg'd in the
Libels again&s;t the Mini&s;ters&mdash;All the pretences of a Per&s;e|cution
rais'd again&s;t <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> are prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd; all the Pre|tences
of it being calculated again&s;t, or commenc'd becau&s;e of the bring|ing
the <HI>Engli&s;h Service</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> are fal&s;e in Fact, and have no proba|bility
in them; on the contrary, 'tis evident, the introducing the &s;aid
Service into <HI>Scotland</HI> is a Novelty, calculated to make a &s;hew, as if the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the&s;e People were all one, where as it is evident,
no <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters,</HI> except tho&s;e who re <HI>Non- Jurors</HI> have attempted it.</P>
<P>Upon this Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Jacobite Conventicles</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> a Book is
publi&s;h'd in <HI>England,</HI> Entitl'd <HI>A Narrative of their Treatment, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which the Sheets hereto annex'd are an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>This Narrative <HI>to give an Abridgment of it,</HI> is a Deduction of the Pro|ceedings
again&s;t the <HI>Jacobite Clergy,</HI> upon the Councils ordering the Ma|gi&s;trates
of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to &s;hut up their Meetings.</P>
<P>It tells us how they wre cited to appear before the Magi&s;trates, were
there &s;entenc'd <HI>in&s;tead of Bani&s;hment, which by Law might have been the
Sentence, to de&s;i&s;t from keeping any Meeting Hou&s;es, and exerci&s;ing any part of
their Mini&s;terial Function within the City of</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>&amp;c</HI> and to give Cau|tion
to ob&s;erve it; and that in the mean time their Meeting-Hou&s;es &s;hould
be &s;hut up.</P>
<P>That this Sentence being not regarded by them, but continuing to
preach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They were Cited a &s;econd time in <HI>June,</HI> 1708. and for their
not complying, five of them were &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and the like; all which
and more is very true, as will be &s;een in the exact Account of the
Proceedings, Sign'd by the Town Clark of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and annex'd to this
Work.</P>
<P>With this Account, here are long Complaints of the Incompetency of
the Magi&s;trates to be Judges, and the Illegality of the &s;everal Parts of the
Proceedings, which are all remark'd and reply'd to in this Book.</P>
<P>But above all, this <HI>Narrative</HI> taking up a Lamentation, makes
loud Complaints of the hard&s;hip of being thus pre&s;s'd totake the Oaths,
defends their refu&s;ing to quallify, charges the Government with Cruelty
and Oppre&s;&s;ion in di&s;turbing them, and pleads their own Inoffen&s;ive Be|haviour,
to argue that the Government is &s;afe in them, ought not
to &s;u&s;pect them, and con&s;equently they ought to enjoy their Liberty, tho'
they did not &s;wear to the Government, or pray for the QUEEN.</P>
<P>As to Swearing, the <HI>Narrative</HI> owns they they cannot do it, <HI>p.</HI> 10.
That they cannot di&s;&s;emble nor contradict their known Principles, and
&s;wear to a Government when it is uppermo&s;t, and then abandon it whe$$
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
&startq;down again, and &s;o again as Changes happen, and makes &s;ome Reflections
upon tho&s;e that do &s;o; that the Government ought to let them alone,
tho' they do not &s;wear Allegiance to it, becau&s;e they &s;ay they are of Pea|ceable
Principles&mdash;As to praying for the Queen, the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays,
they do pray for all the <HI>Royal Family</HI> and for THE <HI>QUEEN,</HI> and for all
their Rulers, and the like, in which the Queen <HI>&s;ay they</HI> mu&s;t be included, <HI>p.</HI> 13.&endq;</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;pends a great deal of Time, <HI>and &s;ome Art</HI> to per|&s;wade
the World, that all this Pro&s;ecution is meerly for being <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI>
and more than that, for the acceptance the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> finds in <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
and this is improved to claim Kindred with the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and Intere&s;t them in the Quarrel&mdash;Tho' at the &s;ame time 'tis evident, it
is all for that very <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Principle the Church of <HI>England</HI> has effe|ctual
ca&s;t out in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;t of the <HI>Narrative</HI> is taken up in piteous Exclamations, of the
Sufferings of the Church of <HI>Scotland, as it would have the</HI> Jacobites <HI>there
be called,</HI> and of Recriminations upon the <HI>Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is a faithful Abridgment, both of the State of the Ca&s;e, and
of the Sub&s;tance of the Book we are an&s;wering; for the An&s;wer to it we
refer to the Sheets hereto annex'd; only crave leave to &s;ay a few Words
to the Po&s;t&s;cript plac'd before it, as above. It begins with telling us with
an Air of Lamentation; &startq;how &s;urprizing it is, that tho&s;e of the <HI>Epi&s;copal
Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould be treated as they are <HI>at this time of DAY,</HI>
when People of all other Opinions in Religion, throughout Her Maje&s;$ties
Dominion, enjoy all the Liberty that has been permitted at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
&mdash;-And that the Unprejudic'd Reader will be apt to think, that
the&s;e People are Sinners above all their Fellow-Subjects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t confe&s;s this Prefatory Part has much Truth in it, and the
Ob&s;ervation is very Ju&s;t; in one Part, any one would think &s;o, and upon
Examination every one will find it &s;o; <HI>They are Sinners</HI> in one re&s;pect
<HI>above their Neighbours:</HI> The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government under the be&s;t QUEEN
that ever Rul'd them, tender of the Ea&s;e and Tranquility of all its Sub|jects,
gives as much Liberty as can rea&s;onably be expected, to the diffe|rent
Opinions which too too much divide the Nation; nor is there any
Re&s;traint laid upon Her Maje&s;ties Subjects, in any thing merely Religi|ous&mdash;But
as in the Ca&s;e between GOD Almighty and his Creatures,
there is <HI>a Sin</HI> Man may commit, which cannot be forgiven: So to &s;et
up a Rival <HI>to a Sovereign,</HI> is in the State as the un pardonable Sin is in
Religion; No Prince can bear with it, no Government can, or indeed
ought to di&s;pen&s;e with it&mdash;And here is the accur&s;ed Thing; this is the
Crime in which the&s;e People are Sinners above their Neighbours; This
is the occa&s;ion of all the Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Government with them; And
this is what, thro' the very whole Cour&s;e of the <HI>Narrative</HI> they defend.
The <HI>Narrative</HI> owns their <HI>Jacobite Principles,</HI> and demands of the Govern|ment,
to have them Tolerated as other Con&s;cientious Points are.</P>
<P>Thus they would have us make <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> a Scruple of Con&s;cience, plead
for its being di&s;pen&s;ed with as an Opinion, and in time we may have it call'd
a Religious Tenet; we &s;hould not go this Length with them, if the <HI>Narra|tive</HI>
did not actually mention it in &s;o many Words&mdash;<HI>Pag</HI> 1. of the <HI>Po&s;t &s;cript</HI>
$neir words are, <HI>People of all OTHER OPINIONS in Religion throughout
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
Her Maje&s;y's Dominions enjoy all the Liberty, &amp;c.</HI> 'Tis true, this Word <HI>O|THER</HI>
is &s;et again&s;t the Words <HI>Epi&s;copal Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI>.&mdash;But they cannot mean
<HI>that,</HI> becau&s;e People of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> not only have
Liberty, but are admitted to enjoy their Benefices, and preach in the Pari&s;h
Churches all over the Country&mdash;150 of the Publick Mini&s;ters being to
this Day <HI>Epi&s;copal;</HI> when they &s;ay then <HI>all other opinions of Religion,</HI> they
can mean nothing el&s;e but the Profe&s;&s;ion or Opinion of the <HI>Jacobite Religion,</HI>
and what that is, this Tract is not Ill-natur'd enough to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Again, when they acknowledge, That <HI>all other Opinions in Religion through|out
Her Majesty's Dominion, enjoy all Liberty, &amp;c.</HI> they &s;eem to acknowledge
that their Ca&s;e is not a Point of Religion, for certainly, if all they &s;ay of
them&s;elves were true, that their Behaviour is Peaceable and Inoffen&s;ive, their
Principles &s;uch, as any Government is &s;afe in, and nothing objected again&s;t
their Doctrine; it mu&s;t be &s;omething el&s;e which is not Religious, that
obliges Her Maje&s;ty to &s;ingle them out from all the re&s;t of her Subjects to
Puni&s;h and Per&s;ecute, when her Royal Clemency is extended to all other
People, who&s;e Differences are Religious&mdash;Her Maje&s;ty could not, with|out
the utmo&s;t Scandal upon her Royal Judgment, as well as upon her
Ju&s;tice, be thought to Tolerate or forbear all Opinions but that &s;ame, of
which Her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf is per&s;waded, and in which &s;he expects to go
to Heaven; would Her Maje&s;ty for bear <HI>Jews, Prophets, Socinians, Arminians,</HI>
and an infinite number of Erroneous Opinions, not included in the Legal
Toleration in <HI>England?</HI> Would Her Maje&s;ty adhere &s;o &s;teadily, and defend
&s;o earne&s;tly the <HI>Toleration,</HI> including <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists</HI> and
<HI>Quakers;</HI> and at the &s;ame time that the&s;e enjoy Peace and Tranquility, Safe|ty
and Protection under her Government, &s;uffer an <HI>Epi&s;copalChurch,</HI> the &s;ame
in which &s;he has been educated, in which &s;he is a devout Member, and of
which &s;he is Intitl'd, <HI>The Glorious Defender,</HI> to be the only Per&s;ecuted Di&s;tre&s;s'd
Part of her <HI>Royal Inheritance</HI>&mdash;It can never be&mdash;No, nor indeed is it
true in Fact; for the <HI>Epi&s;copal Church</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' removed from being
National, is not at all Per&s;ecuted&mdash;But all tho&s;e of them who own them|&s;elves
to be Her Maje&s;ty's Subjects, are protected, &s;afe, ea&s;ie, and quiet; their
Mini&s;ters are now Preachers in above 140 Pari&s;h-Churches in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
People of that Per&s;wa&s;ion can with freedom and &s;afety hear them&mdash;And no|thing
is more certain than this, and we a&s;&s;ure the World of the Truth of it;
there is at this time no order given out to &s;uppre&s;s any but tho&s;e who re|fu&s;e
to acknowledge the Government, and pray for the Queen.</P>
<P>This gives a very unhappy Turn to the whole Cau&s;e&mdash;The whole
Complaint they make may be granted without any Prejudice to the Ar|gument&mdash;That
to the <HI>Jacobites</HI> who own a &s;purious Pretender, profe&s;s
the Queen to be a U&s;urper, the Succe&s;&s;ion an U&s;urpation, and the Revo|lution
a Rebellion; the Government does give all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;turbance,
tho' that is granting a great deal too much too.</P>
<P>But to the <HI>Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Scotland, as &s;uch,</HI> no Injury, no Damage
is done, no Di&s;quiet given: The Po&s;t&s;cript to the <HI>Narrative</HI> contradicts
this, and &s;ays, <HI>Pag. 1. No Compliance with the Civil Government avails them;
The Meeting-Hou&s;es of the Complyers are &s;hut up, and their Per&s;ons Di&s;tre&s;s'd, as
well as other,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is very unhappy, that we are oblig'd a little to expo&s;e the Per&s;ons,
here brought as In&s;tances, in order to prove this a Mi&s;take, for Mr. <HI>Herriot</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
of <HI>Mu&s;&s;elbrough</HI> was Depo&s;ed from his Mini&s;try, both by the Church-Ju|dicatories,
and by the Privy-Council, as not being a Per&s;on fit to
officiate in Sacred Things; the Immoralities and Scandalous Life of
the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Herriot,</HI> being prov'd before them. Mr. <HI>Peacock,</HI> as
by the Sheets hereafter appears in the &s;ame Predicament, and the
other Per&s;ons named, tho' they did pray for the Queen, yet they refu&s;ed
to take the Oaths&mdash;. It does not &s;eem as if this Part of
the Narrative were of a Piece with the other, that there &s;hould be no
better Evidence, brought to prove, <HI>that Complyers were equally pro&s;ecuted,</HI>
than a few &s;candalous Mini&s;ters pro&s;ecuted and expung'd for their Crimes.
It &s;eems &s;omething of a Reproach to the&s;e People, who call them&s;elves the
Epi&s;copal Church; that the vicious and &s;candalous Mini&s;ters, that the
Church Judicatories cen&s;ure and depo&s;e, &s;hould all take Shelter under
them. Is it a que&s;tion, whether the&s;e will take any Oaths, and pa&s;s any
Qualifications; and mu&s;t the&s;e be &s;creen'd by their Qualifications, and &s;uffer'd
to keep open Meeting-hou&s;es, who ought to be &s;pued out of all Profe&s;&s;ions,
as not fit to concern them&s;elves about other Peoples Souls, till they ap|pear'd
more concern'd for their own?&mdash;And it &s;eems &s;omething of a
Reflection on a certain antient Peer, who is not ignorant either of the Rea|&s;on
or Nece&s;&s;ity of Church Cen&s;ures, to di&s;courage Vice and Immoralities,
that he &s;hould admit a Man to qualifie before him as a Mini&s;ter, who he
knew was depos'd from being a Mini&s;ter for Scandal by a legal Proceed|ing
and Sentence.</P>

who it is beneath the Per&s;ons we are &s;peaking of to own them&s;elves joyn'd
with&mdash;The Mini&s;ters proce&s;s'd before the Magi&s;trates, tho' <HI>Jacobite,</HI>
are allow'd many of them to be Men of good Characters, Men of Hone&s;ty,

in the Matters of this HITTITE,</HI> we have great Compa&s;&s;ion, great
Concern for their Circum&s;tances, and many Wi&s;hes for that Time, when
their Judgments being inform'd, they &s;hall be re&s;tor'd to her Maje&s;ty as
good Subjects. But the Author of the Narrative mu&s;t have but &s;mall
Thanks from them, when they &s;ee them&s;elves link'd by him in the &s;ame
Row, or plac'd in the &s;ame Cla&s;s with the &s;candalous, immoral and in|&s;ufficient,
who will &s;wear to any &s;ide, and adhere to no &s;ide, and who be|ing
all over black with Reproach for ju&s;t Crimes, mu&s;t leave &s;ome of their
Filth upon the Reputation of any Party they take Shelter with.</P>
<P>It will be no lo&s;s to our Argument at all, to throw them all the&s;e in|to
the Article of Per&s;ecution; for if &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Vice and Immoralities, and
e&s;pecially rooting them out from among the Clergy, removing Scandal from
the Altar, and purifying the Tribe of <HI>Levy,</HI> be the Sin of the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> if this be what we are calling Per&s;ecution; 'tis her Glory that
$word$ is the mo&s;t per&s;ecuting Church at this Time in the World.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
The Narrative therefore mu&s;t give &s;ome better Proofs, and bring &s;ome
other Examples to make it clear, that <HI>no compliance with the Civil Government
avails,</HI> &s;ince 'tis certain, no compliance of &s;uch Men ought to avail, and
no compliance of other than &s;uch has been offer'd.</P>
<P>From this the Narrative falls into another weakne&s;s, <HI>as great as the for|mer;</HI>

<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary to examine the Proce&s;s, the Particulars of
which is annext to this Work; where it will appear, that however the&s;e
four Per&s;ons might pray for Her Maje&s;ty <HI>Nominatim;</HI> yet that every
one of them acknowledg'd they had not taken the Oath of Allegiance to
Her, nor would they take it when required; how then the Author of
this Book will come off of his &s;aying as above, <HI>they had given all the Evidence

wait to &s;ee.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the fir&s;t Evidence in the Eye of the Law, that Men can give
of their Loyalty and Affection to the Per&s;on of the Queen, is to acknow|ledge
her to be Queen; now 'tis evident, that all the&s;e Men refu&s;e to
&s;wear Allegiance to her; how then can they be &s;aid to give <HI>all the Evi|dence
Men can give?</HI> It is true, Men may decline Swearing, and yet
may give Evidence of their Loyalty and good Affection to the Queen;
and this is the Ca&s;e of &s;everal, even of the <HI>Presbyterian Mini&s;ters,</HI> who
have their Scruples about the Oaths, <HI>as well as other People,</HI> as an Oath of
Allegiance; and yet give &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of their con&s;tant Zeal for
the QUEEN, on all other Occa&s;ions; but even of the&s;e, no Man will
&s;ay, they gave <HI>all the Evidence that Man can give, &amp;c.</HI> But to &s;ay <HI>the&s;e

<HEAD>The SCOTS NARRATIVE Examin'd, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter into the Particulars of this long Complaint,
and more narrowly examine the Narrative of the <HI>Jacobite
Clergy</HI> now before us; it is not improper to form &s;ome Prelimi|naries,
which being abundantly granted in all the Parts of the Book we
are &s;peaking to, will admit no Di&s;pute, but may be laid down as Fun|damentals
in the pre&s;ent Debate&mdash;And if they require any Te&s;timo|ny
to make them out, it will be &s;ufficient to quote their own <HI>Narrative</HI>
for the Proof.</P>
<P>1. That the Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which
all this Complaint is made, is a Pro&s;ecution from the Civil Magi|&s;trate
only&mdash;That there is no Procedure again&s;t them
from the Church, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> by any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Proce&s;s, or
Church Judicatory, &s;uch as <HI>Se&s;&s;ion, Presbytery, Synod,</HI> or <HI>General
A&s;&s;embly,</HI> which are the only Judicial Powers in the Church of <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>This is proved by the Narrative it &s;elf, <HI>pag.</HI> 5. where they complain
of the Irregularity of the Proceedings&mdash;Becau&s;e, <HI>the Com|plaint
is not moved by the Presbytery of the Bounds,</HI> as they &s;ay the
Law requires&mdash;And the Narrative complains, <HI>that this was
pleaded</HI> to the Juri&s;diction of the Magi&s;trates, but not allow'd.</P>
<P>2. That this Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is upon
no Point of their Profe&s;&s;ion or Opinion as <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> upon no Reli|gious
Di&s;pute, &s;uch as relates to Doctrine or Wor&s;hip&mdash;But purely
upon this &s;hort Que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>Whether they &s;hall be allow'd to keep open
Meeting-Hou&s;es, and Exerci&s;e their Mini&s;try among the Q&V;EEN's
Subjects, without acknowledging the Q&V;EEN's Authority?</HI></P>
<P>This is plainly proved, from the &s;ame Book we are an&s;wering,
<HI>Pag. 6. When People are libell'd on an Act of Parliament, which is li|mited
to one Per&s;on, and without any Word in that Act, that can ex|tend
to others,</HI> AS FOR EXAMPLE; The Libel charges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
That they are <HI>Guilty of the Breach of the Law, which requires that
Prayers be made for King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>becau&s;e they pray
not for Queen</HI> ANNE: Again, the <HI>Narrative</HI> pleads in their be|half,
<HI>pag.</HI> 13. That they are of <HI>Peaceable Principles, and quiet De|portment;</HI>
that in their Prayers, <HI>they are very careful to avoid giving
<PB N="2" REF="11">
Offince,</HI> for <HI>they u&s;e &s;uch Comprehen&s;ive Forms, as are &s;ufficient to pre|vent
all &s;u&s;picion of Di&s;re&s;pect,</HI> &s;uch as praying for THE SOVE|REIGN,
<HI>for</HI> THE <HI>Royal Family; for all Chri&s;tian Kings, Princes, and
Governours, for all our Rulers, &amp;c.</HI> and thus in <HI>pag. 10. We cannot
Di&s;&s;emble nor Contradict our known Principles as others, who as Intere&s;t
moves, can Addre&s;s, and make profe&s;&s;ions of Loyalty and Duty to the mo&s;t
oppo&s;ite and incon&s;i&s;tent Preten&s;ions; who can di&s;own a Prince in Misfor|tune,
who&s;e Title they once &s;olemnly Vouched, and can Vouch the Title
of another in pro&s;perous Circum&s;tances, who&s;e Right they will as readily
controvert,</HI>&mdash;&amp;c.</P>
<P>If the&s;e are not &s;ufficient to prove, what we have laid down as above,
the whole Proceedings as Narrated in their own Book will confirm it.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o appear very nece&s;&s;ary, to make the&s;e Things clear in the
Beginning&mdash;For &s;everal Rea&s;ons;</P>
<P>1. Becau&s;e it is ob&s;ervable, tho&s;e Gentlemen who are loude&s;t in the
Complaint of Per&s;ecution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> are forwarde&s;t to blend the
Church and the State together in this Affair; they are exceeding
loth, to have the Chiming Words, <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> &s;e|parated&mdash;And
what they have Joyned, they would have no Man
put a&s;under.</P>
<P>2. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the right under&s;tanding of an Accu&s;a|tion
of Per&s;ecution, that we determine who are the <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI> and
who the <HI>Per&s;ecuted;</HI> how el&s;e can we ever arrive at the Charge, or
enter into a proper Defence?</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Presbyterians, Qua.Presbyterians,</HI> are not concern'd in this
Affair, we &s;hall have the le&s;s to &s;ay about them; if we find them accu|&s;ed,
it is time to An&s;wer for them, when we &s;ee the Charge; at pre&s;ent
the Narrative has done them that Ju&s;tice, as to acknowledge, That the
Church-Judicatories <HI>did not concur</HI> in the Affair, <HI>neither by them&s;elves, or
by any one having their Mandat</HI> or Authority. <HI>Narrative, pag.</HI> 6.</P>
<P>It remains then to enter into the &s;hort Que&s;tion; Who are the <HI>Per&s;e|cutors,</HI>
and who the <HI>Per&s;ecuted?</HI> We begin with the latter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The per&s;ecuted,</HI> and tho&s;e are the <HI>Jacobite Clergy,</HI> or in <HI>Southern</HI> Eng|gli&s;h,
the <HI>Non-Jurant Clergy</HI> and their Hearers; whether they are
<HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> or otherwi&s;e, is not the Que&s;tion; nor are they enquir'd
after as to their Ordination, Profe&s;&s;ion, or Practice; &s;ave only as
<HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> &s;ome read the <HI>Engli&s;h Service,</HI> &s;ome read none; &s;ome
pray by Book, &s;ome without Book; but all are <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> as to
the QUEEN, refu&s;e to acknowledge the Government, and as
&s;uch they are now con&s;ider'd; if any others have been que&s;tioned,
we may examine their Ca&s;es apart, and the Rea&s;ons why they are
involved in the &s;ame Sentence.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12">
2. <HI>The Per&s;ecutors,</HI> are the Civil Magi&s;trates, &s;uch as the Provo&s;t, and
Bailiffs of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> the Sheriffs of Counties, Bayliffs of Burghs,
Stuarts of Stuartries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this by the expre&s;s Com|mand
and Direction of the Sovereign, and the Admini&s;tration; or
in Engli&s;h <HI>the Q&V;EEN and Council.</HI></P>
<P>We need not Notice here the Rea&s;ons, that made this Pro&s;ecution par|ticularly
nece&s;&s;ary at this Time; &s;uch as the un&s;ufferable In&s;ults offer'd
to the Government, by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party at Home; of which we might
give a long Hi&s;tory, or the impending Storm of an Inva&s;ion from the
Pretender Abroad; their Publickly owning the Pretender for their Law|ful
Sovereign, who was at that time preparing a <HI>French</HI> Power to De|po&s;e
the QUEEN, and Overturn the Government&mdash;The&s;e things,
tho' of &s;ufficient Weight in them&s;elves, and which would, if Arguments
of another Nature were not in the Ca&s;e, be allow'd able to ju&s;tify the
Government, we however omit here; they will often occur in the Proce&s;s
of the Story; but having laid down the two Preliminaries above, we
&s;hall put the Weight of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e upon Four Enquiries.&mdash;</P>
<P>1. Whether it ought to be expected, that any &s;ort of People &s;hould be
Tolerated, or Di&s;pen&s;ed with by the Government, who will not
acknowledge the Government?</P>
<P>And here we &s;hall find it nece&s;&s;ary to explain the Terms, what we
mean by being <HI>Tolerated</HI> and <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ed with</HI>&mdash;And what
we mean by <HI>Acknowledging the Government</HI>&mdash;The pre&s;ent Ca&s;e
being a little particular in them all.</P>
<P>2. Whether the QUEEN has not had &s;ufficient ju&s;tifyable Rea&s;ons,
both before GOD and Man, for ordering the &s;hutting up of the
Meeting-Hou&s;es in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for Pro&s;ecution of the Mini&s;ters?</P>
<P>And here it may be convenient to Examine, what we mean by
ju&s;tifyable Rea&s;ons in a QUEEN, what by &s;hutting up the Meet|ing-Hou&s;es,
and what by Pro&s;ecuting the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>3. Whether the Magi&s;trates in <HI>Scotland</HI> have done any thing illegally,
officou&s;ly, or any thing le&s;s or more than their Duty, in the Pro&s;e|cution
of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>4. Whether the Behaviour of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> has not ju&s;tly
brought this upon them&s;elves, and forc'd the Government to this
Proceeding with them?</P>
<P>The going thro' the&s;e Particulars, may perhaps be a full An&s;wer to
mo&s;t of the Heads of Complaint in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> which will
come in the way.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant, that two Things are &s;ugge&s;ted in Bar of what
is now laid down, tho' it does not appear, that either of them has been
prov'd, nor any &s;ufficient Ground given for the Sugge&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13">
1. That tho' the Magi&s;trates or Government are the Pro&s;ecutors, yet
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church are the Per&s;ecutors; the&s;e are the Incendi|aries,
the Informers, and the like&mdash;The other Party would think
it very hard, and that we &s;hould be very low in our Charity, <HI>and
they would have &s;ome Rea&s;on,</HI> if we &s;hould turn the Tables upon them,
<HI>and &s;ay,</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were indeed the Invaders, and the Pretender's
Name and Intere&s;t the outward Part of the Force invading&mdash;But
the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Gentry, and the Keepers up of
Meeting-Hou&s;es in <HI>Scotland, &amp;c.</HI> were the Incendiaries who gave
Encouragement to the Inva&s;ion it &s;elf, and were the Inviters of the
Pretender to di&s;turb the publick Repo&s;e&mdash;Now as this is not a
ju&s;t Way of drawing Con&s;equences, becau&s;e it carries with it no Evi|dence;
&s;o we would advi&s;e them not to legitimate the Practice by
their own Example, le&s;t it return upon them too &s;trongly.</P>
<P>2. That there are Meeting-Hou&s;es &s;hut up, and Mini&s;ters pro&s;ecuted,
who have qualified them&s;elves according to Law, and that there|fore
the Charge of Jacobiti&s;m is but a Pretence. Re&s;erving a more
full An&s;wer to this by examining Matter of Fact; we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve
for the pre&s;ent, that Jacobiti&s;m was the only moving Cau&s;e of
&s;etting up Meeting-Hou&s;es, as has been &s;ufficiently prov'd in the
World already; and Jacobiti&s;m has been the only moving Cau&s;e of
&s;hutting them up again; and this was manife&s;t in the very Pro&s;ecutions
in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where &s;everal, who&s;e Conver&s;ation was inoffen&s;ive, tho'
they were not qualified, had their Meetings left open; and when all
the re&s;t of the Meetings in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were clos'd, the&s;e preach'd un|di&s;turb'd,
<HI>and do &s;o &s;till</HI>&mdash;If others, tho' qualify'd, had not the &s;ame
Treatment, the&s;e Gentlemen ought not to bring it in as an Argu|ment
in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e it forces us &s;ay, what we do not de&s;ire to
make publick, and puts us to a Nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing the Gentlemens
Reputation, and di&s;covering the Crimes for which they had other
Treatment, <HI>Viz.</HI> Being legally depos'd from being Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Now, tho' by the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> they do
not find them&s;elves under any Obligation to forbear, even tho&s;e that
are qualified by taking the Oaths, who di&s;&s;ent from the Church&mdash;Nor
indeed can the Government of <HI>Britain by the &V;nion</HI> licen&s;e Men
to erect Meeting-Hou&s;es, tho' they did qualifie; yet there has al|ways
been an Inclination of Tenderne&s;s both in the Church and in the
Government; and there is no que&s;tion, but on a quiet and peaceable
Behaviour, they, who give rea&s;onable A&s;&s;urances to the Government
of their Fidelity to, and Acknowledgment of the QUEEN, would
find Forbearance, and always have found it: Therefore if any, who
have thus qualified, are at pre&s;ent Sufferers among the re&s;t, tho' we
do not grant it, they &s;uffer by being found in bad Company&mdash;And
may in a due Submi&s;&s;ion to Authority, no que&s;tion, find as much Fa|vour,
as their Behaviour can pretend to de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
But to return to our general Heads; We are now to examine,</P>
<P>(1.) Whether it ought to be expected, that any &s;ort of People &s;hould be
Tolerated, or Di&s;pen&s;ed with by the Government, who will not acknow|ledge
the Government?</P>
<P>And here we need not examin Antient-Hi&s;tory, or the Cu&s;tom of Foreign
Nations but rather put it upon the&s;e Gentlemen to tell us, at what Time,
or in what Country, any <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have been or are allow'd to enjoy
Liberty, without taking &s;uch Oaths, or giving &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of their
Fidelity and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Government, as by the Laws and Cu&s;toms
of that Country their Subjects were requir'd to give?&mdash;And here we
are willing to joyn with the <HI>Narrative, p.</HI> 16. in their <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Prote|&s;tant
Churches abroad.</P>
<P>In the next Place let them take the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of <HI>Britain,</HI>
as it now &s;tands under a Government, claim'd by a Pretender abroad,
and that Pretender <HI>not only</HI> cloath'd with the Titles and Honours of

to acknowledge him as Sovereign; <HI>but al&s;o</HI> acknowledg'd, pray'd
for, and his Preten&s;ions to the Crown defended, by the very People we
are now &s;peaking of, and who claim to be look'd upon as peaceable Sub|jects,
in whom the Government is &s;afe.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to enter into Examinations and Reflections on
particular Actions of Men; but &s;ince the Narrative pretends that the

peaceably, quietly and inoffen&s;ively, Narrat. p.</HI> 19. And that to
repre&s;ent them as dangerous to the Government, is to u&s;e them as the
<HI>Pagans did the Chri&s;tian Martyrs of Old, wrap them up in the Skins of Bea&s;ts,
that the Lyons that were let loo&s;e upon them, might de&s;troy up with the more
Violence, p.</HI> 18. We are oblig'd to &s;peak &s;omething of their Behaviour,
which we had rather have let fall, as not being forward to expo&s;e
them.</P>
<P>Not at all therefore to wrap them in any Dre&s;s but their own, neither
to mi&s;repre&s;ent, nor &s;o much as aggravate their Actions in particular, or
the Behaviour of their Party in general; let us but &s;tate the Ca&s;e between
the Church-Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the&s;e People, and the Govern|ment
of <HI>Britain</HI> and the&s;e People.</P>
<P>As to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is apparent, and even the <HI>Narrative,</HI>
tho' written with more Temper than the Writings of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Party
u&s;e to be written with, <HI>di&s;covers it</HI>&mdash;They treat them without the com|mon
Charity due to Chri&s;tians, even while the other return to them as
much Forbearance, as they are able to &s;hew with Safety to their E&s;tab|li&s;hment,
bearing their Intru&s;ions into their Churches, their Mobbings
and Rabling of their Mini&s;ters, and at the &s;ame time, contributing in
Charity to their Nece&s;&s;ities&mdash;Yet even in this very <HI>Narrative,</HI> they
upbraid them <HI>with being declared Enemies to all Power that will not &s;upport
<PB N="6" REF="15">
them,</HI> and kicking <HI>again&s;t all Authority that does not favour them,</HI> and all
along &s;hew their Inveteracy at the <HI>Fresbyterians,</HI> by di&s;owning them as
Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, and reproaching their Principles, on account of the
oppo&s;ition they formerly made, to the intollerable, illegal Oppre&s;&s;ions
of a Tyranny, tho' the &s;ame the whole Nation was afterwards oblig'd
to ca&s;t off, <HI>pag.</HI> 14.&mdash;Nor does it &s;eem rea&s;onable to brand the
<HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with taking up Arms at <HI>Pentland</HI> or <HI>Bothwel,</HI> a|gain&s;t
the &s;ame Tyranny and Barbarity, which being again&s;t all Law
and Rea&s;on, and lying &s;o heavy on that poor People, as that Human
Nature could no longer bear it; they only too ra&s;hly, and with TOO
WEAK a Force, oppo&s;ed that, which afterwards the whole I&s;land
kick'd off as intollerable, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms condemn'd,
as Illegal.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould the <HI>Jacobite Party,</HI> call the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> Rebels in this Ca&s;e,
till they give &s;ome farther A&s;&s;urance to the Government, that they them|&s;elves,
under far le&s;s Oppre&s;&s;ions, are not of the &s;ame Principles&mdash;And
let any Man that thinks this uncharitable, only refer to the Con|duct
of the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when the Pretender was upon the
Coa&s;t, their Joy when they expected his Landing, the Threats and In|&s;ults
of their Party upon the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and how they had mark'd
out the very Habitations of particular Per&s;ons to be Rabbled and Plun|der'd,
(perhaps wor&s;e)&mdash;And how the People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> began
to talk of &s;eeking to the <HI>French, if they had landed,</HI> for Protection from
the Barbarities of their own Epi&s;copal Rabbles; add to this the Chagrin
and Dejection of the whole Party, at the Defeat of a <HI>French</HI> Power,
and at the Di&s;appointment they were under, of not making good, what
they have commonly preach'd in their Meeting-Hou&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
had rather be under <HI>Popery</HI> than <HI>Presbytery.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>As to the Government,</HI> we forbear to enter into the particular Be|haviour
of Per&s;ons, being not willing to treat them with Invectives;
but while they make their Peaceable Behaviour an Argument, why the
pre&s;ent Government ought to think it &s;elf &s;afe it them; it obliges us in
behalf of the Government, a little to examine their Behaviour, in
order to make the Governments Proceeding with them appear, as it
really is, both Nece&s;&s;ary and Equitable.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> We are to remember, That with Force and Arms they
&s;tood out again&s;t this Government, and again&s;t the Revolution, as
long as their Power was able to re&s;i&s;t; That they were not &s;ubdued but
by the Sword, after they had fought the Forces of the Government at
<HI>Gilli$rankie,</HI> at <HI>Dunkeld,</HI> and in defending the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and
having obtain'd the Victory at the fir&s;t of the&s;e, gave us all &s;ufficient
occa&s;ion to know what they propo&s;ed, had not their General, the Vi&s;|count
of <HI>Dundee,</HI> been &s;lain in the Action, <HI>viz.</HI> Re&s;toring Epi&s;copacy with
the Tyranny and Cruelty of the former Reigns, under a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and &s;pu|$rious
Race.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">
Being thus reduc'd by the Sword, and Conquer'd, not having &s;ubmit|ted;
it &s;eems &s;omething A&s;&s;uming, to tell us now of their <HI>peaceable Beha|viour,</HI>
and the <HI>Safety of the Government,</HI> in giving them <HI>a full Liberty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2. Next it &s;eems proper to enquire, What it is they &s;eek a Liberty for.
The Narrative alledges, That it is merely in Matter of Religious Offices,
and complains of it, as</HI> a great Grievance and Mi&s;e$y, that the performing
of publick Offices of Religion &s;hould be clogg'd with Terms relating to State-Differences;
and that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are God's E&s;pecial Servants, &s;hould be
obliged to enter into the Deci&s;ion of publick Controver&s;i$s. <HI>Narr.</HI> p 18. <HI>Par.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>But let any Impartial People con&s;ider, Whether this Argument does
not turn directly upon them&mdash;That the Clergy, who by the E&s;pecial
Command of God in the Scripture, are commanded to be <HI>&s;ubject to the higher
Powers,</HI> which plainly infers obeying the Laws of the Land, and who are
commanded to pray for <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>All in Authority;</HI> &s;hould <HI>of them&s;elves</HI>
enter into the <HI>Deci&s;ion of State-Controver&s;ies, &s;uch as</HI> di&s;puting the Titles
of their Governours, refu&s;ing to pray for them, tho' the Laws of
the Land have ve&s;ted them with Supreme Authority&mdash;That the&s;e
Men &s;hould <HI>take upon them to</HI> enter into the <HI>Deci&s;ion of this State Contro|ver&s;y;</HI>
how far the meaning of a Law, obliging Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Per&s;ons to
pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> NOMINATIM was de&s;ign'd
to extend as to their Succe&s;&s;ors&mdash;And into <HI>this State-Controver&s;ie,</HI> how
far an Act, Ordaining Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pray for the pre&s;ent Queen, was
or was not extended; pre&s;uming to con&s;true it their own way, &s;o
as to mean only &s;uch as were Benefi'cd Mini&s;ters, and the like; &s;o that
'tis evident, the&s;e Gentlemen at the &s;ame time that they complain of it
as <HI>a Mi&s;ery and a Grievance, that they &s;hould be obliged to enter into State-Controver&s;ies,</HI>
do Voluntarily, and without Authority, make them&s;elves
Judges in State Controver&s;ies, take upon them to explain the Laws in
their own Favour, and then complain, that the Government is not plea|&s;ed
to accept of their Explanation, and to take the Laws in their Sen&s;e;
for which very thing one of the prime Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> was Sentenc'd
to the Scaffold, under the mild Di&s;pen&s;ation of their own Epi&s;copal Go|vernours.</P>
<P>This
therefore is the Ca&s;e, and the Narrative in that particular is not
Ju&s;t to the Matter of Fact&mdash;Their Mini&s;ters do voluntarily take
upon them to decide the State-Controver&s;ie of the Queen's Title to the
Crown; They refu&s;e to recognize Her Maje&s;ty's Authority, or pray
for her as Sovereign; and at the &s;ame time &s;ay, 'tis hard they &s;hould be
put to enter into the&s;e State-Controver&s;ies; whereas, on the other hand,
&s;peaking of them as Subjects, it rather &s;eems hard they &s;hould be &s;uffe'd
to enter into &s;uch Controver&s;ies, as di&s;pute the Title of their Sovereign,
much le&s;s be &s;uffer'd openly and avowedly, to acknowledge and pray for
a pretending Invader.</P>
<P>It cannot but be taken Notice of al&s;o, how Politickly the Narrative
in&s;inuates; That this Pro&s;ecution &s;eems Pointed at the <HI>Engli&s;h Service,
being introduc'd in</HI> Scotland, <HI>pag. 1. The chief occa&s;ion of this di&s;turbance,
<PB N="8" REF="17">
was the acceptance that the Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England <HI>met with in</HI> Scot|land,
<HI>pag.</HI> 15. But as this is not true in Fact, &s;o neither is the Pretence Ju&s;t;
&s;ince the Entertainment the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy finds in <HI>Scotland,</HI> even among
the Epi&s;copal People them&s;elves, is &s;o little, and the thing it &s;elf &s;o much
a Novelty to them, as being never practis'd, even in their own Epi&s;c$|pal
Days of Liberty; that it is not capable of giving them&s;elves any
Encouragement, or the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s; but of
this by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To this Behaviour of the Epi&s;copal Party, might be &s;ubjoyn'd their
general profe&s;s'd oppo&s;ition to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in the Union
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and their open de&s;iring and pleading for a Union with <HI>France,</HI>
which can fairly be fix'd upon them; which being con&s;ider'd, we refer
it to the Judgment of all Impartial People; whether the Government at
the &s;ame time, that an Inva&s;ion of a <HI>French</HI> Power, and a <HI>Frenchyfied</HI> Preten|der
was at the Door, in order to depo&s;e our Queen, de&s;troy the Succe&s;|&s;ion,
and di&s;&s;olve the Union, had not ju&s;t Rea&s;on to enquire, who was
with, and who again&s;t it; and to require all its Subjects to renew their
A&s;&s;urances of Fidelity.</P>
<P>Thus far as to the Behaviour of the Epi&s;copal Party in General; We
&s;hall enquire of the Behaviour of the Per&s;ons in particular, in another
Part of this Tract.&mdash;</P>
<P>&rindx; <HI>NOTE,</HI> This Di&s;cour&s;e will explain what we mean, by being
di&s;pen&s;ed with, Tolerated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> viz. That the Government having a
Party among them profe&s;t Enemies to the Sovereign, not reduc'd to
Obedience but BY BLOOD and Conque&s;t, &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with their
Allegiance, &s;uffer them unmole&s;ted without taking the Oaths; let the
People be encourag'd by Di&s;affection, by learning them in their Publick
Devotions, to pray for the Invaders of the Settlement, and treat the
QUEEN as an unnatural &V;&s;urper.</P>
<P>2. One would think, this were &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify Her Maje&s;ty, in
&s;hutting up the Meeting Hou&s;es in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and pro&s;ecuting the Mini|&s;ters&mdash;
But le&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem to be only too general, we mu&s;t de|&s;cend
here to the particular Rea&s;ons which Her Maje&s;ty had for this
Proceeding. And,</P>
<P>1. <HI>This may pa&s;s for one;</HI> That &s;uch was the height of Di&s;affection,
which the People who were the Supporters of the&s;e Mini&s;ters
were come to, by the Indulgence and Forbearance of the
Government, that even the <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Mini&s;ters them&s;elves
were not hot and intemperate enough for them; but if any
of them &s;eem'd enclin'd to acknowledge the Government, or pray
for the Queen, <HI>in Te&s;timony of their Peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> they would
not hear them; and this &s;everal of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters declared to
the Lord Provo&s;t of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> upon their Examination, and that
<PB N="9" REF="18">
being Peaceably di&s;po&s;ed, as it is hoped many of them are; they
were enclin'd to do their Duty, but that &s;uch was the Temper of
their Hearers, that if any of them had done &s;o, they would have
been rejected by the Party as <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> and not &s;upported in their
Mini&s;terial Employments.</P>
<P>Either this <HI>is true</HI> or it <HI>is fal&s;e;</HI> For the Truth of it we freely appeal,
<HI>First</HI> to the very Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, believing; &s;ince 'tis no Cha$ge
any one can be pro&s;ecuted for, they are too hone&s;t to deny it&mdash;And
next to the late Lord Provo&s;t and Magi&s;trates, to whom it was acknow|ledg'd&mdash;And
<HI>if this be true,</HI> we leave it to the Judgment of all the Pro|te&s;tant
Churches abroad, to whom the Narrative <HI>&s;eems willing to refer it
al&s;o, pag.</HI> 16, whether it be rea&s;onable &s;uch a Party of People &s;hould be
born with, <HI>much le&s;s Tolerated and Protected by the Government;</HI> whether
any Government now in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;uffers any of their Subjects to enjoy
&s;uch a Liberty <HI>on &s;uch T$rms;</HI> and whether any Prote&s;tant Church in
<HI>Europe</HI> behave them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner to the Government they
live under?</P>
<P>2. Nay &s;uch is the aver&s;ion among the Party, who are the &s;upport of
the&s;e Mini&s;ters, to the lea&s;t acknowledgment, or expre&s;&s;ion of
Duty to the Queen, that we are inform'd, and have great Rea&s;on
to believe it&mdash;That in the Di&s;tribution of the Charity collected
in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Relief of the Epi&s;copal Clergy
and their Di&s;tre&s;s'd Families, tho' that Charity was encourag'd by
the QUEEN her &s;elf, is chiefly be&s;tow'd by <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
and by &s;uch as acknowledge the QUEEN in both Nations,
and ought to be di&s;tributed <HI>at lea&s;t without &s;uch a Di&s;tinction</HI> to
all that were Nece&s;&s;itous; yet if any have been Peaceably enclin'd,
and have either quallifyed them&s;elves by taking the Oaths, or &s;hown
but their general good intention by praying for the Queen by
Name; they have thought fit to di&s;tingui&s;h them, by &s;triking them
out of their Roll, and refu&s;ing them any &s;hare in the Relief; and 'tis
hoped the Mini&s;ters concern'd will not put us to the Proof of this,
le&s;t &s;omething wor&s;e happen to appear with it&mdash;</P>
<P>3. The former Rea&s;ons proceed from the People &s;upporting the Mini|ni&s;ters;
Let us next examine a little, what may relate to the Mini&s;ters
them&s;elves, in which we &s;hall be as tender as po&s;&s;ible; we have indeed
much &s;aid in the <HI>Narrative</HI> of their Peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition, their inoffen&s;ive
Behaviour, and how &s;afe the Government is in them&mdash;But we cannot but
ask any con&s;idering Per&s;on, to weigh the Thing taken complexly: For <HI>be
it &s;o,</HI> that the behaviour of the Mini&s;ters was Peaceable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to their pri|vate
Conver&s;ation&mdash;Yet can any Body &s;ay, the Government is &s;afe in them,
<PB N="10" REF="19">
who keep up open A&s;&s;emblies of conquer'd Enemies; for &s;uch their Party are,
who fir&s;t having fought in the Field again&s;t the pre&s;ent Settlement to the
Effu&s;ion of a great deal of Blood, and own'd their De&s;igns of re&s;toring
Tyranny Sword in Hand&mdash;Now by way of Faction and Party, openly
to avow <HI>Jacobite Principles,</HI> di&s;own the Government, and in their <HI>Meet|ing-Hou&s;es</HI>
and <HI>Religious Wor&s;hip,</HI> with their Spiritual Weapons, <HI>the Carnal
ones foiling,</HI> carry on the &s;ame War, and continue to fight again&s;t the
QUEEN$s Authority&mdash;Will any fine Words cover this Fraud? will
any one &s;ay, that praying for the QUEEN's Enemies is a Peaceable Prin|ciple,
and refu&s;ing to pray for the Lawful Sovereign, an inoffen&s;ive Be|haviour?</P>
<P>4.
This Practice is an Active Offence to the Government, and in its
Nature dangerous, &s;ince it is a nouri&s;hing and keeping up a Faction a|gain&s;t
the Government, and in&s;tructing the People in Principles pernicious
to the &s;afety of the Pre&s;ent Government&mdash;Conveying to Po&s;terity
the Poi&s;on of Di&s;affection, and pre&s;erving a Succe&s;&s;ion to <HI>Jacobite Princi|ples;</HI>
and will they &s;ay the Government is &s;afe in this, or that any Go|vernment,
that had their Eyes open to their own Intere&s;t, would &s;uffer
it?&mdash;Suppo&s;e they think the&s;e Principles ju&s;t&mdash;Yet when they are
&s;peaking to per&s;wade the Government to for bear them, they mu&s;t &s;peak
to the Intere&s;t and Security of the Government; can any Government
be &s;afe in the encrea&s;ing and promoting the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e that will
not acknowledge that Government? Can the QUEEN think her &s;elf
&s;afe in the encrea&s;ing the number of her profe&s;t Enemies? Can Her Ma|je&s;ty
ju&s;tify it to her own Peace, and the Nations Satisfaction, to pro|tect
tho&s;e that di&s;own her, and think her &s;elf &s;afe in tho&s;e that did fight
again&s;t her; and when they can do that no longer by the Sword, conti|nue
to do it by all the Weapons they have left?&mdash;That pray again&s;t
her, and in&s;truct Po&s;terity to pray again&s;t her, and put forth their $t|mo&s;t
to encrea&s;e the number of tho&s;e that pray again&s;t her, that if po&s;|&s;ible
they may in time become &s;trong enough again, to take up the Sword
and fight again&s;t her as they did before?</P>
<P>If it be objected, this relates &s;till to the People, not the Mini&s;ters:
We an&s;wer, it relates e&s;pecially to the Mini&s;ters, who being their In|&s;tructors,
both in Doctrine and Example, are particularly In&s;trumental,
in keeping up, encouraging and maintaining Principles prefectly incon&s;i|&s;tent
with the &s;afety of the Government among their Hearers.</P>
<P>2. The equivocal manner of praying, &s;eems to be a mo&s;t unan&s;we|rable
Charge upon the Mini&s;ters in Per&s;on, who appear guilty of preva|ric$ting
either with GOD or Man, or with both; in putting up
Words in the &s;olemn Duty of Prayer, and the Wor&s;hip of GOD, which
either are equivocal in their De&s;ign, or may be taken &s;o by their People,
<HI>and which they them&s;elves make u&s;e of equivocally upon occa&s;ion;</HI> it lyes at their
Door to defend the Morality of it, particularly &s;ince they manife&s;tly
offer them up to GOD in one Sence, and pleaded them before the Ma|gi&s;trates
in another&mdash;For <HI>Example,</HI> praying for THE QUEEN, either
<PB N="11" REF="20">
when they offered the&s;e Words to the Magi&s;trates, it was to excu&s;e them|&s;elves,
and &s;ignify, that the Words were capable of being under&s;tood
of QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> or it was not; <HI>if it was not,</HI> they would find
it difficult to &s;ay, to what End they mentioned them; <HI>if it was,</HI> it is
apparent, they equivocated with the Magi&s;trates in that Plea, or equi|vocated
with GOD Almighty in their Prayers; nor would one of them,
(which &s;hewed them Men of &s;ome Hone&s;ty), venture to &s;ay upon their Ve|racity,
that they in their Prayers meant, or &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to be
under&s;tood by their Hearers, to mean QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> whom had
they declin'd to name, they might ea&s;ily have di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the
Words, PROTESTANT QUEEN; &s;o that this Equivocation
was a ju&s;t Aggravation of the Crime, and plainly reflects on the Morals
of the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>3. If it be the Misfortune of &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Temper may be
otherwi&s;e peaceable and inoffen&s;ive, to fall into this Error, the Govern|ment
cannot help it, and we are &s;orry for it&mdash;But to &s;ay their Beha|viour
is peaceable and inoffen&s;ive, who act in all the Ways their Circum|&s;tances
have left them, again&s;t the Queen and the Government, is to &s;ay
nothing, nor can it plead for any For bearance to them. <HI>For Example,</HI>
The poor, hone&s;t, innocent People of <HI>France,</HI> the Merchants and Pai&s;ants
of the remote Countries, their Behaviour to us is innocent and inoffen|&s;ive;
yet as they are in the Cau&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Power, and there by are Ene|mies
to the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> we land upon them, plunder them, bombard
them, take their Ships, and impri&s;on their Seamen&mdash;And 'tis very ju&s;t to
do &s;o, <HI>for they are profe&s;&s;ed Enemies,</HI> they &s;upport the Grand Enemy, they
a&s;&s;i&s;t again&s;t us in their Degree, and to the utmo&s;t, tho' otherwi&s;e they
mean no ill&mdash;<HI>The Jacobite Party,</HI> (and Mini&s;ters e&s;pecially) they a&s;&s;i&s;t
again&s;t the Peace of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, with all their po&s;&s;ible En|deavours,
they encourage the Party in di$owning the Goverment, refu&s;e
to pray for the Sovereign, and thus all their peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition ends
in this, that in &s;hort they oppo&s;e the Government in every thing they
can&mdash;Their Power was broke by Force, otherwi&s;e they had continued
to oppo&s;e us with Arms, and 'tis owing to our Victory over them, that
they are not in actual Rebellion at this Day; with what Weapons they
have, they fight us &s;till, <HI>Viz.</HI> Their Tongues to Men, and their Prayers
to God; and after all this, the Narrative would fain per&s;wade us, that
the Government is &s;afe in the&s;e Men, that they are of a peaceable Di&s;po|&s;ition,
and an inoffen&s;ive Behaviour.</P>
<P>This, we think, an&s;wers what is premis'd in the &s;econd Query, <HI>viz.</HI>
What we mean by ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;ons in the the Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a few
Words&mdash;&startq;That her Maje&s;ty is nece&s;&s;itated by their Principles and
Behaviour to interpo&s;e her Power for the publick Safety, to &s;uppre&s;s
this Party, and to prevent the Encrea&s;e of their Numbers by checking
their A&s;&s;emblies, and obliging their Mini&s;ters, either to give bette
<PB N="12" REF="21">
A&s;&s;urances of their peaceable Principles, or for bear poi&s;oning the Peo|ple
by their In&s;tructions and Example&endq;</P>
<P>If as an Accident to this Nece&s;&s;ity, the Wor&s;hip of God <HI>in their Way</HI> is
interrupted to any, who are &s;incerely &s;crupulous of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Way,
and tenacious of the Epi&s;copal Rites; any Body that knows the Queen,
and knows her Maje&s;ty's Pious Intentions, her own Religious Profe&s;&s;ion
of the Prote&s;tant Religion in an Epi&s;copal Church, her Zeal for her own
Opinion, her Charity for all con&s;cientious People, tho' differing in Opi|nion
from her &s;elf, and her Maje&s;ty's general Tenderne&s;s for all her Sub|jects
without Exception, mu&s;t clear the Queen of the Reproach, the&s;e
People would throw upon her of per&s;ecuting Epi&s;copacy&mdash;Since what|ever
Profe&s;&s;ion the&s;e People make, and whatever Liberty they have had,
has met with no other Interruption in the whole Reign of her Maje&s;ty,
than what for the foregoing Rea&s;ons has been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the
Safety and Peace of the Goverment.</P>
<P>Not whatever have been the Pretences of &s;ome People, and whatever
the Narrative it &s;elf may aleadge; Has any Mini&s;ter been &s;ilenc'd, or any
Meeting-Hou&s;e &s;hut up, <HI>other than as here after is expre&s;s'd,</HI> but &s;uch as where
the Mini&s;ter officiating has been known to di&s;own the Government, or re|fu&s;e
praying for the Queen, as will more particularly appear by the whole
judical Proce&s;s Defences and Sentences pa&s;s'd in this Ca&s;e in the City of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> annex'd to this Work. It &s;eems therefore &s;ome Reflection
upon &s;he Veracity of the Narrative, and upon the Reputation of its Au|thor,
to &s;ay, That the not qualifying was only a Pretence, and that tho&s;e
that did qualifie, were equally pro&s;ecuted with tho&s;e that did not: The
contrary to which is manife&s;t, as will appear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>But above all, the Inju&s;tice of this <HI>Narrative,</HI> and its Reflection upon
Her Maje&s;ty, will appear in examining an In&s;inuation, which upon &s;econd
View will appear to have no manner of Foundation, other than
in the Policy of the Author, who might think perhaps to make his Ar|gument
popular in <HI>England</HI> by &s;uch an <HI>Introduction</HI>&mdash;And this is in
the very fir&s;t Paragraph, where he &s;ays, <HI>The Pro&s;ecution being begun ju&s;t
before</HI> Ea&s;ter, <HI>it was obvious, the De&s;ign was to hinder or di&s;turb the Peo|ples
Devotions, which they were wont to practice at that time;</HI> and particu|larly
it &s;ays, <HI>a Citation was given to &s;ome who u&s;ed the Engli&s;h Form of Ser|vice
in their Chappel.</HI> Pag. 1.</P>
<P>Again, in another Place; <HI>The chief occa&s;ion of this di&s;turbance, was the accep|tance
that Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England <HI>meets with in</HI> Scotland, <HI>&s;o as it
is come publickly to be practi&s;ed, and People re&s;ort to tho&s;e Occa&s;ions with much
$delight, both at</HI> Edinburgh, <HI>and at many other Placesin the Country.</HI> Narrat <HI>pag</HI> 15</P>
<P>This is a Di&s;covery of a Politick in the Author unhappily cla&s;hing,
<HI>First</HI> with Charity; <HI>Secondly</HI> with Truth; And, <HI>Thirdly</HI> with it &s;elf.</P>
<P>With the <HI>First,</HI> to alledge that this Pro&s;ecution is not for the Safety
of the Government, but purely to &s;uppre&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy,</HI> in which
the Author Mal-treats the QUEEN and the whole Mini&s;try, who are
known to be eminently Zealous for, and firm in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="13" REF="22">
Prote&s;tant Religion in an <HI>Epi&s;eopal Church,</HI> and by whom, and by who&s;e
e&s;pecial Order the&s;e Pro&s;ecutions, and all the Proceedings thereupon,
<HI>being impartially repre&s;ented to them,</HI> were ju&s;tifyed and approved by the
QUEEN and Council, and the Magi&s;trates in all Places in <HI>Scotland,</HI> orde|red
to proceed farther, to the effectual &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, as
Dangerous to the Government, and de&s;tructive to the Publick Peace, as
may be &s;een by Her Maje&s;ty's Letter to the Lord Advocate of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
Dated $span$ and Counter-Sign'd by the Right Honourable
the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Principal Secretary of State.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We mu&s;t take leave to ob&s;erve, that in this the <HI>Narrative</HI>
cla&s;hes with the Truth of Fact, and a little with it &s;elf; for that it
&s;ays the Citation was <HI>given to &s;ome who u&s;ed the Engli&s;h Service in their Chap|pels.</HI>
Narrat. <HI>p.</HI> 1. This any Body will allow a Reader to under&s;tand to
mean, <HI>to &s;uch only,</HI> or el&s;e it would &s;eem to be &s;poken with no Significa|tion
at all.</P>
<P>Now the Fact here is very plain, the Pro&s;ecution was not Special a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e that did, or did not u&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, but again&s;t
tho&s;e that did or did not take the Oath of Allegiance, and Sign the &s;ame
with the A&s;&s;urance, and pray for the Queen as the Law directs; and
the fir&s;t Libel, the very &s;ame which follow'd the Citations, was a|gain&s;t
&s;eventeen Mini&s;ters in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> one fourth Part of
whom did not u&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy,</HI> and this the <HI>Narrative</HI> acknow|ledges,
<HI>pag.</HI> 25, and 26, where in an <HI>Appendix,</HI> it gives the Copy of the
Libel, and the Names of 17 or 18 Mini&s;ters who are pro&s;ecuted in it;
and therefore it &s;eems this Sugge&s;tion of the Narrative, <HI>That only &s;uch
as u&s;ed the</HI> Engli&s;h Liturgy <HI>were cited,</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t with it &s;elf any
more than with the Truth of Fact.</P>
<Q><HI>And this brings us directly to the Third Enquiry,</HI> viz.
Whether the Magi&s;trates in <HI>Scotland</HI> have done any thing illegally, offi|cou&s;ly,
or any thing le&s;s or more than their Duty, in the Pro&s;ecution
of the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> in <HI>Scotland?</HI></Q>
<P>This Enquiry is very needful in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and may &s;erve to
give Light to &s;ome things, in which the <HI>Narrative, and indeed the whole
Epi&s;copal Party</HI> before the writing this Book, and &s;ince al&s;o, very much
impo&s;e upon the World.</P>
<P>Particularly they would &s;eem to in&s;inuate, as before, (1) That this
Pro&s;ecution is the Act and Deed of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> ab&s;tra|ctly,
con&s;ider'd, and not of the Government. (2.) That it is their Act and
Deed as <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and Pointed at the Church, meerly as <HI>Epi&s;copal.</HI>
(3.) That it is their Act and Deed as <HI>Scots Presbyterians,</HI> and particularly
levell'd at the Church of <HI>England</HI> Service, which was ju&s;t going to be
introduc'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e is effectually an&s;were'd, by affirming <HI>what is mo&s;t
ture, viz.</HI> That this whole Pro&s;ecution has been the meer Act of the Go|vernment;
which Government being, as is noted, wholly <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> it can|not
be imagin'd without great Inju&s;tice, the QUEEN had any regard
in it but to the Publick Safety; and therefore, together with the former
Circum&s;tances, it is evident, that nothing but the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs,
the Danger of Foreign Inva&s;ions, and the growing forwardne&s;s of a
Party at Home, moved the Government to take this Cour&s;e to pre&s;erve
it&s;elf.&mdash;Not that if the&s;e particular Circum&s;tances had not now con|curr'd,
the Government had been under any Obligation to protect
them, while they refu&s;ed to comply with what the Law expected of
Faithful Subjects, of <HI>which-hereafter</HI>&mdash;But as to the Fact in hand, no|thing
was done to re&s;train the Liberty they enjoy'd, till about the End
of <HI>February,</HI> 1708&mdash;The very time the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was expected every
Hour upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland;</HI> this the <HI>Narrative</HI> acknowledges, in the
very fir&s;t Words of it&mdash;For it begins thus: <HI>In the Month of</HI> March, 1708.
<HI>after the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters in the Meeting-Hou&s;es of this Place</HI> (Edinburgh)
<HI>had for &s;everal Years continued in the Exerci&s;e of their Mini&s;try, they were
&s;urpriz'd with the Notice of a Citation</HI>&mdash;It had been very ju&s;t if they
had added, Occa&s;ioned by the alarm of an Inva&s;ion, intended to be made by
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> whom all or mo&s;t part of the&s;e Mini&s;ters and their Hearers ac|knowledg'd
for their Sovereign, prayed for, and gave the Government Rea&s;on
to apprehend they had encourag'd to make this attempt.</P>
<P>This Matter being cleared up, the Second and <HI>Third</HI> Sugge&s;tions, <HI>viz.</HI>
of this Pro&s;ecution being the Act of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> of <HI>Scotland
as &s;uch,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters as &s;uch,</HI> and agin&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h
Service,</HI> fall to the Ground together&mdash;For 'tis acknowledg'd
in the fir&s;t Line of the <HI>Narrative,</HI> That they enjoy'd their Liberty
for &s;everal Years before, till <HI>March,</HI> 1708. (<HI>viz.</HI>) till the very Month
the Pretender appear'd upon the Coa&s;t&mdash;And if it was not time
for the Government to &s;tir to take away all the hopes of &s;uch an
Attempt, and to abridge the Liberty of the Friends to that Intere&s;t,
let our Enemices them&s;elves be Judges.</P>
<P>It might be ob&s;erv'd indeed here, That the <HI>Epi&s;copal People</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
endeavouring to introduce the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy into <HI>Scotland</HI> at this
time, had &s;everal things in it, which did not at all prove the Peacea|ble
Di&s;po&s;ition of the Party nor the Hone&s;ty of their De&s;ign; for with|out
looking back to the Di&s;turbances, which the like Attempt former|ly
producd in that Nation, and the Aver&s;ion of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to
&s;uch Novelties; it is apparent, it was not for any particular Re&s;pect to,
or Approbation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, that they attempted now to &s;et it up
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> for it might then be ask'd, why they never made any attempt
to introduce it in <HI>Scotland</HI> for 28 Year, from the Re&s;toration to the Re|volution,
when they had &s;o entirely &s;ubjected the People, that they could
<PB N="15" REF="24">
impo&s;e almo&s;t any thing upon them&mdash;If then they had a true Zeal
for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, they would not have failed to have brought it in
while they had the Power in thier hands&mdash;Nor is the delight of the
People in the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI> any le&s;s an ab&s;urdity than the other,
&s;ince they that know the Hi&s;tory of the late Times, know niether King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. nor the Clergy ever dur&s;t make the Attempt to re&s;tore it, tho,
they had enclin'd to it, becau&s;e they knew the People would not be brought
to it&mdash;How it &s;hould come to pa&s;s that <HI>Scotland</HI> is &s;o changed, and that
the love of the <HI>Common- Prayer</HI> &s;hould be now &s;o great, &s;ince the fall of
<HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> would be &s;trange; if we did not know that the Fact is not
really true, and that the whole Project is but to form a Divi&s;ion, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the <HI>Engli&s;h Epi&s;copal Church</HI> with Prejudices again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> on one
hand, as if Per&s;ecuting the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> becau&s;e of the Liturgy; and with
an Opinion of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Scots</HI> on the other hand, as all one with them|&s;elves;
whereas it is evident, while they had the Government in their
own hands, they never regarded their Union with the <HI>Engli&s;h Church,</HI> nor
received or attempted to receive the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service into their Churches.</P>
<P>Nor is it at all obliging to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the fir&s;t appear|ance
of entertaining the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy,</HI> begins among the Enmies to
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, for &s;uch the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> and their Hearers mu&s;t be;
The pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>England</HI> being accounted Schi&s;matical
by the <HI>Jacobite Clergy</HI> here, and con&s;equently by them.&mdash;-</P>
<P>Nor can this courting the Church of <HI>England</HI> here, be any thing but
a feint with de&s;ign to make Divi&s;ions; &s;ince were the&s;e Men to be re&s;to|red
by the influence of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> they could not joyn with
one another, with any manner of con&s;i&s;tency with their re&s;pective Prin|ciples:
For Example, If the <HI>Jacobite Party</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> joyn'd with the
the Church of <HI>England;</HI> they mu&s;t joyn with them in Per&s;ecuting and
Depriving all the <HI>Non-Jurant</HI> Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> who are here Depo&s;ed
for the &s;ame thing, for which the&s;e Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> are Pro&s;ecuted;
they mu&s;t own them ju&s;tly turn'd out, and &s;tand by and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Church
of <HI>England</HI> in doing it&mdash;And this would be incon&s;i&s;tent with them, as
being <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> them&s;elves: If on the other hand the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
joyned with the <HI>Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters</HI> we are &s;peaking of in <HI>Scotland;</HI>
they mu&s;t then &s;et their hands to that Non-Jurant Principle in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which they them&s;elves per&s;ecute in <HI>England;</HI> they mu&s;t deny the Revo|lution,
own them&s;elves Rebels, and their Queen an U&s;urper&mdash;Thus
this introducing the Liturgy into <HI>Scotland,</HI> can have no De&s;ign to bring
the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> to unite; <HI>for it is im|po&s;&s;ible,</HI>
it is not in Love to the Service; <HI>for then, why did they not &s;how it,
when they had the Power in their hands?</HI> And it is not to oblige the People
of <HI>Scotland</HI> as de&s;iring it, <HI>for it is certain they would never bear it,</HI> but it is
purely to form a Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> There is not a little Rea&s;on to doubt the Matter of Fact &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
<HI>Narrat. p.</HI> 15. viz. <HI>The Acceptance the</HI> English <HI>Liturgy meets with;</HI>
&s;ince 'tis well known, their own People do not like it; &s;everal of their
<PB N="16" REF="25">
own Mini&s;ters could never be per&s;waded to u&s;e it; <HI>no, not &s;ome of the&s;e
now under Per&s;ecution;</HI> and upon the introducing it into other of their
Meeting Hou&s;es, many of their Hearers went from them on that Occa|&s;ion,
and they cannot name Ten of their Meetings in the whole Kingdom
that can bring the People to make u&s;e of it now, after all the Attempts
made to reconcile them to it; neitherwill their Objection hold, that this is
a hindrance to Religion, and expo&s;ing the People to omitting Divine Wor|&s;hip;
for tho&s;e that are meerly Epi&s;copal in Judgment, and not concer|ned
in the&s;e Politick Controver&s;ies, that is, are not <HI>Jacobites,</HI> either at|tend
the Mini&s;try of &s;uch Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, as are now preaching in
the Church, <HI>and who are at lea&s;t an eighth Part of the whole B$nefic'd Mini|&s;try
of Scotland;</HI> or content them&s;elves to hear the <HI>Presbyterian Mini&s;ters</HI>
preach, joyning in Communion with the other as they have occa&s;ion&mdash;Now
'tis obvious, not one of the&s;e Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters u&s;e the Liturgy
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or any other pre&s;crib'd Forms, but take the
Oaths to the Government and are protected by it; but this eminent
Zeal for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, for whih the Church of <HI>England</HI> is invited
to embrace the&s;e Men as Brethren, is only &s;een among the profe&s;s'd Ene|mies
of the Queen and Government; the &s;ame the Church of <HI>England</HI>
has expunged and ca&s;t out, and not thought them fit to be allowed the
Exerci&s;e of their Mini&s;terial Offices in the whole Kingdom, tho' other|wi&s;e
as able, as well quallifyed, as duly ordain'd, and of Behavour as
Inoffen&s;ive, and as Peaceable as any of the&s;e Gentlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> will
pretend to be.</P>
<P>We come now to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who&s;e Part in the Ma|nagemet
of this Matter, notwith&s;tanding all the Clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t
them, has been, 1. Legal, with re&s;pect to the Law, except only the Sin of
Lenity and Mitigation of the Rigour the Law would have ju&s;tifyed.
2. Merciful in every Part, in which they could &s;hew Mercy, with a due
regard to, and con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice and their Duty to their Soverign.
3. Charitable to the Per&s;ons of the Mini&s;ters, and to their Circum&s;tan|ces;
and this will lead us into a full <HI>Narrative,</HI> al&s;o of the Proceedings
from their Beginning; of which the <HI>Narrative</HI> we are &s;peaking to is but
a part.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for the Legality of the Proceedings of the Magi&s;trates, $word$
will be nece&s;&s;ary to look back to the Beginning of their fir&s;t citing
before them, the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters who kept Meeting-Hou&s;es in
<HI>Edinburgh:</HI> And here it appears,</P>
<P>&startq;That about the End of <HI>Feb.</HI> 170 7/8. Her Maje&s;ty by Her Royal Letter
to the Privy-Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> gave Notice of the intended Inva&s;ion,
back'd with a <HI>French</HI> Power de&s;ign'd again&s;t <HI>Scotland;</HI> recommending to
them the &s;ecurity of the Kingdom, the Pre&s;ervation of the Publick
Peace, and that they would u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to that Effect.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="26">
&startq;The Privy-Council taking this Affair into their Con&s;ideration, it
naturally occurr'd; That to di&s;courage the Enemies of the Government
at Home, was <HI>among others,</HI> one of the be&s;t &s;teps to prevent the mi&s;|chievous
Con&s;equences of an Inva&s;ion from Abroad; and in order to
this, that it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppre&s;s the Publick Meetings of tho&s;e,
who under pretence of Divine Wor&s;hip, admitted &s;uch Mini&s;ters to
officiate, as the Law in that Ca&s;e had prohibited, having not qualifyed
them&s;elves by taking the Oaths, praying for the QUEEN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
by which the Publick Di&s;affection was upheld and encourag'd.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>NOTE,</HI> Here is the Original of this Per&s;ecution, plainly trac'd
to the <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion, and the Danger of the State; not their being
Epi&s;copal, but their being Jacobite; not their u&s;ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Litur|turgy,
but their not praying for the QUEEN, are the Rea&s;ons of their
fir&s;t Di&s;turbance&mdash;<HI>For till now,</HI> the <HI>Narrative</HI> owns they had
been for &s;evral Years unmole&s;ted. <HI>Narrat.</HI> pag. 1.</P>
<P>&startq;It was then agreed to <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> in the Privy-Council;
<HI>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of the Coun|cil
for Proof;</HI> That Orders &s;hould be I&s;&s;ued out to all inferiour Magi|&s;trates,
to put this Re&s;olve in Execution; and Orders were according|ly
I&s;&s;ued out to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, who
thereupon Legally called before them &s;everal Mini&s;ters or Preachers,
who were known to keep Publick Meeting-Hou&s;es within their Bounds&mdash;Asking
them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for
Her Maje&s;ty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> in their Publick Meeting-Hou&s;es; and
if they had quallifyed them&s;elves by taking the Oath of Allegiance,
and &s;ub&s;cribing the &s;ame with the A&s;&s;urance, as the Law requir'd?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Some of them an&s;wer'd directly, but others avoiding the Que&s;tion,
requir'd a Legal Trayl, by way of Libel and Proof; which was ac|cordingly
Appointed, and whereof the preci&s;e Points were, <HI>for which,
me appeal, even to the Draught in the Narrative it &s;elf;</HI> their not taking
the Oath of Allegiance, and &s;ub&s;cribing the &s;ame with the A&s;&s;urance;
their not praying for Her Maje&s;ty <HI>NOMINATIM,</HI> as the Law re|quires;
and their not ob&s;erving Publick Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings; all
which were Notour, and being Negatives proved them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>And here the Reader is to take Notice, That the <HI>Narrative</HI> in its Account of
the&s;e Proceedings, gives very unfairly a large Account of the Defences of
the Mini&s;ters, but tells us <HI>the Magi&s;trates repell'd all their Dilators and
Defences;</HI> and &s;o immediately brings them in <HI>Di&s;cerning and Ordaining,</HI>
that is, giving Sentence, as if they had done it Arbitrarily, and without
any Form; but upon a fair relating of the Fa&s;t, it will appear, the Ma|gi&s;trates
with their <HI>Repelling,</HI> that is, <HI>Over-ruling</HI> their Defences,
gave fair and Legal Arguments and Rea&s;ons, &s;uch as could not by Law
<PB N="18" REF="27">
be objected again&s;t, for their &s;aid <HI>Repelling</HI> and <HI>Over-ruling,</HI> as will
appear by this following Account of the whole Matter&mdash;Which we pre|&s;ent
to the World from the very Court where it was tran&s;acted, and have
it under the Hand of the proper Per&s;ons, who can give Authority to it,
and have re&s;erved the Original for any one to &s;ee, that may que&s;tion the
Exactue&s;s of this Relation.</P>
<P>&startq;To this Libel the fore&s;aid Preachers made An&s;wers, and al&s;o took a
Prote&s;t, That they were not legally cited, not being call'd either on fif|teen
Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days as the late Act of
Parliament again&s;t Intruders pre&s;cribes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To which it was an&s;wer'd, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and
perpetual Cu&s;tom within Burgh had over-ruled it to 24 Hours; and as
to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Trail of Intruders.
But the Preachers call'd, being conven'd for notour Di&s;affection by
not praying, and by not taking the Oath of Allegiance, nor keeping
Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings, the Citations were good, and the Procedure
unque&s;tionable; and yet the Magi&s;trates thought fit to give them a
farther Indulgence, and to allow them to give in all their Defences.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Sum of which Defences, as contain'd in a Repre&s;entation exhibit
by the &s;aid Preachers, being fir&s;t the fore&s;aid Dilators to this, they ad|ded,
That by the Act of Parliament 1693, requiring all Mini&s;ters and
Preachers to take the Oath of Allegiance, It is provided, that the Con|travener
&s;hall be puni&s;h'd by Bani&s;hment, or otherways as the Privy-Council
&s;hould think fit, and therefore the Libel was improperly tabled
before the Magi&s;trates.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was an&s;wer'd, To the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Dilators, that the former An&s;wers were
repeated; And to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> That the Privy-Council having refer'd
the Execution to the Magi&s;trates, there could be no more Debate about
their Competency on that Head.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But then the Preachers went on to object again&s;t the Relevancy. And
as to the Act of the Convention ordaining all Mini&s;ters to pray for the
King and Queen <HI>Nominatim,</HI> They an&s;wer'd, That that Act did die and
expire with King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> And as to the Act 1693,
ordaining all Preachers to take $$e Oath of Allegiance, and &s;ign the
&s;ame with the A&s;&s;urance; They an&s;wer'd, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That that Act did only
concern Mini&s;ters provided to Benefices and Stipends, and could not be
extended to &s;uch Preachers, as enjoy no Benefice under the Government;
And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Act recognizing Her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>ANNE</HI> enjoyns
the Taking of the Oath of Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;uch as are in publick
Tru&s;t, and Preachers not benefic'd cannot be &s;aid to be in any publick
Tru&s;t; And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Act of Parliament 1693, limited to the Per|&s;ons
of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> is out of Doors with them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To which it was reply'd, That the Act of Convention, ordaining all
Mini&s;ters and Preachers to pray for the King and Queen <HI>Nominatim,</HI> is
certainly to be under&s;tood, likeways of all their Royal Succe&s;&s;ors, &s;pe|cially
<PB N="19" REF="28">
&s;ince it is &s;o plainly founded upon the Command of the Apo&s;tle,
and the Duties of all Subjects. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Act 1693, expre&s;ly relates
to all Preachers, whether benefic'd or not, and withal defines all Prea|chers
to be Per&s;ons in publick Tru&s;t; &s;o that the Act recognizing Her
Maje&s;ty did exactly fall in within it, and affords no Releif to the De|fenders.
And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Act 1693, tho' it mention King <HI>William</HI>
and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet is not limited to them, but being a perpetual Law,
extends to all their Royal Succe&s;&s;ors; likeas by the &s;aid Act recognizing
Her Maje&s;ty, it is <HI>de facto</HI> &s;o extended.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Which Defences and Replies being read and con&s;ider'd by the Magi|&s;trates,
they repell'd the Dilators, as al&s;o all the other Defences pro|poned
for the Defenders, and &s;ound, that &s;ince they had not pray'd for
Her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>ANNE, Nominatim,</HI> and taken the Oath of Allegi|ance,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore ordain'd
them, and every one of them, to de&s;i&s;t from keeping of any Meeting-Hou&s;es
within the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Liberties thereof, and from
preaching or exerci&s;ing any Part of the Mini&s;terial Function within the
&s;ame in time coming, under the Pain of Impri&s;onment, and to find Cau|tion
for that Effect betwixt and the <HI>30th</HI> Day of <HI>March</HI> then in&s;tant, and
in the mean time that their Meeting Hou&s;es be forthwith &s;hut up. But
tho' this Sentence was then pa&s;t, yet nothing follow'd upon it, until that
the Privy-Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> being determin'd by an Act of Parlia|ment,
after the 1&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> the&s;e di&s;affected Preachers judging, that the
Councils Orders were al&s;o expir'd with the Council that gave them,
did about the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> fall again to their Preaching, and enter'd
their Meeting-Hou&s;es. And farther they re&s;olv'd among them&s;elves, that
they would continue to preach and not de&s;i&s;t; which mov'd the Magi|&s;trates
to renew the former Prohibition about the &s;aid <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t,
which they &s;till neglecting and de&s;pi&s;ing were again call'd before the
Magi&s;trates about the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and requir'd to find Caution to de|&s;i&s;t,
as being the known legal Execution upon &s;uch prohibitory Senten|ces,
or otherwi&s;e to go to Pri&s;on. But they &s;till refu&s;ing to obtemper,
the Magi&s;trates thought fit on the <HI>13th</HI> to &s;end Five only to Pri&s;on, which
Five were al&s;o at length reliev'd; &s;o indulgent were the Magi&s;trates in
this Matter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This whole Trial, and all the Steps thereof, being tran&s;mitted
to Her Maje&s;ty, it pleas'd Her Maje&s;ty by her Royal Letters under Hand
and Seal of the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, to approve what was done by the
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the &s;aid Matter, as acceptable Service; and
farder to judge it nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety of her Royal Per&s;on and Go|vernment,
that all &s;uch Meeting-Hou&s;es in every other Place &s;hould be
&s;hut up.&endq;</P>
<P>By this &s;hort Account of the Proceedings it will appear, whether the
Magi&s;trates acted by true, fair and legal Methods, or no; and the long
Objections about the Illegality of the Proce&s;s, and the Allowance of ten
Days in the Citation to an&s;wer, is effectually confuted.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
It may be noted here too, how unju&s;t all the Preten&s;ions of Illegality in
the Sentence are, as to ordaining them to forbear the Exerci&s;e of their
Mini&s;terial Function within the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> for the Act of Parlia|ment
enacting the Preachers not having Benefices to be puni&s;h'd by Bani&s;h|ment,
or otherwi&s;e as the Privy-Council &s;hall think fit&mdash;- And the Privy-Council
remitting their Authority to the Magi&s;trates, <HI>'tis hard,</HI> the Magi|&s;trates
&s;hould be complain'd of for a Sentence which was <HI>lighter,</HI> than the
Law had empower'd them to inflict.</P>
<P>And this brings us to the &s;econd Head in the Magi&s;trates Conduct, which,
we &s;ay, was in all the Parts of it MERCIFUL and CHARITABLE, to
the Extent of their Power; which appears in &s;everal Parts of their Pro&s;e|cution.</P>
<P>1. That upon the fir&s;t Libel, and the Sentence thereupon, notwith|&s;tanding
the Sentence pronounc'd, and which oblig'd the Mini&s;ters
to find Caution or <HI>Bail</HI> to de&s;i&s;t preaching or exerci&s;ing any Part of
their Mini&s;try within the Bounds of the City and Suburbs, yet the
Magi&s;trates in Compa&s;&s;ion to their Per&s;ons let them go free, without
in&s;i&s;ting upon the &s;aid Bail, or &s;ending for them again at the Time
appointed, except Mr. <HI>Graham,</HI> who was committed for a particu|lar
Affront to the Queen, when in Reading the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, he
purpo&s;ely pa&s;s'd over the Prayers appointed for Queen <HI>ANNE.</HI></P>
<P>2. That upon the fir&s;t Citation the Magi&s;trates di&s;tingui&s;h'd of Men
al&s;o, and &s;ome, who tho' not qualify'd, yet being known to be Men
of more peaceable Di&s;po&s;itions, unconcern'd with publick Affairs,
praying for the Queen, and living quietly, were not &s;ummon'd or
cited at all, nor their Meeting-Hou&s;es &s;hut up, &s;uch as Mr. . . <HI>Walker,</HI>
Mr: <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lum&s;dale;</HI> and that the Rea&s;ons and Fact may
be ju&s;tify'd together, we have it to produce under the Hands of the
&s;aid Magi&s;trates thus; That <HI>the&s;e three were not cited neither in</HI> March,
<HI>(which was the fir&s;t Time) nor afterwards, becau&s;e it was generally believ'd
they were good Men, and behav'd more peaceably than the re&s;t; nor have
they been troubled &s;ince, tho' they were not qualify'd.</HI></P>
<P>3. That whereas upon the &s;everal Defences made before the Magi|&s;trates,
one of the Mini&s;ters alledg'd, that he had a numerous Fa|mily,
and had no other way to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them; the Magi&s;trates being
oblig'd to put the Law in Execution as to his Preaching, immediate|ly
gave him a con&s;iderable Supply out of their own Pur&s;es for the
pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence of his Family.</P>
<P>4. That when, as by the &s;econd Sentence appears, Five of the Mini&s;ters
were committed to the Tol Booth of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for refu&s;ing to <HI>find
Caution, &amp;c.</HI> and one of the &s;aid Mini&s;ters was taken ill in the Pri&s;on;
On the fir&s;t Notice to the Magi&s;trates of his Illne&s;s, they &s;uffer'd him
to go home on his Parol, and &s;oon after let all the re&s;t be di&s;mi&s;s'd
without any farther Rigour, till they found them ob&s;tinate and in|&s;ulting.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="30">
The&s;e and &s;everal other In&s;tances of the Mercy of the Magi&s;trates
may be given, and &s;erve &s;ufficiently to clear them of acting any officious
forward Part, any farther than they were oblig'd to do as Magi&s;trates
in the Di&s;charge of their Duty, and for the Pre&s;ervation of the Pub|lick
Peace, according to Her Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Direction.</P>
<P>Nor even with the expre&s;s Direction of the Government, did the
Magi&s;trates appear forward, or act in it as Men fond of the Occa&s;ion,
but &s;hew'd them&s;elves very loth and backward to bring things to Extre|meties,
had they not been forc'd to it the &s;econd Time, by the Con|tempt
of their former Proceedings, in the Mini&s;ters entring their Meet|ings
by Force, and re&s;olving in a private Meeting of their own, that
they would not de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor even then did they proceed, till Her Maje&s;ty's Advocate by Ex|pre&s;s
Orders of the Government, the Privy-Council being then Di&s;&s;ol|ved,
gave them fre&s;h Notice, That it was Her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, that
all manner of Di&s;affection to the Government &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;s'd, and
the Encouragers thereof proceeded again&s;t according to Law, and In|&s;trumented
the Magi&s;trates thereupon.</P>
<P>Take this in the very Words of one of the Principal Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who&s;e Conduct the <HI>Narrative</HI> would fain blacken in this Affair,
which by the way &s;eems but a very mean Requital for the Tenderne&s;s
his Lord&s;hip &s;hewed for them.</P>
<P>&startq;The Proce&s;s tells plainly the Rea&s;on of the Pro&s;ecution, and that the
Magi&s;trates had &s;trict Ordersfrom the Council, for pro&s;ecuting all the
Mini&s;ters Preaching in Meeting-Hou&s;es, who did not quallify accor|ding
to Law, by taking the Oaths, and praying for the Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
as the Law directs; as Per&s;ons there by keeping up a Sett of Peo|ple,
who were Dangerous and Prejudicial to the Government,
both in Church and State, and not &s;afe to be &s;uffered&mdash;This <HI>Proce&s;s</HI>
Commenced in <HI>March,</HI> and the Council would have had them &s;ent
Pri&s;oners from the Bar; but the Magi&s;trates were tender of them,
and gave them above a Fortnight to find Surety&mdash;Nor at the End
of that Time were they call'd upon to perform it, we being willing
to make them ea&s;ie&mdash;- But in return to this Civility, they
were &s;o unkind, within about three Weeks, as to go to their
&s;everal Meeting-Hou&s;es, which the Magi&s;trates had cau&s;ed to be
padlock'd according to the Sentence, and to break them open
by force, in De&s;yance of the &s;aid Sentence, and the Authority of
the Magi&s;trates; and having done this, they preached publickly,
without any regard to us; upon which, the QUEEN's Advo|cate
INSTRUMENTED the Magi&s;trates, in order to oblige
us to &s;hut them up again; or that we &s;hould be an&s;werable
to the Government for the neglect of our Duty; the Privy-Council
in <HI>Scotland</HI> being then taken away.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">
&startq;As to the Mini&s;ters being cited, who were quallifyed or not qualli|&s;yed
fir&s;t, there were three or four of them never cited at all,
neither in <HI>March</HI> nor afterward, tho' they were not quallified, be|cau&s;e
it was generally believed they were good Men, and behaved
them&s;elves more peaceably than the rest; of the&s;e were Mr.
<HI>John&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lum&s;dale,</HI> but this <HI>Walker</HI> is not the
&s;ame with him mention'd in the Proce&s;s&mdash;Nor was there one
quallifyed Mini&s;ter among them, except Mr. <HI>Sutherland</HI>&mdash;Who
tho' quallifyed, made u&s;e of his being &s;o, to &s;et up other un|quallifyed
Mini&s;ters in his Pulpit, who not only did not pray
for the Queen, but as we were inform'd, u&s;ed publick Reflections
in the &s;aid Pulpit again&s;t the Government, both in Church
and State; yet he receiv'd no other Puni&s;hment, than a Charge
not to &s;uffer any unquallifyed Mini&s;ter to Preach in his Place.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adam Peacock</HI> pleaded, that he was quallified, but it appearing
&startq;to be done after the fir&s;t Citation, he having gone to my Lord
<HI>Cromarty,</HI> who had &s;uffer'd him to quallify after the Citation; we
reported the &s;ame to the Council, which they judged to be Ille|gal;
but farther, the Coucil would not admit of the Plea of
Mr. <HI>Peacock,</HI> becau&s;e he was Depo&s;ed by the Proce&s;s of the Church
for Scandal, which Sentence of Depo&s;ing was produc'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to citing tho&s;e only that made u&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service; There
was no Di&s;tinction made at all of tho&s;e who u&s;ed it, or tho&s;e
who did not; they were all cited in <HI>March</HI> 1708. whereof not a|bove
three or four of them at mo&s;t, us'd the <HI>Engli&s;h Service,</HI> as
we were inform'd.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Let any Impartial Con&s;idering Per&s;on upon reading this, tell us, whe|ther
the Magi&s;trates have acted any thing le&s;s or more than their Duty
to their Sovereign obliged them to; or whether they did not &s;hew all
the Tenderne&s;s to the &s;aid Mini&s;ters, which con&s;i&s;ted with their Duty;
how well the <HI>Narrative</HI> requites them for that Tenderne&s;s, is left to e|very
Impartial Judgement to determine.</P>
<P>4. The <HI>Fourth Enquiry,</HI> is relating to the Behaviour of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and whether it has not obliged the Government to do
this; but this being &s;poken to under the Head of Rea&s;ons, ju&s;tify|ing

of it to their &s;everal Behaviours, &s;ince their fir&s;t Citation, and
under the re&s;pective Proceedings of the Magi&s;trates, and the
Arg$ments u&s;ed by the <HI>Narrative,</HI> in Defence of their Meetings,
and upon which, they pretend to claim the Liberty they take,
may come under this Head to be con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32">
And fir&s;t their Behaviour under the Sentence&mdash;Which it &s;eems was
as above, to requite the Lenity of the Magi&s;trates, with a Contempt
of their Authority, and with a Breach of the Peace, as well as a
Violation of the Re&s;pect due for the Civility of not &s;ending them
to Pri&s;on, as the Magi&s;trates were de&s;ir'd to do.</P>
<P>This &s;hew'd not a Di&s;re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of the Magi&s;trates only,
as well as a Contempt of Authority, but &s;eem'd to be &s;omething Di&s;in|genuous
to that Courte&s;y, that had forborn committing them to the Toll-Booth
when they not only had it in their Power, but when the Govern|ment
expected it of them.</P>
<P>Next is to be ob&s;erv'd their Pleading to the Juri&s;diction of the Ma|gi&s;trates,
and con&s;equently pretending they were not comptetent Judges,
in which they were effectually an&s;wer'd, that the Act of Parliament re|ferring
the Sentencing them to the Privy-Council, and the Privy-Council
referring it again to the Magi&s;trates; they had by that means a Right of
Determining in this Matter; be&s;ides, that being Legal Magi&s;tates within
the Burgh of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the Time being, all the Inhabitants of the
&s;aid Burgh were con&s;equently within their Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>We come now to con&s;ider their &s;everal Dilators or Demurs to the Le|gality

<P>Brief and plain An&s;wers to the Matters of Law, and &s;ome other Obje|ctions,
made to the late Proceedings again&s;t the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters in
<HI>EDINBURGH.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;1. It is evident, that the fore&s;aid Tryal and Proceedings again&s;t
the di&s;affected Preachers in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> was only on the Account of
their notour and dangerous Di&s;affection, in not praying for Her Ma|je&s;ty,
and not &s;wearing Allegiance to Her as the Law requires; for
tho' the Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> would have it believ'd, that they were
proceeded again&s;t on the Act of Parliament, 1695. as Intruders, and for
exerci$ing any Part of their Mini&s;terial Function within <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> yet
<PB N="24" REF="33">
the contrary is manife&s;t from the Libel exhibited again&s;t them, which
proceeds only from the Points abovementioned, and to which there
was no &s;atisfying An&s;wer made. I'ts true, &s;ome of them pretended
they had prayed for the Queen, but when demanded if they had taken
the Oath of Allegiance, they as plainly refu&s;ed it; and albeit it was
urged, with what &s;incerity they could be under&s;tood to pray for Her
Maje&s;ty, &s;ince they refu&s;ed to &s;wear Allegiance to Her, and that in effect
praying for Her, was the only proper Allegiance that could be requi|red
of Mini&s;ters; They an&s;wer'd nothing; it being very certain, that
even &s;uch as pray for Her Maje&s;ty, do it in &s;uch ambig$ous Terms,
and with &s;uch an Exten&s;ion to all the Royal Family, as plainly includes
the Pretender, and &s;till tends to uphold the Faction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, <HI>Sec$ndly,</HI> Other of them were &s;o bold, and yet they were all of a
Piece; as when que&s;tioned, how they could omit to pray for her Maje&s;ty,
&s;ince they profe&s;s'd to u&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h Service,</HI> To an&s;wer plainly,
that they pa&s;s'd and overleap'd that Part of the Service, than which no|thing
could be more Undutiful.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But this <HI>Narrative</HI> would have the World believe, That the only
Rea&s;on why the&s;e Men are pro&s;ecuted, is, becau&s;e they are for <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI>
and the Wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and where this in&s;inuation
points is ea&s;ie to be di&s;cern'd; but waving the general Notion of <HI>E|pi&s;copacy,</HI>
as al&s;o what regards the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy,</HI> as not of our pre|&s;ent
Concern; it may certainly be truly &s;aid, That <HI>Scots Prelacy,</HI> con&s;i|dering
its u&s;e fir&s;t and la&s;t, with its unaccountable Practices and &s;ad
Effects, for which it hath been in a little more than an Age twice thrown
out and aboli&s;h'd; mu&s;t be even odious to all good Men, and that affe|cted
Innovations being always very di&s;tracting, Novelties of this kind
in Matters of Religion prove ever more hurtful than edifying.&endq;</P>
<P>The <HI>Narrative</HI> rips up many things which are already fully an&s;wer'd, and
which it had been far more advi&s;able for the Author to have conceal'd. As
where he &s;ays, That the late <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> have been very hardly
us'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> as fir&s;t, a great Part of them in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>South</HI>
rabled out of their Churches, and then the re&s;t en&s;nared as it were
with new Laws, and thereby thrown out: But as to the Rabbling,
any Man reflect on the fir&s;t Entry of the&s;e Gentlemen, with that Deluge
of Prophanity that attended it; and how they tyranniz'd over
poor Peoples Con&s;ciences, (for quiet Submi&s;&s;ion was then no
Man's &s;afty) with uuheard of Violences and Indignities, and not
conclude that they were the cau&s;e of all the Mi&s;chief that en&s;ued;
and can any Man con&s;ider, how the <HI>We&s;t</HI> and a great part of the
<HI>South</HI> were truly reduced to that Condition, that &s;carce a Family was
to be found, that had not either a Father, Son, Brother, or near Re|lation
hang'd, murther'd, tortur'd, bani&s;h'd, or grievou&s;ly impri|&s;on'd;
be&s;ides the heavy and unaccountable Calamities of the Highland
Ho&s;t; and not rather wonder that the Change happen'd &s;o ea&s;ily at
the late Happy Revolution; it being a thing known, that the mo&s;t part
<PB N="25" REF="34">
of the&s;e Men, then call'd <HI>Curates,</HI> were &s;uffer'd to flee away in the fer|ror
they were con&s;cious of, without any other Prejudice; and that
the few that &s;taid behind were only remov'd without the lea&s;t
hurt, either to their Per&s;ons or Goods; a Moderation indeed mo&s;t re|markable
in the&s;e poor Men, who dealt &s;o well with their Adver&s;a|ries,
when thus deliver'd into their hand, for as was &s;aid of old; <HI>If a
Man find his Enemy, will he let him go well away?</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But this Author &s;ays, &s;ince the&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters</HI> were rabbl'd out
by Violence; why were they not again reponed in Ju&s;tice by the Go|vernment?
and to deal plainly, it is very certain, that tho' the Go|vernment
had then reponed them in the ample&s;t manner; yet they
dur&s;t not have adventur'd back, nor could they have been re&s;tor'd with|out
downright Force; a Service which, all things con&s;ider'd, no wi&s;e
Government could judge worthy of the Co&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for the Acts of Convention and Parliament, whereof the <HI>Narrative</HI>
complains, as purpo&s;ely made to en&s;nare and throw out; the Inju&s;tice of
this Charge may ea&s;ily appear from con&s;idering, That the Act of Con|vention
was fairly and hone&s;tly made; That all Mini&s;ters and Preachers
&s;hou'd pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> upon whom the Crown
was then &s;ettl'd; which was wholly agreeable to the Direction of the
Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Duty of all good Subjects; and without all doubt
was not only intended for them, but for all their Royal Suc|ce&s;&s;ors.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But
here the <HI>Narrative</HI> pleads a hard&s;hip put on the Clergy, becau&s;e
of the &s;hort warning they had to transfer in that manner their Alle|giance,
when they lay under former Engagements, and had been for a
long time habitual to the ob&s;ervance thereof; and as to this Point the
<HI>Narrative</HI> declares plainly enough, how much they did judge, and &s;till do
judge them&s;elves under former Engagements to the late King <HI>James,</HI> and the
Pretender now in his Place. But &s;eeing the&s;e very Men were Witne&s;&s;es to
all the Cau&s;es that preceded the Claim of Right, and could not but
al&s;o &s;ee the extraordinary hand of God, that <HI>per volentes Populos,</HI> brought
about &s;o wonderfully the happy Revolution; and how the &s;ame was
carried on by the con&s;ent of all good Men, and &s;ettled by the Authori|ty
of both Kingdoms, and the good Effects that &s;ince have en&s;ued, for
them to pretend either Con&s;cience or Surprize to dem$rr their comply|ance,
is too manife&s;t <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> to de&s;erve any An&s;wer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Secondly,</HI> The next Act of Parliament they complain of is, the Sixth
Act of the Parliament, 1693. Whereby all Mini&s;ters and Preachers are
Ordained to take the Allegiance with the A&s;&s;urance, under the Pains if
Benefic'd, of being deprived, and if not Benefic'd, to be puni&s;h'd by
Bani&s;hment, or otherwi&s;e at the Plea&s;ure of the Privy-Council. That
this Act doth concern all Preachers, and that the &s;ame is rather con|firmed
than weaken'd by the Act, Recognizing Her Maje&s;ty, and doth
bind not only to King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> hath been already
fully clear'd.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="35">
&startq;But here the <HI>Narrative</HI> fir&s;t In&s;inuates, That in Matters of Con&s;cience
and Religious Oaths, it belongs rather to the Clergy to direct, than
to be directed; and that the Certification could never throw them out
of their Mini&s;try, which they receiv'd not from Man, but from their
Lord and Ma&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To which 'tis an&s;wer'd, That if the Government cannot devi&s;e and
impo&s;e &s;o plain an Oath, as the Oath of Allegiance appears to be, for
its own nece&s;&s;ary Security, it can do nothing; and the A&s;&s;arance is no
more than the ju&s;t Explication thereof. But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The&s;e Gentle|men
&s;hould con&s;ider, That this Oath of Allegiance is only requir'd of
them as Preachers, and to prevent them in that Capacity, from either
Poi&s;oning Her Maje&s;ty good Subjects, or fomenting Faction to Her
Prejudice, and impo&s;es no farder either upon their Opinion or Con|&s;cience.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It
was indeed a part of the Rigour of the late Times, that Men
were told they mu&s;t either comply with the King's Plea&s;ure, or they
were unworthy to breath the King's Air; but now it is the benign
Goodne&s;s of Her Maje&s;ty, that <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> may both enjoy their Opi|nion
and their Con&s;cience, and freely breath GOD's Air, provi|ding
they di&s;turb not the Publick Peace, wherein their own Peace is
included; &s;o that the Que&s;tion now is, not whether Men &s;hall renounce
either their Opinions or their Con&s;ciences, but preci&s;ely, If Men can be
tolerate to Preach in Publick Meetings, who notoriou&s;ly declare their
Di&s;affection to Her Maje&s;ty and her Government, by refu&s;ing to pray for
her and promi&s;e her Allegiance, as the Law requires: A Point &s;o clear,
that it may well be affirmed, there is not a State or Kingdom in the
Earth that would allow &s;uch a Sett of Men to follow &s;uch an Employ|ment
on &s;uch Conditions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays, there are many <HI>Presbyterian Preachers</HI> over|look'd
in this Matter, and not put to take the Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But is it
not as well known, That the&s;e <HI>Presbyterian Mini&s;ters</HI> did at fir&s;t &s;hew &s;uch
a Readine&s;s in this Matter, and do all along, both in their Doctrine,
Wor&s;hip, and Conver&s;ation, declare &s;o plainly and clearly their Alle|giance
and Fidelity to her Maje&s;ty and her Government, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to fix on them the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and as &s;uperfluous to require
of them any Purgation.&endq;</P>
<P>But the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays, That the&s;e <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Preachers</HI> are all very
&startq;good Subjects, profe&s;&s;ing entire Subjection, and di&s;owning all Se|ditions
and Rebellious Principles, and Men truly loving and ob&s;erving
Peace; and here we have the in&s;inuation of their old Cant, for ab&s;o|$$te
Subjection, and for Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience, and again&s;t all defen&s;ive
Arms; the Vanity whereof is &s;ufficiently every where di&s;cover'd. But,
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> may it not be heartily wi&s;h'd, that the&s;e &s;o very Peaceable and
Pa&s;&s;ive Men may never meet with &s;uch Provocations, as others have
had, even from their Hands. And next how can we believe them to be
&s;o Peaceable, who refu&s;e to pray for, and promi&s;e Allegiance to Her
<PB N="27" REF="36">
Maje&s;ty; when GOD hath commanded the &s;ame to all Subjects for
this very End, that we may lead a Peaceable Life under them; as
likewi&s;e what Opinion can we have, either of their Peaceablene&s;s or Loyal
Subjection, who not only forbear to keep Fa&s;ts for Succe&s;s and Thank&s;|givings,
for Victories again&s;t Her Maje&s;ty and our Declared Enemies
but openly neglect, de&s;pi&s;e and flout at the &s;ame?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays, That yet they are good Men, and cannot be
charged with any Immorality in their Lives, or Error in their Do|ctrine,
or Exception again&s;t their Wor&s;hip. And again, that their
Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, and Practice cannot be Taxed: For their Im|moralities,
it were indeed heartily to be wi&s;h'd, that both they and
we, were clearer from that Charge; but next, how can they excu&s;e
their Practice, or purge them&s;elves of Immorality, who are &s;o notourly
di&s;affected towards their Soveraigns Government, and the Peace al&s;o of her
Kingdoms. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Doth not their denying of Error in their Do|ctrine,
or any thing cen&s;urable in their Wor&s;hip &s;ufficiently acknow|ledge,
that their Doctrine and Wor&s;hip is upon the Matter, the &s;ame
with the Doctrine and Wor&s;hip of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> as they indeed
are: But then, why do they &s;eparate, and &s;o tenaciou&s;ly foment and
maintain Schi&s;m; or where is the Point of Con&s;cience that can be
pleaded for this Divi&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But this <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays, Neither they nor their Hearers can allow
of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination;</HI> not can they endure that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI>
&s;hould bani&s;h the Apo&s;tles Creed, the Doxology, the Ten Command|ments,
and the Lords Prayer from the Wor&s;hip of GOD. As to
the Point of Ordination, they of late in&s;i&s;t much on this Topick, to
impo&s;e on the Simple, as if <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had no Lawful Ordination, and
con&s;equently no Lawful Ordinances: But this Que&s;tion having been
&s;o fully and often debated, it may be &s;ufficient here to affirm, That
the Call of GOD, with our Lord's Mi&s;&s;ion, in the Way and Order
agreeable to Scripture, is undoubtedly the be&s;t Title and Authority to
qualify a true Mini&s;ter, and all his Admini&s;trations: This was the
only Title and Authority that the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves had; and it was
by the &s;ame Call and Mi&s;&s;ion, that the fir&s;t Propagators of the Go&s;pel,
after their being &s;catter'd from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> went every where preaching
the Word, travelling even as far as <HI>Phenice, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI>
without the lea&s;t mention of &s;o much as an Apo&s;tolick Licen&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But if the&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copal Brethren</HI> will &s;till contend for an Ordination
with a Pedigree derived from Noble Ance&s;tors&punc; We are far from en|vying
them that Church Heraldry, &s;ince it mu&s;t &s;till be attended with
many horrible Blots as well as Blanks in their E&s;cutcheon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But where the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ays, that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> do bani&s;h the
Ten Commandments, the Lords Prayer, the Apo&s;tles Creed, and the
Doxology from their Wor&s;hip. What Accu&s;ation can be more unju&s;t,
&s;eeing as to the Ten Commandments and the whole Law of GOD,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
they profe&s;s them to be their continual Mediation, the Delight of their
Heart, a Lamp unto their Feet a Light unto their Path, the
great Subject of their Doctrine, and the Rule of their Lives. And
as to Lord's Prayer, they firmy believe, and mo&s;t heartily embrace
it, as the mo&s;t perfect Pattern of Prayer, which our Lord him&s;elf did
only give without the help of any <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Liturgy, as &s;ome of the&s;e very
Men do groundle&s;sly affirm; for the Apo&s;tles Creed <HI>as they call it,</HI> it is in|deed
of a lower Origin; <HI>and known to be</HI> no Compo&s;ure of the Apo&s;tles,
tho' it contains indeed their Faith and Doctrine, nor yet was it &s;o much as
heard of in the Church for the fir&s;t three Centuries; after which this <HI>For|mula,</HI>
indeed appear'd, but not without notable Variations, which remain
even to this Day; but &s;ince the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have in their Confe&s;&s;ion of
Faith, &s;o diligently and exactly explain'd and extended it; and &s;o fully
confirm'd it; and thus do &s;o con&s;tantly u&s;e it? With what Truth can
they be &s;aid to have bani&s;h'd it from their Wor&s;hip. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the
Doxology, a Man might doubt if the Objector did under&s;tand the true
meaning of the Word, &s;ince almo&s;t all our Prayers, both in Publick
and Private are therewith <HI>in terminis,</HI> concluded.&endq;</P>

To pray for the King and Queen then Reigning, as King and

Ninety Three Years; and &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent Acts of the &s;ame Nature,

did countenance to keep up Meeting-Hou&s;es, where their Preachers
prayed not for Her Maje&s;ty QUEEN <HI>ANNE,</HI> as they &s;hould

not only countenanced a Party and Faction Di&s;affected to Her Maje&s;ty's
Royal Government; but more when an Inva&s;ion was threaten'd from
the Enemies, was a great Encouragement to the&s;e Enemies, and a great
weakning to the hands of all Her Male&s;ty's good Subjects, had therefore

<P>&startq;THAT where they were Indicted as Criminals, before their
Honours, and accu&s;ed as Per&s;ons manife&s;tly di&s;affected to her Ma|je&s;ty's
Government, and guilty of the Breaches of &s;undry Acts of Par|liament,
particularly of the Sixteenth Act of the Convention of E&s;tates.
<HI>Anno</HI> One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Eighty Nine Years; Requiring
all Mini&s;ters publickly to pray for the King and Queen then Reigning,
and of the Sixth Act of the Parliament, holden in <HI>Anno</HI> One Thou&s;and
Six Hundred and Ninety Three Years: Requiring all <HI>Preachers</HI> and <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters</HI>
of the Go&s;pel to take the Oath of Allegiance, and to &s;ub&s;cribe
the &s;ame with the A&s;&s;urance in the Terms, and under the Certifi|cations
mention'd in the &s;aid Acts; And furder it was Libell'd again&s;t
them; That they out of a Factious Principle again&s;t Her Maje&s;ty's
Government, and the Peace and Security of the Kingdom were re|gardle&s;s
and negligent in ob&s;ervance of Publick Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;gi|vings:
Which Accu&s;ations (being as the Libel alledg'd) Notour and
Proving them&s;elves: Therefore it was concluded, that we having in|curr'd
the Pains of the Law, ought to be decerned to de&s;i&s;t from
Preaching, or keeping of Meeting-Hou&s;es within the Bounds of the
good Town and to find Caution for that Effect, or otherwi&s;e be Im|pri&s;on'd
until due Obedience were given. <HI>For An&s;wer</HI> to the Libel;
they did take leave in the fir&s;t Place, to urge &s;ome Rea&s;ons, as well a|gain&s;t
the Formality of the Procedure, as again&s;t the Competency and
Relevancy of the Libel; and in the next Place &s;hould offer &s;uch An|&s;wers,
as were founded upon the Rules and Principles, both of Cha|rity
and Chri&s;tianity. The Informality of Procedure as they humbly
conceiv'd, was evident from the Seventy Second Act of the Sixth Par|liament
of King <HI>James</HI> V. Whereby it was Statute and Ordain'd, That
all Citations upon the Precepts of inferior Judges, &s;hall be upon Fif|ten
Days, which tho' it might have been &s;aid to be in De&s;uetude, as
to Citations within Burgh, in Relation to Civil Ca&s;es or Petry Delin|quences;
yet it &s;hould have been duly ob&s;erv'd in the Citatious given,
upon Libels, Criminal, of which &s;ort the pre&s;ent was; that &s;o Defen|ders
might not for want of Time be over-reach'd, but have a full
allowance thereof, to propone and defend again&s;t &s;uch high Accu&s;a|tions
<HI>$word$</HI> Tho' by the Twenty Second Act of King <HI>William</HI>'s
Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Ninety Five Years,
Sheri$ffs, Stua$$s and their Deputies, and the Magi&s;trates of Burghs-Royal,
were Authoriz'd and requir'd to put in Execution the &s;aid Law,
<PB N="34" REF="43">
whereby the intruding into vacant Churches, and exerci&s;ing any Parts
of the Mini&s;terial Function within any Pari&s;h, without an orderly Call
and Legal Admi&s;&s;ion was di&s;charged. Yet the Execution &s;hould have
been in &s;uch a method, as the &s;aid Act pre&s;crib'd, <HI>viz.</HI> upon a Complaint
from the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> within who&s;e Bounds the &s;aid Illegal Exerci&s;e was,
or any Per&s;on having their Warrant, and upon Citation of Ten Days;
and therefore in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, there being no Complaint from the
<HI>Presbytery,</HI> or any having their Warrant, and the Citation not being
above Tea Days, but upon a far &s;horter time, the Procedure appear'd
Unwarrantable. In the like manner it was with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, contended,
That the Magi&s;trates of the <HI>good Town</HI> were not Judges competent of
the Libel, becau&s;e it was chiefly founded upon the Sixth Act of King
<HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> One Thou&s;and Six Hun|dred
and Ninety Three Years, requiring all Mini&s;ters and Preachers
of the Go&s;pel, to take the Oath of Allegiance, and &s;ub&s;cribe the A&s;|&s;urance;
Whereas, by the &s;aid Act it was provided, that the Con|traveener
&s;hould be puni&s;h'd by Bani&s;hment, or otherwi&s;e as the Coun|cil
(<HI>meaning the Privy Council</HI>) &s;hould think fit. And therefore the Libel
was improperly tabl'd there; &s;ince Magi&s;trates of Royal Burghs could
not competently Judge therein. Adhering to their fore&s;aid Dilator, and
Defences clearly founded upon the expre&s;s Acts of Parliaments above
cited, and which they craved <HI>ante omnia</HI> to be Di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. They did
proceed with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to call in que&s;tion, and impugn the Rele|vancy
of the Libel, which tho' inforc'd with the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tan|ces
of the Country, as threaten'd with an Inva&s;ion; yet it was con|tended,
that the Qualifications and Acts &s;ub&s;umed upon, were no ways
Relevant for inferring the Conclu&s;ion Libell'd. As to which, the fir&s;t
in order was the Sixteenth Act of the meeting of the E&s;tates, Or|daining
all Mini&s;ters within this Kingdom to pray for King <HI>William</HI>
and Queer <HI>Mary,</HI> as King and Queen of this Realm; of which Act
they are Libell'd as Contraveeners, becau&s;e they did not as was al|ledg'd
pray for Her Maje&s;ty QUEEN <HI>ANNE.</HI> It was an&s;wered
(1.) That the Per&s;ons, for whom Publick Prayers were ordered to be
made by the &s;aid Act were Dead, and the Act &s;hould dye with them
in Con&s;equence. (2.) That it was Invidious for the Pur&s;uer to bring
their Prayers into the Accu&s;ation, &s;eeing he could not alledge again&s;t
them any Words or Expre&s;&s;ions, that betrayed Contempt of Authori|ty,
or Di&s;re&s;pect to their Per&s;ons. They prayed for the whole <HI>Royal
Family.</HI> And that they were none of tho&s;e who de&s;pis'd Dominions, or
&s;peak'd Evil of Dignities, and therefore could not conceive upon what
Ground that Part of the Accu&s;ation was founded again&s;t them; e&s;pe|cially
&s;eeing there was no Form of Prayer, in relation to the Particular
impos'd by any Law, and that where there was no Law, there could
be no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. As to the Act of Parliament, One Thou&s;and Six
Hundred and Ninety Three Years, Ordaining all Mini&s;ters and Preach|ers
<PB N="35" REF="44">
of the Go&s;pel to take the Allegiance, and &s;ub&s;cribe the A&s;&s;urance.
It was an&s;wer'd, <HI>First.</HI> That it would appear to Men, &s;uch only as
were &s;ettled in Charges, and injoyed Benefices, and that they were the
more warranted to &s;ay &s;o by the Act of Recognition, that injoyned
the taking of them to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> obliged only them that were in
Publick Tru&s;t, Civil, Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, or Military, which reached not the
Ca&s;e of the Defenders, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had any
Tru&s;t, when they had not &s;o much a Legal Toleration: And whatever
could have been the Sence of the Act, One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and
Ninety Three Years, It was out of Doors, being limited to the Per|&s;ons
of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and even of tho&s;e that were
in Tru&s;t by po&s;e&s;&s;ion of Benefices. It was known there were &s;everal
that had never quallifyed them&s;elves in the Terms of the Law. The
Government being &s;o far indulgent, as to have &s;uper&s;eded the Execu|tion
of a Law in &s;ome Ca&s;es, rather than to have impo&s;ed upon the weak
and tender Con&s;ciences of any; particularly of tho&s;e of the Mini&s;te|rial
Function. And therefore it was not to be imagin'd, that the Ma|gi&s;trates
of the City (in behalf whereof they were not wanting in their
Prayers to Heaven) would give their countenance to the Libel, that
proceeded upon the &s;tretching of Laws beyond their true meaning a|gain&s;t
them, who injoyed no Benefice under the Government. And
tho' they could not alledge any Law for the&s;e Meetings; yet they
had good Rea&s;on to plead, that there was no Law again&s;t them, for
the&s;e Laws that were urged again&s;t Meeting-Hou&s;es could never be
interpreted to their Prejudice, but by &s;tretching them beyond their
intent. For the Act 22 <HI>Anno</HI> One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Ninety
Five Years, frequently made u&s;e of again&s;t them; Entitl'd, <HI>An Act a|ga$$&s;t
intruding into Churches and Benefices,</HI> They humbly conceiv'd the
Meaning and De&s;ign thereof only, to be the Di&s;po&s;e&s;&s;ing of <HI>Epi&s;copal
Mini&s;ters</HI> of their Churches and Man&s;es; That the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> might
have had free Acce&s;s to them. So as nothing could, according to the
Letter of the Law, be con&s;trued an intru&s;ion on the Part of the <HI>Epi&s;|copal
Mini&s;ter,</HI> but the entring into the&s;e Churches (which were once
declared Vacant) without a Legal Call. But that it was far from the
Thoughts of the Government or Parliament under that Head; to com|prehend
the Exerci&s;es of the Mini&s;try, by People of <HI>Epi&s;copal Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI>
in any other Place, and thereby to exclude the Mini&s;ters and People of
that Judgment from the Benefit of Ordinances, and opportunity of Sa|craments;
and this was the more plain way that never any Law could
be procur'd, for obliging the People under the Penalties to re&s;ort to
the <HI>Presbyterian Preachers,</HI> and to receive the Sacraments from them,
which was Natural for them to demand. And it was further evident,
That the De&s;ign and Intent of the&s;e Acts was never levell'd again&s;t
the&s;e Private Meetings in little Hou&s;es, becau&s;e the Queen in her mo&s;t
Gracious Letter in <HI>February,</HI> the Fourth Day, One Thou&s;and Seven
Hundred and Three Years, con&s;ider'd Meeting-Hou&s;es, as having a Ta|cit
<PB N="36" REF="45">
Allowance, ordering them to be protected, whil&s;t they lived De|cently
and Regularly as good Chri&s;tians and Subjects. And in &s;o do|ing,
that they &s;hould be protected in the Peaceable Exerci&s;e of their
Religion, and in their Per&s;ons and E&s;tates, according to the Laws
of the Kingdom. In the Po&s;e&s;&s;ion of which Favour they had
continued hitherto, by Vertue of the Authority fore&s;aid, and was
homologated by the Parliaments that had &s;itten ever &s;ince, who never
had quarrel'd the&s;e Meetings, nor had made any Laws again&s;t them.
And they were confident that they had done nothing, either in the &s;aids
Meetings, or any other where, that might have deprived them of their
Liberty. And therefore did claim the continuance of the &s;aid Favour,
and that all Proce&s;s again&s;t them might cea&s;e, $ill Her Maje&s;ty's farther
Plea&s;ure, thereanent were &s;ignifyed; it having been u&s;ual for Royal Fa|vours
once granted not to be Re-call'd, unle&s;s the Conditions &s;tipula|ted
had been by the People violated and broken, which could not here
be ju&s;tly alledg'd. And as to the neglecting of Publick Fa&s;ts and
Thank&s;givings, which was the third and la&s;t quallification of the Libel.
It was an&s;wer'd, That they were not u&s;ually directed to them, or other
Preachers in Meeting-Hou&s;es. And particularly the la&s;t Proclamation
for a Fa&s;t, was only directed to Mini&s;ters in Churches, who could only
be challeng'd for neglect thereof, if any &s;uch there were. And there|fore
their not ob&s;erving them publickly in their Meeting Hou&s;es, could
not be con&s;tructed a Crime, or Fault; yea, in &s;uch Ca&s;es they were at a
&s;tand how to carry, le&s;t the calling together their Hearers on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions,
might been thought pre&s;umptuous, and given offence, even to
&s;ome in the Government. Having thus an&s;wer'd their Libel in Point of
Law; they conclude their Defence with a Word or two from the Prin|ciples
of Chri&s;tianity and Charity. As to which they begg'd leave to
&s;ay, that it was not altogether agreeable to the Rules of Chri&s;tianity, for
their Accu&s;er, to endeavour the &s;hutting up of their Mouths and
Meeting-Hou&s;es, &s;ince they thereby de&s;ign'd nothing &s;o much as the
Glory of GOD, and the Advantage of the Souls of tho&s;e who were
plea&s;ed to hear them. And albeit, it might by the Providence of God,
prove a comfortable Mean, for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting of their Families; they could
not think that their Accu&s;ers, or any other, were &s;o invidious, as to
grudge them the &s;ame, or &s;o cruel as to be offended thereat, and by the
Proce&s;s to deprive them of the &s;ame. And that the Libel appear'd no le&s;s
di&s;agreeable to the Government, charging them as factious and Encou|ragers
of Wicked De&s;igns again&s;t the Country, which uncharitable
Thought they pre&s;um'd to &s;ay, could had no Ri&s;e from their Practices,
Lives, or Doctrines, &s;ince they in their private and &s;everal Stations had
kep'd their &s;elves Di&s;intere&s;ted from all Publick Affairs and Matters of Go|vernment,
and could give the Defiance to their greate&s;t Enemies, to give
the lea&s;t In&s;tance of any Di&s;order or Di&s;turbance, occa&s;ion'd either
from their &s;elves or Meeting-Hou&s;es. And therefore the&s;e high Crimes
where with they were charged in the Libel appear'd both groundle&s;s and
invidious.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IT cannot but be obvious now to any con&s;idering Reader, that has
given him&s;elf the trouble to peru&s;e the&s;e Sheets; That the Cry of
Per&s;ectuion which has made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the World, has &s;ome other
Foundation than the true Matter of Fact will bear.</P>
<P>The naked Truth appears in few Words. Thus, there are in the City
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a great number of profe&s;s'd Enemies, to the Government,
to the Succe&s;&s;ion, to the Settlement of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the
Union, who openly avow them&s;elves <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and are not a&s;ham'd of
it. The&s;e by the Lenity of the Government, had their open A&s;&s;embly,
and Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters to preach to them, but all <HI>Non-Jurors;</HI> they
neither prayed for the QUEEN, or &s;wore Allegiance to the QUEEN;
nay, &s;ome were come to that height, as expre&s;sly to pray for the Pre|tender&mdash;That
is for THE KING, as they call'd him; yet the Go|vernment
forbore them, till the Alarm was given of a Powerful Inva|&s;ion
in favour of the Pretender: Then in order to di&s;courage the Friends
of that Party, The&s;e Meetings were ordered to be &s;uppre&s;s'd as is related.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more rea&s;onable, than to have it be &s;o, even our
Enemies them&s;elves being Judges.</P>
<P>'Tis a plain and clear Truth, that not a Man in <HI>Scotland</HI> has been &s;i|lencd,
or a Meeting-Hou&s;e &s;hut up, but on this very Account; nay &s;uch
has been the Lenity of the late Lord Provo&s;t, Sir <HI>Samuel Mac-Clellan</HI> to
this very Party, for which they very ill requite him, That he &s;how'd
them Favours and Civilities they could not expect.</P>
<P>As <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Three of the&s;e very Di&s;&s;enters he never cited at all, nor &s;hut
up their Hou&s;es; nor has the pre&s;ent Lord Provo&s;t and Magi&s;trates di&s;|continued
that Favour, but tho&s;e three are now openly preaching in <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI>
and this purely with re&s;pect to the Characters of the Mini&s;ters,
being e&s;teemed Peaceable good Men; the&s;e are by Name, Mr.&mdash;<HI>John&s;ton,</HI>
Mr.&mdash;<HI>Lum&s;dal,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Walker.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> was order'd to be &s;ent to Pri&s;on for Con|tempt,
in pa&s;&s;ing the Prayer for the Queen in the <HI>Engli&s;h Service,</HI> he &s;lipt
out and went away, and the Provo&s;t never cau&s;ed him to be apprehended
again; which his Lord&s;hip might ea&s;ily have done.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Of the Five Mini&s;ters &s;entenc'd to Pri&s;on, only three were
confin'd, tho on a plain Contempt of the Magi&s;trates; and even tho&s;e
the Lord Provo&s;t in his mere Compa&s;&s;ion to them let go again, without
either Signing or finding Caution, as they were Sentenc'd.</P>
<P>So that in&s;tead of a Per&s;ecution of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> here is nothing but &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
profe&s;t <HI>Jacobite Conventicles,</HI> the &s;ame thing that is done by the
Church of <HI>England</HI> all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49">
In doing which in&s;tead of the Magi&s;trates u&s;ing them hardly and &s;training
the Law upon them, as the <HI>Narrative</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts; the then Lord Pro|vo&s;t
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Sir <HI>Samuel Mac-Clellan,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Magi|&s;trates
u&s;ed them with all the Gentlene&s;s, Tenderne&s;s, and Compa&s;&s;ion
po&s;&s;ible, or that could con&s;i&s;t with their Duty.</P>
<P>And as all this is Litterally and Undeniably true, it renders them in|excu&s;ably
to blame, both to &s;pread abroad &s;uch Complaints of Per&s;ecu|tion
in general, as if Epi&s;copacy was Per&s;ecuted as &s;uch, and very un|grateful
to the Lenity and Courte&s;y of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But more inexcu&s;able &s;till are they, who with De&s;ign to &s;pread Divi|&s;ions,
and encrea&s;e Animo&s;ities between the Nations, have indu&s;triou&s;ly
fill'd the Heads of the People in <HI>England</HI> with formal Stories, of the Cru|elty
of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> to the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scoland;</HI> and tho' it
may grate very hard upon his Reputation, we cannot but wonder how one
Mr. <HI>Cameron,</HI> a known Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter in <HI>Scoland,</HI> could &s;atisfy his Con|&s;cience,
when at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> not many Months &s;ince, he publickly villify'd
the Government of <HI>Britain,</HI> with Per&s;ecuting Epi&s;copacy, at the &s;ame
time knowing perfectly well, the Truth of what is here &s;et down, that
none reciv'd any Mole&s;tation, but &s;uch as openly rejected the QUEEN
and her Government.</P>
<P>Nor was that Gentleman plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, even common Decency
in his Reflections upon his own Country, and upon the Magi&s;trates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> whom he was ples'd to give too cour&s;e Language too, to have
it repeated here; but there is no wonder to be made, that Good Manners
&s;hould be wanting, where Truth was always wanting; and when Men
abandon their Con&s;ciences, they frequently let their Honour decay at
the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this Tract with this &s;hort Ob&s;ervation; It &s;eems the
la&s;t re&s;ort of the Enemies to the late Happy Union of this I&s;land, That
they apply them&s;elves as diligently as po&s;&s;ible, to keep up and Form
<HI>De novo,</HI> Publick National Aver&s;ions between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI>
&mdash;They know the Ble&s;&s;ings and Advantages that attend the Union,
are only to be found in Union; they know, if the Temper, Genius,
and Affections of the People Unite, as their Politick Capacities are U|nited,
they will grow formidable and invulnerable, and therefore with
$ too &s;ucce&s;sful Policy, they &s;trive to keep the People as much
as po&s;&s;ible divided, and this they find but too ea&s;ie to do, e&s;pecially by
the Arti&s;ice of this Party; they know nothing can exa&s;perate the Church
of <HI>England</HI> &s;o much, as to hear that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> Per&s;ecute People, on|ly
for their Affinity to their Church, and therefore they glo&s;s their Ac|counts
with that &s;pecious out &s;ide, tho' nothing in Nature is more ab&s;urd,
or in Fact more untrue.</P>
<P>We heartily wi&s;h the Two Nations <HI>now become one,</HI> would apply
them&s;elves to Unite in Intere&s;ts and A&s;&s;ections, and mark tho&s;e that &s;ow,
Divi&s;ions among them on either &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="50">
If National Aver&s;ions and National Prejudices are not laid a&s;leep on
both &s;ides, the Effects of the Union can never be an&s;werable to our hopes
on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>How &s;hall it be expected, That <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants &s;hould embark their
Stocks in Fi&s;hery, or plant their Families in <HI>Scotland?</HI> How &s;hould they
undertake Manufactures or Improvements, in order to employ the Peo|ple
and cultivate the Lands, while in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are repre&s;ented as a
People, de&s;igning to invade their Church, fill'd with implacable Aver|&s;ions
to their Di&s;cipline, and unea&s;y under the Security of the Church
obtain'd by the Treaty, while they are Repre&s;ented there as coming a|mong
them to &s;upplant and &s;ubject them.</P>
<P>Again, how &s;hall the <HI>Scots</HI> joyn heartily in your Defence, fight for you
by Land and Sea, and with their brave Spirits and able Bodies face your
Enemies? How &s;hall they chearfully pay your Taxes and Cu&s;toms, and
go hand in hand with you in all your new Models, while you look upon
them as Enemies to your Church, and Dangerous to your Settlement;
while you a&s;per&s;e and reproach them; and every Day &s;uffer their Nati|on
to be in&s;ulted, their Judicatories to be affronted, their Magi&s;tracy
&s;lander'd, and in&s;olent un&s;ufferable Abu&s;es offer'd them in Print, with|out
Redre&s;s or without Reproof?</P>
<P>The&s;e are not the &s;teps wi&s;e Men would take to Unite us; the encrea&s;e
of the&s;e Divi&s;ions, is the true way to de&s;troy the Peace on both &s;ides, and
to defeat every hone&s;t Man of his ju&s;t hopes from the Union.</P>
<P>'Tis for this End the&s;e fal&s;e Reports are rais'd, and Reproaches daily
given out; 'tis for this End that fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions are rais'd and &s;pread
about on both &s;ides&mdash;Merely to keep open a Breach between the
Nations, and if po&s;&s;ible to introduce the old Confu&s;ions of their &s;epa|rate
State&mdash;Which GOD of His Infinite Mercy prevent, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
