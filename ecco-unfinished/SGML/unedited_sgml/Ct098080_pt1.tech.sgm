<P>AFTER &s;pending two or three very
agreeable days here, with a party
of friends, in exploring the beauties of
the I&s;land, and dropping a tender tear at
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Cari&s;brook Ca&s;tle on the memory of the
unfortunate Charles the Fir&s;t, I am ju&s;t
&s;etting out for America, on a &s;cheme I
once hinted to you, of &s;ettling the lands
to which I have a right as a lieutenant-colonel
on half pay. On enquiry and ma|ture
deliberation, I prefer Canada to New-York
for two rea&s;ons, that it is wilder,
and that the women are hand&s;omer: the
fir&s;t, perhaps, every body will not ap|prove;
the latter, I am &s;ure, <HI>you</HI> will.</P>
<P>You may perhaps call my project ro|mantic,
but my active temper is ill &s;uited
to the lazy character of a reduc'd officer:
be&s;ides that I am too proud to narrow my
circle of life, and not quite unfeeling
enough to break in on the little e&s;tate
which is &s;carce &s;ufficient to &s;upport my
mother and &s;i&s;ter in the manner to which
they have been accu&s;tom'd.</P>
<P>What you call a &s;acrifice, is none at all;
I love England, but am not ob&s;tinately
<PB N="3" REF="5">
chain'd down to any &s;pot of earth; na|ture
has charms every where for a man
willing to be plea&s;ed: at my time of life,
the very change of place is amu&s;ing; love
of variety, and the natural re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of
man, would give me a reli&s;h for this voyage,
even if I did not expect, what I really do,
to become lord of a principality which will
put our large-acred men in England out of
countenance. My &s;ubjects indeed at pre|&s;ent
will be only bears and elks, but in
time I hope to &s;ee the <HI>human face divine</HI>
multiplying around me; and, in thus cul|tivating
what is in the rude&s;t &s;tate of na|ture,
I &s;hall ta&s;te one of the greate&s;t of
all plea&s;ures, that of creation, and &s;ee
order and beauty gradually ri&s;e from
chaos.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el is unmoor'd; the winds are
fair; a gentle breeze agitates the bo&s;om
of the deep; all nature &s;miles: I go with
all the eager hopes of a warm imagina|tion;
<PB N="4" REF="6">
yet friend&s;hip ca&s;ts a lingering look
behind.</P>
<P>Our mutual lo&s;s, my dear Temple, will
be great. I &s;hall never cea&s;e to regret
you, nor will you find it ea&s;y to replace
the friend of your youth. You may find
friends of equal merit; you may e&s;teem
them equally; but few connexions form'd
after five and twenty &s;trike root like that
early &s;ympathy, which united us almo&s;t
from infancy, and has increas'd to the very
hour of our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure is there in the friend|&s;hips
of the &s;pring of life, before the
world, the mean unfeeling &s;elfi&s;h world,
breaks in on the gay mi&s;takes of the ju&s;t-expanding
heart, which &s;ees nothing but
truth, and has nothing but happine&s;s in
pro&s;pect!</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpriz'd the heathens rais'd
altars to friend&s;hip: 'twas natural for un|taught
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;uper&s;tition to deify the &s;ource of
every good; they wor&s;hip'd friend&s;hip,
which animates the moral world, on the
&s;ame principle as they paid adoration to
the &s;un, which gives life to the world of
nature.</P>
<P>I am &s;ummon'd on board. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>June 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment your letter, my
dear; I am happy to hear my mother
has been amus'd at Bath, and not at all
&s;urpriz'd to find &s;he rivals you in your
conque&s;ts. By the way, I am not &s;ure &s;he
is not hand&s;omer, notwith&s;tanding you tell
<PB N="6" REF="8">
me you are hand&s;omer than ever: I am
a&s;toni&s;h'd &s;he will lead a tall daughter
about with her thus, to let people into a
&s;ecret they would never &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he is
pa&s;t $ive and twenty.</P>
<P>You are a fooli&s;h girl, Lucy: do you
think I have not more plea&s;ure in continu|ing
to my mother, by coming hither, the
little indulgencies of life, than I could have
had by enjoying them my&s;elf? pray re|concile
her to my ab&s;ence, and a&s;&s;ure her
&s;he will make me happier by jovially en|joying
the trifle I have a&s;&s;ign'd to her u&s;e,
than by procuring me the wealth of a
Nabob, in which &s;he was to have no
&s;hare.</P>
<P>But to return; you really, Lucy, a&s;k me
&s;uch a million of que&s;tions, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
to know which to an&s;wer fir&s;t; the coun|try,
the convents, the balls, the ladies, the
beaux&mdash;'tis a hi&s;tory, not a letter, you de|mand,
<PB N="7" REF="9">
and it will take me a twelvemonth
to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Where &s;hall I begin? certainly with
what mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;trike a &s;oldier: I have &s;een
then the &s;pot where the amiable hero ex|pir'd
in the arms of victory; have traced
him &s;tep by &s;tep with equal a&s;toni&s;hment
and admiration: 'tis here alone it is po&s;&s;i|ble
to form an adequate idea of an enter|prize,
the difficulties of which mu&s;t have
de&s;troy'd hope it&s;elf had they been fore|&s;een.</P>
<P>The country is a very fine one: you &s;ee
here not only the <HI>beautiful</HI> which it has in
common with Europe, but the <HI>great &s;ub|lime</HI>
to an amazing degree; every object
here is magnificent: the very people &s;eem
almo&s;t another &s;pecies, if we compare them
with the French from whom they are de|&s;cended.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
On approaching the coa&s;t of America,
I felt a kind of religious veneration, on
&s;eeing rocks which almo&s;t touch'd the
clouds, cover'd with tall groves of pines
that &s;eemed coeval with the world it&s;elf:
to which veneration the &s;olemn &s;ilence not
a little contributed; from Cape Ro&s;ieres,
up the river St. Lawrence, during a cour&s;e
of more than two hundred miles, there is
not the lea&s;t appearance of a human foot|&s;tep;
no objects meet the eye but moun|tains,
woods, and numerous rivers, which
&s;eem to roll their waters in vain.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to behold a &s;cene like
this without lamenting the madne&s;s of
mankind, who, more mercile&s;s than the
fierce inhabitants of the howling wilder|ne&s;s,
de&s;troy millions of their own &s;pecies
in the wild contention for a little portion of
that earth, the far greater part of which
remains yet unpo&s;&s;e&s;t, and courts the hand
of labour for cultivation.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
The river it&s;elf is one of the noble&s;t in
the world; it's breadth is ninety miles at
it's entrance, gradually, and almo&s;t im|perceptibly,
decrea&s;ing; inter&s;pers'd with
i&s;lands which give it a variety infinitely
plea&s;ing, and navigable near five hundred
miles from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;triking than the
view of Quebec as you approach; it &s;tands
on the &s;ummit of a boldly-ri&s;ing hill, at the
confluence of two very beautiful rivers, the
St. Lawrence and St. Charles, and, as the
convents and other public buildings fir&s;t
meet the eye, appears to great advantage
from the port. The i&s;land of Orleans, the
di&s;tant view of the ca&s;cade of Montmo|renci,
and the oppo&s;ite village of Beau|port,
&s;cattered with a plea&s;ing irregularity
along the banks of the river St. Charles,
add greatly to the charms of the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
I have ju&s;t had time to ob&s;erve, that the
Canadian ladies have the vivacity of the
French, with a &s;uperior &s;hare of beauty:
as to balls and a&s;&s;emblies, we have none at
pre&s;ent, it being a kind of interregnum
of government: if I cho&s;e to give you the
political &s;tate of the country, I could fill
volumes with the <HI>pours</HI> and the <HI>contres;</HI>
but I am not one of tho&s;e &s;agacious ob&s;er|vers,
who, by &s;taying a week in a place,
think them&s;elves qualified to give, not
only its natural, but it's moral and political
hi&s;tory: be&s;ides which, you and I are ra|ther
too young to be very profound politi|cians.
We are in expectation of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
from whom we hope a new golden
age; I &s;hall then have better &s;ubjects for
a letter to a lady.</P>
<P>Adieu! my dear girl! &s;ay every thing

<P>INDEED! gone to people the wilds of
America, Ned, and multiply the <HI>hu|man
face divine?</HI> 'tis a project worthy a
tall hand&s;ome colonel of twenty &s;even:
let me &s;ee; five feet, eleven inches, well
made, with fine teeth, &s;peaking eyes, a
military air, and the look of a man of
fa&s;hion: &s;pirit, genero&s;ity, a good under|&s;tanding,
&s;ome knowledge, an ea&s;y addre&s;s,
a compa&s;&s;ionate heart, a &s;trong inclination
for the ladies, and in &s;hort every quality a
gentleman &s;hould have: excellent all the&s;e
for colonization: <HI>prenez garde, mes cheres
dames.</HI> You have nothing again&s;t you,
Ned, but your mode&s;ty; a very u&s;ele&s;s
virtue on French ground, or indeed on
any ground: I wi&s;h you had a little more
<PB N="12" REF="14">
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own merits: remem|ber
that <HI>to know one's &s;elf</HI> the oracle of
Apollo has pronounced to be the perfec|tion
of human wi&s;dom. Our fair friend Mrs.
II&mdash;&s;ays, &startq;Colonel Rivers wants nothing
to make him the mo&s;t agreeable man
breathing but a little da&s;h of the cox-comb.&endq;</P>
<P>For my part, I hate humility in a man of
the world; 'tis wor&s;e than even the hypo|cri&s;y
of the faints: I am not ignorant, and
therefore never deny, that I am a very
hand&s;ome fellow; and I have the plea&s;ure
to find all the women of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t arriv'd from Paris: the divine
Madame De&mdash;is as lovely and as con|&s;tant
as ever; 'twas cruel to leave her, but
who can account for the caprices of the
heart? mine was the prey of a young un|experienc'd
Engli&s;h charmer, ju&s;t come out
of a convent,
<Q>&startq;The bloom of opening flowers&mdash;&endq;</Q>
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Ha, Ned? But I forget; you are for the
full-blown ro&s;e: 'tis a happine&s;s, as we
are friends, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can ever
be rivals; a woman is grown out of my
ta&s;te &s;ome years before &s;he comes up to
yours: ab&s;olutely, Ned, you are too nice;
for my part, I am not &s;o delicate; youth
and beauty are &s;ufficient for me; give me
blooming &s;eventeen, and I cede to you the
whole empire of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>This, I &s;uppo&s;e, will find you trying the
force of your de&s;tructive charms on the &s;a|vage
dames of America; cha&s;ing females
wild as the winds thro' woods as wild as
them&s;elves: I &s;ee you pur&s;uing the &s;tately
relict of &s;ome renown'd Indian chief, &s;ome

&s;ome warlike queen dowager of the

I &s;uppo&s;e; none of the affected coy|ne&s;s

of Europe: your attention there will
be the more obliging, as the Indian heroes,
I am told, are not very attentive to the
charms of the <HI>beau &s;exe.</HI></P>
<P>You are very &s;entimental on the &s;ubject
of friend&s;hip; no one has more exalted
notions of this &s;pecies of affection than
my&s;elf, yet I deny that it gives life to the
moral world; a gallant man, like you,
might have found a more animating prin|ciple:
<Q>O Venus! O Mere de l'Amour!</Q></P>
<P>I am mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly indolent this morn|ing,

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>TO JOHN TEMPLE, E&s;&abque; Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>July 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS very true, Jack; I have no reli&s;h
for <HI>the Mi&s;&s;es;</HI> for puling girls in
hanging &s;leeves, who feel no pa&s;&s;ion but
vanity, and, without any di&s;tingui&s;hing ta&s;te,
are dying for the fir&s;t man who tells them
they are hand&s;ome. Take your boarding-&s;chool
girls; but give me <HI>a woman;</HI> one,
in &s;hort, who has a &s;oul; not a cold inami|mate
form, in&s;en&s;ible to the lively impre&s;|&s;ions
of real love, and unfeeling as the wax
baby &s;he has ju&s;t thrown away.</P>
<P>You will allow Prior to be no bad
judge of female merit; and you may re|member
his Egyptian maid, the favorite of
<PB N="16" REF="18">
the luxurious King Solomon, is painted in
full bloom.</P>
<P>By the way, Jack, there is generally a
certain hoity-toity inelegance of form and
manner at &s;eventeen, which in my opinion
is not balanc'd by fre&s;hne&s;s of complexion,
the only advantage girls have to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>I have another objection to girls, which
is, that they will eternally fancy every man
they conver&s;e with has de&s;igns; a coquet
and a prude <HI>in the bud</HI> are equally di&s;agree|able;
the former expects univer&s;al adora|tion,
the latter is alarm'd even at that ge|neral
civility which is the right of all their
&s;ex; of the two however the la&s;t is, I think,
much the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome; I wi&s;h the&s;e
very apprehen&s;ive young ladies knew,
their <HI>virtue</HI> is not half &s;o often in danger as
they imagine, and that there are many
male creatures to whom they may &s;afely
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;hew politene&s;s without being drawn into
any conce&s;&s;ions incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t
honor. We are not half &s;uch terrible ani|mals
as mammas, nur&s;es, and novels repre|&s;ent
us; and, if my opinion is of any
weight, I am inclin'd to believe tho&s;e tre|mendous
men, who have de&s;igns on the
whole &s;ex, are, and ever were, characters
as fabulous as the giants of romance.</P>
<P>Women after twenty begin to know this,
and therefore conver&s;e with us on the foot|ing
of rational creatures, without either
fearing or expecting to find every man a
lover.</P>
<P>To do the ladies ju&s;tice however, I have
&s;een the &s;ame ab&s;urdity in my own &s;ex,
and have ob&s;erved many a very good &s;ort
of man turn pale at the politene&s;s of an
agreeable woman.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
I lament this mi&s;take, in both &s;exes, be|cau&s;e
it takes greatly from the plea&s;ure of
mix'd &s;ociety, the only &s;ociety for which I
have any reli&s;h.</P>
<P>Don't, however, fancy that, becau&s;e I
di&s;like <HI>the Mi&s;&s;es,</HI> I have a ta&s;te for their
grandmothers; there is a golden mean,
Jack, of which you &s;eem to have no idea.</P>
<P>You are very ill inform'd as to the man|ners
of the Indian ladies; 'tis in the bud
alone the&s;e wild ro&s;es are acce&s;&s;ible; libe|ral
to profu&s;ion of their charms before mar|riage,
they are cha&s;tity it&s;elf after: the
moment they commence wives, they give
up the very idea of plea&s;ing, and turn all
their thoughts to the cares, and tho&s;e not
the mo&s;t delicate cares, of dome&s;tic life:
laborious, hardy, active, they plough the
ground, they &s;ow, they reap; whil&s;t the
<PB N="19" REF="21">
haughty hu&s;band amu&s;es him&s;elf with
hunting, &s;hooting, fi&s;hing, and &s;uch exer|ci&s;es
only as are the image of war; all
other employments being, according to his
idea, unworthy the dignity of man.</P>
<P>I have told you the labors of &s;avage life,
but I &s;hould ob&s;erve that they are only tem|porary,
and when urg'd by the &s;harp tooth
of nece&s;&s;ity: their lives are, upon the whole,
idle beyond any thing we can conceive. If
the Epicurean definition of happine&s;s is
ju&s;t, that it con&s;i&s;ts in indolence of body,
and tranquillity of mind, the Indians of
both &s;exes are the happie&s;t people on
earth; free from all care, they enjoy the
pre&s;ent moment, forget the pa&s;t, and are
without &s;olicitude for the future: in &s;um|mer,
&s;tretch'd on the verdant turf, they
&s;ing, they laugh, they play, they relate
&s;tories of their ancient heroes to warm the
youth to war; in winter, wrap'd in the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
furs which bounteous nature provides them,
they dance, they fea&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;e the ri|gors
of the &s;ea&s;on, at which the more effe|minate
Europeans tremble.</P>
<P>War being however the bu&s;ine&s;s of their
lives, and the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of their &s;ouls,
their very plea&s;ures take their colors from
it: every one mu&s;t have heard of the war
dance, and their &s;ongs are almo&s;t all on the
&s;ame &s;ubject: on the mo&s;t diligent enquiry,
I find but one love &s;ong in their language,
which is &s;hort and &s;imple, tho' perhaps not
inexpre&s;&s;ive:
<Q><L>&startq;I love you,</L>
<L>I love you dearly,</L>
<L>I love you all day long.&endq;</L></Q>
An old Indian told me, they had al&s;o &s;ongs
of friend&s;hip, but I could never procure a
tran&s;lation of one of them: on my pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="23">
this Indian to tran&s;late one into French for
me, he told me with a haughty air, the
Indians were not us'd to make tran&s;lations,
and that if I cho&s;e to under&s;tand their &s;ongs
I mu&s;t learn their language. By the way,
their language is extremely harmonious,
e&s;pecially as pronounced by their women,
and as well adapted to mu&s;ic as Italian it|&s;elf.
I mu&s;t not here omit an in&s;tance of
their independent &s;pirit, which is, that
they never would &s;ubmit to have the &s;er|vice
of the church, tho' they profe&s;s the
Romi&s;h religion, in any language but their
own; the women, who have in general
fine voices, &s;ing in the choir with a ta&s;te
and manner that would &s;urprize you, and
with a devotion that might edify more po|li&s;h'd
nations.</P>
<P>The Indian women are tall and well
&s;haped; have good eyes, and before mar|riage
are, except their color, and their
<PB N="22" REF="24">
coar&s;e grea&s;y black hair, very far from
being di&s;agreeable; but the laborious life
they afterwards lead is extremely unfa|vorable
to beauty; they become coar&s;e and
ma&s;culine, and lo&s;e in a year or two the
power as well as the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing. To
compen&s;ate however for the lo&s;s of their
charms, they acquire a new empire in mar|rying;
are con&s;ulted in all affairs of &s;tate,
chu&s;e a chief on every vacancy of the
throne, are &s;overeign arbiters of peace
and war, as well as of the fate of tho&s;e
unhappy captives that have the misfortune
to fall into their hands, who are adopted
as children, or put to the mo&s;t cruel death,
as the wives of the conquerors &s;mile or
frown.</P>
<P>A Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionary told me a &s;tory on
this &s;ubject, which one cannot hear with|out
horror: an Indian woman with whom
he liv'd on his mi&s;&s;ion was feeding her chil|dren,
when her hu&s;band brought in an
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Engli&s;h pri&s;oner; &s;he immediately cut off
his arm, and gave her children the &s;tream|ing
blood to drink: the Je&s;uit remon&s;trated
on the cruelty of the action, on which,
looking &s;ternly at him, &startq;I would have them
warriors,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;and therefore feed
them with the food of men.&endq;</P>
<P>This anecdote may perhaps di&s;gu&s;t you
with the Indian ladies, who certainly do not
excel in female &s;oftne&s;s. I will therefore
turn to the Canadian, who have every
charm except that without which all other
charms are to me in&s;ipid, I mean &s;en&s;ibi|lity:
they are gay, coquet, and &s;prightly;
more gallant than &s;en&s;ible; more flatter'd
by the vanity of in&s;piring pa&s;&s;ion, than ca|pable
of feeling it them&s;elves; and, like
their European countrywomen, prefer the
outward attentions of unmeaning admira|tion
to the real devotion of the heart. There
is not perhaps on earth a race of females,
who talk &s;o much, or feel &s;o little, of love

<P>WHAT an incon&s;tant animal is man!
do you know, Lucy, I begin to be
tir'd of the lovely land&s;cape round me? I
have enjoy'd from it all the plea&s;ure meer
inanimate objects can give, and find 'tis a
plea&s;ure that &s;oon &s;atiates, if not relieved
by others which are more lively. The
&s;cenery is to be &s;ure divine, but one grows
weary of meer &s;cenery: the mo&s;t enchant|ing
pro&s;pect &s;oon lo&s;es its power of plea&s;|ing,
when the eye is accu&s;tom'd to it: we
gaze at fir&s;t tran&s;ported on the charms of
nature, and fancy they will plea&s;e for ever;
but, alas! it will not do; we &s;igh for &s;o|ciety,
the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e dear to us;
the more animated plea&s;ures of the heart.
There are &s;ine women, and men of merit
<PB N="26" REF="28">
here; but, as the affections are not in our
power, I have not yet felt my heart gravi|tate
towards any of them. I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely
&s;et in earne&s;t about my &s;ettlement, in order
to emerge from the &s;tate of vegetation into
which I &s;eem falling.</P>
<P>But to your la&s;t: you a&s;k me a particu|lar
account of the convents here. Have
you an inclination, my dear, to turn nun?
if you have, you could not have applied to
a properer per&s;on; my extreme mode&s;ty
and re&s;erve, and my &s;peaking French, hav|ing
made me already a great favourite with
the older part of all the three communities,
who unanimou&s;ly declare colonel Rivers to
be <HI>un tres aimable homme,</HI> and have given me
an unlimited liberty of vi&s;iting them when|ever
I plea&s;e: they now and then treat <HI>me</HI>
with a &s;ight of &s;ome of the young ones,
but this is a favor not allow'd to all the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
There are three religious hou&s;es at Que|bec,
&s;o you have choice; the Ur&s;ulines,
the Hotel Dieu, and the General Ho&s;pital.
The fir&s;t is the &s;evere&s;t order in the Romi&s;h
church, except that very cruel one which
denies its fair votaries the ine&s;timable li|berty
of &s;peech. The hou&s;e is large and
hand&s;ome, but has an air of gloomine&s;s,
with which the black habit, and the livid
palene&s;s of the nuns, extremely corre|&s;ponds.
The church is, contrary to the &s;tyle
of the re&s;t of the convent, ornamented and
lively to the la&s;t degree. The &s;uperior is
an Engli&s;h-woman of good family, who
was taken pri&s;oner by the &s;avages when a
child, and plac'd here by the genero&s;ity of
a French officer. She is one of the mo&s;t
amiable women I ever knew, with a bene|volence
in her countenance which in&s;pires
all who &s;ee her with affection: I am very
&s;ond of her conver&s;ation, tho' &s;ixty and a
nun.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
The Hotel Dieu is very plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated,
with a view of the two rivers, and
the entrance of the port: the hou&s;e is
chearful, airy, and agreeable; the habit
extremely becoming, a circum&s;tance a hand|&s;ome
woman ought by no means to over|look;
'tis white with a black gauze veil,
which would &s;hew your complexion to
great advantage. The order is much le&s;s
&s;evere than the Ur&s;ulines, and I might add,
much more u&s;eful, their province being the
care of the &s;ick: the nuns of this hou&s;e
are &s;prightly, and have a look of health
which is wanting at the Ur&s;ulines.</P>
<P>The General Ho&s;pital, &s;ituated about a
mile out of town, on the borders of the
river St. Charles, is much the mo&s;t agree|able
of the three. The order and the ha|bit
are the &s;ame with the Hotel Dieu, ex|cept
that to the habit is added the cro&s;s,
gererally worn in Europe by canone&s;&s;es
only: a di&s;tinction procur'd &s;or them by
<PB N="29" REF="31">
their founder, St. Vallier, the &s;econd bi|&s;hop
of Quebec. The hou&s;e is, without,
a very noble building; and neatne&s;s, ele|gance
and propriety reign within. The
nuns, who are all of the noble&s;&s;e, are
many of them hand&s;ome, and all genteel,
lively, and well bred; they have an air of
the world, their conver&s;ation is ea&s;y, &s;pi|rited,
and polite: with them you almo&s;t
forget the reclu&s;e in the woman of condi|tion.
In &s;hort, you have the be&s;t nuns at
the Ur&s;ulines, the mo&s;t agreeable women
at the General Ho&s;pital: all however have
an air of chagrin, which they in vain en|deavour
to conceal; and the general eager|ne&s;s
with which they tell you $word$ they
are happy, is a &s;trong proof of the con|trary.</P>
<P>Tho' the mo&s;t indulgent of all men to the
follies of others, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have
their &s;ource in mi&s;taken devotion; tho'
willing to allow all the world to play the
&s;ool their own way, yet I cannot help
<PB N="30" REF="32">
being fir'd with a degree of zeal again&s;t an
in&s;titution equally incompatible with public
good, and private happine&s;s; an in&s;titution
which cruelly devotes beauty and innocence
to &s;lavery, regret, and wretchedne&s;s; to a
more irk&s;ome impri&s;onment than the &s;e|vere&s;t
laws inflict on the wor&s;t of crimi|nals.</P>
<P>Could any thing but experience, my dear
Lucy, make it be believ'd po&s;&s;ible that
there &s;hould be rational beings, who think
they are &s;erving the God of mercy by in|flicting
on them&s;elves voluntary tortures,
and cutting them&s;elves off from that &s;tate
of &s;ociety in which he has plac'd them, and
for which they were form'd? by renounc|ing
the be&s;t affections of the human heart,
the tender names of friend, of wife, of mo|ther?
and, as far as in them lies, counter|working
creation? by &s;purning from them
every amu&s;ement however innocent, by
refu&s;ing the gifts of that bene&s;icent power
<PB N="31" REF="33">
who made us to be happy, and de&s;troying
his mo&s;t precious gifts, health, beauty, &s;en|&s;ibility,
chearfulne&s;s, and peace!</P>
<P>My indignation is yet awake, from hav|ing
&s;een a few days &s;ince at the Urfulines,
an extreme lovely young girl, who&s;e coun|tenance
&s;poke a &s;oul form'd for the mo&s;t
lively, yet delicate, ties of love and friend|&s;hip,
led by a momentary enthu&s;ia&s;m, or
perhaps by a childi&s;h vanity artfully ex|cited,
to the foot of tho&s;e altars, which &s;he
will probably too &s;oon bathe with the bitter
tears of repentance and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>The ceremony, form'd to &s;trike the ima|gination,
and &s;educe the heart of unguarded
youth, is extremely &s;olemn and affecting;
the proce&s;&s;ion of the nuns, the &s;weetne&s;s
of their voices in the choir, the dignified
devotion with which the charming enthu|&s;ia&s;t
received the veil, and took the cruel
vow which &s;hut her from the world for ever,
&s;truck my heart in &s;pite of my rea&s;on, and
<PB N="32" REF="34">
I felt my&s;elf touch'd even to tears by a &s;u|per&s;tition
I equally pity and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>I am not however certain it was the cere|mony
which affected me thus &s;trongly; it
was impo&s;&s;ible not to feel for this amiable
victim; never was there an object more in|tere&s;ting;
her form was elegance it&s;elf;
her air and motion animated and graceful;
the glow of plea&s;ure was on her cheek, the
fire of enthu&s;ia&s;m in her eyes, which are
the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw: never did I &s;ee joy &s;o
livelily painted on the countenance of the
happie&s;t bride; &s;he &s;eem'd to walk in air;
her whole per&s;on look'd more than human.</P>
<P>An enemy to every &s;$ecies of &s;uper&s;tition,
I mu&s;t however allow it to be lea&s;t de&s;truc|tive
to true virtue in your gentle &s;ex, and
therefore to be indulg'd with lea&s;t danger:
the &s;uper&s;tition of men is gloomy and fe|rocious;
it lights the fire, and points the
dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; whil&s;t that of wo|men
<PB N="33" REF="35">
takes its color from the &s;ex; is &s;oft,
mild, and benevolent; exerts it&s;elf in acts
of kindne&s;s and charity, and &s;eems only
&s;ub&s;tituting the love of God to that of man.</P>
<P>Who can help admiring, whil&s;t they
pity, the foundre&s;s of the Ur&s;uline con|vent,
Madame de la Peltric, to whom the
very colony in &s;ome mea&s;ure owes its ex|i&s;tence?
young, rich and lovely; a widow
in the bloom of life, mi&s;tre&s;s of her own
actions, the world was gay before her, yet
&s;he left all the plea&s;ures that world could
give, to devote her days to the &s;everities of
a religion &s;he thought the only true one:
&s;he dar'd the dangers of the &s;ea, and the
greater dangers of a &s;avage people; &s;he
landed on an unknown &s;hore, &s;ubmitted to
the extremities of cold and heat, of thir&s;t
and hunger, to perform a &s;ervice &s;he
thought acceptable to the Deity. To an
action like this, however mi&s;taken the mo|tive,
bigotry alone will deny prai&s;e: the
man of candor will only lament that minds
<PB N="34" REF="36">
capable of &s;uch heroic virtue are not di|rected
to views more conducive to their own
and the general happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am unexpectedly call'd this moment,

from whence you &s;hall hear from me.</P>

<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>July 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM arriv'd, my dear, and have brought
my heart &s;afe thro' &s;uch a continued &s;ire
as never poor knight errant was expo&s;ed
to; waited on at every &s;tage by blooming
country girls, full of &s;pirit and coquetry,
without any of the village ba&s;hfulne&s;s of
<PB N="35" REF="37">
England, and dre&s;&s;ed like the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es
of romance. A man of adventure might
make a plea&s;ant journey to Montreal.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are ignorant, lazy, dirty,
and &s;tupid beyond all belief; but ho&s;pita|ble,
courteous, civil; and, what is parti|cularly
agreeable, they leave their wives
and daughters to do the honors of the hou&s;e:
in which obliging office they acquit them|&s;elves
with an attention, which, amid&s;t every
inconvenience apparent (tho' I am told not
real) poverty can cau&s;e, mu&s;t plea&s;e every
gue&s;t who has a &s;oul inclin'd to be pleas'd:
for my part, I was charm'd with them, and
eat my homely fare with as much plea&s;ure
as if I had been fea&s;ting on ortolans in a pa|lace.
Their conver&s;ation is lively and amu&s;|ing;
all the little knowledge of Canada is
con&s;ined to the &s;ex; very few, even of the
&s;$igneurs, being able to write their own
names.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
The road from Quebec to Montreal is
almo&s;t a continued &s;treet, the villages being
numerous, and &s;o extended along the banks
of the river St. Lawrence as to leave &s;carce
a &s;pace without hou&s;es in view; except
where here or there a river, a wood, or
mountain intervenes, as if to give a more
plea&s;ing variety to the &s;cene. I don't re|member
ever having had a more agreeable
journey; the fine pro&s;pects of the day &s;o
enliven'd by the gay chat of the evening,
that I was really &s;orry when I approach'd
Montreal.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Montreal, on which the
town &s;tands, is a very lovely &s;pot; highly
cultivated, and tho' le&s;s wild and magnifi|cent,
more &s;miling than the country round
Quebec: the ladies, who &s;eem to make
plea&s;ure their only bu&s;ine&s;s, and mo&s;t of
whom I have &s;een this morning driving
about the town in cala&s;hes, and making
<PB N="37" REF="39">
what they call, the <HI>tour de la ville,</HI> at|tended
by Engli&s;h officers, &s;eem generally
hand&s;ome, and have an air of &s;prightline&s;s
with which I am charm'd; I mu&s;t be ac|quainted
with them all, for tho' my &s;tay is
to be &s;hort, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why it &s;hould
be dull. I am told they are fond of little
rural balls in the country, and intend to
give one as &s;oon as I have paid my re&s;pects
in form.</P>
<P>Six in the evening.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t come from dining with the&mdash;
regiment, and find I have a vi&s;it to pay I was
not aware of, to two Engli&s;h ladies who are
a few miles out of town: one of them is
wife to the major of the regiment, and the
other ju&s;t going to be married to a captain
in it, Sir George Clayton, a young hand|&s;ome
baronet, ju&s;t come to his title and a
very fine e&s;tate, by the death of a di&s;tant
relation: he is at pre&s;ent at New York $word$
I am told they are to be married as &s;oon as
he comes back.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
Eight o'clock.</P>
<P>I have been making &s;ome flying vi&s;its to
the French ladies; tho' I have not &s;een
many beauties, yet in general the women
are hand&s;ome; their manner is ea&s;y and
obliging, they make the mo&s;t of their
charms by their vivacity, and I certainly
cannot be di&s;pleas'd with their extreme
partiality for the Engli&s;h officers; their
own men, who indeed are not very attrac|tive,
have not the lea&s;t chance for any &s;hare
in their good graces.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day morning.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t &s;etting out with a friend for
Major Melmoth's, to pay my compliments
to the two ladies: I have no reli&s;h for this
vi&s;it; I hate mi&s;&s;es that are going to be
married; they are always &s;o full of the
dear man, that they have not common civi|lity
to other people. I am told however
both the ladies are agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
<DATE>14th.</DATE> Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>Agreeable, Lucy! &s;he is an angel: 'tis
happy for me &s;he is engag'd; nothing el&s;e
could &s;ecure my heart, of which you know
I am very tenacious: only think of finding
beauty, delicacy, &s;en&s;ibility, all that can
charm in woman, hid in a wood in Ca|nada!</P>
<P>You &s;ay I am given to be enthu&s;ia&s;tic
in my approbations, but &s;he is really
charming. I am re&s;olv'd not only to have
a friend&s;hip for her my&s;elf, but that <HI>you</HI>
&s;hall, and have told her &s;o; &s;he comes to
England as &s;oon as &s;he is married; you
are form'd to love each other.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tell you; Major Melmoth
kept us a week at his hou&s;e in the country,
in one continued round of rural amu&s;e|ments;
by which I do not mean hunting
and &s;hooting, but &s;uch plea&s;ures as the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
ladies could &s;hare; little ru&s;tic balls and
parties round the neighbouring country, in
which parties we were joined by all the
fine women at Montreal. Mrs. Melmoth is
a very plea&s;ing, genteel brunette, but Emily
Montague&mdash;you will &s;ay I am in love with
her if I de&s;cribe her, and yet I declare to
you I am not: knowing &s;he loves another,
to whom &s;he is &s;oon to be united, I &s;ee her
charms with the &s;ame kind of plea&s;ure I
do yours; a plea&s;ure, which, tho' ex|tremely
lively, is by our &s;ituation without
the lea&s;t mixture of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, &s;he is charming; there are
men here who do not think &s;o, but to me
&s;he is loveline&s;s it&s;elf. My ideas of beauty
are perhaps a little out of the common
road: I hate a woman of whom every
man coldly &s;ays, <HI>&s;he is hand&s;ome;</HI> I adore
beauty, but it is not meer features or com|plexion
to which I give that name; 'tis life,
'tis &s;pirit, 'tis animation, 'tis&mdash;in one word,
'tis Emily Montague&mdash;without being re|gularly
<PB N="41" REF="43">
beautiful, &s;he charms every &s;en&s;ible
heart; all other women, however lovely,
appear marble &s;tatues near her: fair; pale
(a palene&s;s which gives the idea of delicacy
without de&s;troying that of health), with
dark hair and eyes, the latter large and
langui&s;hing, &s;he &s;eems made to feel to a
trembling exce&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he cannot fail
of in&s;piring: her elegant form has an air
of &s;oftne&s;s and languor, which &s;eizes the
whole &s;oul in a moment: her eyes, the
mo&s;t intelligent I ever &s;aw, hold you en|chain'd
by their bewitching &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>There are a thou&s;and un&s;peakable charms
in her conver&s;ation; but what I am mo&s;t
pleas'd with, is the attentive politene&s;s of
her manner, which you &s;eldom &s;ee in a
per&s;on in love; the extreme de&s;ire of
plea&s;ing one man generally taking off greatly
from the attention due to all the re&s;t. This
is partly owing to her admirable under|&s;tanding,
and partly to the natural &s;oft|ne&s;s
<PB N="42" REF="44">
of her &s;oul, which gives her the
&s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of plea&s;ing. As I am a
philo&s;opher in the&s;e matters, and have
made the heart my &s;tudy, I want extremely
to &s;ee her with her lover, and to ob&s;erve
the gradual encrea&s;e of her charms in his
pre&s;ence; love, which embelli&s;hes the mo&s;t
unmeaning countenance, mu&s;t give to her's
a fire irre&s;i&s;tible: what eyes! when ani|mated
by tenderne&s;s!</P>
<P>The very &s;oul acquires a new force and
beauty by loving; a woman of honor ne|ver
appears half &s;o amiable, or di&s;plays
half &s;o many virtues, as when &s;en&s;ible to
the merit of a man who de&s;erves her af|fection.
Ob&s;erve, Lucy, I &s;hall never
allow you to be hand&s;ome till I hear you
are in love.</P>
<P>Did I tell you Emily Montague had the
$ine&s;t hand and arm in the world? I &s;hould
however have excepted yours: her tone of
voice too has the &s;ame melodious &s;weetne&s;s,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
a perfection without which the lovelie&s;t
woman could never make the lea&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion
on my heart: I don't think you are
very unlike upon the whole, except that
&s;he is paler. You know, Lucy, you have
often told me I &s;hould certainly have been
in love with you if I had not been your
brother: this re&s;emblance is a proof you
were right. You are really as hand&s;ome as
any woman can be who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility has
never been put in motion.</P>
<P>I am to give a ball to-morrow; Mrs.
Melmoth is to have the honors of it, but as
&s;he is with child, &s;he does not dance. This
circum&s;tance has produc'd a di&s;pute not a
little flattering to my vanity: the ladies
are making intere&s;t to dance with me;
what a happy exchange have I made! what
man of common &s;en&s;e would &s;tay to be
overlook'd in England, who can have ri|val
beauties contend for him in Canada?
This important point is not yet &s;ettled; the
<HI>etiquette</HI> here is rather difficult to adju&s;t;
<PB N="44" REF="46">
as to me, I have nothing to do in the con|&s;ultation;
my hand is de&s;tin'd to the longe&s;t
pedigree; we &s;tand prodigiou&s;ly on our
noble&s;&s;e at Montreal.</P>
<P>Four o'clock.</P>
<P>After a di&s;pute in which two French la|dies
were near drawing their hu&s;bands into
a duel, the point of honor is yielded by
both to Mi&s;s Montague; each in&s;i&s;ting only
that I &s;hould not dance with the other: for
my part, I &s;ubmit with a good grace, as
you will &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Saturday morning.</P>
<P>I never pa&s;&s;ed a more agreeable evening:
we have our amu&s;ements here, I a&s;&s;ure you:
a &s;et of fine young fellows, and hand&s;ome
women, all well dre&s;s'd, and in humor with
them&s;elves, and with each other: my lovely
Emily like Venus among&s;t the Graces, only
multiplied to about &s;ixteen. Nothing is, in
<PB N="45" REF="47">
my opinion, &s;o favorable to the di&s;play of
beauty as a ball. A &s;tate of re&s;t is ungrace|ful;
all nature is mo&s;t beautiful in motion;
trees agitated by the wind, a &s;hip under &s;ail,
a hor&s;e in the cour&s;e, a fine woman danc|ing:
never any human being had &s;uch an
aver&s;ion to &s;till life as I have.</P>
<P>I am going back to Melmoth's for a
month; don't be alarm'd, Lucy! I &s;ee all
her perfections, but I &s;ee them with the
cold eye of admiration only: a woman en|gaged
lo&s;es all her attractions as a woman;
there is no love without a ray of hope: my

<P>BY Heavens, Lucy, this is more than
man can bear; I was mad to &s;tay &s;o
long at Melmoth's; there is no re&s;i&s;ting
this little &s;educer: 'tis &s;hameful in &s;uch a
lovely woman to have under&s;tanding too;
yet even this I could forgive, had &s;he not
that enchanting &s;oftne&s;s in her manner,
which &s;teals upon the &s;oul, and would al|mo&s;t
make ugline&s;s it&s;elf charm; were &s;he
but vain, one had &s;ome chance, but &s;he will
take upon her to have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, at
lea&s;t no apparent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, of her per|fections,
which is really intolerable. I told
her &s;o la&s;t night, when &s;he put on &s;uch a
malicious &s;mile&mdash;I believe the little tyrant
wants to add me to the li&s;t of her &s;laves;
but I was not form'd to &s;ill up a train. The
<PB N="47" REF="49">
woman I love mu&s;t be &s;o far from giving
another the preference, that &s;he mu&s;t have
no &s;oul but for me; I am one of the mo&s;t
unrea&s;onable men in the world on this head;
&s;he may fancy what &s;he plea&s;es, but I &s;et
her and all her attractions at defiance: I
have made my e&s;cape, and &s;hall &s;et off for
Quebec in an hour. Flying is, I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
a little out of character, and
unbecoming a &s;oldier; but in the&s;e ca&s;es,
it is the very be&s;t thing man or woman
either can do, when they doubt their
powers of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I intend to be ten days going to Quebec.
I propo&s;e vi&s;iting the prie&s;ts at every vil|lage,
and endeavouring to get &s;ome know|ledge
of the nature of the country, in or|der
to my intended &s;ettlement. Idlene&s;s be|ing
the root of all evil, and the nur&s;e of
love, I am determin'd to keep my&s;elf em|ployed;
nothing can be better &s;uited to
my temper than my pre&s;ent de&s;ign; the
plea&s;ure of cultivating lands here is as much
<PB N="48" REF="50">
&s;uperior to what can be found in the &s;ame
employment in England, as watching the
expanding ro&s;e, and beholding the falling
leaves: America is in infancy, Europe in
old age. Nor am I very ill qualified for this
agreable ta&s;k: I have &s;tudied the Georgicks,
and am a pretty enough kind of a hu&s;band|man
as far as theory goes; nay, I am not
&s;ure I &s;hall not be, even in practice, the
be&s;t <HI>gentleman</HI> farmer in the province.</P>
<P>You may expect &s;oon to hear of me in
the <HI>Mu&s;eum Ru&s;ticum;</HI> I intend to make
amazing di&s;coveries in the rural way: I
have already found out, by the &s;orce of
my own genius, two very uncommon cir|cum&s;tances;
that in Canada, contrary to
what we &s;ee every where el&s;e, the country
is rich, the capital poor; the hills fruitful,
the vallies barren. You &s;ee what excellent
di&s;po&s;itions I have to be an u&s;eful member

<P>YOU can't think, my dear, what a
fund of u&s;eful knowledge I have
trea&s;ur'd up during my journey from Mon|treal.
This colony is a rich mine yet uno|pen'd;
I do not mean of gold and &s;ilver,
but of what are of much more real value,
corn and cattle. Nothing is wanting but
encouragement and cultivation; the Cana|dians
are at their ea&s;e even without labor;
nature is here a bounteous mother, who
pours forth her gifts almo&s;t un&s;olicited:
bigotry, &s;tupidity, and lazine&s;s, united,
have not been able to keep the pea&s;antry
poor. I rejoice to find &s;uch admirable ca|pabilities
where I propo&s;e to fix my domi|nion.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
I was ho&s;pitably entertained by the cur&eacute;s
all the way down, tho' they are in general
but ill provided for: the parochial clergy
are u&s;eful every where, but I have a great
aver&s;ion to monks, tho&s;e drones in the po|litical
hive, who&s;e whole &s;tudy &s;eems to be
to make them&s;elves as u&s;ele&s;s to the world
as po&s;&s;ible. Think too of the &s;hocking $ndelicacy
of many of them, who make it a
point of religion to abjure linen, and wear
their habits till they drop off. How a&s;to|ni&s;hing
that any mind &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the
Deity an enemy to cleanline&s;s! the Jewi&s;h
religion was hardly any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>I paid my re&s;pects wherever I &s;topped, to
the <HI>&s;eigneure&s;s</HI> of the village; for as to the
&s;eigneurs, except two or three, if they had
not wives, they would not be worth vi&s;iting.</P>
<P>I am every day more plea&s;ed with the
women here; and, if I was gallant, &s;hould
be in danger of being a convert to the
<PB N="52" REF="54">
French &s;tile of gallantry; which certainly
deba&s;es the mind much le&s;s than ours.</P>
<P>But what is all this to my Emily? How I
envy Sir George! what happine&s;s has Hea|ven
prepared for him, if he has a &s;oul to
ta&s;te it!</P>
<P>I really mu&s;t not think of her; I found
&s;o much delight in her conver&s;ation, it was
quite time to come away; I am almo&s;t
a&s;hamed to own how much difficulty I found
in leaving her: do you know I have &s;carce
&s;lept &s;ince? This is ab&s;urd, but I cannot
help it; which by the way is an admirable
excu&s;e for any thing.</P>
<P>I have been come but two hours, and
am going to Silleri, to pay my compliments
to your friend Mi&s;s Formor, who arrived
with her father, who comes to join his re|giment,
&s;ince I le&s;t Quebec. I hear there

<P>I CANNOT, Madam, expre&s;s my obli|gation

he will excu&s;e my an&s;wering the whole to

&s;olicitous to plea&s;e you than him, for a
thou&s;and rea&s;ons too tedious to mention.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">
I thought you had more penetration than
to &s;uppo&s;e me indifferent: on the contrary,
&s;en&s;ibility is my fault; though it is not
your little every-day beauties who can ex|cite
it: I have admirable di&s;po&s;itions to
love, though I am hard to plea&s;e: in &s;hort,

I can love <HI>like an angel,</HI> when I &s;et in earne&s;t

in love with your hu&s;band; and your friend
is in a &s;ituation &s;till more unfavorable to a
lover's hopes. This is particularly unfortu|nate,
as you are the only two of your be|witching

heart feels the lea&s;t &s;ympathy. To be plain,
but don't tell the little Major, I am more

There is one virtue I admire extremely

you appeared &s;eparate, where is the hero

<P>I HAVE been a month arrived, my dear,
without having &s;een your brother, who
is at Montreal, but I am told is expected
to-day. I have &s;pent my time however
very agreably. I know not what the win|ter
may be, but I am enchanted with the
beauty of this country in &s;ummer; bold,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
picture&s;que, romantic, nature reigns here
in all her wanton luxuriance, adorned by a
thou&s;and wild graces which mock the cul|tivated
beauties of Europe. The &s;cenery
about the town is infinitely lovely; the
pro&s;pect exten&s;ive, and diver&s;ified by a va|riety
of hills, woods, rivers, ca&s;cades, in|termingled
with &s;miling farms and cottages,
and bounded by di&s;tant mountains which
&s;eem to &s;cale the very Heavens.</P>
<P>The days are much hotter here than in
England, but the heat is more &s;upportable
from the breezes which always &s;pring up
about noon; and the evenings are charm|ing
beyond expre&s;&s;ion. We have much
thunder and lightening, but very few in|&s;tances
of their being fatal: the thunder is
more magnificent and aweful than in Eu|rope,
and the lightening brighter and more
beautiful; I have even &s;een it of a clear
pale purple, re&s;embling the gay tints of
the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">
The verdure is equal to that of England,
and in the evening acquires an un&s;peak|able
beauty from the lucid &s;plendor of the
fire-flies &s;parkling like a thou&s;and little
&s;tars on the trees and on the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>There are two very noble falls of water
near Quebec, la Chaudiere and Montmo|renci:
the former is a prodigious &s;heet of
water, ru&s;hing over the wilde&s;t rocks, and
forming a &s;cene grote&s;que, irregular, a&s;to|ni&s;hing:
the latter, le&s;s wild, le&s;s irregular,
but more plea&s;ing and more maje&s;tic, falls
from an immen&s;e height, down the &s;ide of
a romantic mountain, into the river St.
Lawrence, oppo&s;ite the mo&s;t &s;miling part
of the i&s;land of Orleans, to the cultivated
charms of which it forms the mo&s;t &s;triking
and agreeable contra&s;t.</P>
<P>The river of the &s;ame name, which &s;up|plies
the ca&s;cade of Montmorenci, is the
mo&s;t lovely of all inaminate objects: but
<PB N="59" REF="61">
why do I call it inanimate? It almo&s;t
breathes; I no longer wonder at the enthu|&s;ia&s;m
of Greece and Rome; 'twas from
objects re&s;embling this their mythology took
its ri&s;e; it &s;eems the re&s;idence of a thou|&s;and
deities.</P>
<P>Paint to your&s;elf a &s;tupendous rock
bur&s;t as it were in &s;under by the hands of
nature, to give pa&s;&s;age to a &s;mall, but very
deep and beautiful river; and forming on
each &s;ide a regular and magnificent wall,
crowned with the noble&s;t woods that can
be imagined; the &s;ides of the&s;e romantic
walls adorned with a variety of the gaye&s;t
flowers, and in many places little &s;treams of
the pure&s;t water gu&s;hing through, and lo|&s;ing
them&s;elves in the river below: a thou|&s;and
natural grottoes in the rock make you
&s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf in the abode of the Nereids;
as a little i&s;land, covered with &s;lowering
&s;hrubs, about a mile above the falls, where
the river enlarges it&s;elf as if to give it room,
&s;eems intended for the throne of the river
<PB N="60" REF="62">
godde&s;s. Beyond this, the rapids, formed
by the irregular projections of the rock,
which in &s;ome places &s;eem almo&s;t to meet,
rival in beauty, as they excel in variety,
the ca&s;cade it&s;elf, and clo&s;e this little world
of enchantment.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the loveline&s;s of this fairy &s;cene
alone more than pays the fatigues of my
voyage; and, if I ever murmur at having
cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, remind me that I
have &s;een the river Montmorenci.</P>
<P>I can give you a very imperfect account of
the people here; I have only examined the
land&s;cape about Quebec, and have given very
little attention to the figures; the French
ladies are hand&s;ome, but as to the beaux,
they appear to me not at all dangerous,
and one might &s;afely walk in a wood by
moonlight with the mo&s;t agreeable French|man
here. I am not &s;urprized the Cana|dian
ladies take &s;uch pains to &s;educe our
<PB N="61" REF="63">
men from us; but I think it a little hard we
have no temptation to make repri&s;als.</P>
<P>I am at pre&s;ent at an extreme pretty
farm on the banks of the river St. Law|rence;
the hou&s;e &s;tands at the foot of a
&s;teep mountain covered with a variety of
trees, forming a verdant &s;loping wall, which
ri&s;es in a kind of regular confu&s;ion,
&startq;Shade above &s;hade, a woody theatre,&endq;
and has in front this noble river, on which
the &s;hips continually pa&s;&s;ing pre&s;ent to the
delighted eye the mo&s;t charming moving
picture imaginable; I never &s;aw a place &s;o
formed to in&s;pire that plea&s;ing la&s;&s;itude, that
divine inclination to &s;aunter, which may not
improperly be called, the luxurious indo|lence
of the country. I intend to build a
temple here to the charming godde&s;s of
lazine&s;s.</P>

<P>I Find, my dear, that ab&s;ence and amu&s;e|ment
are the be&s;t remedies for a
beginning pa&s;&s;ion; I have pa&s;&s;ed a fort|night
at the Indian village of Lorette,
where the novelty of the &s;cene, and the
enquiries I have been led to make into
their antient religion and manners, have
been of a thou&s;and times more &s;ervice to
me than all the reflection in the world
would have been.</P>
<P>I will own to you that I &s;taid too long
at Montreal, or rather at Major Mel|moth's;
to be &s;ix weeks in the &s;ame hou&s;e
with one of the mo&s;t amiable, mo&s;t plea&s;|ing
of women, was a trying &s;ituation to a
heart full of &s;en&s;ibility, and of a &s;en&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="64" REF="66">
which has been hitherto, from a vari|ety
of cau&s;es, a good deal re&s;trained. I
&s;hould have avoided the danger from the
fir&s;t, had it appeared to me what it really
was; but I thought my&s;elf &s;ecure in the
con&s;ideration of her engagements, a de|fence
however which I found grow weaker
every day.</P>
<P>But to my &s;avages: other nations talk
of liberty, they po&s;&s;e&s;s it; nothing can be
more a&s;toni&s;hing than to &s;ee a little village
of about thirty or forty families, the &s;mall
remains of the Hurons, almo&s;t exterminated
by long and continual war with the Iro|quoi&s;e,
pre&s;erve their independence in the
mid&s;t of an European colony con&s;i&s;ting of
&s;eventy thou&s;and inhabitants; yet the fact
is true of the &s;avages of Lorette; they
a&s;&s;ert and they maintain that independence
with a &s;pirit truly noble. One of our com|pany
having &s;aid &s;omething which an In|dian
under&s;tood as a &s;uppo&s;ition that they
had been <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of France, his eyes &s;truck
<PB N="65" REF="67">
fire, he &s;top'd him abruptly, contrary to
their re&s;pectful and &s;en&s;ible cu&s;tom of never
interrupting the per&s;on who &s;peaks, &startq;You
&startq;mi&s;take, brother,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;we are
&s;ubjects to no prince; a &s;avage is free
all over the world.&endq; And he &s;poke only
truth; they are not only free as a people,
but every individual is perfectly &s;o. Lord
of him&s;elf, at once &s;ubject and ma&s;ter, a
&s;avage knows no &s;uperior, a circum&s;tance
which has a &s;triking effect on his behavi|our;
unawed by rank or riches, di&s;tinctions
unknown among&s;t his own nation, he would
enter as unconcerned, would po&s;&s;e&s;s all his
powers as freely in the palace of an orien|tal
monarch, as in the cottage of the mean|e&s;t
pea&s;ant: 'tis the &s;pecies, 'tis man, 'tis
his equal he re&s;pects, without regarding the
gaudy trappings, the accidental advantages,
to which poli&s;hed nations pay homage.</P>
<P>I have taken &s;ome pains to develop their
pre&s;ent, as well as pa&s;t, religious &s;enti|ments,
becau&s;e the Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries have
<PB N="66" REF="68">
boa&s;ted &s;o much of their conver&s;ion; and
find they have rather engrafted a few of
the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple truths of Chri&s;ti|anity
on their ancient &s;uper&s;titions, than
exchanged one faith for another; they are
baptized, and even &s;ubmit to what they
them&s;elves call the <HI>yoke</HI> of confe&s;&s;ion, and
wor&s;hip according to the outward forms of
the Romi&s;h church, the drapery of which
cannot but &s;trike minds unu&s;ed to &s;plen|dor;
but their belief is very little changed,
except that the women &s;eem to pay great

and in a future &s;tate of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments,
or, to u&s;e their own phra&s;e, in <HI>a
country of &s;ouls.</HI> They reverenced the &s;pi|rits
of their departed heroes, but it does
<PB N="67" REF="69">
not appear that they paid them any religi|ous
adoration. Their morals were more
pure, their manners more &s;imple, than
tho&s;e of poli&s;hed nations, except in what
regarded the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes: the
young women before marriage were in|dulged
in great libertini&s;m, hid however
under the mo&s;t re&s;erved and decent exte|rior.
They held adultery in abhorrence,
and with the more rea&s;on as their marriages
were di&s;&s;olvible at plea&s;ure. The mi&s;&s;io|naries
are &s;aid to have found no difficulty
&s;o great in gaining them to Chri&s;tianity, as
that of per&s;uading them to marry for life:
they regarded the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of mar|riage
as contrary to the laws of nature
and rea&s;on; and a&s;&s;erted that, as the <HI>Great
Spirit</HI> formed us to be happy, it was op|po&s;ing
his will, to continue together when

in the Huron government; the chief is
cho&s;e by the matrons from among&s;t the
neare&s;t male relations, by the female line,
of him he is to &s;ucceed; and is generally
an aunt's or &s;i&s;ter's &s;on; a cu&s;tom which,
if we examine &s;trictly into the principle on
which it is founded, &s;eems a little to con|tradict
what we are told of the extreme
cha&s;tity of the married ladies.</P>
<P>The power of the chief is extremely li|mited;
he &s;eems rather to advi&s;e his people
as a father than command them as a ma&s;|ter:
yet, as his commands are always rea|&s;onable,
and for the general good, no prince
in the world is &s;o well obeyed. They have
a &s;upreme council of ancients, into which
every man enters of cour&s;e at an age fixed,
and another of a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the chief on
common occa&s;ions, the members of which
are like him elected by the matrons: I am
plea&s;ed with this la&s;t regulation, as wo|men
are, beyond all doubt, the be&s;t judges
of the merit of men; and I &s;hould be ex|tremely
<PB N="69" REF="73">
plea&s;ed to &s;ee it adopted in Eng|land:
canva&s;&s;ing for elections would then
be the mo&s;t agreeable thing in the world,
and I am &s;ure the ladies would give their
votes on much more generous principles
than we do. In the true &s;en&s;e of the word,
<HI>we</HI> are the &s;avages, who &s;o impolitely de|prive
you of the common rights of citizen|&s;hip,
and leave you no power but that of
which we cannot deprive you, the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s
power of your charms. By the way, I
don't think you are obliged in con&s;cience to
obey laws you have had no &s;hare in mak|ing;
your plea would certainly be at lea&s;t
as good as that of the Americans, about
which we every day hear &s;o much.</P>
<P>The Hurons have no po&s;itive laws; yet
being a people not numerous, with a &s;trong
&s;en&s;e of honor, and in that &s;tate of equa|lity
which gives no food to the mo&s;t tor|menting
pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and
the council of ancients having a power to
<PB N="70" REF="74">
puni&s;h atrocious crimes, which power how|ever
they very &s;eldom find occa&s;ion to u&s;e,
they live together in a tranquillity and or|der
which appears to us &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>In more numerous Indian nations, I am
told, every village has its chief and its coun|cils,
and is perfectly independent on the
re&s;t; but on great occa&s;ions &s;ummon a ge|neral
council, to which every village &s;ends
deputies.</P>
<P>Their language is at once &s;ublime and
melodious; but, having much fewer ideas,
it is impo&s;&s;ible it can be &s;o copious as tho&s;e
of Europe: the pronunciation of the men
is guttural, but that of the women ex|tremely
&s;oft and plea&s;ing; without under|&s;tanding
one word of the language, the
&s;ound of it is very agreeable to me. Their
&s;tyle even in &s;peaking French is bold and
metaphorical: and I am told is on impor|tant
occa&s;ions extremely &s;ublime. Even in
<PB N="71" REF="75">
common conver&s;ation they &s;peak in figures,
of which I have this moment an in&s;tance.
A &s;avage woman was wounded lately in de|fending
an Engli&s;h family from the drunken
rage of one of her nation. I a&s;ked her
after her wound; &startq;It is well,&endq; &s;aid &s;he;
my &s;i&s;ters at Quebec (meaning the Engli&s;h
ladies) have been kind to me; and pi|a&s;tres,
you know, are very healing.&endq;</P>
<P>They have no idea of letters, no alpha|bet,
nor is their language reducible to
rules: 'tis by painting they pre&s;erve the
memory of the only events which intere&s;t
them, or that they think worth recording,
the conque&s;ts gained over their enemies in
war.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of their paintings, I
&s;hould not omit that, though extremely
rude, they have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to
the Chine&s;e, a circum&s;tance which &s;truck
me the more, as it is not the &s;tile of nature.
Their dances al&s;o, the mo&s;t lively panto|mimes
I ever &s;aw, and e&s;pecially the dance
<PB N="72" REF="76">
of peace, exhibit variety of attitudes re|&s;embling
the figures on Chine&s;e fans; nor
have their features and complexion le&s;s
likene&s;s to the pictures we &s;ee of the Tar|tars,
as their wandering manner of life,
before they became chri&s;tians, was the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e they
were not natives of the country, and that
America was peopled later than the other
quarters of the world, I &s;hould imagine
them the de&s;cendants of Tartars; as no|thing
can be more ea&s;y than their pa&s;|&s;age
from A&s;ia, from which America is pro|bably
not divided; or, if it is, by a very
narrow channel. But I leave this to tho&s;e
who are better informed, being a &s;ubject
on which I hone&s;tly confe&s;s my ignorance.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that they retain
mo&s;t of their antient &s;uper&s;titions. I &s;hould
particularize their belief in dreams, of
which folly even repeated di&s;appointments
cannot cure them: they have al&s;o an unli|mited
<PB N="73" REF="77">
faith in their <HI>powawers,</HI> or conjurers,
of whom there is one in every Indian vil|lage,
who is at once phy&s;ician, orator, and
divine, and who is con&s;ulted as an oracle
on every occa&s;ion. As I happened to &s;mile
at the recital a &s;avage was making of a
prophetic dream, from which he a&s;&s;ured us
of the death of an Engli&s;h officer whom I
knew to be alive, &startq;You Europeans,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable peo|ple
in the world; you laugh at our be|lief
in dreams, and yet expect us to be|lieve
things a thou&s;and times more incre|dible.&endq;</P>
<P>Their general character is difficult to de|&s;cribe;
made up of contrary and even con|tradictory
qualities, they are indolent, tran|quil,
quiet, humane in peace; active, re&s;t|le&s;s,
cruel, &s;erocious in war: courteous,
attentive, ho&s;pitable, and even polite, when
kindly treated; haughty, &s;tern, vindictive,
when they are not; and their re&s;entment
is the more to be dreaded, as they hold $word$
<PB N="74" REF="78">
point of honor to di&s;&s;emble their &s;en&s;e of
an injury till they find an opportunity to
revenge it.</P>
<P>They are patient of cold and heat, of
hunger and thir&s;t, even beyond all belief
when nece&s;&s;ity requires, pa&s;&s;ing whole days,
and often three or four days together, with|out
food, in the woods, when on the watch
for an enemy, or even on their hunting par|ties;
yet indulging them&s;elves in their
fea&s;ts even to the mo&s;t brutal degree of in|temperance.
They de&s;pi&s;e death, and &s;uffer
the mo&s;t excruciating tortures not only with|out
a groan, but with an air of triumph;
&s;inging their death &s;ong, deriding their tor|mentors,
and threatening them with the
vengeance of their &s;urviving friends: yet
hold it honorable to fly before an enemy
that appears the lea&s;t &s;uperior in number
or force.</P>
<P>Deprived by their extreme ignorance,
and that indolence which nothing but their
<PB N="75" REF="79">
ardor for war can &s;urmount, of all the con|veniencies,
as well as elegant refinements
of poli&s;hed life; &s;trangers to the &s;ofter pa&s;|&s;ions,
love being with them on the &s;ame
footing as among&s;t their fellow-tenants of
the woods, their lives appear to me rather
tranquil than happy: they have fewer
cares, but they have al&s;o much fewer en|joyments,
than fall to our &s;hare. I am told,
however, that, though in&s;en&s;ible to love,
they are not without affections; are ex|tremely
awake to friend&s;hip, and pa&s;&s;ionately
fond of their children.</P>
<P>They are of a copper color, which is
rendered more unplea&s;ing by a quantity
of coar&s;e red on their cheeks; but the chil|dren,
when born, are of a pale &s;ilver white;
perhaps their indelicate cu&s;tom of grea&s;ing
their bodies, and their being &s;o much ex|po&s;ed
to the air and &s;un even from in|fancy,
may cau&s;e that total change of com|plexion,
which I know not how otherwi&s;e
to account for: their hair is black and
<PB N="76" REF="80">
&s;hining, the women's very long, parted at
the top, and combed back, tied behind,
and often twi&s;ted with a thong of leather,
which they think very ornamental: the
dre&s;s of both &s;exes is a clo&s;e jacket, reach|ing
to their knees, with &s;patterda&s;hes, all
of coar&s;e blue cloth, &s;hoes of deer-&s;kin,
embroidered with porcupine quills, and
&s;ometimes with &s;ilver &s;pangles; and a blan|ket
thrown acro&s;s their &s;houlders, and fa&s;|tened
before with a kind of bodkin, with
necklaces, and other ornaments of beads or
&s;hells.</P>
<P>They are in general tall, well made, and
agile to the la&s;t degree; have a lively ima|gination,
a &s;trong memory; and, as far as
their intere&s;ts are concerned, are very dex|trous
politicians.</P>
<P>Their addre&s;s is cold and re&s;erved; but
their treatment of &s;trangers, and the un|happy,
infinitely kind and ho&s;pitable. A
very worthy prie&s;t, with whom I am ac|quainted
<PB N="77" REF="81">
at Quebec, was &s;ome years &s;ince
&s;hipwrecked in December on the i&s;land of
Antico&s;ti: after a variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;es, not
difficult to be imagined on an i&s;land with|out
inhabitants, during the &s;everity of a
winter even colder than that of Canada;
he, with the &s;mall remains of his compa|nions
who &s;urvived &s;uch complicated di&s;tre&s;s,
early in the &s;pring, reached the main land
in their boat, and wandered to a cabbin of
&s;avages; the ancient of which, having heard
his &s;tory, bid him enter, and liberally &s;up|plied
their wants: &startq;Approach, brother,&endq;
&s;aid he; &startq;the unhappy have a right to our
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; we are men, and cannot but
feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which happen to
men;&endq; a &s;entiment which has a &s;trong
re&s;emblance to a celebrated one in a Greek
tragedy.</P>
<P>You will not expect more from me on
this &s;ubject, as my re&s;idence here has been
&s;hort, and I can only be &s;aid to catch a few
<PB N="78" REF="82">
marking features flying. I am unable to
give you a picture at full length.</P>
<P>Nothing a&s;toni&s;hes me &s;o much as to find
their manners &s;o little changed by their in|tercour&s;e
with the Europeans; they &s;eem
to have learnt nothing of us but exce&s;s in
drinking.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the village is very fine,
on an eminence, gently ri&s;ing to a thick
wood at &s;ome di&s;tance, a beautiful little
&s;erpentine river in front, on which are a
bridge, a mill, and a &s;mall ca&s;cade, at &s;uch
a di&s;tance as to be very plea&s;ing objects
from their hou&s;es; and a cultivated coun|try,
intermixed with little woods lying be|tween
them and Quebec, from which they
are di&s;tant only nine very &s;hort miles.</P>
<P>What a letter have I written! I &s;hall
quit my po&s;t of hi&s;torian to your friend
Mi&s;s Fermor; the ladies love writing much

<OPENER>To Mi&s;s RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>Sept. 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I YESTERDAY morning received a let|ter
from Major Melmoth, to introduce
to my acquaintance Sir George Clay$on,
who brought it; he wanted no other intro|duction
to me than his being dear to the
mo&s;t amiable woman breathing; in virtue
of that claim, he may command every civility,
every attention in my power. He break|fa&s;ted
with me ye&s;terday: we were two
hours alone, and had a great deal of con|ver&s;ation;
we afterwards &s;pent the day to|gether
very agreably, on a party of plea|&s;ure
in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="84">
I am going with him this afternoon to vi|&s;it
Mi&s;s Fermor, to whom he has a letter
from the divine Emily, which he is to de|liver
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He is very hand&s;ome, but not of my fa|vorite
&s;tile of beauty: extremely fair and
blooming, with fine features, light hair
and eyes; his countenance not ab&s;olutely
heavy, but inanimate, and to my ta&s;te in|&s;ipid:
finely made, not ungenteel, but with|out
that ea&s;y air of the world which I pre|fer
to the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry without it.
In &s;hort, he is what the country ladies in
England call <HI>a &s;weet pretty man.</HI> He dre&s;&s;es
well, has the fine&s;t hor&s;es and the hand|&s;ome&s;t
liveries I have &s;een in Canada. His
manner is civil but cold, his conver&s;ation
&s;en&s;ible but not &s;pirited; he &s;eems to be a
man rather to approve than to love. Will
you excu&s;e me if I &s;ay, he re&s;embles the
form my imagination paints of Prometheus's
<PB N="81" REF="85">
man of clay, before he &s;tole the cele&s;tial
fire to animate him?</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;erutinize him too &s;trictly;
perhaps I am prejudiced in my judgment
by the very high idea I had form'd of the
man whom Emily Montague could love. I
will own to you, that I thought it impo&s;&s;ible
for her to be plea&s;ed with meer beauty;
and I cannot even now change my opinion;
I &s;hall find &s;ome latent fire, &s;ome hidden
&s;park, when we are better acquainted.</P>
<P>I intend to be very intimate with him, to
endeavour to &s;ee into his very &s;oul; I am
hard to plea&s;e in a hu&s;band for my Emily;
he mu&s;t have &s;pirit, he mu&s;t have &s;en&s;ibi|lity,
or he cannot make her happy.</P>
<P>He thank'd me for my civility to Mi&s;s
Montague: do you know I thought him
impertinent? and I am not yet &s;ure he was
<PB N="82" REF="86">
not &s;o, though I &s;aw he meant to be po|lite.</P>
<P>He comes: our hor&s;es are at the door.
Adieu!</P>
<CLOSER>Yours,
<SIGNED>ED. RIVERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>We are return'd: I every hour like him
le&s;s. There were &s;everal ladies, French
and Engli&s;h, with Mi&s;s Fermor, all on the
rack to engage the Baronet's attention;
you have no notion of the effect of a title
in America. To do the ladies ju&s;tice how|ever,
he really look'd very hand&s;ome; the
ride, and the civilities he receiv'd from a
circle of pretty women, for they were well
cho&s;e, gave a glow to his complexion ex|tremely
favorable to his de&s;ire of plea&s;|ing,
<PB N="83" REF="87">
which, through all his calmne&s;s, it was
impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve; he even at|tempted
once or twice to be lively, but
fail'd: vanity it&s;elf could not in&s;pire him
with vivacity; yet vanity is certainly his
ruling pa&s;&s;ion, if &s;uch a piece of &s;till life
can be &s;aid to have any pa&s;&s;ions at all.</P>
<P>What a charm, my dear Lucy, is there
in &s;en&s;ibility! 'Tis the magnet which at|tracts
all to it&s;elf: virtue may command e&s;|teem,
under&s;tanding and talents admiration,
beauty a tran&s;ient de&s;ire; but 'tis &s;en&s;ibility
alone which can in&s;pire love.</P>
<P>Yet the tender, the &s;en&s;ible Emily Mon|tague&mdash;no,
my dear, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible: &s;he
may fancy &s;he loves him, but it is not in
nature; unle&s;s &s;he extremely mi&s;takes his
character. His <HI>approbation</HI> of her, for he
cannot feel a livelier &s;entiment, may at
pre&s;ent, when with her, rai&s;e him a little
above his natural vegetative &s;tate, but after
<PB N="84" REF="88">
marriage he will certainly &s;ink into it
again.</P>
<P>If I have the lea&s;t judgment in men, he
will be a cold, civil, inattentive hu&s;band;
a ta&s;tele&s;s, in&s;ipid, &s;ilent companion; a tran|quil,
frozen, unimpa&s;&s;ion'd lover; his in|&s;en&s;ibility
will &s;ecure her from rivals, his
vanity will give her all the drapery of
happine&s;s; her friends will congratulate her
choice; &s;he will be the envy of her own
&s;ex: without giving po&s;itive offence, he
will every moment wound, becau&s;e he is a
&s;tranger to, all the fine feelings of a heart
like hers; &s;he will &s;eek in vain the friend,
the lover, &s;he expected; yet, &s;carce know|ing
of what to complain, &s;he will accu&s;e
her&s;elf of caprice, and be a&s;toni&s;h'd to
find her&s;elf wretched with <HI>the be&s;t hu&s;band
in the world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="89">
I tremble for her happine&s;s; I know
how few of my own &s;ex are to be found
who have the lively &s;en&s;ibility of yours,
and of tho&s;e few how many wear out their
hearts by a life of gallantry and di&s;&s;ipation,
and bring only apathy and di&s;gu&s;t into mar|riage.
I know few men capable of making
her happy; but this Sir George&mdash;my
Lucy, I have not patience.</P>
<P>Did I tell you all the men here are in

<P>MY deare&s;t Bell will better imagine
than I can de&s;cribe, the plea&s;ure
it gave me to hear of her being in Cana|da;
I am impatient to &s;ee her, but as Mrs.
Melmoth comes in a fortnight to Quebec,
I know &s;he will excu&s;e my waiting to come
with her. My vi&s;it however is to Silleri; I
long to &s;ee my dear girl, to tell her a thou|&s;and
little trifles intere&s;ting only to friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>You congratulate me, my dear, on the
plea&s;ing pro&s;pect I have before me; on
my approaching marriage with a man young,
<PB N="87" REF="91">
rich, lovely, enamor'd, and of an amiable
character.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear, I am oblig'd to my uncle
for his choice; Sir George is all you have
heard; and, without doubt, loves me, as
he marries me with &s;uch an inferiority of
fortune. I am very happy certainly; how
is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>I could indeed wi&s;h my tenderne&s;s for
him more lively, but perhaps my wi&s;hes
are romantic. I prefer him to all his &s;ex,
but wi&s;h my preference was of a le&s;s lan|guid
nature; there is &s;omething in it more
like friend&s;hip than love; I &s;ee him with
plea&s;ure, but I part from him without re|gret;
yet he de&s;erves my affection, and I
can have no objection to him which is not
founded in caprice.</P>
<P>You &s;ay true; Colonel Rivers is very
amiable; he pa&s;s'd &s;ix weeks with us, yet
<PB N="88" REF="92">
we found his conver&s;ation always new; he
is the man on earth of whom one would
wi&s;h to make a friend; I think I could
already tru&s;t him with every &s;entiment of
my &s;oul; I have even more confidence in
him than in Sir George whom I love; his
manner is &s;oft, attentive, in&s;inuating, and
particularly adapted to plea&s;e women.
Without de&s;igns, without preten&s;ions; he
&s;teals upon you in the character of a friend,
becau&s;e there is not the lea&s;t appearance
of his ever being a lover: he &s;eems to take
&s;uch an intere&s;t in your happine&s;s, as gives
him a right to know your every thought.
Don't you think, my dear, the&s;e kind of
men are dangerous? Take care of your&s;elf,
my dear Bell; as to me, I am &s;ecure in my
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>Sir George is to have the plea&s;ure of
delivering this to you, and comes again in
a few days; love him for my &s;ake, though

<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>Sept. 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BELIEVE me, Jack, you are wrong;
this vagrant ta&s;te is unnatural, and
does not lead to happine&s;s; your eager
pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure defeats it&s;elf; love
gives no true delight but where the heart
is attach'd, and you do not give yours time
to &s;ix. Such is our unhappy frailty, that
the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion may wear out, and
<PB N="90" REF="94">
another &s;ucceed, but the love of change
merely as change is not in nature; where it
is a real ta&s;te, 'tis a depraved one. Boys are
incon&s;tant from vanity and affectation, old
men from decay of pa&s;&s;ion; but men, and
particularly men of &s;en&s;e, find their happi|ne&s;s
only in that lively attachment of which
it is impo&s;&s;ible for more than one to be the
object. Love is an intellectual plea&s;ure,
and even the &s;en&s;es will be weakly affected
where the heart is &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You will find this truth confirmed even
within the walls of the &s;eraglio; amid&s;t
this crowd of rival beauties, eager to
plea&s;e, one happy fair generally reigns in
the heart of the &s;ultan; the re&s;t &s;erve
only to gratify his pride and o&s;tentation,
and are regarded by him with the &s;ame
indifference as the furniture of his &s;uperb
palace, of which they may be &s;aid to make
a part.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="95">
With your e&s;tate, you &s;hould marry; I
have as many objections to the &s;tate as you

two per&s;ons at once delicate and &s;en&s;ible,
united by friend&s;hip, by ta&s;te, by a con|formity

tender inclination which alone de&s;erves the
name of love, will find happine&s;s in mar|riage,
which is in vain &s;ought in any other
kind of attachment.</P>
<P>You are &s;o happy as to have the power

Look round you for a companion, a confi|dente;

of her affection, that you engage, that

<P>TAKE care, my dear Emily, you do
not fall into the common error of &s;en|&s;ible
and delicate minds, that of refining
away your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir George is hand&s;ome as an Adonis;
you allow him to be of an amiable cha|racter;
he is rich, young, well born, and
loves you; you will have fine cloaths, fine
jewels, a fine hou&s;e, a coach and &s;ix; all
the <HI>douceurs</HI> of marriage, with an extreme
pretty fellow, who is fond of you, whom
<HI>you &s;ee with plea&s;ure, and pre&s;er to all his
&s;ex;</HI> and yet you are di&s;contented, becau&s;e
you have not for him at twenty-four the
romantic pa&s;&s;ion of fifteen, or rather that
<PB N="94" REF="98">
ideal pa&s;&s;ion which perhaps never exi&s;ted
but in imagination.</P>
<P>To be happy in this world, it is nece&s;&s;ary
not to rai&s;e one's ideas too high: if I loved
a man of Sir George's fortune half as well
as by your own account you love him, I
&s;hould not he&s;itate one moment about mar|rying;
but &s;it down contented with ea&s;e,
affluence, and an agreeable man, without
expecting to find life what it certainly is
not, a &s;tate of continual rapture. 'Tis, I
am afraid, my dear, your misfortune to
have too much &s;en&s;ibility to be happy.</P>
<P>I could moralize exceedingly well thi$
morning on the vanity of human wi&s;hes and
expectations, and the folly of hoping for
felicity in this vile &s;ublunary world: but
the &s;ubject is a little exhau&s;ted, and I have
a pa&s;&s;ion for being original. I think all the
moral writers, who have &s;et off with pro|mi&s;ing
to &s;hew us the road to happine&s;s,
have obligingly ended with telling us there
<PB N="95" REF="99">
is no &s;uch thing; a conclu&s;ion extremely
con&s;oling, and which if they had drawn be|fore
they &s;et pen to paper, would have
&s;aved both them&s;elves and their readers an
infinity of trouble. This fancy of hunting
for what one knows is not to be found, is
really an ingenious way of amu&s;ing both
one's &s;elf and the world: I wi&s;h people
would either write to &s;ome purpo&s;e, or be
&s;o good as not to write at all.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hall &s;et about writing a &s;y&s;|tem
of ethics my&s;elf, which &s;hall be &s;hort,
clear, and comprehen&s;ive; nearer the Epi|curean
perhaps than the Stoic; but rural,
refined, and &s;entimental; rural by all
means; for who does not know that virtue
is a country gentlewoman? all the good
mammas will tell you, there is no &s;uch be|ing
to be heard of in town.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly be glad to &s;ee you, my
dear; though I fore&s;ee &s;trange revolutions
<HI>in the &s;tate of Denmark</HI> from this event;
<PB N="96" REF="100">
at pre&s;ent I have all the men to my&s;elf,
and you mu&s;t know I have a prodigious
aver&s;ion to divided empire: however, 'tis
&s;ome comfort they all know you are going
to be married. You may come, Emily;
only be &s;o obliging to bring Sir George
along with you: in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
you are not &s;o very formidable.</P>
<P>The men here, as I &s;aid before, are all
dying for me; there are many hand&s;omer
women, but I flatter them, and the dear
creatures cannot re&s;i&s;t it. I am a very good
girl to women, but naturally artful (if you
will allow the expre&s;&s;ion) to the other &s;ex;
I can blu&s;h, look down, &s;tifle a &s;igh, flutter
my fan, and &s;eem &s;o agreeably confu&s;ed&mdash;
you have no notion, my dear, what fools
men are. If you had not got the &s;tart of
me, I would have had your little white-haired
baronet in a week, and yet I don't
take him to be made of very combu&s;tible
materials; rather mild, compo&s;ed, and
<PB N="97" REF="101">
pretty, I believe; but he has vanity, which
is quite enough for my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Either your love or Colonel Rivers will
have the honor to deliver this letter; 'tis
rather cruel to take them both from us at
once; however, we &s;hall &s;oon be made
amends; for we &s;hall have a torrent of
beaux with the general.</P>
<P>Don't you think the &s;un in this country
va&s;tly more chearing than in England? I
am charmed with the &s;un, to &s;ay nothing
of the moon, though to be &s;ure I never &s;aw
a moon-light night that de&s;erved the name
till I came to America.</P>
<P><HI>Mon cher pere</HI> de&s;ires a thou&s;and com|pliments;
you know he has been in love
with you ever &s;ince you were &s;even years

the clear air of Canada, and looks ten years
younger than before he &s;et out.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102">

<P>YOUR brother, my dear, is gone to
Montreal with Sir George Clayton,
of whom I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard, and
who is going to marry a friend of mine, to
pay a vi&s;it to <HI>Mon&s;ieur le General,</HI> who is
arrived there. The men in Canada, the
Engli&s;h I mean, are eternally changing
<PB N="99" REF="103">
place, even when they have not &s;o plea&s;ing
a call; travelling is cheap and amu&s;ing, the
pro&s;pects lovely, the weather inviting; and
there are no very lively plea&s;ures at pre|&s;ent
to attach them either to Quebec or
Montreal, &s;o that they divide them&s;elves
between both.</P>
<P>This fancy of the men, which is ex|tremely
the mode, makes an agreable
circulation of inamoratoes, which &s;erves to
vary the amu&s;ement of the ladies; &s;o that
upon the whole 'tis a pretty fa&s;hion, and
de&s;erves encouragement.</P>
<P>You expect too much of your brother,
my dear; the &s;ummer is charming here,
but with no &s;uch very &s;triking difference
from that of England, as to give room to
&s;ay a va&s;t deal on the &s;ubject; though I
believe, if you will plea&s;e to compare our
letters, you will find, putting us together,
we cut a pretty figure in the de&s;criptive
way; at lea&s;t if your brother tells me truth.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="104">
You may expect a very well painted fro&s;t|piece
from me in the winter; as to the
pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, it is ju&s;t like any fine au|tumn
in England: I may add, that the
beauty of the nights is much beyond my
power of de&s;cription: a con&s;tant <HI>Aurora
borealis,</HI> without a cloud in the heavens;
and a moon &s;o re&s;plendent that you may
&s;ee to read the &s;malle&s;t print by its light;
one has nothing to wi&s;h but that it was
full moon every night. Our evening walks
are delicious, e&s;pecially at Silleri, where
'tis the plea&s;ante&s;t thing in the world to li&s;|ten
to &s;oft non&s;en&s;e,
<Q>&startq;Whil&s;t the moon dances through the
trembling leaves&endq;</Q>
(A line I &s;tole from Philander and Sylvia):
But to return:</P>
<P>The French ladies never walk but at
night, which &s;hews their good ta&s;te; and
<PB N="101" REF="105">
then only within the walls of Quebec,
which does not: they &s;aunter &s;lowly, after
&s;upper, on a particular battery, which is a
kind of little Mall: they have no idea of
walking in the country, nor the lea&s;t feel|ing
of the lovely &s;cene around them; there
are many of them who never &s;aw the falls
of Montmorenci, though little more than
an hour's drive from the town. They &s;eem
born without the &s;malle&s;t portion of curio|&s;ity,
or any idea of the plea&s;ures of the
imagination, or indeed any plea&s;ure but
that of being admired; love, or rather co|quetry,
dre&s;s, and devotion, &s;eem to &s;hare
all their hours: yet, as they are lively, and
in general hand&s;ome, the men are very
ready to excu&s;e their want of knowledge.</P>
<P>There are two ladies in the province, I
am told, who read; but both of them are
above fifty, and they are regarded as pro|digies
of erudition.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="106">
Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>Ab&s;olutely, Lucy, I will marry a &s;avage,
and turn &s;quaw (a pretty &s;oft name for
an Indian prince&s;s!): never was any thing
delightful as their lives; they talk of
French husbands, but commend me to an
Indian one, who lets his wife ramble five
hundred miles, without a&s;king where &s;he is
going.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting after dinner with a book, in
a thicker of hawthorn near the beach,
when a loud laugh called my attention to
the river, where I &s;aw a canoe of &s;avages
making to the &s;hore; there were &s;ix wo|men,
and two or three children, without
one man among&s;t them: they landed, tied
the canoe to the root of a tree, and finding
out the mo&s;t agreable &s;hady &s;pot among&s;t
the bu&s;hes with which the beach was
covered, which happened to be very near
<PB N="103" REF="107">
me, made a fire, on which they laid &s;ome
fi&s;h to broil, and, fetching water from
the river, &s;at down on the gra&s;s to their
frugal repa&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;tole &s;oftly to the hou&s;e, and, ordering
a &s;ervant to bring &s;ome wine and cold pro|vi&s;ions,
returned to my &s;quaws: I a&s;ked
them in French if they were of Lorette;
they &s;hook their heads: I repeated the
que&s;tion in Engli&s;h, when the olde&s;t of the
women told me, they were not; that their
country was on the borders of New Eng|land;
that, their husbands being on a hunt|ing
party in the woods, curio&s;ity, and the
de&s;ire of &s;eeing their brethren the Engli&s;h
who had conquered Quebec, had brought
them up the great river, down which they
&s;hould return as &s;oon as they had &s;een Mon|treal.
She courteou&s;ly a&s;ked me to &s;it down,
and eat with them, which I complied with,
and produced my part of the fea&s;t. We
&s;oon became good company, and <HI>brighten'd
<PB N="104" REF="108">
the chain of friend&s;hip</HI> with two bottles of
wine, which put them into &s;uch &s;pirits,
that they danced, &s;ung, &s;hook me by the
hand, and grew &s;o very fond of me, that
I began to be afraid I &s;hould not ea&s;ily get
rid of them. They were very unwilling to
part with me; but, after two or three very
ridiculous hours, I with &s;ome difficulty pre|vailed
on the ladies to pur&s;ue their voyage,
having fir&s;t repleni&s;hed their canoe with pro|vi&s;ions
and a few bottles of wine, and given
them a letter of recommendation to your
brother, that they might be in no di&s;tre&s;s

<P>I HAVE but a moment, my dear, to ac|knowledge
your la&s;t; this week has been
a continual hurry.</P>
<P>You mi&s;take me; it is not the romantic
pa&s;&s;ion of fifteen I wi&s;h to feel, but that
tender lively friend&s;hip which alone can
<PB N="113" REF="117">
give charms to &s;o intimate an union as that
of marriage. I wi&s;h a greater conformity
in our characters, in our &s;entiments, in our
ta&s;tes.</P>
<P>But I will &s;ay no more on this &s;ubject till
I have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you at Silleri.
Mrs. Melmoth and I come in a &s;hip which
&s;ails in a day or two; they tell us, it is the
mo&s;t agreeable way of coming: Colonel
Rivers is &s;o polite, as to &s;tay to accompany
us down: Major Melmoth a&s;ked Sir George,
but he preferred the plea&s;ure of parading
into Quebec, and &s;hewing his fine hor&s;es and
fine per&s;on to advantage, to that of attending
his mi&s;tre&s;s: &s;hall I own to you that I am
hurt at this in&s;tance of his neglect, as I
know his attendance on the general was not
expected? His &s;ituation was more than a
&s;ufficient excu&s;e; it was highly improper
for two women to go to Quebec alone; it
is in &s;ome degree &s;o that any other man
&s;hould accompany me at this time: my
pride is extremely wounded. I expect a
<PB N="114" REF="118">
thou&s;and times more attention from him
&s;ince his acqui&s;ition of fortune; it is with
pain I tell you, my dear friend, he &s;eems
to &s;hew me much le&s;s. I will not de&s;cend
to &s;uppo&s;e he pre&s;umes on this increa&s;e of
fortune, but he pre&s;umes on the inclination
he &s;uppo&s;es I have for him; an inclination,
however, not violent enough to make me
&s;ubmit to the lea&s;t ill treatment from him.</P>
<P>In my pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind, I am ex|tremely
hard to plea&s;e; either his beha|viour
or my temper have &s;uffered a change.
I know not how it is, but I &s;ee his faults in a
much &s;tronger light than I have ever &s;een
them before. I am alarmed at the coldne&s;s of
his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o ill &s;uited to the &s;en&s;ibi|lity

where liberty appears, not as here among

<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>Sept. 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT you &s;ay, my dear friend, is
more true than I wi&s;h it was; our
Engli&s;h women of character are generally
too re&s;erved; their manner is cold and for|bidding;
they &s;eem to think it a crime to
be too attractive; they appear almo&s;t afraid
to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis to this ill-judged re&s;erve I attribute
the low pro&s;ligacy of too many of our young
men; the grave faces and di&s;tant beha|viour
<PB N="118" REF="122">
of the generality of virtuous women
fright them from their acquaintance, and
drive them into the &s;ociety of tho&s;e wretched
votaries of vice, who&s;e conver&s;ation de|ba&s;es
every &s;entiment of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>With as much beauty, good &s;en&s;e, &s;en|&s;ibility,
and &s;oftne&s;s, at lea&s;t, as any wo|men
on earth, no women plea&s;e &s;o little as
the Engli&s;h: depending on their native
charms, and on tho&s;e really amiable quali|ties
which envy cannot deny them, they are
too carele&s;s in acquiring tho&s;e enchanting
namele&s;s graces, which no language can de|fine,
which give re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force to beauty,
and even &s;upply its place where it is want|ing.</P>
<P>They are &s;atisfied with being good,
without con&s;idering that unadorned vir|tue
may command e&s;teem, but will never
excite love; and both are nece&s;&s;ary in mar|riage,
which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the &s;tate
every woman of honor has in pro&s;pect; for
<PB N="119" REF="123">
I own my&s;elf rather incredulous as to the
a&s;&s;ertions of maiden aunts and cou&s;ins to
the contrary. I wi&s;h my amiable country-women
would con&s;ider one moment, that vir|tue
is never &s;o lovely as when dre&s;&s;ed in
&s;miles: the virtue of women &s;hould have
all the &s;oftne&s;s of the &s;ex; it &s;hould be gen|tle,
it &s;hould be even playful, to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a lady here, whom I wi&s;h you
to &s;ee, as the &s;horte&s;t way of explaining to
you all I mean; &s;he is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing wo|man
I ever beheld, independently of her
being one of the hand&s;ome&s;t; her manner
is irre&s;i&s;tible: &s;he has all the &s;miling graces
of France, all the blu&s;hing delicacy and
native &s;oftne&s;s of England.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more delicate, my dear
Temple, than the manner in which you
offer me your e&s;tate in Rutland, by way of
anticipating your intended legacy: it is
however impo&s;&s;ible for me to accept it; my
father, who &s;aw me naturally more profu&s;e
<PB N="120" REF="124">
than became my expectations, took &s;uch
pains to counterwork it by in&s;piring me
with the love of independence, that I can|not
have &s;uch an obligation even to you.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, your legacy is left on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that you are not to marry, and I
am ab&s;olutely determined you &s;hall; &s;o that,
by accepting this mark of your e&s;teem, I
&s;hould be robbing your younger children.</P>
<P>I have not a wi&s;h to be richer whil&s;t I
am a batchelor, and the only woman I ever
wi&s;hed to marry, the only one my heart
de&s;ires, will be in three weeks the wife of
another; I &s;hall &s;pend le&s;s than my income
here: &s;hall I not then be rich? To make
you ea&s;y, know I have four thou&s;and
pounds in the &s;unds; and that, from the
equality of living here, an en&s;ign is obliged
to &s;pend near as much as I am; he is inevi|tably
ruined, but I &s;ave money.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="125">
I pity you, my friend; I am hurt to
hear you talk of happine&s;s in the life you
at pre&s;ent lead; of finding plea&s;ure in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
venal beauty; you are in danger of
acquiring a habit which will vitiate your
ta&s;te, and exclude you from that &s;tate of
refined and tender friend&s;hip for which na|ture
formed a heart like yours, and which is
only to be found in marriage: I need not
add, in a marriage of choice.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that love marriages are
generally unhappy; nothing is more fal&s;e;
marriages of meer inclination will always
be &s;o: pa&s;&s;ion alone being concerned, when
that is gratified, all tenderne&s;s cea&s;es of
cour&s;e: but love, the gay child of &s;ympa|thy
and e&s;teem, is, when attended by de|licacy,
the only happine&s;s worth a rea&s;on|able
man's pur&s;uit, and the choice&s;t gift of
heaven: it is a &s;ofter, tenderer friend&s;hip,
enlivened by ta&s;te, and by the mo&s;t ardent
<PB N="122" REF="126">
de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which time, in&s;tead of
de&s;troying, will render every hour more
dear and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>If, as you po&s;&s;ibly will, you &s;hould call
me romantic, hear a man of plea&s;ure on
the &s;ubject, the Petronius of the la&s;t age,
the elegant, but voluptuous St. Evremond,
who &s;peaks in the following manner of the
friend&s;hip between married per&s;ons:</P>
<P>&startq;I believe it is this plea&s;ing intercour&s;e
of tenderne&s;s, this reciprocation of e&s;|teem,
or, if you will, this mutual ardor
of preventing each other in every en|dearing
mark of affection, in which con|&s;i&s;ts
the &s;weetne&s;s of this &s;econd &s;pecies
of friend&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I do not &s;peak of other plea&s;ures,
which are not &s;o much in them&s;elves as
in the a&s;&s;urance they give of the intire
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e we love: this appears
<PB N="123" REF="127">
to me &s;o true, that I am not afraid to
a&s;&s;ert, the man who is by any other
means certainly a&s;&s;ured of the tender|ne&s;s
of her he loves, may ea&s;ily &s;up|port
the privation of tho&s;e plea&s;ures;
and that they ought not to enter into
the account of friend&s;hip, but as proofs
that it is without re&s;erve.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis true, few men are capable of the
purity of the&s;e &s;entiments, and 'tis for
that rea&s;on we &s;o very &s;eldom &s;ee per|fect
friend&s;hip in marriage, at lea&s;t for
any long time: the object which a &s;en|&s;ual
pa&s;&s;ion has in view cannot long &s;u&s;|tain
a commerce &s;o noble as that of
friend&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>You &s;ee, the plea&s;ures you &s;o much boa&s;t
are the lea&s;t of tho&s;e which true tender|ne&s;s
has to give, and this in the opinion of
a voluptuary.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="128">
My dear Temple, all you have ever
known of love is nothing to that &s;weet con|&s;ent
of &s;ouls in uni&s;on, that harmony of
minds congenial to each other, of which
you have not yet an idea.</P>
<P>You have &s;een beauty, and it has in&s;pired
a momentary emotion, but you have never
yet had a real attachment; you yet know
nothing of that irre&s;i&s;tible tenderne&s;s, that
delirium of the &s;oul, which, whil&s;t it re|fines,
adds &s;trength to pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I perhaps &s;ay too much, but I wi&s;h with
ardor to &s;ee you happy; in which there is
the more merit, as I have not the lea&s;t
pro&s;pect of being &s;o my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to pur&s;ue the plan of life
which I my&s;elf think mo&s;t likely to bring
nappine&s;s, becau&s;e I know our &s;ouls to
be of the &s;ame frame: we have taken dif|ferent
<PB N="125" REF="129">
roads, but you will come back to
mine. Awake to delicate plea&s;ures, I
have no ta&s;te for any other; there are no
other for &s;en&s;ible minds. My gallantries
have been few, rather (if it is allowed to
&s;peak thus of one's &s;elf even to a friend)
from elegance of ta&s;te than &s;everity of
manners; I have loved &s;eldom, becau&s;e I
cannot love without e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Believe me, Jack, the meer plea&s;ure of
loving, even without a return, is &s;uperior to
all the joys of &s;en&s;e where the heart is un|touched:
the French poet does not exag|gerate
when he &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;Amour;</L>
<L>Tous les autres plai&s;irs ne valent pas tes peines.</L></Q></P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Sept. 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been rambling about among&s;t
the pea&s;ants, and a&s;king them a thou|&s;and
que&s;tions, in order to &s;atisfy your in|qui&s;itive
friend. As to my father, though,
properly &s;peaking, your que&s;tions are ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to him, yet, being upon duty, he
begs that, for this time, you will accept of
an an&s;wer from me.</P>
<P>The Canadians live a good deal like
the ancient patriarchs; the lands were ori|ginally
&s;ettled by the troops, every officer
became a &s;eigneur, or lord of the manor,
every &s;oldier took lands under his com|mander;
but, as avarice is natural to man|kind,
the &s;oldiers took a great deal more
than they could cultivate, by way of pro|viding
<PB N="127" REF="131">
for a family: which is the rea&s;on &s;o
much land is now wa&s;te in the fine&s;t part
of the province: tho&s;e who had children,
and in general they have a great number,
portioned out their lands among&s;t them as
they married, and lived in the mid&s;t of a
little world of their de&s;cendents.</P>
<P>There are whole villages, and there is
even a large i&s;land, that of Coudre, where
the inhabitants are all the de&s;cendents of
one pair, if we only &s;uppo&s;e that their
&s;ons went to the next village for wives, for
I find no tradition of their having had a di&s;|pen&s;ation
to marry their &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The corn here is very good, though not
equal to ours; the harve&s;t not half &s;o gay
as in England, and for this rea&s;on, that
the lazy creatures leave the greate&s;t part of
their land uncultivated, only &s;owing as
much corn of different &s;orts as will &s;erve
them&s;elves; and being too proud and too
idle to work for hire, every family gets in
<PB N="128" REF="132">
its own harve&s;t, which prevents all that jo|vial
&s;pirit which we find when the reapers
work together in large parties.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s is the reigning pa&s;&s;ion here, from
the pea&s;ant to his lord; the gentlemen
never either ride on hor&s;eback or walk, but
are driven about like women, for they never
drive them&s;elves, lolling at their ea&s;e in a
calache: the pea&s;ants, I mean the ma&s;ters
of families, are pretty near as u&s;ele&s;s as
their lords.</P>
<P>You will &s;carce believe me, when I tell
you, that I have &s;een, at the farm next us,
two children, a very beautiful boy and
girl, of about eleven years old, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
their grandmother, reaping a field of oats,
whil&s;t the lazy father, a &s;trong fellow of
thirty two, lay on the gra&s;s, &s;moaking his
pipe, about twenty yards from them: the
old people and children work here; tho&s;e
in the age of &s;trength and health only take
their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="133">
<HI>A propos</HI> to &s;moaking, 'tis common to &s;ee
here boys of three years old, &s;itting at their
doors, &s;moaking their pipes, as grave and
compo&s;ed as little old Chine&s;e men on a
chimney.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me after our fruits: we have,
as I am told, an immen&s;ity of cranberries
all the year; when the &s;now melts away
in &s;pring, they are &s;aid to be found under
it as fre&s;h and as good as in autumn: &s;traw|berries
and rasberries grow wild in profu|&s;ion;
you cannot walk a &s;tep in the fields
without treading on the former: great
plenty of currants, plumbs, apples, and
pears; a few cherries and grapes, but not
in much perfection: excellent mu&s;k me|lons,
and water melons in abundance, but
not &s;o good in proportion as the mu&s;k.
Not a peach, nor any thing of the kind;
this I am however convinced is le&s;s the fault
of the climate than of the people, who
<PB N="130" REF="134">
are too indolent to take pains for any thing
more than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their
exi&s;tence. They might have any fruit here
but goo&s;eberries, for which the &s;ummer is
too hot; there are bu&s;hes in the woods,
and &s;ome have been brought from England,
but the fruit falls off before it is ripe. The
wild fruits here, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the
bramble kind, are in much greater variety
and perfection than in England.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of the natural productions
of the country, I &s;hould not forget that
hemp and hops grow every where in the
woods; I &s;hould imagine the former might
be cultivated here with great &s;ucce&s;s, if the
people could be per&s;uaded to cultivate any
thing.</P>
<P>A little corn of every kind, a little hay,
a little tobacco, half a dozen apple trees,
a few onions and cabbages, make the whole
of a Canadian plantation. There is &s;carce
a &s;lower, except tho&s;e in the woods, where
<PB N="131" REF="135">
there is a variety of the mo&s;t beautiful
&s;hrubs I ever &s;aw; the wild cherry, of which
the woods are full, is equally charming in
flower and in fruit; and, in my opinion, at
lea&s;t equals the arbutus.</P>
<P>They &s;ow their wheat in &s;pring, never
manure the ground, and plough it in the
&s;lighte&s;t manner; can it then be wondered
at that it is inferior to ours? They fancy the
fro&s;t would de&s;troy it if &s;own in autumn;
but this is all prejudice, as experience has
&s;hewn. I my&s;elf &s;aw a field of wheat this
year at the governor's farm, which was
manured and &s;own in autumn, as fine as I
ever &s;aw in England.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you, they are &s;o indolent as
never to manure their lands, or even their
gardens; and that, till the Engli&s;h came, all
the manure of Quebec was thrown into the
river.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">
You will judge how naturally rich
the &s;oil mu&s;t be, to produce good crops
without manure, and without ever lying
fallow, and almo&s;t without ploughing; yet
our political writers in England never &s;peak
of Canada without the epithet of <HI>barren.</HI>
They tell me this extreme fertility is owing
to the &s;now, which lies five or &s;ix months
on the ground. Provi&s;ions are dear, which
is owing to the prodigious number of hor&s;es
kept here; every family having a carriage,
even the poore&s;t pea&s;ant; and every &s;on of
that pea&s;ant keeping a hor&s;e for his little
excur&s;ions of plea&s;ure, be&s;ides tho&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary
for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farm. The war
al&s;o de&s;troyed the breed of cattle, which I
am told however begins to encrea&s;e; they
have even &s;o far improved in corn, as to
export &s;ome this year to Italy and Spain.</P>
<P>Don't you think I am become an excel|lent
farmere&s;s? 'Tis intuition; &s;ome people
are born learned: are you not all a&s;toni&s;h|ment
<PB N="133" REF="137">
at my knowledge? I never was &s;o vain
of a letter in my life.</P>
<P>Shall I own the truth? I had mo&s;t of my
intelligence from old John, who lived long
with my grandfather in the country; and
who, having little el&s;e to do here, has taken
&s;ome pains to pick up a competent know|ledge

give her a coach and &s;ix; but I can give her,
what is more conducive to happine&s;s, a
heart which knows how to value her per|fections.</P>
<P>I never had &s;o plea&s;ing a journey; we

made it a continual party of plea&s;ure, took
mu&s;ic with us, landed once or twice a day,
vi&s;ited the French families we knew, lay
both nights on &s;hore, and danced at the
&s;eigneur's of the village.</P>

This river, from Montreal to Quebec,
exhibits a &s;cene perhaps not to be matched
in the world: it is &s;ettled on both &s;ides,
though the &s;ettlements are not &s;o numerous
on the &s;outh &s;hore as on the other: the
lovely confu&s;ion of woods, mountains, mea|dows,
corn fields, rivers (for there are &s;everal

St. Lawrence), intermixed with churches
and hou&s;es breaking upon you at a di&s;tance
through the trees, form a variety of land|&s;capes,
to which it is difficult to do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This charming &s;cene, with a clear &s;erene
&s;ky, a gentle breeze in our favor, and the
conver&s;ation of half a dozen fine women,
would have made the voyage plea&s;ing to the

too of the party, and mo&s;t politely atten|tive

up till &s;he is actually married.</P>
<P>I re&s;pect her engagements, and pretend to
no more from her than her friend&s;hip; but,
as to my&s;elf, will love her in whatever manner
I plea&s;e: to &s;hew you my prudence, how|ever,
I intend to dance with the hand&s;ome&s;t
unmarried Frenchwoman here on Thur&s;|day,

<P>AN enchanting ball, my dear; your lit|tle

more admired than Emily, which to be &s;ure
did not flatter my vanity at all: I &s;ee &s;he

e&s;tate. I will think further of it: there is
nothing more ea&s;y than to have him if I
chu&s;e it: 'tis only &s;aying to &s;ome of his

<P>MY vi&s;it to you is prevented by an

him, if nece&s;&s;ary, by degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="158">
What an e&s;cape have I had! I was within
four and twenty hours of either determin|ing
to marry a man with whom I fear I
have little chance to be happy, or of
breaking with him in a manner that would
have &s;ubjected one or both of us to the cen|&s;ures
of a prying impertinent world, who&s;e
cen&s;ures the mo&s;t &s;teady temper cannot
always contemn.</P>
<P>I will own to you, my dear, I every
hour have more dread of this marriage:
his pre&s;ent &s;ituation has brought his faults
into full light. Captain Clayton, with lit|tle
more than his commi&s;&s;ion, was mode&s;t,
humble, affable to his inferiors, polite to
all the world; and I $ancied him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of tho&s;e more active virtues, which I &s;up|po&s;ed
the &s;mallne&s;s of his fortune prevented
from appearing. 'Tis with pain I &s;ee that
Sir George, with a &s;plendid income, is ava|ricious,
&s;elfi&s;h, proud, vain, and profu&s;e;
lavi&s;h to every caprice of vanity and o&s;ten|tation
<PB N="155" REF="159">
which regards him&s;elf, coldly inat|tentive
to the real wants of others.</P>
<P>Is this a character to make your Emily
happy? We were not formed for each
other: no two minds were ever &s;o different;
my happine&s;s is in friend&s;hip, in the tender
affections, in the &s;weets of dear dome&s;tic
life; his in the idle parade of affluence, in
dre&s;s, in equipage, in all that &s;plendor, which,
whil&s;t it excites envy, is too often the mark
of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Shall I &s;ay more? Marriage is &s;eldom
happy where there is a great di&s;proportion
of fortune. The lover, after he lo&s;es that
endearing character in the hu&s;band, which
in common minds I am afraid is not long,
begins to reflect how many more thou&s;ands
he might have expected; and perhaps &s;u&s;|pects
his mi&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e intere&s;ted motives
in marrying, of which he now feels his own
heart capable. Coldne&s;s, &s;u&s;picion, and
<PB N="156" REF="160">
mutual want of e&s;teem and confidence, fol|low
of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I will come back with you to Silleri this

<P>I am certain I could not exi&s;t a year

<PB N="162" REF="166">
of &s;olitude to which one is confined in a

hou&s;e, nay the fir&s;t Indian fire of which I
&s;aw the &s;moke ri&s;e above the trees, gave me
the mo&s;t lively tran&s;port that can be con|ceived;
I felt all the force of tho&s;e ties
which unite us to each other, of that &s;o|cial
love to which we owe all our happi|ne&s;s
here.</P>
<P>But to my hermit: his appearance di&s;|armed
my di&s;like; he is a tall old man,
with white hair and beard, the look of
one who has known better days, and the
&s;tronge&s;t marks of benevolence in his
countenance. He received me with the ut|mo&s;t
ho&s;pitality, &s;pread all his little &s;tores
of fruit before me, fetched me fre&s;h milk,
and water from a &s;pring near his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="167">
After a little conver&s;ation, I expre&s;&s;ed
my a&s;toni&s;hment, that a man of who&s;e kind|ne&s;s
and humanity I had ju&s;t had &s;uch
proof, could find his happine&s;s in flying
mankind: I &s;aid a good deal on the &s;ub|ject,
to which he li&s;tened with the polite&s;t
attention.</P>
<P>&startq;You appear,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;of a temper
to pity the mi&s;eries of others. My &s;tory
is &s;hort and &s;imple: I loved the mo&s;t
amiable of women; I was beloved. The
avarice of our parents, who both had
more gainful views for us, prevented an
union on which our happine&s;s depended.
My Loui&s;a, who was threatened with an
immediate marriage with a man &s;he de|te&s;ted,
propo&s;ed to me to &s;ly the tyranny
of our friends: &s;he had an uncle at
Quebec, to whom &s;he was dear. The
wilds of Canada, &s;aid &s;he, may afford
us that refuge our cruel country denies
<PB N="164" REF="168">
us. After a &s;ecret marriage, we embarked.
Our voyage was thus far happy; I landed
on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, to &s;eek refre&s;h|ments
for my Loui&s;a; I was returning,
plea&s;ed with the thought of obliging the
object of all my tenderne&s;s, when a be|ginning
&s;torm drove me to &s;eek &s;helter in
this bay. The &s;torm encrea&s;ed, I &s;aw it's
progre&s;s with agonies not to be de&s;cribed;
the &s;hip, which was in &s;ight, was unable
to re&s;i&s;t its fury; the &s;ailors crowded
into the boat; they had the humanity to
place my Loui&s;a there; they made for
the &s;pot where I was, my eyes were
wildly fixed on them; I &s;tood eagerly on
the utmo&s;t verge of the water, my arms
&s;tretched out to receive her, my prayers
ardently addre&s;&s;ed to Heaven, when an
immen&s;e wave broke over the boat; I
heard a general &s;hriek; I even fancied I
di&s;tingui&s;hed my Loui&s;a's cries; it &s;ub|&s;ided,
the &s;ailors again exerted all their
force; a &s;econd wave&mdash;I &s;aw them no
more.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="169">
&startq;Never will that dreadful &s;cene be ab|&s;ent
one moment from my memory: I
fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the beach; when I re|turned
to life, the fir&s;t object I beheld
was the breathle&s;s body of my Loui&s;a
at my feet. Heaven gave me the wretched
con&s;olation of rendering to her the la&s;t
&s;ad duties. In that grave all my happi|ne&s;s
lies buried. I knelt by her, and
breathed a vow to Heaven, to wait here
the moment that &s;hould join me to all I
held dear. I every morning vi&s;it her
loved remains, and implore the God of
mercy to ha&s;ten my di&s;&s;olution. I feel
that we &s;hall not long be &s;eparated;
I &s;hall &s;oon meet her, to part no more.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topped, and, without &s;eeming to
remember he was not alone, walked ha&s;tily
towards a little oratory he has built on the
beach, near which is the grave of his
Loui&s;a; I followed him a few &s;teps, I &s;aw
<PB N="166" REF="170">
him throw him&s;elf on his knees; and, re|&s;pecting
his &s;orrow, returned to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Though I cannot ab&s;olutely approve,
yet I more than forgive, I almo&s;t ad|mire,
his renouncing the world in his &s;itua|tion.
Devotion is perhaps the only balm for
the wounds given by unhappy love; the
heart is too much &s;oftened by true tender|ne&s;s
to admit any common cure.</P>
<P>Seven in the evening.</P>
<P>I am returned to Madame Des Roches and
her friends, who declined vi&s;iting the her|mit.

is like an over-dre&s;&s;ed, tawdry, rich citi|zen's

like an elegant well-dre&s;&s;ed woman of

Horace, who is my favorite author). There
is a noble, graceful &s;implicity both in the

<P>I AM this moment arrived from a ramble
down the river; but, a &s;hip being ju&s;t
going, mu&s;t acknowledge your la&s;t.</P>
<P>You make me happy in telling me my
dear Lady H&mdash;&mdash;has given my place in her
heart to &s;o hone&s;t a fellow as Jack Will|mott;
and I &s;incerely wi&s;h the ladies al|ways
cho&s;e their favorites as well.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very unrea&s;onable indeed to
expect con&s;tancy at almo&s;t four thou&s;and
mil$s di&s;tance, e&s;pecially when the pro|&s;pect
of my return is &s;o very uncertain.</P>
<P>My voyage ought undoubtedly to be
con&s;idered as an abdication: I am to all in|tents
<PB N="175" REF="179">
and purpo&s;es dead in law as a lover;
and the lady has a right to con&s;ider her heart
as vacant, and to proceed to a new election.</P>
<P>I claim no more than a &s;hare in her e&s;|teem
and remembrance, which I dare &s;ay
I &s;hall never want.</P>
<P>That I have amu&s;ed my&s;elf a little in
the dowager way, I am very far from de|nying;
but you will ob&s;erve, it was le&s;$,
from ta&s;te than the principle of doing as
little mi&s;chief as po&s;&s;ible in my few excur|&s;ions
to the world of gallantry. A little
deviation from the exact rule of right we
men all allow our&s;elves in love a$$airs; but
I was willing to keep as near it as I could.
Married women are, on my principles, f$$|bidden
fruit; I abhor the &s;eduction of in|nocence;
I am too delicate, and (with all
my mode&s;ty) too vain, to be plea&s;ed with
venal beauty: what was I then to do, with
a heart too active to be ab&s;olutely at re&s;t,
<PB N="176" REF="180">
and which had not met with it's counter|part?
Widows were, I thought, fair prey,
as being &s;ufficiently experienced to take care
of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid married women are, on my
principles, forbidden fruit: I &s;hould have
explained my&s;elf; I mean in England, for
my ideas on this head change as &s;oon as I
$word$ at Cal$is.</P>
<P>Such is the amazing force of local pre|judice,
that I do not recollect having ever
made love to an Engli&s;h married woman, or
a French unmarried one. Marriages in
France being made by the parents, and
therefore generally without inclination on
either &s;ide, gallantry &s;eems to be a tacit
condition, though not ab&s;olutely expre&s;&s;ed
in the contract.</P>
<P>But to return to my plan: I think it an
excellent one; and would recommend it to all
tho&s;e young men about town, who, like me,
<PB N="177" REF="181">
find in their hearts the nece&s;&s;ity of loving,
before they meet with an object capable of
fixing them for life.</P>
<P>By the way, I think the widows ought
to rai&s;e a &s;tatue to my honor, for having
done my <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to prove that, for the &s;ake
of decorum, morals, and order, they ought
to have all the men to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have this moment your letter from
Rutland. Do you know I am almo&s;t angry?
Your ideas of love are narrow and pedan|tic;
cu&s;tom has done enough to make the
life of one half of our &s;pecies ta&s;tele&s;s;
but you would reduce them to a &s;tate of
&s;till greater in&s;ipidity than even that to
which our tyranny has doomed them.</P>
<P>You would limit the plea&s;ure of loving
and being beloved, and the charming power
of plea&s;ing, to three or four years only in
the life of that &s;ex which is peculiarly
formed to $eel tenderne&s;s; women are born
<PB N="178" REF="182">
with more lively affections than men, which
are &s;till more &s;oftened by education; to deny
them the privilege of being amiable, the
only privilege we allow them, as long as
nature continues them &s;o, is &s;uch a mixture
of cruelty and fal&s;e ta&s;te as I &s;hould never
have &s;u&s;pected you of, notwith&s;tanding your
partiality for unripened beauty.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I per&s;i&s;t in my opinion,
that women are mo&s;t charming when they
join the attractions of the mind to tho&s;e
of the per&s;on, when they feel the pa&s;&s;ion
they in&s;pire; or rather, that they are ne|ver
charming till then.</P>
<P>A woman in the fir&s;t bloom of youth re|&s;embles
a tree in blo&s;&s;om; when mature, in
fruit: but a woman who retains the charms
of her per&s;on till her under&s;tanding is in
its full perfection, is like tho&s;e trees in
happier climes, which produce blo&s;&s;oms and
fruit together.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="183">

well as I love you my&s;elf, I have a thou|&s;and

he knows not the perfections which
adorn the valuable part of your &s;ex, he is
a &s;tranger to your virtues, and incapable,
at lea&s;t I fear &s;o, of that tender affection
which alone can make an amiable woman
happy. With all this, he is polite and at|tentive,

intending it, is calculated to deceive women
into an opinion of his being attached when
he is not: he has all the &s;plendid virtues
which command e&s;teem; is noble, gene|rous,
di&s;intere&s;ted, open, brave; and is the

<P>Do not however mi&s;take me, my Lucy;
I know him to be as incapable of forming
improper de&s;igns on you, even were you
not the &s;i&s;ter of his friend, as you are of
li&s;tening to him if he did: 'tis for your
heart alone I am alarmed; he is formed to

<P>I have &s;een my divine Emily: her man|ner
of receiving me was very flattering; I
cannot doubt her friend&s;hip for me; yet I

I would fain hope&mdash;yet what have I to
hope? If I had even the happine&s;s to be
agreable to her, if &s;he was di&s;engaged from
Sir George, my fortune makes it impo&s;&s;ible

to indigence at home, or dooming her to
be an exile in Canada for life. I dare not

<P>I DANCED la&s;t night till four o'clock in
the morning (if you will allow the ex|pre&s;&s;ion),
without being the lea&s;t fatigued:
the little Fitzgerald was my partner, who
grows upon me extremely; the monkey
has a way of being attentive and carele&s;s
by turns, which has an amazing effect; no|thing
attaches a woman of my temper &s;o
much to a lover as her being a little in fear
of lo&s;ing him; and he keeps up the &s;pirit
of the thing admirably.</P>
<P>Your brother and Emily danced together,
and I think I never &s;aw either of them look
&s;o hand&s;ome; &s;he was a thou&s;and times

really a charming fellow, he is an immen&s;e
favorite with the ladies; he has that very
plea&s;ing general attention, which never fails
to charm women; he can even be particu|lar
to one, without wounding the vanity of
the re&s;t: if he was in company with twenty,
his mi&s;ter&s;s of the number, his manner
would be &s;uch, that every woman there
would think her&s;elf the &s;econd in his e&s;teem;
and that, if his heart had not been unluckily
pre-engaged, &s;he her&s;elf &s;hould have been
the object of his tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>His eyes are of immen&s;e u&s;e to him; he
looks the civile&s;t things imaginable, his
whole coun$$$ance &s;peaks whatever he
wi&s;hes to &s;ay; he has the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for

<P>Fitzgerald has eyes too, I a&s;&s;ure you, and
eyes that know how to &s;peak; he has a

which is really irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>

the open carriole is a kind of one-hor&s;e

their appearance prodigiou&s;ly; the covered
carrioles &s;eem the prettie&s;t things in nature

<P>I HAVE a thou&s;and rea&s;ons, my deare&s;t

I have the &s;incere&s;t e&s;teem for Sir George,
and am not in&s;en&s;ible of the force of our
engagements; but do not think his being
there a rea&s;on for my coming: the kind of
&s;u&s;pended &s;tate, to &s;ay no more, in which
tho&s;e engagements now are, call for a de|licacy
in my behaviour to him, which is
&s;o difficult to ob&s;erve without the appear|ance

me for a very painful kind of re|&s;traint:
for the &s;ame rea&s;on, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible

I do come, even though Mi&s;s Fermor &s;hould

A moment's reflexion will convince you
of the propriety of my &s;taying here till
his mother does me the honor again to ap|prove
his choice; or till our engagement is
publicly known to be at an end. Mrs.
Clayton is a prudent mother, and a woman

George's &s;ituation is changed &s;ince &s;he con|&s;ented

<P>I am not capricious; but I will own to
you, that my e&s;teem for Sir George is much
le&s;&s;ened by his behaviour &s;ince his la&s;t re|turn
from New-York: he mi&s;takes me ex|tremely,
if he &s;uppo&s;es he has the lea&s;t
additional merit in my eyes from his late
acqui&s;ition of fortune: on the contrary, I
now &s;ee faults in him which were concealed
by the mediocrity of his &s;ituation before,

<P>We &s;weep into the general's a&s;&s;embly

your little Bell &s;its down with &s;uch a &s;aucy

for being &s;o much more agreable than
them&s;elves, which is a fault I for my part
am not in the lea&s;t inclined to be a&s;hamed
of.</P>
<P>Your idea of Quebec, my dear, is per|fectly

little &s;ociety; cards, &s;candal, dancing, and

<P>I ENTREAT you, my deare&s;t Madam,
to do me the ju&s;tice to believe I &s;ee
my engagement to Sir George in as &s;trong
a light as you can do; if there is any
change in my behaviour to him, it is owing
to the very apparent one in his conduct to
me, of which no one but my&s;elf can be a
judge. As to what you &s;ay in regard to
my contempt of affluence, I can only &s;ay
it is in my character, whether it is gene|rally
in the female one or not.</P>
<P>Were the cruel hint you are plea&s;ed to
give ju&s;t, be a&s;&s;ured Sir George &s;hould be
the fir&s;t per&s;on to whom I would declare it.
I hope however it is po&s;&s;ible to e&s;teem
<PB N="211" REF="215">
merit without offending even the mo&s;t &s;a|cred
of all engagements.</P>
<P>A gentleman waits for this. I have only
time to &s;ay, that Mi&s;s Fermor thanks you
for your obliging invitation, and promi&s;es
&s;he will accompany me to Montreal as &s;oon
as the river St. Lawrence will bear car|riages,
as the upper road is extremely in|convenient.</P>

<P>AFTER a fortnight's &s;now, we have
had near as much clear blue &s;ky
and &s;un&s;hine: the &s;now is &s;ix feet deep, &s;o
that we may be &s;aid to walk on our own
heads; that is, &s;peaking <HI>en philo&s;ophe,</HI> we
occupy the &s;pace we &s;hould have done in
&s;ummer if we had done &s;o; or, to explain
it more clearly, our heels are now where
our heads &s;hould be.</P>
<P>The &s;cene is a little changed for the
wor&s;e: the lovely land&s;cape is now one un|di&s;tingui&s;hed wa&s;te of &s;now, only a little
diver&s;ified by the great variety of ever|greens
in the woods: the romantic winding
path down the &s;ide of the hill to our farm,
on which we u&s;ed to amu&s;e our&s;elves with
<PB N="213" REF="217">
&s;eeing the beaux &s;erpentize, is now a con|fu&s;ed,
frightful, rugged precipice, which
one trembles at the idea of a&s;cending.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exceedingly agrea|ble
in the whirl of the carrioles, which
fly along at the rate of twenty miles an
hour; and really hurry one out of one's
&s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Our little coterie is the object of great
envy; we live ju&s;t as we like, without
thinking of other people, which I am not
&s;ure <HI>here</HI> is prudent, but it is plea&s;ant,
which is a better thing.</P>
<P>Emily, who is the civile&s;t creature
breathing, is for giving up her own plea|&s;ure
to avoid offending others, and wants
me, every time we make a carrioling-party,
to invite all the mi&s;&s;es of Quebec to go
with us, becau&s;e they &s;eem angry at our
being happy without them: but for that
<PB N="214" REF="218">
very rea&s;on I per&s;i&s;t in my own way, and
con&s;ider wi&s;ely, that, though civility is due
to other people, yet there is al&s;o &s;ome ci|vility
due to one's &s;elf.</P>
<P>I agree to vi&s;it every body, but think it
mighty ab&s;urd I mu&s;t not take a ride with|out
a&s;king a hundred people I &s;carce know
to go with me: yet this is the &s;tyle here;
they will neither be happy them&s;elves, nor
let any body el&s;e. Adieu!</P>

<P>I will never take a beaver's word again
as long as I live: there is no &s;upporting
this cold; the Canadians &s;ay it is &s;eventeen
years &s;ince there has been &s;o &s;evere a &s;ea|&s;on.
I thought beavers had been people
of more honor.</P>
<P>Adieu! I can no more: the ink freezes
as I take it from the &s;tandi&s;h to the paper,
though clo&s;e to a large &s;tove. Don't ex|pect

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Jan. 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with difficulty I breathe, my dear;
the cold is &s;o amazingly inten&s;e as al|mo&s;t
totally to &s;top re&s;piration. I have
bu&s;ine&s;s, the bu&s;ine&s;s of plea&s;ure, at Que|bec;
but have not courage to &s;tir from the
&s;tove.</P>
<P>We have had five days, the &s;everity of
which none of the natives remember to
<PB N="216" REF="220">
have ever &s;een equaled: 'tis &s;aid, the cold
is beyond all the thermometers here, tho'
intended for the climate.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t wine freezes in a room
which has a &s;tove in it; even brandy is
thickened to the con&s;i&s;tence of oil: the
large&s;t wood fire, in a wide chimney, does
not throw out it's heat a quarter of a yard.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t venture to Quebec to-morrow, or
have company at home: amu&s;ements are
here nece&s;&s;ary to life; we mu&s;t be jovial,
or the blood will freeze in our veins.</P>
<P>I no longer wonder the elegant arts are
unknown here; the rigour of the climate
&s;u&s;pends the very powers of the under&s;tand|ing;
what then mu&s;t become of tho&s;e of
the imagination? Tho&s;e who expect to &s;ee
<Q>&startq;A new Athens ri&s;ing near the pole,&endq;</Q>
<PB N="217" REF="221">
will find them&s;elves extremely di&s;appoint|ed.
Genius will never mount high, where
the faculties of the mind are benumbed
half the year.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficient employment for the mo&s;t
lively &s;pirit here to contrive how to pre|&s;erve
an exi&s;tence, of which there are mo|ments
that one is hardly con&s;cious: the
cold really &s;ometimes brings on a &s;ort of
&s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>We had a million of beaux here ye&s;ter|day,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere cold: 'tis
the Canadian cu&s;tom, calculated I &s;uppo&s;e
for the climate, to vi&s;it all the ladies on
New-year's-day, who &s;it dre&s;&s;ed in form
to be ki&s;&s;ed: I a&s;&s;ure you, however, our
ki&s;&s;es could not warm them; but we were
obliged, to our eternal di&s;grace, to call in
ra$berry brandy as an auxiliary.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="222">
You would have died to &s;ee the men;
they look ju&s;t like &s;o many bears in their
open carrioles, all wrapped in furs from
head to foot; you &s;ee nothing of the hu|man
form appear, but the tip of a no&s;e.</P>
<P>They have intire coats of beaver &s;kin,
exactly like Friday's in Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe,
and ca&s;ques on their heads like the old
knights errant in romance; you never &s;aw
&s;uch tremendous figures; but without this
kind of cloathing it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
&s;tir out at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The ladies are equally covered up, tho'
in a le&s;s unbecoming &s;tyle; they have long
cloth cloaks with loo&s;e hoods, like tho&s;e
worn by the market-women in the north
of England. I have one in &s;carlet, the
hood lined with &s;able, the prettie&s;t ever
&s;een here, in which I a&s;&s;ure you I look
amazingly hand&s;ome; the men think &s;o,
<PB N="219" REF="223">
and call me the <HI>Little red riding-hood;</HI> a
name which becomes me as well as the
hood.</P>
<P>The Canadian ladies wear the&s;e cloaks
in India &s;ilk in &s;ummer, which, fluttering in
the wind, look really graceful on a fine
woman.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides our riding-hoods, when we go
out, we have a large buffaloe's &s;kin under
our feet, which turns up, and wraps round
us almo&s;t to our &s;houlders; &s;o that, upon
the whole, we are pretty well guarded from
the weather as well as the men.</P>
<P>Our covered carrioles too have not only
canvas windows (we dare not have gla&s;s,
becau&s;e we often overturn), but cloth cur|tains
to draw all round us; the extreme
&s;wi$tne&s;s of the&s;e carriages al&s;o, which dart
along like lightening, helps to keep one warm,
by promoting the circulation of the blood.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="224">
I pity the Fitz; no tiger was ever &s;o
hard-hearted as I am this weather: the
little god has taken his flight, like the &s;wal|lows.
I &s;ay nothing, but cruelty is no
virtue in Canada; at lea&s;t at this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Pygmalion's &s;tatue was &s;ome
frozen Canadian gentlewoman, and a &s;ud|den
warm day thawed her. I love to ex|pound
ancient fables, and I think no expo|&s;ition
can be more natural than this.</P>
<P>Would you know what makes me chat|ter
&s;o this morning? Papa has made me
take &s;ome excellent <HI>liqueur;</HI> 'tis the mode
here; all the Canadian ladies take a little,
which makes them &s;o coquet and agreable.
Certainly brandy makes a woman talk like
an angel. Adieu!</P>

<P>I DON'T quite agree with you, my
dear; your brother does not appear
to me to have the lea&s;t &s;cruple of that
fooli&s;h fal&s;e mode&s;ty which &s;tands in a
man's way.</P>
<P>He is extremely what the French call
<HI>awakened;</HI> he is mode&s;t, certainly; that is,
he is not a coxcomb, but he has all that
proper &s;elf-confidence which is nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;et his agreable qualities in full light: no|thing
can be a &s;tronger proof of this, than
that, wherever he is, he always takes your
attention in a moment, and this without
&s;eeming to &s;olicit it.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="226">
I am very fond of him, though he never
makes love to me, in which circum&s;tance he
is very &s;ingular: our friend&s;hip is quite
platonic, at lea&s;t on his &s;ide, for I am not
quite &s;o &s;ure on the other. I remember
one day in &s;ummer we were walking <HI>t&eacute;te &agrave;
t&ecirc;te</HI> in the road to Cape Rouge, when he
wanted me to &s;trike into a very beautiful
thicket: &startq;Po&s;itively, Rivers,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;I
will not venture with you into that
wood.&endq; &startq;Are you afraid of <HI>me,</HI> Bell?&endq;
&startq;No, but extremely of <HI>my&s;elf.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>I have loved him ever &s;ince a little &s;cene
that pa&s;&s;ed here three or four months ago:
a very affecting &s;tory, of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family
in our neighbourhood, was told him and
Sir George; the latter pre&s;erved all the
philo&s;ophic dignity and manly compo&s;ure
of his countenance, very coldly expre&s;&s;ed
his concern, and called another &s;ubject:
your brother changed color, his eyes gli&s;|tened;
<PB N="223" REF="227">
he took the fir&s;t opportunity to leave
the room, he &s;ought the&s;e poor people, he
found, he relieved them; which we di&s;co|vered
by accident a month after.</P>
<P>The weather, tho' cold beyond all that
you in England can form an idea of, is yet
mild to what it has been the la&s;t five or &s;ix
days; we are going to Quebec, to church.</P>
<P>Two o'clock.</P>
<P>Emily and I have been talking religion
all the way home: we are both mighty
good girls, as girls go in the&s;e degenerate
days; our grandmothers to be &s;ure&mdash;but
it's folly to look back.</P>
<P>We have been &s;aying, Lucy, that 'tis
the &s;trange&s;t thing in the world people
&s;hould quarrel about religion, &s;ince we un|doubtedly
all mean the &s;ame thing; all
good minds in every religion aim at plea&s;|ing
the Supreme Being; the means we take
<PB N="224" REF="228">
differ according to the country where we
are born, and the prejudices we imbibe
from education; a con&s;ideration which
ought to in&s;pire us with kindne&s;s and in|dulgence
to each other.</P>
<P>If we examine each other's &s;entiments
with candor, we &s;hall find much le&s;s differ|ence
in e&s;&s;entials than we imagine;
<Q><L>&startq;Since all agree to own, at lea&s;t to mean,</L>
<L>One great, one good, one general Lord of all.&endq;</L></Q>
There is, I think, a very pretty Sunday
reflexion for you, Lucy.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, I am extremely religious;
and for this among&s;t other rea&s;ons, that I
think infidelity a vice peculiarly contrary
to the native &s;oftne&s;s of woman: it is bold,
daring, ma&s;culine; and I &s;hould almo&s;t
doubt the &s;ex of an unbeliever in petti|coats.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="229">
Women are religious as they are virtu|ous,
le&s;s from principles founded on rea|&s;oning
and argument, than from elegance
of mind, delicacy of moral ta&s;te, and a
certain quick perception of the beautiful
and becoming in every thing.</P>
<P>This in&s;tinct, however, for &s;uch it is, is
worth all the tedious rea&s;onings of the men;
which is a point I flatter my&s;elf you will
not di&s;pute with me.</P>
<P>Monday, <DATE>Jan. 5.</DATE></P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t day I have ventured in an
open carriole; we have been running a
race on the &s;now, your brother and I again&s;t
Emily and Fitzgerald: we conquered from
Fitzgerald's complai&s;ance to Emily. I &s;hall
like it mightily, well wrapt up: I &s;et off
with a crape over my face to keep off the
cold, but in three minutes it was a cake
<PB N="226" REF="230">
of &s;olid ice, from my breath which froze
upon it; yet this is called a mild day, and
the &s;un &s;hines in all his glory.</P>
<P>Silleri, Thur&s;day, <DATE>Jan. 8,</DATE> midnight.</P>
<P>We are ju&s;t come from the general's
a&s;&s;embly; much company, and we danced
till this minute; for I believe we have not
been more coming the&s;e four miles.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald is the very pink of courte&s;y;
he never u&s;es his covered carriole him&s;elf,
but devotes it intirely to the ladies; it
&s;tands at the general's door in waiting on
Thur&s;days: if any lady comes out before
her carriole arrives, the &s;ervants call out
mechanically, &startq;Captain Fitzgerald's car|riole
here, for a lady.&endq; The Colonel is
equally gallant, but I generally lay an em|bargo
on his: they have each of them an
extreme pretty one for them&s;elves, or to
drive a fair lady a morning's airing, when
<PB N="227" REF="231">
&s;he will allow them the honor, and the

<P>YOU mi&s;take me extremely, Jack, as
you generally do: I have by no
means for&s;worn marriage: on the contrary,
though happine&s;s is not &s;o often found
there as I wi&s;h it was, yet I am convinced
it is to be found no where el&s;e; and, poor
as I am, I &s;hould not he&s;itate about trying
the experiment my&s;elf to-morrow, if I
<PB N="228" REF="232">
could meet with a woman to my ta&s;te, unap|propriated,
who&s;e ideas of the &s;tate agreed
with mine, which I allow are &s;omething
out of the common road: but I mu&s;t be
certain tho&s;e ideas are her own, therefore
they mu&s;t ari&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and not in
complai&s;ance to mine; for which rea&s;on, if
I could, I would endeavour to lead my mi&s;|tre&s;s
into the &s;ubject, and know her &s;enti|ments
on the manner of living in that &s;tate
before I di&s;covered my own.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o be well convinced of her ten|derne&s;s
before I make a declaration of mine:
&s;he mu&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h me becau&s;e I flatter
her, but becau&s;e &s;he thinks I have merit;
tho&s;e fancied pa&s;&s;ions, where gratified vanity
a&s;&s;umes the form of love, will not &s;atisfy
my heart: the eyes, the air, the voice of
the woman I love, a thou&s;and little indi&s;|cretions
dear to the heart, mu&s;t convince
me I am beloved, before I confe&s;s I love.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="233">
Though &s;en&s;ible of the advantages of
fortune, I can be happy without it: if I
&s;hould ever be rich enough to live in the
world, no one will enjoy it with greater
gu&s;t; if not, I can with great &s;pirit, pro|vided
I find &s;uch a companion as I wi&s;h,
retire from it to love, content, and a cot|tage:
by which I mean to the life of a
little country gentleman.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me my opinion of the winter
here. If you can bear a degree of cold,
of which Europeans can form no idea, it
is far from being unplea&s;ant; we have &s;et|tled
fro&s;t, and an eternal blue &s;ky. Tra|velling
in this country in winter is particu|larly
agreable: the carriages are ea&s;y, and
go on the ice with an amazing velocity,
though drawn only by one hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The continual plain of &s;now would be
extremely fatiguing both to the eye and
imagination, were not both relieved, not
<PB N="230" REF="234">
only by the woods in pro&s;pect, but by the
tall branches of pines with which the road
is marked out on each &s;ide, and which
form a verdant avenue agreably contra&s;ted
with the dazzling whitene&s;s of the &s;now, on
which, when the &s;un &s;hines, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
to look &s;teadily even for a moment.</P>
<P>Were it not for this method of marking
out the roads, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
find the way from one village to another.</P>
<P>The eternal &s;amene&s;s however of this
avenue is tire&s;ome when you go far in one
road.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t two months in the
mo&s;t agreable manner po&s;&s;ible, in a little
&s;ociety of per&s;ons I extremely love: I feel
my&s;elf &s;o attached to this little circle of
friends, that I have no plea&s;ure in any other
company, and think all the time ab&s;olutely
lo&s;t that politene&s;s forces me to &s;pend any
<PB N="231" REF="235">
where el&s;e. I extremely dread our party's

an opportunity of di&s;covering &s;o clearly
before. He &s;eemed charmed beyond words
to &s;ee us all &s;o happy: we &s;taid till four
o'clock in the morning, yet all complained
to-day we came away too &s;oon.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="239">
I need not tell you we had fiddles, for
there is no entertainment in Canada without
them: never was &s;uch a race of dancers.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>The dear man is come, and with an equi|page
which puts the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia's
tranieau to &s;hame. America never beheld
any thing &s;o brilliant:
<Q><L>&startq;All other carrioles, at &s;ight of this,</L>
<L>Hide their dimini&s;h'd heads.&endq;</L></Q>
Your brother's and Fitzgerald's will never
dare to appear now; they &s;ink into no|thing.</P>
<P>Seven in the evening.</P>
<P>Emily has been in tears in her chamber;
'tis a letter of Mrs. Melmoth's which has
had this agreable effect; &s;ome wi&s;e advice,
I &s;uppo&s;e. Lord! how I hate people that
give advice! don't you, Lucy?</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="240">
I don't like this lover's coming; he is al|mo&s;t
as bad as a hu&s;band: I am afraid he
will derange our little coterie; and we have
been &s;o happy, I can't bear it.</P>
<CLOSER>Good night, my dear.
Yours,

<HEAD>LETTER LIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mi&s;s RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Jan. 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have pa&s;&s;ed a mighty &s;tupid day;
Sir George is civil, attentive, and
dull; Emily pen&s;ive, thoughtful, and &s;ilent;
and my little &s;elf as peevi&s;h as an old maid:
nobody comes near us, not even your bro|ther,
becau&s;e we are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;et|tling
<PB N="237" REF="241">
preliminaries; for you mu&s;t know Sir
George has graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to
change his mind, and will marry her, if &s;he
plea&s;es, without waiting for his mother's
letter, which re&s;olution he has communi|cated
to twenty people at Quebec in his
way hither; he is really extremely oblig|ing.
I &s;uppo&s;e the Melmoths have &s;pirited
him up to this.</P>
<P>One o'clock.</P>
<P>Emily is &s;trangely re&s;erved to me; &s;he
avoids &s;eeing me alone, and when it hap|pens
talks of the weather; papa is how|ever
in her confidence: he is as &s;trong an
advocate for this milky baronet as Mrs. Mel|moth.</P>
<P>Ten at night.</P>
<P>All is over, Lucy; that is to &s;ay, all is
fixed: they are to be married on Monday
next at the Recollects church, and to &s;et
off immediately for Montreal: my father
<PB N="238" REF="242">
has been telling me the whole plan of ope|rations:
we go up with them, &s;tay a fort|night,
then all come down, and &s;how away
till &s;ummer, when the happy pair embark
in the fir&s;t &s;hip for England.</P>
<P>Emily is really what one would call a
prudent pretty &s;ort of woman, I did not
think it had been in her: &s;he is certainly
right, there is danger in delay; &s;he has a
thou&s;and proverbs on her &s;ide; I thought
what all her fine &s;entiments would come
to; &s;he &s;hould at lea&s;t have waited for mam|ma's
con&s;ent; this hurry is not quite con|&s;i&s;tent
with that extreme delicacy on which
&s;he piques her&s;elf; it looks exceedingly as
if &s;he was afraid of lo&s;ing him.</P>
<P>I don't love her half &s;o well as I did three
days ago; I hate di&s;crect young ladies that
marry and &s;ettle; give me an agreable
fellow and a knap&s;ack.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="243">
My poor Rivers! what will become of
him when we are gone? he has neglected
every body for us.</P>
<P>As &s;he loves the plea&s;ures of conver&s;ation,
&s;he will be amazingly happy in her choice;
<Q>&startq;With &s;uch a companion to &s;pend the
long day!&endq;</Q>
He is to be &s;ure a mo&s;t entertaining
creature.</P>
<P>Adieu! I have no patience.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours,
<SIGNED>A. FERMOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>After all, I am a little droll; I am angry
with Emily for concluding an advantageous
match with a man &s;he does not ab&s;olutely
di&s;like, which all good mammas &s;ay is &s;uffi|cient;
and this only becau&s;e it breaks in on
a little circle of friends, in who&s;e &s;ociety I
have been happy. O! &s;elf! &s;elf! I would
<PB N="240" REF="244">
have her hazard lo&s;ing a fine fortune and a
coach and &s;ix, that I may continue my co|terie
two or three months longer.</P>
<P>Adieu! I will write again as &s;oon as we
are married. My next will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be
from Montreal. I die to &s;ee your brother
and my little Fitzgerald; this man gives me
the vapours. Heavens! Lucy, what a
difference there is in men!</P>
