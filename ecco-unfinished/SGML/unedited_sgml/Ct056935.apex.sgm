<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE World has been pleas'd to Mannage me &s;o &s;everely of late, that if ever I pre&s;ume to Vi&s;it them in Print again, I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time make a tedious Apology, and &s;o de&s;cen&punc;d to what I have always had an Aver&s;ion to, I mean the Impertinence of a long Preface.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, that when by a Man's Writing 'tis plain enough what he Means, yet a poor Author &s;hould be forc'd to trouble the World with a long Account of what he does not mean too.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Times, he that writes any thing which may be mi&s;under&s;tood <HI>Ought to expect to be Mi&s;un|der&s;tood,</HI> and ought to give People leave to believe he meant ill, tho' the Error is in their own Eye-&s;ight, and the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e he that knew the Defect of Cu&s;tom, ought to have fenc'd again&s;t it: As when a Man talks &s;oftly to a Deaf Man, he ought to expect the Man &s;hould think he Cur&s;es when he Complements, and that if he Smiles at a Story, he Laughs at him he tells it to, and he cannot flame the Man neither, becau&s;e he might have &s;poke plainer.</P>
<P>This is the Ca&s;e with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters, who are of the Opinion, That a certain Book, which, <HI>'tis too true for me was of my Writing,</HI> was writ with a De&s;ign to have all the Di&s;&s;enters Hang'd, Bani&s;h'd or De&s;troy'd, and that the Gallows, and the Gal|lies, &s;hould be the Penalty of Going to a Conventicle, forgetting that the &s;ame time I mu&s;t de&s;ign to have my Father, my Wife, &s;ix innocent Children, and my &s;elf, put into the &s;ame Condition.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
All the Fault I can find in my &s;elf as to the&s;e People is, that when I had drawn the Picture I did not like the <HI>Dutch</HI>-man, with his Man and Bear write under them, <HI>This is the Man,</HI> and <HI>This is the Bear,</HI> le&s;t the People &s;hould mi&s;take me.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I did not fore&s;ee an Occa&s;ion for this, and having in a Compliment to their Judgments &s;hun'd &s;o &s;harp a Reflection upon their Sen&s;es. I have left them at Liberty, to Treat me like One that put a Value upon their Penetration at the Expence of my own.</P>
<P>I have no Occa&s;ion further to mention that unhappy Book than on the&s;e Accounts; for, 'tis plain, all other Parties under&s;tand it, and take it as it was meant, and I am like to find it &s;o.</P>
<P>The Liberty the World has taken with my Character, in this time of my Retreat, has been the Occa&s;ion of this Book.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, that when a Man under the Publick Re&s;entment was oblidg'd to keep out of the way, the whole World &s;hould fly at him, like a Dog with a Broom at his Tail, reckon up all the Faults of his Life, and Ten Thou&s;and more than ever he Committed, to be the common Places of their general Di&s;cour&s;e, taking the Advan|tage of his Ab&s;ence, when he was not able to An&s;wer for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o Extravagant was the whole World, that One had Wit little enough, as well as Manners, to Challenge me in Print, when he knew, at the &s;ame time, there was a Reward of Fifty Pounds to be given to him that would Di&s;cover where I was.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch a Satyr upon all the re&s;t, that really in&s;tead of Figh|ting that Gentleman I would Thank him, if I knew who he was, as a Per&s;on that was willing to &s;how him&s;elf a Coxcomb, that other People might &s;ee their own Pictures.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is particularly famous for the mo&s;t Generous way of Figh|ting in the World, I mean as to the common Peoples private Quar|rels, while the <HI>Dutch</HI> mangle one another with Knives, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Highlanders knock one another's Brains out with Pole-Axes, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;tab with their Skeins, and <HI>Spaniards</HI> with their Daggers; the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>-men fairly Box it out, and in this way of Fighting the Rabble &s;tands by to &s;ee fair Play, as they call it, which is, that when a
<PB REF="5">
Man is down 'tis Counted foul Play, and the Trick of a Coward, to &s;trike him, but let him Ri&s;e, and then have-at-him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it had been but kind to have given me fair play, and not fall all upon me when I was down; let me get up again, <HI>if I can, for I much doubt it,</HI> and then let us &s;ee who&s;e Face is blacke&s;t, and welcome.</P>
<P>In this Univer&s;al humour of Mobbing me, &s;ome Gentlemen have de&s;cended very much beneath their own Characters, as well as Ho|ne&s;ty, to the Di&s;grace of Good Manners, and the &s;candal of their Edu|cation. If I was not really very angry with them, I &s;hould give them &s;ome room in this Book, but I &s;corn to make a Satyr the Method of &s;howing my private Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>If I would $re&s;ent all the &s;coundrel U&s;age I have met with, and &s;ome of it from my Friends, I mu&s;t certainly prepair <HI>to dye with my Shooes on,</HI> and therefore I choo&s;e to let it pa&s;s, as that which is really more &s;hame to the Author of Scandal than to me.</P>
<P>But that the World may &s;ee I am not one of tho&s;e that Practice what I reprove, I began this Satyr, with Owing, in my &s;elf, tho&s;e Sins and Misfortunes which I am no more exempted from than other Men, and as I am far from pretending to be free from Humane frail|ties, but forwarder to confe&s;s any of the Errors of my Life, than any Man can be to Accu&s;e me. I think my &s;elf in a better way to Re|formation, than tho&s;e who excu&s;e their own Faults by reckoning up Mine.</P>
<P>Some that have heard me complain of this hard u&s;age have told me, there is &s;omething of a Retaliation of Providence in it, for my being &s;o very free with the Characters of other Men, in a late Satyr call'd, <HI>The Reformation of Manners.</HI></P>
<P>To this I An&s;wer,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in that Satyr, or any other I ever wrote, I have always carefully avoided la&s;hing any Man's private Infirmities, as being too &s;en&s;ible of my Own. But if I have &s;ingl'd out any Men by Characters, it has either been &s;uch as pretending to reform others, and Execute the Laws again&s;t Vice, have been the great Examples and Encouragers of it in their own Example and Practice.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Or &s;uch as have been Tru&s;ted with the Executive Power of Ju&s;tice, and having been call'd upon by the Laws to Reform us, have been a publick reproach to the Magi&s;tracy of this Nation, and ought to be puni&s;h'd by the Laws they have been Protected by.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I have never made any Man's Di&s;a&s;ters and Misfortunes the Subject of my Satyr.</P>
<P>I never Reproach'd any Man for having his Hou&s;e burnt, or his Ships ca&s;t away, or his Family ruin'd; I never Lampoon'd a Man becau&s;e he could not pay his Debts, or for his being a Cuckold.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I never Reproach'd any Man for his Opinion in Religion, or us'd him the wor&s;e for differing in Judgment from me.</P>
<P>Indeed, if I meet with a profe&s;s'd Athei&s;t, that after God has gi|ven him Life and a Being, denies to own the Being of Him that made him. If I meet with a Clergy-man that points the way to Heaven to other People, but tells them 'tis not worth while for him to go that way him&s;elf, a Fellow that Preaches becau&s;e he's paid for it, and bids his Hearers <HI>get them to Heaven and be Damn'd to 'em,</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;es I think I have no Bounds &s;et me.</P>
<P>If therefore the &s;candalous Treatment I have receiv'd is ju&s;t upon me for abu&s;ing others, I mu&s;t ask &s;uch, Who is the Man? Where is the Character I have given that is not Ju&s;t? And where's the Re|taliation of Providence that the&s;e Men entitle them&s;elves to in load|ing me with Fal&s;ities and Lies, as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for my &s;aying the Truth?</P>
<P>But a PO-x on him, <HI>&s;aid a certain &s;ober Gentleman, that did not u&s;e to have &s;uch Words in his Mouth,</HI> he is a <HI>Whig,</HI> and what need he have meddl'd with his own Party? Could not he have left them out, there were Characters enough o' tother &s;ide.</P>
<P>Why really, Gentlemen, I mu&s;t own I know to Whig or Tory in Vice. The Vitious and the Vertuons are the only two Parties I had to do with. If a Vitious, Leud, Debauch'd Magi&s;trate happen'd to be a Whig, what then? Let him mend his Manners, and he may be a Whig &s;till, and if not, the re&s;t ought to be a&s;ham'd of him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if they will have me be of that Party, I think I ought rather to have fix't on my own Party than not, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That no Man might &s;ay I was Partial and Unfair, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That tho&s;e I had
<PB REF="7">
mo&s;t kindne&s;s for might reform fir&s;t, which is the be&s;t thing I could wi&s;h for them.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, if the&s;e are my Faults, <HI>you have paid me home for them;</HI> and now 'tis my turn again, but I &s;hall treat you with &s;ome different Candor from what I receiv'd.</P>
<P>I do own that I &s;hall never &s;ee a notorious &s;candalous Magi&s;trate, a whoreing drunken Clergy-man, a leud debauch'd Ju&s;tice of the Peace, a publick bla&s;phemeing Athei&s;t, but I &s;hall be apt to have a fling at him my way; but you have done me this good, that I &s;hall always be a publick Penitent for my own Mi&s;carriages, if it be only in meer Pride not to be liable to your Recrimination.</P>
<P>And I recommend my Practice to all my Friends, if they would be Satyr free,</P>
<LG>
<L>Confe&s;&s;ion will anticipate Reproach,</L>
<L>He that Reviles us then Reviles too much.</L>
<L>All Satyr cea&s;es when the Men Repent,</L>
<L>'Tis Cruelty to la&s;h the Penitent.</L>
</LG>
<P>And yet, Gentlemen, I de&s;ire not to be mi&s;taken, for as I will never hide my Infirmities, &s;o I am not oblidg'd to confe&s;s Sins I never committed; and therefore &s;peaking to the Vitious, with whom I have been &s;o free, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I was not in their debt this Acknow|ledgement; for tho' I have been a Man of Misfortunes, and one of the greate&s;t has been to be wrong fully accus'd, yet I have the comfort of this Negative, if Negative Vertues can be any Comfort, That I have not been a Man of Vice, and whatever Malice may have the ill Nature to &s;ugge&s;t, I venture to &s;ay without Pride, no Man can charge me with it.</P>
<P>I forbear to &s;ay any thing farther than Thankfulne&s;s to re&s;training Goodne&s;s extorts, for I count a Man no proper Advocate for him&s;elf. But if I mu&s;t act the', Phari&s;ee a little, I mu&s;t begin thus; <HI>God, I thank thee,</HI> I am not a Drunkard, or a Swearer, or a Whore-ma&s;ter, or a bu&s;y Body, or Idle, or Revengeful, &amp;c. and tho' this be true, and I chal|lenge all the World to prove the contrary, yet I mu&s;t own I &s;ee &s;mall &s;atisfaction in all the po&s;&s;ible Negatives of Common Vertue. For tho' I
<PB REF="8" MS="Y">
have not been Guilty of any of the&s;e Vices, nor of many more, I have nothing to infer from thence, but, <HI>Te Deum Laudamus.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, how can it be true that I have been too free with the Characters, when here are a &s;ort of People almo&s;t ready to go to|gether by the Ears about the Characters; if there be a Drunken Ju|&s;tice, all Men are fond of being thought the Man, the Lawyers have named me Twenty Men for my <HI>Clitus,</HI> and a$undance more for <HI>Fletumacy,</HI> and if I have &s;ingl'd out but one of a Sort, where is the Injury to any Body? &s;ince if they who are nam'd don't like it, bere is &s;o many People are fond of taking it up in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>However, it &s;eems to be a Di&s;paragement to the Satyr to want &s;o direct a Hint at the Per&s;on nam'd, as if the Character was not a &s;ufficient D$&s;cription of the Party, and this argued a Deficency of Wit in the performance.</P>
<P>In order therefore, to plea&s;e every Body, if that impo&s;&s;ible thing be likely, I have plac'd the few Characters in this Book without any true References, declaring before hand, that the Letters &s;ignifie no Body, and the Con&s;equences of this are two.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If any Per&s;on has rea&s;on to think he is the Man pointed out in any Particular, he is at Liberty to di&s;own the Character, and by his future Reformation to &s;how that it could not be he.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho&s;e that are fond of a rank Character, need not fall out who was meant by the Author; but as many as find their Likene&s;s in the Picture may call it their own, and fill up the Blanks with their Names if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>They who expect I &s;hould &s;ay any thing of my own Matters relating to <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way,</HI> will be mi&s;taken, this is no part of the De&s;ign, nor hath the Book any thing to do with it. So far as that Book has Di&s;pleas'd the Government, I have &s;urrendred at Di&s;cretion, and having voluntarily committed my &s;elf to the Publick Clemency, have no more to &s;ay but this, <HI>It is the Queen, let Her Maje&s;ty do what &s;eems Good in Her Eyes.</HI></P>
