<HEAD>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
CONTINUATION
OF THE
MEMOIRS
OF
MISS SIDNEY BIDULPH.</HEAD>
<P>THE editor of the former part of the&s;e memoirs
having been extremely &s;ollicited by many people,
to procure, if po&s;&s;ible, a further account of Mrs. Ar|nold
and her family, would gladly have gratified the
curio&s;ity of his readers, if after having left &s;o melan|choly
an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the tender and
humane, he could, in the &s;ucceeding part of the hi|&s;tory,
have thrown in &s;ome rays of &s;un&s;hine, to
brighten the pro&s;pect, before he dropped the curtain over
&s;o gloomy a &s;cene; but as that &s;atisfaction is not per|mitted
him, the only reflection that could enable him
to pur&s;ue with any alacrity the thread of this affecting
&s;tory, was, that the principal per&s;on concerned in
it, is long &s;ince at peace, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
rewards which were denied to her virtue and her &s;uf|ferings
here.</P>
<P>The gentleman by who&s;e means I was favoured with
the fir&s;t part of this hi&s;tory, told me upon my re-urging
<PB N="2" REF="4">
my enquiries after &s;ome farther lights into it, that as all
the events which occurred even after the clo&s;e of his
mother's narrative had happened when he was in his
early infancy, he could give me very little information
about them: he only knew in general that &s;ome very
di&s;tre&s;sful incidents had &s;ucceeded in Mrs. Arnold's life
after that period: he added that his mother never cared
to &s;peak on the &s;ubject, which had prevented his a&s;king
her any particulars; but that he recollected to have
heard her &s;ay, that &s;he believed Patty Main, the young
woman who formerly waited on Mrs. Arnold, was in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome papers which contained the whole
&s;tory. I a&s;ked him if this gentlewoman were &s;till liv|ing,
and where &s;he was to be found; he told me &s;he
had married a gentleman of the name of A&s;kham, who
had an e&s;tate in Oxford&s;hire: but whether &s;he, or any
of her family, were now in being he could not inform
me.</P>
<P>Upon &s;o &s;lender a hope as this of recovering the
remainder of &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;tory, I took a journey
into Oxford&s;hire; where I &s;oon learnt that Mrs. A&s;kham
and her hu&s;band had both been dead many years; but
that they had left three daughters, among&s;t whom (as
they had no &s;on) their father's e&s;tate of about &s;ix
hundred pounds a year, had been equally divided.
The two elde&s;t were &s;ettled in a different part of the
country; but the younge&s;t who was her mother's fa|vourite,
having married unhappily a man who &s;quan|dered
her little fortune was now a widow, and re&s;iding
in the city of Oxford. The per&s;ons from I had this
account, added, that &s;he kept a haberda&s;her's &s;hop, and
as &s;he had two or three children, they believed &s;he was
in &s;treightened circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>To this per&s;on therefore I applied, and ea&s;ily intro|duced
my&s;elf by buying &s;ome of the goods in which
&s;he dealt. I found her a mode&s;t &s;en&s;ible woman, who
&s;eemed with great indu&s;try to apply her&s;elf to a little
calling for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of her family; at the &s;ame
&s;ame time I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover that her education had
qualified her to appear in a much better &s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
After I had, by two or three vi&s;its, made my&s;elf a
little acquainted with her, I took occa&s;ion one day to
a&s;k her, whether &s;he had ever heard her mother talk of
Mrs. Arnold? She &s;eemed &s;tartled at the que&s;tion: Be
nor alarm'd Madam, &s;aid I, at my enquiry, the part
that Mrs A&s;kham bore in the hi&s;tory of that unfortu|nate
lady will always do honour to her memory. I am
&s;urprized, Sir, replied &s;he, how Mrs. Arnold's &s;tory
came to be publi&s;hed; for tho' the names are all changed,
I was too well acquainted with the characters of every
per&s;on concerned in it, not to know for whom they
were intended. I then told her without re&s;erve that I
my&s;elf had been the editor, and the means by which I
had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the manu&s;cript; acquainting her
at the &s;ame time that I had learnt from the &s;on of Mrs.
Cecilia B&mdash;that Mrs. A&s;kham had had &s;ome papers
containing very intere&s;ting particulars; and that if they
&s;till remained in the family, I &s;hould look upon it as a
&s;ingular favour if &s;he would procure me a fight of them.
She told me &s;he had them her&s;elf; but that as &s;he &s;hould
be very unwilling to part with them, &s;he hoped I would
excu&s;e her not giving them out of her hands; but that
to oblige me I &s;hould be very welcome to peru&s;e them
at her hou&s;e, which &s;he &s;aid I could do in two or
three mornings, if I would take the trouble to call.</P>
<P>I thanked her for this permi&s;&s;ion, and accordingly
waited on her the next morning; when I found her
bu&s;ied in ranging the papers in order on a table in her
dining-room. Here, Sir, &s;aid &s;he on my entering, you
will find your curio&s;ity fully gratified. The&s;e are
copies of letters which pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;everal per|&s;ons
concerned in the &s;tory they contain: they are all
in my mother's hand-writing, who as &s;he was in Mrs.
Arnold's confidence to her la&s;t hour, wrote them out
with the permi&s;&s;ion of the family, in order, as &s;he has
often told me, to pre&s;erve from oblivion the memory
of &s;o many uncommon events crowded into one life,
and to leave the whole as a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to her children.
I was the child &s;he mo&s;t loved, and &s;he left the&s;e papers
to me at her death. You will find in this parcel, con|tinued
&s;he (pointing to a large packet which lay by
<PB N="4" REF="6">
it&s;elf) the former part of Mrs. Arnold's hi&s;tory, carried
down to that period at which &s;he retired from London
on the news of Mr. Falkland's death; 'tis drawn up in
a conci&s;e manner by my mother her&s;elf; if you are
de&s;irous to re-peru&s;e this part of her &s;tory, I will leave
it with you. I told her as I was already acquainted
with Mrs. Arnold's hi&s;tory down to that aera, I had no
curio&s;ity to examine that packet; upon which &s;he locked
it up in a &s;crutoire which &s;tood in the room, and left
me to the peru&s;al of the others.</P>
<P>In three mornings I accompli&s;hed my ta&s;k; and hav|ing
expre&s;&s;ed my acknowledgments to the owner for
the entertainment the&s;e letters had afforded me, I frankly
propo&s;ed the purcha&s;ing them from her, as I thought
her &s;ituation in life would prevent her taking offence at
&s;uch a propo&s;al. She &s;eemed at fir&s;t very unwilling to
part with them; but after urging a good many ar|guments,
together with the offer of a very hand&s;ome
gratuity, &s;he at la&s;t con&s;ented; and I had the &s;atisfac|tion
to carry away with me the remaining part of Mrs.
Arnold's hi&s;tory, which the following &s;heets contain.</P>
<P>The letters which pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Arnold and
her friend Mrs. Cecilia B&mdash;for the fir&s;t eight or nine
years after the final departure of the former from Lon|don,
contain nothing material to the en&s;$ing &s;tory.
The melancholy &s;tate of Mrs. Arnold's mind gave a
gloomy ca&s;t to mo&s;t of tho&s;e which were written by
her in the fir&s;t two or three years of this period: her pa|tience
and her fortitude &s;eemed at length in a great mea|&s;ure
to have &s;ubdued her grief, at lea&s;t they taught her
to &s;uppre&s;s any expre&s;&s;ions of it in her letters to her
friend; and as the &s;ad cau&s;e became le&s;s and le&s;s re|cent,
&s;he appears by degrees to wear off in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
the impre&s;&s;ions of her &s;orrow. The only events
that the editor could gather from a &s;eries of letters du|ring
this interval, was the marriage of Patty Main to
Mr. A&s;kham; the death of Mr. Warner; who after
having purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in Oxford&s;hire
(with a hand&s;ome hou&s;e which he called Woodberry)
left it to Mrs. Arnold, and appears to have died two
years before the date of the fir&s;t letter in this collec|tion:
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and it &s;eems to be much about the &s;ame time that
Mrs. Arnold removed from her former dwelling in
Buckingham&s;hire and came to &s;ettle in this near Oxford,
with a view to be near young Falkland, whom &s;he pur|po&s;ed
to enter in that univer&s;ity. He learn'd al&s;o from
the&s;e letters that lady V&mdash;had undertaken a journey
from Lanca&s;hire on purpo&s;e to vi&s;it Mrs Arnold, and
had pa&s;&s;ed a whole &s;ummer with her; and it appears
that Mrs. Cecilia B&mdash;had generally paid her friend a
vi&s;it once a year.</P>
<P>In order therefore to take up the narrative as near
as po&s;&s;ible to that aera where Cecilia breaks off her's,
he has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the preceding letters, and com|mences
this collection with that which &s;eems, if not
immediately nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t mo&s;t pertinent to the
following &s;tory, as it gives occa&s;ion to Cecilia's reply,
which throws con&s;iderable lights on it. The editor has
here and there only given extracts from letters, the
remainder of which were foreign to his purpo&s;e; and
has &s;ometimes even ventured to throw in little nar|ratives,
the circum&s;tances of which he collected from
a variety of letters, containing &s;everal other things,
and therefore too long and too immaterial, to be in&s;ert|ed
here.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THANK you, thank you, my dear, for delivering
me &s;o &s;peedily from my fears. And &s;o this frightful
alarm has ended at la&s;t in a friendly fit of the gout! I
congratulate Mr. B. upon it; yet I wi&s;h the di&s;order had
been &s;o complai&s;ant as to have &s;ettled in his foot, before
it attacked his &s;tomach; and the good man now truly
can't part with his nur&s;e, but tell him I &s;hall think
him a very tyrant, if he does not let you down to me
<PB N="6" REF="8">
again, as &s;oon as he grows a little better. Here it was
<HI>two</HI> years &s;ince your la&s;t vi&s;it to me, yon were but
twelve hours in my hou&s;e, (&s;even of which you were
a&s;leep) when &s;lap comes down an expre&s;s to hurry you
away to Mr. B&mdash;, who took into his head for&s;ooth that
he was dying! Oh the&s;e men, Cecilia, are &s;o pu&s;illani|mous
when any thing ails them!&mdash;then it is (tho' per|haps
they never di&s;covered it before) that they find the
comfort of a good wife. Pray a&s;k him, my dear, who but
your&s;elf would fit whole days &s;tifling in a room like a
hot-hou&s;e, to hear him &s;narling in his elbow-chair? He
mu&s;t think me very &s;awcy for talking thus of one
with whom I am &s;o little acquainted; but is not that his
own fault? How often have I pre&s;&s;ed him to come in|to
Oxford&s;hire? No, <HI>the con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s of his employ|ment
could never &s;uffer him to pay vi&s;its in the country,</HI>&mdash;
And you one would imagine had an employment at
court too, for it was almo&s;t as difficult to draw you
from London (to which place you <HI>know</HI> I have bid an
eternal adieu) as it is your hu&s;band; but that I know
is his fault, for which I am really angry with him;
for let me tell him I love you, I am almo&s;t tempted to
&s;ay as well as he does.</P>
<P>Remember in this la&s;t ha&s;ty vi&s;it we had neither time
nor opportunity for half an hour's private chat. The
pre&s;ence of my little family prevented my a&s;king you
your opinion of them; and you are &s;o full of Mr.
B&mdash;and his gout, in your letter, that you &s;peak of
nothing el&s;e&mdash;I expect that you will make amends for
this in your next.&mdash;But to be &s;erious, for after all 'tis
nothing but the joy I feel on being delivered from a
painful &s;u&s;pence on your account, which has occa&s;ioned
my &s;pirits to flow into impertinence, I do mo&s;t &s;in|cerely
felicitate you on Mr. B&mdash;'s di&s;order's having
taken &s;o favourable a turn. According to the common
opinion it may give you hope of a much longer con|tinuance
of &s;o valuable a life. That you may for many
years continue a ble&s;&s;ing to each other is the prayer
of your affectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IF you knew all, my dear Sidney, you have le&s;s
rea&s;on to reproach Mr. B&mdash;than you have to
thank him for his indulgence to us both. You know I
told you I had taken lady Mapletoft in my way down to
you, and &s;pent a week with her. The truth is, this
was a thought which occurred to me on the road,
merely, &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;eeing her hou&s;e at the di&s;tance
only of a mile out of my route; and as I had leave of
ab&s;ence for a month, I thought of &s;tealing two or three
days out of it, in order to dedicate them to this old
friend; but I could not refu&s;e her pre&s;&s;ing entreaties to
&s;tay the week out. Now you mu&s;t know that during
that whole week poor Mr. B&mdash;had been labouring
under his painful di&s;order, for he was attacked with it
the day after I left town, and his phy&s;icians could not
tell what to make of it; yet <HI>he,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing I was with
you, would not &s;end for me till the danger was ap|parently
encrea&s;ed: &s;ee therefore, ungrateful as you
are, how much you are indebted to his good nature,
&s;o let me have no more complaints; but make up by
your corre&s;pondence, the lo&s;s I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to in
being deprived of &s;eeing you; for I certainly &s;han't
have it in my power to repeat my vi&s;it to you till next
year.</P>
<P>You wanted to a&s;k my opinion of your young fa|mily,
you &s;ay.&mdash;Sidney, you, who when a girl, with
more rea&s;on to be vain than any woman living, had le&s;s
vanity than any woman living, are I am afraid now
you are come to years of di&s;cretion, (for we are nei|ther
of us old, you know) beginning to grow proud
of your children. What &s;hould my opinion of them
be? The girls are well enough, I think, for little things
bred in the country; and your &s;on Falkland, as you call
him, is a good tolerable fort of a youth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
I have a great mind to &s;top here; Mr. B&mdash;, by
who&s;e bed-&s;ide I write, bids me do &s;o; and to be re|venged
on you for talking of his &s;narling, leave you
with this mortifying reply; but I have too much
chri&s;tian charity to bear malice in my heart, there|fore
take my real &s;entiments, which are, that I do
from my &s;oul think I never &s;aw two &s;uch perfect crea|tures
as your two daughters. I could &s;carce think it
po&s;&s;ible that a little more than two years could have
produced &s;uch an alteration; they appear'd but children
when I was la&s;t in Buckingham&s;hire, and I believe they
now want but very little of your own fine &s;tature. I think
I never &s;aw any thing equal to the exqui&s;ite delicacy of
Mi&s;s Arnold's figure; and for my name-&s;ake, <HI>&s;uch</HI>
a complexion, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> eyes! Oh, Sidney, that
girl would do a world of mi&s;chief if &s;he were in
London; the men would tack her name to &s;word,
pe&s;tilence and famine. Yet I imagine, that tho' her
beauty might <HI>&s;urprize</HI> more, it would <HI>captivate</HI> le&s;s
than that of her &s;i&s;ter; there is an expre&s;&s;ion in the
&s;ofter charms of the elder, that would &s;teal into
the heart without one's perceiving it; and &s;he has
one of tho&s;e faces that a man would fall in love
with, without having fir&s;t di&s;cover'd that &s;he was a
beauty. The endowments of their minds I think
are an&s;werable to tho&s;e of their per&s;ons. How &s;en|&s;ible,
how polite, how mode&s;t is their whole deport|ment!
As for the le&s;&s;er accompli&s;hments in which the
common run of parents fancy the whole of a girl's
education con&s;i&s;ts, which indeed are no more than a
little garniture to it, they had made &s;o con&s;iderable a
progre&s;s in all tho&s;e when I la&s;t &s;aw them, that I &s;up|po&s;e
they are now complete. Indeed, Sidney, they
wanted not the addition of twenty thou&s;and pounds
apiece, to enhance their worth; and I can't help think|ing
it was a &s;trange caprice in that whim&s;ical old cou|&s;in
Warner of your's, to leave them &s;uch a fortune in|dependent
of you. Yet he lived long enough to judge
that their dutiful and &s;weet di&s;po&s;itions would not make
an improper u&s;e of &s;uch an advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
How happy is your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, my dear, if you
can forget the pa&s;t, and look forward to the delightful
pro&s;pect that is before you! May your prudence, your,
virtue, your piety be revived and flouri&s;h, as well as
your beauty does, in the per&s;ons of tho&s;e two lovely
girls. Yet I thought at the time I &s;aw her, and with
a &s;igh have &s;ince recollected, that Mi&s;s Arnold's health
does not &s;eem &s;o perfect as I could wi&s;h. I ob&s;erved a
&s;ort of languor in her countenance; perhaps it was
only my fancy; or it may be the natural ca&s;t of her
vi&s;age. I had not time to mention this when I was
with you, yet I beg you will get the advice of &s;ome
able phy&s;ician; if a decay&mdash;I won't fini&s;h the &s;en|tence
&mdash;God pre&s;erve the dear creature to you! But
pray con&s;ult &s;ome one about her health; the &s;lighte&s;t
attack would &s;hatter &s;o delicate a frame.</P>
<P>Well now I have done with your daughters, a word
or two for your &s;on. That &s;ame Falkland is a charm|ing
pretty young man! You &s;ay he is not &s;o hand&s;ome
as his father was: as I never &s;aw his father, I can't
contradict you; but in my mind he is agreeable enough
to be a very dangerous object in the &s;ame hou&s;e with
two young girls. I know you don't de&s;ign him for
either of them, don't you therefore think it time to
&s;eparate them? Falkland mu&s;t be near eighteen; were
I to judge from his per&s;on only I &s;hould think him
more.&mdash;I was plea&s;ed with his whole carriage, his
filial re&s;pect towards you, and the tender innocent ap|pellation
of &s;i&s;ter to the two girls, delighted me, and
checked the fears, which would otherwi&s;e have ari&s;en,
that he might po&s;&s;ibly have con&s;idered them in another
light. I think him very happy in having &s;o worthy a
conductor as Mr. Price, who &s;eems well to have di&s;|charged
his duty in the care of this youth's education.
With what plea&s;ure the good old man regards his
hopeful pupil!&mdash;I could &s;ay a thou&s;and things more to
you; but Mr. B&mdash;cries out, Have not you done yet?
Yes, my dear, for I am come to the bottom of my
<PB N="10" REF="12">
paper. So adieu, my Sidney, God ble&s;s you and
your amiable family.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Extract from Mrs. ARNOLD'S an&s;wer to Mrs.
CECILIA B&mdash;
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 16th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>&mdash;With regard to Mi&s;s Arnold, 'tis only your
tender fears, my dear, that have &s;ugge&s;ted to you the
thought of her being in an ill &s;tate of health, I never
had any rea&s;on to be of that opinion; yet as I know
young people are apt to conceal flight indi&s;po&s;itions, I
have que&s;tioned her &s;trictly on the &s;ubject, and &s;he
a&s;&s;ures me that nothing ails her. Yet in con&s;equence
of the deference I pay to your judgment, I have con|&s;ulted
the able&s;t phy&s;ician in this country. I &s;uppo&s;e
he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e &s;omething, and there|fore
delivered it as his opinion, that tho' at <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI>
no &s;ymptoms of a di&s;order appeared, yet it was not
impo&s;&s;ible but that the young lady might be <HI>tending
towards</HI> a con&s;umptive habit, on which account he re|commended
by way of prevention only, that &s;he &s;hould
drink a&s;&s;es milk; and accordingly &s;he is to take it every
morning.</P>
<P>I am very glad my little Falkland has your appro|bation.
I know you look with a &s;crutinous eye into
the manners and behaviour of youth. I love this boy
almo&s;t equally with my daughters; for, is he not,
my Cecilia, the &s;on of him who was once &s;o dear to
me, and who&s;e memory mu&s;t ever be precious to my
heart? A hundred times a day does he recall his fa|ther's
image fre&s;h to my remembrance; the &s;ame agree|able
vivacity, the &s;ame in&s;inuating addre&s;s, the &s;ame
tender regard to every one with whom he is con|nected.
His tutor perfectly adores him. My two
<PB N="11" REF="13">
children have always con&s;idered and loved him as a
brother; and I make them call him by that affectionate
name. This idea I inculcated early among&s;t them;
for having taken the dear unhappy orphan into my
protection, with a de&s;ign to have him educated under
my own eye, I thought that precaution would &s;uffi|ciently
guard the young people from ever entertaining
a thought, much le&s;s a wi&s;h, that any other tie &s;hould
ever take place; and indeed is has &s;ucceeded to my
expectations; fraternal affection there is between them,
and &s;o I would have it; but nothing like a particular
preference. To &s;ay the truth, I believe it &s;eldom
happens that per&s;ons brought up together from child|hood,
conceive a pa&s;&s;ion for each other. The eyes
thro' which the hearts of mo&s;t young people are
reached, are fir&s;t &s;truck by novelty; and per&s;ons edu|cated
together almo&s;t from infancy, not having this
advantage with regard to each other, by the time they
come to an age &s;u&s;ceptible of love, would much &s;ooner
be caught by an object le&s;s amiable than that to which
they have been accu&s;tomed, merely becau&s;e it was
new. I mean to provide very hand&s;omely for Falk|land,
and have always told him &s;o; yet de&s;erving as
he is, I would not carry my partiality &s;o far as to be|&s;tow
on him either of my daughters. The unhappy cir|cum&s;tance
of his birth forbids &s;uch a thought, had
he even a fortune which would intitle to &s;o con&s;ide|rable
a match, as each of my daughters will be.
Yet after all, my Cecilia, I think with you, that
Orlando is now arrived at an age, which requires more
precaution on my part, than has hitherto been ne|ce&s;&s;ary.
I left it to his own election to make choice
of any liberal profe&s;&s;ion to which his inclination mo&s;t
led him, for his patrimony is but a trifle.&mdash;His tutor,
who you know is piety it&s;elf, would have per&s;uaded
him to the gown, for with his abilities, he &s;ays, he
would be an ornament to the church; but my &s;on,
who&s;e genius &s;eems to incline him more to the military
life, mode&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the good old man,
and &s;aid he &s;hould prefer the army. To which poor
Mr. Price unwillingly a&s;&s;ented; but as he could not
<PB N="12" REF="14">
bear the thoughts of his pupil's launching out into the
world &s;o extremely young, (for this propo&s;al was made
before we left Buckingham&s;hire) he begg'd to retain
him a year or two longer under his care; and after|wards
pleaded hard that he might enter the univer&s;ity,
where he &s;aid he would learn to &s;et a proper value on
his literary acqui&s;itions, a thing which the old gen|tleman
him&s;elf rates very highly. This &s;tep there|fore
having been long determined, Falkland is to en|ter
as a gentleman commoner of Exeter College the
week after next. Thus you &s;ee, my dear, are your
wi&s;hes anticipated, as Orlando will of cour&s;e remove
immediately from my hou&s;e; and as you know we
are five miles from Oxford, we probably &s;hall &s;eldom
&s;ee him but in the vacations, and at the &s;ame time
be near enough to have an eye to his conduct. Mr.
Price is to continue with me, my chaplain in effect,
tho' my rank in life does not qualify me to confer on
him &s;o formal a title.</P>
<P>All under my roof ki&s;s your hands a thou&s;and
times. Mrs. A&s;kham, who dined with me ye&s;terday,
pre&s;ents her be&s;t re&s;pects to you; &s;he was incon&s;olable
on hearing that you had been in this part of the coun|try,
and had left it before &s;he knew of your arrival.
She &s;ays, had &s;he been informed of it, &s;he would have
flown to Woodberry, if it were only to get one look,
at you.&mdash;Adieu, my love.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 18th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>REJOICED as I always am to hear from you, I
never was better pleas'd at the receipt of any
letter from you than at that of your la&s;t, which came
into my hands at a mo&s;t happy juncture. You mu&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="15">
know we had a vi&s;it from Sir George Bidulph to-day;
he was coming from court, and &s;tepp'd in ju&s;t to a&s;k
Mr. B&mdash;how he did. He &s;eem'd &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;ee|ing
me, as he knew not I was come to town, having
been inform'd the la&s;t time he was here, that I was
gone down to Oxford&s;hire, with a de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing a
month with you</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t how-do-ye's were over, and Mr.
B&mdash;had &s;worn two or three oaths at him, for
hurting his toe with the point of his &s;word, as he
bru&s;hed by his elbow-chair, Sir George addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to me with Well, Madam, how does my &s;i&s;ter
do, for I have not had a line from her the&s;e two
months? Sidney is too methodical a corre&s;pondent
for me, for if I don't an&s;wer her letters punctually, I
am &s;ure not to hear a word from her; and faith 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for a man to find time to write, when he is
&s;o perpetually engaged as I am;&mdash;and then he &s;trut|ted
up to the gla&s;s, again hurt Mr. B&mdash;'s toe,
and received two or three more cur&s;es. I told him I
had left you and your family perfectly well, and that
you had been complaining to me of his &s;ilence. When
are tho&s;e two girls to take the veil? &s;aid he, turning,
to me with a &s;arca&s;tical &s;mile: Or does their mother
intend to marry one of them to young Falkland, and
the other to old Price; for I don't know any other
choice they can have, in that d&mdash;n'd place where &s;he
keeps them buried alive. I was provoked at his gibe,
not having &s;uch an an&s;wer ready as I could have
wi&s;h'd. Mr. B&mdash;laugh'd, and Sir George went
on; I declare, Mrs. B&mdash;, you ladies of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> rate
under&s;tandings, are the mo&s;t unfit people upon earth
to conduct the <HI>common</HI> affairs of life. Would any wo|man
in the world, but Mrs. Arnold, keep two young
ladies like my nieces, mew'd up in &s;uch a wretched
ob&s;cure corner, where it is impo&s;&s;ible they can <HI>learn</HI>
any thing? You forget, I replied, how accompli&s;h'd
your &s;i&s;ter her&s;elf was, who was bred up in the &s;ame
manner. I don't mean, &s;aid he, the common accomp|li&s;hments
that are to be bought by paying a ma&s;ter;
the learning I would have them acquire is a little
<PB N="14" REF="16">
knowledge of the world; which I am &s;ure my &s;i&s;ter
with all her wi&s;dom, nor Price with all his philo&s;ophy,
will never be able to teach them: that is a &s;cience to
be learnt only by mixing <HI>with</HI> the world. Three
years ago, continued he, you may remember, when
lady Sarah was in Buckingham&s;hire, &s;he pre&s;s'd my
&s;i&s;ter to let the two Mi&s;s Arnolds pa&s;s the winter
with her in London, and Sidney's refu&s;al of this re|que&s;t,
though glo&s;s'd over with a thou&s;and fine ex|cu&s;es,
is to tell you the truth, the rea&s;on of our never
having paid her a vi&s;it &s;ince. They were too young
at that time, I replied, and (for want of &s;omething
el&s;e to &s;ay) added, for which perhaps you won't
thank me,&mdash;I dare &s;ay were lady Sarah <HI>now</HI> to make
the &s;ame propo&s;al, Mrs. Arnold would readily em|brace
it. I don't know that, an&s;wered Sir George;
I am afraid that Sidney is in &s;ome re&s;pects but too like
&mdash;he &s;topped &s;hort: but I knew what he <HI>would</HI>
have &s;aid, and that your dear good mother was then
in his thoughts. For heaven's &s;ake, pur&s;ued he (in
his impatient way) do you know what &s;he intends to
do with that boy? To marry him to her elde&s;t dau|ghter,
cried Mr. B&mdash;lengthening out the la&s;t word
from a twitch of the gout, which at that minute &s;eiz|ed
him. By my &s;oul, may be &s;o, &s;aid Sir George;
that would be tipping the &s;pire, and winding up her
bottoms with a witne&s;s. Mr B&mdash;who only &s;poke
in je&s;t, laughed and grunted at Sir George's taking
it &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly. I will venture to &s;ay, replied I, &s;uch
a wild thought never entered into Mrs. Arnold's head.
I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;o too, &s;aid Sir George; your hu&s;|band
has only a mind to be plea&s;ant. No, Mrs. B&mdash;,
continued he very &s;olemnly, well as I loved that noble
fellow his father, who&s;e fate to this hour I deplore, I
would not con&s;ent that my niece &s;hould marry the <HI>il|legitimate</HI>
offspring of the be&s;t man in the kingdom.&mdash;
But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, nothing but frenzy could &s;ug|ge&s;t
&s;uch a thought; a poor fellow who has no pro&s;|pect
in the world but from my &s;i&s;ter's bounty! I own
I could never have a very cordial regard for that youth,
on his vile mother's account; it is an unwarrantable
<PB N="15" REF="17">
prejudice I grant; but as my mother u&s;ed to &s;ay of
hers, (which by the way &s;he would never allow to <HI>be</HI>
prejudices) it is <HI>unconquerable.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this word my maid entered the room, and
gave me your letter: having read it over to my&s;elf,
and found there was nothing in it but what your bro|ther
might &s;ee, I pre&s;ented it to Sir George, who
having kept a profound &s;ilence during the time I took
to read it, I concluded had been waiting in expecta|tion
of at lea&s;t hearing part of it. I reque&s;ted him to
read it aloud, that Mr. B&mdash;might participate with
us.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Sir George's countenance brighten, for I
watched his looks, when he came to that part of it
where you mention your de&s;igns with regard to Or|lando.
In returning me the letter, your brother &s;aid,
Sidney is more <HI>rational</HI> than I expected, (a high com|pliment
you'll &s;ay) you &s;ee in <HI>this</HI> particular, laying
his finger on the paragraph, which related to young
Falkland's birth, &s;he judges pretty much as I do; a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on, my dear, for allowing you to think
<HI>rationally:</HI> and yet, pur&s;ued he &s;miling, I perceive,
from &s;ome part of my &s;i&s;ter's letter, that <HI>you</HI> Mrs.
B&mdash;were not without your fears, ridiculous as the
idea appeared to us all ju&s;t now; for my part I &s;hall
be always ready to <HI>&s;erve</HI> the young man, and as far as
my intere&s;t goes, will pu&s;h him forward in life when
he enters into the profe&s;&s;ion of which he has made
choice; poor fellow, he is not accountable for the
iniquities of his mother. I found that Sir George, &s;o
&s;oon as he had lo&s;t his apprehen&s;ions, &s;uffered his hu|manity
to return. The&s;e men of the world learn, I
believe, to accommodate their feelings as well as their,
language to exteriour circum&s;tances. As for my nie|ces,
continued he, there is no doubt of their being
intitled to marry into &s;ome of the be&s;t families in the
kingdom: but unle&s;s my &s;i&s;ter &s;uppo&s;es that on the
bare <HI>fame</HI> of their perfections, &s;he will have them de|manded
of her like prince&s;&s;es, I don't &s;ee how this is
very likely to be effected. 'Tis a pity you don't get
them to town, &s;aid Mr. B&mdash;; I know no one &s;o fit
<PB N="16" REF="18">
as lady Sarah to introduce them into life. I bit my
lips at this: Ah, thought I, my Sidney <HI>has</HI> a friend,
whom I dare believe &s;he thinks as well qualified as her
lady&s;hip for this ta&s;k; but unfortunately <HI>that friend</HI>
is not enough mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions to make the
offer. Lady Sarah would like it extremely, &s;aid Sir
George, and if Mrs. Arnold is di&s;po&s;ed to let them, I
&s;hall be as ready to receive them as I was before; but
the &s;ea&s;on is now too far advanced for &s;uch a propo|&s;al,
as we &s;hall go into Somer&s;et&s;hire early in the &s;um|mer,
&s;o that this de&s;ign can't po&s;&s;ibly take place till
next winter; I &s;hall however, when I write next to
my &s;i&s;ter, again make her the offer.</P>
<P>I have given you the &s;ub&s;tance of Sir George's con|ver&s;ation,
and &s;hall now throw in as my own opinion,
as well as that of others, that it is really time for
young ladies of your daughters fortunes and condition
in life, to &s;ee a little of the beau monde.&mdash;Their &s;itu|ations
in the world will probably be very con&s;picuous
(at lea&s;t Sir George's endeavours will not be wanting
to make them &s;o) and one would not chu&s;e that young
creatures &s;hould emerge at once from &s;olitude, and
appear as <HI>principals</HI> in the glare and bu&s;tle of the gay
world; for fine as are their under&s;tandings, and
charmingly elegant as is their whole behaviour, there
is a certain ea&s;e of deportment, which you know cha|racterizes
real good breeding, and which can be at|tained
in no other way but by being familiarized to
the modes of the great world; and your <HI>very</HI> fine
people, who do not give mode&s;ty the fir&s;t place in
their catalogue of virtues, would be apt to call the
&s;weet timidity of Mi&s;s Arnold, country ba&s;hfulne&s;s.
Now I want, this to be a <HI>leetle</HI> overcome, before &s;he
is &s;et down perhaps under the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping vi|&s;iting
days for half the coxcombs and flaunting wo|men
of quality in town to a&s;&s;emble at her hou&s;e. Sir
George really keeps the be&s;t company, and lady Sa|rah,
poor as her intellects are, is an adept in all the
fa&s;hionable fopperies of the times, and even <HI>pa&s;&s;es</HI> for
a &s;en&s;ible woman: be&s;ides, what &s;ituation can be more
eligible (your own maternal care out of the que&s;tion)
<PB N="17" REF="19">
than an uncle's hou&s;e, under the guidance of his lady,
both of them people in con&s;iderable e&s;timation?</P>
<P>I have urged this point the more, as I know you
have &s;o mean an opinion of lady Sarah, that I am &s;till
apprehen&s;ive of your unwillingne&s;s to venture &s;o pre|cious
a charge as your two daughters with her: and
I have been the &s;peedier in writing to you, that as I
am certain your brother means to repeat his offer, I
may be beforehand as well in preparing you for it, as
in begging of you to accept it. Pray, my dear, <HI>de|&s;eend</HI>
a little, and think more, like one of <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>I embrace you, and the dear girls, and &s;alute the
fine old man, and the fine young man; and pray tell
Mrs. A&s;kham, that I regret as much as &s;he does our
not having met.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 29th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CECILIA, with all my faults, I was never ac|counted
inflexible; you needed not therefore
have united your force, with that of my brother, to
per&s;uade me to a thing which in it&s;elf I think rea&s;on|able,
and again&s;t which, whatever little collateral
objections I have to it in my own private thoughts, I
can offer none to Sir George, becau&s;e they relate al|together,
as you very well know to lady Sarah. Poor
woman! She was her&s;elf &s;poil'd when a girl by the
weak indulgence of her mother. She has never had
any children of her own, to call forth tho&s;e little ma|ternal
attentions, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in conducting young
people; and &s;he is be&s;ides (notwith&s;tanding the
world's kind opinion) not overburdened with di&s;cre|tion;
&s;o that, upon the whole, I do indeed think
her but a &s;orry pilot to guide a young lady through
the &s;tormy plea&s;ures of your great town I rely how|ever
<PB N="18" REF="20">
ever on my my brother's care, and <HI>have</HI> con&s;ented to
let both my girls be with him next winter: now are
you &s;atisfied?</P>
<P>I received a very obliging letter from my brother
three days ago, in which he kindly repeated his invi|tation
to my daughters; but at the &s;ame time threw
out a hint that vexed me, viz. that having no children
of his own to provide for, his nieces fortunes might not
be <HI>impaired</HI> by making them&s;elves agreeable to him and
lady Sarah.&mdash;This very item, Cecilia, almo&s;t tempt|ed
me to write him a refu&s;al; for won't it look, to
one of Sir George's ca&s;t, (you, my dear, know him as
well as I do) as if it had its weight in inducing me to
comply with a propo&s;al which I had before declined?
Yet <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t be convinced &s;uch a motive could have
no influence on me at any time, if balanced with
more material objections to the offer; how much
le&s;s then in my pre&s;ent affluent flow of fortune? The
truth is, I have yielded to Sir George's reque&s;t merely
for my daughters &s;ake; for I agree with you in every
argument, that you have urged in favour of this &s;tep;
and at the &s;ame time I acknowledge that I &s;hould be
very unwilling to di&s;oblige a brother with whom I
have now lived for &s;o many years upon the be&s;t terms.
And upon reflection, I am plea&s;ed that matters are
&s;ettled as they are; for to tell you a &s;ecret, I had re|&s;olved
to &s;end my daughters to town early next winter
under the care of lady Audley, to whom, next to
your&s;elf, I would &s;ooner commit that important
charge than to any one I know. For &s;he has united
in her, qualities which do not <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> meet in the
&s;ame per&s;on; that is to &s;ay, &s;he is an excellent good
woman, be&s;ides being, in the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> not the mo&s;t <HI>modi&s;h</HI>
acceptation of the word, a <HI>real</HI> fine lady. I believe I
formerly mentioned her to you as one of the fir&s;t ac|quaintances
that I made on my coming to &s;ettle in
this country. She has an elegant little hou&s;e at Ox|ford,
ju&s;t without the town, where &s;he generally pa&s;|&s;es
half the year; and were &s;he to follow her own
inclinations, would prefer living entirely in the coun|try;
but in complai&s;ance to her daughter, &s;he always
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;pends her winters in London. She is to an extrava|gant
degree partial to my two girls; and as there is a
great intimacy between them and Mi&s;s Audley, I
thought they could not be more agreeably &s;ituated.
I am &s;ure lady Audley will be very &s;orry for the di&s;|appointment.
She had pre&s;&s;ed me earne&s;tly, and I
made her a half promi&s;e that my daughters &s;hould be
with her; but if this intention were to have taken
place, I know Sir George would never have forgiven
me, &s;o I think 'tis better as it is. My &s;on took his
leave of us ye&s;terday, and repaired to Oxford to enter
on his academic cour&s;e of life. You can't imagine
how aukward we all felt after his departure. My
two girls cried all the morning: and when we &s;at
down to dinner, the footman having through inadver|tence
placed a chair for him, di&s;concerted us again,
when on his removing it, he &s;aid, I forgot that Mr.
Falkland was <HI>gone.</HI> What do you mean by <HI>gone?</HI>
&s;aid Mr. Price, with as angry a look as his complai|&s;ant
countenance could a&s;&s;ume; is not he ju&s;t by us
here in the neighbourhood? He look'd at me and
then at my two children. The good man him&s;elf
was affected at parting with him, and &s;aw that we
were &s;o too: but this little pa&s;&s;ing cloud &s;oon blew
over, and we are all &s;un&s;hine again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>May 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>POOR lady V&mdash;, how I am grieved for her! I have
ju&s;t received a letter from Mi&s;s Darnley, her
younge&s;t niece, who tells me they are all in the deep|e&s;t
affliction. I believe I have told you that lord V&mdash;'s
undutiful behaviour had &s;o di&s;obliged his mother, that
&s;he had never &s;een him &s;ince his father's death. He
was always her favourite &s;on, and this di&s;appointment
of her hopes it was, which fir&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted her with the
<PB N="20" REF="22">
world, and occa&s;ioned her retiring from it. Lord
V&mdash;, it &s;eems, whether from compunction, or the
overflowings of a heart naturally good, and perverted
only by evil habits, had lately by letter &s;ollicited a
reconciliation with his mother. Lady V&mdash;received
this overture from her &s;on with joy; and having ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, he immediately &s;et out for
Lanca&s;hire, and about a month ago arrived at Mrs.
Darnley's hou&s;e; where he was received by his tender
mother with as much plea&s;ure (&s;o Mi&s;s Darnly ex|pre&s;&s;es
her&s;elf) as his fir&s;t entrance into life had given
her; but her joy was of very &s;hort duration. Lord
V&mdash;was invited to an election-dinner, where having
drank too freeely, he was &s;eized with a fever which
in &s;ix days carried him to his grave. He died in his
mother's arms, with the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of regret
for his pa&s;t ill conduct towards her. What a blow to
&s;o affectionate a parent! How I feel for this excellent
woman! Her tenderne&s;s had revived towards him
with redoubled ardour in this melancholy moment
of eternal &s;eparation; and he was &s;natched from her
at a time, when his returning duty and filial affection
had opened to her a &s;ource of happine&s;s, which &s;he
thought had been for ever &s;hut up. Mi&s;s Darnley
&s;ays &s;he is incon&s;olable; and adds, that neither &s;he nor
her mother are at pre&s;ent in a condition to comfort her,
being them&s;elves too deeply affected at this &s;o unex|pected
and melancholy an event. Mi&s;s Darnley con|cludes
her letter with the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances for
me to go down to Burnly. &startq;Your conver&s;ation,
Madam,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;I know would have a bettar
effect on my aunt than any thing we can &s;ay to her.
Can you then refu&s;e this con&s;olation to poor lady
V&mdash;? If you, do favour us with your company, I
believe I need not tell you how happy it will make
<HI>me,</HI> if you bring with you the two Mi&s;s Arnolds.
Remember you have long owed us a vi&s;it.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Darnley tells me in a po&s;t&s;cript, that the
younger brother, now lord V&mdash;, is at pre&s;ent with his
regiment in Flanders; but that they expect him home
at the end of the campaign.&mdash;I think, my Cecilia,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
this event mu&s;t unroot me. I had as good as re&s;olved
never to have &s;tirred from hence, and began to con&s;i|der
my&s;elf like one of the trees in my grove, which
are doomed to drop unnoticed in the &s;olitude where
they grew. I am really become &s;o in love with my
retirement, that it is a pain to me to think of quitting
it, for ever &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace; yet I am afraid this is
being too &s;elfi&s;h; I will not therefore indulge the habit
which I find every day growing &s;tronger upon me.
How I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, how you would de&s;pi&s;e
your Sidney, if &s;he &s;hould prefer her own &s;atisfaction

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD, to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>June 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OUR little plan of operations has been partly di&s;|concerted
by an accident, which however I hope
will be attended with no other di&s;agreeable con&s;equences
than that of obliging me to leave one of my girls at
home.</P>
<P>A cold which Dolly had got by walking too late by
the river &s;ide, occa&s;ioned my deferring my journey into
Lanca&s;hire for &s;ome days; but as &s;he is now better,
we were all in readine&s;s and intended to have &s;et off
to-morrow morning, when to-day, ju&s;t as we fat down
to dinner, I perceived a chariot, the hor&s;es upon full
gallop, driving up the avenue. It &s;topped at the
door, and Mi&s;s Audley &s;prung out of it, with a pre|cipitation
that alarmed me, as I thought that &s;omething
<PB N="22" REF="24">
extraordinary was the cau&s;e; and &s;o indeed there was;
for what can occa&s;ion greater con&s;ternation to a fine
girl than the fear of lo&s;ing her beauty? The ca&s;e in
&s;hort was this; Ma&s;ter Audley, a boy. of about nine
years old, and the darling of the family, was taken ill
of the &s;mall-pox. Mi&s;s, who is about eighteen, has
never had it, and the doctor no &s;ooner announced the
di&s;temper, than poor lady Audley, in the utmo&s;t terror,
ordered the chariot and hurried her daughter out of
the hou&s;e, who you may imagine was not le&s;s frigh|tened
than her&s;elf. Mi&s;s Audley told me her mama's
extreme apprehen&s;ions had obliged her to intrude upon
my good nature, in begging that I would &s;uffer Mi&s;s
to &s;tay with me till the danger was over. I told the
young lady I was extremely obliged to lady Audley for
honouring me with &s;uch a preference; and that I
&s;hould have thought my&s;elf but too happy in her
company, if an indi&s;pen&s;ible engagement had not for
the pre&s;ent rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for me to enjoy it.
I then told her of the ab&s;olute promi&s;e I was under of
going into Lanca&s;hire; but without mentioning my
de&s;ign of taking my daughters with me; &s;aid if &s;he
would di&s;pen&s;e with <HI>my</HI> ab&s;ence, the two Mi&s;s Arnolds
and Mr. Price (whom I looked upon as the father of
the family) would endeavour to make her &s;tay as
agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. I know, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, you
never go any where without the Mi&s;s Arnolds; I am
certain you meant to take them with you, and 'tis
your politene&s;s only which prevents you from &s;aying
&s;o. I &s;ee I am come un&s;ea&s;onably; Lord, what &s;hall I
do! My dear, an&s;wered I, 'tis paying you but a very
&s;light compliment to leave my daughters with you,
and I a&s;&s;ure you if it were not for breaking thro' the
laws of faith and friend&s;hip, as well as good manners,
I would not &s;tir from home my&s;elf. As I had not in
this reply denied my intention of taking my girls with
me, Mi&s;s Audley an&s;wered, I would not for the
world be the means of hindering the young ladies from
going with you, I am &s;ure lady V&mdash;and Mi&s;s Darnley
would hate me. Dear Mrs. Arnold, continued &s;he,
you can't imagine how I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for be&s;ides the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
opinion my mama has of you and the Mi&s;s Arnolds,
&s;he really has not an acquaintance with whom &s;he
would take the &s;ame liberty, who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he thinks
at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance from the infection, for there is
nothing in nature I &s;o much dread. I know &s;he would
be very unhappy to be obliged to &s;end me to London,
neither &s;hould I be ea&s;y to be &s;o far out of the reach
of hearing from my poor little brother; yet that mu&s;t
be my choice, for po&s;itively I won't con&s;ent to have
the Mi&s;s Arnolds left at home. Well, my dear Mi&s;s
Audley, &s;aid I, to make you ea&s;y at once, I'll com|pound
the matter with you; I will take one of my
daughters with me, and leave the other to keep hou&s;e
with you. That &s;ettles the matter at once, cried out
both my girls in a breath. Mi&s;s Audley made a few
civil objections to this propo&s;al; but they were ea&s;ily
got over, and in the end I agreed to leave Dolly to
bear her company; tho' by the way I thought Cecilia
would have been as well plea&s;ed to have &s;taid as &s;he;
but I made choice of her &s;i&s;ter for two rea&s;ons; Dolly
has a flexibility and tenderne&s;s in her nature, bordering
almo&s;t, as you have ob&s;erved, even upon melancholy,
and I thought the hou&s;e of mourning to which we are
going, would but &s;erve to &s;often her feeling heart too
much. Cecilia, you know, is all vivacity, and not
&s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions. My other rea&s;on was,
that it appeared rather more re&s;pectful to lady Aud|ley,
to leave my elde&s;t daughter by way of my repre|tative.</P>
<P>Thus then have we &s;ettled the&s;e important ceremo|nials,
which had like to have turned us all top&s;y
turvy, and I hold my re&s;olution of &s;etting out to-mor|row;
but I believe this little incident will make me
&s;horten the intended length of my vi&s;it to lady V&mdash;.
I received a letter in the afternoon from lady Audley,
who now being more compo&s;ed, repeated, in very
polite terms, the reque&s;t her daughter had before made
by word of mouth. I writ her lady&s;hip word how
we had accommodated matters, and the young people
&s;eem mightily plea&s;ed at the thoughts of their being
together. Mi&s;s Audley is very amiable; yet for her
<PB N="24" REF="26">
years, I have &s;ometimes thought her a little too
<HI>womanly;</HI> I do not mean by this, that &s;he has the lea&s;t
degree of forwardne&s;s; but &s;he has none of that <HI>timi|dity,</HI>
of which you &s;eemed to wi&s;h, Dolly had le&s;s.
Mi&s;s Audley has overcome it probably by the very
means you recommended, a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with
the gay world; yet I believe her a very good young
creature, I am &s;ure &s;he has an excellent example in her
mother. The elde&s;t &s;on, Sir Edward, is of the &s;ame
college with my Orlando, who &s;peaks very hand|&s;omely
of him; but by the bye I hear he is a little
extravagant, having (as he has been of age &s;ome time)
already dipt his e&s;tate, which is not very con&s;iderable,
yet lady Audley's oeconomy enables her to live with
great elegance on, as I am told, a very moderate
jointure.</P>
<P>Dolly de&s;ires me to conjure you to write to <HI>her</HI> in
my ab&s;ence; we have no corre&s;pondents at pre&s;ent in
London but your&s;elf, and &s;he &s;ays &s;he &s;hall long to
know how you and Mr. B&mdash;do. Adieu, my Cecilia;
when you write next, direct to me at Burnly.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD, to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Burnly, <DATE>July 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU can't imagine, my Cecilia, how I am divided,
at pre&s;ent, in my thoughts: my heart is as it
were cleft in twain, and while one half of it is re|tained
in Oxford&s;hire, the other remains chained here,
by the tender ties of compa&s;&s;ion as well as friend&s;hip
for poor lady V&mdash;. She &s;till continues in the &s;ame me|lancholy
&s;tate; that &s;tupor, which I told you had &s;uc|ceeded
to the fir&s;t outrages of her grief, is much more
alarming to her friends than her former condition. She
&s;its for hours without &s;peaking, and no one in the hou&s;e
but my&s;elf can rouze her from her lethargy. She takes
<PB N="25" REF="27">
delight in hearing me talk over my own melancholy
&s;tory, and it is by this means only we can engage her
to enter into conver&s;ation; and indeed it is by this
means that I am not without hope of bringing her by
degrees to a better frame of mind; for &s;he con&s;tantly
compares <HI>my</HI> calamities with her <HI>own,</HI> then condemns
her own impatience under an evil which &s;he allows
inferior to <HI>many</HI> I have &s;uffered, prai&s;es my fortitude,
and promi&s;es to imitate it, yet again relap&s;es into her
grief. Thus circum&s;tanced, you &s;ee 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
me to de&s;ert her; yet when I think of poor Dolly's &s;itu|ation,
I am almo&s;t tempted (&s;elfi&s;h as I am) to leave my
friend a prey to her &s;orrow, and fly to my child. The
dear creature! &s;he has gone through a &s;cene of unea&s;i|ne&s;s
and anxiety, which her tenderne&s;s for me made her
conceal till the danger was over. I had a letter from
her by the la&s;t po&s;t, wherein &s;he tells me &hellip;&hellip;</P>
<P>[Here Mrs. Arnold gives the &s;ub&s;tance of what her
daughter writes; but as the young lady's own letter
appears, her mother's account of it is omitted. Mrs.
Arnold then proceeds]</P>
<P>To be &s;incere with you, I had no &s;ooner read this,
than forgetting the duties of charity, as well as my at|tachments
of gratitude to lady V. I as good as re&s;olved
to return home directly. I even went &s;o far as to ap|prize
Mrs. Darnley of my de&s;ign, putting my daugh|ter's
letter at the &s;ame time into her hand. The tears
came into the poor lady's eyes the minute I talked of
going; for &s;he doats on her &s;i&s;ter. What will become
of us, cried &s;he, when you are gone? The agitation
&s;he ob&s;erved in my countenance made her conclude
that &s;omething indi&s;pen&s;ible called me away. Having
read my daughter's letter, Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my dear
madam, &s;aid &s;he, read this over again, and then I
hope you will not think there is &s;o <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> a nece&s;&s;ity
for your pre&s;ence at Woodberry. My fears, indeed,
upon a &s;econd peru&s;al, were much abated, and I found
that my imagination only had painted to me as <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="28">
a danger which in reality had been over for &s;ome time.
What becomes of our rea&s;on, my Cecilia, in tho&s;e
moments of &s;urprize? to what corner does the &s;lug|gard
retire, to wait for the calmer hours of reflection,
when the bu&s;y pa&s;&s;ions are all up and alarmed?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure Dolly would not deceive me: I therefore
flatter my&s;elf that matters are as well at home as &s;he
has repre&s;ented them, yet I cannot be quite ea&s;y at this
di&s;tance from my family. Poor Cecilia wi&s;hes to be
with her &s;i&s;ter: indeed I almo&s;t repent my having
brought her with me; yet how could I refu&s;e Mi&s;s
Darnley's reque&s;t, e&s;pecially after &s;he had my promi&s;e
that both my daughters &s;hould attend her? In &s;hort, I
am in &s;uch an un&s;ettled &s;tate of mind, as really gives
&s;ome little merit to my &s;tay at Burnly. Yet I am
a&s;hamed to balance what I con&s;ider merely as the par|tial
tenderne&s;s of a parent, with the more important
offices of Chri&s;tianity, which, in poor lady V 's ca&s;e,
<HI>demand</HI> my attendance here; and I could never for|give
my&s;elf, if I neglected the means which her friends,
and indeed I my&s;elf, think are in my power to re&s;tore,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, her mind to tranquillity. Thus con|&s;trained
by duty, I believe I mu&s;t continue here, ac|cording
to my fir&s;t promi&s;e, till the latter end of Au|gu&s;t;
&s;o that you mu&s;t expect nothing from hence but
the anecdotes of this gloomy man&s;ion.</P>

<OPENER>Mi&s;s ARNOLD to Mrs. ARNOLD.
(The Letter which is referred to in the above.)
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 8th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DON'T be angry with me, my dear mama, for
having concealed from you an accident which
terrified us all here to death; but our apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="27" REF="29">
are now over, thank God, thank God! Do not be
frightened, madam, for indeed the danger is intirely
pa&s;t; but we had like to have lo&s;t, Oh! mama, we
had like to have lo&s;t poor Orlando!</P>
<P>About a week ago he came to &s;ee us one evening,
and Sir Edward Audley came with him, to pay a vi&s;it
to his &s;i&s;ter. I never loved that Sir Edward Audley,
and &s;hall love him now le&s;s than ever. Mr. Falkland
and he were in the garden together, and Sir Edward
(unlucky creature!) propo&s;ed leaping from the haha at
the end of the terrace into the meadow. Mi&s;s Audley
and I were looking at them from my dre&s;&s;ing room
window. Sir Edward took his leap fir&s;t, and came on
his feet at the other &s;ide. Orlando followed him; we
&s;aw him fall, and that even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
companion he &s;eemed not able to ri&s;e. Mi&s;s Audley &s;ays
I &s;hriek'd out. I can't tell whether I did or not; but
I know I found my&s;elf at the end of the terrace with|out
knowing how I got thither. Poor Orlando was
&s;tanding up by that time, and &s;eemed to be in violent
pain. Sir Edward told us that the ground being &s;lip|pery
(for we have had a good deal of rain lately) had
occa&s;ioned him to mi&s;s his &s;tep, and having leaped ju&s;t
on the edge of the &s;teep, he had tumbled down and
di&s;located his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>He walked in, though with difficulty. Mr. Price
(good, good man, how I love him for his fatherly ten|derne&s;s)
was in the utmo&s;t concern. He &s;ent immedi|ately
to Oxford for Mr. O&s;wald, who not being very
readily to be found, poor Orlando &s;uffered four hours
of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture. I think I am no very
great coward, mama, when any thing ails me; but I
don't know how it is, the &s;eeing another in violent pain
has &s;omething in it that extremely affects my &s;pirits:
for when Mr O&s;wald (who did not arrive till near ten
o'clock at night) was &s;etting Mr. Falkland's &s;houlder,
I fainted away twice, though I was in a di&s;tant part of
the hou&s;e, merely at the thought of what he endured.
When the operation was over, Mr. Price had him put
into bed, and &s;at up with him the whole night; but
we had all, thoughtle&s;s as we were, neglected one
<PB N="28" REF="30">
material thing, which was what had like to have been
fatal to Mr. Falkland; for with regard to the accident
of his &s;houlder, Mr. O&s;wald &s;aid there was nothing
dangerous in it; but it &s;eems the bottom of that vile
ditch into which he had fallen was full of water, and
he had been wet quite through, without either he him|&s;elf
or any of us perceiving it: &s;o that having fat &s;o
long in that condition, he had got a violent cold,
which threw him the next day into a high fever.
I would have written to my dear mama an account of
this immediately; but I am glad I was directed by a
wi&s;er head than my own. Mr. Price advi&s;ed me not;
he thought it would be giving you unnece&s;&s;ary pain, as
probably his pupil's di&s;order might go off in a few
days: this, therefore, it was which prevented my
mentioning our &s;ituation to you in my la&s;t letter; but
indeed, madam, you know not what I have &s;uffered
&s;ince. They would all have per&s;uaded me that
Orlando never was in any <HI>very</HI> great danger; but I
am &s;ure <HI>I</HI> thought he was, and for five days and
nights have never left his bed-&s;ide, in &s;pite of all that
Mr. Price or Mi&s;s Audley could &s;ay to me She in|deed
is kind enough to &s;it up with me; Mrs. Nel&s;on
does the &s;ame; but the unfeeling fat old woman al|ways
falls a&s;leep in the ea&s;y chair. Pray, mama,
would not you have watched your poor Orlando with
as much care as I have done? I am &s;ure you would.
But he is now, with joy I can a&s;&s;ure you, he is now
much better. He pre&s;ents his duty and mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful
love to you, and begs to be tenderly remember|ed
to my &s;i&s;ter. Be &s;o good, madam, to make my
compliments to lady V. Mrs. and Mi&s;s Darnley, and
tell my Cecilia I long to embrace her. Mr. Price
bids me a&s;&s;ure you, that he never forgets you in his
devotions.</P>

<OPENER>Mi&s;s AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>OH 'tis in vain, 'tis all in vain!</HI>&mdash;I hope, my dear
Edward, you will not go on with the old &s;ong,
and &s;ay, <HI>Death and de&s;pair mu&s;t end the fatal, fatal,</HI>
&amp;c. But in plain pro&s;e, all that I have been &s;aying
and doing for you is to no purpo&s;e, and our de&s;ign is
dropt plumb to the ground!&mdash;Heavens! cry you, is it
po&s;&s;ible? can the lovely, the tender, the flexible Do|rothea
(for <HI>Dolly</HI> won't do when we talk in hero|ics)
can &s;he in that &s;oft bo&s;om hide a flinty heart?
No &s;uch thing, child, her heart is as tender as you
could wi&s;h it; nay more, this fair in&s;en&s;ible, this ala|ba&s;ter
&s;tatue, as you u&s;ed to call her, glows at this
minute with the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion! but not for you,
Edward; no, brother, you are not the happy man,
Who the deuce is then? cry you again. Simpleton,
can't you gue&s;s? But I don't wonder that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould
not when the poor thing her&s;elf did not know a
word of the matter till <HI>I</HI> found it out for her. I'll
tell you how it was. You remember the evening that
Falkland met with the accident, Mi&s;s Arnold and I
were looking at you from one of the windows. Her
frantic &s;cream at &s;eeing him fall, and her flying like
a wood-nymph to the place where he lay, gave me
the fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the real &s;tate of her heart, and
determined me to ob&s;erve her clo&s;ely. On finding
him &s;o violently hurt, I perceived an energy in her
grief to which neither friend&s;hip nor &s;raternal love
could have given ri&s;e; for well as I love you, Edward,
I do really believe I &s;hould not have been &s;o much af|fected,
had the mi&s;chance befallen you, as &s;he was at
its having happened to Falkland; and yet the poor in|nocent
deceived her&s;elf with a belief that it was only
becau&s;e <HI>our brother</HI> Orlando, as their mother has
taught them to call him, had met with &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter
<PB N="30" REF="32">
During the time of his illne&s;s, &s;he was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of his danger (a natural fear
where a life <HI>particularly</HI> dear to us is in the que&s;tion)
that &s;he <HI>would</HI> watch by him her&s;elf. <HI>I</HI> in civility
to her could not avoid doing the &s;ame. As for hone&s;t
Price, who &s;aw there was nothing really dangerous in
the ca&s;e, he u&s;ed after he had &s;moaked his pipe and
<HI>&s;et the watch,</HI> as he called it (finding he could not per|&s;uade
Mi&s;s Arnold out of her apprehen&s;ions) to retire
quietly to bed. The hou&s;ekeeper, for form &s;ake,
always made one of our nocturnal party; but the
good woman con&s;tantly &s;nored away the night in per|fect
tranquillity. It was in tho&s;e hours I &s;aw the ge|nuine
&s;ource of Dolly's attention laid open. With
what tender folicitude did &s;he watch every breath that
he re&s;pired! If he &s;ighed, &s;he &s;tarted, and with a
voice &s;ofter than the breezes of the younge&s;t Zephyr,
would &s;he enquire how he did. She would her&s;elf
give him &s;uch little medicines as were pre&s;cribed;
and I could ob&s;erve her hand tremble, when in pre|&s;enting
them to him, it happened to touch his. Oh,
Edward, the&s;e &s;ymptoms were too &s;trong not to indi|cate
the di&s;ea&s;e to one <HI>more</HI> ignorant than I am. I
knew Dolly was as ingenuous as truth it&s;elf; yet love
teaches the be&s;t of us art, and I was re&s;olved to try
what proficiency &s;he had made in its &s;chool. I pre|tended,
the night before la&s;t, to be very drowzy,
and begged &s;he would di&s;pen&s;e with my fitting up
with her. Ble&s;s me, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ure you would not
leave me to attend Mr. Falkland alone! you know
Nel&s;on cannot keep awake a minute&mdash;And of what
u&s;e would &s;he be to you, I replied, were &s;he ever &s;o
watchful, &s;ince you take the care of your patient in|tirely
on your&s;elf? But the <HI>impropriety</HI> of it! &s;aid
Mi&s;s Arnold.&mdash;<HI>Impropriety,</HI> my dear! what impro|priety
is there in attending a &s;ick <HI>brother?</HI> I &s;aid the
la&s;t word with an empha&s;is, fixing my eyes on her at
the &s;ame time, and I believe I looked a little arch|ly.
&mdash;A faint blu&s;h over&s;pread her face, and with a
&s;igh &s;he an&s;wered, Oh, Sophy, you know that is but
a <HI>name,</HI> and that Mr. Falkland is in reality no relation
<PB N="31" REF="33">
to me. Ah, Dolly, cried I, have I at la&s;t caught
you? I am no longer now to &s;eek the cau&s;e of your
being &s;o deaf to all my pleadings for poor Sir Ed|ward!
She looked terrified&mdash;What do you mean,
Mi&s;s Audley? Nothing, my dear, but that you love
Falkland better. Certainly, <HI>maam</HI>&mdash;But <HI>much</HI> better,
Mi&s;s Arnold, better than you do any body&mdash;We have
been brought up together, &s;aid &s;he (her voice falter|ing
as if in an ague fit) I have been taught&hellip;to
love him from my infancy. A&s;k your heart this plain
que&s;tion, &s;aid I, and report to me hone&s;tly the an|&s;wer
it makes you; Is there any one in the world &s;o
dear to it as Orlando Falkland? She pau&s;ed a little,
then bur&s;ting into tears, &s;he threw her&s;elf on my neck,
and only &s;obbed out, Oh, Mi&s;s Audley, this is cruel!
I let her pa&s;&s;ion have vent, then embracing her in my
turn, You have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed, my dear,
&s;aid I; for &s;pight of my partiality to my brother (who&s;e
hopes I &s;ee are now at an end) I mu&s;t acknowledge
that I know no one more amiable or more de&s;erving
of your heart than Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>My <HI>heart!</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and again renewed her tears;
Oh fye, fye upon &s;uch a heart, that never gave me
warning of my danger till it was pa&s;t remedy! But I
have one comfort left, added &s;he, Orlando has not
the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that I&mdash;The formidable word
<HI>love</HI> &s;tuck in her throat, and &s;he &s;topped &s;hort; but I
eek'd out the &s;entence for her. and replied coolly,
<HI>that you love him;</HI> he mu&s;t be blind then, for I have
&s;een it a long time&mdash;What a weak wretch I am! cried
&s;he. For what, my dear mi&s;s Arnold? Is there any
thing blameable in your loving a hand&s;ome accom|pli&s;hed
young man, whom every one admires? But
circum&s;tanced as I am, &s;aid &s;he, and without the lea&s;t
advance on his &s;ide, who, I am &s;ure, only con&s;iders
me as a friend&mdash;There, my dear, I am &s;ure you are
in an error; for if I am not mi&s;taken, Falkland loves
you as well as you do him. I &s;aw a beam of plea&s;ure
lighten in her languid eyes; for however repugnant
to prudence, to intere&s;t, nay to duty and rea&s;on it|&s;elf,
our pa&s;&s;ion may be, though we endeavour to
<PB N="32" REF="34">
hide it, and even wi&s;h and &s;truggle perhaps to rid
our&s;elves of it, though the accompli&s;hment of our
wi&s;hes may be at ever &s;o great a di&s;tance; nay though
they appear even impracticable, yet there is a be|witching
plea&s;ure in the thought of being beloved
again that we cannot re&s;i&s;t. This is vanity, brother;
but it is the way of us women; and of you men too,
I &s;uppo&s;e, if you would but be hone&s;t enough to own
it; but your pride helps you out on tho&s;e occa&s;ions,
and if you are not kindly received, you a&s;&s;ume a no|ble
air of indifference, are &s;orry you lo&s;t &s;o much
time, and will give your&s;elf no farther trouble, when
all the while you would part with one of your eyes
to make the poor woman as unea&s;y as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Well, but now you will a&s;k me how comes it that
I not only de&s;erted <HI>your</HI> cau&s;e, but even became an
advocate for Falkland? The que&s;tion is pertinent,
Sir, and de&s;erves a &s;erious an&s;wer. Thus it is then.</P>
<P>To be plain with you, though I could not re&s;i&s;t
your intreaties, I had very little hopes of this affair
from the beginning. When I fir&s;t mentioned your
love to Mi&s;s Arnold, and endeavoured to &s;ound <HI>her</HI> in|clinations,
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf &s;o <HI>very</HI> civilly of you,
that I at once gave the thing up for lo&s;t. Had &s;he
affected not to under&s;tand me, and given her&s;elf a
few pretty airs (which by the bye the poor dear girl
does not know how to do) nay, had &s;he pretended to
have been angry with <HI>me,</HI> and found twenty faults
with <HI>you;</HI> I &s;hould have had &s;ome hopes of her. But
no &s;uch thing; &s;he re&s;ented not my urging your &s;uit,
nor threw out a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;approbation
towards you; but on the contrary, having paid your
per&s;onal merit &s;ome compliments, &s;he added, Yet I
wi&s;h, for his own as well as <HI>your</HI> &s;ake, that he had
honoured &s;ome one el&s;e with his affections; for be&s;ides
(forgive me, my dear) &s;ome objections which I know
my mama would have to him, I really do not find in
my&s;elf the lea&s;t inclination towards him.</P>
<P>This was too mortifying a reply, Sir Edward, to
be repeated to a lover; and you know, therefore,
that without ab&s;olutely extingui&s;hing your hopes I
<PB N="33" REF="35">
never flattered them. The truth is, I did not then
&s;u&s;pect that you had a rival, and did not know what
time, per&s;everance, and opportunity might do; ac|cordingly,
having lo&s;t the hopes of the girls being in
town with us next winter, I made my&s;elf an inmate
at Woodberry, in order to improve, if po&s;&s;ible, eve|ry
minute to your advantage; but I am now con|vinced
my endeavours will be fruitle&s;s with regard to
mi&s;s Arnold, and I do mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly recommend it to
you to think no more of her. Now do I &s;ee you
bite your lips, <HI>Think no more of her!</HI> that's mighty
ea&s;ily, &s;aid, truly! And &s;o all my expectations, and
your pretended efforts to &s;erve your brother, mu&s;t
end in, <HI>Think no more of her!</HI> How ridiculous this is
of you, Sophy, when I have told you that I am in,
love with mi&s;s Arnold!&mdash;Very true; but have not
you at the &s;ame time a &s;mall tendre&s;&s;e for her for|tune,
my dear brother? P&s;ha, what then? Ought
not you, for that very rea&s;on, not &s;o &s;lightly to have
given up my intere&s;ts, and preferred tho&s;e of my ri|val?
And now pray what are tho&s;e rea&s;ons which you
were to give me for acting &s;o unkind a part? Softly,
don't be in a pa&s;&s;ion, and I'll tell you; for this is the
very place where they will come in pat. Mi&s;s Ar|nold,
I again repeat it to you once for all, is as much
out of your reach as if &s;he were in the moon. I am
&s;orry for it, becau&s;e I believe you love her; at the
&s;ame time I cannot think a flame &s;o newly kindled
can have gathered &s;trength enough to render it inex|tingui&s;hable.
Don't you think it po&s;&s;ible, my dear
Edward, to transfer it to her &s;i&s;ter? Cecilia has <HI>twen|ty
thou&s;and pounds</HI> as well as Dolly; &s;he is very pretty,
very, lively, and it is to be pre&s;umed intirely di&s;en|gaged;
and as you never made any <HI>per&s;onal</HI> addre&s;&s;es
to mi&s;s Arnold, what I have &s;aid to her can ea&s;ily be
turned off. I have known a court&s;hip begun in plea|&s;antry,
and apparently to pique another woman, end
in very &s;erious con&s;equences. I can tell you it was
Cecilia that my mama had in her thoughts for you
when &s;he pre&s;&s;ed Mrs. Arnold to let both the ladies
pa&s;s the winter with her in London; for indeed we
<PB N="34" REF="36">
were both of opinion that Dolly was too re&s;erved,
and too much bigotted to her duty, to venture on di&s;|po&s;ing
of her&s;elf without her mother's con&s;ent, and
that's a thing not to be look'd for; for be&s;ides Mrs.
Arnold's thinking you a little <HI>naughty,</HI> as Dolly hinted
to me, there are &s;uch things as jointures and &s;ettle|ments
and &s;uch impertinent incumbrances, always
tack'd to the tail of a parent's con&s;ent; and you are
&s;en&s;ible it would be rather inconvenient to you at
pre&s;ent to have your rent roll &s;crutinized by fellows
in great wigs. My advice, therefore, is, that you
leave Falkland in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his conque&s;t,
and turn your arms towards a le&s;s impregnable for|tre&s;s.
Having given you the end of my clue, now
can't you go on unwinding it, till you have develop|ed
the rea&s;ons of my conduct, which lie &s;nug, like a
&s;ilkworm in the mid&s;t of its web? You can't, you
&s;ay! You are very dull, Edward; you a logician!
Don't you &s;ee that if, mi&s;s Arnold be. encouraged in
her inclination for Falkland, &s;he may by degrees be
brought to receive his private addre&s;&s;es? Terrified
as &s;he now is at, the bare thought of &s;uch a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion,
the approaches to it will be &s;o &s;weet, &s;o
flattering, to her wi&s;hes, that &s;he may be led imper|ceptibly
to the very point; the mere, mention of
which would, at this minute, make her &s;tart. And
don't you &s;ee that this, will open the way for you to
her &s;i&s;ter? If Dolly &s;hould after all be &s;o old-fa&s;hion'd
as to yield the intere&s;ts of her heart to her obedience,
as her mother did before her, why there's an end
of my whole plan; but if on the contrary, the girl;
&s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as &s;he is in favour of Falkland,
and aided, with a. little of my good advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
will pluck up &s;pirit enough to choo&s;e for
her&s;elf, I think our, or rather <HI>my</HI> de&s;ign, may be
accompli&s;hed. There is nothing like the force of ex|ample,
Edward; and Cecilia has been &s;o u&s;ed to look
up to her &s;i&s;ter as a pattern, that it would be &s;trange
if &s;he would not follow her lead in this, as well as
in other things. Short as my acquaintance with the
world has been, many a match have I known brought
<PB N="35" REF="37">
about by this very means. You can't imagine how
aukward a girl feels if her &s;i&s;ter has a lover, and &s;he
none. I take it for granted that Falkland need only
be informed of them, to avail him&s;elf of the kind
&s;entiments mi&s;s Arnold has for him. Be it your care
to acquaint him with that &s;ecret, as one you picked
out of me. You know nothing is more natural; and
this of cour&s;e mu&s;t engage him to forward your inte|re&s;ts
with Cecilia. They &s;ay grief is lightened by
partner&s;hip: I fancy people think that blame is &s;o
too; for we are generally mighty glad to have others
participate with us in the &s;ame fault, and I don't
&s;uppo&s;e that a young man of Falkland's age and &s;pi|rit
will be over &s;crupulous on this point; neither do
I &s;ee any rea&s;on why young ladies, who&s;e fortunes
render them independent, &s;hould not plea&s;e them|&s;elves
in the choice of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>I have written this letter by fits and &s;tarts, as I
could &s;teal time and opportunity. Poor Dolly is &s;o
frightened at the di&s;covery &s;he has made of the &s;itu|ation
of her own heart, that &s;he appears to me as if
&s;he wanted to fly from her&s;elf, and, contrary to tho&s;e
romantick lovers who choo&s;e in &s;olitude to indulge
their tender ideas, &s;he &s;eeks my company more than
ever. Not to talk of Falkland though, don't mi&s;take
the matter; &s;he is now afraid even to name him,
and always tries to avoid the &s;ubject; but I, who
think it would be a pity &s;o bright a flame &s;hould
die for want of a little <HI>fanning,</HI> contrive always to
introduce him into our conver&s;ation by the name of
<HI>&s;ome</HI> body, and under this appellation &s;he &s;uffers me
to &s;ay twenty wild things that, would &s;tartle her were
I to join the dreaded name of <HI>Falkland</HI> to them. Long
as this letter is, I have a hundred other things to &s;ay
to you; but I'll &s;end it off as it is, and when you
have con&s;idered the matter a little, let me know your
mind.</P>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 13th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have taken three days to con&s;ider your long let|ter;
and the &s;ea&s;on is, becau&s;e I only <HI>think</HI> as
you <HI>write,</HI> by fits and &s;tarts. I laughed heartily at
that part of it where you &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly recommend Ce|cilia
to me, It put me in mind (pardon the compa|ri&s;on)
of my man David, who having lo&s;t a very fine
pointer, of which I was extremely fond, told me,
he'd <HI>&s;ee and get me another every jot as pre'ty.</HI> Blockhead,
&s;aid I, what's that to the purpo&s;e? Lord, Sir,
&s;aid he, is not one dog as good as another?&mdash;You
&s;eem to be pretty much of David's opinion, Sophy,
and to think that one <HI>woman</HI> is as good as another;
and faith, upon the whole, you are not much mi&s;ta|ken:
for to me the only e&s;&s;ential difference is for|tune;
and I would not abate a girl a thou&s;and pound
for all the charms of Helen, and the cha&s;tity of Lu|crece
into the bargain.</P>
<Q><L>That I did love the gentle Dorothea, is mo&s;t true:</L>
<L>True, I would have married her&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>But &s;ince &s;he has &s;lipped through our fingers, I'll
e'en be content with Cecilia, who, as David &s;aid of
the dog, is every jot as pretty. Seriou&s;ly, I do ex|ceedingly
admire mi&s;s Arnold; and when I appointed
you my &s;oft emba&s;&s;adre&s;s, I commi&s;&s;ioned you to
&s;peak the real &s;entiments of my heart; for I <HI>was</HI>
within a hair's breadth of being actually in love with
her, and <HI>had</HI> &s;he been kind!&mdash;But 'tis no matter,
I'll not hang my&s;elf this bout; my heart, (how I
hug the dear rogue for it) is as obedient to me as my
hand, and I have forbid it ever to breathe another,
&s;igh for her.&mdash;<HI>She does not find in her&s;elf the lea&s;t in|clination
towards me.</HI> Was not that her provoking
<PB N="37" REF="39">
cold reply? Oh the little &s;orcere&s;s! I wi&s;h I had hold
of her. I'll write tho&s;e freezing words on &s;crolls of
paper, and wear them as the Jews did their philacte|ries,
as amulets again&s;t her in&s;olent charms.&mdash;<HI>Let
her go, I'll think no more of her</HI>&mdash;and yet &s;he is a
charming creature! and &s;o is Cecilia: tho&s;e two &s;i&s;|ters
have often reminded me of Cowley's de&s;cription of
the two daughters of Saul. How is it? for you are
better acquainted with old Dan Cowley than I am&mdash;
<Q><L>The &s;tately Merab, &s;eems &s;ome regal tower,</L>
<L>Michal, &s;ome virgin queen's delicious bower.&mdash;</L></Q>
Ay, that &s;ame little Michal &s;hall be my choice. I
thank you for putting me in mind of her: there is
&s;omething in the very name of Cecilia that conveys
to me an idea of the blu&s;h and fragrance of opening
ro&s;es, the pure un&s;ullied whitene&s;s of the lilly, and
all the glowing beauties of the &s;pring; for is &s;he
not her&s;elf the godde&s;s of it? Youth and health
dance in her &s;prightly eyes, and <HI>her</HI> Cupids, in&s;tead
of being &s;piteful urchins that delight in mi&s;chief,
are good-humoured little laughing cherubs, who&s;e
harmle&s;s &s;hafts tickle rather than wound. But after
all, &s;uppo&s;e (for it is good to &s;uppo&s;e every thing
within the laws of po&s;&s;ibility) that this girl &s;hould,
like her &s;i&s;ter, take it into her head not to like me,
what is to be done then? for po&s;itively my affairs
are in a con founded bad way. For between the
roguery of my father's agent, who pretends (though
I am &s;ure I had not half the money) that he let me
have near two thou&s;and pounds, even before my fa|ther's
death, and for which the old dog has &s;ince got a
mortgage; between his knavery, I &s;ay, and my own
little vagaries &s;ince, I owe above &s;ix thou&s;and
pounds, not to mention a charge on the e&s;tate of
three thou&s;and more for Harry; a heavy tax, So|phy,
on poor twelve hundred a year, out of which
too, you know, I pay my mother her jointure;
think of this, my girl, and tremble for your poor
brother's &s;ituation!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
But now, after having &s;uppo&s;ed the wor&s;t, (after
which nothing but a gulph opens before, where <HI>con|jectural</HI>
will be &s;wallowed up in <HI>certain</HI> de&s;truction)
let us &s;uppo&s;e the be&s;t, and that Cecilia &s;hould not
find in her&s;elf any <HI>di&s;</HI>-inclination towards me, how
are we to conduct this affair to a happy i&s;&s;ue? For
my part, I own, even &s;pite of your's and my mother's
management, that I fore&s;ee many difficulties in the
way. For let us grant that both the ladies like, or,
if you will, <HI>love</HI> their men, is there not a wide dif|ference
with girls brought up as they have been,
between <HI>loving</HI> without con&s;ent, and <HI>marrying</HI> with|out
con&s;ent? If I meant nothing but a little amour,
I &s;hould have better hopes of it; for, with reverence
to cha&s;tity be it &s;poken, a lady may fall into &s;uch a
&s;crape contrary to her intentions; and many a poor
innocent has &s;lipped unawares into the trap, where
&s;he has been content to &s;tay, rather than like the
&s;illy mou&s;e tear her&s;elf in endeavouring to get out:
but this, you know, is out of the que&s;tion, and I
have at lea&s;t the merit of being an <HI>honourable</HI> lover.</P>
<P>Yet after all, you women under&s;tand one another
be&s;t, and know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that if love and duty
fall to wre&s;tling in a female heart, which of the
two is likelie&s;t to have his heels tripped up. I do
therefore commit this weighty affair to your wi&s;e di|rection,
and own I think your conclu&s;ions are fairly
drawn: for &s;ince Mi&s;s Arnold <HI>does</HI> love Falkland,
though I could cur&s;e her for doing &s;o, the mo&s;t pro|bable,
means to promote our (for now you may call
them <HI>our</HI>) de&s;igns, is to encourage her in it; there|fore
be &s;ure, Sophy, you u&s;e your <HI>fan</HI> judiciou&s;ly.
For my part, if I can di&s;cover in Falkland's heart
but a &s;park no bigger than the point of a needle, I'll
apply an organ-bellows to it, till I have kindled &s;uch
a flame, as &s;hall light us both to happine&s;s, or con|&s;ume
him in the conflagration. Yet I have no enmity
to <HI>him,</HI> but on the contrary like him, and think him
a very pretty fellow: but I a&s;&s;ure you he would have
been utterly &s;poiled, if he had remained another year
under the tuition of that old drone Price; for you
<PB N="39" REF="41">
cannot imagine what chimerical notions he had put
into the poor lad's head about the Lord knows what!
but I hope to cure him of them by degrees, for there
is a good <HI>&s;oil</HI> there, though he has got &s;ome &s;trange
prejudices, by living &s;o many years in &s;uch a <HI>praying</HI>
family. We need not, however, I hope, be much
afraid of his <HI>&s;cruples,</HI> though, he was wonderfully
troubled with them when he fir&s;t came to college,
and u&s;ed to blu&s;h like a young mi&s;s; but he has al|ready
got over that, for I have initiated him into
a few my&s;teries, and purpo&s;e, at his return, to in|troduce
him into our club, of which you have heard
me make honourable mention: it will help to file off
a little of that pedantic &s;uper&s;titious ru&s;t with which
the old dryad of Woodberry-grove had incru&s;ted his
intellects: but I &s;hall not be able to give him the la&s;t
poli&s;h till I get him to London, which I purpo&s;e
doing next vacation. Mean while, if we can bring
about an eclairci&s;&s;ement between him and his love, I
think our affair will be in a pro&s;perous way, and I
&s;hall have nothing to do but commence my attack,
when my little delicious bower returns from Burnly.</P>
<P>I never writ &s;o long a letter in my life&mdash;Whuph!
it is pa&s;t two o'clock in the morning. Go to bed,

and now a word or two of comfort.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold received a letter from her mama ye&s;|terday.
She ran to me with it open in her hand, her
expre&s;&s;ive features all lit up with joy. Your mama
and your &s;i&s;ter are coming home, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I.
She changed her countenance in an in&s;tant, and
&s;haking her head, I wi&s;h they were, &s;he replied, but
they don't think of returning this month or &s;ix weeks.
I thought by your joyful countenance, my dear, that
we &s;hould have had them here in two or three days.
No, &s;he an&s;wered, folding the letter up to put it into
her pocket, her cheeks glowing with blu&s;hes, I am
only rejoiced to hear from them, and to find that&mdash;
That what? Shew me the letter, Dolly; you brought
it to me with that de&s;ign, I am &s;ure, what has
altered your intentions? You are a &s;trange girl,
Mi&s;s Audley; I did bring it on purpo&s;e to &s;hew you,
and if I looked plea&s;ed, it was only becau&s;e my
mama commended me. Commended you, for what,
my dear? How can you be &s;o teazing, Sophy?
There&mdash;take the letter&mdash;She to&s;&s;ed it to me, and
ran out of the room.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold &s;ays in it, &startq;I rejoice with you, my
love, on the recovery of our Orlando, and thank
you for your tender care of a life &s;o precious to
us all. Indeed I knew not how <HI>very</HI> dear he was
to me, till convinced by my fears (with which my
fir&s;t ha&s;ty peru&s;al of your letter had alarmed me)
<PB N="41" REF="43">
for his pre&s;ervation. It was very prudent as well
as very kind in Mr. Price to conceal the danger
from me till it was pa&s;t; I &s;hould certainly have
flown to you on the in&s;tant I heard the news.
Pray, do not &s;uffer your brother to return to col|lege
till his &s;trength is perfectly re&s;tored. Dolly, I
wi&s;h for life only to &s;ee my children happy. Falk|land
is one of my children; there may be ties
clo&s;e as if knit by the hand of nature, and I have
the &s;ame parental affection for this boy as if he
were really my &s;on. Had I been ble&s;&s;ed with one,
I &s;hould have wi&s;hed him ju&s;t &s;uch a youth as Or|lando.&endq;
She then proceeds to comfort her daughter
in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, under the mortification of be|ing
ab&s;ent from her mama and &s;i&s;ter, added to the
anxiety and trouble of attending a &s;ick room.&mdash;Com|plains
of the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he is under of remaining, ac|cording
to her promi&s;e, five or &s;ix weeks longer with
lady V&mdash;, on who&s;e deep melancholy &s;he expatiates,
and which, &s;he &s;ays, nothing but <HI>her</HI> conver&s;ati$n
&s;eems to alleviate. She tells Dolly &s;he would &s;end
for her to Burnly, but that &s;he thinks after the fa|tigue
of mind and body which &s;he has already under|gone,
that the dejection which reigns in lady V&mdash;'s
hou&s;e would contribute to depre&s;s, rather than relieve
her tender &s;pirits; and adds, that if it were not for
Cecilia's con&s;tant chearfulne&s;s and humour, <HI>&s;he her|&s;elf</HI>
could hardly &s;upport it. She concludes with tel|ling
her, that if lady Audley will be &s;o good as to
let Mi&s;s continue at Woodberry till her (Mrs.
Arnold's) return, &s;he &s;hall take it as a particular fa|vour,
as &s;he is &s;ure my company will be a great
con&s;olation to her poor daughter.</P>
<P>I fancy, Edward, it will not be a very difficult
matter to prevail on lady Audley to grant her this
favour. Do you know that my mama had intended
to have made the offer her&s;elf, &s;he tells me &s;o in a
note I received from her this day; but I am glad &s;he
is anticipated. The propo&s;al &s;hall now come from
Mi&s;s Arnold, and my &s;tay &s;hall be con&s;idered as a
compliment. Is it not &s;trange that Mrs. Arnold, &s;o
<PB N="42" REF="44">
prudent, &s;o cautious, and &s;o penetrating as &s;he &s;eems
to be, &s;hould &s;o widely have mi&s;taken the character
and de&s;igns of a certain friend of ours? Poor woman
how blind the&s;e <HI>very</HI> good folks are! She has even
now, without knowing it, &s;truck the arrow (into a
heart already pierced) at lea&s;t an inch deeper than it
was before! With what fondne&s;s does &s;he expre&s;s
her&s;elf, with what warmth does &s;he prai&s;e the already
too much beloved Falkland! This was the part of
her letter with which Dolly was &s;o much delighted;
and yet the little &s;impleton would fain have per&s;uaded
<HI>her&s;elf,</HI> as well as me, that &s;he was plea&s;ed only be|cau&s;e
her mother commended her. She entered the
room &s;oon after I had done reading the letter, the
prettie&s;t anxiety in the world in her face, and taking
me by the hand, You'll &s;tay with me, my dear Sophy,
till my mama comes home? Sure lady Audley will
be &s;o kind as to indulge me with your company! No
doubt, my dear, if you make the reque&s;t in Mrs.
Arnold's name I will write to her lady&s;hip immedi|ately,
replied &s;he&mdash;you had a note from her to-day,
I am afraid &s;he recalls you home, and I &s;hall be left
quite alone! Do you reckon Mr. Falkland <HI>nobody?</HI>
&s;aid I; I thought we had always allowed him to be
<HI>&s;omebody.</HI> She forced a reluctant &s;mile, her cheeks
again &s;tained with crim&s;on. He talks of going away
this evening.&mdash;A &s;igh, which &s;he endeavoured to
&s;uppre&s;s, divided the la&s;t word. And will you let
him, Dolly? Does not your mama charge you not
to &s;uffer him to depart till he is perfectly recovered?
Mr. Price &s;ays he is very well, &s;he an&s;wered, neither
does he him&s;elf complain; I would not detain him
for the world. How ridiculous are your &s;cruples,
my dear! mind what your mama &s;ays. I had Mrs.
Arnold's letter &s;till in my hand; I read over the
whole paragraph relative to Falkland, I read it with
good accent and good di&s;cretion. Oh, Edward, you
can't imagine what advantage tho&s;e few lines received
from the noble energy with which I enforced Mrs.
Arnold's favourable expre&s;&s;ions! Agreeably as Dolly
had been impre&s;&s;ed by them before, they now opera|ted
<PB N="43" REF="45">
with double force. <HI>There may be ties clo&s;e as if
knit by the hand of nature!</HI> No doubt there may, &s;aid
I, pau&s;ing, with a look as if I were con&s;idering.&mdash;
There is &s;omething my&s;terious to me in the&s;e words
&mdash;<HI>I have the &s;ame parental affection for this boy, as if
he were really my &s;on; and had I been ble&s;&s;ed with one,
I &s;hould have wi&s;hed him ju&s;t &s;uch a youth as Orlando.&mdash;</HI>
Is it not in her power then, continued I, to give
him the <HI>relation</HI> as well as the <HI>name</HI> of &s;on? Mrs. Ar|nold
can her&s;elf form a tie <HI>clo&s;e as if knit by the hand
of nature.</HI>&mdash;Ay, it mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;now I under&s;tand
her meaning, and let me die if I don't think &s;he her|&s;elf
wi&s;hes it at the bottom of her heart, though the
cruel ill-grounded prejudices of the world have
thrown a bar in the way, which your mama, from a
way of thinking a little too much confined (pardon
me the expre&s;&s;ion, Dolly) has not courage enough to
leap over.&mdash;Suppo&s;e that &s;he were to know that this
Orlando, <HI>&s;o precious to you all</HI> is particularly &s;o to <HI>one</HI>
of her family, don't you think in that ca&s;e &s;o indul|gent
a mother&mdash;Good God! interrupted Mi&s;s
Arnold, clapping her hands before her face, whither
are you running? You rave, Sophy, you talk of im|po&s;&s;ibilities!
Oh no, no, no, &s;ay no more, &s;ay no
more, I conjure you,&mdash;I &s;aw the tears trickling
down between her fingers. 'Tis the intere&s;t I take
in what &s;o nearly concerns your happine&s;s, my dear
Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid I, that makes me talk thus; can
you be angry with me for wi&s;hing to &s;ee your heart
at ea&s;e? Vain, vain wi&s;h! &s;aid &s;he, drying her eyes,
yet I thank you for it; I know it proceeds from your
love to me, (&s;he threw one of her arms round my
neck) yet I am &s;ure, were you in my place, you
would act ju&s;t as I intend to do.&mdash;And how is that,
my dear? To keep from all the world, except perhaps
&s;uch a faithful friend as your&s;elf, the knowledge of a
&s;ecret which terrifies me every time I think of it&mdash;
And why terrify you, Dolly? Is there a crime in
loving? Not in the thing it&s;elf, &s;he replied; but
to <HI>me</HI> 'tis the crime of our fir&s;t parents, 'tis
the &s;in of di&s;obedience. Yet the forbidden fruit is
<PB N="44" REF="46">
&s;o tempting, Dolly! po&s;itively, if I were not your
friend, I &s;hould be your rival, for I do think Falk|land
a bewitching creature. What eyes the toad has!
And yet (withdrawing her arm from my neck) <HI>you</HI>
would not have him your&s;elf, Mi&s;s Audley, were you
circum&s;tanced as I am. Upon my life I would, if I
had &s;uch an independent fortune as you have. What,
(with a look of &s;urprize mingled with curio&s;ity) con|trary
to your mama's approbation? I do not ab&s;o|lutely
&s;ay that neither; I have as great a re&s;pect for
parental authority (and I kept my face admirably)
as you can have, Mi&s;s Arnold, and therefore I &s;hould
certainly <HI>try</HI> to obtain my mama's con&s;ent, and if &s;he
would not grant it, why then&mdash;Ay, what would
become of you then, Mi&s;s Audley?&mdash;Why then,
I think I &s;hould be very apt to marry him without it.
&mdash;Mercy on me, Sophy, how madly you talk! but
I am &s;ure you are not &s;erious.&mdash;Why no, in that
ca&s;e I believe I &s;hould be as much afraid to venture
on &s;uch a &s;tep as you would, for I &s;hould think a
parent's refu&s;al of con&s;ent amounted to a prohibi|tion,
and I &s;hould look upon it as a downright act
of rebellion in that child who &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s &s;uch
a prohibition. A &s;ti&s;led &s;igh which I &s;aw li&s;ting her
gentle bo&s;om at that word, encouraged me to pro|ceed.&mdash;But
I'll &s;uppo&s;e matters &s;ituated with me,
ju&s;t as they are with you; I will &s;uppo&s;e my mama
to be as fond of Mr. Falkland as Mrs. Arnold is:
I'll &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he has but one &s;ingle objection to
the giving him her daughter, and that objection by
no means to be charged on him as a fault, and that
&s;he her&s;elf would overlook it, if it were not through
fear of the cen&s;ures of medaling impertinent people,
and the re&s;entment of an imperious brother: I hus
circum&s;tanced, I own I &s;hould not think it any great
outrage again&s;t duty, if without hazarding a denial
from my mother, I took the man I loved, and tru&s;ted
to her tenderne&s;s to forgive a little tre&s;pa&s;s, which
had not amounted to a breach or her commands.
There was a little &s;ophi&s;try in this rea&s;oning, Ed|ward;
I learnt that knack from you. Mi&s;s Arnold
<PB N="45" REF="47">
however &s;aw it not, at lea&s;t &s;he was too much agita|ted
by the tendency of my di&s;cour&s;e to examine it.
You talk of but <HI>one</HI> objection &s;aid &s;he; oh, Sophy,
you don't know what you are &s;aying! I know of
none, &s;aid I, but the un'ucky circum&s;tance of poor
Mr. Falkland's birth, which has been pa&s;&s;ed by in
hundreds who have not half his merit; for with re|&s;pect
to his want of fortune, where there will be &s;o
con&s;iderable a one on your &s;ide, 'tis too mean a con|&s;ideration
to be balanced with &s;o many good quali|ties,
&s;o many accompli&s;hments, &s;o amiable a per&s;on.
&mdash;Dear, dear Mi&s;s Audley, <HI>how</HI> can you talk thus?
Why, is it not all true? I grant it; but indeed your
kind zeal for me tran&s;ports you beyond the bounds of
rea&s;on; you forget that all this while, the man of
whom we are &s;peaking, never once dreamed of tho&s;e
chimeras which you have been conjuring up in your
own imagination&mdash;Ha, ha! and is <HI>that</HI> the rub
then? Oh, child, it &s;hall &s;oon be removed, our
bowls &s;han't be &s;topped by a &s;traw.&mdash;You don't
&s;uppo&s;e, Edward, I &s;aid this to Dolly; have not you
been corre&s;ponding with me long enough to know
the difference between a little mental parler that I
&s;ometimes hold with my&s;elf, and a re&s;pon&s;e made
aloud? I an&s;wered Mi&s;s Arnold, He mu&s;t be very
in&s;en&s;ible then, and I believe <HI>that</HI> is one of the la&s;t
faults that we &s;hould &s;u&s;pect in Falkland's nature.
No, Dolly, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, if he never did before,
he mu&s;t in this la&s;t vi&s;it have di&s;covered enough of
your &s;entiments to encourage his hope.</P>
<P>She &s;huddered when I &s;aid this, as one does at the
&s;ight of a little noxious animal to which we have
an antipathy. Lord, Mi&s;s Audley, how mean mu&s;t
I appear in your eyes! And if I &s;hould do &s;o too in
tho&s;e of Mr. Falkland!&mdash;She clapped her hands to|gether,
Oh, Sophy, I am not a match for that
reflection; I do not wi&s;h to be beloved; but indeed
I could not bear to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he &s;poke this, we heard &s;ome one tap at the
door, (we were in the garden parlour) May I come
in, ladies? &s;aid Falkland, for it was he. Mi&s;s Ar|nold
<PB N="46" REF="48">
was too much di&s;compo&s;ed to &s;ee him; &s;he ran
into the adjoining room, and I bid him come in.</P>
<P>I thought Mi&s;s Arnold had been with you, Ma|dam,
&s;aid he, and I came to bid you both good|bye,&mdash;You
are not going away now, Sir? Yes, he
replied, Mr. Price dines at Oxford to day, and he
thinks I may as well take the opportunity of going in
the chariot with him, as defer it till evening when I
purpo&s;ed to have gone.</P>
<P>My zeal for your intere&s;ts, Edward, made me
cruel in that in&s;tant; I did an ill-natured thing, for
without giving poor Dolly time to recompo&s;e her&s;elf,
I called her out of the other room, from whence,
as the door &s;tood on the jar, &s;he had heard what was
&s;aid. She entered; I pitied her from my heart, for
&s;he looked as pale as death. Orlando took her kindly
by the hand, What's the matter, my dear Arney?
(for &s;o he &s;ometimes calls her) no ill news from
Burnly, I hope! (he knew &s;he had received a letter)
how does your mama and Cecilia do? They are
very well, &s;he replied, but I am my&s;elf a little in|di&s;po&s;ed
to day. Poor Dolly, &s;aid Falkland, and
&s;lightly ki&s;&s;ed one of her cheeks; this ea&s;y familiar
action &s;oon cha&s;ed away the palene&s;s from them,
He looked earne&s;tly at her, 'Tis your too clo&s;e at|tendance
on me, &s;aid he, that has made you ill; it
were better a hundred &s;uch worthle&s;s fellows as I am
&s;hould die, than that you &s;hould lo&s;e an hour's
health. 'Tis only her want of &s;leep, &s;aid I; &s;he will
be well again in a day or two. I hope &s;o, replied Falk|land;
I &s;hall call on you again &s;oon. Adieu, and
pray be well again&s;t I &s;ee you next. Good morn|ing
to you, Mi&s;s Audley have you any commands to
Sir Edward? He made to each of us a graceful bow
and retired, and we &s;aw the chariot drive away with
him and Mr. Price in it pre&s;ently after.</P>
<P>Poor Mi&s;s Arnold! Lord! Edward, it is a &s;ad
thing to be in love without being &s;ure of a return,
for that is at pre&s;ent our ca&s;e: not that I can have
the lea&s;t doubt of Falkland's catching the flame if
it be communicated by a &s;kilful hand; but to tell you
<PB N="47" REF="49">
the truth, I have not ob&s;erved any thing in him
which gives me room to believe he loves her; yet
I may be mi&s;taken, and he may have art enough
to conceal his inclinations, where there appears &s;o
little probability of their &s;ucceeding. She &s;eems
now glad that he is gone, and has be&s;ought me
not to talk of him. In this I mu&s;t conform to
her de&s;ires, or perhaps forfeit her good opinion,
without which nothing can be effected. It now
re&s;ts upon you to make Falkland &s;peak for him|&s;elf,
and I think I can an&s;wer for the con&s;equen|ces.</P>
<P>We are at pre&s;ent mo&s;t intolerably humdrumi&s;h;
and if I were not the be&s;t &s;i&s;ter in the univer&s;e, I
&s;hould leave Dolly to read Homilies to old Price,
and return home; though, by the way, my mama
has <HI>permitted</HI> me (for we writ to her) to &s;tay here
till Mrs. Arnold's return.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>VERY near &s;inking, by Jupiter! If I had not
been a &s;kilful &s;eaman, and cried <HI>'bout &s;hip</HI> in an
in&s;tant, we had gone &s;ouce to the bottom! You have
an excellent no&s;e, Sophy, to u&s;e a &s;port&s;man's phra&s;e,
and can &s;cent out a little lurking Cupid as well as my
Ba&s;to can a hare. You were right with regard to
Mi&s;s Arnold, you are right with regard to Falkland,
for he not only does <HI>not</HI> love Dorothy; but as fortune
in her &s;pite would have it, he <HI>loves</HI> Cecilia! Thanks
be to my better &s;tars I am not dying for either of the
puppets, yet I <HI>will</HI> have one of them; and &s;ince my
heart has been &s;o amenable to me as to turn out Dol|ly
to make room for Cecilia, why &s;hould not Falk|land's
be the &s;ame, and turn out Cecilia to make room
<PB N="48" REF="50">
for her older &s;i&s;ter? Ay, it mu&s;t be &s;o, the change is
ea&s;y, and it will be &s;o extremely convenient to us all,
that I will have it &s;o; but Falkland mu&s;t not yet
know my de&s;ign, for on that depends its &s;ucce&s;s,
though I had like to have betrayed it, which would
have blown us all up.</P>
<P>Have you ever &s;een two children at play, Sophy,
delighted with the &s;ports in which they were engag|ed,
and galloping in full career round the room on
hobby-hor&s;es? One of them, tired perhaps of his
pa&s;time, &s;pies &s;ome toy that was put up on a &s;helf,
probably to be out of both their reaches; he climbs
to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, which the other brat no &s;oon|er
perceives, than he immediately di&s;mounts, and no|thing
will &s;erve him but the identical bauble of his
companion; he &s;qualls for it directly, Waugh, Sir,
it was mine fir&s;t, and they fall in&s;tantly to &s;cratching.
Thus would it have fared between Falkland and me,
had he di&s;covered that I had any views with regard to
Cecilia; for though he never yet entertained the mo&s;t
di&s;tant thought of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing either of tho&s;e girls, and
con&s;idered them, like the toy on the &s;helf, as things
entirely out of his reach; yet had he &s;een an adven|turous
rival &s;tretch forth his arm to &s;eize the prize,
good bye to hobby-hor&s;es, nothing would &s;erve him
but my play thing.</P>
<P>I'll tell you what pa&s;&s;ed between us ye&s;terday.
Falkland, &s;aid I, I am a&s;toni&s;hed that you, who have
had &s;uch opportunities have not endeavoured to carry
off one of the Mi&s;s Arnolds. To carry <HI>off!</HI> &s;aid
he, with &s;ome &s;urprize. Ay, her heart I mean, cri|ed
I, for then you may be &s;ure her per&s;on will &s;oon
follow. You are mi&s;taken, Sir Edward, an&s;wered he;
their mother has in&s;tilled into them &s;uch notions of
perfection, that they hardly think them&s;elves mortal
women, and I dare &s;ay, nothing under a demi-god
would be thought worthy of them. I laugh'd, and
an&s;wer'd, Yet I will lay five hundred pounds. Falk|land,
that had I been under the &s;ame roof with them
half as long as you have been, one of them &s;hould
<PB N="49" REF="51">
have de&s;cended from her coele&s;tial &s;tilts, and been la|dy
Audley by this time.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a little, then a&s;ked me which of them
would have been my choice? Cecilia, an&s;wered I,
(po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that Dolly <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be his) Ceci|lia!
he repeated eagerly, his face all in a flame. I
quickly &s;aw how the land lay, and with an inimitable
pre&s;ence of mind, Would &s;he not be your's? cried I.
I think her a much finer girl than her &s;i&s;ter; the
<HI>younge&s;t</HI> is a mere baby face. He laughed now in his
turn, and re-compo&s;ing his features, Faith, Sir Ed|ward,
you &s;tartled me, &s;aid he; why the <HI>younge&s;t</HI> is
Cecilia, for whom, had I preten&s;ions to <HI>either</HI> of them,
I own I would give my life. I <HI>could</HI> love Cecilia
dearly, and though I have hitherto &s;tifled a hopele&s;s
&s;lame, I find the thoughts of a rival would make it
blaze out. There, Sophy, you &s;ee he gave proof
to my &s;imile.</P>
<P>Falkland, replied I, with a very &s;erious countenance,
I could tell you a &s;ecret that a certain little bird has
whi&s;pered to me? but &s;ince I know your &s;entiments,
I had better keep it to my&s;elf. What is it? prithee,
tell it me. Poh, what does it &s;ignify, I'll only tell
you that <HI>I</HI> would give a limb to be as happy a man as
you are without your knowing your own good for|tune
&mdash;I'll never forgive you, Sir Edward, if you
conceal it.&mdash;But I promi&s;ed my &s;i&s;ter not to
&s;peak of it.&mdash;And you never broke your promi&s;e
to a lady? Ay, but this is a different cafe.&mdash;You
may keep your &s;ecret, Sir Edward, but I &s;han't look
upon you any longer as my <HI>friend.</HI> Suppo&s;e I &s;hould
tell you that Mi&s;s Arnold loves an in&s;en&s;ible blind fel|low
that never once thought of her! He appeared
thunder-&s;truck. Mi&s;s Arnold! do you mean Dolly
or Cecilia, for you don't &s;eem to know one from the
other? I mean her whom my &s;i&s;ter is now with, &s;he
who I think the hand&s;ome&s;t, Dolly, if that be her
name. Why you amaze me, Sir Edward! What did
Mi&s;s Audley &s;ay to you? Coxcomb, &s;aid I, you
want to indulge your vanity now, by hearing at &s;e|cond
hand the &s;oft confe&s;&s;ions of one of the fine&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="52">
creatures in the univer&s;e. Not replied he, for upon
my word (I <HI>can</HI> not yet get him to &s;wear a little de|cently)
if you are &s;erious in what you &s;ay, I am ex|tremely
&s;orry for it. Oh could you but have told me
this of Cecilia! 'Tis a pity, cried I, that <HI>both</HI> the
girls are not in love with you; why what a tyrant art
thou, Falkland, for if that were the ca&s;e, one of
them <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be unhappy.&mdash;You mi&s;take me, an&s;wered
he; I only wi&s;h that Cecilia had for me tho&s;e &s;enti|ments
which you &s;ay her &s;i&s;ter has; for then&mdash;What
then, Falkland? Why then perhaps both you and I
&mdash;but it is all madne&s;s to think of it. We can nei|ther
of us pretend to them, your <HI>fortune</HI> does not en|title
you; and for my part, born as I am under an
anathema, I never dur&s;t entertain a hope. I have a
thou&s;and obligations to Mrs. Arnold and I &s;hould
think it a violation of the laws of gratitude and ho&s;|pitality,
&s;hould I endeavour to &s;educe the heart of
her daughter.</P>
<P>I did not like this &s;train, Sophy, it favoured too
much of old Price. Yet, &s;aid I, you wi&s;hed but now,
that Cecilia had for you tho&s;e &s;entiments that her &s;i&s;|ter
has. I fancy in that ca&s;e, Falkland, you would
make a little free with the laws of ho&s;pitality. At pre|&s;ent
you are mightily inclined to impo&s;e on your&s;elf
for <HI>virtue,</HI> what is in reality nothing more than <HI>indif|ference.</HI>
Suppo&s;e it were Cecilia who loved you,
would you not hazard every thing, forfeit every thing
to po&s;&s;e&s;s her? I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with the
thought! &s;aid he. That an&s;wers me fully, replied
I; where then is the difference between breaking
through forms (for that would be <HI>the very head and
front of your offending)</HI> with a view to gratify your
own pa&s;&s;ion, and the doing &s;o in order to make a
grateful return to that of a fair lady? In one cafe,
&s;aid he, the temptation would be &s;ome excu&s;e. And
in the other, cried I, the motive, would be a much
better. I admire Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid he, I love, I e&s;|teem
her; yet I never con&s;idered her in the light you
mention. Cecilia had early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my inclina|tions,
and I had always thought &s;he loved me better
<PB N="51" REF="53">
than her &s;i&s;ter did. This it was, perhaps, which
helped to conciliate my affections more to her. You
&s;ee how wrong a judgment you formed, an&s;wered I;
you were led into this error for want of being better
acquainted with the female heart Cecilia, who felt
nothing more for you than friend&s;hip, or at mo&s;t a
<HI>&s;i&s;terly</HI> love, gave full &s;cope to tho&s;e feelings, and as
&s;he had no rea&s;on to hide, &s;he let you fee <HI>all</HI> that pa&s;|&s;ed
in her heart. Poor Dolly, on the contrary, con|&s;cious
that &s;he felt more for you than &s;he dared to a|vow,
was always on her guard, and for fear of di&s;|covering
the <HI>whole,</HI> perhaps concealed more than &s;he
needed to have done.</P>
<P>I believe you are right, &s;aid he; a thou&s;and little
circum&s;tances now occur to me, which convince me
that you are. There was &s;omething very particular
in Mi&s;s Arnold's behaviour when I took my leave of
her ye&s;terday. Poor girl, what a pity!&mdash;What a
pity indeed, cried I, that &s;he &s;hould love an in&s;en&s;ible
puppy that does not de&s;erve her! and I &s;wore a furi|ous
oath at him. What would you have me do, cri|ed
he, would it not be ba&s;ely betraying Mi&s;s Arnold
to pretend a pa&s;&s;ion which I do not feel? And would
it not al&s;o be betraying my own intere&s;ts, for in that
ca&s;e I mu&s;t for ever give up all thoughts of Cecilia?
Dolt, cried I, have you any <HI>hopes</HI> of her? At pre&s;ent
not the lea&s;t, an&s;wered he, yet time might do &s;ome|thing
in my favour. I build much on Mrs. Arnold's
tenderne&s;s for me; and were Cecilia to favour my
wi&s;hes, I think I &s;hould even venture to di&s;clo&s;e them
to her mother.&mdash;And be &s;ure of a di&s;appoint|ment,
interrupted I; no, no, Falkland, though a
heart in love may overlook a thou&s;and inequalities, a
parent's cooler judgment never can.&mdash;Would there
not then, &s;aid he, be the &s;ame difficulty with regard
to one &s;i&s;ter as to the other? Undoubtedly, cried I,
if the mother were to be con&s;ulted on the occa&s;ion.
&mdash;He was thoughtful for a while, then repeated with
a &s;igh, Poor Mi&s;s Arnold!</P>
<P>I dropp'd the conver&s;ation here, not-thinking it
convenient at that time to urge the &s;ubject farther.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
I have &s;tudied Falkland minutely &s;ince I have
been acquainted with him, and find he is of a ve|ry
mixed character. The father and the mother pretty
equally blended in his compo&s;ition; but I hope the
latter may predominate, el&s;e even under <HI>my</HI> prudent
guidance and example, he may &s;neak out of the
world without <HI>doing</HI> any thing worthy of remembrance.
&startq;Tis harder to delineate the traces of this young man's
mind, than of any one's I have ever yet known. I
have &s;ometimes thought this proceeded from the &s;ame
cau&s;e that extremely delicate faces are the harde&s;t to
be drawn. He has no &s;trong lines in his foul, and if
I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, all the features of it are
faint. I do not think him capable of a manly or
&s;teady friend&s;hip towards one of his own &s;ex, or of a
violent or con&s;tant attachment towards one of your's;
yet is he the mo&s;t engaging and agreeable companion
in the world among&s;t men, and would, (to a woman)
I dare &s;ay, appear a warm and &s;incere lover. He
likes plea&s;ure, yet enters not into it with that juve|nile
ardour &s;o natural to one of his age; he even
&s;ometimes commits exce&s;&s;es, but it &s;eems as if he
were led into them more from the force of example,
than the &s;trength of his pa&s;&s;ions. He is at times idle
without being di&s;&s;ipated, and at others bu&s;y without
being &s;tudious. He will deny no favour that you can
a&s;k of him; yet he appears not much obliged for tho&s;e
which are granted to him. In &s;hort, he does the be&s;t
and the wor&s;t things with equal indifference. He
loves expence, yet he by no means de&s;pi&s;es money;
and I have &s;een him generous and niggardly in the
&s;ame hour; ha&s;ty in forming re&s;olutions, and as rea|dy
to break them. He has an infinite deal of vanity;
but he has &s;till more art in concealing it; and I be|lieve
that I am the fir&s;t who ever di&s;covered that he
had either. With all this he has very good &s;en&s;e, and
an addre&s;s in&s;inuating beyond any thing I ever met
with. His faults &s;eem all complexional, &s;o are his
virtues too, for he is neither right nor wrong upon
principle, and it appears a moot point whether nature
intended him for an angel or a devil. Such is the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
&s;ubject I have to work upon. His old tutor (whom,
he &s;ays, be believes to be as good a man as Abraham
was) has endeavoured to in&s;till into him all his patri|archal
notions; a few of them have &s;tuck by him,
and it has co&s;t me a good deal of pains to root out
others; but I mu&s;t clear the ground entirely of weeds,
for &s;uch I con&s;ider prejudices of all kinds, and then
I think I can &s;ow it with what feeds I plea&s;e.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t came to college he was very unto|wardly,
and, to &s;ay the truth, I had not much hopes
of him. Nay &s;till, &s;pight of all my digging and hoeing
and raking, a weed now and then pops up; he relap&s;|es
into his ab&s;urd opinions, and this he calls a return
to <HI>virtue;</HI> but this is generally after a night's debauch,
when finding perhaps his head ach next morning, he
<HI>declares</HI> he'll never drink again, &s;huts him&s;elf up in his
chamber for three days, and I verily believe &s;ays his
prayers. I commonly lettho&s;e penitential fits work
off, as I would tho&s;e of an ague, and then I apply my
remedy; by which means I hope in time to effect an
ab&s;olute cure. His con&s;cience &s;eems to be troubled
with an intermitting fever, but I perceive already the
returns of it are le&s;s frequent, and the paroxy&s;ms of a
&s;horter duration.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that Mrs. Arnold has a high opi|nion
of him; per&s;ons who are endowed with a plau|&s;ible
exterior, and who are not agitated by violent
pa&s;&s;ions, may impo&s;e on more di&s;cerning eyes than
generally fall to the &s;hare of ingenuous minds. Let
this account for what you &s;eem &s;o much &s;urprized at
in your la&s;t letter, viz. that Mrs. Arnold, with all her
penetration, could never fee into the character and
de&s;igns of a <HI>certain friend</HI> of ours; whom, in all com|panies,
&s;he declares to be the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of women! Don't
you know that old Price is her almoner to di&s;po&s;e of
her little private charities? Then his conver&s;ation is
<HI>&s;o</HI> edifying! Lord, what would <HI>&s;he</HI> give to have &s;uch
a worthy divine under the fame roof with her! 'Tis
true her lady&s;hip has the misfortune of having a rake|helly
young fellow to her &s;on, but what then? The
worthie&s;t of parents may have, wild children; be&s;ides,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
Sir Edward is very young, he <HI>may</HI> reform, and yet
make an excellent man. Oh, no doubt, if it plea&s;es
heaven to make &s;uch a reformation.&mdash;Mean while
poor lady Audley <HI>di&s;countenances</HI> him as much as po&s;|&s;ible,
and even very rarely allows him to vi&s;it her.
Such a conduct may be thought &s;omewhat rigorous by
tender mothers, 'tis true, but for <HI>her</HI> part &s;he &s;hould
always prefer her <HI>duty</HI> to her feelings.&mdash;Now,
Sophy, do you wonder any longer? But to return to
our own affairs. I think 'tis meet that Mi&s;s Arnold &s;hould
he per&s;uaded that Falkland loves her. You are very
good at &s;tarting a hint, but I am your only operator
to improve upon it. I therefore &s;end you a pretty
maidenly epi&s;tle inclo&s;ed, which you may let your
friend &s;ee in whatever manner your di&s;cretion &s;hall
direct. You mu&s;t in return write me a letter fit for
Falkland's eye. I will not affront your &s;agacity by
enlarging on the utility of this &s;tep; I &s;hall only re|mind
you that it will give me an opportunity of
renewing a conver&s;ation, which I could not well be
the fir&s;t to re-a&s;&s;ume, without creating &s;ome &s;u&s;pi|cions
of a de&s;ign.&mdash;Sophy, I mu&s;t &s;ucceed in

<P>YOU reproach me, my dear Sophy, for ab&s;enting
my&s;elf from Woodberry. Falkland was punc|tual
in delivering to me your menaces; but you ought
rather to commend my caution than to blame my
coldne&s;s. I love you, and I re&s;pect Mi&s;s Arnold;
but I owe &s;omething to my own peace, and therefore
think it prudent not to indulge inclination where hope
is forbid. The unhappy, they &s;ay, find relief in the
&s;ociety of tho&s;e who are as mi&s;erable as them&s;elves;
if this be &s;o, I have at lea&s;t one con&s;olation, for I find
I am not the only wretch who mu&s;t &s;igh in vain. Your
<PB N="55" REF="57">
tyrant friend <HI>has</HI> a lover, though perhaps &s;he little
&s;u&s;pects it, of whom the prou $e&s;t of her &s;ex might
boa&s;t! but he &s;hall never grace her triumphs. Hope|le&s;s
of &s;ucce&s;s, he has hitherto wi&s;ely concealed his
love; nor &s;hould even <HI>I</HI> have di&s;covered it, if I had
not made him the confidant of my own; then it was
he frankly acknowledged him&s;elf to be a fellow &s;uf|ferer.
Sophy, I tru&s;t you with a &s;ecret that you mu&s;t
not let tran&s;pire. Falkland, poor Falkland, (ea&s;y and
chearful as you have always &s;een him) pines in &s;ecret
for that&mdash;I won't call her names, yet I could
hate her for her hypocri&s;y. Yes, Sophy, &s;he is a hy|pocrite,
for who that looks in her face would think
her cold or in&s;en&s;ible? Yet I do not &s;o much blame
<HI>her,</HI> as I do Mrs. Arnold. Her mi&s;taken zeal for the
pre&s;ervation of Falkland's morals, has expo&s;ed his
heart to inevitable evil. How was it po&s;&s;ible for him
<HI>not</HI> to lo$e, and is it not next to a miracle that he is
not beloved again? I own to you fairly, had I known
the &s;tate of his heart &s;ooner, Mi&s;s Arnold &s;hould ne|ver
have enrolled <HI>my</HI> name among&s;t the li&s;t of her
&s;laves.</P>
<P>Had he hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hould envy, and per|haps
love him le&s;s; but I could not be villain enough
to endeavour to &s;upplant him, as I con&s;ider his claim
as of elder birth than my own. At pre&s;ent we have
nothing to do but &s;it down and condole with each o|ther;
yet I wi&s;h I could per&s;uade him to follow my
example, and by diverting his thoughts with other
objects, try to turn them from that which now &s;o
much engro&s;&s;es them; but he is a romantick fool, &s;o
I mu&s;t leave him to his fate. For my part, I intend
to give my&s;elf but another week to whine like a dri|veller.
I will then, like a fierce demoniac, &s;nap my
chains at once, exorci&s;e the demon Love to quit mine
and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome other devoted brea&s;t, leav|ing

<OPENER>Mi&s;s AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 24th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CHARMING creature! incomparable brother!
how I envy you the glory of your contrivance!
It <HI>ought</HI> to have been <HI>mine;</HI> 'tis too good for any <HI>man</HI>
living. Had there been a word more, or a word le&s;s,
it would not have done: had you treated Mi&s;s Arnold
with more decorum, or been more guarded in your
expre&s;&s;ions, it would not have done; had you u&s;ed
more freedom, it would not have done; for then I could
not have let her &s;ee your letter; but you mixed your
ingredients to a nicety&punc; yet with all your &s;kill, it &s;till
would not have done, if it had not been for my dex|terity
in the application; for let a recipe be ever &s;o
well prepared, there may be a little &s;kill nece&s;&s;ary in
admini&s;tering the potion, or the patient may lo&s;e the
good effects of it.</P>
<P>I have taken three days to an&s;wer your <HI>maidenly</HI>
epi&s;tle, as you call it; (very maidenly it is, no doubt,
becau&s;e you did not &s;wear in it) for, you mu&s;t know,
Dolly did not &s;ee it till this very day, as I have been
ever &s;ince I received it pondering with my&s;elf in what
manner I could be&s;t communicate it to her. Falk|land's
<HI>name</HI> was not to be mentioned: I could not,
therefore, infringe this her <HI>command,</HI> without her real|ly
<PB N="57" REF="59">
being, or affecting to be, di&s;plea&s;ed at it; and this
might have produced &s;ome con&s;equences not at all
de&s;irable.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, therefore, your letter mu&s;t have been ab|ruptly
introduced, under an apparent breach too of
the confidence you repo&s;ed in me. Chance &s;ome|times
does for us what neither our own indu&s;try nor
art could effect. I actually dropped your letter, with|out
any de&s;ign, and Dolly, by the luckie&s;t hazard,
picked it up on the &s;tairs, where I had flirted it out
of my pocket with my handkerchief in going down.
She brought it to me directly, folded up as it was.
I no &s;ooner ca&s;t my eyes on it, than knowing it to be
yours, a mixture of &s;urprize and joy made the colour
mount up to my eyes, and, without knowing what I
did, I &s;napped it eagerly from her. So unaffected a
confu&s;ion could not fail of creating &s;ome &s;u&s;picion.
Ah, Sophy, cried Mi&s;s Arnold, I &s;ee we are not up|on
equal terms; you have &s;ecrets which you conceal
from me. You think this is from a lover, replied I;
indeed, my dear, you are mi&s;taken; 'tis only from my
brother.&mdash;Why that blu&s;h then, Sophy? why that
keen impatience to have it re&s;tored? Becau&s;e, &s;aid I,
(affecting a little of that embarra&s;&s;ment which I really
felt before) becau&s;e&mdash;look, this is his hand on
the &s;uper&s;cription&mdash;Becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;&s;aid
&s;he, &s;miling, how &s;hould I know Sir Edward's
hand? I'll &s;hew you his name at the bottom, at lea&s;t
the two fir&s;t letters of it. I unfolded the letter; &s;he
ob&s;erved the ver&s;es: Poetry, as I live! ah, little
di&s;&s;embler, 'tis not from your brother&mdash;See his
name at the bottom&mdash;There may be more E. A.'s
than Sir Edward Audley; you could not have been
&s;o agitated, had it come from him. I made her look
at the conclu&s;ion, doubling down the other parts.
She read, <HI>The pains of unrequited love.</HI> Sophy, this
cannot be from your brother. Why not, Dolly,? has
he not rea&s;on to complain of a certain per&s;on? This
&s;eemed to recover her from her doubts. I dare &s;ay,
&s;aid &s;he, he is very &s;evere upon me in it, which made
you &s;o unwilling that I &s;hould &s;ee it: prithee tell me
<PB N="58" REF="60">
what he &s;ays; for I can take nothing ill of &s;uch a
mad-cap. Well, &s;aid I, if you will promi&s;e not to
be angry, I will &s;hew it to you; though my brother
would never forgive me, were he to know it. I put
it into her hands. She &s;aw by the date it had been
written three days; and her manner of finding it,
joined to my behaviour, left her not the lea&s;t room to
&s;u&s;pect there was any artifice in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>She read it attentively. Here was a copy, Edward,
to have exerci&s;ed a painter's &s;kill; her ingenuous coun|tenance
&s;peaking all the various pa&s;&s;ions of her &s;oul. He
is right, &s;aid &s;he; perfectly right with a compo&s;ed look
and voice, as &s;he read the fir&s;t paragraph of your let|ter;
yet I &s;hould always be glad to fee Sir Edward as
a friend. I watched her as &s;he proceeded to the next,
where you &s;ay, <HI>The unhappy find relief,</HI> &amp;c. and I heard
her breathe a &s;igh, in pity even of thee, thou traitor.
Indeed, I am very &s;orry, &s;aid &s;he, her &s;oft eyes &s;till <HI>more</HI>
&s;oftened by compa&s;&s;ion, at the thoughts of your pre|tended
&s;ufferings. But now came the touch-&s;tone,
<HI>Your tyrant friend has a lover,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;aw &s;urpri&s;e, cu|rio&s;ity,
and impatience take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every feature;
&s;he &s;eemed to devour the lines with her eyes: but
when the name of <HI>Falkland</HI> &s;truck them, what a glow
then brightened her face! a blu&s;h is too poor a word;
I never &s;aw her look &s;o beautiful! Good God, &s;aid
&s;he, can this be po&s;&s;ible! She pau&s;ed a little, her eyes
beaming with lu&s;tre. She read on&mdash;A hypocrite, does
Sir Edward call me? how much does your brother
wrong me in his opinion! Sophy, you know I am nei-<HI>cold</HI>
nor <HI>in&s;en&s;ible.</HI> She returned to your letter; Poor
Falkland! dear Orlando! broke involuntarily from her
lips. Sir Edward blames my mama here, continued
&s;he; but how could &s;he fore&s;ee, that in her pious care
of an unhappy orphan, &s;he, was laying up mi&s;ery for
him, and her weak imprudent daughter? Yet I have
heard her &s;ay, that there was a fatality in all her
actions, and that her be&s;t de&s;igns had been perverted
into evil. It will be her own fault, &s;aid I, if this
&s;hould be rendered &s;o. She only &s;hook her head; when
<PB N="59" REF="61">
coming, to the conclu&s;ion of your letter, &s;he &s;miled, and
&s;aid, &s;he loved you for your &s;pirit in re&s;olving to think
no more of her; adding, that &s;he was very &s;ure you
would not find it difficult to keep your re&s;olution. I
replied, My brother has a very vulnerable heart;
at the &s;ame time he is &s;o volatile, that I &s;hould not be
&s;urprized if I were to &s;ee him in love with &s;ome one
el&s;e in a month or two; (I &s;aid this by way of a pre|paratory
&s;tep for your attack on Cecilia) yet, con|tinued
I, were he to meet a kind return, I know it
would fix him; and the plains of Arcadia never &s;aw a
renderer or a more con&s;tant &s;wain than Sir Edward
might then be made. There was a pretty &s;peech for
you! I hope, replied Mi&s;s Arnold, he may then &s;oon
meet with a lady who will de&s;erve and return his af|fection.
But let me now a&s;k you one que&s;tion, Sophy;
Have you written to your brother &s;ince you received
this letter? I &s;aw the tendency of her que&s;tion, and
was prepared with an an&s;wer; yet I he&s;itated as if I
were not. Have you written to Sir Edward? &s;he re|peated
&mdash;I have&mdash;Sophy, I fear, I fear you put too
much confidence in that brother of yours; yet, if you
have betrayed my &s;ecret!&mdash;I cla&s;ped my arms &s;ud|denly
about her neck&mdash;Dolly, I can't deceive you, yet
I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be forgiven; I will not loo&s;e my hold till you
promi&s;e me your pardon. What have you done?
cried &s;he eagerly; tell me quickly. I have tru&s;ted my
brother, &s;aid I, with a &s;ecret which I my&s;elf di&s;co|vered.
I am lo&s;t then! cried &s;he, flinging from me,
and throwing her&s;elf into another chair; Falkland by
this time knows it all! 'Twas barbarous in you, Sophy;
would I have u&s;ed you &s;o? My brother will not men|tion
it, &s;aid I; I charged him &s;trictly on that head.
O ridiculous &s;uppo&s;ition! cried &s;he; do you think that
<HI>men</HI> have more virtue than <HI>we</HI> have? Don't you &s;ee
that your friend&s;hip for me got the better of your &s;ide|lity
to your brother, and you communicated to me
what he charged you to conceal! I &s;eemed to be &s;truck
dumb with this reproach, and the truth of the ob&s;erva|tion
&mdash;but recovering my&s;elf; He has not the &s;ame rea|&s;ons
to excu&s;e a breach of tru&s;t, nor the &s;ame motives
<PB N="60" REF="62">
for committing it. I was overcome by your importu|nities;
and had you not found and pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee my
brother's letter, I &s;hould never have mentioned Falkland
to you more. The &s;ame accident cannot befal Sir Ed|ward;
what inducement then can he have to betray
me? This flim&s;y apology was (as I meant it &s;hould be)
very ea&s;ily an&s;wered. Friend&s;hip for Falkland, replied
&s;he: he loves him, and will be very glad of an op|portunity
of telling him what he thinks will make him
happy&mdash;Again I &s;tood in amaze at her &s;agacity! but
&s;till willing to excu&s;e my fault, I am extremely &s;orry,
&s;aid I, that I &s;hould have been &s;o imprudent; but I
don't know how it is, I never <HI>could</HI> keep any thing from
my brother&mdash;And I &s;poke it in the tone of one who is
a&s;hamed of their own ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>To what have you expo&s;ed me! cried &s;he, cla&s;ping
her hands together; how &s;hall I bear to look Falkland
in the face, after &s;uch an <HI>un&s;ollicited</HI> confe&s;&s;ion? Had
he remained ignorant of my weakne&s;s, time and my
own endeavours, joined to a belief of <HI>his</HI> indifference,
would have enabled me to overcome it; but now what
hope have I left? If Falkland, encouraged by what I
am &s;ure he knows too well, &s;hould venture to declare
him&s;elf, I am undone! Sophy, you know not what
thorns you have planted here&mdash;and &s;he laid her hands
on her bo&s;om. Accept of my penitence, my dear
Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid I, and hope for the be&s;t. I was
really affected with the account my brother gave me
of poor Falkland's &s;ituation: I thought <HI>he</HI> was &s;o too;
and (as he had no hopes him&s;elf) that the knowledge of
this &s;ecret would, far from creating any jealou&s;y in
him, rather be a con&s;olation, when he reflected that it
was not an <HI>unworthy</HI> rival to whom you gave the pre|ference.
Come, prithee, my dear, dry your eyes (for
I perceived tears in them) you are the fir&s;t woman, I
believe, that ever cried for finding her&s;elf adored by
the man &s;he loved. I don't weep for <HI>that&punc;</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
but to think how unhappy we mu&s;t <HI>both</HI> be. Had I &s;uf|fered
alone; but poor Orlando&mdash;mu&s;t be your hu&s;band
after all, Dolly. She &s;miled through her tears, and
&s;obbed out, A&mdash;h, Sophy, that's impo&s;&s;ible! A good
<PB N="61" REF="63">
deal more of pretty girli&s;h chit-chat pa&s;&s;ed between us,
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, till we were called down to &s;up|per,
where Mr. Price's pre&s;ence was a check to any
farther conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The family are all, long &s;ince retired to bed; and
here am I, like a witch &s;crawling dire characters at
midnight. My chamber joins that where Mi&s;s Arnold
&s;leeps; but where &s;he <HI>&s;leeps</HI> not at pre&s;ent, for I hear
her &s;ighing. The&s;e very re&s;erved girls, I have ob|&s;erved,
when they <HI>do</HI> love, love unmercifully. We
lively ones, with a little da&s;h of the coquet in us, are
mere babies to them. Another &s;igh! Oh, Edward,
the potion operates rarely!</P>
<P>Well, but all this while Falkland &s;teps not forward
to meet us. We are prepared for him here; and I
&s;hall have but a poor opinion of your abilities, if I do
not very &s;oon &s;ee a pair of <HI>mutual</HI> lovers. If you can
once bring him to unfold his heart a little, Dolly's will
expand of it&s;elf, and we may tru&s;t to &s;ympathy to do
the re&s;t; but it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to engage
him in the pur&s;uit of this amour before Cecilia's re|turn.
Once entered, he cannot retract; and the re|ception
he will be &s;ure to meet with, mu&s;t infallibly
fix him: for after all (putting romance out of the
que&s;tion) I believe he would ble&s;s his &s;tars to get either
of the&s;e girls.</P>
<P>I take it for granted he has not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion
that you ever made any overtures to Mi&s;s Arnold; on
which account, nothing will appear more natural than
that you &s;hould urge <HI>him,</HI> already &s;o much favoured,
to lay hold on his good fortune; be&s;ides the indifference
you expre&s;&s;ed towards Cecilia, will put him off his
guard there too; &s;o that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for doubts
of any kind to awaken his jealou&s;y: and once there
comes to be a reciprocation of vows between him and
his love, (for that I expect will &s;oon be the ca&s;e) he
cannot be &s;uch a &s;narling cur as to &s;tand between you
and a good to which he has given up all preten&s;ions.
Dolly, on the other hand, very probably, will not be
&s;orry to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter in the &s;ame predicament with her|&s;elf.
We are all Eves, brother, and are ready to
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;tretch out the apple to our friends of which we our|&s;elves
have ta&s;ted. You know Mrs. Arnold thinks her
daughters as &s;afe with my mama as with her&s;elf; we
&s;hall, therefore, have many opportunities, after they
return from Burnly, of making little parties at our own
hou&s;e, till the time appointed for the young ladies go|ing

&s;ecured her heart before &s;he leaves Woodberry. I am
quite tired with writing &s;o long a letter; yet I will not

<P>'TIS almo&s;t a fortnight &s;ince I have &s;een you, and
yet you are within five &s;hort miles of me.
Indeed, brother, you are very unkind, and I almo&s;t
begin to think you have no affection for me. You
ought to con&s;ider the melancholy life I lead here: I &s;ee
no body but a few primitive people whom Mrs. Ar|nold
has &s;elected for her acquaintance. As for poor
Dolly, &s;he is become &s;uch a mope, that &s;he is really
fit company for no one but her&s;elf; and if I did
not love her dearly, I would not &s;acrifice my hours
<PB N="63" REF="65">
to her. Poor dear creature! I pity her from my
heart.</P>
<P>Upon my word, Edward, I begin to be &s;eriou&s;ly
alarmed for her; for I think her health is daily im|pairing.
Would to God, &s;he had never known a cer|tain
friend of yours, or that he was in a &s;ituation that
would take off all objections to him; but as that is
never likely to be the ca&s;e, if you have any regard to
the peace of the family in which I now am, or &s;et any
value en my friend&s;hip, take care never to let drop the
&s;malle&s;t hint of what I intru&s;ted to your confidence;
for if any improper con&s;equences &s;hould en&s;ue (as no
doubt there would) I &s;hould certainly be &s;u&s;pected
by Mrs. Arnold as an abettor in her daughter's impru|dence;
for I know not to what lengths Dolly's uncon|querable
attachment might carry her, if Falkland were
to know and avail him&s;elf of it.</P>
<P>Her mama talks of &s;ending for her to Burnly, as &s;he
knows not when &s;he &s;hall be able to di&s;engage her&s;elf
from lady V&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;he would, as it would at the &s;ame
time help to divert <HI>her</HI> mind, and deliver me from a
confinement of which I am quite tired. Dolly does
not &s;eem to reli&s;h the thoughts of going; but I have a
great inclination to get my mama to write to Mrs.
Arnold to &s;end for her. She need only be told of that
melancholy which is preying on her mind, to hurry
her away directly. She will attribute it, no doubt, to
her being, for the fir&s;t time, ab&s;ent from her friends.
How much does poor Mi&s;s Arnold envy that little
&s;prightly gip&s;ey Cecilia! Mrs. Arnold &s;ays &s;he is the
life of the whole family at Burnly; and that her con|&s;tant
flow of &s;pirits &s;upports that of her mama, as well
as of Mrs. and Mi&s;s Darnley. Happy girl! &s;he is a
&s;tranger to that tyrant who commits &s;uch ravages in the
bo&s;om of her poor &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, Edward, &s;end me &s;ome books,
and &s;ome news. Tell me who and who's together at

good and bad, cram them into your budget, and

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>NOW, by St. Paul, the work goes bravely on&mdash;</HI>
I was in bed when I received your packet; and
having read the great letter and the little letter, (the pre|cious
engine of our de&s;igns, I bethought me of a curious
expedient, which I in&s;tantly put in practice. I bounded
out of bed, threw on my night-gown and &s;lippers, and
having nicely picked off the &s;eal from your inclo&s;ed
billet, I as nicely clapped on a fre&s;h one; then giving it
to David, I bid him follow me in a quarter of an hour
to Mr. Falkland's chambers, and give it to me there.
Have not you it already, Sir, &s;aid David, what occa|&s;ion
is there for my bringing it to you again? Do as I
bid you, you dog, and a&s;k no que&s;tions. I then &s;aun|tered
into Falkland's room, whom I found ju&s;t up.
Give me &s;ome coffee, quoth I, and threw my&s;elf into
his ea&s;y chair. Ju&s;t as we began our breakfa&s;t, David
entered, and with a very grave face, and a low bow,
pre&s;ented me your letter; but thinking him&s;elf in a
plot, he could not refrain from tipping me a &s;ly wink,
which it was happy for the repo&s;e of his bones that
Falkland did not ob&s;erve. Having read it, I to&s;&s;ed it
down carele&s;ly on the table. <HI>An Italian &s;crawl,</HI> &s;aid
Falkland, looking at the lines backwards; <HI>which</HI> of
them is it from? (for I have other ladies who write to
me be&s;ides you, Sophy.) If you have any curio&s;ity,
&s;aid I, you may read it; for the mi&s;chief is done al|ready,
and cannot be made wor&s;e by a farther commu|nication.
He took the letter up, and I could ob&s;erve
<PB N="65" REF="67">
by the rogue's face as he read, that his vanity was not
a little flattered. He ro&s;e from his chair without &s;peak|ing,
and walked up as it were mechanically to the gla&s;s,
where having taken a &s;urvey of his own dear irre&s;i&s;tible
figure; You can't imagine, &s;aid he, turning round with
a very &s;olemn face, how much I am affected with this
account which your &s;i&s;ter gives of poor mi&s;s Arnold, I
wi&s;h indeed, as mi&s;s Audley &s;ays, that we had never
known each other. It would have been happy for <HI>her,</HI>
&s;aid I, to&s;&s;ing off my di&s;h of coffee; but I hope her
mother will &s;end for her into Lanca&s;hire, and by way
of curing her melancholy, clap up &s;ome ha&s;ty match
for her, as old lady Bidulph did for Mrs. Arnold. How
I &s;hould laugh at you, Falkland, if we were to &s;ee her
return a bride? Poh, cried he, how can you je&s;t upon
&s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion? I would not for the world that
any con&s;traint &s;hould be laid on poor mi&s;s Arnold's in|clinations;
but I am &s;ure her mama is too fond of her,
and has be&s;ides too much humanity to be capable of
exerci&s;ing any tyranny towards her children. I would
not tru&s;t to that, &s;aid I, if her mama were to know
how <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> her daughter has be&s;towed her heart;
and if my mother &s;hould pick the &s;ecret out of Sophy,
(who by the bye has not the gift of retention) &s;he would
think her&s;elf bound in duty to tell it. Then the old
gray noddles at Burnly (lady V&mdash;'s and Mrs. Darnley's
I mean) would be laid together to prevent the <HI>mi&s;chief,</HI>
as they would call it, and they would be for giving their
mu&s;ty advice to Mrs. Arnold, who, good woman as
&s;he is, would, I believe, as you ob&s;erve, were &s;he left
to her&s;elf, be far from acting tyrannically. Then we
&s;hould have Sir George Bidulph, with his overbearing
in&s;olence, blu&s;tering all the poor women into a &s;tate of
petrefaction; and lady Sarah, &s;crewing up her mouth,
would be <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed</HI> how a young per&s;on <HI>allied</HI> as her
$$$ece is, could forget her&s;elf &s;o far as to conde&s;cend
&mdash;Hold, Sir Edward, cried. Falkland, &s;top
where you are. Fortune has indeed ca&s;t me beneath
mi&s;s Arnold, in depriving me of the inheritance of my
ance&s;tors, el&s;e where's the mighty difference? I believe
the name of Falkland is at lea&s;t as re&s;pectable as that
<PB N="65" REF="68">
of Arnold, and perhaps Bidulph into the bargain.
Doubtle&s;s, &s;aid I; I was not &s;peaking my own &s;enti|ments,
but tho&s;e of lady Sarah, who you know is one
of the proude&s;t women in England. Cur&s;e her pride!
cried he. With all my heart, &s;aid I, (glad to hear the
lad utter &s;o &s;en&s;ible a &s;entence.) I de&s;pi&s;e it, continued
he, as much as I do the arrogance of her hu&s;band, who
always affected, even in my childhood, to treat me as
a wretch whom his &s;i&s;ter's charity pre&s;erved from pe|ri&s;hing;
but there may come a day of retaliation. I wi&s;h,
&s;aid I, for I hate Sir George mo&s;t cordially, that both
the girls would run away with two &s;uch idle fellows
as you and I; I think that would mortify him com|pletely,
for I know he will be for clapping a coro|net
on each of them, merely for the plea&s;ure of &s;aying,
My niece lady &s;uch-a-thing, though the title were lady
Beelzebub.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Falkland was full of indignation; he walked
backwards and forwards two or three times, then taking
up your letter again, which &s;till lay on the table, and
running it over a &s;cond time, And &s;o, &s;aid he, <HI>mi&s;s</HI> Ce|cilia
is the life of the family at Burnly. I wi&s;h &s;he would
&s;pare a little of her vivacity to her poor &s;i&s;ter. The
<HI>mi&s;s</HI> was emphatical, and I perceived he was nettled at
the judicious hint which you threw in with regard to
Cecilia's happy indifference</P>
<P>But what is the meaning, Sir Edward, &s;aid he, that
you don't go and &s;ee mi&s;s Audley? I think &s;he really
has rea&s;on to complain of you. Why truly, Falk|land,
an&s;wered I, I don't think a <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> an inducement
quite &s;trong enough to turn a man from more agree|able
engagements. If I had the &s;ame motives for vi|&s;iting
there that you have, probably &s;he would have le&s;s
cau&s;e to complain. Ay, but compa&s;&s;ion, Sir Edward;
&s;uppo&s;e we were to go to Woodberry this afternoon,
ju&s;t to a&s;k the ladies how they do? With all my heart,
&s;aid I, yawning and &s;tretching my&s;elf out at full length
in the arm-chair.&mdash;What time &s;hall we go? &s;aid he.
Oh, when you will; about five o'clock, I &s;up|po&s;e.&mdash;Falkland,
will you lend me this book? point|ing
<PB N="67" REF="69">
to a collection of poems that &s;tood on the chim|ney-piece.</P>
<P>I left him here; and now, Sophy, you may expect
to &s;ee Falkland at the above-mentioned hour; but not
your humble &s;ervant you may depend on it. Your
me&s;&s;enger has ju&s;t this minute called on me, &s;o I hurry
him off with a heap of trumpery pamphlets for a
blind; but remember I expect a good account of this
&s;ame vi&s;it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mi&s;s AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>July 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EDWARD, I am not amorous enough to enter
into the &s;pirit of a love &s;cene, and had any eclair|ci&s;&s;ement
been brought about, I &s;hould have laid down
my pen in de&s;pair, for I would not attempt to de&s;cribe
the &s;ublime folly of a pair of happy lovers met toge|ther.
I &s;hall however, I think, be able to paint the
moderately &s;illy &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed here this evening.
Tru&s;t not to Falkland's repre&s;entation, but take it
from my faithful hand.</P>
<P>He arrived here a little before &s;ix. Mi&s;s Arnold and
I were &s;itting at work in her dre&s;&s;ing-room. Mr. Price,
according to cu&s;tom, gone to take his evening's nap.
We heard Orlando coming up &s;tairs, talking to, and ca|re&s;&s;ing
Mi&s;s Arnold's little lap-dog, who ran to meet
him. There's Mr. Falkland, &s;aid I; Dolly turned
pale, and in&s;tantly took out her &s;melling-bottle, which
I believe prevented her from fainting. The footman
threw open the door, and in darted the triumphant
varlet blooming as a cherub; the wind as he rid had
heightened his colour and blown his auburn hair a|bout
his cheeks; he really looked in&s;ufferably hand|&s;ome.
Poor Dolly made him a very low curt&s;ie, unable
to &s;peak. He addre&s;&s;ed me fir&s;t, then advancing to
<PB N="68" REF="70">
her with &s;omething in his air that I never ob&s;erved be|fore,
I hope, ma'am, you are perfectly recovered from
your indi&s;po&s;ition &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t? <HI>Madam</HI> was a
new expre&s;&s;ion. She an&s;wered in the &s;ame &s;train, I am
much better, Sir, only to-day I have had a little return
of the head-ach. Falkland looked earne&s;tly at her; her
con&s;cious eyes, unable to meet his, were ca&s;t down to
the ground. He took the work &s;he was doing out of
her hand; (it was a pur&s;e which &s;he intended for him)
Extremely pretty, he &s;aid it was, &s;o well fancied! but
would not working make her head wor&s;e? and he held
it behind his back. It is for you, &s;aid I, that &s;he is &s;o
bu&s;ily employed. For me, my dear creature! then I
in&s;i&s;t on your laying it by, at lea&s;t that you do no more
of it whil&s;t I am here. Mi&s;s Arnold blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ive|ly;
but &s;uffered him to put her work into a little ba&s;ket
that lay on the window. He did this with that &s;ort of
authority which a man a&s;&s;umes even in trifles where he
knows he has power. Dolly looked exceedingly &s;illy,
having nothing now to take off her attention from Falk|land.
He &s;aid he &s;hould be obliged to her for a di&s;h
of tea, and &s;he flew to ring the bell with an alacrity
which &s;hewed her readine&s;s to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, his
&s;malle&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I enquired after you: He is a &s;ad lazy fellow, &s;aid
Falkland; I propo&s;ed to him that we &s;hould both wait
on you together this evening, and he promi&s;ed to come
with me; but when the appointed hour arrived, no Sir
Edward was to be found. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome vagary
came acro&s;s him, which made him forget his en|gagement.</P>
<P>The tea was brought up, which a little relieved Mi&s;s
Arnold from the awkwardne&s;s of her &s;ituation, as it
afforded her &s;omething to do; but how different was
this from our former little parties! Nothing entertain|ing,
nothing in&s;tructive, nothing even lively was &s;aid
of either &s;ide; in &s;hort, neither of them &s;poke a word
of common &s;en&s;e, a vi&s;ible con&s;traint chained both
their tongues; and Falkland who has as much vivacity,
and Dolly who has as good an under&s;tanding as any
one, appeared each under greater di&s;advantages than
<PB N="69" REF="71">
ever I &s;aw them. Yet I could perceive that Falkland
was not inattentive to his deportment; (what de&s;igning
wretches you men are!) the creature contrived to be a|miable
in every attitude into which he threw him&s;elf,
and when their eyes happened to encounter, he had
the impudence to blu&s;h; ay, the <HI>impudence,</HI> for it was
not mode&s;ty; while, on the contrary, the an&s;wering
vermillion that mantled in the cheeks of Mi&s;s Arnold,
was laid on by the innocent hand of ba&s;hfulne&s;s. He
a&s;ked, Were there any hopes of Mrs. Arnold's &s;peedy
return? No, Dolly replied, &s;he can't yet leave poor
lady V&mdash;; my mama is to be pitied in &s;o melancholy a
&s;ituation. Your &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t have but a dull time of it,
&s;aid the fly toad, over-doing the thing from a con&s;cious
knowledge of what I had written to you on that head.
I &s;hould have thought &s;o too, &s;aid Dolly; but my
mama writes me word that Cecilia's con&s;tant chearful|ne&s;s
is the only re&s;ource which &s;upports my mama's
own &s;pirits. This was a mo&s;t fortunate reply. Falk|land
was &s;ilent for a little while, then with an expre&s;|&s;ion
in his looks, which &s;aid in plain Engli&s;h, <HI>I know
you love me, and I am almo&s;t inclined to return it,</HI> he
an&s;wered, Some people are happy through in&s;en&s;ibility;
I wi&s;h I could change hearts with Cecilia. A fort
of a half &s;igh which he blew away, conveyed even
more than he &s;poke. Whether this was drawn from
him at the thoughts of Cecilia's indifference, or
through compa&s;&s;ion to her &s;i&s;ter, I can't pretend to
&s;ay.</P>
<P>Dolly's confu&s;ion was too apparent to be concealed;
&s;he leaned her head on one of her hands, re&s;ting her
fine turned arm on the tea-table, her eyes half clo&s;ed;
and I thought that Falkland gazed at her with a mix|ture
of tenderne&s;s, gratitude, and pity. This &s;eemed
a lucky cri&s;is, and I thought might be productive
of &s;omething, if a third per&s;on were not pre&s;ent. I
ro&s;e from my chair. Where are you going? cried
Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;tarting from her reverie. Only for &s;ome
thread to fini&s;h my work, &s;aid I, (for I had pretended
to be fiddling at it all the time we were at tea.) Pray,
my dear, work no more this evening, &s;aid &s;he, let us
<PB N="70" REF="72">
go and take a turn in the garden. I mu&s;t go for my
hat then, I replied. She looked embarra&s;&s;ed, as if a|fraid
of being left alone with Falkland, and ri&s;ing up, &s;aid
&s;he al&s;o would go for her's, and accordingly followed
me out of the room.</P>
<P>What's your opinion, &s;aid &s;he, taking me by the arm
as we entered my chamber, has your brother been
faithful to you or not? I know not, I replied; but of
thus much I am &s;ure, that Falkland has betrayed the
lover more than once this evening. I thought &s;o too,
an&s;wered &s;he; Oh, Sophy, where, where will this
end? In your mutual happine&s;s I hope, my dear. Oh,
no, which ever way I ca&s;t my eyes, happine&s;s has
turned her back upon me. Sophy, I charge you ne|ver
leave me when Falkland comes to vi&s;it us, for I tell
you once more, I have no &s;ecurity but in his &s;ilence.
I wi&s;h my mama would return, or &s;end for me to
Burnly, 'twere better I were in my grave than that
I &s;hould overturn the hopes and the peace of my whole
family.</P>
<P>When we went back to the room where we had
left Falkland, we found, Mr. Price with him. They
had entered upon &s;ome literary &s;ubject, in which the
pupil &s;eemed to acquit him&s;elf very much to the &s;atis|faction
of his tutor. The old man joined us in our
walk into the garden, &s;o that nothing more to the
purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ed for the re&s;t of the afternoon; only
I could ob&s;erve that Falkland in bidding Mi&s;s Arnold
adieu, looked&mdash;I don't know how; but not as he
u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>Old Price entertained us with his prai&s;es all &s;upper|time,
and Dolly &s;eemed &s;o delighted, I thought two
or three times &s;he would have ki&s;&s;ed the old man.</P>
<P>Edward, if this affair &s;hould turn out unfortunately,
I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf for the part I have
acted in it; for next to your happine&s;s I really wi&s;h
that of poor Mi&s;s Arnold. Yet at wor&s;t, I cannot &s;ee
any great harm that can en&s;ue, but a little <HI>fracas</HI> in the
Arnold family; and if they &s;hould be &s;o ob&s;tinate as
never to take her into grace again, &s;he has a fortune in
<PB N="71" REF="73">
her own power &s;ufficient to make her happy with the
man &s;he loves.</P>
<P>As for Cecilia, if you can win her affections, which
I am partial enough to you to think very probable, I
believe you would not find it difficult to obtain her.
She loves gaiety, and, by the bye, is a little weary of
re&s;traint; and one thing I am &s;ure of, as &s;he has more
&s;pirit than her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he will not have a choice impo&s;ed
on her by her friends, of which &s;he her&s;elf does not
approve. I remember once when we girls were talking
over Mrs Arnold's unfortunate &s;tory, Cecilia blamed
her grand-mama Bidulph's &s;cruples with regard to Mr.
Falkland, the father of your friend, and went &s;o far
as to &s;ay that &s;he thought her mother had made too
great a &s;acrifice to duty, in giving him up &s;o ea&s;ily.
This makes for you, Edward; &s;he is not &s;o much ter|rified
at the thoughts of a giddy fellow as her &s;i&s;ter is;
be&s;ides, really I think your family and rank in life might
very fairly entitle you to either of them, &s;o that (ab|&s;tractedly
from the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity you are under of
getting twenty thou&s;and pounds <HI>&s;ome</HI> where, and which
is not to be found under every &s;tone) I am far from
looking upon an alliance as an injury to the family,
not even to Sir George Bidulph's &s;aucy looks, and lady
Sarah's pinched no&s;e.</P>
<P>I have left Dolly reading politicks to the old dryad,
who&s;e eyes begin to fail him, and have &s;tole up &s;tairs
to &s;cribble. I &s;hall di&s;patch this to you early in the
morning by my flying-po&s;t, as I call Jerry, and
you may return me a line by him to inform me how
Falkland's pul&s;e beats, if you have &s;een him &s;ince his
vi&s;it here.</P>
<Q>P. S. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you that Dolly
and I had half an hour's chat by our&s;elves after
Falkland was; gone, for I am now no longer for|bid
to &s;peak of him; the ca&s;e is altered, our fears
of his indifference are at an end. The poor girl
finds her&s;elf plunged in deeper than before, and
wonders at the cau&s;e; for <HI>&s;he is affected beyond
mea&s;ure at the thoughts of his being as wretched as
<PB N="72" REF="74">
her&s;elf.</HI> Hang me if I believe her; the plea&s;ure
of being beloved again, more than counterba|lances
her &s;ears for the con&s;equences, and I be|lieve
at this minute &s;he does not well know
whether &s;he is &s;orry or glad.</Q>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>July 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A Few words, Sophy, and no more. Falkland
&s;upped with with me la&s;t night, and after hav|ing
railed at me for breaking my engagement, which
I excu&s;ed my own way, he told me what pa&s;&s;ed in
ye&s;terday's interview pretty nearly as you related it;
only with a few additions &s;ugge&s;ted, I &s;uppo&s;e, by
his own vanity; for he &s;aid Mi&s;s Arnold look'd &s;o
pale and langui&s;hing that it grieved him to the
heart, and he could <HI>kill</HI> him&s;elf for being the cau&s;e.
Coxcomb, muttered I to my&s;elf, what pity it is thou
can&s;t boa&s;t of &s;uch a conque&s;t! The thing was now
&s;o apparent, he &s;aid, that a man mu&s;t be blind not to
&s;ee it; and the lady mu&s;t think him very &s;tupid, or
very ungrateful, if he did not at lea&s;t appear &s;en&s;ible
of the honour &s;he did him. Very true, Falkland,
undoubtedly, the laws of humanity, the laws of ci|vility
demand &s;o much from you. For though it is
the farthe&s;t in the world from my thoughts, &s;aid he,
to take any advantage of her tenderne&s;s, yet &s;urely I
may make her a return of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem,
though I mean to go no farther. By all means, &s;aid
I; or &s;uppo&s;e you were to throw in a little <HI>Platonic</HI>
love, there can be no harm in that either; two &s;e|raphims
might entertain <HI>that</HI> for each other; and
Mi&s;s Arnold &s;eems of a turn to reli&s;h tho&s;e aetherial
ardors, much better than a vulgar pa&s;&s;ion. I &s;aid
this with &s;o grave a countenance and tone of voice,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
that he did not find me out. I am much of your
mind, replied he; and if I thought it would contri|bute
to her happine&s;s, I would pay her my Platonic
adorations with all my &s;oul, for I have ab&s;olutely no
de&s;igns upon her per&s;on, though I think her very
hand&s;ome, but Cecilia has been beforehand with her
in my heart. Well, prithee, &s;aid I, take compa&s;&s;ion
on the poor girl; you may make love to her in
blank ver&s;e; (for a man is never &s;erious but in pro&s;e)
and if &s;he allows you the privilege of ki&s;&s;ing the
tip of her little finger, (though I believe even that
is beyond the bounds of Platoni&s;m) you mu&s;t &s;eem in
raptures with the favour, and &s;peak of it as the ulti|mate
of your wi&s;hes. This will &s;oothe her and divert
you, and no harm can come of it; and &s;o here's
Dolly Arnold's health. We both drank it, and he
&s;eems plea&s;ed with the conceit. Yet 'tis &s;uch a &s;ly
varlet, that even my plummet, which is not a &s;hort
one, cannot fathom him to the bottom; for whether
he really means to pur&s;ue this hint, or pretended to
adopt it merely to &s;ave his credit with me, after his
former declarations. I am at a lo&s;s to determine;
but be it which way it will, the &s;ucce&s;s is equally
&s;ure, for I never knew a pair of &s;eraphic lovers who
did not bring matters to a very earthly conclu&s;ion
in the end, no matter what their de&s;igns were at &s;et|ting
out. I think it only now remains to contrive
opportunities for Falkland to expre&s;s his <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted
friend&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>exalted e&s;teem</HI> for Mi&s;s Arnold, with|out
any witne&s;&s;es. I wi&s;h the venerable Price would
take a nap for the remainder of the &s;ummer, for he $word$
very much in our way; yet he &s;ometimes dines
abroad; can't you give me notice of tho&s;e days, and
I'll engage for Falkland's attending you on them?
depend upon it he will not want much &s;purring; I
&s;hall turn his vanity to good account. And then you
know, Sophy, you mu&s;t &s;ometimes pay your duty to
your mama, why not <HI>that</HI> day as well as another?
You had ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed before, and your mama
will take it ill if you di&s;appoint her. As for my part,
I have &s;o many whim&s;ical engagements, that I can
<PB N="74" REF="76">
never be at a lo&s;s to excu&s;e my&s;elf for not going
with Falkland, if he &s;hould a&s;k me; I don't know
whether I &s;han't even tell him, that having had my|&s;elf
a little <HI>penchant</HI> for Mi&s;s Arnold, it would not af|ford
me the lea&s;t entertainment to be an humble &s;pecta|tor
of his triumphs. There will be nothing ami&s;s in
this, I think; yet I &s;hall either venture it or not, as
occa&s;ion &s;erves.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here follows a &s;eries of letters between Mi&s;s Aud|ley
and her brother, by which it appears that Mr.
Falkland daily gained a &s;tronger a&s;cendency over the
heart of Mi&s;s Arnold; and if he did not altogether
adopt the Platonic &s;y&s;tem, he at lea&s;t had not made
any declarations of another nature. The lady gives
her brother a circum&s;tantial account of what pa&s;&s;ed
in every vi&s;it; &s;ome of which were contrived (tho'
without Mi&s;s Arnold's knowledge) in Mr. Price's ab|&s;ence;
Mi&s;s Audley her&s;elf &s;ometimes forming pre|tences
to be out of the way, on which occa&s;ion her
friend always told her the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e conver|&s;ations
&s;he held with Falkland.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Audley, on the other hand, relates to
his &s;i&s;ter what di&s;coveries he had made in the <HI>inve&s;ti|gation,</HI>
as he calls it, of Falkland's heart, and where|in
he hints that he &s;till thought him devoted to Ce|cilia.
During the cour&s;e of this whole corre&s;pon|dence,
there is manife&s;ted a &s;urprizing deal of art,
practi&s;ed by this intriguing brother and &s;i&s;ter, in or|der
to pervert the minds of the two young per&s;ons,
on whom they had their &s;eparate influence; in which
attempt, Sir Edward &s;eems to have in &s;ome mea&s;ure
&s;ucceeded. It appears that Mi&s;s Audley and her bro|ther
but &s;eldom met, which in one of her letters &s;he
accounts for in the&s;e words, &startq;It will not be now in
my power to &s;ee you, for as my mama is going to
the Farm with Harry, (who I think continues very
puny) I &s;hall have no pretence for going to Ox|ford,
as Mi&s;s Arnold knows I have no acquaintance
among&s;t the towns-people, and &s;he is with me in
every other vi&s;it I make.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
As the above-mentioned &s;eries of letters contain a
very minute detail, which though not unentertaining,
does neverthele&s;s not very con&s;iderably advance the
&s;tory; the editor has, to avoid &s;welling this collec|tion
to too great a bulk, omitted them; and in this
place pre&s;ents the reader with one from Mrs. Ar|nold,
which he has &s;elected from &s;ome others as that

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mi&s;s ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Burnly, <DATE>Sept. 3d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought to have embraced my deare&s;t Dolly as
on this day, and am as much mortified at the di&s;|appointment,
as I am &s;ure &s;he will be; but an un|looked
for accident has occurred, which will detain
me here a week or ten days longer.</P>
<P>You know, I told you in my la&s;t, that lady V&mdash;
had been ordered to the Bath by her phy&s;icians.
Poor woman, &s;he has not only lo&s;t all appetite, but
now complains of &s;uch a con&s;tant and violent pain in
her &s;tomach, that if the waters don't relieve her,
we are apprehen&s;ive of the wor&s;t con&s;equences. The
very day on which this journey was determined,
and fixed for the fir&s;t of September, I received a
letter from lady Sarah, in which &s;he informed me
that &s;he was going immediately to Bath to &s;pend a
couple of months there; that Sir George was to
call on her in his way to London, and that they
&s;hould come to town together, &s;he <HI>hoped</HI> before Chri&s;t|mas.
She complains of not being well; but the truth,
I believe is, &s;he was tired of Sidney Ca&s;tle, for, you
know, &s;he hates the country. A thought unluckily
came into lady V&mdash;'s head, which has been pro|ductive
of &s;omething that has vexed me extremely.
She begged I would write to lady Sarah, and intreat
<PB N="76" REF="78">
the favour of her to hire a hou&s;e for lady V&mdash;and
her family. As Mrs. and Mi&s;s Darnley go with her,
they do not chu&s;e to be in lodgings, and they wi&s;hed
to have a place ready for their reception again&s;t they
went down.</P>
<P>I writ immediately to lady Sarah agreeably to this
reque&s;t, and was favoured directly with an an&s;wer,
wherein &s;he tells me &s;he has engaged a hou&s;e for lady
V&mdash;, be&s;eeching me at the &s;ame time to let Mi&s;s Ce|cilia
come with her to Bath, as &s;he (lady Sarah) was
quite alone, and I &s;hould make her wonderfully happy
by indulging her with her niece's company. Incon&s;i|derate
woman! &s;he values not the repo&s;e of any one
but her&s;elf. Is &s;he not to have you both with her next
winter? and next winter may perhaps open to you
new pro&s;pects, &s;uch as probably may &s;eparate you
from your mother's arms; why then am I to be de|prived
of my Cecilia's chearful &s;ociety &s;ooner than
there is a nece&s;&s;ity for it? Why are you to be robbed
of your &s;i&s;ter's company after an ab&s;ence already too
long? For &s;he adds in her letter, &startq;I &s;hall bring Cecilia
to London with me directly from hence, and Sir
George him&s;elf &s;hall go down to Oxford&s;hire for
Mi&s;s Arnold on our return to town.&endq;</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my dear, how this un&s;ea&s;ona|ble
demand has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, becau&s;e I cannot well
tell how to refu&s;e it. You are no &s;tranger to the cap|tious
temper of lady Sarah, nor to the influence &s;he
has over your uncle. I know I &s;hould utterly di&s;oblige
both by a denial, and perhaps deprive you of the ad|vantage
of being with Sir George next winter, as my
brother's actions are altogether regulated by her lady|&s;hip's
plea&s;ure. Lady V&mdash;, who looks upon this as an
agreeable jaunt for any daughter, is very pre&s;&s;ing that
I &s;hould let her go; &s;o are the other two ladies, but
the child her&s;elf wi&s;hes to return to her &s;i&s;ter. I can|not,
however, excu&s;e my&s;elf; Lady Sarah's in&s;tances
are &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, the opportunity &s;o convenient, and the
company with whom &s;he is to go, &s;o eligible, that I
have had an unwilling con&s;ent wiung from me already.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">
The hou&s;e which lady Sarah has taken cannot be
ready, it &s;eems, this week, which has po&s;tponed lady
V&mdash;s' journey, and in con&s;equence of that my return
home; as I would fain enjoy as much of my daugh|ter's
company as I can. She embraces you, my love,
with all her heart. Tell my Orlando I am delighted
with the account Mr. Price gives me of the progre&s;s
he is making in his &s;tudies; he &s;hares my heart equally
with you and your &s;i&s;ter. I hope the good old man
approves as much of you in your capacity of mi&s;tre&s;s
of a family, as he does in every thing el&s;e; and that
you have &s;upplied my place on more important oc|ca&s;ions
than merely that of pre&s;iding at my table.
A&s;&s;ure Mi&s;s Audley I am highly &s;en&s;ible of the obli|gation
I have to her and good lady Audley, for thus
prolonging the happine&s;s you have received from your

<P>I'LL tell you what's to be done, Sophy; I &s;et out
to-morrow morning po&s;t for Bath, where, getting
the &s;tart of the Burnly &s;nails, I &s;hall be on the &s;pot to
receive my little divinity, and &s;hall take care to anti|cipate

moralize with lady V&mdash;, lecture on hou&s;ewi&s;ery with
Mrs. Darnley, and be&s;patter reputations with the mid|dle-aged
maiden the daughter. Why, lord, child, 'tis
the luckie&s;t thing that could have happened; I look
to be the idol of the whole &s;et, and think it not at
<PB N="79" REF="81">
all unlikely that I &s;hould trundle off Cecilia in a
Coach and &s;ix before the end of November.&mdash;Ay,
&s;ay you; but what pretence have you for taking this
journey? what will Falkland &s;ay to &s;uch a flight?
Ble&s;s me, Sophy! have not you heard that our uncle
Howel in Wales, who has been dying for the&s;e ten
years, is now going to die in good earne&s;t? and that,
forgetting all old animo&s;ities, he is going to make his
la&s;t will, and has &s;ent for me, his heir apparent, to
&s;ee me before his departure, and commit to my hands
the pious care of clo&s;ing his eyes? You have not
heard a &s;yllable of the matter? Hearkye, Sophy, a
word in your ear; nor I neither. I would I could.
Yet the thing mu&s;t be ju&s;t &s;o; and I &s;hall have in
ten minutes, the letter from his &s;teward, commanding
my per&s;onal attendance, ready written in my pocket.
The &s;hort cut is from Glouce&s;ter&s;hire acro&s;s the Se|vern;
and then, what &s;o natural (the old gentleman
having grown &s;omewhat better, his mind being re|lieved
by this his prudent di&s;po&s;ition of his worldly
affairs) what is &s;o natural, I &s;ay, as for me, poor
young man, wearied with my con&s;tant attendance on a
&s;ick bed, in my return to take a little trip to Bath,
by way of relaxation? for the &s;tory &s;hall pa&s;s current
there too&mdash;Ay; but then Cecilia will write home
word that you are not only at Bath, but that you
make love to <HI>her:</HI> She tells this to Dolly, Dolly tells
it to Falkland, and then&mdash;Prithee &s;top, Sophy,
don't be &s;o rapid in thy conclu&s;ions; for not a tittle
of this will come to pa&s;s. Cecilia is good humour
it&s;elf, and I need only &s;ay, My dear ma'am, pre&s;&s;ing
her hand gently (at a ball perhaps) when you write
into Oxford&s;hire, if <HI>I</HI> am ever honoured with having
a &s;ingle thought be&s;towed on me, be &s;o good as not to
mention my being here; becau&s;e I know if it &s;hould
by any means come to my mother's ears, &s;he would
be much di&s;plea&s;ed at it, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es I am &s;till
with my uncle, though I have ab&s;olutely his permi&s;|&s;ion
for returning home: but you know, ma'am, that
ladies of a <HI>certain</HI> age do not always make proper al|lowances
for young people. I am mi&s;taken in my
<PB N="80" REF="82">
girl if &s;he tells after this. The letter from Burnly,
you &s;ay, was received this day, ju&s;t after Falkland
had taken his leave. He will not then know the con|tents
of it till his next vi&s;it, which probably will not
be the&s;e three or four days; and the deuce is in it
if he can &s;u&s;pect, again&s;t all likelihood, that I was
before-hand with him: &s;o that I mean to-night (for
I have not yet &s;een him to-day) to &s;hew him the let|ter
that I received from my uncle's &s;teward (he him|&s;elf,
poor &s;oul, is not able to write) and I leave it to
my mother to apprize you of this my &s;udden journey,
as I have not a minute's time to write you a &s;ingle

&s;kims before the wind.</P>
<P>Thus far in rhodomontade, by way of an&s;wering
your querulous demand of, <HI>What's to be done, Edward?</HI>
But now to be &s;erious; you and I con&s;ider this cir|cum&s;tance
of Cecilia's vi&s;it to Bath in very different
lights. Had Falkland had either love enough, or
courage enough, (for I know not in which of the
two he is mo&s;t wanting) to have brought matters to a
conclu&s;ion with Mi&s;s Arnold, Cecilia's return to
Woodberry would then have been a de&s;irable thing, as
I might, in that ca&s;e, agreeably to your ideas, have
&s;afely ventured to offer up my incen&s;e to her in &s;ome
<HI>&s;eque&s;tered bower,</HI> without fear of having my devotions
interrupted by any competitor for her favour. But
un&s;teady as Falkland is in all his purpo&s;es, and parti|cularly
&s;o with regard to Mi&s;s Arnold, I think, his
having her &s;i&s;ter before his eyes (to whom I know him
attached) was a thing rather to be dreaded; and tho'
he has no hopes of her him&s;elf, he would certainly
be a bar to my preten&s;ions. On the contrary, cut off
as he now is from the expectation of &s;eeing her (as &s;he
is to go from Bath directly to London) I think he will,
in all human probability, be wi&s;e enough not to lo&s;e a
&s;ub&s;tance for a &s;hadow, but, laying hold of Mi&s;s Ar|nold's
favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him, he will, in
&s;ome &s;oft minute, determine, and declare him&s;elf.
Once fixed, he is no longer to be feared; and I may,
without reproach, pur&s;ue my fortune. I &s;hall &s;pend
<PB N="81" REF="83">
all the coming winter in London, an advantage which
will be out of <HI>his</HI> power; and as I intend &s;tudiou&s;ly to
cultivate lady Sarah's acquaintance, I &s;hall at lea&s;t be
always &s;ure of a reception in town, whil&s;t poor Falk|land
perhaps will be glad to u&s;e my intervention with
his love; for I do not &s;uppo&s;e the little da&s;tard will
venture at once to run away with him. This, you
&s;ee, will make me a per&s;on of importance with Dolly;
con&s;equently get her on my &s;ide, and engage her to
promote my intere&s;ts with her &s;i&s;ter: &s;o that, though
things have taken a turn in &s;ome re&s;pects different
from what we expected, our main purpo&s;e remains
unchanged; and I hold it expedient that Falkland's
amour &s;hould be advanced with your be&s;t &s;kill. Fail
not to let me know how the quick&s;ilver ri&s;es and falls
in that variable machine&mdash;</P>

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>Sept. 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY thing hitherto has happened preci&s;ely as
I fore&s;aw it would&mdash;And where do you think I
am lodged? Even under the very roof with my Cecilia;
for I took care, the moment I got hither, to &s;ecure
lodgings in the &s;ame hou&s;e with lady Sarah Bidulph,
who perfectly <HI>doats</HI> on me. What do you think of
that, Sophy? I would not change my knack of di&s;|&s;embling
for an e&s;tate of five thou&s;and a year: and I
am wife in the preference; for I &s;hould &s;quander the
one in a year or two, and the other is an inexhau&s;ti|ble
trea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
Lady Sarah (to whom I early paid my court) told
me by way of news (for I was but ju&s;t arrived from
Wales) that &s;he expected her niece in a day or two&punc;
'Tis very kind in your lady&s;hip, &s;aid I, to take the
poor young creature under your own conduct; for to
&s;ay the truth, Mrs. Arnold (though &s;he is an extreme
<HI>good</HI> woman) is not <HI>quite</HI> the pattern that one would
choo&s;e for young per&s;ons to form their manners by,
who may probably one day make a figure in the po|lite
world&mdash;Why that's the very thing, Sir Ed|ward;
the poor creatures are ab&s;olutely ru&s;ticated&mdash;
Oh, ma'am, they will be totally undone, if you don't
take them into your own hands; for all the world
knows your lady&s;hip's knowledge in the &s;cience of good
<HI>breeding</HI> is &s;uperior to that of almo&s;t every woman of
quality in England&mdash;Oh, Sir, your humble &s;er|vant
&mdash;I believe, indeed, (with as plea&s;ed a look
as the little crabbed countenance could a&s;&s;ume) I have
been rather more conver&s;ant in tho&s;e matters than
poor Mrs. Arnold. How do you pa&s;s your time, lady
Sarah? are there any people of fa&s;hion here at pre|&s;ent?
Lord, I don't know; I am but ju&s;t come my|&s;elf;
though I fancy there are but few here as yet
that one can conver&s;e with. If your lady&s;hip has any
&s;ervices to command me, I am intirely at your de|votion.</P>
<P>We walked out together. She fell in love with a
&s;et of china that &s;tood in a &s;hop window as we pa&s;&s;ed
by; but upon enquiry, finding them, as &s;he thought,
too dear, her avarice got the better of her pa&s;&s;ion,
and &s;he went home without buying them; but I took
care to &s;end them to her, and was invited to drink
tea out of them the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>When the family of Burnly arrived, having already
dedicated my&s;elf to lady Sarah, I was determined not
to lo&s;e ground by the approach of Cecilia. On the
contrary, I have made my&s;elf ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
them all. I go to church with lady V&mdash;, and to
market with Mrs. Darnley; for &s;he is too notable to
tru&s;t this office to a &s;ervant. I <HI>&s;hop</HI> it, as the ladies
call it, with lady Sarah, and be&s;peak caps at the
<PB N="83" REF="85">
milliners for the girls. In &s;hort, they all allow me
to be a <HI>very mode&s;t pretty kind of young man;</HI> and if
my <HI>e&s;tate</HI> were an&s;werable, lady Sarah &s;hould not
<HI>much</HI> di&s;like me for one of her nieces. This &s;he whi&s;|pered
to Mi&s;s Darnley, who dropped it to her waiting|maid,
who told it to David, who communicates
every thing to his ma&s;ter. But all the&s;e &s;erve but as
a chorus to a dramatic piece: they may help to carry
on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;cene, but are none of them in
them&s;elves objects of attention. The principal per|&s;onage,
the heroine of the &s;tory, the Cecilia, I have
not yet been able &s;ufficiently to draw out from
among&s;t this group of &s;upernumerary figures. 'Tis
&s;uch a little fla&s;h of lightening, there is no knowing
where to have her; and if I were to be hanged for it,
I cannot at this minute divine whether &s;he likes me
or not; but I rather &s;u&s;pect &s;he does. I have been
playing my batteries on her for &s;everal days, and am
always received with good humour. I make love to
her &s;ometimes, even before lady Sarah's face, who,
looking upon it (for that very rea&s;on) as plea&s;antry,
does not di&s;courage it; but if I grow &s;erious, as I now
and then do, when I get Cecilia in a corner, the ur|chin
always calls Mi&s;s Darnley to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
then the two wa&s;ps fa&s;ten on me, and &s;ting me to
death with their flippant tongues. This is, Sophy,
but the opening of the campaign; yet I hope to re|turn
to you crowned with laurels; and then I think,
with the help of Falkland's myrtles, we may twine a
pretty garland.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mi&s;s AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Sept. 25th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT an idle creature are you, brother, not to
have given me a line &s;ooner! when you might
be very certain, that irregular as I know you to be in
your motions, I would not venture to write to you till
<PB N="84" REF="86">
I was &s;ure you were fixed. I believe I mu&s;t allow,
after all, that though we women have livelier imagina|tions,
you men have deeper judgments, and know
better how to deduce con&s;equences; for our affairs
here are beginning to &s;all into the very track which
you fore&s;aw and foretold. Falkland &s;eems nettled at
Cecilia's going to Bath, in&s;tead of returning home with
her mama, as if he thought him&s;elf neglected by it;
and by way of being revenged on her for &s;lighting a
pa&s;&s;ion of which &s;he is ignorant, and which probably
were &s;he to know &s;he would contemn, he is become
more a&s;&s;iduous than ever with regard to Dolly. How
ridiculous is this! yet 'tis human nature, at lea&s;t 'tis
the nature of you &s;triplings. It is matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment
to me, that he has not yet a&s;&s;umed courage
enough to declare him&s;elf; for that he has not done &s;o
I am convinced, and Mi&s;s Arnold begins to lull her
fears a&s;leep with a pretty idea which &s;he has lately
taken up, viz. that there is a <HI>mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip</HI>
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, which, if it were not for
con&s;iderations of duty, <HI>might,</HI> &s;he owns, po&s;&s;ibly ri&s;e
to a real pa&s;&s;ion on <HI>both</HI> &s;ides; but checked as they
now are, they content them&s;elves with confining their
ardor within the bounds of <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> and de&s;ire no greater
felicity than &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with each other. I
indulge her in this romantic folly, relying on your &s;a|gacity
for what the conclu&s;ion of this fancy will be,
when opportunity &s;erves.</P>
<P>I returned home, overwhelmed with thanks and ac|knowledgments,
the day after Mrs. Arnold arrived at
her own hou&s;e; and &s;ince that, Falkland's vi&s;its to
Woodberry have not been &s;o frequent, for the good
lady does not approve of &s;uch repeated excur&s;ions from
<HI>our</HI> &s;tudies; but you may be &s;ure I do not &s;uffer a
harmle&s;s and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip to langui&s;h for
want of the means to keep it up: therefore whenever
Dolly pays me a vi&s;it without her mama, which is
often the ca&s;e, Falkland is always of the party; for
what is more natural than to a&s;k him, who is next door
to us in a manner, to come and drink tea with his <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI>
Arnold? But the wor&s;t of it is, I cannot, upon tho&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="87">
occa&s;ions, contrive, with any colour of decorum, to
leave them to a <HI>tete a tete;</HI> and I don't take it to be
the mode now-a-days, as it was in times of old, for
lovers to breathe out their amorous wi&s;hes in the pre|&s;ence
of a confidante. I have, however, given a little
&s;troke, on which I pique my&s;elf, and from which I
expect wonderful good effects.</P>
<P>I was ye&s;terday to pay Mi&s;s Arnold a morning vi&s;it.
Whil&s;t I was with her, a letter arrived from Bath: it
was from Cecilia. Dolly opened it with impatience,
and I ob&s;erved &s;miled as &s;he read. What entertains you
&s;o much? &s;aid I. Cecilia is in high &s;pirits, &s;aid &s;he,
and extremely plea&s;ant in her little narratives. And
why won't you let me partake of the plea&s;ure? She
read part of the fir&s;t page of the letter to me, in which
Cecilia, in her &s;prightly way, gives an account of the
company, amu&s;ements, &amp;c. when coming towards the
bottom, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort, &s;kipped over &s;ome lines,
and began a paragraph at the other &s;ide. What's that
you boggle &s;o at, Dolly? There is a &s;ecret here, &s;aid
&s;he, which I mu&s;t not divulge&mdash;Tell it me this minute?
you do nothing if you don't give me the &s;ecret.
Would <HI>I</HI> keep one from you? Ah, &s;y, Mi&s;s Arnold!&mdash;
She &s;miled again, and giving me the letter, There,
&s;aid &s;he, there &s;eems to be very little in it, nor can I
conceive why my &s;i&s;ter &s;hould enjoin me &s;ecrecy;
but &s;ince &s;he <HI>has</HI> done &s;o, I de&s;ire, Sophy, you won't
&s;peak of it to any one. My mama is &s;o indulgent, &s;he
never de&s;ires to &s;ee the corre&s;pondence which pa&s;&s;es
between my &s;i&s;ter and me. Cecilia, after having, by
way of raillery, talked of &s;ome conque&s;ts &s;he had
made, &s;ays the&s;e words: &startq;All the&s;e are but flutterers,
and I believe only <HI>pretend</HI> to like me, becau&s;e I am
the fa&s;hion; but I <HI>have</HI> a lover here, who is one in
&s;ober &s;adne&s;s: for when a man tries to win the good
opinion of one's friends, we may be &s;ure he means
&s;omething more than m$re compliment. You would
be &s;urprized were I to name him, but that I &s;han't
do till we meet. Mean while I have particular rea|&s;ons
that even thus much &s;hould not be known:
<PB N="86" REF="88">
therefore I beg, my dear, you will not mention it to
any one what&s;oever.&endq;</P>
<P>I returned the letter to Dolly, telling her, I thought
her &s;i&s;ter had intru&s;ted ju&s;t <HI>nothing</HI> to her confidence.
I concluded, Cecilia meant no other than <HI>you</HI> by this
namele&s;s lover, and thought her very faithful in keep|ing
your coun&s;el; but I re&s;olved at the &s;ame time to
make a proper u&s;e of the hint &s;he had given her &s;i&s;ter.
I engaged Dolly, with her mama's permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;pend
the next day with me. She came accordingly this
morning; Falkland was with us; we three were in
the garden together. He a&s;ked Mi&s;s Arnold when &s;he
had heard from her &s;i&s;ter? Ye&s;terday, &s;he replied. He
hoped Mi&s;s Cecilia was well? Very well, was all Dolly's
an&s;wer. But I, who was determined he &s;hould know
a little more, blurted out, Ay, but you don't tell him
of the lover that Cecilia&mdash;Dolly looked, at me. I
clapped my hand upon my mouth, as if con&s;cious of
having done wrong. What a blab am I! cried I. A
blab, indeed! &s;aid Dolly, a little gravely; upon my
word, Mi&s;s Audley, I will never tru&s;t you again.
Falkland coloured up to the eyes; but affecting to
laugh, Prithee, who is this lover? &s;aid he. 'Tis no|thing
but a joke, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Arnold, yet I love
fidelity even in trifles.&mdash;I winked at Falkland, as
much as to &s;ay, A&s;k no more que&s;tions. He took my
meaning, and turned the conver&s;ation; but, as I ex|pected,
failed not to demand an explanation after Mi&s;s
Arnold was gone. <HI>I</HI> affected my&s;tery at fir&s;t; but
after much pre&s;&s;ing was at la&s;t <HI>prevailed,</HI> on to tell him,
that Cecilia had written her &s;i&s;ter word that &s;he was
addre&s;&s;ed by a gentleman of whom &s;he &s;poke very hand|&s;omely,
and who had made him&s;elf very acceptable to
lady Sarah Bidulph; but that till her mama was pro|perly
apprized of it, either by her lady&s;hip or Sir
George, &s;he de&s;ired the affair might not be mentioned
at all. Falkland a&s;ked the name of this lover; I told
him, that either Cecilia, had not named him, or if &s;he
had, Dolly had not thought proper to tru&s;t me with
it; and I begg'd of him never to &s;peak of the thing
to Mi&s;s Arnold, as it would only &s;erve to make her
<PB N="87" REF="89">
reproach me with my indi&s;cretion. He looked morti|fied;
but &s;aid I might depend on it he &s;hould not give
him&s;elf the <HI>trouble</HI> to make enquiries about a &s;ubject
in which he was <HI>no way concerned.</HI> Good, &s;aid I to
my&s;elf. If I be not mi&s;taken, young man, you will
become a lover in good earne&s;t out of pure &s;pite&mdash;Call
you not this advancing his amour, Edward?</P>
<P>[Here follows another &s;eries of letters between Sir
Edward and Mi&s;s Audley, which, for the &s;ame rea|&s;ons
before offered, are omitted, as they contain no|thing
more than reciprocal accounts of the progre&s;s
of their &s;chemes. Sir Edward mentions in &s;everal of
them that he had hopes of &s;ucceeding with Cecilia, as
lady Sarah not only admitted but encouraged his vi&s;its.
Mi&s;s Audley informs her brother that her young friend,

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mi&s;s AUDLEY to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Nov. 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IO, Io, triumphe! Oh, Edward, I wi&s;h thy vows
and Cecilia's were reciprocated with the &s;ame &s;o|lemnity,
as tho&s;e of Falkland and Mi&s;s Arnold were
la&s;t night. I knew it would, I knew it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> come to
that; and the lovers, without ab&s;olutely being married,
are hampered in the very ties we wi&s;hed them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold came to us ye&s;terday about five
o'clock; &s;he had got leave to go with my mama and
me to an a&s;&s;embly, and con&s;equently was to lie at
our hou&s;e that night, for Mrs. Arnold has indulged
her in greater liberties than u&s;ual on account of
<PB N="88" REF="90">
her &s;i&s;ter's ab&s;ence. My mama (as was preconcerted)
had gone out immediately after dinner <HI>She was &s;ent for
in a violent hurry to a lady, a particular friend of her's
who was in labour; there was no refu&s;ing &s;uch a &s;um|mons;
but &s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, return time enough to
go with us to the a&s;&s;embly.</HI> Falkland was with us by
appointment, and was to have attended us thither.</P>
<P>Dolly was dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t elegance, and
looked like an angel; but I &s;aw by her informed coun|tenance
the minute &s;he entered the room that &s;omething
di&s;turbed her. I made my mama's excu&s;es to her,
telling her, if &s;he could not di&s;engage her&s;elf time
enough from her friend, that I would, if Mi&s;s Arnold
cho&s;e it, endeavour to get &s;ome other married lady to
go with us. Suppo&s;e, &s;aid Falkland, we were to
change the &s;cheme of this evening's entertainments, and
in&s;tead of going to the &s;tupid a&s;&s;embly, pa&s;s the even|ing
where we are? With all my heart, an&s;wered I;
And mine, cried Mi&s;s Arnold, for I do not find my&s;elf at
pre&s;ent much di&s;po&s;ed for the amu&s;ements of &s;uch a place.</P>
<P>Falkland now approached her, and &s;itting down by
her, took her hand re&s;pectfully; Something has di&s;|concerted
you, my dear Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid he, I have
&s;een it in your looks ever &s;ince you came in; <HI>tell</HI>
me?&mdash;What's the matter?&mdash;There are certain per&s;ua|&s;ive
tones (of which Falkland is a perfect ma&s;ter) that
are not to be re&s;i&s;ted; he can, when he plea&s;es, a&s;&s;ume
a &s;weet plaintivene&s;s in his voice, that I have often
con&s;idered as a dangerous advantage. Dolly, I believe,
felt the force of it in that in&s;tant. She withdrew her
hand gently from his, and, not daring to confe&s;s the
true cau&s;e of her unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he replied, I am the
mo&s;t unfit per&s;on in the world for a life of hurry; you
cannot imagine how much my &s;pirits have been fluttered
to-day, to think of what a &s;cene of tumult and di&s;&s;i|pation
I am going to plunge into at my uncle Bidulph's,
for lady Sarah is never happy but in a crowd. You do
not as yet think of going to London? cried Falkland.
I apprehended Sir George purpo&s;ed not to return till
after Chri&s;tma&s;s. He has changed his mind, an&s;wered
Dolly, or rather lady Sarah has changed it for him; for
<PB N="89" REF="91">
they purpo&s;e &s;etting out together from Bath next Sun|day,
and the following week my uncle comes him&s;elf
to fetch me to town. I believe, added &s;he, Sir George
has a hu&s;band in his thoughts for my &s;i&s;ter, for he in|forms
my mama that my lord V&mdash;is now at Bath.
He be&s;tows great encomiums on him, and &s;ays that lady
V&mdash;and he have already given him to Cecilia, with
whom my lord is quite charmed; and this I &s;uppo&s;e
was the lover that Cecilia hinted at.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the blood mount in Falkland's cheeks; he
&s;eemed mortified,&mdash;but whether at the thoughts of
Cecilia's marriage, or at tho&s;e of lo&s;ing his conque&s;t
by Dolly's removing to London, I can't &s;ay; for I
know not whether love or vanity was in that moment
mo&s;t predominant. They were both &s;ilent for a little
while; Falkland's eyes were fixed on Mi&s;s Arnold,
her's were bent to the ground: and I perceived it was
with difficulty &s;he re&s;trained her tears. He &s;aw it too;
this was the time to &s;peak. You are going, madam,
&s;aid he, to receive the homage of all the world; this
ob&s;cure corner will be no longer in your thoughts, and
you will forget perhaps even the <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> with which
you have honoured me.&mdash;No!&mdash;was all Dolly
could reply; &s;he dared not to tru&s;t the &s;teadine&s;s of
her voice with any more; even this poor little mono|&s;yllable,
though uttered emphatically, was not rai&s;ed
above her breath. Again they were both &s;ilent, and I
waited with that kind of expectation, I believe, in my
face that tame fowls appear to have when they expect
a &s;hower. What would I then have given for a de|cent
pretence to have left the room! The juncture
&s;eemed &s;o critical, if let &s;lip perhaps it was irrecover|able.
In &s;hort, I was ju&s;t going to ri&s;e and leave them
without any pretence at all, when a loud rap at the
door offered me a very fair one; up I bounced from
my chair, and flew out of the parlour to order my&s;elf
to be denied, as I told them, having forgot to u&s;e this
precaution before; but one of the &s;ervants, happening
to be in the hall, had already opened the door, and
in ru&s;tled Mi&s;s Leatham. I led her into the little
drawing room, called for lights, and we both &s;at
<PB N="90" REF="92">
down. Right glad was I of her company, in&s;ipid a$
it is, as it afforded me a very good excu&s;e for ab|&s;enting
my&s;elf a while from the two friends, who,
I had rea&s;on to believe, would in that interval di&s;|cover
the fallacy of their Platonic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Leatham was going to the a&s;&s;embly; but as
&s;he is one of tho&s;e who affects coming in late to a pub|lic
place, &s;he cho&s;e to oblige me with her company
for half an hour before &s;he went. Having exhau&s;ted
her whole &s;tock of ideas, &s;he a&s;ked me (ob&s;erving I
was dre&s;&s;ed out) whether I did not mean to go to the
a&s;&s;embly? I told her it had been my intention, but
that a young lady who was to have gone with me, and
who was then in the hou&s;e, having been taken ill had
prevented my de&s;ign. This was a &s;ufficient hint, and
&s;he went away directly.</P>
<P>I returned to the parlour, and was very &s;oon con|vinced
that Falkland had not made a fooli&s;h u&s;e of his
time. Dolly had but ju&s;t time to withdraw her hand
from his lips, as I entered the room. You and I, Ed|ward,
who can read faces, would have wanted no o|ther
information of what had pa&s;&s;ed, than what we
could have learnt from both of theirs. On his, &s;at an
air of triumph, mingled with plea&s;ure and gratitude:
On her's complacency and redoubled tenderne&s;s, cha&s;|tened
by fear. He now a&s;&s;umed the conver&s;ation with
the utmo&s;t freedom, and rattled away on the &s;ubject
of my vi&s;iter (whom he knows very well) with that
kind of ea&s;e which a per&s;on di&s;covers, who having
happily di&s;patched &s;ome important concern that hung
on their mind, de&s;cends into the common affairs of
life with a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed with every thing.
Dolly, on the other hand, was &s;ilent, and even ap|peared
embarra&s;&s;ed; yet through this I could di&s;co|ver
an inward &s;atisfaction that proved to me her <HI>heart</HI>
was more at ea&s;e than before. <HI>She</HI> &s;eemed <HI>more</HI> re|&s;erved
than u&s;ual; Falkland, much <HI>le&s;s.</HI> He more
than once ventured to take her hand; &s;he con&s;tantly
withdrew it, yet her looks reprimanded not the free|dom.
Lord, how prettily fooli&s;h was all this! I
would have given &s;ix-pence for a lover my&s;elf; and
<PB N="91" REF="93">
had Cecilia and you been pre&s;ent, all the world to
nothing &s;he would have been your own; for, as I
told you before, Edward, we girls hate to be like
cyphers</P>
<P>My mama returned to &s;upper (&s;he could not po&s;&s;i|bly
get away from her friend &s;ooner.) We were all in|finitely
good humoured, but rather &s;illyi&s;h; for every
one was full of them&s;elves, though each a&s;ked que&s;ti|ons
of the other, about which they did not care a
pinch of &s;nuff to be informed. Falkland took his
leave at a very decent hour, and Mi&s;s Arnold and
I retired to my chamber, for &s;he cho&s;e to &s;leep with
me. When we were alone, Well, my dear? &s;aid
I. Oh, Sophy, (both her hands held up) what have
I done? <HI>What</HI> have you done, Dolly? no harm, I
am &s;ure.&mdash;I have given my&s;elf away! an irrevoca|ble
vow has pa&s;&s;ed my lips, never to be the wife
of any man but Falkland! Bravo! &s;aid I. Good
God, cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands together, are
you not &s;tartled at the phrenzy of this action? <HI>I</HI>
am frighted when I look back; how little ought we
to be tru&s;ted with our&s;elves? Oh, Mi&s;s Audley, you
left me in a fatal minute. Had I e&s;caped to-night,
I was determined never to have given Mr. Falk|land
another opportunity, for <HI>till</HI> to night he never
explained him&s;elf. And what &s;aid he to-night, Mi&s;s
Arnold? for hitherto, as far as I under&s;tand, (what|ever
his &s;ecret wi&s;hes might have been) he &s;eemed not
to <HI>claim</HI> more than friend&s;hip and e&s;teem from you.
Sophy, &s;aid &s;he, whil&s;t you live never contract a
friend&s;hip with a <HI>man;</HI> 'twas that deceitful word
which has en&s;nared me, and led me at la&s;t to bur&s;t
the bonds of filial duty, of confidence, of gratitude
to the be&s;t of mothers I&mdash;Cecilia too, what
will <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;ay to find her &s;i&s;ter &s;uch a ca&s;t-away? A
flood of tears now bur&s;t from her eyes. Have you
not, my dear, &s;aid I, received the vows of Falkland
in return? Oh yes, an&s;wered &s;he, yet I know not
how it came to pa&s;s. My mind was all a chaos, I
forgot every thing, I exi&s;ted but to him; and he ob|tained
<PB N="92" REF="94">
my promi&s;e before I was &s;en&s;ible that he had
demanded it. The moment you left the room, con|&s;cious
of my own weakne&s;s and terrified at my &s;itua|tion,
I bur&s;t into tears; Falkland wept at the &s;ame
time. I could not bear this; I &s;tarted up from my
chair, and would have ran out. I believe I &s;hould
have flown to you, my eyes all red as they were;
but he catched me by the hand,&mdash;You are go|ing,
my dear Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid he, you are going to
be the idol of a thou&s;and hearts, and I &s;hall be for|gotten.
Impo&s;&s;ible, I cried; Oh, Falkland! you
know too well that that is impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Say then,
&s;aid he, that I &s;hall never lo&s;e the place that I have
now the happine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s in your heart.&mdash;Sinking
almo&s;t into the earth with confu&s;ion, I &s;carcely arti|culated
the word, Never! Will you then be mine?
he demanded.&mdash;I know not what an&s;wer I return|ed;
an a&s;&s;ent no doubt it was, for he in&s;tantly (for
the fir&s;t time) took the liberty of &s;aluting me, and
then in the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions &s;wore he would live
only for me&mdash;Awaked as it were from a dream,
I cried out, What have I &s;aid? What has made me
the happie&s;t of men, he replied, you have promi&s;ed
to be mine only. See, Sophy, continued &s;he, into
what an irretrievable error a few &s;hort minutes may
betray us! He talked afterwards of a private marri|age,
hopele&s;s as he is of getting my friends con&s;ent;
but I conjured him not to &s;peak of that.&mdash;Why,
what do you mean to do, my dear? interrupted I:
&s;urely you purpo&s;e to fulfil your engagements to Falk|land?
Doubtle&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, I wed him or my grave;
yet how is it po&s;&s;ible for me all at once to determine
on a &s;tep &s;o ra&s;h, and but a few hours ago, &s;o unfore|&s;een?
We are both very young, we may wait a
while&mdash;Time, with the interpo&s;ition of a few com|pa&s;&s;ionate
friends, may do &s;omething in our favour.
I know my uncle has ambitious views both for my
&s;i&s;ter and me; but perhaps he may be &s;atisfied with
di&s;po&s;ing of Cecilia to a titled hu&s;band, and leave me
free to make an humbler choice. If my &s;i&s;ter &s;hould
<PB N="93" REF="95">
marry my lord V&mdash;I &s;topped her &s;hort here,
thinking it very expedient to throw in a &s;ea&s;onable
word for you; A propos, Dolly, &s;aid I, you imagine
that the lord V&mdash;was the namele&s;s lover whom
Cecilia hinted at in a former letter to you; but I am
of a quite different opinion, and rather &s;u&s;pect 'tis
my mad-cap of a brother. Though I affected to &s;ay
this very joco&s;ely, Mi&s;s Arnold &s;eemed &s;urprized, and
a&s;ked me why I thought &s;o; Becau&s;e, &s;aid I, I have
had a letter from him very lately, wherein he tells me
he has been at Bath for &s;ome time; but changes me
not to let my mama know it, as &s;he would be very
angry with him for ab&s;enting him&s;elf from my uncle
Howel. Well? &s;aid Mi&s;s Arnold. Well, &s;aid I,
and he &s;ays, that in order to drive you from his
thoughts, and be revenged of you at the &s;ame time,
he makes love to your &s;i&s;ter. This is &s;o like Sir Ed|ward!
continued I, laughing; but I can tell you, he
adds that Cecilia receives him kindly, and that he is
a great favourite of lady Sarah's; and really your
&s;i&s;ter's keeping his &s;ecret, which I &s;uppo&s;e he begg'd
of her to do, <HI>does</HI> carry with it an air of kindne&s;s.
'Tis very true, &s;aid Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;miling, and I am
very glad to find that the &s;light wound he received
from me is &s;o &s;oon healed. My brother, &s;aid I, is not
&s;o romantic as to love on without the hopes of a return;
but if Cecilia be di&s;po&s;ed to make him one, I in&s;i&s;t on
it, Dolly, that you do not endeavour to divert her in|clinations
from him, by telling her what has pa&s;&s;ed,
with regard to your&s;elf. Ah, Mi&s;s Audley! replied
&s;he, I have <HI>now</HI> no right to pre&s;cribe to my &s;i&s;ter; I
am too much humbled in my own eyes, to pre&s;ume to
be a monitor. There was &s;omething indignant in her
manner, like one who felt them&s;elves under the mor+tifying
nece&s;&s;ity of conforming (however repugnant to
their own &s;entiments) to the will of tho&s;e in who&s;e
power they have put them&s;elves. This, Edward, is
not the lea&s;t of tho&s;e evils to which we poor women
&s;ubject our&s;elves, when we deviate a little from the
very narrow and thorny paths of rectitude; but let Mi&s;s
<PB N="94" REF="96">
Arnold con&s;ider it thus if &s;he will, it makes for our
purpo&s;e; and one &s;ometimes obtains from fear, what
even friend&s;hip would deny, and gratitude it&s;elf would
refu&s;e. If Sir Edward, &s;aid I, is &s;o happy as to &s;uc|ceed
with Cecilia, it will pave the way for Falkland.
The di&s;parity between <HI>them</HI> is not &s;o great as between
your lover, and lord V&mdash;, and your choice would
not throw you at &s;uch a di&s;tance from your &s;i&s;ter; that
&s;ingle con&s;ideration &s;hould induce you to countenance
my brother's preten&s;ions; be&s;ides, the &s;trict friend&s;hip
between them will enable you to hear from, and per|haps
oftner to &s;ee Falkland than you could otherwi&s;e
expect.&mdash;No, Sophy, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;i&s;ter &s;hall never
have <HI>my</HI> example as an excu&s;e for di&s;obedience. If
Sir Edward wins her heart, I &s;hall not interpo&s;e be|tween
them, (though I do not think 'tis likely he
&s;hould ever obtain the &s;uffrage of my family) but
Cecilia &s;hall not have the frailty of her elder &s;i&s;ter to
plead in her excu&s;e for an imprudent choice; there|fore
be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall conceal my engagements with
Mr. Falkland as carefully from her, as I would from
the re&s;t of my friends, till the mo&s;t favourable oppor|tunity
&s;hall offer of divulging them. What a perver&s;e
determination is this, Edward! it has unhinged the
principal movement in our machine; yet my hope is,
that Dolly will not be able to keep her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But if after all the pains with which I have been la|bouring
for your intere&s;ts, my lord V&mdash;&s;hould &s;tep
in and &s;natch away the reward of our toil! The thought
is not to be borne; <HI>Have I for Banquo's I&s;&s;ue,</HI> &amp;c. Oh,
Edward, it re&s;ts upon the &s;ingle point of a young girl's
liking a &s;prightly young fellow of twenty-three, bet|ter
than an exceedingly grave man (the very rever&s;e of
her own temper) with the comfortable addition of, I
believe ten years more added to his age. That's
&s;omething yet;&mdash;but I like not his preten&s;ions, and
wi&s;h he had &s;taid in Germany.</P>
<P>My mama propo&s;es going to London in about a
fortnight. I &s;uppo&s;e you will &s;oon join us there, and
as you &s;tand &s;o well with lady Sarah, the way is open
<PB N="95" REF="97">
to you, at lea&s;t as far as acce&s;s to Cecilia will carry
you. When Falkland comes to town, I take it for
granted, you will fix him at our hou&s;e. Our acquaint|ance
(my mama's and mine I mean) is but &s;light with
lady Sarah Bidulph, yet we mean to cultivate it; the
two girls, of cour&s;e, will be often with us. Cecilia
mu&s;t then nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cover (&s;pight of her &s;i&s;ter) how
matters &s;tand between her and Falkland. What then
will become of Dolly's wi&s;e precautions? And who
knows but the path may look &s;o flowery to the young|er,
as may tempt her &s;teps to wander as far as we are
di&s;po&s;ed to lead her?&mdash;Adieu, my dear Edward;

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Bath, <DATE>Nov 8th</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AND &s;o Mi&s;s Arnold has given her&s;elf to Falk|land;
an irrevocable vow has pa&s;&s;ed her lips,
is't not &s;o? Oh, tho&s;e ruby lips! Well, let him take
her; and now to other bu&s;ine&s;s, for I am in a horrid
ill humour. The Bidulphs &s;et off this morning for
London, and have taken my little girl with them. I
have lo&s;t &s;ince I came to this &s;curvy place&mdash;more
than I'll tell you; for though none of the &s;ober
ones knew of my playing, I fell in with a &s;et here
who u&s;ed to meet every night in a private room, and,
cur&s;e them, they have &s;tripped me. Another thou|&s;and
deep &s;ince I left Oxford. But this is not the
wor&s;t, the rival I have got is a devili&s;h formidable one.
That &s;ame lord V&mdash;, who came down hither to pay
his duty (as the old beldames call it) to his mother,
dares to eye my Cecilia; but, thank heaven, &s;he &s;eems
utterly regardle&s;s of him; yet is he one of tho&s;e plau|&s;ible
<PB N="96" REF="98">
curs, that all your mothers, and aunts, and co$|&s;ins
would be for hampering directly in lawful wed|lock
with any young thing of whom they had to di&s;|po&s;e.
Be&s;ides; he is an earl, Sophy, and I being but
a &s;imple baronet, he con&s;equently mounts three &s;teps
higher on the ladder of lady Sarah's good graces.
Sir George (with a vengeance to him!) invited his vi|&s;its
in town. Oh, to be &s;ure his lord&s;hip does not
<HI>mean</HI> to drop the acquaintance.&mdash;Now could I
drink hot blood! and utter &s;uch imprecations on
them all! I tell you Sophy, I am de&s;perate, and if a
change is not wrought and that &s;uddenly in my for|tune,
I know not to what extremities I may be driven,
If I find this interloper is likely to &s;natch away the
fruits of our long laboured proce&s;s, by my &s;oul, I'll &s;nap
up Cecilia at the fir&s;t &s;hort turn I meet her, and leave i$
to her own good-nature, and Mrs Arnold's <HI>chri&s;tia|nity</HI>
to work out my pardon. Falkland, at the &s;ame
time, may carry off <HI>his</HI> legal prize. What a glorious
triumph would this be over the in&s;olent blood of the
Bidulphs! I &s;hall leave Bath directly, and make
&s;traight to London, without returning to Oxford, as
I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>[Here, in the order of the manu&s;cript, follow &s;ome
letters which pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Falkland and Mi&s;s
Arnold after the latter had gone to London, tho&s;e to

Sophy and I talk whole hours of you. Sir Edward

<P>&startq;ONE of the be&s;t of girls in the world,&endq; you
&s;ay I am. My dear mama, tho&s;e are the
kind words with which your la&s;t letter was clo&s;ed.
I wi&s;h I may continue to de&s;erve that character,
for indeed I am &s;o flattered and &s;o care&s;&s;ed that
I am in great danger of being &s;poiled. I am the
darling of lady Sarah; and only my uncle Bidulph is
fonder of my &s;i&s;ter than he is of me, my vanity would
carry me away for want of a little balla&s;t.</P>
<P>I have now no le&s;s than <HI>four</HI> lovers. Dolly is &s;o
exceedingly retired (for &s;he hates company) that &s;he
has not one, at lea&s;t not one who has ventured to
declare him&s;elf. Lady Sarah calls her a prude, and
&s;ays &s;he freezes the men with her cold looks. My
uncle &s;wears &s;he is hand&s;omer than I am, to which
opinion I very readily &s;ub&s;cribe.&mdash;Well, but about
the&s;e four lovers&mdash;be&s;ides the three I mentioned to
you before, lord V&mdash;'s name now graces my li&s;t. He
is come to town, has been &s;everal times to vi&s;it us,
and has &s;aid &s;uch fine things to me! Dear mama, you
can't imagine what a fool they make of me. My
&s;pirits hurry me away, and I know you love my idle
prattle, yet I am di&s;po&s;ed to be very grave at this
minute, for I &s;u&s;pect there are &s;erious de&s;igns going
forward. My three fir&s;t lovers I laughed at, but my
fourth, I am afraid, will vex me. Both Sir George
and lady Sarah &s;peak of him as of a de&s;irable alli|ance;
but remember I tell you, mama, I do not like
lord V&mdash;, and I am &s;ure you will never con&s;train
your own poor Cecilia. My &s;i&s;ter approves mightily
of him. I think he would make an excellent hu&s;band
for her, for &s;he is as &s;ober as he, and &s;he would have
no objection to his being twelve or fourteen years
older than her&s;elf.&mdash;She looks over my &s;houlder, and

&s;ays, &startq;No indeed, I &s;hould not.&endq;&mdash;Well, then take
him, Dolly, for I can &s;pare him. Here, my dear ma|ma,

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mi&s;s CECILIA ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Dec. 22d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CONTINUE, my dear, continue to cheri&s;h
tho&s;e charming &s;pirits that make you &s;o agree|able
to all your friends, and which were the &s;upport
of my life during my melancholy vi&s;it at Burnly. But
beware, Cecilia, of letting them run away with you.
I am not afraid of your vanity; your good &s;en&s;e will
be a &s;ufficient counterbalance to that, though your uncle
were even as partial to you as he is to your &s;i&s;ter. I
am not therefore afraid of your vanity, I &s;ay, but I
am afraid of your caprice; for is there not &s;omething
of that, child, in a re&s;olution &s;o &s;uddenly formed not
to like lord V&mdash;? for &s;o I mu&s;t con&s;true your words;
and &s;ure I am 'tis impo&s;&s;ible you can have any <HI>rational</HI>
objection to him.</P>
<P>I remember him a boy when he fir&s;t went into the
army. He was then remarkably hand&s;ome, and time
cannot have wrought &s;uch a change in a man not
over thirty,&mdash;but that he mu&s;t &s;till retain a very
agreeable per&s;on. And for his character, 'tis &s;uch as
mu&s;t recommend him to every one of under&s;tanding
and virtue. I would not con&s;train you, Cecilia; no,
far be it from your affectionate parent's heart to con|&s;train
<PB N="99" REF="101">
&s;o obedient a child; but I would <HI>advi&s;e</HI> you,
my dear, advi&s;e you for your good.</P>
<P><HI>Advice</HI> from a mother was always con&s;idered by
<HI>me</HI> as a <HI>command:</HI> yet I do not de&s;ire you to regard it
in &s;o &s;evere a light. We have been educated dif|ferently.
You were always treated with the kinde&s;t
indulgence, with all rea&s;onable allowances made for
the inadvertence of youth, and the overboiling &s;pirits
which your natural vivacity has given you. I, on
the other hand, though tenderly beloved by my ever
honoured mother, had, neverthele&s;s, my neck early
bowed to obedience; and this it was which con|&s;trained
me to yield up my neare&s;t wi&s;hes, and, as it
were, mould my heart to the will of her to whom I
thought I owed all duty. Perhaps your grand-mama
exacted too much of me; for at the time Mr. Arnold
was propo&s;ed to me as a hu&s;band, &s;he knew I enter|tained
more than a bare inclination for another object;
but this is not your ca&s;e, Cecilia; your young heart
has not, it cannot have had the opportunity of en|gaging
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why then reject an offer &s;o honourable, &s;o advan|tageous,
&s;o de&s;irable in the eyes of all your friends?
I am the more &s;erious on this occa&s;ion, my dear, be|cau&s;e
I have very lately received a letter from lady
V&mdash;her&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ubject. She tells me her
&s;on was (to u&s;e her own words) &s;mitten by you the
moment he &s;aw you; the account he received of your
fortune and your education, probably, did not damp
his growing inclination. Lady V&mdash;&s;ays in her letter,
&startq;If you will tru&s;t to the judgment of a parent not ex|tremely
partial to lord V&mdash;he is a very valuable
young man, and in every re&s;pect worthy of being
my dear Mrs. Arnold's &s;on.&endq; The&s;e were her affec|tionate
expre&s;&s;ions; and &s;he added, &startq;How delighted
&s;hould I be to call you &s;i&s;ter!&endq; See then, my love,
what a pro&s;pect is opened before you of making your&s;elf,
of making your whole family happy! Yet <HI>remember,</HI>
Cecilia, (I retort your own words back on you) I do
not con&s;train you. I repeat it once more, I never will;
though I &s;hould be &s;orry my daughter could not give
<PB N="100" REF="102">
a more &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on than mere whim, for refu|&s;ing
a man &s;o unobjectionable as lord V&mdash;. Tell my
dear Dolly, I do not think &s;he has the le&s;s merit for
not having &s;o many <HI>admirers</HI> as her little lively &s;i&s;ter.
I am &s;ure &s;he has as many <HI>lovers,</HI> and perhaps Cecilia
ought to be more mortified than proud, that &s;he has
&s;o many <HI>declared</HI> ones.</P>
<P>My brother and lady Sarah have my warme&s;t wi&s;hes.
Mr. Price ki&s;&s;es both your hands, and my Orlando,
who was here when I received your la&s;t letter, and to
whom I read it, &s;ays he hopes &s;oon, in per&s;on, to do
the &s;ame. Receive both of you, my dear children,
the tendere&s;t love, as well ardent prayers for your

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>December 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW I cur&s;e my &s;tars for what is pa&s;t! how
cur&s;e my own folly, my own vanity, my own
childi&s;h pity, and weak re&s;entment! but above all,
how I cur&s;e you! yes, <HI>you,</HI> who&s;e blind officious
meddling friend&s;hip combined with them all to undo
me. Did I not tell you in the beginning I loved Ce|cilia,
that I adored her, and that I felt nothing for
her &s;i&s;ter beyond the warmth of friend&s;hip? Why did
you awaken my compa&s;&s;ion, by di&s;covering to me
that &s;he loved me? Why did you encourage me to
feed a flame that I never thought of kindling, that I
never wi&s;hed, that I never meant to return? This,
this is what I accu&s;e you of; but the charge I have
again&s;t my&s;elf is &s;till more flagrant. I acknowledge
my&s;elf coxcomb enough to have been plea&s;ed with the
conque&s;t of a heart on which I &s;et not the lea&s;t value;
I acknowledge my&s;elf fool enough to have in &s;ome
moments mi&s;taken mere compa&s;&s;ion for love; and I
<PB N="101" REF="103">
own my&s;elf tra$$or enough to have &s;uffered the &s;imple
effu&s;ions of gratitude to pa&s;s upon an innocent crea|ture
for the genuine expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion. My pride
urged me on again&s;t inclination, and I felt a &s;ecret
plea&s;ure at the thoughts of humbling Sir George
Bidulph, by triumphing in the affections of her whom
he calls the <HI>boa&s;t</HI> of his family. See here the &s;ource
of all my actions, de&s;picable &s;ot that I was, thus to
let &s;uch paltry pa&s;&s;ions wind me about like a machine!
That fatal letter, written by the arrogant and ill-bo|ding
pen of Bidulph, put the fini&s;hing hand to my
de&s;truction. <HI>He had already given my Cecilia to lord
V</HI>&mdash;, he &s;aid. Cecilia her&s;elf tells her &s;i&s;ter &s;he had a
lover; cruel and thoughtle&s;s as &s;he was, why did &s;he
not then &s;ay that &s;he hated him? What a load of remor&s;e
would that declaration have &s;pared me! I thought
<HI>her</HI> irretrievably lo&s;t to <HI>me;</HI> her &s;i&s;ter's tenderne&s;s af|fected
me; jealou&s;y and indignation, mingling with
gratitude and pity, lit up a momentary fire in my
heart. I offered vows to Mi&s;s Arnold, which that
heart, treacherous to its ma&s;ter as well as her, forced
me in the in&s;tant to think &s;incere. I received hers in
return, too, too &s;incere, I am afraid they are, for
&s;uch a villain! For will you not think me one? will
you not even call me one, when I tell you, that the
next day all my indifference for her returned, and I
&s;ound nothing in my heart but rancour again&s;t the
happier lord V&mdash;?</P>
<P>The letters I have con&s;tantly received from her
&s;ince, filled with tenderne&s;s and faith, reproach me
in every line. How difficult do I find it to frame my
an&s;wers! for I am not yet hardened enough in deceit
not to be &s;hocked at profe&s;&s;ing a love which I do not
feel; for, &s;pight of all my efforts, I find that Cecilia
holds her fir&s;t place in my heart. I have oftentimes
been half di&s;tracted with this thought; but &s;omething
occurred ye&s;terday which has made me de&s;perate. I
happened to be with Mrs. Arnold when &s;he received a
letter from Cecilia; wherein &s;he tells her mother po&s;i|tively
that &s;he <HI>cannot like lord V</HI>&mdash;. How delighted
was I with this declaration, till I recollected my own
<PB N="102" REF="104">
fatal engagements! But this is not all; &s;he mentioned
other lovers. I demanded of Mrs. Arnold who they
were. She named, as one of them, Sir <HI>Edward
Audley.</HI> Sir Edward Audley the lover of Cecilia!
the baby-face, who&s;e beauty was not to be compared
to that of her &s;i&s;ter! I could &s;tab you for daring to
think of her; and nothing &s;aves you from my venge|ance,
but Cecilia's indifference for you.</P>
<P>I am half mad, Sir Edward; &s;o take nothing ill
that I &s;ay. I dread the &s;ight of Mi&s;s Arnold; but I
a thou&s;and times more dread the invincible Cecilia,
who&s;e heart, perhaps, is &s;till at liberty. What a
&s;torm has this thought rai&s;ed in my bo&s;om! I &s;hall
come to town in a few days, and woe be to him I
find a &s;ucce&s;sful rival! for I tell you, I would rather
&s;ee Cecilia dead than in the arms of another.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>December 23d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HA, ha, ha, ha, poor Falkland! And &s;o it is vi|&s;ited
with compunction and remor&s;e! All the
bugbears that old Price u&s;ed to conjure up, in order
to frighten you in the nur&s;ery, have followed you, I
find, to the univer&s;ity. Oh, fy, fy, Orlando! I am
quite a&s;hamed of you. I thought I had left you pret|ty
well fortified again&s;t the&s;e &s;ort of &s;opperies when I
went to Wales; but I &s;ee there is no tru&s;ting &s;uch a
half-fledged &s;inner to him&s;elf; for no &s;ooner is my
back turned, than whip you take your con&s;cience
out from between the leaves of your Bible, where
you keep it like your band, for fear of being rump|led,
and <HI>like</HI> that, after a game of romps, you clap it
on again, to vi&s;it your grave acquaintance; but why
put it on to me, boy, who like you &s;o much better
di&s;habille? I do think thou art the mo&s;t whim&s;ical
fellow that ever I met with in my life; the dog in
<PB N="103" REF="105">
the manger was thy prototype. Why what a &s;narling
our art thou, to begrudge lord V&mdash;and me a little
$word$ at what thou can&s;t not touch thy&s;elf? But your
great con&s;olation is, that this dainty mor&s;el is out of
the reach of us both; for, by her own confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he
does not care a farthing for either of us. I do firmly
believe it, Falkland; and &s;o things are ju&s;t as they
were before we &s;et out: for as for your vows, and
your gratitude, and your villainy, and your &s;en&s;ibili|ty,
and your perfidy, and your repentance, 'tis all
&s;uch a bead-roll of Arnoldian non&s;en&s;e, that I blu&s;h
to hear a fellow of your &s;pirit talk thus like a 'pren|tice-boy
making his la&s;t &s;peech at Tyburn, and bid|ding
the good people beware of evil company, which
had cau&s;ed his downfal, and brought him unto that
&s;hameful end. You accu&s;e <HI>me</HI> fir&s;t and then your&s;elf;
exactly the malefactor's cant. But pray, my penitent
youth, what have either of us done to de&s;erve con|demnation?
Thus the affair &s;tands between us; I
find out by chance that a fine girl is in love with you
(by the way I liked her my&s;elf, and would have given
a limb to have been in your place;) but jealou&s;y and
rival&s;hip giving way to friend&s;hip, I acquaint you
with your good fortune, and advi&s;e you, as I would
have done my own brother, to make the mo&s;t of it.
Was there any harm in this; pray? You tell me, you
love the &s;i&s;ter of the lady. I a&s;k you, did you ever
receive any encouragement from her? ever make any
addre&s;&s;es to her? or, in &s;hort, have you any hopes
of obtaining her? No, no, no, was the an&s;wer to
the&s;e three que&s;tions. I bid you quit the &s;hadow,
and pur&s;ue the &s;ub&s;tance. Was not that the advice
of a friend? yet this it is for which I am to be cur&s;ed
by bell, book, and candle!</P>
<P>As for your own part, what has pa&s;&s;ed between
you and Mi&s;s Arnold, yon know be&s;t. If matters
have been brought to a conclu&s;ion, why I have no
more to &s;ay; but if, on the contrary, the nymph is
in &s;tatu quo, and you make all this fu&s;s of &s;elf-con|demnation
about a few &s;illy oaths, and lover's pro|te&s;tations,
you are even below pity, and fit for no|thing
<PB N="104" REF="106">
but to &s;cribble mi&s;erable ballads, &startq;&s;hewing
how a young maiden's gho&s;t came and tore out the
eyes of her fal&s;e &s;weetheart.&endq; Why, thou filly gen|tleman,
do&s;t let a vow &s;tick in thy throat? What the
plague <HI>is</HI> a vow? for hang me if I know. I know
what it is to &s;wear roundly, in order to make a wo|man
believe that I &s;hall love <HI>her,</HI> and <HI>only</HI> her, as
long as I live; and I have made many a dam&s;el (by way
of carrying on the farce) &s;wear as many to me in re|turn;
but it never once entered into my imagination
that &s;he expected I &s;hould <HI>keep</HI> tho&s;e oaths, no more
than I expected &s;he &s;hould keep hers, longer than we
liked each other. If the&s;e be what you call <HI>vows,</HI> I
have made and broke as many of them as mo&s;t pri|vate
gentlemen in England; but I don't remember
that ever even my &s;lumbers were haunted by the in|jured
nymphs.&mdash;Ay, but the ca&s;e is different: <HI>My</HI>
nymph is immaculate! Diana her&s;elf was but a flirt
to her. I make this an&s;wer for <HI>you,</HI> Falkland, be|cau&s;e
I take it for granted your courage never carried
you farther than the back of her white hand. If that
be &s;o, then pray what is &s;he the wor&s;e for your
<HI>vows?</HI> You &s;quandered away a little breath on her,
and got nothing but breath in return. Oh, but to
break one's promi&s;e! one's oaths! Suckling, who
ever thought that an oath made to a woman was
binding? the creatures them&s;elves don't expect it. Is
not the mo&s;t &s;olemn of all oaths, the matrimonial
oath, violated every day? Is the hu&s;band thought
the wor&s;e for infidelities to his wife? and would not
the wife be laughed at who complained of them?
I am amazed that you, who judge &s;o well in other
things, &s;till retain &s;ome very fal&s;e notions of honour.
I flattered my&s;elf that I had taught you pretty well
how to di&s;tingui&s;h; but I &s;ee how difficult it is total|ly
to eraze early wrong impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>As for Sir Edward Audley's being the lover of
Cecilia (which you mark with a point of admiration
as long as the Monument) what is there &s;o very ex|traordinary
in it? Sir Edward Audley is the lover of
every pretty woman he &s;ees. 'Tis true, I liked her
<PB N="105" REF="107">
&s;i&s;ter better; but finding you had &s;tepped into her
heart before me, I gave up the thoughts of her;
and &s;uppo&s;ing your <HI>intere&s;t</HI> might fix you where you
were, I looked upon Cecilia as a right of commonage,
and that I was free to nibble on the borders, without
encroaching on any body's ground; but I'll tell you
fairly, I have not now any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. I
&s;ay not this, Falkland, to deprecate your threatened
vengeance. Had I hopes of winning the fair, I would
u&s;e thee and thy vengeance for my &s;port, yea, for my
laughter. But the truth is, I want you to join me
in a noble enterprize I have conceived, no le&s;s than
the carrying off, by force or &s;tratagem, tho&s;e two
mi&s;chievous beauties; and when we have them in
our power, you may take your choice of them; for I
am humble enough to be content with which ever of
them &s;hall fall to my lot.</P>
<P>This lord V&mdash;is the mignion of the odious Bi|dulph
pair, and all their adherents; and notwith|&s;tanding
Cecilia likes him not, &s;he may be borne down
by per&s;ua&s;ions to accept him. Think of her being
lady V&mdash;, lo&s;t to your hopes for ever! and her
poor &s;i&s;ter either condemned to virginity, or thrown
away upon a fellow who takes her for mere pity. In
this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t <HI>all</HI> be di&s;contented; Cecilia mu&s;t
be di&s;contented in being married to a man &s;he does
not like; my lord V&mdash;, who &s;ets up to have what
the ladies call delicacy, to be &s;ure mu&s;t be di&s;con|tented,
without the heart of his wife. The&s;e, you
&s;ee, is one couple mi&s;erable. It will be the &s;ame with
regard to you and Mi&s;s Arnold. <HI>You</HI> will &s;igh for
Cecilia in the arms of her &s;i&s;ter; and &s;he, poor ten|der
&s;oul, will break her heart, at finding &s;he is not
beloved by her hu&s;band; &s;o there is another couple
for you unhappy. And for my&s;elf, I &s;hall be ready
to knock my brains out at my own di&s;appointment.
Now in the other way, at lea&s;t <HI>half</HI> the mi&s;chief will
be &s;aved. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cecilia makes <HI>you</HI> as
happy as a god. I &s;hall be &s;ufficiently contented, for
a mortal, with her &s;i&s;ter; and I'll be &s;acrificed, if
both the girls, in time, won't grow very fond of us;
<PB N="106" REF="108">
or, at wor&s;t, if they &s;hould be perver&s;e enough to
continue indifferent, the indifference would be of the
be&s;t &s;ide; for the poor dears, tramelled as they have
always been with the notions of duty, would never
once take it into their heads that there were any
con&s;olatory wanderings beyond the matrimonial
pale.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have made it appear as clear as
the &s;un, that no one would &s;uffer materially but lord
V&mdash;; for which, I fancy, neither you nor I &s;hould
have very deep regrets. But the glory of our tri|umph
would be in the di&s;comfiture of the Bidulphs;
when if, like a brace of towering falcons, we could
&s;ouce upon our prey, and bear away, like trembling
doves, the two young Arnolds in our &s;trong pounces!
The very idea lifts me above the clouds! Do&s;t not
thou, Falkland, kindle at the thought? Ha&s;ten to town
then, thou dreamer, and do not fit &s;ighing and moping
in the chimney-corner, and raving of what you call
the <HI>pa&s;t.</HI> What is the pa&s;t but an idle thodomon|tade,
never to be thought of more? Think of the
pre&s;ent, think of what's to come, think of Cecilia,
think of your friend, and that one bold &s;troke makes
us both happy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir GEORGE BIDULPH to Mrs. ARNOLD.
Dear Si&s;ter,
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Dec. 26th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE many avocations in which I am perpetual|ly
engaged, prevent me from being &s;o punctual
a corre&s;pondent as I otherwi&s;e &s;hould be. Indeed I
can &s;carce prevail upon my&s;elf to take up a pen, but
upon important occa&s;ions, &s;uch as I con&s;ider this on
which I am going to write.</P>
<P>Your daughter Cecilia, I &s;uppo&s;e, may have in|formed
you that my lord V&mdash;makes his addre&s;&s;es
to her, under my &s;anction, which I concluded I might
<PB N="107" REF="109">
venture to give him, without previou&s;ly con&s;ultiug
you, who, I am &s;ure, cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any ob|jection
to him. I am very willing to allow a young
lady all the indulgence which the levity of youth re|quires,
and all the homage which beauty exacts; but
this mu&s;t not be carried too far, and a man of lord
V&mdash;'s rank, and unque&s;tionable merit, is not to be
treated on the footing of a Sir Edward Audley. I am
&s;orry Cecilia, knows &s;o little how to di&s;tingui&s;h, and
that &s;he has hitherto paid no more regard to the real
pa&s;&s;ion of a worthy as well as very amiable man,
than &s;he does to the fluttering preten&s;ions of that very
in&s;ignificant boy. Sidney, this is not an offer to be
trifled with; and the very noble propo&s;als which lord
V&mdash;makes, are &s;uch as may not fall in our way
every day. I &s;hould be very unwilling to interpo&s;e
parental authority on this occa&s;ion; but where a gid|dy
girl does not know how to chu&s;e for her&s;elf, 'tis the
duty of her friends to chu&s;e for her. Cecilia can
have no previous engagements; at lea&s;t her &s;i&s;ter
knows of none in Oxford&s;hire, and lady Sarah is cer|tain
&s;he could have contracted none at Bath, as &s;he was
never from under her own eye; and &s;he profe&s;&s;es the
utmo&s;t indifference for every man with whom &s;he has
become acquainted &s;ince &s;he came to town. What is
it then but vanity, and a love of admiration, that can
make her aver&s;e to the thoughts of marrying? Lord
V&mdash;is pa&s;t the age of dangling; yet is he &s;o much
in love with this mad-cap, that he admires even her
faults. I would not here be under&s;tood to mean that
&s;he has any thing really blameable in her conduct;
on the contrary, I think her an admirably good girl,
and when &s;he comes to be a little more &s;erious, will
mane any man happy who has the good fortune to
plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;had thoughts of going to pay you a
vi&s;it; in which de&s;ign I prevented him, as I imagine
his lord&s;hip has a much longer journey to take to
Mi&s;s Cecilia's heart. I told him, there was no doubt
of obtaining your con&s;ent, if he could win that of
your daughter. I mu&s;t, therefore, reque&s;t it of you,
<PB N="108" REF="110">
Sidney, that you will write to her <HI>&s;trongly</HI> on the
&s;ubject. I find &s;he has one &s;ubterfuge, to which &s;he
always flies whenever I urge her on this point. My
mama, &s;he cries, would not pre&s;s me to what I di&s;|like.
I am afraid this indulgence of yours may be
productive of con&s;equences as di&s;agreeable in their
effects as the too ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of her mama was
upon another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah is very much yours. Neither of my
nieces know of my writing to you; but I am &s;ure
they both love and honour you.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
Dear Brother,
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Dec. 28th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU did but ju&s;tice to lord V&mdash;'s worth, in
&s;uppo&s;ing I <HI>could</HI> have no objection to him. I
<HI>have</HI> none; on the contrary, I &s;hould look upon his
alliance as an honour both to my daughter and me.
I love his excellent mother, and revere the memory
of his good father, to whom I had obligations never
to be forgotten. I have but little per&s;onal knowledge
of my lord him&s;elf; but know enough of his charac|ter
to make me wi&s;h to &s;ee him united to us by the
clo&s;e&s;t ties. It is with equal &s;urprize and concern I
hear Cecilia is aver&s;e to him. A <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> cau&s;e of
di&s;like &s;he cannot have; I therefore am in hopes that
time and a little per&s;everance on my lord's &s;ide will
overcome her reluctance. I have written to her on
the &s;ubject in &s;uch a manner as, I believe, you will
approve. The <HI>authority</HI> of a parent I never will ex|ert;
too dearly have I my&s;elf experienced the con&s;e|quences
of &s;uch a proceeding; but as far as remon|&s;trance,
advice, and admonition goes, I have not been
&s;paring. I am under a promi&s;e to both my children
never to urge their acceptance of a man whom they
<PB N="109" REF="111">
did not like; but <HI>my</HI> punctilio does not bind <HI>you.</HI>
You are therefore at liberty to u&s;e every means (ab|&s;olute
force excepted) to prevail on Cecilia to receive
as &s;he ought &s;o advantageous an offer. I own I could
have wi&s;hed that Dolly had been, lord V&mdash;'s choice,
as I think her &s;edate temper would have &s;uited him
better; and I am &s;ure her gentle and complying di&s;po|&s;ition
would have yielded, without repugnance, to
the will of her friends; but as we cannot direct the
heart where to make an election, and my. lord V&mdash;
has already fixed his, we have nothing more in our
power than to endeavour, by every warrantable me|thod,
to procure for him &s;uch a return as he de|&s;erves.</P>
<P>I &s;alute lady Sarah with my be&s;t regards, and am,

<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA. B&mdash;to Mrs. ARNOLD.
[The letter to which this is an an&s;wer is omitted, as
the &s;ub&s;tance of it may be gathered from the fol|lowing.]
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Jan. 3d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Know not what to do with this negociation in
which you have employed me, my dear Sidney.
I find Cecilia &s;trangely aver&s;e to lord V&mdash;, yet I
cannot get from her any &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons for her
di&s;like. Both your daughters were with me on Mon|day,
by invitation, and I entered heartily into the
&s;ubject. Is he not, &s;aid I, (&s;peaking of lord V&mdash;)
a very hand&s;ome man? (the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, you
know, with mo&s;t girls:) Yes, certainly, the man's
not ami&s;s as to per&s;on. A very accompli&s;hed man?
<PB N="110" REF="112">
No doubt of it? he &s;peaks &s;everal living languages,
and, for aught I know, may be an excellent &s;cholar
and a rare mu&s;ician. Extremely well bred, and per|fectly
good tempered? The man's civil, and I never
&s;aw him angry. The monkey would give her own
flippant an&s;wers. Of unexceptionable, morals? She
turned her eyes at me with &s;o arch a look, that I
could &s;carce refrain from laughing. I know nothing
to the contrary, madam. Has not he a fine e&s;tate? I
do not want money, Mrs. B&mdash;. Of a con&s;iderable
family, and noble rank? I de&s;ire not titles either.
What then <HI>do</HI> you de&s;ire, Cecilia? Only to plea&s;e
my&s;elf; and &s;he &s;hook her little head &s;o, that all the
powder and the curls in her hair fell about her face,
and I never beheld &s;uch a pretty wild figure in my
life. Mi&s;s Arnold reproved her; Cecilia, you are
too giddy. Dolly, you are too grave, the other re|plied.
I have nothing but my &s;pirits to &s;upport my
courage; for indeed, my dear Mrs. B&mdash;, I am &s;adly
teized by my uncle about this &s;ame lord V&mdash;. I
wi&s;h he had &s;taid where he was, or that he had
made choice of my &s;i&s;ter in&s;tead of me; &s;he is the
<HI>very</HI> thing for him. She then flew to my harp&s;ichord,
rattled away a tune on it, then turning round, &s;he
began a minuet, &s;inging to her&s;elf, and danced two or
three turns round the room with inimitable &s;pirit and
grace. In &s;hort, there is no being angry with this
girl for any thing; for 'tis &s;uch a bewitching little
gip&s;ey, that I believe &s;he could, per&s;uade any one to
be of her way of thinking. I made two or three more
efforts to renew the conver&s;ation, but could not get
her to be &s;erious. Sir George &s;ent his coach for them
at eight o'clock. When &s;he was going away, You
think me very wild &s;aid &s;he; but I have my hours of
&s;adne&s;s. For what, my dear? Oh, you will know
all in time, in a low voice, as &s;he curt&s;ied to take her
leave; and down &s;he flew like a lapwing.</P>
<P>I find I did not know this girl, from what I &s;aw of
her in your pre&s;ence. Re&s;trained, perhaps, a little
by that circum&s;tance, &s;he gave not &s;uch full &s;cope to
her vivacity; yet how charming is that vivacity,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
when joined to &s;o much innocence and &s;weetne&s;s of
temper as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es! I do not wonder that &s;he at|tracts
more than Dolly, though (in my eye) &s;he is a
more captivating beauty; yet the other is the ignis
fatuus for the men to follow. But now I &s;peak of
Dolly, indeed, my dear, I am afraid that poor young
creature has &s;ome &s;ecret malady lurking about her,
though &s;he her&s;elf is not &s;en&s;ible of it. Her dejection
of &s;pirits &s;eems increa&s;ed, and her looks con&s;iderably
altered for the wor&s;e, &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw her at Wood|berry.
She &s;ays, the late hours &s;he is obliged to keep
at your, brother's, do not at all agree with her.
There may be &s;omething in this; yet I &s;hall give lady
Sarah the &s;ame advice, that I once before gave you,
viz. to con&s;ult with &s;ome phy&s;ician about her. Mr.
B&mdash;and I are to dine with her to-day, and I will
keep this letter open till my return in the evening.
Perhaps I may have &s;omething worth adding, as what
I have &s;aid above is &s;o little &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, <DATE>Jan. 4th.</DATE></P>
<P>I have indeed &s;omething to add, my dear, which,
I am afraid, will not be very plea&s;ing to you, yet
&s;uch as it is, you mu&s;t have it. We dined ye&s;terday
(as I told you we intended) at Sir George's. An in|tolerable
crowd there was. Lord V&mdash;, Lady Audley,
and Mi&s;s, were part of the company, and &s;even or
eight more with whom I had &s;carce any acquaintance.
After dinner we adjourned to the drawing-room,
where the card-tables were placed, for lady Sarah
&s;aid we were a &s;nug little party. We had not yet &s;at
down to-cards, but were &s;till &s;ipping our tea; every
one had got into &s;eparate parties; Cecilia, armed at
all points, &s;at like a little divinity dealing her &s;hafts
about her; a lover on each hand, lord V&mdash;on this,
Sir Edward Audley (who had dropped in after dinner)
on the other; an each of whom &s;he &s;eemed to be&s;tow
an equal &s;hare of her attention, her good humour,
and her wit. Lady Sarah with &s;ome other ladies
had entered into a di&s;&s;ertation on a new Per&s;ian car|pet,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
which had for the fir&s;t time been that very day
&s;pread on the floor. My &s;overeign lord, who had en|gaged
in a political di&s;pute at dinner, had brought
the argument up &s;tairs with him, and was re-tracing
it to a little auditory of his own. Mi&s;s Arnold and
I were &s;itting together, and Sir. George, playing with
my fan, was &s;tanding before us talking to us both.
Such was the di&s;po&s;ition of things, which I know
you love to have, as it were, brought before your
eyes, when a loud rap at the door warned us of the
approach of &s;ome vi&s;itor, Lady Sarah, always, pre|&s;ent
to her&s;elf on tho&s;e <HI>little</HI> occa&s;ions, turned her
eyes mechanically towards the candles to &s;ee how they
burnt, then on her two nieces to ob&s;erve if any
thing in their dre&s;s required to be adju&s;ted, and la&s;tly
on her&s;elf for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Mi&s;s Arnold, who
complained of having a cold, was obliged to wear a
cap under her chin, which, as it hid her fine profil,
made her appear rather to di&s;advantage. As for Ce|cilia,
I never &s;aw the little hu&s;&s;y look &s;o hand&s;ome
in my life, The &s;ervant who introduced the vi&s;itor
pronounced the name, of Mr. Falkland, and in walked
your &s;on Orlando. All the company who were not
already, &s;tanding, ro&s;e of cour&s;e. Lady Sarah ju&s;t
ca&s;t her eyes at him, and averted them immediately
with a look as one &s;hould &s;ay, Ah, is it nobody, but
<HI>you!</HI> Falkland made his bows with a good grace,
though without being well able to di&s;tingui&s;h who
and who were together, and a little aba&s;hed, I be|lieve,
at &s;eeing &s;o large a company. He advanced,
however, towards lady Sarah, Your &s;ervant, Sir,
&s;aid &s;he, turning immediately (in her forbidding way)
to &s;tir the fire, which by the bye did not want &s;tir|ring.
Servant, Mr. Falkland, cried Sir George, bow|ing
low enough; but rai&s;ing him&s;elf again with that
quick and carele&s;s motion which a man never u&s;es
but to tho&s;e with whom he is either very free, or
whom he con&s;iders as his inferiors. The &s;ervant had
placed a chair for him; Sit down, Mr. Falkland, &s;aid
Sir George, in an imperative tone, which implied,
<HI>Young man, don't keep the company &s;tanding.</HI> It was
<PB N="113" REF="115">
rather cour&s;e in Sir George, it-le&s;&s;ened Falkland, and
made him appear as if he were not worth the atten|tion
of any one pre&s;ent. He &s;eemed to feel it in this
light, for he coloured extremely; however, as he
is not a &s;tranger to good breeding, he quickly took
his place, every one re-a&s;&s;uming their's, except Ce|cilia,
who removing from her two admirers, came
and placed her&s;elf between her &s;i&s;ter and me.</P>
<P>Falkland now di&s;covered &s;everal faces that he
knew; he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;everally to lady Aud|ley,
and her daughter, to me, to the two Mi&s;s Ar|nolds,
and la&s;tly, to Sir Edward Audley. Your two
poor girls, who had reddened with joy at the &s;ight
of him, had their eyes wi&s;tfully fixed upon him from
the moment he came in; but not having had an op|portunity
of &s;peaking till he had paid his compli|ments
round, &s;eemed impatient for him to take notice
of them.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, which he had interrupted,
now appeared to flag altogether, every one &s;eemed
as if retired into them&s;elves, and poor Orlando look|ed
embarra&s;&s;ed. Sir George humm'd a tune, When
did you come from Oxford, Mr. Falkland? This
morning, Sir George. You left my &s;i&s;ter well, I
hope. Cards, cards, cried lady Sarah; and up
bounced the women with that alacrity which girls do
at the &s;crape of a &s;iddle for a country-dance. I
beckoned Falkland over to me, whil&s;t lady Sarah
was adju&s;ting the manoeuvre of her tables. He
came to me, and &s;tanding before me in a bowing
po&s;ture, each of the girls in the &s;ame in&s;tant pre|&s;ented
him her hand; he took one in each of his,
affectionately enquiring after their health. Mi&s;s Ar|nold
a&s;ked many tender que&s;tions about you. Ce|cilia
put forty to him in a breath, and without wait|ing
for an an&s;wer to the fir&s;t, proceeded to another.
I found that Falkland, though he &s;eemed not a wel|come
gue&s;t at your brothers, was not an unex|pected
one; for your daughters &s;aid they thought he
would have been in town as ye&s;terday, you having
&s;aid to that effect in your la&s;t letter.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="116">
Lady Sarah always makes her nieces play, and &s;he
now &s;ummoned them and me to our &s;everal parties.
The two &s;i&s;ters were partners, lord V&mdash;was mine,
we were all at the &s;ame table. Falkland leaned over
the back of my chair: lady Sarah had &s;lightly a&s;ked
him if he cho&s;e to play; but he declined it. I could
ob&s;erve that lord V&mdash;, as he &s;ate oppo&s;ite to him,
examined him with a mo&s;t inqui&s;itive eye; no doubt
he remembers his poor father well. I think I have
heard you &s;ay they were related, but this is not a
relation&s;hip that will be acknowledged. The &s;uit
commenced by the heirs of that unhappy gentleman,
made the proofs of this poor youth's illegitimacy too
notorious; and I have even heard lady Sarah &s;ay, that &s;he
thought it would be prudent in the young man not to
a&s;&s;ume the name of a family who would not own him.
You can't imagine, my dear Sidney, how mortified I
felt my&s;elf on account of his &s;ituation. I wi&s;h I
could &s;top here, but you had better receive the
account of what followed from, me, than perhaps an
aggravated relation from your brother.</P>
<P>I thought Dolly &s;eemed not at all well. She com|plained
her cold was heavy on her, her colour went
and came &s;everal times, and I was afraid &s;he would
have fainted. The room, &s;he &s;aid, was too warm;
You had better &s;tep out, my dear, &s;aid I, the air will
relieve you; give Mr. Falkland your cards. She did
&s;o, and Falkland took her place. Mi&s;s Audley, who
was only a looker-on, followed her out of the room.
Lady Audley, having fini&s;hed her rubber, now got
up; &s;he &s;aid &s;he was engaged ju&s;t to <HI>&s;hew</HI> her&s;elf at
Mrs. L&mdash;'s a&s;&s;embly; &s;he &s;ummoned her daughter to
attend her, and both went away. Yon mu&s;t know,
this Mrs. L&mdash;is the great rival of lady Sarah; they
contrive to have their nights, as they call them, pre|ci&s;ely
at the &s;ame time, and their great delight is to
draw away the company from each other. Three or
four more of the ladies were under the &s;ame <HI>ab&s;olute</HI>
nece&s;&s;ity with lady Audley, and lady Sarah had the
mortification to &s;ee her&s;elf de&s;erted by almo&s;t all her
female vi&s;itors; but &s;he had the comfort to reflect
<PB N="115" REF="117">
that this was not one of <HI>her</HI> nights. The company
now &s;eemed broke up, excepting our table, which
&s;till held together, and lady Sarah looked very much
out of humour. The men began to faunter about the
room, as if they did not know what to do with them|&s;elves;
when my Mr. B&mdash;, who dearly loves a game
of whi&s;t, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould make a party
among&s;t them&s;elves. Then we will leave you toge|ther,
&s;aid lady Sarah, as &s;oon as Mrs. B&mdash;is out.
We had done our game pre&s;ently after, and Mr. B&mdash;
obliging all the gentlemen to cut in, fortune allotted
lord V&mdash;to him for a partner; Sir Edward Audley
and Mr. Falkland were together, all four at the &s;ame
table. Lady Sarah whi&s;pered Mr. B&mdash;, &startq;You &s;up
with me to-night.&endq; With all <HI>my</HI> heart, &s;aid Mr.
B&mdash;; &startq;And you, my lord,&endq; in a whi&s;per to lord V&mdash;.
Thank your lady&s;hip; but I am engaged, an&s;wered
lord V&mdash;. We then left them, lady Sarah, Cecilia,
and I, retiring to Mi&s;s Arnold's chamber to enquire
how &s;he did. I have been minute about trifles; but
trifling as the&s;e preliminaries are, they led to very
&s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>We found Dolly a little feveri&s;h, and we made
her undre&s;s and go into bed. Indeed, Sidney, I am
afraid this irregular life will not do with her tender
con&s;titution; yet be not alarmed, my dear, &s;he is now
much better. I called, on her this morning, &s;he was
up, and her complaint, &s;he &s;aid, quite removed. We
&s;at chatting by her till we were told &s;upper was on
table; we went down to the parlour, and found none
there but Sir George and Mr. B&mdash;, all the other gen|tlemen
were gone. I ob&s;erved Sir George looked
extremely ruffled. I am &s;orry lord V&mdash;could not
&s;tay to &s;up with us, &s;aid lady Sarah. I would have
a&s;ked Sir Edward, but I could not get to &s;peak to
him without Mr. Falkland's hearing me, and I did
not think it nece&s;&s;ary to invite <HI>him.</HI> I am very glad
you did <HI>not</HI> a&s;k Sir Edward, &s;aid Sir George, in a
gruffer tone than I ever heard him u&s;e to lady Sarah.
Lord, why &s;o, Sir George? Becau&s;e, an&s;wered he,
he is an impertinent jackanapes, his friend Falkland
<PB N="116" REF="118">
is no better, and from this time forward my door
&s;hall be <HI>&s;hut</HI> again&s;t them both. Cecilia, added he,
your &s;i&s;ter &s;eems very fond of Mi&s;s Audley; but to
tell you the truth, I don't think either &s;he or her mo|ther
very de&s;irable acquaintances, and I &s;hould be
much better plea&s;ed if you dropped them both.
Lady Sarah is her own mi&s;tre&s;s; but, I &s;uppo&s;e, I
may have influence enough upon you two young
ladies to comply with this. Sir Edward is not a
<HI>favourite</HI> of your's niece, is he? He a&s;ked this with
a provokingly ill-natured &s;mile. Not in the lea&s;t,
Sir, an&s;wered Cecilia. Ble&s;s me, Sir George, I don't
under&s;tand you! What can be the meaning of all
this? cried lady Sarah. Well, well, Sir George,
&s;aid Mr. B&mdash;, let's have done with it; I think Sir
Edward was drunk this evening. (By the bye, I my|&s;elf
had &s;u&s;pected he was not quite &s;ober.) A plea|&s;ant
apology, an&s;wered your brother. My dear, (to
lady Sarah) I'll tell you the affair another time. The
pre&s;ence of the &s;ervants prevented lady Sarah from a&s;k|ing
any more que&s;tions; but &s;he pouted all &s;upper-time,
and poor Cecilia look'd frightened out of her wits.</P>
<P>When the cloth was removed, Sir George not re|a&s;&s;uming
the &s;ubject, and Mr. B&mdash;warding it off by
other conver&s;ation, we took our leave without hear|ing
any farther mention, made, of it; but the account
I had from Mr. B&mdash;, is this.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;ome little inadvertence had been com|mitted
by lord. V&mdash;during their play, which turned
the game at a very critical juncture, and Falkland
and Sir Edward Audley lo&s;t. It was at the very
conclu&s;ion of their play, the thing was taken no no|tice
of at the time, and lord V&mdash;went away directly;
but Mr. B&mdash;, who loves to fight his battles over
again, in talking with &s;ome triumph of his victory,
Sir Edward told him he might thank, the <HI>dexterity</HI> of
his partner for his having won; he &s;aid the word
<HI>dexterity,</HI> with an empha&s;is which implied &s;omething
more than mere &s;kill at the game, (of which, to &s;ay
the truth, lord V&mdash;has very little.) Falkland
was imprudent enough, to join him, and &s;aid
lord V&mdash;had let a card drop very <HI>oppor|tunely.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="119">
Sir George immediately took fire, and de|fended
his lord&s;hip [Mr. B&mdash;&s;ays] with unnece&s;&s;ary
warmth. Sir Edward, jealous, I &s;uppo&s;e, of lord
V&mdash;, &s;aid &s;ome tart things of him; and Falkland,
whether to take part with his friend, or nettled per|haps
at lord V&mdash;'s having taken no notice of him,
declared him&s;elf of Sir Edward's opinion. Sir George
told them they were a couple of <HI>boys;</HI> and they re|plied,
they were men enough to maintain what they
had &s;aid. Do you choo&s;e, gentlemen, that lord V&mdash;
&s;hould be informed of this? Ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, Sir
George, was the an&s;wer. Mr. B&mdash;&s;ays he interpo&s;ed
here, not thinking Sir Edward quite &s;ober, and tell|ing
your brother he was convinced that lord V&mdash;had
made an unintentional mi&s;take, (which was certainly
the ca&s;e) that the whole ought to be pa&s;&s;ed by with|out
any farther notice. The young men &s;eemed full
of re&s;entment, and Sir George &s;aid, Young gentle|men,
you had better <HI>cool</HI> your&s;elves; upon which
they &s;natched up their hats, and went away without
the ceremony of a good-night.</P>
<P>Sir George declared, after they were gone, that
though he did not think it worth while to engage
lord V&mdash;in a quarrel with them, yet he would never
let either of them into his hou&s;e again. Sir Edward,
he added, upon the &s;trength of lady Sarah's indul|gence,
has had the a&s;&s;urance to flirt with my niece;
but as I would as &s;oon give her to Satan, (that was
his expre&s;&s;ion) I am very glad of this opportunity of
being rid of him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was with Dolly this morning, Mi&s;s Audley
called to enquire how &s;he did; but &s;he was refu&s;ed
admittance; <HI>both the Mi&s;s Arnolds were gone out,</HI>
that was the an&s;wer &s;he received at the door. The
poor girls are mortified to the la&s;t degree at this
affair, as it not only robs them of an acquaintance
they like, but deprives them of the &s;ight of Falkland
too, for he lives at lady Audley's, and all communi|cation
is now cut off there.</P>
<P>You cannot think how this little event has di&s;|concerted
me; for though I am &s;ure your brother's
<PB N="118" REF="120">
friend&s;hip would be of very little con&s;equence to
Falkland, yet one would not wi&s;h a young man in
his &s;etting out in life &s;hould create to him&s;elf enemies.
You, my Sidney, who have been u&s;ed to much
rougher incidents, will not, I hope, let this affect
you.&mdash;</P>

<OPENER>Mi&s;s ARNOLD to Mi&s;s AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Pall-mall, <DATE>Jan. 4th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Wanted not this, my dear Sophy, I wanted not
this la&s;t blow to weigh down my heart already but
too much depre&s;&s;ed. Your brother has told you, I
&s;uppo&s;e, what pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t night between him and Sir
George; but he little knows how mi&s;erable the con|&s;equence
of his indi&s;cretion has made me. Oh, my
dear, I was not abroad when you call'd on me
this morning; but my uncle is &s;o full of re&s;entment
again&s;t Sir Edward, that he in&s;i&s;ts that my &s;i&s;ter and
I &s;hould break off our acquaintance with your family,
more e&s;pecially as he knows your brother has &s;ome
de&s;igns on Cecilia. How could Mr. Falkland be &s;o
thoughtle&s;s, why would he be &s;o cruel to me, as to
cut off, by his imprudence, the only hope that can
&s;u&s;tain my life, that of &s;ometimes &s;eeing him; for
might he not ea&s;ily have gue&s;&s;ed the con&s;equence of
offending my uncle Bidulph? They are the wor&s;t that
Can be conceived, he <HI>&s;huts his doors again&s;t him for
ever.</HI> Dear Mi&s;s Audley, tell. Falkland, if he has
any regard for my happine&s;s, he will endeavour to
retrieve his error, (for he certainly committed one)
by making the be&s;t apology he can to Sir George;
el&s;e think what I mu&s;t feel on our being deprived of
the fight of each other. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible I can &s;ee him
any where but either here or at your hou&s;e; at pre|&s;ent
both are interdicted by my uncle, and at the only
third place where there might be a po&s;&s;ibility of our
<PB N="119" REF="121">
meeting, I cannot take the liberty of propo&s;ing it.
This is at Mrs. B&mdash;'s; but Mr. B&mdash;was him&s;elf &s;o
much offended at the behaviour of both the gentle|men,
that I doubt whether he would permit Mr.
Falkland's vi&s;its at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I have not clo&s;ed my eyes the whole night. Cecilia
is exceedingly concerned at what has happened; but
what is <HI>her</HI> cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s to mine? I be&s;eech
you, my dear, do not let the part which Mr. Falk|land
takes in your brother's re&s;entment influence him
to refu&s;e the reque&s;t I have now made. Tell him I
conjure him to write to my uncle before it be too
late; for it is not with cu&s;toms of the world as it is
in matters of con&s;cience; and man to <HI>man,</HI> though
not to his Creator, may too late acknowledge
him&s;elf in a fault.</P>
<P>How my mama would be &s;hocked to hear of this!
I hardly know what I am writing. No one that I
dare tru&s;t with my thoughts, and <HI>you</HI> are taken from
me too! Indeed, Sophy, that is too much, indeed it
is very hard.</P>
<P>If Mr. Falkland &s;hould write me a line, let the &s;er|vant

obliged to tru&s;t her with receiving and delivering
it to me privately. Lord, to what &s;hifts am I already

own honour at &s;take upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I

<P>Here follow &s;everal letters which pa&s;&s;ed recipro|cally
between this gentleman and lady. Tho&s;e of
Mi&s;s Arnold are filled with tender complaints of Mr.
Falkland's growing indifference. In his, he defends
him&s;elf from the charge with much art and gallantry;
but little &s;hews the lover in any of them. In this
place al&s;o are &s;ome detached &s;heets of paper, wherein
Mrs. A&s;kham her&s;elf gives &s;ome particulars of the
conduct of Mr. Falkland and Sir Edward Audley
whil&s;t they were together in London, very little to
the credit of either of them, and by which it appears
that Sir Edward had but too unhappily &s;ucceeded in
debauching the morals of his companion. All this
the editor omits to avoid prolixity, excepting a little
narrative extracted from &s;ome letters written by Mr.
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Main is mentioned in the former part of the&s;e Memoirs. He was brother to Mrs. A&s;kham, and married to the daughter of Mr. Price. He was a linen-draper, and had been &s;ettled many years in London.</NOTE> Main to his &s;i&s;ter A&s;kham, which he in&s;erts as it
has a material connection with the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Main in his fir&s;t letter acquaints his &s;i&s;ter that
<PB N="122" REF="124">
a very beautiful young woman, whom he calls The|odora
Williams, having lo&s;t her parents, (people well
born) who left a numerous family of children all un|provided
for, was by her relations in the country
&s;ent to London, and recommended to Mrs. Main's
care, in order to place her either in &s;ome genteel
family, or to procure for her plain work, as &s;he was
very excellent at her needle. That Mrs. Main not
having it immediately in her power to fix her agree|ably
in the former way, had put her in a lodging near
her own hou&s;e, and con&s;i&s;tantly furni&s;hed her with
work. That having employed her to make up
&s;ome linen for Sir Edward Audley, he had accident|ally
&s;een her <HI>at their &s;hop,</HI> Mrs. Main having &s;ent for
her to take the linen home whil&s;t Sir Edward, who
had ju&s;t bought it of them, was there. In con&s;e|quence
of this unlucky interview, the young woman
in about a fortnight afterwards di&s;appeared from her
lodgings, and no one could give any account of her.
Mr. Main in this letter, which is long and circum|&s;tantial,
hints his &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of Sir Edward
Audley's being the per&s;on who had decoyed her
away, and expre&s;&s;es the utmo&s;t regret at this accident,
as the girl was the daughter of an old friend of his
for whom he had the utmo&s;t regard.</P>
<P>In his next letter, he informs his &s;i&s;ter that after a
fruitle&s;s &s;earch of nine or ten days, he had at length,
by accident, di&s;covered the place of her retreat.
That pa&s;&s;ing through a court in Bedford-&s;treet one
night, he had &s;een Sir Edward Audley go into a
hou&s;e of no reputable appearance; and judging that
this was the place where the unhappy girl was con|cealed,
he had re&s;olved, in the warmth of his hone&s;t
zeal, to go to her next morning, in order, if po&s;&s;ible,
to prevail with her to go home with him; or in ca&s;e
&s;he refu&s;ed, (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ions) to overwhelm
her with reproaches.</P>
<P>He, with difficulty, was admitted up &s;tairs to the
dining-room, where he found the poor Theodora
alone, her eyes red and &s;wollen with tears. It was
<PB N="123" REF="125">
about nine o'clock in the morning, and Sir Edward
Audley, who was then in the hou&s;e, was not yet up.</P>
<P>The young woman related to him the particulars
of her &s;tory, which I &s;hall endeavour to compre&s;s in as
narrow a compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Audley, &s;aid &s;he, after having called on
me two or three times under pretence of ha&s;tening me
with his linen, at la&s;t writ me a pa&s;&s;ionate love-let|ter,
in which he begg'd I would give him an oppor|tunity
of &s;eeing me alone the next evening, not having
had it in his power to &s;peak his &s;entiments to me, as
I always had with me a per&s;on whom I had taken in
to help me at my work. Convinced that Sir Edward
could have no warrantable de&s;igns, I &s;hewed his
letter to this woman, expre&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time,
my indignation at his reque&s;t; but &s;he only laughed
at my fears, telling me I was not the fir&s;t young per|&s;on
of ob&s;cure condition who&s;e fortune had been
made by her beauty; that I might, without any dan|ger,
hear what the gentleman had to &s;ay, and that it
would be time enough to reject his propo&s;als if I
found them di&s;hone&s;t. Seduced by the arguments of
this per&s;on, and dazzled by the appearance of Sir
Edward Audley, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be prevailed on
to grant him the interview he de&s;ired, without the
pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on. In this vi&s;it he explained
his de&s;igns at full; and after making u&s;e of all the
per&s;ua&s;ions in his power, he concluded with the offer
or a hand&s;ome &s;ettlement. I hope you will believe
me, Sir, when I tell you I rejected this offer, with
the contempt it de&s;erved; a&s;&s;uring Sir Edward I
would give directions to the people with whom I
lodged never to admit him into their hou&s;e again.</P>
<P>He retired upon this, be&s;towing high encomiums
on my virtue, and declaring he loved me more than
ever.</P>
<P>I received a letter from him the next day, in which
he told me, that finding it impo&s;&s;ible for him to live
without me, he had takes a re&s;olution to marry me;
and that, as in con&s;equence of this it was nece&s;&s;ary
he &s;hould have &s;ome farther conver&s;ation with me,
<PB N="124" REF="126">
he reque&s;ted I would once more permit him to &s;ee
me alone. I will own, Sir, my vanity was not
proof again&s;t the flattering pro&s;pects that now open|ed
before me. I &s;aw him that evening, and he re|newed
to me the &s;ame prote&s;tations that he had made
in his letter; but telling me it was of the utmo&s;t
importance to him to conceal (at lea&s;t during his
mother's life) a marriage &s;o di&s;proportionate, I mu&s;t
con&s;ent to have it performed with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy,
and in a private hou&s;e, as he would not hazard the
having it &s;olemnized in a church. I readily enough
agreed to this, de&s;iring only permi&s;&s;ion to acquaint
you and Mrs. Main with my good fortune. But this
Sir Edward po&s;itively forbid, telling me you would
not fail to acquaint his mother with the de&s;ign, which
would be the &s;ure means to overthrow it; and this
it was, Sir, which made me guilty of &s;o much ingra|titude
as to conceal the whole affair from you. I then
told Sir Edward, I would de&s;ire nothing more than
the liberty of having a friend of mine pre&s;ent as a
witne&s;s. He reproached me with my di&s;tru&s;t of
him; but a&s;ked me in whom it was that I intended to
repo&s;e this confidence. I named the per&s;on he had
&s;een two or three times with me, as the only ac|quaintance
I had in London, your family excepted
He &s;aid, people in that low condition were &s;eldom
to be tru&s;ted; but having a&s;ked &s;everal particulars
relative to her, he at la&s;t con&s;ented that &s;he &s;hould
be pre&s;ent at our marriage.</P>
<P>He then appointed as our place of meeting, this
very hou&s;e; and telling me he &s;hould have a clergy|man
ready at ten o'clock the next morning, de&s;ired
me to bring my friend with me at that hour; after
which he took his leave with all the re&s;pect due to a
woman he intended to make his wife.</P>
<P>I failed not to inform my acquaintance the &s;ame
night with this happy turn in my affairs, reque&s;ting
&s;he would be in readine&s;s the next morning to go
with me to the appointed place, where I thought my
good fortune was to be en&s;ured for life.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127">
I had agreed to call on her at her lodgings, and
you may be &s;ure, I was punctual to my time; but I
was not a little &s;urprized and mortified to find &s;he
was gone out. She had, however left a note for me
with the maid of the hou&s;e, wherein &s;he told me,
that, &startq;having been &s;ent for in a violent hurry by a
relation who was dying, &s;he had been obliged to
obey the &s;ummons; but as &s;he was certain &s;he
&s;hould not be detained long, &s;he de&s;ired me to pro|ceed
on my way, and that &s;he would in&s;allibly
meet me by the hour agreed on at the appointed
place, as it lay in her way in returning home.&endq; It
was now ten o'clock; I made no doubt but &s;he
would keep her word, and un&s;u&s;picious of any de&s;ign,
I got into a chair, and ordered my&s;elf to be carried to
this fatal hou&s;e. Sir Edward Audley met me at the
bottom of the &s;tairs, and led me directly up to the
dining-room, where I found a clergyman &s;itting in
his canonical habit. Sir Edward a&s;ked me where was
my friend? I an&s;wered him by putting her note into
his hand: I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid he, &s;he will be here pre|&s;ently.
Half an hour however pa&s;&s;ed away without
any appearance of her coming; Sir Edward grew
unea&s;y and impatient, telling me if I could have
confided in <HI>him,</HI> he would have provided a witne&s;s
who would have been more punctual. The clergy|man
now took out his watch, and &s;aying he was
under an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of going at eleven
o'clock to read prayers at the church which he &s;erved,
told us if the ceremony was retarded he could not
po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay. I looked fearfully at Sir Edward, and
ventured to a&s;k him if it would not do as well another
day? re&s;olving, if he con&s;ented to it, to take the
opportunity of going away with the clergyman.
But he replied with an oath, If it is not done now,
Madam, it <HI>never</HI> &s;hall; I cannot bear to be treated
with &s;o much di&s;tru&s;t. The clergyman then &s;aid,
that though it was more regular to have a witne&s;s,
yet as the marriage would be equally good without
one, he would make no &s;cruple of joining us, if I
would con&s;ent to it. Sir Edward &s;aid nothing; but
<PB N="126" REF="128">
walked about the room &s;eemingly very much di&s;|plea&s;ed.
What could I do, Sir, in &s;uch a &s;ituation?
I was afraid of lo&s;ing a good e&s;tabli&s;hment by being
over &s;crupulous; and depending on what the clergy|man
&s;aid, I turned to Sir Edward and told him, if the
marriage was lawful, I had no objection. In &s;hort,
Sir, we were married, and immediately after the
ceremony was over, the clergyman &s;hipp'd into the
other room, where having &s;taid a few minutes he
returned again into the dining-room for his hat,
which having ha&s;tily taken up, he went away. I
ob&s;erved that he was without his gown, and that
even the hat he took up was that of a layman. I
a&s;ked Sir Edward the meaning of this: he told me,
that to avoid ob&s;ervation he had him&s;elf de&s;ired him
to come in that die&s;s, that he had &s;ent his robes before
him, which he had, put on for decency &s;ake; but
that he had pulled them off in going away for the
&s;ame rea&s;on that he had come without them. As this
&s;eemed likely enough, it rai&s;ed no doubts in my
mind.</P>
<P>Sir Edward &s;aid, that if I approved of tho&s;e lodg|ings,
he would recommend it to me to &s;tay in them,
as he believed I could not find any others more pri|vate;
but that I mu&s;t con&s;ent to go by a different
name from that I had a right to bear, as he him&s;elf
was not known to the people of the hou&s;e by his
real name. I con&s;ented to every thing he propo&s;ed;
and though I own I did not think the&s;e lodgings hand|&s;ome
enough for <HI>his</HI> wife, I thought them full good
enough for me. He added, that he would pa&s;s as many
of his hours with me as he po&s;&s;ibly could; but tha this
mother, with whom he lived, being very old and
extremely captious, he was obliged to dedicate much
of his time to her.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward likes to lie very long in bed, he
had given orders that he &s;hould never be di&s;turbed in
a morning till he rang his bell. I ro&s;e the next
morning about eight o'clock, and leaving Sir Edward
a&s;leep, came &s;oftly into this room.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">
A maid who had been hired to wait on me, came
up &s;tairs &s;oon after, and &s;aid there was a per&s;on
below who wanted to &s;peak to Mr. Edwards, (the
name Sir Edward had a&s;&s;umed.) She &s;aid &s;he had
informed the man that &s;he dared not to di&s;turb her
ma&s;ter; but he told her his bu&s;ine&s;s was very urgent,
and he mu&s;t &s;ee him. I ventured upon this to go in
to tell him, that &s;uch a per&s;on attended to &s;peak
with him. He de&s;ired that I would order the maid
to &s;end him up, and reque&s;ted I would withdraw into
the dining-room. I did as he directed me. Sir
Edward ro&s;e immediately, and coming into the room
where I was, &s;aid his &s;ervant had brought him a
letter which he mu&s;t an&s;wer directly; he called for
pen, ink, and paper, and returned again into his
own chamber.</P>
<P>I &s;tepped down &s;tairs in the interval to give &s;ome
directions to my maid, and came up again in the
in&s;tant that the man came out of Sir Edward's room,
with the letter in his hand which his ma&s;ter had ju&s;t
written. But, Sir, what was my &s;urprize, when in
the per&s;on of this pretended &s;ervant, I &s;aw the very
clergyman who had married me the day before. His
dre&s;s indeed was different, for though he was not
in a livery, he had not on the grave cloaths that the
clergy u&s;ually wear. He bowed to me as he pa&s;&s;ed
me on the &s;tairs, but did not &s;peak. I was &s;truck at
the &s;ight, and could not tell what to make of it. I
was certain it was the very man, for I had &s;at &s;o long
in his company that I was &s;ure I could not be mi&s;ta|ken;
yet it appeared &s;o unlikely, that I thought it
be&s;t not to mention it to Sir Edward, for fear of of|fending
him by my &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>I entered the dining-room at the &s;ame time that
Sir Edward came out from the bed-chamber. He
a&s;ked me in a &s;udden manner where I had been? and
having told him, he an&s;wered, My dear, I &s;hould
wi&s;h for the pre&s;ent you would not let your&s;elf be
&s;een by &s;trangers. I replied, no-body had &s;een me
but his &s;ervant. Did he &s;peak to you? &s;aid he,
(with &s;ome confu&s;ion in his looks.) I an&s;wered, he
<PB N="128" REF="130">
had not. 'Tis a wonder, &s;aid Sir Edward, for he is
a forward fellow, and as I have been obliged to tru&s;t
him, I concluded he might be di&s;po&s;ed to let you &s;ee
he was in our &s;ecrets. He kept his eyes fixed on me
while he &s;poke; I made no reply; and he pre&s;ently
after went out, telling me he had bu&s;ine&s;s which he
was afraid would detain him the whole day, but that
he would be with me early in the evening.</P>
<P>When I found my&s;elf alone, I could not get the
thoughts of this clergyman out of my head. The
more I con&s;idered, the more I was convinced that he
and Sir Edward's man were one and the &s;ame per&s;on;
but I thought it much more probable that he &s;hould
have impo&s;ed his &s;ervant on me for a par&s;on, than
that he &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e the vi&s;it of this clergyman to
him under colour of his being his &s;ervant. Yet what
could I do? I had no witne&s;s to my marriage, and I
thought it in vain to &s;peak of it.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the day very unquietly. About ten o'clock
Sir Edward came in, and, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment,
another young gentleman with him, whom he &s;aid he
had brought to &s;up with me. He introduced him
to me by the name of Falkland; but did not intro|duce
me to him, nor call me otherwi&s;e than by my
chri&s;tian name all the evening. I was &s;adly out of
countenance and vexed; for I thought Mr. Falkland,
though a good-humoured and civil young gentleman,
behaved to me with le&s;s re&s;pect than was due to Sir
Edward's wife, if he had believed me to be &s;uch.
The two gentlemen were in high &s;pirits, and as they
&s;eemed inclined to &s;it to their bottle, I thought it
proper to retire, and went into my own room.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce time to &s;hut the door after me, when I
heard Sir Edward a&s;k his companion how he liked me?
You may be &s;ure, Sir, I had the curio&s;ity to li&s;ten
to his an&s;wer, and putting my ear clo&s;e to the door,
I heard Mr. Falkland &s;ay, &startq;She is very pretty, and
looks very innocent too; I &s;hould not take her to
be one of that &s;tamp.&endq; What do you mean by
<HI>&s;tamp?</HI> &s;aid Sir Edward. I'd have you to know &s;he
is as mode&s;t a girl as any in England. Mr. Falkland
<PB N="129" REF="131">
laughed, and an&s;wered, I &s;uppo&s;e you have taken
the poor girl in by the old bait, a promi&s;e of mar|riage?
Sir Edward made &s;ome reply, which I could
not hear, and they quickly changed the di&s;cour&s;e;
but as my curio&s;ity was &s;o rouzed by what I had al|ready
heard, that it took away from me all inclina|tion
to &s;leep, &s;o I could not leave the &s;pot where I
&s;tood, in expectation of di&s;covering from their di&s;|cour&s;e
&s;omething farther of my own mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion;
for it was very plain to me that Sir Edward
had pa&s;&s;ed me on this gentleman for his kept mi&s;tre&s;s.
I could learn however, nothing more than that Sir
Edward and his friend were very loo&s;e men.</P>
<P>I went to bed in great affliction, con&s;idering my|&s;elf,
tho' very innocent in my intention, as living in an
unlawful &s;tate. Sir Edward ob&s;erved my melan|choly
next morning, and with his u&s;ual kindne&s;s a&s;k'd
me the rea&s;on of it. I told him that I &s;u&s;pected the
man whom I had &s;een the day before wad the very
per&s;on who had married us. Who, my man David?
&s;aid Sir Edward, laughing: By my &s;oul, child, he
can make as good a marriage as e'er a par&s;on in
Europe&mdash;I interrupted him, Oh, Sir, if you have
had the barbarity to u&s;e me thus after all your pro|mi&s;es!
He took me up &s;hort, and &s;till in merriment,
If you <HI>fancy</HI> your&s;elf, married, &s;aid he, your virtue
is as &s;afe as if an archbi&s;hop had joined us: all tho&s;e
things are in the imagination; but don't turn <HI>wife,</HI>
my dear Dora, by beginning to grumble. Con&s;ider
we are in our honey-moon, He then patted me on
the cheek, and bidding me good bye, ran down
&s;tairs.</P>
<P>I won't trouble you, Sir, with my &s;orrowful re|flections;
I &s;hall only &s;ay that I was now convinced
that I was undone; and had great rea&s;on to believe
that Sir Edward, as &s;oon as he grew weary of me,
would abandon me, and that it was not in my power
to redre&s;s my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of my unea&s;ine&s;s, my acquaintance,
who had &s;o &s;hamefully broke her promi&s;e to me,
came in to &s;ee me. She made &s;ome excu&s;es for it
<PB N="130" REF="132">
not worth repeating. Then looking about her, &s;mil|ing,
Indeed, Mi&s;s Williams, &s;aid &s;he, I am very glad
to &s;ee you &s;o well &s;ettled. I hope Sir Edward's love
may la&s;t; but at wor&s;t, to be &s;ure, he will take care
to provide hand&s;omely for you. I was provoked,
and almo&s;t confounded to hear her talk in this man|ner.
I have not forgot my&s;elf, &s;aid I, nor do I want
to take the airs of a lady upon me; but I &s;hould be
glad you would remember that I am Sir Edward
Audley's wife. She bur&s;t out a laughing, You don't
want to per&s;uade me to that &s;ure? &s;aid &s;he. Not
per&s;uade you! an&s;wered I; why, what rea&s;on have
you to doubt it? Lord, child, &s;aid &s;he, I only thought
you wanted a hand&s;ome excu&s;e for putting your&s;elf
into Sir Edward's hands, when you told me he in|tended
to marry you; for do you fancy any gentle|man
would bring his wife into &s;uch a place as <HI>this?</HI>
I know nothing of the place, an&s;wered I; but 'tis
very certain we were married here the day before
ye&s;terday. Be it &s;o, &s;aid &s;he, (with a &s;neer, as if &s;he
did not credit what I &s;aid); I am glad, however, I
was out of the &s;crape. I was &s;o &s;hocked at this wo|man's
behaviour, that I knew not what to &s;ay. I told
her, as I found &s;he was determined either not to be|lieve,
or <HI>pretend</HI> not to believe me, that her company
was far from being agreeable to me. She &s;aid, if I
was grown &s;o proud, &s;ince I had changed my lodg|ings,
&s;he knew as well as I how to keep her di&s;tance;
and adding, &s;he was &s;orry that &s;he had given her&s;elf
the trouble to call on me, &s;he walked down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with vexation and &s;hame.
I concluded immediately that this vile woman had
been tampered with by Sir Edward. I recollected
how particularly he had enquired about her when I
fir&s;t mentioned her to him: and as &s;he was in low cir|cum&s;tances,
I made no doubt but he had given her
$word$ to act in the wicked manner &s;he had done;
knowing very well, to be &s;ure, that though the mar|riage
ceremony had been performed by his own
&s;ervant, yet (I being ignorant of the cheat) had a
witne&s;s been pre&s;ent, it would have been lawful;
<PB N="131" REF="133">
for I remember to have heard of &s;uch a thing hap|pening
in my own neighbourhood in the country.</P>
<P>You may judge, Sir, how mi&s;erably I &s;pent the re&s;t
of the day. I &s;aw not Sir Edward till the next night.
He came in about nine o'clock, and was very much
fuddled, but as he was in a good humour, I thought
I could get the truth out of him. I a&s;ked him, &s;mil|ing,
as we fat together, whether it was really his man
David who had married us? Why, ay, &s;aid he;
and I'll an&s;wer for it, you never were better married
in your life: that's a very clever fellow, let me tell
you. I believe, it, Sir, &s;aid I; but &s;till I am afraid
the marriage won't hold. It will hold as long as any
other marriage would with <HI>me,</HI> &s;aid he; that is as
long as I &s;hall like my wife.</P>
<P>$word$ was not in a condition to be talked to &s;eriou&s;ly
at that time, therfore I forbore &s;aying any thing far|ther
on the &s;ubject; but when I would have renewed
it next morning, he either really had or pretended to
have forgotten what had pa&s;&s;ed the night before. He
endeavoured to laugh me out of my apprehen&s;ions;
but without giving me any a&s;&s;urances that they were
ill founded. In &s;hort, he told me at la&s;t, that he
&s;hould always expect to pa&s;s tho&s;e hours agreeably
that he &s;pent with me, otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t not hope for
much of his company. I was afraid to urge him
$word$ what re&s;ource had I? I had thrown my&s;elf
fro$ a under the protection of my only friends, and
kn$w not whither to go. I &s;aw too well that
Sir Edward did not con&s;ider me as his wife: yet I
was &s;en&s;ible I did not de&s;erve a wor&s;e name. I have
pa&s;&s;ed every day &s;ince in the &s;ame unquiet &s;tate; Sir
$span$ my &s;cruples into ridicule. I pre&s;&s;ed
hi$ $$$terday, if he really meant me fair, that, in
$span$ my mind ea&s;y, he would con&s;ent that
$span$ married over again$ in pre&s;ence of a
witne$s, even of that &s;ervant who I $ound was al|ready
in our $$cret. He re$ented the propo&s;al $word$
and told me, I had taken a very wrong way
to &s;ecure his affections. I cried almo&s;t the whole
<PB N="132" REF="134">
night; for I am determined rather to &s;ubmit to the
lowe&s;t &s;tation, than to live with him upon tho&s;e
terms.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is my unfortunate &s;tory; and though I
dreaded of all things to &s;ee either you or Mrs. Main,
yet I am now rejoiced at our meeting, that you may
advi&s;e me what to do.</P>
<P>I told the poor creature (proceeds Mr. Main] that
I was afraid her ca&s;e was without remedy; for that
if Sir Edward was re&s;olved not to acknowledge her
as his wife, I did not &s;ee how it was in her power to
oblige him to do it; for that having no witne&s;s, the
man who performed the marriage ceremony, would
undoubtedly, if he was (as &s;he believed) the &s;ervant
of Sir Edward, deny the matter as well as his ma&s;ter.
I &s;hall, however, &s;aid I, &s;peak to him before I leave
the hou&s;e: and after I have heard what he has to &s;ay,
&s;hall be the better enabled to advi&s;e you. She &s;eemed
terrified at the thoughts of what might re&s;ult from
my que&s;tioning Sir Edward; but I bid her not make
her&s;elf unea&s;y, telling her, that in a ju&s;t cau&s;e I was
not afraid of any man living.</P>
<P>Sir Edward ro&s;e &s;oon after, and entered the dining-room
with the utmo&s;t carele&s;sne&s;s, little expecting
to find any one there but the poor deluded girl. He
&s;topped &s;hort, when he &s;aw me, and reddened up to
his eyes. Your humble &s;ervant, Sir Edward. Have
you any bu&s;ine&s;s with me, Mr. Main? Sir, I &s;hould
be glad you would permit me to &s;peak a few words
to you. You know where I live, Sir; what is the
rea&s;on that you come to &s;eek me here? I did not ex|pect
to find you here, Sir Edward; my bu&s;ine&s;s was
with this poor young gentlewoman. But &s;ince I
<HI>have</HI> met with you&mdash;He interrupted me, turning
peevi&s;hly to the poor girl, who hung down her head,
I &s;uppo&s;e madam, &s;aid he, 'tis you who have &s;ent for
your friend Main? I thought I had warned you
&s;ufficiently on that head. Sir Edward, &s;he did not
&s;end for me, an&s;wered I; but as &s;he was put by her
friends under mine and my wife's care, I thought it
my duty to &s;earch her out&mdash;Well, Sir, now you
<PB N="133" REF="135">
have found her, what then? Sir Edward, you mu&s;t
pardon me for a&s;king you a free que&s;tion; Is this
young woman your wife? for &s;he tells me, &s;he is
married to you. Prithee, hone&s;t Main, &s;aid he, do|not
a&s;k impertinent que&s;tions; for you may take it
for granted I &s;hall not an&s;wer one of them. This la|dy
is my property; and I don't don't know that you
have any thing to do either with her or me. Sir Ed|ward,
I don't pretend to have any thing to do with
<HI>you;</HI> but I think my&s;elf accountable for the actions
of a young per&s;on who&s;e conduct I was de&s;ired to
watch over. The girl is di&s;contented with her &s;itua|tion,
If &s;he be <HI>not</HI> your wife, and is willing to leave
you, I think the laws both of God and man will
authorize me to take her from infamy. On the other
hand, if &s;he <HI>be</HI> married to you, though I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
that, as well for yours as your family's
&s;ake, I would have prevented it, had it been in my
power; yet as that is now too late, I will give you
my oath, if you require it, to keep your &s;ecret, pro|vided
you will let me &s;ee the clergyman who married
you, and permit me to get a certificate from him of
his having done &s;o. I told you before, &s;aid he, that
I would an&s;wer none of your que&s;tions; and as for
your part, madam, &s;ince you have been &s;o imprudent
as to betray your own intere&s;ts, I &s;hall give you no
farther &s;atisfaction on the &s;ubject; only I &s;hall take
care to remove you to a place where it will not be
in your power to expo&s;e either your&s;elf or me. By
what authority, Sir Edward, will you remove her?
By my own, Sir; &s;he belongs to me. Mrs. Dora,
&s;aid I, are you Sir Edward's wife? We were married,
an&s;wered the poor thing, the tears running down her
face. You hear what &s;he &s;ays, Sir Edward? Why,
what the deuce would you <HI>have</HI> her &s;ay? an&s;wered
he. Ay, but, Sir Edward, what do <HI>you</HI> &s;ay? No|thing,
Sir, I <HI>will</HI> &s;ay nothing; but take her from
me at your peril! Sir, if &s;he be your wife, you will
have the laws on your &s;ide; but as &s;he looks upon
it only to have been a mock marriage, performed by
your own &s;ervant, and in all likelihood, the intended
<PB N="134" REF="136">
witne&s;s &s;uborned to be out of the way, &s;he does not
con&s;ider you as having any authority to detain her;
therefore, if &s;he is willing to go with me, I think
my&s;elf bound to receive and protect her.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed confounded at what I &s;aid; and I be|lieve
the firm manner in which I &s;poke, convinced
him that I was neither to be trifled with nor fright|ened.</P>
<P>You know very well, an&s;wered he, that I am un|der
&s;uch re&s;traints with regard to my family, that I
cannot do my&s;elf public ju&s;tice in an affair of this
kind; otherwi&s;e you would not dare to behave thus.
But a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, if you attempt, either by con|trivance
or force, to take this girl from me, I &s;hal
treat you as I would a robber. I hope, Sir Edward,
&s;aid I, you have more honour than to a&s;&s;ault an
unarmed man, who is under the &s;helter of your roof;
I, therefore, am not, at pre&s;ent, alarmed at your
threats. As for what may happen hereafter, I &s;hall
only &s;ay, that I will always defend my&s;elf again&s;t
violence; but as I do not think my&s;elf obliged to
fight, you may depend upon it, Sir Edward, I &s;hall
have recour&s;e to a legal reparation for any injury
you may attempt again&s;t me; and I mu&s;t take the
liberty to tell you, that I look upon this young wo|man
as under <HI>my</HI> protection, not <HI>yours,</HI> unle&s;s you
convince me that &s;he is your wife, which, I again
repeat to you, that I will keep &s;ecret. He &s;wore a
great oath, and a&s;ked me what rea&s;on I had to doubt
her being &s;o. Her own account, an&s;wered I; &s;he be|lieves
her&s;elf deceived, and I own I am of the &s;ame
opinion. She is a fool, and you are another, an&s;wered
he. Sir Edward, you &s;hall not provoke me by u&s;ing
hard names, Do you in&s;i&s;t, madam, (turning to the
young woman) upon the proof which I have required
of Sir Edward? or are you &s;atisfied to live with him
without it? She took courage at &s;eeing me &s;o re&s;o|lute
in her defence. I will not live with him with|out
it, an&s;wered &s;he; and if he refu&s;es it, I &s;hall
look upon it as di&s;owning me. I &s;hould be as un|willing
as you, Sir, added &s;he, applying her&s;elf to
<PB N="135" REF="137">
Sir Edward, to draw on you the re&s;entment of your
friends; nor have I any de&s;ire of being known for
your wife, till you &s;hall think proper to acknowledge
me; but I will not be pa&s;&s;ed upon your acquaintance
for a kept woman; for &s;uch, I am &s;ure, Mr. Falk|land
thinks me. If we were lawfully married, it can|not
hurt you to put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a proof of it;
and, in that ca&s;e, I am ready to retire wherever you
&s;hall command me, and &s;hall willingly, if you de&s;ire
it, hide my&s;elf from every body but your&s;elf. As
for Mr. Main, as I have already told him every cir|cum&s;tance
that has pa&s;&s;ed, he may as well be tru&s;ted
with the proof of our marriage as my&s;elf; more e&s;pe|cially
as he has offered you his oath, if you require
it, to keep the &s;ecret as long as it &s;hall be thought
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit with which the girl made this fair pro|po&s;al,
put Sir Edward with his back to the wall; he
affected an air of indifference, and, &s;winging him|&s;elf
back and forward in his chair, Upon my &s;oul,
madam, I did not think yon had been &s;o knowing in
the ways of the world. I thought I had got an in|experienced
girl; but I find&mdash;She interrupted him
bri&s;kly, Sir, you have got an hone&s;t girl, and, if the
expre&s;&s;ion became me, I would &s;ay, a girl of honour&mdash;
Mighty fine, ma'am! were you ever play'd any trick
before? or is this your fir&s;t adventure? The poor girl
bur&s;t into tears. 'Tis unmanly in you, Sir, to add in&s;ults
to deceit. By Jupiter, &s;aid he, I believe the girl has
been on the &s;tage! that is &s;o theatrically pretty!
But come, Mr. Main, added he, ri&s;ing, I mu&s;t de&s;ire
the favour of you to walk down &s;tairs. I will offer
you no violence; only I advi&s;e you, as a friend, to
go home quietly, and mind your &s;hop; otherwi&s;e
without doing you the lea&s;t injury, I will &s;hew you
the way to the &s;treet-door.</P>
<P>The poor girl now clung to my arm, and declared
&s;he would go with me, as &s;he was determined not to
&s;tay another night under the &s;ame roof with Sir Ed|ward.
He pulled her roughly from me, calling her
an ungrateful little fool, who would &s;acrifice both
<PB N="136" REF="138">
her duty and her intere&s;t to a ridiculous whim. I
was about to make him a reply, when we heard &s;ome
one tap at the dining-room door, and, without wait|ing
to be an&s;wered, Mr Falkland walked into the
room. He &s;eemed &s;urprized at &s;eeing me there; but
without &s;aying any more than civilly a&s;king me how
I did, he de&s;ired to &s;peak with Sir Edward in the
next room. They both retired. I heard Sir Edward
(who you know, &s;peaks loud and vehemently) &s;wear
two or three oaths, and, by an imperfect bit of a
&s;entence that now and then reached our ears, it &s;eemed
as if Mr. Falkland had come to warn him of &s;ome
danger; and I judged it to be that of an impatient
and very urgent creditor; for I heard Sir Edward
&s;ay, I wrote the &s;coundrel word ye&s;terday of my
difficulties, though he is &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;hed for nothing more than to bring to a
conclu&s;ion, with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, the un|lucky
affair in which I was engaged, I intended wait|ing
till Mr. Falkland &s;hould be gone, in order to re|ceive,
if it was po&s;&s;ible, Sir Edward Audley's final
determination with regard to the unfortunate girl;
but &s;he, who had her thoughts only bent upon quit|ting
him, took it into her head that this would be a
fair opportunity of doing &s;o, as it would &s;ave me
from any farther indignity, and her&s;elf from the ter|rors
of any thing that might en&s;ue, in ca&s;e he &s;hould
forcibly oppo&s;e her going away. She propo&s;ed mak|ing
her e&s;cape directly, with an eagerne&s;s which
&s;hewed how much her heart was &s;et upon it. For
my part, I thought it the be&s;t cour&s;e we could take;
and therefore, without he&s;itating, I took her under
the arm, and, ju&s;t as &s;he was, without either hood
or cloak, I led her &s;oftly down &s;tairs, out at the
&s;treet-door, and, ha&s;tening our &s;teps, we were in a
minute out of the court. I popped her into a hack|ney-coach,
on the &s;tand in Bedford-&s;treet, and, get|ting
in after her, we drove directly to my hou&s;e;
where having told my wife, in few words, her un|happy
&s;tory, &s;he received her very cordially.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
This is the &s;ub&s;tance of Mr. Main's &s;econd letter
to Mrs. A&s;kham. And in a third (dated a few days
after) he tells her, that his wife and he, not thinking
it advi&s;eable that the young gentlewoman &s;hould
continue in London, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould fall a &s;econd time
into the hands of Sir Edward Audley, they had im|mediately
come to a re&s;olution to &s;end her out of
town, an opportunity ju&s;t then very luckily offer|ing.
A lady, who was their cu&s;tomer, and who
u&s;ed to lodge at their hou&s;e whenever &s;he came to
London, which was but very rarely, had, a few
days before, written to Mrs. Main, to reque&s;t &s;he
would look out for a genteel &s;ervant for her to wait
upon her&s;elf. It was to this lady, therefore, they
determined to &s;end her; but before &s;he went, they
thought it proper that &s;he &s;hould write a few lines to
Sir Edward Audley; which &s;he did, in the following
words, Mrs. Main having dictated them to her.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;AS I &s;hould be as unwilling to be &s;u&s;pected of in|fidelity,
or even levity, as I &s;hould be to be guilty of
a breach of duty, I think my&s;elf bound to declare,
in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that no other motive has
induced me to take the &s;tep I have done, but a belief
next to conviction that you have deceived me, and
that I cannot live with you, without con&s;idering my|&s;elf
in a &s;tate of infamy. Your conduct to Mr. Main,
as it has left me no room to doubt of my misfortune,
&s;o it has almo&s;t deprived me of hope; for your love,
Sir, if you &s;hould &s;till have any for me, can never be
of any value to me, &s;o long as you think me unwor|thy
of your e&s;teem. I was highly &s;en&s;ible of the ho|nour
you did me, in conde&s;cending to make me your
wife: had you thought me worthy of the title, I
&s;hould have endeavoured, by my gratitude and hu|mility,
to have in time, perhaps, appeared not unde|&s;erving
of it.</P>
<P>By the time this letter comes to your hands I &s;hall
be out of your reach; but if you &s;hould ever wi&s;h to
<PB N="138" REF="140">
recal from poverty, grief, and &s;hame, the poor
wretch, who but for you would have lived contented
in the former, and perhaps had never known the
latter, my friend Mr. Main will know where to find
me. I &s;hall only beg the favour of you, Sir, to give
orders that the few things I left behind me at the
lodgings may be &s;ent to that gentleman's hou&s;e. You
will know, without my &s;igning a name, which I dare
not a&s;&s;ume, from whom this comes.&endq;</P>
<P>Though my wife (continues Mr. Main) thought it
advi&s;eable to tell Sir Edward that the poor girl would
be out of his reach before he &s;hould receive her let|ter,
&s;he yet judged it nece&s;&s;ary to keep her in
town till &s;he &s;hould recover her cloaths, as &s;he had
nothing in the world but what &s;he had then on her.
We &s;ent the letter to lady Audley's hou&s;e, and the
&s;ame night all the young woman's cloaths were
brought to mine by a porter; but no me&s;&s;age from
Sir Edward. Concluding from thence that he meant
the affair &s;hould drop quietly, and &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility
of the unhappy girl's being able to do her&s;elf ju&s;tice;
I thought &s;he had no part to take but to retire into
the country as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The following day I received a vi&s;it from Mr.
Falkland. I am come to you, Mr. Main, &s;aid he,
from Sir Edward Audley, who has received a very
extraordinary letter from the young per&s;on whom you
took the other day from her lodgings. She talks in
that letter of a marriage, and accu&s;es Sir Edward of
having betrayed her. I will not pretend to ju&s;tify him
for having &s;educed a girl to quit an hone&s;t livelihood
in order to live with him upon an improper footing;
but I am to a&s;&s;ure you from him, that the &s;tory of a
marriage ceremony having been performed, is all an
invention of her's, contrived to &s;ave her credit with
you and Mrs. Main, after you had di&s;covered where
&s;he was.</P>
<P>My wife, interrupted Mr. Falkland here; Sir, &s;aid
&s;he, I &s;hould be very unwilling to believe that you
are any way privy to Sir Edward's wicked de&s;igns;
on the contrary, I am inclined to think that, he has
really impo&s;ed on you, as he would now endeavour
<PB N="139" REF="141">
to do on us; but pray, Mr. Falkland, let me a&s;k
you, if this poor young creature had voluntarily
con&s;ented to live with Sir Edward as a mi&s;tre&s;s,
what &s;hould induce her to quit him &s;o &s;uddenly?
for &s;he complains of no ill treatment from him. So
far otherwi&s;e, &s;he acknowledges he was very fond
of her; and had &s;he meant nothing more than to have
&s;aved her credit with us, &s;he needed only to have
told Mr. Main &s;he was married, and that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to keep the affair &s;ecret. Sir Edward, I
dare &s;ay, would not have &s;crupled to have confirmed
this, if his bare a&s;&s;ertion would have been taken
without any farther proof; and in that ca&s;e, it would
not have been Mr. Main's bu&s;ine&s;s to have interpo&s;ed
any farther.</P>
<P>My good Madam, &s;aid Mr. Falkland, (who&s;e
words you know are as &s;mooth as oil) what you &s;ay
is very true, and it was the very que&s;tion I my&s;elf
put to Sir Edward when he &s;hewed me the young
per&s;on's letter, and reque&s;ted I would come to you
to explain matters; but Sir Edward's an&s;wer to me
was, that in the warmth of his pur&s;uit of this girl,
he had made her &s;ome promi&s;es of marriage. I
reproached him for this; but Sir Edward, you know,
is a very gay man, and too much devoted to his
plea&s;ures; he only laughed at me, &s;aid he had made
the &s;ame promi&s;es twenty times before, and that &s;he
was the fir&s;t who had ever claimed the performance
of them. That it was a thing of cour&s;e, and meant
no more than to give a girl a pretence for yielding to
her own inclinations with a better grace, and that
he thought the per&s;on in que&s;tion had experience
enough to know how far men were to be tru&s;ted on
tho&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Main lifted up her hands and eyes at this,
Mr. Falkland inveighed again&s;t the profligacy of the
pre&s;ent times, and &s;aid he was very &s;orry his intimate
connections with Sir Edward Audley (which it was
not in his power to break) had led him to the know|ledge
of &s;o much of it. He then proceeded to tell us
that the girl, in con&s;equence of Sir Edward's fooli&s;h
<PB N="140" REF="142">
prote&s;tations, had pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly to marry her;
that he had endeavoured at fir&s;t only to evade her
in&s;tances, and thought in a little time &s;he would
have dropt them; but as he now found her an artful
creature who had con&s;ented to an union with him
only from motives of intere&s;t, and that &s;he had vanity
enough to &s;uppo&s;e he would come into any terms
rather than part with her, he was determined not to
give him&s;elf any farther trouble about her: but that
&s;he might not reproach him with having lo&s;t her time
to no purpo&s;e, he had &s;ent her fifty guineas: Which
Mr. Falkland at the &s;ame time pre&s;enting to me in a
pur&s;e, begg'd I would take the trouble of remitting
to her where-ever &s;he was, and that the affair might
not be mentioned any more, as he was &s;ure it would
give lady Audley great unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Falkland I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from
taking a &s;um of money which I was certain the young
gentlewoman her&s;elf would reject with &s;corn. That
as I &s;aw &s;he had nothing to expect from Sir Edward's
ju&s;tice, &s;he &s;hould not be obliged to his charity.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland put up the pur&s;e again into his
pocket, &s;aying he had no more to do in the affair;
but added, he hoped out prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of
the young per&s;on, would not lead us to believe every
thing &s;he &s;aid to the prejudice of a gentleman, who,
though wild and extravagant, was not capable, he
was &s;ure, of &s;o ba&s;e an action as that with which &s;he
charged him. He then took his leave, telling us he
was &s;orry, very &s;orry on our account for what had
happened, and again begged that it might not be
mentioned at Woodberry, le&s;t by that means it
&s;hould come round to lady Audley's ears; for which

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;to Mrs. ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 1&s;t.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;o &s;o vexed, my dear Sidney, I hardly know
how to collect my thoughts, and &s;till le&s;s to
arrange my words in &s;uch a manner as to convey
tho&s;e thoughts to you, without giving you more
pain than, I hope, the occa&s;ion demands; but to
&s;ay the wor&s;t at once, matters are in a very di&s;a|greeable
&s;ituation at your brother's.&mdash;Sir George, I
am afraid, carries the authority with which you have
inve&s;ted him too far. He urges Cecilia without
cea&s;ing, to accept of lord V&mdash;. Lady Sarah is violent
in her in&s;tances; my lord him&s;elf is extremely a&s;&s;i|duous
in his court&s;hip. Mi&s;s Arnold, influenced by
her uncle, tenderly pre&s;&s;es her &s;i&s;ter to make lord
V&mdash;happy, and to oblige all her friends. Mr. B&mdash;and
I, at your's as well as Sir George's reque&s;t, have
joined our entreaties, but all to no purpo&s;e. Cecilia
remains inflexible, and has begg'd her uncle's per|mi&s;&s;ion
to return to Oxford&s;hire; which he has re|fu&s;ed,
unle&s;s <HI>you</HI> &s;hould ab&s;olutely <HI>command</HI> her re|turn,
which, to u&s;e his own words, &startq;he &s;uppo&s;es
you will have a little more prudence than to do.&endq;
I own I am at a lo&s;s to account for this unconquer|able
ob&s;tinacy in a young creature bred up as your
<PB N="142" REF="144">
daughter has been. Sidney, I am afraid there is
&s;ome prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the ca&s;e, of which you are
ignorant. Perhaps Sir Edward Audley,&mdash;yet I do
not think 'tis he either; &s;he a&s;&s;ured Sir George in
my pre&s;ence, with an indifference that carried not
the lea&s;t mark of affectation in it, that &s;he had not
for him the &s;malle&s;t attachment. She had two other
lovers, both agreeable men, who knows&mdash;</P>
<P>I am interrupted; Mi&s;s Cecilia Arnold, the &s;ervant
tells me, is in the drawing-room. She is without
her &s;i&s;ter; an odd vi&s;it enough, my dear, for you
mu&s;t know this is a good Sunday morning on which
I am &s;cribbling to you, and it is now church-time;
but I am not yet well enough to go out. I go to
attend your daughter; you &s;hall know the re&s;ult of
our conference.</P>
<P>An odd vi&s;it I &s;aid it was, before I had &s;een
Cecilia; I now think it much more &s;o. I found her
alone, her pretty little face full of embarra&s;&s;ment.
She made an apology for coming at &s;o improper an
hour; but &s;aid it was the only time which &s;he could
command. Lady Sarah, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>now</HI> never &s;uffers
me to &s;tir abroad without her, except to church;
as her lady&s;hip &s;eldom ri&s;es early enough for the
morning &s;ervice. And I omitted attending that duty
to-day in order to get the opportunity of &s;peaking
to you alone, as I concluded your indi&s;po&s;ition &s;till
confined you. Indeed, madam, I am made exceed|ingly
unea&s;y, they drive me to extremes, I am quite
mi&s;erable, I can't bear it; and I am come to be&s;eech
you, madam, to write to my mama, and to beg of
her to recall me home. You know my uncle de|clared
he would not &s;uffer me to return without my
mama de&s;ired it; I am &s;ure &s;he will do any thing
that you &s;hall recommend to her. Do, dear madam,
(pre&s;&s;ing eagerly my hand) conjure my mama to &s;end
for me.</P>
<P>She &s;poke &s;o rapidly, and with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s,
that I could not interrupt her before; but now
a&s;&s;uming a very grave countenance, You know,
Mi&s;s Cecilia, &s;aid I, that there is nothing I would not
<PB N="143" REF="145">
do to promote your real intere&s;ts; but you will
pardon me, if I tell you that I do not think the &s;tep
you would have me take could in any wi&s;e contribute
to them; neither do I imagine that it would be at all
becoming in me to interfere in the manner you would
have me. I have already taken my party; Sir George
and lady Sarah have both made u&s;e of the influence
they &s;uppo&s;ed I had over you, in order to induce
you to yield to the de&s;ires of all your family. I <HI>have</HI>
u&s;ed my be&s;t endeavours, and though they have
not &s;ucceeded, I cannot think of giving up the intere&s;ts
of all tho&s;e who have a right to your obedience,
in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t you to avoid their importunities.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed aba&s;hed at my rebuke, and after a &s;hort
&s;ilence was about to reply, when we were inter|rupted
by the &s;udden appearance of a very unex|pected
vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Your &s;on, Falkland, was &s;hewn into the room
where we were &s;itting. Cecilia &s;tarted at his entrance
&mdash;I ab&s;olutely <HI>&s;tared,</HI> for I was a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing
him. He made his compliments to me with polite|ne&s;s,
though with a certain degree of even &s;omething
more than <HI>ea&s;e,</HI> which convinced me he had mixed
much with the gay world &s;ince his arrival in London.
He a&s;ked pardon for the liberty he had taken in ju&s;t
&s;tepping in as he pa&s;&s;ed by, which he acknowledged
he had been induced to do from &s;eeing Sir George
Bidulph's chariot at the door; and concluding that
one or both of the Mi&s;s Arnolds were with me, (for
he knew that neither lady Sarah nor Sir George made
&s;uch early vi&s;its) he relied on my goodne&s;s to forgive
his impatience to a&s;k his &s;i&s;ters how they did, as he
was denied the means of &s;eeing them any where el&s;e;
he added, with an air both of &s;incerity and re&s;pect,
that exclu&s;ive of any other motive than the plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing <HI>me,</HI> he &s;hould long &s;ince have done him&s;elf
that honour, if he had not thought his vi&s;it would
have been unacceptable to one &s;o much the friend of
lord V&mdash;and Sir George Bidulph as was Mr. B&mdash;.
He reddened as he &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t words, which
&s;hewed me the re&s;entment he &s;till had in his heart
<PB N="144" REF="146">
again&s;t them both. As I knew Mr. B&mdash;'s mind on
the occa&s;ion, I could make no other reply than a
civil compliment at large, which was by no means
an encouragement to his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Sidney, this boy has an infinity of addre&s;s, and
&s;omething &s;o captivating in his manner, that however
mal apropos his company appeared at this juncture, I
could not help being plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>Mr. B&mdash;was not at home; and to &s;ay the truth, I
was not &s;orry for the interruption, as I did not chu&s;e
to be pre&s;&s;ed any farther on the &s;ubject of Cecilia's
vi&s;it to me, and I imagined that after the repul&s;e I
had already given her, &s;he would not be &s;ond of
renewing the conver&s;ation; but I was mi&s;taken, &s;he
was too full of it to let it drop &s;o ea&s;ily. After a few
&s;pecches had pa&s;&s;ed between Falkland and me, he
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Cecilia, and a&s;ked her coldly,
<HI>When am I to wi&s;h you joy, Madam?</HI> Cecilia an&s;wer|ed
with quickne&s;s, &startq;When you &s;ee me delivered
from per&s;ecution, if ever that will be.&endq; Per&s;ecu|tion!
repeated Falkland. Yes, replied your daugh|ter,
all my friends have combined to make me un|happy;
they would force me to marry lord V&mdash;, I
<HI>never</HI> will. And &s;he pronounced the word <HI>never</HI>
with a mo&s;t deci&s;ive energy.</P>
<P>You wrong your friends, my dear, &s;aid I, when
you accu&s;e them of u&s;ing force; they have hitherto
only endeavoured to per&s;uade, and, I dare &s;ay, never
mean to carry their authority farther. She &s;hook
her head, Ah, Madam, you don't know what <HI>&s;ort</HI> of
per&s;uaders my uncle and aunt are. Their reque&s;ts
are commands, and their per&s;ua&s;ions are threats, and
I dread even downright violence from their authority.
If I were at home, I am &s;ure I could depend upon
the tenderne&s;s of the be&s;t of mothers. She knows
not what I &s;uffer.</P>
<P>She could &s;ay no more, and &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t
into tears.</P>
<P>Why do you not write to your mama, &s;aid Falkland,
and entreat her permi&s;&s;ion to return to Woodberry?
It was in order to prevail on Mrs. B&mdash;to do this for
<PB N="145" REF="147">
me, an&s;wered Cecilia, that I have waited on her
to-day, And will you, Madam? cried Falkland,
bri&s;kly. I an&s;wered him pretty much in the &s;ame
terms I had before done your daughter; then added,
And now, Mr. Falkland, let me appeal to your own
good &s;en&s;e (all little prejudices apart that you may
have conceived again&s;t lord V&mdash;) is he not in every
re&s;pect a de&s;irable match for Mi&s;s Cecilia, and one
to which &s;he cannot have any rea&s;onable objection?
I then enumerated all the per&s;onal merits, and every
other advantage which lord V&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ired
he would give me his opinion freely. I believe every
thing you &s;ay of him to be true, Madam, was his
an&s;wer. Ought he then to be rejected, Mr. Falk|land?
Cecilia's <HI>heart</HI> alone can an&s;wer that que&s;tion,
Madam. Cecilia was &s;ilent, and &s;eemed as if in
expectation of hearing what we &s;hould &s;ay farther on
the &s;ubject. I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, my lord V&mdash;had made
Mi&s;s Arnold his choice in&s;tead of her &s;i&s;ter. I wi&s;h
&s;o too, interrupted Falkland. If he had, continued
I, I am inclined to think we &s;hould have met with
le&s;s oppo&s;ition. Cecilia pre&s;ently catched my words;
I wi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;i&s;ter were married to lord V&mdash;,
and then we might <HI>all</HI> be happy. Does Mi&s;s Arnold
like him? demanded Falkland. No, replied Cecilia;
but I believe &s;he likes no one el&s;e. The&s;e words
apparently &s;lipped from her; &s;he blu&s;hed extremely
after &s;he had &s;poken them, as if con&s;cious of what
they implied. Perhaps, my dear, that is not <HI>your</HI>
ca&s;e, &s;aid I; &s;he &s;miled in endeavouring to turn it
off; Dear Mrs. B&mdash;, can't a young woman <HI>di&s;like</HI>
one man withour <HI>liking</HI> another? Very po&s;&s;ibly,
Cecilia; but how do you know that Mi&s;s Arnold's
heart is in &s;uch a &s;tate of indifference as you &s;ay it
is? She never dropp'd to me the lea&s;t hint to the
contrary. That may be, but <HI>&s;i&s;ters</HI> do not always
make confidents of each other. That's <HI>very</HI> true,
&s;aid &s;he, and &s;eemed collected in her&s;elf, and as it
were lo&s;t in thought for a minute. Falkland, who
had remained &s;ilent all this while, now a&s;ked Cecilia
what &s;he purpo&s;ed to do? &s;aying it was a mi&s;erable
<PB N="146" REF="148">
&s;ituation to be daily expo&s;ed to the addre&s;&s;es of an
unacceptable lover; and at the &s;ame time to the
importunate &s;ollicitations of perhaps <HI>indelicate</HI> rela|tions.
Since Mrs. B&mdash;, an&s;wered Cecilia, does not
think it prudent to intercede for me, I will write to
my mama my&s;elf to implore her protection; if &s;he
will receive me, I &s;hall be very happy to remain as I
am; if not&mdash;She &s;topp'd her&s;elf &s;hort. What
then, my Cecilia? &s;aid Falkland. God knows what
will become of me, &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing bri&s;kly from her
chair; but indeed I never will be the wife of lord
V&mdash;. She then bid me good-morning, and Falkland
taking his leave at the &s;ame time, he handed her
down &s;tairs, when, having put her into her chariot,
I ob&s;erved from my window that he talked with her
for &s;ome time, leaning on the door of it, after which
he ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and &s;he drove away.</P>
<P>I am utterly at a lo&s;s, my dear Sidney, what ad|vice
to give you, becau&s;e I am really quite bewilder|ed
in my conjectures. If Cecilia's heart <HI>be</HI> pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
'tis a &s;ecret that &s;he has guarded with the
utmo&s;t caution, &s;ince even her &s;i&s;ter is ignorant of it.
But what if it &s;hould turn our that the affection which
you encouraged between them and Falkland in their
childhood, &s;hould with regard to this poor young
creature have &s;tepped beyond the bounds which your
maternal care would have pre&s;cribed? My dear,
there is nothing improbable in this; yet if it be &s;o,
I am certain that Falkland is as much a &s;tranger to it
as the re&s;t of the world. The manner in which he
a&s;ked her the que&s;tion with relation to her marriage
with lord V&mdash;, convinced me he looked upon that
match as on a thing which was likely to take place.</P>
<P>If the ca&s;e &s;tands thus, I &s;hould think it would be
better never to que&s;tion Cecilia on the &s;ubject.
When we extort from another a &s;ecret which we
&s;hould be very unwilling to learn, and which perhaps
but for our own importunity we never &s;hould have
known; it, in my opinion, in &s;ome degree binds up
our hands, and prevents us from acting, in con&s;e|quence
of this acknowledgment, with that freedom
<PB N="147" REF="149">
which we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have a right to do, whil&s;t
acting under an apparent ignorance of the per&s;on's
&s;ecret wi&s;hes. On the contrary, if your daughter
&s;hould have courage enough voluntarily to di&s;clo&s;e
her mind to you, &s;he lays you under no obligation of
&s;hewing the lea&s;t indulgence in favour of a ra&s;h and
imprudent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; nor ought it to wound ei|ther
your delicacy, or your tenderne&s;s to exert your|&s;elf
in doing your utmo&s;t to turn her from it. I have
ju&s;t here thrown out to you my &s;entiments at large
upon the &s;ubject, though perhaps I might have &s;pared
them, as po&s;&s;ibly my &s;urmi&s;es (for they are nothing
more) may be without foundation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I do not <HI>recommend</HI> it to you to
recall your daughter home; yet I cannot help be|lieving
that it is more in <HI>your</HI> power than in that of
any other per&s;on to bend her little wayward heart
to that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which her friends require. By all
that I have been able to ob&s;erve of Cecilia's temper,
it is not one that will patiently &s;ubmit to controul.
You, my dear, have never had the opportunity of
making any experiments of this kind. You who are
meekne&s;s it&s;elf have always tempered your autho|rity
with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, that your children, I
believe, never once in their lives had the &s;malle&s;t
merit in their obedience. Is it not natural then to
expect that a young girl full of vivacity, of a high
&s;pirit, and not <HI>uncon&s;cious</HI> of her own worth, brought
up with uncommon indulgence, &s;hould revolt again&s;t
any act of violence done to her inclinations? more
e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who&s;e authority &s;he cannot hold
as &s;acred as that of a mother's. I am not to inform
you that Sir George is rather apt to overdo every
thing, and that he would exert as much force to re|move
a feather, as to lift an anchor. As for poor
lady Sarah, as &s;he never had the happy knack of
conciliating any one's affections to her, &s;o were &s;he
even mi&s;tre&s;s of a larger &s;tock of prudence than Hea|ven
has favoured her with, &s;he could not expect to
have any great influence. Cecilia has extreme good
&s;en&s;e, and as much good nature; but &s;he has a <HI>will,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="150">
Sidney, a will which mu&s;t be gently led, and not &s;u|riou&s;ly
driven; and I am &s;atisfied &s;he would do more
to &s;pare you an hour's unea&s;ine&s;s, than &s;he would to
purcha&s;e a crown for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you will receive a pre&s;&s;ing letter from
her, in order to obtain her recal to Woodberry. I
have been minute in laying before you every circum|&s;tance
that I could gather, and have given my
thoughts to you freely upon the whole, that you
may be the better able to form your own conclu|&s;ions.
If you judge it proper to &s;end for her, re|member
you have mea&s;ures to ob&s;erve with Sir
George Bidulph, and that it will be incumbent on
you to convince him by your conduct, that you took
this &s;tep, in order by your own immediate influence
to promote the general wi&s;hes of the family, rather
than to gratify Cecilia in the indulgence of (I cannot
help, my dear, calling it) her perver&s;ene&s;s.&mdash;</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>Feb. 6th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot expre&s;s to you, dear brother, how ex|tremely
mortified I am at Cecilia's childi&s;h ill|judged
ob&s;tinacy. I was in hopes my lord V&mdash;'s
merit, joined to the duty &s;he owes to the will of her
parents, would by this time have determined her in
his favour; but I find I am di&s;appointed in my ex|pectations,
and deceived in the opinion I had too
partially entertained of my daughter's di&s;cretion. I
have received a letter from her in which &s;he has
entreated my permi&s;&s;ion to return into Oxford&s;hire.
I know not whether 'tis with your knowledge &s;he
has written it, nor indeed whether it will be prudent
in me to yield to a reque&s;t, which whim rather than
<PB N="149" REF="151">
judgment &s;eems to dictate. If you don't di&s;approve
of it, however, I &s;hould be plea&s;ed that &s;he were &s;ent
home. Do not imagine, brother, I mean this as an
indulgence to her caprice; &s;o far from it, I have no
other motive to urge my compliance than a belief
that it may be in my power to bow her mind more
effectually by &s;uch means as I can u&s;e when &s;he is
with me, than by all the arguments to which I could
have recour&s;e by letter, and which I have already
vainly applied. There are a thou&s;and little avenues
to the heart which are &s;hut up, and almo&s;t imper|ceptible
to every one but tho&s;e who have traced them
from infancy. I think Cecilia loves me, and could
not bear to be a witne&s;s to that unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he
her&s;elf cau&s;ed to &s;o affectionate a mother.</P>
<P>If my lord V&mdash;is not already tired with the pur|&s;uit,
my doors &s;hall be always open to receive him,
and he may depend on having in me a warm and
&s;incere advocate. A little time may work a favour|able
change; and Cecilia, who, I am &s;orry to &s;ay,
has di&s;covered on this occa&s;ion more wilfulne&s;s than
I thought was in her nature) may perhaps, when le&s;s
urged, open her eyes voluntarily to her own intere&s;t
and happine&s;s, as well as that of her friends.</P>
<P>As for my daughter Dolly, I flatter my&s;elf her
behaviour will continue to be &s;uch as will give lady
Sarah and you rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her. I have
no pain with regard to that dear child but on account
of her health; &s;he complains not; but I have my
fears, yet I check them, as I am &s;ure &s;he is in the
hands of very tender relations. I hope lady Sarah
will continue her friendly care of her &s;o long as it
will be convenient to her to retain my daughter in
London.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next week (if nothing intervenes which may
give me cau&s;e to change my de&s;ign) &s;end my chariot
for Cecilia. Mrs. A&s;kham is &s;o kind as to promi&s;e
we will go to town for her, in order to bear her
company clown. Be &s;o good as to tell my daughter
this, as I do not mean to an&s;wer her letter. Mean

<P>AS you expected that I &s;hould &s;et out on my
return to Woodberry with Mi&s;s Cecilia as on
to-morrow, and will no doubt be &s;urprized at my
delay, I mu&s;t beg leave to tell you that I fear I &s;hall
be detained in town a few days longer; but I am
&s;ure you will excu&s;e me when you know the rea&s;on,
which is, that my &s;i&s;ter Main has ju&s;t lo&s;t her fa|vourite
child; and as &s;he expects every hour to lie|in,
my brother has begg'd of me earne&s;tly not to
leave her in her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. As I could not
refu&s;e this reque&s;t, I hope I &s;hall have your per|mi&s;&s;ion

<P>I drove directly to Sir George's on my arrival in
town ye&s;terday, and having &s;ent in my name, was
a&s;ked up &s;tairs to lady Sarah's dre&s;&s;ing-room. It
was about two o'clock. I found her lady&s;hip at her
toilet; Mi&s;s Arnold was at work by her, and Sir
George was reading a news-paper. He to&s;&s;ed it
down when I came in, and I thought looked a little
coldly at me; he ro&s;e, however, and bowed to me
very civilly. My lady, who &s;aw me as &s;he &s;at oppo|&s;ite
the looking-gla&s;s, a&s;ked me how I did, though
without turning her head about; my dear Mi&s;s
Arnold ran and embraced me. (I know, Madam,
you like I &s;hould be particular). I &s;uppofe, Madam,
&s;aid Sir George, Mrs. Arnold has &s;ent you for her
<HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>obedient</HI> daughter; he laid a great &s;tre&s;s
<PB N="151" REF="153">
upon tho&s;e two la&s;t words. I am come for Mi&s;s
Cecilia, Sir, &s;aid I, if &s;he has your's and my lady's
permi&s;&s;ion to return. Lady Sarah only &s;aid Umph!
in her &s;cornful manner, though &s;till without taking
her eyes off the gla&s;s. I am &s;orry, &s;aid Sir George,
that I ever had any thing to do with her, &s;he has
vexed me heartily; but it &s;hall be the better for <HI>you,</HI>
Dolly. Is Mi&s;s at home, Sir? &s;aid I. You may
&s;uppo&s;e, an&s;wered lady Sarah, that we &s;hould hardly
&s;uffer a young lady &s;o wilful as &s;he is, to have the
liberty of going abroad without &s;ome of us with
her; for my part I would not take the charge of
her, for there is really no knowing&mdash;She
&s;topped there; I was very much concerned, on hear|ing
that Mi&s;s Cecilia was in the hou&s;e, not to find
her in company with her &s;i&s;ter and the re&s;t of the
family, and was afraid they did not admit her into
their pre&s;ence. May I be allowed to &s;ee her,
Madam? &s;aid I; for as I have directions to carry
her out of town to-morrow, I believe Mi&s;s would
like to be apprized of it as long before as po&s;&s;ible.
Oh, an&s;wered Sir George, for that matter you may
a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf &s;he is in readine&s;s; however, if you
chu&s;e it, Mrs. A&s;kham, you may go up &s;tairs to
her; I fancy you will find her in her own chamber.
Be &s;ure now don't be <HI>&s;evere</HI> on the poor child, nor
repeat any of the <HI>har&s;h</HI> things her <HI>mother</HI> &s;ays on
this occa&s;ion. Sir George &s;poke this in his biting,
ironical way; but I would not &s;eem to under&s;tand
him; and ri&s;ing up, I believe, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;he will
find her mama very angry with her; though I &s;hall
not take the liberty of &s;aying any thing on the
&s;ubject. Mi&s;s Arnold ro&s;e at the &s;ame time, with a
de&s;ign, I believe, of &s;hewing me to her &s;i&s;ter's cham|ber;
but Sir George &s;topped her, Where now,
Dolly? &s;aid he; Mrs. A&s;kham and your &s;i&s;ter may
have &s;ecrets; pray, my dear, don't interrupt them.
Mi&s;s Arnold &s;at down again immediately; Upon my
life, &s;aid Sir George, if you were not the be&s;t girl in
the world, that little vixen would be enough to &s;poil
<PB N="152" REF="154">
you. At the &s;ame time he bid my lady's woman
wait on me to Mi&s;s Cecilia's chamber.</P>
<P>I found the dear creature by her&s;elf, very bu&s;y in
packing up &s;ome of her little nicer things in band|boxes
for the expected journey. She &s;prung to me
the moment I entered the room, and throwing her
arms round my neck, after having enquired about her
mama's health and that of Mr. Price, When are we
to go out of town? &s;aid &s;he. To-morrow, my dear,
an&s;wered I, (for as I had not at that time called on
my brother, I knew not that I &s;hould be delayed).
Thank God! thank God! an&s;wered &s;he, I hope my
mama is not <HI>very</HI> much di&s;plea&s;ed with me? My dear
Madam, you can't &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is much &s;atisfied with
your behaviour; but I am not commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;ay
any thing on this head from her. I had rather you
<HI>were,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, and that my mama had &s;ent me
a great &s;colding by you, for I dread the mild correc|tion
of <HI>her</HI> eye more than all my uncle's violence,
and lady Sarah's ill-nature. I wi&s;e, continued &s;he,
poor Dolly were going out of town along with me;
for I am &s;ure &s;he as little likes &s;taying here as I do,
only &s;he has not &s;pirit enough to &s;ay &s;o. I hope, my
dear, &s;aid I, you won't put it into her head to de&s;ire
it, for that would be making an entire breach be|tween
your mama and Sir George! By no means,
an&s;wered &s;he, &s;miling; he intends to make my &s;i&s;ter
his heir, if &s;he does not di&s;oblige him as I have done.
I would not for the world interpo&s;e; but be&s;ides, it
is not in my power, for do you know that for this
week pa&s;t they won't let my &s;i&s;ter conver&s;e with me,
for fear, as my uncle &s;ays, of my perverting her?
Ble&s;s me, Mi&s;s Cecilia, cried I, is it po&s;&s;ible that
things have gone &s;o far? Oh yes, &s;aid &s;he, you &s;ee I
am grown a &s;ad girl &s;ince I left Oxford&s;hire, and all
this becau&s;e I won't marry a man I don't like! As I
re&s;olved not to enter on that topic with her, I replied,
But how can you be deprived of your &s;i&s;ter's conver|&s;ation;
I thought you had &s;lept together? No, an|&s;wered
&s;he, we always have had &s;eparate apartments
here as well as at home; but we u&s;ed, notwith&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="153" REF="155">
to have our hours for little private chat; but
now, we never &s;peak but in the pre&s;ence of my uncle
and aunt, which confines our conver&s;ation to meal
time; for I take as little of their company as I can,
and my poor &s;i&s;ter is always pinn'd to lady Sarah's
&s;leeve: 'Tis a dreadful life, added &s;he, &s;ighing; do
they think to bend my mind to their purpo&s;e by &s;uch
&s;everity? No, no, Mrs. A&s;kham, my heart revolts
again&s;t &s;uch tyranny; yet I am glad they have made
u&s;e of it, becau&s;e&mdash;Becau&s;e what, my dear? Becau&s;e
I &s;hall return with double &s;atisfaction to a
parent from who&s;e tenderne&s;s I have every thing to
hope.</P>
<P>I made no reply to Mi&s;s Cicilia; but here, will
you forgive me, my ever re&s;pected and deare&s;t ma|dam,
if I take the liberty to &s;ay that I am afraid our
young lady's reliance on the mildne&s;s of your di&s;po&s;i|tion,
has encouraged her to &s;tand out &s;o po&s;itively
again&s;t the will or her friends. Perhaps, Madam, if
you were a little le&s;s indulgent, Mi&s;s might be more
tractable. She likes not to be controuled; and, I
can't help &s;aying, that I believe Sir George has been
rather too &s;trict with her. She flies from him to
you; po&s;&s;ibly if your countenance were to be a little
changed towards her, &s;he would fly from you to lord
V&mdash;, who &s;he knows idolizes her, and who to be
&s;ure would be a noble and happy match for her.
Excu&s;e me, Madam, for thus hinting my thoughts;
but as you have &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to a&s;k my
opinion, and even to take my advice, I hope you
will pardon me.</P>
<P>I did not think it proper to &s;tay any longer with
Mi&s;s; but telling her I &s;hould be ready to attend her
the next day, I went down &s;tairs again to know at
what hour Sir George &s;hould think it convenient for
me to call for her. He told me, at what hour I
plea&s;ed. I &s;aid, At eight o'clock in the morning;
Sir George replied carele&s;ly, With all my heart.
Poor Mi&s;s. Arnold looked wi&s;tfully at me, as if &s;he
were de&s;irous that I &s;hould not go away &s;o &s;oon; for
I had not &s;ate down when I returned again into lady
<PB N="154" REF="156">
Sarah's room. Sir George ob&s;erved it; Come, &s;aid
he, to Mi&s;s, I know you long to have a little con|ver&s;ation
with your old friend: lady Sarah, do you
dine at home? You will excu&s;e my ob&s;ervation here,
Madam; but I thought Sir George gave this hint to
my lady, in order to put her in mind of a&s;king me to
dinner, though he would not venture him&s;elf to in|vite
a per&s;on whom my lady remembered to have been
his &s;i&s;ter's &s;ervant; but I &s;hall always be proud of
the title, and &s;o I &s;hould be, even if I had not owed
to you, Madam, the pro&s;perity I now enjoy. My
lady replied, Yes &s;ure, Sir George, we bave company
you know. Mi&s;s Arnold then took courage to &s;ay,
Mrs. A&s;kham, can you oblige me with your company,
this afternoon? for I have &s;carce had time to enquire
after my mama, and I &s;hould be glad to a&s;k after all
our neighbours in the country. I hardly knew what
an&s;wer to make; for though I wi&s;hed as much as my
dear Mi&s;s to &s;ee her again, yet I did not know whe|ther
my vi&s;it would be agreeable to lady. Sarah; but
before I had time to reply, her lady&s;hip &s;aid, Do
come if you can, Mrs. A&s;kham, I am &s;ure my niece
will be glad to &s;ee you. I told Mi&s;s Arnold I would
wait on her, and took my leave.</P>
<P>Having found my brother's family in the di&s;tre&s;s
I have already mentioned, I thought it &s;till more nece&s;|&s;ary
to go, in order to tell Mi&s;s Cecilia that her jour|ney
mu&s;t be deferred for a day or two; accordingly
about five o'clock I went to Sir George's; I enquired
for Mi&s;s Arnold; the &s;ervant &s;aid &s;he had not yet left
the parlour where they dined; but that Mi&s;s Cecilia
was gone up to her own chamber; and if I plea&s;ed
he would call her to me. I de&s;ired he would do &s;o;
and &s;he pre&s;ently flew down to me. I am &s;orry, &s;aid I,
Madam, to &s;ee you ab&s;ent your&s;elf thus from your
friends, e&s;pecially as you are &s;o &s;oon to leave them. I
do not like to be brow-beaten, replied &s;he; formerly
every thing I &s;aid and did was admired; but times
are &s;adly altered with poor Cecilia; be&s;ides, I do not
like the company they have with them, they are for|mal
<PB N="155" REF="157">
old people, and I was glad to &s;lip away. I have
received a letter to-day from my lord V&mdash;, added &s;he,
all in the &s;ome breath, a very decen$ one it is; the
man &s;eems to have &s;ome &s;en&s;e and &s;ome delicacy; I
hate him for it, becau&s;e it will make me appear the
more inexcu&s;able. I wi&s;h I could like him, but&mdash;
I am a perver&s;e &s;ool, and there's an end on't. She
then gave me the letter to read, telling me at the &s;ame
time that my lord V&mdash;had not been to vi&s;it Sir George
for two or three days pa&s;t, which her uncle and aunt
laying to her account, had teized her to death on the
occa&s;ion. After I had read the letter, having told
Mi&s;s that I could not po&s;&s;ibly leave town the next
day, (at which &s;he &s;eemed &s;adly vexed) I informed
her I &s;hould write to you, to let you know the cau&s;e
of our delay, and that I &s;hould be very glad if &s;he
would allow me to inclo&s;e to you, my lord's letter.
Dear Mrs. A&s;kham, &s;aid &s;he, how can you de&s;ire &s;uch
a thing? I have not &s;hewn it to a mortal but your&s;elf,
and would not have my mama &s;ee it for the world. I
&s;hould appear &s;o giddy, &s;o ob&s;tinate, &s;o unaccounta|ble!
I am &s;orry then, Madam, &s;aid I, that you have
&s;hewn it to me, for I &s;hall certainly think it my duty
to acquaint your mama with every thing I know con|cerning
you, therefore you may as well let her have
the letter, for I &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly give her the contents of
it. Well, put it in your pocket then, &s;aid &s;he, with
&s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure in her looks, and don't let any one
h$e &s;ee it; for we ju&s;t then heard Mi&s;s Arnold at the
door, who, having enquired if I was come, ran to
receive me. She a&s;ked me over and over again after
her dear mama, then enquired for all her friends in the
country, one by one, and demanded when you had
heard from Mr. Falkland, whom &s;he &s;aid &s;he had not
&s;een &s;ince the night that &s;ome little di&s;pute had hap|pened
between him and Sir George. Both the ladies
expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves much concerned at this affair,
and &s;aid they hoped it had not given you any ill im|pre&s;&s;ion
of Mr. Falkland, as you knew Sir George had
never been well inclined towards him.</P>
<P>I think poor Mi&s;s Arnold does not look very well;
<PB N="156" REF="158">
&s;he is rather thinner than &s;he was, and her &s;pirits &s;eem
but low, which I attribute chiefly to the thoughts of
parting with her &s;i&s;ter. I hope, however, Mrs. B&mdash;'s
fears for her health have le&s;s grounds than &s;he appre|hends;
for Mi&s;s her&s;elf &s;ays that if &s;he were to return
to the country to her former quiet life, &s;he is &s;ure &s;he
&s;hould be perfectly well. I believe &s;o too, yet as I
am certain your recalling her would highly di&s;oblige
Sir George, with whom &s;he is a very great favourite,
I believe, Madam, you will think it advi&s;eable to
let her &s;tay in town at lea&s;t till the latter end of
&s;pring.</P>
<P>I here inclo&s;e my lord V&mdash;'s letter, which as I
thought it would be acceptable, I would not defer
the &s;hewing it to you till Mi&s;s Cecilia's return, though
I am in hopes that will not be retarded above a day
or two.</P>

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, <DATE>Feb. 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Do not give the name of an apology to the rea|&s;ons
I am going to offer for having taken the re|&s;olution
of ab&s;enting my&s;elf from you. An excu&s;e
implies, at lea&s;t, a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> offence; but where there
is an utter indifference on one &s;ide, a&s;&s;iduity or inat|tention
on the other, mu&s;t pa&s;s equally unregarded
and unob&s;erved, and an apology mu&s;t con&s;equently
appear impertinent. Yet, madam, if in your di&s;en|gaged
moments you &s;hould ca&s;ually be&s;tow a thought
on me, I mu&s;t be&s;eech you not to imagine that I can
either re&s;ent or blame your coldne&s;s towards me,
or that I can ever cea&s;e to admire and re&s;pect you;
and while I lament my misfortune in not having been
able to gain your affection, I would fain flatter my|&s;elf
that this has not proceeded &s;o much from aver|&s;ion,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
as from a &s;entiment of delicacy. Con&s;cious beau|ty
and worth are ever tenacious of their own privi|leges,
and &s;hould not be approached by the ordinary
avenues. I ought to have con&s;idered that as my hap|pine&s;s
depended only on you, I &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have
tried to obtain an a&s;&s;urance from your&s;elf, that your
heart was not intirely aver&s;e to me, before I ven|tured
to expo&s;e you to the &s;olicitations of your friends
in my favour. I acknowledge my error, madam, and
a&s;k your pardon for it; yet it was an error into
which I was led by the partiality, of Sir George
Bidulph and my lady V&mdash;, who gave birth to
my &s;ecret wi&s;hes almo&s;t as &s;oon as I had conceived
them, and flattered me with certainty before I dur&s;t
flatter my&s;elf with hope. But though I have been
&s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for my pre&s;umption, I think I
owe you a reparation for the trouble. I have given
you. I am highly bound to Sir George for the zeal
with which he has endeavoured to &s;erve me; but as
I cannot bear to &s;ee you, for whom I would &s;acrifice
my life, made unea&s;y, I know of no way to rid you of
the importunity of your friends on my account, than
that of remitting my unacceptable addre&s;&s;es. Yet
do not think, madam, I am &s;o temperate a lover as in|tirely
to yield up all preten&s;ions to your favour: if
your heart is not already engaged, I will di&s;pute it
with any future pretender; but I will owe it to no
one but your&s;elf. Sir George Bidulph mentioned to
me a de&s;ign you had of returning into the country:
if it be to avoid me, madam, let me conjure you not
to deprive your friends of the plea&s;ure they enjoy in
your &s;ociety, nor your&s;elf of any &s;atisfaction you can
receive in theirs. My happine&s;s is too immaterial to
be put in the balance with yours; and I promi&s;e you,
whatever it may co&s;t me, that I will not enter Sir
George Bidulph's hou&s;e whil&s;t you continue there,
unle&s;s I have expre&s;sly your permi&s;&s;ion to do &s;o; and
with regard to Sir George him&s;elf, as good-breeding
mu&s;t oblige me to excu&s;e this part of my conduct to|wards
him, I &s;hall do it in &s;uch a manner as not to
leave you open to the &s;lighte&s;t reproach. Time and
your own genero&s;ity, madam, are the only advocates
<PB N="158" REF="160">
on which I &s;hall henceforth rely; if Mrs. Arnold
would be &s;o good as to &s;econd their operations, I
&s;hould not de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. I know her character
too well to fear your &s;uffering any thing from the ri|gour
of authority; and &s;hould my heart impel
me to carry my vows down to Oxford&s;hire, tho' I
&s;hould &s;till be wretched enough to have them rejected,

<P>I Have &s;een your letter to my daughter; though
I mu&s;t tell you hone&s;tly I am not indebted to her
candor for this participation. She &s;hewed it but to
one &s;ingle per&s;on, who in&s;i&s;ted upon communicating
the contents to me, and accordingly &s;ent it to me.</P>
<P>I thank you, my lord, for the frankne&s;s as well as
the tenderne&s;s of your behaviour to a girl, who, I
am afraid, is too thoughtle&s;s to be &s;en&s;ible of your va|lue.
I expect my daughter home every hour, as, at

reflection &s;hall have brought her to a due &s;en&s;e of

<P>DOLLY, my dear Dolly, do not be angry with
your &s;i&s;ter for leaving you. Angry, did I &s;ay?
No, that I am &s;ure, you cannot be I never &s;aw your
face clouded with a frown &s;ince I was born; let me
then rather beg of you not to be grieved at my ab&s;ence.
Indeed, my dear, if I could have &s;upported the ve|ry
unea&s;y life I led in town, I would, for your &s;ake,
have endeavoured to have &s;ubmitted to it. But you
know it was impo&s;&s;ible; be&s;ieged daily by the impor|tunities
of a man whom I could not bring my&s;elf to
like, at the &s;ame time that I was con&s;cious of his
worth; urged to a painful degree by the friends I &s;o
much re&s;pect; and reproached with ingratitude and
di&s;obedience, at the time when my heart was filled with
acknowledgment and duty. My dear, it is a mi&s;era|ble
&s;ituation for a girl, who is not a fool, to have no|thing
but <HI>will</HI> to oppo&s;e to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and that was the
&s;ituation of your poor &s;i&s;ter; for now he is out of
my &s;ight, I am ready to allow that my lord V&mdash;de&s;erves
a much better wife than Cecilia: I would, to heaven
he had one to morrow a thou&s;and times richer, hand|&s;omer,
wi&s;er, better: and now, I think, I am out of
his debt; for he never wi&s;hed me any hu&s;band but
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Well, but now I mu&s;t tell you, that though I am
rejoiced to find my&s;elf at home, I am very far from
<PB N="160" REF="162">
being as happy as I u&s;ed to be. My mama, Oh, &s;i&s;ter,
my mama is intirely in my lord V&mdash;'s intere&s;ts,
and condemns me exceedingly; Mr. Price does the
&s;ame: good old man! I love him, though he chides
me from morning to night. Mis. A&s;kham, who is
of the cabinet council here, has taken up the &s;ame
tone, and I am to&s;&s;ed like a &s;huttle-cock from one to
t'other; but then they do not give me &s;uch hard
blows as my uncle and lady Sarah u&s;ed to do; be&s;ides
I have longer rece&s;&s;es; for I make frequent e&s;capes
into the garden, and tho' the weather is not very in|viting,
the gravel-path in the wood is always dry.&mdash;
Ah, Dolly, I would &s;ain tell you &s;omething; but the
time is not yet arrived, perhaps it may&mdash;Yet, if I

hate to be confined in my writing; therefore,
if you have a mind to give my rambling imagination
full play (which, for your own entertainment, you
ought to de&s;ire) you mu&s;t allow me to direct to you
under cover to Mr. Main, who&s;e &s;crupulous exactne&s;s
I pre&s;ume, will not object to the conveying a letter
privately from one &s;i&s;ter to another; for if my uncle
is to in&s;pect all my letters, you will never get any thing
more from me than four &s;tiff-lines written in my be&s;t
hand, &s;uch as &s;choolma&s;ters receive once a year from
the children they teach to write; in which they beg
pardon for pa&s;t faults, and promi&s;e amendment for
the time to come.</P>
<P>I have begun by &s;ending this to Main, with a
charge to give it into your own hands; and this &s;ame
po&s;t brings a fine flouri&s;hing letter of thanks to lady
Sarah for all civilities to me. I had as lief have let
it alone, but my mama in&s;i&s;ted on it; and to &s;ay the
truth, lady Sarah was kind enough to me at fir&s;t,
and, I believe, would have continued &s;o, if lord
V&mdash;had not unluckily thru&s;t in his no&s;e to di&s;turb
our union. Do you know that my mama has written
to him, and hinted that &s;he would be glad to &s;ee him
here? 'Tis very true, I a&s;&s;ure you; &s;he &s;hewed me a
<PB N="161" REF="163">
copy of her letter. If he &s;hould come down, let
them beware of driving me to extremities.&mdash;From
whom do I inherit this &s;tubborn &s;pirit of mine? I do
not remember my papa, but I have often heard he was
a mild-tempered man; and for my mother, has &s;he
not been a prodigy of &s;uffering patience! Ah, Dolly,
why am not <HI>I</HI> more like her?&mdash;Adieu, dear, dear

<P>&mdash;Lady Sarah received your letter in good
part, as you know &s;he loves to have civil things &s;aid
to her; but my uncle called you a little hypocrite.</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;was here the other day; he told us
he had been indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;ome days pa&s;t, which
prevented our &s;eeing him. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
much concerned for having been the occa&s;ion of
driving you from town; blamed him&s;elf for having
been too precipitate in urging his &s;uit, till a longer
proof of his affection had a little better intitled him
to &s;ollicit your favour. He &s;aid he had received a
very obliging letter from my mama, which had given
him new life, as &s;he had a&s;&s;ured him in it of her
warme&s;t concurrence in promoting his wi&s;hes; he
added, that with this encouragement he purpo&s;ed
renewing his attack in Oxford&s;hire; but that he
would fir&s;t give Mi&s;s Cecilia time to recover her&s;elf
from the fatigue &s;he had undergone in town from his
importunities. My uncle &s;eems much plea&s;ed with
this &s;tep of my mama's; for I believe he was afraid,
my lord would intirely have given up. the pur&s;uit.
He &s;aid, (&s;peaking of you) after his lord&s;hip was
gone, That girl is the verie&s;t little tyrant in nature;
&s;he has different ways of &s;ubjecting every one. to her
<PB N="162" REF="164">
will; &s;he awes lord V&mdash;with her faecy looks,
and &s;ubdues her mother with her &s;ly care&s;&s;es. <HI>I</HI> am
the only per&s;on who can deal with her. My &s;i&s;ter
<HI>pretends,</HI> added he, to be angry with her; but we
&s;hall &s;ee whether &s;he has re&s;olution enough to exert
a proper authority on this occa&s;ion; for I am deter|mined
to be at Woodberry at the &s;ame time that my
lord V&mdash;is there, or I am &s;ure his journey will
be to very little purpo&s;e. How I tremble for you,
my poor Cecilia! Yet indeed, my dear, I think my
lord V&mdash;worthy of you, if you were even more
amiable than you are. He is an admirable man; he
has every thing in his favour; every heart loves
him, but that perver&s;e one for which he &s;ighs; but
perhaps my Cecilia has not one to be&s;tow on him.
Ah, my dear, there is a &s;ecret locked up in that
little clo&s;e bo&s;om of yours, that you would fain let
out; give it vent, my love; I promi&s;e you to keep
it inviolably, if you require it of me. If you have
given your affections to a de&s;erving object, I. pray hea|ven
you may meet with a return: for would it not be
a dreadful thing to love without being, beloved again?
yet &s;till more dreadful to lo&s;e the heart you think you
have a right to po&s;&s;e&s;s! I don't know why the&s;e melan|choly
thoughts have occurred to me; but my &s;pirits
are exceedingly depre&s;&s;ed. Mr. Falkland, I hear,
went out of town to-day. I am glad he is returned to
Oxford, and wi&s;h he had never &s;een London. I am
afraid he has been too much di&s;&s;ipated here; but he
is good, and will recollect him&s;elf: tell him I &s;ay &s;o.
Mr. Main has promi&s;ed to deliver all your letters
carefully to me; therefore do not re&s;train your
pen.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Feb. 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TELL me, Sir Edward, is it the tenure by
which man holds his &s;canty pittance of happi|ne&s;s,
to pay with remor&s;e every plea&s;ure that he
ta&s;tes? What a day of exultation, of rapture, has
this been to me! &s;uch as thou, in thy wild exce&s;&s;es,
could&s;t never have an idea of. But when I have told
you the cau&s;e, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure me, nay, you mu&s;t
&s;wear to me, that I am hone&s;t; for &s;pight of my tran|&s;ports,
&s;omething knocks at my brea&s;t, and whi&s;pers,
&startq;Falkland, thou art a traitor!&endq; Bu&s;y &s;pright, thou
lie&s;t; dare not to interrupt my joy with thy cur&s;ed
croaking.</P>
<P>Having &s;topped to make a vi&s;it on my way hither,
I arrived here late la&s;t night, and &s;et out this morning
about ten o'clock, to pay my re&s;pects at Woodberry.
Mrs. Arnold and Mr. Price, I was told at the gate,
were gone to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the wedding of two of their
friends, who lived about a mile off, and were not ex|pected
home till evening. Mr. Price, it &s;eems, was to
marry them; and Mrs. Arnold, who had be&s;towed a
fortune on the young girl, was to give her away. I
enquired for Mi&s;s Cecilia, and was an&s;wered that &s;he
was at home. I entered the doors with a palpitation
of heart. She flew down &s;tairs to meet me; my arms
involuntarily cla&s;ped her. My deare&s;t Cecilia! Dear
Orlando, how I rejoice to &s;ee you here again! We
entered the parlour together. How beautiful &s;he ap|peared
to me! I thought there was a tenderne&s;s
mixed with plea&s;ure in her looks, that I had never
ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>After forty inquiries, on her &s;ide, relative to the
Audley family, and as many on mine with regard to
her own, we both, for &s;ome time, remained &s;ilent,
each looking as if they wi&s;hed the other would &s;peak.
At length, How comes it, &s;aid &s;he, that you have
<PB N="164" REF="166">
left London &s;o &s;oon? Becau&s;e, &s;aid I, there was no|thing
there that had any charms to retain me. Then
you have brought back your heart, &s;he replied, with
a look that fa&s;cinated me.&mdash;Ah, Cecilia, I brought
it not thither! This an&s;wer e&s;caped me; I knew not
what I &s;aid; yet my words were accompanied with
&s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of countenance as required not an
explanation; a deep vermillion covered her white
&s;kin, even to her neck&mdash;She was &s;ilent for a little
while, then a&s;&s;uming an air of &s;ober command,
Falkland, &s;aid &s;he, tell me <HI>truly,</HI> have you be&s;towed
your affections? An important rea&s;on makes it nece&s;|&s;ary
that you an&s;wer me with &s;incerity.</P>
<P>What a temptation was this, Audley, to be a vil|lain!
Dazzled as I was with hope, my head was
almo&s;t giddy. I &s;eized her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to
my lips, Yes, cried I, I <HI>do</HI> love; you have a right
to know the &s;ecrets of my heart; a heart that was
your <HI>own</HI> before I knew I had one to give! I am &s;a|tisfied,
&s;aid &s;he, re&s;traint and di&s;&s;imulation are at an end.
I wanted but this a&s;&s;urance; and now I will give my
rea&s;on why I refu&s;e my lord V&mdash;. What a noble
frankne&s;s was here! how unlike a <HI>woman!</HI> no af|fected
confu&s;ion, no pretty coyne&s;s, after &s;uch a de|claration!
Amazed, overwhelmed, and penetrated to
the &s;oul, I fell at her feet, and gra&s;ping her knees
with the action of a madman, Oh, Cecilia, cried I,
dare I believe my &s;en&s;es? Is it po&s;&s;ible that the poor
ill-fated wretch you &s;ee before you, the neglected,
the de&s;pi&s;ed Falkland, &s;hould be the object of my
Cecilia's &s;ecret love: Oh, could I have divined what
pa&s;&s;ed in your heart!&mdash;And here, Audley,
recollecting my&s;elf at once, I was upon the point of
declaring&mdash;but fear, or love, or fal&s;hood, call it
what you will, checked my tongue.&mdash;I always
thought you loved me, &s;aid &s;he; yet, Falkland, you
&s;hould have &s;poke fir&s;t, and &s;pared me the pain of
extorting a confe&s;&s;ion from you; had you made it
&s;ooner, it might have &s;aved me from the difficulties
with which I am now embarra&s;&s;ed. And from what
would it have &s;aved <HI>me?</HI> whi&s;pered I to my&s;elf, and
muttering an imprecation, on thy head, Audley.
<PB N="165" REF="167">
Taught from my infancy, replied I, to look upon
you as &s;omething &s;acred, I never dared to let a &s;igh
tran&s;pire before you. 'Twas that, &s;aid &s;he, that
mode&s;t diffidence, that di&s;tru&s;t of your own worth,
that won me, and long &s;ince determined me in your
favour; and if I have till now concealed my &s;enti|ments
for you from all the world, 'twas from an im|pul&s;e
of pride; or perhaps I &s;hould give it a contrary
name, and call it humility. I knew not whether a
youthful inclination (however lively) without encour|agement,
without even hope, would not be extin|gui&s;hed
by ab&s;ence, or perhaps turned to another ob|ject;
but &s;ince I find I am &s;till beloved, what rea&s;on
have I to hide an hone&s;t and well-grounded affection?
Orlando, added &s;he, collecting her &s;weet features
into a grave and even &s;olemn look, I have as little
levity and as much true honour in my &s;oul as any of
my &s;ex; but I will not be a &s;lave to fal&s;e delicacy,
nor &s;acrifice my own happine&s;s to the vanity of my
proud relations. Do you know, pur&s;ued &s;he, with
her u&s;ual quickne&s;s, that my uncle and my lord V&mdash;
are coming down hither? I will throw my&s;elf at my
mama's feet, you &s;hall do the &s;ame; I know &s;he loves
you. If we obtain her con&s;ent, I &s;hall give my&s;elf
but little pain about the di&s;plea&s;ure of the re&s;t of my
family. Trembling with apprehen&s;ion at what I
heard her &s;ay, my thoughts were all confu&s;ion&mdash;
'Twas now too late to make the hateful confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;
I hung down my head, without being able to an&s;wer
her. Are you afraid, &s;aid &s;he, to acknowledge the
truth to my mama? This que&s;tion &s;ugge&s;ted a reply.
I <HI>am,</HI> &s;aid I. Mrs. Arnold will not, I <HI>know</HI> &s;he will
not con&s;ent to my happine&s;s; and a mother's <HI>prohibi|tion</HI>
deprives me, for ever, of my Cecilia. I cannot
con&s;ent to ri&s;que my life (for no le&s;s is at &s;take) upon
the fiat of Mrs. Arnold's lips. Her tenderne&s;s for
you may lead her to forgive a &s;tep, when irrecovera|bly
taken, to which &s;he dare not yield her a&s;&s;ent be|fore-hand.
Mrs. Arnold lives not to her&s;elf, &s;he has
ever been a &s;lave to the capricious will of others.
True, replied Cecilia; yet I think &s;he <HI>might</HI> be pre|vailed
<PB N="166" REF="168">
on. Oh, never, never, &s;aid I. Has &s;he not
as good as given her promi&s;e to lord V&mdash;? invited
his vi&s;its down hither? Your uncle Bidulph comes
with him, to arm his &s;i&s;ter's heart, by his own exam|ple,
with &s;everity again&s;t her child. <HI>I</HI> am bani&s;hed
your pre&s;ence, forbid even to think of you, in&s;ulted
perhaps by the man again&s;t whom, for your &s;ake, I
would not lift my arm; you expo&s;ed to the re|proaches
of your family, and probably to new per&s;e|cutions,
and all this without re&s;ource.&mdash;Ah, my
Cecilia, what con&s;olation would it be to a wretched
lover to think, that for his &s;ake, his beloved devoted
her youth to a &s;ingle life, and &s;uffered thus for her
virtuous con&s;tancy? I had &s;eized her hand while I
&s;poke. She &s;natched it from me, to da&s;h off a tear
that &s;tarted into her eye. If my uncle and my lord
V&mdash;come down hither, &s;aid &s;he, and my per&s;ecu|tion
is again renewed, Falkland, I am afraid, I am
afraid I &s;hall o'erleap the bounds of duty; for force
will make me de&s;perate. Call it not de&s;per|ation,
&s;aid I, to fly for &s;helter to the man that wor|&s;hips
you. Our hands once joined, who can untie
the knot? Let me only conjure you, for the pre&s;ent,
to keep your &s;ecret with the &s;ame caution that you
have hitherto done. Our mutual affection once
known, the con&s;equence would be an eternal &s;epara|tion.
Let us then conceal it, till it will not be in
human power to disjoin us. Though I will never
&s;ubmit, replied &s;he, to have a choice forced on me,
yet &s;hould I be very unwilling to marry without my
mama's approbation; again&s;t her <HI>expre&s;s command I</HI>
certainly never would. There is but this alternative
then, cried I; either to bani&s;h me from your thoughts
for ever, or <HI>venture</HI> to make me happy, without
hazarding an expre&s;s command to the contrary; for
&s;uch be a&s;&s;ured, my Cecilia, you would receive from
your mama, who, bigotted to the tyranny of duty,
would think her&s;elf bound, on this occa&s;ion, to act
conformably to the de&s;ires of her family, though her
own heart, perhaps, would dictate to her much
milder mea&s;ures. Hear my re&s;olution, Falkland,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
&s;aid &s;he, laying her hand on mine. My mother's
repo&s;e is as dear to me as my own. If I can avoid
this match with lord V&mdash;, I will wait patiently till
the re&s;entment of my friends is a little &s;ub&s;ided, when
I am determined at all events, to open my heart to
my mama, and I think &s;he will not &s;acrifice her
daughter's peace of mind to an idle prejudice. But
if, on the contrary, I am to be <HI>compelled</HI> to marry
(for my uncle, I can tell you, is capable of going
&s;uch lengths) this hand, without farther con&s;idera|tion,
is yours.&mdash;Think you not, Audley, that I
ki&s;&s;ed a hundred times that beautiful hand, the
pledge of my future felicity?</P>
<P>Would to heaven my lord V&mdash;and Sir George
Bidulph would come immediately down to Wood|berry,
that my little cha&s;ed fawn might fly for refuge
to my arms! She has hitherto kept her own coun&s;el;
I have conjured her to do &s;o &s;till. Her &s;i&s;ter is too
timid to venture on divulging <HI>her</HI> &s;ecret, unle&s;s it
were to prevent what &s;he will not know till it is too
late for prevention; and then to what purpo&s;e di&s;turb
a peaceful union by a u&s;ele&s;s di&s;covery? Have I then
any rea&s;on to dread con&s;equences? I would fain be
happy; yet there is &s;omething which will not let me,
&s;omething that tells me I have done <HI>wrong.</HI> Yet
how? which way? I have made &s;ome &s;light promi&s;es
to another, extorted from me in a thoughtle&s;s hour
of &s;pleen and di&s;appointment. What is there in that?
Would it not be a greater crime to fulfil than to
break tho&s;e promi&s;es? In one ca&s;e, I bind an unhap|py
girl for ever to a man that cannot love her, and
therefore does not de&s;erve her; in the other, I co&s;t
her a few tears, perhaps, make her fret for a month
or &s;o; &s;he calls me perfidious, di&s;mi&s;&s;es me from her
heart, and there's an end on't. Prithee, Audley, is
not this the fair way of &s;tating the account?</P>
<P>'Tis very late, &s;o I'll e'en to bed, and dream, if I
can, of my beloved.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">
Friday morning.</P>
<P>I broke off here la&s;t night, and threw my&s;elf into
bed in hopes of enjoying over again in &s;leep the plea|&s;ures
of the preceding day; but &s;o &s;uch thing; I
have had a wretched night, and have now &s;tarted up

<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.

<P>OUT upon thee for a vi&s;ionary coxcomb! why
thou wilt dwindle into a mere old woman at
la&s;t. Thou art frighted with a dream! the &s;carecrows
of thy own &s;ickly imagination pur&s;ue thee in thy
&s;leep, and thou very manfully crie&s;t out for help,
<HI>rouze me, encourage me!</HI> Oh, thou chicken-hearted
Falkland, mu&s;t thou be &s;purred on in the road to
happine&s;s? Is there not a green &s;ward all the way
before thee? not a &s;ingle impediment but what thy
own folly creates! Why, under what a triumphant
&s;tar wert thou born! Oh, the &s;weet &s;hepherd of Ida
that holds commerce only with divinities! Whil&s;t
poor I mu&s;t be content with grizettes. Well, I envy
you not your &s;ucce&s;s with Cecilia; <HI>I</HI> but fooled with
her, for I do really love her &s;i&s;ter, and would not
have yielded her to any one but your&s;elf. Things
<PB N="169" REF="171">
are now in the right channel again; you have &s;e|cured
<HI>your</HI> love, help me to do the &s;ame by <HI>mine,</HI> and
I will allow thou <HI>art</HI> a man.</P>
<P>I am entirely of your own opinion that it would
be downright cruelty to keep a poor girl to a &s;illy
promi&s;e, as &s;he her&s;elf declared to my &s;i&s;ter that &s;he
did not know what &s;he was doing when &s;he made it$
and of which, &s;pight of her affection to you, &s;he has
a hundred times repented &s;ince. Sophy, who you
know is much in her confidence, has told me that
Mi&s;s Arnold had often declared to her &s;he would give
the world to recall the ha&s;ty &s;tep &s;he had taken; Not.
added &s;he, but I love Falkland, and would prefer
him to all mankind; but then the di&s;obedience of the
act! the grief it would be to my mama, the re&s;ent|ment
I &s;hall draw on my&s;elf from all my family! I
cannot bear the thoughts of it. Then would &s;he
bur&s;t into tears, and wi&s;h &s;he had never known you.
Why, what a phlegmatic love is this, Falkland! How
unlike the aetherial fire of thy Cecilia! I do verily be|lieve,
and I &s;peak to you now without either raillery
or prejudice, that after the fir&s;t &s;hock which her pride
might receive at finding her&s;elf de&s;erted, &s;he would
at the bottom of her heart be glad that &s;he was ab|&s;olved
from a promi&s;e which terrifies her every time
&s;he thinks of it; and which, you may take it on my
word, you would find it almo&s;t impracticable to make
her fulfil. She would do mighty well to be the
mi&s;tre&s;s of a Don Bellianis, or a Sir Launcelot, who
could afford to wa&s;te &s;even years in &s;trolling up and
down the world, without either meat or drink, in
order to prove his con&s;tancy; and after that would
think him&s;elf fully paid, if he were allowed to bru&s;h
his beard (which he had vowed never to &s;have till he
&s;aw her again) on her lilly white hand through the
grated window of &s;ome inchanted tower. She would
&s;uit to a hair, I &s;ay, a fellow who would be content
thus to love in bu&s;kins; but for us modern gallants,
who have not &s;o much time to throw away on &s;ighing,
give me a girl who has &s;pirit enough to &s;pring out of
a window into our arms; &s;uch a girl as Cecilia, who,
<PB N="170" REF="172">
above di&s;gui&s;e, avows her love, and &s;pite of the &s;tern
brow of parental authority, be&s;tows her per&s;on and
her fortune where &s;he has given her heart. As for
Dolly, 'tis &s;uch a frigid &s;oul that I am amazed how a
&s;park could be kindled in &s;uch an ice-hou&s;e as her
bo&s;om; much puffing and blowing mu&s;t it have co&s;t
the little damon Love to light the flame, and after all
'tis but a &s;ickly blaze, you &s;ee, which like a dying
lamp pops up and down, whil&s;t Duty waits with his
extingui&s;her in his hand, to &s;lop down on it the fir&s;t
moment he catches the little urchin napping.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, Falkland, this fearful girl would
never have courage enough to fulfil her engagement,
till after &s;he had made you &s;erve as long an appren|tice&s;hip
as old father what's-his-name did for his wife.
Things indeed were better managed in tho&s;e days than
they are at pre&s;ent; for a man was then at liberty to
marry two &s;i&s;ters, which was the ca&s;e of the afore|&s;aid
patriarch; and if one could do &s;o &s;till, the affair
might be made very ea&s;y; for you might take Cecilia
how, and I'll engage Dolly would keep cold very well
for about fourteen years.</P>
<P>After all, Falkland, I think the be&s;t thing you can
do, is to make over to me your <HI>imaginary</HI> right (for
a real one you have not) in this girl. I'll take her
with all my &s;oul, and &s;hall not think the wor&s;e of her,
for her having formerly liked a hand&s;omer fellow than
my&s;elf. I'll tru&s;t to her religion to keep her faithful
to me, once I am ve&s;ted with the awful name of
hu&s;band. By the way, tho&s;e prejudices are not
without their u&s;e among&s;t the women, they often
keep the poor things out of mi&s;chief when nothing
el&s;e would. Give it me therefore in black and white
(that we may have no after-reckonings) that you
yield up ail preten&s;ions to Dorothea Arnold, and I'll
take her off your hands.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph goes down to Woodberry.&mdash;Good!
matters mu&s;t then be &s;oon brought to a cri&s;is.
His peevi&s;h wi$e is not &s;o vigilant as him&s;elf; and if
I knew the day, the hour, the minute that united
<PB N="171" REF="173">
you to Cecilia; on that &s;ame day, hour, and minute,
would I po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf of the elder hope of the fa|mily.
I have conceived my plan; but 'tis your hand,
Falkland, mu&s;t help me to execute it; and when our
uncle Bidulph has turned his back, you &s;hall hear
from me to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>MY good genius is at work for me; ble&s;&s;ings
on lord V&mdash;for taking the re&s;olution of
coming down to Woodberry! he arrived there ye&s;ter|day;
little did the fool imagine chat he was coming
on the &s;pur to the de&s;truction of his own hopes.
What a <HI>gracious</HI> reception did he meet with from
Mrs. Arnold! What a delightfully cold one from
my adoreable! Things are, I hope, as you &s;ay,
drawing to a cri&s;is; but this lord V&mdash;is too tempe|rate,
and the elements too equally mixed in his com|po&s;ition;
his breath alone is not &s;ufficient to rai&s;e
the &s;torm that is to drive my Cecilia from the harbour
of her mother's arms; his &s;ighs like gentle breezes
do but li&s;t, and give a livelier motion to the waves,
'Tis Sir George Bidulph, who like the boi&s;terous north
wind, will blow a &s;torm, work all into foam about
him, and force ray little pinnace from her moorings.
Would he were come! But what can his ab&s;ence
from London do for <HI>you?</HI> Do you think it will make
your acce&s;s to Mi&s;s Arnold le&s;s difficult? Be a&s;&s;ured,
Audley, I do mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h her your's, and do
hereby renounce all right and title to her. I am
certain that you would make her a much better
hu&s;band than I &s;hould, and therefore &s;hall be ready
to concur with you in any mea&s;ures to obtain her;
but to tell you the truth, the thing appears &s;o im|practicable
to me, that till I know your plan, I mu&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="174">
con&s;ider your hopes as almo&s;t de&s;perate, and cannot
help being &s;orry for you in the mid&s;t of the tide of
joy that flows in upon my heart.</P>
<P>As for my own part, I begin to be quite recon|ciled
to my&s;elf; and if my &s;olitary hours are &s;ome|times
clouded with a little remor&s;e, the rays of my
Cecilia's eyes di&s;per&s;e it as &s;un-&s;hine does a vapour.</P>

<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
[The letter to which this is an an&s;wer is omitted.]
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 9th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Wi&s;h, my dear, I could give you a &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer
to your enquiries; but I really now think
matters wear a much wor&s;e face than ever they did.
You know I already told you, that having urged
every thing I could in favour of my lord V&mdash;, I
thought it prudent to drop the &s;ubject for &s;ome time,
in hopes Cecilia's gratitude for &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion,
would have more weight with her when l$ft to the
workings of her own heart, than all my brother's
boi&s;terous proceedings, joined to the teizing of lady
Sarah, which my daughter declared had only &s;erved
to heighten her di&s;like to lord V&mdash;, who had been the
innocent cau&s;e of the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he was made to &s;uf|fer.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="177">
Things were in this &s;u&s;pended &s;ituation, when I re|ceived
a polite letter from my lord V&mdash;, begging my
permi&s;&s;ion to pay me a vi&s;it. It was accompanied with
another for Cecilia, full of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect;
but without any of the impatient flights of a lover.
Cecilia &s;aid upon reading it, I wi&s;h my lord V&mdash;would
allow me to enjoy my&s;elf in quiet; he knows I quit|ted
London to avoid him, why will he pur&s;ue me down
hither? I was offended at the peevi&s;h manner in
which &s;he &s;poke, and told her &s;he mu&s;t not pre&s;ume
on my indulgence, to treat with contempt, or even
indifference, the man I &s;o much re&s;pected, and to
who&s;e family I had &s;uch &s;trong obligations. She
&s;eemed aba&s;hed at my rebuke, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould al|ways
behave to lord V&mdash;with that deference and
e&s;teem which &s;he thought due to him. I an&s;wered his
lord&s;hip's letter directly, which he had &s;ent expre&s;s;
and the next evening I had the plea&s;ure to receive him
in per&s;on. With what &s;atisfaction did I embrace the
amiable &s;on of my dear lady V&mdash;, and of her worthy
lord! I had not the lea&s;t recollection of his features,
for it is thirteen years &s;ince I have &s;een him. His no|ble
&s;tature, and military air, give a dignity to his per|&s;on
that recommends him at fir&s;t &s;ight; and I could
not help giving a look of a&s;toni&s;hment at Cecilia, who
was in the room with me when he entered. She re|ceived
him with great civility; but a coldne&s;s which
&s;eemed to mortify him. My &s;on Falkland happened
to be with us; my lord politely &s;aluted, but &s;poke not
to him. Orlando reddened like fire; I &s;aw he had
not forgotten the re&s;entment you formerly told me he
had conceived again&s;t him. I was vexed he happened
to be pre&s;ent, and &s;hould for the boy's &s;ake have taken
care to have prevented this abrupt interview, if I had
thought my lord V&mdash;would have been &s;o expeditious
in making his vi&s;it after the receipt of my letter.</P>
<P>I was de&s;irous my &s;on and he &s;hould be on more
&s;ociable terms; I a&s;ked my lord if he did not think
Mr. Falkland had a &s;trong re&s;emblance to his father?
He replied, he had but an imperfect remembrance of
the elder Mr. Falkland's face, having &s;een him but a
<PB N="3" REF="178">
few times in his life; whence he took occa&s;ion to ad|dre&s;s
my &s;on, and a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions relative
to the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies; (my lord him&s;elf was
bred at the &s;ame univer&s;ity). Mr. Price had now
got upon his favourite topic, and entered with viva|city
into the convention. In the cour&s;e of which,
he took occa&s;ion to mention his pupil's de&s;ign of go|ing
into the army. My lord V&mdash;highly commended
his choice. Orlando received his civilities with cold|ne&s;s,
and very &s;oon took his leave. After he was
gone, his lord&s;hip told me, he &s;hould very &s;oon have
a cornetcy vacant in his regiment, as the officer who
now had the po&s;t, had, on account of very ill health,
de&s;ired leave to quit the army, and meant to return to
England as &s;oon as he was able to endure the fatigue
of the journey. 'Tis at Mr. Falkland's &s;ervice, added
he, and I &s;hould have offered it to the young gentle|man
him&s;elf, had you, Madam, delivered your &s;enti|ments
with regard to the cour&s;e of life of which he
has made choice; but if you approve of it, I &s;hall
think my&s;elf happy in his acceptance of this mark of
my re&s;pect for him. I acknowledged, as it $word$,
this in&s;tance of his lord&s;hip's goodne&s;s and con&s;i$$$|tion
for a youth, who I told him had always been re|garded
by me as a &s;on. Mr. Price expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
as warmly as if the favour had been conferred imme|diately
on him&s;elf; and &s;aid he con&s;idered his young
friend as &s;ingularly happy in being under the patronage
and protection of lord V&mdash;</P>
<P>I indeed thought my&s;elf much obliged to his lord|&s;hip,
yet I know to who&s;e account I ought in reality
to place this mark of his bounty: he thought to plea&s;e
Cecilia by &s;hewing &s;uch a di&s;tinction to her brother;
but &s;he &s;eemed not &s;en&s;ible of his intention, and her
behaviour was con&s;trained for the re&s;t of the evening.</P>
<P>You know I am an early ri&s;er, yet my lord V&mdash;
prevented me the next morning, for I found him in
the parlour when I came down &s;tairs; neither Mr.
Price nor Cecilia were yet &s;tirring.</P>
<P>After our fir&s;t &s;alutations, Well, my dear Madam,
&s;aid he, may I yet flatter my&s;elf with any thing like
<PB N="4" REF="179">
hope? I told him frankly, that I could not &s;ay he had
made the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;s in my daughter's affections;
expre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time my &s;urprize and my con|cern,
and a&s;&s;uring him nothing could give me greater
plea&s;ure than an alliance with his family. I am at
pre&s;ent, &s;aid he, under the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable dilemma
in the world; I came not down hither to importune
Mi&s;s Cecilia; the principal motive of my vi&s;it was to
pay my re&s;pects to you, and I meant not to remind your
daughter of my love by any other marks of it than
my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and my a&s;&s;iduity to plea&s;e.; but Sir
George Bidulph told me on the eve of my departure
from London, that he meant &s;oon to follow me down
hither. Now as I am very much afraid that his in|terfering
too warmly will rather de&s;troy than promote
my intere&s;ts, I ventured to hint this tenderly to Sir
George, in&s;inuating at the &s;ame time that I &s;hould
have better hopes of &s;ucceeding, if he would permit
me to pur&s;ue my own method in endeavouring to gain
his niece's affections, who, I &s;aid, I thought had al|ready
been too much urged. He laughed, and told
me, I did not know her, but I dare not repeat to you
all Sir George &s;aid on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered his lord&s;hip, that I knew my brother's
manner, and therefore begged he would &s;peak freely.
You mu&s;t not then be angry, replied lord V&mdash;, but
the&s;e were Sir George's words; &startq;Cecilia is vain, and
loves to be admired. She has had her little brain
turned with flattery, and fancies &s;he ought not to
give up her power under a romantic court&s;hip of &s;e|ven
years. Her mother&endq; (remember, Madam, you
are not to be angry with me) &startq;has &s;poiled her by too
great an indulgence; and an ab&s;urd old relation of
ours has made her &s;till more untractable, by leaving
her a fortune in her own power. Though I have a
perfect good opinion of her, yet I think a girl thus
circum&s;tanced, as &s;he has it in her power, &s;o &s;he
may have it a <HI>little</HI> in her inclination to chu&s;e for
her&s;elf, and who can an&s;wer for the choice of inex|perienced
youth? I believe as yet her heart has re|ceived
no impre&s;&s;ions. She had three adorers whil&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="180">
&s;he was with me, be&s;ides your lord&s;hip; but &s;he
&s;hewed not the lea&s;t liking to any of them; and her
&s;i&s;ter, on who&s;e word I am &s;ure I can rely, declared
&s;he believed her inclinations entirely di&s;engagcd. 'Tis
upon this a&s;&s;urance, therefore, that I have been the
more peremptory with her, as I con&s;ider her de|clining
your hand merely as the re&s;ult of ob&s;tinacy
and caprice; and if we give way to her in this in|&s;tance,
relying perhaps on the fond partiality of her
friends, her next &s;tep may be to give us a relation,
who po&s;&s;ibly may have no other merit, but what her
fancy di&s;covers in him. Lady S$rah and my&s;elf, ad|ded
Sir George, de&s;ire ardently to &s;ee her your's.
My &s;i&s;ter and Mi&s;s Arnold both profe&s;s to do the
&s;ame; my lady V&mdash;'s &s;entiments, you know, agree
with ours, &s;o do tho&s;e of all our friends.&mdash;&endq; I in|terrupted
Sir George here; But if the &s;entiments of
the lady her&s;elf, &s;aid I, are aver&s;e to me, I am not a
lover &s;o void of delicacy as to &s;eize an unwilling hand,
joined to mine merely by the authority of parents.
P&s;ha, cried Sir George, 'tis &s;uch lovers as you who
make the women &s;o in&s;olent; do you think it ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary that the lady whom you marry &s;hould
be as much in love with you as you are with her? I
told him, No; but that I thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
that there &s;hould be at lea&s;t no <HI>di&s;like</HI> on the part
of the lady. Sir George was here plea&s;ed to pay me
&s;ome unmerited compliments, and bid me at the &s;ame
time recollect that you, Madam, who had not only
married without inclination, but, as he believed, with
&s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of another, had made
a mo&s;t exemplary wife even in the mo&s;t trying circum|&s;tances;
and he was convinced you had had as &s;incere
an affection for Mr. Arnold as if he had been the man
of your choice. I &s;topped my lord here, to a&s;&s;ure
him that my brother had &s;poken the truth. All this I
own then, Madam, pur&s;ued he, has encouraged me
to per&s;evere; but what at pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es me is, that
I am apprehen&s;ive, when Sir George comes down to
Woodberry, he will be for pu&s;hing matters to an ex|tremity;
for he declared, if his niece continued ob|&s;tinate,
<PB N="6" REF="181">
that he would renounce her! What &s;hall we
do, dear Madam? added he, for I &s;olemnly aver to
you, that pa&s;&s;ionately as I love Mi&s;s Cecilia Arnold,
I would de&s;i&s;t from my pur&s;uit &s;ooner than draw on
her the re&s;entment of her friends, if I thought that
would be a means of pre&s;erving her from it; but
matters have already gone &s;o far, that even that would
be attributed to her by Sir George as a &s;ubject of com|plaint
equal to a peremptory refu&s;al on her &s;ide. I
told his lord&s;hip he had formed a very ju&s;t conclu&s;ion,
as the blame mu&s;t certainly light on Cecilia, let our
di&s;appointment in this union wear what face it would:
I $word$, of no means then to be pur&s;ued, added I,
bu$ $uffer my brother to be <HI>deci&s;ive</HI> on this occa&s;ion.
If $word$ daughter's reluctance does not amount to aver|&s;ion,
(which I have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to think it
does) &s;he will certainly yield rather than forfeit her
uncle's regard; and, in that ca&s;e, you may depend on
the goodne&s;s of her heart for a &s;uitable return to your
tenderne&s;s. On the other hand, if her caprice is in|&s;urmountable,
I know &s;he has &s;pirit enough to be re&s;o|lute
in her refu&s;al, let the con&s;equences be what they
will. If this &s;hould be the i&s;&s;ue, Madam, replied lord
V&mdash;, I mu&s;t conjure you not to let Cecilia feel a <HI>mo|ther</HI>'s
re&s;entment, as well as that of her other rela|tions;
remember the <HI>heart</HI> is not at our own di&s;po&s;al.&mdash;
How I admire the genero&s;ity of this worthy young no|bleman!</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the four or five intermediate days
$word$ my brother's arrival, in all which time Orlando ne|ver
came near us, though Mr. Price writ to him to let
him know my lord V&mdash;'s kind intentions towards him,
and recommended it to him to come and thank his
lord&s;hip. I am afraid this youth is of a proud and
vindictive &s;pirit?</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;all this while never entertained
Cecilia on the &s;ubject of his love. She &s;eemed to
li&s;ten to him with plea&s;ure on every other topic, and
the poor man appeared to me to be afraid of forfeiting
this &s;atisfaction, by touching on the only &s;tring which
he knew would make di&s;cord.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="182">
Having had no previous notice of my brother's in|tended
vi&s;it but what I received from lord V&mdash;,
who did not him&s;elf know the preci&s;e time of his com|ing,
he came upon us a little abruptly la&s;t night ju&s;t
as we were &s;itting down to &s;upper. Cecilia turned
pale on his entering the room; and I thought Sir
George &s;eemed at a lo&s;s what face to wear towards
her, as he had re&s;olved to deport him&s;elf accordingly
as he &s;hould find her di&s;po&s;ed towards lord V&mdash;</P>
<P>How amiable was my lord V&mdash;'s conduct on this
occa&s;ion! He affected an appearance of &s;atisfaction,
which I knew he was very far from feeling at his heart;
he even a&s;&s;umed an ea&s;e in his behaviour towards his
mi&s;tre&s;s, which gave him the air of a lover who was
far from being di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>Cecilia's unea&s;ine&s;s was too vi&s;ible not to be ob&s;erved
by my brother. He only waned till the &s;ervants were
withdrawn to a&s;k her too roughly, I thought, whe|ther
&s;he &s;till retained the &s;ame <HI>pretty inflexibility</HI> which
&s;he had carried with her out of town? She made no
reply. Softly, my dear Sir George, &s;aid my lord, we
mu&s;t not have our happine&s;s di&s;turbed by har&s;h inter|rogations;
I never enjoyed &s;o perfect a &s;atisfaction as
I have done for the&s;e la&s;t five days. You then are
come to the u&s;e of your rea&s;on, niece, rejoined my
brother, looking at Cecilia with a &s;ort of plea&s;ure
mixed with di&s;tru&s;t. I tell you again, &s;aid my lord,
&s;miling, we won't be interrogated; Mi&s;s Cecilia is all
goodne&s;s, all conde&s;cen&s;ion. I am extremely glad to
hear it, cried my brother.&mdash;Si&s;ter! Mr. Price! what
&s;ay you? for a lover's word is not always to be de|pended
on with regard to his mi&s;tre&s;s. Mr. Price was
&s;ilent, only by a little nod of his head indicated that
he had no great hopes of the bu&s;ine&s;s. I can't tell
how to an&s;wer you, brother, &s;aid I. Ha, I thought
&s;o, cried my brother. Pray, my lord, to what may
Mi&s;s's <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> have amounted? To fit in the &s;ame
room with you, perhaps, or &s;uffer you to take up her
glove if &s;he happened to drop it? Cecilia &s;at biting her
lips, her looks full of vexation. Mr. Price began to
pat &s;oftly under the table with his foot, which is a ha|bit
<PB N="8" REF="183">
he has given him&s;elf when he is di&s;contented with
any thing. I have no rea&s;on to complain, Sir George,
&s;aid my lord V&mdash;, with that a&s;&s;ured tone which hope
in&s;pires. I'll be &s;acrificed, cried my brother, if you
have gained an inch of ground &s;ince you came down
hither! I flatter my&s;elt I have lo&s;t none, an&s;wered
lord V&mdash;, and I am perfectly &s;atisfied with my pro&s;pect
of happine&s;s, however di&s;tant it may be. I honour
your lord&s;hip's patience extremely, &s;aid Sir George,
though it is a virtue of which I never had the good
fortune to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. I have not the lea&s;t objection,
continued he, to a man's going through all the cere|monials
of a lover for a few months, provided he is
$word$ not to be di&s;appointed in the end; but (excu&s;e
me, ladies) I would not &s;acrifice my time to any of
you, unle&s;s I had an ab&s;olute certainty of obtaining my
wi&s;hes; which I own, my lord, does not &s;eem to be
your ca&s;e. I am, neverthele&s;s, &s;atisfied to wait, Sir
George; the experiment is well worth the trial; and
I am re&s;olved to be indebted to no one but the lady
her&s;elf for a happine&s;s, which, from that circum&s;tance,
would come with redoubled value. Mighty well, &s;aid
my brother, I &s;ee we are likely to advance wonder|fully:
your lord&s;hip, however, mu&s;t take your own
way. I thank you, Sir George, &s;aid my lord V&mdash;.
What news is there in London? This que&s;tion gave
the conver&s;ation another turn, and we chatted on in|different
things till my u&s;ual hour of retiring, when
my lord V&mdash;ro&s;e and wi&s;hed us a good-night. Mr.
Price, who had, in complai&s;ance to my brother, al|ready
exceeded his cu&s;tomary hour of going to bed,
followed him immediately. Cecilia was now going to
withdraw, when my brother reque&s;ted &s;he would &s;tay
a few minutes; &s;he &s;at down again in her place. I
&s;ee, &s;aid he, from what has pa&s;&s;ed this evening, that
my lord V&mdash;. is ju&s;t where he &s;et out at fir&s;t. I
was in hopes, Cecilia, that your mother's per&s;onal in|fluence
would by this time have been able to &s;ubdue
that unpardonable ob&s;tinacy, which has already &s;o
much di&s;gu&s;ted all your friends; but as I find it has
had no effect, I &s;hall de&s;ire no other favour of you than
<PB N="9" REF="184">
to an&s;wer me one plain que&s;tion, which I wi&s;h to have
re&s;olved as well for your own credit, as for the peace
of mind of my lord V&mdash;. He thinks you have
been too much pre&s;&s;ed by your friends; perhaps you
think &s;o too; and that you &s;hould have had more time
allowed you to cultivate &s;uch an e&s;teem for him as
would voluntarily induce you to make him your choice.
He is willing to leave this de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue to time; tell
me truly, then, if your friends are &s;atisfied to indulge
you in this, if you think you can then bring your&s;elf
to accept of lord V&mdash;for a hu&s;band? Beware of
playing the coquet, child, (&s;eeing &s;he an&s;wered not
directly) my lord V&mdash;is not a man to fool with;
an&s;wer me without eva&s;ion; I have an opinion of your
frankne&s;s; if you require the foppery of a few months
dangling, why, be it &s;o, I &s;hall leave his lord&s;hip to
pur&s;ue his love-proce&s;s according to his own me|thod.
Cecilia, who had kept her eyes fixed on the
table whil&s;t her uncle &s;poke, now rai&s;ed them to his
face, You will not, I hope, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, be offend|ed
if I an&s;wer you with that &s;incerity you require
of me: I cannot think of lord V&mdash;for a hu&s;|band.
She withdrew her eyes again from Sir George's
face, in which I &s;aw indignation beginning to kin|dle
You prefer Sir Edward Audley, perhaps? Be|lieve
me, Sir, I never entertained a thought of him.
&mdash;Mr. Hyndford po&s;&s;ibly, or Mr. Gage? (you
know they were both her admirers) Indeed, Sir, I
like neither of them.&mdash;Was there ever &s;uch an
unaccountable little wretch! &s;aid Sir George, an|grily.
Only I can't think you &s;o void of pride, and
&s;o regardle&s;s of the honour of your family, I &s;hould
think you had &s;et your heart on &s;ome one you are
a&s;hamed to name! And apropos, &s;i&s;ter, what is your
charge, Mr. Falkland, doing at pre&s;ent? The man|ner
in which my brother &s;poke this, and the indignant
eye he fixed on Cecilia, &s;hewed too plainly where his
&s;u&s;picions pointed. I thought ju&s;t then of what you,
my $word$, formerly hinted to me, and felt my&s;elf ex|ceedings
&s;hocked. However blind Cecilia may be
with regard to my lord V&mdash;, replied I, I am &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="10" REF="185">
neither her prudence nor her duty would &s;uffer
her to engage her affections, contrary to the intere&s;ts
as well as happine&s;s of her family. You forget, cried
Sir George, that young ladies brought up in &s;hady
groves, by murmuring rills, always con&s;ult the incli|nations
of their own hearts, before they do that of the
intere&s;ts of their family;
<Q>&startq;For what are titles, wealth, or fame, to love.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The &s;arca&s;tic air with which my brother accompa|nied
this, &s;eemed to cut Cecilia to the quick. She
turned towards me, and with a &s;pirited action catching
me by the hand, if I am permitted, Madam, &s;aid &s;he,
to decline my lord V&mdash;'s alliance, you will find I &s;hall
ju&s;tify the opinion you are &s;o good as to have of me;
for I here promi&s;e you, that however I may be im|pelled
by inclination, (for I will not pretend to an&s;wer
for my own heart) I will never tran&s;gre&s;s the duty I
owe you. And &s;o your friends are to &s;it down con|tented,
ma'am, on the &s;trength of this equivocation,
&s;aid my brother, to wait till your capricious lady&s;hip
&s;hall find your&s;elf in the humour to obey them! May
not the &s;ame &s;peech &s;erve your turn for any other
match that may be propo&s;ed to you? If you have
taken the re&s;olution to live &s;ingle, you had be&s;t &s;ay &s;o
at once? Sir, I have made no &s;uch re&s;olution.&mdash;
Very well, Mi&s;s, you may retire; we'll talk to you
farther on this &s;ubject to-morrow.</P>
<P>I know not what to make of this girl, &s;aid Sir
George, (after &s;he was gone out of the room) but this
much I am &s;ure of, there mu&s;t be &s;omething more at
the bottom of all this than di&s;like of my lord V&mdash;:
if her heart be engaged, it is, (I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed
to &s;ay it) but it is, it mu&s;t be to Falkland; for be a&s;|&s;ured,
Sidney, that young fellow inherits all the art of
his d&mdash;n'd mother.&mdash;Dear brother, how can you
be &s;o implacable? You have already, &s;aid he, been
a martyr to your own credulity, and that of other peo|ple;
for Heaven's &s;ake, &s;i&s;ter, at length learn a little
worldly wi&s;dom. I know Falkland hates lord V&mdash;,
and without in&s;i&s;ting on his being him&s;elf the favourite
<PB N="11" REF="186">
of Cecilia, I am certain he &s;ecretly puts her again&s;t
him, for &s;he was more deci&s;ive in her rejection of him
to-night than ever I heard her before. I could not
help agreeing with him in this ob&s;ervation. I think
then, &s;aid he, the &s;eldomer you admit of his vi&s;its the
better; and I &s;hall take it as a favour, if you will
at lea&s;t prevent them whil&s;t I continue here; for I
would by no means chu&s;e to &s;ee him after what pa&s;&s;ed
between us, the particulars of which I &s;uppo&s;e your
daughter may have informed you. I told him Mr.
Falkland had never come to my hou&s;e &s;ince the fir&s;t
night of my lord's arrival, when they happened to
meet; and at the &s;ame time I let him know the oblig|ing
offer my lord V&mdash;had made him. 'Tis more than
he de&s;erves at his hands, &s;aid my brother, and had I
thought it worth while to inform lord V&mdash;of his au|dacious
behaviour, I believe the young man would
have received a compliment of a very different nature
from him; but I am glad that I had caution enough
not to trouble him with the petulance of a forward
boy, and am now extremely plea&s;ed that Falkland is
likely to be &s;ent out of the way.</P>
<P>I intended &s;ending off this letter to you to-day; but
as it is already of an uncon&s;cionable &s;ize for the po&s;t.
I will defer &s;ending it till to-morrow, when I &s;hall have
the opportunity of a private hand; for I am ju&s;t this
minute told, that one of lord V&mdash;'s &s;ervants is ar|rived
from London with &s;ome di&s;patches to him, and
that he is to return again to town to-morrow, I have
not yet quitted my chamber this morning; but I am
now &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t, &s;o here I will lay down
my pen.</P>
<P>Monday night.</P>
<P>Nothing, my Cecilia, nothing but fre&s;h embarra&s;&s;|ments;
where they will end Heaven only knows; My
lord V&mdash;received a packet of letters from Lon|don
this morning, and among&s;t others, one which
brought him an account of the death of that officer,
who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion he had promi&s;ed to Orlando. My
lord V&mdash;lamented him as a very worthy man
and a good officer; but declared his &s;atisfaction at the
<PB N="12" REF="187">
&s;ame time, at having it in his power to fulfil his pro|mi&s;e
to Mr. Falkland &s;ooner than he expected. My
brother immediately laid hold on the hint, and &s;aid he
thought Mr. Falkland &s;hould be very glad to embrace
&s;uch an opportunity of entering immediately into &s;er|vice,
as the campaign would probably &s;oon open; and
that, in his mind, he could not do better than &s;et out
immediately for the regiment. My lord V&mdash;was
of the &s;ame opinion, &s;aying, as the military life was
altogether new to the young man, it might be of ad|vantage
to him to be a little acquainted with it before
he was called into the field. What's your opinion,
&s;i&s;ter? &s;aid Sir George. My lord and you are &s;uch
good judges of the que&s;tion, an&s;wered I, that I can|not
he&s;itate a minute in agreeing with you. What
&s;ay you, my good Sir? (to Mr. Price). I am entire|ly
of your mind, &s;aid Mr. Price, and think the army
it&s;elf the propere&s;t &s;chool to fit him for his profe&s;&s;ion.
And you, Mi&s;s Cecilia, (rivetting his eyes on my
daughter's face) what do you think? She lifted not
her's from off her work, but with a deep blu&s;h, re|plied,
I think as you do, Sir. I wi&s;h you did &s;o in
<HI>other</HI> re&s;pects, an&s;wered my brother, coldly. I ob|&s;erved
my lord V&mdash;'s eyes had been turned to|wards
Cecilia from the time Sir George had put the
que&s;tion to her. Her too apparent confu&s;ion had a
vi&s;ible effect on him; he turned pale, and ri&s;ing off
his chair, went out of the room. Sir George &s;aid it
would be proper to apprize Falkland of the affair, that
he might get him&s;elf in readine&s;s with all convenient
&s;peed; a line from you, &s;i&s;ter; will be &s;ufficient on
this occa&s;ion. I &s;uppo&s;e he will not require much
time for preparation. I &s;aid I would go and write to
him directly. I had but ju&s;t got into my clo&s;et, when
my brother tapped at the door, and telling me he
wanted to &s;peak with me, begg'd I would allow him
a few minutes convention. Having let him in, Do
you think, &s;aid he, with his u&s;ual abruptne&s;s, that
your daughter has be&s;towed her affections on Falkland,
or not? for I am &s;atisfied <HI>you,</HI> as well as I, ob&s;erved
the agitation into which &s;he was thrown on the men|tion
<PB N="13" REF="188">
of his departure. I did, an&s;wered I, and am
exceedingly alarmed at it. A mean-&s;pirited little
d&mdash;I, &s;aid he, &s;tamping with his foot! is the
cur&s;e of worthle&s;s hu&s;bands to be entailed on the fa|mily!
Softly, dear Sir George.&mdash;Softly! cried
he, I have not patience to think of &s;uch a depravity
of mind: admirable fruits of her education indeed
we are to expect, when we &s;ee her prefer to &s;uch a
man as lord V&mdash;a little in&s;ignificant wretch,
without family, fortune, or even name! Oh, Sidney,
&s;ee what your imprudent charity has done! Spare
$word$ reproaches, dear brother; if the thing be as you
&s;u&s;pect&mdash;<HI>If</HI> it be! interrupted he, why can you
have any doubt about it? One thing, however, let me
warn you again&s;t; do not examine your daughter on
the &s;ubject; I know the a&s;cendancy &s;he has over you,
and how ea&s;ily your heart is to be melted; the &s;ecret
once declared, the young lady will have no more mea|&s;ures
to ob&s;erve; 'tis from her pride only that I enter|tain
the lea&s;t hopes of turning her from this &s;canda|lous
attachment. Whil&s;t &s;he believes us ignorant of it,
perhaps &s;he may be a&s;hamed to acknowledge it; and
if we can get Falkland fairly out of the way, a little
time may probably bring her to her&s;elf. The oppor|tunity
which now offers to &s;end him out of the king|dom
mu&s;t by no means be let &s;lip. My coldne&s;s to|wards
him (which he very well knows) will be a &s;uffi|cient
excu&s;e for your not a&s;king him here whil&s;t I re|main
with you, which I purpo&s;e doing till he leaves
England: this you &s;ee will cut off all communication
between him and Cecilia; after he is gone, I fancy we
&s;hall have le&s;s difficulty to manage her. This was
what I wanted chiefly to &s;ay to you, what do you
think of it?</P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t objection to your de&s;ign, an|&s;wered
I; only I think it would be proper that both
my lord V&mdash;and I &s;hould &s;ee Mr. Falkland be|fore
he goes away; and it would appear very particu|lar
even to my lord him&s;elf, if Orlando were not per|mitted
to take his leave of Cecilia. I hate tho&s;e <HI>tak|ings
of leave</HI> an&s;wered Sir George; however, when
<PB N="14" REF="189">
he is in readine&s;s to depart, that may be contrived;
but let me of all things advi&s;e you not to &s;uffer it to
be done in the pre&s;ence of lord V&mdash;, left Cecilia's
emotions &s;hould betray her folly; and lord V&mdash;
knows the world too well to be impo&s;ed on by the
pretence of <HI>&s;i&s;terly</HI> affection. My brother left me at
the&s;e words, and I &s;at down directly to my e&s;cruitore
to write a few lines to Orlando, wherein I informed
him of the news my lord V&mdash;had received this
morning, and that in con&s;equence of it, it was thought
expedient by his friends (I named my&s;elf, lord V&mdash;,
and Mr. Price) that he &s;hould repair immediately to
the regiment. I de&s;ired him to be&s;peak every thing
that was nece&s;&s;ary for this expedition, telling him that
Mr. Price &s;hould call on him in a day or two with
whatever &s;um of money he &s;hould want; and that as
I found my brother &s;till retained a &s;trong re&s;entment
again&s;t him, I mu&s;t deprive my&s;elf of the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing him whil&s;t Sir George continued at Woodberry,
hinting at the &s;ame time we would contrive to meet
before he left the country, I &s;ent my letter off di|rectly,
and in return received a note from Orlando,
promi&s;ing he would obey my in&s;tructions. He writ a
letter at the &s;ame time to lord V&mdash;politely thank|ing
him for the honour he had conferred on him.</P>
<P>I can add nothing more to this very long letter
but my own di&s;agreeable reflections. Indeed, my
dear, I am now exceedingly afraid that my poor un|happy
girl loves&mdash;Oh, Cecilia, my hand &s;hakes
when I add the name of Falkland! Your &s;urmi&s;es
on the occa&s;ion I thought not well founded; for I
concluded I my&s;elf mu&s;t have been the fir&s;t to di&s;cover
this fatal inclination. Is it not amazing that a crea|ture,
who has never been from under my own eye,
&s;hould have been able with &s;o much art to conceal
a &s;ecret of this nature? Yet I hope it has proceeded
no farther than a &s;ecret preference of Falkland in her
own heart; but if their love &s;hould be mutual and
acknowledged! Good God, in what a dreadful &s;itua|tion
are we all! Yet I cannot inform my&s;elf as to this;
<HI>you</HI> fir&s;t advi&s;ed me again&s;t examining Cecilia on the
<PB N="15" REF="190">
&s;ubject, and I followed your advice, yet more in com|pliance
to a judgment which I think &s;uperior to my
own, than a per&s;ua&s;ion in that particular in&s;tance of
its being rightly formed. My brother entering pretty
much into the &s;ame &s;entiments with you, has laid on me
the &s;ame injunction; I now &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of it, and
have promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve it. Perhaps the ab&s;ence of
Orlando may work a favourable change for lord V&mdash;, I
&s;hould be exceedingly grieved at parting with him if I
had not this de&s;irable point in view, for I would fain flat|ter
my&s;elf that Cecilia's attachment may be at bottom
but a childi&s;h inclination which will dye of it&s;elf when
the object is removed from her &s;ight. I ob&s;erved when
&s;he &s;at down to dinner, that her eyes looked as if &s;he
had been weeping, yet &s;he affected to be as chearful as
u&s;ual; my brother &s;eemed plea&s;ed with this effort of
her's; it ju&s;tified his &s;agacity in &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he would
be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> to give way to a weakne&s;s of which &s;he
did not &s;uppo&s;e her friends &s;u&s;pected her. My lord
V&mdash;was melancholy and frequently ab&s;ent, yet
abated not of his tender attention to Cecilia; I be|lieve
our thoughts all centered in the &s;ame point, how|ever
differently we were affected.</P>
<P>Heaven &s;end a favourable i&s;&s;ue to an event which
now hangs in &s;uch &s;u&s;pence!&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mi&s;s CECILIA ARNOLD to Mi&s;s ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is come, the hour is at length arrived,
when it is permitted Cecilia to unlock her bo|&s;om
and pour out the &s;ecrets of it into that of her dear
Dolly; yet do not look down upon me, my &s;weet philo|&s;ophic
&s;i&s;ter, becau&s;e perhaps your loftier mind is inca|pable
<PB N="16" REF="191">
of a weakne&s;s to which my feebler rea&s;on has
yielded. You know I am a proud little hu&s;&s;y, and
cannot bear contempt.</P>
<P>[She then proceeds to give her &s;i&s;ter an account of
the mutual affection between her and Mr. Falkland,
with the manner of their di&s;clo&s;ing it to each other,
pretty nearly as Mr. Falkland has already related it in
his letter to Sir Edward Audley; after which, &s;he tells
her of the particulars that occurred from the time of Sir
George Bidulph's arrival at Woodberry down to the
period where Mrs. Arnold concludes her la&s;t letter
and then continues:]</P>
<P>I judged from every thing I ob&s;erved that my uncle
&s;u&s;pected Mr. Falkland to be the man whom in the
bottom of my heart I favoured; and that this more
than any thing el&s;e had determined him to ha&s;ten his
departure out of the kingdom. I &s;aw too plainly that
my mama, in regard to my marriage with lord V&mdash;,
meant to yield up her natural right in the di&s;po&s;al of
me, and to delegate her power to Sir George; and I
had rea&s;on to believe that my lord V&mdash;'s pa&s;&s;ion for
me was &s;trong enough to &s;urmount the &s;cruples which
his delicacy might otherwi&s;e have thrown in his way,
with re&s;pect to a woman who he was convinced enter|tained
not any inclination for him, provided he thought
her indifference proceeded not from any prior engage|ment
of her affections, and this was a point of which
I judged both my mama and my uncle would labour
to per&s;uade him. The former, from really entertain|ing
no &s;u&s;picions of the truth; the latter, from a be|lief
that I dared not acknowledge it. All the&s;e con|clu&s;ions
I drew from &s;everal little ob&s;ervations I had
made at different times, upon their different conduct.
What part could I chu&s;e in &s;uch a dilemma? I had
promi&s;ed Falkland to be his at once, in ca&s;e I &s;aw no
means of e&s;caping the other match. He pre&s;&s;ed me
to the accompli&s;hment of this promi&s;e; yet my love
for <HI>him</HI> could not &s;o far extingui&s;h that which I $ear
my mama, as to think of this without &s;huddering. I
re&s;olved therefore on an expedient which you, I be|lieve,
will think a &s;trange one, yet the event ju&s;tified
<PB N="17" REF="192">
my prudence in making choice of it. This was no
other than opening my heart to lord V&mdash;him&s;elf,
and imploring even his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t his own in|tere&s;ts,
the intere&s;ts of his love!</P>
<P>After forming my de&s;ign, I was not &s;low in exe|cuting
it. I writ two lines to my lord V&mdash;where|in
I told him I had &s;omething important to &s;ay to him,
and begg'd he would meet me next morning at &s;even
o'clock in the cedar parlour. This room, you know,
as we hardly ever make u&s;e of it, &s;ecured me again&s;t
the fear of interruption, even from the &s;ervants. I
ventured to leave my little note my&s;elf on my lord's
dre&s;&s;ing table, where I knew he mu&s;t find it when he
retired to his chamber to go to bed.</P>
<P>I was &s;o agitated the whole night at the thoughts of
what I had to &s;ay to <HI>him,</HI> and what he might &s;urmi&s;e
of <HI>me</HI> in the interim, that I &s;lept not a wink, and as
&s;oon as I &s;aw broad day-light, I aro&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf,
and &s;oftly crept down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>It was but three quarters pa&s;t &s;ix; but my lord had
prevented me, and was already in the parlour. I &s;aid
I hoped I had not made him wait, and referred him
to his watch to &s;hew that it was not yet the appointed
hour. In matters of mere bu&s;ine&s;s, Madam, &s;aid he,
a man may &s;atisfy him&s;elf with being barely punctual;
but where the concerns of the heart are at &s;take, he
mu&s;t be a flegmatic lover indeed who is not a little be|fore
his time.</P>
<P>I &s;elt my&s;elf exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed; I &s;carce knew
how to begin the conver&s;ation. My lord V&mdash;
has a manly &s;teadine&s;s in his deportment that in&s;pires
one with a kind of awe; I almo&s;t wi&s;hed my&s;elf in my
own chamber again, but it was now too late. I made
a motion for him to &s;it down, he did &s;o, and I took
my place oppo&s;ite to him. He remained &s;ilent, though
with an impatience in his looks mingled with love and
re&s;pect. I collected my&s;elf as well as I could, and
addre&s;&s;ing him. If I had not, &s;aid I, the highe&s;t
opinion in the world of your lord&s;hip's genero&s;ity, as
well as of your prudence and the goodne&s;s of your
heart, I had not dared to take the &s;tep I have now
<PB N="18" REF="193">
done. I mu&s;t believe your curio&s;ity is excited to know
what I have to &s;ay; my lord, I mean to open my
whole heart to you. He bowed to me, and I thought
&s;eemed to tremble from head to foot, which, little
coward as I am, encouraged me to proceed. I &s;hould
be both in&s;en&s;ible and ungrateful, continued I, if I
were not full of acknowlegements for the kind &s;enti|ments
with which you honour me, and for the ex|treme
delicacy you have ob&s;erved towards me; but,
my lord, when I &s;ay I acknowlege both, I mu&s;t add
that I can only do it with gratitude and e&s;teem; the
return you de&s;ire is not in my power to make. I own
you de&s;erve my heart; but that was be&s;towed long
before you favoured me with your affection, otherwi&s;e
I &s;hould allow my&s;elf to be unju&s;t in not giving you
the preference of which I think you &s;o worthy. My
lord bowed again. I <HI>owed</HI> you this explanation, my
lord, continued I, and &s;hould (exclu&s;ive of any other
rea&s;ons) have thought my&s;elf bound to make it, as
well in ju&s;tification of my own conduct, (which mu&s;t
otherwi&s;e appear very capricious) as to &s;hew you the
entire confidence I have in you. Having gone thus
far, my lord, I mean not to &s;top here, I will not con|fide
in you by halves; Mr. Falkland is the per&s;on
who has had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my affections; and
to deal plainly with you, I never can think of making
any other man my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I thank you, Madam, an&s;wered my lord V&mdash;and
admire your &s;incerity, though it has confirmed my
de&s;pair.&mdash;I know, proceeded I, what my uncle's
de&s;igns are; from &s;ome hints he dropt, I am &s;atisfied
that he &s;u&s;pects I love Mr. Falkland; he is earne&s;t to
get him out of the way; I &s;ee well the mea&s;ures he
intends to pur&s;ue after that; he is extremely per&s;ever|ing
in every thing he wi&s;hes to accompli&s;h; he has
your lord&s;hip's alliance much at heart&mdash;He inter|rupted
me here with &s;ome vivacity, And can you think
&s;o meanly of me, Madam. &s;aid he, as to believe that
after the declaration you have ju&s;t now made, I would
like a ravi&s;her &s;eize your reluctant hand? No, Ma|dam,
precious as I &s;hould e&s;teem the gift were it vo|luntarily
<PB N="19" REF="194">
be&s;towed, I would not accept it when forced
on me by the authority of a parent. Pardon me, my
lord, an&s;wered I; I entertain not the lea&s;t doubt of
the genero&s;ity of your way of thinking; but every
man is not &s;o delicate. There may be &s;ome who
would not &s;cruple to take me even circum&s;tanced as
you know me to be; and my uncle's prejudices are &s;o
&s;trong again&s;t Mr. Falkland, that once he is gone,
though your lord&s;hip were even out of the que&s;tion&mdash;My
lord again intrrrupted me; How grieved am I,
Madam, &s;aid he, that you are &s;o &s;oon to be &s;eparated
from the object of your love; but do you wi&s;h that I
&s;hould contrive to po&s;tpone Mr. Falkland's journey till
I go my&s;elf to join the army, which will not be for
&s;ome time? I cannot now recall the charge I have be|&s;towed
on him; had I &s;ooner known the intere&s;t you
have in him, I would not have been the means of ex|po&s;ing
to the chance of war a life &s;o precious to you;
but be a&s;&s;ured, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Arnold, I &s;hall have the
warme&s;t attention to his pre&s;ervation, his intere&s;t, and
his honour. I will forget that he is my rival while I
con&s;ider him only as one that is dear to you. I could
not refrain from tears. Oh, my lord, you oppre&s;s me,
&s;aid I: &s;entiments &s;o noble!&mdash;&s;o virtuous! why
have not I a heart to give you! Yet do not think &s;o
&s;lightly of me as to believe I have any reluctance to
Mr. Falkland's pur&s;uing the paths of honour which
you have chalked out for him; I rely &s;tedfa&s;tly on the
promi&s;e you have given me, and if he &s;hould happen
to fall, I think I have &s;trength of mind enough to
con&s;ole my&s;elf by reflecting on the cau&s;e. A manly
tear &s;prung into my lord V&mdash;'s eye, which da&s;hing off
with a &s;mile, Charming heroine! he called me. Then
after a &s;hort &s;ilence, Do you wi&s;h, Madam, &s;aid he,
that I &s;hould leave the hou&s;e, and at lea&s;t free you from
the &s;ight of a man who&s;e pre&s;ence &s;erves only to em|barra&s;s
you? I will, if you plea&s;e, endeavour al&s;o to
draw Sir George with me to town, that you may be
freed from the re&s;traint which now debars you of the
&s;ight of your happy lover. You are too, too good,
my lord, &s;aid I, and I am almo&s;t afraid to put your
<PB N="20" REF="195">
genero&s;ity to any farther proof. Ah, do not &s;pare me,
Madam, an&s;wered lord V&mdash;; after having lo&s;t
all hopes of your heart, my &s;ituation cannot be ren|dered
more unhappy by any additional mortification;
tell me what can I do, to &s;hew you how much I am
devoted to your &s;ervice? I premi&s;ed to your lord&s;hip,
&s;aid I, that if I had not the highe&s;t opinion imagina|ble
of you, I had not dared to proceed as I have done;
but I confide wholly in you, and am now going to de|mand
an important proof of that regard which you
profe&s;s for me.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, de&s;pairing of the con&s;ent of my
friends, urges me to marry him privately before his
departure. I received a letter from him ye&s;terday to
this effect, wherein he &s;ays, 'tis the only means to &s;e|cure
his future happine&s;s, and make him ea&s;y under
our &s;eparation. I have promi&s;ed to be his; yet can|not
per&s;uade my&s;elf to take &s;uch a &s;tep without fir&s;t
endeavouring, if po&s;&s;ible, to move my mama, at
lea&s;t, in his favour. She loves him dearly, and is of
&s;o tender and yielding a di&s;po&s;ition, that, were it not
through fear of my uncle's re&s;entment, I &s;hould, be|fore
this time, have ventured to di&s;clo&s;e my &s;ecret to
her. Yet I own, now that matters have gone &s;o far, I
have not the courage to do &s;o. Will you, my lord,
be my advocate on this occa&s;ion? Your example, your
influence, mu&s;t have great weight both with her and
my uncle. I believe your lord&s;hip knows that I have
a fortune not incon&s;iderable in my own power: 'tis
not then with any intere&s;ted view that I would wi&s;h to
obtain their con&s;ent, but to &s;pare my family the pain
they mu&s;t feel for having driven me to an act of di&s;|obedience,
and my&s;elf the grief of being divided from
relations I love &s;o tenderly. Do you then, madam,
&s;aid my lord, ri&s;ing off his chair with &s;ome emotion,
mean to go abroad with Mr. Falkland? Oh, by no
means, an&s;wered I; I de&s;ire no more than to quiet
Mr. Falkland's fears, who dreads the thoughts of leav|ing
me in my uncle's di&s;po&s;al. May I my lord, may
I expect the favour I have demanded of you? You
<PB N="21" REF="196">
have impo&s;ed a hard ta&s;k on me, madam, an&s;wered
lord V&mdash;. Is it that you think I have but a fee|ble
pa&s;&s;ion for you? or that you believe I am void of
&s;en&s;ibility? Neither the one nor the other, &s;aid I; I
believe you love me &s;incerely, and I am &s;ure there
exi&s;ts not a more noble or feeling heart! Tho&s;e are
the very rea&s;ons which determined me to make the re|que&s;t
to you. I would not have a&s;ked a man of an
ordinary &s;oul; &s;uch trials are not for common minds:
but you, my lord, I know, are equal to them. Will
you then, will you give me this la&s;t generous proof of
your love? Madam, I <HI>will,</HI> &s;aid my lord; you &s;hall
&s;ee, by this effort to oblige you, what I am capable of
doing for your happine&s;s&mdash;What, indeed, would I
<HI>not</HI> do! He pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words in a tone
that made me think he was almo&s;t moved to tears.
I felt my eyes moi&s;t&mdash;I will not thank you, my lord:
where a favour is <HI>above</HI> acknowlegement, words are
of no u&s;e. I do not de&s;pair, &s;aid he, (recovering
him&s;elf) of working on the ductile heart of Mrs.
Arnold; but for Sir George Bidulph, I &s;carce know
how to make the attempt; yet I will venture on
it for your &s;ervice.&mdash;What is <HI>his</HI> intere&s;t, what
are <HI>his</HI> feelings, what <HI>his</HI> lo&s;s, in compari&s;on to <HI>mine!</HI>
My lord cla&s;ped his hands together in uttering this la&s;t
word, fixing his eyes on me at the &s;ame time with
&s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;adne&s;s as wounded me to the
very heart. I was obliged to turn from him to hide
my tears. I beg your pardon, Madam, &s;aid he, I
meant not to move your pity, or to in&s;pire you with
any regret for <HI>my</HI> fate; forgive the la&s;t tran&s;ports of a
pa&s;&s;ion which has already cau&s;ed you but too much
unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Ah, my dear, is not this an exalted
man? Why were we not born for each other!</P>
<P>I have a thought come into my head, &s;aid my lord,
which I beg you will let me pur&s;ue my own way. Sir
George Bidulph and I am engaged to dine to-day with
Doctor T. one of the heads of the univer&s;ity; but I
will make &s;ome pretence for not attending him, be|cau&s;e
I &s;hould like to take this opportunity of having
<PB N="22" REF="197">
&s;ome conver&s;ation with Mr. Falkland. Will you, Ma|dam,
&s;end him a line to reque&s;t his company here at
five o'clock this afternoon? you may &s;ay I wi&s;h to talk
to him; but I be&s;eech you not to hint any thing more
&mdash;A&s;k me not, added he, how I mean to proceed; I
will not tell you my plot, though you your&s;elf &s;hall be
an actor in the dram$. I told him I &s;hould leave the
conduct of the &s;cene entirely to his lord&s;hip, and
&s;hould not make any enquiries into his de&s;ign. I then
&s;aid I believed it was almo&s;t my mama's hour of ri&s;ing,
and would therefore detain him no longer. He imme|diately
withdrew, and I &s;lipped up to my chamber by
the back &s;tairs, and writ a few lines to Mr. Falkland
ju&s;t in the terms my lord pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Orlando had &s;ent me word in his letter of ye&s;terday,
that he would &s;ee me this very morning: for though
he has not made his appearance at our hou&s;e &s;ince
my lord V&mdash;has been our gue&s;t; we neverthe|le&s;s
&s;ometimes &s;teal half an hour's conver&s;ation in my
ivy-bower, as I call it: you know he can enter it with|out
being &s;een, by means of the little door that leads
into the field, to which he has got a key. I expect|ed
him therefore, I &s;ay, this morning; but I was
de&s;irous of preventing his vi&s;it, that I might not be
under a nece&s;&s;ity of making any previous explanations,
as my lord had reque&s;ted that I &s;hould not. Having
di&s;patched my note, I &s;at my&s;elf down to give you
this account. I &s;hall break off here, and &s;hall re a&s;|&s;ume
my pen in the evening, to tell you the re&s;ult of
my lord's intended mea&s;ures.&mdash;<HI>What</HI> will they
produce! I have a thou&s;and worlds at &s;take! Oh, &s;i&s;|ter,
&s;i&s;ter, how my heart beats with apprehen&s;ion!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ten o'clock at night.</P>
<Q><L>Oh, day the faire&s;t &s;ure that ever ro&s;e,</L>
<L>Go, wing'd with plea&s;ure take thy happy flight,</L>
<L>And give each future morn a tincture of thy white!</L></Q>
<P><PB N="23" REF="198">
Ha, &s;aid I not well, my dear, that my lord V&mdash;
was the noble&s;t of men? Oh, Dolly, what tran&s;ports
would it give me to &s;ee <HI>you</HI> the happy wife of that
worthy lord! You think me mad, and, to &s;ay the
truth, I am a little be&s;ide my&s;elf, things have taken &s;o
&s;trange, &s;o unexpected, &s;o charming a turn! To put
an end to your &s;u&s;pence at once, and to give you a
&s;atisfaction equal almo&s;t to my own, know that Falk|land,
<HI>your</HI>'s and <HI>my</HI> beloved Falkland, is at length per|mitted
to call me <HI>his!</HI> But take, according to my ma|ma's
method, every thing in order as it happened;
there is not a circum&s;tance but what is worthy to be
writ in letters of gold.</P>
<P>My uncle, agreeably to his engagement, went to
dine with Doctor T. my lord V&mdash;feigned him|&s;elf
a little indi&s;po&s;ed, and &s;ent an apology. Mr. Falk|land,
in con&s;equence of my &s;ummons, came preci&s;ely
at five o'clock. My lord V&mdash;had ordered one of the
&s;ervants to wait his arrival at the gate, and to conduct
him directly to my dre&s;&s;ing-room, where he had pre|viou&s;ly
de&s;ired me to be in readine&s;s to receive him. I
re&s;olved implicitly to follow his in&s;tructions, and was
there accordingly when Mr. Falkland was &s;hewn into
the room. He &s;uppo&s;ed this was done by my private
directions; and as there was nothing extraordinary in
my lord V&mdash;'s de&s;iring to &s;ee him at this particular
juncture, he was not &s;urprized at it. He had been
informed by my note that my uncle was not to be at
home, and concluded we had taken that opportunity
to &s;end for him. He naturally imagined that lord V&mdash;
would not think of entertaining him in my apartment,
and expecting to be called away into another as &s;oon
as his lord&s;hip &s;hould hear of his being come, he re|&s;olved
to &s;pend the few minutes he &s;uppo&s;ed he had to
be alone with me on the &s;ubject which was neare&s;t his
heart; &s;o that entering at once into it, without a&s;king
any que&s;tions relative to lord V&mdash;, he began to urge
me with extreme earne&s;tne&s;s to con&s;ent to the having
our hands joined before his departure; but finding me
wore reluctant than ever to his propo&s;al, he fell on his
<PB N="24" REF="199">
knees before me, and was employing all the rhetoric
of a lover to per&s;uade me, when we were &s;urprized
by the &s;udden appearance of my mama and lord V&mdash;
who entered the room together.</P>
<P>I will not &s;peak of my, <HI>own</HI> confu&s;ion at this &s;ight;
great as it was, it was nothing in compari&s;on to that of
Falkland. As I had already paved the way for my
mama's coming to the knowlege of our &s;ecret, I was
prepared for the di&s;covery, though I little expected my
lord would have made it in this manner; but for poor
Orlando it was a thunder-clap that he could not &s;up|port.
How I felt for him in that minute! and &s;ecret|ly
reproached my&s;elf for not having given him &s;ome
little notice of the &s;tep I had taken. My mama &s;tart|ed
back as &s;he entered, for &s;he &s;aw him on his knees
holding one of my hands. She leaned with her back
again&s;t the wain&s;cot, and without being able to &s;peak,
look'd at us by turns; but with more, I thought, of
&s;orrow than &s;urprize in her countenance. Mr. Falk|land,
his face covered with a deep blu&s;h, hung down
his head, and as if overwhelmed with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;ome unpardonable crime, &s;eemed afraid to lift up
his eyes to my mama. How <HI>I</HI> looked I don't know,
but I &s;uppo&s;e very like a fool. My lord V&mdash;had
the only unembarra&s;&s;ed face among&s;t us. He, how|ever,
kept &s;ilence, and, I thought, for a while ap|peared
to enjoy the confu&s;ion into which he had
thrown us all. At length approaching Mr. Falkland,
he took him by the hand, and with an ingenuous free|dom,
Recover your&s;elf, Sir, &s;aid he, and do not be
a&s;hamed to own a pa&s;&s;ion for an object &s;o worthy of
your love as Mi&s;s Cecilia Arnold; and you, Ma|dam,
(turning towards me) have no rea&s;on to blu&s;h
for returning the tenderne&s;s of this amiable young
man. I no longer complain of your indifference for
me, the cau&s;e too well ju&s;tifies your &s;entiments; and
I &s;hould be the mo&s;t unju&s;t as well as unrea&s;onable
of men, if I did not at once yield up all preten&s;ions to
a heart, who&s;e prior engagements, as they forbid all
<PB N="25" REF="200">
hope on my part, &s;o do they deprive me of any pre|tence
for complaining.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, encouraged by my lord's friendly and
generous declaration, now ventured to look up. My
lord, &s;aid he, I am too much confounded to return you
the acknowlegements that I ought.&mdash;There is
&s;omething in your conduct that amazes!&mdash;that
almo&s;t dazzles me!&mdash;forgive me, my lord, my
confu&s;ion will not &s;uffer me to expre&s;s what I feel.&mdash;Then
drawing near my mama, he flung him&s;elf at her
feet. But can <HI>you,</HI> Madam, &s;aid he, can <HI>yon</HI> forgive
the pre&s;umptuous wretch, who, forgetting the thou&s;and
obligations he has to you, and the di&s;tance that fortune
has thrown between us, has dared to lift his eyes up
to your Cecilia? I thought this was my time to &s;peak,
and following Mr. Falkland's example, I threw my&s;elf
&s;uddenly at my mama's knees, which I embraced;
And can you, mama, &s;aid I, pardon the ungrateful girl,
who, &s;pite of her duty and the love &s;he bears you,
has ventured to be&s;tow her heart without your know|lege?
Good God! cried my mama, cro&s;&s;ing her arms
upon her brea&s;t, whil&s;t we both hung upon her, <HI>What</HI>
is this that you acknowlege! I <HI>can</HI> not puni&s;h you; and
I <HI>ought</HI> not to pardon you&mdash;Pray, my lord, help me to
di&s;engage my&s;elf from the&s;e unfortunate children.&mdash;
And why di&s;engage your&s;elf, Madam? an&s;wered my
lord; why will not you rather &s;uffer your&s;elf to be
touched with compa&s;&s;ion? What recompence can you
make your child for dividing her from the only man
&s;he can love? And what will avail all your maternal
care of this young man's infancy, all your kind atten|tion
to his education, and your concern for his future
welfare, if the &s;ame hand which has &s;o long cheri&s;hed
and pre&s;erved him, now da&s;hing with bitterne&s;s all your
benefits, wounds him where the heart mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly
feels, bla&s;ts all his hopes, and con&s;igns, perhaps, his
promi&s;ing youth to de&s;pair? Ah, Madam, you can|not
have the heart to do it&mdash;let your children's tears
prevail; let my entreaties, who &s;acrifice an intere&s;t
<HI>much</HI> dearer than a parent's; let your own tenderne&s;s,
a mother's tenderne&s;s &s;peak in their favour.&mdash;My
<PB N="26" REF="201">
lord might have continued his &s;upplications, if his own
emotions would have &s;uffered him; for we were none
of us in a condition to interrupt him. Mr. Falkland
and I were drowned in tears; my dear mama's eyes
ran like two fountains, yet &s;he made an effort to break
from us; but we both clung about her feet. Do not
leave me, mama! I &s;obbed out.&mdash;Have pity on me,
Madam! was all Mr. Falkland could utter.&mdash;Have
pity on <HI>me,</HI> my poor mama cried out, and do not tear
my heart thus between you!&mdash;Ju&s;t as &s;he &s;poke the&s;e
words, my uncle Bidulph and Mr. Price pre&s;ented
them&s;elves at the door.&mdash;(Their &s;udden appearance
looked like enchantment; but I'll tell you by and by
how it came about.) What can all this mean? cried
my uncle, as he entered the room: then &s;topping &s;hort,
My lord V&mdash;! has any misfortune happened in the fa|mily
&s;ince I left you this morning? There has, &s;aid my
mama; I leave it to my lord to explain to you what it
is. I know of none, an&s;wered my lord V&mdash;, but
what is in your power, Madam, and that of Sir George
Bidulph to turn into a ble&s;&s;ing. Then addre&s;&s;ing my
uncle, Look at this pair pro&s;trate before you, Sir
George, &s;aid he, look at them, and gue&s;s the re&s;t. It
&s;hould &s;eem, replied my uncle, as if this young lady
and gentleman were &s;olliciting Mrs. Arnold's con&s;ent
to their marriage; yet I cannot think it po&s;&s;ible that
my niece &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to duty and di&s;cretion, or
that Mr. Falkland has &s;o far forgot him&s;elf&mdash;Mr.
Falkland &s;tarted up from his knees, piqued with re|&s;entment
at the &s;everity of my uncle's expre&s;&s;ion, and
turning to him with a &s;pirited air, though not without
re&s;pect, No, Sir George, &s;aid he, Falkland has not
forgot him&s;elf, he remembers the obligations <HI>above</HI> re|compence
that he has to the be&s;t of women, (point|ing
to my mama) he remembers that he is an unhappy
orphan without a friend to own him, he remembers too
well the misfortune of his birth, and he knows too
that if it had not been for Mrs. Arnold's pious care,
his mind might have been deba&s;ed as low as is his for|tune,
which now expo&s;es him to the contempt with
which he is treated. Yet con&s;cious as he his of all this,
<PB N="27" REF="202">
he has dared to love your niece, nay, to own it, and
is even bold enough to &s;ollicit Mrs. Arnold for her
con&s;ent to his happine&s;s; for under all the&s;e mortify|ing
di&s;advantages, he remembers that he owes his birth
to a man who&s;e &s;on (had it not been for the fatal blow
that robbed <HI>you</HI> of his valuable life) would have re|flected
honour, not di&s;grace, on the family to whom
he &s;hould have allied him&s;elf.</P>
<P>My uncle &s;eemed &s;truck at Mr. Falkland's re&s;olute
reply; I &s;ee, &s;aid he, you have inherited at lea&s;t &s;ome
&s;hare of your father's <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> I have addre&s;&s;ed you.
Sir, an&s;wered Mr. Falkland, as a man, as my equal,
and one to whom I owe no obligation upon that &s;core.
I hope I have not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds which de|cency
and good manners pre&s;cribe; but when I con|&s;ider
you as the uncle of Cecilia, the brother of Mrs.
Arnold, and <HI>once</HI> the dear friend of my poor father, I
again re-a&s;&s;ume my &s;uppliant po&s;ture (falling on his
knees and &s;eizing my uncle's hand:) Oh, Sir George,
<HI>can</HI> you treat with inhumanity the &s;on of Falkland?
My mama wept aloud, my lord V&mdash;&s;eemed with dif|ficulty
to refrain from tears; for my part, I was quite
di&s;&s;olved, and the good old Price blew his no&s;e two or
three times; my uncle him&s;elf appeared a good deal
moved. My lord V&mdash;, &s;aid he, it was not kind in
you to lead me into &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ituation as this.
I own I am quite at a lo&s;s to account for your lord|&s;hip's
conduct on this occa&s;ion. Account for it, an|&s;wered
my lord, from motives of compan&s;&s;ion, from
that pity which I &s;ee at this minute working in your
own brea&s;t, I &s;hall explain my&s;elf at large to you
hereafter, mean while I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure <HI>you,</HI> that you have
been drawn into this affecting &s;cene entirely without
the participation either of Mi&s;s Cecilia or Mr. Falkland,
and Mrs. Arnold has been equally &s;urprized into it with
your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let me beg of you, Sir, to ri&s;e, &s;aid my uncle, to
Mr. Falkland. He did &s;o. I am forced, continued
Sir George, into a very di&s;agreeable &s;hare in this
eclai$ci&s;&s;ement; I am heartily &s;orry, I ever interfered
in the di&s;po&s;al of Mi&s;s Cecilia; but I thought I was
<PB N="28" REF="203">
acquitting my&s;elf of a duty, and at the &s;ame time that
I was not rendering an unacceptable &s;ervice to your
lord&s;hip. The happine&s;s that you would have con|ferred
on me, an&s;wered lord V&mdash;, I &s;hall acknowlege
with the highe&s;t gratitude whil&s;t I live, and I call to
witne&s;s him, who made and who knows the &s;ecrets
of our hearts, that if I could have obtained that of
your niece, I would not have given up my intere&s;t in
her for any thing this world contains; but, Sir George,
the lady <HI>her&s;elf</HI> acknowleged to me her love for Mr.
Falkland; after that confe&s;&s;ion, what proof could I
give her of the &s;incerity of my attachment to her,
but to endeavour, as far as was in my power, to pro|mote
her happine&s;s? It re&s;ts not on me, my lord, &s;aid my
uncle, coldly, to facilitate or retard her happine&s;s, as you
are plea&s;ed to call it; I fancy the young lady is almo&s;t her
own mi&s;tre&s;s, for I pre&s;ume my &s;i&s;ter has half con&s;ented
already. You wrong me, Sir George, an&s;wered my ma|ma;
I appeal to my lord V. and to the&s;e children them|&s;elves,
if I have in the lea&s;t yielded. However I may
be touched by this unhappy event, I owe you that de|ference,
brother, that I here declare I never will give
my con&s;ent to an union that has not your approbation.
My uncle was going to reply; I was afraid he would
by a deci&s;ive negative put an end to all our hopes, and
I was re&s;olved to prevent him. Hold, dear uncle,
&s;aid I, and before you determine our fate, &s;uffer me at
lea&s;t to exculpate my&s;elf from the charge of di&s;obedi|ence.
I own I love Mr. Falkland; <HI>That,</HI> if it <HI>be</HI> a
fault, as it was an involuntary one, has not infringed
the laws of duty. I was taught from my earlie&s;t
childhood to con&s;ider him upon a footing of equality;
I loved him from the example of tho&s;e whom I
thought it a merit to imitate. I knew my fortune en|titled
me to a richer match; yet I knew at the &s;ame
time it gave me a privilege that I valued above riches.
I need not here, Sir, repeat the words of Mr. Warner's
will<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Warner had in a preamble to that part of his will which related to his two young kin&s;women, made u&s;e of the following words:</P>
<P>&startq;And forafmuch as parents, guardians, and relations, do &s;ome|times from mere caprice, or a greedine&s;s of wealth, withhol$ their con&s;ents to marriages on which the happine&s;s of their childrens lives depends; I do hereby give and bequeath to my two kin&s;women Dorathea and Cecilia Arnold, the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds each, to be at their own full and free di&s;po&s;al at the age of eighteen years, relying on their prudence and the goodne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;itions; to the end that they may not (as their mother was) be compelled through fear to accept of a man they do not like.&endq;</P>
<P>The la&s;t act of Mr. Warner's was very confident with the cha|racter of that whim&s;ical, though very worthy man.</P></NOTE>. Yet I have not, I mean not to avail my&s;elf of
<PB N="29" REF="204">
the power that has given me; I will not abu&s;e the
good opinion Mr. Warner had of me, nor the confi|dence
with which my mama has ever been plea&s;ed to
favour me. I would fain owe my happine&s;s to your
indulgence, Sir, and that of the be&s;t of mothers. I
have not be&s;towed my affections unworthily; Mr.
Falkland's family is &s;uperior to my own, his education,
his accompli&s;hments, his mind, all are worthy, of his
brith. You <HI>may</HI> forbid me to be his; but I never
will be the wife of any other man. For Heaven's &s;ake,
my dear Sir George, &s;aid my lord V&mdash;, con&s;ider a
little of the merit or your niece's conduct; has &s;he it
not in her power to marry Mr. Falkland, and to be|&s;tow
her fortune on him? where will you find a young
creature tenderly attached as &s;he acknowleges her&s;elf
to be, who would forego &s;uch a privilege, and &s;acri|fice
her own happine&s;s to gratify a mere punctilio?&mdash;
Her mother did &s;o, interrupted my uncle. And how
often, Sir, (as I have heard my mama &s;ay) did you
reproach her for that? an&s;wered I; and what pains
did you not take to per&s;uade her to &s;tick to her fir&s;t
engagements? The ca&s;es are very different, &s;aid my
uncle; Mr. Falkland was a match of which the fir&s;t
woman in the kingdom might have been proud to ac|cept:
I mean not to depreciate this young man; but
I mu&s;t &s;ay, the per&s;onal merit, the character, the for|tune
of his father&mdash;Oh, Sir, cried Mr. Falkland, I
know how much he was &s;uperior to me in every thing;
yet there was a time when you &s;aw him &s;tripped of his
fortune, his character &s;tained by a dreadful event, rob|bed
<PB N="30" REF="205">
almo&s;t of his rea&s;on, and obliged to abandon his
family and his country; yet even then, under tho&s;e
circum&s;tances of complicated mi&s;ery, you thought him
worthy of your &s;i&s;ter, the be&s;t and the lovelie&s;t of
women; how can you then, Sir, reject$ the unhappy
&s;on of him you once preferred to all mankind? I re|member
the day &s;aid poor Mr. Price, (who&s;e voice al|ready
faltering with age, was rendered &s;till more un|&s;teady
from the emotions of his mind) I remember the
day when I joined that lady's hand to Mr. Falkland's.
He was then &s;uch a fine young man as my pupil is
now, and Mrs. Arnold was &s;uch a beauty as her daugh|ter
Cecilia; you, Sir George, with your own hand
gave the bride, and joyful you were to be&s;tow her on
your noble friend: I did not think I &s;hould have lived
to &s;ee the hour, when a child of his would be de&s;pi&s;ed
and &s;purn'd from your family! The good old man
melted into tears as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>So! &s;aid my uncle, I find you have got Mr. Price
of your &s;ide as well as my lord V&mdash;he affected to
&s;ay this carele&s;ly, but I &s;aw he was moved. I ventur|ed
to cla&s;p my arms round him, All the afflictions of
my dear mama's life, &s;aid I, and the cruel misfortunes
of poor Mr. Falkland's, were owing to the mi&s;taken
zeal of my grand-mama Bidulph for her daughter's
happine&s;s; will <HI>you,</HI> Sir, pur&s;ue a conduct that you
have often &s;o ju&s;tly cen&s;ured? will <HI>you</HI> imitate that
&s;tubborn authority that you have &s;o often condemned?
and will <HI>you,</HI> in the per&s;on of that friendle&s;s young
man, perpetuate the mi&s;eries of his father whom you
have &s;o o$ten deplored?</P>
<P>What is it that you would have me do? &s;aid my
uncle, gently di&s;engaging him&s;elf from my hold. You
do not &s;eem to con&s;ider <HI>my</HI> character: what a figure
&s;hould I make in life, if after being known (for the
thing can be no &s;ecret) that I was in treaty with lord
V&mdash;, I &s;hould all of a &s;udden break off, and con&s;ent
to a marriage where the di&s;parity is &s;o obvious? Me|thinks
you &s;hould in the mid&s;t of your pa&s;&s;ion have
&s;ome regard to your reputation; for matches of this
kind are rarely concluded with the con&s;ent of parents,
<PB N="31" REF="206">
but where there are rea&s;ons to which, for the lady's
&s;ake, her friends are obliged to yield. That is by no
means a nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion, Sir George, an&s;wered
my lord V&mdash;, nor is the world &s;o &s;evere in its cen&s;ures
as not to &s;uppo&s;e that parents may &s;ometimes have ten|derne&s;s
enough to &s;acrifice their own wi&s;hes, however
laudable, to the more immediate happine&s;s of their
children; nor will any one be in the lea&s;t &s;urprized,
that two amiable young people, bred up together,
&s;hould have a preference for each other, without draw|ing
any inferences unfavourable to either &s;ide. Do
you hear that, Madam? &s;aid my uncle to my mama.
Oh, &s;i&s;ter, you may blame your&s;elf for all this! I do,
I do, cried my mama, I acknowlege my error, I feel
the puni&s;hment; but it is now pa&s;t remedy. Brother,
added &s;he, I yield up Cecilia to your di&s;po&s;al; had
you been able to accompli&s;h an alliance with lord V&mdash;,
my joyful con&s;ent would have gone along with it;
&s;ince we are di&s;appointed in that, I can only &s;ay, that
let your determination be what it will, my concurrence
&s;hall go hand in hand with it. A very pretty way, &s;aid
my uncle, &s;miling, of &s;lipping your neck out of the
collar: Ah, Sidney, I gue&s;s to which &s;ide of the que&s;|tion
your approbation would willingly attach it&s;elf.
And &s;o do I too, &s;aid Mr. Price; I know Mrs. Ar|nold's
love for her children would incline her to with
their mutual happine&s;s. What is there lo&s;t by the ex|change,
&s;aid lord V&mdash;, but a worthle&s;s title on which
Mi&s;s Arnold would reflect more honour than &s;he could
receive from it? Mighty fine, mighty fine, &s;aid my
uncle. Well, ladies and gentlemen, you may act as
you think proper; but &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>I</HI> were to give up my
intere&s;t in this affair, how do you think to an&s;wer it to
lady Sarah? If you, Sir George, &s;aid my lord V&mdash;,
will, by determining your&s;elf in our favour, (how deli|cate
was that little word <HI>our!</HI>) permit Mrs. Arnold to
do &s;o too, <HI>I</HI> will engage to reconcile lady Sarah to our
proceedings. Will you? &s;aid my uncle: &s;aith, my
lord, then that is more than <HI>I</HI> would undertake to do:
but I grant your lord&s;hip's eloquence is very much &s;u|perior
to mine.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="207">
My uncle walked about the room, and appeared ir|re&s;olute
and unwilling to &s;peak. Let me conjure you,
Sir, to pronounce my &s;entence, cried Mr. Falkland,
for I &s;tand here in the condition of a criminal, who&s;e
life or death depends on the lips of his judge. Mercy!
mercy! in a tremulous voice, cried the venerable Price.
And forgivene&s;s, added I, again falling at my uncle's
knees. Come, Sir George, &s;aid my lord V&mdash;, I know
you will yield; le&s;&s;en not the grace by deferring it
too long. Well&mdash;&s;ince I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> yield&mdash;Mrs.
Arnold, you have my con&s;ent to act agreeably to your
own inclinations.&mdash;You &s;ee, Sir George could not
bring him&s;elf to yield with a good grace; but this was
enough: my mama &s;prung to me, and rai&s;ing me up,
Cecilia, &s;aid &s;he, I forgive you, and charge <HI>my&s;elf</HI> with
the error of your conduct; She then led me to Mr.
Falkland, and putting my hand into one of his, Take
her, Orlando, &s;aid &s;he, I give her to you for the love
I bore your father; I pray Heaven make your marriage
happier than&mdash;My mama could proceed no far|ther,
her voice was choaked by tears. Mr. Falkland
ki&s;&s;ed her hands upon his knees; then approaching my
uncle, he bent one knee to him in token of an acknow|legement
and duty. My uncle &s;tooped down his body
in a bowing po&s;ture; but without offering to rai&s;e him,
only &s;aid, Sir, I &s;incerely wi&s;h your happine&s;s. Mr.
Falkland then thanked my lord V&mdash;, and Mr. Price in
their turns, who both embraced and congratulated
him.</P>
<P>This affair being now determined, &s;aid my uncle, I
&s;hould be glad to know what Mr. Falkland means, to
do? I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that what has now pa&s;&s;ed ought
not to make any change in re&s;olutions with regard to
the army. I know of no profe&s;&s;ion to which he can
betake him&s;elf with &s;o much honour; and as it is that
to which he has been always de&s;tined, he would ap|pear
with a very ill grace at &s;uch a juncture as this,
when all the young men in the kingdom are eager to
expre&s;s their zeal for the &s;ervice of their country, if he
&s;hould now decline the opportunity which my lord
V&mdash;has given him to &s;hew him&s;elf at lea&s;t as forward
<PB N="33" REF="208">
as others. My lord V&mdash;was &s;ilent, yet it was very
ea&s;y to &s;ee by his countenance that he was of my un|cle's
opinion, for my lord V&mdash;, my dear, is a &s;oldier
from head to foot. As for my&s;elf, though I &s;ecretly
wi&s;hed Mr. Falkland had not embraced &s;o hazardous
a way of life, and already began to tremble at the
thoughts of his departure; yet after the bravery I had
&s;hewn in my conver&s;ation with lord V&mdash;on this &s;ub|ject,
I was a&s;hamed to make the lea&s;t objection. Mr.
Falkland, I believe, gue&s;&s;ed what pa&s;&s;ed in my mind.
There is, nothing, replied he, which is capable of mak|ing
me change, my re&s;olution, unle&s;s it be the will of
Mi&s;s Cecilia; if &s;he does not forbid it, I &s;hall e&s;teem
my&s;elf happy, if under the au&s;pices of my lord V&mdash;,
I am permitted to follow both my duty and my inclina|tion.
I know not whether Mr. Falkland was quite
&s;incere in making u&s;e of the <HI>la&s;t</HI> expre&s;&s;ion; but the
affair had been put to him in &s;uch a light by Sir George
that he could not well make any other reply. What
do <HI>you</HI> &s;ay, madam? &s;aid my lord V&mdash;, 1 was vexed
the que&s;tion came from <HI>him;</HI> I thought my&s;elf doubly
obliged to comply Far be it from me, my lord, &s;aid
I, (very &s;toutly) to ob&s;truct Mr. Falkland's road to
glory!</P>
<P>You do not in end then, I pre&s;ume, &s;aid my uncle,
to marry at this juncture? I &s;uppo&s;e Cecilia would not
chu&s;e to make a campaign? and I think, Mr. Falk|land,
after the a&s;&s;urances he has ju&s;t now received,
may venture his mi&s;tre&s;s in the hands of his friends till
his return, when he may appear in a &s;ort of rank in
life that will better ju&s;tify our con&s;enting to this mar|riage;
for after all, what a &s;trange appearance would
it have for a match to be clapt up &s;o &s;uddenly, for
&s;uch a girl as Mi&s;s Arnold with a lad in the univer&s;ity?
A little con&s;trained &s;mile which &s;hewed it&s;elf at once
on the face of lord V&mdash;, my mama, and even the &s;e|rious
good old Price, gave a kind of a tacit a&s;&s;ent to
my uncle's ob&s;ervation. There is one method, &s;aid
Mr. Falkland, to obviate this apparent impropriety;
our marriage may be kept concealed.&mdash;My uncle ob|jected
to this, and offered rea&s;ons unnece&s;&s;ary to be re|peated,
<PB N="34" REF="209">
and which I &s;hould have been much better
plea&s;ed he had not offered at all. Mr. Falkland was
earne&s;t in having the affair concluded his own way,
when my mama, afraid, I believe, of his offending
my uncle, interpo&s;ed; Let us con&s;ider of this another
time, &s;aid &s;he; it is a thing of too much con&s;equence
to be determined &s;o ha&s;tily. Then, with a de&s;ign to
turn the di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he a&s;ked my lord V&mdash;how he had
contrived matters &s;o, as to a&s;&s;emble the whole family
together at &s;o critical a juncture? Lord V&mdash;related as
much of the conver&s;ation I had with him this morning
as he thought nece&s;&s;ary to his purpo&s;e; kindly &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
that circum&s;tance of my having a&s;ked his me|diation;
but acknowleging at the &s;ame time, that from
the moment I had opened my heart to him, he had re|&s;olved
to do his utmo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. He &s;aid, that
having de&s;ired Mr. Falkland's company that evening
under colour of bu&s;ine&s;s, he had given private orders
to one of the &s;ervants to conduct him to my dre&s;&s;ing-room,
and in about a quarter of an hour after his ar|rival
to come in to the room where he was &s;itting with
my mama, to give him notice that Mr. Falkland was
come. I concluded by that time, &s;aid my lord, that
the lovers, might be engaged in an intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation;
and not doubting but our &s;udden appear|ance
would make an open for the &s;cene I meditated, I
very naturally reque&s;ted Mrs. Arnold to &s;tep with me
into the chamber, where I was told Mr. Falkland
waited for me. I led you, madam, as you know (pro|ceeded
he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to my mama) in a mo&s;t
favourable moment to your daughter's apartment. As
for Sir George, I believe he mu&s;t have been extremely
&s;urprized at receiving a note from me whil&s;t he was at
dinner at Doctor T&mdash;'s, to beg he would return home
as early in the evening as po&s;&s;ible, &s;omething of impor|tance
requiring his pre&s;ence. I had before-hand en|gaged
Mr. Price in his pupil's intere&s;ts, and obtained
from him a promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. By calculating hour,
I was certain Sir George would arrive here a &s;hort
time after Mr. Falkland, whom I had appointed to
come at five o'clock; I begged of Mr. Price to be in
<PB N="35" REF="210">
the way to receive him, and without letting him know
that Mr. Falkland was in the hou&s;e, to conduct Sir
George directly to us. This, madam, is the machine|ry
of which I have made u&s;e to bring about this un|expected
cata&s;trophe, and I draw &s;ome con&s;olation in
having at lea&s;t been in&s;trumental to Mi&s;s Cecilia's hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>I now gave Mr. Falkland a hint to retire, le&s;t he
&s;hould renew tho&s;e in&s;tances that I &s;aw were &s;o unac|ceptable
to my uncle. He took his leave after reitera|ted
acknowlegements to every one pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>My uncle was not in a very good humour for the re|mainder
of the evening, and often recurred to what
lady Sarah would &s;ay to this <HI>&s;trange</HI> event. He &s;aid he
would write to her in order to prepare her for it, be|fore
he would <HI>venture</HI> to acquaint her with it as a thing
on which we had concluded. So that, my dear, you
are not to mention a &s;yllable to her of what I have
now written to you. My mama was rather thought|ful;
yet I fancy at the bottom &s;he is not much di&s;plea&s;|ed.
Our dear good old man &s;eemed quite delighted;
and as for my lord V&mdash;, he behaved like an angel;
without arrogating to him&s;elf any merit for what he
had done, or appearing even con&s;cious of the gene|ro&s;ity
of his own conduct, he &s;hewed only that mode&s;t
and placid compo&s;ure which a good mind feels on hav|ing
acquitted it&s;elf of a duty.</P>
<P>My mama, with whom I had half an hour's conver|&s;ation
before &s;he retired to bed, demanded many parti|culars
of me relative to the attachment between Mr.
Falkland and me; to all her que&s;tions I an&s;wered
with great &s;incerity. She &s;aid, &s;he had been rather
too precipitate, and that &s;he owed you that mark of
re&s;pect as well as tenderne&s;s, to have made you ac|quainted
with the affair before it was decided: but
I ventured to an&s;wer for my deare&s;t Dolly, that &s;he
would be perfectly &s;atisfied with the determination.
My mama &s;aid &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Falkland would be
extremely urgent to have our marriage concluded be|fore
he left England; and that &s;he was &s;ure Sir George
would be aver&s;e to it: For my part, added &s;he, I &s;hall
<PB N="36" REF="211">
be neutral; &s;ince I <HI>have</HI> con&s;ented, I de&s;ire not to yield
my conce&s;&s;ion by halves. I a&s;&s;ured her I would much
rather the marriage were po&s;tponed till Mr. Falkland
returned home again, which I hoped, if Heaven &s;par|ed
his life, would be in le&s;s than a year. It then re&s;ts
upon you, child, &s;aid &s;he, to determine the matter one
way or other.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry my mama has in this in&s;tance given up her
authority over me, becau&s;e it is le&s;s in my power than
it would be in her's to oppo&s;e Mr. Falkland's entreaties;
yet I will on this occa&s;ion try what my influence over
him will effect. I am &s;ure it will be more grateful to
all parties, to have the bu&s;ine&s;s deferred, even to the
worthy lord V&mdash;him&s;elf; and I owe him at lea&s;t this
compliment.</P>
<P>After a day &s;pent in &s;o much anxiety, and concluded
with &s;o much agitation, I was very glad to get up into
my own chamber, and &s;it down quietly to fini&s;h my
letter to you, if &s;uch a volume can be called by that
name. I have &s;pent half the night in writing it, and
am glad I &s;hall have an opportunity of &s;ending it off to|morrow.
My mama tells me my uncle intends writing
to lady Sarah to-night, ju&s;t to make an opening, as he
calls it, of this mo&s;t <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing</HI> affair! The me&s;&s;enger
&s;ets off by day-break, and is to return again in the af|ternoon,
&s;o that I &s;hall hope for a line from you by
him.</P>
<P>I expect &s;ome violent rubs from lady Sarah, but they
will only grate the &s;kin a little; and &s;o long as I am
out of her reach, the &s;cratches will heal of them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>From you, my love, I look for congratulations; and
can only in return wi&s;h you as happy a lot as that of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 10th,</DATE>
eight o'clock in the evening.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<Q>[In this letter&punc; he gives his friend a brief account of
what had pa&s;&s;ed that evening at Mrs. Arnold's,
and then proceeds:]</Q>
<P>&mdash;Here's a revolution for you, Audley, beyond hope,
beyond imagination! What would I now give to recall a
few &s;hort months! But I will not &s;pend my time in
u&s;ele&s;s imprecations, either on your unlucky zeal, or
my own folly. I have but one hope now left to reme|dy
the pa&s;t evil, and that is a reliance on the meek
forgiving temper of Mi&s;s Arnold, joined to her fears of
acknowleging a fault, of which you &s;ay, and I believe
&s;he has, more than once, in &s;ecret repented. I know
her gentle nature will not &s;uffer her to think of re|venge.
To what purpo&s;e then, by an ill-timed avowal
of her own weakne&s;s, de&s;troy the happine&s;s of others,
without deriving from it any con&s;olation to her&s;elf?
You will &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed letter, which I have le&s;t
open on purpo&s;e for your peru&s;al, the arguments, or
rather the conjurations (for the ca&s;e will not admit of
many arguments,) of which I have made u&s;e, to pre|vail
with her to bury in eternal &s;ilence our ill-fated
amour.</P>
<P>The favour I have to entreat of you, Sir Edward,
is to get this letter put into her hands with the utmo&s;t
privacy, and all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. Her maid has been
the medium through which all my letters have lately
pa&s;&s;ed, and you may &s;afely confide it to her care.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in order to be before-hand with the family
of Woodberry, di&s;patch this by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger,
<PB N="38" REF="213">
who has orders not to &s;pare his hor&s;es; &s;o that I pre|&s;ume
this may ki&s;s your hands about your ordinary
hour of going to bed. I take it for granted, Cecilia
will not give her &s;i&s;ter a faithful narrative of this whole
affair; and that lady Sarah will al&s;o receive advice of
it from Sir George; but if you are punctual&punc; I mu&s;t
anticipate them all; for my letter may ea&s;ily &s;alute
poor Dolly Arnold's upri&s;ing to morrow, and the deuce
is in it if any intelligence from them can reach her be|fore
mid-day at &s;oone&s;t, or perhaps not till Wedne&s;|day;
for not having the &s;ame rea&s;ons to urge their ex|pedition
that I have, they may probably make u&s;e of
the ordinary conveyance of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>My heart would fain deliver it&s;elf up to extacy, yet
dare not do it. Oh, Audley, if Mi&s;s Arnold &s;hould
forgive, as well as relea&s;e me of my promi&s;e! in that
ca&s;e I &s;hould only de&s;ire you to pray (if you ever per|form
&s;uch a ceremony) that I might not run mad for
joy. As for your &s;chemes with regard to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
your&s;elf of this girl, I would recommend it to you to
lay them a&s;ide, for I think it will be a vain attempt.
If hereafter I &s;hall &s;ee the &s;malle&s;t open for your &s;uc|ceeding
with her, be &s;ure, Audley, you will find in me
a zealous friend.</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Mi&s;s ARNOLD.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 10th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am unworthy of your &s;malle&s;t regard, madam.&mdash;
I hate my&s;elf, and de&s;erved to be abhorred by all
the world; but more particularly by you who&s;e confi|dence
I have betrayed, and who&s;e e&s;teem I have re|paid
with ingratitude. You have long perceived, and
<PB N="39" REF="214">
&s;ometimes (though I own but too tenderly) reproach|ed
me with my growing coldne&s;s. Con&s;cious as I was
of my guilt, I had not the courage to acknowledge it;
but endeavoured by mean arts to palliate a crime, which
I could not expiate. But let me tear off the treacher|ous
veil, and expo&s;e at once to your eyes this vile of|fender!
this <HI>pretended</HI> admirer of Mi&s;s Arnold; but
the <HI>real lover</HI> of her &s;i&s;ter. Yes, madam, I own I
love Cecilia. My pa&s;&s;ion for her took root before my
heart was capable of deceit; and the fir&s;t treachery of
which I was guilty was in offering tho&s;e vows to you,
which I had &s;ecretly dedicated to her. Our mutual
misfortune has ari&s;en from my coming at the knowlege
(by means of my too officious friend Sir Edward Aud|ley)
of tho&s;e favourable &s;entiments with which you
honoured me, at a time when I was &s;o far from in|dulging
my&s;elf with a hope that I had touched Ce|cilia's
heart, that I pre&s;umed not to entertain the mo&s;t
di&s;tant thought of being beloved either by you or her.
And I called Heaven to witne&s;s that I did my utmo&s;t
to guard my heart again&s;t a pro&s;pect &s;o &s;educing, &s;o
full of charms.</P>
<P>You may remember, madam, it was long before I
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf; that
by a fatal concurrence of circum&s;tances, my evil ge|nius
impelled me to offer you a heart which was not
mine to give; but I &s;oon found my error, and. the di&s;|covery
was followed by the deepe&s;t regrets for having
deceived a woman who&s;e merit rendered her &s;o worthy
of a better lot. Accu&s;e me of fal&s;hood, of infidelity,
and, if you plea&s;e, of the blacke&s;t di&s;&s;imulation; I
merit it all; but charge me not with incon&s;tancy, for
light as that cen&s;ure is in compari&s;on of my other
crimes, 'tis the only one of which I can exculpate my|&s;elf.
My love for Cecilia was but for a while &s;u&s;pend|ed,
it never was extingui&s;hed; and the fir&s;t moment
in which I &s;aw her, after our fatal engagements, it
blazed out again with redoubled force. I will leave
it to her, madam, to tell you what has been its pro|gre&s;s
&s;ince; and will ha&s;ten to that point where every
hope, and every wi&s;h, where, in one word, my &s;oul
<PB N="40" REF="215">
is centered. Your &s;i&s;ter has conde&s;cended to honour
me with her hand; your mama (mine too let me call
her) touched with compa&s;&s;ion, has been prevailed on to
yield it to me; and even Sir George Bidulph has at
length &s;uffered him&s;elf to grant a reluctant con&s;ent.
Your friends will them&s;elves &s;oon inform you of every
particular. But can I, dare I pre&s;ume to urge the in|jured
lady, whom I have &s;o highly offended, to concur
with her family in making happy the unde&s;erving
wretch, who &s;o ju&s;tly merits her utmo&s;t indignation?
Yes, my amiable and re&s;pected friend, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> conjure
you; the de&s;pairing Falkland throws him&s;elf at your
feet covered with &s;hame and remor&s;e. His life is in
your hand, the life of him you once loved, and who
but for a fatality which he could not overrule, would
have made it the &s;tudy, the pride of that life to have
de&s;erved your love. Think that the peace of your
whole family is interwoven with mine; think, &s;hould
our unfortunate engagements be known, what might
be the con&s;equence of Sir George Bidulph's ju&s;tly pro|voked
indignation, of your revered mama's but too
well founded &s;orrow, of your dear Cecilia's grief and
di&s;appointment; and if you don't yet hate me, think
of my pangs, and remember my unhappy father's
fate! Think what will it avail you to divulge a crime,
of which, though I feel the horrors, I cannot repent?</P>
<P>You are too good, too compa&s;&s;ionate to puni&s;h a
weakne&s;s, to which I have been driven by an irre&s;i&s;tible
impul&s;e; 'tis in your power to make me the happie&s;t
or the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men. Let me be&s;eech you,
madam, not to con&s;ult on this occa&s;ion the dictates of
your re&s;entment; but let the daughter of <HI>Mrs. Arnold</HI>
imitate her mother's admirable example, who more than
once yielded up her own deare&s;t intere&s;ts to promote
the good of others, contenting her&s;elf with the &s;ilent
applau&s;e of her own noble mind. Write to me, I con|jure
you, pour out your indignation on me; but con|clude
with a line of comfort, and ju&s;t &s;ay, &startq;Falkland,
I bury your tre&s;pa&s;s in oblivion.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
Tue&s;day, five o'clock in the morning.</OPENER>
<P>THE &s;peed of your courier has an&s;wered the
keenne&s;s of your wi&s;hes. I found the poor be|numb'd
devil waiting for me when I came in from the
tavern where I had &s;upped. And &s;o you think I am
to di&s;patch your letter to Mi&s;s Arnold, return you by
the bearer an ab&s;olution &s;igned by her in form, congra|tulate
you on your approaching felicity, and &s;it down
contented with <HI>your pity</HI> on the lo&s;s of my hopes?
Why, what a &s;ot art thou, Falkland, to fancy I can
look with patience at thy victory, and at the &s;ame time
&s;ee all my own expectations bla&s;ted! A notable com|pliment
you have paid me truly, in yielding up to me
your preten&s;ions to a woman whom you do not love;
but without making one effort to promote the accom|pli&s;hment
of my wi&s;hes. Is this your friend&s;hip? this
the zeal that I expected from you? Selfi&s;h as thou
art, thou hugge&s;t thy&s;elf in thy own pro&s;perity, and
leave&s;t thy friend to the gaping ruin that &s;urrounds and
is ready to &s;wallow him up, without even &s;tretching,
thy hand to draw him forth! But I will be plain with
you at once, Falkland; I will not &s;end your letter to
Mi&s;s Arnold; an opportunity now offers to put me in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, which at the &s;ame time that it re|deems
me from de&s;truction, will more effectually &s;ecure
you again&s;t a di&s;covery than all the whining epi&s;tles
you could &s;cribble to her from this till dooms-day.
You think the affair impracticable, brainle&s;s fellow as
thou art, why 'tis as ea&s;y as lying; and thus will I
effect it:</P>
<P>Write me a &s;hort billet to Mi&s;s Arnold; tell her
that, &startq;having &s;omething of the la&s;t con&s;equence to
<PB N="42" REF="217">
communicate to her, you are come to town on pur|po&s;e
to have a per&s;onal conference with her. That
to avoid being &s;een in London for particular rea&s;ons&punc;
you have repaired privately to that hou&s;e at Brump|ton&endq;
(where you may rememher my mother had
lodgings the beginning of the winter when Harry had
the chin-cough). In&s;i&s;t on her meeting you there;
you may &s;ay, to give it a better colour, that you have
no objection to my &s;i&s;ter's being pre&s;ent at the confe|rence,
(by the bye, both my mother and &s;i&s;ter are now
on a vi&s;it to our cou&s;in Bateman at Hampton-court):
inclo&s;e this letter to me. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf &s;he comes
at all events, 'tis a matter of duty, putting love out of
the que&s;tion. The hou&s;e you know &s;tands alone in the
middle of a garden; what a charming cage to enclo&s;e
&s;o pretty a &s;inging bird! The daughter of the woman
who keeps it is a very good girl, and my particular
friend; 'twas I who recommended the lodgings to my
mother, as I now and then &s;leep there a night or &s;o for
the benefit of the air. And now, Falkland, that you
may not have any qualms upon you, take my mo&s;t
&s;olemn oath, which I never violate to <HI>man,</HI> that I
will not injure the fair one. Mi&s;s Arnold is not a
Theodora Williams, &s;he was not born to be the mi&s;|tre&s;s
of any one; but I think &s;he will make an admi|rable
wife. You will &s;ee it will all end in that; for how
can a young lady think of &s;hewing her face again in
the world, after pa&s;&s;ing two or three days privately
with a young fellow, unle&s;s &s;he appears in that cha|racter?
Once I get her in my net, I &s;hall give her
no other cau&s;e of complaint than that of detaining
her as my pri&s;oner; for I mean to deport my&s;elf to|wards
her with the &s;anctity due to a ve&s;tal; and when
&s;he is my wife, you know, I can command her lips, &s;o
that you will have nothing to fear from her. I di&s;|patch
your expre&s;s off again without lo&s;s of time. Hav|ing
made the dog half drunk, I wi&s;h he may not break
his neck, before he arrives at Oxford.</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s Arnold &s;hould receive an account of what
is going forward at Woodberry, before you have time
to return me the an&s;wer I expect, &s;o much the better;
<PB N="43" REF="218">
&s;he will be the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at your de&s;iring a meeting
with her, and the more curious and impatient to have
an explanation from you. But tru&s;t not to the &s;low
conveyance of the po&s;t; leave that for &s;uch plodding
&s;ouls as are content to &s;end their dull conceptions the
common dog-trot road; but fiery &s;pirits, &s;uch as you
and I, &s;hould always have their Mercuries ready to
dart forth in an in&s;tant and execute their high be|he&s;ts.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mi&s;s ARNOLD to Mr. FALKLAND.
[It appears that &s;he inclo&s;ed in this, the letter which,
her &s;i&s;ter Cecilia had written to her, which &s;he re|ceived
the day after its date; and writ to Mr.
Falkland by the return of the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger,
who left it for him as he pa&s;&s;ed through Oxford,
in going home to Woodberry.]
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 11th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FIRST read the enclo&s;ed, and then form to your|&s;elf
an idea of what &s;he feels that writes to you!
I will not an&s;wer my &s;i&s;ter's letter, indeed I <HI>can</HI> not;
for what could I &s;ay to her? Mu&s;t I tell her, &startq;Ce|cilia,
you cannot be the wife of Falkland, <HI>his</HI> faith's
already plighted?&endq;&mdash;but to whom?&mdash;Oh, Falkland,
why did you deceive me? I do not a&s;k your love, I
know that is lo&s;t to me for ever; but I would beg you
to have pity on poor Cecilia, on my mama, and, if you
can, try to have a little on me. If you were torn from
me by death, it would not be <HI>quite</HI> &s;o terrible, for then
I could follow you in &s;ilence and without &s;hame; but
to be di&s;graced thus, ca&s;t off, and for one's own &s;i&s;ter
too! that's very hard. Prithee, dear Orlando, wait
till I am dead before you marry my &s;i&s;ter; it will not
<PB N="44" REF="219">
be long before you &s;hall &s;ee that day. A con&s;titution
naturally feeble, a long &s;truggle again&s;t what at length
bore me down, joined to &s;ickne&s;s and inward grief, had
already warned me that I had not long to live. Save
your&s;elf then, &s;ave your&s;elf the remor&s;e of &s;eeing my
days cut &s;hort by your own hand; &s;ave the tendere&s;t
of mothers the angui&s;h of &s;eeing her daughter fall a vic|tim
to de&s;pair; and &s;ave your dear Cecilia the horror
of knowing you to be the cau&s;e of it. She is unwilling
at this juncture to give you her hand; pray do not
urge her to it.&mdash;You are going to leave England&mdash;be|fore
your return, I &s;hall, in all human probability, be
in my grave. You will then be at liberty to pur&s;ue
your happine&s;s; I love you too well to deprive you of
it. I will not tell my &s;i&s;ter that you ought to have
been mine; let her become your wife, but let <HI>me</HI> not
live to &s;ee it.</P>

<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
[In which he inclo&s;ed Mi&s;s Arnold's letter.]
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have but half done your work, Audley,
for I find I am not yet a fini&s;hed traitor. The
reading the inclo&s;ed letter, which I have ju&s;t received
from Mi&s;s Arnold, has thrown me into a cold &s;weat,
and I almo&s;t repent of my inju&s;tice to her. There
is &s;omething in her &s;oft complaints that pierce my
heart; yet I have gone too far to recede.&mdash;What will
become of me!&mdash;I would give up every hope I have
in life (except the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cecilia) to re&s;tore
this unfortunate girl to the peace of which I have
robbed her. She bids me &s;u&s;pend my marriage&mdash;
What may be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion?
<PB N="45" REF="220">
If &s;he had a&s;ked me to &s;end her a leg or an arm by way
of expiation for my offence again&s;t her, I think I &s;hould
have done it freely.</P>
<P>All the mi&s;eries &s;he has foretold perhaps may come
to pa&s;s, and my life may be rendered more wretched
by the accompli&s;hment, than it would be by the di&s;ap|pointment
of my wi&s;hes. My infidelity conducts <HI>one</HI>
child to the tomb, and the life of the <HI>other</HI> is imbittered
from the &s;ame fatal &s;ource. Mrs. Arnold, that re&s;|pectable
woman who has been more than a parent to
me, cur&s;es me as the cruel de&s;troyer of her family.&mdash;
Execrable, ungrateful Falkland! And thou, Love,
inexorable fiend! will nothing &s;atisfy thy vengeance
but my life, or that of the unfortunate Mi&s;s Ar|nold?</P>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> not write that cur&s;ed letter to her which thou
ha&s;t dictated; I will not add treachery to treachery.
I could almo&s;t call this a &s;acrilege, for is it not giving
up the &s;acred trea&s;ure of innocence to a wicked &s;poiler?
Let the ruin that gapes for you &s;wallow you up quick
if it will; for my part, I am not fit to live.&mdash;Prithee,
Audley, come down and &s;hoot me through the head;
for if &s;ome one does not do it for me&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>OF all devils, I hate a penitent devil. What a no|ble
figure does Satan him&s;elf make, as he is de|&s;cribed
in the &s;ixth book of Milton, where he boldly
de&s;ies the whole artillery of Heaven! And what a
&s;neaking ra&s;cal does he appear in the fourth book,
where, ju&s;t like Falkland, he recapitulates his woes,
and bemoans his lo&s;t e&s;tate! But do, go on, give up
Cecilia, to oblige her &s;i&s;ter, and leave thy name upon
<PB N="46" REF="221">
record for the arrante&s;t poltroon that ever dared to call
him&s;elf a man. But what then? You will have the
con&s;olation of having done a good-natured thing, and
then <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inward rectitude,</HI> as old Price u&s;ed
to &s;ay, will at any time make amends for the lo&s;s of
twenty or thirty thou&s;and pounds, and the fine&s;t girl
in Europe. But the mi&s;chief of it is, the &s;ub&s;tantial
part of the evil won't be remedied by this either, for
thou art &s;o involved in trea&s;on, that take which &s;ide
thou wilt, the matter <HI>can't</HI> be mended. Let's rea&s;on a
little. Mi&s;s Arnold, you &s;ay, has cau&s;e to complain
of your treachery. Granted: (for argument's &s;ake
only.) But will not Cecilia have the &s;ame cau&s;e to
complain if you for&s;ake <HI>her?</HI> She, being ignorant of
the priority of her &s;i&s;ter's claim, has certainly by the
laws of equity as good a right to you as the other;
nay, if one takes in the whole merits of the cau&s;e, a
better; for &s;he had &s;ecretly determined in your favour,
before the other little trembling fool dared even to per|&s;uade
her&s;elf that &s;he loved you. The affair, how|ever,
is, I confe&s;s, &s;omewhat nice, and I am inclined
to think, that were Solomon now alive, and the ca&s;e
brought before him, your &s;weet per&s;on would be con|demned
to undergo the &s;ame &s;entence which he pa&s;&s;ed
on the ha$lot's child. We &s;hould then &s;ee which of the
two girls de&s;erved you be&s;t. I'll be hang'd if Dolly
would not be content with half of you. Why, what
a letter have you received from that pretty Automaton!
The deuce take tho&s;e milky di&s;po&s;itions, &s;ay I, that
have not gall enough in them to rouze them to a little
choler. Would not one, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, have
expected a noble bur&s;t of rage befitting the mouth of a
prince&s;s in a tragedy? Or &s;uppo&s;ing the nymph to
write in the elegaic &s;train, &s;hould not the paper have
been blotted with her tears? ought &s;he not to have
called you <HI>charming</HI> though cruel betrayer, and con|jured
you by every thing that was tender to return to
yonr fir&s;t vows? And &s;hould not there have been &s;ome
little in&s;inuations of hanging on a willow, or drowning
in a purling &s;tream? But no &s;uch thing, Sir, this piece
of living &s;now does not even &s;trive to recall you; &s;he
<PB N="47" REF="222">
renounces your love, &s;he vouch&s;afes not even to up|braid
you, and de&s;ires no other favour than that you
would <HI>po&s;tpone</HI> your marriage till after her death, of
which &s;he talks as familiarly as &s;he would do about a
puppet-&s;how. Hang me, if I don't think &s;he u&s;es you
&s;curvily, and that &s;he does not de&s;erve the lea&s;t pity at
your hands.</P>
<P>And all this water-gruel &s;tuff has thrown you into
a cold &s;weat! How I blu&s;h for thee, Falkland! If
thy body were as infirm as thy mind, thou would&s;t not
be fit to breathe out of an ho&s;pital. And how like a
coward do&s;t thou conclude thy letter! Thou do&s;t not
de&s;erve &s;o noble a death, as that thou would&s;t receive
if I were to take thee at thy word.</P>
<P>But to come at once to the material purpo&s;e of my
letter. You &s;ay you <HI>will not</HI> deliver Mi&s;s Arnold into
my hands, into the hands of a <HI>wicked &s;poiler.</HI> Falk|land!
I expected you would have believed my oath
upon this occa&s;ion; but your own want of &s;incerity
makes you &s;u&s;pect that of others; then hear me &s;wear,
[Sir Edward Audley here makes u&s;e of &s;uch impreca|tions
as the editor would not tran&s;cribe.] By all this,
I vow, if you do not deliver her into my hands, I re|nounce
all farther communication with you, and will
with my own proper tongue, divulge your folly, and
what you <HI>call</HI> your crime, to all the Bidulph family,
to all the world, till you are the ridicule and contempt
of all that know you. You know I dare do what I
&s;ay. Weak irre&s;olute man, are the&s;e the hopes you
gave me? Can the feeble complaints of a love-&s;ick
girl &s;hake you thus? and make you cancel the bonds
of a &s;worn friend&s;hip? And what would be the con|&s;equence
of your da&s;tardly compliance? If you leave
England without making Cecilia your's, mark my
words, you lo&s;e her for ever. Left in the hands of re|lations
that contemn you, expo&s;ed to the conver&s;ation
of a rival, who, though I like him not, let me do him
the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, has but too much to recommend him.
And who can an&s;wer (though my vengeance were out
of the que&s;tion) who can an&s;wer for the genero&s;ity of
a for&s;aken mi&s;tre&s;s? think you that Mi&s;s Arnold would
<PB N="48" REF="223">
not divulge the &s;ecret? Oh, you know but a little of
womankind; if <HI>we</HI> do not betray them, they are &s;ure
to betray them&s;elves. In a word, you have no &s;ecu|rity
but in the method I have propo&s;ed. Your own
intere&s;t as well as mine &s;hould determine you at once.
Put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my <HI>prize,</HI> and I'll an&s;wer for
the accompli&s;hment of <HI>your</HI> wi&s;hes; nay, I'll undertake
to exculpate you from the imputation of this double
treachery, at which you are &s;o much &s;cared, and that
by the ea&s;ie&s;t turn imaginable. I will tell the lady that
you had really come to town on purpo&s;e to pro&s;trate
your&s;elf at her feet, and beg her forgivene&s;s: That
you had actually intended meeting her at the very place
appointed; but that, as the hour of this dreaded in|terview
drew near, you found you had not courage
enough to &s;upport the &s;ight of <HI>her</HI> you had &s;o much
injured; wherefore calling for pen, ink, and paper,
you had contented your&s;elf with writing to her, and
having left the letter in my hands to be put into her's,
you immediately mounted your hor&s;e and again went
out of town. Then will I faithfully deliver to her your
petitionary &s;croll; in which if &s;he finds any incon|&s;i&s;tencies,
it mu&s;t be imputed to your troubled mind.
And after having a&s;&s;ured her of the &s;incerity of <HI>your</HI> in|tentions,
I will take upon <HI>my&s;elf</HI> the blame of having
turned them to the intere&s;t of my own love.</P>
<P>Things will not now admit of fooli&s;h delays; you
know my ultimate re&s;olution, &s;o I leave you to think
of it, and give you four and twenty hours to con&s;ider
of my propo&s;ition, but not a minute beyond it.</P>
<CLOSER>Your's, <SIGNED>E. A.</SIGNED>

<P>HERE, take it then, Sir Edward. I have writ|ten

<OPENER>Lady SARAH to Sir GEORGE BIDULPH.
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 15th.</DATE></DATELINE>
My dear Sir George,</OPENER>
<P>WE are all here in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion imagi|nable.
I believe it is a very true ob&s;ervation,
that evils never come alone. Mi&s;s Arnold, your
grave, prudent, favourite niece, has thought proper to
elope. She a&s;ked my leave ye&s;terday morning to wait
on Mrs. B&mdash;, who, &s;he &s;aid, had &s;ent to reque&s;t her
company to dinner. You know no one on earth can
be more careful than I am of what company I let her
<PB N="50" REF="225">
keep; but as Mrs. B&mdash;is really an extremely good
&s;ort of a woman, and very well bred, I never &s;crupled
to let her go there. Mrs. B&mdash;'s family dine ear|ly,
and Mi&s;s cho&s;e to go even &s;ooner than their hour
of dining. As &s;he complained of not being very well,
I &s;ent her in my own chair: Robert attended her. I
had an infinity of vi&s;its to pay in the evening, and
when I went out, ordered my chair to go again for her
at &s;even o'clock; but when I came home, which was
at a little after ten, I found all the hou&s;e in a bu&s;tle;
the &s;ervants told me Mi&s;s Arnold was not yet come in,
and that they could give no account of her at Mrs.
B&mdash;'s. I immediately called up Robert, who
&s;aid that having attended her in the forenoon to Mrs.
B&mdash;, that he and the chairmen had orders to
wait a while; that Mi&s;s Arnold &s;taid not longer than
a quarter of an hour there, and then directed them to
carry her to a milliner's &s;hop in the &s;ame &s;treet, where
&s;he went in and looked at &s;ome fans; after which &s;he
&s;tepped to the door, and telling the &s;ervants, that as
&s;he had &s;everal things to buy which might detain her
a good while, they need not wait, for being &s;o near
Mrs. B&mdash;with whom &s;he was to dine, &s;he would
walk back to her hou&s;e. The man &s;ays he begged &s;he
would let the chair carry her back, left &s;he &s;hould
catch cold; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on their going home, tel|ling
Robert his lady might have occa&s;ion for him;
upon which they went away, and left her there. I
a&s;ked the fellow why he did not tell me this as &s;oon as
he returned; but his an&s;wer was, he thought nothing
of it.</P>
<P>When they went for her in the evening to Mrs.
B&mdash;'s, they were informed that &s;he had not been
there &s;ince noon. The brutes had not the &s;en&s;e to a&s;k
any more que&s;tions; but came away with this an&s;wer.
I hurried away directly to Mrs. B&mdash;'s, and found
the poor woman really under great unea&s;ine&s;s; for
having been told by her own &s;ervants that mine had
been to look for Mi&s;s Arnold; &s;he had it &s;eems in the
interim &s;ent to my hou&s;e to know if &s;he were returned
home. All the account &s;he could give me of her was
<PB N="51" REF="226">
this. That &s;he had in reality &s;ent the evening before
to reque&s;t Mi&s;s Arnold's company to dine with her, as
&s;he was to be quite alone; that your niece had &s;ent
her word, &s;he could not then give a po&s;itive an&s;wer,
as lady Sarah was not at home (which was indeed
true): That when Mi&s;s Arnold had called upon her
about one o'clock that &s;ame day, &s;he told her &s;he was
only come to make her excu&s;es to her for not having it
in her power to dine with her as we had company at
home, (there were two or three <HI>humble</HI> friends) but
that &s;he would &s;lip out to her for a couple of hours in
the afternoon; &s;he added, that Mi&s;s &s;eemed in a good
deal of ha&s;te, and took her leave in le&s;s than a quar|ter
of an hour.</P>
<P>Finding I could learn no more from Mrs. B&mdash;,
I drove, late as it was, to the milliner's, and took the
pains of climbing up two pair of narrow dirty &s;tairs
to the woman's chamber. I a&s;ked her if &s;uch a young
lady, de&s;cribing Mi&s;s Arnold's dre&s;s and equipage, had
not been at her &s;hop that day? She told me there
had; but that &s;he had not the honour of knowing her;
and that the lady, after having bought &s;ome little mat|ters
of her, had reque&s;ted that &s;he would let one of
her &s;hop maids call her a hackney-coach, which &s;he
did, and the young lady drove away in it, having
pulled up both the coach windows; but &s;he heard not
to what place the coach-man was directed. I made
her in my pre&s;ence demand of her &s;ervant, whether
&s;he knew the number, or the coach-man? The
wench &s;aid &s;he knew neither one nor t'other, having
met the coach by hazard in the &s;treet: And this was
all the information I could get, notwith&s;tanding the
infinite trouble I took on the occa&s;ion. I am mo&s;t ex|ceedingly
vexed that I took the charge of any young
per&s;on, with who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition I was not better ac|quainted;
yet I really thought Mi&s;s Arnold a mode&s;t
good young body; but 'tis plain I was deceived, for
be &s;he where &s;he will, 'ti$ certain &s;he is gone with her
own inclination, and had concerted her whole plan
before-hand. 'Tis quite an aenigma to me, <HI>with</HI> whom
or <HI>to</HI> whom &s;he can be gone; but I take it for granted,
<PB N="52" REF="227">
there is &s;ome intrigue in the ca&s;e, and that following
her &s;i&s;ter's example, &s;he means to introduce into the
family &s;ome little ob&s;cure wretch. Mrs. Arnold may
now &s;ee the con&s;equence of breeding her daughters
up in the country. Yet I really pity the poor woman,
for being &s;o unfortunate in her children. As matters
now &s;tand, I &s;uppo&s;e neither you nor my lord V&mdash;
will think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tay much longer at Wood|berry.
Pray pre&s;ent my humble &s;ervice to his lord|&s;hip,
and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>Brumpton, <DATE>March 14th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALL's &s;afe; I have her, Falkland; the &s;oft tur|tle
may beat her wings again&s;t her pri&s;on walls;
but it will not be in her power to e&s;cape. Let me tell
you how it was.&mdash;Having received your letter early
ye&s;terday morning, I di&s;patched that which was in|clo&s;ed
for her, by a porter with proper in&s;tructions.
He brought back ju&s;t two lines, to inform Mr. Falk|land
&s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ee him the next day at
the place appointed, and that &s;he &s;hould bring Mi&s;s
Audley with her. A note was by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger
brought to my &s;i&s;ter, (whom you may &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did
not know to be out of town) wherein Mi&s;s Arnold told
her &s;he had important bu&s;ine&s;s with her, and begged
&s;he would be at home the next day in the forenoon,
when &s;he would call on her.</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured my ground thus far, I drove out
this morning to my lodge, leaving a &s;trict charge with
David to be on the watch at home, and when Mi&s;s
Arnold called for my &s;i&s;ter, if on not finding her in
town &s;he &s;hould a&s;k whether a note had not been left
for her the day before? David was to produce the
<PB N="53" REF="228">
identical note out of his pocket, (which having been
only wafer'd, I had with ea&s;e opened and &s;ealed up
again) and to tell her he would be &s;ure to give it to
Mi&s;s Audley, when &s;he came to town, which would
not be for the&s;e five or &s;ix days. This you &s;ee reduced
her friend to go to her rendezvous without her. I or|dered
my rogue, who you know has the fine&s;t &s;impli|city
of countenance imaginable, to tell her, if &s;he
&s;hould chance to enquire how I did, (which was na|tural
enough) that I had drove out that morning to
take the air, To <HI>Brumpton,</HI> as he thought he heard me
direct the coach-man, but he could not be po&s;itive for
fear of telling a lye. This precaution was nece&s;&s;ary,
that &s;he might not be &s;urprized or alarmed at &s;eeing
me receive her at her fir&s;t coming in&s;tead of you.</P>
<P>Every thing happened ju&s;t as I had fore&s;een; and
between two and three o'clock, I &s;aw a hackney-coach
driving bri&s;kly up to the hou&s;e. I was ready at the
door to pre&s;ent her my hand; &s;he looked as pale as
a&s;hes, and trembled from head to foot. Oh, Sir Ed|ward!
was all &s;he could utter. Compo&s;e your&s;elf,
dear madam, was all my reply. I &s;upported her up
&s;tairs to the dining-room, for &s;he was &s;carce able to
walk, and placing her in an ea&s;y-chair by the fire, took:
a turn about the room to give her time to recover her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Where is your friend, Sir? &s;aid &s;he, at length, I
now approached her, and with the voice and look of
a &s;uppliant, Prepare your&s;elf, madam; &s;aid I, to hear
a &s;tory, which though perhaps it may excite your re|&s;entment
again&s;t me, yet mu&s;t it turn your ju&s;ter in|dignation
again&s;t a perfidious man who has betrayed$
you. (You know I was not to mince the matter.)
Where is he? cried &s;he, where is Falkland? looking
wildly about her. He is not now here, replied I
Not here? good God! and &s;he &s;tarted from her
chair: I ventured (putting one knee to the ground)
with a timid action, &s;uch as you have &s;een u&s;ed by a
poor &s;purn'd lover in a tragedy, to lay hold on the cor|ner
of her robe, and gently withheld her from going.
Have patience, deare&s;t madam, and hear what I have
<PB N="54" REF="229">
to &s;ay. Falkland is no longer worthy of you, he
abandons you, and marries your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I could add no
more; for, as if &s;truck by a &s;udden fla&s;h of lightening,
&s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the carpet. I endeavoured to re|call
her to life by the ordinary means of cha&s;ing her
temples, and throwing water on her face; but to no
purpo&s;e; and to own the truth, I thought her &s;oft
eyes were clo&s;ed for ever. I ha&s;tily called up the ma|tron
and her daughter, and having with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
rai&s;ed the lifele&s;s beauty, we put her into the arm'd-chair,
and I retired to another room, as the women
propo&s;ed cutting her lace, at which operation my ba&s;h|fulne&s;s
would not &s;uffer me to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Having brought her to her&s;elf, I was &s;ummoned
again into the chamber. She had a bottle of &s;alts in
her hand, which &s;he held to her no&s;e, her eyes were
&s;till &s;hut; but on my a&s;king tenderly how &s;he did, &s;he
opened them, and looking earne&s;tly at me, and then
by turns at the two women, Did not &s;ome of you tell
me, &s;aid &s;he, that they were actually married? Well,
who can help it! Cecilia has eyes and a heart as well
as other people; but then one's own &s;i&s;ter, there is
&s;omething &s;o mortifying in that! Would not you
think it very hard, Mi&s;s? to the young dam&s;el who
&s;tood by her. I perceived &s;he was not perfectly come
to her&s;elf, and making a motion to the women, they
withdrew, and I placed my&s;elf on a chair be&s;ide her,
though at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance. Endeavour to collect
your &s;pirits, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Arnold. I could kill my&s;elf
for having been (though unwillingly) the cau&s;e of
throwing you into &s;uch di&s;order. But are you &s;ure,
&s;aid &s;he, that you have told me truth? for men are &s;o
<HI>very</HI> deceitful&mdash;I have Falkland's own word for
it, an&s;wered I.&mdash;Oh, then he <HI>is</HI> here after all?
&s;aid &s;he. He is not, I a&s;&s;ure you, madam; he is now
actually at Oxford.&mdash;But I tell you, Sir Edward,
I had a letter from him ye&s;terday, and I promi&s;ed to
meet him here to-day, or el&s;e I dreamt &s;o, for every
thing appears very &s;trange to me. 'Tis very true, &s;aid
I; he came to town ye&s;terday in order to have a con|ference
with you. And here, Falkland, did I faith|fully
<PB N="55" REF="230">
acquit my&s;elf of my promi&s;e to you, de&s;cribing
you as a man overwhelmed with &s;hame and remor&s;e
for your crime; and concluded with pre&s;enting her
the letter, with which I told her you had charged me.
An indignant blu&s;h kindled for a moment on her lan|guid
face, whil&s;t &s;he read; which fading away again
into its former palene&s;s; This is cruel, &s;aid &s;he, it
pierces deep; and &s;he &s;hrunk as if &s;he had felt her&s;elf
&s;tung by &s;omething venomous.</P>
<P>He told me, &s;aid I, that you had reque&s;ted of him
to po&s;tpone his marriage&mdash;So, then, interrupted &s;he,
with a half &s;mile, you know the whole of my di&s;|grace!
Say rather of your injuries, &s;aid I, and of
Falkland's ba&s;ene&s;s, (it was meet that I &s;hould abu&s;e
you like a dog); but pa&s;&s;ionately as he adores your &s;i&s;|ter,
he &s;aid he found it impo&s;&s;ible to obey you; and
as Mi&s;s Cecilia had already con&s;ented to be his, he was
re&s;olved to pre&s;s her to the immediate accompli&s;hment
of her promi&s;e, depending on the gentlene&s;s of your
nature, which he thinks will not &s;uffer you to inter|po&s;e
your wrongs to divide them. He begged of me
to &s;ay every thing that I could in ex$enuation of his
fault; and without li&s;tening to the reproaches that I
made him, left me in order to take po&s;t immediately
for Oxford. What could I do, proceeded I, &s;often|ing
my voice, and preparing to breathe out &s;ome ten|der
things, what, charming Mi&s;s Arnold, could I do?
&mdash;Alas, &s;he heard me not; a &s;econd fainting-fit
had &s;eized the mournful fair. During the time that I
&s;poke, &s;he fate with her head reclined on one of her
arms, which re&s;ted on the elbow of the chair, her
hand covering her eyes partly concealed her face from
me; but the conclu&s;ion of my tale again deprived her
of her &s;en&s;es, and it was the dropping of this white
and lifele&s;s arm that adverti&s;ed me of it.</P>
<P>Again were the women called up, again we had re|cour&s;e
to all the female apparatus of hart&s;horn, hun|gary-water,
and burnt feathers, for this fit was longer
and more ob&s;tinate than the former. At la&s;t &s;he came
to her&s;elf; but the women found her &s;o extremely fee|ble,
that without &s;aying any thing to me, (who had
<PB N="56" REF="231">
once more withdrawn; ob&s;erve my punctilio, Falk|land)
or even con&s;ulting Mi&s;s Arnold her&s;elf, they im|mediately
undre&s;&s;ed her and put her to bed in an ad|joining
chamber, before &s;he had &s;ufficiently recovered
her recollection to oppo&s;e their motions.</P>
<P>Having given the due prai&s;e to this their prudent
conduct, I de&s;ired them both to attend on the lady
with the utmo&s;t care and re&s;pect; and if when &s;he
was thoroughly come to her&s;elf, &s;he &s;hould attempt to
ri&s;e in order to go away, that they, through a tender
care of her health, &s;hould by no means permit it;
but to calm her unea&s;ine&s;s they were to tell her, that I
(being in the utmo&s;t fright and anxiety about her) had
gone to town in the coach which had brought her thi|ther,
in order to bring a phy&s;ician, and had charged
them not to let her &s;tir, till I had his opinion whether
&s;he might be removed with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;po&s;ed matters, I drove home in the
afore&s;aid coach, (which &s;he had retained in order to
bring her back) and in about two hours returned again
accompanied by an able doctor, whom I had brought
to vi&s;it the &s;ick lady. One of my tru&s;ty guardians met
us in the hall, and taking me a&s;ide told me, that the
young lady having recovered her&s;elf pretty well &s;oon
after I had gone away, had expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;ur|prize
and terror at finding her&s;elf in bed in a hou&s;e
&s;he knew not, demanded where &s;he was? and where
Mr. Falkland and her &s;i&s;ter were? to both which que&s;|tions
the women having an&s;wered her agreeably to the
truth, &s;he de&s;ired that her cloaths might be brought to
her, that &s;he might dre&s;s her&s;elf and go home. They
then told her, according to my in&s;tructions, that &s;he
mu&s;t not think of &s;tirring till the arrival of the doctor,
whom they expected every minute; and that they
could not an&s;wer it to their con&s;ciences, to let her de|part
in the weak condition in which &s;he then was,
without his leave. She in&s;i&s;ted neverthele&s;s on going;
but a fre&s;h ob&s;tacle was repre&s;ented to her, viz. that
&s;he had no method of conveyance to town. She was
quite out of patience at this, and &s;aid &s;he would walk;
but this was treated as an impo&s;&s;ibility; for had &s;he
<PB N="57" REF="232">
even been in a condition to undertake &s;uch a walk, the
roads were &s;o wet and dirty as to make it impractica|ble;
&s;he knew not a &s;tep of the way; they had no
body they could &s;end to conduct her; and they them|&s;elves,
poor &s;ouls, could not leave the hou&s;e; the mo|ther
was old and infirm, and the daughter could not
be &s;pared, as &s;he had the care of every thing upon her.
She &s;till continued earne&s;tly a&s;king for her cloaths, that
&s;he might at lea&s;t get up and dre&s;s her&s;elf, in order to
be in readine&s;s to return to town with the phy&s;ician,
whom they &s;aid they expected; but this reque&s;t they
al&s;o thought them&s;elves obliged for the lady's good
to refu&s;e; &s;o that partly by entreaties, partly by argu|ments,
and partly by a little gentle compul&s;ion, they
had &s;till detained her in bed, where &s;he had continued
to talk, and bewail her&s;elf without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>After having received this account, we proceeded to
the chamber of the lady. I kept an aweful di&s;tance,
not pre&s;uming to appear in &s;ight. The doctor ap|proached
her bed-&s;ide, and de&s;iring permi&s;&s;ion to feel
her pul&s;e, pronounced her in a fever, and that the
con&s;equence would be fatal, if &s;he ventured to leave
her bed.&mdash;He a&s;ked her if &s;he felt any pain? She
made him no an&s;wer, but pointed with her finger to
her forehead. I thought &s;o, &s;aid he, but I &s;hall order
&s;omething for you; then charging them that &s;he
&s;hould be kept extremely quiet, not &s;uffered to &s;peak
a word, and be made to drink plentifully of balm-tea;
he called for pen, ink; and paper, and &s;ate down to
write his pre&s;cription. Whil&s;t he was thus employed,
I ventured to draw near the bed-&s;ide, and &s;peaking in
a low voice, I told Mi&s;s Arnold, I only waited her
commands, to go to town again in order to acquaint
her friends with her &s;ituation; and a&s;ked whether &s;he
would not chu&s;e to have lady Sarah Bidulph come to
her, &s;ince the doctor was of opinion it might endan|ger
her life to be removed?</P>
<P>I do indeed find my&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he, quite unable to
ri&s;e; yet I &s;hould have made a &s;hift to walk if they
had let me gone at fir&s;t; but now my &s;trength is quite
exhau&s;ted; my head too feels giddy, the chamber
<PB N="58" REF="233">
&s;eems to turn round.&mdash;Lady Sarah will certainly
attend you when &s;he knows the condition in which
you are; &s;hall I wait on her, madam, for that pur|po&s;e?
Oh, Sir, do you think &s;he would &s;hew any
compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a ca&s;t-away? No, no, &s;he mu&s;t
not know a word of the matter. For God's &s;ake, Sir,
(joining her hands together, and &s;peaking quite in a
whi&s;per) can't you contrive to have a chair &s;ent to me
here! I may be carried to Mrs. B&mdash;'s; I pro|mi&s;ed
to go to her this evening.&mdash;I perceived &s;he
made this reque&s;t in a low voice, that the doctor might
not hear her and oppo&s;e it; but as it was my intere&s;t
that he &s;hould, I an&s;wered her loud enough to reach
his ears; I will &s;end for a chair immediately, madam;
I think you cannot run any great ri&s;que in being car|ried
to town, provided you are wrapped up warmly.&mdash;
The doctor, who had ju&s;t then fini&s;hed his pre&s;cription,
turning ha&s;tily about, What is that you are plea&s;ed to
&s;ay, Sir, &s;aid he, that the lady will run no ri&s;que in
being carried to town? I &s;hould hope &s;o, Doctor, re|plied
I, as it is of the utmo&s;t importance to her to re|turn
thither this evening. It &s;he has any thing that
requires her attention that is of more importance to
her than her <HI>life,</HI> &s;aid he, 'tis another affair; and in
that ca&s;e, I don't &s;ee any occa&s;ion you had to con&s;ult
me; but as I look upon her to be in a dangerous way,
having one of tho&s;e rapid fevers which increa&s;e hourly,
you are to take the con&s;equence of removing her upon
your&s;elves; but I &s;hall expect at lea&s;t that <HI>my</HI> charac|ter
will be cleared from any blame that may alight on
it. He then threw his pre&s;cription on the table, which
he had held in his hand while he &s;poke, and left the
room croaking out pre&s;ages of mortality in ca&s;e of di&s;|obedience
to his orders.</P>
<P>The two women who were pre&s;ent, and who &s;eem|ed
extremely frightened at what he &s;aid, now de|clared
with one voice, that they would not &s;uffer
the lady to be &s;tirred; to be &s;ure the doctor knew
better than we did, what was proper; and they were
&s;urprized that a gentleman of my &s;en&s;e would offer to
act contrary to his advice. As for the poor lady her|&s;elf,
<PB N="59" REF="234">
it was no wonder &s;he did not know what &s;he was
&s;aying, as &s;ickne&s;s was &s;o apt to put people out of their
right minds; but for their own parts, they would not
for all they were worth in the world have &s;uch a &s;in to
an&s;wer for as the lady's death, which no doubt would
be the con&s;equence of her leaving her bed in the terri|ble
condition in which &s;he then was.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold, now finding all her hopes of getting
away entirely fru&s;trated, bur&s;t into tears: Then I am
lo&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, expo&s;ed, and ruined! I cannot out-live
the &s;hame of having the cau&s;e of this illne&s;s known.
Have patience, dear madam; I will go to Mrs. B&mdash;
to inform her of your &s;ituation; your <HI>illne&s;s</HI> cannot
be kept a &s;ecret, though the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it may; you
mu&s;t confide in &s;ome one; Mrs. B&mdash;is a good
woman, &s;he is your friend.&mdash;Sir, I have no friends,
no relations, I am a poor creature abandoned by every
body.&mdash;Do not &s;ay &s;o, madam; you &s;ee a man before
you who would &s;acrifice his life to &s;erve you.&mdash;
Thank you, Sir, thank you; I would be glad to &s;ee
Mrs. B&mdash;, though I believe &s;he will not come to me.
&mdash;I will go to her directly, madam; there is no doubt
but &s;he will attend you. In the mean time be a&s;&s;ured
you are in the hands of very careful and very hone&s;t
people. I hope in a day or two you will be able to
venture out; in the interim; let me conjure you to
compo&s;e your thoughts as much as po&s;&s;ible; the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment
of your health depends chiefly on the
tranquillity of your mind.</P>
<P>I took my leave on this, and making a &s;ign to the
antient matron, &s;he followed me out of the room,
leaving her daughter at the bed-&s;ide of the lady. I
a&s;ked her what &s;he thought of the real &s;tate of our pa|tient's
health. She &s;aid &s;he was certain that the whole
of her di&s;order aro&s;e from the violent agitation of her
mind, and that &s;he believed a good night's re&s;t would
&s;et all to rights again; that &s;he had felt her hand, and
thought her not in the lea&s;t feveri&s;h; on the contrary,
&s;he had found her extremely low; and as her &s;trength
and &s;pirits had been &s;o much, exhau&s;ted by her faint|ing-&s;its,
&s;he was of opinion that a gla&s;s or two of good
<PB N="60" REF="235">
wine would be of more &s;ervice to her than all the
drugs in the apothecary's &s;hop. As I have an implicit
faith in this good woman's &s;kill, I remained perfectly
&s;atisfied with the judgment &s;he had pronounced; and
agreeing with her, that the &s;ickne&s;s of the mind was
beyond the power of medicine to reach, I contented
my&s;elf with ordering the prudent dame to give the
lady &s;ome of her own little innocent cordials, which
&s;he kept for her private drinking, and to pa&s;s them on
her for the doctor's pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>You will be &s;urprized, perhaps, that after having
already had the advice of an eminent phy&s;ician, I
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k that of an old woman. To
account for this part of my conduct, you mu&s;t know
that this &s;ame doctor, though exceedingly &s;kilful in his
way, is not remarkable for his veracity, and in the
ca&s;e before us had &s;aid neither more nor le&s;s than what
I dictated to him: In &s;hort, it was no other than my
villain David, on whom I had clap'd a large periwig,
and given him a diploma to practi&s;e in the pre&s;ent
emergency.</P>
<P>This imaginary indi&s;po&s;ition (for there is more of
fancy than reality in it) has been the luckie&s;t thing in
the world, as it has furni&s;hed me with a pretence for
detaining her one night at lea&s;t without having re|cour&s;e
to ab&s;olute force, which was my original in|tention;
for my plan was to have &s;et out with her at
midnight, and carried her to my friend Bendi&s;he's hou&s;e
on Bag&s;hot-heath, whom I have already apprized of
my de&s;ign. His mother is lately dead, and he is now
king of the ca&s;tle. Thither do I mean to convey my
pri&s;oner; but I think from the view of things which
I now have, that I &s;hall be able to effect this by &s;trata|gem,
which I &s;hould much prefer to violence for more
rea&s;ons than one.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e in which we are at pre&s;ent, I do not
look upon as a place of &s;ecurity for any long continu|ance;
for be&s;ides its being too near London, there is
more than a chance of her being di&s;covered here by
means of the coachman who drove her down hither;
for though I have endeavoured, by virtue of a good
<PB N="61" REF="236">
bribe, to charm the dog's tongue to &s;ilence, yet 'tis
natural to &s;uppo&s;e the Bidulphs will leave nothing un|attempted
to find him out; and the &s;ame &s;pecific of
which I made u&s;e to &s;hut his mouth, will infallibly
open it.</P>
<P>'Tis my wi&s;h to have it <HI>blazed</HI> abroad that the fair|one
is in my hands; my only care is to &s;ecrete her till
the in&s;olent family &s;hall think them&s;elves happy in find|ing
her no other than my wife.</P>
<P>Set thy mind at re&s;t, Falkland, with regard to her
health; for be a&s;&s;ured her di&s;order is nothing more
than the natural con&s;equence of that flurry into which
&s;he has been thrown by this day's adventure. Some|what,
perhaps, may be attributed to the &s;kill with
which the doctor conducted him&s;elf: for let a per&s;on
be but a little indi&s;po&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time under
a violent depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, (which was our ca&s;e)
and a judicious phy&s;ician &s;hall be able, at any time, to
per&s;uade them that they are in mortal danger.</P>
<P>To-morrow you &s;hall know how I acquit my&s;elf of
my pretended commi&s;&s;ion to Mrs. B&mdash;; but as I
would not keep you in &s;u&s;pence, I &s;hall &s;end this off
directly by Jerry, who is now cracking his whip in the
yard, as I ordered him to attend on purpo&s;e for my di&s;|patches.
I &s;uppo&s;e to-morrow, or next day, you will
have lady Sarah's account of this affair come lagging
in like a jaded hor&s;e that was thrown out of the cour&s;e;
and then we &s;hall have the old hou&s;e at Woodberry
in &s;uch a commotion as you have &s;ometimes &s;een an
ant's ne&s;t. Probably it may retard your nuptials for a
while: but if they wait till the &s;tray'd lamb is reco|vered,
it will require more patience than can be rea|&s;onably
expected in a lover; for I tell thee, Falkland,
that powers terre&s;trial nor infernal &s;hall not &s;natch her
from me.</P>
<P>'Tis now eight o'clock, I am &s;uppo&s;ed by mi&s;s
Arnold to be at London. She expects every minute
the arrival of her friend Mrs. B&mdash;. I go to put
an end to her expectations, at lea&s;t for to-night.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Sir EDWARD AUDLEY to Mr. FALKLAND.
<DATELINE>Brumpton, <DATE>March 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE have I been &s;ince la&s;t night, Falkland,
like a &s;pider &s;pinning my toils, with no other
materials than what my own proper brains furni&s;h me
withal. And my poor little fly, uncon&s;cious of the
&s;nare, is now &s;o intangled, that, hopele&s;s of e&s;cape,
&s;he has e'en left off &s;truggling.</P>
<P>After I had left her ye&s;terday evening, in order to
wait on Mrs. B&mdash;, &s;he remained pretty tranquil, in
hopes of her friend's arrival. Not to keep her, how|ever,
too long in an unea&s;y &s;tate of uncertainty, I
thought proper, after I had di&s;patched my letter to
you, to &s;end a note to her by one of the women,
with orders to &s;ay &s;he had received it from my &s;er|vant;
in which I told her, that Mrs. B&mdash;would at|tend
her the next morning; and that, not thinking it
prudent to allow my&s;elf the liberty of &s;eeing her that
night, I cho&s;e to write rather than be the bearer of
this me&s;&s;age. There was decorum for you! I can
tell you, it had its weight; for &s;he prai&s;ed my di&s;cre|tion,
at the &s;ame time that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf ex|ceedingly
grieved and di&s;appointed that Mrs. B&mdash;
did not come to her immediately. She remained very
unquiet the whole night, without once clo&s;ing her
eyes. Sleep, barbarous &s;leep, for&s;akes the pillows of
the unfortunate. Gladly would I have watched her
re&s;tle&s;s couch&mdash;but decency forbid it; and I had this
account only from the nymph who pa&s;&s;ed the night at
her bed-&s;ide. About eleven o'clock I thought it ex|pedient
to make my appearance; and having begged
the &s;avour of an audience, I was admitted into her
chamber. (I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, by the way, that
<PB N="63" REF="238">
&s;he had again called for her cloaths, and had intreated
for leave to ri&s;e in order to receive me, but was per|emptorily
refu&s;ed by her careful nur&s;es; one of them,
however, was commanded to &s;tay in the room). Well,
Sir, &s;aid &s;he, with a look of impatience, where is
Mrs. B&mdash;? I went to her hou&s;e, madam, agreeably
to your de&s;ire, as &s;oon as I got to town&mdash;And won't
&s;he come, Sir? Unfortunately, madam, I could not
&s;ee her la&s;t night; her maid told me &s;he had been
taken &s;uddenly ill, and was obliged to be put to bed
about an hour before. As I found it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for her to attend you that night, I did not care
to di&s;turb the poor lady's repo&s;e, by informing her of
your &s;ituation. It was for the &s;ame rea&s;on, with re|gard
to you, (pardon me, dear madam) that I ventur|ed
to deceive you, by writing you word &s;he would
wait on you this morning. I thought, indeed, I but
anticipated the truth; that I could have an&s;wered for
her intentions; and that her di&s;order, which I hoped
was but &s;ome little temporary complaint, would not
have hindered her from fulfilling the promi&s;e I had
made in her name. God help me! then I am not to
&s;ee her? Is &s;he &s;ick, Sir? or is it that &s;he refu&s;es to
come to the &s;uccour of &s;uch a poor forlorn wretch? I
made a long pau&s;e, then replied, She is <HI>really</HI> ill,
madam&mdash;I wi&s;h that was the only di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tance
I had to tell you&mdash;Another long pau&s;e,
with a very troubled countenance&mdash;Pray, &s;ir, &s;peak;
have you &s;een Mrs. B&mdash;; I have, madam, I was at
her hou&s;e again this morning; and having &s;ent up
word that I had important bu&s;ine&s;s with her, I was
admitted to her chamber, where I found her in bed;
for &s;he &s;till continued ill. I wait on you, madam,
&s;aid I, at the reque&s;t of Mi&s;s Arnold, who, relying on
the friend&s;hip you have always had for her, reque&s;ts to
&s;ee you immediately on a very particular occa&s;ion&mdash;
She cut me &s;hort before I had time to proceed&mdash;Good
God, cried &s;he, what has the ra&s;h girl done! You'll
pardon me, Sir Edward, but I cannot help calling her
&s;o. I know &s;he has not been at home all night. Lady
Sarah Bidulph &s;ent hither, both la&s;t night and this
<PB N="64" REF="239">
morning, in &s;earch of her&mdash;I little imagined &s;he had
put her&s;elf in your hands!&mdash;Then lifting up her eyes,
Poor dear Mrs. Arnold, &s;aid &s;he, how much are you
to be pitied! Though I mu&s;t acknowlege, &s;ir, you
are a more eligible choice than Mr. Falkland. I found
Mrs. B&mdash;was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a belief, which, had
it been well founded, would have made me but too
happy. I made ha&s;te to undeceive her, a&s;&s;uring her
I was very far from being the fortunate man &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed
me, and was going to explain the reality of your
&s;ituation, when, by the mo&s;t unlucky chance imagi|nable,
we were interrupted by the arrival of lady Sarah
Bidulph. She was u&s;hered into the chamber by Mr.
B&mdash;him&s;elf; &s;o that we had not the lea&s;t previous
notice of her coming. It &s;eems her anixiety, with re|gard
to you, madam, had brought her in per&s;on to
enquire if Mrs. B&mdash;had learned any news of you.
Mr. B&mdash;, I &s;uppo&s;e, had been told that I was with
his lady, and his curio&s;ity to know the occa&s;ion of
this vi&s;it had induced him to lead in lady Sarah in that
abrupt manner. We can get no tidings of this un|fortunate
girl, &s;aid lady Sarah, as &s;oon as &s;he entered
the room; dear Mrs. B&mdash;have you heard nothing of
her &s;ince? Here is a gentleman, madam, &s;aid Mrs.
B&mdash;, who can give you &s;ome account of her. Lady
Sarah turned towards me, and, with a look of a&s;ton|i&s;hment
&s;carcely to be de&s;cribed, What! Sir <HI>Edward
Audley!</HI> &s;aid &s;he; and &s;topped, looking at Mrs. B&mdash;,
as if her amazement had deprived her of she power of
&s;peech. Oh, oh, then I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Mr. B&mdash;, that
the young ladies re&s;olving to keep each other in coun|tenance,
Mi&s;s Arnold has given Sir Edward to your
lady&s;hip for a kin&s;man. I am very &s;orry to &s;ay, repli|ed
I, that the lady has not done me that honour. So
much the wor&s;e, cried Mr. B&mdash;with an oath, (for
the poor man &s;wears &s;adly;) for if a girl elopes from
her friends, and &s;pends the night the Lord knows
where, unle&s;s &s;he can account for it by matrimony,
&s;he'll make but a devili&s;h &s;illy figure when &s;he comes
back. You'll forgive me, madam, for repeating his
words; but you know Mr. B&mdash;has a coar&s;e manner
of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="240">
I now found my&s;elf under &s;uch an embarra&s;&s;ment
that I &s;carce knew what to &s;ay. I &s;aw the ju&s;tification
of your character (dearer to me than any other con&s;i|deration)
required ray declaring the truth at large;
yet the not having your permi&s;&s;ion to make any expla|nations
to lady Sarah Bidulph, checked my tongue;
and before I had time to frame any reply, Pray, where
is the lady? &s;aid lady Sarah, if I may take the liber|ty
of a&s;king. As I thought in this particular any con|cealment
would be highly improper, I he&s;itated not to
tell her preci&s;ely where you were; adding, that as a
&s;udden and violent attack of illne&s;s had detained you
the whole night, and, as I feared, was &s;till likely to
confine you for &s;ome time to your bed, you had beg|ged
to &s;ee Mrs. B&mdash;, to whom you would make &s;uch
explanations as you hoped, through her mediation,
would induce your friends to pardon a &s;eeming failure
of duty, into which an unexpected event had unwarily
led you. I &s;uppo&s;e, an&s;wered lady Sarah, that the
young lady, &s;eeing the good effects of her &s;i&s;terr's fine|laid
&s;tratagem, intends to play the &s;ame farce over
again at Brumpton that Mi&s;s Cecilia did at Woodber|$y;
and hopes, under a pretence of illne&s;s, by getting
her friends about her, to prevail with them as ea&s;ily
to con&s;ent to her whimfies as they have done to tho&s;e
of her &s;i&s;ter. Faith, I am of your lady&s;hip's opinion,
&s;aid Mr. B&mdash;laughing; but if you would take my
advice, you would e'en let Sir Edward keep her now
he has her. Such faux pas as cannot be mended, are
always be&s;t overlooked: and when &s;he appears as lady
Audley, it will be nobody's bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire how
it came about. Provoked as I was at the gro&s;s man|ner
in which Mr. B&mdash;delivered him&s;elf, and &s;till
more at his daring &s;ugge&s;tions, I yet endeavoured to
pre&s;erve my temper; and too much flattered by the
hitt he had thrown out, pardon me, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Ar|nold,
if for a minute I pre&s;umed to entertain a hope
upon which I dare not now enlarge. I contented my|&s;elf,
however, with replying, that I &s;hould think my|&s;elf
but too happy to give my name to Mi&s;s Arnold,
let that event be brought about by what means it
<PB N="66" REF="241">
would. Then addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to lady Sarah, I will
not, madam, &s;aid I, take upon me to explain the mo|tives
of the lady's conduct, which however &s;trange it
may appear, I dare venture to &s;ay, &s;he will be able to
ju&s;tify. Riddle me, riddle me ree cried Mr. B&mdash;;
but how, in the name of wonder, came Mi&s;s Arnold
to put her&s;elf under <HI>your</HI> care, Sir Edward? And how
came it, &s;ir, rejoined lady Sarah, that you did not
acquaint her family la&s;t night with her &s;ituation?
Perhaps, interpo&s;ed Mrs. B&mdash;, Sir Edward knew not
of it till this morning. Yes, madam, replied I, and
your &s;ervants have been carele&s;s in not informing you
that I was at your door la&s;t night; when being told
that you were not to be &s;een, I was obliged to defer
the account I had to give you till this morning. As
for the two que&s;tions which lady Sarah and Mr. B&mdash;
have demanded, I mu&s;t leave it to Mi&s;s Arnold her&s;elf
to &s;atisfy them. It is a mo&s;t unaccountable affair, &s;aid
lady Sarah. I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir, that lady Audley and your
&s;i&s;ter are with her. Neither one nor the other, ma|dam;
unluckily they are both now out of town. Gra|cious!
exclaimed lady Sarah, and has the girl pa&s;&s;ed
the whole night in a lonely hou&s;e, without any one in
it but &s;ervants? You cannot think Sir Edward &s;o inat|tentive
as that comes to, replied Mr. B&mdash;, with a &s;neer,
which indicated a meaning too injurious not to rouze
my utmo&s;t re&s;entment; but my tender regard to your
reputation making me fearful of a quarrel, I &s;eemed
not to have attended to him, and only replied to lady
Sarah, that you were in the hands of very worthy and
&s;ober people, who, I was &s;ure, would not be wanting
in the utmo&s;t care and re&s;pect. Then a&s;king Mrs.
B&mdash;if &s;he thought her health would permit her to
pay you the de&s;ired vi&s;it, as you were not in a conditi|on
to be removed, &s;he replied, 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, Sir
Edward; I have had a fever on me the whole night,
and find my&s;elf unable to li&s;t my head from my pi|llow;
otherwi&s;e you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf nothing
&s;hould hinder me from &s;eeing the poor child. But
you, lady Sarah, I make no doubt, will think it ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to go to her immediately. <HI>By no
<PB N="67" REF="242">
means,</HI> was her cold and peremptory reply. I expect
Sir George in town to-morrow night; he is the pro|pere&s;t
per&s;on to enquire into this bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Will you
in the mean while, madam&punc; &s;end &s;ome one you can
tru&s;t to vi&s;it her? &s;aid I; your own woman? I am &s;o
far of Mr. B's mind, an&s;wered &s;he, that I think the
le&s;s noi&s;e there is made about this wretched affair the
better. There is no tru&s;ting to the di&s;cretion of &s;er|vants;
they very often betray &s;ecrets, only to let peo|ple
&s;ee they are tru&s;ted. A plea&s;ant entertainment it
would be to the town to hear that <HI>my</HI> niece was found
in a little lodging-hou&s;e at Brumpton! for there is not
a living creature but knows of her being gone off
&s;omewhere in a hackney-coach. It &s;eems, madam,
that lady Sarah di&s;covered this circum&s;tance by having
traced you to a milliner's at who&s;e &s;hop you had been
ye&s;terday. (You mu&s;t know, Falkland, that Mi&s;s
Arnold her&s;elf had related this particular, when in
endeavouring to prevail on my women to let her go,
&s;he had, by way of proving the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was un|der
of returning home, told them of the &s;hifts &s;he had
been obliged to u&s;e in getting to Brumpton unknown
to her family.) And my people, continued lady Sarah,
have been to enquire for her at every hou&s;e in London
where I vi&s;it; &s;o that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>me</HI> ever
to think of taking her home again, were &s;he even in|clined
to return.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. B&mdash;&s;ighed, and, &s;eeminly fatigued with
the length of our conver&s;ation, I know not what to
make of this unhappy affair, &s;aid &s;he; but I will &s;u&s;|pend
all judgment till I hear what Mi&s;s Arnold has to
&s;ay for her&s;elf. Mean while let me beg of you, Sir
Edward, that lady Audley or your &s;i&s;ter may be &s;ent
for to be with her. Poh, poh, &s;aid Mr. B&mdash;, the
&s;horte&s;t way, Sir, Edward, will be to trundle her
down to Oxford&s;hire, and a&s;k ble&s;&s;ing of the good
lady her mother. Mrs. Arnold is in a complying hu|mour.
Why not accept of you for a &s;on-in-law as
well as Falkland? I conde&s;cended not to an&s;wer Mr.
B&mdash;'s ill-timed plea&s;antry; but applying my&s;elf to his
lady, Then, madam, you do not give me any thing
<PB N="68" REF="243">
in commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ay to Mi&s;s Arnold? Tell her from
me, &s;aid Mrs. B&mdash;, that nothing &s;hall prevent my go|ing
to her the moment I am able to leave my bed.
And tell her from <HI>me,</HI> rejoined lady Sarah, that &s;he
may expect a vi&s;it from her uncle as &s;oon as he comes
to town. If &s;he can &s;atisfy <HI>him</HI> with regard to her
conduct, I fancy the re&s;t of her friends will excu&s;e her;
mean while, I think her character cannot &s;uffer more
by pa&s;&s;ing <HI>two</HI> nights under the protection &s;he has
cho&s;en, than it probably has done by &s;taying one.
That matter is &s;ettled then, &s;aid Mr. B&mdash;, ri&s;ing off
his chair, as if to put me in mind of retiring. I took
the hint, and immediately withdrew, mortified to
death at the unfortunate &s;ucce&s;s of my emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>What think you of this little hi&s;tory, Falkland?
Was it not well conceived? and have I not made the
per&s;onages talk and act in character? Oh, I know
them all; and you know I have a knack at entering
into the &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e I would
repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I would not break the thread of my narration to tell
you Mi&s;s Arnold's comments, which were many,
during my recital. But when I came to that part of
it, <HI>Tell her &s;he may expect a vi&s;it from her uncle as &s;oon
at he comes to town!</HI> &s;he clapped her hands together;
Then I am undone! &s;aid &s;he. Oh, Sir Edward, what
have you brought me to! Had you &s;uffered me to
have gone home ye&s;terday, all this might have been
&s;aved; it were better I had died a thou&s;and times
than live to be expo&s;ed to &s;o much &s;hame! Forgive
me, dear madam, &s;aid I, I meant all for the be&s;t, tho'
my zeal for you has unfortunately produced &s;uch ill
effects. I am, upon your account as much alarmed
as you are at the thoughts of this threatened vi&s;it from
Sir George Bidulph; yet how can we prevent it? He
comes, &s;aid &s;he, wringing her hands, armed with the
terrors of a judge, to examine the poor little crimi|nal!
he finds her in an ob&s;cure hou&s;e out of town&mdash;
True, madam, (interrupting her) and under the im|mediate
protection of a man whom, next to Falkland,
be mo&s;t hates; not a &s;oul with you but people whom
<PB N="69" REF="244">
that very man had placed about you; how are we to
account for all this? (Ob&s;erve the <HI>we,</HI> Falkland; you
&s;ee I made my&s;elf a party.) Mu&s;t I undergo the
mortification, &s;aid &s;he, of di&s;clo&s;ing all my di&s;grace,
and that to a <HI>man</HI> too? a &s;evere and vindictive relati|on,
from whom I can expect nothing but reproaches!
no kind friend to mediate or throw in a &s;oftening word
in extenuation of my fault!&mdash;Oh, Sir Edward, I
cannot &s;tand this dreadful interview.</P>
<P>At all events, madam, &s;aid J, Sir George Bidulph
mu&s;t not &s;ee you. His impetuo&s;ity might be fatal to
you in the weak condition in which you now are.
Let <HI>me</HI> &s;tand the brunt of his re&s;entment. I care not
for his anger; or at wor&s;t&mdash;I am ready to &s;acrifice my
life for you. She knew too well the tendency of my
words, the frightful image of a quarrel between her
uncle and me, ending perhaps in a duel, ru&s;hed at
once upon her imagination. Let me go, cried &s;he,
let me hide my&s;elf where I may never be heard of
more! Oh, Sir Edward, what mi&s;eries have you
brought on me! Why did not you let me go ye&s;ter|day?
What recompence can you make me for the lo&s;s
of friends and character? Was life to be put in com|petition
with them? This was the very &s;ubject which
I wi&s;hed &s;hould get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and I was
re&s;olved to make it operate with its full force. Let me
conjure you, madam, not to afflict your&s;elf with need|le&s;s
apprehen&s;ions; your friends, I hope, will be in
time appea&s;ed; and for your character, there <HI>is</HI> a way,
if I dur&s;t pre&s;ume to name it, by which it might be
&s;ecured from the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of reproach.&mdash;
I &s;topped here, as if afraid to proceed&mdash;No, no, &s;ir,
nothing but the grave can &s;creen <HI>me</HI> from reproach.&mdash;
Dear Mi&s;s Arnold, permit me to tell you, that you
<HI>have</HI> a re&s;ource, not, I hope, &s;o de&s;perate, &s;o hateful
to you, as that which you mention. What is it, &s;ir?
for I know of none. To give the man who has un|fortunately
been the cau&s;e of having your character
called in que&s;tion, a legal right to defend it at his
own. (Was not this hinted with as much delicacy as
lord V&mdash;him&s;elf could have done it?) Oh, Sir Ed|ward,
<PB N="70" REF="245">
is <HI>this</HI> a time?&mdash;I interrupted her; I grant
you, it is not, madam; and I &s;hould have too much
re&s;pect for your well-founded grief to make &s;uch a
propo&s;al, if I did not think it the only means to obviate
what I at lea&s;t flatter my&s;elf is the principal cau&s;e of
it. Your friends already &s;u&s;pect that I am particularly
intere&s;ted in the unfortunate &s;tep you have taken. The
manner of your coming hither, of which they are, as
I told you before, thoroughly apprized, has all the ap|pearance
of a premeditated flight on your &s;ide. How
are you then to explain this part of your conduct?
Do you think, madam, it will be con&s;idered as a
greater crime by your friends to return <HI>my</HI> love than
that of the ungrateful Falkland? Oh, Sir Edward,
what have you led me into? you have completed my
de&s;truction!&mdash;Let me be&s;eech you, madam, to con|&s;ider
a little how extremely critical your &s;ituation is.
What will be the con&s;equence of your confe&s;&s;ing the
truth? You doom to de&s;pair the unhappy man who
implores your pity and forgivene&s;s&mdash;Oh, not for
the univer&s;e, &s;he cried; I would die rather than &s;ee
him unhappy! You plant a dagger in your poor
Cecilia's heart, and ruin the peace of your whole
family! She breathed a deep &s;igh, &s;triking her hands
gently on the counterpane of her bed. Then, madam,
think how you are to excu&s;e your&s;elf. Will the in|tention
be deemed le&s;s faulty than the act? It was to
Falkland's infidelity, not to Mi&s;s Arnold's awakened
duty, that her family are indebted for her late ac|knowlegement
of her error. Sir, the thought is e|nough
to turn one's brain! I am not able to &s;upport it.
This is all your doing, Sir Edward; if you had &s;uf|fered
me to have gone&mdash;I acknowlege it, madam,
and would die to repair my mi&s;take, if that would do
it&mdash;Let me go, &s;ir, (looking on each &s;ide the bed, as
if for her cloaths) let me fly to my mama; &s;he'll ad|vi&s;e
me, &s;he'll give me &s;ome comfort in my mi&s;ery.
Madam, I will not oppo&s;e your will, you &s;hall have
my chariot, when you plea&s;e, to convey you home;
but have you determined what conduct you are to
hold with regard to Mr. Falkland and your &s;i&s;ter, &s;up|po&s;ing
<PB N="71" REF="246">
even we &s;hould be able to form &s;ome pretence
for your having come hither? I will not &s;ay a word,
&s;aid &s;he, which can prevent their marriage; no, no, I
love them both too well to di&s;turb their happine&s;s,
Charming generous creature! &s;aid I; then you will
probably, in a few days, be a witne&s;s to the joyful
nuptials of the happy Falkland. Oh, that's too much,
&s;aid &s;he, I did not think of it before. I cannot be a
<HI>witne&s;s</HI> to them. Lord! what &s;hall I do? I tell you
again Sir Edward, my head is almo&s;t turned, and I
am &s;ure I &s;hould not pre&s;erve my &s;en&s;es if I were to
&s;ee my uncle. You &s;hall not &s;ee him, madam; nei|ther
do I think it advi&s;eable for you to tru&s;t to the
&s;trength of your own re&s;olution in being pre&s;ent at your
&s;i&s;ter's marriage, which mu&s;t unavoidably be the ca&s;e
if you go down to Oxford&s;hire. Suppo&s;e, in&s;tead of
a journey thither, you were to retire to &s;ome friend's
hou&s;e, and wait there till after Mr. Falkland's de|parture
from England, which will take place immedi|ately
after his marriage. You will, in the interim,
have time to con&s;ider of what is be&s;t to be done to ex|tricate
your&s;elf from the difficulties in which you are
entangled. I am &s;orry, added I, that neither my
mother nor my &s;i&s;ter are in town, as it prevents me
from offering you their hou&s;e as an a&s;ylum. I thank
you, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, but I will go to Mrs. B&mdash;'s; &s;he
is the woman in the world whom, next to my mama,
I mo&s;t revere. I am extremely mortified, my dear
Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid I, that I am now under a nece&s;&s;ity
of telling you what for fear of giving you pain, I cho&s;e
before to conceal; but I doubt it will be impo&s;&s;ible
for you to be at Mrs, B&mdash;'s.&mdash;Mercy on me!
why &s;o, Sir Edward? I am &s;ure Mrs. B&mdash;loves me,
and would do any thing to &s;erve me. I am &s;atisfied
of <HI>her</HI> kind intentions, replied I, but can you an&s;wer
for tho&s;e of her hu&s;band? I know he is a rough man,
&s;aid Mi&s;s Arnold; yet I think he would not hinder
his $word$ from giving &s;helter to a poor unfortunate crea|tu$e,
who has no other friend to whom &s;he can fly.
You judge too favourably of him, an&s;wered, I; for
$hen his lady was lamenting that it was not in her
<PB N="72" REF="247">
power to attend you on account of her illne&s;s, he e$|plied,
You need not make your&s;elf unea&s;y about that,
Mrs. B&mdash;; for were you even able to go, I &s;hould by
no means approve of your interfering in a bu&s;ine&s;s of
this nature. Leave the lady to the conduct of her
own relations; and let me reque&s;t it of you, not to
interpo&s;e one way or other. You may judge by this,
madam, whether Mr. B&mdash;'s doors are likely to be
open to you. What will become of me! cried &s;he.
I have then no re&s;ource left&mdash;Oh, Sir Edward Aud|ley,
into what an aby&s;s have you plunged me!&mdash;
I will &s;end for my mother and my &s;i&s;ter directly, ma|dam,
they are only at Hampton-Court; they can ea|&s;ily
be in town to-night. I am &s;ure they will joyfully
receive you. Mrs. Arnold has a great regard for lady
Audley; &s;he can have no objection to your being with
her&mdash;True, &s;ir; but <HI>why</HI> am I to be with lady Aud|ley?
Why not go home to my mama? What rea&s;on
can I offer for that? That your health would not per|mit
you to take the journey; and finding Mr. B&mdash;'s
doors &s;hut again&s;t you, and that you had incurred the
re&s;entment of lady Sarah, you had no other alterna|tive.
&mdash;And here a thought has ju&s;t &s;truck me, by
which you may very naturally account for your com|ing
hither in the private manner that you did. You
know your uncle Bidulph has thought proper to forbid
any connection between you and my family, at the
&s;ame time that neither he nor lady Sarah are &s;trangers
to the friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between you and my
&s;i&s;ter. Now, madam, why may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed
that you had been prevailed on, from the love you bear
Mi&s;s Audley, at her earne&s;t reque&s;t, to meet her here?
The fear of having a thing (interdicted by Sir George)
di&s;covered, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the precautions of
which you made u&s;e; and the &s;udden and violent
illne&s;s which attacked you here rendering it impo&s;&s;ible
to be concealed, obliged you to have recour&s;e to Mrs.
B&mdash;, as you had not the courage to apply to lady
Sarah her&s;elf, after &s;uch a$palpable breach of your
uncle's commands. We may leave it to Sophy,
continued I, &s;miling, to frame an excu&s;e for her
<PB N="73" REF="248">
having de&s;ired to &s;ee you in this clande&s;tine manner.
Perhaps a &s;tolen wedding was intended, to which you
were to have been a witne&s;s; and which I happening
to di&s;cover, prevented, and &s;ent my &s;i&s;ter directly into
the country. I dare &s;ay &s;he will not &s;cruple at invent|ing
an innocent tale for your &s;ervice; and if you will,
for once, conde&s;cend to give your &s;ufferage to a &s;light
deviation from fact, in order to prevent &s;uch compli|cated
mi&s;chiefs as a di&s;covery of the real &s;tate of the
ca&s;e would produce, I think there will be no difficulty
in gaining credit to &s;o plau&s;ible an account.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Falkland, with what cautious terms I dre&s;|&s;ed
the fal&s;hood that I was &s;ugge&s;ting to her, and how
much I avoided, giving it the appearance of a lye, that
terrible naughty thing, which being the &s;ingle crime
that little children can commit, the avoiding; it is the
fir&s;t moral principle that is inculcated into them, and
which &s;ometimes &s;ticks by them their whole lives; as
was the ca&s;e with Mi&s;s Arnold; for, notwith&s;tanding
all my gilding and varni&s;hing, &s;he di&s;covered the face
of the ugly phantom.&mdash;Lord, &s;aid &s;he, what, a de&s;pi|cable
creature have I made my&s;elf, to be reduced thus
to &s;uch mean &s;hifts! My dear madam, of two evils we
mu&s;t always chu&s;e the lea&s;t. True, &s;aid &s;he, yet were
<HI>I</HI> only to be the &s;ufferer, I would not &s;ubmit to the
telling a fal&s;hood; but when I think of&mdash;
She &s;topped &s;hort, &s;triking her forehead with one of
her hands.&mdash;Oh, Lear, Lear, whi&s;pered I to my&s;elf,
beat at this gate that let the folly in, &amp;c. Well, ma|dam,
I think we have at length found an harmle&s;s ex|pedient,
by which we may be delivered from our dif|ficulties.
I will immediately di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to
Hampton-court to reque&s;t the pre&s;ence of the two
ladies in town to night. Mean while let me conjure
you to endeavor to take a little repo&s;e, I am &s;ure you
&s;tand in need of it; you may depend on &s;eeing my
mother and &s;i&s;ter by &s;upper-time. I was going to
leave the room. Hold, Sir! cried &s;he: you may &s;ave
your&s;elf the trouble of writing to lady Audley, and
her the inconvenience of hurrying to town, for I am
now determined to go home to my mama. Since I am
<PB N="74" REF="249">
reduced &s;o low as to be under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of
telling a fal&s;hood, I may as well do it at once without
aggravating my fault by ab&s;enting my&s;elf longer from
my family, and expo&s;ing my character to any farther
cen&s;ures. I know the wor&s;t that can befall me at
home, and will try to &s;upport it; therefore, if you
would oblige me, furni&s;h me with the means of get|ting
immediately to Woodberry; I am able enough to
undertake the journey; I would &s;et out directly.&mdash;</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t what I expected. I had for this very
purpo&s;e furni&s;hed her with a plau&s;ible tale, of which,
&s;pite of her love of truth, I knew &s;he would make
u&s;e, rather than continue any longer in a &s;ituation
which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was not the mo&s;t e|ligible.
You will a&s;k perhaps, why I did not take her
at her word, and under pretence of &s;ending her to
Woodbery, lay hold of this opportunity of conveying
her to Bag&s;hot? I'll tell you, becau&s;e I knew I could
do it as well to-morrow, or even the next day. And
you are to ob&s;erve that as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould find her|&s;elf
carried to a different place from that where &s;he ex|pected
to go, I mu&s;t drop the ma&s;k at once, and I
think it more for my intere&s;t to wear it a little longer.
I hope to make a &s;ort of merit with her of my re&s;pect|ful
and di&s;tant behaviour during the time I have had
her &s;o intirely in my power. A merit, let me tell
you, not to be overlooked in a man &s;o <HI>de&s;perately</HI> in
love as I am. And then my running away with her
was not a premeditated &s;cheme; no, no, it was &s;ud|denly
&s;ugge&s;ted to me by the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion,
on finding her determined to put her&s;elf into the hands
of a family from whom I could expect no quarter.
This you &s;ee &s;oftens the tre&s;pa&s;s down to a mere love
tran&s;port, and will much &s;ooner obtain forgivene&s;s than
could po&s;&s;ibly be expected for a concerted &s;cheme. So
that, in &s;hort, I now begin to think I &s;hall have le&s;s
difficulty to prevail with her than I at fir&s;t apprehend|ed.
By the bye, &s;he has been extremely courteous to
me, and expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf very thankfully for all the
trouble I have taken to &s;erve her.</P>
<P>You are not to wonder then, that I endeavoured to
<PB N="75" REF="250">
turn her from her de&s;ign of &s;etting out directly, as &s;he
&s;aid &s;he would for Oxford&s;hire. I would not for the
whole earth, madam, &s;aid I, di&s;pute your plea&s;ure in
any thing; but let me conjure you to have a little more
regard to your health than to think of undertaking
&s;uch a journey, till you have at lea&s;t, by one night's
repo&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure recruited your &s;trength.
The women who attend you, tell me you &s;lept not
la&s;t night, you have taken no refre&s;hment &s;ince you
have been here, you mu&s;t be extremely feeble; let me
prevail with you&mdash;She interrupted me, Sir, I find my|&s;elf
much better than I was; I am not indeed quite
well, yet I think I am &s;trong enough to undertake &s;uch
a little journey. You will much oblige me if you will
furni&s;h me with the means of &s;etting out immedi|ately.
&mdash;But, madam, con&s;ider, Sir George Bidulph is
&s;till at Woodberry; your &s;udden appearance there, as
it mu&s;t &s;urprize him extremely, &s;o mu&s;t it put him
upon enquiring into the motives of it, and force you
into di&s;agreeable explanations.&mdash;This &s;eemed to &s;tartle
her; I would not wi&s;h to meet my uncle, &s;aid &s;he,
yet he will hear the whole affair from lady Sarah as
&s;oon as he comes to town, and in how terrible a light
mu&s;t I appear till he has it explained! Leave it to your
mama, &s;aid I, to explain it to him; Mrs. Arnold will
hear you with indulgence, and repre&s;ent the &s;tory in
the tendere&s;t manner to Sir George. I had much ra|ther
it were &s;o, replied &s;he. Yet the &s;taying in this
hou&s;e another night, with ab&s;olute &s;trangers&mdash;'tis &s;o
improper, &s;o imprudent! better ri&s;que any thing.&mdash;I
put her in mind of what lady Sarah had &s;aid, that her
character would not receive any more injury (in ca&s;e
even of the affair's being known) by &s;taying two than
one night in the place where &s;he then was.&mdash;She &s;eemed
half inclined, yet loath to yield; when lifting her
mode&s;t eyes to my face, I &s;hall be permitted then, Sir,
&s;aid &s;he, to remain here with no other company but the
two gentlewomen of the hou&s;e? I under&s;tood her
meaning; Undoubtedly, madam, replied I, I &s;hall re|turn
to town directly. I would not for the world alarm
you by my pre&s;ence. And to-morrow you will be &s;o
<PB N="76" REF="251">
good as to let me have your chariot, Sir? Certainly,
madam.&mdash;I retired immediately; but in&s;tead of going
to London, only withdrew into another chamber,
where I &s;ate me down to give you this farther account
of my proceedings. I mean not to leave the hou&s;e to|night,
for I would have it <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> that I have not
lain at home, &s;ince the day of elopement.</P>
<P>I intended to have &s;ent this off to you to-night, but
upon &s;econd thoughts will defer it till to-morrow, when
I may have &s;omething farther worth communicating to
you. I am ju&s;t now told that the lady is ri&s;en, and
has reque&s;ted a di&s;h of tea, which is the fir&s;t nouri&s;h|ment
the perver&s;e beauty would receive, as &s;he has only
been prevailed on &s;ince ye&s;terday noon to wet her lips
once or twice with a little wine and water.</P>
<P><DATE>March 16th.</DATE></P>
<P>We have ju&s;t had the prettie&s;t altercation imagina|ble,
but it is all blown over, and we are now the be&s;t
friends in the world. The lady ro&s;e at eight o'clock this
morning, though as the dam&s;el, who lay on a pallet by
her, informed me, &s;he &s;lept very little more la&s;t night
than &s;he had done the night before. Her fir&s;t enquiry
was, whether the chariot was arrived? She was an|&s;wered,
No. She complained, was fullen, and would
eat no breakfa&s;t; a common practice it is with ladies,
when they are vexed, to fa&s;t out of &s;pite. I heard
her (for I was in the chamber adjoining to her's) tra|ver&s;ing
her room all the morning; then &s;peaking to
the women who were with her. 'Twas very hard, &s;he
&s;aid; &s;ure Sir Edward Audley would not break his
word with her! By no means, my dear creature, whi&s;|pered
I to my&s;elf; but you mu&s;t neverthele&s;s re&s;train
your impatience, for it is not at all convenient that you
&s;hould &s;et out &s;o early. About twelve o'clock I &s;ent
up to de&s;ire permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;k her how &s;he did; and
was immediately admitted. Her countenance cleared
up when &s;he &s;aw me. Oh, Sir Edward, I was afraid
you had quite forgot me! I enquired after her health.
She &s;carce allowed her&s;elf time to an&s;wer me&mdash;Is the
<PB N="77" REF="252">
chariot come, Sir? for I have been ready the&s;e three
hours. I am rejoiced to &s;ee you &s;o much better, ma|dam;
but to tell you the truth, I &s;o little expected to
find you &s;o well recovered, that I would not order the
chariot till I fir&s;t knew whether you were in a conditi|tion
to travel&mdash;Ble&s;s me, Sir, how can you di&s;ap|point
one &s;o! I am very well, extremely well. What
carriage brought you down hither? I'll take <HI>any</HI> ve|hicle
&mdash;I care not what it is. Madam, I rid; I gene|rally
take a ride every morning. (I was booted.) Well,
Sir, let me be&s;eech you, it you <HI>mean</HI> to favour me
with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to let your &s;ervant go to town di|rectly
and order down your chariot, or hire me ano|ther
coach. I will go my&s;elf, madam; I am now re|turning
home, I did not think it had been &s;o late; but
a circum&s;tance has occurred to my thoughts this morn|ing,
which makes me wi&s;h you would defer your jour|ney
for to-day.&mdash;Indeed, Sir, I will not defer it&mdash;
(rather in a peevi&s;h tone for &s;o gentle a creature) Ma|dam,
I pre&s;ume not to dictate to you; but I would
ju&s;t remind you that as your uncle Bidulph is expected
in town to-night, &s;hould you &s;et out for Oxford&s;hire,
'tis highly probable you may meet him on the road;
and how di&s;agreeable &s;uch a rencounter would be to
you, is worth your con&s;ideration.&mdash;I would not meet
him on any account, &s;aid &s;he; yet if the windows of
my carriage are drawn up, I think there will be no
difficulty in concealing my&s;elf. Do not tru&s;t to that,
madam; you know you mu&s;t &s;top on the road, you
may happen even at the &s;ame inn to pop on each other.
What would Sir George think of &s;uch a flight? for
though he may not yet be apprized of what has hap|pened,
yet the &s;eeing me with you&mdash;She took me
up &s;hort; Sir, there is no nece&s;&s;ity for that; I &s;hall
think my&s;elf &s;ufficiently obliged to you for one of your
&s;ervants to conduct me home. I found by this, the
ungrateful little gip&s;ey, notwith&s;tanding all my kind|ne&s;s
to her, had no thoughts of making me any re|turn;
but I was prepared for this refu&s;al. I &s;ee, ma|dam,
&s;aid I, how unacceptable all my &s;ervices are to
you; that &s;hall not, however, prevent my doing my
<PB N="78" REF="253">
utmo&s;t to oblige you. I go, madam, to fulfil your or|ders.
My chariot &s;hall attend you; it probably can|not
be with you in le&s;s than about a couple of hours;
but be under no anixety. You mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;leep
on the road to-night; I &s;uppo&s;e it will be a matter of
indifference to you whether you lie twenty or thirty
miles out of town. 'Tis quite equal to me. &s;aid &s;he;
yet had you been &s;o good as to have let me depart early
this morning, I might have &s;lept at Woodberry to|night.
I begged pardon for my omi&s;&s;ion, and as a
farther precaution to hide her&s;elf from Sir George Bi|dulph's
&s;ight, I recommended it to her not to alight out
of the chariot when the hor&s;es came to be changed.
She &s;aid &s;he would not alight till &s;he came to the inn
where &s;he was to lie; and thanked me for the hint, the
the intention of which I believe I not explain to you.</P>
<P>Thus having re&s;tored tranquillity to the brea&s;t of
my fair, I withdrew; but in&s;tead of going to town
my&s;elf, I di&s;patched my imp to order the chariot down
at <HI>three</HI> o'clock, and not before; this will co&s;t us an|other
hour of fretting, but no matter: Charmer, thou
mu&s;t bear greater di&s;appointments than that; I have
directed at the &s;ame time my &s;i&s;ter's maid to make up a
little packet of her young lady's linen, and &s;ome other
nece&s;&s;aries, and put them into the coach box; &s;ee how
provident I am, Falkland.</P>
<P>You will de&s;ire to know perhaps how I meant to act
in ca&s;e Mi&s;s Arnold had con&s;ented to have gone to my
mother's hou&s;e? Why, ju&s;t as I mean now to act. I
did not lie awake &s;pinning &s;uch flimzy toils as were to
be bru&s;hed away by the white finger of a baby. My
mother was to have been very ill, not able to come to
town, and alarmed to the la&s;t degree at the thoughts
of how much a young creature's character might &s;uf|fer
by being alone under the care of a giddy boy like
me. She conjures her to come down directly to Hamp|ton-court,
where her cou&s;in Batemans would be re|joiced
to receive her. She &s;ets out for this purpo&s;e,
and then the bu&s;ine&s;s is done, let me but get her out of
London in a vehicle of which I govern the motions.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="254">
You are to ob&s;erve, that never having but once
gone the road from Oxford to London, &s;he nows kno|thing
of the geography of the country. Be&s;ides, the
fear of meeting our uncle Bidulph will make her afraid
to peep her no&s;e out. The hor&s;es are to be changed
at Houn&s;low; but as &s;he &s;ets out with mine, and a
good coachman, you know, having too much regard
to his ma&s;ter's cattle to drive them like po&s;t-hor&s;es, &s;he
mu&s;t be content to go to the fir&s;t ten or dozen miles at
a very moderate pace; after which, as ill luck would
have it, one of the fore wheels failing, we are all of a
&s;udden obliged to &s;top; by this time, by my calculati|on,
it will be near dark; the footman, or coachman, no
matter which, &s;teps into a gentleman's hou&s;e before
who&s;e door the accident happened, to get a hammer
and nails, carele&s;s blockhead as he is to forget &s;uch
nece&s;&s;ary implements on a journey. This is the cue for
Harry Bendi&s;h (at who&s;e hou&s;e David has arrived be|fore
this pre&s;ent writing) to make his appearance. He
entreats the the lady to &s;tep in whil&s;t her chariot is re|pairing.
The coachman having by this time dexter|ou&s;ly
applied the hammer, the wheel is in <HI>reality</HI> put
out of condition of rolling, and the lady reduced to
the nece&s;&s;ity of accepting, of a bed at this ho&s;pitable
gentleman's hou&s;e. And where is Audley to be all
this while? why, on hor&s;e back, clo&s;e upon the track
of the chariot; and as &s;oon as his prey is hou&s;ed, as if
touched with the &s;pear of Ithuriel, he &s;tarts up in his
own proper &s;hape&mdash;</P>
<P>Bravi&s;&s;imo, the chariot is this minute arrived; I am
&s;uppo&s;ed to have come down in it in order to bid Mi&s;s
Arnold adieu.&mdash;Farewel, inexorable fair; but&mdash;
I'll met thee at Philippi.&mdash;</P>

<OPENER>Sir GEORGE BIDULPH to Mrs. ARNOLD.
Dear Sidney,
<DATELINE>London, <DATE>March 17th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have ju&s;t di&s;covered in what manner your daugh|ter
has di&s;po&s;ed of her&s;elf, and &s;uppo&s;e it will a|maze
you as much as it has done me, when I tell you
&s;he has thought proper to make choice of Sir Edward
Audley. The gentleman, I pre&s;ume, finding him&s;elf
unacceptable to one &s;i&s;ter, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with bet|ter
&s;ucce&s;s to the other. This, as lady Sarah ob&s;erves,
is the con&s;equence of that weak indulgence which has
been &s;hewn to Cecilia. The&s;e events have overturned
all my views, and I find I am to look for heirs <HI>out</HI> of my
own family.</P>
<P>From the lights, that had been got before my arrival
in town, Mr. B&mdash;judged that the &s;horte&s;t way to
come at the di&s;covery of this affair, would be by ad|verti&s;ement
to offer a reward to the coachman who
carried a young lady on &s;uch a day and hour from &s;uch
a place; and accordingly, at lady Sarah's de&s;ire, he
put &s;uch an adverti&s;ement into all the papers ye&s;terday.
The fellow came to me this morning, and declared he
had carried the lady &s;o de&s;cribed to Spring-garden pa&s;|&s;age,
where &s;he alighted and walked towards the Park;
but that he knew no more of her. With this un&s;ati&s;|factory
account, I own I &s;hould have been put off;
when lord V&mdash;, who very luckily happened to be with
me, and who&s;e thoughts were more di&s;engaged than
mine, &s;u&s;pecting the fellow did not &s;peak truth, pro|po&s;ed
bringing him before a magi&s;trate. The man
&s;eemed frightened and unwilling to go; which con|firming
my lord in his &s;u&s;picions, we threatened &s;ending
him to pri&s;on. Upon which he acknowleged that he
had carried the lady to a hou&s;e at Brumpton, which he
&s;aid he was ready to &s;hew us; where, after having &s;et
her down, a gentleman whom he did not then know,
but whom he found afterwards to be Sir Edward Aud|ley,
<PB N="81" REF="256">
came in his coach to town; that he drove him to
his hou&s;e in Bond-&s;treet, where he gave him five gui|neas,
with a &s;trict charge, in ca&s;e of enquiry, not to
own that he had carried &s;uch a lady, threatening to be
the death of him if he di&s;obeyed him. Having &s;ecur|ed
the man till farther enquiry, I went immediately to
lady Audley's hou&s;e, where I was informed that &s;he
and her daughter had been at Hampton-Court for the&s;e
ten days pa&s;t. As for Sir Edward, the &s;ervants could
give no account of him, but that he had been out of
town &s;ince Thur&s;day; but where they knew not. Not
being able, to obtain any farther information from them.
I drove to Brumpton; here I had the my&s;tery explain|ed
by the old beldam who keeps the hou&s;e. She &s;aid
Sir Edward Audley had lodgings in her hou&s;e, which
he kept the year round; and where, being but a <HI>puny</HI>
gentleman, he &s;ometimes lay for his health. That on
Thur&s;day a young lady had met him, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;|ed
was either his wife or his <HI>&s;weetheart;</HI> but that it
was none of her bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. That they pa&s;&s;ed
the whole day together; and that the lady had lain
there that night. I a&s;ked if Sir Edward had &s;lept with
her; the a&s;&s;ured me that he did not, the lady having
been &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed that her daughter had been o|bliged
to &s;it up with her all night, and that Sir Edward
had lain in another chamber; but that the next day
they both went away together in Sir Edward's chariot;
but to what place &s;he could not &s;ay. I a&s;ked her &s;e|veral
que&s;tions to try if I could entrap her in her an|&s;wers;
but &s;he replied readily, and with &s;eeming truth,
to all my interrogations; and concluded with declaring
&s;olemnly &s;he knew not who the lady was; but that &s;he
made no doubt but that &s;he either was, or would be
married to his <HI>honour.</HI> This is the &s;um of what I have
heen able to gather; and as I concluded with my land|lady
of Brumpton, that the lady <HI>is</HI> by this time mar|ried
to his honour, I do not mean to give my&s;elf any
farther pain about her. As for your daughter Cecilia,
I have nothing more to &s;ay, than as you are entirely at
liberty with regard to the <HI>time</HI> of her nuptials, I am
only commi&s;&s;ioned from lady Sarah to tell you, that
<PB N="82" REF="257">
&s;he begs to be excu&s;ed from being pre&s;ent at them; and
I mu&s;t reque&s;t the &s;ame favour with regard to my|&s;elf.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &amp;c.
P. S. Though &s;uch di&s;agreeable news as this letter
contains would reach you full &s;oon enough by the
po&s;t, yet to put an end to &s;o uncomfortable a &s;tate

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mr. FALKLAND to Sir EDWARD AUDLEY.
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>March 17th,</DATE>
eight o'clock at night.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not been compo&s;ed enough to write to you,
Audley, till this day. My thoughts have been all
tumult. Your exploit, as you may well imagine, threw
all the family into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. Lady
Sarah's account reached them but twelve hours later
than your's did me; for though &s;he writ not till the
day after Mi&s;s Arnold's departure, &s;he tru&s;ted not to the
conveyance of the po&s;t. My Cecilia was drowned in
tears; Mrs. Arnold almo&s;t &s;tupified with grief; the
good old Price lifting up his hands and eyes in a&s;toni&s;h|ment;
Sir George Bidulph execrating the art and di&s;|&s;imulation
of women, and muttering ungrateful hints
to poor Cecilia. I, traitor as I am, &s;eeming&mdash;
no, Audley, not <HI>&s;eeming;</HI> but really taking part in the
general unea&s;ine&s;s; and lord V&mdash;. (What a &s;lave am
I in compari&s;on of that man!) endeavouring to con&s;ole
us all. Sir George and his lord&s;hip &s;et out for London
the next morning, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover the
bottom of this dark affair, not one of them being able
to form a &s;ingle conjecture which could throw the lea&s;t
light on it. What a dreadful interval have I endured
<PB N="83" REF="258">
from the time of Sir George's quitting us till now! I
would not for millions pa&s;s eight and forty hours more
in the &s;ame manner. You are to know, that &s;ince my
la&s;t to you I had pleaded my cau&s;e &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that
I had prevailed on Cecilia to con&s;ent to our marriage
before my departure. Mr. Price, who is ever on his
pupil's &s;ide, had worked on Mrs. Arnold. Lord V&mdash;
was &s;o generous as to join them both, and they had all
together &s;o wrought on Sir George Bidulph, that he at
la&s;t con&s;ented, provided we were married privately, and
the affair kept &s;ecret till my return; when it was pro|po&s;ed
to procure for me &s;uch a rank in the army, as
would &s;omewhat better intitle me to the honour of this
alliance. Oh, the pomp of Bidulph blood! In &s;hort,
the wedding-day was fixed for the twenty-&s;econd of
this month, and I was to depart for Germany on the
thirtieth, for &s;o it had been originally determined by
lord V&mdash;; and Sir George made this a preliminary to
his hard wrung conce&s;&s;ion. He agreed, however, to
be pre&s;ent at the ceremony, on condition that lady Sa|rah
could be per&s;uaded to come down. Lord V&mdash;and
he were to go to town in order to prevail on her if <HI>po&s;|&s;ible</HI>
to conde&s;cend &s;o far; but at all events Mi&s;s Arnold
was to be &s;ent for on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus were matters determined, when this heavy
unexpected blow fell upon us, and &s;eemed to over|whelm
the whole family, even the very &s;ervants, with
affliction. One would have thought that Love him|&s;elf
had been &s;cared from this man&s;ion of &s;orrow.
Cecilia could not li&s;ten to his &s;oothing voice, while her
mind continued under &s;uch terrible apprehen&s;ions for
her &s;i&s;ter's fate; and &s;hall I own it to you, Sir Edward,
I felt &s;uch pangs of remor&s;e, that had it not been too
late, I would have given up all and dared to have been
hone&s;t.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in both your letters that
plucked my very heart-&s;trings. Oh, Audley, do I
de&s;erve to be beloved as Mi&s;s Arnold loves me! <HI>She
would not &s;ay a word to hinder my marriage, &s;he would
die rather than &s;ee me unhappy!</HI> How I could cur&s;e
thee, thou barbarian, who could&s;t be proof again&s;t the
<PB N="84" REF="259">
tears, the &s;woonings, the tender complaints of this
amiable unfortunate girl! But why &s;hould I blame
thee? am not I my&s;elf the cau&s;e, the wicked cau&s;e of
all her di&s;tre&s;s? Yet take heed, take heed how you
treat her; if &s;he yields her&s;elf to your wi&s;hes, I will
endeavour to be as happy as my guilt will let me; but
if you have recour&s;e to violence, remember how I
clo&s;ed my la&s;t letter&mdash;that's all.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t now returned from Woodberry, where I
read a letter that Mrs. Arnold received from Sir George
this evening, wherein he tells her the following parti|culars:
[Mr. Falkland here gives his friend the &s;ub|&s;tance
of Sir George Bidulph's la&s;t letter.] This eclair|ci&s;&s;ement
has given quite a new face to our affairs.
Mrs. Arnold, though by no means charmed with her
&s;on-in-law, yet being relieved from a &s;tate of the ut|mo&s;t
uncertainty, and the mo&s;t alarming fears, is be|come
much more tranquil. When one apprehends the
very wor&s;t that <HI>can</HI> happen, one is even happy to find
it not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o bad, though &s;till bad enough in con&s;cience;
wherefore Mrs. Arnold, after having expre&s;&s;ed her ad|miration
at Dolly's <HI>amazing</HI> conduct, comforted her&s;elf
with the hope, that po&s;&s;ibly Sir Edward Audley might
turn out a &s;o$erer man than he now promi&s;ed to be,
as he was the &s;on of &s;o <HI>very</HI> good a woman.</P>
<P>She then tenderly reproached Cecilia, telling her &s;he
had made a precedent which &s;he (Mrs. Arnold) could
not tell how to defend her&s;elf from following; viz.
that of granting forgivene&s;s to one &s;i&s;ter as well as the
other. There's comfort for you, Audley! As for
Cecilia, after a thou&s;and pretty exclamations of won|der,
&s;he concluded with &s;aying, her &s;i&s;ter was very &s;ly,
for &s;he had never &s;he lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of her liking Sir
Edward. I whi&s;pered to her, Your &s;i&s;ter may retort
the &s;ame reproach on you, my &s;weet Cecilia. She
gave me a little pat on the cheek, then &s;aid, &s;he had
indeed often ob&s;erved that her &s;i&s;ter was particularly
fond of Mi&s;s Audley; that &s;he &s;ometimes fancied there
were &s;ecrets between them; that &s;he even <HI>lately</HI> had
&s;u&s;pected that Dolly's heart was touched; but by
whom &s;he could not conceive. I breathed a con&s;cious
<PB N="85" REF="260">
&s;igh! Mr. Price &s;aid he was glad the affair was cleared
up, though it was by no means in &s;o de&s;irable a man|ner
as was to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold then demanded of me, if I were not
in the &s;ecret of your love for her daughter? This
was a home pu&s;h; but I parried it as well as I could,
by telling her I had looked upon you to be &s;o general
a lover that I did not believe there had been any thing
&s;erious in your attachment to Mi&s;s Arnold, though I
had often heard you declare your&s;elf her admirer.
Cecilia laughed; Then he only <HI>pretended</HI> to admire me,
&s;aid &s;he. I'll a&s;&s;ure you, if I had thought that I was
addre&s;&s;ed only for a blind, I would have u&s;ed Sir Ed|ward
a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than I did.</P>
<P>Having canva&s;&s;ed over the fir&s;t part of Sir George's
letter, the conclu&s;ion, in which <HI>I</HI> was mo&s;t intere&s;ted,
came next on the tapis; and here you may be &s;ure I
did not fail to lay hold on that paragraph wherein he
&s;ays, <HI>&startq;You are intirely at liberty with regard to the time
of Cecilia's nuptials.&endq;</HI> I hope then, madam, &s;aid I, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
Mrs. Arnold, that this event will not make any
change with regard to my happy day? I don't &s;ee
why it &s;hould, &s;aid Mr. Price; you find, madam, Sir
George does not &s;eem to expect it &s;hould; and &s;ince
neither he nor lady Sarah intend to favour you with
their company, and this affair has deprived you of that
of Mi&s;s Arnold, the marriage may be conducted with
&s;till more privacy, for I &s;uppo&s;e, unle&s;s it be Mrs.
A&s;kham, you will not think it nece&s;&s;ary to invite any
one. I mean to have no one el&s;e pre&s;ent, replied Mrs.
Arnold, except one or two of our own people. The
day then &s;tands as it did, Audley, the day for my tran|&s;lation
to the &s;kies; for I think I &s;hall look down on
tho&s;e poor mortals called kings and emperors, when I
can call Cecilia <HI>mine.</HI> Mr. Price is to join our hands,
by favour of a &s;pecial licence, in Mrs. Arnold's own
hou&s;e. Happy Woodberry! what a different a&s;pect
do&s;t thou now wear to what thou did&s;t when I fir&s;t
quitted thy ho&s;pitable roof, uncertain, fearful, almo&s;t
hopele&s;s of my Cecilia's love! Yet I cannot be perfect|ly
at ea&s;e till I hear that you are happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="86" REF="261">
of Mi&s;s Arnold, with her <HI>own con&s;ent.</HI> Your wi&s;hes
once accompli&s;hed, I &s;hall have nothing to fear; and I
think in her pre&s;ent entangled &s;ituation it would be

<P>WHY, what a barbarous little termagant art
thou, Sophy, to rate thy poor brother &s;o un|mercifully
for a harmle&s;s piece of knight-errantry? I
looked for commendation and applau&s;e, and in&s;tead of
that you &s;top my mouth with, &startq;<HI>'Tis downright villainy
in you, brother!</HI>&endq; Why, 'tis downright cruelty in
you, &s;i&s;ter, to &s;ay &s;o. Where is the villainy of &s;eizing
the prey for which I have been &s;o long &s;preading my
toils? watching with a patience which exceeded that
of Job him&s;elf; ri&s;ing up early and going to bed late;
pa&s;&s;ing whole nights without &s;leep; di&s;patching cou|riers
from day to day; wearing my poor pens to the
&s;tumps; and killing all the po&s;t-hor&s;es between this
and Oxford: and now that I have fairly hunted the
little &s;hy animal into my net, I am to be called names,
and that by you too, recreant varlet as you are, who
originally helped to lime the twigs which we &s;pread to
catch the timorous bird! Oh, fy, fy, Sophy! I did
not expect this from you. Yet after all I forgive you,
child; your indignation on this occa&s;ion is natural, and
not only pardonable but even commendable; for, li|bertine
as I am, I &s;hould hate the woman who allowed
her&s;elf to think as freely as I do; and &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="262">
even you if you did not feel on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion
preci&s;ely as you do.</P>
<P>You thank your &s;tars, you &s;ay, that you had no

may thank your &s;tars as much as you plea&s;e; but you
are neverthele&s;s more obliged to me than you are to
them, who might, if I had plea&s;ed, have led you into
the &s;crape in &s;pite of all the &s;tars in the hemi&s;phere:
but I avoided it on purpo&s;e; for though I am an ex|travagant

her&s;elf as to have been aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in &s;o
bold an enterprize as this is. As far as a &s;imple love|plot
goes, I know you are excellent; but a &s;troke of
this nature exceeds thy feeble abilities, and is worthy
only of my&s;elf. I commend your prudence, and the
rea&s;ons that you give for not informing my mother of
the affair. Let her be innocent at lea&s;t of <HI>this</HI> offence;
for however plea&s;ed &s;he might be at the bottom with
my &s;uccefs, it will be for her credit to be ignorant of
the means I have u&s;ed to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>As for your&s;elf, my Sophy, though I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> you
are very angry with me, yet am I &s;ure al&s;o your curio|&s;ity
is &s;uch that you would give one of your white
teeth to know what is now pa&s;&s;ing here. I will gratify
you therefore at le&s;s expence; and to be as minute as
you can de&s;ire, I will take up the thread of my narra|tion
ju&s;t where I broke it off in my la&s;t. [<HI>Sir Edward
here tells his &s;i&s;ter the manner in which Mi&s;s Arnold was
carried to the hou&s;e of Mr. Bendi&s;h, which as it had
been preconcerted, was exactly as he had before de|&s;cribed

to give her hand to Bendi&s;h, who led her out
with wonderful ceremony. By the bye, I believe &s;he
was the fir&s;t mode&s;t woman (his own mother ex|cepted)
whom he had ever approached.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="263">
Ju&s;t in that juncture (for I had fallen behind a
little on purpo&s;e, did I ride up to the door in full
gallop, calling out to know what was the matter!
I immediately lit off my hor&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s
Arnold, who was in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;ee|ing
me, I told her in two words that as I could not
think of tru&s;ting her only to the care of &s;ervants, I
had, &s;pite of her prohibition, ventured to follow the
chariot on hor&s;eback; that my hor&s;e happening to
have a &s;hoe loo&s;e, I had &s;topped for a few minutes
to get it fa&s;tened, which occa&s;ioned my not being with
her when the accident of the wheel happened. I then
gravely &s;aluted Mr. Bendi&s;h as a gentleman with whom
I was not acquainted, and thanking him for his obliging
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, followed him and Mi&s;s Arnold into the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewn into his be&s;t parlour, or as old dame
Bendi&s;h u&s;ed to call it, her drawing-room; where the
blockhead over-&s;hooting the mark, had a tea-table &s;et
out with every thing ready to make tea and coffee. I
could have buffeted him for this piece of ill-timed at|tention,
which looked too premeditated; and I took it
into my head at that minute to let my fair-one enjoy
one night of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e, before I opened to
her the book of fate wherein her de&s;tiny was written.</P>
<P>As you know the character of Harry Bendi&s;h, tho'
you have not the happine&s;s to be per&s;onally acquainted
with him, I believe you will think Mi&s;s Arnold was not
under the mo&s;t &s;anctified roof in England, and that the
conver&s;ation and manners of her ho&s;t would rather
&s;hock a woman of delicacy; but you are mi&s;taken, for
my friend Harry acquitted him&s;elf to a miracle, con&s;i|dering
how little he had been accu&s;tomed to the com|pany
of, not <HI>ladies,</HI> but <HI>gentlewomen.</HI> The wor&s;t of
it was, that being thrown out of his bias, he &s;carce
knew what to &s;ay; and though he by no means wants
parts, yet not daring to enter on his u&s;ual topics, he
&s;eemed rather deficient in common &s;en&s;e; and in avoid|ing
to be thought a rake, he hardly e&s;caped being con|&s;idered
as a fool. He told Mi&s;s Arnold, that having
had the misfortune to bury his mother (the be&s;t old
<PB N="89" REF="264">
gentlewoman in the world) about three weeks ago, he
was not &s;o happy as to have any lady in the hou&s;e;
and therefore de&s;ired to know if &s;he would permit his
hou&s;ekeeper to come in and make tea. Then turning
to me, She is a devili&s;h hand&s;ome wench, I can tell
you, Au&mdash;I gave him a look that would have pe|trified
Medu&s;a her&s;elf, and arre&s;ted my own name,
which was ju&s;t popping out of his mouth. He turned
it off with an Augh&mdash;and two or three coughs.
By the greate&s;t good luck imaginable, Mi&s;s Arnold did
not di&s;tinctly hear what he &s;aid, as he was &s;eated next
to me; and &s;he at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the fire. I re|peated,
If &s;he be as <HI>handy</HI> a wench as you &s;ay, &s;ir, I
believe &s;he had be&s;t come in and do the honours of
your tea-table. He rang the bell, though not recover|ed
from his confu&s;ion, and ordered one of the &s;ervants
to &s;end in the hou&s;ekeeper; but was an&s;wered that &s;he
was gone very ill to bed. I am &s;orry for it, &s;aid he;
for &s;he was &s;uch a favourite of my mother's, that &s;ince
<HI>her</HI> death I have put the care of my hou&s;e intirely into
this good body's hands. Mi&s;s Arnold was then re|que&s;ted
to take the trouble of making tea her&s;elf; which
&s;he did.</P>
<P>We were informed, in about half an hour, that the
wheel was <HI>unmendable;</HI> it was made of un&s;ea&s;oned
wood; the coach-maker was the greate&s;t rogue in
Chri&s;tendom; and finally, there was no proceeding
without a new wheel, which could not be procured
that night. Mi&s;s Arnold looked mor$ified and dejected.
Our friend &s;aid, he was very &s;orry he had not a car|riage
to offer her; if he were ma&s;ter of a coach-and-&s;ix,
it &s;hould be at her &s;ervice; but as the matter &s;tood,
he hoped &s;he would accept of a bed at his hou&s;e. I
thought it proper here to clo&s;e in with the propo&s;al;
and thanking the gentleman for his politene&s;s, I told
Mi&s;s Arnold &s;he could not do otherwi&s;e than accept of
his obliging offer, as we were &s;ix miles from an inn.
She &s;eemed not to reli&s;h the &s;cheme; but having no
other choice to make, &s;he was obliged to acquie&s;ce. She
complained of being fatigued, and &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed,
and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould beg leave to retire as &s;oon as a cham|ber
<PB N="90" REF="265">
could be got ready for her. Upon which a cham|ber-maid
was called, and ordered to conduct her to the
apartment which before had been allotted to her. You
may be &s;ure the &s;ervants had their le&s;&s;ons; &s;o that &s;he
was not likely to di&s;cover that night into what part of
the world &s;he was got.</P>
<P>Poor Bendi&s;h, who had been under a cruel re&s;traint
in her pre&s;ence, &s;wore he never was &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed in
his life; but being now at liberty, we enjoyed our&s;elves
over our bottle till midnight.</P>
<P>When I ro&s;e this morning, being informed the lady
was already up, I went down to the parlour, where I
found her. After the fir&s;t civilities were over, &s;he beg|ged
of me to enquire if the carriage was ready. She
&s;aid &s;he was impatient to be gone; for though &s;he was
much obliged to the gentleman of the hou&s;e for his
ho&s;pitality, yet as &s;he thought her&s;elf in a very impro|per
&s;ituation, &s;he could not leave it too &s;oon.</P>
<P>It was now time, Sophy, to confe&s;s my crime; and
as I had nothing for it but to brazen it out, I approach|ed
her with an a&s;&s;ured air, and reque&s;ted of her to be
&s;eated till &s;he heard what I had to &s;ay. She obeyed me
but by halves; for without &s;itting down, Well, &s;ir,
&s;aid &s;he, <HI>what</HI> have you to &s;ay? That I cannot think
of parting with you, madam, now, that chance has
&s;o luckily thrown you into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;Not think of
parting with me! what do you mean, Sir Edward?
'Tis time, madam, to undeceive you; you are not on
your road to Woodberry, but in another part of the
country, and in the hou&s;e of a particular friend of mine,
whither I have led you, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure to my|&s;elf
the happine&s;s of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with you;
a liberty in which I knew I &s;hould not be indulged if
I re&s;tored you to your family. You cannot be &s;erious,
Sir Edward, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible. Am I not at Beaconsfield?
By no means, madam, you are on Bag&s;hot-heath, and
in the hou&s;e of my mo&s;t intimate acquaintance. Mercy
on me, what <HI>will</HI> become of me! Be not alarmed,
madam, I entertain not a thought with regard to you
that is not dictated by the mo&s;t re&s;pectful love. Re|&s;pect!
Oh, Sir Edward, do you call it <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to betray
<PB N="91" REF="266">
me in this cruel manner? You mu&s;t blame your&s;elf,
madam; your own coldne&s;s, your own unkind diffi|dence
of me, which has urged me to this extremity. I
own I have deceived you, and have nothing to plead
in my excu&s;e but a de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I offered
to conduct you to my mother's, under who&s;e care and
protection you might have remained till it was more
convenient for you to return home. You refu&s;ed the
a&s;ylum of her hou&s;e. Cruel creature! I &s;aw too plain|ly
the cau&s;e of your refu&s;al. 'Twas I, I was the ob|ject
from whom you would have flown. I afterwards
begged your permi&s;&s;ion to attend you home; but even
this favour I was denied, and you cho&s;e to abandon
your&s;elf alone to the hazards of a journey, rather than
allow me even this &s;mall mark of di&s;tinction. Then it
was (and nor before) that love in&s;pired me with this
&s;tratagem to detain a perver&s;e beauty, who I found
preferred &s;till in her heart the ungrateful, the perfi|dious
man who &s;o flag$antly had deceived her, to the
tender, the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> lover, who adored her with a &s;in|cerity
not ea&s;y to be met with in our &s;ex. I gave this
latter part of my &s;peech that &s;ort of tone which indig|nant
truth a&s;&s;umes, when it would defend its own
rights. I thought, replied my captive, that the incli|nation
you once profe&s;&s;ed for me, had been quite &s;ub|dued.
I fairly owned the &s;tate of my heart to your &s;i&s;ter,
and you your&s;elf were not ignorant of my unfor|tunate
attachment to another per&s;on. True, madam,
and it was on that account that I gave up my hopes;
yet pardon me if I add, and I think I may without va|nity
&s;ay, that <HI>my</HI> preten&s;ions would, in the eyes of the
world, have appeared better founded than tho&s;e of
Falkland. Yet I &s;acrificed all to friend&s;hip: let Falk|land
him&s;elf bear me witne&s;s that the name of <HI>rival</HI>
was lo&s;t in that of friend. Nay, I went farther, and
by trying to acquire a reli&s;h for other charms, endea|voured
to root yours out of my heart; but my &s;trug|gles
were in vain, and at the time when I offered in|cen&s;e
to your &s;i&s;ter's beauty, I found my&s;elf in the con|dition
of tho&s;e feigned apo&s;tates, who whil&s;t they bow
down to a fal&s;e wor&s;hip, in their hearts &s;till adore the
<PB N="92" REF="267">
true divinity. Yes, madam, I have been faithful to
you, from the moment I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf your lover;
and though I cea&s;ed to importune, I cea&s;ed not to ad|mire
you. Yet had Falkland been ju&s;t, you &s;hould ne|ver
have known me for any other than your friend; his
infidelity, I own, renewed my wi&s;hes, and the accident
which has now put you into my hands, has even en|couraged
my hopes.&mdash;What hopes do you then
entertain? &s;aid &s;he, with a countenance on which was
painted more of terror than of any other pa&s;&s;ion. That
you will make me happy, &s;aid I, by giving me your
hand.&mdash;What here, &s;ir? Now! now in this &s;trange
hou&s;e? I do not &s;ay that, madam; if you will pro|mi&s;e
faithfully to be mine, I will conduct you home.
I am &s;ure I can rely upon your word. I have &s;ome
little claim to your con&s;ideration. Will you, madam,
make me the promi&s;e I demand? (I knew &s;he would
not.) I cannot, Sir Edward, indeed I cannot. I never
will marry, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I never will marry. But,
dear madam, why &s;o &s;trange, &s;o cruel a re&s;olution? A
lady in the pride of youth and loveline&s;s to devote her|&s;elf
to a &s;ingle life! 'Tis doing inju&s;tice to mankind;
if you find <HI>one</HI> lover fal&s;e, are the re&s;t of his &s;ex to
&s;uffer for that? Oh, Sir, all men are alike, I believe;
I will tru&s;t none of them. There are, indeed, but too
many of us faulty, an&s;wered I; yet a&s;&s;uredly, dear
Mi&s;s Arnold, your cen&s;ure is too general. It may be
&s;o, &s;ir; but the only two in whom I have confided,
have betrayed me. The faults which <HI>love</HI> commits
again&s;t the object beloved, merit not &s;o har&s;h an epi|thet;
'tis the c$imes only of cool infidelity which de|&s;erve
the name of trea&s;on. She made me no an&s;wer,
but &s;pringing lightly to the window which looked into
the fore-court, I thought, &s;aid &s;he, I heard a carriage,
and was in hopes it was the chariot; for, after all, I
believe you only want to terrify me. If that was your
de&s;ign, you have but too well &s;ucceeded; you <HI>have</HI>
terrified me, &s;ir, exceedingly terrified me. To &s;ay the
truth, the poor girl &s;hook like a leaf, and was obliged
to &s;it down in the window to &s;upport her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="268">
The noi&s;e &s;he heard in the court, and which &s;he took
for the chariot, was nothing more than a little market-cart,
which was u&s;ed to carry home provi&s;ions, and
which now arrived filled with neee&s;&s;aries for the hou&s;e;
and on its entering the court, &s;he ob&s;erved one of the
&s;ervants look the gate and take the key out. This ac|tion
&s;eemed to deprive her almo&s;t of her rea&s;on. She
ca&s;t a frantic look at me, What, fir, am I a pri&s;oner
then? Am I to be detained here by force? No, no,
I mu&s;t not &s;uffer this, &s;tarting up from her &s;eat. I
drew near her, and ventured to lay hold of her hand.
Let me go, &s;ir; let me be gone from hence this minute.
Whither would you go, madam? Home, home;
whither &s;hould I go but home to my mama! Unkind,
&s;aid I, 'tis to Falkland you would fly, not to your ma|ma;
but remember he is now perhaps the hu&s;band of
Cecilia.&mdash;What have I done to you, cried &s;he, that
you treat me thus inhumanly? A flood of tears &s;uc|ceeded
her words. 'Tis a trite ob&s;ervation, that no|thing
affects a man &s;o much as weeping beauty. I now
felt the truth of it, and was really &s;o touched at her
tears, that I fell on my knees before her, and &s;aid as
many tenderly extravagant things as if I had been ac|tually
over head and ears in love; but the obdurate
fair was not to be moved. Let me be gone, &s;ir, let
me go home to my mama, was the burden of her
&s;ong. But think of the con&s;equences, madam, think
of your reputation; 'tis already known that you have
pa&s;&s;ed two nights in my lodgings.&mdash;In <HI>your</HI> lodgings,
&s;ir! Yes, madam, tho&s;e apartments in which you
&s;pent two nights at Brumpton are mine; it will be
known that you left them in my chariot, and that I ac|companied
you out of town, and that at a time too
when you expected to receive a vi&s;it from your uncle.
It will be known that, in&s;tead of returning home, you
retired to the hou&s;e of my particular friend, a &s;ingle
man, no lady to bear you company, and that I attend|ed
you hither: what mu&s;t the world think of all this,
madam? Will it not naturally conclude me to be al|ready
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that happy title to which I a&s;pire?
<PB N="94" REF="269">
And will it not be more for your honour, permit me to
&s;ay, for the honour of your family too, to give proof
to this natural conclu&s;ion, than by undeceiving people,
to leave them at liberty to judge (pardon me, if I pre|&s;ume
to &s;ay) perhaps very unfavourably of your con|duct?
She wrung her hands with all the marks of the
bittere&s;t angui&s;h. I endeavoured to &s;ooth her. Some|times
I implored her pity, and in the humble&s;t language
be&s;eeched her to grant me the return I de&s;ired; then
again I repre&s;ented to her the precipice on which &s;he
&s;tood. This la&s;t idea &s;eemed to &s;trike her with horror,
and I really thought, more than once, that &s;he gave
&s;ome indications of a &s;ituation of mind too alarming to
name; yet I hope 'tis nothing but her extreme &s;en&s;ibili|ty,
and that after tho&s;e fir&s;t violent &s;truggles are
over, rea&s;on and di&s;cretion will rea&s;&s;ume their em|pire;
and that finding &s;he has no other party to
choo&s;e, &s;he will conde&s;cend to be lady Audley, with
no other &s;tain than what matrimony will wipe out,
that of running away with her lover, rather than
continue Mi&s;s Arnold with an indelible blot on her
reputation.</P>
<P>Bendi&s;h entered the parlour during our conver&s;a|tion,
or rather during my harangue, for I could ob|tain
no an&s;wer from her. She ju&s;t ca&s;t her eyes at
him as he entered, and withdrew them again with|out
&s;peaking, or even returning his &s;alute. He &s;eem|ed
aba&s;hed, and as if at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s her;
when, after hoping &s;he re&s;ted well, and &s;aying it was
very cold weather, he called for coffee, for we had not
yet breakfa&s;ted. Mi&s;s Arnold remained in &s;ullen &s;ilence,
nor could be prevailed on to touch any thing. How
wilful are you women, Sophy! I'll be hanged, if this
pretty &s;tubborn creature would &s;cruple, with all her
piety, to &s;tarve her&s;elf, rather than yield to the vir|tuous
pa&s;&s;ion of an hone&s;t fellow like me. You would
have &s;miled had you &s;een Bendi&s;h's aukward attempts
to put the lady in good humour; for he, who only
under&s;tood the affected coyne&s;s of a &s;emp&s;tre&s;s, was in
<PB N="95" REF="270">
hopes that at lea&s;t half of Mi&s;s Arnold's re&s;erve was
grimace. He told her, if &s;he loved fox-hunting, he
could mount her as well as any woman in England. She
made him no reply, I am &s;orry to &s;ee you &s;o grave,
madam; I hope no part of my behaviour has offended
you. Sir, I am a &s;tranger to <HI>you,</HI> I have no right to
your friend&s;hip; yet it is cruel in you to enter into a
con&s;piracy again&s;t a poor young per&s;on that never in|jured
you. I am a helple&s;s creature my&s;elf; but I
have &s;ome friends that&mdash;She &s;topped her&s;elf &s;hort at
this word, and hung down her head, as if &s;tung with
the bitter recollection of having lo&s;t her protectors;
then added, I <HI>thought</HI> I had &s;ome friends; but now I
remember I have lo&s;t them. You have a friend in Sir
Edward, replied Bendi&s;h, that will make you amends
for them all; take my word for it, madam, he will
make you the be&s;t hu&s;band in the world&mdash;But,
&s;ir, I do not mean to be his wife. Was not this pro|voking,
Sophy? And &s;he &s;poke it with as cool a com|po&s;ure
as if &s;he had been her own mi&s;tre&s;s. You will
think better of it, I hope, madam; I flattered my&s;elf
that I &s;hould have found le&s;s difficulty in per&s;uading
you to a &s;tep, which I think the only one that can &s;ave
your reputation. Ay, madam, think of that, &s;aid my
friend Bendi&s;h; a lady's reputation is all in all: and, by
my&mdash;I gave him a horrible frown, to &s;top the oath
that I &s;aw ready to &s;lip out; for I had already for|bid
him to &s;wear before her. He &s;wallowed it, and
hemming two or three times; And, upon my word,
&s;aid he, con&s;idering the bad hands&mdash;I was afraid
he was going again to blunder, in expo&s;ing, perhaps,
his own character as well as mine;&mdash;Ay, &s;aid I, inter|rupting
him, con&s;idering the bad hands into which a
young lady may fall in this wicked world, once &s;he
has forfeited the e&s;teem of her family, &s;he cannot too
&s;oon put her&s;elf under the protection of a hu&s;band. I
hope Mi&s;s Arnold will con&s;ider this. I &s;hall give you,
madam, all the rea&s;onable time you can de&s;ire for re|flection;
<PB N="96" REF="271">
but be a&s;&s;ured I will not part with the ble&s;|&s;ing
which my lucky &s;tars have &s;o unexpectedly thrown
into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be mine, madam; I
would rather owe my felicity to your own voluntary
conde&s;cen&s;ion; yet once we are united, I will tru&s;t to
your gratitude for a return to my tenderne&s;s. Mi&s;s
Arnold made no reply. She &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in her
own thoughts. Ay, ay, &s;aid Bendi&s;h, love will come
after; you cannot chu&s;e a worthier fellow than Sir Ed|ward
Audley. What &s;ay you, madam? when &s;hall
we &s;end for the par&s;on? I long, of all things, to dance
at a wedding. I do not find my&s;elf in a condition to
argue with you, replied the lady. May I be allowed
to retire into another room? You command here, ma|dam,
&s;aid I; you are at liberty to do as you plea&s;e
<HI>within</HI> the&s;e walls; and from the moment that you
confer on me the happie&s;t of titles, you may di&s;po&s;e
of <HI>me</HI> too as you think proper.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e off her &s;eat, and, without vouch&s;afing me
an an&s;wer, left the parlour, and ran up &s;tairs; and we
heard her bolt the door of the chamber wherein &s;he
had &s;lept the night before.</P>
<P>Bendi&s;h &s;aid he would go and order his hou&s;ekeeper
to attend her; adding, it would be for my intere&s;t that
&s;he &s;hould conver&s;e with her; for &s;he was a very &s;en|&s;ible
woman, and would try to per&s;uade her to rea|&s;on.
In hopes, therefore, of &s;ome good effects from
this conver&s;ation, I intruded not on her for the re&s;t of
the morning.</P>
<P>We heard no more of her till dinner-time; when &s;he
was humbly intreated to honour us with her company.
She &s;ent her compliments to Mr. Bendi&s;h, and &s;aid, &s;he
would take it as a favour if he would excu&s;e her com|ing
down, as &s;he did not find her&s;elf very well. De|termined
as I was to give her as little room as po&s;&s;ible
to complain of my behaviour, I &s;ent her word &s;he
might con&s;ider her&s;elf as at home; for that &s;he &s;hould
be obeyed in every thing: and we &s;ent her up three
or four plates of the nice&s;t things that were at table.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="272">
The chamber-maid who attended her &s;aid, that &s;he
&s;carce touched any thing, and &s;eemed very melancho|ly.
Sweet ob&s;tinacy! but I hope to find her in better
humour to-morrow. I a&s;ked my friend Harry, why
his hou&s;ekeeper did not &s;tay to keep her company, and
endeavour to divert her? He &s;aid &s;he had been with
her for &s;ome time in the morning; but he believed
the lady did not much like her company: for it &s;eems
the blockhead had been &s;o imprudent as to de&s;ire this
woman to hint &s;omething to Mi&s;s Arnold (in ca&s;e of
her per&s;i&s;ting in her refu&s;al to marry me) which, I
a&s;&s;ure you, was very far from my thought, and which
none but &s;uch a gracele&s;s dog as Bendi&s;h would have
in&s;inuated. I &s;wore at him heartily for it; but he
called me a dolt, and &s;aid I &s;hould &s;ee better effects
from this little threat than all my cringing would pro|duce
in a twelve month. And &s;aith, I begin to be|lieve
him; for in the afternoon, to my great a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
the godde&s;s, of her own accord, de&s;cended to
the parlour, neatly dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome of the &s;poils of
your wardrobe, which had been left for her in her
chamber. Her vouch&s;a&s;ing to put them on is a good
&s;ign, you will &s;ay. She made a cold apology for not
coming to dinner; but &s;aid &s;he now found her&s;elf &s;ome|thing
better. I &s;ee there is nothing like making you
women afraid of us; for a man who is feared, is
&s;urer of <HI>civil</HI> treatment, at lea&s;t, than he who is be|loved:
it is the nature of the little ungrateful &s;ex!</P>
<P>Bendi&s;h gave me an intelligent nod and a wink when
&s;he entered the room, as much as to &s;ay, Who's in the
right, you or I? She &s;at down, at our humble reque&s;t;
but it was vi&s;ible that &s;he put a violent con&s;traint on
her&s;elf in granting us this favour. I thought it not
advi&s;able to urge my &s;uit at that juncture. I have
gained &s;ome ground, and hope a few days prudent
reflection on the lady's part, and a little wi&s;e manage|ment
on ours, will induce her, <HI>without</HI> compul&s;ion,
to con&s;ent to my wi&s;hes. The conver&s;ation, for half
an hour, was extremely &s;tupid. Bendi&s;h talked of
the improvements he intended to make in his great
<PB N="98" REF="273">
old fa&s;hioned hou&s;e, not one of which had either any
meaning in them&s;elves, or any reality in the intention.
I affected to &s;igh often, gazed at the fair, and now
and then threw in a word, &s;uch as, Ay, that will in|deed
be pretty&mdash;Oh, it will be much better &s;o.&mdash;Mi&s;s
Arnold &s;eemed to give little heed to either of us, but
appeared &s;till buried in her own gloomy reflections.
How childi&s;h was all this! Would it not be better
&s;ince &s;he knows &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> yield, to do it frankly, le&s;t I
&s;hould hereafter retaliate her coldne&s;s, and &s;he &s;hould,
in her turn, find her&s;elf obliged to become a wooer?</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, I ventured gently to
lay hold of her hand, and, with a &s;oft voice, whi&s;|pered
to her, I hope the re&s;ult of my dear Mi&s;s Ar|nold's
deep meditations will not turn out unfavourably
for me. She &s;tarted, as if awakened from a reverie,
whil&s;t her lilly hand, like the &s;en&s;itive plant, &s;hrunk
from my touch; and with a look of terror, mingled
with an apparent fear of di&s;obliging me, &s;he as it were
&s;tole the hand from me that I had &s;till followed and
held. Then ri&s;ing from her chair, Sir Edward, &s;aid
&s;he, excu&s;e me for the pre&s;ent, my thoughts are too
much di&s;ordered to talk with you; to-morrow, perhaps,
I may be better able to &s;peak. I bowed down to her
&s;hoe-tie, ki&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time, whether &s;he would
or no, the pretty little coy hand that &s;he had with|drawn
from me. She made Bendi&s;h a low curt&s;ie;
but this curt&s;ie was not of the right breed: It proceed|ed
from the &s;ame motive that makes the Indians wor|&s;hip
the d&mdash;l. She immediately quitted the room,
and tripped up &s;tairs again to her own apartment.
Sweet &s;oul! I really am fond of her; and were &s;he
but grateful&mdash;But no matter for that, I'll make her
a good hu&s;band; for I intend to reform after I am
married. Bendi&s;h did not fail to exult on his &s;uperior
addre&s;s in having frightened her into good behaviour,
as he called it.</P>
<P>To-morrow then, Sophy, I may probably know
my fate; that is to &s;ay, as far as it depends on a wo|man's
<HI>will.</HI> Good creature! I hope, for her own
<PB N="99" REF="274">
&s;ake, &s;he will not oblige me to make u&s;e of my autho|rity.
I &s;hall have a par&s;on ready, an ancient friend
and ally, who has lately taken orders. Falkland is to
be joined to his Cecilia on Friday the 22d, and, on
that &s;ame au&s;picious day, will I, like a &s;ober and
di&s;creet gentleman, enter into the honourable &s;tate of
wedlock. I love the&s;e little &s;nug marriages, where
Hymen comes as it were incog. without his tawdry
&s;affron coloured robe to fleer in people's eyes; and for
his torch, he may clap it into a dark lantern.</P>
<P>I have written you &s;uch a volume, that I que&s;tion
whether I &s;hall be time enough for the po&s;t; &s;o you
mu&s;t content your&s;elf without knowing any farther
particulars of to-night: and for the day of days, I
&s;hall be too much elated to de&s;cend to minutene&s;&s;es;
therefore you are to look for nothing more from me
than an I O, which I will write you in huge capitals,
without adding a &s;ingle word more.</P>

<P>NOW bla&s;ts upon her! She is gone, fled, vani&s;h|ed,
out of &s;ight, hearing, and reach! Talk
of man's art! man's di&s;&s;imulation! Why, we are
lambs, doves, or if there be &s;uch things, &s;ucking che|rubims,
to vile deceitful woman! The &s;mooth little

&s;ooth my $opes, a$ a time when &s;he was meditating
&s;uch a wicked e&s;cape! Yet <HI>&s;he</HI> was not the contriver

<PB N="100" REF="275">
I was not &s;ure. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he told a pitiful tale, and
this officious go&s;&s;ip, thinking to be better rewarded by
the lady's friends for a breach of tru&s;t, than &s;he would
be by her ma&s;ter for her fidelity, took the wi&s;e re&s;oluti|on
to a&s;&s;i&s;t and accompany her in her flight.</P>
<P>All we can learn is, that Mrs. Spillman (that is
the name of this cur&s;ed woman) &s;ent a note late ye&s;|terday
evening by a pea&s;ant in the neighbourhood to
the ma&s;ter of the po&s;t-hou&s;e at Bag&s;hot, de&s;iring him
to &s;end two of his be&s;t hor&s;es with a guide to Mr.
Bendi&s;h's at four o'clock the next morning, two ladies
being to depart at that hour on an affair of the utmo&s;t
con&s;equence. One of the hor&s;es was to be furni&s;hed
with a &s;ide-&s;addle, the other, on which the guide rid,
was to carry double. The man did as he was direct|ed;
and this witch having all the keys of the hou&s;e
in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had nothing to do but to unlock the
doors, and fly with my prey. The outer gate was
found open this morning, and the hou&s;e-keeper not
appearing at her u&s;ual hour, the &s;ervants thought &s;he
had gone out early on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s. Mi&s;s Arnold
(the &s;orcere&s;s, I cannot name her with patience) was
not mi&s;&s;ed till nine o'clock, when a maid going to her
chamber, to attend her as &s;he had done the morning
before, knocking at the door, but receiving no an|&s;wer
after repeated trials, &s;he came to inform her
ma&s;ter, for the door was locked. I ran, from a &s;ort
of foreboding of misfortune, like a fury to her cham|ber,
and bur&s;t the door open. What a legion of ana|themas
did I then pour out on Bendi&s;h and every &s;oul
in his hou&s;e! But to what purpo&s;e was my idle rage?
No one could give any account of the lady nor of
Mrs. Spillman. All we could gather is the account
I have already given you, which I had from the inn-keeper
him&s;elf. Neither his &s;ervant nor hor&s;es are yet
returned; I &s;uppo&s;e they are detained to prevent our
knowing what road they took. A needle&s;s precaution,
for at the time we di&s;covered their flight, was there a

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 19th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JOIN with me in prayer, Cecilia, add your pe|titions
to mine, that that patience and re&s;ignation
to the Supreme Will, which has &s;u&s;tained my youth
though a &s;eries of afflictions, for&s;ake me not now in
this hour of new and bitter calamity. My child!&mdash;
my poor Dolly&mdash;</P>
<P>There&mdash;I have wept, and now I'll try to tell you;
yet I fear it will &s;hock you too much.&mdash;The poor child
is&mdash;indeed I believe, my dear, her rea&s;on is im|paired.
She is returned home to me; what a piteous
&s;pectacle? yet I ble&s;s Heaven that &s;he has e&s;caped the
dreadful &s;nare that was laid for her.</P>
<P>This day about noon my daughter Cecilia and I
were &s;itting together in the parlour, when we &s;aw a
plain kind of a chai&s;e, &s;uch as &s;ome of our farmers
have, drive up to the door. Two women &s;tep'd out
of it. We heard Mi&s;s Arnold's name pronounced by
one of the &s;ervants, as if in an exclamation of &s;ur|prize
and joy; the parlour door was &s;uddenly thrown
open, and my poor dear girl ran in, followed by a pretty
looking young woman, plainly, but neatly dre&s;&s;ed.
My child flew to me, and cla&s;ping her arms round
my neck, let her&s;elf &s;ink on my bo&s;om; where &s;he
<PB N="102" REF="277">
remained without &s;peaking a word. The abruptne&s;s
of her entry, accompanied as &s;he was by a &s;tranger,
joined to the idea of her conduct which then appear|ed
to me &s;o faulty, equally &s;hocked and offended me.
I had not, however, the immediate power to recollect
my&s;elf; but quickly recovering from my &s;urprize, I
di&s;engaged my&s;elf from her embrace, and putting her
from me with my hand, I was going to &s;peak, har&s;hly,
I believe it would have been; but &s;he prevented me.
&mdash;Will you not receive me, mama? &s;aid &s;he. Whi|ther
then mu&s;t I fly for refuge! Nor you, Cecilia?
(looking eagerly at her &s;i&s;ter, who, checked by my
example, had not ventured to approach her) do <HI>you</HI>
ca&s;t me off too? Perhaps you do not know me; I
think indeed I am &s;adly altered with the terrors I have
undergone for I don't know how long; yet indeed I
am your &s;i&s;ter. This gentlewoman here can tell you
what I hive &s;uffered; if it had not been for her,
I don't know what they would have done with me&mdash;
killed me, I &s;uppo&s;e; for I never, never would have
married Sir Edward Audley.</P>
<P>You may judge, my dear, how I was alarmed at
hearing her talk thus. The young woman, who had
hitherto &s;tood &s;ilent, but who appeared extremely af|fected,
now addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me, and with great
mode&s;ty apologized for having &s;o rudely broke in upon
me. My de&s;ign, madam, &s;aid &s;he, was to have re|que&s;ted
the honour of &s;peaking a few words to you
in private, in order to prepare you for &s;eeing Mi&s;s
Arnold; but the &s;ervant who let us in was &s;o &s;ur|prized
and overjoyed at the &s;ight of his young lady,
that without giving me time to &s;peak, his impatience
to introduce her made him abruptly throw open the
parlour door, and Mi&s;s Arnold entered before it was
in my power to prevent her. Indeed, madam, &s;he
has been cruelly u&s;ed; yet I ble&s;s God for having
been the means of delivering her from the vile&s;t of
men.</P>
<P>My poor girl &s;tood motionle&s;s, with her eyes fixed
on me whil&s;t this young per&s;on &s;poke; Cecilia melted
<PB N="103" REF="278">
into tears; for my part, I was &s;o overwhelmed with
dreadful apprehen&s;ions from what I had ju&s;t heard,
that without daring to demand an explanation, I could
only expre&s;s the terror of my mind by broken excla|mations.
The &s;tranger ea&s;ily comprehended which
way my fears pointed.&mdash;Do not terrify your&s;elf, good
madam, &s;aid &s;he; Mi&s;s Arnold has received no other
injury than that of being detained again&s;t her will,
and brutally urged to marry a wicked man whom
&s;he hates. Had &s;he not e&s;caped his hands, I know not
indeed whether her ruin would not have been by this
time effected.</P>
<P>This declaration having calmed my thoughts a little,
I turned towards my unhappy child; &s;he was now
locked in her &s;i&s;ter's arms. Cecilia's face was wet with
tears; &s;he tenderly embraced Dolly, who, without
&s;eeming much affected with her care&s;&s;es, a&s;ked her
why &s;he wept? Are you not happy, my &s;i&s;ter? &s;aid
&s;he; has your lover for&s;aken you? No, replied Ce|cilia,
&s;obbing, (who then preceived that the poor crea|ture's
thoughts were wandering) no, my dear, &s;o far
the contrary, that the day is appointed for uniting us
for ever. We all thought that you had been married
to Sir Edward Audley, which made us give up the
hope of having you pre&s;ent at our nuptials.&mdash;Fy, fy!
how could you think &s;o? &s;aid Dolly; I never loved
Sir Edward, <HI>He</HI> never had my promi&s;e. How came
you then to put your&s;elf into his hands, my love? &s;aid
I. Oh, mama, do not a&s;k me, &s;he replied, my re|collection
does not carry me &s;o far back; but I believe
that lady (pointing to the &s;tranger) can tell you. The
young woman &s;hook her head; I'll tell you all I know
of the matter, madam, &s;aid &s;he, in a low voice, if you
will allow me the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;peaking to you alone.
Lead your &s;i&s;ter up to your own chamber, my dear,
&s;aid I to Cecilia, and try to make her take a little re&s;t;
&s;he &s;eems fatigued, and to &s;tand in great need of repo&s;e.
She does indeed, madam, replied the young per&s;on&punc;
for &s;he has &s;carce clo&s;ed her eyes the&s;e three nights.
My poor child, what have been thy &s;ufferings! Her
<PB N="104" REF="279">
&s;i&s;ter took her by the hand, Come, my love, will you
come up &s;tairs with me? Whither would you carry
me? cried &s;he, drawing back her hand; ah, Cecilia,
will <HI>you</HI> betray me too? You would &s;end me back to
that vile Sir Audley; but you need not, I will not
di&s;turb your happine&s;s, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I will not &s;ay
a word to grieve you. I could not bear to li&s;ten to
her: Take her from me, &s;aid I to Cecilia, it kills me
to hear her talk thus. Go, my deare&s;t, endeavour to
get a little &s;leep; I will come to you in half an hour.
You will not then turn me out of your hou&s;e, mama?
By no means, my beloved, I am not angry with you,
I want you but to retire to your &s;i&s;ter's or your own
apartment to lie down for a little while. Is not there
<HI>one</HI> Orlando, &s;omewhere hereabouts? looking at her
&s;i&s;ter with a melancholy &s;mile. Yes, yes, and you
&s;hall &s;ee him pre&s;ently.&mdash;Nay, I do not want to &s;ee
him, I am only glad to hear that he is alive.&mdash;And
poor Mr. Price, is the good man in being yet, for he
was very old the la&s;t time I &s;aw him? Cecilia could not
an&s;wer her; &s;he again took her by the hand, and
Dolly &s;uffered her to lead her out of the room.</P>
<P>I gave a loo&s;e to my tears the moment &s;he was gone;
the young woman wept with me: Oh, madam, what
a mournful &s;ight to &s;ee &s;o fine a young creature di&s;|ordered
in her mind! I have been apprehen&s;ive of
&s;ome &s;uch thing the&s;e two days; but was not certain
of it till now: what pity! but I hope in God &s;he will
come to her&s;elf, now &s;he has got back to her friends.</P>
<P>After having dried my eyes, I de&s;ired her to relate
to me what &s;he knew with regard to my daughter.</P>
<P>She then told me that &s;he her&s;elf was hou&s;e-keeper
to a Mr. Bendi&s;h, who has a hou&s;e on Bag&s;hot-heath;
that &s;he had been originally hired as a &s;ervant to his
mother, a very worthy woman, who having died with|in
this month, the &s;on, on coming to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
her jointure, of which this &s;eat is a part, had retained
her in the &s;ame capacity in which he had found her;
but perceiving he was a young man of very loo&s;e
morals, &s;he had determined to quit him.&mdash;I was oblig|ed
<PB N="105" REF="280">
to li&s;ten to the&s;e and a few other unnece&s;&s;ary pre|liminaries
relative to her&s;elf, before &s;he came to that
part of her &s;tory which concerned my daughter. I
am entirely ignorant, madam, &s;aid &s;he, by what means
Mi&s;s Arnold fir&s;t came into Sir Edward Audley's
hands. She only told me it was by a &s;trange unfortu|nate
accident; all I know is, that four days ago &s;he
arrived at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e late in the evening. She
was alone, in Sir Edward's chariot, which broke (and
as I have &s;ince learned, by a contrivance of his) ju&s;t
before our door. Sir Edward him&s;elf had followed
her on hor&s;eback. The young lady was quite igno|rant
of the de&s;ign; but Mr. Bendi&s;h, I am &s;ure, ex|pected
them, for he had ordered two bed chambers to
be got ready, and a very hand&s;ome &s;upper prepared. I
knew not who the expected gue&s;ts were till after their
arrival, when I heard among&s;t the &s;ervants that the
gentleman was Sir Edward Audley; but they knew not
the lady. I was no &s;ooner told this, continued &s;he,
than I was perfectly convinced there was &s;ome ba&s;e de|&s;ign
going on, for I was not a &s;tranger to Sir Edward's
principles. The poor creature &s;topped and wiped her
eyes, into which the tears &s;prung fa&s;t. Are you then
acquainted with Sir Edward, madam? &s;aid I. Yes, to
my great &s;orrow, madam, &s;he replied; I will tell you
my unhappy &s;tory another time. I would not then a&s;k
her any que&s;tions, and &s;he proceeded. It was my
ma&s;ter's cu&s;tom to call me into the parlour &s;ometimes
to make tea for his company, when any of them
cho&s;e to drink it; but as I was re&s;olved Sir Edward
&s;hould not &s;ee me, I pretended to be &s;ick that night,
and &s;hut my&s;elf up in my own room to avoid appearing:</P>
<P>The next morning my ma&s;ter called me a&s;ide, and
ordered me to go into the young lady's room; She is
a perver&s;e &s;illy girl, &s;aid he, that Sir Edward Audley
has run away with, and is determined to make her his
wife. If &s;he con&s;ents quietly, well and good; if not,
(&s;wearing a vile oath) &s;he may chance to repent her
ob&s;tinacy. I know, added he, you women under&s;tand
be&s;t how to deal with each other; and as I think you
<PB N="106" REF="281">
are a di&s;creet &s;en&s;ible girl, I would have you repre&s;ent
to her the ri&s;que &s;he runs of <HI>more</HI> than reputation, if
&s;he refu&s;es to accept of him for a hu&s;band. He ad|ded
to this many other things, and &s;ome promi&s;es in Sir
Edward's name, to engage me in their unworthy de|&s;ign;
and I engaged to do as I was directed. I own,
madam, pur&s;ued &s;he, that though pity would have in|duced
me to a&s;&s;i&s;t one of my own &s;ex, I had &s;till a
nearer rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to deliver the young lady
out of her tyrant's hands.</P>
<P>I went immediately to Mi&s;s Arnold's chamber; &s;he
unlocked the door on my telling her I was the hou&s;e|keeper,
who came to offer her my &s;ervice. I cannot
expre&s;s to you, madam, the compa&s;&s;ion I felt on &s;eeing
&s;o young and hand&s;ome a lady fallen into the hands of
&s;uch a profligate. I a&s;ked her whether I could be any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her in dre&s;&s;ing? Alas! &s;aid &s;he, I have
nothing wherewith to dre&s;s my&s;elf; I have no cloaths
but what you &s;ee on me; I am a poor unfortunate
creature that have been trepanned hither I know not
how. I replied, (by way of founding her di&s;po&s;ition)
I under&s;tood, madam, that Sir Edward Audley was &s;o
happy as to have your affections, and that you meant
to make him your hu&s;band. They deceived you, &s;aid
&s;he eagerly; he never had my affections, nor whil&s;t I
have breath (cla&s;ping together her hands) will I ever
be his wife. But, madam, you are in his power;
how can you re&s;i&s;t, if he &s;hould make u&s;e of that
power to compell you? He cannot compell me to
<HI>&s;peak,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he; nor can I re&s;i&s;t if he and the
horrid ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e are determined on my
death, for that will be the con&s;equence of violence;
but remember I tell you, I am a young per&s;on of for|tune
and condition, and &s;ome people may revenge my
death, though they have for&s;aken me whil&s;t living.</P>
<P>I &s;aw by this, proceeded the young woman, that
the poor lady had been cruelly betrayed, and I
wanted to know no more, to re&s;olve on delivering her
from her per&s;ecutor. I took, however, the liberty of
a&s;king her name, if &s;he had no particular rea&s;on for
<PB N="107" REF="282">
keeping it &s;ecret. She informed me of it very
readily, with &s;ome other circum&s;tances relative to her
family. Take comfort, madam, &s;aid I; I promi&s;e to
deliver you &s;afe into your mama's hands before two
days are at an end. She looked at me as if doubtful
of my &s;incerity. I do not wonder, madam, added I,
that you &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t the hone&s;ty of every one in
this hou&s;e; you will find, neverthele&s;s, that I will keep
my word with you. As the keys of the outer doors
are committed to my tru&s;t every night, I can with the
greate&s;t ea&s;e &s;et you at liberty; it will not be difficult
to provide hor&s;es, if you can venture to ride; and
what is more, I will accompany you my&s;elf, and &s;ee
you &s;afe home.</P>
<P>You look, &s;aid &s;he, like an hone&s;t young per&s;on, yet
you <HI>may</HI> deceive me; but it would be a double crime
in <HI>you</HI> to join with <HI>men</HI> again&s;t a poor unhappy crea|ture
of your own &s;ex. I a&s;&s;ured her &s;he might depend
on the truth of what I &s;aid. God ble&s;s you, &s;aid &s;he,
my good young woman. Your virtue &s;hall not be unre|warded
<HI>here,</HI> no more than it will be hereafter. She even
embraced me, and &s;eemed in an extacy of joy. To
tell you the truth, &s;aid &s;he, I had re&s;olved to try if I
could prevail on the chamber-maid, to let me &s;teal out
to-night, when all the family were in bed. I intended
to have offered her all the money I have in my pocket,
and this ring into the bargain (to a hand&s;ome diamond
&s;he had on her finger). I was afraid to make the pro|po&s;al
to you; your appearance, and the &s;tation you
hold here, made me think you were not to be cor|rupted;
but I imagined an ordinary body might be
tempted by &s;uch a bribe; and once I got out, I would
have ran till I came to the fir&s;t hou&s;e that would have
given me &s;helter. I told the lady I was very glad &s;he
had no occa&s;ion to make the experiment, for be&s;ides
the impo&s;&s;ibility of any of the &s;ervants having it in
their power to let her out of the hou&s;e at night, &s;he
would have hazarded a di&s;covery of her de&s;ign, in
having made the propo&s;al of e&s;caping. I then coun|&s;eled
her to behave le&s;s &s;cornfully to Sir Edward, le&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="283">
it &s;hould provoke him to take any mea&s;ures that might
fru&s;trate our attempt. I cannot &s;hew him any kind|ne&s;s,
&s;aid &s;he, but I will endeavour not to exa&s;perate
him. Perceiving a bundle lying on her table, I open|ed
it, and found it full of fine linen of all &s;orts; the
chamber-maid had before told me, &s;he had received
&s;uch a parcel out of the chariot which had brought
the lady. I again a&s;ked Mi&s;s Arnold, would &s;he not
cho&s;e to dre&s;s? I know not, &s;aid &s;he, to whom the&s;e
things belong, yet I &s;hould like to change my linen,
and &s;ince they are here will put them on. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted
her; &s;he talked to me all the while, and &s;eemed in
extraordinary &s;pirits; yet I thought now and then &s;he
&s;poke a little out of the way; but I was at that time
far from &s;u&s;pecting that her head was di&s;ordered. I
advi&s;ed her not to let her joy appear, for fear it &s;hould
give &s;u&s;picions; &s;he promi&s;ed me &s;he would not, and
having informed her that at four o'clock the next
morning, I &s;hould be in readine&s;s to give her liberty
and attend her flight, I left her; taking care for the
re&s;t of the day, (by &s;eigning &s;till not to be well) to
prevent my ma&s;ter from calling me on any pretence
into the parlour.</P>
<P>It was lucky, &s;aid I, interrupting her in this place,
that Mr. Bendi&s;h did not name you in Sir Edward's
pre&s;ence; people u&s;ually call their hou&s;e-keepers by
their &s;ur-names, and Sir Edward Audley might pro|bably
have been alarmed at hearing your's. I had for
a certain rea&s;on, madam, &s;aid &s;he, changed my name,
when I fir&s;t hired with old Mrs. Bendi&s;h; I called
my&s;elf Spillman, but my maiden name is Williams.
You are then married? &s;aid I. Her having &s;aid her
<HI>maiden</HI> name, &s;ugge&s;ted this que&s;tion to me. The
poor thing blu&s;hed exceedingly, and an&s;wered in a
faltering kind of manner, Yes, madam; but it would
have been happy for me if I never had. Again I
perceived a tear &s;tart in her eye; but wiping it off,
&s;he proceeded: I know not what pa&s;&s;ed between Mi&s;s
Arnold and the gentleman for the remainder of that
day; I was only told, that &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf from
<PB N="109" REF="284">
dining with them, but that in the evening &s;he went
down to the parlour for half an hour, then retired
again to her chamber, where &s;he was &s;uffered to re|main
undi&s;turbed for the re&s;t of the night.</P>
<P>I took care in the interim to be provided with hor&s;es
again&s;t the appointed hour; and when all the family
were in bed, I &s;tole &s;oftly to Mi&s;s Arnold's chamber.
I found her up and dre&s;&s;ed. She had even her hood
and gloves on. She ran to me as &s;oon as I entered,
Are we ready to go, my good friend? &s;aid &s;he. I
told her it was but little more than midnight; and that
as my ma&s;ter often &s;at up much later, I had not dared
to order the hor&s;es &s;o &s;oon. I could have wi&s;hed,
madam, &s;aid I, that you had continued in bed, that
you might have got a little re&s;t, in order the better to
enable you to undertake your journey. She told me
&s;he had not been in bed at all, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the
maid who came to wait on her, and made her leave a
candle burning in her chamber. I had no inclination
to &s;leep, &s;aid &s;he, though I do not remember that I
clo&s;ed my eyes la&s;t night.</P>
<P>Her impatience was extreme till the hour of our
departure arrived; and I no &s;ooner told her that the
hor&s;es were at the gate (whither &s;he had &s;ent me at
lea&s;t twenty times before) than clinging to my arm
&s;he rather flew than walked down &s;tairs. We imme|diately
mounted; Mi&s;s Arnold cho&s;ing to ride behind
the man, I took the &s;ingle hor&s;e, and cold and dark as
it was, &s;et off joyfully on our journey; but the poor
lady could not dive&s;t her&s;elf of her fears; &s;he was
every minute apprehen&s;ive of being pur&s;ued; and
judging Sir Edward Audley would follow her on the
track to Woodberry, &s;he prevailed on her guide, by
the promi&s;e of a hand&s;ome reward, to &s;trike out of
the high road, and by bye ways make out his journey
to Oxford. I could not pur&s;uade her out of this
whim. The fellow undertook it; but not being well
enough acquainted with the country, he mi&s;&s;ed his
way, &s;o that after having rid thirty miles without hav|ing
it in our power to change hor&s;es, we found our|&s;elves
<PB N="110" REF="285">
&s;till at the &s;ame di&s;tance from our journey's
end. Mi&s;s Arnold was by this time &s;o extremely
fatigued that &s;he was unable to proceed; her eagerne&s;s
to get home was not however abated, and it was with
the utmo&s;t difficulty that I per&s;uaded her to &s;tay at the
inn where we then were till this morning, when
the people undertook to procure for us a chai&s;e, and I
promi&s;ed to &s;et out with her as early as &s;he plea&s;ed.
She continued exceedingly pen&s;ive and &s;ilent all day;
and as I lay in the &s;ame room with her, I am &s;ure &s;he
&s;carcely &s;lept the whole night. She ro&s;e, however,
at five o'clock this morning; and notwith&s;tanding the
earne&s;tne&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to pur&s;ue her journey, &s;he
&s;eemed &s;eized with deep melancholy, and hardly &s;poke
during the whole time that we travelled.</P>
<P>I thanked Mrs. Spillman as &s;he de&s;erved for the
timely &s;uccours &s;he had afforded my dear unhappy
child. It &s;hould &s;eem to me, that this is &s;ome poor
young per&s;on whom that mo&s;t abandoned of men Sir
Edward Audley has &s;educed; and probably &s;ome
little jealou&s;y, or even remains of love for her betray|er,
may have mixed them&s;elves with the more chari|table
motives of her conduct. Be that as it will, my
obligations to her are not the le&s;s, Gracious God,
what would have been my &s;tate if my daughter had
fallen a victim to the villain's profligacy! But my
mind is ea&s;y as to that particular, for &s;he told Mrs.
Spillman that Sir Edward Audley had never in his
whole behaviour towards her exceeded the bounds of
re&s;pect. The wretch's views &s;eem rather to have been
on her fortune than her per&s;on; for I cannot &s;uffer
my&s;elf to believe that either virtue or honour had any
&s;hare in re&s;training his licentiou&s;ne&s;s. By what wick|ed
contrivance he fir&s;t got her into his power, is the in|explicable
part of the &s;tory, for the poor child &s;eems
not now in a condition to inform us. It appears from
all I have learnt, that her fir&s;t unfortunate &s;tep was a
voluntary one; yet who knows what ba&s;e arts might
have been made u&s;e of to en&s;nare her into it? It is
plain, &s;he had no de&s;ign of putting her&s;elf into this man's
<PB N="111" REF="286">
hands; but I mu&s;t be content to remain in the dark
till &s;he is her&s;elf able and willing to clear up the my&s;|tery
to me. I dare believe we &s;hall find it a &s;cene of
treachery; at pre&s;ent I will not, by urging her to an
explanation, exa&s;perate the fatal malady which has
laid hold of her, and which this enquiry when I fir&s;t
made it &s;eemed to aggravate.</P>
<P>I am not of a &s;u&s;picious nature; yet &s;ome things
which my brother threw out when he was here with
regard to lady Audley, joined to this event, has a little
&s;hook the good opinion I had of her. How &s;hocked
&s;hould I be to find that either &s;he or her daughter had
any &s;hare in this wicked &s;cheme! Yet 'tis not <HI>impo&s;|&s;ible;</HI>
for I know Dolly was very fond of Mi&s;s Aud|ley.</P>
<P>My daughter Cecilia came in to us again in about an
hour. She &s;aid &s;he had per&s;uaded her &s;i&s;ter to lie
down, and &s;he was in hopes &s;he had left her in a
&s;lumber; for &s;he had &s;at the whole time by her bed|&s;ide,
and had not heard her either &s;pake or &s;tir. Sleep,
perhaps, may contribute to &s;ettle her poor di&s;turbed
mind. God grant it! yet I dare not indulge my&s;elf
in hope; I who now feel the bitterne&s;s of being
plunged again into &s;orrow, at a time when I thought
all the &s;torms of my life were pa&s;t, mu&s;t not &s;uffer my
heart to be &s;educed from its pre&s;ent &s;tate of mourn|ful
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by the flattery of my own imaginati|on.
I have left Cecilia to entertain our new gue&s;t,
who, though I know her not, has rendered us &s;ervices
too important not to merit every mark of friend&s;hip
and di&s;tinction which 'tis in our power to be&s;tow on
her. She would fain have taken her leave of us; but
I begged of her, if no particular bu&s;ine&s;s called her
away to make my hou&s;e her own, till her affairs were
in a more &s;ettled way, than it was probable from the
nature of her &s;ituation they could be in at pre&s;ent.
She thanked me with &s;tron$ expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude;
&s;aid &s;he had no other pro&s;pect but that of going to
&s;ervice again; and if I would allow her to remain
<PB N="112" REF="287">
in my hou&s;e till &s;he &s;hould find a place to &s;uit her, &s;he
&s;hould think her&s;elf very happy.</P>
<P>You know, my dear, I am apt to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at
fir&s;t &s;ight; I have taken a liking to this young per&s;on,
and if I find no material objection to her character,
&s;hould like to take her to &s;upply the place of Nel&s;on,
who is growing &s;o indolent and unwieldy, that &s;he can
but ill di&s;charge the duties of her employment. I do
not mean to part with the poor woman, I think 'tis
time to let her lie by. See how compo&s;edly, my
Cecilia, I talk of common matters, whil&s;t I have that
at my heart which weighs me down to the ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland went on a vi&s;it this morning to a par|ticular
friend of his, in order to take his leave, as he
&s;ets out the latter end of next week for Germany.
Friday is the day appointed for his marriage, as I told
you in my la&s;t, and he would not after that be willing
to &s;pare &s;o much time from his Cecilia; for the gen|tleman
whom he is gone to &s;ee, lives twelve miles
off, &s;o that we do not expect him home till to-mor|row.</P>
<P>What a dreadful &s;hock will it be to him, to find
his poor &s;i&s;ter in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate! Mr. Price thinks
it would be mo&s;t prudent to conceal, if po&s;&s;ible, her
melancholy &s;ituation from him, le&s;t he &s;hould embroil
him&s;elf with that wretched man Sir Edward Audley.
I am entirely of his mind; for who knows what fatal
con&s;equences might follow from Falkland's warmth,
if he &s;hould re&s;ent as it de&s;erves, and as he certainly
would, this unhappy affair. Yet it will be difficult to
keep from his knowlege that Mi&s;s Arnold is returned.
If my poor girl were in a condition to be rea&s;oned with
on that occa&s;ion, I am &s;ure &s;he would readily agree to
conceal her&s;elf$ in the hou&s;e till after his departure.
The family will then be at liberty to take &s;uch mea|&s;ures
as may be expedient. The laws, I think, on
tho&s;e occa&s;ions are the propere&s;t in&s;truments of cha&s;|ti&s;ement;
for I approve not of individuals taking the
rod of vengeance into their own proper hands.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="288">
Be &s;o good as to communicate this letter to my
brother, and to lady Sarah. I hope Sir George's &s;en|timents
on this &s;ubject will agree with tho&s;e of Mr.
Price and mine. Tell him I would have written to
him, but that I have &s;carcely &s;trength or &s;pirits to
fini&s;h this my long letter to you.</P>
<P>I know, my Cecilia, you will be anxious to learn
every circum&s;tance which pa&s;&s;es at this juncture, un|der
the melancholy roof of your friend; I &s;hall there|fore
inform you of them as they occur, and as I find
my&s;elf able to write. I conclude as I began; join
your prayers with mine, my dear, that it may plea&s;e
Heaven to re&s;tore peace to your di&s;con&s;olate, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ARNOLD to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>March 20th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Told you in my letter of ye&s;terday that Mr. Price
and I were of opinion that it would be mo&s;t ad|vi&s;able
to conceal from Mr. Falkland the knowlege of
my poor daughter's return. Upon con&s;ulting Cecilia
on the occa&s;ion, we found her exactly of our mind;
it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e her tenderne&s;s for the man whom
&s;he already looks upon as her hu&s;band, would alarm her
fears; yet is &s;he &s;o deeply affected with her &s;i&s;ter's &s;itu|ation,
that &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t repugnance at the
thoughts of giving him her hand at &s;o unhappy a
juncture, and urged Mr. Price and me to endeavour to
prevail on Mr. Falkland to po&s;tpone his marriage till
after his return to England. We both entered into her
&s;entiments &s;o far as to agree that this was not a hou&s;e
for Hymen to revel in; and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible,
with &s;o mournful an object in our thoughts, for
any of us to enjoy the &s;atisfaction which would
otherwi&s;e re&s;ult from her nuptials; yet how to ac|count
for the deferring them was the difficulty. What
<PB N="114" REF="289">
pretence could we make to Falkland for &s;o &s;udden, &s;o
&s;eemingly unrea&s;onable a change in our determinations?
He left us with the certain a&s;&s;urance of &s;eeing his
wi&s;hes crowned in three days. What a cruel di&s;ap|pointment
mu&s;t it then be to him to find all his hopes
overturned; and how could we an&s;wer to him &s;uch a
flagrant breach of promi&s;e? In &s;hort, after long can|va&s;&s;ing
the &s;ubject, we found it impo&s;&s;ible to acquit
our&s;elves to Mr. Falkland, without letting him into
the true motives of our conduct; and as that was
the thing of all others we mo&s;t wi&s;hed to avoid, we
were obliged to let matters re&s;t as they were, &s;o that
to-morrow remains the day fixed for the wedding.</P>
<P>After having di&s;patched my letter to you ye&s;ter|day,
I returned to the parlour, where I had left Ceci|lia
and Mrs. Spillman. I found Mr. Price with my
daughter; but the good young woman had begged
leave to be admitted to Mi&s;s Arnold's room, that &s;he
might watch by her bed-&s;ide till &s;he awoke, for the
poor dear girl was happily then in a profound &s;leep.
And it was in this interval that we had the conver&s;ati|on
that I have related to you.</P>
<P>The tranquil &s;lumber that the &s;weet child had now
enjoyed for more than two hours, began to flatter me
with &s;ome hope that we might find her in a more &s;et|tled
&s;tate of mind; and in that ca&s;e we re&s;olved to let
her into our de&s;ign with regard to concealing her ad|venture
from Falkland, on which account &s;he would
her&s;elf &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of our hiding her from his
&s;ight. But if, on the contrary, we found that her
thoughts continued in the &s;ame unhappy frame, we
determined to keep her in her chamber, under pretence
that her uncle Bidulph was come down to look for.
her for Mrs. Spillman had told me that Mi&s;s Arnold
had expre&s;&s;ed great terrors (&s;he knew not why) at the
thoughts of &s;eeing him, and &s;aid &s;he was flying to me
in order to avoid him when &s;he was en&s;nared to Mr.
Bendi&s;h's hou&s;e. We agreed al&s;o to &s;ay that Mr.
Falkland was already departed for the army; and
<PB N="115" REF="290">
we re&s;olved that Cecilia, Mr. Price, Mrs. Spillman,
and my&s;elf, &s;hould &s;it with her alternately till &s;uch time
as we &s;hould all be at liberty to change our proceed|ings.</P>
<P>Having thus, in the be&s;t manner we could, &s;ettled
our mea&s;ures, and given the nece&s;&s;ary orders to the
&s;ervants, I de&s;ired Mrs. Spillman might be called down
to dine with us. She &s;ent me word that Mi&s;s Arnold
was ju&s;t awakened, and had a&s;ked for a di&s;h of choco|late;
but that if I would allow her to dine in the
young lady's room, &s;he might per&s;uade her to take
&s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial, as &s;he had eaten very little
for the three la&s;t days. I ordered &s;omething to be
immediately carried up &s;tairs, and flew my&s;elf to the
poor creature's chamber. I found her awake, but &s;till
lying on her bed. She &s;tretched out her hand as &s;oon
as &s;he &s;aw me. I gave her mine. She drew it to her
lips, ki&s;&s;ed it &s;everal times&mdash;but did not &s;peak. How
do you find your&s;elf, my dear? Not quite &s;o ill as I
was, madam, yet I feel my&s;elf very feeble. No won|der,
my child, you have neither &s;lept nor eat for &s;ome
days pa&s;t. I pre&s;&s;ed her to take &s;omething of what
had been brought up to Mrs. Spillman. She ta&s;ted a
little bit; but it &s;eemed in mere complai&s;ance to me,
for &s;he &s;aid &s;he had no appetite.</P>
<P>She enquired for her &s;i&s;ter. She is below &s;tairs, &s;aid
I; &s;he and Mr. Price are at dinner together. She beg|ged
I would go to them; &s;aid &s;he was very &s;orry I had
di&s;turbed my&s;elf to come to her; and that Mrs. Spill|man
would be &s;o kind as to &s;it with her till we had
done dinner, when &s;he &s;hould be glad to join us in the
parlour. I was delighted to hear her talk &s;o compo&s;ed|ly.
I will go down to them, my dear, &s;aid I; and
by-and-by we will all attend you in your chamber:
for your &s;pirits &s;eem fatigued, and I would not have
you quit it to-day. As you plea&s;e for that, madam;
but am I not to &s;ee Mr. Falkland? He is not here at
pre&s;ent, my love&mdash;Ah, mama! I am afraid all
<PB N="116" REF="291">
is not right&mdash;Why did poor Cecilia weep to-day,
I believe Falkland has left her. He has not, indeed
Dolly; if your &s;i&s;ter wept, it was only at the thoughts
of your &s;ufferings&mdash;The dear girl! &s;aid &s;he, how kind
that is of her! but I know &s;he loves me. We will
not then, mama, talk of my &s;ufferings, &s;ince it gives
her &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s; pray let them not be men|tioned
to her or Mr. Falkland; I would not for the
world make them unhappy. How plea&s;ed was I to
hear my poor child expre&s;s her&s;elf thus! It was, as
you &s;ee, half way meeting our intentions, and &s;pared
me the pain of deceiving her. You judge very right|ly,
my dear, &s;aid I; it would afflict Mr. Falkland be|yond
mea&s;ure, if he were to know how you have been
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and perhaps engage him in a quarrel. Ah,
mama, that would be terrible! for God's &s;ake, let him
not know it.&mdash;Poor Orlando! I would not hurt
a hair of his head.&mdash;Then wringing my hand
tenderly, Pray leave me, mama; you have not dined
yet; you give your&s;elf too much trouble about me.
I dropped a tear of pity, mingled with &s;atisfaction, at
finding her, as I thought, though not recovered, yet
much more calm in her mind, and, to all appearance,
much more rea&s;onable. I left her, and went down
&s;tairs; where I rejoiced the affectionate hearts of Mr.
Price and my Cecilia with the account I gave them of
her.</P>
<P>After dinner we all went up again to her chamber.
She was &s;till lying on her bed; but on Mr. Price's en|tering,
whom &s;he had not yet &s;een, &s;he &s;prung up to
receive him. With what tenderne&s;s did the good man
acco&s;t her! and how affectionately did &s;he return his
care&s;&s;es! Mrs. Spillman whi&s;pered me, that &s;he had
not &s;poke a word from the time I left her, but &s;eemed
to be buried in &s;adne&s;s. I told Mr. Price &s;oftly that
we mu&s;t endeavour to divert her, without mentioning
any &s;ubject which could make her recur to her own
melancholy thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="292">
I believe, my dear, you may remember to have
heard me &s;ay that this fine old man has a peculiar
knack at introducing a conver&s;ation. Few people
have the art to enter &s;uddenly into any regular &s;eries
of di&s;cour&s;e without a forced and abrupt, or, at be&s;t,
an aukward appearance; yet he is &s;o extremely happy
in his manner, that he can at once engage and intere&s;t
you in his &s;ubject, without your perceiving how you
had been led into it. He exerci&s;ed this talent very
&s;ucce&s;sfully on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and &s;oon caught
Dolly's attention, who &s;eemed to li&s;ten to him with
plea&s;ure. As for Cecilia, &s;he was all ear. I took this
opportunity of beckoning Mrs. Spillman out of the
room, in order to have a little conver&s;ation with her.
As it was nece&s;&s;ary to conceal <HI>her</HI> from Mr. Falkland's
&s;ight, as well as my daughter, le&s;t the appearance of
a &s;tranger &s;hould put him on making any enquiries, I
thought it was proper to apprize her of our de&s;ign.
After having done this, I told her I hoped &s;he would
excu&s;e my making a pri&s;oner of her in Mi&s;s Arnold's
chamber while Mr. Falkland was in the hou&s;e. She
&s;aid nothing could give her greater plea&s;ure than the
being allowed to attend on the young lady. I ob|&s;erved
&s;he coloured at the fir&s;t mention of Mr. Falk|land's
name, and &s;eemed very much di&s;concerted. Af|ter
I had communicated to her what I had to &s;ay with
regard to him, I a&s;ked her if &s;he knew him? She
an&s;wered, I believe I have &s;een him, madam; at lea&s;t
I remember to have &s;een a gentleman of that name
with Sir Edward Audley, though I did not then know
who he was. 'Tis very likely, replied I; Sir Edward
and he were intimately acquainted. Ah, madam, had
Mr. Falkland known Sir Edward's character, &s;aid &s;he,
I think he would have been cautious in forming any
connection with him.</P>
<P>I perceived her heart was open, and that &s;he &s;eem|ed
inclined to communicate her own &s;tory, which &s;he
<PB N="118" REF="293">
had promi&s;ed to relate to me. I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome cu|rio&s;ity
to know it, and &s;he told me what follows.</P>
<P>[Mrs. Arnold here briefly gives the &s;ub&s;tance of this
young woman's unhappy &s;tory, with which the reader
is already acquainted in Mr. Main's letters to his &s;i&s;ter
A&s;kham. She then proceeds:]</P>
<P>I have given you the purport of this unfortunate
girl's narrative, though in much fewer words than &s;he
employed to relate it. Why, what an accompli&s;hed
villain is this Sir Edward Audley! I do not doubt the
truth of what this poor young creature has told me.
The air of candor and &s;implicity with which &s;he &s;poke,
and the tears &s;he &s;hed during her recital, convince me
of her veracity. She appealed to Mr. Main (who&s;e
integrity we both know) for the truth of many parti|culars;
and added, &s;he was &s;ure he was thoroughly
&s;atisfied of her innocence, and the wrongs &s;he had
&s;uffered. What an e&s;cape has my poor child had from
this execrable man! and how naturally can Mrs. Spill|man's
conduct be now accounted for! She &s;aid, &s;he
had no hopes of Sir Edward's ever acknowleging her;
yet &s;he owned &s;he could not bear the thoughts of his
marrying another. The account &s;he gave me of her|&s;elf,
has increa&s;ed my compa&s;&s;ion and e&s;teem for her;
yet I cannot think of retaining <HI>lady Audley</HI> (for &s;uch &s;he
certainly is) as a &s;ervant in my hou&s;e. I mu&s;t find out
a more &s;uitable way of &s;hewing her my gratitude. I
a&s;ked her, if &s;he thought Mr. Falkland had been any
way privy to the treachery which had been practi&s;ed
again&s;t her? She a&s;&s;ured me, that &s;he did not believe
he was; adding, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Falkland con|&s;idered
her in no other light than that of a woman
kept by Sir Edward Audley. I was very glad to hear
her make this declaration, as it would have given me
a dreadful impre&s;&s;ion of Falkland, could I have thought
him capable of being an accomplice $word$ &s;o black an af|fair.
I am not, however, plea&s;ed to $ind the$ he was
even &s;o far in his wicked companion's confidence as to
<PB N="119" REF="294">
be acquainted with any of his loo&s;e &s;ecrets. I ble&s;s
God that he has not been corrupted by the contagion
of bad example, again&s;t which it is &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to
guard a young man, once he launches out into the
world. Orlando has been carefully brought up; and
I hope a natural good di&s;po&s;ition, co-operating with
a virtuous education, will always prove an antidote
again&s;t the poi&s;on of vice. I have now double cau&s;e
to pray for his continuance in the paths of uprightne&s;s
he has hitherto trodden.</P>
<P>On my return to my daughter's chamber, I found
my two children &s;till together. Mr. Price had ju&s;t
retired to take, as is his cu&s;tom, his evening's nap.
Dolly was helping Cecilia to &s;prig &s;ome fine mu&s;lin
that &s;he is now working for an apron. On my enter|ing
the room, &s;he ran to me, and whi&s;pering me in
the ear, I have not &s;aid a word of the matter &s;ince,
mama, &s;aid &s;he, for fear of making poor Cecilia cry;
I cannot bear to &s;ee her tears. I replied, You did
well, my dear; and I have been telling Mrs. Spillman
the precautions we intend to u&s;e to keep this whole af|fair
from Mr. Falkland's knowlege. He leaves us next
week, in order to &s;et out for his regiment; and if, for
the few days that he remains here, you will con&s;ent to
keep your&s;elf concealed in your chamber, he need not
know of your being in the hou&s;e. Oh, with all my
heart, madam, &s;aid &s;he, it will be better &s;o; the &s;ight
of me might affect him too much.&mdash;Poor Falk|land!
I would not &s;hock him upon any account. But
when do you expect him here $word$ for I have a notion he
will &s;teal away to the army without &s;eeing any of you.
By no means, my dear, we expect him home to-mor|row;
for Friday is the day fixed for his marriage with
your &s;i&s;ter. Indeed! &s;tarting, and looking at Cecilia:
then turning to me, and &s;peaking very low, Do not
believe it, mama, &s;aid &s;he: I am certain he does not
mean to marry her till he returns again to England;
for by that time the whole affair will be forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="295">
I &s;aw my poor child's imagination, filled with the
idea of her own &s;ufferings, was &s;traying wide from the
purpo&s;e of our di&s;cour&s;e, and at the &s;ame time con|founding
together circum&s;tances, which were in no|wi&s;e
connected. I was too much affected to be able
to make any an&s;wer; and &s;he added, &s;till &s;peaking &s;o
low as that her &s;i&s;ter &s;hould not hear her, Oh, you do
not know, mama, what di&s;&s;emblers men are! As near
as you have brought the wedding-day, you will &s;ee
Falkland will give you the &s;lip: and &s;he &s;miled a little;
then added, But I am &s;ure he will have my &s;i&s;ter when
he comes back, becau&s;e he loves her as he does his
life, and there will be nothing then to hinder him.&mdash;
Poor dear creature! the villainy of that vile Sir Ed|ward
has made her di&s;tru&s;tful of his whole &s;ex, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her with a belief that Falkland will deceive
her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>We were interrupted ju&s;t here by the arrival of a
neighbouring lady and her daughter, who came to pa&s;s
the evening with us. Cecilia and I were obliged to go
down to receive them, and we left Mrs. Spillman with
Dolly.</P>
<P>The ladies &s;tayed &s;o late, that I &s;aw my poor
daughter but for a few minutes the re&s;t of the evening.
Mrs. Spillman per&s;uaded her to go to bed early, as &s;he
had had &s;o little &s;leep for &s;ome preceding nights. We
have put a little tent-bed into her chamber, in which
this good young body lies. We all breakfa&s;ted in her
room this morning. She &s;eems compo&s;ed, but over|whelmed
with &s;adne&s;s; and her charming face is &s;o
altered! it almo&s;t breaks my heart to look at her.
Cecilia can &s;carce refrain from tears, even in her pre|&s;ence.&mdash;</P>
<P>They tell me Mr. Falkland is this minute returned.
I will ju&s;t &s;ee him, and then fini&s;h my letter. I am
glad of a little relaxation; for I am quite tired with
writing.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="296">
I found him with his Cecilia. What joy at meeting
again! If a &s;ingle day's ab&s;ence has appeared &s;o
grievous, how much are they to be pitied who are &s;o
&s;oon to feel a &s;eparation, which may la&s;t many,
many tedious months! Nay, heaven knows&mdash;but I
will not forebode: 'tis nothing but my own gloomy
thoughts which &s;ugge&s;t to me apprehen&s;ions, I hope,
without foundation; for does Falkland run any
greater ri&s;que than hundreds of other gallant men
who accompany him?</P>
<P>I &s;hall be able to dedicate but little of my time to
my poor girl to-day. Falkland's pre&s;ence will be a
re&s;traint on Cecilia and me; and we can only &s;ee her
by &s;tarts.</P>
<P>I intended here to have clo&s;ed my letter; but upon
&s;econd thoughts, I will leave it open till to-morrow,
when I &s;hall have the important article of my daugh|ter's
marriage to conclude with. It is not the thing
of my choice; yet I hope my children will be happy.
They are both worthy; and for the goods of for|tune,
they will have more than &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I endeavour to be chearful, that Falkland may not
have any room to imagine that I repent of having
given a con&s;ent, which was indeed wrung from me;
yet my &s;pirits are &s;adly depre&s;&s;ed; and, God knows,
ill di&s;po&s;ed to celebrate a fe&s;tivity &s;o joyful as that of
matrimony <HI>ought</HI> to be.</P>
<P>We are to have no one pre&s;ent at the ceremony but
Mrs. A&s;kham, Nel&s;on, and the butler: for poor
Frederick Hildy would be mi&s;erable, if he were not
allowed to &s;ee his young ma&s;ter, as he has always
called Mr. Falkland, married to <HI>Madam</HI> Cecilia; for
that is the title which he gives to both my daughters.
The&s;e two, therefore, have begged to be admitted
into the chamber, as Mr. Price, you know, is to
perform the office in my hou&s;e. Adieu then, my
dear, till to-morrow.&mdash;</P>
<P>Friday evening, <DATE>March 22d.</DATE></P>
<P>I am writing to you on my knees, Cecilia; for
that po&s;ture be&s;t becomes one on whom the Almighty
<PB N="122" REF="297">
pours out his wrath like a deluge! Yet I will not
a&s;k of Providence why, in the evening of an unhappy
life, not, I think, &s;tained with any peculiar guilt, I
am thus overwhelmed with &s;uch tempe&s;tuous &s;or|rows!
I thought the &s;torm was pa&s;t; but it re|doubles
on my head, and I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ink under it.&mdash;Yet
be comforted, my dear, there is <HI>another</HI> world.
There, there do I look &s;or recompence for my almo&s;t
unprecedented &s;ufferings here.</P>
<P>You will tremble when I tell you, Cecilia, that
Falkland&mdash;Oh, God! that boy, whom I have &s;o
tenderly educated, and &s;o dearly loved, that very
Falkland is the viper who now $$ings me to death!
You cannot credit it, I am &s;ure; but I'll try to recal
my di&s;tracted thoughts, &s;o as to enable me to relate
to you what this dreadful day has unravelled.</P>
<P>Dolly had been informed ye&s;terday that Mr. Falk|land
was returned. She expre&s;&s;ed not any de&s;ire to
&s;ee him; but &s;eemed to have her thoughts extremely
agitated the whole day. Mrs. Spillman a&s;ked her the
cau&s;e of it, (for Cecilia and I were but little with
her.) Her replies were broken and imperfect; yet
Mrs. Spillman imagined they implied a &s;u&s;picion that
Falkland would not marry her &s;i&s;ter: for &s;he &s;aid &s;he
pitied poor Cecilia&mdash;yet &s;he mu&s;t bear her di&s;ap|pointment
for a while&mdash;for after the death of a
certain per&s;on, there would be nothing to hinder her
nuptials. We attributed this merely to the di&s;order
of her poor head; little imagining that &s;he had a
fatal rea&s;on for talking thus, which &s;he kept con|cealed
in her heart.</P>
<P>Cecilia thought it would make her ea&s;y, if &s;he
were convinced the marriage was really going to be
&s;olemnized. I was of the &s;ame opinion: in con&s;e|quence
of which, this morning, when Cecilia was
dre&s;&s;ed in her wedding-cloaths, I led her into her
&s;i&s;ter's chamber. You look very pretty, my dear,
&s;aid Dolly; white becomes you extremely. Are you
going abroad? (ob&s;erving her more ornamented than
u&s;ual.) You &s;ee your &s;i&s;ter in her bridal habit, &s;aid
I&punc; take her by the hand, my love; for &s;he is ju&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="298">
now going to give it away for ever to Mr. Falkland.
Ah, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, mama! &s;aid &s;he. I am &s;ure he
does not mean it; though perhaps you have impo&s;ed
on him, and he thinks that &s;omebody is already in
their grave. We knew not what to conjecture from
her incoherent words; yet fancied by that <HI>&s;omebody</HI>
&s;he meant Sir Edward Audley, again&s;t whom Falk|land,
believing him dead, no longer entertained any
thoughts of vengeance. This was the idea which,
without having time to reflect, &s;truck me, and, I
believe, entered at the &s;ame time into Cecilia's mind.
Oh, how far were we from gue&s;&s;ing the true object
at whom the dear unhappy creature pointed! Cecilia
embraced her, to hide her own emotion. Compo&s;e
your thoughts, my dear, &s;aid &s;he; all your friends
intere&s;t them&s;elves equally to make you ea&s;y. She
knew not what to &s;ay to her. I with difficulty re|&s;trained
my tears, and thought it be&s;t to break away
before I melted quite, le&s;t my di&s;order &s;hould be
ob&s;erved by Falkland, who was waiting for us in Mr.
Price's &s;tudy. Come, my Cecilia, &s;aid I, we are
expected below &s;tairs; we will return again to Dolly,
after Mr. Price has given you the nuptial ble&s;&s;ing.
I took her by the hand; My dear (to Dolly) you will
congratulate your &s;i&s;ter pre&s;ently by the name of Mrs.
Falkland, Dolly made me no reply; but throwing
her&s;elf into an arm-chair, &s;eemed for a minute lo&s;t in
thought: then lifting up her eyes to heaven, Poor
wretch, &s;aid &s;he, what will become of him!&mdash;We
referred every thing &s;he &s;aid to her own unhappy
adventure; the particular circum&s;tances of which
being ignorant of, we knew not what turn it would
be be&s;t to give our replies. Shall I &s;end Mrs. Spill|man
to you, my dear? &s;aid I. She had &s;lipped out of
the room ju&s;t as we entered, after having &s;poken a
few words to Dolly, which I did not hear. You
need not, madam, &s;he replied; &s;he &s;aid &s;he would
return immediately: &s;he is gone but to put on clean
linen. Poor thing! &s;he confines her&s;elf &s;adly to me.
I had indeed ob&s;erved that Mrs. Spillman was in
extreme di&s;habille, being ju&s;t as &s;he had ri&s;en out of
<PB N="124" REF="299">
bed. I had given her a clo&s;et above &s;tairs to dre&s;s
and keep her things in; for &s;he had brought &s;ome
cloaths with her. I &s;tepped up to her directly, and
found her combing her hair. Let me beg of you,
my good friend, &s;aid I, to ha&s;ten down to Mi&s;s
Arnold. The poor child mu&s;t not be le&s;t alone:
her own reflections are but mournful companions.
I did not think, madam, &s;aid &s;he, that you would
have made her &s;o &s;hort a vi&s;it, or I &s;hould not have
quitted the room; but I took the opportunity of
your being with her ju&s;t to &s;lip out for a few mi|nutes,
in order to make my&s;elf a little decent: for I
judged that neither you nor Mi&s;s Cecilia could have
much time to &s;pend with her to day; but I will get
my things on as quick as po&s;&s;ible, and attend her. I
begged &s;he would; and was returning again to
Dolly's chamber, where I had left Cecilia, when I
met Mrs. A&s;kham in the lobby. She had ju&s;t come
up &s;tairs. Mr. Falkland is impatient, madam, &s;aid
&s;he, &s;miling, and has &s;ent me to ha&s;ten the bride;
and Mr. Price &s;ays he will chide her for making them
wait &s;o long. I did not dare to venture my own
firmne&s;s again with the &s;ight of my poor child; and
fearful that Falkland him&s;elf might take the liberty of
coming to &s;eek her, if &s;he &s;taid any longer, I &s;ent Mrs.
A&s;kham in to lead out Cecilia, and went down &s;tairs
my&s;elf; they followed me directly.</P>
<P>We found the good old man in his canonical habit;
Falkland, elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;tanding by his &s;ide.
The agitations of his mind were &s;trongly painted on
his face: I thought then his emotions proceeded
from no other cau&s;e but what his pre&s;ent &s;ituation
might naturally in&s;pire. Oh, I knew not that a
con&s;cience &s;tained with guilt upbraided him in that
moment of approaching happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nel&s;on and the butler were the only two &s;ervants
that were admitted. I believe, &s;aid Mr. Price, ri&s;ing
and looking at his watch as we entered the room,
that we do not wait for any more company; with
your good leave, madam, we will not delay the
ceremony. I bowed, and all pre&s;ent ranging them|&s;elves
<PB N="125" REF="300">
in the proper order, Mr. Price began the office;
when coming to that part of the exhortation which
&s;ays, <HI>I require and charge you both, as you &s;hall an&s;wer
it at the dreadful day of judgment when the &s;ecrets of
all hearts &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed, that if either of you know
of any impediment,</HI> &amp;c. which words he pronounced
with that energy which accompanies him in all acts
of devotion, having, by I know not what chance,
ca&s;t my eyes at Falkland, I ob&s;erved he &s;hook from
head to foot; his face was as pale as death, and
I &s;aw he could &s;carcely &s;upport him&s;elf on his legs.
I thought he was &s;eized with &s;ome &s;udden illne&s;s, and
in my fright was going to interrupt the ceremony, to
a&s;k him how he did, when it was indeed interrupted
in a manner that makes my blood &s;till run cold with
horror! We heard a little bu&s;tle at the chamber
door, as if two per&s;ons was &s;truggling; it la&s;ted not
an in&s;tant, for the door was violently bur&s;t open,
and in ru&s;hed my dear unfortunate di&s;tracted child,
whom Mrs. Spillman in vain had been endeavouring
to hold back. Mr. Price was ju&s;t then making that
&s;olemn demand of <HI>Wilt thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife?</HI> She gave a piercing &s;hriek, and flying
to Falkland, &s;eized his hand, This hand is <HI>mine,</HI> &s;aid
&s;he: Oh, Falkland, you cannot till my eyes are
clo&s;ed give it to another!&mdash;Falkland dropped &s;en&s;e|le&s;s
at her feet.</P>
<P>A general con&s;ternation now &s;pread it&s;elf through
the little a&s;&s;embled congregation; the &s;ervants ran to
the &s;uccour of the unhappy wretch who lay extended
on the floor. Dolly &s;till gra&s;ping his hand dropped
on her knees by him, then &s;eating her&s;elf on the floor,
&s;he laid his head gently on her lap, bathing his face
with her tears. Cecilia &s;tood agha&s;t by their &s;ide;
and Mr. Price, with grief and amazement in his
looks, in &s;ilence fixed his eyes on this mournful
picture. What were <HI>my</HI> feelings in this dreadful
interval? No, Cecilia, they cannot be de&s;cribed;
my &s;en&s;ations were &s;trange! they were terrible! and
unfelt before! The fatal truth ru&s;hed on my ima|gination
at once, and all my poor child's disjointed
<PB N="126" REF="301">
words occurring to my memory, appeared now but
too well explained. She continued weeping over
him, while Mrs. A&s;kham and the &s;ervants were
u&s;ing vain endeavours to recover him. He is dead,
&s;aid &s;he, he returns to me no more!&mdash;Look,
mama, I have killed your poor Orlando!&mdash;Indeed
I did not mean to do &s;o, God knows I would have
given my own life to have pre&s;erved his&mdash;I thought
but to have &s;aved him from a crime.&mdash;I per|ceived
that Falkland was now coming to him&s;elf&mdash;
He begins to recover, &s;aid I to Mr. Price; perhaps
$word$ &s;ight of the&s;e injured faces may make him again
relaple into a fit; let us retire, and leave him to the
care of the &s;ervants. Mr. Price, without an&s;wering
me, took Cecilia by the hand, and led her out of the
room, Mrs. Spillman and I rai&s;ed Dolly almo&s;t by
force, for &s;he would fain have &s;taid by Falkland,
who now opening his eyes, &s;tared wildly about him
like one awakened from the dead; but we hurried
her out of the room, and almo&s;t choaked as &s;he was
with &s;obs, conducted her to that where Mr. Price
and Cecilia were together.</P>
<P>We let her give a free cour&s;e to her tears for &s;ome
time, in hopes that might lighten the burden of woe
under which her mind had laboured. I was even
plea&s;ed to &s;ee her weep, it was the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;he
had &s;hewn &s;ince her grievous malady had &s;eized her of
that tender &s;en&s;ibility which was always her cha|racteri&s;tic;
and I was in hopes was an indication of
returning rea&s;on, as in effect &s;he &s;oon after appeared
more collected. She had di&s;clo&s;ed an important
&s;ecret, the concealment of which had &s;o long hung
upon her heart. She had given vent to her &s;orrow;
and the&s;e two circum&s;tances, added to the &s;udden
f$ight &s;he had received from the apprehen&s;ion that
Falkland was dead, had, if not re&s;tored her rea&s;on,
yet at lea&s;t called back her recollection.</P>
<P>Having a little compo&s;ed her by a&s;&s;urances that
Falkland was perfectly come to him&s;elf, I thought I
might venture to que&s;tion her tenderly on the &s;ubject
of this amazing event, It &s;eems to me, my dear,
<PB N="127" REF="302">
&s;aid I, that Falkland has deceived you; was he then
a lover of your's? Ah, mama, I dare not look at
you, (clapping both her hands before her eyes) I
have been a rebel&mdash;I have been a di&s;obedient
wretch, and de&s;erved in my turn to be puni&s;hed by
ingratitude; yet Falkland ought not to have im|po&s;ed
on me. I &s;hould not have blamed him for
loving Cecilia; I know &s;he is hand&s;omer and more
amiable than I am.&mdash;Did he make love to you
before he addre&s;&s;ed your &s;i&s;ter? Oh, yes, yes, and
gave me his promi&s;e, and had mine in return; I
have been a &s;ad undutiful creature;&mdash;but I am
heavily cha&s;ti&s;ed for it.&mdash;And did Falkland a&s;&s;ign no
cau&s;e for thus cruelly for&s;aking you? Ah, that is
the harde&s;t thing of all. I thought the &s;hame of it
would have killed me. Indeed it <HI>had</HI> like to have
di&s;turbed my rea&s;on.&mdash;What was it, my dear?
Why, he &s;aid he had always been in love with
Cecilia, and that his pretended love to me was but
the returns of gratitude&mdash;He had found then
that <HI>you</HI> loved <HI>him</HI> before he declared him&s;elf to
you? The dear creature again covered her innocent
face to hide her blu&s;hes. Ah, mama, 'tis a di&s;grace|ful
&s;tory; do not urge me on that head&mdash;yet Falk|land
&s;hould never have known it, if it had not been
for Mi&s;s Audley. She told it to her brother, and he
a&s;&s;ured <HI>her</HI> that Falkland loved me. So you &s;ee each
was informed of the other's mind before we came to
any explanations.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her &s;everal more que&s;tions, and though &s;he
was not very preci&s;e in her an&s;wers, I could ea&s;ily
gather that the two Audleys had been the in&s;truments
to encourage and carry on this fatal connection.
Will you inform me, my dear, &s;aid I, (&s;ince we
know the mo&s;t material part of your &s;ecret) to what
end you went to that hou&s;e at Brumpton, &s;ince it
was owing to that unfortunate &s;tep that you fell
into the hands of Sir Edward Audley? She was &s;ilent
for a little while, and &s;eemed as if endeavouring
to recollect &s;omething that had &s;lipped her memory.
At length, I do not remember, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>all</HI> the
<PB N="128" REF="303">
circum&s;tances of that affair; but I think I went to
that hou&s;e to meet Mr. Falkland.&mdash;He writ to me to
come to him there; I have his letter &s;till in my pocket.
She immediately produced a letter in Falkland's
hand to that effect. We all examined it by turns: I
thought Cecilia would have expired at the reading of
it. It was plain this mi&s;erable wretch had betrayed
her into the hands of his horrid a&s;&s;ociate! Good
God, what a &s;cene of iniquity was here di&s;clo&s;ed!
The whole my&s;tery was now unravelled. I think,
proceeded my poor child, that I was very ill whil&s;t I
was at Brumpton; but I could get no body to come
near me, though Sir Edward Audley told all my
friends the melancholy condition I was in: Fal&s;e,
fal&s;e man! You &s;ee in every in&s;tance how the poor
creature was deceived! Lady Sarah, indeed, added
&s;he, threatened to &s;end my uncle to me; and it was
to avoid his terrible anger that I de&s;ired to be &s;ent to
my mama; but they catched me in a trap by the
way.&mdash;Mrs. Spillman can tell you how cruelly, I was
treated, 'twas a mercy they did not turn my brain
among&s;t them. Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, my beloved,
&s;aid I, you are now out of the reach of all harm.&mdash;
Do you call me your <HI>beloved!</HI> &s;aid &s;he: Oh, mama,
I do not de&s;erve &s;o much tenderne&s;s. She dropped
her head on my &s;houlder, ki&s;&s;ing my neck through
my handkerchief. Mrs. A&s;kham entered the room,
and whi&s;pered Mr. Price, who immediately went out.
I a&s;ked her &s;oftly the occa&s;ion of it; &s;he told me that
Mr. Falkland had de&s;ired to &s;peak with him alone.</P>
<P>Dolly ro&s;e up; &s;he approached her &s;i&s;ter, and cla&s;p|ing
her arms about her neck.&mdash;Ah, my poor Cecilia,
&s;aid &s;he, I am afraid I have broke her heart! but
pray do not die, my love; <HI>I</HI> am the victim who mu&s;t
fall; and then you may be happy; a promi&s;e does not
reach beyond the grave.&mdash;What an ill-fated wretch
I am, to have di&s;turbed the happine&s;s of the two
creatures in the world, whom I love be&s;t!&mdash;Say
rather, my dear, &s;aid Cecilia, that you have been the
in&s;trument of providence to prevent the greate&s;t
misfortune that could have befallen me; for how
<PB N="129" REF="304">
mi&s;erable &s;hould I have been, had I married&punc; Falkland!
You <HI>could</HI> not, whil&s;t I lived, &s;aid Dolly, without
making him commit a great &s;in; but when I am gone,
indeed, my &s;i&s;ter, you mu&s;t marry poor Orlando; mu&s;t
&s;he not, mama?</P>
<P>It was not a &s;ubject to be argued upon; I thought
it better to change the di&s;cour&s;e: We will talk of this
another time, my dear, &s;aid I; mean while I think
it will be be&s;t that Falkland &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf from
us for a while; I &s;uppo&s;e you will neither of
you think it prudent to &s;ee him before he goes. I
do not de&s;ire to &s;ee him, &s;aid Dolly; the &s;ight of me
perhaps might make him &s;woon away again, and I
would not willingly di&s;tre&s;s him. Nor I, &s;aid Cecilia.
She &s;aw I wanted to get rid of the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Mrs. A&s;kham took the hint, and reque&s;ting of Ce|cilia
to &s;hew her &s;ome pretty drawings. of which &s;he
had lately made a purcha&s;e; my daughter a&s;ked her
to come up to her clo&s;et, and they took Dolly with
them. I begged of Mrs. A&s;kham, as &s;he went out,
to &s;tay and pa&s;s the day with us, and to prevent as
much as po&s;&s;ible, the conver&s;ation's turning on the
recent mi&s;erable event.</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Spillman was almo&s;t afraid to &s;ee me, le&s;t
I &s;hould blame her negligence, which had occa&s;ioned
&s;o much di&s;order; but I told her the hand of Heaven
had directed the whole. She &s;aid, that after I had
left her, having huddled on her cloaths with all the
expedition in her power, &s;he had immediately gone
down to Mi&s;s Arnold's room, when not finding her
there, &s;he ran, in the utmo&s;t fright, down &s;tairs, and
overtook the unhappy child, ju&s;t as &s;he had reached
the door of the chamber where we were, and from
whence all her efforts could not draw her; &s;he had
even pretty &s;everely hurt Mrs. Spillman's hand, whil&s;t
&s;he was endeavouring to hinder her from turning the
bolt of the lock.</P>
<P>I was impatient to &s;ee Mr. Price, to know what
had pa&s;&s;ed between him and his wretched pupil. He
returned into the parlour to me in about an hour;
<PB N="130" REF="305">
his venerable countenance clouded with &s;hame and
di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>He told me that Falkland, on his entering the room,
appeared to him like a de&s;pairing wretch, &s;urrounded
with the horrors of his own guilt. Do not think, &s;ir,
&s;aid he, that I have &s;ent for you, to enter into a ju&s;ti|fication
of my&s;elf; &s;o far from it, I acknowledge my|&s;elf
the criminal, which I &s;uppo&s;e you now know me
to be. I &s;hall re&s;erve to another time the full expla|nation
of my whole crime; I would only for the pre|&s;ent
entreat the favour of you to an&s;wer me a few
que&s;tions.</P>
<P>He then a&s;ked when, and by what means, Mi&s;s Ar|nold
had returned home? Mr. Price informed him
minutely, and failed not to enlarge in a manner the
mo&s;t affecting on the poor creature's frenzy. He &s;aid,
Falkland at this recital &s;tarted off his chair, and, in
an agony of pa&s;&s;ion, cur&s;ed him&s;elf as the author of
&s;uch dreadful evils as he had brought upon my hou&s;e.
His tutor then repeated to him word for word the
conver&s;ation I had had with Dolly after we had left
him ju&s;t recovered from his &s;woon. He li&s;tened to
him in a gloomy &s;ilence, till Mr. Price relating to
him that pa&s;&s;age wherein Dolly had &s;aid, that &s;he was
<HI>a&s;&s;ured by Sir Edward Audley, that Falkland loved
her;</HI> he cried out, The villain! the arch-fiend!
it was he then was the builder of this va&s;t fabric of
iniquity, who&s;e weight now cru&s;hes all beneath it!
Mr. Price then told him of the letter which Mi&s;s Ar|nold
had &s;hewn us, and by which &s;he was betrayed
into that viper's hands. 'Tis true, &s;aid Falkland,
'tis all true; I have not an extenuation to offer which
a hair would not outweigh in the balance. Mr. Price
hinted, that as he thought his pre&s;ence mu&s;t be very
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in a hou&s;e wherein he had cau&s;ed &s;o much
affliction, he would advi&s;e him to retire to his college,
till the time of his departure arrived.</P>
<P>I mean, &s;aid Falkland, to quit this hou&s;e imme|diately;
I would not pre&s;ent &s;uch a mon&s;ter even to
the eyes of the menial &s;ervants: but what does Ce|cilia
<PB N="131" REF="306">
&s;ay to this event? She bears it, &s;aid Mr. Price,
with a firmne&s;s that does honour to her &s;ex. That's
&s;ome con&s;olation, an&s;wered Falkland:&mdash;And Mrs.
Arnold? He faltered in pronouncing my name&punc; Mrs.
Arnold, an&s;wered his preceptor, has been long in|ured
to &s;orrows; yet this &s;eems to pre&s;s hard on
her. Falkland bur&s;t into tears, and breaking abrupt|ly
from Mr. Price, ran out of the room; he heard
him call his man in the hall, to whom he gave orders
to &s;addle his hor&s;es; then &s;tepping to his own cham|ber,
he changed his cloaths, and in a few minutes af|ter,
attended by his &s;ervant, rode away from the hou&s;e
without attempting to &s;ee or &s;peak to any one in the
family. To what place the mo&s;t unfortunate ill-fated
wretch will retire to hide his &s;hame, Heaven knows!</P>
<P>What a wedding-day has this been for poor Cecilia!
My dear, the &s;trength of mind of that young creature
amazes me, and exceedingly lowers the opinion I had
of my own con&s;tancy and re&s;olution. For was not
this a trial, equal, if not &s;uperior to many of tho&s;e
with which my youth was vi&s;ited? yet with what a
becoming, what a charming fortitude does &s;he &s;upport
it! She complains not of her own fate; but wholly
attaching her&s;elf to the care of her poor &s;i&s;ter, &s;he
&s;eems even more &s;ollicitous than any of us to calm
and divert her troubled mind.</P>
<P>Dolly appears rather more compo&s;ed than &s;he has
been; yet whenever &s;he recurs (as &s;he often does in
&s;pight of our efforts to prevent it) to the fatal &s;ubject
of all our griefs, &s;he &s;hews too plainly that her rea|&s;on
is far from having re-a&s;&s;umed its &s;eat. What a
painful con&s;traint have I put upon my&s;elf &s;ince mor|ning!
I have not &s;hed a tear; yet I think there is &s;uf|ficient
cau&s;e for tears; but the burden is too great to
be relieved by &s;uch &s;light &s;uccours; and nature re|fu&s;es
to offer a re&s;ource &s;o trivial and inadequate to
the evil.</P>

<DATELINE>Bag&s;hot, <DATE>March 24th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Think my&s;elf very unfortunate in being obliged to
communicate to you a piece of very afflicting news;
but as it is impo&s;&s;ible it could be kept long a &s;ecret
from you, I thought it my duty to advi&s;e you of it the
fir&s;t. Your poor brother and my worthy friend, Sir
Edward, was killed this morning in a duel, which
he fought with Mr. Falkland, a gentleman whom I
<PB N="133" REF="308">
&s;uppo&s;e you know. I was ignorant of the whole af|fair
till it was too late to prevent it.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland came to my hou&s;e about eight o'clock
this morning; I was;in bed, and knew not of his ar|rival.
He had half an hour's conver&s;ation in private
with your brother; after which they both went into
the garden together, and from thence by a back door
into a retired part of the heath. Sir Edward's man,
who it &s;eems had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the bu&s;ine&s;s, on
&s;eeing them go out, ran to my chamber, and alarming
me with the danger, begged I would follow them, as
he &s;aid he dur&s;t not.</P>
<P>I did &s;o immediately, having only thrown on my
night-gown and &s;lippers. Ju&s;t as I came within fight
of them, Sir Edward di&s;charged his pi&s;tol and wound|ed
Mr. Falkland in the arm; but before I could reach
them, Falkland fired his, and I &s;aw Sir Edward drop
I ran up to him, and found the ball had pa&s;&s;ed through
his throat$clo&s;e by the windpipe. He was not dead;
but &s;aid, Bendi&s;h, you have, ju&s;t overtaken me;
Falkland has killed me fairly, you may tell my friends
&s;o; and let my mother and &s;i&s;ter know that I am
married. If any female &s;hould come to claim my
name after my death, let her take it; for it is all I have
to leave her. He &s;eemed to &s;peak in great agony,
holding his hand over the wound. He attempted to
&s;ay &s;omething el&s;e; but his words were inarticulate,
and he died in about two hours after he was carried
into the hou&s;e. I am mo&s;t heartily &s;orry for his death,
for he was as hone&s;t a fellow as ever lived; but we
mu&s;t all die.</P>
<P>Falkland is now confined in my hou&s;e, and under
the care of a &s;urgeon, who &s;ays his wound is a very
bad one. I find their quarrel was about a young lady
that poor Audley had ran away with, and who, it
&s;eems, is now out of her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>Any commands that you or my lady Audley &s;hall

<P>I Suppo&s;e you may by this time have heard of the
tragic event, which is likely to detain me for &s;ome
time in a kingdom, to which as &s;oon as it is in my
power I &s;hall bid an eternal adieu. But before I
bani&s;h my&s;elf for ever from your &s;ight, (Oh, that I
could as ea&s;ily bani&s;h the memory of my crimes!)
&s;uffer me, mo&s;t revered of men, &s;uffer me with that
humility with which &s;uch a wretch as I am, &s;hould
approach a &s;anctity like your's, to pour out before
you the effu&s;ions of a heart pierced with the deepe&s;t
&s;en&s;e of its own guilt.</P>
<P>Do not think that my penitence proceeds from the
languors of a &s;ick bed; the dreaded vengeance of an
injured family; or the keen di&s;appointment of all
my hopes in life. No, my venerable friend, (let me
for this <HI>once</HI> call you &s;o) degraded as I am by vice

&s;o mean, &s;o ba&s;e as the&s;e. My &s;oul &s;till retains un|extingui&s;hed

for my own fatal perver&s;ene&s;s, might have lit me to

<P>The torture of a painful and dangerous wound has
never been able to force a groan from me; the im|pending

<P>I would not extenuate by a &s;ingle grain the weight
of my offence. That &s;uits not with a repentance
&s;o &s;incere as I hope mine is: yet I cannot help ob|&s;erving,
that as the unfortunate man, who&s;e life I
have to an&s;wer for, was the primary cau&s;e of my de|parture
from right; and led me as it were &s;tep by &s;tep
to the gulph in which I am now &s;wallowed up, 'twas
ju&s;t that Heaven &s;hould in its in&s;trument of puni&s;h|ment

had perverted.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;e &s;tanding my trial for the death of Sir Ed|ward

would have an&s;wered it her&s;elf but for an indi&s;po|&s;ition,
which, though but a &s;light one, makes writing

you had de&s;ired to hear from us, delay acknow|ledging
your favour.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="311">
The&s;e are my mama's own words, which &s;he
charged me to make u&s;e of; but oh, my dear Mrs.
B&mdash;, we are all dying with apprehen&s;ions! her di&s;|order,
I am afraid, is wor&s;e, much wor&s;e than &s;he
will own it to be. There has been a vi&s;ible change
in her from day to day, &s;ince that dreadful one of
which &s;he gave you an account in her la&s;t letter.
She has entirely lo&s;t her re&s;t and her appetite. A
&s;low fever &s;eems to con&s;ume her, attended with a
con&s;tant thir&s;t; yet &s;he retains not a minute in her
&s;tomach the lighte&s;t liquids which &s;he takes. She
endeavours as much as po&s;&s;ible to hide from us
every &s;ympton of her illne&s;s. Doctor Key attends
her, and flatters us with the hope of her &s;oon getting
the better of it; yet I cannot rid my&s;elf of my fears.
God pre&s;erve her dear and mo&s;t precious life! If &s;he
&s;hould be taken from us, think, ah think, my good
Mrs. B&mdash;, what would be the condition, of two poor
de&s;olate creatures like my &s;i&s;ter and me! The cau&s;e
too! &s;o mournful! 'tis, not to be thought of without
almo&s;t dying of grief.</P>
<P>We have had a letter from my uncle Bidulph, in
which he writes word that it was reported, Sir Ed|ward
Audley had been killed in a duel, and his an|tagoni&s;t
wounded. I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard the
account, and therefore I need not name to you his
antagoni&s;t. Sir George &s;ays he knows not particu|lars,
nor is certain even of the fact; but I believe
he threw this in only to &s;often the &s;hock which he
knew this account mu&s;t give us; and he adds, <HI>if the
news be true, 'twere pity the two a&s;&s;ociate fiends</HI>
(the&s;e were his terrible words) <HI>did not peri&s;h by each
other's hand!</HI></P>
<P>My poor mama was exceedingly &s;hocked at this
account, for it appears but too probable. Mrs. Spill|marn
cried the whole day, though I think Sir Edward
Audley ill de&s;erves to be regretted by her.</P>
<P>We mentioned not the &s;tory to my &s;i&s;ter; we are
afraid of aggravating her malady, by any thing that
would alarm her tender &s;pirits. She appears pretty
tranquil, yet we are in hourly fears of a relap&s;e, for

<P>Mrs. Arnold is dangerou&s;ly ill; her fortitude is at

<HEAD>LETTER LXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Mrs. ASKHAM to Mrs. CECILIA B&mdash;
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>April 7th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am de&s;ired by the mournful family to acquaint
you with a piece of news the mo&s;t afflicting that
ever you received. I hope you have been prepared
for it, and that the black &s;eal on this letter will make
you gue&s;s at its &s;orrowful contents.</P>
<P>Oh, madam,&mdash;my mi&s;tre&s;s! my benefactre&s;s!
my friend! for &s;uch &s;he <HI>was!</HI>&mdash;but <HI>&s;he</HI> is happy,
and it is the poor &s;urvivors who are to be pitied.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cecilia writ you word how fa&s;t her mama's
health was declining. We all &s;aw it, yet the admira|ble
lady her&s;elf &s;truggled again&s;t her di&s;order as long
as &s;he was able; but la&s;t Tue&s;day, finding her&s;elf much
<PB N="139" REF="314">
wor&s;e than ordinary, &s;he was obliged to be put again
to bed after &s;he had ri&s;en and dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was with her, as I con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ed every day&punc; at
the hou&s;e &s;ince Mi&s;s Arnold's return. Mrs. A&s;kham,
&s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, and taking me by the hand, as I
&s;at at her bed-&s;ide, I'll tell you a &s;ecret; then lower|ing
her voice (for her waiting-maid was in the room)
I am going very fa&s;t, &s;aid &s;he; this la&s;t, blow has
&s;truck home and effectually done its work. I was
obliged to whip out my handkerchief, and could
only an&s;wer, God forbid, madam! Do you then
begrudge me my repo&s;e, my dear Party? &s;aid &s;he;
I thought you would have congratulated me.&mdash;
Do not &s;ay any thing to the poor children, added
&s;he; they will have time enough to lament me when
all is over. There are two points which I would
wi&s;h to accompli&s;h before I die. One of them I
&s;hall not mention to you at pre&s;ent; the other is to
&s;ee and be reconciled to Falkland; for indeed, Patty,
Falkland is as much the author of my death, as if he
had di&s;patched me with a pi&s;tol ball, as he has done
Sir Edward Audley. Poor forlorn wretch! I <HI>know</HI>
he will accu&s;e him&s;elf of it when I &s;hall not have it
in my power to grant him pardon; 'tis, for this rea|&s;on
I would willingly accord it to him now, as the
la&s;t gift I have to bequeath him, for I have already
taken care of his fortune. You have &s;een, continued
&s;he, the letter he has written to Mr. Price. I <HI>think</HI>
his repentance is &s;incere; and in that belief, I would
not wi&s;h to leave the world without affording him the
&s;ingle con&s;olation he can now receive, that of know|ing
from my own mouth that I forgive him.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired me to call Mr. Price to her, which
I did; and after having given him her rea&s;on for de|&s;iring
it, &s;he begged he would write a few lines to
Mr. Falkland reque&s;ting his pre&s;ence at Woodberry
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The poor lady complained of a pain in her che&s;t,
and a dizzine&s;s in her head. I entreated her to &s;uffer
another phy&s;ician to be called in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Doctor Key. My good friend, &s;aid &s;he, if I thought
<PB N="140" REF="315">
I could be relieved by human means, I &s;hould think
my&s;elf bound to follow your advice; but, indeed,
my dear, my ca&s;e is out of the reach of medicine, and
though I permit a phy&s;ician to attend me for form
&s;ake, I <HI>feel</HI> that it is all over with me. Believe me,
Patty, 'tis what I have longed for; and if I had not
thought it a crime, 'tis that for which I &s;hould mo&s;t
earne&s;tly have prayed,</P>
<P>She de&s;ired that Mi&s;s Arnold might be let to &s;tay
with her as little as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t it &s;hould affect her
&s;pirits too much; but Mi&s;s Cecilia was almo&s;t con|&s;tantly
at her bed-&s;ide. The &s;weet young lady, what
a di&s;mal time &s;he has had for this fortnight pa&s;t! but
&s;he takes after her excellent mother in courage, as
well as in every other per&s;ection. Mr. Price, Mrs.
Spillman, and my&s;elf did all we could to entertain
Mi&s;s Arnold, and divert her from going into her
mama's room. We had a hard ta&s;k to prevent, her,
&s;he <HI>would</HI> attend her mama, was &s;he not as capable
as Cecilia? True, my dear mi&s;s, but the doctor has
ordered your mama to be kept extremely quiet; &s;he
is forbid to &s;peak, and one per&s;on is &s;ufficient to be
with her at a time. And why cannot <HI>I</HI> be that one
per&s;on? for I would &s;it by her all day without open|ing
my lips. Ah, Mrs. A&s;kham, I &s;ee I am not tho|roughly
forgiven&mdash;We were obliged now and then
to let her go into her chamber. She would enter
&s;oftly, peep in at the bed's feet, and after looking
for about a minute &s;orrowfully at her mama, retire
again without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed over in this manner. Mrs. Arnold
could not be prevailed on to touch any thing but
a little weak chicken broth; &s;he &s;aid &s;he had a loath|ing
at the thoughts of eating; indeed, her &s;tomach
had not been able to bear any thing &s;olid for &s;everal
days before; I would fain have pa&s;&s;ed the night by
her, but &s;he would not &s;uffer me: You need, not fear
my <HI>e&s;caping</HI> to-night, &s;aid &s;he; I &s;hall not accompli&s;h
my journey &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>When I attended her next morning, I found her,
as I thought, much better. She told me the pain
<PB N="141" REF="316">
in her che&s;t was entirely gone, the giddine&s;s, which
&s;he had complained of the day before, was greatly
dimini&s;hed, and that &s;he felt nothing but an univer&s;al
feeblene&s;s, which, without being painful, had re|duced
her to a &s;tate weaker than that of new-born
infancy.</P>
<P>Never was any thing &s;o calm, &s;o tranquil as &s;he
continued the whole day. Mr. Price came in to &s;it
with her. I have been thinking this morning, &s;aid
&s;he, of a circum&s;tance, about which (though I look
upon it as too trivial to mention in my will) I &s;hould
neverthele&s;s chu&s;e to leave a memorandum. What
is it, my good madam? &s;aid Mr. Price. It was al|ways
my wi&s;h, replied &s;he, to live with as much pri|vacy
as po&s;&s;ible, and to go out of the world with as
little pomp as I came into it; and for this rea&s;on, it
has ever been my intention to be laid, without any
noi&s;e, and as little ceremony as may be, in the church
of whatever pari&s;h I &s;hould happen to die in. I
therefore ju&s;t mention this to you, Mr. Price, as I
think you the propere&s;t per&s;on to receive &s;uch an in|junction.
I hope, &s;aid the good gentleman, the ful|filling
this injunction is a duty which will never be
paid by me. My dear &s;ir, replied Mrs. Arnold, do
you &s;ay that by way of encouraging me with the
hopes of <HI>life?</HI> Ah, I thought you knew me better;
and that I had at lea&s;t the credit with you of not
being &s;uppo&s;ed afraid to die. That I am &s;ure you
are not, madam; you are a good woman; your life
has been uniformly pious; and I think, as far as
humanity will admit of the eulogium, you are <HI>blame|le&s;s.</HI>
I would not be guilty of arrogance, an&s;wer|ed
Mrs. Arnold; yet I have the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atis|faction
to declare, that, upon taking a &s;urvey of my
pa&s;t life, I do not recollect ever to have been <HI>wil|fully</HI>
guilty of an action contrary to the duty I owe
my Maker. Mr. Price lifted up his hands and eyes,
as if in thankfulne&s;s to Heaven. I know, pur&s;ued
Mrs. Arnold, it is more cu&s;tomary, and perhaps
more becoming too, even for good people, when
they find their end is drawing near, to accu&s;e them|&s;elves
<PB N="142" REF="317">
as very &s;inful per&s;ons: but how ea&s;y is it to
put on the robe of humiliation, and to a&s;&s;ume the
look and tone of penitence! whil&s;t, perhaps, their
heart does not, <HI>can</HI> not feel compunction for tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es,
which in their health and &s;trength they thought
too trivial for atonement, and which now, without
making any real impre&s;&s;ion on them, they acknow|ledge
more from &s;uppo&s;ition than recollection. Let
tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences are really oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;eek
for con&s;olation in an humble confe&s;&s;ion of their faults:
but if the &s;oul, retiring to &s;earch into her&s;elf, finds
in tho&s;e &s;olemn hours, when nothing within can di|vert
her from the awful &s;crutiny, nor from without
can &s;educe her to pervert the truth, if then &s;he finds
that &s;he is &s;elf-acquitted, let her boldly &s;tand up, and,
like righteous Samuel, declare her own innocence;
not pre&s;umptuou&s;ly to vaunt a &s;uperior virtue, but
to give our repining friends, who perhaps may too
tenderly lament us, the greate&s;t and be&s;t founded
con&s;olation they can receive: and this, my good
&s;ir, is my only rea&s;on for telling you I am not afraid
to die. I know it, madam, an&s;wered Mr. Price;
and am as well convinced of your rea&s;ons as I am
of the fact it&s;elf: yet you are &s;till in the prime of life,
and it is natural for your friends to wi&s;h that you
&s;hould&mdash;What, my dear &s;ir? drag on a few more
mi&s;erable years? and have, in all likelihood, the in|firmities
of age &s;uperadded to my misfortunes! No,
no, my worthy friend, they love me not wi&s;ely who
would wi&s;h to &s;ee my days prolonged. This is a fit
&s;ea&s;on for my departure, when I look upon the &s;um|mons
to <HI>quit</HI> life as a greater ble&s;&s;ing than any which
could now be be&s;towed upon me in it. You know
I have &s;uffered a variety of &s;orrows; and though I
may have (when my impatience got the better of my
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) in &s;ome unguarded minute wi&s;hed for a
relea&s;e, yet &s;till, in my calmer hours, I found &s;ome
call that drew me back to life; &s;ome tie, that I could
not &s;ee without regret about to be di&s;&s;olved; and I
found, upon reflection, that I &s;hould have died but
half re&s;igned. But my fate <HI>now</HI> &s;eems to be con&s;um|mated.
<PB N="143" REF="318">
Di&s;appointed in my <HI>la&s;t</HI> hopes, what is there
to attach me to this world? Let me quit it then,
whil&s;t my longings after another are alive and warm;
whil&s;t the recent &s;mart of my &s;ufferings makes me
con&s;ider my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion as the tendere&s;t mercy that
my creator (without rever&s;ing his own decrees) could
vouch&s;afe me. This is the u&s;e, my good Mr. Price,
that I would fain make of my afflictions; 'tis the u&s;e
I would have my friends make of them; and in&s;tead
of murmuring that my years were &s;o &s;oon cut off, to
return thanks to God that he did not lengthen them.</P>
<P>I have been enabled, madam, to give you the con|ver&s;ation
of this ble&s;&s;ed lady by Mr. Price's means,
who having, after he had left her chamber, writ down
every word &s;he had &s;aid to him, &s;uffered me to take a
copy of it.</P>
<P>She continued the remainder of that and all the
next day without any vi&s;ible alteration. We would
fain have flattered our&s;elves with hope; but we dared
not even to hint it to Mrs. Arnold: <HI>Her</HI> hope and
ours, Mr. Price &s;aid, had different centers.</P>
<P>She retained her u&s;ual &s;weet compo&s;ure; and with|out
affecting to be chearful, &s;hewed not the lea&s;t ap|pearance
of gloomine&s;s or impatience. What a hap|pine&s;s
is it, &s;aid &s;he, thus to glide &s;o &s;moothly from
one &s;hore to another! I feel neither pain nor &s;ickne&s;s;
and if it were not for certain &s;en&s;ations I have within,
and which I cannot de&s;cribe, joined to a feeblene&s;s
which increa&s;es hourly, I &s;hould almo&s;t doubt whe|ther
my deliverance were &s;o near at hand: yet I am
&s;ure my ta&s;k will be accompli&s;hed in a day or two.
Whenever the event happens, I would have Mrs. B&mdash;
apprized of it tenderly. I have already de&s;ired Cecilia
to prepare her for it by a &s;econd letter; for when
&s;he writ the fir&s;t I knew not how long the combat
might have la&s;ted.</P>
<P>She mentioned Mr. Falkland &s;everal times; expre&s;|&s;ing
&s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s le&s;t he &s;hould not come, or,
what would be wor&s;e, &s;hould not arrive time enough.
For it is for his own &s;ake chiefly, &s;aid &s;he, I wi&s;h to
&s;ee him.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="319">
Mr. Falkland, however, did arrive on Friday night.
He was obliged to be brought in a litter: he had had
a violent fever. His wound, it &s;eems, was &s;o dange|rous
a one, that the &s;urgeons were for &s;ome time in
doubt whether they mu&s;t not have been forced to
take off his arm. He was reduced extremely low,
and could not bear the motion of any other convey|ance
than that by which he was carried.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arnold was told he was come. I am glad of
it, &s;aid &s;he; for I think to-morrow it would have
been too late. The two Mi&s;s Arnolds happened both
to be in the room, when notice was given that Mr.
Falkland was below &s;tairs. Their mama had before
told them that &s;he expected him; and now a&s;ked
them, if they cho&s;e to &s;ee him, or would rather re|tire?
They begged their mama's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay.
She reque&s;ted Mr. Price to go and conduct Mr. Falk|land
up &s;tairs, in order, I &s;uppo&s;e, to give him an
opportunity of preparing the unfortunate young man
for &s;uch an interview; for probably he did not ex|pect
to &s;ee either of the young ladies.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold withdrew into a corner of the room,
which being darkened by a &s;creen, it was not ea&s;y
to di&s;tingui&s;h her. She &s;at down, covering her face
with her white handkerchief. Mi&s;s Cecilia kept her
place by her mama's bed-&s;ide; but I could perceive
her colour came and went.&mdash;We all waited in &s;ilent
expectation. I thought the time appeared long be|fore
Mr. Falkland came up &s;tairs; yet I dreaded to
&s;ee him: and when I heard the chamber door open,
I felt as if my fle&s;h as it were crept. Mr. Price en|tered
fir&s;t, Mr. Falkland followed him with a &s;low
pace; his left arm was &s;lung in a black &s;carf, and he
looked like one ri&s;en from his grave. Mi&s;s Cecilia
ro&s;e up, making him a kind of &s;alute, but did not
&s;peak. She was the fir&s;t object that &s;truck his eyes
on entering the room; but he turned them quickly
from her, as if the &s;ight of her were in&s;upportable to
him. Oh, madam, had you &s;een him, you would, in
&s;pight of his faults, have pitied the unhappy youth!
His countenance &s;o aba&s;hed! &s;o mortified! &s;o afflicted!
<PB N="145" REF="320">
He approached Mrs. Arnold's bed-&s;ide with trembling
&s;teps, where, throwing him&s;elf on his knees, he hid
his face on the coverlet, and bur&s;t into tears. The
poor lady her&s;elf &s;eemed extremely moved. She laid
one of her hands on his head, and was for &s;ome time
without being able to utter a word. Mi&s;s Cecilia
could not con&s;train her&s;elf any longer, &s;he wept bit|terly;
and poor Mi&s;s Arnold, who from her corner
had ob&s;erved what was pa&s;&s;ing, &s;obbed &s;o loud, that
I was afraid &s;he would have been &s;uffocated, and ran
to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She put me from her gently; then
ri&s;ing up, &s;he &s;tepped &s;oftly behind the curtain of her
mama's bed, and bending down, with her arms half
&s;tretched out, hung over Mr. Falkland, as if &s;he were
inclined, but afraid to rai&s;e him up. His tears were
&s;till gu&s;hing abundantly Mrs. Arnold at length
broke her affecting &s;ilence; but the tone of her voice
had &s;omething &s;till more touching in it. It was in|terrupted
and unequal; it was the voice of tender|ne&s;s
mixed with grief. I did not &s;end for you, Or|lando,
to di&s;tre&s;s you thus&mdash;I believe you are &s;orry
for the misfortunes that you have brought upon my
family&mdash;I forgive you from my &s;oul&mdash;This is not a
time for reproaches; I would willingly comfort you,
if I could.&mdash;Which <HI>way,</HI> madam? &s;aid Falkland,
lifting up his head; do you think with &s;uch objects
as <HI>the&s;e</HI> before my eyes (looking round him) that I
can be comforted? Oh! no, no, though I have lo&s;t
my virtue, I have not lo&s;t my feelings.&mdash;You mu&s;t
deprive me of memory, of rea&s;on, of humanity, be|fore
you talk of comfort! It becomes you, &s;aid Mrs.
Arnold, to have a ju&s;t &s;orrow for your mi&s;conduct;
but do not let a too lively &s;en&s;e of it tran&s;port you
into wild exce&s;&s;es. I would fain attribute your fault
to youth, to pa&s;&s;ion; but above all, to wicked coun|&s;el
and example. Do not, therefore, look upon your|&s;elf
as abandoned to evil; but endeavour rather, in
your future conduct, to make what atonement you
can for the pa&s;t. I &s;peak this only with regard to
what concerns your own welfare; for as to me and
the&s;e two children, you have no reparation in your
<PB N="146" REF="321">
power&mdash;The evil is pa&s;t remedy; and the only con|&s;olation
that I have to offer you, is to tell you that
you are <HI>forgiven.</HI> It was for this purpo&s;e only that
I de&s;ired to &s;ee you, as I thought it might a little
lighten the burden of a wounded con&s;cience. I do
therefore again repeat it to you, that I quit life with
the &s;ame &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion and maternal love
for you that I felt when your helple&s;s infancy was
by your dear father fir&s;t committed to my charge.&mdash;
I think, added &s;he, after pau&s;ing, as if to recover from
the emotion which this la&s;t recollection had occa|&s;ioned,
I think I can venture to promi&s;e that my two
daughters grant you as free a pardon as I do. What
&s;ay you, my children?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cecilia was the fir&s;t to reply; and &s;tepping up
to the bed-&s;ide, <HI>I,</HI> madam, am lea&s;t injured of all,
&s;aid &s;he; yet were his offences again&s;t me even greater
than they are, <HI>your</HI> example would teach me to blot
them all from my mind; therefore, from hencefor|ward,
Falkland, you may again look upon me as your
&s;i&s;ter; but for any other tie, though you were to|morrow
at liberty, and all my friends con&s;enting to the
union, I &s;hould for ever renounce it. Nor &s;hould I
dare to think of it, replied Mr. Falkland. And you,
my dear, &s;aid the excellent woman to Mi&s;s Arnold,
do not you forgive this poor youth? Ah, mama, I
have no re&s;entment again&s;t him&mdash;I never had&mdash;'Tis
<HI>I</HI> who &s;hould demand forgivene&s;s of him; if it had
not been for me he might have been happy, &s;o might
poor Cecilia, &s;o might you: but I have broke all your
hearts! Yet indeed, Orlando, I did not mean to di|vide
you from your love&mdash;I had made a re&s;olution to
die in &s;ilence&mdash;I know not what tempted me to break
it, unle&s;s it be (which I &s;u&s;pect to be the truth) that I
was that day &s;eized with a &s;trange di&s;traction. For|give
me, &s;ir, pray forgive me! And &s;he held up both
her hands, fixing her &s;weet eyes with a &s;upplicating
look on Mr. Falkland's face. Oh, God! cried he,
wringing his hands, 'tis ju&s;t that my puni&s;hment &s;hould
be proportioned to my crimes! yet I cannot bear
this! He turned from her in an agony of grief. She
<PB N="147" REF="322">
followed him&mdash;He will not &s;peak to me, mama! I
do not wonder he &s;hould be angry, yet I wi&s;h he
would not hate me! Speak to her, &s;aid Mrs. Arnold,
her voice broken with &s;obs&mdash;Indulge her; you &s;ee
how it is with her. Mr. Falkland threw him&s;elf at
her feet; No, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Arnold, &s;aid he, Falkland
is not altogether &s;uch a mon&s;trous prodigy as to hate
you! He e&s;teems, he re&s;pects, he reveres you more
than ever; and if he &s;huns your &s;ight, 'tis &s;hame, and
not re&s;entment, that bids him hide his face. Mi&s;s
Arnold ju&s;t lightly pre&s;&s;ed with her fingers one of his
hands. I am &s;atisfied then, &s;aid &s;he; and, with a
plea&s;ed look, quitted him, and retired again behind
the curtain.</P>
<P>We were all deeply moved at this &s;cene. You
may judge, madam, how the poor dying lady was
affected. I drew near to the bed-&s;ide. Her &s;pirits
&s;eemed quite exhau&s;ted, and her face was in a cold
&s;weat. I begged of her to take &s;omething to refre&s;h
her; and &s;he &s;uffered me to give her a little wine and
water with a few drops in it.</P>
<P>I have now, &s;aid &s;he, accompli&s;hed one half of my
work; if I can complete the other, I &s;hall die in
peace. Cecilia, my dear, come hither. The young
lady approached her; and Mrs. Arnold drew from
under her pillow a letter. I received this &s;ome time
ago, &s;aid &s;he, from my lord V&mdash;. Let Mr. Price
read it aloud, that you may all hear the contents of
it. Mr. Price did &s;o; and here inclo&s;ed, madam, I
&s;end you a copy of it.</P>
<P>I did not chu&s;e, &s;aid Mrs. Arnold to Mi&s;s Cecilia,
to communicate this letter to you, till I knew how
your heart &s;tood affected to Falkland. I therefore
only told my lord V&mdash;, in an&s;wer to what he had
written, that I &s;hould take a time to recal the &s;ubject
to you. This is the time, Cecilia, that I have cho&s;en.
I have ju&s;t now heard you declare that you renounced
all union with Falkland. He is here pre&s;ent; here
is your &s;i&s;ter; and here our two worthy friends.
Will you, my dear Cecilia, will you give your dying
mother the con&s;olation to think that &s;he leaves her
<PB N="148" REF="323">
child under the protection of that worthy lord? If
your heart is &s;till repugnant to him, I do not mean
by a <HI>la&s;t</HI> reque&s;t to con&s;train it; but if you think
you can be happy with lord V&mdash;, &s;ay you will
be his wife. Mi&s;s Cecilia kneeled down, and taking
one of her mama's hands, which &s;he tenderly ki&s;&s;ed,
wetting it with her tears, Yes, my beloved mama,
I make you the promi&s;e you require, in pre&s;ence of
all the&s;e witne&s;&s;es. I re&s;pect my lord V&mdash;, I honour
him above all men; and if he is &s;till willing to offer
me his hand, I will receive it with gratitude. I
thank you, my love, &s;aid Mrs. Arnold; my work is
now fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired her will might be brought to her,
&s;aying &s;he had a few words to add. She directed me
to a drawer in a little cabinet by her bed-&s;ide, where
I found it folded up. I gave it to her, together with
a pen and ink; and having rai&s;ed her up in bed with
her pillows at her back, &s;he wrote a few lines. Then
folding up the paper again, &s;he put it into Mr. Price's
hands, with the&s;e words, let my brother Bidulph
know that this was the la&s;t action of my life; and tell
him&mdash;She &s;topped &s;hort, as if interrupted by &s;ome
&s;udden and extraordinary emotion; a fine colour
flu&s;hed at once into her face, and her eyes, which
were before funk and langui&s;hing, &s;eemed in an
in&s;tant to have recovered all their fire. I never &s;aw
&s;o animated a figure! She &s;prung forward with energy,
her arms extended, her eyes lifted up with rapture,
and, with an elevated voice, &s;he cried out&mdash;<HI>I come!</HI>
Then &s;inking down &s;oftly on her pillow &s;he clo&s;ed
her eyes, and expired without a &s;igh.&mdash;Oh, madam,
this was not the exit of a dying woman, it was the
a&s;cen&s;ion of a ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit to heaven! We were all
&s;urrounding her bed, our looks turned as it were me|chanically
towards the place where hers had been
fixed; when turning them again towards her, The
&s;aint is at length fallen a&s;leep, &s;aid Mr. Price; and
quits life with the &s;ame dignity which accompanied
her throughout all her actions!</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="324">
I thought not at fir&s;t that &s;he was dead. Poor
Mi&s;s Arnold was in the &s;ame error; and &s;eeing her
mama lie &s;o &s;till, What a &s;weet &s;lumber this is, &s;aid
&s;he, and how &s;uddenly it has fallen upon her! My
poor mama! we have fatigued her with our di&s;cour&s;e;
but I hope this &s;leep will do her good. We mu&s;t
not di&s;turb her. Come, Cecilia, let us leave her to
her repo&s;e; Mrs. A&s;k&s;nam will be &s;o kind as to &s;tay
by her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cecilia an&s;wered her not; but throwing one
arm round her &s;i&s;ter's wai&s;t, while with the other &s;he
covered her eyes with her handkerchief, &s;he let her|&s;elf
be led out of the room; Mi&s;s Arnold, with a
&s;miling countenance looking back at her mama.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland &s;tood motionle&s;s at the bed's feet,
his eyes fixed in mute &s;orrow on the lifele&s;s cor&s;e of
her, who had been more than a mother to him; of
her who&s;e days <HI>he</HI> had &s;hortened, by a conduct of
which he now felt all the &s;hame and all the guilt.
The &s;uddenne&s;s of her departure (for a few minutes
before we &s;aw no &s;ymptoms of approaching death)
had amazed and terrified him. He beheld her &s;ome
time in &s;ilence; then bur&s;ting into a pa&s;&s;ion of grief,
little &s;hort of frenzy, he &s;mote his brea&s;t, and tearing
his fine curled hair out by the roots, And is this,
&s;aid he, the comfort I was bid to hope in coming
hither! to be a witne&s;s to the ruin and de&s;olation
that I my&s;elf have made! Look at thy handy-work,
Falkland; behold the fruit of thy horrid perfidy!
Was it not enough to drive your child to madne&s;s, to
&s;ee that accompli&s;hed mind quite overturn'd and lo&s;t?
Mu&s;t I have the aggravated crime to an&s;wer for of
making her an orphan too! Then throwing him&s;elf
down by the body of Mrs. Arnold, 'Tis mine, &s;aid
he, my accur&s;ed head that &s;hould have been laid
low, and not this of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of women!</P>
<P>Mr. Price took him by the hand, and intreating
him to ri&s;e, Have more re&s;pect, &s;aid he, for the&s;e
pious remains, and do not prophane them by u&s;e|le&s;s
and outrageous expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion. Let me
be&s;eech you, &s;ir, to withdraw with me. This cham|ber
<PB N="150" REF="325">
mu&s;t be left unmole&s;ted to Mrs. A&s;kham and the
women &s;ervants; we mu&s;t now take our leave of it.
Then by a motion, which appeared almo&s;t involuntary,
he bowed to the honoured cor&s;e; and laying hold on
Mr. Falkland's arm, drew him, not without difficulty,
out of the chamber.</P>
<P>Thus, madam, have I given you an account of
the la&s;t hours of Mrs. Arnold. I believe you know
&s;he was &s;carce eight and thirty; and &s;he &s;till retained
a large portion of that exqui&s;ite beauty, which had
been &s;o much admired in her youth. We did not let
Mi&s;s Arnold know of her death till this morning. It
has quite overwhelmed her. Words cannot expre&s;s
the &s;orrow that is &s;pread throughout the whole hou&s;e.
I &s;hall do my&s;elf the honour to write to you again in
a few days, as it cannot be expected that poor Mi&s;s
Cecilia will be in a condition to do it. Mr. Price
writes this day to inform Sir George Bidulph of our
great lo&s;s; and I take the opportunity of &s;ending
this by the &s;ervant who carries his letter. May

<P>I Have, with un&s;peakable concern, received from

<DATELINE>Woodberry, <DATE>April 12th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall begin with telling you that the two young
ladies are at pre&s;ent in as tolerable health as can
be expected, con&s;idering the cruel blow they have
ju&s;t received. They neither of them, however, &s;tir
out of their chamber; nor have they &s;een Mr.
Falkland &s;ince the night of their mama's death,
though he is &s;till in the hou&s;e; for he was &s;eized
the next day with a return of his fever, and has been
confined to his bed ever &s;ince; though I hope he is
not in any danger.</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph arrived here the day after he
received Mr. Price's letter. He was deeply affected
at entering the hou&s;e; and when he &s;aw the two
<PB N="152" REF="327">
young ladies, he wept bitterly, and with great kind|ne&s;s
endeavoured to con&s;ole them.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired to have a &s;ight of his &s;i&s;ter; and I
conducted him into her chamber, where Mrs. Spill|man,
the hou&s;e-keeper, and her own maid were
&s;itting. He fixed his eyes on her, for &s;ome time,
with great tenderne&s;s. Look, Mrs. A&s;kham, &s;aid
he, at that poor little pale piece of clay! We both
remember her once the boa&s;t and ornament of her
&s;ex. She &s;acrificed the happine&s;s of her whole life
to a too rigid duty, and at length her life it&s;elf is
&s;acrificed to ingratitude! Oh, Sidney, thou mu&s;t be
greatly recompen&s;ed, or&mdash;He &s;topped at this
word; and de&s;iring I would pre&s;erve for him a lock
of her hair, he retired, the tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>Mr. Price &s;aid he had not yet opened Mrs. Arnold's
will: as &s;he had named Sir George Bidulph one of
her executors, he told him he had waited for his
arrival. Sir George reque&s;ted it might be read. I
was pre&s;ent with the two young ladies. She has
bequeathed her real e&s;tate, which is con&s;iderable,
equally between them, and has left to Mr. Falkland
a legacy of ten thou&s;and pounds. She has left to
every one of her friends a token of remembrance;
and has not forgot any one of her &s;ervants, even
down to the lowe&s;t of them. In a little codicil,
dated four days before her death, &s;he bequeaths Mrs.
Spillman three thou&s;and pounds, charged on her
daughters e&s;tate, as &s;he had already di&s;po&s;ed of all
her per&s;onal fortune in a variety of legacies. This,
&s;he &s;ays, &s;he leaves her as a token of her gratitude
for the eminent &s;ervice &s;he rendered Mi&s;s Arnold.</P>
<P>Mr. Price having read through the whole will,
which was duly executed, came to tho&s;e lines which
the admirable lady had written a few minutes before
her death. Here is &s;omething added, &s;aid he to Sir
George, which Mrs. Arnold de&s;ired me to tell you
was the la&s;t act of her life; and &s;o indeed it was.
The&s;e, madam, were her words.</P>
<P>&startq;My daughter Celicia has given me her promi&s;e
to become the wife of lord V&mdash;. 'Tis therefore
<PB N="153" REF="328">
my de&s;ire, that &s;he give her hand to that worthy
nobleman, as &s;oon after my decea&s;e as decency will
permit; and that &s;he take her &s;i&s;ter Arnold home
to her own hou&s;e, there to remain under her tender
care, till it &s;hall plea&s;e Almighty God to re&s;tore her
(of which I am not without hope) to the perfect
u&s;e of her rea&s;on, and thereby enable her to
conduct her&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir George Bidulph li&s;tened with plea&s;ure to this
article, looking affectionately at Mi&s;s Cecilia, who,
together with her &s;i&s;ter, was drowned in tears from
the moment Mr. Price had begun to read. You
have then con&s;ented, niece, &s;aid he, to marry my
lord V&mdash;? I have, &s;ir, replied the young lady.
That's well! an&s;wered Sir George; <HI>one</HI> of you, at
lea&s;t will be happy. He &s;poke not to Mi&s;s Arnold,
but turned the conver&s;ation to &s;ome other &s;ubject.
Mr. Price told me afterwards, that upon Sir George's
being informed that Mr. Falkland was in the hou&s;e,
and very ill, he replied, &startq;What a mercy it would
be to us all if he were to die! I cannot bear the
thoughts of him, and hope we may never meet.&endq;</P>
<P>When Mr. Price acquainted Mr. Falkland with
what Mrs. Arnold had done for him in her will, it
drew from him the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations of
his own unworthine&s;s, mixed with the tendere&s;t
acknowledgments of gratitude for her memory. He
purpo&s;es retiring from hence as &s;oon as he is able to
go abroad, and to remain concealed at &s;ome friend's
hou&s;e, till he is ready to depart from England.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Arnold had de&s;ired to be buried privately
in her pari&s;h church, &s;he is to be interred to-night
agreeably to her reque&s;t. Sir George Bidulph intends
returning to town to-morrow. The two young
ladies continue here, neither of them choo&s;ing to
accompany him to London; neither indeed does Sir
George de&s;ire it, as it is expected the marriage of
Mi&s;s Cecilia with my lord V&mdash;will very &s;oon take
place.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, madam, things are in a more fa|vourable
<PB N="154" REF="329">
train than could be rea&s;onably hoped after
&s;o many di&s;a&s;trous events. I am, madam, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t letter which appears in this col|lection.
The remainder of Mrs. Arnold's hi&s;tory, or
rather that of her daughters, is drawn up by Mrs.
A&s;kham her&s;elf; but as her &s;tyle is &s;omewhat diffu&s;e,
and the narrative contains many minute and &s;ome
immaterial circum&s;tances, I &s;hall endeavour to com|pre&s;s
it in as narrow a compa&s;s as I can; giving the
readers only &s;uch events as they may naturally be
&s;uppo&s;ed curious to know. I have taken the like
liberty with &s;ome of Mrs. A&s;kham's letters, for which
I hope her daughter will pardon me; as, without
altering the &s;en&s;e, I have only here and there changed
the phra&s;e.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CONCLUSION of Mrs. ARNOLD's HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Falkland withdrew from Woodberry a few
days after the interment of Mrs. Arnold, and
retired to the hou&s;e of a gentleman a few miles from
Oxford. The two Mi&s;s Arnolds reque&s;ted of Mrs.
A&s;kham not to leave them in their pre&s;ent melancho|ly
&s;ituation; and they invited Mrs. Spillman to &s;tay
with them till her affairs were &s;ettled. Nothing
could be more amiable than the behaviour of Mi&s;s
Cecilia to her &s;i&s;ter; her whole time was employed
in &s;oothing and con&s;oling her. She mentioned not
Mr. Falkland's name; or, if &s;he did, it was but to
return thanks to Heaven who had pre&s;erved her
from the misfortune of being his wife. She &s;poke of
lord V&mdash;with the highe&s;t veneration, and of her
intended marriage with him as of an event which
would make her happy. This was the only topic
from whence poor mi&s;s Arnold &s;eemed to draw any
con&s;olation, for her tears perpetually flowed for the
lo&s;s of her excellent mother.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="330">
Lord V&mdash;writ a letter of condolance to mi&s;s
Cecilia immediately after Sir George Bidulph's return
to town. He touched with great delicacy, yet with
the warme&s;t acknowledgments, on the conce&s;&s;ion &s;he
had made in his favour, and hinted his intention of
attending her at Woodberry as &s;oon as her grief
would permit her to receive his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;ituation, when the two young
ladies were &s;urprized one day by a very unexpected
gue&s;t. It was mi&s;s Audley, who, having come
down to Oxford on &s;ome family affairs which her
brother's death made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle, took this
opportunity of paying them a vi&s;it. She was in deep
mourning, and her looks well corre&s;ponded with her
habit. The two mi&s;s Arnolds melted at the &s;ight of
a companion whom they had known in their happier
days. Mi&s;s Audley mixed her tears with theirs, not
from &s;ympathy, for her heart was pierced with real
grief for the lo&s;s of a brother whom (however un|worthy)
&s;he had pa&s;&s;ionately loved. The &s;ight of her
two young friends revived her afflicting remembrance
of him. The melancholy appearance of a hou&s;e
wherein &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many chearful hours, ju&s;t
deprived of its admirable mi&s;tre&s;s; the recollection
of poor mi&s;s Arnold's frenzy; of Falkland's de&s;pair
(of which Mr. Bendi&s;h had given her an account);
all the&s;e mournful ideas pre&s;enting them&s;elves to her
mind at once, joined to the inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
having her&s;elf but too fatally contributed to &s;o many
dreadful mi&s;chiefs, &s;tung her with remor&s;e, and pro|bably
for the fir&s;t time in her life, made her reflect
&s;eriou&s;ly on her own faulty conduct.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Audley's education had been ill calculated to
in&s;pire her with the principles of virtue. Her early
childhood had, in that re&s;pect, been totally neglect|ed;
having been, by the indolence of a mother,
too &s;ond of plea&s;ure, turned over to the care of an
ignorant governe&s;s of a boarding-&s;chool. Her more
advanced years, under the conduct of that &s;ame
mother, had been &s;pent in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation:
always u&s;ed to expence, and brought up with the
<PB N="156" REF="331">
expectations of a fortune, &s;he found her&s;elf now by
Sir Edward's death, who&s;e affairs were irretrievably
involved, cut off from all her flattering pro&s;pects,
and reduced to a mortifying dependence on her
mother's &s;mall jointure. She was not able to &s;u&s;tain
this change; and in proportion as &s;he had been
intoxicated by vanity, was &s;he now aba&s;ed by
de&s;pondence.</P>
<P>She told the two mi&s;s Arnolds, that &s;he was come
to take her leave of them; that her mama and &s;he not
being able to endure the living in England after the
tragic event which had &s;o lately happened in their
family, were determined to withdraw into France,
in order to pa&s;s there the remainder of their days.
She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf deeply affected at the mi&s;eries
which had been brought upon Mrs. Arnold's hou&s;e
by her brother's means; acknowledged that <HI>he</HI> had
been even more to blame than Falkland, and in the
hurry of her &s;pirits between confu&s;ion and remor&s;e,
accu&s;ed her&s;elf bitterly for the part &s;he had acted.</P>
<P>Mrs. A&s;kham, who was pre&s;ent at this conver&s;a|tion,
&s;eeing the young lady's heart &s;o open, and (as
&s;he hoped) &s;o penitent for her fault, took this op|portunity
of telling her, that &s;ince &s;he had the happi|ne&s;s
to be &s;en&s;ible of her errors, was &s;o good as to be
&s;orry for them, and &s;o generous as to acknowledge
them, that &s;he hoped &s;he would &s;till go farther; and
as the only compen&s;ation &s;he could make was to ren|der
all the ju&s;tice in her power to Mr. Falkland, it
would be very acceptable to the family to know by
what means he and mi&s;s Arnold had been led into
engagements &s;o contrary to their duty; &s;o contrary to
mi&s;s Arnold's re&s;erved and timid di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;o
contrary even to Mr. Falkland's own inclinations.
She added, that they had got but very imperfect
lights from mi&s;s Arnold, and as it was a &s;ubject they
never wi&s;hed to renew to her, and which indeed &s;he
might not be &s;o well qualified to clear up as mi&s;s
Audley her&s;elf, they &s;hould think them&s;elves obliged
to that lady if &s;he would gratify them with the
explanation they de&s;ired. Mi&s;s Audley replied, it will
<PB N="157" REF="332">
be a very &s;hameful confe&s;&s;ion for me, Mrs. A&s;kham,
and probably were I to continue here I &s;hould not
have the courage to make it; but &s;ince I am going to
leave England, <HI>never,</HI> I believe, to return to it, I
will, before my departure, give up &s;ome letters,
which, in a light however reproachful they may put
me and my brother, will at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure
ju&s;tify Falkland: and this is a duty which I think
my&s;elf <HI>bound</HI> to fulfil.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cecilia begged Mi&s;s Audley's permi&s;&s;ion to
introduce Mrs. Spillman to her, as the acknowledged
wife of Sir Edward.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Audley received her with great civility, and
embraced her. She told her politely, how great|ly
&s;he was afflicted that &s;o unfortunate an events
had brought her to the knowledge of a per&s;on,
whom in her brother's life-time &s;he &s;hould have e&s;tee|med
her&s;elf happy to have called &s;i&s;ter. She expre&s;|&s;ed
her &s;orrow that her brother had nothing to leave
her but his name; and &s;aid that &s;he and her mama
&s;hould be extremely plea&s;ed to &s;ee her in London for
the little time they had to &s;tay there. Mrs Spillman
received her care&s;&s;es with great mode&s;ty; &s;he had put
on deep mourning; but not weeds. She &s;aid, with
regard to the fir&s;t article, it affected her but very
little, as by Mrs. Arnold's goodne&s;s &s;he was amply
provided for; and as for the &s;econd, You &s;ee, ma|dam,
&s;aid &s;he, pointing to her dre&s;s, that I meant
not to a&s;&s;ume a title after Sir Edward's decea&s;e, of
which he did not think me worthy during his life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Audley took her leave of the two ladies with
the warme&s;t demon&s;trations of regard, begging of
them to attribute her imprudent conduct to no wor&s;e
a motive than the true one, her &s;trong affection to a
brother, whom &s;he had &s;uffered to influence her too
far.</P>
<P>My lord V&mdash;and Sir George Bidulph came toge|ther
to Woodberry a few days after this. Mi&s;s Ce|cilia
had too much good &s;en&s;e, and too much acknow|ledgment
for her de&s;erving lover, to propo&s;e unne|ce&s;&s;ary

delays. She had already yielded her con&s;ent,
and Sir George Bidulph availing him&s;elf of Mrs.
Arnold's la&s;t reque&s;t, that the marriage &s;hould not
be deferred, he prevailed on his niece to fix the time
before he left her; and in a month afterwards my
lord V&mdash;had the happine&s;s to receive the <HI>willing</HI>
hand of the mo&s;t charming of women from her de|lighted
friends. Lady Sarah and Sir George came
down on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the ceremony, and Mr.
Price had the &s;atisfaction of joining a pair, formed
for, and worthy of each other.</P>
<P>My lord V&mdash;&s;et out with his lady the day after
their marriage for V&mdash;hall in Kent&punc; the antient &s;eat
of his family; the place where Mrs. Arnold's fir&s;t
acquaintance had commenced with the excellent
parents of this worthy lord. Mi&s;s Arnold accom|panied
them, and &s;eemed to quit with plea&s;ure a
place which &s;erved only to remind her of her grief.</P>
<P>My lord and lady V&mdash;earne&s;tly &s;ollicited Mr. Price
to take this journey with them, and to continue to
them what he had been to Mrs. Arnold, the friend, com|panion
and in&s;tructor; but the good old man begged
they would di&s;pen&s;e with him, &s;aying he wi&s;hed to
pa&s;s the &s;hort remains of his life with his beloved and
only child Mrs. Main; from whom nothing but his
gratitude and attachment to Mrs. Arnold could have
drawn him. His noble friends were obliged to acqui|e&s;ce.
He &s;taid but a few days at Woodberry after
their departure, in order to regulate &s;ome of their
dome&s;tic affairs, that they had left to his care. He
then repaired to London to pa&s;s the evening of his
days with a daughter and &s;on-in law, who are highly
de&s;erving of all his tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Spillman, who would never take the name of
Audley, retired about the &s;ame time to her friends in
Buckingham&s;hire.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland had during this interim &s;tood his trial
for the death of Sir Edward Audley, and was, on the
evidence of Mr. Bendi&s;h, acquitted. He immediately
withdrew privately from England without bidding
<PB N="159" REF="334">
adieu to one of his friends, and as he had before
re&s;olved, joined the army in quality of a volunteer.
My lord V&mdash;him&s;elf was obliged &s;oon to follow him,
and to quit his amiable lady at a time when he found
him&s;elf more than ever pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to her;
for the title of hu&s;band had but &s;erved to make him
di&s;cover that &s;he de&s;erved his friend&s;hip and his confi|dence,
as well as his admiration.</P>
<P>Lady V&mdash;, who determined to remain at her &s;eat
in Kent till his lord&s;hip's return, which was at that
time uncertain, recommended with a &s;weet ingenu|ou&s;ne&s;s,
Mr. Falkland to her lord's care. If it be in
your power, &s;aid &s;he, advance his fortune, and pro|mote
his glory; your genero&s;ity promi&s;ed me this at
a time when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the heart that is now wholly
your's; I hope you will not have le&s;s attention to him,
now that I con&s;ider him only as a brother.</P>
<P>Lord V&mdash;returned to England after the clo&s;e of
the campaign, in which Mr. Falkland had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf &s;o as to gain the reputation of &s;ingular brave|ry.
An event had al&s;o happened in his own country
during his ab&s;ence, by which he &s;aw him&s;elf very un|expectedly
re&s;tored to the inheritance of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who had &s;ucceeded to the greate&s;t part
of his father's e&s;tate was but a di&s;tant relation; he was
an old man and unmarried, and now dying without
heirs, he from a principle of ju&s;tice bequeathed to
young Falkland the fortune which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in con&s;equence of his father's misfortunes.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold was not as yet perfectly recovered from
her former malady; &s;ome traces of it &s;till remained,
which her friends, however, had hopes that time would
di&s;&s;ipate. A gentleman of high rank and fortune in
that country, who had ca&s;ually &s;een her a few times,
became pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her, and found means
to acquaint lady V&mdash;with his &s;entiments: who think|ing
that an amiable and de&s;erving lover would, &s;ooner
than any thing el&s;e, de$ach her &s;i&s;ter's heart from its
former unhappy ties, and con&s;equently re&s;tore her
mind to its right frame, received with &s;atisfaction his
<PB N="160" REF="335">
declaration, and promi&s;ed at her lord's return that he
&s;hould be permited to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Arnold. She &s;poke
of him in the mean while to her &s;i&s;ter in the mo&s;t ad|vantageous
terms; but found her utterly aver&s;e to the
thoughts of a new engagement. Lady V&mdash;, how|ever,
was not without hopes of overcoming by de|grees
a repugnance which &s;he con&s;idered only as the
re&s;ult of di&s;appointment; and on her lord's arrival
&s;he was in ha&s;te to communicate the affair to him. She
enlarged, in her &s;i&s;ter's pre&s;ence, on the merit, the
pa&s;&s;ion, and the con&s;iderable propo&s;als of Mi&s;s Ar|nold's
lover; and added, &s;miling, &s;he hoped he
would have his lord&s;hip's intere&s;t to promote his &s;uit.</P>
<P>I approve highly of the gentleman, &s;aid lord V&mdash;,
and &s;hould think it a happine&s;s to have a man of his
worth and con&s;ideration united to our family; but
before I engage in his cau&s;e, I mu&s;t acquit my&s;elf of
a commi&s;&s;ion which I promi&s;ed Mr. Falkland I would
faithfully fulfil.</P>
<P>He then informed the two ladies of the acqui&s;ition
Mr. Falkland had ju&s;t received to his fortune. It
was an e&s;tate of four thou&s;and pounds a year. Falk|land,
&s;aid he, though I had made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;eek
him out, had always avoided me; nor do I believe we
&s;hould ever have had any corre&s;pondence, had it not
been for this event. He wrote to me a few days before
my departure from Germany, and here is his letter.
My lord V&mdash;read it aloud to both the ladies.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland began with be&s;eeching lord V&mdash;to
blot from his memory his pa&s;t ill conduct, for which
he expre&s;&s;ed the &s;incere&s;t contrition; and acknowledg|ing
with the utmo&s;t gratitude his obligations to lord
V&mdash;, owned that &s;hame would not permit him
to do it per&s;onally. He then informs him of the large
fortune which was ju&s;t fallen to him, and proceeds
in the&s;e words: &startq;Were it not for this event, I &s;hould
wi&s;h that my very name might be forgotten, and that
Mi&s;s Arnold &s;hould never more call back to her re|collection
<PB N="161" REF="336">
the man who de&s;erves nothing from her
but contempt and aver&s;ion. I acknowledge, my
lord, I <HI>de&s;erve</HI> nothing el&s;e from her, and mu&s;t even
applaud her ju&s;tice, if the di&s;tinction with which
&s;he once honoured me is turned into di&s;dain: but, if
on the contrary the &s;ame fatality which fir&s;t impelled,
&s;hould &s;till per&s;i&s;t in attaching her inclinations to &s;o
unworthy an object, tell her I lay my&s;elf at her feet
not to make her an atonement, it would be a propha|nation
of the word to u&s;e it on this occa&s;ion; but to
deliver my&s;elf up to her ju&s;tice, and to endue her
with a power (pardon the boldne&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion)
like that of Omnipotence, either to pardon and re|ward
the repenting &s;inner, or to condemn him to
puni&s;hment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If &s;he pronounces the latter &s;entence, I may com|plain;
but cannot condemn her. If the former,
tell her, my lord, &s;he &s;hall find that a man who&s;e
heart has been early impre&s;&s;ed by principles of vir|tue,
however he may by pa&s;&s;ions have been hurried
into vice, cannot remain long a &s;lave to it; and that
her mildne&s;s, her &s;weet patience, and unexampled
tenderne&s;s are able to kindle an affection &s;tronger and
more la&s;ting, than her beauty, captivating as it is,
could ever in&s;pire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have mentioned to you, my lord, the fortune
of which I am now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not as a circum&s;tance
which can give me the lea&s;t merit with Mi&s;s Arnold,
or that I think can in the &s;malle&s;t degree intitle me
to her con&s;ideration; but to obviate the lighte&s;t &s;u&s;|picion
which her friends might entertain, that in|tere&s;t
could have any &s;hare in the declaration I now
make. I con&s;ider it indeed as the mo&s;t precious
advantage which I can derive from this unlooked for
benefit, that it permits me to di&s;cover tho&s;e &s;ecret
wi&s;hes which would otherwi&s;e have remained for
ever hid within my own brea&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>He concludes with mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjuring Lord
V&mdash;to acquaint Mi&s;s Arnold with his &s;entiments, and
to communicate to him her's on this important
&s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="337">
Lord V&mdash;having fini&s;hed reading the letter, It
re&s;ts on you, madam, &s;aid he to Mi&s;s Arnold, to give
an an&s;wer to Mr. Falkland. I have acquitted my|&s;elf
of my duly; but I would have you take a little
time to con&s;ider.&mdash;Con&s;ult your own heart, my dear,
&s;aid lady V&mdash;; I believe <HI>that</HI> after all mu&s;t deter|mine
you.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arnold turned towards her &s;i&s;ter; and addre&s;|&s;ing
her with a &s;ober and even commanding air, No,
Cecilia, &s;aid &s;he, I <HI>will</HI> not con&s;ult my heart, <HI>that</HI> has.
already betrayed me. I will con&s;ult my rea&s;on, &s;ince
Heaven has been plea&s;ed to re&s;tore it to me) I will
con&s;ult my honour; tho&s;e are the guides that &s;hall
henceforward direct your &s;i&s;ter's actions. My lord,
the &s;ubject requires <HI>no</HI> con&s;ideration; you &s;hall know
my &s;entiments this moment.</P>
<P>I loved Falkland from my childhood; but con&s;cious
that we were never meant for each other, I endeavour|ed
to &s;tifle a fatal pa&s;&s;ion, the con&s;equences of which
I had &s;o much rea&s;on to dread. I could not &s;ucceed
in my attempt, and then I had no re&s;ource left, but
to re&s;olve without divulging it to die a martyr to my
own imprudence. I was baffled in this de&s;ign too, my
&s;ecret was unhappily di&s;covered, and cruelly betrayed.
Yet at the &s;ame time was I deceived into a belief that
I was tenderly beloved. This belief, as it mitigated
the &s;hame I &s;uffered from my own acknowledged weak|ne&s;s,
&s;o did it &s;erve to &s;trengthen an affection already
but too deeply rooted in my heart; and when from
Falkland's own lips I received a confirmation of what
I had before been flattered with from others, I had not
re&s;olution enough to defend my&s;elf from giving him
(however contrary to my duty) the faith he de&s;ired. I
knew not at the time I made it by what means I &s;hould
be enabled to perform my promi&s;e; but we were both
very young. He was de&s;igned for the army. I was
in hopes that time, and his good conduct, might influ|ence
my uncle Bidulph in his favour; and for my dear
mama, who&s;e natural &s;oftne&s;s, joined to her fondne&s;s
for Mr. Falkland, left her heart as it were open to
<PB N="163" REF="338">
the a&s;&s;ault, I thought to have engaged you my &s;i&s;ter,
Mr. Price, and Mrs. B&mdash;to have worked upon her
tenderne&s;s; and when you, my good lord V&mdash;, fir&s;t
propo&s;ed to us the honour of your alliance, I thought
in you too to have obtained a powerful advocate.
The&s;e were my hopes, and upon the &s;trength of the&s;e
I ventured to &s;wear I never would be the wife of any
other man&mdash;Falkland, I never will! cried &s;he, &s;tretch|ing
out her arms as if he &s;tood before her. Lord and
lady V&mdash;were &s;tartled at her action, and looked at
each other; when &s;he proceeded, as if &s;till addre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to Falkland; Yet ob&s;erve I do not violate my
oath, when I declare I never will be <HI>your's.</HI> I here
(rai&s;ing up &s;olemnly her hands and eyes) devote
my&s;elf in the &s;ight of Heaven and the&s;e my friends to
a &s;ingle life. How truly I have loved you, let my
whole conduct witne&s;s. My tenderne&s;s was proof a|gain&s;t
a thou&s;and marks of coldne&s;s and neglect. Your
infidelity, avowed even under your own hand, could
not &s;hake my con&s;tancy; nay, even madne&s;s it&s;elf did
not di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s you of my heart! But the fir&s;t thing
that my recovered rea&s;on dictates me is, that I <HI>ought</HI>
not to be your wife. I owe this &s;acrifice (for &s;uch I
acknowledge it) to all my friends; but <HI>above</HI> all to
the honoured memory of my mama. I cannot <HI>atone</HI>
for my di&s;obedience; 'tis fit I &s;hould puni&s;h my&s;elf
for it. Yet 'tis a great con&s;olation to me, that I have
it in my power to refu&s;e that reparation which you
now offer to make me. Then recovering from the
tran&s;port in which &s;he appeared as it were to have
been rapt, and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to my lord V&mdash;,
You have now, my lord, heard my final determina|tion,
&s;aid &s;he; I have only to add, that I beg you
will let Mr. Falkland know what it is.</P>
<P>However lord and lady V&mdash;might in their hearts
approve her re&s;olution, they neverthele&s;s &s;aid nothing
to &s;trengthen her in it. Lord V&mdash;thought he owed
thus much to Mr. Falkland, who had reque&s;ted his
interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="339">
As the declaration Mi&s;s Arnold had made on this
occa&s;ion, was the fir&s;t regular explanation &s;he had
ever entered into upon the &s;ubject, &s;o was this the
fir&s;t time &s;ince her own misfortune that &s;he had ever
&s;hewed her&s;elf thoroughly mi&s;tre&s;s of her faculties;
but as the lo&s;s of the man &s;he had &s;o perfectly loved
had at fir&s;t deprived her of them, &s;o it &s;eemed as if the
having him re&s;tored to her (for that he &s;hould be &s;o,
depended entirely on her&s;elf) had in a great mea&s;ure
recalled to her the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; for it was
ob&s;erved that from that time &s;he every day appeared
more and more to recover her former judgment and
tranquillity, and in a little while &s;he was perfectly re|&s;tored,
though &s;he ever retained a &s;oft melancholy,
which time it&s;elf could not &s;ubdue. She kept her
word faithfully; for &s;he afterwards refu&s;ed &s;everal
con&s;iderable matches, pre&s;erving in her heart an in|violable
attachment to her fir&s;t ill-fated choice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, obliged to &s;ubmit to this &s;econd, and
more affecting di&s;appointment, returned not to En|gland
for many years. He afterwards ro&s;e to a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
rank in the army; but ever tenderly regret|ting
the lo&s;s of Mi&s;s Arnold, he, in imitation of her,
declared his re&s;olution of continuing &s;ingle. They<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mrs. A&s;kham, dates her Memoirs in the year 1738.</NOTE>
are both &s;o at the time the&s;e memoirs are written,
and will probably remain &s;o to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Audley and her mother made choice of a re|mote
province in France for their retreat, to which
they withdrew &s;oon after the death of Mrs. Arnold;
not, as Mi&s;s Audley had declared, from any di&s;incli|nation
to remain in England, but becau&s;e the &s;tate of
their affairs made a &s;cheme of frugality ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Audley, before her departure, left in the hands
of a friend all tho&s;e letters that had pa&s;&s;ed between
her and her brother that have appeared in this collec|tion,
as well as tho&s;e which Sir Edward had received
from Mr. Falkland; and Mr. Falkland him&s;elf had,
<PB N="165" REF="340">
immediately after his leaving Woodberry for the la&s;t
time, &s;ent to Mr. Price tho&s;e which Sir Edward Aud|ley
had written to him; and it was by this means
that they have been collected together.</P>
<P>Lady Audley died after about three years re&s;idence
in France. Her join are reverting to her younger &s;on,
a youth whom &s;he had left in England, Mi&s;s Audley
found her&s;elf &s;o &s;treightened in her circum&s;tances,
that &s;he thought it prudent to retire into a convent;
where the religious in le&s;s than a year prevailed on her
to turn Roman Catholic, and &s;oon after to become
one of their community. Mrs. A&s;kam &s;ays &s;he knew
a gentleman who was pre&s;ent when this unhappy
young lady made her profe&s;&s;ion in a convent of Car|thu&s;ian
nuns, one of the mo&s;t &s;evere orders in the
Romi&s;h Church.</P>
<P>She concludes her hi&s;tory with many &s;erious reflec|tions,
which though extremely pious and rational,
the editor chu&s;es to omit, thinking it a compliment
due to the judgment of his readers to leave them to
make reflections for them&s;elves.</P>
