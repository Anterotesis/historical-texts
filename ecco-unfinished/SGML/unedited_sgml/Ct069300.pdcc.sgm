<PB REF="5">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I am to depend intirely on the Favours of the Town; I think 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to give publick Rea&s;ons for publick Proceedings.</P>
<P>During the Rehear&s;al of the following Work, call'd, <HI>The Art of Management;</HI> or, <HI>Tragedy expell'd</HI>. I heard from different Hands that I was to &s;uffer from Civil Power, for exhibiting a Satyr on the Managers of <HI>Drury Lane</HI>. Now, Whether any one about Town know &s;uch Per&s;ons as Squire <HI>Brainle&s;s</HI>, or Mr. <HI>Bloodbolt</HI>, is doubtful; for I &s;olemnly prote&s;t I don't; I can't but &s;ay that I think the Name of <HI>Brainle&s;s</HI> very applicable to a <HI>Blockhead</HI>, as that of <HI>Bloodbolt</HI> may be to a <HI>Bully</HI>. And if there are any People in the World who act in real Life, as tho&s;e two Characters are &s;uppos'd to do, I am certain they mu&s;t be very much confounded and a&s;hamed to acknowledge them&s;elves piqued tho' the Cap &s;hould &s;it.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">And as for &s;atyrizing the Managers, I don't know that there are any Per&s;ons there who can properly claim that Title, for &s;ince the two Gentle|men (who governed &s;ix Years ago) have been dead, and the other quitted it, I don't know any one Circum&s;tance that has look'd like Order or Decorum during that Time, (a few Months ex|cepted) but of that I &s;hall &s;ay no more; le&s;t I grow vain (or at lea&s;t thought to be &s;o) in Com|mendation of one who truly de&s;erves my Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Farce, if any Gentleman thinks him|&s;elf touch'd home, or but &s;lightly glanced at, let me advi&s;e him to keep his Sentiments to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A prudent Man wou'd I'm &s;ure; and he mu&s;t be a mo&s;t egregious Fool who wou'd reject my Council.</P>
<P>But now I &s;hall proceed to give a ju&s;t Account of the Manner of my being di&s;charged, as to the Rea&s;ons, that will be as difficult a Task for me as for the Gentleman who did it; for he has often &s;poke of me as one, whom he thought, worth Ac|ceptance (as a Player) in any Theatre; therefore, any contrary Rea&s;on after &s;uch a Declaration wou'd be ridiculous; but I had a Letter &s;ent me, to inform me, the Charge being too high, made it nece&s;&s;ary to le&s;&s;en i$ by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me. I confe&s;s it was what I did not in the lea&s;t expect, as being ignorant of having de&s;erved it; when a Motion was made for my being recall'd, tho' not by me; I was refu&s;ed, and it was not long before we le&s;t off playing; (that I at a Quarter of an Hour's Warning, twice read two capital Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> The Queen in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>, and another Night <HI>Cleopatra)</HI>
<PB REF="7">
which, I believe, I did not appear &s;candalous in, if I may be allowed to judge by the good Nature of the Audience, tho' on &s;uch Occa&s;ions they are generally tender to young Players.</P>
<P>I can't but &s;ay 'tis hard to be deprived of the Means of an hone&s;t Livelihood, without giving &s;ome immediate Provocation; and for my private Mi&s;conduct, which it &s;eems, has been (for want of a better alledged as a Rea&s;on) tho' a bad one; for while my Follies only are hurtful to my &s;elf, I know no Right that any Per&s;ons, unle&s;s Relations, or very good Friends, have to call me to Account. I'll allow private Virtues heighten publick Merits, but then the Want of th&ograve;&s;e private Virtues wont affect an Actors Performance.</P>
<P>And for me, tho' I confe&s;s it with a Blu&s;h, I have paid &s;o little Regard to my &s;elf, that I ra|ther have made my Faults too con&s;picuous, than that I have conceal'd them; &s;o the Town will hardly be &s;urpriz'd at what they have been &s;o long acquainted with.</P>

<HEAD>An Occa&s;ional PROLOGUE Spoken by Mrs. CHARKE.</HEAD>
<L>WHEN the fir&s;t Pair from Paradice were driv'n,</L>
<L>They &s;i$h'd, thly $ept, and mourn'd their late&s;t Heav'n</L>
<L>With Grief unbounded, left their native Seat,</L>
<L>While re&s;ounding Echos, did their Woes repeat,</L>
<L>I, like them from ancient <HI>Drury</HI> expell'd,</L>
<L>Why I know not, yet helple&s;s to be repeal'd,</L>
<L>To this poor Refuge, unwillingly I flew,</L>
<L>And humbly refer my haple&s;s Cau&s;e to you;</L>
<L>When injured then the wor&s;t Judges we become,</L>
<L>And partial to our &s;elves heighten our Oppre&s;&s;or's Doom,</L>
<L>No, I rather chu&s;e your Pity than your Scorn&punc;</L>
<L>Of all Ills that's the harde&s;t to be born,</L>
<L>That I have Faults unlimited, I do confe&s;s,</L>
<L>Yet that, makes not the Wrong of o$hers le&s;s;</L>
<L>All my Hopes do on your Smiles depend,</L>
<L>Nay, my bounded Wi&s;hes ask no o$her Friend;</L>
<L>Since exil'd thus from my dear native Land,</L>
<L>And ca&s;t on Fortune's Stream; afford a &s;aving Hand.</L>
<L>Your friendly Pity I mu&s;t earne&s;tly implore,</L>
<L>And tenderly a&s;&s;i&s;t to waft me to the Shore,</L>
<L>With uwearied Toil I'll hourly &s;trive to plea&s;e,</L>
<L>If &s;ucce&s;sful think't a Conque&s;t gain'd with Ea&s;e,</L>
<L>To your good Nature ever pay a ju&s;t Regard,</L>
<L>And think each Effort too little for the &s;weet Reward.</L>

<P>WEll dear little <HI>Headpiece</HI>, now, methinks, 'tis as it &s;hou'd be. I am &s;o divided between Grief and Joy, that I &s;carce know which will take the deepe&s;t Root; but I believe my dear Boy, my Tran&s;port will &s;oon get the better of my Sorrow, for without Compliment to thee, I don't know the Man, who better de&s;erves to be Dame Fortune's fore|mo&s;t Favourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis almo&s;t an in&s;upportable Pain of Joy that I feel, and I my &s;elf am doubtful, that I have or ever can de&s;cribe it. How have you di&s;pos'd of poor <HI>Brainle&s;s?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Notand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! He's immur'd for Life: I can't &s;ay but his hard Fortune gives me infinite Di&s;tre&s;s, but 'tis quite irreparable; therefore &s;ince 'tis &s;o, we mu&s;t think as little of it as we can. However, I've a Petition to you, <HI>Head|piece</HI>, and to you Mrs. <HI>Tragic</HI>, but I mu&s;t have
<PB N="44" REF="43">
your Promi&s;e of Compliance, before I put the Que&s;tion to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You may command me, Sir; and <HI>Tragic</HI>, for my Sake, will as readily con&s;ent whate'er it be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trag.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'&s;t I am entirely at thy Devotion, therefore let <HI>Notandum</HI> &s;peak his Plea&s;ure freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Notand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thus then; &s;ince poor <HI>Brainle&s;s</HI> never can be him&s;elf again, let us mutually contribute to make his Bondage as ea&s;y as we can; therefore the fir&s;t Night you open, let it be for his Benefit; this will recommend you to the E&s;teem of every tender Heart, and give you Claim to their Regard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trag.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, I willingly agree; my Revenge is over&s;ated; I cou'd not have wi&s;hed him to have met with this cruel Fate, tho' he might have de&s;erved it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Name a Play, and we'll immediate|ly give Orders for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Notand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he de&s;ires you'll play <HI>All for Love</HI>, or, <HI>the Earl of E&s;&s;ex</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Tragic</HI> once read the Characters of <HI>Cleopatra</HI>, and the Queen at a Quarter of an Hours Warning; and tho' he confe&s;&s;es, that he has us'd her ill, yet he begs that &s;he'll con&s;ent to perform one of them for his Benefit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Head.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis equal to me what&mdash; But has he &s;o &s;oon forgot how he rai&s;ed the Devil in my Brea&s;t, when I &s;talk'd abroad, and the Play|hou&s;e Pa&s;&s;age trembled at my Roar.</P>

<P>No more of that, but learn at once to forgive, and if po&s;&s;ible forget.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trag.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Forget! forgive! I mu&s;t indeed for|get, when I forgive. Ha! the Memory of my Wrongs &s;till &s;ub&s;ide; yet I will re&s;olve with mo&s;t heroick Patience to &s;ubdue each angry Thought, and &s;often into Pity without one jar|ring Attom.</P>
