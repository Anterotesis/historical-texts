ON PUBLICATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not unamu&s;ing to con&s;ider the &s;e|veral
apologies that people make when
they commence authors. It is taken for granted
that on every publication there is at lea&s;t a
&s;eeming violation of mode&s;ty; a pre&s;umption,
on the writer's &s;ide, that he is able to in&s;truct
or to entertain the world; which implies a
&s;uppo&s;ition that he can communicate, what they
cannot draw from their own reflexions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">
To remove any prejudice this might occa|&s;ion,
has been the general intent of prefaces.
Some we find extremely &s;ollicitous to claim
acquaintance with their reader; addre&s;&s;ing him
by the mo&s;t tender and endearing appellations.
He is in general &s;tyled the mo&s;t loving, candid,
and courteous creature that ever breathed; with
a view, doubtle&s;s, that he will deferve the com|pliment;
and that his favor may be &s;ecured at
the expence of his better judgment. Mean
and idle expectation! The accidental elope|ments
and adventures of a compo&s;ition; the
danger of an imperfect and &s;urreptitious publi|cation;
the pre&s;&s;ing and indi&s;creet in&s;tances of
friends; the pious and well-meant frauds of
acquaintance; with the irre&s;i&s;tible commands of
per&s;ons in high life; have been excu&s;es often
&s;ub&s;tituted in place of the real motives, vanity
and hunger.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t allowable rea&s;ons for appearing
thus in public, are either the advantage or
amu&s;ement of our fellow-creatures; or our own
private emolument and reputation.</P>
<P>A MAN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of intellectual talents would
be more blameable in confining them to his
<PB N="5" REF="9">
own private u&s;e, than the mean-&s;pirited mi&s;er, that
did the &s;ame by his money. The latter is indeed
obliged to bid adieu to what he communicates;
the former enjoys his trea&s;ures, even while he
renders others the better for them. A compo|&s;ition
that enters the world with a view of im|proving
or amu&s;ing it, (I mean only, amu&s;ing
it in a polite or innocent way) has a claim to
our utmo&s;t indulgence, even though it fail of
the effect intended.</P>
<P>WHEN a writer's private intere&s;t appears
the motive of his publication, the reader has a
larger &s;cope for accu&s;ation, if he be a &s;ufferer.
Whoever pays for thoughts, which this kind of
writers may be &s;aid to vend, has room enough
to complain, if he be di&s;appointed of his bargain.
He has no revenge, but ridicule; and, contrary
to the practice in other ca&s;es, to make the wor&s;t
of a bad bargain.</P>
<P>WHEN the love of &s;ame acts upon a man
of genius, the ca&s;e appears to &s;tand thus. The
generality of the world, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of readers, ob&s;erve with a reluctance not
unnatural, a per&s;on rai&s;ing him&s;elf above them.
All men have &s;ome de&s;ire of fame, and fame is
<PB N="6" REF="10">
grounded on compari&s;on. Every one then is
&s;omewhat inclined to di&s;pute his title to a &s;upe|riority;
and to di&s;allow his preten&s;ions upon
the di&s;covery of a flaw. Indeed, a fine writer,
like a luminous body, may be beneficial to the
per&s;on he enlightens; but, it is plain, he renders
the opacity of the other more di&s;cernible&mdash;Exami|nation,
however, is a &s;ort of turnpike in the
way to fame, where, though a writer be a while
detained, and part with a trifle from his pocket,
he finds in return a more commodious and ea&s;y
road to the temple.</P>
<P>WHEN, therefore, a man is con&s;cious of
ability to &s;erve his country, or believes him&s;elf
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it (for there is no previous te&s;t on
this occa&s;ion) he has no room to he&s;itate, or
need to make apology&mdash;When &s;elf-intere&s;t
inclines a man to print, he &s;hould con&s;ider that
the purcha&s;er expects a pennyworth for his
penny; and has rea&s;on to a&s;per&s;e his hone&s;ty
if he finds him&s;elf deceived&mdash;Al&s;o, that it is
po&s;&s;ible to publi&s;h, a book of no value, which
is too frequently the product of &s;uch mercenary
people.&mdash;When fame is the principal object
of our devotion, it &s;hould be con&s;idered whether
our character is like to gain in point of wit, what
<PB N="7" REF="11">
it will probably lo&s;e in point of mode&s;ty:
otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be cen&s;ured of vanity more than
famed for genius; and depre&s;s our character while
we &s;trive to rai&s;e it.</P>
<P>AFTER all, there is a propen&s;ity in &s;ome
to communicate their thoughts without any view
at all$ the more &s;anguine of the&s;e employ the
pre&s;s; the le&s;s lively are contented with being
impertinent in conver&s;ation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="8" REF="12">
<HEAD>On the Te&s;t of popular opinion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAPPEN to fall into company with a citizen,
a courtier, and an academick.</P>
<P>SAYS the citizen, I am told continually of ta&s;te,
refinement, and politene&s;s; but methinks the
vulgar and illiterate generally approve the &s;ame
productions with the connoi&s;eurs. One rarely
finds a land&s;kip, a building, or a play that has
charms for the critick exclu&s;ive of the mechanick.
But on the other hand one readily remarks &s;tu|dents
who labour to be dull, depraving their
native reli&s;h by the very means they u&s;e to re|fine
it. The vulgar may not indeed be capable
of giving the rea&s;ons why a compo&s;ition plea&s;es
them. That mechanical di&s;tinction they leave
to the connoi&s;eur. But they are at all times
methinks judges of the beauty of an effect,
a part of knowledge in mo&s;t re&s;pects allowedly
more genteel than that of the operator.</P>
<P>SAYS the courtier, I cannot an&s;wer for every
individual in&s;tance; but I think moderately &s;peak|ing,
the vulgar are generally in the wrong. If
they happen to be otherwi&s;e, it is principally
$wing to their implicit reliance on the &s;kill of
<PB N="9" REF="13">
their &s;uperiors: and this has &s;ometimes been
&s;trangely effectual in making them imagine they
reli&s;h perfection. In &s;hort, if ever they judge
well, it is at the time they lea&s;t pre&s;ume to frame
opinions for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is true they will pretend to ta&s;te an object
which they know their betters do. But then
they con&s;ider &s;ome per&s;ons judgment as a cer|tain
&s;tandard or rule; they find the object ex|actly
tally; and this demon&s;trated appearance
of beauty affords them &s;ome &s;mall degree of
&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame with regard to the appetite from
which the metaphor of ta&s;te is borrowed. &startq;Such
a &s;oup or ollio, &s;ay they, is much in vogue, and
if you do not like it, you mu&s;t learn to like
it.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT in poetry, for in&s;tance, it is urged that
the vulgar, di&s;cover the &s;ame beauties with the
man of reading.</P>
<P>Now half or more of the beauties of poetry
depend on metaphor or allu&s;ion, neither of which,
by a mind uncultivated can be applied to their
<PB N="10" REF="14">
proper counterparts. Their beauty of con&s;e|quence
is like a picture to a blind man.</P>
<P>How many of the&s;e peculiarities in poetry
turn upon a knowledge of philo&s;ophy and hi&s;tory:
and let me add the&s;e latent beauties give the mo&s;t
delight to &s;uch as can unfold them.</P>
<P>I MIGHT launch out much further in regard
to the narrow limits of their apprehen&s;ions&mdash;What
I have &s;aid may exclude their infallibility;
and it is my opinion they are &s;eldom right.</P>
<P>THE Academic &s;poke little, but to the pur|po&s;e;
a&s;&s;erting that all ranks and &s;tations have
their different &s;pheres of judging: That a clown
of native ta&s;te enough to, reli&s;h Handel's Me&s;&s;iah,
might unque&s;tionably be &s;o in&s;tructed as to reli&s;h
it yet more: That an author, before he prints,
&s;hould not flatter him&s;elf with a confu&s;ed expec|tation
of plea&s;ing both the vulgar and the polite:
Few things, in compari&s;on, being capable of doing
both in any great degree: That he &s;hould always
mea&s;ure out his plan for the &s;ize of under&s;tand|ing
he would fit. If he can content him&s;elf with
the mob, he is pretty &s;ure of numbers for a
time. If he write with more abundant elegance,
<PB N="11" REF="15">
it may e&s;cape the organs of &s;uch readers; but
he will have a chance for &s;uch applau&s;e as will
more &s;en&s;ibly affect him. Let a writer then in
his fir&s;t performances neglect the idea of profit,
and the vulgar's applau&s;e entirely: Let him ad|dre&s;s
him to the judicious few, and then profit
and the mob will follow. His fir&s;t appearance
on the &s;tage of letters will engro&s;s the politer
compliments; and his latter will partake of the
irrational huzza.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="12" REF="16">
<HEAD>On allowing MERIT in OTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN gentleman was expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
as follows.</P>
<P>I CONFESS I have no great ta&s;te for poetry;
but if I had, I am apt to believe I &s;hould read no
other poetry than that of Mr. Pope. The re&s;t
but barely arrive at a mediocrity in their art;
and to be &s;ure poetry of that &s;tamp, can afford
but &s;lender plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I KNOW not, &s;ays another, what may be the
gentleman's motive to give this opinion: But I
am per&s;uaded numbers pretend the &s;ame through
mere jealou&s;y or enyy.</P>
<P>A READER con&s;iders an author, as one who
lays claim to a &s;uperior genius. He is ever in|clined
to di&s;pute it, becau&s;e if he happen to
Invalidate his title, he has at lea&s;t one &s;uperior
the le&s;s. Now though a man's ab&s;olute merit may
not depend upon the inferiority of another, yet
his comparative worth varies in regard to that of
other people. Self-love, therefore, is ever at|tentive
to pur&s;ue the &s;ingle point of admitting no
<PB N="13" REF="17">
more into the cla&s;s of &s;uperiors, than it is impo&s;&s;ible
to exclude. Could it even limit the number to
one, they would &s;oon attempt to undermine him.
Even Mr. Pope had been refu&s;ed his honours, but
that the very con&s;traint, and even ab&s;urdity of
people's &s;hutting their eyes grew as di&s;agreeable
to them, as that excellence, which, when open,
they could not but di&s;cover.</P>
<P>BUT &s;elf-love obtains it's wi&s;hes in another re|&s;pect
al&s;o. It hereby not only depre&s;&s;es the cha|racters
of many that have wrote, but &s;tifles the
genius of &s;uch as might hereafter ri&s;e from
among&s;t our inferiors.</P>
<P>LET us not deny to Mr. Pope the prai&s;es which
a per&s;on enamoured of poetry would be&s;tow on
one that excelled in it: But let us con&s;ider Par|na&s;&s;us
rather as a republick than a monarchy;
where, although &s;ome may be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
more cultivated &s;pot, yet where others my po&s;&s;e&s;s
land as fruitful, upon equal cultivation.</P>
<P>ON the whole, let us reflect, that the nature
of the &s;oil, and the extent of it's fertility mu&s;t
remain undi&s;covered, if the gentleman's de&s;ponding
principle &s;hould meet with approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18">
MR. POPE'S chief excellence lies in what I
would term con&s;olidating or conden&s;ing &s;entences,
yet pre&s;erving ea&s;e and per&s;picuity. In &s;mooth|ne&s;s
of ver&s;e, perhaps, he has been equalled:
In regard to invention, excelled.</P>
<P>ADD to this, if the writers of antiquity may
be e&s;teemed our true&s;t models, Mr. Pope is much
more witty, and le&s;s &s;imple, than his own Horace
appears in any of his writings. More witty, and
le&s;s &s;imple, than the modern Mon&s;. Boileau, who
claimed the merit of uniting the &s;tyle of Juvenal
and Per&s;ius with that of Horace.</P>
<P>SATYR gratifies &s;elf-love. This was one &s;ource
of his popularity; and he &s;eems even &s;o very
con&s;cious of it as to &s;tigmatize many inoffen&s;iv$
characters.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tance of what is called allitera|tion,
and the nice adju&s;tment of the pau&s;e have
con&s;pired to charm the pre&s;ent age, but have at
the &s;ame time given his ver&s;es a very cloying
peculiarity.</P>
<P>BUT, perhaps, we mu&s;t not expect to trace the
f$ow of Waller, the land&s;kip of Thom&s;on, the fire
<PB N="15" REF="19">
Dryden, the imagery of Shake&s;pear, the &s;impli|city
of Spen&s;er, the courtline&s;s of Prior, the hu|mour
of Swift, the wit of Cowley, the delicacy
of Addi&s;on, the tenderne&s;s of Otway, and the in|vention,
the &s;pirit, and &s;ublimity of Milton, joined
in any &s;ingle writer. The lovers of poetry, there|fore,
&s;hould allow &s;ome prai&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;hine
in any branch of it, and only range them into
cla&s;&s;es according to that &s;pecies in which they
&s;hine.</P>
<Q>&startq;Quare agite, O juvenes!</Q>
<P>Bani&s;h the &s;elf-deba&s;ing principle, and &s;corn
the di&s;ingenuity of readers. Humility has de|pre&s;&s;ed
many a genius into an hermit; but never
yet rai&s;ed one into a poet of eminence.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="16" REF="20">
<HEAD>THE IMPROMPTU.</HEAD>
<P>THE criticks, however unable to fix the
time which it is mo&s;t proper to allow for
the action of an epic poem, have univer&s;ally agreed
that &s;ome certain &s;pace is not to be exceeded.
Concerning this, Ari&s;totle, their great Lycurgus, is
entirely &s;ilent. Succeeding criticks have done little
more than cavil concerning the time really taken
up by the greate&s;t epick writers; that, if they
could not frame a law, they might at lea&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;h
a precedent of unexceptionable authority.
Homer, &s;ay they, confined the action of his Iliad,
or rather his action may be reduced, to the &s;pace of
two months. His Ody&s;&s;ey, according to Bo&s;&s;u and
Dacier, is extended to eight years. Virgil's Aeneid
has rai&s;ed very different opinions in his commen|tators.
Ta&s;&s;o's poem includes a &s;ummer&mdash;But
leaving &s;nch knotty points to per&s;ons that appear
born for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them, let us endeavor to
e&s;tabli&s;h laws that are more likely to be obeyed,
than controverted. An epic writer, though limited
in regard to the time of his action, is under no
&s;ort re&s;traint with regard to the time he
takes to fini&s;h his poem. Far different is the
ca&s;e with a writer of Impromptu's. He indeed is
allowed all the liberties that he can po&s;&s;ibly take
<PB N="17" REF="21">
in his compo&s;ition, but is rigidly circum&s;cribed with
regard to the &s;pace in which it is compleated.
And no wonder; for whatever degree of poig|nancy
may be required in this compo&s;ition, it's
peculiar merit mu&s;t ever be relative to the expe|dition
with which it is produced.</P>
<P>IT appears indeed to me to have the nature
of that kind of &s;allad, which certain eminent
adepts in chemi&s;try have contrived to rai&s;e, while
a joint of mutton is roa&s;ting. We do not allow
our&s;elves to blame it's unu&s;ual flatne&s;s and in&s;i|pidity,
but extoll the little flavour it has, con&s;i|dering
the time of it's vegetation.</P>
<P>AN extemporaneous poet, therefore, is to be
judged, as we judge a race-hor&s;e; not by the
gracefulne&s;s of his motion, but the time he takes
to fini&s;h his cour&s;e. The be&s;t critick upon earth
may err in determining his preci&s;e degree of
merit, if he have neither a &s;top-watch in his
hand, nor a clock within his hearing.</P>
<P>To be a little more &s;erious. An extempora|neous
piece ought to be examined by a compound
ratio, or a medium compounded of it's real worth,
and the &s;hortne&s;s of the time that is employed
<PB N="18" REF="22">
in it's production. By this rule even Virgil's
poem may be in &s;ome &s;ort deemed extemporaneous,
as the time he took to perfect &s;o extraordinary
a compo&s;ition, con&s;idered with it's real worth, ap|pears
&s;horter than the time employed to write the
di&s;ticks of Co&s;conius.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, I cannot allow this title
to the fla&s;hes of my friend S&mdash;in the maga|gazine,
which have no &s;ort of claim to be called
ver&s;es, be&s;ide their in&s;tantaneity.</P>
<P>HAVING ever made it my ambition to &s;ee my
writings di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;omething poignant,
unexpected, or, in &s;ome re&s;pects, peculiar; I
have acquired a degree of fame by a firm adhe|rence
to the Concetti. I have &s;tung folks with
my epigrams, amu&s;ed them with acro&s;ticks, puzzled
them with rebus's, and di&s;tracted them with rid|dles.
It remained only for me to &s;ucceed in the
Impromptu, for which I was utterly di&s;quali|fied
by a whore&s;on &s;lowne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>STILL de&s;irous, however, of the immortal
honor to grow di&s;tingui&s;hed for an extempore, I
petioned Apollo to that purpo&s;e in a dream.
His an&s;wer was as follows, &startq;That whatever
<PB N="19" REF="23">
piece of wit, either written or verbal, makes
any pretence to merit, as of extemporaneous
production, &s;hall be &s;aid or written within the
the time that the author &s;upports him&s;elf on
one leg. That Horace had explained his
meaning, by the phra&s;e STANS PEDE IN UNO.
And fora&s;much as one man may per&s;evere in
the po&s;ture longer than another, he would
recommend it to all candidates for this extra|ordinary
accompli&s;hment, that they would ha|bituate
them&s;elves to &s;tudy in no other attitude
what&s;oever.&endq;</P>
<P>METHOUGHT I received his an&s;wer with the
utmo&s;t plea&s;ure as well as veneration; hoping
that, however I was debarred of the acumen
requi&s;ite for an extempore, I might learn to
weary out my betters in &s;tanding on one leg.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB N="20" REF="24">
<HEAD>AN HUMOURIST.</HEAD>
<P>TO form an e&s;timate of the proportion which
one man's happine&s;s bears to another's,
we are to con&s;ider the mind that is allotted him
with as much attention, as the circum&s;tances. It
were &s;uperfluous to evince that the &s;ame objects
which one de&s;pi&s;es, are frequently to another
the &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ource of admiration. The man
of bu&s;ine&s;s and the man of plea&s;ure are to each
other mutually contemptible, and a blue garter
has le&s;s charms for &s;ome, than they can di&s;cover
in a butterfly. The more candid and &s;age ob|&s;erver
condemns neither for his pur&s;uits, but for
the deri&s;ion he &s;o profu&s;ely lavi&s;hes upon the
di&s;po&s;ition of his neighbour. He concludes that
&s;chemes infinitely various were at fir&s;t intended
for our pur&s;uit and plea&s;ure; and that &s;ome find
their account in heading a cry of hounds, as
much as others in the dignity of Lord Chief|Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>HAVING premi&s;ed thus much, I proceed to give
&s;ome account of a character which came within
the &s;phere of my own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25">
NOT the entrance of a cathedral, not the &s;ound
of a pa&s;&s;ing bell, not the furs of a magi&s;trate, nor
the &s;ables of a funeral were fraught with half
the &s;olemnity of face!</P>
<P>NAY &s;o wonderfully &s;erious was he ob&s;erved
to be on all occa&s;ions, that it was found hardly
po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e in his company. He
qua&s;hed the loude&s;t tempe&s;t of laughter, when|ever
he entered the room, and men's features
though ever &s;o much roughened, were &s;ure to
grow &s;mooth at his approach.</P>
<P>THE man had nothing vitious, or even ill|natured
in his character; yet he was the dread
of all jovial conver&s;ation; the young, the gay
found their &s;pirits fly before him. Even the
kitten and the puppy, as it were by in&s;tinct,
would forego their frolicks, and be &s;till. The
depre&s;&s;ion he occa&s;ioned was like that of a damp,
or vitiated air. Uncon&s;cious of any apparent
cau&s;e you found your &s;pirits &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly: And
were any one to &s;it for the picture of ill-luck, it
is not po&s;&s;ible the painter could &s;elect a more

<P><PB N="22" REF="26">
YET he not fail to boa&s;t of a &s;uperior &s;hare
of rea&s;on, even for the want of that very faculty,
ri&s;ibility, with which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be always
joined.</P>
<P>INDEED he acquired the character of the mo&s;t
ingenious per&s;on of his country, from this medita|tive
temper. Not that he had ever made any
great di&s;covery of his talents; but a few oracular
declarations, joined with a common opinion that
he was writing &s;omewhat for po&s;terity, compleated
his reputation.</P>
<P>NUMBERS would have willingly depretiated
his character, had not his known &s;obriety and re|puted
&s;en&s;e deterred them.</P>
<P>HE was one day overheard at his devotions,
returning his mo&s;t fervent thanks for &s;ome parti|cularities
in his &s;ituation which the generality of
mankind would have but little regarded.</P>
<P>ACCEPT, &s;aid he, the gratitude of thy mo&s;t
humble, yet mo&s;t happy creature, not for &s;ilver
or gold, the tin&s;el of mankind, but for tho&s;e
amiable peculiarities which thou ha&s;t &s;o graci|ou&s;ly

<HEAD>THE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IN THE MANNER OF CAMBRAY.</HEAD>
<P>'TWAS in that delightful month which
Love prefers before all others, and which
mo&s;t reveres his deity: that month which ever
weaves a verdant carpet for the earth, and em|broiders
it with flowers. The banks became in|viting
through their coverlets of mo&s;s: the vio|lets
refre&s;hed by the moi&s;ture of de&s;cending rains
enrich'd the tepid air with their agreeable per|fumes.
But the &s;hower was pa&s;t; the &s;un di&s;|per&s;ed
the vapours; and the &s;ky was clear and
lucid when Polydore walked forth. He was of
a complexion altogether plain and unaffected; a
lover of the Mu&s;es, and beloved by them. He
would oftentimes retire from the noi&s;e of mixt
conver&s;ation, to enjoy the melody of birds, or
the murmurs of a water-fall. His neighbours
often &s;miled at his peculiarity of temper; and
he no le&s;s, at the vulgar ca&s;t of theirs. He
could never be content to pa&s;s his irrevocable
time in an idle comment upon a news-paper, or
in adju&s;ting the preci&s;e difference of temperature
betwixt the weather of to-day and ye&s;terday.
In &s;hort he was not void of &s;ome ambition, but
<PB N="27" REF="31">
what he felt he acknowledged, and was never
aver&s;e to vindicate. As he never cen&s;ured any
one who indulged their humor inoffen&s;ively, &s;o he
claimed no manner of applau&s;e for tho&s;e pur&s;uits
which gratify'd his own. But the &s;entiments he
entertained of honor, and the dignity confered
by royal authority, made it wonderful how he
bore the thoughts of ob&s;curity and oblivion. He
mentioned with applau&s;e the youths who by me|rit
had arrived at &s;tation; but he thought that
all &s;hould in life's vi&s;it leave &s;ome token of their
exi&s;tence, and that their friends might more rea|&s;onably expect it from them, than they from their
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THERE were few, he thought, of talents &s;o ve|ry
incon&s;iderable, as to be unalterably excluded
from all degrees of fame: and in regard to &s;uch
as had a liberal education, he ever wi&s;hed that in
&s;ome art or &s;cience they would be per&s;uaded to
engrave their names. He thought it might be
&s;ome plea&s;ure to reflect, that their names would
at lea&s;t be honoured by their de&s;cendents, al|though
they might e&s;cape the notice of &s;uch as
were not prejudiced in their favor.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="32">
WHAT a lu&s;tre, &s;aid he, does the reputation of
a Wren, a Waller, or a Wal&s;ingham, ca&s;t upon
their remote&s;t progeny? and who would not wi&s;h
rather to be de&s;cended from them, than from the
mere carca&s;e of nobility? Yet wherever &s;uperb
titles are faithfully offered as the reward of me|rit,
he thought the allurements of ambition were
too tran&s;porting to be re&s;i&s;ted. But to return.</P>
<P>POLYDORE, a new inhabitant in a &s;ort of wild
un-inhabited country, was now a&s;cended to the
top of a mountain, and in the full enjoyment of
a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. Before him a broad
and winding valley, variegated with all the charms
of land&s;kip. Fertile meadows, glittering &s;treams,
pendent rocks, and nodding ruins. But the&s;e in|deed
were much le&s;s the objects of his attention,
than tho&s;e di&s;tant hills and &s;pires that were al|mo&s;t
concealed by one undi&s;tingui&s;hed azure.
The &s;ea indeed appeared to clo&s;e the &s;cene, tho'
di&s;tant as it was it but little variegated the view.
Hardly indeed were it di&s;tingui&s;hable but for the
beams of a de&s;cending &s;un, which at the &s;ame
time warned our traveller to return, before the
du&s;kine&s;s and dews of evening had rendered his
walk uncomfortable.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33">
HE had now de&s;cended to the foot of the
mountain, when he remarked an old hermit ap|proaching
to a little hut, which he had formed
with his own hands, at the very bottom of the
precipice. Polydore all enamoured of the beau|ties
he had been &s;urveying, could not avoid won|dering
at his conduct, who, not content with &s;hun|ning
all commerce with mankind, had contrived as
much as po&s;&s;ible to exclude all views of nature.
He acco&s;ted him in the manner following. Fa|ther,
&s;ays he, it is with no &s;mall &s;urprize, that I
ob&s;erve your choice of &s;ituation, by which you
&s;eem to neglect the mo&s;t di&s;tant and delightful land|&s;kip
that ever my eyes beheld. The hill beneath
which you have contrived to hide your habitation,
which would have afforded you &s;uch a variety
of natural curio&s;ities, as to a per&s;on &s;o contem|plative,
mu&s;t appear highly entertaining: and as
the cell to which you are advancing is &s;eemingly
of your own contrivance, methinks 'twas proba|ble
you would &s;o have placed it, as to pre&s;ent
them, in all their beauty, to your eye.</P>
<P>THE Hermit made him this an&s;wer. My &s;on,
&s;ays he, the evening approaches, and you have
deviated from your way. I would not therefore
detain you by my &s;tory, did I not imagine the
<PB N="30" REF="34">
moon would prove a &s;afer guide to you, than that
&s;etting &s;un which you mu&s;t otherwi&s;e rely upon.
Enter therefore for a while into my cave, and I
will give you then &s;ome account of my adven|tures
which will &s;olve your doubts perhaps more
effectually than any method I can propo&s;e. But
before you enter my lone abode, calculated only
for the u&s;e of meditation, dare to contemn &s;uper|fluous
magnificence, and render thy&s;elf worthy of
the being I contemplate.</P>
<P>KNOW then, that I owe what the world is
plea&s;ed to call my ruin (and indeed ju&s;tly, were
it not for the u&s;e which I have made of it) to an
a&s;&s;ured dependence, in a litteral &s;en&s;e, upon con|fu&s;ed
and di&s;tant pro&s;pects: a con&s;ideration, which
hath &s;o indeed affected me, that I &s;hall never
henceforth enjoy a land&s;kip that lies at &s;o remote
a di&s;tance as not to exhibit all it's parts. And
indeed were I to form the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to
to what your world calls ta&s;te, I might even then,
perhaps contend that a well di&s;criminated land|&s;kip
was at all times to be preferred to a di&s;tant
and promi&s;cuous azure.</P>
<P>I WAS born in the Pari&s;h of a nobleman who
arrived to the principal management of the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the nation. The heir of his family and
<PB N="31" REF="35">
my &s;elf were of the &s;ame age, and for &s;ome time
&s;chool-fellows. I had made con&s;iderable advances
in his e&s;teem, and the mutual affection we enter|tained
for each other, did not long remain unob|&s;erved
by his family or my own. He was &s;ent
early upon his travels, pur&s;uant to a very injudi|cious
cu&s;tom, and my parents were &s;ollicited to
con&s;ent that I might accompany him. Intimations
were given to my friends, that a per&s;on of &s;uch
importance as his father might contribute much
more to my immediate promotion, than the ut|mo&s;t
diligence I could u&s;e in pur&s;uit of it. My
father, I remember, a&s;&s;ented with reluctance:
my mother, fired with the ambition of her &s;on's
future greatne&s;s, through much importunity
&startq;wrung from him his &s;low leave.&endq; I, for my
own part, wanted no great per&s;ua&s;ion. We made
what is called the greater tour of Europe. We
neither of us, I believe, could be &s;aid to want
natural &s;en&s;e, but being bani&s;hed &s;o early in life,
were more attentive to every deviation from our
own indifferent cu&s;toms, than to any u&s;eful exa|mination
of their policies or manners. Judge|ment,
for the mo&s;t part, ripens very &s;lowly. Fan|cy
often expands her blo&s;&s;oms all at once.</P>
<P>WE Were now returning home from a &s;ix year's
ab&s;ence; anticipating the care&s;&s;es of our parents
<PB N="32" REF="36">
and relations, when my ever-honoured companion
was attacked by a fever. All po&s;fible means of
&s;afety proving finally ineffectual, he acco&s;ted me
in one of his lucid intervals as follows.</P>
<P>ALAS! my Clytander! my life, they tell me, is
of very &s;hort continuance. The next paroxy&s;m
of my fever will probably be conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;pect of this &s;udden change does not
allow me to &s;peak the gratitude I owe thee;
much le&s;s to reward the kindne&s;s on which it is
&s;o ju&s;tly grounded. Thou knowe&s;t I was &s;ent
away early from my parents, and the more rati|onal
part of my life has been pa&s;&s;ed with thee
alone. It cannot be but they will prove &s;ollici|tous
in their enquiries concerning me. Thy nar|rative
will awake their tenderne&s;s, and they can|not
but conceive &s;ome for their &s;on's companion
and his friend. What I would hope is that they
will render thee &s;ome &s;ervices, in place of tho&s;e
their beloved &s;on intended thee, and which I can
unfeignedly a&s;&s;ert, would have been only bound|ed
by my power. My dear companion! farewel.
All other temporal enjoyments have I bani&s;hed
from my heart; but friend&s;hip lingers long, and
'tis with tears I &s;ay farewell.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="37">
MY concern was truly &s;o great, that, upon my
arrival in my native country, it was not at all
encrea&s;ed by the con&s;ideration that the nobleman
on whom my hopes depended, was removed from
all his places. I waited on him; and he appear|ed
&s;en&s;ibly grieved that the friend&s;hip he had
ever profe&s;&s;ed could now &s;o little avail me. He
recommended me however to a friend of his that
was then of the &s;ucce&s;sful party, and who, he
was a&s;&s;ured, would, at his reque&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;t me to the
utmo&s;t of his power. I was now in the prime
of life, which I effectually con&s;umed upon the
empty forms of court-attendance. Hopes aro&s;e
before me like bubbles upon a &s;tream; as quick
&s;ucceeding one another, as &s;uperficial and as vain.
Thus bu&s;yed in my pur&s;uit, and rejecting the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cool examination, I found the win|ter
of life approaching, and nothing procured to
&s;helter or protect me when my &s;econd patron
dyed. A race of new ones appeared before me,
and even yet kept my expectations in play. I
wi&s;hed indeed I had retreated &s;ooner, but to re|tire
at la&s;t unrecompenced, and when a few
months attendance might happen to prove &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
was beyond all power of re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="38">
HOWEVER after a few years more attendance,
di&s;tributed in equal proportions upon each of
the&s;e new patrons, I at length obtained a place
of much trouble and &s;mall emolument. On the
acceptance of this, my eyes &s;eemed open all at
once. I had no pa&s;&s;ion remaining for the &s;plen|dor
which was grown familiar to me, and for &s;er|vility
and confinement I entertained an utter a|ver&s;ion.
I officiated however for a few weeks in
my po&s;t, wondering &s;till more and more how I
could ever covet the life I led. I was ever mo&s;t &s;in|cere,
but &s;incerity cla&s;hed with my &s;ituation every
moment of the day. In &s;hort, I returned home to
a &s;mall paternal income, not indeed intending
that au&s;tere life in which you at pre&s;ent find me
engaged. I thought to content my&s;elf with com|mon
nece&s;&s;aries, and to give the re&s;t, if aught
remained, to charity, but to avoid all appearance
of &s;ingularity. But alas! to my great &s;urprize,
the per&s;on who &s;upplied my expences had &s;o far
embroiled my little affairs, that, when my debts,
&amp;c were di&s;charged, I was unable to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in
any better manner than I do at pre&s;ent. I grew
at fir&s;t entirely melancholy; left the country
where I was born, and rai&s;ed the humble roof
that covers me in a country where I am not
known. I now begin to think my&s;elf happy in
<PB N="35" REF="39">
my pre&s;ent way of life: I cultivate a few vege|tables
to &s;upport me, and the little well there is
a very clear one. I am now an u&s;ele&s;s individu|al;
little able to benefit mankind; but a prey to
&s;hame and to confu&s;ion, on the fir&s;t glance of
every eye that knows me. My &s;pirits are indeed
&s;omething rai&s;ed by a clear &s;ky, or a meridian
&s;un, but as to exten&s;ive views of the country, I
think them well enough exchanged for the warmth
and comfort which this vale affords me. Ea&s;e is
at lea&s;t the proper ambition of age, and it is
confe&s;&s;edly my &s;upreme one.</P>
<P>Yet will I not permit you to depart from an
hermit without one in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on. Whatever
&s;ituation in life you ever wi&s;h or propo&s;e for
your&s;elf, acquire a clear and lucid idea of the in|conveniences
attending it. I utterly contemned
and rejected, after a month's experience, the very
po&s;t I had all my life-time been &s;ollicitous to pro|cure.</P>

<P>THE &s;ubject turned upon the nature of
&s;ocieties, ranks, orders, and di&s;tinctions,
among&s;t men.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN of &s;pirit, and of the popular
faction, had been long declaiming again&s;t any
kind of honours that, tended to elevate a body
of people into a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the re&s;t of
the nation. Particularly titles and blue ribbands
were the object of his indignation. They were,
as he pretended, too invidious an o&s;tentation of
&s;uperiority, to be allowed in any nation that
&s;tyled it&s;elf free. Much was &s;aid upon the &s;ub|ject
of appearances &s;o far as they were counte|nanced
by law or cu&s;tom. The bi&s;hop's lawn;
the mar&s;hal's truncheon; the baron's robe; and
the judge's peruke, were con&s;idered only as ne|ce&s;&s;ary
&s;ub&s;titutes, where genuine purity, real
courage, native dignity, and &s;uitable penetra|tion
were wanting to compleat the characters of
tho&s;e to whom they were a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="41">
IT was urged that policy had often effectually
made it a point to dazzle in order to en&s;lave; and
in&s;tances were brought of groundle&s;s di&s;tinctions
born about in the glare of day by certain per&s;ons,
who, being &s;tripped of them, would be le&s;s

<P>HE acknowledged, indeed, that kings, the

&s;hewn no complai&s;ance to that &s;ex who&s;e &s;ofter

one order, which &s;hould be &s;tyled The mo&s;t
powerful order of beauties.</P>

<P>THAT the in&s;tallment &s;hould be rendered a thou|&s;and

intermixed with a branch of myrtle, the tree
&s;acred to Venus.</P>
<P>THAT in&s;tead of their &s;hields being affixed
to the &s;talls appointed for this order, there
&s;hould be a gallery erected to receive their pic|tures

right honorable when he grew a &s;candal to

THE company was a little &s;urprized at the

<HEAD>On the &s;ame SUBJECT.</HEAD>
<P>THE declaimant, I before mentioned,
continued his harangue. There are,
&s;aid he, certain epithets which &s;o frequently oc|cur,
that they are the le&s;s con&s;idered; and which
are &s;eldom or never examined, on account of
the many opportunities of examination that pre|&s;ent
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OF this kind is the word Gentleman. This
word, on it's fir&s;t introduction, was given, I &s;up|po&s;e,
to freemen in oppo&s;ition to va&s;&s;als; the&s;e
being the two cla&s;&s;es into which the nation was
once divided<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As the author is not writing a treati&s;e on the feudal law, but a moral e&s;&s;ay, any little inaccurracies, it is to be hoped, will be over-looked by tho&s;e, who, from &s;everal late treati&s;es on this &s;ubject, might expect great exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion in a &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point.</NOTE>. The freeman was he, who was
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of land, and could therefore &s;ub&s;i&s;t
without manual labor; the va&s;&s;al, he, who te|nanted
the land, and was obliged to his thane
for the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The different man|ners,
we may pre&s;um$, that &s;prung from their
different &s;ituations and connexions occa&s;ioned the
<PB N="42" REF="46">
one to be denominated a civilized or gentle per|&s;onage;
and the other to obtain the name of a
mere ru&s;tic or villain.</P>
<P>BUT upon the publication of cru&s;ades, the
&s;tate of things was con&s;iderably altered: It was
then that every freeman di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;hield
which he wore with &s;ome painted emblem or
device; and this, in order that his fellow-com|batants
might attribute to, him his proper ap|plau&s;e,
which, upon account of &s;imilar accoutre|ments,
might be otherwi&s;e &s;ubject to mi&s;appli|cation.</P>
<P>UPON this there aro&s;e a di&s;tinction betwixt
freeman and freeman. All which had &s;erved, in
tho&s;e religious wars continued the u&s;e of their
fir&s;t devices, but all devices were not illu&s;trated
by the &s;ame preten&s;ions to military glory.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the&s;e campaigns were di&s;continued:
Fre&s;h families &s;prung up; who, without any pre|tence
to mark them&s;elves with &s;uch devices as
the&s;e holy combatants, were yet as de&s;irous of
re&s;pect, of e&s;timation, of di&s;tinction. It would
be tedious enough to trace the &s;teps by which
money e&s;tabli&s;hes even ab&s;urdity. A court of
heraldry &s;prung up to &s;upply the place of cru&s;ade
<PB N="43" REF="47">
exploits, to grant imaginary &s;hields and trophies
to families that never wore real armour, and it
is but of late that it has been di&s;covered to have
no real juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>YET cu&s;tom is not at once overthrown; and
he is even now deemed a gentleman who has
arms recorded in the Herald's office, and at
the &s;ame time follows none, except a liberal em|ployment.</P>
<P>ALLOWING this di&s;tinction, it is obvious to all
who con&s;ider, that a churli&s;h, moro&s;e, illiterate
clown; a lazy, beggarly, &s;harping vagabond; a
&s;tupid, lubberly, inactive &s;ot, or pick-pocket,
nay even an highwayman, may be neverthele&s;s a
gentleman as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. In &s;hort, that
the definition, may, together with others, include
al&s;o the filth, the &s;cum, and the dregs of the
creation.</P>
<P>BUT do we not appear to di&s;allow this ac|count,
when we &s;ay &startq;&s;uch or &s;uch an action was
not done in a gentleman-like manner.&endq; &startq;Such
u&s;age was not the behavior of a gentleman,&endq; and &s;o
forth. We &s;eem thus to in&s;inuate that the appel|lation
of gentleman regards morals as well as fa|mily;
<PB N="44" REF="48">
and that integrity, politene&s;s, genero&s;ity,
and affability, have the true&s;t claim to a di&s;tinc|tion
of this kind. Whence then &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e
was derived this contradiction? Shall we &s;ay that
the plebeians, having the virtues on their &s;ide,
by degrees removed this appellation from the
ba&s;is of family to that of merit; which they
e&s;teemed, and not unju&s;tly, to be the true and
and proper pede&s;tal? This the gentry will &s;carce
allow. Shall we then in&s;i&s;t that every thing
great and god-like was heretofore the atchieve|ment
of the gentry? But this, perhaps, will not
obtain the approbation of the commoners.</P>
<P>To reconcile the difference, let us &s;uppo&s;e the
denomination may belong equally to two &s;orts
of men. The one, what may be &s;tyled a gentle|man
de jure, viz. a man of genero&s;ity, politene&s;s,
learning, ta&s;te, genius, or affability; in &s;hort,
accompli&s;hed in all that is &s;plendid, or endeared
to us by all that is amiable on the one &s;ide; and
on the other, a gentleman de facto, or what, to
Engli&s;h readers, I would term a gentleman as by
law e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As to the latter appellation, what is really e&s;|&s;ential,
or, as logicians would &s;ay, &startq;quarto modo
proprium,&endq; is a real, or at lea&s;t a &s;pecious claim
<PB N="45" REF="49">
to the inheritance of certain coat-armour from a
&s;econd or more di&s;tant ance&s;tor; and this un|&s;tained
by any mechanical or illiberal employ|ment.</P>
<P>WE may di&s;cover, on this &s;tate of the ca&s;e,
that, however material a difference this di|&s;tinction
&s;uppo&s;es, yet it is not wholly impracti|cable
for a gentleman de jure, to render him&s;elf
in &s;ome &s;ort a gentleman de facto. A certain
&s;um of money, depo&s;ited in the hands of my
good friends Norroy or Rouge-dragon, will con|vey
to him a coat of arms de&s;cending from as
many ance&s;tors as he plea&s;es. On the other
hand, the gentleman de facto may become a gen|tleman
al&s;o de jure, by the acqui&s;ition of certain
virtues, which are rarely all of them unattainable.
The latter, I mu&s;t acknowledge, as the more
difficult ta&s;k; at lea&s;t we may daily di&s;cover
crowds acquire &s;ufficient wealth to buy gentility,
but very few that po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues which ennoble
human nature, and (in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word)
con&s;titute a GENTLEMAN.</P>

<HEAD>A CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;HE was a youth &s;o amply furni&s;hed
with every excellence of mind, that
he $eeined alike capable of acquiring or di&s;re|garding
the goods of fortune. He had indeed
all the learning and erudition that can be de|rived
from univer&s;ities, without the pedantry and
ill manners which are too often their attendants.
What few or none acquire by the mo&s;t inten&s;e
a&s;&s;iduity, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by nature; I mean that
elegance of ta&s;te, which di&s;po&s;ed him to admire
beauty under its great variety of appearances.
It pa&s;&s;ed not unob&s;erved by him either in the
cut of a &s;leeve, or the integrity of a moral action.
The proportion of a &s;tatue, the convenience of
an edifice, the movement in a dance, and the
complexion of a cheek or flower afforded him
&s;en&s;ations of beauty; that beauty which inferior
genius's are taught coldly to di&s;tingui&s;h; or to
di&s;cern rather than feel. He could trace the ex|cellencies
both of the courtier and the &s;tudent; who
are mutually ridiculous in the eyes of each other.
He had nothing in his character that could ob&s;cure
&s;o great accompli&s;hments, be&s;ide the want, the
total want, of a de&s;ire to exhibit them. Through
<PB N="47" REF="51">
this it came to pa&s;s, that what would have rai&s;ed
another to the heights of reputation, was often|times
in him pa&s;&s;ed over unregarded. For, in
re&s;pect to ordinary ob&s;ervers, it is requi&s;ite to
lay &s;ome &s;tre&s;s your&s;elf, on what you intend
&s;hould be remarked by others; and this never
was his way. His knowledge of books had in
&s;ome degree dimini&s;hed his knowledge of the world;
or, rather, the external forms and manners of
it. His ordinary conver&s;ation was, perhaps, ra|ther
too pregnant with &s;entiment, the u&s;ual fault
of rigid &s;tudents; and this he would in &s;ome
degree have regulated better, did not the uni|ver&s;ality
of his genius, together with the me|thod
of his education, &s;o largely contribute to
this amiable defect. This kind of awkwardne&s;s
(&s;ince his mode&s;ty will allow it no better name)
may be compared to the &s;tiffne&s;s of a fine piece
of brocade, who&s;e turge&s;cency indeed con&s;titutes,
and is in&s;eparable from it's value. He gave de|light
by an happy boldne&s;s in the extirpation of
common prejudices; which he could as readlly
penetrate, as he could humourou&s;ly ridicule:
And he had &s;uch entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hearts,
as well as under&s;tandings of his friends, that he
could &s;oon make the mo&s;t &s;urprizing paradoxes
believed and well-accepted. His image, like that
<PB N="48" REF="52">
of a &s;overeign, could give an additional value to
the mo&s;t precious ore; and we no &s;ooner believed
our eyes, that it was he who &s;pake it, than we as
readily believed whatever he had to &s;ay. In this
he differed from W&mdash;r, that he had the talents
of rendering the greate&s;t virtues un-envied:
Whereas the latter &s;hone more remarkably in
making his very faults agreeable: I mean in
regard to tho&s;e few he had to exerci&s;e his
&s;kill.</P>

<HEAD>ON RESERVE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING an evening's walk with a friend
in the country, among many grave re|marks,
he was making the following ob&s;erva|tion.
There is not, &s;ays he, any one quality &s;o
incon&s;i&s;tent with re&s;pect, as what is commonly
called familiarity. You do not find one in fifty
who&s;e regard is proof again&s;t it. At the &s;ame
time it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a
deference as will render you ridiculous, if it
be &s;upported by common &s;en&s;e. Thus much
at lea&s;t is evident, that your demands will be
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as to procure a greater &s;hare
than if you had made no &s;uch demand. I
may frankly own to you, Leander, that I fre|quently
derived unea&s;ine&s;s from a familiarity
with &s;uch per&s;ons as de&s;pi&s;ed every thing they
could obtain with ea&s;e. Were it not better,
therefore, to be &s;omewhat frugal of our affabi|lity,
at lea&s;t to allot it only to the few per&s;ons
of di&s;cernment who can make the proper di&s;tinc|tion
betwixt real dignity and pretended: To ne|glect
tho&s;e characters, which, being impatient to
grow familiar, are at the &s;ame time very far from
familiarity-proof: To have po&s;thumous fame in
<PB N="50" REF="54">
view, which affords us the mo&s;t plea&s;ing land&s;kip:
To enjoy the amu&s;ement of reading, and the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that reading paves the way to gene|ral
e&s;teem: To pre&s;erve a con&s;tant regularity
of temper, and al&s;o of con&s;titution, for the mo&s;t
part but little con&s;i&s;tent with a promi&s;cuous in|tercour&s;e
with men: To &s;hun all illiterate, though
ever &s;o jovial a&s;&s;emblies, in&s;ipid, perhaps, when
pre&s;ent, and upon reflexion painful: To medi|tate
on tho&s;e ab&s;ent or departed friends, who va|lue
or valued us for tho&s;e qualities with which
they were be&s;t acquainted: To partake with
&s;uch a friend as you, the delights of a &s;tudious
and rational retirement&mdash;Are not the&s;e the
paths that lead to happine&s;s?</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this (for he &s;eemed to feel &s;ome
late mortification) I ob&s;erved, that what we lo&s;t
by familiarity in re&s;pect, was generally made up
to us by the affection it procured; and that an
ab&s;olute &s;olitude was &s;o very contrary to our
natures, that were he excluded from &s;ociety,
but for a &s;ingle fortnight, he would be exhila|rated
at the &s;ight of the fir&s;t beggar that he
&s;aw.</P>
<P>WHAT follows were thoughts thrown out in
our further di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject; without
<PB N="51" REF="55">
order or connexion, as they occur to my re|membrance.</P>
<P>SOME re&s;erve is a debt to prudence; as free|dom
and &s;implicity of conver&s;ation is a debt to
good-nature.</P>
<P>THERE would not be any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity
for re&s;erve, if the world were hone&s;t: Yet, even
then, it would prove expedient. For in order to
attain any degree of deference, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary
that people &s;hould imagine you have more ac|compli&s;hments
than you di&s;cover.</P>
<P>IT is on this depends one of the excellencies
of the judicious Virgil. He leaves you &s;ome|thing
ever to imagine: And &s;uch is the con&s;ti|tution
of the human mind, that we think &s;o
highly of nothing, as of that whereof we do
not &s;ee the bounds. This, as Mr. Burke ingeni|ou&s;ly
ob&s;erves, affords the plea&s;ure when we &s;ur|vey

<P>To be, however, a niggard of one's ob&s;erva|tions,
is &s;o much wor&s;e than to hoard up one's mo|ney,

<HEAD>ON EXTERNAL FIGURE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a young gentleman in my pa|ri&s;h,
who, on account of his &s;uperior e|quipage,
is e&s;teemed univer&s;ally more proud and
more haughty than his neighbours. 'Tis frequent|ly
hinted, that he is by no means entitled to &s;o
&s;plendid an appearance, either by his birth, his
&s;tation, or his fortune; and that it is, of con|&s;equence,
mere pride that urges him to live be|yond
his rank, or renders him blind to the know|ledge
of it. With all this fondne&s;s for external
&s;plendor, he is a mo&s;t affable and ingenious man;
and for this rea&s;on I am inclined to vindicate him,
when the&s;e things are mentioned to his di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, it is by no means clear, that
dre&s;s and equipage are &s;ure &s;igns of pride. Where
it is joined with a &s;upercilious behaviour, it be|comes
then a corroborative te&s;timony. But this
is not always the ca&s;e: The refinements of lux|ury
in equipage or a table, are perhaps as often
the gratifications of fancy, as the con&s;equence of
an ambition to &s;urpa&s;s and eclip&s;e our equals.
Whoever thinks that ta&s;te has nothing to do here,

them, wholly independent of worldly homage

I am &s;ometimes prompted to go further. I
in&s;i&s;t, it is not birth or fortune only that give a
per&s;on claim to a &s;plendid appearance; that it
may be conferred by other qualifications in which
my friend is acknowledged to have a &s;hare.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes urged that remarkable inge|nuity,
any great degree of merit in learning, arts
or &s;ciences, are a more rea&s;onable authority for
a &s;plendid appearance than tho&s;e which are com|monly
pre&s;umed to be &s;o. That there is &s;ome|thing
more per&s;onal in this kind of advantages
than in rank or fortune will not be denied: and
&s;urely there ought to be &s;ome proportion ob&s;erv|ed
betwixt the ca&s;e and the thing enclo&s;ed. The
propen&s;ity of rich and worthle&s;s people to ap|pear
with a &s;plendour upon all occa&s;ions, puts
one in mind of the country &s;hop-keeper who
gilds his boxes in order to be the receptacle of
pitch or tobacco. 'Tis not unlike the manage|ment
at our theatres royal, where you &s;ee a piece
of candle honored with a crown.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">
I HAVE generally con&s;idered tho&s;e as privileged
people, who are able to &s;upport the character
they a&s;&s;ume. Tho&s;e who are incapable of &s;hin|ing,
but by dre&s;s, would do well to con&s;ider that
the contra&s;te betwixt them and their cloathes
turns out much to their di&s;advantage. 'Tis on
this account I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved with plea|&s;ure
&s;ome noblemen of immen&s;e fortune to dre&s;s
exceedingly plain.</P>
<P>IF dre&s;s be only allowable to per&s;ons of fami|ly,
it may then be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of family|livery,
and Jack the groom may with equal ju&s;t|ice
pride him&s;elf upon the gawdy wardrobe his
ma&s;ter gives him. Nay more&mdash;For a gentleman,
before he hire a &s;ervant, will require &s;ome te&s;ti|mony
of his merit; whereas the ma&s;ter challenges
his own right to &s;plendour, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no
merit at all.</P>
<P>UPON my pre&s;ent &s;cheme of dre&s;s, it may &s;eem
to an&s;wer &s;ome very good purpo&s;es. It is then
e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ame foundation, as the judge's
robe and the prelate's lawn. If dre&s;s were only
authorized in men of ingenuity, we &s;hould, find
many aiming at the previous merit, in hopes of
<PB N="61" REF="65">
the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tinction. The finery of an
empty fellow would render him as ridiculous as
a &s;tar and garter would one never knighted: And
men would u&s;e as commendable a diligence to
qualify them&s;elves for a brocaded wai&s;tecoat, or a
gold &s;nuff-box, as they now do to procure them|&s;elves
a right of inve&s;ting their limbs in lawn or
ermine. We &s;hould not e&s;teem a man a coxcomb
for his dre&s;s, till, by frequent conver&s;ation, we
di&s;covered a flaw in his title. If he was incapa|ble
of uttering a bon mot, the gold upon his
coat would &s;eem foreign to his circum&s;tances. A
man &s;hould not wear a French dre&s;s, till he could
give an account of the be&s;t French authors; and
&s;hould be ver&s;ed in all the oriental languages
before he &s;hould pre&s;ume to wear a diamond.</P>
<P>IT may be urged, that men of the greate&s;t me|rit
may not be able to &s;hew it in their dre&s;s, on
account of their &s;lender income. But here it
&s;hould be con&s;idered that another part of the
world would find their equipage &s;o much re|duced
by a &s;umptuary law of this nature, that
a very moderate degree of &s;plendour would
di&s;tingui&s;h them more than a greater does at
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66">
WHAT I propo&s;e however upon the whole is,
that men of merit &s;hould be allowed to dre&s;s
in proportion to it; but this with the privilege
of appearing plain, whenever they found an ex|pediency
in &s;o doing: As a nobleman lays a&s;ide
his garter, when he &s;ees no valuable con&s;equence
in the di&s;covery of his quality.</P>

<P>I WAS taking a view of We&s;tmin&s;ter abby, with

that it was a brave antient place.</P>
<P>I TOLD him, I thought there was none more
&s;uitable, to moralize upon the futility of all
earthly glory, as there was none which contain|ed
the a&s;hes of men that had acquired a greater

<P>SILENCE en&s;ued for many minutes; when hav|ing

<P>I APPLAUDED the ju&s;tice of his ob&s;ervation;

had been &s;o for, a number of years. &startq;Right,&endq;
&s;ays he, &startq;and for my own part I &s;eldom love to

&startq;experience.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t maxim, &s;omewhat beyond his u&s;ual
depth, occa&s;ioned a &s;ilence of &s;ome few minutes.
The &s;pring had been too much bent to recover
immediately it's wonted vigour. We had taken
&s;ome few turns, up and down the left hand ayle,
when he caught &s;ight of a monument &s;omewhat
larger than the re&s;t, and more calculated to make
impre&s;&s;ion upon an ordinary imagination. As I
remember, it was rai&s;ed to an ance&s;tor of the D.

&startq;of any &s;ignification to the per&s;on buryed there.&endq;
I told him, I thought not, and that, under a no|tion

frequently impo&s;ed upon by their own pride and
affectation.</P>
<P>WE were now arrived at the monument of
Sir George Chamberlain; where my friend had
ju&s;t peru&s;ed enough to inform him that he was
an eminent phy&s;ician, when he broke out with
precipitation, and as tho' &s;ome important di&s;co|very
had &s;truck his fancy on a &s;udden. I li&s;ten|ed
to him with attention, till I found him labour|ing
<PB N="66" REF="70">
to in&s;inuate that phy&s;icians them&s;elves could
not &s;ave their lives when their time was come.</P>
<P>HE had not proceeded many &s;teps from it be|fore
he beckoned to our Ciceroni. &startq;Friend,&endq;

hoped not; and immediately took my leave.</P>
<P>THIS old gentleman, as I have &s;ince heard,
pa&s;&s;ed his life chiefly in the country; where it
faintly participated either of plea&s;ure or of pain.
His chief delights indeed were &s;en&s;ual, but tho&s;e
of the le&s;s vigorous kind, an afternoon's pipe,
an evening walk, or a nap after dinner. His death,
which happened, it &s;eems, quickly after, was oc|ca&s;ioned
by an uniform application to Bo&s;tock's
cordial, whatever his ca&s;e required. Indeed his
di&s;cour&s;e, when any complained of &s;ickne&s;s, was
<PB N="67" REF="71">
a little exuberant in the prai&s;es of this noble cath|artick.
But his di&s;temper proving of a nature
to which this remedy was wholly foreign, as well
as this precluding the u&s;e of a more effectual re|cipe,
he expired, not without the character of a
mo&s;t con&s;iderate per&s;on. I find by one part of
his will, he obliged his heir to con&s;ume a certain
quantity of ale among his neighbours, on the day
he was born; and by another, left a ring of bells
to the church adjoining to his garden. It looks
as if the old gentleman had not only an aver&s;ion
to much reflexion in him&s;elf, but endeavoured to
provide again&s;t it in &s;ucceeding generations.</P>

<HEAD>AN OPINION OF GHOSTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the belief of
gho&s;ts and apparitions of per&s;ons departed,
has lo&s;t ground within the&s;e fifty years. This
may perhaps be explained by the general growth
of knowledge; and by the con&s;equent decay of
&s;uper&s;tition, even in tho&s;e kingdoms, where it is
mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially interwoven with their religion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame credulity which di&s;po&s;ed the mind
to believe the miracles of a popi&s;h &s;aint, &s;et a&s;ide
at once the interpo&s;ition of rea&s;on; and produced
a fondne&s;s for the marvellous, which it was the
prie&s;t's advantage to promote.</P>
<P>IT may be natural enouch to &s;uppo&s;e that a
belief of this kind might &s;pread in the days of
popi&s;h infatuation. A belief, as much &s;upported
by ignorance, as the gho&s;ts them&s;elves were in|debted
to the night.</P>
<P>BUT whence comes it that narratives of this
kind have at any time been given, by per|&s;ons
of veracity, of judgment, and of learning?
Men neither liable to be deceived them&s;elves,
<PB N="69" REF="73">
nor to be &s;u&s;pected of an inclination to deceive
others, though it were their intere&s;t; nor who
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any intere&s;t in it, even
though it were their inclination.</P>
<P>HERE &s;eem's a further explanation wanting than
what can be drawn from &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>I Go upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the relations
them&s;elves were fal&s;e. For as to the arguments
&s;ometimes u&s;ed in this ca&s;e, that had there been
no true &s;hilling there had been no counterfeit, it
&s;eems wholly a piece of &s;ophi&s;try. The true
&s;hilling here, &s;hould mean the living per&s;on; and
the counterfeit re&s;emblance, the po&s;thumous fi|gure
of him, that either &s;trikes our &s;en&s;es, or
our imagination.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING no gho&s;t then ever appeared, is it
a con&s;equence that no man could ever imagine
that they &s;aw the figure of a per&s;on decea&s;ed?
Surely tho&s;e, who &s;ay this, little know the force,
the caprice, or the defects of the imagination.</P>
<P>PERSONS after a deba$ch of liquor, or under
the influence of terror, or in the deliria of a fe|ver,
or in a fit of lunacy, or even walking in their
<PB N="70" REF="74">
&s;leep, have had their brain as deeply impre&s;&s;ed
with chimerical repre&s;entations, as they could
po&s;&s;ibly have been, had the&s;e repre&s;entations
&s;truck their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned but a few in&s;tances, where|in
the brain is primarily affected. Others may
be given, perhaps not quite &s;o common, where
the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, either acute or cronical,
have impre&s;&s;ed their object upon the brain; and
this in &s;o lively a manner, as to leave the vi&s;io|nary
no room to doubt of their real pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>How difficult then mu&s;t it be to undeceive a
per&s;on as to objects thus imprinted? Imprinted
ab&s;olutely with the &s;ame force as their eyes them|&s;elves
could have pourtrayed them! And how
many per&s;ons mu&s;t there needs be, who could
never be undeceived at all!</P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e cau&s;es might not improbably
have given ri&s;e to the notion of apparitions:
and when the notion had been once promul|gated,
it had a natural tendency to produce more
in&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75">
THE gloom of night, that was productive of
terror, would be naturally productive of appa|rations.
The event confirmed it.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ion of grief for a departed friend,
of horror for a murdered enemy, of remor&s;e for
a wronged te&s;tator, of love for a mi&s;tre&s;s killed
by incon&s;tancy, of gratitude to a wife for long
fidelity, of de&s;ire to be reconciled to one who
dyed at variance, of impatience to vindicate what
was fal&s;ely con&s;trued, of propen&s;ity to con&s;ult
with an advi&s;er, that is lo&s;t.&mdash;The more faint as
well as the more powerful pa&s;&s;ions, when bear|ing
relation to a per&s;on decea&s;ed, have often, I
fancy, with concurrent circum&s;tances, been &s;uffi|cient
to exhibit the dead to the living.</P>
<P>BUT, what is more, there &s;eems no other ac|count
that is adequate to the ca&s;e as I have &s;tat|ed
it. Allow this, and you have at once a rea&s;on,
why the mo&s;t upright may have publi&s;hed a fal&s;|hood,
and the mo&s;t judicious, confirmed an ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING then that apparitions of this kind
may have &s;ome real u&s;e in God's moral govern|ment:
<PB N="72" REF="76">
Is not any moral purpo&s;e, for which they
may be employed, as effectually an&s;wered on my
&s;uppo&s;ition, as the other? for &s;urely it cannot be
of any importance, by what means the brain re|ceives
the&s;e images. The effect, the conviction,
and the re&s;olution con&s;equent, may be ju&s;t the
&s;ame in either of the ca&s;es.</P>
<P>SUCH appears, to me at lea&s;t, to be the true
exi&s;tence of apparitions.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;ons again&s;t any external apparition,
among others that may be brought, are the&s;e
that follow.</P>
<P>THEY are, I think, never &s;een by day; and
darkne&s;s being the &s;ea&s;on of terror and uncer|tainty,
and the imagination le&s;s re&s;trained, they
are never vi&s;ible to more that one per&s;on:
which had more probably been the ca&s;e, were
not the vi&s;ion internal.</P>
<P>THEY have not been reported to have ap|peared
the&s;e twenty years. What cau&s;e can be
a&s;&s;igned, were their exi&s;tence real, for &s;o great a
change as their di&s;continuance?</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="77">
THE cau&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition has lo&s;t ground
for this la&s;t century; the notion of gho&s;ts has
been, together, exploded: A rea&s;on why the
imagination &s;hould be le&s;s prone to conceive
them; but not a rea&s;on why they them&s;elves
&s;hould cea&s;e.</P>
<P>MOST of tho&s;e, who relate that the&s;e &s;pec|tres
have appeared to them, have been per&s;ons
either dceply &s;uper&s;titious in other re&s;pects;
of enthu&s;ia&s;tick imaginations, of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions
which are the con&s;equence; or el&s;e have al|lowedly
felt &s;ome perturbation at the time.</P>
<P>SOME few in&s;tances may be &s;uppo&s;ed, where
the caprice of imagination, &s;o very remarkable
in dreams, may have pre&s;ented fanta&s;ms to tho&s;e
that waked. I believe there are few but can
recollect &s;ome, wherein it has wrought mi&s;takes
at lea&s;t equal to that of a white-hor&s;e for a wind|ing

<P>To conclude. As my hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;es
the chimera to give terror equal to the reality,
our be&s;t means of avoiding it, is to keep a

with a kind of triumph; not con&s;idering that vice

<P>CLELIA was born in England, of Romi&s;h pa|rents,
about the time of the revolution. She
&s;eemed naturally framed for love, if you were
to judge by her external beauties; but if you
build your opinion on her outward conduct, you
would have deemed her as naturally aver&s;e to
it. Numerous were the gar$cons of the polite
and gallant nation, who endeavoured to over|come
her prejudices, and to reconcile her man|ners
to her form. Per&s;ons of rank, fortune,
learning, wit, youth, and beauty &s;ued to her;
nor had &s;he any rea&s;on to quarrel with love for
the &s;hapes in which he appeared before her.
Yet in vain were all applications. Religion was her
only object; and &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved to pa&s;s her
days in all the au&s;terities of the mo&s;t rigid con|vent.
To this purpo&s;e &s;he &s;ought out an abbe&s;s
that pre&s;ided over a nunnery in Languedoc, a
&s;mall community, particularly remarkable for
<PB N="81" REF="85">
extraordinary in&s;tances of &s;elf-denial. The ab|be&s;s
her&s;elf exhibited a per&s;on in which cha&s;ti|ty
appeared indeed not very meritorious. Her
character was perfectly well known before &s;he
went to pre&s;ide over this little &s;ociety. Her
virtues were indeed &s;uch as &s;he thought mo&s;t
convenient to her circum&s;tances. Her fa&s;ts
were the effect of avarice, and her devotions of
the &s;pleen. She con&s;idered the cheapne&s;s of
hou&s;e-keeping, as the great reward of piety,
and added profu&s;ene&s;s to the &s;even deadly &s;ins.
She knew &s;ack-cloth to be cheaper than brocade,
and a&s;hes, than &s;weet powder.</P>
<P>HER heart &s;ympathized with every cup that
was broken, and &s;he in&s;tituted a fa&s;t for each
dome&s;tick misfortune. She had converted her
larder into a &s;tudy, and the greater part of her
library con&s;i&s;ted of manuals for fa&s;ting-days.
By the&s;e arts, and this way of life, &s;he &s;eemed to
enjoy as great a freedom from inordinate de|&s;ires,
as the per&s;ons might be &s;uppo&s;ed to do
who were favored with her &s;miles, or her con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>To this lady was Clelia admitted, and, after the
year of probation a&s;&s;umed the veil.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="86">
AMONG many others who had &s;olicited he$
notice, before &s;he became a member of this
convent, was Leander, a young phy&s;ician of great
learning and ingenuity. His per&s;onal accom|pli&s;hments
were at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of any of
his rivals, and his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uperior. He urged
in his behalf all that wit, in&s;pired by fondne&s;s,
and recommended by per&s;on, dre&s;s, and equipage,
could in&s;inuate; but in vain. She grew angry
at &s;ollicitations with which &s;he re&s;olved never to
comply, and which &s;he found &s;o difficult to
cvade.</P>
<P>BUT Clelia now had a&s;&s;umed the veil, and
Leander was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of mortals. He
had not &s;o high an opinion of his fair one's &s;anctity
and zeal, as &s;ome other of her admirers: But he
had a conviction of her beauty, and that alto|gether
irre&s;i&s;tible. His extravagant pa&s;&s;ion had
produced in him a jealou&s;y that was not ea&s;ily
eluded.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;At regina dolos&mdash;</L>
<L>Quid non &s;entit amor?&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="83" REF="87">
HE had ob&s;erved his mi&s;tre&s;s go more frequent|ly
to her confe&s;&s;or, a young and blooming eccle|&s;ia&s;tic,
than was, perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o much
apparent purity, or, as he thought, con&s;i&s;tent
with it. It was enough to put a lover on the
rack, and if had this effect upon Leander. His
&s;u&s;picions were by no means le&s;&s;ened, when he
found the convent to which Clelia had given the
preference before all others, was one where this
young friar &s;upplied a confe&s;&s;ional chair.</P>
<P>IT happened that Leander was brought to
the abbe&s;s in the capacity of a phy&s;ician, and
he had one more opportunity offered him of be|holding
Clelia through the grate.</P>
<P>SHE, quite &s;hocked at his appearance, bur&s;t
out into a &s;udden rage, inveighing bitterly again&s;t
his pre&s;umption, and calling loudly on the name
of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin and the holy friar. The
convent was, in &s;hort, alarmed; nor was Clelia
capable of being pacified till the good man was
called, in order to allay, by &s;uitable applications,
the emotions rai&s;ed by this unexpected inter|view.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="88">
LEANDER grew daily more convinced, that it
was not only verbal communications which pa&s;&s;ed
between Clelia and the friar. This, however,
he did not think him&s;elf fully warranted to
di&s;clo&s;e, till an accident, of a &s;ingular nature,
gave him an opportunity of receiving more ample
te&s;timony.</P>
<P>THE confe&s;&s;or had a favorite &s;paniel, which
he had lo&s;t for &s;ome time, and was informed at
length that he was killed, at a village in the neigh|bourhood,
being evidently mad. The friar was
at fir&s;t not much concerned; but in a little time
recollected that the dog had &s;napped his fingers
the very day before his elopement. A phy&s;ician's
advice was thought expedient on the occa&s;ion,
and Leander was the next phy&s;ician. He told
him with great frankne&s;s, that no pre&s;cription
he could write, had the &s;anction of &s;o much ex|perience
as immer&s;ion in &s;ea-water. The friar,
therefore, the next day &s;et forward upon his jour|ney,
while Leander, not without a mi&s;chievous
kind of &s;atisfaction, conveys the following lines
to Clelia.</P>
<LETTER>

with greater innocence, have granted to Le|ander.
All I have to add is this, that a|morous

</LETTER>
<P>IMAGINE Clelia guilty, and then imagine her
confu&s;ion. To rail was in&s;ignificant, and to blame
her phy&s;ician was ab&s;urd, when &s;he found her&s;elf
under a nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing his advice. The
whole &s;ociety was made acquainted with the jour|ney
&s;he was undertaking, and the cau&s;es of
it. It were uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e the whole
community under the &s;ame con&s;traint with the
unhappy Clelia. However, the greater part
thought it decent to attend her. Some went as
her companions, &s;ome for exerci&s;e, &s;ome for
amu&s;ement, and the abbe&s;s her&s;elf as guardian
<PB N="86" REF="90">
of her train, and concerned in her &s;ociety's mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>WHAT u&s;e Leander made of his di&s;covery is

<HEAD>ON VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY pre&s;erves the memory of em|pires
and of &s;tates, with which it nece&s;|&s;arily
interweaves that of heroes, kings, and
&s;tate&s;men. Biography affords a place to the
remarkable characters of private men. There
are likewi&s;e other &s;ubordinate te&s;timonies,
which &s;erve to perpetuate, at lea&s;t prolong,
the memories of men, who&s;e characters and
&s;tations give them no claim to a place in &s;tory.
For in&s;tance, when a per&s;on fails of making that
figure in the world, which he makes in the eyes,
of his own relations or him&s;elf, he is rarely dig|nified
any farther than with his picture whil&s;t he
is living, or with an in&s;cription upon his monu|ment
after his decea&s;e. In&s;criptions have been
&s;o fallacious, that we begin to expect little from
them be&s;ide elegance of &s;tyle. To inveigh again&s;t
the writers, for their manife&s;t want of truth, were
as ab&s;urd as to cen&s;ure Homer for the beauties
of an imaginary character&mdash;But even paintings,
in order to gratify the vanity of the per&s;on who
be&s;peaks them, are taught now-a-days, to flatter
like epitaphs.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="92">
FALSEHOODS upon a tomb or monument may
be intitled to &s;ome excu&s;e in the affection, the gra|titude,
and piety, of &s;urviving friends. Even
grief it&s;elf di&s;po&s;es us to magnify the virtues of
a relation, as vi&s;ible objects al&s;o appear larger
through tears. But the man who through an idle
vanity &s;uffers his features to be bely'd or ex|changed
for others of a more agreeable make,
may with great truth be &s;aid to lo&s;e his property
in the portrait. In like manner, if he encourage
the painter to bely his dre&s;s, he &s;eems to trans|fer
his claim to the man with who&s;e &s;tation his
a&s;&s;umed trappings are connected.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a bag-piper, who&s;e phy&s;iognomy
was &s;o remarkable and familiar to a club he at|tended,
that it was agreed to have his picture
placed over their chimney-piece. There was
this remarkable in the fellow, that he cho&s;e al|ways
to go barefoot, though he was daily offered
a pair of &s;hoes. However, when the painter had
been &s;o exact as to omit this little piece of dre&s;s,
the fellow offered all he had in the world, the
whole produce of three night's harmony, to
have tho&s;e feet covered in the effigie, which he
&s;o much &s;corned to cover in the original. Per|haps
he thought it a di&s;grace to his in&s;trument
<PB N="89" REF="93">
to be eternized in the hands of &s;o much appa|rent
poverty. However, when a per&s;on of low
&s;tation adorns him&s;elf with trophies to which he
has no preten&s;ions to a&s;pire, he &s;hould con&s;ider
the picture as actually telling a lye to po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;urdity of this is evident, if a per&s;on
a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf a mitre, a blue garter, or a
coronet, improperly; but &s;tation may be fal&s;e|fied
by other decorations, as well as the&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT I am driven into this grave di&s;cour&s;e, on
a &s;ubject, perhaps, not very important, by a real
fit of &s;pleen. I this morning &s;aw a fellow drawn
in a night-gown of &s;o rich a &s;tuff, that the ex|pence,
had he purcha&s;ed &s;uch a one, would more
than half have ruined him; and another cox|comb,
&s;eated by his painter in a velvet chair,
who would have been &s;urprized at the deference
paid him, had he been offered a cu&s;hion.</P>

<P>IT is a very convenient piece of knowledge
for a per&s;on upon a journey, to know the com|pellations
with which it is proper to addre&s;s tho&s;e

here may be of u&s;e to him who would be well
directed either in the length or the tendency of his
road; or be freed from any itinerary difficulties
incident to tho&s;e who do not know the country.
It may not be indeed imprudent to acco&s;t a pa&s;|&s;enger
with a title &s;uperior to what he may ap|pear
to claim. This will &s;eldom fail to diffu&s;e a
wonderful alacrity in his countenance; and be,
perhaps, a method of &s;ecuring you from any
mi&s;take of greater importance.</P>
<P>I WAS led into the&s;e ob&s;ervations by &s;ome &s;ol|licitudes
I lately underwent, on account of my
ignorance in the&s;e peculiarities. Being &s;ome|what
more ver&s;ed in books, than I can pretend
to be in the orders of men, it was my fortune
to undertake a journey, which I was to perform
by means of enquiries. I had pa&s;&s;ed a number
of miles without any &s;ort of difficulty, by help
of the manifold in&s;tructions that had been given
me on my &s;etting out. At length being &s;ome|thing
dubious concerning my way, I met a per|&s;on,
whom, from his nightcap and &s;everal dome&s;tic
parts of dre&s;s, I deemed to be of the neigh|bourhood.
His &s;tation of life appeared to me,
to be, what we call a genleman-farmer; a &s;ort of
&s;ubaltern character; in re&s;pect of which, the
<PB N="91" REF="95">
world &s;eems not invariably determined. It is in
&s;hort what King Charles the Second e&s;teemed the
happie&s;t of all &s;tations; &s;uperior to the toil&s;om
ta&s;k and ridiculous dignity of con&s;table; and as
much inferior to the intricate practice and invi|dious
deci&s;ions of a ju&s;tice of peace. &startq; Hone&s;t
man,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;be &s;o good as to inform me whe|ther
I am in the way to Mirlington?&endq; He repli|ed,
with a &s;ort of &s;urline&s;s, that he knew nothing
of the matter; and turned away with as much
di&s;gu&s;t, as though I had called him rogue or
ra&s;cal.</P>
<P>I DID not readily penetrate the cau&s;e of his
di&s;plea&s;ure, but proceeded on my way with
hopes, to find other means of information. The
next I met was a young fellow, dre&s;&s;ed in all the
pride of rural &s;prucene&s;s; and, be&s;ide him, walk|ed
a girl in a dre&s;s agreeable to that of her
companion. As I pre&s;umed him by no means
aver&s;e to appear con&s;iderable in the eyes of his
mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;ed a compliment might not be
di&s;agreeable; and enquiring the road to Mirling|ton,
addre&s;&s;ed him by the name of &startq; Hone&s;ty.&endq;
The fellow, whether to &s;hew his wit before his
mi&s;tre&s;s, or whether he was di&s;plea&s;ed with my
familiarity, I cannot tell, directed me to follow a
part of my face (which I was well a&s;&s;ured could
<PB N="92" REF="96">
be no guide to me) and that other parts would
follow of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE next I met, appeared, by his look and
gait, to &s;tand high in his own opinion. I there|fore
judged the be&s;t way of proceeding was to
adapt my phra&s;e to his own ideas, and &s;aluting
him by the name of Sir, de&s;ired to obtain &s;ome
in&s;ight into my road. My gentleman, without
he&s;itation, gave me ample in&s;tructions for the
re&s;t of my journey.</P>
<P>I PASSED on, mu&s;ing with my&s;elf, why an ap|pellation
relative to fortune &s;hould be preferred
to one founded on merit; when I happened to
behold a gentleman examining a &s;un-dial in his
garden. &startq; Friend,&endq; &s;ays I, &startq;will you tell me
what a clock it is?&endq; He made me no &s;ort of
an&s;wer, and &s;eemed as much di&s;&s;atisfied with my
openne&s;s of temper, as with the confidence I
placed in his&mdash;The refu&s;al of an an&s;wer in
this ca&s;e, was not of much importance. I pro|ceeded
on my way, and happened to meet a very
old woman, whom I determined to acco&s;t by the
appellation of Dame; and withal wi&s;hed her a
good night.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="97">
BUT, alas! &s;he &s;eemed &s;o little plea&s;ed with
the manner of my addre&s;s, that &s;he returned
me no manner of thanks for my kind wi&s;hes
as to her repo&s;e. It is not clear whether my
phra&s;e was faulty, in regard to her dignity, or
in re&s;pect of her age. But it is very probable
&s;he might conclude it an impropriety in re&s;pect
of both.</P>
<P>I HAD by this time found the inconvenience
of an utter ignorance in rural di&s;tinctions. The
future part of my journey afforded me yet
further means of conviction. I was expo&s;ed to
the danger of three quick&s;ands, by calling a
girl &startq;&s;weetheart&endq;, in&s;tead of madam; and was
within a foot of ru&s;hing down a precipice, by
calling another, &startq;For&s;ooth,&endq; who might ea&s;ily
have told me how to avoid it.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, I found my&s;elf well or ill u&s;ed, as
I happened, or not, to &s;uit my &s;alutations to
people's ideas of their own rank. Towards the
la&s;t part of my &s;tage, I was to pa&s;s a brook,
&s;o much &s;welled by land-floods, that the proper
way through it was undi&s;tingui&s;hable. A well|dre&s;&s;ed
gentleman was pa&s;&s;ing a bridge on my
<PB N="94" REF="98">
left-hand. It was here of much importance for
me to &s;ucceed in my enquiry. I was, therefore,
meditating within my&s;elf which might be the
mo&s;t endearing of all appellations; and at la&s;t
be&s;ought him to give me &s;ome in&s;tructions, under
the name of &startq;Hone&s;t Friend.&endq; He was not
&s;eemingly &s;o much plea&s;ed, as I a&s;&s;ured my&s;elf
he would be, and trudged onward without re|ply.
After this, I had not gone many &s;teps (out
of the path, for &s;o it proved) before I found my|&s;elf
and hor&s;e plunged headlong in the brook&punc;
and my late hone&s;t friend in a laughter at our
downfall.</P>
<P>I MADE a &s;hift, however, to recover both my|&s;elf
and hor&s;e, and, after a few more difficulties,
arrived at the end of my journey. I have &s;ince
made &s;trict enquiry into the due application of
&s;uch inferior titles, and may, perhaps, commu|nicate
them to you, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion. In
the mean time, you may, if you plea&s;e, con&s;ider
the va&s;t importance of &s;uperior titles, when there
is no one &s;o incon&s;iderable, but there is al&s;o a
mind that it can influence.</P>
<P>WHEN you reflect upon this &s;ubject, you will,
perhaps, be le&s;s &s;evere on your friend&mdash;

<P>LEARN to be wi&s;e then from others harm,

<HEAD>ON MODESTY AND
IMPUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man of genius does not print,
he di&s;covers him&s;elf by nothing more
than by his abilities in di&s;pute. However let
him &s;hew &s;olidity in his opinions, together with
ea&s;e, elegance, and vivacity in his expre&s;&s;ions,
yet if an impudent face be found to baffle him,
he &s;hall be judged inferior in other re&s;pects. I
mean he will grow cheap in mixed company: for
as to &s;elect judges, they will form their opinions
by another &s;cale: with the&s;e, a &s;ingle epi&s;tle,
penned with propriety, will more effectually prove
his wit, than an hundred defects in his conver&s;a|tion
will demon&s;trate the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis true there is nothing di&s;plays a genius, I
mean a quickne&s;s of genius, more than a di&s;pute;
as two diamonds, encountering, contribute to each
other's lu&s;tre. But perhaps the odds is much a|gain&s;t
the man of ta&s;te in this particular.</P>
<P>BASHFULNESS is more frequently connected
with good &s;en&s;e, than we find a&s;&s;urance: and
<PB N="97" REF="101">
impudence, on the other hand, is often the mere
effect of downright &s;tupidity. On this account
the man of genius has as much the advantage of
his antagoni&s;t, as a race-hor&s;e, carrying a &s;mall
weight, has over his rival that bears a larger:
mode&s;ty, like the weight to which I allude, not
&s;uffering its owner to exert his real &s;trength;
which effrontery is allowed to do, without lett or
impediment.</P>
<P>IT may be urged, and ju&s;tly enough, that 'tis
common to be partial to the mode&s;t man; and
that diffidence makes good amends for any re|&s;traint
it lays us under, by the prejudice it gives
every hearer in our favour. But indeed this can
only happen, where it meets with the mo&s;t inge|nuous
judges. Otherwi&s;e a laugh will carry the
day, with which the ignorant &s;ide is generally
be&s;t accommodated.</P>
<P>IN order to put the&s;e antagoni&s;ts upon a &s;ome|what
more equal footing, I have invented the fol|lowing
in&s;trument; for the &s;ole &s;tructure and &s;ale
of which, I am not without hopes of procuring
a patent. What I mean, is an artificial laughter.
There are few &s;o little conver&s;ant in toys, but
mu&s;t have &s;een in&s;truments mechanically framed
to counterfeit the voices of different birds. The
<PB N="98" REF="102">
quail-pipe is brought to &s;uch perfection as even
to delude the very &s;pecies. The cuckow has
been mimicked with no le&s;s accuracy. Would it
not then be an ea&s;y matter to repre&s;ent the laugh
of this empty tribe, which has in it&s;elf &s;ome|thing
artificial; and is not more affected than it
is particular. For the convenience of the per&s;on;
that bears it, it's dimen&s;ions &s;hould be &s;o contriv|ed
as that it might be played on in his pocket.
Does it not &s;eem fea&s;ible, that a laughter of this
kind may be brought to an&s;wer every pmrpo&s;e of
that noi&s;e which it re&s;embles? If there be occa|&s;ion
for an expletive, let the owner &s;eek it in his
fobb; as his antagoni&s;t would find his account in
a loud oath or an empty, pun. If there be need
of a good &s;ounding cadence at the clo&s;e of a
common period, it may not be ami&s;s to harmonize
a &s;entence by what may be called a fini&s;hing|&s;troke.
This in&s;trument is &s;o contrived as to pro|duce
all the variety of an human laugh; and
this variation is to be regulated, not by the na|ture

ONE or two of the&s;e in&s;truments I have al|ready
fini&s;hed, though not indeed to the perfec|tion,
at which I expect they may &s;oon arrive. A
gentleman vi&s;ited me t'other day who has the
ju&s;te&s;t claim that can be, to the u&s;e of them;
having nothing in his character that can ob&s;cure
the greate&s;t merit, but the greate&s;t mode&s;t. I
communicated my invention, de&s;iring him to make
tryal of it, on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. He did &s;o, and
when I &s;aw him next, gave me leave to publi&s;h
the following account of it's efficacy in my next
adverti&s;ement. The fir&s;t time I employed it, &s;aid
my friend, was in a &s;ort of controver&s;y with a
beau; who had contrived means by the u&s;e of
his &s;nuff-box, to &s;upply both want of language and
of thought. In this manner he prolonged his
argument; and really to the company, which
con&s;i&s;ted of ladies, di&s;covered more &s;agacity with|out
thinking, than I could do by it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
I bethought my&s;elf immediately of your in&s;tru|ment,
and had recour&s;e to it. I ob&s;erved in what
part of his di&s;cour&s;e he mo&s;t employed his fin|gers,
and had &s;uddenly recour&s;e to mine, with
equal empha&s;is, and &s;ignificancy. The art was
not di&s;covered, ere I had routed my antagoni&s;t;
having &s;eated my&s;elf in a dark corner, where my
operations were not di&s;cernible. I ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="100" REF="104">
as he found him&s;elf more clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, he grew
more and more a&s;&s;iduous in his application to his
&s;nuff-box, much as an otter clo&s;ely pur&s;ued is forc|ed
to throw up bubbles that &s;how his di&s;tre&s;s. I
therefore di&s;covered gradually le&s;s and le&s;s occa|&s;ion
for &s;peaking; and for thinking, none at all.
I played only a flouri&s;h in an&s;wer to the argu|ment
at his finger's ends; and after a while found
him as mortal in this part as in any other. When
his cau&s;e was ju&s;t expiring, after a very long pur|&s;uit,
and many fruitle&s;s turnings and eva&s;ions in
the cour&s;e of it, I &s;ounded$ my in&s;trument with as
much alacrity, as a hunt&s;man does his horn on the
death of an hare.</P>
<P>THE next whom I engaged was a more formi|dable
di&s;putant; and I own with a &s;en&s;e of gra|titude
that your in&s;trument alone could render me
a match for him. His &s;trength of argument was
his &s;trength of lungs; and he was, unque&s;tion|ably,
an able antagoni&s;t. However, if your ma|chine
put me upon a par with him, I think I may
&s;ay without vanity, that in point of rea&s;on, I had
the upper hand. I &s;hall only add that as it was
habitual for him to an&s;wer arguments by voci|feration,
&s;o it became needle&s;s for me to give,
him any an&s;wer of a better kind.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="105">
THUS far my friend: I do not que&s;tion but
there will appear arti&s;ts, that &s;hall undertake to
in&s;truct the diffident, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and the ba&s;h|full,
how to perform the whole gamut of orato|rical
and ri&s;ible mu&s;ick: and as there is a kind
of humorous laughter, which draws all others
into it's own vortex, I need not here a&s;&s;ert that I
would have this branch very much inculcated.</P>
<P>NEITHER is this in&s;trument of importance in
di&s;pute alone, or controver&s;y; but wherever one
man's faculties are more prone to laughter than
another's. Trifles will bur&s;t one man's &s;ides,
which will not di&s;turb the features of another;
and a laugh one cannot join, is almo&s;t as irk&s;ome
as a lamentation. 'Tis like a peal rung after a
wedding; where a whole pari&s;h &s;hall be &s;tun|ned
with noi&s;e, becau&s;e they want that occa&s;ion
to rejoice, which the per&s;ons at lea&s;t imagine to
be their lot, that occa&s;ioned it. The &s;ounds are
plea&s;ing to their ears, who find them conformable
to their own ideas; but tho&s;e who are not in tem|per,
or unconcerned, find them a &s;tupefying re|petition.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="106">
WHEN therefore my mind is not in tune with
another's, what &s;trikes his, will not vibrate on
mine. All I then have to do, is to counterfeit a
laugh; which is an operation as artificial, as the
machine I have been de&s;cribing,</P>
<P>THE actions of our lives, even tho&s;e we call
mo&s;t important, &s;eem as much &s;ubject to trifles, as
our very lives them&s;elves. We frame many not|able
projects in imagination, and promi&s;e to, our|&s;elves
an equal term of life. Tis however in the
power of the minute&s;t accident, to &s;horten the
one, and di&s;concert the other. 'Tis with mankind
as with certain fire-engines, who&s;e motion may be
&s;topped in the mid&s;t of it's rapidity, by the inter
po&s;ition of &s;traw in a particular part of them.</P>
<P>THE following tran&s;lation from the original
Spani&s;h, will &s;ufficiently illu&s;trate the foregoing
affertion. Don Pedro **** was one of the
principal grandees of his age and country. He
had a genius equal to his birth, and a di&s;po&s;ition
remarkably contemplative. 'Twas his cu&s;tom, on,
this account, to retire from the world at &s;tated
periods, and to indulge him&s;elf in all the mazes
of a fine imagination. It happened as he one
<PB N="103" REF="107">
day &s;ate in his &s;tudy, that he fixed his eye on a
neighbouring &s;pider. The mo&s;t trivial object,
(if any natural object can be termed &s;o) &s;erved
him frequently for the foundation of &s;ome mo|ral
and &s;ublime reflection. He &s;urveyed the crea|ture
attentively, and indulged the bias of his
thought, 'till he was lo&s;t in the excur&s;ions of a
profound reverie. The curious workman&s;hip of
this unregarded animal brought at once into his
mind the whole art of fortification. He ob&s;erv|ed
the deficiency of human &s;kill, and that no
cunning could have contrived her &s;o proper an
habitation. He found that no violence could af|fect
the extremities of her lines, but what was im|mediately
perceptible, and liable to alarm her at the
center. He ob&s;erved the road by which &s;he &s;al|ly'd
forth, &s;erved to convey intelligence from
without, at the &s;ame time that it added &s;trength,
and &s;tability to the work within. He was at
once &s;urprized and plea&s;ed, with an object which,
although common, he happened not to have be|held
in the &s;ame light, or with the &s;ame attenti|on.
From this in&s;tant he bent his thoughts upon,
the advancement of military fortification: And he
often would declare it was this trivial incident,
that gave him a reli&s;h for that &s;tudy, which he
afterwards pur&s;ued with &s;uch application, and
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="108">
HE &s;pent in &s;hort &s;o much time upon the at|tainment
of this &s;cience, that he grew as capable
of executing any part of it, as &s;peculation alone
could render him. Nothing wanted now, but
practice, to compleat the &s;ame of his abilities.
That in &s;hort was his next pur&s;uit. He became
de&s;irous of experiencing, what had been &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful
in imagination, and to make tho&s;e mural
&s;allies, which had been attended there with vic|tory.
To this end he had little to do, but excite
the ambition of his young monarch; to enforce
by te&s;timony of his friends his qualifications for
the po&s;t he &s;ought; and, on the fir&s;t delivery of
his petition to obtain preferment from the king.</P>
<P>THIS happened to be a time of the profound|e&s;t
tranquillity: little agreeable to a per&s;on eager
of glory, furni&s;hed with &s;kill and con&s;cious of a|bilities.
Such was this ingenious noblemen. He
well knew the ambition of princes, and of his
monarch in particular. But he was not acquaint|ed
with his own. That imperious and &s;ubtle
pa&s;&s;ion, is often mo&s;t predominant when 'tis lea&s;t
perceived. When it once prevails in any great
degree, we find our rea&s;on grow &s;ub&s;ervient,
and, in&s;tead of checking or contradicting, it &s;toops
to flatter, and to authorize it, In&s;tead of unde|ceiving,

&s;he confirms us in our error; and even
levels the mounds and &s;mooths the ob&s;tructions,
which it is her natural province to interpo&s;e. This
was the ca&s;e of Don Pedro. The delicacy of his ta&s;te
encrea&s;ed his &s;en&s;ibility; and his &s;en&s;ibility made him
more a &s;lave. The mind of man, like the finer parts
of matter, the more delicate it is, naturally admits the
more deep and the more vi&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions. The
pure&s;t &s;pirits are the &s;oone&s;t apt to take the flame.
Let us therefore be the more candid to him, on ac|count
of the vivacity of his pa&s;&s;ions, &s;educed, as
indeed he was, into very unwarrantable &s;chemes.</P>
<P>HE had in brief conceived a project, to give
his ma&s;ter an univer&s;al monarchy, He had cal|culated
every article, with the utmo&s;t labour and
preci&s;ion, and intended within a few days, to pre|&s;ent
his project to the king.</P>
<P>SPAIN was then in a &s;tate of affluence; had a
large army on foot; together with means and op|portunities
of rai&s;ing an immen&s;e one. 'Twere
impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer for the po&s;&s;ible events, that
might de&s;troy their hopes of &s;uch an enter|prize.
Difficulty often attends the execution of
things the mo&s;t fea&s;ible and well contrived in the|ory.
But whoever was acquainted with the au|thor
of this project, knew the po&s;ture of affairs
<PB N="106" REF="110">
in Europe at that time, the ambition of the prince,
and the many circum&s;tances that con&s;pired to fa|vour
it, might have thought the project would
have been agreed to, put in practice, and, with|out
&s;ome particular interpo&s;ition of fortune, been
attended with &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;But fortune did not put
her&s;eif to any particular trouble about the
matter.</P>
<P>DON Pedro, big with va&s;t de&s;igns, was one day
walking in his fields. He was promi&s;ed the next
morning an audience of the king. He was pre|paring
him&s;elf for a conver&s;ation, which might
prove of &s;o much con&s;equence to all mankind;
when walking thoughtfully along and regardle&s;s
of his path, his foot happened to &s;tumble and to
overturn an ant's-ne&s;t. He ca&s;t his eyes upon
the ground to &s;ee the occa&s;ion of his mi&s;take,
where he &s;pyed the little animals in the mo&s;t
mi&s;erable confu&s;ion. He had the delicacy of
&s;entiment, to be really &s;orry for what he had
done; and, putting him&s;elf in their condition,
began to reflect upon the con&s;equence. It might
be an age, to them, ere they could recover their
tranquillity. He viewed them with a &s;ort of &s;mile
to find the anxiety they underwent for &s;uch pe|ri&s;hable
habitations. Yet he con&s;idered that his
<PB N="107" REF="111">
contempt was only the effect of his own &s;uperi|ority;
and that there might be &s;ome created be|ings
to whom his own &s;pecies mu&s;t appear as tri|fling.
His remark did not cea&s;e here. He con|&s;idered
his future enterprize, with an eye to
&s;uch a race of beings. He found it mu&s;t appear
to them in a light as di&s;advantageous, as the am|bition
and vain-glory of an ant would, to him|&s;elf.
How ridiculous, he &s;aid, mu&s;t this repub|lick
appear to me, could I di&s;cern its actions, as
it has probably many, that are analogous to
tho&s;e of human nature. Suppo&s;e them at con|tinual
variance about the property of a grain of
&s;and. Suppo&s;e one, that had acquired a few
&s;ands more to his portion&mdash;as al&s;o one grain of
wheat, and one &s;mall particle of barley-flour,
&s;hould think him&s;elf qualified to tyrannize over
his equals and to lord it, uncontrolled. Con&s;ider
him, on this account, not contented to make u&s;e
of the numerous legs with which nature has &s;up|plied
him, born aloft by a couple of &s;laves with|in
the hollow of an hu&s;k of wheat, five or &s;ix
others, at the &s;ame time, attending &s;olemnly upon
the proce&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e la&s;tly that among this
people, the prime mini&s;ter &s;hould per&s;uade the
re&s;t to level war upon a neighbouring colony;
and this in order to be &s;tiled the &s;overeign of two
hillocks, in&s;tead of one; while perhaps their
<PB N="108" REF="112">
pre&s;ent condition leaves them nothing to wi&s;h
be&s;ide &s;uperfluities. At the &s;ame time it is in
the power of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable among man|kind,
nay of any &s;pecies of animals &s;uperior to
their own, to de&s;troy at once the mini&s;ter and
the people altogether; This is doubtle&s;s very ri|diculous,
yet this is doubtle&s;s my own ca&s;e; in
re&s;pect of many &s;ubordinate beings, and very
certainly of the &s;upreme one. Farewell then ye
air-built citadels! Farewell vi&s;ions of un-&s;olid
glory! Don Pedro will &s;eek no honour of &s;o e|quivocal
an acceptation, as to degrade his cha|racter
to a &s;uperior &s;pecies, in proportion as it
exalts him before his own.</P>
<P>SEE here a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion! In &s;hort, he found
it &s;o fairly drawn, as immediately to drop his
project, leave the army, and retire: of which
whim&s;ical relation it may be well enough ob&s;erv|ed,
that a &s;pider had en&s;laved the world had no$
an ant ob&s;tructed his de&s;ign.</P>

however in &s;ome mea&s;ure perhaps unavoidable
(and perhaps in &s;ome &s;en&s;e an u&s;eful) pa&s;&s;ion in
all the mo&s;t heroic natures; where, refined
through certain &s;trainers, it takes the name of
emulation. 'Tis a pain ari&s;ing in our brea&s;ts, on
contemplation of the &s;uperior advantages of ano|ther:
And its tendency is truly good, under &s;ome
certain regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="114">
ALL honour, very, evidently, depends upon
compari&s;on; and con&s;equently the more numerous
are our &s;uperiors, the &s;maller portion of it falls
to our &s;hare. Con&s;idered relatively, we are dwarfs,
or giants; though con&s;idered ab&s;olutely, we are
neither. However the love of this relative gran|deur,
is made a part of our natures; and the u&s;e
of emulation is to excite our diligence in pur&s;uit
of power, for the &s;ake of beneficence. The in|&s;tances
of it's perver&s;ion are obvious to every
one's ob&s;ervation. A vicious mind, in&s;tead of
it's own emolument, &s;tudies the deba&s;ement of

and in order to be beloved, di&s;cover no|thing

and &s;uffer his &s;atisfaction to ari&s;e in due propor|tion

to examine what others we have to ballance it.
We envy another man's bodily accompli&s;hments;

we put them into the &s;cale. Should we a&s;k our

white&s;t marble. I mu&s;t inform you, that within
this temple re&s;ides a lady<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Virtue.</NOTE>, weaving wreaths of
immortal amaranth for that worthy matron, if
&s;he exert her authority; and, as their obedience
is more or le&s;s entire, &s;he has al&s;o garlands of
inferior lu&s;tre to recompence the ladies in her
train.</P>
<P>YOUR own &s;agacity, added he, will &s;upply the
place of farther in&s;tructions, and then vani&s;hed
in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>THE &s;pace before me, as it appeared, was
cro&s;&s;ed by four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rivers. Over the&s;e
were thrown as many bridges, and beyond each
of the&s;e &s;treams the ground &s;eemed to vary it's
degree of lu&s;tre, as much as if it had lain under
<PB N="117" REF="121">
a different climate. On the &s;ide of each of the&s;e
rivers appeared, as I thought, a receptacle for
travellers; &s;o that the journey &s;eemed to be por|tioned
into four di&s;tinct &s;tages. It is po&s;&s;ible that
the&s;e were meant to repre&s;ent the periods of a
man's life; which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
names of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age.</P>
<P>DURING the fir&s;t &s;tage, our travellers pro|ceeded
without much di&s;turbance. Their excur|&s;ions
were of no greater extent than to crop a
primro&s;e, or a dai&s;y, that grew on the way-&s;ide:
And in the&s;e their governe&s;s indulged them. She
gave them but few checks, and they afforded her
but little occa&s;ion. But when they arrived at the
&s;econd period, the ca&s;e then was greatly altered.
The young ladies grew vi&s;ibly enamoured of the
beauties on each &s;ide; and the governe&s;s began
to feel a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her duty to re&s;train
them. They petitioned clamorou&s;ly to make one
&s;hort excur&s;ion, and met with a decent refu&s;al.
One of them, that vi&s;ibly &s;hewed her&s;elf the
greate&s;t vixen and romp<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> among&s;t them, had a
thou&s;and arts and &s;tratagems to circumvent her
well-meaning governe&s;s. I mu&s;t here mention,
what I remarked afterwards, that &s;ome of the

<PB N="118" REF="124">
pupils felt greater attractions in one &s;tage; and
&s;ome in another. And the &s;cene before them
being well variegated with mo&s;&s;y banks, and purl|ing
&s;treams, fri&s;king lambs, and piping &s;hepherds;
in&s;pired a longing that was inexpre&s;&s;ible, to one
that &s;eemed of an amorous complexion. She re|que&s;ted
to make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion; pointed to the
band of &s;hepherds dancing; and, as I ob&s;erved,
pre&s;ented a gla&s;s, through which the matron
might di&s;tinctly view them. The governe&s;s ap|plied
the gla&s;s, and it was wonderful to trace the
change it effected. She, who before had with
much con&s;tancy oppo&s;ed the prayers of the peti|tioner,
now began to lean towards her demands;
and, as if &s;he her&s;elf were not quite indifferent
to the &s;cene of plea&s;ure &s;he had beheld, grew
remi&s;s in her di&s;ipline; &s;oftened the language
of di&s;&s;ent; and with a gentle reprimand, &s;uffered
her pupil to elope. After this, however, &s;he
winked her eyes; that &s;he might not at lea&s;t bear
te&s;timony to the &s;tep &s;he did not approve. When
the lady had gratified her curio&s;ity, &s;he returned
for the pre&s;ent; but with an appetite more in|flamed,
and more impatient to repeat her frolick.
The governe&s;s appeared unea&s;y, and to repent
of her own compliance; and rea&s;on good &s;he
had; con&s;idering the confidence it gave her pupil,
and the weight it took from her own authority.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">
THEY were not pa&s;&s;ed far from the &s;econd
&s;tage of their journey, ere they all determined
to rebel, and &s;ubmit to the tyranny of their
leader no longer.</P>
<P>ANOTHER now took the lead; and &s;eizing an
embroidered handkerchief, compleatly hood|winked
the directre&s;s. All now was tumult,
anarchy, di&s;agreement, and confu&s;ion. They
led their guide along, blindfold, not without
propo&s;als of downright murder. They &s;oon lo&s;t
&s;ight of the regular path, and &s;trode along with
amazing rapidity I &s;hould, however, except
&s;ome few<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The virtuo&s;o-pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> who, being of a complexion naturally
languid, and thus deprived of their protectre&s;s,
had neither con&s;tancy to keep the road, nor &s;pirit
enough to &s;tray far from it. The&s;e found the
utmo&s;t of their inclination gratified, in trea&s;uring
up &s;hells from the banks of the river, &s;cooping
fo&s;&s;ils from the rocks, or pre&s;erving plants that
grew in the valley. A moth or butterfly afforded
them a chace, and a grub or beetle was a &s;uitable
companion. But to return to the vagabonds.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">
THE lady that performed the feat of blinding
her governe&s;s, for a time, bore the chief rule;
and held the re&s;t in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE>. She
&s;eemed to be indeed formed for that power and
grandeur, which was her delight; being of a &s;ta|&s;ture
remarkably tall, with an air of dignity in
her countenance. Not but others would &s;ome|times
in&s;i&s;t upon &s;ome temporary gratification.
As they &s;haped their way to a great city,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Indolence</NOTE> one
would loll and loiter on a bed of ro&s;es; another
would join the dance of &s;hepherds, and &s;ometimes
retire with<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gallantry</NOTE> one into the covert. A<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Avarice.</NOTE> third
would not move a &s;tep further, till &s;he had ga|thered
&s;ome ore that was wa&s;hed from the moun|tains.
When they entered the city, their di&s;&s;i|pation
was yet more ob&s;ervable.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ebriety.</NOTE> One intoxi|cated
her&s;elf with cordials;<NOTE N="&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pride and Vanity.</NOTE> another went in
que&s;t of lace and. equipage. The<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE> lady, how|ever,
at this time mo&s;t enterprizing, and who
(as I mentioned before) had given &s;uch a turn to
their affairs, di&s;covered a &s;trange fondne&s;s her&s;elf
for lawn and ermine, embroidered &s;tars, and
golden collars. However difficult it &s;eemed to
reach them, or how little nece&s;&s;ary &s;oever they
<PB N="121" REF="127">
&s;eemed to happine&s;s, the&s;e alone engaged her
attention; and to the&s;e alone her hopes a&s;pred.
Nay &s;he went &s;o far, as, in failure of the&s;e, to
re&s;olve on mi&s;ery and wilful wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE at length &s;ucceeded, at lea&s;t &s;o far, as
to find how little they enhanced her happine&s;s;
and her former compeers having ruined their
con&s;titutions, were once again de&s;irous to have
their queen reign over them. In &s;hort, their
loyalty regained the a&s;cendant; in&s;omuch, that
with one con&s;nt they removed the bandage from
her eyes, and vowed to obey her future di|rections.</P>
<P>SHE promi&s;ed to procure them all the happine&s;s
that was con&s;i&s;tent with their pre&s;ent &s;tate; and
advi&s;ed them all to follow her towards the path
they had for&s;aken.</P>
<P>OUR travellers, in a little time after this,
pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge that introduced them to
their clo&s;ing &s;tage. The &s;ubjects, very orderly,
repentant, and demi&s;&s;ive: The governe&s;s, more
rigid and imperious than ever. The former,
withered, decrepid, langui&s;hing; the latter, in
greater vigour, and more beautiful than before.
Time appeared to produce in her, a very oppo&s;ite
<PB N="122" REF="128">
effect to that it wrought in her companions. She
&s;eemed, indeed, no more that ea&s;y ductile crea|ture,
in&s;ulted and borne away by the whims of
her companions. She appeared more judicious
in the commands &s;he gave, and more rigorous in
the execution. In &s;hort, both her own activity,
and the &s;upine lethargy of tho&s;e whom &s;he con|ducted,
united to make way for her unlimited
authority. Now, indeed, a more limited rule
might have &s;ecured obedience, and maintained
a regularity. The ladies were but litttle &s;truck
with the glare of objects on each &s;ide the way.
One alone I mu&s;t except whom I beheld look
wi&s;hfully, with a retorted eye, towards the golden
ore wa&s;hed down by the torrents. The gover|ne&s;s
repre&s;ented, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that
the&s;e materials could not be imported into the
realms they were about to enter. That, were
this even the ca&s;e, they could be there of no im|portance.
However &s;he had not extirpated the
bia&s;s of this craving dame, when they approach|ed
the temple to which I formerly alluded.</P>
<P>THE temple &s;tood upon a lofty hill, half en|circled
with trees of never-fading verdure. Be|tween
the milk-white columns (which were of
the Dorick order, the ba&s;es gilt, as al&s;o the ca|pitals)
a blaze of glory i&s;&s;ued, of &s;uch &s;uperior
<PB N="123" REF="129">
lu&s;tre, that none be&s;ide the governe&s;s was able
to approach it. She, indeed, with a dejected
countenance, drew near unto the godde&s;s; who
gently waved her hand, in the way of &s;alutation.</P>
<P>THE matron &s;eemed le&s;s dazled, than delighted,
with her exce&s;&s;ive beauty. She acco&s;ted her
with reverence, and with much diffidence began
to mention their preten&s;ion to her favor. &startq;She
mu&s;t own, &s;he had been too remi&s;s in the be|ginning
of her government; &s;he hoped it would
be attributed to inexperience in the &s;ubtle wiles
of her fellow-travellers. She flattered her&s;elf,
that her &s;everity towards the conclu&s;ion of her
journey might in &s;ome &s;ort make attonement
for her misbehaviour in the beginning. La&s;tly,
that &s;he &s;ometimes found it impo&s;&s;ible to hear
the dictates of the Godde&s;s amid the clamours
of her pupils, and the din of their per&s;ua&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>To this the Godde&s;s made reply.</OPENER>
<P>&startq; You have heard, &s;aid &s;he, no doubt, that
the favors I be&s;tow, are by no means con&s;i&s;tent
with a &s;tate of inactivity. The only time when

them, was the time when your pupils were the

<HEAD>UNCONNECTED THOUGHTS
ON GARDENING.</HEAD>
<P>GARDENING may be divided into
three &s;pecies&mdash;kitchen-gardening&mdash;par|terre-gardening&mdash;and
land&s;kip, or picture&s;que|gardening:
which latter is the &s;ubject intended
in the following pages&mdash;It con&s;i&s;ts in plea&s;ing the
imagination by &s;cenes of grandeur, beauty, or
variety. Convenience merely has no &s;hare here;
any farther than as it plea&s;es the imagination.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the divi&s;ion of the plea&s;ures of ima|gination,
according as they are &s;truck by the
great, the various, and the beautiful, may be ac|curate
enough for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: why each
of them affects us with plea&s;ure may be traced
in other authors. See Burke, Hutchin&s;on, Ge|rard.
The theory of agreeable &s;en&s;ations, &amp;c<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">GARDEN-SCENES may perhaps be divided into the &s;u|blime, the beautifull, and the melancholy or pen&s;ive; to which la&s;t I know not but we may a&s;&s;ign a middle place betwixt the former two, as being in &s;ome &s;ort compo&s;ed of both. See Burke's &s;ublime, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="132">
THERE &s;eems however to be &s;ome objects
which afford a plea&s;ure not reducible to either of
the foregoing heads. A ruin, for in&s;tance, may
be neither new to us, nor maje&s;tick, nor beau|tiful,
yet afford that plea&s;ing melancholy which
proceeds from a reflexion on decayed magnifi|cence.
For this rea&s;on an able gardiner &s;hould
avail him&s;elf of objects, perhaps, not very &s;trik|ing;
if they &s;erve to connect ideas, that convey
reflexions of the plea&s;ing kind.</P>
<P>OBJECTS &s;hould indeed be le&s;s calculated to
&s;trike the immediate eye, than the judgment or
well-formed imagination; as in painting.</P>
<P>IT is no objection to the plea&s;ure of novelty,
that it makes an ugly object more di&s;agreeable.
It is enough that it produces a &s;uperiority be|twixt
things in other re&s;pects equal. It &s;eems,
on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to go even further. Are there
not broken rocks and rugged grounds, to which
we can hardly attribute either beauty or gran|deur,
and yet when introduced near an extent
of lawn, impart a plea&s;ure equal to more &s;hape|ly
&s;cenes? Thus a &s;eries of lawn, though ever
&s;o beautiful, may &s;atiate and cloy, unle&s;s the eye
<PB N="127" REF="133">
pa&s;&s;es to them from wilder &s;cenes; and then they
acquire the grace of novelty.</P>
<P>VARIETY appears to me to derive good part
of it's effect from novelty; as the eye, pa&s;&s;ing
from one form or color, to a form or color of a
different kind, finds a degree of novelty in it's
pre&s;ent object which affords immediate &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>VARIETY however, in &s;ome in&s;tances, may be
carried to &s;uch exce&s;s as to lo&s;e it's whole effect.
I have ob&s;erved ceilings &s;o crammed with &s;tucco|ornaments;
that, although of the mo&s;t different
kinds, they have produced an uniformity. A
&s;ufficient quantity of undecorated &s;pace is nece&s;|&s;ary
to exhibit &s;uch decorations to advantage.</P>
<P>GROUND &s;hould fir&s;t be con&s;idered with an
eye to it's peculiar character: whether it be the
grand, the &s;avage, the &s;prightly, the melancho|ly,
the horrid, or the beautifull. As one or
other of the&s;e characters prevail, one may &s;ome|what
&s;trengthen it's effect, by allowing every
part &s;ome denomination, and then &s;upporting it's
title by &s;uitable appendages&mdash;For in&s;tance, The
lover's walk may have a&s;&s;ignation &s;eats, with pro|per
<PB N="128" REF="134">
mottoes&mdash;Urns to faithfull lovers&mdash;Trophies,
garlands, &amp;c. by means of art.</P>
<P>WHAT an advantage mu&s;t &s;ome Italian &s;eats
derive from the circum&s;tance of being &s;ituate
on ground mentioned in the cla&s;&s;icks? And, even
in England, wherever a park or garden happens
to have been the &s;cene of any event in hi&s;tory,
one would &s;urely avail one's &s;elf of that circum|&s;tance,
to make it more intere&s;ting to the ima|gination.
Mottoes &s;hould allude to it, columns,
&amp;c. record it; ver&s;es moralize upon it; and cu|rio&s;ity
receive it's &s;hare of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN de&s;igning a hou&s;e and gardens, it is happy
when there is an opportunity of maintaining a
&s;ubordination of parts; the hou&s;e &s;o luckily
placed as to exhibit a view of the whole de&s;ign.
I have &s;ometimes thought that there was room
for it to re&s;emble an epick or dramatick poem.
It is rather to be wi&s;hed than required, that the
more &s;triking &s;cenes may &s;ucceed tho&s;e which are
le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te depends much upon temper. Some pre|fer
Tibullus to Virgil, and Virgil to Homer&mdash;Hagley
to Persfield, and Persfield to the Wel&s;h.
<PB N="129" REF="135">
mountains. This occa&s;ions the different prefer|ences
that are given to &s;ituations&mdash;A garden
&s;trikes us mo&s;t, where the grand, and the plea|&s;ing
&s;ucceed, not intermingle, with each other.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, however, the &s;ublime has general|ly
a deeper effect than the merely beautiful.</P>
<P>I USE the words land&s;kip and pro&s;pect, the for|mer
as expre&s;&s;ive of home &s;cenes, the latter of
di&s;tant images. Pro&s;pects &s;hould take in the blue
di&s;tant hills; but never &s;o remotely, that they be
not di&s;tingui&s;hable from clouds. Yet this mere
extent is what the vulgar value.</P>
<P>LAND SKIP &s;hould contain variety enough to
form a picture upon canvas; and this is no bad
te&s;t, as I think the land&s;kip painter is the gardi|ner's
be&s;t de&s;igner. The eye requires a &s;ort of
ballance here; but not &s;o as to encroach upon
probable nature. A wood, or hill, may ballance
a hou&s;e or obeli&s;k; for exactne&s;s would be di&s;|plea&s;ing.
We form our notions from what we
have &s;een; and though, could we comprehend the
univer&s;e, we might perhaps find it uniformly re|gular;
yet the portions that we &s;ee of it, habi|tuate
our fancy to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">
THE eye &s;hould always look rather down upon
water: Cu&s;tomary nature makes this requi&s;ite.
I know nothing more &s;en&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ing than
Mr. T&mdash;'s flat ground betwixt his terras and
his water.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to account for the fondne&s;s of
former times for &s;trait-lined avenues to their
hou&s;es; &s;trait-lined walks through their woods;
and, in &s;hort, every kind of &s;trait-line; where
the foot is to travel over, what the eye has done
before. This circum&s;tance, is One objection.
Another, &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind, is the re|petition
of the &s;ame object, tree after tree, for
a length of way together. A third is, that this
identity is purcha&s;ed by the lo&s;s of that variety,
which the natural country &s;upplies every where;
in a greater or le&s;s degree. To &s;tand &s;till and
&s;urvey &s;uch avenues, may afford &s;ome &s;lender
&s;atisfaction, through the change derived from
per&s;pective; but to move on continually and find
no change of &s;cene in the lea&s;t attendant on our
change of place, mu&s;t give actual pain to a per|&s;on
of ta&s;te. For &s;uch an one to be condemned
to pa&s;s along the famous vi&s;ta from<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Monte&s;quieu, on Ta&s;te.</NOTE> Mo&s;cow
to Petersburg, or that other from Agra to Lahor
<PB N="131" REF="137">
in India, mu&s;t be as di&s;agreeable a &s;entence, as
to be condemned to labour at the gallies. I
conceived &s;ome idea of the &s;en&s;ation he mu&s;t
feel, from walking but a few minutes, immured,
betwixt Lord D&mdash;'s high-&s;horn yew-hedges;
which run exactly parallel, at the di&s;tance of a|bout
ten feet; and are contrived perfectly to ex|clude
all kind of objects what&s;oever.</P>
<P>WHEN a building, or other object has been
once viewed from its proper point, the foot &s;hould
never travel to it by the &s;ame path, which the
eye has travelled over before. Lo&s;e the object,
and draw nigh, obliquely.</P>
<P>THE &s;ide-trees in vi&s;tas &s;hould be &s;o circum|&s;tanced
as to afford a probability that they grew
by nature.</P>
<P>RUINATED &s;tructures appear to derive their
power of plea&s;ing, from the irregularity of &s;ur|face,
which is VARIETY; and the latitude they
afford the imagination, to conceive an enlarge|ment
of their dimen&s;ions, or to recollect any
events or circum&s;tances appertaining to their pri&s;|tine
grandeur, &s;o far as concerns grandeur and
&s;olemnity. The breaks in them &s;hould be as
bold and abrupt as po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;If mere beauty be
<PB N="132" REF="138">
aimed at (which however is not their chief ex|cellence)
the waving line, with more ea&s;y tran&s;|itions,
will become of greater importance&mdash;Events
relating to them may be &s;imulated by numberle&s;s
little artifices; but it is ever to be remembered,
that high hills and &s;udden de&s;cents are mo&s;t
&s;uitable to ca&s;tles; and fertile vales, near wood
and water, mo&s;t imitative of the u&s;ual &s;ituation
for abbeys and religious hou&s;es; large oaks, in
particular, are e&s;&s;ential to the&s;e latter.</P>
<P><Q><L>Who&s;e branching arms, and reverend height</L>
<L>Admit a dim religious light.</L></Q>
A cottage is a plea&s;ing object partly on account
of the variety it may introduce; on account of
the tranquillity that &s;eems to reign there; and
perhaps, (I am &s;omewhat afraid) on account of
the pride of human nature.</P>
<Q>Longi alterius &s;pectare laborem.</Q>
<P>In a &s;cene pre&s;ented to the eye, objects &s;hould
never lie &s;o much to the right or left, as to give it
any unea&s;ine&s;s in the examination. Sometimes,
however, it may be better to admit valuable objects
even with this di&s;advantage. They &s;hould el&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="139">
never be &s;een beyond a certain angle. The eye
mu&s;t be ea&s;y, before it can be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>No mere &s;lope from one &s;ide to the other can
be agreeable ground: The eye requires a bal|lance&mdash;i. e.
a degree of uniformity: but this may
be otherwi&s;e effected and the rule &s;hould be un|der&s;tood
with &s;ome limitation.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Each alley has it's brother,</L>
<L>And half the plat-form ju&s;t reflects the other.</L></Q>
<P>LET US examine what may be &s;aid in favour
of that regularity which Mr. Pope expo&s;es.
Might he not &s;eemingly as well object to the
di&s;po&s;ition of an human face, becau&s;e it has an
eye or cheek, that is the very picture of it's
companion? Or does not providence who has
ob&s;erved this regularity in the external &s;tructure
of our bodies and di&s;regarded it within, &s;eem to
con&s;ider it as a beauty? The arms, the limbs,
and the &s;everal parts of them corre&s;pond, but
it is not the &s;ame ca&s;e with the thorax and the
abdomen. I believe one is generally &s;ollicitous
for a kind of ballance in a land&s;kip, and, if I am
not mi&s;taken, the painters generally furni&s;h one:
A building for in&s;tance on one &s;ide, contra&s;ted by
a group of trees, a large oak, or a ri&s;ing hill on
the other. Whence then does this ta&s;te proceed,
<PB N="134" REF="140">
but from the love we bear to regularity in per|fection?
After all, in regard to gardens, the
&s;hape of ground, the di&s;po&s;ition of trees, and
the figure of water, mu&s;t be &s;acred to nature;
and no forms mu&s;t be allowed that make a di&s;|covery
of art.</P>
<P>ALL trees have a character analogous to that
of men: Oaks are in all re&s;pects the perfect
image of the manly character: In farmer times
I &s;hould have &s;aid, and in pre&s;ent times I think
I am authorized to &s;ay, the Briti&s;h one. As a
brave man is not &s;uddenly either elated by pro&s;|perity,
or depre&s;&s;ed by adver&s;ity, &s;o the oak di&s;|plays
not it's verdure on the &s;un's fir&s;t approach;
nor drops it, on his fir&s;t departure. Add to this
it's maje&s;tic appearance, the rough grandeur of
of it's bark, and the wide protection of it's
branches.</P>
<P>A LARGE, branching, aged oak, is perhaps
the mo&s;t venerable of all inanimate objects.</P>
<P>URNS are more &s;olemn, if large and plain;
more beautiful, if le&s;s and ornamented. So|lemnity
is perhaps their point, and the &s;ituati|on
of them &s;hould &s;till cooperate with it.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141">
BY the way, I wonder that lead &s;tatues are
not more in vogue in our modern gardens.
Though they may not expre&s;s the finer lines of
an human body, yet they &s;eem perfectly well
calculated, on account of their duration, to em|belli&s;h
land&s;kips, were they &s;ome degrees infe|rior
to what we generally behold. A &s;tatue in
a room challenges examination, and is to be ex|amined
critically as a &s;tatue. A &s;tatue in a gar|den
is to be con&s;idered as one part of a &s;cene or
land&s;kip; the minuter touches are no more e&s;&s;en|tial
to it, than a good land&s;kip painter would
e&s;teem them were he to repre&s;ent a &s;tatue in his
picture.</P>
<P>APPARENT art, in it's proper province, is al|mo&s;t
as important as apparent nature. They
contra&s;t agreeably; but their provinces ever
&s;hould be kept di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>WHERE &s;ome artificial beauties are &s;o dexte|rou&s;ly
managed that one cannot but conceive
them natural, &s;ome natural ones &s;o extremely for|tunate
than one is ready to &s;wear they are arti|ficial.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="142">
CONCERNING &s;cenes, the more uncommon
they appear, the better, provided they form a
picture, and include nothing that pretends to be
of nature's production, and is not. The &s;hape of
of ground, the &s;ite of trees, and the fall of water,
nature's province. Whatever thwarts her is
trea&s;on.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, buildings and the works
of art, need have no other reference to nature
than that they afford the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> with which the
human mind is delighted.</P>
<P>ART &s;hould never be allowed to &s;et a foot in
the province of nature, otherwi&s;e than clande&s;|tinely
and by night. Whenever &s;he is allowed
to appear here, and men begin to compromi&s;e the
difference&mdash;Night, gothici&s;m, confu&s;ion and ab|&s;olute
chaos are come again.</P>
<P>To &s;ee one's urns, obeli&s;ks, and waterfalls
laid open; the nakedne&s;s of our beloved mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es,
the naiads, and the dryads, expo&s;ed by
that ruffian winter to univer&s;al ob&s;ervation; is a
&s;everity &s;carcely to be &s;upported by the help of
blazing hearths, chearful companions, and a bot|tle
of the mo&s;t grateful burgundy.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143">
THE works of a per&s;on that builds, begin im|mediately
to decay; while tho&s;e of him who
plants begin directly to improve. In this, plant|ing
promi&s;es a more la&s;ting plea&s;ure, than build|ing;
which, were it to remain in equal perfection,
would at be&s;t begin to moulder and want repairs
in imagination. Now trees have a circum&s;tance
that &s;uits our ta&s;te, and that is annual variety.
It is inconvenient indeed, if they cau&s;e our love
of life to take root and flouri&s;h with them;
whereas the very &s;amene&s;s of our &s;tructures will,
without the help of dilapidation, &s;erve to wean
us from our attachment to them.</P>
<P>IT is a cu&s;tom in &s;ome countries to condemn
the characters of tho&s;e (after death) that have
neither planted a tree, nor begat a child.</P>
<P>THE ta&s;te of the citizen and of the mere
pea&s;ant are in all re&s;pects the &s;ame. The for|mer
gilds his balls; paints his &s;tonework and
&s;tatues white; plants his trees in lines or cir|cles;
cuts his yew-trees four-&s;quare or conic;
or gives them, what he can, of the re&s;emblance
of birds, or bears, or men; &s;quirts up his rivu|let
in jetteaus; in &s;hort, admires no part of na|ture,
<PB N="138" REF="144">
but her ductility: exhibits every thing that
is glaring, that implies expence, or that effects a
&s;urprize becau&s;e it is unnatural. The pea&s;ant is
his admirer.</P>
<P>IT is always to be remembered in gardening
that &s;ublimity or magnificence, and beauty or
variety, are very different things. Every &s;cene
we &s;ee in nature is either tame and in&s;ipid; or
compounded of tho&s;e. It often happens that
the &s;ame ground may receive from art, either
certain degrees of &s;ublimity and magnificence,
or certain degrees of variety and beauty; or a
mixture of each kind. In this ca&s;e it remains to
be con&s;idered in which light they can be ren|dered
mo&s;t remarkable, whether as objects, of
beauty, or magnificence. Even the temper of
the proprietor &s;hould not perhaps be wholly
di&s;regarded: for certain complexions of &s;oul will
prefer an orange tree or a myrtle, to an oak or
cedar. However this &s;hould not induce a gardi|ner
to parcel out a lawn into knots of &s;hrub|bery;
or inve&s;t a mountain with a garb of ro&s;es.
This would be like dre&s;&s;ing a giant in a &s;ar&s;enet
gown, or a &s;aracen's head in a bru&s;&s;els night|cap.
Indeed the &s;mall and circular clumps of
firs, which I &s;ee planted upon &s;ome fine large
&s;wells, put me often in mind of a coronet placed
<PB N="139" REF="145">
on an elephant or camel's back. I &s;ay a gardi|ner
&s;hould not do this, any more than a poet
&s;hould attempt to write of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia
in the &s;tyle of Philips. On the other &s;ide, what
would become of Lesbia's &s;parrow &s;hould it be
treated in the &s;ame language with the anger of
Achilles?</P>
<P>Gardiners may be divided into three &s;orts, the
land&s;kip gardiner, the parterre gardiner, and
the kitchen gardiner, agreeably to our fir&s;t di|vi&s;ion
of gardens.</P>
<P>I HAVE u&s;ed the word land&s;kip-gardiners; be|cau&s;e
in pur&s;uance of our pre&s;ent ta&s;te in gar|dening,
every good painter of land&s;kip appears
to me the mo&s;t proper de&s;igner. The misfortune
of it, is, that the&s;e painters are apt to regard
the execution of their work, much more than the
choice of &s;ubject,</P>
<P>THE art of di&s;tancing and approximating,
comes truly within their &s;phere: the former by
the gradual diminution of di&s;tinctne&s;s, and of
&s;ize; the latter by the rever&s;e. A &s;trait lined
avenue that is widened in front, and planted there
with ewe trees, then firs, then with trees more
and more fady, till they end in the almond-wil|low,
<PB N="140" REF="146">
or &s;ilver o&s;ier; will produce a very remark|able
deception of the former kind; which de|ception
will be encrea&s;ed, if the nearer dark
trees, are proportionable and truly larger than
tho&s;e at the end of the avenue that are more
fady.</P>
<P>To di&s;tance a building, plant as near as you
can to it, two or three circles of different co|loured
greens&mdash;Ever-greens are be&s;t for all &s;uch
purpo&s;es&mdash;Suppo&s;e the outer one of holly, and the
next of laurel, &amp;c. The con&s;equence will be that
the imagination immediately allows a &s;pace be|twixt
the&s;e circles and another betwixt the hou&s;e
and them; and as the imagined &s;pace is indetermi|nate,
if your building be dim-coloured, it will not
appear incon&s;iderable. The imagination is a greater
magnifier than a micro&s;copic gla&s;s. And on this
head, I have known &s;ome in&s;tances, where by &s;hew|ing
intermediate ground, the di&s;tance has ap|peared
le&s;s, than while an hedge or grove con|cealed
it.</P>
<P>HEDGES, appearing as &s;uch, are univer&s;ally
bad. They di&s;cover art in nature's province.</P>
<P>TREES in hedges partake of their artificiali|ty,
and become a part of them. There is no
<PB N="141" REF="147">
more &s;udden, and obvious improvement, than an
hedge removed, and the trees remaining; yet
not in &s;uch manner as to mark out the former
hedge.</P>
<P>WATER &s;hould ever appear, as an irregular
lake, or winding &s;tream.</P>
<P>I&s;lands give beauty, if the water be adequate;
but le&s;&s;en grandeur through variety.</P>
<P>IT was the wi&s;e remark of &s;ome &s;agacious ob|&s;erver,
that familiarity is for the mo&s;t part pro|ductive
of contempt. Gracele&s;s offspring of &s;o
amiable a parent! Unfortunate beings that we
are, who&s;e enjoyments mu&s;t be either checked,
or prove de&s;tructive of them&s;elves. Our pa&s;&s;ions
are permitted to &s;ip a little plea&s;ure; but are
extingui&s;hed by indulgence, like a lamp over|whelmed
with oil. Hence we neglect the beauty
with which we have been intimate; nor would
any addition it could receive, prove an equivalent
for the advantage it derived from the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion.
Thus negligent of graces that have
the merit of reality, we too often prefer imagi|nary
ones that have only the charm of novelty:
And hence we may account, in general, for the
<PB N="142" REF="148">
preference of art to nature, ill our old fa&s;hioned
gardens.</P>
<P>ART, indeed, is often requi&s;ite to collect and
epitomize the beauties of nature; but &s;hould
never be &s;uffered to &s;et her mark upon them:
I mean in regard to tho&s;e articles that are of na|ture's
province; the &s;haping of ground, the
planting bf trees, and the di&s;po&s;ition of lakes and
rivulets. Many more particulars will &s;oon oc|cur,
which, however, &s;he is allowed to regulate,
&s;omewhat clande&s;tinely, upon the following ac|count&mdash;Man
is not capable of comprehending the
univer&s;e at one &s;urvey. Had he faculties equal
to this, he might well be cen&s;ured for any mi|nute
regulations of his own. It were the &s;ame,
as if, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he &s;trove to find
amu&s;ement in contriving the fabrick of an ant's
ne&s;t, or the partitions of a bee-hive. But we
are placed in the corner of a &s;phere; endued
neither with organs, nor allowed a &s;tation, pro|per
to give us an univer&s;al view; or to exhibit
to us the variety, the orderly proportions, and
di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;y&s;tem. We perceive many
breaks and blemi&s;hes, &s;everal neglected and un|variegated
places in the part; which, in the
whole would appear either imperceptible, or
beautiful. And we might as rationally expect a
<PB N="143" REF="149">
&s;nail to be &s;atisfied with the beauty of our par|terres,
&s;lopes, and terra&s;&s;es&mdash;or an ant to prefer
our buildings to her own orderly range of gra|naries,
as that man &s;hould be &s;atisfied, without a
&s;ingle thought that he can improve the &s;pot that
falls to his &s;hare. But, though art be nece&s;&s;ary
for collecting nature's beauties, by what rea&s;on
is &s;he authorized to thwart and to oppo&s;e her?
Why, fanta&s;tically endeavor to humanize tho&s;e
vegetables, of which nature, di&s;creet nature,
thought it proper to make trees? Why endow
the vegetable bird with wings, which nature has
made momentarily dependent upon the &s;oil?
Here art &s;eems very affectedly to make a di&s;play
of that indu&s;try, which it is her glory to conceal.
The &s;tone which repre&s;ents an a&s;teri&s;k, is valued
only on account of it's natural production: Nor
do we view with plea&s;ure the laboured carvings
and futile diligence of Gothic arti&s;ts. We view
with much more &s;atisfaction &s;ome plain Grecian
fabric, where art, indeed, has been equally,
but le&s;s vi&s;ibly, indu&s;trious. It is thus we, in|deed,
admire the &s;hining texture of the &s;ilk|worm;
but we loath the puny author, when &s;he
thinks proper to emerge; and to di&s;gu&s;t us with
the appearance of &s;o vile a grub.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">
BUT this is merely true in regard to the par|ticulars
of nature's province; Wherein art can
only appear as the mo&s;t abject va&s;&s;al, and had,
therefore, better not appear at all. The ca&s;e
is different where &s;he has the direction of build|ings,
u&s;eful or ornamental; or, perhaps, claims
as much honor from temples, as the deities to
whom they are in&s;cribed. Here then it is her
intere&s;t to be &s;een as much as po&s;&s;ible: And,
though nature appear doubly beautiful by the
contra&s;t her &s;tructures furni&s;h, it is not ea&s;y
for her to confer a benefit which nature, on her
&s;ide, will not repay.</P>
<P>A RURAL &s;cene to me is never perfect with|out
the addition of &s;ome kind of building: In|deed
I have known a &s;car of rock-work, in great
mea&s;ure, &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P>IN gardening it is no &s;mall point to enforce
either grandeur or beauty by &s;urprize; for in|&s;tance,
by abrupt tran&s;ition from their contraries&mdash;but
to lay a &s;tre&s;s upon &s;urprize only; for ex|ample,
on the &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by an aha!
without including any nobler purpo&s;e; is a &s;ym|ptom
of bad ta&s;te, and a violent fonde&s;s for mere
concetto.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151">
GRANDEUR and beauty are &s;o very oppo&s;ite,
that you often dimini&s;h the one as you encrea&s;e
the other. Variety is mo&s;t a-kin to the latter,
&s;implicity to the former.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a large hill, varied by art, with
large patches of different-colored clumps, &s;cars
of rock, chalk quarries, villages, or farm-hou&s;es;
you will have, perhaps, a more beautiful &s;cene,
but much le&s;s grand than it was before.</P>
<P>IN many in&s;tances, it is mo&s;t eligible to com|pound
your &s;cene of beauty and grandeur&mdash;Sup|po&s;e
a magnificent &s;well ari&s;ing out of a well-va|riegated
valley; it would be di&s;advantageous to
encrea&s;e it's beauty, by means de&s;tructive to it's
magnificence.</P>
<P>THERE may po&s;&s;ibly, but there &s;eldom happens,
any occa&s;ion to fill up valleys, with trees or other|wi&s;e.
It is for the mo&s;t part the gardener's bu&s;ine&s;s
to remove trees, or ought that fills up the low
ground; and to give, as far as nature allows, an
artificial eminence to the high.</P>
<P>THE hedge-row apple-trees in Hereford&s;hire
afford a mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery, at the time they
<PB N="146" REF="152">
are in blo&s;&s;om: But the pro&s;pect would be really
grander, did it con&s;i&s;t of &s;imple foliage. For the
&s;ame rea&s;on, a large oak (or beech) in autumn,
is a grander object than the &s;ame in &s;pring. The
&s;prightly green, is then obfu&s;cated.</P>
<P>SMOOTHNESS and ea&s;y tran&s;itions are no
&s;mall ingredient in the beautiful; abrupt and rect|angular
breaks have more of the nature of the
&s;ublime. Thus a tapering &s;pire is, perhaps, a
more beautiful object than a tower, which is
grander.</P>
<P>MANY of the different opinions relating to
the preference to be given to &s;eats, villas, &amp;c.
are owing to want of di&s;tinction betwixt the
beautiful and the magnificent. Both the former
and the latter plea&s;e; but there are imaginations
particularly adapted to the one, and to the
other.</P>
<P>MR. ADDISON thought an open uninclo&s;ed
champain country, formed the be&s;t land&s;kip.
Somewhat here is to be con&s;idered. Large unva|riegated,
&s;imple objects have the be&s;t preten&s;ions
to &s;ublimity; a large mountain, who&s;e &s;ides are
unvaried with objects, is grander than one with
<PB N="147" REF="153">
infinite variety: But then it's beauty is propor|tionably
le&s;s.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I think a plain &s;pace near the eye
gives it a kind of liberty it loves: And then
the picture, whether you chu&s;e the grand or
beautiful, &s;hould be held up at it's proper di|&s;tance.
Variety is the principal ingredient in
beauty; and &s;implicity is e&s;&s;ential to grandeur.</P>
<P>OFFENSIVE objects, at a proper di&s;tance, ac|quire
even a degree of beauty: For in&s;tance,

con&s;ider fortune as the godde&s;s of wit.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167">
WHAT plea&s;ure it is to pay one's debts! I
remember to have heard Sir T. Lyttleton make
the &s;ame ob&s;ervation. It &s;eems to flow from a
combination of circum&s;tances, each of which is
productive of plea&s;ure. In the fir&s;t place it re|moves
that unea&s;ine&s;s, which a true &s;pirit feels
from dependence and obligation. It affords plea|&s;ure
to the creditor, and therefore gratifies our
&s;ocial affection. It promotes that future confi|dence,
which is &s;o very intere&s;ting to an hone&s;t
mind: It opens a pro&s;pect of being readily &s;up|plied,
with what we want on future occa&s;ions:
It leaves a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own virtue: and
it is a mea&s;ure we know to be right, both in point
of ju&s;tice and of &s;ound oeconomy. Finally, it is
a main &s;upport of &s;imple reputation.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim with me (and I would recom|mend
it to others al&s;o, upon the &s;core of pru|dence)
whenever I lo&s;e a per&s;on's friend&s;hip,
who generally commences enemy, to engage a
fre&s;h friend in his place. And this may be be&s;t
effected by bringing over &s;ome of one's enemies;
by which means one is a gainer, having an ene|my
the le&s;s, and the &s;ame number of friends.
Such a method of proceeding &s;hould I think be
<PB N="162" REF="168">
as regularly ob&s;erved, as the di&s;tribution of va|cant
ribbons, upon the death of Knights of the
Garter.</P>
<P>IT has been a maxim with me to admit of an
ea&s;y reconciliaton with a per&s;on who&s;e offence
proceeded from no depravity of heart: But
where I was convinced it did &s;o, to forego, for
my own &s;ake, all opportunities of revenge: to
forget the per&s;ons of my enemies as much as I
was able, and to call to remembrance, in their
place, the more plea&s;ing idea of my friends. I
am convinced that I have derived no &s;mall &s;hare
of happine&s;s from this principle.</P>
<P>I HAVE been formerly &s;o &s;illy as to hope, that
every &s;ervant I had might be made a friend: I
am now convinced that the nature of &s;ervitude
generally bears a contrary tendency. Peoples
characters are to be chiefly collected from their
education and place in life: Birth it&s;elf does
but little. Kings in general are born with
the &s;ame propen&s;ities as other men, but yet
it is probable from the licence and flattery
that attends their education, that they will be
more haughty, more luxurious, and more&s;ubjected
to their pa&s;&s;ions, than any men be&s;ide. I que&s;tion
not but there are many attorneys born with open
<PB N="163" REF="169">
and hone&s;t hearts; but I know not one, that has
had the lea&s;t practice, who is not &s;elfi&s;h, tricki&s;h,
and di&s;ingenuous. So it is the nature of &s;ervi|tude
to di&s;card all generous motives of obe|dience;
and to point out no other than tho&s;e
&s;coundrel ones of intere&s;t and fear. There are
however &s;ome exceptions to this rule, which I

<P>THE Splendid &s;hilling, of Mr. Phillips, and

<P>I SHOULD imagine, that, in &s;ome or mo&s;t of

is owing to the &s;upernumerary &s;yllable; yet
it requires a nice ear for the di&s;po&s;ition of it (for
it mu&s;t not be univer&s;al); and, with this, may
give at once an harmonious flow, a natural ea&s;e,

injuring the thread of a di&s;cour&s;e. It is true it
might require &s;ome addre&s;s to interweave them
gracefully into the text; but how much more
agreeable would be the effect, than to interrupt
the reader by &s;uch frequent avocations? How

harra&s;s and infe&s;t the laity according to law, and
who conceal their real names under that of a

<P>How ready have all nations been, after
having allowed a proper portion of laud and
prai&s;e to their own abilities, to attribute
their &s;ucce&s;s in war to the peculiar favor of a
ju&s;t Providence! Perhaps this con&s;truction, as it
is often applyed, argues more of pre&s;umption
<PB N="303" REF="301">
than gratitude. In the fir&s;t place, &s;uch is the
partiality of the human heart, that, perhaps,
two ho&s;tile nations may alike rely upon the
ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; and which of the two has
the better claim to it, none but Providence can it&s;elf
di&s;cover. In the next, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved,
that &s;ucce&s;s by no means demon&s;trates ju&s;tice.
Again, we mu&s;t not wholly forget to con&s;ider,
that &s;ucce&s;s may be no more than a means of
de&s;truction. And la&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s to be
really and ab&s;olutely good, do we find that
individuals are always favored with it in pro|portion
to their de&s;ert; and if not individuals,
why mu&s;t we then &s;uppo&s;e it to be the uniform
recompence of &s;ociety?</P>
<P>IT is often given as a rea&s;on why it is incum|bent
on God Almighty's ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h or re|ward
&s;ocieties, in this world, becau&s;e, hereafter,
they cannot be puni&s;hed or rewarded on account
of their di&s;&s;olution. It is, indeed, true that hu|man
vengeance mu&s;t act frequently in the gro&s;s;
and whenever a government declares war again&s;t
a foreign &s;ociety, or finds it needful to cha&s;ti&s;e
any part of it's own, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity involve
&s;ome innocent individuals, with the guilty. But
it does not appear &s;o evident, that an omni&s;cient
and omnipotent Being, who knows the &s;ecrets of
<PB N="304" REF="302">
all hearts, and is able to make a di&s;tinction in
his puni&s;hments, will judge his unhappy creatures
by the&s;e indi&s;criminate and imperfect laws.</P>
<P>SOCIETIES then are to be con&s;idered as the
ca&s;ual or arbitrary a&s;&s;ortments of human in&s;ti|tution.
To &s;uppo&s;e that God Almighty will, by
means of puni&s;hments, often called judgments,
de&s;troy them promi&s;cuou&s;ly, is to &s;uppo&s;e that
he will regulate his government according to the
cabals of human wi&s;dom. I mean to be under|&s;tood
here, with regard to what are called judg|ments,
or, in other words, praeternatural inter|po&s;itions
of Providence. In a natural way, the
con&s;titution of the univer&s;e requires, that the
good mu&s;t often &s;uffer with the bad part of
&s;ociety. But in regard to judgments upon whole
bodies (which we have days appointed to depre|cate)
let us introduce a ca&s;e, which may &s;erve
to illu&s;trate the improbability.</P>
<P>SOCIETIES, I &s;uppo&s;e then, are not divine but
human bundles.</P>
<P>IMAGINE a man to mix a large quantity of
&s;and and gunpowder; then parcel out the com|po&s;ition
into different heaps, and apply fire to
them &s;eparately, The fire, it is very obvious,
<PB N="305" REF="303">
would take no notice of the bundles; would by no
means con&s;ume, here and there, a bundle in the
gro&s;s, but would affect that part of every por|tion
that was combu&s;tible.</P>
<P>IT may &s;peciou&s;ly enough be &s;aid, what greater
inju&s;tice is it to puni&s;h a &s;ociety promi&s;cuou&s;ly,
than to involve an innocent &s;on in the puni&s;h|ment
due to a &s;inful father? To this I an&s;wer,
the natural &s;y&s;tem (which we need not doubt,
upon the whole, is right) occa&s;ions both the good
and bad to &s;uffer many times indi&s;criminately.
But they go much further&mdash;They &s;ay God, as
it were, interferes in oppo&s;ition to the &s;ettled
cour&s;e of things to puni&s;h, and include &s;ocieties
in one promi&s;cuous vengeance. Were he to in|flict
extraordinary puni&s;hments di&s;tinct from tho&s;e
which &s;in entails upon us, he &s;urely would not
regulate them by mere human a&s;&s;ortments, but
would make the ju&s;ter di&s;tinction of good and
evil individuals.</P>
<P>NEITHER do I &s;ee why it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that

<P>I BELIEVE that, generally &s;peaking, per&s;ons
eminent in one branch of ta&s;te, have the
principles of the re&s;t; and to try this, I have
often &s;ollicited a &s;tranger to hum a tune, and
have &s;eldom failed of &s;ucce&s;s. This, however,
does not extend to talents beyond the &s;phere of
ta&s;te; and Handel was evidently wrong, when
he fancied him&s;elf born to command a troop of
hor&s;e.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in general, may be divided into
per&s;ons of under&s;tanding, and per&s;ons of genius;
each of which will admit of many &s;ubordinate
degrees. By per&s;ons of under&s;tanding, I mean
per&s;ons of found judgment; formed for mathe|matical
deductions, and clear argumentation. By
per&s;ons of genius, I would characterize tho&s;e in
whom true and genuine fancy predominates;
and this whether a&s;&s;i&s;ted, or not, by culti|vation.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="310">
I HAVE thought that genius and judgment
may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be repre&s;ented by a
liquid and a &s;olid. The former is, generally
&s;peaking, remarkable for it's &s;en&s;ibility, but
then lo&s;es it's impre&s;&s;ion &s;oon: The latter is le&s;s
&s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ion, but retains it longer.</P>

<P>THERE is hardly any thing &s;o uncommon, as a
true native ta&s;te improved by education.</P>
<P>THE object of ta&s;te is corporeal beauty;
for though there is manife&s;tly a <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; a
pulchrum, an hone&s;tum, and decorum, in moral
actions; and although a man of ta&s;te that is not
virtuous, commits a greater violence upon his
<PB N="313" REF="311">
&s;entiments than any other per&s;on; yet, in the
ordinary cour&s;e of &s;peaking, a per&s;on is not
termed a man of ta&s;te, merely becau&s;e he is a
man of virtue.</P>
<P>ALL beauty may be divided into ab&s;olute, and
relative, and what is compounded of both.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon to hear a modern Quixote
in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;uperiority of his idol or Dulcinea;
and, not content to pay his own tribute of ado|ration,
demand, that of others in favor of her ac|compli&s;hments.
Tho&s;e of grave and &s;ober &s;en&s;e
cannot avoid wondering at a difference of opi|nions,
which are in truth &s;upported by no cri|terion.</P>
<P>EVERY one, therefore, ought to fix &s;ome mea|&s;ure
of beauty, before he grows eloquent upon
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>EVERY thing &s;eems to derive it's preten&s;ions
to beauty, on account of its color, &s;moothne&s;s,
variety, uniformity, partial re&s;emblance to &s;ome|thing
el&s;e, proportion, or &s;uitablene&s;s to the
end propo&s;ed, &s;ome connexion of ideas, or a
mixture of all the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="312">
As to the beauty of colors, their pre&s;ent
effect &s;eems in proportion to their impul&s;e; and

<P>RESEMBLANCES wrought by art; pictures,

<P>COLUMNS, proportioned to their incumbent
weight; but herein we &s;uppo&s;e omogeneous ma|terials;
it is otherwi&s;e, in ca&s;e we know that a
column is made of iron.</P>
<P>HABIT, herein, &s;eems to have an influence
to which we can affix no bounds. Suppo&s;e the
generality of mankind formed with a mouth from
ear to ear, and that it were requi&s;ite in point of
re&s;piration, would not the pre&s;ent make of mouths,
have &s;ubjected a man to the name of Bocha
chica?</P>
<P>IT is probable, that a clown would require
more color in his Chloe's face, than a courtier.</P>
<P>WE may &s;ee daily the &s;trange effects of habit
in re&s;pect of fa&s;hion. To what colors, or pro|portions,
does it not reconcile us!</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="313">
CONCEIT is fal&s;e ta&s;te; and very widely dif|ferent
from no ta&s;te at all.</P>
<P>BEAUTY of per&s;on &s;hould, perhaps, be e&s;ti|mated
according to the proportion it bears to
&s;uch a make and features, as are mo&s;t likely to
produce the love of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex. The look
of dignity, the look of wi&s;dom, the look of de|licacy
and refinement &s;eem, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
foreign. Perhaps the appearance of &s;en&s;ibility
may be one ingredient; and that of health,
another. At lea&s;t, a cadaverous countenance is
the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting in the world.</P>
<P>I KNOW not, if one rea&s;on of the different
opinions concerning beauty, be not owing to
&s;elf-love.'People are apt to form &s;ome criterion,
from their own per&s;ons, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. A tall
per&s;on approves the look of a folio or octavo: A
&s;quare thick-&s;et man is more delighted with a
quarto. This in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, may &s;erve to
explain what I intend.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it &s;ometimes happens that a per&s;on
may have what the arti&s;ts call an ear and an
eye, without ta&s;te: For in&s;tance, a man may &s;ome|times
have a quickne&s;s in di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;imi|litude
<PB N="316" REF="314">
or difference of lines and &s;ounds, without
any &s;kill to give the proper preference betwixt
the combinations of them.</P>
<P>TASTE produces different effects upon different
complexions. It con&s;i&s;ts, as I have often ob&s;erved,
in the appetite and the di&s;cernment; then mo&s;t
properly &s;o called, when they are united in equal
proportions.</P>
<P>WHERE the di&s;cernment is predominant, a
per&s;on is plea&s;ed with fewer objects, and re|quires
perfection in what he &s;ees. Where the
appetite prevails, he is &s;o much attached to
beauty, that he feels a gratification in every
degree, in which it is manife&s;ted. I frankly own
my&s;elf to be of this latter cla&s;s: I love painting
and &s;tatuary &s;o well, as to be not undelighted
with moderate performances.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on people vary, in their opinions of
a portrait, I mean, with regard to the re&s;emblance
it bears to the original; &s;eems no other, than that
they lay &s;tre&s;s on different features in the ori|ginal;
and this different &s;tre&s;s is owing to dif|ferent
complexions of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="315">
PEOPLE of little or no ta&s;te commend a per&s;on
for it's corpulency. I cannot &s;ee, why an ex|cre&s;cence
of belly, cheek, or chin, &s;hould be
deemed more beautiful than a wen on any other
part of the body. Through a connexion of ideas,
it may form the beauty of a pig or an ox.</P>
<P>THERE feems a pretty exact analogy between
the objects and the &s;en&s;es. Some tunes, &s;ome
ta&s;tes, &s;ome vi&s;ible objects, plea&s;e at fir&s;t, and
that only; others, only by degrees, and then long.&mdash;(Ra&s;pberry-jelly-Green-tea-Alley-Croaker&mdash;Air
in Ariadne&mdash;A Baron's Robe&mdash;and a Bi|&s;hops
Lawn). Perhaps &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;tances
may be ill enough cho&s;en; but the thing is
true.</P>
<P>TUNES, with words, plea&s;e me the more in
proportion as they approach nearer to the natu|ral
accent of the words to which they are a&s;|&s;igned.
Scotch tunes often end high: Their
language does the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To how very great a degree, the appearance
of health alone is beauty, I am not able to de|termine.
I pre&s;ume the mo&s;t regular and well|proportioned
form of limbs and features is at
<PB N="318" REF="316">
the &s;ame time the mo&s;t: healthful one: The fitte&s;t
to perform the functions and operations of the
body. If &s;o, a perfectly healthful form, is a
perfectly beautiful form&mdash;Health is beauty, and
the mo&s;t perfect health is the mo&s;t perfect beau|ty.
To have recour&s;e to experience. The mo&s;t
&s;ickly and cadaverous countenance is the lea&s;t
provocative to love; or rather the mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent
with it. A florid look, to appear beau|tiful,
mu&s;t be the bloom of health, and not the
glow of a fever.</P>
<P>AN obvious connexion may be traced betwixt
moral and phy&s;ical beauty; the love of &s;ymmetry,
and the love of virtue; an elegant ta&s;te, and
perfect hone&s;ty. We may, we mu&s;t, ri&s;e from
the love of natural to that of moral beauty:
Such is the conclu&s;ion of Plato, and of my Lord
Shaftsbury.</P>
<P>WHEREVER there is a want of ta&s;te, we ge|nerally
ob&s;erve a love of money, and cunning:
And whenever ta&s;te prevails, a want of prudence,
and an utter di&s;regard to money.</P>
<P>TASTE (or a ju&s;t reli&s;h of beauty) &s;eems to
di&s;tingui&s;h us from the brute creation, as much
as intellect, or rea&s;on. We do not find that
<PB N="319" REF="317">
brutes have any &s;en&s;ation of this &s;ort. A bull
is goaded by the love of &s;ex in general, with|out
the lea&s;t appearance of any di&s;tinction in
favor of the more beautiful individual. Accord|ingly
men, devoid of ta&s;te, are in a great mea|&s;ure
indifferent as to make, complexion, feature;
and find a difference of &s;ex &s;ufficient to excite
their pa&s;&s;ion in all its fervor. It is not thus where
there is a ta&s;te for beauty, either accurate or
erroneous. The per&s;on of a good ta&s;te, re|quires
real beauty in the object of his pa&s;&s;ion;
and the per&s;on of bad ta&s;te, requires &s;omething
which he &s;ub&s;titutes in the place of beauty.</P>
<P>PERSONS of ta&s;te, it has been a&s;&s;erted, are
al&s;o the be&s;t qualified to di&s;tingui&s;h, and the
mo&s;t prone to admire moral virtue: Nor does it
invalidate this maxim, that their practice does
not corre&s;pond. The power of acting virtuou&s;ly
depends in a great mea&s;ure upon with&s;tanding
a pre&s;ent, and perhaps &s;en&s;ual, gratification,
for the &s;ake of a more di&s;tant, and intellectual
&s;atisfaction. Now, as per&s;ons of fine ta&s;te are
men of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ual appetites, it happens
that in ballancing pre&s;ent and future, they are
apt enough to allow an unrea&s;onable advantage
to the former. On the other hand, a more phleg|matick
<PB N="320" REF="318">
character may, with no greater &s;elf-denial,
allow the future, fairer play. But let us wave
the merely &s;en&s;ual indulgences; and let us con|&s;ider
the man of ta&s;te in regard to points of
meum and tuum; in regard to the virtues of for|givene&s;s;
in regard to charity, compassion, mu|nificence,
and magnanimity; and we cannot fail
to vote his ta&s;te the glorious triumph which it
de&s;erves.</P>
<P>THERE is a kind of counter-ta&s;te, founded
on &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, which maintains
a &s;ort of rival&s;hip with the true; and may
be expre&s;&s;ed by the name Concetto. Such is
the fondne&s;s of &s;ome per&s;ons for a knife-ha&s;t
made from the royal-oak, or a tobacco|&s;topper
from a mulberry-tree of Shake&s;pear's
own planting. It gratifies an empty curio&s;ity.
Such is the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of Apollo, and
the nine Mu&s;es in a piece of agate; a dog ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in feathers, or a wood-cock in mohair.
They &s;erve to give &s;urprize. But a ju&s;t fancy
will no more e&s;teem a picture, becau&s;e it proves
to be produced by &s;hells, than a writer would
prefer a pen, becau&s;e a per&s;on made it with
his toes. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, difficulty &s;hould not
be allowed to give a ca&s;ting weight; nor a needle

<P>PERHAPS no print, or even painting, is capa|ble
of producing a figure an&s;werable to the idea
which poetry or hi&s;tory has given us of great
men: A Cicero, for in&s;tance, an Homer, a Cato,
or an Alexander. The &s;ame, perhaps, is true
of the grandeur of &s;ome antient buildings&mdash;And
the rea&s;on is, that the effects of a pencil are
di&s;tinct and limited, whereas the de&s;criptions of
the pen leave the imagination room to expatiate;
and Burke has made it extremely obvious, that
indi&s;tinctne&s;s of out-line is one &s;ource of the
&s;ublime.</P>
<P>WHAT an ab&s;urdity is it, in the framing even
prints to &s;uffer a margin of white paper to ap|pear
beyond the ground; de&s;troying half the
relievo, the lights are intended to produce?
Frames ought to contra&s;te with paintings; or to
appear as di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible: For which rea&s;on,
<PB N="322" REF="320">
frames of wood inlaid, or otherwi&s;e variegated
with colors, are le&s;s &s;uitable than gilt ones,
which exhibiting an appearance of metal afford
the be&s;t contra&s;te with color.</P>
<P>THE peculiar expre&s;&s;ion in &s;ome portraits is
owing to the greater or le&s;s manifestation of the
&s;oul in &s;ome of the features.</P>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, a &s;ublime, and a beauti|ful,
in the very make of a face, exclu&s;ive of any
particular expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul; or, at lea&s;t,
not expre&s;&s;ive of any other than a tame di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate
one. We &s;ee often what the world
calls regular features, and a good complexion,
almo&s;t totally unanimated by any di&s;covery of the
temper, or under&s;tanding. Whenever the re|gularity
of feature, beauty of complexion, the
&s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of &s;agacity and genero&s;ity,
concur in one face, the features are irre&s;i&s;|tible.</P>
<P>BUT even here it is to be ob&s;erved, that a &s;ort
of &s;ympathy has a prodigious bia&s;s&mdash;Thus a
pen&s;ive beauty, with regular features and com|plexion,
will have the preference with a &s;pec|tator
of the pen&s;ive ca&s;t; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="321">
THE &s;oul appears to me to di&s;cover her&s;elf
mo&s;t in the mouth and eyes with this difference,
that the mouth &s;eems the more expre&s;&s;ive of
the temper, and the eye of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Is a portrait, &s;uppo&s;ing it as like as can be to
the per&s;on for whom it is drawn, a more or le&s;s
beautiful object than the original face? I &s;hould
think, a perfect face mu&s;t be much more plea&s;ing
than any repre&s;entation of it; and a &s;ett of ugly
features, much more ugly, than the mo&s;t exact
re&s;emblance that can be drawn, of them. Paint|ing
can do much by means of &s;hades; but not
equal the force of real relievo; on which ac|count
it may be the advantage of bad features to
have their effect dimini&s;hed; but &s;urely, never
can be the intere&s;t of good ones.</P>

<P>AN harmony in colors &s;eems as requi&s;ite, as a

&s;ides of any thing &s;hould &s;hew a ballance, or an
appearance pf equal quantity, if we would &s;trive

<P>IT is evident enough to me, that per&s;ons often
occur who may be &s;aid to have an ear to mu&s;ick,
and an eye for proportions in vi&s;ible objects,
who neverthele&s;s can hardly be &s;aid to have a

beauty depend greatly upon habit.&mdash;What I
mean is, upon the familiarity with objects which
we happen to have &s;een &s;ince we came into the
world.&mdash;Our ta&s;te for uniformity, from what we
have ob&s;erved in the individual parts of nature,
a man, a tree, a bea&s;t, a bird, or in&s;ect, &amp;c. our
ta&s;te for regularity from what is within our
power to ob&s;erve in the &s;everal perfections of

<P>A LAND SKIP, for in&s;tance, is always irregular;
and to u&s;e regularity in painting, or gardening,
would make our work unnatural and di&s;agreeable.
Thus we allow beauty to the different, and al|mo&s;t
oppo&s;ite proportions of all animals.</P>
<P>THERE is, I think, a beauty in &s;ome forms, in|dependent
of any u&s;e to which they can be ap|plied.
I know not whether this may not be re|&s;olved

<P>IT may be convenient to divide beauty into
the ab&s;olute, and the relative. Ab&s;olute is that
above-mentioned. Relative is that by which an
object, or part of an object, plea&s;es, through the
relation it bears to &s;ome other.</P>
<P>OUR ta&s;te of beauty is, perhaps, compounded
of all the ideas that have entered the imagina|tion
from our birth. This &s;eems to occa&s;ion the
different opinion that prevails concerning it.
For in&s;tance, a foreign eye e&s;teems tho&s;e features

<P>Is it not then likely that tho&s;e who have &s;een

Becau&s;e they will judge true&s;t of the general
proportion which was intended by the Creator;
and is be&s;t.</P>
<P>THE beauty of mo&s;t objects is partly of the
ab&s;olute, and partly of the relative kind. A
Corinthian pillar has &s;ome beauty dependent on
<PB N="329" REF="327">
it's variety and &s;moothne&s;s; which I would call
ab&s;olute; it has al&s;o a relative beauty, dependent
on it's taperne&s;s and foliage; which authors &s;ay
was fir&s;t copied from the leaves of plants, and
the &s;hape of a tree.</P>
<P>UNIFORMITY &s;hould, perhaps, be added as
another &s;ource of ab&s;olute beauty (when it ap|pears
in one &s;ingle object) I do not know any other
rea&s;on, but that it renders the whole more ea&s;ily
comprehended. It &s;eems that nature her&s;elf con|&s;iders
it as beauty, as the external parts of the
human frame are made uniform to plea&s;e the
&s;ight; which is rarely the ca&s;e of the internal,
that are not &s;een.</P>
<P>HUTCHINSON determines ab&s;olute beauty to
depend on this, and on variety; and &s;ays it is
in a compound ratio of both. Thus an octagon
excels a &s;quare; and a &s;quare, a figure of un|equal
&s;ides: But carry variety to an extreme, and
it lo&s;es it's effect. For in&s;tance, multiply the
number of angles till the mind lo&s;es the unifor|mity
of parts, and the figure is le&s;s plea&s;ing: Or,
as it approaches nearer to a round, it may be
&s;aid to be robbed of it's variety.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="328">
BUT amid&s;t all the&s;e eulogiums of variety it
is proper to ob&s;erve that novelty &s;ometimes re|quires
a little abatement. I mean, that &s;ome de|gree
of familiarity introduces a di&s;covery of rela|tive
beauty, more than adequate to the bloom
of novelty.&mdash;This is, now and then, obvious in
the features of a face, the air of &s;ome tunes,
and the flavor of &s;ome di&s;hes. In &s;hort, it re|quires
&s;ome familiarity to become acquainted
with the relation that parts bear unto the whole;
or one object to another.</P>
<P>VARIETY, in the &s;ame object, where the beau|ty
does not depend on imitation (which is the
ca&s;e in foliage, bu&s;tos, ba&s;&s;o-relievos, painting)
requires uniformity. For in&s;tance, an octagon is
much more beautiful than a figure of unequal
&s;ides; which is at once various and di&s;agreeable.</P>

THE LEASOWES<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following de&s;cription was intended to give a friend &s;ome idea of the Lea&s;owes&mdash;which having been &s;o ju&s;tly ad|mired by per&s;ons of the be&s;t ta&s;te, and celebrated by the Mu&s;e of &s;uch an original genius as Mr. Shen&s;tone; it is hoped the public will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with this &s;light attempt to perpe|tuate tho&s;e beauties which time, or the different ta&s;te of &s;ome future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, may de&s;troy.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THE Lea&s;owes is &s;ituate in the pari&s;h of
Hales Owen, a &s;mall market town, in
the county of Salop; but &s;urrounded
by other counties, and thirty miles from
Shrewsbury, as it is near ten to the borders
of Shrop&s;hire. Though a paternal e&s;tate, it
was never di&s;tingui&s;hed for any peculiar beauties
till the time of it's late owner. It was re&s;erved
<PB N="334" REF="332">
for a per&s;on of his ingenuity both to di&s;cover
and improve them; which he has done &s;o effec|tually,
that it is now con&s;idered as among&s;t
the principal of tho&s;e delightful &s;cenes, which
per&s;ons of ta&s;te, in the pre&s;ent age, are de&s;irous
to &s;ee. Far from violating it's natural beauties,
Mr. Shen&s;tone's only &s;tudy was to give them
their full effect. And although the form in
which things now appear, be indeed the con&s;e|quence
of much thought and labor, yet the hand
of art is no way vi&s;ible either in the &s;hape of
ground, the di&s;po&s;ition of trees, or (which are
here &s;o numerous and &s;triking) the romantic fall
of his ca&s;cades.</P>
<P>BUT I will now proceed to a more particular
de&s;cription. About half a mile &s;hort of Hales
Owen, in your way from Birmingham to Bewd|ley,
you quit the great road (at N&deg; I.) and turn
into a green lane on the left hand, where, de|&s;cending
in a winding manner to the bottom of a
deep valley finely &s;haded, the fir&s;t object that
occurs is a kind of ruinated wall, and a &s;mall gate,
within an arch, in&s;cribed The Priory Gate (N&deg;2).
Here, it &s;eems, the company &s;hould properly begin
their walk; but generally chu&s;e to go up with
their hor&s;es or equipage to the hou&s;e (N&deg; 2); from
whence returning they, de&s;cend back into the
<PB N="335" REF="333">
valley. Pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;mall gate (N&deg; 3) at the
bottom of the fine &s;welling lawn that &s;urrounds
the hou&s;e, you enter upon a winding path, with
a piece of water on your right. The path and
water, over-&s;hadowed with trees that grow
upon the &s;lopes of this narrow dingle, render the
&s;cene at once cool, gloomy, &s;olemn, and &s;eque&s;|tered;
and forms &s;o &s;triking a contra&s;te to the
lively &s;cene you have ju&s;t left, that you &s;eem
all on a &s;udden landed in a &s;ubterraneous kind of
region. Winding forward down the valley, you
pa&s;s be&s;ide a &s;mall (N&deg; 4) root-hou&s;e, where on a
rablet are the&s;e lines.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here in cool grot, and mo&s;&s;y cell,</L>
<L>We rural &s;ays and faeries dwell;</L>
<L>Tho' rarely &s;een by mortal eye,</L>
<L>When the pale moon, a&s;cending high,</L>
<L>Darts thro' yon limes her quivering beams,</L>
<L>We fri&s;k it near the&s;e cry&s;tal &s;treams.</L>

<LG>
<L>Her beams reflected from the ware.</L>
<L>Afford the light our revels crave;</L>
<L>The turf, with dailies broider'd o'er,</L>
<L>Exceeds, we wot, the Parian floor;</L>
<L>Nor yet for artful &s;trains we call,</L>
<L>But li&s;ten to the water's fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="336" REF="334">
<L>Would you then ta&s;te our tranquil &s;cene.</L>
<L>Be &s;ure your bo&s;oms be &s;erene;</L>
<L>Devoid of hate, devoid of &s;trife,</L>
<L>Devoid of all that poi&s;ons life:</L>
<L>And much it 'vails you in their place,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tread with awe the&s;e favour'd bowers,</L>

<L>So may your path with &s;weets abound!</L>
<L>So may your couch with re&s;t be crown'd!</L>
<L>But harm betide the wayward &s;wain,</L>
<L>Who dares our hallow'd haunts profane!</L>
</LG>
<P>THESE &s;entiments corre&s;pond as well as po&s;&s;ible
with the ideas we form of the abode of fairies;
and appearing deep in this romantic vally, &s;erve
to keep alive &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic images while this
&s;ort of &s;cene continues.</P>
<P>You now pa&s;s through The Priory (N&deg; 5) Gate
before-mentioned, and are admitted into a part
of the valley &s;omewhat different from the former;
tall trees, high irregular ground, and rugged
&s;cars. The right pre&s;ents you with, perhaps,
the mo&s;t natural, if not the mo&s;t &s;triking of the
many ca&s;cades here found: The left, with a
<PB N="337" REF="335">
&s;loping grove of oaks; and the center, with a
pretty circular land&s;kip appearing through the
trees, of which Hales Owen &s;leeple, and other
objects at a di&s;tance, form an intere&s;ting part.
The (N&deg; 6) &s;eat beneath the ruinated wall has
the&s;e lines of Virgil in&s;cribed, &s;uiting well with
the general tenor of Mr. Shen&s;tone's late &s;itu|ation.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Lucis habitamus opacis</L>
<L>Riparumque toros, et prata recentia rivis</L>
<L>Incolimus.</L></Q>
<P>You now proceed a few paces down the valley
to another bench, where you have this ca&s;cade
in front, which, together with the internal arch
and other appendages, make a pretty irregular
picture. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve once for all, that a num|ber
of the&s;e extempore benches (two &s;tumps
with a tran&s;ver&s;e board) &s;eem chiefly intended
as hints to &s;pectators, le&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing cur&s;orily
thro' the farm they might &s;uffer any of that im|men&s;e
variety the place furni&s;hes, to e&s;cape their
notice. The &s;tream attending us, with it's agreeable
murmurs, as we de&s;cend along this plea&s;ing valley,
we come next to a (N&deg; 7) &s;mall &s;eat, where we
have a &s;loping grove upon the right, and on the left;
a &s;triking vi&s;ta to the &s;teeple of Hales Owen,
which is here &s;een in a new light. We now de|&s;cend
<PB N="338" REF="336">
farther down this &s;hady and &s;eque&s;tered val|ly
accompanied on the right by the &s;ame brawl|ing
rivulet running over pebbles, till it empties
it's &s;elf into a fine piece of (N&deg; 8) water at
the bottom. The path here winding to the
left, conforms to the water before-mentioned;
running round the foot of a &s;mall hill, and ac|companying
this &s;emi-circular lake into another
winding valley, &s;omewhat more open, and not le&s;s
plea&s;ing than the former. However, before we
enter this, it will be proper to mention a &s;eat
about the center of this water &s;cene, where the
ends of it are lo&s;t in the two vallies on each &s;ide;
and in front it is invi&s;ibly connected with another
piece of water, of about twenty acres, open to'
Mr. Shen&s;tone, but not his property. This la&s;t
was a performance of the monks, and part of a
prodigious chain of fi&s;h-ponds that belonged to
Hales Abbey. The back ground of this &s;cene
is very beautiful, and exhibits a picture of vil|lages
and varied ground, finely held up to the
eye.</P>
<P>I SPEAK of all this as already fini&s;hed; but,
through &s;ome misfortune in the mound that;
pounds up the water, it is not compleated.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="337">
WE now leave the (N&deg; 9) Priory upon the left,
which is not meant for an object here, and wind
along into the other valley. And here I cannot
but take notice of the judgment which formed
this piece of water; for although it be not very
large, yet, as it is formed by the concurrence of
three vallies, in which two of the ends are hid,
and in the third it &s;eems to join with the large
extent of water below, it is, to all appearance
unbounded. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I never &s;aw a more
natural bed for water, or any kind of lake that
plea&s;ed me better. But it may be right to
mention, that this water, in it's full extent, has
a yet more important effeft from Mr. Shen&s;tone's
hou&s;e, where it is &s;een to a great advantage. We
now, by a plea&s;ing &s;erpentine walk, enter a nar|row
glade in the valley, the &s;lopes on each &s;ide finely
covered with oaks and beeches, on the left of
which is a (N&deg; 10) common bench, which affords a
retiring place &s;ecluded from every eye, and a
&s;hort re&s;pite, during which the eye repo&s;es on a
fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to a (N&deg; 11) &s;eat beneath a
prodigiou&s;ly fine canopy of &s;preading oak, on the
buck of which is this in&s;cription,
<Q><PB N="340" REF="338">
<L>Huc ades, O Meliboee! caper tibi &s;alvus et
hoedi;</L>
<L>Et &s;i quid ce&s;&s;are potes, requie&s;ce &s;ub umbra.</L></Q>
The picture before it is that of a beautiful home
&s;cene; a &s;mall lawn of well-varied ground en|compa&s;&s;ed
with hills and well-grown oaks, and
embelli&s;hed with a ca&s;t of the piping Faunus,
amid trees and &s;hrubs on a &s;lope upon the left;
and on the right, and nearer the eye, with an
urn thus in&s;cribed,
<Q><L>INGENIO ET AMICITIAe</L>
<L>GULIELMI SOMERVILLE.</L></Q>
And on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide,
<Q><L>G S POSVIT,</L>
<L>Debit&acirc; &s;pargens lacrim&acirc; favillam</L>
<L>Vatis amici.</L></Q>
The &s;cene is enclo&s;ed on all &s;ides by trees, in the
middle only there is an opening, where the lawn is
continued and winds out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>HERE entering a (N&deg; 11) gate, you are led, thro'
a thicket of many &s;orts of willows, into a large
root-hou&s;e, in&s;cribed to the Right Honorable
the Earl of Stamford. It &s;eems, that worthy
<PB N="341" REF="339">
peer was pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t opening of the
ca&s;cade (N&deg; 12), which is the principal object
from the root-hou&s;e, where the eye is pre&s;ented
with a fairy vi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of an irregular
and romantic fall of water, very unu&s;ual, one
hundred and fifty yards in continuity, and a
very &s;triking &s;cene it affords. Other ca&s;cades
may po&s;&s;ibly have the advantage of a greater
de&s;cent, and a larger torrent, but a more wild
and romantic appearance of water, and at the
&s;ame time &s;trictly natural, is what I never &s;aw in
any place whatever. This &s;cene, though com|paratively
&s;mall, is yet aggrandized with &s;o
much art, that we forget the quantity of water
which flows through this clo&s;e and over&s;haded
vally; and are &s;o much tran&s;ported with the in|tricacy
of &s;cene, and the concealed height from
whence it flows, that we, without reflection, add
the idea of magnificence to that of beauty. In
&s;hort, it is not but upon reflection that we find
the &s;tream is not a Niagara, but rather a waterfal
in miniature; and that the &s;ame artifice, upon
a larger &s;cale, were there large trees in&s;tead of
&s;mall ones, and a river in&s;tead of a rill, it would
be capable of forming a &s;cene that would
exceed the utmo&s;t of our ideas. But I will not
dwell longer upon this inimitable &s;cene; tho&s;e
who would admire it properly mu&s;t view it, as
<PB N="342" REF="340">
&s;urely as tho&s;e that view it mu&s;t admire it beyond
almo&s;t any thing they ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>PROCEEDING on the right hand path, the next
&s;eat affords a &s;cene of what Mr. Shen&s;tone u&s;ed to
call his fore&s;t ground, con&s;i&s;ting of wild green
&s;lopes peeping through dingle, or irregular
groups of trees, a confu&s;ed mixture of &s;avage
and cultivated ground, held up to the eye, and
forming a land&s;kip fit for the pencil of Salvator
Ro&s;a.</P>
<P>WINDING on be&s;ide this lawn, which is over|arched
with &s;preading trees, the eye catches at
intervals, over an intermediate hill, the &s;pire of
Hales church, forming here a perfect Obeli&s;k&mdash;the
urn to Mr. Somerville, &amp;c. And now pa&s;&s;ing
through a kind of thicket we arrive at a (N&deg; 13)
natural bower of almo&s;t circular oaks in&s;cribed
in the manner following,
<Q><L>To Mr. DODSLEY,</L>
<L>Come then, my friend, thy &s;ylvan ta&s;te di&s;play,</L>
<L>Come hear thy Faunus tune his ru&s;tic lay;</L>
<L>Ah, rather come, and in the&s;e dells di&s;own</L>
<L>The care of other &s;trains, and tune thine own.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="341">
ON the bank above it, amid the fore-mentioned
&s;hrubs, is a &s;tatue of the piping (N&deg; 14) fawn,
which not only embelli&s;hes this &s;cene, but is
al&s;o &s;een from the court before the hou&s;e, and
from other places. It is &s;urrounded by venerable
oaks, and very happily &s;ituated. From this
bower al&s;o you look down upon the fore-men|tioned
irregular ground &s;hut up with trees on all
&s;ides, except &s;ome few openings to the more
plea&s;ing parts of this grote&s;que and hilly coun|try.
The next little (N&deg; 15) bench affords the fir&s;t,
but, not mo&s;t &s;triking, view of the Priory. It is
indeed a &s;mall building; but &s;een as it is be|neath
trees, and it's extremity al&s;o hid by the
&s;ame, it has in &s;ome &s;ort the dignity and &s;olemn
appearance of a larger edifice.</P>
<P>PASSING through a gate, we enter a &s;mall
open grove, where the fir&s;t &s;eat we find affords
a picture&s;que view, through trees, of a clump
of oaks at a di&s;tance, over-&s;hadowing a little
cottage upon a green hill. We thence imme|diately
enter a perfect dome or circular tem|ple
of magnificent beeches, in the center of
which it was intended to place an antique altar, or
a &s;tatue of Pan. The path, &s;erpentizing through
<PB N="344" REF="342">
this open grove, leads us by an ea&s;y a&s;cent to a
(N^o 16) &s;mall bench with this motto,
<Q><L>Me gelidum nemus</L>
<L>Nympharumque leves cum &s;atyris chori</L>
<L>Secernant populo. HOR.</L></Q>
which alludes to the retired &s;ituation of the
grove. There is al&s;o &s;een, through an opening
to the left, a plea&s;ing land&s;kip of a di&s;tant hill,
with a whited farm-hou&s;e upon the &s;ummit; and
to the right a beautiful round &s;lope, crowned
with a clump of large firs, with a pyramidal &s;eat
on it's center; to which, after no long walk, the
path conducts us.</P>
<P>BUT we fir&s;t come to another view of the Priory,
more advantageous, and at a better di&s;tance, to
which the eye is led down a green &s;lope, through
a &s;cenery of tall oaks, in a mo&s;t agreeable man|ner;
the grove we have ju&s;t pa&s;t on one &s;ide,
and a hill of trees and thicket on the other;
conducting the eye to a narrow opening through
which it appears.</P>
<P>WE now a&s;cend to a (N&deg; 17) a &s;mall bench
where the circumjacent country begins to open;
in particular a gla&s;s-hou&s;e appears between two
<PB N="345" REF="343">
large clumps of trees, at about the di&s;tance of
four miles: The gla&s;s-hou&s;es in this country not
ill re&s;embling a di&s;tant pyramid. A&s;cending to
the next &s;eat, which is in the gothic form, the
&s;cene grows more and more extended; woods
and lawns, hills and vallies, thicket and plain,
agreeably intermingled. On the back of this
&s;eat is the following beautiful in&s;cription, which
the author told me that he cho&s;e to fix here, to
&s;upply what he thought &s;ome want of life in this
part of the farm, and to keep up the &s;pectator's
attention till he came to &s;cale the hill beyond.</P>

<Q>&startq;To all friends round the Wrekin!&endq;</Q>
This facetious in&s;cription, being an old Shrop|&s;hire
health, is a commemoration of his country
friends, from which this part of Shrop&s;hire is di|vided.
Add to this, that the Wrekin, that large
and venerable hill, appears full in front at the
di&s;tance of about thirty miles.</P>
<P>THE &s;cene is a very fine one, divided by the
firs into &s;everal compartiments, each an&s;wering
to the octagonal &s;eat in the center, to each of
which is allotted a competent number of &s;triking
objects to make a complete picture. A long &s;er|pentine
&s;tream wa&s;hes the foot of this hill, and is
lo&s;t behind trees at one end, and a bridge thrown
over at the other. Over this the eye is carried
from very romantic home &s;cenes to very beauti|ful
<PB N="349" REF="347">
ones at a di&s;tance. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give an
idea of that immen&s;e variety, that fine configu|ration
of parts, which engage our attention from
this place. In one of the compartiments you
have a &s;imple &s;cene of a cottage, and a road
winding behind a farm-hou&s;e half covered with
trees upon the top of &s;ome wild &s;loping ground;
and in another a view of the town, appearing
from hence as upon the &s;helving banks of a large
piece of water in the flat. Suffice it to &s;ay,
that the hill and vale, plain and woodland, vil|lages
and &s;ingle hou&s;es, blue di&s;tant mountains
that &s;kirt the horizon, and green hills romanti|cally
jumbled that form the intermediate ground,
make this &s;pot more than commonly &s;triking&mdash;nor
is there to be &s;een an acre of level ground
through the large extent to which, the eye is
carried.</P>
<P>HENCE the path winds on betwixt two &s;mall
benches, each of which exhibits a plea&s;ing land|&s;kip,
which cannot e&s;cape the eye of a con|noi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>HERE we wind through a (N&deg; 19) &s;mall
thicket, and &s;oon enter a cavity in the hill, filled
with trees, in the center of which is a &s;eat, from
whence is di&s;covered, gleaming acro&s;s the trees,
<PB N="350" REF="348">
a con&s;iderable length of the &s;erpentine &s;tream
before-mentioned, running under a &s;light ru&s;tic
bridge to the right. Hence we a&s;cend in a kind
of Gothic (N&deg; 20) alcove, looking down a &s;lope,
&s;ided with large oaks and tall beeches, which
together over-arch the &s;cene. On the back of this
building is found the following</P>

BELOW this alcove is a large &s;loping lawn finely
bounded, cro&s;&s;ed by the &s;erpentine water before|mentioned,
and inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ingle, or
clumps of oaks at agreeable di&s;tances. Further
on, the &s;cene is finely varied; the hills ri&s;ing and
falling towards the oppo&s;ite concavities, by the
&s;ide of a long winding vale, with the mo&s;t grace|ful
confu&s;ion. Among other &s;cenes that form
this land&s;kip, a fine hanging wood, backed and
contra&s;ted with a wild heath, inter&s;ected with
cro&s;s roads, is a very con&s;iderable object. Near
adjoining to this, is a &s;eat from whence the water
is &s;een to advantage in many different &s;tages of
it's progre&s;s: Or where (as a poetical friend once
ob&s;erved) the proprietor has taken the Naiad by
the hand, and led her an irregular dance into
the valley.</P>
<P>PROCEEDING hence through a (N&deg; 21) wicket,
we enter upon another lawn, beyond which is a
new theatre of wild &s;haggy precipices, hanging
coppice ground, and &s;mooth round hills between,
being not only different, but even of an oppo&s;ite
character to the ground from which we pa&s;&s;ed.
Walking along the head of this lawn, we come
to a (N&deg; 22) &s;eat under a &s;preading beech, with
this

<P>IN the center of the hanging lawn before you,
is di&s;covered the hou&s;e, half hid with trees and
bu&s;hes. A little hanging wood, and a piece of
winding water, i&s;&s;ues through a noble clump of
large oaks and &s;preading beeches. At the di|&s;tance
of about ten or twelve miles Lord Stam|ford's
grounds appear, and beyond the&s;e the
Clee Hills in Shrop&s;hire. The &s;cene here con|&s;i&s;ts
of admirably varied ground, and is, I think, a
very fine one. Hence pa&s;&s;ing &s;till a-long the top
of the lawn, we cro&s;s another gate, and behind
the fence begin to de&s;cend into the valley.
About half way down is a (N&deg; 23) &s;mall bench,
which throws the eye upon a near &s;cene of hang|ing
woods and &s;haggy wild declivities, inter|mixt
with &s;mooth green &s;lopes and &s;cenes of cul|tivation.</P>
<P>WE now return again into the great lawn at
bottom, and &s;oon come to a (N&deg; 24) &s;eat, which
<PB N="354" REF="352">
gives a nearer view of the water before-men|tioned,
between the trunks of high over-&s;ha|dowing
oaks and beeches; beyond which the
winding line of trees is continued down the val|ley
to the right. To the left at a di&s;tance
the top of Clent Hill appears, and the houfe
upon a &s;well, amid&s;t trees and bu&s;hes. In the
center, the eye is carried by a &s;ideling view down
a length of lawn, till it re&s;ts upon the town and
&s;pire of Hales, with &s;ome picture&s;que and beau|tiful
ground ri&s;ing behind it.</P>
<P>SOMEWHAT out of the path, and in the

<P>We now through a &s;mall gate enter what is
called the Lover's (N&deg; 26) Walk, and proceed
immediately to a &s;eat where the water is &s;een
very advantageou&s;ly at full length; which,
<PB N="355" REF="353">
though not large, is &s;o agreeably &s;haped, and
has it's bounds &s;o well concealed, that the be|holder
may receive le&s;s plea&s;ure from many lakes
of greater extent. The margin on one &s;ide is
fringed with alders, the other is over-hung with
mo&s;t &s;tately oaks and beeches, and the middle
beyond the water pre&s;ents the Hales Owen
&s;cene, with a group of hou&s;es on the &s;lope be|hind,
and the hori&s;on well fringed with the wood.
Now winding a few paces round the margin of
the water, we come to another &s;mall bench,
which pre&s;ents the former &s;cene &s;omewhat va|ried,
with the addition of a whited village among
trees upon a hill: Proceeding on, we enter the
plea&s;ing gloom of this agreeable walk, and
come to a (N&deg; 27) bench beneath a &s;preading
beech that over-hangs both walk and water,
which has been called the A&s;&s;ignation &s;eat, and
has this in&s;cription on the back of it.</P>
<Q><L>Nerine Galatea! thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae,</L>

<P>Here the path begins gradually to a&s;cend beneath
a depth of &s;hade, by the &s;ide of which is a &s;mall
bubbling rill, either forming little penin&s;ula's,
<PB N="356" REF="354">
rolling over pebbles, or falling down &s;mall ca&s;|cades,
all under cover, and taught to murmur
very agreeably. This very &s;oft and pen&s;ive
&s;cene, very properly &s;tiled the Lover's Walk, is
terminated with an ornamented (N 28) urn, in&s;cribed
to Mi&s;s Dolman, a beautiful and amiable relation
of Mr. Shen&s;tone's, who died of the &s;mall-pox,
about twenty-one years of age, in the following

<P>THE a&s;cent from hence winds &s;omewhat more
&s;teeply to another (N&deg; 29) &s;eat, where the eye
is thrown over a rough &s;cene of broken and furzy
ground; upon a piece of water in the flat, who&s;e
extremities are hid behind trees and &s;hrubs, among&s;t
which the hou&s;e appears, and makes upon the whole
<PB N="357" REF="355">
no unplea&s;ing picture. The path &s;till winds un|der
cover up the hill, the &s;teep declivity of
which is &s;omewhat ea&s;ed by the &s;erpentine &s;weep
of it, till we come to a &s;mall bench with this
line from Pope's Eloi&s;a;
<Q>&startq;Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!&endq;</Q>
The opening before it pre&s;ents a &s;olitary &s;cene
of trees, thickets, and precipice, and terminates
upon a green hill, with a clump of firs on the
top of it.</P>
<P>WE now find the great u&s;e as well as beauty
of the &s;erpentine path in climbing up this wood.
The fir&s;t &s;eat of which, alluding to the rural
&s;cene before it, has the following lines from
Virgil.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Hic latis otia fundis</L>
<L>Speluncae, vivique lacus, hic frigida Tempe,</L>
<L>Mugitusque boum, mollesque &s;ub arbore &s;omni.</L></Q>
<P>Here the eye looking down a &s;lope beneath the
&s;preading arms of oak and beech trees, pa&s;&s;es
fir&s;t over &s;ome rough furzy ground, then over
water to the large &s;welling lawn, in the center
of which the hou&s;e is di&s;covered among trees
and thickets. This forms the fore ground. Be|yond
<PB N="358" REF="356">
this appears a &s;well of wa&s;te furzy land,
diver&s;ified with a cottage, and a road that winds
behind a farm-hou&s;e, and a fine clump of trees.
The back &s;cene of all is a &s;emicircular range of
hills diver&s;ified with wood, &s;cenes of cultivation,
and enclo&s;ures, to about four or five miles
di&s;tance.</P>
<P>STILL winding up into the wood, we come to
a &s;light &s;eat opening through the trees to a
bridge of five piers, cro&s;&s;ing a large piece of
water at about half a mile's di&s;tance. The next
&s;eat looks down from a con&s;iderable height, along
the &s;ide of a &s;teep precipice, upon &s;ome irregular
and plea&s;ing ground. And now we turn upon a
&s;udden into a long &s;trait lined walk in the wood,
arched over with tall trees, and terminating with
a &s;mall ru&s;tic building. Though the walk, as I
&s;aid, be &s;trait-lined, yet the ba&s;e ri&s;es and falls
&s;o agreeably, as leaves no room to cen&s;ure it's
formality. About the middle of this avenue,
which runs the whole length of this hanging
wood, we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty (N&deg; 30)
gothic &s;eat, whence we look down a &s;lope, more
con&s;iderable than that before-mentioned, through
the wood on each &s;ide. This view is indeed a
fine one: The eye fir&s;t travelling down over
well-variegated ground into the valley, where is
<PB N="359" REF="357">
a large piece of water, who&s;e &s;loping banks give
all the appearance of a noble river. The ground
from hence ri&s;es gradually to the top of Clent
Hill, at three or four miles di&s;tance, and the
land&s;kip is enriched with a view of Hales Owen,
the late Lord Dudley's hou&s;e, and a large wood
of Lord Lyttelton's. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give an
adequate de&s;cription of this view, the beauty of it
depending npon the great variety of objects, and
beautiful &s;hape of ground; and all at &s;uch a
di&s;tance as to admit of being &s;een di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>HENCE we proceed to the (N&deg; 31) ru&s;tic
building before-mentioned, a &s;light and unexpen|&s;ive
edifice, formed of rough unhewn &s;tone, com|monly
called here the Temple of Pan; having a
trophy of the Tibia and Syrinx, and this in&s;crip|tion
over the entrance,
<Q><L>Pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures</L>
<L>Edocuit; Pan curat oves, oviumque magi&s;tros.</L></Q>
Hence mounting once more to the right through
this dark umbrageous walk, we enter at once
upon a light&s;ome high natural terrace, whence
the eye is thrown over all the &s;cenes we have
&s;een before, together with many fine additional
ones, and all beheld from a declivity that ap|proaches
<PB N="360" REF="358">
as near a precipice as is agreeable.
In the middle is a (N&deg; 32) &s;eat with this in|&s;cription:
<Q>DIVINI GLORIA RVRIS!</Q>
To give a better idea of this, by far the mo&s;t
magnificent &s;cene here, it were, perhaps, be&s;t to
divide it into two di&s;tinct parts&mdash;the noble con|cave
in the front, and the rich valley towards
the right&mdash;In regard to the former; if a boon
companion could enlarge his idea of a punch|bowl,
ornamented within with all the romantic
&s;cenery the Chine&s;e ever yet devi&s;ed, it would,
perhaps, afford him the highe&s;t idea he could
po&s;&s;ibly conceive of earthly happine&s;s. He would
certainly wi&s;h to &s;wim in it. Suffice it to &s;ay,
that the hori&s;on, or brim, is as finely varied as
the cavity. It would be idle here to mention the
Clee Hills, the Wrekin, the Wel&s;h Mountains,
or Caer Caradoc, at a prodigious di&s;tance; which
though they fini&s;h the &s;cene agreeably, &s;hould
not be mentioned at the Lea&s;owes, the beauty
of which turns chiefly upon di&s;tingui&s;hable &s;cenes.
The valley upon the right is equally enriched,
and the oppo&s;ite &s;ide thereof well fringed with
woods; and the high hills on one &s;ide this long
winding vale rolling agreeably into the hollows
<PB N="361" REF="359">
on the other. But the&s;e are a kind of objects,
which, though really noble in the &s;urvey, will
not &s;trike a reader in de&s;cription, as they would
a &s;pectator upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>HENCE returning back into the wood, and
cro&s;&s;ing Pan's temple, we go directly down the
&s;lope, into another part of Mr. Shen&s;tone's grounds,
the path leading down through very plea&s;ing
home &s;cenes of well-&s;haped ground, exhibiting a
mo&s;t perfect concave and convex, till we come at
a &s;eat under a noble beech, pre&s;enting a rich
variety of fore-ground, and at, perhaps, half a
mile's di&s;tance, the gothic alcove on a hill well
covered with wood, a pretty cottage under trees
in the more di&s;tant part of the concave, and a
farm-hou&s;e upon the right, all picture&s;que ob|jects.</P>
<P>THE (N&deg; 33) next and the &s;ub&s;equent &s;eat afford
pretty much the &s;ame &s;cenes a little enlarged;
with the addition of that remarkable clump of
trees, called Frankly Beeches, adjoining to the
old family &s;eat of the Lyttelton's, and from
whence the pre&s;ent Lord Lyttelton derives his
title.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="360">
WE come now to an hand&s;ome (N&deg; 34) gothic
&s;creen, backed with a clump of firs, which throws
the eye in front full upon a ca&s;cade in the valley,
i&s;&s;uing from beneath a dark &s;hade of poplars.
The hou&s;e appears in the center of a large
&s;welling lawn, bu&s;hed with trees and thicket.
The plea&s;ing variety of ea&s;y &s;wells and hollows,
bounded by &s;cenes le&s;s &s;mooth and cultivated, af|fords
the mo&s;t delightful picture of dome&s;tic re|tirement
and tranquillity.</P>
<P>WE now de&s;cend to a (N&deg; 35) &s;eat enclo&s;ed
with hand&s;ome pales, and backed with firs, in|&s;cribed
to Lord Lyttelton. It pre&s;ents a beauti|ful
view up a valley contracted gradually, and
ending in a group of mo&s;t magnificent oaks and
beeches. The right hand &s;ide is enlivened with
two &s;triking ca&s;cades, and a winding &s;tream &s;een
at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland.
To the left appears the hanging wood already
mentioned, with the gothic &s;creen on the &s;lope
in the center.</P>
<P>WINDING &s;till downwards, we come to a (N&deg; 36)
&s;mall &s;eat, where one of the offices of the hou&s;e,
and a view of a cottage on very high ground, is
&s;een over the tops of the trees of the grove in the
<PB N="363" REF="361">
adjacent valley, giving an agreeable in&s;tance of the
abrupt inequality of ground in this romantic well|variegated
country. The next (N&deg; 37) &s;eat &s;hews
another face of the &s;ame valley, the water
gliding calmly along betwixt two &s;eeming groves
without any ca&s;cade, as a contra&s;t to the former
one where it was broken by ca&s;cades. The &s;cene
very &s;ignificantly alluded to by the motto:
<Q><L>&startq;Rura mihi, et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes,</L>
<L>Flumina amem, &s;ilvasque inglorius!&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>WE de&s;cend now to a beautiful gloomy &s;cene,
called Virgil's Grove, where on the entrance we
pa&s;s by a &s;mall obeli&s;k on the right hand with
this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>P. VIRGILIO MARONI</L>
<L>LAPIS ISTE CVM LVCO SACER ESTO.</L></Q>
Before this is a &s;light bench, where &s;ome of the
&s;ame objects are &s;een again, but in a different
point of light. It is not very ea&s;y either to paint
or de&s;cribe this delightful grove: however, as
the former has been more than once attempted,
I will hope to apologize for an imperfect de&s;crip|tion,
by the difficulty found by tho&s;e who have
aimed to &s;ketch it with their pencil. Be it, there|fore,
fir&s;t ob&s;erved, that the whole &s;cene is opake
<PB N="364" REF="362">
and gloomy, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall deep valley or
dingle; the &s;ides of which are inclo&s;ed with irre|gular
tufts of hazel and other underwood; and
the whole over-&s;hadowed with lofty trees ri&s;ing
out of the bottom of the dingle, through which
a copious &s;tream makes it's way through mo&s;&s;y
banks, enamelled with prim ro&s;es, and variety of
wild wood flowers. The (N&deg; 38) fir&s;t &s;eat we
approach is thus in&s;cribed,
<Q>CELEBERRIMO POETAE

<L>Saxo&s;as inter decurrunt flumina valles.</L></Q>
This &s;eat is placed upon a &s;teep bank on the edge
of the valley; from which the eye is here drawn
down into the flat below, by the light that glim|mers
in front, and by the &s;ound of various ca&s;|cades,
by which the winding &s;tream is agreeably
broken. Oppo&s;ite to this &s;eat the ground ri&s;es
again in an ea&s;y concave to a kind of dripping
<PB N="365" REF="363">
fountain, where a &s;mall rill trickles down a rude
nich of rock work, through fern, liverwort, and
aquatick weeds. The green area in the middle
through which the &s;tream winds, being as well
&s;haped as can be imagined. After falling down
the&s;e ca&s;cades, it winds under a bridge of one
arch, and then empties it&s;elf into a &s;mall lake
which catches it a little below. This terminates
the &s;cene upon the right, and after the&s;e objects
have for &s;ome time amu&s;ed the &s;pectator, his
eye rambles to the left, where one of the mo&s;t
beautiful ca&s;cades imaginable is &s;een by way of
incident, through a kind of vi&s;ta, or glade, falling
down a precipice over-arched with trees, and
&s;trikes us with &s;urprize. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s
the plea&s;ure which one feels on this occa&s;ion, for
though &s;urprize alone is not excellence, it may
&s;erve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful.
I believe none ever beheld this grove, without a
thorough &s;en&s;e of &s;atisfaction; and were one to
chu&s;e any one particular &s;pot of this perfectly Ar|cadian
farm, it &s;hould, perhaps, be this; although
it &s;o well contra&s;ts both with the terrace and with
&s;ome other &s;cenes, that one cannot wi&s;h them ever
to be divided. We now proceed to a &s;eat at the
bottom of a large root on the &s;ide of a &s;lope, with
this in&s;cription,

THE view from it is a calm tranquil &s;cene of
water, gliding through &s;loping ground, with a
&s;ketch through the trees of the &s;mall pond be|low.</P>
<P>THE &s;cene in this place is that of water &s;teal|ing
along through a rude &s;eque&s;tered vale, the
ground on each &s;ide covered with weeds and field|flowers,
as that before is kept clo&s;e-&s;haven. Farther
on we lo&s;e all &s;ight of water, and only hear the
noi&s;e, without having the appearance; a kind of
effect which the Chine&s;e are fond of producing
in what they call their &s;cenes of enchantment.
We now turn all on a &s;udden upon the high
ca&s;cade which we admired before in vi&s;ta. The
&s;cene around is quite a grotto of native &s;tone
running up it, roots of trees over-hanging it,
and the whole &s;haded over head. However, we
fir&s;t approach upon the left a chalybeat &s;pring,
with an iron bowl chained to it, and this in&s;crip|tion
a &s;tone,
<Q>FONS FERRVGINEVS
DIVAE QVAE SECESSV ISTO FRVI CONCEDIT.</Q>
Then turning to the right, we find a &s;tone &s;eat
making part of the afore&s;aid cave, with this
well-applied in&s;cription,
<Q><PB N="368" REF="366">
<L>INTVS AQVAE DVLCIS, VIVOQVE SEDILIA SAXO;</L>
<L>NYMPHARVM DOMVS.</L></Q>
Which I have often heard Mr. Shen&s;tone term
the definition of a grotto. We now wind up a
&s;hady path on the left hand, and cro&s;&s;ing the
head of this ca&s;cade, pa&s;s be&s;ide the river that
&s;upplies it, in bur way up to the hou&s;e. One
&s;eat fir&s;t occurs under a &s;hady oak as we a&s;cend
the hill; &s;oon after, we enter the &s;hrubbery
which half &s;urrounds the hou&s;e, where we find
two &s;eats thus in&s;cribed, to two of his mo&s;t par|ticular
friends. The fir&s;t thus,
<Q><L>AMICITIAE ET MERITIS</L>
<L>RICHARDI GRAVES:</L>
<L>IPSAE TE, TITYRE, PINVS,</L>
<L>IPSI TE FONTES, IPSA HAEC ARBVSTA VOCABANT.</L></Q>
And a little further the other, with the following
in&s;cription,
<Q><L>AMICITIAE ET MERITIS</L>
<L>RICHARDI JAGO.</L></Q>
From this la&s;t is an opening down the valley
over a large &s;liding lawn, well edged with oaks,
to a piece of water cro&s;&s;ed by a con&s;iderable
<PB N="369" REF="367">
bridge in the flat&mdash;the &s;teeple of Hales, a vil|lage
amid trees, making on the whole a very

&s;hrubs, be&s;ide a menagerie for doves, we
are conducted to the &s;tables. But let it not be
forgot, that on the entrance into this &s;hrubbery,
the fir&s;t object that &s;trikes us is a Venus de Medi|cis,
