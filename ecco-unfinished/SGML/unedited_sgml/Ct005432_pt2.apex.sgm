<P>ABELARD and Eloi&s;a flouri&s;hed in the twelfth Century; they were two of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed per&s;ons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfor|tunate pa&s;&s;ion. After a long cour&s;e of calamities, they retired each to a &s;everal Convent, and con&s;e|crated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this &s;eparation, that a letter of Abe|lard's to a Friend, which contained the hi&s;tory of his misfortune, fell into the hands of Eloi&s;a. This awakening all her tenderne&s;s, occa&s;ioned tho&s;e cele|brated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted) which give &s;o lively a picture of the &s;truggles of grace and nature, virtue and pa&s;&s;ion. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></P>

<P>OEDIPUS King of Thebes having by mi&s;take &s;lain his father Laius, and marry'd his mother Joca&s;ta; put out his own eyes, and re&s;ign'd the realm to his &s;ons, Eteocles and Polynices. Being neglected by them, he makes his prayer to the fury Ti&s;iphone, to &s;ow debate betwixt the brothers. They agree at la&s;t to reign &s;ingly, each a year by turns, and the fir&s;t lot is obtain'd by Eteocles. Jupiter, in a council of the Gods, declares his re&s;olution of puni&s;hing the Thebans, and Argives al&s;o, by means of a marriage betwixt Poly|nices and one of the daughters of Adra&s;tus King of Ar|gos. Juno oppo&s;es, but to no effect; and Mercury is &s;ent on a me&s;&s;age to the &s;hades, to the gho&s;t of Laius, who is to appear to Eteocles, and provoke him to break the agreement. Polynices in the mean time departs from Thebes by night, is overtaken by a &s;torm, and ar|rives at Argos; where he meets with Tydeus&punc; who had fled from Calydon, having kill'd his brother. Adra&s;tus entertains them, having receiv'd an oracle from Apollo that his daughters &s;hould be marry'd to a Boar and a Lion, which he under&s;tands to be meant of the&s;e &s;tran|gers by whom the hides of tho&s;e bea&s;ts were worn, and who arriv'd at the time when he kept an annual fea&s;t in honour of that God. The ri&s;e of this &s;olemnity he re|lates to his gue&s;ts, the loves of Phoebus and P&s;amathe, and the &s;tory of Choroebus. He enquires, and is made acquainted with their de&s;cent and quality: The &s;acrifice is renew'd, and the book concludes with a Hymn to Apollo.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator hopes he needs not apologize for his Choice of this piece, which was made almo&s;t in his Childhood. But finding the Ver&s;ion better than he expected, he gave it &s;ome Correction a few years afterwards.</P>
