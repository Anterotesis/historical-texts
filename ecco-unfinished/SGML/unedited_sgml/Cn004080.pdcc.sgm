<P N="1">1. And now it was, and indeed not till now, that I had all my Evidence at once before me, and that I was able to affirm, and a&s;&s;uredly pronounce, That the <HI>Arian</HI> Doctrine was in the&s;e Points, <HI>viz.</HI> The Trinity and Incarnation, mo&s;t certainly the Origi|nal Doctrine of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, of his Holy Apo&s;tles, and of the mo&s;t Primitive Chri&s;tans, as in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, <HI>Page</HI> 6 and 7, <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Scriptures &s;peak of One God, they mean thereby One Supream God the Father only, as in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, <HI>Page</HI> 81. <HI>Refe|rendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Moderns call'd the&s;e Three Divine Per&s;ons, but one God, and &s;o introduced at lea&s;t a New and Un&s;criptural and Inaccurate, if not fal&s;e way of &s;peaking into the Church&mdash;Errata, <HI>Page</HI> 123, <HI>Line</HI> 23, 24.

<P>The&s;e I allow to be my own Words, and to be agreeable to my own not uncertain Opinion, but certain Faith. I was once, as the World will &s;ee by the occa&s;ion of the latter <HI>Erratum</HI>, in the com|mon Opinion, That the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, the Three Divine Powers, [Per&s;ons] were truly in &s;ome Sence One God, or the One God of the Chri|&s;tian Religion; that is, before I particularly Exa|min'd that Matter in the Scriptures, and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers: but &s;ince I have thoroughly In|quired into it, I am &s;o fully &s;atisfied that the Father alone is the One God of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that
<PB N="5" REF="8">
I mu&s;t now own, that when once I deny or doubt of that Doctrine, I mu&s;t deny or doubt of our com|mon Chri&s;tianity: there being no one Article more plain, or more univer&s;ally acknowledg'd in all the fir&s;t Ages of the Church than that was: As in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, <HI>page</HI> 81. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Son is Inferior as well as Subordinate to the Father; as in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, Po&s;. 3. <HI>page</HI> 65. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Son was Begotten or Created by the Father, only before the World, whatever &s;ecret Eternity he had before his Generation or Creation: As in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, Po&s;. 7. <HI>page</HI> 65. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Word and Son of God, is a Divine Being, a [or] Per&s;on far Inferiour to his Father in Nature, Attributes and Perfections: As in the Reply to Dr. <HI>Allix</HI>, Propo&s;ition 8. <HI>page</HI> 30. <HI>Refe|rendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>

<P N="7">7. The Holy Spirit of God is a Divine Per&s;on made under the Supream God by our Saviour, or, in a due Sence, proceeding from the Father and the Son, of different Perfections and Offices from the Son of God. As in the Reply to Dr. <HI>Alix</HI>, Propo|&s;ition 19. <HI>page</HI> 33. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. Since your Lord&s;hip is &s;o thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the Anti-Chri&s;tiani&s;m of Popery, I would fain know how the Con&s;ub&s;tantiality and Coequality of the Holy Gho&s;t to the Father and the Son, on which &s;oon followed his Invocation; which only &s;tands upon one Letter of Pope <HI>Liberius</HI> or <HI>Dama&s;us</HI>, can by your Lord&s;hip be looked upon under any other Denomination: As in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, <HI>page</HI> 28. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="6" REF="9">9. This Language (To Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, One God, whom we Adore) is &s;o intirely contrary to the Nature of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that I cannot go into it for any Con&s;ideration what|&s;oever: As in the Appendix to the Hi&s;torical Pre|face, <HI>Page</HI> 5, 6. <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="10">10. I allow that the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit is to be Wor|&s;hipped in the&s;e Forms, <HI>viz.</HI> Bapti&s;m, Doxology, and Ble&s;&s;ing, but never by Invocation: As in the &s;aid Hi&s;torical Preface, <HI>page</HI> 46 <HI>Referendo</HI>, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton's</HI> DEFENCE of Him&s;elf, from Dr. <HI>PELLING</HI>'s Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I come to the particular Vindica|tion of my &s;elf from that Accu&s;ation of He|re&s;y, which Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> has laid before this High-Court again&s;t me, and which has been admit|ted as Chargeable upon me; I beg leave to Premi&s;e &s;everal Things by way of Preparation, in order to the clearer Under&s;tanding of the whole Matter, and to the more full Di&s;covery of my real Notions, and to the making my Apology more clear and com|pleat; which I &s;hall compri&s;e under the Heads or Ob&s;ervations following,</P>
<P N="1">I. I take it for granted that <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, is &s;omewhat different from Mi&s;take or <HI>Error</HI>, and that it is of a more Heinous Nature, requires a different Treat|ment, and a &s;orer Puni&s;hment; and that it is mate|rially a Denial or Corruption of &s;ome of the Prima|ry
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and Fundamental Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion; and that it is formally a Criminal and Wicked Denyal or Corruption of the &s;ame, <HI>i.e.</HI> that it mu&s;t be in Points of Principal Concern to Chri&s;tianity, &s;uch as affect its very Foundations, which I think is allow'd by all; and that it mu&s;t not be an Involuntary or Innocent Mi&s;take, or Error of the Judgment only, but &s;till joined with &s;ome Criminal or Wicked Di|&s;po&s;ition of the Will al&s;o. This la&s;t is evident by all tho&s;e places of the known Books of the <HI>New Testa|ment</HI>, wherein the Term <HI>Here&s;y</HI> or <HI>Heretick</HI> in any &s;uch Sen&s;e are us'd, which are indeed but Four. The Fir&s;t is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 19. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>There mu&s;t be Here&s;ies among you, that they that are approved may be made manife&s;t among you.</HI> Here 'tis evident that there is a Crime of the Will, a Wickedne&s;s of Di&s;po|&s;ition in even the lea&s;t degrees of Schi&s;m and Here|&s;y (for of &s;uch &s;maller Divi&s;ions and Parties among Chri&s;tians, the Word &s;eems here to be u&s;ed only;) otherwi&s;e the avoiding of the &s;ame would not be a Trial of Men's Goodne&s;s and Sincerity.

the bare Mi&s;take of the Judgment, but of the Wickedne&s;s of the Will, and of acting again&s;t the Light of Con&s;cience al&s;o. The Fourth is 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1.

<P N="2">II. I Ob&s;erve that what was direct and formal Here&s;y, in the fir&s;t Ages, may not always be &s;o now; and that by Con&s;equence &s;ome of the &s;ame fal&s;e Doctrines which would at fir&s;t have been Ju&s;tly E&s;teem'd plainly Heretical, and de&s;erve Excommu|nication, may now rather be Pardonable Mi&s;takes, requiring calm Debates; and in&s;tead of further Pun|i&s;hment, a <HI>Re&s;toration in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s</HI>. The Rea&s;on of this Ob&s;ervation is evident; <HI>viz.</HI> That in the fir&s;t Ages all true Chri&s;tians, the Sin|cere followers of Chri&s;t, were fully In&s;tructed by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or their known Compan|ions, being Apo&s;tolical Men; or at lea&s;t by their

near Succe&s;&s;ors, the Primitive Bi&s;hops and Presby|ters; they could then mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h between Apo&s;tolical Churches, and Heretical A&s;&s;emblies; between the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Peter, Paul, James, Cle|ment, Polycarp</HI>, and the like, on one Side; and the followers of <HI>Simon</HI> the Magician, <HI>Cerinthus, Valen|tinus, Marcion</HI>, the Gno&s;ticks, and the like, on the other; between the Holy, Divine, Pure and Hea|venly Doctrines, with the Spiritual Offices, and &s;trict Di&s;cipline of the Chri&s;tian Churches, on one &s;ide; and the Wicked, Diabolical, Impure, and Sen|&s;ual Po&s;itions, the profane Ceremonies, and carele&s;s Behaviour of the Heretical Societies, on the other: Between following the Conduct of In&s;pired Per&s;ons on the one hand, and re&s;igning them&s;elves up to the Direction of gro&s;s Enthu&s;iasts, or errand Deceivers on the other. So that little then but an hone&s;t Mind, a De&s;ire of Truth, and Love of Goodne&s;s, was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Men in the Catholick Faith, Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline; I mean this as to all the con|cerning and Fundamental Principles of Chri&s;tianity. But, ala&s;s! that is not always the ca&s;e in the&s;e later and corrupter Ages of the Church! Primitive Faith Piety, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline are not now &s;o vi&s;ible; nor have we any Spiritual Guides really In&s;pired or Apo&s;tolical among us. All things are run into Di&s;order, into Party and Faction, Schi&s;ms and Here&s;ies. Almo&s;t every Body of Men that can get Temporal Authority, or even Toleration on their Side, do now, without all Commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles, pretend to E&s;tabli&s;h their own Noti|ons and Rules, their own Sy&s;tems and Schemes, their own Creeds and Catechi&s;ms, their own Arti|cles of Faith and Eccle&s;iastical decrees for Practice; and the&s;e not Seldom, which is mo&s;t deplorable, as the real Faith of Chri&s;t, and Laws of the Go&s;pel; and &s;o directly <HI>teach for doctrines the command|ments of men</HI>. Matt. XV. 9 If any one happens

to be born in <HI>Italy, Spain, or Portugal</HI>, he mu&s;t either own the Infallibility of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>, with her Bi&s;hop; either believe and live as the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> has decreed, or he can hardly claim the name of a Chri&s;tian. That of Heretick to be &s;ure is thought one of the proper terms of re|proch for him. If you are educated in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Germany</HI>, you mu&s;t follow <HI>Luther</HI>, or you are not in a much better condition. If in others, you mu&s;t allow of <HI>Calvin</HI> as your Guide, or el&s;e very hard thoughts will be entertained of you. If you are a native of <HI>Scotland</HI>, you will frequently be almo&s;t oblig'd to Submit not only to the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Scheme of Doctrine, but to the Presbyterian Form of Church Goverment al&s;o; or el&s;e your Reputation will be in great Danger with many. And if Pro|vidence has ca&s;t any ones Lot into this our native Country, where almo&s;t all other conveniences for ea&s;e and liberty are to be found, and where our famous Church of <HI>England</HI> has a legal E&s;tabli&s;hment, yet will he find matters not very much better as to our Old pure and primitive Religion. Nor can I per|ceive the utmo&s;t care in Examination, the greate&s;t Sincerity in Profe&s;&s;ion, the faire&s;t Addre&s;&s;es to the Learned for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the mo&s;t ready Compliance in all things where Con&s;cience does not forbid, the heartie&s;t Zeal for all that is Good and Valuable, and the mo&s;t Con&s;tant readine&s;s to hear original Evi|dence and &s;ubmit to it, to recal and retract all mis|takes and errors, to give or receive Satisfaction, is even here any &s;ecurity for a Chri&s;tian; unle&s;s he will comply with the 39 Articles of Religion there|in E&s;tabli&s;h'd at the Infancy of the Reformation, as the Rule of his Faith; or rather the Rule of his open Profe&s;&s;ion, whatever his real Faith be; as well as with the other legal Settlements as to Wor&s;hip, Goverment, and Practice among us. But he who after the mo&s;t Impartial Enquires, and the fulle&s;t

Satisfaction thereupon &s;hall endeavour to correct the plaine&s;t Errors and Deviations of the Church from the mo&s;t primitive Settlements; without the lea&s;t de&s;ign of Introducing &s;o much as one Novel, or He|retical, or even uncertain Doctrine, Expre&s;&s;ion, or Practice into the Publick Forms of Religion, &s;hall yet be Stigmatiz'd with the reproachful name of an Heretick, and &s;hall perhaps be Vehemently Pro&s;e|cuted in a Legal Court, with the direct Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y: and this in matters of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence, and before any Solemn Examination of them, or &s;o much as the appointment of one Com|mittee of Learned Men to con&s;ider about them. And can we now Suppo&s;e that in the&s;e latter, di|&s;tracted Ages, where every party educate their Chil|dren in their own notions, and have their Champions ready to colour over their own Errors, and to per|&s;uade the people that they are Chri&s;tian Truths; nay and where every Party, whenever the State encourages them, have al&s;o Rewards and Prefer|ments, Applau&s;e and Reputation, for tho&s;e that do &s;o; as al&s;o have Laws and Courts, Tribunals and Penalties to Affright others from any Oppo&s;ition. Can we, I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e that the very &s;ame Errors, are always equally Criminal in this as in the former Ca&s;e? Can it be as Impious a thing to deny what may be on|ly the Doctrine of &s;ome modern Councils or Synods, as tho&s;e of Chri&s;t him&s;elf? or as pernicious to Mens Souls to call in que&s;tion a meerly Human, as to di&s;|pute Apo&s;tolical and In&s;pired Authority? This certainly cannot be Ju&s;tified upon any Foundation of Religion or Chri&s;tianity. And as it has ju&s;tly been a Que&s;tion, wheither the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which was at fir&s;t irremi&s;&s;ible, as being in Oppo&s;ition to plainly &s;acred and divine Authority, confirmed by undoubted Miracles, be &s;o now; or indeed whether &s;o long after the Days of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and &s;o long after the cea&s;ing of tho&s;e

Miraculous powers, it can be committed by any; So do I think it de&s;erves to be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether tho&s;e which are now u&s;ually Suppos'd to be Hereticks, that is tho&s;e which teach what the modern &s;ettled Churches call Here&s;y, even tho' we really &s;uppo&s;e them materially guilty, are to be treated as the undoubted Hereticks of the fir&s;t ages de&s;ervedly were. And the Rea&s;ons are plain, that again&s;t &s;uch Here&s;ies the evidence is not now always the &s;ame; and that the mo&s;t upright, hone&s;t, and unbia&s;s'd minds may not now be always able to di&s;cover and avoid them. This ob&s;ervation I am very confident de&s;erves much more regard in this and in many other ca&s;es, than the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h'd Churches are willing to allow it: nor &s;hould I ea&s;ily think it proper to make it here before you, were I not re&s;olv'd to &s;peak my real Sentiments as clearly and openly here, as I have Endeavour'd to do it el&s;ewhere. And I heartily wi&s;h that this my open plainne&s;s and Sincerity may not be Offen&s;ive in this Court on Earth, as I am well a&s;&s;ur'd it will not be in the Court of Heaven. Or if it be Offen&s;ive here I &s;hall comfort my &s;elf, I hope, more with the A&s;&s;urance I have of the Ap|probation of the one, than be Afflicted with the Fears I may be under from the Cen&s;ures of the other. But to proceed.</P>
<P N="3">III. I Ob&s;erve, in Order to my own direct Vin|dication from the pre&s;ent Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y even materially con&s;ider'd, That I have taken the be&s;t methods that I knew of for avoiding the lea&s;t tin|cture of any Errors of Here&s;y what&s;oever; I mean I have endeavour'd to take all my notions in the&s;e important matters, not from any later Opinions; not from Metaphy&s;icks or Philo&s;ophy; not from human Decrees and Con&s;titutions; but from all the Original Sacred and Primitive Records of Chri&s;t, of his Apo&s;tles, and of their fir&s;t Followers; and
<PB N="19" REF="21">
have conform'd my own Notions and Practice as intirely as po&s;&s;ible thereto. I have followed neither the Here&s;y of the Old <HI>Ebionites</HI>, nor modern <HI>Soci|nians</HI>: Neither the ra&s;h Notions and Language of <HI>Tertullian</HI>, nor of any of the <HI>Montani&s;ts</HI> his Parti&s;ans, neither the Novel Doctrines and Expre&s;&s;i|ons of <HI>Arius</HI>, or of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>; or of either of their particular Di&s;ciples; All which I knew might mi&s;lead and deceive me; But I had alone regard to the mo&s;t ancient Rule of Faith, or Bapti&s;mal Profe&s;|&s;ion, as it's Sub&s;tance at lea&s;t, if not it's very Words, are all along Deliver'd down to us by &s;o many of the Ancient Chri&s;tians; to the known Sacred and Canonical Books of the New Te&s;tament, &s;till pre&s;erv'd among us; to all the other Original Writings now Extant of the Apo&s;tles or Apo&s;tolical Men, own'd for &s;uch by the ancient Chri&s;tians; and to the undoubted Catholick Records of the three fir&s;t, and former part of the fourth Centuries of the Church. From hence, and alone from hence, without any prejudice for <HI>Appollinarius, Eunomius, Macedonius</HI>, or other the like later Writers, did I draw tho&s;e Doctrines and Rules by which I have Endeavour'd ever &s;ince to guide my Faith and Pra|ctice, and which I have &s;et down in my &s;everal Wri|tings. Of the&s;e I Judged as impartially and upright|ly as I was able: From the&s;e I collected the Principal Texts and Te&s;timonies whereon I Re&s;olv'd to de|pend: for the&s;e I laid a&s;ide almo&s;t all the modern Writers of Controver&s;y, as finding them generally unfair, partial, and injudicious; and at the up&s;hot, after the be&s;t Con&s;ideration of things I was Capable of, from the&s;e I did determine my notions about the Trinity and Incarnation; and when I thus had drawn the Ancient Doctrines out of the ancient Books them&s;elves, I put them into di&s;tinct Propo&s;i|tions, and laid them fairly and openly before the Governours of the Church, and &s;ome of it's mo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="22">
Learned Members, in MS. at fir&s;t, and afterward, by Publi&s;hing the &s;ame, before them and the whole Chri&s;tian World, as the evident re&s;ult of my Exami|nation. By this means I fairly and Peaceably pro|pos'd the&s;e matters to the Examination of the Church; and if it &s;hould receive the &s;ame &s;atisfaction that I had met with, to its amendment and correction. This was certainly no more than what every one has leave to do, as to the very Common or Statute Laws of the Land; where upon any Complaints we are allow'd to Repre&s;ent the Inconveniences ari&s;ing from any &s;ettled Cu&s;tom, or Act of Parliament, and to draw up and tender a Bill for it's Abrogation; and this without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of any ill de&s;igns to the publick, or di&s;regard to the Laws them&s;elves. yet may every one that Petitions the Parliament, for the alteration of a Civil Law as well be deem'd guilty of Sedition again&s;t the State, as I can be of Di&s;obedience again&s;t the Church, for de&s;iring the Correction of &s;ome of its Con&s;titutions. Now I beg that Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>, or this High Court, will plea&s;e to In|form me what better method I could po&s;&s;ibly take to avoid all real Error and Here&s;y what&s;oever? or what more peaceable method I could take for redre&s;s of mo|dern Errors and Here&s;ies? Could I be &s;ecur'd from Er|ror or Here&s;y by Re&s;igning up my &s;elf to the Deter|mination of later Synods and Councils? No certainly. That had been it &s;elf a great Error, if not Here&s;y al&s;o, in the Opinion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf; who&s;e Doctrine of the fallibility of all Synods and Councils, even the mo&s;t General, is known to all Men; and who&s;e very Reformation &s;uppos'd not only their ab&s;tract fallibility, but that they had not Seldom been grievou&s;ly and Fatally guilty of gro&s;s Errors if not of Notorious Here&s;ies them&s;elves. Could I &s;afely rely upon the Old Canon Law, the Decretals of <HI>Popes</HI>, or the Con&s;titutions of this Church in the Days of Popery; which I find &s;ome
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>'s Councel pretend to be &s;till a Rule to Judge of Here&s;y by, even after our Prote&s;tant Reformation it &s;elf? For certain I could not. That had been a wor&s;e Error, if not Here&s;y al&s;o, in the Opinion of this Church, who&s;e Doctrine of the &s;till greater Fallibility of <HI>Popes</HI>, and the latter Popi&s;h Canons and Con&s;titution, with her Rejection of a great Part of them at the Reformation, and an Act of Parliament to have had the re&s;t review'd, and many more of them directly abrogated, are very well known; which noble Attempt however, to the great grief of all good Prote&s;tants, has never yet been brought to Perfection. Could I then with &s;afety have Recour&s;e to our Book of Canons, to our 39 Articles, to our <HI>Homilies</HI>, to our Common Prayer Book, with it's Creeds and Offices, to &s;ecure my &s;elf from Here&s;y? Surely i could not. This would al&s;$ have been intirely contrary to the whole curre$t o$ our Churches own Doctrine, which allows her &s;elf to be as well as others a fallible Church, &s;ubject to great Errors and Mi&s;takes, nay never pretend; that &s;he is her &s;elf Privileg'd from Here&s;y it &s;elf: and has accor|dingly more than once altered her Notions and &s;acred Offices; and who&s;e mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Members do at this Day look on the Original or mo&s;t Obvious &s;ence of &s;everal of her former Doctrines, tho &s;till &s;ub&s;cribed by Publick authority, to be very uncer|tain, if not directly fal&s;e, as &s;hall be fully proved hereafter. Nor can Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> Ju&s;tly Pretend that I ought not to Judge for my &s;elf in the&s;e Matters, but mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that what the Church has determin'd herein is agreable to the Scriptures and the other Records of our Religion: For this were Intirely to &s;ubvert the Foundations of the Reformation al&s;o; which depends wholly on the exerci&s;e of every ones own Judgment in the Funda|mental points of Religion, and the Duty of adher|ing to what, upon our own Examination appears
<PB N="22" REF="24">
to us to be therein true, and agreeable to the Chri&s;tian Revelation. And I de&s;ire to be informed how Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> comes to know, that my A&s;&s;er|tions are di&s;agreeable to Scripture, to the two fir&s;t General Councils, or even to the Liturgy and Arti|cles of the Church of <HI>England</HI>, as he lays his Charge again&s;t me? Is it not by reading them all, and Comparing them all together, and then Declaring from his own private Judgment, that upon that Compari&s;on he finds they are di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e Rules? and does he not upon that Foundation or upon none at all, attempt to have me Puni&s;hed for the &s;ame as Fal&s;e and Heretical? If Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> may at random accu&s;e me of Here&s;y, meerly from his own private Judgment, I hope I may be allow'd, after a full and compleat enquiry into the&s;e matters, after the mo&s;t frequent and &s;erious peru&s;al of all the Ancient Creeds, all the known Books of the New Te&s;tament, all the other Original remains of the Apo&s;tles and their Companions, all the mo&s;t Primi|tive Catholick Writers, nay of all the earlie&s;t Coun|cils of the Church, to Declare, my own more certain knowledge to the Contrary. Nor ought this Court to be offended with me if I here freely declare my farther Opinion, that not a few of tho&s;e that of late years have pretended to write about the&s;e Im|portant Points, if their notions be compar'd with all the Original Standards of Chri&s;tianity, are plain|ly and evidently, in this material &s;ence, Hereticks al&s;o; and that &s;ometimes &s;o gro&s;ly, that they might with much greater pretence of truth and evidence have been pro&s;ecuted in a legal Court as <HI>Sabellians Trithei&s;ts Ebionites</HI>, or <HI>Montani&s;ts</HI>, than I can be as an <HI>Arian</HI>; as I &s;hall more fully Ob&s;erve hereafter. Only I mu&s;t &s;ay 'tis above mea&s;ure hard that while tho&s;e plain and notorious Here&s;ies, which have an|tiquity &s;o evident again&s;t them, do generally e&s;cape with impunity, if not with reward; the&s;e doctrines,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
which all the truly Learned, even the mo&s;t: preju|dic'd, do allow to have &s;o very much greater pre|tences for them&s;elves in the &s;ame antiquity, &s;hould alone be &s;ingled out, and in a method &s;o uncom|mon, with a violence &s;o unu&s;ual &s;hould be pro&s;ecu|ted before this Court. I &s;hall not venture to a&s;&s;ign any Rea&s;ons for this va&s;t difference; but I believe there are not many of tho&s;e that hear me, and con|&s;ider things impartially, but will ea&s;ily gue&s;s at &s;ome of them without my farther intimation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I Ob&s;erve that however, the Only way to avoid Here&s;y, as to its formal nature, is to bear an hone&s;t mind, a pure intention, and a &s;incere di&s;po|&s;ition for the receiving of truth; to be always ready to hear and inquire after truth; to amend and re|tract errors and mi&s;takes; to &s;earch the Scriptures and Antiquity with impartiality, and without prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; to Examine diligently, to &s;peak openly, to be plain and down right with the World; to endeavour to do the will of God in order to know his Truths; to be di&s;pos'd for Suffer|ing and Per&s;ecution on account of the &s;ame; to beg the divine guidance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in all &s;uch re&s;ear|ches; and to Act up to the &s;incere convictions of Con&s;cience all along, without regard to any other motives, but tho&s;e that afford real evidence and Satisfaction. This Ob&s;ervation is the common voice of rea&s;on and Revelation, the known dictate of Heaven, and the only &s;ecurity again&s;t formal Errors or Here&s;ies: I mean &s;uch as are truly cri|minal, and really de&s;erve Animadver&s;ion and Pu|ni&s;hment, either in this or in another world. So that unle&s;s Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> be fully &s;atisfyed that I am formally and culpably in this &s;ence an Heretick, he has no ju&s;t pretence to Pro&s;ecute me in this or any Court. The known dictate of Nature and Scripture is this, that were there appears to be no
<PB N="24" REF="26">
crime, there ought to be no Puni&s;hment. All Men may err, but no Man is forced to be an Heretick. While we are all fallible Creatures we have none of us any &s;ure Privilege from Error, or even from material He|re&s;y. But while we are Sincere, Hone&s;t, and Upright we are not lyable to dangerous Errors, or Perni|cious Here&s;ies. According I have ob&s;erv'd already that Here&s;y in Scripture and the Earlie&s;t Antiquity is &s;till &s;uppos'd to be join'd with Sin and Wicked|ne&s;s; and that the Mi&s;takes of really good Men were never Repre&s;ented under that Odious Cha|racter. Accordingly it is not a little Remarkable, that &s;ome of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians, who appear to have been rather material than formal Hereticks, as not charg'd with any open Vice or Wickedne&s;s, or any evil de&s;igns like the other, &s;eem to have been di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t by the Ancients, and as <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI>'s Account &s;eems to imply, were own'd rather as Erring Brethren, even while their Error was mo&s;t Zealou&s;ly and indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided; when at the &s;ame time the other formal He|reticks were hardly allow'd by them to be Chri&s;tians at all. Now I de&s;ire Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> to declare what Rea&s;on he has to think any of my Errors, Suppo&s;ing &s;uch they be, to be Voluntary and Criminal, and &s;o to be formally Heretical? I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure this Court, that Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> is one with whom I never have had any acquaintance in my Life; that I never once &s;aw him, &s;o far as I Remember, till he appear'd in this very place as my Pro&s;ecutor, the la&s;t 5th. of <HI>December</HI>, which was above a whole Year after he had been fir&s;t endeavouring el&s;ewere to pro&s;ecute me for Here&s;y. That he has never yet given me either a Private or Publick Admonition about my Suppo&s;ed Mi&s;takes in the&s;e Matters. Nay indeed, I declare that I never heard that he ever particularly Studied the&s;e Points, or made any di&s;tinct Enquiries whether they were Here&s;y or Chri&s;tianity, true or fal;&s;e, before or &s;ince this Pro&s;ecution. So that upon

what ju&s;t Grounds he can go in this Matter, I am wholly a &s;tranger. However, &s;ince I dare Appeal to every one that &s;its as a Judge in this Court, and even to my Pro&s;ecutor, Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> him&s;elf; E&s;pecially to all tho&s;e that are acquainted with me, my Studies, Conduct and Behaviour in this and all other Religious Matters, and above all, to the All-&s;eeing God him&s;elf, the Searcher of Hearts&punc; whe|ther I have ever given &s;ufficient Indications of tho&s;e criminal intentions, or &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns; of tho&s;e corrupt Affections, or unchri&s;tian Behaviour which &s;hould induce any one to begin and carry on &s;uch a Legal Pro&s;ecution again&s;t me. Had I indeed been guilty of Prevarication in the&s;e &s;acred Matters; Had I believed one way, and &s;ub&s;cribed, and preach|ed, and acted another; had I been unfaithful to God and to my own Con&s;cience; and had I endea|vor'd, while I was &s;atisfyed the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Do|ctrines were Heretical, to gain or retain any Prefer|ments in the Church by di&s;&s;embling that Opinion, and playing the Hypocrite before God and Men, there had been &s;ome pretence for an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Admonition; and upon my going on, for the Ex|erci&s;e of farther In&s;tances of Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline upon me: which yet I perceive I had in that Ca&s;e for certain e&s;caped. But now I have dealt &s;incere|ly, hone&s;tly, and openly in the&s;e matters; have ventur'd to examine throughly, to determine by my evidence clearly, to &s;peak plainly, and reprove what I take to be common Errors, Here&s;ies, and Corruptions publickly, before all, as becomes a Chri|&s;tian and a Clergy-man to do; I am for thus doing what I believe to be my duty, and di&s;charging my Con&s;cience Pro&s;ecuted at Law, in order to my Degradation, and Excommunication, and, its civil Con&s;equence, Impri&s;onment: That is, I am directly Pro&s;ecuted for my Con&s;cience, and for my Chri&s;tiani|ty. <HI>I &s;ay directly f$r my Con&s;cience, and for my Chri&s;tia|nity</HI>: For &s;ince I am &s;ure my &s;elf, and hope that all o|thers
<PB N="26" REF="28">
are &s;atisfy'd, that I have done the be&s;t I could to under&s;tand the true Religion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, as it was at fir&s;t Settled by his holy Apo&s;tles; and have fully &s;atisfied my &s;elf of the &s;ame; If after this I be Pro&s;ecuted on that Account, I mu&s;t take leave to &s;ay it again, that it is directly for being a Chri&s;tian, or for preferring what I am &s;atisfied was the original Doctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, before the con|trary Determinations of Men long afterwards: other|wi&s;e I de&s;ire to know how it is Po&s;&s;ible for any Per&s;on whom&s;oever to be Pro&s;ecuted on that Account. For certainly whatever Doctrines are clearly in any ones own Judgment, after a fair and full Examination, Here&s;y, they mu&s;t be &s;o to him, till he is Convinced of the Contrary: and if &s;uch an one &s;hould then out of any Hopes or Fears in this World own &s;uch Doctrines, he would be &s;o far formally an Heretick, or, what is rather wor&s;e, &s;o far an Apo&s;tate from Chri&s;tianity. And whatever Doctrines are Clearly, in &s;uch an ones Judgment, after a fair and full Examination, Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, they mu&s;t be &s;o to him, till he is Convinced of the Contrary: and if he &s;hould then, out of any the like Hopes, or Fears in this World, Di&s;own &s;uch Doctrines, he would al&s;o be &s;o far a Betrayer of the &s;acred Truths of the Go&s;pel, and &s;o far an Apo&s;tate from Chri&s;ti|anity. So that in &s;hort Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> by this Legal Pro&s;ecution for pretended Here&s;y, does his utmo&s;t to oblige me to be a real Heretick, or rather in part an Apo&s;tate from the Chri&s;tian Religion it's &s;elf.</P>
<P N="5">V. I cannot but Complain of the very different Treatment I meet with from Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> in this Court, from what I have el&s;where met with from &s;ome of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t Learned Members of the Church: and after what a different manner Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI> deals with me, from that which others of it's mo&s;t Eminent Governours thought fit
<PB N="27" REF="29">
to do. Here is nothing but Legal Accu&s;ations, Legal Proofs, Legal Pleadings, Legal Sentences. [Nothing of Chri&s;tian Admonition, Friendly Re|proof, Rational Conviction, and Authentick Evi|dence.] I mu&s;t not &s;ay this method is at la&s;t taken, becau&s;e the Church cannot otherwi&s;e an&s;wer me: however this I may Say, and this I will Say, and the Printed Letters long &s;ince extant will bear me out in it, that I have not been thus treated by the Learned, &s;uch as Doctor <HI>Allix</HI>, Doctor <HI>Grabe</HI>, and Doctor <HI>Bradford</HI>. I was not thus treated by the right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hops of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Norwich</HI>. Nay I was not thus treated by our mo&s;t reverend Metropolitans them&s;elves, the pre|&s;ent Lord Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, and the late Lord Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI>. And I cannot but think it very hard, that while the&s;e Important matters were debating among the Learned, and that not without the Permi&s;&s;ion, if not Encour|agement, of both the Metropolitans them&s;elves, that Chri&s;tian Method of Enquiry and Exami|nation &s;hould be &s;ince chang'd into this Method of Law and Pro&s;ecution. However, I beg leave to read at lea&s;t my own fir&s;t Letter to our mo&s;t Reverend Metropolitans, and their An&s;wers to me, which I have here in their Originals; becau&s;e they have been long Publick, and becau&s;e I look upon them as very material in order to the Ju&s;tification of the manner of my own Proceedings, as well as to the Condemnation of the manner of Doctor <HI>Pelling</HI>'s Proceedings again&s;t me.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>May it plea&s;e your GRACE,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Having been lately examining with all the Care, Application, and Impartially I could, the <HI>Original Doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, concerning the ever ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Trinity</HI>, and the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of our Lord and Saviour, both in the New Te&s;tament, and in the mo&s;t Primi|tive Antiquity; and having in that Enquiry ob&s;erv'd, as 'tis very ea&s;y to do, that the Opinions of the <HI>two</HI>, and almo&s;t <HI>three fir&s;t Centuries</HI> were very different from tho&s;e of the Fourth and following ones; I think it my Duty to propo&s;e the Con&s;ideration and Examination of the&s;e Matters to the <HI>Chri&s;tian World</HI>; but more e&s;pecially to the <HI>Prote&s;tant Churches</HI>; becau&s;e they have never yet been examin'd in any publick Manner, either at or &s;ince the <HI>Reformation:</HI> and be|cau&s;e the common Doctrines appear all along to have been &s;etled and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the <HI>See of Rome</HI>, and thence to have been propagated to the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian World. It &s;eems to me plain, that the <HI>Scripture</HI>, the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Fathers</HI>, and, in the main, the <HI>&s;econd Century</HI> do agree in the explication of the&s;e &s;acred Doctrines. Nay even the Body of the Chri|&s;tian Church appears to have been of the &s;ame Opi|nions &s;o low as the <HI>Council of Antioch</HI> it &s;elf, in the latter part of the <HI>third Century</HI>, abating only one or two particular Per&s;ons, (contradicting them&s;elves) and &s;uch Parts of the Church as were under the in|fluence of the <HI>Bi&s;hops of Rome</HI>; who, ever &s;ince the Days of Pope <HI>Victor</HI>, have taken upon them to be the Arbitrators of the&s;e and other Controver&s;ies a|mong Chri&s;tians. I hope your Grace will believe that I am <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;incere</HI> in my <HI>Intentions</HI>; and that if I were not fully convinc'd of the great <HI>Importance</HI> of
<PB N="29" REF="31">
what I have to propo&s;e, I would not trouble your Grace, or the World, in this Matter. I am &s;ure I have no Difficulty upon me in believing <HI>My&s;teries</HI>, when|ever I find them reveal'd by God. Nor have I the lea&s;t De&s;ign to detract from the great Dignity of, or from the Divine Wor&s;hip due to the Son of God, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; on who&s;e <HI>Redemption</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> all my own Hopes of Salvation are en|tirely grounded. But I cannot ea&s;ily believe that the Doctrine of the <HI>Fourth</HI> and following <HI>Centuries</HI>, I mean that which at length prevail'd in them, can be purer than that of the two fir&s;t; that <HI>Vigilius Tap|&s;en&s;is, Athana&s;ius</HI>, or <HI>Councils</HI> them&s;elves can <HI>make Articles of Faith</HI>, or that their <HI>late</HI> Authorities can excu&s;e me, or any hone&s;t Chri&s;tian from examining and embracing that <HI>Original Faith, which was once de|liver'd to the Saints</HI>, and receiv'd in the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel. As to the mo&s;t proper <HI>Method</HI> of pro|po&s;ing the&s;e Matters to the Publick, I &s;hall have the greate&s;t Deference for your Graces Judgment and Directions, and tho&s;e of my Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI>; who, as the principal Guides of this Church, have a ju&s;t Right to be con&s;ulted in Matters of this Nature and Moment. For my own part, I not only <HI>believe</HI>, but <HI>know</HI>, that, for the main, what I affirm to have been the antient Doctrine, is &s;o; having ex|amin'd all the certainly genuine and mo&s;t ancient Books and Fragments hitherto publi&s;h'd. I have al&s;o a pretty compleat <HI>Collection of the Te&s;timonies</HI> by me, and a &s;hort <HI>Chronological Account</HI> by what Steps the Pri|mitive Faith was gradually either alter'd or improv'd till it came to the Model of the Creed of <HI>Vigilius Tap|&s;en&s;is</HI>, the <HI>Standard of Modern Orthodoxy</HI> in the&s;e Mat|ters. So that I think my &s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure prepar'd to give an Authentick Account of the Faith of the <HI>two Fir&s;t Centuries</HI>. Nor do I find any plain Te&s;timonies to be alled'g on the other Side. But then, becau&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="32">
in &s;ome particulars I may ea&s;ily have made Mi&s;takes, or Omi&s;&s;ions; becau&s;e, as a peaceable Member of this Church, I ought to con&s;ult its Unity and Quiet as much as po&s;&s;ible; and becau&s;e, if it may be, I would have this Matter calmly and fairly debated and &s;etled by the Learned, before it comes into the Hands of the Ignorant; Upon all the&s;e Accounts, I humbly propo&s;e it to your Graces Con&s;ideration, what Way I &s;hould take in the particular Manage|ment of this Matter? My own Thoughts are, that it might be convenient to have &s;ome Copies tran|&s;crib'd, or rather a few Printed, for the U&s;e of the Learned. But, if any other Method &s;hall be propos'd which may better attain the &s;ame Ends, I &s;hall very readily comply with it. I am aware that &s;everal political or prudential Con&s;iderations may be alleg'd again&s;t either the doing this <HI>at all</HI>, or at lea&s;t the doing it <HI>now</HI>. But then, If the &s;acred Truths of God mu&s;t be always &s;uppre&s;s'd, and dangerous Corrup|tions never inquired into, till the <HI>Politicians</HI> of this World &s;hould &s;ay it were a <HI>proper Time</HI> to examin and correct them, I doubt it would be long enough e're &s;uch Examination and Correction could be expected in any Ca&s;e. I think my &s;elf plainly <HI>oblig'd</HI> in point of <HI>Duty</HI> to communicate my Collections to be pub|lick Con&s;ideration; and therefore from this <HI>Re&s;oluti|iion</HI> in general no worldly Motives whatever, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;hall di&s;&s;uade me. But, as to the particular Propo&s;itions them&s;elves, when they are &s;ent, your Grace will plea&s;e to look upon them as a &s;ome|what ha&s;tly Account, I do not &s;ay of <HI>mine own</HI> Opi|nions, for <HI>they</HI> are of &s;mall Con&s;ideration, but of the Opinions of the <HI>two fir&s;t Centuries of the Church of Chri&s;t</HI>, ready for all well-grounded Alterations, Cor|rections, and Improvements, if my own farther En|quiries, or the Sugge&s;tions of the Learned, &s;hall make any of them nece&s;&s;ary hereafter.

<SALUTE><HI>Dear Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had the favour of your Letter above a Fortnight ago. I earne&s;tly beg your Pardon for not &s;ooner returning my Thanks to you for it; which I certain|ly had done, had not &s;omething or other continually happen'd when I de&s;ign'd it. I &s;ay returning my Thanks to you for the Civility you expre&s;s to me in that Letter; For as for giving an An&s;wer to it, I profe&s;s I am not able. I mu&s;t own I do by no means approve of the De&s;ign which you tell me in your Letter you are upon; (as thinking that, if you do pur&s;ue it, you will do a great deal more hurt to the Chri&s;tian Religion among us than you will do good;) and being of this Opinion, to be &s;ure I can give you no Advice as to the Method in which you &s;hould make the World acquainted with it; which is that you de&s;ire in your Letter. If I was able to give you any Advice it &s;hould be this, that you would lay a&s;ide this Project, at lea&s;t &s;o long as till you have had opportunity of talking freely about this Matter with your Friends at <HI>London</HI>; which you may have in the Parliament-time, if you will then be &s;o kind as to make a Journey thither. A great many things may be offer'd in Di&s;cour&s;e, for the Conviction of either of the differing Parties which cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily writ in Letters. I my &s;elf now think that I have as great Rea&s;on to believe that it will be a great Sin in you to di&s;turb the Peace and Unity of the Catholick Church, by endeavouring to impo&s;e new Articles of Faith upon us about the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, different from, or contrary to the Definitions of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, as you have to believe that it is your Duty to expo&s;e the <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, as contrary to the common belief for almo&s;t three Centuries of the Primitive Church. But perhaps if you and I
<PB N="33" REF="35">
were to talk of the&s;e Matters together, we &s;hould not part at &s;o wide a difference one from the other. I do &s;incerely profe&s;s that I not only love you, but have a great e&s;teem of your extraordinary Abilities in all the &s;orts of Learning of which you have treated in your Books. And indeed I know no Author who&s;e Works I read with more plea&s;ure than I do yours. and I do likewi&s;e really believe you to be a &s;incere, hone&s;t, and unde&s;igning Man. But then give me leave to add, (for I would de&s;ire that you &s;hould think me an hone&s;t Man al&s;o,) that, if you have any weakne&s;s, it is this, that you are too fond of new Notions, and oftentimes lay too great Stre&s;s upon them; at lea&s;t it appears &s;o to me. Forgive me this Freedom: I dare &s;ay you will; becau&s;e it is the pure Effect of hearty Friend&s;hip and good Will to you. You &s;eem in your Letter to intimate that you have a Collection of your Authorities and Rea&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in order to your De&s;igns already drawn up. If you have a Copy of them by you which you can &s;pare, and would be &s;o kind as to &s;end it down to me, either by the Carrier, or &s;ome other &s;afe Hand, I &s;hould own it as a great Favour; and will re|turn it to you again a&s;&s;oon as I have perus'd it. By this Means I &s;hall be the better able to form a Judg|ment of what you are now de&s;igning; and con&s;e|quently more fit to give my opinion, when I &s;hall have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you. I heartily wi&s;h you all Health and Happine&s;s: and I pray God mo&s;t earne&s;tly to direct you in all your Undertakings, that they may be for his Glory, and the good of his Church.</P>

<P N="6"><PB N="34" REF="36">VI. I cannot but here complain to this Court of the &s;trange manner in which this Accu&s;ation is made, and the unfair way of Collecting the Pa&s;&s;ages ex|cepted again&s;t, and the &s;trange Difficulties I am put upon in this Defence. I have long &s;ince Written and Publi&s;hed, as Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> and his Council mu&s;t very well know, Four intire Volumes, Intituled, <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tianity reviv'd</HI>; be&s;ides other &s;maller and more occa&s;ional Papers afterwards. In tho&s;e Four Volumes, and in tho&s;e chiefly, are my Noti|ons and Opinions fully comprehended, di&s;tincly ex|plain'd, and compleatly &s;upported by the Original Sacred Texts, and by the mo&s;t Primitive Te&s;timo|nies, e&s;pecially for the fir&s;t two Centuries. From tho&s;e certainly ought my Opinions to have been taken; and out of tho&s;e ought any Articles to be objected to me. What I occa&s;ionally wrote before, in an <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>, in order to prepare the World for Enquiry; or in a &s;mall Paper by way of Reply to Dr. <HI>Allix</HI>, ought not certainly now, &s;o long after the Publication of tho&s;e Volumes, to be made u&s;e of to any &s;uch Purpo&s;e. To pick out of Private Letters and Occa&s;ional Papers, ha&s;tily put together at fir&s;t, a few Incoherent Pa&s;&s;ages, to make up a Charge of Here&s;y again&s;t me, after all the 23 Propo&s;itions them&s;elves, with all their Explication and Evidence have been &s;o long made publick, &s;eems to be &s;uch an Unfair and Partial Method of Proce|dure as is unworthy the Encouragement of this Court. E&s;pecially while the compleat Books are taken no notice of in the whole Matter, and all ap|pears as tho' the&s;e &s;mall Pamphlets were the only ones that ever I had Written on the&s;e Subjects. Not to &s;ay al&s;o how injudiciou&s;ly &s;ome of the Articles are laid as Doctrines of mine, which are nothing but Affirmations of Facts, or of the Doctrines of the Primitive Chri&s;tians only. 'Tis true, Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;eems to &s;creen him&s;elf from Imputation in this Ca&s;e, by taking the&s;e, and only the&s;e Articles to Convict me of Here&s;y by, from tho&s;e that the la&s;t Convoca|tion attempted to Cen&s;ure between two and three Years ago. But then, he has not the &s;ame Plea or Excu&s;e for doing &s;o that the Convocation at fir&s;t had. For at that time tho&s;e Volumes were not pub|li&s;hed, and &s;o the Convocation could not make the &s;ame u&s;e of them that Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> might and ought to have done. Tho' it be true withal, that the Convo|cation might have taken the Articles them&s;elves all along out of my Appendix to the Reply to Dr. <HI>Alix</HI>, whence they took a few of them; and that they might have &s;een my intire Papers in MS. al&s;o, before they had pa&s;&s;ed any Cen&s;ure at all, if they had vouch&s;afed to have permitted me to lay them before them at that time. However, I pre&s;ume Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> will not take upon him to act in the way of a Con|vocation; but is bound to the &s;ame &s;trict Rules of Ju&s;tice, Fairne&s;s, Examination and Evidence that I am bound by; and that therefore, had he meant any thorough Conviction of me, he &s;hould have Chal|lenged not a few &s;tragling Pa&s;&s;ges in Preliminary Papers, that had all the way a direct reference to the larger Volumes then preparing for the Pre&s;s, but the intire Series of the Doctrine, as laid down in 23 Articles, and as &s;upported by &s;uch unexceptiona|ble Authority all the way al&s;o. For, give me leave to &s;ay, that Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>, the Promoter, has &s;trange Favour allow'd him in this Court, not only to have &s;uch occa&s;ional and accidental Pa&s;&s;ages admitted as Articles again&s;t me, but to have them admitted without any Proof that they are Heretical, or any offer of &s;uch Proof, or any Sign that either he or his Councel can prove they are &s;o. If I &s;hould go and Accu&s;e Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> of High Trea&s;on; and when I had laid the Accu&s;ation again&s;t him, &s;hould not pretend to &s;hew any Law by which the Facts
<PB N="36" REF="38">
charged were High Trea&s;on, but &s;hould in&s;i&s;t that he was to prove that they were not High Trea&s;on, or el&s;e He mu&s;t be Convicted, I gue&s;s how the Civil Courts would look upon &s;uch an Accu&s;ation and &s;uch an Accu&s;er. Yet is this the very Ca&s;e. I have here certain Occa&s;ional Pa&s;&s;ages picked out of &s;ome Preparatory Imperfect Papers Objected to me as Heretical; while the main Account of my Real Opinions, and of the Rea&s;ons I go upon is omitted; and while the Promoter, who ought to prove tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages to be Heretical, declines it, as indeed a Task much too hard for him; but puts it upon me to prove they are not Heretical. Certainly this is &s;trange procedure, and &s;uch as this Court does not u&s;ually allow of: Tho' &s;uch as I do the more will|ingly acquie&s;ce in, becau&s;e it gives me the much de|&s;ir'd opportunity of laying open my Mind before the Publick, and of &s;hewing to all how Uprightly I have acted, how Cautiou&s;ly I have proceeded in my Exa|mination, and how Undeniable the Evidence is I have gone upon in this whole Matter. Of all which Things I hope to &s;atisfy the Hone&s;t and Impartial by what I intend to lay before this Court, and the World, in the future Cour&s;e of my Defence on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I mu&s;t take leave to profe&s;s here before you and all the World, that how &s;everely &s;oever you re&s;olve to treat me in this Court, I re&s;olve, by the Grace of God, not to be at all bya&s;s'd by this Pro&s;e|cution.

<PB N="37" REF="39">
any Modern Churches, or Parties what&s;oever, &s;o far as I am &s;atisfy'd they are contrary to that Chri&s;tia|nity. And as I &s;incerely promi&s;e &s;eriou&s;ly to Weigh and Con&s;ider whatever Chri&s;tian Motives and Argu|ments you &s;hall lay before me, in the way of Origi|nal Evidence, Sacred Authority, or Primitive Re|cords, for the Conviction of my Judgment, and rea|dily to retract all Errors that &s;hall be di&s;cover'd there|by; &s;o do I as plainly a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall intirely di&s;regard whatever other Terrors or Penalties you &s;hall think fit to make u&s;e of again&s;t me. I thank God <HI>I have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t</HI> as to for&s;ake any part of what I am &s;atisfy'd is his Religion, for fear of either Legal Degradation, or Excommunication, or, its Civil Con&s;equence, Impri&s;onment; which, ble&s;&s;ed be God, are now all that the Law inflicts on any in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; and which, I hope, I &s;hall endeavour, if I be called to it, to undergo with Chri&s;tian Patience and Submi&s;&s;ion. I &s;ay only Legal Degradation and Excommunication; for as to any real Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ure either of De|gradation from the Office of a Presbyter of the Chri|&s;tian Church, or of Excommunication from the &s;ame, I am no way &s;atisfied how a Civil Court, acting by a Civil Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as you mo&s;t certainly are, can have Power to inflict them: Nay, I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;ay that I hope you do not lay any Claim to it. For the only Right Reverend Per&s;on of this whole Court, who&s;e Opinion I directly know in any &s;uch Ca&s;e, is my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI>; who was pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure me with his own Mouth, when he was fir&s;t Nominated to that See, during the Life of a former Bi&s;hop, deprived by a bare Civil Autho|rity, that He would not have accepted of it, had he not had the Con&s;ent of the &s;ame Bi&s;hop him&s;elf: As implying his Di&s;&s;atisfaction with &s;uch a meer Lay-Deprivation of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons. But &s;ince al|mo&s;t all you that &s;it here as my Judges, have known my Thoughts upon this Subject, ever &s;ince I appear'd before you, from that Paper of <HI>Rea&s;ons again&s;t the&s;e

Proceedings</HI>, which I at fir&s;t took the Boldne&s;s to pre&s;ent you with, I &s;hall enlarge no farther upon it; but only beg of you to Con&s;ider well of every &s;tep of this important Matter, before you re&s;olve; and to be well a&s;&s;ur'd that I really de&s;erve Degradation and Excommunication, at lea&s;t in a Civil or Legal Sen&s;e, before you venture to inflict either of them upon me; as mindful of that great Guilt you will your &s;elves incur in ca&s;e you pa&s;s a Ra&s;h or Un|ju&s;t Sentence. I &s;ay a <HI>Ra&s;h or &V;nju&s;t Sentence:</HI> For tho' I hope you are di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;trict Ju&s;tice in this as well as in all other Cau&s;es that come before you, yet is there peculiar Danger in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, that you may involuntarily pa&s;s a wrong Sen|tence; becau&s;e the very Nature of the Cau&s;e is New; the Points concern'd are of a deep and uncommon Nature; the Rules of judging by are not &s;oon nor ha&s;tily to be Examined; &s;everal of the Quotations u&s;ually appeal'd to appear to have been read other|wi&s;e Originally than they are in our Modern Copies; &s;everal of the common Tran&s;lations are ju&s;tly to be Altered, as contrary to the Meaning of the Originals; Antient Facts hereto relating have not always been truly &s;tated by the later Authors; Partiality has frequently overborn the Truth, in the Writers on the&s;e Controver&s;ies. Original Records have been too much laid a&s;ide, and Modern Partial Repre&s;enta|tions taken place; You have not had any Legal Ju|dicial Proceedings in any Prior Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, as you u&s;ually have, to A&s;&s;i&s;t or Guide you. The greate&s;t Part of your Body are Con&s;tituted of &s;uch as, how Eminent &s;oever they may be in their own Profe&s;&s;ions of the Common and Civil Laws, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have throughly Con&s;idered the&s;e The|ological Matters. This is a Ca&s;e of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence, a leading Ca&s;e indeed; upon which in great part depends the Freedom or Slavery of this Nation in Religious Matters: And therefore it is not, I humbly conceive, to be determined by bare hearing of &s;ome Pleadings in Court, but by an exact
<PB N="39" REF="41">
Examination of all the Texts and Te&s;timonies at Home. And tho' you may be willing to &s;horten your Work, by &s;uppo&s;ing the Convocation did throughly Examine the&s;e Propo&s;itions, before they made that &s;ort of Imperfect Cen&s;ure upon them: which, I &s;uppo&s;e, Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> depends on; yet is not the Fact &s;o: For, not to &s;ay that the Con|vocation it &s;elf (alone) cannot, I think, by our Law determin what is Here&s;y; it is evident That Imper|fect Cen&s;ure was Voted before my Evidence or Four Volumes were Printed; and when the Members did not, or rather would not &s;ee them, even in MS. It was Voted before I was ever heard in my own Defence; nay, while I was all along deny'd to be heard upon the mo&s;t earne&s;t Application: It was Voted with great Variety in each Hou&s;e; and never yet made the Legal Act of even the Convocation: It was afterwards mo&s;t &s;trictly Concealed: And tho' Application was at length made to her mo&s;t Excel|lent Maje&s;ty for her Royal Confirmation; which a|lone could make it a truly Legal Cen&s;ure; yet has that Confirmation never been obtained to this Day. So that the Original Examination and Determinati|on of the intire Cau&s;e, if you re&s;olve to pa&s;s any Sentence about it at all, mu&s;t certainly belong to you. Which Con&s;ideration will, I hope, have that Weight as to oblige you to hear every Argument patiently, to Examine every Te&s;timony of Con&s;e|quence by the Original, to enter into the intire Me|rits of the Cau&s;e, and at la&s;t to Judge and Deter|mine upon the whole Evidence, when it is compleat|ly laid before you, and not otherwi&s;e; according to that exact Care which all Impartial Judges make u&s;e of in their &s;everal Courts on other Occa&s;ions. Which Procedure if I may depend upon, I am no way Sollicitous of the Succe&s;s of this Pro&s;ecution; but &s;hall have great Cau&s;e to thank Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> for giving me &s;uch an Opportunity of an Open and Publick Vindication of my &s;elf, or rather of &s;ome of
<GAP DESC="MISSING" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="40" REF="42">
the Great and Fundamental Doctrines of Chri&s;tiani|ty, from the odious Imputations of Ariani&s;m and He|re&s;y, under which they have &s;o long and &s;o unju&s;tly lain in the later Ages of the Church. And give me leave to &s;ay farther, it highly concerns this Court in particular to be very Cautious in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e it has not only ventur'd without all Precedents, I think, to Judge directly in a Cau&s;e of Here&s;y, but has certainly without all Precedents ta|ken it in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, and has thereby excluded me from all certain Relief by an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Appeal el&s;ewhere, which is rarely, if ever, deny'd in the like Cau&s;es to any Subject whom&s;oever. So pre&s;&s;ing it &s;eems is the Danger the Church of <HI>England</HI> is in from what looks like Old Chri&s;tianity! and &s;o zealous are &s;ome of her Members to &s;top its Progre&s;s, not by Evidence, Arguments and Te&s;timonies, but by the&s;e Legal Proceedings and Pro&s;ecutions!</P>
<P N="8">VIII. I beg of this Court to Con&s;ider how many Opinions have been &s;ometimes taken for Fal&s;e or He|retical, and accordingly Cen&s;ured and Condemned by Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority; nay, and how many poor Innocent Men's Liberties and &s;ometimes Lives have been taken from them, in con&s;equence of &s;uch Cen|&s;ures and Condemnations, when yet tho&s;e Opinions have appeared upon Examination to be certainly true, agreeable to Chri&s;tianity, and have according|ly been generally receiv'd afterward. Thus the <HI>Mil|lennium</HI>, or Thou&s;and Years happy State of the Church on Earth, at the End of the World, was e&s;teemed an Here&s;y for many Ages together, and Condemned as &s;uch by the Church; yet is it very evident that it is a Scripture Doctrine, and was be|lieved in the earlie&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel, and does now begin to be acknowledged for true by the mo&s;t Learned of the Moderns. Thus are the poor <HI>Au|dians</HI> put by <HI>Epiphanius</HI> among the re&s;t of his He|reticks; and if you enquire you will find by his
<PB N="41" REF="43">
own Account that they were &s;trictly Serious and Good Men, who only refu&s;ed to obey an Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Law for the time of the Celebration of <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>, while they &s;aw it contradicted an Apo&s;tolical Law about the &s;ame Matter; and this while <HI>Epiphanius</HI> him&s;elf owns that Law to be really Apo&s;tolical. So that if we judge by this Ca&s;e, He it &s;eems is to be e&s;teemed an Heretick, who prefers the Doctrines and Laws of Chri&s;t delivered by his Apo&s;tles, before the Doctrines and Laws of the Church delivered in her Councils: In which Sen&s;e truly, I think, the Word Here&s;y has been commonly u&s;ed ever &s;ince the Fourth Century. Tho' I mu&s;t by the way con|fe&s;s, that the later Churches do never directly own this Definition of Here&s;y, but are &s;till &s;o Wi&s;e as to pretend that either the Doctrines of Chri&s;t are al|ways to bear the Sen&s;e which the pre&s;ent Church puts upon them; or el&s;e that the Church has Power to Alter or Improve tho&s;e Laws, as &s;he &s;ees occa&s;ion; which Pretences do generally gain her Point as well as the other. Thus al&s;o we have in the &s;ame <HI>Epi|phanius</HI> another Here&s;y belonging to the <HI>Antidicoma|rianitae</HI>, or tho&s;e e&s;teemed the <HI>Enemies of the Virgin Mary</HI>, becau&s;e they denied her Perpetual Virginity; and accordingly this Denyal has long pa&s;&s;ed in the Church for Erroneous, if not Heretical. Yet it is very plain in Scripture and the earlie&s;t Antiquity, that the Brethren and Si&s;ters of our Lord, o$ the Children which the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> had by <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> her Husband, were not a few; and that both <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Jude</HI>, two of the Sacred Writers of the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment</HI>, were of that Number;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Sermons and E&s;&s;ays, <HI>p. 182. &mdash; 196.</HI></NOTE> as I have fully proved in a particular Di&s;&s;ertati|on &s;everal Years ago, without any Re|ply. Nor do the Learned, at lea&s;t a|mong the Prote&s;tants, care to reckon that Opinion among the Here&s;ies any longer. Thus, if we go but to the Eighth Century, and therein to the Seventh General Council, the Second Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, where
<PB N="42" REF="44">
no fewer than 350 Bi&s;hops were A&s;&s;embled, and where the Council it &s;elf affirms that the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South Parts of <HI>Christendom</HI> did unani|mou&s;ly agree in the &s;ame Determination, we &s;hall find that the grand <HI>Error</HI> or <HI>Here&s;y</HI> Condemned was that of the <HI>Iconocla&s;ts</HI>, or the Contemners of the Wor&s;hip of Images; and that grand Doctrine, or rather Practice that was e&s;tabli&s;h'd was, the Wor|&s;hip of tho&s;e Images them&s;elves, in direct oppo&s;ition to the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Revelations, and to all the mo&s;t Primitive Antiquity: Nor were there wanting Di&s;tinctions and Eva&s;ions, whereby this gro&s;s Super&s;tition and Idolatry was palliated and ex|cu&s;ed even among Chri&s;tians. And I think there cannot well be a more affecting, nay, amazing In|&s;tance given, to what degree of Extravagance and Impiety the Greate&s;t Bodies, and even General Councils may arrive, when once they leave the Method of fair Examination, and frequent recour&s;e to the Original Records of the Go&s;pel, and go by Policy, Party, Voting, and Modern Determinations only. Thus, to omit a va&s;t Number of In&s;tances, if we come lower, and to our own Nation in <HI>Linwood</HI>'s Provincial, that very Book, which is the grand Guide of all our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts in other Mat|ters, and which &s;ome of Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>'s Councel would have to be &s;till a Legal Rule for Here&s;y among us, we have the denial of the Adoration of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>, of Saints and Angels, nay, of Images them|&s;elves, enumerated as Heretical Doctrines, for which Men were to be Pro&s;ecuted: which Pro&s;ecution many Hone&s;t and Sincere Chri&s;tians have &s;uffered in former Days on tho&s;e Accounts. Thus al&s;o, if we come lower &s;till in our own Nation; What were the mighty Errors, the odious Here&s;ies, for which &s;o many poor hone&s;t Chri&s;tians were Cited, Pro&s;ecuted, Condemned, Excommunicated, Impri&s;oned, and Burnt in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, but tho&s;e which are now the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Doctrines of this Church, and part of
<PB N="43" REF="45">
its 39 Articles? Which very Articles yet are them|&s;elves introduced as of Authority enough, as to o|ther Points to convict me, in order to all but the la&s;t of the &s;ame Penalties. Nay, to come &s;till lower, &s;ince the Reformation; What mighty Complaints have we formerly had of the <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors, or Here&s;y? What great Struggles, to hinder its ad|mi&s;&s;ion? What Vehement Endeavours to &s;upport <HI>Calvini&s;m</HI> again&s;t it, by new Articles, Sub&s;criptions, and Decrees? What violent Endeavours u&s;ed, even in Parliament, to &s;ecure the one and prevent the other? And yet in &s;pite of all this, &s;ome of tho&s;e Notions, which have been called by the once odious Name of <HI>Arminian</HI>, have by their own Evidence &s;o made their way, that few among us do now embrace the contrary, but &s;uch of our Di&s;&s;enting Brethren, and Presbyterians of <HI>Scotland</HI>, as have not yet given them&s;elves leave to Examine tho&s;e Matters by Rea|&s;on, Scripture, and Primitive Antiquity. And in|deed, &s;uch has been the Folly of the&s;e later Ages, that they have &s;ometimes declar'd Philo&s;ophical or A&s;tronomical Truths Erroneous and Heretical. Witne&s;s that A&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Vigilius</HI>'s, concerning the Being of <HI>Antipodes</HI>, for which he was Impri&s;oned; and which yet every Child that has learnt the Ele|ments of Geography now knows to be true. And Witne&s;s that Copernical A&s;&s;ertion, about the Earth's Motion, which was embraced by <HI>Galilaeo</HI>, for which he was &s;orely Per&s;ecuted, and forced to Abjure it, and which is at this Day in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> under Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures, as Fal&s;e and Heretical; tho' it be now found unque&s;tionably true, and own'd to be &s;o by all A&s;tronomers. Nor do I think what I a&s;&s;erted in my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>, that the De|luge was cau&s;ed by a Comet, had it ever come be|fore any Council or Synod of the Church &s;ince the Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, would ea&s;ily have e&s;caped the like Cen&s;ures of Erroneous or Heretical. Nor has one of the Repre&s;entations in the Name of a part of that Body, from which Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>'s Articles again&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="46">
me are them&s;elves taken, omitted to Cen&s;ure that <HI>New Theory</HI>, as one of the Cau&s;es of the Infidelity of this Age; altho' it be mo&s;t evidently de&s;ign'd to prevent or cure tlue Infidelity; and will, I hope, more tend to &s;o excellent a Purpo&s;e, than a Thou|&s;and &s;uch Repre&s;entations as that is: E&s;pecially &s;ince I am able now to &s;hew the very Comet that then came by, and to prove by all its Circum&s;tances, that it did pa&s;s by at that time; as that &s;mall Paper, which I formerly made bold to pre&s;ent to mo&s;t of the Members of this Court, has fully demon&s;trated. And now I dare Appeal to every one that hears me what is to be e&s;teemed the Natural Con&s;equence of this Ob&s;ervation? 'Tis certainly no other than this, that All Eccle&s;ia&s;tical A&s;&s;emblies, Synods, and Con|vocations, &s;hould imitate the Civil Courts of Judica|ture, and fully &s;atisfy them&s;elves about the Original and Authentick Doctrines and Laws of Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, by his Holy Apo&s;tles, before they pa&s;s any more Sentences, or make any more Decrees about &s;uch Important Matters; that they &s;et a&s;ide all tho&s;e Modern and Uncertain Rules and Opinions, which have &s;o often fail'd their Predece&s;&s;ors in the like Ca&s;es, and have &s;till recour&s;e to the Original Stand|ards; that they lay no &s;tre&s;s on any later Creeds, or Canons, or Con&s;titutions, on any Modern Articles, Liturgies, or Rubricks, but try all by the mo&s;t Pri|mitive Records them&s;elves; that they tru&s;t no lon|ger to that imperfect Catalogue of Canonical and In&s;pired Books, which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has alone put into their Hands, but endeavour to enquire after all the Sacred Books and Remains the Apo&s;tles and their Companions have left to the Church; and to receive them accordingly. If this was once done, and an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical A&s;&s;embly, con&s;tituted as the Apo&s;tles appointed, &s;hould take Cognizance of my Opinions, and re&s;olve to Examine them fairly and throughly, by the real Original Standards them&s;elves, and thereupon &s;hould di&s;cover they were plainly fal&s;e

and Heretical, they would be intirely Ju&s;tifyed in Enjoining me to Retract them, and in Rejecting, or Excommunicating me, upon my Refu&s;al, from the Society of Chri&s;tians. Tho' even that Rejection, or Excommunication, ought to be my <HI>only</HI> Puni&s;h|ment: It being mo&s;t evident that all farther Tem|poral or Corporal Penalties are utterly un&s;uppor|ted by, if not contrary to the Chri&s;tian Con&s;titution, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. But when nothing of this is done; but all is left to be decided by Modern Settle|ments and Opinions, Entertained often upon almo&s;t no Evidence at all, it mu&s;t be expected that &s;uch Determinations will have little or no weight with the Hone&s;t and Impartial; but, on the Contrary, will render all &s;uch Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority &s;till more and more mean and Contemptible in the World.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It will be here worth our while to Inquire into the true &s;tate of the Controver&s;y, and to run over a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of it in the pa&s;t Ages, and e&s;pecially among our &s;elves in the la&s;t and pre&s;ent Century, e're we venture into the depth of the &s;ame Immediately. It is therefore to be Ob&s;erv'd that when the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> had Condemned the Ra&s;h, Novel, and Un&s;criptural Notions and Language of <HI>Arius</HI>, and of his particular Followers; It ventur'd to u&s;e &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions on the other &s;ide; which &s;eem indeed to be equally Ra&s;h and Novel, and were certainly equally Un&s;criptural; but explain'd their meaning &s;o at that very time as to give tole|rable Satisfaction for the pre&s;ent to tho&s;e that knew tho&s;e Explications, e&s;pecially in the We&s;tern Parts of the World But after &s;ome years it appear'd that, whatever Expo&s;itions they had Privately made among them&s;elves, and in how mild a &s;en&s;e &s;oever they had u&s;ed tho&s;e new and un&s;criptural Expre&s;&s;ions, the Body of the Church, e&s;pecially in the Ea&s;tern parts, was highly Offended at them; E&s;pecially when the expo&s;itions did not always keep pace with the words them&s;elves; and &s;ome
<GAP DESC="MISSING" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="46" REF="48">
followers of <HI>Marcellus</HI> and <HI>Athana&s;ias</HI>, two per&s;ons of great Intimacy, but little Learning, who were going apace into &s;ome Novel Notions and Philo&s;o|phy, took a handle from them to carry things much farther than the Council ever de&s;ign'd, and intire|ly to Corrupt the Ancient Simplicity and &s;acred Language of the Church, till then Generally pre|&s;erv'd; and all that under the Notion of Oppo&s;ition to the odious Here&s;y of <HI>Arius</HI>, and under the Um|brage of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, of it's Condemnation of real Ariani&s;m, and of it's own Novel and Un&s;crip|tural Expre&s;&s;ions before Mentioned. Upon this a great Conte&s;t was rai&s;ed in the Church, and the Body of it, e&s;pecially in the Ea&s;tern Parts, did in|deed agree with the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, &s;o far as it Condemned direct Ariani&s;m, and, in a manner, &s;o far as that Council had explain'd it &s;elf upon its Novel and Un&s;criptural Expre&s;&s;ions al&s;o; but as for the followers of <HI>Marcellus</HI> and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, with their Improvements and Rea&s;onings, and as to the going on with any of tho&s;e Novel and Un&s;cri|ptural notions and expre&s;&s;ions, it highly di&s;approv'd of the &s;ame; and in many famous, and numerous Synods, which were a&s;&s;embled in the following 30 or 40 Years, did di&s;claim and aboli&s;h them. while they &s;till took care, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to Skreen the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf from reproach; and &s;till agreed in the Condemnation of what was properly the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y, as it had been Con|demn'd by that Council before. This was the true &s;tate of that Matter, till tho&s;e mo&s;t famous and numerous Councils of <HI>Seleucia</HI> and <HI>Ariminum</HI>, A.D. 359. which were, as I may &s;ay, one Council met in two places, and Con&s;i&s;ted of about 600 Bi&s;hops, or about twice as many as met at <HI>Nice</HI> before. This mo&s;t Oecumenical or univer&s;al Council or Councils, which the Church had then &s;een, agreed to what the generality of the foregoing Councils had done, and &s;etled all upon the ancient foundations, without

After this the Heats and Parties grew again in &s;ome time more Violent. Some of the Bi&s;hops, tho' much the fewer in Number, out of Op|po&s;ition to the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Here&s;y, which was Spreading in &s;ome Parts, e&s;pecially in <HI>Egypt</HI>, and in the We&s;t, and was Supported by the <HI>Popes</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>, who came Readily into it, &s;eem to have gone too Near to the very Here&s;y of <HI>Arius</HI>. Others, who were much the greate&s;t Number, ran rather into the Oppo&s;ite Extreme: and became more Fa|vourable to the Contrary Party: and tho' they could not go into the more Fooli&s;h Explications of <HI>Marcellus</HI>, yet did they by degrees Comply more and more with the better Contriv'd Notions and Hypothe&s;es of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>; till at Length, after many Attempts and Councils, the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Here&s;y got &s;uch Ground as to be the Prevailing Doctrine towards the latter part of that fourth Century, tho' not &s;ooner Nor was it any great wonder that when both the Emperors and the <HI>Popes</HI> had Embrac'd it, their Edicts and Decrees &s;hould at la&s;t Prevail, and E&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame Here&s;y, together with the other Branches of Popery, which &s;oon followed it, over the whole Chri&s;tian World.

Creed, kept it's ground, and was very little Oppo&s;ed during all the re&s;t of the Uninterrupted Reign of Ignorance and Popery in the 11.12.13 14. and 15. Centuries. At the time of the Refor|mation <HI>Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, &amp;c.</HI> happen'd to be &s;o Bu&s;y about the other Points of Popery, that they never Particularly Examin'd the&s;e Points about the Trinity and Incarnation, Whether the Com|mon Doctrines and Opinions in tho&s;e Matters, were true or not; but took them all for Granted, without any di&s;tinct Examination. However, not a few of the fir&s;t <HI>Italian</HI> Prote&s;tants began to &s;ee that the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrines were fal&s;e; and <HI>Era&s;|mus</HI> him&s;elf, who was the great Re&s;torer of Learning, and by far the be&s;t Judge of old Chri&s;tianity then in the World, &s;aw that tho&s;e Doctrines could not be &s;upported by Primitive Antiquity, and, by the By, gave Sufficient Hints that his Opinion was nearly the &s;ame with that of tho&s;e who had long been called <HI>Arians</HI>. However, He had not Courage enough to &s;tem the Tide; but rather, by In&s;erting in his third Edition of the New Te&s;tament the &s;purious Ver&s;e in 1. Joh. V. 7. Concerning the <HI>three that bear Record in Heaven</HI> from one Pre|tended MS. in <HI>Britain</HI>, without any Authority at all from his own MSS. and contrary to his own Opinion al&s;o, he in effect yielded to the <HI>Athana|&s;ians</HI>. So it was no wonder that the common Do|ctrine &s;till Continued. After &s;ome time aro&s;e <HI>Socinus</HI>, and &s;everal other very great and Learned Per&s;ons, who fell upon the Examination of the&s;e Doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation; and that, to do them Ju&s;tice, with all po&s;&s;ible Application, Sagacity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s. But ala&s;s! the&s;e great Men, after they had throughly Confuted the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> He|re&s;y, fell into another equally oppo&s;ite to the Do|ctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, even that of one Branch of the mo&s;t primitive Hereticks the <HI>Ebi|onites</HI>,
<PB N="94" REF="51">
which was utterly Irreconcilable to the pre&s;ent Books of Scripture, to the other Apo&s;to|lical Remains, and to all primitive Antiquity; and thereby gave the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> a mighty Handle again&s;t them: whence they could make no great Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Body of Chri&s;tians, who were directly guided by Revelation; but only upon &s;uch as ventur'd to make them&s;elves Doctrines, and tho&s;e not &s;uch as were be&s;t atte&s;ted to, as Chri&s;tian, but &s;uch as &s;eem'd mo&s;t agreeable to their own Rea&s;on. However, &s;everal of tho&s;e new Inquirers did not go that length, but kept clo&s;er to the Original Faith of Chri&s;tians, and &s;ettled them&s;elves Churches on that better Foun|dation; which are not yet extinct in <HI>Tran&s;ilvania, Hungary</HI>, and other Countries. tho' the great difficulty of &s;ettling Compleat Societies in Oppo|&s;ition to legal E&s;tabli&s;hments is always very Great, and not very many of tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians now-a-days have that Courage or &s;ence of Duty as to go openly into mea&s;ures that are likely to Occa&s;ion Di&s;grace, Lo&s;&s;es, and Per&s;ecutions, to them. But then, in &s;ome time the Learned Je&s;uit <HI>Petavius</HI> wrote very largely upon the&s;e Subjects; and while he pretended to believe the Doctrine of the pre&s;ent Church in the&s;e points, he, in a manner, yielded up the <HI>Antenicene Fathers</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>&V;nitarians</HI> that have of late been called <HI>Arians</HI>, and thereby gave a great Blow to the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine. At the &s;ame time that truly Great and Good Man <HI>Grotius</HI>, upon his Examination, and, as I have been told, his great Conver&s;ation with <HI>Petavius</HI> him&s;elf about the&s;e Points, &s;aw that the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Scheme was fal&s;e, and &s;eems al&s;o to have &s;een that the Opinion of late called <HI>Arian</HI> was the primitive Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity: tho' &s;ome, without &s;ufficient Autho|rity, &s;uppo&s;e he went over to the <HI>Socinians</HI> them|&s;elves.

Not long after this another of the mo&s;t Learned <HI>French</HI> Men, <HI>Huetius</HI> by Name, one whom I look on as more Judicious and Hone&s;t, and &s;carce|ly le&s;s Learned than <HI>Petavius</HI> him&s;elf, under the Notion of giving us an Account of, and &s;ome Apo|logy for the great <HI>Origen</HI> and his Notions, who was of old E&s;teemed the Father of tho&s;e now called <HI>Arians</HI>, did not ob&s;curely follow the Exam|ple of <HI>Petavius</HI>; and, without owning his own Convictions, gave up the Generality of the <HI>Ante|nicene</HI> Fathers to tho&s;e now called <HI>Arians</HI>, as the other had done. In <HI>Holland</HI> al&s;o that Learned Body of Chri&s;tians called <HI>Remonstrants</HI>, &s;uch as <HI>Epi&s;copius, Curcellaeus, Limborch</HI>, and others, have long been weary of the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine; E&s;pe|cially of the nece&s;&s;ity that was u&s;ually put upon Clergy men and Chri&s;tians by the modern Churches to &s;ub&s;cribe or believe the &s;ame: without appearing fully &s;atisfyed which particular Opinions thereto relating were really true and agreable to Scripture. At home the mo&s;t Learned Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> was one of the fir&s;t that began to &s;ee light in the&s;e Matters, and Ventut'd a great way, and with great Evidence in Antiquity to &s;et them in a better Light, and to Correct the modern groundle&s;s Notions concerning the Numerical Unity and perfect Equality of the Per&s;ons in the Trinity; and that with no &s;mall Succe&s;s among the truly Learned and Judicious; how little &s;oever the more Ignorant or Unthinking read his Book, or Examin'd his Arguments.

nearer to the Original faith in this Matter. I pa&s;s over the Controver&s;ial Books of Dr. <HI>South</HI>, Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>, Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI>, Bi&s;hop <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>, and &s;ome others, as not Written with that Judgment, or Re|gard to the Original Notions of the fir&s;t Ages, which they ought to have been; as well as the &s;everal <HI>Socinian</HI> an&s;wers to them: which yet could no way be Reply'd to, upon the Common Foundations; tho' they were not always written with that Seri|ou&s;ne&s;s, or Evidence for their own Opinions, that one might expect in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; and I Ob&s;erve by the way, that it was vi&s;ible how plainly every one of the&s;e eager Adver&s;aries could Confute the notions of his Adver&s;ary, and how Weakly he could &s;upport his own; How Clearly Dr. <HI>South</HI> could confute the Trithei&s;m of Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI> the <HI>Sabelliani&s;m</HI> of Dr. <HI>South</HI>; and the <HI>Socinian</HI> Animad|verters, the gro&s;s Ab&s;urdity of both; without being able any of them to give a Satisfactory Account of the true Doctrine of the Trinity, in agreement with the Scriptures, and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers; and al&s;o that the Church could not then nor ever &s;ince be prevail'd on to declare Authentickly for any Side, or to let her Sons know what Notions about the Trinity they were to embrace. But to Proceed; I Ob&s;erve here farther, That &s;ome other Books writ|ten about the &s;ame time with the former made more Impre&s;&s;ion, and that the pre&s;ent Attempt to &s;et the&s;e Doctrines on a better Foundation, has been in part owing to the &s;ame. The fir&s;t I &s;hall name are the 28. Propo&s;itions, &s;uppos'd to be written by the Right Reverend the late Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI>; which tho' a very &s;mall Pamphlet, and Written without a deep Knowledge in Chri&s;tian Antiquity, or indeed Venturing to the Bottom of the Contro|ver&s;y, did plainly &s;et the matter in a much better View, and advanced Notions much more Rational and more agreeable to the Scriptures, than any of

the fore-mentioned. And from hence, in part, do Date my own fir&s;t Glimmerings of Light in the&s;e Matters. It being very Obvious to me, who had Studied the Bible from my very Child-hood, tho' I had not then read the other Ancient Records of Chri&s;tianity, to take notice that the Bi&s;hop's Notions, (which certainly are &s;omewhat near to tho&s;e that have long been called <HI>Arian</HI>, tho' they do not go &s;o far) were va&s;tly more agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, than tho&s;e others that were then Current among us. The &s;econd Phamphlet that gave &s;ome farther Light, was Dr. <HI>Pains</HI> three Sermons about the Tri|nity, with his Notes upon them; which tho they were very Offen&s;ive to the &s;trictly <HI>Orthodox</HI>, and had like to have drawn down a Per&s;ecution upon the Author, yet did certainly come nearer to the Original Doctrine, and Demon&s;trated the Fouda|tions of it, [<HI>viz.</HI> That the one God of the Chri&s;tian Religion, was no other than God the Father only; and that the Word God, was not u&s;ed in Scripture ab&s;olutely in the &s;ame manner of the Son as it was of the Father,] by better Evidence than of late had commonly been made u&s;e of among us. But the Third and Principal Book that has occa&s;ion'd the mo&s;t Di&s;|pute, and has mo&s;t contributed to the rejection of the gro&s;s Schola&s;tick <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI>, or rather di&s;guis'd <HI>Sabellian</HI> Doctrines, I mean tho&s;e of the Numerical U|nity of the Sub&s;tance, and of the ab&s;olute Equality of the Three Divine Per&s;ons, as well as to the &s;topping the Progre&s;s of the other Parts of the Original Do|ctrine, was that of Bi&s;hop <HI>Bull</HI>'s Defence of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. For this mo&s;t Learned and Judi|cious Per&s;on, who was a great Reader and Admi|rer of the <HI>Ante-Nicene</HI> Fathers, and who plainly &s;aw no &s;mall part of the Evidence that tho&s;e called <HI>Ari|ans</HI> had among them for their Doctrine, and that part, at lea&s;t, of what they alledg'd again&s;t the mo|dern gro&s;s <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> or <HI>Sabelitans</HI>, was undenia|bly

But upon farther Con&s;ider$tion, and a very mi&s;taken Notion, as to part of the Doctrine of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, un&s;upported by all Original Authority, he at length prevailed upon him&s;elf to &s;top &s;hort; and having given up as Indefen&s;ible Part of the common Doctrine, he &s;atisfy'd him&s;elf to &s;tay where he thought the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> did &s;o; and thereupon he wrote that his mo&s;t famous Book above-mention'd: Tho' indeed this was done in a way too Po&s;itive, too Vehement, and with too great a Contempt for his Oppo&s;ers, and in particu|lar for that Great Young Man <HI>Sandius</HI>, who had &s;ome time before written mo&s;t Learnedly for the <HI>Eu|&s;ebian</HI> Doctrine. This Celebrated Work of Bp. <HI>Bull</HI> had a mighty Approbation from the Church of <HI>France</HI>, which had been, 'tis likely, not a little con|cern'd at the Conce&s;&s;ions of two of their greate&s;t Men, <HI>Petavius</HI>, and <HI>Huetius</HI>, in this Point; and was highly applauded at home al&s;o; and indeed does con|tain all that can be &s;aid for that Cau&s;e; nay, a great deal more than, upon a nice Examination, can be ju&s;tified. Tho' it indeed &s;hews al&s;o but too plainly, how almo&s;t all Controver&s;y Writers impo&s;e upon them&s;elves and the World; and how ea&s;ily they can make them&s;elves and others believe tho&s;e Facts or Notions to have been anciently real, which they have now a great mind &s;hould be &s;o. This Book of Controver&s;y I own to be the be&s;t that ever has been, or can be written by the wi&s;e&s;t <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>; and I farther own, that I believe it will prove the la&s;t very con&s;iderable Book that ever will be Writ|ten by them.

And here I mu&s;t inform this Court, if they do not already know it, that when I &s;ome Years ago Stu|died the&s;e important Matters, according to my u&s;u|al Method in Chronology, and in other Points of Con&s;equence, wherever they depend on Facts and Te&s;timonies, I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to alter the intire Nature of the Enquiry; and tho' I was Educated in the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine, and had no Temptation from this World to incline me to for|&s;ake it; nay, had all my future Intere&s;ts and Hopes here depending on it, yet did I re&s;olve to Enquire for Truth at any rate, and to take the be&s;t Method I could in order to di&s;cover it. Accordingly, be|fore I pronounced about the Ancient Chri&s;tian Do|ctrines, I re&s;olved with my own Eyes to read all the old Chri&s;tian Books both Sacred and Primitive, and from thence, and thence only, to draw my Account of the Original Notions of the fir&s;t Ages. I re&s;olved al&s;o to do it Impartially; and no more to omit or pervert the Pa&s;&s;ages that might &s;eem to favour the one Side, than the other: And I re|&s;olved to take the Opinions of the Fir&s;t Century from the Writers of that Century, of the Second from the Writers of the Second, and of the Third from its own Writers; and &s;o to &s;ee Impartially what were the real Opinions of the Church at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, from a Peru&s;al of the Original Records of that Council them&s;elves, and of tho&s;e that were in whole, or in part Contemporary with them; without the unfair way of explaining Au|thors of the Fir&s;t and Second by tho&s;e of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries; or making the one &s;ay what the others &s;aid, or rather what the Moderns have a Mind they &s;hould &s;ay; and from all the other like Me|thods, by which a fair and upright Per&s;on would enquire into their real Opinions.

The&s;e Accounts, as to the mo&s;t Ancient Times, are con|tained in the Fourth Volume of my <HI>Primitive Chri&s;ti|anity reviv'd</HI>; and they have been now &s;o long in the Hands of the mo&s;t Learned, at fir&s;t in MS. and &s;ince in Print, without an An&s;wer, that I am bold to &s;ay, it is a plain Sign the Evidence is looked on by them as very &s;trong, and the Te&s;timonies not ea&s;y to be An&s;wered. I &s;ay my Papers are &s;till <HI>without an An&s;wer</HI>, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many &s;maller or larger Pamphlets have been written again&s;t them, or again&s;t their Author.

They never could be brought to name a Committee to hear me, or confer with me, how earne&s;tly &s;oever I wi&s;hed for it. They have never &s;o much as de|&s;ir'd or appointed any truly Learned and Judicious Men to Write an An&s;wer: Nay, they have never been willing to determine which are tho&s;e particu|lar Texts of Scripture, Te&s;timonies of Antiquity, or Pa&s;&s;ages in the two fir&s;t General Councils, on which their Cen&s;ures or Accu&s;ations were founded. And indeed the only very Learned, Judicious and con|&s;iderable Books that have appeared &s;ince upon this Subject, I mean Dr. <HI>Clark's Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</HI>, and its Defences, tho' they &s;eem to me not to go quite &s;o near the Original Doctrine as did the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf, are yet known in good mea&s;ure to contain the very &s;ame Notions that I had before deliver'd; and to add a great deal of new Evidence to them, both from the Ancients and Moderns al&s;o. Nor, as is very well known, has any one of the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> given &s;o much as a tolerable An&s;wer to tho&s;e his Books hitherto: So that this Court &s;eems plainly Appealed to as the la&s;t Remedy again&s;t this Attempt, for re&s;toring &s;ome Doctrines of old Chri&s;tianity: And I dare &s;ay, is generally more depended on for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame, than all the other Replies

Yet are the Canonical Books of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> here and every where ju&s;tly by all made a Grand Te&s;t of Truth, and at lea&s;t One of the mo&s;t Sacred Standards for Judging of Error and Here&s;y by. So that if the Eight Books of Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions be really Canonical; nay, contain'd in all the numerous Copies of the Original Canon it|&s;elf in all Languages, even at this very Day, which I take to be the real Truth of the Ca&s;e, the&s;e Ar|ticles contradict them&s;elves, and I am hereby clear|ed, and the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> convicted of Error or He|&s;y. 'Tis true, the &s;ame Articles do al&s;o affirm, That the&s;e Books <Q>&startq;Were never yet acknowledged as part of the Canon of Scripture by any Gene|ral Council, nor received as &s;uch in any Chri&s;tian &endq;Church".</Q> And I confe&s;s, that when the Convo|cation fir&s;t made this Cen&s;ure, I mean before they &s;aw my Papers, they, as well as the re&s;t of the World, might &s;uppo&s;e the Facts to have been &s;o. But that this &s;hould be affirmed here again, &s;o long after the Publication of the Third Volume of my <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tianity reviv'd</HI>, wherein it is fully &s;hew'd, that tho&s;e A&s;&s;ertions are intirely Fal&s;e and Groundle&s;s, is very &s;trange and &s;urprizing. I have

there proved, [<HI>p.</HI> 655-659.] that this Book appears to have been ever e&s;teemed Canonical; that accordingly Seven of the Eight General Councils either directly quote their la&s;t Chapter, that is, tho&s;e Canons, the la&s;t of which reckons the Con&s;titutions among the re&s;t of the Canonical Books; which is the Ca&s;e, as to the fir&s;t Four; and for the Three la&s;t, being all that had any occa&s;ion to &s;peak directly of the Canon of Scripture, they unanimou&s;ly confe&s;s the &s;ame Con&s;titutions to be Canonical. In Truth, the Handle which has been taken of late to leave the&s;e Con&s;titutions out of the Modern Canons, or Cata|logues of In&s;pired Writings, appears to have been only the Unacquaintedne&s;s of the late Ages in this important Matter, their not ob&s;erving what the Ancients meant by the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI>, and by <HI>Canonical Books</HI>, or <HI>Books in the Canon</HI>; and their Injudicious way of Confounding &s;ome Partial Ca|nons, or &s;ome Ancient Catalogues of the Publick Books of Chri&s;tianity, openly read in Churches, with the Intire and Original <HI>Canon</HI> it &s;elf, or com|pleat Catalogue of Sacred Books, which were then Written when the Canon was made. And I mu&s;t profe&s;s, that I hardly know an In&s;tance of &s;o gro&s;s a Mi&s;take in the Modern Learned Men about any other Matter, as they generally make in this impor|tant one, about the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI>. They might indeed with &s;ome better &s;hew of Rea&s;on have affirmed, that the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI> is not Authen|tick; that <HI>Canonical Books</HI> are not of peculiar Au|thority; that to be <HI>in the Canon</HI> is of no Con&s;e|quence; becau&s;e the direct mention of &s;uch a for|mal <HI>Canon</HI>, or of an Authentick Catalogue of <HI>Cano|nical Books</HI>, is not &s;o frequent till the Fourth Cen|tury. But when they pretend to rely upon &s;uch an <HI>Ancient Canon</HI>, and to di&s;tingui&s;h Books by the Mark of <HI>Canonical Books</HI>, and <HI>Books &V;ncanonical</HI>, of <HI>Books in the Canon</HI>, and <HI>not in the Canon</HI>, without

However what I de&s;ire may be noted on my own Account here is this, that while my Doctrines are owned as atte&s;ted to by the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;ti|tutions</HI>, and while the <HI>Canonical Books of the New Te&s;tament</HI> are al&s;o own'd as a Principal Rule and Standard to Judge of Error and Here&s;y by, 'tis all Ab&s;urdity and Contradiction to pretend tho&s;e Do|ctrines to be either Erroneous or Heretical; becau&s;e the&s;e Eight Books of Con&s;titutions are mo&s;t cer|tainly, in the true Original Sence of the&s;e Words, <HI>Canonical Books of the New Testament</HI>. But I mu&s;t not here enlarge upon this Important Subject, but re|&s;erve what I have farther to &s;ay, and all the Evi|dence for what I have already &s;aid about it, to its proper Place hereafter; where, if this Court plea&s;e to give me leave, I &s;hall largely Treat of the whole Matter, and produce all my Evidence before you.</P>

I cannot but grievou&s;ly complain of the hard Treatment I meet with from Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>, in this Pro&s;ecution, which is on account of my hone&s;t De|&s;igns for reviving old Chri&s;tanity, while almo&s;t all other Notorious Errors, Here&s;ies, and Wild Noti|ons; nay, really Irreligious and Impious Tenets, with their Authors and Publi&s;hers, meet with no &s;uch Severity, but go on with Impunity, if not with Preferment, I &s;peak not this with the lea&s;t de&s;ign to encourage Legal Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t any

mi&s;taken Per&s;ons, who are of good Morals, and act up to the Laws of Nature, becau&s;e I am &s;atisfied that &s;uch Methods are Ineffectual, Unchri&s;tian, and Inhuman; but in my own Defence, and as a griev|ous Aggravation of the Hard&s;hips, peculiar Hard|&s;hips I meet with in this Ca&s;e. Thus I am not only joyn'd in the common Vogue, and popular Odium with Irreligious Per&s;ons, Hereticks and Bla&s;phemers, by the Famous Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> in his Tryal; I &s;ay by Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI>, who in his Pulpit with great Zeal Preaches &s;till again&s;t me, yet dares not do &s;o much out of it, as either Speak or Write one Word to me in his own Vindication, as my Printed Letter, yet unan&s;wer'd, demon&s;trates: But am Pro&s;ecuted in a Legal Court, in order to my Degradation, Ex|communication, and Impri&s;onment, by Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>, while tho&s;e other Per&s;ons, &s;o vehemently com|plain'd of by Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI>, and others not inferior to them in Guilt, do &s;till Write, and have Written, Printed and Publi&s;hed what they pleas'd, without Mole&s;tation, or any nice Enquiry about them. Nor do I find, that either Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>, or Dr. <HI>Sache|verell</HI>, or even the Drawer up of the Repre&s;enta|tion of the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation, who makes the &s;ame vehement Complaints with the la&s;t nam'd, have concerned them&s;elves about any &s;uch Pro&s;ecution. As if they had a greater Dread of the prevailing of that which, for ought they know, may be the real Original Doctrines and Laws of the Go&s;pel, than of the increa&s;e of undoubted Errors, notorious Here&s;ies, and gro&s;s Dei&s;m, if not Athei&s;m it &s;elf among us. And &s;ince Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> was allowed free Liberty before the highe&s;t Judicature of the Kingdom, to produce a va&s;t Number of In|&s;tances in that Ca&s;e, I hope this Court will permit me to produce a &s;maller Number in this, I mean &s;uch as the Doctor has pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence only; for as to tho&s;e that he has largely Collected, &s;uch
<PB N="61" REF="63">
as his Citations, from Mr. <HI>Hickeringill</HI>, The Au|thor of the Rights of the Chri&s;tian Church; Mr. <HI>Blunts</HI> Oracles of Rea&s;on; The Author of the Account of the growth of Dei&s;m; The Author of the Letter concerning Enthu&s;ia&s;m; The Author of the Hi&s;tory of Religion; Mr. <HI>A&s;gyl</HI>'s Argument; The Author of Chri&s;tianity not My&s;terious, and the Authors of the <HI>Review</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI>, they are &s;o well known, that there will be no nece&s;&s;ity for a Repe|tition. I the rather in&s;i&s;t upon the Parallel, becau&s;e I look upon the Pro&s;ecution of me to be on account of my open plainne&s;s, in a&s;&s;erting what upon the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiry I am &s;atisfy'd is no other than real Chri&s;tianity, as his was in part for his great Bold|ne&s;s in a&s;&s;erting what he believed to be the Do|ctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; tho', I doubt, without any con&s;iderable Enquiry whether it was agreeable to that Chri&s;tianity or not. For I am willing to hope, that to be a Confe&s;&s;or or Martyr for genuine Chri&s;tianity, is not le&s;s Meritorious than to be &s;o for the genuine Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; and that, how great a regard &s;oever this Court may have for the Laws of the Kingdom, and for the Opinions of the Church of <HI>England</HI> received there|in, yet that it will have a &s;till greater regard to the real Laws of the Go&s;pel, and to the original Do|ctrines of Chri&s;tianity. Tho' I cannot but complain that I have not yet met with any &s;ign of &s;uch &s;upe|rior regard, either in the Univer&s;ity, which ba|ni&s;hed me, or in the Convocation it &s;elf, which Cen&s;ured my Notions; and both of them before any proper Examination whether tho&s;e Notions were agreeable to Chri&s;tianity or not. However in hopes of a free and favourable hearing upon this Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall take leave to repre&s;ent to this Court &s;ome Books and Notions now current, as gro&s;sly Erroneous, and plainly Heretical, and much more proper for their Enquiry and Pro&s;ecution,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
than any of tho&s;e Primitive Doctrines of the Go|&s;pel, which I &s;tand here Accu&s;ed of. Now by &s;uch Doctrines as are plainly Heretical, I mean tho&s;e Condemned as Heretical by the Primitive Church, long before the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> (for after that time, I think, 'tis much harder to affirm what No|tions are really to be &s;o e&s;teemed:) And tho&s;e Here|ticks I refer to are, The <HI>Trithei&s;ts</HI>, the <HI>Ebionites</HI>, the <HI>Montani&s;ts</HI>, and the <HI>Sabellians</HI>. (1.) The <HI>Trithei&s;ts</HI>. The&s;e are mention'd among the olde&s;t <HI>Gentile</HI> He|reticks of all in the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions; and have been ever own'd as &s;uch from the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel till this very Day. And if there be &s;uch a thing as <HI>Here&s;y</HI> in the World, this mu&s;t for certain be one of the mo&s;t gro&s;s and undeniable In&s;tances of it. Since the Unity of God; or that there is properly but One Eternal, Unbegotten, Underived, Independant, and Ab&s;olutely Perfect Being, is the fir&s;t Doctrine taught by the <HI>Phaeno|mena</HI> of the World, and by Natural Religion, as well as by the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Revelations. Yet how many of late among us, and tho&s;e of great Name and Preferment al&s;o, have, and &s;till do &s;up|port what is little better than gro&s;s Trithei&s;m; I am not willing to enumerate. The Multitude and Greatne&s;s of Offenders generally prevent both the Ignominy and the Penalty due to the Offences: So I mu&s;t not complain that the <HI>Trithei&s;ts</HI>, or tho&s;e that a&s;&s;ert there are Three Gods, are not Puni&s;hed; becau&s;e then all the real <HI>Trinitarians</HI> among the Orthodox would be them&s;elves in very great Dan|ger on that Account. Tho' the Embracers of the Ancient Notion, which was above Three Hun|dred Years the mo&s;t general, if not the univer&s;al Doctrine of the Catholick Church, as I &s;hall hereaf|ter largely prove, cannot but think it exceeding hard that they mu&s;t be &s;till Stigmatiz'd and Pu|ni&s;hed as Hereticks, while tho&s;e that are little
<PB N="63" REF="65">
better than direct <HI>Tritheists</HI>, are not only not &s;o Stigmatiz'd nor Puni&s;hed at all, but are commonly in great Reputation and Preferment, as highly Or|thodox. 2. The <HI>Ebionites</HI>. The&s;e are mention'd in the &s;ame Con&s;titutions as <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hereticks, and that Pa&s;&s;age fully confirm'd as Genuine by <HI>Epiphanius</HI>, when he &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="inter"><HI>Haere&s;.</HI> XXX. &sect;. 24. p. 149.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;'Tis manife&s;t that All the Apo&s;tles reckon &endq;the <HI>Ebionites</HI> as Hereticks".</Q> Now the&s;e <HI>Ebionites</HI>, as reckon'd Hereticks here by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, were plainly &s;uch as pro|fe&s;s'd that our Saviour was a meer Man, and the Son of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mary:</HI> Tho' afterwards there aro&s;e another Sect of them that did not go &s;o far, but allow'd his Birth of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, by the over&s;hadowing of the Holy Gho&s;t; who were al&s;o, tho' in a le&s;&s;er degree, ever e&s;teemed Hereticks by the Primitive Church. I need not here tell you that our Modern <HI>Socinians</HI> agree with the later Branch of the&s;e <HI>Ebionites</HI>. Nor need I repre&s;ent what Numbers of their Books and Pamphlets were &s;ome Years &s;ince &s;cattered about among&s;t us. Both Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI>, and the Author of the Repre|&s;entation before-mention'd, have prevented me as to any Complaints upon this Head. Nor &s;hall I be&s;peak any farther Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t them in any Sen&s;e (farther I &s;ay, becau&s;e they have been almo&s;t the only Pretended Hereticks that have in &s;ome mea&s;ure of late been Pro&s;ecuted among us,) unle&s;s it be upon this Condition, that all the re&s;t that are as really and certainly Hereticks as they, may be as really and effectually Pro&s;ecuted with them: Which equal Condition, I believe, they them&s;elves will not refu&s;e. All I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on far|ther under the pre&s;ent Head is this, That the Church will not lo&s;e any Fundamental Doctrin of its Religion becau&s;e the <HI>Socinians</HI> embrace it; that it will not &s;o readily rank the <HI>Socinians</HI>, who go contrary
<PB N="64" REF="66">
to all Chri&s;tian Antiquity, with the <HI>Eu&s;ehians</HI> who have almo&s;t all Chri&s;tian Antiquity on their &s;ides; and that it will no longer &s;upport the oppo&s;ite Here&s;ies, and thereby give Occa&s;ion for any to run into &s;o great an extreme on the other &s;ide. (3) The <HI>Mon|tanists</HI>. I mean tho&s;e that follow <HI>Tertullian</HI>, in &s;uch his Heretical Doctrines about the Trinity, as we no where find the Catholicks of that Age acknow|ledged, and which he him&s;elf owns the greate&s;t part of Chri&s;tians were mightily afraid of, and e&s;teem'd contrary to the fir&s;t Article of their Creed. That the <HI>Montanists</HI> were e&s;teemed at that time, Hereticks, is known by all; and that their <HI>Paraclete</HI>, or pretended Spirit, that Guided them, did Confirm at lea&s;t, if not at fir&s;t, teach <HI>Tertullian</HI>, and his follow|ers, their Notions about the Trinity, we have his own expre&s;s Te&s;timony. So that <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Notions in this Matter, &s;eparate from that of the more Catholick Writers of the &s;ame Age, is no great Ad|vantage to any Opinions upon this Subject. Now a main Branch of <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Doctrines about the Trinity was, that tho' the Son of God, was not Coe|ternal with the Father, nor in &s;trictne&s;s equal to Him, but deriv'd from Him, and that the Spirit was deriv'd from the Father, by the Son, as &s;till more Inferior, yet that both the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit had <HI>one Substance common to them all</HI>, or that the Son was, as it were, a part of the Sub&s;tance of the Father; and the Holy Spirit, as it were, a part of the Sub&s;tance of the Son. Nay that Human Souls, were of the Sub&s;tance of God; and all this without the lea&s;t pretence to any Apo&s;tolical Autho|rity, or Tradition what&s;oever; and with the Ac|knowledgment of his borrowing &s;ome of his Lan|guage, if not of his Notions al&s;o, from the <HI>Valenti|nian</HI> Hereticks, before Him: all which Facts about <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;hall be Prov'd hereafter. How near the Here&s;y of <HI>Tertullian</HI> is to that of the later <HI>Homoou&s;i|ans</HI>,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
or tho&s;e <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> who, in a &s;trict and Philo|&s;ophical &s;ence, affirm that the Son, and Holy Spirit, are <HI>of the &s;ame E&s;&s;ence</HI> or <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantial with the Father</HI> I leave the Impartial to Determine. And I beg of the pre&s;ent Orthodox to con&s;ider what &s;mall Evidence they have for this &s;trict <HI>Con&s;ubstantiality</HI>, in three Centuries, when it is known, that the Term came fir&s;t from the old Hereticks; and that the earli|e&s;t and be&s;t Authority they have for this Doctrine in the Church, is the Wild Philo&s;ophy of the Here|tick <HI>Tertullian</HI>, Un&s;upported by all Sacred and real|ly Apo&s;tolical Evidence; and Condemn'd at <HI>Antioch</HI>, by one of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of the Ancient general Councils of the Church. The&s;e <HI>Homoou&s;ian</HI> Hereticks, therefore, as they were Anciently called, ought mo&s;t certainly to be fir&s;t Pro&s;ecuted, before the <HI>Eu&s;ebians</HI> are &s;o treated. The&s;e bold Preten|ders to know &s;uch things as were never revea$d; about the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI>, and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of the great Author of all things, and how it was Communicated, no$ only to the Son, but, by him, to the Holy Spirit al&s;o. The&s;e Introducers of Vain Philo&s;ophy into Chri&s;ti|anity, nay into Creeds, and Articles of Faith; with|out the U&s;e of, and A&s;&s;ent to which no Clergy Man &s;hall Officiate, nor Lay-man be e&s;teem'd &s;ound in the Faith; the&s;e Men I &s;ay, are tho&s;e that &s;hould fir&s;t be Di&s;courag'd, and Condemn'd, before any Pro&s;ecution is begun again&s;t others; E&s;pecially when it does not appear that the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf; which in a very much milder Sence, embrac'd the Con&s;ub&s;tantiality, would have born either the Elder <HI>Tertullian</HI>, or the later <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine about it; as will appear in due place hereafter. (4) The <HI>Sabellians</HI>, or tho&s;e ancient Hereticks, &s;o acknowledged by the whole Catholick Church, who Denyed the Real or Sub&s;tantial Di&s;tinction, between the Per&s;ons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and reduced the &s;ame to a <HI>Modal</HI> Difference

only. Yet how many, I pray, are there ju&s;tly chargeable with this Here&s;y at this Day? and that not only with Impunity, but with great Reputation and Preferment? for to pa&s;s over one Per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Clendon</HI>, who, by going out of his own Profe&s;&s;ion did unawares plainly own it in Print, and was Pro&s;e|cuted for it; how great a part of the pre&s;ent Ortho|dox are either directly, or very nearly <HI>Sabellians?</HI> I dare not name any names, they are &s;o Numerous, and &s;o Con&s;iderable; but that the thing in the General, has of late been too true, I appeal to the famous Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>, nay to the mo&s;t eminent Bi&s;hop <HI>Bull</HI> him&s;elf; who as they have declar'd mo&s;t fully and ju&s;tly, again&s;t that Notion in their Writings; &s;o do they freely own the Danger our Church is of late in of falling into it. Nor indeed are the&s;e <HI>Sabellians</HI>, which are now &s;o frequent among us, le&s;s Hereticks than the <HI>Socinians</HI> them&s;elves in this point. Only the latter do more commonly own their Do|ctrine in expre&s;s words; while the former do with le&s;s &s;incerity u&s;e all the Terms, Creeds, and Forms of the real <HI>Trinitarians</HI>, but without much more belief of what tho&s;e words Naturally Imply than the other: which In&s;incerity therefore, join'd to this Here&s;y it &s;elf, does certainly much more de&s;erve the Animadver&s;ion of the Publick, than al|mo&s;t any other bare Error, or even Here&s;y what&s;o|ever. But, ala&s;s! as I &s;aid, the Multitude, Character, and Intere&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Sabellians</HI>, as well as of the <HI>Tritheists</HI>, and <HI>Montanists</HI>, are too great and too Powerful to be Touch'd by me: and how va&s;tly &s;oever they are different from one another, yet do they u&s;ually Unite to Cru&s;h tho&s;e they call Here|ticks; nay even tho&s;e that avoid all Here&s;ies, and Re&s;olve to be only the genuine followers, of Original Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf in the&s;e Matters. Nor indeed can any complaints, be heard where the Majority is corrupted; &s;ince the <HI>most gro&s;s Hereticks</HI> will by
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;uch a Majority, certainly Vote them&s;elves <HI>Orthodox</HI>. All that I can therefore Hope for under this fir&s;t head of <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, which indeed cannot but be mo&s;t highly Rea&s;onable, is this, that tho&s;e more Numerous and undoubted Hereticks would have &s;o much common Charity le&s;t for tho&s;e that will not for&s;ake their more pure Chri&s;tianity for any Here&s;y what|&s;oever, as to cea&s;e all farther Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t them; and &s;uffer them to &s;erve God according to their own Per&s;ua&s;ions, and Con&s;ciences; le&s;t they Incur that Terrible Guilt, at la&s;t of fighting again&s;t <HI>God</HI>, and <HI>Per&s;ecuting the true Religion of Christ Je&s;us</HI>. I own, as to my &s;elf, that I am of all Men one of the mo&s;t fearful of falling into real Here&s;y; and that accordingly I dare not, upon any Modern Authority what&s;oever, go into either the <HI>Tritheistick</HI>, the <HI>Ebionite</HI>, the <HI>Montanist</HI> or the <HI>Sabellian</HI>, no not into the <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Here&s;ies. Yet am I &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Intire aver&s;ion which the Ble&s;&s;ed Author of our Religion ever &s;hew'd again&s;t all violence and per&s;ecution in &s;uch ca&s;es, that I think, one of the fir&s;t things that is now nece&s;&s;ary in order to the admi&s;&s;ion of any one into &s;o much as a Society for Enquiry into Chri&s;tianity, is to promi&s;e, he will have no hand in Per&s;ecuting any hone&s;t Men on account of Religion. And how far the Temper of &s;ome Pre&s;ent Pro&s;ecutors in this Church is contrary to Chri&s;tianity, will de|&s;erve your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration now, le&s;t by degrees this in part Reformed Church of <HI>England</HI>, which was &s;o long and &s;o vehemently Per&s;ecuted by the Papi&s;ts formerly as Heretical, &s;hould, ere it is aware, it &s;elf degenerate into the like wicked and antichri&s;tian Spirit of Per&s;ecution, and that under the &s;ame pretence of Heretical Notions al&s;o. <HI>Principiis Obsta, Sero medicina paratur.

The only Authentick Rules, or Standards by which Errors and Here&s;ies can be Judged of; I take to be the&s;e Four: (1) The Original Chri&s;tian Rule of Faith, which is no other than the Bapti&s;mal Creed and Profe&s;&s;ion. (2) The Sacred and Cano|nical Books of the New Te&s;tament. (3) The mo&s;t Ancient, whether Apo&s;tolical or Primitive Writings of the three former Centuries, before the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>.

All therefore that I &s;hall have occa&s;ion here to ob|&s;erve is this, that no other Rule or Standard, no Modern Laws of any Country, no Canons or Con|&s;titutions of any pre&s;ent Church, can be at all &s;et again&s;t tho&s;e other Rules, nor ought to have any di&s;tinct Weight in this Ca&s;e. This indeed $word$ &s;o rea|&s;onable, that I might ju&s;tly take it for granted: but becau&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI>, or at lea&s;t no$ $word$ few of her leading Members, do of late begin to &s;$$ up on the foot of Legal Settlements, and to in&s;i&s;t that
<PB N="71" REF="73">
&s;he is the <HI>Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law</HI>; &s;ince they have now their main Recour&s;e to later human Canons, Con&s;titutions, and Articles, as confirmed or &s;uppo|&s;ed in Acts of Parliament, and own'd in Civil as well as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts among us: Since many now do in my Ca&s;e plead that <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law I ought</HI> to be Depriv'd, Excommunicated, and Impri&s;oned, without any farther Con&s;iderations: And &s;ince Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> does, in this Pro&s;ecution, &s;eem to depend entirely on this Legal Method, without any previous Regard to rational Debates, learned Con|ferences, or fair Examination at all; as indeed the other Pro&s;ecutions again&s;t me have depended &s;till up|on the &s;ame Foundation hitherto; I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;ome|what to this Plea; and &s;hew why I do not at all Ap|peal to any &s;uch modern and uncertain Rules in my pre&s;ent Vindication; nor am much concern'd if they appear to be again&s;t me in any of the&s;$ Articles. The Particulars I &s;hall therefore in&s;i&s;t upon under this Head &s;hall be the&s;e Four: (1.) That all &s;uch modern Rules, as to the fundamental Doctrines and Duties of Chri&s;tianity, and as un&s;upported by better Evidence, mu&s;t be allow'd by all, e&s;pecially by all Prote&s;tants, to be of no Authority. (2.) That in &s;pecial the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is ever of the &s;ame Mind, and wholly depends, as to the fundamental Doctrines or Duties of the Go&s;pel, on tho&s;e ancient Foundations only. (3.) That the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>England</HI> has al&s;o fully declar'd it&s;elf of the &s;ame Mind by Act of Parlia|ment. (4.) That accordingly the greate&s;t, and the mo&s;t eminent and learned of the Members of our Church do not guide them&s;elves by any &s;uch mo|dern Rules, but embrace Opinions quite different from the &s;ame, whenever they find Scripture and Antiquity are again&s;t them. (1) I plead that the&s;e modern Rules, as to &s;uch main Points of old Chri|&s;tianity, and as un&s;upported by better Evidence, mu&s;t be allow'd by all, e&s;pecially by all Prote&s;tants,
<PB N="72" REF="74">
to be of no Authority. This is the common Voice of Nature and Rea&s;on, that Facts done, Doctrines taught, Laws made, and Articles of Faith &s;ettled by any, between 1600 and 1700 Years ago, can no way be di&s;cover'd now by Facts done, Laws made, Canons &s;etled, and Articles agreed to at this va&s;t Di&s;tance of Time afterward To &s;uppo&s;e other|wi&s;e is to &s;uppo&s;e that this Church of <HI>England</HI> had its Wor&s;hip in a known Tongue, and denied Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation in the Days of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, becau&s;e it does &s;o now: 'Tis to &s;uppo&s;e that the cor|rupt Traditions of the Elders in our Saviour's Days, mu&s;t imply that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf delivered the &s;ame to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation originally; and that the Hi&s;to|ry of one Age need not be taken from the Writers of the &s;ame Age, but may be learn'd by the Hi&s;to|ry of another, above a Thou&s;and Years after it. Nay indeed this is not only a thing entirely ab&s;urd in its own Nature, but it is peculiarly &s;o in Prote|&s;tants, who have left the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> upon this very Principle, that the Chri&s;tian Religion was to $word$ taken from Scripture and Antiquity, and not from the later Articles, Con&s;titutions, or Practices of the Chruch; and who have ventur'd upon the Foot of this Rea&s;oning, to introduce a great Refor|mation into Chri&s;tendom. And indeed I hardly know any thing more ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable, than for a Church to build its entire Settlements on this Principle, that former Ages have been &s;o gro&s;sly de|ceiv'd, and have &s;o gro&s;sly deceiv'd others in Mat|ters of Religion, that there can no Dependance be had on their Decrees and Doctrines, without imme|diate Recour&s;e to the Originals them&s;elves; and then, after a new Settlement is introduc'd on this Principle, to leave it again, and to have Recour&s;e to the like later Decrees and Doctrines, without Re|gard to tho&s;e Originals any longer. As if the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> indeed were mi&s;erably deceiv'd in
<PB N="73" REF="75">
tho&s;e particular Points which our fir&s;t Reformers happened to examine and correct; but that, as to all others, &s;he is of the mo&s;t &s;acred and infallible Au|thority: Or, as if this Church of <HI>England</HI> had in|deed &s;eparated from an erroneous Church, out of Regard to Primitive Chri&s;tianity; but was now grown &s;o Infallible her&s;elf, that &s;he needed not to have Recour&s;e to that Primitive Chri&s;tianity any longer. But this is impo&s;&s;ible to be fairly &s;uppos'd in our Ca&s;e, becau&s;e (2.) The Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular ever declares that it depends not on any modern Decrees, Con&s;titutions, or Laws, in any &s;uch important Doctrines or Duties of the Go&s;|pel, but on the other In&s;pired and mo&s;t Primitive Records of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf only. This we learn from her XXXIX. Articles, her Publick Liturgy, and her Homilies them&s;elves; &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages out of every one of which I &s;hall take Leave to produce upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Thus &s;ays the VI. Article <Q>&startq;Holy Scripture containeth all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. So that what&s;oever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it &s;hould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requi&s;ite or nece&s;&s;ary to &endq;Sal|vation".</Q></P>
<P>Thus the VIII. Article implies, <Q>&startq;That the very &endq;Creeds them&s;elves, or mo&s;t Sacred Profe&s;&s;ions of Faith u&s;ed in this Church, are therefore to be &startq;received and believed, becau&s;e they may be proved by mo&s;t certain warrant of Holy &endq;Scrip|ture".</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus the XIX. XX. and XXI. Articles affirm, "That the mo&s;t Famous and Patriarchal Churches, &s;uch as tho&s;e of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>, of <HI>Alexandria</HI>, of <HI>Antioch</HI>, &startq;and of <HI>Rome</HI>, have Erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but al&s;o in Matters of Faith. And that it is not Lawful for the
<PB N="74" REF="76">
Church to Ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written; and may not &s;o Expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another: That, as it ought not to Decree any thing again&s;t the &s;ame, &s;o that be&s;ides the &s;ame, it ought not to enforce any thing to be be|lieved, for nece&s;&s;ity of Salvation. That even General Councils them&s;elves are A&s;&s;emblies of Men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God; and not only may Err, but &s;ometime have Erred, even in Things pertaining unto God; and that therefore Things Ordained by them, as nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, have neither Strength nor Authority, unle&s;s it may be declared &endq;that they be taken out of Holy Scripture".</Q> Thus in the XXIV. Article, Prayer in an unknown Tongue is therefore Cen&s;ured, becau&s;e it is a thing, how agreeable &s;oever to &s;ome Modern Laws, Canons and Practice, <Q>&startq;Plainly Repugnant to the Word of &endq;God, and the Cu&s;tom of the Primitive Church".</Q> In XXV. and XXVIII. The carrying about the Eucha|ri&s;t in Proce&s;&s;ion, is therefore Cen&s;ured, becau&s;e, "It was not Ordained of Chri&s;t for &s;uch Purpo&s;es". In the XXVIII Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is rejected, <Q>&startq;Be|cau&s;e it cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is &endq;Repugnant to the plain Words of Scripture".</Q> In the XXXII. The Clergy are allowed to Marry, notwith&s;tanding the Churches later Determinations to the contrary, becau&s;e <Q>&startq;They are not command|ed by God's Law either to vow the E&s;tate of &s;in|gle &endq;Life, or to ab&s;tain from Marriage."</Q> And it is added that <Q>&startq;Therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Chri&s;tian Men, to marry at their own &endq;Di&s;cretion."</Q> And in the XXXIV. Any Human Traditions and Ceremonies are allow'd, &s;o far only <Q>&startq;That nothing be ordained again&s;t God's Word, or tho&s;e alone which be not repugnant to the Word of &endq;God."</Q> So that 'tis mo&s;t evident, as to the&s;e im|portant
<PB N="75" REF="77">
or fundamental Points, which, if any, are to be &s;uppos'd nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, and about which, if any, Here&s;y is concern'd, our XXX$X. Arti|cles do utterly di&s;claim any human or modern Autho|rity; and entirely refer us to the Scriptures, and the Primitive Records of our Religion, for our Guidance and Direction about them.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to the Common Prayer Book, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Act of Uniformity. And here we meet, in the very Preface, with a Declaration of the Compilers, that they are &s;o far from the Pre|tence of Infallibility, that <Q>&startq;They hope for, and in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch ju&s;t and favourable Con&s;truction, as in common Equity ought to be allow'd to all hu|man Writings, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are &s;et forth by Authority, and even to the very be&s;t Tran&s;lations &endq;of the Holy Scripture it&s;elf," e're they pretend to ju&s;tify the former Common Prayer Book.</Q> And they &s;uppo&s;e that <Q>&startq;It mu&s;t not have contained any thing contrary to the Word of God, or to &s;ound &endq;Doctrine," upon &s;uch an equitable Interpretation, or el&s;e it mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all its Legal Autho|rity, have been given up as plainly indefen&s;ible.</Q> Accordingly, in its Catechi&s;m, and Forms of Bap|ti&s;m, and Confirmation, it obliges the Catechumons to engage for nothing on the&s;e Heads, but <Q>&startq;The &endq;Belief of the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith," and among tho&s;e Articles it enumerates not one of the novel conte&s;ted Doctrines, that occur in the <HI>Ni|cene</HI> or <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Creeds, but is content with tho&s;e more undoubted and primitive ones in that a&s;cribed to the Apo&s;tles: and allows only two Sacraments, and tho&s;e not as of human, but of Chri&s;t's own In|&s;titution.</Q> In the Preface to its Offices for Ordina|tion, it pleads for the three Orders of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons only from <Q>&startq;The Holy Scrip|ture, &endq;and the Ancient Authors;" and Orders part of the Examination of a Deacon to be, &startq;Whether he
<PB N="76" REF="78">
be in&s;tructed in the Holy Scripture? Whether he infeignedly believes all the Canonical Scrip|tures of the Old and New Te&s;tament? Whe|ther he will apply all his Diligence to frame and fa&s;hion his own Life, and the Lives of his Family, according to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t? It Exhorts Presbyters, that &s;ince they cannot by any other Means do their Duty, but by Doctrine and Ex|hortation taken out of the Holy Scriptures, and by a Life agreeable to the &s;ame; to be &s;tudious in reading and learning tho&s;e Scriptures; and in framing the Manners both of them&s;elves, and of them that &s;pecially pertain unto them, according to the Rule of the &s;ame Scriptures. And that they are to pray continually to God the Father, by the Mediation of our only Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &endq;for the Heavenly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t," <HI>the very Model of Wor&s;hip that I contend for</HI>, and that it will be expected from them, that &startq;By daily reading and weighing of the Scriptures, they wax riper and &s;tronger in their Mini&s;try, and are to fa&s;hion the Lives of them and theirs after &endq;the Rule and Doctrine of Chri&s;t"</Q> Some of the main Engagements they are to take upon them are the&s;e, <Q>&startq;That they are per&s;waded that the Holy Scriptures contain &s;ufficiently all Doctrine requi|red of Nece&s;&s;ity for eternal Salvation, through Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that they are deter|mined out of the &s;ame Scriptures to in&s;truct the People committed to their Charge; and to teach nothing (as required of Nece&s;&s;ity to eternal Sal|vation) but that which <HI>they &s;hall be per&s;waded</HI> may be concluded and proved by the Scripture: That they will be ready with all faithful Diligence to bani&s;h and drive away all erroneous and &s;trange Doctrines, contrary to God's Word; and will be diligent in Prayers, and in reading of the Ho|ly Scriptures, and in &s;uch Studies as help to the

&endq;Knowledge of the &s;ame."</Q> The&s;e are part of the &s;olemn Engagements of all Deacons and Pre&s;|byters with us: which I the rather in&s;i&s;t on, be|cau&s;e I have taken both tho&s;e Orders in this Church, and made the&s;e Promi&s;es; and becau&s;e every Presby|ter's <HI>own Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI>, as to the Agreement of fundamen|tal Doctrines with the Script$$$, is here made their Standard; and they are to teach them <HI>accoding to that their own Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI>, and not otherwi&s;e. Which Ob|ligations I having mo&s;t exactly comply'd with, I cannot but think it very hard to be pro&s;ecuted for doing &s;o. Nor need I enlarge upon the next Form, that for Ordaining of Bi&s;hops; &s;ince it does not belong to me; and &s;ince it is &s;o much of a piece with the former in this Matter. Only we may re|mark one Addition, wherein not the Holy Scrip|ture only, but the <HI>Ancient Canons</HI> are introduced as of con&s;iderable Authority among Chri&s;tians; in a &s;till greater Agreement with the forementioned pri|mitive Rules and Standards. So that 'tis evident the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> makes the <HI>Scrip|ture, Antiquity</HI>, and the <HI>Old Canons</HI>, and not any late Opinions or Decrees, the Mea&s;ure of judging about Doctrines of this Con&s;equence in the Chri|&s;tian Religion. Let us now proceed to the Book of Homilies, which the XXXVth Article of our Church declares to <Q>&startq;Contain good and whol&s;ome Doctrine, &endq;and nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e Times;" and which are accordingly &s;till ordered by Publick Authority to be read in our Churches And here in&s;tead of recom|mending any Human Con&s;titutions, this Book be|gins with &startq;A Fruitful Exhortation to the Reading &endq;and Knowledge of Holy Scripture."</Q> The Pre|face begins with Ob&s;erving <Q>&startq;The Nece&s;&s;ity there is of Preaching the Word of God; and that it is the only Food of the Soul, in order to the Peo|ples learning their Duty, according to the Mind of the Holy Gho&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed in the Scriptures;
<PB N="78" REF="80">
and to the avoiding the manifold Enormities, which heretofore, by fal&s;e Doctrine, had crept into the Church of God. That the&s;e Homilies were Publi&s;hed to this very End, that by the true &s;etting forth, and pure declaring of God's Word, which is the principal Guide and Leader unto all Godline&s;s and Virtue, they might expel and drive away as well corrupt, vicious, and un|godly Living, as Erroneous and Poi&s;oned Do|ctrines, &endq;tending to Super&s;tition and Idolatry."</Q> The fir&s;t Homily begins al&s;o with declaring, that <Q>&startq;Unto a Chri&s;tian Man there can be nothing ei|ther more nece&s;&s;ary or profitable than the Know|ledge of Holy Scripture; and that there is no Truth nor Doctrine nece&s;&s;ary for our Ju&s;tification and everla&s;ting Salvation, but that is or may be &endq;drawn out of that Fountain and Well of Truth."</Q> It afterwards exhorts Men <Q>&startq;Diligently to &s;earch for the Well of Life, in the Books of the New and Old Te&s;tament, and not run to the &s;tinking Puddles of Mens Tradition, devi&s;ed by Mens Imagination, for our Ju&s;tification and Salvation; becau&s;e in Holy Scripture is fully contain'd what we ought to do, and what to e&s;chew; what to believe, what to love, and what to look for at God's Hand at Length; and becau&s;e in the&s;e Books we &s;hall find the Father <HI>from</HI> whom; the Son <HI>by</HI> whom; and the Holy Gho&s;t <HI>in</HI> whom all &endq;Things have their Being and Keeping up:" (<HI>which is &s;o far the very Original Doctrine of the Tri|nity which I am here contending for.</HI>)</Q> But it would be tedious to repeat all that the Homily contains of this Nature; So I forbear: And only Ob&s;erve that the very &s;ame great Di&s;regard for all later Human Decrees and Determinations, and the &s;ame high Regard to the Scripture, and the other Primitive Books of our Religion, appear in the&s;e Homilies, that we found before in the Articles and Liturgy

of our Church, as to tho&s;e great and fundamental Doctrines we are now concern'd about. And tho' it cannot be deny'd that our fir&s;t Reformers were, in their own Opinions, <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>, as having never brought that Matter under any Examination; and that accordingly they have left but too many Te&s;ti|monies of that their Opinion every where, nay even by burning &s;ome that would not renounce the oppo&s;ite Doctrine; yet is it mo&s;t evident that this was all done before the Controver&s;y was &s;tart|ed, or they were appriz'd of the Arguments on the contrary Side; before the Ancient Writers had been con&s;ulted, or the fir&s;t Councils of the Church enquired into thereupon; before they had heard of any other oppo&s;ite Notion in the fourth Century than the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y it&s;elf; before there had ari&s;en any Evidence for another Reading or Tran&s;lation of &s;ome of the principal Texts on which the common Notions much depended; and while the Reformers &s;eem to have been as fully per&s;uaded that the <HI>Atha|na&s;ian</HI> Doctrine was clearly and fully contain'd in the Scripture, as any fundamental Doctrine of the Go&s;|pel it&s;elf. So that it is mo&s;t evident from their whole Conduct, that had the Ancient or <HI>Eu&s;ebian</HI> Doctrine been laid &s;o plainly before them, and &s;o fully demon&s;trated to be no part of the <HI>Arian</HI> He|re&s;y, but the original, pure, and uncorrupt Do|ctrine of the Bapti&s;mal Creed, of the Holy Scrip|tures, of the <HI>Antenicene</HI> Fathers, and of the earlie&s;t Councils, as this is now laid and demon&s;trated before the pre&s;ent Church, they would plainly not have ap|pointed a Court to puni&s;h, but a Committee to examine: They would not, for certain, have &s;train'd &s;ome old Popi&s;h Canons to convict the Propo&s;ers of Here&s;y; but would have try'd all by the Holy Scriptures, and the Primitive Writers; they would not have encouraged a Per&s;on in Holy Orders to turn In|former in an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court again&s;t a Brother

Clergyman, who had hone&s;tly and throughly &s;tu|died the Point him&s;elf, and de&s;ir'd others to &s;tudy it likewi&s;e; but would have been glad of better Light, and have endeavour'd hone&s;tly to correct all modern Errors, and to reduce all to the Primitive Standard. This, I &s;ay, our fir&s;t Reformers mu&s;t have done by their Principles, and would, in all Pro|bability, have done in Practice, out of that Hone&s;ty and Integrity which they &s;hew'd in all the other like Ca&s;es of modern Corruptions crept into the Church. And this is all I expect from the pre&s;ent Churches. (3.) I plead that the Scripture and Antiquity, and not any modern Rules or Articles, mu&s;t be the Guides to judge of great Errors and Here&s;y by in this Nation, becau&s;e the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Eng|land</HI>, as well as the <HI>Church</HI>, has declar'd it&s;elf fully on this Point, and that in the mo&s;t Authentick Man|ner po&s;&s;ible, that is, by Act of Parliament. This is a Matter perhaps more proper for my Councel than for my&s;elf to plead in my Behalf. Yet give me Leave, &s;ince it comes &s;o properly in my way, to mention it my&s;elf al&s;o upon this Occa&s;ion. And indeed it being the principal, if not only Clau&s;e in any Act of Parliament &s;ince the Reformation, that directly meddles with this Matter; and it be|ing very full and expre&s;s on my Side of the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion; I &s;hall take Leave to &s;et down that Clau&s;e entirely, as containing the Authentick Prote&s;tant Rule for &s;uch High Courts to judge of Here&s;y by. And it is in the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Provided always, and be it Enacted by the Authority afore&s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="inter"><HI>1.</HI> Eliz.</NOTE> that &s;uch Per&s;on or Per|&s;ons to whom your Highne&s;s, your Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall hereafter, by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI>, give Authority to have or execute any Juri&s;diction, Power, or Authority Spiritual, or to vi&s;it, reform, order, or correct any Errors, Here&s;ies, Schi&s;ms, Abu&s;es, or Enormities

by vertue of this Act, &s;hall not in any wi&s;e have Authority or Power to order, determine, or adjudge any Matter or Cau&s;e to be Here&s;y, but only &s;uch as heretofore have been determined, ordered or ad|judged to be Here&s;y by the Authority of the Cano|nical Scriptures, or [as] by the fir&s;t four General Councils, or any of them, or by any other General Council, wherein the &s;ame was declared Here&s;y by the expre&s;s and plain Words of the &s;aid Canonical Scriptures, or &s;uch as hereafter &s;hall be ordered, judged, or determined to be Here&s;y by the High Court of Parliament of this Realm, with the A&s;&s;ent &endq;of the Clergy in their Convocation.</Q> Here we &s;ee, that when the Prote&s;tant Legi&s;lature came to make a &s;tanding Rule for even &s;uch an High Court as this now is; acting by a Royal Commi&s;&s;ion, as this Court now does; about that very Crime of Here&s;y which this Court now &s;its upon, it allows of no later Ca|nons or Decrees of this or any modern Churches, as Rules for judging of Here&s;y by, but entirely ex|cludes them. It re&s;trains all to the Sacred Scrip|tures, and to the Determinations of the earlie&s;t Ge|neral Councils from them. It excludes either all the General Councils in general, or however all &s;ince the fifth Century, from any proper Authority at all; nay it will not tru&s;t the Convocation, the Legal Repre&s;entative of the Church of <HI>England</HI>, with Vo|ting any thing el&s;e to be Here&s;y without the A&s;&s;ent of the Parliament it&s;elf al&s;o. So that I think this is &s;ufficient Evidence of the Sen&s;e of the Prote&s;tant <HI>State</HI> of <HI>England</HI>, as the foregoing was of the Prote|&s;tant <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in this Matter. (4.) The greate&s;t, the mo&s;t eminent and learned of the Members of our Church do not guide them&s;elves by any &s;uch modern Rules, but embrace Opinions quite different from the &s;ame, whenever they find Scripture and Antiquity again&s;t them. This A&s;&s;er|tion is &s;o very true and certain in this as well as
<PB N="28" REF="84">
other Churches, that 'tis only the Vulgar, the Un|learned, and the Unthinking that frame their Opi|nions according to any &s;uch modern Con&s;titutions; while the Great, the Learned, and the Con&s;idering Men have little or no Regard to them at all in their inward Sentiments; whatever Sub&s;criptions, or A&s;|&s;ent and Con&s;ent, whatever common Forms of Creeds, or Articles, or Prayers, they, out of Re|gard to Publick Peace, to Preferment, or to Self-Pre&s;ervation, do generally comply with. This is &s;aid to be very remarkable in the Church of <HI>France</HI>; where tho&s;e that intimately know their Learned Men, do al&s;o perceive how little Influence the pub|lick Sub&s;criptions and Forms of the Popi&s;h Religion, &s;ubmitted to by them, really have upon their Minds and inward Per&s;ua&s;ions. Nor is this much le&s;s re|markable in the Learned Men of our Church; and as to many Points, in almo&s;t all the con&s;iderable Members of it, among the Unlearned them&s;elves. This A&s;&s;ertion &s;hall be prov'd, not by enumerating &s;ome particular Churchmens Opinions, in Oppo&s;i|tion to the publick and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Notions, Do|ctrines, or Practices of the Church; which Method would be liable to great Objections; but by pro|ducing &s;everal In&s;tances in the Churches mo&s;t Au|thentick Acts, of &s;uch A&s;&s;ertions, which we all know the Learned, nay commonly the very Un|learned them&s;elves of our Communion do not, can|not a&s;&s;ent to; as being di&s;cover'd to be Mi&s;takes, and un&s;upported by, if not contrary to, the Scrip|ture, and Primitive Antiquity; and are accord|ingly of very little or no Authority among us. I mean all this according to the u&s;ual, obvious, known Sen&s;e of Words, as they naturally &s;ignify, or were certainly meant by tho&s;e that at fir&s;t im|po&s;ed them; for otherwi&s;e we have no Mea&s;ure nor Standard to know any Man's Opinions by at all; nor, in &s;uch a Latitude of Interpretation, as is u&s;ed

Thus, to in&s;tance in our XXXIX. Ar|ticles: Tho' they be &s;igned by every Clergyman, nay commonly at the Univer&s;ity by young Scholars, long before they are Clergymen; and I believe fre|quently before they know any thing of them, or indeed ever read them; yet do I de&s;ire to know where any Learned Men of our Church do really and truly, in the obvious Sen&s;e of the Words, be|lieve all of them? I profe&s;s I have not met with one in all my Conver&s;ation. I have al&s;o liv'd many Years in one of our Famous Univer&s;ities: In which the XVII. or Prede&s;tinarian Article in particular was &s;o far from being generally believ'd, that Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI>, who profe&s;&s;ed &s;till to believe it there, &s;eems to have been almo&s;t &s;ingular and alone by him&s;elf in &s;uch his Belief thereof: And u&s;ed in|deed, as he has no &s;mall Pretence, to triumph over the Univer&s;ity and the Church on that account; as tho' he alone were in tho&s;e Points a true Churchman, and they De&s;erters of their very Articles. Nor will I be &s;o injurious to Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> him&s;elf as to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;o far a <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> as to believe it; tho' he be now pro&s;ecuting me for my disbelieving other Articles, which &s;tand upon much the &s;ame Autho|rity with this. But to come to other Particulars. What really Learned and Judicious Member of the Church of <HI>England</HI> does now believe that Chri&s;t truly <HI>went down into Hell</HI>, in the vulgar Sen&s;e of that Term in our Language, as the III. Article, and the common Creed a&s;&s;ert? or a&s;&s;ents to that Definition of Her Canonical Books, that <Q>&startq;They are &s;uch, of who&s;e Authority was never any Doubt in the &endq;Church;" as the VI. Article affirms:</Q> While all the Learned very well know that &s;everal of tho&s;e Books, which we all own for Canonical, have been
<PB N="84" REF="86">
doubted of in the Church, and that in early Ages al&s;o. What really Great and Good Men can affirm withthe$ VIII. Article, <Q>&startq;That not only that called the Apo&s;tles Creed, but the <HI>Nice</HI> Creed, and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s al&s;o, may be proved by mo&s;t certain &endq;Warrant of Holy Scripture;" while 'tis known that the New Articles in the fir&s;t, and no &s;mall part of the &s;econd, are at lea&s;t un&s;upported by tho&s;e Scriptures, if not plainly again&s;t the whole Current of them.</Q> And for the Damnatory Sentences, they rather create an Horror in the Minds of tho&s;e good Chri&s;tians that are throughly vers'd in the Holy Scriptures, or even the ancienter Creeds and Wri|tings of the Primitive Chri&s;tians. Where, by the way, I de&s;ire it may be Ob&s;erv'd that none of the&s;e Creeds are really what they pretend to be: That Creed here &s;aid to be commonly called the Apo&s;tles Creed, tho' it be much the be&s;t, is not theirs, and indeed cannot be found within the fir&s;t Four Hun|dred Years; that here called the <HI>Nice</HI> Creed is not the Creed of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, but of the Coun|cil of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>, held 56 Years after; and that here called <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Creed, was not made by <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>; but at the &s;oone&s;t by a Counterfeiter of Books under his Name, above 100 Years after his Death. I de&s;ire al&s;o it may be noted farther, that the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Creed was not admitted into the pub|lick Service of the Church, till about 1000 Years after our Saviour, in the very mid&s;t of Popi&s;h Ig|norance and Super&s;tition: And al&s;o that its Admi&s;|&s;ion at fir&s;t, and its Continuance &s;till is in open De|fiance of the Decrees of the third and fourth Gene|ral Councils, receiv'd by our Church; both which forbid the Introduction of any Creed after that of <HI>Nice</HI>, as improv'd by the Council of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s Manner imaginable. All which A&s;&s;ertions I am ready to prove by the mo&s;t Authen|tick Evidence, and even by the known Conce&s;&s;ions

of the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves, if this Court plea&s;e to permit me &s;o to do.

Article, when it directly declares that <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith only</HI>. Nor indeed do they I believe generally care to pronounce with the XIII. Article, that <Q>&startq;Works done before Regene|ration &endq;have the Nature of Sin."</Q> And to give an In&s;tance or two from our Liturgy, The Rubrick after the Bapti&s;m of Infants affirms, with great A&s;&s;u|rance, that <Q>&startq;'Tis certain by God's Word, that Children which are Baptized, dying before they &endq;commit actual Sin, are undoubtedly &s;aved;" which of the Learned can be &s;atisfied with this, while they cannot but know that there is nothing about it in God's Word; and when the &s;ame Li|turgy al&s;o in the proper Preface for Trinity Sunday has the&s;e Words; &startq;We give Thanks unto thee, O Lord, Almighty, Everla&s;ting God; who art One God, One Lord, not One only Per&s;on, but Three Per&s;ons in One Sub&s;tance. For that which we believe of the Glory of the Father, the &s;ame we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, without any Difference or Inequality."

of all the modern Churches; which tho' com|ply'd with, in &s;ome Sen&s;e or other, for the Sake of Peace and Preferment, yet are by no Means believ'd by the truly Learned and Judicious in any of their Communions.</P>
<P>And now I dare appeal to all the World, whether &s;uch uncertain Articles and A&s;&s;ertions as the&s;e, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them, are proper Standards where|by to determine what is Here&s;y or Error by the Chri|&s;tian Religion? Are the particular Opinions of &s;ome of our fir&s;t Reformers, in the Infancy of Learn|ing, to be advanc'd high enough to condemn tho&s;e that have di&s;cover'd &s;ome better Truths, to a Pri&s;on during Life? Are &s;uch weak and human Determi|nations of one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Synod <HI>A D</HI> 1562. to Pre|judge all Doctrines that do not ju&s;t &s;quare with their Model? Are &s;uch Articles, which many of the greate&s;t of our Divines have affirm'd, and al|mo&s;t all have wi&s;h'd that they had been made as Articles of Peace only; many of which are believ'd by very few; nay are forc'd to have unnatural Sen&s;es put on their Words to make them at all tolerable; Are, I &s;ay, &s;uch Articles to be deem'd equivalent to the Rule of Faith, to the Holy Scriptures, to the mo&s;t Primitive Fathers, and to the fir&s;t Councils of the Church? This is &s;o gro&s;s and ab&s;urd, and con|trary to Dr. <HI>Henchman</HI>'s own Pleading about the Authority of Scripture, that had I not heard &s;ome of Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI>'s Council, and even Dr. <HI>Henchman</HI>, in Contradiction to him&s;elf, in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch weak Topicks, I &s;hould hardly believe it po&s;&s;ible for Men of Learning in their &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions to &s;upport a Notion &s;o utterly indefen&s;ible. Tho' indeed this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that in Ca&s;e our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts are fond of judging about Error and Here&s;y, and of Condemning the Erroneous and Hereticks, they need only Determine that the old Popi&s;h Canons, toge|ther with our own 39 Articles, and the like modern
<PB N="87" REF="89">
Con&s;titutions, are the Mea&s;ures and Standards of Orthodoxy, and that all Denyal of them is either Here&s;y, or at lea&s;t &s;o gro&s;s an Error as will incur the &s;ame Puni&s;hment with Here&s;y, and they may have no &s;mall Part of the Nation of all Per&s;ua&s;ions into their Courts immediately: And, unle&s;s they will recant, into their Pri&s;ons al&s;o. Only I de&s;ire they would con&s;ider the Con&s;equence of all this before it be too late; le&s;t tho&s;e that in one Year or one Reign &s;it as Judges, or plead as Council on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, &s;hould in another &s;tand here them&s;elves as Criminals, as I am oblig'd now to do; and this with &s;o much the le&s;s Pity, as they will be con&s;cious of their own Guilt, and bitterly remember how they <HI>digged the Pit, and are $allen them&s;elves into the De&s;truction that they made for others</HI>.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. As I have already laid down the Original Standards of judging about the fundamental Do|ctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and of determining what are dangerous Errors and Here&s;ies therein; &s;o do I de|&s;ire Leave, before I begin my proper Defence, to explain my&s;elf here more particularly about the &s;pecial Rules and Mea&s;ures by which I &s;hall go in that Defence; that &s;o it may be as plain, authen|tick, and unexceptionable as may be. Under this Head therefore I de&s;ire this Court to Note, (1.) That I reckon the Con&s;titutions of the Apo|&s;tles, as well as <HI>Clement</HI>'s two Epi&s;tles, among the Books of Canonical Scripture; &s;ince they appear now in all the Copies of that original Canon, and appear to have been in the &s;ame from the beginning. Nor &s;hall I make any Scruple of joining the <HI>Revela|tion</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI> to the Canonical Books, tho' it be in no Copy of that Canon; becau&s;e I find no other Rea&s;on for its Omi&s;&s;ion therein, but that it was not then written when the Canon was made. Nor indeed &s;hall I make any very great Di&s;tinction between tho&s;e and the other Apo&s;tolical Fathers Writings,
<PB N="88" REF="90">
not now in the Canon; becau&s;e the Rea&s;on why they al&s;o were not in that Canon &s;eems to me to be the &s;ame; <HI>viz.</HI> That they were not then written: And becau&s;e their Authority is by all owned to be next to that of the Canonical Books them&s;elves, and va&s;tly &s;uperior to that of the Primitive Fathers who came afterwards. (2.) That in quoting the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ignatius</HI>, Bi&s;hop of <HI>Antioch</HI>, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the larger Epi&s;tles only, &s;ince I have fully prov'd that they are the genuine Epi&s;tles, and this hitherto without Reply; and &s;o far, at lea&s;t, to the &s;atis|faction of the Learned, that have examin'd that Matter, that they &s;eem to me commonly to allow, that if either &s;ort of Epi&s;tles be genuine, the larger alone are to be allow'd for &s;uch. (3) As to the <HI>Antenicene</HI> Fathers, I properly except again&s;t none u&s;ually e&s;teem'd Catholick by the Learned; and only have le&s;s value for <HI>Tertullian</HI> than for the re&s;t, becau&s;e He was certainly a <HI>Montanist</HI> Heretick; as I have already ob&s;erv'd. (4) As to Matters of Fact, and &s;econd hand Quotations, I except only again&s;t one Per&s;on, who for very good Rea&s;ons, cannot be depended on in &s;uch Matters; I mean <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>. Only declaring that I allow him, as well as all party Men in the World, to be of the be&s;t Authority again&s;t them&s;elves, and their own party of any others. (5) As to the Councils I &s;hall except again&s;t none, that are not quite too late to be of much Value in &s;uch Matters. Accordingly I &s;hall allow the Con&s;ideration of all the Councils, that wereheld either before, or within 36 Years after the Council of <HI>Nice: i. e.</HI> all in which the Original <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y could be concern'd. And I de&s;ire it may be ob&s;erv'd, that there were then A&s;&s;embled &s;everal Councils, which might ju&s;tly be accounted <HI>Great Councils</HI>, and many that might ju&s;tly be called <HI>General</HI>, how little account &s;oever the Moderns make of them; and that I &s;hall not Imitate the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Pa|pists</HI> in this Ca&s;e, who call only tho&s;e <HI>General Councils</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="91">
which are for the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>, or Confirm'd by the <HI>Pope</HI>, but I &s;hall, without any &s;uch partiality, di&s;tin|gui&s;h the Councils held before A. D. 361 and which have any Records now extant, about the&s;e points, into three Ranks; the <HI>&s;mall Councils</HI> which had had much fewer than 100 Bi&s;hops: the <HI>great Coun|cils</HI> which had at the lea&s;t about an 100 Bi&s;hops: and the <HI>general Councils</HI> which had more than 150. and commonly no fewer than 200 or 300 or even 400 Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent. Accordingly of the 21 Councils before A. D. 361 I reckon 11 &s;mall Councils, 3 great Councils, and 7 general Councils, which I &s;hall Ap|peal to in my future Defence. And indeed Tis a great &s;hame, that the World &s;hould be &s;o mi&s;erably Impos'd upon, in this point, by the contrary pro|cedure. To call one Council a <HI>General Council</HI> which had but 150 Bi&s;hops there, as the Ca&s;e was of the &s;econd general Council, becau&s;e it made for the Party that afterward prevail'd; while others of 200. 300. or even 400 Bi&s;hops are look'd on as <HI>Conciliabula, &s;mall and Trifling A&s;&s;emblies</HI>; and this meerly becau&s;e they made again&s;t them; this is no better than a gro&s;s Cheat upon Mankind. The Councils I mean are the <HI>&s;mall</HI> ones, that of <HI>Rome</HI>, that of <HI>Milan</HI>, 4 of <HI>Sirmium</HI>, that of <HI>Arles</HI>, that of <HI>Beziers</HI> that of <HI>Ancyra</HI>, that of <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Thrace</HI>, and that of <HI>Constantinople</HI>, all in the 4th Century: The &s;everal <HI>great Councils</HI> I mean are three at <HI>Antioch</HI> in the &s;ame Century; and the <HI>general Councils</HI>, that of <HI>Antioch</HI> in the third, that of <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Bithynia</HI>, that of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>, that of <HI>Sardica</HI>, that of <HI>Milan</HI>, that of <HI>Selcucia</HI>, and that of <HI>Ariminum</HI>, in the fourth Century. (6) That I &s;hall not concern my &s;elf with any later Councils, tho' they be called General, and tho' our Church after a &s;ort admits them, even in the ca&s;e of Here&s;y; not only becau&s;e they were Comparatively &s;o late, but for other par|ticular Rea&s;ons al&s;o. The third or that of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>, the fourth or that of <HI>Chalcedon</HI>, were concern'd
<PB N="90" REF="92">
with quite different Points: and the&s;e Articles them&s;elves do not pretend that my Doctrine is con|trary to either of tho&s;e Councils. And for the &s;econd, or that of <HI>Constantinople</HI>, I meddle not with it in this Ca&s;e, tho' my Doctrine be charg'd as contrary to its Decrees; not only on account of its being &s;o &s;mall, as well as &s;o late, but becau&s;e its Re|cords of this nature have nothing again&s;t me in par|ticular: the only Record which may &s;eem to affect me, I mean the Synodical Epi&s;tle, being mo&s;t evident+ly not written by the general Council it &s;elf, but by a &s;maller number of Bi&s;hops, met in the &s;ame place about a Year afterwards; as I &s;hall Demon&s;trate, if the Court will admit of it, by producing the Epi&s;tle it &s;elf from <HI>Theodorit</HI>. (7) We mu&s;t in all ancient Te&s;timonies, accurately di&s;tingui&s;h between Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophy, and Chri&s;tian Faith; or between the private Opinions of &s;ome Philo&s;ophical Men in the Church, and what Doctrines they all along deliver'd down as coming from Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles. (8) We mu&s;t never look on any Opi|nions which can be trac'd no higher than the Phi|lo&s;ophical Wri$ers of the Church, to be &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted to, as &s;acred Doctrines of the Go&s;pel. (9) Nor mu&s;t we ground otherwi&s;e uncertain Doctrines on &s;uch Interpretations of texts of Scripture, as came in in the latter Times of the Church. (10) We mu&s;t never Interpret away the Natural and obvious &s;en&s;e of any Text of Scripture, or ancient Te&s;timonies, by introducing Di&s;tinctions, and Eva&s;ions, which were never heard of till the later Ages, and that perhaps meerly to get clear of tho&s;e Texts and Te&s;ti|imonies them&s;elves. (11) We mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the Septuagint Tran&s;lation, for the primitive Quotations made from the old Te&s;tament, and not to the Hebrew Text; becau&s;e that Tran&s;lation was the almo&s;t only Bible tho&s;e Chri&s;tians made u&s;e of, as is known to all the Learned (12) When Philo&s;ophi|cal
<PB N="91" REF="93">
Phra&s;es or Language are made u&s;e of by the An|cients, about their Notions in Chri&s;tianity, they mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the meaning of &s;uch Phra&s;es or Language then, and not according to their meaning in the later Ages of the Church. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations are generally &s;o agreeable to common &s;en&s;e and Rea&s;on, that it would be an affront upon the Judgment of this Court, to go about more La|boriou&s;ly to prove them. And what I &s;hall add here therefore is this; That As I &s;hall endeavour to ob|&s;erve the&s;e Rules exactly in my future Defence, &s;o &s;hall I intirely expect that they be equally ob&s;erved, by any that may either here, or el&s;ewhere, make any Reply thereto. Which expectation cannot but be allow'd by all Impartial Per&s;ons, to be highly ju&s;t and Rea&s;onable in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And now having premis'd what I thought proper, by way of Preliminaries I am ready to Proceed to my Defence. But &s;till before I come to the &s;everal Articles them&s;elves, directly mention'd in this Ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t me, I beg leave to clear my &s;elf of one general Charge, which lies at the bottom of this Pro&s;ecution, and which is perpetually in&s;inuated into the minds of hone&s;t and well meaning, but inju|dicious and weak People, to my great di&s;advantage, and to the great di&s;advantage of that &s;acred cau&s;e I am engag'd in; and that is the Imputation laid on me, and all &s;uch as ever attempt any Reformation in points of this Nature, that we all endeavour to be <HI>Wi&s;e above what is written</HI>; that we do not &s;ub|mit our Under&s;tandings <HI>to the Obedience of Faith</HI>; that we mea&s;ure all by the bare light of Rea&s;on; that we are not willing to believe any My&s;teries in Religion, b$t &s;et up Philo&s;ophy and Free Thinking, in Oppo&s;ition to Faith, and Divine Revelation That &s;ince the Trinity in Unity, or that the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t are three Per&s;ons and but one God, is the fir&s;t and Principal of the&s;e Divine My&s;teries,
<PB N="92" REF="94">
'tis the Object of Faith, but not of Rea&s;on; and ought to be Believ'd, but not Di&s;puted; and that therefore what Arguments &s;oever may be brought again&s;t it, 'tis Pre&s;umption and Profanene&s;s to examine into it: and that accordingly Chri&s;tians are not to hear me, or con&s;ider what I &s;ay, but to dete&s;t my Notions, if not to abhorr and per&s;ecute my Per&s;on al&s;o on their Account. This you cannot but know to be the grand popular Topick again&s;t me; and tho' neither the Convocation, nor this Court have pro|perly laid this to my Charge, yet have many of the Pulpits even in this City &s;ufficiently enforc'd it: as I my &s;elf, as well as many others, are Unque&s;tiona|ble Witne&s;&s;es. In way of Reply to which Accu&s;ati|on, I mean &s;o far as it concerns my &s;elf, I venture to affirm that it is utterly Groundle&s;s, and without the lea&s;t Foundation in any of my Writings or Con|duct. On the contrary I have ever intirely endeavour|ed, to re&s;ign my Under&s;tanding to the Obedience of Faith; I have made the Revealed Word of God the proper Standard of my Belief, in all &s;uch &s;acred Matters as the&s;e are: I have indeed made &s;ome En|quiries into natural Philo&s;ophy, into A&s;tronomy, and the Sy&s;tem of the World; and am very glad to find that the glorious Works of God and his Holy Word do &s;o well agree, and bear Witne&s;s to one ano|ther; and I do own that what I know of the former has given me great &s;atisfaction as to my belief of the latter. But then I never introduce Philo&s;ophy into the Doctrines or My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity. On the contrary, I think no one ever took greater care that no Philo&s;ophical or Schola&s;tick rea&s;oning whatever &s;hould in the lea&s;t &s;ully my Mind, or bya&s;s my Notions, when I was enquiring into the Do|ctrines of Chri&s;t. I con&s;ider tho&s;e Doctrines always as Hi&s;torical facts, no way to be di&s;covered but by ancient Te&s;timonies and Records; and accordingly I do no more pretend to tell by Rea&s;on and Philo&s;o|phy,
<PB N="93" REF="95">
what our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles at fir&s;t preach'd, than what Battles <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> fought, or what Laws the Romans made, about the &s;ame Cen|turies. I ever own and receive all tho&s;e Doctrines, and My&s;teries which I find our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord has revealed to us, either by his own preaching, or by the preaching and Writings of his Apo&s;tles, and their fir&s;t Companions, as Doctrines and My&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity. And if I do not own and receive the common Doctrine or My&s;tery of the Trinity, <HI>as it has been of late under&s;tood</HI> it is not properly becau&s;e it is above my Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e I certain|ly find that it never was matter of Divine Revelation; not &s;trictly becau&s;e it is not fully to be comprehend|ed, but becau&s;e it is un&s;upported by the Bible; not becau&s;e it is a My&s;tery, and reveal'd as &s;uch; but becau&s;e I di&s;cover no &s;uch Doctrine, no &s;uch My&s;tery to have been revealed at all among the genuine Re|cords of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; becau&s;e I find that, tho' there be &s;uch a My&s;tery now in the Church, 'tis like the My&s;tery of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, a New, a Humane, a Philo&s;ophical, or rather an Heretical My&s;tery, ut|terly unknown to the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity; and one main branch of the later Antichri&s;tian Corrupti|on, introduced by Philo&s;ophy and Tyranny in later Ages, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;hew at large here|after. And, as I am not a&s;hamed to profe&s;s that I do believe &s;everal <HI>My&s;teries</HI> in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> things which I am not able fully to comprehend, or give a compleat account of, both in Philo&s;ophy and Divi|nity; becau&s;e I have &s;ufficient evidence of their truth and reality, either from Experiment or Divine Te&s;timony; &s;o do I as freely profe&s;s that I cannot di&s;cover this <HI>My&s;tery of the Trinity</HI>, either Name or Thing, in the Sacred Catholick Writers of more than three Centuries; but do account it to be truly an <HI>A|thana&s;ian My&s;tery</HI> and no more; and that it properly &s;tands upon the Authority of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> and that of

his Followers, in the more ignorant Ages of the Church. Nor will their Authority at all move me, till I &s;ee it &s;upported by &s;ome other and better Evi|dence than has yet appeared. And as to the Im|putation of <HI>Free-Thinking</HI>, in the ill &s;en&s;e of that Word, now &s;o current among us, I hope, tho&s;e that have &s;eriou&s;ly perus'd my <HI>Reflections</HI> on that irreligious Pamphlet, which is called <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e of Free-Thinking</HI>, and has made &s;uch a noi&s;e of late, which I here deliver into the Court, to &s;ay nothing of many of my other Writings relating to the &s;ame Subject, will be a&s;hamed hereafter to lay again&s;t me &s;uch an odious and groundle&s;s imputati|on. But to leave this preliminary Vindication, and to come directly to the pre&s;ent Accu&s;ation of He|re&s;y; I &s;hall now proceed to Vindicate my &s;elf all along in a regular cour&s;e, Article by Article, as Dr. <HI>Pelling</HI> has charged them upon me, and this Court has admitted of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the&s;e Articles, and by way of a general charge, I am accus'd for <Q>&startq;Declaring that the <HI>Arian</HI> Doctrine concerning the Trinity and Incar|nation, is the Doctrine of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, his Apo&s;tles, and the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians; and do very Scandalou&s;ly in&s;inuate that all who have con&s;idered the&s;e Matters, want nothing but the Hone&s;ty and the Courage, to own them&s;elves of the &s;ame &endq;Opini|on.</Q> Now in An&s;wer to the latter part of this Ac|cu&s;ation, I de&s;ire to have &s;ome place in my Books particularly &s;pecifyed where I make &s;uch a Scanda|lous In&s;inuation, as is here affirm'd of me. I do not deny that I have &s;everal times In&s;inuated, That if all the really Learned and Judicious, would tell the World their Minds, or the re&s;ult of their Examina|tion as to the&s;e Matters, with the &s;ame openne&s;s and &s;incerity that I have done, it would mo&s;t plainly appear that the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine, is not &s;o Univer&s;ally believ'd as it is profe&s;s'd: which I know
<PB N="95" REF="97">
to be mo&s;t certainly true. But that ever I have in&s;inuated what is here charg'd upon me, I utterly deny; nay indeed I am not a little confident that if I had done it, the particular place of my Papers, would have been cited to ju&s;tify this part of the Charge, as there is in the other Parts; which yet is not done. But then, as to the former part of this Charge, that concerning <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, I own it is in effect my own Words: But then I mu&s;t &s;till grievous|ly complain of the partiality and unfairne&s;s of this Accu&s;ation notwith&s;tanding. For as the Words lie here, every body by the <HI>Arian Doctrine</HI> will readily under&s;tand the real Doctrine and Language of <HI>Ari|us, the Arian Here&s;y</HI> it &s;elf, as it was Condemned at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>; and will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e that I have affirm'd that that Doctrine of <HI>Arius</HI>, that <HI>Ari|an Here&s;y</HI> it &s;elf was the Doctrine of our Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|vior, his Apo&s;tles, and of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians: whereas I never did nor do affirm any &s;uch thing; never did nor do approve of tho&s;e Doctrines or Language. <Q>And for the truth of this An&s;wer, I &s;hall fir&s;t refer this Court to the very &s;ame Paper whence my words here are drawn; I mean my Hi&s;torical Preface, in which, at the very &s;econd page, I had di&s;tinctly explain'd my &s;elf as to what I always meant by the <HI>Arians</HI>, and by the <HI>Arian Doctrine; viz.</HI> &startq;that by the <HI>Arians</HI>, I meant &s;till that part of the Church which was called <HI>Arian</HI> in the fourth Century, and not <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf only, with a few of his particular followers: and by the <HI>Arian Doctrine</HI>, the Doctrine of that part of the Church, &endq;and no other.</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> I u&s;ed the very common but very improper name of <HI>Arians</HI>, in&s;tead of the much more proper, but very uncommon name of <HI>Eu&s;ebi|ans</HI>; as I have mo&s;t fully &s;ince explain'd my &s;elf upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions. And that this Court may be in|tirely &s;atisfyed in the &s;incerity of my Procedure, as to this point, all along, I farther Appeal to the &s;eve|ral

Articles of the Primitive Faith, which I have publi&s;hed, as all the <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> that I embrace; and in&s;i&s;t that every one of tho&s;e Articles are the <HI>Eu&s;ebi|an</HI> Doctrine, but not one of them the peculiar Doctrine or Language of <HI>Arius</HI> and his followers; not one of them parts of that <HI>Arian Here&s;y</HI> it &s;elf, which was condemned by the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>: as I &s;hall all the way &s;hew in my future Defence. Nay, I further appeal to the very fir&s;t Reply to Dr. <HI>Alix</HI>, whence part of the&s;e Articles are al&s;o taken, where|in I expre&s;ly an&s;wer a like Imputation then laid upon me by Dr. <HI>Alix:</HI><NOTE PLACE="inter"><HI>p.</HI> 10.11.</NOTE> I ap|peal particularly al&s;o, as I do there, to that Letter which I had a little before written to the Convocation, by his Grace the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, in&s;erted in the Appendix, and in great part upon this very Subject; which Letter therefore I beg leave to read intirely before the Court, in order to my compleat Vindication upon this Head.</P>

<P>SINCE I perceive that my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> has given Offence, not only to &s;everal Good Men in particular, but to the Body of the Con|vocation in general' and to many others who are really de&s;irous that Truth and Primitive Chri&s;tiani|ty may prevail; and that not only on Account of the <HI>Manner</HI> of my Writing, which &s;eems to be with

too great Confidence and A&s;&s;urance; but al&s;o be|cau&s;e it looks like reviving the very <HI>Here&s;y of Arius</HI> him&s;elf, as it was condemned by the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>: The great Regard I have to the Peace of the Church, and my &s;incere De&s;ire to approve my &s;elf to my Superiors in it, have made me think it might be very proper to Addre&s;s my &s;elf to your Grace, as Pre&s;ident of the Convocation, upon this Occa&s;i|on; to lay before you my &s;incere Thoughts, as to the&s;e Matters, with the utmo&s;t Humility and Defe|rence, that I may not be e&s;teem'd &s;o perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate, as not to own any Indecencies I may have been guilty of; and that I may not be charg'd with what never was in my Thoughts or De&s;igns, with Regard to the Revival of the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y: And at the &s;ame time to beg of your Grace to u&s;e your Endeavour that the Things I propo&s;e may not any way &s;uffer on account of any Ra&s;hne&s;s in the way of my propo&s;ing them. For as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of my Writing upon the&s;e Subjects, it is, I confe&s;s, too a|greeable to the Warmth and Vehemence of my na|tural Temper, increas'd by an hearty, and I am &s;ure an hone&s;t Zeal for what things &s;oever at any time appear to me to be true, and of Importance in Chri|&s;tianity. I hope God, who knows the in mo&s;t Rece&s;|&s;es of my Soul, will not impute all that appears to be ra&s;h and a&s;&s;uming, to &s;uch a proud and conceited Temper as it may &s;eem to others to proceed from: And that he will mercifully forgive any Offences of that Nature, where he finds the Heart in the main &s;incere and upright; and hone&s;tly labouring, to the be&s;t of its Knowledge, to promote Truth and Piety in the world. And as I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that the uncorrupt Faith and Practice of the Go&s;pel in e|very Part may prevail among us, &s;o do I heartily de|&s;ire that I may not be found Guilty of breaking any of the Rules of Chri&s;tian Meekne&s;s, Humility, Mo|de&s;ty, and Deference to lawful Authority, while I
<PB N="98" REF="100">
am aiming to promote, to the be&s;t of my Judgmen and Ability, the Purity of Chri&s;ts Religion among Men. And I mu&s;t own to your Grace that I am, upon Reflection, &s;en&s;ible that in &s;everal Expre&s;&s;i|ons, and in many Circum&s;tances of my Management, I have not always kept within tho&s;e &s;trict Rules of the Go&s;pel, which the Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t and his Religion requires in &s;uch Ca&s;es? and that therefore I may &s;ometimes have given Occa&s;i|on of Offence to my Chri&s;tian Brethren, and to tho&s;e in Authority in particular: For which Faults, where|ever they have appear'd, either by Word or Wri|tings, as I do heartily beg Forgivene&s;s of God and of good Men, &s;o do I faithfully promi&s;e that I will be more careful not to be Guilty of the &s;ame hereafter. Humbly de&s;iring that my &s;peaking plainly what I judge to be Truth, may not be e&s;teem'd ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence; that I be allow'd with a decent Freedom to produce all the proper Arguments and Te&s;timo|nies for what I propo&s;e; and that I be permitted mode&s;tly to declare what Degree of Evidence I think I have for what I a&s;&s;ert. As to the Imputation of <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, which I confe&s;s I have not been &s;ufficient|ly careful to avoid, I do declare it never was my In|tention to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Arian Here&s;y</HI>, &s;trictly &s;o called; or to revive the <HI>Here&s;y</HI> of <HI>Arius</HI>, and of his peculiar Followers, as it was condemn'd at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. I guarded again&s;t this expre&s;sly in my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>, p. 2. by a particular Declaration, that by that <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> which I &s;peak of, I ever mean the Doctrine of that Part of the Church which was call'd <HI>Arian</HI> in the Fourth Century; and not the Doctrine of <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf only, with a few of his particular Followers. And this Di&s;tinction is &s;o plain in all my Papers, that whereas I every where own the Doctrine of that Part of the Church in the Fourth Century, which their Adver&s;aries would call by the odious Name of <HI>Arian</HI>, yet do not I in any
<PB N="99" REF="101">
Propo&s;ition a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e Particular Novel Doctrines, or u&s;e the like Particular Novel Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf, which were condemned at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>; but ever confine my &s;elf to the much Ancien|ter and more Authentick Doctrines and Language of the Scripture and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers. And I take leave to ob&s;erve here a few Things far|ther; That the main Body of tho&s;e whom their Ad|ver&s;aries call'd <HI>Arians</HI> in the Fourth Century, were them&s;elves &s;o far from ju&s;tifying any of tho&s;e Ra&s;h and Novel A&s;&s;ertions and Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Arius</HI>, which caus'd the Di&s;turbances in the Church at that time, and were condemn'd at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, that they did not approve of them, or in&s;ert them into their Creeds; nay, did not them&s;elves publick|ly admit <HI>Arius</HI> and his Followers into the Church a|gain, till he gave in a Creed without the lea&s;t Syl|lable of them; as is evident in the Hi&s;tory of that Age. In reality, I think no one ought to be at all led by any particular Men, but to take their Chri|&s;tian Faith and Practice from tho&s;e mo&s;t Sacred and Primitive Writers, which liv'd long before the Ri&s;e of the Controver&s;ies in the Fourth Century; as I have endeavour$d to do in my <HI>Account of the Primi|tive Faith</HI> of Chri&s;tians. I take this Opportunity al&s;o to beg of your Grace, if you &s;hall think fit, to recom|mend the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of my Papers to the Convocation, or to a committee of Learned Men this Summer; that &s;o all may proceed with that Fairne&s;s, and &s;incere Regard to Truth and Chri&s;tianity, which becomes the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. If once this Matter be brought to that Method of Proceeding, I &s;hall exceedingly rejoyce, and be ready, whenever I &s;hall be requir'd, to lay all my Papers before them for their Con&s;ideration, and to correct any Mi&s;takes in them, or retract any Opinions I have advanc'd, that upon due Examination &s;hall appear not to be

<P>It is therefore, I think, mo&s;t evident, that this preliminary Accu&s;ation, as if I were for the real <HI>Arian Here&s;y</HI>, and &s;o were propagating <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> it &s;elf in the World, is utterly fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. Nay, indeed, My Lords, I think I have great rea&s;on to complain of very hard Mea&s;ure in the very admi&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch an Accu&s;ation by this Court, as if I were really an <HI>Arian</HI>, and were to be tryed as &s;uch. Such reproaches as the&s;e in common Di&s;cour&s;e, in private Letters, or in the heat of Di&s;pute, tho' not well grounded, may be born with; but &s;ure 'tis utterly beneath the dignity of a Court of Ju&s;tice, of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court of Ju&s;tice, of a Supreme Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court of Ju&s;tice acting without Appeal, to lend any ear to an Imputation &s;o utterly fal&s;e, to an Accu&s;ation &s;o wholly unju&s;t as this is; while in&s;tead of the real and proper Doctrines of <HI>Arius</HI>, the pro|per <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y in general, not One &s;ingle branch of the <HI>Arian</HI> Doctrines, not one direct part of the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y is &s;o much as charged upon me in any of the&s;e Articles. So far from it, that the&s;e Arti|cles were almo&s;t every one the plain Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Church till after the days of <HI>Arius</HI>, of the <HI>Eu&s;ebians</HI> in particular, who never followed <HI>Arius</HI>; nay, of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it&s;elf, and o|ther Councils of the Church, at the very &s;ame time that they Condemned <HI>Arius</HI>, and Anathematiz'd the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y; as I have already demon&s;trated to all the World, and &s;hall more fully demon&s;trate in the cour&s;e of this my Vindication before you.
<PB N="101" REF="103">
No, I am no <HI>Arian</HI>, but a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>: I aim to fol|low not <HI>Arius</HI>, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us with his Apo&s;tles, and them alone in all the revealed Chri&s;tian Doctrines I believe, and in all the revealed Chri&s;tian Laws I o|bey, &s;o far as I am able to under&s;tand them. And after I have made this Declaration, give me leave to make another of the like nature; that I am no <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> neither, but a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and that I aim to follow not <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us with his Apo&s;tles, and them alone, in all the&s;e matters. Nay, I &s;hall take leave to declare further, that I am no <HI>Nicean, Con&s;tantinopolitan, Ephe&s;ian</HI>, nor <HI>Chalcedonian</HI> neither, but a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>; and that I cannot be tru|ly brought under any &s;uch denomination what&s;oe|ver. I mean, that I follow even the four General Councils them&s;elves, the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI>, of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>, or of <HI>Chalcedon</HI>; or indeed any other Synods, or later Authorities what&s;oever no farther than upon the be&s;t enquiries I perceive they were them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, or the followers of Chri&s;t, of his Apo&s;tles, and of them only, in &s;uch great Points of Di|vine Revelation&punc; For tho' I pay a great re&s;pect to the mo&s;t primitive Records of Chri&s;tian Antiquity, and to the Decrees of the earlie&s;t Councils of the Church; yet is all this as they are great means and helps in order to the di&s;covering and tracing down the origi|nal Doctrines and Laws of Chri&s;t, and not as; they are them&s;elves original Standards. Accordingly, while they confirm or do not oppo&s;e the Doctrines and Laws of the Go&s;pel, I am mo&s;t willing to acquie&s;ce in their Notions, and value their Determinations; but when I once plainly find they leave them, and &s;et up oppo&s;ite Notions or Decrees of their own, I have no value for them any longer: as having learn'd from St. <HI>Paul, Gal.</HI> i. 8, 9. that if an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>, or <HI>an Angel from Heaven &s;hould preach otherwi&s;e than Chri&s;t at fir&s;t delivered to his Church, he is to be</HI> &s;o far from being Receiv'd, that he is to be <HI>Accur&s;ed</HI>.</P>

<P><PB N="103" REF="105">Now after what manner I am to An&s;wer this as an <HI>Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y</HI> before a Chri&s;tian Court, (for &s;uch a Court I hope you &s;till own your &s;elves to be,) I am greatly to &s;eek. For were it not im|po&s;&s;ible to disbelieve the evidence of Sen&s;e, and to doubt of what I &s;ee with my own Eyes, I &s;hould be here under the &s;tronge&s;t temptation of disbelieving that this is any part of my Accu&s;ation. And the Rea&s;on is plain, that if there be any one Propo&s;ition certain in Natural Religion, in the Patriarchal Re|ligion, in the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Religions, it is this; that there is but <HI>One only God, One &s;upreme Origin and Governour of all things</HI>: and if there be any one other Propo&s;ition certain in the Chri&s;tian Religion, it is this, which is here it &s;eems e&s;te$m'd Heretical; I mean, that this <HI>One only God, One only Supreme Origin and Governor of all things, is no other than the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>. This I own as the primary foundation of our Religion, and a&s;|&s;ert that it was always of old allowed as the grand Article which the Catechumens were ever fir&s;t taught from the Rule of Faith; which the Scriptures every where declare; which the mo&s;t primitive Catholick Writers perpetually inculcate; and all the fir&s;t Councils of the Church, without exception, do una|nimou&s;ly agree to; and which our Church in her <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, and in her Collect for the 18th Sun|day after Trinity, does &s;till acknowledge at this Day. So that to lay this as a Charge again&s;t me for Here&s;y is not at all better than if that Charge had been for a&s;&s;erting the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, or any other of the mo&s;t fundamental in the whole Chri&s;tian Religion. Nay, indeed I do not know that there are &s;o many, and &s;o expre&s;s Texts and Te&s;timonies for this latter as for that former Article of our Religion. And I take leave
<PB N="104" REF="106">
to &s;ay, that when once this or any Church does open|ly condemn this Doctrine as Heretical, they thereby become &s;o far Heretical them&s;elves; and do thereby &s;o far them&s;elves forfeit all ju&s;t pretences, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, to Chri&s;tianity. I &s;hall therefore take leave to be very full and particular in my proofs for the truth of this Article; not only in order to my intire Vindication; but in order to do my utmo&s;t to re|cover this fundamental Doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Religion among us; which is I perceive in great danger of being lo&s;t by the Modern Churches, and even by our own Church it&s;elf. And here I &s;hall be mindful of the Promi&s;e I formerly made in my Reply to Dr <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Accu&s;ations of Bla&s;phemy, Irreligion, and Here&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Hi&s;t.

Chri&s;tians.

And I de&s;ire that one Circum&s;tance may here be particularly noted, which is exceeding remarkable, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves, even till towards the end of the fourth Century, and this after they had come into many new Notions, not very con&s;i&s;tent with that before us, had not yet boldne&s;s enough to alter the Primitive Form in this Article; but did &s;till freely allow that the Fa|ther alone was the <HI>One God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and that in real di&s;tinction from the Son al&s;o; while it was re&s;erved to later and wor&s;er Ages to make &s;o bold an alteration in the Rule of Faith it&s;elf, as has been &s;ince done in the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Aquileian</HI> Creeds, which made way for that now called the <HI>Apo&s;tles Creed</HI>, which omits the Word <HI>One</HI> in the fir&s;t Arti|cle, and profe&s;&s;es only to Believe <HI>in God the Father, Almighty</HI>; in&s;tead of believing <HI>in One God, the Father Almighty</HI>, contrary to all the ancienter Creeds now extant in the World; unle&s;s we except that of the known Heretick <HI>Marcellus</HI> in the &s;ame fourth Centu|ry: which is here omitted, as of no Authority at all. Nor can I but mention this gro&s;s omi&s;&s;ion in our or|dinary Creed; &s;ince it &s;eems to have been one great

occa&s;ion of impo&s;ing on the Body of Chri&s;tian People in this important Matter; while they ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that by Believing <HI>in God, the Father Almighty</HI>, they are only taught to believe, that the Father, in com|mon with the Son and Holy Gho&s;t, is the Almighty God; nay, while I fear they by Cu&s;tom come to u&s;e the very <HI>Nicene</HI> Form, <HI>I believe in One God the Father Almighty</HI>, in &s;ome &s;uch Sen&s;e al&s;o: As if there were indeed but One God the Father, but might be ano|ther God the Son, and another God the Holy Gho&s;t; as they are u&s;ually taught to expre&s;s them&s;elves from their Childhood. I do not &s;ay the Learned are to be thus impo&s;ed upon; but that the Vulgar and Unlearned frequently are I do verily believe. Nor is it impro|per therefore to note here on their account, that the words <HI>One God the Father Almighty</HI>, are not in the Creed to be joyn'd together, and taken as it they al|lowed any <HI>other God</HI> be&s;ides him who is the <HI>Father, and Almighty</HI>, but that they mean plainly that there is but One God; and that he is the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the &s;upreme Governor of all things: As al&s;o, that any &s;uch Phra&s;es as <HI>God the Son</HI>, or <HI>God the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>, are utterly &s;trangers to Scripture and Antiquity; and in particular have no manner of footing in the Original Rule of Faith, or in any of the ancient Creeds.

that <HI>God</HI>, by way of Eminence, and with the high|e&s;t Epithets, <HI>the One and Only God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, is no other than the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Doctrine, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, taken jointly, are that <HI>One and Only God</HI>. It will be now proper to &s;hew the &s;ame conclu&s;ion another way, I mean by proving that the <HI>Supreme Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip</HI> was all along, the fir&s;t Ages accordingly directed; not jointly to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as to the one Supreme God, but only to God the Father; and that through the Mediation of the Son; not as with him the One God, but as his Son and an Interce&s;&s;or with him: as the following numerous and plain Texts of Holy Scrip|ture, and Te&s;timonies of Antiquity will mo&s;t clearly Demon&s;trate. <HI>See</HI> Article II. p. 54&mdash;76.</P>
<P>And now, becau&s;e I am under this Article accus'd for altering the <HI>Doxology</HI>, from the u&s;ual form of giving Glory <HI>to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>, with the Father and Son; into this other Form of giving Glory <HI>to</HI> the Father, <HI>by</HI> the Son, or to the Father <HI>and</HI> the Son, but &s;till <HI>in</HI> the Holy Gho&s;t, or by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance only; I &s;hall here Vindicate my &s;elf from this imputation of Here&s;y; and that by producing the &s;acred and Primitive Dox|ologies them&s;elves, even as low as the Days of <HI>Atha|na&s;ius</HI>, for my Vindication; and by demon&s;trating thereby the uncertainty and probable novelty of the common, and the undoubted Antiquity and Authority of that ancient Form; the Re&s;toration of which I &s;o earne&s;tly plead for.

own'd, mo&s;t Certainly &s;acred and unque&s;tionable, to lay a blot upon the &s;ame form, as obliquely <HI>Arian</HI> and Heretical: which we &s;hall &s;ee anon was the very ca&s;e of the Orthodox, as they affected to call them&s;elves, even in the fourth and fifth Centuries of the Church; and which appears by the Accu&s;ation to be the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>, or Orthodox at this day among us. So fatal and pernicious a thing it is once to for&s;ake the &s;ure guidance of Scripture and Anti|quity, and to give up our &s;elves to the uncertain con|duct of human inventions, and uncertain rea&s;onings in divine matters! I proceed to my Te&s;timonies. [See Vol. IV. Appendix.] And now, before I come to An&s;wer Objections, give me leave to In|form this Court, of what once pa&s;s'd between one of of the greate&s;t, mo&s;t Learned, and judicious Per&s;ons now in this Church, and my &s;elf, upon this very Head; becau&s;e it de&s;erves the mo&s;t careful con&s;ideration. <Q>This Per&s;on then, whom I have not permi&s;&s;ion to name, having perused my fourth Volume in M S. confe&s;&s;ed to me, that I had indeed proved therein, that if we judge by all the pre&s;ent remains of Antiquity, the Holy Spirit was not called <HI>God</HI> by the ancient Chri&s;tians, and that he was not <HI>Invocated</HI> by them: and particu|larly &startq;that it appear'd by my Te&s;timonies, and <HI>Ba&s;il</HI>'s own large account, that the form of the Primitive, and mo&s;t undoubted Doxology was that I am here ac|cus'd of Here&s;y for; viz. <HI>In the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>: But that &s;till he thought, <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> had given good Rea&s;ons why we might venture farther in tho&s;e matters, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as if not to call the Holy Spirit <HI>God</HI>, and to <HI>In|vocate</HI> him, Yet to give Glory <HI>To</HI> him directly in tho&s;e <HI>Doxologies</HI>. To whom I remember, I made this An&s;wer: Had &s;ome other of even the mo&s;t Learned Men of the Orthodox affirm'd this, I could have &s;uppo&s;ed that they believ'd them&s;elves; becau&s;e I take them to have much le&s;s judgment than Lear|ning: but God has given you, Sir, too great abi|lities

to believe that any Party of Men can alter the real Laws and Practices deriv'd from Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, in &s;uch &s;acred matters of Divine Wor|&s;hip, and then give good rea&s;ons why they altered &endq;them.</Q> To which that Per&s;on did not, that I re|member, make me any farther Reply: which yet I profe&s;s I greatly want, before I dare venture to fol|low any &s;uch dangerous <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Innovations in the&s;e &s;acred Matters of Religion. I now proceed to An&s;wer an Objection or two again&s;t what I have here &s;aid.</P>
<P>An Objection or two only, I &s;ay: For this Do|ctrine is &s;o plain in it &s;elf, and &s;o fully atte&s;ted to by all the old Chri&s;tian Records, that there is hardly room for any Objection again&s;t it at all. However, becau&s;e the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> do alledge two things that &s;eem at fir&s;t to contradict this Doctrine, that God by way of eminence, and with the highe&s;t Epithets, the One and Only God of the Chri&s;tian Religion, is no o|ther than the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I &s;hall here plainly produce tho&s;e Objections, and then as plainly produce my An&s;wer to them.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Then it is &s;aid, that if the Father be the One and Only God of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and that in real di&s;tinction from the Son, this will take away that other Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which I my &s;elf el&s;ewhere allow, concerning the Divinity of our Saviour. For if the Son be God, as well as the Father, and be real|ly di&s;tinct from the Father, then is not the Father the One and Only God. Now this common Objection, which we fir&s;t meet with from the old Hereticks, &s;hall be an&s;wered not by my &s;elf, but by &s;ome of the anci|ent Catholick Writers them&s;elves; whe tho' they mo&s;t plainly a&s;&s;erted the Divinity of the Son, did yet at the &s;ame time as plainly a&s;&s;ert, that the Father, in di&s;tinction from the Son, was the One and Only God of the Chri&s;tian Religion. And I beg that this Court will plea&s;e to attend to what the&s;e ancient Writers &s;ay upon this Head; that they may not be bya&s;&s;ed again&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="114">
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fundamental Doctrine of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion, from an Objection taken from &s;ome of the old Hereticks them&s;elves, and fully reply'd to by the ancient Catholicks in the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel. Hear therefore how the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, <HI>Ignatius</HI>, the Author of the Book concerning the Tri|nity a&s;crib'd to <HI>Novation</HI>, The fir&s;t Council of <HI>Antioch</HI>, and the great <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> him&s;elf, one that join'd in the Condemnation of the <HI>Arians</HI> at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, deilver them&s;elves upon this occa&s;ion. See <HI>Vol</HI> IV. <HI>p.</HI> 90 &mdash; 93. <HI>Collect. of Mounm p.</HI> 12 &mdash; 16 <HI>Vol</HI> IV. p. 223.&mdash;227.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It is &s;aid that the Son mu&s;t be one God with the Father, and &s;o the Father in real di&s;tinction from the Son, cannot be the One and Only God of the Chri&s;tian Religion, becau&s;e That Divine Per&s;on &s;o often &s;poken of and appearing under the Old Te&s;t|ament, as Jehovah, the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>, the one Lord and God of the World, and he who was alone to be Wor&s;hipped and adored under peril of Idolatry, is frequently in the New Te&s;tament &s;aid to be our Saviour Chri&s;t; and the incommunicable Name and Character of that &s;upreme God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and of the World, are there &s;poken of as belonging to the Son; who mu&s;t therefore be the very &s;ame Being, and the very &s;ame God with the Father; and by con&s;equence the Father, in real di&s;tinction from the Son, cannot be the One and only God of the Chri&s;tian Religion. This is, I think, the full force of this &s;econd Objection; and in|deed contains the main &s;trength of the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Cau&s;e in this whole Controver&s;y. Now to come to my Reply, I &s;ay plainly, that had we been left to our own Rea&s;oning here, and had no farther Light affor|ded us than what the&s;e modern Objectors u&s;ually own; Had not the ancient Records of our Religion, given us a di&s;tinct and plain account of this Difficulty, and that as the very account that Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles deliver'd them&s;elves, We might not perhaps have
<PB N="113" REF="115">
been able upon the compari&s;on, fully to reconcile the Te&s;timonies of the Old Te&s;tament and their Applica|tion in the New together. Tho' even in that ca&s;e it would have been very ra&s;h and unju&s;tifiable, to draw &s;uch wild con&s;equences from &s;uch a compari&s;on as the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> now do. But when this whole mat|ter is &s;o fully di&s;cour&s;ed on, and clear'd in the ancient Records of our Religion; and that with &s;o great una|nimity, that 'tis hard to produce one di&s;&s;enting Per&s;on among the Primitive Fathers; and when the foundati|on of this Reconciliation is &s;o directly trac'd into the New Te&s;tament, and the other Apo&s;tolical Writings them&s;elves, as deliver'd by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles to their fir&s;t Followers, for the real truth of the Ca&s;e, Tis &s;trange how tho&s;e Learned Chri&s;tians, who are conver&s;ant with the Books of the New Te&s;tament, and the other antient Monuments of Chri&s;tianity, &s;hould rea&s;on &s;o odly and ab&s;urdly in this point. The difficulty here not ari&s;ing from want of Light, or from want of Direction, but from Mens own ignorance, or ob&s;tinacy in not making u&s;e of them. And the rea&s;on of that ignorance or ob&s;tinacy is but two plain, <HI>viz.</HI> that the true original Account of this Matter, which has from the beginning been delivered down in the Church of Chri&s;t, and was indeed own'd by the very original <HI>A|thana&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves, would not &s;erve the purpo&s;e of the modern <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>; and was therefore to be con|ceal'd from the World, as much as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall therefore, as before, beg leave to An&s;wer this Objecti|on, not in my own Words, but in tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, as they &s;tand in my own fourth Volume; with Bi&s;hop <HI>Bulls</HI> remarkable conce&s;&s;ions than which clearer need not be de&s;ir'd upon this Occa&s;ion See <HI>Vol</HI> IV.

was <HI>created</HI> by the Father, does directly contradict this proper Eternity: It being as certain that Chil|dren, which are <HI>begotten</HI>, cannot be coeval with their Parents; as it is that Clocks or Watches, which are <HI>made</HI>, cannot be coeval with their Makers; except it be po&s;&s;ible to conceive an <HI>Eternal Creation</HI>, or <HI>a Crea|ture Co-eternal to its Creator</HI>. Which Notion, though wholly unknown among the old Chri&s;tians, yet from &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Books, do I &s;u&s;pect he may think not to be impo&s;&s;ible. As for my &s;elf, I own that, as far as I can ob&s;erve, both tho&s;e Words, <HI>Generation</HI> and <HI>Creation</HI> were ever u&s;ed originally in direct Oppo&s;ition to the notion of proper Eternity. (6) Both the Con&s;titutions and Canons of the Apo&s;t|les, give us an Account of one of the <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Con&s;tit. L.

Which makes it utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to come into any &s;uch notion. (7.) When in the latter part of the Second Century we find the fir&s;t Traces of &s;omewhat like this Eternity, 'tis plainly what I call a <HI>Metaphy&s;ick</HI>, and not <HI>real</HI> Eternity, which was aimed at; 'tis &s;uppos'd <HI>prior</HI> to Chri&s;t's real Genera|tion and Creation, and not <HI>po&s;terior</HI> thereto; and this evidently appears to have been the Philo&s;ophick No|tion at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf; all which I have fully &s;hewn <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Account of the Primitive Faith. <HI>Artic.

fir&s;t u&s;es that Language, is expre&s;s, that <HI>Time</HI> began with the World; and is by all own'd to be again&s;t a|ny &s;uch Notion of Coeternity. Thus al&s;o <HI>Novatian</HI> who u&s;es it, is expre&s;s, <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">De Trinit. c. <HI>31.</HI> p. <HI>763.</HI></NOTE> that the Father was <HI>before</HI> the Son; and this as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from his being his Father: Which was al&s;o the almo&s;t univer|&s;al Doctrine of the Ea&s;t <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">See Account of the Primitive Faith <HI>p-</HI> 156.</NOTE> at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. Nor do I perceive &s;uch Authors as the&s;e to have had any notion of a real Co-eternity of our Saviour, <HI>prior</HI> to the Creation, by any of their Expre&s;&s;ions of this nature; but a metaphy&s;ical notion rather about that Duration, which was before all Creatures, and before all Time; as if it were not to be reckon'd, or were quite incomprehen&s;ible by us; contrary to our mo|dern Philo&s;ophy in that matter: Which thing &s;up|po&s;ed, all their Expre&s;&s;ions are very accountable; and, I think, are &s;o upon no other Hypothe&s;is what&s;oever. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> indeed u&s;es &s;uch Words without any expre&s;s Evidence that he di&s;own'd the real Eternity; tho', as he never directly a&s;&s;erts it in other Words, &s;o does he rather intimate, <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">L. II. c. <HI>48.</HI> p. <HI>176.</HI> &amp; L. III. c. <HI>20.</HI> p. <HI>245.</HI></NOTE> that it was a Metaphy&s;ick Eter|nity before his Generation, which he meant; and of which indeed he was very fond. This, I own he ex|pre&s;s'd the mo&s;t like to one that &s;uppos'd &s;omewhat of a real Eternity of any of the Antients; e&s;pecially this is the more remarkable in him on account of his plain avoiding of part of the old Language, that God <HI>created</HI> our Saviour; and &s;ub&s;tituting other Metaphy|&s;ical Words in its &s;tead. So that this Notion, of a &s;ort of <HI>real Eternity</HI> of our Saviour, almo&s;t wholly &s;tands, at lea&s;t for Two Centuries, upon a few Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Irenaeus</HI>.</P>
<P>Now I cannot per&s;wade my &s;elf to go into it upon
<PB N="118" REF="120">
&s;uch Authority; becau&s;e no Apo&s;tle, nor any one that knew an Apo&s;tle ever &s;aid &s;o; no Ea&s;tern Wri|ter then ever &s;aid &s;o; no Unphilo&s;ophical Writer e|ver &s;aid &s;o; neither him&s;elf nor any body el&s;e &s;ay &s;o in their Creeds, or Accounts of Doctrines deriv'd from the Apo&s;tles; He that &s;aid &s;o was a very weak Rea&s;oner, and ventured to argue ra&s;hly enough with the Hereticks, in&s;tead of the better original way of confuting them rather by Tradition and Scripture. He liv'd in the We&s;t, where Antichri&s;tiani&s;m fir&s;t be|gan; and he brought in heretical Language into the Church in this matter, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently; nay he went in with the corrupt Roman Practice about <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>, even again&s;t his own Ma&s;ter <HI>Polycarp</HI>, and the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, as is well known. So that I cannot &s;et up a few un&s;upported Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Irenaeus</HI> alone, were they never &s;o plain, as they are not, a|gain&s;t all the other full Evidence of the Chri&s;tian Do|ctrine in this matter.

<PB N="136" REF="138">
that He by running down that Doctrine and Language, ventur'd to oppo&s;e the Dictates of the Holy Spirit of God. For as to that Eva&s;ion which He is ever driven to, that this Text belongs not to the original <HI>Creation</HI> of our Lord before the World, but to his <HI>Incarnation</HI> afterward, 'tis &s;o gro&s;s, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous, that I can hardly believe any Man of Common Sen&s;e, much le&s;s a Man of the Parts of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> could believe him&s;elf in &s;uch an Expo&s;ition. And I beg of tho&s;e that are Admirers of his Rea&s;oning, to let me &s;ee one Chri|&s;tian now in the World &s;o very weak, as in earne&s;t to go into that Interpretation. We mu&s;t al&s;o note, that the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages &s;till extant for the real <HI>Creation</HI> of our Saviour; con&s;idering the &s;ad Lo&s;&s;es and Inter|polations of tho&s;e old Books that were again&s;t the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>, are very many and very plain; e&s;pe|cially if we review upon this occa&s;ion all the nume|rous Pa&s;&s;ages before refer'd to, when the Word <HI>Ge|neration</HI> is us'd, that it was ever own'd to be <HI>volun|tary, after</HI> the Will and Power, and good Plea&s;ure of the Father were pre-&s;uppos'd, and not from all Eternity; and remember that even the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, who dur&s;t &s;ay <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Athana&s;ius convicted of Forgery.</NOTE> Chri&s;t was <HI>not Made</HI> yet, dur&s;t not &s;ay he was <HI>not Created</HI>; and that <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>, who &s;eems to be unwilling after that Council to u&s;e that Word him&s;elf, did yet u&s;e it <HI>before</HI>; and did certainly not <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Monfaucon praelim, ad Eu&s;eb.

And we mu&s;t al&s;o note here, that the be&s;t of the antient Writers do not, as Dr. <HI>Clarke p.</HI> 182. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in&s;inuates, avoid &s;aying, that Chri&s;t was <HI>Created</HI> in general; but do &s;o only in the &s;ame Sentence that they &s;peak of the ordinary <HI>Creatures</HI> under that Denomination; as it was pro|per to do, on account of the va&s;t difference there was every way between them; and as the Arians and Eunomians did in another way, with the grea|te&s;t Exactne&s;s; I mean when they &s;aid he was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>A Creature, but not like one of the</HI> ordinary <HI>Creatures: A Being Made, but not like one of the</HI> ordinary <HI>Be|ings that were Made</HI>. This &s;eems the true occa&s;ion of that &s;cruple that has ari&s;en, whether our Saviour might be truly &s;aid to be <HI>Created</HI> or <HI>a Creature</HI>. The way to cure which is not to lay a&s;ide the old Words and invent new ones of our own; but to u&s;e and confine our &s;elves to tho&s;e old Words; yet withal to take care to u&s;e them in the &s;ame di&s;tnict man|ner, as they were originally under&s;tood by the an|tient Chri&s;tians, and not otherwi&s;e. But then, that he is really a <HI>Derivative, Begotten, Created</HI> Being, in oppo&s;ition to any proper <HI>Coeternity</HI> with the Fa|ther, I take to be very plain in Scripture and An|tiquity,

and an eminent part of that &s;acred <HI>Depo&s;itum</HI> which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles deliver'd to the Church; and which, for the main, was &s;till the Chri&s;tian Do|ctrine, e&s;pecially in all the Ea&s;tern <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See Account of the Primitive Faith Article VI.</NOTE> Parts, till many Years after the Council of <HI>Nice:</HI> nay indeed was &s;o known and confe&s;s'd a part of it, that Our Lord's <HI>Creation</HI> by the Father, was acknowledg'd in the publick Liturgy of the Jewi&s;h Churches; and what was equivalent thereto in that of the Gentiles, during all the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel, every Lord's Day, in the Offices for the Lord's Supper; as we learn from the plain Words of the Liturgies of the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions already &s;et down. One thing farther de&s;erves here highly to be con&s;ider'd, that Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>, who profe&s;&s;es to build all on the Scripture, does yet &s;eem to endeavour to &s;et a&s;ide the&s;e <HI>Scriptural</HI> Terms <HI>Create</HI> and <HI>Creature</HI>; while him&s;elf u&s;es &s;everal <HI>&V;n&s;criptural</HI> ones of his own in their &s;tead: And that he does this chiefly on the uncertain Authority of <HI>Irenaeus</HI>; who, among the four Words made u&s;e of by him as to the Origin of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>Prolationem, Generationem, Nuncupationem</HI>, and <HI>Alapertionem</HI>, has but one of them, that is of certain, and &s;acred Authority, while the other Three are of uncertain, and human, or rather of heretical Original. I beg of Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> to &s;hew us how this Procedure of his is con&s;i&s;tent with the main De&s;ign and very Title of his Book.

<P>But becau&s;e I had al&s;o written &s;omewhat by way of Conclu&s;ion, at the &s;ame time that I prepared the fore|going Defence, I &s;hall add it in this place.</P>
<P>And now, to draw towards a Conclu&s;ion, it is here Articled and Objected again&s;t me, that <Q>&startq;I am a Prie&s;t in Holy orders of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; and that I have formerly Sub&s;cribed to the Common-Prayer-Book, and to the 39 Articles; which Com|mon-Prayer-Book and 39 Articles, are contrary to
<PB N="140" REF="142">
&endq;the Doctrines here by me a&s;&s;erted."</Q> Now, as to this Article or Objection again&s;t me, I mu&s;t own it to be true; that when I was con&s;iderably younger than I now am; when I was much more Ignorant and unacquainted with the Primitive State of Chri|&s;tianity than I now am; while I went on too ea&s;ily according to the Cu&s;tom of the Times, and the no|tions of my Education; while I was not &s;ufficiently aware of the Snares laid for me, by &s;uch Sub&s;cription, nor of the pernicious tendency of &s;uch A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent, I did too ra&s;hly and ha&s;tily Sub&s;cribe, and too Ra&s;hly and Ha&s;tily give my A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent, as the re&s;t of my Brethren of the Clergy did: for which I heartily now do beg Pardon of God and of all good Men. But then, at the &s;ame time I plead, that a&s;&s;oon as I came to a more mature Judgment, and to a more exact Knowledge of Things; a&s;&s;oon as I had made any Progre&s;s in that careful Examination which I have &s;ince gone through; a&s;&s;oon as I had compar'd the Common-Prayer-Book, and 39 Articles with the ancient Creeds, the Holy Scriptures, the mo&s;t Primitive Fathers, and the ancient Councils, I was abundantly &s;atisfyed, that the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Do|ctrines and Practices, contain'd in that Common-Prayer-Book and in tho&s;e 39 Articles, were utterly unju&s;tifyable by tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Records, and were no better than Branches of that Fatal Here&s;y, which was almo&s;t begun by <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, many Years after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>; and which in after Ages, together with the other parts of Popery, prevail'd over the Chri&s;tian Church. Accordingly I did from that very time firmly re&s;olve to have no more to do with any &s;uch Sub&s;criptions, any &s;uch A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent here|after; that I would act openly and &s;incerely before the Chri&s;tian World; that I would both by Di&s;|cour&s;e and Writing endeavour &s;eriou&s;ly to convince the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> of their novel and pernicious Er|rors, and of their novel and dangerous Practices;
<PB N="141" REF="143">
and to recover, as far as I was able, the Primitive Faith, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Practice, as it was originally &s;ettled from Chri&s;t him&s;elf, by his Holy Apo&s;tles, and their Companions: I fully determined to do all this at the hazzard of my ea&s;e, my prefer|ment, my e&s;tate, my reputation; and, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to call me to it, of my Life it &s;elf. Ac|cordingly I appear here as a Criminal before you on account of this my firm adherence to that old Chri|&s;tianity; and I Confe&s;s before you all, in the words of St <HI>Paul</HI>, that <HI>After the way which</HI> the modern cor|rupt Ages have long <HI>called Here&s;y, Act.</HI> xxiv. 14.15, 16. <HI>&s;o Wor&s;hip I the God of my Fathers; belie|ving all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets. And have Hope towards God, which you your &s;elves al&s;o allow, that there &s;hall be a Re&s;urrection of the Dead, both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t. And herein do I exerci&s;e my &s;elf, to have alway</HI> in the&s;e, as well as in all other things, <HI>a Con&s;cience void of Offence, toward God, and toward Men</HI>. I may add al&s;o, that tho' I do not de&s;ire to bring any needle&s;s trouble or Per&s;ecution on my &s;elf, nor would be without ju&s;t cau&s;e guilty of my own or Families undoing, e|ven in this World, yet do I profe&s;s, with the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, Act. xx. 23, 24. that Tho' <HI>Bonds and Affli|ctions</HI> &s;hould <HI>abide me</HI>, for this my &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s, <HI>Yet do none of the&s;e things move me:</HI> Neither, as I humbly Hope, &s;hould I <HI>Count my Life dear to my &s;elf, So that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the Mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the&s;e</HI> plain Branches of the <HI>Go&s;pel of the Grace of God</HI>. I do therefore here again own and te&s;tify to you all, that upon the mo&s;t full and impartial Examination I have been able to make, and that after &s;incere pray|ers for the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, direction and ble&s;&s;ing all along, I &s;till believe that the Doctrines I am here accu&s;ed for, are the real Doctrines of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles; that the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions,
<PB N="142" REF="144">
the &s;upport of which I am here impeached for, are al&s;o really Canonical Books of the New-Te&s;tament, and do, without Que&s;tion, contain the original &s;et|tlements of Chri&s;tianity, the true Faith, Laws, Di&s;|cipline, and Devotions of the very fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel; that, by con&s;equence, all the modern Churches, and in particular this Church of <HI>England</HI>, how much &s;oever &s;ome of her Members may cry her up, as the <HI>be&s;t Con&s;tituted Church in the World</HI>, and as <HI>intirely agreeable to Primitive Antiquity</HI>, have &s;ore|ly deviated from tho&s;e original Settlements, and have thereupon not &s;eldom e&s;tabli&s;h'd Fal&s;e Doctrines for True, Human laws for Divine, Modern Tradi|tions for Chri&s;tian Rules, and have almo&s;t lo&s;t that regular and truly Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline, which is of principal concern in order to the Conver&s;ion, Edi|fication, and Salvation of Men: that accordingly they are all of them, and our Church in particular, Oblig'd to make a &s;erious review of tho&s;e their &s;eve|ral Con&s;titutions, and to reduce them exactly to the Primitive Standards; that they are all bound, and our Church in particular, in&s;tead of Di&s;couraging and pro&s;ecuting any hone&s;t Men that in the &s;incerity of their Hearts, and without all &s;ini&s;ter affections en|deavour to tell them the plain Truth, and call them to a farther Reformation, to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t them; and to amend what is ami&s;s, when upon a fair Examination any thing &s;hall appear to be &s;o. This, I &s;ay, is certainly the plain Duty of the Church, and of its Governors in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. But then, till I &s;ee &s;ome likely-hood of &s;uch a Chri&s;tian Procedure, and while in&s;tead of that I perceive Violence and Pro&s;ecution do take Place, I do here publickly Di&s;|claim and Recal tho&s;e Sub&s;criptions, that A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent which I am here accu&s;ed of having formerly made; and I de&s;ire it as a favour of this Court, that they will plea&s;e to take care that my Name be blotted or eras'd out of all tho&s;e Records where it now ap|pears,
<PB N="143" REF="145">
in way of Sub&s;cription to that Liturgy, or tho&s;e 39 Articles. I de&s;ire this Court will plea&s;e to take notice farther, that if Per&s;ecution, in&s;tead of Reformation, is to be hereafter the Characteri&s;tick of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of <HI>England</HI>, that I do here|by al&s;o Di&s;claim any farther &s;trict member&s;hip with her, and declare my &s;elf no longer to be peculiarly a Presbyter of the &s;ame Church. And I do, in con|&s;equence thereof, Declare that, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;hall think my &s;elf, no longer under the &s;ame Obli|gations of con&s;tant communion with her; that I have hitherto been &s;o careful of; but &s;hall look up|on my &s;elf more at liberty than ever to act as a Chri|&s;tian in General, and as a Presbyter of the Chri&s;tian Church in General, for the time to come. Nor in|deed do I much more affect the Reputation of &s;trict Member&s;hip with, or Prie&s;thood in the Church of <HI>England</HI>, if &s;he once becomes a Per&s;ecuting Church, than I do in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, which has been notoriou&s;ly &s;uch for many Ages. For tho I do not pretend that the one is at all in the &s;ame degree corrupted as the other, yet wherever the &s;pirit of Per&s;ecution on account of Con&s;cience and Religion Reigns, I look on any Church as &s;o far Antichri&s;tian in its Con&s;titution; And, by con&s;equence, I cannot but &s;uppo&s;e that if this Church of <HI>England</HI>, which has been hitherto one of the lea&s;t given to that un|chri&s;tian Practice of all the Reformed Churches, does again relap&s;e into that wicked Spirit, &s;he is be|ginning to repent of her former Reformation, and to &s;ink back into Popery again. And if &s;o, I and all the true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;ts Religion &s;hall be o|blig'd to cry out to the Chri&s;tians of her communion, as in effect the fir&s;t Reformers did, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 17. <HI>Come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparate, and touch not the unclean thing.

my Temper, my Education, nor my Intere&s;t incline me to &s;peak things &s;o grating and di&s;agreea|ble, to &s;uch eminent Members of this Church, as this Court con&s;i&s;ts of. But you all know that I have long, and earne&s;tly laboured for fair Hearing, calm Enquiry, impartial Examination, and a peaceable Correction of what is ami&s;s in the Church; but all to no purpo&s;e. So that my &s;trict adherence to truth and &s;incerity; my firm regard to Chri&s;tianity, and to my &s;acred Function as a Chri&s;tian Clergy-Man, who by his Office is not to fear any thing in the di&s;charge of his Duty, oblige me to deal &s;o freely in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now, my Lords, beg leave to end all with a &s;omewhat long, but mo&s;t Remarkable Pa&s;&s;age of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>, upon no very unlike occa&s;ion; I mean when he was &s;eiz'd and conven'd before the Nobles of <HI>Judah</HI> in the days <HI>Jehoiakim</HI>, and was in danger of being put to Death, for his plain &s;incerity and open boldne&s;s in delivering ungrateful truths to them. Nor &s;hall I fear to de&s;ire your Application of his ca&s;e to that before you; tho' I pretend to no immediate In&s;piration: nor is it in your Power to take away my Life. For, How weak and frail &s;oever I be my &s;elf, yet am I &s;till a Chri&s;tian Clergy Man, or an Amba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, &s;o far as I keep clo&s;e to his Commi&s;&s;ion; and I endeavour with all &s;incerity and openne&s;s to di&s;charge my Mini&s;terial Duty, and in Chri&s;t's name to deliver my Me&s;&s;age, with all faithful|ne&s;s, and this at the hazzard of my intere&s;t, and &s;afe|ty, and liberty in this World. And if the Doctrines I am here judged for prove at la&s;t, in&s;tead of Here&s;y, to be the very Doctrines of our Lord and Ma&s;ter Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by whom all Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are &s;ent, as I am fully &s;atisfyed they will; I beg you will &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider whether you can with &s;afety to your &s;elves as well as ju&s;tice to me re&s;olve to Condemn me for hone&s;tly and openly maintaining them.

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALtho' you was not pleas'd to return any An|&s;wer to that Letter which I long &s;ince wrote to you by Mr. <HI>Clements</HI>, concerning your &s;elf, and your former Conduct at <HI>A&s;ton</HI>; and &s;o o|mitted to vindicate your &s;elf in that Matter: Which Letter I was therefore oblig'd in Ju&s;tice, after &s;ome time, to permit the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Bi&s;&s;et</HI>'s Modern Thanatick, <HI>Part</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 19, 20.</NOTE> Per&s;on concern'd to print, for his own Vindication: Yet have I thought fit to try whether you will vouch&s;afe to give me an An&s;wer, and do me Ju&s;tice in a Point of much greater Mo|ment; and &s;uch wherein Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf is deep|ly concern'd: I mean as to tho&s;e grievous Imputati|ons
<PB N="149" REF="151">
which, at your Tryal, you laid upon me. I had &s;aid in my <HI>Sermons and E&s;&s;ays</HI>, that, <HI>When the Scrip|tures &s;peak of One God, they mean thereby One Supreme God the Father only</HI>: &mdash; That <HI>The Moderns call'd the&s;e Three Divine Per&s;ons but One God; and &s;o intro|duc'd at lea&s;t a new, and un&s;criptural, and inaccurate, if not a fal&s;e way of &s;peaking into the Church</HI>, I had al|&s;o, by my Noting &s;ome <HI>Errata</HI>, order'd the Particle <HI>in</HI> to be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of <HI>and the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>, in a Doxology; and de&s;ir'd the Reader to blot out that Expre&s;&s;ion; <HI>Three Per&s;ons and One God</HI>, which I had made u&s;e of before my di&s;tinct Examination of tho&s;e Matters. The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages you were pleas'd to pick out of that Book, and to lay them before the Queen, the Parliament, the Nation, nay, almo&s;t the whole Chri|&s;tian World, as In&s;tances, in whole, or in part, of <HI>Bla&s;phemy, Irreligion</HI>, and <HI>Here&s;y</HI>. Upon this, in my <NOTE N="dagger" PLACE="foot">Pag. 46, 47, 48.</NOTE> <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript</HI> to my &s;mall <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Epi&s;tles of</HI> Ig|natius, publi&s;h'd &s;oon after, which I al&s;o reprinted in my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 81, 82, 83.</NOTE> <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>, I ventur'd to <Q>&startq;A&s;&s;ure you that tho&s;e were my own Words; and were a|greeable to my own not uncertain Opinion, but certain Faith: that tho' I had once been in the com|mon Opinion, that the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, the Three Divine Per&s;ons, were truly, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, <HI>One God</HI>, or <HI>the One God</HI> of the Chri|&s;tian Religion; yet that it was before I particular|ly examin'd that Matter in the Scriptures, and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers: but that &s;ince I had throughly enquir'd into it, I was &s;o fully &s;atisfied that the <HI>Father alone</HI> is the <HI>One God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that I own'd, that when once I could de|ny, or doubt of that Doctrine, I mu&s;t deny, or doubt of our common Chri&s;tianity; &s;ince there is no one Article more plain, or more univer&s;ally ac|knowledg'd
<PB N="150" REF="152">
in all the fir&s;t Ages of the Church. And I ventur'd farther &s;olemnly to Challenge You, and all your more Learned Friends, to produce <HI>One &s;ingle</HI> direct Te&s;timony of any Chri&s;tian, and &s;trict|ly Catholick Writer, before <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, who &s;aid, the <HI>Three Per&s;ons were One God</HI>, or <HI>The One God</HI>; and declar'd, I was ready to produce <HI>above an Hun|dred</HI> plain Te&s;timonies on the other &s;ide, that This <HI>One God</HI> is no other than <HI>God the Father</HI>; as indeed the fir&s;t Doctrine which the <HI>Catechumens</HI> learn'd, and the grand Foundation of our whole Religi|on. I did al&s;o acknowledge, that 'I thought, be|fore Examination, that the Doxology current in all the&s;e latter Ages, <HI>Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> was the true Chri&s;tian Doxology; but was fully &s;atisfy'd upon Enquiry, that it was not &s;o, but thus; <HI>Glory be to the Father, by the Son, in the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> and more rarely, <HI>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, in the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> and profe&s;s'd my &s;elf prepar'd to &s;hew, that tho&s;e were the true Chri&s;tian Doxologies, beyond &endq;rea&s;onable Contradiction.</Q> Ever &s;ince which time I have in vain expected from your &s;elf, and your Friends, any Satisfaction. I have, however, made no farther Demands upon you, during the whole time of your Legal Silence and Re&s;traint, nor while there was no manner of Relation between us. But &s;ince all Re&s;traint is now remov'd, and you are fully at Liber|ty to Preach, as well as Write about the&s;e Important Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; and You, as well as your Friends, have had a long Time, and many Invitati|ons, and Opportunities, to examine upon what &s;mall Foundation tho&s;e Imputations &s;tand; Nay, &s;ince you are become the Legal Rector of this Pari&s;h, wherein I live, and &s;o ought to judge impartia$$y about me and my Doctrines, in order to my Read mi&s;&s;ion here to the Holy Communion; from which I have &s;o long been excluded: which yet I can neither think fit to

de&s;ire, nor can expect you to grant, while you look upon me as guilty of no le&s;s Crimes than <HI>Bla&s;phemy, Irreligion</HI>, and <HI>Here&s;y:</HI> I do therefore here renew my former Challenge, or rather make a New and an <HI>Earne&s;t Invitation</HI> to You, and all your Learned Friends, either to Own, or An&s;wer what I did there alledge, and am very ready to prove in the mo&s;t Au|thentick Manner, for my own Ju&s;tification. And I do accordingly hereby make my &s;olemn Appeal to all the Original Sacred and Primitive Records of our Religion, even as late as the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf, and &s;everal Years afterwards, for the certain Truth of what is there &s;aid. And as you ventur'd to pro|duce my Words before mention'd in the mo&s;t open manner, and before the mo&s;t Publick A&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;i|ble, as In&s;tances of &s;uch <HI>Bla&s;phemy, Irreligion</HI>, and <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, I claim it at your Hands, that you make me &s;uitable Amends in my Reputation; and if you can|not Defend your Charge, you will Confe&s;s your Mi&s;take, and the Fal&s;hood of tho&s;e Imputations you laid upon me; and this, as near as may be, in the like Open and Publick Manner; in order to both my Vindication, and the Vindication of tho&s;e Sacred Doctrines, and that certain Practice of our Holy Religion, which you did there &s;o ra&s;hly reproach and &s;tigmatize; but which I, as a Chri&s;tian, ever think my &s;elf bound to believe and obey, as undoubt|ted Branches of that Religion. Accordingly, I do intreat it of you as a Point of Favour, or rather de|mand it of you as a Piece of Ju&s;tice, that you will ap|point a proper Time and place, for a Friendly Con|ference or Di&s;putation, upon the&s;e Important Points between us. I am de&s;irous it may be as publick as po&s;|&s;ible; becau&s;e the publick Nature of the Matters concern'd, and the publick Place where you laid the Charge again&s;t me, do &s;o require. However, I am very willing that you procure what A&s;&s;i&s;tance you plea&s;e from all your Learned Friends, or engage any

If them to &s;upply your Place; provided I al&s;o be al|low'd the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Acquaintance of my own, on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion.

I de&s;ire al&s;o, that every thing may be deliver'd in Writing on both Sides, to prevent all Mi&s;takes, and Pretences of Mi&s;repre&s;entation. All that I farther beg for, and in&s;i&s;t on in the pre&s;ent Matter, both with You, your Friends, and indeed all the Clergy; and that on Behalf of my &s;elf, and tho&s;e of my Per&s;ua&s;ion, as well as of Truth and Chri|&s;tianity, is this; That if they dare not di&s;pute with any of us in publick, where we have Liberty to &s;peak for our &s;elves, they will not in publick Preach, or in private Talk again&s;t us, where they know we have no &s;uch Liberty or Opportunity. That there may be no longer room for that Su&s;picion, which is ready to be entertain'd by many, That not a few of the Clergy cannot in private vindicate, and do not inwar$ly believe, many of tho&s;e common Doctrines, which yet in publick they Preach, and in private Maintain to the People. And give me Leave to &s;ay, that till the Occa&s;ions of this Su&s;picion are by &s;ome means or other taken away, the Clergy will be more and more expos'd to Contempt: and will be more and more &s;u&s;pected, neglected, and reproach'd by the free and unbia&s;s'd Part of Mankind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A LETTER</HI> from Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>, to the Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>, to be commu|nicated to His Grace the Lord Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, and the Bi|&s;hops of his Province.</HEAD>

<P>SINCE by living within the Bounds of your Lord&s;hip's Pari&s;h or Dioce&s;e, I am &s;o far under your Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction, that I cannot &s;o regularly apply my&s;elf to any other of your Lord|&s;hip's Order as to your &s;elf: Since your Lord|&s;hip has therefore &s;o far a Right to take an account of my Behaviour, as a Chri&s;tian Pari&s;hioner, and as a Presbyter of the Church; and I am &s;o far under an obligation of giving you an Account under both tho&s;e Capacities of my Conduct, and have &s;o far a Right to Advi&s;e and Con&s;ult with your Lord&s;hip in any of my Spiritual Difficulties and Perplexities: Upon the&s;e Foundations, and with this View, I do here, in great &s;incerity, and with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, take leave to make this my Addre&s;s to your Lord&s;hip, not only on my own behalf, but al&s;o on behalf of &s;uch others as are of my Per&s;ua&s;ion in Religious mat|ters;
<PB N="154" REF="156">
and do beg your Lord&s;hip's Pa&s;toral Advice and Direction, what we are to do in a Point of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to our bounden Duty, and our greate&s;t Intere&s;t; to our peace of Con&s;cience here, and to our eternal Salvation hereafter. You are not, I believe, my Lord, unapprized of the &s;tate of things here, with relation to my&s;elf, and many o|thers; nor of tho&s;e Controver&s;ies which have now for &s;everal Years been &s;tarted and carried on con|cerning the Doctrine of the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, and the Wor&s;hip that is to be di&s;tinctly paid to every one of tho&s;e Sacred Per&s;ons. Nor can you, &s;ure, be in|tirely in&s;en&s;ible how plainly it has appeared, that the common Notions, of late current among us, have been little better than the gro&s;s Here&s;y of <HI>Sa|bellius</HI> on one &s;ide, and direct Trithei&s;m on the o|ther; that the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were &s;till of another Mind, and, own'd God the Father as alone the One Supreme God of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and the Son, as God indeed, but deriv'd from and &s;ub|ordinate to him: While the Holy Spirit was never originally called God, and never directly Invocated by them at all, before the Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>. Your Lord&s;hip al&s;o cannot &s;ure but know, that after the numerous Pamphlets and Attempts to &s;upport the common Notions, the mo&s;t Learned do find they cannot be &s;upported; as is very evident in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e of the Learned Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>; who has &s;o ful|ly &s;atisfy'd the World in the&s;e Points, that the ve|ry upper Hou&s;e of Convocation it&s;elf, and your Lord|&s;hip in particular, upon the con&s;ideration of this mat|ter, have con&s;ented to drop any Pro&s;ecution of him; and, notwith&s;tanding his known di&s;agreement from the Vulgar Notions, to leave him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not only of his Right of Member&s;hip, as a Lay Per&s;on, but of his Holy Orders, and of the principal Cure of Souls in your Dioce&s;e. This has been the calm and Chri&s;tian behaviour of the Upper Hou&s;e of
<PB N="155" REF="157">
Convocation, and among them, of your Lord&s;hip in particular upon this occa&s;ion. And this, my Lord, gives cau&s;e of Joy, and hopes of the like calm and Chri&s;tian treatment to my &s;elf and to others, who are in great mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Sentiments with Dr <HI>Clarke</HI>, as to tho&s;e important Points: Tho' I confe&s;s. We think our&s;elves oblig'd to Speak, and Write, and Act more plainly, clearly, and openly: and dare not &s;often or mollify any branch of what we e&s;teem Chri&s;t's true Religion, in compliance with any modern No$$$$s, or Temporal Inducements, or out of reg$$d to any Human Authority what&s;oever. And indeed, I hope We have a right to be &s;o much the more e&s;teemed the Objects of Chri&s;tian Moderation and Suffer$$ce, as we are willing and de&s;irous to keep more intirely clo&s;e to the Chri&s;tian Faith, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;ci|pline, without all &s;u&s;picious compliances, and with a more intire regard to the original Standards, as we find they were believed and practic'd in the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel, than he has done. I do not mean by this magi&s;terially to Cen&s;ure Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI> or any others, in what they have formerly or lately Written, or Declared, or Acted: <HI>To their own Ma|&s;ter they mu&s;t Stand or Fall</HI>: But &s;o far I may ven|ture to &s;ay again; that &s;ince I dare not for any con|&s;ideration in this World, do what I am clearly per|&s;uaded is not agreeable to the perfect &s;incerity of a Chri&s;tian, I hope, that this my former, and my pre|&s;ent open and &s;incere Declaration of my Mind, in all &s;uch Matters, will not hinder, but promote your Lord&s;hip's and the Church's candid forbearance and Chri&s;tian treatment of me, and tho&s;e of my Per&s;ua|&s;ion, on the like occa&s;ion. If your Lord&s;hip plea&s;e to peru&s;e the following Accounts and Letters, which I have formerly Printed, before your Lord&s;hip came to this Dioce&s;e, and do here tran&s;cribe, you will readily perceive the Cau&s;e of this Application; what it is that I complain of; what it is that I de&s;ire and

in&s;i&s;t on from your Lord&s;hip. Permit me then to lay them before you in their native Simplicity, and to &s;uppo&s;e that what I there &s;ay to Mr. <HI>Shute</HI>, or rather by him to my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chich&s;teer</HI>, is in effect now &s;aid to your Lord&s;hip, only with all due variation of Circum&s;tances; and with that great ag|gravation of the complaint, which &s;o much longer an exclu&s;ion from the Holy Communion, may ju&s;tly ex|tort from me.</P>
<P><Q>'The la&s;t additional Hard&s;hip which I mu&s;t com|plain of, is what goes near my Heart indeed,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Po&s;t&s;cript to Hi&s;tor. Pref. <HI>p. 71,&mdash;74.</HI></NOTE> and that is, that I &startq;have been for &s;ome Months ex|cluded from the Holy Communi|on, and that directly for doing my Duty to my Lord and Saviour; and, as I think, without any even legal Incapacity that can be pretended again&s;t me. This I can truly &s;ay has drawn from me &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion of Concern, as none of the other In&s;tances of Severity ever did; and which I own to be a &s;ore Tryal to me. But this whole Matter will he be&s;t under&s;tood from two Letters which I wrote to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Shute</HI>, one of the Curates of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Pari&s;h, wherein I live; and to which I have never yet receiv'd any full and &endq;proper An&s;wer.</Q> They here follow <HI>verbatim</HI>.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;MY Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI>, the Rector of this Pari&s;h, did &s;ome time ago de&s;ire me for a little while, to forbear coming to the Week|ly Communion, on account of the Debates about me in Convocation at that time; and us'd this as the principal Argument to me, That this Ab&s;ence
<PB N="157" REF="159">
de&s;ir'd needed to be only for a little while. I have, upon his Lord&s;hip's de&s;ire, ab&s;ented my &s;elf for &s;ome time accordingly; to &s;hew at once my regard to his Lord&s;hip, and to the Peace of the Church and Pari&s;h; without being &s;en&s;ible all the while of any Incapacity either in point of Con&s;ci|ence, or Law, but that on all accounts I may, and if I may I am certainly in Duty bound to frequent that Holy Communion; as the New Te&s;tament, and the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions enjoyn me. Nay farther, I have been inform'd, that about that ve|ry time when my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> de&s;ir'd my ab&s;enting my&s;elf for a while, the Lord Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e had, upon Application, told my Lord of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> that the Communion was not to be deny'd me. The Convocation indeed have, &s;ince that time, cen&s;ur'd &s;everal Opinions which they take to be mine. But then they have not proceeded again&s;t me at all; nor &s;o much as Cited me to appear. The Cen&s;ure is no way authen|tickly publi&s;hed; but indeed rather &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. Nor has the Queen, to whom it has been pre&s;ented, at all ratify'd the &s;ame. So that it can no way legally affect me. I do therefore take it to be my Duty, as a Chri&s;tian, and my Right as a Member of this Church and Pari&s;h to receive the Holy Communion con&s;tantly in this Place: And as I am very willing and de&s;irous to perform that Duty; &s;o do I in&s;i&s;t on that Right: and beg that the Lord Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e, and the Rector of the Pari&s;h may be inform'd of my Intention to offer my&s;elf accordingly, that no Surprize or Di&s;order may be in the lea&s;t occa&s;ion'd &endq;thereby.</Q> I am,</P>

<P><Q>&startq;I Suppo&s;e you have before this time, received the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Determination, as to my Admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's-Supper. Nay indeed I have had &s;ome information as to that Determi|nation; tho' not authentickly, nor from Your &s;elf; I therefore let you know that I expect an Account of it from you in a little time; that I may come to &s;ome re&s;olution about my own Practice. I am very unwilling to be excluded from the Commu|nion, on no other account, but becau&s;e I have hone&s;tly done my Duty as a Chri&s;tian. And yet I am very unwilling to be the occa&s;ion of what a|ny may call a Schi&s;m or Separation. Nor &s;hall I ea&s;ily attempt any &s;uch thing, while I, and others of my Per&s;ua&s;ion, are admitted to &s;uch Commu|nion with the Church: But cannot tell but it may be our Duty to &s;et up &s;uch publick Wor&s;hip as we can with a good Con&s;cience more intirely join in, if we are deny'd the other. I have al&s;o had Advice; and find that, by the Laws of <HI>England</HI>, I cannot be refus'd the Communion. So that if it be now refu&s;ed me, it &s;eems to be by &s;uch a Seve|rity or Rigour as the pre&s;ent Settlement cannot ju&s;tify; and &s;uch as may have Effects by no means to the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who are in&s;trumental in it. However, I openly take you to Witne&s;s, that in ca&s;e I hereafter find it to be my Duty to &s;et up any publick Wor&s;hip different from that e&s;tabli&s;h'd among us, it will not be till I was de|liberately, and by tho&s;e in Authority, refu&s;ed this mo&s;t &s;olemn In&s;tance of communion with the Church of <HI>England</HI>.

not, without ju&s;t cau&s;e, to deny me the advantage of this Holy Ordinance of our Religion: I obte&s;t and conjure you that you will not hinder me from my bounden Duty, nor deprive me of my great|e&s;t Privilege. I am indeed to be ea&s;y under any temporal Penalties which come upon me in the cour&s;e of my Duty; as I always endeavour to be: Yet am I not to be alike ea&s;y in the want of Chri&s;t's &s;acred Appointments, and the ordinary means of Salvation. Nor do I well know how I can, con&s;i&s;tently with this my Duty to my Lord and Saviour, go on contentedly any longer in the other In&s;tances of communion with the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, if I be not al&s;o admitted to this Holy Ordinance.

I mu&s;t own, my Lord, that there is rea&s;on to doubt whether tho&s;e that are &s;atisfy'd of the greatne&s;s of the Cor|ruptions in the pre&s;ent Churches, and how very far they have all receded from the old Doctrine, Wor|&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline of the Go&s;pel, and of the va&s;t|ly better and more undoubted Authority there is for that wonderful and mo&s;t excellent Settlement contain'd in the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, as I ac|knowledge my&s;elf to be; ought not wholly to leave the publick and legal E&s;tabli&s;hments, and to &s;et up other in di&s;tinct Religious A&s;&s;emblies, or truly Chri&s;tian Churches. But yet, becau&s;e our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf appear'd long to communicate with even the Jewi&s;h corrupt Church, while he was on Earth; becau&s;e the danger and mi&s;chiefs of Sepa|ration
<PB N="161" REF="163">
are u&s;ually very great; and becau&s;e quiet and peaceable Chri&s;tians, among whom I ever de|&s;ire to be, are willing &s;till to hope that the Bi&s;hops and Governors of the Church, may in time con|&s;ider better of the&s;e important Matters, and at length find out a way for a more regular and pub|lick Reformation; I am di&s;pos'd to wait &s;till lon|ger, with patience, without any &s;uch open Separa|tion from the publick Admini&s;trations: I mean this, in ca&s;e I and others of my Per&s;ua&s;ion be o|penly allow'd the advantage of all the In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, without any oppre&s;&s;ion upon our Con|&s;ciences. Otherwi&s;e I do not know how it will be con&s;i&s;tent with that perfect Sincerity which the Go&s;pel requires, and the known Obligations of Chri&s;tianity, either hypocritically to conceal our real Sentiments and Convictions, in order to full Communion; or to content our &s;elves with the continual Omi&s;&s;ion of &s;o expre&s;s a Duty and main privilege of Chri&s;tianity. As to my &s;elf, I hear|tily pray to God that my neglect of the Holy Eu|chari&s;t &s;o long, even in my late Circum&s;tances, may not be imputed to me for an Offence before God; who will call us to account, as well for tho&s;e Sins we have been guilty of, out of regard to Men and their Authority, as for any other. However, I dare not venture on any farther in that Neglect. But do in&s;i&s;t upon it, that I be again admitted to the Communion here, as I was &s;o long formerly, without Di&s;turbance. Your Lord&s;hip cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that all pretences in any re|gular way again&s;t my admi&s;&s;ion are over. I am under no manner of cen&s;ure, either from the Bi|&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s, or the Arch-bi&s;hop of the Province. The Convocation have not &s;o much as review'd their cen&s;ure upon my Doctrines, &s;ince tho&s;e Doctrines, and their Evidence have been in|tirely Publick. That very Cen&s;ure is not, I think,
<PB N="162" REF="164">
yet become at all the Legal Act of the Convoca|tion. Her Maje&s;ty has not only not confirm'd it, but, as I under&s;tand, has plainly dropt it; and &s;o di&s;courag'd any farther proceedings upon it: the truly Learned and Judicious do either own that my Doctrine is for the main true, or by their ob|&s;tinate Silence do plainly confe&s;s they cannot con|fute it. Nay, as your Lord&s;hip will find by the paper herewith &s;ent, the very principal foundation of the Charge again&s;t me fails; and what I have been chiefly cen&s;ur'd, and was in danger of being con|demn'd for, proves now to be the Doctrine and Language of the Church in general, even at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>: And what has &s;o long been deem'd Heretical, on the &s;uppos'd Authority of that Council, appears now to be only owing to the Knavery and Forgery of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>. So that I hope all difficulties are at la&s;t remov'd, and I may freely attend your weekly communions, as I did formerly; and as both the Con&s;titutions of our Lord by his Apo&s;tles, and the known Books of the New Te&s;tament do oblige me to do. Good my Lord, Have regard to the de&s;ires of one that asks for nothing, but that he may have leave to <HI>Offer his Euchari&s;tical Oblation in its appointed Sea&s;ons</HI>; may be permitted to act like a Chri&s;tian; and may not by any &s;everity of your's, be forc'd either to live without the Holy Euchari&s;t, like a Jew or Heathen; or to &s;eek it el&s;ewhere, with &s;uch haz|zard of publick di&s;turbance to the Church on one &s;ide, and of per&s;ecution to my &s;elf on the other, as I am no way inclinable to incur; Unle&s;s I per|ceive it to be matter of plain Duty, and obligation of Con&s;cience: In which ca&s;e I hope no worldly Motives &s;hall have the lea&s;t influence upon me. In order to prevent the&s;e difficulties I intend, My Lord, &s;oon to offer my &s;elf at the Holy Table in &endq;this Pari&s;h; but am very de&s;irous to have &s;ome in|timation

<LETTER>
<P><Q>&startq;Not long after the receipt of this Letter My Lord of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> &s;ent me a Verbal An&s;wer to it, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Shute</HI> one of the Readers of the &s;ame Pari&s;h, formerly mention'd on the like Occa&s;ion. It was to this effect; that he had received my Letter, and had thereupon con&s;ulted with my Dioce&s;an, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>, and with the re&s;t of his Brethren, and, tho' he was &s;orry for it, yet that he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure me that if I &s;hould of|fer my &s;elf at the Communion he mu&s;t refu&s;e it me, &endq;on account of the offence I had given the Church.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, My Lord, are the Accounts and Letters I mean: And this the great and, I think, ju&s;t com|plaint which I am forc'd to make to your Lord&s;hip, that I am &s;till excluded the Communion of the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Church, in her mo&s;t &s;acred Euchari&s;tical Office, becau&s;e I am &s;o &s;incere in my Chri&s;tianity that I dare not renounce or di&s;&s;emble any of its &s;a|cred Truths, when upon the fulle&s;t enquiry and mo&s;t abundant evidence, I am intirely &s;atisfyed they are Branches of Chri&s;ts true Religion: and this while I have all along communicated hitherto with the Church, &s;o far as in Con&s;cience I could, and as I have been permitted to do it, without an attempt for any Separation: And while even no legal Cen|&s;ure or Incapacity lies upon me, which &s;hould be any hindrance to my Admi&s;&s;ion to that &s;acred Ordi|nance.</P>
<P>Permit me farther, My Lord, to lay before your Lord&s;hip that great regard that I have paid the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Church, even under the apprehen&s;ion of be|ing
<PB N="164" REF="166">
cut of from her, or oblig'd to leave her, by my choo&s;ing rather to correct, and to improve her Li|gy, for my own u&s;e, and tho&s;e of my Per&s;ua&s;ion, than to think of joining directly, with any of tho&s;e other Bodies of Chri&s;tians which are divided from her; by choo&s;ing to alter her forms no more than the very nature of Chri&s;tianity plainly requir'd; and by making a great part of tho&s;e alterations from no other than her own fir&s;t and be&s;t Reformed Litur|gy, own'd for &s;uch by many of her late and pre&s;ent mo&s;t Learned and Pious Members. This Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI>, thus improv'd and cor|rected, and that with the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of not a few of the be&s;t and mo&s;t Learned in her Com|munion al&s;o, is now &s;uch that I may venture to &s;ay, all the Members of this Church, who are &s;ufficiently skilled in, and &s;et a due value upon true Chri&s;tian Antiquity, mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is much better, and much more agreeable to the mo&s;t ancient re|mains of Chri&s;tianity than that which is here or a|ny where now E&s;tabli&s;h'd by Legal Authority; and yet withal not &s;o different from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd one, as to de&s;erve to be e&s;teem'd properly another; but is rather the &s;ame Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;till; only corrected and improv'd according to the Primitive Ages. Give me leave therefore, My Lord, to in&s;i&s;t upon it, both with your Lord&s;hip and the re&s;t of the Governors of this Church, as highly rea&s;onable, that &s;uch of the Clergy or Laity as plea&s;e may have the liberty to u&s;e this Liturgy, without being e&s;teem'd Separati&s;ts or Di&s;&s;enters from her; that tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who may de&s;ire to Wor&s;hip God the neare&s;t of all other Bodies to the way of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, may not be cen|&s;ured or di&s;turbed by her, while &s;he permits all the re&s;t to act according to their own Con&s;ciences in &s;uch Matters, without any Di&s;turbance. And I take leave to hope, that while all other &s;orts of Re|ligious
<PB N="165" REF="167">
Per&s;ons are indulg'd and &s;ecur'd in &s;uch their Chri&s;tian Liberty, tho&s;e that mu&s;t be allow'd by all, to follow mo&s;t &s;trictly the Laws and Directions of our old genuine uncorrupt Chri&s;tianity &s;hall not be the only Per&s;ons excluded from publick Favour and Countenance, at lea&s;t not from publick Forbea|rance and Toleration. I cannot therefore but ex|pect and in&s;i&s;t that the Church will either openly al|low and invite me, and all tho&s;e of my Per&s;ua&s;ion, to communicate intirely with her; notwith&s;tanding our known and avowed Di&s;&s;ent in &s;uch points of Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice, as no Chri&s;tians in three Centuries were oblig'd to Profe&s;s or Practice; (in which ca&s;e I hope we &s;hall be very tender of doing any thing which &s;hall be lyable to the imputation of any proper Separation from her;) or however, that &s;he will freely permit us to Wor&s;hip God according to the way of that Reformed Liturgy herewith pre|&s;ented to your Lord&s;hip. Nor can it be other than highly rea&s;onable to expect one of the&s;e conditions from her: Since otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t either go on in the con&s;tant neglect, of the principal part of pub|lick Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the known Laws of the Go&s;pel, and which I am confident your Lord&s;hip will not advi&s;e us to: Or we mu&s;t endeavor to join our &s;elves with &s;ome of the other Di&s;&s;enting Bodies, which the Church looks on as di|rectly Sinfull and Schi&s;matical: and which therefore I may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip will not approve of. This, My Lord, is &s;incerely my ca&s;e, and the ca&s;e of others of my Per&s;ua&s;ion. And it is a ca&s;e of &s;o much Hard&s;hip and Difficulty, and Concern to our &s;elves, and to the Church, that we do very much want and de&s;ire your Chri&s;tian, your Pa&s;toral Ad|vice and In&s;truction therein. What your Lord&s;hips Thoughts may be I cannot tell: But as to my own, I mu&s;t freely profe&s;s that I incline to the &s;econd way propos'd, the u&s;e of that Reformed Liturgy, as mo&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="168">
agreeable to &s;incerity, to the revealed Will of God, and to the propagation of Truth and genuine Chri|&s;tianity among us; as mo&s;t unexceptionable in point of Con&s;cience, and perhaps not more exceptionable in point of prudence and publick peace al&s;o. For which my Opinion I will at any time, upon the lea&s;t intimation from your Lord&s;hip, be ready to give my rea&s;ons more largely. However, I am very willing and de&s;irous to hear the Sentiments and rea&s;ons of a|ny pious and &s;erious Chri&s;tians; e&s;pecially of any of the Learned among them; and mo&s;t of all of any of the Governors and Bi&s;hops of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, and particularly of your Lord&s;hip, our Honoured Dioce&s;an: to whom therefore I do hereby humbly apply my &s;elf on this account.

<P>ALtho' you have taken &s;everal occa&s;ions, &s;ince I have been in the Pari&s;h where you are Lectu|rer, to divert from that more &s;erious and u&s;eful way of practical Preaching, which in general you &s;eem careful to pur&s;ue; [and from which, whenever you or others do digre&s;s, either to Political or Religious Controver&s;ies, give me leave to &s;ay it, they &s;eldom do &s;o either to their own Reputation with the be&s;t Judges, to the conviction of Gain&s;ayers, or to the edification of their Congregations;] yet have I had that great regard to your other u&s;eful Labours and good Character here, and to the Temper you have generally &s;hewed in your Reflections on me my Noti|ons and Writings hitherto, as to avoid giving you any Trouble. But then you were betrayed to &s;o much unbecoming a&s;&s;urance and warmth in your Sermon this Day, and that in a point &s;o utterly un|ju&s;tifiable,
<PB N="169" REF="171">
as is that of the <HI>Equality</HI> of the Son to the Father, and of the <HI>Equality</HI> of that <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> which is due to him; and this you &s;upported by evi|dence to very weak, and texts &s;o fal&s;ely &s;o tran&s;lated or utterly perverted; you did al&s;o &s;o plainly inti|mate, without all ground, that this my A&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the Son, and by con&s;equence of the <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> divine Wor&s;hip which is due to him, was a branch of the very <HI>Arian Here&s;y</HI> it&s;elf; that I could not hear all this without great concern and regret. I was &s;orry that one whom I thought other|wi&s;e a Good Man, &s;hould make u&s;e of the advantage of that Sacred Place of the Pulpit; which in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;erves commonly for little more than for &s;ecurity a|gain&s;t Oppo&s;ition from the Learned, and to give ad|vantage for impre&s;&s;ion on the ignorant; to in&s;till &s;uch unju&s;tifiable Notions and Practices into your Hearers: While I was confident, by what you &s;aid, that you either was no ma&s;ter at all of the Argument; or if you were, that you mu&s;t know you &s;pake with great a&s;&s;urance about what there was very little evidence for: Nay, what, in that ca&s;e, you mu&s;t know there was very great evidence again&s;t in all the old Records of Chri&s;tianity. When I hear Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> preach &s;uch things, as I &s;ometimes do from the &s;ame Pulpit, I am not &s;o much &s;urprized, becau&s;e his Character makes me expect no better; And his con&s;tant &s;up|po&s;al of the Infallibility of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in his preaching, admits of no other. But when Mr. <HI>Broughton</HI> undertakes to treat of &s;uch important Points, I expect &s;omewhat more con&s;iderable. Tho' I cannot but &s;ay that I have herein been frequently di&s;appointed in my expectations from you; and ne|ver more than when this Day you openly and bold|ly a&s;&s;erted tho&s;e things to your Congregation, as evi|dent and unan&s;werable, which you could hardly e|&s;cape knowing to be very far otherwi&s;e; and which I am pretty well a&s;&s;ured you would not have been
<PB N="170" REF="172">
&s;o po&s;itive about any where but in the Pulpit. And indeed I cannot but wonder to hear very often things dogmatically a&s;&s;erted and earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd in that Place, which the Preacher, I dare &s;ay, would hard|ly venture at all to ju&s;tify el&s;ewhere, in any &s;ort of Learned conver&s;ation; and which are commonly known to be ill-grounded and unju&s;tifiable; and have thereupon been given up by the Wi&s;e Men of all Parties. The rea&s;on of which, in plainly un&s;incere Men, I can ea&s;ily gue&s;s at: But what to &s;ay for it in &s;uch as have any Character for fairne&s;s and integri|ty I cannot tell. Nor do I think it at all tolerable in any who are forced to own the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the Sun to the Father, as the wi&s;e&s;t of the Orthodox mo&s;t certainly do; to oppo&s;e, as you did, tho&s;e that &s;ay the Wor&s;hip and Glory due to him mu&s;t in kind be <HI>Subordinate</HI> to that given to the Father. However, &s;ince you have been pleas'd Openly in my hearing, to preach what I believe to be Unchri&s;tian Doctrine to this great Pari&s;h, I cannot but expect it of you that you as openly Defend it; and that in &s;ome other way than from the Pulpit; which you know I &s;hall not be permitted to make u&s;e of. I mean, ei|ther by publick Conference, or by the Pre&s;s. And I do the rather claim this piece of Ju&s;tice of you on three accounts; One is becau&s;e Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>, who us'd to preach again&s;t me, and procure others to preach for him that did &s;o, has refu&s;ed the &s;ame Invitation long ago, and &s;o I have no other Per&s;on belonging to this Pari&s;h whom I can &s;o ju&s;tly expect it from as your &s;elf. Another is, becau&s;e you have not on|ly vouch&s;afed to have a &s;ort of real private Con|ference with Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>, about &s;omewhat which re|motely concerns the&s;e Points; but have permitted publick Accounts to go abroad in the Prints, with|out any publick Contradiction, of your gaining Victories and Triumphs over him in &s;uch Conferen|ces about the&s;e Points them&s;elves, when there never
<PB N="171" REF="173">
were any &s;uch Conferences at all. And the third is, becau&s;e I would fain have all Tricking laid a&s;ide, and have hone&s;t Chri&s;tian People never taught any &s;uch Doctrines from the Pulpit, which the Teacher is a&s;hamed to defend before them when he is out of it: Which Art yet, I doubt, is very common with too many; but will mo&s;t certainly, by degrees, as it comes to be more and more di&s;cover'd, expo&s;e the Clergy to the utmo&s;t Contempt and Di&s;grace po&s;|&s;ible. I beg of you, Sir, therefore, in ca&s;e you don't re&s;olve all into the Infallibility of the pre&s;ent Church, as you have any regard for the honour of God, the reputation of the Clergy, the truths and duties of the Go&s;pel it&s;elf, and the great Account we mu&s;t all make to our common Lord at the Great Day, that if you have not in earne&s;t &s;tudied the&s;e Points in the old Records of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o cannot judge au|thentickly of them, that you will no more meddle with them in your Sermons: But that if you think you are &s;ufficiently a Ma&s;ter of them to Preach about them, that you will al&s;o conde&s;cend to have a Friendly Conference, as publick as your Preaching to be all done by Papers delivered on both &s;ides: Or at lea&s;t that you will Print &s;uch your Sermons, with what Addi|tions you plea&s;e, that I may have the opportunity to Defend my&s;elf, and tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Doctrines I em|brace, publickly, before the Inhabitants of this Pari&s;h, and before all the World, in a Vindication. If you plea&s;e to grant me the fir&s;t branch of this la&s;t reque&s;t, I will join with you in procuring leave from our Dio|ce&s;an for that purpo&s;e: And in the other ca&s;e there is no occa&s;ion for asking it. So, in expectation of a Friendly and Chri&s;tian An&s;wer, to what proceeds from no unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition to you, and from an hearty concern for genuine Chri&s;tianity, I take leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' yours pretends to bear the Date of Sun|day was Sev'night, when my Sermon was preach'd, it could not reach my Hou&s;e in the next Street by <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Noon, at which time I &s;et out for <HI>King&s;ton</HI>, and there receiv'd the Letter in a Parcel the other Day; which I Remark only that you &s;hould not think me dilatory in this, or that yours requir'd much Con&s;ideration; for indeed the only thing in debate with my&s;elf was, whether I &s;hou'd give it any Notice at all. However you &s;ee I have determin'd in your Favour for once. The main drift of your Letter, is to propo&s;e or rather demand printing my Sermon of that Day, and &s;uch others wherein I have taken occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>E&s;&s;ential Divinity</HI> of our B. Saviour; or 2<HI>dly.</HI> That I wou'd con&s;ent to have a Conference with you, as publick as tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es have been. As to Printing, I believe you will be content with this &s;hort An&s;wer, that I have often refu&s;ed the De&s;ire of Friends, and &s;hall not be over-born by the importunity of others in that Article: And as to the Conference, I refu&s;e that al&s;o; for this very good Rea&s;on, that the Let|ter it&s;elf which makes the Demand, does in my Judgment, forbid the Compliance. For 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> In this very Letter, you have already mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly mi|&s;taken, and mo&s;t perver&s;ely abu&s;ed the Argument as it lies in my Sermon. The &s;ub&s;tance of your Com|plaint is, that I have deny'd the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the

Son to the Father, which you vainly arrogate to your &s;elf as your own Notion. Whereas, neither the Word, nor the Thing meant by it, fell within the compa&s;s of that Argument. My Text led me to a&s;&s;ert, that the Scripture a&s;cribed the &s;ame Glo|ry to Father and Son; and then as a Con&s;equence of this, argued for the <HI>E&s;&s;ential Dignity</HI> of the Son: And here ended the Doctrinal Part, with a Refle|ction I confe&s;s on the <HI>Arians</HI>. But I enter'd not at all upon the Point of the <HI>Subordination</HI>; which was not needful and would have po&s;tponed the Practi|cal part of my Di&s;cour&s;e: And therefore, whether I hold the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the Son, or not, is more than you know; and con&s;equently more than, in Mode&s;ty, you ought to have a&s;&s;erted. And I might re&s;t &s;ecurely in this Defence alone. But I will here obviate al&s;o whatever you can reply to this Cen|&s;ure; and that is, when I a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame Glory and Wor&s;hip to belong to the Father and Son, I do, by con&s;equence, de&s;troy the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the Son, there being a repugnancy to each other in the things them&s;elves. That this is the utmo&s;t you can &s;ay, I collect from two di&s;tant places in your con|fu&s;ed Letter. The fir&s;t is, <HI>That this my A&s;&s;ertion of the</HI> Subordination <HI>of the Son, and by con&s;equence of the</HI> &s;ubordinate divine Wor&s;hip <HI>which is due to him</HI>, &amp;c. The other is, <HI>Nor do I think it at all tolerable in any who are forced to own the</HI> Subordination <HI>of the Son to the Father, to oppo&s;e, as you did, tho&s;e that &s;ay the Wor|&s;hip and Glory due to him mu&s;t in Kind, be</HI> &s;ubordi|nate <HI>to that given to the Father</HI>. Now here ob&s;erve that, as, according to your own Account, I oppo|&s;ed the <HI>Subordination</HI>, no otherwi&s;e than as the &s;ame Divine Glory and Wor&s;hip which I a&s;&s;erted, may con&s;equently de&s;troy it: So you a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Sub|ordinate Glory</HI> and Wor&s;hip, no otherwi&s;e than as
<PB N="174" REF="176">
a con&s;equence of the <HI>Subordination</HI> it&s;elf: And both deductions are of your own, not my making. And is not this very mode&s;t in you, whom I have heard rail at the whole Engli&s;h Clergy (and that before an Arch-Bi&s;hop) for pre&s;uming to rea&s;on con&s;equen|tially from Scripture? (You knowing very well, how far &s;uch con&s;equential Rea&s;oning wou'd carry our Lord Je&s;us above the Character of <HI>a dear Creature</HI>, as I then heard you term him.) But there is no Sin in the Saints: For now you a&s;&s;ume to your &s;elf, and indeed have all along a&s;&s;umed, the liberty of rea&s;oning Con&s;equentially; nay, and of drawing Con&s;equences from my Words, which you know not whether I had any View of or not: Nay, la&s;tly, you have taken to your &s;elf the decent freedom of rea&s;oning by fal&s;e and ab&s;urd Con&s;equences, even while you are precluding us from drawing tho&s;e that are mo&s;t evident and nece&s;&s;ary. To prove this la&s;t Charge (for the other two are already evident) I tell you 1<HI>st.</HI> That we of the Church of <HI>England</HI> pro|fe&s;s to give the &s;ame Glory and Wor&s;hip to the Father and Son, with an ab&s;olute con&s;i&s;tency with all that <HI>Superiority</HI> and <HI>Subordination</HI>, which is ne|ce&s;&s;arily implied in the relative Terms of Father and Son. And &s;ince we do thus profe&s;s, as I do for one at pre&s;ent, then neither by a&s;&s;erting the former, do we deny the latter; and &s;o the whole Charge in your Letter upon me is fal&s;e, and the Foundation of our Conference quite taken away. But you will &s;till urge, that in this profe&s;&s;ion we are not con&s;i&s;tent with our &s;elves and the Truth; and therefore I &s;ay, 2<HI>dly.</HI> That, whereas this Accu&s;ation ought, of all other things, to be made good, it is only taken for granted in this Letter, and throughout tho&s;e of your Works that I have &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177">Sir, I have brought you now to that main Point which you &s;hould have labour'd to prove in your Letter, to &s;ave it from plain Impertinence; but of which, to my amazement, you have not one word, unle&s;s I'll take your own for it; <HI>nor do I think it tolerable</HI>, &s;ay you: But I mu&s;t tell you your Thoughts without your Arguments, in this Capital Point, are intolerable. For my own part, I do humbly con|ceive I can prove, by the Te&s;timony of Scripture, Rea&s;on a&s;&s;enting too, the perfect con&s;i&s;tency be|tween the two Things before mentioned; and by God's help, will attempt it on a proper occa&s;ion: But this was no way incumbent upon that Sermon, which did not de&s;cend to the Point. But let me tell you, 'tis a Duty ab&s;olutely incumbent on every Objector to our Doctrine, to demon&s;trate the con|trary; it being one main Point of difference between the <HI>Trinitarian</HI> and the <HI>Arian</HI> Scheme; and that which brings us directly to the whole merits of the Cau&s;e. Yet this Article Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> is always wil|ling to &s;lur over: which I think no Man of his Learn|ing, joyn'd with Veracity, cou'd be guilty of, unle&s;s he were touched in his Head. Which latter, that it is your unhappy, tho' more innocent Ca&s;e, &s;ome of your be&s;t Friends, I can prove, have acknowledged as freely as the World reports it; which I mention with no other de&s;ign than as a Rea&s;on, by the By; why, under this per&s;wa&s;ion, I may be allow'd to re|fu&s;e your de&s;ire of a Conference, without any ri&s;que of my own Reputation. In the mean time, this &s;tumbling at the Thre&s;hold, in mi&s;apprehending and mi&s;repre&s;enting my Words, deliver'd in a &s;olemn Di&s;cour&s;e, is it&s;elf to me a &s;ufficient Bar to a Con|ference, that's never like to be determined, or to determin any thing. 2<HI>dly.</HI> If fal&s;e Zeal, and a furi|ous unchri&s;tian Spirit, may forbid Conference and
<PB N="176" REF="178">
and Conver&s;ation too, I a&s;&s;ign this for another Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>I know not what occa&s;ion I have given Mr. <HI>Whi|&s;ton</HI> to put upon me the hard Dilemma of the Knave or the Fool; <HI>either I am no ma&s;ter at all of the Argu|ment</HI>; and then I was a Fool at lea&s;t, to treat &s;o often of it in Publick; <HI>or I &s;pake with great A&s;&s;urance about what there was very little Evidence for; nay, what I mu&s;t know there was very great Evidence again&s;t</HI>; and then I was a downright Knave. Nay, by and by the Fool is thrown out of the Ca&s;e; <HI>I have a&s;|&s;erted openly and boldly tho&s;e things as evident and unan&s;werable to my Congregation, which I can hardly e&s;cape knowing to be far otherwi&s;e</HI>. And again; <HI>I would fain</HI> (&s;ay you) <HI>have all Tricking laid a&s;ide</HI>; which I pre&s;ume you wrote to me, that I might ap|ply it to my&s;elf. Whereupon I make but this one &s;oft Reflection, That it is indeed to be forgiven on the Foundation of Chri&s;tianity, but is in it&s;elf no good Foundation for a Chri&s;tian Conference. Be|&s;ides, this Language, and indeed all the Language you u&s;e, &s;hews your Mind to be &s;o fixed and rive|ted in your Notion, that I cannot expect any Rea|&s;oning of mine, if good in it&s;elf, &s;hou'd do any good upon you: No! I verily believe (and I think upon flagrant Evidence) that you wou'd be no more mov'd with an Argument that really de&s;troy'd your Scheme, than a Stone receives Sen&s;ation from the Hammer that breaks it. But 3<HI>dly.</HI> This Letter puts yet a &s;tronger Bar to my Conferring with you, by the Specimen you have already given me, not only of uncharitable ha&s;ty Expre&s;&s;ions, but of premeditated Fal&s;hood and In&s;incerity. After your telling me of a <HI>certain private Conference with Dr.</HI> Clarke, <HI>about &s;omething remotely concerning the&s;e Points</HI>, you add, <HI>That I have permitted publick Ac|counts
<PB N="177" REF="179">
to go abroad in the Prints, without any publick Contradiction, of my gaining Victories and Triumphs o|ver him, in &s;uch Conferences about tho&s;e points them|&s;elves, when there never were any &s;uch Conferences at all</HI>. Whereupon I make bold to ob&s;erve 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> 'Tis fal&s;e that the publick Prints did di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>tho&s;e points them&s;elves</HI>, and tho&s;e <HI>remotely concerning them</HI>; but only &s;aid we had a Conference together, and the Subject of which was ea&s;ily under&s;tood by every Reader: And yet it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for you to make this groundle&s;s di&s;tinction, or el&s;e what you reproach me with of <HI>no &s;uch Conference at all</HI>, had been an open palpable fal&s;hood, whereas 'tis now only a Covert one; for 2<HI>ly</HI> That &s;ort of Conference (as you mince the Matter) did con|cern, in the fir&s;t Place, Dr. <HI>Clark's</HI> management of the&s;e Points them&s;elves; and next it directly Went upon the Points them&s;elves: I propo&s;ing to over|throw the whole <HI>Arian</HI> Scheme, by one general Argument; after I had lay'd it down as an <HI>Axiom</HI> that the Scriptures we have are the true Word of God: which was allowed as an Axiom between the Dr. and me. (Tho' I know it is no Axiom between Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> and me: I having heard you &s;ay that no Author was ever &s;o abu&s;ed as St <HI>John</HI> the Evange|li&s;t has been: which the Di&s;cour&s;e we were upon evinces you could mean no otherwi&s;e than as to the Genuinene&s;s of tho&s;e Writings, which pa&s;s under his Name in our Canon of Scripture.) The time wou'd not &s;uffer me to proceed, with him, to &s;eve|ral other of tho&s;e Points, con&s;equential and &s;ub&s;e|quent to that Argument; but I have de&s;ired, and &s;till do de&s;ire to go thro' all tho&s;e Points them&s;elves, with one of his excellent Under&s;tanding, joyn'd with &s;o good a Temper; and you may, if you think it a &s;utable Employment, be pleas'd to carry him the Me&s;&s;age. In the mean time, I &s;olemnly declare that I was not concerned, either directly or indirectly,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
in the publication of tho&s;e Adverti&s;ements; but nei|ther was I concerned, in point of truth to contradict them. And now I &s;ee clearly, in what Mint that printed Calumny was forged, which plainly inti|mates that I publi&s;hed them my &s;elf: It is indeed an Honour to me that I am thought worthy to fall un|der the &s;ame Virulent Pen, which has &s;truck at the whole Body of the Engli&s;h Clergy; but then I &s;hould be as devoid of Prudence, as you are of Patience, did I tru&s;t my &s;elf &s;o far with you, as Conferences &s;eem to require I &s;hou'd; for I find already you are not the mo&s;t exact Reporter of Conferences.</P>

You do in|deed, with &s;ome Ju&s;tice, intimate my Ignorance of the Old Records of Chri&s;tianity, tho' you I think never found that Ignorance out.
