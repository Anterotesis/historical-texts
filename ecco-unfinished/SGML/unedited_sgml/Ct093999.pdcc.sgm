<HEAD>PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE EDITOR.</BYLINE>
<P>HAVING, in the year &s;eventeen hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, put forth A HISTORY OF MUSIC, in five volumes quarto, (which buy) notwithdanding my then avocations, as Ju&s;tice of the Peace for the county of Middle&s;ex and city and liberty of We&s;tmin&s;ter, I, Sir John Hawkins, of Queen-&s;quare, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Knight, do now, being &s;till of &s;ound health and under&s;tanding, e&s;teem it my bounden duty, to &s;tep forward as Editor and Revi&s;er of THE PROBATIONARY ODES. My grand rea&s;on for undertaking &s;o arduous a ta&s;k is this; I do from my
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
&s;oul believe that Lyric Poetry is the own, if not twin-&s;i&s;ter of Mu&s;ic; wherefore, as I had before gathered together every thing that any way relates to the one, with what con&s;i&s;tency could I forbear to collate the be&s;t effu&s;ions of the other?&mdash; I &s;hould premi&s;e that in volume the fir&s;t of my quarto hi&s;tory, chap. I. p. 7, I lay it down as a principle never to be departed from, that
<Q>&startq;The Lyric is the &endq;prototype of the fidicinal &s;pecies.</Q>
And accordingly I have therein di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at large both the origin, and various im|provements of the Lyre; from the tor|toi&s;e-&s;hell &s;cooped and &s;trung by Mer|cury, on the banks of the Nile, to the te&s;tudo exqui&s;itely poli&s;hed by Terpander, and exhibited to the Aegyptian Prie&s;ts. I have added al&s;o many choice engravings of the various antique Lyres, viz. the Lyre of Goats-horns, the Lyre of Bulls-horns, the Lyre of Shells, and the Lyre of both Shells and Horns compounded; from all which, I flatter my&s;elf, I have indubitably proved the Lyre to be very
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
far &s;uperior to the Shank-bone of a Crane, or any other Pipe, Fi&s;tula, or Calamus, either of Orpheus's or Linus's invention; aye, or even the be&s;t of tho&s;e pul&s;atile in&s;truments commonly known by the denomination of the drum.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much, therefore, as all this was finally proved and e&s;tabli&s;hed by my Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic, I &s;ay I hold it now no alien ta&s;k to &s;omewhat turn my thoughts to the late divine &s;pecimens of Lyric Min&s;trel&s;y. For although I may be deemed the legal Guardian of MUSIC alone, and con&s;equently not in &s;trictne&s;s bound to any further duty than that of her immediate Ward&s;hip; (See Burn's Ju&s;tice, article Guardian:) yet &s;urely in equity and liberal feeling, I cannot but think my&s;elf very forcibly incited to ex|tend this tutelage to her next of kin; in which degree I hold every individual follower of THE LYRIC MUSIC, but more e&s;pecially all &s;uch part of them as have devoted, or do devote their &s;trains to the celebration of tho&s;e be&s;t of themes,
<PB N="x" REF="7">
the Reigning King and the current year &mdash;Or in other words, of all Cithari&s;tae Regis, Ver&s;ificatores Coronae, Court Poets, or as we now term them Poets Laureate. &mdash;Pau&s;anias tells us, that it plea&s;ed the God of Poets him&s;elf by an expre&s;s Oracle, to order the inhabitants of Del|phi to &s;et a part for Pindar one half of the fir&s;t-fruit offerings, brought by the religious to his &s;hrine, and to allow him a place in his temple, where in an <HI>iron</HI> chair, he was u&s;ed to &s;et and &s;ing his <HI>hymns</HI> in honour of that God. Would to heaven that the Bench of Bi&s;hops would, in &s;ome degree, adopt this ex|cellent idea&mdash;or at lea&s;t that the Dean and Chapter of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the other Managers of the Abbey Mu&s;ic meetings, would in future allot the oc|ca&s;ional vacancies of Madam Mara's &s;eat in the Cathedral Orche&s;tra, for the re|ception of the Reigning Laureat, during the performance of that favourite con|&s;titutional ballad, "May the King live for ever." It mu&s;t be owned, however,
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
that the Laureat&s;hip is already a very kingly &s;ettlement; one hundred a year, together with a tierce of canary, or a butt of &s;ack, are &s;urely mo&s;t princely endowments, for the honour of litera|ture, and the advancement of political genius. And hence (thank God and the King for it) there &s;carcely ever has been wanting &s;ome great and good man, both willing and able to &s;upply &s;o im|portant a charge.&mdash;At one time we find that great immortal genius, Mr. Tho|mas Shadwell, (better known by the name of Og and Mac Flacknoe) chaunt|ing the prerogative prai&s;es of that ble&s;&s;ed Aera.&mdash;At a nearer period, we ob&s;erve the whole force of Colley Cibber's ge|nius, devoted to the labours of the &s;ame reputable employment.&mdash;And finally, in the example of a Whitehead's Mu&s;e, expatiating on the virtues of our gra|cious Sovereign; have we not beheld the be&s;t of Poets, in the be&s;t of ver&s;es, do|ing ample ju&s;tice to the be&s;t of Kings? &mdash;The fire of Lyric Poe&s;y, the rapid
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
lightning of modern Pindarics, were equally required to record the Virtues of the Stuarts, or to immortalize the Ta|lents of a Brun&s;wick.&mdash;On either them there was ample &s;ubject for the bolde&s;t flights of inventive genius, the full &s;cope for the mo&s;t daring powers of poetical creation; from the free unfettered &s;train of liberty, in honour of Charles the Fir&s;t, to the kindred Genius and congenial Talents that immortalize the wi&s;dom and the worth of George the Third.&mdash; But on no occa&s;ion has the ardour for prerogative panegyrics &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly flamed forth, as on the late Election for &s;ucceeding to Mr. Whitehead's honours. To account for this unparalleled &s;truggle, let us recollect that the ridiculous re|forms of the late Parliament having cut off many gentlemanly offices, it was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence that the few which were &s;pared became objects of rather more emulation than u&s;ual. Be&s;ides, there is a decency and regularity in pro|ducing, at fixed and certain periods of
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
the year, the &s;ame &s;ettled quantity of metre on the &s;ame unalterable &s;ubjects, which cannot fail to give a particular attraction to the Office of the Laureat|&s;hip, at a cri&s;is like the pre&s;ent.&mdash;It is admitted, that we are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of much &s;ounder judgment, and more regulated ta&s;te than our ance&s;tors had any idea of; and hence does it not im|mediately follow, that the occupancy of a political office, which, from its uni|formity of &s;ubject and limitation of du|ty, precludes all ha&s;ty extravagance of &s;tyle, as well as any plurality of efforts, is &s;ure to be a more plea&s;ing object than ever to gentlemen of regular habits and a becoming degree of literary indolence. Is it not evident too, that in compo&s;i|tions of this kind, all fermentation of thought is certain in a very &s;hort time to &s;ub&s;ide and &s;ettle into mild and gentle compo&s;ition&mdash;till at length the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this grave and orderly office, prepare their &s;tipulated return of metre, by as proportionate and gradual exertions, as
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
many other cla&s;&s;es of indu&s;trious tenants provide for the due payment of their particular rents. Surely it is not too much to &s;ay, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of Lau|reat to his Maje&s;ty, is, under &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion, to the full as ingenious, reputable, and as regular a trade, as that of Al|manack Maker to the Stationers Com|pany.&mdash;The conte&s;t therefore for &s;o ex|cellent an office, having been warmer in the late in&s;tance than at any preceding period, is perfectly to be accounted for; e&s;pecially too at a time, when, from nobler cau&s;es, the Soul of Genius may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to kindle into uncommon enthu&s;ia&s;m, at a train of new and unexampled prodigies. In an age of Reform; beneath the mild &s;way of a Briti&s;h Augu&s;tus; under the Mi|ni&s;try of a pure immaculated Youth; the Temple of Janus &s;hut; the Trade of Otaheite open; not an angry Ameri|can to be heard of, except the Lottery Loyali&s;ts; the fine Arts in full Glory; Sir William Chambers the Royal Archi|tect;

Lord Sydney a Cabinet Mini&s;ter! What a golden Aera! From this au&s;pi|cious moment, Peers, Bi&s;hops, Baronets, Methodi&s;ts, Members of Parliament, Chaplains, all genuine Beaux E&s;prits, all legitimate Heirs of Parna&s;&s;us, ru&s;h forward with unfeigned ardour, to de|light the world by the united efforts of liberal genius and con&s;titutional loyalty.

To the great Tribunal of the Public, the whole of this important con|te&s;t is now &s;ubmitted.&mdash;Every document that can illu&s;trate, every te&s;timony that tends to &s;upport the re&s;pective merit of the Probationers, is impartially commu|nicated to the World of Letters.&mdash;Even the Editor of &s;uch a collection, may hope for &s;ome rever&s;ionary &s;ame from the humble, but not inglorious ta&s;k, of col|lecting the &s;cattered rays of Genius.&mdash;
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">
At the eve of a long laborious life, de|voted to a Si&s;ter Mu&s;e, (vide my Hi&s;tory, printed for T. Payne and Son, at the Mews Gate) po&s;&s;ibly it may not wholly appear an irregular vanity, if I &s;ome|times have entertained a hope, that my tomb may not want the &s;ympathetic re|cord of Poetry.&mdash;I avow my motive.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is with this expectation I appear as an Editor on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.&mdash;The Authors who&s;e Compo&s;itions I collect for public notice are twenty-two. The odds of &s;urvivor&s;hip, according to Doc|tor Price are, that thirteen of the&s;e will outlive me, my&s;elf being in cla&s;s III. of his ingenious tables.&mdash;Surely there|fore, it is no mark of that &s;anguine di&s;|po&s;ition which my enemies have been plea&s;ed to a&s;cribe to me, that I deem it po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome one of the &s;ame thir|teen, will requite my protection of their harmonious effu&s;ions with a &s;train of elegiac gratitude, &s;aying, po&s;&s;ibly (par|don me, ye Survivors that may be, for pre&s;uming to hint the thought to minds

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE FOLLOWING excellent ob&s;ervations on the Lyric &s;tyle, have been kindly communicated to the Editor by the Rev. Thomas Warton&mdash;They appear to have been taken almo&s;t verbatim from &s;everal of the former works of that ingenious author; but chiefly from his late edition of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Minora</HI>. We &s;incerely hope, therefore, that they may &s;erve the double purpo&s;e of enriching the pre&s;ent collection, and of attracting the public attention to that very critical work from which they are principally extracted.</P>

<P>IT was in obedience to the advice of my brother, Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, that I came to a determination on the 5th of May ult. to compo&s;e my fir&s;t. Birth-day

Ode, at the elevation of one mile above the earth, in the Balloon of my inge|nious friend Mr. James Sadler of this city. Accordingly, having agreed for the &s;ame, at a very moderate rate per hour, (I paying all charge of inflating, and &s;tanding to repairs) at nine in the morning, on Friday, the 20th of &s;aid month, I repaired to Chri&s;t-church Mea|dow, with my balla&s;t, provi&s;ions, cat, Speaking-Trumpet, and other nece&s;&s;aries. &mdash;It was my fir&s;t de&s;ign to have invited Dr. Jo&s;eph to have a&s;cended with me; but apprehending the malicious con&s;truc|tion that might follow on this, as if, for&s;ooth, my intended Ode was to be a joint production, I e'en made up my mind to mount alone.&mdash;My provi&s;ions principally con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall pot of &s;tewed prunes, and half of a plain diet-bread cake, both prepared and kindly pre&s;ented to me by the &s;ame ingenious hand which had fabricated the Balloon.&mdash; I had al&s;o a &s;mall &s;ub&s;idiary &s;tock, viz. a loaf of Sandwiches, three bottles of
<PB N="xl" REF="37">
old ale, a pint of brandy, a &s;allad ready mixed, a roll of collar'd eel, a cold goo&s;e, &s;ix dam&s;on tartlets, a few China oranges, and a roa&s;ted pig of the Chine&s;e breed; together with a &s;mall light baro|meter, and proper &s;tore of writing uten|&s;ils, but no note, memorandum, nor loo&s;e hint of any kind. So help me God!&mdash;My a&s;cen&s;ion was maje&s;tic, to an uncommon degree of tardine&s;s. I was &s;oon con&s;trained therefore to lighten my Balloon, by throwing out &s;ome part of my balla&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ted of my own Hi&s;tory of Poetry, my late edition of Milton's Minora, my Mi&s;cellaneous Ver&s;es, Odes, Sonnets, Elegies, In&s;crip|tions, Monodies, and Complaints; my Ob&s;ervations on Spen&s;er, the King's la&s;t Speech, and Lord Mountmorres's pam|phlet on the Iri&s;h Re&s;olutions. On throwing out his Lord&s;hip's E&s;&s;ay, the Balloon &s;prung up &s;urpri&s;ingly; but the weight of my provi&s;ions, &s;till retarding the elevation, I was fain to part with both volumes of my Spen&s;er, and all of
<PB N="xli" REF="38">
my la&s;t edition of Poems, except tho&s;e that are marked with an a&s;teri&s;k, as never before printed: which very quickly ac|celerated my a&s;cen&s;ion&mdash;I now found the barometer had fallen four inches and &s;ix lines in eight minutes.&mdash;In le&s;s than eleven minutes after, I had a&s;cended very con&s;iderably indeed, the barometer having then fallen near &s;eventeen inches; and pre&s;ently after I entered a thick black cloud, which I have &s;ince found render|ed me wholly ob&s;cure to all ob&s;ervation. In this &s;ituation I lo&s;t no time to begin my Ode; and accordingly, in the cour&s;e of 25 minutes, I produced the very lines which now commence it. The judicious critic will notice, that ab&s;ence of the plain and trite &s;tyle which mark the pa&s;|&s;age I refer to; nor am I &s;o uncandid to deny the powerful efficacy of mi&s;t, dark|ne&s;s, and ob&s;curity, on the &s;ublime and my&s;terious topics I there touch on: It cannot fail al&s;o to &s;trike the intelligent ob&s;erver, that the expre&s;&s;ion &s;o much commented on, of "<HI>No echoing car</HI>," was
<PB N="xlii" REF="39">
obviou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted by that very car in which I my&s;elf was then &s;eated&mdash;Finding however that, together with the increa&s;ed den&s;ity of the over&s;hadowing cloud, the coldne&s;s al&s;o was proportionably in|crea&s;ed, &s;o as at one time to freeze my ink completely over, for near 20 minutes, I thought it prudent, by means of open|ing the valve at the vertex of my Bal|loon, to emit part of the a&s;cending power. This occa&s;ioned a proportionate de&s;cent very &s;peedily: but I mu&s;t not overlook a phaenomenon which had pre|viou&s;ly occurred&mdash;It was this: On a &s;udden the nibs of all my pens (and I took up 48, in compliment to the num|ber of my Sovereign's years) as if at|tracted by a polar power, pointed up|wards, each pen erecting it&s;elf perpen|dicularly, and re&s;ting on the point of its feather. I found al&s;o, to my no &s;mall &s;urprize, that, during the whole of this period, every one of my letters were actually cut top&s;y-turvy wi&s;e; which I the rather mention, to account for any
<PB N="xliii" REF="40">
appearance of a corre&s;pondent inver&s;ion in the cour&s;e of my ideas at that period.</P>
<P>On getting nearer the earth, the ap|pearances I have de&s;cribed altogether cea&s;ed, and I in&s;tantly penned the &s;econd divi&s;ion of my Ode, I mean that which &s;tates his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty to be the patron of the fine arts. But here (for which I am totally at a lo&s;s to ac|count) I found my&s;elf de&s;cending &s;o very rapidly, that even after I had thrown out not only two volumes of my Hi&s;tory of Poetry, but al&s;o a con&s;iderable portion of my pig, I &s;truck, neverthele&s;s, with &s;uch violence on the weather-cock of a church, that unle&s;s I had immediately parted with the remainder of my balla&s;t, excepting only his Maje&s;ty's Speech, one pen, the paper of my Ode, and a &s;mall ink-bottle, I mu&s;t infallibly have been aground. For|tunately, by &s;o rapid a di&s;charge, I pro|cured a quick re-a&s;cen&s;ion: when im|mediately, though much pinched with the cold, the Mercury having &s;uddenly fallen 22 inches, I &s;et about my con|cluding

&s;tanza, viz. that which treats of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t excellent cha&s;tity. And here I lay my claim to the indul|gence of the critics to that part of my Ode; for what with the &s;hock I had re|ceived in &s;triking on the weather-cock, and the effect of the prunes which I had now nearly exhau&s;ted, on a &s;udden I found my&s;elf very much di&s;ordered in|deed. Candour required my ju&s;t touch|ing on this circum&s;tance, but delicacy mu&s;t veil the particulars in eternal obli|vion. At length, having completed the great object of my a&s;cent, I now re|opened the valve, and de&s;cended with great rapidity. They only who have travelled in Balloons, can imagine the &s;incere joy of my heart, at perceiving Dr. Jo&s;eph cantering up a turnip-field near Kidlington-common, where I landed ex|actly at a quarter after two o'clock; having, from my fir&s;t elevation, com|pleted the period of five hours and fifteen minutes; four of which, with the fraction of ten &s;econds, were entirely devoted to

my Ode.&mdash;Dr. Jo&s;eph quite hugged me in his arms, and kindly lent me a &s;econd wig, (my own being thrown over at the time of my &s;triking) which, with his u&s;ual precaution, he had brought in his pocket, in ca&s;e of accidents.

All the editors of Horace have hitherto read <HI>adjectis</HI> Britannis.

B. <HI>Abject</HI>, in the author's under&s;tanding of the word, means that preci&s;e degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due from a free people to monarchy. It is further wor|thy remark, that Horace wrote the ode alluded to, before Britain was &s;ubjected to ab&s;olute &s;way; and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;age was meant as a prophetic compliment to Augu&s;tus.

<P>AS I under&s;tand you are publi&s;hing an authentic Edition of the Probationary Odes, I call upon you to do me the ju&s;tice of in&s;erting the enclo&s;ed. It was rejected on the Scrutiny by Signor Delpini, for
<PB N="105" REF="144">
rea&s;ons which mu&s;t have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the male|volence of &s;ome rival. The&s;e rea&s;ons were, 1&s;t, That the Ode was nothing but pro&s;e written in an odd man|ner; and, 2dly, that the metre, if there be any, as well as many of the thoughts, are &s;tolen from a little Poem in a Collection, called the UNION. To a man, ble&s;t with an ear &s;o delicate as your's, Sir John, I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing on the fir&s;t charge; and as to the &s;econd, (would you believe it?) the Poem from which I am accu&s;ed of &s;tealing, is my own. Surely an Author has a right to make free with his own ideas, e&s;pecially when, if they were ever known, they have long &s;ince been forgot|ten by his readers. You are not to learn, Sir John, that <HI>de non apparentibus &amp; non exi&s;tentibus cadem e&s;t ratio:</HI> and nothing but the active &s;pirit of literary jealou&s;y, could have dragged forth my former Ode from the ob&s;curity, in which it has long &s;lept, to the di&s;grace of all good ta&s;te in the pre&s;ent age.

<P>ON Sunday the 17th of the pre&s;ent month, to wit, July, Anno Domini, 1785, ju&s;t as his Maje&s;ty was a&s;cending the &s;tairs of his gallery, to attend divine wor&s;hip at WINDSOR, he was &s;urprized by the

appearance of a little thick, &s;quat, red-faced man, who in a very odd dre&s;s, and kneeling upon one knee, pre&s;ented a piece of paper for the Royal acceptation.

<Q>&startq;That the Petitioner, Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>, had been many years a maker of Poetry, as his friend Mr. <HI>Sadler</HI>, the pa&s;try-cook of Oxford, and &s;ome other creditable witne&s;&s;es could well evince; that many of his works of fancy, and more particularly that one, which is known by the name of his <HI>Critici&s;ms upon Milton</HI>, had been well received by the learned; that thus encouraged, he had entered the li&s;t, together with

many other great and re&s;pectable can|didates, for the honour of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the vacant <HI>Laureate&s;hip</HI>; that a de|cided return had been made in his favour by the officers be&s;t calculated to judge, namely, the Right Hon. the Earl of S&mdash; and the learned <HI>Signor Delpini</HI>, his Lord&s;hip's worthy co|adjutor; that the Signor's delicacy, unhappily for the Petitioner, like that of Mr. <HI>Corbett</HI>, in the in&s;tance of the We&s;tmin&s;ter election, had inclined him to the grant of a SCRUTINY; that in con&s;equence of the vexatious and per|tinacious per&s;everance on the part of &s;everal gentlemen in this illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ure, the Petitioner had been &s;everely injured in his &s;pirits, his comforts, and his intere&s;t: that he had been for many years engaged in a mo&s;t laborious and expen&s;ive under|taking, in which he had been honoured with the mo&s;t liberal communications from all the Univer&s;ities in Europe, to wit, a &s;plendid and mo&s;t correct edi|tion
