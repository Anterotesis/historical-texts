<HEAD>INTRODUCTION To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reign of Queen ANNE, (which, not|with&s;tanding tho&s;e happy Times which &s;uc|ceeded, every Engli&s;hman may remember) thou may'&s;t po&s;&s;ibly, gentle Reader, have &s;een a certain venerable Per&s;on who frequented the out|&s;ide of the Palace of St. James's, and who, by the Gravity of his Deportment and Habit, was gene|rally taken for a decay'd Gentleman of Spain. His &s;tature was tall, his vi&s;age long, his complexion olive, his brows were black and even, his eyes hollow yet piercing, his no&s;e inclin'd to aquiline, his beard neglected and mix'd with grey: All this contributed to &s;pread a &s;olemn Melancholy over his countenance. Pythagoras was not more &s;ilent, Pyrrho more motionle&s;s, nor Zeno more au&s;tere. His Wig was as black and &s;mooth as the plumes of a Raven, and hung as &s;trait as the hair of a River God ri&s;ing from the water. His Cloak &s;o com|pleatly covered his whole per&s;on, that whether or no he had any other cloaths (much le&s;s any lin|nen) under it, I &s;hall not &s;ay; but his &s;word ap|pear'd a full yard behind him, and his manner of
<PB N="106" REF="112">
wearing it was &s;o &s;tiff, that it &s;eem'd grown to his Thigh. His whole figure was &s;o utterly unlike any thing of this world, that it was not natural for any man to a&s;k him a que&s;tion without ble&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf fir&s;t. Tho&s;e who never &s;aw a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> took him for one, and others believed him &s;ome <HI>High Prie&s;t of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But under this macerated form was conceal'd a Mind replete with Science, burning with a zeal of benefiting his fellow-creatures, and filled with an hone&s;t con&s;cious pride, mixt with a &s;corn of doing, or &s;uffering the lea&s;t thing beneath the dig|nity of a Philo&s;opher. Accordingly he had a &s;oul that would not let him accept of any offers of Charity, at the &s;ame time that his body &s;eem'd but too much to require it. His lodging was in a &s;mall chamber up four pair of &s;tairs, where he re|gularly payed for what he had when he eat or drank; and he was often ob&s;erved wholly to ab|&s;tain from both. He declined &s;peaking to any one, except the Queen, or her fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, to whom he attempted to make &s;ome applications; but his real bu&s;ine&s;s or intentions were utterly unknown to all men. Thus much is certain, that he was ob|noxious to the Queen's Mini&s;try; who, either out of Jealou&s;y or Envy, had him &s;pirited away, and carried abroad as a dangerous per&s;on, without any regard to the known Laws of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>One day, as this Gentleman was walking about dinner-time alone in the Mall, it happened that a
<PB N="107" REF="113">
Manu&s;cript dropt from under his cloak, which my &s;ervant pick'd up, and brought to me. It was written in the Latin tongue, and contain'd many mo&s;t profound &s;ecrets, in an unu&s;ual turn of rea|&s;oning and &s;tyle. The fir&s;t leaf was in&s;cribed with the&s;e words, <HI>Codicillus, &s;eu Liber Memorialis, Mar|tini Scribleri.</HI> The Book was of &s;o wonderful a nature, that it is incredible what a de&s;ire I con|ceived that moment to be acquainted with the Author, who I clearly perceived was &s;ome great Philo&s;opher in di&s;gui&s;e. I &s;everal times endea|voured to &s;peak to him, which he as often in|du&s;triou&s;ly avoided. At length I found an oppor|tunity (as he &s;tood under the Piazza by the Danc|ing-room in St. James's) to acquaint him in the Latin tongue, that his Manu&s;cript was fallen into my hands; and &s;aying this, I pre&s;ented it to him, with great Encomiums on the learned Author. Hereupon he took me a&s;ide, &s;urvey'd me over with a fixt attention, and opening the cla&s;ps of the Parchment cover, &s;poke (to my great &s;urprize) in Engli&s;h, as follows:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Courteous &s;tranger, whoever thou art, I em|brace thee as my be&s;t friend; for either the Stars and my Art are deceitful, or the de&s;tin'd time is come which is to manife&s;t Martinus Scriblerus to the world, and thou the per&s;on cho&s;en by fate for this ta&s;k. What thou &s;ee&s;t in me is a body ex|hau&s;ted by the labours of the mind. I have
<PB N="108" REF="114">
found in Dame Nature not indeed an unkind, but a very coy Mi&s;tre&s;s: Watchful nights, anxi|ous days, &s;lender meals, and endle&s;s labours, mu&s;t be the lot of all who pur&s;ue her, through her labyrinths and maeanders. My fir&s;t vital air I drew in this I&s;land (a &s;oil fruitful of Philo&s;o|phers) but my complexion is become adu&s;t, and my body arid, by vi&s;iting lands (as the Poet has it) <HI>alio &s;ub &s;ole calentes.</HI> I have, through my whole life, pa&s;&s;ed under &s;everal di&s;gui&s;es and un|known names, to &s;kreen my&s;elf from the envy and malice which mankind expre&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Arcanum Magnum.</HI> But at pre&s;ent I am forced to take Sanctuary in the Briti&s;h Court, to avoid the Revenge of a cruel Spaniard, who has pur&s;ued me almo&s;t through the whole terraqueous globe. Being about four years ago in the City of Madrid in que&s;t of natu|ral knowledge, I was informed of a Lady who was marked with a Pomegranate upon the in|&s;ide of her right Thigh, which blo&s;&s;om'd, and, as it were, &s;eem'd to ripen in the due &s;ea&s;on. Forthwith was I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an in&s;atiable cu|rio&s;ity to view this wonderful Phaenomenon. I felt the ardour of my pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;e as the &s;ea|&s;on advanced, till, in the month of July, I could no longer contain. I bribed her Duenna, was admitted to the Bath, &s;aw her undre&s;s'd, and the wonder di&s;played. This was &s;oon after di&s;|covered by the hu&s;band, who finding &s;ome let|ters
<PB N="109" REF="115">
I had writ to the Duenna, containing ex|pre&s;&s;ions of a doubtful meaning, &s;u&s;pected me of a crime mo&s;t alien from the Purity of my Thoughts. Incontinently I left Madrid by the advice of friends, have been pur&s;ued, dogg'd, and way-laid through &s;everal Nations, and even now &s;carce think my&s;elf &s;ecure within the &s;acred walls of this Palace. It has been my good for|tune to have &s;een all the grand Phaenomena of Nature, excepting an Earthquake, which I wait|ed for in Naples three years in vain; and now by means of &s;ome Briti&s;h Ship (who&s;e Colours no Spaniard dares approach <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This marks the time when the Introduction was written.</NOTE>) I impatiently expect a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to Jamaica, for that benefit. To thee, my Friend, whom Fate has marked for my Hi&s;toriographer, I leave the&s;e my Commenta|ries, and others of my works. No more&mdash;be faithful and impartial.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>He &s;oon after performed his promi&s;e, and left me the Commentaries, giving me al&s;o further lights by many Conferences; when he was unfortunate|ly &s;natched away (as I before related) by the jea|lou&s;y of the Queen's Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Tho' I was thus to my eternal grief deprived of his conver&s;ation, he for &s;ome years continued his Corre&s;pondence, and communicated to me many of his Projects for the benefit of mankind. He &s;ent me &s;ome of his Writings, and recommended
<PB N="110" REF="116">
to my care the recovery of others, &s;tragling about the world, and a&s;&s;umed by other men. The la&s;t time I heard from him was on occa&s;ion of his Stri|ctures on the Dunciad: &s;ince when, &s;everal years being elap&s;ed, I have rea&s;on to believe this excel|lent per&s;on is either dead, or carried by his vehe|ment thir&s;t of knowledge into &s;ome remote, or perhaps undi&s;covered Region of the world. In ei|ther ca&s;e, I think it a debt no longer to be delay|ed, to reveal what I know of this Prodigy of Science, and to give the Hi&s;tory of his life, and of his exten&s;ive merits to mankind; in which I dare promi&s;e the Reader, that, whenever he begins to think any one Chapter dull, the &s;tyle will be im|mediately changed in the next.</P>

<P>Of the Parentage and Family of Scriblerus, how he was begot, what Care was taken of him before he was born, and what Prodigies attended his Birth.</P>
<P>IN the City of Mun&s;ter in Germany, lived a grave and learned Gentleman, by Profe&s;&s;ion an Antiquary; who, among all his invaluable Cu|rio&s;ities, e&s;teemed none more highly, than a Skin of the true Pergamenian Parchment, which hung at the upper-end of his hall. On this was curi|ou&s;ly

<P>His wife was a Lady of &s;ingular beauty, whom not for that rea&s;on only he e&s;pou&s;ed, but becau&s;e &s;he was undoubted daughter either of the great Scriverius, or of Ga&s;par Barthius. It happened on a time, the &s;aid Ga&s;par made a vi&s;it to Scrive|rius at Harlem, taking with him a comely Lady
<PB N="113" REF="119">
of his acquaintance, who was &s;kilful in the Greek Tongue, of whom the learned Scriverius became &s;o enamoured, as to inebriate his friend, and be fa|miliar with his Mi&s;tre&s;s. I am not ignorant of what <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Colume&s;ius relates this from I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius, in his Opu&s;cul. p. 102. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>Colume&s;ius affirms, that the learned Bar|thius was not &s;o overtaken, but he perceived it; and in Revenge &s;uffered this unfortunate Gentle|woman to be drowned in the Rhine at her return. But Mrs. Scriblerus (the i&s;&s;ue of that Amour) was a living proof of the fal&s;ehood of this Report. Dr. Cornelius was farther induced to his marriage, from the certain information that the afore&s;aid Lady, the mother of his wife, was related to Car|dan on the father's &s;ide, and to Aldrovandus on the mother's: Be&s;ides which, her Ance&s;tors had been profe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ick, A&s;trology, or Che|mi&s;try, in German Univer&s;ities, from generation to generation.</P>
<P>With this fair Gentlewoman had our Doctor lived in a comfortable Union for about ten years: But this our &s;ober and orderly pair, without any natural infirmity, and with a con&s;tant and frequent compliance to the chief duty of conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that Heaven had not ble&s;&s;ed them with any i&s;&s;ue. This was the utmo&s;t grief to the good man; e&s;pecially con&s;idering what exact Pre|cautions and Methods he had u&s;ed to procure that Ble&s;&s;ing: for he never had cohabitation with his

&s;pou&s;e, but he pondered on the Rules of the An|cients, for the generation of Children of Wit. He ordered his diet according to the pre&s;cription of Galen, confining him&s;elf and his wife for almo&s;t the whole fir&s;t year to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Galen Lib. de Cibis boni et mali &s;ucci, cap. 3.

It unfortunately befel her, when &s;he was about four months gone with child, to long for &s;ome|what, which that author inveighs again&s;t as preju|dicial to the under&s;tanding of the infant. This her hu&s;band thought fit to deny her, affirming, it was better to be childle&s;s, than to become the Parent of a Fool.

<P>Under the&s;e regulations, his wife, to his unex|pre&s;&s;ible joy, grew pregnant a &s;econd time; and, (what was no &s;mall addition to his happine&s;s) he ju&s;t then came to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable E&s;tate by the death of her Uncle, a wealthy Jew who re&s;ided at London. This made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to take a journey to England; nor would the care of his po&s;terity let him &s;uffer his Wife to remain behind him. During the voyage, he was perpetually taken up on the one hand, how to employ his great Riches; and on the other, how to educate his Child. He had already determined to &s;et apart &s;everal annual Sums, for the recovery of <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> the effo&s;&s;ion of <HI>Coins,</HI> the procur|ing of <HI>Mummies;</HI> and for all tho&s;e curious di&s;co|veries by which he hoped to become (as him&s;elf was wont to &s;ay) a &s;econd <HI>Peire&s;kius</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">There was a great deal of trifling pedantry and curio&s;ity in that great Man's character.</NOTE>.

<P>The Truth of this, and every preceding Fact, may be depended upon, being taken literally from the Memoirs. But I mu&s;t be &s;o ingenuous as to own, that the Accounts are not &s;o certain of the exact time and place of his birth. As to the fir&s;t, he had the common frailty of old men, to conceal his age: as to the &s;econd, I only remember to have heard him &s;ay, that he fir&s;t &s;aw the light in St. Giles's Pari&s;h. But in the inve&s;tigation of this point, For|tune hath favoured our diligence. For one day as I was pa&s;&s;ing by the <HI>Seven Dials,</HI> I overheard a di&s;pute concerning the place of Nativity of a great A&s;trologer, which each man alledged to have been in his own &s;treet. The circum&s;tances of the time, and
<PB N="117" REF="123">
the de&s;cription the per&s;on, made me imagine it might be that univer&s;al Genius who&s;e life I am writing. I returned home, and having maturely con&s;idered their &s;everal arguments, which I found to be of equal weight, I quieted my curio&s;ity with this natural conclu&s;ion, that he was born in &s;ome point common to all the &s;even &s;treets; which mu&s;t be that on which the column is now erected. And it is with infinite plea&s;ure that I &s;ince find my Con|jecture confirmed, by the following pa&s;&s;age in the Codicil to Mr. Neale's Will.</P>

<P>But what was of all mo&s;t wonderful, was a thing that &s;eemed a mon&s;trous <HI>Fowl,</HI> which ju&s;t then dropt through the &s;ky-light, near his wife's apartment. It had a large body, two little di&s;pro|portioned wings, a prodigious tail, but no head. As its colour was white, he took it at fir&s;t &s;ight for a Swan, and was concluding his &s;on would be a Poet: but on a nearer view, he perceived it to be &s;peckled with black, in the form of letters; and that it was indeed a Paper kite which had broke its lea&s;h by the impetuo&s;ity of the wind. His back was armed with the Art Military, his belly was filled with Phy&s;ick, his wings were the wings of Quarles and Withers, the &s;everal Nodes of his voluminous tail were diver&s;ify'd with &s;everal branches of Science; where the Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of Logick, a knot of Meta|phy&s;ick, a knot of Ca&s;ui&s;try, a knot of Polemical

<P>There went a Report in the family, that, as &s;oon as he was born, he uttered the voice of nine &s;eve|ral animals: he cry'd like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep, chattered like a Mag-pye, grunted like a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gabbled like a Goo&s;e, and bray'd like an A&s;s. And the next morning he was found playing in his bed with two Owls, which came down the chimney. His Father greatly re|joiced at all the&s;e &s;igns, which betokened the va|riety of his Eloquence, and the extent of his Learn|ing; but he was more particularly plea&s;ed with the la&s;t, as it nearly re&s;embled what happen'd at the birth of Homer <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>NO &s;ooner was the cry of the Infant heard, but the old gentleman ru&s;hed into the room, and &s;natching it in his arms, examined every limb with attention. He was infinitely plea&s;ed to find,
<PB N="120" REF="126">
that the Child had the Wart of Cicero, the wry neck of Alexander, knots upon his legs like Ma|rius, and one of them &s;horter than the other like Age&s;ilaus. The good Cornelius al&s;o hoped he would come to &s;tammer like Demo&s;thenes, in or|der to be as eloquent; and in time arrive at many other defects of famous men. He held the child &s;o long, that the Midwife, grown out of all pati|ence, &s;natched it from his arms, in order to &s;wad|dle it. <Q>&startq;Swaddle him!

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing what befel the Doctor's Son and his Shield, on the Day of the Chri&s;t'|ning.</HEAD>
<P>THE day of the Chri&s;t'ning being come, and the hou&s;e filled with Go&s;&s;ips, the Levity of who&s;e Conver&s;ation &s;uited but ill with the Gra|vity of Dr. Cornelius, he ca&s;t about how to pa&s;s this day more agreeably to his Character; that is to &s;ay, not without &s;ome <HI>Profitable Conference,</HI> nor wholly without ob&s;ervance of &s;ome <HI>Ancient Cu|&s;tom.</HI></P>
<P>He remembered to have read in Theocritus, that the Cradle of Hercules was a Shield; and being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of an antique <HI>Buckler</HI> which he held as a mo&s;t ine&s;timable Relick, he determined to have the infant laid therein, and in that manner brought into the Study, to be &s;hown to certain learned men of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>The regard he had for this Shield, had cau&s;ed him formerly to compile a Di&s;&s;ertation concern|ing it <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See the Di&s;&s;ertation on Dr. Woodward's Shield&punc;</NOTE>, proving from the &s;everal properties, and particularly the colour of the Ru&s;t, the exact chronology thereof.</P>
<P>With this Treati&s;e, and a moderate &s;upper, he propo&s;ed to entertain his Gue&s;ts; tho' he had al&s;o
<PB N="124" REF="130">
another de&s;ign, to have their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the cal|culation of his Son's <HI>Nativity.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore took the Buckler out of a Ca&s;e (in which he always kept it, le&s;t it might contract any modern ru&s;t) and entru&s;ted it to his Hou&s;e|maid, with orders, that when the company was come &s;he &s;hould lay the Child carefully in it, co|ver'd with a mantle of blue Sattin.</P>
<P>The Gue&s;ts were no &s;ooner &s;eated, but they entered into a warm Debate about the <HI>Triclinium</HI> and the manner of <HI>Decubitus</HI> of the Ancients, which Cornelius broke off in this manner:</P>
<Q>&startq;This day, my Friends, I purpo&s;e to exhibit my &s;on before you; a Child not wholly unwor|thy of In&s;pection, as he is de&s;cended from a Race of Virtuo&s;i. Let the Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts exa|mine his features; let the Chirographi&s;ts behold his Palm; but above all let us con&s;ult for the calculation of his Nativity. To this end, as the child is not vulgar, I will not pre&s;ent him unto you in a vulgar manner. He &s;hall be cradled in my Ancient Shield, &s;o famous through the Univer|&s;ities of Europe. You all know how I pur|cha&s;ed that invaluable piece of Antiquity at the great (though indeed inadequate) expence of all the Plate of our family, how happily I carried it off, and how triumphantly I tran&s;ported it hi|ther, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of all Germany. Happy in every circum&s;tance, but that it broke the heart of the great Melchior In&s;ipidus!&endq;</Q>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131">
Here he &s;topp'd his Speech, upon &s;ight of the Maid, who enter'd the room with the Child: He took it in his arms and proceeded:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Behold then my Child, but fir&s;t behold the Shield: Behold this Ru&s;t,&mdash;or rather let me call it this precious Aerugo,&mdash;behold this beautiful Varni&s;h of Time,&mdash;this venerable Verdure of &s;o many Ages&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>In &s;peaking the&s;e words, he &s;lowly lifted up the Mantle, which covered it, inch by inch; but at every inch he uncovered, his cheeks grew paler, his hand trembled, his nerves failed, till on &s;ight of the whole, the Tremor became univer&s;al: The Shield and the Infant both dropt to the ground, and he had only &s;trength enough to cry out, <Q>&startq;O God! my Shield, my Shield!&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Truth was, the Maid (extremely con|cern'd for the reputation of her own cleanline&s;s, and her young ma&s;ter's honour) had &s;coured it as clean as her Andirons <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Poor Vadius, long with learned &s;pleen devour'd,</L>

<P>Cornelius &s;unk back on a chair, the Gue&s;ts &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, the infant &s;quaul'd, the maid ran in, &s;natch'd it up again in her arms, flew into her mi&s;tre&s;s's room, and told what had happen'd. Down &s;tairs in an in&s;tant hurried all the Go&s;&s;ips, where they found the Doctor in a Trance: Hun|gary water, Hart&s;horn, and the confu&s;ed noi&s;e of &s;hrill voices, at length awaken'd him: when open|ing
<PB N="126" REF="132">
his eyes, he &s;aw the Shield in the hands of the Hou&s;e-maid. <Q>&startq;O Woman! Woman! he cry'd (and &s;natch'd it violently from her) was it to thy ignorance that this Relick owes its ruin? where, where is the beautiful Cru&s;t that cover|ed thee &s;o long? where tho&s;e Traces of Time, and <HI>Fingers</HI> as it were of Antiquity? Where all tho&s;e beautiful ob&s;curities, the cau&s;e of much delightful di&s;putation, where doubt and curio|&s;ity went hand in hand, and eternally exerci&s;ed the &s;peculations of the learned? All this the rude Touch of an ignorant woman hath done away! The <HI>curious Prominence</HI> at the belly of that figure, which &s;ome taking for the <HI>Cu&s;pis</HI> of a &s;word, denominated a Roman Soldier; others account|ing the <HI>In&s;ignia Virilia,</HI> pronounced to be one of the <HI>Dii Termini;</HI> behold &s;he hath cleaned it in like &s;hameful &s;ort, and &s;hewn to be the head of a Nail.

<P>The Go&s;&s;ips, not at all inquiring into the cau&s;e of his &s;orrow, only a&s;ked if the Child had no hurt? and cry'd, <Q>&startq;Come, come, all is well; what has the woman done but her duty? a tight cleanly wench I warrant her; what a &s;tir a man makes about a <HI>Ba&s;on,</HI> that an hour ago, before this la|bour was be&s;towed upon it, a Country Barber would not have hung at his &s;hop door.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Suction and Nutrition of the Great Scriblerus in his Infancy, and of the fir&s;t Rudiments of his Learning.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Cornelius awaked, he rai&s;ed him|&s;elf on his elbow, and ca&s;ting his eye on Mrs. Scriblerus, &s;poke as follows. <Q>&startq;Wi&s;ely was it &s;aid by Homer, that in the Cellar of Jupiter are two barrels, the one of good, the other of evil, which he never be&s;tows on mortals &s;epa|rately, but con&s;tantly mingles them together. Thus at the &s;ame time hath Heav'n ble&s;&s;ed me with the birth of a Son, and afflicted me with the &s;couring of my Shield. Yet let us not re|pine
<PB N="128" REF="134">
at his Di&s;pen&s;ations, who gives, and who takes away; but rather join in prayer, that the Ru&s;t of Antiquity which he hath been plea&s;ed to take from my Shield, may be added to my Son; and that &s;o much of it, as it is my pur|po&s;e he &s;hall contract in his Education, may never be de&s;troy'd by any Modern Poli&s;hing.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>He could no longer bear the &s;ight of the Shield, but ordered it &s;hould be removed for ever from his eyes. It was not long after purchas'd by Dr. Woodward, who, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Kemp&punc; incru&s;ted it with a new Ru&s;t, and is the &s;ame whereof a Cut hath been engraved, and exhibited to the great Contentation of the learned.</P>
<P>Cornelius now began to regulate the Suction of his child. Seldom did there pa&s;s a day withou$ di&s;putes between him and the Mother, or the Nur&s;e, concerning the nature of Aliment. The poor woman never dined but he denied her &s;ome di&s;h or other, which he judged prejudicial to her milk. One day &s;he had a longing de&s;ire to a piece of beef, and as &s;he &s;tretch'd her hand towards it, the old gentleman drew it away, and &s;poke to this effect. <Q>&startq;Had'&s;t thou read the Ancients, O Nur&s;e, thou would'&s;t prefer the welfare of the Infant which thou nouri&s;he&s;t, to the indulging of a$ irregular and voracious Appetite. Beef, it is true, may confer a Robu&s;tne&s;s on the limbs of my &s;on, but will hebetate and clogg his Intel|lectuals.&endq;</Q> While he &s;poke this, the Nur&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="135">
looked upon him with much anger, and now and then ca&s;t a wi&s;hful eye upon the Beef&mdash;<Q>&startq;Pa&s;&s;ion (continued the Doctor, &s;till holding the di&s;h) throws the mind into too violent a fermentation; it is a kind of Fever of the &s;oul, or, as Horace expre&s;&s;es it&punc; a <HI>Short Madne&s;s.</HI> Con&s;ider, Wo|man, that this day's Suction of my &s;on may cau&s;e him to imbibe many ungovernable Pa&s;&s;ions, and in a manner &s;poil him for the temper of a Phi|lo&s;opher. Romulus by &s;ucking a Wolf, be|came of a fierce and &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition; and were I to breed &s;ome Ottoman Emperor, or Founder of a Military Commonwealth, perhaps I might indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite.&endq;</Q>&mdash;What, interrupted the Nur&s;e, Beef &s;poil the un|der&s;tanding? that's fine indeed&mdash;how then could our Par&s;on preach as he does upon Beef, and Pud|ding too, if you go to that? Don't tell me of your Ancients, had not you almo&s;t killed the poor babe with a di&s;h of Daemonial black Broth?&mdash;<Q>&startq;Lace|daemonian black Broth, thou would'&s;t &s;ay, (re|plied Cornelius) but I cannot allow the &s;urfeit to have been occa&s;ioned by that diet, &s;ince it was recommended by the Divine Lycurgus. No&punc; Nur&s;e, thou mu&s;t certainly have eaten &s;ome meats of ill dige&s;tion the day before, and that was the real cau&s;e of his di&s;order. Con&s;ider, Woman, the different Temperaments of diffe|rent Nations: What makes the Engli&s;h Phleg|matick and melancholy, but Beef? what renders
<PB N="130" REF="136">
the Wel&s;h &s;o hot and cholerick, but Chee&s;e and Leeks? the French derive their levity from their Soups, Frogs, and Mu&s;hrooms: I would not let my Son dine like an Italian, left like an Ita|lian he &s;hould be jealous and revengeful: The warm and &s;olid diet of Spain may be more be|neficial, as it might indue him with a profund Gravity, but at the &s;ame time he might &s;uck in with their food their intolerable Vice of Pride. Therefore, Nur&s;e, in &s;hort, I hold it requi&s;ite to deny you at pre&s;ent, not only Beef, but like|wi&s;e what&s;oever any of tho&s;e Nations eat.&endq;</Q> Du|ring this &s;peech, the Nur&s;e remain'd pouting and marking her plate with the knife, nor would &s;he touch a bit during the whole dinner. This the old Gentleman ob&s;erving, ordered that the Child, to avoid the ri&s;que of imbibing ill humours, &s;hould be kept from her brea&s;t all that day, and be fed with Butter, mix'd with Honey, according to a Pre&s;cription he had met with &s;omewhere in Eu|&s;tathius upon Homer. This indeed gave the Child a great loo&s;ene&s;s, but he was not concerned at it, in the opinion that whatever harm it might do his body, would be amply recompenced by the im|provements of his under&s;tanding. But from thence|forth he in&s;i&s;ted every day upon a particular Diet to be ob&s;erved by the Nur&s;e; under which having been long unea&s;y, &s;he at la&s;t parted from the fa|mily, on his ordering her for dinner the <HI>Paps</HI> of

<P>Four years of young Martin's life pa&s;&s;ed away in &s;quabbles of this nature. Mrs. Scriblerus con|&s;idered it was now time to in&s;truct him in the &s;un|damentals of Religion, and to that end took no &s;mall pains in teaching him his <HI>Catechi&s;m.</HI> But Cornelius looked upon this as a tedious way of In|&s;truction, and therefore employed his head to find out more plea&s;ing methods, the better to induce him to be fond of learning. He would frequent|ly carry him to the <HI>Puppet-&s;how,</HI> of the Creation of the world, where the Child with exceeding de|light gained a notion of the Hi&s;tory of the Bible. His fir&s;t rudiments in prophane hi&s;tory were ac|quired by &s;eeing of <HI>Raree-&s;hows,</HI> where he was brought acquainted with all the Princes of Europe. In &s;hort, the old Gentleman &s;o contrived it, to make every thing contribute to the improvement of his knowledge, even to his very Dre&s;s. He in|vented for him a Geographical &s;uit of cloaths, which might give him &s;ome hints of that Science, and likewi&s;e &s;ome knowledge of the Commerce of different Nations.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Di&s;&s;ertation upon Play-things.</HEAD>
<P>HERE follow the In&s;tructions of Cornelius Scriblerus concerning the Plays and Play|things to be u&s;ed by his &s;on Martin.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Play</HI> was invented by the <HI>Lydians</HI> as a reme|dy again&s;t <HI>Hunger.</HI> Sophocles &s;ays of Palamedes, that he invented <HI>Dice</HI> to &s;erve &s;ometimes in&s;tead of a dinner. It is therefore wi&s;ely contrived by Nature, that Children, as they have the keene&s;t <HI>Appetites,</HI> are mo&s;t addicted to <HI>Plays.</HI> From the &s;ame cau&s;e, and from the unprejudic'd and incorrupt &s;implicity of their minds it pro|ceeds, that the Plays of the Ancient Children are pre&s;erved more entire than any other of their Cu&s;toms <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dr. Arbuthnot u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>Men</HI> might talk what they plea&s;ed of the &s;afe conveyance of <HI>Tradition;</HI> but it was no where pre&s;erved pure and uncorrupt but among&s;t Children, who&s;e Cu&s;toms and Plays, he ob&s;erved, were delivered down in|variably from one generation to another.</NOTE>. In this matter I would recommend
<PB N="135" REF="141">
to all who have any concern in my Son's Edu|cation, that they deviate not in the lea&s;t from the primitive and &s;imple Antiquity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;To &s;peak fir&s;t of the <HI>Whi&s;tle,</HI> as it is the fir&s;t of all Play-things. I will have it exactly to corre&s;pond with the ancient <HI>Fi&s;tula,</HI> and accord|ingly to be compo&s;ed <HI>&s;eptem paribus disjuncta cicutis.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I heartily wi&s;h a diligent &s;earch may be made after the true <HI>Crepitaculum,</HI> or <HI>Rattle</HI> of the An|cients, for that (as <HI>Archytas Tarentinus</HI> was of opinion) kept the children from breaking Earth|ern Ware. The <HI>China</HI> cups in the&s;e days are not at all the &s;afer for the modern <HI>Rattles;</HI> which is an evident proof how far their <HI>Crepitacula</HI> ex|ceeded ours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I would not have Martin as yet to &s;courge a <HI>Top,</HI> till I am better informed whether the <HI>Tro|chus</HI> which was recommended by <HI>Cato</HI> be really our pre&s;ent <HI>Top,</HI> or rather the <HI>Hoop</HI> which the boys drive with a &s;tick. Neither <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> and <HI>Pile,</HI> nor <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Drakes</HI> are quite &s;o ancient as <HI>Handy-dandy,</HI> tho' Macrobius and St. Augu&s;tine take notice of the fir&s;t, and Minutius Foelix, de|&s;cribes the latter; but <HI>Handy-dandy</HI> is mention'd by Ari&s;totle, Plato, and Ari&s;tophanes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The Play which the Italians call <HI>Cinque,</HI> and the French <HI>Mourre,</HI> is extremely ancient; it was played at by <HI>Hymen</HI> and <HI>Cupid</HI> at the Mar|riage
<PB N="136" REF="142">
of <HI>P&s;ych&eacute;,</HI> and term'd by the Latins, <HI>di|gitis micare.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Julius Pollux de&s;cribes the <HI>Omilla</HI> or <HI>Chuck-farthing:</HI> tho' &s;ome will have our modern <HI>Chuck-farthing</HI> to be nearer the <HI>Aphetinda</HI> of the Ancients. He al&s;o mentions the <HI>Ba&s;ilinda,</HI> or <HI>King I am;</HI> and <HI>Myinda,</HI> or <HI>Hoopers-Hide.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But the <HI>Chytrindra</HI> de&s;cribed by the &s;ame Au|thor is certainly not our <HI>Hot-cockle;</HI> for that was by pinching and not by &s;triking; tho' there are good authors who affirm the <HI>Rathapygi&s;mus</HI> to be yet nearer the modern <HI>Hot-cockles.</HI> My &s;on Martin may u&s;e either of them indifferently, they being equally antique.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Building of Hou&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Riding upon Sticks</HI> have been u&s;ed by children in all ages, <HI>Aedificare ca&s;as, equitare in arundine longa.</HI> Yet I much doubt whether the Riding upon Sticks did not come into u&s;e after the age of the <HI>Centaurs.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There is one Play which &s;hews the gravity of ancient Education, called the <HI>Acinetinda,</HI> in which children contended who could longe&s;t <HI>&s;tand &s;till.</HI> This we have &s;uffer'd to peri&s;h en|tirely; and, if I might be allowed to gue&s;s, it was certainly fir&s;t lo&s;t among the <HI>French.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I will permit my Son to play at <HI>Apodida&s;|cinda,</HI> which can be no other than our <HI>Pu&s;s in a Corner.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Julius Pollux in his ninth book &s;peaks of the <HI>Melolonthe</HI> or the <HI>Kite;</HI> but I que&s;tion whether
<PB N="137" REF="143">
the Kite of Antiquity was the &s;ame with ours: And though the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>Quail-fighting</HI> is what is mo&s;t taken notice of, they had doubt|le&s;s <HI>Cock-matches</HI> al&s;o, as is evident from certain ancient Gems and Relievo's.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;In a word, let my &s;on Martin di&s;port him&s;elf at any Game truly Antique, except one, which was invented by a people among the Thracians, who hung up one of their Companions in a Rope, and gave him a Knife to cut him&s;elf down; which if he failed in, he was &s;uffered to hang till he was dead; and this was only rec|koned a &s;ort of joke. I am utterly again&s;t this, as barbarous and cruel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I cannot conclude, without taking notice of the beauty of the <HI>Greek</HI> names, who&s;e Etymolo|gies acquaint us with the nature of the &s;ports; and how infinitely, both in &s;en&s;e and &s;ound, they excel our barbarous names of Plays.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the foregoing Injunctions of Dr. Cornelius, he yet conde&s;cended to allow the Child the u&s;e of &s;ome few modern Play-things; &s;uch as might prove of any benefit to his mind, by in&s;tilling an early notion of the &s;ciences. For ex|ample, he found that <HI>Marbles</HI> taught him <HI>Percu&s;|&s;ion</HI> and the <HI>Laws of Motion; Nut-crackers</HI> the u&s;e of the <HI>Leaver; Swinging</HI> on the ends of a Board, the <HI>Balance; Bottle-&s;crews,</HI> the <HI>Vice; Whir|ligigs</HI> the <HI>Axis</HI> and <HI>Peritrochia; Bird-cages,</HI> the <HI>Pully;</HI> and <HI>Tops</HI> the <HI>Centrifrugal</HI> motion.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e, he taught him as a diver&s;ion, an odd and &s;ecret manner of <HI>Stealing,</HI> according to the Cu&s;tom of the Lacedaemonians; wherein he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he practi&s;ed it to the day of his death.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Gymna&s;ticks, in what Exerci&s;es Martinus was educated; &s;omething concerning Mu&s;ick, and what &s;ort of a Man his Uncle was.</HEAD>
<P>NOR was Cornelius le&s;s careful in adhering to the rules of the pure&s;t Antiquity, in re|lation to the <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of his Son. He was &s;tript, powder'd, and anointed, but not con&s;tantly bath'd, which occa&s;ioned many heavy complaints of the Laundre&s;s about dirtying his linen. When he played at Quoits, he was allowed his Breeches and Stockings; becau&s;e the <HI>Di&s;coboli</HI> (as Cornelius
<PB N="139" REF="145">
well knew) were naked to the middle only. The Mother often contended for modern Sports, and common Cu&s;toms, but this was his con&s;tant re|ply, <Q>&startq;Let a Daughter be the care of her Mother, but the Education of a Son &s;hould be the delight of his Father.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It was about this time, he heard, to his exceed|ing content, that the <HI>Harpa&s;tus</HI> of the Ancients was yet in u&s;e in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and known there by the name of <HI>Hurling.</HI> He was &s;en&s;ible the com|mon <HI>Foot-ball</HI> was a very imperfect imitation of that exerci&s;e; and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end Martin into the We&s;t, to be initiated in that truly ancient and manly part of the <HI>Gymna&s;ticks.</HI> The poor boy was &s;o unfortunate as to return with a broken leg. This Cornelius looked upon but as a &s;light ailment, and promi&s;ed his Mother he would in&s;tantly cure it: He &s;lit a green Reed, and ca&s;t the Knife upward, then tying the two parts of the Reed to the disjointed place, pronounced the&s;e words <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.

<P>Albertus was a di&s;creet man, &s;ober in his opi|nions, clear of Pedantry, and knowing enough both in Books and in the World, to pre&s;erve a due regard for whatever was u&s;eful or excellent, whe|ther ancient or modern: If he had not always the authority, he had at lea&s;t the art, to divert Cor|nelius from many extravagancies. It was well he came &s;peedily, or Martin could not have boa&s;ted the entire Quota of his Vi&s;cera. <Q>&startq;&endq;What does it &s;ignify (quoth Albertus) whether my Nephew excels in the <HI>Cur&s;us</HI> or not? Speed is often a &s;ymptom of Cowardice, witne&s;s Hares and Deer.&mdash;Do not forget Achilles (quoth Cor|nelius) I know that Running has been condemn|ed by the proud Spartans, as u&s;ele&s;s in war; and yet Demo&s;thenes could &s;ay, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; a thought which the Engli&s;h Hudi|bras has well rendered,</Q>

<P>COrnelius having (as hath been &s;aid) many ways been di&s;appointed in his attempts of improving the bodily Forces of his &s;on, thought it now high time to apply to the Culture of his Internal faculties. He judged it proper in the first place to in&s;truct him in <HI>Rhetorick.</HI> But herein we &s;hall not need to give the Reader any account of his wonderful progre&s;s, &s;ince it is already known to the earned world by his Treati&s;e on this &s;ubject: I mean the admirable Di&s;cour&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which $e wrote at this time, but conceal'd from his Fa|$her, knowing his extreme partiality for the An|$ents. It lay by him concealed, and perhaps for|$ot among the great multiplicity of other Writ|$gs, till, about the year 1727, he &s;ent it us to be $rinted, with many additional examples drawn $om the excellent live Poets of this pre&s;ent age. $e proceed therefore to <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Metaphy&s;icks.</HI></P>

The wi&s;e Cornelius was convinced, that the&s;e being <HI>Polemical</HI> Arts, could no more be learned alone, than Fencing or Cudgel-playing. He thought it therefore nece&s;&s;ary to look out for &s;ome Youth of pregnant parts, to be a &s;ort of humble Companion to his &s;on in tho&s;e &s;tudies. His good fortune directed him to one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular en|dowments, who&s;e name was Conradus Crambe, who by the father's &s;ide was related to the <HI>Crouches</HI> of Cambridge, and his mother was Cou&s;in to Mr. <HI>Swan,</HI> Game&s;ter and Pun&s;ter of the City of Lon|don. So that from both parents he drew a natu|ral di&s;po&s;ition to &s;port him&s;elf with <HI>Words,</HI> which as they are &s;aid to be the counters of wi&s;e Men, and ready-money of Fools, Crambe had great &s;tore of ca&s;h of the latter &s;ort. Happy Martin in &s;uch a Parent, and &s;uch a Companion! What might not he atchieve in Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t premi&s;e a general ob&s;ervation of great benefit to mankind. That there are many people who have the u&s;e only of one Operation of the Intellect, tho', like &s;hort-&s;ighted men, they can hardly di&s;cover it them&s;elves: They can form <HI>&s;in|gle apprehen&s;ions</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">When a learned Friend once urged to our Author the Au|thority of a famous Dictionary-maker again&s;t the latinity of the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>amor publicus,</HI> which he had u&s;ed in an in&s;cription, he replied, that he would allow a Dictionary-maker to under&s;tand a &s;ingle word, but not two words put together.</NOTE>, but have neither of the other two faculties, the <HI>judicium</HI> or <HI>di&s;cur&s;us.</HI> Now as it is wi&s;ely ordered, that people deprived of one
<PB N="149" REF="155">
&s;en&s;e have the others in more perfection, &s;uch peo|ple will form &s;ingle Ideas with a great deal of vi|vacity; and happy were it indeed if they would confine them&s;elves to &s;uch, without forming <HI>judi|cia,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>argumentations.</HI></P>
<P>Cornelius quickly di&s;covered, that the&s;e two la&s;t operations of the intellect were very weak in Mar|tin, and almo&s;t totally extingui&s;hed in Crambe; however he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that Rules of Logick are Spectacles to a purblind under&s;tanding, and there|fore he re&s;olved to proceed with his two Pupils.</P>
<P>Martin's under&s;tanding was &s;o totally immers'd in <HI>&s;en&s;ible objects,</HI> that he demanded examples from Material things of the ab&s;tracted Ideas of Logick: As for Crambe, he contented him&s;elf with the Words, and when he could but form &s;ome con|ceit upon them, was fully &s;atisfied. Thus Crambe would tell his In&s;tructor, that All men were not <HI>&s;ingular;</HI> that Individuality could hardly be prae|dicated of any man, for it was commonly &s;aid that a man <HI>is</HI> not the &s;ame he <HI>was,</HI> that madmen are <HI>be&s;ide them&s;elves,</HI> and drunken men <HI>come to them|&s;elves;</HI> which &s;hows, that few men have that mo&s;t valuable logical endowment, Individuality <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;But if it be po&s;&s;ible for the &s;ame man to have di&s;tinct in|communicable con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at different times, it is without doubt the &s;ame man would at different times make different per&s;ons. Which we &s;ee is the &s;en&s;e of mankind in not pu|ni&s;hing the mad man for the &s;ober man's actions, nor the &s;ober man for what the mad man did, thereby making them two per&s;ons; which is &s;omewhat explained by our way of &s;peaking in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when they &s;ay &s;uch an one <HI>is not him|&s;elf,</HI> or <HI>is be&s;ides him&s;elf.&endq;</HI></Q> <HI>Locke's E&s;&s;ay on Hum.

told Martin that a &s;houlder of mutton was an individual, which Crambe denied, for he had &s;een it cut into commons: That's true (quoth the Tutor) but you never &s;aw it cut into &s;houlders of mutton: If it could (quoth Crambe) it would be the mo&s;t lovely individual of the University. When he was told, a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> was that which was <HI>&s;ubject to accidents;</HI> then Soldiers (quoth Crambe) are the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial people in the world. Neither would he allow it to be a good definition of <HI>acci|dent,</HI> that it could be <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> or <HI>ab&s;ent without the de&s;truction of the &s;ubject;</HI> &s;ince there are a great many accidents that de&s;troy the &s;ubject, as burn|ing does a hou&s;e, and death a man. But as to that, Cornelius informed him, that there was a <HI>natural death,</HI> and a <HI>logical death;</HI> that though a man after his natural death was not capable of the lea&s;t pari&s;h-office, yet he might &s;till keep his Stall among&s;t the logical praedicaments.</P>
<P>Cornelius was forced to give Martin &s;en&s;ible images; thus calling up the Coachman he a&s;ked him what he had &s;een at the Bear-garden? the man an&s;wered, he &s;aw two men fight a prize; one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the Guards; the other black, a Butcher; the Sergeant had red Breeches, the Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage about four o'clock, and the Sergeant wound|ed
<PB N="151" REF="157">
the Butcher in the leg. <Q>&startq;Mark (quoth Cor|nelius) how the fellow runs through the praedi|caments. Men, <HI>&s;ub&s;tantia;</HI> two, <HI>quantitas;</HI> fair and black, <HI>qualitas;</HI> Sergeant and Butcher, <HI>relatio;</HI> wounded the other, <HI>actio &amp; pa&s;&s;io:</HI> &s;ighting, <HI>&s;itus;</HI> Stage, <HI>ubi;</HI> two a Clock, <HI>quando;</HI> blue and red Breeches, <HI>habitus.&endq;</HI></Q> At the &s;ame time he warn'd Martin, that what he now <HI>learn'd</HI> as a Logician, he mu&s;t <HI>forget</HI> as a natural Philo&s;o|pher; that tho' he now taught them that accidents inher'd in the &s;ubject, they would find in time there was no &s;uch thing; and that colour, ta&s;te, &s;mell, heat, and cold, were not in the things but only phanta&s;ms of our brains. He was forced to let them into this &s;ecret, for Martin could not con|ceive how a habit of dancing inher'd in a dancing|ma&s;ter, when he did not dance; nay, he would demand the Characteri&s;ticks of Relations: Crambe u&s;ed to help him out by telling him, a Cuckold, a lo&s;ing game&s;ter, a man that had not din'd, a young heir that was kept &s;hort by his father, might be all known by their countenance; that, in this la&s;t ca&s;e, the Paternity and Filiation leave very &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>relatum</HI> and <HI>correlatum.</HI> The greate&s;t difficulty was when they came to the Tenth praedicament: Crambe affirmed, that his habitus was more a &s;ub&s;tance than he was; for his cloaths could better &s;ub&s;i&s;t without him, than he without his cloaths.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158">
Martin &s;uppo&s;ed an <HI>Univer&s;al Man</HI> to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Burge&s;s of a Corporation, that repre&s;ented a great many Individuals. His Father a&s;k'd him, if he could not frame the Idea of an Univer&s;al Lord Mayor? Martin told him, that, never having &s;een but one Lord Mayor, the Idea of that Lord Mayor always returned to his mind; that he had great difficulty to ab&s;tract a Lord Mayor from his Fur, Gown, and Gold Chain; nay, that the hor&s;e he &s;aw the Lord Mayor ride upon not a little di&s;turbed his imagination. On the other hand Crambe, to &s;how him&s;elf of a more penetrating genius, &s;wore that he could frame a conception of a Lord Mayor not only without his Hor&s;e, Gown, and Gold Chain, but even without Stature, Feature, Colour, Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body; which he &s;uppo&s;ed was the ab&s;tract of a Lord Mayor <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This is not a fair repre&s;entation of what is &s;aid in the <HI>E&s;|&s;ay on Human Under&s;t.</HI> concerning <HI>general and ab&s;tract ideas.</HI> But &s;erious writers have done that Philo&s;opher the &s;ame inju&s;tice.</NOTE>Cornelius told him that he was a lying Ra&s;eal; that an <HI>Univer&s;ale</HI> was not the object of imagination, and that there was no &s;uch thing in reality, or a <HI>parte Rei.</HI> But I can prove (quoth Crambe) that there are <HI>Cly&s;ters a parte Rei,</HI> but <HI>Cly&s;ters</HI> are <HI>univer&s;ales; ergo.</HI> Thus I prove my Minor. <HI>Quod aptum e&s;t ine&s;&s;e multis,</HI> is an <HI>univer&s;ale</HI> by definition: but every cly&s;ter before it is admini&s;tred has that quality; therefore every cly&s;ter is an <HI>univer&s;ale.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="159">
He al&s;o found fault with the Adverti&s;ements, that they were not &s;trict logical <HI>definitions:</HI> In an adverti&s;ement of a Dog &s;tolen or &s;trayed, he &s;aid it ought to begin thus, <HI>An irrational animal</HI> of the <HI>Genus caninum,</HI> &amp;c. Cornelius told them, that tho' tho&s;e adverti&s;ements were not framed according to the exact rules of logical definitions, being only <HI>de&s;criptions</HI> of things <HI>numero differentibus,</HI> yet they contained a faint image of the <HI>praedicabilia,</HI> and were highly &s;ub&s;ervient to the common purpo&s;es of life; often di&s;covering things that were lo&s;t, both animate and inanimate. <HI>An Italian Grey|hound, of a mou&s;e-colour, a white &s;peck in the neck, lame of one leg, belongs to &s;uch a Lady.</HI> Greyhound, <HI>genus;</HI> mou&s;e-colour'd, etc. <HI>differentia;</HI> lame of one leg, <HI>accidens;</HI> belongs to &s;uch a Lady, <HI>pro|prium.</HI></P>
<P>Though I'm afraid I have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed upon my Reader's patience already, I cannot help taking notice of one thing more extraordinary than any yet mentioned; which was Crambe's <HI>Treati&s;e of Syllogi&s;ms.</HI> He &s;uppo&s;ed that a Philo&s;opher's brain was like a great Fore&s;t, where Ideas ranged like animals of &s;everal kinds; that tho&s;e Ideas copu|lated, and engendered Conclu&s;ions; that when tho&s;e of different Species copulate, they bring forth mon&s;ters or ab&s;urdities; that the <HI>Major</HI> is the male, the <HI>Minor</HI> the female, which copulate by the Mid|dle Term, and engender the Conclu&s;ion. Hence they are called the <HI>praemi&s;&s;a,</HI> or Predece&s;&s;ors of the
<PB N="154" REF="160">
Conclu&s;ion; and it is properly &s;aid by the Logici|ans <HI>quod pariant &s;cientiam, opinionem,</HI> they <HI>beget</HI> &s;cience, opinion, etc. Univer&s;al Propo&s;itions are Per&s;ons of quality; and therefore in Logick they are &s;aid to be of the fir&s;t <HI>Figure.</HI> Singular Propo|&s;itions are private per&s;ons, and therefore placed in the third or la&s;t figure, or rank. From tho&s;e principles all the rules of Syllogi&s;ms naturally follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. That there are only three Terms, neither more nor le&s;s; for to a child there can be only one father and one mother.</P>
<P N="2">II. From univer&s;al premi&s;&s;es there follows an uni|ver&s;al conclu&s;ion, as if one &s;hould &s;ay, that per&s;ons of quality always beget per&s;ons of quality.</P>
<P N="3">III. From the &s;ingular premi&s;&s;es follows only a &s;ingular conclu&s;ion, that is, if the parents be only private people, the i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be &s;o like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">IV. From particular propo&s;itions nothing can be concluded, becau&s;e the <HI>Individua vaga</HI> are (like whorema&s;ters and common &s;trumpets) barren.</P>
<P N="5">V. There cannot be more in the conclu&s;ion than was in the premi&s;&s;es, that is, children can only inherit from their parents.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The conclu&s;ion follows the weaker part, that is, children inherit the di&s;ea&s;es of their parents.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="155" REF="161">
VII. From two negatives nothing can be conclud|ed, for from divorce or &s;eparation there can come no i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The medium cannot enter the conclu&s;ion, that being logical ince&s;t.</P>
<P N="9">IX. An hypothetical propo&s;ition is only a con|tract, or a promi&s;e of marriage; from &s;uch therefore there can &s;pring no real i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P N="10">X. When the premi&s;&s;es or parents are nece&s;&s;a|rily join'd (or in lawful wedlock) they beget lawful i&s;&s;ue; but contingently joined, they beget ba&s;tards.</P>
<P>So much for the Affirmative propo&s;itions; the Negative mu&s;t be deferred to another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Crambe u&s;ed to value him&s;elf upon this Sy&s;tem, from whence he &s;aid one might &s;ee the propriety of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;uch a one has a barren imagina|tion;</HI> and how common it is for &s;uch people to <HI>adopt</HI> conclu&s;ions that are not the i&s;&s;ue of their premi&s;&s;es? therefore as an Ab&s;urdity is a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> a Fal&s;ity is a <HI>Ba&s;tard;</HI> and a true conclu&s;ion that followeth not from the premi&s;&s;es, may properly be &s;aid to be <HI>adopted.</HI> But then what is an En|thymem? (quoth Cornelius.) Why, an Enthy|mem (replied Crambe) is when the Major is in|deed married to the Minor, but the Marriage <HI>kept &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>METAPHYSICKS were a large field in which to exerci&s;e the Weapons <HI>Logick</HI> had put into their
<PB N="156" REF="162">
hands. Here Martin and Crambe u&s;ed to engage like any prize-fighters, before their Father, and his other Learned companions of the Sympo&s;iacks. And as Prize-fighters will agree to lay a&s;ide a buck|ler, or &s;ome &s;uch defen&s;ive weapon, &s;o would Crambe promi&s;e not to u&s;e <HI>&s;impliciter et &s;ecundum quid,</HI> provided Martin would part with <HI>materiali|ter et formaliter:</HI> But it was found, that without the help of the defen&s;ive armour of tho&s;e Di&s;tinc|tions, the arguments cut &s;o deep, that they fetch|ed blood at every &s;troke. Their <HI>The&s;es</HI> were picked out of Suarez, Thomas Aquinas, and other learned writers on tho&s;e &s;ubjects. I &s;hall give the Reader a ta&s;te of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. If the Innate De&s;ire of the knowledge of Me|taphy&s;icks was the cau&s;e of the Fall of Adam; and the <HI>Arbor Porphyriana,</HI> the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. If tran&s;cendental goodne&s;s could be truly pre|dicated of the Devil? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Whether one, or many be fir&s;t? or if one doth not &s;uppo&s;e the notion of many? <HI>Suarez.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. If the de&s;ire of news in mankind be <HI>appetitus innatus,</HI> not <HI>elicitus? affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Whether there is in human under&s;tandings po|tential fal&s;ities? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Whether God loves a <HI>po&s;&s;ible Angel</HI> better than an <HI>actually-exi&s;tent flye? deny'd.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="157" REF="163">
VII. If Angels pa&s;s from one extreme to another without going through the middle? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. If Angels know things more clearly in a morning? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Whether every Angel hears what one An|gel &s;ays to another? <HI>deny'd. Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. If temptation be <HI>proprium quarto modo</HI> of the Devil? <HI>deny'd. Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. Whether one Devil can illuminate another? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. If there would have been any females born in the &s;tate of Innocence? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. If the Creation was fini&s;hed in &s;ix days, be|cau&s;e &s;ix is the mo&s;t perfect number; or if &s;ix be the mo&s;t perfect number, becau&s;e the Creation was fini&s;hed in &s;ix days? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;everal others, of which in the cour&s;e of the life of this learned Per&s;on we may have occa&s;ion to treat; and one parti|cularly that remains undecided to this day; it was taken from the learned Suarez.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>An praeter</HI> e&s;&s;e reale <HI>actualis e&s;&s;entiae &s;it aliud</HI> e&s;&s;e nece&s;&s;arium <HI>quo res actualiter exi&s;tat?</HI> In Engli&s;h thus. Whether be&s;ides the real be|ing of actual being, there be any other being nece&s;&s;ary to cau&s;e a thing to be?</P>
<P>This brings into my mind a Project to bani&s;h Metaphy&s;icks out of Spain, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed might be effectuated by this method: That no|body
<PB N="158" REF="164">
&s;hould u&s;e any Compound or Decompound of the Sub&s;tantial Verbs but as they are read in the common conjugations: for every body will allow, that if you debar a Metaphy&s;ician from <HI>ens, e&s;&s;en|tia, entitas, &s;ub&s;i&s;tentia,</HI> &amp;c. there is an end of him.</P>
<P>Crambe regretted extremely, that <HI>Sub&s;tantial Forms,</HI> a race of harmle&s;s beings which had la&s;t|ed for many years, and afforded a comfortable &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to many poor Philo&s;ophers, &s;hould be now hunted down like &s;o many Wolves, without the po&s;&s;ibility of a retreat. He con&s;idered that it had gone much harder with them than with <HI>E&s;&s;ences,</HI> which had retired from the <HI>Schools</HI> into the <HI>Apothe|caries Shops,</HI> where &s;ome of them had been ad|vanced into the degree of <HI>Quinte&s;&s;ences.</HI> He thought there &s;hould be a retreat for poor <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial forms,</HI> among&s;t the Gentlemen-u&s;hers at court; and that there were indeed <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial forms,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>forms of Prayer,</HI> and <HI>forms of Government,</HI> without which the things them&s;elves could never long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. He al&s;o u&s;ed to wonder that there was not a reward for &s;uch as could find out a <HI>fourth Figure</HI> in <HI>Lo|gick,</HI> as well as for tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;cover the <HI>Longitude.</HI></P>

<P>COrnelius, it is certain, had a mo&s;t &s;uper&s;ti|tious veneration for the Ancients; and if they contradicted each other, his Rea&s;on was &s;o pliant and ductile, that he was always of the opi|nion of the la&s;t he read. But he reckoned it a point of honour never to be vanqui&s;hed in a di&s;|pute; from which quality he acquired the Title of the <HI>Invincible Doctor.</HI> While the Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy was demon&s;trating to his &s;on the &s;everal kinds of <HI>Inte&s;tines,</HI> Cornelius affirmed that there were only two, the <HI>Colon</HI> and the <HI>Aichos,</HI> accord|ing to Hippocrates, who it was impo&s;&s;ible could ever be mi&s;taken. It was in vain to a&s;&s;ure him this error proceeded from want of accuracy in dividing the whole Canal of the Guts: Say what you plea&s;e (he replied) this is both mine and Hippocrates's opinion. You may with equal rea|&s;on (an&s;wer'd the Profe&s;&s;or) affirm, that a man's Liver hath five Lobes, and deny the Circulation of the blood. Ocular demon&s;tration (&s;aid Corne|lius) &s;eems to be on your &s;ide, yet I &s;hall not give it up: Show me any vi&s;cus of a human body, and I will bring you a mon&s;ter that differs from the common rule in the &s;tructure of it. If Nature
<PB N="160" REF="166">
&s;hews &s;uch variety in the &s;ame age, why may &s;he not have extended it further in &s;everal ages? Pro|duce me a man now of the age of an Antediluvian; of the &s;trength of Sam&s;on, or the &s;ize of the Gi|ants. If in the whole, why not in parts of the body, may it not be po&s;&s;ible the pre&s;ent genera|tion of men may differ from the Ancients? The Mo|derns have perhaps lenghthened the channel of the guts by Gluttony, and dimini&s;hed the liver by hard drinking. Though it &s;hall be demon&s;trated that modern blood circulates, yet I will believe with Hippocrates, that the blood of the Ancients had a flux and reflux from the heart, like a Tide. Con|&s;ider how Luxury hath introduced new di&s;ea&s;es, and with them not improbably altered the whole Cour&s;e of the Fluids. Con&s;ider how the current of might Rivers, nay the very channels of the O|cean are changed from what they were in ancient days; and can we be &s;o vain to imagine that the Mi|croco&s;m of the human body alone is exempted from the fate of all things? I que&s;tion not but plau&s;ible Conjectures may be made even as to the Time when the blood fir&s;t began to circulate.&mdash;Such di&s;putes as the&s;e frequently perplex'd the Profe&s;&s;or to that degree, that he would now and then in a pa&s;&s;ion leave him in the middle of a Lecture, as he did at this time.</P>
<P>There unfortunately happened &s;oon after, an unu&s;ual accident, which retarded the pro&s;ecution of the &s;tudies of Martin. Having purcha&s;ed the
<PB N="161" REF="167">
body of a Malefactor, he hir'd a Room for its di&s;|&s;ection near the Pe&s;t-fields in St. Giles's, at a lit|tle di&s;tance from Tyburn Road. Crambe (to who&s;e care this body was committed) carried it thither about twelve a clock at night in a Hack|ney-coach, few Hou&s;e-keepers being very willing to let their lodgings to &s;uch kind of Operators. As he was &s;oftly &s;talking up &s;tairs in the dark, with the dead man in his arms, his burthen had like to have &s;lipp'd from him, which he (to &s;ave from fal|ing) gra&s;p'd &s;o hard about the belly, that it forced the wind through the <HI>Anus,</HI> with a noi&s;e exactly like the <HI>Crepitus</HI> of a living man. Crambe (who did not comprehend how this part of the Animal Oeconomy could remain in a dead man) was &s;o terrified, that he threw down the body, ran up to his ma&s;ter, and had &s;carce breath to tell him what had happened. Martin with all his Philo&s;ophy could not prevail upon him to return to his po&s;t.&mdash;You may &s;ay what you plea&s;e (quoth Crambe) no man alive ever broke wind more naturally; nay, he &s;eemed to be mightily relieved by it.&mdash;The rol|ling of the corp&s;e down &s;tairs made &s;uch a noi&s;e that it awaked the whole hou&s;e. The maid &s;hriek'd, the landlady cried out Thieves; but the Landlord, in his &s;hirt as he was, taking a candle in one hand, and a drawn &s;word in the other, ven|tured out of the Room. The maid with only a &s;ingle petticoat ran up &s;tairs, but &s;purning at the dead body, fell upon it in a &s;woon. Now the
<PB N="162" REF="168">

The wife ran into the &s;treet and cried out Murder! the Watch ran in, while Martin and Crambe, hear|ing all this uproar, were coming down &s;tairs. The Watch imagined they were making their e&s;cape, &s;eized them immediately, and carried them to a neighbouring Ju&s;tice; where, upon &s;earching them, &s;everal kind of knives and dreadful weapons were found upon them. The Ju&s;tice fir&s;t examined Crambe.&mdash;What is your Name? &s;ays the Ju&s;tice.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;May it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, as touching the body of this man, I can an&s;wer each head that my accu&s;ers alledge again&s;t me, to a hair. They have hitherto talk'd like num-&s;culls without

brains; but if your Wor&s;hip will not only give ear, but regard me with a favourable eye, I will not be brow-beaten by the &s;upercilious looks of my adver&s;aries, who now &s;tand cheek by jowl by your Wor&s;hip. I will prove to their faces, that their foul mouths have not opened their lips without a fal&s;ity; though they have &s;howed their teeth as if they would bite off my no&s;e. Now, Sir, that I may fairly &s;lip my neck out of the collar, I beg this matter may not be &s;lightly &s;kined over. Tho' I have no man here to back me, I will unbo&s;om my&s;elf, &s;ince Truth is on my &s;ide, and &s;hall give them their bellies full, though they think they have me upon the hip. Whereas they &s;ay I came into their lodg|ings, with arms, and murdered this man with|out their Privity, I declare I had not the lea&s;t finger in it; and &s;ince I am to &s;tand upon my own legs, nothing of this matter &s;hall be left till I &s;et it upon a right foot. In the vein I am in, I cannot for my heart's blood and guts bear this u&s;age: I &s;hall not &s;pare my lungs to defend my good name: I was ever reckoned a good liver; and I think I have the bowels of compa&s;&s;ion. I a&s;k but ju&s;tice, and from the crown of my head to the &s;oal of my foot I &s;hall ever acknowledge my&s;elf your Wor&s;hip's humble Servant.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice &s;tared, the Landlord and Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Martin fretted, while Crambe talk'd in this rambling incoherent man|ner;
<PB N="164" REF="170">
till at length Martin begg'd to be heard. It was with great difficulty that the Ju&s;tice was con|vinced, till they &s;ent for the Fini&s;her of human laws, of whom the Corp&s;e had been purcha&s;ed; who looking near the left ear, knew his own work, and gave Oath accordingly.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Martin got home, but he fell into a pa&s;&s;ion at Crambe. <Q>&startq;What Daemon, he cried, hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thee, that thou wilt never for&s;ake that impertinent cu&s;tom of punning? Neither my coun&s;el nor my example have thus mi&s;led thee; thou governe&s;t thy&s;elf by mo&s;t er|roneous Maxims.&endq;</Q> Far from it (an&s;wers Crambe) my life is as orderly as my Dictionary, for by my Dictionary I order my life. I have made a Ka|lendar of radical words for all the &s;ea&s;ons, months, and days of the year: Every day I am under the dominion of a certain Word: but this day in par|ticular I cannot be mi&s;led, for I am governed by one that rules all &s;exes, ages, conditions, nay all animals rational and irrational.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Martinus's uncommon Practice of Phy|&s;ick, and how he apply'd him&s;elf to the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is high time to return to the Hi&s;tory of the Progre&s;s of Martinus in the Studies of Phy&s;ick, and to enumerate &s;ome at lea&s;t of the many Di&s;coveries and Experiments he made therein.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t was his Method of inve&s;tigating latent Di&s;tempers, by the &s;agacious Quality of <HI>Setting-Dogs</HI> and <HI>Pointers.</HI> The &s;ucce&s;s, and the Adventures that befel him, when he walked with the&s;e Animals, to &s;mell them out in the Parks and publick places about London, are what we would willingly relate; but that his own Account, toge|ther with a <HI>Li&s;t of tho&s;e Gentlemen and Ladies</HI> at whom they made a <HI>Full &s;et,</HI> will be publi&s;hed in time convenient. There will al&s;o be added the Repre&s;entation, which, on occa&s;ion of one di&s;tem|per which was become almo&s;t epidemical, he thought him&s;elf obliged to lay before both Hou&s;es of Parliament, intitled, <HI>A Propo&s;al for a General Flux,</HI> to exterminate at one blow the P&mdash;x out of this kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
But being weary of all practice on <HI>foetid Bodies;</HI> from a certain nicene&s;s of Con&s;titution, (e&s;pecially when he attended Dr. Woodward thro' a Twelve|months cour&s;e of Vomition) he determined to leave it off entirely, and to apply him&s;elf only to di&s;|ea&s;es of the <HI>Mind.</HI> He attempted to find out Spe|cificks for all the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> and as other Phy&s;icians throw their Patients into &s;weats, vomits, purga|tions, etc. he ca&s;t them into Love, Hatred, Hope, Fear, Joy, Grief, etc. And indeed the great Irre|gularity of the Pa&s;&s;ions in the Engli&s;h Nation, was the chief motive that induced him to apply his whole &s;tudies, while he continued among us, to the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e he directed, in the fir&s;t place, his late acquired &s;kill in <HI>Anatomy.</HI> He con&s;ider'd <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Vices</HI> as certain Habits which proceed from the natural Formation and Structure of par|ticular parts of the body. A Bird flies becau&s;e it has Wings, a Duck &s;wims becau&s;e it is web-foot|ed: and there can be no que&s;tion but the adun|city of the pounces and beaks of the Hawks, as well as the length of the fangs, the &s;harpne&s;s of the teeth, and the &s;trength of the crural and ma&s;|&s;eter-mu&s;cles in Lions and Tygers, are the cau&s;e of the great and habitual Immorality of tho&s;e Ani|mals.</P>
<P>1&s;t, He ob&s;erved, that the Soul and Body mu|tually operate upon each other, and therefore if
<PB N="169" REF="175">
you deprive the Mind of the outward In&s;truments whereby &s;he u&s;ually expre&s;&s;eth that Pa&s;&s;ion, you will in time abate the Pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, in like manner as Ca&s;tration abates Lu&s;t.</P>
<P>2dly, That the Soul in mankind expre&s;&s;eth every Pa&s;&s;ion by the Motion of &s;ome particular <HI>Mu&s;cles.</HI></P>
<P>3dly, That all Mu&s;cles grow &s;tronger and thicker by being <HI>much u&s;ed;</HI> therefore the habitual Pa&s;&s;ions may be di&s;cerned in particular per&s;ons by the <HI>&s;trength</HI> and <HI>bigne&s;s</HI> of the Mu&s;cles u&s;ed in the expre&s;&s;ion of that Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>4thly, That a Mu&s;cle may be &s;trengthen'd or weaken'd by weakning or &s;trength'ning the force of its Antagoni&s;t. The&s;e things premi&s;ed, he took notice,</P>
<P>That <HI>Complai&s;ance, humility, a&s;&s;ent, approba|tion,</HI> and <HI>civility,</HI> were expre&s;&s;ed by nodding the head and bowing the body forward: on the con|trary, <HI>di&s;&s;ent, di&s;like, refu&s;al, pride,</HI> and <HI>arrogance,</HI> were marked by to&s;&s;ing the head, and bending the body backwards: which two Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> the Latins rightly expre&s;s'd by the words <HI>adnuere</HI> and <HI>abnuere.</HI> Now he ob&s;erved that com|plai&s;ant and civil people had the Flexors of the head very &s;trong; but in the proud and in&s;olent there was a great over-balance of &s;trength in the Exten|&s;ors of the Neck and the Mu&s;cles of the Back, from
<PB N="170" REF="176">
whence they perform with great facility the mo|tion of <HI>to&s;&s;ing,</HI> but with great difficulty that of <HI>bowing,</HI> and therefore have ju&s;tly acquired the Title of <HI>&s;tiff-neck'd:</HI> In order to reduce &s;uch per|&s;ons to a ju&s;t balance, he judged that the pair of Mu&s;cles called <HI>Recti interni,</HI> the Ma&s;toidal, with other flexors of the head, neck, and body mu&s;t be &s;trengthen'd; their Antagoni&s;ts, the <HI>Splenii Com|plexi,</HI> and the Exten&s;ors of the Spine weaken'd: For which purpo&s;e Nature her&s;elf &s;eems to have directed mankind to correct this Mu&s;cular Immo|rality by tying &s;uch fellows <HI>Neck and heels.</HI></P>
<P>Contrary to this, is the pernicious Cu&s;tom of Mothers, who aboli&s;h the natural Signature of Mo|de&s;ty in their Daughters, by teaching them <HI>to&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>bridling,</HI> rather than the ba&s;hful po&s;ture of <HI>&s;tooping,</HI> and <HI>hanging down the head.</HI> Martinus charged all hu&s;bands to take notice of the <HI>Po&s;ture of the Head</HI> of &s;uch as they courted to Matrimony, as that upon which their future happine&s;s did much depend.</P>
<P><HI>Flatterers,</HI> who have the flexor Mu&s;cles &s;o &s;trong that they are always bowing and cringing, he &s;up|po&s;ed might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be corrected by be|ing tied down upon a Tree by the back, like the children of the Indians; which doctrine was &s;trongly confirm'd by his ob&s;erving the &s;trength of the <HI>levatores Scapulae:</HI> This Mu&s;cle is called the Mu&s;cle of <HI>patience,</HI> becau&s;e in that affection of Mind people &s;hrug and rai&s;e up the &s;houlder to the

<P>In pur&s;uance of his Theory, he &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>con&s;trictors</HI> of the <HI>Eye-lids,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;trengthen'd in the &s;upercilious, the <HI>abductors</HI> in drunkards and contemplative men, who have the &s;ame &s;teddy and grave motion of the eye.

<P>The rolling amorous Eye, in the pa&s;&s;ion of Love, might be corrected by frequently looking thro' gla&s;&s;es. Impertinent fellows that jump upon Tables, and cut capers, might be cur'd by relax|ing medicines applied to the <HI>Calves</HI> of their <HI>Legs,</HI> which in &s;uch people are too &s;trong.</P>

<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e was immoderate <HI>Laughter:</HI> When any of that ri&s;ible &s;pecies were brought to the Doctor, and when he con&s;ider'd what an infi|nity of Mu&s;cles the&s;e laughing Ra&s;cals threw into a convul&s;ive motion at the &s;ame time; whether

<P>AN eminent In&s;tance of Martinus's Sagacity in di&s;covering the Di&s;tempers of the Mind, appeared in the ca&s;e of a young Nobleman at Court, who was ob&s;erved to grow extremely affected in his &s;peech, and whim&s;ical in all his behaviour.

<P><PB N="173" REF="179">
As &s;oon as he had heard and examined all the &s;ymptoms, he pronounced his di&s;temper to be <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>His friends a&s;&s;ured him that they had with great care ob&s;erved all his motions, and were perfectly &s;atisfied there was no Woman in the ca&s;e. Scrib|lerus was as po&s;itive that he was de&s;perately in love with &s;ome per&s;on or other. <Q>&startq;How can that be?

I am a&s;toni&s;hed, people do not enough attend this Di&s;ea&s;e, which has the &s;ame cau&s;es and &s;ymptoms, and admits of the &s;ame cure with the other: e&s;pecially &s;ince here the ca&s;e of the Patient is the more helple&s;s and deplorable of the two, as this unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion is more blind than the other.

Let &s;ome knowing friend re|pre&s;ent to him the many vile Qualities of this Mi|&s;tre&s;s of his: let him be &s;hewn that her Extrava|gance, Pride, and Prodigality will infallibly bring him to a mor&s;el of bread: Let it be proved, that he has been fal&s;e to him&s;elf, and if Treachery is not a &s;ufficient cau&s;e to di&s;card a Mi&s;tre&s;s, what is? In &s;hort let him be made to &s;ee that no mortal be|&s;ides him&s;elf either loves or can &s;uffer this Crea|ture. Let all Looking-gla&s;&s;es, poli&s;hed Toys, and even clean Plates be removed from him, for fear of bringing back the admired object. Let him be taught to put off all tho&s;e tender airs, affected &s;miles, langui&s;hing looks, wanton to&s;&s;es of the head, coy motions of the body, that mincing gait, &s;oft tone of voice, and all that enchanting wo|man-like behaviour, that has made him the charm of his own eyes, and the object of his own adora|tion. Let him &s;urprize the Beauty he adores at a

Afterwards he thought it ab|&s;urd to confine that &s;overeign Lady to one apart|ment, which made him infer that &s;he &s;hifted it according to the &s;everal functions of life: The Brain was her Study, the Heart her State-room, and the Stomach her Kitchen. But as he &s;aw &s;e|veral Offices of life went on at the &s;ame time, he was forced to give up this Hypothe&s;is al&s;o. He now conjectured it was more for the dignity of the Soul to perform &s;everal operations by her little Mi|ni&s;ters, the <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> from whence it was natural to conclude, that &s;he re&s;ides in different parts according to different Inclinations, Sexes, Ages, and Profe&s;&s;ions. Thus in Epicures he &s;eated her in the mouth of the Stomach, Philo&s;o|phers have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fidlers in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers in their Toes. At length he grew fond of the <HI>Glandula Pinealis,</HI> di&s;&s;ecting ma|ny Subjects to find out the different Figure of this Gland, from whence he might di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the different Tempers in mankind. He &s;up|po&s;ed that in factious and re&s;tle&s;s-&s;pirited people he &s;hould find it &s;harp and pointed, allowing no room for the Soul to repo&s;e her&s;elf; that in quiet Tempers it was flat, &s;mooth, and &s;oft, affording to the Soul as it were an ea&s;y cu&s;hion. He was con|firmed in this by ob&s;erving, that Calves and Philo|&s;ophers, Tygers and State&s;men, Foxes and Sharp|ers,

Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Sparrows and Co|quets, Monkeys and Players, Courtiers and Spa|niels, Moles and Mi&s;ers, exactly re&s;emble one an|ther in the conformation of the <HI>Pineal Gland.</HI> He did not doubt likewi&s;e to find the &s;ame re&s;em|blance in Highwaymen and Conquerors: In order to &s;atisfy him&s;elf in which, it was, that he pur|cha&s;ed the body of one of the fir&s;t Species (as hath been before related) at Tyburn, hoping in time to have the happine&s;s of one of the latter too, under his Anatomical knife.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit taking notice here, that the&s;e Enquiries into the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> gave occa&s;ion to his fir&s;t corre&s;pondence with the &s;ociety of <HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI> who were then in their infancy in Eng|land, and &s;o much taken with the promi&s;ing en|dowments of Martin, that they ordered their Se|cretary to write him the following Letter.</P>

<P>IT is with un&s;peakable joy we have heard of your inqui&s;itive Genius, and we think it great pity that it &s;hould not be better employed, than in looking after that Theological Non-entity com|monly call'd the <HI>Soul:</HI> Since after all your enqui|ries, it will appear you have lo&s;t your labour in

&s;eeking the Re&s;idence of &s;uch a Chimera, that ne|ver had being but in the brains of &s;ome dreaming Philo&s;ophers. Is it not <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> to a per&s;on of your Sen&s;e, that, &s;ince <HI>you cannot find it,</HI> there is <HI>no &s;uch thing?</HI> In order to &s;et &s;o hopeful a Ge|nius right in this matter, we have &s;ent you an an|&s;wer to the ill-grounded Sophi&s;ms of tho&s;e crack|brain'd fellows, and likewi&s;e an ea&s;y <HI>mechanical explication</HI> of <HI>Perception</HI> or <HI>Thinking.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This whole Chapter is an inimitable ridicule on <HI>Collins's</HI> arguments again&s;t <HI>Clarke,</HI> to prove the Soul only a Quality.</NOTE> One of their chief Arguments is, that <HI>Self-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> cannot inhere in any &s;y&s;tem of Mat|ter, becau&s;e all matter is made up of &s;everal di|&s;tinct beings, which never can make up one indi|vidual thinking being.</P>
<P>This is ea&s;ily an&s;wered by a familiar in&s;tance. In every <HI>Jack</HI> there is a <HI>meat-roa&s;ting</HI> Quality, which neither re&s;ides in the fly, nor in the weight, nor in any particular wheel of the Jack, but is the re&s;ult of the whole compo&s;ition: So in an Animal, the Self-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is not a real Quality inhe|rent in one Being (any more than meat-roa&s;ting in a Jack) but the re&s;ult of &s;everal Modes or Quali|ties in the &s;ame &s;ubject. As the fly, the wheels, the chain, the weight, the cords, etc. make one Jack, &s;o the &s;everal parts of the body make one Animal. As perception or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is &s;aid to be inherent in this Animal, &s;o is meat-roa&s;ting &s;aid to be inherent in the Jack. As &s;en&s;ation, rea&s;on|ing,
<PB N="181" REF="187">
volition, memory, etc. are the &s;everal Modes of thinking; &s;o roa&s;ting of beef, roa&s;ting of mut|ton, roa&s;ting of pullets, gee&s;e, turkeys, etc. are the &s;everal modes of meat-roa&s;ting. And as the gene|ral Quality of meat-roa&s;ting, with its &s;everal mo|difications as to beef, mutton, pullets, etc. does not inhere in any one part of the Jack; &s;o neither does Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, with its &s;everal Modes of &s;en|&s;ation, intellection, volition, etc. inhere in any one, but is the re&s;ult from the mechanical compo&s;ition of the whole Animal.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o, the Quality or Di&s;po&s;ition in a Fiddle to play tunes, with the &s;everal Modifications of this <HI>tune-playing</HI> quality in playing of Preludes, Sara|bands, Jigs, and Gavotts, are as much real qua|lities in the In&s;trument, as the Thought or the Imagination is in the mind of the Per&s;on that com|po&s;es them.</P>
<P>The Parts (&s;ay they) of an animal body are perpetually changed, and the fluids which &s;eem to be the &s;ubject of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, are in a perpe|tual circulation; &s;o that the &s;ame individual parti|cles do not remain in the Brain; from whence it will follow, that the idea of Individual Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s mu&s;t be con&s;tantly tran&s;lated from one parti|cle of matter to another, whereby the particle A, for example, mu&s;t not only be con&s;cious, but con|&s;cious that it is the &s;ame being with the particle B that went before.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188">
We an&s;wer, this is only a fallacy of the imagi|nation, and is to be under&s;tood in no other &s;en&s;e than that maxim of the Engli&s;h Law, that the <HI>King never dies.</HI> This power of thinking, &s;elf|moving, and governing the whole Machine, is communicated from every Particle to its immedi|ate Succe&s;&s;or; who, as &s;oon as he is gone, imme|diately takes upon him the Government, which &s;till pre&s;erves the Unity of the whole Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>They make a great noi&s;e about this Individua|lity: how a man is con&s;cious to him&s;elf that he is the &s;ame Individual he was twenty years ago; not|with&s;tanding the flux &s;tate of the Particles of mat|ter that compo&s;e his body. We think this is ca|pable of a very plain an&s;wer, and may be ea&s;ily illu&s;trated by a familiar example.</P>
<P>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black wor&s;ted &s;tock|ings, which his maid darn'd &s;o often with &s;ilk, that they became at la&s;t a pair of &s;ilk &s;tockings. Now &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e &s;tockings of Sir John's endued with &s;ome degree of Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at every particular darning, they would have been &s;en&s;ible, that they were the &s;ame individual pair of &s;tockings both be|fore and after the darning; and this &s;en&s;ation would have continued in them through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of darnings; and yet after the la&s;t of all, there was not perhaps one thread left of the fir&s;t pair of &s;tock|ings, but they were grown to be &s;ilk &s;tockings, as was &s;aid before.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="189">
And whereas it is affirmed, that every animal is con&s;cious of &s;ome individual &s;elf-moving, &s;elf-determining principle; it is an&s;wered, that, as in a Hou&s;e of Commons all things are determined by a <HI>Majority,</HI> &s;o it is in every Animal &s;y&s;tem. As that which determines the Hou&s;e is &s;aid to be the rea|&s;on of the whole a&s;&s;embly; it is no otherwi&s;e with thinking Beings, who are determined by the greater force of &s;everal particles; which, like &s;o many unthinking Members, compo&s;e one thinking Sy|&s;tem.</P>
<P>And whereas it is likewi&s;e objected, that Pu|ni&s;hments cannot be ju&s;t that are not inflicted up|on the &s;ame individual, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out the notion of a &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance: We re|ply, that this is no greater difficulty to conceive, than that a Corporation, which is likewi&s;e a flux body, may be puni&s;hed for the faults, and liable to the debts, of their Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>We proceed now to explain, by the &s;tructure of the Brain, the &s;everal Modes of thinking. It is well known to Anatomi&s;ts that the Brain is a <HI>Congeries</HI> of Glands, that &s;eparate the finer parts of the blood, called Animal Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a Canal of a great length, vari|ou&s;ly intorted and wound up together. From the Arieta lion and Motion of the Spirits in tho&s;e Ca|nals, proceed all the different &s;orts of Thoughts. Simple Ideas are produced by the motion of the Spirits in one &s;imple Canal: when two of the&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="190">
Canals di&s;embogue them&s;elves into one, they make what we call a Propo&s;ition; and when two of the&s;e propo&s;itional Chanels empty them&s;elves into a third, they form a Syllogi&s;m, or a Ratiocina|tion. Memory is performed in a di&s;tinct apart|ment of the brain, made up of ve&s;&s;els &s;imilar, and like &s;ituated to the ideal, propo&s;itional, and &s;yllo|gi&s;tical ve&s;&s;els, in the primary parts of the brain. After the &s;ame manner it is ea&s;y to explain the other modes of thinking; as al&s;o why &s;ome peo|ple think &s;o wrong and perver&s;ely, which proceeds from the bad configuration of tho&s;e Glands. Some for example, are born without the propo&s;itional or &s;yllogi&s;tical Canals; in others, that rea&s;on ill, they are of unequal capacities; in dull fellows, of too great a length, whereby the motion of the &s;pirits is retarded; in trifling genius's, weak and &s;mall; in the over-refining &s;pirits, too much in|torted and winding; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>We are &s;o much per&s;uaded of the truth of this our Hypothe&s;is, that we have employed one of our Members, a great Virtuo&s;o at Nuremberg, to make a &s;ort of an Hydraulick Engine, in which a chemical liquor re&s;embling blood, is driven thro' ela&s;tick chanels re&s;embling arteries and veins, by the force of an Embolus like the heart, and wrought by a pneumatick Machine of the nature of the lungs, with ropes and pullies, like the nerves, tendons, and mu&s;cles: And we are per&s;uad|ed that this our artificial Man will not only walk,

<P>IT was in the year 1699 that Martin &s;et out on his <HI>Travels.</HI> Thou wilt certainly be very cu|rious to know what they were. It is not yet time
<PB N="186" REF="192">
to inform thee. But what hints I am at liberty to give, I will.</P>
<P>Thou &s;halt know then, that in his fir&s;t Voyage he was carried by a pro&s;perous Storm, to a Di&s;|covery of the Remains of the ancient <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>That in his &s;econd, he was as happily &s;hip|wreck'd on the Land of the <HI>Giants,</HI> now the mo&s;t humane people in the world.</P>
<P>That in his third Voyage, he di&s;cover'd a whole Kingdom of <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> who govern by the <HI>Ma|thematicks;</HI> with who&s;e admirable Schemes and Projects he returned to benefit his own dear Coun|try; but had the misfortune to find them reject|ed by the envious Mini&s;ters of <HI>Queen Anne,</HI> and him&s;elf &s;ent treacherou&s;ly away.</P>
<P>And hence it is, that in his fourth Voyage he di&s;covers a Vein of Melancholy proceeding almo&s;t to a Di&s;gu&s;t of his Species; but above all, a mor|tal Dete&s;tation to the whole flagitious Race of <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> and a final Re&s;olution not to give in any <HI>Memorial</HI> to the <HI>Secretary of State,</HI> in order to &s;ub|ject the Lands he di&s;covered to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now if, by the&s;e hints, the Reader can help him&s;elf to a farther di&s;covery of the Nature and Contents of the&s;e Travels, he is welcome to as much light as they afford him; I am obliged, by all the tyes of honour, not to &s;peak more openly.</P>

<P>I &s;hall mention only a few of his Philo&s;ophical and Mathematical Works.</P>
<P N="1">1. A compleat Dige&s;t of the Laws of Nature, with a Review of tho&s;e that are ob&s;olete or repeal|ed, and of tho&s;e that are ready to be renew'd and put in force.</P>

much the Inhabitants of the <HI>Moon</HI> eat for Supper; con&s;idering that they pa&s;s a Night equal to fifteen of our natural days.</P>
<P N="8">8. A Demon&s;tration of the natural Dominion of the Inhabitants of the Earth over tho&s;e of the Moon, if ever an intercour&s;e &s;hould be opened be|tween them. With a Propo&s;al of a <HI>Partition-Treaty,</HI> among the earthly Potentates, in ca&s;e of &s;uch di&s;covery.</P>

<P>It will from hence be evident, how much all his Studies were directed to the univer&s;al Benefit of Mankind. Numerous have been his Projects to this end, of which <HI>Two</HI> alone will be &s;ufficient to &s;how the amazing Grandeur of his Genius. The fir&s;t was a Propo&s;al, by a general contribution of all Princes, to pierce the fir&s;t cru&s;t or <HI>Nucleus</HI> of this our <HI>Earth,</HI> quite through, to the next concentri|cal Sphere. The advantage he propo&s;ed from it was, to find the <HI>Parallax</HI> of the <HI>Fixt Stars;</HI> but chiefly to refute Sir I&s;aac Newton's Theory of <HI>Gra|vity,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="197">
and Mr. Halley's of the <HI>Variations.</HI> The &s;e|cond was, to build <HI>Two Poles</HI> to the <HI>Meridian,</HI> with immen&s;e Light-hou&s;es on the top of them; to &s;upply the defect of Nature, and to make the Longitude as ea&s;y to be calculated as the Latitude. Both the&s;e he could not but think very practica|ble, by the Power of all the Potentates of the World.</P>
<P>May we pre&s;ume after the&s;e to mention, how he de&s;cended from the &s;ublime to the beneficial parts of Knowledge, and particularly his extraor|dinary practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI> From the Age, Com|plexion, or Weight of the per&s;on given, he con|trived to pre&s;cribe at a di&s;tance, as well as at a Patient's bed-&s;ide. He taught the way to many modern Phy&s;icians, to cure their Patients by <HI>In|tuition,</HI> and to others to cure <HI>without looking on them at all.</HI> He projected a Men&s;truum to di&s;&s;olve the Stone, made of Dr. Woodward's <HI>Univer&s;al Deluge|water.</HI> His al&s;o was the device to relieve Con|&s;umptive or A&s;thmatick per&s;ons by bringing fre&s;h Air out of the Country to Town, by pipes of the nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps: And to introduce the Native air of a man's country into any other in which he &s;hould travel, with a &s;ea|&s;onable Intromi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Steams as were mo&s;t familiar to him; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible comfort of many Scot&s;men, Laplanders, and white Bears.</P>
<P>In <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> his penetration is &s;uch, that from the <HI>Picture</HI> only of any per&s;on, he can write
<PB N="192" REF="198">
his <HI>Life;</HI> and from the features of the Parents, draw the Portrait of any Child that is to be born.</P>
<P>Nor hath he been &s;o enrapt in the&s;e Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts of Painting, Architec|ture, Mu&s;ick, Poetry, etc. It was he that gave the fir&s;t hint to our modern <HI>Painters,</HI> to improve the <HI>Likene&s;s</HI> of their Portraits by the u&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Co|lours</HI> as would faithfully and con&s;tantly accompany the <HI>Life,</HI> not only in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, but in all its alterations, decays, age, and death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In <HI>Architecture,</HI> he builds not with &s;o much regard to pre&s;ent &s;ymmetry or conveniency, as with a Thought well worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to wit, the noble effect the Building will have to po&s;terity, when it &s;hall fall and become a Ruin.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> I think Heidegger has not the face to deny that he has been much beholden to his Scores.</P>
<P>In <HI>Poetry,</HI> he hath appeared under a hundred different names, of which we may one day give a Catalogue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Politicks,</HI> his Writings are of a peculiar Ca&s;t, for the mo&s;t part Ironical, and the Drift of them often &s;o delicate and refin'd as to be mi&s;taken by the vulgar. He once went &s;o far as to write a Per|&s;ua&s;ive to people to eat their own Children, which was &s;o little under&s;tood as to be taken in ill part <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Swift's ironical tract on that &s;ubject.</NOTE>. He has often written again&s;t <HI>Liberty</HI> in the name

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been long (my dear Countrymen) the &s;ubject of my concern and &s;urprize, that whereas numberle&s;s Poets, Critics, and Orators have compiled and dige&s;ted the Art of ancient Poe&s;y, there hath not ari&s;en among us one per&s;on &s;o publick-&s;pirited, as to perform the like for the Modern. Although it is univer&s;ally known, that our every-way indu&s;trious Moderns, both in the Weight of their writings, and in the Velocity of their judgments, do &s;o infinitely excel the &s;aid An|cients.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, too true it is, that while a plain and direct road is paved to their <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Sublime; no track has been yet chalk'd out, to arrive at our <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Profund. The Latins, as they came between the Greeks and Us, make u&s;e of the word <HI>Altitudo,</HI> which implies equally height and depth. Wherefore con&s;idering with no &s;mall grief, how ma|ny promi&s;ing Genius's of this age are wandering (as
<PB N="198" REF="203">
I may &s;ay) in the dark without a guide, I have undertaken this arduous but nece&s;&s;ary ta&s;k, to lead them as it were by the hand, and &s;tep by &s;tep, the gentle down-hill way to the Bathos; the bot|tom, the end, the central point, the <HI>non plus ul|tra,</HI> of true Modern Poe&s;y!</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider (my dear Countrymen) the extent, fertility, and populou&s;ne&s;s of our Low|lands of Parna&s;&s;us, the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our Trade, and the plenty of our Manufacture; there are two reflections which admini&s;ter great occa&s;ion of &s;urprize: The one, that all dignities and honours &s;hould be be&s;towed upon the exceeding few mea|ger inhabitants of the Top of the mountain; the other, that our own nation &s;hould have arrived to that pitch of greatne&s;s it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, without any regular Sy&s;tem of Laws. As to the fir&s;t, it is with great plea&s;ure I have ob&s;erved of late the gradual decay of Delicacy and Refinement among mankind, who are become too rea&s;onable to re|quire that we &s;hould labour with infinite pains to come up to the ta&s;te of the&s;e Mountaineers, when they without any may conde&s;cend to ours. But as we have now an unque&s;tionable Majority on our &s;ide, I doubt not but we &s;hall &s;hortly be able to level the Highlanders, and procure a farther vent for our own product, which is already &s;o much reli&s;hed, encouraged, and rewarded, by the Nobi|lity and Gentry of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="204">
Therefore to &s;upply our former defect, I pur|po&s;e to collect the &s;cattered Rules of our Art into regular In&s;titutes, from the example and practice of the deep Genius's of our nation; imitating here|in my predece&s;&s;ors the Ma&s;ter of Alexander, and the Secretary of the renowned Zenobia. And in this my undertaking I am the more animated, as I expect more &s;ucce&s;s than has attended even tho&s;e great Critics; &s;ince their Laws (tho' they might be good) have ever been &s;lackly executed, and their Precepts (however &s;trict) obey'd only by fits, and by a very &s;mall number.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I intend to do ju&s;tice upon our neighbours, inhabitants of the upper Parna&s;|&s;us; who, taking advantage of the ri&s;ing ground, are perpetually throwing down rubbi&s;h, dirt and &s;tones upon us, never &s;uffering us to live in peace. The&s;e men, while they enjoy the cry&s;tal &s;tream of Helicon, envy us our common water, which (thank our &s;tars) tho' it is &s;omewhat muddy, flows in much greater abundance. Nor is this the greate&s;t inju&s;tice that we have to complain of; for though it is evident that we never made the lea&s;t attempt or inrode into Their territories, but lived contented in our native fens; they have often not only committed Petty Larcenies upon our borders, but driven the country, and carried off at once whole Cart-loads of our manufacture; to reclaim &s;ome of which &s;tolen goods is part of the de&s;ign of this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="205">
For we &s;hall &s;ee in the cour&s;e of this work, that our greate&s;t Adver&s;aries have &s;ometimes de&s;cend|ed towards us; and doubtle&s;s might now and then have arrived at the Bathos it&s;elf, had it not been for that mi&s;taken opinion they all entertained, that the Rules of the Ancients were equally nece&s;&s;ary to the Moderns; than which there cannot be a more grievous Error, as will be amply proved in the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And indeed when any of the&s;e have gone &s;o far, as by the light of their own Genius to attempt <HI>new</HI> Models, it is wonderful to ob&s;erve, how nearly they have approached us in tho&s;e particular pieces; though in their others they differ'd <HI>toto caelo</HI> from us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That the Bathos, or Profund, is the na|tural Ta&s;te of Man, and in particular, of the pre&s;ent Age.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ta&s;te of the Bathos is implanted by Nature it&s;elf in the &s;oul of man; till, per|verted by cu&s;tom or example, he is taught, or ra|ther compelled, to reli&s;h the Sublime. Accord|ingly, we &s;ee the unprejudiced minds of Children delight only in &s;uch productions, and in &s;uch
<PB N="201" REF="206">
images, as our true modern writers &s;et before them. I have ob&s;erved how fa&s;t the general Ta&s;te is re|turning to this fir&s;t Simplicity and Innocence: and if the intent of all Poetry be to divert and in&s;truct, certainly that kind which diverts and in&s;tructs the <HI>greate&s;t number,</HI> is to be preferred. Let us look round among the Admirers of Poetry, we &s;hall find tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te of the Sublime to be very few; but the Profund &s;trikes univer&s;ally, and is adapted to every capacity. 'Tis a fruitle&s;s undertaking to write for men of a nice and foppi&s;h Gu&s;to, whom after all it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e; and 'tis &s;till more chimerical to write for Po&s;terity, of who&s;e Ta&s;te we cannot make any judgment, and who&s;e Applau&s;e we can never en|joy. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed our wi&s;er authors have a pre&s;ent end,
<Q><L>Et prode&s;&s;e volunt et delectare Poetae.</L></Q>
Their true de&s;ign is Profit or Gain; in order to acquire which, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to procure applau&s;e by admini&s;tring plea&s;ure to the reader: From whence it follows demon&s;trably, that their pro|ductions mu&s;t be &s;uited to the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Ta&s;te. And I cannot but congratulate our age on this peculiar felicity, that though we have made indeed great progre&s;s in all other branches of Luxury, we are not yet debauched with any high Reli&s;h in Poe|try, but are in this one Ta&s;te le&s;s nice than our ance&s;tors. If an Art is to be e&s;timated by its &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="202" REF="207">
I appeal to experience whether there have not been, in proportion to their number, as many &s;tarving good Poets, as bad ones.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in making Gain the principal end of our Art, far be it from me to exclude any great Genius's of <HI>Rank</HI> or <HI>Fortune</HI> from diverting them|&s;elves this way. They ought to be prai&s;ed no le&s;s than tho&s;e Princes, who pa&s;s their vacant hours in &s;ome ingenious mechanical or manual Art. And to &s;uch as the&s;e, it would be ingratitude not to own, that our Art has been often infinitely in|debted.</P>

<P>FArthermore, it were great cruelty and inju&s;|tice, if all &s;uch Authors as cannot write in the other way, were prohibited from writing at all. Again&s;t this I draw an argument from what &s;eems to me an undoubted phy&s;ical Maxim, That Poe|try is a natural or morbid Secretion from the Brain. As I would not &s;uddenly &s;top a cold in the head, or dry up my neighbour's I&s;&s;ue, I would as little hinder him from nece&s;&s;ary writing. It may be af|firmed with great truth, that there is hardly any
<PB N="203" REF="208">
human creature pa&s;t childhood, but at one time or other has had &s;ome Poetical Evacuation, and, no que&s;tion, was much the better for it in his health; &s;o true is the &s;aying, <HI>Na&s;cimur Poetae.</HI> Therefore is the De&s;ire of Writing properly term'd <HI>Pruritus,</HI> the <Q>&startq;Titillation of the Generative Faculty of the Brain,&endq;</Q> and the Per&s;on is &s;aid to conceive; now &s;uch as conceive mu&s;t bring forth. I have known a man thoughtful, melancholy and raving for di|vers days, who forthwith grew wonderfully ea&s;y, light&s;ome, and cheerful, upon a di&s;charge of the peccant humour, in exceeding purulent Metre. Nor can I que&s;tion, but abundance of untimely deaths are occa&s;ioned for want of this laudable vent of unruly pa&s;&s;ions: yea, perhaps, in poor wretches, (which is very lamentable) for mere want of pen, ink, and paper! From hence it follows, that a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the very wor&s;t Poetry is of dangerous con&s;equence to the State. We find by experience, that the &s;ame humours which vent them&s;elves in &s;ummer in Ballads and Sonnets, are conden&s;ed by the winter's cold into Pamphlets and Speeches for and again&s;t the Mini&s;try: Nay, I know not but many times a piece of Poetry may be the mo&s;t in|nocent compo&s;ition of a Mini&s;ter him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is therefore manife&s;t that <HI>Mediocrity</HI> ought to be allowed, yea indulged, to the good Subjects of England. Nor can I conceive how the world has &s;wallowed the contrary as a Maxim, upon the &s;in|gle

<P>However, far be it from me to compare the&s;e Writers with tho&s;e great Spirits, who are born with a <HI>Vivacit&eacute; de pe&s;anteur,</HI> or (as an Engli&s;h Author calls it) an "Alacrity of &s;inking;" and who by &s;trength of Nature alone can excel.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That there is an Art of the Bathos, or Profund.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to prove, that there is an Art of Sinking in Poetry. Is there not an Architecture of Vaults and Cellars, as well as of lofty Domes and Pyramids? Is there not as much &s;kill and labour in making Dikes, as in rai|&s;ing Mounts? Is there not an Art of Diving as well as of Flying? And will any &s;ober practitioner affirm, that a diving Engine is not of &s;ingular u&s;e in making him long-winded, a&s;&s;i&s;ting his &s;ight,
<PB N="205" REF="210">
and furni&s;hing him with other ingenious means of keeping under water?</P>
<P>If we &s;earch the Authors of Antiquity, we &s;hall find as few to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed in the true Profund, as in the true Sublime. And the very &s;ame thing (as it appears from Longinus) had been imagined of that, as now of this: namely, that it was entirely the Gift of Nature. I grant that to excel in the Bathos a Genius is requi&s;ite; yet the Rules of Art mu&s;t be allowed &s;o far u&s;e|ful, as to add weight, or, as I may &s;ay, hang on lead, to facilitate and enforce our de&s;cent, to guide us to the mo&s;t advantageous declivities, and habi|tuate our imagination to a depth of thinking. Many there are that can fall, but few can arrive at the felicity of falling gracefully; much more for a man who is among&s;t the lowe&s;t of the Creation, at the very bottom of the Atmo&s;phere, to de&s;cend beneath him&s;elf, is not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k unle&s;s he calls in Art to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is with the Bathos as with &s;mall Beer, which is indeed vapid and in&s;i|pid, if left at large, and let abroad; but being by our Rules confined and well &s;topt, nothing grows &s;o frothy, pert, and bouncing.</P>
<P>The Sublime of Nature is the Sky, the Sun, Moon, Stars, etc. The Profund of Nature is Gold, Pearls, precious Stones, and the Trea&s;ures of the Deep, which are ine&s;timable as unknown. But all that lies between the&s;e, as Corn, Flower, Fruits, Animals, and Things for the meer u&s;e of
<PB N="206" REF="211">
Man, are of mean price, and &s;o common as not to be greatly e&s;teemed by the curious. It being certain that any thing, of which we know the true u&s;e, cannot be invaluable: Which affords a &s;olu|tion, why common Sen&s;e hath either been totally de&s;pi&s;ed, or held in &s;mall repute, by the greate&s;t modern Critics and Authors.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Genius for the Profund, and by what it is con&s;tituted.</HEAD>
<P>AND I will venture to lay it down, as the fir&s;t Maxim and Corner-Stone of this our Art; that whoever would excel therein, mu&s;t &s;tu|diou&s;ly avoid, dete&s;t, and turn his head from all the ideas, ways, and workings of that pe&s;tilent Foe to Wit, and De&s;troyer of fine Figures, which is known by the Name of <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> His bu&s;i|ne&s;s mu&s;t be to contract the true <HI>Gout de travers;</HI> and to acquire a mo&s;t happy, uncommon, unac|countable Way of Thinking.</P>
<P>He is to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a Grote&s;que painter, who&s;e works would be &s;poiled by an imitation of nature, or uniformity of de&s;ign. He is to mingle bits of the mo&s;t various, or di&s;cordant kinds, land|&s;cape, hi&s;tory, portraits, animals, and connect
<PB N="207" REF="212">
them with a great deal of flouri&s;hing, by heads or tails, as it &s;hall plea&s;e his imagination, and con|tribute to his principal end, which is to glare by &s;trong oppo&s;itions of colours, and &s;urprize by con|trariety of images.</P>
<Q><L>Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni. <BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>His de&s;ign ought to be like a labyrinth, out of which no body can get clear but him&s;elf. And &s;ince the great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth with Fiction, in order to join the <HI>Credible</HI> with the <HI>Surprizing;</HI> our author &s;hall produce the Cre|dible, by painting nature in her lowe&s;t &s;implicity; and the Surprizing, by contradicting common opi|nion. In the very Manners he will affect the <HI>Marvellous;</HI> he will draw Achilles with the pati|ence of Job; a Prince talking like a Jack-pud|ding; a Maid of honour &s;elling bargains; a foot|man &s;peaking like a philo&s;opher; and a fine gen|tleman like a &s;cholar. Whoever is conver&s;ant in modern Plays, may make a mo&s;t noble collection of this kind, and, at the &s;ame time, form a com|plete body of <HI>modern Ethics and Morality.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing &s;eemed more plain to our great au|thors, than that the world had long been weary of <HI>natural things.</HI> How much the contrary are form|ed to plea&s;e, is evident from the univer&s;al applau&s;e daily given to the admirable entertainments of Harlequins and Magicians on our &s;tage.

<P>He ought therefore to render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this happy and <HI>anti-natural</HI> way of thinking to &s;uch a degree, as to be able, on the appearance of any object, to furni&s;h his imagination with ideas infinitely <HI>below</HI> it.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the &s;everal Kinds of Genius's in the Profund, and the Marks and Charac|ters of each.</HEAD>
<P>I Doubt not but the reader, by this Cloud of ex|amples, begins to be convinced of the truth of our a&s;&s;ertion, that the Bathos is an <HI>Art;</HI> and that the Genius of no mortal whatever, following the mere ideas of Nature, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted with an habitual, nay laborious peculiarity of thinking, could arrive at images &s;o wonderfully low and un|accountable. The great author, from who&s;e trea|&s;ury we have drawn all the&s;e in&s;tances (the Fa|ther of the Bathos, and indeed the Homer of it) has, like that immortal Greek, confined his labours to the greater Poetry, and thereby left room for
<PB N="213" REF="218">
others to acquire a due &s;hare of prai&s;e in inferior kinds. Many painters who could never hit a no&s;e or an eye, have with felicity copied a &s;mall-pox, or been admirable at a toad or a red herring. And &s;eldom are we without genius's for <HI>Still-life,</HI> which they can work up and &s;tiffen with incredible ac|curacy.</P>
<P>An univer&s;al Genius ri&s;es not in an age; but when he ri&s;es, armies ri&s;e in him! he pours forth five or &s;ix Epic Poems with greater facility, than five or &s;ix pages can be produced by an elaborate and &s;ervile copier after Nature or the Ancients. It is affirmed by Quintilian, that the &s;ame genius which made Germanicus &s;o great a General, would with equal application have made him an excellent Heroic Poet. In like manner, rea&s;oning from the affinity there appears between Arts and Sciences, I doubt not but an active catcher of butterflies, a careful and fanciful pattern-drawer, an indu&s;trious collector of &s;hells, a laborious and tuneful bag|piper, or a diligent breeder of tame rabbits, might &s;everally excel in their re&s;pective parts of the Ba|thos.</P>
<P>I &s;hall range the&s;e confined and le&s;s copious Ge|nius's under proper cla&s;&s;es, and (the better to give their pictures to the reader) under the names of <HI>Animals</HI> of &s;ome &s;ort or other; whereby he will be enabled, at the fir&s;t &s;ight of &s;uch as &s;hall daily come forth, to know to what kind to refer, and with what Authors to compare them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Profund, when it con&s;i&s;ts in the Thought.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already laid down the Principles upon which our author is to proceed, and the manner of forming his Thought by familiariz|ing
<PB N="216" REF="221">
his mind to the lowe&s;t objects; to which it may be added, that Vulgar Conver&s;ation will great|ly contribute. There is no que&s;tion but the Gar|ret or the Printer's boy may often be di&s;cerned in the compo&s;itions made in &s;uch &s;cenes and com|pany; and much of Mr. Curl him&s;elf has been in|&s;en&s;ibly infu&s;ed into the works of his learned writers.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;ician, by the &s;tudy and in&s;pection of urine and ordure, approves him&s;elf in the &s;cience; and in like &s;ort &s;hould our author accu&s;tom and ex|erci&s;e his imagination upon the dregs of nature.</P>
<P>This will render his thoughts truly and funda|mentally low, and carry him many fathoms be|yond Mediocrity. For, certain it is (tho' &s;ome lukewarm heads imagine they may be &s;afe by tem|porizing between the extremes) that where there is not a Triticalne&s;s or Mediocrity in the Thought, it can never be &s;unk into the genuine and perfect Bathos, by the mo&s;t elaborate low Expre&s;&s;ion: It can, at mo&s;t, be only carefully ob&s;cured, or me|taphorically deba&s;ed. But 'tis the Thought alone that &s;trikes, and gives the whole that &s;pirit, which we admire and &s;tare at. For in&s;tance, in that inge|nious piece on a lady's drinking the Bath-waters:</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Anon.</NOTE> She drinks! She drinks! Behold the matchle&s;s dame!</L>
<L>To her 'tis water, but to us 'tis flame:</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="222">
Thus fire is water, water fire by turns,</L>
<L>And the &s;ame &s;tream at once both cools and burns.</L>
</LG>
<P>What can be more ea&s;y and unaffected than the Diction of the&s;e ver&s;es? 'Tis the Turn of Thought alone, and the Variety of Imagination, that charm and &s;urprize us. And when the &s;ame lady goes into the Bath, the Thought (as in ju&s;tne&s;s it ought) goes &s;till deeper.</P>
<Q><L>"Venus beheld her, 'mid&s;t her croud of &s;laves,</L>
<L>And thought her&s;elf ju&s;t ri&s;en from the waves.</L></Q>
<P>How much out of the way of common &s;en&s;e is this reflection of Venus, not knowing her&s;elf from the lady?</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature is that noble mi&s;take of a frighted &s;tag in a full chace, who (&s;aith the Poet)
<Q><L>Hears his own feet, and thinks they &s;ound like more;</L>
<L>And fears the hind feet will o'ertake the fore.</L></Q></P>
<P>So a&s;toni&s;hing as the&s;e are, they yield to the fol|lowing, which is Profundity it&s;elf,
<Q><L><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Theobald, Double Fal&s;hood.</NOTE> None but Him&s;elf can be his Parallel.</L></Q>
Unle&s;s it may &s;eem borrowed from the Thought of that Ma&s;ter of a Show in Smithfield, who writ in large letters, over the picture of his elephant,
<Q><L>This is the greate&s;t Elephant in the world, except Him&s;elf. <NOTE PLACE="foot">^y Idem.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223">
However our next in&s;tance is certainly an ori|ginal: Speaking of a beautiful infant,</P>
<LG>
<L>So fair thou art, that if great Cupid be</L>
<L>A child, as Poets &s;ay, &s;ure thou art he.</L>
<L>Fair Venus would mi&s;take thee for her own,</L>
<L>Did not thy eyes proclaim thee not her &s;on.</L>
<L>There all the lightnings of thy Mother's &s;hine,</L>
<L>And with a fatal brightne&s;s kill in thine.</L>
</LG>
<P>Fir&s;t he is Cupid, then he is not Cupid; fir&s;t Venus would mi&s;take him, then &s;he would not mi|&s;take him; next his Eyes are his Mother's, and la&s;tly they are not his Mother's, but his own.</P>
<P>Another author, de&s;cribing a Poet that &s;hines forth amid&s;t a circle of Critics,
<Q><L>Thus Phoebus thro' the Zodiac takes his way,</L>
<L>And amid Mon&s;ters ri&s;es into day.</L></Q></P>
<P>What a peculiarity is here of invention? The Author's pencil, like the wand of Circe, turns all into mon&s;ters at a &s;troke. A great Genius takes things in the lump, without &s;topping at minute con&s;iderations: In vain might the ram, the bull, the goat, the lion, the crab, the &s;corpion, the fi&s;hes, all &s;tand in his way, as mere natural ani|mals: much more might it be pleaded that a pair of &s;cales, an old man, and two innocent children, were no mon&s;ters: There were only the Centaur and the Maid that could be e&s;teemed out of na|ture. But what of that? with a boldne&s;s peculiar

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Imitation, and the Manner of Imitating.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the true authors of the Profund are to imitate diligently the examples in their <HI>own way,</HI> is not to be que&s;tioned, and that divers have by this means attained to a depth whereunto their own weight could never have carried them, is evident by &s;undry in&s;tances. Who &s;ees not that De Foe was the poetical &s;on of Withers, Tate of Ogilby, E. Ward of John Taylor, and E&mdash;n of Blackmore? Therefore when we &s;it down to write, let us bring &s;ome great author to our mind, and a&s;k our&s;elves this que&s;tion; How would Sir Richard have &s;aid this? Do I expre&s;s my&s;elf as &s;imply as Amb. Philips? Or flow my numbers with the quiet thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of Mr. Wel&s;ted?</P>

<PB N="224" REF="229">
Yet is not this a paradox? As Virgil is &s;aid to have read Ennius, out of his dunghill to draw gold, &s;o may our author read Shake&s;pear, Milton, and Dryden for the contrary end, to bury their gold in his own dunghil. A true Genius, when he finds any thing lofty or &s;hining in them, will have the &s;kill to bring it down, take off the glo&s;s, or quite di&s;charge the colour, by &s;ome ingenious Circum&s;tance or Periphra&s;e, &s;ome addition or di|minution, or by &s;ome of tho&s;e Figures, the u&s;e of which we &s;hall &s;hew in our next chapter.</P>
<P>The book of Job is acknowledged to be infi|nitely &s;ublime, and yet has not the father of the Bathos reduced it in every page? Is there a pa&s;|&s;age in all Virgil more painted up and laboured than the de&s;cription of Aetna in the third Aeneid?</P>

<P>It may be expected, that, like other Critics, I &s;hould next &s;peak of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions:</HI> But as the main end and principal effect of the Bathos is to produce <HI>Tranquillity of Mind,</HI> (and &s;ure it is a better de&s;ign to promote <HI>&s;leep</HI> than madne&s;s) we have little to &s;ay on this &s;ubject. Nor will the &s;hort bounds of this di&s;cour&s;e allow us to treat at large of the <HI>Emol|lients</HI> and <HI>Opiats</HI> of Poe&s;y, of the Cool, and the manner of producing it, or of the methods u&s;ed by our authors in managing the Pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;hall but tran&s;iently remark, that nothing contributes &s;o much to the <HI>Cool,</HI> as the u&s;e of <HI>Wit</HI> in expre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion: The true genius rarely fails of points, conceits, and proper <HI>&s;imiles</HI> on &s;uch occa&s;ions: This we may term the <HI>Pathetic epigrammatical,</HI> in which even puns are made u&s;e of with good &s;uc|ce&s;s. Hereby our be&s;t authors have avoided throw|ing them&s;elves or their readers into any indecent Tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>But as it is &s;ometimes needful to excite the <HI>pa&s;|&s;ions</HI> of our antagoni&s;t in the polemic way, the true &s;tudents in the law have con&s;tantly taken their me|thods from low life, where they ob&s;erved, that, to move Anger, u&s;e is made of &s;colding and railing; to move Love, of bawdry; to beget Favour and Friend&s;hip, of gro&s;s flattery; and to produce Fear, of calumniating an adver&s;ary with crimes obnox|ious to the State. As for Shame, it is a &s;illy pa&s;|&s;ion,

In order whereto, I think I &s;hall in the &s;econd place highly de&s;erve of my Country, by propo&s;ing &s;uch a <HI>Scheme,</HI> as may fa|cilitate this great end.</P>
<P>As our Number is confe&s;&s;edly far &s;uperior to that of the enemy, there &s;eems nothing wanting but Unanimity among our&s;elves. It is therefore humbly offered, that all and every individual of the Bathos do enter into a firm a&s;&s;ociation, and in|corporate into One regular Body, whereof every member, even the meane&s;t, will &s;ome way con|tribute to the &s;upport of the whole; in like man|ner, as the weake&s;t reeds, when joined in one bun|dle, become infrangible. To which end our Art ought to be put upon the &s;ame foot with other Arts of this age. The va&s;t improvement of mo|dern
<PB N="252" REF="257">
manufactures ari&s;eth from their being divid|ed into &s;everal branches, and parcelled out to &s;e|veral trades: For in&s;tance, in Clock-making one arti&s;t makes the balance, another the &s;pring, ano|ther the crown-wheels, a fourth the ca&s;e, and the principal workman puts all together: To this oeco|nomy we owe the perfection of our modern watches, and doubtle&s;s we al&s;o might that of our modern Poetry and Rhetoric, were the &s;everal parts branched out in the like manner.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than that divers per|&s;ons, no other way remarkable, have each a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to the formation of &s;ome particular Trope or Figure. Ari&s;totle &s;aith, that the <HI>Hyper|bole</HI> is an ornament fit for young Men of Quality; accordingly we find in tho&s;e Gentlemen a wonder|ful propen&s;ity toward it, which is marvellou&s;ly improved by Travelling: Soldiers al&s;o and Seamen are very happy in the &s;ame Figure. The <HI>Peri|phra&s;is</HI> or <HI>Circumlocution</HI> is the peculiar talent of Country Farmers; the <HI>Proverb</HI> and <HI>Apologue</HI> of old Men at their clubs; the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> or Speech by half words, of Mini&s;ters and Politicians, the <HI>Apo|&s;iope&s;is</HI> of Courtiers, the <HI>Litotes</HI> or Diminution of Ladies, Whi&s;perers and Backbiters, and the <HI>Ana|diplo&s;is</HI> of common Cryers and Hawkers, who, by redoubling the &s;ame words, per&s;uade people to buy their oy&s;ters, green ha&s;tings, or new ballads. <HI>Epithets</HI> may be found in great plenty at Billin&s;|gate, <HI>Sarca&s;m</HI> and <HI>Irony</HI> learned upon the Water,
<PB N="253" REF="258">
and the <HI>Epiphonema</HI> or <HI>Exclamation</HI> frequently from the Beargarden, and as frequently from the <HI>Hear him</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>Now each man applying his whole time and genius upon his particular Figure, would doubtle&s;s attain to perfection; and when each became in|corporated and &s;worn into the Society (as hath been propo&s;ed) a Poet or Orator would have no more to do but to &s;end to the particular Traders in each Kind, to the <HI>Metaphori&s;t</HI> for his <HI>Allegories,</HI> to the <HI>Simile-maker</HI> for his <HI>Compari&s;ons,</HI> to the <HI>Iro|ni&s;t</HI> for his <HI>Sarca&s;ms,</HI> to the <HI>Apothegmati&s;t</HI> for his <HI>Sentences,</HI> etc. whereby a Dedication or Speech would be compo&s;ed in a moment, the &s;uperior ar|ti&s;t having nothing to do but to put together all the Materials.</P>
<P>I therefore propo&s;e that there be contrived with all convenient di&s;patch, at the publick expence, a <HI>Rhetorical Che&s;t of Drawers,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three Stories, the highe&s;t for the <HI>Deliberative,</HI> the mid|dle for the <HI>Demon&s;trative,</HI> and the lowe&s;t for the <HI>Judicial.</HI> The&s;e &s;hall be divided into <HI>Loci,</HI> or <HI>Places,</HI> being repo&s;itories for Matter and Argu|ment in the &s;everal kinds of oration or writing; and every Drawer &s;hall again be &s;ub-divided into Cells, re&s;embling tho&s;e of Cabinets for Rarities. The apartment for <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War,</HI> and that of the <HI>Liberty of the Pre&s;s,</HI> may in a very few days be filled with &s;everal arguments perfectly new; and the <HI>Vituperative Partition</HI> will as ea&s;ily be reple|ni&s;hed
<PB N="254" REF="259">
with a mo&s;t choice collection, entirely of the growth and manufacture of the pre&s;ent age. Every compo&s;er will &s;oon be taught the u&s;e of this Cabinet, and how to manage all the Regi&s;ters of it, which will be drawn out much in the manner of tho&s;e in an Organ.</P>
<P>The Keys of it mu&s;t be kept in hone&s;t hands, by &s;ome <HI>Reverend Prelate,</HI> or <HI>Valiant Officer,</HI> of unque&s;tioned Loyalty and Affection to every pre|&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment in Church and State; which will &s;ufficiently guard again&s;t any mi&s;chief which might otherwi&s;e be apprehended from it.</P>
<P>And being lodged in &s;uch hands, it may be at di&s;cretion <HI>let out</HI> by the <HI>Day,</HI> to &s;everal great Ora|tors in both Hou&s;es; from whence it is to be hoped much <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Gain</HI> will al&s;o accrue to our Society.</P>

<P>NOW of what ncce&s;&s;ity the foregoing Pro|ject may prove, will appear from this &s;in|gle con&s;ideration, that nothing is of equal con&s;e|quence to the &s;ucce&s;s of our Works, as <HI>Speed</HI> and
<PB N="255" REF="260">
<HI>Di&s;patch.</HI> Great pity it is, that &s;olid brains are not like other &s;olid bodies, con&s;tantly endowed with a velocity in &s;inking, proportioned to their heavine&s;s: For it is with the Flowers of the Ba|thos as with tho&s;e of Nature, which if the careful gardener brings not ha&s;tily to market in the Morn|ing, mu&s;t unprofitably peri&s;h and wither before Night. And of all our Productions none is &s;o &s;hort-lived as the <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Panegyric,</HI> which are often but the <HI>Prai&s;e of a Day,</HI> and become by the next, utterly u&s;ele&s;s, improper, indecent, and fal&s;e. This is the more to be lamented, in|a&s;much as the&s;e two are the &s;orts whereon in a manner depends that <HI>Profit,</HI> which mu&s;t &s;till be remembered to be the main end of our <HI>Writers</HI> and <HI>Speakers.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore employ this chapter in &s;hew|ing the quicke&s;t method of compo&s;ing them; after which we will teach a <HI>&s;hort Way to Epic Poetry.</HI> And the&s;e being confe&s;&s;edly the works of mo&s;t Importance and Difficulty, it is pre&s;umed we may leave the re&s;t to each author's own learning or practice.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of <HI>Panegyric:</HI> Every man is <HI>honourable,</HI> who is &s;o by Law, Cu&s;tom, or Title. The <HI>Pub|lick</HI> are better judges of what is honourable than private Men. The Virtues of great Men, like tho&s;e of Plants, are inherent in them whether they are exerted or not; and the more &s;trongly inhe|rent, the le&s;s they are exerted; as a Man is the
<PB N="256" REF="261">
more rich, the le&s;s he &s;pends. All great Mini|&s;ters, without either private or oeconomical Virtue, are <HI>virtuous</HI> by their <HI>Po&s;ts;</HI> liberal and generous upon the <HI>Publick Money,</HI> provident upon <HI>Pub|lick Supplies,</HI> ju&s;t by paying <HI>Publick Intere&s;t,</HI> cou|ragious and magnanimous by the <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Ar|mies,</HI> magnificent upon the <HI>Publick Expences,</HI> and prudent by <HI>Publick Succe&s;s.</HI> They have by their Office, a right to a &s;hare of the <HI>Publick Stock</HI> of Virtues; be&s;ides they are by <HI>Pre&s;cription im|memorial</HI> inve&s;ted in all the celebrated virtues of their <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors</HI> in the &s;ame &s;tations, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of their own Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>As to what are commonly called the <HI>Colours</HI> of <HI>Honourable</HI> and <HI>Di&s;honourable,</HI> they are various in different Countries: In this they are <HI>Blue, Green,</HI> and <HI>Red.</HI></P>
<P>But fora&s;much as the duty we owe to the Pub|lick doth often require that we &s;hould put &s;ome things in a &s;trong light, and throw a &s;hade over others, I &s;hall explain the method of turning a vi|cious Man into a Hero.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and chief rule is the <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of <HI>Transformation,</HI> which con&s;i&#38;;sts in converting Vices into their bordering Virtues. A Man who is a Spendthrift, and will not pay a ju&s;t Debt, may have his Inju&s;tice <HI>transformed</HI> into Liberality; Cowardice may be metamorpho&s;ed into Prudence; Intemperance into good Nature and good Fellow|&s;hip;
<PB N="257" REF="262">
Corruption into Patrioti&s;m; and Lewdne&s;s into Tenderne&s;s and Facility.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the <HI>Rule of Contraries:</HI> It is cer|tain, the le&s;s a Man is endued with any Virtue, the more need he has to have it plentifully be&s;towed, e&s;pecially tho&s;e good qualities of which the world generally believes he hath none at all: For who will thank a Man for giving him that which he <HI>has?</HI></P>
<P>The Rever&s;e of the&s;e Precepts will &s;erve for <HI>Sa|tire,</HI> wherein we are ever to remark, that who&s;e lo&s;eth his place, or becomes out of favour with the Government, hath forfeited his &s;hare in <HI>publick Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI> Therefore the truly publick &s;pirited writer ought in duty to &s;trip him whom the government hath &s;tripped; which is the real <HI>poetical Ju&s;tice</HI> of this age.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Receipt to make an Epic Poem.</HEAD>
<P>AN Epic Poem, the Critics agree, is the greate&s;t work human nature is capable of. They have already laid down many mechanical rules for compo&s;itions of this &s;ort, but at the &s;ame time they cut off almo&s;t all undertakers from the po&s;&s;ibility of ever performing them; for the fir&s;t qualification they unanimou&s;ly require in a Poet, is a <HI>Genius.</HI> I &s;hall here endeavour (for the benefit of my Countrymen) to make it manife&s;t, that Epic Poems may be made <HI>without a Genius,</HI> nay with|out Learning or much Reading. This mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be of great u&s;e to all tho&s;e who confe&s;s they never <HI>Read,</HI> and of whom the world is con|vinced they never <HI>Learn.</HI> Moliere ob&s;erves of making a dinner, that any man can do it with <HI>Money,</HI> and if a profe&s;&s;ed Cook cannot do it with|out, he has his Art for nothing; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of making a Poem, 'tis ea&s;ily brought about by him that has a <HI>Genius,</HI> but the &s;kill lies in do|ing it without one. In pur&s;uance of this end, I &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with a plain and certain <HI>Recipe,</HI> by which any author in the Bathos may be qualified for this grand performance.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="259" REF="264">
<HEAD>For the FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>Take out of any old Poem, Hi&s;tory-book, Ro|mance, or Legend (for in&s;tance, <HI>Geoffry of Mon|mouth,</HI> or <HI>Don Belianis of Greece)</HI> tho&s;e parts of &s;tory which afford mo&s;t &s;cope for <HI>long De&s;crip|tions:</HI> Put the&s;e pieces together, and throw all the adventures you fancy into <HI>one Tale.</HI> Then take a Hero, whom you may chu&s;e for the &s;ound of his name, and put him into the mid&s;t of the&s;e adven|tures: There let him <HI>work</HI> for twelve books; at the end of which you may take him out, ready prepared to <HI>conquer</HI> or to <HI>marry;</HI> it being nece&s;|&s;ary that the conclu&s;ion of an Epic Poem be <HI>for|tunate.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To make an EPISODE.</HEAD>
<P>Take any remaining adventure of your former collection, in which you could no way involve your Hero; or any unfortunate accident that was too good to be thrown away; and it will be of u&s;e, applied to any other per&s;on, who may be lo&s;t and <HI>evaporate</HI> in the cour&s;e of the work, without the lea&s;t damage to the compo&s;ition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the MORAL and ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e you may extract out of the Fable after|wards, at your lei&s;ure: Be &s;ure you <HI>&s;train</HI> them &s;ufficiently.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="260" REF="265">
<HEAD>For the MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>For tho&s;e of the Hero, take all the be&s;t quali|lities you can find in the mo&s;t celebrated Heroes of antiquity; if they will not be reduced to a <HI>Con|&s;i&s;tency,</HI> lay them <HI>all on a heap</HI> upon him. But be &s;ure they are qualities which your <HI>Patron</HI> would be thought to have; and to prevent any mi&s;take which the world may be &s;ubject to, &s;elect from the al|phabet tho&s;e capital letters that compo&s;e his name, and &s;et them at the head of a Dedication before your Poem. However, do not ab&s;olutely ob&s;erve the exact quantity of the&s;e Virtues, it not being determined whether or no it be nece&s;&s;ary for the Hero of a Poem to be an <HI>hone&s;t Man.</HI> For the <HI>Under-Characters,</HI> gather them from Homer and Virgil, and change the names as occa&s;ion &s;erves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the MACHINES.</HEAD>
<P>Take of <HI>Deities,</HI> male and female, as many as you can u&s;e: Separate them into two equal parts, and keep Jupiter in the middle; Let Juno put him in a ferment, and Venus mollify him. Remem|ber on all occa&s;ions to make u&s;e of volatile Mer|cury. If you have need of <HI>Devils,</HI> draw them out of Milton's Paradi&s;e, and extract your <HI>Spirits</HI> from Ta&s;&s;o. The u&s;e of the&s;e Machines is evident; &s;ince no Epic Poem can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them, the wi&s;e&s;t way is to re&s;erve them for your greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities: When you cannot extricate
<PB N="261" REF="266">
your Hero by any human means, or your&s;elf by your own wit, &s;eek relief from Heaven, and the Gods will do your bu&s;ine&s;s very readily. This is according to the direct Pre&s;cription of Horace in his Art of Poetry,
<Q><L>Nec Deus inter&s;it, ni&s;i dignus vindice <HI>Nodus</HI></L>
<L>Inciderit.&mdash;</L></Q>
That is to &s;ay, <HI>A Poet &s;hould never call upon the Gods for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but when he is in great Perplexity.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the DESCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>For a <HI>Tempe&s;t.</HI> Take Eurus, Zephyr, Au&s;ter, and Boreas, and ca&s;t them together in one ver&s;e: add to the&s;e of Rain, Lightning and Thunder (the loude&s;t you can) <HI>quantum &s;ufficit:</HI> mix your Clouds and Billows well together 'till they foam, and thicken your De&s;cription here and there with a Quick&s;and. Brew your Tempe&s;t well in your head, before you &s;et it a blowing.</P>
<P>For a <HI>Battle.</HI> Pick a large quantity of Images and De&s;criptions from Homer's Iliads, with a &s;pice or two of Virgil, and if there remain any over|plus, you may lay them by for a <HI>Skirmi&s;h.</HI> Sea|&s;on it well with <HI>Similes,</HI> and it will make an ex|cellent Battle.</P>
<P>For a <HI>Burning Town.</HI> If &s;uch a De&s;cription be nece&s;&s;ary (becau&s;e it is certain there is one in
<PB N="262" REF="267">
Virgil) old Troy is ready burnt to your hands. But if you fear that would be thought borrowed, a Chapter or two of the Theory of the <HI>Conflagra|tion,</HI> well circum&s;tanced and done into ver&s;e, will be a good <HI>Succedaneum.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Similes</HI> and <HI>Metaphors,</HI> they may be found all over the Creation; the mo&s;t ignorant may <HI>gather</HI> them, but the difficulty is in <HI>applying</HI> them. For this advi&s;e with your <HI>Book&s;eller.</HI></P>

<P>IT may be thought that we &s;hould not wholly omit the <HI>Drama,</HI> which makes &s;o great and &s;o lucrative a part of Poetry. But this Province is &s;o well taken care of, by the pre&s;ent <HI>Managers</HI> of the Theatre, that it is perfectly needle&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t to them any other Methods than they have already practi&s;ed for the advancement of the Bathos.</P>
<P>Here therefore, in the Name of all our Bre|thren, let me return our &s;incere and humble Thanks to the mo&s;t Augu&s;t Mr. Barton Booth, the mo&s;t Serene Mr. Robert Wilks, and the mo&s;t Undaunted Mr. Colly Cibber; of whom let it be

paces &s;quare, and &s;eparate divi&s;ions for the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, my Lords the Judges, the honourable the Directors of the Academy, and the Court of Aldermen, who &s;hall all have their Places frank.</P>
<P N="3">3. If <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> be not allotted to this &s;er|vice (which by rea&s;on of its proximity to the two Chambers of Parliament above-mentioned, &s;eems not altogether improper;) it is left to the wi&s;dom of the Nation whether <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e</HI> may not be demoli&s;hed, and a Theatre built upon that Site, which lies convenient to receive Spectators from the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> who may be wafted thither by water-carriage, e&s;teemed by all Projectors the cheape&s;t what&s;oever.

<P N="4">4.

<P>Littleton, Sect. 315. &s;aith, If Tenants in Com|mon make a Lea&s;e re&s;erving for Rent a Hor&s;e, they &s;hall have but one A&s;&s;ize, becau&s;e, &s;aith the Book, the Law will not &s;uffer a Hor&s;e to be &s;e|vered. Another Argument of what high E&s;tima|tion the Law maketh of an Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>But as the great difference &s;eemeth not to be &s;o much touching the &s;ub&s;tantial Part, Hor&s;es, let us proceed to the formal or de&s;criptive Part, viz. What Hor&s;es they are that come within this Beque&s;t.</P>
<P>Colours are commonly of various Kinds and different Sorts; of which White and Black are the
<PB N="284" REF="289">
two Extremes, and con&s;equently comprehend within them all other Colours what&s;oever.</P>
<P>By a Reque&s;t therefore of black and white Hor&s;es, grey or pyed Hor&s;es may well pa&s;s; for when two Extremes, or remote&s;t Ends, of any thing are devi&s;ed, the Law, by common Intend|ment, will intend what&s;oever is contained between them to be devi&s;ed too.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is &s;till &s;tronger, coming not only within the Intendment, but al&s;o the very Letter of the Words.</P>
<P>By the Word Black, all the Hor&s;es that are black are devi&s;ed; by the Word White, are de|vi&s;ed tho&s;e that are White; and by the &s;ame Word, with the Conjunction Copulative, And, between them, the Hor&s;es that are Black and White, that is to &s;ay, Pyed, are devi&s;ed al&s;o.</P>
<P>Whatever is Black and White is Pyed, and whatever is Pyed is Black and White; <HI>ergo,</HI> Black and White is Pyed, and, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> Pyed is Black and White,</P>
<P>If therefore Black and White Hor&s;es are de|vi&s;ed, Pyed Hor&s;es &s;hall pa&s;s by &s;uch Devi&s;e; but Black and White Hor&s;es are devi&s;ed; <HI>ergo,</HI> the Pl. &s;hall have the Pyed Hor&s;es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pour le Defend.</NOTE> Catlyne Serjeant, May $emble a$' contrary, The Plaintiff &s;hall not have the Pyed Hor&s;es by Intendment; for if by
<PB N="285" REF="290">
the devi&s;e of Black and White Hor&s;es, not only black and white Hor&s;es, but Hor&s;es of any Co|lour, between the&s;e two Extremes may pa&s;s, then not only Pyed and Grey Hor&s;es, but al&s;o Red or Bay Hor&s;es would pa&s;s likewi&s;e, which would be ab&s;urd, and again&s;t Rea&s;on. And this is ano|ther &s;trong Argument in Law, <HI>Nihil, quod e&s;t contra rationem, e&s;t licitum;</HI> for Rea&s;on is the Life of the Law, nay the common Law is nothing but Rea&s;on; which is to be under&s;tood of artificial Perfection and Rea&s;on gotten by long Study, and not of Man's natural Rea&s;on; for <HI>nemo na&s;citur ar|tifex,</HI> and legal Rea&s;on <HI>e&s;t &s;umma ratio;</HI> and there|fore if all the Rea&s;on that is di&s;per&s;ed into &s;o many different Heads, were united into one, he could not make &s;uch a Law as the Law of Eng|land; becau&s;e by many Succe&s;&s;ions of Ages it has been fired and refired by grave and learned Men; &s;o that the old Rule may be verified in it, <HI>Neminem oportet e&s;&s;e legibus &s;apientiorem.</HI></P>
<P>As therefore pyed Hor&s;es do not come within the Intendment of the Beque$$, &s;o neither do they within the Letter of the Words.</P>
<P>A pyed Hor&s;e is not a white Hor&s;e, neither is a pyed a black Hor&s;e; how then can pyed Hor&s;es come under the Words of black and white Hor&s;es?</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS of P. P. CLERK of this PARISH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Original of the following extraordinary Treati&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of two large Volumes in Folio; which might ju&s;tly be intitled, <HI>The Importance of a Man to him&s;elf:</HI> But, as it can be of very little to any body be&s;ides, I have contented my&s;elf to give only this &s;hort Ab&s;tract of it, as a Ta&s;te of the <HI>true Spirit of Memoir-Writers.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of the Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI> I, P. P. by the Grace of God, Clerk of this Pari&s;h, writeth this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I arrived at the age of di&s;cretion, I had a call to take upon me the function of a Pa|ri&s;h-cletk; and to that end, it &s;eemed unto me meet and profitable to a&s;&s;ociate my&s;elf with the pari&s;h-clerks of this Land; &s;uch I mean, as were right worthy in their calling, men of a clear and &s;weet voice, and of becoming gravity.</P>
<P>Now it came to pa&s;s, that I was born in the year of our Lord <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1655, the year wherein our worthy benefactor, E&s;quire <HI>Bret,</HI> did add one Bell to the ring of this Pari&s;h. So that
<PB N="288" REF="293">
it hath been wittily &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;That one and the &s;ame day did give to this our Church two rare gifts, its great Bell and its Clerk.</Q></P>
<P>Even when I was at &s;chool, my mi&s;tre&s;s did ever extol me above the re&s;t of the youth, in that I had a laudable voice. And it was further-more ob&s;erved, that I took a kindly affection unto that Black letter in which our Bibles are printed. Yea, often did I exerci&s;e my&s;elf in &s;inging godly bal|lads, &s;uch as <HI>The Lady and Death, The Children in the Wood,</HI> and <HI>Chevy-Chace;</HI> and not, like other children, in lewd and trivial ditties. More|over, while I was a boy, I always adventured to lead the p&s;alm next after Ma&s;ter William Harris, my predece&s;&s;or, who (it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to the Glory of God) was a mo&s;t excellent Pari&s;h-clerk in that his day.</P>
<P>Yet be it acknowledged, that at the age of &s;ix|teen I became a Company-keeper, being led into idle conver&s;ation by my extraordinary love to Ring|ing; in&s;omuch, that in a &s;hort time I was ac|quainted with every &s;ett of bells in the whole country: Neither could I be prevailed upon to ab&s;ent my&s;elf from Wakes, being called thereunto by the harmony of the &s;teeple. While I was in the&s;e &s;ocieties, I gave my&s;elf up to un&s;piritual pa&s;times, &s;uch as wre&s;tling, dancing, and cudgell|playing; &s;o that I often returned to my father's hou&s;e with a broken pate. I had my head broken at Milton by Thomas Wyat, as we played a bout
<PB N="289" REF="294">
or two for an Hat that was edged with &s;ilver gal|loon. But in the year following I broke the head of Henry Stubbs, and obtained an hat not inferior to the former. At Yelverton I encountred George Cummins, Weaver, and behold my head was broken a &s;econd time! At the wake of Waybrook I engaged William Simkins, Tanner, when lo! thus was my head broken a third time, and much blood trickled therefrom. But I admini&s;tred to my comfort, &s;aying within my&s;elf, <Q>&startq;What man is there, how&s;oever dextrous in any craft, who is for aye on his guard?&endq;</Q> A week after I had a ba&s;e-born child laid unto me; for in the days of my youth I was looked upon as a follower of ve|nereal fanta&s;ies: Thus was I led into &s;in by the comeline&s;s of Su&s;anna Smith, who fir&s;t tempted me and then put me to &s;hame; for indeed &s;he was a maiden of a &s;educing eye, and plea&s;ant feature. I humbled my&s;elf before the Ju&s;tice, I acknowledg|ed my crime to our Curate; and to do away mine offences and make her &s;ome attonement, was joined to her in holy wedlock on the &s;abbath day following.</P>
<P>How often do tho&s;e things which &s;eem unto us misfortunes, redound to our advantage! For the Mini&s;ter (who had long look'd on Su&s;anna as the mo&s;t lovely of his pari&s;hioners) liked &s;o well of my demeanour, that he recommended me to the honour of being his Clerk, which was then
<PB N="290" REF="295">
become vacant by the decea&s;e of good Ma&s;ter Wil|liam Harris.</P>
<P>Here ends the fir&s;t chapter; after which follow fifty or &s;ixty pages of his amours in general, and that particular one with Su&s;anna his pre&s;ent Wife; but I proceed to chapter the ninth.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I elected into mine office, but I layed a&s;ide the powder'd gallantries of my youth, and became a new man. I con&s;idered my&s;elf as in &s;ome wi&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, &s;ince by wear|ing a band, which is no &s;mall part of the orna|ment of our Clergy, I might not unworthily be deemed, as it were, a &s;hred of the linen ve&s;tment of Aaron.</P>
<P>Thou may'&s;t conceive, O reader, with what concern I perceived the eyes of the congregation fixed upon me, when I fir&s;t took my place at the feet of the Prie&s;t. When I rai&s;ed the p&s;alm, how did my voice quaver for fear! And when I array'd the &s;houlders of the Mini&s;ter with the &s;urplice, how did my joints tremble under me! I &s;aid within my&s;elf, <Q>&startq;Remember, Paul, thou &s;tande&s;t before men of high wor&s;hip, the wi&s;e Mr. Ju&s;|tice Freeman, the grave Mr. Ju&s;tice Ton&s;on, the good Lady Jones, and the two virtuous gen|tlewomen her daughters, nay the great Sir Tho|mas Truby, Knight and Baronet, and my young ma&s;ter the E&s;quire, who &s;hall one day be Lord of this Manor:&endq;</Q> Notwith&s;tanding which, it was
<PB N="291" REF="296">
my good hap to acquit my&s;elf to the good liking of the whole congregation; but the Lord forbid I &s;hould glory therein.</P>
<P>The next chapter contains an account how he di&s;|charged the &s;everal duties of his office; in particular be in&s;i&s;ts on the following:</P>
<P>I was determined to reform the manifold Cor|ruptions and Abu&s;es which had crept into the Church.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I was e&s;pecially &s;evere in whipping forth dogs from the Temple, all excepting the lap-dog of the good widow Howard, a &s;ober dog which yelped not, nor was there offence in his mouth.</P>
<P>Secondly, I did even proceed to moro&s;ene&s;s, tho' &s;ore again&s;t my heart, unto poor babes, in tear|ing from them the half-eaten apples which they privily munch'd at Church. But verily it pity'd me, for I remember'd the days of my youth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, With the &s;weat of my own hands, I did make plain and &s;mooth the dogs-ears through|out our great Bible.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The pews and benches which were formerly &s;wept but once in three years, I caus'd every Saturday to be &s;wept with a be&s;om and trimmed.</P>
<P>Fifthly and la&s;tly, I cau&s;ed the &s;urplice to be neatly darned, wa&s;hed, and laid in fre&s;h lavender, (yea, and &s;ometimes to be &s;prinkled with ro&s;e|water) and I had great laud and prai&s;e from all
<PB N="292" REF="297">
the neighbouring Clergy, fora&s;much as no pari&s;h kept the Mini&s;ter in cleaner linen.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e his publick cares, in the eleventh chapter he informs us he did not neglect his u&s;ual occupations as a handy-craft&s;man.</P>
<P>Shoes, &s;aith he, did I make, (and, if intreated, mend) with good approbation. Faces al&s;o did I &s;have, and I clipped the hair. Chirurgery al&s;o I practi&s;ed in the worming of Dogs; but to bleed adventured I not, except the poor. Upon this my twofold profe&s;&s;ion, there pa&s;&s;ed among men a mer|ry tale delectable enough to be rehear&s;ed: How that being overtaken with liquor one Saturday evening, I &s;hav'd the Prie&s;t with Spani&s;h blacking for &s;hoes in&s;tead of a wa&s;hball, and with lamp|black powdered his perriwig. But the&s;e were &s;ay|ings of men, delighting in their own conceits more than in the truth. For it is well known, that great was my care and &s;kill in the&s;e my crafts; yea, I once had the honour of trimming Sir Tho|mas him&s;elf, without fetching blood. Further|more, I was &s;ought unto to geld the Lady Frances her &s;paniel, which was wont to go a&s;tray: He was called Toby, that is to &s;ay, Tobias. And 3dly, I was entru&s;ted with a gorgeous pair of &s;hoes of the &s;aidLady, to &s;et an heel-piece thereon; and I received &s;uch prai&s;e therefore, that it was &s;aid all over the pari&s;h, I &s;hould be recommended unto the King
<PB N="293" REF="298">
to mend &s;hoes for his Maje&s;ty: whom God pre|&s;erve! Amen.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this chapter I purpo&s;ely omit, for it mu&s;t be own'd that when he &s;peaks as a Shoemaker he is very ab&s;urd. He talks of Mo&s;es's pulling off his <HI>&s;hoes,</HI> of tanning the <HI>hides</HI> of the Bulls of Ba&s;an, of Simon the <HI>Tanner,</HI> etc. and takes up four or five pages to prove, that, when the Apo&s;tles were in&s;truct|ed to travel <HI>without &s;hoes,</HI> the precept did not ex|tend to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The next chapter relates how he di&s;cover'd a Thief with a bible and key, and experimented ver&s;es of the P&s;alms that had cured Agues.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over many others which inform us of pari&s;h affairs only, &s;uch as of the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Curates;</HI> a li&s;t of the <HI>weekly Texts;</HI> what <HI>P&s;alms</HI> he cho&s;e on proper occa&s;ions; and what Children were <HI>born</HI> and <HI>bury'd:</HI> The la&s;t of which articles he concludes thus:</P>
<P>That the &s;hame of women may not endure, I &s;peak not of Ba&s;tards; neither will I name the Mo|thers, although thereby I might delight many grave women of the pari&s;h: Even her who hath done penance in the &s;heet will I not mention, fora&s;much as the church hath been witne&s;s of her di&s;grace: Let the father, who hath made due compo&s;ition with the Churchwardens to conceal
<PB N="294" REF="299">
his infirmity, re&s;t in peace; my pen &s;hall not be|wray him, for I al&s;o have &s;inned.</P>
<P>The next chapter contains what he calls a great Revolution in the Church, part of which I tran|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Now was the long expected time arrived, when the p&s;alms of King David &s;hould be hymn'd unto the &s;ame tunes to which he played them upon his harp; (&s;o was I inform'd by my Singing-ma&s;ter, a man right cunning in P&s;almody:) Now was our over-abundant quaver and trilling done away, and in lieu thereof was in&s;tituted the Sol-fa, in &s;uch gui&s;e as is &s;ung in his Maje&s;ty's Chapel. We had London &s;inging ma&s;ters &s;ent into every pari&s;h, like unto Exci&s;e-men; and I al&s;o was ordained to ad|join my&s;elf unto them, though an unworthy di&s;|ciple, in order to in&s;truct my fellow-pari&s;hioners in this new manner of Wor&s;hip. What tho' they accu&s;ed me of humming through the no&s;tril, as a Sacbut? yet would I not forego that harmony, it having been agreed by the worthy pari&s;h-clerks of London &s;till to pre&s;erve the &s;ame. I tutored the young men and maidens to tune their voices as it were a p&s;altery, and the Church on the Sunday was filled with the&s;e new Hallelujahs.</P>
<P>Then follow full &s;eventy chapters, containing an exact detail of the <HI>Law-&s;uits</HI> of the Par&s;on and his Pari&s;hioners concerning tythes, and near a hundred
<PB N="295" REF="300">
pages left blank, with an earne&s;t de&s;ire that the <HI>hi&s;|tory might be compleated by any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in who&s;e time the&s;e &s;uits &s;hould be ended.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next chapter contains an account of the Briefs read in the church, and the &s;ums collected upon each.</HI> For the reparation of nine churches, collected at nine &s;everal times, 2s. and 7d. &frac34;. For fifty fami|lies ruined by fire, 1s. &frac12;. For an inundation, a King Charles's groat given by Lady Frances, etc.</P>
<P><HI>In the next he laments the di&s;u&s;e of Wedding-&s;er|mons, and celebrates the benefits ari&s;ing from tho&s;e at Funerals, concluding with the&s;e Words:</HI> Ah! let not the relations of the decea&s;ed grudge the &s;mall expence of an hatband, a pair of gloves, and ten &s;hillings, for the &s;atisfaction they are &s;ure to re|ceive from a pious Divine, that their father, bro|ther, or bo&s;om wife, are certainly in heaven.</P>
<P><HI>In another, he draws a panegyrick on one Mrs. Margaret Wilkins, but after great encomiums con|cludes, that, notwith&s;tanding all,</HI> &s;he was an un|profitable ve&s;&s;el, being a barren woman, and ne|ver once having furni&s;hed God's church with a chri&s;tening.</P>
<P>We find in another chapter, how he was much &s;tagger'd in his belief, and di&s;turbed in his con&s;cience, by an Oxford &s;cholar, who had proved to him by <HI>lo|gick, that Animals might have rational, nay, im|mortal</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="301">
<HI>mortal &s;ouls;</HI> but how he was again comforted with the reflection, <HI>that, if &s;o, they might be allowed chri&s;tian burial, and greatly augment the fees of the pari&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>In the two following chapters he is overpower'd with Vanity. We are told, how he was con&s;tantly admitted to all the fea&s;ts and banquets of the Church|officers, and the &s;peeches he there made for the good of the pari&s;h. How he gave hints to young Clergy|men to preach; but above all, how he gave a Text for the 30th of January, which occa&s;ioned a mo&s;t ex|cellent &s;ermon, the merits of which he takes entirely to him&s;elf. He gives an account of a conference he had with the Vicar concerning the U&s;e of Texts. <HI>Let a preacher (&s;aith he) con&s;ider the a&s;&s;embly before whom he preacheth, and unto them adapt his text.</HI> Micah <HI>the iii^d and 11th affordeth good mat|ter for Courtiers and court-&s;erving men.</HI> The heads of the land judge for reward; and the people there|of judge for hire; and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and &s;ay, Is not the Lord among us? <HI>Were the fir&s;t Mi|ni&s;ter to appoint a preacher before the Hou&s;e of Commons, would not he be wi&s;e to make choice of the&s;e words?</HI> Give, and it &s;hall be give unto ye. <HI>Or before the Lords,</HI> Giving no offence, that the Mini&s;try be not blamed, <HI>2 Cor. vi. 3. Or prai&s;ing the warm zeal of an Admini&s;tration,</HI> Who mak|eth his Mini&s;ters a flaming fire, <HI>P&s;alm civ. 4.</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="302">
<HI>We omit many other of his texts, as too te|dious.</HI></P>
<P>From this period, the &s;tyle of the book ri&s;es ex|tremely. Before the next chapter was pa&s;ted the Effigies of Dr. <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> and I found the oppo&s;ite page all on a foam with Politicks.</P>
<P>We are now (&s;ays he) arrived at that celebrat|ed year, in which the Church of England was tried in the per&s;on of Dr. Sacheverel. I had ever the intere&s;t of our High-Church at heart, neither would I at any &s;ea&s;on mingle my&s;elf in the &s;ocie|ties of Fanaticks, whom I from my infancy ab|horred, more than the Heathen or Gentile. It was in the&s;e days I bethought my&s;elf, that much profit might accrue unto our Pari&s;h, and even un|to the Nation, could there be a&s;&s;embled together a number of cho&s;en men of the right &s;pirit, who might argue, refine and define, upon high and great matters. Unto this purpo&s;e, I did in&s;titute a weekly A&s;&s;embly of divers worthy men at the Ro&s;e and Crown Alehou&s;e, over whom my&s;elf (tho' unworthy) did pre&s;ide. Yea, I did read un|to them the Po&s;t-Boy of Mr. Roper, and the written letter of Mr. Dyer, upon which we com|muned afterwards among our&s;elves. Our &s;ociety was compo&s;ed of the following per&s;ons: Robert Jenkins, Farrier; Amos Turner, Collar-maker; George Pilcocks, late Exci&s;eman; Thomas White,
<PB N="298" REF="303">
Wheel-wright; and my&s;elf. Fir&s;t, of the fir&s;t, Robert Jenkins.</P>
<P>He was a man of bright parts and &s;hrewd con|ceit, for he never &s;hoed an hor&s;e of a Whig or a Fanatick, but he lamed him &s;orely.</P>
<P>Amos Turner, a worthy per&s;on, rightly e&s;teem|ed among us for his &s;ufferings, in that he had been honoured in the &s;tocks for wearing an Oaken bough.</P>
<P>George Pilcocks, a &s;ufferer al&s;o; of zealous and laudable freedom of Speech, in&s;omuch that his occupation had been taken from him.</P>
<P>Thomas White, of good repute likewi&s;e, for that his uncle, by the Mother's &s;ide, had, former|ly, been &s;ervitor at Maudlin college, where the glorious Sacheverel was educated.</P>
<P>Now were the eyes of all the pari&s;h upon the&s;e our weekly councils. In a &s;hort &s;pace, the Mi|ni&s;ter came among us; he &s;pake concerning us and our councils to a multitude of other Mini&s;ters at the Vi&s;itation, and they &s;pake thereof unto the Mini&s;ters at London, &s;o that even the Bi&s;hops heard and marveled thereat. Moreover Sir Tho|mas, member of Parliament, &s;pake of the &s;ame to other members of Parliament; who &s;pake thereof unto the Peers of the Realm. Lo! thus did our coun&s;els enter into the hearts of our Generals and our Law-givers; and from henceforth, even as we devi&s;ed, thus did they.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="304">
After this, the whole book is turned on a &s;udden, from his own Life, to a Hi&s;tory of all the publick Tran&s;actions of Europe, compiled from the News|papers of tho&s;e times. I could not comprehend the meaning of this, till I perceived at la&s;t (to my no &s;mall A&s;toni&s;hment) that all the Mea&s;ures of the four la&s;t years of the <HI>Queen,</HI> together with the peace at <HI>Utrecht</HI> which have been u&s;ually attributed to the E&mdash;of O&mdash;, D&mdash;of O&mdash;, Lords H&mdash;and B&mdash;, and other great men; do here mo&s;t plainly appear, to have been wholly owing to Robert Jenkins, Amos Turner, George Pilcocks, Thomas White, but above all, P. P.</P>
<P>The reader may be &s;ure I was very inqui&s;itive af|ter this extraordinary writer, who&s;e work I have here ab&s;tracted. I took a journey into the Country on purpo&s;e; but could not find the lea&s;t trace of him: till by accident I met an old Clergyman, who &s;aid be could not be po&s;itive, but thought it might be one <HI>Paul Philips,</HI> who had beeen dead about twelve years. And upon enquiry, all he could learn of that per&s;on from the neighbourhood, was, That he had been taken notice of for <HI>&s;wallowing Loaches,</HI> and remembered by &s;ome people by a <HI>black and white Cur with one Ear,</HI> that con&s;tantly followed him.</P>
<P>In the Church-yard, I read his Epitaph, &s;aid to be written by him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE POET LAUREATE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">November 19, 1729.</HEAD>
<P>THE time of the election of a Poet Laureate being now at hand, it may be proper to give &s;ome account of the <HI>rites</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> an|ciently u&s;ed at that Solemnity, and only di&s;conti|nued through the neglect and degeneracy of later times. The&s;e we have extracted from an hi&s;to|rian of undoubted credit, a reverend bi&s;hop, the learned Paulus Jovius; and are the &s;ame that were practi&s;ed under the pontificate of Leo X, the great re&s;torer of learning.</P>
<P>As we now &s;ee an <HI>age</HI> and a <HI>court,</HI> that for the encouragement of poetry rivals, if not exceeds, that of this famous Pope, we cannot but wi&s;h a re&s;toration of all its <HI>honours</HI> to <HI>poe&s;y;</HI> the rather, &s;ince there are &s;o many parallel circum&s;tances in the <HI>per&s;on</HI> who was then honoured with the laurel, and in <HI>him,</HI> who (in all probability) is now to wear it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall tran&s;late my author exactly as I find it in the 82d chapter of his Elogia Vir. Doct. He be|gins
<PB N="302" REF="307">
with the character of the poet him&s;elf, who was the original and father of all Laureates, and called Camillo. He was a plain country-man of Apulia, (whether a <HI>&s;hepherd</HI> or <HI>thre&s;her,</HI> is not ma|terial.) "This man (&s;ays Jovius) excited by the <Q>&startq;&endq;fame of the great encouragement given to poets at court, and the high honour in which they were held, came to the city, bringing with him a &s;trange kind of lyre in his hand, and at lea&s;t &s;ome <HI>twenty thou&s;and of ver&s;es.</HI> All the wits and critics of the court flocked about him, de|lighted to &s;ee a <HI>clown,</HI> with a ruddy, hale com|plexion, and in his own long hair, &s;o top full of poetry; and at the fir&s;t &s;ight of him all agreed he was born to be <HI>Poet Laureate</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Apulus praepingui vultu alacer, et prolixe comatus, omni|no dignus &s;e&s;ta laurea videretur.</NOTE>. He had a mo&s;t hearty welcome in an <HI>i&s;land</HI> of the river Tiber (an agreeable place, not unlike our Rich|mond) where he was fir&s;t made to <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink plentifully,</HI> and <HI>to repeat his ver&s;es to every body.</HI> Then they adorned him with a new and elegant garland, compo&s;ed of <HI>vine-leaves, lau|rel,</HI> and <HI>bra&s;&s;ica</HI> (a &s;ort of cabbage) &s;o compo&s;ed, &s;ays my author, emblematically, <HI>Ut tam &s;ales quam lepide ejus temulentia, bra&s;&s;icae remedio cohibenda, notaretur.</HI> He was then &s;aluted by common con&s;ent with the title of <HI>archi-poeta,</HI> or <HI>arch-poet,</HI> in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e days, in ours, <HI>Poet Laureate.</HI> This honour the poor man received
<PB N="303" REF="308">
with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible demon&s;trations of joy, his eyes drunk with tears and gladne&s;s <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Manantibus prae gaudio oculis.</NOTE>. Next, the public acclamation was expre&s;&s;ed in a <HI>canticle,</HI> which is tran&s;mitted to us, as follows:</Q></P>
<LG>
<L>Salve, bra&s;&s;icea virens corona,</L>
<L>Et lauro, archipoeta, pampinoque!</L>
<L>Dignus principis auribus Leonis.</L>
<L>All hail, arch-poet without peer!</L>
<L>Vine, bay, or cabbage, fit to wear,</L>
<L>And worthy of the <HI>prince's ear.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>From hence, he was conducted in pomp to the <HI>Capitol</HI> of Rome, mounted on an <HI>elephant,</HI> thro' the &s;houts of the populace, where the ceremony ended.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torian tells us further, <Q>&startq;That at his in|troduction to Leo, he not only poured forth ver&s;es innumerable, like a torrent, but al&s;o <HI>&s;ung</HI> them with <HI>open mouth.</HI> Nor was he only <HI>once</HI> introduced, or on <HI>&s;tated</HI> days (like our Lau|reates) but made a <HI>companion</HI> to his <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> and entertained as one of the in&s;truments of his <HI>mo&s;t elegant plea&s;ures.</HI> When the prince was at ta|ble, the poet had his place at the window. When the prince had <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Seme&s;is op&s;oniis.</NOTE>half eaten his meat, he gave with his own hands the re&s;t to the poet. When the poet drank, it was out of the prince's own flaggon, in&s;omuch (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) that
<PB N="304" REF="309">
thro' &s;o great good eating and drinking he con|tracted a mo&s;t terrible guot.&endq;</Q> Sorry I am to relate what follows, but that I cannot leave my reader's curio&s;ity un&s;atisfied in the cata&s;trophe of this extraordinary man. To u&s;e my author's words, which are remarkable, <HI>mortuo Leone, pro|fligati&s;que poetis, etc.</HI> <Q>&startq;When Leo died, and poets were no more&endq;</Q> (for I would not under|&s;tand <HI>profligatis</HI> literally, as if poets then were <HI>pro|fligate)</HI> this unhappy Laureate was forthwith re|duced to return to his country, where, oppre&s;&s;ed with <HI>old age</HI> and <HI>want,</HI> he mi&s;erably peri&s;hed in a <HI>common ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee from this &s;ad conclu&s;ion (which may be of example to the poets of our time) that it were happier to meet with no encouragement at all, to remain at the plough, or other lawful oc|cupation, than to be elevated above their condi|tion, and taken out of the common means of life, without a &s;urer &s;upport than the <HI>temporary,</HI> or at be&s;t, <HI>mortal</HI> favours of the great. It was doubt|le&s;s for this con&s;ideration, that when the Royal Bounty was lately extended to a <HI>rural genius,</HI> care was taken to <HI>&s;ettle it upon him for life.</HI> And it hath been the practice of our Princes, never to re|move from the &s;tation of Poet Laureate any man who hath once been cho&s;en, tho' never &s;o much greater Genius's might ari&s;e in his time. A noble in&s;tance, how much the <HI>charity</HI> of our monarchs hath exceeded their <HI>love of fame.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="310">
To come now to the intent of this paper. We have here the whole ancient <HI>ceremonial</HI> of the Lau|reate. In the fir&s;t place the crown is to be mixed with <HI>vine-leaves,</HI> as the vine is the plant of Bac|chus, and full as e&s;&s;ential to the honour, as the <HI>butt of &s;ack</HI> to the &s;alary.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>bra&s;&s;ica</HI> mu&s;t be made u&s;e of as a qualifier of the former. It &s;eems the <HI>cabbage</HI> was anciently accounted a remedy for <HI>drunkenne&s;s;</HI> a power the French now a&s;cribe to the onion, and &s;tyle a &s;oup made of it, <HI>&s;oupe d' Yurogne.</HI> I would recommend a large mixture of the <HI>bra&s;&s;ica,</HI> if Mr. Dennis be cho&s;en; but if Mr. Tibbald, it is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s the cabbage be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ig|nify the &s;ame thing with re&s;pect to <HI>poets</HI> as to <HI>tay|lors,</HI> viz. <HI>&s;tealing.</HI> I &s;hould judge it not ami&s;s to add another plant to this garland, to wit, <HI>ivy:</HI> Not only as it anciently belonged to poets in gene|ral; but as it is emblematical of the three virtues of a court poet in particular; it is <HI>creeping, dirty,</HI> and <HI>dangling.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, a <HI>canticle</HI> mu&s;t be compo&s;ed and &s;ung in laud and prai&s;e of the new Poet. If Mr. CIBBER be laureated, it is my opinion no man can <HI>write</HI> this but him&s;elf: And no man, I am &s;ure, can <HI>&s;ing</HI> it &s;o affectingly. But what this can|ticle &s;hould be, either in his or the other candi|date's ca&s;e, I &s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there ought to be a <HI>public &s;how,</HI> or <HI>entry</HI> of the poet: To &s;ettle the order or proce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="306" REF="311">
of which, Mr. An&s;tis and Mr. DENNIS ought to have a conference. I apprehend here two diffi|culties: One, of procuring an <HI>elephant;</HI> the other of teaching the poet to ride him: Therefore I &s;hould imagine the next animal in &s;ize or dignity would do be&s;t; either a <HI>mule</HI> or a large <HI>a&s;s;</HI> par|ticularly if that noble one could be had, who&s;e portraiture makes &s;o great an ornament of the <HI>Dun|ciad,</HI> and which (unle&s;s I am mi&s;informed) is yet in the park of a nobleman near this city:&mdash;Unle&s;s Mr. CIBBER be the man; who may, with great propriety and beauty, ride on a <HI>dragon,</HI> if he goes by land; or if he choo&s;e the water, upon one of his own <HI>&s;wans</HI> from <HI>Cae&s;ar in Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;poken &s;ufficiently of the <HI>ceremony;</HI> let us now &s;peak of the <HI>qualifications</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of the Laureate. Fir&s;t, we &s;ee he mu&s;t be able to make ver&s;es <HI>extempore,</HI> and to pour forth innu|merable, if required. In this I doubt Mr. TIB|BALD. Secondly, he ought to <HI>&s;ing,</HI> and intre|pidly, <HI>patulo ore:</HI> Here, I confe&s;s the excellency of Mr. CIBBER. Thirdly, he ought to carry a <HI>lyre</HI> about with him: If a large one be thought too cumber&s;ome, a &s;mall one may be contrived to hang about the neck, like an order; and be very much a grace to the per&s;on. Fourthly, he ought to have a good <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> to eat and drink whatever his betters think fit; and therefore it is in this high office as in many others, no puny con&s;titution can di&s;charge it. I do not think CIB|BER
<PB N="307" REF="312">
or TIBBALD here &s;o happy: but rather a &s;tanch, vigorous, &s;ea&s;on'd, and dry <HI>old gentleman,</HI> whom I have in my eye.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o wi&s;h at this juncture, &s;uch a per|&s;on as is truly jealous of the <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>dignity</HI> of <HI>poetry;</HI> no joker, or trifler; but a bard in <HI>good earne&s;t;</HI> nay, not ami&s;s if a critic, and the better if a little <HI>ob&s;tinate.</HI> For when we con&s;ider what great privileges have been lo&s;t from this office (as we &s;ee from the fore-cited authentick record of jovius) namely tho&s;e of <HI>feeding</HI> from the <HI>prince's table, drinking</HI> out of his <HI>own flaggon,</HI> becoming even his <HI>dome&s;tick</HI> and <HI>companion;</HI> it requires a man warm and re&s;olute, to be able to claim and obtain the re&s;toring of the&s;e high honours. I have cau&s;e to fear, mo&s;t of the candidates would be liable, either through the influence of mini&s;ters, or for rewards or favours, to give up the glorious rights of the Laureate: Yet I am not without hopes, there is <HI>one,</HI> from whom a <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>&s;teddy</HI> a&s;&s;ertion of the&s;e privileges may be ex|pected; and, if there be &s;uch a one, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, it is Mr. DENNIS the wor|thy pre&s;ident of our &s;ociety.</P>

<P>THOUGH mo&s;t things which are wrong in their own nature are at once confe&s;&s;ed and ab&s;olved in that &s;ingle word, the Cu&s;tom; yet there are &s;ome, which as they have a dangerous tendency, a thinking man will the le&s;s excu&s;e on that very account. Among the&s;e I cannot but reckon the common practice of <HI>Dedications,</HI> which is of &s;o much the wor&s;e con&s;equence as tis gene|rally u&s;ed by people of politene&s;s, and whom a learned education for the mo&s;t part ought to have in&s;pired with nobler and ju&s;ter &s;entiments. This pro&s;titution of Prai&s;e is not only a deceit upon the gro&s;s of mankind, who take their notion of cha|racters from the Learned; but al&s;o the better &s;ort mu&s;t by this means lo&s;e &s;ome part at lea&s;t of that de&s;ire of Fame which is the incentive to generous actions, when they find it promi&s;cuou&s;ly be&s;towed on the meritorious and under&s;erving. Nay, the author him&s;elf, let him be &s;uppo&s;ed to have ever &s;o true a value for the patron, can find no terms
<PB N="309" REF="314">
to expre&s;s it, but what have been already u&s;ed, and rendered &s;u&s;pected by flatterers. Even Truth it&s;elf in a Dedication is like an hone&s;t man in a di&s;|gui&s;e or Vizor-Ma&s;que, and will appear a Cheat by being dre&s;t &s;o like one. Tho' the merit of the per&s;on is beyond di&s;pute, I &s;ee no rea&s;on, that, be|cau&s;e one man is eminent, therefore another has a right to be impertinent, and throw prai&s;es in his face. 'Tis ju&s;t the rever&s;e of the practi&s;e of the ancient Romans, when a per&s;on was advanced to triumph for his &s;ervices: they hired people to rail at him in that Circum&s;tance, to make him as humble as they could; and we have fellows to flatter him, and make him as proud as they can. Suppo&s;ing the writer not to be mercenary, yet the great man is no more in rea&s;on obliged to thank him for his picture in a Dedication, than to thank the painter for that on a &s;ign-po&s;t; except it be a le&s;s injury to touch the mo&s;t &s;acred part of him, his character, than to make free with his counte|nance only. I &s;hould think nothing ju&s;tified me in this point, but the patron's permi&s;&s;ion before|hand, that I &s;hould draw him as like as I could; whereas mo&s;t authors proceed in this affair ju&s;t as a dawber I have heard of, who, not being able to draw portraits after the life, was u&s;ed to paint faces at random, and look out afterwards for peo|ple whom he might per&s;uade to be like them. To expre&s;s my notion of the thing in a word: to &s;ay more to a man than one thinks, with a pro&s;|pect
<PB N="310" REF="315">
of intere&s;t, is di&s;hone&s;t; and without it, fool|i&s;h. And whoever has had &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch an un|dertaking, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity at once think him&s;elf in his heart a knave for having done it, and his patron a fool for having believed it.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes been entertained with con&s;i|dering Dedications in no very common light. By ob&s;erving what qualities our writers think it will be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to others to compliment them with, one may form &s;ome judgment which are mo&s;t &s;o to them&s;elves; and, in con&s;equence, what &s;ort of people they are. Without this view one can read very few Dedications, but will give us cau&s;e to wonder, either how &s;uch things came to be &s;aid at all, or how they were &s;aid to &s;uch per|&s;ons. I have known an Hero complimented upon the decent maje&s;ty and &s;tate he a&s;&s;umed after a victory; and a nobleman of a different character applauded for his conde&s;cen&s;ion to inferiors. This would have &s;eemed very &s;trange to me but that I happened to know the authors: He who made the fir&s;t compliment was a lofty gentleman, who&s;e air and gait di&s;covered when he had publi&s;hed a new book; and the other tippled every night with the fellows who laboured at the pre&s;s while his own writings were working off. 'Tis ob&s;ervable of the female poets and ladies dedicatory, that there (as el&s;ewhere) they far exceed us in any &s;train or rant. As beauty is the thing that &s;ex are piqu'd upon, they &s;peak of it generally in a more elevated
<PB N="311" REF="316">
&s;tyle than is u&s;ed by the men. They adore in the &s;ame manner as they would be adored. So when the authore&s;s of a famous modern romance begs a young Nobleman's permi&s;&s;ion to pay him her <HI>kneel|ing adorations,</HI> I am far from cen&s;uring the expre&s;|&s;ion, as &s;ome Criticks would do, as deficient in grammar or &s;en&s;e; but I reflect, that adorations paid in that po&s;ture are what a lady might expect her&s;elf, and my wonder immediately cea&s;es. The&s;e, when they flatter mo&s;t, do but as they would be done unto; for as none are &s;o much concerned at being injured by calumnies, as they who are rea|die&s;t to ca&s;t them upon their neighbours; &s;o, 'tis certain none are &s;o guilty of flattery to others, as tho&s;e who mo&s;t ardently de&s;ire it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>What led me into the&s;e thoughts, was a Dedi|cation I happened upon, this morning. The rea|der mu&s;t under&s;tand that I treat the lea&s;t in&s;tances or remains of ingenuity with re&s;pect, in what places &s;oever found, or under whatever circum|&s;tances of di&s;advantage. From this love to letters I have been &s;o happy in my &s;earches after know|ledge, that I have found unvalued repo&s;itories of learning in the lining of bandboxes. I look upon the&s;e pa&s;teboard edifices, adorned with the fragments of the ingenious, with the &s;ame venera|tion as antiquaries upon ruined buildings, who&s;e walls pre&s;erve divers in&s;criptions and names, which are no where el&s;e to be found in the world. This morning, when one of Lady Lizard's daughters
<PB N="312" REF="317">
was looking over &s;ome hoods and ribbands, brought by her tirewoman, with great care and diligence, I employed no le&s;s in examining the box which contained them; it was lined with certain &s;cenes of a tragedy, written (as appeared by a part of the title there extant) by one of the fair &s;ex. What was mo&s;t legible was the Dedication; which, by rea&s;on of the largene&s;s of the characters, was lea&s;t defaced by tho&s;e Gothick ornaments of flouri&s;hes and foliage, wherewith the compilers of the&s;e &s;ort of &s;tructures do often indu&s;triou&s;ly ob&s;cure the works of the learned. As much of it as I could read with any ea&s;e, I &s;hall communicate to the reader, as follows. *** <Q>&startq;Though it is a kind of prophanation to approach your Grace with &s;o poor an offering, yet when I reflect how accept|able a &s;acrifice of fir&s;t fruits was to Heaven, in the earlie&s;t and pure&s;t ages of religion, that they were honoured with &s;olemn fea&s;ts, and con&s;e|crated to altars by a Divine command; *** Upon that con&s;ideration, as an argument of particular zeal, I dedicate *** 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to behold you without adoring; yet dazzled and aw'd by the glory that &s;urrounds you, men feel a &s;acred power, that refines their flames, and renders them pure as tho&s;e we ought to offer to the Deity. **** The &s;hrine is worthy the divinity that inhabits it. In your Grace we &s;ee what woman was before &s;he fell, how nearly allied
<PB N="313" REF="318">
to the purity and perfection of Angels. And we adore and ble&s;s the glorious work!&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Undoubtedly the&s;e, and other periods of this mo&s;t pious Dedication, could not but convince the Duche&s;s of what the eloquent authore&s;s a&s;&s;ures her at the end, that &s;he was her &s;ervant with mo&s;t ardent devotion. I think this a pattern of a new &s;ort of &s;tyle, not yet taken notice of by the Cri|ticks, which is above the &s;ublime, and may be called the cele&s;tial; that is, when the mo&s;t &s;acred prai&s;es appropriated to the honour of the deity, are applied to a mortal of good quality. As I am na|turally emulous, I cannot but endeavour, in imi|tation of this Lady, to be the inventor, or, at lea&s;t, the fir&s;t producer of a new kind of Dedication, very different from hers and mo&s;t others, &s;ince it has not a word but what the author religiou&s;ly thinks in it. It may &s;erve for almo&s;t any book ei|ther Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e, that has, is, or &s;hall be pub|li&s;hed; and might run in this manner.</P>

practice it on both Sexes, of what Di&s;po&s;ition, Age, or Quality &s;oever, with Succe&s;s.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. I De&s;igned to have troubled the reader with no further di&s;cour&s;es of Pa&s;toral; but being informed that I am taxed of partiality in not men|tioning an Author who&s;e Eclogues are publi&s;hed in the &s;ame volume with Mr. Philips's, I &s;hall employ this paper in ob&s;ervations upon him, written in the free Spirit of Critici&s;m, and without any appre|hen&s;ion of offending that Gentleman, who&s;e cha|racter it is, that he takes the greate&s;t care of his works before they are publi&s;hed, and has the lea&s;t concern for them afterwards.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have laid it down as the fir&s;t rule of Pa&s;|toral, that its idea &s;hould be taken from the man|ners of the Golden Age, and the Moral formed upon the repre&s;entation of Innocence; 'tis there|fore plain that any deviations from that de&s;ign de|grade a Poem from being truly pa&s;toral. In this view it will appear, that Virgil can only have two of his Eclogues allowed to be &s;uch: his fir&s;t and ninth mu&s;t be rejected, becau&s;e they de&s;cribe the ravages of armies, and oppre&s;&s;ions of the innocent;
<PB N="322" REF="327">
Corydon's criminal pa&s;&s;ion for Alexis throws out the &s;econd; the calumny and railing in the third are not proper to that &s;tate of concord; the eighth repre&s;ents unlawful ways of procuring love by in|chantments, and introduces a &s;hepherd whom an inviting precipice tempts to &s;elf-murder: As to the fourth, &s;ixth, and tenth, they are given up by <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Rapin de Carm. par. iii.</NOTE>Hein&s;ius, Salma&s;ius, Rapin, and the criticks in general. They likewi&s;e ob&s;erve that but eleven of all the Idyllia of Theocritus are to admitted as pa&s;torals: and even out of that number the greater part will be excluded for one or other of the rea|&s;ons abovementioned. So that when I remarked in a former paper, that Virgil's eclogues, taken alto|gether, are rather Select poems than Pa&s;torals; I might have &s;aid the &s;ame thing with no le&s;s truth of Theocritus. The rea&s;on of this I take to be yet unob&s;erved by the criticks, viz. They never meant them all for pa&s;torals.</P>
<P>Now it is plain Philips hath done this, and in that particular excelled both Theocritus and Virgil.</P>
<P N="3">3. As Simplicity is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characte|ri&s;tick of Pa&s;toral, Virgil hath been thought guil|ty of too courtly a &s;tyle; his language is perfectly pure, and he often forgets he is among pea&s;ants. I have frequently wondered, that &s;ince he was &s;o con|ver&s;ant in the writings of Ennius, he had not imi|tated the ru&s;ticity of the Doric as well by the help
<PB N="323" REF="328">
of the old ob&s;olete Roman language, as Philips hath by the antiquated Engli&s;h: For example, might he not have &s;aid <HI>quoi</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>cui; quoi|jum</HI> for <HI>cujum; volt</HI> for <HI>vult,</HI> etc. as well as our modern hath <HI>welladay</HI> for <HI>alas, whileome</HI> for <HI>of old, make mock</HI> for <HI>deride,</HI> and <HI>witle&s;s younglings</HI> for <HI>&s;im|ple lambs,</HI> etc. by which means he had attained as much of the air of Theocritus, as Philips hath of Spencer?</P>
<P N="4">4. Mr. Pope hath fallen into the &s;ame error with Virgil. His clowns do not conver&s;e in all the &s;implicity proper to the country: His names are borrowed from Theocritus and Virgil, which are improper to the &s;cene of his pa&s;torals. He intro|duces Daphnis, Alexis, and Thyr&s;is on Briti&s;h plains, as Virgil had done before him on the Mantuan: Whereas Philips, who hath the &s;tricte&s;t regard to propriety, makes choice of names peculiar to the country, and more agreeable to a reader of deli|cacy; &s;uch as Hobbinol, Lobbin, Cuddy and Co|lin Clout.</P>
<P N="5">5. So ea&s;y as pa&s;toral writing may &s;eem (in the &s;implicity we have de&s;cribed it) yet it requires great reading, both of the ancients and moderns, to be a ma&s;ter of it. Philips hath given us mani|fe&s;t proofs of his knowledge of books. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed his competitor hath imitated <HI>&s;ome &s;in|gle thoughts</HI> of the ancients well enough (if we con|&s;ider he had not the happine&s;s of an Univer&s;ity education) but he hath di&s;per&s;ed them here and
<PB N="324" REF="329">
there, without that order and method which Mr. Philips ob&s;erves, who&s;e <HI>whole</HI> third pa&s;toral is an in&s;tance how well he hath &s;tudied the fifth of Vir|gil, and how judiciou&s;ly reduced Virgil's thoughts to the &s;tandard of Pa&s;toral; as his contention of Colin Clout and the Nightingale &s;hows with what exactne&s;s he hath imitated every line in Strada.</P>
<P N="6">6. When I remarked it as a principal fault, to introduce fruits and flowers of a foreign growth, in de&s;criptions where the &s;cene lies in our own country, I did not de&s;ign that ob&s;ervation &s;hould extend al&s;o to animals, or the &s;en&s;itive life; for Mr. Philips hath with great judgment de&s;cribed Wolves in England in his fir&s;t pa&s;toral. Nor would I have a poet &s;lavi&s;hly confine him&s;elf (as Mr. Pope hath done) to one particular Sea&s;on of the year, one certain Time of the day, and one unbroken Scene in each eclogue. 'Tis plain Spencer neglected this pedantry, who in his pa&s;to|ral of November mentions the mournful &s;ong of the Nightingale,
<Q><L>Sad Philomel her &s;ong in tears doth &s;teep.</L></Q>
And Mr. Philips, by a poetical creation, hath rai&s;ed up finer beds of flowers than the mo&s;t indu&s;|trious gardiner; his ro&s;es, endives, lilies, king|cups, and daffidils, blow all in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the better to di&s;cover the merits of our two contemporary Pa&s;toral writers, I &s;hall endea|vour to draw a parallel of them, by &s;etting &s;everal
<PB N="325" REF="330">
of their particular thoughts in the &s;ame light, where|by it will be obvious how much Philips hath the advantage. With what &s;implicity he introduces two &s;hepherds &s;inging alternately?</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Hobb.</HI> Come, Ro&s;alind, O come, for without thee</L>
<L>What plea&s;ure can the country have for me?</L>
<L>Come, Ro&s;alind, O come; my brinded kine,</L>
<L>My &s;nowy &s;heep, my farm and all, is thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Lanq.</HI> Come, Ro&s;alind, O come; here &s;hady bowers,</L>
<L>Here are cool fountains, and here &s;pringing flowers.</L>
<L>Come, Ro&s;alind; here ever let us &s;tay,</L>
<L>And &s;weetly wa&s;t our live-long time away.</L>
</LG>
<P>Our other pa&s;toral writer, in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame thought, deviates into downright Poetry:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Streph.</HI> In Spring the fields, in Autumn hills I love,</L>
<L>At morn the plains, at noon the &s;hady grove,</L>
<L>But Delia always; forc'd from Delia's &s;ight,</L>
<L>Nor plains at morn, nor groves at noon delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Daph.</HI> Sylvia's like Autumn ripe, yet mild as May,</L>
<L>More bright than noon, yet fre&s;h as early day;</L>
<L>Ev'n Spring di&s;plea&s;es, when &s;he &s;hines not here,</L>
<L>But ble&s;t with her, 'tis Spring throughout the year.</L>
</LG>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e authors, two &s;hepherds thus innocently de&s;cribe the behaviour of their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es:</P>
<SP>
<PB N="326" REF="331" MS="Y">
<SPEAKER>Hobb.</SPEAKER>
<L>As Marian bath'd, by chance I pa&s;&s;ed by,</L>
<L>She blu&s;h'd, and at me ca&s;t a &s;ide-long eye:</L>
<L>Then &s;wift beneath the cry&s;tal wave &s;he try'd</L>
<L>Her beauteous form, but all in vain, to hide.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lanq.</SPEAKER>
<L>As I cool me bath'd one &s;ultry day,</L>
<L>Fond Lydia lurking in the &s;edges lay.</L>
<L>The wanton laugh'd, and &s;eem'd in ha&s;te to fly;</L>
<L>Yet often &s;topp'd, and often turn'd her eye.</L>
</SP>
<P>The other modern (who it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed hath a knack of ver&s;ifying) hath it as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Streph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain,</L>
<L>Then, hid in &s;hades, eludes her eager &s;wain;</L>
<L>But feigns a Laugh, to &s;ee me &s;earch around,</L>
<L>And by that Laugh the willing fair is found.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daph.</SPEAKER>
<L>The &s;prightly Sylvia trips along the green,</L>
<L>She runs, but hopes &s;he does not run un&s;een;</L>
<L>While a kind glance at her pur&s;uer flies,</L>
<L>How much at variance are her feet and eyes!</L>
</SP>
<P>There is nothing the writers of this kind of poetry are fonder of than de&s;criptions of pa&s;toral Pre&s;ents. Philips &s;ays thus of a Sheep-hook,</P>
<LG>
<L>Of &s;ea&s;on'd elm; where &s;tuds of bra&s;s appear,</L>
<L>To &s;peak the giver's name, the month and year;</L>
<L>The hook of poli&s;h'd &s;teel, the handle turn'd,</L>
<L>And richly by the graver's &s;kill adorn'd.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="327" REF="332">
The other of a bowl embo&s;&s;ed with figures:</P>
<LG>
<L>where wanton ivy twines,</L>
<L>And &s;welling clu&s;ters bend the curling vines;</L>
<L>Four figures ri&s;ing from the work appear,</L>
<L>The various &s;ea&s;ons of the rolling year;</L>
<L>And, what is that which binds the radiant &s;ky,</L>
<L>Where twelve bright &s;igns in beauteous order lie?</L>
</LG>
<P>The &s;implicity of the &s;wain in this place, who for|gets the name of the Zodiack, is no ill imitation of Virgil: but how much more plainly and unaf|fectedly would Philips have dre&s;&s;ed this thought in his Doric?
<Q><L>And what that hight, which girds the welkin &s;heen,</L>
<L>Where twelve gay &s;igns in meet array are &s;een?</L></Q></P>
<P>If the reader would indulge his curio&s;ity any fur|ther in the compari&s;on of particulars, he may read the fir&s;t pa&s;toral of Philips with the &s;econd of his contemporary, and the fourth and &s;ixth of the former with the fourth and fir&s;t of the latter; where &s;everal parallel places will occur to every one.</P>
<P>Having now &s;hown &s;ome parts, in which the&s;e two writers may be compared, it is a ju&s;tice I owe to Mr. Philips to di&s;cover tho&s;e in which no man can compare with him. Fir&s;t, That beautiful ru&s;|ticity, of which I &s;hall only produce two in&s;tances out of a hundred not yet quoted:
<Q><PB N="328" REF="333">
<L>O woful day! O day of woe! quoth he,</L>
<L>And woful I, who live the day to &s;ee!</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;implicity of diction, the melancholy flowing of the numbers, the &s;olemnity of the &s;ound, and the ea&s;y turn of the words in this Dirge (to make u&s;e of our author's expre&s;&s;ion) are extremely ele|gant.</P>
<P>In another of his pa&s;torals, a &s;hepherd utters a Dirge not much inferior to the former, in the fol|lowing lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>Ah me the while! ah me! the luckle&s;s day,</L>
<L>Ah luckle&s;s lad! the rather might I &s;ay;</L>
<L>Ah &s;illy I! more &s;illy than my &s;heep,</L>
<L>Which on the flow'ry plains I once did keep.</L>
</LG>
<P>How he &s;till charms the ear with the&s;e artful re|petitions of the epithets; and how &s;ignificant is the la&s;t ver&s;e! I de&s;y the mo&s;t common reader to re|peat them, without feeling &s;ome motions of com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall rank his Proverbs, in which I formerly ob&s;erved he excells: For ex|ample:</P>
<LG>
<L>A rolling &s;tone is ever bare of mo&s;s;</L>
<L>And, to their co&s;t, green years old proverbs cro&s;s.</L>
<L>&mdash;He that late lies down, as late will ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;luggard-like, till noon-day &s;noaring lies.</L>
<L><PB N="329" REF="334">
&mdash;Again&s;t Ill-luck all cunning fore-&s;ight fails;</L>
<L>Whether we &s;leep or wake, it naught avails.</L>
<L>&mdash;Nor fear, from upright &s;entence, wrong.</L>
</LG>
<P>La&s;tly, his elegant Dialect, which alone might prove him the elde&s;t born of Spencer, and our on|ly true Arcadian. I &s;hould think it proper for the &s;everal writers of Pa&s;toral, to confine them&s;elves to their &s;everal Counties. Spencer &s;eems to have been of this opinion: for he hath laid the &s;cene of one of his Pa&s;torals in Wales; where with all the &s;implicity natural to that part of our i&s;land, one &s;hepherd bids the other good morrow, in an un|u&s;ual and elegant manner:
<Q><L>Diggon Davy, I bid hur God-day:</L>
<L>Or Diggon hur is, or I mi&s;-&s;ay.</L></Q></P>
<P>Diggon an&s;wers:
<Q><L>Hur was hur, while it was day-light;</L>
<L>But now hur is a mo&s;t wretched wight, etc.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t beautiful example of this kind that I ever met with, is in a very valuable piece which I chanced to find among &s;ome old manu&s;cripts, entituled, A Pa&s;toral Ballad: which I think, for its nature and &s;implicity, may (notwith&s;tanding the mode&s;ty of the title) be allowed a perfect Pa&s;|toral. It is compo&s;ed in the Somer&s;et&s;hire dia|lect, and the names &s;uch as are proper to the country people. It may be ob&s;erved as a further beauty of this Pa&s;toral, the words Nymph, Dryad,
<PB N="330" REF="335">
Naiad, Fawn, Cupid, or Satyr, are not once men|tioned throughout the whole. I &s;hall make no apology for in&s;erting &s;ome few lines of this excel|lent piece. Cicily breaks thus into the &s;ubject, as &s;he is going a milking:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cicily.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rager, go vetch tha <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">That is, the Kine or Cows.</NOTE>Kee, or el&s;e tha Zun</L>

<L>Thou &s;hould&s;t not ax ma tweece, but I've a bee</L>
<L>To dreve our bull to bull tha Par&s;on's Kee.</L>
</SP>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that this whole dialogue is formed upon the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Jealou&s;y;</HI> and his men|tioning the Par&s;on's Kine naturally revives the jea|lou&s;y of the &s;hepherde&s;s Cicily, which &s;he expre&s;&s;es as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cicily.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah Rager, Rager, ches was zore avraid,</L>
<L>When in you Vield you ki&s;s'd the Par&s;on's maid:</L>

<L>Tha Par&s;on's maid is &s;till a maid for me.</L>
</SP>
<P>In which an&s;wer of his, are expre&s;&s;ed at once that Spirit of Religion, and that Innocence of the
<PB N="331" REF="336">
Golden age, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by all wri|ters of Pa&s;toral.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this piece, the author re|conciles the Lovers, and ends the Eclogue the mo&s;t &s;imply in the world:
<Q><L>So Rager parted vor to vetch tha Kee,</L>

<P>I am loth to &s;how my fondne&s;s for antiquity &s;o far as to prefer this ancient Briti&s;h author to our pre|&s;ent Engli&s;h Writers of Pa&s;toral; but I cannot avoid making this obvious remark, that Philips hath hit into the &s;ame road with this old We&s;t Country Bard of ours.</P>
<P>After all that hath been &s;aid, I hope none can think it any inju&s;tice to Mr. Pope that I forebore to mention him as a Pa&s;toral writer; &s;ince, upon the whole, he is of the &s;ame cla&s;s with Mo&s;chus and Bion, whom we have excluded that rank; and of who&s;e Eclogues, as well as &s;ome of Virgil's, it may be &s;aid, that (according to the de&s;cription we have given of this &s;ort of poetry) they are by no means Pa&s;torals, but &s;omething better.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Cannot think it extravagant to imagine, that mankind are no le&s;s, in proportion, account|able for the ill u&s;e of their dominion over creatures of the lower rank of beings, than for the exerci&s;e of tyranny over their own Species. The more entirely the inferior creation is &s;ubmitted to our power, the more an&s;werable we &s;hould &s;eem for our mi&s;management of it; and the rather, as the very condition of nature renders the&s;e creatures in|capable of receiving any recompence in another life for their ill treatment in this.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable of tho&s;e noxious animals, which have qualities mo&s;t powerful to injure us, that they naturally avoid mankind, and never hurt us unle&s;s provoked, or nece&s;&s;itated by hunger. Man, on the other hand, &s;eeks out and pur&s;ues even the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive animals, on purpo&s;e to per&s;ecute and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Montaigne thinks it &s;ome reflection upon hu|man nature it&s;elf, that few people take delight in &s;eeing bea&s;ts care&s;s or play together, but almo&s;t every one is plea&s;ed to &s;ee them lacerate and wor|ry one another. I am &s;orry this temper is become
<PB N="333" REF="338">
almo&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hing character of our own na|tion, from the ob&s;ervation which is made by fo|reigners of our beloved pa&s;times, Bear-baiting, Cock-fighting, and the like. We &s;hould find it hard to vindicate the de&s;troying of any thing that has life, merely out of wantonne&s;s; yet in this principle our children are bred up, and one of the fir&s;t plea&s;ures we allow them, is the licence of in|flicting pain upon poor animals: almo&s;t as &s;oon as we are &s;en&s;ible what life is our&s;elves, we make it our &s;port to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good u&s;e might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and in&s;ects. Mr. Locke takes notice of a mother who permit|ted them to her children, but rewarded or puni&s;h|ed them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them betimes into a dai|ly exerci&s;e of humanity, and improving their very diver&s;ion to a virtue.</P>
<P>I fancy too, &s;ome advantage might be taken of the common notion, that 'tis ominous or unlucky, to de&s;troy &s;ome &s;orts of birds, as Swallows and Martins. This opinion might po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the confidence the&s;e birds &s;eem to put in us by building under our roofs, &s;o that it is a kind of violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality to murder them. As for Robin-red-brea&s;ts in particular, 'tis not im|probable they owe their &s;ecurity to the old ballad of <HI>The Children in the Wood.</HI> However it be, I don't know, I &s;ay, why this prejudice, well im|proved
<PB N="334" REF="339">
and carried as far as it would go, might not be made to conduce to the pre&s;ervation of many in|nocent creatures, which are now expo&s;ed to all the wantonne&s;s of an ignorant barbarity.</P>
<P>There are other animals that have the misfor|tune, for no manner of rea&s;on, to be treated as common enemies where-ever found. The conceit that a Cat has nine lives has co&s;t at lea&s;t nine lives in ten of the whole race of them: &s;carce a boy in the &s;treets but has in this point outdone Hercules him&s;elf, who was famous for killing a mon&s;ter that had but three lives. Whether the unaccount|able animo&s;ity again&s;t this u&s;eful dome&s;tick may be any cau&s;e of the general per&s;ecution of Owls (who are a &s;ort of feathered cats) or whether it be only an unrea&s;onable pique the moderns have taken to a &s;erious countenance, I &s;hall not determine. Tho' I am inclined to believe the former; &s;ince I ob|&s;erve the &s;ole rea&s;on alledged for the de&s;truction of Frogs is becau&s;e they are like Toads. Yet amid&s;t all the misfortunes of the&s;e unfriended creatures, 'tis &s;ome happine&s;s that we have not yet taken a fancy to eat them: for &s;hould our countrymen re|fine upon the French never &s;o little, 'tis not to be conceived to what unheard-of torments owls, cats, and frogs may be yet re&s;erved.</P>
<P>When we grow up to men, we have another &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Sanguinary &s;ports; in particular hunt|ing. I dare not attack a diver&s;ion which has &s;uch authority and cu&s;tom to &s;upport it; but mu&s;t have
<PB N="335" REF="340">
leave to be of opinion, that the agitation of that exerci&s;e, with the example and number of the cha|&s;ers, not a little contribute to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e checks, which compa&s;&s;ion would naturally &s;ugge&s;t in be|half of the animal pur&s;ued. Nor &s;hall I &s;ay with Mon&s;ieur Fleury, that this &s;port is a remain of the Gothic barbarity; but I mu&s;t animadvert upon a certain cu&s;tom yet in u&s;e with us, and barbarous enough to be derived from the Goths, or even the Scythians: I mean that &s;avage compliment our hunt&s;men pa&s;s upon Ladies of quality, who are pre&s;ent at the death of a Stag, when they put the knife in their hands to cut the throat of a helple&s;s, trembling and weeping creature.
<Q><L>Que&s;tuque cruentus,</L>
<L>Atque Imploranti &s;imilis.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But if our &s;ports are de&s;tructive, our gluttony is more &s;o, and in a more inhuman manner. Lob|&s;ters roa&s;ted alive, Pigs whipp'd to death, Fowls &s;ewed up, are te&s;timonies of our outragious lux|ury. Tho&s;e, who (as Seneca expre&s;&s;es it) divide their lives betwixt an anxious con&s;cience, and a nau|&s;eated &s;tomach, have a ju&s;t reward of their glut|tony in the di&s;ea&s;es it brings with it: for human &s;avages, like other wild bea&s;ts, find &s;nares and poy|&s;on in the provi&s;ions of life, and are allured by their appetite to their de&s;truction. I know nothing more &s;hocking, or horrid, than the pro&s;pect of one of their kitchins covered with blood, and fill|ed
<PB N="336" REF="341">
with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures&punc; It gives one an image of a Giant's den in a ro|mance be&s;traw'd with the &s;cattered heads and man|gled limbs of tho&s;e who were &s;lain by his cruelty.</P>
<P>The excellent Plutarch (who has more &s;trokes of good-nature in his writings than I remember in any author) cites a &s;aying of Cato to this effect: <Q>&startq;That 'tis no ea&s;y ta&s;k to preach to the belly which has no ears. Yet if (&s;ays he) we are a&s;hamed to be &s;o out of fa&s;hion as not to offend, let us at lea&s;t offend with &s;ome di&s;cretion and mea&s;ure. If we kill an animal for our provi&s;ion, let us do it with the meltings of compa&s;&s;ion, and without tor|menting it. Let us con&s;ider, that 'tis in its own nature cruelty to put a living creature to death; we at lea&s;t de&s;troy a &s;oul that has &s;en&s;e and per|ception.&endq;</Q> In the life of Cato the Cen&s;or, he takes occa&s;ion from the &s;evere di&s;po&s;ition of that man to di&s;cour&s;e in this manner: <Q>&startq;It ought to be e&s;teemed a happine&s;s to mankind, that our hu|manity has a wider &s;phere to exert it&s;elf in, than bare ju&s;tice. It is no more than the obligation of our very birth to practi&s;e equity to our own kind; but humanity may be extended thro' the whole order of creatures, even to the meane&s;t: &s;uch actions of charity are the over-flowings of a mild good nature on all below us. It is cer|tainly the part of a well-natured man to take care of his hor&s;es and dogs, not only in expec|tation
<PB N="337" REF="342">
of their labour while they are foals and whelps, but even when their old age has made them incapable of &s;ervice.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us of a wi&s;e and polite nation, that rejected a per&s;on of the fir&s;t quality, who &s;tood for a judiciary office, only becau&s;e he had been ob&s;erved in his youth to take plea&s;ure in tearing and murdering of birds. And of another, that ex|pelled a man out of the &s;enate for da&s;hing a bird again&s;t the ground which had taken &s;helter in his bo&s;om. Every one knows how remarkable the Turks are for their humanity in this kind. I re|member an Arabian author, who has written a treati&s;e to &s;hew, how far a man, &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a de&s;ert i&s;land, without any in&s;truc|tion, or &s;o much as the &s;ight of any other man, may, by the pure light of nature, attain the know|ledge of philo&s;ophy and virtue. One of the fir&s;t things he makes him ob&s;erve is, that univer&s;al be|nevolence of nature in the protection and pre&s;er|vation of its creatures. In imitation of which, the fir&s;t act of virtue he thinks his &s;elf-taught philo&s;o|pher would of cour&s;e fall into is, to relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t all the animals about him in their wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Ovid has &s;ome very tender and pathetick lines applicable to this occa&s;ion:</P>
<LG>
<L>Quid merui&s;tis, oves, placidum pecus, inque tegendos</L>
<L>Natum homines, pleno quae fertis in ubere nectar?</L>

<L>Quid meruere boves, animal &s;ine fraude doli&s;que,</L>

<L>Aut qui vagitus fimiles puerilibus hoedum</L>
<L>Edentem jugulare pote&s;t!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>Perhaps that voice or cry &s;o nearly re&s;embling the human, with which providence has endued &s;o many different animals, might purpo&s;ely be given them to move our pity, and prevent tho&s;e cruel|ties we are too apt to inflict on our fellow crea|tures.</P>
<P>There is a pa&s;&s;age in the book of Jonas, when God declares his unwillingne&s;s to de&s;troy Nineveh, where, methinks, that compa&s;&s;ion of the creator, which extends to the meane&s;t rank of his crea|tures, <Q>is expre&s;&s;ed with wonderful tenderne&s;s&mdash;&startq;Should I not &s;pare Nineveh the great city, wherein are more than &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons&mdash;And al&s;o much cattel?&endq;</Q> And we have in Deu|teronomy a precept of great good nature of this &s;ort with a ble&s;&s;ing in form annexed to it in tho&s;e words: <Q>&startq;&endq;If thou &s;halt find a bird's ne&s;t in the
<PB N="339" REF="344">
way, thou &s;halt not take the dam with the young: But thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e let the dam go, that it may be well with thee, and that thou may'&s;t prolong thy days.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, there is certainly a degree of gra|titude owing to tho&s;e animals that &s;erve us; as for &s;uch as are mortal or noxious, we have a right to de&s;troy them; and for tho&s;e that are neither of advantage or prejudice to us, the common enjoy|ment of life is what I cannot think we ought to deprive them of.</P>
<P>This whole-matter, with regard to each of the&s;e con&s;iderations, is &s;et in a very agreeable light in one of the Per&s;ian fables of Pilpay, with which I &s;hall end this paper.</P>
<P>A traveller pa&s;&s;ing thro' a thicket, and &s;eeing a few &s;parks of a fire, which &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers had kindled as they went that way before, made up to it. On a &s;udden the &s;parks caught hold of a bu&s;h, in the mid&s;t of which lay an adde$, and &s;et it in flames. The adder intreated the traveller's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, who tying a bag to the end of his &s;taff, reached it, and drew him out: he then bid him go where he plea&s;ed, but never more be hurt|ful to men, &s;ince he owed his life to a man's compa&s;&s;ion. The adder, however, prepared to &s;ting him, and when he expo&s;tulated how unju&s;t it was to retaliate good with evil, I &s;hall do no more (&s;aid the adder) than what you men practice every day, who&s;e cu&s;tom it is to requite
<PB N="340" REF="345">
benefits with ingratitude. If you can deny this truth, let us refer it to the fir&s;t we meet. The man con&s;ented, and &s;eeing a Tree, put the que&s;|tion to it, in what manner a good turn was to be recompenced? If you mean according to the u&s;age of Men (reply'd the Tree) By its contrary. I have been &s;tanding here the&s;e hundred years to protect them from the &s;corching &s;un, and in requital they have cut down my branches, and are going to &s;aw my body into planks. Upon this the adder in&s;ult|ing the man, he appealed to a &s;econd evidence, which was granted, and immediately they met a Cow. The &s;ame demand was made, and much the &s;ame an&s;wer given, that among men it was cer|tainly &s;o: I know it, &s;aid the Cow, by woful ex|perience; for I have &s;erved a man this long time with milk, butter and chee&s;e, and brought him be&s;ides a Calf every year: but now I am old, he turns me into this pa&s;ture, with de&s;ign to &s;ell me to a butcher, who will &s;hortly make an end of me. The traveller upon this &s;tood con|founded, but de&s;ired of courte&s;y one trial more, to be finally judged by the next bea&s;ts they &s;hould meet. This happened to be the Fox, who upon hearing the &s;tory in all its circum&s;tances, could not be per&s;uaded it was po&s;&s;ible for the adder to get into &s;o narrow a bag. The adder to convince him went in again; the Fox told the man he had now his enemy in his power, and with that he fa&s;ten|ed the bag, and cru&s;hed him to pieces.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I Remember a &s;aying of yours concerning per|&s;ons in low circum&s;tances of &s;tature, that their littlene&s;s would hardly be taken notice of, if they did not manife&s;t a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of it them&s;elves in all their behaviour. Indeed the ob&s;ervation that no man is ridiculous for being what he is, but only for the affectation of being &s;omething more, is equally true in regard to the mind and the body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I que&s;tion not but it will be plea&s;ing to you to hear, that a &s;ett of us have formed a &s;ociety, who are &s;worn to dare to be &s;hort, and boldly bear out the dignity of littlene&s;s under the no&s;es of tho&s;e enormous engro&s;&s;ers of manhood, tho&s;e hyperbolical mon&s;ters of the Species, the tall fellows that overlook us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The day of our in&s;titution was the tenth of December, being the &s;horte&s;t of the year, on which we are to hold an annual Fea&s;t over a di&s;h of Shrimps.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="347">
<Q>&startq;&endq;The place we have cho&s;en for this meeting is in the little Piazza, not without an eye to the neighbourhood of Mr. Powel's Opera, for the performers of which, we have, as becomes us, a brotherly affection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;At our fir&s;t re&s;ort hither, an old woman brought her &s;on to the Club Room, de&s;iring he might be educated in this School, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw here were finer Boys than ordinary. How|ever, this accident no way di&s;couraged our de|&s;igns. We began with &s;ending invitations to tho&s;e of a &s;tature not exceeding five foot, to re|pair to our a&s;&s;embly; but the greater part re|turned excu&s;es, or pretended they were not qua|lified.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;One &s;aid, he was indeed but five foot at pre|&s;ent, but repre&s;ented that he &s;hould &s;oon ex|ceed that proportion, his perriwig-maker and &s;hoe-maker having lately promi&s;ed him three inches more betwixt them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Another alledged, he was &s;o unfortunate as to have one leg &s;horter than the other, and who|ever had determined his &s;tature to five foot, had taken him at a di&s;advantage; for when he was mounted on the other leg, he was at lea&s;t five foot two inches and a half.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There were &s;ome who que&s;tioned the exactne&s;s of our mea&s;ures, and others in&s;tead of complying, returned us informations of people yet &s;horter than them&s;elves. In a word, almo&s;t every one
<PB N="343" REF="348">
recommended &s;ome neighbour or acquaintance, whom he was willing we &s;hould look upon to be le&s;s than he. We were not a little a&s;hamed, that tho&s;e who are pa&s;t the years of growth, and who&s;e beards pronounce them men, &s;hould be guilty of as many unfair tricks, in this point, as the mo&s;t a&s;piring children when they are mea&s;ured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;We therefore proceeded to fit up the Club-Room, and provide conveniencies for our ac|commodation. In the fir&s;t place we cau&s;ed a total removal of all the chairs, &s;tools, and tables, which had &s;erved the gro&s;s of mankind for many years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The di&s;advantages we had undergone while we made u&s;e of the&s;e, were un&s;peakable. The Pre&s;ident's whole body was &s;unk in the elbow-chair, and when his arms were &s;pread over it, he appeared (to the great le&s;&s;ening of his dig|nity) like a child in a go-cart: It was al&s;o &s;o wide in the &s;eat, as to give a wag occa&s;ion of &s;aying, that, notwith&s;tanding the Pre&s;ident &s;ate in it,</Q> there was a <HI>Sede Vacante.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The table was &s;o high, that one who came by chance to the door, &s;eeing our chins ju&s;t above the pewter di&s;hes, took us for a circle of men that &s;ate ready to be &s;haved, and &s;ent in half a dozen Barbers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Another time, one of the Club &s;poke in a lu|di$rous manner of the Pre&s;ident, imagining he
<PB N="344" REF="349">
had been ab&s;ent, when he was only eclip&s;ed by a fla&s;k of Florence, which &s;tood on the table in a parallel line before his face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;We therefore new furni&s;hed the room in all re&s;pects proportionably to us; and had the door made lower, &s;o as to admit no man of above five foot high without bru&s;hing his foretop, which whoever does is utterly unqualified to &s;it among us.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Some of the Statutes of the Club are as follow.</L></Q>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I. If it be proved upon any member, though never &s;o duly qualified, that he &s;trives as much as po&s;&s;ible to get above his &s;ize, by &s;tretching, cocking, or the like; or that he hath &s;tood on tiptoe in a crowd, with de&s;ign to be taken for as tall a man as the re&s;t; or hath privily conveyed any large book, cricket, or other device under him to exalt him on his &s;eat: every &s;uch offender &s;hall be &s;entenced to walk in pumps for a whole month.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;II. If any member &s;hall take advantage from the fulne&s;s or length of his wig, or any part of his dre&s;s, or the immoderate extent of his hat, or otherwi&s;e, to &s;eem larger or higher than he is, it is ordered, he &s;hall wear red heels to his &s;hoes, and a red feather in his hat; which may appa|rently mark and &s;et bounds to the extremities of his &s;mall dimen&s;ion, that all people may readily find him out between his hat and his &s;hoes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="350">
<Q>&startq;&endq;III. If any member &s;hall purcha&s;e a hor&s;e for his own riding, above fourteen hands and a half in height; that hor&s;e &s;hall forthwith be &s;old, a Scotch galloway bought in its &s;tead for him, and the overplus of the money &s;hall treat the Club.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;&endq;IV. If any member, in direct contradiction to the fundamental laws of the Society, &s;hall wear the heels of his &s;hoes exceeding one inch and half; it &s;hall be interpreted as an open re|nunciation of littlene&s;s, and the criminal &s;hall in&s;tantly be expelled. Note, The form to be u&s;ed in expelling a member &s;hall be in the&s;e words; Go from among us, and be tall if you can!</Q>
<Q>&startq;&endq;It is the unanimous opinion of our whole &s;o|ciety, that &s;ince the race of mankind is granted to have decrea&s;ed in &s;tature, from the beginning to this pre&s;ent, it is the intent of Nature it&s;elf, that men &s;hould be little; and we believe, that all human kind &s;hall at la&s;t grow down to per|fection, that is to &s;ay, be reduced to <HI>our own mea&s;ure.</HI></Q>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;YOU are now acquainted with the nature and de&s;ign of our in&s;titution; the Cha|racter of the members, and the topicks of our Conver&s;ation, are what remain for the &s;ubject of this Epi&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons of our a&s;&s;embly are a little Poet, a little Lover, a little Politician, and a little Heroe. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, Dick Di&s;tick by name, we have elected Pre&s;ident: not only as he is the &s;horte&s;t of us all, but be|cau&s;e he has entertained &s;o ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of his &s;tature, as to go generally in black, that he may appear yet le&s;s. Nay, to that perfection is he arrived, that he &s;toops as he walks. The figure of the man is odd enough; he is a lively little creature, with long arms and legs: a Spi|der is no ill emblem of him: he has been taken at a di&s;tance for a &s;mall Windmill. But indeed what principally moved us in his favour was his talent in Poetry, for he hath promi&s;ed to under|take a long work in &s;hort ver&s;e to celebrate the
<PB N="347" REF="352">
heroes of our &s;ize. He has entertained &s;o great a re&s;pect for Statius, on the &s;core of that line,
<Q><L>Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus,</L></Q>
that he once de&s;igned to tran&s;late the whole Thebaid for the &s;ake of little Tydeus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Tom Tiptoe, a dapper black fellow, is the mo&s;t gallant lover of the age. He is parti|cularly nice in his habiliments; and to the end ju&s;tice may be done him that way, con&s;tantly employs the &s;ame arti&s;t who makes attire for the neighb'ring Princes and Ladies of quality at Mr. Powel's. The vivacity of his temper inclines him &s;ometimes to boa&s;t of the favours of the Fair. He was t'other night excu&s;ing his ab&s;ence from the club on account of an a&s;&s;ignation with a Lady (and, as he had the vanity to tell us, a tall one too) who had con&s;ented to the full ac|compli&s;hment of his de&s;ires that evening: But one of the company, who was his confident, a&s;&s;ured us &s;he was a woman of humour, and made the agreement on this condition, that his toe &s;hould be tied to hers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Our Politician is a per&s;on of real gravity, and profe&s;&s;ed wi&s;dom: Gravity in a man of this &s;ize, compared with that of one of ordinary bulk, appears like the gravity of a Cat compared with that of a Lion. This gentleman is accu&s;tom|ed to talk to him&s;elf, and was once over-heard to compare his own per&s;on to a little cabinet,
<PB N="348" REF="353">
wherein are locked up all the &s;ecrets of &s;tate, and refined &s;chemes of Princes. His face is pale and meagre, which proceeds from much watch|ing and &s;tudying for the welfare of Europe, which is al&s;o thought to have &s;tinted his growth: for he hath de&s;troyed his own con&s;titution with tak|ing care of that of the nation. He is what Mon&s;. Balzac calls, a great Di&s;tiller of the max|ims of Tacitus: when he &s;peaks, it is &s;lowly, and word by word, as one that is loth to enrich you too fa&s;t with his ob&s;ervations; like a lim|beck that gives you, drop by drop, an extract of the little that is in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The la&s;t I &s;hall mention is Tim. Tuck, the Hero. He is particularly remarkable for the length of his Sword, which inter&s;ects his per|&s;on in a cro&s;s line, and makes him appear not unlike a Fly that the boys have run a pin thro', and &s;et a walking. He once challenged a tall fellow for giving him a blow on the pate with his elbow, as he pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treet. But what he e&s;pecially values him&s;elf upon is, that in all the campaigns he has made, he never once duck'd at the whizz of a cannon ball. Tim. was full as large at fourteen years old as he is now. This we are tender of mentioning, your little Heroes being generally cholerick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The&s;e are the gentlemen that mo&s;t enliven our conver&s;ation. The di&s;cour&s;e generally turns upon &s;uch accidents, whether fortunate or un|fortunate,
<PB N="349" REF="354">
as are daily occa&s;ioned by our &s;ize: the&s;e we faithfully communicate, either as mat|ter of mirth or of con&s;olation to each other. The Pre&s;ident had lately an unlucky fall, being unable to keep his legs on a &s;tormy day; where|upon he informed us it was no new di&s;a&s;ter, but the &s;ame a certain ancient Poet had been &s;ubject to; who is recorded to have been &s;o light that he was obliged to poize him&s;elf again&s;t the wind, with lead on one &s;ide, and his own works on the other. The Lover confe&s;t the other night that he had been cured of love to a tall woman, by reading over the legend of Ragotine in Scar|ron, with his tea, three mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Our Hero rarely acquaints us with any of his un&s;ucce&s;sful adventures: and as for the Politici|an, he declares him&s;elf an utter enemy to all kind of burle&s;que, &s;o will never di&s;compo&s;e the au&s;terity of his a&s;pect by laughing at our adven|tures, much le&s;s di&s;cover any of his own in this ludicrous light. Whatever he tells of any ac|cidents that befal him, is by way of complaint, nor is he ever laugh'd at but in his <HI>Ab&s;ence.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;We are likewi&s;e particularly careful to com|municate in the club all &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of hi&s;tory, or characters of illu&s;trious per&s;onages, as any way reflect honour on little men. Tim. Tuck having but ju&s;t reading enough for a military man, perpetually entertains us with the &s;ame &s;tories, of little David that conquered the mighty
<PB N="350" REF="355">
Goliah, and little Luxembourg that made Louis xiv. a grand Monarque, never forgetting lit|tle Alexander the great. Dick Di&s;tick celebrates the exceeding humanity of Augu&s;tus, who call|ed Horace <HI>lepidi&s;&s;imum homunciolum;</HI> and is won|derfully plea&s;ed with Voiture and Scarron, for having &s;o well de&s;cribed their diminutive forms to po&s;terity. He is peremptorily of opinion, again&s;t a great Reader and all his adherents, that Ae&s;op was not a jot properer or hand&s;omer than he is repre&s;ented by the common pictures. But the Soldier believes with the learned per&s;on above-mentioned; for he thinks none but an impudent tall author could be guilty of &s;uch an unmannerly piece of &s;atire on little warriors, as his Battle of the Mou&s;e and the Frog. The Politician is very proud of a certain King of Egypt, called Bocchor, who, as Diodorus a&s;|&s;ures us, was a per&s;on of a very low &s;tature, but far exceeded all that went before him in di&s;cre|tion and politicks.</Q></P>

<P>I Lately took a particular friend of mine to my hou&s;e in the country, not without &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ion, that it could afford little entertainment to a man of his polite ta&s;te, particularly in archi|tecture and gardening, who had &s;o long been con|ver&s;ant with all that is beautiful and great in ei|ther.
<PB N="352" REF="357">
But it was a plea&s;ant &s;urprize to me, to hear him often declare he had found in my little retire|ment that beauty which he always thought want|ing in the mo&s;t celebrated &s;eats (or, if you will, Villa's) of the nation. This he de&s;cribed to me in tho&s;e ver&s;es with which Martial begins one of his epigrams:</P>
<LG>
<L>Baiana no&s;tri villa, Ba&s;&s;e, Fau&s;tini,</L>
<L>Non otio&s;is ordinata myrtetis,</L>
<L>Viduaque platano, ton&s;ilique buxeto,</L>
<L>Ingrata lati &s;patia detinet campi;</L>
<L>Sed rure vero, barbaroque laetatur.</L>
</LG>
<P>There is certainly &s;omething in the amiable &s;implicity of unadorned Nature, that &s;preads over the mind a more noble &s;ort of tranquillity, and a loftier &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, than can be rai&s;ed from the nicer &s;cenes of art.</P>
<P>This was the ta&s;te of the Ancients in their gar|dens, as we may di&s;cover from the de&s;criptions extant of them. The two mo&s;t celebrated wits of the world have each of them left us a particular picture of a Garden; wherein tho&s;e great ma&s;ters being wholly unconfined, and painting at plea&s;ure, may be thought to have given a full idea of what they e&s;teemed mo&s;t excellent in this way. The&s;e (one may ob&s;erve) con&s;i&s;t intirely of the u&s;eful part of horticulture, fruit trees, herbs, water, etc. The pieces I am &s;peaking of are Virgil's account of the garden of the old Corycian, and Homer's of that
<PB N="353" REF="358">
of Alcinous in the &s;eventh Ody&s;&s;ey, to which I re|fer the reader.</P>
<P>Sir William Temple has remarked, that this garden of Homer contains all the ju&s;te&s;t rules and provi&s;ions which can go toward compo&s;ing the be&s;t gardens. Its extent was four Acres, which, in tho&s;e times of &s;implicity, was looked upon as a large one, even for a Prince. It was inclo&s;ed all round for defence; and for conveniency joined clo&s;e to the gates of the Palace.</P>
<P>He mentions next the Trees, which were &s;tand|ards, and &s;uffered to grow to their full height. The fine de&s;cription of the Fruits that never failed, and the eternal Zephyrs, is only a more noble and poetical way of expre&s;&s;ing the continual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of one fruit after another throughout the year.</P>
<P>The Vineyard &s;eems to have been a plantation di&s;tinct from the Garden; as al&s;o the beds of Greens mentioned afterwards at the extremity of the inclo&s;ure, in the u&s;ual place of our Kitchen Gardens.</P>
<P>The two Fountains are di&s;po&s;ed very remark|ably. They ro&s;e within the inclo&s;ure, and were brought in by conduits or ducts; one of them to water all parts of the gardens, and the other un|derneath the Palace into the Town, for the &s;er|vice of the publick.</P>
<P>How contrary to this &s;implicity is the modern practice of gardening? We &s;eem to make it our

&s;tudy to recede from Nature, not only in the va|rious ton&s;ure of greens into the mo&s;t regular and formal &s;hapes, but even in mon&s;trous attempts be|yond the reach of the art it&s;elf: we run into &s;cul|pture, and are yet better plea&s;ed to have our Trees in the mo&s;t aukward figures of men and animals, than in the mo&s;t regular of their own.</P>

<P>I believe it is no wrong ob&s;ervation, that per|&s;ons of genius, and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t capable of art, are always mo&s;t fond of nature; as &s;uch are chiefly &s;en&s;ible, that all art con&s;i&s;ts in the imitation and &s;tudy of nature: On the contrary, people of the common level of under&s;tanding are principally delighted with the little niceties and fanta&s;tical operations of art, and con&s;tantly think that fine&s;t which is lea&s;t natural.

<HEAD>PREFACE TO HOMER'S ILIAD.</HEAD>
<P>HOMER is univer&s;ally allowed to have had the greate&s;t <HI>Invention</HI> of any writer what|ever. The prai&s;e of Judgment Virgil has ju&s;tly conte&s;ted with him, and others may have their preten&s;ions as to particular excellencies; but his Invention remains yet unrival'd. Nor is it a won|der if he has ever been acknowledged the greate&s;t of poets, who mo&s;t excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that in different degrees di&s;tingui&s;hes all great Genius's: The utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human &s;tudy, learning, and indu&s;try, which ma&s;ter every thing be&s;ides, can never attain to this. It furni&s;hes Art with all her materials, and without it, Judgment it&s;elf can at be&s;t but <HI>&s;teal wi&s;ely:</HI> For Art is only like a pru|dent &s;teward that lives on managing the riches of Nature. Whatever prai&s;es may be given to works of Judgment, there is not even a &s;ingle beauty in them, to which the Invention mu&s;t not contri|bute. As in the mo&s;t regular gardens, Art can
<PB N="358" REF="363">
only reduce the beauties of Nature to more regu|larity, and &s;uch a figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is therefore more enter|tained with. And perhaps the rea&s;on why com|mon Criticks are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, becau&s;e they find it ea&s;ier for them&s;elves to pur&s;ue their ob&s;ervations through an uniform and bound|ed walk of Art, than to comprehend the va&s;t and various extent of Nature.</P>
<P>Our author's work is a wild paradi&s;e, where if we cannot &s;ee all the beauties &s;o di&s;tinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only becau&s;e the number of them is infinitely greater. 'Tis like a copious nur|&s;ery which contains the &s;eeds and fir&s;t productions of every kind, out of which tho&s;e who followed him have but &s;elected &s;ome particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If &s;ome things are too luxuriant, it is owing to the richne&s;s of the &s;oil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only becau&s;e they are over-run and oppre&s;t by tho&s;e of a &s;tronger na|ture.</P>
<P>It is to the &s;trength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequal'd fire and rapture, which is &s;o forcible in Homer, that no man of a true poetical &s;pirit is ma&s;ter of him&s;elf while he reads him. What he writes, is of the mo&s;t ani|mated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a coun|cil
<PB N="359" REF="364">
be called, or a battle fought, you are not cold|ly informed of what was &s;aid or done as from a third per&s;on; the reader is hurried out of him&s;elf by the force of the Poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a &s;pectator. The cour&s;e of his ver&s;es re&s;embles that of the army he de&s;cribes,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L></Q>
<HI>They pour along like a fire that &s;weeps the whole earth before it.</HI> 'Tis however remarkable that his fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not di&s;covered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fulle&s;t &s;plendor: It grows in the progre&s;s both up|on him&s;elf and others, and becomes on fire like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact di&s;|po&s;ition, ju&s;t thought, correct elocution, poli&s;hed numbers, may have been found in a thou&s;and; but this poetical fire, this <HI>Vivida vis animi,</HI> in a very few. Even in works where all tho&s;e are imperfect or neglected, this can over-power critici&s;m, and make us admire even while we di&s;approve. Nay, where this appears, though attended with ab&s;urdi|ties, it brightens all the rubbi&s;h about it, till we &s;ee nothing but its own &s;plendor. This <HI>Fire</HI> is di&s;cerned in Virgil, but di&s;cerned as through a gla&s;s, reflected from Homer, more &s;hining than fierce, but every where equal and con&s;tant: In Lucan and Statius, it bur&s;ts out in &s;udden, &s;hort, and interrupted fla&s;hes: In Milton it glows like a
<PB N="360" REF="365">
furnace kept up to an uncommon ardor by the force of art: In Shake&s;pear, it &s;trikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: But in Homer, and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irre&s;i&s;tibly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here endeavour to &s;how, how this va&s;t <HI>Invention</HI> exerts it&s;elf in a manner &s;uperior to that of any poet, through all the main con&s;tituent parts of his work, as it is the great and peculiar charac|teri&s;tic which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from all other au|thors.</P>
<P>This &s;trong and ruling faculty was like a pow|erful &s;tar, which in the violence of its cour&s;e, drew all things within its <HI>vortex.</HI> It &s;eemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compa&s;s of nature to &s;upply his maxims and reflections; all the inward pa&s;&s;ions and affections of mankind, to furni&s;h his charac|ters; and all the outward forms and images of things for his de&s;criptions; but wanting yet an ampler &s;phere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundle&s;s walk for his imagination, and crea|ted a world for him&s;elf in the invention of <HI>Fable.</HI> That which Ari&s;totle calls the <HI>Soul of poetry,</HI> was fir&s;t breathed into it by Homer. I &s;hall begin with con&s;idering him in this part, as it is naturally the fir&s;t, and I &s;peak of it both as it means the de|&s;ign of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</P>
<P>Fable may be divided into the <HI>probable,</HI> the <HI>al|legorical,</HI> and the <HI>marvellous.</HI> The <HI>probable fable</HI>
<PB N="361" REF="366">
is the recital of &s;uch actions as though they did not happen, yet might, in the common cour&s;e of na|ture: Or of &s;uch as though they did, become fa|bles by the additional epi&s;odes and manner of tell|ing them. Of this &s;ort is the main &s;tory of an Epic poem, <HI>the return of</HI> Uly&s;&s;es, <HI>the &s;ettlement of the</HI> Trojans <HI>in</HI> Italy, or the like. That of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the <HI>anger of</HI> Achilles, the mo&s;t &s;hort and &s;ingle &s;ubject that ever was cho&s;en by any Poet. Yet this he has &s;upplied with a va&s;ter variety of incidents and events, and crouded with a greater number of councils, &s;peeches, battles, and epi&s;odes of all kinds, than are to be found even in tho&s;e poems who&s;e &s;chemes are of the utmo&s;t latitude and irre|gularity. The action is hurried on with the mo&s;t vehement &s;pirit, and its whole duration employs not &s;o much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of &s;o warm a genius, aided him&s;elf by taking in a more exten&s;ive &s;ubject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the de&s;ign of both Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic Poets have u&s;ed the &s;ame practice, but generally carry'd it &s;o far as to &s;uperinduce a multiplicity of fables, de&s;troy the unity of action, and lo&s;e their readers in an unrea|&s;onable length of time. Nor is it only in the main de&s;ign that they have been unable to add to his in|vention, but they have followed him in every epi|&s;ode and part of &s;tory. If he has given a regular <HI>catalogue</HI> of an <HI>army,</HI> they all draw up their forces
<PB N="362" REF="367">
in the &s;ame order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the &s;ame for Anchi&s;es, and Statius (rather than omit them) de&s;troys the unity of his action for tho&s;e of Archemorus. If Uly&s;&s;es vi&s;it the &s;hades, the Aeneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are &s;ent after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of Calyp&s;o, &s;o is Aeneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be ab&s;ent from the army on the &s;core of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo mu&s;t ab|&s;ent him&s;elf ju&s;t as long, on the like account. If he gives his hero a &s;uit of cele&s;tial armour, Virgil and Ta&s;&s;o make the &s;ame pre&s;ent to theirs. Virgil has not only ob&s;erved this clo&s;e imitation of Ho|mer, but where he had not led the way, &s;upplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the &s;tory of Sinon and the taking of Troy was copied (&s;ays Macrobius) almo&s;t word for word from Pi|&s;ander, as the Loves of Dido and Aeneas are taken from tho&s;e of Medea and Ja&s;on in Apollonius, and &s;everal others in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>To proceed to the <HI>allegorical fable:</HI> If we re|flect upon tho&s;e innumerable knowledges, tho&s;e &s;ecrets of nature and phy&s;ical philo&s;ophy, which Homer is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have wrapp'd up in his <HI>allegories,</HI> what a new and ample &s;cene of wonder may this con&s;ideration afford us? How fer|tile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qua|lifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in
<PB N="363" REF="368">
forms and per&s;ons; and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they &s;hadowed? This is a field in which no &s;ucceeding poets could di&s;pute with Homer; and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in hav|ing enlarged his circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learn|ing changed in following ages, and &s;cience was delivered in a plainer manner; it then became as rea&s;onable in the more modern poets to lay it a&s;ide, as it was in Homer to make u&s;e of it. And per|haps it was no unhappy circum&s;tance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand upon him of &s;o great an invention, as might be capable of furni&s;hing all tho&s;e allegorical parts of a poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>marvellous fable</HI> includes whatever is &s;uper|natural, and e&s;pecially the machines of the Gods. He &s;eems the fir&s;t who brought them into a &s;y&s;tem of machinery for poetry, and &s;uch a one as makes its greate&s;t importance and dignity. For we find tho&s;e authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the Gods, con&s;tantly laying their accu|&s;ation again&s;t Homer as the chief &s;upport of it. But whatever cau&s;e there might be to blame his <HI>machines</HI> in a philo&s;ophical or religious view, they are &s;o perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever &s;ince contented to follow them: None have been able to enlarge the &s;phere of poetry be|yond the limits he has &s;et: Every attempt of this

nature has proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his Gods continue to this day the Gods of poetry.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>characters</HI> of his per&s;ons: And here we &s;hall find no author has ever drawn &s;o many, with &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;urprizing a variety, or given us &s;uch lively and affecting impre&s;&s;ions of them. Every one has &s;omething &s;o &s;ingularly his own, that no painter could have di&s;tingui&s;hed them more by their features, than the Poet has by their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the di&s;tinctions he has ob&s;erved in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The &s;ingle quality of <HI>courage</HI> is wonderfully diver&s;ified in the &s;everal characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and in|tractable; that of Diomede forward, yet li&s;tening to advice and &s;ubject to command: That of Ajax is heavy, and &s;elf-confiding; of Hector active and vigilant: The courage of Agamemnon is in&s;pirited by love of empire and ambition, that of Menelaus mixed with &s;oftne&s;s and tenderne&s;s for his people: We find in Idomeneus a plain direct &s;oldier, in Sar|pedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this ju|dicious and a&s;toni&s;hing diver&s;ity to be found only in the principal quality which con&s;titutes the main of each character, but even in the underparts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example, the main characters of Uly&s;&s;es and Ne&s;tor con&s;i&s;t in <HI>wi&s;dom;</HI> and they are di&s;tinct in this, that the wi&s;dom of one is <HI>arti|ficial</HI>
<PB N="365" REF="370">
and <HI>various,</HI> of the other <HI>natural, open,</HI> and <HI>regular.</HI> But they have, be&s;ides, characters of <HI>courage;</HI> and this quality al&s;o takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence: for one in the war depends &s;till upon <HI>caution,</HI> the other upon <HI>experience.</HI> It would be endle&s;s to produce in&s;tances of the&s;e kinds. The characters of Vir|gil are far from &s;triking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undi&s;tingui&s;h|ed, and where they are marked mo&s;t evidently, affect us not in proportion to tho&s;e of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus &s;eems no way peculiar but as it is in a &s;u|perior degree; and we &s;ee nothing that differences the courage of Mne&s;theus from that of Serge&s;tus, Cloanthus, or the re&s;t. In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an air of impe|tuo&s;ity runs thro' them all; the &s;ame horrid and &s;avage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, etc. They have a parity of cha|racter, which makes them &s;eem brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this track of reflection, if he will pur&s;ue it thro' the <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> writers, he will be convinced how infinitely &s;uperior in this point the invention of Homer was to that of all others.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;peeches</HI> are to be con&s;idered as they flow from the characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or di&s;agree with the manners of tho&s;e
<PB N="366" REF="371">
who utter them. As there is more variety of cha|racters in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> &s;o there is of &s;peeches, than in any other poem. <HI>Every thing in it has man|ners</HI> (as Ari&s;totle expre&s;&s;es it) that is, every thing is acted or &s;poken. It is hardly credible in a work of &s;uch length, how &s;mall a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part is le&s;s in proportion to the narrative; and the &s;peeches often con&s;i&s;t of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally ju&s;t in any per|&s;on's mouth upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion. As many of his per&s;ons have no apparent characters, &s;o ma|ny of his &s;peeches e&s;cape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftner think of the author him&s;elf when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer: All which are the ef|fects of a colder invention, that intere&s;ts us le&s;s in the action de&s;cribed: Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.</P>
<P>If in the next place we take a view of the <HI>&s;enti|ments,</HI> the &s;ame pre&s;iding faculty is eminent in the &s;ublimity and &s;pirit of his thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Ho|mer principally excelled. What were alone &s;uf|ficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his &s;entiments in general, is, that they have &s;o re|markable a parity with tho&s;e of the Scripture: Du|port, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable in&s;tances of this &s;ort. And it is with ju&s;tice an excellent modern writer allows, that if
<PB N="367" REF="372">
Virgil has not &s;o many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not &s;o many that are &s;ublime and noble; and that the Roman author &s;eldom ri&s;es into very a&s;toni&s;hing &s;entiments where he is not fired by the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>If we ob&s;erve his <HI>de&s;criptions, images,</HI> and <HI>&s;i|miles,</HI> we &s;hall find the invention &s;till predomi|nant. To what el&s;e can we a&s;cribe that va&s;t com|prehen&s;ion of images of every &s;ort, where we &s;ee each circum&s;tance of art, and individual of nature &s;ummoned together, by the extent and fecundity of his imagination; to which all things, in their various views, pre&s;ented them&s;elves in an in&s;tant, and had their impre&s;&s;ions taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full pro&s;|pects of things, but &s;everal unexpected peculiari|ties and &s;ide-views, unob&s;erved by any Painter but Homer. Nothing is &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing as the de&s;crip|tions of his battels, which take up no le&s;s than half the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and are &s;upplied with &s;o va&s;t a va|riety of incidents, that no one bears a likene&s;s to another; &s;uch different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the &s;ame manner; and &s;uch a profu&s;ion of noble ideas, that every battle ri&s;es above the la&s;t in greatne&s;s, horror, and con|fu&s;ion. It is certain there is not near that num|ber of images and de&s;criptions in any Epic Poet; though every one has a&s;&s;i&s;ted him&s;elf with a great quantity out of him: And it is evident of Virgil
<PB N="368" REF="373">
e&s;pecially, that he has &s;carce any compari&s;ons which are not drawn from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>If we de&s;cend from hence to the <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> we &s;ee the bright imagination of Homer &s;hining out in the mo&s;t enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction, the fir&s;t who taught that <HI>language of the Gods</HI> to men. His ex|pre&s;&s;ion is like the colouring of &s;ome great ma&s;ters, which di&s;covers it&s;elf to be laid on boldly, and exe|cuted with rapidity. It is indeed the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t glowing imaginable, and touched with the greate&s;t &s;pirit. Ari&s;totle had rea&s;on to &s;ay, He was the only poet who had found out <HI>living words;</HI> there are in him more daring figures and meta|phors than in any good author whatever. An ar|row is <HI>impatient</HI> to be on the wing, a weapon <HI>thir&s;ts</HI> to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like. Yet his expre&s;&s;ion is never too big for the &s;en&s;e, but ju&s;tly great in proportion to it. 'Tis the &s;entiment that &s;wells and fills out the diction, which ri&s;es with it, and forms it&s;elf about it: And in the &s;ame degree that a thought is warmer, an expre&s;&s;ion will be brighter; as that is more &s;trong, this will become more per&s;picuous: Like gla&s;s in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearne&s;s, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more inten&s;e.</P>
<P>To throw his language more out of pro&s;e, Ho|mer &s;eems to have affected the <HI>compound epithets.</HI>
<PB N="369" REF="374">
This was a &s;ort of compo&s;ition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heighten'd the <HI>diction,</HI> but as it a&s;&s;i&s;ted and filled the <HI>numbers</HI> with great|er &s;ound and pomp, and likewi&s;e conduced in &s;ome mea&s;ure to thicken the <HI>images.</HI> On this la&s;t con|&s;ideration I cannot but attribute the&s;e al&s;o to the fruitfulne&s;s of his invention, &s;ince (as he has ma|naged them) they are a &s;ort of &s;upernumerary pic|tures of the per&s;ons or things to which they are joined. We &s;ee the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the land&s;cape of mount Neritus in that of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and &s;o of others, which particular images could not have been in|&s;i&s;ted upon &s;o long as to expre&s;s them in a de&s;crip|tion (tho' but of a &s;ingle line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure. As a Metaphor is a &s;hort &s;imile, one of the&s;e Epithets is a &s;hort de&s;cription.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if we con&s;ider his <HI>ver&s;ification,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible what a &s;hare of prai&s;e is due to his in|vention in that. He was not &s;atisfy'd with his language as he found it &s;ettled in any one part of Greece, but &s;earch'd thro' its differing <HI>dialects</HI> with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers: He con&s;ider'd the&s;e as they had a greater mixture of vowels or con&s;onants, and according|ly employed them as the ver&s;e required either a greater &s;moothne&s;s or &s;trength. What he mo&s;t affected was the <HI>Ionic,</HI> which has a peculiar &s;weet|ne&s;s from its never u&s;ing contractions, and from
<PB N="370" REF="375">
its cu&s;tom of re&s;olving the dipthongs into two &s;yl|lables: &s;o as to make the words open them&s;elves with a more &s;preading and &s;onorous fluency. With this he mingled the <HI>Attic</HI> contractions, the broader <HI>Doric,</HI> and the feebler <HI>Aeolic,</HI> which often rejects its a&s;pirate, or takes off its accent; and compleat|ed this variety by altering &s;ome letters with the li|cence of poetry. Thus his mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of being fetters to his &s;en&s;e, were always in readine&s;s to run along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further repre&s;entation of his notions, in the corre&s;pondence of their &s;ounds to what they &s;ignified. Out of all the&s;e he has derived that harmony, which makes us confe&s;s he had not on|ly the riche&s;t head, but the fine&s;t ear in the world. This is &s;o great a truth, that whoever will but con&s;ult the tune of his ver&s;es, even without under|&s;tanding them (with the &s;ame &s;ort of diligence as we daily &s;ee practi&s;ed in the ca&s;e of Italian Operas) will find more &s;weetne&s;s, variety, and maje&s;ty of &s;ound, than in any other language or poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the criticks to be copied but faintly by Virgil him&s;elf, though they are &s;o ju&s;t to a&s;cribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: Indeed the Greek has &s;ome ad|vantages both from the natural <HI>&s;ound</HI> of its <HI>words,</HI> and the turn and <HI>cadence</HI> of its <HI>ver&s;e,</HI> which agree with the genius of no other language. Virgil was very &s;en&s;ible of this, and u&s;ed the utmo&s;t diligence in working up a more intractable language to
<PB N="371" REF="376">
what&s;oever graces it was capable of; and in parti|cular never failed to bring the &s;ound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its &s;en&s;e. If the Gre|cian poet has not been &s;o frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only rea&s;on is, that fewer criticks have under&s;tood one language than the other. Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this kind, in his treati&s;e of the <HI>Compo&s;ition of Words,</HI> and others will be taken notice of in the cour&s;e of my Notes. It &s;uffices at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve of his numbers, that they flow with &s;o much ea&s;e, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than to tran&s;cribe as fa&s;t as the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> dictated; and at the &s;ame time with &s;o much force and in&s;piriting vigour, that they awaken and rai&s;e us like the &s;ound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plenti|ful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of ver&s;e, the mo&s;t rapid, and yet the mo&s;t &s;mooth imagin|able.</P>
<P>Thus on whatever &s;ide we contemplate Homer, what principally &s;trikes us is his <HI>invention.</HI> It is that which forms the character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>copious</HI> than any other, his manners more <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>&s;trongly marked,</HI> his &s;peeches more <HI>affecting</HI> and <HI>tran&s;ported,</HI> his &s;enti|ments more <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> his images and de|&s;criptions more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> his expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="372" REF="377">
more <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>daring,</HI> and his numbers more <HI>ra|pid</HI> and <HI>various.</HI> I hope, in what has been &s;aid of Virgil, with regard to any of the&s;e heads, I have no way derogated from his character. No|thing is more ab&s;urd or endle&s;s, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an op|po&s;ition of particular pa&s;&s;ages in them, and form|ing a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain know|ledge of the principal character and di&s;tingui&s;hing excellence of each: It is in <HI>that</HI> we are to con&s;ider him, and in proportion to his degree in <HI>that</HI> we are to admire him. No author or man ever ex|celled all the world in more than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in <HI>invention,</HI> Virgil has in <HI>judgment.</HI> Not that we are to think Homer want|ed judgment, becau&s;e Virgil had it in a more emi|nent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, be|cau&s;e Homer po&s;&s;e&s;t a larger &s;hare of it: Each of the&s;e great authors had more of both than perhaps any man be&s;ides, and are only &s;aid to have le&s;s in compari&s;on with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better arti&s;t. In one we mo&s;t admire the man, in the other the work. Ho|mer hurries and tran&s;ports us with a commanding impetuo&s;ity. Virgil leads us with an attractive ma|je&s;ty: Homer &s;catters with a generous profu&s;ion, Virgil be&s;tows with a careful magnificence: Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a bound|le&s;s overflow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with
<PB N="373" REF="378">
a gentle and con&s;tant &s;tream. When we behold their battles, methinks the two Poets re&s;emble the Heroes they celebrate: Homer, boundle&s;s and ir|re&s;i&s;tible as Achilles, bears all before him, and &s;hines more and more as the tumult increa&s;es; Vir|gil, calmly daring like Aeneas, appears undi&s;turb|ed in the mid&s;t of the action; di&s;po&s;es all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, Homer &s;eems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, &s;haking Olympus, &s;cattering the lightnings, and firing the Heavens; Virgil, like the &s;ame power in his benevolence, coun&s;elling with the Gods, laying plans for em|pires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.</P>
<P>But after all, it is with great parts as with great virtues, they naturally border on &s;ome imperfec|tion; and it is often hard to di&s;tingui&s;h exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may &s;ometimes &s;ink to &s;u&s;picion, &s;o may a great judgment decline to coldne&s;s; and as mag|nanimity may run up to profu&s;ion or extravagance, &s;o may a great invention to redundancy or wildne&s;s. If we look upon Homer in this view, we &s;hall perceive the chief <HI>objections</HI> again&s;t him to pro|ceed from &s;o noble a cau&s;e as the exce&s;s of this fa|culty.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e we may reckon &s;ome of his <HI>mar|vellous fictions,</HI> upon which &s;o much critici&s;m has been &s;pent, as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the bounds of proba|bility. Perhaps it may be with great and &s;uperior
<PB N="374" REF="379">
&s;ouls, as with gigantick bodies, which exerting them&s;elves with unu&s;ual &s;trength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and like the old heroes of that make, commit &s;omething near ex|travagance, amid&s;t a &s;eries of glorious and inimit|able performances. Thus Homer has his <HI>&s;peaking hor&s;es,</HI> and Virgil his <HI>myrtles di&s;tilling blood,</HI> where the latter has not &s;o much as contrived the ea&s;y intervention of a Deity to &s;ave the probability.</P>
<P>It is owing to the &s;ame va&s;t invention, that his <HI>Similes</HI> have been thought too exuberant and full of circum&s;tances. The force of this faculty is &s;een in nothing more, than in its inability to confine it&s;elf to that &s;ingle circum&s;tance upon which the compari&s;on is grounded: It runs out into embel|li&s;hments of additional images, which however are &s;o managed as not to overpower the main one. His &s;imiles are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is al&s;o &s;et off with occa&s;ional ornaments and pro&s;pects. The &s;ame will account for his manner of heaping a number of compari|&s;ons together in one breath, when his fancy &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him at once &s;o many various and corre&s;|pondent images. The reader will ea&s;ily extend this ob&s;ervation to more objections of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>If there are others which &s;eem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowne&s;s of genius, than
<PB N="375" REF="380">
an exce&s;s of it; tho&s;e &s;eeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the na|ture of the times he lived in. Such are his <HI>gro&s;|&s;er repre&s;entations</HI> of the <HI>Gods,</HI> and the vicious and <HI>imperfect manners</HI> of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> which will be treated of in the following <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Articles of Theology and Morality, in the third part of the E&s;&s;ay.</NOTE><HI>E&s;&s;ay:</HI> But I mu&s;t here &s;peak a word of the latter, as it is a point general|ly carried into extremes, both by the cen&s;urers and defenders of Homer. It mu&s;t be a &s;trange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madam Da|cier, <Q>&startq;that <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Preface to her Homer.</NOTE>tho&s;e times and manners are &s;o much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.&endq;</Q> Who can be &s;o prejudiced in their fa|vour as to magnify the felicity of tho&s;e ages, when a &s;pirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reign'd thro' the world; when no mercy was &s;hown but for the &s;ake of lucre, when the greate&s;t Princes were put to the &s;word, and their wives and daughters made &s;laves and concubines? On the other &s;ide, I would not be &s;o delicate as tho&s;e modern criticks, who are &s;hocked at the <HI>&s;ervile offices</HI> and mean employ|ments in which we &s;ometimes &s;ee the Heroes of Homer engaged. There is a plea&s;ure in taking a view of that &s;implicity in oppo&s;ition to the luxury of &s;ucceeding ages, in beholding Monarchs with|out their guards, Princes tending their flocks, and
<PB N="376" REF="381">
Prince&s;&s;es drawing water from the &s;prings. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the mo&s;t ancient author in the heathen world; and tho&s;e who con&s;ider him in this light, will double their plea&s;ure in the peru&s;al of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more; that they are &s;tepping almo&s;t three thou&s;and years back into the remote&s;t Antiquity, and entertaining them&s;elves with a clear and &s;urpri&s;ing vi&s;ion of things no where el&s;e to be found, the only true mirrour of that ancient world. By this means alone their greate&s;t ob&s;tacles will vani&s;h; and what u&s;u|ally creates their di&s;like, will become a &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration may further &s;erve to an&s;wer for the con&s;tant u&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>epithets</HI> to his Gods and Heroes, &s;uch as the <HI>far-darting</HI> Phoebus, the <HI>blue-ey'd</HI> Pallas, the <HI>&s;wift-footed</HI> Achilles, etc. which &s;ome have cen&s;ured as impertinent and te|diou&s;ly repeated. Tho&s;e of the Gods depended upon the powers and offices then believ'd to be|long to them, and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and &s;olemn devotions in which they were u&s;ed: they were a &s;ort of attri|butes with which it was a matter of religion to &s;a|lute them on all occa&s;ions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mon&s;. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of <HI>Surnames,</HI> and repeated as &s;uch;
<PB N="377" REF="382">
for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add &s;ome other di&s;tinc|tion of each per&s;on; either naming his parents expre&s;ly, or his place of birth, profe&s;&s;ion, or the like: As Alexander the &s;on of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarna&s;&s;us, Diogenes the Cynic, etc. Ho|mer therefore complying with the cu&s;tom of his country, u&s;ed &s;uch di&s;tinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And indeed we have &s;ome|thing parallel to the&s;e in modern times, &s;uch as the names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Iron&s;ide, Ed|ward Long-&s;hanks, Edward the Black Prince, etc. If yet this be thought to account better for the pro|priety than for the repetition, I &s;hall add a further conjecture. He&s;iod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one, of <HI>Heroes di&s;tinct from other men, a divine race, who fought at</HI> Thebes <HI>and</HI> Troy, <HI>are called Demi-Gods, and live by the care of</HI> Jupiter <HI>in the i&s;lands of the ble&s;&s;ed</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">He&s;iod, Op. et Dier. lib. i. &vers; 155, etc.</NOTE>. Now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this al&s;o in common with the Gods, not to be mentioned without the &s;olemnity of an epithet, and &s;uch as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their families, actions, or qualities.</P>
<P>What other cavils have been rai&s;ed again&s;t Ho|mer, are &s;uch as hardly de&s;erve a reply, but will
<PB N="378" REF="383">
yet be taken notice of as they occur in the cour&s;e of the work. Many have been occa&s;ioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the &s;ame, as if one &s;hould think to rai&s;e the &s;uper&s;tructure by undermining the foundation: One would imagine by the whole cour&s;e of their parallels, that the&s;e Criticks never &s;o much as heard of Homer's having written fir&s;t; a con&s;ide|ration which whoever compares the&s;e two Poets, ought to have always in his eye. Some accu&s;e him for the &s;ame things which they overlook or prai&s;e in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Aeneis to tho&s;e of the Iliad, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons which might &s;et the Ody&s;&s;ey above the Aeneis: as that the Hero is a wi&s;er man; and the action of the one more beneficial to his coun|try than that of the other: Or el&s;e they blame him for not doing what he never de&s;igned; as becau&s;e Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Aeneas, when the very moral of his poem requir|ed a contrary character: It is thus that Rapin judges in his compari&s;on of Homer and Virgil. Others &s;elect tho&s;e particular pa&s;&s;ages of Homer, which are not &s;o laboured as &s;ome that Virgil drew out of them: This is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetice. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ometimes thro' a fal&s;e delicacy and refinement, oftner from an ignorance of the graces of the original; and then triumph in the aukwardne&s;s of their own

tran&s;lations: This is the conduct of Perault in his Parallels. La&s;tly, there are others, who, pretend|ing to a fairer proceeding, di&s;tingui&s;h between the per&s;onal merit of Homer, and that of his <HI>work;</HI> but when they come to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;es of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of tho&s;e that followed: And in pur&s;uance of this principle, they make tho&s;e accidents (&s;uch as the contention of the cities, etc.) to be the cau&s;es of his fame, which were in reality the con&s;equences of his merit. The &s;ame might as well be &s;aid of Virgil, or any great author, who&s;e general cha|racter will infallibly rai&s;e many ca&s;ual additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mon&s;. de la Motte; who yet confe&s;&s;es upon the whole, that in whatever age Homer had lived, he mu&s;t have been the greate&s;t poet of his nation, and that he may be &s;aid in this &s;en&s;e to be the ma&s;ter even of tho&s;e who &s;urpa&s;s'd him.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e objections we &s;ee nothing that con|tradicts his title to the honour of the chief <HI>Inven|tion;</HI> and as long as this (which is indeed the cha|racteri&s;tic of Poetry it&s;elf) remains unequal'd by his followers, he &s;till continues &s;uperior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of <HI>one &s;ort</HI> of Criticks: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loude&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al applau&s;es, which holds the heart of a reader under the &s;tronge&s;t enchantment.

Homer not only appears the Inventor of poetry, but excells all the inventors of other arts in this, that he has &s;wallow'd up the honour of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him. What he has done admitted no increa&s;e, it only left room for contraction or regu|lation. He &s;hewed all the &s;tretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in &s;ome of his flights, it was but becau&s;e he attempted every thing. A work of this kind &s;eems like a mighty Tree which ri&s;es from the mo&s;t vigorous &s;eed, is improved with in|du&s;try, flouri&s;hes, and produces the fine&s;t fruit; nature and art con&s;pire to rai&s;e it; plea&s;ure and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the ju&s;te&s;t faults, have only &s;aid, that a few branches (which run luxuriant thro' a richne&s;s of nature) might be lopp'd into form to give it a more regu|lar appearance.</P>
<P>Having now &s;poken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the tran&s;la|tion, with the &s;ame view to the chief characteri&s;|tic. As far as <HI>that</HI> is &s;een in the main parts of the Poem, &s;uch as the fable, manners, and &s;enti|ments, no tran&s;lator can prejudice it but by wilful omi&s;&s;ions or contractions. As it al&s;o breaks out in every particular image, de&s;cription, and &s;imile; whoever le&s;&s;ens or too much &s;oftens tho&s;e, takes off from this chief character. It is the fir&s;t grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and un|maim'd; and for the re&s;t, the diction and ver&s;ifi|cation
<PB N="381" REF="386">
only are his proper province; &s;ince the&s;e mu&s;t be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</P>
<P>It &s;hould then be con&s;ider'd what methods may afford &s;ome equivalent in our language for the graces of the&s;e in the Greek. It is certain no lite|ral tran&s;lation can be ju&s;t to an excellent original in a &s;uperior language: but it is a great mi&s;take to imagine (as many have done) that a ra&s;h para|phra&s;e can make amends for this general defect; which is no le&s;s in danger to lo&s;e the &s;pirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expre&s;&s;ion. If there be &s;ometimes a darkne&s;s, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better pre&s;erves than a ver&s;ion almo&s;t literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary for transfu&s;ing the &s;pirit of the origi|nal, and &s;upporting the poetical &s;tyle of the tran&s;la|tion: And I will venture to &s;ay, there have not been more men mi&s;led in former times by a &s;ervile dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical in&s;olent hope of rai&s;ing and improving their author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>fire</HI> of the poem is what a tran&s;lator &s;hould principally regard, as it is mo&s;t likely to expire in his managing: However, it is his &s;afe&s;t way to be content with pre&s;erving this to his utmo&s;t in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular place. 'Tis a great &s;ecret in writing to know when to be plain,
<PB N="382" REF="387">
and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow mo|de&s;tly in his foot&s;teps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us rai&s;e ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of in|curring the cen&s;ure of a mere Engli&s;h Critick. Nothing that belongs to Homer &s;eems to have been more commonly mi&s;taken than the ju&s;t pitch of his &s;tyle: Some of his tran&s;lators having &s;welled into &s;u&s;tian in a proud confidence of the <HI>&s;ublime;</HI> others &s;unk into flatne&s;s in a cold and timorous no|tion of <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> Methinks I &s;ee the&s;e different followers of Homer, &s;ome &s;weating and &s;training after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain &s;igns of fal&s;e mettle) others &s;lowly and &s;ervilely creeping in his train, while the Poet him&s;elf is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal maje&s;ty before them. However, of the two ex|treams one could &s;ooner pardon frenzy than frigi|dity: No author is to be envied for &s;uch commen|dations as he may gain by that character of &s;tyle, which his friends mu&s;t agree together to call <HI>&s;im|plicity,</HI> and the re&s;t of the world will call <HI>dulne&s;s.</HI> There is a graceful and dignify'd &s;implicity, as well as a bald and &s;ordid one, which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a &s;loven: 'Tis one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dre&s;&s;ed at all. Simplicity is the mean between o&s;tentation and ru&s;ticity.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="388">
This pure and noble &s;implicity is no where in &s;uch perfection as in the <HI>Scripture</HI> and our Author. One may affirm, with all re&s;pect to the in&s;pired writings, that the <HI>divine Spirit</HI> made u&s;e of no other words but what were intelligible and com|mon to men at that time, and in that part of the world; and as Homer is the author neare&s;t to tho&s;e, his &s;tyle mu&s;t of cour&s;e bear a greater re|&s;emblance to the &s;acred books than that of any other writer. This con&s;ideration (together with what has been ob&s;erved of the parity of &s;ome of his thoughts) may methinks induce a tran&s;lator on the one hand, to give into &s;everal of tho&s;e general phra&s;es and manners of expre&s;&s;ion, which have at|tain'd a veneration even in our language from be|ing u&s;ed in the Old Te&s;tament; as on the other, to avoid tho&s;e which have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner con&s;ign'd to my&s;tery and religion.</P>
<P>For a further pre&s;ervation of this air of &s;impli|city, a particular care &s;hould be taken to expre&s;s with all plainne&s;s tho&s;e <HI>moral &s;entences</HI> and <HI>prover|bial &s;peeches</HI> which are &s;o numerous in this Poet. They have &s;omething venerable, and as I may &s;ay oracular, in that unadorn'd gravity and &s;hortne&s;s with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lo&s;t by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphra&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="389">
Perhaps the mixture of &s;ome Greci&s;ms and old words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a ver&s;ion of this particular work, which mo&s;t of any other &s;eems to require a venerable antique ca&s;t. But certainly the u&s;e of modern terms of war and government, &s;uch as <HI>platoon, campagne, junto,</HI> or the like (into which &s;ome of his tran|&s;lators have fallen) cannot be allowable; tho&s;e only excepted, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to treat the &s;ubjects in any living language.</P>
<P>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction which are a &s;ort of <HI>marks</HI> or <HI>moles,</HI> by which every common eye di&s;tingui&s;hes him at fir&s;t &s;ight: Tho&s;e who are not his greate&s;t admirers look upon them as defects; and tho&s;e who are, &s;eem plea&s;ed with them as beauties. I &s;peak of his <HI>compound epithets,</HI> and of his <HI>repetitions.</HI> Many of the former can|not be done literally into Engli&s;h without de&s;troy|ing the purity of our language. I believe &s;uch &s;hould be retained as &s;lide ea&s;ily of them&s;elves into an Engli&s;h compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of compo&s;ition; as well as tho&s;e which have received a &s;anction from the au|thority of our be&s;t Poets, and are become fami|liar thro' their u&s;e of them; &s;uch as the <HI>cloud-com|pelling</HI> Jove, etc. As for the re&s;t, whenever any can be as fully and &s;ignificantly expre&s;t in a &s;ingle word as in a compounded one, the cour&s;e to be taken is obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="390">
Some that cannot be &s;o turned as to pre&s;erve their full image by one or two words, may have ju&s;tice done them by circumlocution; as the epi|thet <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> to a mountain, would appear lit|tle or ridiculous tran&s;lated literally <HI>leaf-&s;haking,</HI> but affords a maje&s;tic idea in the <HI>periphra&s;is: The lofty mo$ntain &s;hakes his waving woods.</HI> Others that ad|mit of differing &s;ignifications, may receive an ad|vantage by a judicious variation, according to the occa&s;ions on which they are introduced. For ex|ample, the epithet of Apollo, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>far|&s;hooting,</HI> is capable of two explications; one lite|ral in re&s;pect of the darts and bow, the en&s;ign of that God; the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the &s;un: Therefore in &s;uch places where Apollo is repre&s;ented as a God in per&s;on, I would u&s;e the former interpretation; and where the ef|fects of the &s;un are de&s;cribed, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the &s;ame epithets which we find in Homer, and which, tho' it might be accommodated (as has been already &s;hewn) to the ear of tho&s;e times, is by no means &s;o to ours: But one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional beauty from the occa&s;ions on which they are em|ploy'd; and in doing this properly, a tran&s;lator may at once &s;hew his fancy and his judgment.</P>
<P>As for Homer's <HI>Repetitions,</HI> we may divide them into three &s;orts, of whole narrations and &s;peeches,
<PB N="386" REF="391">
of &s;ingle &s;entences, and of one ver&s;e or hemi&s;tich. I hope it is not impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;uch a regard to the&s;e, as neither to lo&s;e &s;o known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not un|graceful in tho&s;e &s;peeches where the dignity of the &s;peaker renders it a &s;ort of in&s;olence to alter his words; as in the me&s;&s;ages from Gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of &s;tate, or where the ceremonial of religion &s;eems to require it, in the &s;olemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other ca&s;es, I believe the be&s;t rule is to be guided by the nearne&s;s, or di&s;tance, at which the repetitions are placed in the original: When they follow too clo&s;e, one may vary the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, but it is a que&s;tion whether a profe&s;&s;ed tran&s;lator be authorized to omit any: If they be tedious, the author is to an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>It only remains to &s;peak of the <HI>Ver&s;ification.</HI> Homer (as has been &s;aid) is perpetually applying the &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e, and varying it on every new &s;ubject. This is indeed one of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in Latin. I am &s;en&s;ible it is what may &s;ometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully po&s;&s;e&s;t of his image: however it may be rea&s;onably believed they de&s;ign|ed this, in who&s;e ver&s;e it &s;o manife&s;tly appears in a &s;uperior degree to all others. Few readers have
<PB N="387" REF="392">
the ear to be judges of it; but tho&s;e who have, will &s;ee I have endeavour'd at this beauty.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf utterly incapable of doing ju&s;tice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may en|tertain without much vanity, of giving a more to|lerable copy of him than any entire tran&s;lation in ver&s;e has yet done. We have only tho&s;e of Chap|man, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immea&s;urable length of ver&s;e, notwith&s;tanding which, there is &s;carce any para|phra&s;e more loo&s;e and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four or &s;ix lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Ody&s;&s;ey, &vers; 312. where he has &s;pun twenty ver&s;es out of two. He is often mi&s;taken in &s;o bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on pur|po&s;e, if he did not in other places of his notes in|&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a &s;trong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author, in&s;omuch as to pro|mi&s;e in his rhyming preface, a poem of the my&s;|teries he had revealed in Homer: and perhaps he endeavoured to &s;train the obvious &s;en&s;e to this end. His expre&s;&s;ion is involved in fu&s;tian, a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of Bu&s;&s;y d'Amboi&s;e, etc. In a word, the nature of the man may account for his whole performance; for he appears from his pre|face and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn,
<PB N="388" REF="393">
and an enthu&s;ia&s;t in poetry. His own boa&s;t of having fini&s;hed half the Iliad in le&s;s than fifteen weeks, &s;hews with what negligence his ver&s;ion was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his de|fects, is a daring firey &s;pirit that animates his tran&s;|lation, which is &s;omething like what one might imagine Homer him&s;elf would have writ before he arrived at years of di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the &s;en&s;e in general, but for particulars and circum|&s;tances he continually lops them, and often omits the mo&s;t beautiful. As for its being e&s;teemed a clo&s;e tran&s;lation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the &s;hortne&s;s of it, which pro|ceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the contractions above-mentioned. He &s;ometimes omits whole &s;imiles and &s;entences, and is now and then guilty of mi&s;takes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but thro' carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. His poetry, as well as Ogil|by's, is too mean for critici&s;m.</P>
<P>It is a great lo&s;s to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to tran&s;late the Iliad. He has left us only the fir&s;t book, and a &s;mall part of the &s;ixth; in which if he has in &s;ome places not truly interpreted the &s;en&s;e, or pre&s;erved the antiquities, it ought to be excu&s;ed on account of the ha&s;te he was obliged to write in. He &s;eems to have had too much regard to Chapman, who&s;e words he
<PB N="389" REF="394">
&s;ometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in pa&s;&s;ages where he wanders from the original. However, had he tran&s;lated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil, his ver&s;ion of whom (notwith&s;tand|ing &s;ome human errors) is the mo&s;t noble and &s;pi|rited tran&s;lation I know in any language. But the fate of great genius's is like that of great mini&s;ters, tho' they are confe&s;&s;edly the fir&s;t in the common|wealth of letters, they mu&s;t be envy'd and calum|niated only for being at the head of it.</P>
<P>That which in my opinion ought to be the en|deavour of any one who tran&s;lates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that &s;pirit and fire which makes his chief character: In particular places, where the &s;en&s;e can bear any doubt, to follow the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t poetical, as mo&s;t agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his &s;tyle, and the different modulations of his numbers; to pre&s;erve, in the more active or de|&s;criptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more &s;edate or narrative, a plainne&s;s and &s;olemnity; in the &s;peeches, a fullne&s;s and per&s;picuity; in the &s;en|tences, a &s;hortne&s;s and gravity: Not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor &s;ometimes the very ca&s;t of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or cu&s;toms of anti|quity: Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a &s;horter compa&s;s, than has hitherto been done by any tran&s;lator, who has tolerably pre&s;erved ei|ther
<PB N="390" REF="395">
the &s;en&s;e or poetry. What I would further recommend to him, is to &s;tudy his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned &s;oever, or whatever figure they may make in the e&s;timation of the world; to con&s;ider him attentively in compari&s;on with Virgil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the mo|derns. Next the&s;e, the Archbi&s;hop of Cambr$y's Telemachus may give him th$ true&s;t idea of the &s;pirit and turn of our author, and Bo&s;&s;$'s admira|ble treati&s;e of the Epic poem the ju&s;te&s;t notion of his de&s;ign and conduct. But after all, with what|ever judgment and &s;tudy a man may proceed, or with whatever happine&s;s he may perform &s;uch a work, he mu&s;t hope to plea&s;e but a few; tho&s;e only who have at once a ta&s;te of poetry, and com|petent learning. For to &s;atisfy &s;uch as want ei|ther, is not in the nature of this undertaking; &s;ince a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not <HI>modern,</HI> and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</P>
<P>What I have done is &s;ubmitted to the publick, from who&s;e opinions I am prepared to learn; tho' I fear no judges &s;o little as our be&s;t poets, who are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the weight of this ta&s;k. As for the wor&s;t, whatever they &s;hall plea&s;e to &s;ay, they may give me &s;ome concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in this tran&s;lation by judgments very different from theirs, and by per&s;ons for whom they can have no kindne&s;s, if an old ob&s;ervation
<PB N="391" REF="396">
be true, that the &s;tronge&s;t antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addi&s;on was the fir&s;t who&s;e advice determined me to undertake this ta&s;k, who was plea&s;ed to write to me upon that occa&s;ion in &s;uch terms, as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my un|dertaking to the publick. Dr. Swift promoted my intere&s;t with that warmth with which he always &s;erves his friend. The humanity and frankne&s;s of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occa&s;ion. I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge with infinite plea&s;ure, the many friendly offices, as well as &s;incere critici&s;ms of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in tran&s;lating &s;ome parts of Homer. I mu&s;t add the names of Mr. Rowe and Dr. Parnell, though I &s;hall take a further opportunity of doing ju&s;tice to the la&s;t, who&s;e good-nature (to give it a great panegyrick) is no le&s;s exten&s;ive than his learning. The favour of the&s;e gentlemen is not entirely unde&s;erved by one who bears them &s;o true an affection. But what can I &s;ay of the honour &s;o many of the <HI>Great</HI> have done me, while the <HI>fir&s;t names</HI> of the age appear as my &s;ub&s;cribers, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers.

it known that he was plea&s;ed to promote this affair.

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE Works of SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my de&s;ign to enter into a critici&s;m upon this author; tho' to do it effectually and not &s;uperficially, would be the be&s;t occa&s;ion that any ju&s;t writer could take, to form the judgment and ta&s;te of our nation. For of all Engli&s;h poets Shake&s;pear mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be the faire&s;t and fulle&s;t &s;ubject for critici&s;m, and to afford the mo&s;t numerous, as well as mo&s;t con&s;picuous in&s;tances, both of beauties and faults of all &s;orts. But this far exceeds the bounds of a Preface, the bu&s;ine&s;s of which is only to give an account of the fate of his works, and the di&s;advantages under which they have been tran&s;mitted to us. We &s;hall here|by extenuate many faults which are his, and clear him from the imputation of many which are not: A de&s;ign, which though it can be no guide to future criticks to do him ju&s;tice in one way, will at lea&s;t be &s;ufficient to prevent their doing him an inju&s;tice in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="400">
I cannot however but mention &s;ome of his prin|cipal and characteri&s;tic excellencies, for which (notwith&s;tanding his defects) he is ju&s;tly and uni|ver&s;ally elevated above all other dramatick Writers. Not that this is the proper place of prai&s;ing him, but becau&s;e I would not omit any occa&s;ion of doing it.</P>
<P>If ever any author de&s;erved the name of an <HI>Ori|ginal,</HI> it was Shake&s;pear. Homer him&s;elf drew not his art &s;o immediately from the fountains of Nature; it proceeded thro' Aegyptian &s;trainers and channels, and came to him not without &s;ome tincture of the learning, or &s;ome ca&s;t of the mo|dels, of tho&s;e before him. The poetry of Shake|&s;pear was in&s;piration indeed: he is not &s;o much an Imitator, as an In&s;trument, of Nature; and 'tis not &s;o ju&s;t to &s;ay that he &s;peaks from her, as that &s;he &s;peaks thro' him.</P>
<P>His <HI>Characters</HI> are &s;o much Nature her&s;elf, that 'tis a &s;ort of injury to call them by &s;o di&s;tant a name as copies of her. Tho&s;e of other Poets have a con&s;tant re&s;emblance, which &s;hews that they received them from one another, and were but multipliers of the &s;ame image: each picture like a mock-rainbow is but the reflexion of a re|flexion. But every &s;ingle character in Shake&s;pear is as much an individual, as tho&s;e in life it&s;elf; it is as impo&s;&s;ible to find any two alike; and &s;uch as from their relation or affinity in any re&s;pect ap|pear mo&s;t to be twins, will upon compari&s;on be found remarkably di&s;tinct. To this life and va|riety
<PB N="396" REF="401">
of character, we mu&s;t add the wonderful pre|&s;ervation of it; which is &s;uch throughout his Plays, that, had all the &s;peeches been printed without the very names of the per&s;ons, I believe one might have applied them with certainty to every &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The <HI>Power</HI> over our <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> was never po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in a more eminent degree, or di&s;played in &s;o dif|ferent in&s;tances. Yet all along, there is &s;een no labour, no pains to rai&s;e them; no preparation to guide our gue&s;s to the effect, or be perceiv'd to lead toward it: But the heart &s;wells, and the tears bur&s;t out, ju&s;t at the proper places: We are &s;urprized the moment we weep; and yet upon re|flection find the pa&s;&s;ion &s;o ju&s;t, that we &s;hould be &s;urprized if we had not wept, and wept at that very moment.</P>
<P>How a&s;toni&s;hing is it again, that the Pa&s;&s;ions directly oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, Laughter and Spleen, are no le&s;s at his command! that he is not more a ma&s;ter of the <HI>great</HI> than of the <HI>ridiculous</HI> in hu|man nature; of our noble&s;t tenderne&s;&s;es, than of our vaine&s;t foibles; of our &s;tronge&s;t emotions, than of our idle&s;t &s;en&s;ations!</P>
<P>Nor does he only excel in the Pa&s;&s;ions: in the coolne&s;s of Reflection and Rea&s;oning he is full as admirable. His <HI>Sentiments</HI> are not only in gene|ral the mo&s;t pertinent and judicious upon every &s;ubject; but by a talent very peculiar, &s;omething between penetration and felicity, he hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each argu|ment
<PB N="397" REF="402">
turns, or the force of each motive depends. This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no edu|cation or experience in tho&s;e great and publick &s;cenes of life which are u&s;ually the &s;ubject of his thoughts: So that he &s;eems to have known the world by intuition, to have looked thro' human nature at one glance, and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new opinion, That the philo&s;opher and even the man of the world, may be <HI>born,</HI> as well as the poet.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that with all the&s;e great ex|cellencies, he has almo&s;t as great defects; and that as he has certainly written better, &s;o he has per|haps written wor&s;e, than any other. But I think I can in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the&s;e defects, from &s;everal cau&s;es and accidents; without which it is hard to imagine that &s;o large and &s;o enlight|ened a mind could ever have been &s;u&s;ceptible of them. That all the&s;e contingencies &s;hould unite to his di&s;advantage &s;eems to me almo&s;t as &s;ingularly unlucky, as that &s;o many various (nay contrary) talents &s;hould meet in one man, was happy and extraordinary.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed that Stage-poetry of all other, is more particularly levelled to plea&s;e the <HI>populace,</HI> and its &s;ucce&s;s more immediately depend|ing upon the <HI>common &s;uffrage.</HI> One cannot there|fore wonder, if Shake&s;pear, having at his fir&s;t ap|pearance no other aim in his writings than to pro|cure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, directed his endeavours &s;olely
<PB N="398" REF="403">
to hit the ta&s;te and humour that then prevailed. The audience was generally compo&s;ed of the meaner &s;ort of people; and therefore the images of life were to be drawn from tho&s;e of their own rank: accordingly we find, that not our author's only, but almo&s;t all the old comedies have their &s;cene among <HI>Trade&s;men</HI> and <HI>Mechanicks:</HI> And even their hi&s;torical plays &s;tricly follow the common <HI>old &s;tories</HI> or <HI>vulgar traditions</HI> of that kind of peo|ple. In Tragedy, nothing was &s;o &s;ure to <HI>&s;urprize</HI> and cau&s;e <HI>admiration,</HI> as the mo&s;t &s;trange, unex|pected, and con&s;equently mo&s;t unnatural, events and incidents; the mo&s;t exaggerated thoughts; the mo&s;t verbo&s;e and bomba&s;t expre&s;&s;ion; the mo&s;t pompous rhymes, and thundering ver&s;ification. In Comedy, nothing was &s;o &s;ure to <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> as mean buffoonry, vile ribaldry, and unmannerly je&s;ts of fools and clowns. Yet even in the&s;e, our author's wit buoys up, and is born above his &s;ubject: his genius in tho&s;e low parts is like &s;ome prince of a romance in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;hepherd or pea&s;ant; a certain greatne&s;s and &s;pirit now and then break out, which manife&s;t his higher extraction and qualities.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only the common audience had no notion of the rules of writing, but few even of the better &s;ort piqued them&s;elves upon any great degree of knowledge or nicety that way; 'till Ben John&s;on, getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="399" REF="404">
&s;tage, brought critical learning into vogue: And that this was not done without difficulty, may ap|pear from tho&s;e frequent le&s;&s;ons (and indeed al|mo&s;t declamations) which he was forced to prefix to his fir&s;t plays, and put into the mouth of his actors, the <HI>Grex, Chorus,</HI> etc. to remove the pre|judices, and inform the judgment of his hearers. 'Till then, our authors had no thoughts of writ|ing on the model of the ancients: their Tragedies were only hi&s;tories in dialogue; and their come|dies followed the thread of any novel as they found it, no le&s;s implicitly than if it had been true hi&s;|tory.</P>
<P>To judge therefore of Shake&s;pear by Ari&s;totle's rules, is like trying a man by the laws of one country, who acted under tho&s;e of another. He writ to the <HI>people;</HI> and writ at fir&s;t without patro|nage from the better &s;ort, and therefore without aims of plea&s;ing them: without a&s;&s;i&s;tance or ad|vice from the learned, as without the advantage of education or acquaintance among them: with|out that knowledge of the be&s;t models, the anci|ents, to in&s;pire him with an emulation of them: in a word, without any views of reputation, and of what poets are plea&s;ed to call immortality: Some or all of which have encouraged the vanity, or ani|mated the ambition, of other writers.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that when his perfor|mances had merited the protection of his prince, and when the encouragement of the court had &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="400" REF="405">
to that of the town; the works of his ri|per years are manife&s;tly rai&s;ed above tho&s;e of his former. The dates of his plays &s;ufficiently evi|dence that his productions improved, in propor|tion to the re&s;pect he had for his auditors. And I make no doubt this ob&s;ervation would be found true in every in&s;tance, were but editions extant from which we might learn the exact time when every piece was compo&s;ed, and whether writ for the town, or the court.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e (and no le&s;s &s;trong than the former) may be deduced from our Author's being a <HI>player,</HI> and forming him&s;elf fir&s;t upon the judg|ments of that body of men whereof he was a mem|ber. They have ever had a &s;tandard to them&s;elves, upon other principles than tho&s;e of Ari&s;totle. As they live by the majority, they know no rule but that of plea&s;ing the pre&s;ent humour, and comply|ing with the wit in fa&s;hion; a con&s;ideration which brings all their judgment to a &s;hort point. Players are ju&s;t &s;uch judges of what is <HI>right,</HI> as taylors are of what is <HI>graceful.</HI> And in this view it will be but fair to allow, that mo&s;t of our Author's faults are le&s;s to be a&s;cribed to his wrong judgment as a Poet, than to his right judgment as a Player.</P>
<P>By the&s;e men it was thought a prai&s;e to Shake|&s;pear, that he &s;carce ever <HI>blotted a line.</HI> This they indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, as appears from what we are told by Ben John&s;on in his <HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> and from the preface of Heminges and Condell to the
<PB N="401" REF="406">
fir&s;t folio edition. But in reality (however it has prevailed) there never was a more groundle&s;s re|port, or to the contrary of which there are more undeniable evidences. As the Comedy of the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> which he entirely new writ; the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Henry</HI> VI. which was fir&s;t publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>the Contention of York and Lanca&s;ter:</HI> and that of <HI>Henry</HI> V. extreme|ly improved; that of <HI>Hamlet</HI> enlarged to almo&s;t as much again as at fir&s;t, and many others. I be|lieve the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground. This too might be thought a prai&s;e by &s;ome, and to this his er|rors have as injudiciou&s;ly been a&s;cribed by others. For tis certain, were it true, it could concern but a &s;mall part of them; the mo&s;t are &s;uch as are not properly defects, but &s;uperfoetations; and ari&s;e not from want of learning or reading, but from want of thinking or judging: or rather (to be more ju&s;t to our Author) from a compliance to tho&s;e wants in others. As to a wrong choice of the &s;ubject, a wrong conduct of the incidents, fal&s;e thoughts, forced expre&s;&s;ions, etc. if the&s;e are not to be a&s;cribed to the fore&s;aid accidental rea|&s;ons, they mu&s;t be charged upon the poet him&s;elf, and there is no help for it. But I think the two di&s;advantages which I have mentioned (to be oblig|ed to plea&s;e the lowe&s;t of people, and to keep the wor&s;t of company) if the con&s;ideration be extend|ed as far as it rea&s;onably may, will appear &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="402" REF="407">
to mi&s;lead and depre&s;s the greate&s;t Genius up|on earth. Nay the more mode&s;ty with which &s;uch a one is endued, the more he is in danger of &s;ubmitting and conforming to others, again&s;t his own better judgment.</P>
<P>But as to his <HI>want of learning,</HI> it may be nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething more: There is certainly a va&s;t difference between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>languages.</HI> How far he was ignorant of the latter, I cannot determine; but 'tis plain he had much reading at lea&s;t, if they will not call it learning, Nor is it any great matter, if a man has knowledge, whe|ther he has it from one language or from another. Nothing is more evident than that he had a ta&s;te of natural philo&s;ophy, mechanicks, ancient and modern hi&s;tory, poetical learning and mythology: We find him very knowing in the cu&s;toms, rites, and manners of antiquity. In <HI>Coriolanus</HI> and <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> not only the &s;pirit, but manners, of the Romans are exactly drawn; and &s;till a nicer di&s;tinction is &s;hown, between the manners of the Romans in the time of the former, and of the lat|ter. His reading in the ancient hi&s;torians is no le&s;s con&s;picuous, in many references to particular pa&s;&s;ages: and the &s;peeches copied from Plutarch in <HI>Coriolanus</HI> may, I think, as well be made an in&s;tance of his learning, as tho&s;e copied from Ci|cero in <HI>Catiline,</HI> of Ben John&s;on's. The manners of other nations in general, the Egyptians, Vene|tains, French, etc. are drawn with equal propriety.
<PB N="403" REF="408">
Whatever object of nature, or branch of &s;cience, he either &s;peaks of or de&s;cribes; it is always with competent, if not exten&s;ive knowledge: his de|&s;criptions are &s;till exact; all his metaphors appro|priated, and remarkably drawn from the true na|ture and inherent qualities of each &s;ubject. When he treats of ethic or politic, we may con&s;tantly ob&s;erve a wonderful ju&s;tne&s;s of di&s;tinction, as well as extent of comprehen&s;ion. No one is more a ma&s;ter of the poetical &s;tory, or has more frequent allu&s;ions to the various parts of it: Mr. Waller (who has been celebrated for this la&s;t particular) has not &s;hewn more learning this way than Shake|&s;pear. We have tran&s;lations from Ovid publi&s;hed in his name, among tho&s;e poems which pa&s;s for his, and for &s;ome of which we have undoubted authority (being publi&s;hed by him&s;elf, and dedi|cated to his noble patron the Earl of Southampton:) He appears al&s;o to have been conver&s;ant in Plautus, from whom he has taken the plot of one of his plays: he follows the Greek authors, and parti|cularly Dares Phrygius, in another: (altho' I will not pretend to &s;ay in what language he read them.) The modern Italian writers of novels he was mani|fe&s;tly acquainted with; and we may conclude him to be no le&s;s conver&s;ant with the ancients of his own country, from the u&s;e he has made of Chau|cer in <HI>Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> and in the <HI>Two noble Kin&s;men,</HI> if that Play be his, as there goes a tra|dition it was (and indeed it has little re&s;emblance
<PB N="404" REF="409">
of Fletcher, and more of our Author than &s;ome of tho&s;e which have been received as genuine.)</P>
<P>I am inclined to think, this opinion proceeded originally from the zeal of the Partizans of our Au|thor and Ben John&s;on; as they endeavoured to ex|alt the one at the expence of the other. It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and no|thing is &s;o probable, as that becau&s;e Ben John&s;on had much the more learning, it was &s;aid on the one hand that Shake&s;pear had none at all; and be|cau&s;e Shake&s;pear had much the mo&s;t wit and fan|cy, it was retorted on the other, that John&s;on wanted both. Becau&s;e Shake&s;pear borrowed no|thing, it was &s;aid that Ben John&s;on borrowed every thing. Becau&s;e John&s;on did not write extempore, he was reproached with being a year about every piece; and becau&s;e Shake&s;pear wrote with ea&s;e and rapidity, they cried, he never once made a blot. Nay the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition ran &s;o high, that whatever tho&s;e of the one &s;ide objected to the other, was taken at the rebound, and turned into prai&s;es; as injudiciou&s;ly, as their antagoni&s;ts before had made them objections.</P>
<P>Poets are always afraid of envy; but &s;ure they have as much rea&s;on to be afraid of admiration. They are the Scylla and Charybdis of Authors; tho&s;e who e&s;cape one, often fall by the other. <HI>Pe&s;&s;imum genus inimicorum laudantes,</HI> &s;ays Tacitus: and Virgil de&s;ires to wear a charm again&s;t tho&s;e who prai&s;e a poet without rule or rea&s;on.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="405" REF="410">
<L>Si ultra placitum laud&acirc;rit, baccare frontem Cingito, ne vati noceat.</L></Q>
But however this contention might be carried on by the Partizans on either &s;ide, I cannot help think|ing the&s;e two great poets were good friends, and lived on amicable terms, and in offices of &s;ociety with each other. It is an acknowledged fact, that Ben John&s;on was introduced upon the &s;tage, and his fir&s;t works encouraged, by Shake&s;pear. And after his death, that Author writes <HI>To the memory of his beloved Mr.</HI> William Shake&s;pear, which &s;hews as if the friend&s;hip had continued thro' life. I cannot for my own part find any thing <HI>invidious</HI> or <HI>&s;paring</HI> in tho&s;e ver&s;es, but wonder Mr. Dryden was of that opinion. He exalts him not only above all his contemporaries, but above Chaucer and Spen&s;er, whom he will not allow to be great enough to be ranked with him; and challenges the names of Sophocles, Euripides, and Ae&s;chylus, nay all Greece and Rome at once, to equal him; and (which is very particular) expre&s;ly vindicates him from the imputation of wanting <HI>art,</HI> not en|during that all his excellencies &s;hould be attributed to <HI>nature.</HI> It is remarkable too, that the prai&s;e he gives him in his <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> &s;eems to proceed from a <HI>per&s;onal kindne&s;s;</HI> he tells us that he lov'd the man, as well as honoured his memory; cele|brates the hone&s;ty, openne&s;s, and frankne&s;s of his temper; and only di&s;tingui&s;hes, as he rea&s;onably
<PB N="406" REF="411">
ought, between the real merit of the Author, and the &s;illy and derogatory applau&s;es of the Players. Ben John&s;on might indeed be &s;paring in his com|mendations, (tho' certainly he is not &s;o in this in|&s;tance) partly from his own nature, and partly from judgment. For men of judgment think they do any man more &s;ervice in prai&s;ing him ju&s;tly, than lavi&s;hly. I &s;ay, I would fain believe they were friends, tho' the violence and ill-breeding of their followers and flatterers were enough to give ri&s;e to the contrary report. I would hope that it may be with <HI>parties,</HI> both in wit and &s;tate, as with tho&s;e mon&s;ters de&s;cribed by the poets; and that their heads at lea&s;t may have &s;omething human, tho' their <HI>bodies</HI> and <HI>tails</HI> are wild bea&s;ts and &s;er|pents.</P>
<P>As I believe that what I have mentioned gave ri&s;e to the opinion of Shake&s;pear's want of learn|ing; &s;o what has continued it down to us may have been the many blunders and illiteracies of the fir&s;t publi&s;hers of his works. In the&s;e editions their ignorance &s;hines in almo&s;t every page; no|thing is more common than <HI>Actus tertia. Exit omnes. Enter three witches &s;olus.</HI> Their French is as bad as their Latin, both in con&s;truction and &s;pelling: Their very Wel&s;h is fal&s;e. Nothing is more likely than that tho&s;e palpable blunders of Hector's quoting Ari&s;totle, with others of that gro&s;s kind, &s;prung from the &s;ame root: it not be|ing at all credible that the&s;e could be the errors of
<PB N="407" REF="412">
any man who had the lea&s;t tincture of a &s;chool, or the lea&s;t conver&s;ation with &s;uch as had. Ben John&s;on (whom they will not think partial to him) allows him at lea&s;t to have had <HI>&s;ome</HI> Latin; which is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with mi&s;takes like the&s;e. Nay the con&s;tant blunders in proper names of per|&s;ons and places, are &s;uch as mu&s;t have proceeded from a man, who had not &s;o much as read any hi&s;tory, in any language: &s;o could not be Shake|&s;pear's.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now lay before the reader &s;ome of tho&s;e almo&s;t innumerable errors, which have ri&s;en from one &s;ource, the ignorance of the players, both as his actors, and as his editors. When the nature and kinds of the&s;e are enumerated and con&s;idered, I dare to &s;ay that not Shake&s;pear only, but Ari&s;totle or Cicero, had their works undergone the &s;ame fate, might have appeared to want &s;en&s;e as well as learning.</P>
<P>It is not certain that any one of his plays was publi&s;hed by him&s;elf. During the time of his em|ployment in the Theatre, &s;everal of his pieces were printed &s;eparately in quarto. What makes me think that mo&s;t of the&s;e were not publi&s;hed by him, is the exce&s;&s;ive carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s: every page is &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly fal&s;e &s;pelled, and almo&s;t all the learned or unu&s;ual words &s;o intolerably man|gled, that it's plain there either was no corrector to the pre&s;s at all, or one totally illiterate. If any were &s;upervi&s;ed by him&s;elf, I &s;hould fancy the two
<PB N="408" REF="413">
parts of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Mid&s;ummer-Night's Dream</HI> might have been &s;o: becau&s;e I find no other printed with any exactne&s;s; and (contrary to the re&s;t) there is very little variation in all the &s;ub|&s;equent editions of them. There are extant two prefaces, to the fir&s;t quarto edition of <HI>Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida</HI> in 1609, and to that of <HI>Othello;</HI> by which it appears, that the fir&s;t was publi&s;hed with|out his knowledge or con&s;ent, and even before it was acted, &s;o late as &s;even or eight years before he died; and that the latter was not printed till after his death. The whole number of genuine plays which we have been able to find printed in his life|time, amounts but to eleven. And of &s;ome of the&s;e, we meet with two or more editions by dif|ferent printers, each of which has whole heaps of tra&s;h different from the other: which I &s;hould fancy was occa&s;ioned by their being taken from different copies, belonging to different Play-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The folio edition (in which all the plays we now receive as his, were fir&s;t collected) was pub|li&s;hed by two Players, Heminges and Condell, in 1623, &s;even years after his decea&s;e. They de|clare, that all the other editions were &s;tolen and &s;urreptitious, and affirm theirs to be purged from the errors of the former. This is true as to the literal errors, and no other; for in all re&s;pects el&s;e it is far wor&s;e than the quarto's.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the additions of trifling and bom|ba&s;t pa&s;&s;ages are in this edition far more numerous.
<PB N="409" REF="414">
For whatever had been added, &s;ince tho&s;e quarto's by the actors, or had &s;tolen from their mouths in|to the written parts, were from thence conveyed into the printed text, and all &s;tand charged upon the Author. He him&s;elf complained of this u&s;age in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where he wi&s;hes that <HI>tho&s;e who play the Clowns would &s;peak no more than is &s;et down for them.</HI> (Act. iii. Sc. iv.) But as a proof that he could not e&s;cape it, in the old editions of <HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> there is no hint of a great number of the mean conceits and ribaldries now to be found there. In others, the low &s;cenes of Mobs, Plebeians and Clowns, are va&s;tly &s;horter than at pre&s;ent: And I have &s;een one in particular (which &s;eems to have belonged to the play-hou&s;e, by having the parts divided with lines, and the Actors names in the margin) where &s;everal of tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages were added in a written hand, which are &s;ince to be found in the folio.</P>
<P>In the next place, a number of beautiful pa&s;|&s;ages which are extant in the fir&s;t &s;ingle editions, are omitted in this: as it &s;eems without any other rea&s;on, than their willingne&s;s to &s;horten &s;ome &s;cenes: The&s;e men (as it was &s;aid of Procru&s;tes) either lopping, or &s;tretching an Author, to make him ju&s;t fit for their &s;tage.</P>
<P>This edition is &s;aid to be printed from the <HI>origi|nal copies.</HI> I believe they meant tho&s;e which had lain ever &s;ince the author's days in the play-hou&s;e, and had from time to time been cut, or added to,

<P>The Plays not having been before &s;o much as di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>acts</HI> and <HI>&s;cenes,</HI> they are in this edition divided according as they played them; of|ten where there is no pau&s;e in the action, or where they thought fit to make a breach in it, for the &s;ake of mu&s;ick, ma&s;ques, or mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;cenes are tran&s;po&s;ed and &s;huffled backward and forward; a thing which could no otherwi&s;e happen, but by their being taken from &s;eparate and piece-meal written parts.</P>

<P>From liberties of this kind, many &s;peeches al&s;o were put into the mouths of wrong per&s;ons, where the Author now &s;eems chargeable with making them &s;peak out of character: Or &s;ometimes per|haps for no better rea&s;on, than that a governing player, to have the mouthing of &s;ome favourite &s;peech him&s;elf, would &s;natch it from the unwor|thy lips of an underling.</P>
<P>Pro&s;e from ver&s;e they did not know, and they accordingly printed one for the other throughout the volume.</P>
<P>Having been forced to &s;ay &s;o much of the play|ers, I think I ought in ju&s;tice to remark, that the judgment, as well as condition, of that cla&s;s of people was then far inferior to what it is in our days. As then the be&s;t playhou&s;es were inns and tavern$ (the Globe, the Hope, the Red Bull, the Fortune&punc; etc.) &s;o the top of the profe&s;&s;ion were then meer players, not gentlemen of the &s;tage: They were led into the buttery by the &s;teward, not placed at the lord's table, or lady's toilette: and con&s;equently
<PB N="412" REF="417">
were entirely deprived of tho&s;e advantages they now enjoy, in the familiar conver&s;ation of our nobility, and an intimacy (not to &s;ay dearne&s;s) with people of the fir&s;t condition.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, there can be no que&s;|tion but had Shake&s;pear publi&s;hed his works him|&s;elf (e&s;pecially in his latter time, and after his re|treat from the &s;tage) we &s;hould not only be cer|tain which are genuine; but &s;hould find in tho&s;e that are, the errors le&s;&s;ened by &s;ome thou&s;ands. If I may judge from all the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of his &s;tyle, and his manner of thinking and writ|ing, I make no doubt to declare that tho&s;e wretch|ed plays, <HI>Pericles, Locrine, Sir John Oldca&s;tle, York&s;hire Tragedy, Lord Cromwell, The Puri|tan,</HI> and <HI>London Prodigal,</HI> cannot be admitted as his. And I &s;hould conjecture of &s;ome of the others (particularly <HI>Love's Labour's Lo&s;t, The Winter's Tale,</HI> and <HI>Titus Andronicus)</HI> that only &s;ome characters, &s;ingle &s;cenes, or perhaps a few particular pa&s;&s;ages, were of his hand. It is very probable what occa&s;ioned &s;ome plays to be &s;uppo&s;ed Shake&s;pear's was only this; that they were pieces produced by unknown authors, or fitted up for the theatre while it was under his admini&s;tration: and no owner claiming them, they were adjudged to him, as they give &s;trays to the Lord of the manor: a mi&s;take which (one may al&s;o ob&s;erve) it was not for the intere&s;t of the hou&s;e to remove. Yet the players them&s;elves, Heminges and Condell, af|terwards
<PB N="413" REF="418">
did Shake&s;pear the ju&s;tice to reject tho&s;e eight plays in their edition; tho' they were then printed in his name, in every body's hands, and acted with &s;ome applau&s;e; (as we learn from what Ben John&s;on &s;ays of <HI>Pericles</HI> in his Ode on the <HI>New-Inn.)</HI> That <HI>Titus Andronicus</HI> is one of this cla&s;s I am the rather induced to believe, by finding the &s;ame Author openly expre&s;s his contempt of it in the <HI>Induction</HI> to <HI>Bartholomew-Fair,</HI> in the year 1614, when Shake&s;pear was yet living. And there is no better authority for the&s;e latter &s;ort, than for the former, which were equally publi&s;hed in his life-time.</P>
<P>If we give into this opinion, how many low and vicious parts and pa&s;&s;ages might no longer reflect upon this great genius, but appear unworthily charged upon him? And even in tho&s;e which are really his, how many faults may have been unju&s;t|ly laid to his account from arbitrary additions, ex|punctions, tran&s;po&s;itions of &s;cenes and lines, con|fu&s;ion of characters and per&s;ons, wrong application of &s;peeches, corruptions of innumerable pa&s;&s;ages by the ignorance, and wrong corrections of them again by the impertinence of his fir&s;t editors? From one or other of the&s;e con&s;iderations, I am verily per&s;uaded, that the greate&s;t and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t part of what are thought his errors would vani&s;h, and leave his character in a light very different from that di&s;advantageous one, in which it now appears to us.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="419">
This is the &s;tate in which Shake&s;pear's writings lie at pre&s;ent; for, &s;ince the abovementioned folio edition, all the re&s;t have implicitly followed it, without having recour&s;e to any of the former, or ever making the compari&s;on between them. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repair the injuries already done him; too much time has elap&s;ed, and the mate|rials are too few. In what I have done I have rather given a proof of my willingne&s;s and de|&s;ire, than of my ability, to do him ju&s;tice. I have di&s;charged the dull duty of an Editor, to my be&s;t judgment, with more labour than I expect thanks, with a religious abhorrence of all innovation, and without any indulgence to my private &s;en&s;e or conjecture. The method taken in this edition will &s;hew it&s;elf. The various readings are fairly put in the margin, &s;o that every one may compare them; and tho&s;e I have prefer|ed into the text are con&s;tantly <HI>ex fide codicum,</HI> up|on authority. The alterations or additions which Shake&s;pear him&s;elf made, are taken notice of as they occur. Some &s;u&s;pected pa&s;&s;ages which are exce&s;&s;ively bad (and which &s;eem interpolations by being &s;o in&s;erted that one can intirely omit them without any cha&s;m, or deficience in the con|text) are degraded to the bottom of the page; with an a&s;teri&s;k referring to the places of their in&s;ertion. The &s;cenes are marked &s;o di&s;tinctly that every re|moval of place is &s;pecify'd; which is more nece&s;|&s;ary in this Author than any other, &s;ince he &s;hifts

them more frequently: and &s;ometimes without attending to this particular, the reader would have met with ob&s;curities. The more ob&s;olete or un|u&s;ual words are explained. Some of the mo&s;t &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages are di&s;tingui&s;hed by comma's in the margin: and where the beauty lay not in par|ticulars but in the whole, a &s;tar is prefixed to the &s;cene. This &s;eems to me a &s;horter and le&s;s o&s;ten|tatious method of performing the better half of Critici&s;m (namely the pointing out an Author's excellencies) than to fill a whole paper with cita|tions of fine pa&s;&s;ages, with <HI>general applau&s;es,</HI> or <HI>empty exclamations</HI> at the tail of them. There is al&s;o &s;ubjoined a catalogue of tho&s;e fir&s;t editions by which the greater part of the various readings and of the corrected pa&s;&s;ages are authori&s;ed (mo&s;t of which are &s;uch as carry their own evidence along with them.) The&s;e editions now hold the place of originals, and are the only materials left to re|pair the deficiencies or re&s;tore the corrupted &s;en&s;e of the Author: I can only wi&s;h that a greater num|ber of them (if a greater were ever publi&s;hed) may yet be found, by a &s;earch more &s;ucce&s;sful than mine, for the better accompli&s;hment of this end.</P>
<P>I will conclude by &s;aying of Shake&s;pear, that with all his faults, and with all the irregularity of his <HI>drama,</HI> one may look upon his works, in com|pari&s;on of tho&s;e that are more fini&s;hed and regular, as upon an ancient maje&s;tick piece of Gothic ar|chitecture, compared with a neat modern build|ing:

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The style of this Chapter in the Original Memoirs is so singularly different from the rest, that it is hard to con|ceive by whom it was penn'd. But if we consider the particular Regard which our Phylosopher had for it, who expre&s;sly direct|ed that not one Word of this Chapter should be alter'd it will be natural to suspect that it was written by himself, at the time when Love (ever delighting in Romances) had some what tinctur'd his &s;tyle; and that the Remains of his first and strongest Pa&s;sion gave him a Partiality to this Memorial of it. Thus it begins.</P>
<P>But now the succe&s;sful Course of the &s;tudies of Martin was interrupted by Love: Love, that unnerves the Vigour of the Here, and softens the Severity of the Phylo&s;opher.

While, Martin steed in a meditating Pes$ur$, feasting his Eyes on this Picture, he heard on a sudden the senerous Notes of a Clarien, which seem'd of the purest Crystal: in an Instant the pa&s;sing multitude fleck'd to the Sound, as when a Drum summons the straggling Soldiers to the appreaching Battle.

What wonder then, if his gentle Spirit, already humani$'d by a polite Education to receive all soft impre&s;sions, and fired by the sight of those beauties so lavishly expos'd to his view, should prove unable to resist at once so pleasing a Pa&s;sion, and so amiable a Phaenom$non?</P>
<P>Martin, who felt the true emotions of Love, blush'd that the object of his flame should be so openly prestituted to rulgar Eyes. And though he had been permitted to peruse her most secret Charms, yet his honourable Pa&s;sion was so strong, that it ran into the extreme of

<P>Eye Spirits of antiquity, who yet live in those sacred leaves! why do I make you conscious of my Shame?

This was the first day that he amused himself with the gaudy ornaments of the Body; that with secret pleasure he contemplated his Face, and the Symmetry of his Limbs in a Looking-gla&s;s.

Therefore Martin at this early hour was neither saluted by the sound of the Trumpet, nor were his Eyes feasted as before with the pleasing picture of his Mis|tre&s;s; but he walk'd to and fro before the door with folded arms, from the hour of five to eleven, hum|ming in a l$w and melancholy tune.</P>
<P>The Trumpet n$ sooner sounded, but his heart $word$ for joy, and a second S$$pence gain'd him a second admittance into her apartment.

<P>In the mean time it was no small cause of Wonder to M^&punc;Randal, that this Gentleman should come every day to behold the same show. He, no le&s;s covetous than the Guardian of a rich Heire&s;s, entertain'd a suspicion

that Martin had a design of stealing the Ladies. He thereupon i&s;sued out strict orders, not to admit our Lover on any pretence whatsoever&punc; what torments must this occasion in the raging Fever of Love?

<P>The $warfenter'd as he was reading the Letter, and, perceiving his Master mor'd by Pa&s;sion, immediately fellon his knees and confe&s;s'd the whole affair. M. Randal, benton Revenge, caused him to hasten to Martin's house, with a&s;surances that Lindamira had read his Letter with infinite satisfaction, and conjured him that he would immediately favour her escape. Martin over-joy'd at the news, fl$w $hither on the Wings of Love. The perfidious D$ar$ conducted him up Stairs in the dark, gently open'd the door, and bad him enter. How happy was Martin in that instant, who thought of nothing but leaping into the four soft arms of his Mi&s;tre&s;s! when $o, on a sudden he saw at the farther end of the room two glittring balls of Fire, which roll'd to and fro in a most terrible manner&punc; immediately his cars were invaded with horrid hi&s;sings and spittings, the balls of fire drew nearer him, and the redoubled as he approach'd. Our Philosopher, bold and resolute with Love, ventur'd towards it; when all at
<PB N="431" REF="438">
once he perceiv'd something grasp him hard by the threat, and fix as it were sharp lancels in his Ch$$k, so that bleed brickled a main down his Chin. Thrice Martin e&s;say'd to free himself, but rain were all his endeavours: $ill at length to sare his Life, he was forc'd to betray his Untrigue, and alarm the house with rei$$rated cries of murder. The apartment of the Bohemian Beauties being the adjoining Room, they more the first that enter'd with a light to his A&s;sistance. Martin all bleedy as he was, a most fierce $at-a mountain hanging at his Chin $which M. Randal had maliciously plac'd there on purpose) at the sight of Lindamira forget his distre&s;s. Ah, my love! (he cried) how like is thy fate to that of $his$$! who staying but a moment too late, found, as &s;he thought, her miserable Lover tern in pices by a savage beast! The affrighted $amsels $word$ alead; M. Randal with all his $word$ rush'd into the room; and new every hand conspired to free his under-Jaw from the Sharp $$eth of the $$raged Monster. But the Lady, whose heart melt$d at the pi$ecus Spectacle, was so zealous in this office of hu|manity, that the Cat-a-mountain, pr$vok'd at her good|natur'd diligence, leap'd &s;uriously on her, and mounted three of her Hands and her two Noses, to such a barba|reas
<PB N="432" REF="439">
degree, that she was not fit to be shown publickly for the sp$$$ of three Weeks. The generous $$$$r, men wounded at this Spectacle than by all the scratches he had himself re$$i$'d, charg'd the monster again wish the utmost intripidity, and rescued his mangled Mistre&s;s. Then (having taken her by the &s;tand, and given it a gentle grasp) he retreated with his eyes fixed upon her&punc; and just as he left the room (in a l$$ and tender $word$) thus breath'd forth his Soul: "Behold, all this have I "suffer'd for you".</P>
<P>Such, and $word$ medist was the first declaration of $$re, made on this eminent occasion by our Youthful Phi|losepher. Nor was it ungently received by the simple and innocent $indamira; who, hitherto unus'd to the soft. Pretistations $fadering Slaves, had rather been won der'd at than belov'd and receiv'd but imperfect nations of that tender language, from the Addre&s;ses only of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</P>
<P>Martin, notwithstanding this unfortunate adventure, still pursu'd his wishes. His $$tters were now no more intercepted. Lindamira read them, and behav'd like other courteous dames when they receive those am$rous Testimonials; conceal'd them from her Guardian, and
<PB N="433" REF="440">
return'd the most engaging answers. In short, she was so far captivated as to resolve no longer to be gaz'd at like a public Beauty in her own. A&s;sembly; but retire from the World, and become the $word$ Mistre&s;s of a $$$nily.</P>
<P>But fate had so ordain'd, that Martin was not more enamour'd on Lindamira, than Indamera was on Martin. She, jealous that her Sister had the great|est share in this conquest, resented that an equal application had not been made to herself she $word$ Lindamira to such a degree on this Subject, as made her promise to see Martin no more. But then again might Indamera be deem'd the unhappiest of Women, whom her Pa&s;sion and Imprudence had robb'd of the sight of her $word$ yet shame caused her to reneval these $harieties from her sister. And let the Reader judge here unhappy the $ymph must be, who waseven de|prived the universal Relief of a Selilequy. However, thus she thought, without bring allow'd to $word$ to any Greve or purling Stream.</P>
<P>Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira must never men $ee Martin, Martin shall never again ble&s;s the Eyes of Indamera. Yet why d$ $ay wretched, since my Rival
<PB N="434" REF="441">
can n$$$r $word$ my Lover without me? The pan$$ that others $$$in Abs$nce, from the thought of these $$ys that ble&s;s their Rirals, can never $$ing thy $word$ nor can they m$rtify $word$ by making thee a Witne&s;s, without giving thee at the same time a share of their Endearments. Change then thy pr$ceeding, Indamera; thy Jealousy must act a n$w and unheard of part, an$ promote the interest of thy Rival, as the only may to the enjoyment of thy Lover.</P>
<P>From that moment she studied by all methods to ad|vance her Sister's Amour, and in that her own. And thus there appear'd in these three Lovers as extraordinary a Conjunction of Pa&s;sions as of Persons: Love had r$con|eil'd himself to his mortal f$$, to Philosophy in Mar|tin, and to jealousy in Indamera.</P>
<P>And new flourish'd the $mour of Martin; succe&s;s $word$ p$$vented his wishes, the Marriage was agreed on, and the day appointed. Sunday was the time, when $Randal's absence farour'd their hopes, $h$ $word$ on that day omitted taking the fresh air in the Fields: the $ey of the door he always look with him.

Ladder was thrown up, and the signal given at the Window Lindamira hasten'd to the alarm of Love, when behold a new disaster! as she was g$tting out of the Win|dow, the weight of her Body on one side, and that of In|damera's on the other, unluckily caus'd them to stick in the midway: Lindamira hung with her coats stript up to the navel without, and Indamera in no le&s;s posture within. The Manteger, who for his gentlene&s;s was allowed to walk at large in the house, was so heighten'd of this sight, that he rush'd upon Indamera like a barbarous Ravisher. Indamera cried aloud for help.</P>
<P>Martin $word$ to revenge this insolent attempt of a R$pe $n his Wedding-day. The $ustful Menster, driven from our double $word$ $led into the middle of the room, pursu'd by the ralereus and indignant Martin Three times the het Mant$$$$, frighted at the furious menaces of his antagenist, made a circle round the chamber, and three times the swift-feeted Martin pursu'd him.

low: the herny Lance just ras'd his left Shoulder, and stuck into the tapestry hangings. Provok'd at this, the grin|ning offspring of Hanniman caught up the pointed $er$ of an $ntelope, and aim'd a blow against his undismay Adversary. Our heroic Lover, who held his hat before him like a shield, receiv'd the weapon full on the crown; it pierc'd the beaver, and gave a small rent to his breeches. Then the human &s;lung with mighty violence the hinder feet of an Elk, which hit the bestial combatant full on the nether Jaw. He reel'd, but soon recovering, and his skill in War lying rather in the close fight then in projectile weapons, he endeavour'd to close with him: forth with a&s;sailing him behind unawares, he clamber'd up his back, and pluck'd up by the roots a mighty grasp of hair|but Martin soon dismounted him, and kept him at a distance. Love not only inspired his breast with Courage, but gave double strength to his sine$s; he hear'd up the han$ of a prodigious Sea-monster; which when the chalt'ring Champion behold, he no le&s;s furious, wielded the Pendious Thigh-bone of a Giant. And now they stood oppos'd to each other, like the dread Explain of the seven-fold shield and the redoubted hector. The Thigh-bone mi&s;s'd its aim; but the hand of the Sea-monster deseended directly

Martin&punc; So he instantly went to counsel to adrise upon all po&s;sible methods of Revenge.</P>
<P>The first point he preceed$$ on was the Property of his Monster, and the question prepeunded was <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">An Sewi po$sin$, in vitis Dominis, Matrimonium contrahere?</NOTE><Q>&startq;Whether Slaves could marry without the consent of their Master?&endq;</Q> To this he was answer'd in the Affirmative, but told at the same time <Q>&startq;That <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">An Se$us Matrimonio $$imit$$ a Demini obsequie?</NOTE>the Marriage did not exempt them from Servitude.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This put him in no small h$pi$ of having Martin added to his &s;how, and acquiring a property in his Bedily i&s;sue
<PB N="439" REF="446" MS="Y">
by the Ladies. But his joy was seen dasn'd, when he was in|form'd that since Martin was a free man, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">An Liberi seq$untur Conditionem Patris, an Matris</NOTE><Q>&startq;The Chil|dren must follow the $n$ition of the $ather: or, that in died, if they were $o follow that of their Mother, the Case would be the same, there being no Slavery in England.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Then his Counsel judged it more advisable to plead for a $i&s;solution of the Marriage, upon the impo&s;sibility of Conjugal du$s in the $ife. But then the $anen Law al|low'd a Jriennial $ehabitation; which intirely ruin'd this project also. Besides it was evident by the same. Law, that "Monstrosity could not incapacitate from Marriage," witne&s;s the Case of Hermaphrodites, who are allow'd "facultation Conjug&uuml;, provided they make Election be|fore the Parish Priest, in what for they will act, and take an $a$$ never to perform in the other Capacity." <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sanchez, Hostiens.

<PB N="440" REF="447" MS="Y">
But then again they consider'd, that Martin might an|swer, he claim'd nothing but his own; and if another per|son had fix'd herself to his Wife, he must not for that cause be debarr'd the use of his Property.</P>
<P>Yet still, upon the same head of Martins po&s;se&s;sing his o$$use, a Suit might be derised in the name of Lindamira, on this account; <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">$$x or non tenetur vivere cum vi$e Concubinam tenente</NOTE>That a "Wife was not obliged to live with a $oncubine, and such her Sister Indamora must be accounted to Martin from the common <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">$ac$$s, ampplxus, cohabitalie</NOTE>proofs." So this too it was replied, that the Lawerder'd the Wife to r$side with the Husband if there were sufficient security given to ex|pell the concubine. So Martin might say he was ready to accomplish his part of the covenant, if his Wife would per|form hers, and consent to the <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">An $word$ tender Incisionem pali? Sanchez de Matrimonio</NOTE>Incision. But this being an impo&s;sibility on the side of the Wife, it cou'd no way exacted of the Husband.</P>
<P>It length $word$ Randal, bring vax'd to the Heart, to have been so long and so quaintly disappointed, determin'd to commence a Suit against martin for Bigamy and
<PB N="441" REF="448" MS="Y">
Incest. Mean while he left n$ Artifice or Addre&s;s un try'd to p$rplux the unhappy Phylosopher: He even centriv'd with infinite cunning, to alienate Indameras affections from him, and deba$ch'd her into an intrique with a creature of his even, the black Prince; whom he secretly cau|sed to marry her, while her Sister was asl$e$$.</P>
<P>Wereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn Plaintiff, and commenc'd a Suit in the Spiritual Court against the black Prince, for Cohabitation with his said Wife. He was advis'd to insist upon a n$w point, (viz.) <Q>&startq;That Lindamira and Indamora together made up but one lawful Wife.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Monster-master, further to distre&s;s Martin, forc'd Sin|damira to petition for $$ment, $word$ pendente: which was no sooner allow'd her by the Court, but he obliged her to alledge, that, <Q>&startq;it was not sufficient to maintain both her|self and her Sister; and if her Sister perish'd, she could not live with the dead Body about her.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Martin now began to repent that he not executed a resolution he formerly conceiv'd, of marrying $word$ to Indamora, as an Expedient to have made all secure. Moreover, it was insisted on; that the other also had a right to Miment, <Q>&startq;because, if Martins Wife should prove with, the said Sister must

nece$sarily perform the offices of a Wife, in contributing to the Sutrition and Gastalien of the said child.&endq;</Q>. A Jury of Phy|sicians being impannel'd, declar'd, that as to. Sutrition they were doubtful, whether any bleed of Lindamira circula$$e through Indmera: But as to Gastalien, it was criden$$y true. And upon this, Martin was order'd to allow $lliment to both, the black Prince appearing inse$vent.</P>
<P>Then the Court proceeded to the Trial. And as both the Cause and the pleadings ar$ of an extraordinary. Nature, me think fit here to insert them at length.</P>
<P>D^r. Penny-feather thus pleaded for. Martinus Scrib$erus the Plaintiff.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>D^r. Penny-feather.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I appear before your Honour in behalf of Martinus Scri|blerus, Batchelor of Physick, in a Complaint against Ebn-Hai-Paw-W$w, commonly call'd the black Prince of Mene|m$tapa; Inasmuch as the said Ebn-Hai-Paw-W$w, hath maliciously, forcibly, and unlawly seiz'd ravish'd, and detain'd Lindamira-Indamora, the Wife of the said. Martin, and the Body of the said Lindamira-Indamora from time to time ever since, hath wickedly, l$wdly, and
<PB N="443" REF="450">
indecently us'd, handled, and $rib entreated. And in or|der to make this his $ill any more lasting, hath presum'd to marry this our Wife, pretending to give his wickedne&s;s the Sanction of a Saw. And forasmuch as the adulterer&punc; doth not d$ny the fact, but insists upon his said marriage as lawful, we cannot open the Case more plainly to your Honour, than by answering his Reasons, which, indeed to mention, is to cenful$.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;He maintains nole&s;s an absurdity than this, that One is Two; and that Lindamira-Indamora, the indivi|dual wife of the Plaintiff, is not one, but two Persons: and that the said Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw is not married to Lin|damira, the Wife of the said. Martin, but to his own lawful Wife Indamora, another individual person distinct from the said Lindamira, the join'd to her by a strong Ligament of Nature.</Q></P>
<P>In answer whereunto we shall prove three things: <Q>&startq;&endq;First, that the said Lindamira-Indamora, now our lawful Wife makes but one individual Person.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Secondly, That if they made two individual Persons, yet they constitute but one Wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Thirdly, That supposing they made two individual Per|sons,
<PB N="444" REF="451" MS="Y">
and $word$ Hives each lawfully marry'd to her own $word$ band, yet Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-$$$$ hath no right to detain Lindamira our lawful wedded wife, on pretence of being married to Indamora.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;As to the first point: It will be nece&s;sary to determine the constituent Principle and E$$$nce of Individuality, which, in respect to mankind, we take to be one &s;imple identical $$ul in one simple Identical Body. The individuality, samene&s;s or identity of the body, is not determin'd (as some vainly imagine) by one head, and a certain number of arms, legs, and other mem|bers; but in one simple <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or member of Generation&punc; Let us search profane History, and we shall find Geryon with three heads, and Briar$$s with an Hundred hands. Let us search sacred History, and we meet with one of the Sons of the Giants with &s;ix Fingers to each hand, and six $$$s to each Foot; yet none ever accounted Ge|ryon or Briar$us more than one Person: and give us leave to say, the wife of the said Geryon would have had a good action against any women who should have espous'd themselves to the other two heads of that Monarch. The Reason is plain; because each of these having but
<PB N="445" REF="452" MS="Y">
one simple <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or one Member of Generation, could be look'd upon as but one single Person.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;In conformity to this, when we behold this one Member, we distinguish the Sex, and pronounce it a Man, or a Woman; or as the $alins expre&s;s it, $word$ and $word$ an Homme, $word$ F$mme; one Man, one Woman. For the same Reason. Man and Wife are said to be one Fle$$$ because united in that part which constitutes the samene&s;s and individuality of each Sex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And as there is but one Member of Generation, there is but one Body, so there can be but one Soul; because the said&punc; Organ of Generation is the Seat of the Soul; and conse|quently, where there is but one such Organ, there can be but one Soul. Set me here say, without injury to truth, that no Phylosopher, either of the past or present age, hath taken more pains to discover where the Soul keeps her residence, than the Plaintiff, the learned Martinus S$ribl$rus: And after his most diligent enquiries and experiments, he hath been verily p$rs$aded, that the Organ of Generation is the true and only Seal of the Soul. That this part is seated in the middle, and near the Centre of the whole Body, is obvious to your Honour's
<PB N="446" REF="453">
view. From thence, like the Sun in the Centre of the World, the $eal dispenses her warmth and vital influenc$&punc; $$t the Brain glory in the Wisdom of the aged, the Science of the learned, the policy of the Statesman, and the In|$ention of the witty; the accidental Amusements and $word$ of the Soul, and mortal as the $word$ of them&punc; It is to the $r$an$ of Generation that we awe man himself&punc; there the Soul is employ'd in works Suitable to the dignity of her nature, and (as we may $word$ oils breeding over ages yet unborn.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;We need not tell your Honour, that it has been the opini|on of many most learned $irines and Phylosephers, that the S$ul, as well as Body, is produced $word$ traduc$. This d$ct$ine has been defended by arguments irrefraga$$, and accounts for difficulties, without it, inexplicable. All which arguments conclude with equall strength, for the Soul's being seated in the organs of Generation. For since the whole Man, both Soul and Body, is there form'd, and since nothing can operate but where it is, it follows, that the Soul must reside in that individual place, where She exerts her generatir$ and plastic pow|ers.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="454">
<Q>&startq;&endq;This our doctrine is confirm'd by all these Experiments, which conspire to prove the absolute dominion which that part hath over the whole Body. We see how ma|ny women, who are deaf to the persuasions of the Elo|quent, the insinuations of the Crafty, and the threats of the imperious, are easily governed by some poor $word$ unfurnish'd with the least art, but that of making immediate application to this Seat of the Soul. The impre&s;sions made by the Ear are so distant, and transmitted thro' so many windings, that they lose their Energy: But your honour, by immediately applying to the organ of generation, gets like a bold and wise Petitioner, who goes strait to the very throne and Judgment-Seal of the Monarch. And whereas it is objected that here are two Wills, and therefore $word$ different persons; we answer, if multi|plicity of Wills implied multiplicity of Persons, there are few Husbands but what are guilty of Polygamy, there being in the same woman great and notorious diversi|ty of Wills: A point which we shall not need to insist upon before any married person, much le&s;s of your Honour's Experience.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="455">
<Q>&startq;&endq;Thus we have made $eed our first and principal point; That if the Wife of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamora, hath but one Organ of Generation, she is but one individual Person, in the truest and most proper Sense of Individuality. And that the matter of Sad is so, we are willing to put up on a fair Trial by a $ury of $atrons, whom year Honour shall think fit to nominate and appoint, to inspect the Body of the said Lindamira-Indamora.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Secondly, We are to prove, that tho' Lindamira-Indamora were two individual Persons, consisting each of a Soul and Body, yet, if they have but one Organ of Generation, they can constitute but one Wi$e. $or, from whence can the Unity of any thing be denominated, but from that which constitutes the E&s;sence or principal use of it? Thus, if a knife or hatche$ have but one blade, though two handles, it will properly be denominated but one knife, $word$ hatche$; in as much as it hath but one of that which constitutes the E&s;sence or principal Use of a knife or hatche$. So if there were not only one, but twenty Supposita Rationalia with one common Organ of Generation, that one System would only make
<PB N="449" REF="456">
one Wife. Upon the whole, let not a few heads, legs, or arms extraordinary, bia$s your Honour's Judgment, and de|prive the Plaintiff of his legal property: In which right our Client is so strongly fortified, that allowing both the former Prepositions to be false, and that there were two persons, two Bodies, two Rational Souls, yea, and two Organs of Generation, yet would it still be plain in the third place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That the Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Pa$-Wa$, can have no Right to detain from the Plaintiff his lawfully wedded Wife, Lindamira. For, abstracting from the priority of the marriage of our Client, by which it would seem he acquired a property in his Wife and all other matter inseparably anner'd unto her, it is evident Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, by his Marriage to Indamora, could never acquire any property in Lindamira; nor can produce any Cause why both of them should live with himself, rather than with the other? Therefore, we humbly hope your Honour will order the Body of our said Wife to be restored to us, and due Censure past on the said Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="457">
$word$ Pennyfeather having thus ended his $l$ading was thus answer'd by</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Dr $$atherhead.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I will not trouble your Honour with any unnece$sary Preamble, or false $$lours of Elequence, which truth $word$ no need of, and which would prove too thin a $word$ for Falshood before the penetrating Eyes of your Honour. In answer therefore to what our learned brother, Dr. Pennyfeather, hath a$serted, we shall labour to demonstrate,</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;First, That though there were but one Organ of Generation, yet are there two distinct persons. Secondly, That, although there were but one Organ of Generation, so far would it be from giving the Plaintiff any right to the Body of Indamora, the Wife of Ebn-$ai-Pa$-W$$, that it will subject the Plaintiff to the Penalty of $n$$st, or of Bigamy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Thirdly, We doubt not to prove that the said Lin|damira-Indamora hath two distinct parts of Generation. And, first we will show, that neither the individual $$sence of Mankind, nor the seat of the Soul, doth re|side in the Organ of Generation; and this first
<PB N="451" REF="458" MS="Y">
from Reason. For unreasonable indeed must it be, to make that the Seat of the rational Soul, which alone sets us on a level with beasts; or to conceive, that the E$sence of unity and individuality should consist in that which is the source of Discord and Division. In a word, what can be greater absurdity, than to affirm $$stiality to be the E&s;sence of Humanity, Darkne&s;s the Centre of Light, and $il$hine&s;s the Seat of Purity? We could, from the authority of the most eminent Phi|losophers of allages, confirm this our A&s;sertion: few of whom ever had the Impudence to degrade this $$een, the rational Soul, to the very lowest and $ilest apartment, or rather Sink of her whole Palace. But we shall produce still a greater Authority than these, to manifest that personal Individuality did subsist, when there was no such generative Carnality.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;It hath been strenuously maintain'd by many ho|ly Divines and particularly by Thomas Aquinas that our first Parents, in the state of Innocence, did in no wise propagate their Species after the present common manner of men and beasts; but that the pro|pagation at that time must have been by Intuition,
<PB N="452" REF="459">
$word$ of Ideas, or some pure and spiritual manner, suitable to the dignity of their Station. And the $word$ were distinguish'd in that State, yet it is plain it was not by parts, such as we have at present; since if our first Parents had any such, they must have known it; and it is written, that they discover'd them $et till after the Fall; when it is probable those parts were the immediate Exere$cence of Sin, and only grow forth to render them fitter companions for those beasts among which they were driven.</Q></P>
<P>It is a maxim in Phylosophy, that generatio $$ius $st $word$ $$erius; whence it is apparent that the Pa|ra disaical Generation was of a different nature from ours, free from all corruption and Tr$becillity, This is farther $erreb$rated by the authority of those Doctors of the Church who have a&s;serted, that before the Fall, Adam was $ndew'd with a continual uninterrupted Faculty of Generation, which can be explain'd of $e other than of that Intuitire Ge|neration abovesaid: Since it is well known to all, the least skill'd in Anatomy, that the present (male) part of Generation is utterly incapable
<PB N="453" REF="460">
of this continual Faculty.</P>
<Q>&startq;&endq;We come new to our second point, wherein the ad|vocate for the plaintiff a $word$ that if there were two persons, and one Organ of Generation, this Sys|tem would constitute but one Wife. This will put the Plaintiff still in a worse Condition, and render him plainly guilty of Bigamy, Rap$, or Incest. For if there be but one such Organ of Generation then both the persons of Lindami$a and Indamera have an equal property in it, and what is Indamera's properly cannot be dispos'd of without her consent. We therefore bring the whole to this short I&s;sue; whether the Plaintiff. Martinus Scriblerus had the consent of Indamera, or not&punc; If he hath had her consent, he is guilty of Bigamy; if not, he is guilty of a Rape, or Incest, or both.</Q>
<Q>&startq;&endq;The Dependant, Prince $$n-Hai-$aw-Waw, having been lately baptiz'd; hath with singular medisty abstain'd from consummation with his said Wife, untill he shall be satisfied from the opinion of your Honour, his learned Judge, how far in Law and Conscience he may proceed; and therefore he&punc;
<PB N="454" REF="461">
cannot affirm much, nor positively, as to the structure of the Organ of Generation of this his Wife Indamera. Yet make we no doubt, that it will upon inspection appear, that the said Organ is distinct from that of $in|damira: whereupon we $word$ to hear the report of the jury of. $atrons&punc; appointed to inspect the Body of the said Gentlewoman.</Q>
<Q>&startq;&endq;And if the matter of $span$ give me your Honour's permi&s;sion to repeat what hath been said by the advo|cate for the Plaintiff; to wit, that Martinus Scriblerus, Batchelor in Physick, by this his Marriage with Linda|mira, could in no wise acquire any property in the Body of $ndamera, nor shew any Cause why this duplicated Wife Lindamira-Indamera, should abide with him, rather than with the Dependant, Prince E$n-Hai-$aw-$aw of $word$.</Q>
<P>The Jury of Matrons having made their Report, and it appearing from thence that the parts of Generation in Lindamira and Indamera were distinct, the Judge $word$ time to deliberate, and the next Court-day he spoke to this effect.</P>

<HEAD>Gentleman</HEAD>
<Q>&startq;&endq;I am of opinion that Lindamira and Indamera $word$ distinct persons, and that both the Marriages are $word$ and ralid: therefor$ I order you, Martinus Scri|blerus, Batchelor in Physic, and you, Ebn-Hai Pam Wa$, Prince of Menem$tapa, to $word$ with your $word$ and to be in bed each on the side of his own Wife. I hope, Gentlemen, you will seriously consider, that you are under a $word$ T$e than common Brothers in law; that being, as it more, joint Pro&s;prieters of one common $word$ you will so behave as good fellow ledgers ought to do, and $word$ great modesty each to his respec|tive Sister-in-law, abstaining from all farthar Family|critics than what $word$ Duties do naturally oblige you to. Consider also by hero small Limits the Duty and the $word$ is divided, $est, while ye discharge the duty of Matrimony, ye hardlesly slide into the sin of adultery</Q>
<P>This S$ntence pleas'd neither party; and Martin appeal'd from the Consistory to the $word$ Arches, but they confirm'd the Sentence of the $$nsistery.</P>
<P>It was at last brought before a Commi&s;sion of Delegates;
<PB N="456" REF="463">
who having weigh'd the Case, revers'd the Sentence of the inferior Courts, and disannull'd the marriage, upon the fellowing Reasons, <Q>&startq;That allowing the manner of $ehabitation enjoin'd to be practicable (though highly inconvenient) yet the $span$ being at all times equal in both Husbands and both Wives, and at the same time impo&s;sible in more than one; two persons could not have a right to the entire po&s;se&s;|sion of the same thing, at the same time; nor could one s$ enjoy his property, as to de$ar another from the use of his, who has an equal right. So much as to the $word$ p$$e$$i; and as to the $word$ $word$ $$m$ $word$ ad impo&s;sible.&endq;</Q> Therefore the Lords, with great Wis|dom, di&s;solv'd both Marriages, as proceeding upon a natural, as well as legal Absurdity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the S$$e&s;sion of Martinus and some Hint of his Travels</HEAD>
<P>This affair being thus unhappily terminated, and become the whole talk of the Town; Martinus, unable to support the Affection, as well as the many disagree|able Consequences, resolv'd to quit the Ringdom.</P>
<P>But we must not here neglect to mention, that du|ring the whole course of this proce&s;s, his c$ntinual Attendance on the Courts in his own Cause, and his invincible Curiosity for all that past in the Causes of others, gave him a Wonderful insight into this branch of Learning, which must be confe&s;s'd to have been so improved by the Moderns, as beyond all Comparison to exceed the ancients. From the day his first Bill was filed, he began to collect Reports; and before his Suit was ended, he had time abundantly sufficient to complite a very considerable Column. His anger
<PB N="458" REF="465" MS="Y">
at his ill succe&s;s caus'd him to destroy the greatest part of these Reports; and only to preserve such, as discover'd most of the $word$ and Fatility of the Practice. These we have some hopes to recover, if they were only mislaid at his Removal; if not, the world will be enough instructed to lament the le$s, by the only one new publick, viz, The $ase of Stradling and S$$les, in an action concerning certain black and white Horses,</P>
<P>We cannot wonder that he contracted a violent $ver|sion to the $aw, as is evident from a whole Chapter of his Travels. And perhaps his Disappointment gave him also a Dis-inelination to the Fair Sex, for whom on some occasions he does not expre&s;s all the Respect and admiration po&s;sible. This doubtless must be the Reason; that i$ no part of his we find him $$ee'd by any strange Prince&s;s; $er have we $he least account that he ever relaps'd into this Pa&s;|sion, except what is mentioned in the Introduction, of the Spanish' Lady's Phenomenon.</P>
