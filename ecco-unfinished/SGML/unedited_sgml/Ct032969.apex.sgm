<HEAD>SOME REMARKS On the Fir&s;t Chapter in Dr. <HI>DAVENANT</HI>'s ESSAYS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Concerning Appeals to the People from their Repre&s;entatives.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS one of the mo&s;t unhappy Methods can po&s;&s;ibly be taken by an Author, to have the Title of his Book tell the World one thing, and the Book it &s;elf another; for as it &s;a|vours of abundance of In&s;incerty in Principle, &s;o it &s;eems to bring &s;ome Scandal upon the very De&s;ign of the Book, as if it had occa&s;ion for a double A&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
I cannot think when I meet with &s;uch a Book, that I do the Author any wrong, by &s;uppo&s;ing that diffe|rent Colours are put upon the Face of the Work, be|cau&s;e for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, it is not fit to be &s;een in its Own.</P>
<P>Di&s;gui&s;es are never u&s;ed where nothing is to be con|cealed, and nothing is concealed, but what Shame, Fear, or Policy commands to be hid.</P>
<P>A Genuine Cau&s;e carrys its Narive Colours always outermo&s;t, is never &s;hy of its Face, nor fond of being concealed.</P>
<P>The application lies full again&s;t the E&s;&s;ays of a lear|ned Author lately Publi&s;hed and Dedicated to her Ma|je&s;ty, which I cannot but &s;ay, had been Genuine e|nough, had the Title and Dedication not given us a wrong Idea of the Work; had the Title been, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay again&s;t Peace at Home;</HI> the Author whether he had di&s;|covered his Mind or no, I wont determine; had cer|tainly made the Title and the Book corre&s;pond, the Doctrine had been &s;uitable to the Text, and the Work all of a Piece.</P>
<P>Neither can I reconcile the Dedication of it to the Subject, much le&s;s to the time 'twas wrote in, for whereas the Author owns the time, the Tracts here pointed at were wrote in, to be a time of Provocation, Di&s;gu&s;t, and ill Blood, and thinks there was good Rea&s;on for it too; the &s;uiting it to a time when her Maje&s;ty makes a healing Propo&s;al of Peace, makes a lit|tle more Incongruity than is u&s;ual to be &s;een in his more Polite Management of his Pen.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for I could ea&s;ily have abated this Gentleman the Ob&s;ervation of ill Timeing one Piece, and he might be allowed to be very capable of
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;uch Alterations as might heal the Breach of Time be|tween the Tract it &s;elf and the Queen's Speech.</P>
<P>But there &s;eems to me &s;uch a contrariety of Circum|&s;tances, in the very Sub&s;tantial E&s;&s;ential Part of her Maje&s;ties Speech, and that part of the Book which I have here taken in hand, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make a Symphony of &s;uch di&s;cording Parts.</P>
<P>This is to tell her Maje&s;ty, we joyn with her Propo|&s;al of Peace and Union, and will endeavour to pur&s;ue it by deve&s;tng all her Subjects as a collective Body of their Native Original Power and Property, and over|turning the very Center of the Monarchy.</P>
<P>How ea&s;y 'tis for Men of Wit to give any thing a fair Face, and by a happy turn of Language call things of contrary Subjects by the &s;ame Name; Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> depriving the People of all Power, but what is Repre|&s;entative and giving the Delegated Power a Superio|rity over the Power Delegating. Sir <HI>Humphrey Mack|worth</HI> defending an Occa&s;ional Bill, and both pre&s;ent|ed to the World with the Equi-Vocal Title of <HI>Peace at Home,</HI> and dedicated to the Queen with high Strains of Eloquence, of which both are very Good Ma&s;ters, complimenting her Maje&s;ty on the Head of Peace pro|po&s;ed in her Speech to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Certainly, Gentlemen, you mu&s;t both of you mi&s;|take her Maje&s;ties Meaning, who without doubt is act|ing in the &s;afe middle Way, between both your Ex|treams. If you are driving at <HI>Peace at Home,</HI> 'tis by &s;ome Antiperi&s;ta&s;is, &s;ome contraries in Nature, and con|&s;equently the End you aim at is remote, and the Means tedious: It may be a Way to Peace for ought we know, but certainly 'tis not that Peace her Maje&s;ty means, 'tis not the Peace the Nations want, and there|fore give me leave to make this ju&s;t Di&s;tinction be|tween
<PB N="4" REF="5">
her Maje&s;ties Propo&s;al, and your projected E&s;&s;ay, as to the Nature of Peace.</P>
<P>Your Peace is a Peace of Subjection, her Maje&s;ties is a Peace of Conjunction, and this her Maje&s;ty has mo&s;t explicitly directed us to under&s;tand by the immediate addition of a term Comprehen&s;ive of both; <HI>&V;uion</HI> you may be for Peace, but 'tis <HI>Peace and &V;niou</HI> that the&s;e Nations want, and which her Maje&s;ty recommends to all her Subjects to promote.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Head of the learned E&s;&s;ays lately publi&s;hed, and which I fix on in the&s;e Remarks, is concerning <HI>The Danger of appealing to the People from their Repre&s;en|tatives in Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Author &s;ays, P. 22.</HI> That &s;ome Doctrines have been &s;pread abroad in an open manner pretending, that in reference to the Publick, the People and their Repre&s;en|tatives may have di&s;tinct Rights.</P>
<P>That the People have not devolved their whole Power in Government upon their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>That Parliaments are accountable to, and to be con|trolled in all their Proceedings by the People.</P>
<P>That 'tis always Lawful, and often expedient to Appeal from the Hou&s;e of Commons to the People.</P>
<P>That the&s;e things have been printed, Arraigning the whole Proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Commons, calling their undoubted Priviledges in que&s;tion, and as it were appeal|ing to the Rabbe from all their Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed that the&s;e Quotations had been Mark'd with proper References to the re&s;pective Au|thors or Books, which have advanced the things al|ledg'd, that the Originals being examined, might be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;peak for them&s;elves, and tho' the omitting &s;uch References, admits of Objection and &s;ome Re|flection,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
yet I choo&s;e to omit all &s;uch Reflections as are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Ca&s;e in Hand, be|ing willing to treat my Author with all the Civility and Re&s;pect his Worth Demands, and the Ca&s;e will bear.</P>
<P>This premis'd, I take all he alledges for granted, as to quotation, and &s;hall only proceed to ex|amine not whether it be fairly proved by him, that &s;uch things are printed, but whether he has fair|ly confuted the thing it &s;elf, and proved what he al|ledges.</P>
<P>In order to this, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to examine what it is the Dr. offers in an&s;wer to the&s;e Tenents which he &s;ays have been &s;o openly &s;pread abroad.</P>
<P>That this appealing to the People is de&s;tructive to the Nature of the Con&s;titution, that 'tis practicing all the Methods of Sedition with which &s;he attacks a ju&s;t Authority; exciting the People to overthrow the Pri|viledges of their own Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the Author of this matter had been plea&s;ed to tell us what he calls Appeals to the People, and that he had di&s;tingui&s;h'd between the ju&s;t Right of the Peo|ple, and tho&s;e of the Repre&s;entatives, and between tho&s;e Authors who are for maintaining the due Cur|rency of Right in every part of it, and tho&s;e who are guilty, as he &s;ays, of giving Authority a Mortal Blow.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there are tho&s;e who do not believe that all Power is given to the Repre&s;entative, and none left with the repre&s;ented, and yet are not for over|throwing the Priviledges of their Repre&s;entatives; and of the&s;e I profe&s;s my &s;elf to be one.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
I wi&s;h the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in Parliament would be plea&s;ed to a&s;certain what was their nndoubted Right, and what not; that they would let us know how far their Power extends, with re&s;pect to the People they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Rights of the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> with re&s;pect to the Crown, and the &s;upreme Authority of their King; has been often di&s;cu&s;s'd, &s;ometimes with the Pen, and &s;ometimes with the Sword; and however &s;ome have affected a Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, the Repre&s;entatives of the Nation have always thought fit to a&s;&s;ume a Right to defend their Liberties, when they have found them invaded by Exorbitant Power.</P>
<P>But what the Right of the Commons in Parliament are, and how far they extend, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e from whom they come there, has never yet been a&s;cer|tained by Parliament.</P>
<P>Some <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Vind. of the Rights of the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> by Sir <HI>H. M.</HI></NOTE>E&s;&s;ays have been made this way from the Pre&s;s, and Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> gave us a Scheme of parliamenta|ry Power drawn to a higher Extreme than ever any Hou&s;e of Commons have thought fit to extend the Practice.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;equent Author thought fit to advance &s;ome contrary Notions, which however they are in general Exploded by both the&s;e Authors, have never yet met with anyfair Confutation.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way to an&s;wer an Author in &s;uch Ca&s;e is, by granting what they them&s;elves allow, and from the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of what they Grant prove the Ab&s;urdity of what they Deny.</P>
<P><HI>And to me, it &s;eems, this Author has laid him&s;elf o|pen in this very Ca&s;e, for in his Introduction, he al|lows, P. 14.</HI> That the Peoples Repre&s;entatives ought never
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to give up Fundamentals: Nor can they do it, becau&s;e as to Fundamentals, they are but the People's Tru&s;tees, and can do no Act that can bind their Principals to any thing that is to their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>This is Fuudamental Truth, and I &s;hould be exceed|ing glad to &s;ee it reconciled to what is a&s;&s;erted after|ward, in the Chapter of appealing to the People where 'tis affirmed, that to &s;ay, <HI>The People may have Di&s;tinct Right from their Repre&s;entatives, and that the People have not devolved their whole Power upon their Re|pre&s;entatives, is de&s;tructive to the Nature of the Con&s;tituti|on, P.</HI> 22, 23.</P>
<P>I am not very regular in the Method, but I am very certain of the Groundwork of my Argument, of which this is the Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>If the Repre&s;entatives of the People may do any thing which is not binding to their Principals <HI>the Peo|ple,</HI> then the People have a Right to contradict, and make void &s;omething their Repre&s;entatives may do, and con&s;equently have &s;ome Power which is not de|volved upon the Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>I conceive this Error might &s;lip our Author's Memo|ry, for want of laying down a proper Foundation for his Argument, and coming to a po&s;itive Determinati|on what we are to under&s;tand by Appeals to the Peo|ple, <HI>The Danger of Appeals to the People,</HI> is the Title to the Chapter, but we are no where in the Chapter told what the&s;e Appeals to the People are.</P>
<P>If he means, <HI>P.</HI> 26. <HI>The People being &s;tirred up to lop off a Branch of the Common-Wealth by trampling on the Rights and Priviledges of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI> I grant there is Danger in this; But how are the People thus to be &s;tirred up? as that learned Gentleman Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> in his
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Book, <HI>Of the Rights of the Commons in Parliament;</HI> Ob|&s;ervs, It cannot be that &s;o many worthy Gentlemen can act contrary to, or De&s;tructive of the Liberties of their Native Country.</P>
<P>So it cannot be that the People of <HI>England</HI> can ever De&s;ign to lop off this Branch, and trample on the Rights and Priviledges of their Repre&s;entatives; this would be to de&s;troy them&s;elves, and cut them&s;elves off from the principal Vital part of the Con&s;titution; an univer|&s;al Frenzy mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of Men whenever &s;uch a Thing is &s;uppo&s;ed to come to pa&s;s, the People mu&s;t be all Lunatick, and the Nation be a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> not a Civil Government.</P>
<P>And as we are &s;ecur'd by the very Nature of the Thing, from the Danger of the People of <HI>England;</HI> ever dethroning their Repre&s;entatives, &s;o there is no real Nece&s;&s;ity to prevent &s;nch an Imaginary Fear by the People dive&s;ting them&s;elves of their Original Right, and Ve&s;ting all Power in their Repre&s;en|tatives.</P>
<P>But &s;ince Demon&s;tration is the be&s;t way of Argument, and the Subject I am upon has great plenty of tho&s;e Helps; let us &s;ee if it is not an unpardonable Ab|&s;urdity, to &s;ay the People have no di&s;tinct Right which their Repre&s;entatives have not:</P>
<P>For Example,</P>
<P>The People have a Right when the King Di&s;&s;olves their Repre&s;entative to chu&s;e another, this Power their Repre&s;entative has not; this is a Right Di&s;tinct from their Repre&s;entative, a Power which was uever devolved upon them, and which I &s;uppo&s;e never will; If the People had no Power but what was devolv'd upon their Repre&s;entatives, then having once cho&s;en
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;uch a Repre&s;entative, that Body &s;hould upon every Di&s;&s;olution Nominate a Succe&s;&s;ion of Repre&s;enta|tives.</P>
<P>But whenever the Crown Di&s;&s;olves a Parliament, the People have the Power di&s;tinct from their Repre&s;enta|tions to choo&s;e anew, and if &s;o; then all the Power of the People is not devolved upon the Repre&s;enta|tives, but <HI>the&s;e</HI> have &s;ome right Di&s;tinct from <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ee any thing in this, which tends to Con|fu&s;ion, or which is any way de&s;tructive to the Con&s;ti|tution; Thus far I mu&s;t ask the Author's Pardon, for &s;aying, <HI>with all the Re&s;pect for him which the Ca&s;e will bear,</HI> that his Arguments run a little foul of one an|other.</P>
<P><HI>I come next to ob&s;erve, that which I think is not extraordinary ju&s;t in the way of Arguing; when Page, 27. he is plea&s;ed to allow,</HI> Kings may differ with Lords and Commons, and the Two Hou&s;es may differ among them|&s;elves, and yet the publick Peace not be di&s;turbed, the Peo|ple al&s;o may differ about Civil or Religious Matters, and have various Thoughts concerning Government, Parties may grow up, and mutual Heats ari&s;e, and yet the Com|mon Wealth remain unwounded in its Vitals. But Di&s;|cord is fatal, when a &s;trong Faction is form'd again&s;t any part of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>This &s;eems a little Equi-vocal, and it appears like|ly, that a Di&s;cord in the publick Members of the Con&s;titution may be as Fatal as the other; Heats in the Hou&s;es again&s;t one another, Factions in the Hou&s;es again&s;t their Prince or De&s;igns of Tyrany in the Prince again&s;t either or both Hou&s;es of Parliament, the&s;e are all certainly as dangerous things and as De&s;tru|ctive of the Con&s;titution as appeals to the People, and yet
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="10" REF="13">
&s;uch is the Force of Rethorick, as to put a &s;haddow of indifference on the&s;e and charge all the Fatallity on the Peoples falling out with their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s if any Man &s;hould ask me, which of tho&s;e things before mention'd are of wor&s;t Con&s;equence to the Nations Peace, I &s;hould find it difficult to tell him, but &s;ure every one &s;eperately or Conjunctively is as bad as a difference between the People and their Repre|&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Then let us go on to Examine the Parralel, as in the differences mentioned above, the Peace may remain Unbroken, and the Common Wealth Unwounded in its Vitals; &s;o may it in this Ca&s;e, the People may be generally dis&s;atisfied with their Repre&s;entatives, they may be very Unea&s;y and make loud Complaints, but it does not follow that they mu&s;t immediately ri&s;e in Tumults, and pull the Hou&s;e about their Ears.</P>
<P>We have &s;een a time when a certain H&mdash;&s;e be|hav'd &s;o, that the general Cry of the People was to de|&s;olve them, and Multitudes of Addre&s;&s;es did in as plain Language as decency to the Crown would ad|mit of pre&s;ent the Peoples de&s;ire to have them di&s;|&s;olv'd: But what did this general di&s;like of their acti|ons lead the People to: Not to draw the Sword at their own Repre&s;entatives, that had been to be <HI>felo de &s;e</HI> and Murther them&s;elves, but to apply them&s;elves to the Sovereign to di&s;&s;olve them, and upon this Application, the King did di&s;&s;olve them; and a late Proclamati|on for di&s;&s;olving the la&s;t Parliament of King <HI>William,</HI> acknowledges the People have a Right upon di&s;like of their Members proceeding to apply to the King to di&s;|&s;olve them. The Words of the Proclamation are, <HI>We have thought it Rea&s;onable in this Extraordinary Juncture,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<HI>to give our Subjects the Opportunity of choo&s;ing &s;uch Per|&s;ons to repre&s;ent them in Parliament, as they may judge mo&s;t likely to bring to effect their Ju&s;t and Pious Purpo&s;es.</HI> And in order thereto to Di&s;&s;olve this pre&s;ent Parliament.</P>
<P>If &s;o, If the People ought to have an Opportunity when they &s;ee cau&s;e to have a New Repre&s;entative, <HI>for that is the meaning,</HI> then the People are in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure Judges of the Actions and Management of their Repre&s;entatives, for el&s;e it could not be ju&s;t to make them Judges of the Continuance, or Determination of their Being.</P>
<P>Where then is the Fatality of &s;uch an Appeal to the People, &s;ince when they have been &s;omething unea&s;y on that Head, it has amounted to no more than to ad|dre&s;s for a Di&s;&s;olution; that if they do'nt like the&s;e they may have better, and the King from the Throne has declared, that 'tis rea&s;onable they &s;hould be Gratified.</P>
<P>I do not hereby ju&s;tify any of tho&s;e things which are complained of by the Dr. <HI>P.</HI> 28. how innumerable Pamphlets accu&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons in 1701, of not being mindful of the King's Honour, of being in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, wanting Affection to their Native Country, Zeal for its Religion, and as not intending to do what was needful to the Nations Safety; Nor do I &s;ay that Parliament were any ways guilty of that Charge, in all, or in any of the&s;e Branches. But I may be allowed to &s;ay this, and that is enough to my pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e; that if the Repre&s;entative Body of the People were really Guilty of any, or of all of tho&s;e Heads or Crimes, the People had certainly Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with them, and could not do le&s;s than apply to the Sovereign to di&s;mi&s;s them, and give them an Opportunity to &s;end better in their Room.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
I believe I may venture to &s;ay, 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible the People of <HI>England,</HI> call them by the wor&s;t Names you plea&s;e, the <HI>Rabble,</HI> the <HI>Mob,</HI> the <HI>Multitude,</HI> or any thing; I &s;ay, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the People of <HI>England</HI> can ever, either by Inclination, or by Contrivance, be brought to a di&s;like of Parliaments as &s;uch; they may find rea&s;on to di&s;like this or that Set of Men, but that the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould ever attempt to de&s;troy the Repre&s;entative, <HI>Qua Parliament.</HI> 'Tis impo&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>I reckon that's properly &s;aid to be impo&s;&s;ible as to Men, which they cannot do without forfeiting their, Rea&s;on; and all the Claim they have to the Know|ledge of their own Intere&s;t, Safety, Peace and Pro&s;pe|rity, which they cannot do without being Fools, and Mad-men; whatever Factions or Parties may be rai&s;ed, 'tis again&s;t a Faction and a Party, not again&s;t the Hou&s;e it &s;elf; and therefore I remember in one of the wor&s;t of tho&s;e numberle&s;s Pamphlets, which the Dr. takes no|tice of, among all the Gall again&s;t the Members of that Hou&s;e, it &s;till appeared they had none again&s;t the Con|&s;titution, by this following Line.</P>
<Q><L>For tho' we value Parliaments, we're out of love with you.</L></Q>
<P>If this be true, I'll examine no more what this Gen|tleman means by Appeals to the People from their Re|pre&s;entatives, for let him mean what he will, there can be no danger in them; becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould ever be again&s;t a free Repre&s;en|tative, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> all the cries therefore of the Danger of Appeals of the People are Vain and Trifling.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">
Yet our Author is po&s;itive, <HI>whether too po&s;itive or no, let others determine;</HI> that nothing can be of more dan|gerous Con&s;equence than to e&s;tabli&s;h, that the People of <HI>England</HI> and their Repre&s;entatives have di&s;tinct Rights; and yet I think with Submi&s;&s;ion, 'tis prov'd already, that nothing is more plain even from this Gentleman's own Book.</P>
<P><HI>All the Rights and Priviledges of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are the Peoples Rights and Priviledges;</HI> This I grant: But all the Peoples Rights and Priviledges are not the Rights and Priviledges of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, The Rights of the Elected are transferred from the Electors, but 'tis plain they have not devolved all their Rights.</P>
<P>And tho' the Collective Body of the People are not a fourth E&s;tate, yet they are the Center of the other three E&s;tates, from whom con&s;titution is derived, and for whom 'tis form'd.</P>
<P>Parliaments are neither Infallible nor Immortal, the Repre&s;entative may die and be di&s;&s;olved, but the Repre&s;ented Body remains as the great Center of Pow|er, the Fountain of Original Right, the la&s;t re&s;ort of Lives, Succe&s;&s;ions, and Governours.</P>
<P>To prove the Danger of the Appeals to the People, the Dr. brings in King <HI>Charles</HI> the I&s;t, in the Me&s;&s;ages and Declarations he publi&s;hed; and the Hou&s;e of Com|mons in the An&s;wer and Remon&s;trances, appealing to the People; <HI>and that,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>brought a Civil War:</HI> This is a new way of arguing.</P>
<P>Had not the King appealed to his Standard at <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> had not the Parliament appealed to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, all their Printing and appealing to the People had done nothing, Proclamations and Re|mon&s;trances had not been fatal if both &s;ides had not ap|pealed
<PB N="14" REF="17">
to the Sword. A Pen and Ink War draws no Blood, and all their Printing of Declarations and Remon|&s;trances, tended only to bya&s;s the People to this or that Party, and li&s;t in the War which both &s;ides prepar'd for.</P>
<P>There are many better rea&s;ons to be given for the beginning of that War, than their Printed Papers, the Foundations of that War was laid in the grievan|ces of Ship Money, Monopolies di&s;continuing of Par|liament, Cla&s;hing in Religion and the like; their Print|ing and Appeals to the People, were generally Recri|minations of Partys, by which both &s;ides Expos'd one another, but the ground of that War was lay'd too deep to pretend to be laid at that Door.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen who place the Confu&s;ions of the Civl-War, on both &s;ides appealing to the People, mu&s;t either be very ill Read in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, which I am &s;atisfyed this Gentlemen is not, or mu&s;t be content to pa&s;s over the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Points of Diffe|rence, between the King and Parliament, and place the wholl upon a Sub&s;equent Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>And yet in this very Ca&s;e the Author is gone from his Title, which he calls, appealing to the People from their Repre&s;entatives, and as an in&s;tance to Illu&s;trate it, brings in the very Repre&s;entatives appealing to them from them&s;elves, and the King al&s;o doing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From whence it Appears plain to me, that in all Ca&s;es of Extremity it has been the practice both of Kings, Partys, private Per&s;ons, and of Parliaments them&s;elves to appeal to the People, when matters of Right, publick Oppre&s;&s;ions, and Extraordinary Nice|ties of State come in Que&s;tion.</P>

<P>All the publick Declarations, and Manife&s;to's of Princes, are in this re&s;pect Appeals to the People. To go back no further than the Ca&s;e of <HI>Phillip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain;</HI> his Declaration and Pro&s;cription of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was a Solemn Appeal to all the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> complaining of the Rebellions, Factions, Inva&s;ions, and as he calls them Ingratitudes of that Prince, and at la&s;t inviting all his Subjects to do him Ju&s;tice upon the Traytor as he Terms him. <HI>Fam.

<P>Which very pro&s;cription was the cau&s;e which Incit|ed <HI>Balthazar Garrad,</HI> in an Impious and horrid man|ner, to A&s;&s;a&s;inate that Prince as he confe&s;t afterward, upon being Examin'd by Torture.</P>
<P>The Appology of that Prince was an Appeal to the People again, wherein he fully clears him&s;elf of all the Callumnies and A&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon him, of Un|dutifulne&s;s and Ingratitude, and Recriminates upon the King, and yet neither of the&s;e were the Grounds of that Civil-War, <HI>ibid.</HI> p. 180.</P>

<P>Yet in all the&s;e Ca&s;es the Appeals were not the Cau&s;es or Motives to a Civil-War, but the Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>Thus far I thought fit to Examine Forreign Hi&s;tory, to &s;how that Appeals to the People have been practi|ced by other Nations, where matters have grown to Ex|tremities between King and People, for indeed the People how much &s;oever Contemn'd, and Endeavoured to be &s;uppre&s;t are the la&s;t Re&s;ort in all the Extremities of a Nation.</P>

<P>What was the Lords coming to a great Council at the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> in the City of <HI>London,</HI> but a la&s;t Re&s;ort to the People? What was all the Appearance at <HI>Bodon Down</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> the Declaration of the Gentlemen at <HI>Nottingham?</HI> They were all the Re&s;ort to the People, or you mu&s;t re&s;olve them into Trea&s;ons, In&s;urrections and Rebellions.</P>
<P>Let any Man but put the Ca&s;e to <HI>January,</HI> 1688. the King was gone, there was no Repre&s;entative power in Being, nor any power in being which had any Legal Authority, to call a Repre&s;entative the whole Machine of Government was Unhing'd, and the &s;ub&s;tance di&s;|&s;olv'd, all Delegated Power cea&s;ed, all Commi&s;&s;i|ons determin'd, and none could grant more; there was no Officer no Magi&s;trate could act, or any Power to make new ones. Authority was at an End; all Men had an Equallity of Power, Laws indeed were in Being, but no Man had any ju&s;t Authority to put them in Execution.</P>
<P>Let any Man now tell me who had a ju&s;t Title to frame a new Government: 'Tis plain the next of Blood to the Crown did not pretend to it, all retreated to the great Original of Power the People; <HI>there was the la&s;t Re&s;ort,</HI> fir&s;t the Collective Body in &s;everal parts, without any Con&s;tituted Authority A&s;&s;embl'd to advi&s;e with the Prince, the Lords di&s;po&s;e of Governments, and the City Addre&s;&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for his protection, the Prince Summon&s;es the People to advi&s;e with him;

<P>If this Hi&s;tory, which all Men can remember to be true, be not a &s;ufficient Proof, that the la&s;t re&s;ort is in the People of <HI>England,</HI> then I will undertake to give more Proofs, but I plea&s;e my &s;elf with believing it can|not be contradicted. Whether the Gentleman I am con|cern'd with in this Ca&s;e will infer from hence, that our Government is Democratick or not, I am not at all con|cern'd about, but that in our Government and indeed, in all Governments the Nature of the thing implyes, that when Succe&s;&s;ive or Repre&s;entative Power cea&s;es, the People Collectively con&s;idered have a Native Right to make Settlements and Con&s;titutions, for the maintaing of Order and Ju&s;tice, and for the Currency and Execu|tion of the Laws; if not, Confu&s;ions and Inevitable De&s;truction, mu&s;t be the Effect of the Demi&s;e of a Line of Kings, or the Ce&s;&s;ation of a Delegated Power.</P>
<P>Let us come now to the expre&s;s point, which I &s;up|po&s;e our Author to mean; appealing from the Repre|&s;entatives to the People, and tho' I have the mo&s;t ha|zardous point of the Argumrnt in ca&s;e by Inadvertancy, I &s;hould offend the Repre&s;entatives of the Nation now
<PB N="22" REF="25">
&s;itting, yet as I re&s;olve to &s;ay nothing but what is in it &s;elf true, and ju&s;tified by infinite Precedents, I pre|&s;ume that honourable Hou&s;e never can re&s;ent that which comes in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with Truth in its Com|pany.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons have always been very cha|ry of the Priviledges and Honour of the People, whom they repre&s;ent, and cannot be thought to be U|&s;urping any Powers or Authorities over them, which by the Nature of the Thing, as well as by the de&s;ign of their Election, is not committed to them; and therefore, as it is already noted: No Hou&s;e ever attempted to a&s;|&s;ume to them&s;elves the Power of naming a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Repre&s;entative; but as it always lay in the Brea&s;t of the Sovereign to di&s;&s;olve a Parliament in being, &s;o it was always the Native inherent Right of the Free|holders of <HI>England</HI> to elect a New one.</P>
<P>This Power mu&s;t be di&s;tirct from the Repre&s;enta|tives; 'Twas never the De&s;ign of the People to dele|gate any Branch of this Power to their Repre&s;entatives; nor did ever any Parliament pretend to invade this Right, or to a&s;&s;ume it to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed that on the Di&s;&s;olution of a Parliament, and before the calling of another, a King &s;hould die; and being the la&s;t of his line, no Per&s;on had any Claim by Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, What mu&s;t become of the Government? Mu&s;t all the Confu&s;ions of Anarchy &s;ucceed a regular Government, or the Crown wait for who is &s;tronge&s;t to lay hold on it.</P>
<P>The Laws of Nature make a plain An&s;wer to all the&s;e Que&s;tions, Governments, and Con&s;titntions, as they were originally derived from the People, mu&s;t on
<PB N="23" REF="26">
all Occa&s;ions of a Di&s;&s;olution, or total Interruption, be re&s;tored from, and rebuilt upon the Native Power and Original Authority of the People.</P>
<P>But as this &s;eems to be a Mob Doctrine, and looks like &s;etting up the Rabble above Law; Its proper to enquire who are the&s;e People, of whom this original Power is thus a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Negatively, not all the Inhabitants, but po&s;itively all the Freeholders, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Land have certainly a Right in the Government of it, and if the&s;e are call|ed the People, to the&s;e there is a Ca&s;e wherein an Ap|peal to them is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If I do quote the &s;ame Tract again for this, 'tis becau&s;e no Man has ever yet thought fit to confront it either with Rea&s;on or Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I make no que&s;tion but Property of Land is the be&s;t Title to Government in the World; and if the King was univer&s;al Landlord, he ought to be univer&s;al Governor of Right, and the People &s;o living on his Lands ought to obey him,</Q> or go off of his Premi&s;es.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And if any &s;ingle Man in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould at any time come to be Landlord of the whole Freehold of <HI>England,</HI> he could indeed have no Right to Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the King, till the pre&s;ent legal Settlement of the Crown fail'd, be|ca u&s;e it was &s;ettled by tho&s;e that had then a Right to &s;ettle it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But he would immediately be the full Repre&s;entative of all the Countries in <HI>England,</HI> and might Elect him&s;elf Knight of the Shire for every County, and the Sheriff of every County mu&s;t Return him accordingly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;He would have all the Baronies and Titles of Honour which are entailed upon E&s;tates devolv'd upon him&punc; and
<PB N="24" REF="27">
upon any Expiration of the Settlement would be King by natural Right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And he would be King upon larger Terms than ever any Man was legally King of <HI>England;</HI> for he would be King by inherent Right of Property.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;When therefore I am &s;peaking of the Right of the People, I would be under&s;tood of the Freeholders, for all the other Inhabitants live upon Sufferance, and ei|ther are the Freeholders Servants or having Money to pay Rent live upon Conditions, and have no Title to their living in <HI>England,</HI> other than as Servants, but what they mu&s;t pay for.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Upon this foot it is that to this Day our Law &s;uffers not a Foreigner to Purcha&s;e any of the Freeholds of <HI>England:</HI> For if a Foreigner might Purcha&s;e, your Neighbours (having Mony to &s;pare) might come and buy you out of your own Country, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on by a legal and indi&s;putable Right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;This Original Right was the fir&s;t Foundation of the &s;everal Tenures of Land in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ome held of the King, &s;ome of the Lord, &s;ome by Knight Service, Soc|cage, and the like, and &s;ome were called Freeholds. The Lords of Mannors had their Homages, and their Services from their Tenants, as an Acknowledgment that the Right of the Land gave a certain Right of Government to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or over all the Tenants and Inhabitants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But he that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t Freehold was as much Lord of him&s;elf; and of that Freehold, as the greate&s;t Noble man in the Nation, he ow'd no Homage or Service, no, not to the King&punc; other than as limited by Laws of his own making that is as he was repre&s;ented in Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">
<Q>&startq;&endq;And as a thing which will put this Argument out of all que&s;tion. The Right to Lands, Mannors and Lord&s;hips, was not Originally a Right granted by Pa|tents from Kings or Acts of Parliament, but a natural Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion handed down by Cu&s;tom, and anci|ent U&s;age, as the Inheritance from the &s;till more anci|ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and Pre&s;cription, or U&s;age time out of Mind, is to this Day allowed to be a &s;ufficient Title in &s;everal Ca&s;es, where Conveyances, Deeds, Charters, and Writing of Eates are &s;ilent, e&s;pecially as to But|tinge and Boundings of Land, Highways, Foot-paths, Water Cour&s;es,</Q> Bridges, and the like.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;This Right, as all Right Originally, is Founded up|on Rea&s;on: For it would be highly unrea&s;onable, that tho&s;e People who have no &s;hare of the Hou&s;e &s;hould live in it whether he that built it will or no. No Per&s;on has any Right to live in <HI>England,</HI> but they to whom <HI>England</HI> belongs; the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> have it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; <HI>England</HI> is their own, and no Body has any thing to do here but them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;If they permit other People to live here, well and good, but no Man but a Freeholder lives here upon any Terms but <HI>permi&s;&s;u Superiorum,</HI> and he pays Rent for his Licen&s;e to live here.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Thus the Liberties and Priviledges of Towns and Cor|porations, are &s;ounded upon Acts of Parliament to con|firm Charters or Grants from the Crown, by which the Freeholders give their con&s;cent that &s;uch and &s;uch Bo|dies of Men living in &s;uch Towns, &s;hall enjoy certain Priviledges in Con&s;ideration of their being &s;o con&s;ide|rably &s;erviceable to the Nation, by paying Taxes, main|taining the Poor, by Manufactures, Trade, and the like, notwith&s;tanding they are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any part of the Freehold.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">
<Q>&startq;&endq;And 'tis ob&s;ervable, the King cannot give this Privi|lege, &s;o as to enable any of the&s;e Corporations to &s;end Repre&s;entatives to Parliament. None, but the Freehold|ers of <HI>England</HI> (and &s;uch Towns in Conjunction) to whom the Freeholders have already granted &s;uch Privi|lege, can give a Qualification of &s;uch a Nature, as is a receiving them into an equal &s;tate of Priviledge with a Freeholder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Every Man's Land is his own Property; and 'tis a Tre&s;pa&s;s in the Law for another Man to come upon his Ground without his Con&s;ent. If the Freeholders &s;hould all agree, That &s;uch a Man &s;hall not come upon their Land; That they will not Lett him a Hou&s;e for his Money; That who&s;e Land &s;oever he &s;ets his Foot on, the Owner &s;hall Indict him for a Tre&s;pa&s;s, as by Law he may,</Q> the Man mu&s;t fly the Nation of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Thus the Freeholders having a Right to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of <HI>England,</HI> the Rea&s;on mu&s;t be good that they mu&s;t have the &s;ame Right to the Government of them&s;elves, that they have to the Government of the re&s;t of the Inhabitants; and <HI>that there can be no Legal Power in</HI> Eng|land, <HI>but what has its Original in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; for Pro|perty is the Foundation of Power.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Nor is this Doctrine of Original Right any Deroga|tion to the ju&s;t and full Authority of Parliament, who may, notwith&s;tanding this, exerci&s;e all their full and extended Priviledges in as ample a Manner as is agreea|ble to all the ju&s;t Ends and Purpo&s;es for which they were fir&s;t De&s;igned and Intended.</P>
<P>If our Author would be under&s;tood in what he &s;peaks of to mean, only the little publick Efforts of Private Per&s;ons or Parties, who often expre&s;s di&s;&s;atis|faction at the Proceedings in Parliament, as they cla&s;h

<P>The Liberty taken in Print, di&s;covers &s;ometimes the Malice of Authors, and not &s;eldom pulls down Autho|rity on their Heads, but as Truth has the lea&s;t need of Advocates, &s;o 'tis ea&s;y to defend her, and the Parliament has never thought fit to re&s;train the Pre&s;s, becau&s;e their Actions being generally &s;quar'd by Truth and the Law, and de&s;ign'd for the publick Good they have rather coveted to &s;how them in the Light, than to li|mit the Enquiries of the World; choo&s;ing rather to &s;uffer &s;ome Indecencies from ill govern'd Pens, than to give the World the lea&s;t Shaddow of &s;aying, They conceal their Actions from the publick Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>But take the People in the Sen&s;e I have before ob&s;er|ved, and even Parliament them&s;elves have always ap|pealed to them, have been careful to print any remark|able thing which has been before them, that tho&s;e who cho&s;e them to &s;it there, may &s;ee and be &s;atisfied how careful they are of the general Good, and of di&s;charg|ing the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>What are the &s;everal Publications made by Parlia|ment of the Controver&s;y between the Hou&s;es, both up|on Occa&s;ion of the late Impeachments, and on the oc|ca&s;ional Bill, but Appeals to the People and Te&s;timoni|als of the Candor of their Proceedings.</P>
<P>In all material Ca&s;es, the Repre&s;entatives have thus appealed to the People, and why it &s;hould be &s;o Cri|minal, or &s;o Dangerous for any Man el&s;e to Appeal
<PB N="28" REF="31">
thither al&s;o, does not appear to me, &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould ever be, that the Free-Holders of <HI>England</HI> can be reduced to &s;uch a Depravation of their Rea&s;on, as to demoli&s;h the Foundation on which they &s;tand, and pull down their own Hou&s;e upon their Heads.</P>
<P>Neither is this appealing to the People, <HI>which tho&s;e Publications of Kings and Parliaments are called</HI> any thing more or le&s;s, but the Vindication of the Proceedings of the Per&s;ons and Parties, and &s;etting their Ca&s;es as fa r as they thought they required in a true Light, and no People who have had Truth and Hone&s;ty on their &s;ide, have ever thought it below them to appeal to all the World.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId, thus appealed to all the Peo|ple in his Declaration, about the <HI>Rye</HI> Plot, King <HI>William</HI> in his Declaration, at his coming over into <HI>England;</HI> and all the Kings of the World have u&s;ed it as a con|&s;tant Method to make publick Declarations, which in this Authors Sen&s;e are Appeals to the People upon e|very extraordinary Revolution of Affairs; the Decla|ration of the <HI>French</HI> King at placing his Grand&s;on on the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Manife&s;to's and Declaration of the Emperor at his &s;ending Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> and now again at the Transferring the Crown to the Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> are all Appeals to the People of <HI>Spain,</HI> to excite them to transfer their Obedience to, or from this, or that Party, as they may be prevailed upon by their Rea|&s;ons, to believe this or that the mo&s;t Rightful Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>But to come yet clo&s;er to the Point, the meaning, as I under&s;tand this Gentleman, is, that 'tis his Opinion that 'tis not in the Power of the People of <HI>England</HI> to Controul, Limit, or check their Repre&s;entatives, and that &s;uch appealings as we have been &s;peaking of, prompts the People to ruffle the Parliaments, and to que&s;tion their Proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">
This is an Argument in which the Author has this Advantage of me, that what he advances has no dan|ger in it, and what I ought to reply to it may, tho' it be really true, and under the re&s;traint of this Cir|cum&s;tance, I cannot &s;ay that to it which I think the Ca&s;e will bear.</P>
<P>But I am of the Opinion that there is a ju&s;t Appeal from the Repre&s;entative to the Collective Body of the People. In &s;ome particular extraordinary Ca&s;e, and tho' I do not love to repeat things, I ask Pardon for it now, what el&s;e can the Doctor mean, when he &s;ays, <HI>P.</HI> 15. the Parliament, <HI>Cannot touch Fundamentals, and that if they do any thing to the Peoples De&s;truction, it cannot bind them,</HI> what can be the meaning of this, but that there is an Appeal from them to the People, if they &s;hould attempt any thing to the Peoples De&s;tru|ction.</P>
<P>To him that &s;hall tell me the Hou&s;e of Commons can never do any thing to injure the People; I mu&s;t reply as before, and with as good Authority, the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> cannot act De&s;tructive of their own Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>I do not &s;peak it with a De&s;ign to le&s;&s;en Parliaments in <HI>England,</HI> and I know them to be the Bulwark of the Peoples Liberties, but they are not infallible, they may err, and were it &s;afe to &s;peak all the Truth, perhaps I might &s;ay there has been a Time when they have been mi&s;taken in many things.</P>
<P>Now if a Parliament &s;hould mi&s;take, and that fatal|ly too, &s;hall the People of <HI>England</HI> have no Method to let them know it, then are they in wor&s;e Bondage to their Repre&s;entative than to the Sovereign, what &s;hall the People do, they may without doubt find out mode&s;t Me|thods
<PB N="30" REF="33">
to let them know they are in the wrong, and to inform them both that they &s;ee it and di&s;like it.</P>
<P>I could perhaps name the Time when the People have &s;een Rea&s;on to complain of &s;ome Steps their Repre&s;entatives had made, but my Author can never name the time whenever the People of <HI>England</HI> attempted or di&s;covered a De&s;ign to lop off this Brar$h of the Con&s;titution, and demoli&s;h the ju&s;t Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>And after all, the Tendency this has to Peace and Union, is a My&s;tery pa&s;t finding out, the Coherence this has with the Title of the Book is a Thing hid from Humane Under&s;tanding, to deprive the People of their ju&s;t Right, and &s;et up their Repre&s;entative with an Au|thority they never pretended to them&s;elves; may have a Title of Peace, but carries none in the Meaning. I could &s;ay &s;omething to the Doctor's plea&s;ant Propo&s;al of Peace in his Introduction, <HI>P.</HI> 17. <HI>Implying, that the Re|&s;entments on all &s;ides &s;hou'd be laid by, and the weaker Party cajol'd into a Peace, till foreign Wars are over, and what then?</HI> Then as you were.</P>
<P>But as I may examine &s;ome other Chapters of this Book, there cannot want Occa&s;ion for Reflections on that head.</P>
