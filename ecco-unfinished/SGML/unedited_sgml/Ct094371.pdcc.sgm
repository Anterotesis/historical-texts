<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO Sir <HI>JOHN BLOUNT,</HI> Bar.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_WONDER not BLOUNT, who&s;e magick Hand</L>
<L>Lifts to the Clouds thy native Land,</L>
<L>That in the&s;e bu&s;y, golden Times,</L>
<L>Thy Ears are teaz'd with trifling Rhimes;</L>
<L>For it's a common Practice grown</L>
<L>Among&s;t us Scriblers of the Town,</L>
<L>When Fortune &s;ays, poor Rogues! go whi&s;tle,</L>
<L>To &s;ome <HI>great Man</HI> to &s;end Epi&s;tle;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">One, that has Will as well as Power,</L>

<L>A State&s;man grew, and <HI>S&mdash;t</HI> a Dean.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHENEVER therefore, Madam Fame</L>
<L>Is pleas'd to rai&s;e &s;ome mighty Name,</L>
<L>For Service to his Country paid,</L>
<L>In Battle, Coun&s;el, Law or Trade,</L>
<L>One of our meagre Order &s;pies him,</L>
<L>And for his Patron clo&s;ely plies him;</L>
<L>His next New Play to him addre&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>Hangs on him, flatters and care&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>In Panegyricks, Dedications,</L>
<L>And &s;lips no popular Occa&s;ions:</L>
<L>If he goes Five Miles out of Town,</L>
<L>The Mu&s;e mu&s;t wait upon him down,</L>
<L>And in a Fu&s;tian, high-flown Ode,</L>

<L><PB N="5" REF="4">Nay, if the Minion but makes Water,</L>

<L><HI>BUT who'd be publick at this Rate?</HI></L>
<L>Why Faith, Sir, 'tis a wretched State.</L>
<L>Full of Vexation, full of Noi&s;e,</L>
<L>And con&s;cious of no humane Joys;</L>
<L>A turbulent, unquiet Scene,</L>
<L>With &s;carce a peaceful Hour between;</L>
<L>Angels by turns, and <HI>Daemons</HI> &s;til'd,</L>
<L>For ever flatter'd, or revil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Thee, O BLOUNT, in Fame grown old,</L>
<L>This Truth is needle&s;s to be told.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">O &s;ay, for mighty Schemes renown'd,</L>

<L>How does each painful Evening clo&s;e,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHAT Miracles enlarge my Thought,</L>

<L>Forgetting all her Woes and Fears,</L>
<L>BRITAIN no more with Envy hears</L>
<L>Of tho&s;e proud, fabled Streams of old,</L>
<L>That flow'd o're &s;hining Sands of Gold;</L>
<L>Thy Mines, PERU, &s;urprize no more&mdash;</L>
<L>For &s;ee! On ALBION'S happy Shore,</L>

<L><PB N="7" REF="6">Thro' every Realm her Credit reigns,</L>

<L>The Nation, that di&s;tre&s;s'd of late,</L>

<L>Renew'd in all her ancient Strength,</L>
<L>Poizes once more the Lance's Length,</L>

<L>SO MOSES &s;mote the barren Rock,</L>
<L>(An Emblem of the SOUTH-SEA Stock!)</L>
<L>Which touch'd with his caele&s;tial Rod,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, for the Labours of this Year,</L>
<L>Thy Toils, Fatigues, and publick Care,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">May'&s;t Thou an Age unharra&s;s'd live,</L>

<L>Pre&s;erv'd by thy all-skilful Hand!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT &s;till my Bu&s;ine&s;s I forget;</L>
<L>Why, Sir, who pay a Nation's Debt,</L>
<L>By all the Wonders Thou ha&s;t wrought,</L>
<L><HI>Pilgarlick</HI> has not got a Groat?</L>
<L>Oft am I ask'd, NICK, prithee now,</L>

<L>To which I &s;hake my Ears, and cry,</L>
<L>D&mdash;n it! I've none; the more Fool I!</L>
<L>For, Sir, 'twould vex a Cat, you know,</L>
<L>While Riches all around one flow,</L>
<L>('Twas poor, old TANTALUS'S Ca&s;e)</L>
<L>To keep a &s;tarving, hungry Face;</L>
<L>In his new Berlin to behold,</L>
<L>All flaming with Brocade and Gold,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8">A Coxcomb loll, who, but la&s;t Year,</L>
<L>A Livery was content to wear,</L>
<L>Now &s;umptuou&s;ly at <HI>Caviack</HI>'s dine,</L>
<L>And drink the very be&s;t of Wine;</L>
<L><HI>Burgundy, Hermitage, Champaign,</HI></L>
<L>Liquors, that fire the dulle&s;t Brain!</L>
<L>While I perhaps, ill-fated Sinner!</L>
<L>Want Half a Crown to buy a Dinner,</L>
<L>Or at a cheap Cook's-Shop regale</L>
<L>On a <HI>Sheep's-Heart,</HI> and Pot of Ale.</L>
<L>But, Sir, all this is not the wor&s;t,</L>
<L>Still am I more compleatly cur&s;t,</L>
<L>My old Companions all grown rich,</L>
<L>Grow proud, and bid me ki&s;s their Breech;</L>
<L>When at the Coffee-Hou&s;e we meet,</L>
<L>Or in the <HI>Alley,</HI> or the Street,</L>
<L>On me they never ca&s;t an Eye,</L>
<L>But take their Snuff and &s;houlder by.</L>
<L>Nay LAURA (which afflicts me mo&s;t)</L>
<L>So many Years my con&s;tant Toa&s;t,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9">So warmly and &s;o truly lov'd,</L>
<L>Fal&s;e to our mutual Vows has prov'd;</L>
<L>Her Fortune chang'd, &s;he changes too,</L>
<L>(Rich Maids ala&s;s! are &s;eldom true!)</L>
<L>Spurns at my low, <HI>plebeian</HI> Fires,</L>
<L>And to an Equipage a&s;pires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHAT humbly therefore I reque&s;t,</L>
<L>(Oh! lay it kindly to your Brea&s;t)</L>
<L>Is, that when next all People flock,</L>
<L>To get <HI>Sub&s;criptions</HI> to your <HI>Stock,</HI></L>
<L>You wou'd be pleas'd, 'tis what I crave,</L>
<L>Not to forget your humble Slave;</L>
<L>For tho' with all my Pains and Parts,</L>
<L>I cannot &s;moak the&s;e <HI>jobbing</HI> Arts,</L>
<L>Yet, like a certain Popi&s;h Tribe,</L>
<L>Implicitly I would SUBSCRIBE:</L>
<L><HI>Five Hundred,</HI> or a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI> Pound</L>
<L>In your next Li&s;t, would make me &s;ound,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10">Drown all my Sorrows, if I nick it,</L>
<L>And make me merry as a Cricket.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT to your Care, what Claim have I,</L>
<L>On whom you never ca&s;t your Eye?</L>
<L>What Worth my &s;elf, or worthy Friend,</L>
<L>That can my Per&s;on recommend?</L>
<L>Faith not at all&mdash;but I am told,</L>
<L>That want of Friends, and want of Gold,</L>
<L>(A Mind &s;o godlike you inherit)</L>
<L>Compen&s;ates for the want of Merit:</L>
<L>Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t, on Friend and Foe,</L>
<L>Like Heav'n, your Favours you be&s;tow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU &s;ee, Sir, that I neither flatter,</L>
<L>Nor, like mo&s;t Poets, mince the Matter,</L>
<L>Who never tell you what they want,</L>
<L>Nor what it is they'd have you grant,</L>
<L>Yet leave an Innuendo &s;till,</L>
<L>That they &s;hall take it bloody ill,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11">If you don't &s;traitway find out what</L>
<L>The meally Ra&s;cals would be at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT how much better would it be,</L>
<L>For every Poet, ju&s;t like me,</L>
<L>To tell his Meaning at a Word,</L>
<L><HI>I want ju&s;t Fifty Pounds, my Lord;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which Sum, if you refu&s;e to give,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I &s;hall eternally believe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For all, what I have &s;aid before,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That you're a &s;neaking Son of a Wh&mdash;re.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS would be hone&s;t, downright Dealing,</L>
<L>And might de&s;erve a Fellow-feeling;</L>
<L>But when a Blockhead of a Bard</L>
<L>Declares, <HI>He looks for no Reward,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And that his Lord&s;hip's &s;hining Worth</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was the &s;ole Motive on God's Earth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That made him &s;ay, what he has &s;aid</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>When all this while it was for Bread;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12">Were I his Lord&s;hip, for the Je&s;t, Sir,</L>
<L>I would not give the Dog a Te&s;ter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For after all, your Dedicators,</L>
<L>Howe're they may di&s;gui&s;e their Matters,</L>
<L>Will prove, when they have &s;tood the Te&s;t,</L>
<L>But <HI>genteel Mumpers</HI> at the be&s;t;</L>
<L>For where's the Difference, prithee &s;ay,</L>
<L>If both ask Money, in their Way,</L>
<L>Whether they beg in Pro&s;e or Rhime,</L>
<L>In vulgar Gibberi&s;h, or &s;ublime?</L>
<L><HI>Your Charity,</HI> the Beggar cries,</L>
<L>And &s;hakes his Head, and rolls his Eyes;</L>
<L>BAYS gives indeed a finer Touch,</L>
<L>But &s;till his Words imply as much.</L>
<L>The Beggar coaxes every Donor,</L>
<L>With <HI>Noble Ma&s;ter, dear your Honour!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Poetick Alm&s;men</HI> do the &s;ame,</L>
<L>They tell you of your ancient Fame,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13">How long your Family has &s;tood,</L>
<L>An Age, perhaps, before the Flood.</L>
<L>The Beggar, give him but a Penny,</L>
<L>Will wi&s;h you Forty Times as many,</L>
<L>Then leave you with a kind Oration&mdash;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t &s;o does every Dedication:</L>
<L><HI>That you may long enjoy your Health,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Long live in Plea&s;ure, and in Wealth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And late be &s;natch'd into the Grave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is what I &s;till &s;incerely crave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Your mo&s;t devoted, humble Slave.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT what from hence do I infer?</L>
<L>Why only this, illu&s;trious Sir,</L>
<L>That no Man &s;hould deny the Trade,</L>
<L>By which his Fortune's to be made;</L>
<L>That Authors, therefore, in their <HI>Letters</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dedicatory</HI> to their Betters,</L>
<L>Should in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> let them know</L>
<L>How with their Bellies Matters go,</L>
<L><PB REF="14">And not &s;et Gentlemen the Task</L>
<L>To give them what they never ask.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT you, Sir, can't make this Excu&s;e;</L>
<L>And therefore &s;leep in Peace, my Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>Secure that e'er a few Months end,</L>
<L>Relying on &s;o good a Friend,</L>
<L>We both &s;hall leave this &s;ervile Garret,</L>
<L>Good Wild-fowl eat, and drink good Claret;</L>
<L>And, &s;ince to Him we owe our Wealth,</L>
<L>Never forget Sir JOHN'S good Health.</L>
