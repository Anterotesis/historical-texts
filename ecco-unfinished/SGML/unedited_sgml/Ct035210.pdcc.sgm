<P>Fir&s;t, good Peter Quince, &s;ay what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and &s;o grow on to a point.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, our play is the mo&s;t lamentable

comedy, and mo&s;t cruel death of Pyramus and Thi&s;by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very good piece of work, I a&s;&s;ure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the &s;crowl. Ma&s;ters, &s;pread your|&s;elves.</P>

<P>A lover that kills him&s;elf mo&s;t gallantly for love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bot.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That will a&s;k &s;ome tears in the true perform|ing of it: If I do it let the audience look to their eyes; I will move &s;torms; I will condole in &s;ome mea&s;ure. To the re&s;t; yet, my chief humour is for a tyrant; I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in. <Q>&startq;To make all &s;plit the raging rocks and &s;hivering &s;hocks &s;hall break the locks of pri&s;on-gates, and Phibbus carr &s;hall &s;hine &endq;from far, and make and mar the fooli&s;h fates!</Q> This was lofty.

<P>If you &s;hould do it too terribly, you would fright the Dutche&s;s and the Ladies, that they would &s;hriek, and that were enough to hang us all.</P>

<P>I grant you, friends, if you &s;hould fright the Ladies out of their wits, they would have no more di&s;cretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice &s;o, that I will roar you as gently as any &s;ucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any night|ingale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a &s;weet fac'd man, a proper man as one

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Quin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some of your French-crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But, ma&s;ters here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, reque&s;t you, and de&s;ire you to con them by to-mor|row night; and meet me in the palace-wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight, there we will rehear&s;e; for if we meet in the city, we &s;hall be dog'd with company, and our devices known.
