<P>Why the affair is this.

But to go on with my tale, my dame one day looking over the pa|pers, came running to me; now Ephraim, &s;ays &s;he, thy bu&s;ine&s;s is done, rare news, lad; here is a man at the other end of the town, that will make thee a <HI>&s;peecher</HI> at once, and out &s;he pull'd your propo&s;als. Ah Alice, &s;ays I, thee be'&s;t but a fool, why I know that man, he is all upon his fun, he lectures&mdash;why, 'tis all but a bam&mdash;well, 'tis but &s;eeing, &s;ays &s;he, &s;o, <HI>wolens nolens</HI>, &s;he would have me come hither; now if &s;o be you be &s;erious, I &s;hall think my money wi&s;ely be&s;tow'd; but if it be only your comical works, I can tell you, you &s;hall &s;ee me no more.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>SUDS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am proud to hear you &s;ay &s;o. Indeed I am. I did <HI>&s;peechify</HI> once at a ve&s;try concerning new lettering the church buckets, and came off cutely enough, and to &s;ay the truth, that was the thing that provok'd me to go to Pew|terers-Hall.<STAGE><HI>Sits down again.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I flatter my&s;elf, that in propor|tion to the difference of abilities in your two in&s;tructors, you will here make a tolerable progre&s;s. But now, Sir, with your favour, we will proceed to explain the nature of our de&s;ign, and I hope in the proce&s;s, you, gen|tlemen, will find entertainment, and you, Sir, information.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Mr. Foote then proceeds to his lecture.</HI></STAGE>
<P>My plan, gentlemen, is to be con&s;ider'd as a &s;uper&s;tructure on that admirable founda|tion laid by the modern profe&s;&s;or of Engli&s;h, both our labours tending to the &s;ame general end; the perfectioning of our countrymen in a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article, the right u&s;e of their native language.</P>
<P>But what he has happily begun, I have the vanity to think I have as happily fini&s;h'd; he has, it is true, introduc'd you into the body of the church, but I conduct you into the quoir of the cathedral: Or, to explain my&s;elf by a more familiar allu&s;ion, tho' he is the Poitier who
<PB N="10" REF="13">
teaches you the &s;tep and the grounds; yet I am the Gallini who gives you the air, and the grace of the minuet.</P>
<P>His aim is propriety alone; mine propriety with elegance.</P>
<P>For tho' reading, &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, not only by tho&s;e of tender years, but the adult; not only by children, but even by grown men and women; not only in our private &s;e|minaries, but in our publick univer&s;ities, is al|lowed to be a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient towards the formation of an orator; yet, a great many other rules, a great many other precepts, are re|qui&s;ite to obtain his perfection.</P>
<P>Nay, perhaps we might, to &s;upport an ar|gument without the danger of a defeat, at lea&s;t if we may tru&s;t ob&s;ervation, that of all the pro|fe&s;&s;ions that require a verbal intercour&s;e with the public, there is no one to whom reading is of &s;o little utility as that of oratory.</P>
<P>I need not in&s;i&s;t upon this head, as I be|lieve every gentleman's experience will fur|ni&s;h him with in&s;tances of men eminent in oratory, who, from an early vivacity, have neglected, or the indulgence of their parents have been emancipated from the attention and application nece&s;&s;ary, it is true, to acquire this rugged art; but at the &s;ame time &s;o ill|&s;uited to their tender years, and &s;o oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e innocent amu&s;ements in which children are known univer&s;ally to delight. <HI>Thwart not a child, for you &s;poil his temper</HI>,&mdash;is, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="14">
ought to be, an Engli&s;h proverb, as it is an univer&s;al practice.</P>
<P>I would not here be under&s;tood to depre|ciate the u&s;efulne&s;s of reading, or to detract from the exceeding merit of the profe&s;&s;or's plan; no, my meaning is only ju&s;t to drop a a hint that I may occa&s;ionally u&s;e him as a walking-&s;tick; a kind of an <HI>elegantly clouded Mocoa</HI>, or an <HI>airy Anamaboo:</HI> yet, that it is by no means my intention to depend upon him as <HI>a &s;upport</HI>, or lean upon him as <HI>a crutch</HI>; in a word, he will be rather ornamental than nece&s;|&s;ary tome.</P>
<P>But u&s;ele&s;s as his plan is to me, I &s;incerely wi&s;h it &s;ucce&s;s for the &s;ake of the public; and if my influence was equal to my inclination, I would have a law enacted, upon the plan of the militia bill, that annually, or biennially, draughts &s;hould be made from every pari&s;h of two, three, or more, as in that act of able bodied, &s;o in this of intelligent per&s;ons, who, at the expence of the &s;everal counties, &s;hould be &s;ent to the capital, and there compelled to go thro' as many cour&s;es of the profe&s;&s;or's lec|tures as he &s;hall deem &s;ufficient: thus, by tho&s;e periodical rural detachments, the whole nation will in a few years be compleatly &s;erved, and a &s;tock of learning laid in that will la&s;t 'till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Would our rulers but adopt this &s;cheme! how &s;uperior would England be even to the mo&s;t illu&s;trious periods of Greece and Rome!
<PB N="12" REF="15">
what an unrival'd happine&s;s for us, what an eternal fund of fame for them! ye Solons, ye Lycurgu&s;es, ye Numas hide your dimini&s;h'd heads, &s;ee what a revolution two laws in a few years have produc'd, &s;ee a whole people &s;unk in more than Gothic ignorance, accu&s;tom'd to no other iron implements than the pacific plough-&s;hear, or the harmle&s;s &s;pade, &s;tart out at once profound &s;cholars and veteran &s;oldiers: If at this happy period, a Frenchman thinking any thing out of his own country worthy his attention &s;hould conde&s;cend to pay this kingdom a vi&s;it; methinks, I anticipate the account he will give of us at his return, (like his countryman of old, who at the taking of Rome, bur&s;ting into the capitol, and there finding the &s;enate fix'd and immoveable in their &s;eats, declar'd them an a&s;&s;embly of kings), &s;o will he at once pronounce the whole Briti&s;h nation to be an army of generals, and one congregation of doctors. Happy country! where the <HI>Arma &amp; Toga</HI> are &s;o fortunately blended, as to pre|vent all contention for the pre-eminence.</P>
<P>I know but one objection that can be made to this plan, and that merely a temporary one; that the culture of our lands will &s;u&s;tain an infinite injury, if &s;uch a number of pea&s;ants were to deparochiate, there being already &s;carce hands &s;ufficient, from the recruits con|&s;tantly made for Germany, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to carry on the common bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">But what are riches, peri&s;hable commodities, glittering, tran&s;itory, fallacious goods, when compar'd to the &s;ub&s;tantial incorruptible en|dowments of the mind: this truth is indeed happily inculcated by an old Engli&s;h adage;</P>
<Q><L>When lands and goods are gone and &s;pent,</L>
<L>Then learning is mo&s;t excellent.</L></Q>
<P>This &s;en&s;ible and poetical di&s;tich, I would recommend to Mr. Profe&s;&s;or, as a motto for his intended treati&s;e; but I &s;uppo&s;e he is al|ready well provided with an apt <HI>Latin</HI>, if not a <HI>Greek</HI> one, to either of which I mu&s;t yield the preference.</P>
<P>But to wave this ethical argument, I think I can ea&s;ily foil the force of this objection, by a natural and obvious <HI>Succedaneum</HI>. Suppo&s;e a clau&s;e was to be added to the bill for the im|portation of tallow, raw hides, and live cattle from Ireland, that during this literary emigra|tion, a &s;ufficient number of inhabitants of that country may be tran&s;ported hither to &s;upply the vacancy; but here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that for this purpo&s;e an act of parliament is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; for tho' it would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible for us in our pre|&s;ent condition, to get in even our harve&s;ts, without the aid of hands annually exported for that purpo&s;e from Ireland; yet this is at be&s;t but an illicit trade, and the men them&s;elves are to be con&s;ider'd under the article of &s;mug|gled goods: a very heavy penalty being laid
<PB N="14" REF="17">
by &s;tatute on all ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, who &s;hall venture to import any of the above cited com|modity into this realm, without &s;pecial li|cence; to this purpo&s;e I recollect a ca&s;e in point, the fifth of William and Mary, Ban. Reg. The king contra Oflaarty. Vide V. Rep. vol. 3. chap. 9. page 4.</P>
<P>But if this &s;hould be thought by the people in power too great an indulgence to the Iri&s;h, as we have never been remarkably profu&s;e in our favours to our loyal and affectionate &s;i&s;ter; I &s;ee no other method of redre&s;&s;ing the ima|ginary evil, than by exempting from this &s;er|vice all the males 'till a general peace, and accepting in their room, a &s;uitable number of di&s;creet middle aged females; and the&s;e, when they have been properly perfected in the my|&s;teries of our language, may be return'd to their &s;everal pari&s;hes, and there form little in|fantine communities of literati, which will be a &s;tock for the &s;ucceeding generation; and indeed upon con&s;ideration, I don't know whether this won't prove the be&s;t method for the in|troduction and univer&s;al propagation of the plan.</P>
<P>For the Engli&s;h common people, naturally &s;ullen and ob&s;tinate, and religiou&s;ly attach'd to their old cu&s;toms, might be &s;hock'd and &s;can|daliz'd to &s;ee at one bold &s;troke, the fe&s;cues, and fa&s;ces, which have been from time im|memorial con&s;ign'd to one, or more matron in every village, ravi&s;h'd at once from their

<P>When I ventur'd to affirm that the profe&s;&s;ion of an orator, might exi&s;t independently of an accurate knowledge of the arrangement, and different combinations of the four and twenty letters, &s;o far as <STAGE><HI>in the words of the Profe&s;&s;or</HI></STAGE>, they relate to their being the arbitrary marks of meaning upon paper; yet, I would not be under&s;tood to a&s;&s;ert this generally, as to every &s;pecies of oratory, but to confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e particular branches, only where the ora|tor's own mind &s;ugge&s;ts the matter that his own mouth di&s;charges: For in&s;tance, now, as when affairs of &s;tate are weigh'd at a com|mon-council, religious points militated at the Robin-hood, the arts and &s;ciences handled in the Strand, or politicks debated near We&s;t|min&s;ter-abby; here the arguments, and words given are &s;uppos'd to ari&s;e from the imme|diate impul&s;e of the giver; but where there are concurrent agents, as in the oratory peculiar to the pulpit, and the &s;tage, where one indivi|dual furni&s;hes the matter, and another ad|mini&s;ters the manner, the ca&s;e is widely dif|ferent.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, a tolerable proficiency in reading is indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite, as &s;carce any memory but the late Mr. Heydigger's
<PB N="16" REF="19">
could retain to any degree of certainty, the various parts of the liturgy, the old, and new te&s;tament, briefs, faculties, excommunications, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and a lap&s;e on tho&s;e &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ions might be attended with very aukward circum&s;tances: nor would I here be &s;uppos'd to in&s;inuate, that the pieces of oratory deli|ver'd from the pulpit, are not the compo&s;ition of the deliverer, no&mdash;This is &s;o far from be|ing generally the ca&s;e, that I have often heard complaints made again&s;t particular agents, that they have forc'd upon their congregations their own crude, and in&s;ipid productions, when at the &s;ame time, their native language would furni&s;h them with &s;o exten&s;ive, and noble col|lection of admirable materials. But here the auditor, unle&s;s he be well read in theology, may be led into a mi&s;take; for there are &s;ome men, who, by a particular happine&s;s in their manner, have the addre&s;s to make the works of other men &s;o ab&s;olutely their own, that there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the difference; at this the poet hints in his <HI>male dum recitas</HI>, &amp;c. For the&s;e various rea&s;ons, I think a warm application to the art of reading, cannot be too &s;trongly recommended to the profe&s;&s;ors of this kind of oratory.</P>
<P>With regard to the profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;tage, tho' reading is undoubtedly u&s;eful, yet, as the performer is to repeat, and not to read, the deficience may be &s;upply'd by the introduction of a third agent, viz. a per&s;on to read to him 'till
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the words are rooted in his memory. This ex|pedient, tho' tedious, I have known frequently practis'd with good &s;ucce&s;s: little blunders will now and then unavoidably ari&s;e, either from the mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the &s;econd agent, or the ig|norance, or waggery of the third; but the&s;e &s;lips are generally unob&s;erv'd, or thro' inattention, or indulgence, overlook'd by an audience. But to return to the con&s;ideration of my own plan, from which, no temptation &s;hall for the future &s;educe me to digre&s;s.</P>
<P>We will fir&s;t, then, con&s;ider the utility of oratory.</P>
<P>Secondly, the di&s;tinct and various kinds, or &s;pecies of that &s;cience, as they are practis'd at this day in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, we will demon&s;trate that every branch of Engli&s;h oratory is peculiarly our own, owes its ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and perfection to this country, and was not only unknown to the antients, but is entirely repugnant to all tho&s;e principles they have endeavour'd to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that any rhetorical &s;y&s;tem now exi&s;ting, in&s;tead of a cro&s;s in the hands, with letters to direct you on your road, will prove only, but a Will in the Wi&s;p to confound, perplex, and bewilder you.</P>
<P>Fifthly, from hence will re&s;ult a nece&s;&s;ity, for the immediate e&s;tabli&s;hment of an academy, for the promulgation and inculcation of mo|dern oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="21">To which academy, the author of the&s;e propo&s;als, does hope, &s;ixthly, that he &s;hall be appointed perpetual profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Perhaps, it may not be impertinent here to ob&s;erve, that the author has indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid|ed, and will in the cour&s;e of this treati&s;e avoid all poetical allu&s;ion; all grandeur of expre&s;&s;ion, all &s;plendor of diction, in &s;hort, renounce every rhetorical prop, as knowing that on di|dactic &s;ubjects, order, &s;implicity, and per&s;pi|cuity are the means to gain his end, which is not to gratify the imagination, but to improve and poli&s;h the under&s;tanding of my country|men.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, we are to demon&s;trate the uti|lity of oratory: and, this we flatter our&s;elves will, in a great mea&s;ure be evident from the con&s;ideration of its univer&s;ality, and the di&s;|tinctions it procures, both lucrative and honour|able, to any man eminent in the art.</P>
<P>There is, by the con&s;titution of this king|dom, an a&s;&s;embly of many individuals, who, as the &s;eventh &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on, is born a phy&s;ician, are orators by hereditary right; that is, by birth they are enabled to give their opinions, and &s;entiments on all &s;ubjects, where the intere&s;t of their country is concern'd: To this, we are to add another a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;t|ing of 558 individuals, where, tho' the &s;ame privilege is enjoy'd as in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; yet this advantage is not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in virtue of any inherent natural right, but is obtain'd in
<PB N="19" REF="22">
con&s;equence of an annual, triennial, or &s;ep|tennial deputation from the whole body of the people; if then we add to this li&s;t the number of all tho&s;e candidates who are ambitious of this honour, with the infinite variety of changes that a revolution of twenty years will produce, we cannot e&s;timate tho&s;e funds of national orators in <HI>e&s;&s;e, po&s;&s;e</HI>, and <HI>velle</HI>, to a &s;maller quan|tity than 20,000; and this, I believe, by the di&s;ciples of Demoivre, will be thought a very moderate computation.</P>
<P>The two orders of the long robe next de|mand our attention; and as the pre-eminence is unque&s;tionably due to the prie&s;thood, let us con&s;ider what number of per&s;ons is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply that &s;ervice? England is divided into nine thou&s;and nine hundred and thirteen pari&s;hes: now, if we &s;uppo&s;e two pa&s;tors for every pari&s;h, this learned body will be found to con&s;i&s;t of nineteen thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-&s;ix individuals; but as the mo&s;t &s;acred characters are no more exempted from the fatal &s;troke that puts a temporary period to our exi&s;tence, than the prophane, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that a provi&s;ion &s;hould be made of fit and able per&s;ons; &s;o that at all events there be no lack of labourers in this plentiful vineyard: nor has the policy of this nation been &s;o blinded as not to guard again&s;t this po&s;&s;ible contin|gency, by erecting &s;chools, &s;eminaries, and uni|ver&s;ities, in which a convenient quantity of our youth are properly trained, in order to fill
<PB N="20" REF="23">
up cha&s;ms which may be occa&s;ionally made by the in&s;atiable &s;cythe of death. If then we e&s;timate this corps de re&s;erve at the half only of the &s;tanding force, we &s;hall find the army entire amount to 29,739.</P>
<P>I fore&s;ee that the objection will be made to this calculation, viz. That two pa&s;tors to every pari&s;h is a mo&s;t exorbitant and impro|bable charge; for that many pari&s;hes, from impropriations, appropriations, and other acci|dents, in&s;tead of two are &s;carce able to &s;up|port one pa&s;tor; and that this complaint is al|mo&s;t general throughout the whole principality of Wales, where many individuals of this re|&s;pectable order, to the great damage of their dignity, are oblig'd to have recour&s;e to very unclerical profe&s;&s;ions for the &s;upport of them|&s;elves and families.</P>
<P>This objection we will allow its full force; but then if it be con&s;ider'd that in our origi|nal e&s;timate we omitted all deans, canons, prebends, heads and fellows of colleges, chap|lains to &s;hips, regiments, and private families, together with the whole body of di&s;&s;enting mi|ni&s;ters of all denominations, field-preachers and pari&s;h-clerks, I believe we &s;hall be thought rather to have dimini&s;hed than exaggerated the real quantity.</P>
<P>As I have not been able to get admittance to the archives of the &s;everal inns of court in this metropolis, I am afraid we &s;hall not be able to determine with the &s;ame degree of cer|tainty,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
the exact number of tho&s;e who have devoted their lives and labors to the explana|tion and due execution of our municipal laws: I am therefore obliged to depend on circum|&s;tantial evidence, which, in &s;ome ca&s;es is ad|mitted even in our courts to have equal force with proof po&s;itive.</P>
<P>And here the rea&s;on of the law (as the law is the perfection of rea&s;on) is extremely clear. To illu&s;trate this by an in&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> &s;wears a robbery again&s;t <HI>B. A.</HI> may lye, or at lea&s;t be mi&s;taken; but if the goods &s;tolen from <HI>A.</HI> and previou&s;ly de&s;cribed by him, are found with their mark in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of <HI>B. B.</HI> not being able to account for &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that circum&s;tance &s;hall be deem'd of at lea&s;t equal weight again&s;t <HI>B.</HI> as if <HI>A.</HI> was to &s;wear po&s;itively to the per&s;onal iden|tity of <HI>B.</HI> This being the practice of the courts, we &s;hall proceed with all po&s;&s;ible ex|pedition (which indeed is not the practice of the courts) to produce our proofs circum&s;tan|tial. As in the former in&s;tance we have grounded our calculation on the number of pari&s;hes, we &s;hall in this derive our computation from the number of hou&s;es in the kingdom.</P>
<P>To any man tolerably acquainted with the country of England, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve that not only in every town, but almo&s;t in every hamlet thro' which he travels, his eyes are con&s;tantly caught by the appearance of a &s;mart hou&s;e, prefac'd with white rails and
<PB N="22" REF="25">
prologu'd by a red door with a bra&s;s knocker; when you de&s;ire to be acquainted with the name and quality of the owner of this man&s;ion, you are always told that it belongs to lawyer &s;uch a one: now, if a hamlet containing thirty hou&s;es, with perhaps an environ of an equal number, where labour and the fruits of the earth are the only &s;ources of wealth, can &s;upport one attorney in this rural magnificence; what an infinite number of lawyers can a commercial capital &s;u&s;tain? But becau&s;e I would rather retrench than exceed, I will only quarter one attorney upon fifty hou&s;es. The number of hou&s;es in the reign of George the Fir&s;t (&s;ince which time the quantity is con&s;iderably en|creas'd) was computed at 1,175,951. The number of attorneys then will be 23,518, and if we reckon one barri&s;ter to twenty attorneys, the &s;um total is 24,693.</P>
<P>I know it will be here objected that but one &s;mall part of this numerous body can be bene|fited by my plan, the privilege of &s;peech|ing publickly being permitted to the &s;uperior order, the barri&s;ters alone: but this critici&s;m is confin'd to the ob&s;ervation of what pa&s;&s;es merely in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, without con|&s;idering that, at every quarter and petty &s;e&s;&s;ion at all county-courts, courts-leets, courts-ba|ron, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. full power of pleading is per|mitted to every practitioner of the law.</P>
<P>As the number of tho&s;e who incorporate them&s;elves to promote, not only with their
<PB N="23" REF="26">
ca&s;h but their coun&s;el, the progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ciences, is unlimited, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for any fix'd period to a&s;certain their quantity: nor can we, with any certainty, as the Court-Regi&s;ter has been &s;ilent to the members of common-council, determine the amount of the city orators; be&s;ides, as what has been already offered is more than &s;ufficient to prove the utility of our &s;cheme from its univer&s;ality, we &s;hall not trouble our readers nor our&s;elves with any farther calculations; for tho' they are replete with great depth of knowledge, are the re&s;ult of inten&s;e application, and the vehicles of mathematical truths, yet to the million the di&s;qui&s;ition is but dry and tedious, and our pupo&s;e always was and is to mix with our in&s;truction, a proper portion of delectation.</P>
<P>We will therefore, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, ha&s;ten to the con&s;ideration of the &s;econd point pro|pos'd, viz. An enquiry into the various kinds of oratory now exi&s;ting in this country. And we &s;hall not, on this occa&s;ion, trouble our|&s;elves with the inve&s;tigation of all the &s;maller branches of this art; but, like the profe&s;&s;ors in anatomy, contenting our&s;elves with the di&s;&s;ec|tion of the noble parts, remit the examination of the ignoble ones to the care of &s;ubaltern arti&s;ts. Leaving, then, to the minute philo|&s;ophers of the age all the orators of ve&s;tries, clubs, and coffee-hou&s;es, <HI>Paulo majora cana|mus</HI>, and for the better illu&s;tration of this head, permit me, reader, to be a little fanci|ful.

The ingenious, profound Lilly, after he has led his pupils thro' the various, and almo&s;t impervious provinces of nouns, pronouns, verbs, participles, and adverbs, conducts them to the foot of that arduous and &s;tupendous mountain <HI>Qui Mihi:</HI> here dreading le&s;t his youthful ardour might be dampt with the &s;teep a&s;cent, he re-animates his &s;lacken'd nerves with the my&s;tick picture of an apple-tree, the acce&s;s to who&s;e boughs, tho' tedious and difficult, will yet be amply rewarded by leave torevel un|controul'd thro' the whole region of pepins. May the lu&s;cious fruit &s;prouting from the apex of each of my ramifications prove an equal &s;pur to every beardle&s;s orator.</P>
<P>I don't know whether the mentioning an|other order of orators, as they are not at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting in this kingdom, may not be deemed an impropriety. But as I am a &s;incere lover of my country, I can't help recommending an im|mediate importation of &s;ome of tho&s;e u&s;eful and able arti&s;ts. Sir William Temple, in his E&s;&s;ay on Poetry, has recorded their virtues; and as the race was not extingui&s;hed in his time, it is to be hoped that it &s;till remains.</P>
<P>In Ireland, &s;ays Sir William, the great men of their &s;cepts, among&s;t many officers of their family, had not only a phy&s;ician, a hunt&s;man, a &s;mith, and &s;uch like, but a poet and tale|teller.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t recorded and &s;ung the actions of their ance&s;tors, and entertained the company
<PB N="26" REF="33">
at fea&s;ts. The latter amu&s;ed them with tales when they were melancholy and could not &s;leep; and a very gallant gentleman has told me of his own experience, that in his wolf-hunting there, when he us'd to be abroad in the mountains three or four days together, and lay very ill at nights, &s;o as he could not well &s;leep, they would bring one of tho&s;e tale-tel|lers, that when he lay down would begin a &s;tory of a king, or a giant, a dwarf and a dam&s;el, and continue all night long in &s;uch an even tone that you heard him going on when|ever you awakened. And he believ'd nothing any phy&s;icians could give had &s;o good and &s;o innocent an effect to make men &s;leep in any pains or di&s;tempers of body or mind. The&s;e are Sir William Temple's words, which con|tain an amazing in&s;tance of the power of tho&s;e orators over the pa&s;&s;ions, it requiring full as much art and addre&s;s to a&s;&s;wage and quell, as to blow up, and excite a tumult in the mind.</P>
<P>In a bill not long &s;ince depending in parlia|ment for the better regulating the city-watch, a clau&s;e was recommended by a late re&s;pecta|ble magi&s;trate, that to prevent the watchmen from &s;leeping at nights on bulks (the &s;ource of many di&s;orders) the &s;aid watchmen &s;hould be compelled to &s;leep &s;ix hours in the day; an arch member &s;econded the motion, and begg'd to be included in this clau&s;e, for that being grievou&s;ly afflicted with the gout, he could not for many days &s;leep a &s;ingle wink; now
<PB N="27" REF="34">
if he could be compelled to take a &s;ix hours &s;leep every day, he apprehended that his fits would be of a much &s;horter duration. Upon this dry comment the motion was ra&s;hly re|jected; but if the hou&s;e had received the lea&s;t intimation of the a&s;toni&s;hing abilities of the Rockers (for by that appellation I choo&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h this order of orators) I am con|vinced that the above clau&s;e would not only have been receiv'd, but that proper encourage|ment would have been given by parliament for the introduction and e&s;tabli&s;hment of this u&s;eful oratorical &s;ect.</P>
<P>Nor, indeed, con&s;idering the va&s;t addition to our cu&s;tomary cares, from the unaccount|able fluctuation of our funds, the cau&s;e of con|cern to many thou&s;and individuals, do I think a vi&s;it from a convenient quantity of tho&s;e arti&s;ts would be now out of &s;ea&s;on; but how this honour is to be obtain'd, whether any of the&s;e great men are now re&s;iding among&s;t us, under the di&s;gui&s;e of chairmen and hack|ney coachmen? or, whether it would not be more advi&s;eable to employ tho&s;e gentlemen, who have &s;o lately and &s;ucce&s;sfully rummaged the Highlands of Scotland and Ireland for the remains of Runic poetry in &s;earch of the able&s;t profe&s;&s;ors, is &s;ubmitted to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts?</P>
<P>I am aware that on this occa&s;ion &s;ome arch wag, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the &s;ame &s;pirit with the above &s;enator, will object to my &s;cheme of

<P>Sir, I declare it, at the bare hearing of this here motion, I am all over in a &s;weat; for my part I can't think what gentlemen mean by talking in that there manner; not but I likes that every man &s;hould deliver his mind; I does mine, it has been ever my way, and when a member oppo&s;es me I like him the bet|ter

Now, &s;ir, I would fain a&s;k any gentleman this here que&s;tion, can any thing in nature be more natural for an Engli&s;hman than porter? I declare, Mr. Pre|&s;ident, I think it the mo&s;t whole&s;ome&s;t liquor in the world. But if it mu&s;t be a change, let us change it for rum, a whole&s;ome palatable liquor, a liquor that&mdash;in &s;hort, Mr. Pre&s;ident, I don't know &s;uch a liquor. Ay, gentlemen may &s;tare; I &s;ay, and I &s;ay it upon my con|&s;cience, I don't know &s;uch a liquor. Be&s;ides, I think there is in this here affair a point of law, which I &s;hall leave to the con&s;ideration of the learned, and for that there rea&s;on, I &s;hall take up no more of your time.</P>
