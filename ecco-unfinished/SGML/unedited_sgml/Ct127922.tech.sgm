<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THIS little publication was made for
a particular child, but the public
is welcome to the u&s;e of it. It was
found that, amid&s;t the multitude of books
profe&s;&s;edly written for children, there is
not one adapted to the comprehen&s;ion of
a child from two to three years old. A
grave remark, or a connected &s;tory, how|ever
&s;imple, is above his capacity; and</HI>
non&s;en&s;e <HI>is always below it; for Folly
is wor&s;e than Ignorance. Another great
defect is the want of</HI> good paper, <HI>a</HI>
<PB REF="3">
clear and large type, <HI>and</HI> large &s;paces.
<HI>They only, who have actually taught
young children, can be &s;en&s;ible how ne|ce&s;&s;ary
the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances are. The eye of
a child and of a learner cannot catch,
as ours can, a &s;mall, ob&s;cure, ill-formed
word, amid&s;t a number of others all
equally unknown to him.&mdash;To &s;upply
the&s;e deficiencies is the object of this book.
The ta&s;k is humble, but not mean; for
to lay the fir&s;t &s;tone of a noble building,
and to plant the fir&s;t idea in a human
mind, can be no di&s;honour to any hand.</HI></P>
