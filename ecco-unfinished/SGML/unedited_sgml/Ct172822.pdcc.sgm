<HEAD>THE TAILORS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS laughable production, was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre in the summer of <HI>1767.</HI></P>
<P>The audience received it with applause, as at that time disputes about wages between the journeymen and master Tailors, ran so high, as to render them the sub|ject of general notice and conversation.</P>
<P>The author of the Tailors remains unknown. The manuscript was sent to Mr. Foote, who was requested to bring it forward at his Theatre, if he thought its merits were such, as to give it a chance of success, if not, it was to be returned.</P>
<P>Foote approved highly of the piece, and took a part in it. Its reception, in every respect justified his good opinion.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that this admirable burlesque is not more frequently performed; and to the manager of the Haymarket Theatre Royal we recommend its revival on the commencement of his next season.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. WRITTEN BY DAVID GARRICK, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<L>THIS night we add some heroes to our store,</L>
<L>Who never were as heroes known before:</L>
<L>No blust'ring Romans, Trojans, Greeks, shall rage,</L>
<L>No knights arm'd <HI>cap-&agrave;-pie</HI> shall croud our stage;</L>
<L>Nor shall our Henrys, Edwards, take the field,</L>
<L>Opposing sword to sword, and shield to shield:</L>
<L>With different instuments our troop appears,</L>
<L>Needles to thimbles shall, and sheers to sheers.</L>
<L>With parchment gorgets, and in buckram arm'd,</L>
<L>Cold-blooded Tailors are to heroes warm'd,</L>
<L>And slip-shod slide to war. No lion's glare,</L>
<L>No eye-balls darting fire, shall make you stare;</L>
<L>Each outside shall belie the stuff within,</L>
<L>A Roman spirit in a Tailor's skin.</L>
<L>A cross-legg'd Cassius, Pompey, shall you see,</L>
<L>And the ninth part of Brutus strut in me.</L>
<L>What tho' no swords we draw, no daggers shake,</L>
<L>Yet can our warriors a "quietus make,</L>
<L>"With a bare bodkin."&mdash;Then be dumb, ye raillers,</L>
<L>And never, but in honour, call out <HI>Tailors</HI>!</L>
<L>But are these heroes tragic, you will cry?</L>
<L>Oh, very tragic&mdash;and I'll tell you why&mdash;</L>
<L>Should female artists with the male combine,</L>
<L>And Mantua-makers to the Tailors join,</L>
<L>Should all, too proud to work, their trades give o'er,</L>
<L>Not to be soften'd by the sixpence more,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6">What horrors would ensue!&mdash;First, you, ye beaux,</L>
<L>Would forfeit all existence with your cloaths.</L>
<L>Then you, ye fair, where would be your defence?</L>
<L>This is no golden age of innocence.</L>
<L>Should drunken Bacchanals the Graces meet,</L>
<L>And no <HI>police</HI> protect the naked street,</L>
<L>Beauty is weak, and passion bold and strong:</L>
<L>Oh! then&mdash;&mdash;but modesty restrains my tongue.</L>
<L>May this night's bard a skilful Tailor be,</L>
<L>And like a well-made coat his Tragedy:</L>
<L>Tho' close, yet easy; decent, but not dull;</L>
<L>Short, but not scanty; without buckram, full!</L>

<L>At little Phalim's, where I lodge; I rose,</L>
<L>Went with M'Carty, and my Irish boys;</L>
<L>Each of us took a broomstick in our hands,</L>

<L>I'll tell thee. Well thou know'st</L>
<L>Ere cruel fortune sunk me thus to earth,</L>
<L>As chief, the box was ever at my nod:</L>
<L>This trust of right to every chief belongs:</L>

<L>Besides, I know they doubt, and turn their eyes</L>
<L>On me to fix their choice; thou art the man:</L>
<L>The public box supplies thy capital.</L>
<L>But oh, my friend, remember, when you've reach'd</L>
<L>This envied pinnacle of Tailors' greatness,</L>
<L>Never to violate the public faith!</L>
<L>On that firm base alone your power will stand:</L>
<L>The account is monthly; ere that time returns,</L>
<L>From the first profits you repay the box.</L>
